[12:10] word in the name of the Lord
[12:13] Jesus amen amen let us go to Daniel
[12:17] chapter
[12:20] 2 Daniel chapter
[12:23] 2 we are reading from verse 44 up to 45
[12:35] so the Bible
[12:36] says and in the days of these Kings
[12:39] shall the king of Heaven set up a
[12:42] kingdom which shall never be destroyed
[12:45] and the kingdom shall not be left to
[12:47] other people but it shall break in
[12:49] pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[12:53] and it shall stand
[12:57] forever
[13:16] for as much as those so a stone cut out
[13:19] of the mountain without hands and that
[13:22] it break in pieces the iron the brass
[13:25] the clay the silver and the gold the
[13:28] great God has made known to the king
[13:31] what shall come to pass Hereafter and
[13:34] the dream is certain and the
[13:36] interpretation
[13:57] there
[14:01] may God bless of his
[14:03] word you may be
[14:07] seated so this
[14:10] morning we have only one
[14:13] service but immediately after this
[14:15] service we going to have the youth
[14:19] meeting for just one hour so I want to
[14:22] preach this
[14:24] morning building the kingdom together
[14:30] praise the name of the Lord our pastor
[14:32] has been taking us through the CES of
[14:34] the
[14:37] Kingdom praise the name of our Lord and
[14:40] then you know how we told you know like
[14:43] in John chapter
[14:46] 14 where the Bible says in my father's
[14:49] house are many
[14:53] mansions and the and the house meant a
[14:57] kingdom praise the name of our Lord and
[15:00] then now the Mansion are the positions
[15:02] or the places we occupy in the body of
[15:05] Jesus
[15:08] Christ now here when we look at this
[15:11] scripture we have
[15:13] read Nebuchadnezzar was the king at that
[15:18] time when the children of Israel were in
[15:23] captivity actually it is
[15:25] Nebuchadnezzar who took the children of
[15:28] Israel
[15:30] into
[15:31] captivity praise the name of our Lord
[15:34] and then we see at that time from the
[15:37] time the kingdoms of the
[15:41] Gentiles started ruling over
[15:45] Israel or started having dominion over
[15:50] Jerusalem that's where the times of the
[15:53] Gentiles started
[15:55] from and we can see that from the time
[15:58] of
[16:00] Nebuchadnezzar up to now it is the
[16:03] Gentile
[16:05] kingdoms that are having rule over
[16:09] Jerusalem you can imagine Israel
[16:12] now that their Capital according to the
[16:16] world capital
[16:20] city is not
[16:22] Jerusalem but it
[16:25] is and then the world Nations
[16:29] has declared Jerusalem to be an
[16:32] international
[16:35] City in other words Jerusalem doesn't
[16:37] belong to the
[16:39] Jews so it is still under the Dominion
[16:42] of the
[16:44] Gentiles you find that East
[16:47] Jerusalem where many historical sites
[16:50] are is ruled by the Palestinians or the
[16:52] Muslim
[16:57] nations like you can imagine the Temple
[17:00] Mount is being ruled by either Jordan or
[17:05] Lebanon not Israel
[17:07] itself so you see that there we are
[17:10] still having the Gentile
[17:13] times praise the name of the Lord and
[17:15] they started in the times of
[17:19] Nebuchadnezzar now we see that
[17:21] Nebuchadnezzar he had a
[17:24] dream and when he had that dream he
[17:27] forgot the dream and then
[17:31] Daniel sought the
[17:33] Lord and then the lord gave him the
[17:36] interpretation of the
[17:39] dream praise the name of and you see the
[17:42] way God
[17:44] works that even during the times of
[17:48] Joseph Pharaoh had a dream so you see
[17:53] how the Lord
[17:54] works that he even uses world leaders
[17:59] to show them what is going to
[18:02] be to prepare for the Times
[18:05] ahead if far didn't have that
[18:08] dream and maybe somebody else had a
[18:11] dream maybe the preparations wouldn't
[18:13] have
[18:15] been but faraoh being the ruler of the
[18:19] world he got a dream and then he left
[18:22] the
[18:23] interpretation and then Joseph came and
[18:26] gave the
[18:27] interpretation saying that there are
[18:29] going to be seven years of plentiful
[18:33] Harvest and then there will be another
[18:35] seven years of
[18:38] fine so now it was in the heart of
[18:41] faraoh to make such
[18:44] preparations praise the name of our Lord
[18:46] to prepare for such a
[18:49] season now brother Bram teaches us God
[18:53] cannot give you a
[18:55] dream of symbols and signs
[19:01] if he has not put there a person to
[19:03] interpret
[19:05] it praise the name of our Lord but we
[19:08] see we are living in a
[19:10] time that many people get
[19:13] dreams and they always seek
[19:16] interpreters you know then there's a
[19:18] church called dream Church
[19:22] in then there is another one in they say
[19:25] we come with your dreams and we tell you
[19:27] what they mean
[19:31] but when God does not put there somebody
[19:33] to interpret those
[19:36] symbols he will give you an open
[19:40] dream like
[19:42] Joseph the husband of Mary he got a
[19:46] dream when he was thinking of putting
[19:49] Mary
[19:51] aside then God told him then you told
[19:54] him don't fear to take Mary it was an
[19:58] open
[19:59] dream the three wise
[20:02] men when they had gone to visit to
[20:04] worship
[20:05] Christ and the Lord knew what Herod was
[20:09] planning but then God came at night and
[20:13] then told them don't go by the same way
[20:17] go by another way and then even now
[20:21] Joseph he also got a dream the Lord told
[20:25] telling him take the child to Egypt
[20:28] so God gives us an open
[20:31] dream praise the name of our Lord and
[20:33] then you know some people want to best
[20:35] their decisions on the dreams they
[20:39] make but some dreams can be correct some
[20:43] dreams can be
[20:44] false so you shouldn't build your life
[20:48] based on dreaming we have the word of
[20:51] God where we can build our
[20:54] life praise the name of our Lord you
[20:57] check your dream
[20:59] with the word of God praise the name of
[21:02] our Lord and let the word of God be our
[21:05] guidance all the
[21:07] time so now we see here in the
[21:10] scriptures that in Daniel chapter
[21:13] 2 praise the name of our Lord let us go
[21:17] follow up that dream of
[21:20] Nebuchadnezzar verse
[21:22] 36 it says this is the
[21:25] dream and we will tell the inter ration
[21:28] thereof to the
[21:32] king
[21:34] king at the King of Kings for the Lord
[21:38] of Heaven has given
[21:41] you a
[21:43] kingdom power and strength and
[21:47] glory and whereever the children of men
[21:53] dwell the Beast of the
[21:57] field of the
[21:59] hair has given in thine
[22:02] hand and has made you ruler over
[22:06] all though at the head of
[22:09] God because nebz saw the head of
[22:14] God and then he saw the breasts and arms
[22:16] of
[22:18] silver and then he saw the belly and the
[22:21] thighs of
[22:26] brass and then he saw the legs and the
[22:29] feet of iron and
[22:32] [Music]
[22:34] Clay now these were four Gentile
[22:39] kingdoms that were going to lose the
[22:43] world until Christ comes down to L the
[22:47] world praise the name of our Lord so
[22:50] then what we are what we see
[22:52] here from the time of
[22:55] Nebuchadnezzar up to now we are still
[22:58] under those four
[23:01] kingdoms because Christ has not come to
[23:03] take over the millennial reign of this
[23:07] world now the first kingdom was
[23:11] Babylon the head of God praise the name
[23:15] of the Lord and then now Daniel
[23:18] interpreted this
[23:20] dream that you are the head of
[23:23] God in verse
[23:25] 39 and after you
[23:29] shall arise a kingdom inferior to you
[23:32] and another third Kingdom of the brass
[23:34] which shall bear rule over the
[23:48] earth now we see that it is in the times
[23:52] of
[23:54] Daniel that the king the first kingdom
[23:57] was fulfilled
[23:59] and it was still in the time of
[24:02] Daniel that the second Kingdom succeeded
[24:06] the first
[24:07] Kingdom which was the Babylonian
[24:10] Kingdom when we go to Daniel chter
[24:14] 5 and then verse
[24:17] 30 the Bible says in that night was Bel
[24:22] the king
[24:26] of
[24:30] and Darius the median took the kingdom
[24:33] being about three and years
[24:44] old so now the media and persan
[24:50] kingdom was the kingdom of the breast
[24:53] and the arms of
[24:56] silver is the kingdom that succeeded the
[25:00] Babylonian
[25:03] Kingdom now we see that Satan here
[25:06] also has been building his
[25:10] kingdom praise the name of the Lord from
[25:13] one Kingdom to another
[25:16] kingdom you know he from the ruling over
[25:19] the
[25:20] world and taking over the leadership of
[25:24] Jerusalem started by the Babylonian King
[25:28] and then he went into the persan
[25:31] kingdom which were the arms and the
[25:33] breast of
[25:35] silver and then from the Persian
[25:38] Kingdom he went to the Greece
[25:42] Kingdom which was actually the Bell and
[25:45] the size of
[25:50] brass now from the Greek
[25:53] Kingdom then he comes to the Roman
[25:56] Kingdom
[25:58] which at the legs of iron and feet of
[26:01] legs and feet of clay and
[26:05] iron praise the name of our Lord and now
[26:09] we are still living under the Roman
[26:13] Kingdom according to the
[26:15] scriptures our Lord Jesus Christ was
[26:18] born under the Roman
[26:21] Kingdom the first coming of the Lord he
[26:25] comes when the Roman Kingdom
[26:29] and now the second coming of the Lord he
[26:32] comes when to still the Roman
[26:35] Kingdom and even now during the third
[26:38] coming of the law he comes when the
[26:41] Roman
[26:42] Kingdom to destroy the all of it and
[26:45] establish his rule on
[26:47] Earth so right now we are still living
[26:50] under the Roman
[26:52] Kingdom Under the
[26:54] scriptures in the days of Jesus Christ
[26:57] the Roman kingdom was an emperor
[27:01] Rome it was being ruled by the
[27:05] empires you know the
[27:08] Emperors but during the ages it turned
[27:12] from the
[27:13] Emperors to the
[27:16] pope praise the name of our Lord they
[27:18] are still the rulers of the
[27:20] world now they got into the spiritual
[27:23] aspect and now in Revelations chapter 13
[27:28] the Bible tells us that the Beast is
[27:31] going to rule the world and everything
[27:34] is gearing up to
[27:36] that to make sure that the Beast the man
[27:40] of sin lules the world we are still
[27:43] living under the Roman
[27:45] Empire but our Lord Jesus Christ the
[27:49] Bible says where we've read in Daniel
[27:52] chapter
[27:53] 2 that I saw a
[27:55] stone praise the name of our
[27:58] that was cut without
[28:00] hands let us go to Daniel
[28:06] 2:35 let us start from
[28:11] verse let us start from verse
[28:14] 31 get the
[28:16] background though oh King sawest and
[28:18] behold a great image this great image
[28:22] whose brightness was excellent stood
[28:24] before them and the form thereof was ter
[28:40] this image's head was of fine gold his
[28:44] breast and his arms of silver his Bell
[28:47] and his thighs of
[28:56] brass
[29:02] his legs of iron his feet and part of
[29:05] iron and part of
[29:11] clay though so is still a stone was cut
[29:15] out without hands which smot the image
[29:18] upon his feet that were of iron and clay
[29:22] and break them to
[29:26] pieces
[29:35] was the iron the clay the brass the
[29:39] silver the gold broken to pieces
[29:42] together and became like the cha of the
[29:45] saming FL and the wind carried them away
[29:49] and no place was found for them and the
[29:51] stone and the and the stone that smot
[29:54] the image became a great mountain and
[29:58] fill the whole
[30:08] [Music]
[30:23] earth praise the name of the Lord so we
[30:25] see that all the king OMS of the
[30:29] world praise the name of our Lord they
[30:31] all all the powers that have
[30:35] been have been able to congregate into
[30:39] or to sum up in the last
[30:44] Kingdom until when the stone is
[30:47] cut it comes and destroys all the
[30:52] components which were in the first
[30:55] Kingdom bonian Kingdom second Kingdom
[31:00] the made pers
[31:02] Kingdom the third Kingdom that was the
[31:05] Greek Kingdom and the fourth Kingdom
[31:09] which is the Roman Kingdom
[31:11] now I want us just relate this with
[31:15] another scripture
[31:17] here let us go to Daniel chapter
[31:21] 7 praise the name of the Lord and then
[31:24] we look at verse one he says in the
[31:28] first of Bel king of Babylon Daniel had
[31:31] the dream and visions of his head upon
[31:33] his bed then he wrote the dream and told
[31:36] the of the
[31:42] [Music]
[31:55] matters Daniel SP SP and said I saw in
[31:58] my vision by night and behold the Four
[32:01] Winds of Heaven stood upon the great sea
[32:05] and four great beasts come from the sea
[32:09] diverse one from
[32:26] another
[32:35] now he says he saw great
[32:39] beasts four great
[32:41] beasts come out of the
[32:44] Sea and the Bible tells us praise the
[32:47] name of the Lord in
[32:50] Revelation chapter
[32:53] 17 praise the name of the Lord and then
[32:56] verse
[32:58] and he said unto me the waters which th
[33:04] sest where the was
[33:07] sth are the peoples and the
[33:12] multitudes and the Nations and the towns
[33:16] and then Daniel says I saw great
[33:20] beasts and the Beast can also stand for
[33:24] power come out of the sea
[33:27] what is the sea people Nations
[33:32] tongues so he says I saw beasts coming
[33:35] out and then he says the first Beast was
[33:39] like a
[33:40] lion and then verse five and another
[33:45] Beast the second one was like a
[33:48] bear and then verse six it says and the
[33:52] third Beast was like
[33:55] leopard and then s and I saw in the
[33:59] night
[34:00] vision Behold a fourth
[34:04] Beast so we see that the first Beast
[34:07] here in in Daniel 7
[34:12] verse4 which was like a lion was the
[34:15] Babylonian
[34:16] Kingdom and then the second beast which
[34:19] was like a bear was the made persan
[34:24] Kingdom and then we see that the third
[34:26] Beast
[34:28] which was like a
[34:29] Le was like that Greek
[34:33] Kingdom and then the seventh the fourth
[34:37] Beast the fourth Beast which was
[34:42] Dreadful and
[34:44] terrible and strong
[34:46] exceedingly was the Roman
[34:49] Kingdom now you see that all these
[34:53] Powers the lion you know the power of
[34:57] that Beast which was like
[34:59] Lion the powers of the Babylonian
[35:02] Kingdom and then the median
[35:05] Kingdom then the Greek Kingdom they all
[35:08] congregate into the fourth
[35:12] Beast the Roman
[35:14] Kingdom and we go to Revelations
[35:17] 1 and then verse
[35:20] one praise the name of our Lord the
[35:23] Bible
[35:24] says and I stood up upon the sand of the
[35:30] [Music]
[35:32] sea and so a beast rise up out of the
[35:37] sea and we said the sea is what
[35:42] people this same is matching with
[35:46] Daniel and then he says having seven
[35:50] heads and 10
[35:52] horn and upon his horns 10
[35:55] crowns
[35:58] and upon his head the name of
[36:02] B now look at
[36:05] verse and now this
[36:08] Beast is being
[36:11] described and he said I saw it like a
[36:18] Le Greek
[36:21] Kingdom praise the name of the Lord and
[36:24] the feet were of a bear
[36:28] Persian
[36:30] Kingdom and the mouth like a mouth of a
[36:36] lion Babylonian
[36:38] Kingdom and the
[36:40] dragon which is
[36:42] Satan gave him his
[36:45] power and his
[36:47] seat and great
[36:50] Authority praise the name of the Lord so
[36:53] all the devil has been
[36:55] building
[36:57] building his
[37:00] kingdom and brother Bram teaches us
[37:03] Satan has also been working on his
[37:08] Eden he has been building his Eden for
[37:11] 6,000
[37:13] years the way God took 6,000 to make the
[37:16] Garden of
[37:19] Eden even Satan has been taking
[37:23] 6,000 to build his enemy at the end of
[37:27] his Eden he wants to rule the
[37:31] world and now he fulfills it in the
[37:35] times that we are
[37:37] living praise the name of our Lord that
[37:39] there is a union of
[37:41] religions all of them coming together to
[37:45] do what to Crown the
[37:48] [Music]
[37:50] Beast praise the name of our Lord and
[37:52] then in Revelation
[37:55] 13:8
[37:57] here is
[37:58] wisdom let te that has
[38:01] understanding count the number of the
[38:04] Beast for it is the number of a
[38:08] man and his name is 6003
[38:14] and6 so the Beast is a
[38:17] man praise the name of our Lord in the
[38:20] beginning in Genesis in the Garden of
[38:23] Eden the Beast was the
[38:27] serent but we saw what the serpent did
[38:31] that was able to get his
[38:33] seed to bring forth King and now we see
[38:36] that in the end time the Beast is a man
[38:40] and he comes from among many
[38:42] people and when you read Revelation 17
[38:45] and
[38:46] 18 the woman sits on the
[38:49] B and the woman is the Fallen Church
[38:53] mystery Babylon sitting on the man
[38:57] leading and then the man sits on the
[39:00] seat of
[39:01] Satan and great Authority and power is
[39:05] given unto
[39:08] him so now the devil has been building
[39:11] his
[39:12] kingdom but as the devil builds his
[39:15] kingom even God has been
[39:18] building praise the name of God has also
[39:22] been building
[39:23] his as the devil builds his God has also
[39:27] been building this King now we need to
[39:29] ask our Sinners of whose kingdom are
[39:33] you praise the name of the Lord of whose
[39:36] kingdom are
[39:37] you of whose building are
[39:42] you of whose Temple are
[39:47] you praise the name of our the devil has
[39:50] been building
[39:51] his and his
[39:54] climax is when he's worshiping
[39:58] by all the nations and it is going to
[40:00] come to pass that for 3 and a half years
[40:04] they will worship the devil whoever will
[40:06] not worship the devil will be put to
[40:09] death that's the scripture here let us
[40:13] read Revelations chapter
[40:15] 13 pray the name of our Lord and then
[40:19] verse
[40:21] four and they worshiped the dragon which
[40:25] gave power unto the Beast beast and they
[40:27] worshiped the Beast saying who is like
[40:30] unto the
[40:36] [Music]
[40:39] Beast praise the name of Lord who is
[40:42] like the dragon who is like the Beast so
[40:47] we need to check
[40:48] ourselves where is your heart
[40:52] now praise the name of our Lord where is
[40:54] your heart's desire
[40:57] where are your
[40:58] intent do you worship Science and
[41:02] Technology do you worship
[41:05] education do you worship your
[41:08] wealth do you worship your
[41:12] culture or you worship your
[41:15] religion or you worship the true Living
[41:19] God praise the name of our Lord so now
[41:22] let us go back to Daniel chapter
[41:25] 2
[41:27] praise the name of the Lord Daniel 2 and
[41:30] then verse
[41:34] 35 so the Bible
[41:37] says then was the iron the clay the
[41:41] brass the silver the gold broken to
[41:44] pieces together and became like the
[41:47] chaff of the summer th FL and the wind
[41:50] carried them away that no place was
[41:53] found for them and the stone that M the
[41:56] image became a great mountain and filled
[41:59] the whole
[42:03] [Music]
[42:23] earth praise the name of the Lord so the
[42:26] says the stone SM the
[42:29] image the SM sm all the kingdoms of the
[42:34] world in Revelations chapter 19 Christ
[42:38] coming down on the White Horse and takes
[42:41] over all the kingdoms of the
[42:43] world at the end of this world and so
[42:47] the Bible says that
[42:50] stone became a great
[42:53] mountain and filled the whole Earth
[42:58] let us go to verse
[43:00] 44 and in the days of these Kings shall
[43:03] the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which
[43:07] shall never be destroyed and the kingdom
[43:10] shall not be left to other people but it
[43:12] shall break in pieces and consume all
[43:15] these kingdoms and shall stand
[43:25] forever
[43:39] praise the name of the Lord so he says
[43:41] in the days of these
[43:44] Kings which Kings the kingdoms of this
[43:49] world God has been establishing his
[43:53] kingdom praise the name of our Lord God
[43:55] has been been getting members for his
[43:59] kingdom as the gospel has been going
[44:02] forth he has been getting
[44:04] members he has been
[44:07] recruiting members of his kingdom people
[44:10] who were turning away from sin people
[44:13] were turning away from Evil you know
[44:16] they were getting into the kingdom of
[44:18] God so God has been going
[44:21] through getting his members for his
[44:25] kingdom making them New Creations in
[44:28] Christ filling them with the Holy Spirit
[44:32] praise the name of our Lord are you part
[44:34] of that Kingdom praise the name of the
[44:37] Lord we are children of the king we are
[44:40] part of the kingdom of God praise the
[44:43] name of our Lord the one that the Bible
[44:45] says our
[44:47] citizenship is in heaven praise the name
[44:50] of our just as you a citizen here you
[44:53] become a citizen by birth
[44:58] so even in heaven you become a citizen
[45:02] by the new bir praise the name of our
[45:05] Lord by the birth with our Lord Jesus
[45:07] Christ by being born from above so now
[45:11] the Bible is telling in the days of this
[45:14] King God has been setting up his
[45:18] King so now the question comes to us are
[45:22] you part of that kingdom are you part of
[45:24] the Heavenly Kingdom
[45:26] or you are just thinking about the
[45:28] kingdom of this now if you are part of
[45:31] the kingdom of God praise the name of
[45:34] you have become a building
[45:37] Stone praise the name of our Lord you
[45:39] have become part of the temple of
[45:42] God and then the Bible says we are
[45:46] Lively
[45:47] Stones praise the name of our Lord we
[45:50] are living
[45:51] stones of the kingdom of God we are
[45:55] living stones
[45:56] of of the temple of God let us go to
[45:59] First Peter chapter
[46:02] 2 and then verse
[46:05] 5 praise the name of our Lord First
[46:09] Peter chapter
[46:11] 2 and then verse
[46:14] five so the Bible says you also are
[46:18] Lively Stones I built up a spiritual
[46:22] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[46:25] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[46:28] by Jesus
[46:32] [Music]
[46:42] Christ the Bible says we are Lively
[46:46] Stones we are building a spiritual
[46:49] house we are under
[46:51] construction we are building the kingdom
[46:54] of God the name of our Lord we are
[46:57] Lively Stone why it is the spirit of God
[47:02] that dwells in Us Praise the name of our
[47:05] Lord It's the spirit of God that we have
[47:08] given our lives to and the Lord have
[47:11] given you all my life take over all my
[47:14] life praise the name of the Lord that
[47:16] you are no longer yourself but it is the
[47:19] spirit of God that is living in you
[47:23] making you a lively St and then you are
[47:26] building a spiritual
[47:28] house praise the name of our Lord like
[47:31] in the Old Testament when they were
[47:33] building the
[47:34] Temple praise the name of our Lord let
[47:37] us go to First Kings chapter
[47:42] 5 praise the name of the Lord First
[47:45] Kings 5 and verse
[47:51] 18 so the Bible
[47:54] says
[47:56] and Solomon's Builders and Ham's
[47:59] Builders did H them let us start from
[48:02] verse 17 and the King commanded and they
[48:05] brought great Stones costly stones and
[48:09] held stones to L the foundation of the
[48:24] house
[48:26] the Bible says they were great
[48:29] Stones
[48:31] costly they had already been caught from
[48:34] different rocks all over the
[48:37] world and then the Bible says in verse
[48:40] 18 and Solomon's Builders and Ham's
[48:43] Builders did H them and the stone
[48:46] squares so they prepared the Timber and
[48:50] the stones to build the
[48:54] house
[49:09] praise the name of the Lord they were
[49:12] preparing to build the
[49:15] temple but they picked stones from
[49:17] different
[49:19] areas they went in different countries
[49:22] they were picking Stones praise the name
[49:25] of Allah
[49:26] like maybe they would go to this
[49:28] Village and then they pick a stone they
[49:30] go to another Village they pick a stone
[49:33] they go to another country they pick a
[49:35] stone and this is what the Lord is doing
[49:38] now praise the name of our Lord he's
[49:41] picking a stone maybe comes to your CL
[49:44] you are the only stone that he
[49:46] picks praise the name of our Lord maybe
[49:49] comes to your class and you the only
[49:51] Stone he picks maybe comes you know to
[49:54] your kind of of profession whatever
[49:56] you're doing and you the only one he
[49:59] picks they were picking them from
[50:01] different
[50:03] places praise the name of our Lord and
[50:05] then they brought them to
[50:08] Jerusalem praise the name of our Lord we
[50:10] are Lively stones and they were picking
[50:13] them at different
[50:15] times different
[50:17] seasons praise the name of our Lord
[50:19] building the kingdom of
[50:22] God praise the name of our Lord and then
[50:24] the Bible
[50:26] in First Kings 6 and verse
[50:31] 7 and the house when it was in
[50:36] building was built of stone made ready
[50:40] before it was brought here so that there
[50:43] was neither
[50:44] hmer nor axe nor any tool of iron had in
[50:49] the house while it was in the
[50:54] building
[51:09] now you look at the inspiration of God
[51:12] look at the leadership of God different
[51:17] Builders different
[51:19] servants we are sent out in different
[51:23] places go you to all the
[51:26] World praise the name of our Lord and
[51:29] preach this gospel this Gospel of the
[51:32] Kingdom shall reach to All
[51:34] Nations why getting those livel stones
[51:39] together praise the name of our Lord so
[51:41] the Bible says when they brought them
[51:44] for construction in
[51:46] Jerusalem no stone was
[51:49] cut no stone was sh but where they were
[51:53] picked from by by inspiration of God
[51:57] they had a position to feel in the body
[52:00] of Jesus
[52:02] Christ and each and every one of us as a
[52:06] Lively Stone we have a place to fit in
[52:09] the
[52:10] king praise the name of our Lord now
[52:13] start asking yourself which place do you
[52:15] fit in the
[52:18] king praise the name of Lord which
[52:21] position are you in the body of
[52:23] Christ if you have recognized your

[52:29] building and you are able to build the
[52:32] kingdom of

[52:37] the message Elisha the
[52:42] prophet he says and no matter where the
[52:45] person

[52:50] Believer God in some
[52:53] way will get the true message to
[52:58] them just as certain as he is
[53:02] God scattered
[53:05] Stones different places maybe it is a
[53:08] stone that is at a drinking
[53:12] joint maybe it a stone that's in a
[53:15] prostitute

[53:43] somebody's
[53:47] heart somewhere they will write to
[53:52] them they will hear a testimony they
[53:55] will turn the radio on or something
[53:58] another they will hear the true
[54:00] message God will grant that to
[54:04] them praise the name
[54:06] of God he knows where this stones

[54:13] ourselves we need to
[54:16] participate in the building of this
[54:19] Temple praise the name of the Lord we
[54:21] need to build together this
[54:24] Tabernacle
[54:25] we need to build together this Kingdom
[54:28] if you have identified yourself as part
[54:31] of the Kingdom there is still another
[54:33] stone that is
[54:35] outside we need to see how we can go and
[54:38] pick those
[54:39] stones to get the stones in praise the
[54:43] name of our Lord we need to build the
[54:44] kingdom
[54:46] together praise the name of our Lord now
[54:49] in this

[55:06] to how to J by oats to
[55:12] Jerusalem the tall seders of
[55:17] Lebanon which is overlaid with gold in
[55:20] the
[55:23] temple there was not a sound so there
[55:27] was not a sound of a s
[55:32] somewhere here is one thing that they
[55:35] did and that's one thing the church is
[55:38] doing
[55:39] today The Ting of the first
[55:43] Tabernacle a stationary
[55:48] Tabernacle from being 10 to 10 to place
[55:51] to
[55:54] place
[55:57] he says they started the
[55:59] building and they went so
[56:02] far and they found
[56:04] out a funny looking
[56:09] Stone it was an OD
[56:13] Stone it didn't look like the rest of
[56:17] this and they rejected it and throw it
[56:21] over into the we
[56:23] pile
[56:28] they said that stone won't fit in this
[56:32] building and they picked it out in the
[56:34] we
[56:36] pile but they kept coming up to a
[56:40] certain
[56:41] place they kept running into a
[56:44] place and after a while they had a hall
[56:47] in the
[56:48] [Music]
[56:49] building and they didn't have nothing
[56:52] would fit
[56:53] it
[56:55] that's where you churches is to go
[56:59] today your
[57:01] denomination you built and you've
[57:04] plastered and got your
[57:07] buildings but you find there is a hall
[57:10] there
[57:12] somewhere what did they

[57:22] cornner praise the name of our Lord in
[57:24] building of the first
[57:26] Tabernacle the Temple of
[57:29] Solomon you know every stone was picked
[57:31] from a different
[57:32] place and then they brought them to
[57:36] Jerusalem and then when the builders
[57:38] started
[57:39] building they looked at a furn
[57:42] stone and they couldn't understand it
[57:45] then they bu said no this Stone let us
[57:47] put it away and then they kept on
[57:50] building now when they reached at the
[57:53] completion
[57:55] they found there was a space
[57:57] somewhere but the building had already
[58:00] been built now when they looked at it
[58:03] carefully the stone which was so
[58:07] funny the stone which the builders
[58:11] rejected was meant to be the chief
[58:16] corner and that was our Lord Jesus
[58:19] Christ is Jesus Christ in your
[58:23] heart
[58:25] that's now the question if Christ is not

[59:19] marvelous in our
[59:23] eyes
[59:32] praise the name of the Lord they
[59:35] rejected the
[59:36] stone God never gave them inspiration at
[59:39] that
[59:41] time that this is what you start
[59:44] with but they rejected it what was it it
[59:48] was a
[59:49] prophecy that this Temple they building
[59:52] is going to be
[59:53] broken
[59:55] praise the name of the Lord and the
[59:56] temple was

[1:08:35] one the Bible says and the Lord spoke
[1:08:38] unto Moses saying Speak unto the
[1:08:41] children of Israel that they bring me an
[1:08:44] offering of every man that giveth it
[1:08:48] willingly with his heart he shall take

[1:12:16] and then we see here in verse 36 rather
[1:12:20] in chapter
[1:12:22] 36 and then verse 1 to verse
[1:12:26] 7 the bible
[1:12:31] says let us start from verse
[1:12:38] three let start from verse one okay then
[1:12:41] wrote Bal and a AIA and every
[1:12:45] wise-hearted man in whom the Lord put
[1:12:48] wisdom and understanding to know how to
[1:12:51] work all manner of work for the service
[1:12:53] of the son Sanctuary according to all
[1:12:55] that the Lord had
[1:13:19] commanded and Moses called bzel and aor
[1:13:23] and every wise-hearted man in whose
[1:13:25] heart the Lord had put wisdom even
[1:13:28] everyone whose heart steered him up to
[1:13:31] come unto the work to come up and do the
[1:13:51] work and they received of Moses all the
[1:13:54] offering which the children of Israel
[1:13:57] had brought for the work of the service
[1:13:59] of the sanctuary to make it with and
[1:14:02] they brought yet unto him free offerings
[1:14:06] every
[1:14:09] [Music]
[1:14:22] morning
[1:14:24] and and all the wise men that wrote all
[1:14:28] the work of the sanctuary came every man
[1:14:30] from his work which they
[1:14:34] [Music]
[1:14:43] made and they spoke unto Moses saying
[1:14:46] the people bring much more than enough
[1:14:49] for the service of the work which the
[1:14:51] Lord commanded to make
[1:15:02] and Moses gave commandment and they caus
[1:15:05] it to be proclaimed throughout the camp
[1:15:07] saying let neither man nor a woman make
[1:15:11] any more work for the offering of the
[1:15:13] sanctuary so the people were restrained
[1:15:16] from
[1:15:22] bringing
[1:15:32] for the stuff that was was sufficient
[1:15:36] for all the work to make it and
[1:15:47] too praise the name of the Lord a call
[1:15:50] was
[1:15:51] given bring
[1:15:54] to make the
[1:15:55] sanctuary and people were so
[1:15:59] willing the Bible says they brought too
[1:16:03] much and they said no we have got
[1:16:07] enough but the mission
[1:16:10] field has not got
[1:16:13] enough praise the name of the Lord be

[1:16:33] but I'm
[1:16:35] stuck until literally the money you have
[1:16:38] you pull it
[1:16:40] out but the burden is not to one
[1:16:44] person or to a few individuals the
[1:16:47] burden is for the whole
[1:16:49] body and as a whole church we need to
[1:16:53] have that same

[1:25:34] 45 so the Bible
[1:25:44] says then shall he answer them saying
[1:25:48] very I say unto you in as much as you
[1:25:50] did not to one of the least of these you
[1:25:54] did it not to
[1:26:03] me what a

[1:26:08] for
[1:26:09] yourself you bought the other thing you
[1:26:12] bought the other thing you have too much
[1:26:15] until you waste
[1:26:17] it when another is going hungry and
[1:26:21] you're not concerned somebody doesn't
[1:26:23] have food somebody doesn't have
[1:26:26] this so it's
[1:26:28] wasteful and then the Lord says just as
[1:26:31] you didn't do it to them you have not
[1:26:34] done it unto
[1:26:36] me and brother Bram teaches in the
[1:26:39] message that day on
[1:26:41] Calvary that eternal life is living for
[1:26:46] others praise the name of our Lord
[1:26:49] living for

[1:27:21] taking time interceding for somebody
[1:27:25] picking from what you have and helping
[1:27:28] another praise the name of Jesus didn't
[1:27:31] come to live for
[1:27:33] himself but he came to live for us to
[1:27:36] die for us that we can be like him and
[1:27:39] if we have the same Spirit of
[1:27:42] Christ we shall live for others if we
[1:27:45] have the same Spirit of
[1:27:47] Christ we shall participate in the
[1:27:49] Kingdom
[1:27:51] of praise the name of our Lord where you
[1:27:54] give your
[1:27:55] life praise the name of our Lord and you
[1:27:58] know like on the day of Pentecost when
[1:28:01] Peter had preached they asked him men
[1:28:04] and Brethren what shall we

[1:28:11] shall I
[1:28:13] do praise the name of the Lord where am
[1:28:16] I
[1:28:17] participating what is my contribution to
[1:28:19] the kingdom
[1:28:21] of we need to build the kingdom
[1:28:24] together and don't leave it to the other
[1:28:27] how about you if you are part of it be
[1:28:32] concerned praise the name of the Lord be
[1:28:35] concerned pray about it
[1:28:39] intered find out the
[1:28:41] needs give to the
[1:28:44] needs
[1:28:46] Supply praise the name of our Lord let
[1:28:49] us go to First coronal chapter 28
[1:28:57] 1 chonicles chapter 28 and then we read
[1:29:00] from verse
[1:29:06] 11 praise the name of the Lord the Bible
[1:29:09] says then David gave to Solomon his son
[1:29:12] the pattern of the porch and of the
[1:29:14] houses thereof and of the treasures
[1:29:16] thereof and of the upper chambers
[1:29:18] thereof and of the inner Palace thereof
[1:29:22] and of the place of the M
[1:29:45] SE and the pattern of all that he had by
[1:29:49] the spirit of the Courts of the house of
[1:29:52] the Lord and of all the chambers round
[1:29:55] about and of the treasuries of the house
[1:29:57] of God and of the treasuries of theed
[1:30:18] [Music]
[1:30:20] things
[1:30:29] now God revealed to
[1:30:32] David the way God showed Moses a
[1:30:37] vision of the Tabernacle is going to
[1:30:40] build even here God revealed to David by
[1:30:45] the Holy
[1:30:46] Spirit the temple that he wants them to
[1:30:50] build so now David got the
[1:30:53] pattern and then he wrote it down and
[1:30:57] then he gave it to
[1:30:59] Solomon and then here the Bible says in
[1:31:02] verse 19 all this said
[1:31:06] David the Lord made me to understand in
[1:31:10] writing by his hand upon me even all the
[1:31:13] works of this
[1:31:20] pattern
[1:31:22] so God showed him praise the name of the
[1:31:26] Lord the
[1:31:27] pattern and then he got that pattern and
[1:31:31] then he came and shared it with the
[1:31:33] people like Moses when he got the
[1:31:37] pattern he came and shared it with the
[1:31:40] people we need
[1:31:42] Builders you know like you know like
[1:31:44] different men were anointed to come and
[1:31:48] participate in this
[1:31:50] world praise the name of
[1:31:52] and even now we are building a
[1:31:55] kingdom we need different people to come
[1:31:57] and participate in
[1:31:59] this you need to participate in the
[1:32:02] building of
[1:32:03] the we need to build this Kingdom
[1:32:07] together it's not left to only one
[1:32:10] person praise the name of our Lord and
[1:32:12] don't sayh I believe the other one can
[1:32:15] give me I cannot give no there was that
[1:32:19] widow woman who had only one meal
[1:32:23] left and then the prophet of God went to
[1:32:26] her give me first how about you do you
[1:32:30] esteem the
[1:32:32] other more than yourself or it is first
[1:32:35] my
[1:32:36] need oh first my need first my children
[1:32:41] first my wife first my family first my
[1:32:44] body do you put your need aside and then
[1:32:48] say let the others need
[1:32:50] prevail
[1:32:52] that's what Elijah was telling the
[1:32:54] we give me first and then the Bible says
[1:32:58] when she made the
[1:33:00] meal from where she Drew
[1:33:03] from the oil and the
[1:33:06] wheat they never se you also need to
[1:33:10] have that kind of faith that Lord I'm
[1:33:13] giving my all and believing that you
[1:33:18] repen all that I have need
[1:33:20] of the name of our Lord you know people
[1:33:23] want to
[1:33:24] receive but are you
[1:33:26] giving praise the name of our Lord and
[1:33:29] then the Bible says it is more blessed
[1:33:31] to
[1:33:33] give than to
[1:33:35] receive praise the name of our you know
[1:33:38] in the world God has given us things to
[1:33:40] look
[1:33:41] at this L of
[1:33:44] Victoria it receives water from
[1:33:47] mountains in
[1:33:49] Kenya receives water from
[1:33:53] Rivera now if L
[1:33:56] Victoria was only
[1:33:58] receiving it will be a dead
[1:34:03] Lake but when Lake Victoria
[1:34:06] Rees it gives River takes all the way to
[1:34:11] the mediterian
[1:34:14] Sea you know they are dead legs like we
[1:34:18] have here in Western Uganda then there
[1:34:21] is the Dead
[1:34:23] Sea they just
[1:34:25] receive and there's no life in
[1:34:28] them why do you have why would you want
[1:34:31] to have no life in
[1:34:36] you me give me what are you
[1:34:40] giving you become a dead
[1:34:43] L just on
[1:34:47] receive like Beggars like in London
[1:34:51] there was a beggar who was just
[1:34:55] begging and whatever he would beg he put
[1:34:59] there put there put
[1:35:01] there and when he died when they went to
[1:35:05] his place they got 2
[1:35:10] million what was the use of
[1:35:13] that shouldn't be
[1:35:15] Beggars praise the name of our Lord we
[1:35:17] should do people who
[1:35:20] give praise name of our Lord and so when
[1:35:23] there is a need like there was a need to
[1:35:26] build the temple praise the name of our
[1:35:29] Lord and then
[1:35:31] David he came
[1:35:34] out in second cor first Corin chapter
[1:35:39] 29 and then verse 6 says then the chief
[1:35:43] of the
[1:35:45] fathers and the princes of the tribes of
[1:35:49] Israel and the captains of thousand
[1:35:53] and of hundreds with the rulers of the
[1:35:56] king
[1:35:58] is offered
[1:36:03] willingly they offered
[1:36:06] willingly why they are building the
[1:36:09] Temple together we also need to build
[1:36:12] the temple
[1:36:15] together praise the name of our Lord
[1:36:17] verse seven and gave for the service of
[1:36:20] the house of
[1:36:25] God we need to give for the work of the
[1:36:29] Kingdom support the work of the
[1:36:32] king and then in verse 9 then the people
[1:36:37] rejoiced for that they had offered
[1:36:41] willingly because with a perfect
[1:36:47] heart they offered willingly to the Lord
[1:36:52] and the King also Rejoice with the Great
[1:36:56] Joy praise the name of our Lord they
[1:37:01] offered now if we continue reading here
[1:37:04] the Bible says wherefore David blessed
[1:37:06] the
[1:37:08] Lord and all the
[1:37:11] congregation and said blessed be the
[1:37:15] Lord God of Israel our of our father

[1:45:05] of the
[1:45:07] Lord that his coming is soon at

[1:45:22] want to put every
[1:45:25] effort that we know how to Father the
[1:45:30] kingdom and get the last person saved
[1:45:33] into the
[1:45:37] kingdom and when the last one is
[1:45:40] saved there will not be one
[1:45:44] extra when the last one is brought
[1:45:48] in the body of Christ is
[1:45:51] complete then the Rapture will
[1:45:54] come and we are longing for that praise
[1:45:58] the name of our so what are you doing to

[1:46:59] different Mountains from different
[1:47:02] places praise the name of our Lord and
[1:47:04] it's still the same thing now we need to
[1:47:07] see that we get the last one to
[1:47:10] coming otherwise we can't go in the
[1:47:12] Rapture without the last person
[1:47:15] coming praise the name of our Lord we
[1:47:18] need to participate in building the
[1:47:22] kingdom praise the name of our Lord now
[1:47:25] as I
[1:47:26] finish praise the name of our Lord where
[1:47:29] we
[1:47:30] read the Bible says a stone was
[1:47:34] cut and that stone became a
[1:47:39] kingdom but then you see Daniel chapter
[1:47:42] 2 and then verse
[1:47:44] 30 he says the stone became a great
[1:47:49] mountain and then in Daniel chapter 2
[1:47:52] and then verse 44 he says the
[1:47:56] kingdom of God which can never end took
[1:48:01] over all the
[1:48:03] Earth and now we are part of that
[1:48:07] Kingdom we are the Lively
[1:48:10] Stones building
[1:48:12] up coming to the kingdom we are the
[1:48:16] Lively stones but there are still other
[1:48:18] Stones which are outside
[1:48:20] that we need to bring in now when you
[1:48:23] look in this
[1:48:24] scriptures a
[1:48:26] mountain signifies a
[1:48:30] kingdom praise the name of the Lord it
[1:48:32] says I saw the mountain fill the
[1:48:35] Earth was that a
[1:48:38] kingdom praise the name of the Lord even
[1:48:41] in and then that mountain that Kingdom
[1:48:45] in the millennial of
[1:48:48] Christ and then we see in Revelation
[1:48:51] 21 that the New
[1:48:54] Jerusalem comes down as a
[1:48:58] mountain praise the name of our Lord it
[1:49:00] comes down as a
[1:49:04] mountain praise the name of our Lord let
[1:49:07] us go and
[1:49:09] read in Revelations chapter
[1:49:13] 21 and then verse
[1:49:18] 10 praise the name of our Lord
[1:49:21] Revelation CH
[1:49:24] 21 and then verse
[1:49:27] 10 it
[1:49:29] says and he carried me away in a spirit
[1:49:32] to a great and high mountain and showed
[1:49:35] me the great city the whole Jerusalem
[1:49:38] descending out from
[1:49:49] heaven
[1:49:50] let us jump and go to verse
[1:49:52] 15 and he that talked with me had a
[1:49:56] golden R to measure the city and the g
[1:49:59] thereof and the wall
[1:50:11] thereof and the city lith for square and
[1:50:14] the length is as large as the breth and
[1:50:17] he measure the city with the read
[1:50:21] 12,000 fongs the length and the breed
[1:50:24] and the height of it
[1:50:47] equal now when you look at this 12
[1:50:58] in the message the future home of the
[1:51:00] Heavenly
[1:51:05] bridegroom then he says in paragraph
[1:51:09] 367 now
[1:51:12] notice notice now the Earth is where you
[1:51:17] turn over to the Book of
[1:51:18] Revelation you can see how he measured
[1:51:22] it by the tubit and by
[1:51:28] the so we find out that the city is
[1:51:33] measured and then he says
[1:51:35] 1500
[1:51:43] miles now 1500
[1:51:48] miles 1500 miles is about
[1:51:52] 2,000 1500 2,400 km
[1:52:04] mil so 1500 miles is 1,500 miles 1500
[1:52:12] mil and now
[1:52:14] 1,500
[1:52:17] miles is 2
[1:52:20] 2, 400
[1:52:26] km praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:52:29] when you look at
[1:52:33] this this
[1:52:36] distance you can go to Mombasa and back
[1:52:40] and you have not exhausted
[1:52:45] it but he's talking about the length of
[1:52:49] the city
[1:52:51] and the width of the
[1:52:53] city and so the length of the city and
[1:52:56] the width of the city is equal but even
[1:53:00] the height of the
[1:53:02] city so in other words the city is going
[1:53:04] to be 2,400 km
[1:53:11] high now when you compare with the
[1:53:14] tallest
[1:53:16] mountain Everest mountain is
[1:53:21] only 8.8 km above the sea
[1:53:27] level 8,000 Miles rather 8
[1:53:32] 8,848
[1:53:40] m but then this one here the peak of
[1:53:44] Mount
[1:53:45] Everest ever they can see it 340 km
[1:53:59] TOA is 80
[1:54:02] km then froma to Masa
[1:54:08] is3 so that's about
[1:54:12] 210 then from is
[1:54:17] 130 so now you have about
[1:54:20] maybe 300 something
[1:54:23] K from Ginger but this road is
[1:54:27] Zig but Mount
[1:54:30] Everest you can be here when it is in
[1:54:34] and you seeing the
[1:54:37] top but yet Mount Everest is only 8.8 km
[1:54:42] above the sea
[1:54:47] level Kil Kil
[1:54:51] but then this
[1:54:53] mountain is
[1:54:55] 2,000 400
[1:55:00] km so you see no wonder the Bible says
[1:55:05] there will be no
[1:55:06] son because the lamb who will be on top
[1:55:10] of that City will be the son of the
[1:55:12] whole
[1:55:13] world praise the name of our Lord so now
[1:55:16] in that message he says in paragraph
[1:55:21] 368 you know how far that would
[1:55:24] reach I measured it off this week it
[1:55:28] would reach from May to
[1:55:31] Florida and from Eastern SEO to 600
[1:55:34] miles
[1:55:44] apart West of
[1:55:48] Mississippi so now
[1:55:50] when you like let us look at what's here
[1:55:54] if you
[1:55:56] measure praise the name you know there
[1:55:59] is two Dimension and three
[1:56:04] dimension like a two Dimension is like
[1:56:08] this X and
[1:56:11] Y length
[1:56:15] width and when you take that
[1:56:18] area of 2 *
[1:56:24] 2,400 you get about
[1:56:27] 5.7 5.76 million square
[1:56:33] km
[1:56:37] 5.7 and that is the
[1:56:40] size of the East African
[1:56:43] countries E Africa you bring Kenya
[1:56:46] Uganda UGA Tanzania Randa
[1:56:50] South Sudan democra of Cong and Somalia
[1:56:56] all that big
[1:56:57] area if you measure in the two
[1:57:00] Dimension but this city is
[1:57:02] threedimensional
[1:57:03] it has this side this side and then
[1:57:08] up now that is more surface
[1:57:12] area it increases the surface
[1:57:17] area and so now in that message
[1:57:20] paragraph
[1:57:22] 370 and the bread and the height are the
[1:57:27] same that would make it 1500 miles this
[1:57:35] way and then 1500 mil that
[1:57:38] way and then 1500 miles by the
[1:57:43] height think of it transparent
[1:57:48] gold and the city had a wall around
[1:57:53] it now paragraph
[1:57:56] 371 then he says there is another
[1:57:59] geographical
[1:58:01] measure that the dimensions are the
[1:58:06] same because on top of the
[1:58:08] city the lamb was the light then he said
[1:58:12] that that
[1:58:14] geographical that kind of geometrical
[1:58:18] polygon
[1:58:20] is a
[1:58:21] pyramid a Four
[1:58:23] Square in paragraph
[1:58:27] 449 he says now you have got the
[1:58:32] city see it is a ho
[1:58:37] Mountain because Geographic we don't
[1:58:39] have a pyramid which natur we don't have
[1:58:43] a natural
[1:58:48] pyramid it's the pyramids which were
[1:58:50] made in Egypt by man but the pyramid is
[1:58:55] a depiction of a
[1:59:01] mountain so now you see here that the
[1:59:04] New
[1:59:05] Jerusalem is a
[1:59:07] mountain the New Jerusalem is a
[1:59:11] kingdom praise the name of so now what
[1:59:14] we are doing now we are building that
[1:59:18] Kingdom praise the name of the Lord and
[1:59:21] if you are part of the New Jerusalem you
[1:59:23] should also
[1:59:25] participate in the construction of
[1:59:27] Jerusalem by bringing new members in
[1:59:32] B let us build the kingdom
[1:59:35] together praise the name of our Lord let
[1:59:37] us
[1:59:39] participate praise the name of our Lord
[1:59:41] the Bible says John saw the city coming
[1:59:45] down from heaven as a bride prepared for
[1:59:49] the
[1:59:50] husband a city cannot be there without
[1:59:55] people praise the name of our Lord and
[1:59:58] we are the people that make that City we
[2:00:02] are the people that make that
[2:00:04] Kingdom but as you have got in there's
[2:00:08] somebody still outside that needs to get
[2:00:10] in we need to participate together to
[2:00:14] build the
[2:00:15] kingdom as I finish now Revelations 21
[2:00:18] and vers

[2:00:24] new
[2:00:26] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[2:00:29] Earth we passed away and there was no
[2:00:33] Mery and John saw the ho
[2:00:37] City the New
[2:00:40] Jerusalem coming down from
[2:00:43] God out of Heaven prepared as a bride
[2:00:47] for her husband
[2:00:50] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[2:00:53] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[2:00:57] with men and he shall dwell with them
[2:01:00] and he shall be his people and God
[2:01:05] himself shall be their God praise the
