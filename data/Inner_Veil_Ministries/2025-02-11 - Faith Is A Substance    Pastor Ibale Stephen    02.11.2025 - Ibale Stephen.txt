Whenever I'm not here, I'm somewhere trying the best to do to serve the Lord. So, it's uh the grace of God for us to be back together again. Amen. Amen. And trusting that this grace may speak to us. We want to appreciate the great things that God has been doing especially amongst us. We thank God for sister Mary. Amen. She never misses service. She was just out of surgery the other day and she's here today. Amen. Amen. That's total commitment. Cancer and I trust that the Lord has prepared a healing for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. that you walk out here and testify of the grace of God.

Patience &gt;&gt; but I just cannot recollect. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know there are many kids that come through and some many people come to be baptized. But it's a blessing. Amen. when they hold her &gt;&gt; and we are happy to see sister patience patience. &gt;&gt; Amen. That she's holding. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just do one thing for me this morning for me as I talk to you. Amen. Amen. Sometimes I preach, sometimes I teach, &gt;&gt; but sometimes I encourage. And I feel the way I need to come this morning is to encourage the church that one of these days we shall behold and for every troubles we have along the way. God has prepared a solution and it's only your faith that can bring the solution down. Amen. How many of you have faith today? I do. If I don't have faith, I wouldn't be here. Faith brought me in. Faith will keep me in. faith will take me to the end of the journey. Amen. We thank God for perfect faith upon which our salvation is found. Amen. Faith is our foundation. So we thank God for the pastor. Amen. And the labors of service. May the Lord bless you. As a pastor, he has a responsibility to pastor the people. And you know to pastor, you have to go certain directions. Amen. So when you listen to me, you are not listening to the pastor. I'm totally different cut. Amen. But all together is one ministry, the ministry of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just stand up and get into a scripture reading. Amen. He that cometh to him must believe that is he and is the reward of those that diligently seek him. And this morning we've got diligent seekers before his presence. Are you seeking diligently this morning? And may the Lord reward you. Amen. God bless you, brother Mut. I think he drives the longest to be in church and is always very persistent. Amen. The Lord bless him so much. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 and verse one. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have got any today is a solution in glory. Amen. Amen. You see that deep cause to the deep. You can't be crying before the Lord without an answer being somewhere. Amen. Amen. It would break the laws of faith because faith is the substance of things that we are patiently waiting for. Amen. Amen. So, Hebrews chapter 11 and verse one. But let us have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we want to give thanks to you this morning because your grace has brought us into your presence. We thank you for the doorway of the blood that washes us clean. And father, when we get before your presence, you just keep looking at us through the blood. Thank you for the perfection of grace that you have given to us. And it's that by which we come. And we pray that you may speak to us this morning as you speak to son, as you speak to your children with grace and favor, father that you may make everything work the way you said it will. We bring the needs Lord at the foot of the cross trusting heavenly father that when we walk out of here will be a testimony in our lives in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Verse one of Hebrews 11. Now, not tomorrow, not yesterday, but now. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Now. &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance of things hoped for. The evidence of things not seen. May the Lord add blessing the reading of his word. You may be seated. So I want to speak on the subject of substance. Substance and you know substance is an evidence. This is substance and is an evidence. Amen. Amen. So substance is a very interesting subject and I pray that the Lord may pour revelation and understanding not for only this service but for our journey all the way into eternity. Now substance means that which has actual existence. And Paul says as long as his substance it's an evidence. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It means we are dealing with something. Something that you somehow heard before. And therefore you're looking for substance. And once you get that substance, it's the evidence that you have what you've been hoping for. Amen. So substance actually is the existence of something and hope in this particular scripture is not maybe or may not be because in the human language hope is maybe and hope may also being may not be but in the divine language hope is just the patience that you have invested in waiting for the promise because the promise is there is an evidence. Are you together with me? It's a substance. So people pray and they think what they are praying for as long as they in the will of God. But yet at the same time they are not sure whether what they are praying for will come or will not come. Faith says it will come. Amen. Amen. So faith brings into existence the things that were ordained along our life's journey. As long as God ordained you and elected you as a son of God, there are certain things along the junctions of time that God has ordained for you to pull down to support you along that journey. Are you together with me? That's why we pray because faith prepared an answer for you. Amen. When the children of Israel pray and they were suffering in Egypt, God in his predestinated plan had planned a Moses. So Moses just come into existence. is the answer to the prayers of the children of God. So your path, your earthly path was seen of God and you came into the path of life to be tried in certain areas of your life. The prophet says we come from the attribute into the flesh to be tested. Are you together with me? Yes. That's why we come into this flesh. We come from the attribute into this flesh to be tried. And when we overcome, we get back home. But we were not brought here to be tried and fail. We were brought here to be tried and perfected by those trials. For as we go through trials, THERE WILL BE some cry. And as you cry, there will be answers that will be dropping from eternity to support YOU ALONG YOUR LIFESPAN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Without which we would never make it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But God has prepared and has ordained answers to your prayer. As long as you pull. Amen. And you are pulling simply BECAUSE that's the only WAY YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT. God will not hide himself away from you. FAITH is a substance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis &gt;&gt; and try to use Genesis chapter 15 and verse 13 to understand what I'm talking about. The scripture said, "And he said unto Abraham, This is God now. He's talking to Abraham. He's not talking to Abraham. He's talking to Abraham. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Before his change of the body come. Amen. He's talking to a man whose change was coming on but had not come yet. And he says, "Know of assured that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that's not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall affect them for afflict them 400 years. And also that nation whom they shall serve will lie judge. and afterward they shall come with great substance. &gt;&gt; Amen. As I said, God [screaming] is talking to Abraham. This man here does not have the seed that he expects to have because God had promised a child. God is speaking about gratitude. Amen. Meaning that the sun was a substance that was somehow somewhere which was only waiting for time. That substance are you together with me? So faith is the substance. FAITH OF ABRAHAM WAS A SUBSTANCE that was in AN substance was a son and he was called Isaac. And when the season came because with faith you have to wait FOR THE SUBSTANCE TO COME DOWN. I thought somebody would say I love that. Amen. So now God here to Abraham is mapping his path and that of his seed after him. God was a substance. JACOB WAS A SUBSTANCE. THE PATRIARCHS were substance of the patriarch. They existed in a realm and now Abraham needed just to wait. Faith &gt;&gt; is the substance of things TO FALL. AND THEREFORE BY FAITH Abraham praise the Lord. to the path who is being prepared and he's speaking to Abraham not about me but he's speaking to him about substance and he's talking him about distance of time substance of things HOPED FOR [screaming] THEY exist in a rim and time brings them at the right time. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is mapping out this path and that of the seed after him to the path through Isaac, Jacob, and then through the 12 pat that made the nation of Israel. So God is looking at them 400 years of trial till they come back again to Canaan and God sees their seasons and God sees their trials. Amen. Sometimes we get into situations and you begin to think like God does not care. But God cares for every step of your life. And when the time comes for you to cry, THE SUBSTANCE COMES BACK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. God works with Jesus. Amen. So they developed faith. Amen. So God mapped out what they needed in answer to their trial during the 400 years of captivity. Amen. That answer was waiting looming somewhere. Let me tell you and the ANSWER TO THE CRYO OF THE children of Israel was going to work by Moses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So Moses could not come 200 years before. He had come directly at the right spot because he was going to be the answer to the prayers of the people. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sometimes you think you're desperate as long as you are a child of God. Brother say your path has been MARKED AND THE TIME YOU CRY HAS BEEN WAITING. It's the substance. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, praise God. We just need to trust that God cared for us even before the foundation of THE WORLD. HE KNEW WHEN YOU CRY FOR school and he made sure that when you cry it will come. HE KNEW WHEN YOU CRY FOR YOUR RENT AND WHEN YOU CRY GOD WILL ALWAYS put our faith. Faith is a substance. Amen. If it's NOT SUBSTANCE THEN OUR FAITH would fail. Amen. They devolved faith for what God had already reserved for them in eternity. Amen. Come in the right season. So he saw their path and revealed it to Abraham. He says,"Abraham, come here. I'm going to show you the substance that's waiting up yonder. Amen. He says your sin will be taken by a strange people in captivity 400 years. After that I'm going to bring them out with a mighty heart. Abraham would ask my seed I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN. BUT THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM WERE UNSEEN SUBSTANCE. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. And along the way as you go in your life's journey blessing now may not be visible, but it is a service in an invisible real. WHEN THE SEASON COMES AND YOU PRAY, GOD BEGINS to remen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; On the same token, listen. God had given Joseph the preview of his life. And when Joseph entered his trials, he knew the trials were not the end of his life. [laughter] He said, you know, the ships will bow, the stars will bow, the moon, the sun. Amen. And you know, I mean, Jesus knew &gt;&gt; that that glory was only awaiting substantial. Are you together with him? &gt;&gt; He knew that the GLORY WHERE HIS brothers bow WHERE THE SON BOWS, HIS father It's just a matter of time. So faith in that area was a substance that Joseph HAD TO PATIENTLY WAIT FOR. AMEN. There are certain things that have been given to us in scripture. And when you study the scripture, you realize the promises of God to you as substance. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. So now Joseph, he kept calling for his deliverance to come, &gt;&gt; but in season he went in the pit with a vision. He was sought to the Israelite, and he went, &gt;&gt; but with a vision, he became a slave in the house of Portifer, &gt;&gt; but with a vision. He went to prison but with a vision. Hallelujah. The vision always stood before him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let the vision of the GLORY OF GOD ALWAYS STAND BEFORE YOU. Let the vision of your adoption before you. Trials will come. Keep that vision alive. You may go DOWN IN THE PIT. KEEP THAT VISION ALIVE. You may stumble somewhere. KEEP THAT VISION. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. BUT WHEN YOU FALL BACK, the vision is NOT THERE CALLED AS A SON of God. PERFECTION IS A SUBSTANCE. And you say Lord, &gt;&gt; it's a matter of season overcome this condition. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's go to Psalms here. And every form of deliverance he needed was hidden as by God as a substance that needed to be revealed in season. Brother Joshua, you may cry sometimes just because the season has not come here yet. [laughter] Sister Beatrice, &gt;&gt; you may cry sometimes because the season has not come. YOUR FAITH IS A SUBSTANCE is not your mental attitude but is a substance. that would only come in existence because the season is right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Psalms 105 and verse 17. The Holy Spirit says, "He sent a man before them, even Joseph who was sold for a servant. HE SENT A MAN BEFORE THEM. And this man was sold as a slave, but he was PART OF THE PLAN OF GOD. What are you going through? DON'T C YOUR BROTHER. DON'T C YOUR BROTHER. DON'T C YOUR sister because they are responsible for what you are going through. No, IT WAS NOT HIS PARENTS. They were responsible. God used THEM ahead of substance. Hallelujah. Thus they would need WHEN THE TIME FOR CRYING COMES. HE HAD TO SEND JOSEPH AHEAD OF HIM. HE WAS PART OF THE GREATER vast that had come to Abraham. And now Joseph he wonders how he fix it. But then all the time HE HAS TO HOLD THE VISION THAT VISION SUBSTANTIAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So he says verse eight in whose feet they hurt with fetters. He was laid in iron until the time that his word came. THE WORD OF THE LORD TRIED IT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. WHATEVER YOU ARE GOING THROUGH, THE word allows you to be tried until the word of the Lord comes to your substance. &gt;&gt; You may spend sleepless nights. But that's part of the journey. Keep holding the faith alive. Never allow the situation you go through. Ever try to change your attitude about your breath. Because if you are a CHILD OF GOD, ALL things work together for good. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU EVER TURN YOUR MAN AGAINST your brother. I wouldn't be suffering if it were not for my brethren. They sold me to Joseph. Now I mean the fetas and the fetas are hurting that it required that to prepare the substance ahead of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes, &gt;&gt; you know, we are so quick to say things about people and think that maybe if it were not for so and so, I would do not been in such such a situation. God allowed that to reveal his blessing ahead of time. Joseph's path was seen and described in dreams. He goes to his brethren, I had a dream and then he goes there another time yet another dream and yet another dream. So under the same token, the path of an elect is MARKED ALONG YOUR PATH JOURNEY. And all that was ordained for you is in store as substance. We are NOT GOING TO PASS the same journey. Much as the destination is the same, the trials will not be the same and the blessings will not be the same. Are you together with me? GOD HIMSELF WHO PREPARED YOUR PATH. HE KNOWS at what junction he needs to come down. and be able to hold your hand. Amen. By providing THE ANSWER IN YOUR PRAYER. When Israel cried, he told Moses, "I have heard and I have seen I AM COME DOWN, BUT you are the hand of Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; And by grace God has led predestinated faith which can reach out and possess your inheritance and all that you need to empower you along your calling. Never think that you get to a point and you in a stuck situation and there's no answer. There will always be an answer. &gt;&gt; This journey here is not your labor. It's a predestinated journey. God knows how you are going to go and the situation that you are suffering from now. He knows. BUT HOW DOES he bring the answer? YOUR FAITH WHILE YOU'RE CRYING in that situation becomes the creative anointing to bring down an answer for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to what brother Brham says in the adoption message part three. Listen here we begin to come. See predestinated us to our inheritance in him which was predestinated to us. WE INHERITED IT BEFORE THE foundation of the world for his own purpose. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For his own what for his own purpose to work out his own good will to be a God savior. Amen. Amen. Which means &gt;&gt; we did not come here &gt;&gt; as products of cano union. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, Adam was a creation. Adam, Eve was a creation because they come from God. &gt;&gt; But Cain &gt;&gt; was a product of a car union in him. There was no seed of God. Therefore, he didn't come from God. His path did not have a predestinated journey. at you as a seed of God. Who has got A SEED OF GOD IN YOU predestinated &gt;&gt; to SUCH AN EXTENT THAT you come to inherit your I mean to to inherit your adoption. Your adoption was NOT PREPARED WHEN YOU COME INTO THE FLESH, BUT IT WAS ORDAINED OF GOD. THEREFORE, WHEN YOU COME, IT EXISTS. YOU COME TO POSSESS those possessions. AMEN. AND BECAUSE YOU ARE ADOPTED CHILD OF GOD AND you are you are an elected child of God, there is something in you which cries above. When you seem like you ARE IN THE DARK spot and you HAVE COME TO A JUNCTION and you don't know where to go, THERE IS SOMETHING in you that has always cried. &gt;&gt; The rest of the world know. But you as A CHILD OF GOD, YOU know when you are lost, you know when you've lost your path AND YOU BEGIN TO CRY AND YOU SAY, "ABA, FATHER." AND EACH TIME YOU CRY, A VOICE COMES FROM HEAVEN AND SAYS, "THIS IS THE WAY. WALK YE IN IT." THERE ARE SO MANY times when you seem to have lost your path and you lose your peace. You don't have joy. YOU KEEP CRYING AND THEN SOMEHOW a voice comes and speaks to you. Do this AND YOU TURN YOU BEGIN TO walk right. WHEN THE JOY COMES BACK, THE PEACE COMES BACK. God for his children has ordained particular positions. Amen. Where they ARE GOING TO CALL CERTAIN answers to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I tell you God is good. Let us deal with substance a little bit. You see along the pilgrim journey of the church, God allowed the shadows to declare the existence of substance. Have you heard that? that along the prim journey of the church, God allowed church to declare the presence of substance and faith gives you the confidence TO PULL DOWN THE substance along. ong your life's journey. That's why FAITH NEVER FAILS to deliver because it's dealing with substance. THAT'S WHY FAITH NEVER FAILS BECAUSE IT'S NOT DEALING WITH myth is dealing with substance and that FAITH HAS GOT ENOUGH POWER to create that substance. Yes. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; What did he say? &gt;&gt; Faith is not Faith is not an evidence only. Uhuh. Faith is not [laughter] faith is not online evidence. It is a substance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So faith &gt;&gt; is not only an evidence. Yeah. Yeah. Faith faith will say faith is also a substance. Faith itself is a substance. evidence of things that the senses of the body won't declare. Your senses will not touch it, but it's there. Your eyes will not see it, but it's there. I'll take you to this message of faith in God. HE SAYS NOW SOME think that it's an emot I mean a mental conception of the word but that's not right is a substance I want you to mention that faith is I want to hear That &gt;&gt; faith is a substance. &gt;&gt; Faith is a substance. &gt;&gt; Faith is not a myth. Faith is a substance of things hoped for. [screaming] Meaning that it's a substance that you are only patiently waiting to achieve. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He says to have an evidence. It must be a substance. So it's NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT you imagine in your mind. It is something that absolutely You HAVE [laughter] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You have it. &gt;&gt; But momentarily, &gt;&gt; it's being held by the heavenly bank. Okay. So, is something that you possess in your own being and what is it? It's the evidence of THINGS &gt;&gt; THAT YOU have hoped for. &gt;&gt; It's the evidence of things you do not have as yet, but you have the authority of God to say that you have it. Amen. It's an evidence something you have in your heart. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Faith is a substance. &gt;&gt; The reason why something in you gives you confidence as you pray is because your answer is a substance. It's only going to come in the right time. &gt;&gt; So let me put a powerful statement here that the God who created you predestinated for a certain path. He also saw the challenges along the way and fitted you with enough faith. to speak solutions along the way. IF YOU CAN SETTLE THIS MOUNTAIN, you have mountains along THE WAY. IF YOU SAY TO THIS MOUTH, not that the pastor says it for you, but if you say, you've got creative anointing. Amen. And we CALL IT FAITH. Faith is a creative power. So we are not dealing with the shadows. When we deal with faith, we are not dealing with shadows. We are dealing with the substance. We are not dealing with shadows of Christ. But we are dealing with the substance Christ himself, the person of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because in the Old Testament, WE'VE GOT SHADOWS THAT SPOKE OF. We've got the lamb. We've got the feast. &gt;&gt; We've got THE SACRIFICES. ALL those things were shadows. But thank God that faith has brought the article himself down to us. Amen. We are not dealing with shadows. We are dealing with the person of the Lord JESUS CHRIST who got a creative power and a creative anointing that sits on the inside of your heart. We are not dealing with the chemistry of the blood but the life himself. Are you together with me? I'm trying TO TAKE AWAY THAT MENTALITY, that faith is what you just think and then you pray for. Okay, let us talk about the Old Testament shadows. Let's go to Hebrews chapter 10 and verse one. &gt;&gt; For the law, having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year make the overcome as they run to perfect says the law was a shadow of things of circumstances. that existed in the divine dimension, but then with time they would be released into manifestation. So the New Testament is those shadows putting on flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to pick me very well here. CHRIST THE SHADOW, for example, stepped forth from the shadows and John recognized him throughout the Old Testament. He was hiding in a shadow of a lamp. But then when it come to reality, John says, "Behold the lamb of God that take away the sins of God." So Christ in the shadows of atonement, stepped forth on Calvary, and died for our sins once for all. And today is the propation of our sins. SO A SHADOW COMES forth because light light is striking on an object somewhere. So the light would BE HITTING ON THE OBJECT IS HITTING ON THE SUBSTANCE. AND BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT ON THE SUBSTANCE, it sets down a shadow. So a shadow just you know declares THAT THERE IS SUBSTANCE which is existing somewhere. &gt;&gt; If you are in the house alone, Maybe like this church, we have a big compound and when you are here alone, maybe you are studying or praying and then you see a shadow of a tall big man. You don't expect to see a snake crawling. It's a man and you need to be worried. Who is this? Is it a brother? Is a shadow is declaring a coming object? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So in the mind of God, listen, Christ existed and so the light of revelation released these shadows as a lamp. And in the days of atonement, it was the lamb, the lamb, the lamb. a shadow. But when the New Testament came when the season had come AFTER THE FULLNESS OF TIME, the shadow produced the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Meaning that this Lord Jesus CHRIST existing somewhere. was just released because the season had come. &gt;&gt; There is something I want to bring out here. &gt;&gt; I want to go with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. In first Peter chapter one and verse 19. This is what Peter says. But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. Who very WAS FORAINED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you. HE WAS EXISTING IN THE MIND OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. That the fullness of TIME came from the mind. Amen. TO THE MANIFESTATION. BUT FIRST OF ALL, IT HAS BEEN declared by the shadows that pertain to WHO CHRIST IS. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE WAS ORDAINED IN THE MIND of God come forth in this season. So faith, PRAISE GOD, deals with a spiritual substance that exist a substance in the mind of God AND FACE THE SUBSTANCES into the natural real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. AND GOD BLESSED YOU HERE. You come from his mind so that you can be ABLE TO OVERCOME THAT ALONG YOUR JOURNEY. HE SAW THE CHALLENGES. AMEN. HE SAW THE CHALLENGE of Elijah and he prepared the window woman. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. WITH A LITTLE FLOUR AND A LITTLE OIL. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. TO ELIJAH. GO TO CERTAIN SUCH A PLACE. FIND A window woman to your prayer. Faith is a substance. [laughter] Faith therefore has creative power. Let me show you here in the same Jesus tonight. &gt;&gt; Jesus of Nazareth, &gt;&gt; send forth thy spirit tonight. &gt;&gt; Thy creating spirit and thy great presence to drive back the darkness of the enemy. And may ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE A CREATIVE power in their hearts tonight. The power of faith &gt;&gt; creative. Praise God. It brings things from the shadows into reality in the real pull THINGS substance from the mind of God so that THOSE THINGS CAN PUT ON them in flesh. &gt;&gt; It is a creative power, &gt;&gt; creative anointing. Just like Moses existed in the mind of God, BUT THE CRY OF THE [screaming] PEOPLE BROUGHT HIM DOWN. NOT IN THE FIRST 100 YEARS. Not in THE NEXT 200 YEARS. BUT IN THE right season. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Still in the needs of the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet says, &gt;&gt; "So was Christ for or dead before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you in the fullness of time." Are you praying over something in the fullness of time? God will never desert his elect. &gt;&gt; He has given you creative anointing called faith. You pull the substance of deliverance and it comes. It takes When the season is right, &gt;&gt; faith creates the answers. &gt;&gt; You'll be able to create your job at the right time. You can be able to create opportunities. None of that which was ordained for you along your life's journey that will ever come to not. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So you just keep in prayer EVERY TIME YOUR SITUATION this is what I am. He knows what he's going to do. HE WILL TELL YOU SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE. There is the widow woman. Hallelujah. WITH SOME OIL AND SOME I mean fl. But the problem is we always adise God in prayer. [laughter] That's why it doesn't work. Let me take you into this quote. &gt;&gt; He says, "Where was Jesus lard &gt;&gt; at Calvary?" And he says, "No, sir." &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; was slain before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO HE WAS A SUBSTANCE. FOR THE CRY OF the sinner. &gt;&gt; THE SUBSTANCE WAS THERE. &gt;&gt; It was waiting FOR THE CRY of the sinner. He says, "Behold the lamb of God that was slain before the foundation OF THE WORLD. GOD IN THE BEGINNING WHEN he saw the scene, he saw that what would happen. He spoke the word and Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world. And every person who was saved was saved. According to the Bible, when the lamb was slain, the mind of Christ, [screaming] &gt;&gt; so the lamb was already a substance before the foundation of God. The prophet says, you included in salvation then. Hallelujah. In the mind of God, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO THE ALTAR, YOU ARE SAYING LORD FORGIVE ME. You just come into real life and you are creating THE BLOOD OF GOD UPON YOURSELF BY FAITH. THE BLOOD BEGINS TO flow upon you included in the salvation of God. Faith is a substance of things hoped. God has arranged your path of life much as it's not put on paper like that of Israel. Oh, you'll have a seed. They'll be in a foreign land, but then I'll come down deliver them. Yeah, that was put on paper for you to resource faith. But that's the way God deals with his children. He maps their journey. Let me tell you another thing. And he puts an angel by their side to walk this journey. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will never walk alone. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was an elect came to an inheritance that was already ordained for you. You have seen that &gt;&gt; you know God told Abraham the mind of God about Israel. Their deliverance substance in the mind of God and the I mean the coming of Moses brought that mind. into manifestation. &gt;&gt; And God makes it so dramatic. It goes for so many years. First Abraham goes years without a child. Then the child was born and then it was played out. Amen. Like Abraham would slay his son. Amen. And God would say no. Then comes Jacob and then the patriarch substance was building up. The nation then would go into strange land. Amen. And when Jacob was aging and then blessing his children, he demanded that when he's gone on, &gt;&gt; they should not leave his bones in a strange land. They'll go with those bones. He was reminding his there is a deliverer that was coming on. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Joshua. Amen. &gt;&gt; What you think to be the end of your life is just God building the narrative of your testimony. Amen. Six years God is building the narrative. Amen. Of sister Mary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you'll meet her, there are no SIGNS OF CANCER. God has sustained her. SOMEHOW SOMEWHERE PULLING DOWN her some. Amen. And in the right season, faith is going to bring the substance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you are faithful and falls into line of your calling already exists in the eternal dimensions of substance. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to talk here about fellowship. What we call divine fellowship. You know it's not holy to come into this fellowship late. You need to come in good time and build the temple. Not the temple. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come and be part of the worship. Let the Lord open up your mind with the Sunday school and that when the minister comes here, you already in. You see, sometimes when we come to church here, we treat it as a religious, &gt;&gt; but it's more than that. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that you are in fellowship here this morning because you've always been. Are you together with me? You've always been part of that eternal fellowship. And if you've been part of that eternal fellowship, then you are going to be a manifestation of that eternal fellowship here on earth. Nobody will come and tell you come let us go and worship together. Nobody, &gt;&gt; you know, there is something in there that is calling and bringing you together into the economy of God in a local area. Are you together with me? Yeah, that's what is happening. If you are not part of the economy of God, there is nothing that can pull you. to worship &gt;&gt; together with the saint. &gt;&gt; But there is something here that calls you to be part of the worship service. If you're PART OF THE LOCAL BODY, AMEN. You don't feel comfortable if this hand here has been broken off. It will keep jumping up and down because it's looking for the body. Amen. You see people out there, they begin to jump up and down because they are looking for the body. Amen. Some of them, they got to this place. They got to that place. But God saw you as a part of this assembly here. [applause] And you NEED TO BE PART of it. Amen. BE A MANIFESTATION THAT WHEN THE ROLL call is called, I'LL BE GATHERED TOGETHER WITH MY PEOPLE. We are your kind of people. WHY do you keep away? Amen. Praise the Lord. The situations you GO THROUGH IN TIME DO not and should not change this reality the situations you go through. They should not and they must NOT change this understanding that you from the beginning. You were part of this gathering and fellowship which eternal &gt;&gt; eternal fellowship with God. The situations you go through sometimes moments of turmoil They shouldn't take away the narrative. They shouldn't take away the story that I am A CHILD OF GOD. I AM PART [screaming] OF GOD. WE ALWAYS BE PART of God. Amen. You see, Job was shaken in HIS FAITH. AND GOD CAME down to reveal to Job THAT JOB LISTENED. YOU WERE PART OF AN ETERNAL FELLOWSHIP. YOU ARE PART OF A HEAVENLY SUBSTANCE. REGARDLESS OF THE TRIALS YOU ARE GOING THROUGH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. There are some PEOPLE THEY STEP BACK a little bit when THEY GET SOME KIND OF CHALLENGES. When they lose their job, when they've GOT MARITAL PROBLEMS, when they get SOME TROUBLE, STEP BACK. But let me tell you, THE MORE TROUBLES YOU HAVE, the closer to God you should be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Tell the devil I will not be like a cave. When you are trouble, you walked away from the presence of the trouble you have the son OF GOD WHERE YOU CAN find the suffering. Hallelujah. BECAUSE YOUR ANSWER TO THE CHALLENGES IS ALREADY THERE in eternity. YOU KNOW YOUR FAITH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD COME HERE. Faith the church. Amen. Yes, sir. God told Job, you shouldn't be shaken by your trials. Because you came from the attribute. Amen. To be tested. Hey, that's what Malachi 4 told us. You come from the mind of God. come here in the flesh to be tested. So when you are tested, you need to come AROUND HERE SO THAT you can have a shoulder to lean on together so that YOU CAN CALL THE substance of God come down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to fellowship here. fellowship with God through reconciliation. The prophet says when we get over this little shadow that we are passing through THIS HERE IS JUST a little shadow we are passing through. The reality is that it WILL TAKE SOME TIME 70 years going through this shadow. Oh, praise God. Amen. So when WE GET OVER THIS LITTLE shadow that we are passing through now called the earth journey and we arrive on the other side then it will be an eternal fellowship. When this little type this little type type that we we have here merges into eternity when time and eternity merges together. So the trials that we are going through should not blacken our minds when we are in Christ. PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; ALL THIS temporal joys, they should not blacken, the revelation of who you are here on earth. You are a shadow. [laughter] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE JUST A SHADOW. AND SO GOD HAD TO REMIND JOHN that John the earth here is not your destination. WE ARE ETERNAL beings going through an earthly experience. That's who we are. Yes. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; he's defining Job to himself. &gt;&gt; Job 38 verse4. He's asking Job. Job is in pain. His body is popping out maggots. the earthworms. &gt;&gt; You know, he has got a a portion and he's trying to scratch his body and God is not coming to Job and say sorry Jobhu no. He's telling him, "Cut yourself that I talk to you like a man." That's the problem. &gt;&gt; We need to be sympathized with you know, I lost, you know, my back has been this I don't come to church because of this. the principles of God. An elect rugged in his faith. Rugged. You know, you know, you don't have to start saying, "Oh, now Elijah I need a double portion of your anointing. Don't let me go back and say to my people by Elijah will just tell you right you go back if you're not ready. He's not going to beg the seven go away. And when the 12 are saying Jesus, will you also go away? You should know God from that angle. That God does not beg and elect and the elect never falls away because of situation. SO GOD IS NOT BEGGING JOB. He's trying to make him UNDERSTAND JOB. You cannot be advising me OF HOW I SHOULD DEAL WITH IT. Are you together with me? WE DON'T ADVISE God of how he has to deal with it BECAUSE THE PATH HAS BEEN set on THE PATH OF JOB. HE WAS GOING TO GO through those trials. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY brothers have never been the way I've been. pass and keep calling the substance. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He is trying to tell Jo. Amen. Do you have a better understanding than me? I'll ask you a few questions. Well, you know, where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Well declare if thou has understanding to begin with job you don't have a supernatural clarity of who you ARE I can only release you a little bit as a shadow. So these realities ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN BE PULLED DOWN BY FAITH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. We come to verse five. Who has laid the bur thereof? If thou knowest, oh who thou who has stretched the the line upon it, whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened. Or who laid the cornerstone there. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When the morning stars together and all the sons of God shouted for joy, you lost that memory. BUT YOU ARE PART OF THAT ECONOMY. HALLELUJAH. But you must know FROM UP THERE. YOU BYPASS YOUR come down to the bottom to be tested. Are you going through trials? &gt;&gt; YES. YOU CAME here &gt;&gt; to be tested and your FAITH MUST BE RUGGED. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. PULL THE SUBSTANCE that will deliver you from that condition AND BRING YOU TO YOUR STATE OF PERFECTION. So you are not here as a VISITOR THAT you came to church to visit for 5 years and then you go away. You are here because you've always been part of the economy of God. And even when YOU CAME INTO YOUR SHADOW HERE, HALLELUJAH, you cannot break that fellowship. Amen. You must always look for your kind of people. Amen. not go to the volleyballs or soccer where there is fellowship here. You are coming here because it's an eternal fellowship. Hallelujah. IT'S ETERNAL TOGETHER in heaven. AMEN. A SUBSTANCE AND WE ARE NOW HERE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE COME ASH BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE SUBSTANCE WHERE we came from. Amen. So these fellowships we enjoy now are not car gatherings. We are in the presence of the living God. If only you can be able to understand. You have not come here to gather body to body. You have come here to fellowship SEED TO SEED THAT WHO CAME FROM GOD HAVING FELLOWSHIP and that came from God and THAT OUR FELLOWSHIP IS NOT ENDING HERE. THAT IT DID NOT START FROM HERE. IT CAME FROM HEAVEN. WE CAME ON THE EARTH TO BE TESTED TOGETHER. COME TOGETHER and go back home together. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we don't assemble around an imaginary God. is here with the same power and authority. God is real substance. Can you believe that? Now it can break all your chains. Yes, it can. &gt;&gt; Because Hebrews 11:6, &gt;&gt; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is. He's a susest God and that is a rewarder of them that diligently seek. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you in the presence of the substance not an imagination? He is a rewarder. He is a rewarder. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the reality. Each time we come together in person, he is present. &gt;&gt; Where two or three are gathered together, he's present. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh let's track this eternal fellowship a little bit. You see this earth is simply because it was spoken into existence. &gt;&gt; And God had this earth in his mind and spoken. Let there be. Amen. I am because I'm part of God's eternal mind. And you also you are a part of God's eternal mind. So we don't come here to meet one another. We come here because we have met before. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE HAVE MET BEFORE, BROTHER. We were part of God. And when we come down here, we have an eternal fellowship. It is not starting here. It started in eternal. So how can you walk away from it? Where can we go? Because this is the word of eternal life. You were made to fellowship with God and therefore with one another. We come from God to fellowship with God. And therefore with one another because we both came from God. We are all drawn to God in fellowship because we come from the same source. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Brother Brham said, &gt;&gt; "But to really come into fellowship with God means to accept the blood." Have you accepted the blood? But to REALLY COME INTO FELLOWSHIP with God means to accept the blood is it is being applied to your heart by the baptism of the Holy Spirit by a new birth. Then you become a son &gt;&gt; and in relationship back with God again. It means you have come to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy in the time of need. that your sins, &gt;&gt; your sins may be constantly cleansed because you are under the blood. &gt;&gt; You have a daily sacrifice. You report yourself to God daily because God loves perfection and perfection is working according to the provisions of the world and where you sin. You say Lord came in the blood. It means that you have been accepted in the beloved because that's where you always belong in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Amen. So as a part of the bride, you are in thought and therefore an eternal part of this eternal fellowship. Make that confession. an eternal partnet fellowship. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when you speak it, the devil trembles. &gt;&gt; You've mentioned it because you believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, as part of the bride, you were in his thoughts and therefore an eternal part of that eternal fellowship. So the bride has always been in his mind. &gt;&gt; Therefore, you come from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You came from God. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you look at this flesh. But some of the people in this flesh here, they didn't come from God. If they came from God, some of them would be here this morning. &gt;&gt; Because this is an eternal fellowship. I wish you understand what it means. We are not bringing the flesh but we are bringing the CD Jesus to meet God and that makes it an eternal fellowship in this earth. And from here we shall go back into our eternal fellowship. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, you came from God's mind. &gt;&gt; I want to emphasize this you have always been supernatural substance. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; You know sometimes you think oh Now I got eternal life because I came to the altar sir. You came to the altar because you had eternal life. You realize who you are. So you are an eternal substance in fellowship with an eternal God. That's how glorious this fellowship is. Okay. He says, "See how this works." &gt;&gt; God always had his thoughts for Adam. Put your name there. God always had his thoughts for Steven. Steven as he thought &gt;&gt; was yet unexpressed. &gt;&gt; But you were there SOMEWHERE A SUBSTANCE. I feel good this morning. But when the season comes, the substance puts on flesh. SO WHEN WE COME DOWN HERE ON EARTH, GOD GIVE US THE GRACE that we live the life as eternal substance that comes from God. We don't go to the baropium this kind of things because you come for an eternal world. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU CALL UPON GOD TO HELP you overcome, &gt;&gt; that faith WILL CREATE A PERFECT LIFE FOR you so that you can come down as a substance from above. He says Psalms 139. Amen. and verse 15 and 16 will give you a little idea of this. Now this is like Adam SAYING MY substance was not hid from thee. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WE WERE SUBSTANCE in the mind of God. HE SAYS MY SUBSTANCE WAS NOT HID from thee. When I was made in secret, and curiously wrote in the lowest parts of the earth, thine eyes did see my substance. yet be unperfect. AND IN THY BOOK WERE ALL MY MEMBERS written which incontinence were fashioned when as yet there was none of them BUT YOU IN SUBSTANCE FORM. The thought of God is a reality. The mind of God is a substance. When God thought you going to get in such and such a problem at such and such a time, he prepared a solution for you. AND THAT SOLUTION WHEN YOU PRAY, IT COMES DOWN A SUBSTANCE. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that the widow woman could have been created &gt;&gt; just because of Elijah? Are you together with me? There are some people I have supported, I've helped, they are believers. But sometimes I was created to support them. So when they WERE PRAYING, GOD was looking at substance somewhere. One day you may be substance to me. Praise God. Yes sir. God planned your path that will be part of this eternal fellowship and the light shined on it and gave the shadows of this eternal fellowship. It was in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; And then God shines the light of revelation. And then the light of revelation produces this eternal fellowship in types and shadows and it was given to Moses. Brother, &gt;&gt; I was part of that revelation. &gt;&gt; I'll take you here to Exodus chapter 25. I'm finishing. Don't mind. &gt;&gt; Do you love God? &gt;&gt; Do you love the word? Amen. Amen. Exodus 25:8. Now this vision of this eternal fellowship has been brought down to Moses. But when Moses is speaking, he's speaking that let us make something which represents this eternal fellowship, a shadow of the reality. Verse eight. And let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them. God dwelling among his people according to all that I show thee. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. He took Moses and showed him the new Jerusalem. The new Jerusalem was a city coming from heaven, but it was like a people and bride of the Lord Jesus. Are you together with me? And God shows Moses that. From that Moses comes to build a t is building it from the substance and this tabernacle is the shadow. He built that shadow tabernacle. And listen now, WHEN THE ARK OF THE covenant was blessed into the holy of holies, the pillar of fire came down to say, "This is what it is. A pillar of fire over the shadow." [laughter] [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A PILLAR OF FIRE. OVER THE SHADOW. Let me tell you this afternoon, WE ARE NOT BAD KINGS WHERE MOSES MET THE OTHER TABERNACLE. We are living tabernacles of the living God. The substance of the new Jerusalem is unfolding itself. and you are part of it. If there was A PILLAR OF FIRE THERE, I WANT TO TELL you there is a pillar of fire. THERE IS MORE OF THAT HERE. So when YOU COME DOWN HERE, IF there was A PILL OF FIRE, IF THERE WAS GLORY AND SHADOW, the tabernacle of Moses, how much more glory when we come together. &gt;&gt; If we can realize that this is an eternal fellowship, we wouldn't be staying in our house. We would run. to be part of the presence. We would do not come to church to listen to a lecture. We would come to church and be part of the service. Praise the Lord. Yes, we are a temple not made with hands with a pillar of fire in it AND OVER IT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IN it and over it the B of fire. Amen. Seal over the church. Eternal fellowship. Let's go to Exodus chapter 40 verse 33. He says, "And he rared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar and set up the hanging of the court gate." So Moses finished the work. Then &gt;&gt; a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Moses finished the work of the tabernacle. It was a finished work that attracted the glory of the Lord in the you know in the shadow of divine fellowship finished work. And then when you know the tabernacle was finished, the blood had flown on Mount Calvary. It was a finished work. &gt;&gt; And then the glory of the Lord comes down on the day of Pentecost upon the tabernacle. And that glory has never left. It's always with us. When we come together, there was a glory in that house of Moses. They would see the pill of fire, sufficient miracles. The road of Aaron would enter in the holy of holies and would bear arm wounds. I'm telling you, brother. This moment here, we are that living tabernacle. The glory of God is more here than it was there, but your faith brings it down. You come into presence out there. It was shadows. God shadowed himself out there. But today is a real tabernacle with a real God for a greater glory. Brother Brham &gt;&gt; used to call the glory down. substance. We don't come down here to place shadow. We come here because we are the real temple in fellowship with the real God substance eternal fellowship. Listen to the prayers of the prophet. gifts and callings are without repentance. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray now that as we dedicate the building and ourselves to you for service that you drive back every foul spirit. May men and women that's come under this roof come under the conviction May the angels of God stand by every post. Amen. around the place and take their seats. Oh God, every person here as in your divine presence. May there be such a meeting never been before in May every sinner be inspired. Every member, every Christian sinners fall under the conviction and may there be grace growing on the people and may there come the knowledge of Christ by the same great Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In expectations, he says, "May the angels of God, may they stand in the may the great angel OF GOD, SPREAD forth his wings throughout this tent tonight. Are you together with me?" Do you see what I'm talking about? Then he says, "Father, &gt;&gt; oh may you just take over from right now and anoint the building and dedicate it for you. May the angels of heaven come down of those ladders of Jacob positions now soldiers at THEIR POST OF DUTY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; If you realize &gt;&gt; that we are not in shadows anymore, we are the tabernacle. If we realize that God is not playing shadows anymore comes in every fellowship, then it's that eternal fellowship. You have come an eternal fellowship in the presence of God, the ministering of angels, the great healing power to the extent that if THERE IS A SOUL HERE, if there's he can also prophesy is an anointed house. Are you together with me? Eternal fellowship. Fellowship. We don't come here to teach lessons. We come here to bring you to that presence. In that presence, ask for God what you will. And God can supply. Amen. If you have been stuck over the years, your season could be now. all the substance. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Do you love him? Let's stand up and give the Lord just a hand of praise. [applause] It is substance fellowship. Amen. Amen. It's not coming because we imagine a god. He's real. God is here. God bless you. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you appreciate our pastor? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Let us sing that song. We are children. Praise the name of our Lord. As we prepare to speak to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are children of the father. &gt;&gt; We are joint hairs in the name of our lord. Amen. We are heers of the father. We are joiners with the son.
