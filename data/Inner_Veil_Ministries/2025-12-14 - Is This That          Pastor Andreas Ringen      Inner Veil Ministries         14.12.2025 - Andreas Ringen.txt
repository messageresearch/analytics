We all again in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Truly, it's again a privilege to be together again. Hallelujah. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Don't we serve a wonderful God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just just uh just think of it what we are able to hear today. Uh not what I preach but what all is in the message and the Bible. Everything you hear is in the Bible. But we didn't know it was in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. We didn't know it was in the Bible. It was all hidden in the Bible. Amen. And in the and in the end time, it is revealed so that we can come and dine and eat while those things are be made known that they become food on our table. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. so that we can eat as this uh I spoke we sp we we spoke in camuli about that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand? There was a little worm one day. You know, a little worm could walk only very slow, very slow walking. Amen. Very slow. But one day then he started just eating the right kind of food. And then something happened in that little worm. Out came a butterfly. Amen. Out came a butterfly. How did the change happen? Just by the worm eating and out came a butterfly. In the beginning it was walking very slowly. In the end it could fly. Amen. This is our start. This is our start. In the beginning we come very slow. But at the end we take a fly away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As we as we come and dine at the table, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just eat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's spiritual food in a time of famine. Spiritual food in due season. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has prepared us &gt;&gt; a a table. with a seven course menu in the face of our enemies. &gt;&gt; This is what was promised in the Bible. I will prepare you a table in the face of your enemies. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this is what he has done. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And that table is full. &gt;&gt; So you just have to eat. That's all. So you eat yourself into a body change. That's how simple it is. That's how simple it is. The worm is just eating and eating and eating and eating. Amen. Amen. And then one day through a process, a butterfly flies away. What a wonderful story, right? Amen. God bless you. As we stand, let us take quick our Bibles again. We want to go to the book of Joel. &gt;&gt; Joel. &gt;&gt; Joel. Old Testament. Wonderful. We have New and Old Testament together. Amen. Amen. New and Old Testament. It's the two wings a bird is flying. If you only take the Old Testament with one wing, a bird cannot fly good. With one wing, you always fly in a circle. So you need two wings to fly straight. Amen. Amen. So it's Old and New Testament. That's why I always like to read Old and New Testament. I just love the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you. &gt;&gt; I just love the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. Joel, &gt;&gt; we want to read Joel 2 21-2. &gt;&gt; Fear not, O land. Be glad and rejoice, for the Lord will do great things. Be not afraid, ye beast of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness do spring. For the tree bears her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength. Have you read carefully? &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "For the for the for the tree beareth her fruit." That's a she tree. It's a bride tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. For the tree beareth her fruit. Amen. Amen. You get that? That's a bride tree. Feminish in in designation. Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God, for he has given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. And I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerorm, and the caterpillar and the palmer, my great army, which I send among you. Amen. Amen. So God said, "I will restore all the years that the that the locust has eaten worm, caterpillar, and the palmer worm." &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's I know it's a it's a difficult beast. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aina. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will restore, says the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do we know how the beast has eaten it down? &gt;&gt; It was eaten down until it was just a stump. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But Satan had forgotten. Satan had forgotten the life of the tree lays in the roots. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the things that you don't see because the the roots you never see. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So, Satan can work on all that you see, but he cannot work on things that you don't see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's our secret. The things that he he was and Jesus was called the root and the offspring of David. Not only the offspring, &gt;&gt; but he would also call the root of David. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are not going back. We are going back &gt;&gt; to our where we come from. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Back to the roots. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then book of Acts. Quickly open. Book of Acts. Acts chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Very familiar scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we would have continued with Jo, &gt;&gt; we would have read where he said, "And I will and I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh." &gt;&gt; Amen. You know Joel, but you know Joel is speaking of very interesting as he spoke about I will restore. He spoke about this time and when he said I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh then he put also the time of Pentecost. So we really have to read the scripture how it is wrote and sometimes it jumps sometimes one scripture covers thousands of years. Is that right? In the beginning God created the prophet said that can be have can be a million years. that one sense. Amen that that one sentence in the beginning. So we want to be very attentive. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Acts chapter 2. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we go to verse 12 because of time reasons. &gt;&gt; And they were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to the other, "What meanest this?" &gt;&gt; You get that? So because there was they spoke in unknown tongues you know the story on the day of Pentecost. So and when they looked at it from outside they said what is this? What mean is this they saw a manifestation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they couldn't they couldn't place it. Watch very carefully. &gt;&gt; Others mocking said, "These men are full of new wine." So people was there and they looked to the manifestation and they say, "Oh, they have maybe drunken too much. No. But Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them, "Ye men of Judea and all that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you and hearken to my words. And I I just like that how Peter was answering. He was answering very normal. He said, "These are not drunken as he supposed but the third hour of the day." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Peter said, "No, no, they cannot be drunk because at this time of the day, nobody is drunk." &gt;&gt; Look how Peter is answering. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Down to earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Peter looked &gt;&gt; and Peter said, "No, &gt;&gt; this &gt;&gt; is that and I want to preach this afternoon on is this that Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we know the promise. &gt;&gt; We have read the promise. &gt;&gt; I will restore. &gt;&gt; And I want to ask the question is this that let us pray together. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; thank you again for your grace and for your mercy. Thank you that all that you have done. Oh God, now we pray that you take again control. I I surrender myself totally to Lord inspire me. I pray lead me and guide me. I have my notes. I have written down. I have I have prayed. I have done what I could do. Father, now you do what I cannot do. We because for this purpose we commit ourselves into have thine own way I pray. Answer the prayers of your people. Oh father I pray each and everyone walk out from here. Then he can say no no no this is that he is risen from the dead. &gt;&gt; I pray father all to your honor and to your glory in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless you. You may be seated. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's amazing, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's amazing that as we have read it and actually what happened in the in the upper room was a promise of Joel. Is that right? We could have read a little for further. And God said, I have I will pour out my spirit upon all things. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and now now you understand as it happened there was a great confusion of what this is what is happening. People were somehow confused as we have read. They were amazed. What is this now? &gt;&gt; Amen. He said they asked themselves the question, what mean is this? &gt;&gt; So they couldn't they couldn't connect the promise and the fulfillment of the promise. They couldn't connect that and this is our greatest problem. what we know. We know so many things that is promised but so many times we cannot connect the promise to the fulfillment and this is I think what brother Bernham said what man is he said now in in God hiding in simplicity the prophet said now man has their own ideas of what God ought to be and what God is going to do. As I have made the old statement many times that man remains man. Man is always giving God praise for what he did do. And we should do that. We should God give praise for what he did do and always looking forward to what he will do. Amen. Which is not wrong. We should look forward with expectation for what God is going to do. But that's not enough. He said, but ignoring what he is doing right now. The way the people miss it, they look back. Now watch now. Watch very carefully. They look back and see in what great thing God has done things but they fail to see in what simple thing he used to do. Amen. Is it not like this? We look back on what God has done and we see we see what marvelous it was and then we look at our day and we try to see the copy of it. We try to see it repeat. Is it not exactly what we try to see? There's where Pentecost fails. There is where Pentecost failed. They tried to see a repetition constantly and what as they desired a repetition the enemy could come in. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're with me. &gt;&gt; That is brother I'm said that's a major problem of humanity and then the man is looking forward. Then they look forward to see a great thing coming and it's going to happen. And nine times out of 10, it is already happening right around them. And it is so simple that they miss it, that they don't. So I'm asking you the question today. Is this that &gt;&gt; is this that &gt;&gt; or are we still waiting? &gt;&gt; You are the congregation. &gt;&gt; You are answering. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm only asking the question. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a good question, right? &gt;&gt; What do you try to see? Now we speak of restoration &gt;&gt; because God said, "I will restore &gt;&gt; all [screaming] the years." Amen. &gt;&gt; And I ask you a question. Is it coming &gt;&gt; or is this that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; You know, don't put it all on the preacher. You are going in the rapture. It is your body change. It is your personal relationship to Jesus Christ. I'm not going in the body change for you. I'm not pulling you in the body chains. I told the people at home in my own church, if the dead in Christ rise and they come to you, don't phone me. Don't phone me. I will not answer the phone because it is your walk. is your personal walk with God because they are coming to you. The dead in Christ are not coming to church. They come to you. They come to you personally. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that's why don't bring it all to the preacher. Church, we come to a time and I believe it is necessary. Amen. There's not such a big big distance between the preacher and the congregation. It comes the time when there should not be a two big distance between sheep and shepherd. &gt;&gt; I believe the shepherd should smell like sheep. I believe sheep should smell like shepherds. &gt;&gt; You know why? &gt;&gt; Because they are so close. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I trust that we are living in that hour. Amen. Amen. Because we don't know &gt;&gt; if this wonderful thing what we call church how long it might exist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know under co you you know under the co influence co &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know under co &gt;&gt; how much it disturbed the church life. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Suddenly we were not allowed to go to church. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And many people became very nervous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe God allowed it. &gt;&gt; Just to let you know, &gt;&gt; how close is your relationship? &gt;&gt; To Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As we said, we don't know when the rapture takes place when we are in church. Maybe you are in the kitchen. Maybe you are in bed. Maybe in just you in your duty. Maybe you are mechanic and you're just a new mechanic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Are we ready? Wherever we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As we saw this morning, what it means to be ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why sometimes I was I was once driving in a car &gt;&gt; which was once my job &gt;&gt; a truck driver and as I was driving it in the evening time suddenly I I understood there's somebody sitting next to me in the truck. I just understood there was such a presence in my truck. Somebody was there in the truck and I just started worshiping in the truck. I saw no one. I couldn't feel no one but someone was there. And it was such in an instance it was there. I didn't do any spiritual thing. Amen. I didn't do any spiritual thing. I was just there doing my work and before I realized there was a presence in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But as we speak of this because we have a big challenge and the challenge is the manifestation. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the challenge. &gt;&gt; What do we have? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I speak of restoration, &gt;&gt; what is your first thought? Many people their first thought is speaking in tongues like they did in the upper room. &gt;&gt; Is right. Many times when I say I when God said I will restore What do you think? &gt;&gt; What it is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember even the manifestation that Peter could say this is that. &gt;&gt; And people were marveling. People were mocking. Even people called they are drunk. &gt;&gt; You see manifestation always pulls criticism always like that. So today manifestation against pulls up the critics. The critics. Oh my my my my. The critics are going to compare. The critics they say, "Oh, these are drunk. You know why they said that? Because they had other people seen acting like that &gt;&gt; and they were drunk. So that's why the critics came up and they compared. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God is never comparing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In God's kingdom, you don't have to compare. &gt;&gt; You have to be what you are. You don't have to compare with somebody. Don't compare yourself with the pastor. Don't compare yourself with the brother and the sister. Paul said follow me as I follow Christ. He never said follow me. He never said compare me. He said follow me as I follow Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Paul became the model servant. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Paul became the model, the example servant. Is that right? He was the first one. He was the model servant. So ah there came more servants we go there a little later to see how God is doing things. How God is doing things. I think it's so wonderful if you see so don't compare with one another. Many times when you have in a church something wonderful happening then quickly people want to do the same. You see somebody speaking in tongues somebody gives an interpretation. It's a great victory of God. Next Sunday many people want to do the same. Huh? &gt;&gt; Because Satan has told them you need to be like them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my church. Peter could say, "This is that what was spoken by the prophet Joel." &gt;&gt; One week later or two weeks later, the same man was in the house of Cornelius. Is that right? The same man that said this is that was now in the house of Cornelius. And as he preached the word, the Holy Spirit fell on all that heard the word. [cheering] And again, Peter could say, "This is also that. Have you watched? Have you watched?" Peter never compared. &gt;&gt; He never compared. He never told the people in the house of Cornelius &gt;&gt; to really be a part of that promise, &gt;&gt; you must speak in tongues. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I ask you church, &gt;&gt; is this Ah, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so I'm so glad, &gt;&gt; you know, the first church that received the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, very very quick &gt;&gt; was deceived. I want to say that again. &gt;&gt; The church that the 120, especially those that were in the upper room and received the Holy Ghost after a few years, they were deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when Paul came to the church, You know, Paul was not in the upper room. &gt;&gt; Paul was not amongst the 120. When the 120 was in the upper room, Paul was still Saul persecuting the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that Paul never walked with Jesus. You know that Paul never slept around Jesus. Paul never was in the boat with Jesus. &gt;&gt; He never was in the boat with Jesus. Is that right? He never eat with Jesus. He never drank with Jesus. He had no fellowship with Jesus. and he was called to write the New Testament. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Is that not amazing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At the time when 120 was in the upper room, Paul was in Jerusalem full of ambitions to kill the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That was that was Paul. Then after after 15 20 years when he was on his way to Damascus. Is that right? The light strike him down. Is that right? A light striking him down. And he said, "So, Saul, why are you persecuting me?" And Saul &gt;&gt; was taught under Galia. &gt;&gt; He was taught under Galia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Paul or Saul knew that that light was Jehovah. It was God. So he said, "Lord, who are you?" You know the answer came back. &gt;&gt; I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now Saul said Jesus died. &gt;&gt; He said I am Jesus &gt;&gt; that you are persecuting. &gt;&gt; So Saul said Jesus is dead &gt;&gt; and I'm not persecuting Jesus. I'm persecuting the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is the Lord answering back? &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; Jesus in bride form. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I I trust we understand. &gt;&gt; As we speak of restoration, we we quickly first have to really understand what is restoration because God said, "I will restore." And now we are all looking around how how will you restore? And if I say this is that then I have to know how God is restoring me. Is that right? Peter could say this is that in the house of Cornelius. Two weeks later, three weeks later, he could say this is that total &gt;&gt; different manifestation in the house of Cornelius. Nobody spoke in tong. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So once we understand &gt;&gt; that God is not a copycat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is not somebody that is copying. &gt;&gt; This is Satan's business. &gt;&gt; Watch it. This is the antichrist movement. That's how the church first church fell. Do you know how the first church fell? They finally make dogmas and creeds to keep the move of God in the camp. Can I speak to the Pentecostals? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, not nothing against them. &gt;&gt; But you know what happened when the life left the Pentecostal church because the life is going on? You cannot denominate God's life. And as they saw the life was moving on, they were trying to keep it in the church and they made creeds and dogmas. It was the Antichrist spirit killing the move of God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it not amazing &gt;&gt; how a church &gt;&gt; full of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; becomes deceived. &gt;&gt; Is it not amazing? &gt;&gt; The church of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; And here one man came in &gt;&gt; and was not at Pentecost &gt;&gt; that had received also the Holy Ghost. Right? Did Paul receive the Holy Ghost? He he he received it while Ananas laid hands on him. Is that right? Is that right? Again, Peter could say again Peter could say this is that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my trust we understand what God is doing today. When you don't want to see the manifestation of God, don't look back. When you want to see the manifestation of God, ask him to open your eyes. &gt;&gt; So that we can say, "Hey, this is that and this is that and that is that and this is that &gt;&gt; everywhere." [cheering] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God said, "I will restore." &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question? &gt;&gt; Has he restored &gt;&gt; or is it future now? &gt;&gt; Is it future? &gt;&gt; Do we wait on what? Do we wait? &gt;&gt; He said, "I will restore." And Peter could say, "This is that." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He could say this is that in the house of Cornelius. He could say this is also that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, don't limit the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; 2,000 years. Brother, brother Ram said in feast of the trumpets, he said 2,000 years, the Holy Spirit was bound, but should be released in the evening time by a evening time message. So a message came to declare who you are &gt;&gt; to declare to declare you are a part of the restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit was bound and you see signs and wonders. I'm so glad we had a prophet. &gt;&gt; You know what happened with the first church? &gt;&gt; Paul came too late. That's why Paul said, "I'm born out of season." Paul said, "I'm born out of season." Paul understood. I come too late. That's why he told I think one of the churches. Who has bewitched you? Is it right? &gt;&gt; He's telling one of the churches, Galatians, I think it is. Who has bewitched you? You started so well &gt;&gt; on the day of Pentecost. Who has bewitched you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So Paul recognized &gt;&gt; he came too late to the church. &gt;&gt; You are there. &gt;&gt; You know why did God do that? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Why did God do that? God allowed that. Because you had to come. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Why did God allow the fall in Eden? &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you had to come. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God wanted to show things of him &gt;&gt; that he could not show without the fall. That's why. &gt;&gt; That's why God created Satan. &gt;&gt; God created Satan &gt;&gt; because God needs him. Without Satan, &gt;&gt; without the bad one, &gt;&gt; without the evil one, &gt;&gt; God cannot show that he's a good God. &gt;&gt; If we never had evil amongst us, if we never had evil amongst us, we would not know what good means. Is that right? Come on. &gt;&gt; If you never had night, &gt;&gt; you wouldn't appreciate the sun. &gt;&gt; You know how quickly we can get tired of the hot sun. How quickly we get tired of the hot sun, but then let it pour rain, rain, rain, rain. Then you start getting happy of the sun. You understand that? You understand that? I mean, I saw here you have now in December. It was too hot here, right? And people start complaining. Oh, we need, you know, it's so hot and so hot and no sun, no sun now. If it rains now for two weeks, I'm sure you are all praying for sun, [cheering] &gt;&gt; right? You understand? That's why God had to allow those things. How can we know that God is a good God if there's not evil? [cheering] That's why God needed Satan. That's why God needed the fall. Yes. That's why God needed Come on. &gt;&gt; When Paul came on the scene, you know, when the light strike him down, &gt;&gt; Paul could have said, "Why now?" And when he came to the church, the church was already a fallen woman. Can we see that? You know why? Because if Paul would be in the upper room if there's a prophet in the land, there is no deception. If there's a true major prophet in the land, there's no deception. If Paul would be in the upper room, amen, he would have discerned the antichrist spirit as this prophet discerned the antichrist spirit. And he told us in the message to watch that antichrist spirit. Read the church age book. Read the church age book. There you find him. The prophet declared him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet declared him so that we today understand what the antichrist spirit trying to do. And allow me to say. The antichrist spirit is trying to make you compare. He's trying to make you compare. Compare with this church. Compare with your church. Compare with this church. When this church has this music, we must have the same music. When that pastor is driving that car, we must have the same car. When that church has this seat, we must have the same seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you understand, &gt;&gt; Peter never compared. &gt;&gt; Peter never said in the house of Cornelius, &gt;&gt; "Oh, you didn't spoke in tongues." He never compared, "Come on, church." He could have told them, "Go in the upper room and wait." &gt;&gt; He could have told them, "Come on, church. You see the antichrist spirit working. &gt;&gt; Peter could could tell the Bible said as he preached. So he never preached about the upper room. He never preached about the upper room. He never pointed the people to the upper room. He preached the word, not words. He preached [screaming] the word. He preached Christ. And as he preached Christ without pointing them to the upper room, come on. He was he was in the upper room. He was in the upper room. He could say, "Come guys, come to the room." And we will have another upper room. Ah, &gt;&gt; that would be the antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; That's strong. Maybe &gt;&gt; you understand. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; But as he preached, the Holy Ghost fell on all. &gt;&gt; So that means Joel fulfilled itself again. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same. &gt;&gt; It's the major scripture for us. Is it right? &gt;&gt; That is actually the the major scripture of the message Jesus Christ the same. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the same doesn't mean &gt;&gt; you repeat. Oh, here we go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But allow me to we we we start we try to start slowly first. Let's really see what restoration really is. Let's also see &gt;&gt; what reformation is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's I believe where many people stumble. &gt;&gt; God said, "I will restore God never said, "I will reform." &gt;&gt; God said, "I will restore." &gt;&gt; And restore &gt;&gt; is to bring back. That's restoration. That's restoration. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Restore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now reformation allow me to to to make that plain. The difference between reformation and restoration. You can see when many people today speak of restoration actually they speak of reformation. Reformation. is to improve an established religion with new ideas. &gt;&gt; That's reformation. See what established religions trying to do today to keep the people right. They try to install new ideas, &gt;&gt; but that's reformation. &gt;&gt; That is not this. &gt;&gt; Come on church. When people say this is restoration, you can say no. That is not this because God said I will restore &gt;&gt; not reform. Restoration is a return to its original roots. That's restoration. Simple example. A restoration of the house is to bring back its original beauty. Reformation is putting new wallpaper on the wall or putting new paint. That's reformation. But restoration is bringing back the original beauty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's my sister. &gt;&gt; Paint on your face &gt;&gt; is not restoring beauty. You're trying to reform yourself. I could say the same things about the brothers. &gt;&gt; How many times we are trying to add new ideas? It's just reformation. But God said, "I will restore." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now watch. Now stay with me for a for a few minutes because to be going a little bit to the church ages and you will like the church age book after that much more than now. This judge age book give you a little example. &gt;&gt; Who choose &gt;&gt; who give name to all the animals? &gt;&gt; Adam did that species that came at last. You know the serpent came before him. You know, the serpent was on earth before Adam. &gt;&gt; So the serpent could tell Adam, "I'm longer here than you. Who are you trying to give me my name? [laughter] Is it right? You can see God had seven stars in his hand. But the last star was able to name all the other stars. [cheering] The last star in the hand of God. To him it was given to name all the other stars. Never Paul [screaming] could name all the other stars. No. Never Paul. Paul couldn't name. &gt;&gt; It was William Brennan. &gt;&gt; The last star in the hand of God &gt;&gt; because time has to run in continuity. And the last star. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was able to name all the other stars. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And here was William Brham &gt;&gt; on earth. &gt;&gt; A human being like you and me &gt;&gt; and he was looking. Now who is that star? &gt;&gt; Is that right? Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is that star? Who is the first messenger? Because revelation was writing to the messenger of the churches of Ephesus. Right. Who was that messenger? &gt;&gt; We know it was Paul today. &gt;&gt; But Paul never said, "I'm the one." &gt;&gt; It was William Brandon, &gt;&gt; the last star. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? And and watch very carefully here comes the principle out that God is always using. It is actually a keystone revelation of the whole Bible. I will read that to you makes it easier out of the church age book. Now you understand that. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Here we had a man like you and me. Now he has to find out who is what &gt;&gt; is this that? &gt;&gt; Oh no &gt;&gt; no no. [laughter] He had to find out is this man that &gt;&gt; or is this man that or is that man that? &gt;&gt; Finally, he could say Paul &gt;&gt; is the messenger to Ephesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This excites me church. &gt;&gt; This excites me. And the trust goat opens our hearts what God is doing right now because we are here declaring declaring Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday Jesus Christ is same today Jesus Christ is same forever so that we can say this is that &gt;&gt; oh I'm so happy that that we that we can dive down deep. &gt;&gt; Brother Raman said, "I'm only scratching on the surface." He said, "But you go down and you dig down deep and much more it become elevated." The prophet would say, "God would raise young men, ministers that would dig down deep not because they are clever, not because they are special mates, but because they heal themselves to the spirit of wisdom and revelation so that he can bring out the deep things of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; I know that will that will bother some of us. &gt;&gt; But he was a man William Brandham. &gt;&gt; He looked through historical books. He was reading the revival books of the church history. Remember why Paul? Paul never was with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Paul persecuted the Jews. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why Paul was chosen &gt;&gt; to be the church as messenger to Ephesus? Why not Peter? &gt;&gt; Why not James? &gt;&gt; Why not John? &gt;&gt; Why not Luke? &gt;&gt; Why not Matthew? &gt;&gt; Why Paul? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, when you once understand God's great plan, &gt;&gt; then you understand why you had to choose Paul. Now remember, brother Wam was choosing him because he had a scriptural key. And with that scriptural key, he was looking He was looking &gt;&gt; right. A key is there to open doors. And his scriptural key that scripture key was Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. with that key &gt;&gt; he could say this &gt;&gt; is that &gt;&gt; this is the messenger to Ephesus &gt;&gt; church with that key &gt;&gt; in our hands we can say today this is that this is that this is that And you're not looking for copies. &gt;&gt; As we said when Peter was in the house of Cornelius, &gt;&gt; he could say again this is that and nobody spoke in tongues. &gt;&gt; You can follow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who was it? Then he went on. Then there was a man Ireinius. &gt;&gt; Arinius. &gt;&gt; Arinius &gt;&gt; the church age messenger. &gt;&gt; And by the way Paul &gt;&gt; I think was not married. Is that right? Paul was not married. Martin Luther &gt;&gt; Martin Luther &gt;&gt; was married. &gt;&gt; John Wesley &gt;&gt; was married. &gt;&gt; Arinius. &gt;&gt; Arinas. &gt;&gt; Many of the messengers &gt;&gt; were married. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just to that the penny can drop. How God is doing things. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; And the prophet used a scripture key to find out Paul, to find out Arinius, to find out Martin, to find out Cola, to find out Martin Luther. Martin Lutter is my German brother. I tell you what, I would have never chosen him to be the messenger. &gt;&gt; You know why? &gt;&gt; You know why? &gt;&gt; He was a trinitarian. &gt;&gt; He was a trinitarian. &gt;&gt; He hated the Jewish people. He liked to drink wine. &gt;&gt; I would never have chosen a messenger. [sighs] Are you with me &gt;&gt; now? &gt;&gt; What is God looking at &gt;&gt; so that he can say &gt;&gt; this is that no &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I pray that God helps us to break into it to understand that God ordained your life. God ordained your parents. God ordained your grandparents. God ordained your grand great grandparents so you could turn up because God wanted to show &gt;&gt; through you a special part of himself. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What did God wanted to manifest in the time of Martin Luther? Justification. just shall live by faith. That's why he needed someone that was drinking to manifest to manifest the just shall live by faith. You understand that it depends what God wants to show. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of God raising the standard against him. My my my my &gt;&gt; one day &gt;&gt; the devil was coming to Martin Luther &gt;&gt; and said, "Martin, &gt;&gt; you drink too much." &gt;&gt; You know what L said? If you come to me and rebuke me of drinking too much, I drink another one. Why? Why don't we do the same thing today? Because today God want to show more of him. But that time coming out of the Catholic. Yes. Coming out of works, works. works works works. God want to show no I will have a man who can show and demonstrate the just shall live by faith. You understand it depends what God wants to show from him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now we have to we have to leave that the time is time is running. &gt;&gt; But you understand. &gt;&gt; That's why the whole church ages was not restoration even 1906 the great outpouring. The restoration of the gifts &gt;&gt; was reformation. Amen. &gt;&gt; You better believe that because we had a we had a messenger who who told us and because he told us this church will not be deceived. That's why we today are not being deceived because we had a messenger. The first church missed that messenger in the upper room. That's why the antichrist spirit could come into the church. One comparing with the other &gt;&gt; bishops &gt;&gt; over bishops Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Come on. &gt;&gt; What was that? &gt;&gt; The Antichrist spirit moving in. &gt;&gt; I'm more value than you. I'm a higher bishop than you. Come on. And this came to a climax in the dark ages. Is that right? You had to pay. You had to confess. You had to pay for your soul to come out of hell. And then God needed a character. He needed a Martin Luther because he wanted to show in that church age that the just shall live by faith. That's why when brother Brandham looked at Martin Luther, &gt;&gt; he said that's the man for that church age. John Wesley. &gt;&gt; John Wesley. &gt;&gt; John Wesley. &gt;&gt; He was a church age messenger &gt;&gt; to the church age. Let me quickly read it. I'm not good in remembering. Of Philadelphia. &gt;&gt; Philadelphia. [sighs] &gt;&gt; John Wesley. &gt;&gt; John Wesley &gt;&gt; had a broken up marriage. First of all, &gt;&gt; Paul was not married. &gt;&gt; John Wesley was married. So if you look to the messengers you understand not one messenger was a copy of the other one. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ the same is not you compare with one another. Jesus Christ the same that is this Jesus Christ the same. Hebrews 13:8. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not you try to be like brother Steven. &gt;&gt; You not try to copy brother &gt;&gt; SA. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You not copy that guy from Germany. &gt;&gt; You be what you are. You be [cheering] what you are &gt;&gt; because God needs you. &gt;&gt; I always tell the people at home, &gt;&gt; God invested in you so much money and so much brain he was not cheap to bring you here. You know that it was not easy to bring you here. Go back to your family tree. My family tree, &gt;&gt; my grandfather was in World War II. &gt;&gt; My mother &gt;&gt; or my father actually he was uh he was engaged to another woman. I just want to show you my mother &gt;&gt; before my father married her, &gt;&gt; my mother my mother was engaged to another man or my mother or my grandmother. It broke. so that my father &gt;&gt; and my mother could marry so I &gt;&gt; can be today what I am. Oh, come on. Go back your history. Go back your family tree. You how many times your great great great grandfathers, &gt;&gt; mothers could have died on the way. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. You know how much brain, &gt;&gt; how much sweat &gt;&gt; God invested in your coming. He had a host of angels busy to preparing to protect your great grandparents to protect your parents so that you can be here right now. Amen. [cheering] So don't become a cheap copy. Be what you are. Be a Christian. Be a Christian, &gt;&gt; but be what you are. &gt;&gt; If you are a sister, be happy that you are a sister. &gt;&gt; Don't try to be a man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're a man, &gt;&gt; be a man. &gt;&gt; Don't try to be a sister. &gt;&gt; Come on. Is that simple enough? Is that simple enough? &gt;&gt; So when you are what you are, &gt;&gt; I can say this is that If you are a Christian, if you are a Christian today, born again by the Holy Ghost, I can say this is that [cheering] I will restore and I can say God has restored. &gt;&gt; God has restored all the [screaming] years that was beaten down. The bride tree is standing again. And her fruits, her fruits, her fruits, &gt;&gt; not his fruits, her fruits. Have you not read that in the beginning? It is her fruits. It's a feminist tree. It's a feminist tree. &gt;&gt; It is a bride of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why I can say today. &gt;&gt; No, we have so many points, so many things. &gt;&gt; No, we we we don't do we don't go there. &gt;&gt; But you know what the problem was at Pentecost? &gt;&gt; The problem was manifestation. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem was the manifestation. People marveled. What is this? Some was mocking. They are drunk. What do they say today? They are fanatics. &gt;&gt; They are cults. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's what they did at that time. When they saw the manifestation, they had to put it in a box. &gt;&gt; This is what Satan always has to do. He has to put you in a box. But the bride of Jesus Christ is fitting in no box. [cheering] Because the bride of Jesus Christ is out of every box. She's called to come outside the camp. She's called out of my people. Come out of every denomination. Come out of every limitation. Because denimation &gt;&gt; creates and darkmas limitations. You understand that denominations &gt;&gt; is limitations. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let me give you an example. &gt;&gt; Poor limitations. I I had a a brother from Italy. &gt;&gt; You stay here. Okay. I go down. &gt;&gt; I had a brother from Italy. Italy, an old brother in the message, one of the veterans. And one day, uh, Jehovah witness came to him. Anybody Jehovah witness here? Jehovah witness don't be don't feel offended. Okay? But it just shows you as you call yourself Jehovah witness, &gt;&gt; you limit yourself. You limit yourself. &gt;&gt; As soon as you call you Pentecost, &gt;&gt; you limit yourself. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; You call yourself Methodist Methodist. &gt;&gt; You limit yourself. &gt;&gt; We are not Methodist. &gt;&gt; Methodist. &gt;&gt; We not Baptist. &gt;&gt; We're not Pentecostals. We are not Catholics. We are Christians. &gt;&gt; That means [cheering] if you're a Christian, &gt;&gt; you are Christlike. &gt;&gt; With other words, you say, &gt;&gt; "I am &gt;&gt; Christ." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't limit yourself. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm the new Methodist. &gt;&gt; I'm the original Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; Just put you just puts limits around you. I'm the orthodox of the orthodox of the orthodox of the orthodox. You have limit and limit and limit and limit yourself. We are of Moses. &gt;&gt; Who are you? &gt;&gt; We believe Moses. &gt;&gt; Is that not what they said &gt;&gt; in Jesus time? &gt;&gt; We are of Moses. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Limit themsel. Come on church. &gt;&gt; Then then Jesus would say, &gt;&gt; "Search the scriptures." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For in them you think you have eternal life &gt;&gt; and they speak of me. &gt;&gt; Now listen, it's beautiful. There was two Jehovah witness. &gt;&gt; Okay. to Jehovah witness knocking at the brother's door. So they came in, you know how it is. They introduced themselves, &gt;&gt; said, "Hello, good day. &gt;&gt; We are Jehovah Witness witness. &gt;&gt; We would like to talk. Would you like to talk to us?" The brother said, "Oh, that's interesting. You are witness. I am his son. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; So as they have classified themselves to Jehovah witness put a limitation around them. The brother said that's funny. You are witnesses. &gt;&gt; I'm a son. [applause] So who has more influence on the father? A witness or a son? So why stay Jehovah witness? Why stay Jehovah witness? Come to be a son. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. [applause] &gt;&gt; Why stay a Pentecostal? &gt;&gt; Why stay a Methodist? &gt;&gt; Why stay a Baptist? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; You just put limitations around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why not come to our to be in doubt? &gt;&gt; You can say I am what I am by the grace of God. If God tells me, &gt;&gt; you know that Eve, &gt;&gt; the woman never spoke about herself. It was Adam &gt;&gt; speaking about her. What I tell you today of who you are, &gt;&gt; it is what the second Adam The last Adam has spoken about you [applause] &gt;&gt; has spoken about me. That's why I can say today I believe what he said about me. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And I'm so happy that I can speak to people that he has called the bride of [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Because of misunderstood manifestations today people start denominations. &gt;&gt; Because of misunderstood manifestations people start denominations. As it was 2,000 years ago, people looked, some was marveling, what is this? Others were mocking. Oh, &gt;&gt; they are drunk. Right. What did Peter say? They're not drunk. &gt;&gt; It's too early. It's too early. &gt;&gt; Be normal. That's right. &gt;&gt; This hour of the day, nobody is trying. &gt;&gt; I enjoy how Peter was answering. He was not making it spiritual. He said, "Come on, boys. Come to your normal senses. At this time of the day, nobody is coming. And I want to say today all that calls this fanatism come to normal in this hour. &gt;&gt; In this hour [screaming] you cannot be a fanatic. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are living in a fanatic world. We living in a crazy world. &gt;&gt; Don't call this fanatism. &gt;&gt; No, this what you call fanatism. A group of people, they believe what God said about them. What you call fanatism? What you call fanatism? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's people &gt;&gt; that believe God said about what should the woman do. &gt;&gt; What should what should Eve do? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; What should she do now? &gt;&gt; Should she play humble? Oh, I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy. My husband said, "I'm flesh of his flesh, but who am I? My my husband said I'm his womb. But maybe he was wrong. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ on earth. &gt;&gt; We have received the message. The opening of the seals, the seals is Christ proclaiming a message to the church. &gt;&gt; You want to read? I can read to you the letter that God was writing to the church of Laia. I can You want to read it? Go home and read Revelation 3. You can read all what God was writing where God said, "I have against thee." But in this hour, in this hour, the Holy Ghost told the prophet, "Pick up your pen and write, I have something to say to my church." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Only because of this, &gt;&gt; I can preach what I preach. only because of this I can say what I say and if you listen to me carefully I only said what he said &gt;&gt; I cannot help that Adam said you are bone of my bone your flesh of my flesh I call you woman &gt;&gt; you know that woman is not a name. You know, woman is not a name. &gt;&gt; No, woman is a position. That's why brother said I'm here to declare I don't call you church any longer. I call you bride. Bride is not a name. Bride is a position. [applause] And Adam said your name that means who you are. You understand that your name classifies who you are. &gt;&gt; Said you are woman. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? Woman means &gt;&gt; stay with me for two minutes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Woman means &gt;&gt; the womb of the manh. [laughter] Not it's it's reality, church. &gt;&gt; Adam lost his womb. Hey, [laughter] and Adam understood &gt;&gt; without my womb. &gt;&gt; I can do nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're with me. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You follow it. You follow it &gt;&gt; the way Adam reacted. &gt;&gt; Why did Adam went with her? &gt;&gt; Adam was a prophet. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He saw every every sick home. He saw every disease coming because of the fall. And yet he chose his wife. You know why? [screaming] There was no other one. &gt;&gt; There was no other womb. Without the woman, &gt;&gt; he could do nothing. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Allow me to say &gt;&gt; without you. &gt;&gt; Christ &gt;&gt; can do nothing. [applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You know why? as God &gt;&gt; put Adam to sleep &gt;&gt; and he took out of Adam &gt;&gt; the womb the feminist part &gt;&gt; is that right &gt;&gt; so God put Christ &gt;&gt; at Calvary in a deep sleep &gt;&gt; can I say it like this to take the feminist part out of Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And 2,000 years 2,000 years. Christ is looking for his bride. and his promise I will restore all the years that that bride tree was going down but now we see the bride tree can you see him in your life can you see him in your life I not speak of a church building because this is That &gt;&gt; becomes personal today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Becomes personal today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad &gt;&gt; we had a prophet in the land. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad. Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We have to stop. [applause] Yes. All glory is to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is &gt;&gt; this &gt;&gt; that &gt;&gt; are you the restoration? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some say &gt;&gt; they are drunk. &gt;&gt; Some say they are just fanatics. &gt;&gt; Some marvel. What is this? &gt;&gt; But Peter could say this. They &gt;&gt; 120. Everyone is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and church. Allow me to say this. Everyone here who is a Christian who is born again who has received the Holy Ghost is that was spoken by the prophet. [applause] Isn't that wonderful? Sorry, I had no time to read to you all the quotes. To read to you all the quotes. I have dozens of quotes. So, but what I preached, you believe it was what the prophet said. I would never never be courage enough to say you these things without having the prophet for it. Let us stand to our feet. Amen. God bless you. [applause] &gt;&gt; If [applause] if this &gt;&gt; is that we are further than we think. Is that right? If this is that, you are the judge. Now, &gt;&gt; you are the judge. &gt;&gt; I don't say that. &gt;&gt; You have to say it. &gt;&gt; You have to look in your own life. &gt;&gt; My goodness. My goodness. My goodness. Jesus was in his own life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was at the cross thirsty, &gt;&gt; forgotten. He was at the cross, forgotten, despised, spit at. And he know there was one scripture that was not fulfilled. And he said, &gt;&gt; "I'm thirsty to fulfill what the prophet &gt;&gt; had already spoken." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. I pray that the Lord allows us to step into that reality. I pray &gt;&gt; I can do not more than this preaching. &gt;&gt; The rest is up to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say &gt;&gt; as a born again believer filled with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; can you look at your life and have the courage to say this? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; As I said this morning, the rapture will happen in an unusual way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In a time of great trouble, great persecution, great things in Satan's Eden, &gt;&gt; he shall hide me in the secret of his pavilion. He shall set me upon a rock. &gt;&gt; I want to ask that again. &gt;&gt; Every truly born again Christian filled with the Holy Ghost. Can you look into your life? Look to your circumstance. Can you say &gt;&gt; this &gt;&gt; is that? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you read Hebrews 11, &gt;&gt; the great faith chapter, &gt;&gt; would you see it as an act of faith? to be cut into pieces. The Bible said by faith it would cut into pieces. You need faith &gt;&gt; for your healing. You need more faith when you are not healed. &gt;&gt; I want to say that again. You need faith for healing. When you are not healed, you need more faith. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is this that just one or two minutes? &gt;&gt; Maybe we close our eyes. &gt;&gt; Just close your eyes. Can you say &gt;&gt; with conviction &gt;&gt; this &gt;&gt; is that &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If this is that &gt;&gt; then the body change is not far away. If this is that the [music] great restoration, if you cannot say that maybe so many things confuse you, maybe the manifestation is confusing and you cannot really place it. Would you raise your hand and say, "Lord, help me. church. I never said this is that. It was just a question. When I speak for myself, I can say today in great humility this that as we have lifted our hands, we want to ask the Lord now to give us a clearer understanding that we are not confused about the manifestation. who want a greater &gt;&gt; understanding of the true manifestation of this hour. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together &gt;&gt; in this solemn moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yo too was promised. I will restore. is this that heavenly father I will and I don't I didn't preach to convince the people I just preached &gt;&gt; that your holy spirit can take it further you have seen so many hands is raised father because of the manifestation It was 2,000 years.

Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit as he is a gentleman, he is not pushing you. [music] He waits for you. He waits for you. Remember in the days of Noah, where did the call came from? When did Noah went into the ark? The Bible said there was a day when God said to Noah. &gt;&gt; Noah, come into the ark. Amen. &gt;&gt; God never said to Noah, "Go in the ark." He said, "Come in the ark." It was God pulling him into the ark. This is not the third push. This is the third Paul. He's a gentleman, isn't he? Oh, don't we serve a wonderful God? He's a gentleman. He's not pushing at you. &gt;&gt; But I want to close with this again. Is this that is this that I can say today? &gt;&gt; Yes. I can speak for myself. I can say yes.
