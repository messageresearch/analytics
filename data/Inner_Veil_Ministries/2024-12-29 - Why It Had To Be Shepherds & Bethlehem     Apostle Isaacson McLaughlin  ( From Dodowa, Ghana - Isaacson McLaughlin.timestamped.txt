[58:36] was studying in the
[58:39] University but I began to call him Dr

[59:14] hopeful hallelujah hallelujah the day I
[59:17] heard a
[59:18] story he went to the hospital with the
[59:22] mother little I'm talking about
[59:26] and the nurses and the doctors were not
[59:28] allowing her to enter the world because
[59:30] he's a
[59:33] child she told the mother don't they
[59:36] know I'm going to be a doctor one
[59:39] day I said why did they prevent The

[59:48] Faith whatever you want to be in
[59:50] future whatever your ambition
[59:54] is Proclaim it
[59:57] and it will come to
[59:58] pass when I was young when I was a child
[1:00:03] I told my
[1:00:04] siblings I am going to be an
[1:00:07] ambassador so
[1:00:10] politically I went to University to
[1:00:12] study political
[1:00:15] science and the Ambassador I was
[1:00:18] thinking is to represent my country in
[1:00:20] another foreign
[1:00:23] country but God also have a different
[1:00:25] ambassador
[1:00:27] it is not a political government
[1:00:30] Ambassador but in God's book he's an
[1:00:34] ambassador he's a missionary to another
[1:00:38] country and by his grace I have traveled
[1:00:42] to over 23
[1:00:44] countries preaching the Gospel of Jesus
[1:00:48] Christ across
[1:00:51] Africa across the Caribbean islands
[1:00:56] America I am still a young
[1:00:59] man but it is what God put in me and
[1:01:03] what I
[1:01:04] confess and that is what is
[1:01:06] happening amen and amen I want to thank
[1:01:11] Pastor for giving me the
[1:01:14] opportunity to come and be a blessing to
[1:01:17] you I want to appreciate Pastor James
[1:01:21] also for his love and I want to thank my
[1:01:25] dear friend pastor
[1:01:27] jeremia for hosting
[1:01:30] me it has been a blessing I want to
[1:01:33] thank sister Deb
[1:01:36] also we had a wonderful Crusade last
[1:01:40] week it was a real
[1:01:43] blessing and we really have a good time
[1:01:45] in the presence of the
[1:01:48] Lord all the musicians that came from
[1:01:51] this place to help us the Lord bless you
[1:01:56] we are grateful unto the
[1:01:59] Lord the pastor told me to take my
[1:02:02] time so why I'm taking my
[1:02:05] time don't be
[1:02:07] hurry this is the last Sunday of the
[1:02:10] year you can even spend the whole
[1:02:14] day when you go to
[1:02:16] Israel in the Sabbath day they spend the
[1:02:18] whole
[1:02:21] day from the sunset of Friday to the
[1:02:24] sunset of Saturday
[1:02:28] they in the temple praising the
[1:02:31] Lord so don't be in
[1:02:33] hurry I want to fail at
[1:02:37] home I chose my friend to interpret me
[1:02:41] because he has interpreted me in many
[1:02:45] places when I talk
[1:02:48] naturally sometimes he doesn't hear
[1:02:51] me when I'm preaching under
[1:02:54] anointing interpret
[1:02:57] accordingly now you wonder is this this
[1:02:59] person was not hearing you when you were
[1:03:03] talking and I'm a little bit fast
[1:03:07] preacher so sometimes I tell the
[1:03:10] interpreters before they
[1:03:12] come amen and amen and sometimes by the
[1:03:16] grace of
[1:03:17] God even in a strange
[1:03:20] Country When The Interpreter make a
[1:03:23] mistake the Holy Ghost tells me
[1:03:26] and I stopped them and I say it in their
[1:03:30] language I was it happened in
[1:03:33] Mal and I was telling that testimony in
[1:03:36] Kenya and after telling that
[1:03:39] testimony we're
[1:03:41] preaching was saying something else so
[1:03:44] the Lord helped me to stop him so I said
[1:03:47] it in the
[1:03:48] language that is how sometimes God
[1:03:50] confirm his
[1:03:52] word so the world is in a Christmas
[1:03:55] season
[1:03:57] that is the world and there is nothing

[1:08:22] read from Matthew chapter 2
[1:08:26] but read first from Luke
[1:08:30] 2 I don't know why somehow God made
[1:08:33] those scriptures or those stories fall
[1:08:36] in these two
[1:08:40] scriptures read from Luke
[1:08:43] 2 verse one then we read again from
[1:08:49] Matthew Chapter
[1:08:51] 2 it looks as if they are two different
[1:08:54] context
[1:08:57] but he give us the same
[1:09:01] inspiration I am now bringing my
[1:09:03] Christmas
[1:09:05] message I hope I am not out of
[1:09:09] order Luke Chapter
[1:09:11] 2
[1:09:13] ver praise the
[1:09:15] Lord Luke 2
[1:09:18] verse says and it came to pass in those
[1:09:23] days that there went a decree from
[1:09:26] Caesar Augustus that all the world
[1:09:29] should be
[1:09:36] taxed and this taxing was first made
[1:09:39] when serenus was governor of
[1:09:47] Syria and all went to be tax everyone to
[1:09:51] his own City
[1:09:58] and Joseph also went up From Galilee out
[1:10:02] of the city of Nazareth into Judea onto
[1:10:06] the city of David which is called
[1:10:09] Bethlehem because he was of the house
[1:10:12] and lineage of
[1:10:31] to be taxed with Mary his wife being
[1:10:34] great with
[1:10:41] child verse
[1:10:43] six and so it was that while they were
[1:10:47] there the days were accomplished that
[1:10:49] she be delivered
[1:10:57] and she brought forth her first son and
[1:11:00] wrapped him in swling clothes and laid
[1:11:04] him in a Manger because there was no
[1:11:07] room for them in the
[1:11:20] in and there were in the same country
[1:11:23] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[1:11:26] watch over their flock by
[1:11:36] night and lo the angel of the Lord Came
[1:11:39] Upon them and the glory of the Lord sh
[1:11:42] ran about them and they were so
[1:11:53] afraid and the said unto them fear not
[1:11:57] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[1:12:00] great joy which shall be to all
[1:12:11] people for unto you is Born This Day in
[1:12:16] the city of David a savior which is
[1:12:27] and this shall be a sign unto you ye
[1:12:30] shall find the bab WRA in swling clothes
[1:12:34] laying in the
[1:12:49] manger and suddenly there was with the
[1:12:53] angel a multitude of of heavenly host
[1:12:56] praising God and
[1:13:02] saying glory to God in the highest and
[1:13:06] on Earth peace Good Will towards
[1:13:21] men and it came to pass as the angels
[1:13:25] were gone away from them into heaven the
[1:13:28] shepherd said one to the other let us
[1:13:33] now go onto Bethlehem and see these
[1:13:36] things which is come to pass which the
[1:13:39] Lord had made
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:52] known blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:13:55] and they came with h and found Mary and
[1:13:58] Joseph and a babe laying in a
[1:14:08] manger and when they had seen it they
[1:14:11] made known abroad the same which was
[1:14:14] told them concerning this child
[1:14:26] and all they that had it wondered at
[1:14:30] those things which were told them by the
[1:14:36] Shepherds but Mary kept all these things
[1:14:41] and
[1:14:48] in how many of you are going to be
[1:14:50] married this
[1:14:52] morning and the Shepherds turn
[1:14:55] glorifying and praising God for all the
[1:14:58] things that they have heard and seen as
[1:15:01] it was told unto them
[1:15:11] our shall we pray again Heavenly Father

[1:27:07] a king for
[1:27:08] myself God chose that King when King sa

[1:27:24] who a prophet
[1:27:27] is the coming of a prophet is not
[1:27:30] something to joke
[1:27:32] about they know he doesn't appear

[1:28:56] and they were coming Serv
[1:28:59] sons and were

[1:30:03] a
[1:30:05] mistake if God says he have chosen
[1:30:08] himself a king then there must be a king

[1:57:23] goats and the one that takes care of
[1:57:28] sheep blessed be the name of the
[1:57:32] Lord why you have to be
[1:57:36] shepher sometime they are all called
[1:57:41] Shepherds or
[1:57:43] headsmen but the keeper of the
[1:57:47] sheep they are
[1:57:50] special but Abraham said when when he
[1:57:52] went to the old country in
[1:57:56] Israel in the
[1:57:58] daytime said he will see those animals
[1:58:02] following their Shepherd to go and
[1:58:07] eat but when night time

[1:58:43] Shepherd that keeps the
[1:58:45] Sheep he's the only one that does not
[1:58:49] live
[1:59:00] by the time the angel brought the news
[1:59:03] to the
[1:59:05] Shepherds the scripture says they were
[1:59:08] biding in the
[1:59:09] field keeping water over their
[1:59:13] flocks By
[1:59:15] Night hallelujah
[1:59:18] hallelujah what actually happened
[1:59:22] every
[1:59:24] night before they sleep every
[1:59:28] evening the shepherd begin to count the
[1:59:33] sheep and put them where they
[1:59:37] belong then when he
[1:59:39] finish the shepherd lays
[1:59:45] down at the
[1:59:47] entrance he lays down and sleep
[1:59:52] as he lays down to
[1:59:54] sleep he
[1:59:55] automatically becomes the
[1:59:58] door the
[2:00:00] shipold and Jesus says in John 10 that I
[2:00:06] am the door to the
[2:00:09] [Applause]
[2:00:12] sheep and when the shepherd is
[2:00:15] sleeping and hear any
[2:00:19] sound he wakes up
[2:00:22] hallelujah hallelujah no one can comes
[2:00:25] in or goes
[2:00:27] out unless through
[2:00:30] the in other words the shepherd is so
[2:00:35] mindful of his sheep until he lays down
[2:00:40] his
[2:00:41] life for the sheep and Jesus Christ he
[2:00:46] our great

[2:02:12] shepherd does not care to enter the
[2:02:16] dit with the sheep and take it from

[2:02:22] saw all those things in the wilderness
[2:02:26] and David said in Psalm

[2:02:31] 23 thy rod and thy staff they comfort
