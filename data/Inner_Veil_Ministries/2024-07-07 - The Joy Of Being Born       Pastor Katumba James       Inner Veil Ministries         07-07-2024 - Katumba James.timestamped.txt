[51:30] great Lord Jesus you are awesome Lord
[51:34] and we bless your Hol name us through
[51:36] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:40] us amen let us go to the Book of Luke
[51:44] chapter
[51:47] 1 we are reading from verse
[51:53] 5 praise the name of the Lord says there
[51:57] was in the days of Herod the King of
[51:59] Judea a certain priest named zacharius
[52:03] of the coast of ABIA and his wife was of
[52:06] the daughters of Aaron and her name was
[52:08] Elizabeth
[52:30] and they were both righteous before God
[52:33] walking in all the Commandments and
[52:36] ordinances of the Lord
[52:50] blameless and they had no child because
[52:53] that Elizabeth was baren and they both
[52:56] were now well stricken in
[53:05] age and it came to bir that while he
[53:08] exed the pri's office before God in the
[53:10] order of his cause according to the
[53:13] custom of the priest's office his lot
[53:15] was to burn incense when he went into
[53:18] the Temple of the Lord
[53:45] and the whole mud of the people were
[53:47] praying without at the time of incense
[53:50] and there appeared un him an angel of
[53:52] the Lord standing on the right side of
[53:54] the altar of incense
[54:12] and when Zacharia saw him he was
[54:14] troubled and fear fell upon
[54:19] Him n but the angel said unto him fear
[54:24] not Zacharia for thy prayer is had and
[54:27] thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[54:30] and thou shall call his name
[54:45] John and thou shall have joy and
[54:47] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[54:57] may God of his word may be SE I want to
[55:01] preach about the joy of being
[55:08] born the joy of being
[55:12] born now here we see that Zacharia and
[55:16] Elizabeth they didn't have a
[55:22] child and you know if when a family does
[55:26] doesn't have a
[55:28] child many times there is sorrow in that
[55:32] family praise the name of our Lord there
[55:35] is always
[55:37] sorrow and you see the way the scripture
[55:40] says that there are certain things which
[55:43] they say it's not
[55:46] enough praise the name of our Lord and
[55:49] then the Bible gives about the examples
[55:51] of the things that say it's not enough
[55:57] I just want to get that
[55:59] scripture but one of
[56:02] them is a baren
[56:06] wom when a woman doesn't give
[56:11] birth it's she says it's not
[56:15] enough praise the name of our Lord and
[56:18] so now when they are not
[56:22] producing let us go to Proverbs Chapter
[56:25] 30
[56:36] Proverbs 1 verse
[56:41] 15 he says the H has two daughters
[56:47] crying give give
[56:59] there are three things that are never
[57:03] satisfied yeah four things it is not
[57:07] it's not
[57:18] enough he says the
[57:20] grave so the grave is ready to take all
[57:23] the people
[57:27] and you know there's a scripture which
[57:29] says When sin
[57:32] increases even hell
[57:35] expands in other words ready to bring
[57:40] more now then he again he says and the
[57:45] bar
[57:48] womb it says it's not
[57:53] enough then he says the Earth that is
[57:56] not filled with
[58:02] water whatever water comes is all taken
[58:06] up and the fire that says not it's not
[58:12] enough praise the name of the Lord so
[58:15] now we see that in the family of
[58:18] Zakaria he saw a vision of an
[58:22] Angel and then the angel told him you
[58:24] are going to give birth to a son
[58:28] and then the angel
[58:30] says that many
[58:33] people shall
[58:36] rejoice at his birth now we see that the
[58:39] natural
[58:41] birth bring such
[58:43] Joy praise the name of our Lord brings
[58:46] Joy to the
[58:47] family brings Joy to the
[58:50] community pray the every person is
[58:53] Happy praise the name of our
[58:56] you know there is no morning when
[58:58] somebody is
[58:59] born but there is
[59:01] celebration there is joy everybody shows
[59:05] the
[59:05] kindness they want to come and look at
[59:08] the baby they want to come and hold the
[59:10] baby then they come and congratulate the
[59:13] mother congratulate the father and
[59:16] everybody is
[59:18] Happy praise the name of our living and
[59:21] so now the birth of John brought Jo
[59:27] to the family and even Joy to the
[59:31] Community Praise the name of our Lord so
[59:34] Elizabeth
[59:36] conceived praise the name of our Lord
[59:39] when she
[59:40] conceived you know it was something like
[59:42] she was like such a great joy in
[59:47] her until the Bible
[59:50] says she hid
[59:53] herself
[59:55] months praise the name of our Lord and
[59:57] then she said God is taking away my
[1:00:00] reproach among
[1:00:03] men there is a lot of joy in the natural
[1:00:08] B there's a lot of celebration in our
[1:00:10] natural
[1:00:12] B but now if the first birth brings such
[1:00:17] Joy how about the second
[1:00:20] bus praise the name of our Lord yet the
[1:00:23] first bus brings something of
[1:00:27] time something that's going to die
[1:00:31] something that's literally
[1:00:33] temporary how much more about the second
[1:00:37] bir how much joy does it
[1:00:41] bring if you are born again praise the
[1:00:44] name of our Lord the Bible says there is
[1:00:47] a lot of joy in
[1:00:49] heaven when one sinner is
[1:00:52] converted praise the name of our Lord
[1:00:55] the
[1:00:57] makes the seven
[1:00:59] celebrate praise the name of our Lord
[1:01:02] like when our sister here praise the
[1:01:05] name of our Lord when she accepted the
[1:01:07] Lord Jesus as her personal
[1:01:10] savior there was great joy in
[1:01:13] heaven praise the name of our Lord here
[1:01:16] on Earth under the Earth
[1:01:19] Kingdom there is Joy but now in the
[1:01:22] kingdom of God the Angels celebrate
[1:01:26] when one sinner is converted into the
[1:01:28] kingdom of
[1:01:30] God praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:01:33] go to Luke chapter
[1:01:36] 15 and then read from verse
[1:01:44] one so the Bible says then then Drew
[1:01:48] near unto him all the publicans and
[1:01:51] sinners for to hear him and the
[1:01:53] Pharisees and scribes mama saying this
[1:01:57] man receiveth Sinners and eateth with
[1:02:18] them spoke this Parable unto them
[1:02:24] saying what man of you having a 100
[1:02:28] sheep if he lose one of them does not
[1:02:31] leave the 90 and N in the wilderness and
[1:02:35] go after that which is lost until he
[1:02:38] find
[1:02:54] it and when he has found it he lays it
[1:02:58] on his shoulders
[1:03:06] rejoicing and when he cometh home he
[1:03:09] calls together his friends and neighbors
[1:03:12] saying unto them Rejoice with me for I
[1:03:15] have found my sheep which was lost
[1:03:34] I say unto you that likewise Joy shall
[1:03:38] be in heaven over one sin that
[1:03:41] repentance more than over the 99 just
[1:03:45] persons which need no repentance
[1:04:01] praise the name of our Lord so there is
[1:04:03] Joy at our new
[1:04:05] bir and this Joy the Bible says is in
[1:04:09] heaven Angels rejoice when a sinner is
[1:04:13] Born
[1:04:14] Again praise the name of our Lord Angels
[1:04:17] rejoice when you identify your
[1:04:21] position Angels rejoice when you are
[1:04:24] born into the kingdom
[1:04:27] just like when you are born here on
[1:04:29] Earth and you are born in a
[1:04:32] family you receive a
[1:04:35] possession you receive you know kind of
[1:04:38] like a
[1:04:40] portion so even us when we are born into
[1:04:43] the kingdom of God we receive our
[1:04:48] inheritance praise the name of our Lord
[1:04:51] we
[1:04:52] identify that we are part of the Kingdom
[1:04:56] praise the name of our Lord and that's
[1:04:58] why we need to
[1:04:59] desire to be born again don't be
[1:05:03] satisfied by only your first
[1:05:07] birth but make sure that you are born
[1:05:10] again make sure that you are born into
[1:05:12] the kingdom of
[1:05:14] God praise the name of our Lord make
[1:05:17] sure that you have the new
[1:05:20] birth make sure that you have your
[1:05:23] possession in heaven
[1:05:26] praise the name of our Lord because
[1:05:28] these natural things are going to pass
[1:05:31] away they are so
[1:05:33] temporary it is a shadow of life and the
[1:05:37] Bible says it is a passing
[1:05:40] Shadow and when it's a passing Shadow
[1:05:43] you can't follow
[1:05:44] it but when you are born into the
[1:05:47] kingdom of God it brings a lot of
[1:05:50] joy and should also bring you
[1:05:53] Joy like that song we s it was a happy
[1:05:58] day praise the name of our Lord when
[1:06:01] Jesus redeemed me and you see when you
[1:06:04] have truly been born
[1:06:06] again the Bible says you find peace with
[1:06:11] God and that peace that God only can
[1:06:15] give you it brings you
[1:06:19] Joy Joy that I'm a Child of God joy that
[1:06:23] I'm born again
[1:06:25] joy that I have eternal life joy that
[1:06:28] I'm not my
[1:06:30] own joy that I'm of the
[1:06:32] Lord and regardless of what you going
[1:06:35] through maybe
[1:06:37] hards maybe trials or you don't have
[1:06:41] this or you lack this there is a
[1:06:44] satisfaction that comes in you that I
[1:06:48] belong to the Lord praise the name of
[1:06:50] our Lord and that should be something
[1:06:52] that keeps us going every day
[1:06:56] that I am not of my own but I am of God
[1:07:01] praise the name of our Lord he should
[1:07:02] give us
[1:07:04] joy now the Bible
[1:07:06] says John 16 ver
[1:07:14] 21 he
[1:07:17] says a woman when she is in travel has
[1:07:21] sorrow because her hour is come but as
[1:07:25] soon as she's delivered of the child she
[1:07:28] remember no more the anguish for joy
[1:07:32] that a man is Born Into the
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:50] world Amen now you see there is joy for
[1:07:54] the natural birth
[1:07:57] such great
[1:07:59] joy praise the name of our Lord you know
[1:08:02] it is something that people now start
[1:08:06] thinking now if they they have had no
[1:08:10] child said now we have a hair
[1:08:13] now we have somebody who is part of
[1:08:16] us and then you see some
[1:08:18] families when they don't have a
[1:08:23] child differences can rise up very
[1:08:28] fast and then In some
[1:08:32] cultures when the wife doesn't
[1:08:36] produce then they start choosing the
[1:08:41] wife some
[1:08:44] cures then
[1:08:50] others but that was not so with Zakaria
[1:08:53] and Elizabeth
[1:08:56] they aged
[1:08:58] together even without a
[1:09:01] child Zakaria
[1:09:04] fear and respected
[1:09:06] Elizabeth that much is not giving
[1:09:10] back she was his
[1:09:12] wife but then in some areas they look
[1:09:16] for substitutions
[1:09:21] immediately that was not
[1:09:24] Z praise the name of the Lord the Bible
[1:09:27] says they lived in
[1:09:31] righteousness they lived in
[1:09:33] Holiness and even in the fear of
[1:09:36] God praise the name of our Lord so when
[1:09:39] you get into
[1:09:42] marriage be
[1:09:44] ready for what will happen in
[1:09:46] it praise the name of our Lord not just
[1:09:50] looking if this one doesn't happen I
[1:09:52] will have plan B
[1:09:56] that was not zakar and
[1:09:58] Elizabeth they were committed to one
[1:10:02] another praise the name of our Lord they
[1:10:04] lived the righteous
[1:10:06] life they had the fear of God they were
[1:10:10] advanced in
[1:10:11] age and then they kept on praying kep on
[1:10:15] praying
[1:10:16] praying until God in his
[1:10:19] time unites
[1:10:23] us what puts us
[1:10:27] together for one another and now you
[1:10:30] should make sure that you know you live
[1:10:32] the lives that are we just need to be
[1:10:34] patient Elizabeth didn't go out neither
[1:10:38] did Zar one another and waited on the
[1:10:42] Lord praise the name of our Lord that
[1:10:45] the testimony of
[1:10:47] God can be with them praise the name of
[1:10:51] the Lord let us go to Philippians 3: 20
[1:10:54] phili
[1:11:00] Philippians
[1:11:03] 3:20 the Bible says for our conversation
[1:11:07] is in heaven from when also we look for
[1:11:10] the Savior
[1:11:20] Lord praise the name of our Lord he says
[1:11:23] our citizenship
[1:11:27] is in
[1:11:28] heaven praise the name of our Lord like
[1:11:32] now when you go to a place they ask
[1:11:35] where were you
[1:11:36] born I was born
[1:11:39] from which is the
[1:11:42] village which is the
[1:11:44] sub but
[1:11:46] then you identify that
[1:11:50] place you mention that
[1:11:53] place as your birth place
[1:11:57] but then the Bible
[1:11:59] saying our
[1:12:01] citizenship is in
[1:12:03] heaven now how can you be a citizen of
[1:12:07] heaven without being born
[1:12:11] there so then as we were born here on
[1:12:15] Earth we also need to be born in
[1:12:20] heaven and being born in
[1:12:23] heaven is being born by the Holy
[1:12:27] Spirit which comes from Heaven here on
[1:12:30] Earth you were born in the flesh and the
[1:12:34] Bible says that which is born of flesh
[1:12:36] is
[1:12:38] flesh and that's the first birth and
[1:12:41] that which is born of the
[1:12:43] spirit is Spirit that's the second ver
[1:12:47] so we also need to be born in heaven as
[1:12:51] we were born here on Earth we also need
[1:12:54] to be born in heaven then we can say our
[1:12:59] citizenship is in heaven but if you have
[1:13:02] never been born In
[1:13:04] Heaven There is no inheritance in
[1:13:07] Heaven until you are born in heaven
[1:13:11] that's when you get inheritance in
[1:13:14] heaven that's when you get possessions
[1:13:16] in
[1:13:17] heaven and now God is calling us to be
[1:13:22] born
[1:13:23] again Jesus told
[1:13:25] Nicodemus unless a man is born
[1:13:30] again that word
[1:13:33] again meant
[1:13:37] above let us go to John
[1:13:46] 3:3 John
[1:13:53] 3:3 the scripture says
[1:14:00] Jesus answered and said unto him V I say
[1:14:04] unto you except a man be born
[1:14:08] again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:14:20] God now that word again
[1:14:28] again is from
[1:14:32] above that's what he meant when you go
[1:14:36] back and follow the original
[1:14:40] translations it says unless a man is
[1:14:43] born from
[1:14:48] above so there is being born here on
[1:14:52] Earth and there also being born from
[1:14:55] from
[1:14:56] above now our first
[1:14:58] bir comes from the first
[1:15:02] Adam that which is born of flesh is
[1:15:05] flesh the First Corinthians chapter
[1:15:08] 15 the first
[1:15:14] man then the second
[1:15:18] man is the Lord From
[1:15:21] Above then he said as we have taken the
[1:15:25] ly
[1:15:26] body so we shall also take the
[1:15:29] Heavenly so now when we are born from
[1:15:33] Ab when we are born from
[1:15:36] Heaven because the second Lord the
[1:15:39] second
[1:15:40] man the second Adam is the Lord From
[1:15:44] Heaven so by Jesus Christ we are born of
[1:15:49] his
[1:15:50] Spirit praise the name of our Lord so
[1:15:53] then you are born again
[1:15:56] you are born from
[1:15:57] Heaven praise the name of our Lord so
[1:16:00] then the baptism of the holy
[1:16:02] spirit makes you to be born
[1:16:06] again and now when you are born
[1:16:09] again then you can
[1:16:11] testify my
[1:16:14] citizenship is in heaven praise the name
[1:16:17] of our Lord my citizenship is in
[1:16:20] heaven you look at
[1:16:22] Abraham God told him the country of your
[1:16:26] parents come to the land I'm going to
[1:16:28] show you and then the Bible says when
[1:16:32] Abraham reached
[1:16:33] Canan he was in
[1:16:36] Canan as a
[1:16:37] stranger yet God had given him that
[1:16:40] country but he knew in
[1:16:43] Canan he knew that being in Canan there
[1:16:46] was fine there was sickness there was
[1:16:50] death there were Wars so he looked for a
[1:16:56] he looked for a city who build and make
[1:17:01] his where there's no sickness where
[1:17:04] there's no sorrow where there's no death
[1:17:08] where there's no fing praise the name of
[1:17:10] our Lord and the Bible says he stayed in
[1:17:14] that country
[1:17:16] waiting praise the name of our Lord then
[1:17:19] even
[1:17:20] others Isaac came also looking for that
[1:17:25] then when jaob came there was fing in
[1:17:28] the
[1:17:29] land and then Jacob had to go to
[1:17:32] Egypt and when Jacob went to Egypt he
[1:17:35] met with pharaoh and Pharaoh asked him
[1:17:38] how old are you then he told
[1:17:41] Pharaoh the days of my
[1:17:45] prage can you imagine a person is 100
[1:17:48] and something like that that there are
[1:17:51] few days compared to my
[1:17:53] fathers so even Jacob
[1:17:57] knew this is not the
[1:17:59] land that we inherit
[1:18:02] forever so our
[1:18:04] inheritance is in Christ praise the name
[1:18:08] of our Lord and until we are born in
[1:18:11] Christ we can't receive that
[1:18:14] inheritance praise the name of our Lord
[1:18:16] the Bible says our inheritances in
[1:18:20] Christ let us go to Ephesians chapter 1
[1:18:25] praise the name of our
[1:18:28] Lord Ephesians chapter
[1:18:32] 1 and then we'll read in
[1:18:39] verse let us start from verse
[1:18:45] 11 in whom also we have obtained an
[1:18:49] inheritance being
[1:18:51] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:18:53] of him who works on things after the C
[1:18:56] of his own
[1:19:06] will praise the name of the Lord so
[1:19:08] until you are born in
[1:19:11] Christ by the New Birth by the B of the
[1:19:15] Holy Spirit you have no inheritance in
[1:19:19] but when you are born in him then you
[1:19:22] have inheritance in
[1:19:25] just like the natural
[1:19:26] way you don't go to your
[1:19:29] neighbor because he's having a
[1:19:32] lot and then you say neighbor now you're
[1:19:35] my
[1:19:38] father now I need my
[1:19:40] inheritance you don't do that it's until
[1:19:44] you are born in that
[1:19:46] family so even us until we are born from
[1:19:51] Christ that's when we can have an
[1:19:52] inheritance
[1:19:55] praise the name of I know Pastor was
[1:19:58] preaching here about the trees being
[1:20:04] intertwined now if you are on the tree
[1:20:07] of the
[1:20:09] devil you can't get inheritance from the
[1:20:12] Tree of
[1:20:14] Christ praise the name of our can't
[1:20:17] be so we need to be born in the kingdom
[1:20:20] of
[1:20:21] God to have
[1:20:23] inheritance from ch
[1:20:25] now the Bible says in verse 12 of
[1:20:28] Ephesians
[1:20:31] 1 that we should be to the praise of his
[1:20:35] glory who first trusted in
[1:20:47] Christ whom also you trusted after that
[1:20:51] you heard the word of Truth The Gospel
[1:20:54] of yourself salvation in whom also after
[1:20:56] that you believed you were sealed with
[1:20:59] the Holy Spirit of
[1:21:14] Promise praise the name of the Lord so
[1:21:17] he says when we
[1:21:21] believe and obedient to the gospel
[1:21:25] he seals you with the Holy Spirit of
[1:21:29] promise and then the Holy Spirit of
[1:21:32] Promise is the Hest of our
[1:21:37] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[1:21:40] purchased
[1:21:44] possession unto the praise of his
[1:21:48] glory he says he gives us the
[1:21:51] honest the down payment
[1:21:55] which is the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:21:58] declaring to
[1:21:59] us that there is more to
[1:22:02] come more of what Christ redeemed is
[1:22:06] coming but then the holy spirit gives us
[1:22:10] an
[1:22:11] assurance that we are his children gives
[1:22:15] us an
[1:22:16] assurance that we are not of our
[1:22:18] own but we are owned by
[1:22:21] God the Holy Ghost gives us an
[1:22:26] by sealing Our
[1:22:28] Lives praise the name of our Lord then
[1:22:31] we can say our citizenship is in
[1:22:34] heaven we are strangers here on Earth
[1:22:37] but we are not strangers in
[1:22:40] heaven we have been born in heaven
[1:22:43] praise the name of our Lord we have been
[1:22:45] born from
[1:22:46] above so when time on Earth is
[1:22:50] over the Bible says he has a body
[1:22:53] waiting
[1:22:55] praise the name of the Lord there is a
[1:22:57] body of
[1:22:58] theophany that when you leave this
[1:23:00] Natural Body you get into the body in
[1:23:04] heaven and now the Bible says the body
[1:23:08] in heaven is
[1:23:11] eternal so how can I know that my body
[1:23:13] is
[1:23:15] there when I receive the Holy Spirit
[1:23:19] identifies that there is a body waiting
[1:23:21] for that there is a waiting
[1:23:26] praise the name of our Lord I come to
[1:23:28] get to know about
[1:23:30] it that oh there is a body waiting for
[1:23:33] me praise the name of our Lord so we
[1:23:36] need to be born
[1:23:38] again be born of the Holy Spirit receive
[1:23:42] the spirit of Christ Living in you
[1:23:45] praise the name of our Lord let the Holy
[1:23:48] Ghost take over our
[1:23:50] lives that we don't live by our own
[1:23:53] selves
[1:23:55] but we live by the grace of
[1:23:58] God praise the name of our Lord and you
[1:24:00] know the holy spirit is not
[1:24:04] far praise the name of the Lord the holy
[1:24:07] spirit is not
[1:24:08] far you know the Bible says don't say
[1:24:13] who shall go in heaven to bring him down
[1:24:16] or who shall go down in hell to bring
[1:24:19] him up what does the Bible say in Romans
[1:24:23] chapter 10
[1:24:27] praise the name of our Lord Romans
[1:24:30] chapter
[1:24:32] 10 and then verse
[1:24:35] six but the righteousness which is of
[1:24:37] Faith speaks on this wise say not in
[1:24:40] thine heart who shall Ascend into heaven
[1:24:43] that is to bring Christ down from above
[1:25:00] or who shall descend into the deep that
[1:25:03] is to bring up Christ from the
[1:25:13] dead and what is
[1:25:16] Christ
[1:25:18] anointed which anointing the Holy
[1:25:22] Spirit praise the name of the Lord so
[1:25:24] don't say the Holy Ghost is in heaven
[1:25:27] the Holy Ghost is in hell I don't know
[1:25:30] where I can get the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:25:32] say like
[1:25:33] that praise the name of the Lord like
[1:25:36] some
[1:25:37] scenarios the devil can put in your
[1:25:40] mind you say now when are we going to
[1:25:43] have a
[1:25:45] convention you know when the convention
[1:25:48] comes that's when we get you know those
[1:25:50] anointed preachers
[1:25:54] don't in ging we no longer have
[1:25:57] conversions the Bible says don't say
[1:26:01] that praise the name of the Lord God I
[1:26:06] wish I was there the day of
[1:26:09] Pentecost I not know whether I have the
[1:26:11] Holy Ghost or not also be among there
[1:26:14] and I see the fire there and I I have
[1:26:17] the Holy Ghost the Bible says don't say
[1:26:20] like that so God I wish I was there in
[1:26:23] the days of
[1:26:25] brother and then I go in the prayer line
[1:26:28] then he says now you wanting the Holy
[1:26:30] Ghost I receive the Holy Ghost oh God I
[1:26:34] wish I was there the Bible says don't
[1:26:37] say like
[1:26:39] that praise the name of the Lord oh now
[1:26:42] they organizing another meeting it's
[1:26:45] going to
[1:26:47] be now I don't have
[1:26:49] transport I don't know what to do the
[1:26:52] Bible says don't
[1:26:54] like what does the Bible
[1:26:57] say verse
[1:26:59] seven rather verse eight but what sayth
[1:27:07] it the word is near
[1:27:11] thee even in thine mouth and in thine
[1:27:16] heart that is the word of
[1:27:21] fa which we preach
[1:27:24] how far is your mouth from
[1:27:27] you how far is your heart from
[1:27:30] you praise the name of our Lord now the
[1:27:35] Holy
[1:27:36] Spirit praise the name of our Lord
[1:27:38] started working on your
[1:27:42] life the day you accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:27:44] as your
[1:27:46] P you didn't accept Jesus as your
[1:27:50] savior by your own ability
[1:27:54] Bible says salvation is of the
[1:27:58] lord it's God that brought the preacher
[1:28:02] there the Bible
[1:28:04] says that
[1:28:07] Philip Philip let us go to
[1:28:14] acts acts chap 8 verse
[1:28:18] 26 and the angel of the Lord spoke un
[1:28:21] Philip saying arise and go to one the
[1:28:24] South and the way that goes down from
[1:28:27] Jerusalem to Gaza which is
[1:28:48] Desert and he arose and went and behold
[1:28:51] a man of ethopia a un of great Authority
[1:28:54] Under candas queen of ethopians who had
[1:28:57] charge over all her treasure had come to
[1:29:00] Jerusalem for to worship
[1:29:26] and was returning and sitting in his
[1:29:29] Chariot read ASAS the
[1:29:39] prophet spirit said unto Philip go near
[1:29:43] join thyself to this
[1:29:51] Chariot praise the name of the Lord who
[1:29:54] was telling Philip to go there the angel
[1:29:57] told him go when he saw the Chariot the
[1:30:00] Holy Spirit told Philip join that
[1:30:05] Chariot so it was the Holy
[1:30:08] Spirit that used philli to
[1:30:12] preach so even when you hear the word of
[1:30:16] God the Hest
[1:30:18] spirit that is speaking to you so how
[1:30:22] far is the holy ghost from you
[1:30:25] so he says don't go don't say who go in
[1:30:29] heaven to bring Christ down who go in
[1:30:32] hell to K him from down the holy spirit
[1:30:37] is the one that brings you to conviction
[1:30:39] of your
[1:30:41] sin the Holy Ghost is the one that gives
[1:30:44] you the
[1:30:46] ability to accept the Lord Jesus as your
[1:30:48] personal savior so how f is the Holy
[1:30:52] Ghost and the holy spirit is the one
[1:30:57] that justifies
[1:30:59] you it's the Holy Spirit the same holy
[1:31:03] spirit is the one that sanctifies
[1:31:08] you how far is the Holy Ghost you mean
[1:31:11] you stopped those things by your
[1:31:13] own it was the spirit of God giving you
[1:31:17] the
[1:31:18] ability to live those things so it has
[1:31:21] been the Holy Spirit working upon your
[1:31:25] life from the time you had the
[1:31:28] gospel and when you are going to
[1:31:32] destruction you turned your back away
[1:31:34] from the evil things and started going
[1:31:37] this direction it is the Hest spirit is
[1:31:41] the Holy Ghost working upon your life so
[1:31:44] don't just
[1:31:47] imagine he's so far from me no the thing
[1:31:51] you need to do is allow the
[1:31:55] spirit to continue doing his work in
[1:31:57] your life that's all you need to do
[1:32:01] surrendering yourself obeying the word
[1:32:04] you are obeying the Holy
[1:32:06] Spirit praise the name of our Lord and
[1:32:09] the more you
[1:32:10] surrender the more the Holy Ghost takes
[1:32:12] over your
[1:32:13] life the more you read the word of
[1:32:16] God more the Holy Ghost changes your
[1:32:21] thinking is the more the Holy Ghost
[1:32:23] changes your
[1:32:25] speech the more the Holy Ghost changes
[1:32:28] your
[1:32:29] confession and you find that you are
[1:32:32] completely
[1:32:34] changed even your life you
[1:32:37] live Romans chapter

[1:34:01] message on God's power of
[1:34:05] transformation it is the holy ghost that
[1:34:09] transforms
[1:34:11] us from a sinner to the righteous person
[1:34:15] you don't do it by
[1:34:17] yourself but you just yield
[1:34:20] yourself and then the Holy Ghost Works
[1:34:22] upon you

[1:34:39] from that wrong thing and start
[1:34:42] following that which is right what is
[1:34:44] happening you are being

[2:11:22] to enable us to observe this Lord
[2:11:26] supper you told us in your

[2:11:37] remembering the death of our Lord Jesus
[2:11:39] Christ and the
[2:11:41] resurrection for it is through the death
[2:11:43] of our Lord Jesus
[2:11:45] Christ that will receive eternal life
[2:11:49] and Lord you left us these ordinances

[2:12:15] going to
[2:12:17] use the unleavened
[2:12:19] bread the alar
[2:12:22] wine and then later on the foot
[2:12:25] washing that you may be with us through
[2:12:27] these processes father and bless us in
[2:12:30] such a special Lord for the obedience to
[2:12:33] your word we commit ourselves into your
[2:12:37] hands we pray that your purpose may be
[2:12:39] done
[2:12:41] Lord we love you and we thank you Father
[2:12:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus ask this
[2:12:47] amen am let us turn to our Bibles
[2:12:52] First Corinthians chapter
[2:12:58] 11 he says in verse
[2:13:02] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[2:13:05] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[2:13:09] Jesus the same night in which he was
[2:13:11] betro took bread and when he had given
[2:13:15] thanks he broke it and said take it this
[2:13:18] is my body which is broken for you
[2:13:21] this do in remembrance of
[2:13:48] me after the same manner also he took
[2:13:50] the the cup when he had sted saying this
[2:13:53] is the cup the New Testament in my blood
[2:13:57] this do you as often as you drink it in
[2:14:00] remembrance of
[2:14:15] me for as often as you eat this bread
[2:14:18] and drink this cup you do show the Lord
[2:14:21] is death till he
[2:14:30] come wherefor soever shall eat this
[2:14:33] bread and drink this cup of the Lord unw
[2:14:36] worthly shall be guilty of the body and
[2:14:39] of the blood of the Lord
[2:14:58] but a man examine himself and so let him
[2:15:01] eat of that bread and drink of that
[2:15:11] cup for he that eateth and drinketh and
[2:15:14] worthly eateth and drinketh domination
[2:15:17] of himself not Discerning the Lord's
[2:15:20] body
[2:15:31] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[2:15:33] among you and many
[2:15:44] Sleep God blessing of his word we may be
[2:15:48] seated praise the name of our Lord so
[2:15:51] tonight is a night we are going to
[2:15:53] observe the Lord
[2:15:57] supper and normally we use the
[2:15:59] unleavened
[2:16:03] bread you only get the FL of whe
[2:16:08] FL and then you mix
[2:16:12] it just with
[2:16:14] water and then you bake it you don't put
[2:16:18] there oil or any other thing
[2:16:21] and then for wine we get the alar
[2:16:25] wine now in the
[2:16:28] denominations they get maybe Tip Top
[2:16:33] bread which has living in
[2:16:38] it and then they get
[2:16:42] F now those don't present the things of
[2:16:47] Christ and we Des that we observe this
[2:16:50] every month
[2:16:53] but as the Lord gives us the grace we
[2:16:54] shall be doing
[2:16:57] that praise the name of alone and also
[2:17:00] just the same
[2:17:02] thing you first eat then you
[2:17:05] drink so they first
[2:17:08] ate then they drun so we have the bread
[2:17:11] here before us 11
[2:17:15] bread and we are going to see that we
[2:17:17] break
[2:17:19] it praise the name of
[2:17:21] not the secular things like for the
[2:17:25] Catholics but this one is
[2:17:28] broken the body of Christ was
[2:17:32] pierced praise the name of the Lord the
[2:17:34] body of Christ was
[2:17:37] bruised praise the name of our Lord and
[2:17:40] all these are symbols
[2:17:42] actually and now the Bible say we
[2:17:46] examine
[2:17:48] ourselves if you are worthy
[2:17:51] you know your personal
[2:17:53] walk are you worthy now if you find
[2:17:57] you're not
[2:17:58] worthy you can ask God for
[2:18:01] Mercy to make you Worthy on our own we
[2:18:04] are not
[2:18:06] worthy but we are only worthy by the
[2:18:08] blood of Jesus
[2:18:09] Christ and that's why now you bring the
[2:18:12] blood of Jesus
[2:18:13] Christ in your stuation to make you
[2:18:17] worthy now if somebody here who has
[2:18:21] never accepted the Lord Jesus as their
[2:18:23] personal
[2:18:26] savior he first needs to accept the Lord
[2:18:28] Jesus as their personal
[2:18:31] savior somebody has not been baptized in
[2:18:34] the name of Jesus
[2:18:36] Christ he also P to be baptized in the
[2:18:39] name of
[2:18:40] Jesus so if you find that you you have
[2:18:43] not accepted the Lord Jesus as your
[2:18:45] personal you've never been baptized in
[2:18:48] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:18:51] don't partake of it praise the name of
[2:18:54] the Lord because it's not just a
[2:18:56] religious fulfillment of a
[2:19:00] ceremony but we need to do it following
[2:19:03] the footsteps of the Lord Jesus
[2:19:06] Christ praise the name of our Lord so
