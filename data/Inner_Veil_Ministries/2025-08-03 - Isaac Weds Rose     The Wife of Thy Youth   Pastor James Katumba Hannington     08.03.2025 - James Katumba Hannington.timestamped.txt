[47:55] says drink Waters of out of thine own
[47:59] tting and running Waters out of thy own
[48:08] well let fountains be dispersed abroad
[48:13] and rivers of water in the
[48:23] streets let them be only thine and not
[48:26] The Strangers with
[48:33] thee Fountain be blessed and rejoice
[48:36] with the wife of thy
[48:38] [Music]
[48:44] youth let her be as the loving he and
[48:48] pleasant Ro let her breath satisfies all
[48:51] the time and be ravished always with her
[48:57] [Music]
[49:10] and Why th my son be ravished with a
[49:13] strange woman and embrace the bosom of a
[49:23] stranger God his word you may be seated
[49:28] praise the name of our Lord again I
[49:30] greet in the name of our Lord Jesus
[49:33] Christ all our visitors you're
[49:37] welcome from the different parts of the
[49:41] country be together with
[49:43] us praise the name of the Lord I just
[49:46] want take a period of
[49:49] time May within one
[49:51] hour then we shall be
[49:54] concluded praise the name of the Lord I
[49:57] want to talk about the wife of your
[50:01] youth the wife of your
[50:04] youth praise the name of the Lord like
[50:07] we see Isaac and
[50:09] Rose they are still in their
[50:13] youth praise the name of our Lord and
[50:16] then we know that in our
[50:19] country as long as you above 18
[50:23] years you can marry
[50:29] a girl can get a husband as long as they
[50:34] 18 and boy can get a wife as long as he
[50:41] 18 but you know our situation in our
[50:46] country or sometimes in the family that
[50:49] you coming
[50:50] from you may find that it's not wise to
[50:54] marry at that age
[50:58] sometimes at 18 you are still staying
[51:00] with your
[51:03] parents especially like a
[51:05] man and maybe around 18 you are still in
[51:10] school like maybe you're in senior five
[51:13] or senior four or senior
[51:17] six or maybe you have even just done a
[51:21] course and I remember some time ago last
[51:24] year
[51:26] then the Ministry of Health was coming
[51:28] up with a
[51:30] policy that they don't want to admit
[51:34] nurses who are still in teenage
[51:37] age because like when the mother is
[51:39] giving
[51:41] birth says who is this girl is going to
[51:43] help me to give
[51:46] bir so now you see that the time of
[51:51] marriage also matters a
[51:54] lot but in now deved
[51:57] countries like sometimes either in
[51:59] Europe or in the
[52:01] US at 16 years somebody can
[52:05] marry and then in some countries I think
[52:08] it was either portug some country in
[52:11] Europe one of the leaders was proposing
[52:13] to be 13
[52:17] years now the Bible is telling us about
[52:21] the wife of your
[52:24] youth it matters lot before God praise
[52:29] the name of Lord that you marry when you
[52:31] are still a
[52:34] youth when you are still a
[52:37] youth but then of course you don't say
[52:39] that you don't go to your
[52:42] parents I'm 18
[52:44] years I want to get a
[52:46] wife I want to get a husband because
[52:50] there are things that go with
[52:53] marriage you must have your own
[52:55] accommodation
[52:58] you know just like a man are you still
[53:01] staying with your
[53:02] parents now if you staying with your
[53:04] parents and then you are trying to
[53:06] befriend a young woman for
[53:10] marriage then they will take you not
[53:14] serious or perhaps you don't have any
[53:18] income you depend on the pocket of your
[53:23] parents and then you also want to marry
[53:26] hey how are you going to sustain this
[53:29] person you know so there are issues that
[53:32] come into
[53:33] play that make you ready for
[53:36] marriage praise the name of our Lord
[53:39] like sometime I was asking
[53:41] Isaac where
[53:45] stay then he told
[53:47] me of course he knew the time and the
[53:50] season of what he
[53:53] wanted praise the name of the Lord okay
[53:57] you have a job how much are you
[54:00] earning because when you marry they
[54:04] responsibilities that come along with
[54:08] it there are
[54:11] responsibilities which you can't run
[54:14] away when you
[54:16] Mar but you know we are living in times
[54:19] that are
[54:20] bad that
[54:24] husbands other than producing children
[54:28] they just their
[54:31] duties doesn't care whether the child is
[54:34] dressed doesn't care the child is
[54:38] treated doesn't care whether the food is
[54:40] at
[54:41] home they have
[54:44] excuses and then
[54:46] some you know there are some
[54:49] irresponsible people you
[54:51] get and then they can tell you I have
[54:53] six
[54:54] children are you sure
[54:57] said yes where is one one is in
[55:02] another
[55:05] another you ask them how are
[55:09] they that the woman went
[55:19] withed very
[55:22] irresponsible so they just leave it to
[55:25] the women who give
[55:28] bir or maybe to the parents of
[55:32] the and then you also get irresponsible
[55:38] girls they just a man and they want to
[55:40] go with a
[55:42] man just only one
[55:46] day you know so but marriage comes with
[55:51] responsibility and now here the Bible is
[55:53] telling us rejoice with the wife of thy
[56:00] youth praise the name of our Lord now my
[56:03] brother
[56:04] Isaac just as you told
[56:07] Rose only you until Jesus
[56:13] speaks let that be in your
[56:16] life even in the midst of challenges
[56:19] that may come along the
[56:21] way because every marriage there are
[56:25] challenges
[56:28] there
[56:29] are every marriage as long as we are
[56:32] still living in this
[56:34] life and we are still living here on
[56:37] this
[56:38] Earth TR
[56:41] come every marriage go through those
[56:45] challenges go through those
[56:47] trials but then the issue is how are you
[56:51] going to handle the challenges that
[56:54] come and that's what
[56:57] now praise the name of the Lord Adam had
[57:01] got a wife from
[57:03] God praise the name of the Lord he got a
[57:06] wife from
[57:07] God but now before Adam could know his
[57:12] wife the serpent knew the
[57:14] wife it was a
[57:17] challenge how didam handle that
[57:21] challenge he didn't go for the divorce
[57:27] but he was able to bear with
[57:30] her in her condition in order to redeem
[57:35] her praise the name of the Lord not only
[57:39] Adam we see even
[57:42] Abraham Abraham married his half
[57:45] [Applause]
[57:48] sister she was a daughter of the
[57:52] father but not the daughter of his
[57:54] mother
[57:58] half
[58:00] sister but they had a challenge in their
[58:05] home there was
[58:08] barness of course there were many
[58:11] daughters in the
[58:14] land praise the name
[58:16] of you know there are those who are real
[58:19] [Applause]
[58:22] FTI children
[58:27] Abraham didn't do first search of who is
[58:28] f
[58:33] not didn't do that but spent many years
[58:36] with
[58:38] Sarah faithful with
[58:40] her and until Abraham told
[58:44] go
[58:47] this is the one is going to be my
[58:50] hair in other words Abraham was ready to
[58:54] live with his wife
[58:57] or was living with his wife much as she
[59:00] was Buren and was not looking for receip
[59:04] from he didn't do
[59:06] that even Zar in Luke
[59:10] one let us go to Luke
[59:14] 1 praise the name of our Lord Luke
[59:17] chapter
[59:18] 1 and then in verse 5 the Bible says
[59:23] there was in the days of Herod the king
[59:25] of there a certain priest named
[59:28] Zacharias of the course of ABIA and his
[59:31] wife was of the daughters of Aaron her
[59:33] name was
[59:48] El and they were both righteous before
[59:51] God walking in all commandments and
[59:55] ordinances of the Lord
[1:00:08] blameless now the Bible says they were
[1:00:12] both
[1:00:14] righteous before God and now we like
[1:00:17] Isaac and
[1:00:19] Rose you've known one
[1:00:21] another because of the message of the
[1:00:24] hour you need to continue in the message
[1:00:27] of
[1:00:28] the
[1:00:30] leing
[1:00:33] blameless praise the name of the Lord
[1:00:35] that's what the Bible is telling us here
[1:00:38] Zaria and
[1:00:41] Elizabeth they were
[1:00:43] righteous before who before God nobody
[1:00:48] had
[1:00:50] hypocrisy praise the name of our Lord
[1:00:53] nobody was hiding anything from another
[1:00:57] but then you get in some
[1:00:59] scenarios when a man finds the wife is
[1:01:01] not giving
[1:01:02] [Applause]
[1:01:04] birth
[1:01:05] secretly gets another
[1:01:08] woman and some of them you find giving
[1:01:12] excuses you know we have a
[1:01:15] trip we have been called to go to
[1:01:19] Guru he gives an exes of his place of
[1:01:22] work to go hide with another woman
[1:01:27] but the Bible
[1:01:28] says
[1:01:30] Zaria and
[1:01:32] Elizabeth were
[1:01:34] righteous before God praise the name of
[1:01:38] our Lord they were righteous before God
[1:01:41] and that should be even in our
[1:01:44] marriages be righteous before God as a
[1:01:48] husband be righteous before God as a
[1:01:51] wife be righteous before God praise the
[1:01:55] name of
[1:01:56] and then you get some men when they get
[1:01:59] money they wanton lock
[1:02:02] themselves if they hear the wife is
[1:02:04] knocking they hide it very
[1:02:08] fast what are you
[1:02:13] hiding but the Bible says Zacharia and
[1:02:17] Elizabeth Elizabeth they were
[1:02:20] righteous before God in other words God
[1:02:25] had a true
[1:02:27] witness had a true
[1:02:30] testimony about their life as being
[1:02:32] righteous before God and even us as
[1:02:37] individuals we need to be
[1:02:39] righteous before God praise the name of
[1:02:42] the Lord not just pretending
[1:02:46] something you know there are some homes
[1:02:48] you go
[1:02:49] to when the husband and the wife don't
[1:02:53] [Applause]
[1:02:54] talk but when you go there they
[1:02:59] pretend and then the other other honey
[1:03:02] you
[1:03:04] bring but yet is not but
[1:03:13] bitterness they only become sweet when
[1:03:15] you are
[1:03:16] there when you go away
[1:03:25] so we need to see that we are righteous
[1:03:28] before
[1:03:30] God your personal
[1:03:32] life Let It Be upright before
[1:03:36] God and then you know there are some
[1:03:38] people who get challenges in their
[1:03:41] home and say if they do this I also do
[1:03:46] that but that's not
[1:03:49] right you as an
[1:03:52] individual you are accountable to God
[1:03:55] to do what is right regardless of what
[1:03:59] your wife is doing regardless of what
[1:04:02] your husband is doing you are required
[1:04:05] to do what is acceptable before
[1:04:08] God praise the name of our Lord so the
[1:04:11] Bible says they were righteous
[1:04:13] before walking in all the
[1:04:17] Commandments and the
[1:04:19] ordinances the Lord
[1:04:21] blameless praise the name of the Lord
[1:04:24] how we need our lives be like
[1:04:27] that whether you are married you are not
[1:04:31] married God requires us to be
[1:04:34] righteous God requires us to be
[1:04:37] blameless God requires us to be obedient
[1:04:40] to
[1:04:41] his praise the name of our Lord and if
[1:04:44] your marriage things are not the
[1:04:46] [Applause]
[1:04:47] best why do you fall with the the bad
[1:04:53] things you know there are some people
[1:04:56] who have excuses of not coming to church
[1:05:00] because of their wife or because of
[1:05:03] their
[1:05:04] husb you need to make your personal
[1:05:09] decision that if my wife disappoints me
[1:05:13] if my husband disappoints me I'm going
[1:05:16] to stay faithful to the
[1:05:18] Lord I'm not going to look around an
[1:05:23] alternative praise the name of our Lord
[1:05:25] I'm not going to get an
[1:05:27] EXC and because of the wife or because
[1:05:31] of the husband we need to walk
[1:05:36] blameless before the Lord praise the
[1:05:39] name of our Lord then the Bible says in
[1:05:42] verse
[1:05:42] S and they had no
[1:05:46] child because Elizabeth was
[1:05:49] B and they were
[1:05:51] both well stricken in years
[1:05:58] but
[1:05:59] Zar he didn't think of another
[1:06:01] [Applause]
[1:06:03] woman he knew this is what the Lord has
[1:06:06] given
[1:06:08] me and he was faithful to
[1:06:11] that praise the name of the Lord they
[1:06:14] had a problem at
[1:06:16] home the wife was not giving
[1:06:19] birth but what did Zakaria
[1:06:21] do the Bible say Zaria
[1:06:26] honestly prayed to the
[1:06:29] Lord
[1:06:31] verse3 but the angel said unto
[1:06:34] him fear not Zar fory
[1:06:40] prayer
[1:06:42] his and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear
[1:06:47] the a
[1:06:48] son shall call his
[1:06:51] name praise the name of our Lord they
[1:06:53] had the problem of barness
[1:06:56] but the
[1:06:57] solution is go to the CR of Heaven and
[1:07:01] Earth and so whatever challenge we have
[1:07:04] in
[1:07:05] our the solution is with
[1:07:08] God praise the name of our Lord you know
[1:07:18] zabeth praise the name of our Lord you
[1:07:21] know
[1:07:22] in I think over 10 years ago
[1:07:26] there was a witch a witch was called I'm
[1:07:29] forgetting the
[1:07:36] name and then find the voice to be a
[1:07:42] woman that was a
[1:07:45] man when he became
[1:07:47] sick he went the
[1:07:50] hospital when they checked him was a
[1:07:53] man they said no you made you belong to
[1:07:55] the
[1:07:56] [Applause]
[1:07:59] took off then again he went to another
[1:08:03] things
[1:08:04] were and then the whole town had
[1:08:09] that
[1:08:11] man and then the men were sending their
[1:08:14] wies to that
[1:08:17] woman some of them wanted to
[1:08:21] kill elizabethe didn't go to which
[1:08:24] doctor
[1:08:26] but she was
[1:08:28] faithful and she waited on the
[1:08:31] Lord praise the name of also another
[1:08:35] example
[1:08:37] Abraham also the wife was
[1:08:41] bured he was also stricken in
[1:08:45] age and
[1:08:48] then Sarah tells
[1:08:52] Abraham go with this mate
[1:08:57] but it was not in the mind of
[1:09:00] Abraham to marry
[1:09:04] guy but Sarah brought the
[1:09:08] solution and at the end of the day
[1:09:11] whatever Abraham
[1:09:13] did after sah told
[1:09:16] him was
[1:09:21] blamed this made here this born son here
[1:09:27] Abraham took the
[1:09:31] responsibility they were not able to
[1:09:33] wait on the timing of the
[1:09:37] Lord but the Lord had a
[1:09:40] season where they would give birth to
[1:09:43] Isaac so whatever challenge that comes
[1:09:46] in
[1:09:48] marriage put it before the
[1:09:51] Lord praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:09:54] go to Genesis
[1:09:57] chapter
[1:09:59] 26 praise the name of our
[1:10:01] Lord Brother Genesis chapter 19 chter
[1:10:04] 25:
[1:10:08] 19 and these are the generations of
[1:10:11] Isaac abam son
[1:10:18] AB Isaac was 40 years old when he took
[1:10:21] Rebecca to his wife the daughter of Beth
[1:10:24] the Syrian of par the sister to laan the
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:40] Syrian the Lord for his
[1:10:45] wife because she was
[1:10:49] Barren and the Lord was entreated of
[1:10:53] him and Rebecca his wife
[1:10:58] conceived now
[1:11:01] Isaac and Rebecca re
[1:11:07] was she was
[1:11:10] bar but
[1:11:12] Isaac didn't seek for
[1:11:15] alternative but the Bible says he
[1:11:18] entreated the
[1:11:20] Lord and said
[1:11:23] Lord make my wife
[1:11:25] give
[1:11:26] birth for 20
[1:11:30] years Rebecca was
[1:11:33] bur Isaac didn't seek an
[1:11:36] alternative and now you imagine these
[1:11:39] people they were very
[1:11:44] rich nowadays people produce many
[1:11:47] [Laughter]
[1:11:49] children of course not all of them
[1:11:52] because they have a lot of money
[1:11:55] I can afford a wife
[1:11:57] in in another
[1:12:00] in because he
[1:12:03] loed that was not in the mind of
[1:12:06] Isaac that was not in the mind of
[1:12:09] Abraham praise the name of and then
[1:12:12] again there are others who don't have
[1:12:15] anything but they are producing
[1:12:20] everywhere they just have one small
[1:12:23] room maybe a gr
[1:12:27] at night that's you know where the
[1:12:29] trouble comes
[1:12:32] from legs are under the
[1:12:35] bed the head is where legs
[1:12:40] are just
[1:12:44] continuously but they can't raise those
[1:12:48] children when the time for lunch
[1:12:52] comes the children are running to the
[1:12:54] neighbor's place
[1:12:56] because at told there is no
[1:12:58] food why do you produce what you can't
[1:13:02] ra others can't dress their
[1:13:05] children you get the children with
[1:13:10] TS and then the back
[1:13:15] is they can't raise their
[1:13:18] children but he
[1:13:20] producing and then the wife says
[1:13:25] I have produce oil from my stomach until
[1:13:28] some
[1:13:29] produce almost danger to kill
[1:13:34] them they don't
[1:13:36] care you get this kid is on
[1:13:39] breastfeeding also want
[1:13:41] breast and then the other one they have
[1:13:43] to cut on the and then she's
[1:13:51] pregant you see God say that you can't
[1:13:53] produce and multiply you produce what
[1:13:56] you can take care
[1:13:58] of not every year every year every year
[1:14:02] every
[1:14:04] year and you are just on a small piece
[1:14:06] of
[1:14:09] land you can't educate your children you
[1:14:12] can't take your children to to school
[1:14:15] you can't take your children to the
[1:14:17] hospital you can't dress your
[1:14:20] children then you get those are the
[1:14:22] children stealing people's things
[1:14:26] we need to be
[1:14:29] responsible praise the name of the Lord
[1:14:31] you know he didn't say that you alone
[1:14:33] produ and
[1:14:36] Fe and even the
[1:14:39] production even to
[1:14:41] give he didn't say every
[1:14:46] year
[1:14:48] no produce what you can
[1:14:51] raise praise the name of our Lord so
[1:14:55] Isaac entreated the
[1:14:57] Lord and the Lord had
[1:15:01] Isaac in every challenge in
[1:15:04] marriage you put it before the
[1:15:07] Lord praise the name of our Lord you
[1:15:09] learn to put it before the
[1:15:11] Lord and don't start picking things
[1:15:14] against one
[1:15:18] another praise the name of our Lord let
[1:15:21] us go to Mal chapter
[1:15:23] 2 and then verse
[1:15:27] 14 to verse
[1:15:29] 16 the Bible
[1:15:32] says yet you say wherefore because the
[1:15:35] Lord has been witness between thee and
[1:15:38] the wife of thy youth against whom thast
[1:15:41] de treacherously yet she is thy
[1:15:44] companion and the wife of thy Covenant
[1:15:58] so the Bible says she's a wife of thy
[1:16:04] Covenant a wife of
[1:16:08] your in words you
[1:16:12] agre like we've been here Isaac and Rose
[1:16:15] exchanging their marriage
[1:16:19] convenant know somebody was asking where
[1:16:22] do you get wedding in the Bible
[1:16:27] the Bible says there's a marriage
[1:16:28] convenant
[1:16:32] here praise the name of Lord even Jesus
[1:16:35] attending attended the
[1:16:37] wedding praise the name of our Lord so
[1:16:40] now the Bible says she's the wife of
[1:16:45] youren so you don't add
[1:16:49] another praise the name of the Lord and
[1:16:51] the Bible says the two shall become one
[1:16:56] flesh one flesh like Isaac and Rose they
[1:17:02] now one
[1:17:03] flesh praise the name of the Lord so you
[1:17:07] can't talk about
[1:17:08] Isaac and you don't Hur
[1:17:12] R you can't talk about
[1:17:15] Rose and then you are not hurting Isaac
[1:17:18] because they
[1:17:19] one and if you don't respect
[1:17:23] Rose then you're not resp in
[1:17:26] Isaac if you don't respect Isaac not
[1:17:29] respecting
[1:17:31] R because they are one now the Bible say
[1:17:35] she's the wife of your
[1:17:38] Covenant but now before she become she
[1:17:41] became the wife of
[1:17:43] youren she was your
[1:17:47] companion praise the name of that's why
[1:17:50] it is good to marry your friend
[1:17:56] it is good to marry your
[1:17:59] friend not saying that is it Love at
[1:18:02] sight or
[1:18:12] something you don't know who they are
[1:18:15] you don't know where they come from you
[1:18:16] don't know their
[1:18:18] walk you don't know how they
[1:18:22] Liv you say
[1:18:37] take you to a place say you're going to
[1:18:39] meet
[1:18:42] somebody and then they bring somebody
[1:18:45] this was a blind
[1:18:51] date says your companion
[1:18:56] there's an understanding which has to
[1:19:00] happen there must be a
[1:19:03] time you know of kind of you know
[1:19:08] friendship who is this person who is the
[1:19:11] other
[1:19:12] person praise the name of and I believe
[1:19:16] Isaac had good
[1:19:18] time when Rose was working in
[1:19:21] G rose comes to church but
[1:19:27] Isaac you know Isaac sits this and Ros
[1:19:30] was sitting the other
[1:19:34] side and he took
[1:19:38] courage that
[1:19:41] sister but Isaac had a soft
[1:19:45] Landing because Rose was a friend is a
[1:19:48] friend to
[1:19:52] Grace and Isaac is a friend to
[1:19:57] then you see the connection came
[1:20:01] [Laughter]
[1:20:05] there so Isaac would just go where and
[1:20:11] Grace but know he goes
[1:20:20] to yeah they were trying to make
[1:20:22] friendship
[1:20:26] can I talk to
[1:20:28] her and Grace was maybe a good
[1:20:34] consultant you know those days there
[1:20:36] were post
[1:20:38] Runners there were no phones you must
[1:20:41] have somebody from either that
[1:20:45] family
[1:20:47] brother they give you some
[1:20:50] information you know she goes to the
[1:20:52] well at 5:00
[1:20:57] so this one comes pretending to come and
[1:21:00] pick
[1:21:01] water but to talk to
[1:21:04] somebody you know
[1:21:08] even went at the time where the right
[1:21:12] the time when the right got to pick
[1:21:14] water and they had to be an exchange of
[1:21:17] words there had to be some kind of
[1:21:20] finding out the character of Rebecca
[1:21:25] you know Rebecca was a young girl but
[1:21:28] she had a
[1:21:31] character young
[1:21:33] girl this man is telling just give me to
[1:21:37] drink but she had the feeling for
[1:21:40] everything which was
[1:21:42] there said no after you drinking let me
[1:21:45] run and give these
[1:21:47] animals but those
[1:21:50] camels they drink tens and tens of
[1:21:52] liters
[1:22:01] and then you find that in some
[1:22:04] homes the wife or the husband will tell
[1:22:08] the wife or the other I don't want to
[1:22:11] see your people at my
[1:22:13] home no
[1:22:17] character but see Rebecca willing to to
[1:22:21] be that she's able
[1:22:24] to take the concern
[1:22:28] of right
[1:22:30] character praise the name of and then
[1:22:33] was like how the Lord has blessed me
[1:22:38] then I said please you have room at your
[1:22:41] home is there where we can put our
[1:22:44] animals don't mind there
[1:22:46] is and Rebecca how to tell her
[1:22:50] people but then nowadays you find a
[1:22:54] woman
[1:22:55] goes to a man's
[1:22:58] home without people
[1:23:02] KN I'm I'm married this
[1:23:05] way who gave you
[1:23:10] up like here we see Rose could not come
[1:23:14] by her
[1:23:15] own but she had to be
[1:23:19] given by her parents and that's the
[1:23:22] principle of the scriptures
[1:23:24] Even Adam had to receive from the
[1:23:28] Lord for you where did you receive
[1:23:31] from did you find in a
[1:23:34] disco know how to dance dancing
[1:23:39] stres going to be dancing all the
[1:23:45] time this one was actually in the beauty
[1:23:48] Pig
[1:23:55] are they going to keep them themselves
[1:23:56] as
[1:24:00] pige there's a man in
[1:24:03] Tunisia he went and married a
[1:24:06] woman and he spent about I think $30,000
[1:24:10] or something like
[1:24:13] that they they went with the woman at
[1:24:17] home and he didn't know or he didn't see
[1:24:22] well the the appearance of the woman was
[1:24:27] artificial
[1:24:29] fake now when she reached home and she
[1:24:32] removed all the
[1:24:35] makeup man was in
[1:24:38] shock said this is not the woman I
[1:24:42] married took her to
[1:24:45] cour foring
[1:24:49] him I don't the
[1:24:52] ended but he took her to
[1:24:55] this is the woman I married this is the
[1:24:58] woman I'm
[1:25:02] living you know those who like to put on
[1:25:04] what they are
[1:25:07] not can be try to be
[1:25:10] humble to
[1:25:12] be but they are
[1:25:15] fake but you've made the
[1:25:17] decision bear
[1:25:21] it so you have to be careful
[1:25:24] what decision you make
[1:25:27] for are you taking a fake
[1:25:31] thing taking genuine
[1:25:35] thing and then there was also another
[1:25:38] man he wanted to get wife but he knew
[1:25:42] the
[1:25:44] target so he pretended he he came with a
[1:25:47] car driving all the time he comes
[1:25:50] driving around where the woman
[1:25:52] was tells her you know
[1:25:55] until she
[1:25:56] accepted and the man takes
[1:25:59] her she conceives but when she was in
[1:26:02] the man's house she realized the man
[1:26:04] doesn't have
[1:26:06] anything
[1:26:09] but so there has to be a
[1:26:12] time praise the name of our Lord to know
[1:26:15] what kind of person you're
[1:26:17] going now in the world they have funny
[1:26:22] things bad things they say you first
[1:26:25] leave with
[1:26:27] her and you give her some probation
[1:26:32] period find out that's not
[1:26:37] Christian praise the name of the and
[1:26:39] then say after one year or two years
[1:26:41] then you can do
[1:26:42] wedding or you can do your go for
[1:26:46] introduction that is not
[1:26:48] Christian so the Bible is telling
[1:26:51] us that she has to be your companion
[1:26:56] and then you make youren with
[1:27:02] herse and did not make
[1:27:05] one yet he had the res of the
[1:27:10] spirit and wherefore one that he might
[1:27:14] seek a
[1:27:16] Godly therefore take it to your
[1:27:20] spirit and let none
[1:27:25] treacherously against the wife
[1:27:28] of so the Bible is
[1:27:31] emphasizing don't deal
[1:27:35] treacherously to the wife of your
[1:27:39] youth that's the scripture say don't
[1:27:42] deal
[1:27:44] treacherous take heed to your
[1:27:49] spirit take he to your
[1:27:51] spirit and noways what the devil has
[1:27:55] done with the advance of
[1:27:59] Technology you'll find that people are
[1:28:03] married husband and wife but one his her
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:10] spirit is not with the husband or the
[1:28:14] wife their spirit is not
[1:28:17] together
[1:28:19] one the spirit is in sports
[1:28:24] not with the
[1:28:25] wife another the spirit is on
[1:28:30] Facebook they can be friend Facebook
[1:28:32] much
[1:28:35] more there was a
[1:28:37] sister she said the
[1:28:40] husband loves the car more
[1:28:46] than the spirit was with the
[1:28:48] car not with the
[1:28:51] wife and then others the spirit with
[1:28:54] their
[1:28:56] work so marriage is a a hard thing at
[1:29:02] home the man finds joy at his place of
[1:29:06] work when you go the place of work
[1:29:10] everybody says this man is good is you
[1:29:13] go to the house
[1:29:16] trouble the spirit is not with the
[1:29:20] wife at
[1:29:21] work but during the time of
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:27] lock you can't
[1:29:31] go because they are
[1:29:33] locked you can't go to the
[1:29:36] gym can't go to
[1:29:40] the I wonder they
[1:29:42] wereing from morning to
[1:29:45] evening you're just
[1:29:50] there but the Bible says take he to your
[1:29:55] spirit because all the trouble comes
[1:29:57] from your
[1:29:59] spirit what is your mind about your
[1:30:02] wife what is your mind about your
[1:30:05] hus have you despised
[1:30:08] her like David he married s's
[1:30:12] daughter and when he married s's
[1:30:15] daughter a
[1:30:17] prince when she saw David dancing for
[1:30:20] the Ark of the Lord
[1:30:24] the Bible say she despised
[1:30:28] David her spirit was not together
[1:30:33] with and this is where the Tres come in
[1:30:35] a
[1:30:37] home when your spirit is not
[1:30:40] one the one spirit is
[1:30:43] on
[1:30:45] on you get trouble at
[1:30:48] home find something as a husband and
[1:30:52] wife as a husband and wife find
[1:30:56] something that can put you
[1:30:59] together that can make you rejoice
[1:31:02] together and the most important thing
[1:31:06] that can put you together is the word of
[1:31:09] God praise the name of our Lord when you
[1:31:12] bring the word of God in the midst of
[1:31:15] your
[1:31:16] differen you'll see those contr Spirits
[1:31:18] run
[1:31:20] away and then you'll have time for one
[1:31:22] another
[1:31:24] you learn to bear with one
[1:31:27] another you learn to pray for one
[1:31:30] another you learn you know to forgive
[1:31:32] one
[1:31:34] another you learn you know to see that
[1:31:36] you have
[1:31:39] compassion for one another
[1:31:43] compion praise the name of Lord this is
[1:31:46] mine this is my
[1:31:48] friend praise the name of our Lord let
[1:31:51] the word of God put together
[1:31:54] husband and wife praise the name of our
[1:31:58] Lord so if the word of God is in our
[1:32:00] midst then you're not going to deal
[1:32:04] treacherously
[1:32:06] treacherously this one is doing this you
[1:32:08] are thinking something wrong about and
[1:32:11] even your reaction will show that you
[1:32:13] are thinking something
[1:32:16] wrong they asking you for this but
[1:32:19] you're answering
[1:32:20] something what where are these things
[1:32:22] coming from
[1:32:26] so you need to see that your spirit is
[1:32:31] one let your spirit move as
[1:32:34] [Applause]
[1:32:35] one the of that your
[1:32:39] companionship
[1:32:41] continues and then you'll be able to
[1:32:45] keep
[1:32:47] youren as a husband and a wife but when
[1:32:51] your spirits are not together
[1:32:54] those evil spirits always make you think
[1:32:57] about somebody
[1:33:00] else about somebody El somebody
[1:33:05] else praise the name of our Lord but
[1:33:07] then the Bible says take
[1:33:11] he praise the name of the Lord take he
[1:33:14] to your
[1:33:15] spirit now in verse 16 for the Lord the
[1:33:20] god of Israel saith that he hateth
[1:33:23] putting away for one cover violence With
[1:33:26] His Garment sayi the Lord of hosts
[1:33:29] therefore take he to your spirit that
[1:33:32] youal
[1:33:35] [Applause]
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:47] not praise the name of our God says he
[1:33:50] hates divorce
[1:33:54] he hats putting
[1:33:56] away that's a
[1:33:58] scripture he made one for one praise the
[1:34:02] name of the Lord one for one not one for
[1:34:07] two one for one and to
[1:34:11] one praise the name of that's the
[1:34:14] mathematics of God 1
[1:34:17] oneals
[1:34:19] one but then some try to make it two
[1:34:25] when they at home when this one is in
[1:34:27] the sitting room doesn't want to go
[1:34:31] there pretend to be busy in the
[1:34:34] kitchen
[1:34:36] there because one is in
[1:34:40] the
[1:34:44] when when he is almost pretends to be
[1:34:47] going to the
[1:34:51] toil dodging
[1:34:54] and then you get
[1:34:57] others they live in the same house but
[1:35:00] they don't sleep in the same
[1:35:03] bedroom
[1:35:07] is they are breaking the equation of
[1:35:11] God they breaking
[1:35:13] it and then the other will try to
[1:35:15] befriend the
[1:35:18] children against the other
[1:35:21] one other tries to buy
[1:35:25] children from the other one but the
[1:35:28] Bible says God hats putting
[1:35:31] away and then he says why do you
[1:35:35] cover
[1:35:38] violence with your
[1:35:40] gar in other words there is a form of
[1:35:48] violence there is kind of
[1:35:52] anger there is bit

[1:36:12] pretend be righteous before the
[1:36:15] Lord praise the name of the Lord let us
[1:36:17] go to Ephesians
[1:36:21] 4:31 the Bible says
[1:36:24] let all

[1:36:28] wrath and anger and
[1:36:32] clamor and evil
[1:36:34] speaking be put away from you with all
[1:36:44] malice now you see as a husband or wife
[1:36:48] the Bible say

[1:38:28] compassion and
[1:38:31] tenderness and that love for one
[1:38:34] another in Mal 2
[1:38:37] ver read that part
[1:38:42] again he says yet you say
[1:38:48] wherefor and then see the Bible
[1:38:51] saying 2:4
[1:38:54] says
[1:38:56] wherefore because the
[1:38:59] Lord has been a
[1:39:02] witness between you and the wife of your
[1:39:07] youth that's what God is
[1:39:09] saying the first time you convinced
[1:39:13] her and then
[1:39:16] smiling God says I was a
[1:39:19] witness then you
[1:39:21] prepared I don't know inlaws are going
[1:39:24] to handle

[1:39:55] women and then they they they just don't
[1:39:58] go for the
[1:40:01] function God says I was a
[1:40:05] witness now these are maybe 20 years
[1:40:09] afterwards and God is asking what has
[1:40:12] happened from the time you married that
[1:40:16] right now you despise your wife right
[1:40:20] now you despise your

[1:40:34] marriage I was a witness says why now
[1:40:39] that you're dealing treacherously with

[1:47:08] something each man that is born
[1:47:12] again with the spirit of God in
[1:47:15] him is a
[1:47:20] cre now that shake you a little but that
[1:47:25] is the truth we are in the image of
[1:47:29] God God is a Creator that's the reason
[1:47:33] you can believe that God could heal a
[1:47:37] person because God is in you and God
[1:47:40] made this world he just spoke it and his
[1:47:45] word become
[1:47:47] material the very ground
[1:47:53] that you are setting
[1:47:54] on is the word of God made
[1:47:59] manifest if he
[1:48:01] didn't where where could he get
[1:48:06] it see he just spoke it and it turned
[1:48:10] into
[1:48:12] existence he believed his
[1:48:15] own and if a man is born of the spirit
[1:48:18] of
[1:48:19] God he's an offspring of God
[1:48:23] and the part of God is in him and he
[1:48:26] believes
[1:48:27] everyone that God
[1:48:30] says will
[1:48:33] materialize see and so that that makes
[1:48:37] him part of
[1:48:39] God the holy spirit in the man makes him
[1:48:43] a part
[1:48:44] of praise the name of God so when you
[1:48:47] are born again when the spirit of God
[1:48:50] dwells in you praise the name of
[1:48:53] it makes you a part of God you can
[1:48:56] forgive the way God
[1:48:57] forgives you can bear the way God bear
[1:49:00] you can have long suffering the God has
[1:49:03] long you can be gentle the way God is
[1:49:07] gentle you can be you know make the way
[1:49:11] the Lord is
[1:49:12] made and then he say and now did you
[1:49:16] ever see
[1:49:17] people nice people but you just couldn't
[1:49:21] hardly stand to be
[1:49:27] you don't have nothing against them but
[1:49:30] you can't stand to be
[1:49:33] around then you seen some
[1:49:36] people that all a little
[1:49:39] [Applause]
[1:49:44] old
[1:49:46] down but you just love to be around that
[1:49:50] person you just love
[1:49:54] somehow it is the
[1:49:57] atmosphere that they've got around
[1:50:00] them the way they live they create an
[1:50:05] atmosphere that you like to be
[1:50:08] into that's lovely people to be
[1:50:12] with that's how your family should be
[1:50:15] that's how your home should be lovely
[1:50:19] home you created an atmosphere
[1:50:23] where the holy spirit lules in your home
[1:50:27] praise the name of and that's what
[1:50:28] should be at our
[1:50:29] home
[1:50:31] forgiveness where there is
[1:50:34] repentance you know in a home where
[1:50:38] saying I'm sorry is not a hard
[1:50:42] thing praise the name of us because you
[1:50:45] have a feeling you want to be
[1:50:48] reconciled a home where are
[1:50:51] forgiving is not a problem
[1:50:54] praise the name of Lord a home where are
[1:50:56] feeling for one
[1:50:58] another is always the
[1:51:00] concern you know you are
[1:51:03] concerned just like this body the body
[1:51:06] has many
[1:51:07] parts praise the name of but if the
[1:51:11] leg knocks a
[1:51:13] stone and then there is one toe that is
[1:51:17] hard the whole body is moved to go to
[1:51:21] that toe
[1:51:23] the mouth will try to blow some air to
[1:51:25] make it
[1:51:28] cool then the fingers try to fill
[1:51:31] it the whole body
[1:51:34] reacts
[1:51:36] of that should be in our
[1:51:39] home praise the name of Lord if your
[1:51:41] husband is
[1:51:43] hot you are also hot see how best you
[1:51:46] can
[1:51:47] help praise the name of the Lord if your
[1:51:50] wife is hard also hard
[1:51:53] so then praise the name of the Bible
[1:51:56] says let us go and read the
[1:51:59] scripture Ephesians 5 as I try to
[1:52:04] finish Ephesians
[1:52:07] 529 he says for no man ever yet hated
[1:52:11] his own
[1:52:15] flesh but nourishes
[1:52:18] it and cherishes it even as the Lord
[1:52:23] Church why is he saying that because in
[1:52:26] verse 28 so old men to love their
[1:52:32] wiv their
[1:52:35] own he that love his
[1:52:39] wife
[1:52:40] himself praise the name of the wife of
[1:52:43] your
[1:52:44] youth she is part of you praise the name
[1:52:48] of our and then you get some men who
[1:52:51] married
[1:52:53] Queens after maybe 10 or
[1:52:56] years the man's AG is
[1:53:00] aging even the wife
[1:53:03] is but it say the wife is not fit for
[1:53:05] that
[1:53:07] place want to get a young
[1:53:10] one
[1:53:13] old praise the name of the
[1:53:16] Lord part of your body become Young
[1:53:24] the Bible says he that love his
[1:53:28] wife love
[1:53:30] himself so we need to see that we create
[1:53:32] an atmosphere
[1:53:35] of and love covers a m of
[1:53:40] sin praise the name of Lord I don't know
[1:53:42] what Rose likes
[1:53:44] eating praise the name of
[1:53:51] Lord and maybe Isaac fails to get them
[1:53:54] the whole
[1:53:56] month but you know ISAC maybe where they
[1:54:04] them that you know where to pick the
[1:54:07] best what she likes you know how to pick
[1:54:11] it you know how to get it you cherish
[1:54:15] her you make her
[1:54:18] happy not saying but you you are
[1:54:21] demanding too much
[1:54:23] you were too sck
[1:54:25] on but you got
[1:54:28] her part of
[1:54:31] you so you see that you seek to please
[1:54:33] one
[1:54:35] another you seek to do good to one
[1:54:38] another and the best you can praise the
[1:54:41] name of our Lord so the wife of your
[1:54:45] youth should be continuously your
[1:54:49] friend the Bible says she's the wife of
[1:54:52] your
[1:54:53] confidence see that you cherish her all
[1:54:57] the days of your life even in the midst
[1:55:00] of
[1:55:01] challenge there is God help in every
[1:55:04] challenge praise the name of our
[1:55:06] regardless of the condition
[1:55:09] ortion like maybe in some places like
[1:55:13] we've seen in scenarios in the
[1:55:15] scriptures where it was
[1:55:18] barness but then in some families
[1:55:21] poverty can
[1:55:24] come the husband loses the
[1:55:27] job the wife loses the job now if the
[1:55:30] wife married the man who is
[1:55:33] Rich look for another rich man to
[1:55:39] repl so they were not really committed
[1:55:41] to one
[1:55:43] another but they were committed to other
[1:55:45] things around these
[1:55:48] people but our marriage should be
[1:55:53] standing on the character of Jesus
[1:55:57] Christ amen praise the name of our the
[1:56:00] character of Jesus Christ should not win
[1:56:03] in our
[1:56:05] lives it should not disappear in our
[1:56:08] lives let the sweetness be there the
[1:56:12] sweetness of God the goodness of God the
[1:56:15] love of God
[1:56:18] tenderheartedness bearing with one
[1:56:19] another that's what the Lord wants you
[1:56:21] to
[1:56:22] the way you started as a youth he wants
[1:56:25] her to continuously be
[1:56:27] that the wife of your
[1:56:30] Youth and then you're not going to say
[1:56:33] those days were very
[1:56:35] good how about
[1:56:38] now praise the name of our who has
[1:56:40] changed it's only the time which has
[1:56:43] changed but she's still your wife your
[1:56:46] husband the love should
[1:56:49] continue kindness should continue
[1:56:53] one should continue that's what the Lord
[1:56:55] want praise the name of our Lord living
[1:56:58] with the wife of your
[1:57:01] youth praise the name of our Lord and
[1:57:03] may God always be in your

[1:57:08] atmosphere the fear of
[1:57:10] God praise the name of our don't be
[1:57:14] complaining there are people don't
[1:57:17] forgive they will tell you even
[1:57:18] something of 10 years
[1:57:22] for his
[1:57:24] forgiveness but God requires us to
[1:57:27] forgive from our
[1:57:30] hearts and the person who doesn't
[1:57:32] forgive you know the Bible says man who
[1:57:35] never
[1:57:37] forget they appointed
[1:57:41] tormentors to torment him and you know
[1:57:44] tormentors
[1:57:46] demons so if you don't
[1:57:49] forgive you have demons
[1:57:52] that's what the Bible says let us go and
[1:57:54] read that
[1:57:57] scripture praise the name of our Lord
[1:57:59] let us go to the Book of
[1:58:01] Matthew and then Verse 18 Matthew 18
[1:58:08] verse4 praise the name of our
[1:58:10] Lord let us start from verse
[1:58:15] 32 MTH
[1:58:19] 1832 then his Lord after he had called
[1:58:22] him said unto him oh th Wicked servant I
[1:58:27] forgive thee all that dat because
[1:58:42] me so if you don't forgive the Bible
[1:58:45] says you are
[1:58:49] wicked then he says though should not
[1:58:52] thou also have compassion on thy fellow
[1:58:56] servant even as I had p on

[1:59:10] Ro to the
[1:59:14] tormenters till he should pay all that
[1:59:17] was due to
[1:59:19] him so until you forgive
[1:59:22] the demon of will not leave
[1:59:25] you we need to create an
[1:59:28] atmosphere an Atmos of
