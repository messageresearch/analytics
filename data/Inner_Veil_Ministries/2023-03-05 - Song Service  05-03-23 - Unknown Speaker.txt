comes [Music] foreign [Music] he takes the glue that feels the life we glow for all this time when Jesus comes to stay amen let's give the Lord out of Praise when Jesus comes power is broken you are welcome to the house of the Lord this morning the house of worship the house of correction coming to his presence just our fellowship one with another amen as the Lord speaks to us this morning amen amen I know one thing he says you know he's the same yesterday today and forever what he did in the Bible days he's able to do now [Music] of the goodness of the Lord amen the Lord is so good amen he turns sorrow to Joy I choose it's a joy listening to a testimony but then it's really stressing when you are coming through to produce a testimony I've got my two grandkids I don't know where they are hey man I want you to look at them that's uh summer and Rule [Music] and Rima amen you see back home I call about five names before I can come to the right one yeah they are out in the Sunday school they are going to come a little bit but you know what happened is that what was that Mom was it Wednesday Tuesday it was Tuesday night and you see we who stay in the countryside you see we do a few things [Music] and it was you know necessary that they get fumigated and so we did that but there were two options the young man who works on the farm wanted to use the medicine we use on ticks and then my wife said no that's expensive paraffin can do the job we normally buy paraffin and keep it in the house because these kids use Pampers and they cannot get you know rotten I take dope you have to kind of set them on fire so then my wife gave him some paraffin that he was going to use on those uh red ants and then this younger man with your movocon around seven o'clock in the night just put the bottle by the door to go and get a pump and these two little kids were there let me let the people see them amen amen so you know whatever they do they do in unison if you give one something to eat he's going to share it with another and so they went for the boat of paraffin now foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so there was a lot of panicking the house you know and when we got on the main road it was seven o'clock and the roads were jammed I had to resort to hooting and got the wrong side of the road the people are so selfish they couldn't ask why this man is doing this [Music] so I had to transfer between Vehicles sometimes less than a foot this one less than a foot to the other side we came to a time when Faith couldn't hold us because she was literally dying she screamed she's dying she's dying [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and then they were not [Music] so immediately they were pressed on uh oxygen man we know about it and the one that was in the most terrible condition was Rima yes and then stayed on oxygen I think for about 20 hours or something to bring them back to life and we thank God that a day before yesterday they finished their treatment so after about 24 hours those kids were singing Jesus loves me [Applause] and so I stand here to praise God it wouldn't be Joy this morning if the Lord didn't stand with us it would not be judged so we really certainly thank God the god of Miracles the same yesterday today and forever amen amen somebody wrote a song amen the doctor said if they had mixed The Tick Poise there would be no chance there ought to be no chance don't you give thanks to God that's what the boy needed [Applause] but my wife gave something else he couldn't accomplish what he wanted so to God we give the glory amen amen so this morning uh brother James is going to minister but before we do sister Faith is going to give us a song Here of course thanking God for saving our daughter amen amen God is so good amen you can never measure his goodness amen amen you can't you know put it in some form of quantity this is the match that God is good amen Amina God bless you what is the faith as we're going to the Rapture Ready amen so we should always give thanks to God for the prayers we have for one another and I give thanks to God for your prayers I'm sorry uh for the way I sent the message but that's what I was at that time amen amen God is good God bless you foreign
