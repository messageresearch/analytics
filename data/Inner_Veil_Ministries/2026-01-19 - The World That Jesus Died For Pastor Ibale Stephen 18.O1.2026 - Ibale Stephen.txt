We should always give thanks to him &gt;&gt; for the grace that he has poured out unto us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] God bless. Oh bless you. There's no one great amongst [singing] us. We are nothing on our own. [singing] We make mistakes and no [singing] offense. [music] just come on flesh and [music and singing] bone. But someday I'll [singing] prove just why I say the town of a [singing] special kind. For [singing and music] when he was on the cross, I was [music and singing] on his mind for he knew me. Can't he love [singing and music] me? He whose [music and singing] glory flame the heaven [singing] shine. [music] Our so unworthy. unworthy. [music and singing] Oh, [singing] such [music] mercy. Oh, when he [music] was [singing] on the cross, I know I was on [singing and music] his mind. The [music and singing] look of love was on his face. The thorns were on his [singing and music] head. Blood [singing] was [music] on his scalro and it was [singing] stained and crimson red. And though his eyes were on the ground that day, my Lord looked [music] ahead in time [singing] [music] when he was on that [singing] cross. Oh, [screaming] [music] you are all his [singing] mine. [music] &gt;&gt; For [singing] he knew. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; My [singing] God knew me. He loved me. &gt;&gt; Oh [singing] yes. He loved me with his glory. [music] [singing] The [music] heaven [singing] shine. I was so unworthy. [singing] &gt;&gt; I [music] was not worthy. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, such mercy. [music] Oh, when [singing] he [music] was all right. Oh, I know. [music and singing] I was I was [screaming] worthy. &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; worthy. [singing] My Jesus loved me [singing] and he was on [singing] the cross. I know [music and singing] I was all. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Y I spent in vanity [singing] and pride caring not [music and singing] my Lord was crucified knowing [singing] not [music] it was for me He died [music and singing] [singing] [music] and grad. There [music] was mountain [singing] [music] [singing] [music] by [singing] God's word at last [music] my sin I Then I tremble [music and singing] at the door. See my [music] guilty destroying [singing] your [music] [singing] [singing] I know there was [singing] mountain [singing] [music] [singing] [music] by [music and singing] your everything. Now [music] I got the holy [singing] land my king. [music] Now [singing] my rocks are so good. [music] Oh [singing] God. Oh mighty Christmas [music] to you [singing and music] and so mighty [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh [singing] my love [music] that true salvation. Oh my god. [music and singing] Oh [singing] the [music] mighty God of the glories. [music and singing] Oh Lord your mercy was [music and singing] great. I am [music] my burden. [singing] My heart [music] and soul found [music] [singing] my [singing] body and selfarting. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's very wonderful. &gt;&gt; So we thank God for this morning. And uh you see when you think of Calvary that's where it began and it was finished. Are you together with me? That's where it began and it was finished. He just said it is finished. Amen. And then he never came back to the cross again. all that you have need of Calvary had [snorts] the solution. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there are certain things that we really need to understand because they are the core foundation of our redemption. things like redemption, things like atonement, the power of Calvary, those are great things for us. If they don't become the foundation of our faith, then we become our own foundation and we cannot make it that way. So, you are welcome to the house of the Lord, brother Richard. You are welcome. Amen. Our brother, you welcome from Buend. God bless you, brother Duncan. And everybody who's coming down. Amen. And our brother back there, you are going to go back and you are going to be on the bench. Amen. For those uh uh election cases and stuff. So let's just pray for the peace of our country. to us. We have got a kingdom. Amen. Amen. We are not establishing one. We have a kingdom and we are in that kingdom and we need to appreciate God for there is a form of satisfaction that once you are in Christ there is a form of satisfaction. Amen. Amen. So um today I want you to remember the words of Jesus Christ when he says remember I mean take heed you hear you see sometimes people hear things and they give them a slant. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But take heed. How are you here? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's stand up and get to John chapter 3 and verse 16. Very common scripture that we are going to deal with today. But before we read, let us have a word of prayer. Precious heavenly father, we give thanks and we give honor to you for the grace that you have poured unto us, &gt;&gt; father. Grace that's greater than all our mistakes and failures. The songwriter wrote and says, "Grace that's greater than our sin, the greater to solve the less. May you precious heavenly father take this time and help us to dig in into the promises of this hour that we may be anchored heavenly father and learn the purpose of the glory that we give to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. So John 3:16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. May the Lord add blessing the reading of his word and you may be seated. So um the scripture says for God so loved the world. &gt;&gt; So my subject this morning is the world that Jesus died for. &gt;&gt; The world that Jesus died for &gt;&gt; because he died for a known world. So God loved the world. Now not a world but the world, &gt;&gt; a specific world. So we are going to speak about the world that Jesus died for. He didn't die for this world. This world has its god and the god of this world blinds the people. Amen. So let us now establish the two worlds here the two kingdoms. So in Isaiah chapter 14 and verse 13 if the holy spirit can help us to grasp this. He says, "For thou hast said in thine heart." Now you know the prophet Isaiah, now a prophet is a discerner of the intents of the heart. So we see in the ministry of brother Brham, he would look into the hearts of the people. He would tell the intents of their hearts. Are you together with me? Amen. And so the prophet Isaiah is now discerning the heart of Lucifer. The cause of his fall and therefore the fall of the entire world was the condition of his heart. Amen. Amen. He said, "For thou has said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also. Amen. Upon the mouth of the congregation in the sides of the north. Now when he says, "I will also arise and sit upon the mouth of the congregation in the sides of the north who is because there was one that was high above all creation." And then Lucifer says, "I will also establish my throne." He says, "I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I sides of the north. We will be like THE MOST HIGH." So now Lucifer is establishing a competing kingdom, a different world from the world that we are talking about. So Satan built a parallel world system and that's what he wanted to trade. That's the one he wanted to trade. when he said to Jesus, "Bow before me and I'll give you all these cities." Amen. Amen. He has his head. And the prophet told about Satan's Eden. Now, this end of Satan, it is one that was created after the fall. I think let's visit the book of Genesis chapter 4 and look at the four. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, in Genesis 4:16, Cain went out from the presence of the Lord. He's no longer in the presence now. He has walked out from the presence and brought in the land of not in the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch. This Enoch is not the Enoch who went to the house. Amen. and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. Are you together with me? Now Cain has walked away from the presence of the Lord. But Adam and Eve, &gt;&gt; Amen. And they remain in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? But Cain who was a seed of the evil is now the condute. Amen. That the enemy is using to establish a parallel world system. Amen. So what does Satan do? Verse 18. And was called Ira. And Ira begat mel. Andel begat methusel. And begat lame. And lame took unto him two words. The beginning of the four. Polygamy is here right now. And the name of one was and the other was Zilla. and and under Jaba and was the father of such as dwelling tents and of such as half cattle and his brothers name was Jubel and he was the father of all of such as handled the harp and organ music in the church is ABOUT WORSHIP BUT THEN IN ADAM, IN KANE'S LIFE, the alternative world system BECAUSE THEY HAVE FALLEN THERE IS NO joy there. They needed music for entertainment. Are you together with me? Music on this other side is appreciation of redemption. Therefore, it is worship. But music on the other side is because they ARE A FALLEN WORLD. There is no peace in their hearts. There is no joy in their heart. They exercise music which is not worship appreciation to God. They say music as form of entertainment to create a temporary joy. Amen. Amen. So and verse 22 and Z saw bear tuberc instructor of every aton and the sister of chupocine was Nama. So we see manufacturing Amen came from among those people. Amen. because they are trying to build an end of comfort. Ours is coming. But the words of the devil is already here. And then Satan up on the mountain is telling Jesus, you worship me, I give you the cities. So listen friend, we are in this world but not of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in this WORLD BUT WE DON'T BELONG TO THESE CITIES. NO SIR, these cities here. They are the origin of another alternative world. A world that Jesus did die for. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? So there is a world &gt;&gt; that had been taken over by the devil, &gt;&gt; but was NOT FOR THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WORLD now that Jesus dies for you together with me. &gt;&gt; So on this other side, we see Satan establish his kingdom. But we know AS THE PASTOR PREACHED HERE the other day THAT THERE IS COMING A STORM CUT WITHOUT hand to destroy this kingdom. Amen. So we in this world but NOT OF THIS WORLD. DON'T TRY TO COPY THEIR lifestyle because we are different from them. When they put on short dresses, put on a long one. when they do tight ones do something which is comforting of this world because it's naked souls. Amen. They are naked souls. Amen. They don't care put on show sit in front of the priest. But when you are a child of God, YOU ARE COVERED LIKE THE BRIDE IS COVERED. YOU SIT WITH COMFORT. WE ARE NOT OF THIS WORLD. We cannot live like THIS WORLD. We are called out OF HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. SO, Satan built a power world system and they said he wanted to trade it WITH YOUR REDEMPTION. AMEN. AMEN. So now life in the DEVIL'S WORLD is an imitation. An imitation. Now let me tell you one thing. He knew that there is coming a new Jerusalem, a seat from above. He started building his own. Amen. Amen. GOD CREATED ADAM AND EVE. TO MULTIPLY. AND SO ALSO HIM, THE FALSE VINE, THE FALSE VIN ALSO sneaked himself into the right womb with the wrong seed and brought forth Cain, brought Adam into marriage. That was the desire of GOD THAT ADAM SHOULD be married. And then the promise for marriage was only given to Adam to to God. See, but outside in the world, we see these marriages, how miserable they are because they are not promised TO THEM. MARRIAGE was a promise to the seed to multiply. Are you together with me? So when you are A CHILD OF GOD, the only way we can know you are is when we look at what is the original and stand by that not going on in marriage simply because so and so is married. Amen. Amen. SO THE OTHER LIFE OF THAT WORLD is an impersonation. Where there's MUSIC FOR WORSHIP, I PLAY music for entertainment. Amen. Amen. So we are two specific worlds. But when God addresses us with salvation, he's speaking to a specific world. I want you to notice that he speaks to a specific one. So the only way you could be reborn is because you are a seed that came from God. The promise for rebirth is NOT TO THE WORLD IS TO THE WORLD THAT Jesus died for. Amen. Amen. SO YOU COME FROM GOD. YOU KNOW WHO you are. You are a seed CHIN FROM GOD. AND THAT SEED already has eternal life. Amen. BUT NOW THAT ETERNAL life is held in a form of darkness like A LIFE WAS COVERED BY DARKNESS IN GENESIS 1. SO THE PREACHING OF THE gospel is to that seed AND THAT PREACHING IS TO DECLARE THE LIGHT TO GET AWAY FROM THE SEA SO that the sea can become a manifested son of God. Let there be life. Amen. Amen. SO WE PREACHERS WE ARE NOT creating seed. NO SIR THE SEED IS ETERNAL AND IT HAS ETERNAL LIFE. that what our WORK IS IS TO DECLARE the gospel so that he can remove the darkness because we are not putting your names on the lamb's book of life. OUR NAMES WERE PUT ON the lamb's book OF LIFE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. Are you together with me? So I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHO YOU are and we ought to look at YOURSELVES from the area of election. Amen. The other WORLD OF THE FALSE VINE THAT'S NOT OUR IDENTITY. Why we could be born from a natural birth like a can everywhere? We are two different worlds. Are you together with me? You see, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SEED. I'm not talking about this veil here. Amen. Amen. I'm talking about the sin that comes from God predestinated and gets INTO A BODY OF FLESH and is conquered in A WORLD OF SIN. THAT'S THE ONLY WORLD JESUS COULD DIE FOR. HIS DEATH DOES NOT BENEFIT THE OTHER WORLD. IT ONLY BENEFITS OUR WORLD. THOSE WHO COME from God, &gt;&gt; I say take heed. How will you hear? &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; We are a world known by fornowledge and election. Are you together with You see THERE IS NO WAY ANOTHER PERSON from the fallen world can squeeze INTO THIS because this deals with life IS ABOUT ETERNAL LIFE. IT'S ABOUT SEED THAT COME FROM GOD. THERE IS NO WAY MY PREACHING, HOWEVER POWERFUL IT CAN BE, CAN TRANSFORM YOU FROM THE FALLEN WORLD INTO THIS. THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL IS TO SEEK AND TO FIND THAT WHICH WAS LOST. Are you TOGETHER WITH ME? THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL IS TO REDEEM and redemption. You are DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS here and finally is here. SO NOW YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT AND BRING IT BACK INTO THE original position. That's why we preach TO BRING YOU BACK BECAUSE YOU WERE TRAPPED in a world where you don't belong. Jesus says you are in this world but not of this world. So you have to learn how you hear. &gt;&gt; You don't listen TO THE GOSPEL. LIKE THE REST of them listen to this. No, your hearing is totally different. Your hearing is intended TO MAKE YOU IDENTIFY WHO YOU ARE. So now in Romans chapter 8 and verse 29 the Holy Spirit SAYS FOR WHOM he did for heing his seed now FOR WHOM HE DID FOR he also predestinate to conform to the image of HIS SON that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, WHOM HE DID, then he also called and whom he called them he also justified. And whom he justified, he also glorified. Now these scriptures here ARE SO SPECIAL. If you look at them, these scriptures are addressing US IN THE PAST TENSE. Are you together with me? HE SAYS THOSE WHOM HE DID FOR he also did PREDESTINATE to be conformed into the image of his son. Those whom before YOU HEAR he predestinated THEM TO COME into the image of his son ON THIS OTHER SIDE. SO THE JOURNEY of your redemption is to bring you from a world of DARKNESS THAT HAD COVERED your seed. Amen. Amen. And now it has to speak away that DARKNESS and then you begin TO GROW INTO the image OF HIS SON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT promise &gt;&gt; is only for those whom he did FOR &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. SO THAT HE MIGHT BE THE firstborn among many brethren, meaning that you may become his brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; So moreover predestinate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To them he also CALLED HE CALLS PREDESTINATED SEA AND WHOM HE CALLED THEM HE JUSTIFIED. AND WHOM HE JUSTIFIED HE SANCTIFY. IN THE BOSOM OF THE HOLY GHOST. SO THE WORK OF CHRIST IS TO A SPECIFIC PEOPLE that is too strong. But that's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So we are a WORLD THAT HAD FALLEN but kind seed doesn't fall. That's their nature. That's what they've always been and will always be. Our preaching can make them religious men but cannot make them that seat. Are you together with me? It can make them religiously but it cannot make them that predestinated sin BECAUSE REDEMPTION IS a binding back. Amen. it belonged to him BEFORE but the enemy became a squatter over that divine estate. So John 3:16 is to a specific world that already had eternal life. HOW CAN YOU REDEEM THAT which is not redeemable? It doesn't have eternal life. Praise the Lord. You see, listen here. In the Smania church, the prophet says, "So, I'm speaking to you to gain the confidence and the knowledge of who you are that your redemption is not a probability of your choice. Oh, now I decided, now I fail. Now I decide. You see what I mean? Listen now. Then here we are coming to a conclusion. as the eternal log of ghost. God, eternal logos was manifest in the son and in Jesus throughout the fullness of the godheaded body. And that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title son. Okay. Even so WE eternal in his thoughts in our turn become the many membered spoken word. manifest in flesh. THE SON WAS THE father manifest in flesh and got the name or the title of the son. AND WE ALSO THAT ARE ETERNAL in his THOUGHTS in our tongue become many members spoken WORD. SEE MANIFESTING FLESH. WE ARE A BODY OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Are you together WITH ME? AND THOSE ETERNAL THOUGHTS now manifest in flesh are sons of God. Even as we ARE SO CALLED, listen to what the prophet says here. WE DID NOT BECOME SEED BY THE REBIRTH. WE WERE SEED AND therefore were reborn. For only THE ELECT CAN be reborn. Praise the Lord. Because we WERE SE IS the reason we could be QUICKENED in name. There's nothing to quicken. How can you grow a stone? There's nothing in there to raise. We could be the same flesh, the same body, the same biology, but what matters is the seed at the center. That's what God deals with. THAT'S THE SEED THAT GOD TALKS TO. And the CONVERSION [screaming] is to that sea. We could all BE TAKEN for biological test and we are the same but we are not the same world by the CDG. So there MUST BE SOMETHING IN YOU TO QUICKEN. It's not your will that saves you. BUT GOD ACTIVATING your soul, but his sovereign grace. You don't just come and walk here. H my mom is not happy with me. Let me go sir. And you come here. You are not saved &gt;&gt; by your will. Your will does not save you. &gt;&gt; Your will. John 1:12. I think let us go there. He says, "But as many as received him received him, to them gave you power to become the sons of God, even to them that to them which believe on his name, which were born of blood, nor the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but God. Your will, you know, you can walk here. But redemption is something supernatural. &gt;&gt; John 113 is not receiving doctrinal TRUTH about Christ, BUT RATHER coming into union WITH HIM. RECEIVED HIM. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; So the male comes into union with the female to produce a life. Are you the bride of Christ? For you to produce that life, there must be an invisible union. Amen. Amen. So when he talks of dying, I mean when he talks of dying for the word, he's not talking about this world. He's talking ABOUT YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You are a different crowd. THAT'S WHY YOU DRESS DIFFERENT. That's why you believe different. THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T GO into places where EVERYBODY GOES because there IS SOMETHING IN YOU THAT KEEPS talking to you. Amen. That you are NOT SUPPOSED TO GO. YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. There is something WHICH IS YOUR SEED KING. ON THE INSIDE. IT GUIDES YOUR HUMAN spirit guides. AMEN. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED TO DO LIKE everybody else because your human spirit battles THE SPIRIT OF GOD. BUT YOU don't do them because on the inside there is a life WHICH SAYS NO. ARE you together with me? &gt;&gt; So now IN 1 JOHN 2:15, he says, "Love not the world." And yet the scripture says, "God so love the world." So these are two different words. The one Jesus loved which WE ARE PART OF BUT THEN LOVE NOT THE WORLD. THE OTHER world he did die for. Love not the WORLD NEITHER THE THINGS that constitute this world. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF ANY MAN LOVE THE WORLD, THE LOVE OF THE FATHER is not in him. &gt;&gt; So the world and the things that constitute this world will pass away. So don't love those things. DON'T SELL YOURSELF INTO THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. DON'T SELL YOURSELF IN THE POLITICS OF THIS WORLD. DON'T SELL YOURSELF IN THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THIS WORLD. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT KANE ESTABLISHED HAVE ANOTHER ED. But then John says don't love the feast THAT CONSTITUTE THE FALLEN [screaming] ONE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So now, brother Brennham says, &gt;&gt; the world here doesn't mean that the earth is typing doesn't mean that the earth. [laughter] The planet is going to pass away, but the WORLD cosmos cosmos, &gt;&gt; THE POLITICS, &gt;&gt; THE SINNERS, THE SYSTEMS, SIN, DISEASE, GERMS, EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG WILL PASS AWAY. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE SAYS LOVE NOT this world, it doesn't mean the earth. Amen. AMEN. WHERE WE ARE, THE MOUNTAINS, the rivers, the plantations. No, he's saying DON'T LAUGH THE THINGS THAT MAKE the earth wicked. &gt;&gt; THE FASHIONS, LOVE NOT THE WORLD AND THE THINGS THAT ARE in the world. So verse 16, HE SAYS, "FOR ALL THAT'S IN THE WORLD, THE LUST OF THE FLESH, the lust of THE EYES, AND THE pride of life is not of the father, but is of the world. The last of the eyes should have it. &gt;&gt; Noh. Praise the Lord. The pride of life. You deolve pride because you have attained a masters of degree. No, the pride of life. You know, you get pride because you got a new car. Remain the same. You &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the pride of life he says is not of the father but is of this world. You find a man lecturing about his car. You know this car here is different from these others you see. Okay they all Toyota but this one here has been upgraded now. He's trying to tell you I'm different. Don't compare me to you. He said the pride of life is not of Christ. So that type of character, the people that are composed in those things, they compete in fashions. He says, "Those are not the people that I died for. THE PEOPLE I DIED FOR, &gt;&gt; THEY GO IN THE WORLD AND THEY SAY, "WHAT does God want? HOW can I dress?" Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE CHILDREN GOD DIED FOR, &gt;&gt; they cannot even have a DEBATE ABOUT FASHION BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE COMPROMISED because they look to the BRIDE that come from heaven WAS ADORNED. AMEN. WAS NOT HALF NAKED. LOWER LEVELS TO SHOW SOME PRESS COMPROMISE BECAUSE SHE COMES from the father. He says those are the world that I die. HE DIED TO REDEEM YOU FROM THAT TO bring you into the nature of THE BRIDE. AND WHEN YOU GET YOUR CHILDREN RIGHT FROM YOUTH. YOU TRAIN THEM HOW TO BE MODERATE in their dressing. Don't start saying create the nature of the WORLD that Christ died for in your family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S NOT THE WORD CHRIST DIED FOR. HE died you know for his own world THAT DESCENDS FROM heaven adorned like the husband running for her husband. AMEN. BECAUSE THAT'S the only REASON why that Wow is in revelation. IT WAS REDEEMED. HE DIED FOR IT. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE THERE. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN BE here on earth WHILE YOU ARE UP THERE IN HEAVENLY PLACES is because he died for you. Some of these things are impossible. We cannot TEACH THEM INTO YOU. IT IS ABOUT BEING THE SEED. AMEN. THAT YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE and you have a love for the world. &gt;&gt; You put in an effort. Amen. Amen. LABOR to enter into your rest. Amen. Amen. Because the DOOR HAS BEEN OPEN. So now labor is just walking to and remain in it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So you know at the cross that's the world he redeemed. And you had the young people seeing here when he was dying on the cross I was on his mind. Cain was not in that mind. No sir, HE BROUGHT BACK ADAM'S REST that had sold their RIGHT by the devil. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE HE REDEEMS. Now you mean I can only sit and then I can be redeemed. If you sit and you are not reacting, amen to the voice of the mother eagle, then you are not an eagle. You see what I mean? If you are an eagle, you cannot sit quiet. AND THE MOTHER EGO IS calling you from the chicken back. When you preach like that, then the people will not respond to the word. No, even if you preach it, if they are not part of it, they are not part of it. KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU CAME FROM GOD and there will always BE A VOICE THAT SPEAKS to you. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE. HE CARES IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN." HALLELUJAH. HE WILL NOT LET YOU GO OFF LIKE THAT. NO SIR. BECAUSE HE SPEAKS TO YOU FROM THE ANGLE OF YOU BEING RESPONSIBLE OF YOU HEARING HIS VOICE OF YOU ANSWERING back to the man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Listen after he died, just after he died, he said, "It is finished. IT IS FINISHED. &gt;&gt; PETER [screaming] MAY HAVE ALL THESE kind of troubles, &gt;&gt; but when you are converted, &gt;&gt; help your brethren. Peter, I see your troubles, but when you are converted because I see your name in the Lamb's book of life. Are you together with him? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Peter had a LOT OF TROUBLES. &gt;&gt; BUT after he rose from the dead, Amen. The angel at the grave, he said, "Go and tell my DISCIPLES and Peter once a seed, always a seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no way you can become any seed. &gt;&gt; You'll always be a se. &gt;&gt; Redemption is election. &gt;&gt; To be restored back, you'll have such a love for the word. Amen. Amen. You have such a love for the word. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; You see because you are seed you elected you come from God. You cannot stay home when there is a meeting here those things identify who you are. Amen. Amen. You cannot be seed and you are putting on transparent things. Those things identify who you are. &gt;&gt; I'm a seed. I'm elected. But I love this world and the things that are in the world. No, &gt;&gt; take it. How you hear? He said, "It's finished." &gt;&gt; And I think I'll give you this wonderful scripture here in Hebrews chapter one. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; I do too. &gt;&gt; He says in Hebrews 3:1, Who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the by his power. When he had by himself packed our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majest. HE SAT DOWN. He had finished the work. BUT the old time priests, next time we shall talk about atonement, THE OLD TESTAMENT PRIESTS, THEY KEPT COMING back everywhere. They kept coming BACK EVERY YEAR. BUT THIS ONE he said it is finished and he sat. Amen. So this atonement does not expire like the old testament sacrifice that served forever. So when you are redeemed you are stepping it A FINISHED WORK. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU TOGETHER WITH ME? &gt;&gt; And the blood, the prophet says, is always before him. And therefore, he only can see you through that shed blood atonement. So this atonement shall never LOSE ITS POWER TILL THE last person IS SAVED TO SEE no that power under the blood will always be present. Are you together with me church? Amen. Amen. Now We spoke about the vines. God speaks to both of them because they are two worlds. These two worlds are represented in the teaching of Christ. He speaks to both vers. He prophesies to both V. He speaks to the first V and then later on he would say but I have one thing against you. That one was to the false vine. So when you get into the world, you have to know what fine you are and also recognize AND REALIZE YOUR promise church. The prophet says, I have been saying RIGHT ALONE THAT THERE ACTUALLY two churches. THOUGH THE SPIRIT speaks to both of them in each age, to both of them as though they were but one. Are you together WITH ME? HE SPEAKS TO BOTH of them. As though they were one. NO. SO WHEN THE WORD IS PREACHED, LOOK AT WHO YOU ARE AND TAKE CARE OF HOW WE HEAR. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He says these two worlds they are represented even in religion. Amen. YOU HAVE A TRUE VINE AND A FALSE VINE. THAT'S WHY HE SAYS THERE ARE THREE KINDS of believers in. So when you listen to the word, it will always be by what vine you are. You need to recognize as to what world you belong. When God speaks to the true vine, he speaks ATONEMENT and redemption. TO ATONE FOR YOUR SIN, redeem you. Amen. But to THE OTHER VINE, HE SPEAKS CONDEMNATION and judgment. So the vine he died for IS COVERED under his grace is under THE ATONEMENT. THEREFORE IT REPENTS. It grows and brings forth fruit. Amen. AMEN. BUT THE OTHER VINE MOVES further away from the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the world he died for. I want you to make a confession. Turn to your brother to your sister and say, "I am the world he died for. The devil doesn't want to hear that he didn't die for everybody BECAUSE WHEN HE DIED, HE said it is finished. Which means that the ATONEMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED. [screaming] THE REDEMPTION HAS BEEN DONE. SO THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN be redeemed and go to hell. WHEN YOU ARE REDEEMED, HE DOES ONE THING TO WORK ON YOU to make you into the image of his son. How can you go to hell with his life? So God speaks to both true and FALSE in every age. AND SUDDENLY HE THAT an ear that gets quickened. So all the teaching here the pastor is doing IS APPEALING TO HE THAT HAS AN EAR. AND HE THAT HAS AN EAR IS QUICKENED RESPONDS HIS VOICE. AND BECAUSE he has life, anything that has life grows. It grows. &gt;&gt; You see the people growing here. The addresses are getting higher up, higher up and going lower down. Signs of growth. He says, "But the other seed goes further away from the world." The more you preach, the shorter the dresses are, the tighter they become. Listen, &gt;&gt; he says a son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he's a son. THERE IS SOMETHING THAT BINDS HIM. He may BE HERE IN CHURCH BUT HE FEELS he cannot GO AWAY and he's in here. HE'S A SON OF GOD but you know HE TAKES A TIME SOMETIMES to break into the revelation that I'm a son of God. IN FACT, A LOT OF TRUE CHRISTIANS are like the story of the baby eagle that was hatched out and the head. You know that the eagle is a type of a true believer. So I I want to say something here. Brother Brham talks about the story of the mother eagle. The mother eagle had gone to feed and when he came back to the nest to count the eggs one was missing and he started hunting. He counted the days. He says, "If this egg was not eaten and taken by another strange bird in two weeks to hatch out, he started on a mission of looking for his little igllet. He would go over the chicken bar WINGS AND THE CHICKENS would scamper. They fear this big bird. Then he ended up in a certain area. And as usual, he would fly, [screaming] SCREAM, the mother's cry, [screaming] that's the kind of noise the igllet was making. And then the little chickens says, "We don't even understand this. There was brother. We don't understand it. It was in such a misery because he was eating what he was not supposed to eat. The chickens were comfortable scratching. But for him, he had clothes. When he scratches, he would dig deep. And deep down there, there was no food to pick. He suffered a lot. Then one day he had a familiar voice. [screaming] THEN HE SAID, &gt;&gt; he said, "Hey Junior, [screaming] YOU ARE UP THERE DOWN &gt;&gt; IN THE CHICKEN BARRIER." He said, HE SAYS, "NOW YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP HERE. HOW DO I DO IT?" THE MOTHER SAYS, "SPREAD YOUR WINGS." The man, THE LITTLE EAGLE SPREAD his wings. HE SAYS, "NOW, FLAP THEM." WHEN HE FLAPPED, HE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS A FOOT FROM THE GROUND. HE SAYS, "FLAP AGAIN. FLAP AGAIN. PUSH YOUR FEET HIGH. BEGIN TO S IN THE SKY. THE LITTLE EAGLE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS GOING AND GOING AND GOING, BUT FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD NOT REALIZED THERE WAS AN EGO. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; SO TODAY [screaming] COULD BE THE DAY THAT YOU REALIZE THAT indeed you are received GENOM AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN IN CHURCH TODAY. It changes YOUR ATTITUDE. THE WAY YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF, THE WAY YOU PARTICIPATE IN CHURCH IS BECAUSE YOU DISCOVER you an ego. It changes YOU COMPLETELY. YOU BEGIN TO PAY YOUR TAX. YOU BEGIN TO DRESS DIFFERENT. YOU REJOICE AT THE PREACHING OF THE WORD BECAUSE you realize who you are. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sometimes you are struggling as a son. But our strength will come from knowing who we are and allowing God to give us the flight instructions. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He wants to drop the seed and drop in there. Praise God. AMEN. IN YOUR GOOD GROUND, HE BEGINS TO FREE THAT SEED ON THE INSIDE WITH THE WORD AND THAT SEED begins to grow. The eyes OF REVELATION, THEY BREAK OPEN. And then because your eyes are open, THERE are certain things you begin to do that you never did before. Because you realize who you are. Amen. Amen. You are now born again. How are you born again? First Peter 1:23 He says, "Be born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by THE WORD OF GOD, WHICH liveth and abideth forever. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. IT IS THE WORD IN YOUR GOOD GROUND live and abideth. WHATEVER DROPS IN THERE, &gt;&gt; IT REMAINS IT HAS CERTAIN NUTRIENTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And then you BEGIN TO DEFORM IN THE END of those nutrients. AMEN. THEN AGAIN MORE COMES WITH DIFFERENT NUTRIENTS. YOU'RE GROWING THE ANGLE OF THOSE NUTRIENTS. YOU ARE GROWING dil because you've discovered who you are. So once THE ETERNAL SEED OF GOD'S WORD FALLS INTO THE GOOD GROUND, IT SURVIVES all nature of adversity. IT SURVIVE THE DARK AND COLD NIGHTS. IT SURVIVES. NOW THE COLD WINTERS IT SURVIVES THE WIRES [screaming] OF THE ENEMY. IT SURVIVES THE FALSE DOCTRINES BECAUSE SEED THE WORD WHICH IS IN THERE IS ETERNAL. The seed on this side feeding on the word. the word feeding on the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It gives you strength to come forth. And even as you GET OUT HERE, you have got the ability to testify that I'm a son of God. That's our desire. So the seed on the inside feeds on the word. &gt;&gt; The word is the mito and you in there you are the feminine. And as long as you keep feeding then you are having union with the bride groom himself. Amen. you begin to grow from one level to another level. And if you don't know, you no longer struggle over certain things, you just don't know how you overcame. talking about children of God. And the prophet says they may take time to realize who they are, but when they do and they feed on the word, it changes their destiny. Are you together? Amen. Amen. Now, let's talk about this prodigal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes when we are children, we do stupid things. They do stupid things and you don't even uh get upset because they are children. They break the cups. You know, my grandchildren tampered with my safe box and I can't open it. I can't open it. But they are children. They try to see grandpa does this and this thing opens. They are children. How many are children of God here? You do stupid things, but God doesn't throw you away. He wants to deal with that negative character. That's why the ministry is given to perfect the saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are children but imperfect. imperfect in a sense that you are not yet complete. There are certain things God still has to work on our lives. [snorts] Let's speak about this prodigal son who squandered his inheritance. You know, he was with his father and his father trained him and the boy was so good and he was raising his father's farm until it was top on the line and he came to a point and said, "Father, give me what belongs to. I want to go on the other side of the country and also raise my own. He's a son, &gt;&gt; but he's stupid. Stupid. We are children. Sometimes we think we can't be able to succeed even away from his presence. And then we miss our services. Sometimes we don't study. Sometimes we don't listen to the message. We are just being stupid. We think we have picked enough to take us through the journey. That's what this boy thought. Do you know why you do that? You are just being a stupid child. A wise child will always live in the presence of his father. How important it is to stay in that presence. Find a time study. If you can find time, you can pray. Even when you are walking, you can pray. When you remember things, put them right. Even when you're on the street, father forgive me. That's the way to live in his presence. But this boy, he says, well, I can as well live on my own. And he went and squandered his inheritance. There was no more fruit left. The fruit of the spirit was completely drained away. No testimony whatsoever was left in the life of that man. But the scripture says when he came to himself that's what I'm saying. Selfreization &gt;&gt; he came to himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know how far you've gone from the presence, but when you come to yourself, and I pray you come to yourself in this service, how far away have I gone from the presence? Because once a son, you are always a son. Because you are a son by a life and that life is eternal. &gt;&gt; So you need to come to yourself. &gt;&gt; That what THE SCRIPTURE SAYS when he came to himself. HE STARTED TO WALK AWAY from his backslide. HE HAD TO WALK. AND WHEN HE REACHED THERE, THE FATHER'S HEARTS WERE open to receive him back. I don't know how far YOU COULD HAVE GONE FROM THAT PRESENCE, BUT THE FATHER'S HEART WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN TO RECEIVE YOU BACK. AND WHEN YOU WALK BACK, THEN [screaming] YOU RECEIVE BACK the robe of righteousness. YOU RECEIVE BACK THE SHOES OF THE GOSPEL, THE RING OF AUTHORITY. HE RECEIVES YOU, LIFTS YOU TO PUT YOU BACK [screaming] IN THE POSITION OF a son &gt;&gt; because he said it is finished. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? SO I WANT YOU TO COME BACK IN WHO YOU ARE AS A SON. NEVER GET TRAPPED. AMEN. NEVER GET TRAPPED. AMEN. INTO A sense of self judgment that therefore there's nothing good in me. CAIN WAS TRAPPED IN A SELF JUDGMENT. HE SAYS THEREFORE WHOEVER SEES ME SHALL KILL ME. NO, WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THE FATHER, [screaming] HE WILL RECEIVE YOU. That's what you NEED TO DO. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Listen to what the the prophet says. He says, "The new birth is Christ is the revelation." God has revealed to you. This great mystery, a child, and that's A NEW BIRTH. NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions, the same things that he did making the word manifest. SO IF THE CHURCH ONLY KNEW its position, it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is. Know who you are. when he came to himself. &gt;&gt; The reason why you find yourself away from the presence is because you are not with yourself. &gt;&gt; Are you together with him? So I'm talking to the world he died for. &gt;&gt; You can stray, but the mother eagle never ceases to call. The good shepherd puts aside the 99 to look for you. When you are, you realize you are lost. When you are sheep, &gt;&gt; you realize [screaming] you are lost. &gt;&gt; And when the voice of the good shepherd speaks, &gt;&gt; don't resist. Come back to the father. Amen. So I want to visit THE ELECT so that they may know who they are and that they are the world God died for. WHEN YOU AN ELECT, FAITH will be resource from knowing who you ARE and believing who you are and opting to WALK AS A SON. AMEN. YOU TAKE THE FIRST STEP. SPREAD YOUR WINGS. SPREAD THEM. SWING. FLAP THEM. FLAP THEM. WHEN THE CALL FOR REPENTANCE IS DONE, don't you start fighting. FLAP YOUR WINGS and run back to the father. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to be certain of the father's love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the world he died for &gt;&gt; are the people that share in his gym. Those are the ones he died. You know when Eve FELL and was on the other side with the serpent Adam this way &gt;&gt; could not imagine losing her. She had he had to walk over and get his wife back. Are you together with me? SO WHILE REDEMPTION IS God going YOUR WAY TO PICK YOU BACK. SO WHEN THE LORD ALLOWS WE ARE going to deal with this THING ABOUT ATONEMENT and redemption. You don't redeem what you never own. You redeem that which is yours. WHEN HE CAME DOWN, HE COME TO REDEEM seed gener. And I ALWAYS TOLD YOU THE BOOK IS THE MIND of the writer. HALLELUJAH. WHEN HE DIED ON THE CROSS, I WAS ON HIS MIND. I was in his book. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So this THEY FULFILL GENESIS 1:28. They carry his IMAGE and they carry his LIKENESS but trapped under a fog. So he COMES AS THE LIGHT. HE SAYS, "I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD." WHEN YOU STEP INTO THAT PRESENCE, THEN THE FORM IS CLEARED BY THE LIGHT. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] THE LIGHT OF HIS WORD. YOU CANNOT COME UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE WORD AND THE FOG DOESN'T CLEAR. IT WILL CLEAR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And then you are GOING TO REALIZE THE LIKENESS AND THE IMAGE. YOU REALIZE YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. YOU REALIZE YOU COME FROM GOD AND YOU REALIZE YOU ARE RECORDED BOOK OF LIFE. AMEN. AND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LIVE HIS LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; you know, needs you back. &gt;&gt; Because he's building uh a new home for you. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, John 3:16 is to this particular world. not another. &gt;&gt; So to this, &gt;&gt; he gives them life. He gives. They don't go out there to take his life. He gives them as many as received it. He gives them his life. TO THEM HE GAVE POWER TO become sons of God. So to be sons OF GOD they've always been but he gives them power to manifest the sunship. He gives them power. They receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. No man walks away, I mean walks unto him to take life because IT'S HIM who gives it. It's an election of grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said take heed how you hear. You know what we've heard for so many generations as organizations taught makes us think that you have got enough power to go and take eternal life. And sometimes we think you get it from the the altar here. No, you come here because you realize you have that life. SO TO REDEEM MEANS TO GET BACK AND atonement is the removing OF SIN THAT SEPARATES YOU WITH YOUR GOD. YOU ARE TURNED. SO redemption means TO RECOVER FROM THE power of ANOTHER TO BUY BACK. REDEMPTION IS Christ freeing men from the dominion of the Mosaic LAW by the price OF HIS DEATH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SO AFTER HIS DEATH, HE SAYS IT'S FINISHED. SO LIFE CAN ONLY BE REDEEMED BY LIFE. The law could NOT REDEEM THEM. SO we are therefore redeemed AND THEN KEPT UNDER ATONEMENT by the BLOOD OF JESUS. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. WE ARE REDEEMED AND THEN WE KEEP UNDER ATONEMENT. BY THE BLOOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament atonement meant TO COVER to pitch like in the making of the ARK [screaming] that was pitched by T. Amen. To cover the natural holes which was in the gopher wood that could let in the WATER BECAUSE THE ARK OF NOAH was made by the go which WAS NOT TOO HEAVY AND FIND A PROBLEM TO FLOAT. BUT THAT WOOD had wall holes pores. SO IT WAS NECESSARY AND IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THEY COULD get the T so that they can completely COVER IT TO COVER THE HOLES. ARE YOU TOGETHER WITH ME? SO THAT MEANS THE GOPHER WOOD WAS REDEEMED FROM THE FOREST, SEPARATED and then atoned. Do you get that? Okay, let's go into the ark the message. the prophecies. Notice another thing that the word meant MEANING ATONEMENT WHEN IT SAID PITCH IT TIE IT or soak it with resin. It means to atone. Now the WORD PITCH MEANS TO ATONE. IN LEVITICUS, THE SAME WORD THAT was used for pitch in Genesis in Leviticus used as an ATONEMENT to make AN ATONEMENT. THE TONE IS TO STAND BETWEEN. AND THE pitch that was in THE GO WOOD IN THE ARK WAS TO KEEP OUT WAS TO ATONE THE BELIEVER FROM THE WRATH of the water. ATON, REDEEMED [screaming] FROM THE WORLD AND ATONED AWAY THE LIFE UNDER the blood. HALLELUJAH. TO COVER THE HOLES OF YOUR WEAKNESS, OF YOUR FAILURES. IT REQUIRES THE LIFE UNDER THE [screaming] BLOOD CREATOR. Praise the Lord. In the Old Testament, THE CHEMISTRY WAS THE ATONEMENT. BUT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT, THE ATONEMENT IS THE VERY LIFE OF CHRIST TO COME IN AND TAKE CARE OF OUR POWERS. The Holy Spirit comes to maintain your redemption. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO THE SPIRIT HIMSELF TAKES CARE of our humanity. Okay. In Hebrews, the book, not the Bible 7 part two, he says you'll appreciate that you love it. If you are a Christian to a place that sin to a place that sin would haunt you if you're a real Christian to a place that sin would haunt you till you couldn't do it. For the seed of God remains in you and he cannot sin. The Bible said once purged by the blood of Jesus, you have no more desire for sin. If you have a desire, your heart is not right with God. That's when you say, "Father of my son." Amen. He now says, "Now you will do wrong, but you don't do it willfully. YOU ARE TRAPPED and anything YOU ARE TRAPPED INTO SOMETHING that you don't mean to do is not seen yet because you repent the mean you see that you are doing wrong. You turn quickly and say I didn't mean to do that. YOU WILL SAY THAT ALL YOUR LIFE a man don't want to be. That's the reason that we are so STUPID AND SHOWING THAT DOWN HERE ON EARTH THAT THERE is a blood atonement for US all the time to keep us covered. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says when you do father have my support father wash ask for more to cover that power. Amen. Amen. So we are not saved today lost tomorrow. and saved again. We are saved once but [laughter] kept by the atonement. SAVED BY GRACE, [screaming] maintained by the blood. The blood is always there waiting for our confession. The life of the atonement keeps us under daily sacrifice. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me give you this quote. I'm trying to find where to finish. He says, "A sinner is a sinner. He does not commit sins. He's a sinner. That's his nature. But you, you are the one who sins because that's your not your nature. He says, "But the church commits a sin, does wrong, gets a wrong thought, wrong impression, makes scrapples, wobbles like a little child walking, trying to learn how to walk. We just don't know how to walk good yet because a little boy, BUT WE HAVE A HAND THAT REACHES DOWN, gets us to steady us. We have one hand which holds us to help us to stop staggering. That is your growth. Father, I used to stagger but now I don't stagger. Will you say that this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are A CHILD OF GOD. DON'T PUT A self condemnation ON YOU. DON'T SEEK TO STAY UNDER THE ATONEMENT. The blood is there for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why at every redemption the people were moved to worship because it's Christ who pitched their wickedness. Are you together with me? They worshiped because of the redemption. THEY HAD NO POWER TO redeem themselves. SO AT EVERY REDEMPTION, THE PEOPLE WORSHIPED. Look at Miriam and the women symbolic of the bride of Jesus Christ. AFTER THEY CROSSED OVER, they worshiped. Who are we to have brought Pharaoh to I mean drown under the water? They lift up their hands. Who am I? Who was a prostitute? Who am I? Who was a drunkard? Redemption produces worship. It produces worship. Are you together with me? If it was our work, brother Steven, you would start bragging. You see me? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; It takes away the requirement of worship for the atonement. We worship because who are we to walk above sin? Who are we that when we sin we can be forgiven? You see what I mean? Okay, let's go to Exodus here and see the worship of Miriam in Exodus 15 verse 20. And Miriam the prophetess the SISTER OF IRON TOOK a temporal in her hand and THE WOMEN WENT OUT AFTER HER. THE TEAM ROSE and with dances and answered them saying, "SING YOU TO THE LORD, FOR HE HAS triumphed [screaming] gloriously the host and HIS BROUGHT DOWN INTO THE SEA. ARE YOU TOGETHER WITH HALLELUJAH GLORIFY THE LORD? FOR I WAS A DRUNKER. SEE WHAT I AM. I WAS A WITCH AND SEE WHAT I AM. YOU LIFT UP YOUR HANDS AND SAY WHO AM I TO BE REDEEMED TODAY. So we will not wait for the doors TO OPEN BECAUSE WE ARE THANKFUL FOR the glory of redemption. Amen. And the bride in Revelation 5 WORSHIPED AFTER THE REVELATION OF ATONEMENT. AMEN. YOU SEE JOHN WORSHIPING BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN REDEEMED AND HE SAYS THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL THAT'S IN THERE HAD ME JOIN HIS NAME'S OF LIFE. THAT WAS REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? And then WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO REVELATION 15, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. They see, YOU KNOW, ALL the sea of glass mingled with fire. Only this one we shall read. Let's go to Revelation 15 verse two. Praise God. Redemption is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Is God recovering his seed deed? AND WHEN YOU REALIZE WHERE HE PICKED YOU FROM, THEN THE PRAISE, then the worship. IT'S NOT HE THAT RUNTH OR HE THAT WE BUT GOD WHO SHOWS MERCY THEN THE worship and the praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 15:2, "And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the name of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having hearts of God, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; They had overcome the antichrist. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. ALL THOSE THAT WERE REDEEMED and they sung the song of Moses, THE SERVANT OF GOD, THE SONG OF THE LAMB AND MARVELOUS AND THY WORKS. LORD GOD ALMIGHTY TRUE AND THY WAYS. Thou king of the sight. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. [screaming] THE SEA OF GLASS. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THIS IS THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PRESENT ALTAR WHERE THE SACRIFICE WAS LAID. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THESE PEOPLE HERE IS STANDING ON THE SEA OF GLASS. THANK GOD [screaming] FOR THAT. AND THEY GLORIFIED GOD. THEY SANG THE SONG OF MOSES. YOU SUNG THE SONG OF THE LAMB GLORIFYING [screaming] GOD FOR THE ATONEMENT. WON'T YOU WORSHIP HIM TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; WON'T YOU THANK HIM THAT YOU ARE REDEEMED? &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU TO BRING YOURSELF ON THE SEA OF GALILEE? IT IS THE HAND of grace. God bless you. God bless you. IS THE HAND OF GRACE THAT FINALLY BRINGS US AT THE SEA OF GALILE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND THE REFLECTION OF THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVAH BEING SEEN THROUGH YOU. YOUR POWER, your son, not by might, NOT BY POWER, NOT BY STRENGTH. God bless you. God bless you, brother Moses. you love him. That's the atonement THE WORLD that he DIED FOR. HE MAKES SURE THAT they'll make it. God bless you. [applause] Redeemed I love to proclaim it. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redeemed through his divine mercy. His chosen forever.
