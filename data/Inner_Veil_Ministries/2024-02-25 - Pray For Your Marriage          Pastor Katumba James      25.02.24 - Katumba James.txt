church is open to praise the name of our Lord you know don't be like Thomas you know something you desire happens when you're not in the service then you start wondering was it so so it's always good to be around whenever the Lord calls for a meeting praise the name of our Lord so on next Sunday is the first Sunday of the month so we are going to have the Lord's Supper so we come prepared for Services then immediately after the second service we have the Lord supper and we just want God to give us Grace to keep it doing like that praise the name of our Lord now today is the last Sunday of the month and we had always planned that we shall be having the married people's meeting in the afternoon and to today we have only one service praise the name of our Lord and you know there are some married people who miss the afternoon either deliberately or they are too busy so we just bring it down here now in the morning that we all share that praise the name of the Lord and I pray God gives us the grace praise the name of our Lord don't look at the negatives in your marriage don't look at the failures in somebody else's marriage because it is God who said it's not good for man to be alone praise the name of our Lord so that's why it is very important praise the name of our Lord so let us stand up and take our scriptures we are going to Genesis chapter 24 Genesis chapter 24 and then we want to read from verse 11 up to verse 14 so the scripture says and he made his camels to kneel down without the City by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good spe this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham behold I stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of men of the City come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I'll give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou Hast appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou Hast showed kindness unto my master God bless his word father we thank you again we've read your word it's only the holy spirit that can use this word to search our hearts and we pray you may even help us in every situation that we are in giving us Direction and guidance for the glory and honor of your name even for the stability of our families in the name of the Lord Jesus us amen you may be seated amen so by the grace of God I want to preach on the subject pray for your marriage pray for your marriage you may not be married pray for your marriage you may be going to get married pray for your marriage you may be married pray for your marriage you may be trying to run out of marriage pray for your marriage praise the name of our Lord each and every one of us pray for your marriage that's what we want to handle this morning praise the name of the Lord now in the message be not afraid he says that is what we ought to do you women pray for your husbands like that and you husbands pray for your wife too and now you children pray for your wayward parents too while we are doing this praise the name of Lord he says women pray for your husband husband pray for your wife then children pray for your parents then parents pray for your children praise the name of our Lord and then in the message the choosing of the Bride you better pray hard before you marry that girl I don't care how pretty she is the same thing to a man you know perhaps maybe you've got somebody you feel this one should be my wife this one should be my husband he says pray hard praise the name of our Lord you better pray hard and seek the will of the Lord praise the name of our Lord now in the message let me get it here the trumpet gives un sound uncertain sound he says any woman that's going to marry a man she's not certain of that man she would better leave him alone and any man that's going to marry a woman and not certain you better leave her alone you would better pray through on it until God gives you the answer and then what God joins together let no man put a but we we must first pray through praise the name of the Lord because it's a serious issue you know you need to pray pray when you are getting into marriage pray for the person you are going to marry even when you marry pray for your marriage praise the name of our Lord pray for your marriage you know the devil is always there praise the name of the lord the devil is always there and what the interest of the devil is is to always see how he puts you off either you are married he wants to put you off if you not married he wants to put you off so what Satan does he always seek things that are contrary to the word of God and he wants you to take that line of living contrary to the word of God if you are not married the devil will seek for you to be in fornication and he will try to make all kind of suggestions and you see this is the order of the day you know everywhere a lot of immorality you go mostly now on thiss of learning boyriend girlfriend boyfriendfriend when the insts are just opening then they call there is a precious ball you know kind of like a party for [Music] freshers those new ones and then now this poor boys and girls they also want to get excited go to the campus and then these continuing students they all excited to pick new ones from them and you know every time and then you go to some of these institions they have culture institutions also like we have and then there is different ones and they also have you know welcome parties and you know they put all this kind of things and if you not careful at these institutions every weekend you in parties if you're not careful this weekend next weekend the other weekend the weekend and some of these businessmen know the business people they know that University students students have money so they bring all Leisure things around those campuses HS [Music] dis all around but they are targeting you that's what the devil is doing so you see see that Satan is out there to see that he destroys you to see that he brings your testimony down to see that you don't have a true Christian Living Praise the name of our Lord and then maybe places of work and then you get a boss is interested in you if you don't do this no job there are no more ethics at places of work just don't care you know gets a young girl from the University institution tries to persuade her in some kind of thing and wants to make her his mistress somebody who can be there to any time he wants her you know so it is so evil it is so wicked and this is the order of the day that we're living in you know just so immoral so now you have to be careful and now in the message enticing Spirits he says now all things ought to be considered prayerfully first seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added I am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul they thinking their attitude will be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed so everything consider it prayerfully where you going to study from consider it prayerfully where you are going to live consider it prayerfully where you are going to rent why would you go and rent in the neighborhood where theyes you know prostitutes running around every time why would you want to to rent in a place where there is a bar why would you want to rent in a place where a lot of wickedness is done why so you need to consider everything prayerfully even your place of work you need to consider it prayerfully if your place of work is taking you from God then it is not worth praise the name of our lord it's not worth working there if is taking you away from God praise the name of our Lord so we need to consider everything prayerfully where you live you are the friends you have consider them prayerfully you know you just don't get somebody at school or somebody in the community and say now I'm going to take this person this person is going to be my friend you don't do that kind of thing you need to consider everything prayerfully because the devil is out there all the time seeking whom he may divine praise the name of our Lord he's seeking whom he made and maybe for you may be on some kind of free range stretch you are just saying ah let me do some relaxation here and then the devil takes a hold of you so we need to consider everything prayerfully praise the name of our Lord every decision you make in life find out is it okay is what I'm doing pleasing to the Lord is this the will of God in my life consider it prayerfully praise the name of our Lord if you not married pray for your marriage if you are praying Lord this time I want to marri pray for that seek the Lord that you may get the right person praise the name of our Lord you know you need to seek the Lord to get the the right person and when you get the right person and you are in marriage do the right thing praise the name of the Lord you don't say that all now is done now you've got you say I've got the right person you need to work out in your marriage to be good praise the name of our Lord you need to work out in your marriage to be good now let us Pi this scripture here praise the name of our Lord let me get it here Psalms 34 and then verse 14 the Bible says depart from Evil and do good seek peace and pursue it this is the principle now you want something good depart from evil and when you depart from Evil do good you want peace at home the Bible says seek it and when you find it pursue it you want a good home praise the name of seek it when you find it pursue it maintain it do good praise the name of you know like if you want to be well in your body you don't start biting your finger when you bite your finger what happens you feel the pain and now here the Bible tells us in Proverbs 11 Proverbs 11 and then verse 29 he that travels his own house shall inherit Wind And The Fool shall be servant to the wise of [Music] heart now the Bible says he that travels his own house you travel your own house you are the source of conflict at your house you are the source of accusations at your house you are the source of everything that's not pleasant so you are traveling your house and when you travel your house the Bible says you are going to inherit winds in other words you are breaking your home you are going to lose your home you are going to lose your marriage why because you are traveling it so then you need to make sure that you don't do things that are not right you don't do things that are not appropriate praise the name of our Lord now when we continue in Proverbs 24:3 he says through wisdom is a house builded and by understanding it is established he says through wisdom a house is built and by understanding it is established so it is a process you take time to build your house take time to establish your house maintaining it cherishing it working upon it now start asking yourself if things are not the best at home what is my contribution to the mess what have I done to bring that find out yourself ask yourself why are we in this mess you just didn't wake up one morning and everything is bad but there is something gradually that has been shifting from good to bad so then you take responsibility and find out where has this happened what has caused this kind of problem and then you see that in homes it can start from something small and then it brings a complex you know something which is not understood well and then people start living by those kind of Tes the husband is decide and the wife is decid but something small praise the name of our Lord there some homes you go to the husband doesn't talk to the wife the wife doesn't talk to the husband but it's when they get a vist that's when they can sit together and then they come then they start asking what's wrong when the visitor goes end of the conversation wondering very strange during the time of Corona it was tough no visitors everybody was scared of Corona and then you find the children are in the house the husband is at home the wife is at home then you see the complex but we shouldn't allow things to reach that kind of extent praise the name of our Lord God has given you a house God has given you a family God has given you a marriage see that you build it see that you establish it and don't be the pillar where the marriage collapses don't be that pillar where the marriage fails don't be that pillar where the marriage becomes detest you know there are some people they experiencing marriage bitterness when you talk about husband tell me when you talk about a wife don't tell me don't tell me there's something wrong with you and in your home you need to build your house you need to build your marriage praise the name of our Lord now when when people are getting into marriage it is always an excitement like when we look at the marriage in Revelations 19 verse let us go there Revelations 197 the scripture says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready so the Bible is telling us be glad Rejoice give honor to him marriage always brings happiness in homes from the the where the wife is coming where the husband is coming it always brings joy and the institution of marriage God made it that it can bring joy can bring peace can bring Glad Tidings praise the name of our Lord and you know many times when you have a friend and then the friend maybe gets a spouse or or somebody is going to marry they always want to tell you this is what's happening and you know you can even can find Joy all over their faces excitement if you make a program with them and then the spouse makes a program with them the fian they will even forget your program because the mind is the other side you know there is an excitement into marriage and yet the Bible says let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lers come and marriage brings that kind of you know happiness that kind of contentment you know you see when somebody is not married they always working out to reach that marriage until they said this is the day of my life don't spoil my day you know they take it a special day the day that I married the day that I was wed the day that I got a husband the day that I got a wife it a happy day praise the name of our Lord but then now down the road we are asking why is that Joy why is that happiness down along the road what has happen praise the name of our Lord now in Psalms 19 praise the name of our Lord and then we read in verse five the Bible says which is as the bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoicing as a strong man to run the rest Psalms 19 verse [Music] now the Bible says when the bridegroom is coming out of his chamber he rejoices because he's going to get the bright what a day praise the name of the Lord like last year we had a lot of weddings and then you know they bring them they inside there they waiting they are waiting and then they say now you come in everybody wants you that they are strong move forward really exciting start looking at the time when is the bride coming who is going to bring the bride you know like sometime maybe the parents of the Bride are saying no those have not cleared everything and then negotiations go please we have prepared everything and now when they say she has come somebody says we are happy now there is Joy praise the name of our Lord and now God expects you to keep that joy in your marriage to keep that happiness in your marriage like a young man remember the day when you proposed to her and then she said I accept you how you felt I'm the only man in the world and she also felt I'm the only woman in the world what about now praise the name of the Lord what about now why do you think there are other men why do you think there are other women when you at that time you felt you are the only one I'm the special person and then they write the new bride in the town or the new couple in the town work out your marriage to be pleasant if you are not interested in your marriage nobody will praise it take care of your marriage cherish your marriage pray for your marriage praise the name of our Lord pray for your marriage now the Bible says he that find a wife find a good thing that's what the Bible says he that findeth a wife in Proverbs 1822 provers 1822 whoever find a wife find a good thing and obtains favor of the Lord so my question is where has the good thing gone praise the name of Lord what has happened that the good has become bad why because the Bible says when you find a wife you find a good thing and then you obtain favor now how how do you say to me it's not good to me there is no peace where is the favor of God in your marriage why is it praise the name of our Lord so then you need to find out where where did the problem come from and then you look on your side not again pointing the finger at the other one What contributions have I made to make my marriage hard to make my marriage difficult to make my marriage not work out to make my home unpleasant you know if you are the kind of person where at home you have no peace there's something wrong but you need to have peace at home whereby any time you are happy to be at home and that is the responsibility of both the husband and the wife the wife to make sure that the husband is happy to be at home the wife the the the wife to make sure that the husband is happy to be at home the wife to make sure that my husband is happy to be at home but now if these things at home only take their sleep there's something wrong you find it easy to associate with other people more than your husband or your wife there is something wrong with you you need to see that you made your marriage you need to build your house you need to work out to make it successful and every family every marriage has got challenges don't challenges you don't know what happening how they come yeah find out how did they come there praise the name of our Lord let us look at one marriage here the marriage of Isaac and Rebecca praise the name of our Lord let us go to Genesis chapter 25 Genesis chapter 25 and then verse 19 the Bible says and this are the generations of Isaac Abraham's son Abraham begot Isaac and Isaac was 40 years old when when he took Rebecca to wife the daughter of Beth the Syrian padanam the sister of Laban the Syrian they married at 40 years Isaac got a wife they spent 20 years without a child 20 years without a child that's what the Bible says here when you read in verse 26 and after that came his brother out and his head hold on esa's heel and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was three score years old when he bear them 20 years no child crying no child crying and you know we have some cultures when the wife is not giving birth and they make sure they put pressure on the man put pressure on the man to get another one but we have Bible examples here look at Zaria and Elizabeth how old they took without a child but Zakaria was faithful that he stood with his wife elizabethe so every home they have varying challenges but when you get a challenge what do you do how do you handle it look at Isaac when Rebecca was not giving birth so many years not giving birth the Bible says that Isaac in chapter 25 verse 21 in Genesis and Isaac ENT the Lord for his wife because she was baren and the Lord was inated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived praise the name of the Lord he entreated now the question is you how much time have you put in seeking the Lord to help in your problem how many times have you brought it before the Lord Lord this is our station the challenge at home may not be barness your challenge at home may not be being baren maybe your challenge at home maybe that you don't have sufficient income you challenge at home maybe you don't have your own house you challenge at home maybe that you live in a place that's not pleasant take it together to the Lord Lord this is our challenge Lord this is our need and then you petition God about that issue and then you don't start blaming the other one for not giving birth you blame your wife blame your husband no put it to the Lord in prayer and learn to be supportive of each other you know there are people who are com the man is already the wife is already Hur and then you keep on hurting her you keep on hurting him maybe she's not giving birth then you hurt her you why did I bring you my house you you're wasting my time that's not right all the man is struggling to get jobs you you man why is the other house doing well you man why haven't you got this that's not the way to do it do everything in love and consideration learn to be supportive of the other praise the name of our Lord but you see there are some groups people got to and then they get advice from their friends you better go this time without greeting her without smiling and you handle that issue how you handle it Isaac didn't do such a kind of you Rebecca did we pay a lot of you were here wasting no Isaac went to prayers in the Lord you need to pray for your marriage praise the name of our Lord he entreated the Lord 20 years waiting for the church how long have you waited praise the name of our Lord how long have you waited why don't you learn to pray over distractions that your we lift this condition you are more than able to change the circumstances we are in you are more than able to change the the suffering we are going through more than to change this kind of pray for your marriage praise the name of our Lord and now when I when Rebecca conceived and then the children started struggling in the womb and then she felt discomfort now Rebecca didn't go to which doctors he didn't go there praise the name of our Lord and then in verse 22 and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the [Music] Lord praise the name of our Lord what a Praying family this was we need to be praying families every challenge you get take it to the Lord praise the name of learn to pray for your learn to pray for your husband learn to pray for your wife now before you are choosing have you brought you to the Lord and then you said Lord now my husband is like this like this like this Lord now my wife is like this like this and you know God says I was a witness the day you started moving out I was a witness when you came and said thank you Lord for my wife thank you Lord for my husband oh I'm so happy happen now God says I was a witness the wife of your youth now years have gone God is asking what has happened why are you Tre why are you so Tre you don't want to do your responsibility you don't want to do what is meant to be done why are you breaking your house why are you traveling your house why do you want to inherit win praise the name of the Lord so you need to work out on your marriage Take Your Role take your responsibility even in the midst of whatever challenge you have bring it to the Lord in prayer praise the name of our Lord now for those who are married let me say this there is no better wife than what you have let us say amen yeah I wish we had set husband sit with the wife praise the name of I'm trying to do some scan praise the name of Lord if people are sitting husband here wife here and then you tell her you are the best wife I and then the husband says the wife says you have the best husband I that's that's the thing and you take it by Fai were you forced to go with that man you forced to go with that woman no you did it willfully if you were how many years have you stayed together and they still forcing you there that is the best husband and that is the best wife and thank God for your husband Lord I Thank you for my husband Lord I Thank you for my wife and don't seek to [Music] replace don't do that praise the name of our Lord so when we have challenges at home let us always learn to seek the Lord present the issue before the Lord and say Lord this is the challenge this is the situation we are going through how I need your intervention how I need your grace praise the name of our Lord pray for your marriage because God say it's not good for man to be alone and then he said I will make a help me so you are meet for one another and be thankful to God Lord I Thank you for my word Lord I Thank you for my husband so don't be treacherous don't allow Hardness of Heart you know the Bible says that Moses gave them the bill of divorce because of the hardness of the heart but now we have the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ is the solution to the hardness of heart so bring your heart under the blood of Jesus Christ then it will take away that hardness it will take away that that looks for the mistakes of your wife praise the name of the Lord of Jesus Christ will take away those eyes that look for the fults about your husband there is a brother some years ago that for him he had the black book and when they I'm putting in the black book those are warnings so he writes the date the time what the wife has done you have a black bookes big book maybe this page gets over open another one we have the blood of Jesus Christ put that black book in the blood of Jesus how are you going to live together if you can't forgive one another how are you going to leave if all the time you are talking about the mistakes about the faults about the failures and you know there are some people whose life is all about being negative negative things think looks like he going to do this there's something wrong with you you know and some take their marriage to be like that when come home I found my wife didn't greet me she didn't pick the things I took and then you start complex buil there when I went to the husband and him this didn't but again when I his the phone again he's talking to this sister here then a complex starts building when you go to his place of work you know he sits here there some young women there then I them they conversing now home he doesn't want to talk comp it makes things more complex until you find it is a small thing and then it becomes a bigger thing pray for your marriage and then when you're in marriage learn to forgive one another learn to bear with one another and don't imagine something which is wrong against your wife or against your husband don't imagine that you know when you imagine that it's your tormenting yourself you are tormenting yourself you know when you keep on allowing evil things into your heart evil things into your heart they will even take away your peace until you don't have peace this person used to be big but what is small your piece has been taken away maybe because of evil imagination you are imagining something which is not true and then after imagining it you start dreaming it are those are your imaginations praise the name of our Lord remove the hardness of heart unforgiving spirit is a hard heart so you remove that a hard heart when you read in the scripture Leed to separation and divorcement that's what it goes to because how do you live together in a house and your heart is hard against your husband your heart is hard against your wife how do you live together praise the name of the Lord so you need to remove that hard heart remove that ston heart un forgiving heart there is the blood of Jesus Christ allow the blood of Jesus Christ to come into your marriage allow Christ to come and take over to full charge oftion that you and then don't take wrong Cel don't take wrong coun praise the name of our Lord you know there is a person who went and married and then they told him the person you are married is not right he had left his wife then God said went to some place picked a wife and then now in the ear times of you know living together he he would say you know my wife is so good she kneels all the time even when she's bringing something she just crawls on the knees and this man that was very good and then other people visited that home and then she was also doing the same that even when you bring greens he says that thank you for for buy for buying but after six months something happened in that home now the man would start saying let us open our Bibles and read then the wife would start are choosing him what are you going to read then the husband starts reading the wife say that scripture there is choosing you choing you what a home we shouldn't have those Stony hearts unforgiving hearts hearts that are always are choosing one another heart that are always finding fault with one another what kind of are you going to have how are you going to

are playing what you did we shouldn't do those kind of things have a Heart That Forgives your husband Have a Heart That Forgives your wife in First Peter chapter 3 praise the name of our Lord First Peter chapter 3 and then we go to verse verse seven the Bible says likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being hairs together of the grace of life that your prayers beind the Bible says there a problem at home and you're not dealing well with one another your prayers can be hindered you need to reconcile praise the name of our Lord you need to be considerate with one another by the time you your parents and you came together you needed one another and that should be the same thing now that I love my wife I love my husband you need one another and you see what the devil does when you are single you now admire those who are married to get there then you get there and then the devil what he does he comes and makes the confusion and then you start ad those are single that's the devil when you were out you wanted to get him when you were in you want to get up why there's something wrong so learn to bear with one another now that you are together don't start looking at but now you are together out not sleep hungry not looking at the your of being at home is pass praise the name of our Lord now it's for you to be together so work out to be together and then you know there are some when they find here in the marriage is hot they Retreat and this happens both to both to men and women you may find a man doesn't want to leave the parent home he's failing to meet responsibilities and then also you find a wife but the reason of going there things are not working out make them work out praise the name of the Lord how many make year every time I'm going back every time I'm going back the husband also when things are hot starts are choosing the wife and then he Retreats back home that's not what it's meant to be learn to live together as husband learn to bear with one another then the Bible says finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be cous the Bible says be of one mind husband and wife be of one mind and you see in the interest of Christ he wants to have the same mind with the brother even as a wife and a husband have the same mind try to do things together trying to share your ideas your plans your desires I think we could do this I think we could do this but then you find this one is going left the other one is going right how are you going to meet how are you going to have a common ground so we need to have one mind in our marriages and when you have one mind the Bible says have compassion one of another have compassion when you need compassion when you see there's weakness in your when you see there's weakness in your then you have compassion trying to support each other against one another prise the name of our for example if somebody is your help meet you know that's when you are so weak where you where you are weak let your wife be strong where your husband is weak let the wife be strong when the wife is weak let the husband be strong be one praise the name of our Lord pleas make sure that you're moving together as husband and wife and then you're not seeking differences he said this me I refused it now let me also wait for him also now it is my turn the other time you refused I'm also refusing that's not the right attitude you can't build a house together when you are contrary this one is Raising this one is bringing down it can't work out let us have one mind let us have compassion one for another and then the Bible says love as Brethren be pitiful be cous and if he has done you evil don't render evil for evil when he does raing that's now in verse 9 not rendering evil for evil oring foring butse blessing knowing that you are there unto that you should inherit a blessing you don't go to God and start choing your husband go and start choosing your wife but in your prayer say Lord help my wife Lord help my husband deliver him in his weakness Del in our weakness you know you are supporting one another you are blessing one another if he has done you something wrong forgive him don't seek to Revenge if he shouts at you don't shout back praise the name of our Lord but then you get in some places it is really hot until the children become scared it not be like that at our praise the name of our Lord be loving one another have compassion for one another be considerate for one another take interest in each other praise the name of our Lord like if your husband is sick if your wife is sick is that the time you do this and this and this get up of your bed go and F water and swallow the medicine or you'll take the water and the medicine said please take this is the time because the man is weak but what the devil does when he's weak is when you show him that you are weak that's not the thing that's when your support is needed to Bear him to help him to support him that's what is expected in our marriages not count accusation you did this you also did the other you did this also did the other not be in our homes praise the name of our Lord learn how to bear with one another if you in marriage there is no better marriage than what you have make it work out establish it create peace in it yourself create peace in your marriage you know there's something that takes away peace leave it praise the name of the Lord why would you want to ins no humble yourself praise the name of the Lord now there is a man who said that my wife has three demons and then they had different color then brother said no let us go to this quot praise the name of our Lord in the message why are people so tossed about he said I stood a few weeks ago where there was a big tent erected and where a man said he could cast out evil spirits which I have no doubt by that but evil spirits are not cast out by cruel indifferent living you're getting it you may think your wife has evil spirit your husband has evil spirit so you don't say I'm going to become tough that's not the way then he says the most powerful weapon there is in the world is love I stood by a little lady the other night where the husband was fixing to leave her and marry another woman very fine no couple I looked at her she said oh I'm going to leave brother Bram I said don't do it sister told her said oh my husband his ministry will be ruined what can I do I'm going to New York I'm going to get me a job and now sometimes those are now the excuses you know there are some people when things are hot at home they seek transfer sometimes he will create an excuse and they do something different but yet that is not solving the problem but you are creating a greater problem sit together and solve that issue so this one was saying I'll go to New York and get a job the objective of the job was not really the job but to stay apart Hardness of Heart then he says I say don't do it don't do it sister what can I do brother BR I said go up to him said I found the lady's picture and broke it up and done so and so I said see go to him put your arms around him say my sweetheart no matter what you done I still love you that will do it that's right now you can imagine this kind of and then how many people go in the husband or the wife pH then scroll if it is a wife when you find there John joh who is this John then you follow if it is a wife you got the husband's phone and then you find there ah there is this one here say who is this honey not me then an issue start from there no food today I'm going to my parents that's kind of thing then you start wondering why has she gone without telling me you go to your honey Traves now the man is confused I don't [Music] knowy Tres but now brother Bram go and say you are my sweethart it doesn't matter what has happen use love to reconcile and the Bible says love covers a multitude of sin Love Takes Over All Those weaknesses just love your wife regardless love your husband regardless I still love you I still love you that's what should be in our home compassion for one another not trying to get you know kind of things like you know his weakness let me hit him now he has been doing this at my back this is now the time to show this is the time to expose him you are destroying your marriage you are destroying your house let me expose everybody to know both of you are going to be ashamed praise the name of our learn how to handle those issues of differences together husband and if your are heart don't go and just be harsh but seek where you can talk in a friendly way the other day you did dis but hurt me a lot you know and then now if he doesn't say I'm sorry don't take it so much against him again pray for him you will change him you know the Bible says a soft answer praise the name of our Lord it takes away strife but if he says this he also say this what are you going to have praise the name of our Lord now he continues to say in paragraph 174 just a continuation a fellow came to me not long ago he was a Pentecostal he had seen too of these meetings and he goes in and his wife was a stun Luther she said well I guess you all went down and shouted last night criticizing the husband who is a Pentecostal shouted last night said I guess you was all speaking in tongues and doing all this last night he got on the floor and said now that's the husband God I cast out this devil out of her I cast The Devil out of her and then finally it is almost a divorce case man a find man he come to me and he said brother Bram we are going to have a divorce said I just can't get that devil out of her then was bringing a divorce and you know those are now kind of understanding or interpretations against one another I've tried this my wife has not CH I've tried this my husband let me leave him alone then he said I said brother you are going at it the wrong way I say when she starts like that say all right dear bless your heart honey and be real kind to her see how much you can do for her now you're seeing it she's coming criticizing you no I love you you are still mine you're seeing you are breaking some kind of power that possessing her by showing kindness and then say brother Bram well how will I ever get the devil out I said you do as I say just keep praying in your heart see I said God will take care of the rest of it he called me up about two or 3 weeks later he said my home is revolutional he said my wife is a different person praise the name of our Lord now you may be in challenges at home have you tried love in those challenges have you brought in love for your wife for your husband have you brought in kindness have you brought in compassion where she is weak have you become combative or you have been supportive say I will stand with you I will help you praise the name of our Lord this man was going to separate with the but when he was told please apply love then the home completely changed and so he didn't look at this wife as having demons but completely changed let us bring love back in our home praise the name of our apply Love in Your Heart regardless of the weakness of your wife regardless of the weakness of your husband love them regardless and that love will change them that love will transform them praise the name of our Lord and then you'll see that your marriage is so happy your marriage is so blessed praise the name of our Lord pray for your marriage and see that the devil doesn't get there to create differences to create you know misunderstanding to create this kind of issue you shouldn't do like that praise the name of our Lord so you should see that you work out to make your marriage work out praise the name of our Lord make sure your marriage works out now in the message he says my wife I love her I made a covenant with her to be her husband love your wife love your husband regardless the challenge that you are going through regardless of the problems you're going through love one another's Brethren praise the name over lord have compassion for one another pitiful be kind then he said and if I was away from home and so some woman would come to me and say I love you and I wanted I felt that I would make love to that woman and and M would forgive me for it if I went home I still wouldn't do it though I know she would forgive me I wouldn't hurt her like that and a man that loves God you don't quit drinking smoking just because you are keep you from going to hell if you love the Lord you do it because you don't want to hurt him and that's the same feeling we should have for husband and wife I don't want to hurt my wife I don't want to hurt my husband so you avoid doing things that you know will hurt the other praise the name of our Lord because you love one another so you avoid those things anything that's bringing Argent put it aside be always reconciled loving one another praise the name of our Lord pray for your marriage praise the name of our Lord pray for your marriage and if you are not married you want to get a right husband you want to get a right wife the first thing you do be right with God praise the name of the Lord you want a good husband you want a good wife also be good with God that's where you start from when you are good with God when you are right with God then you will bring the right person but if you are not you bring one who is like you then when you get in the house you start wondering how did I get you you know because everybody is a [Music] cheat doed made Corners then you get one who has also made Corners you get your likeness so you better get the likeness of God you better get the likeness yourself have the likeness of God then he will give you his own likeness praise the name of our Lord and you'll have peace praise the name of our Lord that's what you should do the Bible says they will lie they will also be lied so you lie to this one and know he's also going to get lies to lie to you then you find yourself you both lie to one another but again you are together shouldn't work like that so if you want to get a good husband or a right husband or a right wife be right with God praise the name of our Lord now in this message look to Jesus brother Bram says and I said this not because she's sitting there because I say it when she is not there and you know that I don't believe there could be a better wife in the world than my wife how about you is there a better husband in the world than your husband or is there a better wife in the world than your wife no she's the best and work it out to be so always praise the name of our Lord and he says I hope she always remains that way and I want to be a royal husband and I hope that every young man in this building when he gets married gets a wife like my wife I don't know how long we live that way but I hope the rest of our days on us we've been very happy together God was the one who told me to marry her at the same time not knowing I was trying not to marry her not because I didn't love her but because I would think I was not I was I I didn't think I was able to make a living for her and she was a fine woman and I just didn't deserve that and she went out to pray and opened the Bible and said Lord I've never did this before give me a scripture that will help me if I I got forget him I have forget it open the Bible and she went out in the little shed and prayed and when she opened the Bible Malachi 4 behold I sent you Elijah the prophet that was something years ago knowing nothing about the ministry of this day and I couldn't be I was lying down on the river there and he woke me up one night and I heard him standing there by the door he's now talking of Christ he saying go get her and your wedding shall be this coming October the 23 and that's just exactly what I did and we've lived Happy by the grace of God we've never heard one word she's been a sweetheart now I'm bringing this example to look to see how brother Bram married he waited on the Lord until the Lord said she's the one waited on the Lord until the Lord said he is the one and then the Lord told them you are going to wait on 23rd of October this year and then the Bible says what God has joined together let no man put a now you see that their marriage it is God that purposed it their marriage it's God that revealed to each of them that they should be married and they followed every point that the Lord guided and now they had been living together for quite many years but now brother Bram because of his ministry he develops a challenge and then he desire to go and live in the mountains you remember even on his hon with mid they went to hunting what a hon was praise the name of the Lord and then here he felt after number of years that you see God has called me to be a prophet so let me go to the mountains let me go to the Wilderness and I should put my home that that's what he was developing in his mind now in the message standing in the Gap so he went so he went to sleep and I went speeding down the road about 55 miles an hour in a track going over the mountain coming on towards the Border down coming to Arizona but I was coming now in water and I got there coming down from the mountains and about 20 miles out of the city you you've heard it as I told you about the morning about the squirrel and all these things how something somebody went to talking to me a voice just as same as you hear mine I know it sounds neurotic but as I've got through but as I have got through expressing have I ever told you anything but what was right and a voice go to talking to me I was talking to him it said carry out your plans and you will be like that I said Lord I don't want to be like that he said your wife will go to so she won't live up there in them Hills like that and you'll become a bum just as the dream showed you would I said I don't want to be that I don't want to have like to live like that I want to do something different but I was told that you called me to be a prophet and I want to live in the wilderness like the prophet but I was using my own excuse so I could hunt my own good he said but the prophet was the Old Testament you've been called to be there in a much higher office than that he saying you have more gifts besides that you are called to pray for the SE and to preach the gospel and in the apostolic form you know of greater things many great gifts praise the name of our Lord now you see the scenario here a complex comes to the husband and the husband feels ah I should go to the mountains and then the Lord tells him wife is going to leave you so then we need to find out ourselves what have I contributed to the condition of my marriage now what have I done maybe you have made a mistake some maybe you took some things slightly some and then you don't start choosing your husband don't start at choosing your wife but now you who is here you is hearing you need to do something about your mind to make your marriage work out and don't say no my husband doesn't care my wife doesn't care what have you done have you taken the challenge in love you know with love with prayer and said Lord intervene in the St of my mind praise the name of our Lord you know it's a challenging time that we have now when you hear what happens in marriage is not really Pleasant fighting abusing one another denying one another this this it's not pleasant at all but yet God put the marriage institution where you could live happily he said if when you get a wife you got a good thing but then how does your good thing become bad how does it be the Bible says when you get a wife you find favor of the Lord but how does it become this favor in your home there something wrong which need to be handled by yourself praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says you know people can inherit riches they can inherit houses from their parents they can inherit whatever possessions from their parents praise the name of our Lord let us go to Proverbs praise the name of our Lord Proverbs 19 verse4 Proverbs 19 verse4 the scripture says 19 verse 19 verse4 houses and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a Prudent Wife is from the Lord he says you can inherit houses riches your parents can give you that but when it comes to get a Prudent Wife comes from the Lord and now as a husband you must believe you have a Prudent Wife but if you don't believe that you'll be thinking of exchanging you must believe my wife is prudent my wife is the best and work out on that to bring happiness in your home praise the name of our says a Prudent Wife is from the Lord now the Lord doesn't give to one till death praise the name of our Lord one till death so work out your marriage to be successful don't look for excuses you know my wife doesn't do this she doesn't how do this sh upon you give her support encourage her strengthen her but then you go to your relatives and then you are talking about your wife every fun who will give respect to you who will give respect to your house you are the one ding your house you are the one breaking your house where will you get Confidence from her whenever she goes there they say no it shouldn't be like that be reconciled in love praise the name of our Lord take her as a Prudent Wife give her honor give her respect even in her weakness tell her you are the best praise the name of our Lord tell her you are the best and as we say there is no better wife than one you have make her better praise the name of our Lord cherish her her praise the name of our Lord sustain her praise the name of our Lord you know there are some young men they want to go by those kind of ladies who know how to put on matching cloes matching styles nice figure nice [Music] presentation everyone will look at you that's not what makes marriage praise the name of the Lord that's not what makes marriage that can be there one two years after five years what's going to Happ what will happen praise the name of the Lord we need to see that we build our houses let us maintain our houses sustain them build your marriage don't break it don't scatter it don't kind of you know spoil it take it as so precious from God counted you worthy that you

marriage becomes better praise the name of Lord see how it works out see how it becomes better than it has ever been learn how you pray together how you handle things together praise the name of the Lord and if you're a wife be the best wife the Bible says in Proverbs 31: who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies a virtuous woman as a wife be a virtuous wife praise the name of our told my husband to love me are you virtuous also praise the name of the Lord they work both SES take interest in your marriage you know see that you do something to make it better not only looking at the other side you're only receiving what are you giving out in your relationship because it's a two way to work you have to make it work out praise the name of the Lord let the wife be

name of our Lord take time wait on the Lord pray for your marriage lift your husband before God lift your wife before God praise the name of our Lord I want to S we can finish in Proverbs 22:14 the Bible says the mouth of a strange the mouth of strange women is a deep pit he that is abod of the Lord shall fall therein Proverbs 22 verse 14 14 now you see the protection of God here you know there are so many strange women around women who desire you they will desire you to be theirs but they are not theirs now the Bible says if the Lord AB [Music] you in other words your ways before God are not right you'll fall in those pits go with this woman today go with the other woman the other day because the Lord BS you you are not living a right life so you need to see that your personal relationship your personal relationship is Pleasant before God praise the name of the Lord live a life that is upright live a life that is Pleasant live a life that God will Delight him praise the name of our Lord and so the Bible also tells us in Ecclesiastes 9 ver9 live joyfully with the wife whom though lovest all the days of thy life of thy vanity which he has given thee Under the Sun all the days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in thy labor which thou take under the sun for [Music] for amen live joyfully with the wife that's not so it's not because this one is like in the Old Testament you find that cleanness in her you go outs go back to your home don't say that if you are renting they stop paying rent food stop sending he got and he got a job he get a woman there like now there are some of this kind of places of work Road contractors when they go to this project maybe in this area they will get their women and produce their children when the contract is over the marriage is also over he gets another contract somewhere he gets again another one that's not right so in Proverbs Chapter 5 and then Verse 18 the Bible says let the Fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth he not wives it's not saying wives but wife of yourth the one you delighted in Rejoice with her he calls a wife of your youth because many people marry when they are youth so God expects you to grow old together and he wants you to live joyfully together praise the name of the Lord be joyful with your let not circumstances put you together maybe there is a function that's when you pretend to come together be like that every day without function you are together you know you just love one another you are part of one another praise the name of
