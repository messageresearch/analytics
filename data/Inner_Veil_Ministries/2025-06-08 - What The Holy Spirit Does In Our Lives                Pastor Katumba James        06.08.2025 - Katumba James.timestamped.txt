[6:58] and we sing that song.
[7:02] [Music]
[7:05] Jesus has a table spread.
[7:08] It is come and dine.
[7:12] Jesus has a table spread where the
[7:16] saints of God are fed. He invites his
[7:21] chosen people come and
[7:27] with his man does speak and supplies our
[7:33] every need.

[10:47] Amen. We thank God for this evening.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father, in the name of our
[10:53] Lord Jesus Christ,
[10:56] we thank you that you've called us to
[10:58] come and die.
[11:01] And whenever there is a call of the
[11:03] Lord,
[11:05] the table is already made.
[11:09] Now you called all those people from
[11:10] different places
[11:13] that come to the king's banquet

[11:20] and we believe in now everything is
[11:22] said.

[11:32] even as we've come into your presence.
[11:34] Lord we pray may wash us in the blood of

[11:41] captivity

[11:48] and grant all the hearts desire of all
[11:50] your children.
[11:52] We love you Lord and we thank you Lord
[11:55] in the name of the Lord Jesus pray this
[11:59] Amen. Amen.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Let us go to the book of Romans chapter
[12:02] 8.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. We read in
[12:07] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; So we're reading Romans chapter 8
[12:15] from verse 5 to verse 11.
[12:20] So the scripture says,
[12:24] &gt;&gt; "For they that are after the flesh do
[12:27] mind the things of the flesh, but they
[12:29] that are after the spirit the things of
[12:32] the spirit.
[12:40] For to be minded is death, but to be
[12:44] spiritually minded is life and peace.
[12:54] Because the carnal mind is enimity
[12:57] against God, for it is not subject to
[13:01] the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[13:17] So then they that are in the flesh
[13:20] cannot please God.
[13:25] But you are not in the flesh, but in the
[13:29] spirit, if so be that the spirit of God
[13:32] dwell in you. Now if any man have not
[13:35] the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[14:01] And if Christ be in you, the body is
[14:04] dead because of sin, but the spirit is
[14:08] life because of righteousness.
[14:11] Sorry.
[14:29] Och.
[14:40] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[14:42] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[14:46] that raised up Christ from the dead
[14:48] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[14:52] his spirit that dwelleth in you.
[15:15] May God blessing of his word.
[15:18] You may be seated.
[15:20] So I want to preach on the subject.
[15:24] What the Holy Spirit does in our lives.
[15:29] what the Holy Spirit does in our lives.
[15:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[15:36] message,
[15:38] what was the Holy Ghost given for
[15:43] in paragraph 19?
[15:47] Now the purpose,
[15:50] what was God's purpose in sending the
[15:52] Holy Spirit?
[15:57] [Music]
[16:00] Now mark down
[16:03] John 14
[16:06] beginning at the verse
[16:09] at the 14th verse
[16:13] and reading through the chapter for the
[16:15] basis
[16:19] God's purpose we find here
[16:24] in sending the Holy Spirit
[16:27] was one purpose
[16:31] that God himself
[16:35] might dwell in his church
[16:39] and continue his plan through the church
[16:46] that God was in Christ
[16:51] contining his plan through Christ.
[16:56] out of Christ into the church,
[17:00] continuing his work through the church.
[17:06] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[17:08] reason why God gives us the Holy Spirit
[17:13] is that he can continue his work
[17:18] that he can continue his work in us
[17:22] the way he was in Christ
[17:26] doing his work.
[17:28] So now when the Holy Spirit comes in us,
[17:32] he comes to fulfill the purpose of God
[17:37] that God himself lives in us.
[17:43] Praise the name of our Lord that God can
[17:45] take charge over our lives
[17:51] like we've read here in Romans chapter 8
[17:55] that they that are in the flesh
[17:58] cannot please God.
[18:01] But you know our first birth,
[18:03] we were born in this flesh
[18:07] until we get the second birth.
[18:11] We cannot have the Holy Spirit living in
[18:13] us.
[18:16] So now when you get the new birth,
[18:19] when you have the spirit of God living
[18:21] in you,
[18:24] you are a creation.
[18:26] after the new creation.
[18:30] So now even your interests
[18:34] are of the things of God.
[18:36] So even when you are living here on
[18:38] earth,
[18:40] &gt;&gt; you don't live after the flesh,
[18:43] but you live after the Holy Spirit
[18:47] that has been given to you.
[18:51] You know, you find that your interests
[18:53] change.
[18:57] You find that your desires change.
[19:01] You find that even the way you handle
[19:03] things change.
[19:05] Why? Because the Holy Spirit
[19:08] dwells inside of you. So now it is God
[19:12] himself,
[19:14] you know, continuing his own work,
[19:20] doing his own will.
[19:22] Praise the name of our Lord which he
[19:25] desires.
[19:27] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[19:30] message, what does it take to make a
[19:33] Christian life?
[19:38] Paragraph 35.
[19:40] He says the Holy Spirit
[19:44] will make every movement like Christ.
[19:56] It will make you Christlike.
[20:01] The fruit of the spirit,
[20:04] love,
[20:06] &gt;&gt; joy, peace,
[20:08] longsuffering,
[20:10] &gt;&gt; goodness,
[20:12] &gt;&gt; meekness,
[20:14] &gt;&gt; gentleness,
[20:18] patience,
[20:20] faith. Those things are what the Holy
[20:23] Spirit controls.
[20:26] Our
[20:27] emotions is not so much as jumping up
[20:30] and down.
[20:35] You could do that
[20:39] bring that to you.
[20:44] But the Holy Spirit
[20:46] brings you into operation
[20:50] or in control of God
[20:54] that you walk in peace and in love
[21:00] in joy
[21:02] with longsuffering,
[21:04] goodness, meekness,
[21:07] gentleness,
[21:09] patience. You see, it isn't something
[21:13] that you do.
[21:17] [Music]
[21:20] It is something the Holy Ghost does in
[21:23] you.
[21:26] You see, it's no longer an intellectual
[21:29] thought of your own.
[21:34] It is a subconscious moving of the Holy
[21:38] Spirit.
[21:42] In other words, the Holy Spirit takes
[21:44] over your life
[21:47] and you do things,
[21:50] you know, many times without kind of a a
[21:53] pre decision
[21:57] or maybe something you do unconsciously.
[22:02] You know, you find yourself
[22:05] loving your enemies.
[22:08] Praise the name of our Lord. You find
[22:10] yourself
[22:12] you know that you you are forgiving
[22:14] somebody regardless of what they have
[22:16] done.
[22:18] You know just like the sheep when they
[22:21] have removed the wool from the sheep.
[22:25] It is its nature to produce the wool.
[22:29] Even when you remove that wool from the
[22:31] sheep,
[22:34] the nature will produce more wool.
[22:38] So that's how the Holy Spirit does also
[22:41] in our lives.
[22:43] When the Holy Ghost is in our lives, he
[22:47] will make you live the life of Jesus
[22:49] Christ.
[22:51] He will make you have the mind of Jesus
[22:53] Christ.
[22:54] He will make you bear the fruit of the
[22:56] spirit.
[22:59] He will make you do the works of Christ.
[23:03] You know, it is something that is part
[23:04] of you.
[23:07] Even when they put you under some kind
[23:09] of hard scenarios,
[23:13] the life that is in you
[23:16] is something which is automatic.
[23:19] It just comes out.
[23:23] Praise the name of our Lord. That's what
[23:24] he's saying here.
[23:27] Then he says, I wish I could shout the
[23:28] praises of God around the world to that.
[23:32] I wish I could shout the praises of God.
[23:38] around the world to that
[23:42] the church of the living God.
[23:45] There is where our Pentecostal move
[23:47] failed.
[23:52] We have so much we have some manmade
[23:56] musical clap hands jump and down
[23:58] emotion.
[24:05] When it when if we go back out on the
[24:09] street
[24:12] and the Holy Spirit does not govern our
[24:14] lives
[24:18] to cooperate with that,
[24:22] we have not got the Holy Spirit,
[24:27] you know, because there is a lot of
[24:29] makeup,
[24:31] you
[24:32] this somebody they just want to act
[24:37] you know maybe they want to get somebody
[24:39] some people into some kind of thought
[24:40] and move under that kind of move
[24:46] but you see the Holy Spirit should be
[24:48] something junior in somebody's life
[24:52] that the life comes out automatically
[24:57] not some form of psychology
[25:01] Like in psychology or in sociology
[25:05] which they teach in schools they can
[25:08] teach you how to behave.
[25:12] You know when you see this person you do
[25:13] also like this.
[25:16] You need to see that you hold your
[25:18] temper.
[25:20] You need to see that you don't shout.
[25:27] But when the Holy Spirit is in you
[25:31] is that the decision you make at a
[25:34] challenging point,
[25:38] you didn't think about it even in the
[25:40] morning,
[25:42] but it certainly comes
[25:45] like when brother Brham was warned about
[25:48] a trap which was set for him.
[25:53] He didn't know how the trap was.
[25:56] But then he was preaching in the church
[25:59] and then a woman and a man come and do
[26:01] all the funny things in the church.
[26:06] And then he wondered then he told him
[26:09] stop doing what you're doing.
[26:11] He kept on doing whatever they were
[26:13] doing.
[26:14] And then the spirit told him you can
[26:16] speak anything.
[26:19] Then he wondered what should I do.
[26:22] Then he said, "I forgive you."
[26:25] It was the life of Christ
[26:28] that was in him that came out
[26:32] to make that kind of decision.
[26:35] And so even us when we have the spirit
[26:37] of God,
[26:39] we shall always make the right decisions
[26:42] in our lives.
[26:45] The Holy Spirit will guide you even in
[26:48] challenging situations.
[26:51] Sometimes you've never gone through that
[26:52] situation.
[26:54] But when the spirit of God is there, it
[26:58] will help you to make the right
[26:59] decision.
[27:02] Praise the name of our Lord, he will
[27:04] make you follow the word of God
[27:08] because the Bible says when he, the
[27:10] spirit of truth comes,
[27:12] he will guide you into all truth.
[27:17] And it's the Holy Spirit
[27:20] who teaches us all the truth.
[27:23] So then he guides us into all his truth.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. When the
[27:30] spirit of God comes down in your life
[27:33] and you see the Bible says you will not
[27:36] rejoice in evil
[27:40] and even the Holy Spirit in our lives
[27:44] we cannot rejoice in evil.
[27:48] Praise.
[27:49] Praise the name of our Lord in 1
[27:52] Corinthians chapter 13
[27:59] and then verse four.
[28:03] He says charity suffers long.
[28:10] Charity is kind.
[28:13] Charity enies not.
[28:18] Charity ves not
[28:23] is not path
[28:26] does not behave itself unseemly
[28:31] seeketh not her own
[28:34] is not easily provoked
[28:37] thinkketh no evil
[28:42] rejoices not in iniquity
[28:46] but rejoices in the truth,
[28:50] bears all things,
[28:53] believeth all things, hopes all things,
[28:57] endures all things.
[29:01] And brother Brandham says this charity
[29:05] is the Holy Spirit. So when the Holy
[29:08] Spirit is in us,
[29:11] you'll have longsuffering.
[29:15] You'll have kindness.
[29:18] You will not, you know, v.
[29:23] You are not going to know to put
[29:25] yourself above everybody.
[29:30] You're not going to behave unsemly.
[29:34] You're not going to seek your own.
[29:38] You are not easily provoked,
[29:45] you know, shortteered.
[29:48] Just one word you are off.
[29:52] Just only something small you say I can
[29:54] no longer come to this place.
[29:59] The Holy Spirit will hold you
[30:03] to become
[30:06] praise the name of our Lord. Even
[30:08] inations where you are provoked,
[30:11] it says you think no evil.
[30:17] You know something maybe you you want to
[30:19] kind of revenge,
[30:25] you know, things which are not
[30:26] appropriate.
[30:28] So when the Holy Spirit comes in our
[30:30] lives,
[30:32] he gives his own life.
[30:37] Praise the name of our Lord. He does not
[30:39] rejoice in iniquity
[30:44] that but only rejoices in the truth
[30:48] because it is the Holy Spirit that leads
[30:51] you into all the truth.
[30:54] Praise the name of our Lord. When the
[30:57] Holy Spirit comes in our lives,
[31:01] it's no longer our desires.
[31:04] It's no longer your life.
[31:07] It's the life of Christ himself
[31:11] living in you. Praise the name of our
[31:13] Lord. So you can now look at the life
[31:16] you live
[31:18] and then the way the Bible says you look
[31:21] in the glass
[31:23] praise the name of the Lord and see the
[31:25] life that I live
[31:27] does it match with the word
[31:31] praise the name of our Lord so you can
[31:33] prove your life
[31:35] I have the spirit of God or I don't have
[31:38] the spirit of God
[31:41] praise the name of our Lord back in this
[31:44] quote
[31:48] back in this quote which we've been
[31:50] reading
[31:55] in this message, what does it take to be
[31:58] a Christian?
[32:02] He says
[32:07] &gt;&gt; when if you go back
[32:10] &gt;&gt; on the street and the Holy Ghost doesn't
[32:12] govern your lives to cooperate with
[32:15] that.
[32:19] We have not got the Holy Spirit.
[32:23] That is not ski.
[32:28] But brother, that's what the church
[32:31] needs.
[32:34] Only life can come by the Holy Spirit.
[32:41] Did you ever notice how God in his
[32:44] Bible,
[32:47] how wonderful he made things?
[32:50] Just one moment now.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Except a man be born again,
[32:59] You will know what enter into the
[33:01] kingdom.
[33:04] You've got to be born again.
[33:07] You've got to be.
[33:10] What is it? That doesn't mean an
[33:13] experience that you shouted or spoke
[33:14] with tongues.
[33:20] Those things are fine.
[33:22] But that isn't what I'm talking about
[33:25] this morning.
[33:28] If your life doesn't cooperate
[33:33] or doesn't testify of your emotions
[33:40] that you receive when you spoke with
[33:42] tongues,
[33:45] then you are deceived
[33:48] because the Holy Spirit
[33:51] takes your innermost being
[33:56] and controls you
[34:00] as you are
[34:02] makes you
[34:04] forms you into a Christian
[34:10] man or Christian woman.
[34:13] It takes off with your life.
[34:18] There is something in you pushing you
[34:24] that is making you do it anyhow.
[34:29] It makes you love those who spit on you.
[34:35] It makes you love those who said that
[34:37] you are insane.
[34:43] When you get the spirit in you,
[34:46] then the burdens of life
[34:50] becomes light.
[34:54] You don't notice them anymore.
[34:58] The yoke is lined with feathers.
[35:11] They become so easy.
[35:15] Then the people pile things on you.
[35:20] You know what? You are like Samson at
[35:24] the gates of Gaza
[35:29] who picked up the big brass gate
[35:35] and he packed it on up to the hill.
[35:39] Praise the name of Allah. It's a very
[35:41] interesting one. He says when you have
[35:44] the spirit of God, you are like Samson.
[35:48] You know they pack things on you.
[35:52] But God gives you the grace.
[35:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Maybe what
[35:58] they are packing on you is criticism.
[36:02] You know, maybe what they are packing on
[36:04] you is isolation.
[36:08] Maybe what they are packing on you is
[36:09] persecution.
[36:12] Maybe what they are packing on you.
[36:15] There are some form of trials.
[36:19] There are some forms of temptations,
[36:22] but there's the Holy Spirit in you.
[36:25] He enables you, praise the name of our
[36:28] Lord, to be in a position to overcome
[36:30] all those things.
[36:33] Like Samson, he would carry the gate
[36:37] which many people cannot carry, but he
[36:40] moves it up
[36:42] when the spirit of God will come upon
[36:44] him.
[36:46] So it's also the same thing with us,
[36:49] praise the name of our Lord is that
[36:51] every stress you go through,
[36:55] every situation you go through, you
[36:58] know, every challenge that comes your
[37:00] life, the Holy Spirit gives you the
[37:03] ability
[37:05] to overcome those kind of stressions.
[37:08] There may be stressions at home. There
[37:11] may be stressions at your place of work
[37:14] or wherever you go. Maybe you are moving
[37:16] on the road.
[37:18] Still the Holy Spirit in you will give
[37:21] you the ability
[37:24] to walk in all the truth.
[37:26] Praise the name of our Lord. You don't
[37:28] only walk in the truth where people love
[37:30] you.
[37:33] But even where people hate you,
[37:37] &gt;&gt; you'll be able to stand by the truth
[37:41] because that's the purpose of the Holy
[37:42] Spirit is it guides us into all truth
[37:48] and the truth is the word of God.
[37:51] So you can't say I can only do the word
[37:53] of God when I'm at home.
[37:57] When I'm at a place of work, I'm doing
[37:59] what the Romans do.
[38:03] Because they say when you're in Rome,
[38:04] you do like the Romans.
[38:08] When you among thieves, you behave like
[38:10] thieves.
[38:12] All drunkers, you also drink.
[38:17] No, the Holy Ghost is not like that.
[38:20] Like Joseph when he the spirit of God
[38:23] was upon him
[38:26] and he went into the house of Portifer,
[38:29] they were idol worshippers.
[38:32] But he was not worshiping the idols.
[38:36] You know the the the wife
[38:39] behaved like a prostitute.
[38:42] But he wouldn't go over to what she
[38:44] wanted.
[38:46] Why? Because the life which was in
[38:48] Joseph
[38:49] was totally different.
[38:52] And that's what the Holy Spirit also
[38:54] does in our lives.
[38:57] Praise the name of our Lord. You may
[38:59] have friends or maybe at the places of
[39:02] work, maybe they are busy doing this
[39:05] funny thing,
[39:07] maybe they preparing end of year party,
[39:13] you know, and then they to dress funny,
[39:16] do all kind of makeup,
[39:19] but the Holy Spirit in you will not
[39:23] allow you to get yourself involved in
[39:24] those dirties
[39:27] because it is not your test.
[39:30] It's not your nature.
[39:33] You even avoid those kind of things.
[39:36] Praise the name of our Lord because it
[39:38] is something different inside of you.
[39:42] So now when the Holy Spirit is in our
[39:44] lives,
[39:46] he will give us the ability
[39:49] to live the life of Jesus Christ. It
[39:52] doesn't become a struggle.
[39:56] Praise the name of the Lord. The birds,
[39:59] they don't struggle to put on feathers.
[40:05] It is something that is inside of them.
[40:09] So even the Holy Spirit, praise the name
[40:12] of our Lord, when he's inside of you, he
[40:16] will produce his own character.
[40:21] And that's what we should always desire
[40:23] God.
[40:24] And if there is any condition
[40:27] that is grieving the Holy Spirit,
[40:31] you ask God deliver me from this
[40:32] situation
[40:34] because it is limiting me
[40:37] from coming to my full potential.
[40:41] Praise the name of the Lord. Because you
[40:43] have declared,
[40:46] you have confessed, I'm a Christian
[40:49] and live the life of a Christian.
[40:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[40:54] says,
[40:56] &gt;&gt; "And when you get to a place
[40:59] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Spirit has you,
[41:05] not you, the Holy Spirit,
[41:12] but the Holy Spirit has you."
[41:16] You say, "I got the Holy Ghost."
[41:20] &gt;&gt; I don't think that should be said.
[41:23] You must say the Holy Ghost got me.
[41:30] Then when the Holy Ghost gets you,
[41:35] the burdens,
[41:37] the yoke is easy.
[41:44] Then you pick up the big gates of Gaza
[41:51] &gt;&gt; and park them straight to Calvary.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; And they on Mount Calvary.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; You led them at the feet of Jesus
[42:03] and pray for your enemies,
[42:06] not with a grudge.
[42:13] Because the word says pray for your
[42:14] enemies.
[42:16] So you do it but not with happiness. You
[42:18] just a grudge,
[42:22] feed your enemy.
[42:24] And you feel grieved.
[42:28] You know the word says this, let me do
[42:29] it.
[42:31] But you know you are doing it out of joy
[42:33] of obedience.
[42:38] You're doing it out of the joy of
[42:40] obedience.
[42:45] You say, "Lord, if you would bust him
[42:48] open,
[42:51] &gt;&gt; no, but with something within your
[42:53] heart,
[42:58] that dear God,
[43:02] that man is a man like I am."
[43:06] You see what's lacking in the church
[43:11] friend?
[43:13] &gt;&gt; What we need is a start all over.
[43:18] Praise the name of our Lord. The life of
[43:21] Christ himself being in us.
[43:24] Praise the name of our Lord. So now when
[43:26] the Holy Spirit is right inside us,
[43:31] he will make us do things of Jesus
[43:33] Christ.
[43:36] Now in the message what was the Holy
[43:37] Spirit given for
[43:42] it says and in the cool of evening.
[43:46] He would come down and commune with them
[43:51] and there he lost that fellowship
[43:56] because of sin
[43:59] would not let him do it.
[44:04] He was made flesh and dwelt among us
[44:09] in order that he could come back again
[44:11] to a man
[44:15] and live in man
[44:18] and restore a man
[44:22] to a state of communion with him again
[44:28] and give him back his God-given right.
[44:34] That's what he did. That's the purpose
[44:38] of the Holy Ghost.
[44:40] It is the father again,
[44:43] God dwelling in you,
[44:47] working out his plans to finish his plan
[44:51] of redemption,
[44:55] working through you,
[44:58] making you a coworker with him.
[45:02] Giving you a place,
[45:04] &gt;&gt; giving you a part of a part for your
[45:08] fallen lost brother
[45:13] and sister,
[45:15] giving you his spirit
[45:18] and his love
[45:20] to go hunt for the lost
[45:26] as he did in the garden of Eden.
[45:30] Adam, Adam, where are you?
[45:34] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Spirit does
[45:38] to a man or a woman
[45:42] when it strikes into their heart
[45:45] and it takes a B.
[45:49] There is a thirst and hungering for lost
[45:51] souls.
[45:55] Praise the name of our Lord. When the
[45:57] Holy Spirit is inside of you,
[46:00] you desire people to get saved.
[46:04] Your friends you spend time with
[46:07] you talk to them about the Lord.
[46:10] How often you challenge them to accept
[46:12] the Lord as their savior?
[46:18] How about your neighbors?
[46:20] How about those people who work on your
[46:23] project or who work on your kind of
[46:25] assignments?
[46:28] You know, maybe you go to the salon. How
[46:31] often you testify to them about the
[46:33] Lord,
[46:36] you find them watching things which are
[46:38] not appropriate.
[46:41] You're not going to rebuke at them. But
[46:43] you tell them there's something better.
[46:47] Praise the name of the Lord. There's
[46:49] something better than this.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; The Lord loves you. the people who come
[46:54] and work at maybe your shop
[46:57] or the people who do different kind of
[46:59] activities around you or they depending
[47:02] upon you to survive.
[47:05] How often do you testify to them?
[47:09] Praise the name of our Lord
[47:12] maybe you who carries you.
[47:15] How often do you testify to them about
[47:16] the Lord?
[47:20] your colleagues,
[47:21] your relatives,
[47:23] how often do you tell them about Christ?
[47:27] So when the Holy Spirit is inside of us,
[47:31] you will always move us to talk about
[47:33] Christ.
[47:36] You testify about the goodness of the
[47:38] Lord.
[47:40] You testify about the things the Lord is
[47:41] doing.
[47:44] and you desire people to be changed
[47:48] because he's putting a thirsting and
[47:50] hungering in your life
[47:54] for the lost souls. Then he says that's
[47:57] what's the matter with the meetings
[47:58] today.
[48:04] There is not enough spirit
[48:09] in touch to go for the souls of the
[48:12] lost.
[48:16] and the dying.
[48:18] It is more to make a name
[48:26] or a church or a building or a
[48:29] nomination
[48:31] instead of a soul winning program.
[48:37] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[48:40] see that the Holy Spirit
[48:42] has total preeminence in our lives.
[48:46] You know that you are doing the things
[48:48] that are pleasing to the Lord.
[48:51] You are in studying of the word. You are
[48:54] in praying.
[48:56] You are in testifying
[48:59] the life that you live
[49:01] reflecting the life of Jesus Christ
[49:03] himself.
[49:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[49:08] to another message also.
[49:10] A secondhanded robe.
[49:15] And Elijah turned around.
[49:18] The only thing that he wanted to to
[49:20] know.
[49:23] Could he ever get that promise?
[49:27] That's all he wanted.
[49:30] And he said, "Now I'm going to ask you.
[49:36] Tell you what my desire is.
[49:40] I want a double portion of your spirit
[49:42] to come upon me.
[49:51] What are you going to say?"
[49:54] Elijah
[49:55] the anointed prophet
[49:59] turned around and said
[50:02] though has asked a hard thing
[50:06] but the thing will be given to you on a
[50:08] condition.
[50:15] So is so is the Holy Ghost given to you
[50:18] on a condition.
[50:24] on conditions. If you can meet the
[50:26] condition,
[50:29] that is if you can see me while I go
[50:33] away.
[50:36] You'll have what you asked for.
[50:39] That's all Elisha wanted was the
[50:42] promise.
[50:46] Praise the name of our Lord. So Elijah
[50:48] told Elishah,
[50:51] "If you can see me being taken away from
[50:53] you,
[50:54] then you'll have the double portion of
[50:57] the spirit."
[51:00] And even as the condition for the Holy
[51:02] Spirit
[51:05] is obedience to the word of God.
[51:09] Praise the name of our Lord. That's the
[51:11] condition to the Holy Spirit. Because
[51:13] the Bible says in Acts 5:32,
[51:19] God has given the Holy Spirit
[51:23] to those that obey him.
[51:27] So that's the condition,
[51:30] your obedience to the word.
[51:33] Brother Brandham says your obedience to
[51:36] the word
[51:38] entitles you to the token.
[51:41] Praise the name of our Lord. So it's the
[51:43] condition
[51:45] Elijah told him if you can see me being
[51:47] taken out
[51:49] and the scripture says if you obey the
[51:52] word of God and the Holy Spirit comes
[51:55] down.
[51:57] Praise the name of our Lord and he keeps
[51:59] you in that obedience of the word
[52:03] walking after the word of God.
[52:08] If he know the promise and the
[52:10] conditions of the promise,
[52:17] then he kept his eyes right on Elijah.
[52:23] The way we should keep our eyes on the
[52:25] word of God,
[52:28] I can imagine somebody saying,
[52:31] "Sir, what are you bothering him for?
[52:36] I ain't got no time to talk to you.
[52:40] I'm looking straight at him.
[52:44] And today the promise many of you here
[52:48] is sick
[52:51] and the promise is to you
[52:54] if you can believe.
[52:56] You've got the promise. The promise is
[52:59] laid down here in the Bible.
[53:02] The promise is yours.
[53:05] But the trouble of it is
[53:07] you let the schools of the prophets
[53:12] and everything else call you from one
[53:15] side to the other one
[53:21] telling you, discouraging,
[53:26] telling you days of miracles is passed.
[53:31] No such a thing.
[53:33] It's mind reading.
[53:36] It's mental telepathy
[53:40] and all those things
[53:43] and you listen to it and that's the
[53:46] reason you don't receive the promise.
[53:51] Praise the name of our lord. You know
[53:53] like there are some people who believe
[53:56] it is difficult to get the Holy Spirit
[54:00] and so somebody's there all his lifetime
[54:02] said I don't know if I'll ever get the
[54:03] Holy Spirit.
[54:07] But the Bible says
[54:09] the Holy Spirit was given on the day of
[54:12] Pentecost.
[54:14] The only reason why the Holy Ghost was
[54:16] not given before
[54:20] in John chapter 7
[54:23] and then verse 39,
[54:26] you can read that scripture.
[54:30] John 7 9:39
[54:34] it says, "But this spoke he of the
[54:36] spirit which they that believe on him
[54:40] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[54:43] not yet given because that Jesus was not
[54:46] yet glorified.
[54:58] That was the condition. The Holy Ghost
[55:00] was not yet given
[55:02] because Jesus had not resurrected.
[55:05] But now our Lord resurrected
[55:08] 2,000 years ago.
[55:11] Praise the name of our Lord. So the Holy
[55:13] Spirit was released on the day of
[55:15] Pentecost.
[55:18] So there is no excuse for somebody not
[55:20] to have the Holy Spirit.
[55:23] Oh, it is hard to get the Holy Spirit.
[55:27] That is the schools of the prophets.
[55:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Brother, it
[55:34] is difficult.
[55:36] Do you know how long I took? Do you know
[55:38] how much I suffered?
[55:41] How I went to the mountain several
[55:42] nights?
[55:46] That's not the condition of getting the
[55:47] Holy Ghost.
[55:50] Praise the name of our Lord.
[55:58] No, that's not the condition.
[56:02] Praise the name of our Lord. But that's
[56:04] what people have in the mind.
[56:08] The the Bible says
[56:11] that they put burdens on people's back
[56:16] which they cannot carry. So they put a
[56:19] big thing as if it is too difficult.
[56:24] It's not that difficult.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Just obey
[56:29] the word and then the Holy Ghost comes
[56:32] down. The life of Jesus Christ himself.
[56:36] Praise the name of our Lord. Not
[56:38] brother. You know unless you go to the
[56:40] other side.
[56:47] If you don't go to the other preacher
[56:49] there,
[56:53] praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[56:55] the Holy Spirit
[56:58] comes to those who obey the word of God.
[57:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Not saying
[57:04] that unless you come to our church in
[57:06] Ginger,
[57:09] you're not going to get the Holy Ghost.
[57:12] That's wrong.
[57:14] The condition is,
[57:17] let us read Acts 5:32.
[57:24] And we are his witnesses of these
[57:27] things. And so is also the Holy Ghost
[57:30] whom God has given to them that obey
[57:32] him.
[57:40] Now, who gives the Holy Ghost?
[57:43] God whom does he give
[57:46] &gt;&gt; those who obey. So the question is why
[57:50] don't you want to obey?
[57:53] Why would you come from the world and
[57:55] you come to dis be disobedient?
[58:00] Why? Praise the name of our Lord. You
[58:03] know you accept the Lord as your savior.
[58:06] Be obedient fully
[58:09] and then he gives you his spirit.
[58:11] There's nothing difficult with that
[58:14] in John chapter 14.
[58:18] John chapter 14
[58:22] and then verse 21.
[58:27] He that has my commandments and keepeth
[58:30] them.
[58:35] In other words, you hear the word. When
[58:39] you hear the word, you are obedient to
[58:42] that word.
[58:46] Then he says,
[58:48] "It is he that loveth me.
[58:53] You've heard the word and you have
[58:56] obeyed the word.
[58:58] You love God." Then he said, "And he
[59:01] that loveth me
[59:05] shall be loved of my father,
[59:08] and I will love him,
[59:11] and I will manifest myself to him,
[59:17] more revelations,
[59:19] more manifestations,
[59:22] more grace of God,
[59:24] more leadership.
[59:26] He is manifesting himself to you.
[59:29] Praise the name of our Lord. Then in
[59:31] verse 23,
[59:33] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[59:37] "If a man love me,
[59:41] he will keep my words
[59:45] and my father will love him
[59:49] and we will come unto him
[59:53] and make our abode with him."
[59:57] Now you imagine what he's saying.
[1:00:00] If a man love me,
[1:00:03] he will keep my words.
[1:00:07] When you look at that scripture,
[1:00:10] he said the proof of love
[1:00:14] is for you to keep the word of God.
[1:00:17] And keeping the word of God, you love
[1:00:20] the word.
[1:00:22] You desire the word. You cherish the
[1:00:26] word.
[1:00:27] The way you keep money
[1:00:29] that a thief cannot steal it. So even
[1:00:32] you keep the word
[1:00:35] but demons cannot steal it
[1:00:38] by bringing unbelief
[1:00:42] because demons are birds.
[1:00:45] They come and steal the word.
[1:00:48] And then you make sure that those
[1:00:50] demons,
[1:00:51] those evil spirits, they don't come and
[1:00:54] steal the word you have in your heart.
[1:00:57] So now when the word is in your heart,
[1:01:00] you are obedient to that word.
[1:01:04] So you are keeping it. You are
[1:01:07] fulfilling it. You are like Mary.
[1:01:11] Let it be unto me according to your
[1:01:13] word.
[1:01:15] You've opened your heart to the word of
[1:01:17] God.
[1:01:19] And the word of God you've opened your
[1:01:21] heart to
[1:01:23] shows the life of Christ right inside of
[1:01:26] you.
[1:01:28] Now you see that scripture
[1:01:31] if you love me,
[1:01:34] you will keep my word and then the rest
[1:01:38] does it.
[1:01:42] God himself,
[1:01:44] I've given you my word.
[1:01:48] Keep my word. The way he told those
[1:01:50] disciples,
[1:01:52] I've given them my thy word.
[1:01:55] I have kept them by thy word.
[1:01:58] They have kept my word.
[1:02:01] Keep them through thy word.
[1:02:04] Sanctify them. Then now he says when you
[1:02:08] have the word you keep the word what is
[1:02:12] follows. He says the father will love
[1:02:15] you
[1:02:18] and when he loves you he says he will
[1:02:21] come unto you
[1:02:24] and when he comes unto you
[1:02:26] he comes and makes his abboard.
[1:02:32] He loves you. He comes to you. He comes
[1:02:36] and makes his abboard.
[1:02:42] That's the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:02:45] Nothing complicated about it.
[1:02:47] It's the same. It's the same kind of
[1:02:50] call at the beginning.
[1:02:54] You know, accept the Lord Jesus as your
[1:02:57] personal savior.
[1:02:59] Then you repent. You're baptized in the
[1:03:02] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:04] Then the Bible says
[1:03:06] every one of you be baptized in the name
[1:03:09] of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:11] What follows? You shall receive the gift
[1:03:14] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:16] No complication about it.
[1:03:19] No going through 10 years fast.
[1:03:24] No going through you know sleepless
[1:03:26] nights first.
[1:03:29] Now it doesn't mean that you may not do
[1:03:31] that. But others are not conditions.
[1:03:36] God is not asking you to first suffer.
[1:03:45] You know, at the cross I was nailed, the
[1:03:48] pain I felt. Oh, until you go through
[1:03:51] that,
[1:03:53] the only thing he wants you to do is to
[1:03:56] die to your selfish desires.
[1:04:01] That's all. Die yourself desires.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've turned my mind from the
[1:04:07] things of the world.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've turned my mind from what I
[1:04:12] personally desire.
[1:04:15] Here I am, Lord. I want to take what you
[1:04:18] are telling me.
[1:04:20] Praise the name of the Lord. That's what
[1:04:22] he desires. A change of your mind.
[1:04:26] And to repent is to turn away from where
[1:04:29] you're going.
[1:04:32] So you reject the past
[1:04:35] like the two sons. The Bible talks about
[1:04:39] the Bible talks about two sons.
[1:04:42] The father told them go to the vineard.
[1:04:47] And then the first son said
[1:04:51] I will not go.
[1:04:54] Afterwards
[1:04:56] he repented
[1:04:58] and he went.
[1:05:00] He went to the second son,
[1:05:02] go to the vineard.
[1:05:04] The second son said, "I will go."
[1:05:09] But he didn't go. Then Jesus asked those
[1:05:12] Pharisees,
[1:05:14] "Who did the will of the father?
[1:05:17] Praise the name of Lord." He was
[1:05:20] bringing in the example of the
[1:05:21] prostitutes and the publicans
[1:05:27] versus the religious people.
[1:05:36] When the prostitutes came to John the
[1:05:38] Baptist,
[1:05:41] what shall we do?
[1:05:44] When the religious people came to John
[1:05:45] the Baptist,
[1:05:49] who are you?
[1:05:54] When the publicans came to Jesus,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; the prostitute when they came
[1:06:02] they repented.
[1:06:05] When the religious people came to Jesus,
[1:06:09] who gave you that power?
[1:06:12] So they despise it.
[1:06:15] They take it lightly.
[1:06:17] But now there what the people they call
[1:06:19] sinners.
[1:06:21] They want to be serious.
[1:06:25] Lord,
[1:06:27] change me. Zakaria
[1:06:32] Zakas a publican.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You know, he said what I'm going to do
[1:06:37] to repay back.
[1:06:40] He was not like the other Pharisee
[1:06:44] said, "This man, is he really righteous?
[1:06:48] Praise the name of our Lord. It's all
[1:06:50] about obedience
[1:06:53] and that's what the Lord desires from
[1:06:55] us.
[1:06:57] Be obedient to the word of God.
[1:07:00] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:07:02] the spirit dwells in you.
[1:07:05] Praise the name of our Lord. I want so I
[1:07:08] can finish.
[1:07:11] Now there's this message.
[1:07:16] He says
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; he was confirming it.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; He told the body of Jesus
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; apart
[1:07:30] taking the spirit
[1:07:33] lifted up the body to the right hand of
[1:07:35] the throne of God
[1:07:40] down the other part
[1:07:43] and sent down the other part.
[1:07:49] The part he tore out
[1:07:52] the spirit upon us
[1:07:56] which is called the Holy Spirit
[1:08:00] and the very life that was in Christ
[1:08:04] is in you.
[1:08:07] That shows
[1:08:09] he is your redeemer.
[1:08:12] He's adopted you unto God.
[1:08:15] And now we are sons and daughters of God
[1:08:21] with the spirit of God.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Works that I do shall you do
[1:08:27] also.
[1:08:30] Greater than this shall you do.
[1:08:34] For I go to my father.
[1:08:38] The spirit that was in him
[1:08:41] is on you
[1:08:44] eternal life. He is the giver of eternal
[1:08:47] life.
[1:08:49] He is a redeemer
[1:08:51] to bring back that which fell in the
[1:08:54] fall
[1:08:56] in the human race
[1:08:59] to bring back to God.
[1:09:03] And the spirit that was in Christ
[1:09:06] is in you.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; And if the spirit of Dillion
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; was in me,
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; I would have guns.
[1:09:19] You know that was a man who liked guns
[1:09:21] like nothing.
[1:09:24] the moon.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Then he said,
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; "If the spirit if if the spirit of an
[1:09:31] artist was in me,
[1:09:36] I would paint pictures.
[1:09:39] If the spirit of God is in you,
[1:09:44] the works of Christ you will do."
[1:09:49] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; That is right. The life that was in him
[1:09:55] is in you.
[1:09:58] Then he says, "Transfer the life from
[1:10:01] anything to another thing."
[1:10:06] If you could take the life of a pumpkin
[1:10:11] and then put it in a watermelon,
[1:10:16] it would bear pumpkins.
[1:10:20] Exactly.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; You take the life out of a peach tree
[1:10:26] and put it in a pe tree, it will bear
[1:10:28] pitches. Like you like you take the life
[1:10:31] of oranges
[1:10:34] and put it in a mango tree.
[1:10:37] Then that monkey will bear oranges
[1:10:41] because the life that's in the tree
[1:10:46] gives the evidence of it.
[1:10:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Now for us
[1:10:53] who were born in sin,
[1:10:55] shaped in iniquity. So if we get the
[1:10:58] life of the righteous one,
[1:11:02] our Lord Jesus Christ without sin, we
[1:11:07] get his life
[1:11:09] and then it is in us. Then we shall bear
[1:11:13] the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:15] The works that I do shall you do.
[1:11:19] You bear the fruit of the spirit.
[1:11:23] You have the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. You fulfill
[1:11:28] all the promises of God.
[1:11:34] Why? When the Holy Ghost is in us,
[1:11:37] he does the works of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:40] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:11:42] the essence of being saved.
[1:11:46] Is it not my life anymore,
[1:11:49] but it is the life of Jesus Christ?
[1:11:53] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[1:11:55] should always be our desire.
[1:11:58] Lord, give me life. Lord, let me live
[1:12:01] your life.
[1:12:03] When the Holy Spirit comes in us, we
[1:12:06] shall always do the word of God. We
[1:12:09] shall always do the will of God.
[1:12:12] No longer us who live
[1:12:14] but Christ that lives in us.
[1:12:18] Praise the name of our Lord. May God
[1:12:20] bless you.
[1:12:22] Amen.
[1:12:26] Let us sing that song. There is honey in
[1:12:28] the rock.
[1:12:32] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:12:37] Oh my brother, do you know the Savior
[1:12:44] who is wonderous,

[1:15:19] you. Oh hallelujah.

[1:17:15] you.
[1:17:18] Live your soul for the blood to cover.
[1:17:27] There is money in the road for you.
[1:17:34] When the savior calls, may praise the
[1:17:36] name of our lord as each of us go to
[1:17:38] pray. Amen.
[1:17:41] When the savior
[1:17:43] [Music]
[1:17:45] calls,
[1:17:46] I will answer.
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:51] When he calls
[1:17:54] for me, I will be
