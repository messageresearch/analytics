That's planted by the Lord. Amen. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. [applause] Amen. name of our Lord Jesus Christ and of our brother Williamover. Amen. need another mic. &gt;&gt; So let us turn to our Bibles in the book of second Peter chapter 2. Second Peter chapter 2 from verse one. The Bible says But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that brought them that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. Monkeychech. And many shall follow their penicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. And through covetousness shall they with fain words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingers not and their domination slumbers not. For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and deliver them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto to judgement. and spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in &gt;&gt; bring in the flood unto the world of the ungodly. and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly. and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that Righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with unlawful deeds. The Lord knows how to deliver the ungodly. Rather, the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished. May God bless you of his word. You may be. I want to draw our text from verse four. which says that for God spared not the angels that sinned but cast them to down to hell and deliver them into the chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment. So I want to preach on being in the chains of darkness. Praise the name of the Lord. Being in chains of darkness. Praise the name of the Lord. And you know darkness itself is bondage. Praise the name of our Lord. We were born in sin and then you know shaped in iniquity. From our first birth, we are born into the kingdom of darkness. Praise the name of the Lord. You You come to the world desiring to do evil things. By nature, you are an enemy of God. You know the nature of the spirit, you know, which is the soul. is actually of darkness. When you are when you are born here on earth, &gt;&gt; you are rebellious with the things of God. You know before God, you are dead. You are living in darkness. Now in the book of Acts, the Lord was telling Paul to go and preach the gospel. And then in Acts chapter 26 and then we go to verse 16. He says, &gt;&gt; "But rise and stand upon thy feet, for I've appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness of both these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in which I will appear unto thee. to delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles and to whom now I send thee. to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. But you praise the name of our Lord. So it says that Paul is commissioned to go and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ so that the eyes of the people are opened. In other words, they come to the knowledge of the truth. Praise the name of our Lord. And then they turn from darkness. You know the way of life. the things that they have, you know, believe in. If we can get another mic, praise the name of our Lord. So, he was telling them to open their eyes. They live the ways of Satan so that they can turn to God. So, our first bath puts us into the kingdom of darkness. Our first bath makes us to be enemies of God. Now when we hear the gospel of Jesus Christ, it opens our eyes, it makes us come to the realization you know that we are in sin. And now when you realize that you are in sin, then you repent of your sins, you turn away from the evil things and then you follow God. Praise the name of our Lord. And this is the desire of God that nobody should perish in sin. Nobody should perish in darkness. Now we see here in the Bible here the Bible has told us that there are some false prophets who privately or secretly come amongst us. You know they come in still you know you don't know and you don't realize that they are false and then they come amongst us. And then they start teaching things contrary to what we have believed. Now if you have known the truth, YOU CAME out of darkness and then you have come to the light. Praise the name of our Lord. And then you walk in the light. like the children of Israel. THEY CAME OUT OF THE DARKNESS of Egypt and they were under the glory of God and they kept on following the leadership of Moses. them along the way. Like last we preached about the opposing spirits in the third exodus and we see the same thing which happens now that the Bible says that a mixed multitude came out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; In other words, THEY WERE NOT CONVERTED. You know there were people who came out. There are people who came out but then they could think about where they came from. Like people who leave the world and they come into salvation but they don't want to let go of the things of the world. They feel they are missing drinking. They feel they are missing nightclub. they feel they missing these kind of strange things. So they come out but they are not fully delivered from those things. And along the way they become a stumbling block. And so these people whose hearts have not been fully turned from evil, they are the ones who are easily deceived. They are the ones who are easily deceived. Praise the name of our Lord. Now the Bible has told us back here in first Peter chap 2 second Peter chapter 2, the Bible says that they bring in damnable heresies. 1 Peter 2 second Peter chapter 2 verse1 you read it since you're not getting the right word. Now they come in privately and then they can start storytelling. The Bible says giving us fables. Like they were saying, we used to get satisfied in Egypt. We had graves in Egypt. But you see this place here, we are being wasted. They make THE PEOPLE FOCUS BACK TO THE things of the world. And last week we talked about Kora, you know, how he he was resisting the leadership of Moses Balam, how he was uniting the the the the children of Israel with the Moabites. And you know there are s spirits that come during the Exodus. But the purpose of these spirits is to bring people into the chains of darkness. Now the Bible says because we know we all came from darkness. But now when you come into light and then you reject the light, you get into everlasting chains of darkness. In other words, you are eternally separated from God. Praise the name of our Lord. Now, in the message, the souls that are in prison, he says, Jesus said, "Many will come to me in that day and say, I have done all these things. They eat mana in the wilderness." And Jesus Jesus said they are everyone eternally separated. They are dead. That is eternally God. They perished right there in the wilderness. You remember Hebrews chapter 6 once that was once made known the truth and refuse to walk in it there is no more repentance for them. See a borderline believer when the truth is presented to a person for the last time and they refuse to walk in it. They refuse to receive it according to the book of Hebrews. There is not even nothing in the world that can ever save them. They are finished. No repentance, no redemption. There is nothing left for them. What is that? What is their condition? They in everlasting chains of darkness. In other words, they are in the condition like the demons are. You know they can never come to the knowledge of the truth. They can never turn away from their evil ways. Then he says they are eternally separated. The Bible said so looking for the fearful fire and indignation which shall devour the adversary. I mean, and when the truth of the gospel has been proven, thoroughly vindicated, and then turn around and walk from it, they are finished. That is all. It is awful. But I have to tell it. Remember the angels which kept not their first estate but left there in prison but left there in that prison house in darkness. Where the world is walking today in the same prison. There is no repentance. Remember a few years ago. I said when I come down from Chicago, &gt;&gt; either America will receive it this year or she won't receive it at all. See where she has gone. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Let us turn to the book of Hebrews chapter 6. And then we go to verse four. For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tested of the heavenly gift and we are made partakers of the Holy Ghost. And I've tested the good word of God and the powers of the world to come. If they shall fall away to renew them unto repentance, seeing they crucify to themselves the son of God aresh and put him to open shame. So these people who have known the truth and the Bible says now here that it is impossible for those who were once enlightened. In other words, their eyes were opened. And then the Bible says they have tested of the heavenly gift. In other words, the blessings of God and they were made partakers of the Holy Ghost. Now to be a partaker, in other words, they had a benefit of the Holy Spirit. They can give a testimony. God healed me here. God delivered me here. God used me in this kind of situation. You know, they would maybe get gifts of the Holy Spirit, not the life of the Holy Spirit. Like in Matthew chapter 7, these people had partaken of the Holy Spirit. They were speaking in tong. Hear what I'm saying? Now the Bible says they were partakers. Now in other words, they they took a gift or they received like a blessing of the Holy Ghost. In other words, they were blessed like in healing. Maybe they spoke in tongues. Maybe they prophesied or they prayed for the people and got healed by the Holy Spirit. Let us put it this other way. The 12 spies when they went to the land of promise. When they went to Cananan's land, each of them came with the fruits of the land. Praise the name of our Lord. When they came back with the fruits that there is a land beyond this place, evidence they came with the fruits and the congregation that the land is there. Praise the name of our Lord. You know they showed it. They gave a testimony that these are the fruits of the land like a divine healing. Divine healing reflects living without death. In other words, it shows that there is life eternal. But you can be healed today and then you fall sick the following day and even you die. BUT THAT POWER OF GOD that has healed you is a forward test. You know, like they got the fruits from the land and they were eating them from the wilderness. But now the 10 spies, they gave a false testimony. We cannot take over that land. But yet they had eaten of the fruit. So this is the same thing of partaking of the Holy Spirit but then rejecting the life of the Holy Spirit. In other words, THEY WERE NOT BAPTIZED WITH THE Holy Spirit but they had the Holy Spirit to use them maybe in speaking in tongues, in prophesying, in doing miracles. Mthew chapter 7 where I say that go away from me you workers of iniquity. So this is what the Bible is talking about. The children in the wilderness. They had partaken of the blessings of God. Every day they were eating mana. Angels food. They had a pillar of fire before them. They had a cloud of glory before them. They had, you know, quills falling for them. So all these were blessings of God. They parttook of these blessings of God. But then they turned around. We cannot go and possess the land. So he says they were eternally separated from God. So that is the same condition that we live in today that there are spirits. There are people who come in and they want to turn you from the message of the hour and turn you to things which are wrong. Praise the name of the Lord. The cororas ah brother Brham is not right. That is a corora. Praise the name of God. All these are fables. Because the Bible says, you know, they come and then they tell you that the message is a fable. But what they are saying are the ones which are fables. So they want you to turn your heart from the message and that's what Conor was doing telling Moses who are you all of us are holy and he resisted Moses. So these same spirits are existing now. Praise the name of our Lord. Now we need to be very conscious because the spirits have come OUT AND THE BIBLE says they have come amongst us like we have a number of scenarios here. There are people who come in our mid and tell you you're not meant to come to church, stay at home and play your tapes only. You shouldn't give them your ear. You shouldn't follow them. Then there are others who come who have a confession there. Ask them, "Have you told the pastor about it? Praise the name of Lord. You don't just run because somebody has told you that there is a a meeting here. Like the Bible says when they tell you he's in the desert, he's in the secret chamber. The Bible says don't go. It's your protection. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, we are living in days of subility. Now let us go to Jeremiah chapter 28. Praise the name of our Lord. Now the Bible says verse one. And it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the fourth year and in the fifth month, that Haniah, the son of Auza the prophet, which was of Gibon, spoke unto me in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying, [music] Gib, thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. Within two full years will I bring again in this place all the vessels of the Lord's house that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took away from this place and carried them to Babylon. Now Jeremiah, the true prophet of the day, the messenger of the day given them the true word of God. said 70 years you'll be in Babylon and he said you must obey that in obeying that you are going to be safe but in rejecting it you are going to be destroyed and then he told them if you you say that you are going to be here you are going to be destroyed of the sword You're going to be destroyed of pestilence. You're going to be destroyed of hunger. Their safety was going to Babylon because God wanted the land to have her Sabbath. Praise the name of our Lord. Now, Haniah, a prophet of God. Now Haniah was not an idol worshipper and this is what the devil does. He gets one amongst us. Ah that brother is a good minister of the message. Let us go and hear and here there was a conversion in the temple and we like going to conventions. Find out first. Find out. Don't just run because you have been invited to a convention. Because this convention was in the temple in Jerusalem, the priests of God were there. The princes were there. The people were there. Even Jeremiah was invited into. Now they are subtile spirits that they can bring a true Jeremiah and they give him only one service in the whole convention. But all the services and the days are false teachers. They give Jeremiah only one hour. Even Jeremiah is coming. to make the conversion look right. We should be careful, what meetings we go to. Praise the name of just run. We have enough food here. Praise the name of we have enough food. You know, there are some people then they say, you know, we don't have overnight every Friday. Then they said, "Let us cross the road because they have every Friday." You are going to end up being deceived. We don't have morning glory. We don't have lunch hour. Let me go here where I can have lunch hour. You have enough to hear. Praise the name of the Lord. We record all our sermons here. We record them. We put them on our platform. WhatsApp. We have five radio programs every week. Do you take time to listen to all these things? Do you take time to listen to all these things? We have morning exaltation. Do you take time and then you say let me listen to what the Holy Spirit is inspiring to be said today. Praise the name of our Lord. Now there is a scenario in some place and then they were telling the people you come to the mountain and we pray and then they organize a weekend maybe once in a month. Then they collect you from different places and Jesus said you shall not worship God on this mountain. Praise the name of Allah. Is taking you back to the mountain. Praise the name of Allah. So there are a lot of deception that has come amongst us that we need to be careful. Where do you feed from? Praise the name of Lord. Where do you feed from? Like this was a conversion in the temple. The princes were there. The people were there. The priests were there. Even Jeremiah was invited. But the conversion, the main preacher was Hania. And he said, "Two years." Contrary to the message of the hour and we can have the same spirits come among the stars that can draw you from the truth and turn and then you find yourself you are going by something wrong. Praise the name of the Lord. I just want to read some quote here in the message. Does God change his mind about his word? He says, "And we find that we find out that Balam went down there and begin to teach the people and he had an error. But Balam was a prophet of God. He would prophesy such wonderful prophecies. But there was something wrong in him. Then he says, "And he ran in the way of Balam, how that he did and taught Balac, and the children of Israel committed adultery, and the plague struck the nation of Israel. the people and thousands of them died in one day and while okay we shall jump that &gt;&gt; sorry okay &gt;&gt; then he says &gt;&gt; but what happened &gt;&gt; he succeeded he succeeded in weakening Israel what did He do he weakened their camp. God let him go and weakened their camp and it polluted the whole camp. That's what they do. You know, if you want the Holy Ghost, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, and everybody jumps. I said that since I've jumped, I felt somehow good. I have the Holy Ghost. They weaken. They They faith you into something which is true. You take the things of God lightly. And then he says, &gt;&gt; "And when when some doctrine start the Bible truth, it pollutes the whole camp. Somebody raise up with a different idea like Kora and say, "Well, this you know that the other I got a different idea &gt;&gt; it pollutes the whole camp like we can say the whole church and that's what done the whole church camp today teaching as he did weakening the whole camp of Kadesh for Kadesh Baadesh The word showed down when they got to Kadesha then the weakening of the camp then they come back then he said remember they had eat angels food they had the word of God every night made manifest and they eat the They drink from the rock. They did all seen miracles. They watched Moses and seen his word, his prophecies, everything. And then finally when they listen to the false teacher come among them and teach wrong. He weakened the camp and prospered by it. Praise the name of Lord. So we need to be careful. You don't just run find out. Who are these people? Praise the name of Lord. They don't just run. You know, I've taken long without in being having a convention. At home, we have only one day's meeting, but I want to go to a residential convention somewhere. Be conscious. Praise the name of the Lord. Haniah and his team they organized a conversion. Let us go back to Jeremiah chapter 28. and he said two years I wouldn't want to hear that message said years but the other prophet says who doesn't want to hear that true good amen god has reduced our burden and to demonstrate that he meant what he meant. He went and got the yoke of wood from Jeremiah AND BROKE IT. OH, TWO YEARS. I never said, "Amen. Going to come back. My grandmother is going to come back. God has done us so good. like the prosperity gospel that is taking place. Lord, this year I'm increased with good, I have need of nothing. And somebody feels happy about that. Praise the name of the Lord. So now Jeremiah just came to the convention and said, "Amen." What would he say? They can even lynch you. So the Bible says in verse five, &gt;&gt; then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Ananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of God, Now, so Jeremiah questioned, &gt;&gt; you know, he he kind of like warned him and he told him, &gt;&gt; verse six, Even the prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord do so. The Lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of the Lord's house and all that carried away captive from Babylon into this place. Nevertheless, hear now this word that I speak in thine ear and the ears of all the people. The prophets that have been before me and before you of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilence. The prophets which prophesied peace. When the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known that the Lord has truly sent him. Then the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck and break it. saying, "Thus says the Lord, even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years." And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. Now you see is the main preacher and then they bring in Jeremiah to just say the meeting was good. Even Jeremiah pastor Jeremiah was there. Give him one service. He can't remove everything has preached preaching. The set time is over. Then Haniah comes back with a great demonstration and breaks the yoke of Jeremiah. Two full years and then the conversion closes. And then you come back to church with contrary mind. &gt;&gt; I think what I heard there it was the true which he preaches I doubt from when if you didn't go and eat from the wrong stuff. Praise the name of our lord. And that's what the devil does. comes in privately. I think here there is something wrong. I think maybe if I can get a job and go to the other place or you become too busy to come to church and see where you can get where you can be fed by. But the Bible says Haniah taught people rebellion. Praise the name of our Lord. When God has said something and you hear something contrary, it is teaching you rebellion. And when you are taught rebellion and you follow rebellion, you end up into chains of darkness. because you have despised what has helped you. You have left it. You get yourself into bondage. So now God told Jeremiah in verse 13, "Go and tell Han rather Haniah, go and tell Haniah, saying, Thus says the Lord, thou hast broken the yolks of wood, but thou shalt make for them yolks of iron." So from wood, iron, no worstation. You've been having some form of weakness which you are praying to God to help you overcome and then you go and hear the false teachers yourself into greater weakness. Brother Brandham said, "False teaching pollutes the camp. It pollutes your heart. It weakens you further. You become too weak until you end up rejecting the word of God. You start living like the rest of them." So he told him, "Make the one of There was greater bondage than what you have been in. Now in verse 15, then thus said the prophet Jeremiah unto Haniah the prophet here. Now Haniah, the Lord has not sent you, but you make the people to trust in a lie. So false teachers are very smart. They are so smart in their form of delivery until you would give them the ear and the Bible says they were renown men. Maybe when they would come to speak, it was very eloquent. It was so demonstrative. But now when Moses comes to speak, he's a stammer until you get tired of hearing him speak. His speech is just flat. But the other one know how to choose to turn this to and they excite your ears. The Bible says preachers having itching ears. We'll come back and hear that which when you go to most of these funerals, you know they just talk about stories. This fable here, the other there, the other one there. Praise the name of God. Now in verse 16, therefore thus says the Lord, behold, I'll cast thee from off the face of the earth. This year, thou shalt die because you have taught rebellion against the Lord. false teachers. Anything contrary to the message of the hour is teaching you rebellion against God. So if you hear anything contrary, put it aside because it has come to take you into the chains of darkness. Praise the name of the Lord. Let us go to second Peter chapter one just not enough. But I want so we can wind up within the next 15 minutes or so. Now we see here that every other time the truth has always been resisted. The truth has always been talked evil against. Now in 1 second 2 Peter 1:15 he says, "Moreover, I will endeavor that you may be able for after my disease to have these things always in remembrance." Then he says, "The world says we have followed fables, but we have not followed cunningly devised fables of the message of the hour. when we made known unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. So he's talking about these things that they are true. When brother Brham talks about the cloud, how the seven angels left the cloud in the sky. It is not able. It is not the airplanes that put that cloud in the sky. It is not it is not artificial intelligence. When the pillar of fire appeared on his head, it is not a photo shooting, but this is what the devil is spreading around so that they weaken your faith and you disregard the message that we have received. So he says these things are true. Don't hear somebody who tells you it is wrong. No, those are dans and coras. No, they are false teachers. Put them aside. Praise the name of So now he says we have not followed fables but we have followed the truth. And then the Bible says in verse 19, &gt;&gt; for we hope we we also have a sure word of prophecy. A sure word of prophecy. The prophet, the message says or the Bible says IN THE DAYS OF THE VOICE of the seventh angel shall begin to sound. All the God should be finished. We are living in the end time pass. That is a sure word of prophecy. Praise the name of our Lord. The truth has been revealed to us. Then how do you say the truth has not been revealed to us? Praise the name of our Lord. And then he continues to say that you take heed as a light shines in the darkness. That same verse. Now there is a lot of darkness. There's a lot of opposition against the message. We know outsiders opposite. But if we get opposition from within is more destructive than the one from outside. The dan's coming in the camp. Balam's coming into the camp more destruction. Praise the name of the Lord. We need to be careful where we feed from. Don't just run to go to a conversion. Find out. I've been invited here. There's a brother who fellowshipped with us. He has invited me to a meeting somewhere. Praise the name of our Lord. There are some people who are no longer coming to church because of that. They're comfortable sitting at home because they have been taught different. Praise the name of our Lord. So we need to be conscious that he may be destroying your soul. Praise the name of our Lord. Verse 20. Knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Praise the name of Lord. Let us go to Jude as I finish. &gt;&gt; Verse three to verse seven. Jude says, "Beloved, I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation. It was needful for me to write unto you and exalt you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. He says contain take time read the message books. Praise the name of take time. Praise the name of By the way. Take time read the message book. Praise the name of our Lord. Like if I'm [laughter] not talking about that praise the name of our Lord the way you sit down I'm going to do this and read the message. Sit and hear the message. All your mind to these things not. Praise the name of Lord because the enemy is fighting and is so sub is attacking inside and outside. They attacking everywhere. Praise the name of the Lord. So you need to take time to be honestly content for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Why? Verse four. He says, "For there are certain men who crept in how unaware has sent this one to you know I've read this message book but you know here brother made a mistake but you've already given him your heart crept in unaware the Bible says they were before ordained to condemnation. But for you don't know that God says this one here is like Pharaoh unodly man. They don't show what they do, but then you just believe what they telling you because the Bible says there are walls in the sheep skin. So you see the skin comes to church, there's a minister, maybe he has this place this place &gt;&gt; and is a wolf. And then he says, you just go there turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, denying the only Lord and our Lord Jesus Christ. He puts us to remembrance. Verse five, that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt. Afterward destroyed them that believed not. Why? There were false teachers amongst them. Prophets among them teaching rebellion teaching the people that we are one of the feast of white women were dancing. Everybody picked one, you know, coming in an awareness and brought destruction in the camp. Then another example, verse six, and the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorra and the cities about them like in a like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, and set forth an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Praise the name of Lord. So we are living at the end time. There are spirits that are opposing our third exodus. They come amongst us. We need to be very careful. Because these spirits use people to make sure that we go back into the chains of darkness to make us reject what we believe. But the message that we have is our only place of atonement in the name of our Lord. Our atonement, our forgiveness of sins, our deliverance from unbelief is in the message of God. That's what we need to hold tight and don't allow to be swayed aside. May God bless you. Amen. Amen. [applause] Let us sing this song and each of us can pray. I can hear my savior calling.
