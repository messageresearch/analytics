[16:14] father in the name of Jesus Christ
[16:16] we want to thank you Lord for this
[16:19] evening
[16:20] give praise and honor to your holy names
[16:35] speak to us
[16:38] according to your Divine Purpose
[16:50] and directing us
[16:53] and Lord you may help us to walk in your
[16:58] paste the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:03] you know amen Amina agreed in the name
[17:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:09] to turn to Genesis chapter 16.
[17:15] we're reading from verse 1 to verse 6.
[17:21] so the Bible says
[17:23] now Sarai Abraham's wife bear him no
[17:27] children and she had an handmade an
[17:30] Egyptian whose name was Hagar
[17:33] foreign
[17:43] behold now the Lord has restrained me
[17:46] from bearing I pray thee go in
[17:50] unto my maid it may be that I may obtain
[17:53] children by her and Abraham hack into
[17:56] the voice of Sarah Salah
[18:00] mukama and this is
[18:15] made the Egyptian after Abraham had
[18:18] drilled train years in the land of
[18:20] Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram
[18:24] to be his wife
[18:42] and he went in unto her and she
[18:44] conceived and when she saw that she had
[18:48] conceived her mistress was despised in
[18:51] her eyes
[18:52] Abraham
[19:03] my wrong be upon thee I have given my
[19:07] maid into thy person and when she saw
[19:10] that she had conceived I was despised In
[19:13] Her Eyes the Lord judged between me and
[19:16] thee now is
[19:32] all right Behold thy maid is in thy hand
[19:36] do unto as it pleases and when Sarah
[19:39] dealt hardly with her she fled from her
[19:42] face
[19:59] praise the name of the Lord
[20:03] I just want to take less than one hour
[20:05] then
[20:07] our time has gone
[20:10] I want to preach on handling challenges
[20:13] in your marriage
[20:18] handling challenges in your marriage
[20:22] is the name of our Lord so we see a very
[20:26] interesting story of Abraham and Sarah
[20:31] Ibrahim you know they had spent many
[20:34] years without any charge
[20:38] and then we need also to know
[20:41] that challenges do exist in every
[20:44] marriage
[20:50] you know like in this marriage of
[20:52] Abraham and Sarah
[20:54] they were not giving birth to children
[20:58] they were barrenness and then you find
[21:01] that in some other marriages
[21:03] maybe their problem is lack of finances
[21:09] they need some marriages they don't have
[21:13] a home where they call home
[21:18] they are just all the time afraid
[21:22] praise the name of our Lord like there
[21:25] is a brother get your Uganda you know he
[21:27] was living in somebody's house
[21:30] and then now it reached a time after a
[21:34] number of years
[21:37] the owners of the house sold it
[21:42] and now this brother was stuck Oregon
[21:45] don't know and the people who bought him
[21:48] told him leave the house
[21:50] when they say he's not leaving the house
[21:53] they started planting things near the
[21:56] house
[21:57] so that the animals of this brother can
[22:00] eat those things and they try to push
[22:02] him out
[22:05] and then they started trying to obstruct
[22:07] his interests
[22:12] so to them that was a big Challenge
[22:15] and then in some areas you find that you
[22:18] have bad neighborhoods
[22:22] every time they are against you
[22:25] you see and then in some areas you know
[22:29] you have you find families
[22:32] where they have poorly raised their
[22:34] children
[22:37] you know so when you talk about children
[22:39] to them it is a shame
[22:43] foreign you know it's challenges still
[22:46] so Moses then others abandoned you find
[22:48] that they are relatives we are not in
[22:50] Ganda you know maybe the family of their
[22:53] wife or the family of the husband
[22:57] the relatives are so problematic
[23:01] you know they have no respect all the
[23:05] time they are looking for issues against
[23:06] their their family
[23:09] those are also issues
[23:12] again you get again in another family
[23:16] suspicion is always very hard
[23:20] the husband thinks when the wife is
[23:22] always with another man um
[23:26] when the wife also thinks when the man
[23:29] is always also with another woman
[23:32] the person is watching over under
[23:34] suspicious
[23:38] challenges then again you get in another
[23:41] home
[23:42] the problem of sickness more
[24:38] places of work become a problem for a
[24:41] marriage
[24:48] or if not that's not the issue
[24:52] one of the workers
[24:57] now it becomes a problem are you going
[25:00] to leave work because of saving your
[25:02] marriage what are you going to do
[25:06] problems everywhere
[25:09] and then there are also other challenges
[25:11] which are nowadays common while it works
[25:14] you find that maybe the husband is
[25:16] working in Kampala
[25:19] and maybe the wife is working in foreign
[25:57] foreign
[26:11] and then verse 19. the Canada
[26:16] praise the name of our Lord
[26:21] say you're welcome
[26:27] he was preaching but today a new church
[26:30] there America will happen
[26:34] so in first John chapter 3 verse 19.
[26:39] the Bible says and hereby we know that
[26:43] we are of the truth and shall assure our
[26:48] hearts before him
[26:53] first John chapter 3 and then verse 19.
[26:57] coutinho could take
[27:00] goodness
[27:05] okay
[27:12] for if our heart condemn us
[27:16] God is greater than our heart and knows
[27:20] all things
[27:22] foreign
[27:32] beloved if our heart condemn us not then
[27:37] we have confidence toward God
[27:40] about that
[27:51] and whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[27:55] because we keep his Commandments and do
[27:58] those things that are pleasing in his
[28:01] side
[28:08] and this is his Commandment that we
[28:11] should believe on the name of his son
[28:13] Jesus Christ and love one another as he
[28:18] gave us commandment
[28:20] foreign
[28:49] foreign
[29:59] it is
[30:01] and now when Abraham did so and the
[30:04] hunger is so that she has she was she
[30:06] was pregnant
[30:08] then she immediately started despising
[30:11] Sarah masala
[30:14] now and you see that sometimes we go
[30:17] through life challenges yes
[30:23] it was a challenge
[30:26] we also have different challenges in our
[30:28] lives
[30:29] we have different challenges in our
[30:32] marriage
[30:34] different challenges at our homes
[30:37] and then when you have that challenge
[30:40] how do you handle that challenge
[30:44] so that by Abraham going to Hagar one
[30:49] will be a solution
[30:51] but it became a worse
[30:54] problems
[30:57] she created a serious problems
[31:02] you know sometimes we think that he
[31:04] needed this you know yet that thing may
[31:08] not be necessary
[31:11] but then your mind is fixed on that
[31:13] thing
[31:43] we see that even when he when he
[32:17] foreign
[32:45] when we got to Genesis chapter 15.
[32:50] praise the name of our Lord
[32:57] in Genesis chapter 15 and then verse 1.
[33:02] the Bible says
[33:07] in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am
[33:11] thy shield and thy exceeding great
[33:14] rewards
[33:24] and Abram said Lord God what will thou
[33:27] give me saying I go childless and the
[33:30] steward of my house is this elieza of
[33:33] Damascus is
[33:43] and that Brahm said behold to me though
[33:45] has given no seed and law one born in my
[33:49] house is my hair is
[34:01] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[34:04] look now toward heaven and tell the
[34:07] Stars if thou are able to number them
[34:09] and he said unto him so shall thy seed
[34:13] be named
[34:21] [Music]
[34:25] and he believed in the Lord and he
[34:28] counted it to him for righteousness
[34:56] you know when we read the promises of
[34:59] God what he has given unto us are we
[35:04] patient
[35:05] can we wait on the Lord concerning that
[35:08] issue
[35:10] oh you know you try to devise a way
[35:15] how to handle this issue how to handle
[35:18] the other issues how to handle the other
[35:20] issues we see that even Isaac and
[35:23] Rebecca were also buried
[35:26] let us go to Genesis chapter 25.
[35:31] and then we read in the
[35:33] verse 19.
[35:37] and these are the generations of Isaac
[35:40] Abraham's son Abraham begat Isaac is
[35:48] and Isaac was 40 years old when he took
[35:52] Rebecca to wife the daughter of Bethel
[35:55] the Syrian of padaram the sister of
[35:58] Laban the syrians
[36:11] and Isaac entreated the Lord for his
[36:14] wife because she was Barren and the Lord
[36:17] was interested of him and Rebecca his
[36:21] wife conceived is
[36:30] now when we read in verse 26 the Bible
[36:34] says and after that came his brother out
[36:37] and his hand took a hold on Esau's Hill
[36:40] and his name was called Jacob and Isaac
[36:44] Isaac was three score years old when she
[36:47] bear them
[36:50] [Music]
[37:07] so Isaac married when he was 40 years
[37:20] not giving birth
[37:24] 20 years
[37:27] Rebecca was barren
[37:30] and then now Isaac the Bible says
[37:33] and treated the Lord for the condition
[37:36] of his wife
[37:39] and the Bible says when Isaac entreated
[37:43] of the Lord
[37:46] instead of him many
[37:50] many conceived
[37:52] and now that's how we should also be
[37:55] handling our challenges
[37:58] praise the name of our Lord whatever
[38:00] challenge you have at home
[38:02] bring it to the Lord in prayer
[38:07] whatever situation it may be a problem
[38:11] of barrenness
[38:14] bring it to the Lord in prayer like now
[38:16] Isaac he brought the issue of barrenness
[38:19] to God and say Lord praise the name of
[38:24] our Lord you blessed marriage and then
[38:27] you said be fruitful and multiply and
[38:30] here we are you alone can bless the womb
[38:33] of my wife
[38:36] and then the Lord opened the womb of
[38:39] Rebecca
[38:40] you may be having a challenge of the
[38:43] finances
[38:44] you you don't have means to handle the
[38:47] challenges you have at home
[38:50] bring it to the Lord in prayer and seek
[38:53] the will of God
[38:55] lord what will I do you said you would
[38:58] Bless The Works of my heart and this is
[39:01] what I'm doing Lord can you bless the
[39:04] work of my heart may you multiply the
[39:06] increase
[39:08] praise the name of our Lord and then you
[39:10] find that issues
[39:12] like there was a widow whose husband was
[39:16] one of the prophets and then they were
[39:19] taking the sons into bondage
[39:22] because they were demanding a lot of
[39:24] money
[39:25] and then that woman went and cried to
[39:28] the prophet and he cried the Prophet
[39:30] Elijah
[39:32] your servant this one of the son of the
[39:36] Prophet when he died
[39:50] let's find out foreign
[40:42] what do you do do you run away from your
[40:45] home
[40:46] now if you have built a house there will
[40:49] you say it and don't buy another one
[40:52] what are you going to do praise the name
[40:55] of our Lord bring it to the Lord
[40:58] and then if it is
[41:01] you need to show them the love of God
[41:06] not to react the way they react to you
[41:09] but then you see how you show them the
[41:12] love of God you express them the love of
[41:15] God
[41:16] waiting on the Lord
[41:19] you know the Bible tells us when we got
[41:23] Philippians chapter 4
[41:26] praise the name of our Lord
[41:28] Philippians chapter four Filipina and
[41:32] then we start reading from verse 4.
[41:35] the Bible says rejoice in the
[41:39] end and again as
[41:43] soon
[41:45] let your moderation be known unto all
[41:48] men the Lord is at hand because
[41:54] be careful for nothing but in everything
[41:58] by prayer and supplication with
[42:01] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[42:04] known unto the Lord
[42:14] the Bible says be careful for nothing
[42:18] so whatever issue you have
[42:21] whatever challenge
[42:25] together
[42:47] remember in the midst of your business
[42:49] schedule
[42:50] plan to pray together
[42:56] plan to fast together
[42:59] praise the name of our Lord but you see
[43:01] what the devil has done you find that
[43:03] the husband is busy the wife is busy and
[43:07] everybody has their programs and the
[43:09] programs are not compatible
[43:11] oh now like this now all the children
[43:15] are still coming back oh now I'm busy
[43:18] marking scripts
[43:23] it's almost raining then ah you know I
[43:27] need to buy some stuff and put in the
[43:29] store I'm aiming at getting more profit
[43:32] at this time
[43:35] and then the devil keeps on taking a
[43:37] hold of the family
[43:39] he puts the differences there
[43:42] praise the name of our Lord and then you
[43:44] find that there is no peace at home
[43:49] everybody may be suspicious
[43:51] everybody is busy
[43:54] but then the Bible is
[43:57] you know let us be careful for nothing
[44:01] but let us bring every request ago let
[44:07] us be made them known to the Lord
[44:10] and you know as a family he said we are
[44:13] two or three are gathered in my name
[44:18] and as a husband
[44:20] what a great opportunity for the Lord to
[44:24] come in your immediately if you can
[44:26] gather in his name
[44:42] it's a great opportunity as a family to
[44:47] pray together as a family to present
[44:50] your request to God together
[44:52] as a family to fast together and say
[44:56] Lord this is the issue that we have no
[44:59] this is the problem
[45:01] [Music]
[45:02] we need to learn how to present all our
[45:05] issues
[45:07] and say Lord we are overwhelmed with
[45:10] this circumstance
[45:18] [Applause]
[45:25] that trouble that you have
[45:29] about praise the name of our Lord allow
[45:31] the Lord to take over it because I'm
[45:33] saying and say Lord take over this issue
[45:36] whatever challenge
[45:39] praise the name of our Lord and then now
[45:42] here there is in this message question
[45:43] and answers
[45:58] something has settled over me
[46:02] that I cannot break through
[46:05] last fall
[46:12] I dreamed I was lost in white sand okay
[46:19] it was getting dark
[46:22] I couldn't find my way
[46:25] this dream has stayed with me since last
[46:28] fall
[46:31] now I'm as one groping in darkness
[46:37] my son and wife were included in my
[46:40] dreams
[46:43] now they are also in darkness
[46:46] we are in Desperate we are in
[46:50] desperation
[46:51] I believe God will show you what
[46:54] what is in our hearts now
[46:58] if we are wrong or sinning places
[47:04] we want to be right
[47:06] and then Brett brownham answers I don't
[47:09] know the lady
[47:10] but I just feel if you are here already
[47:18] praise the name of our Lord you know
[47:20] this sister dreamed that she was lost in
[47:22] white science
[47:25] and then Darkness was coming and then
[47:28] she dreamed that her son and the the his
[47:31] wife they were also involved in that
[47:33] same trouble
[47:35] and
[47:38] so many times the devil can bring an
[47:41] issue
[47:43] and then it takes away your peace
[47:46] praise the name of Allah and then your
[47:48] brother Brandon sees their conditions
[47:50] and then interprets for them and then he
[47:54] says
[47:56] here is your trouble
[47:58] you have left you have let something
[48:01] happen to you that's made you nervous
[48:03] why do
[48:06] because being in white sense represents
[48:09] Purity and righteousness
[48:13] and you are just letting Satan
[48:16] put one over on you
[48:20] show you your your dream proved that
[48:23] there is nothing wrong
[48:26] you are only navias
[48:28] and by doing this and thinking this you
[48:33] are making the rest of your family
[48:35] navias
[48:38] stop doing it claim your god-given right
[48:44] your dream proves by the interpretation
[48:47] that you are in white sun
[48:50] everything is all right it's you
[48:53] yourself
[48:55] and you let one member your family get
[48:58] nervous
[49:00] it goes to the next member and the next
[49:04] man and the first thing you are all
[49:06] fussing and going on
[49:08] where are you and one member of the
[49:11] family gets this kind of upset
[49:13] [Music]
[49:17] about something it upsets the others
[49:24] the first thing you know whole family is
[49:27] upset
[49:29] it is
[49:31] then if one member of the family
[49:33] rejoices
[49:35] let the rest of them Rejoice with him
[49:40] so every one of them family tried to do
[49:43] that
[49:45] try each one of your children
[49:47] to help your papa
[49:52] try to help Papa and Mama try to help
[49:54] your children
[49:56] don't let that gloomy unbelieving Spirit
[50:00] get around you
[50:04] you are Christians you are born of the
[50:08] spirit you are the salt of the earth
[50:11] you have God given right
[50:14] and the Bible says if there be any
[50:18] praise
[50:24] don't think about the wrong thing
[50:29] and you see the devil just knows how to
[50:32] get a hold of our stations
[50:36] you know he can come and bring some
[50:38] thought which is not right and then you
[50:41] go with that imagination
[50:43] and something you find that your peace
[50:46] has been taken you find that your
[50:48] Liberties
[50:50] like now this family foreign
[51:45] to think about something wrong like I
[51:49] remember it was Wednesday
[51:59] a big hump
[52:02] ing up and then now there is a man who
[52:04] came behind and it was night somebody
[52:06] came and parked behind just a short
[52:08] distance from where we had passed
[52:12] and now when I was starting
[52:15] was going back and then there was a man
[52:18] passing on the side and then he said hey
[52:26] you extended behind
[52:27] then I started saying this man has
[52:31] something wrong seriously
[52:33] why would you rejoicing somebody getting
[52:35] a problem
[52:37] why would you rejoice in something doing
[52:40] something wrong
[52:42] but sometimes this is what the devil
[52:44] puts upon us
[52:45] you start rejoicing over your neighbor
[52:48] maybe for their friends
[52:52] I think that was good and then it
[52:55] becomes once into his husband and wife
[52:58] rejoicing over the others failure
[53:04] husband is happy because the wife has
[53:07] been demoted
[53:15] why would you rejoice over such a thing
[53:21] or even maybe the husband
[53:23] rejoicing when the wife gets an accident
[53:27] accident now all those mention which
[53:29] brag about are going to stop
[53:34] why would you
[53:35] read something that right
[53:39] and so you see we need not rejoicing
[53:43] things that are wrong
[53:47] but see the Bible is telling us when we
[53:50] got Philippians chapter four
[53:53] and then we read in verse 7.
[53:56] and the peace of God
[53:59] which passes all understandings
[54:07] through Christ Jesus we remember Christ
[54:09] yes sir prayer is the name of God you
[54:12] know our Lord told us my peace I give
[54:15] you
[54:16] not as the world
[54:18] but my peace I give you and the inner
[54:22] person without peace
[54:24] they are always proud of the people
[54:28] suspicious
[54:31] because they don't have peace
[54:35] when we present our request unto the
[54:38] Lord
[54:39] when we present our challenges
[54:44] Lord we have this issue
[54:48] then the peace of God
[54:54] will come down
[54:57] supposing saying God Sarah was patient
[55:00] with Abraham
[55:03] and not tell Abraham no you go with this
[55:05] man yeah
[55:07] because even Rebecca had they made
[55:10] but he didn't tell either go with my
[55:14] mind
[55:15] praise the name of us so then you find
[55:18] that there are solutions we seek foreign
[55:32] and then the Bible says
[55:36] finally Brethren
[55:38] whatsoever things are true
[55:41] whatsoever thinks are honest
[55:44] whatsoever things are just
[55:47] whatever things are pure
[55:50] whatsoever things are lovely
[55:53] whatever thinks of good report
[55:55] everything if they have been in a virtue
[55:59] and if they are be any praise
[56:03] think on this thing
[56:07] in your challenges
[56:10] think about the goodness
[56:12] talk about the goodness talk about what
[56:16] the Lord has done
[56:17] and tell the Lord what you desire
[56:20] you know what I believe that I believe
[56:24] you are going to trust me I believe
[56:26] you're going to take us through this
[56:27] because I believe you're going to do
[56:29] this
[56:30] think about good things talk about good
[56:34] things foreign
[57:16] when you stay in that kind of place
[57:22] think positive
[57:25] praise the name of our Lord think about
[57:27] the goodness of the Lord think about you
[57:30] know the things that will bring the name
[57:32] of the Lord to be exalted
[57:35] praise the name and now as a husband
[57:39] you need to love one another
[57:45] regardless of your differences
[58:42] praise the name of our Lord the same
[58:44] thing with the word
[58:55] but then you see that there are some
[58:58] scenarios
[58:59] where the husband is suspicious of the
[59:02] wife
[59:04] and their wife is suspicious of the
[59:07] house
[59:09] and you can never have peace in that
[59:11] kind of environment
[59:13] so then you need to sit down and talk
[59:16] over it
[59:17] what are your fears
[59:20] praise the name of us
[59:27] not putting spies against one another
[59:32] praise the name of Allah you know there
[59:35] are some homes if the husband is not
[59:37] around
[59:39] he makes you he gets his relative from
[59:41] the village
[59:57] husband works far away
[59:59] I have my young what maybe they can help
[1:00:02] you there yeah
[1:00:17] and to make it worse some of them go to
[1:00:21] telephone companies to get the print out
[1:00:22] of the phones
[1:00:26] check who do you communicate
[1:00:39] but one is not confident over another
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:00:45] crazy
[1:00:46] you know you need to learn how to be
[1:00:49] supportive of each other
[1:00:51] and then you need to see that your heart
[1:00:54] are open with one another
[1:00:57] not hiding this not hiding this praise
[1:01:01] the name but supportive of one another
[1:01:05] praise the name of us now let us go to
[1:01:09] First Peter chapter three
[1:01:16] foreign
[1:01:23] the scripture says likewise the husbands
[1:01:26] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:01:29] giving honor unto the wife as unto the
[1:01:33] weaker vessel and as being heard
[1:01:35] together of the grace of life that your
[1:01:37] prayers be not hindered
[1:01:40] um
[1:01:52] then he says finally be ye all of One
[1:01:56] mind having compassion one over another
[1:02:00] love as Brethren be pitfull be courteous
[1:02:15] not rendering evil for evil or railing
[1:02:19] for writing but controller wise blessing
[1:02:22] knowing that you are there and to call
[1:02:25] that you should inherit a blessing women
[1:02:42] for he that will love life and see good
[1:02:46] days let him refrain his stand from Evil
[1:02:48] and his lips that they speak no guy
[1:02:52] is
[1:03:03] let him rescue evil and do good let him
[1:03:07] seek peace and stew it
[1:03:15] praise the name of Allah and then he
[1:03:18] continues to say
[1:03:20] for the eyes of the Lord are upon the
[1:03:23] righteous and these ears are open unto
[1:03:27] their prayers but the face of the Lord
[1:03:29] is against them that do evil away
[1:03:44] amen amen now the Bible is telling us
[1:03:50] love one another don't render evil for
[1:03:54] evil
[1:03:55] because he has done me this I'm also
[1:03:58] going to do this you're not solving
[1:04:01] anything you are instead magnifying the
[1:04:04] problem
[1:04:05] but if he has done this if she has done
[1:04:08] this forgive her tell them about maybe
[1:04:12] the thing you did hurt me and then you
[1:04:14] pray for one another
[1:04:16] praise the name of Allah and then the
[1:04:19] Bible says it's too evil
[1:04:22] you know you ask you it you hate it and
[1:04:28] then you see that you seek to do good
[1:04:31] praise the name of Allah at least you
[1:04:34] should not be responsible for the
[1:04:36] challenge at home
[1:04:38] but if you are it is coming out of you
[1:04:41] then say please forgive me I didn't know
[1:04:45] that this was what it was going to do
[1:04:52] please forgive me confess to one another
[1:04:56] please this is my weakness stand with me
[1:05:01] and then the Bible says seek peace
[1:05:05] and when you seek the peace
[1:05:10] foreign
[1:05:58] foreign
[1:06:29] then Joseph her husband being a just man
[1:06:34] was not willing to make her a public
[1:06:37] example was minded to put her away
[1:06:40] privately
[1:06:49] but while he thought on these things
[1:06:53] behold the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:06:55] down to him in a dream saying Joseph the
[1:06:59] son of David fear not to take unto thee
[1:07:02] Mary thy wife for that which is
[1:07:04] conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:07:09] ghosts
[1:07:20] now Joseph he didn't know what was
[1:07:23] happening but then he says Mary's
[1:07:26] stomach is growing big
[1:07:30] and he was wondering
[1:07:32] foreign
[1:07:42] but then the Bible says Joseph never
[1:07:47] wanted to make Mary a public example
[1:07:51] my jersey looked like Mary had betrayed
[1:07:55] him
[1:07:57] but he because he loved the house he
[1:08:01] sought her protection
[1:08:04] and that should be the same thing we
[1:08:06] should have with our husband or wife
[1:08:11] what Grace are you giving them
[1:08:14] what support are you giving them
[1:08:18] crucify him
[1:08:21] maybe in the neighborhood among the
[1:08:24] relatives in the village a place
[1:08:36] Joseph never wanted to marry to go
[1:08:40] through such a kind of thing
[1:08:42] so he determined to put her away
[1:08:44] privately
[1:08:47] silence and then you will see some
[1:08:51] people when they have a difference
[1:08:53] everybody they want everybody to know
[1:08:55] about that difference
[1:08:57] that should not be so as a home
[1:09:01] keep the respect and the the kind of
[1:09:04] hone of your home
[1:09:08] because if you now come and start
[1:09:10] speaking out things you do at your home
[1:09:13] you are shaming yourself
[1:10:01] [Applause]
[1:10:13] then you have confidence before God
[1:10:16] foreign
[1:11:07] he says
[1:11:11] okay one was asking him a question
[1:11:16] how am I supposed to show my wife that I
[1:11:18] really care for her
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:23] and oh stay with the word
[1:11:28] then he says and then she said why don't
[1:11:31] you practice what you preach or believe
[1:11:36] then he jumps I'm jumping here then he
[1:11:39] says paragraph 116.
[1:11:42] he said now
[1:11:44] stay in love with her
[1:11:47] and let her see Jesus in you
[1:11:51] praise the name of us and that's what we
[1:11:54] are responsible for
[1:11:56] let your husband see Jesus
[1:11:59] regardless of his failures regardless of
[1:12:02] his mistake Let Your Children See Jesus
[1:12:06] and you know that will give you strength
[1:12:09] When you pray to God when you are
[1:12:12] claiming them
[1:12:15] Lord didn't live on my wife Lord deliver
[1:12:18] my children
[1:12:21] because the Bible has told us that the
[1:12:24] Lord is the Lord he has the prayers of
[1:12:27] those that are righteous
[1:12:29] so you have the confidence that when you
[1:12:33] pray the Lord is hearing praise the name
[1:12:36] of us so he says Let Them See Jesus
[1:12:41] and then he said I give a little
[1:12:44] illustration this morning
[1:12:46] about a person one time this little
[1:12:50] woman had received the Holy Ghost she
[1:12:54] was a very strictly person really
[1:13:01] she had a hard life
[1:13:04] and her husband was alcoholic
[1:13:08] so she kept on um
[1:13:15] you want to go to church
[1:13:19] but now everything
[1:13:21] he went down to the salon
[1:13:24] down you know in certain called city
[1:13:27] called Old Brown Derby
[1:13:29] so they hang out there with all the time
[1:13:35] then he says
[1:13:38] so hanging around there the first thing
[1:13:41] you know one time one night came up a
[1:13:44] question
[1:13:45] about church and Christians
[1:13:48] one of the old drunks
[1:13:52] setting they are saying there ain't no
[1:13:56] such a thing as a Christian
[1:13:58] and there is no such a thing
[1:14:01] oh this bunch of Hypocrites
[1:14:04] said you see them out there smoking
[1:14:08] doing the same thing that we do
[1:14:12] call themselves Christians there is no
[1:14:15] such a thing then this one drank
[1:14:22] this this man who was the husband that
[1:14:25] sister was born again
[1:14:28] raised up and said just a minute there
[1:14:32] is
[1:14:35] it
[1:14:36] it is my wife
[1:14:40] now you can imagine close up
[1:14:51] he was watching it all the time
[1:14:55] I think we can jump there and so now
[1:14:59] these people are great people are right
[1:15:02] that let us go home and pretend that we
[1:15:06] are too drunk
[1:15:08] so this husband goes with other
[1:15:10] drunkards
[1:15:11] and then they come and they do funny
[1:15:14] things
[1:15:17] to prove whether this woman is a
[1:15:18] Christian
[1:15:20] she does this they throw it away
[1:15:27] she never lost her peace of mind
[1:15:32] she was able to bear with it and then in
[1:15:35] paragraph 120.
[1:15:37] It's a whole nonsense you know that I
[1:15:41] didn't want them that way in the first
[1:15:42] place
[1:15:47] they went out there but I'm sat down and
[1:15:50] act like they was driving
[1:15:52] they had her there
[1:16:01] singing real love voice
[1:16:04] but Jesus bear the cross alone yes
[1:16:10] she was going through a trial
[1:16:15] maybe it could be your trial
[1:16:19] are you going to give up are you going
[1:16:22] to say no no no I'm no longer handling
[1:16:23] this or you are going to go through the
[1:16:26] way of the Lord this despised
[1:16:32] then he says one drunk looked at the
[1:16:35] other one
[1:16:36] she's a Christian because
[1:17:26] and then live the life of Jesus Christ
[1:17:29] foreign
[1:17:55] [Music]
[1:18:45] foreign foreign
[1:19:19] and I want to read from verse
[1:19:24] 10.
[1:19:26] the Bible says and the people ask him
[1:19:30] saying what shall we do then
[1:19:35] [Music]
[1:20:32] what shall we do
[1:20:42] and big content with your wages
[1:21:46] and see that you all reserve the peace
[1:21:48] is
[1:22:16] thanking the lord
[1:22:19] thanking the Lord for your husband
[1:22:21] thanking the Lord for your wife thanking
[1:22:24] the Lord for your children thanking the
[1:22:26] Lord for all that he has done thanking
[1:22:28] God for your home thanking God for your
[1:22:31] place
[1:22:38] and then you will see these challenges
[1:22:41] keep on disappearing one by one
[1:22:43] you thought this was a big issue God
[1:22:46] moves it away
[1:22:52] we just need to learn how to depend upon
[1:22:55] the Lord
[1:22:58] may God bless you amen
[1:23:02] I mean
[1:23:08] there's that song that says us that they
[1:23:10] are parties for the water if we can get
[1:23:12] it
[1:23:14] and then we can pray we can stand up
[1:23:17] sing it together and then we can each of
[1:23:19] us friends
[1:23:24] praise the name of our Lord
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:45] you are alone
[1:23:51] [Music]
[1:23:59] thank you
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:18] [Applause]
[1:24:23] [Music]
[1:24:31] desires
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:44] I want you
[1:24:47] [Music]
