Take it over from where you are. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen. God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; We want to bring you greetings from the saints in Canada. Those from the the church in Edmonton. Edmonton. &gt;&gt; They certainly send their love and greetings to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we are a part of you. Amen. And we've been uh over here for two weeks now enjoying your beautiful weather. We went up to Chisoro and it was about 14° &gt;&gt; and it was it was very nice. It always seems to be a little warmer here, but we we thank God for his grace. &gt;&gt; He keeps us and gives us strength. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want I wonder if we could take our Bibles together. We certainly appreciate all the ministers that have come today. and all the singers that sang. I always enjoy your singing. &gt;&gt; And thank you for everyone in the congregation that is here this morning. If there wasn't any congregation, there wouldn't be a reason to have a service because the ministering of the word is for the perfecting of the saints. Amen. It's God gives it to you. Amen. Let's turn to the book of Romans, chapter 8. I want to speak on the revelation of sunship this morning and we're just going to read one verse there and then we're going to turn over to Hebrews. Romans 8 and verse 19. And it says, "For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. Let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11 if you would. And we'll just read verse four. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous. God testifying of his gifts, and by it he being dead yet speaketh. Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Precious heavenly father, we thank you Lord that you promised to be with us. As you said, where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am in the midst of them. But Lord, we don't want you to be unappreciated this morning, but we want you to have the preeminence. We want to give you the first place. We pray that you would guide us, Lord. Guide my thoughts, Lord Jesus. That I would speak the words that you want me to speak. And Lord, may you touch our hearing today. that we could hear with understanding. Bring the revelation of your word Lord. Blessed father we pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You could have your seats. So this the scripture says the earnest expectation of the creature all it's speaking of all of creation everything that we see in the natural from from the earth and all of nature the animals right up to these mortal bodies. is in expectation looking towards something waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. The word manifestation means the revelation, the revealing, waiting for God to finish his work. be because all of creation knows that when the sons of God have come to their full redemption that all of creation will also be redeemed. So it is in expectation looking forward to the fulfillment of God's plan right from the beginning right from the fall it has been under expectation as Adam and Eve left the garden of Eden the Lord said to Eve said thy seed shall bruise the serpent's Right from that moment, that first word of God that went forth now was speaking of redemption, speaking of a coming son, speaking of the plan of God, revealing just a small portion of God's plan in all of creation. ation began to look for that fulfillment. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we find at the beginning we find Abel and and and he by faith he offered a more excellent sacrifice. God had quickened something to him. God had revealed something to him. It had become a reality. As he was searching for God and he was reaching out, God came and opened something to him and by faith and he offered that sacrifice. We can go back to the book of Genesis. And we can read in chapter 4 the story of Abel. In verse one, it says, "Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bear Cain and said, I've gotten a man from the Lord." And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of the sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. And in the process of time, it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering. But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell. So, so here now is Cain and Abel. And brother Brandham says in questions and answers, he says, "If you notice, it's always been twins all along. There was Cain and Abel were twins. And Esau and Jacob were twins. And and Jesus and Judas come out of the same tribe and in the same church. Even the Holy Spirit and the Antichrist is to be twins. so close that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible. So here was Cain and Abel that now came forth and and Jesus tells us a parable. He said the ser went out to sew and he sowed good seed but an enemy came along and sowed tears. and and and the angel said, "Shall we re shall we pull up the tears?" But the Lord said, "No, let them grow together until the end time, and then the tears will be gathered and burned, and the wheat will be gathered into my garden. So he allows them to grow together, but but even though there's no word written about them, no Bible they could point to and say, "This is me and that's you. Yet that seed can only manifest its kind. And when the seed comes to its maturity and begins to bear its fruit, then we can see what it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they did not have the Bible back in Cain and Abel's day. That's right. They didn't grow up reading that Cain was of that wicked one. He had not yet manifested his fruit. There was no book of genealogies that said Abel was the son of Adam who was the son of God. But these were just two twins that were growing up together. And the Bible says in the process of time, they both came to bring an offering to God. They both felt assured that God would speak to them or whether or not they were assured, they had a desire that God would speak to them. They came to God for their different reasons. Cain came for for whatever his reason was. whatever he wanted from God. Abel came by revelation in the process of time. The Bible says by faith Abel offered the sacrifice. Faith doesn't come from nowhere. Faith comes from hearing the word. hearing the word of God. So Abel had been feeding on something. Abel had had been listening. Abel had been desiring and and and and here now these these boys were born and they begin to grow and and and they become young boys, not babies anymore. And they begin to look up to Adam as all sons do. Say, "Oh, there's my daddy. I want to be just like him. I want to be strong like him. I want to be handsome like him. I want to be smart like him. They're just boys with desires in their heart. And and as Adam and Eve would put them down to bed at night, they would probably say, "Daddy, tell us stories. We we we want you to tell us stories." Well, what kind of stories do you want to hear? Tell us what it was like in the Garden of Eden. I I hear you say to mom that it was different before. I hear you say to mom, "If only we could go back." What are you talking about? What do you want to go back to? Tell us about that place. You know, Adam would begin to tell them stories about how that God created the heavens and the earth. And God brought forth all the fish in the sea. And he brought forth all the birds in the air. And he brought forth all of the animals on the land. And and oh, he all of the the trees and and the flowers. And Adam would say there was a place where we used to live where God took every tree that was good for food, every tree that was pleasant to the eyes and he put them in one place that was called the garden of Eden. It was a paradise made by God. And he made it just for us so that we could enjoy it. So that we could live in this perfect place. It was so beautiful. It was such a wonderful place. And there as as God uh created me and put me in this garden, all of these animals that you see around us He began to bring them to me. And you you see that that sheep over there? He says, "Do you know why it was called a sheep?" Well, I don't know. The boys would say, "God must have called it that. No, God brought it to me." And and and God said, "What is that?" And I said, "That's a sheep. And God said, "That's a sheep." You see the the lion up there on the hill. And and you know why that's called a lion? Why is it called a lion? Because God brought that great cat to me. Said, "Adam, what is this?" I said, "That's a lion." God said, "That's a lion." My God did all of these things. How he loved us. How he created such a perfect world. The power of God was in that place. The power of the spoken word. My one time we were just resting there by the grass just enjoying the sunshine. The sun began to go down and it went behind the great the great pine tree and and it got a little bit of shade on us. And your mother said, "Adam, it's a little chilly." I said, "Tree, move over here. You're in the way. You're not in the right place." And it had to listen. It had to obey my voice. &gt;&gt; Oh, it was a wonderful place. Oh, he Adam would say, "Remember the other day as as we were out with the flock of sheep and and out came a lion from the bush and and it and it it it snuck up and we didn't see it coming." And my it it came and it pounced on that lamb. And before we could rescue it, it had killed that lamb, tore it apart. And all the sheep were scattered in fear, trying to find safety. And we were running trying to beat the lion. And how it took that lamb and destroyed it and ate it. ate it, ate the lamb, &gt;&gt; re remember how how terrifying that was. Remember how big that lion was? Oh, I hope he doesn't come back again. Yeah. Adam would say, "But back in the garden, what about the garden?" Back in the garden, there was lions. Oh, there was lions there. Just as big as they are now. Yeah, ju just as big as they are now. Well, how did you protect the sheep? Oh, we didn't have to protect the sheep. That lion and the lamb were best of friends. They would feed together. They would go down to the stream and drink together. And when that lion would lay down to sleep, The lamb would just lay down by the light. There was no fear there. There was no death there. There was perfect joy there. There was perfect love. There was perfection. Nothing could die. None could hurt nor destroy. Oh is such a wonderful place. Oh, maybe maybe as the boys were growing and and and they'd been listening to these stories and and they're growing in maturity, their minds are beginning to think, maybe they would say, "Dad, if there was just one thing that you could have from that garden, if there was just one thing you could have back, What would you have back from that place? You talked about how your body was perfect back then. Would you take that perfect body? You talked about the lion and the lamb. Would it be to see them laid together once again? You talked about the power to move the trees. Would you would you want the power to move those trees again? If there was one thing that you could have back, what would you desire to have? Oh, Adam would say, if there was one thing, if there was only one thing there, there is one thing that I would love more than anything. Oh, they would say, what is it? What's your desire? Oh, he would say every day as the sun would begin to go down the cool of the evening, there would come a presence into the garden and I would turn to your mother. She would turn to me. I would say, "He's here. Do you feel that presence? He's here. He's come back again just as he said he would. It's the cool of the day once again. He's come down to fellowship with us. He's come down to express to us his love. He's come down to reveal himself to us. He's come down to share with us his word. Oh, how we would run to the feet of our heavenly father. I would love to sit in that presence. I would love to hear his voice. If there was one thing that I could have back, it's just the joy of sitting in his presence. the joy of fellowship with &gt;&gt; when when he would call out in the cool of the evening, Adam, my son, where are you? Oh, we would come running, father, I'm here. I'm here, father. Oh, and he we would come to him. He would come to us and we would just sit and enjoy the meal of the evening. &gt;&gt; If there's one thing that I could go back to, I just want to be back in fellowship with Oh, they would say, "Why can't we go back? It sounds so wonderful. Why can't we hear his voice? Why can't we feel his presence? Oh, Adam would hang his head. So, one day there was sin that came into our lives. God said we could eat of all of the trees, but of that one tree we couldn't partake of. And then and one day there was a serpent. He was more subtle than every other beast. Oh, they would say that serpent. That one, how could he be more subtle? He hate him. He despised him. Oh, he wasn't always like that. God cursed him. God took his legs off of him, put him on his belly, told him he would have to go on his belly all the days of his life. But there was one time that he was more subtle than any beast in the earth. He was more subtle than that lion creeping up on the sheep. He was just like a man. do. &gt;&gt; And there one day he got anointed by the devil and he and he got your mother aside when we were separated from each other. Then he said, "Hath God said, oh yes, Eve said, we can eat of all of the trees, but not this tree." And and and that that that serpent beg your mother, causing her to eat of that tree. And she came back to me and I could tell something was different. I could tell something was wrong. Eve, what's going on? Oh, Adam, she said, "Come partake of this tree. It makes you wise. It makes you know good from evil." And all all I could think about was what God had said. Oh, and how wrong she had done. She had fallen into sin. But I haven't told you about how I met your mother. As every creature passed by, there was no creature that struck within my heart. every creature there was male and female. Even when that serpent came by, there was male and female, but there was nothing that spoke to me. And one day I fell into a deep sleep. God took a rib out of me and separated my spirit and put part of it in in that body and he breathed life into her and and he brought her to me and he woke me up and and he said, "Adam, what do you think of this woman?" And oh, there was something that spoke to me. I said this is flesh of my flesh. This is bone of my bone. Oh, when you find that one, you'll leave father and mother and cleave only to your wife. There's something about that connection that goes beyond the natural. And and when she fell into sin, all I could think about was losing her. All I could think about was being separated from. And even though I knew it was wrong, I had to partake. If she was going to die, I had to die with her. It was a reflection of God. as a reflection of the work of Christ that he would die for his bride. And Adam who was a son of God couldn't help but be a reflection of his heavenly father. And there we had partaken and we knew that we were naked and we began to make clothes for ourselves. Oh, we worked hard on those clothes. We worked hard making those clothes. We knew God was coming and and and and we were naked. And and we we had to cover ourselves. There was something inside of us. We need to cover ourselves. And so we worked hard. We did the best that we could. We only had hours before the end of the day. And we made the best clothes that we could make. But when his presence came down, we hid in the bushes. We said there there's no way we can come before God. fig leaves or no fig leaves, works or no works, we're not worthy to stand in his presence. We hid ourselves from him, Adam, where are you? But there was something within us that couldn't resist that call. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. It didn't matter how far from God's you were. There was something inside of you that could not resist his voice. You felt unworthy to be in his presence. You felt unworthy to even step in the doors of this world. But you couldn't resist it. There was a deep calling to the Lord. God was calling your name. Adam, where are you? No. Adam said, I couldn't resist that call. We came before God. Our hands hanging down, ashamed. God said, "Wait. I I I hear you coming." God knew what they had done. Brother Brandham says he he took two lambs and he and he and he he skinned them and and he took those skins and threw them in the bushes. Said, "Put these on and come before me. I can't stand to see you in that condition." Oh, we we knew that we were as good as dead. But God rich in mercy. God rich in his love. Oh, he never changed. He loved us from the beginning. And even when we were sinners, he slew a lamb in our place. covered our sins out of the lamb and we could come out and stand before God. But that that those lamb skkins though they could cover our sin. They couldn't take away our sins. And God said, "You cannot live in this garden anymore. You cannot stand in my presence. You must go out from the garden. There the angels took us out of the garden. And God has placed those cherubims to guard the entrance to the garden. That's why we can't go back there anymore. But in the process of time, &gt;&gt; there was another son of God, a boy by the name of Abel that begin to come to his maturity. That seed within him was being manifested. Says something within him is burning. There must be a way back into fellowship. There must be a way to come into the presence of God. There must be a way that I can have that fellowship. Oh, &gt;&gt; that's what burns in the heart of every son and daughter of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You come to him. You receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but you're not yet satisfied. There must be more. There must be a way back. This natural world doesn't satisfy what is inside of me. It's a hunger for more. All down through the ages, the sons of God have looked for the promise to be. Adam looked for a city whose builder and maker was God. He had heard God's voice. He had obeyed God's voice. He went to a land that God would show him. That didn't satisfy He looked for a city whose builder and maker was God. We're always in a hurry. But the Bible says in the process of time, at its appointed time, in God's appointed season, he fulfills his word. Brother Brandham says, he says, "Now when the brethren received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, they said, "This is the summit. This is all of it." But brethren, that's wrong. There is no summit to God's power. We move on and on and on. It's the unlimited resources of God. It's never been tapped yet. Blessings and powers that we know nothing about. When was he speaking about this? This is 1955. The seals of night have been opened. The revelation of Jesus Christ. He says there's more. There's blessings and powers we don't know anything about. It's never been revealed to archangels. He says it's laying just ahead for it is his church that will believe for eye has not seen and ear has not heard neither has entered into the hearts of man what God has in store for them that are brother Brandham says So, let's move up and claim our rights. As God opens the gates and swings out the welcome mat, let's move on up into deeper depths and never colonize ourselves. Never organize ourselves to get to a place where we believe this and that's all. But let's believe this. Plus, how much more we can hear from God. Amen. He didn't know what was coming. He didn't know what God was doing with his ministry. He didn't know there was going to be a sounding of the seventh angel. But he knew there was something lying just ahead for the church. And he says, "As God opens the doors, let's move in. As God invites us in, let's come in. Don't be afraid of the word of God. If God makes it real to you, you claim it and move on in. Footsteps is possession. When they went into the promised land, God said, "I will drive the enemies out before you." But they had to take footsteps. They had to lay claim to it. Every obstacle they came up to, God was there to see them through it. And God is bringing you to the possession of your inheritance. In every step of the way, he is going to be there to guide you through it. So when he lights up a promise in his word, just stand on it and claim it as yours. Don't listen to what the devil says. Don't listen to the circumstances around you. But just hold to God's word by the faith that he has placed within you and watch him bring his promise to pass. Amen. A maturity must come. The revelation of the sons of God must come. It must be revealed what we are and who we are. And that's what he's coming this day to do. You just have to believe it. That's all that's left for you to do is to believe it. That's right. &gt;&gt; As many as are led by the spirit of God. They are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; You've not received the spirit of bondage again to fear. But you've received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Aba, Father. Adoption is the finished work. &gt;&gt; Adoption is where the son has the same authority as the father. He's saying the spirit of God is going to bring you to completion. He's going to finish the work. How do we know that we're children of God? Not because our mom says we're a child of God. Not because our dad says we're a child of God. Not because the pastor says we're a child of God. But the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. And if children then heirs, heirs of God. joint hes with Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; As many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if his spirit is within you, then you can't help but manifest a son of God. Just like your children, they have the spirit of a human within them. They can't help but manifest who they are to be. When you have a baby, you don't have to worry. Say, "Is this one going to be a pig? Is this one going to be a dog? I wonder if this one will become a chicken. But no, you're not worried because the spirit within it must manifest itself. The life that is within it must come to its maturity. And you know that when it comes to maturity, it's going to be just like you. Those little boys and girls, they sit at your table, they look up to you, They say, "Oh, I want to be just like daddy, or I want to be just like mommy." There's a spirit within them that's bearing record. That's saying, "Aba, father. I've got to become that. That's my ambition in life." It doesn't do no good for a dog to have that ambition because it'll never be a human. Doesn't do no good for for a pig to have that ambition because it'll never become a human. But your children should have that ambition. Because it's it's their predestination to become a human. They were born to be a human and they've got to become a human. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; They listen to your stories. They listen to you. Maybe those of you that drive the bordas and they hear about about how fast you got home. And the close calls that you had, this one just about hit me. Oh, and I had to go around this big hole. I didn't see it, but I got around just in time. And they're just looking with their eyes. Oh, daddy. I want to drive a boat. &gt;&gt; I want to do that. I want to drive your car. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you you just laugh. Say, "Ah, just eat your food, son." &gt;&gt; And the boy might sit there and pout. Daddy doesn't love me. He won't let me drive his car. He won't let me drive his motorbike. But it's not because the father doesn't love him. The father knows that he's going to come to a place where he can do it. If he if he just eats his food, if he eats his food and does his lessons, He's going to come to a place where he can do what the father does. Amen. So he's not laughing because he's making fun of him, but he laughs because he's proud of him. He hears him crying, "Aba, father." And he says, "That's my boy. That's my son." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have two brother-in-laws, uh, two brothers of my wife &gt;&gt; and they're twins &gt;&gt; and they grew up on a farm and they had a a farm truck and and their father, he did a lot of work out of town. And one day he was out of town and and the neighbor came over and said to their mother said, "Oh, I I I see that your husband's come home." No. She said, "My husband's not home. He's still out working." Oh, they said, "We saw the farm truck going down the road the other day." And if and and come to find out that these two boys, they were about 8 years old, but they wanted to be just like their daddy. And one of them was standing up on the seat. holding the steering wheel and the gas and the other boy was on the floor and he's pushing the clutch and the gas pedal. They were in a lot of trouble when their daddy came home. &gt;&gt; Because they weren't mature enough to be driving that truck. There was coming a time when they would be able to do it. But now was not the time. The Bible says, "Despise not the chastening of the Lord. nor faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loveth, he chases, brings the correction, teaches them, instructs them because he loves them and he wants you to come to maturity. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; The father knows what the children need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8 verse 26. Amen. says, "Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." Amen. He that searchth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you are born again, you now come into the will of God. God has a will for your life. God has a purpose for you. It's his desire that you would be just like him. That's why he gives you his spirit that cries abba father. So his spirit is making intercession according to his will. Amen. We say Lord I need this. Lord I need that. I need more money. I need a bigger house. I I need a better job. The spirit of God makes intercession for us not according to what we wanted but according to the will of God. Job went through his trial. Many times we go through trials like Job where we feel forsaken and we feel like we're on our sick bed and God is not hearing our prayer. But God had a will for Job. God had a revelation he was bringing to Job. And he's doing the same in your life. He's got more revelation to bring. He's got more faith to bring. So just hold to God's unchanging hand. He's making intercession for you according to the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, who are the called according to his purpose. Verse 28. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. So he didn't predestinate you to some position in this world in Satan's kingdoms. Though he might put you in certain positions in order to mold you in a certain way, he might give you certain things in this world. In order to mold you in a certain way, but his purpose and design is that you would be conformed to the image of his son. that Jesus Christ would be the firstborn among many brethren. So within the hearts of the sons and daughters of God, there is a desire to be in fellowship with God. That's right. There's something within you. There's a deep calling to the deep. And there's a deep that must respond as God calls your name. He's not finished after giving you the new birth. That's why you're still hungry. That's why you come for more. Because there's more to be had. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. And &gt;&gt; there we find Abel, &gt;&gt; that desire burning within his heart, &gt;&gt; wanting to bring an offering that would bring God down. Amen. &gt;&gt; And by faith, he brought that lamb. He didn't figure it out. Faith doesn't come by figuring it out. But blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness. For they shall be filled. Here he was hungering for God. And God begin to reveal himself to him. There was a lamb for my mother. I remember the story God coming down and throwing them those lamb skkins. There was a lamb for mother. There was a lamb for father. Surely there could be a lamb for me. something begin to answer back like brother Brandham speaks of brother Brandham says when it begins to come it's like 2 + 2 equals 4 2 + 2 = 4 2 + 2 = 4 and it begins to feet together and and Abel, that revelation is coming. There can be a lamb for me. Oh, I am a sinner. I'm not worthy to come before God. But but God provided a lamb for them. Lord, I can't bring you nothing of myself. I can't bring you nothing of my works. But Lord, if you receive this lamb, let it cover my sins that I can come into fellowship. There God comes down cuz that's my son. That fruit begin to manifest itself. It manifested itself in Cain in a different way because it wasn't the same seed. It manifested in him in anger and in jealousy and in hatred and he slew his brother. But in Abel, it manifested a humility, a humility to the word, an obedience to the revelation of God. And God came down and received his offering. And God orchestrates events in your life because he's bringing you to the adoption of sons. Right from the apostles time, they said hope towards the end. They said all of creation is groaning and in travail together until now. Even we ourselves which have the first fruits of the spirit. We've got the new birth. But something is still groaning within us. Amen. Waiting for the adoption. The redemption of our bodies. Says there's something within us groaning. Peter says, "Hope to the end for the grace that is to come at the revelation of Jesus Christ." John said, "Now we are the sons of God, but that does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know when we see him, we will be like him. For we shall see him as he is. And they knew that it was God's purpose to conform them to the same image. So they knew when Christ revealed all that sunship was that they would walk into the same thing &gt;&gt; because it was God's purpose. what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god. Therefore the world knows us not because it knew him not. Then he goes on first John 3 says, "Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him. We shall for we shall see him as he is. Every man that has this hope purifith himself even as he is puremen. &gt;&gt; There's a hope lying within us, a yearning. Amen. &gt;&gt; But hope that is seen is not hope anymore. When God reveals himself, just like he revealed himself to Abel, when God reveals Christ to the sons of God, now that hope can be turned to faith because now is the season. Jesus said, "At that day, you'll know that I am in the Father and that I am in you and you are in me." At that day, he said, "You'll know it." Brother Brandham said, "That day is this day. This day, this scripture is fulfilled. The days of the voice of the seventh angel when he began to sound. The mystery of God should be finished. All of those mysterious seals hiding the mystery of God. Brother Brandham says Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And now as he reveals his message, now you can take a hold of this message and trust that in this message is the grace that will bring you to adoption is the grace that will bring you to maturity. The grace that will finish the plan of God. A grace that will reveal the sons of God. That which all of creation has been groaning for. It is here. We just have to lay hold of it. We just have to walk in it as God gives us life. The seals have been open, but they've got to be open to you because it's a personal walk. Brother Brandham says, "When a man walks by perfect faith, he's shut in to a world with him and God alone, but the pastor's not in there with you. your mother and father not in their heart. But when God makes himself known to you, it's you and him alone in a secret place. In a hidden place, a place the world knows nothing about. A place where Christ reveals himself to where he opens his word personally. Brother Brandham said when those seals were open, he said the Bible became a new book to me. And you've got to let him open the seals to you. The Bible will become a new book to you cuz you'll see all that Christ was, all that Christ is. And you will see who you are because you must be conformed to that same image. Nothing lacking. Wow. Revelations chapter 5. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In John, in Revelations 4, John sees the throne of God and he describes it. And then in Revelations 5, he he looks a little deeper. says, "I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. No man was worthy. Abel wasn't worthy. &gt;&gt; Abraham wasn't worthy. &gt;&gt; The father of the faith. &gt;&gt; Jacob wasn't worthy. His name had been changed to Israel. As a prince, thou has power with God. But he wasn't worthy. None of the prophets were worthy. &gt;&gt; Moses wasn't worthy who spoke lip to ear with God, but he wasn't worthy. John the Baptist wasn't worthy. Jesus said, "There's never been a man born of a woman greater than John. Maybe you thought, "Well, this is John's moment." The greatest one born of a woman. Where's John? Come on, John. Now's your moment. Now's your time. You take the book. But John said, "I'm not worthy to even loose the sheep. lamb that is coming and no one was worthy. And there John sees redemption in the hand of him that's on the throne. And without that redemption, if no one could take the book, all would be lost. John much, because no man was found worthy to open and read the book, neither to look thereon. John is weeping. He had the Holy Ghost and and and he he he he had he had seen the power of God. But but if if that book wasn't redeemed, that which is he was groaning for could not come into manifestation. The work could not be completed. He had seen Christ standing in the midst of the church. He had seen the reward to the overcomer. That they would eat from the tree of life. That they would not be heard of the second death. That God would give them a new name. Give them power over the nations. A morning star clothed in white raignment, a pillar in the temple of God to sit with him in his throne. But all of it is lost because no one's worthy to take the book. He says, "Oh, I've seen what Christ did for us. I've seen how he died on the tree. I've seen the veil was was rent. I've seen all of these things happened. He was the lamb of God. He rose again. Oh, surely somebody would be worthy to now do this part. Where's the one that will do this part? and he's crying, "No one's worthy is lost." But then one of the elders said, "Weep not, John, because the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed. He looks to see this lion. Where's this great lion? Where's this one? Oh, let me see this mighty one. And and behold, a lamb came from within the throne as it had been slain and takes a book out of heaven. And he says, "Every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying, blessing and honor and glory and power be to him that siteth upon the throne and unto the lamb. him forever and ever. John said, "I see him there. He's the one that was on the cross. He's the one that was there. He's the one that saved us. He's the one that heals us. And his atonement has also paid for our redemption. Oh, he's paid for everything and he is worthy. Oh, and he rejoice. Now the work of God could be finished. And and now as we come to Revelations 10, when the mighty angel comes down with that open book and seven thunders utter their voices, John says, "Oh, I see it. I see the revealing. Let me write it." He said, "I was about to write." This is the message that needs to go to the church. This is what they need. This is going to bring faith for rapture. It's going to be faith to overcome all things. This is going to be faith to bring a body change. This is going to be faith to bring the resurrection of the saint. Let me bring this message to the church. But but he said, "No, John, don't write it. Seal it up." But in the days of the voice of the seven, when he begins to sound, the mystery of God will be finished as he's declared to his servants the day. I will break those seals. open that book that the church could know who she is. That sons of God could know what it means to be a son of God. They could see the completion of my plan and then they will be revealed to the world, the manifestation of the sons of God. That day is this day. Oh, let us walk in it, saints. We are come to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant. That speaks better things than that of Abel. Brother Random says, "Abel was a righteous man. He died innocent because he was in the way. He was in the way standing for the real revelation that he had. He spoke. It cried out. The justice, the just blood of Abel cried out against Cain. But the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out, it redeemed. It speaks better things. It makes you sons and daughters. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, Peter said, &gt;&gt; and be sober and hope to the end for for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children. Not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance. &gt;&gt; That capstone came down with cryings of grace. Grace. Brother Brandham says he says when he started to write those seven thunders he said don't write it he had been commissioned to write everything he seen but when those seven thunders in revelations 10 uttered he said don't write them at all they are mysteries we don't know what they are Yet this is the first seal. &gt;&gt; He said, "And when it do, it'll give faith for that rapturing grace for that church to move out." Amen. So we are sitting around the table of the Lord &gt;&gt; and he is saying just eat your food. There's something within you crying abba father &gt;&gt; and he's saying just eat what I put before you will manifest who you are. &gt;&gt; You were in my thoughts before the foundation of the world. my spirit to quicken that seed within you and it must bring forth of its kind. Just eat the food that I put before you. As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. which are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. He gave you the power to become the sons of God. It wasn't an instant transformation, but the power is within you to do it. line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. Brother Brandham says, "Now out of every kindred, tribe and nation, he he has purposed a new creation. He was the first of that creation. He was God created in the form of man. Now by his spirit, he's creating many sons unto himself. God the creator creating himself a part of his creation. This is the true revelation of God. This was his purpose. This purpose took form through election this morning today. You you might not have faith for a body change, but God is bringing you there. Bible says from faith unto faith. Today you don't need a body change. Today you need faith for the trial God has put you in today. So just walk into what God puts before you. &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing the word. If you need healing today, you aren't going to be able to work up a healing within yourself. But there's promises in the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you look to the word. &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, make this promise real in my life. Make this promise a reality to me. and you walk towards that. Come to church expecting to hear from. Lord, you know my need because you put me in this trial. You predestinated my life. You're bringing me through this walk. And if you allowed this trial to come, it must be because you have the solution. So Lord, I am coming to you under expectation that you're going to bring the solution because it's not my faith, but it's your faith. Brother Brandham said, "A believer is the faith of God that moves in us." We need God to quicken his word to us, line upon line, whatever you're facing today. Maybe maybe you have financial needs. May maybe you need deliverance, but you must walk in the word of God. saying, "Lord, this caught me by surprise. But this did not catch you by surprise. Lord, you know where the provision is. Give me the faith to walk in it." And when God drops the faith within your heart, then the all fear is gone. and and now you can walk knowing that God has provided it for you. You might not see it. You might not feel it. You might not hear it. You might not even smell it. But that doesn't matter. Because when faith is quickened, faith is the sixth sense. faith lays hold on something from beyond the veil. Faith has laid a hold of God. &gt;&gt; That nothing is impossible with God. That I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. It's not by our might. It's not by our power, &gt;&gt; but it's by my spirit, sayeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; so give him the preeminence. Let him have his way. Don't be in a hurry, but just keep feeding on God's word. And in the process of time, in its season, God will bring you to revelation. And to revelation and to revelation to revelation until one day the saints will arise. It won't catch you by surprise because you'll be walking with the Lord. You're walking in a world with you and God alone. He's teaching you. He's instructing you. He's guiding you. &gt;&gt; So let's love him. &gt;&gt; Let's love him. And let's give him praise because he is worthy. Amen. Amen. Amen. You love the Lord. Why don't we stand together? Maybe you could just sing that song. I love him. I love him because he first loved me. You know that song? Amen. Amina. &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him. Because he first love me. Did he purchase your redemption and purchase just my salary? Just sing it one more time as your pastor comes. &gt;&gt; I love you. is my salvation. Oh calary tree gone from my heart now. Gone from my heart.
