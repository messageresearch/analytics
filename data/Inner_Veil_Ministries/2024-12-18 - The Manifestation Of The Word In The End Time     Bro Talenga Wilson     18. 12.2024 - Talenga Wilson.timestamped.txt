[35:32] one amen for a title this
[35:36] evening it's the manifestation of the
[35:39] word in the end
[35:42] times amen amen so let's pick it from
[35:45] The Book of
[35:48] Genesis in the beginning God created the
[35:51] Heaven
[35:55] and and Earth was with without
[35:59] form and
[36:03] void and darkness was upon the face of
[36:07] the
[36:10] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[36:13] the face of
[36:16] the and God
[36:19] said there
[36:22] be
[36:25] there us
[36:27] Precious
[36:30] Jesus
[36:35] ice
[36:37] haveed and that I come and
[36:42] speak as
[36:44] a I
[36:47] Lord but I pray father that the
[36:51] gra that has me to speak
[36:56] tonight the
[37:04] usare us as we sail on this

[37:13] your

[37:55] most precious name
[37:58] CHR amen we get
[38:02] seated amen so now in the
[38:06] beginning the Bible says God
[38:10] created the Heaven and
[38:13] Earth and in
[38:16] verse God
[38:18] said let there
[38:20] be praise the Lord so God made a
[38:25] statement God spoke
[38:28] let there be
[38:30] light praise the Lord and like we saw
[38:32] last
[38:34] Wednesday that when God
[38:36] spoke whatever he spoke had to be in
[38:42] expression it had to come into
[38:45] manifestation so whatever was
[38:47] manifested was the
[38:50] expression of the mind of God praise God
[38:54] so when God said let there be lights
[38:57] and the Bible says and there was
[39:00] light so in the mind of God thought of
[39:05] light and he saw the light so he spoke
[39:08] the words and light came forth an
[39:13] expression of what was the mind of
[39:16] God praise the Lord so now we see that
[39:20] everything that was
[39:22] created was created by the spoken
[39:25] word praise the Lord so at the
[39:28] beginning God heard the word then he
[39:32] began to s the word into the
[39:35] world and he said let there be the earth
[39:39] and the heaven praise the Lord let there
[39:42] be
[39:43] light praise the Lord And now when we
[39:46] turn to the Book of
[39:48] Genesis ver
[39:51] 26 praise the Lord now here when God was
[39:54] creating man
[39:57] he still
[39:58] spoke the word praise the Lord he said
[40:03] let us create man in our own
[40:06] image after our likeness and let them
[40:09] have dominion over the fish of the
[40:13] sea and over the F of the
[40:17] air and over the CLE and over all the
[40:22] Earth every creeping thing that creepeth
[40:25] upon the Earth
[40:27] so God created man in his own image in
[40:32] the image of God created he
[40:35] him so we still see that verse
[40:39] 26 the first part when God was done
[40:44] creating the Heaven and the
[40:47] Earth and all the things that are
[40:49] in he said let us create
[40:53] man that was a
[40:55] statement he spoke the word he sold a
[41:00] seed praise the Lord so God sold a seed
[41:03] in the
[41:04] beginning which was the word praise the
[41:08] Lord so everything that was
[41:11] created which was created by the spoken
[41:14] word it was a seed that God
[41:18] planted and everything that he planted
[41:21] he expected a manifestation of the
[41:25] seity that's why when he said
[41:28] let there be light praise the Lord he
[41:31] planted the seed of the spoken word and
[41:34] then light came for a
[41:38] manifestation praise the lord of the
[41:41] seed that God had
[41:43] planted praise the of living God and now
[41:46] when he comes to
[41:48] man he still has man in his thoughts
[41:53] then he speaks the word he plants the
[41:56] seed
[41:57] and then he expects to see a
[42:02] manifestation of the seed that he had
[42:04] planted and when he said let us create
[42:07] man and verse 27 says so God created man
[42:13] in his own image praise the Lord so it
[42:16] first it was the spoken word then we see
[42:19] a manifestation of the spoken
[42:22] words when man is
[42:25] created praise the Lord
[42:27] so now we notice that everything that
[42:31] God
[42:32] spoke everything that God
[42:35] created he created everything
[42:39] specific when he said let there be light
[42:43] the Bible does not say and there was
[42:46] water praise the Lord so every word that
[42:49] went forth out of his
[42:51] mouth it brought forth its
[42:55] kindness prise
[42:57] if it was light it had to be light
[43:01] manifested if it was man it had to be
[43:05] man
[43:06] manifested so we see that whatever he
[43:08] planted in the
[43:11] beginning God
[43:13] expects to see the fruits to see the
[43:17] seeds that bear the same
[43:20] nature what was spoken in the
[43:24] beginning praise the Lord and just like
[43:26] we said said last
[43:28] Wednesday that we were in the mind of
[43:31] God praise the Lord and God wanted us to
[43:34] be
[43:35] manifest so he spoke the word and when
[43:38] he spoke the word came into
[43:42] existence a
[43:44] manifestation an expression of the
[43:47] thought that was in the mind of God so
[43:50] whatever was
[43:51] created it is the
[43:53] expression of the mind of God
[43:57] the Lord whatever we see praise the Lord
[44:01] the animals the
[44:04] vegetations the entire nature it is all
[44:08] an
[44:09] expression of what was in the mind of
[44:12] God before he began to say Let There be
[44:16] this praise the Lord because the Bible
[44:19] says in the
[44:22] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[44:25] Earth but you see how take us back the
[44:29] artist praise the Lord any artist when
[44:33] they want to do
[44:35] something they first of all have the
[44:37] imagination in their
[44:39] mind praise the Lord and then they begin
[44:42] to ponder about
[44:44] it and then the picture begins to
[44:48] grow and when he feels the picture is
[44:52] ready of what he wanted to be then he
[44:55] gets a pen he gets a
[44:59] boat and he begins to draw whatever he's
[45:02] putting on the board is the expression
[45:06] of the mind that he had before he got a
[45:10] to draw
[45:11] it so whatever we see on Earth you and I
[45:16] and all nature were in the mind of God
[45:20] as a before he began
[45:23] creation so now he comes and says let
[45:27] there be and it was praise the Lord when
[45:30] he says Let There be this bir it had to
[45:34] be that b because it is what was in the
[45:38] mind of God before he spoke
[45:40] it so when I say that we are the
[45:46] expression of the mind of God before the
[45:49] foundation of the world then I am right
[45:53] and now I want us to drive to
[45:55] something the
[45:57] estation of the word which God
[46:01] s in the beginning the
[46:04] manifestation the expression of the word
[46:08] which God planted as a seed in
[46:12] Genesis praise the Lord because when a
[46:15] farmer goes out to
[46:16] plant he picks a seat and he throws it
[46:20] to the
[46:21] ground and he does not throw into the
[46:23] ground to leave it there prise Lord he
[46:27] gives it time but the purpose of
[46:30] throwing this seed to the
[46:33] ground to get back the seed of the same
[46:38] kind praise the Lord so if farmer does
[46:40] not get a bean
[46:42] seed puts it to the ground and he
[46:46] expects to get jack
[46:48] fruit praise the Lord if he wants ja
[46:51] fuit he will get those fruits and then
[46:55] he burries them to the ground
[46:57] and he will be expecting
[46:59] Jack the same way God did in the
[47:04] beginning praise the Lord so now when he
[47:06] began to
[47:08] create praise the Lord he also created
[47:12] man and now when he created man he
[47:15] created him by the
[47:17] word and so he kept man in the
[47:20] garden by the word praise the Lord
[47:24] that's why where he created Adam and
[47:27] he told them you can eat of any fruit of
[47:31] the
[47:32] garden this touch not it was by the word
[47:38] praise the Lord so he expected man to
[47:42] express
[47:44] obedience to the
[47:46] word why because he created him by the
[47:49] word and the intention of God the mind
[47:53] of God was to lead man by the same word
[47:59] which was
[48:00] created why because
[48:04] man must bring
[48:07] forth praise the Lord FRS must bring
[48:13] forths that are
[48:15] like what created him so if you are
[48:19] created by the word so we we are
[48:22] expected to bring forth fruits that are
[48:26] worthy of the
[48:28] words in other words we are
[48:31] expected to express to
[48:35] manest that word by which we were
[48:38] created praise the Lord and so now God
[48:41] put them in the garden and said be there
[48:45] enjoy everything have
[48:48] dominion praise the Lord and so he kept
[48:51] them there by the
[48:53] words but now along the way
[48:57] we know Satan
[48:59] comes and when he comes he also came by
[49:03] the
[49:04] word and the Bible does not say that
[49:07] Satan
[49:09] disputed
[49:11] disputed the word which God had given to
[49:15] Adam and
[49:17] Eve no he never said that but what Satan
[49:21] did he twisted a little bit of the words
[49:27] he said it's true he said do not eat
[49:30] this but this is what he meant so now
[49:34] Satan change the interpretation of the
[49:38] word which led to the fall of Man but
[49:41] what was the intention of Satan he also
[49:45] wanted to SW his
[49:48] seed praise the Lord and remember the
[49:51] parable when God spoke about a
[49:54] farmer when Jesus spoke about
[49:58] par went out to s that when he went to S
[50:02] he saw the seeds then he went to sleep
[50:06] then the Neighbors in the night they
[50:09] came and brought wild
[50:11] seeds when the servants went in the
[50:14] morning after the C had started
[50:18] gerting they saw that there were some
[50:21] seties that we coming up that we
[50:25] different
[50:26] what their Master had
[50:28] saw so now they came and they told him
[50:32] Master we have seen some seats that are
[50:36] different from what we planted and they
[50:39] said let us go and have
[50:41] fruit and what did what did Jesus say he
[50:44] said leave them to grow
[50:47] together at the time of harvest it shall
[50:51] be a time of
[50:52] Separation praise the Lord so now when
[50:55] Satan came into the garden
[50:57] he also wanted to bring a
[51:01] seed and pl it into the
[51:04] garden praise the Lord so now God could
[51:08] not destroy it all he allowed them to
[51:12] grow and at Harvest Time that's when the
[51:17] wheat shall be gathered together then
[51:21] the tears shall be buled for burning let
[51:26] them grow together why because God has
[51:30] confidence in the seed that he has
[51:33] planted praise the Lord he's
[51:36] aware that whatever he has planted it
[51:40] must bring
[51:41] forth for youth of its
[51:44] kind so regardless of the kind of
[51:49] seats regardless of the Ws that the
[51:52] devil has
[51:54] planted at the end of the day
[51:57] the seeds that are being
[51:59] planted must bring forth their kind
[52:03] praise the Lord and now we are
[52:05] created in the image of God we are
[52:09] created by the spoken words and now God
[52:13] is
[52:14] confident that regardless of how the
[52:17] devil has
[52:18] fought from the beginning to change the
[52:22] course of the
[52:23] words he knows that he planted the the
[52:27] words he created us by the words he
[52:30] knows that in the evening time at
[52:33] Harvest Time the true bride the true
[52:38] seed of God must bring forth the
[52:41] word he must bear fruits of the
[52:45] word praise the Lord and that's what the
[52:47] prophet says in the message the spoken
[52:50] word he says praise the Lord he says
[52:54] that the true bright
[52:57] the true seed that was planted in the
[53:00] Garden of
[53:02] Eden we shall know them by the word you
[53:07] test them by the word you tell them the
[53:11] word and see if they shall believe it
[53:14] praise the Lord they may all profess to
[53:16] be
[53:18] Christians praise the Lord but at the
[53:20] time of
[53:21] harvest give them the word the word
[53:24] shall do a separation
[53:27] the true seed of God the Bible says my
[53:31] sheep know my voice so when you speak
[53:33] the word he shall hear the word he shall
[53:37] obey the word he shall follow the word
[53:41] praise the lord and there is nothing
[53:44] that can come
[53:46] between that True
[53:48] Believer and the words why because in
[53:51] the beginning he was made by the word
[53:55] praise the Lord and now even if the
[53:57] devil came along the
[53:59] way and brought a
[54:01] separation because the seed is in
[54:05] there the seed has to grow and the seed
[54:09] is growing and the Bible tells us that
[54:12] the
[54:14] master the master shall come in the time
[54:19] of harest to harvest back whatever he
[54:23] put in the ground and we are confident
[54:27] that in the end of times God shall come
[54:31] down to harvest
[54:34] whatever he
[54:35] planted in the beginning praise the Lord
[54:39] and so what does that lead us to it
[54:42] means that in the end
[54:45] times there shall be a
[54:47] people that shall
[54:50] manifest the seed that was planted in
[54:54] the Garden of Eden
[54:56] that Living God and now
[54:59] goded his
[55:01] course to lead his
[55:03] people by the word he never changes it
[55:07] he led them by the
[55:09] word praise the Lord and now he's to
[55:12] judge the people by the
[55:14] word praise the Lord because it is the
[55:18] word that he planted when he comes to
[55:22] judge he simply coming to look for his
[55:25] SE
[55:27] praise the Lord and so now when he comes
[55:30] he has to be
[55:31] identified and he has to identify
[55:35] himself by the word praise the Lord it
[55:38] has to be the same spoken
[55:41] word he sold in the
[55:43] beginning praise the Lord that's why he
[55:46] has always led the People by the
[55:48] word remember Israel his people his
[55:53] first bride he L them by the word
[55:57] praise the Lord he often sent a
[56:00] prophet to lead the People by the
[56:04] word until the people came to a
[56:07] point why because there was a
[56:11] [Music]
[56:13] tear that had been
[56:16] planted in the Garden of Eden praise the
[56:19] Lord and it has been growing All Through
[56:22] the
[56:24] Ages and now it came to a time during
[56:28] the times of
[56:30] Samuel when Samuel had grown
[56:32] old that the ERS of the church they
[56:36] looked at him and they looked at his
[56:39] children so they
[56:41] connived they said let us go and meet
[56:44] Sam let's go and speak to him that now
[56:49] we need a king of our
[56:52] own to lead us praise the Lord God had
[56:57] been Leading the
[56:59] People by his words he often sent the
[57:03] prophets to lead the People by his word
[57:07] he often sent out the word time Israel
[57:11] was
[57:12] going he sent the word to bring them
[57:15] back on track praise the Lord each time
[57:18] there was something
[57:20] wrong God sent the word to put the
[57:23] people back to the life
[57:26] the Lord but because there was a
[57:28] seat there was a tear and God allowed it
[57:33] there for a purpose he say allow them to
[57:37] grow together there shall be an
[57:40] identification at the time of
[57:43] harvest why because when I come I shall
[57:46] be looking for the seed which I
[57:50] planted and anything that is of a
[57:53] different nature shall be boundled
[57:55] together
[57:57] shall be burned praise the Lord and now
[58:00] they came and said 1 Samuel 8
[58:06] ver4 chapter 8
[58:09] verse4 then all the Elders of Israel
[58:13] gathered themselves together and came to
[58:15] Samuel and to Rama
[58:26] and said unto him behold Thou Art old
[58:29] and thy Sons walk not in thy ways now
[58:32] make us a king to judge
[58:45] us they wanted to be like other
[58:51] nations praise the Lord yet they were as
[58:55] special
[58:56] people it was a special
[58:59] seed but God when he created man he gave
[59:05] him a fre moral
[59:07] agent praise the Lord he created him by
[59:11] the word and he gave him the word to
[59:14] lead him but now God has given you the
[59:19] the
[59:20] opportunity either believe him or
[59:23] not that's why now the people they said
[59:27] we want to be like other
[59:30] nations give us a king judge us the way
[59:35] other nations
[59:36] are so now this was a turning
[59:39] point it was a
[59:42] crossroad that now Israel was turning
[59:45] away from the
[59:47] word and they wanted to be like
[59:51] others praise the Lord this is the same
[59:55] message the serpent brought
[59:58] Eve praise the Lord you can do this and
[1:00:02] be like
[1:00:04] others but now we are not
[1:00:06] created to be like others but we are
[1:00:11] created be like
[1:00:13] God why because we come from God and we
[1:00:17] must go back to
[1:00:19] God praise the Lord so there is nothing
[1:00:22] of us to desire anything from the world
[1:00:26] we are not of the world praise the Lord
[1:00:29] so our desires must be guided by the
[1:00:33] word of God our SS must be guided by the
[1:00:38] word of God we should not have the
[1:00:40] desire to be like
[1:00:43] others make us a king so we can be like
[1:00:48] others free moral
[1:00:51] agent you can
[1:00:53] believe God creates you his own image by
[1:00:58] his own word then he says go and have
[1:01:00] the
[1:01:01] reion all the things in the Earth are
[1:01:04] yours go rule over them and have
[1:01:07] dominion but here is my word here is my
[1:01:12] compass shall always guide
[1:01:15] you then he gives you the word but man
[1:01:20] the nature of man because of the free
[1:01:23] moral
[1:01:24] ages he makes
[1:01:26] decisions whether to believe or not to
[1:01:31] believe praise the Lord but like I said
[1:01:35] before the master said let them grow
[1:01:39] together praise the Lord let them grow
[1:01:43] together why because in his
[1:01:46] mind he knows that those that are his
[1:01:51] can never get lost that's why Jesus says
[1:01:55] praise the Lord we read that scripture
[1:01:57] last time Jesus said all them that the
[1:02:03] father has given
[1:02:05] me I shall lose
[1:02:07] none praise the Lord oh that the father
[1:02:12] has given to me I shall lose none I
[1:02:16] shall keep them until the last
[1:02:20] day praise the Lord so regardless of the
[1:02:24] doctrines that come
[1:02:27] because Jesus warned us in the Book of
[1:02:30] Matthew I think it's in chapter
[1:02:33] 24 he said yeah I'll put you to the
[1:02:38] world I have given you my
[1:02:40] words praise the Lord I have Tau you the
[1:02:43] words but now there shall come weird
[1:02:49] doctrines there shall come false
[1:02:53] prophets and those false prophets
[1:02:56] shall bring different
[1:02:59] doctrines and he said be
[1:03:02] careful because he shall be so close to
[1:03:05] the
[1:03:06] truth that if it were
[1:03:09] possible they would receive even the
[1:03:12] very
[1:03:13] elect praise the Lord so now Satan put
[1:03:17] on his
[1:03:18] skin praise the Lord and then he came
[1:03:21] and presented the word to
[1:03:23] Eve and says it is true
[1:03:26] it is what he said but this is what he
[1:03:29] made he made a Twist you have the the
[1:03:33] moral
[1:03:34] agents to
[1:03:35] believe praise the Lord but we have an
[1:03:39] assurance that we were in the mind of
[1:03:42] God praise the Lord that God created us
[1:03:45] in his own mind he created us by his own
[1:03:48] word and so we are the word of God and
[1:03:52] if we are the word of God Heaven and
[1:03:55] Earth shall pass away anything else
[1:03:58] shall fail but the word of God shall
[1:04:01] never fail so if you are created the
[1:04:04] image of God by the spoken words and if
[1:04:08] the Bible says that heaven and Earth
[1:04:10] shall pass away but the word shall never
[1:04:13] pass away that means to you and the word
[1:04:17] one so you are Eternal and you can never
[1:04:21] fa praise the Lord so now if you have
[1:04:24] the word
[1:04:26] a
[1:04:27] mirror praise the Lord you read the word
[1:04:31] and you are able to see yourself and see
[1:04:35] your name in the words praise the Lord
[1:04:39] and the Bible says in Romans chapter 8 I
[1:04:42] think around verse
[1:04:45] 35 because we know who we are there is
[1:04:49] nothing that shall ever separate us from
[1:04:53] the love of God there is nothing
[1:04:56] that can ever separate us from the word
[1:05:00] of Praise the Lord why we are
[1:05:04] planted by the word in the words and we
[1:05:09] shall we must bring forth the
[1:05:12] manifestation of the word of God in our
[1:05:15] lives praise the Lord why because that's
[1:05:18] what God is
[1:05:20] coming coming to harvest his word and is
[1:05:24] his word
[1:05:26] right praise the Lord because Jesus said
[1:05:29] if you believe me and you keep my words
[1:05:33] and keep my judgments I will not be
[1:05:36] under I am going to come and I'm going
[1:05:39] to be in you that you and I are one
[1:05:44] praise the Lord so now if Jesus dwells
[1:05:46] in
[1:05:47] us if the word of God because the Bible
[1:05:51] tells us that Jesus is the word of God
[1:05:55] praise the Lord and everything was
[1:05:58] created by Him and for him praise the
[1:06:03] Lord so you are
[1:06:04] created by Him by his spoken word and
[1:06:09] you are created for him so you came out
[1:06:12] of the mouth of God by the spoken words
[1:06:16] and you go back to God as the spoken
[1:06:19] what so now when he's coming he's coming
[1:06:23] to harvest that se
[1:06:26] which he planted in the Book of
[1:06:29] Genesis let us create man in our own
[1:06:33] image and he created
[1:06:36] man praise the Lord and that seat which
[1:06:40] went to the ground in the Book of
[1:06:43] Genesis that seed must be
[1:06:47] harvested when the time for Harvest
[1:06:50] is praise the Lord I'll take you to the
[1:06:53] to the message here what the prophet
[1:06:56] says in the message condemnation by
[1:07:01] representation he makes a statement in
[1:07:03] paragraph
[1:07:07] 29 and he says we
[1:07:10] know that we can't take an orange
[1:07:13] tree and grow citus fruits of different
[1:07:18] kind s
[1:07:21] or8 we can put lemons on it
[1:07:26] it will grow right in because it's a
[1:07:29] citrus
[1:07:32] fruit it will grow grape
[1:07:36] fruit and many other
[1:07:39] antangin and many other citus
[1:07:42] fruits but if that tree brings forth its
[1:07:45] own Branch
[1:07:48] again it will be an
[1:07:51] orange praise the Lord take that picture
[1:07:54] friends the prophet says you can have
[1:07:57] your
[1:07:58] or and you know what science has done
[1:08:01] today they do
[1:08:04] grafting praise the Lord so now they
[1:08:07] shall get this orange tree and then they
[1:08:10] cut
[1:08:11] it and he says the life in the
[1:08:15] tree is the orange it is the life that
[1:08:19] was put here and now it has been cut up
[1:08:24] and it branches have been taken off and
[1:08:27] says even if they bring other
[1:08:30] branches from other trees and then they
[1:08:34] come and graft it
[1:08:35] together yes if they bring a mangle
[1:08:39] tree it shall it shall bear the mang
[1:08:43] fruits but as long as the life inside
[1:08:47] here still
[1:08:48] there it gets a chance to bring forth
[1:08:53] its
[1:08:54] branches rather
[1:08:56] it shall still bring an
[1:08:59] orange why because the life on the
[1:09:02] inside
[1:09:03] here the orange and God says let us
[1:09:07] create man and in chapter two the Bible
[1:09:11] says after he had created man he got a
[1:09:14] hold of him and then he got a hold of
[1:09:18] him and he gave him his life praise the
[1:09:22] Lord God gave man his life
[1:09:25] how he gave him breath he breathed
[1:09:30] man and Man became a living soul that
[1:09:34] living soul
[1:09:36] is is the seed of God it Bears the life
[1:09:40] of God and as long as that seed is still
[1:09:44] there bearing the life of God regardless
[1:09:48] of how far the devil
[1:09:51] takes as long as the life is still there
[1:09:56] when the time comes when the right time
[1:09:59] has come that life shall come
[1:10:03] out praise the Lord and when the word is
[1:10:07] spoken when the spoken word
[1:10:09] go it shall recognize the
[1:10:12] voice praise the Lord when the word of
[1:10:15] God is
[1:10:16] preached shall recognize that
[1:10:19] voice why because it Bears the life of
[1:10:23] God praise the Lord
[1:10:26] the life of God is in
[1:10:28] there can never
[1:10:30] die praise the Lord and he says and we
[1:10:33] believe that there is to be a church in
[1:10:37] the last days that will receive both
[1:10:39] former and latter
[1:10:42] Reigns it will be scattered throughout
[1:10:44] the
[1:10:45] world in this laition age will be a
[1:10:49] church
[1:10:51] that that's called back to the original
[1:10:54] faith in God
[1:10:58] it will be a church that will have Jesus
[1:11:01] Christ walking in
[1:11:04] it manifesting
[1:11:06] himself the shout of the king will be in
[1:11:12] it in thisan
[1:11:14] church that says I am
[1:11:17] rich and I need nothing I am increased
[1:11:21] with
[1:11:22] Goods praise the Lord that has rejected
[1:11:25] the
[1:11:26] word the prophet says there is going to
[1:11:30] be a
[1:11:31] church that is coming out of this
[1:11:34] laition
[1:11:35] age why because in this age is a bright
[1:11:41] in this age is a person is a people that
[1:11:46] have the life of
[1:11:49] God which
[1:11:51] theyed before the
[1:11:53] beginning says they shall come to
[1:11:57] manifestation and they shall manifest
[1:11:59] Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ will
[1:12:03] manifest himself within them and he
[1:12:07] shall be king to
[1:12:08] them there shall be a people in the end
[1:12:11] times praise the Lord that shall
[1:12:14] identify
[1:12:15] themselves with the word not because
[1:12:18] they choose to but because their nature
[1:12:22] in the first
[1:12:23] place the nature of the words and it
[1:12:27] must identify itself with the
[1:12:29] words why it is Harvest Time the te must
[1:12:34] gather
[1:12:35] together the denominations must come
[1:12:38] together and the Bri the word of God the
[1:12:43] seed that is to manifest in the end
[1:12:45] times shall also get identified with
[1:12:49] Christ and Christ will manifest himself
[1:12:52] in
[1:12:53] them praise them living
[1:12:55] and how it shall be by the spoken words
[1:12:59] praise the Lord just the same way it was
[1:13:03] in the Old Testament when God LED
[1:13:07] Israel by the spoken word through the
[1:13:11] prophets and even when Jesus was
[1:13:14] coming praise the Lord he still sent a
[1:13:18] prophet who was
[1:13:20] rejected and he found his
[1:13:22] abort in the wilderness
[1:13:25] why because the rest of the
[1:13:29] denominations rejected him they couldn't
[1:13:32] contain
[1:13:34] him his life was different praise the
[1:13:37] Lord and now he kept himself there in
[1:13:41] the wilderness until the time appointed
[1:13:45] was
[1:13:46] come and when the time appointed was
[1:13:49] come the voice came out of the
[1:13:52] Wilderness and it went out the world to
[1:13:57] proclaim the first coming of
[1:13:59] Jesus it was a
[1:14:01] word that he spoke praise the Lord and
[1:14:05] now God promised us the same thing at
[1:14:10] the second coming of Jesus
[1:14:11] Christ he says there shall be a spoken
[1:14:15] word a word shall go
[1:14:18] forth do nothing but
[1:14:22] locate praise the Lord every SE
[1:14:26] wherever they
[1:14:27] are in the world and when this spoken
[1:14:31] word came for it began loc it was spoken
[1:14:36] it began loc it found you I don't know
[1:14:40] where found me found the other one found
[1:14:44] each one of us praise the Lord it was
[1:14:47] the spoken
[1:14:49] word and you were able to to listen and
[1:14:54] hear it
[1:14:56] and believe it because in you is the
[1:14:59] seed of the spoken
[1:15:01] words let us man it was the spoken word
[1:15:05] and he created man in the image of God
[1:15:09] created he them so we come into the
[1:15:13] world with that life praise the Lord so
[1:15:17] when the message of the evening Time
[1:15:19] Goes
[1:15:21] Forth brother he shall awaken
[1:15:25] that
[1:15:27] life it shall
[1:15:29] awaken that life in the seat that each
[1:15:33] one of us is
[1:15:35] bearing praise the Lord and nothing
[1:15:38] shall come in
[1:15:40] between praise the Lord and now I will
[1:15:43] take you to
[1:15:44] another I Willen you again to the
[1:15:47] prophet
[1:15:48] Joshua praise the Lord now Joshua was a
[1:15:53] type of Christ
[1:15:56] Joshua is a very good
[1:15:58] type praise the Lord remember he was
[1:16:01] always with
[1:16:03] Moses and the rest of the people when
[1:16:06] they were crossing
[1:16:07] over to can praise the Lord and so many
[1:16:12] people when they reached there there
[1:16:15] those that doubted but Joshua kept his
[1:16:20] fa Joshua kept the word why because
[1:16:26] Joshua he was a prophet and we believe
[1:16:29] that he was and God spoke to Joshua he
[1:16:33] often came and spoke to him and he gave
[1:16:36] him his word he say stand up I will go
[1:16:41] and I will fight for you and I will give
[1:16:44] you this land until you for an
[1:16:48] inheritance Joshua got that
[1:16:50] promise josua heard the word and he
[1:16:53] believed that word
[1:16:56] praise the Lord so when they reached
[1:16:58] over the people doubted but Joshua kept
[1:17:02] the word and he knew that at the right
[1:17:06] time God would give them the land praise
[1:17:10] the Lord he believed it and he had with
[1:17:13] him they believed and surely God gave
[1:17:16] them
[1:17:17] the praise the Living God let's get the
[1:17:21] M identification of Christ in all ages
[1:17:25] the prophet makes another
[1:17:27] statement and says God with his
[1:17:30] thoughts becoming
[1:17:33] material and then that brings us with
[1:17:36] eternal
[1:17:37] life and eternal life there is only one
[1:17:41] form of
[1:17:42] it that is God and then it is God
[1:17:46] expressed in his
[1:17:48] church like God expressed in his
[1:17:51] son it's the same God in all the time
[1:17:55] God above us God With Us God in us
[1:18:00] bringing the whole thing right
[1:18:03] back because he
[1:18:05] Eternal and whatever comes out of him is
[1:18:08] eternal so when the spoken word came out
[1:18:11] of
[1:18:12] him that spoken word was
[1:18:16] eternal praise the Lord that's why can
[1:18:18] never die and if we had the spoken word
[1:18:23] that came out of him
[1:18:25] the prophet says God is still bringing
[1:18:29] it right
[1:18:31] back the same spoken word which is spoke
[1:18:35] in Genesis is still bringing it right
[1:18:37] back into
[1:18:39] place as the
[1:18:41] bride praise the Lord so the Bride of
[1:18:44] Jesus Christ is the
[1:18:47] manifestation of the word of God in the
[1:18:50] end times praise the Lord and again he
[1:18:53] says
[1:18:56] in the same message remember in the
[1:19:00] beginning the only
[1:19:03] fortifi that God gave Adam and
[1:19:08] Eve was to stay behind his
[1:19:12] word that's all that's all he gave them
[1:19:16] to stay behind the word and that's the
[1:19:19] only thing that God has given to the
[1:19:23] church that God has given to the bride
[1:19:26] is the spoken word to stay behind the
[1:19:30] spoken
[1:19:31] word to be led by the spoken
[1:19:34] words praise the Living God because the
[1:19:37] spoken word is the shepherd
[1:19:41] himself
[1:19:43] spoken Jesus himself so we are to stay
[1:19:47] be to stand behind him and allow him to
[1:19:50] lead us and he says God will judge the
[1:19:56] world not by any certain
[1:19:59] group he will judge the World by Jesus
[1:20:02] Christ and Christ is the word he is the
[1:20:06] word in the beginning was the word the
[1:20:10] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:20:13] and the Word was made
[1:20:15] flesh and dwelt Among Us so he is the
[1:20:19] expressed word of God in every
[1:20:23] age he makes seem the same
[1:20:26] yesterday today and forever it was Jesus
[1:20:31] in Genesis when Jesus created the Heaven
[1:20:34] and Earth it was Jesus in Genesis when
[1:20:38] God created
[1:20:39] Us Praise the Lord he's the same spoken
[1:20:44] words that's what the Bible
[1:20:46] says everything was created by
[1:20:49] Him and for him by him in the beginning
[1:20:55] and for him because whatever was created
[1:20:57] by Him it shall have to go back to
[1:21:01] him praise the Living God and in some
[1:21:07] place he said if you love his what which
[1:21:11] we certainly
[1:21:13] do we love his word what proves that we
[1:21:17] love his
[1:21:18] word because we are part of him we are
[1:21:21] part of his word praise the Lord we are
[1:21:25] part of the word and so we love his word
[1:21:28] because the word is in US you can't
[1:21:31] separate yourself from the
[1:21:33] word because that's who you are that's
[1:21:36] who we are we were created by the word
[1:21:40] and if we are created by the word so
[1:21:42] that makes us the
[1:21:44] word praise the Lord so we can't
[1:21:46] separate ourselves from the
[1:21:49] word so now the devil shall try to
[1:21:52] separate
[1:21:54] bring all sorts of
[1:21:57] Doctrine but as long as the life of the
[1:21:59] word is in
[1:22:01] there the Lord when we hear the voice of
[1:22:05] the
[1:22:06] master we shall say Here I
[1:22:09] Am shall be identified by the word so
[1:22:13] now if God is to judge the World by his
[1:22:17] word which is Christ praise the Lord and
[1:22:22] Christ the word of God dwells in
[1:22:27] us which makes us the
[1:22:29] word that
[1:22:31] means that God will judge the
[1:22:35] World by you and
[1:22:37] me praise the Lord God will judge the
[1:22:40] World by Us Praise the Lord because we
[1:22:44] stayed in the
[1:22:45] world as the manifestation of the word
[1:22:48] of
[1:22:48] God we say in the world as the
[1:22:52] reflection of the word of God praise the
[1:22:55] Lord and we bear the fruits of the world
[1:22:58] and if God is to judge my neighbor he
[1:23:01] shall not judge my
[1:23:03] neighbor by Angels you shall judge your
[1:23:07] neighbor shall judge your neighbor by we
[1:23:11] ourselves because we lived amongest them
[1:23:15] and we expressed the words we expressed
[1:23:18] obedience to the
[1:23:19] world praise the Lord and why is God
[1:23:22] going to judge the world how did he
[1:23:25] judge the world in the times of Noah he
[1:23:28] judged the world praise the Lord when he
[1:23:31] brought the
[1:23:32] flood because of
[1:23:35] unbelief they never believed they spoken
[1:23:38] what that God sent through his Prophet
[1:23:41] God sent Noah to go and preach and the
[1:23:44] word which he spoke would be the one
[1:23:47] that was going to judge the rest of them
[1:23:49] why because those that
[1:23:51] believed pass over judgment
[1:23:54] but those that never believe were
[1:23:57] destroyed it was judgment and God is
[1:24:01] going to judge the World by his spoken
[1:24:05] word Jud the World by his word those
[1:24:09] that believe have passed over judgment
[1:24:13] but those that don't believe are
[1:24:16] condemned praise the Living God let's
[1:24:18] stand here to the message all the days
[1:24:22] of our life
[1:24:25] 1959 so you see we are just getting
[1:24:29] nearer home
[1:24:31] now the Messiah is being made
[1:24:35] known brighter brighter every
[1:24:39] day like Shadow
[1:24:42] coming it gets more and more and
[1:24:46] more until it becomes completely
[1:24:50] positive th when Christ and his
[1:24:53] bride un together then we will be one in
[1:24:57] him in the evening time this word must
[1:25:02] put on flesh in the evening time this
[1:25:06] spoken word must put on flesh to
[1:25:09] manifest the nature the image and
[1:25:13] likeness of God praise the Lord it must
[1:25:17] put on flesh once again such that the
[1:25:20] image which God s the image which was in
[1:25:24] the beginning in the mind of God and the
[1:25:28] words must unite to be one and when the
[1:25:33] word unit with that image then we become
[1:25:38] the manifestation of
[1:25:40] God the word put on
[1:25:43] flesh praise the Lord so we and Christ
[1:25:46] become
[1:25:48] one praise the Lord and that's what he
[1:25:51] says praise the Lord let's stand another
[1:25:54] quote here in that message the spoken
[1:25:57] word is the
[1:25:59] original he says now he's likening this
[1:26:03] to the
[1:26:04] tears and with the evening time remember
[1:26:08] that Parable it is speaks about the
[1:26:11] Harvest
[1:26:13] Time which Harvest time we are
[1:26:16] living because we are the bright of
[1:26:20] Jesus Christ in thean church age which
[1:26:24] is the last
[1:26:26] age of the
[1:26:28] Gentiles praise the Lord so now we are
[1:26:31] in the evening of the
[1:26:33] times we at that time of harvest we are
[1:26:38] at that time when God must come
[1:26:41] down take back whatever he
[1:26:45] planted and says El's
[1:26:49] Behavior Moses's
[1:26:52] Behavior John's Behavior
[1:26:55] leaving their field of
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:02] service many of the people didn't
[1:27:05] understand
[1:27:05] them it was because they was
[1:27:09] rejected their message the seed had been
[1:27:14] sown praise the Lord Elijah sold the
[1:27:18] seed Moses sold the
[1:27:20] seat John sold the seat and the seed was
[1:27:25] planted praise the Lord it had been swn
[1:27:29] and once the seed is
[1:27:31] swn what do you wait for you wait for
[1:27:35] Harvest praise the Lord and now God sold
[1:27:38] the seed what is he waiting for he's
[1:27:41] waiting for Harvest praise the Lord and
[1:27:44] what next judgment praise the Lord and
[1:27:48] say and was a sign to the people
[1:27:54] God that judgment was at
[1:27:57] hand planting was
[1:27:59] over I believe
[1:28:02] someday the real bride of Christ will be
[1:28:05] for to stop preaching the word of God
[1:28:09] the of it that's in
[1:28:13] reev denominations will force it to
[1:28:17] stop take its
[1:28:19] Mark you know when the Bible talks about
[1:28:21] the mark of the
[1:28:22] beast praise the Lord
[1:28:24] it's in the evening time that now
[1:28:28] denominations will force their rule over
[1:28:30] the
[1:28:31] church the Bri praise the Lord you
[1:28:35] either stop reaching or you have their
[1:28:39] Mark and then continue preaching praise
[1:28:42] the Lord but the true bright the true
[1:28:46] seed of God believes that there is only
[1:28:50] one
[1:28:51] God and there is nothing else other than
[1:28:55] that one God praise the Lord and
[1:28:58] regardless of the
[1:28:59] forces that denominations shall
[1:29:03] impose that will not
[1:29:06] change the faith and mind of the
[1:29:09] believer there is one
[1:29:12] God praise God and that's what shall
[1:29:15] identify Us in the last days in the
[1:29:19] evening of time praise the lord well the
[1:29:22] rest of the world
[1:29:24] Shall Gather together they shall be
[1:29:27] brought together by that doctrine of the
[1:29:31] three by that Doctrine praise the Lord
[1:29:35] of believing in
[1:29:36] Trinity and each of them shall receive
[1:29:40] the mark of the
[1:29:42] beast the Bride of Jesus Christ because
[1:29:46] she is a SE she's the
[1:29:49] wit praise the Lord she was planted by
[1:29:53] the master
[1:29:54] she cannot be
[1:29:56] adulterated her mind cannot be
[1:29:59] changed she was Tau right there is only
[1:30:03] one God and she cannot change that
[1:30:07] praise the Lord she has no control over
[1:30:09] it it's what she was told what was
[1:30:13] planted and it is what must come to
[1:30:17] manifestation there is one
[1:30:19] God the entire world gang up against her
[1:30:24] she will stand right with the
[1:30:26] words praise the Lord and we shall stand
[1:30:31] and judge the
[1:30:32] world praise the Lord because the rest
[1:30:34] of them Shall Believe The Trinity and
[1:30:38] they shall receive the mark of the be
[1:30:41] but we shall believe only one God
[1:30:44] because the Bible says there is but one
[1:30:47] God and you must love your God with all
[1:30:51] your heart he never said love your
[1:30:55] Gods love your Gods with all your heart
[1:30:59] with all your
[1:31:01] mind your soul and says I believe
[1:31:04] someday you will be forced and
[1:31:08] says then when the lamb will take his
[1:31:12] bright and judge the for
[1:31:15] this and judge
[1:31:21] the praise the Lord
[1:31:24] nothing separating the
[1:31:27] bright of Jesus from the word of God
[1:31:30] because the seed was
[1:31:32] planted it shall have to grow until it
[1:31:36] comes to
[1:31:38] maturity praise the Lord and when it
[1:31:40] reaches maturity it shall
[1:31:43] manifest the real true
[1:31:47] nature of the
[1:31:49] originator praise the Lord and says they
[1:31:51] can take away everything but man and the
[1:31:55] woman that has received the word and
[1:31:58] come into that personal relationship
[1:32:00] with
[1:32:03] it if you have believed this word and
[1:32:06] you have found a personal relationship
[1:32:10] with
[1:32:12] spoken there is nothing that can take
[1:32:16] this word
[1:32:18] out why it has found an
[1:32:21] AB and what is God
[1:32:25] we must manifest that
[1:32:27] word in the evening time praise the Lord
[1:32:31] let them grow together at the time of
[1:32:34] harvest we shall separate the wheat from
[1:32:37] the tears at the time of harvest at the
[1:32:41] time appointed of God praise the Lord
[1:32:44] God will come to harvest that
[1:32:48] seat spoken word which he saw in the
[1:32:51] beginning he says remember Moses
[1:32:54] born for the
[1:32:56] work had to wait on God for the extra
[1:32:59] gift for the
[1:33:01] job he had to go back and wait for the
[1:33:05] time appointed of
[1:33:07] God a certain phoh had to be on the
[1:33:11] throne and the people had to be had had
[1:33:15] to be wanting the bread of
[1:33:18] life in other words the prophet is
[1:33:20] saying that God everything that is to
[1:33:24] come to pass must always come to pass at
[1:33:28] the appointed
[1:33:29] time we have received the message that
[1:33:32] there is going to be a
[1:33:34] rupture that is the promise praise the
[1:33:37] lord and there shall be
[1:33:39] Rapture praise the Lord and it says that
[1:33:43] so many
[1:33:45] people look at the signs they are
[1:33:48] looking for the signs because God gave
[1:33:50] the prophet
[1:33:52] signs praise the
[1:33:54] And when they see the signs have passed
[1:33:57] and the end has not come then they begin
[1:34:00] to
[1:34:01] criticize and say this is what you
[1:34:04] believe you say your Prophet said this
[1:34:07] but now it has happened and the rupture
[1:34:10] has not come praise the Lord the prophet
[1:34:14] said Moses had to wait he was born for
[1:34:19] the work and he had to deliver the
[1:34:22] people from from Egypt to the promised
[1:34:25] land but he could not do it until the
[1:34:29] time appointed was
[1:34:31] come praise the Lord and now we cannot
[1:34:36] force the rupture to
[1:34:39] come until the time appointed of
[1:34:43] God and God cannot Place
[1:34:48] signs before his
[1:34:51] word praise the Lord God
[1:34:54] puts his word
[1:34:55] first and all the signs come after it is
[1:35:00] the word of God so the only sign that we
[1:35:05] can look for for the Rapture is the word
[1:35:09] of God it is nothing else praise the
[1:35:12] Lord it is not the signs Bible says you
[1:35:16] shall hear of w and rumors of voice but
[1:35:20] said let your hearts not be dismayed
[1:35:23] praise the Lord so signs shall come but
[1:35:27] we are not looking for the signs we are
[1:35:30] looking for the
[1:35:31] manifestation of the words we are
[1:35:34] looking for the
[1:35:35] manifestation of the children of God and
[1:35:38] the Bible says even nature is
[1:35:41] groing nature is
[1:35:43] gring nature was created by the spoken
[1:35:48] word so it has the life of
[1:35:52] God nature
[1:35:54] is able to
[1:35:56] behold the things that are coming we
[1:36:00] have seen the prophet speak about many
[1:36:03] things he spoke about I think it's a
[1:36:06] tsunami that was going to to happen
[1:36:10] somewhere and then there were birs that
[1:36:13] began
[1:36:14] migrating and leaving that that place
[1:36:18] why because nature is able to read the
[1:36:22] signs
[1:36:24] praise the Lord and now the Bible says
[1:36:27] that that nature is
[1:36:28] groaning groaning for what waiting for
[1:36:32] the
[1:36:32] manifestation of the sons of God waiting
[1:36:35] for the
[1:36:36] manifestation of the Bride of Jesus
[1:36:38] Christ and he says how can you tell me
[1:36:43] give me the word test how can you know
[1:36:47] speak the word see what they say about
[1:36:49] it if they don't believe the word they
[1:36:53] have no se
[1:36:55] in they are of the evil
[1:36:58] one praise the Lord but the bright
[1:37:02] praise the Lord though she was deceived
[1:37:04] at
[1:37:05] first the second
[1:37:08] bride was
[1:37:10] deceived they are deceivers of the third
[1:37:13] bride by hybriding the
[1:37:16] word or trying
[1:37:19] to God never placed signs ahead of his
[1:37:22] word
[1:37:24] God never plac s ahead of his
[1:37:27] words they were added for proof of the
[1:37:30] words but the word is the
[1:37:33] first to prove it Elijah said to the
[1:37:37] woman bake me a cake
[1:37:40] first then watch the miracle happen come
[1:37:44] to the word first then watch the miracle
[1:37:47] the SE word itself is what the Holy
[1:37:51] Spirit energizes
[1:37:54] and again he says let us stand like
[1:37:57] josua and
[1:37:59] C now let us stand like Joshua and
[1:38:03] C as we see the promised land coming
[1:38:08] Insight it's nearing the time to be
[1:38:11] given Joshua in Hebrew mean
[1:38:16] savior presents the promised time leader
[1:38:23] time
[1:38:24] leader to take the church over Cal
[1:38:29] represents the True
[1:38:30] Believer who stayed with Joshua so no
[1:38:34] matter what the people say they had the
[1:38:38] seed they had the
[1:38:41] seed and the seed must bring forth its
[1:38:44] kind so they exhibited the kind of the
[1:38:47] seed they they did
[1:38:51] Bear the seed of The Word of
[1:38:54] Promise the spoken word that never fails
[1:38:59] once it goes
[1:39:01] forth it says they know God promised
[1:39:04] them a
[1:39:05] l it didn't matter whether there was a a
[1:39:08] sign or
[1:39:10] not suddenly the word had to
[1:39:13] stand and they stood right with it and
[1:39:17] the time
[1:39:18] appointed God gave them the land gave
[1:39:21] them the portion
[1:39:23] now notice how God did
[1:39:26] it not move Israel until his appointed
[1:39:32] time they may have say Joshua you lost
[1:39:35] your
[1:39:36] commission you're all washed up why are
[1:39:39] you not doing
[1:39:41] something you used to do you know the
[1:39:46] Lord in moment and what was the will of
[1:39:50] God but this wise God sent prophet
[1:40:01] Prophet knew the promise of God and also
[1:40:05] knew to wait for that
[1:40:07] promise a clearcut decision from
[1:40:11] God for his time and when the time
[1:40:15] come God gave it to
[1:40:18] Jos who had stayed with him by the word
[1:40:22] for he could not not trust others he
[1:40:25] trust him so will it
[1:40:29] repeat he says God gave the promise to
[1:40:34] Joshua because Joshua stayed with the
[1:40:38] word no matter the criticism that
[1:40:41] came he stayed true with the
[1:40:44] word praise the Lord and he says the
[1:40:47] same will have to
[1:40:50] repeat that God will give the promise
[1:40:54] praise the Lord to the bride who has
[1:40:57] stood with the
[1:40:58] word no matter the
[1:41:01] criticism he said God sent our prophet
[1:41:05] and the prophet said
[1:41:07] ABCD he said you said your Prophet said
[1:41:11] that a woman will rule
[1:41:13] America but now Trump has won your
[1:41:17] Prophet is a false
[1:41:18] prophet stay with the
[1:41:21] words stay with the spoken
[1:41:24] God once he speaks his
[1:41:27] words praise the Lord it must come to
[1:41:30] pass he promised us in Malachi 4 that
[1:41:35] before the coming of the second coming
[1:41:37] of Jesus
[1:41:38] Christ he will send the Elijah the
[1:41:42] prophet and Elijah the prophet is come
[1:41:46] and he he has come and he has BR he has
[1:41:49] brought the message he has brought the
[1:41:51] mind of God for us
[1:41:54] stay right with the mind of God
[1:41:57] regardless of the
[1:41:59] criticisms praise the Lord if they come
[1:42:01] and say you said
[1:42:04] ABCD you said that Russia will destroy
[1:42:08] America but now see what what America is
[1:42:11] doing America is sponsoring
[1:42:14] Ukraine and Ukraine is killing Russia
[1:42:18] and Russia is doing nothing that has
[1:42:21] nothing to do with the spoken word
[1:42:23] the word went forth and it must come to
[1:42:27] pass the prophet says regardless of
[1:42:31] whatever they said to
[1:42:33] Joshua they told him remember Joshua you
[1:42:37] could say says the Lord speak the word
[1:42:41] that we can take this land but he said
[1:42:44] stand
[1:42:45] still at the time appointed of the
[1:42:48] Lord shall take the land and I want say
[1:42:52] this that bride of Christ we are the
[1:42:56] word
[1:42:57] manifested stay with the word regardless
[1:43:00] of the
[1:43:01] criticisms we know that it shall come to
[1:43:04] pass that the Lord shall come and he
[1:43:08] shall take away the bride and this world
[1:43:12] shall be ruled this world shall be
[1:43:15] judged for their unbelief in the same
[1:43:19] words they are
[1:43:21] criticizing stay right with the word
[1:43:23] but whatever God has spoken it shall
[1:43:27] come to pass he spoke his word and
[1:43:30] whatever he spoke it came to pass in
[1:43:33] Genesis saw the seed and the seed has
[1:43:37] been going through the
[1:43:39] world until the last age of the
[1:43:43] Gentiles and this seed must come to
[1:43:47] maturity and this seed is in me and you
[1:43:52] and it must come
[1:43:54] to
[1:43:55] manifest praise the Lord the nature of
[1:43:59] the father praise the lord we must
[1:44:03] manifest the nature of the father
