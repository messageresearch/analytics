man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of your mou even as we open our hearts and our ears receive from your mouth this word be a blessing to us I praying in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I want to welcome each of you and I want to say God bless you all amen such a cold evening but we trust the Lord that his presence is with us amen amen I want to appreciate the presence of our pastor amen and I appreciate God Amen for keeping him still strong the work of the Kingdom amen amen let's turn to the book of MTH read out quite a number of scriptures here amen and Jesus answered and spoke unto them by Parables and said then the Kingdom of Heaven is like certain King which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were beid to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and and the remnant took his servants and and treated them spitefully and slew but when the king heard thereof he was rough and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned them burned up their City let us pray precious heavenly father I have read this your word and I'm depending upon youres to bring down the thought of this scripture this evening for our edification bless it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen we may seated amen we shall continue down with the scripture amen amen and still let's continue with Matthew and verse verse 8 say then yes to8 then sayi he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find beat the marriage so the servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was fished withs and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how comest thou in hether not having a wedding Gage and he was Speech praise the Lord so for our text this evening we shall take a study on God's requirements to the bride God requirements praise the Lord so we have read this Parable the parable about the wedding supper and now Jesus speaks this Parable and says there was a certain King and he made a marriage for his son and though he sent out servants to go and call the invited guests for the wedding but they would not come and then he sent again the servants to go and ask whoever they find along the way to come and attend the wedding and they came but now to the wedding because it is a wedding it's a special occasion and so there was a special garment that was given to each of the of the guests praise the Lord and every one of the guests that attended the wedding had to pass through the door or they get to the wedding to be dressed with a garment praise the Lord so this garment praise the Lord made all the all the all the guests look uniform small or great rich or poor they all just looked the same because of this G and now as the King was moving through he finds a man who does not have the gar on then he asked him how did you come in here how come you do not have the Garment on you praise the Lord and now the man the Bible says and he was speechless he was speechless because he had no excuse to give to the king praise the Lord because by matter of fact that he attended the wedding it means he had had the invitation he had as others were being invited so he also had the call and the instructions were clear that must pass through the door to receive the Garment qualify us for the wedding but he was speechless because he heard it but possibly he did not obey and so he went by other ways and found himself to to the wedding and the Bible says then say the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into out Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth so now the Rob is all that was required for no matter how smart you dressed no matter how rich or poor you were without the whether you were a sound to the king but without a ro you had no place at the wedding supper praise the Lord so this is the requirement that the king demanded of each of the invited guests and this garment was given of the king freely as long as anyone heard the voice they obeyed the voice and came through the door the servant was already at the door giving every invited guest a garment praise the Lord because that was the only requirement that they had praise the Lord and when the invitation had gone out the king never specified he never said look for the well behaved he never said look for the well dressed or look for the educated for the most eloquent but he said whatever you find them to come praise the Lord and whoever heard the voice and obeyed the voice of the servant and came in by the door they were given their wedding praise the name of living God tonight I want to say this that Christ the says Jesus Christ is the door now God requires us of one thing praise the Lord he has given us his instruction he has given us his requirements that we must have for us to enter into the rupture praise the Lord but even before the Rapture God has laid down a few requirements for us to meet in order to appear before him in order to claim our blessing before him in order claim our healing before him praise the Lord and without that instruction we cannot meet God we cannot please God and now what are those remember from where we took our scripture the requirement that was there was the RO and then the next thing the invited guest must listen to the instructions and obey the instructions and enter into the wedding The Wedding by the door and when they reach the door they are given a garment a Rob praise the Lord to cover them a Rob their identity prise the Lord a Rob to hide their Darkness maybe some came with that with a lot of that and they could not be worthy to stand before the king for the wedding the fact that they obeyed the voice and entered through the door they were given a garments to cover their Darkness praise the Lord and even though one came with by with nakedness that Rob covered their nakedness environment by which nobody could enter wedding place without praise the Lord and now here God has given us Grace and he has provided us instructions he has provided us with requirements that we must have as the Bride of Jesus Christ first of he sent us his son praise the Lord and when he sent us his son he sent the son to Die For Us Praise the Lord he sent the son and Jesus Christ came and he preached the gospel he lived the life praise the Lord and then he was sacrificed upon the cross for us and now if we believe on him praise the Lord if we believe on Jesus Christ the Bible says behold I stand at the door and knock God sends Jesus and now Jesus says I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice praise the Lord and they open the door I will come into them and will Ser with them praise the Lord and so if Jesus is the it's only by Jesus Christ the lord as he stands at the door and knocks praise the Lord by Knocking by standing at the door the voice is the word that is being preached it is the word that is preached our souls it is the voice of God speaking to us open our hearts for him to enter in the Bible tells us Jesus is the door praise the Lord and whoever is coming unto God must first come through Jesus Christ it's only by Jesus Christ that we are able to reach God so first of all we have to express our willingness we have to express our obedience to the voice that is spoken out the word that is preached praise the Lord And now when we express our obedience praise the lord we now listen to The Voice and when we obey the voice praise the lord we open our hearts and he comes in and he servs with us praise the name Living God says behold I stand at the door and KN If any man hear my voice so hear the requirement is for us to hear the voice and when we hear the voice obey the voice and open your heart for him to come in Praise the Lord and when he comes in he makes an AB in our hearts he makes an in our lives and he gives us of his life so the requirement there is for us to believe when you hear the voice believe the voice when you believe the voice praise the Lord accept what the voice says and obey the voice so we see this man come by some other way not through the door and so he couldn't get the Garment praise the lord we must come through the door to get dressed with a ro a garment for the wedding before we can be accepted into the wedding we must come through Jesus Christ we must come through the word we know Jesus Christ prise the lord the scripture tells us that Jesus Christ is the Lamb that was offered for our sins praise the Lord and regardless of how that we made as long as we accept the voice come through Jesus Christ his blood that we poured upon the cross sufficient cleanse us of all our sins to make us clean so we can enter through the door to the wedding praise the Lord so we come through Jesus Christ praise the Lord he cleanses us of our sins he wases us of our sins he forgives all our sins forgives all our weaknesses understand Bible says when we believe and we make confession and you are baptized you are then given the holy spirit so now when you come through the door which is Jesus Christ after he has cleansed you and has forgiven us of our sins then he gives us the Holy Spirit which is the requirement for us to meet God praise the Lord he gives us the Holy Spirit which is the requirement for us to reach God praise the Lord and we know that the ultimate purpose of our life is to enter into eternity praise the Lord the goal clim of our calling is to enter into eternity praise the lord and there is no can enter into eternity without the holy spirit so now when we come through Jesus we are given the Rob we are given the Holy Spirit which is the seal that seals us and presents us worth for the wedding praise the Living God so now the prophet says here this but this man must have come in a window he slipped in now look when the king the bridegroom said to him friend how did you get in that showed there had been some good oldfashioned holy preachers down on the ground for he stood speechless he had sat maybe in the Chicago meeting he know better he know it before God he couldn't say I never had about it so he had been in the in some Holy Ghost meetings he had seen the lame heal the Blind and seen the great miracles of god he stood speechless and what did God said do with that man find him hand and foot and throw him in outer Darkness suit yourself friend suit yourself that's the gospel Jesus's own words it wasn't only a parable it was a prophecy and it will be the way someday so tonight when the gates are open and Waters are flowing free and everything is ready and the father knocks at your heart and says you've been playing Church long long enough it's time for you to get right he says I would advise you to go to the door I would advise you to go to the door and get a ra B and come to the supper open the door of your heart receive from God every other time every moment of Our Lives open the door of your heart receive from God because that's the requirement obedience to the and that's just good enough listen to The Voice obey the voice go the way of the voice and Christ says I'll come in and I'll come him and him with me and I'll with you so each time God speaks each time the spirit speaks let's be open the doors of our hearts and let him in to stand with us to support us to encourage Us Praise the Lord because as we are go as we walking we get so many frustrations along the way we get so weak along the way but when we open the doors of our heart and allow him in he encourages us when we get do frustration he encourages you because he says behold I stand and only if you listen to my voice and open your heart I will come in and I will Ser with you so when you get through frustration he will be ready with you to encourage you to move onise the Lord when you get into lucky he will support you he provides for you praise the Lord when you get into a sickness he's there with you he shall heal you why because you've opened your heart and you allowed him you been obedient to the voice of God that's the requirement obey the voice and accept him to be part of you to be a part of your life and he shall go with us all the way praise the Lord he says I will come in him I'll St with him accept the voice and open our hearts open the doors of our hearts and Let Jesus Christ enter in Praise the Lord so each time the gospel is preached open your heart sometimes the scriptures may be very hard for a human mind to understand open the door of your heart let the heart feed in let the heart take in allow God to come in and be a part of your life praise the Lord praise the Lord he says I'll be with you so accept him when you accept go by his word accept the spoken word and when the word is a part of us when we go by the word everywhere of our life you go by the word he keeps you in his word and he keeps encouraging his God doing is preparing your soul preparing our hearts preparing our garments and when when we are F praise the Lord when we are yed up to the word praise the Lord total obedience the Propet says total obedience to the word of God us to the Token the token is all that God requires us part of that wedding supp praise the lord it's the token the white Rob that ashers us to the wedding to the rupture so when we are with God he will take us through the way through the Journey on Earth and even when the life here is ended still God takes us all the way to the rure all the way to Eternity behold I stand at the door obey to The Voice open The Voice open your heart and I'll will come in I'll will be with you praise the Lord says come out from among them and I will receive you come out from among them that don't believe and I will receive you obey the voice open your heart and I will receive you second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 17 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate says the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and I will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters says the Lordi come out from among them make yourself separate and what does what separates us the word of God that separates us from unbelief of God that separates us the rest of the world so he says come out be separate and touch not the unlean thing and I will receive you I am the door praise the Lord I am the door and my sheep hear my [Applause] voice and when I call out they hear they are obedience Jesus Christ at the door he is the door to our Salvation praise the Lord and says my sheep hear my voice when I speak out the sheep hear my voice why they obedience to the voice obedience is all that God [Applause] requires obedience is all that the shepherd requires of the sheep obey the voice come out from among them and be separate he asked Moses go tell my people I I will take them out of Egypt I want them to go and worship me and when they obey and got the land which I have prepared for them I shall be a God to them and they shall be my people praise the Lord come out from among them separ God could not speak to them could not allow them toship him while they were still in Egypt he require that they get separated from elements of unbelief to be a separate people praise the Lord to worship him and says when he separate yourself from among them I will receive you and he does not only receive us says he shall be a father unto us and who is a father a person that is there we look up praise the Lord in case of any need we look up to the father in case there is any kind of necessity you run up to the father because you are sure that the father supplies all your needs so he says come up here and I will be a father to you and you shall be my sons and you shall be my daughters praise the Lord separation is all he requires of us separation is all Moses and the rest of the group required for God to bless them and once you obey that's all he requires of us and you shall be my people you shall be my sons you shall be my daughters once you obey that voice and you obey the voice and you go by the voice you just need to trust and obey his word and let God move remember we have no control over life situation you have no control over your sickness when you fall sick you can go get medication but you can't guarantee that the medicine that you taking will heal you praise the Lord you can't you don't have any control over your healing all you got is to trust and and believe that it is finished work of once you believe you let God move praise the Lord he says I am the door marthew 10:7 then Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them Matthew Matthew all that ever came before me are thieves and robers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man ENT in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find P so the requirement we see here that anyone that comes to God must come by and through Jesus Christ I am the door and anyone that comes by me and enter in through me shall be saved and he shall go out and shall come in and you shall find pasture it's a guaranted blessing when we come by the of Jesus Christ AED blessing that we shall go out and shall come in and we shall find our blessing praise the Lord so I am the door how does he become the door because by his precious blood the blood of Jesus Christ our sins are forgiven and we are Justified and cleansed and made holy before God so one must come by Jesus Christ and without him we cannot find God praise the Lord without Jesus we cannot be God praise the Lord and what does Bible say in the book of of John chapter one Jesus is the word so without the word of God you cannot meet God praise the Lord in the beginning was the word and that word was with God and that that word is God and Jesus is the word of God without the word you cannot meet God and so we see this man maybe when he heard the word of God he came by some other way and he rejected the only proed way of the Cross rejected Jesus Christ but he heard the word he sat under the preaching he had the servant speaking out invting all of them for the [Music] supper come for theer for the wedding there is the wedding of my master's son come to the wedding repent of your SS wash Yourself In The Blood come by the door and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and maybe he never listened and he thought he would find himself in there maybe he never open the door of his heart praise the Lord so each time he start before the service and the word of God was being preached maybe he thought that was not for him and maybe he sent it someone else praise the Lord and he never opened the door of his heart and he never received his Ro but Jesus says I am the door praise the Lord and anyone that wants to meet God must come through the door God is provided way is requirement for us to meet him praise the lord we must have the faith must trust the word whatever the word says obey and do according to what the word has say if it seems to be very difficult even if it seems to be very difficult grace is sufficient ask for the grace of God to enable you take his word ask the grace of God to help us take him at his word and then let trust the word of God whatever the word of God says let's obey and Trust we know of a woman praise the Lord who was in the Bible the Bible talks about her she had a blood issue shall suffer 12 years and the Bible says shall spend all her living upon Physicians shall move from one physician to another Lord but not found and now here comes one day when Jesus was on his way to go and pray for J's daughter praise the Lord the Bible says the crowd was too much and the crowd strong Jesus but there was this woman because she had heard that Jesus is the door she had heard that Jesus is God is provided to her healing what Jesus had done she had heard a voice the spoken word so she believed it and she trusted and so when she saw Jesus praise the Lord she said I don't want him to pray for me but in his word he say by his stripes I am healed so she took up that word so she pressed all through go and meet Jesus and she had Faith that's the first requirement she had faith and on faith she trusted God praise the Lord she had believe she believed in the word of God believed that when she touches him should be healed there was nothing that she required all she requireed was to touch because she had faith that as long as Jesus was there and she touched him her condition was complete her condition was hard she did not require Jesus to pray for her well Jus required that Jesus goes to pray for for his daughter this woman praise the Lord she had faith that she was healed and all was requiring was to touch her touch him touching him could not heal her but have faith have trust in the word have trust in Jesus is what heal her praise the Lord so when she went there it was a confirmation of her faith she was healed praise the Lord that's what God has proved for us to and obey his word prise the Lord if we need healing let us believe let's believe his word he gave all his promises praise the Lord he promised he is the Lord God who heal all our diseases praise the Lord so if we are in sickness in moments of sickness let's trust we have no control over them but he whom we believe has control over the sickness so when you believe and you confess it for your healing you receive your healing praise the Lord why because he given in the word and his word never fails praise the Lord he's always there behold I stand at the door anyone that opens the door I will come in and I'll be with him so when he's sick and he has faith in me I shall take away his sicknesses that is the promise walking in the promises of God obeying the word of God and walking in the requirements of God as long as we are sure that we we have made the requirements of God let us rest our Souls praise the Lord as long as we are sure of the word he has provided all in the word let us rest and be sure that whatever we have need of shall come our way without any doubt with all our faith and trust in his word shall come to pass praise the lord we have seen so many men women in the Bible that trusted in the Lord that waited upon the Lord as long as they were sure that they made the requirements of God whatever they prayed for came to pass and it's a cloud of witness it's a cloud of witness and is written in the book of Hebrews that all those men and women are a cloud of witness praise the lord we look up to them you look up to job and look at your situation and you believe God for for it shall come to pass that you will overcome the situation why because about job that even when everything else was destroyed God came through for him in the moment of your destruction and in distress you Lear trust God you learn to believe God you learn go by his word you learn surrender and obey his word all he requires of us is surrender ourselves and allow him to work praise the Lord Our God wants to be glorified and the only can be glorified when we surrender ourselves and tell him we canot do anything on our own then he comes in to take over why he has to be glorified in every situation that a Believer faces all he requires of the believer is their faith in the world believe on the finished work and all shall be well praise the that's the only requirement that he requires of us Fai believe and trust in his and all these other Vues patience temp brotherly kindness all of them charity praise the Lord shall come through let's have faith praise the Lord and believe God and take God at his word praise the Lord that's all the woman required fa and what happened the Bible says that when Jesus when she touched him Jesus looked around and says who touched it was a Special Touch of face we can tou Jesus through our prayers a prayer of face praise the Lord until God is convinced to turn around praise the Lord to your situation to turn around our condition and say there is a special touch yes all of them have touched him all of them have touched him there is a special touch a touch of fa praise the Lord when you touch him with a touch your faith praise the Lord all our weaknesses all our troubles all the sickness and all them kind of things they all vanish away why we have put all our faith in the finished work he says who touched me and then they said but everyone has been touching praise the Lord and now in verse 30 of The Book of Mark he says who touched my clothes and one all his disciples said unto him now he see the ising you everybody is touching and pulling you why do you now tell us who touched you and he looked around about to see God praise the Lord a touch of Faith praise the Lord he looked around say there is a special t someone here surrendered themselves who who surrendered themselves and they have complete faith and when they touch me praise the Lord they have faith that whatever they have need of shall be given unto them he say someone touched me but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth tou of faith our Touch of faith our faith in prayer praise the Lord moves the attention of God the prayer of this woman have faith move the attention of Jesus and this is what Jesus said unto her daughter remember he says come out from among them separate yourself I shall be a father to you and you shall be my sons and daughters so Jesus said unto her daughter now that you have separated your faith from them have complete faith in me he says thy faith has made the Wall go in peace and be whole of thy plague and it settled it all the 12 years of suffering by faith it was all settled that's all God required for her healing was enough that was all she needed faith in God faith in the word of God she believed it and it come to pass and God counted it against her for her face praise the Lord just like the story of the eag that had gotten into a wrong Nest praise the lord we know the prophet teaches us of that story of anlet that was lost out there and was among the cheeks praise the lord and there was the voice of the mother eag in the nest in confusion in the cheeks but the mother Eagle never rested until she find the IG praise the Lord so she went out hunting she went out hunting she went out hunting and she was whistling out as she was whistling out it was the voice of God going out calling out bright reaching out our hearts behold I stand that your I that you're opening obeying and opening the doors of their hearts The Voice the was coming in was coming in and day by day it was building virtue after virtue virtue after virtue praise the Lord and we know that one day iglet took a stand and says but what is this voice that keeps coming around it looks quite familiar with my nature praise the Lord and we know that are the eag that are lost out in the world we have the life and the nature that does not belong on Earth praise the Lord and each time the word is going forth you find yourself that there is a part of you that is not comfortable with the things of the world while we live there there is a nature as the word is preach as the world is going forward there is a nature that is responding the word and there is a nature on the inside of you that is not comfortable with the things of and Affairs of the world why because you have a nature of God and we are simply lost out in the world and we know that someday someday our nature the nature of God shall overtake this nature and we shall go to see God so now the story of the iglet tells us something special about our nature praise the Lord and now our lives we know belong to God we have a life thats to get over this one and somewhere you feel your life isn't connected to the things and the demands of the world even when you get Beil you get Beil and get entangled you AR free you find it a burden until you got the Lord in prayer and speak to him about the situation we have a life awaiting us after here and all that God requires of us is obedience the spoken words the voice of the seventh angel obey the spoken words for we believe the voice of spoken of the seventh angel as is written out in the Book of Revelation 10 the Declaration of Jesus Christ and his works complet right so let's listen that voice and open the doors of our hearts every time we have opportunity to hear the voice let's hear the words open the the doors of our hearts let's open the doors of our hearts and allow God in the mother Eagle speaks out the iglet say yeah right you don't belong here the voice that you're hearing is your true nature the voice that we hear the voice of the spoken word the voice of the seventh angel it speaks about our life it is the voice that touches our hearts that touches the life in our souls tell us we don't belong here but we belong up there and says little e m says try it a little harder focus on Calvary yeah their noises all over as the eaglet focus on the voice of Mother Eagle being willing to listen obey the instructions of the Holy Spirit and leave it upon him be certain that you've made the requirements of God obedience faith belief patience in his word and keeping ourselves in sub to the leers of the Holy Spirit he says that sounds good M now what must I do after she had heard the voice of Mother ego she asked M the voice sounds good it has reached out my soul and I feel little bit good but what must I do said I tell you honey the way you go to do you go to jump you go to jump and get your feet off the ground and then just go to flapping them little wings of yours just flap them as hard as you can just flap as hard as you can when you heard the word speak about your faith you got a little faith

little bit harder and the w a little bit harder f seem to be small but even with that little face flapping come by here he sat here he sat where am I at now you're asking God in your heart she said Sun you're going to have to jump higher than that oh I can't even get you there she soed back down again he thrown his little feet up in the air and begin to flop his wings as hard as he could and the first you know he felt himself being lifted up with her little face after she had heard the voice of Mother E asking her to FL her wi the instruction was simple get on your feet your little wings keep flapping them flap them we know it may be very hard but keep trusting and believing and praying your faith keep praying believing and he says before you know he felt himself being lifted up why
