[1:41] verse three
[1:44] it has started from verse 1.
[1:47] now it came to pass on the third day
[1:50] that Esther put on her royal April and
[1:54] stood in the inner Court of the King's
[1:56] house over against the King's house and
[1:59] the King sat upon his Royal throne in
[2:03] the Royal house over against the Gate of
[2:05] the house
[2:08] this is
[2:27] when the king saw yesterday Queen
[2:30] standing in the court that she obtained
[2:34] favor in his sight and the King held out
[2:37] to Esther the golden scepter that was in
[2:41] his hand so Esther Drew near and touched
[2:45] the top of the scepter Hallelujah
[2:47] foreign
[3:15] but you can imagine there was
[3:17] destruction that was rooming
[3:22] there was destruction that had been
[3:26] declared against the Jews
[3:29] praise the name of Allah and then here
[3:32] we have the enemy
[3:35] Satani that is always after you

[3:42] and down are you again moving like a
[3:44] roaring lion

[4:08] praise the name of Allah you see that
[4:11] the goodness of God
[4:13] even when when people were evil before
[4:17] him
[4:18] a man like
[4:21] he had caused the death of numbers
[4:25] and then when he met the Prophet Elijah
[4:28] and then Elijah pronounced judgments
[4:36] himself
[4:38] and then he went and sought the Lord in
[4:41] Santa Claus
[4:46] I'm not going through some of these
[4:48] things in his days
[4:50] he got favor
[4:52] he got some kind of relief
[4:56] you find a man like Cain
[4:59] after he had killed his brother
[5:03] then he started crying to God now people
[5:06] are going to kill me now people are
[5:08] going to kill him he prayed yes what the
[5:11] Lord he gave him a protection
[5:38] foreign

[7:33] Praise the name of our Lord don't limit
[7:36] yourself
[7:38] may not be necessary in my name but it
[7:42] is the same God that asking you this
[7:45] morning what would you have me to do for
[7:47] you
[7:50] what will you have me to do for you
[7:52] when he got the lepers
[7:55] and they cry down to him
[8:00] like Isaiah
[8:02] I need to be clean
[8:37] what is your request
[8:39] and the scripture says it shall be done
[9:18] [Music]
[9:42] what they needed of him
[10:05] he made Provisions
[10:08] when he was somewhere and they were
[10:11] drowning
[10:13] he created peace
[10:15] praise the name of our Lord you may also
[10:18] be needing peace in your heart
[10:22] you may need peace in your house you may
[10:25] need peace in your house
[10:28] I need peace at my heart I need peace in
[10:32] my soul you may be needing come facts
[10:40] Lord I'm so traveled at my place
[10:44] that could be your request that would be
[10:48] your petition I said Lord come down in
[10:51] my collection
[10:52] Lord come down in my scenario
[10:59] he gives us eternal life
[11:03] but doesn't
[11:04] mean
[11:05] but he gives us all the other things
[11:11] he said seeking first the kingdom of God
[11:15] seeking first the kingdom of God
[11:20] then all these other things
[11:28] we need to behold the face of God
[11:31] and when you behold his face then you
[11:35] speak to him Lord this is my scenario
[11:38] Lord this is my trouble Lord this is my
[11:42] name and then you see how the Lord will
[11:44] provide
[11:46] praise the name of Allah the way the
[11:48] king supplied for Esther
[11:51] praise the name of our Lord let us go
[11:54] back there is Isaiah chapter six
[11:57] praise the name of our Lord and then
[12:00] verse 6.
[12:01] then through one
[12:04] unto me having a life call in his hand
[12:07] which he had taken with the tongues from
[12:11] off the altar
[12:12] um
[12:21] [Music]
[12:22] and he laid it upon my mouth and said
[12:26] Lord this has touched thy lips and thy
[12:30] iniquity is taken away and thy sin is
[12:34] purged
[12:37] do you know they come here
[12:41] [Music]
[12:47] so Isaiah in the presence of God
[12:51] he identified his needs
[12:55] [Music]
[13:01] praise the name of us if there is any
[13:04] cleanness also in us
[13:06] and then in the presence of God say Lord
[13:10] this is where I'm failing
[13:13] no this is what I'm lacking in myself
[13:17] you just need to be open in your house
[13:20] you just be himself
[13:25] [Music]
[13:36] [Music]
[14:17] [Music]
[15:20] climb up here
[15:24] [Music]
[15:37] [Music]
[16:19] and then the seraphim
[16:31] foreign foreign
[17:10] foreign
[17:12] [Music]
[18:05] Lord this is my weakness and when Daniel
[18:09] cried to the angel
[18:17] the word
[18:20] the more Daniel had that one Daniel
[18:23] the more strength than your gain Daniel
[18:26] he stayed in the presence we need also
[18:30] to behold the face of God and when you
[18:33] hear the voice of God and then that
[18:35] voice of God
[18:37] changes you from within and then you
[18:40] find that your weaknesses are going your
[18:44] failures are going down
[18:47] something like Isaiah
[18:49] all his sin was taken away everybody
[18:56] and he was able to stand upright
[18:59] with confidence in the presence
[19:04] and that's what God wants of Us
[19:07] Praise the name of Allah in Revelations
[19:11] chapter 22.
[19:13] when the Lord was telling John
[19:16] before they come Canada praise the name
[19:19] of Allah then he said sure like
[19:22] [Music]
[19:25] he said amen he didn't say ah wait wait
[19:30] wait
[19:31] there are some businesses
[19:35] I want to finish in my house
[19:38] I have a course to do wait wait wait I'm
[19:43] still young
[19:48] [Music]
[20:19] right there
[20:20] absolutely
[20:37] praise the name of our Lord Zachariah
[20:40] chapter 3 and verse 1.
[20:46] so the scripture says
[20:49] and he showed me Joshua the high priest
[20:53] standing before the angel of the Lord
[20:55] and Satan standing at his right hand to
[20:58] resist to him
[21:09] now you can imagine that Joshua the high
[21:12] priest
[21:14] standing in the presence of God and then
[21:18] Satan instance standing on his right
[21:20] hand
[21:21] and right hand of authority
[21:26] right hand to perform the duty of God
[21:30] right hand to offer incense
[21:39] to do the word of God and Satan was
[21:43] standing on that hands
[21:45] to resist him
[21:48] to attack him to oppose him foreign
[21:56] [Music]
[22:17] foreign
[22:45] foreign
[22:50] and he has Satan was resisting the high
[22:54] priest
[22:55] and the high priest was the most holy
[22:59] man on us
[23:01] the high priest was the most righteous
[23:04] man
[23:08] is resisting him
[23:10] and he's going in the presence of God to
[23:14] intercept for all the nation
[23:18] all the sin of them
[23:20] can Satan says
[23:23] you're not going to
[23:25] do it
[23:28] he stood in the presence
[23:31] now you look what this scenario
[23:34] University
[23:35] and the Lord said unto Satan
[23:38] the Lord rebuked the offset even the
[23:43] Lord that has chosen Jerusalem
[23:45] is it not a brand cracked out of fire
[23:54] Joshua is standing in the presence of
[23:57] God
[23:57] and then Satan resisting him
[24:01] the Lord took
[24:05] concerns
[24:06] to come against the center
[24:10] who was actually resisting Joshua
[24:14] and the Lord said Center
[24:16] the Lord rebukes
[24:19] praise the name of it but you see Satan
[24:23] left Joshua with filtered garments
[24:30] foreign
[24:40] but when you come before the presence of
[24:43] God
[24:44] Don't just run away
[24:49] praise the name of Allah when you come
[24:51] into the presence of God
[25:05] don't just go away
[25:08] praise the name of Allah like in John
[25:10] chapter 8.
[25:12] they got the woman in adultery because
[25:15] and when they come down
[25:18] they take her to the temple
[25:21] where Jesus was yes praise the name of
[25:25] our Lord John chapter 8 and verse
[25:29] praise the name of our Lord
[25:33] the Bible says Jesus went unto the Mount
[25:37] of Olives
[25:38] and early in the morning he came again
[25:40] into the temple and all the people came
[25:43] unto him and he sat down and taught them
[25:47] yes
[26:01] and the secrets and the Pharisees
[26:04] brought unto him a woman taken in
[26:07] adultery and when they had set up in the
[26:11] Middle East
[26:19] praise the name of Allah
[26:21] the righteous people
[26:24] now they've got this one in sin
[26:27] and then they take her in the temple
[26:32] before Christ
[26:35] we have gotta in a downtrend
[26:39] ism
[26:43] praise the name of Allah they all come
[26:46] into the presence of God
[26:48] but what brought them in the presence of
[26:50] God
[26:53] the Pharisees
[26:55] when they come in the presence they come
[26:59] to our Jews
[27:02] son when Joshua went into the presence
[27:05] of God Satan went to our church
[27:10] praise the name of our Lord how about us
[27:13] when we come into the presence of God we
[27:17] come to I choose our neighbors
[27:20] we come to our choose our colleagues
[27:24] oh they are so bad people
[27:28] when
[27:31] when you know
[27:33] when in the book of Acts chapter 9.
[27:38] praise the name of our Lord when ananias
[27:42] went into the presence of God he was
[27:45] also telling God this Soul here
[27:49] is a very dangerous man
[27:53] but the Lord corrected him
[27:58] praise the name of our Lord so when the
[28:01] Pharisees brought the woman God foreign
[28:58] foreign
[29:17] [Music]
[29:32] [Music]
[29:42] foreign
[29:53] they say they have homework
[29:58] the Bible says they went away but yeah
[30:03] they were convicted because of their
[30:05] sins
[30:07] so they went back with their sins but
[30:11] the woman that they were accusing
[30:14] stood before the presence of God
[30:17] until she was forgiven
[30:20] we also need to do the same thing
[30:24] the Bible says though your sins be as
[30:29] rendered Scarlet yeah
[30:36] we need to stand before the presence
[30:47] the woman who was brought before as a
[30:52] sinner
[30:52] left as a righteous yes
[30:55] the people brought her who were choosing
[30:59] they left when they are convinced
[31:02] praise
[31:16] and you know in the Scriptures it gives
[31:20] you know stories
[31:23] for things we can compare
[31:26] when the righteous people oh the
[31:29] self-made righteous people
[31:32] the Pharisees
[31:34] when they had John preach they started
[31:38] asking him
[31:43] when they had Jesus preach who gave you
[31:46] that Authority
[31:49] but when the Sinners
[31:51] had John preach what did they tell him
[31:55] what shall we do
[31:59] the Pharisees when they had them
[32:02] preached
[32:16] [Music]
[33:04] in Canada
[34:04] like when Moses went to the mountain and
[34:08] he was in the presence of God
[34:11] and when Moses was coming down and then
[34:15] he came down to the camp yeah and then
[34:18] they saw him his face was shining
[34:22] even nonsense would come into the
[34:24] presence of God let us go back with our
[34:28] faces shining
[34:30] to our neighbors shining at our places
[34:36] and then they say we are he has been
[34:39] with the Lord
[35:12] let us go to this message
[35:15] praise the name of our Lord
[35:19] in his presence
[35:23] so the prophet says
[35:25] after Jacob addressed all the night
[35:31] in confessing his sins
[35:35] you remember the place he was
[35:38] it was called penery
[35:42] penly Penny the word Finley in the
[35:46] Hebrew
[35:47] means face of the almighty God
[35:52] praise the name of our Lord what a good
[35:55] place to wrestle yeah
[35:57] coming into the presence of God and then
[36:01] you wrestle no this is my fear Lord this
[36:06] is
[36:13] instead of the word of God something
[36:17] that the devil was putting again on your
[36:19] mind which was not right and when you
[36:22] started the world when you hear the
[36:24] message it is
[36:28] like Joshua the High Praise standing
[36:32] before the presence
[36:43] giving him confidence anointing him
[36:48] we have also come into the presence
[36:54] Jacob the little shyster
[36:58] yeah
[37:03] his name was Jacob
[37:05] which means it's a planter that is a
[37:09] deceiver
[37:10] had to run all of his life
[37:15] away from God
[37:18] but when he got one time in the presence
[37:22] of God
[37:25] in the face of God he got a hold of God
[37:30] and wouldn't turn him loose
[37:34] we need more Jacobs
[37:37] hold on the face of God
[37:40] in the presence of God he stayed until
[37:44] it was Sun up yes
[38:43] Lord this is the day to overcome all my
[38:46] weaknesses
[38:47] Lord this is the day to overcome all my
[38:49] my challenges
[38:52] let it be the day and say Lord
[38:58] I need your deliverance I need your
[39:01] Victory
[39:02] praise the name of our Lord when we come
[39:05] in the presence
[39:06] beholding the face of God
[39:08] praise the name of Allah
[39:11] what a great thing it was now
[39:14] to know that he had wrestled through
[39:18] that he had seen the signs of God
[39:22] he had had dreams about God
[39:25] but this was one time
[39:28] he was in the face of God in the
[39:32] presence of God think of it friends
[39:37] in the presence of God a man is changed
[39:43] [Music]
[39:45] now he could walk with God
[39:49] he was a different man than what he was
[39:53] before he went up there
[39:55] the bat was now over
[39:58] and he began to build an altar yeah he
[40:03] hadn't been used to building waters you
[40:05] know
[40:06] but I tell you when he come in the
[40:10] presence of God
[40:12] you want to build a notice someone
[40:15] you want to find somewhere where you can
[40:19] pray foreign
[40:48] you need in the message
[40:51] a man running from the presence of the
[40:53] Lord
[40:54] he says lay out in the presence of God
[40:59] then with our hearts not our hands
[41:04] not so much but our hearts before God
[41:09] until he has seasoned us but
[41:14] through and through
[41:36] to where we can show others
[41:40] Jesus Christ lives yes
[41:44] we want to believe that research and
[41:48] remember where Jonah went
[41:51] God was in the boat
[41:53] God was in the storm
[41:56] God was in the fish
[41:58] he went on being right along with Jonah
[42:03] until his perfect will was done
[42:08] that is right and if he's ever after
[42:21] but you will be miserable
[42:24] until you come back and do the thing you
[42:29] started out for him to do at the first
[42:31] place
[42:35] don't go run from presence of God
[42:40] face up to eat
[42:43] you believe it is the truth
[42:47] then if it is the truth it is worth
[42:51] living foreign
[43:17] and then chapter one
[43:21] praise the name of our Lord
[43:25] now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah
[43:29] the son of amitai saying arise go to the
[43:33] Navy the great City and cry against it
[43:37] for their wickedness is come up before
[43:39] me but Jonah rose up to flee unto
[43:43] tashish from the presence of the Lord
[43:46] and went down to Joppa and he found the
[43:49] ship going to tashish so he paid the
[43:51] fair thereof and went down into it to go
[43:55] with them and tashish from the presence
[43:58] of the Lord
[44:42] this is a very interesting scripture
[44:46] we
[45:08] and Reigns
[45:10] from the presence of God now the
[45:14] question is where was the presence of
[45:16] God
[45:18] praise the name of our Lord because the
[45:21] Bible says he ran away from the presence
[45:24] now where was the presence
[45:29] praise the name of Allah just read verse
[45:31] 9 and 10.
[45:35] now Jonah was telling these people and
[45:39] he said unto them I am an Hebrew and I
[45:44] fear the lord
[45:46] the god of Heaven
[45:48] which has made the Sea and the dry land
[45:52] then we are the men exceedingly afraid
[45:56] and said unto him why have you done this
[46:01] for the many knew that he fled from the
[46:04] presence of God because he told them
[46:12] so where was the presence
[46:18] so the Bible says instead of going to
[46:22] the Navy
[46:23] he went to tashish
[46:26] now if we went to the Navy
[46:28] we'd also be running away from the
[46:30] presence of God
[47:10] the same thing with us
[47:13] if we are in the presence of God if we
[47:17] are doing the will of God then we are
[47:20] beholding the festival
[47:22] praise the name of our Lord so every day
[47:25] keep yourself be holding the face of God
[47:30] doing the will of God
[47:32] keeping yourself in the presence
[47:39] he was running away from the presence if
[47:43] he was going to the Navy the place that
[47:46] God told him
[47:47] he was staying in the presence
[47:52] are we in the presence of God
[47:55] praise the name of our Lord oh you say
[47:58] yes we are in charge we are in the
[48:00] presence of God how about at your home
[48:03] are you in the presence of God
[48:36] then the face of God
[48:39] foreign
[49:06] and the Lord spoken to Moses saying
[49:08] Speak unto Aaron and unto his son saying
[49:11] on this one you shall bless the children
[49:14] of Israel saying unto them
[49:17] foreign
[49:54] praise the name of our Lord he says the
[49:57] Lord bless you and keep you the Lord
[50:01] make his face shine upon you
[50:06] and be gracious unto you and lift up his
[50:10] countenance upon you
[50:12] and give you peace
[50:16] God blesses us
[50:19] with his face shining upon him
[50:23] with his continence
[50:26] verse 26. the Lord lift up his
[50:30] countenance upon thee again
[50:45] and then verse 15.
[50:54] Psalms 89 15.
[50:58] he said blessed is the people that know
[51:02] the joyful sound they shall walk O Lord
[51:05] in the light of thy continence
[51:19] they walk in the light of his
[51:22] countenance
[51:25] you know it's the glory of God that
[51:28] comes around your life
[51:31] when we receive the word of God
[51:34] you are receiving the power of God
[51:38] and you are receiving the creative power
[51:41] of God
[51:42] the power that transforms us
[51:46] now if you had weaknesses and then that
[51:50] weakness goes away
[51:53] then you are being transformed
[51:57] when you are being transformed praise
[52:00] the name of our Lord then you full you
[52:03] fulfill the purpose for your creation
[52:07] you manifest that which is in you
[52:11] praise the name of Allah so the Lord
[52:14] wants his first to shine upon us
[52:17] [Music]
[52:18] the Lord wants us to have his continence
[52:26] his continence failed
[52:30] praise the name his countenance
[52:34] when we come into the presence
[52:37] we need to leave this place when the
[52:41] continents of God
[52:43] is upon us
[52:47] we need to leave this place
[52:50] when our faces
[52:53] are shining you know there is a nature
[52:56] of making your face foreign
[53:08] a busy go a busy go when you put them on
[53:11] your face it will make your face shine
[53:17] but that's not what I'm talking about
[53:20] I'm talking about
[53:22] that your first shining into your
[53:25] amazing because of the glory of God
[53:29] God coming down in you will come praise
[53:34] the name of Allah and then he makes your
[53:36] face shine
[53:39] what does it do when you meet people
[53:42] what's in Canada who are traveled
[54:46] accumulator
[55:12] praise the name of our Lord Acts chapter
[55:14] 6 and verse 15.
[55:16] Illuminator the Bible says and all that
[55:21] sat in the council looking steadfast on
[55:24] him so his first shine as he had been
[55:27] the face of an Angel
[55:32] available
[55:43] praise the name of Allah
[55:46] Stefan shining the glory of God in him
[55:51] he first ministered to them the word of
[55:54] God
[55:58] foreign
[56:36] and then read in verse seven the summer
[56:38] Canada comes out
[56:40] so the scripture says
[56:43] but if the ministration of death written
[56:47] and engraved instance was glorious so
[56:51] that the children of Israel could not
[56:53] steadfastly behold the face of Moses for
[56:57] the glory of his countenance which Glory
[56:59] was to be done away
[57:02] oh
[57:25] verse 13.
[57:30] which put a veil over his face and the
[57:34] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[57:37] look to the end of that which is
[57:39] abolished is
[57:51] but their minds were blinded for until
[57:55] this day remaineth the same Veil and
[57:58] taken away in the reading of the Old
[58:01] Testament which well is done away in
[58:04] Christ
[58:08] is
[58:25] but even unto this day when Moses is
[58:29] read the veil is upon their heart is
[58:40] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[58:44] Lord the veil shall be taken away
[58:52] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[58:56] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[59:02] [Music]
[59:08] but way all with open face be holding us
[59:12] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[59:16] changed into the same image from glory
[59:19] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[59:23] Lord
[59:47] so the Bible is telling us when Moses in
[59:52] the Old Testament when he when his face
[59:55] was shining he put on a veil
[59:59] and then the scripture is telling us
[1:00:02] that that Veil is now upon the heart
[1:00:06] you know when the law is read
[1:00:10] they are still a veil upon the hearts of
[1:00:13] the people
[1:00:14] to praise the name of Allah until that
[1:00:18] way
[1:00:19] they can't say Beyond
[1:00:22] because a veil covers
[1:00:28] in verse 16. that if our hearts turn to
[1:00:33] the Lord
[1:00:35] then the veil is taken away
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:10] is it possible
[1:01:13] you may have come with weaknesses this
[1:01:15] morning
[1:01:17] but you need to have the veil of
[1:01:19] unbelief get away
[1:01:23] in the presence of God
[1:01:26] can we can it do for me this is
[1:01:32] oh I wish I was there
[1:01:35] in Branham
[1:01:38] and then when the prophet is Discerning
[1:01:42] say now you you there this is your
[1:01:46] problem
[1:01:48] the Bible says don't say so
[1:02:00] don't say so
[1:02:04] praise the name of Allah and then there
[1:02:06] are others oh when are we going to
[1:02:08] organize a confession
[1:02:10] and then that anointed
[1:02:15] the Bible says don't say something
[1:02:18] what does the Bible say the word is near
[1:02:23] you
[1:02:25] foreign
[1:03:07] foreign
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:04:31] so in verse 18 he says
[1:05:17] and then the Bible says and then we
[1:05:20] Behold The Glory of
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:06:15] let us go to Psalms 4.
[1:06:19] and then verse 4.
[1:06:22] Psalms chapter 4 and then verse 4. in
[1:06:28] the scripture says
[1:06:31] standing away and sinning not
[1:06:35] commune with your own heart upon your
[1:06:37] bed and be still seller
[1:06:40] was
[1:06:45] um
[1:06:51] offer the sacrifices of righteousness
[1:06:54] and put your trust in the Lord
[1:07:03] there have been many that say who will
[1:07:06] show us any good Lord lift though up the
[1:07:10] light of thy continence Upon Us
[1:07:23] put gladness in my heart more than in
[1:07:27] the time that they are corn and their
[1:07:30] wine increased hotel is
[1:07:40] let me down in peace and sleep for the
[1:07:45] Lord only maketh me dwell in safety
[1:07:55] praise the name of our Lord he says God
[1:07:58] will put gladness in my heart
[1:08:02] and then he says that gladness is
[1:08:06] more than this thing I know when
[1:08:08] somebody is harvesting um
[1:08:11] praise the name of Allah because the
[1:08:13] Bible says
[1:08:15] they go sowing in tears
[1:08:19] but they come rejoicing
[1:08:22] you know with thieves but the Bible says
[1:08:26] God put such gladness in your house
[1:08:36] we just need to continue beholding his
[1:08:38] presence
[1:08:40] Lord I want to behold yourself
[1:08:43] I want to look into your face and the
[1:08:47] more you see his face
[1:08:48] is the more you are changed your
[1:08:51] commercials is the more you are
[1:08:52] transformed is the more your weaknesses
[1:08:56] it's the one you become strong
[1:09:01] Psalms 8.
[1:09:05] the Bible says
[1:09:07] turn us again oh God and cause thy face
[1:09:11] to shine and we shall be saved
[1:09:58] who was doing Havoc foreign
[1:10:15] first John chapter 3 and then verse 1.
[1:10:20] the scripture says behold what manner of
[1:10:24] love the father has bestowed upon us
[1:10:27] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:10:29] therefore the world knows us not because
[1:10:33] it knew him not available
[1:11:15] foreign
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:12:15] foreign
[1:12:27] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:12:30] be yeah
[1:12:31] but we know that when we shall appear
[1:12:36] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:12:41] him
