[1:15:48] Jeremiah chapter
[1:15:51] 32 amen let's ser
[1:15:56] pray father we thank
[1:15:58] you for your presence Among
[1:16:01] Us father it's such a great
[1:16:06] opportunity to see that we can walk
[1:16:09] through under the
[1:16:11] blood and come to your
[1:16:14] presence that we may find Mercy in the
[1:16:18] time of
[1:16:20] need and this time
[1:16:22] father we just pray that you may step
[1:16:25] out as a
[1:16:27] teacher speak to our
[1:16:30] hearts and whatsoever seed you
[1:16:33] give I pray that you may store it into
[1:16:36] our
[1:16:37] souls and then water it with the Waters
[1:16:41] of the Holy
[1:16:43] Ghost for it to bring life we commit the
[1:16:46] entire
[1:16:48] service and the needs of the
[1:16:50] people into your hands that never fail
[1:16:55] in Jesus name
[1:16:58] amen so here we are in Jeremiah chapter
[1:17:04] 32 when Jeremiah was in prison for the
[1:17:11] prophecy uh
[1:17:13] concerning Israel going to Babylon for
[1:17:16] 70
[1:17:19] years the word of the Lord came to him
[1:17:22] in prison
[1:17:26] say your
[1:17:32] cousin amen will come demanding that you
[1:17:37] buy his
[1:17:40] field he did not come to
[1:17:43] Hanah the prophet that was opposed to
[1:17:48] Jeremiah but
[1:17:51] Jeremiah and that prophecy there has to
[1:17:55] declare that there will be a
[1:17:59] return amen if you are a
[1:18:02] seed there will always be a
[1:18:05] return when the enemy touches his that
[1:18:08] hand upon
[1:18:10] him and you know hania was so
[1:18:15] strong among the people that he was even
[1:18:19] stronger than the right
[1:18:22] Prophet sometimes your position is
[1:18:25] stronger than your authentic
[1:18:29] voice but when we remember the
[1:18:32] principle Fe not little
[1:18:35] FL we shall always hold on the
[1:18:38] center amen so we shall pick up from
[1:18:42] verse
[1:18:43] 9 and I bought the field of Hanam my
[1:18:47] uncle's son
[1:18:55] that was in another thought and weighed
[1:18:58] him the money and 17 shakles of
[1:19:06] silver and I subscribed the
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:11] evidence and sealed
[1:19:15] it and took
[1:19:18] witness and weighed him the money in the
[1:19:21] balances
[1:19:25] may the Lord had blessing the reading of
[1:19:26] his
[1:19:28] word amen the scripture you may be
[1:19:31] seated the SC says I subscribed the
[1:19:38] evidence and sealed
[1:19:41] it amen you know to seal it was to hide
[1:19:45] it
[1:19:47] away from public
[1:19:50] scrutiny it can only be seen
[1:19:55] at a time when it should be
[1:19:59] authenticated with the original
[1:20:03] copy amen so the sealed
[1:20:07] copy contains the same details of the
[1:20:11] cell as the same I mean as the open copy
[1:20:16] did amen let's take a
[1:20:19] Bible which has got a seal like
[1:20:23] this like a man
[1:20:26] so you
[1:20:27] write and you
[1:20:29] seal you understand what I mean just an
[1:20:33] example and then
[1:20:36] again the same
[1:20:38] material is in an open
[1:20:41] copy that is not
[1:20:44] sealed are you together with me so then
[1:20:47] we come and read the details about the
[1:20:51] ownership
[1:20:54] now if there is an
[1:20:56] argument we shall go to the sealed
[1:20:59] copy when it's
[1:21:02] revealed it must
[1:21:04] agree with what is written in the
[1:21:07] book are you together with me the book
[1:21:10] was sealed on the back
[1:21:13] side amen but when it was
[1:21:17] revealed it had to agree with what was
[1:21:21] in the book amen so I took evidence of
[1:21:25] the
[1:21:26] PES verse
[1:21:32] 11 both that which was sealed according
[1:21:36] to the law and custom and that which was
[1:21:47] open I gave the evidence of the purchase
[1:21:50] to Baruch the son of nah
[1:21:57] the son of
[1:21:59] Messiah the in the sight of Han my uncle
[1:22:07] son in the presence of the
[1:22:10] witnesses subscribe to the book of the
[1:22:21] purch before all the Jews that s in the
[1:22:24] court of the
[1:22:28] prison and I charged bar before
[1:22:33] them th say the Lord of
[1:22:37] host the god of
[1:22:39] Israel take this
[1:22:43] evidences this evidence of the
[1:22:46] purchese both which is
[1:22:49] sealed and this evidence which is
[1:22:52] open and put them in
[1:22:59] vessel that they may
[1:23:02] continue many
[1:23:05] days amen for thus says the Lord of
[1:23:11] host the god of
[1:23:13] Israel houses and
[1:23:16] field houses and field and Vineyards
[1:23:20] shall be possessed again in this land
[1:23:30] amen so they were going soon in
[1:23:36] captivity but you see for Jeremiah to
[1:23:42] redeem his brother's
[1:23:45] property was a
[1:23:48] sign was a
[1:23:50] sign that they will come back into the
[1:23:53] land again
[1:23:56] there'll be
[1:23:57] possession they'll be buying they'll be
[1:24:02] selling amen and at that
[1:24:05] time
[1:24:07] everybody returns to his own
[1:24:14] inheritance praise the Lord so Hebrews
[1:24:17] chapter
[1:24:18] 10 I want to go there with
[1:24:21] you and verse seven
[1:24:25] he says then
[1:24:28] say I come in the volume of the book it
[1:24:33] is written of me to do thy will oh
[1:24:44] God the will of
[1:24:47] God you see because this is
[1:24:50] Jesus prophetically speaking
[1:24:54] amen and he says I
[1:24:57] come in the volume of the
[1:25:00] book which is written of
[1:25:03] me when Jesus came everything that he
[1:25:08] was going to
[1:25:09] do not my will oh father but your will
[1:25:13] be done and he's saying here that the
[1:25:17] will of
[1:25:18] God was already written of him in the
[1:25:21] volume of the
[1:25:24] are you together with me amen so I want
[1:25:28] for a title this
[1:25:31] morning your
[1:25:34] will your
[1:25:36] will is
[1:25:40] written your
[1:25:42] will is written so I want to speak on
[1:25:46] the will of God to them
[1:25:54] the word will is very
[1:26:02] rich I don't know how we can interpret
[1:26:05] this
[1:26:08] but like the word will in
[1:26:19] English in
[1:26:22] grammar will is an expression of a
[1:26:26] future
[1:26:29] tense you will finish the work
[1:26:33] tomorrow you will go to church
[1:26:36] tomorrow like my
[1:26:39] grandchildren when they asking about
[1:26:42] church they always ask you now it
[1:26:44] becomes
[1:26:46] night and morning then we go to church
[1:26:50] so they count the day the day and the
[1:26:53] night
[1:26:54] to be one day that's the accounting of
[1:26:57] the Lord amen so it's an expression of
[1:27:01] what will be handled in the
[1:27:05] future
[1:27:07] will I
[1:27:12] will I'll go to
[1:27:14] church amen so you people in the English
[1:27:19] language just keep the word will
[1:27:24] of the future
[1:27:26] test then we have a
[1:27:30] will to meet a person making known his
[1:27:36] desire of how maybe his to be uh
[1:27:42] administered after his
[1:27:46] demise he makes a
[1:27:49] will in this a man desires to die
[1:27:58] tested you know not in
[1:28:01] tested but to die
[1:28:04] tested so it's a
[1:28:06] will he reflected his
[1:28:09] will so and so becomes the
[1:28:13] hair and this is what he's going to
[1:28:16] do so in this
[1:28:18] two you know will and will
[1:28:24] we shall cross the borders at
[1:28:28] will because in both of them is actually
[1:28:33] determination of the
[1:28:36] future amen so I want to say that the
[1:28:40] will of
[1:28:42] God is the will for
[1:28:45] you are you together with me yeah we
[1:28:49] shall get to a
[1:28:50] point where you see the grace of God
[1:28:55] so in the natural
[1:28:57] life like in my life the testator writes
[1:29:01] the
[1:29:05] will amen when he sees the demise in
[1:29:10] view you know if I'm dying I write a
[1:29:15] will because I see my demise
[1:29:25] but in Christ your
[1:29:28] will was written before the foundation
[1:29:33] of are you together with me me I will
[1:29:38] write that my
[1:29:40] car goes to so and
[1:29:42] so my land go to so and so my house go
[1:29:48] to so and so became because I came
[1:29:52] without anything
[1:29:56] I worked for that and I see that my end
[1:29:59] is
[1:30:01] coming I
[1:30:03] testate and I
[1:30:06] write but now the most important
[1:30:10] thing is that in Christ your will was
[1:30:15] written before the foundation
[1:30:18] of okay so Ephesians chapter
[1:30:22] 1 and verse one
[1:30:24] I want us to be very very very observant
[1:30:27] this
[1:30:29] morning Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:30:32] by the will of
[1:30:35] God Ephesians

[1:31:01] desired that was the testate of
[1:31:05] God God a
[1:31:08] will that Paul you are going to become
[1:31:11] an
[1:31:14] apostle you see the test read thou

[1:31:35] for the
[1:31:37] body for Paul says Paul an apostle by
[1:31:42] the will of
[1:31:47] God so I said the will of
[1:31:51] God becomes a will for you
[1:31:57] are you together with me so here we come

[1:32:20] wealth and you are born with an estate
[1:32:23] for you

[1:32:28] Christ oh praise the Lord so in
[1:32:33] Ephesians he says having predestinated
[1:32:38] us the adoption of
[1:32:40] children by Jesus Christ
[1:32:43] himself according to the good
[1:32:47] pleasure of his will he predestinated
[1:32:52] us to the
[1:32:54] adoption that every one of us will be

[1:36:30] manifested
[1:36:32] Sons then we we occupy our
[1:36:37] iner let us say something about our
[1:36:39] inheritance here do you love him this
[1:36:44] morning
[1:36:46] nothing will permanently stand between
[1:36:50] you and your inheritance
[1:36:53] because your
[1:36:54] inheritance is your
[1:36:57] portion of the Holy Ghost which you
[1:37:01] receive amen you see when the Holy Ghost
[1:37:06] comes because we are different members
[1:37:09] of the
[1:37:10] body we cannot operate the
[1:37:13] same the hand is different the leg is
[1:37:16] different but both of them they've got a
[1:37:20] portion amen from I mean of the
[1:37:24] are you together with me so when you
[1:37:27] receive the Holy
[1:37:30] Ghost there is an inheritance you've
[1:37:34] received and that
[1:37:36] inheritance will work in your
[1:37:39] life according to how
[1:37:42] God for
[1:37:44] you amen listen now we shall go to
[1:37:49] Galatians it has been a very wonderful
[1:37:52] work for me there
[1:37:54] amen the book of
[1:37:56] Galatians is a very wonderful
[1:37:59] book you see
[1:38:02] Jesus is so
[1:38:06] upset between you know to much upset
[1:38:10] with the
[1:38:13] Galatians more than he does get upset
[1:38:17] with the
[1:38:20] Corinthians are you together with me
[1:38:24] yeah the Corinthians
[1:38:27] were but if they knew the grace of
[1:38:31] God then the grace of God would deliver
[1:38:35] them and build them into the state of a
[1:38:39] perfect but the Galatians who had begun
[1:38:43] in that Grace had come down into the law
[1:38:47] and Paul was wondering how will the law
[1:38:50] which has already failed
[1:38:53] perfect
[1:38:56] them come on
[1:38:58] now let's go to Galatians
[1:39:02] 3:15 Breen I speak after the manner of
[1:39:05] men though it be but a man's Covenant
[1:39:09] yet if it be confirmed no man disal or
[1:39:14] there
[1:39:49] praise the Lord he says listen here
[1:39:53] we are dealing with the Divine
[1:39:57] Covenant there's no way it can
[1:39:59] fail so he telling the
[1:40:02] Galatians that any kind of
[1:40:05] Covenant even if it's a natural
[1:40:09] Covenant once it has been
[1:40:13] appended no can no man can add to it no
[1:40:17] man can change it are you together with
[1:40:20] me so he comes to verse 16
[1:40:28] now where the promises
[1:40:34] made he says not un to seeds of many but
[1:40:39] as of one unto thy seed which is
[1:40:51] Christ so theen possess the
[1:40:56] land is you know a
[1:41:00] shadow of was receiving the Holy
[1:41:04] Ghost are you together with me you see
[1:41:08] the
[1:41:09] Covenant of Israel entering into the
[1:41:13] land is a shadow for
[1:41:16] you receiving the Holy
[1:41:20] Ghost amen the promise to Israel
[1:41:24] was a
[1:41:25] natural but the promise to the Seed of
[1:41:30] Abraham which is you is the Bas of the
[1:41:33] Holy Spirit and when this Holy Spirit
[1:41:37] comes he comes you know designed to own
[1:41:55] the spirit which comes
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:42:01] brother he comes the work that for in
[1:42:12] Him Praise the Lord so our brother s
[1:42:16] here he receives the Holy
[1:42:19] Ghost but the way he receives the Holy
[1:42:22] Ghost
[1:42:24] the Holy Ghost has been
[1:42:26] designed in such a way that he can only
[1:42:31] be able to help
[1:42:34] Silas to do what God ordained for
[1:42:37] him so that's an
[1:42:42] inheritance oh praise the Lord so the
[1:42:47] law which came 430 years after the
[1:42:50] promise to Abraham
[1:42:54] amen could not defy could not
[1:43:00] deter amen Israel from occupying the
[1:43:05] promise because the law came at
[1:43:11] SI after they had even left the land of
[1:43:15] Egypt and they were headed into the
[1:43:18] promise when the law came it could not
[1:43:22] put them back
[1:43:24] they had to go
[1:43:25] forward because God had made a covenant
[1:43:30] he doesn't fail on
[1:43:35] Covenant Amen to the Jews the promise
[1:43:39] was the land and they received it even
[1:43:43] after Mount
[1:43:45] Si the law could not
[1:43:48] hinder the gra to possess the
[1:43:51] land amen
[1:43:53] and listen now out here in the galatian
[1:43:58] people they were trying to put them back
[1:44:00] on the
[1:44:02] law which law had
[1:44:04] failed to give Israel the
[1:44:07] land because if they were going
[1:44:10] in by the strength of the Lord nobody
[1:44:14] would make it but they went in by the
[1:44:17] strength of
[1:44:19] Grace he tells them you did not POS that
[1:44:24] land because you were
[1:44:26] righteous but you were Hard Hearted
[1:44:30] people amen that's what God told so
[1:44:33] there is no law which gave them the Land
[1:44:37] There is no law which can give you the B
[1:44:40] of the Holy
[1:44:42] Ghost amen it's a gift of
[1:44:46] Grace that God has given to us and I was
[1:44:50] telling you in our galatian series
[1:44:54] that many people think that Grace is a
[1:44:58] weakness but Grace is
[1:45:01] strength the law is
[1:45:04] weakness because it was handled by
[1:45:07] man are you together with me it was
[1:45:10] handled by man which man had to
[1:45:13] pay amen his own
[1:45:17] atonment before you could even atone for
[1:45:19] the
[1:45:20] people but Grace priest
[1:45:24] here the Lord Jesus
[1:45:29] himself amen praise the Lord so the Holy
[1:45:35] Ghost is a straight promise to the
[1:45:39] elect amen so Galatians
[1:45:43] 3:18 it says for if the
[1:45:48] inheritance be of the
[1:45:51] law it is no more of
[1:45:54] promise but God gave it to Abraham by
[1:46:01] promise our
[1:46:04] inheritance is already
[1:46:07] written our
[1:46:09] inheritance was given before the
[1:46:11] foundation of the
[1:46:13] world our
[1:46:15] inheritance was given before the LA
[1:46:21] [Applause]
[1:46:23] amen so the L has
[1:46:28] given as a Prohibition to
[1:46:31] sin are not a requirement to the B of
[1:46:34] the Holy
[1:46:36] Ghost but when you receive the Hool GH
[1:46:40] you again live Above the
[1:46:42] Law are you together with me yeah we've
[1:46:46] got some laws of the land Thou shalt not
[1:46:49] murder you don't wake up any morning
[1:46:53] and say heavenly father help me that I
[1:46:56] may not
[1:46:57] murder the bre on the inside of you
[1:47:01] makes you live above that
[1:47:03] law amen we have got the laws of the
[1:47:07] land we should not beit our wives it's a
[1:47:11] law about Family
[1:47:14] Violence but you don't wake up in the
[1:47:16] morning Heavenly Father help me today
[1:47:21] that I may not beat sister
[1:47:24] there's a problem with you because the
[1:47:27] grace on the inside of you helps you to
[1:47:29] live a
[1:47:31] b the law of the land that's how Grace
[1:47:35] works in your life Grace is not a
[1:47:38] weakness gra is God on the inside of you
[1:47:43] lifting you above the
[1:47:46] Lord amen amen so there was therefore no
[1:47:51] law that could bring
[1:47:53] life we are made
[1:47:56] righteous by the grace of
[1:47:59] Calvary it drives us and takes us into
[1:48:03] our
[1:48:04] promise are you together with me amen
[1:48:08] that's why
[1:48:09] Paul amen comes out here in Ephesians
[1:48:14] 1 amen and he says having made known
[1:48:19] unto
[1:48:21] us the mystery of his
[1:48:25] will according to his good
[1:48:28] pleasure which he has purposed in
[1:48:33] himself did you hear that somebody
[1:48:38] say having made
[1:48:41] known unto us the mystery of his
[1:48:44] will the mystery of the will of
[1:48:48] God the scripture says God makes it
[1:48:52] known
[1:48:53] you amen so God has a
[1:48:58] will for
[1:49:00] everybody and his desire is that you may
[1:49:04] know the will of God for your
[1:49:07] life and I've already told you the will
[1:49:10] of God is your
[1:49:14] will amen he makes his desire known to
[1:49:19] everybody Paul says Paul an apostle of
[1:49:25] Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:49:28] God it places him there the will of God
[1:49:32] placed him there God will always make
[1:49:35] his
[1:49:36] will known for his children and this
[1:49:39] will is God's desire for our
[1:49:43] lives and that's handed over to
[1:49:46] us as a valid will
[1:49:53] amen I want us to go to abah
[1:49:56] here we go to Genesis
[1:50:00] 12 do you love him this morning yes sir
[1:50:03] I love
[1:50:05] him now the Lord said unto
[1:50:11] Abraham get thee out of thy
[1:50:14] country and from thy
[1:50:17] Kindred and from thy father's house
[1:50:23] unto a
[1:50:24] land I'll show
[1:50:27] thee so now he says I
[1:50:31] will so he's making his perfect will
[1:50:37] no opening the
[1:50:40] path into Abraham's
[1:50:43] inheritance so in verse two he says I
[1:50:47] will make of the a great nation
[1:50:52] making
[1:50:54] known to Abraham the M of his
[1:50:58] will for his life and I will bless thee
[1:51:03] and make thy name
[1:51:05] great and thou shalt be a
[1:51:07] blessed and I will bless
[1:51:11] them that bless thee and C that CES
[1:51:16] thee and in this shall all the families
[1:51:19] of the earth be blessed
[1:51:23] so and in every
[1:51:27] will we have the
[1:51:32] details you don't just say I've given
[1:51:35] you my
[1:51:38] land on the
[1:51:41] hill there must be
[1:51:44] details of the plot
[1:51:47] number because you could be
[1:51:50] in but you are not the only one there
[1:51:54] there are sever many people you can be a
[1:51:58] pastor but you are not the only Pastor
[1:52:02] there are several pastors when God
[1:52:04] anoints other
[1:52:06] Pastor is different from another
[1:52:09] Pastor oh hallelujah hallelujah there is
[1:52:12] a way
[1:52:14] God anoints
[1:52:16] us
[1:52:18] specifically for a particular purpose
[1:52:25] God makes you a song
[1:52:27] leader He blesses you a different way
[1:52:31] makes
[1:52:34] another that's
[1:52:39] God I want us to understand that so he
[1:52:45] defines he makes you know the world plan
[1:52:51] known and in this
[1:52:53] inheritance it is exactly like when you
[1:52:56] are going to get into
[1:52:59] it it's living one day at a
[1:53:02] time so let me say this every one of us
[1:53:08] is on pass to that
[1:53:13] inheritance if you were
[1:53:18] there even then you live in the
[1:53:21] inheritance
[1:53:23] one day at a
[1:53:26] time so it's constant
[1:53:30] obedience is working in the will of
[1:53:34] God that is your
[1:53:36] adoption staying in the
[1:53:39] presence and subject to the
[1:53:43] presence are you together with me oh
[1:53:47] praise the Lord Abraham get up begin the
[1:53:53] Journey I'm taking you to a
[1:53:56] land that you've never known
[1:53:59] before and Adam Rises and Abraham
[1:54:03] Rises and he
[1:54:05] walks according to the will of
[1:54:08] God the will of God works him into his
[1:54:15] will so before going into detail with
[1:54:19] Abraham let us Branch a little bit
[1:54:24] and he go into Moses and then theal
[1:54:30] son you see the whole
[1:54:34] thing is that our
[1:54:38] inheritance our spiritual
[1:54:41] inheritance is not something we are
[1:54:43] working
[1:54:46] for it was given to us before the
[1:54:50] foundation of the world
[1:54:52] what God desires of us to exact that
[1:54:59] will in that
[1:55:01] inheritance is
[1:55:04] obedience that's all when you walk in
[1:55:08] obedience you are working in the will of
[1:55:11] God and the will of God is a will for
[1:55:17] you so when you lose the will of God
[1:55:22] your life you are walking away from your
[1:55:26] will so every day as we walk in the Lord
[1:55:32] we are walking in the will of
[1:55:35] God to fulfill his will for
[1:55:40] us amen inheritance is a very
[1:55:43] interesting
[1:55:45] one but we shall get there look at the
[1:55:48] book of
[1:55:50] Exodus 3:7
[1:55:54] and the Lord
[1:55:55] said I have surely seen the Affliction
[1:55:57] of my
[1:55:59] people which are in Egypt and have heard
[1:56:03] their
[1:56:04] Cry by reason of their task Masters for
[1:56:08] I know their
[1:56:09] sorrows and I am
[1:56:12] come down to deliver
[1:56:15] them out of the land of the
[1:56:18] Egyptians and in to bring them up
[1:56:22] out of a land a good
[1:56:28] land
[1:56:30] and at a land flowing with milk and
[1:56:34] honey
[1:56:36] verse
[1:56:37] now therefore Behold The Cry of the
[1:56:41] children of Israel come unto
[1:56:44] me and I have come and I've also seen
[1:56:48] the oppression where we the Egyptians
[1:56:50] oppress them
[1:57:01] and I'll send thee unto
[1:57:04] Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my
[1:57:10] children out of
[1:57:12] Egypt so
[1:57:15] Moses was not
[1:57:17] told all the
[1:57:21] details amen of the
[1:57:24] commission but what God
[1:57:26] required was commission I mean was was
[1:57:31] submission just subit
[1:57:34] yourself now my
[1:57:38] will my desire for
[1:57:42] you Moses is that you become a
[1:57:45] delivering
[1:57:48] Prophet that's the anointing that will
[1:57:51] be upon you
[1:57:54] that's your
[1:57:57] inheritance are you together with me yes
[1:58:00] so now Moses would begin to
[1:58:04] walk under that
[1:58:07] anointing is fulfilling the will of
[1:58:11] God therefore the will of
[1:58:14] God
[1:58:17] is the
[1:58:18] will of God for him
[1:58:25] simple we want to get into an
[1:58:29] inheritance and then we begin to pray
[1:58:32] Heavenly Father help me Heavenly Father
[1:58:34] help me he help you but you
[1:58:38] disobey the will of
[1:58:45] God is your
[1:58:49] will is your inheritance
[1:58:52] just
[1:58:53] obey God says go left go left go right
[1:58:57] you go right so Moses took his
[1:59:00] two and ventured into the desire of
[1:59:04] God which in turn was his
[1:59:08] will amen God's tested for
[1:59:12] him so in the
[1:59:14] tested what belongs to the testator is
[1:59:18] now yours
[1:59:23] amen the testator
[1:59:25] says I have given
[1:59:28] you and you
[1:59:30] own it's yours nobody can challenge the
[1:59:36] ownership so the
[1:59:40] testator gives a
[1:59:42] portion of his wealth to
[1:59:45] you are you together with me he gives it
[1:59:49] to
[1:59:49] you so you are now a
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:54] possessor come now therefore and I send
[1:59:58] you to
[1:59:59] Pharaoh are you together with me I am
[2:00:03] come
[2:00:04] down amen praise the Lord I am come down
[2:00:10] to deliver them out of the hand of the
[2:00:15] Egyptians is saying I have come
[2:00:18] down but now
[2:00:20] Moses I'm giving a
[2:00:23] portion of my
[2:00:26] Ministry is going to be your
[2:00:28] inheritance come now Moses and I make
[2:00:32] you a
[2:00:36] deliverer praise the Lord I am the
[2:00:40] deliverer but
[2:00:42] Moses I will to
[2:00:46] you amen my
[2:00:48] power I will to you
[2:00:52] Authority go and bring the people out I
[2:00:56] Le you the creative
[2:00:59] Authority amen mes would say let
[2:01:04] be come God L him a portion of
[2:01:10] himself hallelujah hallelujah and once
[2:01:13] you are adopted as a Son of
[2:01:16] God position in
[2:01:19] Christ God will portion of his authority
[2:01:24] of his of his glory to
[2:01:30] you this is my son in whom I am well
[2:01:36] pleased here
[2:01:38] him amen because when he speaks is as
[2:01:43] God speaking I make you like a God and
[2:01:48] shall be
[2:01:49] your hallelujah hallelujah finding a
[2:01:52] position in
[2:01:54] Christ is God trusting you and giving
[2:01:59] you some of his authority to do his
[2:02:04] [Applause]
[2:02:05] will praise the
[2:02:08] Lord ah do you love him
[2:02:11] Aon amen you know shall be your
[2:02:16] Prophet so when Moses
[2:02:18] spoke it was as God has spoken
[2:02:23] and then Aon
[2:02:25] ran and said what Moses
[2:02:28] said God
[2:02:30] fulfilled we have had a prophet in this
[2:02:33] AG he has prophesied
[2:02:36] everything for us to know in this age
[2:02:39] but Revelation
[2:02:41] 10:7 he says Thou must
[2:02:45] prophesy amen who will prophesy again we
[2:02:50] handle the word of Prophecy
[2:02:52] and we prophesy again that's finding
[2:02:55] your position in the
[2:02:57] body and does not mean that you are not
[2:03:00] going to have
[2:03:02] challenges they may be so many but God
[2:03:05] will always stand on your
[2:03:07] side Moses had the
[2:03:10] challenges but once you are
[2:03:12] positioned and S of God God will always
[2:03:16] be at your side as you deal with the
[2:03:19] challenges of life
[2:03:23] amen praise the Lord the
[2:03:27] challenges and now God constantly made
[2:03:30] Away by
[2:03:34] submission amen so we read Hebrews
[2:03:37] chapter 10 verse
[2:03:39] 7 and he says then said
[2:03:43] I lo I
[2:03:46] can in the book of the in the volume of
[2:03:49] the book written of me
[2:03:53] to doy
[2:03:55] will that's the way God
[2:03:58] works
[2:04:01] God before Christ
[2:04:05] came and when Christ came he says now
[2:04:09] those people were
[2:04:11] testing of what Christ was going to
[2:04:15] be are you together with me and if we
[2:04:18] are a
[2:04:19] portion of that word
[2:04:23] we are also in the volume of the
[2:04:29] book we shall find that
[2:04:32] out in his
[2:04:35] adoption Christ had to submit the will
[2:04:38] of the
[2:04:40] father I come in the volume of the
[2:04:43] book meaning that I don't want to set my
[2:04:49] foot away from what is written of
[2:04:54] me if I'm setting my foot
[2:04:58] here it should have been
[2:05:01] written that my foot will be
[2:05:04] there if I'm taking this
[2:05:07] CA it must be written that out take that
[2:05:12] cause my will amen is
[2:05:16] always underwritten or is always checked
[2:05:20] out by the written word
[2:05:24] you don't come up
[2:05:26] here the God has called
[2:05:29] me and then you start writing or doing
[2:05:33] something which is not in the word
[2:05:37] because when Jesus came he came in the
[2:05:40] volume of the
[2:05:41] book If God sends a man he sends him in
[2:05:45] the volume of the book when God anoints
[2:05:48] you he anoints you in the volume of the
[2:05:51] book so where is your position in the if
[2:05:55] you stand in your
[2:05:57] volume then God will back you
[2:06:01] up amen God Amen so you know it's Christ
[2:06:07] in the king is Christ in the prophets is
[2:06:11] Christ in the holy
[2:06:14] man so when Jesus came he saw himself in
[2:06:20] the volume of the book
[2:06:23] you would go back into the
[2:06:25] prophets and look at his
[2:06:28] path so he came in the volume of the
[2:06:32] book and I want to set this afternoon
[2:06:37] also that our
[2:06:41] inheritance is hidden in the volume of
[2:06:43] the book
[2:06:45] also he promises in the
[2:06:49] word so by Looking Back back into the
[2:06:53] scripture we can find out who we
[2:06:56] are we can know God's
[2:07:00] will in his you know in this season for
[2:07:05] us let's go down to
[2:07:08] firster maybe we can understand it
[2:07:14] better verse
[2:07:19] 9 receiving the end of your
[2:07:22] Faith even the salvation of your
[2:07:32] souls the end of your
[2:07:35] faith is the Salvation of your
[2:07:37] soul that's the
[2:07:39] purpose of which salvation the prophets
[2:07:42] have inquired and searched d
[2:07:55] who prophesied of the grace that should
[2:07:58] come after
[2:08:03] you are you together with me the
[2:08:06] prophets already
[2:08:10] prophesy concerning the grace that was
[2:08:12] coming unto
[2:08:15] you amen they wrote the book of our in
[2:08:21] praise God verse 11 searching what what
[2:08:25] manner of
[2:08:29] time the spirit of Christ which was in
[2:08:33] them did
[2:08:37] signify how it testified before the
[2:08:40] sufferings of Christ and the glory that
[2:08:43] should
[2:08:48] follow so the The Works of the
[2:08:52] prophets testified
[2:08:55] beforehand and mapped out the path of
[2:08:58] the ministry of the Lord Jesus
[2:09:02] Christ so Christ came to step into his
[2:09:08] adoption to step into his
[2:09:11] place and buy the same
[2:09:15] token you and
[2:09:17] I come to step into predestin form of
[2:09:24] service hallelujah hallelujah because it
[2:09:27] was
[2:09:28] predestinated for us before the
[2:09:31] foundation of the world like a Christ
[2:09:34] came and stepped into the
[2:09:37] map into the past of his life and he
[2:09:42] said this point
[2:09:44] here when Jeremiah said this point here
[2:09:49] is when Isaiah said this point here is
[2:09:53] when eel
[2:09:54] say you your
[2:09:58] points your sports in your
[2:10:01] journey that
[2:10:03] individ is already mapped in the
[2:10:07] work hallelujah hallelujah praise
[2:10:11] God Amen so in verse 12 what happens
[2:10:16] here
[2:10:18] maybe I can say that we grow into our
[2:10:23] so we have also the volume of
[2:10:26] book that has gone before
[2:10:29] us and when Paul read that
[2:10:32] book he called us written
[2:10:36] Epistles of all men you become the
[2:10:41] work amen to express the will of
[2:10:45] God are you together with me verse
[2:10:49] 12 he says to was
[2:10:52] revealed that not unto
[2:10:58] themselves he's talking about the
[2:11:01] prophets but unto
[2:11:04] us the prophets unto
[2:11:07] us amen they did Minister the
[2:11:12] things which are now reported unto
[2:11:17] you by them that had preached the gospel
[2:11:20] unto you
[2:11:23] with the holy
[2:11:25] ghost from
[2:11:28] Heaven which things the Angels desire to
[2:11:31] look
[2:11:33] into so as the prophets also
[2:11:38] preached they were preaching unto
[2:11:43] you because it
[2:11:46] says as they
[2:11:49] preached the things which and now
[2:11:52] preached unto
[2:11:55] you so now these things we preach to
[2:11:59] you we pick them from the sayings of the
[2:12:05] prophets so God saw
[2:12:08] you he saw you in this
[2:12:11] season hallelujah hallelujah it was not
[2:12:15] in the days of
[2:12:16] Noah it is in this
[2:12:19] season where God saw
[2:12:22] and when God spoke about you he wanted
[2:12:25] you to come forth
[2:12:27] now because this is where your position
[2:12:32] is it's not in the days of
[2:12:35] Moses it is now so I want to tell you my
[2:12:41] brother God is not a
[2:12:44] man a man testes before he
[2:12:48] di but godes
[2:12:51] before he gives
[2:12:55] birth so we come here to
[2:12:58] step into the
[2:13:01] position which God has ordained for
[2:13:04] us so
[2:13:06] God Minister down to
[2:13:09] us the book of volumes of our
[2:13:14] inheritance prophets and the
[2:13:19] apostles let's go to Ephesians
[2:13:24] 1
[2:13:28] 1 he says in whom
[2:13:32] Soul we have obtained an
[2:13:37] inheritance in
[2:13:40] who in
[2:13:41] Christ being predestinated according to
[2:13:44] the purpose of him who workes all things
[2:13:48] after the Cel of his own will
[2:13:58] so you are in
[2:14:01] Christ your inheritance is
[2:14:06] guaranteed amen once you are in
[2:14:11] Christ your
[2:14:13] inheritance is
[2:14:16] guaranteed in whom also we have obtained
[2:14:21] an
[2:14:22] inheritance and he gave
[2:14:24] some Apostles some
[2:14:37] prophets Hallelujah so our
[2:14:40] [Applause]
[2:14:42] inheritance is not the
[2:14:46] [Music]
[2:14:48] same amen
[2:14:51] then he says whether
[2:14:53] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[2:14:56] the proportion of
[2:14:59] Faith amen everybody in a gift which God
[2:15:03] gives

[2:21:26] amen keeping your own
[2:21:30] calling amen
[2:21:33] adoption is in
[2:21:35] him and that's in the volume of the
[2:21:45] book that's what verse 11 said Ephesians
[2:21:49] 1 in whom also we have obtained an
[2:21:55] inheritance outside of
[2:21:58] him there's no
[2:22:00] inheritance but in
[2:22:04] him we have obtained an
[2:22:09] inheritance out a little
[2:22:12] bit you know when you out of the
[2:22:17] Border you lose the signals of the guide
[2:22:22] you know it's just like this the
[2:22:27] form it's gazed to
[2:22:31] work
[2:22:35] range if you go out of the
[2:22:38] rench you lose the
[2:22:41] signals yeah
[2:22:44] hello I'm not hearing very well
[2:22:51] Al you lose the
[2:22:53] signal you don't hear from the
[2:22:55] [Laughter]
[2:22:58] father and yet
[2:23:01] adoption works by constant
[2:23:07] submission hallelujah hallelujah you
[2:23:09] have gone here there is a challenge
[2:23:13] Moses goes back to the father God gives
[2:23:16] him more
[2:23:17] instruction again he goes forward
[2:23:20] challenge he goes back to the father
[2:23:24] that's how God works with he'll never
[2:23:26] give you everything you have need of God
[2:23:30] wants to walk with you one day at a
[2:23:36] time amen listen here the prophet says
[2:23:41] how was our inheritance given to
[2:23:44] us through what
[2:23:48] predestination predestination is for
[2:23:51] knowled how did God know he could trust
[2:23:55] you to be a
[2:23:57] preacher his for knowledge not that
[2:24:03] will or he that
[2:24:05] run God that showeth
[2:24:08] Mercy that's right
[2:24:11] predestination he knew what was in
[2:24:14] you he knowed what was in you before the
[2:24:17] foundation of the Earth
[2:24:20] he know that was in you before there was
[2:24:23] even on
[2:24:25] Earth that's the infinite
[2:24:29] God Amen we
[2:24:33] are we can only
[2:24:38] think that's the infinite
[2:24:41] God away from
[2:24:43] him you detach yourself from The
[2:24:47] Inheritance because in him
[2:24:51] only when in
[2:24:53] him when you step out you lose the
[2:24:59] signal so our
[2:25:02] inheritance is a daily
[2:25:12] submission of
[2:25:16] the Christ was talking to the Jews
[2:25:20] who understood the principle of The
[2:25:22] Bling of a
[2:25:26] son praise the Lord because they
[2:25:30] knew that a son to bet
[2:25:33] trayed and be brought to understanding
[2:25:37] the trade of his
[2:25:40] father so that he can be able to make
[2:25:43] right
[2:25:45] judgments over the father's business
[2:25:50] therefore this prodal son had gone
[2:25:54] through the entire
[2:25:58] process and when he asked for what
[2:26:00] belonged to
[2:26:02] him so that he could go into a far
[2:26:05] country and exercises
[2:26:09] adoption the father gave him to prove
[2:26:14] him there are certain times we do things
[2:26:18] to teach people
[2:26:20] you let them do that they may learn from
[2:26:24] the
[2:26:25] experience the father was a very
[2:26:27] experience
[2:26:29] man so he says this boy
[2:26:32] wants I will give him I want to prove
[2:26:36] him but without me you can do
[2:26:41] nothing that's
[2:26:43] adoption without me you can do nothing
[2:26:48] so the father allows you
[2:26:52] sometimes amen and he allows you to
[2:26:55] go knowing he has got the
[2:26:58] ability to bring you
[2:27:02] back praise the Lord so that you may
[2:27:06] learn my
[2:27:09] experience that's why there's the
[2:27:12] principle of the good sheer who goes
[2:27:16] after the Lost
[2:27:18] ship are you together with
[2:27:20] he you a little
[2:27:23] bit you were so much
[2:27:26] anxious you desire you go beyond the
[2:27:30] borders God will let you go that you may
[2:27:33] learn by experence he allowed the prodal
[2:27:37] side he gave him what belonged to him
[2:27:41] and he went into a far country went
[2:27:45] further the borders and when he lost the
[2:27:48] signal
[2:27:50] wouldn't manag the F
[2:27:54] anymore are you together with me the boy
[2:27:59] knew one thing he was
[2:28:01] smart is that he had an
[2:28:07] inheritance that was a very great
[2:28:11] Revelation that I have an
[2:28:15] inheritance but how you manage the
[2:28:18] inheritance
[2:28:20] is another
[2:28:23] question but he knew he had an
[2:28:27] inheritance and when the father gave him
[2:28:31] he went and messed it
[2:28:33] up why because he went beyond the
[2:28:37] Border when God commits his
[2:28:41] inheritance you you must
[2:28:45] stay in the father's
[2:28:48] will because the father's will is your
[2:28:53] [Applause]
[2:28:56] will praise the
[2:28:58] Lord
[2:29:00] adoption is continuing in submission to
[2:29:05] father look at this adoption
[2:29:09] here I mean
[2:29:11] Abraham is going out of the natural
[2:29:16] life he called all his children
[2:29:21] those that He with
[2:29:23] KRA and
[2:29:25] is and gave them
[2:29:28] gifts but Abraham but Isaac remained
[2:29:32] with him as hair of all
[2:29:36] things are you together with me the
[2:29:44] gifts sometimes without
[2:29:48] him you miss mismanage
[2:29:51] them you mismanage
[2:29:54] them but he said I want is
[2:29:59] here don't go away I want you to
[2:30:04] stay under
[2:30:06] submission for the management of all
[2:30:09] this
[2:30:13] estate are you together with
[2:30:17] me adoption
[2:30:20] is
[2:30:22] Solomon anointed as
[2:30:25] king before his father was
[2:30:28] dead so the will of the
[2:30:30] father is different from our natural
[2:30:34] will because our natural
[2:30:37] will involves
[2:30:40] death but the will of
[2:30:43] God only requires
[2:30:47] submission to his presence
[2:30:51] know your
[2:30:52] borders remain humble to
[2:30:55] him that is
[2:30:57] stability amen because our
[2:31:03] inheritance is called
[2:31:08] haip are you together with me we
[2:31:12] learn that it
[2:31:16] was when
[2:31:18] Isaac remained with this father and his
[2:31:22] took the
[2:31:23] gift we know it was
[2:31:26] C when Israel cried out and said God
[2:31:31] Save the King God Save the
[2:31:34] King was going on his father's
[2:31:39] M and David was still alive we know it
[2:31:44] is God trusts us with positions in the
[2:31:51] [Music]
[2:31:53] but we
[2:31:55] must understand our
[2:31:57] B my father is
[2:32:00] rich in houses and
[2:32:03] land that's what the scripture says not
[2:32:07] will be
[2:32:09] rich but he is
[2:32:11] Rich he holds our inheritance in his own
[2:32:17] hands amen amen so our land of
[2:32:22] adoption is
[2:32:24] predestinated but you must
[2:32:28] win the battles of
[2:32:32] character in order to remain in your
[2:32:39] inheritance child
[2:32:43] training amen like Israel needed child
[2:32:47] training
[2:32:51] across the Red
[2:32:53] Sea across the
[2:32:56] Wilderness across the
[2:32:58] Jordan and the battles of
[2:33:02] possession so we need also our
[2:33:06] training to win the
[2:33:10] battles in your child
[2:33:13] training
[2:33:15] justification
[2:33:17] sanctification then the bapm with his
[2:33:19] own life
[2:33:21] that's the way God prepares us to go
[2:33:25] into our
[2:33:29] inheritance in some of us studing the
[2:33:33] Galatians yesterday morning we were
[2:33:37] looking at a
[2:33:40] child when he born a
[2:33:44] child much as his of all
[2:33:47] things he's not better than than a
[2:33:51] servant until he has been
[2:33:55] trained through child
[2:33:58] training am I a child of God yes you are
[2:34:04] what is my possession I know what it
[2:34:07] is just be patient with
[2:34:10] God is taking you through the
[2:34:14] process to possess your
[2:34:17] inheritance let's get a little bit
[2:34:21] um do you give me some 30
[2:34:24] minutes amen keep looking at your
[2:34:28] watch I don't want to be like brother
[2:34:32] Tim who says do you give me some five
[2:34:35] minutes how many people give me five
[2:34:38] minutes then he counted about
[2:34:41] 200 then he says okay
[2:34:47] time so uh
[2:34:51] ification all of us we
[2:34:54] start the Journey of
[2:34:58] cleansing of
[2:35:00] character through
[2:35:02] justification let's go to I mean Romans
[2:35:06] chapter verse 1 and
[2:35:09] two therefore being justified by
[2:35:15] faith we have peace with God through our
[2:35:18] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:35:22] by whom also we have access by
[2:35:28] faith into this gra weing we
[2:35:33] stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory
[2:35:36] of
[2:35:39] God justification by
[2:35:44] faith that gave you peace with
[2:35:48] God and open the
[2:35:51] door into the grace wherein you
[2:35:56] stand amen
[2:35:59] justification what is
[2:36:01] justification is God Beginning to Look
[2:36:04] At
[2:36:05] You different from what he looked at
[2:36:09] you before you repented your
[2:36:12] past but when you repent your
[2:36:15] past then you are
[2:36:17] Justified and the priesthood this
[2:36:21] Grace where you stand is not the one of
[2:36:26] Aon it's the priesthood
[2:36:31] of in his
[2:36:33] priesthood Hallelujah hallu he's the
[2:36:37] [Music]
[2:36:39] Creator but Aon could not
[2:36:43] create but God
[2:36:46] himself the priesthood in this place
[2:36:48] where we
[2:36:51] he becomes the
[2:36:53] Creator he only he
[2:36:56] alone can bring
[2:36:59] conviction to any man and the
[2:37:03] justification is the work of the Holy
[2:37:06] Ghost and once he comes to work in your
[2:37:10] life he
[2:37:12] creates you into new
[2:37:15] man there's there no condemnation
[2:37:19] that in Christ and new creatures is the
[2:37:24] priesthood of
[2:37:26] Grace the
[2:37:29] pr that has created you into a new
[2:37:37] man amen now after
[2:37:42] justification he was still being tuted
[2:37:45] into
[2:37:46] character you are taken into your
[2:37:52] sanctification John
[2:37:55] 1717 sanctify them through th
[2:37:58] truth word is
[2:38:00] trth the word is our only means of
[2:38:07] sanctification there's no other way my
[2:38:11] laws will not
[2:38:14] JY my L they become just some kind of
[2:38:19] traditions of
[2:38:24] aner it's obedience to a
[2:38:27] man it doesn't change you but the
[2:38:31] world is what will change
[2:38:34] you as we
[2:38:36] hear believe and perform that word then
[2:38:41] we are
[2:38:41] [Music]
[2:38:45] Sanctified are you together with me let
[2:38:48] me tell you
[2:38:51] the
[2:38:52] Galatians were better than some of our
[2:38:55] people
[2:38:59] today the
[2:39:01] Galatians held on the
[2:39:03] law which came from Moses god to Moses
[2:39:09] but
[2:39:10] today what people call
[2:39:13] law in our
[2:39:15] churches is even has nothing to do with
[2:39:18] God
[2:39:20] it's not even the
[2:39:22] law it's the traditions of the
[2:39:26] elders how can you say you've got the
[2:39:29] Holy
[2:39:30] Ghost when you come to church
[2:39:33] late everybody comes very
[2:39:36] early how can you say you have the Holy
[2:39:39] Ghost when you miss two services in a
[2:39:42] week everybody comes to the
[2:39:45] services that will not help you
[2:39:49] want God to convict your
[2:39:53] life by the
[2:39:57] word that's what brings the B of
[2:40:03] the when
[2:40:07] God has reached your
[2:40:11] life by sanctification of your
[2:40:16] spirit it makes you a new creature
[2:40:23] but you know there is a nature human
[2:40:29] nature when
[2:40:31] something they had nothing to eat in the
[2:40:34] wild and then God would give them
[2:40:37] money and they still said we are tired
[2:40:40] of this
[2:40:42] bread now what will you eat
[2:40:50] that's human nature as long as nature is
[2:40:53] not
[2:40:56] converted it will get tired of
[2:40:59] everything amen it will get tired of
[2:41:03] everything when the pastor
[2:41:05] begins to bring these lessons on your
[2:41:12] phon other
[2:41:15] things that's an unconverted nature what
[2:41:18] can we do
[2:41:23] you know
[2:41:25] have they think we also what can we do
[2:41:29] that's
[2:41:31] human but as a minister you continue you
[2:41:35] may be helping one or
[2:41:42] two you see you never take wisdom from a
[2:41:48] man I did my
[2:41:54] posting I tell you I tell you but that's
[2:41:57] the nature of a
[2:41:58] man the traditions of the
[2:42:01] elders have nothing to do with our
[2:42:04] sanctification sanctification is a work
[2:42:07] of
[2:42:08] Grace that teaches the word into the
[2:42:12] soul of a man to make him a new
[2:42:17] creature amen ification is
[2:42:21] believing sanctification is the
[2:42:23] cleansing the Holy Ghost is the feeling
[2:42:25] of
[2:42:27] Life brother Bram
[2:42:30] says so after teaching them three and a
[2:42:33] half
[2:42:35] years he told them turn in
[2:42:38] Jerusalem till you be ued with
[2:42:42] life so justification is the work of the
[2:42:45] Holy
[2:42:47] Spirit sanctification is the work of the
[2:42:49] Holy
[2:42:50] Spirit but the
[2:42:53] baptism is the holy
[2:42:56] spirit statements of brother
[2:42:59] BR so it is the character of
[2:43:02] Christ that will bring us to the
[2:43:05] predestinated
[2:43:08] purpose to the
[2:43:10] world to do thy will
[2:43:15] God are you together with me that's what
[2:43:18] we should be saying I come to do to the
[2:43:21] world to do thy will oh God if we suffer
[2:43:26] with
[2:43:27] him with him suffering with him is a
[2:43:31] cause to
[2:43:32] adoption he did not suffer because he
[2:43:34] was a
[2:43:35] sinner rather because it was necessary
[2:43:39] to build
[2:43:41] character hallelujah hallelujah if he
[2:43:44] that was born
[2:43:47] sinless could be T to develop
[2:43:52] character how about
[2:43:56] us praise the Lord so I'll
[2:44:00] go to the doctrine of the testator here
[2:44:03] as I'm
[2:44:08] finishing amen when the testator
[2:44:12] dies the power of
[2:44:15] possession comes to the hair
[2:44:21] amen and I want you
[2:44:24] people to make your personal
[2:44:30] Wheels let me you a little
[2:44:34] bit without a
[2:44:36] will you can dilize the
[2:44:43] church because people take
[2:44:46] sight I'm the one who was with my dad
[2:44:49] most of the
[2:44:51] time were just there
[2:44:56] abroad make your personal
[2:45:02] Wheels amen amen s Luke
[2:45:09] 12 13
[2:45:12] 15 and one of the company said unto him
[2:45:16] master
[2:45:21] speak to my
[2:45:23] brother that heed The Inheritance with
[2:45:27] me he said unto
[2:45:30] him who made me a judge or divider over
[2:45:38] you they come to
[2:45:42] [Music]
[2:45:44] the now Pastor I want you to reconcile
[2:45:47] us
[2:45:49] our father died without a
[2:45:53] will now this
[2:45:56] one big
[2:45:58] house this small one for
[2:46:02] us and Jesus says yes who has made me a
[2:46:08] judge or a divider over
[2:46:12] you go and make your wheels
[2:46:20] and he said unto
[2:46:22] them take heed and beware
[2:46:27] ofous man's life consist not in the
[2:46:30] abess of the things he
[2:46:35] has so I want to say here that God's
[2:46:41] children Must Die
[2:46:45] Tate we must make our will
[2:46:49] to help in church
[2:46:51] stability because it always comes back
[2:46:56] here when we started out were
[2:47:02] boys 40 plus years 45 4 years
[2:47:08] ago amen no thought about
[2:47:13] death but many of us have beg to live
[2:47:19] dying intested shows a lack of love for
[2:47:22] your
[2:47:26] family and it destabilizes the
[2:47:29] church we should not
[2:47:32] get in cornered into walls of
[2:47:38] inheritance God's love put him forth
[2:47:42] according to the volume of the
[2:47:44] book it pleased God
[2:47:50] so let's look at the mystery of his will
[2:47:54] here and then we shall go to Jeremiah
[2:47:56] and
[2:47:58] finish amen Jeremiah said much as I'm
[2:48:02] buying from my
[2:48:05] cousin and I'm going to die maybe I not
[2:48:09] live 70
[2:48:13] years I need the Testament here
[2:48:20] so the Myster of God's will for
[2:48:23] you is
[2:48:25] hidden and then revealed in the
[2:48:29] word in the word is where we find the
[2:48:33] revelation of who we
[2:48:35] are the will of your
[2:48:40] inheritance the will of your
[2:48:43] inheritance is in the word in the
[2:48:46] adoption message
[2:48:49] part
[2:48:50] four brother Ephesians
[2:48:56] 1 and he says having made known unto us
[2:48:59] the mster of his
[2:49:02] will according to his good
[2:49:05] pleasure which he has purposed in
[2:49:12] himself yes sir then after reading this
[2:49:17] scripture brother says this
[2:49:20] words and each man has to seek out the
[2:49:24] will of
[2:49:27] God for his
[2:49:30] or
[2:49:34] God's every one of us has to seek out
[2:49:39] the will of
[2:49:41] God for himself
[2:49:43] for how do we find
[2:49:46] out Paul it was known to him he said he
[2:49:51] didn't confer with any
[2:49:54] man no Flesh and Blood he went to no
[2:49:59] school no
[2:50:01] Seminary he had nothing to do with it it
[2:50:05] was revealed to him by Jesus Christ who
[2:50:09] met him on the road to
[2:50:11] Damascus in a light like a pill of
[2:50:15] fire and called him and went to Arabia
[2:50:20] and there DW three
[2:50:23] years oh three years Paul was down there
[2:50:28] in
[2:50:30] Arabia rented him a little building
[2:50:33] somewhere walking up and down the floor
[2:50:37] with old Scrolls in his
[2:50:40] hand amen he was in a little
[2:50:44] room he was in the
[2:50:47] scoss that's how found it out he would
[2:50:51] pounce back and forth when sleep was
[2:50:54] about to take him then he would put that
[2:50:57] scroll down he would pick up another one
[2:51:02] because Paul knew that the will of God
[2:51:06] every
[2:51:07] individual was written in the
[2:51:11] book
[2:51:12] Hallelujah It Was Written In the
[2:51:15] book upon you his will was
[2:51:21] detriment in the world and that's where
[2:51:24] the
[2:51:25] will that defines you
[2:51:29] individually is hidden
[2:51:31] also hidden in the world when you feed
[2:51:35] on the word you'll be able to know who
[2:51:37] you are when you say the word you will
[2:51:41] find
[2:51:42] sections of the will of
[2:51:45] God that pertains to you
[2:51:52] amen so the
[2:51:54] inheritance is hidden in
[2:51:59] vessels which vessels you
[2:52:03] are Hallelujah and you study the word
[2:52:07] from the
[2:52:08] inside you study from the level of
[2:52:14] revelation the Holy Spirit Will sh
[2:52:19] some
[2:52:20] lights upon certain hidden areas of the
[2:52:26] world that
[2:52:28] you that is
[2:52:31] me that is me because you are standing
[2:52:36] before the
[2:52:38] mirror of God's
[2:52:40] word
[2:52:42] you you don't
[2:52:45] read you study
[2:52:52] uh-uh you don't just read like a man
[2:52:55] reading a new
[2:52:57] paper you
[2:52:59] [Applause]
[2:53:02] there we call it feeding from
[2:53:07] the you feed from the clet of your
[2:53:12] soul because the fresh man was kept in
[2:53:15] the holy of holies
[2:53:19] so you
[2:53:20] withdraw you
[2:53:24] withdraw from the
[2:53:27] public into the closet of your
[2:53:31] soul to be able to
[2:53:34] study yourself into an
[2:53:39] inheritance that's what
[2:53:41] did with
[2:53:44] himself amen into closet
[2:53:48] Amen in
[2:53:49] Arabia and he s himself into the volume
[2:53:53] how many of you will seink in the volume
[2:53:55] of
[2:53:56] the amen you pick the Bible and stud
[2:54:01] take the tpes and hear them take the
[2:54:04] books and read them and you are going to
[2:54:07] say now I see why brother Steven says
[2:54:11] the things he
[2:54:14] say many people say where do you get
[2:54:17] these things from
[2:54:19] they are in the world you have to stand
[2:54:22] them they give you an inheritance they
[2:54:26] give you a change of
[2:54:28] Direction amen you allow God to speak to
[2:54:32] yourself oh praise
[2:54:35] God yes sir the volume of the
[2:54:42] book amen now let's look at Jeremiah and
[2:54:46] H here
[2:54:49] God told
[2:54:51] Jeremiah that
[2:54:54] cin would come to him that he could
[2:54:58] redeem his
[2:55:00] land because the rights of
[2:55:04] redemption was in
[2:55:07] Jeremiah's and
[2:55:09] Jeremiah b the
[2:55:11] land Amen on the
[2:55:15] strength that houses and Fields
[2:55:21] and
[2:55:22] vineard shall be possessed again in the
[2:55:26] land Hallelujah hallu hous and
[2:55:30] vineard shall be possessed
[2:55:35] again but Israel was going into
[2:55:38] captivity was going to
[2:55:41] chasti knew that once a son always a son
[2:55:48] do you hear what I
[2:55:49] say but you can feel a little bit of
[2:55:52] weakness a little bit of failure in your
[2:55:55] life and then you start saying I think
[2:55:58] I'm not unelect but Jeremiah says again
[2:56:03] in this land hous and lands shall be
[2:56:08] possessed Amen Let The Devil not sit on
[2:56:11] you permanently once you were a child of
[2:56:15] God you were known before the foundation
[2:56:17] of the
[2:56:20] you can be weak but that's for a while
[2:56:24] be like
[2:56:25] Jeremiah houses and lands shall be
[2:56:29] possessed today there will be a
[2:56:32] return in the land of
[2:56:36] possession
[2:56:38] amen so brother Bram uses this
[2:56:42] scenario to teach on Revelation 5 on the
[2:56:48] book which was written within and on the
[2:56:50] back side of the
[2:56:53] book but I also want to look at the
[2:56:57] angle where he uses it to
[2:57:02] describe where the documents were
[2:57:06] kept Amen brother Bram descries the
[2:57:11] documents but we want to dwell on where
[2:57:14] the document was
[2:57:17] kept hallelujah hallelujah it was not
[2:57:20] kept in Golden
[2:57:23] vessels it was kept in nothing
[2:57:27] vessels vessels represent you that was
[2:57:32] formed Out of the Dust of the
[2:57:35] Earth are you together with me brother
[2:57:38] Bram says and it was kept in Earthly
[2:57:42] [Music]
[2:57:44] vessel shows where the power of God
[2:57:48] and the
[2:57:49] Scrolls and the secrets of God is known
[2:57:53] in the
[2:57:54] heart our Plan of
[2:57:57] Redemption the same being kept in the
[2:58:00] earth Jesus name in our
[2:58:04] hearts amen and the Revelation so I want
[2:58:08] to tell you friends that there is
[2:58:11] something on the side of
[2:58:13] you hallelujah hallelujah once you take
[2:58:17] this book here
[2:58:19] and you studed
[2:58:21] it
[2:58:22] [Music]
[2:58:24] copy Hallelujah when you stand
[2:58:28] it it will Echo with something in
[2:58:35] the is something on side
[2:58:39] there will say
[2:58:42] yes
[2:58:44] yes yes and then something begins to
[2:58:49] change on the outside of you because the
[2:58:53] inside is aging on the outside the
[2:58:57] outside is agreeing on the inside the
[2:59:00] open copy and the closed copy say you
[2:59:04] are a son of
[2:59:05] God copy and the open copy encourage you
[2:59:10] to testify the copy and the close copy
[2:59:14] encourage you to pray you are
[2:59:18] completely in the will of God fulfilling
[2:59:23] the will of God your
[2:59:26] will is already
[2:59:30] written hallelujah hallelujah where is
[2:59:33] it
[2:59:34] kept on the inside of you God on your
[2:59:38] inside has kept sections of the w
[2:59:49] he has kept them on
[2:59:52] side and as he stud the word which is
[2:59:56] the open
[2:59:57] copy on the inside there there is
[3:00:01] something which
[3:00:02] jubilates that somebody is coming to the
[3:00:05] knowledge of the will of
[3:00:10] God Amen so we Retreat to the closet of
[3:00:15] our heart
[3:00:19] and that's what Paul
[3:00:21] did in the desert of
[3:00:24] Arabia in order reach his
[3:00:29] inheritance we have an eternal
[3:00:32] life through the grace of
[3:00:37] God so this treasure that we hold in
[3:00:40] this
[3:00:43] vers amen not put in there by man
[3:00:50] but by the power of the resurrection of
[3:00:53] God something is on the
[3:00:56] inside hallelujah hallelujah it was
[3:01:00] placed in the SE gen of
[3:01:03] God the foundation of the world and God
[3:01:08] has permanently kept it on the side
[3:01:11] of did you hear that you have something
[3:01:15] that identifies you as a Son of God in
[3:01:20] there is where God has kept your
[3:01:26] inheritance it's not something you going
[3:01:28] to look
[3:01:29] for it's something that's already on
[3:01:32] [Music]
[3:01:33] the but you discover Who You
[3:01:36] Are by going and staying into the
[3:01:41] word listen
[3:01:43] now he says in the of God
[3:01:48] kind of Glory manifests
[3:01:53] himself it brings forth the Word of
[3:01:57] Promise right out to you that's the
[3:02:01] reason that he had to Veil Moses's
[3:02:05] face because in him was the
[3:02:09] word he failed
[3:02:11] Jesus as a humble little
[3:02:14] man to keep them from seeing Jehovah
[3:02:19] and he veils himself
[3:02:23] today in the
[3:02:26] vessel with
[3:02:28] the outside looks like a bunch of
[3:02:35] rollers
[3:02:41] all
[3:02:44] skin but the inside
[3:02:48] hies
[3:02:50] the amen so what do I say as I
[3:02:57] finish the inside of you lays a
[3:03:01] mystery that God wants you to
[3:03:06] know he has made known unto
[3:03:12] us the mystery of his
[3:03:15] will so your
[3:03:19] will is already
[3:03:25] written where did God keep
[3:03:28] it in the volume of the
[3:03:30] book when Jesus came he went into the
[3:03:34] volume of the
[3:03:35] book and he knew he
[3:03:37] was when we come we need to go into the
[3:03:41] volume of the book identifies Who We
