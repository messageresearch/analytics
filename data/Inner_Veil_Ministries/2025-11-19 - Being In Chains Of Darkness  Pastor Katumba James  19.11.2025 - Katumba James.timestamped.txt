[11:09] Amen. Give him a praise of hands.

[11:22] [music]
[11:23] I shall not be I shall not
[11:28] [singing and music] be moved. Just like
[11:30] a tree
[11:32] that's planted by the water. [music]
[11:38] I shall lord. [music]
[11:43] I [singing] shall not be. I [music]
[11:47] shall not be.
[11:50] I shall [music]
[11:53] be. I shall be just like
[11:59] [music]
[12:00] mountain [singing] by the
[12:03] water.

[12:18] [music]
[12:23] [music]

[12:29] &gt;&gt; I
[12:34] [music]
[12:37] shall not.
[12:40] I shall go.
[12:44] I shall not be moved.
[12:49] I shall not be. I shall know him just
[12:56] like that.
[13:00] That's planted by the Lord.
[13:13] Amen. In the name of our Lord Jesus
[13:15] Christ.
[13:22] [applause]
[13:23] Amen.
[13:29] name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[13:58] and
[14:08] of our brother Williamover.
[14:45] Amen.
[14:56] need another mic.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; So let us turn to our Bibles
[15:07] in the book of second Peter chapter 2.
[15:13] Second Peter chapter 2 from verse one.
[15:21] The Bible says
[15:30] But there were false prophets also among
[15:33] the people, even as there shall be false
[15:36] teachers among you, who privately shall
[15:39] bring in damnable heresies, even denying
[15:42] the Lord that brought them that bought
[15:45] them, and bring upon themselves swift
[15:48] destruction.
[16:06] Monkeychech.
[16:22] And many shall follow their penicious
[16:24] ways by reason of whom the way of truth
[16:28] shall be evil spoken of.
[16:43] And through covetousness shall they with
[16:46] fain words make merchandise of you whose
[16:50] judgment now of a long time lingers not
[16:54] and their domination slumbers not.
[17:23] For if God spared not the angels that
[17:26] sinned, but cast them down to hell, and
[17:29] deliver them into chains of darkness, to
[17:32] be reserved unto to judgement.
[17:55] and spared not the old world, but saved
[17:58] Noah the eighth person, a preacher of
[18:01] righteousness, bringing in
[18:06] &gt;&gt; bring in the flood unto the world of the
[18:08] ungodly.
[18:36] and turning the cities of Sodom and
[18:38] Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them with
[18:41] an overthrow, making them an example
[18:44] unto those that after should live
[18:47] ungodly.
[19:04] and delivered just lot vexed with the
[19:06] filthy conversation of the wicked
[19:18] for that Righteous man dwelling among
[19:21] them in seeing and hearing vexed his
[19:24] righteous soul from day to day with
[19:27] unlawful deeds.
[19:48] The Lord knows how to deliver the
[19:50] ungodly. Rather, the Lord knows how to
[19:53] deliver the godly out of temptations and
[19:55] to reserve the unjust unto the day of
[19:58] judgment to be punished.
[20:14] May God bless you of his word. You may
[20:16] be.
[20:19] I want to draw our text from verse four.
[20:24] which says that for God spared not the
[20:27] angels that sinned
[20:32] but cast them to down to hell
[20:37] and deliver them into the chains of
[20:39] darkness
[20:43] to be reserved unto judgment.
[20:47] So I want to preach on being
[20:49] in the chains of darkness.
[20:59] Praise the name of the Lord. Being in
[21:02] chains of darkness.
[21:05] Praise the name of the Lord. And you
[21:08] know darkness itself
[21:11] is bondage.
[21:13] Praise the name of our Lord. We were
[21:15] born in sin
[21:18] and then you know shaped in iniquity.
[21:21] From
[21:23] our first birth,
[21:26] we are born into the kingdom of
[21:28] darkness.
[21:31] Praise the name of the Lord. You You
[21:33] come to the world desiring to do evil
[21:36] things.
[21:39] By nature, you are an enemy of God.
[21:44] You know the nature of the spirit,
[21:48] you know, which is the soul.
[21:51] is actually of darkness.
[21:54] When you are when you are born here on
[21:57] earth,
[21:58] &gt;&gt; you are rebellious with the things of
[22:00] God.
[22:02] You know before God, you are dead.
[22:06] You are living in darkness.
[22:11] Now in the book of Acts,
[22:14] the Lord was telling Paul
[22:17] to go and preach the gospel.
[22:21] And then in Acts chapter 26
[22:25] and then we go to verse 16.
[22:30] He says,
[22:31] &gt;&gt; "But rise and stand upon thy feet, for
[22:34] I've appeared unto thee for this
[22:36] purpose, to make you a minister and a
[22:39] witness of both these things which thou
[22:43] hast seen, and of those things in which
[22:46] I will appear unto thee.
[23:06] to delivering thee from the people and
[23:10] from the Gentiles and to whom now I send
[23:13] thee.
[23:24] to open their eyes and to turn them from
[23:27] darkness to light and from the power of
[23:30] Satan unto God, that they may receive
[23:33] forgiveness of sins and inheritance
[23:36] among them which are sanctified by faith
[23:39] that is in me.
[23:44] But
[23:53] you
[24:04] praise the name of our Lord. So it says
[24:07] that Paul
[24:09] is commissioned
[24:12] to go and preach the gospel of Jesus
[24:14] Christ
[24:16] so that the eyes of the people are
[24:19] opened.
[24:22] In other words, they come to the
[24:23] knowledge of the truth.
[24:26] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[24:28] they turn from darkness.
[24:32] You know the way of life.
[24:35] the things that they have, you know,
[24:37] believe in. If we can get another mic,
[24:41] praise the name of our Lord. So, he was
[24:43] telling them to open their eyes.
[24:47] They live the ways of Satan
[24:50] so that they can turn to God.
[24:54] So, our first bath puts us into the
[24:57] kingdom of darkness.
[25:00] Our first bath makes us to be enemies of
[25:04] God.
[25:06] Now when we hear the gospel of Jesus
[25:08] Christ,
[25:10] it opens our eyes,
[25:13] it makes us come to the realization
[25:18] you know that we are in sin. And now
[25:21] when you realize that you are in sin,
[25:24] then you repent of your sins, you turn
[25:28] away from the evil things and then you
[25:31] follow God. Praise the name of our Lord.
[25:34] And this is the desire of God
[25:38] that nobody should perish in sin.
[25:44] Nobody should perish in darkness.
[25:48] Now we see here in the Bible here the
[25:52] Bible has told us that there are some
[25:54] false prophets
[25:59] who privately or secretly come amongst
[26:02] us.
[26:05] You know they come in still
[26:09] you know you don't know and you don't
[26:11] realize that they are false
[26:14] and then they come amongst us.
[26:17] And then they start teaching things
[26:20] contrary
[26:22] to what we have believed.
[26:25] Now if you have known the truth,
[26:29] YOU CAME out of darkness
[26:32] and then you have come to the light.
[26:36] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[26:38] you walk in the light.
[26:40] like the children of Israel.
[26:43] THEY CAME OUT OF THE DARKNESS of Egypt
[26:48] and they were under the glory of God
[26:51] and they kept on following the
[26:52] leadership of Moses.
[26:55] them along the way.
[26:58] Like last
[27:00] we preached about the opposing spirits
[27:03] in the third exodus
[27:08] and we see the same thing which happens
[27:11] now
[27:13] that the Bible says that a mixed
[27:15] multitude came out of Egypt.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, THEY WERE NOT CONVERTED.
[27:25] You know there were people who came out.
[27:29] There are people who came out but then
[27:32] they could think about where they came
[27:34] from.
[27:36] Like people who leave the world and they
[27:39] come into salvation
[27:41] but they don't want to let go of the
[27:43] things of the world.
[27:46] They feel they are missing drinking.
[27:50] They feel they are missing nightclub.
[27:53] they feel they missing these kind of
[27:55] strange things.
[27:58] So they come out but they are not fully
[28:01] delivered from those things.
[28:04] And along the way they become a
[28:06] stumbling block.
[28:09] And so these people whose hearts have
[28:12] not been fully turned from evil,
[28:17] they are the ones who are easily
[28:19] deceived.
[28:22] They are the ones who are easily
[28:23] deceived.
[28:26] Praise the name of our Lord. Now the
[28:28] Bible has told us
[28:30] back here in first Peter chap 2 second
[28:33] Peter chapter 2,
[28:37] the Bible says
[28:39] that they bring in damnable heresies.
[28:47] 1 Peter 2 second Peter chapter 2 verse1
[28:57] you read it since you're not getting the
[28:58] right word.
[29:24] Now they come in privately
[29:28] and then they can start storytelling.
[29:32] The Bible says giving us fables.
[29:37] Like they were saying,
[29:40] we used to get satisfied in Egypt.
[29:46] We had graves in Egypt.
[29:49] But you see this place here, we are
[29:52] being wasted.
[29:55] They make THE PEOPLE FOCUS BACK TO THE
[29:57] things of the world.
[30:02] And last week we talked about Kora,
[30:06] you know, how he he was resisting the
[30:08] leadership of Moses
[30:12] Balam, how he was uniting the the the
[30:16] the children of Israel with the
[30:18] Moabites.
[30:21] And you know there are s spirits that
[30:23] come during the Exodus.
[30:27] But the purpose of these spirits
[30:30] is to bring people
[30:33] into the chains of darkness.
[30:37] Now the Bible says because we know we
[30:41] all came from darkness.
[30:43] But now when you come into light
[30:48] and then you reject the light,
[30:51] you get into everlasting chains of
[30:54] darkness.
[30:58] In other words, you are eternally
[31:00] separated from God.
[31:03] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, in the
[31:05] message, the souls that are in prison,
[31:11] he says, Jesus said, "Many will come to
[31:14] me in that day
[31:17] and say, I have done all these things.
[31:21] They eat mana in the wilderness."
[31:24] And Jesus Jesus said they are everyone
[31:27] eternally separated.
[31:36] They are dead.
[31:38] That is eternally God.
[31:44] They perished right there in the
[31:46] wilderness.
[31:49] You remember Hebrews chapter 6
[31:54] once that was once made known the truth
[31:59] and refuse to walk in it
[32:04] there is no more repentance for them.
[32:09] See
[32:11] a borderline believer
[32:14] when the truth is presented to a person
[32:17] for the last time
[32:21] and they refuse to walk in it.
[32:25] They refuse to receive it
[32:28] according to the book of Hebrews.
[32:31] There is not even nothing in the world
[32:36] that can ever save them.
[32:38] They are finished.
[32:41] No repentance,
[32:44] no redemption.
[32:46] There is nothing left for them.
[32:53] What is that? What is their condition?
[32:55] They in everlasting chains of darkness.
[33:00] In other words, they are in the
[33:02] condition like the demons are.
[33:06] You know they can never come to the
[33:08] knowledge of the truth.
[33:11] They can never turn away from their evil
[33:13] ways.
[33:15] Then he says they are eternally
[33:18] separated.
[33:20] The Bible said so looking for the
[33:22] fearful fire and indignation which shall
[33:25] devour the adversary.
[33:29] I mean,
[33:32] and when the truth of the gospel has
[33:34] been proven,
[33:38] thoroughly vindicated,
[33:42] and then turn around and walk from it,
[33:48] they are finished.
[33:51] That is all.
[33:53] It is awful.
[33:56] But I have to tell it.
[34:00] Remember the angels
[34:02] which kept not their first estate
[34:06] but left there in prison but left there
[34:10] in that prison house in darkness.
[34:18] Where the world is walking today in the
[34:21] same prison.
[34:25] There is no repentance.
[34:29] Remember a few years ago.
[34:33] I said when I come down from Chicago,
[34:38] &gt;&gt; either America will receive it this year
[34:43] or she won't receive it at all.
[34:47] See where she has gone.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Let us turn
[34:52] to the book of Hebrews chapter 6.
[34:56] And then we go to verse four.
[35:03] For it is impossible for those who were
[35:05] once enlightened and have tested of the
[35:08] heavenly gift and we are made partakers
[35:11] of the Holy Ghost.
[35:23] And I've tested the good word of God and
[35:26] the powers of the world to come.
[35:36] If they shall fall away to renew them
[35:39] unto repentance, seeing they crucify to
[35:41] themselves the son of God aresh and put
[35:45] him to open shame.
[36:04] So these people who have known the truth
[36:08] and the Bible says now here that it is
[36:11] impossible for those who were once
[36:14] enlightened.
[36:18] In other words, their eyes were opened.
[36:21] And then the Bible says they have tested
[36:24] of the heavenly gift.
[36:28] In other words, the blessings of God
[36:31] and they were made partakers of the Holy
[36:34] Ghost.
[36:36] Now to be a partaker,
[36:40] in other words, they had a benefit
[36:44] of the Holy Spirit.
[36:47] They can give a testimony.
[36:49] God healed me here. God delivered me
[36:53] here. God used me in this kind of
[36:56] situation.
[36:58] You know, they would maybe get gifts of
[37:00] the Holy Spirit,
[37:04] not the life of the Holy Spirit.
[37:07] Like in Matthew chapter 7,
[37:09] these people had partaken of the Holy
[37:12] Spirit.
[37:14] They were speaking in tong. Hear
[37:20] what I'm saying? Now the Bible says they
[37:24] were partakers.
[37:27] Now in other words, they they took a
[37:30] gift or they received like a blessing of
[37:33] the Holy Ghost.
[37:37] In other words, they were blessed like
[37:38] in healing.
[37:42] Maybe they spoke in tongues.
[37:45] Maybe they prophesied
[37:47] or they prayed for the people and got
[37:49] healed
[37:51] by the Holy Spirit.
[37:54] Let us put it this other way.
[37:57] The 12 spies
[38:00] when they went to the land of promise.
[38:03] When they went to Cananan's land,
[38:06] each of them came with the fruits of the
[38:08] land.
[38:11] Praise the name of our Lord. When they
[38:13] came back with the fruits
[38:15] that there is a land beyond this place,
[38:20] evidence
[38:22] they came with the fruits and the
[38:25] congregation
[38:27] that the land is there.
[38:30] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[38:31] they showed it. They gave a testimony
[38:34] that these are the fruits of the land
[38:38] like a divine healing.
[38:41] Divine healing reflects living without
[38:44] death.
[38:48] In other words, it shows that there is
[38:49] life eternal.
[38:53] But you can be healed today and then you
[38:56] fall sick the following day and even you
[38:59] die. BUT THAT POWER OF GOD that has
[39:01] healed you
[39:04] is a forward test.
[39:06] You know, like they got the fruits from
[39:08] the land
[39:11] and they were eating them from the
[39:12] wilderness.
[39:14] But now the 10 spies,
[39:17] they gave a false testimony.
[39:22] We cannot take over that land.
[39:24] But yet they had eaten of the fruit.
[39:27] So this is the same thing of partaking
[39:30] of the Holy Spirit
[39:33] but then rejecting
[39:36] the life of the Holy Spirit. In other
[39:39] words, THEY WERE NOT BAPTIZED WITH THE
[39:40] Holy Spirit
[39:43] but they had the Holy Spirit to use them
[39:49] maybe in speaking in tongues, in
[39:52] prophesying, in doing miracles. Mthew
[39:55] chapter 7 where I say that go away from
[39:59] me you workers of iniquity.
[40:03] So this is what the Bible is talking
[40:05] about.
[40:07] The children in the wilderness.
[40:09] They had partaken of the blessings of
[40:12] God.
[40:14] Every day they were eating mana.
[40:17] Angels food.
[40:20] They had a pillar of fire before them.
[40:23] They had a cloud of glory before them.
[40:27] They had, you know, quills falling for
[40:29] them.
[40:31] So all these were blessings of God.
[40:35] They parttook of these blessings of God.
[40:39] But then they turned around.
[40:41] We cannot go and possess the land.
[40:45] So he says they were eternally separated
[40:48] from God.
[40:51] So that is the same condition
[40:54] that we live in today
[40:57] that there are spirits.
[41:00] There are people who come in
[41:04] and they want to turn you from the
[41:06] message of the hour
[41:09] and turn you to things which are wrong.
[41:13] Praise the name of the Lord. The cororas
[41:17] ah brother Brham is not right.
[41:21] That is a corora.
[41:23] Praise the name of God. All these are
[41:26] fables.
[41:28] Because the Bible says,
[41:31] you know, they come and then they tell
[41:33] you that the message is a fable.
[41:38] But what they are saying are the ones
[41:40] which are fables.
[41:45] So they want you to turn your heart
[41:49] from the message
[41:51] and that's what Conor was doing telling
[41:54] Moses who are you
[41:57] all of us are holy
[41:59] and he resisted Moses.
[42:03] So these same spirits are existing now.
[42:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Now we need
[42:10] to be very conscious
[42:14] because the spirits have come OUT AND
[42:17] THE BIBLE says they have come amongst us
[42:22] like we have a number of scenarios here.
[42:26] There are people who come in our mid
[42:29] and tell you you're not meant to come to
[42:31] church,
[42:33] stay at home and play your tapes only.
[42:40] You shouldn't give them your ear.
[42:43] You shouldn't follow them.
[42:46] Then there are others who come
[42:49] who have a confession there.
[42:51] Ask them, "Have you told the pastor
[42:54] about it?
[42:57] Praise the name of Lord. You don't just
[42:59] run because somebody has told you that
[43:00] there is a a meeting here.
[43:04] Like the Bible says when they tell you
[43:08] he's in the desert, he's in the secret
[43:11] chamber. The Bible says don't go. It's
[43:15] your protection.
[43:17] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[43:19] we are living in days of subility.
[43:25] Now let us go to Jeremiah chapter 28.
[43:30] Praise the name of our Lord. Now the
[43:32] Bible says verse one. And it came to
[43:36] pass the same year in the beginning of
[43:39] the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah,
[43:42] in the fourth year and in the fifth
[43:44] month, that Haniah, the son of Auza the
[43:47] prophet, which was of Gibon, spoke unto
[43:50] me in the house of the Lord, in the
[43:52] presence of the priests and all the
[43:55] people, saying,
[43:59] [music]
[44:10] Gib,
[44:23] thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God
[44:26] of Israel, saying, I have broken the
[44:29] yoke of the king of Babylon.
[44:40] Within two full years will I bring again
[44:44] in this place all the vessels of the
[44:46] Lord's house that Nebuchadnezzar, king
[44:49] of Babylon, took away from this place
[44:51] and carried them to Babylon.
[45:12] Now Jeremiah, the true prophet of the
[45:16] day,
[45:18] the messenger of the day
[45:22] given them the true word of God.
[45:26] said 70 years
[45:29] you'll be in Babylon
[45:32] and he said you must obey that
[45:36] in obeying that
[45:38] you are going to be safe
[45:41] but in rejecting it you are going to be
[45:44] destroyed
[45:46] and then he told them if you you say
[45:49] that you are going to be here
[45:52] you are going to be destroyed of the
[45:54] sword
[45:56] You're going to be destroyed of
[45:58] pestilence.
[46:01] You're going to be destroyed of hunger.
[46:04] Their safety was going to Babylon
[46:09] because God wanted the land to have her
[46:11] Sabbath.
[46:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Now,
[46:18] Haniah,
[46:20] a prophet of God. Now Haniah was not an
[46:25] idol worshipper
[46:29] and this is what the devil does.
[46:32] He gets one amongst us.
[46:37] Ah that brother is a good minister of
[46:39] the message.
[46:42] Let us go and hear
[46:45] and here there was a conversion in the
[46:47] temple
[46:49] and we like going to conventions.
[46:53] Find out
[46:55] first. Find out.
[46:57] Don't just run because you have been
[46:59] invited to a convention.
[47:03] Because this convention was in the
[47:05] temple in Jerusalem,
[47:08] the priests of God were there.
[47:11] The princes were there.
[47:14] The people were there. Even Jeremiah was
[47:17] invited into.
[47:21] Now they are subtile spirits
[47:25] that they can bring a true Jeremiah
[47:30] and they give him only one service in
[47:31] the whole convention.
[47:35] But all the services and the days are
[47:37] false teachers.
[47:43] They give Jeremiah only one hour.
[47:47] Even Jeremiah is coming.
[47:51] to make the conversion look right.
[47:55] We should be careful,
[47:58] what meetings we go to.
[48:00] Praise the name of just run.
[48:04] We have enough food here.
[48:07] Praise the name of we have enough food.
[48:10] You know, there are some people then
[48:13] they say, you know, we don't have
[48:14] overnight every Friday.
[48:19] Then they said, "Let us cross the road
[48:20] because they have every Friday."
[48:27] You are going to end up being deceived.
[48:31] We don't have morning glory.
[48:35] We don't have lunch hour.
[48:38] Let me go here where I can have lunch
[48:39] hour.
[48:42] You have enough to hear.
[48:45] Praise the name of the Lord. We record
[48:47] all our sermons here.
[48:50] We record them.
[48:52] We put them on our platform.
[48:55] WhatsApp. We have five radio programs
[48:57] every week.
[48:59] Do you take time to listen to all these
[49:01] things?
[49:04] Do you take time to listen to all these
[49:05] things?
[49:12] We have morning exaltation.
[49:15] Do you take time and then you say let me
[49:18] listen to what the Holy Spirit is
[49:20] inspiring to be said today.
[49:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Now there
[49:27] is a scenario in some place
[49:31] and then they were telling the people
[49:33] you come to the mountain and we pray
[49:37] and then they organize a weekend maybe
[49:39] once in a month.
[49:45] Then they collect you from different
[49:46] places
[49:49] and Jesus said
[49:52] you shall not worship God on this
[49:53] mountain.
[49:58] Praise the name of Allah. Is taking you
[50:00] back to the mountain.
[50:04] Praise the name of Allah. So there are a
[50:06] lot of deception that has come amongst
[50:08] us
[50:11] that we need to be careful.
[50:14] Where do you feed from?
[50:17] Praise the name of Lord. Where do you
[50:19] feed from?
[50:21] Like this was a conversion
[50:24] in the temple.
[50:27] The princes were there.
[50:30] The people were there. The priests were
[50:33] there. Even Jeremiah was invited.
[50:37] But the conversion, the main preacher
[50:39] was Hania.
[50:44] And he said, "Two years."
[50:48] Contrary to the message of the hour
[50:51] and we can have the same spirits come
[50:54] among the stars
[50:57] that can draw you from the truth
[51:01] and turn and then you find yourself you
[51:03] are going by something wrong.
[51:08] Praise the name of the Lord. I just want
[51:10] to read some quote here
[51:12] in the message. Does God change his mind
[51:14] about his word?
[51:19] He says, "And we find that we find out
[51:24] that Balam
[51:27] went down there
[51:30] and begin to teach the people
[51:33] and he had an error.
[51:37] But Balam
[51:39] was a prophet of God.
[51:42] He would prophesy such wonderful
[51:45] prophecies.
[51:48] But there was something wrong in him.
[51:53] Then he says, "And he ran in the way of
[51:56] Balam,
[51:59] how that he did
[52:02] and taught Balac,
[52:05] and the children of Israel
[52:08] committed adultery,
[52:12] and the plague struck the nation of
[52:14] Israel.
[52:17] the people and thousands of them died in
[52:20] one day
[52:23] and while okay we shall jump that
[52:26] &gt;&gt; sorry okay
[52:28] &gt;&gt; then he says
[52:29] &gt;&gt; but what happened
[52:33] &gt;&gt; he succeeded
[52:38] he succeeded in weakening Israel
[52:44] what did He do he weakened their camp.
[52:51] God let him go
[52:55] and weakened their camp
[53:00] and it polluted the whole camp.
[53:05] That's what they do.
[53:09] You know, if you want the Holy Ghost,
[53:12] jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, and
[53:15] everybody jumps.
[53:17] I said that since I've jumped, I felt
[53:20] somehow good. I have the Holy Ghost.
[53:24] They weaken.
[53:27] They They faith
[53:30] you into something which is true.
[53:34] You take the things of God lightly.
[53:39] And then he says,
[53:41] &gt;&gt; "And when when some doctrine start
[53:48] the Bible truth,
[53:52] it pollutes the whole camp.
[53:56] Somebody raise up with a different idea
[53:58] like Kora
[54:04] and say, "Well, this you know that the
[54:09] other I got a different idea
[54:13] &gt;&gt; it pollutes the whole camp
[54:18] like we can say the whole church
[54:21] and that's what done the whole church
[54:23] camp today
[54:29] teaching as he did
[54:32] weakening the whole camp of Kadesh for
[54:34] Kadesh Baadesh
[54:38] The word showed down
[54:41] when they got to Kadesha
[54:44] then the weakening of the camp
[54:48] then they come back
[54:50] then he said remember they had eat
[54:54] angels food
[54:58] they had the word of God
[55:01] every night made manifest
[55:05] and they eat the
[55:07] They drink from the rock.
[55:10] They did all
[55:12] seen miracles.
[55:14] They watched Moses
[55:16] and seen his word,
[55:19] his prophecies, everything.
[55:21] And then finally
[55:25] when they listen to the false teacher
[55:30] come among them
[55:33] and teach wrong.
[55:36] He weakened the camp
[55:38] and prospered by it.
[55:43] Praise the name of Lord. So we need to
[55:45] be careful.
[55:47] You don't just run
[55:50] find out.
[55:51] Who are these people?
[55:54] Praise the name of Lord. They don't just
[55:57] run. You know, I've taken long without
[55:59] in being having a convention.
[56:04] At home, we have only one day's meeting,
[56:07] but I want to go to a residential
[56:09] convention somewhere.
[56:14] Be conscious.
[56:16] Praise the name of the Lord.
[56:19] Haniah and his team
[56:22] they organized a conversion.
[56:25] Let us go back to Jeremiah chapter 28.
[56:30] and he said two years
[56:34] I wouldn't want to hear that message
[56:41] said years
[56:44] but the other prophet says
[56:48] who doesn't want to hear that true good
[56:50] amen god has reduced our burden
[56:55] and to demonstrate that he meant what he
[56:58] meant.
[57:01] He went and got the yoke of wood
[57:08] from Jeremiah
[57:11] AND BROKE IT. OH, TWO YEARS.
[57:15] I never said, "Amen.
[57:19] Going to come back. My grandmother is
[57:22] going to come back.
[57:24] God has done us so good.
[57:27] like the prosperity gospel that is
[57:29] taking place.
[57:33] Lord, this year I'm increased with good,
[57:37] I have need of nothing. And somebody
[57:40] feels happy about that.
[57:44] Praise the name of the Lord. So now
[57:47] Jeremiah
[57:49] just came to the convention
[57:51] and said, "Amen."
[57:55] What would he say?
[57:58] They can even lynch you.
[58:04] So the Bible says in verse five,
[58:09] &gt;&gt; then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the
[58:11] prophet Ananiah in the presence of the
[58:14] priests and in the presence of all the
[58:15] people that stood in the house of God,
[58:34] Now,
[58:36] so Jeremiah questioned,
[58:41] &gt;&gt; you know, he he kind of like warned him
[58:46] and he told him,
[58:49] &gt;&gt; verse six, Even the prophet Jeremiah
[58:52] said, "Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; The Lord do so. The Lord perform thy
[58:56] words which thou hast prophesied to
[58:58] bring again the vessels of the Lord's
[59:00] house and all that carried away captive
[59:02] from Babylon into this place.
[59:26] Nevertheless, hear now this word that I
[59:28] speak in thine ear and the ears of all
[59:31] the people.
[59:42] The prophets that have been before me
[59:45] and before you of old prophesied both
[59:48] against many countries and against great
[59:51] kingdoms of war and of evil and of
[59:54] pestilence.
[1:00:17] The prophets which prophesied peace.
[1:00:19] When the word of the prophet shall come
[1:00:21] to pass, then shall the prophet be known
[1:00:24] that the Lord has truly sent him.
[1:00:37] Then the prophet took the yoke from off
[1:00:41] the prophet Jeremiah's neck and break
[1:00:44] it.
[1:00:52] saying, "Thus says the Lord, even so
[1:00:56] will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:00:58] king of Babylon, from the neck of all
[1:01:01] nations within the space of two full
[1:01:03] years." And the prophet Jeremiah went
[1:01:07] his way.
[1:01:32] Now you see
[1:01:35] is the main preacher
[1:01:38] and then they bring in Jeremiah to just
[1:01:40] say the meeting was good. Even Jeremiah
[1:01:42] pastor Jeremiah was there.
[1:01:48] Give him one service.
[1:01:51] He can't remove everything has preached
[1:01:57] preaching.
[1:01:58] The set time is over.
[1:02:01] Then Haniah comes back with a great
[1:02:04] demonstration
[1:02:07] and breaks the yoke of Jeremiah.
[1:02:10] Two full years
[1:02:13] and then the conversion closes.
[1:02:16] And then you come back to church
[1:02:19] with contrary mind.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; I think what I heard there it was the
[1:02:28] true
[1:02:33] which he preaches I doubt from when
[1:02:37] if you didn't go and eat from the wrong
[1:02:38] stuff.
[1:02:41] Praise the name of our lord. And that's
[1:02:43] what the devil does.
[1:02:45] comes in privately.
[1:02:48] I think here there is something wrong.
[1:02:52] I think maybe if I can get a job and go
[1:02:54] to the other place
[1:02:58] or you become too busy to come to church
[1:03:02] and see where you can get where you can
[1:03:04] be fed by.
[1:03:08] But the Bible says Haniah
[1:03:12] taught people rebellion.
[1:03:16] Praise the name of our Lord. When God
[1:03:18] has said something
[1:03:21] and you hear something contrary,
[1:03:24] it is teaching you rebellion.
[1:03:28] And when you are taught rebellion
[1:03:31] and you follow rebellion,
[1:03:34] you end up into chains of darkness.
[1:03:43] because you have despised what has
[1:03:45] helped you.
[1:03:48] You have left it. You get yourself into
[1:03:51] bondage.
[1:03:54] So now God told Jeremiah
[1:03:57] in verse 13, "Go and tell Han rather
[1:04:01] Haniah, go and tell Haniah, saying, Thus
[1:04:04] says the Lord, thou hast broken the
[1:04:07] yolks of wood, but thou shalt make for
[1:04:09] them yolks of iron."
[1:04:23] So from wood,
[1:04:26] iron, no worstation.
[1:04:31] You've been having some form of weakness
[1:04:33] which you are praying to God to help you
[1:04:35] overcome
[1:04:39] and then you go and hear the false
[1:04:41] teachers
[1:04:44] yourself into greater weakness.
[1:04:49] Brother Brandham said, "False teaching
[1:04:54] pollutes the camp.
[1:04:56] It pollutes your heart. It weakens you
[1:05:00] further.
[1:05:03] You become too weak
[1:05:05] until you end up rejecting the word of
[1:05:08] God.
[1:05:10] You start living like the rest of them."
[1:05:14] So he told him, "Make the one of
[1:05:18] There was greater bondage than what you
[1:05:20] have been in.
[1:05:23] Now in verse 15,
[1:05:25] then thus said the prophet Jeremiah unto
[1:05:28] Haniah
[1:05:30] the prophet here. Now Haniah, the Lord
[1:05:33] has not sent you, but you make the
[1:05:37] people to trust in a lie.
[1:05:51] So false teachers
[1:05:55] are very smart.
[1:05:57] They are so smart in their form of
[1:06:00] delivery
[1:06:04] until you would give them the ear
[1:06:13] and
[1:06:16] the Bible says they were renown men.
[1:06:20] Maybe when they would come to speak,
[1:06:24] it was very eloquent.
[1:06:28] It was so demonstrative.
[1:06:34] But now when Moses comes to speak,
[1:06:38] he's a stammer
[1:06:43] until you get tired of hearing him
[1:06:44] speak.
[1:06:47] His speech is just flat.
[1:06:53] But the other one know how to choose to
[1:06:55] turn this to
[1:06:58] and they excite your ears.
[1:07:03] The Bible says preachers having itching
[1:07:06] ears.
[1:07:12] We'll come back and hear that which
[1:07:15] when you go to most of these funerals,
[1:07:18] you know they just talk about stories.
[1:07:22] This fable here, the other there, the
[1:07:26] other one there.
[1:07:28] Praise the name of God. Now in verse 16,
[1:07:32] therefore thus says the Lord, behold,
[1:07:35] I'll cast thee from off the face of the
[1:07:37] earth. This year, thou shalt die because
[1:07:41] you have taught rebellion against the
[1:07:44] Lord.
[1:07:57] false teachers.
[1:07:59] Anything contrary to the message of the
[1:08:01] hour
[1:08:04] is teaching you rebellion against God.
[1:08:09] So if you hear anything contrary,
[1:08:13] put it aside
[1:08:15] because it has come
[1:08:18] to take you into the chains of darkness.
[1:08:22] Praise the name of the Lord. Let us go
[1:08:25] to second Peter chapter one
[1:08:30] just not enough.
[1:08:33] But I want so we can wind up within the
[1:08:35] next 15 minutes or so.
[1:08:41] Now we see here that every other time
[1:08:46] the truth has always been resisted.
[1:08:51] The truth has always been talked evil
[1:08:54] against.
[1:08:56] Now in 1 second 2 Peter 1:15
[1:09:02] he says, "Moreover, I will endeavor that
[1:09:05] you may be able for after my disease to
[1:09:08] have these things always in
[1:09:11] remembrance."
[1:09:24] Then he says, "The world says we have
[1:09:27] followed fables,
[1:09:32] but we have not followed cunningly
[1:09:34] devised fables of the message of the
[1:09:37] hour.
[1:09:49] when we made known unto you the power
[1:09:51] and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:09:54] but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
[1:10:01] So he's talking about these things that
[1:10:03] they are true.
[1:10:07] When brother Brham talks about the
[1:10:09] cloud,
[1:10:11] how the seven angels left
[1:10:15] the cloud in the sky.
[1:10:19] It is not able.
[1:10:22] It is not the airplanes that put that
[1:10:25] cloud in the sky.
[1:10:30] It is not it is not artificial
[1:10:33] intelligence.
[1:10:38] When the pillar of fire appeared on his
[1:10:40] head,
[1:10:42] it is not a photo shooting,
[1:10:51] but this is what the devil is spreading
[1:10:53] around
[1:10:56] so that they weaken your faith
[1:10:59] and you disregard the message that we
[1:11:01] have received.
[1:11:04] So he says these things are true.
[1:11:08] Don't hear somebody who tells you it is
[1:11:10] wrong.
[1:11:13] No, those are dans and coras.
[1:11:18] No, they are false teachers.
[1:11:21] Put them aside.
[1:11:23] Praise the name of So now he says we
[1:11:25] have not followed fables
[1:11:28] but we have followed the truth.
[1:11:32] And then the Bible says
[1:11:34] in verse 19,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; for we hope we we also have a sure word
[1:11:39] of prophecy.
[1:11:48] A sure word of prophecy.
[1:11:51] The prophet, the message says or the
[1:11:54] Bible says IN THE DAYS OF THE VOICE of
[1:11:57] the seventh angel
[1:12:00] shall begin to sound.
[1:12:03] All the God should be finished.
[1:12:07] We are living in the end time
[1:12:11] pass. That is a sure word of prophecy.
[1:12:16] Praise the name of our Lord. The truth
[1:12:18] has been revealed to us.
[1:12:21] Then how do you say the truth has not
[1:12:22] been revealed to us?
[1:12:25] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[1:12:27] continues to say
[1:12:30] that you take heed as a light shines in
[1:12:33] the darkness.
[1:12:36] That same verse.
[1:12:44] Now there is a lot of darkness.
[1:12:48] There's a lot of opposition against the
[1:12:50] message.
[1:12:53] We know outsiders opposite.
[1:12:58] But if we get opposition from within
[1:13:03] is more destructive than the one from
[1:13:04] outside.
[1:13:07] The dan's coming in the camp.
[1:13:10] Balam's coming into the camp
[1:13:14] more destruction.
[1:13:17] Praise the name of the Lord. We need to
[1:13:19] be careful
[1:13:21] where we feed from. Don't just run to go
[1:13:25] to a conversion.
[1:13:29] Find out. I've been invited here.
[1:13:33] There's a brother who fellowshipped with
[1:13:35] us.
[1:13:36] He has invited me to a meeting
[1:13:38] somewhere.
[1:13:42] Praise the name of our Lord. There are
[1:13:44] some people who are no longer coming to
[1:13:45] church because of that.
[1:13:48] They're comfortable sitting at home
[1:13:50] because they have been taught different.
[1:13:55] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[1:13:57] to be conscious
[1:13:59] that he may be destroying your soul.
[1:14:04] Praise the name of our Lord. Verse 20.
[1:14:07] Knowing this first that no prophecy of
[1:14:09] the scripture is of any private
[1:14:12] interpretation.
[1:14:28] For the prophecy came not in old time by
[1:14:31] the will of man, but holy men of God
[1:14:34] spoke as they were moved by the Holy
[1:14:36] Ghost.
[1:14:51] Praise the name of Lord. Let us go to
[1:14:53] Jude as I finish.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Verse three to verse seven.
[1:15:03] Jude says, "Beloved, I gave all
[1:15:05] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:15:08] common salvation. It was needful for me
[1:15:11] to write unto you and exalt you that you
[1:15:14] should earnestly contend for the faith
[1:15:17] which was once delivered unto the
[1:15:19] saints.
[1:15:42] He says contain
[1:15:46] take time read the message books.
[1:15:51] Praise the name of take time.
[1:15:58] Praise the name of By the way.
[1:16:09] Take time read the message book.
[1:16:14] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:16:20] Like if I'm
[1:16:32] [laughter]
[1:16:34] not talking about that
[1:16:38] praise the name of our Lord
[1:16:41] the way you sit down I'm going to do
[1:16:43] this
[1:16:45] and read the message.
[1:16:48] Sit and hear the message.
[1:16:52] All your mind to these things
[1:16:57] not.
[1:17:01] Praise the name of Lord because the
[1:17:03] enemy is fighting
[1:17:05] and is so sub is attacking inside and
[1:17:08] outside.
[1:17:12] They attacking everywhere.
[1:17:15] Praise the name of the Lord. So you need
[1:17:17] to take time
[1:17:19] to be honestly content for the faith
[1:17:25] that was once delivered to the saints.
[1:17:28] Why? Verse four.
[1:17:31] He says, "For there are certain men
[1:17:37] who crept in
[1:17:40] how unaware
[1:17:51] has sent this one to you know I've read
[1:17:54] this message book
[1:17:56] but you know here brother made a mistake
[1:18:01] but you've already given him your heart
[1:18:04] crept in unaware
[1:18:09] the Bible says they were before ordained
[1:18:12] to condemnation.
[1:18:19] But for you don't know that God says
[1:18:21] this one here is like Pharaoh
[1:18:26] unodly man.
[1:18:29] They don't show what they do,
[1:18:34] but then you just believe what they
[1:18:35] telling you
[1:18:38] because the Bible says there are walls
[1:18:43] in the sheep skin.
[1:18:46] So you see the skin comes to church,
[1:18:50] there's a minister,
[1:18:53] maybe he has this place
[1:18:59] this place
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; and is a wolf.
[1:19:02] And then he says, you just go there
[1:19:07] turning the grace of our God into
[1:19:09] lasciviousness,
[1:19:14] denying the only Lord and our Lord Jesus
[1:19:17] Christ.
[1:19:22] He puts us to remembrance.
[1:19:26] Verse five,
[1:19:28] that the Lord having saved the people
[1:19:30] out of the land of Egypt.
[1:19:44] Afterward destroyed them that believed
[1:19:47] not.
[1:19:53] Why? There were false teachers amongst
[1:19:56] them.
[1:19:58] Prophets among them
[1:20:01] teaching rebellion
[1:20:05] teaching the people that we are one
[1:20:09] of the feast of
[1:20:13] white women were dancing.
[1:20:17] Everybody picked one,
[1:20:20] you know, coming in an awareness
[1:20:24] and brought destruction in the camp.
[1:20:29] Then another example, verse six, and the
[1:20:33] angels which kept not their first
[1:20:34] estate, but left their habitation, he
[1:20:37] has reserved in everlasting chains under
[1:20:40] darkness unto the judgment of the great
[1:20:43] day.
[1:21:04] Even as Sodom and Gomorra and the cities
[1:21:06] about them like in a like manner, giving
[1:21:09] themselves over to fornication, and
[1:21:11] going after strange flesh, and set forth
[1:21:14] an example, suffering the vengeance of
[1:21:17] eternal fire.
[1:21:48] Praise the name of Lord. So we are
[1:21:50] living at the end time.
[1:21:52] There are spirits that are opposing our
[1:21:55] third exodus.
[1:21:58] They come amongst us.
[1:22:01] We need to be very careful.
[1:22:04] Because these spirits use people
[1:22:08] to make sure that we go back into the
[1:22:10] chains of darkness
[1:22:15] to make us reject what we believe.
[1:22:19] But the message that we have is our only
[1:22:23] place of atonement
[1:22:26] in the name of our Lord. Our atonement,
[1:22:29] our forgiveness of sins,
[1:22:32] our deliverance from unbelief
[1:22:36] is in the message of God.
[1:22:39] That's what we need to hold tight
[1:22:42] and don't allow to be swayed aside.
[1:22:46] May God bless you.
[1:22:49] Amen. Amen. [applause]
[1:22:51] Let us sing this song and each of us can
[1:22:54] pray.
[1:23:00] I can hear
[1:23:04] my savior
[1:23:08] calling.
[1:23:12] I can hear
[1:23:16] my savior
[1:23:20] calling.
[1:23:23] I can hear
[1:23:27] my savior
[1:23:31] calling.
[1:23:35] Take thy cross.
[1:23:40] Follow
[1:23:47] me [music] where he leads me now.
[1:23:52] Where he leads
[1:23:55] me,
[1:23:57] I
[1:23:59] will follow.
[1:24:05] Where he leads
[1:24:08] me,
[1:24:10] I
[1:24:12] will follow.
[1:24:19] He leads
[1:24:22] me.
[1:24:24] I
[1:24:26] will follow.
[1:24:32] I'll go with
[1:24:36] him. [music]
[1:24:38] With [singing] him
[1:24:41] all
[1:24:44] the way. I'll go with him through the
[1:24:47] garden. Our
[1:24:49] going
[1:24:52] [music]
[1:24:53] through
[1:24:56] the garden
[1:25:02] are going
[1:25:06] [singing and music]
[1:25:07] through
[1:25:10] the garden day. [singing and music]
[1:25:15] I'll go with
[1:25:19] him [singing]
[1:25:20] through
[1:25:23] the garden.
[1:25:28] [music and singing]
[1:25:29] I'll go with
[1:25:34] [singing]
[1:25:37] all
[1:25:40] the way. Where I need you, we've got to
[1:25:42] pray. [music]
[1:25:44] Oh, where he [singing] leads
[1:25:48] me,
[1:25:50] I
[1:25:53] will follow
[1:25:55] Lord. [singing]
[1:25:58] [music]
[1:25:59] Where he leads
[1:26:02] me,
[1:26:04] I
[1:26:06] will [singing]
[1:26:07] follow.
[1:26:10] [music]
[1:26:12] Where he [singing] leads
[1:26:15] me,
[1:26:17] I
[1:26:19] will follow.
[1:26:25] [singing and music]
[1:26:25] I'll go with
[1:26:29] him,
[1:26:30] within
[1:26:32] [singing]
[1:26:34] all
[1:26:36] the way. Each of us can speak to [music]
[1:26:39] the Lord. Father, how we thank you,
[1:26:41] Father, for your love, grace, and mercy.
[1:26:44] Lord, your goodness, Father, has saved
[1:26:48] our souls, has redeemed us, [music]
[1:26:50] Father. You've given unto us the
[1:26:52] message, Father, with all infallible
[1:26:55] proofs, Lord. But how evil Satan is that
[1:26:58] he lets [music] people get amongst us to
[1:27:01] make us doubt the message, to make
[1:27:04] [music] us, oh God, have things that
[1:27:06] question the message. How we pray you
[1:27:09] may help us heavenly father that all
[1:27:11] these wicked spirits. How the Bible says
[1:27:15] that of old be ordained to condemnation
[1:27:18] and then they want to have a platform.
[1:27:20] [music]
[1:27:20] They want to have a pulpit. They want to
[1:27:22] have a place for us to give them ears.
[1:27:25] We pray you may help us heavenly father.
[1:27:28] And how the bible warns us of the false
[1:27:30] brethren [music]
[1:27:31] that came to us to turn away from truth.
[1:27:35] Oh God we pray give us the grace in the
[1:27:38] name of Jesus Christ not even to give
[1:27:40] them an hour not even a time not even a
[1:27:43] platform not even an opportunity that
[1:27:46] they can come forth with their [music]
[1:27:47] heresies Lord we pray may help us
[1:27:50] heavenly father to live upright Lord
[1:27:53] without heavenly father having doubt in
[1:27:55] the message that you've given unto us
[1:27:57] Lord [music] that we may cherish the
[1:27:59] word you've given unto us we may cherish
[1:28:01] the message you've given unto us you may
[1:28:03] lead us heavenly Father in the path of
[1:28:05] truth and righteousness for your holy
[1:28:07] name's sake. Oh God, how we need you,
[1:28:10] heavenly father. How we glorify your
[1:28:12] holy name. How we magnify your holy
[1:28:14] name. How we call upon thee father. Come
[1:28:18] and help us Lord Jesus. Come and deliver
[1:28:20] us heavenly father from all the ways of
[1:28:23] sin. From all the ways of Satan, from
[1:28:26] all his deception and all [music] his
[1:28:28] wicked ways, all his wicked instruments.
[1:28:30] Heavenly Father, we need you. Heavenly
[1:28:33] Father, deliver us. Lord, oh God, guide
[1:28:36] us. Heavenly Father, direct us. Heavenly
[1:28:39] Father, instruct us to walk in the path
[1:28:42] of truth and righteousness for your holy
[1:28:44] name's sake. Oh God, for your name is
[1:28:46] great. Lord, for your name is holy.
[1:28:48] Heavenly Father, for your name change,
[1:28:51] not heavenly father. [music] Oh God, we
[1:28:53] need you, Lord Jesus. We worship you,
[1:28:55] heavenly father. We adore you, heavenly
[1:28:58] father. [music] We glorify your holy
[1:29:00] name. Come to our rescue, Father. That
[1:29:03] all these evil spirits, all these powers
[1:29:05] of darkness in the name of Jesus, may
[1:29:08] all they be exposed in our midst, that
[1:29:10] we may not, Father, give them another
[1:29:12] time or heed or follow what they are
[1:29:15] saying. But help us, Father, that we may
[1:29:17] follow the truth with all our heart,
[1:29:19] with everything [music] that is in us,
[1:29:21] Lord, and not follow rebellion and not
[1:29:24] follow lies and not trust lies, oh God.
[1:29:27] But father, we [music] may depend upon
[1:29:28] you, Lord Jesus, and believe all the
[1:29:31] truth and live by the truth. For how you
[1:29:33] say, man shall not live by bread, but by
[1:29:37] every word that comes out of the mouth
[1:29:40] of God. And you've given unto us your
[1:29:42] word in this day. [music] We pray you
[1:29:44] may help us, Father, to stand firm,
[1:29:47] Father, with the truth, Lord Jesus, in
[1:29:49] the name of Jesus [music] Christ, that
[1:29:51] you may help every one of us in our
[1:29:53] weaknesses, guiding us and directing us,
[1:29:55] [music]
[1:29:56] revealing yourself to us, manifesting
[1:29:58] yourself to us and showing us the path
[1:30:00] that we have to take. How we love your
[1:30:02] heavenly father, how we glorify your
