father give them good health and a stable mind I commit them into your hands that you may just give them the wisdom of Joseph to look father dear Lord God into the depth of secred things Lord and bring come out with an understanding we commit you the word teach it Lord with anointing in Jesus name amen so uh today uh let's go to Hebrews 11 verse 8 we shall read that scripture and then we shall sit and still continue reading scripture amen so [Music] 118 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into place which you should after receive for an inheritance he had to go into the place for him to possess it later for an inheritance so Footprints his possession which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing where he was going that is Faith may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated you know there are many men that are mentioned in Hebrews 11 and they are refer to as a cloud of witness but the one who occupies the greater part among them is Abraham his way of Faith had different Dimension Street amen verse 9 says by faith he Sant in the land of promise verse 9 as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the hairs with him of the same promise for he had looked for a city which had foundations build and make his God Abraham had a long Vision he had a vision of a city he says no I've been around a little while but I cannot really believe this is the city that God promises he was looking much ahead of himself and when God called him to go into country into a city in there he looked for that City amen you get into the land look for a city and he kept looking for a city so this morning I believe we are in the land of the ho ghost that was promised but in it we look for a city whose build and maker is God himself and one of these days eternity is going to reveal that City amen verse 11 he says through faith also sah received strength conceive SE and was delivered of a child when she was past age because he judged him faithful who had promised praise the Lord so how many would feel this morning that my womb is there I'm not really being able to bring the fruit of the spirit you see by faith God himself give Sarah strength hallelujah hallelujah if you feel dead spiritually we serve a God who gave sah strength to amen the moment she stepped into his you step into his presence just pull on him and he will drop strength to conceive seed that Christ may be born in your womb that you may display the character of Christ that you would come forth with all the fruit of the spirit are you together with me so verse 12 here therefore sprang there even one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sun which is by the seashore innumerable verse 12 and then 13 praise the Lord so this is now Hebrews 11:12 amen was the picture of death and the resurrection of Christ and he says all Israel was born of him that was as though he was dead amen you remember when he was taken up the mount for you know the sacrifice now verse 13 is very interesting these people here they kill fired as people the Seed of Abraham who knew that while they in the Land There is something better than the land hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord there was something ahead there that they were looking for and all of us much as we we are in the Redemption now but we are looking for something greater than what we have now amen the coming forth of the city the stepping forth the change of our bodies amen now all these people here not as they died before they saw the city they died with a face there will be a city one of these days amen he says in verse 13 died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them A Hallelujah and were persuaded of them and embrace them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrim on the for they that say such things deare plainly that they seek for a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country where they came out of they might have had an opportunity to return God have mercy if we are mindful of where we came from it is dangerous you might go back if you have trials bet tried in the faith and be found an overcomer don't desire to look back amen so you are all welcome back from the funeral and uh I appreciate your show of love to one of our own so today I'm going to speak on the subject of course I'm continuing with preaching stability but the subject today is write your history amen don't allow a man write your history but write your history so the scriptures in Hebrews 11 tell the stories of faith and one interesting observation is that the same Faith took these men through different routes of life amen One Faith but different routes of the same faith our path can never be the same some through the water some through the floods some through the fire but all through the blood that's the common denominator is the blood amen some through great Sorrows but God gives us a s amen oh I tell you the same Fai but different routes amen and we thank God for that same Faith praise God Amen so faith I mean does Not Duplicate our paths amen and therefore God not let another man write your history the faith is one but the routes are different so I can never write your history our trials are unique and so should be our victories also and therefore God knows that you are the best writer of your own story because no man can never walk your path amen the story of your life can only be performed by you because everyone will have a personal challenges and personal experiences and therefore personal victories is that amen somewhere we will have a personal history and history should easily be understood as his story are you together with me so this is what we are going to call history today his story and it is his story no man can write it Abram could not write the story of Moses neither could Moses write the story of [Applause] Noah you cannot write my story if you are brought in my shoes you cannot walk in my shoes just like I cannot walk in your shoes every one of us has got a battle to fight has got a restaurant that's the stability of the church whenever one of us know that his commission to be an overcomer so all these men here in Hebrews 11 had individual Journeys through the prage of the same Faith so the Journey of Abel now was about the authority of Revelation in worship amen a walk under sacrificial submission Noah's story was obedience to Divine instruction in the end time but Abram's story was one of looking for a city whose build and Mak was God himself of course abrah had more in the story of Faith than all the men that are mentioned in Hebrews 11 his story contains the revelation of the death and resurrection of Christ when he was giving forth his son Isaac as he moved to killing him when god holds his hand and then brings forth the lamb amen that lamb bear was the one who was worthy to die for your sin and amen praise the Lord and you know it's very interesting you see uh in this man's history Isaac and Jacob used the natural Blessing of Abraham upon their seeds because they inherited a blessing amen he says and I'll give unto thee unto thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger it was given to Abraham and the blessing person over to ISAC Jacob and then the Patriarchs amen hallelujah hallelujah it's very interesting we shall understand this as we go by and then we have this man Joseph here he had the revelation of the spot of the spot of the Holy Mountain and by Desiring his bones to be taken back into the land of promise he was telling Israel that at the end of this all there will be a Mount Zion show down yeah we've had three amen showdowns Mount camel Mount Calvary but the last one will be Mount Zion Oh Hallelujah there will be a rupture amen that was the revelation of Jacob and he says don't leave my bones out there because I know there was a reason going to be a resurrection you know sometimes when God reveals something it makes you act in a strange way amen it grips your heart it grips your mind it grips your actions amen so when Joseph got the reel of the body change he says what if that Revelation amen doesn't reach me simply because my bones are in Egypt ah when we are going back C my bones in this shall I see God amen amen amen praise the Lord the story of Moses was the story of an Exodus Exodus Prophet who by the same Faith also encountered another Prophet along the pilgrim J amen he met a competing anointing along the way amen just before the entering there came up another anointing who was equally a prophet amen but then he lost his anointing by the lack of understanding of what God was doing let me tell you friends we lose direction when we take this great anointing and use it to throw stones against one another ba was recruited to throw stones against the ministry of Moses you lose the anointing when you misuse the anointing that's why I say God will not allow one man to write your story you will always understand it better you'll understand what really convicted you and brought you to the Altar and that will go with you until you see your body change so we are all in this journey by a Divine personal relationship to the father and see sunship is a G amen that came from God this gen here will always be like the father but then since the body is many members together and all these bodies they operate differently every part of the body write his own story hallelujah hallelujah the eyes cannot write the story of the foot amen it was ordained to see And yet when they see what they see benefits the f are you together with me yeah we just want to understand this tonight I mean this morning amen so we are all in this journey simply because you has a relationship with the father I have a relationship with the father I a Jee and you are a part of the genes of God but a Je came down here on Earth to perform his commission differently and yet all of us together we make one body amen let's go to Second Corinthians chapter two I mean chapter 4 and verse six he says for God who has commanded the light to shine out of Darkness shined in our hearts why to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so now let me say this it takes Darkness for light to be relevant are you together with me and I know that no one but all of us are still struggling with some dark Sports of life that's why you are here because they are SP that must be clean because the promise is that the bride will be without spot or wrinkle so as long as we are still blood and flesh Lord let your light shine upon my life and I told you the other time that the light is our washing because when the light lights you begin to see the sports that require attention and this morning as God shines the light I trust that by the grace of God we shall start washing our dos amen it takes Darkness for light to be relevant and I know that one of you know uh it is you know this spot that God wants to shine upon amen light can only shine in darkness is this P that God would want to shine his light into to give us the knowledge of the glory of what is hidden in this vsel amen so let there be light God say but today we shall say God is saying let them be light and let us step into it amen there is a man here who can turn on the light and when he turns on the light step into the light he wants to give you the knowledge of the light of the glory of God and God's knowledge is not theological it's a Divine experience meaning that he once you to experience the light of his glory he wants you to be engulfed in that sh Glory it is a Shining Light it's a lifegiving light it's the light of our path amen once you step into it oh Hallelujah hallu once you step into that light I want tell you my brother it will give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God Amen verse S says but he says but where are your Treasures amen God is our treasure and he is in this is the light on the inside and he wants to light his glory and light our path but we have this treasure in a vessels that the Excellence of the power may be of God and not of us so we have the TR of the glory of that light in our vessels that glory is hidden behind these curtains of time but yet it is also expressed as a lived life you begin to take step and you cannot explain but people will see this man has got a special Light On th side there they'll see there is something that's happening on th side something now begins to announce the glory of the light that's on the inside because you've turned down the bar youve turned down the the the you know pornography youve turned down all kinds of things the light hidden On th inside is now beginning to bring forth its own glory and that glory is your lived life amen hey the scripture says oh House of Jacob Come Ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord isn't that wonderful House of Jacob come here and let us walk in the light of the Lord so it takes the eye of God to see through the verses of clay and see the unveiling glory on the side of them hallelujah hallelujah when you don't serve the eye of God you cannot see the glory of God unveiling itself in your brother it takes the eye of God the eye of a man will not see God shining on the ins side of you amen that's the eye of a man we are going to understand it as we go back because this is an unveiling Glory it's a growing glory amen praise the Lord and you know when you put a seed in the ground you can sit from morning to evening but you never see how it grows but it's growing anyway praise the Lord because one time it was one foot another time it will be two feet but you'll sit and you watch and you say this time I must see you squeeze your eyes but you never see the trie growing but it's growing anyway and I want to say it's only the eye of God that can see how you are growing because that seed is on your inside oh praise the lord it's an unveiling Glory a growing Glory that will finally push his glorious presence amen finally it comes out just like it was on the dedication of the Tabernacle of Moses oh praise God that light that was in the h of hly finally pushed out and he started to hang upon the Tabernacle until the morning and that light could only be seen because it cleared the darkness I know you are walking in some dark spots amen but I want to say this the light of God is here to clear all your du SP and then hang over you and the Nations will see there is the light over that Tabernacle amen the light pushed through the BG skin amen the BG skin amen that were actually the uh CS of the holy of holies and penetrated through until the world was able to see that I want to prophesy that before we leave Hallelujah everyone will have an opportunity to shange that [Music] life there must come your manifestation as a Son of God I want say that your light will be seen because God cannot light a candle permanently keep it under the bush of your human body that light will have to come out your light will be your testimony in public they will say something is happening with that son or daughter of God just like the song writer say I let my little light shine are you going to let your little light amen and brother Bram says light is on the side of you as small as a button of a sh that light there is the still Small Voice it's not so loud Small Voice which tells you don't go that route don't go that rout and then brother Bram says but it grows and begins to crowd all the darkness amen yes sir I want say something here and I want you to understand that if a man was commissioned to write the story of David because he has human eyes he would write like the red paper they go in Parliament parament and they read the budget they read but then the following day when they bring out the paper they are not talking about figures they are talking about a sleeping Minister a sleeping MP those are the pictures which come out are you together with me so if that's the eye of a man when told to write your story you are scoring 75% but they write the 25% man will emphasize where you still fail but God will emphasize where you are standing right that's the nature and character of God that's the way he spoke to the seven Church ages he kept talking about their successes and then just at the bottom here then he says but I have one thing against you but after appreciating the 75 but the eye of man will only write about the 25 and we encouraged that God recognizes every little thing we have overcome that's where you are writing your own history if a man has right your history he the 25% where you still fail amen if a man is commissioned to write the story of David he would not be patient until he sees that Solomon has established the om and pass it over to his son Solomon he will not be patient is the eye of a man and there's no long suffering to the eye of a man amen he talk about David how he killed a man for his wife he talk about David when he did not go to war and then he was just relaxing home and got involved with somebody's wife that's the eye of a man but the eye of God has long suffering and I want to say God will be patient with you your story is [Music] perfect you just need to BU yourself in the world study the word pray about your condition God knows you don't say Lord you know my weaknesses just mention what your problem is that's how you are going to get your deliver amen oh hallelujah hallelujah if his thought record the story of Abraham he said this man was UN he fa to in the face of the famine and fled to Egypt and yet that's exactly in Genesis 12 when he had just stepped into the landine they'll talk about H they talk about is man will say that amen even after his new B in Genesis 17 he still failed and went to to J amen man we look at Abraham's failure Amen to understand the promise when you know to miss the weakness when he SED a child with Huger but when God looked at Abraham he looked at him after the fight is over he a god of long suffering and when God looked at Abraham he says that his Ted not at the promises of God Amen he T noten I believe that am natural struggles there is a deid on the side of you a man after God's Own Heart are you together with me yes sir praise the Lord that David On th side will not die until you bring forth Solomon which is divine stability to the kingdom of your body a man will have control over the kingdom amen you are going to produce your Solomon to bring down all the enemies that surround your kingdom did you hear what I say amen and again I know you will grow into a temple of Glory amen there's something in you that only God can understand it's only Christ who understood the mystery that laid behind Peter's you know unguided zeal [Music] because he was on fire of everything but in everything Peter was making mistakes and then he would be rebuked be behind me Satan then he comes back again then another thing and everything was wrong but God is the only one who understood Peter and he says when you are converted strengthen your brethren I want to tell you this morning God understands you better than even you understand yourself there's an unfolding mystery in you that's why you must write your own history just be like a Peter drop your Zeal don't stay away from the master you know me they called me a devil okay let him go with those ones who are not devils and then the following day you are not in church you must have a seal Hallelujah God knows and when these negatives are being saved it's not Peter he's talking to the seven but even if you preach a strong gospel and you preach hard and rough you can never preach a one elect Hallelujah an elect will always remain Hallelujah when now go back when he says go back he was not talking truth no sir amen he was only talking to who is that so when you come to church when you are a seed of God whatever you hear and how you hear we always be postive amen you see a n SE will always negatively interpret things that are saying [Music] but the SE when they don't understand they would take the master away and they say master tell us the the par of the S they are not going to become Negative they go back to the world and they are going to deep and they are going to until the master will reveal to them whatever he met whenever we come down here to preach there is something the Lord wants to say to you and if you don't understand don't be like the rest of the people and said this is a hard saying you should be like the 12 disciples amen when he ask them will you also go away you say no whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life we need to be positive amen oh yes sir don't allow external criticism to destroy your unfolding Glory because one thing which I know you are still in the pters house Hallelujah hallu he may break you today and make you a little halfway and then he finds out that you have to be broken again I don't care how many times you are broken but as long as you are still in the prot at the end of the day you are going to produce a ver of Honor that's what we are here for to a ver of Honor amen just hang out there in the Porter's hands amen God saw something in you and is the one who placed it in that body and he must strug and find until that which is On th side will his glory on the outside and you will walk as a Victorious Christian in area yes where you used to go to the night club and let them say there goes the light of God tell your brother I overcome we shall overcome you see the prophet told us he did not call them from Egypt to destroy them in the wilderness he delivered them to give them a possession and that's what you are here for you are not a tourist in the wilderness tell the devil I'm not a in the wildness I will make it amen the prophet says how can I take a CO and make a grain of wheat out of it because these are things which are not possible because these bodies here they are coas they are products of a union amen of I mean of I mean of Eve and The Serpent and then out of there I want say it very well that you may understand it that when the serpent got an opportunity with Eve then you know Cain was born they went on the other side and then the Seed of Abraham will stayed in the west but as they kept multiplying the sons of God so the daughters of men and now when they mix the seed could no longer be told by the physical flesh are you together with me it can never anymore so this is a hybrid body that's why it cannot go to heaven The Way It Is God PS out the seed the soul and takes it into theop and then the body dies and for it to go to heaven it has to be spoken back into creation into the Rapture and that purifies you but in this form here it's a hybrid body that cannot go to heaven the way it is unless it go through the Rapture which is the body change are you together with me yes sir this body here will always be your trouble that's why brother Bram says how can I take a CO this hybrid body and make a grain of wheat out of it he says it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside of that Co has to be transmitted from J called weak life amen he says this is here there's no way you can turn them amen praise the Lord into which the only thing God does is to take the wheat jam and put it in this Co here hallelujah hallelujah and when it's planted Amen in death it brings back the life of the whe On th oh hallelujah hallelujah we do not know what we shall be but when he appears we shall be like yes there is something on the side of you and that's what writes your story Hallelujah because it's a nature of God amen he says the only way it can be is because inside that Co has been transmitted from a CO to a jam called wheat life amen then you bu that Co and it will produce a grain of wheat amen because there has been a life a wheat on the inside of the co and the life of the co has been taken out but the nature of the hallelujah hallelujah at this present moment the nature of the co still sticks and it will be until this new life F been devolved out of the ground and raised up as long as you in this Co there are certain little feelings that you are going to have maybe about your husband maybe about your wife maybe about your friend about the church those little feelings but deep Down On th there is a j of great life Hallelujah you can run away from the Brotherhood but the J on the inside keeps bringing you back because this is where your people are the people you are going to enjoy etern to we not out there they are here the one next to you is your brother is your sister but what you see is the problem of the co nature and God will deal with it until every one of you will write your own story amen you feel a c to Holiness in yourself because on the inside of your Co inside that wickedness there is a we life that keeps pushing through just look behind the yes that you have moved and you start saying hey those years behind if this happen two years ago you also know there is something changing on the side so you are a seed on the side that will always have battles with the co amen when Nature on the outside and these battles are unique amen they are not the same your battles are different and my battles are different amen the same Faith but different battles different battles that we go through amen oh abr's battles were different the battles of Moses were different the battles of De were different but the power behind that victory was the same Faith so the challenge of Enoch and Abraham and Moses were different amen you know and when when you would get these men together they would say what are you trying to say me I was in the land you just crying about little child when the three Hebrew children abroad say what are you saying I'm telling you they put up a far furnace and it was lit seven times until the Flames killing people around us and they threw us there what are you talking about and this is what happens we always criticize one another because this man here is crying over little things this man here he has not even come to my level our paths are different every man must write hisory amen they would point at each other's crying points as just weakness so stability is Joseph seeing himself in a throne 13 years after the pit hallelujah hallelujah 13 years after the pit looking at the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus keep growing keep ascending praise God Amen that's Paul now he says Brethren I count not myself to have [Music] apprehended amen but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth onto those things which are before us that's the way we need to move don't keep your eyes behind the victories you had thank God for but there are more battles to fight amen and all Christians have got those great areas in their [Music] lives and Paul call those areas deserting scenes [Music] amen they just come and everyone you talk to a brother and then it'ss do you think you are you not do like that besting SE areas that torment us let's go to Hebrews 12 you must write your Victory amen Hebrews 121 where for seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses [Music] so many witnesses and they were detailed in Hebrews 11 so many witnesses witnesses [Music] witnesses amen you talk about Abel you talk about Enoch you talk about Abraham and the others mentioned in Hebrews 11 they are louds because they are numerous they didn't bring all of them out because they are many they don't talk about sha there are so many and then Paul says a cloud of witnesses when you overcome you join the club of the witness hallelujah hallelujah you become a CL part of the club of the witnesses they testify of the power of God that makes people in their different battles of life so he says we have got these clouds they our examples we have seen how they overcame so let us aside everywh and the sin which so easily beset us and let us run with patience it's not 100 me now but we run a marathon with that one you run with patience amen the rest that is set before us so let us lay [Music] aside that easily Bes to be set is to continually attouch a man yours might be temper and another man is struggling with something different and many times the man with temp he doesn't know that is equally weak like a man who is a [Music] li that that one are you together with me this morning he says let us lay aside amen verse 12 I mean two looking after you set aside look unto Jesus the O and fin of our faith for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God hallelujah praise God for the joy that was set before him Joseph and you the pit and you at the life in prison are you together with me for the Jo that was set before him so we need to pray and come to the understanding of the mystery of God for our lives you say Lord reveal to me what my position is in the body and the moment you see your position you are not going to rest until you get there so whatever trial you go through despising the sh despise the hardships I'm suffering today but God has set something special for me ahead of me so the eyes must be kept on the go as we fight our besetting sins and these sins differ one from another amen we shall just go to the book of Galatians 5 and verse 19 these are the works of the flesh amen they are so besetting amen everyone as I speak knows his area of battle now the works of the flesh are manifest verse 19 which are these adultery fornication uncleanness Las uhuh okay witchcraft hatred variance emulations emulations you know is the desire to be like you lose the focus and you've got a there for you emulations Isaiah had to be like Jesus is our example brother James told that amen wrath stri seditions hes murders drunkness reing and such like I've not said them all Paul says and such like amen and it's the nature of man when he's suffering from this kind of condition to put his weakness on somebody [Music] I have been in church but people of that church failed me they put their mistakes and failures on somebody else and that's the nature of man when God asked Adam amen Adam said the woman you gave me he said God first of all I didn't have a choice you just gave me this woman and see what she has done but the question is have you eaten of the fruit huh we get in our homes certain things happen a person reacts a certain way when you were talking to him he says you joke with my husband no we are asking have you eaten of the fruit when they went to the woman the woman also says the hallelujah hallelujah Matthew 74 let's just build principles to guide ourselves in the work as a fellowship I'm preaching stability write your own story don't leave it to me don't say the serpent beow me Matthew 74 oh will now say to thy brother let me pull out the mo out of thine eye and behold a beam is in th ey now a m is a blade of grass a m yeah but a beam is a log a log one is a blood of grass but the other one is a log the man who has a l doesn't want to know he has a l he goes to the other has got a let me let me remove this from you see I want to write your story let me remove this this one is making your story wrong but he has a be you see what I mean so in verse five he says Thou hypocrite First cast off the beam of thine own eye and then sh thou See Clearly to cast out the M out of thy brother's eye but as long as you have a beam you will not see properly let us remove the beam in any case what the Lord is saying must concentrate and write your story we all need to be one another's brother but then the first thing what is your story like then it is also the nature of man to look at the failure of another not his own so the best Christian attitude is to so much care for your condition as you care for your brother's amen let's go to John chapter 8 and look at this interesting story are you still there my friends amen verse three says and the scribes and Pharisees brought him a woman taken in adult and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him Master this woman was taken in ad doubt in the very act now Moses in the law commanded us it always comes with a quot did you hear that it comes with a quot even brother Bram say hey so this one say Moses in the Lord commanded us that should be stoned but what do you say so why do you bring her to me if you know what to do they want to Tes him what do you say are you standing very perfect in the law the law would Stone this woman but there is something here that's the eye of a man it will always be selective the woman is CAU in a doubt it's an act of two people where is the man are you together with me wanted to write This Woman's story and not their own and that of the [Music] man because this men who are bringing this man this woman is not because they are perfect they've been in the same condition but they want to write somebody's story you must write your St care for your Christian Life when you come to church Lord speak to me person help me get me out of this area honest with God because Leviticus 20 and verse 10 the scripture says and the man that commit adultery with another man's wife even he that commit adultery with his neighbor's wife the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death but this time we've only brought this woman [Music] are you together with me so Jesus in his response does not encourage sin but he's pointing out to the attitude of the people you see he that is without sin among you let him be the first to cast a stone at her and everyone dropped his Stone and walked away he was trying to deal with the attitude of the people amen yes sir he is encouraging people to deal with their p besetting SE to be as concerned as they are concerned over their so I'm still L the foundation here to deal with Abraham but let us look at the attitude of balak a little bit do you love him Write Your Story help your brother amen Write Your Story help your brother and one of these days I'm coming with the subject help your brother amen so Numbers Chapter 23 it's a bit of a few scriptures to read and he took in verse seven and he took up his Parable and said balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram out of mountains of the East saying come cast me Jacob and come defy Israel [Music] that's now bam but then he says how shall I cast whom God has not cast how shall I defy whom the Lord has not defiled he knows the fact verse n for from the top of the Rocks I see him and from the hills I behold the people shall dwell alone and shall not be recalled among the Nations is looking at the favor God has put upon Israel then he says in verse 10 who can count the dust of Jacob and the number of the fourth part of Israel let me die the death of the right and let my last end be like his now this is he's speaking a par and he says these are very blessed people these are people of the promise this move here you are seeing is God trying to get a pride out of these people and I desire if anything when I die I want to be part of that you see and what has thou done unto me I took the to cast my enemies and behold thou has blessed them all together but the secret is that On th side there was a wheat life that could not be destroyed you see I was telling the people you cannot kill the Shar and have the seed that's what I was telling the people about Israel it doesn't matter how they get buffeted there is no way they can kill the nation and have the 144,000 God will protect them because in there there was a life I used together with me balak was looking at the Shar was looking at the co but on the inside there was a nation there was the line of the Messiah Israel was it was in the history I mean in the process of writing it history but baac chose to defy Israel by the condition that they were fighting are you together with me they chose to defy because Israel was still fighting certain Wicked God have mercy let us fight the battles of our flesh and come to a victory amen listen now this is balac says to Bam come I pray thee with me and another place from where you may see that you see but the at most Thou shalt see them and thou sht see but the atmost part of them and shall not see them all and cast them from there come and I show you the weakness and then cast them but the eye of God you are elect by the eye of God you are a fighter by the eye of God you are UNC Amen brother Bram in the message ey of God he said Jesus said yes Jesus said lo I am with you always even to the end and we are nearing the end then Jesus confirm that guiding eye amen being with him in the days when he revealed himself to the Jews before the ending of that church age for the Jews amen he manifested it looking through the eye of God he did the same thing to the Samaritans and now we go to the Gentiles left and tonight God still looks through that same ey because Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he still look through the eye of God and we can with his grace and sanctifying Power he L us and has called us to be Sons and Daughters he use us as Vine and branches in the vine to still look through the eye of God to see what has been and what will be and will not walk in darkness as long as walk through the eye of God put on the of God before you start the B of your flesh amen the eye of God says one thing you are predestinated after the adoption of children it's a journey and not a destiny amen predestinated you are at this spot here but is the other war between now and that they are battles of the flesh to fight amen and as you walk through all these kind of battles I want to say one thing you are writing your own story amen God loves Spirit God loves holiness amen so according to the good pleasure of his will let's go to Ephesians Ephesians having predestinated D the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good plure of his will it's a journey that has the Red Sea it's a journey that has the Wilderness it's a journey that has got the River Jordan and as you stand you just say he's still working on me is that amen for you he's still working on me if you stay in the Porter's hand you will finally make a verse of Honor are you together with me don't jump from the Porter's heart the breaking is painful sometimes but when the maker is breaking he's breaking you for your own good amen if you st the Porter's hand you finally make the verse of Honor he will take you back to the wheel amen and REM you until you meet the Lord's purpose in your life amen now out of the same CL makes the vessel of honor and makes the Of Dishonor now some vessels of Honor are made straight from the first mold amen but some have broken again and again not because they are not elected but because they are being affected by some spiritual negative spiritual environment amen you see the environment around this vessel causes the mod to go wrong and so God has to take back this vessel into the Porter's house maybe they had a form of ministerial approach amen which was a little bit faulty Maybe maybe they are pulled on a wrong influence somehow maybe the environment where they live affects them maybe the nature of job or business they involved when they almost making a verse of Honor then it's broken again but the master knows why he has to break him the master knows why he takes to Hebrews 12 the master knows why we must be chastised not for our B but for our go praise the Lord the reason you are broken in the hands of the Porter is one it's because you are unelect and he must bring you to your spot of Honor amen he break you over and over until you get out what he wants out of you the quicker you step away from the environment the better it took Israel 40 years in the hands of the P to make a na how many years is it taking taking me God knows but as long as a manone left I'll ask for Grace not to jump from the pter whe amen sometimes is rough but be patient with God Amen now what is this what's that in your hand in that message the prophet says that's the way the people today you don't like to get broke you got to be broke up before you can be remade the prophet went down to the Porter's house to be broken to get on the wheel and to on a wheel amen you know to get something different if you are a sinner get on the wheel God will break you up mold you different shape your life different sh your home different are you willing to go to the P's house this morning and say Lord break me amen so let's go to Revelation 3 and verse 19 I'm almost there let's just be patient Revelation 39 this is the pter now as many as not as many as love me but as many as I love I reuke that's the love of God therefore be zealous and repent amen rebuke and Ching a ways God uses to put us back on the Wheel to form us according to his will that your story is right with the purpose of God for your life he wants you to repent of the for image that you have carried for many [Music] years okay praise the Lord you image and God doesn't like the image and God doesn't like the image for so many years he has been trying to get you put you back to the wheel you jump off the wheel he gets you jump off the but you just be very obedient and say father like the prophet did I'm presenting myself in the Porter's house break me make me because the pter has power over the how many would say I Am The Clay here God is helping you to form you in your own story in Romans 9 verse 21 has not the P power over the and the same lamp to make one vessel honor and another dishonor [Music] verse 12 what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of Wrath fitt to destruction verse 22 Romans 9:22 the next verse verse 23 and that he might make known The Riches of his glory and the Vel ofy in any case for him to have the light glorified there had to be a Darkness for the honor of Moses to be put up here they had to be a pharaoh to highlight Moses as God's ver of Honor he broke the greatest Kingdom that was on the face of the Earth without an army that is God writing his story in Moses there is a story God wants to write amen you see that's why he took Jacob back to the wheel in the house and on the way back he broke his tie giving him a new work and a new name it was God bringing back into the land of his father when he was a new image what is God doing with your is he breaking you up are you crying of pain God knows what is doing is helping you to write your own story our path may not be the same amen Jacob never jumped off the wheel of M he got trapped between the Rock and Hard Place this way amen and is on the other side and in between he couldn't go forward he couldn't go backward he was trapped in between them sometimes we cry Lord why did this happen to simply because God wants you to go in a moment so that you may learn to trust him and him alone he can help you to wait a new St in your life amen listen here Hebrews 121 those who my love I trust him not who love me but those who I love how can we know that God loves us he has given us his life you are saved you committed your sin on the altar you couldn't do that unless God loves you so God loves you so when you go through ch God is helping you to write your story okay now verse Hebrews 121 Paul here is telling you about the pains that's in your life he says now no Ching for the present seeth to be joyous nevertheless afterward it yeld the Peaceable fruit of righteousness them that are exercised thereby so hang in there and write the story are you together with me hanging there broken chased not yet broken CH don't begin to say I don't know it's me it's me that church it's me yeah this journey here you are in it alone when he wants to reform he cannot do it on another person he does it on you until the way you obey WR the story of your life amen the prophet says here there before him lies all mankind as one lamp of clay out of that same lamp he will make some verses to honor and others to dishonor amen now he's talking about man is not talking about church alone but you are part of mankind and you as a Son of God he wants to design you into a of Honor amen he says that choosing will be his own choosing then those choosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their work he reproves him with long suffering and gentleness and mercy he chest with nails cut hands sometimes this poter may take the vessel he's working on and suddenly breaking in order that he may rebuild it exactly desires breaks it up no this side here should have been this side here and then you cry but that's the love of God to he's helping you to write the story of the verse of Honor that you are amen there before him lies mankind as all lamps of so men of character are molded in fire Trials of affliction then we read about their stories we enjoy the story of the character of Jacob who was molded in suffering we enjoy the story of Joseph molded through suffering and these men they give us their story because they never jumped off the wheel they were patient your will be done listen when God calls us he justifies us it's a journey then he sanctifies us and then he baptizes us with the but in the stage of justification we cannot bypass Romans 7 the painful desire to become the better man how many of you say Lord make me better this morning but we can never bypass Romans chapter 7 because in there you always cry out for that which I do I allow not for what I would I do not but what I hate that I do then you come to church and you cry you cannot byass the desire for a better person must become so heavy upon us for us to be able to go into prayer about our journey he says for I know that in me that's in my flesh is no good thing for me to will his present is with me but how per I find not you said now Lord again I'm failing here I'm failing here but deep down on this side you know you are a child of God God give me Grace God give me mercy cry alled man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death at that point God takes you to the pter house breaks you in sanctification points out this points out that you cry and say God have Mer supp but the entire purpose of God is that at the end of it you must be a ver of Honor that's why we are in church not to continue the way we live our life but God to make us vessels of honor and as God breaks us let us pray that we don't jump off the v i mean the wheel The God Who is reaching Mercy amen graduate student Romans 8 there's therefore no condemnation we have stepped into Christ so the journey could belong as the Jour of the Corinthians let me finish on this you know the Corinthians the scripture says in First Corinthians chapter one and verse one it says called to be Saints they were not yet but the call was to make them Saint that's the call God has given called to be sa and now when he calls you you have got a certain character around you that God is working on so that he can get the saint out of you amen so by going by the way the Corinthians were they were called to be Saints but they were still divided along human life I am of Paul I am of seas I am of Apollos they Le on human wisdom and Paul called that foolishness to God they robbed each other amen when this borrowed money never pay amen they took each other cour of law they things sacrific to Idols was immorality to the I mean to the level of incest amen what is yeah amen are you together with me so they relied on natural evidences amen Paul brought them to a higher level of understanding and he started pointing them to the go amen go am and then Paul says I has not seen heard may have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love are you together with him so Paul was laboring with them he was like a pter he break them here M them there break them there m them here PA was patient with them amen so but from Corinthians 9 Corinthians 9 Paul starts to stabilize the church by setting them in order he teaches them the authority he has over them as the Apostle and messenger of the age in First Corinthians 10 he brings the power of the Corinth to the church in the wilderness and they learn to see how the church in the wilderness failed to enter into the promise but the consistent mistakes they did so the Corinthian Church learns to avoid the same mistakes in Corinthians 11 they were Tau the significance of the Lord's table and how to approach it then chapter 12 the gifts were put in order because there were too much in First Corinthians 13 they introduced charity that must stand with ever again now they are going step after step after step to come to a certain level why they were called to be sa so God sees you in the condition where you are but he Calla you to make a sent out of you amen then from chapter 15 God sees the maturity of the crop and then begins to take them on a higher level amen then you know the rest of all the churches he washed them and put them into greater spiritual Fellowship from Canal a highly revelated church that's what God is seeking out of he doesn't want you to remain the way you are he wants to lift you up high enough that you can completely be kept by charity himself and then charity begins to control your life until he give you body change amen you were not called to remain in the condition you were called you were called to be brought before God that God can deal with you as his son he begins to teach them how he teaches them about the resurrection and then he says but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come he's taking them at higher levels he didn't teach the Colossians that he didn't teach the Ephesians he's taking them to a higher level and that's what God has to do with you looking unto him that's the focus he tells them there is one glory of the son there is another glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon and another glory of the stars for one star differ from another in glory so also is the resurrection of the Dead it is swn in corruption is raised in incorruption it is swn in dishonor is raised in glory it is sown in weakness is raised in power is teaching them spiritual things amen Natural Body it is natural body it is you know it's raised the spiritual body he says there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body they have now gained the level that's what God is doing with you he wants you to write your story in First Corinthians the salutation was called to be Saints but in second Coran the salutation is the Church of God which is that Corinth hallelujah hallelujah First Corinthians called to be Saints but second Corinthians the Church of God which is at cor that's how God wants to see along the journey that you have written a story changing character history rad written and now he confides with them into greater things of the spirit that's what God wants to do why do you want to condemn yourself in the condition where you are God didn't call you for you to die in the wilderness you must cross the Jordan and get your position in the body pick your inheritance that I'm a Child of God Amen so they begin to get great Mysteries released to them amen in first 2 Corinthians 5 they are told about the bodies in heaven that are waiting for us when we get out of this he tells them about greater things he talks to them about going beyond the curtain of time I knew of the Man in Christ 14 years ago whether in the body I don't know whether in the spirit I don't know such a one was caught up in the third heaven you know the devil is a liar he keeps telling you the standard the church preaches is too high for you has the dev whispered that to you yeah that's too high for you but you were called and you are on a process to become s the next thing will be the Church of God called The Church of God in Corinth they were called to be but now they are and now they are being called the Church of God the Church of God the Church of God you know you can put yourself there Susan whoever you are God has called you to as higher position in Christ and is bringing you up there with long suffering you must write your own story I don't want to write your story if I was called TR the story of David the eyes of a man they see where a man fails but the eyes of God they see where you fail and as I told you the other day God hides in your weakness to reveal his glory perfect strength in perfect weakness do you desire to be an overcomer amen and God will give that so let's go back to abah a little bit the scriptures we dealt with just be patient a little bit in Hebrews 11 ver8 you see I want us to see how the same Faith amen God would chelate to work differently for men who have been called for different purposes so faith is personal person it is not given generally faith is your individual revelation of the perfect will of God for your life it is strong enough to take you through the channels that Write Your Story it doesn't fail it didn't fail in the first f it didn't fail in the land's Den it doesn't fail it will never fail no child of God will fail to make it every one of you will write a book of Acts there will be a Life of Christ manifested in your life have been called in the condition of CH but at the end of it you are going to get promises he's now telling them that you are going to be changed can you imagine the people that were eating things sacrificed you can write a perfect story okay Hebrews 118 by faith Abraham when he was called to go into a place we should afterward receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing where he was going so here is divine obedience it has nothing for you to adequately understand Divine obedience means start out and wait for instructions are you together with me yeah so these stories here were written one day at a time they were not given a syus hallelujah hallelujah they were not given a syus that Moses when you finish this this will happen this will happen this will happen and then he goes what next no he just obey pick up your stick go into Egypt Moses went now I'm in Egypt whatever challenge came God instructed Moses God will one day at a time instr you until at the end of the day you will write a story of your life the scripture says even Abraham didn't know amen but he just obeyed he went not knowing even where to go but wherever he went turn left turn right turn left turn right go turn left turn at the end of it we have got the story of Abraham God knows what is doing in your life he says in verse 9 by faith and faith is a revelation when day at a time God deals with it amen he Ser in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in the Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob and the hairs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has foundations whose build and maker is God amen are you together with me he had to come out separated from unbelief to be placed in a place where he was going to wait without interruptions and you happy that God has called you he has placed you in a place where you can comfortably wait for your change to come amen he called you out of the Catholics he blessed you here and every time you come more washing Waters more washing Waters more encouragement more encouragement and day after day you say it's better today for me you go back and then you come back again you hear more and then hear more and then you say I've never seen it this way before I'm sure I'm going to make it you see they all now the scripture says they all die amen but they held the vision they held the vision amen they were looking for something and then they had the Revelation it will be either in this land or in that same land but what I know it's there somewhere hallelujah hallelujah praise God it is there somewhere brother you don't have to give up what we are looking for whether in this land or in that land is there somehow the message of the hour is the land where we are waiting for just prepare while you in there you in the message stay right in there stay in line when you feel staggering there's a voice stain line amen then the voice speaks to the ladies that were going up there on that line with their high heels they started to STG out what are you doing with those high heels walking and missing as you go just maintain the picture of the land where you have been called amen just take the the precepts of the word and stay right in there just wash that makeup it will not make you more spiritual amen you are going to be more decent just get that I mean that trous a little wider amen you know you look more decent I know you might be good enough in a figure but you going to look better as the Son of God just make your dress a little wider and a little longer stay the message keep waiting and the more bious is the more the story will become better when you seem like you are going to St away there is a voice stain L stain l write amen your story no man is going to write it for you no man will throw your Victory to you Victory comes after war no man will throw character on you character comes after trial amen you must Write Your Story with that kind of desire in your heart your God will not be shame to identify himself with you because he's responsible for your story do you love him there's this
