[3:00] one more time
[3:04] [Music]
[3:20] foreign
[3:36] [Music]
[3:47] [Music]
[3:51] precious
[3:52] Heavenly Father
[3:55] Lord God we give thanks to you
[3:58] your grace and mercy
[4:01] is that which we have need of Lord
[4:05] because without you we can do nothing
[4:10] we have come back into the house of God
[4:14] father dear Lord God to feed from your
[4:17] word
[4:18] and I pray dear Lord Jesus
[4:21] that you may help me to get out of the
[4:24] way
[4:25] that the spirit of Life himself
[4:28] May minister to your children
[4:31] bless them Lord Jesus
[4:33] take care of their needs father
[4:37] see you their Eternal destination Lord
[4:40] with such a special confidence father
[4:43] that they know that the Lord Jesus who
[4:47] started a good work in them will bring
[4:49] you to completion
[4:51] may you be gracious Lord as you bless us
[4:55] in this service in Jesus name amen
[4:59] you may be seated
[5:04] um
[5:05] this is a very
[5:10] short service
[5:13] but yet very profound
[5:19] I want us to really know
[5:24] that God values
[5:27] what we call marriage
[5:30] marriage in itself is the foundation of
[5:32] life
[5:35] is the foundation of the church
[5:39] a church
[5:40] which has got very weak marriages
[5:44] is a church that has no future
[5:49] so we need
[5:52] to handle this
[5:54] as very profound tonight
[5:59] Maybe
[6:00] before we get into the scripture reading
[6:05] less stand up
[6:08] we shall got First Corinthians chapter
[6:10] 11 verse 3.
[6:13] First Corinthians 11 3.
[6:17] which says but I would have you know
[6:20] that the head of whether a man is Christ
[6:23] and the head of the woman is the man and
[6:28] the head of Christ is God
[6:31] that's a very very profound scripture
[6:36] but I would have you know
[6:38] that the head of the womb of whether a
[6:41] man
[6:42] is Christ
[6:45] and the head of the woman is the man and
[6:49] the head of Christ is God
[6:54] my interpreter is late I don't like you
[6:57] know waiting for people
[7:05] foreign
[7:36] moments of humility in marriage
[7:41] if your way towards it moments
[7:46] of humility in marriage abuse
[7:52] so I've told you for
[7:59] tutored in the Garden of Eden
[8:03] and the purpose was to build
[8:06] God's kingdom here on Earth
[8:11] a spiritual Kingdom
[8:15] amen Amina
[8:18] it was given with a strong blessing
[8:21] multiply
[8:28] and replies
[8:31] and so brother Branham tells us
[8:34] that the multiplication
[8:37] was a spiritual multiplication
[8:41] because this promise here this blessing
[8:46] was given before Adam
[8:50] who was in flesh
[8:54] so he said
[8:57] Adam before sex was ever introduced
[9:04] before sex was ever introduced
[9:09] before sex he was ever introduced
[9:13] sex
[9:15] y
[9:21] amen Amina multiply and replace the
[9:25] earth
[9:27] when it was yet in the beginning
[9:31] when he was yet both male and female in
[9:36] himself
[9:40] that's when he was taught
[9:43] you know multiply
[9:45] and replenish
[9:49] before even they come in flesh
[9:53] before even Eve had come out of the rib
[9:59] of others
[10:02] so it was
[10:04] a spiritual multiplication
[10:07] then the prophet says they assures that
[10:12] the bride has got to come from the World
[10:18] by spiritual multiplication
[10:21] Amen to replenish the Earth
[10:25] so that promise
[10:28] was the promise to build the kingdom
[10:33] and we see that before they could
[10:37] reproduce by the spoken word
[10:41] we see that Adam and Eve
[10:45] [Music]
[10:47] and so that promise had to be suspended
[10:53] until the second Adam would come
[10:57] back
[11:00] by the spoken word
[11:03] so we are born in the family of God
[11:09] by the spoken word
[11:16] [Music]
[11:20] and that's how the spiritual
[11:23] multiplication was supposed to be okay
[11:27] amen Amina then we see that Adam and Eve
[11:31] became separate bodies
[11:35] holding that promise
[11:37] they needed to maintain a particular
[11:40] quality
[11:42] in order to bring to pass that spiritual
[11:46] promise
[11:49] are you together with me and so Adam
[11:53] then
[11:54] gets into his marriage
[11:57] after God had approved his maturity
[12:03] foreign
[12:16] [Music]
[12:30] [Music]
[13:18] [Music]
[13:23] when you have been baptized
[13:47] he becomes the spiritual security of his
[13:52] house
[13:55] and is the foundation of the spiritual
[13:58] growth of that family
[14:02] spiritual security
[14:04] and spiritual Foundation
[14:08] that upon his understanding of the word
[14:13] there's family here
[14:16] is going to be founded
[14:19] in a strong situation
[14:22] amen amen at home
[14:26] the man assumes the son of pastors
[14:31] to continue watering the seeds
[14:35] which are planted during the services of
[14:38] the church
[14:40] that's what a man is there foreign
[14:45] [Music]
[15:13] she encountered a teacher
[15:16] and yet we know that in scripture
[15:19] the Bible says whatsoever you've not
[15:23] understood
[15:26] husband at home
[15:30] but eve took a decision
[15:33] before she could ask the husband
[15:37] if he bypass her spiritual security yes
[15:44] and she built on a false Foundation yes
[15:50] praise the Lord I appreciate God
[15:54] for the audience at least
[15:57] of the married people of church
[16:01] thank you clap for yourselves
[16:06] you see
[16:08] at home
[16:10] the man becomes the pastor
[16:14] of the family um
[16:17] how does he become part of the family
[16:21] by watering the sea Rocky Williams that
[16:25] have been planted
[16:27] during the services
[16:30] that's why you husbands must be very
[16:34] good students of the world
[16:39] it will be very dangerous
[16:42] if the wife at home
[16:44] understands the world better than you
[16:50] Stephen you have heard that
[16:53] praise the Lord to become very good
[16:57] students of the world
[17:00] that's why Paul says of the sisters
[17:05] in First Corinthians chapter 14.
[17:12] and if they will learn anything meaning
[17:16] the sisters
[17:21] [Music]
[17:43] [Music]
[17:46] he says that because he knows
[17:50] that a man who gets married
[17:53] must first of all have a spiritual
[17:55] maturity
[17:58] amen so if you lack into your spiritual
[18:02] maturity
[18:04] it's very necessary from this meeting
[18:08] you go start burying yourself in the
[18:11] tapes
[18:14] you go and listen to what the message
[18:16] says
[18:17] because you are the spiritual security
[18:22] and you are the spiritual Foundation
[18:26] of your family
[18:29] so under this knot
[18:32] the husband is the pastor
[18:35] of the house when and to learn properly
[18:39] a good atmosphere must be maintained at
[18:42] home
[18:43] [Music]
[18:45] and the husband must be a good student
[18:50] and maintain a very good found I mean
[18:54] atmosphere
[18:56] amen Amina that the reason atmosphere of
[19:00] worship
[19:02] there is an atmosphere praise
[19:05] amen there is an atmosphere which is
[19:09] holy at home while you were made
[19:11] [Music]
[19:12] amen amen remember now in the family of
[19:17] Abraham Ibrahim there was an atmosphere
[19:22] and worship is not only the songs we
[19:26] sing
[19:28] but worship
[19:34] [Music]
[19:40] we don't have shouting matches
[19:43] [Music]
[19:51] [Music]
[19:54] no you maintain an atmosphere worship
[19:59] you see many times
[20:03] when you've been talking
[20:05] maybe sexual things
[20:08] how we visited so and soon then they say
[20:12] okay let us pray before we pass
[20:15] there is a moment of silence
[20:20] you are changing dimensions
[20:25] you see what I mean you are changing
[20:28] Dimensions
[20:29] you are trying to make yourself
[20:33] to enter into state that can pray
[20:37] and I desire that we stay that that kind
[20:41] of state most of the time
[20:45] [Music]
[20:51] the house of lot in reality a dent of
[20:56] the atmosphere of worship
[20:59] and brother Branham says that they were
[21:03] always having those hooky bookies
[21:08] and so no angel would visit them
[21:12] but the atmosphere in the house of
[21:15] Abrams
[21:19] Elohim and fellowship with I mean
[21:22] Abraham yes that's what God did
[21:26] so under this
[21:32] must keep a clean atmosphere at home
[21:38] you must have enough words
[21:41] [Music]
[21:44] to negotiate the storms in marriage
[21:49] because holy marriages
[21:51] foreign
[21:55] [Music]
[22:16] [Music]
[22:23] [Music]
[22:54] [Music]
[23:04] [Music]
[23:20] are you together with me that's what I'm
[23:23] calling humility
[23:26] in marriage
[23:28] moments of humility
[23:30] in humility I mean in the marriage like
[23:34] there was a man in the land of rules
[23:37] [Music]
[23:40] and that man was perfect
[23:43] that money was Uprising
[23:47] that man feared to God
[23:51] there was nothing you could Point
[23:54] against
[23:56] that situation
[23:58] [Music]
[24:03] you see you cannot keep away trials
[24:08] in your marriage
[24:10] but these trials require moments of
[24:14] surgery
[24:25] [Music]
[24:28] simply because he was perfect before God
[24:33] you must learn
[24:35] some of these trials
[24:40] because the devil is not happy
[24:43] with the perfect condition of the home
[24:51] then he is going to blow a storm
[24:56] and if we don't put in the chair of
[25:00] humility
[25:03] then we are headed to a separate all
[25:07] right
[25:09] amen Amina you're not trials have
[25:13] nothing to do with the sin no judgment
[25:15] it says
[25:17] it's not that because you've done this
[25:21] then destroy your cows
[25:25] foreign
[25:43] [Music]
[26:01] but the challenge
[26:04] is how do we react to these challenges
[26:10] [Music]
[26:13] and some of them
[26:15] are like the curse
[26:19] of jobs
[26:23] sometimes whatever just comes in
[26:25] obviously understand and destroys the
[26:28] wealth yes yes
[26:31] [Music]
[26:32] your business begins to crumble yeah
[26:36] you start wondering what am I going to
[26:39] do
[26:40] sometimes celebrity the devil just come
[26:44] and touch your health
[26:48] and then the peace is gone
[26:51] sometimes celebrity the job is lost
[26:55] and it becomes a challenge
[26:58] and sometimes they are situations
[27:01] [Music]
[27:07] we have been married five years we don't
[27:12] have the child
[27:29] a child doesn't come by one person
[27:35] you'll find a situation where you're
[27:37] gonna name better pastor we have the
[27:39] problem somebody will obviously we don't
[27:41] have the son he said
[27:45] and that also begins to become uh
[27:49] uh a storm in the marriage
[27:56] we don't have the daughter
[27:59] and then because they are looking for
[28:01] adults
[28:02] two children three children one of us
[28:06] are four children five children but I
[28:09] know
[28:11] eventually seven children probably
[28:13] Muslim
[28:15] then they get a gown
[28:18] but after some time I remember Etc then
[28:21] the means to keep the family together
[28:27] you are looking for a girl
[28:30] but you did not know you were
[28:32] multiplying
[28:34] that demands that will come with the
[28:37] seven of your daughter
[28:42] you see what I mean we should come to a
[28:46] form of humility sometimes everything we
[28:48] know quite ourselves and accept what God
[28:51] has allowed to be in our life
[28:56] brother Branham says then the God is
[28:59] obligated to a man
[29:02] who will stand like that
[29:05] he let him go right down to the last
[29:09] person
[29:11] even to his wife come out right
[29:16] away
[29:19] why don't you cast God and die right
[29:22] we're gonna turn our far just to think
[29:25] his own wife turned against him
[29:29] and because someone will turn against us
[29:34] and think that we are from your heart
[29:36] hello
[29:38] funny oh oh yeah
[29:41] amen amen all God's people but
[29:45] are funny
[29:47] amen you are the peculiar people
[29:52] offering sacrifices to God
[29:54] the fruits of your lips giving praise to
[29:58] his name
[30:00] now what we're not that even job's wife
[30:04] [Music]
[30:10] why don't you cast God and that right
[30:13] we're gonna
[30:14] foreign
[30:43] foreign are you together with him
[30:46] situations come everybody that is
[30:49] sickness comes anyway they don't tends
[30:52] to become permanent
[30:54] yes
[30:58] you've got this pastor
[31:01] and prayed with him
[31:03] you've made calls
[31:06] two different pastors to pray over the
[31:10] situation
[31:12] and then job's wife
[31:14] just stands out
[31:16] how long shall I keep with a husband
[31:19] like this
[31:22] just as good and that
[31:27] moments of humility
[31:29] in marriage
[31:32] those things come
[31:34] especially when we begin to Edge
[31:38] brother Stephen I don't know whether
[31:40] he's here organized
[31:43] okay praise the Lord you know things
[31:47] begin to come
[31:48] because
[31:51] it is my argument
[32:01] things begin to come
[32:04] [Music]
[32:06] they never tend to leave
[32:11] you wake up in the morning
[32:16] and then sometimes maybe the sister is
[32:19] still in a better form everybody
[32:28] foreign
[32:36] this is something you can't come
[32:41] it just requires moments of humility
[32:46] that we hold oh we carry one another's
[32:49] body
[32:53] amen Amina yeah it's during this
[32:57] difficult times
[32:59] that we need him
[33:01] amen amen this kind of situation
[33:05] should help us to cling together do you
[33:08] know
[33:09] so that our prayers
[33:14] [Music]
[33:17] because the more we pass
[33:20] in the times
[33:27] [Music]
[33:30] each time
[33:32] we keep separating ourselves
[33:36] we are actually blocking channels of
[33:39] praise
[33:47] when the job condition enters the door
[33:52] of your house
[33:55] [Music]
[33:58] amen because if you scatter while the
[34:03] Singham songs you can't overcome the
[34:05] situation
[34:09] foreign
[34:12] [Music]
[34:25] [Music]
[34:52] and this one thinks Ronaldo the other
[34:55] one is better the other one this one is
[34:59] better
[35:02] so now the man says
[35:07] [Music]
[35:14] [Music]
[35:21] nobody is ready to understand the other
[35:23] yes
[35:25] moments of humility towards it
[35:29] in our marriages are necessary
[35:33] this kind of situation
[35:36] should help us to killing together
[35:41] First Peter chapter three but it is
[35:47] Sarah
[35:48] obeyed Abraham
[35:53] calling him Lord
[35:56] whose daughters
[35:59] as long as you do well

[36:09] [Music]
[36:10] the victory in this family
[36:14] because they didn't have the child
[36:16] one of the big problems that separate
[36:19] people
[36:21] but still Sarah

[39:15] like she fears
[39:19] and the God desires that we maintain
[39:24] what form of relations

[41:06] yeah you know then the husband let him
[41:10] go free
[41:14] you know all of a sudden you've entered
[41:18] into moments of worship
[41:26] then the sister comes down

[42:21] foreign
[42:26] [Music]
[42:47] [Music]
[42:58] amen Amina jobs friends
[43:02] who do not understand the situation
[43:06] and the wife who understood
[43:09] did not understand the power of prayer
[43:12] and the patience
[43:15] sometimes
[43:17] and it stays longer than it should stay
[43:20] away
[43:22] what job's wife needs is to understand
[43:26] the power problems
[43:29] [Music]
[43:31] we need to keep our families together
[43:35] and when you have those kind of problems
[43:38] those are your best times
[43:49] [Music]
[44:03] [Music]
[44:09] it glued us together
[44:14] I was out there
[44:16] amen Amina during those days where it
[44:19] was I mean the worshiping in there
[44:23] and when my daughter would go into
[44:26] crisis
[44:32] and then I was going to be teaching on
[44:35] CEOs
[44:36] I was carrying a series

[44:48] today
[44:50] difficult time she said I'm disabled but
[44:53] you can't take them away
[44:57] I wonder why
[44:59] families
