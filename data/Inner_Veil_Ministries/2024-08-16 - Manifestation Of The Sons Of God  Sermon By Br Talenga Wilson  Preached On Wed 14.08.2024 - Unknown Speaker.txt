========================================

Verse 18 8 verse 18 says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US for the Hest expectation of the creature wait for the manifestation of the sons of God for theature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation grth and travaileth in the pain together and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our body amen amen may the Lord bless his word we may be seated amen the manifestation of the sons of God manifestation of the children of God amen amen do you love him amen the scripture says that the suffering of this present and not worth to be compared with the glory which which shall be revealed in us so the scripture gives us hope that someday there is a glory that hides on the inside of us that shall be revealed there is a glory on the inside of us that shall be brought to manifestation praise the Lord for the honest expectation of the creature wait for the manifestation of the sons of God so now throughout all through all the tribulation and the sufferings of this present time the Bible says when the children of God are to be manifested at the time of manifestation of the sons of God the glory that shall be made manifest the glory that shall come out of us to be manifest the rest of the world the Bible says the sufferings are not even an inch of that Glory praise the Lord for the title tonight taking a trip on the manifestation of the sons of God the manifestation of children of God in the end times praise the Lord so what is to manifest to manifest means to display it means to reveal or to make something evident to make something clear to make something visible it involves bring something that may have been hidden something that has been internal or not yet fully realized into a state where it is clearly perceived reced or understood praise the Lord remember the scripture said that the enti nature is gring waiting for the manifestation of the children of God praise the Lord and the first scripture told us that there is a glory a glory on the inside that shall be made manifest in the end of times so now to manifest That Glory that sits on theide of us means that that Glory all that life all that nature at some point in time shall have to be seen plainly shall have to be made visible the rest of the people see praise the Lord for example in the context of the Bible in the scripture where we read the manifestation of the sons of God would refer to the Future event God is children will be clearly revealed recognized in their glorified State showing who they truly are in Christ and this manifestation will make evident the full transformation and Redemption that God has accomplished in them we shall know who we are for we shall see who he who is and when we look at him shall be able to see him that he shall be like who we are why because when you go back to the Book of Genesis God was creating man God created man in his own image in the likeness of God created he him Lord so God created man in his own image the glory of God in the likeness of God and along the way when man sin he lost the glory of God he lost the likeness of God he lost the life of God praise the Lord but now we know that when Jesus comes he comes to to that which man lost he comes that Glory which man lost in Adam praise the Lord And now when he comes he comes to pay the price on Calvary and he dies praise the Lord and his death and his suffering was the restoration of the glory that we had lost in Adam praise the Lord And now when he's taken up to Glory the Bible says he was against sin of the Angels coming down praise the Lord so now the same God who gave up himself upon the day of Calvary is the same that left the throne sin of the angels and now he came down on the day of Pentecost to live among his people praise the Lord that's why the Bible says for God so love the world that he gave up his only begotten son that whoever believeth on him praise the Lord shall not die but shall have everlasting life so now the life of God the life of Jesus Christ which was given unto us on on the of P to live in US gives us that everlasting life now the Bible has said that there is coming a time of the full manifestation That Glory that lives on the inside of us and now the Bible says that the sufferings that we go through canot be compared That Glory that shall be made manifest in our lives praise the Lord now the manifestation of the children of God is the period in time when the Pure Life Of God that sits at the theme of his Tabernacle praise the Lord that sits on the inside of his Tabernacle in the innermost part of it like we saw last week the three courts that make up the Tabernacle of God Bible tells us that you that I that we are the Tabernacle of God praise the Lord so now we know that the fullness of God dwells within the Tabernacle of God and now the manifestation of the sons of God will come at a time when that God that sits at the theme of his Tabernacle praise the Lord shall make his way out to be known to the rest of the world that's when the whole world will see and the Bible says when they shall see when they shall see us they will be able to see God why he has walked worked his way out to make a manifestation so the high priest of our confession moving from the innermost Court declaring salvation declaring salvation declaring victory that you look at the present time you look at the pain and the sufferings that you're going through they were all finished at Calvary praise the Lord is God on the inside of us trying to make his way out as he makes his way out he makes a declaration that whatever we are going through at the present of time it was all FAL Calvary cannot be compared to the glory that shall come praise the Lord so now that manifestation is in other words a reflection a manifestation of the true nature of God through his children it is God himself manifesting his nature his character through his children such that when the people look at us they are not seeing us they are able to see the likeness of God in us they able to see the image of God in us they able to see the life of God in us a pure reflection and manifestation of the life of God in us praise the Lord God bringing the seat that was once planted in Us in two mon praise the Lord so that brings God into manifestation when we begin to portray the nature of God it brings God into manifestation it brings the image and likeness of God into manifestation it makes us like him and that's what makes us the word put on flesh he lives within us and he makes his way out to manifest the world that he lives in us the Bible says he's not in heaven he left the heavens and now he created a tabernacle Tabernacle that is likened the Tabernacle that Solomon built him praise the lord we saw that there are three courts we have the outermost Court which is the body which must be purified and brought into subjection of the word of God by the preaching of the word praise the Lord it gets into subjection praise the Lord on the day of Pentecost there were certain of them there were certain of them that still lost in the world and when he had come and he was ready to make himself and ab in this Tabernacle there those that had not yet come come into countenance of that Glory so when Peter stood out and he began to preach and he began to rebuke prise the Lord their bodies the outermost Court into sub and the Bible says they were praked in their hearts and they were sighing and they said unto Peter and the rest of the disciples men and Breen what shall we do to receive of this Glory what does that mean outmost part of the Court had come into subjection of the praise the Lord it had come into obedience and it was yearning to open up the door the outer court for the high priest to enter praise the Lord and the B says when they open their doors as the high priest entered he began now to do the work he began do the process of cleansing of sanctifying Praise the Lord he got to their hearts he go to their spirits and he began to wash praise the Lord the more they kept themselves in the presence of God in the preaching of the word the Bible says it is the Waters of the words that was us the preaching of the word of God cleanses us it washes us and it makes us clean and before him praise the Lord that is God Jesus Christ our high priest now in the middle court cleansing Us by the preaching of the Waters of the word praise the Lord And now when he's done and the spirit has come into subjection of the word of God proceeded to the innermost Court we saw last week the holy of holies the theme of The Tabernacle of God the dwelling place of the Tabernacle of God where he lives praise the Lord and when he gets in there that is going to be our starting point tonight that when he gets in there praise the Lord he is like a seed that has been planted in the ground when the seed is planted in the ground the farmer his interest is not to get his seed bur it in the ground and leave it there the farmer has the expectation he has the hope that someday the SE which she has burried in the ground shall bring forth fruits of the same kind praise the Lord so now when the high priest Jesus Christ the word of God gets in our souls the process of transformation begins the process of confirmation begins he now begins confir he conforms us to his word he conforms us to obedience to his word and then the process of manifestation of manifestation of the seed of manifestation of the life that is in the seed begins from there so now we notice that there is no way we can show the manifestation of the life of God unless un unless the life of God has found its way from the outermost Court our spirit then to the soul until we have the word in our souls we can never manifest the life and likeness of God praise the Lord that's why the Bible says behold I stand at the door and knock I stand at the door are knock praise the Lord he knocks because he wants us to respond he knows that he has brought salvation he wants to save us praise the Lord his desire us to save us but he knows that first of all we must bring our bodies unto subjection so he stands at the door knock by way of the at the day of Pentecost he was knocking those men they were calling Peter and the rest of the Apostles they called them drunkers praise the Lord but when the word was preached it condemn their hearts condemn their lives so they had to surrender by opening up their doors for the high priest to enter let's open our doors for the high priest to enter so that he can move through the the outer door to the middle court to the holy of holies to begin the work of confirmation to confir us to transform us to change us work upon us to get us into subjection of the word of God he says to the world they will not be able to see me but you that has opened the door praise the Lord he says you that have believed you shall be able to see me the world will see me no more but you shall be able to see me John 14 ver yet a little while the world sees me no more but yet see me because I live you shall live also praise the Lord let God help us to know that he lives in US recognize that he is alive in our lives that he's alive at every moment of Our Lives to help us believe that the sufferings of the present time cannot be compared to the victory that awaits us to the world we are not able to see him but to us we able to see him because he lives in us and because he lives in us he says you shall live also and that and that day you shall know the day of the manifestation of the sons of God you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you why because when we shall see him we shall see him because he shall be like us we have created in his own image in his likeness so you shall see him we shall see that he is like Us Praise the Lord that's why he says you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you he that loveth my Commandments he that has my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father I will love him and I will manifest myself to him I will manifest myself to him at every moment of life I will manifest myself to him in moments of happiness I will manifest myself to him in moments of trouble I will manifest myself to him praise the Lord in moments of abundance I I will manifest myself to him in moments of lack I will manifest myself to him in moments of life I will manifest myself to him and in moments of sickness I will still manifest myself to him as a Healer he that lovees me I will also love him praise the Lord God making himself manifested before his sons and in so doing manifesting the sons of God in the end times now this manifestation can be likened seed that is planted into the ground it must meet conditions and go through a process of time to be able to crop up into matur and bear fruits to man to manifest the life that the seed once had praise the Lord God planted his life in us and in the end time that life must manifest at the harest time at the time of the end time at the time of the Rapture the same life that he planted in our souls must be the same life that shall manifest with that is a manifestation of the sons of God so we can liken this manifestation the SE that is planted and Jesus spoke a parable in the book of MTH from verse and he spoke many things unto them in saying behold went forth to and when he s some seeds fell by the way side and the fs came and div them up and some fell upon stoy places where they had not much Earth and for with they sprang up because they had no deepness of the Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withed away remember we are likened the life that we have praise the Lord the Salvation that we have is likened this city the Bible said some fell on Stone places that was not a good ground so when they attempted to grow they withered because of the sun their Roots were not deep but the Bible sayto them that love him the Sons The Suffering the scoring of the son the drought and and all the distress cannot be compared to the glory to the life that shall be made manifest praise the Lord so that means the sons regardless of the scoring of the son as long as we are planted on the good ground Our Roots are deep prise the Lord and if the roots are deep we shall be able to stand the test of time and it shall come until that day of the manifestation of the son of and some fell among thorns and THS up and chocked them but other fell into good ground and brought fourth fruit some fell into good ground and the says and those that fell into good ground they brought forth fruit some 100 verse par of the when anyone Hearth the word of the Kingdom and understand understand it not then cometh the wicked one and catches away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way site both he that received the seed in two Stone places the same is he that Hearth the word and and known with joy receives it yet he not root in himself but for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word and remember that's the reason why when God was creating man praise the Lord when God was creating this Tabernacle he had to have a sacred place he had to have a place to hide his word in there praise the Lord because when the body goes into suffering the body can EAS reject the words because of the persecution and distress and the pain that we go through the sickness and troubles and Sorrows sometimes we come short of the of strength and we become weak but because there is a life in our soul that life for TRS from the inside out give us hope that there is life beyond the suffering that there is life beyond sickness the life that God puts on the inside of us is that seed of life praise the Lord so now even if there is persecution even if there is distress we are not offended we cannot hate God we cannot reject his words why because that life on theight is God himself praise the Lord so he cannot reject himself praise the Lord he has made in us that's why he says he is in us and we are in him and when we are in him he brings this body subjection of his word praise the Lord he says that one that that is growing up in the th ground when Trouble Comes and he gets offended praise the Lord when the word is being preached at that point of uh of uh the cleansing process of sanctification he may not be able to Bear the words praise the Lord because now it's no longer concerning the body there are no promises your flesh praise the Lord you have gotten the sickness you've got sickness you've been prayed for you have prayed but you're not recovering praise the Lord if you don't have the words rooted in your soul you can easily reject God and take the alternative but if a man has the word of God if a man has that hope that glorious hope of his resurrection regardless of the suffering of the body he has hope and he can never reject the word of God is brought under subjection of the word because the word has found AB in his heart he that receiveth seed among among that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that Hearth the word understands it which also be beareth fruit and bring forth some 100f Psalm 6sm and we are that seed you are that seat I am that seat praise the Lord and the word of God is the good ground we are planted into the word of God the good ground praise the Lord which is the word of life the life of Jesus Christ himself and the Bible says in John 1 verse4 the word was made flesh and dwelt among and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth praise the Lord so the seed which is the Life coming from the farmer [Music] from the farmer which is God in this respect enters into our lives by faith the Lord Jesus Christ it goes through the three phases the three courts praise the Lord our body the spirit and into the soul where the seed of life lives so now this seed has to first of all get into this ground like I said then the process of germination starts and life from the ground that makes it live again has to break the she of the seed praise the Lord I want us to go slowly here now when the seed is planted it can never germinate unless the ground gives it life into the seed the seed requires moisture it requires water it requires oxygen and hydrogen and the rest of the minerals for it to Bear life so first of all it has to be broken it body has be broken praise the Lord the outer protection the outer part of the seed Jam has to be broken such that the ground gives it life praise the Lord so now when the outer part is broken and it Ro and dies then the ground the good ground gives it life into the seat so now the life moves through the outer Court it now gets into the seed into the of that seed and ites it it gives it life praise the Lord and when it gives it life then the seed begins to expand the process of germination begins from inside that se if you know the grain if you look at maze praise the Lord it has the outer layer which is always ating then the coting has that part the white part inside it then inside that part there is that jam which is the life of that grain the Lord so now when that M grain is put the ground the ground gives it water IT Supplies it water then the water breaks the outer sh when the outer shet is broken now the inner part also begins to it gets into subjection to the conditions of the ground if doesn't get into subjection the life will never get to the J of the seed and the seed will die but when it gets to subjection the life passes through that part and it reaches the J when it reaches the J the J begins to receive the strength it receives energy and it receives energy it begins now to Bear the life the life now begins praise the Lord that the same way God does to us the farmer goes out to plant his seed and now this seed that falls on good ground it comes out how does it come out because it has obey the conditions of the ground and the ground is the word of God the ground is God himself the ground is the life of Jesus Christ so when we are planted in his word we have receed the word of God we get into subjection to the word we obey the word so the word breaks us down it breaks our EOS it breaks makes our desires it makes this body come into subjection to the word of God then when the body gets into subjection now that life from the ground which is the Life of Christ gets now to the heart and the heart is that white layer is that white layer the the heart is that white layer praise the Lord of that grain praise the Lord so now when life from the ground ends on that layer and the Soul doesn't receive it the seed will still die praise the Lord it will die why the life has not reached the jam praise the Lord now remember it is a very big c it's a big cting so now the life begins to go in and it goes and goes and as it's going that part must also rot it must also break down and when it breaks down the life now moves onto the and when it gets the SE J catches the life and now it catches the life it must not remain there that life must once again must pass through the same process to leave the innermost Court of the seed and now it begins to come out praise the Lord and the farmer is shaking on his seat by day when he plants it today after a week he comes to check whether the seed has come out so now the seed for to manifest the life praise the Lord that was given to it that jam begins again to grow and it brings out the roots praise the Lord and The Roots now begin coming through from the seed J the she to the spirit and there the roots are growing deeper and now it comes out to that second Co and from the second Co it now breaks again out to the outer coat then the leaves begin to grow then the process of germination begins from there then when the fmer comes out he looks at it and become becomes happy because he has seen life the process has begun praise the Lord that is not the end of it the father praise the Lord is Happy until he has seen the fruits of the seity until he has seen the manifestation of the seed which he put to the ground but the Bible says the seed which falls on good ground is the same that grows up and it Springs up and springs up it brings forth fruits praise the Lord and now during that process it is the process that the Bible has said praise the Lord that the suffer of the present the farm is patient praise the Lord and the life in the seat is also patient because it has lost its shape to the roots to the stem praise the Lord and to the leaves but the life is still patient until it finds its way back to the SE again why because the same seed must come into manifestation we have been planted in the word of God praise the Lord and now God has given us his life which has gotten into our hearts down our souls and that life again comes out remember this time around it does not go through a painful process it is not so hard as before praise the Lord why because the seed has subjected itself the outer coat is rotten the midd ised so when the seed is when the life is coming from theide out it is very easy takes a shorter time why the man has subjected himself to the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord then the farmer comes out see the seed growing out and begins to grow he checks on it day at day he provides it with the good atmosphere when the sun is so hot he does not wait for the rains praise the Lord he brings water and begin watering it and begin it he's taking care of the seed he's taking care of the crop because he wants to see the the manifestation of the fruit in the Harvest Time and the farmer does not rest until he gets the seeds ready God has planted us and God shall provide praise the Lord the seat must go through the drought the drought must come it is a part of the process praise the Lord but when the drought comes there are some seeds the Bible says they withered praise the Lord their hearts became weak when trouble came along the way their hearts become weak and their strength goes down why they have not put their hope and their trust in the words they put they have not put their trust in life in the ground so they are not deeply rooted their roots are just on the surface a tree a CR that has have that has their Roots deeply rooted in the ground praise the Lord the droughts may come and it may SC them and during the day sometimes the leaves May wither but the life in the root never with us praise the Lord by day it gets deeper in the in the ground you get deeper in the word you get deeper in the Life of Christ when the Dr comes you have put your hope in the word you have put your hope in Christ and you have the hope that someday there shall be a manifestation of the sons of God you are the sons that must be manifested in that day praise the Lord so when the drought comes it will scch but because you put your trust in the word of God you still remain standing and then the storms will come and it will come and hit you then you go the other sight you go the other s but at the end of the day you still come out Victorious and you remain standing praise the Lord what is the drought the drought are the hardships in life the drought are the persecutions along the way the drought and the sicknesses and trouble that devil brings along the way the Dr are the desires of the flesh that the enemy brings along the way the flesh the desires the lust of the Flesh and the lusts to have material possession and all those kind of things that take away our attention from the word of God the pain that we go through because of sickness that is all drought and if you have not put your hope if your heart is not established if your soul is not establish in the word you can easily come short of strength we than God that he gives us Grace he says in the moments of drought my grace is sufficient in the moments of drought I am still mindful of my se he gives us the strength overcome when the youthful L come our way when the youthful LS come our way he still gives us the grace to go through it and overcome it prise the Lord he's a good farmer mindful about his SE in the end of the day he knows that Harvest is coming and he must Harvest us back praise the Lord seeing us going through the drought and by day we are still remaining standing ad the wild praise the Lord when he sees us you're still standing amidst the wind of doctr that are coming and hitting the church is confident that you are bearing SE that you are bearing his life he's confident then he begins to supply he begins to bring the rign to give you the strength praise the Lord he brings the word the preaching of the word that gives you strength that gives you hope that the life that you're going through is not the end of it he gives you the hope that he is your hope and salvation praise the Lord when the Dr of sickness hits he brings his words that he died praise the Lord that it was all F at calary by his stri you are healed then you get the strength you get the faith you get the Hope believe in your healing and day by day you get the transformation day by day you see healing theing of his words praise the Lord he's the farmer that is concerned by the seat he is the good ground he the life in the seat that is waiting to see at Harvest Time praise the lord we can be good Christians but what proves us good is the life that we manifest praise the Lord our bodies a carrier of the seity and the farmer God the Lord Jesus Christ wants to have these seeds in abundance that's why he sld the seeds that's why he sold his word that's why he gave up his life in the season of manifestation that we must be able to not only bear the fruits but also bring of harvest praise the lord it's not a one day job a process of time and we must be obedient and yeld for the Holy Spirit yeld to the word of God OB the word of God and then you rest from all the TR from all the droughts all the persecution all the pain get that hope the Blessed hope the Blessed assurance that it is well as long as the farmer is in control you don't have control over yourself the seed has no itself is the F to provide good atmosphere so you don't have control over yourself you can't heal yourself you can have the resources you can have the money go to the hospital to buy whatever you want but you can't buy that life it takes God himself to give you that life so if you yeld yourself if we can yeld ourselves and do his word and we rest in the midst of the droughts he will take care of us we have so many people so many of ouren that have withered and their leaves have died and come short of Fellowship praise the Lord some persist but the life isn't Pleasant they persist B towards the pressure of the heat sometimes but they keep their way through why because they have rooted they put their Hope on that blessed hope of assurance during the day the sun's cing us all day long sometimes our leaves lose life and you feel weak fellow praise the Lord sometimes lives with and we become weak but we have that blessed hope that in the evening in the cool of the day in the night we shall regain our strength to push back once again we know that we have a farmer who is very concerned by our Affairs we very concerned by the leaves who wants us be of Fellowship so when you're weak and your leaves have withered and so you have little strength Fellowship he comes with the watering and begins to irrigate you begins to water you can be by the way of the word it can be by way of the word it can be by a worship somehow you start feeling the more still small voice speaking words of encouragement speaking words of hope that is the farmer trying to water the crop why he does not want you to die he wants you to come to manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God praise the Lord as long as the ground is prepared as long as the ground has good [Music] minerals and has the necessary content regardless of how hard the drought hit we know that the lifegiver the life the ground will feed us it will feed our roots and the crop will grow regardless spring to Mur we shall come to maturity we
