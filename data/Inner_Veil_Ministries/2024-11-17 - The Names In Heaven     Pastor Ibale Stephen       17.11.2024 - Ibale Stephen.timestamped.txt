[32:34] amen so we stand
[32:38] up and go to our scripture
[32:47] reading before we do let's bow heads in
[32:50] order of
[32:53] prayer father we give thanks and honor
[32:58] for the grace that you preferred to us
[33:03] Lord that while we were yet
[33:06] sinners Christ died for
[33:09] us we come before your
[33:12] presence trusting in that
[33:15] grace that brought you all the way from
[33:18] Heaven down to earth to pick us clean us
[33:25] and have fellowship with us
[33:28] father in that
[33:29] Grace we pray that you may be
[33:32] present as we read the word and teach it
[33:37] encourage us heavenly
[33:39] father and whatsoever needs we have we
[33:43] trust that in your presence Heavenly
[33:46] Father you are going to meet every
[33:48] need bless your children in a special
[33:52] way in the teaching of the word in Jesus
[33:56] name amen amen so I want once again to
[34:01] greet you in the precious name of our
[34:05] Lord amen and to have the
[34:09] confidence that is going to speak to
[34:12] us we turn to the book of uh St
[34:19] Luke amen chapter
[34:22] 10 and verse
[34:25] 17 it's going to be word of
[34:28] encouragement this
[34:31] morning because the
[34:33] journey has been a very long
[34:36] one and we are still
[34:39] going it's just like when you are
[34:41] running a
[34:44] race some of you who have done
[34:48] Sports you come to a
[34:50] point where you feel like you can't take
[34:55] it but the people who cheer you
[34:59] on they keep saying you can overtake
[35:03] that you can overtake
[35:05] that and you keep
[35:08] overtaking and at the end of the day you
[35:12] celebrate winning the
[35:14] race for us to win the
[35:17] race is just to make the mark of the
[35:20] high calling in
[35:24] Christ amen so St Luke chapter
[35:29] 10 verse
[35:33] 17 and the 17 returned again with Joy
[35:37] saying Lord even the devils are subject
[35:41] unto us through
[35:52] thy and he said unto them I beheld Satan
[35:56] as a light and for from
[36:06] Heaven behold I give unto you power to
[36:11] tread on serpents and
[36:13] scorpions and over all power of the
[36:16] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[36:19] hurt you
[36:31] they came back
[36:33] rejoicing that when we stand no demon
[36:38] stands you see all the diseases and
[36:42] everything so Jesus confirms to
[36:45] them that I've given you all the power
[36:49] you
[36:50] need for the service of the
[36:54] ministry but then he pointed to the
[36:58] them the greater
[37:02] part that they should keep their eyes
[37:05] on and he says in verse
[37:09] 20 not withstanding in this Rejoice not
[37:13] that the spirits are subject unto you
[37:16] but rather Rejoice because your names
[37:19] are written in heaven
[37:32] may the Lord had blessing the reading of
[37:34] his
[37:35] word amen you may be
[37:38] seated now Jesus
[37:42] said that our names are written in
[37:45] [Music]
[37:48] heaven isn't that
[37:50] wonderful you know when you have
[37:52] something that's
[37:55] precious you don't keep it anywhere
[37:58] where anybody can access
[38:03] it you keep it far
[38:06] away where the most cannot
[38:09] reach amen so that you know all the
[38:15] time you are sure that it is totally
[38:21] secure amen so God
[38:24] chose to keep your names in heaven
[38:29] if they were here on
[38:30] Earth maybe some bad man would access
[38:35] them and choose to hurt
[38:38] you but he has hidden these
[38:41] names so seual in
[38:44] heaven where the devil cannot
[38:47] get amen and so I have for a title this
[38:54] morning the
[38:56] names in
[38:58] heaven amen the
[39:00] names in heaven of
[39:04] recent we have so much search for
[39:09] Power and manifestations of the gifts in
[39:12] the
[39:14] church that's very common in
[39:19] Chom but today we shall put our emphasis
[39:23] on the better option
[39:28] the joy of our names being written in
[39:33] heaven so I have referred to it as the
[39:38] better
[39:42] option I did not mean the other part is
[39:45] not
[39:48] important because Jesus even
[39:52] confirm and says that no I've given you
[39:56] power To Tread on serpents and
[40:01] scorpions and over all the power of the
[40:04] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[40:08] hurt
[40:10] you so but the better
[40:15] option is that your
[40:17] name is written in
[40:20] heaven are you happy that your name is
[40:23] written in
[40:25] heaven so we shall look at what the
[40:28] names
[40:30] are and when they were
[40:34] written how the names have over time
[40:37] been
[40:40] secured and also how today those names
[40:45] are being
[40:49] revealed praise the Lord I'll take you
[40:53] into court of the
[40:55] Prophet as we build the foundation
[40:59] here Amen in the message hidden life
[41:03] with
[41:05] Christ he says we were in God's for
[41:11] knowledge you see this is how you should
[41:13] look at
[41:15] yourself don't you think that all of a
[41:19] sudden God just saw you somehow
[41:23] somewhere and then he says okay you also
[41:26] come
[41:28] the scripture says you were in the full
[41:31] knowledge of
[41:33] God and this is so
[41:36] special and I want you to look at
[41:39] it from us you know with spiritual
[41:45] Revelation he says we when God's for
[41:50] knowledge we were
[41:52] saved before the foundation of the
[41:55] world isn't that a powerful
[41:58] statement you were saved before the
[42:02] foundation of the
[42:04] world
[42:06] theologically somebody would say that
[42:09] very
[42:11] wrong but with the eye of
[42:14] Revelation it makes it a very powerful
[42:18] thing to see that you were able to
[42:21] receive Christ as your personal
[42:25] savior amen
[42:27] because you know maybe we shall take
[42:30] this scripture to back that
[42:34] up in John
[42:37] 5 and verse
[42:40] 24
[42:42] amen you love him this
[42:44] morning amen so John
[42:48] 5
[42:53] verse4 very ver I say unto you
[42:58] he that Hearth my
[43:00] word and believeth on him that sent
[43:05] me everlasting
[43:07] life you
[43:10] believe because you
[43:12] have everlasting life you don't believe
[43:17] to receive everlasting life you
[43:22] believe because you've always had
[43:25] eternal life
[43:28] you were secured before the foundation
[43:30] of the
[43:31] world this is what actually brother Bram
[43:34] is trying to
[43:36] say he's looking
[43:38] [Music]
[43:39] behind where before you make your
[43:42] confession for
[43:44] Christ your confession for
[43:47] Christ only confirms that you've always
[43:50] been in him before the foundation of the
[43:55] world Amen
[43:57] so he says we were saved before the
[44:00] foundation of the
[44:04] world Jesus came to die for
[44:09] those who God by for knowledge had
[44:16] elected Amen in for knowledge he elected
[44:20] them and when that last
[44:23] one that's the reason we are having Rev
[44:29] amen pulling with the
[44:32] Nets
[44:34] everywhere and trying to S out and S
[44:38] out that's
[44:41] ministers but when the last one is took
[44:45] out that's all of
[44:47] them amen there will be a last elected
[44:53] one amen so I want you to understand
[44:58] that you are
[44:59] here because God for
[45:02] you amen you must come to the bottom of
[45:08] that you shouldn't say I'm
[45:11] here because maybe my
[45:14] father gave birth to me when I was you
[45:19] know they were in
[45:20] church you see that's not what you
[45:23] should take as a son or daughter of God
[45:28] you should come to the
[45:30] Revelation that God knew you before the
[45:34] foundation of the
[45:35] world so I'll be working around
[45:40] this profound statement of our
[45:44] Prophet amen when it says we were saved
[45:48] even before the foundation of the
[45:52] world so the names of the
[45:55] El were of the lamp's book of
[46:00] life before the foundation of the
[46:03] world and brother Bram is calling it The
[46:07] lamp's Book of
[46:10] Life not on the lamp's
[46:14] book but the L's book of
[46:18] life there are some people who appear in
[46:22] a
[46:22] book and those people they've got the
[46:26] same
[46:27] nature and the same
[46:30] character and the same manner of
[46:33] life with the
[46:37] lamb that's why they are kept in the
[46:39] Lamb's Book of
[46:43] Life not their
[46:46] lives but the Lamb's Book of
[46:50] Life until happen this
[46:52] morning that you exist on the Lamb's
[46:55] Book of Life
[46:58] The Book of Life where the character and
[47:03] the life of the lamp is prescribed or is
[47:09] defined amen and you happen to be part
[47:13] of
[47:15] that so these have surrendered their
[47:19] lives as a
[47:21] sacrifice there are so many things
[47:23] they've given
[47:24] up they could have gone into there but
[47:28] there is
[47:29] something that keeps beckoning them come
[47:33] unto
[47:35] me heav
[47:38] give praise the Lord so you surrender
[47:42] those
[47:43] things and your name simply because your
[47:47] name was put on the last book of life in
[47:52] heaven the foundation of the world
[47:57] praise the Lord if you catch this it's
[48:01] going to be your
[48:04] encouragement and I want to say that the
[48:08] world Listen Now the world where we live
[48:13] was made
[48:15] specifically amen for those who are on
[48:18] the Lamb's Book of
[48:22] Life together with me the devil here on
[48:25] Earth and all his
[48:28] disciples they are
[48:32] squs
[48:35] amen but this Earth belongs to you it
[48:40] was created for the sons of
[48:43] God and that's why God will have to
[48:47] secure it by the
[48:50] purification amen and he's going to
[48:53] purify it by
[48:55] fire and then we shall finally possess
[48:59] it he take away all
[49:03] those that were not in the Lamb's Book
[49:05] of
[49:07] Life so that you can come
[49:11] and come back to the purpose of the
[49:15] creation and this book you the only way
[49:19] can write a
[49:21] book is because it's in my
[49:24] mind are you together with me
[49:27] that's the only way I can write a
[49:29] book because that book is in my mind it
[49:34] has to exist in my
[49:37] mind before it comes in the
[49:40] book before it comes on the
[49:43] pages I don't want to teach the teachers
[49:45] who are
[49:47] here I don't know whether Rogers has
[49:49] written books
[49:52] yet amen but there is no way you can
[49:55] write a book
[49:57] when what you want to write is not in
[49:59] your
[50:01] mind it has to be in your
[50:04] mind before it can get to the pages of
[50:06] the
[50:08] book oh praise the Lord so this
[50:12] book is the mind of the
[50:16] writer amen that
[50:19] means we existed in the mind of
[50:24] God for us to be part of that
[50:28] we existed in the mind of
[50:31] God the mind of
[50:33] God I want you to understand it from the
[50:37] angle of God
[50:40] himself not to understand it on your
[50:45] angle understand it in the angle of
[50:49] God the mind of God is existence
[50:58] amen when God is
[51:01] thinking it is
[51:04] there that's the way the mind of God
[51:10] is that's why in Isaiah
[51:14] 9
[51:16] ver he could say unto
[51:19] us a son is
[51:23] Born the rest of the people could look
[51:25] around
[51:28] but in the mind of
[51:30] God when God
[51:33] thinks it is UN
[51:36] existence so the mind of God is UN
[51:41] existence that's why
[51:43] John the Revelator could
[51:47] say and I saw the holy
[51:51] city New
[51:53] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[51:58] preped as a bride aded for her
[52:02] husband it was a
[52:05] real and yet it is a future
[52:08] thing but John says I saw
[52:11] it before God it was
[52:16] real amen that's the mind of
[52:20] God praise the Lord Brother Bram says in
[52:25] thean chap
[52:27] Church watch
[52:30] carefully and see this before there was
[52:33] ever a SP of
[52:38] Stardust before God was
[52:42] God God is an object of
[52:47] worship an object of
[52:50] adoration and there was no one to
[52:53] worship
[52:55] him so he was at that time only
[53:00] potentially
[53:04] God Amen and he was known only as
[53:09] eternal
[53:13] spirit the
[53:15] bride the bride was already in his
[53:21] mind praise the Lord when there was no
[53:25] creation
[53:27] when there was no
[53:34] stust before there was
[53:36] anything The Pride was on the mind of
[53:41] God yes she was she was existing in his
[53:48] thoughts and what about these thoughts
[53:51] of
[53:53] God they are eternal
[53:56] are they
[53:58] not hallelujah
[54:01] hallelujah he says what about the
[54:04] thoughts of
[54:06] God Amen he pointing at
[54:11] sistera pointing at brother Ronald here
[54:16] he says what about these thoughts of
[54:20] God put yourself in there and then he
[54:24] says are they
[54:27] Eternal they are
[54:29] Eternal praise the Lord so I am not a
[54:33] product of
[54:36] time this body could be a product of
[54:41] time but the real me here is eternal in
[54:45] the
[54:47] heavens amen that's why he sees
[54:51] me seated in Heavenly places
[54:56] Christ
[54:57] Jesus praise the Lord amen so uh he
[55:03] continues to
[55:05] say the Eternal thoughts of
[55:08] God now when he's talking about this
[55:11] eternal
[55:13] thought is not talking about
[55:18] ideas which God has is talking about
[55:24] people who in the mind of
[55:27] God the of the Lord Jesus Christ they
[55:31] originate from
[55:33] thought let me tell you friends there is
[55:36] no man who will say
[55:40] anything without it proceeding from the
[55:44] mind it has to come from the
[55:47] Mind before it can become a
[55:50] word oh hallelujah
[55:53] hallelujah so when God f of
[55:57] us God would come now and put the
[56:02] thought into
[56:04] us and he says Let There
[56:07] Be oh Hallelujah let us make
[56:12] man in our own
[56:14] image praise God yes sir I was there
[56:20] before the foundation of the
[56:23] world don't look at this
[56:27] this is a product of
[56:29] time amen and it dies
[56:33] away until God will raise it
[56:37] again for now it dies away but there is
[56:41] something in there which does not
[56:47] die that's the one I'm talking
[56:51] about which was in the thoughts of God
[56:56] which is referring to the Eternal
[56:58] thoughts of
[57:01] God let ask
[57:03] you the thoughts of God
[57:07] Eternal he has never had a new
[57:10] thought about anything because all his
[57:14] thoughts he has always had and always
[57:18] will
[57:19] have and he knows the end from the
[57:22] beginning because he God that's the
[57:26] thoughts of
[57:27] God are
[57:29] Eternal they are real they are not
[57:32] simply like a
[57:34] man with a
[57:36] blueprint he has grown up which one day
[57:40] will be translated into substance and
[57:45] form but they are already
[57:48] real and
[57:50] eternal part of
[57:54] God that's God
[57:57] praise God and brother Bram preached a
[58:01] message does God change his mind about
[58:04] his
[58:06] word he doesn't change
[58:09] his amen you are written
[58:12] Epistles word of all men you are God's
[58:16] word made
[58:18] manifest are you together with me praise
[58:22] the Lord that's how special you are
[58:26] you come from
[58:27] God I thought that's
[58:31] Eternal and I want to say
[58:34] friend God canot change his mind about
[58:41] you hallelujah hallelujah you will say
[58:44] committed a mistake the other
[58:47] day yes that's why he allowed the
[58:52] blood because you were eternal
[58:56] you only mess up because of
[58:59] this but deep down on the side there
[59:02] there is an eternal
[59:05] SE that already has eternal
[59:09] life praise God David said my
[59:17] substance was not hidden from
[59:21] the When I Was Made In Secret
[59:26] and curiously wrote in the lowest parts
[59:28] of the
[59:31] earth Thine Eyes did see
[59:35] my yet being
[59:40] UNF book where all my members
[59:46] written which in were
[59:50] fashion when as yet there was none of
[59:54] them Hallelujah Hallelujah that is David
[59:58] he says God show my
[1:00:04] existence and the prophet
[1:00:07] says these who are the Royal
[1:00:12] seed and the elect of
[1:00:15] God and the
[1:00:18] predestinated for of God and in the mind
[1:00:22] of
[1:00:23] God and his thought
[1:00:28] where did you come
[1:00:30] from you come from
[1:00:33] God let me tell you the trials you go
[1:00:37] through cannot rob you from the mind of
[1:00:43] God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:47] was
[1:00:49] so that at one
[1:00:52] time he was sinking l
[1:00:56] but God come now and says got yourself
[1:01:00] like a
[1:01:02] man I want talk to
[1:01:04] you where were you when I created the
[1:01:08] heavens he wants to bring most I mean
[1:01:12] Joy to the
[1:01:14] realization that this which is going
[1:01:17] through the
[1:01:19] trials this which is
[1:01:22] jobless this one here which doesn't have
[1:01:24] a child that you cry for
[1:01:28] daily it's just a passing kind of
[1:01:33] dust but the inside of
[1:01:36] you you come from
[1:01:39] God you just forgot who you
[1:01:42] are because you byass
[1:01:46] your are you together with me but God is
[1:01:50] telling Jo you were there when the sons
[1:01:54] of God shouted for
[1:01:56] I was there and I believe that all of
[1:02:00] you were there when the sons of God
[1:02:03] shouted
[1:02:04] for there was a worshiping moment up
[1:02:07] there
[1:02:08] brother amen and brother Bram says in
[1:02:13] very plain
[1:02:15] language the true bride of
[1:02:18] Christ was in the mind of God
[1:02:22] eternally though not expressed
[1:02:26] until each came
[1:02:29] forth in the designated decreed
[1:02:34] season hallelujah hallelujah that's how
[1:02:37] God allows them to come
[1:02:40] for there are those who come in the days
[1:02:42] of
[1:02:43] Noah there are those who come in the
[1:02:45] days of
[1:02:47] Moses there are those who come in the
[1:02:49] days of the
[1:02:50] Prophet there are those who come in the
[1:02:53] days of lther
[1:02:56] designated
[1:02:59] season now every
[1:03:01] SE came forth the right
[1:03:05] season are you together with me every
[1:03:09] seed came at the right
[1:03:11] season to meet your
[1:03:15] temptation to meet your
[1:03:17] trial this is the worst
[1:03:20] age but this is where God wanted you to
[1:03:24] go this is The Edge where you can be
[1:03:28] able to
[1:03:29] overcome brother Bram says in those
[1:03:33] previous
[1:03:35] ages you know it was
[1:03:40] Inquisition amen and he says that was
[1:03:44] easy but in this time the trials of the
[1:03:50] BR is more
[1:03:52] [Music]
[1:03:53] sophisticated amen we are being
[1:03:57] tried by the things that we think are
[1:04:00] necessary for
[1:04:03] life are you together with me so brother
[1:04:07] Bram looking at the trials of this
[1:04:12] hour amen where we are under
[1:04:17] pressure Amen in where we are not fitted
[1:04:21] to
[1:04:22] leave he preached a message how can I
[1:04:29] overcome but yet is the
[1:04:32] age of the
[1:04:34] Overcomer that will bring down the
[1:04:38] throne amen so your name was
[1:04:42] placed in the Lamb's Book of
[1:04:46] Life hallelujah hallelujah when we talk
[1:04:49] about the name we are talking about your
[1:04:54] character that your
[1:04:56] character was
[1:04:59] registered together with the character
[1:05:01] of the
[1:05:04] lamb and was placed in the same
[1:05:07] book Hallelujah hallu you are there in a
[1:05:12] family
[1:05:14] tree amen you are a son of
[1:05:19] God so you have the character of
[1:05:22] God you got the traits of God
[1:05:26] but the problem is that you are behind
[1:05:29] this curtain of
[1:05:32] time this curtain of
[1:05:34] time sometimes makes it difficult for
[1:05:39] you to understand who you
[1:05:42] are you are
[1:05:44] limited because you are covered by this
[1:05:49] flesh
[1:05:51] amen but then your name up there rather
[1:05:58] is in
[1:06:00] heaven your character is a Heavenly
[1:06:05] character what we call to
[1:06:08] overcome is look
[1:06:11] away from what the world offers
[1:06:14] us so that we can look to
[1:06:17] Jesus the and finish of our
[1:06:22] Salvation hallelujah hallelujah you are
[1:06:24] here because the author started the
[1:06:29] work amen the trials are there but the
[1:06:35] author began a
[1:06:37] work a work which he can never
[1:06:41] fail to
[1:06:43] finish praise the Lord so you are going
[1:06:46] to show how you are going to
[1:06:50] manifest the life of the
[1:06:53] Lamb here on Earth that's what you are
[1:06:56] called for to live like the
[1:07:00] love to love like the
[1:07:03] love to forgive like
[1:07:06] the that's the life of
[1:07:11] the are you together with me that's what
[1:07:14] we're called for
[1:07:16] brother you cannot fail if you come from
[1:07:20] God it's not you it's the life of the
[1:07:24] Lamb
[1:07:26] which was given to you you were given
[1:07:29] that life to love your wife to love your
[1:07:34] husband you cannot fail that's the life
[1:07:38] of the Lamb which God has given to
[1:07:43] you you can't fail to
[1:07:46] forgive that's the life of the
[1:07:51] L praise
[1:07:53] God so look at what a name
[1:07:58] is a
[1:08:00] name is anonymous with
[1:08:05] character a name speaks of a Divine
[1:08:12] reputation the of God upon a man's
[1:08:18] life that's a name and Adam called his
[1:08:22] wife's name Eve
[1:08:26] because she was Mother of all
[1:08:30] living that was her
[1:08:33] reputation she was Mother of good and
[1:08:37] bad
[1:08:39] and and so she got a name from that
[1:08:45] nature are you together with me so the
[1:08:49] name speaks of
[1:08:52] character and that's why when the
[1:08:55] character of Jacob
[1:08:58] change even the name
[1:09:00] change from
[1:09:02] Jacob to
[1:09:05] Israel from
[1:09:07] a to with
[1:09:10] God when the character of Abraham
[1:09:14] CH even the name change from
[1:09:18] abrah to
[1:09:20] Abraham father of
[1:09:22] Nations from Sarah to Sarah
[1:09:26] from sa to
[1:09:28] Paul Hallelujah hallu and when you were
[1:09:32] born
[1:09:33] again your name or call it your
[1:09:37] character is also changed
[1:09:42] from son
[1:09:47] God Amen I'm not identified by
[1:09:51] this I'm identified by the SE gen on
[1:09:58] amen amen the character
[1:10:01] changed when you were born
[1:10:03] again from a
[1:10:06] smoker to
[1:10:08] Christian from
[1:10:12] a you had a change of
[1:10:18] character and they were called
[1:10:20] Christians in
[1:10:22] Antioch because they lived like a Christ
[1:10:27] amen so
[1:10:29] Redemption is looking for
[1:10:33] those whose
[1:10:35] lives were synonymous with that of the
[1:10:40] lamb and we
[1:10:44] already put in the Lamb's Book
[1:10:50] of so you not lose any of them
[1:10:55] he just goes
[1:10:57] around and he says
[1:11:02] yeah where are
[1:11:05] you then he
[1:11:07] allows situations to
[1:11:10] come in your life so that you may hate
[1:11:16] this and then you start
[1:11:18] thinking I looked for God no he's
[1:11:23] looking for you
[1:11:26] he allows you to be in the cent of the
[1:11:30] storm and then you start
[1:11:33] crying like a Jonah in the belly of the
[1:11:37] well you don't even start saying
[1:11:40] oh Father I prayed I no God is calling
[1:11:46] you he has read your name here and he

[1:27:19] wor to release the identity of these
[1:27:22] names
[1:27:24] through the
[1:27:26] edges who is worthy to open the
[1:27:29] book and lose the
[1:27:33] seals the Bible says and no man in
[1:27:37] heaven not in Earth NE Earth was able to
[1:27:43] open the
[1:27:44] book look there the names over the
[1:27:50] ages
[1:27:51] sealed and
[1:27:57] that's
[1:27:58] why you could never
[1:28:01] die until you came to the
[1:28:04] Altar and said Lord forgive
[1:28:08] my you were
[1:28:10] secure from all forms of
[1:28:13] accidents from all kinds of
[1:28:16] diseases amen I don't know what happened

[1:28:22] life but the SE of
[1:28:25] God upon your
[1:28:27] life could not be
[1:28:32] broken
[1:28:33] Rejoice because your names are written
[1:28:37] in
[1:28:39] heaven praise the Lord these names were
[1:28:42] on the mind of
[1:28:44] God and Christ already died for the
[1:28:49] name in the mind of God before the
[1:28:53] foundation of the world
[1:28:57] can you imagine because in the mind of
[1:29:01] God God
[1:29:03] thinks it's a
[1:29:11] reality can you see that this
[1:29:14] morning when God
[1:29:17] thinks it's a
[1:29:20] reality look at Revelation 13
[1:29:24] and verse
[1:29:28] eight and all that dwell upon the
[1:29:33] Earth shall worship the
[1:29:38] Antichrist whose names are not written
[1:29:42] in the Book of Life of the
[1:29:49] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[1:29:52] world
[1:29:56] the
[1:29:57] lamp in the mind of
[1:30:01] God was already
[1:30:04] slain before you committed the
[1:30:10] first that's why you are a Christian
[1:30:14] today because God was training
[1:30:18] you to catch you at the right time
[1:30:24] amen and when he called you at the right
[1:30:27] time talk about the
[1:30:31] conviction talk about the
[1:30:33] pain of the life that you had
[1:30:36] lived that God may have mer upon
[1:30:40] you hallelujah hallelujah the lamb was
[1:30:43] found
[1:30:45] worthy and it died on
[1:30:48] Calvary Amen to
[1:30:51] open the book that holds the
[1:30:57] name so in the
[1:31:00] process he had to be born in our
[1:31:06] domain in order to become a
[1:31:11] Kinsman amen so he had to be
[1:31:16] tested by the same elements that caused
[1:31:19] man
[1:31:21] sin in the Garden of Eden
[1:31:25] John says the last of the
[1:31:29] eyes the last of the Flesh and the pride
[1:31:33] of
[1:31:34] life amen but he went through all
[1:31:38] those but he Sanctified
[1:31:41] himself to meet the
[1:31:44] standard of the
[1:31:48] Redeemer amen John 179
[1:31:54] for their
[1:31:56] sakes I sanctify
[1:31:59] myself I offer
[1:32:01] myself I go through the
[1:32:04] requirement amen that I may be
[1:32:09] found the
[1:32:11] Redeemer to redeem this
[1:32:13] name hallelujah hallelujah they were on
[1:32:17] my
[1:32:18] mind and now when they came into the
[1:32:21] flesh they fell
[1:32:24] I have to go in the same
[1:32:26] domain the domain of the
[1:32:28] Flesh and
[1:32:30] overcome so that I may die for them and
[1:32:34] redeem them back
[1:32:37] to
[1:32:39] amen for we have a high
[1:32:43] priest which was
[1:32:46] touched with the feelings of our
[1:32:49] infirmities but in all points
[1:32:54] like we
[1:32:56] are yet
[1:32:59] without amen that way
[1:33:04] he to take
[1:33:09] our because he finally was
[1:33:14] found without
[1:33:16] sin and
[1:33:18] because he had not
[1:33:21] seen even if he died
[1:33:24] death could not
[1:33:30] hold that's why he was able to pay the
[1:33:35] price the Wes of sin is
[1:33:39] death so he
[1:33:41] went into death but he could come
[1:33:45] back because there was no
[1:33:50] on
[1:33:52] Amen so you know first Peter
[1:33:57] 3:18 for Christ also has once suffered
[1:34:05] for the for the
[1:34:09] UN that he may bring us to
[1:34:12] God so without
[1:34:15] sin he offered himself at the
[1:34:19] cross he had the
[1:34:21] power he had the ability
[1:34:24] to put down his
[1:34:26] life and take it back
[1:34:28] again and he was in this flesh
[1:34:31] here
[1:34:33] this is an attraction for
[1:34:37] sin are you together with me so when he
[1:34:42] said you know the when God
[1:34:50] moved then all the sin of the world
[1:34:55] Came Upon
[1:34:58] him on the cross he was an
[1:35:02] ad he was a he was a murderer he was a
[1:35:07] witch all the
[1:35:10] sin
[1:35:12] from when he fell and all
[1:35:16] the to the last elected
[1:35:20] one attracted to him
[1:35:26] but the difference between Adam and
[1:35:30] him is that
[1:35:32] Adam was made a living
[1:35:37] soul but this
[1:35:39] Christ he was a lifegiving
[1:35:43] spirit hallelujah hallelujah so he
[1:35:46] allowed to
[1:35:48] die and the Holy Spirit went and Rose
[1:35:52] him from the dead
[1:35:58] and by so
[1:36:00] doing he had
[1:36:03] captured every nature of
[1:36:06] sin upon himself every
[1:36:11] ofil
[1:36:15] the are you together with me he took it
[1:36:20] and took it back to the
[1:36:22] devil he went into
[1:36:25] hell and gave him his bagage of
[1:36:28] sin that's why the
[1:36:32] resurrection you will be
[1:36:34] perfect without sin or
[1:36:39] Rec because your sin were thrown back to
[1:36:43] the
[1:36:44] devil and The Temptations of
[1:36:47] time the voice of God is allowing you to
[1:36:52] take it under the BL every given time
[1:36:57] every given time so the devil is
[1:37:00] frustrated today you are
[1:37:07] perfect because you are making use of
[1:37:10] the
[1:37:12] blood so that has nothing to do with
[1:37:17] you I don't know whether you see what
[1:37:19] I'm
[1:37:21] saying amen amen he redeemed us and
[1:37:26] possessed every
[1:37:29] name which was in the
[1:37:33] book and then he started calling all the
[1:37:39] names that had
[1:37:41] died from Adam to the time of
[1:37:47] the they came
[1:37:50] up and the Bible says Jerusalem saw
[1:37:56] them and they were taken
[1:37:58] up if they were taken
[1:38:01] up me also nothing will stop
[1:38:07] me are you together with me yes
[1:38:11] sir I said this morning I wanted to
[1:38:15] encourage you to look at
[1:38:18] yourself and understand
[1:38:21] why the scripture say
[1:38:24] we are
[1:38:26] seated in Heavenly
[1:38:28] places with Christ
[1:38:33] Jesus
[1:38:34] amen so he began to call
[1:38:39] us how does he call
[1:38:44] us God is calling names this
[1:38:49] morning do you know how he calls
[1:38:52] it he shows you the
[1:38:56] word when you
[1:38:58] sayen and you mean it from the
[1:39:02] heart you are answering back to your
[1:39:06] name because what you
[1:39:09] believe gives you the
[1:39:12] character of the
[1:39:15] Lamb so you get
[1:39:19] identify with the nature that you
[1:39:22] we in Al's book of
[1:39:27] life
[1:39:28] amen so our names are written in
[1:39:33] heaven let me say this where there is
[1:39:38] no but
[1:39:42] election and in every
[1:39:45] age these names were kept Above the
[1:39:51] Law even in the time
[1:39:54] when the law of
[1:39:56] Moses was
[1:39:58] active the names in the Lamb's Book of
[1:40:02] Life kep Above the
[1:40:06] Law
[1:40:08] amen let me say this in the Garden of
[1:40:13] Eden they were by the
[1:40:16] blood innocent
[1:40:19] love that was taking them above the
[1:40:22] judgment
[1:40:24] under the law of
[1:40:26] Moses these names
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:29] were on the day of the Feast of
[1:40:33] atonement their sin was atoned
[1:40:36] for and the daily
[1:40:39] sacrifice the Believers were kept Above
[1:40:43] the
[1:40:44] Law that's why there's no
[1:40:47] judgment until that day on
[1:40:50] Calvary when he died
[1:40:58] all the names that were written in
[1:41:02] heaven right
[1:41:04] from to the thief on the
[1:41:08] cross all the
[1:41:10] way to the last
[1:41:16] elected you
[1:41:19] see when the voice said
[1:41:24] the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:41:29] prevailed to take the
[1:41:32] book and lose the Nam
[1:41:35] there John took some
[1:41:39] time and he was not seeing
[1:41:43] it and brother Bram says the reason why
[1:41:48] John took moments to
[1:41:51] see is because when the
[1:41:55] lion became the
[1:41:57] lamb he had to go
[1:42:00] back all the
[1:42:04] way
[1:42:06] from to all the
[1:42:09] names to come to where would
[1:42:14] see and then that
[1:42:18] same it
[1:42:20] flowed and covered
[1:42:23] all the seven
[1:42:24] [Music]
[1:42:27] churches when you get
[1:42:30] saved in
[1:42:32] reality you find the blood on the
[1:42:37] altar you find the blood on the
[1:42:41] altar this may be too much for
[1:42:44] you but that's the
[1:42:46] truth amen so where you would perish
[1:42:53] committed after
[1:42:57] C there is constant
[1:43:01] blood which flows from Emmanuel's
[1:43:06] veins to address your dat
[1:43:10] areas even
[1:43:14] now never come to a
[1:43:17] point where you
[1:43:19] think that you are Beyond repair
[1:43:28] I'll take you to First
[1:43:30] John chapter
[1:43:32] 1 and verse
[1:43:35] 8 can somebody say
[1:43:38] Amen praise the Lord first John
[1:43:43] 18 if we
[1:43:45] say that we have not sin we deceive
[1:43:49] ourselves and the truth is not in US
[1:44:03] Paul specified his letters to the
[1:44:10] Gentiles except for the book of
[1:44:14] Hebrews but
[1:44:16] John
[1:44:18] Peter and
[1:44:20] James always wrote
[1:44:24] to the
[1:44:26] Believers that were
[1:44:29] Jews and were disast among the
[1:44:33] Gentiles among them there were people
[1:44:38] who had jistic
[1:44:42] attitude amen where they think they are
[1:44:45] above sea
[1:44:53] the
[1:44:55] Pharisees that would go into the
[1:44:59] temple to pray and they would punch
[1:45:03] their
[1:45:04] test and say thank you I press such a
[1:45:08] number of times a day I don't do like
[1:45:12] this I don't do like this I am not like
[1:45:16] that
[1:45:17] public the lord gave us that
[1:45:20] example so Paul were WR I mean John
[1:45:25] Peter and James their
[1:45:28] letters address those kind of
[1:45:33] people and that's why he says here we
[1:45:36] say that we have no se we deceive
[1:45:40] ourselves and the truth is
[1:45:45] not this always
[1:45:49] believed they were a sinless bunch
[1:45:54] soled with attitude of the
[1:45:59] Pharisees but I want you to
[1:46:01] know that this one
[1:46:04] here is a hybrid
[1:46:10] body it's a
[1:46:14] CO the seed is on the
[1:46:17] inside so we all make mistakes in
[1:46:21] life and some of them are
[1:46:25] FAL but today we thank God for
[1:46:31] Calvary are you together with me so
[1:46:35] verse
[1:46:36] n if we confess our
[1:46:39] sins is faithful and just to forgive our
[1:46:44] sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:46:51] unrighteousness unrighteousness

[1:47:07] moment and search
[1:47:13] yourself he's
[1:47:16] willing to take away all your
[1:47:19] unrighteousness

[1:47:30] blood your to
[1:47:37] God mention it to
[1:47:40] him don't imagine your
[1:47:45] forgiveness but speak with your
[1:47:47] mouth and said God I want your grace
[1:47:53] God I am a
[1:47:55] drunkard God I am
[1:47:58] a confess because confession is
[1:48:06] power are you together with me in verse
[1:48:10] 10 if we say that we have not

[1:48:29] security did you hear that the blood on
[1:48:33] the
[1:48:34] altar is your eternal
[1:48:37] security and this eternal
[1:48:42] security was played
[1:48:44] out in Revelation

[1:49:16] lamb and took the
[1:49:20] book he was Dripping with
[1:49:24] blood to

[1:49:47] call
[1:49:49] ofation your call

[1:49:55] blood so whenever this leads you into
[1:50:00] error speak about it put it under the
[1:50:05] blood Amen Let us look at
[1:50:10] this amen are you together with me so
[1:50:15] the book in the Tabernacle of
[1:50:18] Moses the book in the Tabernacle of
[1:50:21] Moses
[1:50:23] was
[1:50:25] represented by the two
[1:50:28] tablets that were put in the
[1:50:33] AR
[1:50:36] seal by
[1:50:47] the that's now what represented the book
[1:50:52] where the names
[1:50:56] are it was put in a
[1:50:59] box which is called the
[1:51:03] AR of the
[1:51:05] Covenant and the AR of the
[1:51:08] Covenant was covered by a piece a plate
[1:51:12] of
[1:51:14] wood amen like
[1:51:18] this and now on
[1:51:21] this there were the
[1:51:25] throne the Throne of God

[1:51:30] Throne there were two
[1:51:33] chab that stretched out like

[1:51:55] say are you together with me nobody
[1:51:58] could have the
[1:52:01] ability to PL those
[1:52:04] names because you have to remove God
[1:52:06] from his
[1:52:08] throne before you can read the
[1:52:13] book amen so ex
[1:52:19] 25 verse 22

[1:53:25] book but when the lamb
[1:53:29] came and redeemed the
[1:53:32] book at Calvary he held it in his right
[1:53:38] hand and the right
[1:53:40] hand is you know the father held it in
[1:53:44] his right
[1:53:46] hand and the right hand is symbolic of
[1:53:50] authority
[1:53:54] in the New
[1:53:56] Testament in the Old Testament in the AR
[1:53:59] of the
[1:54:01] coven under the M SE in the New
[1:54:05] Testament Jesus came amen I mean he
[1:54:11] came and uh redeemed the
[1:54:14] book from the hand of he that sat on the
[1:54:18] throne

[1:54:25] here is not taking away the

[2:08:01] today but you gave the
[2:08:04] sacrifice to be here and he
[2:08:09] this
[2:08:12] okay so the prophet

[2:08:23] say
[2:08:28] now is to be saved in the time of this
[2:08:32] church
[2:08:38] age
[2:08:39] [Applause]
[2:08:41] all or
[2:08:43] whoever no it don't say that it just
[2:08:47] shows the
[2:08:49] mystery ourselves by
[2:08:53] Faith ourselves by
[2:08:56] faith we believe
[2:08:58] it that's how the names are
[2:09:02] called it's not
[2:09:10] saying that's not how the names are
[2:09:12] called The Calling of the
[2:09:15] names is the revealing of the
[2:09:19] word and when you the word you are
[2:09:23] answering to your
[2:09:26] name because when you believe the
[2:09:30] word

[2:10:06] joy of listening to those little
[2:10:11] Concepts because it designs
[2:10:15] them into what God wants them to do
[2:10:21] praise the Lord I was thinking and I
[2:10:25] thought that we shall participate
[2:10:27] together
[2:10:32] somehow I'll be calling
[2:10:35] somebody that
[2:10:37] tonight you pray with
[2:10:42] us so when I call
[2:10:46] somebody he'll send it to

[2:11:40] book will be able to answer to their
[2:11:44] names by receiving the
[2:11:47] word by
[2:11:49] Revelation so all
