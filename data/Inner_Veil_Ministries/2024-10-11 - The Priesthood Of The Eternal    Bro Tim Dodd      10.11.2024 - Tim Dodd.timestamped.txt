[53:05] Tabernacle of the tent of the
[53:20] congregation and thou shalt set the
[53:22] labor before the tent of the
[53:24] congregation and the Altar and thou
[53:26] shall put water
[53:37] therein and thou shalt set up the court
[53:40] round about and hang up the hanging at
[53:43] the court
[53:53] gate amen the Lord add his Blessing to
[53:55] the word you may have your
[53:57] [Music]
[54:05] seats now God was doing something that
[54:08] Israel had never
[54:12] seen But Moses saw it
[54:17] before he saw it in
[54:22] heaven amen it was a pattern that was
[54:25] shown him in in
[54:30] heaven and God said you'll set this up
[54:33] in
[54:37] Israel and when Israel had come out of
[54:42] Egypt they were just a mob of
[54:47] people just everybody moving Any Which
[54:53] Way but now when Moses had the pattern
[54:56] in
[54:58] Heaven he began to set up the Tabernacle
[55:02] outside the
[55:06] camp it was a representation of
[55:12] something you see the dwelling place of
[55:14] God was to be outside the
[55:18] [Music]
[55:21] camp Jesus suffered outside the camp
[55:27] Paul says let us go unto him outside the
[55:33] camp but there's another group of
[55:36] people that have come through seven
[55:38] Church
[55:40] ages and they are put in order outside
[55:44] the
[55:48] camp you are that
[55:52] people Moses saw it in heaven
[55:56] Israel saw it set up in the
[55:59] wilderness the Jews saw the dwelling
[56:02] place of God at
[56:07] Calvary not the temple in
[56:12] Jerusalem Jesus said destroy this Temple
[56:15] and in three days I'll raise it
[56:20] up he wasn't speaking of herod's
[56:24] Temple temple herod's
[56:28] Temple but he was speaking of the temple
[56:30] of God that he
[56:35] was but you are the temple of
[56:41] God and I'm looking at what Israel was
[56:44] looking
[56:48] at I'm looking at what uh Moses was
[56:52] looking
[56:54] at I'm looking at the Temple of the Holy
[57:01] Ghost are you the Temple of the Holy
[57:05] Ghost amen do you have those slides
[57:08] who's who's operating the slides over
[57:12] here let me just put it in a picture for
[57:18] you all right now when Moses set up the
[57:22] the Tabernacle
[57:26] the the reason he did it outside the
[57:29] [Music]
[57:31] camp was that he was going to set the
[57:33] tribes in order around the
[57:42] Tabernacle because on each side there
[57:44] would be four
[57:51] symbols one symbol on each side
[57:56] this is what he saw in
[57:59] heaven a lion an ox a man and an
[58:05] [Music]
[58:07] eagle give me the next
[58:12] slide so they had emblems of each
[58:17] [Music]
[58:18] tribe and four of the tribes
[58:21] corresponded with what Moses saw in
[58:23] heaven
[58:30] so he knew exactly where to place
[58:34] them next
[58:38] slide we'll just zoom in a little bit
[58:43] here into this Tabernacle in the center
[58:46] of it all was the
[58:50] tabernacle The Dwelling Place of
[58:54] God and
[58:56] next
[58:57] one and in this Tabernacle was Set uh uh
[59:02] vessels of
[59:09] ministration now over here we have the
[59:11] holy of
[59:13] holies in which was the Ark of the
[59:19] Covenant The Mercy
[59:21] Seat the
[59:24] cherubims between which dwelt the Shina
[59:30] glory and no one was to go in
[59:34] there except the high priest once a
[59:39] year and not without
[59:43] blood and then in the Next
[59:46] Room we have the table of
[59:50] showbread and the
[59:53] Candlestick and the altar of incense
[1:00:00] and I want you to notice something about
[1:00:03] this this was
[1:00:06] gold and this was
[1:00:09] gold
[1:00:12] gold but out here it was it was
[1:00:17] brass what is showing us is this room
[1:00:20] was pointing towards this room
[1:00:26] it was not pointing towards the
[1:00:30] outer it was pointing towards the holy
[1:00:33] of
[1:00:35] holies it was taking its order from the
[1:00:38] holy of
[1:00:44] holies now what was Moses doing
[1:00:47] here why did God have this order for
[1:00:54] Israel because Moses was taking what he
[1:00:57] was shown in heaven and putting it in
[1:00:59] action upon the
[1:01:05] Earth and by doing that he was making
[1:01:10] Israel an invincible
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:19] Army I want you to catch this
[1:01:22] now without this order
[1:01:27] they were just a rabble of
[1:01:32] people that was subject to the elements
[1:01:34] of the
[1:01:36] people subject to the
[1:01:41] enemies but with God dwelling in their
[1:01:45] midst they are an invincible
[1:01:50] Army now brother bam says in the church
[1:01:52] age book
[1:01:56] he says remember Christ in the true
[1:01:58] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:02:04] [Music]
[1:02:06] Acts but the Book of Revelation
[1:02:10] shows how that the Antichrist Spirit
[1:02:13] would
[1:02:16] come into the church and defile
[1:02:21] it making it lukewarm powerless and
[1:02:25] formal
[1:02:29] [Music]
[1:02:32] The Book of Revelation exposes
[1:02:37] Satan revealing his
[1:02:41] works right down to the time he's cast
[1:02:44] into the Lake of
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:47] Fire he fights
[1:02:52] that he cannot stand it
[1:02:57] he
[1:02:57] knows that if the
[1:03:01] people get the true
[1:03:05] revelation of the true
[1:03:08] church what happened to my
[1:03:13] Tabernacle and what she
[1:03:17] is what she stands
[1:03:21] for and that she can do the Greater
[1:03:24] Works
[1:03:28] she will be an invincible
[1:03:33] Army so it's speaking about Revelation
[1:03:36] in the
[1:03:38] church that's what this was to
[1:03:42] Israel it was a
[1:03:45] revelation it was a
[1:03:47] type it was foreshadowing
[1:03:53] you because the three courts
[1:03:58] the holy of
[1:03:59] holies the holy place the outer
[1:04:04] Court represented the
[1:04:08] believer the soul the spirit and the
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:17] body next slide is there our next
[1:04:23] one I think we went back to the
[1:04:25] beginning oh
[1:04:30] somehow there we go all right next
[1:04:35] one that's the soulle realm next
[1:04:40] one now oh where' we
[1:04:44] go we'll get it technology isn't it
[1:04:51] wonderful amen
[1:04:56] now in the soul is where God was meant
[1:04:59] to
[1:05:00] dwell in the soul is where God was meant
[1:05:04] to
[1:05:05] [Music]
[1:05:07] dwell now you would think once God dwell
[1:05:10] in the
[1:05:12] soul that that would be all there was to
[1:05:17] it it's a house for
[1:05:20] God and the cloud overshadowed it
[1:05:25] where the where the Ark of the Covenant
[1:05:30] was in there was the shakina of
[1:05:34] Glory if God is there if God is
[1:05:39] there what else do we need all right let
[1:05:42] me take a step into your
[1:05:45] Tabernacle if you are born
[1:05:48] again what else do you
[1:05:52] need if God dwells in your soul
[1:05:56] that finishes it right we're sealed to
[1:06:00] the day of our
[1:06:01] Redemption there's no more work to
[1:06:05] do but that's not what the Tabernacle
[1:06:07] showed
[1:06:09] us there was a holy
[1:06:13] Place representing your
[1:06:17] spirit and in
[1:06:19] there priests were to go every day
[1:06:25] amen there was a Ministry that was to be
[1:06:28] done before the Lord every
[1:06:31] [Music]
[1:06:35] day if that's so in in the
[1:06:41] Tabernacle that's so in
[1:06:45] you amen so we want to look at that
[1:06:49] today thank
[1:06:51] you back in the Garden of
[1:06:54] Eden something
[1:06:58] thing that man could have an Earthly
[1:07:04] existence but he could not enter into
[1:07:06] the
[1:07:09] Eternal a chair of with a flaming sword
[1:07:12] was put before the way of the Tree of
[1:07:18] Life less man would take of the tree of
[1:07:20] life and live forever
[1:07:26] he was cut off from the
[1:07:31] Eternal but when Jesus died at
[1:07:35] Calvary the veil before the holy of
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:42] holies was rent from the top to the
[1:07:47] bottom showing that man could enter
[1:07:50] again into the holy of holies
[1:07:53] [Music]
[1:07:57] man could enter into the Tree of
[1:08:01] Life man could enter into the
[1:08:07] Eternal but when we look at
[1:08:10] it with those
[1:08:12] words it seems like we're going
[1:08:16] somewhere I'm entering into the
[1:08:20] Eternal but that's not really what's
[1:08:23] happening is that God has a dwelling
[1:08:28] place and his dwelling place is in the
[1:08:31] heart of
[1:08:33] man and the sacrifice at
[1:08:38] Calvary opened up the way for the Holy
[1:08:41] Spirit to take up his Dwelling
[1:08:47] Place God coming to his
[1:08:51] [Music]
[1:08:53] Tabernacle amen first Corinthians
[1:08:56] chapter
[1:08:58] 3 it says it this way in verse
[1:09:02] 16 know ye not that you are the temple
[1:09:05] of
[1:09:08] God and the spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:09:12] you if any man defile the temple of
[1:09:18] God him shall God
[1:09:23] destroy for the temple of God is Holy
[1:09:26] which Temple you
[1:09:32] are amen you are the temple of
[1:09:36] God then over in chapter six he says it
[1:09:40] this
[1:09:42] way
[1:09:44] what know ye not that your body is the
[1:09:47] Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:51] [Music]
[1:09:53] which which you have
[1:09:57] God you are not your
[1:10:02] own amen we're in verse
[1:10:07] 19 thank
[1:10:09] you you are not your own it
[1:10:13] says you are not your
[1:10:17] own amen next
[1:10:19] verse for you are bought with a price
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:26] let me put it this
[1:10:28] way you are the real estate of
[1:10:32] God real estate
[1:10:39] property you go and buy a place in the
[1:10:45] city you build a
[1:10:47] house why you want to dwell
[1:10:51] there you bought
[1:10:53] it it's yours
[1:10:56] you have every right to dwell
[1:10:59] there and God purchased you at
[1:11:05] Calvary Hallelujah he bought you with a
[1:11:09] price you are not your
[1:11:13] own therefore glorify God in your
[1:11:19] body and in your
[1:11:22] spirit which for which are God
[1:11:28] here we go
[1:11:29] now he didn't just say glorify God in
[1:11:32] your
[1:11:34] soul when God takes up residence in your
[1:11:40] soul are you with
[1:11:42] me he owns your
[1:11:46] spirit he owns your
[1:11:50] body wherefore glorify God in your body
[1:11:56] and in your
[1:11:57] spirit if you have received God in your
[1:12:02] soul he owns
[1:12:06] you Soul spirit and
[1:12:12] body
[1:12:14] Hallelujah we were born in
[1:12:18] sin but we were meant to be the dwelling
[1:12:21] place of God
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:27] you might have been the trash heap of
[1:12:29] the
[1:12:32] world but God bought
[1:12:35] you so he could dwell
[1:12:38] there Hallelujah he comes in and cleans
[1:12:41] out the
[1:12:45] trash he doesn't dwell amongst
[1:12:50] trash he dwells in the soul Realm
[1:12:56] and the fire of God comes
[1:12:59] down and burns out every evil
[1:13:03] nature gives you a new
[1:13:05] spirit gives you a new
[1:13:08] heart so that then he can give you his
[1:13:10] Spirit
[1:13:14] your amen God is Not only a real estate
[1:13:22] owner he's a real estate developer
[1:13:32] he's developing in
[1:13:36] us the greatest development the world
[1:13:39] has ever
[1:13:45] seen
[1:13:48] Hallelujah Isaiah
[1:13:51] 66 Isaiah 66 uh isah
[1:13:57] verse one says thus sayith the
[1:14:00] Lord the the heaven is my
[1:14:05] Throne the Earth is my foot
[1:14:09] stol where is the house that you build
[1:14:13] me and where is the place of my
[1:14:18] rest for all those things has my hand
[1:14:22] made
[1:14:27] and all those things have been sayith
[1:14:30] the
[1:14:33] Lord but to this man will I
[1:14:39] look even to him that is of a poor and a
[1:14:43] contrite
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:14:50] spirit and trembleth at my word
[1:14:57] who was that
[1:14:59] man it was Jesus
[1:15:03] Christ the firstborn among many
[1:15:09] Brethren Jesus said in Matthew
[1:15:13] 11 verse 29 says take my yoke upon
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:19] you and learn of
[1:15:22] me for I am meek and L in heart and you
[1:15:26] shall find rest unto your
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:35] soul amen the unbeliever is restless in
[1:15:38] his
[1:15:42] [Music]
[1:15:46] soul if he's a seed of
[1:15:50] God there's something calling out
[1:15:55] there's a deep
[1:15:57] calling because he was made to be a
[1:15:59] Dwelling Place of
[1:16:03] God and Jesus
[1:16:06] came in whom God dwelt in his
[1:16:11] fullness to show the pattern of God's
[1:16:18] Tabernacle that's why he could
[1:16:21] say destroy this
[1:16:23] Temple this
[1:16:26] Temple and in three days I'll raise it
[1:16:32] up he was telling
[1:16:34] them I am the temple of
[1:16:39] God and I'm the firstborn among many
[1:16:44] Brethren and Paul's telling
[1:16:47] you you are the Temple of the Holy
[1:16:51] Spirit you're after the same pattern
[1:16:57] amen amen so so the scripture says let
[1:17:00] this mind that was in Christ be in
[1:17:07] you that's not just some vague
[1:17:12] idea the
[1:17:14] mind the
[1:17:16] spirit the thought
[1:17:20] processes the mind that was in Christ
[1:17:25] he didn't just say the soul that was in
[1:17:28] Christ but he said the mind that was in
[1:17:31] Christ he didn't just say the holy of
[1:17:35] holies but there's another
[1:17:39] room that requires daily
[1:17:47] ministration your spirit
[1:17:51] realm where your mind is
[1:17:55] where is the greatest battle ever
[1:17:59] fought where it's bombarded from the
[1:18:02] outer
[1:18:06] court but it's made to be in the image
[1:18:09] of
[1:18:13] Christ that's why the holy of holies was
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:19] gold and the holy place was gold
[1:18:25] and all the instruments was
[1:18:29] gold the table of showbread was
[1:18:35] gold the altar of incense was
[1:18:40] gold the Candlestick was solid
[1:18:47] gold let everything in that mind realm
[1:18:50] be deity
[1:18:57] Hallelujah let your let your thought
[1:19:00] process be nothing but the thoughts of
[1:19:09] God it was not part
[1:19:11] gold part
[1:19:14] gold and part
[1:19:16] silver and part
[1:19:19] brass and part
[1:19:21] wood and part this and part that
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:26] if you stood in that
[1:19:29] room everywhere you
[1:19:31] turned it was
[1:19:34] gold
[1:19:36] Hallelujah let this mind which was in
[1:19:39] Christ be in
[1:19:42] you who thought it not robbery to be
[1:19:45] equal with
[1:19:49] God but made himself of no reputation
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] and took on him the form of a
[1:20:01] servant and and was made in the likeness
[1:20:04] of
[1:20:08] men now what is Paul describing
[1:20:12] here in his thoughts he was equal with
[1:20:17] God but on the
[1:20:19] outside was Badger
[1:20:22] skins he was made in the likeness of man
[1:20:28] Amen on the outside was an altar of
[1:20:33] sacrifice a
[1:20:35] lab made of
[1:20:38] brass not
[1:20:40] gold
[1:20:42] judgment not
[1:20:45] deity that's what brass represents
[1:20:52] judgment so when people looked at Jesus
[1:20:57] there was no beauty that they should
[1:21:01] desire when people looked at this
[1:21:03] Tabernacle from the
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:08] outside there was no Beauty to
[1:21:13] it when people look at you from the
[1:21:18] outside there's no Beauty to
[1:21:21] it nothing special about you
[1:21:26] but
[1:21:27] inside it's
[1:21:31] de inside it's all
[1:21:36] gold inside it's meant to be just
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:44] God hallelujah
[1:21:55] but you know what there's daily
[1:21:59] [Music]
[1:22:01] ministration there's things that you
[1:22:03] need to do every
[1:22:07] day to keep the spirit in
[1:22:16] order in the soul
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:21] realm in the holy of
[1:22:23] holies where the Shina
[1:22:29] dwells all right in there there's no
[1:22:33] daily
[1:22:35] ministration why because you're sealed
[1:22:38] to the day of your
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:44] redemption in the soul
[1:22:47] realm there's no
[1:22:51] anxiety no worries
[1:22:54] there's no
[1:22:58] complexes there's no
[1:23:06] nervousness there's no
[1:23:12] nervousness there's no
[1:23:15] bitterness I'm glad my interpreter
[1:23:17] doesn't even know these
[1:23:21] words he doesn't struggle against the
[1:23:27] but some people
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:33] do in the soul
[1:23:36] realm there's no
[1:23:42] Strife in the soul
[1:23:44] realm there's no
[1:23:48] envying my he's an amazing man
[1:23:51] [Laughter]
[1:23:55] praise the
[1:23:57] Lord you see the Bible
[1:24:00] says in the word there is none of these
[1:24:06] things but now though we walk in the
[1:24:11] flesh 2 Corinthians 10 and verse
[1:24:16] three we do not war after the
[1:24:20] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:24:24] not
[1:24:27] carnal they're not
[1:24:29] fleshly but Mighty through God to the
[1:24:32] pulling down of
[1:24:35] [Music]
[1:24:38] strongholds what kind of
[1:24:42] strongholds physical
[1:24:47] strongholds no spiritual strongholds
[1:24:56] casting down
[1:25:01] imaginations and every High
[1:25:06] thing that exalts itself against the
[1:25:09] knowledge of
[1:25:13] God and bringing into
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:17] captivity every
[1:25:21] thought every thought
[1:25:24] [Music]
[1:25:25] every
[1:25:28] thought to The Obedience of
[1:25:32] [Music]
[1:25:33] Christ there's a work in your
[1:25:37] life where the holy
[1:25:39] spirit in the soul
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:44] realm must have the preeminence in your
[1:25:47] spirit
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:51] realm that the thoughts of Christ might
[1:25:54] be
[1:25:57] preeminent because the devil also puts
[1:26:00] his thoughts
[1:26:04] there but we are to bring all those into
[1:26:11] captivity to The Obedience of Christ the
[1:26:18] word specifically the anointed word for
[1:26:21] your day
[1:26:26] [Music]
[1:26:30] amen now let's look at the difference
[1:26:33] here are you still with
[1:26:39] me
[1:26:41] okay now in the outer
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:45] realm like the outer Court in the
[1:26:52] Tabernacle Aaron he had a
[1:26:56] rod in that Rod that he used to walk
[1:27:01] with he would walk through the outer
[1:27:05] court maybe he would even come into the
[1:27:08] holy
[1:27:11] place and he had this
[1:27:13] Rod it was a nice
[1:27:17] Rod it was made of an almond tree
[1:27:24] and you know if he would have taken the
[1:27:27] tree of knowledge he did if he would
[1:27:30] have taken the tree of
[1:27:31] [Music]
[1:27:34] knowledge maybe he could have put that
[1:27:36] rod in the
[1:27:40] ground and water
[1:27:43] it and then fertilize
[1:27:48] it and keep it
[1:27:52] wet and maybe over
[1:27:56] time in the right
[1:28:00] circumstances he might see a little bud
[1:28:02] come from that
[1:28:06] rock it might take
[1:28:09] years but if life started to
[1:28:13] come then it would grow into a
[1:28:17] tree and it would eventually
[1:28:20] leaf and then it would bud or it would
[1:28:23] flower
[1:28:26] and then he would get almond
[1:28:29] from but they had a dispute in
[1:28:33] Israel and Moses said let everybody
[1:28:35] bring their rod into the holy of
[1:28:40] holies everybody who thinks they should
[1:28:42] be the high
[1:28:45] priest and he put them in the holy of
[1:28:49] holies and in one
[1:28:51] day Aaron's rod buted
[1:28:55] put forth
[1:28:57] flowers put forth
[1:28:59] fruit all in one
[1:29:02] day why because in that
[1:29:06] place is
[1:29:09] eternity
[1:29:11] and in
[1:29:14] eternity there's no
[1:29:17] yesterday and there's no tomorrow
[1:29:24] there's no next
[1:29:26] month there's no next
[1:29:29] year there's no
[1:29:32] sometime in
[1:29:35] eternity it's always
[1:29:40] today Hallelujah in eternity
[1:29:54] everything in that
[1:29:58] realm was
[1:30:01] life
[1:30:03] Hallelujah when they put the Mana in
[1:30:07] there Mana that God said don't keep it
[1:30:11] more than one
[1:30:14] [Music]
[1:30:16] day and if they
[1:30:19] kept if they kept it
[1:30:22] overnight it would
[1:30:24] rot and it would get
[1:30:27] maggots and it would
[1:30:29] spoil they were taught it only last for
[1:30:32] one
[1:30:34] day but in
[1:30:38] eternity in the
[1:30:40] Eternal there's no
[1:30:43] yesterday and there's no
[1:30:47] tomorrow so the Mana which was for
[1:30:52] today it's all is
[1:30:57] today so the manner could not go
[1:31:01] back in the presence of the
[1:31:06] Eternal
[1:31:08] Hallelujah that's the realm we are
[1:31:10] connected
[1:31:13] to when God births you by the Holy
[1:31:18] Spirit he has connected you to Eternity
[1:31:24] Paul says we are anchored Beyond the
[1:31:30] Veil that's why in your
[1:31:33] soul where the Holy Ghost
[1:31:36] dwells there is unlimited
[1:31:41] power power to speak worlds into
[1:31:46] existence
[1:31:48] amen that's the kind of power that
[1:31:50] dwells in you
[1:31:54] but is subject to a
[1:31:58] law and that law is
[1:32:02] faith in your
[1:32:04] spirit there must be
[1:32:07] Faith because faith is tied to the
[1:32:13] Eternal I'll go into that tonight sorry
[1:32:17] I'll go into that in the
[1:32:19] next but I want us to catch
[1:32:22] here you're not just a Eternal creature
[1:32:25] in
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:31] idea you are an actual possessor of
[1:32:35] Eternity within your
[1:32:43] soul and the Tabernacle
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:56] the Tabernacle was showing
[1:32:59] us our
[1:33:02] Spirits must point to the
[1:33:07] Eternal not to the
[1:33:12] temporal or our
[1:33:15] thoughts must point to the
[1:33:19] Eternal not to the temporal
[1:33:25] what did Jesus say take no thought
[1:33:32] for for what for tomorrow for
[1:33:37] tomorrow for sufficient unto the
[1:33:42] day now if you're not going to think
[1:33:44] about
[1:33:48] tomorrow you're thinking Eternal
[1:33:50] thoughts
[1:33:55] because in eternity There's No
[1:34:01] Tomorrow
[1:34:03] amen amen he says take no thought for
[1:34:06] what you would drink or eat or be
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:12] cloth don't let your thoughts be
[1:34:15] consumed with the
[1:34:18] outward Hallelujah
[1:34:26] give me the next
[1:34:29] scripture behold the fowls of the air
[1:34:32] they sow not neither do they
[1:34:38] reap but your heavenly father feeds
[1:34:43] them and aren't you better than
[1:34:49] they Jesus said consider the lies yes
[1:34:56] they neither toil nor
[1:35:02] spend but Solomon in all of his glory
[1:35:05] was not a r as one of
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:12] these Solomon in all of his
[1:35:17] wisdom in all of his
[1:35:20] wealth could never be as pretty as a
[1:35:22] lily
[1:35:29] think Eternal
[1:35:36] thoughts it's a daily
[1:35:42] battle it's
[1:35:44] a it's a constant
[1:35:48] battle there's no days
[1:35:52] off he can't say Sunday's my day
[1:35:56] off the devil never bothers me on
[1:36:02] Sunday
[1:36:04] amen is that right no no the Devil comes
[1:36:09] after you on
[1:36:11] Sunday matter of fact he came to church
[1:36:14] this
[1:36:15] morning because he wants to distract you
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:20] from cuz he hates revelation
[1:36:27] he doesn't want you to know who you
[1:36:31] are because then you'd be an invincible
[1:36:37] Army so what he does he can't stop you
[1:36:41] from being born
[1:36:43] again once you're born again you're
[1:36:46] sealed to the day of your
[1:36:48] Redemption but where is the attack on
[1:36:51] the believer
[1:36:54] in the mind
[1:36:56] realm in the
[1:37:00] attitude because the right mental
[1:37:05] attitude towards any Divine
[1:37:10] promise will bring it to
[1:37:14] pass it's when you have the new
[1:37:18] birth you have enough power to create
[1:37:24] but it's the mental attitude that makes
[1:37:26] the believer
[1:37:31] powerless but the anointing that God
[1:37:34] sends in each
[1:37:37] age is sent to combat the devil in your
[1:37:42] thoughts do in your thought combat the
[1:37:45] devil in your
[1:37:50] thoughts amen it's a daily battle
[1:37:58] that's why there's a daily
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:04] ministration let
[1:38:06] this let this mind that was in Christ
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:12] Jesus so
[1:38:14] now Ephesians 4 and6 says it this
[1:38:20] way says be careful for nothing
[1:38:26] that is to say be worried about
[1:38:30] nothing Philippians I sorry did I say
[1:38:32] Ephesians Philippians 4 and
[1:38:36] 6 be careful for
[1:38:40] nothing but in everything by
[1:38:45] prayer and
[1:38:48] supplication with
[1:38:50] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[1:38:53] known known unto
[1:38:57] God daily
[1:39:00] prayer and the peace of
[1:39:04] God which passes all
[1:39:08] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:39:12] Minds through Christ
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:18] Jesus not just your
[1:39:21] hearts not just the heart
[1:39:24] but your minds
[1:39:26] also finally
[1:39:29] Brethren whatsoever things are
[1:39:32] true whatsoever things are
[1:39:35] honest whatsoever things are
[1:39:38] just whatsoever things are
[1:39:41] pure whatsoever things are
[1:39:46] lovely with whatsoever things are of a
[1:39:48] good
[1:39:51] report if there be any
[1:39:54] virt if there be any
[1:39:58] praise these things are
[1:40:04] Eternal think on these things
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:23] [Applause]
[1:40:28] all
[1:40:29] right
[1:40:31] now there there's three types of
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:36] ministration first is the table of
[1:40:41] showbread 12 loaves representing the 12
[1:40:44] tribes of
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:48] Israel a type of the Mana
[1:40:53] but this bread only the priests could
[1:41:00] eat this bread wasn't for
[1:41:04] everybody it's represented it's
[1:41:07] representing seven Church
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:12] ages as it is made fresh every seven
[1:41:19] days the showbread represents faith in
[1:41:23] the word for your
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:32] day brother Bram says you're living in
[1:41:34] his
[1:41:37] presence eating the showbread that's
[1:41:39] only provided that day for
[1:41:47] believers priest
[1:41:51] only so then it's only for those that
[1:41:53] are born
[1:41:56] again amen it's only for the born
[1:42:01] again all right so it's not for the
[1:42:05] unbeliever he has made you Kings and
[1:42:11] Priests so there's a daily feeding upon
[1:42:15] the
[1:42:19] word and you have been sent a special
[1:42:22] portion for your
[1:42:30] age Hallelujah let me go a little bit
[1:42:34] further he says the sh of Glory
[1:42:38] manifests
[1:42:41] him it brings forth the Word of Promise
[1:42:44] right out to
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:49] you Jesus this is in the unveiling of
[1:42:52] God
[1:42:55] he says that's the reason he had to Veil
[1:42:57] Moses
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:01] face because in him was the
[1:43:04] word he veiled Jesus as a humble little
[1:43:11] man to keep them from seeing
[1:43:17] Jehovah oh my how we should have SE how
[1:43:20] Israel should have seen it
[1:43:23] they should have recognized why did they
[1:43:25] Veil
[1:43:27] Moses they built he built a
[1:43:31] tabernacle and God dwelt behind the
[1:43:35] veil and then Moses come out from the
[1:43:37] presence of
[1:43:39] God and his face
[1:43:42] sha and they had to Veil
[1:43:45] Moses it was showing that man was meant
[1:43:48] to be the dwelling place of God
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:54] the veil on the Tabernacle was only a
[1:44:00] type the veil on Moses was showing the
[1:44:03] real dwelling place is
[1:44:09] man and Jesus was veiled as a humble
[1:44:12] little
[1:44:16] man and then brother brandham
[1:44:19] says he veils himself today
[1:44:25] in Earth and
[1:44:28] vessels with the
[1:44:31] Shina the shakina is dwelling in
[1:44:36] you but it's veiled to the
[1:44:42] world he says the outside looks like a
[1:44:45] bunch of Holy
[1:44:51] Rollers he says old Badger
[1:44:56] skins but the inside hides the shikina
[1:45:05] glory now listen
[1:45:08] closely and it ripens the showbread that
[1:45:12] we feed on ripens ripens
[1:45:20] [Music]
[1:45:23] what is he
[1:45:24] saying the word comes into your
[1:45:28] mind you feed on
[1:45:31] it because you're a
[1:45:34] priest and the power of God within
[1:45:38] you brings that to
[1:45:43] maturity you might only understand a
[1:45:45] little bit
[1:45:47] today but keep walking with
[1:45:51] God keep thoughts on the
[1:45:55] Eternal until the word that you're
[1:45:57] feeding
[1:46:00] on becomes ripen to you
[1:46:06] personally and you can see yourself in
[1:46:09] the
[1:46:13] world
[1:46:14] [Applause]
[1:46:18] hallelujah mean the bread doesn't make
[1:46:21] you a priest
[1:46:26] you it is for those that are called
[1:46:31] priests the message doesn't make you a
[1:46:40] Believer it is for the
[1:46:44] [Applause]
[1:46:49] predestinated you always were a believer
[1:46:55] and one day the word came by your
[1:47:00] way and it proved you were a
[1:47:06] Believer it proved you're a Son of
[1:47:10] God provve you're a daughter of
[1:47:14] God As I said
[1:47:17] yesterday you didn't gain representation
[1:47:20] by believing
[1:47:28] you believe because you already had
[1:47:30] representation in the mind of
[1:47:44] God hallelujah
[1:47:55] [Music]
[1:48:06] for
[1:48:28] praise the Lord I wish I spoke your
[1:48:34] language sounds better in your language
[1:48:36] than in
[1:48:42] mine see he was The Rock in the
[1:48:47] wilderness he was the Mana that came
[1:48:49] down from heaven
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:54] he was a showbread in the
[1:48:59] temple and the reason brother Brown says
[1:49:02] we can't have
[1:49:05] faith is because we don't know who he
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:09] is he's the showbread on the
[1:49:15] table he's the message to every
[1:49:21] age and he comes to
[1:49:24] you to show you you're a part of
[1:49:29] him and as brother brandham
[1:49:32] says we just need to lay in the presence
[1:49:34] of the
[1:49:37] [Music]
[1:49:38] son and let these things ripen in our
[1:49:45] lives that's the reason the veil was
[1:49:47] rent in the
[1:49:49] [Music]
[1:49:50] temple that kind of Glory could come
[1:49:52] into
[1:49:55] you to ripen the word for your
[1:50:02] age bring you into
[1:50:08] relationship he says brother brandham
[1:50:10] says in the
[1:50:13] Rapture what is the
[1:50:16] shout it's the
[1:50:19] message going forth first
[1:50:24] the living bread of life bringing forth
[1:50:28] the
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:34] bride that's why when the angel said to
[1:50:36] John take the book and eat the
[1:50:42] book it wasn't a leather
[1:50:45] book it was
[1:50:48] Christ The Living bread of life
[1:50:53] and when you eat
[1:50:55] him you become like
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:02] him let's move on to the
[1:51:07] Candlestick remember daily
[1:51:11] Ministry if the priest was in the Holy
[1:51:14] place and got
[1:51:18] hungry he had every right to take a
[1:51:21] piece of the bread from the table
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:25] and eat it it was his
[1:51:30] place brother BR says why do you
[1:51:34] hunger why do you
[1:51:36] thirst it's God trying to get these
[1:51:39] mystery truths to
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:46] you then he says but you let your
[1:51:51] pastor you let your
[1:51:54] Church you let your teaching take it out
[1:51:56] of
[1:52:01] you what's he talking about the Mind
[1:52:04] realm is out of
[1:52:07] order there's too many thoughts that are
[1:52:10] contrary to the
[1:52:15] word you're hungering you're
[1:52:20] thirsting but there's no showbread on
[1:52:22] the the
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:25] table oh we need to put the message on
[1:52:28] our table every
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:34] day feeding on the
[1:52:37] word to satisfy the hunger within
[1:52:41] [Music]
[1:52:43] us amen
[1:52:47] Candlestick now we know that the seven
[1:52:50] golden candlesticks represent the seven
[1:52:52] Church
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:57] ages Revelation chapter 1 tells us
[1:53:03] that and
[1:53:05] so let me just read it the way brother
[1:53:07] brandham said
[1:53:10] it he says what is a
[1:53:14] Candlestick it's a lamp
[1:53:19] stand notice how beautiful here
[1:53:23] he saw this one like the son of man
[1:53:25] standing in the midst of the seven
[1:53:27] golden
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:31] lampstands which means seven Church
[1:53:36] ages each pipe or lamp stem hooked into
[1:53:40] the main big oil
[1:53:44] [Music]
[1:53:48] sensor are
[1:54:02] which
[1:54:09] are and they and the come down into the
[1:54:15] oil they poured oil in the
[1:54:21] top and the lamp with the wick hanging
[1:54:23] down kept burning day and
[1:54:29] night you never had to light
[1:54:32] it you just keep pouring oil into
[1:54:34] [Music]
[1:54:36] it all right am now he
[1:54:43] says well let's just leave that quote
[1:54:46] there now how appropriate it is to see
[1:54:50] the lamp and the wick and the oil
[1:54:52] o how
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:02] appropriate all right now we see more
[1:55:05] than a lamp and a wick and an
[1:55:12] oil there's one more
[1:55:16] thing
[1:55:18] Fire
[1:55:20] Light so there's four things
[1:55:24] all right the oil represents the Holy
[1:55:29] Ghost the lamp represents the
[1:55:35] age the fire represents the
[1:55:39] [Music]
[1:55:42] experience but now the wick is
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:48] you you see you've got to be you've got
[1:55:52] to be living in the
[1:55:58] oil there's one baptisms but there's
[1:56:01] many
[1:56:12] feelings and the experiences of our life
[1:56:15] is represented in the
[1:56:20] fire in the age that living
[1:56:23] in but now I want to talk about the wick
[1:56:26] for a
[1:56:27] minute because the wick was the only
[1:56:30] thing that would cause a
[1:56:34] problem because after it would burn for
[1:56:36] a
[1:56:38] while the wick would get carboned
[1:56:44] up it would get deposits of old burnt up
[1:56:48] Wick
[1:56:51] [Music]
[1:56:54] and that needed to be trimmed
[1:56:59] off because if you didn't trim
[1:57:02] it then it would cause the light to dim
[1:57:08] down and it would call cause the lamp to
[1:57:14] smoke see what are you saying brother
[1:57:17] Tim there's things in your life you need
[1:57:20] to keep trimmed off
[1:57:25] you know in the last days the cry went
[1:57:30] out behold the bridegroom
[1:57:34] comes rise and trim your
[1:57:38] [Music]
[1:57:41] lamps what are you
[1:57:44] trimming oh listen
[1:57:47] Saints what is that carbon
[1:57:55] it is yesterday's
[1:57:58] [Music]
[1:58:01] burning you can't live on yesterday's
[1:58:06] burning you can't live on what God did
[1:58:11] yesterday you can't live on Luther
[1:58:13] Wesley or
[1:58:16] [Music]
[1:58:18] Pentecost you've got to come into the
[1:58:21] experience of this
[1:58:25] [Music]
[1:58:26] day if you
[1:58:29] don't oh it'll still
[1:58:31] burn but it'll be
[1:58:34] Smokey it'll be
[1:58:38] dim it won't be the full brightness of
[1:58:41] the
[1:58:44] word it was a good burning in those
[1:58:50] days it was bright in those
[1:58:55] days but we are called to walk in the
[1:58:58] brightness of this
[1:59:04] hour
[1:59:06] amen and now let me go a little bit
[1:59:08] personal
[1:59:11] here because this is the light that's
[1:59:13] burning in the Holy place or the mind
[1:59:18] [Music]
[1:59:23] have you ever seen someone that's a good
[1:59:25] brother or a good
[1:59:29] sister and they're just
[1:59:39] downcast you know they're born
[1:59:43] again but they just seem don't seem to
[1:59:45] have that spark anymore
[1:59:53] the pressures of Life have got to
[1:59:58] them you see that what has happen is the
[2:00:00] wick has got carboned
[2:00:05] up and the full effect of the oil can't
[2:00:09] have its preeminence in their
[2:00:14] [Music]
[2:00:16] lives you need to trim the
[2:00:20] lamp it it's you you need to trim the
[2:00:26] lamb don't rely on what happened
[2:00:30] yesterday you need a fresh daily
[2:00:33] experience with
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:40] God hallelujah if you're downcast this
[2:00:46] morning you need to say Lord trim my
[2:00:49] lamp
[2:00:53] if you're fearful this
[2:00:56] morning Lord trim my
[2:01:00] L amen if there's something troubling
[2:01:03] you in your mind this
[2:01:06] morning the Bible says an eternal
[2:01:11] thought is not worried about
[2:01:14] anything but if you're worried about
[2:01:16] something this
[2:01:18] morning you need to say Lord trim my
[2:01:20] lamp this morning
[2:01:24] take away every
[2:01:25] doubt take away every
[2:01:28] fear take away every wrong
[2:01:31] thought because when you trim away all
[2:01:34] those
[2:01:36] things now your thoughts are getting
[2:01:38] into the mind of
[2:01:43] Christ now you're getting into
[2:01:45] relationship with God the way he wants
[2:01:48] it
[2:01:52] let this mind that was in Christ
[2:01:56] Jesus
[2:01:59] Hallelujah
[2:02:06] me
[2:02:13] me
[2:02:15] listen I'm going to drop this in now
[2:02:23] when brother brandham had a prayer
[2:02:26] line he'd stand before the
[2:02:30] person he says we we have here like the
[2:02:33] Jesus and the woman at the
[2:02:37] well except in this case it's a
[2:02:43] man and he says now I don't know what
[2:02:47] her problem
[2:02:50] is but what I'm doing is what Jesus did
[2:02:53] to the woman at
[2:02:55] [Music]
[2:02:57] the I'm trying to contact her
[2:03:03] spirit because to find out what's wrong
[2:03:06] with
[2:03:08] her
[2:03:11] listen what's wrong with the person is
[2:03:14] in their
[2:03:16] Spirit many times you say now I see
[2:03:18] you're a Christian
[2:03:22] now if they're a
[2:03:24] Christian the power of Divine Healing is
[2:03:26] already in
[2:03:30] them the power of Deliverance is within
[2:03:34] them but there's something in their
[2:03:37] Spirit that's hindering the power of God
[2:03:39] from moving in their
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:47] lives see that's why we have to bring
[2:03:50] every thought into captivity to the
[2:03:53] [Music]
[2:03:56] word sometimes brother Brandon would say
[2:03:59] oh you you had a lie told about
[2:04:04] you it wounded you in your
[2:04:07] [Music]
[2:04:09] spirit somebody said you had a
[2:04:12] devil but you don't have a devil you're
[2:04:16] a
[2:04:17] Believer now just a minute
[2:04:19] here if there were a believer believer
[2:04:22] why were they
[2:04:25] bothered it was it was something in
[2:04:28] their
[2:04:30] mind because somebody said something to
[2:04:33] them that was
[2:04:37] [Music]
[2:04:38] wrong because and then the devil
[2:04:41] anointed
[2:04:43] that to to get them into the wrong
[2:04:49] attitude to make them powerless
[2:04:53] come on Saints this is spiritual stuff
[2:04:55] this
[2:04:57] morning this is the realities of a
[2:04:59] Christian
[2:05:04] battle the word of
[2:05:06] God the prophet comes to change the
[2:05:10] thoughts in the
[2:05:15] mind because if he can get her to
[2:05:17] believe him
[2:05:21] who is he he's the word of the
[2:05:26] hour if he can get her to believe
[2:05:29] him nothing will stand at his
[2:05:32] [Applause]
[2:05:34] prayer believing is in the
[2:05:38] mind faith faith is in the
[2:05:42] soul but believing is in the
[2:05:45] mind it's what you do with the
[2:05:50] faith you believe with the faith that
[2:05:52] you
[2:05:56] have Jesus came to the man that have an
[2:05:59] eptic
[2:06:01] child and the man said Lord your
[2:06:03] disciples couldn't do anything for
[2:06:06] myself he says please can you do
[2:06:09] something and Jesus says I can if you
[2:06:15] believe and he said then he says in the
[2:06:18] King
[2:06:20] James Lord I
[2:06:22] believe help thou my
[2:06:27] unbelief now what is he
[2:06:29] saying he's saying Lord I
[2:06:32] believe but help my lack of
[2:06:38] faith because faith is a
[2:06:42] substance faith is a
[2:06:45] revelation faith comes by hearing the
[2:06:49] word so the man was looking Ates
[2:06:52] Jesus he was believing with every bit of
[2:06:55] Faith he
[2:06:58] had the problem is he didn't have enough
[2:07:02] faith and that's many people's
[2:07:06] problem it's not that they're not
[2:07:10] believing they're
[2:07:12] believing but they haven't been feeding
[2:07:14] on the
[2:07:17] showbread because faith comes by the
[2:07:19] showbread
[2:07:23] faith comes by the anointed word of the
[2:07:28] hour Revelation upon Revelation upon
[2:07:33] Revelation that brings our minds subject
[2:07:35] to the word of
[2:07:40] God that we can see the word the way God
[2:07:43] sees
[2:07:46] it and we can see ourselves the way God
[2:07:49] sees us
[2:08:00] let the word of God bring into
[2:08:05] captivity if you have a single
[2:08:09] thing that disagrees with God's
[2:08:14] word in your
[2:08:16] mind you are powerless
[2:08:24] but may the Holy Spirit bring that into
[2:08:27] [Music]
[2:08:30] captivity to lose the power of God in
[2:08:32] your
[2:08:35] [Music]
[2:08:38] life listen church this is not skin milk
[2:08:41] this
[2:08:43] morning this is for Sons and Daughters
[2:08:45] of
[2:08:47] God who want to live as sons and
[2:08:50] daughters
[2:08:57] all
[2:08:59] right
[2:09:06] uhuh
[2:09:08] now let's go to the altar of
[2:09:14] incense now if this was the
[2:09:17] tabernacle and that was the outer Court
[2:09:21] and this was the Holy
[2:09:24] place and this was the holy of
[2:09:28] holies there would be a veil
[2:09:32] here and there would be an altar of
[2:09:34] incense right
[2:09:36] [Music]
[2:09:39] here so when the priest came to offer
[2:09:43] [Music]
[2:09:45] incense he was not facing the
[2:09:49] people he was facing eternity
[2:09:54] he was showing us where our prayers
[2:09:57] should be
[2:10:01] directed because incense represents our
[2:10:10] prayers and what lays beyond that
[2:10:16] Veil what lays in that room
[2:10:21] is the Shina
[2:10:23] Glory the priest would be
[2:10:26] here facing this
[2:10:29] way by
[2:10:30] faith offering
[2:10:34] incense to the God that he believed
[2:10:37] dwell
[2:10:39] [Music]
[2:10:40] there what dwelled there he didn't know
[2:10:44] that God like you know
[2:10:48] him what dwell there was the Eternal God
[2:10:54] what dwell there was the
[2:10:57] logos what dwell there was the Lamb's
[2:11:00] Book of
[2:11:03] Life what dwelt there was
[2:11:06] [Music]
[2:11:09] melchisedec listen
[2:11:10] folks this is what brother how brother
[2:11:12] Bram ties it
[2:11:16] together the priest doesn't understand
[2:11:19] it but now in this
[2:11:22] day you've been called to walk by
[2:11:24] Perfect
[2:11:26] [Music]
[2:11:27] Faith as Jesus walked by Perfect faith
[2:11:30] in what the word said he
[2:11:36] was so also you are to walk by Perfect
[2:11:42] faith in what the word says you
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:48] are not what the outer Court says you
[2:11:51] are
[2:11:54] [Applause]
[2:12:04] Hallelujah in the outer Court Jesus was
[2:12:07] the son of
[2:12:12] Joseph a carpenter
[2:12:15] son that's all they could
[2:12:18] see no beauty that they should desire
[2:12:23] but the reality is he was the King of
[2:12:25] Kings and the Lord of lords
[2:12:26] [Music]
[2:12:27] [Applause]
[2:12:32] [Music]
[2:12:35] Hallelujah he was of Glory dwelling in a
[2:12:38] body of
[2:12:43] Flesh and that same sh kind of
[2:12:47] Glory came back in the day of Pentecost
[2:12:52] and divided
[2:12:54] itself licks of fire upon each
[2:12:59] one that they could be born
[2:13:03] again God dwelling in
[2:13:06] them God taking up his residence in
[2:13:10] every
[2:13:15] Tabernacle in this
[2:13:17] Tabernacle in this Tabernacle in this
[2:13:20] Tabernacle
[2:13:22] amen hallelujah so now the daily
[2:13:26] Ministry of
[2:13:28] prayer we have to be
[2:13:31] careful because now we're approaching
[2:13:33] the altar of
[2:13:37] incense Zariah approached the offer of
[2:13:44] incense and he and he was offering
[2:13:48] incense for the prayers of the people in
[2:13:51] the outer
[2:13:54] court and an angel
[2:13:56] appeared where not in
[2:14:00] eternity but in the
[2:14:04] mind all right and
[2:14:08] Zachariah hears the voice of the
[2:14:11] Angel the angel says you're going to
[2:14:13] have a
[2:14:15] son and and he'll be the
[2:14:19] Forerunner and zachari
[2:14:22] says how shall these
[2:14:25] things in other words it's
[2:14:28] impossible my wife and I are
[2:14:31] Barren there's no
[2:14:34] possibility and the angel said it's
[2:14:36] going to happen
[2:14:39] [Music]
[2:14:40] anyway but because you doubt
[2:14:44] it there will be a consequence for your
[2:14:48] doubt oh learn the lesson of the word
[2:14:51] [Music]
[2:14:52] oh doubt cannot stop the purpose of God
[2:14:57] [Applause]
[2:15:02] hallelujah but there are consequences
[2:15:05] for
[2:15:09] doubt what was Zachariah
[2:15:12] doubting he wasn't doubting
[2:15:15] God he was doubting himself say it again
[2:15:19] he was doubting himself
[2:15:23] it's not
[2:15:26] possible I know what I
[2:15:28] am I look at myself from the outer
[2:15:35] Corner that's why when you approach the
[2:15:38] altar of
[2:15:39] incense you're to
[2:15:43] face you're to face towards
[2:15:47] eternity because in there
[2:15:51] is who you really
[2:15:54] are
[2:15:57] Hallelujah in there is the thoughts of
[2:16:01] God he has a VI before the foundation of
[2:16:05] the
[2:16:08] world that's why he said to
[2:16:11] Jeremiah tell
[2:16:13] Israel I know the thoughts I have
[2:16:16] concerning you
[2:16:20] [Music]
[2:16:22] people use that
[2:16:24] scripture as just positive
[2:16:30] thinking thoughts of and I can't
[2:16:32] remember the scripture thoughts of good
[2:16:33] and not of
[2:16:36] evil put it up there for me when you
[2:16:39] find
[2:16:41] it because in the mind of
[2:16:44] God there's no evil thoughts of
[2:16:49] you there it is Jeremiah
[2:16:53] 29:11 I know the thoughts I think
[2:16:56] towards
[2:17:00] you sayith the
[2:17:03] Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[2:17:09] evil to give you an expected
[2:17:14] end what is the expected
[2:17:18] end expected by God
[2:17:22] not you you don't have to figure it
[2:17:26] out he has an expectation of
[2:17:30] you that's why he comes to
[2:17:34] Gideon greetings th Mighty Man of
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:40] Val and Gideon's
[2:17:46] like is he are you talking to
[2:17:49] me thr in wine threshing wheat in the
[2:17:52] wine
[2:17:54] press hiding from the
[2:17:59] enemy oh he could have quoted this
[2:18:03] scripture but it hadn't been spoken
[2:18:07] yet I know the thoughts that I have of
[2:18:12] you hallelujah hallelujah so when you
[2:18:16] pray it's not Lord I'm nothing
[2:18:20] I'm just a sinner
[2:18:22] Lord I make so many
[2:18:25] mistakes I'm not worthy of
[2:18:28] anything you're just confessing the
[2:18:30] outer
[2:18:33] Court that's not what you're to
[2:18:36] confess because prayer is
[2:18:40] confession he's the high priest of our
[2:18:44] confession the high priest is in
[2:18:49] there we make profession in
[2:18:54] prayer
[2:18:55] Lord Our
[2:18:58] Father Who Art in
[2:19:00] Heaven other words I'm your
[2:19:03] son I'm your
[2:19:06] attribute come on Saints I'm part of
[2:19:10] you I've been redeemed by the blood of
[2:19:13] the
[2:19:14] Lamb I know when I come before you in
[2:19:18] prayer you don't see me
[2:19:21] you don't see my
[2:19:23] mistakes you see the perfect blood of
[2:19:25] the
[2:19:26] [Music]
[2:19:28] Lamb I'm not here to claim anything on
[2:19:31] my own
[2:19:36] merits but I'm here to claim every
[2:19:39] promise that has been made by the
[2:19:45] lamb paid for by his blood
[2:19:51] Hallelujah there's so many places we
[2:19:53] could take this but we need to bring it
[2:19:55] to a
[2:19:57] close when the same angel that visited
[2:20:02] Zachariah said Zachariah you'll be dumb
[2:20:06] until this comes to
[2:20:08] pass because you doubted
[2:20:11] it didn't stop it from coming to
[2:20:17] pass but Zachariah you'll pay the price
[2:20:23] he went
[2:20:24] home they had a child just like the
[2:20:26] angel
[2:20:28] said then in another place the same
[2:20:31] Angel comes to a young
[2:20:36] woman and she doesn't have all the
[2:20:38] complexes that Zachariah
[2:20:41] [Music]
[2:20:44] had she doesn't have all the baggage
[2:20:46] that he has
[2:20:51] she's just a
[2:20:52] believer and she hears the word of the
[2:20:56] Angel and she says be it unto me
[2:20:58] according to Thy
[2:21:02] word it's just that
[2:21:05] simple Lord I have a
[2:21:07] need be it unto me according to your
[2:21:12] word daily
[2:21:16] ministration feeding on the word
[2:21:21] trimming the
[2:21:23] lamp and confessing the right
[2:21:29] confession if you're going to
[2:21:32] doubt if you are going to
[2:21:35] doubt doubt your
[2:21:38] [Music]
[2:21:40] doubts doubt your
[2:21:44] feelings doubt the lying vanities
[2:21:50] turn your face towards the Holy
[2:21:56] Temple turn your face towards
[2:22:00] eternity where your representation
[2:22:03] dwells
[2:22:03] [Applause]
[2:22:05] there and say oh great
[2:22:09] Jehovah Lord Jesus
[2:22:11] Christ be it unto
[2:22:13] me according to thy
[2:22:18] thoughts hallelu
[2:22:21] let's Stand
[2:22:23] Together daily
[2:22:26] [Music]
[2:22:28] ministration be it unto me according to
[2:22:31] Thy
[2:22:33] word I don't want to go any further this
[2:22:38] morning but I wonder if we bow our heads
[2:22:41] this
[2:22:43] morning maybe somebody's here that's not
[2:22:45] going to be here
[2:22:48] tonight but there's some that wants to
[2:22:51] say Lord I don't want to live in the
[2:22:52] outer
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:22:55] Court I want to move into the holy of
[2:23:00] Holiness I want everything of my
[2:23:04] being to be oriented towards the
[2:23:07] [Music]
[2:23:11] Eternal we're going to hear about this
[2:23:13] in detail
[2:23:16] tonight the reality of the Eternal
[2:23:20] [Music]
[2:23:22] but if that's your
[2:23:23] desire as we
[2:23:25] pray why don't you just lift your
[2:23:28] hand Heavenly Father we have laid out
[2:23:32] your
[2:23:34] word that your
[2:23:36] children might understand
[2:23:40] themselves the battles they go
[2:23:43] through the struggles of
[2:23:46] life that's why we're
[2:23:49] here your molding our
[2:23:51] [Music]
[2:23:53] character you're bringing us
[2:23:56] Lord into the very stature of Jesus
[2:24:01] Christ for he is the firstborn among
[2:24:04] many
[2:24:06] [Music]
[2:24:08] brethren we are not your
[2:24:12] fullness but we are
[2:24:16] you there is a part of
[2:24:18] us that is
[2:24:21] Eternal everything else will pass
[2:24:25] away complexes will pass
[2:24:29] away bitterness will pass
[2:24:34] away but that which is written in
[2:24:37] heaven will never pass
[2:24:40] away so Lord take every life under your
[2:24:43] hand this
[2:24:47] morning make each one what you want them
[2:24:50] to
[2:24:54] be bring your word to pass in their
[2:24:59] lives and Lord as they open their not
[2:25:02] just their hearts but their minds to
[2:25:08] you may the Holy Spirit take the
[2:25:13] word and wash them in the water of the
[2:25:18] world until they see them eles standing

[2:26:00] this was very good teaching of the
[2:26:04] word you know how
[2:26:08] God took
[2:26:11] Moses and says I want to show you the
[2:26:15] pattern of the temple that you are going
[2:26:18] to build
[2:26:20] Moses saw the
[2:26:22] reality and he brought it here on Earth
[2:26:25] in simple
[2:26:27] form every part of that
[2:26:31] Temple was a great
[2:26:35] detail that should teach
[2:26:38] us on how we walk with God here on
[2:26:43] Earth you see I liked it when we see
[2:26:46] that God
[2:26:50] in the holy of
[2:26:52] holies and the men of God all
[2:26:57] Israel They Knew by
[2:27:00] faith that God lived behind those Bader
[2:27:05] skins so I want you to see your
[2:27:09] soul as that you know holy of
[2:27:13] holies when the temple was laid
[2:27:20] God entered in
[2:27:22] there and he never
[2:27:25] left he was always there and so you know
[2:27:30] God is in the
[2:27:33] soul but our daily
[2:27:36] life is R from the spirit
[2:27:40] real that's where you think
[2:27:43] from that's where you plan
[2:27:45] from that's where you have all the bad
[2:27:48] Troubles of your life
[2:27:52] so our daily
[2:27:54] walk is where we continually
[2:27:58] sin and it's in this
[2:28:01] room where we need a daily
[2:28:07] sacrifice that's why they were always in
[2:28:09] that middle room the
[2:28:12] priest but as far as the life at the
[2:28:16] center of the
[2:28:19] Soul it was
[2:28:21] established it was
[2:28:24] present it was there and I want you to
[2:28:28] know as a child of
[2:28:30] God that when God gets at the center of
[2:28:34] your
[2:28:35] soul he doesn't
[2:28:38] leave he doesn't go in every
[2:28:42] soul but he goes into the soul of the
[2:28:47] predestinated amen and as the Brothers
[2:28:50] told us the
[2:28:53] predestinated they already had their
[2:28:57] representation they had a body in the
[2:28:59] heavens and that's the reason why they
[2:29:03] believe so if what youres if your
[2:29:07] representation was
[2:29:11] eternal then what will God
[2:29:14] do with that
[2:29:17] representation if you fail
[2:29:24] how will God deal with
[2:29:27] it will he throw eternal life in
[2:29:33] hell so you see we have to deal with our
[2:29:39] spiritual failures on a daily
[2:29:44] [Music]
[2:29:46] basis and I want you to look at your
[2:29:48] brother
[2:29:50] the way God looks at
[2:29:52] him not the way you want to see
[2:29:55] him but the way God
[2:29:58] sees amen so I I want to say something
[2:30:03] here that if God constantly dwelt in the
[2:30:07] holy of
[2:30:09] holies he constantly dwells in your
[2:30:13] soul and now in the
[2:30:17] soul the Holy Spirit
[2:30:20] where he
[2:30:21] dwells he seeks to have
[2:30:25] preeminence Amen to take over your
[2:30:31] reasoning take over your
[2:30:34] affection to take over your
[2:30:37] choices that God now extends his
[2:30:43] control over your human
[2:30:46] spirit so the Holy Spirit takes over
[2:30:50] where the elements you want to work
[2:30:53] from the elements is like your
[2:30:57] education like the
[2:30:59] politics like the
[2:31:02] culture where it wants to
[2:31:05] control the Holy Spirit desires to take
[2:31:08] over
[2:31:09] that and every day the holy spirit will
[2:31:14] have something to point
[2:31:16] out and then you run back to the blood
[2:31:20] not that you are not alive on
[2:31:23] side but he's protecting the
[2:31:27] environment the surrounding where God
[2:31:30] dwell Hallelujah in the holy of holies I
[2:31:35] want to say there was
[2:31:37] maturity there was life when the RO of
[2:31:41] Aon got
[2:31:43] there it doesn't matter how old it was
[2:31:47] it come back to life again
[2:31:50] that's what's on the side of allow any
[2:31:53] promise to get in there and God will
[2:31:56] give it
[2:31:57] life are you together with me as long as
[2:32:01] it was in there it began to produce
[2:32:04] Galatians
[2:32:06] 5 it brought forth the fruit of the
[2:32:10] spirit are you together with me so we
[2:32:13] really appreciate God that God can speak
[2:32:16] to
[2:32:17] us I heard the brother
[2:32:21] believing is in the
[2:32:23] mind but faith is in the
[2:32:33] soul are you together with so in my mind
[2:32:38] let me have eternal
[2:32:41] thoughts when I hear the word I don't
[2:32:45] want to hear it like somebody would hear
[2:32:48] it from the outside
[2:32:50] I want to hear it like I'm hearing it
[2:32:53] from the mouth of
[2:32:55] God because the word of God when it
[2:32:59] comes to you it never goes back forward
[2:33:03] without fulfilling what sent are you
[2:33:06] together with me faith in the
[2:33:09] soul does not
[2:33:11] stugger because it's managed by
[2:33:14] God Amen on side there so let our faith
[2:33:20] look towards
[2:33:22] eternity because the word is already
[2:33:26] established whenever the word comes to
[2:33:29] you it's already
[2:33:31] established that's what
[2:33:33] Zariah failed to know that's what you
[2:33:37] struggle for amen don't be like Zar be
[2:33:42] like a Mary it to be me according to Thy
[2:33:46] word amen when you say let it
[2:33:51] you have opened the door to
[2:33:53] the and there the word
[2:34:00] becomes you see is very
[2:34:04] wonderful this was very good
[2:34:08] teaching let the word step
[2:34:11] inside and let the word
[2:34:14] confess and let it become life I am a
[2:34:18] son of God
[2:34:20] I come from God I'm going back to God
[2:34:24] are you together with me that's what you
[2:34:26] should always
[2:34:28] say amen and once a brother
[2:34:32] confesses shake his
[2:34:34] hand amen because he's speaking the mind
[2:34:38] of
[2:34:39] God about
[2:34:41] himself he's confessing and God is
[2:34:45] giving life to his confession
[2:34:51] don't go walking around
[2:35:00] and and then you start pointing at
[2:35:07] people
[2:35:14] that's God bless you brother Moses
[2:35:19] do you love him this
[2:35:21] afternoon do you appreciate our
[2:35:24] brother amen is coming to give
[2:35:28] more amen today let red be against
[2:35:34] red amen and let you be as white as
[2:35:39] snow amen just open that
[2:35:42] gate because in there is
[2:35:46] maturity hallelujah hallelujah in there
[2:35:49] is eternal life in there the man never
[2:35:53] di so
[2:35:55] allow what you hear not end
[2:36:00] here God I'm opening my
[2:36:08] soul God is
[2:36:11] good what God made
[2:36:15] sure is that he's on the throne
[2:36:20] and he
[2:36:21] controlled and
[2:36:23] Israel
[2:36:25] believed that God was behind those B
[2:36:31] skins and God deals with that seed
[2:36:36] gin that's the M the female
[2:36:39] part and God
[2:36:42] comes and then there is an invisible
[2:36:46] Union amen amen and out of there life
[2:36:50] becomes to flow
[2:36:53] out God bless
[2:36:58] you let us be here in the
