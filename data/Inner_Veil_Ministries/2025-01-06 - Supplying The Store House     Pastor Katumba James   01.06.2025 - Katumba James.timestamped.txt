[20:24] Lord the word is ready to be ministered
[20:26] Lord to our souls Lord. We present
[20:29] ourselves before you Lord. We come Lord
[20:31] Jesus with boldiness Lord to come and
[20:34] partake father of the heavenly nature
[20:37] Lord which is through the word of Jesus
[20:39] Christ. Lord Jesus Christ we thank you
[20:41] for the ministry father of the bride
[20:43] which is moving on Lord until the coming
[20:46] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Lord help our
[20:49] unbelief. Lord help our shortcomings
[20:51] Lord. Sometimes when we feel weary Lord

[20:57] come by wings Lord and lift us up Lord
[20:59] on higher grounds Lord Jesus I commit
[21:02] the service at your hand. I commit
[21:04] father the minister Lord is ready to
[21:06] prepare is ready to talk to your
[21:08] children Lord I pray Lord Jesus as we
[21:11] come before you as we know Lord Jesus
[21:14] that you are the door Lord you are at
[21:16] the door you are knocking father it is
[21:18] an individual affair Lord Jesus I commit
[21:21] father ourselves to you Lord Jesus that
[21:24] you may open Lord our ears of faith that
[21:27] you may open our spiritual ears Lord
[21:29] that we may hear the knock of Christ
[21:32] because he says behold They stand at the
[21:34] door. Lord Jesus Christ, we know,
[21:36] Father, in the days of Noah, Lord, when
[21:39] Noah sat on the ark, Lord, there was,
[21:42] Father, the hand came out, Father, and
[21:45] it locked the door. And one of these
[21:47] days, Lord, the door is going to be
[21:49] shut. Not by the ministers, Lord, not by
[21:52] the believers, Lord, but the Lord Jesus
[21:54] himself is going to lock the door. But
[21:57] Lord Jesus before that time comes before
[21:59] the end of uh gentile dispensations Lord
[22:02] we pray Lord Jesus that we may receive
[22:04] the spirit of God that we may be
[22:07] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[22:09] Lord Jesus because that is the token
[22:11] father that is the demand of the spirit
[22:14] that we may be like the spirit because
[22:16] the scripture says he that heareth my
[22:19] word and believeth on him that sent me
[22:22] has everlasting life and we know Lord
[22:25] Jesus Christ we've who passed from death
[22:27] unto life. And I pray for the younger
[22:29] ones, Lord, who have gotten into this
[22:31] message, Lord. May you bind them, Lord,
[22:33] with your yolks of bondage, Lord, that
[22:36] they yolks of love, Lord, that they may
[22:38] be prisoners of love, Lord Jesus Christ,
[22:41] like Paul was a prisoner, Lord. I pray,
[22:44] Lord Jesus, enlighten your goodness,
[22:46] Lord. Enlighten your mercies, Lord.
[22:49] Shade, Father, abandon your grace, Lord.
[22:52] As the scripture says, God, you are rich
[22:54] in mercy and you receive mercies new
[22:57] every morning, Lord Jesus. That's why we
[23:00] depend upon you, Lord. We thank you,
[23:02] Lord Jesus. We guard, have mercy, Lord
[23:04] God, on us, Lord. Lord
[23:07] Jesus, Lord, we are in this world,
[23:09] Father, full of father deception, Lord,
[23:13] deception of the devil. That's why
[23:15] people don't mind, Lord. But we know
[23:17] Lord Jesus our eyes have been
[23:19] enlightened Lord with the eyeselves Lord
[23:22] and that is the Holy Spirit of God. We
[23:24] thank you Lord Jesus. We give you glory
[23:26] and honor Lord. Oh hallelujah. Come and
[23:30] prevail Lord Jesus. We love you Lord. We
[23:33] appreciate you
[23:35] Jesus. In the name of our Lord Jesus I
[23:38] prayed. Amen. Amen. Give him a hand of
[23:42] praise.

[23:50] Let us get on our feet as we as the
[23:53] deacon prepares the
[23:59] minister and have that
[24:04] confession which says Jesus is my
[24:08] savior. Nothing is going to shake me.

[40:59] to I believe the Lord will give me
[41:02] grace.
[41:06] Then he was telling me there is a ferry
[41:08] from Chindi.
[41:10] A ferry.
[41:17] Then he was telling me you can even come
[41:19] with your vehicle. You park inside it
[41:20] and you go to the
[41:26] island. I believe I need more faith to
[41:28] cross the
[41:31] water. But we thank God for the grace he
[41:34] has given him over there.
[41:37] actually his elder brother passed away I
[41:40] think over the last week.
[41:44] So I was traveling on Friday for the
[41:47] burial and I believe that's why he's
[41:49] passing by here at
[41:51] fellowship. Praise the name of our Lord.
[41:54] Brother Kawa lost somebody in his
[41:58] family. The mother lost I think the
[42:01] mother the wife lost the
[42:04] mother. So we just need to give him
[42:07] support those able to stand with him in
[42:10] going for the
[42:12] burial or any kind of
[42:15] support that will be very good. Praise
[42:18] the name of our Lord. There is a
[42:20] testimony here before we
[42:23] continue says God bless you
[42:26] saints. I thank the Lord for healing
[42:29] mercies he has given when I've been down
[42:32] for two
[42:34] weeks. I thank the pastor for the
[42:36] support and prayers of all the
[42:40] saints standing with me in
[42:42] prayers,
[42:44] encouragement, financially,
[42:48] physically and then
[42:50] visitations. May the Almighty God bless
[42:52] you so
[42:54] much. Honor and glory be back to our
[42:57] great
[43:00] physician, the Lord Jesus Christ. This
[43:03] from our sister.
[43:07] Praise the name of the Lord. Remember
[43:09] last Sunday were not able to be at
[43:12] church but God helped them to come
[43:14] through. Then on Wednesday they came and
[43:17] attended the evening
[43:19] service but her condition worsened on
[43:22] Wednesday night.
[43:25] that take her to main
[43:26] hospital but we thank God have been able
[43:29] to come today for
[43:31] services. Amen. We just need to stand
[43:34] with one
[43:35] another in the challenges that we
[43:38] face. So pastor went to
[43:42] do and he has been preaching since
[43:46] Friday and he's ending today. So keep
[43:48] him in your
[43:51] prayers. Praise the name of our Lord.
[43:54] Today we have two
[43:55] services. I believe we have come ready
[43:58] for the two
[44:00] services. The after the second
[44:03] service we shall have the Lord's supper
[44:06] at
[44:08] 5:00 and then the foot
[44:11] washing. Then next Sunday we have only
[44:13] one
[44:15] service. Praise the name of our Lord. I
[44:18] want to appreciate those who came for
[44:19] the Friday overnight. Brother Dan and
[44:22] all the other brethren.
[44:27] I personally missed
[44:29] coming. I wanted really to
[44:32] come but I found that almost at home I
[44:35] needed to be there to keep the
[44:39] place because my wife had gone to with
[44:42] her back to
[44:46] school and the people would call to come
[44:48] and keep home were also going to be in
[44:50] church.
[44:53] So I just had to keep at home. I believe
[44:56] it was it was a good
[44:59] overnight. Praise the name
[45:01] of. So
[45:03] on 22nd of
[45:08] June that is two Sundays away from
[45:12] now. We are hosting brother Andreas from
[45:18] German. Praise the name of Lord.
[45:21] So we really need to see that we come up
[45:24] to support these
[45:28] meetings. Praise the name of our Lord.
[45:31] So I would really call upon your
[45:34] support because we want to invite the
[45:37] new churches especially the ministers to
[45:39] come and be with
[45:43] us such that they can benefit from the
[45:46] ministry of brother Andreas.
[45:50] So we shall need to contribute for
[45:55] food for all of us here that
[45:58] day and then even for the transport of
[46:01] these ministers we want to
[46:04] bring and we shall need about 2 million
[46:09] shillings 1 million for the
[46:12] food 1 million for the
[46:15] transportation. So I call upon you to
[46:17] support
[46:19] Praise the name of our Lord and don't be
[46:23] weary. Praise the name of our Lord. No
[46:26] needs are
[46:28] continuous but the Lord open to
[46:32] supply. Praise the name of our Lord. I
[46:34] would call sister faith and to come and
[46:36] say before God the reading of the
[46:49] word. So today we are going to preach on
[46:53] supplying the
[46:59] storehouse. And this is the
[47:02] storehouse.
[47:23] eliminated. God bless you.
[47:28] That night I lay in
[47:32] bed and
[47:35] I begin to cry.
[47:45] And my mind just
[47:48] fails to
[47:50] know
[47:53] exactly why.
[48:00] I can't
[48:03] explain with tongue
[48:07] open the spirit
[48:10] groing
[48:12] deep within.
[48:16] It must be
[48:19] God here in my
[48:22] soul. Cuz I
[48:25] feel the pool.
[48:31] I
[48:32] feel the cold.
[48:38] Oh, I
[48:40] hear the
[48:45] [Music]
[48:47] poor and his
[48:51] spirit

[49:56] spirit

[50:15] Oh, and
[50:23] I Lord, please

[50:29] take
[50:31] control. I
[50:33] feel the P.
[50:37] [Music]
[50:41] I went to hear the
[50:45] word and
[50:47] read in each line and
[50:52] [Music]
[50:56] prayer. Oh, he was drawing
[51:00] me to
[51:03] give a
[51:05] higher praise.
[51:09] [Music]
[51:12] There's a
[51:15] deep call to the
[51:18] deep like a great magnet
[51:24] pulling me.
[51:27] I know for
[51:30] sure that I'll reach the
[51:33] goal. Cuz I
[51:36] feel the P.
[51:42] I
[51:43] feel
[51:47] the
[51:49] Oh, I
[51:52] [Music]

[53:18] Amen.
[53:22] Amen. You feel the pool.
[53:25] Praise the name of the Lord. Thank you
[53:27] for the song. I fill the pool.
[53:31] Praise the name of our Lord. So I
[53:34] request we stand up and go to our
[53:37] Bibles. We're reading in Malachi
[53:42] 3 verse 7 to verse
[53:49] 12. Let us pray first. Father, we thank
[53:53] you Lord. We surely feel the
[53:57] pull that that's why you've come here in
[54:00] your
[54:01] presence. We want to appreciate for your
[54:03] presence in our
[54:05] midst may break unto us the bread of
[54:10] life. For it is by the word of
[54:13] God that we were
[54:15] created and by obedience to the word of
[54:19] God we are able to serve you
[54:22] Lord. Bless us heavenly father.
[54:25] and help us dear Lord
[54:27] Jesus that our hearts and our
[54:31] mind may be willing father to do what
[54:35] you tell us to
[54:36] do and help us not to
[54:39] doubt but have
[54:41] faith and be
[54:43] obedient. We love you and we thank you
[54:46] Lord in the name of the Lord
[54:50] Jesus. Amen. Amen. So let us go to
[54:53] Malachi chapter 3.
[54:56] And then verse
[54:57] seven up to verse
[55:00] 12, the Bible says, "Even from the days
[55:04] of your fathers, you are gone away from
[55:06] mine ordinances and have not kept them.
[55:10] Return unto me and I will return unto
[55:13] you, says the Lord of hosts." But you
[55:16] said, "Wherein shall we return?
[55:46] Will a man rob God? Yet have yet ye have
[55:51] robbed me? But you say, "Wherein have we
[55:54] robbed thee?" In tithes and offerings.
[55:59] [Music]
[56:18] You are cursed with a curse, for you
[56:20] have robbed me, even the whole nation.
[56:33] Bring ye all the tithes into the
[56:35] storehouse, that there may be meat in
[56:38] mine house, and prove me now herewith,
[56:41] says the Lord of hosts, if I will not
[56:44] open you the windows of heaven, and pour
[56:47] you out a blessing, that there shall not
[56:50] be room enough to receive it.
[57:14] And I will rebuke the divvara for your
[57:16] sakes, and he shall not destroy the
[57:19] fruits of your ground, neither shall
[57:21] your vine cast her fruit before the time
[57:24] in the field, says the Lord of hosts.
[57:43] And all nations shall call ye blessed,
[57:47] for you shall be a delightsome land,
[57:49] says the Lord of Hosts.
[58:00] Amen. The goodness of his
[58:02] word is seated.
[58:05] So today I want to share on supplying
[58:07] the
[58:10] storehouse. And then the
[58:13] storehouse we are talking about is the
[58:17] church. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[58:20] you know the Bible says bring the tithes
[58:23] and
[58:26] offerings. Praise the name of our Lord.
[58:29] And we always keep a record of those who
[58:31] paid the
[58:33] [Music]
[58:36] tith. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[58:39] the Bible is telling us when we go back
[58:43] to verse seven.
[58:46] He said, "You have gone away from mine
[58:52] ordinances and you have not kept
[58:56] them." And then he says, "Return unto
[59:00] me, and I will return unto you, says the
[59:04] Lord of hosts." But he said where shall
[59:07] we
[59:09] return? And then the Lord gives the
[59:12] reasons for
[59:14] returning. He says you have robbed
[59:17] me. Then he said how have we robbed
[59:21] God. He says in tithes and
[59:26] offerings. It is our
[59:28] obligation. Praise the name of Lord to
[59:31] pay our
[59:33] taxes and
[59:35] obligations in the message let us see
[59:38] God. But you know I feel like
[59:42] this a member of a
[59:46] church their first
[59:49] obligation is with their tithe and
[59:55] offering is to support their church.
[1:00:00] Praise the name of our God. If you are
[1:00:03] members of these fine
[1:00:05] churches that is represented
[1:00:08] here, you support your
[1:00:11] church. That is your first duty to
[1:00:16] God. Bring your tithe and offerings into
[1:00:19] the
[1:00:22] storehouse. And the
[1:00:24] storehouse, you surely know what that
[1:00:26] is.
[1:00:29] It is where you get your
[1:00:32] food. So there is where you get your
[1:00:35] spiritual
[1:00:36] food and your
[1:00:40] obligation is to your
[1:00:42] church and not to an evangelist like
[1:00:46] me. So he was telling the
[1:00:49] people you know bring your tithes and
[1:00:52] offerings to the
[1:00:55] storehouse and the
[1:00:57] storehouse is the church like our church
[1:01:01] here before God is what is the
[1:01:05] storehouse is telling us. Bring your
[1:01:09] tithes, bring your
[1:01:12] offerings. Praise the name of God. And
[1:01:15] you know
[1:01:16] God has even put a blessing upon
[1:01:20] it. He says test
[1:01:23] me try me. Praise the name of Lord. You
[1:01:28] know in Malachi chapter 3 and verse
[1:01:31] 10. He says bring all your tithes into
[1:01:35] the
[1:01:39] storehouse that there may be meat in
[1:01:42] mine house.
[1:01:45] In other words, there should be
[1:01:47] abundancy
[1:01:49] here. Just as we come to get the
[1:01:52] spiritual
[1:01:53] word, then the natural things we should
[1:01:56] meant to supply
[1:01:58] them. Praise the name of Lord such that
[1:02:01] you know the work of God is not damaged.
[1:02:07] And then he says, "And prove me
[1:02:09] now
[1:02:11] herewith, says the Lord of
[1:02:14] hosts, if I will not open you the
[1:02:17] windows of
[1:02:19] heaven and pour you out a
[1:02:23] blessing that there may be no room
[1:02:26] enough to receive
[1:02:28] it." Praise the name of Lord. You know,
[1:02:31] we want God to bless us, but here is a
[1:02:34] sure way to bless.
[1:02:39] says, "Bring your
[1:02:40] tes, bring your
[1:02:43] offerings. Praise the name of you know
[1:02:45] you don't bring
[1:02:47] it
[1:02:48] saying I got
[1:02:51] little have a
[1:02:52] lot." So you're doing it to the
[1:02:56] Lord. Praise the name of There was a
[1:02:59] brother I was
[1:03:01] told and then he went and visited the
[1:03:03] pastor's place.
[1:03:06] And when he reached the brother was
[1:03:09] blind and so when he visited the the
[1:03:12] pastor's
[1:03:14] place and then you know he was being
[1:03:16] told you know you need to pay
[1:03:19] tith and then the brother was
[1:03:25] saying that of all these things I see
[1:03:28] that the pastor is blind
[1:03:33] but the
[1:03:36] Now get on my man and give him
[1:03:40] attitude and so you stay
[1:03:44] poor. You remain down
[1:03:48] there. You have eternal life but all the
[1:03:52] time you in
[1:03:53] debt. This
[1:03:57] dead you have eternal
[1:03:59] life but the physical things you are
[1:04:02] doing bad.
[1:04:05] Either you don't want to work and when
[1:04:08] you work you don't want to pay
[1:04:10] taxes or if you are
[1:04:13] working the moment you get the
[1:04:16] money and the Bible talks about
[1:04:22] devir just come and take your
[1:04:25] money. You have money
[1:04:28] there, then you move along the
[1:04:31] market, then you get
[1:04:36] those this one is right, this one is
[1:04:38] wrong, and then you want to make more
[1:04:39] money and then you put there
[1:04:46] banged and then sometimes the divvara
[1:04:49] comes in your
[1:04:51] home,
[1:04:54] sickness, very expensive
[1:04:57] All the money is
[1:05:00] gone. But what's wrong with
[1:05:03] me? Or
[1:05:05] sometimes things break into your
[1:05:08] house, they steal something you've
[1:05:10] worked for 5 years or 10
[1:05:14] years or sometimes your bosses cheat
[1:05:19] you because these things are happening.
[1:05:22] I've worked the whole year. I've not got
[1:05:24] money.
[1:05:26] First ask yourself, do I pay my
[1:05:29] tithes? Do I pay my
[1:05:31] offerings? That's where you start
[1:05:34] from. You do a
[1:05:37] selfexamination. Why is this upon
[1:05:40] you? Then you can go with the scriptures
[1:05:42] before
[1:05:44] God. Say,
[1:05:46] Lord, you said we prove
[1:05:49] you. I've been paying my tithe. I've
[1:05:52] been paying my offerings.
[1:05:54] But why is this devour
[1:05:58] coming? Praise the name of our Lord. But
[1:06:01] he says, "Prove
[1:06:04] me if I will not open the windows of
[1:06:07] heaven to
[1:06:09] you." So now God requires
[1:06:12] us. He says, "It is my
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:18] ordinance. Do what I tell you to
[1:06:21] do and I will bless you.
[1:06:24] Praise the name of Lord. So it's our
[1:06:28] obligation to pay our
[1:06:31] taxes and our
[1:06:33] offerings. Now
[1:06:35] God cannot require you to pay
[1:06:40] anything if he has not given
[1:06:43] you. That's how God is
[1:06:46] gracious. By the time he asks you, he
[1:06:50] has already given from you.
[1:06:53] That's what he does. So if you don't
[1:06:57] earn, he's not asking you from anything.
[1:07:00] But then the reason is why don't you
[1:07:04] earn? Praise the name of Lord. If you
[1:07:07] are mature enough, you mean you don't
[1:07:09] want to
[1:07:10] work or you are
[1:07:12] crippled or maybe you know you can't do
[1:07:17] anything but get something you lay your
[1:07:19] hands
[1:07:21] on and whatever little they are paying
[1:07:24] you. Thank God for the
[1:07:26] little if they are paying me 5,000 a
[1:07:30] day. Lord, I thank you for the
[1:07:33] madam that money may not be enough to
[1:07:35] take you
[1:07:37] through, but get 500 shillings from
[1:07:42] 5,000. Bring your
[1:07:45] tithe, however little it
[1:07:47] is. You look at fulfilling the word of
[1:07:52] God, not how much you
[1:07:55] bringing. Praise the name of our don't
[1:07:58] say, Lord, first give me more money,
[1:07:59] then I give you.
[1:08:02] The Bible says if you are faithful in
[1:08:04] the
[1:08:05] little you are faithful in the much. Now
[1:08:08] if you are faithful in the
[1:08:12] little 5,000 a day how will he give you
[1:08:16] 50,000
[1:08:25] day you know he has given me 10 50,000
[1:08:28] now we have to take
[1:08:30] 5,000 that's too much money let me
[1:08:34] reduce you are cheating
[1:08:36] yourself and he says you have robbed
[1:08:40] me. So now we need to see that we are
[1:08:42] faithful in the little that God has
[1:08:46] given and that little God has given
[1:08:50] you magnify
[1:08:52] it be something bigger
[1:08:55] than but we need to change our
[1:08:58] attitude. Praise the name of our Lord
[1:09:01] and when you are coming to
[1:09:02] church praise the name of our
[1:09:05] Lord. You know there are scriptures I
[1:09:07] was reading
[1:09:08] here maybe I can pick
[1:09:11] it. Let us go to Deuteronomy chapter
[1:09:18] 16 and then verse
[1:09:23] 15. He says
[1:09:26] seven days shalt thou keep a solemn
[1:09:28] feast unto the Lord thy God in the place
[1:09:31] which the Lord shall choose.
[1:09:48] Because the Lord thy God shall bless you
[1:09:52] in all thine increase and in all the
[1:09:55] works of thine hands. Therefore thou
[1:09:58] shalt surely rejoice.
[1:10:14] Three times in a year shall all thy
[1:10:17] males appear before the Lord thy God in
[1:10:21] the place which he shall choose.
[1:10:32] in the feast of the unleavened bread and
[1:10:35] in the feast of weeks and in the feast
[1:10:37] of tabernacles. And they shall not
[1:10:40] appear before the Lord empty.
[1:10:57] He says, "I will bless you in your
[1:11:00] work. I will give you an
[1:11:04] income
[1:11:06] brother." Hey brother, this week has
[1:11:09] been very hard. What have you been
[1:11:11] eating? Lorx,
[1:11:14] but there's no free Lorx.
[1:11:25] You know Monday got some job to I got
[1:11:29] 7,000 on Tuesday I didn't have a
[1:11:31] job and then on Wednesday I got a
[1:11:35] job from Wednesday not even had money to
[1:11:41] eat 15,000 a week you've made 17,000 a
[1:11:46] week and when you come to
[1:11:50] church. The condition has been so
[1:11:53] bad. You know, I just worked two times
[1:11:56] this
[1:11:57] week. All the money I didn't have
[1:12:00] something to eat and I just ate
[1:12:02] it and God says you were
[1:12:06] rob now. What would I have
[1:12:10] done? Now you have eaten the
[1:12:13] money and this one who provides for you
[1:12:16] is the one you are robbing. So what are
[1:12:17] you going to
[1:12:19] do? So he says you have robbed
[1:12:23] me and then he says when you when I've
[1:12:26] blessed
[1:12:27] you don't come
[1:12:32] empty-handed. Oh you know we
[1:12:34] got and this thing happened. So for you
[1:12:37] instead of coming to appreciate what the
[1:12:40] Lord has done for
[1:12:42] you, your tithes and offering,
[1:12:47] the week has been so hard.
[1:12:50] The week has been so hard. How about
[1:12:51] coming empty?
[1:12:59] Then he says,
[1:13:02] don't appear before the Lord empty.
[1:13:08] Even 100
[1:13:09] shillings. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:13:12] Lord appreciates it because you are
[1:13:15] giving it from your
[1:13:17] heart. What the Lord has blessed you
[1:13:20] with and the Lord out of what you've
[1:13:22] given you, I'm bringing back
[1:13:25] this. Praise the name of God. And then
[1:13:28] in verse
[1:13:29] 17, it says, "Every man shall give as he
[1:13:34] is
[1:13:38] able, according to the blessing of the
[1:13:43] Lord, thy God which he has given thee."
[1:13:53] So you don't account on someone's
[1:13:55] someone else's money. uh if my job I was
[1:13:58] getting a million shillings I would be
[1:14:00] paying
[1:14:03] tithe just a
[1:14:05] million I would be paying my tithe and
[1:14:08] now I'm getting only
[1:14:11] 150,000 how can I pay
[1:14:13] tithe we robbing
[1:14:16] God says every
[1:14:19] man shall give as he is
[1:14:23] able now that ability
[1:14:27] is what according to God has given
[1:14:31] you. According to the blessing of the
[1:14:35] Lord thy
[1:14:40] God which he has given
[1:14:43] thee. So start asking
[1:14:46] yourself what has God given me this
[1:14:49] week. Praise the name of what has God
[1:14:52] given me this week. And from what God
[1:14:55] has given me this
[1:14:57] week, I come and present it before the
[1:15:02] Lord this
[1:15:03] week because your
[1:15:06] confession or your
[1:15:08] testimony is when you are giving
[1:15:12] back, Lord. I've got 10,000 this
[1:15:16] week. I'm bringing my 1,000 as my
[1:15:20] t. The Bible says tithe and
[1:15:25] offering. Okay, let me give 1,000 my
[1:15:29] tithe. Let me give my 500 shillings as
[1:15:33] my Lord will appreciate
[1:15:35] that because you are
[1:15:38] recognizing that the Lord has given me
[1:15:41] here and he's telling me bring
[1:15:44] here and he's not asking you for what he
[1:15:46] has given you all of
[1:15:49] it. as I've given you all
[1:15:51] this all
[1:15:53] this. Now if you are complaining about
[1:15:55] giving a
[1:15:58] little then God knows you don't have
[1:16:00] faith to give the whole of
[1:16:03] it. So he gets
[1:16:07] individuals whom he
[1:16:09] knows that if I give this one
[1:16:13] this he will give me the whole of this
[1:16:16] year. And the Lord does that in those
[1:16:19] people who can be able to
[1:16:23] know. Praise the name of our Lord. God
[1:16:26] does it.
[1:16:28] Praise the name of our Lord. Like now
[1:16:31] there is a brother. Oh, actually this
[1:16:34] morning I was reading about a
[1:16:37] sister and she was in South Africa,
[1:16:40] South Africa and you know those days she
[1:16:43] she had cows
[1:16:45] but the currency was strong. They were
[1:16:47] using pounds at that time. They were
[1:16:49] using pounds as their currency.
[1:16:54] So she she was God put a burden upon
[1:16:57] her. I want you to get 80
[1:17:03] 80. She didn't have the money. She sold
[1:17:07] the
[1:17:07] cow. But the car was only going instead
[1:17:10] of 240 the price of the cow would only
[1:17:13] fetch that money.
[1:17:21] So she got that
[1:17:23] 80 and then God told her I want to give
[1:17:27] this to a
[1:17:30] missionary. So God
[1:17:33] himself after some
[1:17:36] time guided
[1:17:38] her. There was a missionary
[1:17:43] brother. He she didn't know
[1:17:45] him. But he was praying. Lord, there is
[1:17:48] this burden to go
[1:17:50] here. But then there is this need. He
[1:17:53] kept on praying. So now what happened?
[1:17:57] This man moved out to go to the
[1:17:59] street. And now this sister also moved
[1:18:02] out to go to the
[1:18:03] street. And then God told the sister
[1:18:07] that's the man. She got the
[1:18:10] £80. This man was the need was
[1:18:15] £80. They didn't know one another. But
[1:18:17] how God moved this
[1:18:19] sister to reach this brother and she
[1:18:22] gave him God to give you
[1:18:25] 80. And he just started
[1:18:28] crying.
[1:18:30] Of course, now the sister had enough to
[1:18:34] give whatever she
[1:18:37] had. But then if for you are paying to
[1:18:40] pay 10,000
[1:18:44] 10%. How will God move you to do
[1:18:48] that? Because you feel like you know
[1:18:51] this is too
[1:18:53] much. So now we need to see that we
[1:18:57] bring supplies in the
[1:19:01] storehouse. He says give according to
[1:19:04] the ability God has given
[1:19:08] you. Because he's telling you I need 10%
[1:19:11] of what I've
[1:19:12] given. I need also offerings.
[1:19:15] He says, "Bring in the
[1:19:19] storehouse that my house doesn't
[1:19:23] lack." Praise the name of our God. And
[1:19:26] this is our
[1:19:28] obligation. Praise the name of our Lord
[1:19:30] because the Bible
[1:19:32] says, the one who gives you the
[1:19:35] spiritual
[1:19:36] things, you give them the physical
[1:19:38] things.
[1:19:41] Don't look at saying
[1:19:44] ah but they are doing better than
[1:19:47] me. No don't look at that. Look at the
[1:19:50] command of
[1:19:52] God. Praise the name of our Lord and
[1:19:54] that's how God will bless
[1:19:56] you. Don't
[1:19:58] say but this is even too little. I can't
[1:20:01] give
[1:20:02] it. Don't look at that. Look at
[1:20:05] fulfilling the word of God.
[1:20:09] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:20:11] there is a there is a a testimony
[1:20:13] brother Brham was
[1:20:15] giving and then the brother felt in his
[1:20:19] heart and he got
[1:20:22] $10 and gave to a certain brother was
[1:20:24] head of the
[1:20:26] missionary my brother give this to
[1:20:29] brother
[1:20:31] Brham because that was in their heart to
[1:20:34] give and then the brother got the $10.
[1:20:40] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:20:42] learn how to bring what is due for the
[1:20:49] storehouse and don't despise the little
[1:20:51] you are
[1:20:52] getting but from that little you are
[1:20:56] getting faithful before
[1:21:00] God now I'll be eating into my capital.
[1:21:04] And now that one I'll be going into my
[1:21:11] capital. Praise the name of the Lord. We
[1:21:14] need to be faithful.
[1:21:17] We want God to bless
[1:21:19] us. And each of us there is something we
[1:21:22] are doing for a
[1:21:24] living. So from what you're doing for a
[1:21:27] living what the Lord has blessed you
[1:21:31] with it says don't appear before me
[1:21:36] empty-handed give me bring your
[1:21:40] tithes offering if I'm getting maybe
[1:21:44] 100,000 a
[1:21:47] week let me bring my tithe of
[1:21:50] 10,000 and let me also bring my
[1:21:53] offering praise the name
[1:21:55] And you know this life is so
[1:21:58] funny that the
[1:22:00] needs will never be will never get
[1:22:03] over the needs will always be
[1:22:08] there. Right now the need may be
[1:22:11] this but after sometime when that is
[1:22:14] over there's another one that
[1:22:16] comes the need will always be
[1:22:20] there but God gives
[1:22:23] opportunities to
[1:22:25] supply now he's saying from the
[1:22:27] opportunities I've given
[1:22:29] you support the work of the
[1:22:32] kingdom praise the name of our Lord and
[1:22:35] you know
[1:22:37] God does not ask
[1:22:40] you what he has not given you.
[1:22:44] Let us look at that example here.
[1:22:47] Let us go to Exodus
[1:22:52] 3:21. Exodus 3.
[1:22:57] And then verse 21,
[1:23:00] he says, "And I'll give these people
[1:23:02] favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and
[1:23:05] it shall come to pass that when you go,
[1:23:08] you shall not go empty. But every woman
[1:23:12] shall borrow of her neighbor and of her
[1:23:15] that sojourneth in her house jewels of
[1:23:18] silver and jewels of gold and raignment.
[1:23:21] And you shall put them upon your sons
[1:23:24] and upon your daughters and you you
[1:23:26] shall spoil Egyptians.
[1:24:03] Now God was telling the children of
[1:24:06] Israel. I'm taking you out of
[1:24:09] Egypt, but I'm not taking you
[1:24:14] emptyhanded. You are going to spoil the
[1:24:19] Egyptians. And then how did they spoil
[1:24:22] them? He said, "Go and
[1:24:26] borrow." God has given a
[1:24:29] command. Go and
[1:24:31] borrow. The Bible says,
[1:24:34] Praise the name of our Lord. A man that
[1:24:36] does not provide for his
[1:24:39] house is worse than an
[1:24:47] infidel. So the command is go and
[1:24:51] work. Go and dress the
[1:24:54] garden. He has given you the soil. He
[1:24:57] has given you the life, the body. Dress
[1:25:00] the garden. go and work and don't
[1:25:04] despise any
[1:25:07] work for me. I'm so educated.
[1:25:10] I can't do this job.
[1:25:14] Go and start from
[1:25:16] there. Praise the name of you know
[1:25:19] sometimes when you finish
[1:25:21] school you think you know too much but
[1:25:24] even that person who never went to
[1:25:26] school that work
[1:25:29] knows better than you.
[1:25:32] So you humble yourself under those
[1:25:34] people and you learn from
[1:25:38] them. Praise the name of just have a
[1:25:41] right
[1:25:42] attitude. Start from
[1:25:45] somewhere and you know jobs. You're not
[1:25:48] going to it's not easy for you to get a
[1:25:50] job when you're just at
[1:25:52] home. But go in the field.
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:01] Praise the name of the Lord. Like maybe
[1:26:03] you go in the
[1:26:05] morning where they recruiting
[1:26:08] people. You know in the
[1:26:11] Bible there is a place
[1:26:14] in they call it jobless corner.
[1:26:26] If somebody want somebody to leave for
[1:26:28] them
[1:26:35] things go also where they look for
[1:26:39] jobs go to those places
[1:26:43] like a lot of
[1:26:47] work doesn't support me to go but the
[1:26:50] degree is not giving anything
[1:26:52] Now go and
[1:26:54] work. Start from
[1:26:56] somewhere so that you can
[1:26:59] provide so that you can
[1:27:02] earn. You know you have you have the
[1:27:14] body but you wake up and eat food all
[1:27:17] day.
[1:27:19] Where do you get the food you
[1:27:21] eat? Go and
[1:27:23] work. Go and look for some work to
[1:27:27] do. That's the principle
[1:27:29] here. And say, Lord, I'm going
[1:27:32] out. Be like
[1:27:34] Ruth. She's a stranger in the land. They
[1:27:38] don't have food. Then, Lord, I'm going
[1:27:42] out. And then she goes to a field where
[1:27:44] people are doing some
[1:27:46] work. And then sir, what can you do? We
[1:27:50] started doing
[1:27:51] something. Then at the end of the day,
[1:27:54] he gave us
[1:27:55] something. He took home. That's the same
[1:27:58] thing with
[1:27:59] us. Go out.
[1:28:03] And when you are going to look for a
[1:28:07] job, you don't work at 9
[1:28:12] a.m. You'll be there even at
[1:28:17] 6. But you say my
[1:28:22] degree. You know there are people who
[1:28:24] know how to get
[1:28:27] jobs. They can say okay the boss drives
[1:28:31] that car.
[1:28:32] Okay. Okay. So they scheme they go early
[1:28:35] in the morning at that at that
[1:28:37] door of course may not allow
[1:28:40] you and then you see the boss is coming
[1:28:44] you stand
[1:28:45] up. Why is this man standing up? If the
[1:28:50] is delaying then you run as if you're
[1:28:52] going to open the
[1:28:55] gate. But now if you just seated
[1:28:59] there they have not given me a job.
[1:29:01] They're not going to consider
[1:29:04] you. But you know, you need to see that
[1:29:06] you do
[1:29:09] something. Like now, for example, if
[1:29:11] you've gone to the
[1:29:12] garage, maybe brother's
[1:29:16] garage, you've come with your
[1:29:19] certificate. You know what they tell
[1:29:21] you? You pay for
[1:29:23] training because you don't know what
[1:29:25] you're going to do. Why does have the
[1:29:27] paper? But now if you reach in the
[1:29:33] garage
[1:29:37] now you're not
[1:29:40] serious but now you're going
[1:29:42] there. You want to convince those people
[1:29:46] show that you are better than
[1:29:49] others. Maybe the the mechanic has gone
[1:29:52] below the
[1:29:53] car and then you see the spanner is far.
[1:29:58] You go around asking can I bring you the
[1:29:59] other
[1:30:01] span even if they have not given you
[1:30:04] work you are showing
[1:30:07] willingness not sitting
[1:30:10] there they have not told me to bring any
[1:30:13] span you're not going to get
[1:30:15] anything but be interested in the
[1:30:20] work praise the name of you know like
[1:30:23] children at
[1:30:25] home naturally
[1:30:27] either their parents or the people they
[1:30:29] live with not allow them to drive their
[1:30:33] car but the child will do one
[1:30:37] thing your car is very
[1:30:39] dirty okay what can you do okay you pack
[1:30:43] it there I I wash it for
[1:30:46] you you're making ends meet then you
[1:30:50] start
[1:30:52] washing when you finish I finished
[1:30:56] You're building a
[1:30:58] relationship. It will not be too long. I
[1:31:00] think you come and share to drive in
[1:31:02] case I'm not around. You turn it
[1:31:05] like if you're going to be in the
[1:31:07] sitting room and you want your father to
[1:31:08] give you a car to drive or your
[1:31:13] mother, you have to show
[1:31:16] something. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:31:19] If you're a girl at
[1:31:21] home, all the time you're in the sitting
[1:31:23] room or your bedroom,
[1:31:26] When you are hungry,
[1:31:32] you is
[1:31:34] ready. Have you cooked it or not? But
[1:31:38] show
[1:31:39] interest
[1:31:42] going what is
[1:31:45] lacking then you can tell them that I'm
[1:31:50] hungry. That's how you get jobs.
[1:31:54] Not being awake and waiting for a call.
[1:31:56] The boss to call me the
[1:31:58] night. You may never receive that
[1:32:00] call. Go where the work
[1:32:03] is and show
[1:32:07] interest. Praise the name of the Lord
[1:32:10] like
[1:32:16] equipment for me. I want to learn but no
[1:32:18] one calls me. How will they come and
[1:32:20] call you?
[1:32:24] That's the one thing about jobs
[1:32:27] nowadays. Most of the work they the
[1:32:30] people don't
[1:32:33] apply but they sh this one can do this
[1:32:36] one or you can even start from
[1:32:39] down then they see your
[1:32:42] ability your
[1:32:44] faithfulness I think you can do this I
[1:32:46] think you can do this. That's how some
[1:32:49] people have grown through.
[1:32:51] So you need to see that you look for
[1:32:55] work. Go where the work is
[1:32:59] given. If they open at
[1:33:01] 6 before
[1:33:05] 6, one of the workers may fail to come
[1:33:07] that
[1:33:10] day and we lacking somebody. This young
[1:33:13] man has been here since morning. you
[1:33:16] come and we see what you find and you
[1:33:18] get the work not sitting at home you
[1:33:21] know I went to that place asking them
[1:33:23] for
[1:33:27] work they don't begin
[1:33:30] at they start in the morning so you
[1:33:33] don't just sit back
[1:33:35] home I finished my course two years
[1:33:39] ago I have no job go and look for
[1:33:43] work and when God gives you the work.
[1:33:47] You've got some
[1:33:49] money. Now, this is another
[1:33:53] area. You know, with my
[1:33:55] degree and my diploma, that money is too
[1:34:00] small and he sits at home and then you
[1:34:04] forget what you
[1:34:06] learned. At the end of the day, you go
[1:34:07] for the
[1:34:09] interview. They ask you, "What is in
[1:34:13] your mind is Tik Tok.
[1:34:16] Facebook
[1:34:19] Facebook very
[1:34:22] strange there is somebody who was
[1:34:24] telling
[1:34:26] me that there is a a radio station and
[1:34:29] television being opened up in western
[1:34:33] Uganda and then for him he was put on
[1:34:35] the panel
[1:34:40] which interviews people
[1:34:44] So they got 200
[1:34:48] applications, news
[1:34:50] anchors, these ones who collect
[1:34:53] news, different categories of
[1:34:56] people in the media
[1:34:59] industry. And now for him when he was
[1:35:01] seated on that
[1:35:04] panel, he saw a name of a person he
[1:35:07] studied
[1:35:08] with. Then he told his colleagues on the
[1:35:12] panel
[1:35:14] to me is a conflict of
[1:35:19] interest. I can't do anything. I'm not
[1:35:22] going to ask any
[1:35:25] question. You are going to ask because
[1:35:27] this one is my OG.
[1:35:32] Now, can you
[1:35:35] imagine you're looking for a job to be a
[1:35:40] journalist and then you go to where
[1:35:42] they're employing
[1:35:45] journalists and now they asked basic
[1:35:51] questions. One asked her, "Where do you
[1:35:55] come from?" Then she said the place she
[1:35:57] comes from.
[1:35:59] Then they asked her, "Who is your area
[1:36:02] member of parliament?"
[1:36:14] Nothing. You a
[1:36:16] journalist. You even don't know the MP
[1:36:18] of your
[1:36:21] area. What kind of journalism are you
[1:36:23] doing
[1:36:25] really? If you don't know the local
[1:36:27] leaders,
[1:36:29] Then they ask again another
[1:36:32] question that
[1:36:35] now on the diplomatic issues concerning
[1:36:43] Uganda. What is going on now?
[1:36:49] You know those were the times you know
[1:36:51] there was issues between German and
[1:36:53] Uganda and then
[1:36:56] what a lot of things going
[1:36:58] around and she just didn't
[1:37:02] know
[1:37:05] journalist but doesn't know what's
[1:37:08] happening I will start to work when they
[1:37:10] give me the job she wasn't given the
[1:37:15] job yet she had favor
[1:37:19] The questions were
[1:37:23] basic. She doesn't know what to
[1:37:26] do. Somebody going to to to ask a job of
[1:37:31] health
[1:37:36] worker. Then they ask you a basic
[1:37:41] question. What disease kills most the
[1:37:43] people in Uganda?
[1:37:50] What kind of health work are
[1:37:53] you? Who even doesn't know what's
[1:37:56] happening on
[1:38:00] ground? Now some people are not prepared
[1:38:02] for getting
[1:38:06] jobs like I'm going to go get a job
[1:38:08] maybe in the se of brother
[1:38:14] Cyrus information technology ICT
[1:38:19] IC then they ask
[1:38:25] you how what do you know about
[1:38:28] artificial intelligence?
[1:38:30] Then you start wondering what is
[1:38:31] artificial intelligence? What are you
[1:38:32] talking
[1:38:36] about? You're not ready for the
[1:38:39] job. So when you are looking for a
[1:38:42] job, see that you are
[1:38:45] ready, not the things around
[1:38:49] it. And then you get the
[1:38:52] job. Here God told the children of
[1:38:55] Israel, go to your
[1:38:58] neighbors. So it was to the children of
[1:39:01] Israel to go to the
[1:39:03] neighbors, not the neighbors to come to
[1:39:06] them. But they had to go
[1:39:09] there. Same thing with work. Go where
[1:39:12] the work
[1:39:14] is. Say, Lord, let me find favor before
[1:39:16] this
[1:39:17] person. Yesterday I came, I didn't get
[1:39:21] let me find favor. and you keep on going
[1:39:25] because you have
[1:39:27] expectations and the Lord opens door for
[1:39:29] you and you start working. So if these
[1:39:33] children of
[1:39:34] Israel didn't go to the
[1:39:38] Egyptians and ask for them of things,
[1:39:41] how would they have got
[1:39:43] them? But they went and
[1:39:45] asked, praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:39:48] we can continue with that
[1:39:49] story in Exodus
[1:39:55] 12:35. The Bible says, "And the children
[1:39:58] of Israel did according to the word of
[1:40:01] Moses, and they borrowed of the
[1:40:03] Egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of
[1:40:07] gold and raignment. And the Lord gave
[1:40:11] the people favor in the sight of the
[1:40:14] Egyptians, so that they lent unto them
[1:40:17] such things as they required, and they
[1:40:20] spoiled the Egyptians.
[1:40:40] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[1:40:42] says they did as God told
[1:40:47] them. Lord, I've come out in the
[1:40:51] field. Lord, help me to find favor
[1:40:53] before the
[1:40:55] bosses. You're looking for a
[1:40:57] job. And then say, I'm ready.
[1:41:01] And I can give you a simple
[1:41:03] test. Ah, you can do
[1:41:06] this. Okay. You can buy for me
[1:41:13] water for me. I have not come yet for
[1:41:16] you
[1:41:18] water. You have
[1:41:22] lost. Nobody will give me say if now
[1:41:25] that thing is hard for him to do
[1:41:31] you lose the job. But the Bible says
[1:41:34] they did as God told
[1:41:37] them. And now when they ask the
[1:41:41] Egyptians, your role is look for a
[1:41:45] job to open up. It's the Lord. Then the
[1:41:50] Bible says, "Then God made the
[1:41:54] Egyptians to favor the
[1:41:57] Israelites until the Egyptians started
[1:42:00] giving out their
[1:42:01] things and then giving the
[1:42:04] Israelites and then the Israelites
[1:42:06] carried them and then the Bible says
[1:42:10] Israel spoiled
[1:42:13] Egypt. They carried with them
[1:42:16] things. But how would they get them? By
[1:42:20] following what the Lord
[1:42:22] told. The same thing with us. God has
[1:42:25] given you the hands. God has given you
[1:42:28] good
[1:42:29] health and
[1:42:30] work. And when God blesses you
[1:42:34] with because it is God who gives you the
[1:42:39] strength. That's what the Bible says.
[1:42:41] You can pick that scripture
[1:42:44] here. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:42:47] us go to the book of
[1:42:51] Deuteronomy.
[1:42:54] Deuteronomy
[1:43:01] 8 and then verse 10.
[1:43:05] He says,
[1:43:10] "When thou hast eaten and are full, then
[1:43:14] thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for
[1:43:16] the good land which he has given thee.
[1:43:28] Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy
[1:43:30] God in not keeping his commandments and
[1:43:34] his judgments and his statutes which I
[1:43:36] command thee this day.
[1:43:51] Lest when thou hast eaten and full and
[1:43:55] hast built goodly houses and dwelt there
[1:44:09] in thy hearts and thy flocks multiply
[1:44:13] and thy silver and thy gold is multiply.
[1:44:16] And all that thou hast is multiplied.
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:33] Then thine heart be lifted up, and th
[1:44:36] forget the Lord thy God, which brought
[1:44:38] thee out of the land of Egypt, from the
[1:44:41] house of
[1:44:47] [Music]
[1:44:50] bondage. How do you forget
[1:44:53] God? Not keeping his word. So he says,
[1:44:56] "Return unto me.
[1:44:59] do what I'm telling you to
[1:45:01] do. Then in verse
[1:45:04] 17, and those say in thine
[1:45:08] heart, my power and might of mine hand
[1:45:11] has gotten me this well.
[1:45:19] But thou shalt remember the Lord thy
[1:45:24] God. For it is he that giveth thee power
[1:45:27] to get
[1:45:31] wealth, that he may establish his
[1:45:34] covenant, which he saw unto thy fathers
[1:45:36] as this
[1:45:42] day. Praise the name of Lord. He says it
[1:45:44] is God that gives us the opportunities
[1:45:49] He gives you the
[1:45:50] life. You are
[1:45:53] healthy. He gives you the strength. You
[1:45:57] are strong. He gives you the wisdom.
[1:46:00] When they ask you this question, you
[1:46:03] were to answer back and is the one again
[1:46:07] who gives you
[1:46:08] favor before those people. Then they
[1:46:11] say, "Okay, you take over this." Because
[1:46:14] the Bible says promotion neither comes
[1:46:16] from the east or
[1:46:19] west, but it's the Lord who sets up one
[1:46:23] one and he puts another down. Now that
[1:46:27] you have found favor before
[1:46:30] God's given you good
[1:46:33] health. He's watching over you.
[1:46:36] You know there are people who struggle
[1:46:38] for
[1:46:39] things but the time they get the
[1:46:42] thing the life goes
[1:46:45] away like I was looking at a very a very
[1:46:49] unfortunate
[1:46:52] situation. You know when we had here a
[1:46:55] deputy
[1:46:57] speaker struggled many years to become a
[1:47:00] speaker and now he is a
[1:47:03] speaker even when the life is not
[1:47:07] there but it is God who gives you those
[1:47:11] abilities. He has put you in this
[1:47:14] position and he protects you while
[1:47:16] you're in that position.
[1:47:19] So we need to
[1:47:20] recognize what the Lord does in our
[1:47:24] lives. God is the one who gives you the
[1:47:26] protection at your place of
[1:47:28] work. Others get
[1:47:31] accidents and they can't
[1:47:34] recover. Others travel to work. They get
[1:47:38] accident when they going to
[1:47:40] work or others. Anything can happen. But
[1:47:45] then he's saying it is God who has given
[1:47:47] you these things.
[1:47:49] He has given you good health. He has
[1:47:52] given you the
[1:47:54] talent, the
[1:47:56] skills to know these things that for you
[1:48:00] there is the way you handle
[1:48:01] things which is better than others. And
[1:48:05] sometimes they are more educated than
[1:48:07] you. But for you there is a way God has
[1:48:10] given you to
[1:48:12] understand better than the
[1:48:14] others or you are preferred above the
[1:48:17] others.
[1:48:20] It is God opening all those
[1:48:22] doors. So he says, "Don't say my
[1:48:25] power, my knowledge, my understanding
[1:48:30] has given me all these
[1:48:31] things. Don't be like
[1:48:34] Nebuchadnezzar. Praise the name of our
[1:48:36] Lord. But remember the Lord in keeping
[1:48:39] his
[1:48:40] commandments. Praise the name of our
[1:48:42] Lord." So he say it is God that gives us
[1:48:44] the ability
[1:48:48] You know it's not our
[1:48:50] ability but who gives the
[1:48:53] opportunity even your current place of
[1:48:57] work regardless of how much you are
[1:49:00] given regardless what position you are
[1:49:03] having is still the favor of
[1:49:06] God. Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[1:49:09] need to see that you do what the Lord
[1:49:11] requires you to
[1:49:13] do. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:49:16] when the Egyptians had got a lot rather
[1:49:19] the is the Israelites had got a
[1:49:22] lot like yourself you've
[1:49:26] earned they have given you a
[1:49:29] salary you've planted you have
[1:49:33] harvested you've been you've been
[1:49:36] rearing
[1:49:37] animals they
[1:49:42] supply now God says from what I've given
[1:49:45] given you. Now I need a
[1:49:48] tithe. I need an
[1:49:50] offering. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:49:53] Now let us go to Exodus chapter
[1:49:56] 25 and then read verse
[1:50:01] one. You know God had given them a
[1:50:05] lot and now God is telling
[1:50:09] them bring me an offering.
[1:50:13] He doesn't ask you what you don't
[1:50:16] have. He first gives you says, "Give
[1:50:20] me." And when he's asking you, he's not
[1:50:23] asking all you
[1:50:24] have. See how it says it here? Exodus
[1:50:30] 25:1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses,
[1:50:33] saying, "Speak unto the children of
[1:50:37] Israel that they bring me an offering.
[1:50:43] of every man that
[1:50:47] giveth that giveth it willingly with his
[1:50:51] heart, you shall take my
[1:50:59] offering. He has given them from in
[1:51:03] Egypt. They are now in the wilderness.
[1:51:06] And he says, "Give me."
[1:51:09] But says with a willing
[1:51:16] heart, he told us we have to
[1:51:19] give. They don't know the situation I'm
[1:51:21] going through. Have a willing
[1:51:24] heart. This is the word of the
[1:51:26] Lord. Praise the name of the Lord. It's
[1:51:29] the word of the Lord. You do it as
[1:51:32] you're doing it to the Lord.
[1:51:35] Say Lord what you've given unto me I'm
[1:51:39] giving back.
[1:51:42] Praise the name of don't start
[1:51:53] afterulating. That's the devil
[1:51:56] now. But okay the question is from the
[1:51:59] time you started
[1:52:01] giving how much have you benefited?
[1:52:05] You have not fallen
[1:52:06] sick, but others fall
[1:52:10] sick. You've been
[1:52:12] protected. Your job is still there.
[1:52:15] Maybe you have even been given a
[1:52:17] promotion. Your children are not
[1:52:21] problematic. Your family is not torn
[1:52:23] apart.
[1:52:26] There are people who earn a lot of
[1:52:29] money but they have no
[1:52:32] peace and they look for peace and it's
[1:52:34] not there. But for you God has given you
[1:52:37] peace. He has given you favor. Thief
[1:52:41] don't disturb
[1:52:43] you. When at night you sleep
[1:52:48] soundly but
[1:52:51] others and you can't pay God for all
[1:52:54] those things.
[1:52:56] Praise the name of the Lord. So he says
[1:52:58] they should offer
[1:53:02] willingly in verse three. And this is
[1:53:05] the offering which you shall take of
[1:53:12] them. Gold, silver, brass, blue and
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:23] purple, scarlet and fine linen
[1:53:27] and God's
[1:53:30] hair and Rama's skin dyed red.
[1:53:35] and badger
[1:53:36] skins and wood.
[1:53:46] Then
[1:53:48] wood five. And then oil for delight.
[1:53:52] Verse
[1:53:54] six. Spices for anointing
[1:53:59] oil and for sweet incense.
[1:54:07] stones and stones to set in off and a
[1:54:11] blessed
[1:54:16] plate and let them make me a
[1:54:20] sanctuary that I may dwell among them.
[1:54:26] Now he's given them and he's asking give
[1:54:29] me
[1:54:30] your and each person had a different
[1:54:33] thing. There are those who had
[1:54:36] gold to give of gold. Those who had
[1:54:40] silver of silver
[1:54:42] they had
[1:54:44] animals and now maybe say okay God wants
[1:54:47] go
[1:54:49] skin. Okay I want to give. So you
[1:54:52] slaughter your goat. Maybe you sell your
[1:54:55] meat or you do
[1:54:56] what you get the skin well you
[1:55:00] give. Then there are those who had
[1:55:03] stones. Oh, I have this stone here. Let
[1:55:06] me give there are those who had
[1:55:10] spices you know they like that I'm also
[1:55:14] giving. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:55:17] then in verse in chapter
[1:55:22] 35 and then verse and verse 5,
[1:55:26] then Moses spoke unto all the
[1:55:27] congregation of Israel, saying, "This is
[1:55:30] the thing that the Lord has commanded,
[1:55:32] saying, Take ye from among you an
[1:55:35] offering unto L unto the Lord. Whosoever
[1:55:38] is of a willing heart, let him bring it
[1:55:41] an offering of the Lord, gold, silver,
[1:55:44] and brass.
[1:56:14] Verse 20.
[1:56:17] And all the congregation of the children
[1:56:18] of Israel departed from the presence of
[1:56:22] Moses.
[1:56:27] And they came everyone whose heart was
[1:56:30] steered in
[1:56:35] him and everyone whose spirit made
[1:56:41] willing and they brought the Lord's
[1:56:44] offering to work of the tabernacle of
[1:56:46] the congregation and of all the service
[1:56:49] and for the holy garments.
[1:56:56] [Music]
[1:57:07] The Bible says those who were
[1:57:10] willing, they went back. I have this put
[1:57:15] the use of the kingdom. Have this put in
[1:57:17] the use of the kingdom. gave an
[1:57:21] offering
[1:57:23] willingly in verse 29. The children of
[1:57:27] Israel brought a willing offering unto
[1:57:30] the
[1:57:35] Lord. Every man and
[1:57:39] woman whose heart made them willing to
[1:57:42] bring all manner of work.
[1:57:51] which the Lord had commanded to be made
[1:57:53] by the hand of
[1:57:57] Moses. This is how we need to do also in
[1:58:00] the name of we need to bring what God
[1:58:03] has given
[1:58:05] us. Supply the
[1:58:07] storehouse with a willing
[1:58:10] heart. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:58:13] many times we are always running here in
[1:58:19] debt as a
[1:58:21] church every time we have a
[1:58:24] service there are expenses that are
[1:58:28] made. So we need to see that we
[1:58:32] supply in the
[1:58:34] storehouse that our brothers who are
[1:58:37] treasurers and trustes are not burdened.
[1:58:41] [Music]
[1:58:44] Because they most times pick from their
[1:58:49] pocket. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:58:51] Many times they pick from their
[1:58:54] pocket to support the needs
[1:58:57] here. Praise the name of the Lord. So we
[1:59:00] need to see that we
[1:59:03] supply every time we come here. There
[1:59:07] are expenses we make.
[1:59:10] We need to get the detergents for
[1:59:14] cleaning, brushes and
[1:59:16] everything. We need to supply the
[1:59:18] toiletries
[1:59:21] there. We need to get issues of data or
[1:59:24] air
[1:59:29] time. Every Sunday and Wednesday we are
[1:59:31] live
[1:59:33] streaming. It's
[1:59:35] money. Power is money.
[1:59:39] If the power is off, we have the
[1:59:40] generator. It's
[1:59:42] money. Water we have to
[1:59:46] pay. Flashing the compound, we have to
[1:59:50] pay. But where does that money come
[1:59:52] from? It should be able to come from
[1:59:56] us. As God has blessed me, let me bring
[2:00:00] into the
[2:00:02] storehouse. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:00:04] Like you look at our
[2:00:06] church, it needs
[2:00:09] renovation four, five years ago. We need
[2:00:12] to do another
[2:00:16] painting. We need to improve our
[2:00:19] toiletries. We need to improve our
[2:00:22] security. Our public system, we need to
[2:00:25] see that they
[2:00:27] improve. But where will the money come
[2:00:30] from? If we the
[2:00:34] beneficiaries, we are not willing to
[2:00:37] give. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[2:00:40] don't despise what you
[2:00:43] have. Bring what the Lord has put upon
[2:00:46] your
[2:00:47] heart. I said, "Look me, I have this. I
[2:00:50] can bring it
[2:00:52] here." Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:00:54] There are many things that are needed
[2:00:57] here. So, let us supply the storehouse.
[2:01:02] Now and when you are
[2:01:04] bringing don't tell and don't put
[2:01:07] another burden to another
[2:01:12] person I think it is the other
[2:01:16] me once there is a need there is a
[2:01:21] provision praise the name of our lord
[2:01:23] I'm told I think it was brother Hilda
[2:01:25] branch
[2:01:28] it was brother Hilda branch
[2:01:31] And then he was always in
[2:01:33] meetings and then he said
[2:01:37] now we have opportunity to be
[2:01:41] blessed. Now that's what I was
[2:01:44] saying. I said we have
[2:01:46] money. Then he said, "But the problem is
[2:01:50] in your
[2:01:52] pocket now. The willingness remove it
[2:01:55] from your
[2:01:58] pocket and bring in the
[2:02:02] treasure."
[2:02:04] Willingness, but we need to come out and
[2:02:07] do these things.
[2:02:09] I was getting a testimony from a certain
[2:02:13] brother and then he was saying they just
[2:02:17] have only 10 members in the
[2:02:20] church. 10 members
[2:02:23] only. They had a need of a
[2:02:28] projector and projector disturbs us a
[2:02:31] lot.
[2:02:33] I think said about 10 years
[2:02:37] old could be more than 10 years or even
[2:02:40] 20 I can't
[2:02:42] tell but now there are 10 members in a
[2:02:45] church they had the need of a
[2:02:48] projector and to buy one from they
[2:02:51] needed one and a half million
[2:02:55] shillings
[2:02:58] about.5 so
[2:03:02] So he was sharing with me what do we
[2:03:05] do? Said but you tell your people to do
[2:03:09] that. He got the
[2:03:11] boldness. You know boldness is also a
[2:03:13] challenge.
[2:03:16] Praise the name
[2:03:17] of But God opened the hearts of those
[2:03:22] people to raise one and a half million
[2:03:26] shillings within one month and they
[2:03:29] bought a
[2:03:30] project 10 people. How about us
[2:03:34] now? When we have a
[2:03:37] need and these things are for the
[2:03:41] kingdom like we have a need which is
[2:03:43] urgent.
[2:03:46] We need a gaming laptop,
[2:03:51] you know, which has better graphics and
[2:03:54] everything such that it can bring out
[2:03:57] streaming. So
[2:04:00] well, it's 5
[2:04:04] millions. Who can do
[2:04:07] that? Now let us not look at the people
[2:04:11] outside ourselves.
[2:04:15] Praise the name of our Lord. We
[2:04:18] ourselves. It's a burden we need to
[2:04:22] carry and said this thing is serving the
[2:04:25] kingdom of
[2:04:27] God. Why don't I put into the
[2:04:30] kingdom because it's a
[2:04:33] need. Praise the name of Lord. It's a
[2:04:35] need that we
[2:04:36] have. We need to see that we pull up and
[2:04:39] supply that need.
[2:04:43] So God told
[2:04:45] Moses, "All those who are
[2:04:49] willing and indeed there are people who
[2:04:51] are
[2:04:53] willing
[2:04:55] act. You go forward and do
[2:04:59] it. Praise the name of our Lord. You go
[2:05:02] forward and do
[2:05:03] it. There is a church I was also told
[2:05:07] about.
[2:05:10] They are fewer than
[2:05:12] us. They had a need of a gaming
[2:05:17] laptop. And then I'm
[2:05:20] told they said, "Ah, this is a
[2:05:23] problem. Let us handle it."
[2:05:29] So that day whatever midweek
[2:05:33] service they all
[2:05:36] pledged within I think two
[2:05:39] weeks also they will raise that money to
[2:05:42] buy that
[2:05:45] game. How about
[2:05:47] ush you know I earn
[2:05:50] little and where do you put
[2:05:53] it? How about the kingdom of God?
[2:05:58] Praise the name of the Lord about the
[2:06:00] kingdom of
[2:06:03] God. We have like it's good we have
[2:06:06] brother Moa there
[2:06:09] behind they contribute
[2:06:12] money to buy their land on the
[2:06:16] island. Then he calls you now we have
[2:06:20] reached this far now we want to buy some
[2:06:24] materials. when they contribute and buy
[2:06:26] and
[2:06:29] build. Unfortunately, the other time
[2:06:31] when they did the
[2:06:33] construction, when the storms came, they
[2:06:36] did damage, a lot of damage to
[2:06:40] their now even their
[2:06:44] businesses. They can't do the
[2:06:46] businesses because of
[2:06:51] restrictions. Now, how about us?
[2:06:55] Praise the name of our Lord. The Lord
[2:06:58] has been so gracious to
[2:07:00] us. We need to supply to meet the needs
[2:07:03] that we
[2:07:05] have. Praise the name of our Lord. Be
[2:07:08] willing. Don't look at another
[2:07:11] person. I think the other brother earns
[2:07:13] more money. That one will be able to
[2:07:15] manage
[2:07:17] that. Don't budget from another person's
[2:07:21] pocket. From your pocket.
[2:07:24] What am I willing to
[2:07:26] bring? Let us supply the store
[2:07:30] house. Praise the name of the Lord. Now
[2:07:33] in Exodus 36 and then verse
[2:07:39] 2 it says
[2:07:43] and Moses called Bazel and Aia and every
[2:07:46] wisearted man in whose heart the Lord
[2:07:49] had put wisdom everyone whose heart
[2:07:52] steered him up to come up unto the work
[2:07:55] to do it.
[2:08:17] And they received of Moses all the
[2:08:20] offering which the children of Israel
[2:08:22] had brought for the work of the service
[2:08:24] of the sanctuary to make it wither. And
[2:08:27] they brought yet unto him free offerings
[2:08:30] every morning.
[2:08:53] And all the wise men that wrought all
[2:08:56] the work of the sanctuary came every man
[2:08:59] from his work which they had made.
[2:09:15] And they spoke unto Moses, saying, "The
[2:09:17] people bring much more than enough for
[2:09:20] the service of the work which the Lord
[2:09:23] commanded to make."
[2:09:36] And Moses gave commandment, and they
[2:09:38] caused it to be proclaimed throughout
[2:09:40] the camp, saying, "Let neither man nor a
[2:09:44] woman make any more work for the
[2:09:46] offering of the sanctuary." So the
[2:09:48] people were restrained from bringing
[2:10:10] For the stuff they had was sufficient
[2:10:12] for all the work to make it and too
[2:10:16] much.
[2:10:25] Praise the name of the Lord. He says it
[2:10:27] was
[2:10:28] much they had supplied in the
[2:10:33] storehouse more than enough. And that's
[2:10:36] what the Lord is telling us that if we
[2:10:38] can pay our tithes and
[2:10:41] offerings, the windows of heaven will
[2:10:44] open upon our
[2:10:46] house. A lot
[2:10:49] Praise the name of And this is our
[2:10:53] desire. You know, Lord, I want you to
[2:10:55] make my house better than it
[2:10:58] is. You know, like when
[2:11:01] Portifer when he appointed
[2:11:04] Joseph to be the head of his
[2:11:07] house, brought the blessings of
[2:11:10] God in the house of
[2:11:12] Portifer. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:11:15] It's the same thing also here.
[2:11:18] Praise the name of our Lord. We can be
[2:11:20] obedient to the word of
[2:11:22] God, doing what the Lord is telling us.
[2:11:26] And then the Lord will appoint a
[2:11:27] blessing upon our
[2:11:29] heart to give whatever we
[2:11:33] need. You not stress about this. You not
[2:11:37] stress about
[2:11:38] this because God has taken care of it.
[2:11:43] Let us not put these things to the
[2:11:45] past, but let us bring them to our
[2:11:48] present
[2:11:50] day. And when there is a need, there's
[2:11:53] an opportunity for you to be
[2:11:55] blessed because the Bible says, it is
[2:11:58] more blessed to
[2:12:00] give than to
[2:12:02] receive. But you
[2:12:05] imagine you are very
[2:12:07] hungry and somebody gives you food to
[2:12:10] eat.
[2:12:13] You can even start and eat it in one
[2:12:20] minute. Thank
[2:12:22] you. These people are so good. Even when
[2:12:25] you know somebody is bad, you say they
[2:12:26] are good because they have given you
[2:12:31] food. God has left me. Now you see the
[2:12:35] joy you have when you
[2:12:37] receive. But the Bible say is more
[2:12:40] blessed to give.
[2:12:43] You imagine when you are
[2:12:45] receiving the Bible says the one who
[2:12:48] gives you has more blessing but many
[2:12:52] times you just want to
[2:12:55] receive give me give me give me how are
[2:12:59] you going to give also when are you
[2:13:01] going to give also and this is what the
[2:13:04] Lord is asking from
[2:13:05] us the little I have given you give
[2:13:09] me and you not before God it is little
[2:13:14] to it may be
[2:13:16] much but to God it's
[2:13:19] little like the one who was given five
[2:13:22] talents he says you have been faithful
[2:13:24] in these little
[2:13:27] things now the one who was given one
[2:13:30] talent he said this man wants to use
[2:13:33] me buried it shouldn't be like that man
[2:13:37] of one
[2:13:39] talent complaining all all the time
[2:13:42] suffering all the time again think of
[2:13:45] these
[2:13:46] meetings we are suffering with school
[2:13:49] fees again meetings are coming they
[2:13:52] postpone those
[2:13:54] meetings they for our
[2:13:56] good praise the name of get from your
[2:14:00] pocket praise the name of our lord make
[2:14:03] your
[2:14:05] contribution praise the name of yeah
[2:14:07] that is it pick from what you
[2:14:11] have and
[2:14:13] give but again we have
[2:14:16] ti we have offering in
[2:14:20] [Music]
[2:14:21] meetings it's a burden we
[2:14:24] have praise the name of and the next
[2:14:27] service God
[2:14:28] willing I want to talk about supporting
[2:14:31] missionary
[2:14:33] work we talk about
[2:14:36] it you know until we
[2:14:39] change. Praise the name of God. Until we
[2:14:43] change, we keep on talking about it. We
[2:14:46] keep on talking about you know, it's
[2:14:48] just like
[2:14:49] teachers, you don't get
[2:14:52] promoted if you've not learned these
[2:14:55] things. Like brother B was saying, how
[2:14:58] can I teach ABC?
[2:15:06] How can I How can I teach you
[2:15:11] algebra if you don't know
[2:15:13] ABC? Because algebra is 2 A + 3 C *
[2:15:19] this. The language is harder. So you
[2:15:23] start
[2:15:26] a V beginning
[2:15:30] things. We want to be blessed. We are
[2:15:33] blessed
[2:15:34] spiritually but want to be blessed
[2:15:38] physically. Let us get
[2:15:41] ourselves involving in the work of the
[2:15:44] king. Praise the name of our
[2:15:47] lord. So he
[2:15:50] says let us go to Genesis chapter
[2:15:56] 14 and then
[2:15:58] verse 18.
[2:16:04] I want to talk about tithing first then
[2:16:06] we can close.
[2:16:12] He
[2:16:16] says and the king of Salem brought forth
[2:16:20] bread and wine and he was the priest of
[2:16:23] the most high God. And he blessed him
[2:16:25] and said blessed be Abraham of the most
[2:16:28] high God possessor of the heaven and
[2:16:30] earth. And he blessed the most high God
[2:16:33] which had delivered the enemies into thy
[2:16:35] hand. And he gave him tices of all.
[2:17:12] Praise the name of the Lord. Abraham had
[2:17:14] got so many
[2:17:17] things. And when he met
[2:17:20] Melisedc, the king of Salem,
[2:17:24] the priest of the most high
[2:17:27] God, he
[2:17:29] recognized that it is God who has given
[2:17:32] me all the things.
[2:17:35] So of all the things God had given
[2:17:38] him, Abraham took
[2:17:41] 10% and said, "Lord, I give you all
[2:17:44] this." It was a
[2:17:47] revelation. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:17:50] Tithes were paid before the
[2:17:54] Lord. Abraham paid tithes by
[2:18:02] revelation. Praise the name of God. And
[2:18:05] so here the Bible says in Hebrews
[2:18:08] chapter
[2:18:09] 7 verse 6 to verse 9,
[2:18:14] but he whose descent is not counted from
[2:18:17] them which received titles of Abraham
[2:18:20] and blessed him that had the
[2:18:24] promises. Hebrews 7:6
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:52] Oh, Hebrews chapter 7 verse 6.
[2:19:05] Okay, let me read it. But he whose
[2:19:07] descent is not counted from them which
[2:19:09] received
[2:19:12] tithes of Abraham and blessed him that
[2:19:17] had the promises.
[2:19:31] So he said he received tith of
[2:19:36] Abraham and without all contradiction
[2:19:39] the less is blessed of the better. Verse
[2:19:52] seven. And here then here are men that
[2:19:55] die receive titles, but there he
[2:19:58] received them of whom it is witnessed
[2:20:00] that he liveth. And as I may say say,
[2:20:05] Levi also who received who receiveth
[2:20:08] tithes paid tithes in Abraham.
[2:20:42] So he says
[2:20:44] taxes. So Abraham paid
[2:20:48] tithes to marriage zedc. And then the
[2:20:51] bible says even levi who received tith
[2:20:55] from his
[2:20:57] brethren paid tithes in
[2:21:01] Abraham. And right now we are under the
[2:21:06] zedc and Abraham paid
[2:21:10] tith and we are the seed of
[2:21:13] Abraham. If we are the seed of
[2:21:16] Abraham, we need to do what Abraham
[2:21:20] did. Pay our tithe.
[2:21:24] Praise the name of Lord. Pay your
[2:21:26] tes of what the Lord has blessed you
[2:21:30] with. Praise the name of Lord. You of
[2:21:33] course don't get a
[2:21:35] loan and then the money they give you
[2:21:37] from the loan say I'm going to pay the
[2:21:40] tithe from
[2:21:41] this. That's not it. You pay
[2:21:45] taxes. Praise the name of our Lord from
[2:21:48] your
[2:21:50] increase. I have a capital of 10
[2:21:54] million. If it is a loan, put it into
[2:21:57] the business. Then what comes
[2:22:01] out, pay a
[2:22:04] tithe, you don't pay a tithe of the seed
[2:22:06] to
[2:22:09] sow. Praise the name of. But the thing
[2:22:12] is how have you got
[2:22:15] it? So now he says pay tithes of your
[2:22:21] increase in Deuteronomy chapter 14 verse
[2:22:27] 22. Thou shalt show the tithe all the
[2:22:30] increase of thy seed that thy field
[2:22:33] bringeth forth year by
[2:22:40] year. 14 14 verse 20 14 verse 22.
[2:22:59] So you pay tithe on your
[2:23:04] profit. You pay tithe on the
[2:23:09] increase what God has given you like a
[2:23:13] salary. You pay the tithe. If I'm a
[2:23:17] businessman, I know I made this amount
[2:23:19] of
[2:23:20] money. What is my margin of profit
[2:23:24] margin? I pay tithe on that.
[2:23:28] You don't pay tithe on your school
[2:23:31] fees. Praise the name of our Lord. Don't
[2:23:34] do that. But then you pay
[2:23:37] tithe from what you have
[2:23:40] gained. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[2:23:44] don't start calculating. Now I have to
[2:23:46] calculate this like
[2:23:50] this. Now you know my salary is 100,000.
[2:23:56] They have to remove
[2:23:57] NSS 5,000
[2:24:00] NSS. They have to remove as you earn
[2:24:04] 20,000. So I'm left with 75.
[2:24:08] So now 75 is what I'm going to pay from.
[2:24:11] But again I spend transport of
[2:24:15] 20,000. Then I feed every
[2:24:18] day. So what I'm left with is 10,000.
[2:24:23] Now 10,000 what I'm going to pay
[2:24:26] for. Is it what you've
[2:24:29] earned? Praise the name of people just
[2:24:33] start
[2:24:34] calculating this. This what she know.
[2:24:38] It's about willingness to do the right
[2:24:39] thing. Willingness to do the right
[2:24:42] thing. And then you just say okay let me
[2:24:44] bring this.
[2:24:47] You know, it's just like for
[2:24:49] example, if I'm
[2:24:51] getting
[2:24:56] 1,500
[2:24:59] tithe, 150
[2:25:04] shillings. But where are you going to
[2:25:06] get the 50
[2:25:09] shillings? You know, the other time I
[2:25:12] overpaid by 50 shillings. I put there
[2:25:15] 200
[2:25:20] So this time I'm only giving
[2:25:25] 100
[2:25:28] willingness. Praise the name of our
[2:25:30] lord. You know, attitude also matters in
[2:25:32] those
[2:25:34] things. Like if you're bringing your
[2:25:37] offering, you get those which have gone
[2:25:40] to the
[2:25:41] market, those which are
[2:25:44] torn which you can't keep in your
[2:25:51] pocket. There is a person very prominent
[2:25:55] person. He was in a
[2:25:57] church and now when they were collecting
[2:26:00] offerings he removed he had 10
[2:26:05] $100 20 then he picked from a lot he had
[2:26:10] then removed that it was
[2:26:17] $10 prominent
[2:26:21] person
[2:26:23] attitude praise the name of our Lord
[2:26:26] So Abraham paid
[2:26:29] taxes. Before the
[2:26:31] law, even Jacob paid
[2:26:35] taxes before the law. Genesis
[2:26:41] 28:20 says, "And Jacob a saying, if God
[2:26:47] will be with me and will keep me in this
[2:26:50] way that I go and will give me bread to
[2:26:54] eat and raignment to put on so that I
[2:26:57] come again to my father's house in
[2:27:00] peace, then the Lord shall be my God.
[2:27:34] And then verse 22, and this stone which
[2:27:38] I have set for a pillar shall be God's
[2:27:41] house, and of all that thou shalt give
[2:27:44] me, I will surely give the tenth unto
[2:28:01] thee. Now you see, Jacob
[2:28:04] In that
[2:28:05] situation, he was running away from
[2:28:09] Esau and then he was going to the
[2:28:11] mother's
[2:28:13] place without
[2:28:16] anything. Then he got tired along the
[2:28:19] place and he laid his head on a
[2:28:23] stone. Then he dreamt there was a ladder
[2:28:26] from where he was sleeping going to
[2:28:28] heaven. Angels
[2:28:30] ascending. They said, "This is the house
[2:28:33] of
[2:28:34] And when he realized he's in the
[2:28:35] presence of
[2:28:37] God, you can give me what to eat. You
[2:28:41] can give me what to drink and you keep
[2:28:43] me alive and you bring me back to my
[2:28:46] father's
[2:28:47] house. You pay
[2:28:50] everything, 10% of all that you've
[2:28:53] given. We need to have the same
[2:28:58] revelation. You started without
[2:29:02] anything but now God has given you
[2:29:05] ability. You are working. You have good
[2:29:08] health. You have strength. You have got
[2:29:12] promotion at your place of work through
[2:29:14] the place of work. You're
[2:29:16] working. You know, you've been able to
[2:29:19] buy clothes for yourself. You've been
[2:29:21] able to feed yourself. You've been able
[2:29:23] to buy this, buy that. You've been able
[2:29:26] to get a family. You've been able to
[2:29:29] raise your children. You've been able to
[2:29:31] get a home. You've been able to get
[2:29:33] means of trust. And then Jacob saying,
[2:29:37] "All that you will give
[2:29:39] me, I will give you a tenth
[2:29:43] and God is so
[2:29:45] faithful. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:29:48] We need to pay our
[2:29:50] tithes. Praise the name of our Lord. Be
[2:29:54] willing to be obedient to the word of
[2:29:57] God. Pay your
[2:29:59] tithes. Pay your
[2:30:01] offerings. Bring food in the
[2:30:04] storehouse. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:30:06] We are not going to be coming here every
[2:30:09] Sunday to remind
[2:30:12] ourselves. But let it be something as an
[2:30:16] obligation. This is my obligation as a
[2:30:19] church
[2:30:19] man. Prepare my tithes. Prepare my
[2:30:23] offerings. Praise the name of Lord. See
[2:30:26] what the Lord has done for your
[2:30:28] family. The protection of
[2:30:31] God. You know when people are going to
[2:30:34] those false
[2:30:36] teachers, you know they want people who
[2:30:38] will cheat
[2:30:41] them. He cheats you in this and then you
[2:30:44] believe he cheats you in this. We don't
[2:30:47] do that
[2:30:48] here. Oh, people who go to which
[2:30:52] doctors? You know which doctors? You get
[2:30:56] a
[2:30:57] home, they take a whole month or without
[2:31:00] eating a
[2:31:02] [Music]
[2:31:04] coke. Then the witch doctor says bring
[2:31:06] the white
[2:31:09] one. So for them they are raring
[2:31:12] for which doctors.
[2:31:17] They can't have opportunity to eat
[2:31:20] them. Then when he realizes maybe you
[2:31:22] have some more,
[2:31:25] bring a brown
[2:31:29] sheep. When he says, "Okay, you can
[2:31:32] do bring a white dog or black dog rather
[2:31:36] bring a white goat or black
[2:31:41] goat. Then for you are busy taking
[2:31:45] But the things we don't God has
[2:31:47] delivered us from all those
[2:31:50] things whereby you even sell your
[2:31:53] land because of a problem you
[2:31:56] have. You know there are people whose
[2:31:58] homes are so
[2:32:01] troubled. There are people who homes are
[2:32:04] so in
[2:32:06] danger. He has a son. The son has
[2:32:09] impregnated the neighbor's
[2:32:12] daughter. They are saying we want
[2:32:15] fine to millions. They go and sell part
[2:32:18] of the land. But here God has blessed
[2:32:22] you. But he has kept your children from
[2:32:24] doing those evil
[2:32:27] things. Your children are
[2:32:30] disciplined. You know they just not
[2:32:32] running out with men. They just running
[2:32:35] out with
[2:32:36] girls. They are not thieves that they
[2:32:39] have caught this one stealing. So you
[2:32:41] have to go and spend a lot of money to
[2:32:43] get that child out of
[2:32:46] prison. You know all these things God
[2:32:49] has blessed us
[2:32:51] with. You're not all the time in
[2:32:54] prison. You're not all the time in
[2:32:56] hospital. You're not all the time in
[2:32:58] this
[2:32:59] trouble. This
[2:33:01] chaos chaos. God's protection is around
[2:33:05] you. Then the Lord gives you the
[2:33:08] ability to earn a
[2:33:12] living from what you are earning just
[2:33:15] around
[2:33:16] 10%. Just bring your offerings
[2:33:19] on. It is not too
[2:33:21] much. Praise the name of God. It's not
[2:33:24] too
[2:33:25] much because God says I will bless
[2:33:29] you. I will multiply your
[2:33:34] increase. Praise the name of Now let us
[2:33:37] go to Ezekiel
[2:33:40] 44 and then verse 30.
[2:33:46] Praise the name of our Lord. I want so I
[2:33:48] can
[2:33:49] finish and so many things I've not
[2:33:52] reached
[2:33:53] to but I pray the Lord helps us.
[2:33:57] He
[2:33:58] says Ezekiel 4:30 says, "Thus shall they
[2:34:02] know that I, the Lord their God, am with
[2:34:06] them." Ezekiel 44:E 30, not 34.
[2:34:15] He says, "And the first of all, the
[2:34:18] first fruits of all things, and every
[2:34:20] oblation of all, of every sort of your
[2:34:23] oblations shall be the priestess. You
[2:34:26] shall also give unto the priest the
[2:34:29] first of your dove, that he may cause
[2:34:32] the blessing to rest in thine house.
[2:34:36] [Music]
[2:35:12] Praise the name of the Lord. So he says,
[2:35:14] "You shall give to the
[2:35:17] priesthood your
[2:35:19] offering." And then here he
[2:35:22] says that the
[2:35:24] priesthood may cause the
[2:35:27] blessing to rest in your house. And you
[2:35:30] all want our houses to be
[2:35:33] blessed. Your
[2:35:35] tes
[2:35:37] offerings, support the
[2:35:39] ministry, and then the blessings just
[2:35:41] come.
[2:35:43] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[2:35:45] blessings just
[2:35:46] come. Look what the stration of the
[2:35:48] Shunite
[2:35:52] woman. When she saw that there was a
[2:35:55] prophet, a man of
[2:35:56] God, he walks long distances to
[2:36:01] go, every morning he walks. She said,
[2:36:06] "Ah, why don't I build him a room by my
[2:36:09] house?"
[2:36:12] She got concerned about the burden of
[2:36:14] the
[2:36:15] ministry. We also need to be concerned
[2:36:18] about the burden of the
[2:36:21] ministry. And you don't lead to only a
[2:36:23] few
[2:36:24] people. But let us all be
[2:36:27] involved. Each of us has got a role to
[2:36:30] play in the
[2:36:31] kingdom. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:36:34] Like when they were building the
[2:36:35] tabernacle, there are people who are
[2:36:37] good at knitting.
[2:36:42] So they were knitting now those clothes
[2:36:44] to put around the
[2:36:46] temple. There are people who wear good
[2:36:48] to die
[2:36:50] clothes you know they were doing that
[2:36:53] kind of there are people who are good at
[2:36:56] maybe being iron and
[2:37:01] everything. Each of us has got a
[2:37:04] skill whereby we live
[2:37:07] by an income I generate from this kind
[2:37:10] of
[2:37:12] thing. Let me come and participate into
[2:37:14] the work of the
[2:37:16] king. And then the Bible says that a
[2:37:19] blessing may come in your
[2:37:22] house. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[2:37:25] know there are many challenges we go
[2:37:26] through in
[2:37:27] life. And you know when you read in the
[2:37:30] scriptures when God gave the children of
[2:37:33] Israel their
[2:37:35] inheritance, he told them also get
[2:37:38] cities for
[2:37:43] priests. And he says those cities of the
[2:37:47] priests are going to be cities of
[2:37:53] refuge
[2:37:55] who when you have made a
[2:37:59] problem. So he told them give cities of
[2:38:03] refuge to the
[2:38:06] priest that somebody who been chased
[2:38:08] from being
[2:38:10] killed can run into the city and get his
[2:38:15] protection. And many
[2:38:18] times we have challenges in
[2:38:21] life. Oh, I'm sick. I need you to come
[2:38:24] and pray for
[2:38:27] me. But it takes fuel to reach there.
[2:38:32] Oh, I have a problem. We've lost
[2:38:34] somebody. We want you to handle the
[2:38:37] barrier. It takes fuel to reach
[2:38:41] there. Of the
[2:38:43] denominations, you can't move until they
[2:38:46] send you
[2:38:48] fuel. If the bishop is the one
[2:38:51] coming
[2:38:54] 500,000, we don't ask
[2:38:56] that. But it's a
[2:38:59] need. And in some
[2:39:01] scenarios, they tell you, "We've lost
[2:39:04] somebody, but we also don't have a
[2:39:09] coffee. We don't have food to feed
[2:39:13] people. Pressure
[2:39:15] back, but you also have personal needs.
[2:39:22] So it is us to come
[2:39:25] out supply the
[2:39:28] storehouse. So if the storehouse those
[2:39:32] things at the end of the day they come
[2:39:35] back and help
[2:39:36] us I'm sick and I don't know what to
[2:39:40] do. But if now there's no contribution
[2:39:45] around our
[2:39:47] offerings cannot meet our
[2:39:50] debts. Why would you demand a church to
[2:39:52] pay for you
[2:39:55] something? Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:39:58] Yeah, that's the thing. If you don't put
[2:40:00] in, why would you want us to be
[2:40:06] given? Praise the name of God. So, we
[2:40:08] need to supply the
[2:40:11] storehouse that there is
[2:40:14] enough when there is a need
[2:40:16] somewhere. Okay, there is this need, you
[2:40:19] can do this kind of
[2:40:21] It's our
[2:40:23] responsibility. Praise the name of our
[2:40:24] Lord. It's not too much for us to do
[2:40:28] it. Let us be
[2:40:30] willing to pay our tithes and our
[2:40:34] offerings. It is for our good. Praise
[2:40:37] the name of our Lord. There's another
[2:40:39] scripture here in Numbers chapter
[2:40:43] 6 and verse 23.
[2:40:48] The Bible says, "Speak unto Aaron and
[2:40:50] unto his son, saying, on this wise you
[2:40:53] shall bless the children of Israel,
[2:40:56] saying unto them,
[2:41:08] The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The
[2:41:11] Lord make his face shine upon thee, and
[2:41:13] be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up
[2:41:15] his countenance upon thee, and give thee
[2:41:18] peace. And they shall put my name upon
[2:41:21] the children of Israel, and I will bless
[2:41:23] them.
[2:41:44] see how we are
[2:41:46] blessed. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:41:48] And when we come in the services of the
[2:41:52] Lord, we are blessed. Praise the name of
[2:41:55] our Lord. When prayer is made for you,
[2:41:57] you are
[2:41:58] blessed. When you pay your tithes, you
[2:42:01] are blessed. When you pay your
[2:42:03] offerings, you are
[2:42:04] blessed. When you support the
[2:42:07] ministry, you are blessed. We want God's
[2:42:10] blessings upon us.
[2:42:13] Praise the
[2:42:20] name. In other words,
[2:42:25] everything
[2:42:28] everything's
[2:42:30] land, houses, children,
[2:42:34] peace. Yeah, that's what we want in our
[2:42:37] places.
[2:42:39] Praise the name of so that you inviting
[2:42:42] another brother is not a
[2:42:45] problem. What are they going to eat
[2:42:48] again? I'm going to go into debt.
[2:42:50] No. I just go from my
[2:42:53] farm like
[2:42:55] Abraham. He didn't need to borrow
[2:42:57] anything.
[2:42:59] He told the young men, "Get that cuff,
[2:43:02] prepare it." That's how we need to be.
[2:43:06] There is the name of God that when you
[2:43:08] come to my
[2:43:09] home, I'm not going to be afraid. What
[2:43:12] are going to
[2:43:14] eat? You get one of the there, get
[2:43:17] one of those pigs. I got
[2:43:20] there. You're
[2:43:23] blessed. It's not headache for you to
[2:43:25] give.
[2:43:29] It's not ready for you to entertain your
[2:43:32] visitors. Why? You are blessed. Praise
[2:43:36] the name of the Lord. And we are blessed
[2:43:38] of the
[2:43:39] Lord. And as the Lord has blessed us,
[2:43:43] bring to the
[2:43:45] storehouse. Supply the
[2:43:47] storehouse. Don't restrain
[2:43:51] yourself. Now in the message God
[2:43:53] manifesting his
[2:43:55] gifts he says if God is
[2:43:58] God he is worth everything you
[2:44:03] are. If Christian religion is
[2:44:06] right it is worth everything that you
[2:44:09] can do for
[2:44:11] it. Support your
[2:44:13] church. Support your pastor. Support
[2:44:17] your missionaries.
[2:44:19] Do everything that's in your power to
[2:44:23] do
[2:44:26] and give to God the best you've
[2:44:30] got. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[2:44:33] support
[2:44:35] unreservedly. When there is a need Lord,
[2:44:39] I want to be
[2:44:40] blessed. You give in. Praise the name of
[2:44:44] our Lord. You come out and
[2:44:46] support. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[2:44:49] we need to see that we pay our
[2:44:51] taxes. We pay our
[2:44:53] offering. Regardless of how much you
[2:44:56] earn, see that you obey the word of
[2:45:00] God, Lord, from what you've given me,
[2:45:04] this is what I've brought you. Like
[2:45:06] those people who had the
[2:45:08] talents, the one who had five, the one
[2:45:11] who had two, he said, "Lord, from the
[2:45:13] five you gave me, I've got more fiber
[2:45:16] here. Lord, from the two you gave me,
[2:45:18] I've got more to hear. And I came with
[2:45:21] that kind of
[2:45:24] reverence. This is what I've done,
[2:45:27] Lord. Like now, today we are in church.
[2:45:31] Tomorrow we are out in the fields
[2:45:33] working. At the end of the week, Lord,
[2:45:37] from the whole
[2:45:39] week, I've come to present how you
[2:45:41] blessed
[2:45:42] me. I've brought my tithing. I've
[2:45:45] brought my offerings. I'm doing the
[2:45:47] support of the world. Praise the name of
[2:45:50] Lord. You are serving God in that
[2:45:53] kind. You are being
[2:45:56] identified as part of the kingdom of
[2:45:59] God. Abraham paid
[2:46:01] tithes. Jacob paid tithes. Even our
[2:46:06] brother, you know, there are so many
[2:46:08] things he talks about tithing and
[2:46:11] offering. We need to pay our tithes and
[2:46:14] our offerings.
[2:46:17] May God bless you so much.
[2:46:20] Amen. Amen.
[2:46:23] So, we have another service at
[2:46:27] 3. Praise the name of the Lord. Let us
[2:46:31] sing that song. Let us sing that song.

[2:55:06] rough. The roads are rough.
[2:55:11] often times storms with
[2:55:17] me. Sounds are
[2:55:20] weird. I get weary and sometimes I
[2:55:27] fail. Arrows of
[2:55:31] sin directed to kill my soul.
[2:55:38] How can I make it to the end without
[2:55:44] your hand? Oh my
[2:55:49] lord. Stuff with life's
[2:55:52] flesh. I get so scared.
[2:55:58] But though they
[2:56:01] weaken I rise.
[2:56:09] Yes. God bless
[2:56:23] you. This man says that he came here
[2:56:25] last Sunday.
[2:56:28] He says that he's a
[2:56:31] Muslim but he came when he has many
[2:56:36] problems. Seeing that he wanted to end
[2:56:39] his earthly
[2:56:41] life, they told him to come
[2:56:44] today and he has come
[2:56:48] again and today wants to give his life
[2:56:50] to Jesus Christ.
[2:56:54] So I want him to speak for himself and
[2:56:56] confess
[2:56:58] then we shall pray for him.
[2:57:03] [Music]
[2:57:07] I
[2:57:09] am. I have been a Muslim
[2:57:13] man and I also teach a
[2:57:18] lot. But God somehow I got the the
[2:57:21] intestine
[2:57:24] disease and they sent me for operation.
[2:57:33] They they took my saliva and they took
[2:57:35] my
[2:57:38] blood and they found that I have HIV and
[2:57:41] I have
[2:57:45] tuberculosis. Then they operated me and
[2:57:48] they told me they will start with
[2:57:51] her. I have a wife and I have children.
[2:57:57] When they check the wife, they didn't
[2:57:59] find her with the disease.
[2:58:06] When she saw like that, she came back
[2:58:07] and
[2:58:09] she
[2:58:10] [Music]
[2:58:21] stayed. I even fell down when I was
[2:58:23] bathing. Then I got this scar.
[2:58:26] hospital. They took me back the
[2:58:35] hospital. That's why I was wearing a
[2:58:37] mask. I'm on
[2:58:39] [Music]
[2:58:42] medicine. They told me that TB can be
[2:58:44] transferred. That's why I've been
[2:58:45] wearing the mask.
[2:58:51] So seeing the situation I'm going in, I
[2:58:52] don't have
[2:58:56] someone. I went to the mosque. They told
[2:58:58] me and they chased me
[2:59:03] up. But I came here when the prayers
[2:59:05] have
[2:59:11] ended. God help me and I found this man
[2:59:14] in a white shirt.
[2:59:18] I showed him all the papers even where
[2:59:20] he's sitting
[2:59:24] there. But I started from
[2:59:49] transport.
[2:59:56] [Music]
[3:00:08] [Applause]
[3:00:19] [Music]
[3:00:23] Amen. Father in the name of Jesus
[3:00:31] [Music]
[3:00:38] Christ went away and came back.

[3:02:13] heart with a song,
