[17:34] every one of
[17:35] them may you now speak to our hearts
[17:39] lording to purpose and
[17:45] will name Jesus Christ
[17:49] this amen let us go to the Book of John
[17:52] chapter
[17:55] 5 and then we're reading from verse 33
[17:58] to verse
[18:04] 36 so the Bible
[18:11] says he sent unto John and he bear
[18:15] witness unto the
[18:21] truth but I receive no testimony from
[18:23] man but the things I say that you might
[18:27] be saved
[18:35] he was a burning and Shining Light and
[18:38] you were willing for a season to rejoice
[18:41] in his
[18:54] light blessing his word may be seated
[18:59] so I want to preach on you are a shining
[19:06] light you are a shining
[19:08] light so now the Lord Jesus was telling
[19:12] the
[19:13] Jews that John the
[19:18] Baptist was a burning and Shining
[19:24] Light praise the name of the Lord he had
[19:27] a light that he brought
[19:31] in other words he brought the word of
[19:34] God he brought the message of
[19:38] God and you know God sent
[19:42] John at the time when the law was coming
[19:45] to the law was coming to an
[19:49] end the dispensation of the law was
[19:51] coming to an
[19:54] end and then we were getting into Grace
[19:59] and then
[20:00] John started a
[20:03] way and then he the message was baptism
[20:06] of
[20:09] repentance praise the name of our Lord
[20:12] baptism of
[20:14] repentance and then that was the message
[20:16] of
[20:17] John telling people there's one coming
[20:21] after
[20:22] me whose shoes I'm not able to
[20:26] unloose he says I bapt you with
[20:29] water but he shall baptize you with the
[20:32] Holy
[20:34] Spirit and fire so John came with that
[20:39] light it was a burning light it was a
[20:43] Shining
[20:45] Light people were asking
[20:48] John what shall we do praise the name of
[20:51] our Lord Pharisees came and asked him
[20:55] you know who are you then you know the
[20:58] the soldiers came to
[21:00] him what shall we do the publicans came
[21:04] to him watch the
[21:09] publicans what shall we do and then he
[21:12] was telling them what to
[21:15] do showing them the light that this is
[21:19] the light walk in this light this is the
[21:23] way walk in this way praise the name of
[21:26] our Lord and so now even
[21:29] Us Praise the name of our Lord once we
[21:32] receive the Gospel of Jesus
[21:36] Christ which is the light
[21:38] itself and then that gospel dwells in
[21:42] us and then that gospel transforms
[21:46] us it makes us to become
[21:50] Delight praise the name of our Lord we
[21:52] become The Shining
[21:54] Light that when the people see us
[21:58] like in Matthew Chapter
[22:00] 5 the Bible says you are the
[22:05] light okay us say
[22:09] 5:3 you are the salt of the earth but if
[22:13] the salt have lost his saver wherewith
[22:16] shall it be sorted it is than Force good
[22:19] for nothing but to be cast out and to be
[22:22] Tren under the foot of men
[22:44] are the light of the world a seat that
[22:47] is set on Hill cannot be hid
[23:04] neither do men light a candle and put it
[23:06] under bushel but on a Candlestick and it
[23:10] gives light unto all that are in the
[23:13] house
[23:29] let your light so shine before men that
[23:32] they may see your good works and glorify
[23:35] your father which
[23:48] in praise the name of our Lord so he
[23:51] says we are the light of the
[23:53] world and as the light of the world we
[23:57] need to shine forth his
[23:59] life and then he says when they see your
[24:02] good
[24:03] works then they will glorify the Father
[24:06] which is in
[24:07] heaven so we need to see that we allow
[24:10] the light of Jesus
[24:12] Christ because our Lord Jesus Christ is
[24:16] the light of the
[24:18] world when we go to John chapter
[24:21] one The Bible
[24:23] says let us go to John chapter
[24:26] one and then
[24:33] vers John 1
[24:36] vers
[24:40] four in whom was life and the life was
[24:44] the light of
[24:52] men and the light shineth in darkness
[24:56] and the Darkness comprehended
[25:03] not there was a man sent forth from God
[25:06] whose name was
[25:11] John the same came for a witness to Bear
[25:14] witness of the light that all men
[25:16] through him might
[25:25] believe he was not that light but was
[25:29] sent to Bear witness of that
[25:36] light that was the True Light which lith
[25:39] every man that comes into the
[25:50] world praise the name of our so our lord
[25:53] Jesus is that great
[25:56] light is the True
[25:59] Light praise the name of our Lord and
[26:02] then he says he came into the
[26:04] world he is the light that
[26:08] shines and you know you need light to
[26:10] see where you are
[26:12] going you need light to understand what
[26:16] is exactly
[26:18] happening and our Lord Jesus Christ is
[26:20] that true
[26:22] light and he is the
[26:25] word and then the Bible says the life
[26:28] that was in him is the light of
[26:32] men so that when we also receive the
[26:35] life of Jesus
[26:37] Christ how how do we receive the life of
[26:40] Jesus
[26:41] Christ we receive the life of Jesus
[26:44] Christ by accepting him as our personal
[26:49] savior when you accept the Lord Jesus
[26:52] Christ as your personal
[26:55] Savior and then you repent of your
[26:59] sins and then you are baptized in the
[27:02] name of Jesus
[27:03] Christ for the remission of your
[27:06] sins then he justifies
[27:09] you praise the name of our Lord he
[27:12] removes your past
[27:15] sin he removes your kind of things
[27:17] you've
[27:18] done the darkness that was
[27:21] there but right there in
[27:24] you there is still elements
[27:28] there is still a nature of Desiring to
[27:30] do wrong
[27:32] things so then Christ himself by his
[27:36] word starts working on that
[27:40] nature to see that the darkness goes
[27:43] away so he sanctifies you the more you
[27:47] obey the word of
[27:49] God the more you are
[27:52] Sanctified and then those works of
[27:55] darkness keep on departing
[27:58] and as they keep on going away you are
[28:01] being separated from the things that are
[28:03] contrary to God and so now when the men
[28:06] see your
[28:08] walk they see the light
[28:10] shining praise the name of the Lord we
[28:13] are a shining
[28:15] light and each of us should become a
[28:17] Shining
[28:19] Light a shining light at your
[28:22] home a shining light at your place of
[28:25] work a shining light at your school
[28:29] let them see your good
[28:31] works praise the name of our Lord where
[28:34] all the world would revenge in because
[28:35] somebody does them
[28:38] wrong then for you you pray with
[28:41] love that's light
[28:43] shining praise the name of our Lord when
[28:46] they see your good works they will
[28:49] glorify the Father which is in
[28:52] heaven praise the name of our Lord so we
[28:54] need to allow the light of Jesus Christ
[28:58] to completely take over our lives that
[29:01] we can also in
[29:03] turn become the light in the places that
[29:07] we praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[29:10] says we are written
[29:13] Epistles read of all
[29:15] men praise the name of our Lord so then
[29:18] you allow the word of God to influence
[29:23] you to change your thinking to change
[29:26] your mind
[29:28] to direct you praise the name of our
[29:31] Lord now in the
[29:34] message God's provided of approach to
[29:38] Fellowship he says our gracious Heavenly
[29:43] Father we are indeed privileged
[29:47] people that we can look into thy face
[29:49] and call thee Our
[29:53] Father knowing this that we have passed
[29:56] from Death un life
[30:00] because we have believed on the only
[30:02] begotten
[30:04] son and through his
[30:07] suffering and through suffering and
[30:10] dying and yes Rising again to live
[30:13] forever
[30:15] more we have eternal life through this
[30:19] faith in
[30:21] him then he says and there is many
[30:24] things in our
[30:26] lives that is not just
[30:30] right we are a people that walking in
[30:34] darkness in this
[30:37] world with that light we can find from
[30:44] heaven walking in the Dark
[30:47] World walking in the light as light
[30:49] flashes on our
[30:53] paths and we pray heavenly father that
[30:57] the light of
[30:58] God will so flash on our
[31:02] paths that we will be able to be a
[31:06] Shining Light to
[31:10] others that they may see the Glorious
[31:12] Gospel of the Lord
[31:15] Jesus and come into this Great
[31:19] Fellowship praise the name of our Lord
[31:22] we need also to be a shining
[31:24] light but you can't be a Shining Light
[31:28] if you don't walk in the light of Jesus
[31:31] Christ praise the name of our Lord so we
[31:34] need to walk in the light of Jesus
[31:36] Christ we need to be obedient to the
[31:39] word of
[31:40] God and now when we are obedient to the
[31:43] word of God that word becomes manifested
[31:46] in
[31:48] US it becomes a living
[31:52] reality and that life of the word
[31:55] becomes the light
[31:58] to the others praise the name of our
[32:00] Lord wherever you are
[32:02] living when you are manifesting the life
[32:05] of
[32:06] Jesus you are a shining light that is
[32:10] shining to all those people praise the
[32:13] name of our Lord when they see your good
[32:15] work then the Bible says they will
[32:18] glorify the Father which is in
[32:21] heaven so what we need to do is when we
[32:24] hear the word of
[32:26] God obedient to that word and the more
[32:30] you are obedient to that word the more
[32:33] the word changes your
[32:36] mind the word changes your decision
[32:40] making the word changes your
[32:44] desires the word changes all you know
[32:47] your
[32:49] influences and now when the word has
[32:52] changed your
[32:54] mind then now you have the mind of Jesus
[32:57] Christ
[32:59] even your words which come out of your
[33:01] mouth will be based on the mind of God
[33:04] that is in
[33:06] you and then even your
[33:09] actions the things that you
[33:12] do the things that you spend your time
[33:15] in will be dictated by the word that is
[33:18] in
[33:20] you and then there you'll not be
[33:22] dwelling in
[33:24] darkness but you'll be dwelling in the
[33:26] light
[33:28] and as you dwell in the light you
[33:30] produce the light praise the name of our
[33:33] Lord that's what God wants us to
[33:36] do every one of us praise the name of
[33:40] our Lord now in the message the great
[33:42] Shining
[33:44] Light he
[33:47] says what are we
[33:49] today we are
[33:52] stars every born again
[33:56] Christian is a testimony to the Lord
[33:59] Jesus
[34:01] Christ start reflect the power and
[34:03] Holiness of the Lord Jesus
[34:06] Christ reflect him in his
[34:11] life to perfect him in his
[34:15] speech to perfect him in his healing
[34:19] power to perfect him in his
[34:22] resurrection reflect him in every
[34:26] way that he was reflected To
[34:30] Us by the father We Are
[34:35] Stars watch what kind of star should you
[34:41] be then he says this star was not Guided
[34:46] by its own
[34:48] power it was Guided by the celestial
[34:51] powers of the almighty
[34:54] God so he was talking about that stud
[34:57] the wise men were
[35:00] following how they were following that
[35:02] St and as they followed that star the
[35:06] star LED
[35:08] them where Christ was praise the name of
[35:12] our Lord and we have seven stars for the
[35:14] seven Church
[35:17] ages praise the name of our Lord and the
[35:20] Stars praise the name of our Lord can be
[35:24] seen when there's Darkness
[35:28] and we see that through the
[35:30] ages there was Darkness so now God would
[35:33] send a start every
[35:36] age and then that star would
[35:39] Shine by The Power of the
[35:41] Gospel which the Lord would give that
[35:44] star and the Seven Stars were the seven
[35:48] messengers of the seven Church
[35:53] ages and we have had a star in our age
[35:57] praise the name of our Lord and that
[36:00] star
[36:01] shines praise the name of our Lord when
[36:04] the star of John Shine the way the star
[36:07] of John the Baptist
[36:10] shine telling them the sacrific of
[36:15] animals has come to an
[36:17] end now God requires you to

[36:26] Messiah
[36:27] Behold the Lamb of
[36:29] God what was he he was showing them the
[36:33] light praise the name of our so even in
[36:36] our day we have had a bright shining
[36:40] light praise the name of our Lord and
[36:43] that light when was
[36:46] shining
[36:47] preached get out from
[36:50] denominations praise the name of our
[36:52] Lord get from
[36:54] Trinity preach get out from infant

[37:11] preaching you know it was the light
[37:14] shining praise the name of our Lord
[37:17] bringing the Gospel of Jesus
[37:19] Christ to the time that we're
[37:22] living praise the name of our Lord so
[37:24] then he said
[37:29] there is therefore now no
[37:32] condemnation says okay let me get behind
[37:35] it was Guided by the celestial power of
[37:37] almighty
[37:40] God and if we are ever going to
[37:44] reflect Sinners to
[37:49] Christ we've got to be guided by the
[37:53] Holy
[37:54] Spirit Romans 81
[37:58] there is therefore now no
[38:01] condemnation to them that in
[38:04] Christ walk not after the
[38:08] flesh but after the spirit if we are
[38:11] going to be a
[38:13] star to reflect the Light of

[38:20] him we have going to be
[38:23] guided by the Holy Ghost praise the name
[38:27] of our Lord
[38:28] then he said and we cannot be
[38:31] unordinary we have to be
[38:35] unusual we cannot be
[38:37] us because God's people are a peul
[38:42] people they have been through the
[38:45] ages although

[40:40] there was gross
[40:41] darkness in the house of

[40:47] leprosy and then the Bible says he had
[40:50] done a lot of
[40:53] exploits God had used him to do a lot of
[40:56] things
[40:57] but now the Little M

[41:05] full of
[41:06] leprosy she become the light in that
[41:10] house praise the name of our Lord she
[41:13] gave a testimony that there there is a
[41:16] prophet in
[41:18] Israel if my
[41:20] master go to that prophet he would be
[41:23] healed of
[41:25] his and yet the Bible say
[41:28] there was no
[41:30] leper who was ever healed in the days of
[41:34] elishah but how did this girl
[41:37] know that there is a prophet and the
[41:40] prophet can help this
[41:42] man she was a God-fearing little
[41:46] girl so each and every one of us

[42:55] testimony of that made
[43:03] caus to go to his
[43:05] King and then the king wrote the king of
[43:09] Israel my servant has
[43:12] leprosy I'm told there healing
[43:15] there can you heal him and now you can
[43:19] imagine that the king of
[43:22] Israel the whole king of
[43:25] Israel didn't know
[43:28] that
[43:29] elishah can pray for somebody to be
[43:31] healed
[43:32] of can you imagine that until it was
[43:36] told the
[43:37] prophet that the king of Israel is
[43:41] complaining about the king of
[43:43] Syria why does he tell him to heal say
[43:47] am I going to
[43:48] heal then the prophet told them bring
[43:52] them tell them to come praise the name
[43:56] of our Lord and then the Lord Jesus
[43:58] Christ picks that
[44:01] testimony and he says there were many
[44:03] lepers in the days of
[44:06] el but elishah was not sent to
[44:11] anyone other than n
[44:14] Syrian how was he sent
