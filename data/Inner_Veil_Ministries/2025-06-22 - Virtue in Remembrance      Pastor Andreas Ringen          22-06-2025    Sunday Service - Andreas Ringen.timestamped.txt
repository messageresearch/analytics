[44:10] from this morning.

[45:01] Something surrounding uh Hebrews 13.
[45:07] Something is surrounding Hebrews 13:8.
[45:12] Maybe we will read it just at the end of
[45:14] the service
[45:17] so that we understand
[45:20] what makes him the same today.
[45:25] Don't we want to see him the same today?

[46:35] the Lord executed righteousness and
[46:36] judgment for all that are oppressed.
[46:45] He made known his ways unto Moses, his
[46:47] acts unto the children of Israel.
[46:53] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And all the
[46:56] church said, "Amen."
[46:58] Amen. Amen. The Lord is good and his
[47:02] mercy endures for us.
[47:04] So don't forget
[47:07] all that he has done.
[47:10] The virtue of remembrance.
[47:13] Let's go to Luke 24.
[47:16] Luke 24.
[47:19] Luke 24
[47:22] verse 13.
[47:39] We don't want to read the whole story.
[47:40] Maybe only two verses.
[47:44] And verse 13, and behold, two of them
[47:47] that went the same day to a village
[47:49] called Emmas, which was from Jerusalem
[47:52] about three score fur.
[47:57] We have to read.
[48:08] And they talked together of all the
[48:10] things which had happened.
[48:17] And it came to pass that while they
[48:19] communed together and reasoned, Jesus
[48:21] himself drew near and went with them.
[48:32] Amen. I just just want you to to focus
[48:36] now
[48:39] what is going on
[48:41] what Jesus is doing.
[48:44] Amen. Amen. First, did we have read
[48:47] verse 15? Yes. Yeah. 15. Okay. 16. 16.
[48:51] But their eyes were holden that they
[48:52] should not know him.
[48:58] And he said unto them,
[49:01] now catch this.
[49:04] He spoke to it to them. Now,
[49:08] what manner of communications are these
[49:11] that ye have one to another as you walk
[49:14] and are said?
[49:17] [Music]
[49:27] Amen. Jesus is asking a question.
[49:31] What are you talking about?
[49:34] Do you know that Jesus knew exactly what
[49:37] they were talking about?
[49:43] Amen.
[49:45] And yet he's asking a question.
[49:48] Watch very carefully what he's doing.
[49:52] And one of them which was Copas
[49:54] answering and said unto them, "Art thou
[49:57] only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast
[50:00] not known these things which are come to
[50:02] pass in these days?"
[50:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just watch now.
[50:16] He said unto them, "What things?"
[50:20] Jesus,
[50:23] what is he doing?
[50:31] What things
[50:37] is God not acting in a strange way?
[50:45] Oh, you are awake. That's fine. Right.
[50:48] We are right there. This can happen in
[50:51] our life.
[50:54] That God is acting unusual.
[50:58] He knows everything and yet he's asking.
[51:10] Is it not amazing? Come on church. He
[51:12] knows everything
[51:14] and yet he's asking
[51:16] what things
[51:28] and one of them verse 18 whose name was
[51:31] Cleopas answering oh no which is okay 19
[51:35] is this and they said unto them
[51:37] concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a
[51:39] prophet mighty indeed and word before
[51:42] God and all the people and how the chief
[51:44] priests and rulers delivered him and
[51:46] condemned him to death and have
[51:48] crucified him. But we trusted that it
[51:50] had been he which should be have
[51:52] redeemed Israel and beside this to the
[51:55] day the third day since the things were
[51:57] done. Okay, go and read it. Oh
[52:04] [Music]
[52:15] [Music]
[52:23] so far. So now they are explaining they
[52:26] are explaining
[52:28] to Jesus
[52:30] what Jesus knows already.
[52:37] You You're with me?
[52:39] Amen.
[52:41] What a what a what a strange action of
[52:43] God.
[52:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus Christ.
[52:53] Yes. The same yesterday.
[52:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my my my. Can
[53:01] we identify him already now in our
[53:03] lives?
[53:07] Sometimes it's so strange what God is
[53:09] doing.
[53:11] But he's doing it for a purpose.
[53:17] Hallelujah.
[53:19] Uh let's only read one verse,
[53:24] verse 27.
[53:26] Listen very carefully now.
[53:29] And beginning at Moses and all the
[53:32] prophets, he expounded unto them in all
[53:35] the scriptures the things concerning
[53:38] himself.
[53:48] he's doing now. You know what he's
[53:51] doing? He's remembering them
[53:56] for all the things that has happened.
[54:03] Let us pray. We want to be remembered in
[54:05] prayer this evening.
[54:08] Amen. Amen.
[54:11] Heavenly Father, Father, we have
[54:13] gathered together here.
[54:15] May you allow us for just a couple of
[54:17] minutes.
[54:19] Enter into the sinful, oh God.
[54:25] Enter into the drama
[54:27] that you have ordained
[54:30] that you have predestinated.
[54:33] Help us, Father,
[54:35] to do what we have to do to stay where
[54:38] we have to stay.
[54:40] in our position
[54:42] where you have placed us, Father, and
[54:45] reveal your word on us. For we pray it
[54:48] for your honor, for your glory in Jesus
[54:51] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God
[54:54] bless you. May be seated.
[54:56] And we want to speak on the virtue of
[54:58] remembrance.
[55:01] Remembrance
[55:03] because if we are remembered,
[55:06] it starts stimulating something.
[55:10] It's a it's a terrible thing if we
[55:12] forget.
[55:15] Forgetting what God has done
[55:19] leads you into confusion.
[55:21] [Music]
[55:23] It leads you into confusion.
[55:25] David when he wrote the psalm
[55:29] and he would tell us forget not what he
[55:30] has done.
[55:33] David knew what he was talking about.
[55:37] David came to places in his life
[55:40] and he had for he had seemingly
[55:42] forgotten all that God has done for him.
[55:47] Remember when when there was a time when
[55:49] we can read in the Bible
[55:52] and here we want to come a little bit to
[55:54] our subject already.
[55:57] Amen. To to see what God wants us to do
[55:59] in this last hour.
[56:02] Amen. God wants us to do what we can do.
[56:06] He never wants you to do something you
[56:08] cannot do.
[56:10] Amen. He He wants you to have faith that
[56:13] you can have.
[56:17] He wants you to have faith according to
[56:19] the measure that he has given to you.
[56:22] He never wants you to have something
[56:25] that he has not given unto you.
[56:29] Can we say praise the Lord? Hallelujah.
[56:32] Amen. So God knows exactly what he has
[56:34] given you.
[56:36] Amen. God knows exactly what you need.
[56:41] All what you need, God has given to you
[56:45] for your life journey.
[56:47] In Christ, all things are granted unto
[56:50] us.
[56:51] Amen. Amen. But as we was reading here,
[56:53] this actually this scripture about the
[56:56] Emo's disciples.
[56:59] Now maybe special first David
[57:02] you know David came his in his life
[57:05] and David you know David had that that
[57:07] uh uh it was passed he was already
[57:10] crowned king.
[57:14] Amen. Oh, so remember all the time the
[57:16] prophet coming to the house of Jesse,
[57:20] David being anointed,
[57:23] David, David growing, David killing
[57:26] Goliath,
[57:28] that was all behind him,
[57:31] war that had all happened over there.
[57:34] David was king over Judah.
[57:36] David was king over Jerusalem.
[57:39] Amen. Amen. All that has happened. Amen.
[57:43] All that has happened.
[57:45] He was in position
[57:47] and then it came a time you know when he
[57:50] wrote this psalm
[57:53] it had a purpose that he wrote it
[57:56] a purpose telling us don't forget his
[57:59] benefits
[58:02] and I want to let you know this evening
[58:05] don't forget what God has done for you
[58:09] always remember yourself
[58:12] what God has done for You
[58:15] always bring that up.
[58:18] Always allow the Holy Spirit.
[58:21] There's a virtue in remembrance.
[58:25] Remembrance stimulates you.
[58:28] Amen. Remembrance quickens you.
[58:31] Remembrance gives life.
[58:34] When you know what God has done to for
[58:36] you, it satisfies you. If you are
[58:40] looking for something, if you're really
[58:42] hunting for something, first remember
[58:45] what he has already done for you
[58:48] because that satisfies you. You
[58:50] understand that? That gives you peace.
[58:53] That gives you peace in time.
[58:56] When you when you are in the midst of
[58:57] the stone
[58:59] and remembrance comes to you that he
[59:02] saved you out of a stone,
[59:04] it doesn't matter how big the stone is.
[59:07] You know, he saved me out of this storm.
[59:09] That gives you peace in this.
[59:12] Amen. Amen. And David wrote this. You
[59:16] understand the Bible would say, we if we
[59:20] don't turn to it, but I think it is in
[59:23] first kings
[59:25] or or no, in first Samuel. It is
[59:29] 1 Samuel.
[59:31] Don't turn to it. You can read it at
[59:32] home. 11
[59:35] after you know when David wrote this
[59:38] psalm
[59:40] don't forget what God has done for you
[59:43] he that heal our our diseases
[59:46] amen
[59:48] when David wrote that psalm
[59:51] he came out of a great trial
[59:55] and he came great out of a great great
[59:57] uh um uh big big problem
[1:00:02] that he had brought himself into
[1:00:06] by forgetting what God has done.
[1:00:09] Now remember, David was king.
[1:00:13] Goliath had happened. Goliath was
[1:00:15] killed.
[1:00:17] And you know, David didn't didn't kill
[1:00:19] Goliath.
[1:00:21] It was God doing through David.
[1:00:25] David understood.
[1:00:27] I had no strength to throw the stone.
[1:00:30] David actually saw the stone coming
[1:00:32] down.
[1:00:34] As David threw the stone,
[1:00:37] he was too weak.
[1:00:39] He had no no strength. But when the
[1:00:42] stone came down, the Holy Spirit get
[1:00:44] under the stone. And the Bible said the
[1:00:49] stone went into the forehead of Christ
[1:00:54] and he stuck.
[1:00:59] You know how much speed it must have
[1:01:01] been
[1:01:05] to that the stone stuck in his head.
[1:01:09] So David understood.
[1:01:11] This was the Lord's.
[1:01:13] This was not my strength. Not by not by
[1:01:17] might not by strength but by my spirit
[1:01:20] says the Lord. So we have to remember
[1:01:23] ourselves.
[1:01:25] Now as David as David all of this had
[1:01:27] happened
[1:01:29] and David came David was anointed king
[1:01:33] the Bible said there came a certain time
[1:01:36] when the kings went to battle
[1:01:40] you can read it in first Samuel 11
[1:01:44] there came a certain time when all the
[1:01:46] kings went to battle
[1:01:49] but David decided
[1:01:52] to stay home. David decided not to go.
[1:01:57] David decided to stay to stay at home
[1:02:01] and there is where he fall with Baja.
[1:02:09] Uh-huh.
[1:02:13] Okay. Uh,
[1:02:17] you know what?
[1:02:19] David was king,
[1:02:22] anointed king.
[1:02:25] It was his duty
[1:02:28] to lead the group into battle.
[1:02:33] That was not a great work.
[1:02:35] That was just his duty as king.
[1:02:39] But he neglected his duties.
[1:02:42] And because he neglected his duties,
[1:02:46] the form with Bacha came.
[1:02:49] And when David came out of it,
[1:02:52] you know how that hurted David.
[1:02:55] Hallelujah.
[1:02:57] And always when we neglect our duties,
[1:03:03] it finally hurts us.
[1:03:06] It weakens us.
[1:03:11] You understand? We don't have time to go
[1:03:12] into it, but just to show you David was
[1:03:16] anointed king.
[1:03:18] So, so it was not a special thing.
[1:03:21] He just should lead the group. That was
[1:03:24] his kingly duty.
[1:03:27] Amen. And because he neglected that,
[1:03:31] he fell with Bashibba.
[1:03:35] And you know how much that weakened
[1:03:37] David?
[1:03:38] You know how much that because now David
[1:03:41] remember he sp he spoke his own judgment
[1:03:45] when the prophet came to when the
[1:03:47] prophet came to his house. David spoke
[1:03:50] his own judgment
[1:03:52] and Satan was hunting him
[1:03:55] showing him what he has done.
[1:03:58] And remember, David became so weak
[1:04:02] because of the mistake
[1:04:05] even was counting the people.
[1:04:11] He became so weak that he was counting
[1:04:14] the people.
[1:04:16] Satan told him, he said, "You know what?
[1:04:20] You have done such a great mistake
[1:04:23] and and my goodness
[1:04:25] I think you have lost all your strength.
[1:04:28] You have lost everything who you are. So
[1:04:31] you need you need to be sure how many
[1:04:34] people you are still with you.
[1:04:36] So you better count
[1:04:39] how big is your church still?
[1:04:41] Do you go is your church still small or
[1:04:45] is only a small church. Brother, sister,
[1:04:50] the size of the church.
[1:04:52] It's never important
[1:04:54] how big the dog is.
[1:04:57] It is important how big the fight in the
[1:05:00] dog is.
[1:05:06] But you understand
[1:05:08] how David became so weakened
[1:05:11] that Satan could tell him, "Count your
[1:05:13] people." And you know how God get upset.
[1:05:18] He he said he said to David
[1:05:21] you have done a terrible thing. He said
[1:05:25] terrible thing. You have counted the
[1:05:27] people.
[1:05:29] Is that right? And you know the judgment
[1:05:32] that came out of it all because David
[1:05:37] had forgotten what the Lord has done for
[1:05:39] him.
[1:05:46] Allow me to go that line.
[1:05:50] Why was God upset?
[1:05:53] Why was God upset with David
[1:05:56] counting the people? He said, "David,
[1:05:59] you have done a terrible thing. Now you
[1:06:02] can choose. This trouble, that trouble,
[1:06:05] or that trouble.
[1:06:08] Why was God so upset?"
[1:06:11] Why was God so upset? You know why?
[1:06:14] David had lost his faith in what God
[1:06:19] said he was.
[1:06:26] Do we still have faith?
[1:06:29] What God said,
[1:06:31] we are.
[1:06:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You understand
[1:06:40] that?
[1:06:41] So David had not lost confidence in God.
[1:06:48] He was trusting God.
[1:06:50] He had not lost confidence in God.
[1:06:54] But David, David had lost confidence
[1:06:59] in what God said he is.
[1:07:04] You can follow me.
[1:07:07] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And if we do
[1:07:10] wrong things, we lose confidence
[1:07:14] in what God said we are.
[1:07:22] Amen. Amen. And you understand it all
[1:07:26] came
[1:07:28] from forgetting
[1:07:30] what God has done.
[1:07:35] That's why I have the great privilege
[1:07:36] this evening.
[1:07:39] to remind you
[1:07:42] all the things that God has done for us.
[1:07:46] And I I was sure as I remind you,
[1:07:50] he that heal all of our diseases.
[1:07:55] Can I see your hands that God is still a
[1:07:58] healer?
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:00] Can you see your hands? When God healed
[1:08:02] you,
[1:08:05] never forget.
[1:08:07] Never forget and he is a healer of your
[1:08:09] life.
[1:08:15] Regardless
[1:08:16] of the circumstances you are in,
[1:08:19] regardless
[1:08:21] of the sickness that you are fighting,
[1:08:25] remember
[1:08:27] that he is a God that heals all of our
[1:08:29] diseases.
[1:08:33] There's a virtue in remembrance.
[1:08:36] Virtue in remembrance.
[1:08:40] Amen. And David had understood
[1:08:42] as I has forgotten.
[1:08:45] Look where I landed.
[1:08:48] I landed
[1:08:51] in doubting myself.
[1:08:54] I so little confidence
[1:08:57] in who I am.
[1:08:59] Yet God said who I am.
[1:09:01] But because of my mistake, I lost all my
[1:09:04] confidence.
[1:09:08] Come on, church.
[1:09:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do we still
[1:09:12] believe
[1:09:14] what God said about us?
[1:09:17] Do we still believe?
[1:09:19] Do we still believe the Bible says there
[1:09:23] will be a bride
[1:09:26] without spot and wrinkle?
[1:09:33] That's me.
[1:09:36] That's me. This is what he said about
[1:09:40] me. It is not important what I think
[1:09:43] about myself.
[1:09:46] It is important what he is saying about
[1:09:48] me.
[1:09:50] This message
[1:09:52] declares
[1:09:54] what God thinks about you.
[1:09:59] When you think you are from Uganda,
[1:10:04] God said no, you come from heaven.
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:10] Hallelujah. If you wake up in the
[1:10:13] morning,
[1:10:14] look into the mirror and you said, he
[1:10:17] said, "That flesh is me."
[1:10:20] God said, "No, that flesh is not really
[1:10:23] you. The inside is you.
[1:10:27] [Applause]
[1:10:29] Can we say praise the Lord? Amen. Church
[1:10:33] is so important. There's such a virtue
[1:10:36] of remembrance.
[1:10:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And as we and
[1:10:41] David understood it. He understood why
[1:10:44] he landed in that condition
[1:10:47] where he was total doubt in himself.
[1:10:52] He became so weak
[1:10:54] that he spoke to one of his generals.
[1:10:58] Can you not count the people that is
[1:10:59] still with us?
[1:11:02] We have to fight against kings and
[1:11:04] kingdoms.
[1:11:06] How how great is our
[1:11:09] is it not sometimes
[1:11:12] that we look into our church
[1:11:15] how many people are still there.
[1:11:23] Oh, we rather go we rather go to the
[1:11:25] bigger church than the smaller.
[1:11:32] Is that right? Come on, church.
[1:11:45] Amen. You understand? But David came and
[1:11:50] God was so upset with him.
[1:11:53] God said, "David,
[1:11:55] have you forgotten Goliath?
[1:11:58] Who was that?" And David said, "That was
[1:12:01] you."
[1:12:02] What do you think about? It was always
[1:12:05] me
[1:12:08] because you are my partner.
[1:12:11] So God was so upset because David has
[1:12:15] lost the confidence.
[1:12:19] in who he was.
[1:12:22] Church, have we lost confidence?
[1:12:26] And what the word said we are.
[1:12:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If we are one or
[1:12:38] two or 10 or 20, who cares?
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:42] If the whole world is against us, who
[1:12:44] cares?
[1:12:47] If they close this church down, who
[1:12:49] cares?
[1:12:53] If I'm left alone, who cares?
[1:12:57] With God,
[1:13:00] all things are possible.
[1:13:02] With God, all things are possible. If
[1:13:06] I'm tomorrow alone at home,
[1:13:09] who cares?
[1:13:16] Amen. Come on, church.
[1:13:21] I don't know how to say.
[1:13:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. David
[1:13:26] understood.
[1:13:27] You're with me.
[1:13:29] [Applause]
[1:13:33] For forgetting
[1:13:35] who you are. Forgetting what God has
[1:13:38] done
[1:13:39] brings neglecting your duties.
[1:13:46] Because if you if you if you forget what
[1:13:48] God has done,
[1:13:50] the motivation goes down
[1:13:52] and then we neglect our duties.
[1:13:55] We just find an easy way.
[1:13:58] Like David when the when the kings were
[1:14:02] meeting for battle,
[1:14:05] he should have been in the forefront
[1:14:07] leading Israel into battle. That was his
[1:14:10] normal duty.
[1:14:15] Is that right?
[1:14:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But he neglected
[1:14:20] that. And out of neglectings of duty,
[1:14:26] you understand what God is doing today.
[1:14:29] What does God is doing tonight?
[1:14:32] Allow me to read you to you a a a
[1:14:34] statement of the prophet
[1:14:36] [Music]
[1:14:38] out out of out of the message. This day
[1:14:40] the scripture is fulfilled.
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:45] The last page.
[1:14:47] He said, "I have read the scripture
[1:14:50] with dozen or more evidences
[1:14:55] that we're living in the last day
[1:14:58] that the generation
[1:15:01] remember this morning.
[1:15:03] There's a generation left.
[1:15:07] You are that generation.
[1:15:10] If you're calculating this, you see
[1:15:13] there's one generation missing
[1:15:16] is placed for you for this last
[1:15:18] generation.
[1:15:20] The generation
[1:15:22] that will Jesus Christ
[1:15:25] see Jesus Christ return to earth.
[1:15:33] And I say to you tonight
[1:15:36] again
[1:15:37] this day this scripture is fulfilled.
[1:15:43] So Jesus Christ
[1:15:46] can I remember you?
[1:15:50] Can I put you into remembrance
[1:15:53] that Jesus Christ came back to earth
[1:15:56] again?
[1:15:58] Amen.
[1:16:00] We are not looking for his coming.
[1:16:04] We are waiting for the going.
[1:16:08] Because brother said, "My ministry is to
[1:16:12] declare him.
[1:16:14] He is here now.
[1:16:17] [Applause]
[1:16:18] I want to put you in remembrance.
[1:16:22] The second coming
[1:16:24] is going on.
[1:16:29] Amen. Amen. Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:16:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I want to
[1:16:34] remind you, you are a part of that
[1:16:37] coming
[1:16:39] because the second coming
[1:16:41] will be a mysterious coming.
[1:16:44] He will come as a thief.
[1:16:49] Is that correct? Son of man will come as
[1:16:52] a thief.
[1:16:55] When a thief comes, what is he coming
[1:16:58] for?
[1:17:00] The thief is coming for the most
[1:17:02] valuable thing
[1:17:06] that is in your house.
[1:17:08] So when the son of man comes as a thief,
[1:17:13] the most valuable thing on earth
[1:17:17] is the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:22] I want to remember you.
[1:17:24] You have value in the sight of God.
[1:17:28] That's why he came to you.
[1:17:30] You have value in God's sight.
[1:17:33] You have value.
[1:17:35] Regardless if you are black or white,
[1:17:39] boy or girl, married or unmarried,
[1:17:45] minister or leoty,
[1:17:49] you have value in the sight of God.
[1:17:52] Come on, church. Hallelujah. You have
[1:17:55] value.
[1:17:56] That's why I want to encourage you.
[1:17:59] Don't try to be somebody else.
[1:18:03] Be what you are. Be a Christian.
[1:18:08] Hallelujah. If you have time this
[1:18:10] evening,
[1:18:11] we go shortly to a few things
[1:18:16] to show that God needs you.
[1:18:19] the way he he orchestrated you.
[1:18:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, I want to
[1:18:27] encourage you.
[1:18:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't be up.
[1:18:31] Don't be sad with your situation.
[1:18:37] Amen. Serve God.
[1:18:40] Wherever you are,
[1:18:42] whoever you are,
[1:18:44] as the sisters, the sisters again, sing
[1:18:46] the song.
[1:18:48] Worship him.
[1:18:50] Whoever you are, wherever you are and
[1:18:54] what condition you are in, if you are
[1:18:56] sick, worship him.
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you are
[1:19:03] worried, worship him.
[1:19:06] [Applause]
[1:19:09] Hallelujah.
[1:19:12] I want you to reme I want you to
[1:19:13] remember you
[1:19:17] now
[1:19:19] as we want to take that story
[1:19:22] we have seen with David
[1:19:25] how David understood
[1:19:27] how important remembrance is
[1:19:31] amen
[1:19:32] and
[1:19:35] you know follow the principles of the
[1:19:36] Bible
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:42] Oh, I think it's so beautiful.
[1:19:45] We was reading this morning.
[1:19:48] We was reading about Abraham
[1:19:51] unconditional covenant
[1:19:55] and yet he had to do things.
[1:19:58] Amen.
[1:20:01] Amen. My my I I pray
[1:20:06] that the Lord helps me and you
[1:20:11] to enter into this.
[1:20:14] Amen. Amen. Who's ready for it?
[1:20:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Watch. Watch
[1:20:23] with Abraham and Sarah.
[1:20:26] Now here Elohim comes
[1:20:30] Elohim comes to Abraham
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:33] and and
[1:20:35] Elohim has
[1:20:37] disguised him.
[1:20:42] Brother Brandon would tell us he told
[1:20:45] two other angels,
[1:20:47] "Let's go down."
[1:20:50] And he made himself a body
[1:20:53] the
[1:20:55] come into it and it came down to earth
[1:20:58] in flesh. Is that right? But now this
[1:21:03] was not naked flesh.
[1:21:06] It was closed.
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:10] Had they dressed like brother
[1:21:14] Ibalis maybe
[1:21:17] or maybe like brother Samson
[1:21:19] or maybe like your dress
[1:21:34] or maybe my dress
[1:21:41] if I go outside here on the streets of
[1:21:43] Ginger.
[1:21:46] Even if I would paint my face,
[1:21:54] the people would know
[1:21:56] I'm not an African.
[1:22:05] Even if I would paint myself pitch
[1:22:07] black,
[1:22:10] the people when they look at me,
[1:22:13] they see my clothing,
[1:22:16] they see my actions.
[1:22:21] That's not an African.
[1:22:26] You're with me.
[1:22:29] So they would understand
[1:22:32] that I'm a stranger.
[1:22:42] Watch now. Watch now.
[1:22:44] As Abraham was sitting in the tent door,
[1:22:50] Sarah was at home
[1:22:53] in a very bad situation
[1:23:00] and she had forgotten
[1:23:03] all that God has done for her.
[1:23:06] She had become old. She was grumpy.
[1:23:10] Every day she had a fight with Abraham.
[1:23:19] You might believe it. This is what
[1:23:21] brother Random said.
[1:23:24] Lot of fights at home
[1:23:27] because she was tired of waiting.
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:35] Remember when Elohim told her, "You will
[1:23:38] have a son."
[1:23:40] telling to Abraham wife Sarah will have
[1:23:42] a son. She said me an old woman.
[1:23:50] Come on in this condition Sarah was
[1:23:55] happy home.
[1:24:02] You're with me
[1:24:04] now. He was Abraham one church just just
[1:24:07] to show you
[1:24:09] This is our normal life.
[1:24:12] Situations come that we don't expect
[1:24:17] not running the way we want them to run.
[1:24:21] Sometimes frustration in our home,
[1:24:24] sometimes frustration in the church.
[1:24:29] Is it right?
[1:24:32] Yes.
[1:24:35] Now Abraham was sitting in the tent
[1:24:37] door,
[1:24:40] not in the cool of the evening,
[1:24:44] but in the heat of the day.
[1:24:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You get the
[1:24:54] picture.
[1:24:56] You get the picture.
[1:24:58] Suddenly
[1:25:01] he see three men walking.
[1:25:04] He's sitting there in the tent door
[1:25:09] watching the people.
[1:25:12] He was watching the people
[1:25:14] and suddenly saw
[1:25:17] three people. The Bible said he saw
[1:25:20] three men
[1:25:22] and they were certain way closed.
[1:25:26] They had a certain dress on.
[1:25:29] So when he saw them, he understood
[1:25:32] those guys are strangers.
[1:25:40] You understand that?
[1:25:43] Remember on the way to Emos?
[1:25:47] Here was Jesus walking
[1:25:50] with his disciples.
[1:25:53] You understand? A day before they had
[1:25:55] fellowship with one another.
[1:25:59] Now he had a different dress on.
[1:26:03] Amen.
[1:26:05] Yes, sir. And he's asking questions,
[1:26:08] why are you sad?
[1:26:14] No. If I would ask brother Samson, what
[1:26:18] is your name?
[1:26:20] What is your name? Samson.
[1:26:24] I know,
[1:26:26] but I still ask him.
[1:26:32] You get the picture, church.
[1:26:35] Jesus is acting.
[1:26:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:45] He said, "What's wrong with you?
[1:26:49] Why are you so sad?
[1:26:54] Listen to what they said.
[1:26:56] Are you the only stranger?
[1:27:04] So watch. Listen, church. Very
[1:27:06] important. Come on, church.
[1:27:09] Oh, there's something good coming up, I
[1:27:11] tell you.
[1:27:13] But we want to do it as a little drama.
[1:27:17] This is our life.
[1:27:20] Many times our life is like drama.
[1:27:25] But you know what? God loves drama.
[1:27:32] God loves drama.
[1:27:36] When all beauty was in Eden,
[1:27:39] [Music]
[1:27:40] he allowed the serpent to come in.
[1:27:50] Uh-huh.
[1:27:52] God loves drama.
[1:27:55] God loves drama
[1:27:58] because in drama
[1:28:01] he can show who he is.
[1:28:05] Hallelujah.
[1:28:08] Are you the only one?
[1:28:12] I see your clothing. Yes. And your
[1:28:15] reaction.
[1:28:17] It looks like you weren't here the last
[1:28:20] couple of days.
[1:28:23] You should be a stranger.
[1:28:28] Is it not amazing?
[1:28:30] Why did Jesus not say, "Hey, brothers,
[1:28:34] it's me."
[1:28:38] He's playing.
[1:28:43] [Music]
[1:28:46] Hallelujah.
[1:28:48] Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:28:51] Why is God not coming straight to you
[1:28:56] telling you it's me and you are that
[1:29:01] you are the bride? Why is not God doing
[1:29:04] that?
[1:29:06] Because he loves drama.
[1:29:14] Yes. My God loves drama.
[1:29:22] He likes to come on the water.
[1:29:26] And the same people
[1:29:28] that had fellowship in couple of hours
[1:29:30] ago
[1:29:32] say it's a ghost. It's a ghost.
[1:29:36] It's me. It's me.
[1:29:42] [Laughter]
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:48] Watch, watch. Now you understand that
[1:29:53] said,
[1:29:55] "Are you the only stranger?"
[1:29:59] And Jesus acting stupid
[1:30:03] said, "What do you mean?
[1:30:05] Tell me."
[1:30:08] Yeah, you know about Jesus
[1:30:12] and he was standing there.
[1:30:18] You understand? Come on, church. So
[1:30:21] blind.
[1:30:24] Blinded by circumstances.
[1:30:29] How many time? How many times we are
[1:30:31] blinded by circumstances?
[1:30:34] It is the Lord the whole time.
[1:30:38] just acting out his drama,
[1:30:41] just acting. He wants you to be a part
[1:30:44] of it.
[1:30:46] It's the time is over
[1:30:49] for just sitting in the church seat.
[1:30:52] It's time that you become active in the
[1:30:54] drama.
[1:30:57] God is calling you into the drama now.
[1:31:03] No, I don't know. Strange.
[1:31:08] Tell me about this
[1:31:10] about we thought he is the Messiah.
[1:31:13] Why we have seen we thought we thought
[1:31:16] he would just destroy Rome
[1:31:20] and there was some strange we have some
[1:31:22] strange sisters in our church.
[1:31:26] They started the new doctrine
[1:31:30] that that he is risen.
[1:31:33] What do you what do you think about it?
[1:31:39] You understand that
[1:31:42] Jesus is saying
[1:31:44] that's strange.
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:50] [Laughter]
[1:31:57] Can we give him a hand of praise?
[1:32:01] This is our God.
[1:32:04] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:32:10] I can I can imagine
[1:32:13] now this is our God right.
[1:32:16] I can imagine
[1:32:19] Abraham. He was now happy father of
[1:32:22] Isaac.
[1:32:25] Isaac was six years old
[1:32:28] and he was playing and he was so happy.
[1:32:32] And one day the Lord said, "Abraham,"
[1:32:35] he said, "Yes, Lord."
[1:32:37] Abraham, take thy son, thy only son,
[1:32:42] "Take Isaac, and sacrifice him to me.
[1:32:53] You're joking."
[1:32:58] What did Abraham say? He said, "Yes,
[1:33:01] Lord.
[1:33:05] Come on, church.
[1:33:14] You know who was confused?
[1:33:17] Hell was confused.
[1:33:24] All the demons
[1:33:26] that was trying to get Abraham away from
[1:33:28] the promise.
[1:33:32] was going to the big boss
[1:33:35] and saying, "Have you heard?"
[1:33:41] And Satan said, "I don't understand it
[1:33:43] myself."
[1:33:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, we serve a
[1:34:00] wonderful God. Church,
[1:34:06] I believe we are here in Africa
[1:34:09] and you are very emotional people
[1:34:13] which I really which I really enjoy.
[1:34:16] You can say praise the Lord
[1:34:19] because God is doing a miraculous work
[1:34:21] in this.
[1:34:23] It should not confuse us what God is
[1:34:25] doing
[1:34:27] as the royal seed of Abraham.
[1:34:31] It should not confuse us what God is
[1:34:33] doing right now.
[1:34:35] It should only confuse hell.
[1:34:39] What God is doing
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:34:44] [Applause]
[1:34:50] Follow the story.
[1:34:52] We agree quickly. We go quickly. It's
[1:34:54] beautiful.
[1:34:56] Now, Abraham also Abraham sitting at the
[1:34:59] tent door
[1:35:02] and he's watching.
[1:35:04] You know, he's looking out
[1:35:07] for what?
[1:35:10] For what? Is Abraham looking out? Why is
[1:35:12] he sitting in the studio?
[1:35:15] He's not laying on his bed. He's not
[1:35:18] meditating. He's sitting and looking
[1:35:22] because Abraham had something to do.
[1:35:29] You have something to do.
[1:35:32] You have something to do.
[1:35:35] It is not a condition.
[1:35:38] The covenant is without condition.
[1:35:41] Hallelujah. The covenant is without.
[1:35:45] But you have something to do because you
[1:35:48] are God's partner.
[1:35:53] That's why you have something to do.
[1:35:57] My wife is my partner.
[1:36:02] Amen.
[1:36:03] She brings life to earth.
[1:36:09] She is manifesting me.
[1:36:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. As a bride of
[1:36:19] Jesus Christ,
[1:36:21] you are bringing life to earth.
[1:36:24] You are manifesting Jesus Christ. You
[1:36:27] are the living manifest manifested word
[1:36:30] of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:32] You give God a voice.
[1:36:35] You give God a chance.
[1:36:38] You are the chance of God
[1:36:42] to manifest himself.
[1:36:51] I trust you're with me. Abraham was
[1:36:54] sitting there in the tent door watching.
[1:36:58] So all the people coming by
[1:37:01] said, "No, no, no.
[1:37:04] Are you bit low? Are you bit?
[1:37:08] Yes. Yes.
[1:37:10] He stood up, run to him.
[1:37:14] You know that brother Brandham said
[1:37:17] in the beginning, Abraham saw three.
[1:37:24] As he came closer,
[1:37:27] he understood it is the Lord.
[1:37:30] [Music]
[1:37:33] Hallelujah.
[1:37:35] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're
[1:37:38] there. You understand? When Abraham
[1:37:40] started walking
[1:37:42] to invite them, he didn't know it is the
[1:37:45] Lord.
[1:37:52] [Applause]
[1:37:57] Faith
[1:37:59] cometh by hearing.
[1:38:01] and hearing by the word of God.
[1:38:04] Amen.
[1:38:06] You you drama.
[1:38:11] Abraham is looking at the crowd.
[1:38:15] He said, "No,
[1:38:17] no, no."
[1:38:20] Suddenly his eyes fell on three.
[1:38:24] Oh,
[1:38:26] he he stood up and he is going towards
[1:38:29] them.
[1:38:30] And as he comes closer,
[1:38:35] it's the Lord.
[1:38:44] As you do
[1:38:46] what you can do,
[1:38:49] the Lord will reveal himself to you.

[1:39:22] Regardless who you are,
[1:39:27] as you do what you can do,
[1:39:31] he's unveiling himself.
[1:39:35] Oh, I trust I can encourage you.
[1:39:39] Don't let Satan,
[1:39:42] don't let the internet,
[1:39:44] don't let the world
[1:39:47] define you.
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:50] [Applause]
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:40:00] Okay, we Okay, don't let somebody else
[1:40:03] tell you who you are. All usually
[1:40:07] it's it's very funny today.
[1:40:10] If you come to Germany,
[1:40:12] you find many people,
[1:40:15] they have my skin
[1:40:18] and they they lay in the sun.
[1:40:21] They burn themsel
[1:40:25] just to look at you look.
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:29] [Applause]
[1:40:31] [Laughter]
[1:40:36] It's crazy actually.
[1:40:40] And over the next winter season they
[1:40:42] become white again.
[1:40:46] Then they spend a lot of money
[1:40:50] to come be a little bit more like you
[1:40:51] are.
[1:40:53] And here here I see people in Africa.
[1:40:56] They're giving out money to become
[1:40:59] white.
[1:41:02] [Laughter]
[1:41:12] Come on, church.
[1:41:14] Who tells you
[1:41:17] what you must be?
[1:41:22] Come on, church.
[1:41:25] Today we have a certain kind of ideology
[1:41:29] about
[1:41:32] what a woman should look like.
[1:41:36] Who is who is defining?
[1:41:40] Who's telling what is really? You
[1:41:42] understand this? And today many girls
[1:41:46] and I know it's also coming in Africa.
[1:41:50] Many young girls,
[1:41:52] they're trying to be like something that
[1:41:54] somebody pointed to them.
[1:41:59] They go through they go through
[1:42:00] operations
[1:42:03] to be to have a certain form.
[1:42:09] Who told you?
[1:42:11] Who told you?
[1:42:17] You know
[1:42:18] God said to to Eve, "Who told you that
[1:42:23] you are naked?
[1:42:26] Who told you that you are naked?
[1:42:30] Who is defining you?
[1:42:40] You understand that? And today today
[1:42:44] by this media
[1:42:48] there's a great pressure on people.
[1:42:55] Come on.
[1:42:57] The great man of the Bible,
[1:43:03] great David
[1:43:05] was a little fellow
[1:43:08] a mommy's boy.
[1:43:10] Remember when when Samuel came to look
[1:43:14] who will be a king? He saw what did he
[1:43:16] saw? The first one he looked like a real
[1:43:19] guy.
[1:43:21] Very simple. What did God say? It's not
[1:43:25] the outside that interested.
[1:43:28] It is the inside that
[1:43:33] I trust you say shot with me.
[1:43:37] It's beautiful.
[1:43:40] [Music]
[1:43:46] God needs you
[1:43:49] the way he made you.
[1:44:03] My we see that in the Bible in a couple
[1:44:04] of minutes
[1:44:07] follow that principle.
[1:44:09] Now here we saw we saw uh Jesus and the
[1:44:12] disciples of Emmas
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:17] and we saw we saw Abraham.
[1:44:21] Watch now. Watch.
[1:44:24] Abraham,
[1:44:26] he understand
[1:44:28] they are strangers.
[1:44:32] He stand up. He goes to them.
[1:44:36] And as he came closer,
[1:44:42] that's brother so and so.
[1:44:45] It's my lord.
[1:44:47] Oh, I came here
[1:44:50] to invite you.
[1:44:53] Would you come home with me?
[1:45:03] So simple.
[1:45:10] So, so simple.
[1:45:12] Every one of us could do that. Amen. Is
[1:45:16] that right?
[1:45:18] Every one of us could do.
[1:45:21] Is that correct? Watch what he's doing.
[1:45:24] As they are coming home, the Bible said
[1:45:28] he run to Sarah.
[1:45:31] Said Sarah.
[1:45:33] Stop. Stop murmuring.
[1:45:37] Tomorrow you can be said again.
[1:45:40] Come.
[1:45:42] Come quickly.
[1:45:45] Tomorrow you can be depressed again. Not
[1:45:48] quickly.
[1:45:51] Come quickly. Make something. Make
[1:45:53] something to eat.
[1:45:59] Oh my my my. You see, he never asked her
[1:46:03] to pray.
[1:46:05] He never asked her to fast.
[1:46:08] He never asked her to do magic.
[1:46:13] He just asked something of her
[1:46:18] that she was able to do.
[1:46:22] Very sorry.
[1:46:27] So God is not asking you
[1:46:31] for something you cannot do.
[1:46:34] [Applause]
[1:46:37] He's only asking you for something he
[1:46:40] know you can do.
[1:46:43] [Applause]
[1:46:53] Understand church.
[1:46:55] Understand something.
[1:46:58] What was Abraham doing?
[1:47:01] What was
[1:47:03] what was
[1:47:06] what was Jesus trying to do?
[1:47:09] Now you read with me Leviticus. Let's go
[1:47:12] to quick to Leviticus.
[1:47:17] Leviticus
[1:47:20] 19.
[1:47:23] Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. My my my.
[1:47:28] You're with me still in the drama?
[1:47:31] the drama of your own life.
[1:47:36] If I can ask you this, everyone has a
[1:47:39] story.
[1:47:43] We have all kinds of people here.
[1:47:46] All kinds of of of circumstances.
[1:47:50] People here that lost their husband or
[1:47:52] lost their wife.
[1:47:56] Maybe are grown orphan.
[1:48:00] Maybe we are handicapped
[1:48:04] all kinds of circumstances.
[1:48:07] Is that right? And many circumstances
[1:48:12] are dramatic
[1:48:20] and God
[1:48:22] loves drama.
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:31] Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:48:37] Let's go to Leviticus.
[1:48:39] [Music]
[1:48:41] Leviticus
[1:48:42] 19.
[1:48:44] We want to read verses 33, 34.
[1:48:53] Watch now.
[1:48:55] what God is telling to the Israelites,
[1:49:01] to his people.
[1:49:05] Okay, you with me?
[1:49:10] And this is not a condition.
[1:49:13] This is a duty.
[1:49:20] And if a stranger
[1:49:22] sold with thee in your land,
[1:49:27] You shall not vex him. You shall not vex
[1:49:30] him.
[1:49:32] 34.
[1:49:34] But the stranger that dwelleth with you
[1:49:37] shall be unto you as one born among you,
[1:49:40] and thou shalt love him as thyself. For
[1:49:44] ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
[1:49:47] I am the Lord your God.
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:50:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:11] You understand?
[1:50:13] Abraham knowing that
[1:50:16] his daily duty
[1:50:19] was to take care of strangers. His
[1:50:25] daily duty
[1:50:27] was to help strangers.
[1:50:30] That's why when Elohim came to Abraham,
[1:50:34] he has dressed himself
[1:50:37] and he looked like a stranger.
[1:50:43] Come on, church.
[1:50:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:50:50] Oh my my my my my
[1:50:56] Why
[1:50:57] was was was was Jesus
[1:51:01] acting so strange
[1:51:05] to the disciples
[1:51:08] playing stupid.
[1:51:12] So they said
[1:51:14] that's a stranger.
[1:51:19] and a stranger
[1:51:22] we have to entertain.
[1:51:29] You understand that? Come on, church.
[1:51:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:35] Hallelujah.
[1:51:38] [Music]
[1:51:40] You understand what he's doing?
[1:51:46] Oh my. I trust we can see that
[1:51:50] how God is creating circumstances
[1:51:54] to involve us
[1:51:58] into his plan.
[1:52:02] Because you know why? Because you are
[1:52:05] his partner.
[1:52:13] My You understand?
[1:52:16] And now
[1:52:18] he's speaking to them.
[1:52:21] And the virtue of remembrance
[1:52:25] brings all the things back to the
[1:52:27] memory.

[2:04:24] If they were married,
[2:04:26] they was wearing a certain sign like a
[2:04:28] wetle ring.
[2:04:32] But in those days, it was on the head.
[2:04:36] So everyone everyone could see
[2:04:39] that girl is not married yet.
[2:04:43] He said, "Let the first unmarried girl
[2:04:47] that comes out and I ask her for a
[2:04:50] drink."
[2:04:54] What?
[2:04:56] That's all.

[2:05:14] But I don't tell her
[2:05:22] what
[2:05:23] you mean. This is all.
[2:05:26] This is all of bright qualification.
[2:05:32] Giving water and feeding the camels.

[2:06:01] Are you from my church?
[2:06:04] Then you are in the bride.

[2:06:14] what church are you coming.
[2:06:17] He saw said she is a virgin.
[2:06:21] Is that right? Amen.
[2:06:27] And he said, "Can you give me a drink?"
[2:06:31] And then she said, "You know," she said,

[2:08:10] had kept her
[2:08:13] in the position of not being married
[2:08:15] yet.
[2:08:19] Amen. So Elaza said, Abraham said, I
[2:08:24] want you to pick up a virgin.
[2:08:30] Oh my my my my my. And you understand
[2:08:35] what she was doing
[2:08:37] to prove

[2:10:57] You know what Lot did?
[2:10:59] Come on. You know what Lot did? He was
[2:11:03] entertaining
[2:11:05] strangers.
[2:11:08] You remember Sodom?
[2:11:11] When the angels came to Sodom,
[2:11:13] he was the only one
[2:11:16] that said, "Come in. Come in. Come in.
[2:11:19] You are strangers.
[2:11:21] Come into my house.
[2:11:23] You know why he did that?
[2:11:26] Because it was his duty.
[2:11:31] Is it not simple?
[2:11:33] [Music]
[2:11:36] Come on, church.
[2:11:42] Give me two or three 10 minutes.
[2:11:48] Sorry.
[2:11:56] Now he said come we invite you because
[2:12:02] God has told us because we our fathers
[2:12:06] were strangers.
[2:12:08] We know how it is to be strangers.
[2:12:12] Are we not here? We are strangers and
[2:12:15] pilgrims.
[2:12:18] So and and they said you know stranger
[2:12:23] our forefathers
[2:12:25] there were strangers in Egypt and God
[2:12:27] told him that they should host
[2:12:30] strangers.
[2:12:32] This is the only thing that we can do.
[2:12:34] We have no much money. We have not a
[2:12:37] church to bring you
[2:12:39] but we can invite you.
[2:12:42] Oh, okay. Jesus said finally. Okay.
[2:12:46] Okay. It's nice. Thank you.
[2:12:52] Brother Brandham is telling the story.
[2:12:55] These two Cleopas and his friends was
[2:12:58] inviting Jesus in.
[2:13:02] And normally
[2:13:05] the one that is inviting
[2:13:07] is sitting in himself at the head of the
[2:13:10] table.
[2:13:12] But Jesus who is invited
[2:13:17] straight away
[2:13:19] takes the lead.
[2:13:24] Yes. When do you do your duty
[2:13:28] automatically
[2:13:31] he takes control of your life.
[2:13:38] You understand that?
[2:13:41] And he was sitting at the head of the
[2:13:43] table
[2:13:46] and Cleopa said to his
[2:13:50] strange
[2:13:58] we invited him.
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:09] God loves drama.
[2:14:21] Now the the the owner of the inn is
[2:14:25] coming with bread.
[2:14:29] He's coming with bread.
[2:14:31] Puts it on the table, you know. And
[2:14:35] Cleopas,
[2:14:36] he was the oldest.
[2:14:38] Is that okay? Let me let me let me at
[2:14:41] least pray.
[2:14:43] He just want to take the bread.
[2:14:46] Jesus takes the bread.
[2:14:50] They look at him and say,
[2:14:54] "Don't
[2:14:56] don't be surprised
[2:14:58] that he takes control of your life."
[2:15:04] If you
[2:15:06] are just doing what you can do,
[2:15:11] don't be surprised
[2:15:13] when he takes full control of your life
[2:15:19] who want him this evening to have full
[2:15:22] control of your life.
[2:15:24] Then you do what you can do. You do your
[2:15:28] normal duties.
[2:15:34] Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:15:37] They looked and said,
[2:15:40] "Do you understand that?"
[2:15:43] He said, "No."
[2:15:44] And he takes the bread.
[2:15:47] He blesses the bread. And I and I
[2:15:51] believe those disciples when they
[2:15:54] prayed, they was watching and praying.
[2:16:05] So he takes the bread,
[2:16:07] he blesses the bread,
[2:16:10] he breaks the bread,
[2:16:14] [Applause]
[2:16:16] their eyes is open.
[2:16:19] Revelation strikes them.
[2:16:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Revelation
[2:16:25] strikes you
[2:16:27] as you allow him to have control in your
[2:16:30] life.
[2:16:33] [Music]
[2:16:35] Hallelujah. Don't you love the Bible
[2:16:37] stories?
[2:16:39] This is real life stories.
[2:16:42] This is real life stories.
[2:16:48] Hallelujah.
[2:16:51] And they walk back.
[2:16:54] They have a testimony.
[2:16:56] He is alive.
[2:16:59] They went to Mary Magdalene.
[2:17:02] Said, "Sorry, Mary.
[2:17:04] We didn't understood what you were
[2:17:05] saying.
[2:17:07] We thought it's a wrong doctrine."
[2:17:10] But no, he is alive. He is risen.
[2:17:14] [Applause]
[2:17:18] So simple.
[2:17:23] 5 minutes.
[2:17:25] We close at We close at six. Is it okay?
[2:17:28] Is it still okay?
[2:17:35] Watch.
[2:17:38] Watch.
[2:17:40] Now it becomes serious.
[2:17:43] Now it becomes very serious.
[2:17:58] There was a prophet
[2:18:02] I think his name was Elijah
[2:18:06] in circumstances
[2:18:09] had made
[2:18:11] the water to run out
[2:18:15] and the food didn't
[2:18:21] You with me?
[2:18:24] Now it becomes serious.
[2:18:29] Now Elijah is looking
[2:18:32] to do now.
[2:18:34] You know what God is telling him?
[2:18:36] Go to Sarapat.
[2:18:38] Go to the village of Saripat.
[2:18:44] You with me?
[2:18:47] God said, "I have commanded
[2:18:51] a widow woman
[2:18:55] to sustain thee."
[2:19:04] Can I tell you something?
[2:19:07] God needs widows.
[2:19:21] God needs widows in his drama.
[2:19:24] [Music]
[2:19:33] Is it amazing
[2:19:35] that God said, "I have commanded a widow
[2:19:38] woman."
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:41] And she did know nothing about it.
[2:19:50] We are closing with this.
[2:19:54] How did God command?
[2:19:58] He allowed circumstances in her life.
[2:20:06] He allowed circumstances in her life.
[2:20:14] Now, her husband had died.
[2:20:17] [Applause]
[2:20:21] Keep in mind
[2:20:23] There is a duty
[2:20:26] for Israel
[2:20:30] and that widow woman knows that.
[2:20:33] [Music]
[2:20:41] Come on.
[2:20:45] What
[2:20:49] God commanded that widow woman
[2:20:52] and never told her.
[2:21:01] So God can command you
[2:21:05] to have purpose
[2:21:08] and never tell you.
[2:21:23] We are closing.
[2:21:26] As Elijah
[2:21:29] came to that Sarah,
[2:21:32] he saw a woman outside.
[2:21:35] If she would be married,
[2:21:38] she would not be outside.
[2:21:45] But because now she was a widow woman,
[2:21:48] she had to take care of her body.
[2:21:52] And remember
[2:21:54] here she was just doing and
[2:21:57] finding something for the last meal.
[2:22:03] Elijah comes
[2:22:05] and what is he saying? She looked at him
[2:22:09] and she understood
[2:22:11] that he is a stranger.
[2:22:16] He's not from this village.
[2:22:19] When he said, "Give me a drink,"
[2:22:23] it was a duty for her.
[2:22:30] You get that? And as she wanted to
[2:22:33] follow that duty,
[2:22:36] he said, "And not only
[2:22:39] make me also something."
[2:22:43] She said, "I have nothing."
[2:22:45] He said the meal if you just follow your
[2:22:48] duty.
[2:22:54] If you just do what you can do
[2:22:58] and I will do what you cannot do.
[2:23:03] You understand that?
[2:23:05] You understand? You understand the
[2:23:07] principle.
[2:23:13] We close with Hebrews
[2:23:17] 13.
[2:23:27] Hebrews 13.
[2:23:30] Can you bring that up?
[2:23:33] As we said this morning,
[2:23:36] Hebrews 13
[2:23:38] doesn't stand alone.
[2:23:40] [Music]
[2:23:45] Let's go to Hebrews 13:1.
[2:23:54] Let brotherly love continue.
[2:24:03] That's not a condition.
[2:24:07] That's a duty.
[2:24:11] Watch Paul.
[2:24:13] Verse two.
[2:24:21] Now, is that not amazing?
[2:24:27] What makes him Jesus Christ? is the same
[2:24:29] today.
[2:24:33] What did Paul say?
[2:24:36] Be not forgetful to entertain strangers,
[2:24:40] for thereby some have entertained angels
[2:24:43] unaware.
[2:24:50] Let's go to verse three. Remember them
[2:24:54] that are in bonds as bonds with them,
[2:24:56] and them which suffer adversity as being
[2:24:59] yourselves also in the body.
[2:25:11] Verse
[2:25:16] [Music]
[2:25:18] four,
[2:25:19] marriage is honorable in all and the bad
[2:25:22] be undefiled, but whom mongers and our
[2:25:24] daughters God will judge.
[2:25:31] Let your let let your conversation be
[2:25:33] without co in this and be content with
[2:25:36] such things as you have. For he said, "I
[2:25:38] will never leave neither forsakes thee.
[2:25:47] [Music]
[2:25:56] I want you I want you to stop quickly
[2:25:58] here.
[2:25:59] This is all things
[2:26:03] we easily can do.
[2:26:14] Let's go to let's go to verse seven
[2:26:18] now. Remember them which have the rule
[2:26:22] over you, who have spoken unto you the
[2:26:25] word of God, whose face follow
[2:26:27] considering the end of their
[2:26:29] conversation.
[2:26:45] Now the next verse,
[2:26:47] [Music]
[2:26:49] we want to read it together.
[2:26:52] Jesus Christ,
[2:26:54] the same yesterday
[2:26:57] and today
[2:26:59] and forever.
[2:27:04] [Applause]
[2:27:08] God bless you.
[2:27:10] [Applause]
[2:27:13] Hallelujah.
[2:27:17] Let us stand together and
[2:27:25] let's just
[2:27:27] just tell him that we love him.
[2:27:34] Do you know the song? There are no words
[2:27:36] to tell you how I love you.
[2:27:40] No words to tell you how I love you.
[2:27:46] Okay, we sing it on the other side then
[2:27:48] together.
[2:27:51] Amen. Just let's pray together.
[2:27:54] And why don't you tell him?
[2:27:59] [Music]
[2:28:03] Hallelujah. We have so many reasons.
[2:28:08] 10,000 reasons
[2:28:11] to thank him for.
[2:28:16] What has he done for us?
[2:28:19] How many times he has healed us?
[2:28:22] How many times he has comforted us?
[2:28:25] How many times he has revealed himself?
[2:28:29] How many times he has protected us?
[2:28:32] How many times
[2:28:34] [Music]
[2:28:36] so much to thank him for.
[2:28:41] Let's just use this few minutes
[2:28:45] personally. You

[2:30:17] and we can say this day this scripture
[2:30:22] is fulfilled. Father, we love you.

[2:30:35] not to do the impossible.

[2:30:46] Hallelujah.
[2:30:49] So you can be Jesus Christ
[2:30:52] the same today.

[2:43:50] Oh redeemed,
