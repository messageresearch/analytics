that's on 15th we shall be inviting other papers new pastors and the pastors around us we shall be expecting about 300 plus people around and now we need to prepare a meal for all the people praise the name of Allah and so it is good when people visit you you feed them so I'm requesting to give your contributions for that meeting with the male to brother Peter aula I was asking him in the course of the week and then he said they are not received anything yeah so two weeks which even we need to raise one and a half million Shillings I know we have not paid school fees for children some of us the month has come to an end so the landlord is knocking but the things of God told Elijah go to that Widow and the Widow Was preparing the last meal prepare it for me first now if she was to eat that last meal alone different churches of the denominations and so yesterday we collected quite a number of them about three groups over 100 people there by then we baptized 96 people in number two months and then I just remembered at that time when I was still there yesterday I I shared the photographs now now I sent the photographs on the WhatsApp of the church and then I think it was just I think about after certain minutes and I want to appreciate that and I remember yesterday we have churches we've opened up to the message in Western Uganda at the beginning of the year it has been sending different people to go there so there's a particular pasta who has got now the burden to reach out to different churches foreign and then now when I was asking him how much money it would need to transport this before baptism it was 230 000. and then your brother in the time of need sent two hundred thousand organization so I just got all that money and sent it to the pastor who is ministering there that you can baptize the people today so this is really what happens you know you spend here you spend here but you're not spending in vain because if we can recognize that whatever we have we are giving of it of the Lord and so if I receive it and they return it back then you're multiplying what you're going through praise the name of Allah I just encourage you to learn how to give up learn how to give giving your life you have given your life to Christ but what about what you have you learn how to put back into the Kingdom so I was really very happy by what brother Nassau did and it excited praise the name of Allah now this morning our sister Francis she's the wife of brother Wilson Italian her father passed away at Milagro hospital so now they are we shall get the burial arrangements and would really call upon support to the family and even those who were able to travel for the burial when we get the right date District the value may be in the symbol of the district

one on water baptism it shows baptism in the name of Jesus Christ showing you the scriptures and the the historical books then there is also baptism by imagine how it was done in much water and we

of eternal life make yourself manifested in us and help us to be ready Lord we have to disrupture that's coming anytime we love you Lord and we thank you and bless our hearts all together with all the needs of your children the name of the Lord Jesus let us go to Matthew chapter 25 yeah Matthew 25 Matthew we are reading from verse 1 to verse 10. the scripture says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom foreign took their lambs and took no oil with them foreign but the wines took all in their vessels with their lamps UPA much [Music] while the bridegroom Target they all slumbered and slept foreign and at midnight there was a crime made behold the bridegroom Comics going out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and they've and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out foreign foreign foreign and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were already went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut up again yeah foreign so today we want to share on the token of the Third Exodus the token of the sad Exodus now in the message of the hour brother Branham identifies three exoduses and the first Exodus was The Exodus which was led by Moses when they were leaving the land of Egypt to the land of the promise and in that Exodus before they left the land of Egypt God gave them a token which they had to use in order to go to the land of the promise then again there was the second Exodus and that Exodus was led by the Lord Jesus Christ where he was leading the Jews you know from the religious systems of the day he told the baptism of the holy spirit so then they are God also gave them a token and now we are in the Third Exodus is God is calling a bride out of the denomination system and as he calls the bride out of the denominational system he gives them his very life and the life of Christ is the token today the Life of Christ is the token of this Exodus the life of Jesus Christ is the token of the Third Exodus and now this life of Jesus Christ to go into the Rapture this life of Jesus Christ we will change our bodies now we see here in the scriptures when we go to Exodus chapter three and we look at the first Exodus in Exodus chapter 3 and then verse the scripture says now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of median and he led the Flop to the back side of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even Hebron says whatever and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in the flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush bound with fire and the Bush was not consummed Saka Nola and Moses said I'll now turn aside and see this great sign why the bush is not banned and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I okay and he said don't not deny either put off thy shoes from of thy feet for the place where on those standeth is Holy grounded [Music] moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God watch musan [Music] Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows um and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey and to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the heavites and the jebusites City a nature now they are for Behold The Crying of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression where with the Egyptians or president foreign that thou must bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt Allah foreign and [Music] that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt US city and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be that amen praise the name of our Lord I mean that was the first Exodus when God was calling the children of Israel from Egypt to the land of promise foreign and you know like Moses was grazing the animals on that here I mean you maybe was the only person grazing in that place and then he started wondering I've not liten a candle yeah I've not put any fire anywhere then who is this person who can light this thing so it took his interest and then he saw the fire burning but then the the bush is not consumed then he wondered and you see God was taking drawing his attention and many times also God wants to draw our attention God wants to do our attention to him and then now when Moses reached there so God himself came down and then he started speaking to Moses and then we see that it was the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel out of Egypt even from through the Wilderness up to the land of the promise so God himself come down praise the name of our Lord he came down as the angel of the convenience praise the name of the Lord he came down to lead The Exodus and then we see here that God manifested himself tomorrow you know there are some things you hear and then you start wondering why are this happening praise the name of our Lord so much immorality so much more you know wickedness even things you wouldn't want to imagine or things you wouldn't speak about praise the name of Allah like just in the course of this week you know there is a person who believed the message from one of the churches I've seen brother malavia welcome but in all Uganda you're welcome to be with us praise the name of our Lord so now what happened these people are coming for the services we have every every Thursday and so even this sister came and then she wanted to talk to me and then now when she was talking you know she was you know saying things which she has been subjected to yeah and you know you wouldn't want to believe something but you can see how immoral people can be until the husband start sodomizing his wife and then she said that you know then when she dreamed when the husband was doing this kind of thing she went and she was standing up and all the human race was running out yeah foreign lot of wickedness until everything even at places of work truth is not really wanted they want dubious things you know they want things of cheating and then you find that your place becomes like Sodom and Gomorrah like a lot was in Sodom and Gomorrah and then the scripture says that the heart of Lords was fixed by what he saw and by what he had and you see at places of work you see what people do you hear what people say and then you find the environment is no longer good to living as a Christian everything thing is being dubious even the one who is meant to monitor is dubious you know everything no clear line they said this then they do something different it is another condition of bondage in Egypt and now we see the spiritual conditions so that is taking place it may be a bondage at your home it may be a bondage at a place look what the diseases you know that are getting a hold of the people look what the religious systems how corrupt it has become bondage in every condition so God sends another Exodus in our time praise the name of Allah and then verse the scripture says and the Lord spoken to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of mass it shall be the first month of the year to you foreign foreign let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamp foreign foreign and you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening foreign of the houses wherein you shall eat it foreign and they shall eat the Flesh in that night and roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it not a vitro nor a sudden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the patiness thereof on Amazon and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire engine and that shall you eat it with your loins guarded your shoes on your feet and your stuff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover foreign of Egypt both man and Beast and against all gods of Egypt I will execute judgment for I am the Lord and the blood shall be unto for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt foreign foreign you shall sacrifice it so there were four days of checking the the lamp is perfect praise the name of Allah and then we see also our Lord Jesus Christ the scripture tells us in First Corinthians chapter 5 and then we read in verse 7 he says Purge out there for the old living that you may be a new lamp as you are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us is a so Christ is our past of alarm so when they were sacrificing that lamb in Exodus chapter 12. they were showing the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is our Passover Lamb Christian here the lamb was required to be without any blame it was not the sinner it was not the people but the people were told take the lamb check the sacrifice praise the name of Allah and then it was the sacrifice that was checked but the worshiper was required to take the perfect animals perfect sacrifice foreign Christ became our sins and then we take the righteousness of God by receiving our Lord Jesus Christ and this is what the token really does hear the talking was for you to apply the blood of a perfect sacrifice and that's what the Lord wanted them to do apply the blood and even now we need to apply the blood but the blood is not the chemistry because out of the blood comes the life you know the Bible tells us when we got the Book of Leviticus chapter 17. and then we read in verse 11. for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that makes a tournament for the soul Leviticus 17 11. Yama um praise the name of our Lord he says I have given you the blood upon the altar praise the name of Allah upon the altar of your heart I have given you the blood and out of the blood comes the light so when you apply the Life of Christ I've turned your heart then the Judgment passes away from you praise the name of Allah you know produces the life so now physically they were applying the blood but spiritually the life was the one which was going uh on the day of Pentecost the blood came back upon the worshiper and then you know the token was applied upon their lives and then we see her that in the Old Testament they applied the blood on the doorsteps you know they put the blood and when the angel was passing back and he saw the blood there was no destruction in that house and it's also the same thing also now we need to apply the blood Upon Our Hearts praise the name of our Lord we need to apply the blood upon your house and maybe you are living in a community praise the name of our Lord you know most of our communities we live in they have different names and then you go to a village around here yeah and then they call it then you know okutamira is the order of the day there what a guarantee drunk drunkenness that is the spirit that lures then you go to another Village they also have another funny name you know and then they have names of ghosts or names of you know funny things names of murderers you know there is another Village somewhere in kamory I'm just forgetting the name but as you go to namuela and they said that village with the Witchcraft very famous for that but she didn't always but even if you come from that Village and you applied the blood of Jesus Christ upon your heart God will protect you from those things even us now in the end time the devil has released these gates of hell but you need to apply the blood of Jesus Christ and you'll be safe and secure from and then he says by holding to the word of God foreign Psalms 119 and then verse 9 Academy the scripture says shall a young man cleanse his way why because there's a lot of that there is a lot of immorality there is a lot of evil so he says how are you going to cleanse your way you know when the Bible asks a question it gives the answer and it says by taking heed there to according to your words [Music] you just need the blood of Jesus apply the blood of Jesus at your place of work apply the blood of Jesus at the place of your studies apply the blood of Jesus in your house apply the blood of Jesus you know there are some places where there are people who don't want others to developers you know when you start digging the foundation they start throwing their witchcraft apply the blood of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord then there are some families maybe they are core wives um foreign apply the blood of Jesus Christ the name of Allah you know so the blood is our protection praise the name of our Lord how do you apply the blood of Jesus Christ by the word of God and the word of prayer you committed to the Lord you call upon the name of the Lord you are applying the blood of Jesus and when you apply the blood of Jesus you will be protected from all the plans of Satan from all the schemes even from people who are thinking evil things against us but they know they cannot do anything again speaking against you so they applied the blood on their doorsteps but then that was chemistry now we see that in the first exercise the animal was the one the sacrifice woman which was meant to be perfect and we see that our Lord Jesus Christ fulfilled all these shadows and when our Lord was going to be crucified he had to be found without any blame praise the name of Allah they brought him to the courts of the high priest in the cons of the sanhedrine and then now they started bringing all false accusations and then they took him to Pilots when they took him to pilots and then they took him to Herod when they took him to Heroes talking back to Pirates and then the wife of pirate told him do nothing to that righteousness and then pirate started washing his heart why Christ Our sacrifice was proved perfect we are not served by the blood of the son of Mary is the name of Allah we are not served by the blood of a Jew we are not served by the blood of a man but the Bible tells us in Acts chapter 20 and then verse 28 praise the name of our Lord Acts chapter 20 and verse 28. take it therefore unto yourselves and and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feeding the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood um foreign the prostitute she was given a token a Scarlet you know a cloth which was red and then she put it on her window yeah for her protection and even now we need the token they're talking that he gives us at this time and the token that is giving us in this Third Exodus is the life of Jesus Christ no longer I that leave us but it's the Lord now if it is the Lord living in you he will protect you from all evil he will protect you from all sins he'll protect you from all destruction it's no longer you that's living but it's the life of God himself and when we come to church we need to desire the life of God you hated that person for 10 years until when they speak about that person you just hate to hear about his name remove that Spirit of hatred that Spirit of hatred is destructive praise the name of our Lord we need to get away from that praise the name of our Lord now in the message the Third Exodus he says I'm going to read in different paragraphs now in paragraph 297 297. he says we are in an exodus and living and actually then he says yakova oh my friends my brothers both present and that will hear the tips let me as your brother and citizen of the kingdom of God then he says come out in this Exodus for that's that's for all that will be left behind will bear The Mark of the Beast come out of Babylon move them Babylonia come out of this confusion come out of this system and serve the Living God no so he's telling us about the Third Exodus is coming out of Babylon coming out of confusion coming out of religion now in paragraph 299 baby paragraph 299 he says the first Exodus what did he do yeah he brought them out of a natural land to a natural land that's what we have been seeing he brought them out of Egypt and then he took them the land of the promise he brought them out of a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost you know when Jesus came praise the name of our Lord they had religions they already settled in their land but they were under bondage in the land of promise can you imagine foreign baptism of the Holy Spirit now he is bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Spirit right into the Eternal land of the Millennium and the great Hereafter the same Peter of Fire by the same anointed the same God doing the same thing and the same word that declared the first one has declared the second one the same nothing has declared the third one and we see here it Among Us come out of this chaos come to the Living God come to the world and the Word was made flesh and breasts the holy spirit in the form of a pillow fire god coming down in manifestation brought out the first Exodus and back in brought Israel out of Egypt that was the first Exodus the second Exodus was Christ bringing the church out of Judaism and then the Third Exodus is when the same Pillar of Fire takes the bride from the church out of the spiritual and the spiritual out of the spirit the spiritual out of the church rather which is led by our Lord Jesus Christ the Bible tells us in Matthew chapter 1 and then in verse 21. Matthew chapter 1 verse 21 to verse 25. he says and she shall bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus for He Shall Serve his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying foreign shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted God With Us then Joseph being raised from this sleep did as the angel of the Lord had Biden him and took unto him his wife and you are not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and called his name Jesus so the yamamanya okutzala omana yes praise the name of Allah so now we see her that the Lord Jesus Christ is born to save us sins and the Bible says his name Shall be Called Emmanuel God With Us Praise the name of Allah when we go to Luke Chapter 2 and then verse 10. Luke chapter 10 verse 10. and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy we shall be to all people for unto is Born This Day in the city of David as Savior which is Christ the lord foreign so now the Bible says in John chapter 7. and then verse 37 in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink yes he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his bury shall flow rivers of Living Water [Music] but this spoke he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified foreign the Holy Spirit was not given because Jesus had not yet died and resurrected but when the Lord died and resurrected then the life that was in Jesus comes back on the day of Pentecost and when that life comes on the day of Pentecost the saints were baptized they received the baptism of the holy spirit so the baptism of the now let us go to Luke chapter 3 oxide and then we read in verse 15. up to verse 16. and as the people are in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of John whether he were the Christ or not John answered saying unto them I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I cometh I am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire is a foreign [Music] and then verse 4. praise the name of our Lord he says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which says he you've heard of me foreign but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth praise the name of Allah so the baptism of the Holy Spirit broken of the second Exodus it is an evidence that God has received your face you have come out of sin into his righteousness so he gives you his own Spirit to prove that he has accepted you yeah quick it is it's no longer you that lives but it is Christ that lives so now the token of the second Exodus was the baptism of the Holy Spirit praise the name of Allah and every person that receives Jesus Christ as his personal savior needs to be baptized with the baptism of the Holy Spirit you need to allow that life that was in the and that life in the blood of Jesus is the spirit of God the holy spirit is the spirit of Christ the holy spirit is the spirit of God so you need to allow the life that was in the in the blood of Jesus Christ when you hear the word of God that word of God that you hear at the beginning and you believe that word then you are Justified and it is the word justifying yes the spirit of God justifying the blood of Christ justifying you the same thing Hebrews chapter 12. foreign 24.99 and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blue calling that speakers better things than that of Abel yes so the Bible says the blood of Jesus speaks better now in the message praise the name of our Lord he says now we find also in the Hebrews Hebrews and verse 24. that the New Testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is came the spirit of Christ so then it is the spirit of Christ that is bringing conviction to take you from this Evil Soul to take you from this evil action to take you from this weakness this is the same thing so then the Holy Spirit starts working Upon Our Lives when we believe the Lord Jesus Christ so the spirit of God is not far from you he has already started walking upon your life the moment you are you raised your heart oh Lord I accept you as my personal assistant the spirit of God started working upon you yeah praise the name of our Lord so then he says and if the Bloods you know if the blood or Messiah speaks better things then the voice of the blood is the word and then he says the voice of the blood is the holy spirit now what is the difference it is the same thing but you need to grow up in it obedience total obedience to the world surrender to the blood and then the Holy Spirit take over all your life it's not difficult to apply the token if you have accepted the Lord Jesus as your personal savior you just need to continue Lord I surrender all myself Lord I yield all myself and you know the more you surrender it's the more you are changed [Music] if you do it foreign gumbo and so as you hear otherwise as you read the words you open the word then the holy spirit will give you the ability to fulfill that word and the time will reach that you do things unconsciously praise the name of our Lord you do things unconscious because it is part of you praise the name of Allah you and the word has become one so then you become the manifestation of the word that you believe praise the name of our Lord so then in paragraph 168 show where the blood speaks it speaks better things in the Old Testament the blood spoke of guilt of foreign he has given unto us the Bible says things every interview now through the blood of Jesus Christ he has given us all things how through the Life of Christ and the life of Christ is the life of God praise the name of our Lord Zoe Zoe God's own life it's by the being of God the being of God created everything that we see the being of God created us Zoe Zoe created us we were formed by God we were created by God so anything that we have need of God is right before us when we receive Christ we receive whatever we have needed and then you say Lord this is Lord this is my desire Lord guide me out when you accept the Lord Jesus as your personal savior don't stop at that put a personal relationship with him and that relationship you have with Christ will bring down his life to be manifested in your life and that should be your desire if today I have failed in this area let

the message praise the name of our Lord message talking of 1964 February he says and tonight God requires the baptism of the Holy Ghost Aga that we have been identified in the resurrection of Jesus Christ there is nothing short of it the Bible teaches it rain [Music] [Music] and you know brother used to be and that heisup is a common weight it is stood for Faith so faith is common don't think this thing is complicated yes do you think it's easy then you don't know where to find it [Music] you don't know what you're looking for the Holy Ghost was given on the day of Pentecost was given a day of Pentecost he has never gone back are you getting it he has never gone back after the only because it's too close the word when is preached it's the Holy Ghost speaking so how far is the Holy Ghost just received crazy oh man united yeah the problem we have [Music] the question is the Life of Christ you know people are looking for emotions the Holy Ghost Came Upon me I failed today there was a place I went to anyone telling me the other brother received the Holy Ghost the whole time was saying Jesus Jesus even going to the tax even going home we are trying that's not what it is the life of Jesus Christ it's the life of Jesus Christ don't look for signs of emotions but look for the life of Jesus Christ now in the message the lamp and the dove um foreign I rejoice in the spirit that has nothing to do with it it's not you rejoicing in the spirit is it the baptism of the Holy Ghost that spot on the congregation it is a new bus a change of the heart that changes in mind from a dying being to a resurrected Immortal Son of God taking his place on the seat of the believer's heart it is a nature change your nature you love sin foreign is is not true that the Bible said the rain falls on the Justice The Sun Shines on the just and the unjust you take a wheat field and the little heads are turning over here it's a drought they all distinct weeds of divine divine foreign it's a vision I saw us and they were all needing rain and when the showers came the little it rinsed up its head and rejoiced and the stick with raised up it said and rejoice and the creeper raised it said and rejoice they were just as proud to get the rain as the rest of them but brother one of them was bearing the fruit of the wheat and the other was bearing the fruit of all that goes with it but unless the fruit of the spirit with the God's word you are just good and outward demonstration and we today are relying so much on outward emotions and demonstrations thank you when it comes a genuine pure Born Again holy ghosts LED life to prove what you are now that is right my dear brother and sister unless there is fruit and the fruit of the spirit is not an outward demonstration it is an inward work of Grace Joy the life that you live is it the life of Jesus Christ now let us go to the Third Exodus as I try to see how we can wind up now in Revelations chapter 18. Revelation chapter 18 and then verse 1 to verse 5. and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory following Nancy and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is falling is falling and it's become the habitation of devils and the whole of ever false Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of our fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are worked Rich through the abundancy of her Delicacies foreign foreign foreign foreign for her sins have reached unto heaven and God has remembered her iniquities praise the name of our Lord so the Third Exodus which we are in calls out of Babylon and now it is a mystery Babylon means confusion and now this Babylon is a religious system the union of religions it's a call to come out of your denomination it's a call to come out of your religion in the time we are living in we are living in the Rhodesian Church age an age where they have rejected Christ knock [Music] that Christ is outside of the church you know when when you are when you are knocking on the door where do you stand you stand outside so Christ is already outside and now he's calling in the videos praise the name of our Lord come and I dine with you so it is the Third Exodus he's calling people out of denomination come out of that confusion come out of the Union of churches come out of the Union of religious systems come out of the Union of councils of churches and we see the time we're leaving it you see where all denominations all religious systems are coming together the nomination is coming on worship says worships an image of something else and then they're all coming together and then the other one worships with the judges you know witchcraft is coming on the same table then this one says and they are all being identified together and you see the scripture sayings that he will send his angels and then they will get the tears together so the religion organization the union of religions that are being bound together praise the name of Allah but now he's calling the electronics come out of her my people and don't partake of her sins for our sins have reached and the Judgment has already been pronounced so even in this sad Exodus Christ himself comes down as the pillar of fire to lead us praise the name of our Lord Christ comes down as a pill of fire and then he leads us in our generation was faster identified with with brother Branham and then God took brother Branham off the scene and when brother Branham was preaching and [Applause] the messages of the Lord we still have the same voice of God we still have the same Holy Spirit that's leading in this Exodus this Exodus is not being led by a man it is that come down praise the name of our Lord Praise himself come down now when we got back to Matthew chapter 25 where we read at the beginning the Bible says There Were Ten virgins and when they had all Slumbers in March 25 7 from verse six verses and at the midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh going out to meet him and we have heard this cry okay by the message of the hour all over back up the bridegroom comes now these virgins they had all left Egypt because they are virgins they are pure they are not adulterated praise the name of Allah but then these other five they had enough oil the others didn't have enough and that's where the difference is do you have enough oil to help you go through foreign foreign together and when it is expanding it needed a new bottle to expand with it okay okay so in the old bottom praise the name of Allah the bottles where they are vessels and what is the vessel now you and me we are the vessels so have oil In Your Vessel of God he wants to dwell in you he wants to abide in it and then the Bible says they went with their lamps what are lamps according to the scriptures Psalms 119 verse 105. Psalms 119 and then verse 105. it says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path is so they went with their vessels but you need that lamp for the lamp to work it needed to get oil from the vessels so you need to receive the words you go with the word but you need the oil to make the word Living Praise the name of Allah to make the word alive
