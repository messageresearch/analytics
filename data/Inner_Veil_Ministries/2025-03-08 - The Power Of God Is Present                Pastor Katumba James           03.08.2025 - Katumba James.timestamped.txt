[28:52] of the word into your hands and the

[29:00] we have and encourage every one of us.
[29:03] Bless us in such a special
[29:06] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[29:09] Amen. Amen.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Let us go to Luke chapter 5.
[29:24] We reading from verse 16 to verse 26
[29:28] is
[29:28] &gt;&gt; some story
[29:33] Luke 5
[29:40] verse 16.
[29:42] and he withdrew himself into the
[29:44] wilderness and prayed.
[29:53] And it came to pass on a certain day as
[29:56] he was teaching that there were
[29:58] Pharisees and doctors of law sitting by
[30:01] which were come out of every town of
[30:04] Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem, and the
[30:07] power of the Lord was present to him.
[30:34] And behold, men brought in a bed, in a
[30:37] bed a man which was taken with pulsy,
[30:40] and They sought means to bring him in
[30:44] and lay him before him. And when they
[30:46] could not find by what way they might
[30:49] bring him in because of the multitude,
[30:52] they went upon the housetop and let him
[30:56] through the tiring with his coach into
[30:59] the midst before Jesus. And when he saw
[31:02] their faith, he said unto him, "Man, thy
[31:05] sins are forgiven.
[31:09] Neverchang.
[31:49] And the scriers and the Pharisees began
[31:51] to reason, saying, "Who is this which
[31:53] speaketh blasphemies? For who can
[31:56] forgive sins but God alone?" But when
[31:59] Jesus perceived their thoughts, he
[32:01] answering said unto them, "What reason
[32:04] ye in your hearts? What is easier to
[32:08] say, "Thy sins be forgiven
[32:11] thee," or to say, "Rise up and walk?
[32:46] But that you may know that the Son of
[32:48] Man has power upon earth to forgive
[32:52] sins, he said to the sick of
[32:55] I say unto thee, arise, and take up thy
[32:59] coach, and go in thine house.
[33:18] And immediately arose up before them and
[33:21] took up the took and took up that where
[33:25] on he lay and departed to his own house
[33:27] glorifying God. And they were all amazed
[33:30] and they glorified God and were filled
[33:33] with fear saying we have seen strange
[33:35] things today.
[33:58] May God sing of his word. You may be
[34:01] seated.
[34:02] I want us to pick a text from verse 17
[34:08] which says the power of God was present
[34:10] to heal them.
[34:14] So I want to talk about the power of God
[34:17] is present.
[34:21] Praise the name of our Lord. The power
[34:23] of God is present.
[34:26] And you know Satan many times
[34:30] he always wants to put things of God to
[34:33] be to look like they are far away from
[34:35] us.
[34:38] So when you think about God
[34:41] you always think is there in heaven
[34:44] but here is not here with me.
[34:47] So everything
[34:49] the devil wants us to post them to be
[34:51] far away from us.
[34:55] He he wants us to believe
[34:58] that there is no presence of God with
[35:00] us.
[35:02] He wants us to think there is no God in
[35:06] me or there's no God about me
[35:10] and so you put it far away
[35:13] you know like now
[35:17] somebody when he hears about the
[35:18] ministry of brother Brana
[35:21] then he said oh God I wish I was there.
[35:25] I wish I was there at the brana
[35:28] and then I go before brother
[35:31] and then he discerns me.
[35:33] Oh, this is what you want. I wish I had
[35:36] also that kind of feeling calm down
[35:40] I don't know what to do. But the Bible
[35:42] say don't say that
[35:46] praise the name of our lord you know
[35:48] don't say who will go to heaven
[35:54] to bring him down because you had he
[35:56] ascended into the heaven
[35:59] or who will go to hell
[36:02] to bring him from hell because you knew
[36:04] he was buried and
[36:07] he says the word is near you.
[36:11] The word is in your heart,
[36:13] even in your mouth.
[36:16] How close God is.
[36:19] Praise the name of our Lord. It says the
[36:21] word of faith.
[36:24] You know, it's just believing it.
[36:27] And then you see that God
[36:30] manifest himself
[36:33] that is present.
[36:35] Praise the name of our Lord. So then
[36:37] like for example
[36:39] you know when you are conscious about
[36:41] the presence of God
[36:44] you are not going to think something
[36:46] wrong.
[36:48] When you are conscious about the
[36:49] presence of God
[36:51] you're not going to do things which are
[36:53] wrong
[36:54] you know because you want to be in that
[36:56] kind of continuous fellowship.
[37:01] Praise the name of our Lord. And this is
[37:03] what happens in our lives.
[37:06] You know that when the Lord is inside of
[37:08] you,
[37:09] you'll always be mindful about the
[37:12] things of God.
[37:14] Thinking about the things of God,
[37:16] talking about the things of God, you
[37:19] know, because God is within you.
[37:22] Like when Nathan when he went and
[37:25] visited David
[37:27] and then David told Nathan
[37:30] how I sleep in a good house.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; But you see the ark of the Lord,
[37:38] it needs a permanent place.
[37:41] And then the prophet told the king,
[37:44] God is with you.
[37:47] Do what is in your heart. And we need to
[37:49] have the same testimony
[37:51] that you see the Lord is with me.
[37:55] Praise the name of our Lord. It should
[37:56] be that kind of thing that you know you
[38:00] can talk to God.
[38:02] He can talk to you and then you are
[38:05] certain
[38:07] you know you are sure that indeed the
[38:10] Lord lives with me.
[38:13] The Lord resides in me.
[38:16] And this is what the Bible tells us. He
[38:18] says, "I'll come unto you. I'll be in
[38:22] you."
[38:24] So the Lord is present
[38:27] within us.
[38:29] Praise the name of our Lord. But then
[38:30] the devil tells you is far away. He
[38:34] doesn't know even what's happening to
[38:36] you.
[38:38] That is not so. When you are born again,
[38:42] praise the name of our Lord. Christ
[38:44] himself
[38:46] lives within you.
[38:48] Praise the name of our Lord. You look at
[38:50] Saul when he was going to know to
[38:54] Damascus
[38:56] persecuting people
[38:59] and then the pillar of fire appeared to
[39:00] him along the way
[39:03] and then he called him in Hebrew.
[39:07] Saul
[39:09] where did he find Jesus to persecute?
[39:13] But Christ was living in the believers.
[39:19] Matthew chapter 25,
[39:21] he said, "When I was sick,
[39:24] you didn't visit me. When I was in
[39:27] prison, you didn't visit me. When I was
[39:30] hungry, you didn't give me food. You
[39:34] didn't give me food. When I was hungry,
[39:36] you didn't give me food."
[39:40] So, where was he? He was in the body
[39:43] form of believers.
[39:46] He was residing in believers.
[39:50] So God is right present
[39:53] in your life. Praise the name of our
[39:56] Lord. You don't need the devil to tell
[39:58] you
[40:00] is far away from you.
[40:03] It's just the devil deceiving you.
[40:06] Praise the name of Allah. So you need to
[40:08] believe.
[40:10] And now one thing about the scriptures,
[40:13] he said, I was in prison.
[40:15] Then you ask how can God be in prison?
[40:19] But he permits such a condition to come.
[40:23] I was hungry.
[40:25] How can God be hungry?
[40:28] But even Jesus was hungry. Even Jesus
[40:31] was put in prison.
[40:33] Even Jesus, he had wounds.
[40:37] In other words, he was sick.
[40:40] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[40:42] he took our burdens.
[40:45] He shared our sorrows.
[40:48] He took He took the pain of what we go
[40:50] through.
[40:52] He knows exactly what we go through.
[40:56] Praise the name of Lord. No wonder the
[40:57] Bible says, he is a high priest that is
[41:02] touched by the feeling of our infirmity.
[41:06] So whatever infirmity we have,
[41:09] God is concerned about your condition.
[41:13] God is concerned about your strength.
[41:16] And so you need to build faith.
[41:19] You need to have faith.
[41:22] It's the issue you want before God
[41:25] and say, "Lord, this is my petition.
[41:28] Lord, this is my desire." And now when
[41:31] you present it before the Lord,
[41:34] don't have doubt about it,
[41:37] but believe the Lord as I've presented
[41:40] this issue before
[41:43] you are going to have what I've asked
[41:45] him to have.
[41:47] Praise the name of the Lord. There is a
[41:49] testimony here.
[41:51] Praise the name of the Lord. There are
[41:53] people brother Brham had prayed for
[41:57] and then one had a stomach problem
[42:03] you know and different things
[42:06] and then brother Brandham pronounced
[42:08] them.
[42:09] Thus says the Lord
[42:12] you are healed.
[42:15] And then there was also another one who
[42:18] had a tumor
[42:20] you know just below her chin.
[42:23] And then also brother Brandham declared
[42:25] to them thus says the lord you are
[42:28] healed. And then it so happened that
[42:32] these people were hundreds of miles from
[42:34] the meeting.
[42:37] So they had traveled a long distance to
[42:40] go for those meetings
[42:42] and then they now they happened that
[42:44] they knew one another
[42:47] and then they drove together
[42:50] going and then they started testifying.
[42:53] For me it told me this. For me it told
[42:55] me this. But to them
[42:58] in their bodies there was like no
[43:01] change.
[43:04] So they went to their homes two three
[43:07] weeks
[43:09] no change but he told them you are
[43:12] healed says the lord and then the
[43:16] husband of one
[43:18] told the wife you know you are bringing
[43:20] a reproach to Christ
[43:23] because they kept on testifying
[43:26] I am healed I am healed I am healed then
[43:30] she told the husband
[43:32] that even if it takes 50 years,
[43:36] I will testify that I'm
[43:39] praise the name of. And then she told
[43:41] her husband, if he could tell me where I
[43:43] come from,
[43:48] she told me how I got this condition and
[43:50] he has also told me that I'm healed.
[43:55] Praise the name of Allah. The same thing
[43:57] with that congressman up
[44:00] [Music]
[44:04] You know, brother Brandham saw a vision
[44:08] and then he told him, "Hey, you got this
[44:11] suit.
[44:12] You you got this suit
[44:15] then this is how you change." He told
[44:17] him things before he came
[44:20] and then he told him, "God has healed
[44:22] you."
[44:24] Many years the man has been in a
[44:26] wheelchair.
[44:28] So the wife came and told him, "No,
[44:30] please. No, please.
[44:33] Don't come out.
[44:37] If he would tell me things before
[44:42] which are true, can he tell me things
[44:44] afterwards?
[44:47] Praise the name of our Lord. So you just
[44:49] need to see that you keep your faith
[44:52] in what you have asked God to do.
[44:56] Praise the name of our Lord. So then
[44:58] brother Brham says
[45:01] let us go that message El Shai
[45:07] I just want to read some section here.
[45:14] So this woman
[45:17] something just came and happened in her
[45:19] body and she just felt
[45:22] and then immediately she started feeling
[45:25] hungry
[45:27] and she started eating things that were
[45:29] troubling her because they were the only
[45:32] thing around.
[45:34] And then she went on doing her work and
[45:36] then she felt more hungry. Then she
[45:39] prepared and ate then she was going to
[45:42] the neighborhood.
[45:43] to go and testify.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; And now when she was reaching there, she
[45:49] heard a lot of screaming.
[45:53] So he says, "And when she got almost to
[45:56] the house,
[45:58] she heard somebody screaming down there
[46:01] at the top of their voice."
[46:05] And she ran to the door and jacked open.
[46:10] Here was this woman
[46:12] with the sheet in her hand,
[46:17] shaking the sheet,
[46:20] walking up and down the floor,
[46:23] asking what's the matter
[46:26] because the tumor was not there. She
[46:29] woke up when it was not there. And then
[46:31] she was wondering where is it?
[46:34] Checking on the sheet. How did it fall?
[46:37] The woman that had the lamp on her neck
[46:42] said, "You know what?" said, "This
[46:45] morning I got up
[46:48] and the lamp is gone.
[46:50] I've searched through the bed,
[46:53] shook the sheets everywhere
[46:56] and I can't find it anywhere."
[47:00] And then they come about 500 miles to
[47:03] testify of that.
[47:07] What was it? The angel of the Lord
[47:12] pass through the neighborhood that
[47:13] morning.
[47:16] See, sometimes God can't answer you just
[47:19] that moment.
[47:22] How many knows that Daniel prayed
[47:26] and it was 21 days before?
[47:29] Remember that. Sure. But when God says
[47:34] anything,
[47:36] God stays with his word.
[47:39] You stay with it too.
[47:43] But if you leave the word, you leave
[47:46] God. You leave your blessings and
[47:50] everything else. Stay and obey God's
[47:53] word.
[47:55] What God says,
[47:58] God does.
[48:00] Praise the name of our Lord. He says the
[48:02] angel was moving in the neighborhood.
[48:06] to fulfill the promise of God.
[48:10] Like in the morning we read that the
[48:13] shadow
[48:14] is standing between one's blessing
[48:20] and between one and the angel of the
[48:22] Lord.
[48:27] The angel has the blessing, right? But
[48:30] then there is doubt
[48:32] between you and the angel. You know the
[48:35] Bible says the angels of the Lord and
[48:39] camp around them that are righteous.
[48:43] You take it by faith that while I'm
[48:46] here, the angels of the Lord are here.
[48:49] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[48:51] say the footsteps of the righteous
[48:55] are ordered of the Lord. Have faith in
[48:58] yourself that my footsteps are being
[49:02] ordered of the Lord.
[49:04] You just have faith in the word and then
[49:07] you will see the presence of God
[49:10] magnified.
[49:12] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[49:14] presence of God coming over.
[49:17] You know like David when he told the
[49:19] prophet I need to build for the Lord
[49:23] then the prophet said you are right go
[49:26] ahead because God is in your heart. In
[49:30] other words it is God who has given you
[49:32] that burden
[49:34] do something.
[49:36] Praise the name of our Lord. And if you
[49:38] are a righteous person, then the
[49:41] footsteps of the Lord
[49:45] are ordered of the Lord. You shouldn't
[49:48] give up.
[49:50] Praise the name of the Lord. If the Lord
[49:52] puts a burden upon your heart,
[49:55] pray about it. Commit it to the Lord.
[49:58] Believe in the Lord for what you are
[49:59] praying.
[50:02] It will come to pass.
[50:05] It doesn't matter how long it takes.
[50:08] Praise the name of our Lord. Like
[50:09] Abraham waited 25 years or so
[50:15] waiting for the promise of God and God
[50:18] came and fulfilled it. The same thing
[50:21] with us also. Whatever I desire of the
[50:25] Lord,
[50:26] let me pray
[50:28] believing that the Lord will make it
[50:31] come.
[50:32] And so don't allow to be discouraged by
[50:34] any
[50:38] circumstance comes and you said these
[50:40] things I think they are not right
[50:43] don't do that praise the name of don't
[50:46] say I wish I could see first a vision
[50:50] brother Brandham said the visions could
[50:52] not hear
[50:53] [Music]
[50:59] the gift could not heal
[51:02] but it only increased your faith
[51:06] to know that sure the Lord is here
[51:09] to do that.
[51:11] So he would discern
[51:16] and then when he tells you that then it
[51:19] increases your faith.
[51:22] But now we have a sure word of God
[51:26] and faith comes by hearing God.
[51:30] So then you need to take the word of God
[51:34] and believe in the Lord and then see
[51:37] that the Lord
[51:39] performs what he has promised.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So don't
[51:44] allow unbelief to come between you.
[51:47] But believe the Lord that the Lord is
[51:50] present with me. His power is within me
[51:54] to work out upon my life to change me to
[51:59] transform me. Then you stop looking at
[52:02] your failures.
[52:04] You stop looking at your problems, but
[52:06] then you look at the promises of the
[52:08] Lord.
[52:10] Praise the name of Lord. That's how we
[52:12] need to live every other day.
[52:14] I'm looking at the promises of God.
[52:17] I'm counting my blessings.
[52:20] Praise the name of God, not my troubles.
[52:23] When the more you look at your troubles,
[52:26] the more you're going to get into
[52:27] complaining.
[52:29] When you go to complaining,
[52:31] darkness takes a hold of you. So you
[52:34] have no faith.
[52:36] You have you have doubt instead.
[52:40] You have unbelief.
[52:42] So it takes a hold of you. Now for me I
[52:45] don't know again this one here again
[52:48] this one here. But look at the positive
[52:51] things.
[52:54] Praise the name of the things that the
[52:56] Lord has done.
[52:59] and said, "The Lord did this for me. The
[53:01] Lord did this for me. The Lord did this
[53:03] for me. Praise the name of every day."
[53:08] We have many new things to testify
[53:09] about.
[53:12] Praise the name of how the Lord
[53:14] protected me through the night.
[53:17] You can testify about somebody that is
[53:21] also a testimony.
[53:23] Tell them, "Yeah, those who died at
[53:25] night,
[53:27] they have everything."
[53:30] And very strange enough, you get a rich
[53:33] man with everything,
[53:36] not even hospitalized,
[53:38] but he's dying. Then you get a man who
[53:41] has been bedridden for 10 years,
[53:46] doesn't have anything, but God is
[53:49] keeping it.
[53:52] So every day we live
[53:55] for the glory of God.
[53:58] Praise the name of our you know he
[54:00] watches over us. He takes charge over
[54:03] our lives.
[54:05] Then you can use the things that the
[54:06] Lord is doing.
[54:09] Say Lord I thank you.
[54:11] Lord I glorify your holy name.
[54:14] Praise the name of God. Like in the
[54:16] course of last week,
[54:19] our brother,
[54:22] you know, he was called to go to
[54:26] you know because the the pastor of that
[54:28] church had passed on last year.
[54:32] But he said that this church should
[54:34] believe should belong to the message.
[54:39] Whether two people remain or three,
[54:43] the church is for the message.
[54:46] But now some other people, you know,
[54:48] with inclinations to false teaching,
[54:53] they were saying, "No, no, no.
[54:57] We have to take over."
[54:59] So they fought
[55:02] but God helped to handle that situation.
[55:05] So now the wife of that pastor who
[55:08] pastor
[55:11] She was becoming also weak.
[55:15] She was hospitalized.
[55:17] So she called for brother
[55:20] and told him please my condition is not
[55:23] good but I want to hand over the church
[55:26] to you
[55:28] because there are some people who are
[55:29] here and they are trying to fight us.
[55:34] So then he went there and then now they
[55:37] were meant to make an agreement
[55:40] &gt;&gt; to change it as the as the the deceased
[55:44] pastor had wanted
[55:48] because the wife said I'm the only
[55:49] person remaining and this thing should
[55:50] be done when I'm still alive
[55:55] but the other group fought
[55:59] until now when brother K was trying to
[56:03] take you No photos.
[56:06] When they were in the meeting,
[56:08] about 12 people descended on him
[56:13] and they beat him. They had everything
[56:17] almost killing him.
[56:20] The other people just went to rescue
[56:21] him. They brought police to intervene
[56:25] and they arrested all these 12 people.
[56:30] And so what happened
[56:32] at the end of the day were arrested.
[56:35] Whatever was needed was done.
[56:38] And then the the the agreement was
[56:41] changed
[56:42] when the other people were in prison
[56:45] whether they were in police. But now
[56:47] where the miracle was,
[56:51] praise the name of when brother Ku went
[56:54] back home,
[56:56] you know, he was not feeling well.
[56:59] So when he went to the a certain place
[57:02] health center where he stays
[57:05] the medical person told him I advise you
[57:08] to go to Ha hospital
[57:11] where they have equipment to check you
[57:13] because your condition
[57:15] what you are saying you may be in a bad
[57:18] condition. So he went there that was on
[57:21] Tuesday that was last week on Tuesday
[57:25] and then the doctors told him you need
[57:27] to do scan of this
[57:30] test this blood test this test this. So
[57:33] when they went to do the scan,
[57:36] test the blood, everything, they found
[57:40] that I think it is the veins which take
[57:44] blood in his head.
[57:49] They are blocked.
[57:51] Then they started looking at him. Are
[57:53] you no more?
[57:57] He said, but I'm done. He said, no, you
[57:59] man. You don't know your condition. He
[58:02] said your condition is an emergency.
[58:06] You need to be in
[58:09] because you you can just run mad and you
[58:12] can never come back
[58:15] or you can die any time now.
[58:18] They were looking at the scans and
[58:20] they're looking at the person.
[58:22] The things were not matching.
[58:25] They brought other consultants
[58:28] they to check. They looked at him. What
[58:31] is your name?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; What do you do?
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Where did you come from? How did you
[58:35] come here?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Then he told him, but me people to give
[58:38] me treatment, I go back home.
[58:42] Said you man, you don't know what you
[58:43] are. We can never release you. So they
[58:47] held him in hospital.
[58:49] Then they called another specialist from
[58:51] Campala.
[58:53] The following day came and also checked
[58:55] said you man are you normal?
[58:58] What work do you do?
[59:00] He said, "I'm a pastor." He said, "Your
[59:02] God
[59:04] is the one who is just keeping you."
[59:08] So they held him another day
[59:12] trying to monitor.
[59:15] When the specialist came said, "Now you
[59:17] need to add another medicine because
[59:19] your condition is critical."
[59:23] And each tablet I think was how much
[59:25] money?
[59:27] I don't know whether it was 30,000 I
[59:30] don't know but a lot of money just one
[59:31] tablet
[59:34] and then they said we want to monitor
[59:36] you and see that you are not you don't
[59:38] become a disaster at home
[59:42] so they hold him there
[59:45] until Saturday I think it was yesterday
[59:47] or day before yesterday
[59:50] but you see the protection of God
[59:53] otherwise with that condition
[59:57] he would be dead now.
[1:00:00] So there's always the presence of God
[1:00:04] that watches over his children.
[1:00:07] And sometimes we don't know the Satan is
[1:00:09] attacking us.
[1:00:11] Praise the name of our so we need to be
[1:00:14] courageous.
[1:00:16] I know that the Lord is with me.
[1:00:20] The Lord is watching over my life.
[1:00:23] The Lord will lead me.
[1:00:26] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Now in the message,
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; the power of the devil,
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says
[1:00:43] we find here a daughter of Levi
[1:00:47] or a son of Levi went and married a
[1:00:50] daughter of Levi.
[1:00:56] This child was born and when it was born
[1:01:00] they seen that it was the right kind of
[1:01:02] a child
[1:01:07] and I hope you get this. She looked at
[1:01:10] that baby
[1:01:12] and there was something taking place.
[1:01:16] She knew
[1:01:18] that the time was nigh
[1:01:22] that they should be delivered
[1:01:25] and the Holy Spirit to my opinion
[1:01:30] revealed to her this is him
[1:01:35] and she wasn't afraid
[1:01:38] of the king's commandments
[1:01:41] and he threats.
[1:01:45] There you are. When faith takes a hold,
[1:01:51] fear drops away.
[1:01:55] Look at that woman. The king has said,
[1:01:57] "Kill all the male children."
[1:02:02] But then she said, "This one is a proper
[1:02:04] child.
[1:02:06] I'm not going to kill my child."
[1:02:09] and her faith took her hold
[1:02:12] and said, "Okay, I'm not going to keep
[1:02:14] my child in."
[1:02:16] And then she said, "Let me make an ark,
[1:02:21] you know, let me make a basket,
[1:02:24] you know, and then put him on the
[1:02:25] river."
[1:02:27] Leadership of God.
[1:02:30] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:02:32] how God leads us all.
[1:02:35] Then he says,
[1:02:40] When faith takes a hold,
[1:02:43] fear drops away.
[1:02:45] Faith has got big muscles
[1:02:50] and hairy chest.
[1:02:54] And when it speaks,
[1:02:56] everything else keeps quiet.
[1:03:00] Cancer has to shatter
[1:03:03] and get out of the way.
[1:03:06] tumor
[1:03:08] TB
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; and the rest of them
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; moves out when faith raises.
[1:03:19] Then he said, "Let it be King Pharaoh,
[1:03:27] whoever it was, when that little
[1:03:30] housewife raised up and looked at that
[1:03:33] child,
[1:03:36] She was not afraid
[1:03:39] what the king said. That's the second
[1:03:42] you know then he says
[1:03:47] Satan the power of the devil
[1:03:50] he has power and reign of death.
[1:03:55] But the second power was given
[1:03:59] was faith. And faith
[1:04:03] puts Satan to shame.
[1:04:06] Praise the name of the Lord. So use
[1:04:08] faith
[1:04:10] in your condition
[1:04:12] and then you'll see Satan back up.
[1:04:16] Darkness will go away. Doubt will go
[1:04:18] away.
[1:04:20] Will go away. You just need to have
[1:04:23] faith.
[1:04:25] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:04:27] you will see
[1:04:29] what you desire of the Lord
[1:04:33] come forth.
[1:04:35] Praise the name of God. Then in the
[1:04:37] message return and Jubilee,
[1:04:40] he says goes to show what faith can do.
[1:04:48] I think if a person is ever sure
[1:04:53] in their heart and as something that
[1:04:56] faith can anchor on,
[1:05:00] they should never cease.
[1:05:04] No matter how many times they are
[1:05:06] defeated,
[1:05:09] they should continue on.
[1:05:13] That is faith. Praise the name of the
[1:05:15] Lord. If you don't give up,
[1:05:19] You say, "Ah,
[1:05:21] this is what I'm on."
[1:05:24] Regardless of what happened,
[1:05:27] faith should take a firm ground.
[1:05:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Faith
[1:05:34] should take a firm ground
[1:05:38] and you know see that
[1:05:41] it is anchored
[1:05:43] and whatever you desire of the Lord
[1:05:47] pray believing
[1:05:49] but not that the Lord will do it.
[1:05:52] Praise the name of our Lord in the
[1:05:54] message the proof of his resurrection
[1:05:57] he says and here they are
[1:06:01] he was talking about Cleopus and his
[1:06:02] friend
[1:06:04] when they were moving to Emos
[1:06:07] discouraged now
[1:06:10] going back home.
[1:06:12] Well, we started out.
[1:06:15] We thought it would be all right,
[1:06:18] but we have to go back home now
[1:06:21] and they on the road back to Emma.
[1:06:26] And as they walked along
[1:06:30] discouraged,
[1:06:32] their conversation was right.
[1:06:38] They were talking about him.
[1:06:42] And that is when he appeared.
[1:06:45] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us have
[1:06:47] the courage of talking about God.
[1:06:51] At your home, you talk about God. You
[1:06:54] know what the Lord has done. You know
[1:06:56] the scripture I have read. Learn to be
[1:06:58] sharing
[1:07:00] as a family, maybe with your friends,
[1:07:04] with your neighbors. Praise the name of
[1:07:06] our Lord. Learn to talk about God
[1:07:10] that will be casting out unbelief.
[1:07:13] It will be casting out doubt.
[1:07:15] And brother Brandham says
[1:07:18] when you talk about God,
[1:07:21] that is when he appears.
[1:07:23] And that's the reason
[1:07:26] It doesn't appear
[1:07:28] to so many of us today
[1:07:32] why our conversations
[1:07:36] is talking about everything else but
[1:07:38] Christ
[1:07:39] [Music]
[1:07:42] has no room in your conversation.
[1:07:45] You see sometimes when you go to a
[1:07:47] restaurant
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; you have got food
[1:07:52] even you don't know you don't want your
[1:07:54] friends know that you're a Christian
[1:07:57] so when you are going to eat
[1:08:02] or you just say it in your heart
[1:08:05] be bold enough
[1:08:08] tell them God has given us this food let
[1:08:12] us bless this food
[1:08:14] praise the name
[1:08:16] have to start from
[1:08:19] there to observe
[1:08:23] this one to pray or not.
[1:08:27] You are eating with the devil.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; You have stolen God's food.
[1:08:33] You know there are those they don't want
[1:08:35] to show that you know.
[1:08:39] Oh, just bends a little. Amen.
[1:08:44] Now, the Bible says, "Sanctify the food
[1:08:49] by the word of prayer."
[1:08:52] Yeah, you do that. Learn it to be part
[1:08:55] of you.
[1:08:57] Lord, we commit this food into your
[1:08:59] hands. May you bless and sanctify it for
[1:09:03] the use of our body in Jesus's name.
[1:09:06] Then the other will start looking
[1:09:07] around.
[1:09:10] Yeah, let them know you are there.
[1:09:13] Of course, you're not going to shout at
[1:09:14] the top of your voice, but they going to
[1:09:17] observe
[1:09:18] [Music]
[1:09:24] without prayer.
[1:09:27] You know, there was a child who was
[1:09:28] kidnapped. I don't know which place
[1:09:30] exactly.
[1:09:36] You know those people who do things are
[1:09:38] just rough people.
[1:09:40] So they took the child to the restaurant
[1:09:43] and then they ordered the food. What do
[1:09:46] you want to eat?
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; This now for them they got the food
[1:09:51] started just eating. But this child was
[1:09:54] taught don't eat without praying.
[1:09:58] So the child was waiting for prayer.
[1:10:01] You eat and said I can't eat without
[1:10:04] prayer.
[1:10:06] was then this man was forcing the child
[1:10:09] the child was not eating then the people
[1:10:11] in the restaurant said there is
[1:10:13] something wrong here that's how that
[1:10:15] child was saved
[1:10:19] praise the name of God just coming down
[1:10:22] on the scene
[1:10:25] what do you call this child
[1:10:30] that's how the child was delivered
[1:10:33] so we need to see
[1:10:36] Learn to talk about God.
[1:10:39] When you are eating, you can die. You
[1:10:43] know what the Lord has done. You know,
[1:10:45] there are some of those who are
[1:10:46] nonbelievers
[1:10:48] and they fear poison.
[1:10:51] So when they believe when they walk with
[1:10:52] the believer
[1:10:55] like a pastor
[1:10:57] because they know your prayer is going
[1:10:59] to sanctify the poison
[1:11:04] but take opportunity to talk to them
[1:11:06] about God.
[1:11:09] Maybe you have meetings
[1:11:12] you can tell them let us open the
[1:11:13] meeting with prayer.
[1:11:16] People are afraid of praying.
[1:11:18] People are always afraid of praying.
[1:11:21] So let us pray. You commit it to the
[1:11:23] hand. Then you see somebody ah before we
[1:11:26] go let us let pastor pray for us.
[1:11:33] Now our journey is safe.
[1:11:35] You are having opportunity to talk to
[1:11:37] them about it
[1:11:39] and as they humble themselves you can
[1:11:42] tell them what will you do on the
[1:11:44] judgment day.
[1:11:47] Hey you bring that in.
[1:11:50] There's a judgment day.
[1:11:53] When both started speaking before the
[1:11:55] king
[1:11:57] about the resurrection from the dead,
[1:12:00] the power of resurrection, the judgment
[1:12:03] that is coming, the king started
[1:12:05] trembling.
[1:12:07] The knees started beating one another.
[1:12:10] Said, "You go back. You'll tell me
[1:12:12] another time."
[1:12:15] You know but these things help
[1:12:18] to witness Christ to those people.
[1:12:22] Praise the name of our Lord. So always
[1:12:24] take opportunity to talk about God.
[1:12:29] When somebody see to them what the Lord
[1:12:32] has done,
[1:12:34] tell them you know there was this person
[1:12:35] who had this issue. This is what
[1:12:37] happened to them. There was another
[1:12:39] person who had this issue. This is what
[1:12:41] happened to them. Like when you read
[1:12:43] most of these message books,
[1:12:46] brother Brennham comes and gives
[1:12:47] testimonies
[1:12:49] about what the Lord did here, what the
[1:12:51] Lord did here, what the Lord did here.
[1:12:54] And then it builds up somebody's
[1:12:58] to bring it to reality.
[1:13:01] They are in the presence of the Lord.
[1:13:04] That the Lord is present with them.
[1:13:06] There should be also the same thing with
[1:13:07] us. Talk about the goodness of the Lord.
[1:13:12] Think about the goodness of the Lord.
[1:13:15] Praise the name of our Lord. Don't think
[1:13:17] about negative things
[1:13:20] all the time. Negative things, feeding
[1:13:23] on negative things, but there are
[1:13:25] positive things you can talk about.
[1:13:28] There are positive things you can think
[1:13:30] about.
[1:13:32] And then they increase your faith.
[1:13:35] They declare the presence of God.
[1:13:39] Praise the name of God. And God who
[1:13:42] always want to be testified about
[1:13:45] the things that he has done. Praise the
[1:13:48] name of our Lord. Let that be part of
[1:13:50] you all.
[1:13:52] Maybe you in the market. Praise the name
[1:13:55] of our Lord. You know this shouting
[1:13:57] there. One is shouting there. The other
[1:14:00] one is talking about the against the
[1:14:02] coine
[1:14:05] and the other one is on this. Talk about
[1:14:08] the goodness of the Lord.
[1:14:10] Talk about what the Lord has done. Not
[1:14:13] all the time on loses again
[1:14:18] this council again this one here again
[1:14:22] the other
[1:14:24] neighbor there
[1:14:26] take time and talk about the goodness of
[1:14:28] God. Even in the midst of all those
[1:14:30] disappointment,
[1:14:33] praise the name of God, talk good
[1:14:37] what the Lord has done. And then it
[1:14:40] builds your faith.
[1:14:42] It makes you motivated.
[1:14:45] And when you are praying, you know, your
[1:14:47] heart is merry.
[1:14:50] Praise the name of our Lord. You are
[1:14:52] just saying, Lord, I thank you for what
[1:14:55] you have done for my life. how you
[1:14:57] protected me. Lord, I thank you like
[1:15:01] these women. They were testifying.
[1:15:05] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:15:06] the angel came and delivered their
[1:15:08] messages.
[1:15:11] Praise the name of our Lord. We just
[1:15:13] need to always take time
[1:15:16] and testify about the goodness of the
[1:15:18] Lord.
[1:15:20] What the Lord has done in my life.
[1:15:24] The presence of God. Praise the name of
[1:15:27] our Lord is always talk about him.
[1:15:30] Praise the name of our Lord. As I
[1:15:33] finish, let us go to Mark chapter 16
[1:15:37] and then verse 17.
[1:15:42] He says, "And these signs shall follow
[1:15:45] them that believe."
[1:15:51] We don't follow signs,
[1:15:54] but signs follow us.
[1:15:57] If you believe, he says, "In my name,
[1:16:01] they shall cast out devils.
[1:16:04] They shall speak with new tongue,
[1:16:07] and they shall take up serpents.
[1:16:10] And if they drink any deadly thing,
[1:16:13] it shall not hurt them.
[1:16:17] They shall lay hands on the sick
[1:16:20] and they shall recover.
[1:16:22] Praise the name of Lord. We have these
[1:16:25] promises with us
[1:16:27] that as a believer, you can pray for
[1:16:30] anybody
[1:16:32] in whatever condition they invested
[1:16:48] this. I pray you make it come to pass.
[1:16:51] He said, believers,
[1:16:54] Brothers or sisters,
[1:16:57] as long as you're a believer, you can
[1:17:00] lay your hands on the sick
[1:17:03] and they can recover. Praise the name of
[1:17:05] our Lord. You can pray for any
[1:17:07] situation.
[1:17:09] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:17:11] there are mothers who have children and
[1:17:14] the children are stubborn.
[1:17:16] I would look at this stubborn child.
[1:17:20] That stubborn child. Why are you praying
[1:17:22] him to be stubborn?
[1:17:26] Bless him.
[1:17:28] Praise the name of our change.
[1:17:32] If he's stubborn, cast out that demon.
[1:17:37] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:17:43] You are praying him to be that
[1:17:48] because word has authority.
[1:17:51] So you are enforcing it and the more you
[1:17:54] talk about it, the more you believe it.
[1:18:04] Hey, but turn it around.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Pronounce a blessing.
[1:18:10] Praise the name of pronounce a blessing
[1:18:13] upon your child.
[1:18:15] Pronounce a blessing upon your family.
[1:18:18] Pronounce a blessing upon your place.
[1:18:22] Pronounce a blessing upon the place you
[1:18:23] live in.
[1:18:25] You know you are the signs followed them
[1:18:28] that believe.
[1:18:31] Praise the name of Lord. So you
[1:18:33] pronounce a blessing.
[1:18:36] I'm praying for where I'm staying.
[1:18:38] I'm praying this condition goes away.
[1:18:41] I'm praying this thing doesn't happen
[1:18:43] again.
[1:18:44] I am praying for the protection of God
[1:18:48] that the thieves can no longer come and
[1:18:50] distur.
[1:18:53] You know you can do this kind of thing.
[1:18:56] Praise the name of the Lord. So it says
[1:18:59] this sign shall follow them that
[1:19:02] believe.
[1:19:06] Whatever you have need of
[1:19:08] bring it to the Lord in prayer.
[1:19:11] Praise the name of the Lord. Just bring
[1:19:13] it to the Lord in prayer. And believe
[1:19:16] the Lord will do it. Praise the name of
[1:19:19] the Lord. The Lord is always available.
[1:19:24] Praise the name of the Lord to perform
[1:19:26] his word.
[1:19:27] But then we have to believe
[1:19:30] Lord I'm doing all these things
[1:19:33] according to your word.
[1:19:35] You promised us that whatever we ask
[1:19:39] you'll give it to us that our joy
[1:19:44] may be complete.
[1:19:46] That's what the scripture saying in the
[1:19:48] book of John.
[1:19:51] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; He says whatever you desire
[1:19:58] Pray and will be answered
[1:20:02] that your joy may be complete
[1:20:06] or your joy may be full.
[1:20:09] Praise the name of the Lord. Let me get
[1:20:11] that in the book of John.
[1:20:15] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:20:22] John chapter 15.
[1:20:27] Okay. John chapter 16 verse 24.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; let us start from verse
[1:20:39] 23.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; And in that day you shall ask me
[1:20:44] nothing. Verily I say unto you,
[1:20:47] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[1:20:50] my name, he will give it to you.
[1:21:05] He that have you asked nothing in my
[1:21:07] name? Ask and you shall receive that
[1:21:10] your joy may be full.
[1:21:22] Praise the name of our Lord that your
[1:21:25] joy may be full.
[1:21:27] So he has promised us to ask him.
[1:21:31] You take it by faith.
[1:21:33] Lord, this is my desire. Lord, this is
[1:21:36] my petition.
[1:21:38] I want my joy to
[1:21:41] praise the name of our Lord. And you
[1:21:42] believe God for what you asking.
[1:21:46] And then you don't just be in a panic
[1:21:49] mood,
[1:21:52] you know, but be patient with the Lord.
[1:21:55] Trust in the Lord. Depend upon the Lord
[1:21:59] and see the Lord coming to fulfill the
[1:22:01] desire.
[1:22:03] Praise the name of our Lord. The Lord is
[1:22:06] always present with us.
[1:22:09] We shouldn't allow the devil
[1:22:12] to think God is far away from us.
[1:22:15] I believe is right inside of you.
[1:22:18] What is right with you and his desire is
[1:22:22] to help you at all times.
[1:22:25] A very present help
[1:22:28] in the time of trouble. Pray in the name
[1:22:30] of Lord. So don't allow any stress to
[1:22:33] dismay.
[1:22:35] Don't allow any condition to come
[1:22:38] that will make your mind become negative
[1:22:40] about the things.
[1:22:43] Learn to be positive.
[1:22:45] Lord, this is my strateg. Lord, I commit
[1:22:48] you this challenge. Lord, I commit you
[1:22:51] this need and allow the Lord to take
[1:22:54] charge over the condition.
[1:22:56] Praise the name of our may God bless
[1:22:58] you.
[1:23:00] Amen.
[1:23:01] Let us sing that song. What a friend we
[1:23:03] have in Jesus. As the song leader comes,
[1:23:07] praise the name of our Lord. Make Jesus

[1:44:26] as we get on our feet
[1:44:30] [Music]
[1:44:33] to sing
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; in English.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Oh precious Jesus,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; I'm ready. I am ready.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to surrender
[1:44:50] to surrender.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Surrender every care, every
[1:44:55] as you wash me, Lord, as I commune with
[1:44:58] you. Oh, take my hand.
[1:45:02] lead me closer and bring me closer.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need Lord I need
[1:45:12] to meet you there.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:45:19] We've come now to the time of the Lord's
[1:45:21] supper.
[1:45:24] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:45:26] So let us go to First Corinians.
[1:45:32] And then chapter 11,
[1:45:36] we are reading from verse 23
[1:45:41] up to verse 28.
[1:45:45] We always do this once in a month
[1:45:49] in the tabernacle.
[1:45:51] We're also doing it either I think at
[1:45:53] the end of the month or something like
[1:45:54] that.
[1:45:57] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:45:59] the Bible says as often as you would.
[1:46:05] When you read in the book of Acts
[1:46:06] chapter two,
[1:46:09] they were doing it whenever they were
[1:46:10] gathering
[1:46:12] and their gatherings were in houses.
[1:46:15] So they would always do it and we just
[1:46:18] thank God that is giving us grace
[1:46:22] that we able to do this say that is part
[1:46:25] of our commitment to the Lord.
[1:46:30] There are many places where they have
[1:46:31] never done it.
[1:46:34] But you know it it we thank God that is
[1:46:38] giving us the grace to do it. You know
[1:46:42] even the Bible says that a widow was not
[1:46:45] counted a widow
[1:46:49] faithful
[1:46:51] if she had not washed the disciples
[1:46:54] feet.
[1:46:59] So it is very important us as believers
[1:47:03] to participate in this. It shows our
[1:47:06] commitment
[1:47:10] to what we believe.
[1:47:12] Praise the name of. So the Bible says,
[1:47:15] "For I have received of the Lord that
[1:47:17] which also I delivered unto you, that
[1:47:20] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:47:22] he was betrayed took bread,
[1:47:34] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[1:47:36] it and said, "Take it. This is my body
[1:47:39] which is broken for you. This do in
[1:47:42] remembrance of me."
[1:47:52] After the same manner also he took the
[1:47:54] cup when he had sapped saying this cup
[1:47:57] is the new testament in my blood. This
[1:48:00] do as you oft
[1:48:02] remembrance of me.
[1:48:15] For as often as you eat this bread and
[1:48:17] drink this cup, you do show the Lord
[1:48:19] this death till he come.
[1:48:30] Wherefore soever shall eat this bread
[1:48:32] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:48:34] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:48:37] and the blood of the Lord.
[1:48:53] But let a man examine himself, and so
[1:48:56] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:48:58] that cup.
[1:49:08] Let us pray.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:49:12] Christ,
[1:49:14] we thank you for this moment of time
[1:49:17] that Lord, you've given unto us an
[1:49:19] opportunity
[1:49:21] that we can come to the Lord's table
[1:49:24] to fulfill what you did
[1:49:27] on the Good Friday
[1:49:30] or what you did on the Thursday rather.
[1:49:34] And Lord we remember
[1:49:37] it's who started this
[1:49:40] then you commanded Moses
[1:49:44] Passover
[1:49:46] and then you came and fulfilled it
[1:49:47] yourself
[1:49:49] to fulfill what did and what Moses did.
[1:49:56] You did the same and you went and
[1:49:58] fulfilled being the Passover lamb
[1:50:02] and we want to thank you father.
[1:50:04] It is such a solemn moment of time
[1:50:08] that we come to observe what you
[1:50:10] commanded us.
[1:50:12] And Lord, we've read in the scriptures,
[1:50:15] how you broke the bread, the unleavened
[1:50:18] bread, and how also you gave out the
[1:50:21] wine,
[1:50:23] symbolizing your body and your spirit.
[1:50:28] And here we have elements that have been
[1:50:30] prepared,
[1:50:32] the unleavened bread,
[1:50:34] and likewise the wine. We pray that you
[1:50:37] may sanctify them heavenly
[1:50:39] that they may be able to meet the
[1:50:41] purpose
[1:50:43] for the glory of your holy name. We also
[1:50:46] pray heavenly father that as we partake
[1:50:49] of them we may be blessed of the Lord.
[1:50:54] Father we pray if any of us is unworthy
[1:50:58] may you Lord forgive us. May you make us
[1:51:01] worthy Lord.
[1:51:03] We can't make ourselves one, but it's
[1:51:06] only the blood of Jesus Christ that can
[1:51:09] make us one. And so we pray may wash us
[1:51:12] fast from all unrighteousness,
[1:51:16] all powers of darkness
[1:51:18] from everything that's unlike.
[1:51:21] Father, Lord, we may be worthy to
[1:51:24] partake of you. are not only being
[1:51:27] worthy now,
[1:51:29] but help us to live a life that is
[1:51:32] worthy of the gospel. That every day we
[1:51:34] live, we may live in your worthiness,
[1:51:38] washed in the blood of Jesus,
[1:51:41] filled with the Holy Spirit, walking in
[1:51:44] tress, Lord, walking in the light of
[1:51:48] we pray bless us all.
[1:51:50] Grant all our hearts desire
[1:51:53] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:51:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; I think we can now break.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; One day when heaven was filled with
[1:52:13] these praisees.
[1:52:18] One day when sin was as black as could
[1:52:23] be,
[1:52:27] Jesus came forth to be born of
[1:52:35] a
[1:52:37] dwelt amongst
[1:52:41] men.
[1:52:42] My example
[1:52:44] is he
[1:52:48] all livinging he love
[1:52:52] me
