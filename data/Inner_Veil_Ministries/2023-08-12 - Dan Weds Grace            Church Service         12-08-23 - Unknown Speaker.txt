your children and their children and their children the children and their children [Applause] foreign wow [Music] amen praise the name of our Lord we are going to our last session here at church I just want to take about 30 minutes I'm requesting we stand on our feet and we go to our Bibles and then we read in Genesis chapter 2. and then Verse 18 to verse 24 a candidates the first marriage that was done the Bible says and the Lord said it's not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meet for him and then we can jump to verse 21. and the Lord God caused the Deep Sleep fall upon Adam and he slept and took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead of um which the Lord God had taken from man maybe a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now born of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh he shall be called a woman because she was taken out of a man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave at his wife flesho foreign amen God blessing of this world let us pray fast god so keep survey father we thank you for your love grace and mercy thank you for the marriage of our brother Dana and Grace and as we go to this word of exhortations come and speak to our hearts Jesus in the name of the Lord amen you may be seated foreign praise the name of our Lord just briefly I know time is not enough I want to preach on the marriage made by God the marriage made by God forever you can make your own marriage any person can make their own marriage but we are interested the marriage made by God praise her name and so here we've seen in Genesis first marriage was made by God and in a marriage should also be made by God and we believe here tonight that the marriage of Dan and Grace has also being made by God said it is not good for a man to be alone so God realize he created man as a single individual but then the other animals the birds he met them when it came to mind he made only one and then man was on us and then God said not good for man to be alone but you see the loneliness that God is talking about you it's not meaning that Adam was literally alone in the garden there were animals God was also there so God is not talking about that loneliness is talking about the loneliness of identity and so yeah then we find that in marriage if your marriage is made by God you identify what is like that's why when Adam the Bible says God brought animals and God was asking Adam what is this then Adam saw the animal jumping and say that one is that people are finding comforting animals you know like some people don't want produce children they would rather have dolls or have cats or dogs and things like that conditions and you give to the dogs God cannot get the right person a precious person [Applause] so if you want to get a right husband ask yourself are you right before God if you want to get away right ask yourself are you right before God because the Bible says they shall deceived and they will also be deceived so if for you are pretending to be right before God you will be deceived to get the wrong person and when you're in your house you start wondering how did I come to this one again how did they get you okay so you need to be right with God first so now when Adam when God made foreign [Music] foreign now you mean you are taking somebody to keep on morning in your house only God has the best now the next thing like I was listening the testimony of Dan when done and then he was saying [Music] and then Grace also was giving a testament to somebody else and then now what happened Grace was asking done who gave you my contact number and now Grace had the mystery Grace then he said this is the right person why right it all started from the shepherd to guide but people don't want to bring in their pastors when they are starting the issues of relationships they want to just get maybe at school or at places oh this one I went and visited the other relatives the source is only in the Lord praise the name of Allah now let us look at the weakness of man in first summer chapter 16. first Samuel chapter 16. foreign desire to get a king and so God told Prophet somewhere go to the house of Jesus chapter 16 verse and the Lord said unto somewhere how long will you mourn for soul objected him from reigning over Israel fill thine horn with oil and I will send it to Jesse for I have provided me a king among his sons it was only one son that God had the chosen to be the king and now this is also the Dilemma where the young people find themselves you you believe the message I'm not meant to marry from people who don't believe the message and that is right but if you're not married it's not that every sister or brother you find in the message foreign and he said peacefully that you're going to come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify your sins I will come with me to sacrifice and his sons and called them to the sacrifice and it came to pass when they were calm that he looked on earlier the Lord foreign you know not on his continent foreign how are you going to make a choice that means you have to depend upon God to lead you to the right person and I believe my brother praise the name of us you went beyond what you see the name of Allah and then you went to the hearts because if your heart are not neat together you'll fail in your marriage God looks at the heart and even our choice for a married person should be looking at the heart but in the Bible says you know the heart is so deceptive you need the Lord to guide you to the right person so the firstborn came God rejected the second Point God rejected and then someone was wondering all the sons he was forming a wife for Adam allow God to bring the right person for you and when the Lord brings the right person it's the Lord that will make that marriage and I believe we are witnessing such a marriage that the Lord himself God does not look what this teacher God looks at the heart praise the name of Allah now in the book of hospitals I try to finish the name of Allah the Bible says in verse one likewise your wives be in some objection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also mean without the word be warned by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chest conversation coupled with fear Bible who's adorning let it not be the outward dawning of plating of the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of April um but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price God desires character so when you are choosing a wife for marriage choose character the Bible says when the outside women look at the behavior of the wives then they are converted to Christ they desired the life of the person they are living like in the neighborhood you're going to live you need to display the character of Jesus they display the character of Jesus that one is a great price when when Abraham Ibrahim wanted the wife for his son Isaac in Genesis chapter 24 we're not going to read this you see that eliences when he went to the world and he prayed to the Lord Praise so now our marriage water for all your animals so and Elias I chose character yes in the Book of Esther when the king of Australia's desired a wife we also chose characters so the marriage that is made of God is a marriage that is standing on the character of Jesus Christ and so my brother Dan and sister Grace should stand on the characters don't cease being good don't cease fear in the Lord stand on the word of God stand on the character of Jesus Christ look what the nature of Jesus Christ what does the word of God desire and so you should stand on that same way we go back to First Peter chapter 3. and then verse 7 as I finish likewise dwell with them according to knowledge and as being here as together of the grace of Life prayers foreign you need to bless your neighbors you need to bless your colleagues and desire good foreign foreign um foreign foreign and you know these places the moment any problem happens to you they start looking immediately for somebody free bless you but yeah but at the end of the day any problem you go through every time it is your family that suffers so you shouldn't forget your family for your work don't forget your family your friends don't forget your family your family is part of you should always learn to stand there with your family we need to live in a marriage that's made by God amen amen let us finish with Matthew chapter 19. Matthew chapter 19 praise the name of Allah and then verse three a Canadian Cooks the first is also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for him mzy forever because foreign and sent for this course shall a man live father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they trying shall be one flesh um wherefore they are no more trying but one flesh what they are for God has joined together let no man put asunder um so it's not money joining you that is God joining don't allow circumstances don't allow Financial issues don't allow any kind of issue coming between you again but let God bind you together the Bible says they are no longer too respect for one another love foreign foreign [Applause] father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we thank you again for your blessings for your goodness upon us we thank for the marriage and again father we pray we establish the marriage of our brothers Lord may be a good reflection it may be a good example where people cannot bear with one another you cannot live in holy mountains thank you [Applause] God bless you you are all welcome to this functions and I just want to take two minutes to congratulate Dan and Grace for bringing their love in public they've given us a testimony I also want to appreciate pastor who has pastored the family of Grace and instilled the kind of character that our brother decided to choose you've done the best you can there's no small function no so many people are scared of coming out to do a function but we appreciate the Pirates of Grace they've participated a lot to make this possible and let's give them a hand of praise [Applause] uh maybe let them stand up for recognition the parents of Grace Grace [Applause] if you exchange the head of the mother and Grace Cinema they become the same person thank you so much thank you so much so young people Jonathan and the rest of you Stephen it is very simple if Dan can do it let us all do it [Applause] done done God bless you Grace Grace God bless you have been looking out for those Smiles which never sees us may the Lord bless you with certainly appreciate so much and God bless you amen amen where is Moses who is the person to tell us what comes next where are you Stephen where's brother okay in the meantime brother Moses can come and take over the service but thank you so much for honoring done and Grace whatever you've done the Lord will bless you God bless you [Applause] yeah we thank God for this moment God bless you congratulations Dan and Grace we thank God for this great achievement you reached this day our dear guests your most welcome we are happy to be with you we know that you've sacrificed to travel a long way to come and be with us this day we are really grateful thank you very much so uh the bridal team is going to move out first then they will pause out there just for a few photos be brief okay um they're going to stand here for a few photos then March out then the rest of us will March out after they've moved out nobody I don't expect anybody to move out before them they are the big people of the day and uh I really we need to we think I think we need to give them the honor and the privilege to feel that the day is theirs congratulations Dan congratulations Grace and the groomsmen congratulations but in our device yes so I think the music team can take over yes [Music] um after here we are going to match the reception the reception is just right here they are labels on each tent who have the parents of the groom and the bride the parents of the Bride will sit beside I mean also family when we talk of parents we also mean the family the bride will sit on this side the groom will sit on the other side church and friends will sit on the 10th just below and feel at home be relaxed I think we really need to go through the program quickly so that we end early thank you very much God bless you musicians please cameraman be quick be very quick our guests came from far [Music] done please don't let go of that hand from now onwards foreign [Music] for them [Music] bride and groom basement and matron make a quick join a quick photo the pastors who are here past us and the parents [Music] parents please join [Music] Pastor James you're welcome [Music] behind them congratulations [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] everybody [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] all right everybody ready [Music] wherever it is foreign forever wonders [Music] [Music] [Music] where are we
