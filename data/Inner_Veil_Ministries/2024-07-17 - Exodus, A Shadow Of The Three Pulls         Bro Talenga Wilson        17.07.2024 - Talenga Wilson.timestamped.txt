[17:34] that Abraham walk before you then he
[17:37] becomes perfect father Lord Jesus Christ

[17:50] them through Thy word because Thy word
[17:53] is truth Thy word is the sanctifier Thy

[34:49] come to a
[34:50] time after God had visited
[34:53] Moses and had told him in the burning
[34:57] bush
[34:59] come down to deliver his people from
[35:02] bondage praise the Lord and God gave
[35:05] instructions to
[35:07] Moses on how Moses was going to do
[35:10] it so Moses went and started doing
[35:14] according to how the Lord had
[35:16] instructed so when Moses reached
[35:20] up Pharaoh it was not it was not an easy
[35:25] way for him
[35:28] so Pharaoh
[35:29] refused and said no the people shall not
[35:32] go and we know the many things that God
[35:35] did in
[35:36] Egypt in order to soften the heart of
[35:40] pharaoh praise the living now everything
[35:45] that Moses was
[35:46] doing pharaoh and magans were
[35:49] impersonating and doing the same
[35:52] thing praise the Living God came now to
[35:56] at this point
[35:58] this was
[35:59] different and they could not impersonate
[36:03] it and the Bible says speak all speak
[36:08] unto all the congregation of Israel
[36:12] saying in the 10 day of this
[36:15] month they shall take to them every man
[36:18] a
[36:20] lamb according to the house of their
[36:23] fathers a lamb for an house
[36:28] so Moses went and told the people and
[36:31] remember these
[36:33] people were living in
[36:35] Egypt and
[36:37] now their
[36:40] supervisors their T
[36:42] Masters were
[36:44] Egyptians so they had every instruction
[36:47] that God had given to Moses and how
[36:49] Moses was giving it to the
[36:54] people take the message to pharaoh
[36:58] that's how Pharaoh was able to
[37:01] impersonate every miracle that God was
[37:04] doing in their
[37:06] midst and now when it came to this
[37:09] time the word of the Lord came
[37:12] saying tell the congregation of
[37:16] Israel that in the 10th day of this
[37:19] month they shall take to them every man
[37:23] lamb according the house of their
[37:25] fathers
[37:28] and in verse seven and they shall take
[37:31] of the
[37:32] blood so they were instructed to go
[37:35] sacrifies this
[37:37] lamb Slaughter it and then apply the
[37:41] blood the Bible says and they shall take
[37:44] of the
[37:45] blood and strike it on the two side
[37:48] [Music]
[37:50] posts and the upper door
[37:53] post and of the houses wherein they
[37:57] shall eat it and verse
[38:00] 11 and thus shall ye eat
[38:03] it with your Lo
[38:06] guarded your shoes on your
[38:09] feet your stuff in your
[38:12] hand and he shall eat it in
[38:15] haste it is the Lord's
[38:19] Passover I will pass through the land of
[38:22] Egypt this
[38:24] night so now God spoke the word
[38:28] God spoke to Moses said Moses go and
[38:31] speak
[38:33] this is a spoken word praise the Lord so
[38:37] it was the word that God had given to
[38:40] Moses so it was God's
[38:43] word was God his
[38:45] instruction and now when the Egyptians
[38:48] heard
[38:48] it praise the Lord they did not have the
[38:54] mind of God to believe it
[38:57] the first things that
[38:59] happened talk about the
[39:01] Flies praise the Lord whatever Moses was
[39:05] doing they could do it talk about the
[39:09] snakes they could also do it praise the
[39:13] Lord because they saw Moses do it so
[39:16] they could now do it but now this time
[39:20] this was a spoken
[39:22] words this was the this was a matter of
[39:25] the heart
[39:27] for them to believe so when they heard
[39:30] it there was no way they could believe
[39:33] it there was no they could receive it
[39:36] because it was not ordained for them
[39:39] to even when they heard the word praise
[39:43] the Lord and they had Moses speaking to
[39:45] the children
[39:46] is they had nothing do about
[39:49] it praise the Lord why it was not given
[39:53] unto them prise the Lord there's
[39:56] something special
[39:57] here this spoken word the devil could
[40:01] not
[40:03] impersonate spoken word Pharaoh could
[40:06] not
[40:07] impersonate because he had no power to
[40:10] do
[40:11] it praise the Lord and now he could not
[40:14] believe it and the TK Masters and the
[40:18] enti Egypt so now when Moses spoke to
[40:21] them he said now this is the Lord's
[40:25] Passover and the Lord says I will pass
[40:28] through the land of
[40:31] Egypt this
[40:33] night praise the Lord remember it was
[40:36] before
[40:37] time praise the Lord it was at the
[40:40] beginning of the
[40:41] month when the word of the Lord came
[40:43] unto
[40:45] them came unto Moses and it was a space
[40:48] of 10
[40:50] days praise the Lord he says in the 10th
[40:53] day of this month
[40:57] enough time praise the Lord and now the
[41:00] Bible
[41:02] says I will pass through the land of
[41:04] Egypt this
[41:08] night and will Smite all the firstborn
[41:10] in the land of
[41:13] Egypt man and
[41:15] Beast against all the gods of
[41:19] Egypt judgment I am the
[41:22] Lord and the blood shall beat you for a
[41:26] token
[41:27] upon the houses where you
[41:29] were praise the Lord so now when they
[41:32] heard the word they did according to the
[41:35] spoken
[41:36] word they received the word of God
[41:39] through
[41:40] Moses and when they received they
[41:42] believed it and whoever believed it and
[41:46] obey the
[41:47] instructions when the death angel
[41:50] passed the Bible says when I see the
[41:54] blood I will pass over you that was the
[41:58] tokenise the Lord but now this token
[42:02] came from the spoken
[42:04] words praise the Lord it came from the
[42:07] Vindicated
[42:08] words that Moses spoke to them which
[42:13] words could not be
[42:16] received by the rest of them except
[42:19] those that God had
[42:21] Ed praise the Living God so now we
[42:25] notice that at at uh in this
[42:29] Exodus after all the things that God had
[42:34] done this was the
[42:37] climax praise the lord of the process
[42:40] when God was bringing them out of
[42:43] Egypt to start set off their
[42:46] Journey to the promised land praise the
[42:49] Lord And now when they obey the
[42:52] instructions and had done according to
[42:54] how God had instructed
[42:57] they were
[42:58] spared but as they were
[43:00] spared it was
[43:03] whales praise the Lord it was it was
[43:07] sadness it was sorrow in the rest of the
[43:11] people that did not receive the words
[43:15] did not obey the words not apply the
[43:18] words praise the Living God so now we
[43:23] see that The
[43:25] Magicians praise the Lord would have
[43:28] heard this word they would have heard
[43:31] everything have the
[43:34] instructions but there is a hidden thing
[43:38] here God did not give them the
[43:41] Revelation to understand the power of
[43:43] the
[43:44] token were to
[43:46] apply the Lord so now in like the way
[43:49] they did it
[43:51] before were waiting to see what Moses
[43:53] was going
[43:55] to and yet this time
[43:57] it was not
[43:59] Moses praise the Lord it was the people
[44:03] because the instruction was go and tell
[44:06] the people so now it was the
[44:09] experience of the people with the
[44:12] words every
[44:14] individual every household they had to
[44:17] come into experience with spoken
[44:21] word app the token so now as they were
[44:24] waiting to see
[44:27] they saw was death in their
[44:30] caise the Lord so they could not
[44:32] impersonate it it was
[44:35] hidden for them to know receive the
[44:39] Revelation for them to believe
[44:42] it the entire Egypt would have applied
[44:45] the
[44:46] token praise the Lord so now we see that
[44:49] this
[44:50] token we see that this spoken
[44:53] word is but for the elect
[44:57] this spoken word is but for the
[45:01] predated spoken word is not for all of
[45:04] them but it is to them that we are
[45:07] known before the foundation
[45:10] of Praise the Lord they can all hear the
[45:14] word but they cannot apply the word they
[45:17] can all hear the spoken word but they
[45:20] cannot come into the experience of the
[45:22] life of the spoken
[45:25] words they cannot apply the
[45:28] praise the Living God so now we are
[45:31] talking about
[45:32] Exodus being a shadow of the three
[45:37] pools
[45:38] Exodus from egpt to
[45:42] can shadow of the three
[45:45] pools and now on the three
[45:47] pools showed them to the
[45:50] prophets to bring the people to
[45:53] believe praise the Lord God showed
[45:56] everything to the prophet of our
[45:58] day the same way he did it for
[46:02] Moses praise the Lord for Moses God gave
[46:06] him every
[46:08] instruction God revealed to Moses
[46:11] everything that God was going to
[46:14] do he did it why because God had
[46:19] entrusted
[46:21] Moses praise the Lord with the authority
[46:25] with the responsibility
[46:28] to bring the people out of Darkness to
[46:31] bring the people out of
[46:32] misery out of suffering out of Egypt to
[46:37] take them to their Promised Land praise
[46:40] the Lord and now the same way God gave
[46:43] the same
[46:45] instructions the prophet of Malachi
[46:47] chapter
[46:48] 4 he gave the same
[46:54] responsibility praise the Lord the
[46:57] spoken words he gave him the
[46:59] instructions to drive us out of
[47:02] Egypt to drive us out of Darkness to
[47:06] bring us into the countenance of the
[47:08] spoken
[47:10] words us out of Darkness out of sin to
[47:16] the promised land which is eternity so
[47:19] the same
[47:20] message has been given to Moses to drive
[47:24] the people from Egypt
[47:26] [Applause]
[47:28] is in the like man the same
[47:30] message that God gave
[47:33] unto to take us from from
[47:36] sin to the Rapture and now there is
[47:40] power in the spoken
[47:42] words and now I want us I want to say
[47:45] this this
[47:46] evening the word that God gave to to
[47:50] Mali
[47:53] chap that God gave to Prophet Elijah
[47:57] of our day he received the
[48:01] instructions he received the mind of God
[48:04] bring them to the people and when he was
[48:07] speaking he spoke to all the people
[48:11] prise the Lord and now not every person
[48:14] that received the spoken
[48:17] word believed it why this word isn't for
[48:23] all of them they in a mixed multitude
[48:27] in Egypt and this talken one differ
[48:31] shate the elect the child of God from
[48:35] the rest of the world prise the lord
[48:38] Moses spoke the word he said go and do
[48:42] it was in the
[48:44] open the Lord spoken
[48:47] word son was
[48:51] separating the
[48:52] believer the unbeliever praise the Lord
[48:56] spoken word but a
[48:59] separation separating us separating the
[49:04] SE separating the believer the elect of
[49:08] God from the rest of the world praise
[49:11] the Lord and now like I said on the
[49:13] three
[49:14] pools God still show the
[49:17] prophets what each of them would
[49:20] do praise the Lord like last like last
[49:24] Sunday the pastor quoted about the three
[49:28] pools he said something about the three
[49:31] pools praise the Lord and now the
[49:34] prophet spoke about in that message the
[49:37] anointed one at the end
[49:40] time
[49:42] first is healing the second pool is
[49:47] prophesying and the third pool is the
[49:51] word praise the Lord remember in
[49:54] Egypt God did mirac
[49:58] praise the Lord and those
[50:00] Miracles were to help make the people
[50:05] believe an
[50:07] attraction to attract the mind of the
[50:10] people to tell them there is something
[50:12] special
[50:14] here Lord to make them to believe their
[50:18] God remember most of them were born in
[50:22] that Strange
[50:23] Land and they didn't know their God
[50:27] so now whatever God did before
[50:30] Moses attract the
[50:32] people praise the Lord now the healing
[50:37] Services Prophet had those healing
[50:40] services and the Miracles that God
[50:43] did of Healing The Sick of raising the
[50:47] dead it was people to
[50:50] attention praise the Lord when when he
[50:53] prayed for you and you got healed it did
[50:56] not mean praise the Lord that you have
[50:59] received
[51:00] salvation that
[51:02] healing attract you to
[51:05] believe the that has healed you there
[51:09] something more to
[51:11] that something more to
[51:14] heal the Lord so it was the first pool
[51:18] and the second pool
[51:20] prophecy thus says the Lord praise the
[51:23] Lord so we shall look at that in details
[51:26] as we Su up our service so now we see
[51:29] that God revealed to the
[51:31] prophet all these pools and now in his
[51:36] ministry God gave him
[51:38] signs the same signs that he had given
[51:41] to
[51:41] Moses praise the Lord he gave him signs
[51:45] and now the first sign was also to make
[51:50] the people
[51:52] believe when the angel
[51:54] visited he says when you get the people
[51:57] to
[51:59] believe when you get the people to
[52:04] believe
[52:05] nothing shall stand before you not even
[52:10] canc praise the Lord now
[52:14] healing was one of the things that God
[52:16] was
[52:17] doing to let the people
[52:20] believe to come to this world praise the
[52:23] Lord but now healing is it not enough to
[52:28] prove that you you have
[52:30] salvation even the devil can
[52:35] impersonate praise the Lord the same way
[52:37] he
[52:38] impersonated the work of God in
[52:41] Egypt still imp personate the same we
[52:45] see many of them doing the
[52:47] same praise the Lord and now the two
[52:51] signs that we have given the
[52:54] prophet as we are going to see
[52:57] and as we have been told there was
[52:59] something more to the
[53:02] S praise the Lord say now when you get
[53:05] people to believe nothing shall stand
[53:08] before you and now he gave him two
[53:10] signs first the sign of
[53:14] vibration where he could hand touch the
[53:17] people he held their hands feel a
[53:21] vibration and now there was something
[53:24] around his hand
[53:26] hand could swell and when he felt the
[53:29] vibration he began to pray and when the
[53:32] vibration
[53:34] ceased the person healed and the person
[53:37] was instantly
[53:39] healed the Lord so the person who
[53:43] witnessed the vibration the person who
[53:46] witnessed the healing would be compelled
[53:49] to
[53:51] believe that William maram was preaching
[53:57] praise the Lord and he went ahead to
[53:58] give him the second
[54:00] sign which was the sign of
[54:03] discernment going down to the heart of
[54:05] the
[54:06] people reveal their heart
[54:09] condition calling men to
[54:11] repentance praise the Lord but this
[54:14] weren the Capone of his
[54:17] ministry this Wen the csone of his
[54:21] ministry one the climax of his
[54:24] ministry his ministry a
[54:27] message to prepare the
[54:30] people for the rupture praise the Lord
[54:34] so many people came we remember even
[54:37] during Jesus's time when Jesus was
[54:41] started his
[54:42] ministry he healed many people he made
[54:45] so many
[54:46] miracles praise the Lord and he could
[54:48] speak people's
[54:50] minds stand the people and of them came
[54:55] live because of what Jesus
[54:58] but there was more to the Miracles
[55:02] that he had to bring Salvation to the
[55:07] soul so he had to bring the
[55:10] words to the soul praise the
[55:15] Lord these two signs were not the climax
[55:19] of his
[55:21] ministry the Lord it had been nothing
[55:24] more than that
[55:26] praise the Lord now what was he to do he
[55:30] was to get the word the mind of God now
[55:35] bring to the people praise the Lord and
[55:38] he said on now this third
[55:41] occasion on the third pool which is not
[55:45] about prophecy which is not about
[55:48] healing praise the Lord he says God
[55:52] spoke to him and says
[55:56] now there is a third pool
[55:59] coming but don't try to explain
[56:03] it praise the Lord he says don't explain
[56:07] it why because the people could not see
[56:11] it and because the people could not see
[56:14] it with their
[56:15] eyes they were not to
[56:17] believe by seeing they not believe by
[56:21] touching but it was now the revelation
[56:24] of the word
[56:27] it was the word that was to be
[56:29] spoken itated word that was to be
[56:34] spoken heart now the third one was the
[56:38] heart
[56:40] condition was God speaking the mind to
[56:42] the heart of the
[56:44] people it was no longer healing was not
[56:48] prophesying now it was a heart
[56:52] condition praise the Lord it was the th
[56:54] say the Lord
[56:56] you believe it or you reject it or you
[57:00] reject it when Moses spoke the word some
[57:04] believed it and some rejected to those
[57:07] that believed it it was life and those
[57:11] that
[57:12] rejected it was
[57:14] death praise the Lord so now this third
[57:18] one we can't see it by our eyes we can't
[57:22] feel it by our
[57:24] sens is a heart condition
[57:27] prise the Lord is the word of
[57:30] God speaking to your
[57:32] heart a personal experience with the
[57:35] word of
[57:37] God no longer the
[57:40] sensations it's not about the
[57:43] prophecies but it is the word speaking
[57:46] to our hearts the word bringing us into
[57:50] knowledge of his
[57:52] words bringing us into his
[57:56] word praise the Lord where you are able
[58:01] to
[58:02] establish a personal relationship with
[58:06] him praise the lord we saw during
[58:09] Jesus's time he preached the gospel he
[58:12] healed the so many it but now when he
[58:17] began to
[58:18] preach when he began to bring the
[58:21] words spoken words speak their heart so
[58:26] many could not
[58:27] stand and so many went back and now he
[58:31] turn the rest of the TR say shall you
[58:34] also
[58:36] go praise the Lord now it was not
[58:39] Sensations it was not healing anymore it
[58:43] was the
[58:44] word praise the Lord it was the
[58:47] Revelation praise the Lord no wonder
[58:49] when he spoke and
[58:51] said unless you eat my
[58:53] flesh then they turned and said
[58:57] this man is here wi how can we eat his
[59:01] flesh how can he teach us to eat
[59:04] flesh praise the Lord and then said
[59:07] unless you drink my blood this man is a
[59:10] witch you are not expecting
[59:13] that expecting him to speak about
[59:16] healing to heal the sick make Miracles
[59:21] propes but now there was a turning point
[59:26] praise the Lord and this turning point
[59:29] was to call us to
[59:31] attention this turning point was to call
[59:34] the heart
[59:35] condition was to make a person
[59:39] Revelation each
[59:41] individual praise the Lord when he spoke
[59:45] some believed it why they had come into
[59:51] countenance they had come into the
[59:54] experience of the word of God he say
[59:58] don't explain
[59:59] it speak it and don't explain it why
[1:00:04] because they cannot believe it explain
[1:00:08] yourself they won't be able to believe
[1:00:11] it speak it it is now no longer the part
[1:00:14] of the
[1:00:15] Prophet now it was the part of God
[1:00:19] himself taking over his
[1:00:21] words and bringing his word to the
[1:00:24] people make himself known before the
[1:00:29] people have a personal experience with
[1:00:32] the
[1:00:34] people tell them let them get the
[1:00:38] lamb Slaughter it and put it up and put
[1:00:42] blood upon the L then the rest of them
[1:00:45] were like how will blood upon the
[1:00:49] L them from the death
[1:00:53] angelise the Lord but the people had a
[1:00:57] revelation was beyond the blood upon the
[1:01:00] L knew that this is a
[1:01:03] token God has given to us for our
[1:01:07] Salvation praise the Living God they
[1:01:10] believed it and applied it they were
[1:01:13] saved it was a point of
[1:01:16] discernment it was a point to prove them
[1:01:20] right or prove them wrong was a point of
[1:01:26] confusion before the enemy it was a
[1:01:29] point of
[1:01:33] confusion why he can impersonate
[1:01:36] everything
[1:01:37] else but he cannot impersonate the
[1:01:40] word praise the Lord that is a secret
[1:01:44] that is left only to the
[1:01:46] bright so when the spoken word
[1:01:50] goise the Lord the Bible says he has
[1:01:54] hidden this
[1:01:57] from the
[1:01:58] wise reveal
[1:02:01] them praise the Lord so when they spoken
[1:02:03] one
[1:02:05] go has hidden it from the rest of the
[1:02:08] world and he has revealed it only to the
[1:02:13] elect praise the Living God the rest of
[1:02:17] them won't be able to
[1:02:19] impersonate they can
[1:02:22] try they can try but at that point
[1:02:26] they fall short of it why they can never
[1:02:32] impersonate the word of God says don't
[1:02:36] explain it
[1:02:38] wasment piercing through the heart and
[1:02:41] mind of the people it is the word Christ
[1:02:45] making manifest in the body to the
[1:02:49] bright it is the word and the Bible
[1:02:52] calls it the
[1:02:53] word sharper
[1:02:56] than a two aged
[1:02:58] sword Lord going the int going through
[1:03:03] the mind and the hearts of the
[1:03:06] people cutting
[1:03:09] auning and pruning and
[1:03:11] pruning it finds an in our
[1:03:15] hearts so now it is
[1:03:18] Christ making himself known to the
[1:03:23] bride is Christ
[1:03:26] himself to the
[1:03:27] Bri and now Satan can't pull over this
[1:03:32] Revelation Satan can Ste this
[1:03:35] Revelation to make it known to his
[1:03:38] people it has be Christ and Christ Alone
[1:03:43] to make the word known to the people why
[1:03:45] told the prophet don't explain it it is
[1:03:50] my work speak the word I'll take the
[1:03:53] word and I'll make it know
[1:03:57] my people I make it known to them that
[1:04:02] we are
[1:04:03] predestinated the foundation of the word
[1:04:05] Jesus spoke and said in MTH 11:
[1:04:11] 2 at that time Jesus answered and
[1:04:14] said I thank the
[1:04:16] father Lord of
[1:04:19] Heaven Earth because thou Hast hid these
[1:04:23] things from the wise and prudent
[1:04:27] and them and
[1:04:29] babes even so
[1:04:31] father for so it seemed good in your
[1:04:35] sight all things are delivered unto me
[1:04:38] of my
[1:04:40] father and no man know the
[1:04:43] son but the father neither knowe any man
[1:04:47] the
[1:04:49] father and
[1:04:51] heever the son shall reveal him
[1:04:57] a person
[1:04:59] Revelation son Christ
[1:05:02] himself making himself
[1:05:05] revealed to the people making himself
[1:05:09] revealed to the elect he says God has
[1:05:12] hidden all
[1:05:14] the and revealed them only to
[1:05:17] the praise the Lord so he said no
[1:05:22] other no any other person
[1:05:26] not even any
[1:05:28] Prophet could reveal this to the people
[1:05:32] but the son
[1:05:34] himself so now this is a
[1:05:37] revelation the third
[1:05:40] pool Revelation is for the elect of God
[1:05:44] to receive to believe and come to
[1:05:48] knowledge of the mind of God for their
[1:05:51] day praise the lord we don't expect to
[1:05:54] see miracles
[1:05:56] we don't expect to see signs and
[1:06:00] wonders praise the Lord why a
[1:06:04] revelation it is a personal
[1:06:07] revelation a stage where
[1:06:10] Christ himself makes himself known to
[1:06:13] the
[1:06:16] personid he said no man knoweth the
[1:06:19] father except the son and no one knoweth
[1:06:22] the son except the father has revealed
[1:06:26] he said it is only the
[1:06:28] son that makes himself
[1:06:32] revealed those he called
[1:06:36] babes praise the Living God in First
[1:06:39] Corinthians
[1:06:42] 2:7 but we speak the wisdom of
[1:06:45] God in a
[1:06:47] mystery even the hidden
[1:06:50] wisdom which God ordained before the
[1:06:53] world
[1:06:55] our
[1:06:56] Glory which none of the princess of this
[1:06:59] world
[1:07:02] knew had they know know it they would
[1:07:06] not have crucified the Lord Of
[1:07:09] Glory but as it is
[1:07:11] written ey Has Not Seen Nor Ear
[1:07:15] heard neither have any enter neither
[1:07:18] have entered into the heart of
[1:07:22] man the things which God has prepared
[1:07:24] for
[1:07:27] things this
[1:07:28] message this spoken word is prepared for
[1:07:32] the
[1:07:33] Bri he says no ear has not
[1:07:38] heard and eye has not seen nether have
[1:07:42] entered into the heart of
[1:07:44] man the things which God has prepared
[1:07:46] for them that love
[1:07:48] him God has revealed them unto us by his
[1:07:53] spirit
[1:07:56] God has revealed his
[1:07:59] mind God has revealed his
[1:08:02] words by his Spirit through the prophet
[1:08:06] of
[1:08:07] Malachi for the Bri
[1:08:10] know right to come into the
[1:08:13] knowledge of the word that we come into
[1:08:17] that person
[1:08:19] experience with the spirit that person
[1:08:23] experience with the word
[1:08:26] praise the Lord it has to be the spirit
[1:08:28] of
[1:08:29] God it has to be Christ for the spirit
[1:08:32] sear as all
[1:08:34] things they things of
[1:08:38] God in the seven the prophet says
[1:08:41] remember Satan will try to
[1:08:44] impersonate he will try to impersonate
[1:08:46] everything that the church will
[1:08:48] do he tried to do it we've noticed it
[1:08:52] through the Antichrist
[1:08:55] this one this one thing he cannot
[1:08:59] impersonate there will be no mimics to
[1:09:02] this because he don't know it there is
[1:09:06] no way for him to know
[1:09:08] it it's the third PO he just knows
[1:09:12] nothing about it he doesn't understand
[1:09:15] it why because it is the revelation of
[1:09:18] the word and the says it's only
[1:09:22] Christ reveals it to us a heart
[1:09:26] condition praise the Lord Christ
[1:09:29] revealing his
[1:09:31] mind our heart individually not as a
[1:09:35] group it is
[1:09:38] individual as a group the enti group
[1:09:42] that was with Jesus when he spoke to
[1:09:44] them and said unless you eat my flesh
[1:09:47] and my
[1:09:49] blood the entire
[1:09:51] congregation would have remained but the
[1:09:54] rest of them left
[1:09:56] praise the Lord And now when he turned
[1:09:59] he looked at the
[1:10:00] disciples it was only left for the
[1:10:06] disciples why God had purposed
[1:10:09] that make himself
[1:10:12] known each of them it was a personal
[1:10:17] decision remain or to go in other words
[1:10:22] it is a personal affair
[1:10:26] man and
[1:10:27] God himself revealing himself to the
[1:10:31] people praise the Lord now at this time
[1:10:35] that's where we receive the
[1:10:37] word
[1:10:39] personally and believe the word
[1:10:43] personally and make a personal
[1:10:46] decision move with
[1:10:48] god with the word that voice when Christ
[1:10:53] comes down to reveal
[1:10:56] himself to us
[1:10:59] individually a
[1:11:01] confirmation that we are his and
[1:11:05] therefore nothing can take that word
[1:11:08] away
[1:11:09] from praise the Lord because the B says
[1:11:14] nothing can now separate us from that
[1:11:18] love which he has bested unto us when he
[1:11:22] loved us he made himself known to us
[1:11:26] and we have an affair with him an
[1:11:29] individual affair with him come to that
[1:11:33] experience nothing can separate us from
[1:11:37] that love praise the Lord and Pa it not
[1:11:41] even not even
[1:11:43] sickness not even hunger completely
[1:11:47] nothing not things present not things to
[1:11:50] come nothing can separate you the man
[1:11:54] has come
[1:11:56] knew that person
[1:11:58] experience the word of God praise the
[1:12:01] Lord and says and just then he picked me
[1:12:05] up he took me up and set set me up on
[1:12:10] high to where a meeting was going
[1:12:13] on it is a vision and the prophet
[1:12:16] speaking and said look like a t to a
[1:12:18] cathedal of some
[1:12:22] sort and I looked and there was a little
[1:12:27] like little place over in
[1:12:30] the over in the
[1:12:32] S and I seen that light was was talking
[1:12:36] to somebody above
[1:12:39] me that light that you see there on the
[1:12:45] picture it w away from me like that and
[1:12:49] went over to that
[1:12:51] tent and said I'll meet you there
[1:12:56] and said this will be the third Po and
[1:13:00] you won't tell it to
[1:13:02] nobody and in Sabo Canyon he
[1:13:06] said this is the third pool and there is
[1:13:10] three great things that goes with
[1:13:13] it and one unfolded today or
[1:13:17] yesterday other unfolded today and
[1:13:21] there's one thing that I cannot
[1:13:24] interpret because it is unknown
[1:13:27] language I was standing right there I
[1:13:31] looked
[1:13:32] right straight at it and this is the
[1:13:36] third coming
[1:13:38] up and the Holy Spirit of God that is
[1:13:41] the reason all heaven was
[1:13:44] silent and he said he could not
[1:13:46] interpret
[1:13:47] it the
[1:13:49] Revelation personal
[1:13:52] engagement the revelation of the words
[1:13:55] that Christ has to take by
[1:13:58] himself and brings to the heart brings
[1:14:01] to the soul praise the Lord to have a
[1:14:04] personal
[1:14:06] experience with God himself so now back
[1:14:09] to the
[1:14:10] Exodus God put this
[1:14:14] responsibility upon Moses to take them
[1:14:16] people out of Egypt to
[1:14:19] can God put this
[1:14:22] parden upon Moses to take the
[1:14:26] people all from
[1:14:28] Egypt through the Wilderness to Canan
[1:14:33] and Moses was just like one of
[1:14:37] them just an elevated brother to carry
[1:14:40] the
[1:14:42] burden praise the Lord and now we notice
[1:14:46] that many times the burden became heavy
[1:14:49] for Moses
[1:14:51] to and sometimes he could he could cry
[1:14:56] when the people's
[1:14:58] needs became so much for him to
[1:15:02] handle bur pushed him in a
[1:15:05] corner and he became helpless many
[1:15:09] times praise the Lord but as a minister
[1:15:13] He Could
[1:15:14] Cry Praise the Lord for the burdens of
[1:15:17] the people and he could run to God said
[1:15:21] God what must I do what must I speak to
[1:15:24] the
[1:15:25] people praise the Lord and when the
[1:15:28] people could not understand Moses
[1:15:31] position because all
[1:15:33] they to have their needs attended
[1:15:36] to so they knew nothing of what Moses
[1:15:39] was going
[1:15:40] through each time they got a burden they
[1:15:44] throw it before the eyes of Moses each
[1:15:46] time they had a need to bring it to
[1:15:50] Moses and say it is your
[1:15:52] responsibility because he said God told
[1:15:56] youing us from Egypt and taking us to
[1:15:59] Canan now here is our need so now they
[1:16:03] used to attack him they could insult him
[1:16:07] they thought he wasn't human like
[1:16:10] them mes was a human that God simply
[1:16:14] used move them through the Exodus to the
[1:16:18] promised land praise the Lord and I want
[1:16:20] to Echo something here like I said last
[1:16:24] week
[1:16:25] that this Minister Moses is a human who
[1:16:29] is carrying our burdens praise the Lord
[1:16:32] this man Moses is a human that was
[1:16:36] carrying all their
[1:16:37] needs praise the Lord and Moses could
[1:16:41] not live his
[1:16:43] life praise the Lord he was living the
[1:16:46] life of the
[1:16:47] people because without him that people
[1:16:51] would not
[1:16:52] move his mind Serve the People all the
[1:16:57] time think of how they shall move
[1:17:00] through the world how they shall come
[1:17:02] out of Egypt they shall cross Red
[1:17:06] Sea praise the Lord and the people never
[1:17:10] Rec
[1:17:11] organized the position of Moses they
[1:17:15] never organized how
[1:17:18] bur for him to carry praise the Lord so
[1:17:22] now they reached the time
[1:17:25] praise the Lord they came to a
[1:17:28] point they were
[1:17:30] thirsty and when they were thirsty they
[1:17:33] came to Moses they were at Mar and the
[1:17:37] waters there were bit and not t of it
[1:17:41] they turn to Moses and says give us
[1:17:45] water give us
[1:17:47] water need we want to take water I want
[1:17:51] liken this the Ministers of today I want
[1:17:55] like Moses's service the ministry today
[1:18:00] praise the lord we go to
[1:18:02] God and often kneel down and pray and
[1:18:06] say God this is my desire bless me with
[1:18:11] this God this is my heart condition put
[1:18:15] me out of sin put me out of this of
[1:18:19] iniquity and now God pulls it over and
[1:18:23] takes it the minister
[1:18:25] praise the Lord because you can't
[1:18:27] understand it unless maybe you've been
[1:18:31] rebuked so now all our prayers all our
[1:18:35] cries all our
[1:18:37] AB throw them to God throw them to the
[1:18:40] minister and gives him the burden to go
[1:18:44] and lighten the burden of the
[1:18:46] people praise the Lord that's what Moses
[1:18:49] was going through they said we want
[1:18:52] water they could not turn anywhere and
[1:18:55] they turn to him and now Moses also
[1:18:58] turned to
[1:18:59] God God what shall I do the people are
[1:19:03] thirsting and they crying and they
[1:19:07] insulting then God revealed him God
[1:19:10] spoke to him Moses go and do this praise
[1:19:14] the Lord and then Moses came
[1:19:17] and and they were very happen but they
[1:19:20] didn't know the pressure that Moses was
[1:19:23] going came up and drink drank the
[1:19:27] water quench their thirst then they
[1:19:31] moved again they
[1:19:33] reached says in in the of
[1:19:37] sin again they became
[1:19:39] thirsty stand against Moses and again
[1:19:42] they rebuked him Moses cried God and
[1:19:47] they forgot that at some
[1:19:50] point they sin before God and when they
[1:19:54] sin
[1:19:56] it took Moses to stand in between and
[1:20:00] plead for God forgive their we remember
[1:20:05] when Moses had gone to
[1:20:07] mount received the Commandments when
[1:20:10] they were here
[1:20:12] impatient they pulled
[1:20:15] over and came to Aon and fored him that
[1:20:19] they could have a goat wash and then he
[1:20:22] allowed it and they made a golden
[1:20:26] remember when Moses came down God was
[1:20:29] very Furious was going Smite all of
[1:20:32] them but Moses God had instructed him
[1:20:37] these are my people put them from Egypt
[1:20:41] to Canan your responsibility so Moses
[1:20:44] had to stand in
[1:20:45] between he had to plead with God he
[1:20:49] interceded and he prayed must upon them
[1:20:54] he prayed night
[1:20:55] have and reminded them these are your
[1:20:58] people serve them this is my
[1:21:02] church
[1:21:04] conation G
[1:21:09] away upon them forgive them he was
[1:21:13] praying for them he was carrying their
[1:21:17] AB praise the Lord so that they could
[1:21:20] appear where before God
[1:21:25] was upon was put upon Moses it was put
[1:21:29] upon the minister to carry the burdens
[1:21:32] of the people and
[1:21:35] nowesh again became thirsty there was no
[1:21:39] water there was no River it was a rock
[1:21:43] the burden again came back to
[1:21:45] Moses and they went to him and said we
[1:21:48] want
[1:21:49] water and they were very
[1:21:52] angry and they were putting him to the
[1:21:56] and he was crying out to God and he
[1:21:59] cried out to God and when he cried to
[1:22:02] God in the book of
[1:22:04] [Applause]
[1:22:05] numbers from around
[1:22:08] verse3 praise the Lord God spoke to
[1:22:11] Moses and he gave him an instruction he
[1:22:15] says don't
[1:22:16] cry go and speak to the
[1:22:19] Rock praise the Lord the burdens of the
[1:22:22] people made him to to cry and now when
[1:22:26] God had his cry he was crying in his
[1:22:30] closet crying to God
[1:22:33] and are too much people are
[1:22:37] angry angry with
[1:22:39] me
[1:22:42] of what I do give me what I'll show to
[1:22:47] them and God told him this time is not
[1:22:51] the
[1:22:52] road this time it is the spoken word go
[1:22:57] speak to the Rock praise the Lord and
[1:23:00] when you speak the rock water will come
[1:23:04] out and people will fetch and people
[1:23:07] will drink praise the Lord now we see
[1:23:10] two things there we see the spoken words
[1:23:14] and the manifestation of the spoken
[1:23:16] words praise the Lord the
[1:23:19] word says the Lord speak to the Rock
[1:23:24] upon the Lord vindicate the word so that
[1:23:28] water could come out but because of the
[1:23:31] pressure of the people maybe when Moses
[1:23:34] came out they could not allow him to do
[1:23:39] what God had instructed him to so they
[1:23:43] pushing him pushing so he became angry
[1:23:47] praise the Lord because he was human
[1:23:50] then he got the road again and he struck
[1:23:53] The Rock T and water came out that's not
[1:23:57] what God had asked
[1:23:59] him but because of the pressure of the
[1:24:02] people he was compelled to do
[1:24:06] it the burden of the church the burden
[1:24:10] of the people upon the ministers they
[1:24:14] had
[1:24:14] forgotten he was human too and they were
[1:24:19] impatient wait upon the will of
[1:24:22] God sometimes when we have need we lay
[1:24:26] them before God even speak the pastor
[1:24:30] and he prays for us and they pray over
[1:24:32] us and they say go
[1:24:35] believeing God will grant it let's be
[1:24:38] patient praise the Lord sometimes
[1:24:41] we and we are pushing pushing to the
[1:24:44] pastor and the pastor somehow has not
[1:24:48] gotten time maybe to visit over or maybe
[1:24:52] to come and pray for you
[1:24:55] praise the lord we shouldn't become
[1:24:58] angry we should pray for them the people
[1:25:03] we prayed for Moses Moses would come in
[1:25:07] the same mind of
[1:25:09] God tell the people what God has said
[1:25:13] and maybe would speak the Rock and The
[1:25:16] Rock would bring water but he came and
[1:25:19] compelling him pulling him he struck the
[1:25:22] Rock and what happened
[1:25:25] God became angry
[1:25:27] with and God told him it's true the
[1:25:31] burden of these people upon your back
[1:25:35] and have given them over to you but this
[1:25:37] that you have done this is not a I told
[1:25:40] you I gave you the spoken
[1:25:43] words go and
[1:25:45] speak go and speak this time it was at
[1:25:50] Kadesh it was a different environment
[1:25:54] praise the Lord God wanted to
[1:25:58] manifest God wanted to vindicate his
[1:26:01] word said go and speak the words
[1:26:05] remember Moses had done this before he
[1:26:08] had spoken flies
[1:26:10] into there spoken so many things into
[1:26:14] existence in Egypt and this time because
[1:26:18] of the burden of the people and because
[1:26:21] his soul was overwhelmed
[1:26:24] he short of it and instead he struck the
[1:26:29] rock burdens of the people upon the
[1:26:33] minister we pray that God may give our
[1:26:36] ministers
[1:26:37] Grace to to his
[1:26:40] word take the spoken word delivered unto
[1:26:44] them to bring them to us because we know
[1:26:48] that the mind of
[1:26:50] God perfect for us praise the Lord so
[1:26:54] now
[1:26:55] Moses came short of that God said you
[1:26:59] will not drive them from
[1:27:01] here you will not enter
[1:27:04] can you will not enter Canan why he did
[1:27:08] not speak the
[1:27:09] word he did not speak the word and God
[1:27:13] wanted to manifest his word and this is
[1:27:15] what the prophet says about God wanted
[1:27:19] Moses to have faith that he had put in
[1:27:26] the Fai that he had put
[1:27:27] in in the gift that he had
[1:27:32] clearly God clearly proved
[1:27:35] Moses and the people that it was
[1:27:38] him by the word and by the things that
[1:27:41] was
[1:27:42] said come to pass it was clearly
[1:27:46] identified there was no need of him
[1:27:49] worrying anymore about
[1:27:51] it there no more of him thinking
[1:27:53] anything about
[1:27:56] was clearly cleared
[1:27:58] up he had already done
[1:28:01] things and he had already proved by
[1:28:04] flies and
[1:28:06] fleas and
[1:28:08] fleas and he spoke things into
[1:28:12] creation and the word of God was in
[1:28:16] him so he is going to ask now what to
[1:28:20] do when the circumstances Lays right
[1:28:24] before
[1:28:25] him and he says I hope this goes way
[1:28:28] down to
[1:28:29] us and we see where we are
[1:28:32] at don't it make you feel about that
[1:28:37] big don't Don't It Make You Feel big
[1:28:41] about
[1:28:42] it think about mesing his
[1:28:47] fault and look talk about his
[1:28:52] faults look at our
[1:28:55] he yeah here he was standing there KN
[1:29:00] that the scriptures said that was the
[1:29:02] hour and the day for for that to
[1:29:07] happen God had met him in a pill of fire
[1:29:11] and it went right down before the people
[1:29:13] and performed these things and
[1:29:16] everything he said it came to pass even
[1:29:19] to bring things into
[1:29:20] creation and here was the circumstance
[1:29:24] with the people that he was raising
[1:29:28] up bring the promised
[1:29:31] land and then was standing
[1:29:35] crying what must I do that's a human
[1:29:40] being as a as brother Roy
[1:29:44] Slaughter I believe he's standing
[1:29:47] outside the door told me one time about

[1:30:12] them and that's just the way human
[1:30:14] beings
[1:30:15] is lean on your shoulder
[1:30:18] today tomorrow you P them that is it
[1:30:22] that's what Moses was was doing
[1:30:25] God had to pack him along after he
[1:30:27] ordained him and proved it to do
[1:30:32] it and the people to have
[1:30:35] said Moses say the word I seen you do it
[1:30:40] there God honed you there God honored
[1:30:44] you
[1:30:45] there praise the Lord he said the people
[1:30:47] would have said Moses speak the word we
[1:30:53] saw you doing
[1:30:54] there God honed you there and you are
[1:30:58] the same one
[1:30:59] today amen see do it amen he ought to
[1:31:05] have know it but he didn't all right
[1:31:08] just as it was
[1:31:11] did so it is
[1:31:13] now we find out that so he
[1:31:18] said God must just got enough of it
[1:31:24] God must have got fed up on
[1:31:27] it he says why are you crying to me
[1:31:31] about haven't I already Pro proved my
[1:31:35] identification haven't I told you that I
[1:31:37] sent you for for for the
[1:31:40] job to do this I promise that I will do
[1:31:45] this and I be I be with your
[1:31:48] mouth I would speak through you and I
[1:31:51] would do this and you show signs and
[1:31:55] wonders I promise do this have not I did
[1:31:59] just
[1:32:01] exactly destroyed every enemy from
[1:32:04] around
[1:32:05] you and here you are standing out
[1:32:09] now the Red Sea right the line of duty
[1:32:14] what I told you to do then stilling and
[1:32:18] crying to
[1:32:19] me don't you believe me but Moses was
[1:32:22] crying
[1:32:24] because of the burdens of the people God
[1:32:27] was proving to him that yes I chose you
[1:32:30] and I gave you my word I will be your
[1:32:34] mouthpie you speak the word and I will
[1:32:37] do it God was ready to vindicate the
[1:32:42] words that Moses was speak it was now
[1:32:46] God
[1:32:46] himself the role of
[1:32:49] Moses was speak the role of the prophet
[1:32:52] of Malachi
[1:32:55] was to
[1:32:56] speak what God has given him to
[1:32:59] speak praise the Lord it was not his
[1:33:02] duty whether the people at that time
[1:33:06] were to believe him or not praise the
[1:33:09] Lord he had done the
[1:33:11] Miracles done the
[1:33:13] prophesy and now this time was the time
[1:33:16] for him to speak the
[1:33:19] words upon God himself take a hold of
[1:33:23] his word
[1:33:25] make to believe his
[1:33:26] words the Lord the prophet says Moses I
[1:33:31] I told you I am your
[1:33:34] mouthpiece oh that is very sweet to hear
[1:33:38] God spoke and said I am your
[1:33:41] mouth so when we see the
[1:33:44] minister praise the Lord speaking the
[1:33:47] word to us that's not his words it's a
[1:33:52] mouthpiece speaking what God has
[1:33:56] ordained prise the Lord when the prophet
[1:33:58] came to preach when he spoke the words
[1:34:02] that was not
[1:34:04] speaking that was God speaking the
[1:34:08] El speak the words don't explain it
[1:34:12] speak it I'll take it because I said in
[1:34:16] the words it is upon me to reveal
[1:34:20] it the babes
[1:34:23] those that have been
[1:34:26] predestinated Moses speak why do you cry
[1:34:32] speak and I will do it and when you hear
[1:34:36] this the prophet said when he was in
[1:34:39] that Vision prise the Lord And now when
[1:34:42] when when God had showed him the first
[1:34:45] one the first pool now he saw the second
[1:34:48] one and the third one he told him don't
[1:34:53] explain it why it's not a man's work
[1:34:59] anymore it is now upon the
[1:35:02] Lord the Bible
[1:35:04] says says The
[1:35:07] Battle Belongs to Me praise the Lord now
[1:35:12] it is now a
[1:35:13] battle it is a matter of the
[1:35:16] heart it is a matter of the Soul it is
[1:35:20] now speaking salvation to the heart
[1:35:24] it's not about the Miracles Miracles are
[1:35:27] good praise the Lord but now at that
[1:35:30] point the speaking of the words there is
[1:35:34] no Miracle there is God himself to take
[1:35:38] the word praise the Lord and make
[1:35:40] himself known to the
[1:35:42] people speak it and don't explain it why
[1:35:47] it is now my duty the angel
[1:35:50] himself made angel the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:55] himself come upon the
[1:35:57] scene to take up the message
[1:36:00] of take it it from
[1:36:03] [Applause]
[1:36:04] will says now you're going to speak and
[1:36:07] when you speak don't explain it I will
[1:36:11] take it myself and I will make them no
[1:36:14] this Tru I make them believe this truth
[1:36:19] I make them know that this is the truth
[1:36:22] and I'll make
[1:36:24] Mind Of
[1:36:27] God known to them speak it don't add
[1:36:32] explanation praise the Lord and that's
[1:36:34] what we are also doing we get the word
[1:36:38] because the prophet says speak what he
[1:36:41] spoke so we get the words and we speak
[1:36:45] to the people praise the Lord out of our
[1:36:48] powers to make the people believe it but
[1:36:52] when we speak it because it's the word
[1:36:54] of God God takes a hold of it and he
[1:36:58] makes
[1:36:59] himself known to the people praise the
[1:37:03] Lord he make
[1:37:05] himself revealed to the
[1:37:08] people he said I heard it but I can't
[1:37:12] speak it because it was in un unknown
[1:37:16] language it was
[1:37:18] hidden God only that must make it known
[1:37:24] each one of us and we are such a blessed
[1:37:27] people praise the Lord that when we
[1:37:29] heard that word regardless of whether it
[1:37:32] was in Unown
[1:37:34] language when you heard it it is very
[1:37:39] hard very hard for you to take it but
[1:37:43] somehow you found Grace to receive it
[1:37:48] and believe that it is the
[1:37:50] truth it is out of your powers to
[1:37:54] believe that this is the
[1:37:55] truth that is a
[1:37:58] personal
[1:38:01] encounter with Christ himself making
[1:38:04] himself known to the
[1:38:06] people praise the living Bo so now at
[1:38:09] that point God ask Moses to
[1:38:13] speak he wanted himself to let the
[1:38:16] people see because all along told Moses
[1:38:21] get your road go and do this
[1:38:24] get your Ro go and do this and people
[1:38:26] were seeing that Moses was doing
[1:38:29] it seeing Miracles
[1:38:31] Miracles time God wanted it to be the
[1:38:36] spoken
[1:38:37] word speak the word and I'll make it
[1:38:41] manifest speak the word if Moses had
[1:38:44] spoken the word he would speak the
[1:38:47] word God could get the word God could
[1:38:51] get that word have gotten the what when
[1:38:54] Moses spoke to the Rock and God could
[1:38:58] make a manifestation of
[1:39:01] himself he could have made the
[1:39:07] manifestation the Lord cause the water
[1:39:10] to flow
[1:39:13] out
[1:39:14] believe would see
[1:39:17] that because God had
[1:39:20] spoken praise the Lord what a
[1:39:24] lesson what a
[1:39:26] lesson oh my at this stage of the
[1:39:30] journey where we are standing look where
[1:39:33] we are right now yes sir at the third
[1:39:38] one we are right here at the door of the
[1:39:42] coming of the Lord he was anointed for
[1:39:44] the
[1:39:46] job and still waiting for thus says the
[1:39:49] Lord God must just have got enough of it
[1:39:55] don't cry any
[1:39:58] more speak I sent you oh God what this
[1:40:04] church ought be this
[1:40:06] morning God perfect
[1:40:10] Vindication with the pillar of fire and
[1:40:13] the signs and
[1:40:14] wonders and everything just like it was
[1:40:17] in the days of
[1:40:19] Sodom he said it would return right back
[1:40:23] praise the Lord just like he spoke to
[1:40:25] Moses and says go and speak the words go
[1:40:29] and tell the people this is what they
[1:40:31] going to
[1:40:32] do let them simply apply the blood and
[1:40:36] the rest of it shall be upon me the same
[1:40:39] voice of God because we know that he's
[1:40:42] the
[1:40:43] same yesterday and forever the same
[1:40:47] voice that spoke to
[1:40:48] Moses the same voice that has spoken to
[1:40:51] us praise the Lord
[1:40:53] the same voice that has called us to
[1:40:56] attention that has called us to the
[1:40:59] light that has called us to believe the
[1:41:03] Spoken Word of Our Praise the Lord and
[1:41:06] God is so gracious praise the Lord that
[1:41:10] he got a hold of this spoken
[1:41:12] word and he made it known to us that we
[1:41:16] can know the mind of
[1:41:17] God for our day and he has hidden it
[1:41:22] from the rest of the world
[1:41:24] and made it only
[1:41:25] known to us the babes elected the
[1:41:31] predestinated blessed
[1:41:35] be blessed be the god father of our
[1:41:38] Jesus
[1:41:39] Christ who has blessed us with all
[1:41:43] Heavenly
[1:41:45] blessings in Christ Jesus praise the
[1:41:48] lord we who he for you has he
[1:41:54] predestinated Us Praise the Lord has he
[1:41:58] prepared
[1:41:59] us has he adopted
[1:42:02] us two children that we can hear the
[1:42:06] spoken words believe the spoken words
[1:42:10] apply the spoken word praise the Lord it
[1:42:13] is a blessing to the elect praise the
[1:42:16] Lord so now the first pool is healing
[1:42:20] praise the Lord just like the prophet
[1:42:22] said
[1:42:23] it does not mean that there is no more
[1:42:26] healing no praise the lord we can still
[1:42:30] FAL and ask God to heal Us Praise the
[1:42:34] Lord but like I said in my text that The
[1:42:38] Exodus is a shadow of the three
[1:42:41] pools when God visited Moses in the
[1:42:45] buring bush he told him I have a
[1:42:49] covenanted
[1:42:51] people got a covenant
[1:42:54] which I made with
[1:42:55] Abraham with
[1:42:57] andac over years ago and now it is time
[1:43:02] that I'm coming to honor my Covenant
[1:43:06] prise the Lord so regardless of the
[1:43:08] condition of the
[1:43:10] people they had been
[1:43:12] Justified because God had made a
[1:43:15] promise Abraham and now he comes down
[1:43:19] and tells
[1:43:20] Moses bring them out when he brought
[1:43:23] them out all through the
[1:43:26] Wilderness they went through
[1:43:30] sanctification the people went through
[1:43:32] so many
[1:43:34] troubles they went so many
[1:43:37] chastisements each time they
[1:43:40] rejected
[1:43:43] subjected and he
[1:43:46] justed he brought them back to the W
[1:43:49] praise the Lord And now when they reach
[1:43:51] Kadesh
[1:43:53] tells them pick out a few of them I want
[1:43:57] them to go and enter into can I want
[1:44:02] them to go and see what the land looks
[1:44:05] like praise the Lord and when they went
[1:44:08] there they could come back to Give A tes
[1:44:11] and the same thing when God had given
[1:44:14] the word you know it could have been
[1:44:18] mes who could have entered into the into
[1:44:21] into can to go see what is there but
[1:44:25] because of what had
[1:44:26] happened told him you're not going to
[1:44:28] cross
[1:44:29] over so thankful to God that he allowed
[1:44:33] our Prophet praise the Lord when he
[1:44:36] brought us out when he gave us the
[1:44:39] message to bring us out of of the world
[1:44:43] and now when we went through the the
[1:44:45] sanctification
[1:44:47] process which we go through every day
[1:44:50] God allowed the prophets to go be the C
[1:44:54] of go and see what is
[1:44:57] there praise the Lord he pulled him over
[1:45:01] and he open the curtain and he took him
[1:45:03] in so he could be able to see what is
[1:45:08] there get a testimony and then he got
[1:45:11] there he saw those brothers and
[1:45:15] sisters died
[1:45:18] way when they
[1:45:20] old when he saw them they were young in
[1:45:23] the youthful
[1:45:24] stage and each of them was happy and he
[1:45:28] saw Serene
[1:45:29] environment and he was very
[1:45:31] happy allowed him to go and see so he
[1:45:36] brings back A tes for us as a witness
[1:45:41] praise the Lord and now God allowed a
[1:45:44] few of
[1:45:45] them including Josh
[1:45:47] [Applause]
[1:45:50] andoss to goise
[1:45:53] they could go and get a w a
[1:45:56] witness so they could come over and
[1:45:59] bring a testimony we are so thankful to
[1:46:02] God that whatever thing that God wants
[1:46:06] us to know has put down the scriptures
[1:46:10] we are so thankful to
[1:46:12] God also
[1:46:14] revealed his word to Us Praise the Lord
[1:46:18] so we know who we are we are the elect

[1:46:35] he calls us the elect he calls us the
[1:46:40] predestinated he calls us the adopted
[1:46:43] children the Lord they have been set
[1:46:46] aside waiting upon him for the
[1:46:51] rupture praise the Lord Moses pulled
[1:46:53] them over and when he reached there did
[1:46:57] not enter in Praise the Lord as in for
[1:47:00] us when he pull us over the same
[1:47:05] Minister same messenger that he used to
[1:47:09] deliver unto us the spoken words he
[1:47:13] allowed him to still cross over and go
[1:47:16] and test praise the Lord of that eternal
