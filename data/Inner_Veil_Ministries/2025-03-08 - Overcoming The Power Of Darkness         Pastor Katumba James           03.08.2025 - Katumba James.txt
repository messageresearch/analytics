You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I'm happy to be here in the house of the Lord. The week has been so busy for me from when I've been preaching every day and he has just been the grace of God and I've been going to different places on Wednesday we had a service here then I had an online service again that same day on Thursday I was in Palisa Then on Friday I was in yesterday I was in. Thank God I'm here this morning. Praise the name of our Lord. So it's always just the grace of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Sometimes I always wonder can I move out with those fields? But I'm praying the Lord raise some people. Praise the name of our lord so much engaged in their work and you can't you can't tell them leave your work. Praise the name of our lord but there is a lot of need outside like for the places I was in over the last three days. I was last there in November last year. But this time when I went there, people were really weak, [Music] very weak that you had to go back almost at the beginning. So we just need to keep on praying for one another that the grace of God may continue to work in the whole body of Jesus Christ. There's a brother called Rogers from Canongu. You can raise your hand. Yes. Stand up. You're welcome. Our brother. We're happy to have you around. You may sit back. You may sit back. It's okay. Thank you for being with us. He came all the way from and the zeal of the Lord he has is very interesting. last Sunday, last stand of Friday last week, he called me and then he was meant to come but he was held up by his work and it is strange how we started landing our radio programs. So he he has been listening to them and that's how he knew that there was a church around. So he called me this morning and by 8:00 I believe he was around. Praise the name of our Lord. So I welcome our brother to be with us. Praise the name of our Lord. I see brother weekly. You can stand up for recognition. We welcome you. He was with us here about last year and before last year. He was also doing a course at Campal International University Medical School. [Music] Now he works in as a medical doctor I believe. So you're welcome to be with us, brother. And then I see brother Mike, you're also welcome. You've just reached in. Welcome. We're happy to be with you today. And then other visitors coming here for the first time, just raise your hand. I believe we are not so much strangers and I'm very grateful brother that from the time he brought the children for dedication he doesn't leave them back home praise the name of our lord and even others we can pick up the same leaf that you know we can always come with our families to worship the lord Praise the name of the Lord. Our pastor is not around and part of his family. They went to minister in May today. Just keep them in your prayers. Praise the name of our Lord. Then on 24th, that's this month of August, we were meant to have brother Tim, but he's not coming. But instead we have another visiting minister. He's called brother Franklin George. George. &gt;&gt; He comes from Ibadan Ibadan &gt;&gt; in Nigeria. &gt;&gt; Nigeria. &gt;&gt; He's going to be with us for the whole month. He's reaching on Saturday. So you can imagine how busy we are going to get to be. Praise the name of our Lord. So next Sunday we'll be preaching in Pastor S's church. I'll be traveling with him there. So pastor will be preaching here on Sunday. Then on Wednesday we'll be going to then from there we take him to Campala. Then he will be at brother Kabasi's church on 15th and 17th. Then from there I'll go to brother Gideon's church in he will come back. Then on Friday that will be 22nd you'll be preaching in brother SA's church and on Friday also that time we shall we would require to go and be with that service in Kacha Friday 22nd then on 24th we'll be preaching here and then again to other places after that praise the name of our Lord. So my prayer is our young men should come up. [Music] Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, you can imagine having that vis around. There's a lot of movement, but then you find that you're the one to move with him. Praise the name of our Lord. So I'm praying more young men to rise up with their resources to serve the kingdom of God. Praise the name of our Lord because the burden is big and we need to reach out and see that we support the work of the king. Praise the name of our Lord. So today we have two services and then we have the Lord's supper starting at 5. Before we go, let me invite the youth song. [Music] I'm using my Bible for a road map. Ten commandments they tell me what to do. The 12 disciples are my road signs and Jesus will take me safely through. Oh, there will be no deta [Music] along the way. I'm using my Bible for a road map.

Praise the name of our Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yesterday morning I was praying And I already got thought I thought I would preach today. I'd already got what to preach on Friday night. Yesterday, I think it was around 4:00 in the morning or three when I was praying the Lord put upon my heart to come and preach about overcoming the power of darkness. So the Lord is passing your way this morning. Amen. Let us sing that song. &gt;&gt; It's just a blessing because that's the very song we started the service with. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Father, to deliver everyone in their captivity, to set everyone free, heavenly Lord, to heal the sick, Lord. Fill your children with your spirit. to open the eyes of the blind. Make the lame walk. Make the deaf fear alone. You are the same God we want to thank you for. May you speak to us through your word. Maness yourself in our lives and help us in the name of Jesus Christ that we may have a personal relationship and walk with you Lord. Bless us father. May we rejoice in your presence. We're also praying for our pastor and his members in May. Lord, may you use him for your glory, Father, that your purpose and will may be done in those meetings. Bless us all together today, Lord. We love you and we thank you, Father. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us turn to Acts chapter 26. Acts chapter 26 we're reading from verse 18 rather verse 16 up to verse 18 the Bible says but rise and stand upon thy feet for I've appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of the things which thou hast seen and of the things which in which I will appear unto thee. delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I now send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light. and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive the forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. of his word. You may become. So our text is overcoming the power of darkness. Praise the name of our Lord. Overcoming the power of darkness. And you know sin itself is darkness. Praise the name of our Lord. Sin is darkness and anything associated with sin is darkness. Sickness came because of sin. So it also reflected as darkness. Unbelief is darkness. Doubt is darkness. Praise the name of the Lord. And so we find that as we live here, &gt;&gt; darkness gets a hold of us or in the first place. We were born in sin and then shaped in iniquity. Our first birth made us sinners by nature. Praise the name of our Lord. Brother, you're welcome. Praise the name of our Lord. So our first birth made us sinners by nature. You know you were born a sinner. Like an example you find a small child licking sugar and then you ask him why have you taken that sugar? He start denying while wiping them. It's just a nature, you know, something that you know is in you. That's why we need the second birth. That's why we need to be born again. When you are born again, then the spirit of God comes down in your life. Praise the name of Lord. And then it changes your nature. You become a new creation, a creation after righteousness. Our first birth is a creation after unrighteousness. It's a creation after doing wickedness. It's a creation of a rebellious kind of nature. And you see, when you accept the Lord Jesus as your personal savior, You are denying darkness. You are coming out of darkness and then what the Lord first does to your life, he justifies you. Praise the name of our Lord. In other words, he's saying that whatever you have done in the past forgiven you, but then in you, you still have a desire to do wrong. You still have a nature to do wrong. So then he takes you sanctification. In other words, to separate you from those things which are not right and then he fills you with the Holy Spirit which is his own creation which is his own new creation. And now when he filled with the Holy Spirit, then the Holy Spirit starts to take charge over your human spirit. You know what the Bible tells us in Romans chapter 8. in Romans chapter 8 and then we can get in verse 16. He says, "The spirit itself bears witness with our human spirit that we are the children of God." Because your human spirit, you get it up here on earth to enable this body operate. And now your human spirit has all the time been subject to the spirit of the world. From the time you were born, your human spirit was held captive by the spirit of the world, which is the spirit of the devil. So then the devil influence your human spirit because of your nature into the things that are contrary to God. Praise the name of Lord. But now when you accept the Lord Jesus as your personal savior, And then you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Then the bapt the Holy Ghost takes over your human spirit. You know the Bible tells us that a man that is alive cannot influence himself. We can pick that scripture in Jeremiah chapter 10. Jeremiah chapter 10. And then we read in verse 23, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Oh Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself. It is not in man that walketh to direct his steps." He says it's not in us to direct yourself. So there has to be an influence that takes a hold of your life that will guide you that will direct you. Now when we are born in our first birth, Satan takes a hold of our human soul and then he makes you do whatever you want to do because the world is full of sin. You may find that even the home where you're being raised up, it's all wickedness that is done, the community where you live, immorality that is done. And then brother Brandham says that rock and roll they will take a hold of any child spirit. It doesn't matter. It's only the new birth that can deliver from that kind of thing totally easily influenced. That's why the Bible says that you know in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 praise the name of our lord 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and then we can read from verse 10. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "But God has revealed them unto us by his spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yeah, the deep things of God. For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so, the things of God knows no man, but the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Praise the name of our Lord. When you look at these scriptures, there are three kinds of spirits. There is the human spirit. That's the spirit we are born with. As a human being, you must have a human spirit. So when your human spirit leaves your body, then you are dead. But then there is also the spirit of the world. And the spirit of the world is the spirit of Satan. And all the evil spirit and now spiritually speaking, the spirit of the world and the spirit of the devils. You know, they are the ones that bring darkness. They are the ones that bring things contrary to God because that's the mission of Satan. He will always make you to do things that are contrary to God. Now you may not be doing those things. But yet you may have the passion of those things. You may be thinking about those things. You may be imagining about those things. You may be dreaming about those things. But yet you don't do them. It is darkness. Praise the name of the Lord. Like when you have a despising spirit, that's darkness. When you have a murmuring spirit, that is a darkness. When you have a complaining spirit, murmuring spirit, Now the some of these things you may not see them but in you they are there. You look at somebody you demean them. Nobody knows that you're doing it. Some bondage that you have with you. You look at something which has happened. You complain you mama like now our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us go and pick this up in Luke chapter 7. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 7 and let us pick it up from verse 36. The Bible says, "And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him, and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet. They invited the Lord Jesus Christ and we have prepared the dinner for him and brother Brandham teaches us that God keeps his appointment. God keeps his appointment. God fulfills his word. You take God at his word, he will perform his word. Praise the name of the Lord. Do you believe he can perform his word before you? Praise the name of our Lord. You take him at his word. So this Pharisee desired Jesus and then the Bible says Jesus came and then there was a woman in the city which was a sinner. And when she she knew that Jesus sat at the meet at the Pharisees house, she brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears. and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and he kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. And when the Pharisee which had bidded him saw it, he spoke within himself, &gt;&gt; saying, "This man If he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him for she's a sinner. He didn't speak it, but it was in the heart darkness. And many people get control in this kind of condition. He's here but his heart is not there. He's saying this &gt;&gt; but is meaning something darkness. Actually it is a hypocrisy. So now this man was complaining. Oh this woman cannot do that. How can you allow this man? There's some form of darkness holding such a kind of station just like the same thing. When the Bible says, let us pick that scripture also in Matthew chapter 5 and then we pick it up in verse Matthew chapter 5. Let me get the scripture here. Verse 27. You've heard that it was said by them of old time, thou shalt not commit adultery. Now that was an act physically into it that he said you have heard. So what do you do now? Verse 28. But I say unto you that soever lookth on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. Now you have not gone into the act but just merely looking. He says you have committed the act. So the one who is looking is responsible is having the spirit of a doubt. And then the woman who was dressed in a funny way, you know, tight clothes, you know, the devil, the devil likes promoting what he has. He likes how to bring it on adverts and he brings some kind of fashion &gt;&gt; and then you admire that fashion. and then you put on tight clothes. But it is an evil spirit. It's a spirit of adultery that anoints you for you to put on clothes where men can lust after you darkness. So when you go to buy any clothes, decide yourself when I put on this clothes How will I be before people? Why do I want to expose my body? Why do I want men to last after me? Why do I want people to see my figure how it is built up and things like that? It's darkness. And you know the Bible also tells us when we go to Proverbs chapter 7. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 7 and then let us speak this scripture here. Praise the name of our Lord. Let me get it. Proverbs 7 verse 10. &gt;&gt; And behold, there met him a woman with the utter of a harot and subtile of heart. Now her dresses reflected the evil spirit in her. She had a spirit of adultery. And now that spirit of adultery made her outside to show what is inside of us. darkness, bondage. So even now with all the fashions that the devil is producing where you put on tight clothes, you know where you put on clothes that expose your private parts of the body. It's the spirit of adultery. It's the spirit of how [Music] because they are displaying what they have. They are promoting what they have. It's &gt;&gt; darkness. So now for you to be delivered, you need that power of darkness to completely be uprooted away from you that you can get the spirit of Christ to come and govern your heart. So now when you go to the shop, you'll make the right decision of what to buy. when you are going to dress up, you'll make the right decision of what to put on. Praise the name of our Lord. And that's why we need the new birth, the Holy Spirit to come and take charge of our human spirit, when your human spirit is under Satan to fro and then you'll do whatever the devil desires. But now when your human spirit is under the leadership of the Holy Spirit, you will do what God wants you to do. And it will not be a burden to you. It will not be a law. Praise the name of the Lord. It will be a joy to you for you to do the things of God. Praise the name of the Lord. Why? because your nature has been changed. And so your nature, you desire the things of God. You desire to follow after righteousness. Like when Noah had had birds and animals in the ark, praise the name of our Lord. And now it had stopped raining. And Noah wanted to find out what is on earth. So he sent messengers and he had messengers and he sent them messengers of different nature in Genesis chapter 8. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says in verse seven, "And it came to pass at the end of 40 days that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. [Music] And he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. Now this raven grow vulture didn't meet the fellowship. Didn't miss the fellowship in the ark. But when he went on the waters and got dead bodies on top of the water floating started feasting from this dead body to the other dead body to the other dead body and the Bible says until the earth dried many days [Music] it was feeding on dead body. things. They have been punishing us at home every time. Now I have the opportunity. I'm in university. I'll wear the way I want. I'll sleep where I want to sleep. Who's going to follow me up? Because of the nature, the nature was unconverted. They can be like a married man. They give him a trip to go overseas. Who will be there to see me? Lives a very immoral life up there. Raven, this dirty thing tonight at home. I've been missing this now. God has served me. But that Satan that this year that there was the raven the nature was not converted. Ah this one is a good deal now in the message. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me let me just speak this here in the message questions and answers. Brother Brandham says, "Look in the ark. Noah turned the crow out." &gt;&gt; Now, what was he? He was a crow. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. He sat on the same roost. He sat on the same roost where the dove was. They both sat in the same ro. But when he turned the old crow out because they were all in the ark and in the ark there was nothing rotten. So this scroll here would eat millet The way the dove was eating milk would eat maze the way this one was eating. &gt;&gt; But the dove does not have bile. So it can't digest rotten things. It kills it. But now this Mr. Crow It's dirty things and those which are not dirty. So when he was released out of the ark here there is no church. What an opportunity I can sleep the whole Sunday. That's the nature of a crow. So it went when it was released out of the app. Brother Brandham says, "I imagine all the waters was stinking with millions of people's swelled bodies. And the horses and the animals all dead. The whole world was dead. And there they was this old dead carcasses of floating things on top of the water and things like that. And Noah turned the dove out. He guessed the he saw the sun the sunshine and he wanted to know whether the water had receded or not. When he turned the crow out, the old crow fruit down to an old dead body and then say my just fine that is good nature thisole I can't miss ladies night first lady. &gt;&gt; I can't get the first one. This that thing that so then it was jumping from dead body to dead body. You can imagine how many days until the water came down. This one was eating this dirt that he had already forgotten about. No more mind about the messenger. Those are none of my concern. Cut a thing here. Bondage. And then he says eating dead body. [Music] That was his nature. He was a crow. No matter how much would set with the D, how much would have had Noah preach. how much would have set with the clean B. He was a crow to begin with as soon as he got the opportunity to show his colors. He showed it do everything they want to do. Darkness, it's a bondage. &gt;&gt; But now When he turned the dove out, when she started out, she couldn't stand that. Nowhere she would go. She wouldn't find rest for the souls of her feet. So, she came back to the earth. That's the way it is. Praise the name of our Lord. You know in in Genesis chapter 8 verse 7. He released the raven a man with an old nature and converted Sunday in church Monday. What I missed on Sunday? Let me go and enjoy myself. That's a crow. But now a dove. When the dove leaves Sunday, [Music] he's longing for another Sunday. When will I come back in the presence? In verse eight, and he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abetted from off the face of the ground. But the dove found no rest for the soul of her feet. And she returned unto him into the earth. for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in the ark. Praise the name of Now you see what the what happens with this kind of natures. The dove couldn't find peace because it was not her nature to fly over dirt things. It was not her nature to go and eat dirt things. It was stinking. Praise the name of the Lord. And that's the same thing if you are a true Christian. Your mind is not how much you can live with sin. [Music] If you're a true Christian, your mind will be like this. How long will I endure this? But your mind is like this. Let me get off this sin. You'll not allow something wrong. But you'll see how you avoid it as much as possible. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to First Thessalonians chapter 5. 1 Thessonians chapter 5. &gt;&gt; And then we read verse 22. Abstain from all appearance of evil. 12 5 2022 he saidain in other words see that you don't go where you know that there is sin you know what happens in birth then Where do I go? My friends have called me in the back. &gt;&gt; For them, they will be drinking beer and I'll be taking soda. &gt;&gt; There is somewhere where one company which makes beer was making sodas. But then made sure that whatever they were making was packaged like beers. People could not be fooled. People could not be fooled. until that thing had to close that line wouldn't continue. You know why are you in those places? Why you what pleases you is where dirt things are. Like now if you're looking for a place to rent, you want to rent where lodes are. You want to rent where you know disco are nightclubs neighborhood for you. You're not bothered for me. Just bring the sleeper. You abstain and you pray against those things that happen in your community. You are crying. You are dying against the abomination that are done in the place where you living. Praise the name of our Lord. Like now you see the madness which has been happening in schools. Proh dresses funny, a boy dresses funny or senior six and then they start pairing themselves and you say comes also. Thank God the government has banned those things. very funny things. This boy comes, you know, they they act like they are couples, very funny things. And I pray God gives us grace, even the funny spirits on introduction, you know, when they see women come And then now they send boys or men. [Music] When they see men come, they give women belts. Funny things which happen and then we rejoice. Evil spirits, darkness, that's not culture. It's not culture, it's similarity, &gt;&gt; but that's the thing which people get excited. And then you see young men when they come, it's as if they are coming to grab whatever they coming to grab. And then they embarrass the women. Some are not interested in that thing. Of course, they are those who feed on those things, &gt;&gt; but others are not interested in. And then they just embarrass very funny things and then maybe if it is a married man or married woman, he has never dancing with a stranger. very funny way. You know these are wicked spirit that come. But of course there are those crows who like that now you get yourself in that case in that prison if you are going it why do you go and participate and participate in that somebody to just kind of you dance with you, hug you, do whatever they want to do. Funny things. And then they want to maybe put a belt around or put the shoes on. It's bad. But these are the things we have in our communities. But it is vultures which like those things. Praise the name of our Lord. And what makes strange you get homes of believers. It's the believer who is coming to be introduced and it's the believer who is going to introduce. The parents are believers. And then there is secular music there. funny things about life. So the Bible says abstain from all appearance of evil. Praise the name of the Lord because all these are avenues. Satan take a hold of you. You know Satan is so sabotaged. He uses every opportunity there to take a hold of a person. He uses many opportunities. &gt;&gt; One, you know, it may be something you because Satan is a spirit. So you can use any point of contact. Maybe what you watch on your phone and it becomes a bondage, maybe what you hear on the radio, it becomes a bondage or what you saw on television, it becomes a bondage. Or even what you read in your spirit, it becomes a bondage. Or maybe in your community some funny spirits which are there, some funny things which are done there. Then you get taken a hold because you have a human spirit. And this human spirit can be influenced by any spirit because from childhood your human spirit has always been under influence. Your parents first influenced you and now to make it worse. When the parents don't raise you, you are raised by mates. Then you see this m comes with this evil spirit. The other one comes with another evil spirit. The other one comes complaining the child. If the other one comes knows how to abuse, the child will start abusing. You start wondering but you know she has got a door from different mates. This one comes with this father spirit. This one. So the child just knows all those things. wondering where is this thing coming from? Influence because they have a spirit and so they always look to the person they spend most of the time with like maybe in the community your children are all the time in the neighborhood playing don't have control over them there. picking this funny spirit, picking this funny spirit, learning how to steal, learning how to do this, influence. So then we need to see that we are born again and if you have children, see how you influence them in the way of the Lord. Find out, take interest in your children. You know Satan has has all schemes. You are looking for the money and surely you need it but your family is being destroyed. I have to make money. When you come home no time of fellowship with the children. You are tired in the morning I have to go. Somebody else is raising your child. But what kind of spirits? Maybe it's the reven raising your child and then you'll have another revenue in your home. You know, because we have to be careful. These are spirits. Now in 2 Corinthians chapter 10, praise the name of our Lord. 2 Corinthians chapter 10. And then we read from verse three. The Bible says, "For though we walk in the flesh, we don't walk after the flesh." That's what the Bible is telling us. We walk in this flesh, &gt;&gt; but our battles and not in this flesh. Where are the battles? For the weapons of our warfare are not cannon, but mighty through God, pulling down the stronghold, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts against the knowledge of God. and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled. Praise the name of our Lord. He says we don't wrestle with flesh and blood. And so the devil is so smart that he get things that can easily influence any person. Like I was reading about those billionaires who make these programs that operate phones and computers. I was reading about them and then these people they have strict regulations to their children not spend a lot of time on this thing. They control their children like nothing until they are children not all the time on these things. Then for us who receive them You know the child will you leave now? What is in this tool? Then the child is grown up on an iPad until you can't take them away from me. bound. Until these kids not to go to places you have never gone to, spirits and then the child can become rough when you remove the phone or he can throw it down or fight you back. pulling it from you. How are we bringing our children up? &gt;&gt; You know, you need to handle the child very well. &gt;&gt; Were you raised with a phone? Praise the name of But that's how the generation is. Is the devil has perverted us. until we have left the first principles of raising children. All the time on phone, all the time on phone until they get into dirty things. And by the time you discover they are fully destroyed, but they are your children. And then you find is hard to live with your children. Who do you want to raise them when you have already spoiled them? But we have a responsibility. You know, Satan is so tricky, you see that even you at your age, you must have selfont control. Self control. How about this small child who doesn't know things goes on a channel like now some of these channels you go to Tik Tok the only thing to go to the next you just and another comes in again another and the systems know how to pile them together artificial intelligence Because these people are smart. [Music] They can they can use they can do research and they know that this contact here. He wants people who are naked. &gt;&gt; So the advers just come in that line. this one. So they just come in that line. Then once in a while others pop up. The seekers say, "Hey, why is this?" Now when you open there, it takes you to most sides of that. You must exercise self control and this thing I'm not going there. How about the small child and they know that the data is over there is no data or if they get some small money buy for me data feeding on that things. Satan is doing a lot of destruction. So then we need to be careful you know darkness just keeps on creeping. So you find somebody is bound by evil spirit. This one is also bound by evil spirit until darkness just takes over. No time to read the word of God. No time to pray. No time to testify. no time to think about the things of God. And so you find that when they get the phone, they may even spend a whole night on the phone. But when it comes to reading the word, you start and then you start dozing. You put your head in the book. But we have a lot of books with us. That is darkness. There is a bondage that Satan has taken a hold until you even don't know the things of God. Like the way Balam, the way he led the children of Israel into the feast of Balpio, the glor of God came down and then there was judgment in the camp. But then there was a person. Let us go to the book of Numbers. Numbers &gt;&gt; chapter 20. Let us go to the book of numbers. Just I beg your pardon. Let me just 23. &gt;&gt; Abinat, okay, sorry. 25 and then the Bible says in verse one, &gt;&gt; and Israel abim and the people began to commit war with the daughters of Moab. Now the Jews they had a particular dressing of selfrespect. They had a particular when they worshiped and now here Balam taught Balac how to cause a stumbling block to the children of Israel. telling them we are all one let us socialize and then now these people get there because Israel was passing in the land of Balam and so now when Israel was passing through Moab then these people decided what we do Now let us do everything we can to have these people with us. Like's wife, Joseph had selfrespect. But now Pifer's wife comes and dressed before Joseph. We alone here. Joseph had just run away. Now here the children of Israel said, "Ah, what dancing stroke is this one?" And then they got themselves into that wickedness, eating fruits of idols, swinging around, everybody picking whoever they wanted, going down to idols. committing a doubt of and then the Bible says Israel began to commit wardom with the daughters of Moab. But how did it reach there? They got into an atmosphere where it was darkness and they lasted after that. They desire to do the same thing. You know, it's just like people who are married. Why do people who have failed in their marriages be your friends? Those are your friends who have failed in marriage. that when he says anything I will not care or get Nigerian things which can teach you how to coach something why would you go to dirty places to learn how to behave right? Why? You know, and then you know, you find that now to you that's now the way to go. &gt;&gt; Why like now if you you really want to see that you get into a certain place further, somebody who has done it better than you, not somebody who is discouraging you. If you're a student and you want to continue your study, why do you get people don't go to school? This one is studying, just wasting time. They pulling you back. Some of your friends don't want to work. You also get the same spirit. You know, you are just associating yourself with something wrong. So the Bible says And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods. And the people did eat and bow down to their gods. And Israel joined himself at Balpio. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel. [Music] And so then the Lord said unto Moses, "Take all the heads of the people and hung them up before the Lord against the sun, that the fierce of the Lord may be turned away from Israel. And behold, one of the children of Israel, came and brought unto his brethren a Midionite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. Now you see these people are already weeping but the other one is bound by darkness is bound by that kind of spirit has no sense at all. He's going where there is rust doing something which is wrongful. And that's how the devil does. You know, somebody can be living in sin and used to doing it and doesn't care when they continue, you know, just continuously a real bondage. But we need to come out of all this darkness. Whatever bondage that is in our lives, we need to overcome it today. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to overcome it today. Whatever your situation you are going through, it may be that you don't show it, but it's a spiritual condition. There are evil spirits that have bound you like those seven demons that were in Mary Magdalene, you know, you know, proud, you know, some of those spirits like the Bible says in Ephesians chapter 4, let us go and pick that scripture. Ephesians chapter 4 and then verse 30 says, "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption, let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice. He says, "Put away bitterness, &gt;&gt; wrath, anger, clamor, evil speaking, malice. Put them away." Praise the name of our Lord. Put them away. There's darkness. Praise the name of our Lord. So then you must be willing to be delivered out of that condition. Praise the name of the Lord. Now in the in the scriptures here, let us go to Matthew, Matthew chapter 4 and then verse 16. The Bible says &gt;&gt; the people which sat in darkness saw great light. You may also be sitting in darkness. You are bound in one way or another. The Bible says the people which sat in darkness, they saw the great light. Praise the name of Lord. And we have the great light coming to us. That we can leave our darkness. We can leave our evil thoughts. We can leave all our bondages. We can leave everything that has held us back and run into the light. Praise the name of God. And then the Bible says, "And to them which sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up. [Music] From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The first step of living darkness, repent. Praise the name of God. Repent and be willing. Lord have mercy upon me. Lord, deliver me in this kind of condition. Now in the message the secret seal, brother Brandham says, "And so God, if we will be willing to confess our sins, and do that which is right, and ask for mercy, call upon him. God is willing and waiting to grant it to us out of darkness. Praise the name of our Lord. You know the amount of darkness that's binding you this morning. God is willing. God is waiting. Confess it before the Lord. Lord, I'm bound by Lord. I'm bound by this wickedness. Lord, I'm bound by confess it before the Lord and show him you don't like it. Praise the name of the Lord. Show him I don't like this. When I dress, I dress things that are tight. They make me happy. You repent about that. And then you have that spirit leave you. Praise the name of Lord in my life. I like hanging around these kind of people. They are wrong people. But yet you feel happy. You want to move with him. You confess it. The Lord deliver me from this like the prodigal son. He knew where he came from. Praise the name of God. He was in light with his father. And then the group influences you know they say you are old style you are smart why don't you come and do this and he left light and went into darkness and when he was in darkness it really worked And then he came to his senses. He decided, &gt;&gt; I will arise and go back to my father. You also need to make that decision. Whatever darkness that is holding, you need to make a decision. Lord, deliver me out of this. Lord, set me out of this situation. I'm not pleasant with the way I hear. I'm not pleasant with the things I read. I'm not pleasant with the things I see. I'm not pleasant with the things I hear. Whenever I get my phone, all my data goes to funny things. Confess it, repent about it, and turn around from it. Praise the name of you. believe those wicked things. If your time you are hanging out around bars, if the time you are hanging out around sports betting places or you hang out around or where politicians sit these days they make shrines for them. You get those shrines on the road and then you also want to hang there. You confess, Lord, I don't want this kind of. And then you leave it. It's darkness. You turn from those evil things. And then that's how the Lord can deliver you. If you are willing, confess it. Lord, I don't want this kind of praise the name of now in the message. How can I overcome? He says overcome means to stand the test. That is right. Like all the old saints did. Jesus did. Amidst all of his enemies, he stood the test. Everything was tested against he stood. In the very face of sickness and him being Messiah, he healed them. In the face of death, he brought it back to life. In the face of Calvary, his own death, he defeated it by surrendering himself. Why? By the word of God said, he destroyed this temple. and I'll raise it up in three days. The word said so. And in the presence of death, &gt;&gt; he defeated it. &gt;&gt; He overcame death. In the presence of hell, he defeated hell. And overcame hell. Yes. In the presence of the grave, he overcame the grave. Why? All by the word and humility. There is the real man. There is the one to make your example. He defeated everything. Overcame temptations was for him. You know what? That the Bible say he was tempted in all points like we are yet without sin. He was tempted by drinking. He was tempted by women. He was tempted by everything to be tempted by. He was tempted by everything that we are. He was a man. And yet you could not put a mark on him. Overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks. Praise the name of you just know this one is coming like this. Let me avoid it. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of you overcome. When when Joseph saw wife said let me take off. And then there are some bold women. Why are you running women? Joseph had to run away. There are those who are bold that they can force you. Run away. [Laughter] You know you take off. You don't just no scream. Joseph had to do that. You know the devil is so tricky. Then he said lot of people say there is no devil. &gt;&gt; It is just a thought. Don't you believe that there is a real devil? And he's just as real as you are. Anybody, a real devil. And you must recognize him real. You must know he's a devil. At the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he is against you. Satan is not your friend and don't befriend his schemes. It's not for friendship. The Bible say the thief comes to steal. That's the devil. &gt;&gt; When he comes, he either has coming to steal something from you to kill or to destroy. That's what the devil does. Whenever he comes, there's something he has come to do. If he can't kill you, if he can't destroy you, he will he will steal the joy of your salvation. until you get discouraged about being a Christian. It's the devil working something he has stolen from you. So, and yet the joy of the Lord is our strength. So, what does he do? He makes you lose desire of fellowship. You don't care whether you come to church or not. He has stolen something from you. No more joy. So you are bound. You are held captive. Bound. There's something he has stolen from you. And if he knows he can do this, he goes further. He keeps on coming. If he knows he has stolen, he wants to steal more. or he wants to make sure that everything is not there. That's what the devil does. So you don't give him room anywhere. Don't give an room for Satan to open up anywhere that he may come and maybe sit in your he sits in your heart. You know, you entertain him, then you start feeding him. Don't do that. Praise the name of our Lord. See that you don't give him room. Don't give entertain him. He cannot be part of your career. Praise the name of you know bicles have careers and it's your energy to move that what you holding. Why do you load yourself with Satan? You know you are carrying a lot like those idol worshippers. They would carry their gods on their back when he reaches in this place to rest. He puts there and then starts if it can't move itself. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know like somebody &gt;&gt; when he's going for a safari &gt;&gt; you carry short dresses you know there we are going to you know then you go there and then you change you're woring you you're the same carrying idols. How we did to J? &gt;&gt; You know we go there. &gt;&gt; We going swimming. &gt;&gt; But how are you going to dress? &gt;&gt; How are you going to dress? &gt;&gt; You know these are for swimming. I'm going to be in the water. You're carrying your your idols here. Oh, some funny things. Some secret life. secret. [Music] You know, it's a bondage. So, you need to see that you reject it. You denounce it. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he says, "The same time that you recognize him and know that is a devil that is against you, then to overcome, you must recognize that God in you is greater might than he. The one that's in you has already overcome. And by his grace, you are more than a match for him. That's real overcoming. You recognize, praise the name of God. So whatever darkness that is holding us, let us reject it. Whatever the devil is trying to hold us, denounce it. Put it aside. Praise the name of put away. Put off. Praise the name of God. I just come in the presence of God. I say, "Lord, I need your praise the name of our Lord. I need your victory. Praise the name of our Lord." Now, in the message, questions and answers. Brother Brham says, He says here in this message &gt;&gt; paragraph 214. You are saved. I'm so glad to know that Christ saves us. But we may backslide. We may do wrong. We all have to go our ups and downs. But in your soul, as soon as you do anything, well, there is something goes wrong in you. You know it is now right in the now. Right there is the time to jump. That's the time to get get away from it. Now you say you got out here today and somebody comes to you and say, "Hey, they tell me you are one of them holy rollers right quick." Satan says, "Snap him down. I don't know about being a I am a Christian and always with and always with evil meet with good and remember now just take this remember remember this When you meet evil with good, evil cannot stand the presence of God. You cannot do it. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, somebody is abusing you. You don't abuse back. Somebody is fighting you. You don't fight back. But then the nature of Christ will come out is bringing bitterness. You bring sweetness. He's abusing you. You forgive them. Not abuse again. So you have to see that you overcome all forms of darkness in whatever when the devil comes to attack you. Praise the name of God. And then he says, &gt;&gt; listen, I don't care how dark the night is. It may be so dark till you could feel it you could put your hands up like this and you couldn't see no shadow of no time. That may be the condition you are in. So dark, so in bondage. But then he says the least little bit of light will expose that darkness. Certainly that's the way life is in the presence of death. That's the way right does in the presence of wrong. That's the way faith does in the presence of doubt. it is scatters all away. So then in that kind of condition, praise the name of the Bible says in Psalms 112. Let us speak that scripture. Psalms 112 and then verse four. And to the upright There arises light in the darkness. So when you are in darkness, light arises and that light comes for your deliverance for your victory that you can come out of whatever condition you are in and be made free. like the prodical son. He was living in darkness. But then light arose and he remembered his father and said, "My father has enough food." And then he resolved, "Let me go back to my father." That's the same thing we need to do. Let me reconcile with God. Whatever wrong I have done, Lord, I want to make it right. Be willing to reconcile. Be willing. Praise the name of our Lord. And don't allow darkness to keep you away. Don't allow your condition to hold you in bondage. Whatever situation you have which is not pleasing, it is darkness. And there is light here. Praise the name of our Lord. There is a man here who can turn on the light. Praise the name of our Lord. He can come down in your confession. He can come down in your stress. It doesn't matter how long you've been bound. Praise the name of our Lord. It doesn't matter the chains that have bound. There is a man who can turn on the light. Praise the name of our Lord. like the the the man who was running away from Jerusalem. Jerusalem a holy city and then he was going down to Jericho a cast city hell running from heaven going to hell and many people's lives get into that kind of condition they leave the heavenly influence and then they go down to hell influence It may be at your place of work. It may be at your home. It may be where you live. A hell conditioner. But then when this man was beaten on the road, the Bible says he was left for dead. And then the Samaritan came and had compassion. And the Lord Jesus Christ is that good Samaritan who has compassion upon you in your condition. Praise the name of Lord. He has come to deliver you in whatever condition you are in. Praise the name of our Lord. So what did the Samaritan do? He got this man. He put him on his bed and then he took him to the in. Praise the name of brother Brandham say the in is the church. We are now all of us in the in praise the name of we are in the in the good Samaritan is here and he has the inkeeper and the inkeeper is the minister. Praise the name of. And then brother Brandham says he gave the inkeeper two pens. One was the word, the other was the spirit. And then he said, "If it is not enough, I will come and bring more." Praise the name of our Lord. So we are in the inn. Praise the name of our Lord. We are in a in a hospital where we can be treated and be made whole of whatever condition we have. Praise the name of. You must believe it that this medicine will work for me. Praise the name of you. You must believe it. This doctor will treat me well. You must have faith. But if you don't have faith, however good the medicine is, however good the doctor is, it will do you no good. Praise the name of our Lord. So we are in the in let us receive the treatment and where you need Lord I ask for more. Praise the name of our Lord. I need more of your strength. I need more of your word. I need more of your deliverance. Praise the name of the Lord. So you don't allow yourself to be held in captive to be in darkness forever. Praise the name of our Lord. When there's a man who can turn on the light, praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message, let me try so we can finish. Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever. He says now the only thing I can do is to cast away that doubt from your heart [Music] will come out of this thing. That's doubt and that's darkness. So the thing is to get away that darkness. But what will it help you to continue doubting? Be like those lepers. There was famine in the land and they knew there was food in the Syrian. He said if we stay here, we are going to die, if we go there, they may kill us. But it's the same thing. But we go there, get what to eat and be alive. So they decided to reject their condition of famine and go where the food is. That's the same thing with us. I make a decision to reject my bondage and say, Lord, praise the name of you. Cry out, Lord, it is me. Lord, I need help. Those lepers unclean, unclean. Praise the name of Jesus. So then here he says and the doubt leaves you and you feel that there is something near you. The angels of God are in this building. You say, "Is that so, preacher?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The Bible said they are the angels of God encamped about those who fear. But there is a dark shadow between you and the angel that wants to help you. There's a there's a dark shadow between you and that angel that wants to help you bringing the message of Christ. That's unbelief. If you can get that unbelief, that dark shadow, then you'll see plainly. Then you rise. and rejoice and go home shouting, praising God. Get well, &gt;&gt; don't let that shadow stand between you. Praise the name of our Lord. Our Lord Jesus Christ said, "Where two or three are gathered in I'll be there in their meeting." He's right here. But it is the shadow of doubt. Shadow of unbelief that makes you feel situation. No one can help me. &gt;&gt; Just cast away that doubt and believe Lord you are here to deliver. It says the angel has the message of Christ and the angels messengers. They are sent with sweet messages. Message of deliverance like the angel who came to the prison where Peter was bound to the chains were broken. Even now whatever chain you are in can be broken in the name of the Lord. You just believe it. This habit has bound me for so long. I've been in this for so long. I want to be released. Praise the name of God. I want to be delivered this morning. Praise the name of Lord. You just believe. Lord, I need your deliverance. Praise the name of our Lord. In whatever condition, the Lord is here to deliver. Praise the name of our Lord. May God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us sing that song. Pass me not oriental savior. Let us stand up. Let the song leader come. Just believe it. Take time and talk to the Lord. Lord, don't pass me like Zakayas bound in all kind of evil. The Lord went his way. The woman at the well, the prostitute, Jesus passed by her. The same thing now. Jesus is passing your way. He want to set you free. Just believe it with all your heart. Lord, deliver me out of this darkness. Lord, deliver me out of this bondage. Praise the name of &gt;&gt; Pass me not hear my humble cry. [Music] Oh why not thou art go my savior do not pass me by call the savior savior oh savior I have cry. Why are thou art?

[Music] Just open up your heart like that prodigal son. Every one of us knows where you have fallen. Speak to the master. Say, "Lord, I'm bringing myself, Lord, my body, my soul." You said in your word that we present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable before thee. Like David, we are born and shaped in iniquity. Like Paul says, the things we desire to do, we do not. And the things we don't want to do are the things we do because you have mercy and compassion. Oh Lord, your light is shining. Oh heavenly father in our areas of darkness. Oh king of glory. Won't you be gracious oh heavenly father to forgive. Oh Lord. Father we are bound by different chains. Oh Lord. We are bound by different circumstances Lord. Some might be battling drugs. Some might be battling adultery, Lord. Some might be battling pornography. Some might be battling every different kind of spirit, Lord. But we are so thankful, oh heavenly father, because when we desire deep down in our hearts, Lord, when we confess our faults, oh Lord, you said, "If my people who are called by name shall humble themselves shall seek my face and turn away from their wicked ways." Father this afternoon we are turning away Lord from all wickedness. Lord we are saying heavenly father like the prodigy son we have wandered far from the fold. Lord you have mercy upon us. Like blinders Lord we are crying. Oh son of David have mercy upon. Father I do not desire to live this way. I do not desire to walk in a life of sin. But like Paul says, the sin that easily beset sacked, Father, holding on to us, we pray by the grace of God, Father, that you may deliver your children. Like that quoting out, Brother Borders, you God is setting his children free. God is breaking every chain. Father, as we cry out this afternoon, oh Lord, may you break the chains, oh heavenly father, that the enemy, oh Lord, has tied your children long upon, oh father, have mercy and compassion upon them. Lord, we are crying out, oh heavenly father, this afternoon. Oh Lord, as you're setting free, oh Lord, you are crying out, brother Borders, cry out to the master. He's here to set you free. Oh father, will you be gracious Lord? Every chain of circumstance Lord. Some are genetical spirits. Oh Lord, some are cultural spirits. Oh heavenly father, we do not desire to walk in them. Oh Lord, will your mercies be shed upon us, oh father, and give us the light, oh Lord, the light of your word, oh king of glory, to help us, oh heavenly father, overcome, Lord, every power of darkness, oh Lord, because you said in your word that whoever is in Christ overcomes the world. Father, would you help us, Lord, that that overcoming power, oh God, may live in our lives, Lord, overcoming in our homes, oh Lord, overcoming in our neighborhoods, oh Father, overcoming at our places of work, oh Lord, we desire that overcoming power, oh Lord, how we love you, oh Lord, we [Music] just continue to speak to him in your own way.
