[27:37] enjoy amen our day of worship and
[27:42] praise amen so many of these songs that
[27:46] have been
[27:48] written and brother
[27:50] jrey amen he was just singing about his
[27:54] calling
[27:58] WR very wonderful
[28:01] music amen let's just to the Book of
[28:05] [Music]
[28:08] Psalms
[28:13] 100se before we read the
[28:16] scripture let us B heads in a word of
[28:19] prayer father in the name of
[28:22] Jesus we come before your
[28:25] presence fully consec created
[28:29] Lord for the purpose that you may speak
[28:32] to
[28:34] us we pray that you may come
[28:37] down that you may use this verse of
[28:41] clay to speak to
[28:44] souls that you love so
[28:46] much that you bought them with your own
[28:51] life us father speaking such a way
[28:56] Lord that your word may go the right
[28:58] spots of our
[29:01] heart that you may hide them
[29:04] there father that you may anoint them
[29:06] with the holy
[29:08] spirit that as we keep walking along
[29:11] this PM
[29:13] Journey we keep picking out the
[29:17] Fulfillment saying that this Day
[29:21] scripture has been
[29:22] fulfill me the needs of your people
[29:26] father we commit the
[29:30] in Jesus name amen so Psalms
[29:37] verse4 I'm speaking to you for about an
[29:42] hour amen and verse
[29:46] four he says enter into his gates with
[29:51] Thanksgiving and it SC with praise
[30:01] may the Lord blessing the reading of his
[30:05] word you may be
[30:08] seated so
[30:10] today I've got a thought that I want to
[30:14] speak
[30:16] on I want to title
[30:20] it the mind of the
[30:23] word on worship and music
[30:28] the mind of the
[30:30] word in other words what the word
[30:34] says about worship and
[30:37] music now holy ghost
[30:41] music is to
[30:43] God and God Alone is the one that is
[30:47] worshiped in our
[30:50] SS and if one performs the
[30:53] song it will certainly open flood gates
[30:57] of Jo
[31:00] to the singer
[31:03] heart you feel so good you just enter
[31:07] into the
[31:09] gates but at the end of
[31:11] it we must be humble
[31:15] enough not share in the glory it
[31:20] brings because the glory should be going
[31:22] to God and
[31:25] God so one thing to note
[31:29] is that music is a
[31:32] gift and therefore every
[31:35] musician is a
[31:38] steward because the the the the the the
[31:41] the music in itself is a
[31:46] gift and every man who holds the gift of
[31:51] God is a
[31:53] steward we shall take a little visit to
[31:56] the book of ezek
[32:00] and you wonder why I would pick eel
[32:05] now but let's go to Ezekiel
[32:09] 28 the king of
[32:12] Tyrus was an embodiment of
[32:16] Lucifer you know just like the
[32:19] Antichrist in the Book of
[32:22] Revelation so God in eel 28
[32:27] addresses the king of
[32:30] Tyrus like he was addressing the Devil
[32:35] Himself you see if God ever had to speak
[32:38] to
[32:39] me I would rather he speaks to me like
[32:42] he's speaking to his own
[32:45] son amen if he chooses to correct me
[32:49] I'll say thank you
[32:52] Lord if he chooses to rebuke me I say
[32:55] Lord have mercy upon me
[32:59] I wouldn't want God to speak to
[33:03] me like he was speaking to the Devil
[33:07] Himself he was speaking to a man whose
[33:10] heart was lifted
[33:13] up the heart was full of
[33:16] Pride he claimed to be equal to
[33:21] God you know a man who had inflated
[33:25] himself
[33:28] by a
[33:29] gift which God had given to him so he
[33:33] was not a good
[33:35] sewer he had a gift the gift was to give
[33:38] praise to
[33:40] God but he wanted to turn that
[33:44] gift that the rest of the
[33:46] Angels would also use it to praise
[33:50] him we must be
[33:52] careful always to keep the boundaries
[33:55] when God gives us the gifts
[34:00] so eel
[34:01] 2 and verse 12 he a son of man take up a
[34:07] lamentation upon the king of
[34:11] Tyrus and say unto him th says the Lord
[34:16] thou seest up the
[34:20] s full of
[34:23] wisdom and perfect in Beauty when it
[34:26] comes to Beauty and
[34:30] wisdom he seals up the you know he seals
[34:34] up the
[34:36] P there could not be any better
[34:41] creation than Lucifer
[34:43] words he was endowed with rare
[34:48] Beauty and he was endowed with
[34:52] wisdom until God
[34:55] himself say he seals up the
[34:59] beauty seals up
[35:03] the amen th been in
[35:09] the now I want you to see how is
[35:12] addressing this King
[35:15] here amen he speaking to
[35:19] him like he is addressing the
[35:23] devil meaning that if one is not careful
[35:29] he can be an embodiment of
[35:34] evil amen but by the grace of God we are
[35:39] the embodiment of the Holy
[35:42] Ghost amen he tells the king of
[35:46] tyus thou Hast been in
[35:50] Eden which was not literally right
[35:58] but he was addressing the
[36:01] spirit that embodied in this
[36:04] man th been ined the garden of
[36:09] God every precious
[36:12] stone was th
[36:15] C the S the to he counts them
[36:20] all amen and he says at the end of the I
[36:25] mean of the verse
[36:27] and thy pipes was prepared in thee in
[36:31] the day thou was
[36:42] created Garden Of
[36:44] God using the
[36:47] serpent but now you are using the
[36:51] embodiment of the king of
[36:53] tus so you know he was describing
[36:59] and it was only a stone or two a stone
[37:02] of beauty away from the entire glory of
[37:10] God so the workmanship of your
[37:14] Tabet and of your
[37:17] pipes was prepared in
[37:20] you the day you were
[37:23] created so he was created to see
[37:28] gifts and
[37:29] callings gifts and
[37:32] callings are without
[37:35] repentance God gives them to
[37:38] you even before you were born or formed
[37:41] in your
[37:44] mother's but when the gifts begins to
[37:48] operate we must be
[37:51] careful that we become faithful stewards
[37:54] to this gift
[37:59] to know why the gift is
[38:01] given the gift is not given to praise
[38:08] yourself no the gift was given to
[38:11] minister to
[38:14] God so every gift that we shall ever
[38:19] get getting from
[38:21] God is for the purpose that it ministers
[38:24] to the body of Christ
[38:29] amen so it's not me that Praises
[38:34] myself Amen in verse
[38:37] 14 Thou Art the anointed
[38:41] cherub that
[38:43] cover and I have set thee
[38:47] Soul thou upon the holy mountain of
[38:53] God I don't want it to be said I was on
[38:56] the mountain of
[38:58] the Holy Mountain of
[39:01] God I want it to be said that I am in
[39:04] the Holy Mountain
[39:06] of I don't want to become an history in
[39:10] any service that I do to
[39:14] God Amen that you have walked up and
[39:18] down in the midst of the storms of
[39:21] fire I don't want it to be said like it
[39:24] is said in verse 15
[39:29] thou was perfect in thy
[39:32] ways I pray that God may give me
[39:36] Grace that he should always be
[39:39] Sav that I am perfect in my
[39:43] way and if I find
[39:47] anything that subtracts my
[39:51] perfection let me realize that God left
[39:55] the blood behind
[39:59] let us make use of the Fountain of
[40:03] blood when you see any kind of
[40:06] St go down and submerge under the
[40:10] fountain amen was perfect in thy
[40:15] ways from the day thou was
[40:20] created
[40:21] till iniquity was found in
[40:25] there amen
[40:28] iniquity was found in
[40:32] the now
[40:34] iniquity is fully knowing what you
[40:37] should
[40:38] do but for your own
[40:42] desire you bypass what you know should
[40:45] be
[40:47] done and do what you think will please
[40:50] you
[40:52] better amen God's word is perfect
[40:57] God's word is
[41:00] absolute God's word is
[41:02] final and that word comes our
[41:06] away we should always say
[41:09] amen amen Lucifer was
[41:12] anointed and
[41:14] perfect and the power of his
[41:18] gift was built in him on the day of
[41:23] creation but what lifted up his heart
[41:27] verse
[41:28] 17 tells us that the
[41:32] gift lifted up his
[41:36] heart every gift God gives
[41:40] us must be used in
[41:45] humility that's what God
[41:47] wants but verse 17
[41:50] here he says th heart was lifted up
[41:57] because of th
[41:59] Beauty who gave him the
[42:01] beauty God gave him the
[42:04] beauty thou has corrupted thy
[42:07] wisdom by reason of thy
[42:10] brightness who gave him that
[42:13] brightness God gave him that bright so
[42:16] the things God ended him
[42:20] with caused him a proud
[42:23] heart Sons and Daughters of God
[42:28] very
[42:29] important that when God gives you a good
[42:32] car God gives you a good
[42:35] house God gives you a good
[42:38] education God gives you a good Ministry
[42:43] gift we should know that that's a
[42:48] responsibility that makes us more
[42:53] submissive Rising above our brothers
[42:59] are you together with me so we need to
[43:01] be good
[43:03] stewards whatever gift we have should
[43:07] declare the goodness of
[43:10] God and also use it in
[43:13] humility never use your
[43:16] gift to hold the church
[43:23] at you say if I don't sing who else will
[43:26] sing
[43:28] and then you let me also step
[43:31] back that they may see how important I
[43:35] am that's a very big
[43:37] mistake never hold the church at
[43:41] R because of the gift God has
[43:44] given that's what Lucifer tried to
[43:48] do he tried to take Heaven
[43:52] at amen we must Minister under the
[43:56] guidance of of the Holy
[43:59] Spirit and also under the guidance of
[44:02] the
[44:04] ministry amen the pastor that God has
[44:07] given the local
[44:09] church the gift should never Minister
[44:13] self
[44:16] glory and especially the music
[44:19] gift there is something strange that the
[44:22] music gift does
[44:27] you know you sing is very nice to sing I
[44:31] think I should take quite a number of
[44:34] services on music
[44:41] and if you
[44:43] sing and it doesn't bring joy On th
[44:47] side there is a
[44:50] problem singing
[44:53] itself opens up a well of joy
[44:59] and then you really feel like you
[45:02] entering into some unit some
[45:05] point but if you
[45:08] sing about the joy and you are miserable
[45:12] there is a
[45:17] problem
[45:19] music has something it
[45:22] does that it excites the people
[45:27] amen so the gifts like the gift of
[45:31] music you know it causes a
[45:36] pool of the
[45:39] people when you're
[45:41] singing you can sing the people
[45:47] healed you know it is such a powerful
[45:53] music brother Bram
[45:57] calling of
[45:58] Abraham he said I'm just the channel
[46:03] he's talking about
[46:05] gifts he says I'm just the
[46:09] channel and in the Good Shepherd of the
[46:13] sheep he says God gave
[46:17] me as a gift to the
[46:21] public I belong to the
[46:25] public when God gives you a
[46:29] gift it's your
[46:32] body that God has
[46:35] chosen to use as a channel to bless the
[46:40] people when he places a gift into your
[46:43] life then you become a gift to the
[46:48] public you belong to the
[46:50] public you don't cannot you cannot pull
[46:55] back it's the people
[46:57] people that use that
[47:00] gift amen so remember now after the
[47:06] fall the gift of
[47:09] music was brought down into a form of
[47:16] entertainment Amen in the cities that
[47:19] K's lines
[47:24] built are you together with me you see
[47:28] it LS the purpose of
[47:31] worship that's why all the
[47:35] music that we
[47:38] compose should not be about
[47:41] us the music we
[47:44] compos must be about
[47:48] Christ it must be to worship
[47:55] andr should be a testament of his
[48:00] goodness amen but when the form came
[48:04] among
[48:05] people it's exactly what Lucifer
[48:10] desired he said I'll go to the sides of
[48:13] the
[48:14] nose and I also be like a
[48:18] god amen he wanted
[48:22] worshipers and he got the
[48:25] worshipers the children of men who had
[48:29] fallen are you together with me and the
[48:32] music they
[48:34] s certainly
[48:37] worship what do they sing about they
[48:41] sing about women they sing about money
[48:45] they sing about fights they sing about
[48:48] all those
[48:49] things don't bring
[48:52] joy take away Joy
[48:57] are you together with me yeah we need
[49:01] music which is written by the young
[49:06] people the music that will bring
[49:10] joy to the hearts of The
[49:14] Listener that will begin a
[49:17] Revival to the hearts that
[49:20] hear are you together with me yes sir in
[49:25] Genesis 4
[49:27] we are now looking at the
[49:29] fall amen we see that in chapter
[49:34] 3 you know there was a
[49:37] fall but the fall became I mean produced
[49:41] some
[49:42] products you see whenever man
[49:45] falls there are certain things that come
[49:48] in
[49:49] life so that you can see that in the
[49:51] man's life there is a
[49:54] fall amen when now mean when Adam
[50:01] fell you know he hid away from
[50:04] God and any man who does not have time
[50:07] for
[50:09] fellow it doesn't matter how much
[50:11] explanation you
[50:13] give that man has fallen in the
[50:17] heart he can explain as much as he
[50:21] wants but you look at the T
[50:29] out of the
[50:30] situations the fall of Adam Adam
[50:37] hides
[50:39] amen now we see also
[50:43] K kills his brother and Kan walks
[50:48] away and he went away from
[50:54] fellow
[50:55] listen Genesis
[50:59] 4:16 and Cain went from the presence of
[51:02] the
[51:04] Lord and dwelt in the land
[51:07] of on the east of
[51:10] Ed and knew his
[51:12] wife and she conceived and be
[51:16] en and bu a city and called the name of
[51:21] the
[51:22] city after the name of his son Enoch
[51:27] but this Enoch is not the Enoch that was
[51:33] translated that Eno that was not
[51:37] translated is the son of
[51:39] Cain he
[51:54] begot then l
[51:58] in
[51:59] [Music]
[52:04] ciam amen and one of his
[52:12] wives was the
[52:14] father of all such as hand
[52:21] [Music]
[52:27] notice that he was not a
[52:32] worshiper he was doing all those
[52:36] trumpets and all those
[52:39] orans not
[52:41] toship but to sing the people
[52:48] happy when we write our
[52:51] music we are not trying to sing the
[52:54] people happy
[52:57] we are worshiping
[52:58] God we are bringing them into an
[53:03] atmosphere amen praise God so that God
[53:08] may move their
[53:10] hearts so music for
[53:14] entertainment began in the Fallen cities
[53:18] of that had the depression of the sinful
[53:24] life but this morning
[53:28] we are not doing an
[53:30] entertainment this is a
[53:34] de are you together with me so the
[53:38] people who sing music for
[53:41] entertainment they open flat Gates of
[53:45] Hell amen and brother Bram
[53:49] say most of those
[53:53] entertainers they have two or three
[53:57] that work around their
[54:03] lives two or three of them to keep them
[54:10] stud any
[54:12] music that doesn't praise
[54:15] God it brings
[54:19] depression that's why those guys are on
[54:22] drugs and they on
[54:25] alcohol but holy ghost
[54:27] music brings happiness brings Joy brings
[54:32] deliverance and that's what we want to

[55:19] so to him also there was born a son
[55:25] [Applause]

[55:58] of Amen you are that se that will
[56:04] counteract the
[56:08] cycle not use the music as an
[56:13] entertainment but use the music to call
[56:16] upon
[56:18] God in your
[56:21] music and Christ should be the central
[56:23] theme of your music

[1:01:03] of the
[1:01:05] world Amen that's the way God works in
[1:01:10] Amos and verse
[1:01:13] 11 he says in that
[1:01:16] day I raise up the Tabernacle of David
[1:01:19] that is
[1:01:22] fall and close up the bridge of Z
[1:01:28] and I raise up his
[1:01:31] runes and I build it in the days of
[1:01:36] all the days of
[1:01:39] all now that's a prophetic
[1:01:44] verse in the Book of
[1:01:47] Amos that
[1:01:49] came after the building of the
[1:01:53] Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:01:56] the the building the Tabernacle of David
[1:02:00] which had already
[1:02:03] fallen and already also the one of
[1:02:07] Solomon but God
[1:02:09] promised the Tabernacle of David
[1:02:15] again he says I'll build
[1:02:19] it as in the days of
[1:02:23] War so this Tabernacle in
[1:02:27] Prophecy was related to the Tabernacle
[1:02:30] of
[1:02:32] David in
[1:02:34] Jerusalem and this Tabernacle here did
[1:02:38] not have you know those
[1:02:42] courts it was just one
[1:02:47] building and now all the people entered
[1:02:50] into
[1:02:53] presence hallelujah hallelujah in that
[1:02:56] court of
[1:02:57] David there is no man who says you
[1:03:01] belong to the outer
[1:03:03] Court to the
[1:03:05] middle in the house I mean in the
[1:03:07] Tabernacle of David we all enter into
[1:03:12] presence hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:03:15] that's what David is
[1:03:16] saying in Psalms
[1:03:20] 100 he doesn't understand
[1:03:23] cour he understands into
[1:03:27] presence a tabernacle that was
[1:03:31] open and this
[1:03:33] Tabernacle was built when Christ
[1:03:38] returned during the Feast of
[1:03:41] Pentecost as the Holy Ghost are you
[1:03:45] together with me that is the
[1:03:48] Tabernacle that was
[1:03:50] open to both
[1:03:54] loaves as it was in the Feast of
[1:03:58] Pentecost amen there were two
[1:04:01] Ls the
[1:04:03] Jews and the Gentiles together on the
[1:04:06] fif of Pentecost and the Holy Spirit
[1:04:10] came
[1:04:11] down hallelujah hallelujah a tabernacle
[1:04:15] not bu with
[1:04:17] hands hallelujah hallelujah that's the
[1:04:19] Tabernacle of
[1:04:21] David that brings an all encompassing
[1:04:25] presence
[1:04:30] are you together with me so Acts chapter
[1:04:34] 15 and verse
[1:04:37] 16 this is now he says after
[1:04:45] this I will return they are quoting the
[1:04:47] same prophecy
[1:04:50] now and will build again the Tabernacle
[1:04:54] of David
[1:04:57] which is fallen down and I build again
[1:05:01] the runes
[1:05:07] thereof the resue of
[1:05:10] men may seek after the
[1:05:13] Lord and all the
[1:05:16] Gentiles upon whom my name is
[1:05:19] called say the Lord who does all these
[1:05:24] things hallelujah hallelujah he says
[1:05:27] this
[1:05:28] Tabernacle will be
[1:05:31] spectacular it not be for the Jews
[1:05:34] alone it will be the Gentiles
[1:05:37] too so let me say this good
[1:05:41] afternoon Tabernacle of
[1:05:46] David praise the lord we are the
[1:05:50] Tabernacle of
[1:05:52] David so in the Tabernacle of David
[1:05:56] you know when he was building that
[1:05:58] physical Tabernacle in
[1:06:02] Jerusalem let me tell you what
[1:06:04] happened music went ahead of the
[1:06:08] world to prepare The Souls
[1:06:13] of did you see why I say you should
[1:06:16] never miss the song
[1:06:20] service music opens the
[1:06:24] pathway opens the
[1:06:27] channel itens the
[1:06:29] joy Amen in first
[1:06:34] Chronicles chapter 15 and
[1:06:38] 16 the ark was led into the house of God
[1:06:42] by
[1:06:46] music amen the music opens the CH of Joy
[1:06:50] among the people
[1:06:55] the scripture says break up your fall of
[1:07:05] ground that you may not s in the
[1:07:09] thought so this music here he helps us
[1:07:13] to break the follow
[1:07:16] ground of
[1:07:19] depression sent
[1:07:21] out the sex of the
[1:07:24] Soul they begin to open so
[1:07:27] wide that the Lord
[1:07:30] himself can now speak to your
[1:07:33] soul so in the Tabernacle of
[1:07:36] David we all do a real Ser
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:50] music don't borrow from kan's Beats
[1:07:57] to excite the
[1:08:01] flesh do
[1:08:04] music that will Dig Down The Souls of
[1:08:09] men and remove all spirits of
[1:08:14] evil and
[1:08:17] disease I want to see people healed in
[1:08:20] the
[1:08:21] worship I want see the Holy Ghost come
[1:08:24] down in
[1:08:26] that's what we are here for
[1:08:29] amen music bring him down and takes over
[1:08:35] every ministering gift in the
[1:08:40] house that's what music
[1:08:43] does it takes
[1:08:46] over I want us to look at the impact of
[1:08:49] holy music
[1:08:55] as the dedication of
[1:08:58] Solomon amen you see music as people say
[1:09:04] it's not just a matter of singing
[1:09:08] anything all the people
[1:09:10] see but the
[1:09:13] musicians they are
[1:09:16] extra because they are given a
[1:09:19] gift and the gift
[1:09:23] grows I'm not Happ looking at the men in
[1:09:28] the
[1:09:30] field and their gift doesn't
[1:09:36] grow you know you don't spice it
[1:09:42] up but in the Tabernacle of Moses I mean
[1:09:45] of
[1:09:46] Solomon the dedication of
[1:09:49] it brother the Holy Spirit came and
[1:09:54] Blended the music
[1:09:58] you don't just keep playing off key of
[1:10:01] key
[1:10:07] and my heart is praising
[1:10:11] God you are a
[1:10:13] singer you are a song
[1:10:16] leader but you always off
[1:10:19] key pray Lord help my gift to grow
[1:10:31] are you together with me you wouldn't
[1:10:33] want me here as your
[1:10:37] pastor when I come down here and the
[1:10:41] best thing I

[1:10:53] hallelujah we have seen enough of
[1:10:56] that out there in the
[1:10:58] organization every time a pastor
[1:11:04] comes is doing something strange today
[1:11:08] and people come to hear the same thing
[1:11:13] next there
[1:11:15] something our God is good
[1:11:20] something walk and go
[1:11:24] overseas oh
[1:11:26] you have been
[1:11:27] healed when all of them go
[1:11:31] sick go sick back you see I don't want a
[1:11:37] Ministry like
[1:11:40] that the ministry must
[1:11:44] grow the music must
[1:11:47] grow the music can destroy your
[1:11:52] service brother
[1:11:55] music like in the days of Solomon it can
[1:11:59] take
[1:12:00] over the
[1:12:02] ministers let's go to Second
[1:12:06] chronic 5
[1:12:09] verse it came to
[1:12:12] pass as the
[1:12:15] trumpeters and
[1:12:17] singers were as
[1:12:21] one are you together with
[1:12:24] me musicians are you there the
[1:12:28] trumpeters and the singers were as
[1:12:33] one to make one
[1:12:36] sound to be heard in praising and
[1:12:39] thanking the
[1:12:44] lord and when they lifted up their
[1:12:48] voice with trumpets and
[1:12:52] symbols and instruments of music
[1:12:56] and praise the
[1:12:57] Lord for his
[1:13:00] good for his
[1:13:05] forever house was filled with a
[1:13:10] CL even the house of the Lord so that
[1:13:14] the
[1:13:15] priests could not stand to
[1:13:20] minister by reason of the cloud for the
[1:13:24] glory of the Lord that filled the house
[1:13:26] of the
[1:13:29] Lord can you imagine
[1:13:31] that such a blessed
[1:13:34] presence I desire to see such a song
[1:13:40] service that brings him
[1:13:43] down that it would cause me to step out
[1:13:46] of the
[1:13:48] way that I would not
[1:13:52] Minister but he would Minister
[1:13:57] are you together with me yeah the
[1:14:00] ministers could
[1:14:02] not but today I want such a music
[1:14:08] s that would make Val out of the
[1:14:12] way that the Holy Spirit may speak to
[1:14:17] you amen so music brings down
[1:14:22] motivation it brings down Joy
[1:14:25] it brings down seren
[1:14:29] peace I'll give you this one little
[1:14:33] example as I try to get
[1:14:36] out amen so that we may start the
[1:14:40] worship
[1:14:42] service now Ahab a
[1:14:46] son that he had left behind and his name
[1:14:51] was that began to rule
[1:14:55] and he ruled for 12 years in
[1:15:00] Israel and he started at the 18th
[1:15:04] year of King
[1:15:07] josaphat when he ruled in
[1:15:10] Judah so he deled into some of the evils
[1:15:15] of his
[1:15:18] father much as he put away the image of
[1:15:23] B which his father had
[1:15:28] made but during the time of
[1:15:32] Ahab I mean M the king of
[1:15:39] Moab used to send Ahab 100,000
[1:15:48] [Music]
[1:15:52] LS 100,000
[1:16:04] but Ahab was
[1:16:06] dead when he died the king of Moab
[1:16:14] rebelled against the king of
[1:16:17] Israel
[1:16:20] so the son of
[1:16:22] Ahab organized Israel
[1:16:26] into battle against
[1:16:29] Mo and he as the support of
[1:16:34] jeos just exactly like his
[1:16:37] father had asked for the support of
[1:16:41] jeos to go and
[1:16:47] redeem amen so in that
[1:16:52] Confederation the king of Edom went with
[1:16:56] them but during the charge against
[1:17:02] Moab they lost campus in the desert of
[1:17:11] Edom and you know they were lost for
[1:17:14] seven days without
[1:17:18] water now you see King cry
[1:17:28] the Lord has called these three kings
[1:17:32] together to deliver them into the hands
[1:17:34] of
[1:17:36] Mo so in Second
[1:17:39] Kings 3 and verse
[1:17:43] 11 I think I'll take a
[1:17:48] series on music and
[1:17:52] worship because it's very necessary
[1:17:57] amen he says in verse
[1:18:00] 11
[1:18:03] but this man is speaking about
[1:18:06] death this man here is saying where is
[1:18:15] he he wants to see
[1:18:18] God you know many times when we get into
[1:18:22] situations
[1:18:24] that's higher than
[1:18:26] us you need to start looking for
[1:18:31] God God wants to reveal
[1:18:36] himself but men that don't have
[1:18:40] faith when they get into those kind of
[1:18:46] situations God has delivered this three
[1:18:49] kings into the hands of
[1:18:52] Moab you should always have a postive
[1:18:57] man in the hardest of
[1:19:00] time seek for his
[1:19:03] presence but J
[1:19:06] say is there not here prophet of the
[1:19:10] Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by
[1:19:14] him and one of the kings of one of the
[1:19:19] king of Israel servants answered and
[1:19:22] said
[1:19:26] here is
[1:19:27] elishah the son of
[1:19:30] saf which poured water on the hands of
[1:19:35] el are you together with me you see
[1:19:39] whenever you are in a
[1:19:41] situation God is always moving a
[1:19:47] solution because he knows he has always
[1:19:51] advised you to pray
[1:19:55] whenever you get into a
[1:19:57] situation the answer is not far away
[1:20:00] from
[1:20:02] youen and
[1:20:05] say the word of the Lord is with
[1:20:08] him so the king of
[1:20:11] [Music]
[1:20:13] isra and the king
[1:20:15] of went down to meet
[1:20:18] him and elishah said unto the king of
[1:20:22] Israel what have I to do with
[1:20:26] the is now talking to the son of
[1:20:32] Ahab thee to the prophets of thy
[1:20:40] father and the prophets of thy
[1:20:44] mother and the king of Israel said unto
[1:20:48] him for the Lord has called these three
[1:20:50] kings
[1:20:52] together them into the hand of Moab
[1:20:58] he always insisting on
[1:21:02] thetive and elishah said as the Lord of
[1:21:06] host
[1:21:08] liveth whom I
[1:21:11] stand were it not for I regard the
[1:21:15] presence of josaphat king of
[1:21:20] Judah I would not look toward thee

[3:05:58] Lord I want to greet you all to greet
[3:06:02] you all who are here the Saints of the
[3:06:06] Lord and I'm very
[3:06:08] glad to be part of the youth because I
[3:06:14] also desire to get back to
[3:06:18] that time of
[3:06:19] Innocence praise the name of the
[3:06:22] Lord I composed that song during that
[3:06:25] time of uh uh
[3:06:28] covid uh we had enough time so I had
[3:06:32] enough time to study my sermons and
[3:06:37] sometimes the spirit would come and I
[3:06:40] feel like conforting myself with singing
[3:06:43] you see I like singing more than
[3:06:46] preaching
[3:06:48] I would say praise the name of the Lord
[3:06:51] and uh the inspiration actually I got it
[3:06:54] from my
[3:06:57] pastor we were sharing during that time
[3:07:01] and
[3:07:02] then there is a a quote or something the
[3:07:06] scripture I put on our forum and then
[3:07:11] Pastor had to put there some words he
[3:07:14] didn't know the words he put there would
[3:07:16] get a song Praise the name of the Lord
[3:07:20] so they were his words the
[3:07:24] relics and then me I got a song out of
[3:07:28] them he's he's wondering but he doesn't
[3:07:32] remember praise the name of the Lord so
[3:07:35] uh the
[3:07:39] inspiration you said which one I'm
[3:07:41] beginning
[3:07:42] with times shall be no more praise the
[3:07:46] name of the Lord
[3:07:48] uh time shall be no more the inspiration
[3:07:52] uh I got
[3:07:54] from uh the Ephesians chapter
[3:07:59] 5 verse
[3:08:01] 15 16 and
[3:08:05] 19 it
[3:08:07] says see then that you walk
[3:08:12] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[3:08:16] Redeeming the time because the days are
[3:08:19] evil
[3:08:21] wherefore be ye not unwise but
[3:08:25] understanding what the
[3:08:28] will what the will of the Lord
[3:08:33] is and then verse
[3:08:37] 19 speaking to yourselves in
[3:08:40] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[3:08:45] singing and making melody in your heart
[3:08:50] to the
[3:08:52] Lord amen and then I got a quote
[3:08:58] from the
[3:08:59] message
[3:09:04] Shalom praise the name of the
[3:09:07] Lord no excuse me I'm mixing them up
[3:09:12] here because I have two songs
[3:09:19] amen uh the quote is from
[3:09:26] uh Divine
[3:09:28] Healing I I get it here from her amen
[3:09:33] because I had sent on her phone Divine
[3:09:37] Healing I says and
[3:09:43] Jesus and Jesus the very last Commission
[3:09:47] he gave he give was go into all the
[3:09:51] world and
[3:09:53] preach this gospel to Every
[3:09:57] Creature I'll read it from there can you
[3:10:00] see then friend why can't you stay home
[3:10:06] there is
[3:10:08] just something in me tearing me to
[3:10:12] pieces I realize something is got to be
[3:10:16] done
[3:10:19] brother
[3:10:21] sister we uh I can't do it myself and I
[3:10:25] don't know
[3:10:27] what I see these missionary
[3:10:30] societies and how they fold up and fail
[3:10:33] and everything else over there because
[3:10:37] they
[3:10:38] got uh because they got the wrong thing
[3:10:41] to go with over there with
[3:10:45] theology well them people laughes at you
[3:10:50] can't go over there with theology they
[3:10:53] don't even believe that stuff you've got
[3:10:58] to show them that God is God that's
[3:11:02] right praise the name of the Lord so uh
[3:11:06] we need to go and preach the
[3:11:10] gospel paragraph
[3:11:12] 59 give it to me praise the name of the
[3:11:16] Lord it says
[3:11:18] and what can I what can a person
[3:11:22] do I
[3:11:24] don't I don't know but I know one of
[3:11:29] these days it will all be
[3:11:32] over and the trumpet of the Lord shall
[3:11:36] sound and say time shall be no more
[3:11:42] praise the name of the
[3:11:43] Lord and that's the inspiration from the

[3:20:22] those are the words I told you I got
[3:20:24] from
[3:20:25] Pastor
[3:20:26] amen and I got a lyric out of it a song
[3:20:30] out of
[3:20:31] it the inspiration is from Matthew
[3:20:34] chapter
[3:20:35] 18 verse 2 and
[3:20:38] 3 where
[3:20:40] Jesus was brought the child and says and
[3:20:45] Jesus called a little child unto him and
[3:20:48] set him in the midst of
[3:20:51] them and said verily I say unto you
[3:20:56] except you be
[3:20:58] converted and become as a child as a
[3:21:00] little children you shall not enter into
[3:21:04] the kingdom of
[3:21:06] heaven and uh we have Isaiah 11 chapter
[3:21:11] 11 verse 2
[3:21:13] 3 up to verse 2 up to 6
[3:21:18] we shall read and the spirit of the Lord
[3:21:22] shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom
[3:21:26] and understanding the spirit of counsel
[3:21:29] and might the spirit of knowledge and of
[3:21:32] the fear of the Lord and righteousness
[3:21:37] shall be the GLE of his loins and
[3:21:40] faithfulness the G of his Reigns The
[3:21:45] Wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and
[3:21:49] the leopard shall lie down with the kid
[3:21:53] and the cow and the Young Lion and the
[3:21:58] firstling
[3:21:59] together and a little child shall lead
[3:22:04] them the
[3:22:06] inspiration from the message of the hour
[3:22:10] I get it from the message Shalom
[3:22:12] preached
[3:22:13] 1964 in January 12th
[3:22:17] and he
[3:22:18] says there will be a
[3:22:21] millennium the old will be young there
[3:22:25] forever amen sickness will fade
[3:22:28] away and death will be no
[3:22:32] more they shall build houses they will
[3:22:35] inhabit them they will plant Vineyards
[3:22:39] and eat the fruit thereof they will not
[3:22:43] plant and another inhabit his son
[3:22:47] take it his son will be living by him he
[3:22:52] will not plant and another itss die off
[3:22:57] or somebody else take it but he'll live
[3:23:02] there amen the wolf and the lamb shall
[3:23:07] feed together and the lion shall eat
[3:23:10] straw like the Bullock and a child shall
[3:23:14] lead them around there will be there
[3:23:18] will be
[3:23:20] innocence there will be there will be
[3:23:23] nothing good Hur we will be changed from
[3:23:27] what we are now to that glorious image
[3:23:30] of the Son of God which is manful which
[3:23:34] is Immortal years can never touch him
[3:23:38] age can never do anything to him he is
[3:23:43] the immortal Son of God so so we know
[3:23:48] that we were we are at the end time we
[3:23:53] are living at the junction all these
[3:23:56] things thoroughly identified so will it
[3:24:00] be identified

[3:42:43] brother Joseph the
[3:42:46] who has just left the stage I happen to
[3:42:49] be one of the few blessed people that
[3:42:51] have had that song five years ago and
[3:42:55] actually we did a do it of
[3:42:57] it so I'm really blessed by that
[3:43:01] song um
[3:43:18] uh we have two
[3:43:20] songs but before that there's a song
[3:43:24] that uh got put in my
[3:43:26] spirit um towards the end of last year I
[3:43:30] think from uh 28th to 31st and it has
[3:43:35] been playing in my heart I think it's
[3:43:38] because it speak to my situation that I
[3:43:41] was in during that time and it's one of
[3:43:43] the songs from here
[3:43:46] and uh I used to call it uh I'm not a
[3:43:49] stranger to the
[3:43:51] valley but when they upload the video
[3:43:53] they called it Valley so but it's okay
[3:43:58] so if you would allow I'd like to sing
[3:44:00] just one verse and uh just a chorus I'm
[3:44:04] going to uh I'm not going to sing the
[3:44:06] whole verse just I'll begin from the
[3:44:09] middle he
[3:44:11] say I'll sing a capella so musicians
[3:44:14] don't worry
[3:44:18] I've come
[3:44:20] toiz for to my life he has to bring me
[3:44:27] out and remake me
[3:44:30] again I say to you my
[3:44:34] friend be sure that
[3:44:37] everything will
[3:44:40] for your
[3:44:43] good I'm our stranger to the
[3:44:51] valley I V this Ro
[3:44:58] before I
[3:45:01] on and i' fallen on my face but I to
[3:45:07] right
[3:45:08] up
[3:45:12] again it's not my strength
[3:45:15] [Music]
[3:45:20] a strength I have in
[3:45:23] [Music]
[3:45:25] Christ oh I pray for you my friend and
[3:45:31] our land helping
[3:45:33] her we'll make it
[3:45:36] all
[3:45:39] together bless
[3:45:43] you so the first song I will sing is
[3:45:46] called
[3:45:47] theoo is a song that I Got U from uh a
[3:45:52] message which I forgot I forgot where I
[3:45:54] put my notes but uh it was preached by
[3:45:58] Pastor charie
[3:46:00] Emmanuel and uh I was talking about a
[3:46:03] race that Christians are in a race but
[3:46:07] you have three techniques that you have
[3:46:08] to use in that race the first one is
[3:46:12] patience the next is endurance and then
[3:46:15] the last one is
[3:46:17] abandonment so in this song We're
[3:46:19] exploring those Concepts and I think
[3:46:22] that they encompassed in the
[3:46:27] chorus the first inspiration is from uh
[3:46:31] Hebrews 12 verse
[3:46:34] 1 it says wherefore seeing we also are
[3:46:40] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[3:46:43] witnesses
[3:46:45] let us lay aside every weight and the
[3:46:48] sin which that easily beset us and let
[3:46:52] us run with patience the race that is
[3:46:56] set before us so one of the techniques
[3:46:59] is patience you have to run with
[3:47:01] patience then another one is from uh
[3:47:04] First Corinthians
[3:47:06] 9:24 know ye not that ye which run in a
[3:47:10] race run all but one Rees the price so
[3:47:16] run that he may obtain and every man
[3:47:20] that strives for the Mastery is
[3:47:23] temperate in all things now they do it
[3:47:26] to obtain a corruptible Crown but we are
[3:47:30] uncorruptible I therefore so
[3:47:34] run not as
[3:47:36] uncertainly so fight I not as the one
[3:47:40] that Beth the air but I keep my body and
[3:47:44] bring it into subjection lest that by
[3:47:47] any means when I have preached to others
[3:47:51] I myself should be a Cast
[3:47:53] Away now that that uh
[3:47:56] verse um it inspired second chorus where
[3:48:00] we about
[3:48:18] so you have to bring your body under
[3:48:19] subjection in that place then the last
[3:48:23] inspiration is from uh the message
[3:48:26] called the years of our pilgrimage there
[3:48:30] a message which was preached by our
[3:48:32] pastor here
[3:48:34] Pastor during our
[3:48:36] convention last year and I caught I
[3:48:40] don't have a recording but I caught it
[3:48:42] my head he said keep on holding firm
[3:48:46] every victory that you get maturity
[3:48:49] doesn't come in a in one day it's a
[3:48:53] journey and that's why I picked the
[3:48:55] inspiration for the last verse where I
[3:48:58] talk about
[3:49:01] uh as
[3:49:06] running the little
[3:49:09] victories so uh when you can't be uh
[3:49:15] 100% but you have to keep on holding
[3:49:19] every little victory that you
[3:49:22] get there's also I think I I skip this
[3:49:25] scripture but it's still in relation to
[3:49:27] the that verse and I think P also talked
[3:49:31] about it he said that hold fast that
[3:49:33] which thou Hast that no man may take thy
[3:49:36] Crown from Revelation chapter 3 verse
[3:49:40] 11 then he also said that U from Peter
[3:49:45] second Peter verse
[3:49:47] one uh chapter 1 verse
[3:49:51] 5-7 add to your faith virtue and to
[3:49:54] Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[3:49:56] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[3:49:59] and to patience godliness and to

[3:50:11] perfect man you you can't be perfect one
[3:50:15] day you have to keep on adding those are
[3:50:17] the small victories we are singing
[3:50:19] about and
[3:50:22] uh uh when I was reading this scripture
[3:50:25] I remember the concept which Pastor here
[3:50:28] pastor always talks about he always
[3:50:30] talks about an
[3:50:32] overlap and an overlap is uh is
[3:50:36] basically uh a
[3:50:39] concept where there is an intersection
[3:50:41] or a sharing of
[3:50:46] characteristics and sometimes
[3:50:48] principles so from the what that this
[3:50:52] song There's an overlap in this
[3:50:54] song with the F the song that I first
[3:50:57] suang here called we need love so when I
[3:51:00] read that on top of all that that we
[3:51:03] listed in second Peter you have to add
[3:51:06] charity which is the cstone on a perfect
[3:51:09] man I remember that song we need love so
[3:51:13] yeah the concept is a
[3:51:15] God bless you

[3:57:13] for for
[3:57:18] [Music]
[3:57:56] [Music]
[3:57:58] the next song is called Reckless
[3:58:01] Faith uh the inspiration the first
[3:58:03] inspiration is from Joshua 1 to
[3:58:08] 5 chapter 1 verse to
[3:58:12] 5 um there shall shall not any man be
[3:58:15] able to stand before thee older days of
[3:58:18] thy
[3:58:19] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[3:58:24] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[3:58:28] forsake
[3:58:29] thee and I have a quote from uh the
[3:58:33] message called as I was with Moses I'll
[3:58:36] will be with
[3:58:38] thee uh preached by Brother Branham in
[3:58:42] Jefferson ofil Indiana USA uh paragraphs
[3:58:47] 49 to
[3:58:50] 50 paragraphs 49 says now Joshua in all
[3:58:55] this knowing that the command was great
[3:58:59] but having the Assurance he could be
[3:59:02] Fearless he could be as we would call it
[3:59:06] Reckless as long as he was pointed the
[3:59:09] right way he might break up against a
[3:59:12] hill that would not KN him backwards but
[3:59:15] he was carried the right
[3:59:21] way so can the Church of the Living God
[3:59:23] be Reckless and Fe and fearless in faith
[3:59:27] if we are appointed the right way for he
[3:59:30] said as I was with Moses I will be with
[3:59:34] you I will not fail you nor forsake you
[3:59:38] he never forsaken Moses he will not fail
[3:59:43] Joshua he will not fail us he will be
[3:59:46] with
[3:59:48] us now you may be
[3:59:51] wondering what does reckless
[3:59:54] mean uh Reckless I Des prob it as just
[3:59:57] an
[3:59:59] impulsive
[4:00:01] actions when your actions are
[4:00:04] impulsive you can be termed as
[4:00:07] Reckless or maybe to simplify it in
[4:00:10] general is acting without thinking
[4:00:14] or considering the consequences so way
[4:00:17] your faith should be like that you
[4:00:19] shouldn't have to see what is around you
[4:00:21] to believe for something believe for it
[4:00:24] anyway God bless
[4:00:33] you why should you
[4:00:37] cry when you can
[4:00:41] speak whatever you bu

[4:29:18] God comes close to
[4:29:20] us I think that's one of the greatest
[4:29:23] Troubles of the people of this day we
[4:29:25] have too many other things on our minds
[4:29:28] even when we come to the healing service
[4:29:30] we seem to think well I did not get a
[4:29:33] prayer card tonight or perhaps I will
[4:29:36] not be prayed
[4:29:37] for we will never be able to accomplish
[4:29:40] much as long as we keep those kind of
[4:29:44] thoughts this angelous Temple is
[4:29:46] thirsting for the outbreak of the Holy
[4:29:48] Spirit not only that but the whole
[4:29:51] United States speaking of the Christian
[4:29:54] R is waiting for Revival in our time but
[4:29:57] we are waiting for something to happen
[4:29:59] and I believe that God has let it happen
[4:30:02] and we are just so pushing it somewhere
[4:30:04] else until it will pass over us and our
[4:30:07] time of Grace will be gone let's be
[4:30:10] positive in our thinking
[4:30:12] let's believe that this night now the
[4:30:16] Revival will break in Angeles Temple
[4:30:19] tonight let's believe that this is the
[4:30:22] night that God will do the
[4:30:25] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[4:30:28] could do or think he will do it tonight
[4:30:32] don't take no further the answer it's
[4:30:36] when you think those things you create
[4:30:38] an atmosphere around you and as she was
[4:30:43] thinking on this that's Mary and as she
[4:30:47] was thinking on this she raised up her
[4:30:49] eyes and she thought that she saw a
[4:30:52] light Flicker and a little virgin
[4:30:54] perhaps rubbed her lovely angel looking
[4:30:57] eyes and she looked around and well
[4:31:00] maybe it was the Sun that kindly
[4:31:02] reflected off or something and she goes
[4:31:05] on and turns the corner starting up
[4:31:07] towards the public well she drops her
[4:31:09] little head again and pulls her little
[4:31:11] way well around her shoulders and she
[4:31:14] went on about her way thinking of what
[4:31:18] did Isaiah 96
[4:31:21] mean when God put something upon a
[4:31:24] person's heart he's ready to do
[4:31:27] something that's the reason that he's
[4:31:30] ready to give the angelous temple an
[4:31:32] outbreak of the spirit because it's on
[4:31:36] your
[4:31:37] heart and as she thought on these things
[4:31:40] after a while she rised up head again
[4:31:42] she felt a little strange feeling I just
[4:31:45] love to feel the presence of the Holy
[4:31:48] Spirit it just gives that Blessed
[4:31:51] Assurance you don't always have to see
[4:31:53] it it's there anyhow and as she moved
[4:31:57] along she raised her head again and
[4:31:59] there stood this great light before her
[4:32:02] perhaps the Temple of fire that led the
[4:32:03] children of Israel come walking from the
[4:32:06] light came forth an Archangel Gabriel
[4:32:10] and he said Hil Mary
[4:32:12] means to stop blessed art thou among the
[4:32:16] women hard telling the other women went
[4:32:19] to the well that morning perhaps
[4:32:21] thinking about washing as they had to do
[4:32:24] and some task or some Society in the
[4:32:27] church they had to take care of but Mary
[4:32:30] was thinking on the scriptures was not
[4:32:33] in clopas and his friend on the first
[4:32:35] Easter morning as they were thinking on
[4:32:38] the scriptures when Jesus appeared to
[4:32:40] them and as she saw this great Angel it
[4:32:44] startled the little virgin she stopped
[4:32:47] and she come close to her and he come
[4:32:50] close to her and saluted her and he gave
[4:32:53] her a message that was a hard message
[4:32:55] for the child to believe for she wasn't
[4:32:58] nothing but a girl and he gave her
[4:33:01] something to believe and was more
[4:33:03] outstanding and had to believe than
[4:33:06] anything he would ever give to anyone
[4:33:09] six months ago before that he would met
[4:33:11] Zacharia the priest at the temple and he
[4:33:13] was at the Ed an edged man and had read
[4:33:16] the scriptures and had Tau the
[4:33:18] scriptures and because that he was old
[4:33:21] and his wife was baren the angel same
[4:33:24] Angel told him after the days of
[4:33:28] ministration at the altar waving the
[4:33:31] incense over the people's prayers that
[4:33:33] when he went home his wife would
[4:33:36] conceive and bear a child and that
[4:33:39] preacher questioned the angel how can it
[4:33:42] be I'm old and my wife is old he had
[4:33:45] plenty of examples in the Bible there
[4:33:48] had been Hana at the temple that had
[4:33:51] Samuel the prophet after she was old and
[4:33:54] there had been Sarah who brought forth
[4:33:56] Isaac after she was nearly 100 years old
[4:33:59] and here this little had to believe
[4:34:02] something that had never happened a
[4:34:05] woman having a baby without knowing any
[4:34:08] man she said how shall these things be
[4:34:11] my Lord Lord he said the Holy Ghost
[4:34:13] shall overshadow thee and that thing
[4:34:16] that will be born from you will be
[4:34:18] called The Son of God watch her she
[4:34:21] didn't question that she said behold the
[4:34:24] handmade of the Lord be itto me
[4:34:28] according to Thy word and if we just do
[4:34:31] that that's the only thing that's what
[4:34:35] God loves that's the only way to get
[4:34:38] right with God is take him at his word
[4:34:43] that's the only way that there is the to
[4:34:45] please God to take his word don't trust
[4:34:48] your knowledge you reason how can it be
[4:34:53] done it cannot be
[4:34:55] done when you reason you lose the
[4:34:58] victory we must cast down reasoning and
[4:35:01] believe what God has said to be the
[4:35:04] truth Mary took him at his word and he
[4:35:07] changed the whole course of natural life
[4:35:10] for her he will change the course of
[4:35:13] your life tonight if you will take him
[4:35:15] at his word if you are a sinner he will
[4:35:19] straighten that crooked life of yours

[5:38:19] return uh the rest of the paraffin to
[5:38:22] where we used to keep it away from the
[5:38:25] house it was in The
[5:38:27] Farmhouse and little did he know that
[5:38:31] the two little girls my
[5:38:34] grandchildren that is
[5:38:38] RMA and Salma they were just around and
[5:38:43] they share everything they get they were
[5:38:46] two and three at the time and so you
[5:38:50] know Sarah gets the B of paraffin drinks
[5:38:56] it and then gives to her sister and now
[5:39:01] they started falling back lack of oxygen
[5:39:04] and they were chocking it was such a
[5:39:08] shock when my wife in the kitchen
[5:39:12] screamed and said hurry we came and they
[5:39:15] were coughing they were completely out
[5:39:19] of oxygen supply there was such a panic
[5:39:24] we put them in the car I started drive
[5:39:28] hoting so bad that everybody has to get
[5:39:32] out of the way and we get to
[5:39:35] hospital at that particular time
[5:39:38] there was such a jam on the road many
[5:39:41] trucks back and forth I had to drive
[5:39:46] pushing through and then as we were
[5:39:49] driving Faith was crying that Rema is
[5:39:54] dying and she was literally going the
[5:39:58] eyes were rolling up and now I said
[5:40:01] where is she place my hand so I placed
[5:40:06] the hand we were praying as we're going
[5:40:08] forth and by the time we got to the
[5:40:11] hospital it was such an emergence the
[5:40:14] quanti that was ingested was big and we
[5:40:18] really didn't know how and why but by
[5:40:22] Grace we reached there they put them on
[5:40:25] oxygen to excel that you know paraffin
[5:40:30] and they were telling us the worst
[5:40:32] mistake we did was to force milk in Ron
[5:40:37] and she was so bad L because we had the
[5:40:40] idea Mir would expel it and then for S
[5:40:45] she was such a tough girl that she
[5:40:48] refused the milk in that kind of time
[5:40:52] she was a fighter she couldn't take it
[5:40:55] and then when we took them to hospital
[5:40:58] you know Rema was in such a bad
[5:41:00] situation all the you know Exel was
[5:41:06] paraffin the water urine was paraffin
[5:41:10] the back was paraffin and it was so bad
[5:41:14] they were on oxyen for three days the
[5:41:17] Lord delivered them so as we were
[5:41:21] going Faith started singing these words
[5:41:25] of the song that she's going to sing now
[5:41:28] I don't know whether she has ever sung
[5:41:30] it before but it was pleading to the
[5:41:33] Lord that God would save us from two
