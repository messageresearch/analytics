[26:44] and
[26:47] years you
[26:49] know myself I'm only 32 years
[26:54] old and I've uh preached this message
[26:57] for for about 17
[27:01] years and that will tell you this almost
[27:04] half my life more than half my
[27:08] life so the message is my
[27:11] life and I just want to you to know that
[27:13] I love the message with all my
[27:17] heart found me when I was on the on the
[27:20] road becoming a
[27:23] priest having ministered um in the
[27:26] Anglican Church for
[27:28] two
[27:30] years as a l preacher the bishop I was
[27:33] leaving with the bishop and he put me to
[27:38] preaching I don't know whether Pastor
[27:40] knew that so I preached for two years in
[27:42] the Anglican
[27:45] Church from the age of 1 years 14 years
[27:50] and then at
[27:51] 15 God sent the message my
[27:54] way and it was not easy for me to accept
[27:59] but but you know there was different
[28:02] encounters that I
[28:04] got and uh but I would just speak of
[28:07] this one specific
[28:10] one uh we were you know I would always
[28:13] go to my Anglican Church very early in
[28:15] the
[28:17] morning and then uh in the mid morning I
[28:21] would go to the message
[28:24] church because I was leaving with the
[28:28] pastor of in the message at the
[28:32] time and uh and so I was forced to go to
[28:36] a message Church in the in the afternoon
[28:38] because we did not I didn't have any
[28:40] other home to go
[28:45] to but you see this one
[28:48] morning when I went to my Anglican
[28:52] Church I was just
[28:54] SE like just over on that door
[28:58] there and there was just like there is
[29:03] here and so we were just standing a
[29:07] woman preacher was on the pull
[29:10] pit and then he you know by here by
[29:13] seeing a preach I already knew it was
[29:17] wrong because I had already heard of it
[29:20] being told to
[29:21] me and then I also saw them baptizing in
[29:25] the
[29:26] back
[29:28] uh there was a Baptist
[29:31] tree how many were in the Anglican
[29:33] Church here raise up your
[29:35] hand you can understand what I'm talking
[29:38] about and they they brought a little
[29:41] child and they said name this
[29:45] child and a Godfather named the
[29:48] child and I started asking the child
[29:52] will you uh you know forit the word blah
[29:54] blah blah blah
[29:56] blah Jesus
[29:58] Christ the little child
[30:03] say but the big man
[30:06] answered when that happened you know I
[30:09] knew this was the biggest deception in
[30:11] the
[30:13] world they're asking a
[30:15] baby but the adult is
[30:18] answering so but then in that moment I
[30:22] began to feel a bit
[30:23] different I was feeling a bit
[30:26] dizzy
[30:27] and I felt that I was almost going to
[30:30] pass
[30:31] out and then a voice came out of a wall
[30:34] of wind that came around my
[30:37] ears and he spoke to me by
[30:42] name find the nearest
[30:44] exit and leave this place you are in the
[30:48] wrong place those were the words I heard
[30:51] and I'm a faithful
[30:53] witness and when I heard those words I
[30:56] could not believe
[30:58] it was only me hearing so I turned
[31:01] around and
[31:02] looked but the third time when that came
[31:05] back I could not resist it I quickly
[31:09] Swang my way out I Pi my B and I Swang
[31:11] my way
[31:12] out and I landed in the message church I
[31:15] had nowhere else to
[31:17] go and uh when I reached the message
[31:20] church I had not yet beli I had decided
[31:23] to to leave the
[31:26] denomination I had not yet decided to
[31:28] join the Believers of the
[31:31] message but here I found a man
[31:34] preaching as if he had CS under his
[31:39] foot you know and he was preaching under
[31:41] a lot of
[31:43] inspiration and you know it was a
[31:45] brother called Paul at the
[31:47] time you know
[31:50] preached my heart
[31:52] melted and and and you know you know
[31:55] just as they were closing the service
[31:58] the same of wind came
[32:04] back and I became busy
[32:07] again and out of that voice out of that
[32:11] wall of
[32:14] wind another voice came and they called
[32:18] me again by my name and he
[32:21] said stand up on your feet raise up both
[32:25] your hands and declare to these people
[32:29] that you have accepted the
[32:32] message and that you would like to be
[32:34] baptized in the name of Jesus
[32:37] Christ when when I heard that
[32:42] iated in my Anglican
[32:44] Church I was already
[32:47] ministering I was having I was in good
[32:49] graes with the bishop and the AR Bishop
[32:51] of
[32:53] Uganda I prom to take me to study
[32:56] theology so I can become a
[33:00] priest in the USA so I knew these were
[33:04] opportunities that I was going to lose
[33:05] and I would never get them
[33:08] again the church inana was at that time
[33:11] very
[33:13] little 10 to 15
[33:16] people with even the iron sheets were
[33:19] leaking
[33:21] sometimes so I was in my heart I was in
[33:24] my mind I was
[33:25] reasoning
[33:27] what here there is no
[33:29] future if I I follow what the voice is
[33:32] telling
[33:33] me I'm ring my
[33:36] life but then again that voice came the
[33:40] second
[33:40] time and that voice came the third
[33:43] time friends I just became very
[33:47] emotional and that's why I always say
[33:49] it's okay to be
[33:51] emotional the holy spirit is not
[33:54] emotional but he is
[33:57] emotional when you receive that
[34:00] experience you become
[34:02] emotional I did not want to be excited
[34:05] or
[34:07] emotional but I became
[34:09] emotional and and you know tears were
[34:11] just coming out of my
[34:13] eyes and and then I I just you know
[34:16] shakingly raised up one of my
[34:19] hands and I tried to shout but I think I
[34:22] couldn't
[34:24] shout and I spoke and said I've accepted
[34:28] this message to be the truth and i'
[34:31] would like to be baptized in the name of
[34:33] Jesus
[34:34] Christ all the people began clapping and
[34:38] shouting and I was moved I wondered
[34:41] whether it was a great thing for
[34:44] them I was amazed at their
[34:47] Joy friends we should always be joyful
[34:49] when God Saves a
[34:53] sin and so I was saved that day
[34:57] and I was taken to the
[34:59] water and I was
[35:01] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[35:03] Christ at 15 years and when I came out
[35:07] of the water I made a resolution in my
[35:10] heart I said I'm going to
[35:13] go all over the world all over the
[35:16] country wherever the Lord will take and
[35:19] I will tell the people that there is a
[35:22] message in the
[35:23] land and ever

[41:55] legacy
[41:57] praise
[41:58] God praise
[42:00] God praise
[42:02] God I saw brother William
[42:05] somewhere brother William was with us in

[42:13] the and baptized a few people
[42:17] there praise God so uh beneficiaries
[42:19] ofua
[42:22] Legacy now I want us to see that the
[42:25] blessing on the life of a good
[42:29] man he is so great
[42:32] enough that upon his death he has enough
[42:37] left to give an
[42:40] inheritance not only to his
[42:42] children but also to his
[42:45] grandchildren maybe some of you seated
[42:49] here have ever inherited something from
[42:53] your
[42:55] father now a legacy is a
[43:00] Heritage now a Heritage is something
[43:03] that is handed down from the
[43:07] past it may be
[43:10] property it may be
[43:13] reputation it may be
[43:16] Traditions it may be positions in
[43:19] life aacy is something that is handed
[43:23] down from the
[43:25] past
[43:28] to another
[43:29] generation if your father had
[43:32] lands or
[43:34] houses or
[43:37] Estes and then he passed away now Legacy
[43:41] is what he leaves you
[43:44] with is what you
[43:47] inherit now a good man lives a
[43:51] legacy a legacy that goes beyond the
[43:54] first generation
[43:57] and On to the Next
[43:59] Generation you know there is listen to
[44:01] me Church there is something that is
[44:03] very
[44:05] serious that not very many people take
[44:09] seriously and that is
[44:12] death death is
[44:13] serious I know we are believers and we
[44:16] are waiting on for the
[44:18] Rapture how many are waiting for the
[44:20] Rapture the rupture will come for
[44:23] sure the rupture is also serious
[44:26] the rupture is going to happen but not
[44:30] many
[44:31] people are going to go in the
[44:33] Rapture even Apostle Paul was waiting
[44:36] for the
[44:37] RT he died believing and
[44:40] waiting we believe we will be
[44:43] ruptur but some of us may go the way of
[44:46] the
[44:48] Grave if the Lord
[44:50] tiries and so death is a
[44:53] reality but many people live as though
[44:56] There Is No
[44:58] Death they only think for themselves and
[45:01] think about
[45:03] themselves they don't think about
[45:05] tomorrow they don't think about what
[45:07] will
[45:08] happen after they are
[45:10] gone and but but but a good
[45:14] man thinks about
[45:16] tomorrow a good man thinks about his
[45:21] legacy and and a good man you know
[45:24] prepares uh a legacy that the generation
[45:28] after him will be able to
[45:34] inherit he wants to be sure there is an
[45:37] everlasting
[45:39] blessing this blessing that he
[45:42] leaves he doesn't listen he doesn't
[45:45] leave it only for the first
[45:47] generation but it comes to the first
[45:50] generation onto the Next
[45:52] Generation and another generation all
[45:56] become
[45:58] beneficiaries of this good
[46:01] man praise the name of the Lord now he
[46:05] does it on
[46:07] purpose and I want to ask you a question
[46:09] here
[46:10] today what will you be remembered
[46:14] for ask your neighbor what will you be
[46:16] remembered
[46:18] for did you know one time right now you
[46:22] may consider yourself a young
[46:24] person
[46:26] but time is coming and it's coming
[46:29] first when you will be an old
[46:34] man when you'll be an old
[46:37] woman when you are stoop
[46:40] shoulder and and you cannot do anything
[46:43] for
[46:44] yourself what will he be remembered
[46:47] for when you are out of this
[46:49] world will your name be remembered
[46:53] anymore what will you leave behind
[46:56] whatever you will leave behind is going
[46:59] to be your
[47:02] legacy if you have a
[47:05] vision it is no longer about you but the
[47:09] Legacy behind
[47:11] you and I want to say thank
[47:14] God for the men of God that had have had
[47:18] Vision this building here this church
[47:22] here this people here they all here
[47:25] because there is a man that had
[47:28] Vision this entire region and many parts
[47:32] in the
[47:33] country been
[47:35] evangelized even me myself I may not
[47:38] have directly come from the ministry
[47:41] here but if this ministry did not
[47:44] go and many others that went out at
[47:48] fast when they had this message and they
[47:52] believed it if they had no vision
[47:56] to continue preaching that
[47:59] message for the Next
[48:01] Generation we will not be here and I
[48:04] want to say thank God for men with
[48:08] vision thank God thank God for and there
[48:13] there have been many men all over the
[48:16] world many
[48:18] Ministry that have had
[48:20] vision for the message to go
[48:24] for but the question is do we have
[48:28] Vision we
[48:30] ourselves many people have Inherited
[48:33] property especially here in our
[48:35] country some of you that have been
[48:38] following the trends of our country you
[48:41] can see that there's been several
[48:44] families that have men that have made a
[48:48] name and a big
[48:51] Fortune when the man
[48:53] died he died in
[48:57] the children would begin selling one by
[49:00] one they would begin selling the lands
[49:04] they begin selling the
[49:05] business they'll begin selling
[49:08] everything all the houses the Estates
[49:11] the car and soon the family gos into
[49:17] poverty why because the generation that
[49:20] came
[49:21] after did not have a
[49:24] vision but when you have a
[49:27] vision you are going to not think about
[49:31] yourself
[49:33] anymore you are not going to be
[49:36] selfish you are going to think about
[49:39] others you are going to think about
[49:41] another
[49:44] generation do you know we have young men
[49:48] and young
[49:50] ladies 20
[49:53] years 25
[49:56] and they have even the thought of
[49:57] marriage has never crossed to
[50:02] them when you ask them about
[50:05] it
[50:06] brother I'm still making
[50:09] money and you know we are still seeking
[50:12] for God and we want to be right with God
[50:15] and brother you have no
[50:18] vision sister you have no
[50:21] vision you are not going to wait for you
[50:23] to be married to pray for your husband
[50:24] or to pray for your
[50:28] wife Vision looks to the
[50:30] Future before things happen you see what
[50:34] others are not seeing you begin planning
[50:38] you begin preparing you begin praying
[50:41] you begin doing everything that it
[50:43] takes to prepare
[50:45] yourself for the future and even so not
[50:50] for
[50:50] yourself to prepare for those that will
[50:54] come after you
[50:59] praise
[51:01] God if there is
[51:03] something that white people are better
[51:07] than
[51:08] us is that many of them think about
[51:13] Legacy I was in Zimbabwe
[51:16] recently especially in the guu
[51:20] areas Southern Zimbabwe and and a pastor
[51:24] that was hosting me there saying
[51:28] as we're driving
[51:29] around this was one of the industrial
[51:31] the biggest industrial cities of places
[51:34] in Zimbabwe at the time when the whites
[51:36] were still
[51:39] there the old place was
[51:42] flourishing great compounds great rods
[51:46] the
[51:49] infrastructure but when they
[51:52] left local people you know you know they
[51:56] they they made
[51:59] Gardens the gardens which were with
[52:01] flowers and you know looking so
[52:03] beautiful
[52:05] and they planted
[52:08] Maze and so now you would look
[52:11] around the maze is also a bit a bit a
[52:14] bit
[52:15] red he doesn't look
[52:17] fruitful and he and he told me the
[52:21] brother told me our people only think
[52:22] about
[52:24] food
[52:26] what I will eat today but I don't think
[52:29] about
[52:31] tomorrow there's something that God has
[52:33] given to me to challenge the younger
[52:37] generation and I don't know if I'll
[52:39] preach that much but I just want to
[52:40] deliver
[52:42] it and by by God's grace be able to
[52:46] inspire our young
[52:48] people but you see what what will you be
[52:50] remembered
[52:53] for and let us look at at Ephesians chap
[52:56] 1:
[53:01] 3 we're going to read a few verses out
[53:03] of
[53:05] that blessed be the God and father of
[53:08] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[53:10] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[53:12] bles in
[53:19] Christ according as he has chosen Us in
[53:21] him before the foundation of the world
[53:24] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[53:26] before him in
[53:34] love praise God five having
[53:39] pre
[53:41] predestinated okay let us look at
[53:44] four we read
[53:46] four all right five have been predent as
[53:49] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[53:51] Christ himself according to the good
[53:53] pleasure of his will
[54:01] seven in whom we have Redemption through
[54:04] his blood the Forgiveness of sins
[54:07] according to the riches of his
[54:11] [Music]
[54:18] grace having made known unto us the
[54:21] mystery of his will according to his
[54:23] good pleasure which he purposed in
[54:34] himself that in the
[54:37] dispensation of the fullness of
[54:39] time he might gather together in one all
[54:42] things in
[54:45] Christ both which are in
[54:48] heaven and which are on earth even in
[54:52] him in whom also we have obtained an
[54:59] inheritance praise God being
[55:04] predestinated according to the purpose
[55:06] of him who work all things after the
[55:09] councel of his own
[55:13] way our
[55:15] inheritance is in Jesus Christ Our
[55:19] inheritance is in Christ and I want to
[55:23] say what did he come to do
[55:25] he came down here he came from Heaven to
[55:28] Earth and there's many ways this can be
[55:32] approached and please understand I'm
[55:34] another
[55:35] teacher and so if I don't bring it the
[55:37] way your pastor does understand me
[55:41] please that amen just Spirit receive the
[55:44] way
[55:45] com so listen when he came down he came
[55:49] down from
[55:50] glory and he came down to us what did he
[55:54] come to do
[55:55] he came to establish an everlasting
[56:00] Legacy how did he do that on a hill far
[56:05] away stood an Old Rugged
[56:08] Cross an emblem of
[56:11] suffering and shame you cannot establish
[56:15] a
[56:17] legacy without
[56:19] suffering and I love that old
[56:22] gross where the Dearest and
[56:27] best for a world of lost
[56:30] Sinners who are
[56:32] slain why was he slain for you and me he
[56:37] wasn't slain for
[56:39] himself he didn't come down here
[56:43] thinking about
[56:45] himself he gave
[56:47] himself for me and you he gave himself
[56:52] so that he can
[56:53] establish
[56:55] Legacy which
[56:57] Rel for all the next
[57:02] Generations it won't be only one
[57:05] generation it will be one generation and
[57:08] another generation and another
[57:10] generation another
[57:11] generation which would be
[57:15] beneficiary of that
[57:18] Legacy don't joke with the legacy of the
[57:23] cross want to say I am a
[57:27] beneficiary he became me that I might
[57:31] become him we are
[57:34] beneficiaries we are more than
[57:38] beneficiaries listen we are
[57:41] trophies we are
[57:45] trophies we are TR trophies that prove
[57:48] his
[57:51] victory you know when you run in the
[57:53] race
[57:57] when you win you get a
[58:00] trophy to prove your
[58:02] Victory are you
[58:04] following when Men of War went to
[58:07] fight they don't just come back
[58:11] empty-handed they come back with swords
[58:14] and
[58:16] Spears and sometimes they even came with
[58:20] heads of their slain
[58:23] enemies in order to prove that they were
[58:28] victorious these were
[58:34] Trophies the things which they
[58:36] brought were were
[58:38] trophies one time you
[58:41] know David went to fight his
[58:46] enemies and uh the you know the king
[58:49] said whoever will kill so many uh
[58:53] Philistines
[58:55] I will give him my
[58:58] daughter and so when David went he
[59:01] killed them he didn't just come back
[59:06] empty-handed he says I've done it he had
[59:09] to have something to show for
[59:11] it you know what that what that
[59:14] was it was the
[59:16] head of
[59:18] thees he had put it in the
[59:21] back so he just open and they had to
[59:25] them make sure it was the right
[59:27] number and that's how he married
[59:32] daughter let me tell you when Jesus
[59:35] Christ suffered and died on the
[59:39] cross what is the
[59:43] prophet what does he have to show for
[59:46] it to show his
[59:49] victory it is not his
[59:51] wounds no it is is not the
[59:56] cross many people you know especially
[59:59] Catholics and other religions they
[1:00:02] treasure these
[1:00:05] relics oh the cross oh this all that you
[1:00:09] know this the cross of Jesus oh no those
[1:00:13] are not the trophies of this
[1:00:16] Victory guess who are the
[1:00:19] trophies we are the trophies you are the
[1:00:22] trophies we are the trophies his
[1:00:26] victory we TR of his
[1:00:29] grace so why because he did it for
[1:00:34] me he did it for you not for
[1:00:40] himself he was a man of
[1:00:43] vision why did he come down to us he was
[1:00:47] a man of vision he was seeing a vision
[1:00:51] when they persecuting him he was seeing
[1:00:54] a vision
[1:00:55] when they killed him he was seeing a
[1:00:57] vision a vision of his church a vision
[1:01:01] of the
[1:01:03] generations after him will be
[1:01:07] beneficiaries of the
[1:01:11] Legacy
[1:01:13] beneficiaries of the
[1:01:15] Legacy that he has left
[1:01:19] behind
[1:01:21] beneficiaries of sure
[1:01:23] Legacy
[1:01:26] a legacy that cannot pass
[1:01:30] away but stands
[1:01:34] sure how many have ever inherited
[1:01:36] something from their
[1:01:40] parents yes a
[1:01:43] few brothers and sisters who have raised
[1:01:45] up your
[1:01:47] hand you have a legacy which
[1:01:50] inherited which you can to pass to your
[1:01:53] next generation
[1:01:55] the Next Generation after
[1:01:59] that but not to disappoint you let me
[1:02:03] say
[1:02:07] that's it pass
[1:02:09] away if it is a house it will grow old
[1:02:14] if it's land it can pass
[1:02:18] away if it is uh

[1:18:58] ministry young
[1:19:05] ministers praise
[1:19:07] God PA beaut his
[1:19:09] message on the basis of what was
[1:19:11] preached before
[1:19:13] him she was a
[1:19:16] beneficiary
[1:19:20] Legacy Act 19:5
[1:19:23] and when they heard
[1:19:25] this they were they were baptized in the
[1:19:27] name of the Lord
[1:19:29] Jesus and when Paul had laid up his
[1:19:32] hands upon
[1:19:33] them the Holy Ghost came on them and
[1:19:36] they SP with Tong and they
[1:19:39] prophesy and all men were about

[1:19:55] Paul was not there he was not
[1:19:58] there he wasn't there when the the first
[1:20:02] Believers Paul came in
[1:20:05] later but he's saying the same
[1:20:08] thing where did he get it from he got it
[1:20:11] from
[1:20:12] gods that had already been
[1:20:15] preaching did it undermine PA's
[1:20:20] position in the body no Paul was an
[1:20:24] apostle to the
[1:20:27] Gentiles but even then there was Peter
[1:20:31] there were others that had been the
[1:20:34] initial beneficiary of this
[1:20:38] Legacy but Paul was also within the
[1:20:41] promise as long as you are a beneficiary
[1:20:44] of
[1:20:45] that we are going to see the same
[1:20:49] thing the same life the same power
[1:20:53] The Same Spirit listen the same
[1:20:58] character it will be the same it will
[1:21:01] not be different the way God works with

[1:21:32] another it's the
[1:21:34] same same Spirit same character same
[1:21:38] power same

[1:21:47] important he says that's the way the
[1:21:49] church
[1:21:50] is and this will be the only what I'll
[1:21:53] give you and then the rest I'll just
[1:21:53] give you a few scriptures

[1:29:19] it it is in
[1:29:20] Scripture praise God and we we have
[1:29:25] received now the same original word
[1:29:29] which they received and this same word
[1:29:33] entitles you to receive the same thing
[1:29:36] they
[1:29:39] reive he said what did it do it it will

[1:30:00] experience praise God they only run
[1:30:03] after signs and and you know
[1:30:05] em wers and everything but when you
[1:30:09] watch their life their life is not of
[1:30:12] the original
[1:30:13] V that shows you what they have is the
[1:30:16] fake
[1:30:17] one where is the
[1:30:20] original the original is

[1:30:27] Ministry the message
[1:30:30] of we have the
[1:30:32] original we have the full word of God
[1:30:35] preaching his right way that we must
[1:30:39] also have the same power that will heal
[1:30:43] the
[1:30:44] sick the same power that will speak in
[1:30:47] Tong the same power that will change a
[1:30:53] into
[1:30:56] a when in ethopia they brought me a man
[1:30:58] who was half
[1:31:00] dead he was having
[1:31:04] TP long story
[1:31:06] short we simply prayed and God raised
[1:31:10] him
[1:31:13] up and what happened they invited us to
[1:31:17] go to the
[1:31:18] Village there is no Road there so we
[1:31:22] used the we we walked and then when we
[1:31:24] come when we coming back we came on back
[1:31:25] on horse back my first
[1:31:27] time we used
[1:31:29] horses and when
[1:31:31] we reached
[1:31:34] there the
[1:31:36] whole they say we want to
[1:31:40] see
[1:31:45] the we want to see the god of the second
[1:31:50] Lazarus
[1:31:52] and the brothers thean
[1:31:55] Brothers told
[1:31:57] me us let
[1:32:00] us do a Divine Healing
[1:32:03] service and preach about
[1:32:07] healing I told them God did not send me
[1:32:11] to make Divine Healing
[1:32:15] campaigns but he gave me the
[1:32:17] word I'm going to preach
[1:32:19] salvation and I'm going to preach
[1:32:21] baptism the name of our Lord Jes Christ
[1:32:23] I'm going to preach we have a
[1:32:24] message that same
[1:32:27] God who healed the brother will
[1:32:30] vindicate
[1:32:32] himself and the brothers were very sad
[1:32:36] said pastor you're ruing the
[1:32:39] moment we have to show them the power I
[1:32:43] said no God will show
[1:32:45] himself they will believe they will not
[1:32:47] believe I said will believe whoever
[1:32:51] predes
[1:32:52] at to life when they hear the word it
[1:32:56] will Quicken them it is not up to me to
[1:33:01] do the things it is up to him to
[1:33:03] demonstrate
[1:33:05] himself and we preach
[1:33:08] salvation of the
[1:33:12] soul and we pray for the
[1:33:16] sick Brothers we very
[1:33:18] sad when we asked have believed no one
[1:33:23] raised up their
[1:33:27] hand but they that trust in the name of
[1:33:29] the Lord shall not be
[1:33:34] ashamed you know what happened
[1:33:36] afterwards I'll tell you what happen it
[1:33:39] is very difficult there for people to
[1:33:42] believe
[1:33:43] public I learned later because when you
[1:33:47] believe no one will B
[1:33:50] you church that bu is there so if you
[1:33:54] believe something else who will bu
[1:33:58] you so nobody could come out but when we
[1:34:01] went back to the city one by one started
[1:34:05] coming until today there still coming I
[1:34:09] told the pastor there I said pastoras
[1:34:12] you will soon realize that you have the
[1:34:15] whole village and the whole village will
[1:34:18] realize they all
[1:34:20] believers
[1:34:24] before this one is
[1:34:26] baptized the other one does not know
[1:34:29] whoever gets baptized they keep quiet
[1:34:32] they keep quiet they keep quiet but they
[1:34:34] don't know that more than half of them
[1:34:36] are all baptized
[1:34:40] now you know when the word
[1:34:43] comes into a true pred
[1:34:46] SE begins eating you up slowly by slowly
[1:34:51] Slowly by slowly it is a sure word of
[1:34:58] Prophecy I am what I am because of this
[1:35:02] message this message can change you can
[1:35:07] even change your
[1:35:08] appetite can even change your
[1:35:11] desire can even change your
[1:35:18] reasoning I am so happy I
[1:35:50] brained
[1:36:20] those
[1:36:46] let me first finish this quar and then
[1:36:47] we go to Genesis CH
[1:36:50] 11
[1:36:54] how many are still with
[1:36:58] me
[1:36:59] listen why why should we have those
[1:37:03] things because it is thriving on the
[1:37:05] natural resources of the vine
[1:37:12] itself you see it wasn't grafted into
[1:37:15] the
[1:37:16] vine it was born in the
[1:37:19] vine when other branches were grafted
[1:37:25] in all they could do was Bear their own
[1:37:27] fruit for they were not born of that
[1:37:33] vine they don't
[1:37:35] know about the original life and
[1:37:37] original
[1:37:40] Fruit they cannot know for they were not
[1:37:42] born of
[1:37:44] it but if they had been born of
[1:37:48] it that same life that was in the
[1:37:50] original stem Jesus would have come
[1:37:52] through
[1:37:56] them and manifested through
[1:37:59] them he said I very I unto you he that
[1:38:04] believeth on me the works that I
[1:38:08] do he shall do also and great works than
[1:38:12] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:38:16] father denominations which are man
[1:38:20] directed
[1:38:25] cannot be born again born of
[1:38:27] God for it is the
[1:38:29] spirit not man that gives
[1:38:34] life praise God there quite much I can
[1:38:37] say about that let's let's move on
[1:38:39] because of
[1:38:40] time Genesis
[1:38:44] 11 you know the story but let's just
[1:38:46] read uh one one verse
[1:38:50] only and Tera took Abraham his son and L
[1:38:54] the son of Haron his son his son and
[1:38:56] Sarai his daughter-in-law his son
[1:38:59] Abraham's wife and they went forth with
[1:39:01] them from h of the ches to go into the
[1:39:04] land of Canaan and they came unto Haron
[1:39:07] andw
[1:39:10] there Genesis
[1:39:20] 11
[1:39:42] now let me invite you to something else
[1:39:47] here I want you to look at
[1:39:50] teror and what I will call the
[1:39:53] denominational
[1:39:59] Legacy
[1:40:01] teror having no
[1:40:04] promise having no
[1:40:07] Confidant having no Legacy from
[1:40:11] God whatsoever that he had
[1:40:14] inherited
[1:40:17] nothing he stands
[1:40:19] up I do not know either by
[1:40:25] instinct or by
[1:40:29] inspiration
[1:40:34] started do you know that all the
[1:40:38] denominations are claiming to be taking
[1:40:41] the people to
[1:40:44] Heaven they are trying to enter the
[1:40:46] promised
[1:40:49] land without without
[1:40:54] right and that's what ter was trying to
[1:40:58] do to his son
[1:41:01] ABR he was trying to take him to
[1:41:04] Canan but I want to say this the best
[1:41:07] Legacy that he could leave for his
[1:41:11] son was
[1:41:14] Haram
[1:41:16] har Haron was a mountaineous
[1:41:19] place
[1:41:21] Haron was a m was not a pleasant
[1:41:26] place you know they set out to go to
[1:41:30] Canan and for some reason they arrived
[1:41:34] in har and they could not
[1:41:36] proceed there is no
[1:41:39] way the denominational
[1:41:42] Legacy take people into the right pris
[1:41:48] land way promis land of the Holy
[1:41:53] Ghost is only going to be
[1:41:55] attained by the beneficiaries of this
[1:41:58] true and sure
[1:42:02] Legacy praise
[1:42:05] God in this place Terra dies so this is
[1:42:10] a place that is unpleased and filled
[1:42:14] with
[1:42:16] death and brother B also mentions on
[1:42:19] that when he he types
[1:42:23] Church to two places the
[1:42:28] Mery and to uh to the
[1:42:34] labor and it says what have they done
[1:42:36] the
[1:42:38] denominations they've turned
[1:42:40] Church into
[1:42:42] aary where even our young
[1:42:45] people will lose their
[1:42:48] enthusiasm will lose their fire
[1:42:51] we lose their
[1:42:54] SE and we want to deceive our
[1:42:58] elders to

[2:07:34] him and Isaac his son and cl the wood
[2:07:38] and cve the wood for the burn offering
[2:07:40] and Rose up and went up into the place
[2:07:41] of which God had told
[2:07:47] him
[2:07:50] then on on the third day Abraham lifted
[2:07:53] up his eyes and saw the place a far off
[2:07:55] and Abraham said unto his young man
[2:07:57] abide here with us and I and the Lord
[2:08:00] will go Yonder and worship and come
[2:08:02] again to
[2:08:13] you and Abraham took the wood of the B
[2:08:16] offering and laid it upon Isaac's son
[2:08:18] and and he took the fire in his hand and
[2:08:20] a knife and they went both of them
[2:08:21] together and Isaac spake unto Abraham
[2:08:23] his father and said my father he said
[2:08:26] here am I my son and he said behold the
[2:08:29] fire and the wood but where is the Lamb
[2:08:32] for a bur offering and Abraham said my
[2:08:34] son God will provide himself a lamb for
[2:08:36] a burn offering so they went both of
[2:08:38] them together and Abraham stretched
[2:08:41] forth this is verse 10 now and Abraham
[2:08:43] stretched forth his hand and took the
[2:08:45] knife to slay his son and the angel of
[2:08:47] the Lord called unto him out of heaven
[2:08:48] and said Abraham Abraham and he said
[2:08:51] here am I and he said lay not thine hand
[2:08:53] upon the Lord neither do do thou
[2:08:55] anything unto him for now I know that
[2:08:57] thou fearest God see that thou Hast not
[2:08:59] withheld thy son thy only son from you
[2:09:02] now I know must know this
[2:09:05] story so now listen church I've just
[2:09:08] been reading the
[2:09:10] story where Abraham had G to kill his
[2:09:14] son God told him go to where I will tell
[2:09:17] you
[2:09:19] and you will kill him
[2:09:21] there I'm now trying to come to a climax
[2:09:24] of my
[2:09:26] sermon praise God this message checks us
[2:09:30] child trains
[2:09:33] us trains
[2:09:35] us to what God wants us to
[2:09:38] do God is wise he's not going to leave
[2:09:41] the message with people who are not
[2:09:45] trained that's why younger ministers
[2:09:47] like us
[2:09:50] should not begin
[2:09:52] preaching unless we know what we talking
[2:09:54] about I give is not
[2:09:57] enough you need to be under a Ministry
[2:10:01] you need to be told you need to know
[2:10:03] what you're talking
[2:10:04] about that's why even me as a pastor I'm
[2:10:08] still
[2:10:09] mented by
[2:10:11] Elders why because I'm younger in the
[2:10:15] ministry you see now we see here
[2:10:19] this man Abraham begins to child train
[2:10:22] his son
[2:10:23] Isaac they went on up to the hill and as
[2:10:27] they were climbing I always love this
[2:10:30] part you know there is a place let me

[2:11:04] but when he reached
[2:11:05] somewhere brother bam as he's going to
[2:11:09] go into the thir
[2:11:11] pool of his
[2:11:13] ministry the others automatically had to

[2:16:54] there as rose up
[2:16:56] again out of that
[2:16:59] place Isaac left that
[2:17:02] place after being child
[2:17:05] train Abraham teaches
[2:17:08] Isaac and trains him the way of God now
[2:17:11] I'm reaching the clima here now he
[2:17:14] trains him to have faith in God
[2:17:18] Abraham's
[2:17:19] Ministry is very important to
[2:17:23] Isaac the B
[2:17:25] alone is not
[2:17:27] enough Isaac had to be child trained by
[2:17:29] Isa Abraham for to walk into the being
[2:17:33] the
[2:17:37] beneficiary to come to
[2:17:41] the of Abraham's great
[2:17:45] legacy it is important now
[2:17:48] for Isaac to both
[2:17:52] recognize and
[2:17:54] respect
[2:17:57] Abraham it is through
[2:17:59] those that have run before
[2:18:03] us that we become
[2:18:07] benici to honor
[2:18:09] them is not a privilege on their
[2:18:16] part
[2:18:25] honor them is not a privilege on their
[2:18:30] part it is a privilege on our
[2:18:36] part oh because I told
[2:18:38] you oh now that I have five
[2:18:41] children and I'm a pastor in Campa I was
[2:18:44] a pastor in Ethiopia oh Ethiopia has
[2:18:47] many Believers now so I'm now a big
[2:18:50] man and now I'm going to tell
[2:18:53] you you know even now
[2:18:57] I'm I be a fo to do
[2:19:02] that many
[2:19:16] min
[2:19:19] I'm now bigger than Pastor
[2:19:24] James my
[2:19:28] is I just met him
[2:19:31] recently whenever things come up I go
[2:19:33] and sit
[2:19:36] down why no man can replace
[2:19:42] your are you
[2:19:45] hearing Sten I kind of fill my heart
[2:19:49] that our
[2:19:51] generation needs to Lear
[2:19:56] this know that God has a great future
[2:19:59] for
[2:19:59] us a great work ahead of
[2:20:10] us on the
[2:20:13] right to honor the men of God the elders
[2:20:20] those who went before
[2:20:21] us is a privilege to
[2:20:25] us to recognize and respect
[2:20:28] them is not an
[2:20:34] option many young preachers come
[2:20:37] up happy to say this because I'm a
[2:20:39] younger
[2:20:41] preacher and all because they can shout
[2:20:44] and
[2:20:46] dance bigger preacher

[2:20:51] everybody that is
[2:20:54] PR Isaac needed to come to that
[2:20:58] place of realizing recognizing and
[2:21:01] respecting the
[2:21:04] Elder not an
[2:21:08] option it is a necessity for
[2:21:11] us to
[2:21:13] walk into this

[2:21:18] beneficiaries
[2:21:22] ofy that they have passed down to

[2:21:47] counted worthy of double honor
[2:21:48] especially they who labor in the word
[2:21:50] and

[2:24:12] working against Elders against deons we
[2:24:15] are to be ashamed of us

[2:36:18] exploits and they will never tell you
[2:36:20] where they came
[2:36:25] from is this going
[2:36:30] home I believe it has
[2:36:32] going now let me just read a few here
[2:36:38] and from
[2:36:40] Mage
[2:36:44] 9 but but job knew he wasn't a sinner
[2:36:46] because he was standing on the
[2:36:50] word god required that that b offering a
[2:36:53] confession and job had made his
[2:36:57] confession and stood on the word and he
[2:37:00] cried in the midst of his
[2:37:03] trouble I know my
[2:37:06] redeemer at the last day he will stand
[2:37:08] out of his
[2:37:10] trouble I know my redeemer
[2:37:12] Liv at the last days he will stand on
[2:37:15] the Earth
[2:37:17] and though the skin worm destroy in this
[2:37:21] body yet in my flesh shall I
[2:37:24] see his comfort was God his promise God
[2:37:27] his
[2:37:30] word and the prophet says that is theit
[2:37:36] that we
[2:37:37] have God is what it is the
[2:37:41] promise God gave Abraham the
[2:37:44] promise Abraham pass it to
[2:37:47] Isaac pass to
[2:37:49] Jacob down to us
[2:37:51] today in our generation God gave the
[2:37:54] word to our
[2:37:56] prophet and our elders received
[2:37:59] it they were stewards of
[2:38:02] it they passed it down to this
[2:38:05] generation let me tell you most of our
[2:38:07] elders that started
[2:38:09] out are growing old and old and
[2:38:13] old but they have done a nor work
[2:38:18] we started
[2:38:19] translation in
[2:38:21] luganda and uh P St you may not know
[2:38:25] this but some brothers told them said
[2:38:28] well now that we have our own team of
[2:38:30] doing Uganda
[2:38:33] translations we have to remove
[2:38:35] everything the others
[2:38:37] did because it was not good and then we
[2:38:40] start something good
[2:38:43] freshh I told them I don't see that
[2:38:45] anywhere in the
[2:38:49] scripture if we are going to do
[2:38:52] translation we are starting on top of
[2:38:55] what others
[2:38:57] did because what they did was the best
[2:39:00] they could
[2:39:01] do and what they did has got us
[2:39:05] here from there we continue
[2:39:08] building the work of God is not a
[2:39:14] war
[2:39:16] building is a building and we are
[2:39:19] building this
[2:39:20] work we are fellow laborers
[2:39:24] together but we are not going to build a
[2:39:27] house by destroying the
[2:39:30] foundation we are building on top of the
[2:39:33] foundation that has been laid for
[2:39:36] us thank God for Uganda for the message
[2:39:41] coming in this country thank God for me
[2:39:44] like brother Steven
[2:39:46] thank God for
[2:39:49] like God for other men that
[2:39:52] Ed every region in this
[2:39:55] country what was that it was God laying
[2:39:59] a
[2:40:00] foundation for Our
[2:40:03] Generation what have we received we have
[2:40:06] received this
[2:40:07] message we must receive it with a seal
[2:40:11] with fire we must receive it with vision
[2:40:16] we must be ready oh I'm bing up with
[2:40:20] this we must be ready to take it out
[2:40:24] with the same Zeal the same passion the
[2:40:28] same fire the same
[2:40:30] burden the way they
[2:40:34] have and then watch
[2:40:39] what I'm telling you what I don't
[2:40:42] believe the Rapture is very
[2:40:43] far but if the Rapture is C
[2:40:47] must find us on fire for
[2:40:51] God we hear many
[2:40:53] testimonies of what God used them to
[2:40:56] do but we want to see that in our
[2:41:01] generation men and women who were
[2:41:05] praying how you you you ask Mama where
[2:41:09] is
[2:41:11] she she oh right over there just find
[2:41:15] time and talk with

[2:41:19] to pray how they they used to T for God
[2:41:23] H for
