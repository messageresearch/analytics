And when I was leaving told me George, anytime you feel like coming to Uganda, just let me know. So we've been communicating many times. I look at his sermon sometime on Facebook YouTube.

I said, "Pastor, it's just wrinkling me to come cuz it's very difficult for me to travel most times these days because I also pastor. I'm also a pastor." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. One of my son is standing my church this morning to minister to the people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So three places were in my heart. There are three places I will have my heart to travel to. One of the place was a place in Nigeria. I've not been there before. So I just called the pastor. I say it's laid upon my heart to come to greet your people. Then he said that's all right. Say come say I should come. Then the second place was Uganda here and I also come as a ballet. I said I would like to come and the third place was Canada. So by the grace of God I have covered Nigeria part and I'm here in Uganda now and the other one is in Canada. I have also called them over there. So they are making preparation for me to come. So when I was in in the place I went to Nigeria there was a wonderful thing that happened. I have never had that experience in my life before. But it was wonderful. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was wonderful. A wonderful experience. So this time now I'm in Uganda.

He's mindful of you. Therefore, when we come to the house of God like this, I always tell us, let us give undivided attention. Let us not be divided. Let us not be distracted. Don't be walking up and down. It could be a day of your visitation. Concentrate because we in his presence and in God's presence demand reverence. reverence and that's why as his presence is here this morning when you recognize the presence of God he will release to you your heart and you can't be recognizing God presence by being irreverent way to show that you recognize God's presence you will be reverence. And when God seeing you that you are reverence for his presence, you can never go back the same, he release a blessing to you. And I believe this morning, God release a blessing to you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are God's children. And we are privileged in times like this for God to reveal to us our position in him is a privilege because we are living in time of confusion. The world is confused. The people are confused. It's a prophecy that in the end times are to be failing for fear. But he has told you and me not for my presence is with you to bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be God. &gt;&gt; So, Pastor James, thank you very much again. God bless you. So, he was telling me has told me before that we are going to have a prayer line. The other time I was here, I minister in this pulpit. When I finished preaching, the moment I finished preaching, &gt;&gt; I called the pastor. &gt;&gt; I hand over to him. I ran away. I ran to the office. &gt;&gt; I remember. &gt;&gt; So when I ran to the office, &gt;&gt; he came to meet me in the office. People are in the go and pray for them. [Laughter] Pastor Steve, he came to he came to he said come. He said you are finished preaching. He said they at the altar come. Then I came. Then I started praying for them one after the other. When I finished praying for the people, I was very tired. I think it was because of that tiredness, I ran away to the hospital. I was trying to help myself. The pastor went to go and bring me back. So when I finished praying, I become more tired and I was to travel to back to Kala. to be with a a church there. So there was a brother here. &gt;&gt; I remember that and I I I lay hand upon him. I prayed for him. So when I was taken back to campala then they they they directed me to the hotel where I was to stay. Then when I was packing my things, I saw the was following me. He was packing the things. Then after we enter, I enter my guest room. I said, "Brother, thank you. I appreciate you." He said, he said, "Thank you, sir. I I appreciate you more." I said, "More." He said, "I follow you down from ginger. I was in the church when you were ministering. I was among the people that you lay hand upon. This is the Bible before me. I'm giving his testimony." He said I was having some medical conditions that I've been battling. He said to even make you sure I am a medical practitioner is my line and the bounties have no use when you lay hand on me that let me follow you. to this place. &gt;&gt; I want to see attend the meetings. I want to see &gt;&gt; I want to see attend your meetings. [Music] I said I said brother congratulation. We thank God for that. I don't know is the brother here this morning. He told me he was not a member of this boat. He was in that meetings. the condition left him since it's that time. He has not experienced it. Our God is here to heal. Our God is here to deliver. Our God is here to bless. Our God is here to lift up. And I believe this morning today is somebody's day of visitation. Because that's the purpose of the word is to give you something I believe this morning. God will give us something. So again I bring greetings from Nigeria from my family from the church. Glory be to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this morning by the grace of God I want to read from the book of Ephesians. Ephesians chapter 3. Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14. to 20. Father, we are told the pace of this Bible, but it takes you to give the understanding. We are depending upon you for understanding. We depend upon you for revelation. Lord, may you grant it to us and give us a blessing in Jesus Christ. Ephesians 3:14 to 20. For this cause I bow my kneel unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. that he will grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man. may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye be rooted and grounded in love. &gt;&gt; May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height. and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge and that you might be filled with all the fullness of God. Now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that workketh in us. May the Lord bless his word in Jesus Christ's name as we have our seat &gt;&gt; this morning by the grace of God from that place we read in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14 down to 20 I want to take a test from the last verse and t to it the power that walketh in us. &gt;&gt; The power that walketh in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This morning by the grace of God, &gt;&gt; I'm going to use Jacob to be a case reference. Because in the book of second Peter chapter 2 verse 11 he was telling us about angels &gt;&gt; which are greater in power and mind. Angels are greater in power and in might. So that verse is telling us about the power of angels. Angels have power because this want to talk about power. The power that workketh in us. So because we want to talk about power, I want to go I want to go to before the beginning when there was no God when the attribute god was not yet manifested. So we want to talk about the great antenna Elohim. Elohim, the selfexisting one before he was God, there's an attribute he have in him as the eternal spirit that he want to manifest. The creator of heaven and earth, the great internal spirit that filled the all There was nothing like heaven. There was nothing like earth because heaven was his attribute. X was his attribute. You and me were his attribute. So everything was just an attribute in him and he was existing alone with his attribute. He was not yet God. Do you should give me who is this paragraph 57 55 &gt;&gt; who is this mech paragraph 55 it was not yet evil God. It was not yet evil anything but just the spirit entire spirit and it filled the entire place and we were attribute in him existing within alone but there are things he wants to manifest. Redemption was his manifestation. He was a redeemer but as being a redeemer The de was an attribute in him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he wants to be manifesting this attribute. But before that start the first thing he did, he made a body. He made a body because he's the maker of all things both in heaven and on earth. So the first thing that he did he made a body and when he made a body the entire spirit he now can into the body he can know he poured himself into that body and that body is what we call the word that is why John chapter one said in the beginning was the The word have a beginning. The internal does not have a beginning. &gt;&gt; Get it right. &gt;&gt; The internal spirit does not have a beginning but the word have a beginning. What we call the word is a body that the entire spirit pou then he said in the beginning was the word have you are you there so that was the stage he was when he started creating And the first thing he created &gt;&gt; they were angels. So when that made angel angels responsibility their funure their function their operations their work was to worship. And when started worshiping the attribute of God was now manifested, he become God. That's what we become God. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It become God because angel were there to worship. Among all these angels there were categories because God is a god of variety. Is a god of variety on earth. Is a god of variety in heaven. In heaven there are categories of angels. We have the we have the major angels. We have no categories of angels. He made them stay in their position worship and among all the angels that God created. &gt;&gt; Lucifer Lucifer &gt;&gt; was the second command. It was the second command because even God himself in the heavenly creation in the heavenly creation is an angel. [Applause] [Music] Christ. Hebrew chapter one told us that angel his fellows [Applause] say thy scepter is the scepter of righteousness. &gt;&gt; Thy scepter is the scepter of righteousness. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you call scepter here. Scepter &gt;&gt; scepter &gt;&gt; something of a king. So the king holds [Applause] thy s is the scepter of righteousness. Thou hated iniquity and love righteousness that that was that was anointed with oil of gladness. That was anointed with oil of gladness. Okay. The gladness above thy fellows. So he was a fellow to the angels. It was Michael in angelic form. Micah and Lucifer they were coequal in everything except in creation. They were coequal in everything except in creation was the one that created Lucifer and he created all things. Among all the angel he came Lucifer Lucifer &gt;&gt; was the only angel that have a throne. He have a throne. Mikey have a throne. Lucifer have a truth. And Lucifer was created to be the one to leave the worship. He was the anointed cher and leave the worship. He was to worship. He was to lead the other angel to worship. That was his work. He was the most beautiful among all the angels. He was the song leader. All instrument of music were in him. He was made like that. He was the most beautiful among God the angels and he was made like that. The book of Ezekiel chapter 28 tells us that. He was anointed. &gt;&gt; So when he called for worship, it was a wonderful worship because he was an anointed worship. When it's time to worship, the entire heaven will be shaken and he was doing it wonderfully until the beauty all the come over his head. He got lifted up with pride &gt;&gt; and he now wants also to be worshiped. These things I want to not touch every one point. Whatever God has given to you, God don't want the to. &gt;&gt; Whatever God has given to you, don't let it come over your head. Don't let it. Humble yourself. God is looking for people that he will give something to a human being that God will give something to and he want to see remain a woman being. The more you humble yourself, the more God will bless you because God love humility. God he live, &gt;&gt; walk and dwell in humility. That is why when you see people and they say they have seen God evidence to know that a man has seen God when you see men who carry their chest up seen God anything you have anything I have give it to us because the Bible say there is Nothing the man can receive except God give it from him. So when God give you something, humble yourself with it. He will give you the more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is what God wants because that is God's nature. God's nature is humility. &gt;&gt; Humility. So because of the way Lucifer was made, pride came over him. &gt;&gt; Then he said, &gt;&gt; I will also exalt my throne. Isaiah 12 verse 14:2. I will now exalt my throne above the stars of God. I want to be worshiped also. It was because of the way what was given to him. This thing were written for our learning. &gt;&gt; For our learning so get this clear. Whatever you receive, it is from God. And God want you to humble yourself because there's no limit blessing you can humble yourself. &gt;&gt; What am I saying? He get lifted up. He wants to be worshiped. Then he went because of his intentions, his desire. He went to the angels. Then he preached to them. [Music] &gt;&gt; He preached to them. I see the way this is now. &gt;&gt; I think we can better kingdom. I give better position responsibility. I have better things. He succeeded. He will turn of he succeeded. &gt;&gt; He succeeded. to war to of the angels. He succeeded to war to third of the angel to himself. And the Bible says there was war in heaven because sin has started. Heaven has been divided and might ascend. It can't contain us. Either you come repent or you go down. So there was war because there's no repentance for angels. When they fall, they fall. No repentance for angels. When they fall, they fall. So there was war. It was not easy war. Now listen this one coming. Lucifer in heaven when he succeeded in war the ages because they were stars of heaven stars of God. There is a difference between stars of heaven. When we talking about the stars of heaven in revelation 12, those were the one that were worshiping. When we talking about the stars of God, we talking about the sons of God. So when there was a war in heaven, Lucifide and others remain with God. And that is why you and me I believe this morning we are sitting down here because we are stars of God [Applause] because it takes a star of God to receive the word of God. &gt;&gt; He's not shooting. &gt;&gt; Are you shooting? I'm changing my mind. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Give me another one. I'm not there again. I'm not. Give me another one again. Unfailing reality. Unfailing reality. 22 224. Unfailing reality. 224. I'm not here again. I'm coming back. So what happened? &gt;&gt; He succeeded to divide the heaven. I want to show you something. This is why today as you are here sitting down in the presence of God to hear the voice of God in this last day, there are also people in church they are hearing the voice of the God of this evil age. So as the heaven was divided even the earth is also divided. There are people today with this same Bible, they in church and they in millions and in billions because from the beginning they f with Lucifer they are also in churches this morning believing God of this evil age. You and me you are sitting down here believe in the almighty God because we are in him. This is it. &gt;&gt; 224. Yes. 22 to4 24 2. &gt;&gt; I want to show you something that these things are not coincident. So as the angel fell, there were some angel that stayed with Mike. As some people fail, there are people that stay with Mike and the grace of God. We are the one that stay with Michael. That is why when Mike came down and become Jesus Christ, [Music] &gt;&gt; this system is really not giving more than once. If he cannot go, let's go on our own. I want to give I want to show you the informations. &gt;&gt; What am I saying? &gt;&gt; So there was war in heaven. Heaven was divided. &gt;&gt; Then he and his cohort, Lucifer and his cast down. When Lucifer and his cohort were cast down, they lost their estate. They lost their habitation. Because their estate was to be angels. Their habitation were heaven was heaven. So when they were cast down, they lost their habitation their become Satan. He was no longer Lucifer. He become Satan. And the angel that fell with him become demon. But get something clear. Get something clear. Even when they were cast down, they still having their power. Let me say one more thing. Greed does not satisfy a hungry heart. who satisfied. If a man is hungry for God, you can tell him. Say the creed. Apostle say the apostle cre join the church. Put your name on here. The spring or whatever you or whatever you want that will not satisfy a hungry soul. Because they were predestinated to of God to search. [Applause] They were predest. They were once the angel. They were once the angels. They were once an angel who did not fall to the angel of heaven. That is those evil spirits walking walking very religious okay walking among the people very religious you know the Bible says that you was just not always here you were somewhere else before we were in his thoughts so even when there was war in heaven We stay with him. &gt;&gt; We did not reel. &gt;&gt; We did not repel. &gt;&gt; We did not rebel. We protest. Here we go. Because we were predestinated for life. We are part of life. Life is our identity. We can't be satisfied. Nothing that is not life. So what am I saying? &gt;&gt; Lucifer Lucifer &gt;&gt; and his cohort when they were cast down &gt;&gt; they lose theiration. They lost their estate. It become Satan. The angels become demons and they were cast out from heaven. When they were cast on the earth, they lost their place and he was wandering up and down because a man that does not have a house wonders. That's why today he's a wonderer. I'm quoting scripture. The enemy is going up and down looking for to divor and his demons. &gt;&gt; But get something clear. Get something clear. &gt;&gt; God did not take the power from them. Only what they lost was their estate and their habitation. But their power was still with them was still with them. So when they came they were rigaro rig maro that is moving with their power looking for who to devour looking for what to devour and let me tell you something. When they were cast down from heaven, God see to it, God saw to it that he did not allow all the angel to be marrowing. He b some of them because of their fierceness in some quarters. Not every angel was ready to read. There were some that were banned in rebu. They were banned in rebu collapse. So they were banned. So we burn the chain of darkness in in the of the lost. You know when you b prisoner he can't lose himself. He want to go out [Applause] but he's blessed. So we burn fruit. &gt;&gt; So we burn in hell just like that. So we released &gt;&gt; I want to show you something because they still have their power and go lose them. If God lose them, they will not be hurt. &gt;&gt; So, some were released, &gt;&gt; some were released. &gt;&gt; And Satan, &gt;&gt; who is the Lucifer? &gt;&gt; The Bible says he was the prince of the power of the air. How did he become the priest of the power of the air? When he was cast down, &gt;&gt; he came to Eden. &gt;&gt; He met Adam. &gt;&gt; Adam was a god in Eden. &gt;&gt; Everything was under Adam because he was a son of God. A son of God have the power of God. A son of God. The power of God. He better than them because of Adam know who he is. He know his position. There is nothing Lucifer can do. He just tell him move. Leave here, leave here. He will leave. must respect him because there's something we should we should know in the spirit world. They follow order in the spirit realm there is in the spirit realm they follow order they don't follow no title does not work in spirit it is order that work in spirit What are you? Are you a son of God? Are you a daughter of God? That is what operate spirit train. Are you a demon? Are you light? Are you darkness? This is what work is spirit train does not work. Amen. I am pope. I am bishop. I am apostle. It doesn't work. Title only work in the name of the motors and title is as a result of falling falling falling fall. When God make us in the beginning men and women brothers and sisters daughters work [Applause] in the spirit realm. Pope does not work. &gt;&gt; Bishop does not work does not work. What work? Are you a son? Are you a daughter? Are you life? Are you [Applause] spirit does not they don't recognize title &gt;&gt; they recognize authority. So when a demon come now you say I'm coming to you as pope doesn't know demon doesn't know pope &gt;&gt; they want to know are you light are you darkness [Applause] this title we carried up and down I am senior apostle it doesn't work doesn't know what your They recognize authority. What is your authority? This is why in the book of Isaiah chapter 6, Isaiah was born a prophet. Not just a prophet. Isaiah was born a prophet. He was a major prophet. And he had been so influenced. He has been so influenced &gt;&gt; by Uzziah like Kingiah and when Uzziah &gt;&gt; misbehaved and God handle him. This is way God operate is no respect of anybody. God turned into a leper. That was I open. He ran to the temple. When to the temple as he was crying, God opened his eyes. He saw heaven. He saw God lifted up in his throne. They were in position worship. Holy, holy, holy. Holy was brought to the presence of the so when the were moving holy holy holy holy they could not look at God they use their way to cover their eyes he to cover their feet behind As they were moving, one of the one of them was hanging them. He said, "What are you doing?" I am a man of uncle people. are not qualified to stand a prophet. &gt;&gt; He could not fit in when he saw the presence of God. &gt;&gt; The title does not work in God's presence. He could not open his mouth say I am a prophet. Prophet for what? It is holiness. [Applause] He screamed &gt;&gt; I am a sinner. &gt;&gt; I am not qualified. That is who everybody is in the presence of God. Nothing like pope. Nothing like arbishop. Nothing like anything. Either you are a son or a daughter or you out. So when you see men today with title, &gt;&gt; they laden, they put title on their motors. &gt;&gt; Those are motors. Motor mean flesh. Flesh that don't understand heavenly precept. This is why this is why the prophet taught me you if you love me call me brother because in the presence of the heavenlies in the presence of the heavenlies in the region of the spirit a sister, a son, a daughter. [Applause] This is the prophet was teaching us heavily heavenly chronology, evil terminologies. Call me brotherh [Music] sinner. Either you a sister &gt;&gt; or a sinner and a sinner cannot call to God's presence because God is holy. This is why we don't just call anybody brother before you become a brother in this church. If you are coming the first time we can't just call you brother because it take qualification to become a brother. Before you can be called a brother, you must believe what you believe. You must believe what you believe. You must repent. You must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. You must become a brother. When you are not going through that process, you are not yet a brother. you a visitor. You may be coming every day. You have not go through this process. You are a visitor. You are not yet a brother. There are things that qualify you to be a brother. Assembly. You must have heard the gospel because the commission given to us, go into the world and preach God. If the believer baptized is a brother, if you are not yet baptized, he's not a brother. You are not a brother. Because there are things that indop you into the fellowship of this church in ministries. The thing that he do you as a brother is water baptism in Jesus Christ name you become a brother here. Now listen even when you are a brother here you are not qualified to vote. Except except after you have been baptized you are not coming every time you will support this church with your tithe with your offering and you are not qualified. If you are a brother and you are not coming every time and you are not paying your tithe and your offering this church to support the cause. When they want to vote when you vote, when they are voting, it's a vote of ringing. It's a vote of ringing the election because you are not qualified. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's a boat of rigging. He's a dubious boat. &gt;&gt; No, no, the kingdom of God. The election was not free and fair because of your vote. [Applause] And if you're a brotherh and if you're a brother &gt;&gt; and you are coming every time then you pay your offering. You pay your tithe, you are a brother, you are qualified now in the say so. In the same so you can be voted for. and you can vote. &gt;&gt; That still does not make you a brother of God. You are still not a brother in the kingdom of God. You only a brother in ministry because there are things that will disqualify you as a brother in the kingdom of God. And when you are not a brother in the kingdom of God, be be careful. &gt;&gt; You cannot cast out demon. &gt;&gt; All I know Jesus I know. Who are you? People will ask you who are you? [Applause] [Music] So there are things that will qualify you to be a brother. in the kingdom of God. And when you become a brother in the kingdom of God, you are embraced in heaven. Amen. Now listen. When you are now embraced in in heaven, Satan cannot touch you again because you are still away from the kingdom of this world. And it take a power to do that. It is the power. We talking about this morning. Power that is in us. Power that is in us. This what we are talking about this morning. So listen, if you have not received that power opportunity for you to receive it now to be a brother in the kingdom of God because the Bible say by one spirit, we are being baptized to the body of Christ. When you are into the body of Christ, you are a brother kingdom of God. You become a brother, &gt;&gt; then Satan cannot touch you again. &gt;&gt; Then you have been given power to cast out Satan. That says, "This sign shall follow those that believe in my name. They cast a demon. of demon is the respons of a brother and a sister. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in John chapter one John chapter one, he came to his own so receive not. But as many that receiveth him, he gave them power. [Applause] He gave them power. But because sons and daughters born by flesh by sex, they were not born by the church but they were born by God because the way our parents gave birth to us, they will become human being. God have to give birth to you to become a fellow in the house of God is a birth just as we have our father and our mother &gt;&gt; that meet together &gt;&gt; by their only union by their wedlock holy wedlock to bring us here. That is the same way for you to enter the kingdom of God. A father and a mother has to meet again for you to be born. Then you will ask me who is our mother in the kingdom of God is faith. Faith is our mother in the kingdom of God. God is our father in the kingdom of God. So faith in the word of God came there to you. Faith is our mother. And God is our father and God is the word. This is why faith cometh by hearing by the word. So when you hear the word of God and your faith join with it, you will be born. They become a candidate in the kingdom of God. And that's why when you are like that, when you are like that, Satan cannot get you &gt;&gt; because you have been sealed &gt;&gt; into the body of Christ. This is why Ephesians chapter 2:30 said, "Grieve not the Holy Ghost." Ephesians 4:30, grieve not the Holy Ghost of God by which you were sealed. into the kingdom. So he says you have been sealing and when you want to seal you here Satan out from you the only way Satan can get you the only way Satan can get you he must go through the same process you came through. He must hear the gospel. He must believe he must repent. He must be baptized. He must be filled with the spirit. And when it happen like that to him, he become a brother also. He will not be a satanic. &gt;&gt; It's a process. It's a process. It's a procedure. It's a procedure. A process &gt;&gt; you must go through. So don't just come and sit down here. Say, I am a believer of God. I'm going to rapture. I'm going to rapture. No. There are things that qualify you to be a candidate [Music] qualify you to be a candidate. Sitting down here does not qualify you. You have to pass through process. That's why you are here this morning. and you have not yet passed through this process. This is your due of visitation because we have been taught when rapture happen this beauty is not going rapture. This beauty this beauty this beauty is not going rapture. This is not going all the microphone will still be here. Our people will still be here. That's it. People they will still be here. They will be in church where has happened after that happen. They will still come to church. [Music] Now tell you tell yourself I am I'm not the person. Tell yourself I'm not that person. People will gather here. They will listen song. They will be waiting for the pastor to come and preach to them. But the real people of God has gone. &gt;&gt; Tell yourself, I will not be here. And we are going to see it. We are going to see it. How you will know if you will not be here. There is nothing be everything has been open. Are you there Mr. Shoot me? Who is this mech paragraph 42? Who is this mech? Let's go back to paragraph 42. Now let me show you something. This Bible has been like a sculptural work that has been covered up. Give me that be covered up. God promise in this last day he will open it. &gt;&gt; No, 44. 44 is okay. &gt;&gt; 42. &gt;&gt; 42. Where is it? &gt;&gt; 42. 42. Notice &gt;&gt; like the sculptor He hides with a mask over it. That is what God has done to this age. It has been he all this thing has been healed and is supposed to be revealed in this age. Yes. This you are hearing is the you are hearing now. Now the Bible says they will be revealed in the latter times. It's like a sculptor keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it. And there it is. And that is what the Bible has been. It has been a work of God that have been covered up and it has been hid the foundation of the world and the sevenfold mystery that God promised in this day at the age of the church. We will take the mask off of the whole thing and we proceed. So this is you are hearing the revelation have been given to us according to God's promise and we &gt;&gt; a little group of people. We are enjoying the revelation. We are enjoying the blessing. This you are hearing now. You can't hear it in denomination. Everywhere we scatter because the Bible says wherever the cak is the ego we gather and their ego this is our food &gt;&gt; and we are feasting on them we are feasting on our food &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; what I say &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; Satan &gt;&gt; stand &gt;&gt; it was moving up and with his demons &gt;&gt; and he came to the garden. &gt;&gt; He met Adam. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you will take it. &gt;&gt; Adam was the one that named Satan. &gt;&gt; Satan name Satan. Satan. &gt;&gt; The name Satan. Give Satan that name Satan. Okay. Adam [Applause] because of his behavior. He saw a creature just marrowing up and down. Adam look said you shall be called Satan. That's why tomorrow he said he was not named Satan in heaven. It was Lucifer in heaven. When he came to earth, it was the god of this earth that name is Satan. Then the angels that fell with them and then look at them called demons devils. That was not their name in heaven. So when they fell down from our habitation and they fell down to the earth, Adam was the god here. He named everything he name everything. So when you see these strange creatures you the way you are behaving you are demon you the way you are behaving you are satan. That's when we say demon. Demon is a tormentor. Anything that torment is demon. When you have a husband at home, if you are a wife that is tormenting you, is a demon. When you have a wife at home that is tormenting you, he's a demon. Demon demon to make their characteristics. So when they come our sickness they torment when they come anywhere they come they torment when they come here now they will cause confusion here but they can't do anything here we are in the presence of God we have been given authority cast them out [Applause] &gt;&gt; so when you see a sister Restless, &gt;&gt; restless sister, &gt;&gt; just restless. &gt;&gt; Not comfortable. &gt;&gt; Looking for confusion. Looking for trouble. There's a demon in that person. Is demon in that person because when this demon fell as I told you, so we binged over. Some were banned in chain of some were permitted to to wander up and down. Those that were permitted to wander up and down, they are not the spirit that give men nature. So when you see a man who is an adulterer, who is an adulterer, there's a demon of adultery in that man. Adulter is a demon. [Applause] Fornication is a demon. &gt;&gt; Fornication. &gt;&gt; Fornication is a demon. Loss is a demon. Stealing is a demon. Someone is a demon. They demon that give people nature. So when you because they are spirit they need a place to beat. So when they enter their flesh they gave them nature possess that demon is a demon that possess them push them to do what they do that push them to do what they do. He push them because every spirit that is in you have infl witchcraft. It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. So when he come into somebody possess the person the way the holy ghost possess us possess them he possess them to do evil this is why when you see a sinner does anything good is by mistake is by mistake Because the demon in there always wanted to be doing evil. It is the same thing when you see a Christian fil with the Holy Ghost does anything wrong, make a mistake because it's a demon that is in you control you. &gt;&gt; This is why by the grace of God is not difficult today. to know a man that had the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It's not difficult. &gt;&gt; It's not difficult except you don't know the scripture. If you know scripture, you will know how to identify spirit because spirit are identified by their characteristics. Yes, sir. They have characters. That's why the work of a man The character of a man is made known by his work. That's why Jesus Christ said, "By their fruit, you shall know them." And let me tell you one thing about demon. Let me tell you one thing about demon because they were angels. They were in heaven. They were worshiping before they were cast down. They are very religious. They are very religious and that is why except you know the scripture when a man stand by the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and a man is demon possessed you know the difference you are in the spirit of the Holy Ghost because spirit spirit spirit recognize spirit demon preach the gospel Demon are behind puppets. Let me come to puppet. Let me come to puppet. If you want to know a demon in the public, any man that stand behind a puppet and preach anything contrary to the word of God, any man that will stand behind a puppet &gt;&gt; and he will tell you what the Bible say does not mean that is demon. [Applause] any man they will stand behind a puppet. I try to explain the Bible, interpret the Bible, &gt;&gt; any man that stand behind the tried to change what the Bible has written, that is an enticing spirit. [Music] In a church when you see people gather and make carry the Bible and make carry the Bible, they come to church and that church &gt;&gt; teaches things that are contrary to the Bible. are demons practice things do things that are contrary to the Bible those are demon that's what the Bible warn you and me say in the last days they shall show great signs and wonders that if it were possible they will deceive the very men possessed with demon That is why you will ask me but they are doing miracles. They doing such are wonders. They are doing miracles. Wonder do miracles. &gt;&gt; Demon do miracles. They do signs and wonders. But how you catch them? Bring them to the wall. bring them to the wall. They can't stay with the wall because they did not stay with the word yesterday. Stay with the war today with Lucifer. &gt;&gt; They fell with Lucifer &gt;&gt; and they in her talking about power. Demons have power. Satan have power. Then God have power. And I want to tell you something. All the power that Michael was having, Lucifer also have it. &gt;&gt; The only difference, he cannot create. This is why because it was the angel that was given that authority because he cannot create. He can pervert. He can pervert what is created. A lie. A lie is a truth perverted. That's why in Genesis when he came to the woman, it was serpent that came to preach false to the woman. In Genesis 3, he came with the word. He met the woman. He said, "What did God say?" He was the one that went for evangelism. He went for evangelism. He was looking for disciples. Then he made the woman. He said, "What did God say?" The woman said, "God has said, we shall eat of all the trees that is in the garden, but the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the day we touch it, we shall die." He said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; you shall not surely die. For God know the day you eat your eyes will be open. You will be like God. Now listen now listen. The woman did not know. She was already a god. She didn't know because she was deceived. The woman she was a god but she didn't know. It is the same with you and me. We are god know. That is why the seven thunder will reveal &gt;&gt; the seven thunders. &gt;&gt; The seven will reveal the entire Bible that week it will be hidden for you and me. So this will be God to pick all his subjects from everywhere they are to everywhere for everywhere they are. He repeat these seas. Repeat all his subjects from everywhere they are. Repeat to them. The Bible, &gt;&gt; the Bible, &gt;&gt; Bible. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says, "They that know their God shall be strong." And that's why today we have know our God. We know that the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus Christ of the New Testament. That Jesus Christ is the name of God is God's name of redemption because redemption came with a name. That's why I told you baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit the name of the father of the son of the spirit is Jesus Christ. [Applause] Now we all know who our God is. Any time that God reveal to you who he is, the next thing God does, he reveal to you who you are because we are in him. We are part of him. We are born of his flesh of his flesh. And today he has revealed to you and me that we are the bread of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why we speak where the Bible speak and silent where the Bible silence we are subject to our husband in all ways. &gt;&gt; And because of that when he deceived the woman he perverted creation. &gt;&gt; He perverted the creation &gt;&gt; through that intercourse. Let me talk about intercourse a little bit. Sex is an animal way, not God's way. It's not that God didn't give us sex. Animal taught us sex. Animal taught us how to sex. We should open this secrets have a place to be manipulating people. God did not give us sex. When you see people in the world, they will say sex was a very good God. God did not give sex. Animal way, not God way. Because it's not God way. That's why no children cannot come from God in that way. [Applause] He had his way &gt;&gt; that he bring forth his children and the way of God is by the spoken word. [Applause] And that is why when we talk about sex, brother taught us, God permitted it because men choose it. The animal gave it to us, we choose it. Then God said, if that is the way you want to go, that's all right. That's why I told the woman it pays. It pays in sorrow. Will you give birth? &gt;&gt; It's animal way. So before you give birth, you will go through sorrow, you will go through pain because of that. &gt;&gt; Now listen and that is why even when God permits sex, he only permit it when a man is legally married. If you are not legally married, you don't have business with sex. The Bible calling fornication. He say flee fornication because every sin that a man committed is answer to the body. If I commit fornication against his own body. This is why today you will see women sometime they will give birth to children you don't even know the look look like you don't know the child look like one year &gt;&gt; we resemble somebody else that girl involved in fornication and when the man deposit &gt;&gt; oh brother let's go you laughing I'm in the spirit We don't laugh when we are in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you okay? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not a laughing matter, brother. &gt;&gt; This is a truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when that's why he told us &gt;&gt; a woman was given a seal to seal our private part. It's a seal. &gt;&gt; And that seal was given a pack. That pack is a ciple with blood. That blood was not to be broken except you are married. When a man marry a woman. Now listen and he made the woman. There is something that woman put on that man. [Applause] Put that mark on that man. cannot fit that mark. &gt;&gt; He can't fix it. Can't fix it. That is why God hate fornication. He said, "Flee flee. flee fornication because every sin that a man sit outside his body that committed fornication sin against his own body. And that is why now listen &gt;&gt; when you now marry that man &gt;&gt; as a virgin as a virgin even when you live with that man 100 years to God you are still a virgin. When you live with one man, go look. If you like give birth to 20 children in God's sight in God's kingdom, you are still a virgin. This is why you were not to break that seal with one man. When a woman went out, our sister, young woman, listen, when you go out like Dina and that seal is broken, God will mark you. When you did not marry that man, you become a sister qualified fil with the Holy Ghost and you want to now marry another person which you are qualified what God said. Tell that man you want to marry about that your seal that was broken. Tell him. If you did not tell him and you marry that man and you have three children, four children and discover he have a right to marry another person. You you can't marry again. This is the message of the hour. This is why Jesus you should know what you're doing. Don't let any man touch you from your head against you. And that is why every sin that a man commit can come under the blocks. But a girl that go out and fornicate and later now marry somebody else. But Abraham said she can be forgiven but she cannot be justified. The mark is on her because when God forgive you, he does not remember the sin again. this particular sin. I ever go forgive you, he will still remember it. He will still remember it. &gt;&gt; That's why we should teach our children free fornication. Free fornication. Don't let any man touch you as he has married you. &gt;&gt; Don't do that. &gt;&gt; There's a grievous consequence that go with it. consequence. &gt;&gt; This is the doctrine of the message. &gt;&gt; And a church without adultery is not the church. The backbone adultery is the backbone of the church. Backbone of the church. When you give birth to your daughters, hold their ear. This your se go there. Don't let anybody anything on your marriage. God says so. Unchangeable. God says so. Many people they will miss heaven because of these doctrines. &gt;&gt; Because of these doctrines. Because of these doctrines. Because this is what God is going to use to judge the whole world. Don't let any man touch you except the marriage that be pronounced. at the all time. Don't let any man kiss you because when a man kiss you and it's not your husband is a potential adultery. You must confess it or you go to hell &gt;&gt; because sex gland sex they in the lips. This is why we don't kiss our sisters when the Bible says only give a brother only kiss. &gt;&gt; It was a brother to a brother sister to a sister. &gt;&gt; When a brother want to kiss a brother, they will kiss it at the back of the ear. Bible call say give a brother a holy kiss. Holy kiss in the Bible. It was from a brother to a brother, sister to sister. A sister was not to kiss a brother. Adultery, a potential adultery. Brother kiss a sister is morally obligated to marry her or repent. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So youth, this is the word of God. This is the mind of God. This is why God call you a believer. Because when you a believer, you should practice what you believe. A man who call a preacher and he cannot practice what he preach. Stop preaching it. &gt;&gt; Stop preaching it. Stop preaching it. When you call a believer and you cannot follow the Bible instruction, you are not a believer. &gt;&gt; Nonsense. We are seeing the message today. &gt;&gt; Nonsense. [Music] Everywhere all tables are full of bomit. not see God manifesting our mess. [Applause] Foolishness everywhere. You see men behind the puppets. They'll be messing up with women. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; Shame on you. &gt;&gt; The last time I came here, when Pastor Albert Green came, Pastoral told me said, "Bro, &gt;&gt; I have another visitor. &gt;&gt; I want to send you somewhere so I can go and help the people there." He sent me to Rwanda. &gt;&gt; Okay. It was here I met that minister when I was in Kenya. I mean in Uganda then I called him. I want to just physically come. So I came I was taken to one church to preach. So while the preaching was going on the presence of God came down everywhere was full of in fact God came down. I called the ministers. I said please come lay hand on those people. There are too many for me so I pray prayer deliverance for them. one came to meet me. He said, "Pastor, I'm not qualified to lay hand on anybody." I said, "Are you not a servant of God?" &gt;&gt; I have to tell you the truth. He said, "You lay upon me." He said, "First of all, lay hand upon him to do deliverance for him." What was it? It was a sin of fornication. He has not had victory. He was still possessed with the demon of fornication and he was a pastor. When you are a minister and you are possessed with demo of anything that is not the Holy Ghost, that is the spirit you be spreading in the church. You can't give what you don't have. It is what you have you can give her. The people in the church will be fornicating the spirit that is in you. This is why nobody have a right to claim the puppet to preach the gospel. He has not met God face to face. Nobody. Nobody have a right. &gt;&gt; You may have your calling, &gt;&gt; but you must meet God to be filled with the Holy Ghost. Then you are qualified to stand behind a puppet and preach deliverance and people will be delivered because if you're not delivered, you can deliver anybody. Jesus, he look at Peter. He said Simon Simon Satan want to shift you like a wheat. I have pray for you that your faith not fail converted. No man is converted. The Holy Ghost have the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost give you power to cast out demons. And let me tell you something. When you are preaching under the influence of the Holy Ghost, demons are scattered in your church. That's why I believe now are scatter because the spirit of God will anoint you to preach deliverance. And every message you preach will be a message of deliverance because you have been delivered. You take a delivered man to deliver somebody. And that's why you saw the seven of scas they went to go and meet a mad man. I said in the name of Jesus that Paul preached that Peter preach said I know Jesus I know Paul who are you demon know you know me they can't leave when they know you one controlling your life they can't leave anybody. They can't. And many times when a minister stand behind the pulpit say many times, pastors allow evil spirit to sit down in their churches. allow evil spirits to enter the object. Our gathering is not the gathering of foul spirits. It's not the application of foul spirit [Music] of every unclean bed when you see a sister coming to church and is dressing naked when the pastor of the Holy Spirit he will cast it out. I didn't say you should cast out by the gospel by the gospel through your preaching. That demon will not be comfortable. He will leave. What are we saying? went through sex. Our ways were perverted. Our ways were as serpent meet the woman. [Music] Before Adam made the woman, serpent made the woman. planted an evil seed inside our womb. That is the beginning of the serpent seed. Every child that will come on earth from that time that through the womb of a woman was of a few days and full of trouble. He was born in sin. shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies. This is why you don't tell children, you don't teach them how to tell lies. There is something I see in our churches these day that we are not teaching our children. The Bible says teach the children the way they should go that when they grow up they shall not depart. It is a commandment of the scripture. It's a commandment of the Lord. But many of us believe we are failing. And let me tell you what what you get. Whatever you sow, you will reap it. When we fail to teach our children, they will give us trouble. This is what was going on in the believer cycle. Now, we don't teach our children. Do you know the prophet taught me and you every house should have a family altar? &gt;&gt; Every house family al family altar that they meet God in the morning and in the night. It is a recommendation of the scriptures because the Bible says we should teach them the way they should go that when they grow up they should not depart. Even when they try to depart the thing we not depart from them in the morning. But Abraham said, "We have to gather our family together and pray with them and read the Bible and talk to them." Brother Abraham said that was what Jesse was doing and David catch the revelation that they covenant people that they covenant people. That was why he killed the beer, he killed the liar, kill Golars. It was what the father taught him in the family altar said we should have it. &gt;&gt; He said we should give our children Bible teach Bible story told us that is the respect of a woman. He said the mother is the fifth gospel. She's the pastor of the house children. You should teach them about God because if you did not do that, Satan will give them inspiration and they will give you problem. Our women today, many of them are guilty. Many of they are guilty. Many of them are guilty. And you'll be wondering when your daughter want to marry when your daughter want to marry is looking for unbeliever to marry. Your son want to marry is looking for believer to marry. The foundation is the cause. Foundation is the cause. Because we have been taught, &gt;&gt; we have been taught under no circumstance, &gt;&gt; under no circumstance should a believer marry a nonbeliever. Under no circumstance a believer should marry a believer. And if you want to marry, the prophet said, marry a man that believe exactly like you believe. Marry a woman that believe exactly what you &gt;&gt; because if you didn't do that you will have problem today. What are we seeing in our churches divorce divorce? Lose puppets, lose family, lose children. Miracle for churches should be far from us. God hate divorce. God hates God hate it. And this is why we should be taught that this is not the will of God. We are the people of God. &gt;&gt; We should follow the will of God. &gt;&gt; Where you want to marry say sit down and think about it. Put it to God in prayer. Why? Because God is the one that know the heart of any man. Let me tell you something told us as we are sitting down here even in heaven when there are meeting going on Satan come to attend the meeting. So if Satan can still go to heaven to attend meeting, what about our meeting? When we gather together, we bring somebody in and sit down quietly. He will behave like a brother. He be like a sister. He's not a sister. He's not a brother. are broken to cause confusion cause confusion to cause confusion and that is why when you are a brother you are looking for a sister a wife. How do you know the one that Satan brought? How do you know the one that God brought? Only one person know that and that is God. And this is why you must seek the face of God. When a sister comes to your mind, go and meet God. Is this your will for me? Is this your will for me? Don't look at education. Don't look at job. Don't look at money. look away to Jesus [Music] because that thing will cause you problem in your life. And &gt;&gt; let me tell you something. When Satan cannot get you in the way of salvation, he will wait for you in the way of marriage. That's why this marriage we talking about, it is marriage that will take many people to hell. your salvation God has chosen it but marriage you choose for yourself that is why you must be careful don't choose by sight don't choose by beauty don't choose by popularity the father is a pastor the mother is a this don't choose by that choose by faith Today we are begin to be calculating people's life. This brother he had just finished for university. He has good future. Who told university give future? Who told you that university give good future? Future come from God. Because our life is in the hand of God. We begin to calculate. He just finished university. He has a good job. He has a good house. He has a good future. You are the one calculating. God says so. And you will see a brother that love God. He's filled with the Holy Ghost. He's still trusting on God to have his feet on the ground. To have his feet on the ground to have his feet on the ground. He's trusting God. He's looking onto God. Then you will look at that one. He doesn't He say doesn't have future. You are calculating. You are calculating. You are calculating. You are using your eye. Your eye will fail you because Christian does not look by sight. You walk by faith. &gt;&gt; That brother that say doesn't have future. Do you know what will happen to him 3 minutes from now? Many times it's a testing church. It's a testing. testing our little sisters because many of them today all their eyes &gt;&gt; is on Tik Tok, Facebook, &gt;&gt; WhatsApp WhatsApp. [Music] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; Tik Tok will fail you. WhatsApp WhatsApp fail you WhatsApp you can never fail you. &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; God can never fail you. &gt;&gt; So don't look at those we have been insulted. &gt;&gt; Look away to Jesus. &gt;&gt; What am I saying? Brothers and sisters we came perverted and that is why God take it upon himself that is coming for our redemption. This is why when you look at the book of revelation chapter 5 when that book Adam missed that book of life the thing went back to the hand of God and when they were calling who was worthy to come and look at the book nobody in heaven on earth beneath the sea nobody was that was why John cried because if nobody come that book. Humanity is lost. Names are written there, names are written and humanity is lost. This is why John was crying. When John was crying, he was crying. The one of the elders, he touching, he said, John weep not the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the book. As John turned to look, he saw a bleeding lamb. He saw a bleeding shaking lamb. The lamb came and took the book. John said when he took the book, all the host of heaven, they bowed down for worship. Worthy, worthy is the lamb. Worthy, worthy is the lamb. Worthy, worthy. John said when that lamb took the book, he said creatures in heaven, creatures on earth the sea, they had me scream, there was a revival, there was a joy, there was a lamp to open the book and the Bible that has been open. That is why our names has been declared. Every time you see a minister behind the popping, he's calling names and I believe when you are a redeemed product and you hear your name, you will answer and I believe that's why we are here. So brothers and sisters, what am I telling you? We are the purchased possession of Jesus Christ. Therefore, God was made flesh to share his blood to claim you and me back to life because we are part of life, back to the world, back to light. We are not of darkness. We are of light. And the message of this hour has been vindicated to bring us back to life because he promised that at the evening time there shall be light and the message of the hour is the light of this hour. That is why when you receive it, you are quickening. He quicken you from darkness to light from death to life. That is why the Bible said, "He that heareth my word and believeth to he that sent me, he has eternal life. He shall not come to condemnation. He has passed from death to life. We are children of love. We are carrying the love of God and the love of God is the word of God. That's why I say my words by words their spirit and their life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the power &gt;&gt; that is in us. This is the power that is in us. The power that is in us is the word of God. &gt;&gt; And God is the most powerful. So when you have that word of God in you, you have God. And when you have God, you have the power of God. And there is nothing can conquer the power of God. Say we are more than conqueror. We are more than conqueror. Nothing can conquer. Flesh, Satan, word, unbelief. They under your feet because you are a conqueror. You walk over there. They're under your feet. They don't rule you. This is why Paul said, "Sin shall not have dominion over you." Because it has been conquered. And as you have received before God, you are walking over sin. Under your feet, under your feet. It's not by calculation. Under your feet. You above Satan. You're above unbelief above the world. Why? Because of the power that is in you. And that power is God himself. That's why he said, he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world. He said again, though I walk through the valley of shadow of death, I fear no evil because thou are with me. Though the world shake fear because God is in us. This is why signs, &gt;&gt; science, &gt;&gt; signs and wonders, miracles, they follow us. We don't run after them. They follow us. We are carrying the word. We are carrying the word. The word of God is with me. Signs and wonders are following me. The signs shall follow those that believe in my name, they shall cast a demon. So because of the power in you, demon cannot stand. When you stand before demon. Yes sir. Because of the power that is in you. And that power is the word of God. So brothers and sisters, are you here this afternoon? Have you received the power? Have you received the word? When you receive the word, you receive the power. Because when you have that word, you are full of power. &gt;&gt; So brothers and sisters, why we bow our heads? Think on this. What is in you? Is it the word of God? Because the word of God is living and powerful. Everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's above everything or it is the cosmos system in you was in you. Something must be in you. You cannot be empty. Either you are full of religion or you are full of the word of God. Religion and the word of God are two different things. God did not come to give us religion. He comes to give us life and life is in the word. So as you think on those things, search yourself. What is in you? Is it the word of God or is it cosmos? Talk to God in your own way. Search yourself. There's a song say me. &gt;&gt; I know my thoughts today in number 16. Set me, oh Savior, know my heart. I pray see if there be some wicked way in me. Cleanse me from every sin and save me. In number 16, &gt;&gt; oh God, my heart, oh try me, oh Savior, Oh my those I pray [Music] see [Music] some wicked way in me.
