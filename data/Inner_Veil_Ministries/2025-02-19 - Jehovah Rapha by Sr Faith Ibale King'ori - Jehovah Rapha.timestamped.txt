[0:02] hello we've
[0:05] got all of you pass it over and pray we
[0:09] are having a very serious problem here
[0:12] praise the
[0:13] Lord for this song I just want to say
[0:16] one thing boy who works at the house to
[0:21] help and get
[0:24] some kind of
[0:26] paing to kind of returnal them because
[0:30] they don't want the smell of
[0:32] paraffin so the mistake he did he
[0:36] brought the paraffin poured it in a
[0:39] water bottle put it at the door and then
[0:44] had to
[0:45] return uh the rest of the paraffin to
[0:48] where we used to keep it away from the
[0:51] house it was in The
[0:53] Farmhouse and little did he know that
[0:57] the two little girls my
[1:01] grandchildren that is
[1:04] RMA and Salma they were just around and
[1:09] they share everything they get they were
[1:12] two and three at the time and so you
[1:16] know Sarah gets the bottle of paraffin
[1:21] drinks it and then gives to her sister
[1:26] and now they started falling back lack
[1:29] of oxygen and they were
[1:31] chalking it was such a shock when my
[1:36] wife in the kitchen screamed and said
[1:39] Harry we came and they were coughing
[1:43] they were completely out of oxygen
[1:47] supply there was such a panic we put
[1:50] them in the car I started drive hoting
[1:54] so bad that everybody has to get out of
[1:58] the way and we get to
[2:01] hospital at that particular time there
[2:04] was such a jam on the road many trucks
[2:08] back and forth I had to drive pushing
[2:12] through and then as we were driving
[2:16] Faith was crying that Rema is
[2:20] dying and she was literally going the
[2:24] eyes were rolling up and now I said
[2:27] where is she place my hand so I placed
[2:32] the hand we were praying as we were
[2:34] going forth and by the time we got to
[2:37] the hospital it was such an emergence
[2:40] the quantity that was ingested was big
[2:44] and we really didn't know how and why
[2:47] but by Grace we reached there they put
[2:51] them on oxygen to excel that you know
[2:55] paraffin and they were telling us the
[2:58] worst mistake we did was to force milk
[3:02] in Rema and she was so bad off because
[3:06] we had the idea milk would expel it and
[3:09] then for S she was such a tough girl
[3:14] that she refused the milk in that kind
[3:17] of time she was a fighter she couldn't
[3:20] take it and then when we took them to
[3:23] hospital you know Rema was in such a bad
[3:26] situation all the you know know exhale
[3:31] was paraffin the water urine was
[3:35] paraffin the back was parine and it was
[3:39] so bad they were on oxygen for 3 days
[3:43] the Lord delivered them so as we were
[3:47] going Faith started singing these words
[3:51] of the song that she's going to sing now
[3:54] I don't know whether she has ever sung
[3:56] it before but it was pleading to the
[3:59] Lord
[4:00] that God would save us from two copses
[4:03] in the house in one day God bless
