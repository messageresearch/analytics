[15:38] And why do you doubt?

[15:50] Have you [singing] ever asked of him
[15:56] and [music] you've [singing] not
[15:58] received?
[16:01] [music]

[16:21] why do [singing] you doubt?
[16:25] [music]
[16:27] Yes. [singing] Why do you doubt?
[16:33] Has he ever failed you?
[16:37] [singing and music]
[16:40] Have you ever asked of
[16:43] [music and singing] him?
[16:46] Oh, and you've not received.
[16:50] [music]
[16:52] Oh, [singing] he's still the same.
[16:58] [music and singing] Yesterday, today,
[17:00] forever.
[17:02] [music]
[17:05] So [singing] he's asking [music] you
[17:11] why do you [singing] die?
[17:14] [music]
[17:19] There's a story [music] in the Bible
[17:22] of a [singing] man known as [music]
[17:25] Peter.
[17:30] Oh, [singing]
[17:31] he [music] and the disciples
[17:35] saw Jesus [singing]

[17:49] [singing] walk with [music] him.
[17:55] Oh, [singing and music] but then he
[17:58] looked back.
[18:00] Jesus then asked [music] him, "Peter,
[18:05] why [singing] do you doubt?"
[18:10] Oh, why do you doubt?
[18:14] Has he ever failed you? Has he ever
[18:19] failed you?
[18:23] Have [music] you [singing] ever asked of

[18:29] [singing and music] Oh, and you've not
[18:31] received.
[18:35] For
[18:37] still the [singing] same
[18:42] yesterday, [singing and music]
[18:43] today forever.
[18:47] [music]
[18:49] So [singing]
[18:50] he's asking you
[18:55] [music and singing]
[18:55] why do you doubt
[19:00] [singing and music]
[19:03] for many a time [music and singing]
[19:07] we faced with diverse trials. [music]
[19:12] We go through so many trials [singing]
[19:14] in life
[19:16] and then [music]
[19:17] we wonder
[19:19] if [singing] Jesus really is watching.
[19:23] [music]
[19:25] Friend, don't be discouraged.
[19:27] Oh friend, don't be discouraged
[19:30] [singing and music]
[19:32] for
[19:34] watching over you. [music and singing]
[19:38] And in the evening time, wo [singing]
[19:41] and in the evening time
[19:46] [music] it shall [singing] be like.
[19:52] Oh, so why do you die?
[19:56] Has he ever failed you? Has he ever
[20:01] failed [music and singing] you?
[20:04] Oh, have you ever asked
[20:08] [singing] of him and you've not
[20:10] received? [music]
[20:12] And you've not [singing] received.
[20:15] He's still the same yesterday, today.
[20:18] Oh, he's still [singing and music] the
[20:20] same.
[20:24] Yesterday, [singing and music]
[20:25] today, and forever.
[20:31] Oh, so he's [singing] asking
[20:34] you
[20:36] [music]
[20:38] why do you [singing] doubt? One more
[20:41] time together. The chorus. Oh, so
[20:43] [singing]
[20:44] why do you [music] doubt?
[20:49] Oh, has he [singing]
[20:51] ever failed you?
[20:56] And have you [music]
[20:58] ever [singing] asked
[21:00] of him
[21:03] and you've [music and singing] not
[21:05] received
[21:08] for [singing]
[21:11] still [music] the same
[21:15] for [singing] yesterday
[21:17] and done [music] forever.
[21:23] So he's asking [music and singing] you
[21:30] why do you [singing] die?
[21:37] Amen.
[21:39] Never doubt in your heart
[21:42] even when we are going through diverse
[21:44] trials.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; [music]
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:57] I just want to sing with [music] you. If
[21:58] you can get on your feet, we sing this
[22:00] song 91.
[22:03] Say, I am going through. I am going

[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray.
[1:13:08] Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:13:11] Christ, [music]
[1:13:12] we are thankful unto you this morning.
[1:13:16] The grace that you've given unto us,
[1:13:18] Father, [music]
[1:13:19] that we can come into your presence,
[1:13:21] Lord.
[1:13:23] You've told us in your word, [music]
[1:13:26] that we should not forsake assembly
[1:13:28] together of believers.
[1:13:31] And here we've come to fulfill that
[1:13:32] word. [music]
[1:13:35] You also promised, Father,
[1:13:37] that when two or three are gathered in
[1:13:39] your name,
[1:13:41] you will be there in their midst.
[1:13:44] And Father, we believe you're in our
[1:13:46] midst. [music]
[1:13:47] We come to worship you, Lord. We've come
[1:13:50] to glorify your holy name. We've come to
[1:13:53] magnify your holy name. May you bless
[1:13:56] us, Lord. [music] May you speak to us,
[1:13:58] Father. May you reveal yourself to us,
[1:14:00] Lord.
[1:14:02] May you manifest yourself to us Lord and
[1:14:04] show us the path that we have to take.
[1:14:07] We love you father and we thank the
[1:14:09] Lord. Bless these services Lord
[1:14:13] upon them Lord. Lift our brothers and
[1:14:16] sisters into your hands
[1:14:18] who are not able to be here because of
[1:14:20] different reasons.
[1:14:22] May your grace reach unto [music] them
[1:14:24] far.
[1:14:26] Lord you may meet all their needs. We
[1:14:28] even pray for our pastors and ministers.
[1:14:32] anoint him heavenly father for the
[1:14:34] services of the lord and bless us all
[1:14:37] together
[1:14:38] in the name of the lord Jesus to pray
[1:14:40] and ask this [music]
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; amen you may be seated
[1:14:46] I greet in the name of our lord Jesus
[1:14:48] Christ [music]
[1:14:50] I know there are many caught up by the
[1:14:52] weather
[1:14:56] but we thank God for everything
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our lord
[1:15:01] There are number of people I know are
[1:15:02] not around because of different reasons
[1:15:06] like those of brother Dann and the
[1:15:10] family
[1:15:13] they went yesterday
[1:15:15] they are attending today
[1:15:19] then brother Fred and the families are
[1:15:21] not around today
[1:15:25] praise the name of our lord and then our
[1:15:28] sister Janat Oo
[1:15:32] I remember she was admitted yesterday at
[1:15:35] Whispers Hospital in the evening
[1:15:40] because she was bleeding at home
[1:15:45] and she was just only left with two
[1:15:46] weeks to give birth.
[1:15:50] Unfortunately, by the time they reached
[1:15:51] hospital, [music]
[1:15:54] they did the scan
[1:15:56] and they found the child was lifeless.
[1:16:01] So they rushed her in the theater
[1:16:04] and then operated her.
[1:16:08] Thank God she came out. [music]
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; But then our brother Richard and sister
[1:16:13] Juliet
[1:16:17] they had to travel that same night for
[1:16:19] the burial of that
[1:16:21] [music] you know still birth
[1:16:26] going to
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; So now we just need to keep them in our
[1:16:31] prayers.
[1:16:33] You know our sister Janette is always
[1:16:35] not coming here at church [music]
[1:16:38] because she has a back problem.
[1:16:42] [music] You know because it is quite
[1:16:43] hard for her
[1:16:46] and so we just keep them in [music] our
[1:16:47] prayers
[1:16:49] that the grace of God may reach unto
[1:16:51] them
[1:16:53] to help them in that kind of situation.
[1:16:54] [music]
[1:16:55] Praise the name of our Lord. Our pastor
[1:16:58] is also not around
[1:17:00] today. He's preaching [music] in brother
[1:17:02] Andreas's church.
[1:17:06] [music]
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; So just keep him in your prayers.
[1:17:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Do we have
[1:17:12] any visitors coming here for the first
[1:17:13] time? If you can raise up [music] your
[1:17:15] hand,
[1:17:19] you're welcome also.
[1:17:21] We happen to have you around today.
[1:17:24] [music]
[1:17:24] Let me just make Jonah stand up. J if
[1:17:27] you can stand up.
[1:17:29] [music]
[1:17:30] I hope you remember him.
[1:17:34] You can sit down. We were studying here
[1:17:36] at high. [music]
[1:17:41] There were three of them. There was
[1:17:43] David and Wliffe [music]
[1:17:46] and you know because of the world
[1:17:50] most of them to Campala. [music]
[1:17:54] David is still studying. He's finishing
[1:17:56] his course at [music] University
[1:17:57] Business School.
[1:18:02] But I can't tell much about weekl
[1:18:06] but we thank Jonah
[1:18:08] he now prays from lifeboat church
[1:18:14] and we thank God that [music] he has
[1:18:15] come back
[1:18:17] during these holidays.
[1:18:19] Praise the name of our Lord. We thank
[1:18:21] God for the grace he's giving us.
[1:18:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Day by day
[1:18:27] we can live for him.
[1:18:32] [music]
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; We started the the morning exaltation on
[1:18:37] the seven seals.
[1:18:43] [music]
[1:18:44] On Monday we started on the seven seals
[1:18:49] that was on 22nd of December.
[1:18:53] [music]
[1:18:54] It may take us the whole of next year.
[1:18:58] Praise the name of our Lord because we
[1:19:00] are taking studies
[1:19:06] a big [music] volume
[1:19:11] and I would really call upon you to be
[1:19:13] interested.
[1:19:16] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; We had been before the other week we had
[1:19:21] finished the seven church age book.
[1:19:25] We started the seven church age book
[1:19:27] daily exaltations on 14th of April this
[1:19:30] year.
[1:19:36] it on December that was last week still
[1:19:41] [music]
[1:19:42] we took about 190 days
[1:19:46] [music]
[1:19:48] from Monday to Friday
[1:19:50] those who have been consistent
[1:19:55] every day I believe there's something
[1:19:57] that has been added to [music] you
[1:20:00] then there are those maybe they I don't
[1:20:03] care. I don't know. [music]
[1:20:06] But we need to take these things as what
[1:20:09] the Holy Spirit is guiding us into.
[1:20:14] [music] Praise the name of our Lord. You
[1:20:17] know the Bible says
[1:20:19] comes in an hour
[1:20:22] when you don't expect [music] it.
[1:20:25] So make sure that whatever God is
[1:20:28] releasing,
[1:20:31] [music] just receive it.
[1:20:33] be part of it.
[1:20:36] That's the same challenge Elijah was
[1:20:38] telling Elisha.
[1:20:42] He first told Elisha,
[1:20:45] "Stay here."
[1:20:47] Elisha said, "I'm not going to leave
[1:20:48] you. He go to another city. Stay here."
[1:20:53] Because he was telling him, "Stay here.
[1:20:56] God has sent me."
[1:21:00] Now for you to know what the mind of God
[1:21:02] is,
[1:21:05] follow the person God is revealing
[1:21:06] himself to.
[1:21:09] That's what Elisha was doing. Said if
[1:21:11] God has sent you there,
[1:21:14] then God is also interested in me being
[1:21:15] there.
[1:21:18] So he kept on following
[1:21:20] until he he crossed the Jordan
[1:21:24] and then [music] he told him, "Y what do
[1:21:25] you want me to do for you?"
[1:21:28] You don't ask him at Dan
[1:21:30] or at Jericho or Beth but until Jordan.
[1:21:36] And then we said, "What do you want me
[1:21:38] to do for you?" He said, "I want a
[1:21:41] double portion of your spirit."
[1:21:45] And then Elijah told him, "If you see me
[1:21:49] being taken away,"
[1:21:54] and that's what we need to do now.
[1:21:56] is to watch [music]
[1:21:59] to see every step the spirit is moving.
[1:22:03] Let me know what is the spirit speaking
[1:22:05] [music] to us on Wednesday.
[1:22:08] Let me know what is the spirit speaking
[1:22:09] to us on a Sunday.
[1:22:12] What is the spirit speaking to us in the
[1:22:13] radio program?
[1:22:16] What's the spirit speaking to us in the
[1:22:17] directation?
[1:22:20] Then you will not be able to miss.
[1:22:24] But sometimes when you are not there
[1:22:27] like when Thomas was not there
[1:22:30] Christ came in their mid
[1:22:33] and you know we are going to have a last
[1:22:35] right
[1:22:38] [music]
[1:22:41] anytime we don't maybe today maybe
[1:22:44] tomorrow maybe this week maybe next
[1:22:48] month maybe next year but what our
[1:22:51] responsibility is
[1:22:54] be always ready.
[1:22:56] Praise the name of the Lord. So I
[1:22:58] encourage you to keep on listening this
[1:22:59] morning exotation.
[1:23:02] [music]
[1:23:03] Take interest in these things.
[1:23:06] Praise the name of our Lord. [music] I
[1:23:08] don't if we are going to have a song
[1:23:12] reading of the word.
[1:23:16] Praise the name of our Lord. We just we
[1:23:19] can move being led by the spirit of
[1:23:22] [music]
[1:23:24] Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:31] [music]
[1:23:42] [music]
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:23:53] [music]
[1:24:14] [music]
[1:24:26] [music]
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; song says, "I have prayed for you."
[1:24:32] Amen. [music]
[1:24:35] Let's start at the chorus.
[1:24:38] And I have prayed for
[1:24:40] [music and singing] you
[1:24:42] that thy faith will not fail you.
[1:24:45] [music]
[1:24:47] It's perfect faith [singing]
[1:24:51] rooted in my love.
[1:24:54] [music]
[1:24:56] When the [singing] devil comes like a
[1:24:59] flood,
[1:25:01] [music]
[1:25:01] I will raise [singing] the standard of
[1:25:04] pray for you. Your faithfulness [music]
[1:25:09] will not fail.
[1:25:12] The devil comes to steal. [music]
[1:25:17] Kill [singing] and destroy
[1:25:20] [music]
[1:25:21] like a lion
[1:25:24] roaring,
[1:25:26] roaring.
[1:25:29] [music] You see the tempter.
[1:25:33] He's a [music] deceiver.
[1:25:38] And he's looking
[1:25:41] he's looking [music] for your soul.
[1:25:45] But I am [singing] praying for you
[1:25:49] that [music] I fear will not fear you.
[1:25:54] It's my [music and singing] faith
[1:25:58] rooted in my love. [music]
[1:26:03] When the [singing] devil comes like a
[1:26:06] rock,
[1:26:09] I will raise [singing and music] the
[1:26:10] stand that I pray for you. Your
[1:26:14] faithfulness
[1:26:16] will not [music and singing] fail.
[1:26:20] Trials and temptations,
[1:26:24] loss and despair [music]
[1:26:29] may pretend
[1:26:31] to knock [music] you off your mind.
[1:26:36] But at [music] your confession,
[1:26:41] oh strengthen your [singing] brother,
[1:26:44] strengthen your sister. I'm trying to
[1:26:46] [music] say,
[1:26:48] but I'm overthrown. No mercy. [music]
[1:26:53] But I have [singing]
[1:26:56] that. [music]
[1:27:00] [singing]
[1:27:02] It's nothing
[1:27:04] [music]
[1:27:06] in my [singing] life. [music]
[1:27:11] When the devil [singing] comes,
[1:27:16] I will raise the sun.
[1:27:18] [music and singing]
[1:27:21] Your faithfulness.
[1:27:24] [singing]
[1:27:29] [music]
[1:27:37] [singing]
[1:27:41] My
[1:27:42] [music]
[1:27:46] go
[1:27:50] [music and singing]
[1:27:54] for you. Your faithfulness [music]
[1:27:56] [singing]
[1:27:57] will not.
[1:28:00] And when the temple [music and singing]
[1:28:03] comes like a flood,
[1:28:07] I will raise the stand [singing] that I
[1:28:10] wait for you. [music]
[1:28:12] Your faithfulness
[1:28:15] will not fade.
[1:28:17] Amen.
[1:28:19] [music]
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've prayed for you. Praise the
[1:28:25] name of our Lord. Amen. For them.
[1:28:28] [applause] Amen.
[1:28:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:36] We have we happy to have sister Ruth
[1:28:38] around.
[1:28:41] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:28:43] So this afternoon we are going to have a
[1:28:45] youth meeting
[1:28:49] those who are out of school.
[1:28:53] Then next Sunday
[1:28:55] we're also going to have two services.
[1:28:59] The afternoon will be for the youth in
[1:29:01] school.
[1:29:03] Praise the name of our Lord. On
[1:29:06] Wednesday
[1:29:08] is the last day of this year,
[1:29:12] 31st of December.
[1:29:15] So we are going to have an afternoon
[1:29:17] service.
[1:29:19] So come knowing that we are starting our
[1:29:22] service at 300 p.m.
[1:29:27] And then we are from the after the
[1:29:29] service
[1:29:30] we shall have the Lord's supper and foot
[1:29:33] washing
[1:29:35] we shall not have any service on
[1:29:37] Thursday which is the new year.
[1:29:42] Praise the name of the Lord. Then
[1:29:44] tomorrow
[1:29:46] the youth meetings in GA are starting.
[1:29:51] up to Thursday.
[1:29:54] Would encourage parents to support their
[1:29:55] children to be part of those meetings.
[1:30:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Just be
[1:30:04] part and serve the Lord can bless you.
[1:30:09] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[1:30:11] stand up the word.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Let us pray first.
[1:30:17] Father, we thank you and give praise to
[1:30:19] your holy name.
[1:30:23] Now we approach the preaching of the
[1:30:26] word
[1:30:28] and you already told us the word of God
[1:30:31] is of no private interpretation
[1:30:36] but was given by the inspiration of the
[1:30:38] Holy Spirit.
[1:30:41] And we pray that the same Holy Spirit
[1:30:45] will come and take this word
[1:30:47] and put it in our hearts
[1:30:50] that may be able to bear fruit, Lord.
[1:30:54] And we pray that your grace be upon
[1:30:56] every one of us this morning.
[1:30:59] Even those who are on online services,
[1:31:03] your grace may reach out unto them far
[1:31:07] that each and every one of us
[1:31:10] may be converted
[1:31:12] that we may be like our Lord Jesus
[1:31:14] Christ. We love you and we bless you.
[1:31:18] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:31:20] pray and ask this.
[1:31:22] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; So we go to Luke chapter 22
[1:31:28] verse 31 and verse 32.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:31:36] Luke 20:31-32
[1:31:39] the Bible says
[1:31:42] and the Lord said Simon Simon behold
[1:31:46] Satan has desired to have you that he
[1:31:49] may sift you as wheat.
[1:31:52] morning.
[1:32:06] But I've prayed for you that your faith
[1:32:09] fail not, and when you are converted,
[1:32:13] strengthen thy brethren.
[1:32:24] May God blessing of his word
[1:32:27] may be seated.
[1:32:29] So by the grace of God
[1:32:32] I want to preach on the subject
[1:32:35] when you are converted.
[1:32:39] Praise the name of our Lord. when you
[1:32:42] are converted.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Now to be converted
[1:32:50] is to be turned into another person.
[1:32:57] Praise the name of our Lord. be turned.
[1:33:02] Now like for example
[1:33:05] when prophet Samuel
[1:33:09] when he met Saul
[1:33:13] and he knew that Saul was the one God
[1:33:17] has chosen to be the king over Israel.
[1:33:23] So he anointed Saul.
[1:33:27] And when he anointed Saul,
[1:33:29] he told him, "As you go,
[1:33:32] you will meet people prophesying.
[1:33:37] And when you meet them and they are
[1:33:39] prophesying,
[1:33:41] the spirit of God will come upon you
[1:33:45] and then you will become another
[1:33:48] person."
[1:33:51] Praise the name of our Lord. I just want
[1:33:52] to pick up that scripture.
[1:33:55] So let us go to the book of 1 Samuel.
[1:33:59] Praise the name of our Lord. In the book
[1:34:02] of 1 Samuel
[1:34:05] and then we go to chapter 10 and verse
[1:34:08] one.
[1:34:13] So the Bible says,
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; "Then Samuel took the vial of oil and
[1:34:21] poured it upon his head and kissed him
[1:34:24] and said, "It is not, is it not because
[1:34:27] the Lord has anointed thee to be captain
[1:34:30] over his inheritance?
[1:34:50] And then in verse five, he said, "After
[1:34:53] that, you shall come to the hill of God,
[1:34:56] where is the garrison of the
[1:34:58] Philistines, and it shall come to pass
[1:35:01] when thou art come thither to the city,
[1:35:04] that thou shalt meet a company of
[1:35:06] prophets, coming down from the high
[1:35:09] place with a pulsey and a tablet and a
[1:35:12] pipe and a harp before them. And they
[1:35:15] shall prophesy.
[1:35:53] and the spirit of the Lord shall come
[1:35:56] upon you And you shall prophesy with
[1:35:58] them, and you shall be turned into
[1:36:01] another man.
[1:36:15] Praise the name of our Lord. He said,
[1:36:16] "You shall be turned into another man."
[1:36:21] So conversion
[1:36:24] comes by the spirit of God.
[1:36:28] In other words, you have allowed the
[1:36:30] spirit of God
[1:36:33] to come and take charge over your life.
[1:36:37] Praise the name of the Lord. When the
[1:36:39] Bible tells us in John chapter 3,
[1:36:44] And then in verse six,
[1:36:47] the Bible says that which is born of
[1:36:50] flesh is flesh.
[1:36:54] And that which is born of the spirit is
[1:36:56] spirit.
[1:36:58] Now our first birth,
[1:37:01] we were born of flesh.
[1:37:04] We were born of the will of our parents.
[1:37:08] You were born as flesh and blood.
[1:37:12] That's the first birth.
[1:37:14] That's who we are in in this world now.
[1:37:18] We were born here on earth.
[1:37:21] And as you were born here on earth,
[1:37:25] you know, you partake of the physical
[1:37:27] things
[1:37:30] because you were born flesh and blood.
[1:37:33] So then you have the earth as your home.
[1:37:38] You have your inheritance here on earth.
[1:37:42] like in any family you find a father
[1:37:45] saying I'm going to give this land to my
[1:37:46] children
[1:37:48] this property to my children
[1:37:51] but now that is born of flesh
[1:37:55] but then you see that our first birth
[1:37:59] says that which is born of the flesh is
[1:38:03] flesh and that which is born of the
[1:38:05] woman is over a few days. So our first
[1:38:10] bus is of a few days and the Bible says
[1:38:15] it is full of trouble.
[1:38:18] Praise the name of our Lord. It doesn't
[1:38:20] matter where you have been born.
[1:38:24] Whether you born in a gola,
[1:38:27] there is trouble in a golof.
[1:38:30] Whether you are born in a white man's
[1:38:32] land,
[1:38:35] praise the name of our Lord. I need to
[1:38:37] go to America. We need to go to America.
[1:38:40] They have similar troubles like we have.
[1:38:44] Praise the name of Lord. They have
[1:38:46] similar troubles.
[1:38:49] And you know the sun is the same.
[1:38:53] Praise the name of So when you go there,
[1:38:55] you're not going to another heaven,
[1:38:58] another world.
[1:39:01] The systems may be different
[1:39:04] but they are grass
[1:39:06] is also green like ours.
[1:39:11] Praise the name of it's the same son.
[1:39:15] They also cry for the rain to rain.
[1:39:19] Oh when is it raining?
[1:39:21] And then the problem there
[1:39:24] rains are so dangerous. Sometimes
[1:39:29] they have things like typhoon,
[1:39:34] terrible winds which can move at 300 km
[1:39:38] per hour.
[1:39:44] The Bible says he that is born of a
[1:39:47] woman is of a few days and is full of
[1:39:51] trouble.
[1:39:53] Whether you're born in a rich man's
[1:39:55] house,
[1:39:56] or born in a poor man's house or you are
[1:40:00] born as a prince
[1:40:03] or you are born as a laborer's child.
[1:40:10] Travel is everywhere.
[1:40:13] Praise the name of Lord. So that's why
[1:40:17] we need to desire the new birth.
[1:40:21] So he says that which is born of flesh
[1:40:23] is flesh.
[1:40:26] And that which is born of the spirit
[1:40:29] is spirit. Now to be born of the spirit
[1:40:34] is the new birth
[1:40:36] is our conversion.
[1:40:38] To be born of the holy spirit.
[1:40:41] And then he the prophet was telling saul
[1:40:45] that when the spirit of god comes upon
[1:40:47] you
[1:40:49] be turned into another man.
[1:40:53] And then here Jesus was telling Peter
[1:40:57] when you are converted.
[1:41:00] So he was showing him that the spirit is
[1:41:04] going to come down
[1:41:06] and you are going to be born of the
[1:41:08] spirit.
[1:41:10] Now when you are born of the spirit of
[1:41:12] God,
[1:41:14] you are born from above.
[1:41:17] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[1:41:19] are born of the spirit of God, you are
[1:41:22] born from above.
[1:41:25] And that should be our desire.
[1:41:28] When you accept the Lord Jesus as your
[1:41:30] personal savior,
[1:41:33] don't stop at that.
[1:41:35] When you go into water baptism,
[1:41:38] don't stop at that. When you come to
[1:41:41] church, don't stop at that. Go further.
[1:41:46] Make sure that you are born from heaven.
[1:41:49] Praise the name of our Lord. That should
[1:41:51] always be our desire when you come into
[1:41:55] the presence of God. Lord, I want to be
[1:41:58] born again. Lord, I want to be
[1:42:00] converted.
[1:42:02] Lord, I want a new life.
[1:42:04] I want to become a new creation.
[1:42:07] That's something which should bring
[1:42:09] comfort to your soul. Something that
[1:42:11] should bring rest.
[1:42:14] Praise the name of our Lord. rest where
[1:42:17] it's no longer I that liveth
[1:42:22] but Christ that liveth.
[1:42:24] That should be our desire every day.
[1:42:27] But then the challenge that we have
[1:42:29] nowadays
[1:42:31] is people start the journey
[1:42:34] and they walk a little
[1:42:37] and they get contented.
[1:42:41] I'm already in a message believer.
[1:42:44] I know who the prophet of the hour is.
[1:42:47] I know this. I know this. That's my
[1:42:50] church. That is my pastor. And then they
[1:42:54] relax at that. But you really need to go
[1:42:57] further than that
[1:42:59] and have a personal relationship
[1:43:03] with the Lord Jesus Christ. Without a
[1:43:06] personal relationship with the Lord
[1:43:07] Jesus Christ,
[1:43:09] you can never be born again.
[1:43:12] You can never be converted.
[1:43:15] And when you are not converted,
[1:43:18] you are not born from above.
[1:43:20] Praise the name of God. Just the way the
[1:43:23] Bible says that our citizenship
[1:43:27] in Philippians 3:20,
[1:43:30] our citizenship
[1:43:33] is in heaven.
[1:43:35] Now, how do you say you're a city of
[1:43:37] citizen of heaven
[1:43:40] when you have never been born there?
[1:43:43] Praise the name of the Lord. You know,
[1:43:45] you can't just go to somebody's house
[1:43:49] because he's your friend and
[1:43:54] I want my inheritance.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; This man is a cheat
[1:43:59] then even you how do you
[1:44:04] going to heaven?
[1:44:07] Is it your home? [laughter]
[1:44:12] So if you have not been born from above,
[1:44:15] you can't go in heaven
[1:44:17] because it's not your inheritance. It's
[1:44:19] not your citizenship.
[1:44:23] So you must first be born from above.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Then you can say that I'm going home.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; That's what says you read Philippians
[1:44:36] 3:20.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Our heaven
[1:44:47] Philippians 3:20.
[1:45:05] Our conversation is in heaven. Our
[1:45:08] citizenship is in heaven.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Our citizenship is in heaven.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Now you see the mix.
[1:45:14] [laughter]
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; So
[1:45:21] if our citizenship is in heaven,
[1:45:24] you must be born in heaven.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; And that's what we are talking about
[1:45:28] this morning.
[1:45:30] Be born in heaven.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; And it's not difficult.
[1:45:35] Praise the name of our Lord. There is
[1:45:38] not a special labor somewhere
[1:45:43] that now maybe this is the church where
[1:45:45] there is a labor
[1:45:48] and maybe this is the special midwife
[1:45:54] no
[1:45:56] once you here
[1:45:59] conversion can take place.
[1:46:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us
[1:46:04] go into this message.
[1:46:07] He says,
[1:46:09] "So did the apostles in the message why
[1:46:12] it had to be the shepherds.
[1:46:16] So did the apostles.
[1:46:20] They wasn't born again
[1:46:24] until they received the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:28] They wasn't even converted
[1:46:32] until they had received the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:36] You remember the night before betroal,
[1:46:41] just before betrayal took place,
[1:46:44] Jesus said to Simon Peter,
[1:46:48] "When you are converted,
[1:46:53] then strengthen thy brethren."
[1:46:57] And Peter had followed him for three
[1:47:00] years and a half
[1:47:04] and had cast out devils
[1:47:07] and healed the sick and preached the
[1:47:10] gospel
[1:47:12] and still
[1:47:14] according to the word
[1:47:17] was not even converted.
[1:47:21] Praise the name of our Lord. If I can
[1:47:24] get the mic.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; So he says Peter preached the word.
[1:47:31] Peter
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; was praying for the sick and they were
[1:47:34] being healed.
[1:47:37] Peter was casting out devils
[1:47:42] and still he was not even converted.
[1:47:47] And you find many people in that kind of
[1:47:50] situation.
[1:47:53] I'm a message believer and they are
[1:47:56] contented with that.
[1:47:58] Now when you ask them about their
[1:48:02] personal relationship with Christ,
[1:48:06] they're not sure.
[1:48:08] They're not sure.
[1:48:11] They're just afraid.
[1:48:14] You know it's one way or another
[1:48:18] reject him at a particular point
[1:48:23] and they deny him at a particular point
[1:48:27] and they continue moving on in their
[1:48:29] life
[1:48:31] and then at the death bed
[1:48:37] they come to their normal senses.
[1:48:45] What shall I do? When they come to the
[1:48:47] reality
[1:48:50] life here on earth is over
[1:48:53] or it's coming to an end
[1:48:56] but ahead of me. It's not clear.
[1:49:00] What a terrible condition.
[1:49:03] They get in a situation of a fearful
[1:49:05] situation,
[1:49:08] you know, kind of getting trying to see
[1:49:10] that the the darkness ahead.
[1:49:15] They find there is horror ahead
[1:49:20] coming back to their senses.
[1:49:24] But then sometimes it can be late.
[1:49:28] So now the preaching of the word
[1:49:32] is meant to make you awakened
[1:49:36] to find out where he is in your life.
[1:49:39] Where have you left him? Praise the name
[1:49:42] of Lord. Have you left him
[1:49:45] by not coming to church? Say Lord help
[1:49:48] me to improve in this area.
[1:49:51] Have you left him in not praying to him?
[1:49:55] Have you left him in not reading the
[1:49:58] word? Have you left him in not living a
[1:50:01] Christian life? Have you left him? You
[1:50:05] know, you're not doing the things which
[1:50:06] are necessary.
[1:50:08] Lord, have mercy upon him.
[1:50:11] Like David, he committed adultery.
[1:50:16] He killed and it went a whole year
[1:50:21] and he supposed with God.
[1:50:24] And many people get themselves in those
[1:50:25] kind of conditions,
[1:50:28] a whole year,
[1:50:31] a whole long period,
[1:50:34] a whole long stretch.
[1:50:38] But God who is rich in mercy,
[1:50:41] sent the prophet.
[1:50:44] And David was contented in himself
[1:50:47] righteousness.
[1:50:50] When the prophet told him, there was a
[1:50:53] man
[1:50:54] a rich man and a poor man. And then the
[1:50:57] rich man went and took the poor man's
[1:51:00] sheep.
[1:51:02] David in his own self righteousness,
[1:51:06] he judged the rich man.
[1:51:09] He needs to be killed.
[1:51:12] And sometimes people can get in that
[1:51:14] condition.
[1:51:16] Me, I'm a message believer. I've been
[1:51:19] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[1:51:22] go to church.
[1:51:23] I do every obligation I'm required to
[1:51:27] like the richer.
[1:51:31] I've done everything.
[1:51:33] What lucketh I
[1:51:36] then the Lord told him. Go and sell what
[1:51:40] you have
[1:51:42] and then give to the poor and then come
[1:51:44] and follow me.
[1:51:47] And the Bible says that was a hard
[1:51:50] saying.
[1:51:53] And sometimes
[1:51:55] you may also be hearing things
[1:52:00] are hard. Me a youth
[1:52:03] to put on long dresses.
[1:52:08] That's a hard saying.
[1:52:12] They will call me
[1:52:16] Judger,
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; old fashioned.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; So, and then some of our sisters,
[1:52:25] you not know how they dress, you go to
[1:52:27] where they work. If you want to know how
[1:52:29] they dress,
[1:52:31] you go where they work on Monday like
[1:52:34] tomorrow. They have special wardrobe for
[1:52:38] work.
[1:52:42] tight,
[1:52:44] short
[1:52:46] with a slit,
[1:52:50] very comfortable.
[1:52:52] And they move with the smallest in the
[1:52:54] back,
[1:52:57] one which matches that clo.
[1:53:05] She goes to the bathroom
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; and then puts it around
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; or hides behind and then grabs herself.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Then you start wondering is your clothes
[1:53:14] stained or what?
[1:53:19] It has been torn but is making a show
[1:53:22] up.
[1:53:32] How about before God?
[1:53:37] the richer.
[1:53:39] It was a hard saying
[1:53:44] and some of the word you may say.
[1:53:52] It was a hard saying.
[1:53:56] Now you know the rich young ruler's
[1:53:59] problem
[1:54:02] was the things he had
[1:54:07] was the things he had
[1:54:09] where the hindrance
[1:54:12] to have a personal relationship with
[1:54:15] God.
[1:54:17] And you may have also some situations in
[1:54:19] your life which are a hindrance
[1:54:22] to your relationship with God.
[1:54:25] When Jesus went to the house of Zachas,
[1:54:31] the Bible says he was a rich man.
[1:54:34] He was a tax collector.
[1:54:37] But Jesus never told him, "Leave your
[1:54:40] job."
[1:54:41] Jesus never told him, "Sell all that you
[1:54:44] have." Jesus never told him, "Give what
[1:54:47] you have to the poor." His
[1:54:50] heart,
[1:54:52] the heart of Zakas
[1:54:54] was fully willing to receive the Lord
[1:54:56] Jesus.
[1:54:58] Until when Jesus went to his home,
[1:55:01] the man got in a station of repentance.
[1:55:06] Yes, this he gives this one here. I'm
[1:55:08] going to pay back this. I'm going to pay
[1:55:10] back this.
[1:55:12] What was it? It was the presence of God
[1:55:14] that inter
[1:55:17] it brought him to conviction
[1:55:20] and desire to do what was right. And
[1:55:23] then the Lord Jesus says today his
[1:55:26] salvation come into the world.
[1:55:28] Praise the name of our Lord. So how
[1:55:31] about you?
[1:55:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Peter, they
[1:55:36] were walking with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:55:38] They were doing the miracles, doing the
[1:55:41] signs, preaching the gospel.
[1:55:44] But Peter denied the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:55:49] You can also be in the same condition.
[1:55:52] When he's not inside of you,
[1:55:55] you can deny him. When he's not inside
[1:55:58] of you, you'll forget him.
[1:56:02] For Judah says,
[1:56:04] "It was
[1:56:06] he sold him.
[1:56:10] because he was not inside here.
[1:56:15] Sold him.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Now you look at the situation of Peter.
[1:56:21] Let us go to Matthew chapter 26 and
[1:56:23] verse 69.
[1:56:28] Matthew 26
[1:56:30] verse 69.
[1:56:35] Now Peter sat without in the palace, and
[1:56:38] the damel came unto him, saying, Tho
[1:56:40] also was with Jesus of Galilee.
[1:56:44] But he denied before them all, saying, I
[1:56:47] know not what you say.
[1:57:12] Peter was afraid
[1:57:16] to identify himself with Christ.
[1:57:20] And there are people who are afraid to
[1:57:24] identify with the Lord
[1:57:31] at their places of work.
[1:57:34] They are afraid.
[1:57:36] Maybe they are sitting in a meeting
[1:57:40] who can pray for us
[1:57:43] down.
[1:57:47] Or when they know there's an item of
[1:57:49] prayer,
[1:57:52] that's the time to excuse to go to the
[1:57:53] toilet.
[1:58:00] Then
[1:58:03] when they hear they finished then he
[1:58:06] comes back.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Peter
[1:58:11] afraid
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; to identify himself with Christ.
[1:58:16] When you are not converted,
[1:58:19] that's what happens. When you are not
[1:58:22] converted, you'll forget God.
[1:58:26] You'll deny him.
[1:58:28] You can even sell him.
[1:58:31] When you are not converted,
[1:58:34] now the Lord was telling Peter,
[1:58:37] when you are converted, he was calling
[1:58:40] him to a higher level.
[1:58:43] He was calling him to a better
[1:58:44] relationship.
[1:58:47] I want you to be converted
[1:58:50] and when you are converted
[1:58:52] you will strengthen your breath.
[1:58:55] Praise the name of our Lord. So when he
[1:58:58] denied
[1:59:04] that one is finished. He will never
[1:59:05] bother me again. And he sat there
[1:59:09] watching. Then again another came
[1:59:12] and when he was gone out into the porch
[1:59:16] another maid saw him and said unto them
[1:59:19] that were there this fellow was also
[1:59:22] with Jesus of Nazare.
[1:59:38] You know, there are some trials God
[1:59:39] permits to come your way
[1:59:43] to make you understand your condition.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; He brings it back.
[1:59:54] I thought I'd finished this thing.
[1:59:57] You didn't finish it well.
[2:00:00] So, he brings it back
[2:00:03] again. This
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; you're not learning.
[2:00:08] He denied again.
[2:00:11] Then he pretended
[2:00:15] and again he denied with an oath. I
[2:00:19] don't know the man.
[2:00:27] And after a while came unto him they
[2:00:29] that stood by and said to Peter, "Surely
[2:00:33] you are one of them, for even the way
[2:00:35] you speak shows you're one of them.
[2:01:01] Then he began to cuss and to swear
[2:01:04] saying, "I don't know the man." And
[2:01:07] immediately the coke crew.
[2:01:17] When you are not converted,
[2:01:21] you live in
[2:01:34] I don't understand what you are saying.
[2:01:36] Aren't you the one who prays from?
[2:01:40] It's a mistaken identity.
[2:01:46] Deny.
[2:01:49] And that's what the devil wants you to
[2:01:50] do.
[2:01:52] He wants you to deny your faith.
[2:01:56] He wants you to deny your relationship
[2:01:58] with God.
[2:02:01] So that's why we need to desire
[2:02:05] to be converted.
[2:02:07] When you are converted,
[2:02:09] you can't deny it.
[2:02:12] I am the man.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; I'm the one.
[2:02:19] It is me who walked who walked with him.
[2:02:23] The Bible says
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; verse 75,
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; "And he began it to curse and swear,
[2:02:29] saying, I know not the man." And
[2:02:31] immediately the crew. And Peter
[2:02:33] remembered the word of Jesus, which said
[2:02:35] unto him, Before the crew, "Thou shalt
[2:02:38] deny me thrice." And he went out and
[2:02:41] wept bitterly.
[2:02:56] Now
[2:02:57] Peter here is not even being beaten
[2:03:01] but is denying him
[2:03:04] because he's not converted.
[2:03:07] So you can also deny the word of God
[2:03:11] in your daily walk.
[2:03:14] You deny the word of God to guide you in
[2:03:16] your living.
[2:03:19] You deny the word of God to deny you the
[2:03:21] way you do work, your work.
[2:03:25] You deny the word of God to guide you at
[2:03:27] your school.
[2:03:30] You deny the word of God to make you
[2:03:33] guide you at your home.
[2:03:36] You know, you want to do the things like
[2:03:39] the way the world does.
[2:03:41] You are denying him.
[2:03:43] You are ashamed of him.
[2:03:47] You feel shy about him.
[2:03:50] You feel offended because of him.
[2:03:55] I don't want my friends to know that I'm
[2:04:00] not know that the devil is taking a hold
[2:04:02] of you
[2:04:04] because your protection
[2:04:06] is your confession.
[2:04:08] The moment you deny him,
[2:04:12] the devil has taken a hold of you.
[2:04:15] So now the Bible here says Peter went
[2:04:19] out and wept bitterly.
[2:04:24] Christ had given him a sign
[2:04:27] when the coke crows.
[2:04:31] And when the co
[2:04:34] Jesus turned his eyes,
[2:04:36] looked at Peter, Peter looked at him. He
[2:04:40] remembered and he went out and wept
[2:04:43] bitterly.
[2:04:46] Now he was not yet converted. That's why
[2:04:49] he would do all those kind of things. So
[2:04:52] he told him when you are converted.
[2:04:56] Now we see in the scriptures
[2:04:59] they were preaching the gospel
[2:05:02] and people were becoming born again.
[2:05:06] So in the book of acts
[2:05:09] they went and arrested Peter and the
[2:05:11] rest of them.
[2:05:15] And when they arrested them they took
[2:05:18] them and started beating them.
[2:05:22] and told him don't speak again in the
[2:05:25] name of Jesus.
[2:05:27] Peter because he was converted.
[2:05:31] He told them should we fear you or we
[2:05:34] fear God?
[2:05:36] They were here. He was beaten
[2:05:39] there. They didn't beat him but he was
[2:05:42] denied. But after conversion
[2:05:45] when he was beaten he wouldn't deny him.
[2:05:50] Why? He was inside of him.
[2:05:54] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[2:05:55] should be our desire.
[2:05:58] Lord, enter inside of me. That even when
[2:06:01] I'm at my place of work,
[2:06:04] it doesn't matter. The Lord is with me.
[2:06:08] Praise the name of our Lord. Like
[2:06:10] Daniel, at his place of work, they made
[2:06:14] the Lord was funny.
[2:06:18] But Daniel said, "I'm going to stand by
[2:06:20] my conviction."
[2:06:23] And then they came and arrested him
[2:06:26] thinking that he would change. They
[2:06:28] wouldn't pull it out of Daniel. They put
[2:06:31] him in the lion's den.
[2:06:34] Praise the name of our Lord. The three
[2:06:36] Hebrew children
[2:06:38] thrown in the fire. But what was inside
[2:06:41] of them
[2:06:43] was a living reality.
[2:06:46] And that should be the same thing with
[2:06:47] us. that when you are faced with
[2:06:50] challenges,
[2:06:51] when you are faced with temptation,
[2:06:54] when you are faced with trials,
[2:06:56] let God remain God in your life.
[2:07:00] Have a true testimony about it.
[2:07:04] Praise the name of our Lord, not a
[2:07:07] changing situation.
[2:07:11] Now, in the message, God's provided way
[2:07:13] of healing.
[2:07:18] He says,
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; "Notice,
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; no man can have faithful healing until
[2:07:25] it is revealed to him by the Holy
[2:07:27] Spirit.
[2:07:38] that is going to be well.
[2:07:41] You might stumble at it.
[2:07:44] You might go through life living a good
[2:07:47] Christian life.
[2:07:51] You might belong to some church.
[2:07:54] You might have fine membership.
[2:07:58] You might be a moral character
[2:08:03] and all of that. But brother,
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; that
[2:08:09] still isn't Christianity.
[2:08:14] Christianity
[2:08:16] is when the Holy Ghost
[2:08:19] has taken full possession of you
[2:08:24] and you are led by the Holy Spirit,
[2:08:29] no matter how good,
[2:08:33] how moral,
[2:08:35] how good a church member,
[2:08:39] Kane was as good as any church member.
[2:08:42] Cain was as good as any church member.
[2:08:46] So Esau was
[2:08:48] fine cultured gentleman
[2:08:52] was Cain very religious
[2:08:56] believed in God made sacrifice
[2:09:00] built a church altar
[2:09:02] done all things that is religious
[2:09:06] and God refused him.
[2:09:09] Then he said, "Peter has been justified
[2:09:12] and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:09:16] He even preached the gospel." But Jesus
[2:09:19] told him, "After you are converted,
[2:09:24] strengthen your brethren,
[2:09:27] after you are converted."
[2:09:31] Conversion
[2:09:33] is the Holy Spirit
[2:09:36] that moves the old nature out
[2:09:42] and the new nature comes in
[2:09:46] which is the Holy Ghost. And when a man
[2:09:49] has truly been born of the spirit of
[2:09:51] God,
[2:09:54] he has everlasting life.
[2:09:58] And that's where we all need to get to.
[2:10:02] I need to be changed.
[2:10:04] I need to be born again. I need to be
[2:10:06] filled with the Holy Spirit. I'm not
[2:10:08] contented about my own life, but I want
[2:10:12] the Holy Spirit
[2:10:14] to come down in my life.
[2:10:17] And it's not difficult.
[2:10:19] He needs you a total surrender.
[2:10:24] Just give yourself to him.
[2:10:29] You know, like God was telling Cain,
[2:10:33] if you do well,
[2:10:35] you'll be accepted.
[2:10:38] It's the same thing to us.
[2:10:41] If you can do well,
[2:10:44] you can say, "Lord, I need your Holy
[2:10:46] Spirit.
[2:10:48] I need a change of my heart.
[2:10:51] I need to be born again."
[2:10:54] And he does it.
[2:10:56] Praise the name of Lord. When Isaiah
[2:10:58] said a man clean,
[2:11:02] then the angel, the saraphim came and he
[2:11:05] was helped in his condition.
[2:11:09] Praise the name of the Lord. You also
[2:11:10] need to get into that kind of situation.
[2:11:14] where you can have a genuine repentance.
[2:11:19] A repentance.
[2:11:21] The Bible says when you have a contrite
[2:11:24] and broken heart
[2:11:29] in Psalms
[2:11:31] chapter 51
[2:11:34] and then verse 17
[2:11:37] the Bible says
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; the sacrifices of God are a broken
[2:11:41] spirit, a broken and contrite heart. Oh
[2:11:45] God, you will not despise.
[2:12:01] He says a contrite
[2:12:05] broken heart.
[2:12:07] That's what we need. Praise the name of
[2:12:10] the Lord. You have that heart
[2:12:13] contrite,
[2:12:14] broken.
[2:12:16] He says God will not despise.
[2:12:21] It should take your own interest.
[2:12:26] Be desirous of it.
[2:12:30] Like Cornerius.
[2:12:32] Praise the name of our Lord. We can talk
[2:12:34] about different conversions.
[2:12:37] Let us look at Cornarius's
[2:12:40] in Acts 10:33.
[2:12:44] that
[2:12:54] the Bible says when Cornerius was
[2:12:57] praying and fasting, [clears throat]
[2:13:00] when Cornelius was praying and fasting
[2:13:03] and then an angel came down from heaven.
[2:13:07] Now you may say, I wish God would send
[2:13:08] me also that angel.
[2:13:13] But you're hearing the word.
[2:13:17] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:13:21] If I was there in the times of
[2:13:24] the
[2:13:28] prophet begins to discern.
[2:13:31] Oh, you've been looking for the Holy
[2:13:33] Spirit. You're going to get him.
[2:13:36] We have the word here.
[2:13:43] Cornelius
[2:13:45] the angel came down the angel told him
[2:13:48] call for Peter
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; and Cornelius was faithful.
[2:13:55] He called for Peter and then invited his
[2:13:58] family and friends
[2:14:00] and told them what has happened. And
[2:14:02] then also came expecting
[2:14:06] and then they were waiting. And then
[2:14:08] Cornelius
[2:14:10] makes this confession in verse 33.
[2:14:16] And that should be our condition every
[2:14:18] time
[2:14:20] when we come into the presence of God.
[2:14:23] When you are coming to church,
[2:14:25] don't come just to see another person
[2:14:29] or to be seen,
[2:14:31] but come with a heart ready
[2:14:35] saying like Cornarius
[2:14:38] immediately. Therefore,
[2:14:41] I sent to thee,
[2:14:44] and you have done well that you are
[2:14:47] come.
[2:14:50] Now therefore
[2:14:52] are we all here?
[2:14:57] He said now are we all here
[2:15:00] not in my house
[2:15:03] not in church but in the presence of
[2:15:06] God.
[2:15:08] That's the respect you should come with
[2:15:10] to church.
[2:15:12] Coming before the presence of God. And
[2:15:15] so he says we are here in the presence
[2:15:18] of God.
[2:15:19] To do what? To hear not what we want to
[2:15:24] hear.
[2:15:30] Begin talk about
[2:15:33] all
[2:15:39] that God
[2:15:41] has commanded you. Whenever we come to
[2:15:44] church, that should be our desire to
[2:15:47] come to hear all
[2:15:51] a full course menu,
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; full course, balanced diet,
[2:16:02] you know, good meal,
[2:16:05] there are sweet things and bitter
[2:16:08] things.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; So when you reach those bitter berries,
[2:16:18] It will make you healthy
[2:16:22] when you reach where there is.
[2:16:27] Sometimes they they can even give you
[2:16:29] aloe vera.
[2:16:34] Drink it. It will make you good.
[2:16:38] Praise the name of the Lord. It will p
[2:16:41] some funny spirits.
[2:16:44] to p some bad thoughts
[2:16:47] to p some things here
[2:16:50] take it
[2:16:53] said
[2:16:56] whatever they will put on the table for
[2:16:58] me I'm going to eat
[2:17:00] maybe
[2:17:02] KFC chicken I will not look for
[2:17:08] KFC you only take the line of KFC here
[2:17:13] But there also other things somewhere
[2:17:15] here which are
[2:17:19] he says we are here to hear all
[2:17:24] that's the attitude that God wants us
[2:17:28] speak
[2:17:31] praise the name of our lord and then the
[2:17:33] bible says then Peter opened his mouth
[2:17:39] is a respect of no person,
[2:17:43] but in every nation,
[2:17:46] he that fearth him and workketh
[2:17:49] righteousness
[2:17:51] is acceptable with him. Praise the name
[2:17:54] of. So you must come with that kind of
[2:17:57] condition
[2:18:00] if you are to be converted.
[2:18:03] Heart attitude,
[2:18:05] you know, prepared.
[2:18:08] Lord, I'm here.
[2:18:09] Lord, I'm waiting upon you. Lord, I need
[2:18:12] the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lord, I
[2:18:15] need my heart to be changed.
[2:18:18] Lord, you know how you can help me. I
[2:18:20] don't know how I can help myself, but
[2:18:23] you can help me and we are surrendering
[2:18:26] myself to you.
[2:18:28] Praise the name of the Lord. And then
[2:18:29] the Bible says while Peter spoke these
[2:18:32] words
[2:18:35] because the hearts were already
[2:18:38] broken hearts. They were contrite
[2:18:41] hearts. The Holy Ghost just came down,
[2:18:45] converted them, filled them. Praise the
[2:18:49] name of the Lord. It's all about your
[2:18:51] preparation before the Lord.
[2:18:55] How are you ready?
[2:18:57] Look at the conversion of Saul.
[2:19:00] When Jesus revealed himself to Saul
[2:19:03] said, "I am Jesus."
[2:19:07] He became blind. They just took him to
[2:19:09] the city. And from that time, he started
[2:19:13] repenting.
[2:19:15] God,
[2:19:17] I have wasted your church. How I
[2:19:19] witnessed the death of Stevie. I give
[2:19:23] this three days praying and fasting.
[2:19:28] And then God tells Anas the prophet
[2:19:33] in the same city and tells him, "I'm
[2:19:37] sending you a man called Saul of Tarsis.
[2:19:42] He's in this house. He is praying."
[2:19:47] God recognized the desire of Saul.
[2:19:52] that he no longer wanted to live in that
[2:19:54] Pharisee life.
[2:19:57] He was no longer considering his
[2:19:59] Pharisee religion.
[2:20:02] who's no longer considering the
[2:20:03] righteousness of the Lord
[2:20:05] and say Lord have mercy upon him and
[2:20:08] then Lord tellas
[2:20:11] go to him
[2:20:13] lay your hands on him his eyes will open
[2:20:17] and you receive the Holy Spirit
[2:20:21] it was not difficult
[2:20:23] so when you hear the word of God how are
[2:20:26] you interested in the word
[2:20:30] how does the word create
[2:20:33] that thirsting
[2:20:36] for more of God in your life
[2:20:38] because the word of God is a deep
[2:20:43] calling to you that I'm here. I want to
[2:20:48] fill you.
[2:20:50] And the Bible says deep calls to the
[2:20:53] deep.
[2:20:55] So the word creates the deep.
[2:20:58] When you hear the word, it brings
[2:21:01] conviction.
[2:21:03] It causes a desire in your heart
[2:21:07] like when Cornelius heard. The angel
[2:21:10] telling him, "Send for Peter."
[2:21:13] He went on waiting
[2:21:16] praying, "Oh God, may you bring him
[2:21:18] safely. Lord, help my family. May they
[2:21:22] know what what you've made yourself
[2:21:23] known to." And when Peter came, he said,
[2:21:27] "We are here.
[2:21:29] I'm not in any rush to go anywhere
[2:21:32] [clears throat]
[2:21:34] like today you know there is a African
[2:21:37] football championship.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Now you can start looking at the time.
[2:21:51] No he was not in that rush.
[2:21:56] meeting
[2:21:58] is the youth meeting in the evening.
[2:22:01] Cornelius was not in that rush.
[2:22:05] He was ready
[2:22:08] to face it
[2:22:10] to surrender everything.
[2:22:13] Lord, I'm just here.
[2:22:16] Praise the name of our Lord. So, he was
[2:22:18] not timing himself.
[2:22:21] Do you know
[2:22:25] if it comes to
[2:22:30] I've given God until 1:00 and God is
[2:22:32] humble. They will say okay
[2:22:35] and brother Brennham says whatever you
[2:22:37] give him
[2:22:39] 10 minutes
[2:22:41] 5 minutes
[2:22:43] he takes it but you're doing yourself
[2:22:46] harm
[2:22:48] why don't you wait for the Lord
[2:22:51] say Lord I want to hear all your counel
[2:22:55] you know when you come into the presence
[2:22:56] of God
[2:22:58] you just don't want to leave that place
[2:23:01] because it is so Nice
[2:23:04] brother. Brandon was telling the people
[2:23:05] he was discerning.
[2:23:08] There's some strange feeling you're
[2:23:10] feeling.
[2:23:12] Sweet,
[2:23:14] calm,
[2:23:15] settled.
[2:23:17] Then he says that is his presence
[2:23:20] and that should be something which we
[2:23:22] experience every day in our lives
[2:23:25] because he's inside of you.
[2:23:29] You don't feel good because you have
[2:23:30] money.
[2:23:33] But the presence of God in your life
[2:23:36] will make you be settled.
[2:23:40] You know, be calm
[2:23:43] even in the midst of a lot of troubles
[2:23:45] around your life.
[2:23:48] So said we are here.
[2:23:51] He was ready
[2:23:53] to be converted.
[2:23:56] soul he waited say Lord you've revealed
[2:24:00] this to me
[2:24:02] change me I want to have that life
[2:24:06] like that life of Steven
[2:24:09] I remember when I was when they were
[2:24:11] stoning him
[2:24:13] said Lord I won't put it to their church
[2:24:18] and then brother Brandham says those
[2:24:21] words of Stephen
[2:24:23] kept on haunting Paul,
[2:24:26] how do you get a person you are killing
[2:24:30] and is praying for you good?
[2:24:33] Now, we need to come back to ourselves.
[2:24:36] Do you love your enemies?
[2:24:40] Praise the name of our Lord. That's a
[2:24:42] test.
[2:24:52] You want to check if you have the Holy
[2:24:53] Spirit? Do you love your enemies?
[2:24:56] Just that
[2:25:00] I will not tell you that you have to
[2:25:01] jump high.
[2:25:04] I will not tell that you have to speak
[2:25:05] in tong
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; but just to come at the end here.
[2:25:10] Do you have the life?
[2:25:13] Praise the name of the Lord. So Paul was
[2:25:16] busy waiting on the Lord.
[2:25:21] And can you imagine the way God does
[2:25:23] things? This man was blind but he was
[2:25:26] seeing a vision
[2:25:29] and he has coming to lay his hand on him
[2:25:31] praying for him.
[2:25:33] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[2:25:36] be converted.
[2:25:38] Soul had to go and face it.
[2:25:43] Take interest yourself.
[2:25:46] Spend time with God as an individual.
[2:25:49] Praise the name of the Lord. Take time
[2:25:52] as an individual.
[2:25:54] It may be at your home. It may any place
[2:25:57] you find it is convenient for you.
[2:26:00] Say, "Lord,
[2:26:02] I'm not interested in this life anymore.
[2:26:06] A life which is not true.
[2:26:10] Praise the name of our Lord." So Paul
[2:26:13] waited.
[2:26:16] There was a deep that was created in him
[2:26:20] when he met the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:26:23] A deep was created in him
[2:26:26] to desire more of Christ. And when we
[2:26:29] come to church, a deep is always created
[2:26:32] before us.
[2:26:34] And when that deep is created,
[2:26:37] there is a deep to fulfill that. And
[2:26:41] that's to take opportunity of that.
[2:26:43] Lord, I'm here. Lord, I'm here. Like
[2:26:47] Cornerius, I'm here to hear all
[2:26:52] to obey what you've told us
[2:26:55] deep calling to the deep. So the word of
[2:26:58] God, when you hear the word of God, it
[2:27:01] convicts you.
[2:27:04] It creates a deep in your heart.
[2:27:08] It creates a yearning in your life,
[2:27:12] a thirsting in your life. And then you
[2:27:15] thirst after righteousness.
[2:27:18] And then the Bible says in verse 56
[2:27:23] that when you get that thirst,
[2:27:28] you'll be filled. That's what the Lord
[2:27:30] does. So he says when you are converted,
[2:27:35] what does it mean? He wants to convert
[2:27:38] you.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. He wants to
[2:27:42] change your life.
[2:27:44] So you just allow him
[2:27:47] to take charge over your life.
[2:27:51] Praise the name of our Lord because of
[2:27:53] time. We may not go into many things.
[2:27:57] But now in the message the future home
[2:27:59] of the of the heavenly bridegroom and
[2:28:02] the earthly bride.
[2:28:08] Brother Brandham says here,
[2:28:10] "Notice how God makes it plain to us."
[2:28:16] Then he says,
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; "When I see this
[2:28:22] and see that since a boy,
[2:28:26] first time I ever I first time ever
[2:28:28] Christ dealt with me,
[2:28:32] I've still always taught those three
[2:28:34] stages of grace."
[2:28:39] So he's talking about grace.
[2:28:42] It is the same grace of God
[2:28:46] that takes you through justification.
[2:28:49] It's the same grace of God that takes
[2:28:52] you through sanctification.
[2:28:55] And it's the same grace of God that
[2:28:58] brings the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[2:29:00] That's how the Lord does. So he himself
[2:29:04] comes.
[2:29:05] What you need to do is to allow him
[2:29:09] to move you.
[2:29:13] He brings conviction in your heart.
[2:29:16] What he desires is your obedience.
[2:29:20] Lord, I'm here. Lord, I'm available.
[2:29:23] Tell me what to do and I'm going to do
[2:29:25] it. That's how conversion comes.
[2:29:29] Is you yielding yourself to the Lord.
[2:29:33] He says, "Repent.
[2:29:35] Repent. Be baptized. Be baptized. Obey
[2:29:40] the word. Obey the word. It's a response
[2:29:45] which is waiting upon us. And then you
[2:29:48] are converted.
[2:29:50] Then he says now the first step is
[2:29:54] repentance towards God.
[2:29:59] And then follows after that
[2:30:03] is water baptism.
[2:30:05] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[2:30:09] Jesus Christ. See water baptism follows
[2:30:14] showing that repentance
[2:30:17] was genuine
[2:30:19] to remit past sins
[2:30:23] that has nothing to do with the future
[2:30:25] sin.
[2:30:28] Now I want to explain this here. Now
[2:30:30] when you repent
[2:30:32] and you are baptized in the name of
[2:30:34] Jesus Christ,
[2:30:36] he takes care
[2:30:39] removes all your past sin
[2:30:43] from the time you were born at the time
[2:30:45] you accepting.
[2:30:47] But then the challenge is
[2:30:50] you still have the old nature
[2:30:54] which made you do the old sins.
[2:30:57] And this is where he wants to deal with
[2:31:01] after you are justified.
[2:31:03] So he comes in sanctification
[2:31:07] and we are sanctified
[2:31:10] by the blood of Jesus Christ. So he
[2:31:13] comes to see that he destroys that
[2:31:16] nature
[2:31:19] that life that made you desire to do
[2:31:22] things which are wrong.
[2:31:25] So then you go through sanctification.
[2:31:28] And now when you are sanctified
[2:31:31] is making you ready
[2:31:34] to be ready for service.
[2:31:38] Now when you are sanctified
[2:31:41] you are set aside for the service
[2:31:45] whose service God is very service who
[2:31:49] sanctifies you Christ himself.
[2:31:53] So it is the same spirit of God
[2:31:56] that justifies you by hearing the word
[2:32:00] of God. When you believe that word, you
[2:32:03] are baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:32:04] Christ, then you are justified.
[2:32:08] And then when you continue,
[2:32:10] Jesus told them, if you continue in my
[2:32:14] word,
[2:32:16] so in other words, you've started a
[2:32:19] journey of no retreat.
[2:32:24] You've already crossed the Red Sea.
[2:32:27] Don't desire the things of Egypt.
[2:32:31] But in the wilderness,
[2:32:33] he was teaching them to depend upon him.
[2:32:38] That's all the whole mission of the
[2:32:40] wilderness.
[2:32:43] When they were crossing the Red Sea,
[2:32:45] there was a lot of water. Praise the
[2:32:48] name of our Lord. They will even go and
[2:32:49] fetch the water using their hand.
[2:32:53] You know the water was the wall.
[2:32:56] So you can put your hand in it car.
[2:33:04] But 3 days
[2:33:06] there was no water.
[2:33:10] He was teaching them to depend on him.
[2:33:15] And that's the Christian journey.
[2:33:18] God teaches you to depend upon him.
[2:33:23] That's the Christian journey. Not your
[2:33:26] ability,
[2:33:27] not your strength, but the grace of God
[2:33:30] that comes.
[2:33:32] So he says they have not learned my
[2:33:35] ways.
[2:33:41] So when you come to Christ, he wants you
[2:33:44] to honestly depend upon him.
[2:33:48] like the Lord Jesus Christ, he says, I
[2:33:51] can do nothing
[2:33:53] except what I see my father do. So he
[2:33:56] was always depending
[2:33:58] on the leadership of the Lord.
[2:34:01] What the Holy Spirit was showing him
[2:34:04] then he does it.
[2:34:06] Praise the name of our Lord. When he
[2:34:08] goes to the pool of Basha,
[2:34:12] he gets there too many people are sick
[2:34:14] and in terrible condition.
[2:34:17] He had the power to heal all of them.
[2:34:20] But the father only wanted one person.
[2:34:23] So he went to that person. Rise up.
[2:34:27] The other man was giving excuses.
[2:34:30] You know whenever the angel comes,
[2:34:32] I'm not fast to be into the water.
[2:34:35] Another person goes after me. For many
[2:34:38] years I've been here.
[2:34:41] You stand.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; The man stood. Then others were
[2:34:44] wondering
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; what if what
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; it was not for them.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; Paul was walking with many people
[2:34:55] temple guards
[2:34:58] but Christ only revealed himself to Saul
[2:35:02] went back to do their work
[2:35:05] and they say we don't know what has
[2:35:07] become of this man we're moving with. We
[2:35:09] just saw him fall down. We had
[2:35:13] I just don't understand.
[2:35:15] We shouldn't be like those people. But
[2:35:18] when we come to Christ, let us be like
[2:35:20] Cornelius. Lord, I have come to hear all
[2:35:23] that.
[2:35:25] Praise the name of our Lord. So it is
[2:35:27] the same Holy Spirit
[2:35:30] that takes us through justification,
[2:35:34] sanctification, and baptism of the Holy
[2:35:36] Spirit. like we were seeing on
[2:35:38] Wednesday,
[2:35:41] Peter was telling them
[2:35:43] this promise.
[2:35:46] He didn't tell them that promise,
[2:35:50] but he was telling them it is here with
[2:35:53] us. Praise the name of our Lord. And I
[2:35:56] can tell you the same thing. The Holy
[2:35:58] Spirit is here with us. Praise the name
[2:36:02] of our Lord ready
[2:36:04] enter any heart that will receive
[2:36:07] you only need say Lord
[2:36:10] I give myself over to you take charge
[2:36:13] over my life
[2:36:15] he told them when you are converted that
[2:36:19] should be our desire Lord change me Lord
[2:36:23] deliver me Lord wash me from all
[2:36:26] unrighteousness
[2:36:29] from all uncleanness
[2:36:31] make me new. Is that your heart there
[2:36:34] this day?
[2:36:36] May God bless you. Amen. Amen.
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; Let us stand up and sing that song. I
[2:36:41] surrender.
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; Oh to Jesus I surrender
[2:36:47] and see that you die to yourself.
[2:36:51] You know you die to your needs. You die
[2:36:54] to your desires and say Lord I only need
[2:36:57] your desire.
[2:36:58] I only need your spirit.
[2:37:01] Brother Brham says
[2:37:03] died on the alt of his sacrifice. Abel
[2:37:07] died on the out of his sacrifice.
[2:37:10] You also need to die to the out of our
[2:37:11] sacrifice.
[2:37:14] Die to yourself. Die to your desires.
[2:37:17] Say Lord. It's only you that I need in
[2:37:21] praise the name of
[2:37:24] all [singing] to Jesus.
[2:37:28] I
[2:37:30] surrender
[2:37:32] all
[2:37:34] to him I freely.
[2:37:40] Halleluah.
[2:37:42] I will ever
[2:37:46] love
[2:37:48] and trust in [music]
[2:37:52] his presence.
[2:37:59] [music]

[2:38:08] eyes
