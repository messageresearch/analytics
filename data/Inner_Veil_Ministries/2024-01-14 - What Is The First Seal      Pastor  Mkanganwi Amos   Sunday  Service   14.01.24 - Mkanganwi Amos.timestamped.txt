[19:03] bring
[19:06] bring little want to
[19:09] [Applause]
[19:12] Jesus praise the
[19:14] Lord you see when I see pastors having
[19:20] children it looks strange to
[19:24] me but then I start remembering
[19:29] at one time I was pastoring and having
[19:33] children children are blessing from the
[19:36] [Music]
[19:38] Lord and
[19:41] um one
[19:44] time you know in a very big congregation
[19:47] bigger than
[19:49] this you know the parents brought their
[19:53] children to
[19:55] him that he should touch them
[19:59] and his disciples rebuked
[20:02] him you are wasting time we got so many
[20:04] other things to
[20:07] do but it displeases the
[20:10] Lord the lord loves
[20:14] children amen and he also advises
[20:18] us that if we are going to make it back
[20:23] home we must have the faith of the
[20:27] child believe the
[20:29] father in
[20:31] Simplicity you see I've got my
[20:35] grandchildren if I ever open my mouth
[20:38] and bring them a car like
[20:42] mine they'll believe
[20:44] it and when I go back home says D where
[20:47] is the
[20:50] car so we need to have a
[20:53] Fai like that of Little
[20:55] Children if we have to enter into the
[20:58] Kingdom so Jesus
[21:01] proceeded he took them up in his
[21:04] arms put his hands upon them and also
[21:08] blessed
[21:09] them are you together with me the
[21:12] parents just wanted let him touch
[21:16] them and the disciples said no no no no
[21:19] no but when Jesus allowed them to be
[21:24] BR he didn't only touch
[21:27] them so
[21:29] blessed and this is what we call the
[21:33] dedication of children none of the
[21:36] children are
[21:38] baptized but we bring them before the
[21:41] master so that he can touch them and he
[21:45] can bless them and protect them give
[21:48] them a good work and bring them to the
[21:52] altar say Jesus is Lord of
[21:56] M that's what we we are going to do this
[22:00] evening before we get our brother come
[22:02] speak to
[22:04] us amen
[22:18] amen so in our hands here we've got
[22:22] Emmanuel
[22:24] Doo and this
[22:26] Emmanuel This Little Child be a
[22:31] testimony that the Lord is a resident in
[22:34] this
[22:35] family amen Emmanuel God With Us let's B
[22:42] heads
[22:43] bless this little
[22:45] baby precious Heavenly
[22:48] Father we know that
[22:50] children are a gift from the
[22:53] Lord you give them to us
[22:56] Lord just to be be a way that you teach
[23:03] us father how to deal with the
[23:06] children and that way we can even
[23:09] recognize
[23:11] ourselves being your
[23:13] child they can make
[23:16] mistakes and we take it with
[23:18] Grace just like when we make
[23:21] mistakes father you receive Us by Grace
[23:25] you told us in the scripture
[23:28] that a
[23:29] minister must be a man who has brought
[23:31] up his children
[23:33] well and father this is what they are
[23:37] doing to raise the children in the fear
[23:41] of the Lord they know you give and they
[23:45] are giving back to you so in the name of
[23:48] Jesus I pray special
[23:51] blessing upon this little baby that
[23:54] father you may watch over him and take
[23:58] step with him help him heavenly father
[24:02] when the enemy tries to reach out his to
[24:05] touch we rebuke the enemy and we also
[24:09] pray that you may break every genetic
[24:14] chain that is
[24:16] negative and attaching itself upon this
[24:19] baby may this baby be free from the hand
[24:24] of the enemy that stretches to destroy I
[24:29] father I also pray in the name of Jesus
[24:33] that you may bless the father and father
[24:36] with their life that they walk that they
[24:40] may be a positive
[24:42] influence we also pray heavenly father
[24:46] that you may provide for them that they
[24:48] may take care of him we commit him into
[24:51] your heart if they appear tomorrow you
[24:55] us to witness Heavenly Father
[24:58] as he walks forward to take a Christ
[25:02] personally as his savior in Jesus name
[25:06] we
[25:09] [Applause]
[25:14] amen God bless you amen God bless
[25:19] you yes
[25:22] sir now when I was out in at lunch with
[25:26] the brother when
[25:30] I remember a brother who gave me a
[25:35] testimony uh he's called brother dra
[25:39] Fair brother dra fa is a
[25:43] pastor in one of the churches in
[25:46] Canada so he went to another
[25:49] church in edmont to
[25:52] preach in the middle of the
[25:55] service he got lost
[25:59] you know it's a
[26:01] very pathetic
[26:05] thing when a minister gets lost in the
[26:08] middle of a
[26:11] service sometimes you people think it to
[26:15] preach but it is not so when he got
[26:20] lost he just went back again into
[26:24] preaching the basics women don't put on
[26:28] clothes women must have their hair
[26:32] long boys you must you know he went
[26:35] around and Bap in
[26:37] Jesus he went around
[26:42] the he called the church to
[26:46] prayer and said
[26:48] amen he excused
[26:51] himself because he considered himself a
[26:54] defeated
[26:56] preacher so that he can walk
[26:59] away before you know he interacts with
[27:03] the
[27:05] people so three months later or
[27:08] so they went
[27:11] fishing and one of the
[27:13] brothers came from that church where
[27:17] he and so he said oh brother nice to see
[27:24] you he says yeah yeah yeah says I'm
[27:28] brother so and so and I come from such
[27:31] and such a
[27:32] church he said my heart dropped to
[27:37] the because I knew he was going to talk
[27:41] about that
[27:43] service he says that's exactly what he
[27:47] did he said do you remember that service
[27:50] when you came to our
[27:54] church he said yes yes sir
[27:59] and then he says that was the best
[28:01] service
[28:05] ever he says I looked him in the
[28:08] face I said how can you say
[28:12] that say you know we had two
[28:15] ladies they used to come to church they
[28:19] really loved coming to church they would
[28:22] dress well coming to church but outside
[28:25] there they were as wild as the world can
[28:30] be clothes and all kinds of stuff he
[28:34] says when you preached they ran home
[28:38] they got their clothes set them on
[28:44] fire and says the mother started
[28:46] shouting at them says what's happening
[28:50] to you they preached back to
[28:53] her and she also brought her clothes and
[28:55] they were back
[28:58] and he says the following week the three
[29:01] were
[29:04] baptized so God knows how to use this
[29:10] Serv amen God bless you as you listen to
[29:15] brother
[29:18] [Applause]
[29:26] welome
[29:56] is this loud enough
[30:00] can hear me at the
[30:02] back now is got
[30:10] alive again I would like to appreciate
[30:12] and thank
[30:17] brother for inviting
[30:22] me and I would like to say God bless you
[30:26] to him even though is not at
[30:32] this I must also mention special thanks
[30:40] to God bless
[30:49] you like I did in the
[30:52] morning I'm going to tell you I'm going
[30:54] to preach for 1 hour
[30:59] so the service this afternoon will be 1
[31:01] hour until qu to
[31:09] 5 and
[31:12] that's as the Lord leads and I believe
[31:15] he has already led
[31:19] me say 1
[31:25] hour the
[31:27] sometimes when you are landing and the
[31:29] weather is not very
[31:32] good you make a short nearby cir to land
[31:36] after 5 or 10
[31:40] minutes I may go on until 5
[31:45] but to
[31:54] finish I'm going to be looking at you
[31:56] and and asking God for a message again
[32:00] this
[32:06] afternoon I'll start off with a little
[32:10] testimony I had gathered people from our
[32:14] church in
[32:17] har for the usual
[32:20] service people from out of town I had
[32:23] invited them
[32:26] in and from a place
[32:29] about
[32:32] 240 200 kilm
[32:37] away they recruited a person who was not
[32:40] yet born
[32:43] again so he was sitting in the
[32:46] church he was a man of course I'm saying
[32:52] here when you look at him back
[32:56] view if you look at him back
[32:59] view you would think he's a
[33:03] woman because his hair was long down to
[33:11] there and it's a shame for a man to have
[33:15] long hair like
[33:18] that saying
[33:20] it is Paul who said
[33:23] it in Corinthians 11
[33:27] it's a
[33:29] shame so I preached
[33:34] repentance and
[33:37] I made an altar call which I didn't do
[33:40] this
[33:41] morning I believe the Holy Ghost spoke
[33:43] to
[33:44] somebody and after the altar call this
[33:47] man
[33:49] repented gave his life to the
[33:51] Lord we had two
[33:54] Services we took a break for about 2
[33:58] hours and that man young
[34:01] man rushed to the
[34:06] bar got a clean
[34:11] haircut like me like
[34:14] this from Mr
[34:18] dread to Mr
[34:24] baldheaded so I was
[34:27] told I was so
[34:30] excited I said hey young man
[34:34] come giving his
[34:36] testimony he was sitting at the balcony
[34:39] we do have a balcony at
[34:41] church he was sitting way up there so
[34:46] under the balcony yes he was under the
[34:49] balcony stood up then he walked to the
[34:53] front he came and stood by me
[34:57] I gave him a
[35:00] [Music]
[35:02] hug this didn't happen that
[35:10] time and I was so happy and the church
[35:15] wasy so
[35:21] re we're not preaching to win an
[35:25] argument preach get this
[35:32] house wonder if I should just go on with
[35:34] this testimonies it's only one
[35:37] hour I want to speak something so I read
[35:41] my scripture
[35:43] shortly when the boy was
[35:45] coming the
[35:48] platform he was a worldly boy with
[35:52] worldly
[35:55] posture
[35:58] he dealt
[35:59] with was just the hair at that
[36:03] time walking to the
[36:06] pit he was walking you see how I'm
[36:10] walking like a
[36:23] man so the walk had not been dealt with
[36:26] [Music]
[36:29] but the hair was dealt
[36:32] with one thing at a
[36:36] time where the
[36:37] [Music]
[36:39] tree will
[36:42] fall so when I saw his walk I
[36:46] knew there's more work to be
[36:49] done but when I saw his
[36:52] head I said there's been a lot of work
[36:55] done
[36:58] so we're not looking for overnight
[37:03] jobs not what I used to
[37:07] be I haven't become what I should
[37:10] be but I thank
[37:13] God because of the work in
[37:18] progress so when we talk about something
[37:21] you are not proper
[37:25] regarding
[37:27] don't tell us about your
[37:30] successes the great works you have
[37:32] done we're talking about your hair sort
[37:36] that
[37:38] out and when we find your hair is
[37:41] fine and you can touch
[37:43] it then you find us talking about
[37:45] something
[37:47] else because we preparing for the
[37:50] Rapture has
[37:54] made amen
[37:57] so let me draw your attention to a
[38:00] scripture
[38:07] reading around which I will talk for
[38:10] about an
[38:17] hour give me Revelation
[38:25] chap
[38:30] I'll
[38:31] read verse one
[38:37] to speak a little more on the others as
[38:45] well remember in the
[38:48] morning we said
[38:51] something we said when
[38:55] saw
[38:57] what was happening in
[39:00] Athens his Spirit
[39:02] was he responded what he
[39:06] saw he could not ignore
[39:10] it
[39:12] then I gave an example to say if I see
[39:16] an ugly snake coming
[39:19] in
[39:23] respond and then proceed with whatever
[39:28] and this afternoon I'm drawing your
[39:30] attention to John the of
[39:36] pmos he was
[39:40] instructed in chapter
[39:43] one what you
[39:45] see write in a
[39:48] book and send the
[39:51] book the seven churches in
[39:54] Asia so here we
[39:57] reading and I
[40:00] saw he is on a mission to
[40:05] see and he comments on what he
[40:12] sees That's What I Call
[40:17] preaching if I see I must
[40:22] respond depending on who I am I may be
[40:24] rough or polite but I'm
[40:34] I saw in the right hand of him that set
[40:36] on the
[40:40] throne
[40:42] within and on the back
[40:45] side and
[40:47] sealed with Seven
[40:49] Seals and I saw a strong
[40:53] angel proclaiming with a loud voice
[40:58] who is worthy to open the
[41:00] book and to lose the seals
[41:03] there and no man in
[41:07] heaven no man in
[41:10] earth neither under the
[41:13] Earth was able to open the
[41:16] book neither to look
[41:21] their and I
[41:24] responded what is John responding
[41:31] may God
[41:33] grant more
[41:35] joh who see and
[41:39] respond when John went to
[41:42] Athens he
[41:44] idat and he
[41:47] responded when John went to heaven he
[41:50] saw
[41:52] invitation and discovered there was no
[41:54] man Worthy he responded and we see
[41:58] people in the
[41:59] church as ha as they can
[42:06] be shame on
[42:11] brother is not the type of the
[42:14] scripture what he saw when when he
[42:20] good he responds
[42:22] good when he bad he responds
[42:27] bad but not
[42:30] IND these are not
[42:33] customers who up for bread as long as
[42:36] they have their money for bread bring it
[42:39] to me here is your
[42:42] bread are the pies of the blood of Jesus
[42:50] Christ so when there was no man
[42:55] found
[42:57] I wept
[43:03] much what was that verse five verse four
[43:06] I wept
[43:08] much because no man was able to open the
[43:14] book and one of the ERS said to
[43:17] me you are correct in
[43:20] Weeping that's not the situation on the
[43:25] ground the real matter is the lion of
[43:29] the tribe of
[43:31] Judah has prevailed to take the
[43:35] book and lose the seals
[43:38] there so even though I cry when I see
[43:42] something I hope there is this elder
[43:46] somewhere who tells me don't
[43:50] weep the solution is in
[43:54] place that's not theight final position
[43:56] of that
[43:58] girl the final of that
[44:02] boy
[44:04] don't the girl is going to
[44:07] sort don't we the boy is going to sort
[44:11] himself
[44:12] out don't we the Believers are going to
[44:16] be message
[44:18] Believers what I see call upon a weeping
[44:24] time knows is watch in the heart that
[44:29] person is a Hollywood
[44:31] look she is the best believer we
[44:37] have we have is
[44:41] this when you look at her you can
[44:46] weep six
[44:48] husbands what a bad
[44:51] story when you look at RAB you are
[44:54] supposed to weep
[44:57] what a terrible shape the woman is
[45:00] in Mr spy she is the best I
[45:05] have in
[45:07] Jero I am not weeping I know God has
[45:11] never left himself without a
[45:17] witness let's
[45:19] pray gracious
[45:22] God help me Lord to be sensitive to your
[45:26] Holy
[45:28] Spirit and say nothing out of arrogance
[45:31] or Pride or
[45:35] hypocrisy Min the Holy Ghost need of the
[45:41] believer what's in their heart what
[45:44] their cry is and you know the
[45:48] answer one time you said to
[45:51] Philip give these people food and he
[45:54] says we don't have enough
[45:56] money to service these people with
[45:59] bread but Jesus knew what he was going
[46:02] to
[46:03] do so we realize when we
[46:06] preach though we speak of solutions but
[46:08] we have
[46:10] none Jesus himself knows what he's going
[46:13] to
[46:13] do we don't have to fight for anything
[46:16] or protect
[46:17] anything but we just surrender to him to
[46:21] say thy will be
[46:23] done in the name of the Lord Jesus
[46:25] Christ
[46:27] please
[46:34] seated I'm going to just do a little

[55:22] idea come my brother you
[55:47] thank you where about God bless you so
[55:51] now I'm going to say
[55:54] something
[55:56] I'm
[55:58] sorry I don't know what I'm doing
[56:02] wrong I can change this position
[56:06] somewhere in my
[56:08] jacket and see whether will have
[56:14] peace I saw in the right hand of him
[56:17] that set on the
[56:19] throne a book written within and
[56:23] without Seven
[56:26] Seals and the Seven
[56:29] Seals have seal number
[56:32] one seal number
[56:35] two seal number
[56:38] three four five
[56:43] 6
[56:45] and as a
[56:48] Believer you need to know what the first
[56:50] seal
[56:53] is but if
[56:55] your ABCs are not
[57:00] correct you will write the
[57:10] wrong let me put it this
[57:12] way I hope it's acceptable
[57:15] brother let me put it this way of the
[57:20] answers I
[57:23] got let me
[57:26] say there was a wrong answer
[57:40] somewhere brother you didn't even greet
[57:43] [Music]
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:46] me what if this was an excuse for me to
[57:49] give you a
[57:52] handshake so you better come back for
[57:54] your handshake
[58:12] where is
[58:15] yours right WR it
[58:19] here give us give us a
[58:23] pen
[58:26] come
[58:31] around you can give him the
[58:36] pen then give me the
[58:39] handshake now you can
[58:45] go is is there one of the pastors who
[58:48] want me to announce their answer to the
[58:51] church or you want me to keep it a
[58:53] secret
[58:58] is your hand
[59:01] up oh he a
[59:05] cameraman so did you notice the pastors
[59:08] don't want me to announce he got it
[59:10] right he got it WR he got it
[59:13] wrong
[59:15] also it won't be right for me to do
[59:20] that
[59:22] but it's also right for
[59:26] me to tell you that some of them got it
[59:33] wrong now that's very
[59:37] difficult very
[59:41] difficult because what it means
[59:44] is although I am asking about the first
[59:48] seal I'm also asking where they stand
[59:52] with the ABCs
[1:00:02] if it's not
[1:00:04] correct the first seal will be
[1:00:10] wrong but the word Pastor is not going
[1:00:13] to be
[1:00:16] negotiated this man remains a
[1:00:19] pastor even though he doesn't see the
[1:00:23] f because the word Pastor is what I live
[1:00:27] by the word Pastor the name Pastor is
[1:00:30] what I live by that's my
[1:00:34] job so if the first
[1:00:38] seal and indeed if none of the seals are
[1:00:45] revealed it means this
[1:00:47] book is still
[1:00:50] sealed if this book is
[1:00:53] sealed there is response must
[1:00:56] be
[1:01:01] crying you cannot celebrate when the
[1:01:04] book has failed to be
[1:01:09] opened no you can't
[1:01:13] celebrate celebration is when the book
[1:01:17] is number one taken number
[1:01:22] two you can celebrate
[1:01:26] I am standing here and the first seal is
[1:01:30] closed to
[1:01:32] me you have no
[1:01:37] cration somebody say Amen somewhere
[1:01:41] let's Cate there's no
[1:01:45] celebration the seal is not
[1:01:48] open it's time to
[1:01:51] [Applause]
[1:01:53] cry
[1:01:55] so I wept
[1:01:57] much can you put it
[1:02:03] back verse four I wept
[1:02:09] much if you hear that there is a pastor
[1:02:12] who didn't know what the first seal was
[1:02:16] here all our celebration must
[1:02:21] stop it's time to
[1:02:23] weep
[1:02:26] Uganda Uganda time to
[1:02:32] weep but I'm not going to tell you who
[1:02:35] was who and who was
[1:02:37] who God was watching it and the
[1:02:40] scripture is also there looking at you
[1:02:44] it saw your answer was wrong it saw the
[1:02:47] seal was not open to
[1:02:49] you and because it was not open if I am
[1:02:54] Jo
[1:02:55] I must
[1:03:01] wh why the brother doesn't know the
[1:03:06] F that's a major
[1:03:13] eventer that's ajor
[1:03:17] event the
[1:03:19] solution in
[1:03:23] verse the lion of the tribe of
[1:03:26] Judah opened
[1:03:30] it and this is how it
[1:03:34] happened in the midst of the
[1:03:38] throne and of the four
[1:03:40] beasts and in the midst of the
[1:03:43] elders stood a
[1:03:45] lamb as it had been
[1:03:48] slain having seven
[1:03:51] horns and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:03:55] spirits of
[1:03:57] God and the lamb came and took the
[1:04:01] [Applause]
[1:04:03] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:04:05] set on the
[1:04:08] throne when he had taken the
[1:04:12] book The Four
[1:04:16] beasts and the 24
[1:04:19] Elders fell down before the
[1:04:22] left to break the success of the
[1:04:26] Lamb fell down to
[1:04:29] worship has not joined in
[1:04:32] yet but in heaven the beasts are
[1:04:38] ecstatic the 24 Elders are
[1:04:42] celebrating John is
[1:04:44] watching and then when he
[1:04:48] saw
[1:04:50] uh the lamb being woried by the beasts
[1:04:55] and the 24
[1:04:58] Elders presenting the orders which are
[1:05:02] the prayers of the
[1:05:05] Saints first n says they sang a new
[1:05:11] song singing is entertainment if the

[1:10:22] brother says I in
[1:10:25] English that means head me
[1:10:29] saying the one who was head saying
[1:10:31] blessing and honor and glory and
[1:10:40] Power in English without a
[1:10:43] revelation it's like John hear somebody
[1:10:50] saying but according to the prophet
[1:10:54] the one who is saying blessing and glory
[1:10:56] and honor and
[1:10:58] [Applause]
[1:11:01] power is I I
[1:11:05] who but the one who is saying these
[1:11:09] things was the one who was
[1:11:11] weeping so the one who has not paid
[1:11:15] attention to the
[1:11:22] ABCs
[1:11:24] you have nothing to
[1:11:26] celebrate then when the Revelation
[1:11:28] strikes you have sorted out the
[1:11:33] ABCs
[1:11:35] your to change from weeping
[1:11:39] mode to Celebration
[1:11:42] mode but we have people who should be
[1:11:46] crying we see
[1:11:49] C you hold the
[1:11:52] mic the form and they
[1:11:55] celebrate and they know nothing I'm not

[1:13:32] Antichrist is Antichrist God or the
[1:13:39] devil are you listening to
[1:13:41] me I've run out of

[1:13:48] Antichrist Jesus Christ I want you to
[1:13:51] answer me yes or
[1:13:56] no they angry they not
[1:14:00] answering I will ask again I want you to
[1:14:04] answer so I can hear you is the
[1:14:09] Antichrist the white hor
[1:14:11] Rider is that Jesus
[1:14:14] Christ or is the
[1:14:18] devil thank
[1:14:20] you
[1:14:22] now
[1:14:24] somebody wrot first seal is the white
[1:14:28] horse rider the
[1:14:32] Antichrist that would mean the first
[1:14:36] seal is the
[1:14:38] devil the question was what is the
[1:14:43] first are you with me
[1:14:46] pastors what is the first seal and you
[1:14:50] wrote maybe I have to choose my way
[1:14:53] properly I'm stepping on Dangerous
[1:14:55] Ground
[1:14:57] here if you wrote White
[1:15:02] was
[1:15:04] Antichrist you are telling me the first
[1:15:09] seal is the
[1:15:12] devil do you understand
[1:15:16] that now I want somebody to show some
[1:15:20] life I'm pushy this afternoon
[1:15:25] let me push hard so don't just be
[1:15:28] quiet iard man I was working
[1:15:32] with whatever you say is what he was
[1:15:39] thinking if you say this is
[1:15:43] e yes if you come back you say no I
[1:15:47] found out this is
[1:15:50] East that's what I was
[1:15:52] saying
[1:15:54] I
[1:15:55] say you saying is there now is there and
[1:15:59] you're saying that's what I was saying
[1:16:01] so whatever you say that's what you are
[1:16:04] saying so whatever I tell you is the
[1:16:07] right answer is what you will
[1:16:10] saying I want to make it
[1:16:15] tight are you with me Pastor I want to
[1:16:18] make it
[1:16:19] tight I want to say this because because
[1:16:23] I don't have
[1:16:24] time if you wrot the first seal is the
[1:16:31] Antichrist you are saying the first seal
[1:16:34] is the
[1:16:35] devil and if you say the first seal is
[1:16:38] the
[1:16:39] devil then yours are not
[1:16:46] refilled are you following my
[1:16:50] argument and if the first seal is not
[1:16:54] revealed and you're calling the faceal
[1:16:57] the
[1:16:58] devil it means there's something that
[1:17:00] caused
[1:17:02] it for you not to
[1:17:04] know what the is because the face seal
[1:17:08] is not the
[1:17:11] dev and I'm going to read one
[1:17:14] quotation because I'm racing After
[1:17:22] Time looking for it
[1:17:24] first I didn't have good notes for
[1:17:47] this I am not getting
[1:17:52] it
[1:17:58] I'm trying
[1:18:09] again I'm trying again the third
[1:18:15] time yes can you open this
[1:18:21] statement
[1:18:27] what is the opening of seals
[1:18:30] then what is the opening of seals
[1:18:43] then is it there yeah come down
[1:18:51] 308 308
[1:18:55] 8 yes thank you there is
[1:19:00] 308 we are talking about Jesus Christ
[1:19:02] pastors
[1:19:07] Church those who don't obey in these
[1:19:12] little
[1:19:13] things will miss
[1:19:16] it in these other things which are the
[1:19:19] other things the
[1:19:21] seals if you got it wrong it means there
[1:19:26] is little things you are stepping
[1:19:29] over causing you not to get these
[1:19:33] things so what are the Seals and if I
[1:19:36] say it you can go and repeat it doesn't
[1:19:39] mean it's
[1:19:42] revealed but at least you can repeat
[1:19:46] it is the one who open the
[1:19:49] seals so let's ask a few questions who
[1:19:52] open the
[1:19:54] seal Jesus Christ all right and when he
[1:19:59] opened what came
[1:20:01] out the
[1:20:02] devil but my question was what is the
[1:20:08] F so let's read
[1:20:11] on please underline you have covered my
[1:20:15] my
[1:20:18] quotation I had read this one he is the
[1:20:20] one who opened the seals I was going to
[1:20:22] the next line
[1:20:26] yeah no that
[1:20:28] line he
[1:20:33] is something else is happening but I
[1:20:35] want line
[1:20:37] number that one I've read so thank you
[1:20:41] very much now the next one is what I
[1:20:43] want you to
[1:20:45] highlight thank you
[1:20:47] there
[1:20:50] that I want the church to see that
[1:20:54] Church let's read this
[1:20:57] together he is those seals
[1:21:03] who Christ is the devil the
[1:21:06] seals no and if you say the first is
[1:21:09] Antichrist are you correct or are you
[1:21:15] wrong
[1:21:17] and what closed your
[1:21:21] sight
[1:21:23] so go back to the drawing
[1:21:25] board fix up
[1:21:28] there if yours is fine like this and
[1:21:31] your wife is not you are to
[1:21:38] blame the brothers are not saying
[1:21:41] amen if you have a
[1:21:46] ha the one who is being blamed is the
[1:21:51] man
[1:21:54] if the ABC is about hair and shoes and
[1:21:57] things
[1:21:59] where like the pastor say at the end of
[1:22:01] the
[1:22:03] service why would you want to cut your
[1:22:05] dress on the side fashion what is
[1:22:09] fashion the
[1:22:11] Bible Bible says dress up so if those
[1:22:15] things are not in place then I'll will
[1:22:18] ask your husband what is the
[1:22:21] first
[1:22:23] maybe I'll ask your pastor what is the
[1:22:25] first thing he may know what is blocking
[1:22:29] him the
[1:22:33] ab that's how important those things
[1:22:37] are can you say
[1:22:40] Amen so he who Jesus is those seal so
[1:22:48] what is the first
[1:22:51] seal
[1:22:53] somebody wrote that but they said first
[1:22:56] is the word don't know what they meant
[1:22:59] but there it
[1:23:02] is the seals is Christ the seals is the
[1:23:06] word and Christ is the
[1:23:09] word go to the next Skip One phrase go
[1:23:15] to the next phrase fast this time after
[1:23:19] where you were highlighting you skip
[1:23:20] that phrase go to the next one and no
[1:23:24] above
[1:23:26] above after the word
[1:23:29] Christ the phrase starts after
[1:23:36] the No No I want from
[1:23:39] end I must be strict with you
[1:23:43] sir ahuh now we are
[1:23:46] there does it matter no it doesn't those
[1:23:49] are the little things I'm talking
[1:23:51] about
[1:23:53] he must get it right
[1:23:55] there and then he will be a candidate
[1:23:57] for the
[1:24:05] festival and Christ you didn't finish
[1:24:07] this the phrase phras is from one break
[1:24:11] to the next
[1:24:12] break so starting there
[1:24:15] no Christ as the Ser car on until the
[1:24:19] end of the
[1:24:20] phrase thank you now let's read it
[1:24:23] together I'm just doing it so the church
[1:24:25] is with
[1:24:27] me chch read with
[1:24:29] me and Christ is the seals that was
[1:24:39] opened the first seal is the first seal
[1:24:43] of the seals that was
[1:24:46] opened and who is the
[1:24:50] first Christ who is the second
[1:24:54] seal who is the third
[1:24:57] seal who is the fourth
[1:25:00] seal so what go to the next one which is
[1:25:03] in blue and highlight the whole
[1:25:07] phrase that one and the
[1:25:13] next now let's read it
[1:25:16] together I got five minutes so I'm just
[1:25:19] about
[1:25:21] to
[1:25:24] what is the opening of the seals
[1:25:27] then answer for
[1:25:33] me so there's something
[1:25:37] wrong with reading the book of the
[1:25:41] seals and seeing the first seal as the
[1:25:44] white horse
[1:25:46] rider if I say that statement you should
[1:25:50] have a revelation on it
[1:25:53] not repeat it without knowing what you
[1:25:55] are saying so the
[1:25:57] f is not the white hor rer the second
[1:26:01] seal is not the red horse rider the
[1:26:05] third seal is not the black horse rider
[1:26:09] these rers are in a serious
[1:26:14] provision where Christ is being
[1:26:18] revealed there is something else you see
[1:26:24] but seeing it doesn't make it part of
[1:26:27] the
[1:26:29] program if you go to Uganda and you go
[1:26:33] to Ginger and you see this man there you
[1:26:36] have not seen a
[1:26:39] Ugandan you just seen a man in
[1:26:42] Uganda but he not
[1:26:45] ug I don't have a birth
[1:26:47] certificate don't have an
[1:26:50] ID uh you call it ID yes I don't have a
[1:26:55] passport but I am in there in Uganda
[1:26:59] Uganda I breathing
[1:27:02] Uganda eating Uganda
[1:27:05] fish eating Uganda
[1:27:07] y I'm preaching to Uganda
[1:27:09] people I am not
[1:27:14] Uganda so if you forced to call me a
[1:27:17] Ugandan just because you sported me
[1:27:21] G
[1:27:24] and if you see a white rer when the f is
[1:27:28] being revealed and you call that Christ
[1:27:30] you are
[1:27:32] wrong it's there where Christ is being
[1:27:36] revealed but it's not
[1:27:39] the for you who want to stud further if
[1:27:42] you open re Genesis 1 there was a garden
[1:27:48] there in the garden was Jesus Christ
[1:27:52] but in the same Garden was another tree
[1:27:56] but that other tree was not the tree
[1:27:59] where we eat
[1:28:02] from is forbidden to eat from that
[1:28:06] tree and when you look at the seals and
[1:28:09] you see white the Holy Ghost if other
[1:28:14] things are in
[1:28:15] place tell you that is not
[1:28:21] Jesus
[1:28:22] that is the
[1:28:23] Antichrist and the thing I want to close
[1:28:28] with when the seals are
[1:28:31] revealed you are getting a discharge of
[1:28:37] power because the revelation of the
[1:28:41] seals have to do with the
[1:28:44] church and the church the Gate of Hell
[1:28:49] shall not
[1:28:51] prevail
[1:28:52] and when you get a
[1:28:54] revelation you're getting the power to
[1:28:58] overcome the gates
[1:28:59] of and when there's no
[1:29:02] Revelation your life will be marked by
[1:29:05] lack of
[1:29:08] power to
[1:29:10] overcome what God wants
[1:29:13] overcome and the Revelation carries the
[1:29:17] power so I feel to read one last
[1:29:21] quotation I think I'm still okay with my
[1:29:23] time I got two more minutes until qu 2
[1:29:28] and 16 minutes until
[1:29:32] 5:00 I'm going to seek for
[1:29:36] this
[1:29:48] quotation I don't know where to get it
[1:29:51] but I'll find it
[1:29:54] oh
[1:30:01] my okay I think I am too far away
[1:30:15] there uh I'm going to look for it it's
[1:30:17] in the fifth seal I must read
[1:30:20] it
[1:30:22] because I will not be happy if I
[1:30:26] can't
[1:30:27] okay so let's go to the fifth
[1:30:32] seal F seal and I'm going
[1:30:36] to type in
[1:30:45] Power
[1:30:47] released you found it
[1:30:50] okay
[1:31:04] yeah I got it
[1:31:07] def you already open the fifth seal go
[1:31:11] to paragraph 140 our paragraphs are the
[1:31:16] same
[1:31:18] okay don't forget this church
[1:31:30] and you Brethren on tape you got
[1:31:35] it let's go to this is now paragraph
[1:31:41] 140 but yours is not showing so where it
[1:31:44] says don't is paragraph
[1:31:49] 14 and don't forget
[1:31:52] get before that end is now paragraph
[1:32:01] 140 I'm going to be very basic
[1:32:05] Now read after
[1:32:07] me don't forget this
[1:32:11] church give them a chance to say it okay
[1:32:14] I'll start again don't forget this
[1:32:20] church and you Brethren on
[1:32:29] tape I want you to examine
[1:32:36] this how could men do anything
[1:32:44] else besides the power of God that was
[1:32:48] released to
[1:32:50] them the
[1:32:56] so the first
[1:32:57] seal is talking about the victory of the
[1:33:02] church granted by
[1:33:06] Jesus in
[1:33:08] the he releases a power and that power
[1:33:13] is what the church lives by but if that
[1:33:16] church has not done the
[1:33:19] ABC he doesn't reveal
[1:33:22] what they need to overc so they will be
[1:33:26] a
[1:33:28] defeated you go to the
[1:33:30] second God releases a power overcomes
[1:33:34] the
[1:33:37] threats and without that
[1:33:40] Revelation the threat overwhelms
[1:33:44] you you run after the
[1:33:47] enemy thinking you running after Christ
[1:33:52] so now people stand before
[1:33:55] people say
[1:33:57] receive receive if you want money
[1:34:00] receive what are you chasing money what
[1:34:04] are you chasing the wrong
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:11] Rider but Christ has released the
[1:34:15] power that makes the True Believer
[1:34:19] overcome first of all he overcomes by
[1:34:22] obeying instructions about the
[1:34:26] hell then God P his
[1:34:29] anointing of the age to make them see
[1:34:34] it's
[1:34:36] wrong so what John had happening to
[1:34:42] him the thing that John had which
[1:34:45] happened to
[1:34:48] him was this when the first
[1:34:52] open he saw
[1:34:55] Christ I won't prove that this afternoon
[1:34:58] when he saw Christ he
[1:35:01] also
[1:35:03] saw where the enemy
[1:35:07] was and if you are there in that
[1:35:11] time and you see the enemy but calling
[1:35:17] Christ you will be like
[1:35:20] if sees the
[1:35:22] serpent calls a
[1:35:24] [Applause]
[1:35:26] husband it's the wrong
[1:35:29] person to have a baby
[1:35:32] with you know about the
[1:35:36] seity she mistook the identity of this
[1:35:44] Rider believed this Rider followed this
[1:35:49] Rider and was destroyed by
[1:35:53] and if you call the white horse rider
[1:35:56] Christ you follow that Rider he will
[1:36:00] deceive you he will destroy
[1:36:03] you and then your
[1:36:05] crying becomes ped crying as
[1:36:12] well amen I want to
[1:36:18] read There are some clouds so I'm
[1:36:20] failing to land
[1:36:24] the wind is too
[1:36:26] fast so I'm doing another Short
[1:36:38] Round do me a favor put Revelations 3
[1:36:42] ver4 to
[1:36:50] 20

[1:37:05] Church of
[1:37:06] laia

[1:37:18] works and I complain about them so no
[1:37:21] pra

[1:37:33] say I am
[1:37:35] rich and increased
[1:37:39] in I have need
[1:37:42] of that Prosperity
[1:37:45] Gospel is being preached by loud here
[1:37:49] because they don't see the deception
[1:37:51] that is in
[1:37:52] it and because they don't see
[1:37:55] that they boast
[1:37:58] money I don't go back there we dealt
[1:38:01] with it
[1:38:04] yesterday but while they boasting

[1:38:08] riched they're
[1:38:10] miserable they're blind they're poor
[1:38:13] they're
[1:38:14] naked that's the spirit that's
[1:38:18] catching us we are not awake
[1:38:24] and the
[1:38:26] prophet says real things and Lasting
[1:38:29] things come from God without
[1:38:34] money and this loud is
[1:38:39] here
[1:38:42] is please open how can I

[1:44:02] in I have quotations here which says
[1:44:07] riches saying I am rich uses the spirit
[1:44:11] of
[1:44:13] deception so the spirit of deception is
[1:44:15] the white hor
[1:44:17] Rider now there is the white
[1:44:22] and the red and the black all in
[1:44:28] one to try and catch the last day

[1:44:58] in the red in
[1:45:02] Philadelphia the black and
[1:45:05] in the three
[1:45:10] together so a little deception withes a
[1:45:14] little

[1:47:38] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:47:40] Christ take your
[1:47:44] seat over to the
[1:47:49] pastor
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:53] you still want your

[1:48:08] [Music]
[1:48:11] pen God bless
[1:48:13] you you appreciated the service your
[1:48:18] service Christ was the
[1:48:20] [Applause]
[1:48:22] that was
[1:48:23] revealed and actually he
[1:48:27] revealed and the
[1:48:29] Revelation was he was revealing
[1:48:33] himself so when you look at all those
[1:48:36] you know
[1:48:38] seals there was always one who was
[1:48:41] always saying come and
[1:48:43] see that's the power that was
[1:48:47] preparing the remnant of that age
[1:48:52] to over the negative
[1:48:55] rer in every age so Christ is those
[1:48:59] seals that was
[1:49:01] revealed and he was releasing power to
[1:49:06] overcome everything that the enemy was
[1:49:09] releasing to fight in every
[1:49:12] age even
[1:49:14] inia he released the wealth he released
[1:49:17] Pride he released everything
[1:49:20] but you see right there again is a
[1:49:23] flying ego
[1:49:25] anointing the anointing that will help
[1:49:29] you to prophetically detect all the sles
[1:49:33] of the
[1:49:36] enemy and once you depend on him his
[1:49:40] power is present to help you
[1:49:44] overcome amen so we can be tempted tried
[1:49:52] but the power to overcome is always
[1:49:55] released so the first thing he does is
[1:49:59] to say come and see learn the tricks of
[1:50:02] the
[1:50:03] enemy he wants make you know that is
[1:50:07] there with you so Christ was those seals
[1:50:10] and everything that was being
[1:50:13] revealed in the seals was Christ
[1:50:17] revealing himself amen as they a present
