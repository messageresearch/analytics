[45:24] church
[45:27] yeah this past year 2023 has been so
[45:30] wonderful for

[45:35] fruits in our
[45:38] country many have come to the knowledge
[45:40] of the
[45:42] message we only in
[45:46] 2023 we were able to bapti over 80
[45:54] Souls
[45:57] yeah 80 Souls I know when it comes to
[46:00] Uganda it's a small I know
[46:02] it but for
[46:04] Ethiopia if a single person believes
[46:08] it's like the whole nation has
[46:10] believed because is a very strong
[46:13] country when it comes to
[46:16] religion actually Ethiopians
[46:20] believe never believe that they are
[46:23] Africans although they are Africans
[46:26] they say we are not Africans but we live
[46:28] in
[46:30] Africa hallelujah hallelujah but we know
[46:33] that we are all
[46:34] Africans and I'm so grateful today I
[46:38] came with my
[46:39] wife sister
[46:42] Mery and our boy
[46:46] babyi baby
[46:47] Levi and are here with
[46:50] you and we welcome
[46:53] them amen
[46:56] and
[46:57] today I just want to speak something
[47:00] small that has been in my
[47:02] heart just to share with you I know your
[47:06] Elder Minister and the
[47:07] rest will take you deeper into the
[47:10] words we just here actually I came maybe
[47:15] to
[47:16] visit not really to preach it is the
[47:20] time that we need the ministry of the
[47:21] pastor more than
[47:24] hours so so when I was told to
[47:29] preach something came to my mind my
[47:32] heart and I fa to read the
[47:35] scriptures and as a
[47:37] subject I was thinking that a reward for
[47:43] service reward for
[47:47] service reward for
[47:49] service because the Bible told us that
[47:53] everyone may
[47:54] receive things done in this
[47:57] body according to that he had
[48:00] done whether it is good or
[48:03] bad amen amen there is a reward for a
[48:08] service there is a reward for whatever
[48:11] we
[48:12] do and we know we serve a living
[48:15] God our God is not dead
[48:18] God our God is a living God how many
[48:22] believe that our God is a living
[48:24] God God is a living God and we Ser a
[48:28] living God and we thank we thank God for
[48:32] the message of the
[48:33] hour that he gave us this
[48:36] message for us to be drawn very close to
[48:40] God this message brought us Clos to God
[48:44] for us to have a clo
[48:48] walk just like David would say my soul T
[48:52] is for
[48:54] thee we are tting of
[48:56] God every day and every morning we are
[49:00] thiry of God young children young
[49:04] Brethren and
[49:05] sisters and brothers this is not just a
[49:09] family a family
[49:12] religion this is life and
[49:14] days God called us to
[49:17] himself because he loved us before the
[49:20] foundation of the
[49:22] world hallelujah hallelujah we are to
[49:26] him himself because our God is not a God
[49:31] who can only work
[49:33] yesterday actually the prophet would say
[49:37] what good is
[49:38] it if our God who did things in the past
[49:44] is not the same in this
[49:46] time we serve the same
[49:49] God that work things
[49:52] yesterday if God has healed yesterday he
[49:56] will still he today if he has provided
[49:59] yesterday he will still provide today if
[50:03] he has done anything yesterday he can
[50:06] still do it
[50:07] today because we serve a living
[50:10] God and there is a
[50:13] reward for every
[50:16] service hallelujah hallelujah and we are
[50:18] not here by
[50:20] chance by
[50:22] coincidence because our family believes
[50:25] our family members
[50:27] believe we were the seed of God even
[50:31] before this world was
[50:34] founded before the foundation of the
[50:36] world he chose us in
[50:39] him he did not choose
[50:42] other he chose
[50:44] us we are so
[50:47] grateful that he chose us he chose you
[50:51] my sister he chose you my
[50:54] brother amen amen Bible tells us the
[50:59] Bible tells us that we
[51:02] lab to be accepted in
[51:06] him hallelujah hallelujah you know we
[51:09] understand that we are saved by his
[51:11] grace
[51:13] alone but there is something that is
[51:15] expected from
[51:17] us salvation comes only from
[51:20] him but is us to fulfill you know our
[51:25] Closer
[51:27] Walk
[51:28] daily a part that we
[51:31] play in the kingdom of God hallelujah
[51:35] hallelujah there's a part there's a part
[51:39] that I and you can play actually the
[51:43] Bible on this
[51:46] message St and never promised us things
[51:50] to be
[51:52] easier two things to be very normal
[51:56] or everything appearing or everything
[51:59] good no he never promised or he never
[52:03] promised a Bed of
[52:05] Roses could be there could be
[52:07] challenges there could be problems there
[52:10] would be

[52:22] will be with

[52:26] promise he promised to us that I will be
[52:30] with you until the coming of the Lord I
[52:34] just want to encourage you my sister my
[52:37] brother whatever you never form God will
[52:44] reward nobody may not reward

[1:10:34] the deed is in this

[1:10:39] as there is an
[1:10:41] opportunity actually I was so amazed
[1:10:43] when our mom was telling us
[1:10:45] yesterday that there was an
[1:10:47] elder there was an elder who believed
[1:10:51] this
[1:10:52] message when he was 0 90 years
[1:10:55] old in this church and he was always
[1:10:59] wishing and he was always
[1:11:02] wishing and he had the
[1:11:04] opportunity to believe the message when
[1:11:07] he was still
[1:11:08] young you have an
[1:11:12] opportunity you have an
[1:11:14] opportunity my young girl
[1:11:17] sister you have an
[1:11:20] opportunity amen you have a chance
[1:11:25] you have a chance to serve God
[1:11:29] hallelujah hallelujah so that the vers
[1:11:32] that we
[1:11:33] read amen the vers that we read that by
[1:11:40] election by
[1:11:41] election that God calls
[1:11:44] Abraham we know that God calls Abraham
[1:11:47] from his family from his
[1:11:50] tender and brings him to the land that
[1:11:53] he is never knew
[1:11:55] before and he promises him I will

[1:12:02] multiply the of
[1:12:05] Heaven the
[1:12:08] ground my English for you it's okay okay
[1:12:12] so God gives him a
[1:12:14] promise and the promise does not seem
[1:12:16] that happening
[1:12:18] now the prophet would tell us when God
[1:12:21] told him make your fathers of
[1:12:25] nation people used to Mo at
[1:12:29] him
[1:12:34] adversaries mothers and fathers of
[1:12:37] nation but there is nothing
[1:12:41] now Prophet tell us
[1:12:44] that look at this
[1:12:47] man father of
[1:12:51] nation mother of nation
[1:12:54] actually there was
[1:12:56] nothing they were wondering should we go
[1:12:59] back to the
[1:13:02] world but he who he made the
[1:13:06] promise at any time at any point come he
[1:13:12] make it
[1:13:14] pass come to
[1:13:16] [Applause]
[1:13:18] pass is working in the community like
[1:13:21] you he had a promise
[1:13:24] of being father of
[1:13:26] Nations but being mocked
[1:13:30] out being
[1:13:32] mocked but he never
[1:13:34] sted as the
[1:13:37] promises that God has given but by faith
[1:13:42] he knew and believed that God will
[1:13:45] fulfill his
[1:13:52] promises now
[1:13:54] Prophet will
[1:13:56] say that now they
[1:13:59] continued they've carried Theo of that
[1:14:04] decision and I want to tell you
[1:14:08] this to the Young
[1:14:12] Generation
[1:14:16] sah
[1:14:18] reproach for the sake of
[1:14:21] Christ that reproach
[1:14:24] Prophet would
[1:14:26] say she was
[1:14:29] bar it's not like a physical barness
[1:14:31] we're talking about
[1:14:33] here we speaking about spiritual
[1:14:36] matters she was bar she carried the
[1:14:40] reproach of
[1:14:43] barness meaning you carried the reproach
[1:14:46] of deciding to follow
[1:14:50] Jesus they will mock at you
[1:14:54] you are foolish in this 21
[1:14:57] century you are
[1:14:59] foolish when you are supposed to watch
[1:15:02] football when you supposed to go to the
[1:15:06] world walk around around the next of
[1:15:10] God you
[1:15:13] Beck for
[1:15:16] deciding Ser Jesus to live a clean
[1:15:20] life you be more
[1:15:24] but
[1:15:25] sah she carried the reproach of
[1:15:30] barness and now that
[1:15:32] reproach later
[1:15:34] on later on fruit came
[1:15:38] there Prophet would
[1:15:41] say
[1:15:44] first
[1:15:47] then you know
[1:15:50] that it
[1:15:52] out
[1:15:55] fast
[1:15:57] then you can pull it
[1:15:59] out it's in the
[1:16:03] message you can display

[1:16:13] fruit I have it but it's not in my not
[1:16:22] today
[1:16:38] barness
[1:16:52] first
[1:16:55] then

[1:17:02] yes yeah the reproach in that message
[1:17:04] the reproach for the cause of
[1:17:07] Christ can display it for
[1:17:12] them means without
[1:17:16] fruit reproach for the sake of
[1:17:20] Christ then
[1:17:38] yes yeah then now she was
[1:17:42] baren of course physically we don't
[1:17:45] understand that but God has given the
[1:17:48] promise but Prophet would come and
[1:17:51] because you have carried that reproach
[1:17:54] and the fruit comes
[1:17:56] thereof after that now whatever we do
[1:18:00] for the sake of the lord we may be
[1:18:02] mocked at that is a reproach we are
[1:18:07] carrying for the sake of Christ then our
[1:18:10] God because we have stood with

[1:19:14] the reproach of being bar for those
[1:19:18] years to stand all those words all smoke

[1:19:27] promise is
[1:19:29] faithful to come
[1:19:32] and ATO
[1:19:34] time at such time like
[1:19:39] this to some of them to some of us maybe

[1:20:40] expressed is
[1:20:42] work is work is face
[1:20:46] expressed and it
[1:20:49] Compares James and and
[1:20:51] Paul
[1:20:54] people apost
[1:20:56] PA and
[1:20:58] James they speak about the same
[1:21:02] man that
[1:21:05] Isam put
[1:21:08] himam say show me thy
[1:21:12] Work show me thy
[1:21:14] faith without works I'll show
[1:21:18] thee my faith by
[1:21:21] works I mean Paul would
[1:21:25] identify Abraham by Faith by faith
[1:21:31] Abraham believed it was counted right
[1:21:35] unto him you see two of
[1:21:39] themess the same person from the
[1:21:42] different point of
[1:21:44] view amen and Prophet would say the
[1:21:48] Bible being not un contradictory to each
[1:21:51] other
[1:21:53] he puts it right
[1:21:54] now verse 20 of jam say I mean Jam
[1:21:59] chapter
[1:22:00] 2 don't need to go
[1:22:03] there chapter two of
[1:22:06] James verse says faith without works is
[1:22:11] De you see faith without works is De if

[1:22:52] by
[1:22:55] what was was not Abraham our
[1:22:59] father was not Abraham Our Father
[1:23:01] justified by
[1:23:03] works when he had offered Isaac his son
[1:23:06] upon the
[1:23:10] altar now Prophet tell us in that same
[1:23:15] message that James is emphasizing on
[1:23:20] Works watch it very well

[1:24:15] Romans he would say for If Abraham was
[1:24:19] justified by
[1:24:21] works

[1:24:27] AB by what by faith and
[1:24:33] [Music]
[1:24:35] alone yes we are coming to a
[1:24:39] point one is identifying

[1:25:51] laziness
[1:25:54] be very careful there a and you

[1:26:34] appreciate I listen the TS in the house
[1:26:38] I listen the T in my car I listen the in
[1:26:42] the church maybe in the
[1:26:43] morning when it comes to the
[1:26:51] ppit
[1:26:55] yes
[1:26:56] sir these two men Prophet would
[1:27:00] say are talking the same these two
[1:27:03] men he say they are speaking about
[1:27:07] faith now PA is justifying Abraham by
[1:27:11] what in
[1:27:14] him list said
[1:27:17] very watch
[1:27:20] me Paul
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:25] is
[1:27:27] explaining or
[1:27:32] defy by what God saw in
[1:27:37] abam by what by what God saw in
[1:27:45] abrahames is defining I mean
[1:27:49] Abraham by The Works men saw in
[1:27:58] are are we
[1:28:02] together catch it very well now
[1:28:06] PA is justifying
[1:28:10] Abraham by what God
[1:28:12] himself so in I mean in
[1:28:16] Abraham Abraham believed in
[1:28:19] God and it was counted right
[1:28:23] him
[1:28:25] and is
[1:28:28] justifying by what God saw in
[1:28:32] Abraham but now PA is
[1:28:38] justifying by what men saw in
[1:28:42] AB that why show me th
[1:28:47] works if you say I have favor show me my
[1:28:51] works
[1:28:53] what Abraham did on
[1:28:56] Mah people saw his face
[1:29:00] in if we say we believe in God we need
[1:29:03] to show people that we believe in
[1:29:10] [Applause]
[1:29:13] God
[1:29:16] Amen people that we live with they need
[1:29:20] to see
[1:29:22] they need to
[1:29:24] see your faith expressed in
[1:29:37] action but PA is
[1:29:41] defining
[1:29:44] justifying not by what people saw he's
[1:29:48] defining him only by what God
[1:29:50] saw
[1:29:57] but
[1:29:58] James you see Bible tells
[1:30:02] us tell us you are
[1:30:05] Epistles of all
[1:30:10] men we are Christ walking on
[1:30:14] Earth we
[1:30:16] are people see us people need to see our
[1:30:21] fa
[1:30:22] expressed by
[1:30:27] works and that work that work is
[1:30:32] expressed in this
[1:30:34] flesh and if you do it there is a reward
[1:30:44] for
[1:30:47] amen so Abraham believed
[1:30:50] God
[1:30:54] what God saw in
[1:30:55] him he believed
[1:30:57] it but when he went
[1:31:01] acting it is
[1:31:03] done that is what man saw in
[1:31:09] him do we have Christians
[1:31:12] today who can say Amen to
[1:31:15] this the same thing with
[1:31:17] us our works expresses what faith we
[1:31:20] have
[1:31:23] whether we are
[1:31:25] weak that's why Prophet would come and
[1:31:28] tell us we need to take out this wish
[1:31:32] wish born
[1:31:34] out wish wish born wish
[1:31:44] we and we put on

[1:32:01] revelation you see it is revealed to you
[1:32:05] and that Revelation is
[1:32:08] given
[1:32:09] only to the
[1:32:12] El re reation is not for everybody
[1:32:18] Revelation is for the
[1:32:20] El
[1:32:28] Bible tells us a prophet will tell us
[1:32:32] that the Church of the Living God is
[1:32:35] built on
[1:32:39] Revelation on the Revelation that on the
[1:32:41] face of I mean on the faith that it is
[1:32:45] revealed to
[1:32:47] you tell in Matthew
[1:32:50] 16 called that I

[1:32:56] call you the so some would call you a
[1:32:59] miracle worker Miracle
[1:33:04] work one of the
[1:33:06] prophets but who do you call me now
[1:33:09] Jesus asking the
[1:33:11] disciples
[1:33:12] and Son of
[1:33:16] Jonah and you tell him th Jesus son of
[1:33:22] the Living
[1:33:23] God

[1:33:55] church and the of the
[1:33:58] enemy not

[1:34:03] Revelation is not to be overcome by the
[1:34:10] dev what makes you stand on the
[1:34:13] message the revelation of what you are
[1:34:17] in
[1:34:20] Christ
[1:34:26] that
[1:34:27] Revelation proph say how that Baptist
[1:34:30] Minister would come to
[1:34:33] him and he doesn't like he doesn't

[1:35:09] it is the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:35:13] is the church is
[1:35:15] buil on the
[1:35:17] revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you
[1:35:23] so this church is established on the
[1:35:27] understanding on the
[1:35:29] Revelation who Jesus Christ
[1:35:39] is amen
[1:35:44] am Prophet would
[1:35:47] say how Revelation is very very
[1:35:50] important
[1:35:53] how God has been very
[1:35:56] sensitive on how to keep this
[1:35:59] Revelation or to keep this
[1:36:01] gift this Revelation to the I mean to
[1:36:04] the to the to the
[1:36:06] bride would come and tell us that
[1:36:09] message that how the Revelation is come
[1:36:11] to me given to

[1:36:16] another
[1:36:17] lady astronauts coming asking him on
[1:36:20] that he was born on
[1:36:23] sign but now that same message Prophet
[1:36:27] would say he many times would love would
[1:36:30] have killed
[1:36:32] himself he wanted to kill himself he
[1:36:35] even wanted to shoot
[1:36:37] himself but he could not he said God is
[1:36:42] protecting the
[1:36:44] gift meaning God is protecting the
[1:36:46] Revelation for the
[1:36:50] bride
[1:36:55] God is so
[1:36:57] sensitive God has been so
[1:37:01] protective for that
[1:37:04] Revelation that came from him to be
[1:37:09] protected until it reaches
[1:37:11] home so God didn't
[1:37:14] want Prophet to die carrying that gift
[1:37:19] carrying that revelation you see how
[1:37:22] important Revelation
[1:37:27] is he says one day I wanted to kill
[1:37:33] myself to take my own
[1:37:35] life he said the gun wouldn't go
[1:37:39] off and God took care of the
[1:37:42] gift what is that gift the
[1:37:48] reation denominations would say the gift
[1:37:51] of healing the gift of this and this and
[1:37:54] that but God was so
[1:37:56] careful he had you in
[1:37:59] mind this
[1:38:01] Revelation that is going to come through
[1:38:03] the
[1:38:04] prophet wouldn't you wouldn't miss it he
[1:38:08] had to make sure that it reach
[1:38:10] home so your
[1:38:13] fa on
[1:38:20] Revelation
[1:38:23] amen whenever God does anything in that
[1:38:27] message Prophet would say whenever God
[1:38:30] does anything he declared it in
[1:38:33] heaven whatever he declares it in heaven
[1:38:37] he brings it through his
[1:38:39] T the bride
[1:38:42] now what he declared it in heaven God
[1:38:45] gave it to the prophets that Revelation
[1:38:49] that restoration message God stored it
[1:38:52] in
[1:38:54] himing God stored it in

[1:43:56] Resurrection before he was even
[1:43:59] born it was revealed to
[1:44:03] them so they
[1:44:05] walked

[2:04:00] instantly God chooses
