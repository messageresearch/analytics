[19:07] Oh [music and singing] glorious

[19:11] Amen. Praise the name of our Lord.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; We thank God. We serve a living God.
[19:18] Praise the name of our Lord.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for this afternoon.
[19:26] the grace that you've given up us to
[19:28] come into your presence.
[19:31] You said where two or three are gathered
[19:33] in your name,
[19:35] you will be there in their midst.
[19:38] And we believe Lord, you are here, Lord.
[19:41] Speak to us again.
[19:44] We also pray you may hear our prayers.
[19:47] We appreciate for the service we had in
[19:49] the morning.
[19:50] We pray that again may be with us this
[19:53] afternoon.
[19:55] all other brothers and sisters into your
[19:57] hands
[19:59] to be part of this service.
[20:02] Remember sister was traveling to
[20:07] and even others in different brother
[20:09] going back because of ill health
[20:15] over them heavenly
[20:17] watch over us all together for the grow
[20:20] of your holy name in the name of the
[20:22] Lord Jesus grant us peace
[20:25] Amen. Amen.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Let us go to Romans chapter 12.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; We're reading from verse one verse two.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Romans 12 verse one verse 2.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[20:50] &gt;&gt; "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
[20:54] the mercies of God that you present your
[20:57] bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[21:01] acceptable unto God, which is your
[21:04] reasonable service.
[21:21] and be not conformed to this world, but
[21:24] be ye transformed by the renewing of
[21:27] your mind, that you may prove what is
[21:30] that good and acceptable and perfect
[21:34] will of God.
[21:52] May God sing of his word.
[21:55] Be seated.
[21:58] So I want to preach on the acceptable
[22:00] sacrifice.
[22:04] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[22:07] says
[22:08] &gt;&gt; that we offer our bodies
[22:12] as a living sacrifice
[22:17] acceptable to God.
[22:20] And then he says that is our reasonable
[22:23] service.
[22:27] Now a sacrifice
[22:29] like we would look in the Old Testament
[22:33] they used to offer animals.
[22:37] as their sacrifices,
[22:39] you know, and then they had various
[22:41] forms of sacrifices,
[22:45] you know, they had sin offerings,
[22:48] peace offering,
[22:51] Christmas offering.
[22:53] But then all these sacrifices
[22:56] were all a shadow of Christ.
[23:00] You know, they were all pointing us to
[23:02] Christ.
[23:05] Now the Bible says we are living at the
[23:08] time when already Christ has fulfilled
[23:11] all these shadows in the Old Testament.
[23:17] Praise the name of our Lord where they
[23:19] would offer those sacrifices
[23:22] and now it comes to us
[23:25] that we in the Old Testament
[23:28] they were offering those sacrifices of
[23:30] animals.
[23:32] Now in the New Testament,
[23:35] we ourselves,
[23:37] praise the name of our Lord, who have
[23:39] been redeemed of the Lord, we become the
[23:43] sacrifices.
[23:45] And so you must offer yourself
[23:50] as a willful sacrifice.
[23:55] You yourself
[23:56] just like our Lord Jesus Christ. He
[23:59] offered himself as a sacrifice
[24:04] willfully
[24:06] I laid down my life
[24:09] and take it back. And then he said there
[24:11] is no greater love
[24:14] than that a man should lay down his life
[24:16] for his friends.
[24:20] So then Christ now calls upon us
[24:24] and we become the sacrifices
[24:27] and then us being the sacrifices
[24:31] in the Old Testament the animal
[24:34] sacrifices
[24:36] they became dead.
[24:38] Praise the name of Lord. But then here
[24:41] us we offer our sacrifices
[24:45] and we still live.
[24:48] In other words, it is a continuous
[24:50] sacrifice.
[24:53] You you keep on offering to the Lord.
[24:56] When you give your life to the Lord
[24:57] Jesus Christ, you are offering yourself
[25:00] as a living sacrifice.
[25:04] When you do the things that God requires
[25:06] from you, you offering yourself as a
[25:09] living sacrifice.
[25:12] When you take time in prayers,
[25:14] you are offering yourself as a living
[25:16] sacrifice.
[25:18] When you give out what you have, you are
[25:21] offering sacrifice.
[25:24] When you do services of the Lord, you're
[25:26] offering sacrifice. So you find that
[25:29] Christian life is a life of sacrificing.
[25:34] It's a life of selfdenial.
[25:38] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[25:40] you deny your rights.
[25:42] You deny your your liberties.
[25:45] Everything you are considering to do
[25:47] things of the Lord.
[25:51] What should I do for the Lord from
[25:53] morning to evening? You are seeking how
[25:56] you can please the Lord.
[25:59] You know what the Bible says that he
[26:02] that marries
[26:04] seeks to please the other.
[26:08] And then even now in our salvation
[26:12] we accept the Lord Jesus as our personal
[26:15] as our savior.
[26:17] We need to seek to please him.
[26:21] We need to seek that we are we do things
[26:23] that are acceptable
[26:27] and you should always reserve that kind
[26:29] of mind.
[26:31] What I'm doing is it pleasing to the
[26:32] Lord.
[26:34] What I'm thinking is it pleasing to the
[26:36] Lord?
[26:37] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[26:39] there are people who are offering
[26:41] sacrifices
[26:43] and to them they thought that you know
[26:45] maybe doing the work
[26:48] you know that would be good enough. We
[26:51] can see one example here. Cain.
[26:54] The Bible says
[26:57] in Genesis 4,
[27:01] Genesis chapter 4
[27:04] and then we can read from verse three.
[27:10] The scripture says,
[27:13] &gt;&gt; "And in the process of time, it came to
[27:16] pass that Cain brought of the fruit of
[27:19] the ground an offering unto the Lord,
[27:30] and Abel he also brought of the
[27:33] firstlings of his flock, and of the fat
[27:36] thereof. And the Lord had respect unto
[27:40] Abel and his offering.
[27:54] But unto Cain, unto his offering, he had
[27:58] no respect. And Cain was very, and his
[28:01] countenance fell.
[28:13] brought an offering to God
[28:16] and you know he brought fruits
[28:21] and made the altar beautiful.
[28:25] You know his was the physical
[28:27] attraction,
[28:30] the physical kind of appearance
[28:33] and then the Bible says God was not
[28:37] acceptable
[28:41] accepting Cain
[28:43] and even his offering
[28:47] rejected them.
[28:49] Praise the name of Allah. But now when
[28:51] Abel brought his firsting of the flock
[28:57] The Bible says that God had respect unto
[29:00] Abel
[29:03] and his offering.
[29:05] So it matters also
[29:08] the kind of person who is offering to
[29:11] God.
[29:13] Praise the name of our Lord. Cain was
[29:16] rejected.
[29:17] Even his offering was rejected.
[29:21] Now the Bible says, "Praise the name of
[29:24] our Lord.
[29:25] In the in the book of Proverbs
[29:29] 15:8,
[29:33] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[29:34] &gt;&gt; "The sacrifice of the wicked is an
[29:37] abomination to the Lord,
[29:40] but the prayer of the upright is his
[29:43] delight.
[29:54] The way of the wicked is an abomination
[29:57] unto the Lord, but he loveth him that
[30:01] follows after righteousness.
[30:09] Praise the name of our Lord. So if you
[30:12] follow righteousness
[30:15] then the Bible says
[30:17] he loves that person who follows
[30:19] righteousness.
[30:21] And so when you pray
[30:24] praise the name of our Lord. The Lord
[30:27] loves that.
[30:29] He says he delights in the prayer of the
[30:30] upright.
[30:33] When the wicked person
[30:36] praying or offering a sacrifice,
[30:40] it's an abomination.
[30:43] Praise the name of the Lord. It's an
[30:45] abomination.
[30:46] You know, you can even remember
[30:49] in the times of Elisha
[30:52] when the king of Israel
[30:55] came to Elisha
[30:57] and he went there actually, you know,
[30:59] with Jehoshaphat,
[31:01] &gt;&gt; the king of Judah, the prophet said, if
[31:05] it was not for the righteous
[31:07] Jehoshaphat,
[31:10] I wouldn't have even talked to you or
[31:12] looked back to you.
[31:15] You see that the presence of the king of
[31:18] Israel,
[31:21] the son of Ahab
[31:24] traveled the prophet
[31:26] until the prophet said, "You get me
[31:28] somebody to get me back into the
[31:29] spirit."
[31:33] It was an abomination.
[31:35] And so now you can now look at these
[31:37] things.
[31:39] How about you having communion with the
[31:41] wicked people?
[31:44] They are your close friends. They are
[31:47] the people give you advice.
[31:49] They are your counselors.
[31:52] How much more
[31:54] you know will it trouble your prayer
[31:56] before God?
[31:58] When you spend time with things that are
[32:00] contrary to the word,
[32:04] watching things that are not right,
[32:06] hearing things that are not right, you
[32:08] know, speaking things that are not
[32:10] right, it affects your sacrifice
[32:15] when you come to offer it before the
[32:17] Lord.
[32:19] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[32:20] prophet said, it was not this man who is
[32:23] right here
[32:25] and hear what you want to say. was
[32:28] telling him, "Go back to the gods of
[32:30] your father.
[32:32] Go back to the gods of your mother."
[32:35] So now the Bible has told us that the
[32:38] sacrifices of the wicked
[32:42] are abominations to the Lord
[32:45] like a Bible says he was rejected.
[32:50] Even his sacrifice was rejected.
[32:55] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[32:57] Proverbs 28:9
[33:01] 28:9,
[33:04] the Bible says, "He that turneth away
[33:07] ear from hearing the law, even his
[33:10] prayer shall be abomination."
[33:20] Now he says, "If you turn your hair,
[33:25] from hearing the law.
[33:28] In other words, if you refuse to obey
[33:30] the word of God,
[33:34] then God would ask, "Why do you want me
[33:37] to hear you? You don't want to hear what
[33:40] I'm saying." You know, it's just the
[33:42] same thing in communication.
[33:46] Somebody talks to you, you don't pay
[33:48] attention. But now for you, when you you
[33:50] are talking, you want the person to pay
[33:52] attention.
[33:54] So that's what the Lord is saying. You
[33:56] don't hear what I'm telling. But then
[33:58] why do you want me to hear what you
[34:02] praise the name of our Lord? So he says
[34:05] if you don't hear the word of God,
[34:09] if you don't obey the law of the Lord,
[34:12] then your prayer
[34:14] is an abomination.
[34:18] Praise the name of our Lord because
[34:20] communion
[34:22] is a two-way
[34:24] He says come and let us reason together.
[34:29] And then on your side you have rejecting
[34:31] receiving from
[34:34] you want him to hear you say no it's
[34:38] under combination and that was the
[34:40] condition of Cain
[34:42] when the Lord told Cain if you do right
[34:47] you will be acceptable
[34:49] didn't want that he rejected the council
[34:52] of God
[34:54] he went ahead and killed Abel
[34:57] and so we need to see that we are
[34:59] careful
[35:01] in our Christian walk
[35:04] the name of our lord that you don't
[35:06] become a rebarious person
[35:13] you know a rebarious person however many
[35:16] times you tell him about something
[35:19] he does the contrary
[35:22] the contrary he justifies what he's
[35:24] doing
[35:26] but you see the Lord wants us to be
[35:28] obedient children.
[35:32] So if you hear the word of God
[35:35] and then you pray to God, in other
[35:38] words, if you open your ears to God,
[35:42] then you'll also open his ears to your
[35:44] prayer,
[35:46] you become acceptable before him. But if
[35:50] you reject his word, he also reject your
[35:53] word.
[35:55] Praise the name of our Lord. You pray
[35:57] and he says ah
[36:00] your prayer is an abomination
[36:02] I'm not hearing what you are saying
[36:05] praise the name of our Lord. So now the
[36:08] Bible has told us
[36:10] that if we are upright
[36:13] then God will delight in our prayers.
[36:19] Praise the name of Lord. So now let us
[36:22] get back to Genesis chapter 4.
[36:26] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[36:29] Bible says in verse five,
[36:32] but unto Cain and his offering,
[36:36] they had no respect.
[36:39] In other words, they were not accepted.
[36:43] K was not acceptable to God. Even what
[36:46] he did was not acceptable to God.
[36:50] God was telling Kane,
[36:52] "Get back and do what is right.
[36:56] Praise the name of the Lord. In verse
[36:58] seven,
[36:59] &gt;&gt; if you do well,
[37:01] shall you not be accepted?
[37:05] Praise the name of Lord. So God would
[37:08] desire us
[37:10] to do that which is right,
[37:14] that which is pleasing to him,
[37:17] then we can have, we can be an
[37:19] acceptable sacrifice.
[37:23] If you do not wear
[37:26] sin lies at the door
[37:30] and those shall be his desire.
[37:37] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[37:39] be an acceptable sacrifice unto God.
[37:44] You know the Bible talks about in
[37:46] Matthew chapter 7,
[37:49] the people
[37:52] who came to worship
[37:55] or they were serving in the ministry
[37:58] and indeed they had results in the
[38:00] ministry.
[38:02] Map 7:21.
[38:06] Not everyone that says unto me, Lord,
[38:08] Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
[38:11] heaven, but he that does the will of my
[38:13] father which is in heaven.
[38:19] Verse 7, verse 21.
[38:35] So these people knew how to worship the
[38:37] true God,
[38:40] but yet they were doing everything they
[38:43] would do
[38:44] outside of the will of God.
[38:48] But the Bible has told us in Romans
[38:52] chapter 12 and verse 2
[38:56] that we need to have our mind renewed
[39:01] and prove what is good
[39:05] and acceptable
[39:07] and perfect the will of God. And then
[39:12] these people here in Matthew chapter 7,
[39:15] they were busy doing what was
[39:19] service to the Lord,
[39:22] but it was not in the will of God,
[39:27] they were not acceptable,
[39:29] praise the name of our Lord. So in Mark
[39:32] 7:22,
[39:35] many will say to me in that day,
[39:40] Lord, Lord,
[39:42] have you not prophesied in your name?
[39:47] They prophesied.
[39:49] In other words, there was a
[39:51] manifestation of the Holy Spirit.
[39:54] Maybe they prophesied something and came
[39:56] to pass
[39:58] and then others they cast out demons
[40:02] and then people were delivered
[40:06] and then they did many wonderful works
[40:08] in the name of the Lord
[40:13] and you know they were standing before
[40:14] the Lord and said Lord I was part of
[40:17] your ministry.
[40:19] I was part of your kingdom here on
[40:22] earth. Everybody knew me.
[40:25] As a prophet, I prophesy and things come
[40:28] to pass. Everybody knew me as a person
[40:32] who is casting out demons. People were
[40:34] delivered. People were relieved. Did
[40:38] many wonderful works in your name.
[40:40] I said, Lord, I've come that the door
[40:43] may be open to me.
[40:46] And they say, and I will profess to
[40:48] them,
[40:50] I never knew you.
[40:54] Depart from me. You that work iniquity.
[41:00] They were rejected worshippers.
[41:05] They were rejected the way they rejected
[41:07] those of bad.
[41:13] But these ones were worshiping the true
[41:15] God.
[41:17] said, "I don't know you. Go away from
[41:20] me."
[41:21] Much as they had the spiritual
[41:23] manifestations of the God,
[41:28] themselves were rejected.
[41:31] They were not acceptable before him
[41:34] and we shouldn't try to live to be that
[41:37] kind of a person
[41:40] whereby you know what influences you is
[41:42] the manifestation of the Holy Spirit.
[41:46] But yet your life is not in the of God.
[41:52] That is the greatest embarrassment that
[41:54] will be.
[41:56] And that's what brother Brham says. That
[41:59] will be the greatest disappointment.
[42:03] A man in a banner will not be
[42:05] disappointed that day.
[42:07] Knows that he'll end up in hell.
[42:11] A man doing funny things will not be
[42:13] disappointed.
[42:14] But then those who are coming to church
[42:18] professing to be Christians
[42:21] and then the Lord says you are just a
[42:23] joker,
[42:26] you are fake.
[42:34] That's how bad it will be. And that's
[42:37] how he was telling them much as you did
[42:39] this but I don't know you.
[42:43] Praise the name of God. You know when
[42:45] you see Abraham,
[42:48] Abraham had many sons.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. But the
[42:55] Bible says, the other sons of the
[42:58] concubine.
[43:01] He gave them gifts
[43:04] and sent them away.
[43:07] Praise the name of our Lord. It was only
[43:09] Isaac,
[43:11] the son of the free woman,
[43:15] who received whatever Abraham.
[43:18] Praise the name of Allah. So, we don't
[43:20] look for gifts.
[43:23] Oh, I've spoken in tongues. I've
[43:26] prophesied. I've done this miracle. All
[43:29] those things of God. But that's not what
[43:31] brings us to church.
[43:34] Praise the name of God. We don't come
[43:36] for prosperity gospel.
[43:38] We don't come for natural benefit
[43:41] but what brings us here is the life of
[43:44] Jesus.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. That should
[43:48] be our essence.
[43:50] The main thing we are looking at. Let
[43:54] his life be formed in you.
[43:57] When his life is in me, he can't reject
[44:00] himself.
[44:02] The Bible says Jesus cannot deny
[44:05] himself.
[44:07] So if his life is in you,
[44:10] the Holy Spirit is in you, he can't say
[44:13] I don't know you because you are part of
[44:16] him. You come from him. Praise the name
[44:20] of our Lord. But the sons of the
[44:22] conscripts
[44:27] go away.
[44:29] Praise the name of our Lord. And this
[44:31] what we see in most of the denomination.
[44:34] They want manifestation of this of this.
[44:37] But they reject the word
[44:40] which is Christ. Praise the name of our
[44:42] Lord. But to us the word is precious
[44:46] because the bride has to become the word
[44:49] of God.
[44:51] Praise the name of our Lord. Just as the
[44:53] word put on flesh in Christ.
[44:56] So even now the word of God is putting
[45:00] flesh on the bride.
[45:04] The bride is becoming the manifestation
[45:06] of the word of God.
[45:09] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[45:11] to Ephesians chapter 5
[45:14] and then we start reading from verse
[45:16] one.
[45:18] Praise the name of our Lord.
[45:21] The Bible says be therefore followers of
[45:24] God as dear children.
[45:34] and walk in love as Christ also has
[45:38] loved us and has given himself for us an
[45:42] offering and a sacrifice to God for a
[45:46] sweet smelling savor.
[46:05] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[46:07] Bible is telling us Christ gave himself
[46:13] as an offering
[46:16] and a sacrifice
[46:18] unto God. So then he's telling us also
[46:22] let us also
[46:25] as Christ did
[46:28] he loved us
[46:29] &gt;&gt; and he gave himself for us. So we also
[46:33] need to give ourselves over to God
[46:38] and then walk in the love of God.
[46:42] You walk in the word of God,
[46:46] in the obedience of God,
[46:49] saying that you are acceptable to God.
[46:53] God has accepted you as a sacrifice.
[46:57] The way the Bible says, the delight of
[46:59] God
[47:01] is the prayer of the righteous people.
[47:04] So when the righteous prays, God wants
[47:08] to hear what you are teaching.
[47:10] Praise the name of our Lord. So even all
[47:13] our services to the Lord,
[47:16] when you come to serve the Lord, you
[47:19] serve it to the Lord. Whatever you do,
[47:23] you do it with all your heart,
[47:26] doing unto men,
[47:28] maybe not doing it unto your boss, but
[47:31] you're doing everything in the name of
[47:33] the Lord.
[47:35] At the end of the day, the Lord may
[47:37] receive that glory.
[47:40] Praise the name of our Lord. So God
[47:42] would desire us
[47:44] to offer willingly
[47:48] with a perfect heart,
[47:51] not doubleminded.
[47:54] Let me try this or maybe it's an
[47:57] obligation.
[48:01] If I don't do it, they will say this and
[48:02] this.
[48:07] That's not with a pure heart.
[48:10] But you know, whatever you do, Lord, I'm
[48:13] doing this in the name of God.
[48:16] Praise the name of God. You are giving
[48:19] yourself,
[48:21] you know, offering a sacrifice,
[48:25] pure
[48:27] from your heart
[48:29] with all your mind into it.
[48:33] Praise the name of our Lord. In Exodus
[48:36] 20 25:1,
[48:40] the Bible says, "And the Lord spoke unto
[48:43] Moses, saying, speak unto the children
[48:46] of Israel, that they may bring me an
[48:49] offering of every man that giveth it
[48:52] willingly with his heart shall take my
[48:56] offering.
[49:15] Praise the name of our God. He said,
[49:17] "Offer willingly
[49:21] with your heart,
[49:24] perfect sacrifice,
[49:26] acceptable sacrifice.
[49:29] something you're doing from your heart.
[49:32] You're not being compelled.
[49:35] You know, you're not being forced.
[49:38] You know, you're not doing it because of
[49:40] advantage,
[49:43] but you are doing it in the name of the
[49:45] Lord.
[49:47] Say, Lord, I know this is my obligation.
[49:51] Praise the name of the Lord. The life
[49:53] that we live
[49:55] should be a sacrifice unto them.
[49:58] Sweet smelling savor
[50:03] see your life then he's pleased. My
[50:07] blood is not shed on the cross for
[50:09] nothing.
[50:12] My blood has changed this one.
[50:15] My blood has transformed this one.
[50:19] Your conduct has been changed.
[50:22] Your speech has been changed. Your walk
[50:24] has been changed. A sweet smelling
[50:27] savor.
[50:29] Praise the name of acceptable unto God.
[50:33] So our sacrifices
[50:36] the life that we live
[50:39] holy living
[50:41] is a hol is a sacrifice and the Lord
[50:44] wants it you know holy.
[50:48] Praise the name of our lord. In the
[50:50] scriptures here in 1 Peter 2:5,
[50:55] the Bible says, "Ye also as lively
[51:00] stones are built up a spiritual house
[51:04] and holy priesthood to offer up
[51:07] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[51:10] by Jesus Christ.
[51:26] Praise the name of the Lord. So your
[51:28] life is a sacrifice before
[51:32] a life that is acceptable
[51:36] like the high priest. He had to walk
[51:38] acceptably before God.
[51:42] Whenever you go into the holies of
[51:43] holies
[51:45] bells around him and then there was a
[51:48] rope tied to that.
[51:50] So there's a walk that God expected him
[51:53] to walk
[51:55] and there's also a walk that God expects
[51:57] us to walk
[52:00] to walk in places that are not right
[52:04] to do things that are not right. To
[52:06] think about things that are not right
[52:09] to see things that are not right.
[52:12] to hear things that are not right.
[52:15] He wants us to have an acceptable walk
[52:19] as a liveless storm.
[52:22] The Holy Spirit in you
[52:25] guides you into all truth
[52:29] to do things that the Lord will desire
[52:31] to do.
[52:33] As lively stones,
[52:36] built up a spiritual house.
[52:40] So then we are a holy priesthood
[52:43] and a priest offers sacrifices.
[52:47] Praise the name of this is the desire of
[52:50] God that we can be acceptable
[52:52] sacrifices.
[52:55] As a priest,
[52:57] a holy priesthood,
[52:59] then you are meant to offer spiritual
[53:01] sacrifice,
[53:04] giving your life over to the Lord,
[53:08] over the things of the kingdom
[53:11] that the Lord delights in.
[53:14] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[53:16] the way the Lord would say, I delight
[53:18] when he's praying.
[53:20] I want to hear him when he's praying.
[53:24] that were taught about Job,
[53:27] praise the name of our Lord, you know
[53:29] Job then God telling Job's friends
[53:34] that you know I will not hear you but
[53:37] you go to Job so they went with their
[53:40] sacrifice to Job
[53:42] and now when Job prayed to God
[53:46] then God accepted this
[53:48] praise the name of our Lord and we know
[53:50] Christ is accepted for us.
[53:55] If we can also live the life of Jesus
[53:57] Christ,
[53:59] we are also accepted for others.
[54:03] You can intercede for another person.
[54:07] You can pray overration
[54:09] and frustration changes.
[54:12] Praise the name of our like Jehoshaphat.
[54:16] It was acceptable
[54:18] because of the other king was worshiping
[54:20] idol.
[54:22] And then the prophet saying, "If it was
[54:24] not Jehoshaphat,
[54:27] praise the name of the Lord, I would
[54:29] have not looked to you." But yet when
[54:32] the prophet went into the spirit of God
[54:36] was able to get a solution for Israel.
[54:40] Praise the name of our Lord, standing
[54:42] for one another. That's why it is always
[54:45] very important for us that we live life
[54:48] that are acceptable
[54:51] as sacrifices.
[54:53] Then you can be a solution to your home.
[54:57] You can be a solution to your place of
[54:59] work.
[55:00] You can be a solution
[55:03] troubles that afflict others.
[55:06] You can stand up in prayer where the
[55:09] Lord can reveal to you and tell you go
[55:12] and do this and this.
[55:14] Praise the name of Lord like Abraham
[55:17] standing in for Lord. And the Bible say
[55:21] when God remembered Abraham,
[55:25] he had mercy on Lord. Let us go to
[55:28] Genesis chapter 19.
[55:31] Praise the name of our Lord. Abraham was
[55:34] an acceptable sacrifice
[55:37] that he would intercede for Lot
[55:41] until God spared Sodom. Spared Lot.
[55:47] Praise the name of our Lord because of
[55:50] Abraham.
[55:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Genesis
[55:55] chapter 19
[55:57] and then verse 29.
[56:02] And it came to pass when God destroyed
[56:05] the cities of the plain that God
[56:08] remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of
[56:11] the midst of the overthrow when he
[56:13] overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
[56:35] Praise the name of our Lord. You can
[56:37] look at backsliding lot
[56:41] in his cities which are immoral.
[56:45] The prayers of Abraham this side.
[56:50] God accepted it.
[56:52] God had respect upon the prayer of
[56:55] Abraham
[56:57] and he was able to deliver a lot
[57:00] and we may have many lots in our
[57:05] many lots in our family.
[57:08] There are people who are no longer
[57:09] coming to church.
[57:11] He's having this excuse having this
[57:14] reason
[57:16] to some extent like a lot.
[57:19] You can now also stand for that
[57:21] brotherhood.
[57:23] Lord bring back my brother.
[57:26] Lord bring back my sister.
[57:29] Praise the name of like today we have a
[57:31] we have the Lord's supper
[57:34] but you may find some people are not
[57:36] around in the afternoon service
[57:40] because they have a condition like Lord.
[57:44] So you intercede for such a person.
[57:47] Lord, I pray for brothers and aunts. I
[57:50] pray for sisters and aunts that the Lord
[57:53] may deliver them out of the circumstance
[57:58] that is holding them. Praise the name of
[58:01] our Lord. And you know when God gives
[58:04] you grace,
[58:06] you need to stand for another person
[58:10] just as Christ stood for us.
[58:13] Praise the name of our Lord. You say,
[58:14] "Lord, I pray for my brother
[58:17] for my sister. There
[58:19] &gt;&gt; is a condition that's taking them away
[58:21] from fellowship.
[58:23] There's a condition that's pulling them
[58:25] back.
[58:27] Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[58:29] don't just become an acceptable
[58:30] sacrifice
[58:33] for your own self but also for others.
[58:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Brother
[58:39] Brandham says eternal life is living for
[58:44] others.
[58:45] Praise the name of our Lord. You
[58:47] remember those in prayer. I used to come
[58:50] with brother and so in church
[58:53] but he no longer come. So you stand in
[58:55] the gap.
[58:57] Praise the name of our Lord. I used to
[58:59] come with sister so and so but she no
[59:01] longer come. You intercede for her. You
[59:05] intercede for him. You take forward and
[59:08] encourage them.
[59:11] Why don't you come and we fellowship
[59:12] together?
[59:14] reaching out where they are, giving them
[59:17] a call.
[59:18] Praise the name of our Lord. Of course,
[59:20] you don't call them to accuse them.
[59:24] Express the love of God to you.
[59:27] Praise the name of our Lord. The Lord
[59:29] loves you. The Lord delights in you.
[59:32] That's why he's still keeping you.
[59:35] The Lord delighted in Lord.
[59:38] That's why he sent the angels there
[59:41] by a span deliverance.
[59:45] You can imagine the condition of Lord
[59:48] that he kept on lingering in sodom.
[59:52] They telling him we are going to destroy
[59:53] this city.
[59:55] But then maybe was looking where is my
[59:57] bank account?
[59:59] Where is this person? I demand money,
[1:00:01] why is this one here?
[1:00:04] Until the angels just caught their
[1:00:06] hands.
[1:00:08] and pull them out of the desert.
[1:00:12] Praise the name of Lord. We need to
[1:00:14] stand for one another.
[1:00:17] You don't only pray for yourself. You
[1:00:19] don't only pray for your family when you
[1:00:22] are praying. So Lord help us. There is
[1:00:25] this
[1:00:26] Lord we have this need. Lord we have
[1:00:29] this condition. So then you reach out.
[1:00:33] Praise the name of our Lord. You are
[1:00:35] offering yourself
[1:00:37] as a living sacrifice.
[1:00:40] Your prayers are a sacrifice.
[1:00:43] Praise the name of our Lord. Your
[1:00:45] service to the Lord is a sacrifice.
[1:00:48] Praise the name of our Lord. So you are
[1:00:50] reaching out to help somebody
[1:00:53] even when somebody is in need.
[1:00:57] You know even that we are talking about
[1:00:58] the spiritual need
[1:01:02] of God but there also physical need
[1:01:06] where you can also sacrifice.
[1:01:10] Praise the name of God for a physical
[1:01:13] need
[1:01:15] like the scripture pastor was talking
[1:01:17] about this morning.
[1:01:20] Elijah and the widow woman.
[1:01:24] The widow woman offered a sacrifice
[1:01:29] to help the prophet.
[1:01:31] Brother Brandham teaches about Elijah
[1:01:33] and the meal offering.
[1:01:39] It's the woman who had the meal
[1:01:40] offering.
[1:01:43] She offered it. Praise the name of our
[1:01:46] Lord and it helped the prophet but in
[1:01:49] turn also helped her.
[1:01:52] The Bible say if you have a lot or if
[1:01:56] you have two you know you have two
[1:01:59] shirts or two things another person is
[1:02:02] naked you offer it to that person.
[1:02:07] Your giving
[1:02:09] is also a sacrifice.
[1:02:11] Praise the name of our Lord. Like when
[1:02:13] we have needs around, you identify this
[1:02:16] is the need. Then you offer the
[1:02:19] sacrifice.
[1:02:21] I'm going to do this and this. I'm going
[1:02:23] to do this and this. There's this need
[1:02:26] that is lacking.
[1:02:28] I'm going to take up this position.
[1:02:31] Praise the name of our Lord because the
[1:02:33] need that is there. So you are offering
[1:02:36] a sacrifice.
[1:02:38] You are giving your time. You are giving
[1:02:41] your resources.
[1:02:43] Praise the name of our Lord. And the
[1:02:45] Lord blesses you for that.
[1:02:48] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:02:50] to Philippians 4:13.
[1:02:55] He says, "I can do all things through
[1:03:00] Christ which strengthens me.
[1:03:06] Philippians 4:13.
[1:03:27] Notwithstanding,
[1:03:28] you have done, you have well done that
[1:03:32] you did communicate with my affliction.
[1:03:45] beginning of the gospel. When I departed
[1:03:48] from Macedonia, no church communicated
[1:03:51] with me as concerning giving and
[1:03:53] receiving, but ye only.
[1:04:17] So now they were helping the saints.
[1:04:21] They knew there was a need somewhere
[1:04:24] and they had something
[1:04:27] and that should be of concern even to
[1:04:28] us.
[1:04:30] You know maybe a brother they don't have
[1:04:32] any food.
[1:04:34] There's a family in distress.
[1:04:38] Maybe they are sick or they are in any
[1:04:40] condition.
[1:04:42] Can you go and give them support?
[1:04:45] Like now the Bible says in Mark chapter
[1:04:47] 25,
[1:04:49] I was sick and you visited me. I was in
[1:04:53] prison and you visited me. I was hungry
[1:04:57] and you fed me. Then you can ask Lord
[1:05:00] where do we find me?
[1:05:02] So you can find that the children of God
[1:05:06] can be caught up in those kind of
[1:05:08] conditions.
[1:05:10] A condition of a particular need,
[1:05:13] a condition of a particular distress.
[1:05:17] So you need to go there
[1:05:19] and then supply the need.
[1:05:23] Give the support that is required in
[1:05:24] that.
[1:05:26] So you are offering up a sacrifice.
[1:05:30] Praise the name of our Lord. And the
[1:05:32] Bible says we should not be weary
[1:05:36] in welloing.
[1:05:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Be there be
[1:05:42] doing well all the time.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; What you can do to get with joy,
[1:05:49] praise the name of God. Like when you
[1:05:51] get our sister Anna Ok in the hospital,
[1:05:56] if she hears about anybody there,
[1:06:00] she's always there to get the right
[1:06:03] physician
[1:06:04] to see that she can get a support which
[1:06:06] she can do
[1:06:09] because that's the ability the Lord has
[1:06:10] given her.
[1:06:12] Or if you're in a position of influence,
[1:06:16] praise the name of our Lord, maybe you
[1:06:18] can influence giving of jobs.
[1:06:22] Then you know surely the believers in
[1:06:25] our church
[1:06:27] brother can do this one sister can do
[1:06:29] this work. You move out and ask them can
[1:06:33] you do this? Can you do this? There's an
[1:06:36] opportunity here.
[1:06:38] Praise the name of our Lord. So you are
[1:06:40] trying to see that you help your
[1:06:41] household.
[1:06:45] Praise the name of our Lord. Somebody's
[1:06:47] lacking this. But I have this
[1:06:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Then you
[1:06:52] move out and give that
[1:06:55] blessed be the name of our Lord. That's
[1:06:57] why we need to live as a body.
[1:07:00] You know that there is no lack anywhere.
[1:07:05] There is a need for this person.
[1:07:07] What can I do to help him?
[1:07:10] Praise the name of our Lord. So now the
[1:07:12] churches here in Philippians
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; and Macedonia they were busy supplying
[1:07:19] from the resources they had
[1:07:23] for the need of the saints were in
[1:07:24] Jerusalem
[1:07:28] because they were not in good shape.
[1:07:31] Praise the name of our Lord. And I can
[1:07:33] tell you the need of the ministry is so
[1:07:37] enormous.
[1:07:40] Praise the name of our Lord. So much
[1:07:43] enormous.
[1:07:44] So you need to take interest
[1:07:51] different situations in different areas.
[1:07:55] Take interest. Lord, what can I be
[1:07:58] involved in?
[1:08:00] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:08:01] sometimes I ask myself
[1:08:04] if the rapture comes today
[1:08:07] and I have a lot of money on account.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; So what will happen?
[1:08:14] Praise the name of I have bked a lot of
[1:08:16] money on the account.
[1:08:19] But with a lot of money I have
[1:08:22] there other spiritual needs.
[1:08:25] So I turn a blind eye.
[1:08:31] God give them grace to go through that
[1:08:33] situation. But what I can do to help
[1:08:36] you stop a lot of things.
[1:08:40] I will not go with them in the rapture.
[1:08:42] You just leave them here. But why
[1:08:45] wouldn't I get what I have and put into
[1:08:48] the kingdom of God?
[1:08:51] Praise the name of God. You know the
[1:08:53] devil is a liar.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the name over Lord. After all the
[1:08:59] rapture is soon taking place.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; But then why are you talking that
[1:09:04] why wouldn't you help the one soul to
[1:09:06] come into the king?
[1:09:09] Praise the name of our Lord. But you see
[1:09:12] Satan is a liar.
[1:09:14] He can divert your attention on this.
[1:09:18] Divert your attention on this. And then
[1:09:20] you find yourself
[1:09:23] that you are not doing anything for the
[1:09:25] kingdom of God.
[1:09:28] Praise the name of our Lord. But we need
[1:09:30] to see that we are involved in the work
[1:09:32] of the kingdom.
[1:09:36] Be involved in the affairs of the
[1:09:37] church,
[1:09:40] supporting them, your resources, your
[1:09:43] time, your prayer, doing everything you
[1:09:47] can, participating in the church
[1:09:50] programs,
[1:09:52] coming in time. We have the Sunday
[1:09:54] school starting at 10,
[1:09:57] but then you find you've come when the
[1:09:58] Sunday school is over.
[1:10:02] you know be involved in the things of
[1:10:04] the king
[1:10:06] that you are part of the move of the
[1:10:08] Lord in
[1:10:11] praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[1:10:13] to see that we offer an acceptable
[1:10:16] sacrifice to God
[1:10:20] and you know God accepts a sacrifice
[1:10:25] which costs you something.
[1:10:34] Not that those ones are there just for
[1:10:37] nothing. You know there are some people
[1:10:40] they say okay if it is to come to church
[1:10:46] I'll come when I have done everything I
[1:10:47] was able to do
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; that's not a sacrifice now
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; but a sacrifice
[1:10:53] should cost you something
[1:10:57] so you don't say Wednesday service I'll
[1:11:01] come when the clients are not coming
[1:11:06] so you've opened your shop.
[1:11:09] You've been there from morning
[1:11:12] when it is 4:30
[1:11:14] when they start coming. I think this the
[1:11:17] time God wanted me to work
[1:11:22] then you say let me wait 5:30 they are
[1:11:25] still coming. God has blessed me with a
[1:11:28] good
[1:11:30] day.
[1:11:35] God is here wanting to speak to you.
[1:11:38] You saying
[1:11:42] you are saying that God is blessing me.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; God wants a sacrifice
[1:11:47] which will cost you something.
[1:11:50] You know 5 4:30
[1:11:54] I have to be packing
[1:11:56] going to the church. that sacrifice
[1:12:00] praise the name of our lord not because
[1:12:02] there is no business
[1:12:05] sometimes
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; you at home you even don't have
[1:12:09] transport
[1:12:11] today I don't have transport
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; so church will not see me
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; and you here invort
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; it's not costing you anything
[1:12:29] you sacrifice.
[1:12:32] Supposing it was your place of work.
[1:12:36] Would you tell your boss, I didn't have
[1:12:38] transport,
[1:12:40] you lose the job, but then when it comes
[1:12:43] to God, God, you know what I'm going
[1:12:46] through?
[1:12:48] You know, I slept hungry last night.
[1:12:52] Praise the name of God.
[1:12:54] We have to have a sacrifice
[1:12:57] that costs us something.
[1:13:01] Like here in the book of 2 Samuel
[1:13:03] chapter 24
[1:13:06] and then verse 18,
[1:13:09] the Bible says,
[1:13:11] "And God came that day to David and said
[1:13:14] unto him, go up rare and altar unto the
[1:13:19] Lord in the ththing floor of Aria the
[1:13:22] Jebusite."
[1:13:36] Now there were many people who are dying
[1:13:38] in Israel
[1:13:42] and now the intervention was needed
[1:13:46] for that plague to be stayed.
[1:13:51] The Bible says in verse 15, "So the Lord
[1:13:55] sent a pestilence upon Israel
[1:14:01] from the morning from the morning even
[1:14:04] to the time appointed
[1:14:09] and there died of the people from Dan
[1:14:11] even to Basha 7,000
[1:14:14] men.
[1:14:27] Praise the name of the Lord. There was a
[1:14:29] crisis
[1:14:31] and then God revealed to David
[1:14:34] that got to this place and then you
[1:14:38] offer there a sacrifice.
[1:14:41] So now when David goes to Arana
[1:14:46] then he gets him
[1:14:48] He says, "I've come to offer sacrifice
[1:14:50] to the Lord."
[1:14:52] And then the man told him, "No, king."
[1:14:55] You use it, you don't pay.
[1:14:58] David said in verse 24,
[1:15:02] and the king said unto Aruna,
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; n,
[1:15:08] "But I will surely bite of thee at a
[1:15:12] price,
[1:15:16] neither will I offer burnt offerings
[1:15:18] unto my Lord of that which cost me
[1:15:22] nothing.
[1:15:33] So David bought the threshing floor and
[1:15:36] the oxen for 50 shekels of silver.
[1:15:46] Praise the name of our Lord. Our
[1:15:48] sacrifices
[1:15:49] should cost us something.
[1:15:52] They cost your time,
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; your money,
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; even your strength.
[1:15:59] You are investing yourself into it.
[1:16:02] You're not saying, "I'm going to wait on
[1:16:04] the Lord when I'm on leave."
[1:16:08] You know, when things are not busy,
[1:16:11] I'm going to wait on the Lord when I'm
[1:16:13] in a holiday.
[1:16:15] The best time to offer the sacrifice
[1:16:19] is now. Praise the name of our Lord. A
[1:16:23] living sacrifice
[1:16:25] acceptable unto the Lord.
[1:16:28] And David said, I will not offer to God
[1:16:33] what costs me nothing.
[1:16:36] When I'm giving to God like in those
[1:16:38] days it was animals.
[1:16:42] He said, you don't give one which is
[1:16:44] sick
[1:16:46] because you don't like it.
[1:16:49] Are you no
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; the lame one because it doesn't cost you
[1:16:55] anything.
[1:16:56] No,
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; you give the best.
[1:17:00] Say, Lord, I'm giving you this.
[1:17:03] Praise the name of our giving the best
[1:17:05] to the Lord.
[1:17:08] You give the best of your time to the
[1:17:09] Lord.
[1:17:12] You don't remember to pray when you are
[1:17:13] very tired.
[1:17:16] You are sleepy
[1:17:18] until when you go to pray you are just
[1:17:20] dozing.
[1:17:22] You wake up and remember that you are
[1:17:24] praying.
[1:17:28] Pray when you are very attentive,
[1:17:31] when there are no interruption,
[1:17:34] read the Bible, read the message book
[1:17:37] when you are fully awake.
[1:17:40] Morning hours are the best time
[1:17:44] because you are fresh. So you wake up
[1:17:46] early,
[1:17:48] you pray, you read, you hear. What a
[1:17:52] good day to start a day.
[1:17:55] Praise the name of our Lord. You start
[1:17:57] waiting on the Lord
[1:17:59] upon the Lord, praying to the Lord,
[1:18:03] reading his word. Your mind is composed.
[1:18:08] And many people make decisions in the
[1:18:10] morning,
[1:18:12] then they kind of review in the night.
[1:18:16] Praise the name of the Lord. You're
[1:18:18] making decisions for your day.
[1:18:21] You are putting it before the Lord.
[1:18:24] Lord, as I start out my day, you commit
[1:18:27] so and so. You pray about it. I'm going
[1:18:31] to this kind of activity. You pray about
[1:18:33] it. You commit everything
[1:18:37] one by one before the Lord.
[1:18:40] Praise the name of God. We need to offer
[1:18:43] ourselves as living sacrifices.
[1:18:48] Acceptable sacrifices.
[1:18:51] Your prayer is a sacrifice. Your giving
[1:18:55] is a sacrifice. Holy living is a
[1:18:59] sacrifice. Serving the Lord is a
[1:19:02] sacrifice.
[1:19:04] And that's how the Lord wants us to live
[1:19:06] life
[1:19:07] in our life's journey.
[1:19:10] Let us be living acceptable sacrifices.
[1:19:16] When you are serving the Lord, don't do
[1:19:18] it for many pleasing
[1:19:21] or to do it because it is your
[1:19:23] obligation
[1:19:25] to do it in the name of the Lord.
[1:19:28] doing this in your name,
[1:19:30] we bring glory and honor to you. Praise
[1:19:33] the name of our Lord. We need to be
[1:19:35] acceptable sacrifice
[1:19:39] in everything we do before the Lord
[1:19:42] that the Lord can be pleased
[1:19:45] by what we are doing. Praise the name of
[1:19:47] Lord. May God bless you.
[1:19:50] Amen. [applause] Amen. Let us sing this
[1:19:54] song down at the cross as the song
[1:19:55] leader comes.
[1:19:58] Praise the name of the Lord. Down at the
[1:20:02] cross where my s
[1:20:09] down from cleansing
[1:20:13] from sin I cry.
[1:20:18] There to my heart was the blood of
[1:20:25] Hallelujah. [music and singing]
[1:20:26] Glory
[1:20:29] to his name.
[1:20:35] Glory
[1:20:37] to
[1:20:39] his holy
[1:20:41] name.
[1:20:43] Oh, gloryy
[1:20:45] [singing] to his name.
[1:20:52] Oh, there to my eyes was the blood of

[1:46:32] may come upon every one of us. We pray
[1:46:36] heavenly father blessing the reading of
[1:46:39] the word
[1:46:41] to show us that we are following what
[1:46:42] you've told us to do. [music]
[1:46:45] We also bless the breaking of bread
[1:46:49] and we also bless father the

[1:46:53] that Lord as we partake of these things
[1:46:56] we may all be blessed.
[1:46:59] Pray may bless [music] the bread before
[1:47:00] us.
[1:47:02] Also bless the wine father that father
[1:47:05] they may be able to meet oh God the
[1:47:07] condition which they are meant to be
[1:47:09] consumed for your body [music]
[1:47:12] for the glory and honor of your holy in
[1:47:15] the name of the Lord Jesus who grant us
[1:47:17] grace. [music]
[1:47:19] Amen. Amen. Let us read second
[1:47:21] Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:47:29] 1 Corinthians chapter 11
[1:47:32] and then verse 23.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; "For I have received of the Lord that
[1:47:40] which also I delivered unto you, that
[1:47:43] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:47:45] he was betrayed took bread.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; And when he had given thanks, he broke
[1:48:01] it and said, "Take it. This is my body
[1:48:05] which is broken for you. This do in
[1:48:08] remembrance of me."
[1:48:20] And after the same manner also he took
[1:48:22] the cup when he had sapped, saying,
[1:48:25] "This cup is the new testament in my
[1:48:28] blood. This do as often as you drink it
[1:48:31] in remembrance of me.
[1:48:45] For as often as you eat this bread and
[1:48:48] drink this cup, you do show the Lord his
[1:48:51] death till he come.
[1:49:02] Amen. Let us pray again.
[1:49:05] Father in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:49:08] dedicate this unleavened bread into your
[1:49:11] hands,
[1:49:13] you meet, Father, the purpose which has
[1:49:15] been made.
[1:49:18] Bless every one of us. And Lord, we know
[1:49:23] that when you served the communion the
[1:49:24] first time to Abraham,
[1:49:29] you gave him strength to walk the rest
[1:49:30] that was laid ahead of him.
[1:49:34] us as we partake of this tonight.
[1:49:37] Give us strength, Father, to walk the
[1:49:40] journey that still lays ahead of us. May
[1:49:43] you heal the sick in our ministry.
[1:49:46] May you deliver those that are bound in
[1:49:48] different situations.
[1:49:50] Grant your grace to all your children
[1:49:54] to rejoice heavenly father for being
[1:49:56] obedient to your word. We love you and
[1:49:59] we bless you in the name of the Lord
[1:50:02] Jesus.
[1:50:04] Amen. You may be seated.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Shall keep on meditating.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; I'm tired
[1:50:15] of sin
[1:50:19] and straight.
[1:50:26] Now
[1:50:28] I'm coming
[1:50:32] home.
[1:50:38] How trust [music]
[1:50:41] thy [singing]
[1:50:42] love
[1:50:44] be [music]
[1:50:48] thy word.
[1:50:52] Lord, [music]
[1:50:54] I'm coming
[1:50:58] [music]
