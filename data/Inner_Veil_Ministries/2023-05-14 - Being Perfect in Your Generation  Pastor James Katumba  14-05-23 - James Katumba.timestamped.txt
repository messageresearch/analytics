[40:21] your welcome brother Bill when all
[40:22] Uganda
[40:24] just raise up your hands
[40:27] we have to have you
[40:30] I mean
[40:32] they were part of the members of the
[40:34] church in the early 90s I think
[40:39] those are over 30 years ago
[40:45] now let us stand up to our Bibles
[40:50] let us offer the word of prayer
[40:53] father in the name of our Lord Jesus
[40:55] Christ we want to thank you for this
[40:58] morning for your love grace and mercy
[41:02] your goodness Lord upon us
[41:05] you said we are taught three are
[41:07] gathered in your name
[41:12] and Lord we believe you are here in our
[41:15] meeting if you also promised in your
[41:18] words
[41:19] they shall be told of the Lord
[41:22] how great shall be their peace we pray
[41:26] Lord you may teach us through your words
[41:32] that has been smitten foreign
[42:13] let us go to Genesis chapter six
[42:17] and then we read from verse 1 to verse
[42:20] 9.
[42:21] the Bible says and it came to pass when
[42:25] men began to multiply on the face of the
[42:28] Earth
[42:29] uh
[42:33] and daughters were born unto them that
[42:36] the sons of God saw the daughters of men
[42:39] that they were fair and they took them
[42:41] wise of all which they chose
[42:52] and the Lord said my spirit shall not
[42:55] always strive with man for he also is
[42:58] flesh yet his days shall be
[43:01] 120 years
[43:15] and there were giants in the earth in
[43:17] those days and also after
[43:20] when the sons of God came in unto the
[43:22] daughters of men and they bear children
[43:25] to them the same became Mighty Men which
[43:28] were of old men of renowned
[43:39] foods
[43:46] and God saw the wickedness of man was
[43:49] great in the earth and that every
[43:51] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[43:54] was only evil continually
[44:03] um
[44:07] and it repented the Lord that he had
[44:09] made man on Earth and it grieved him at
[44:12] his heart
[44:17] and the Lord said I will destroy my and
[44:20] whom I have created from the face of the
[44:23] Earth both man and Beast and the
[44:25] creeping thing and the Falls of the air
[44:28] for it repenteth me that I have made
[44:30] them
[44:31] guarantee
[44:34] okay
[44:42] but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the
[44:46] Lord
[44:49] these are the generations of Noah Noah
[44:52] was a just and perfect man in his
[44:55] generation and walked and Noah walked
[44:58] with God
[44:59] no
[45:09] ways
[45:14] amen amen so this morning by the grace
[45:17] of God
[45:18] I want to pretend
[45:22] being perfect in your generation
[45:26] being perfect in your generation
[45:29] so the Bible has told us
[45:32] that no one was perfect in his
[45:35] generation
[45:38] praise the name of our Lord no one was
[45:41] perfect in his generation
[45:44] and then the Bible says that Noah walked
[45:49] with God
[45:51] praise the name of Allah and also if we
[45:54] want to be perfect in our generation
[46:01] we need to walk with God
[46:05] but now here we are living in a time
[46:09] that we don't only walk with God
[46:13] but God walks in Us
[46:17] Praise the name of Allah
[46:20] foreign
[46:28] Enoch walked with God
[46:31] and then the Bible says and the Enoch
[46:34] was not found
[46:36] because he was not
[46:40] praise the name of Allah but he walked
[46:44] with God and then it pleased God to take
[46:48] Enoch to heaven
[46:50] in the days of Noah Noah walked with God
[46:54] and then it pleased to secure the lives
[46:58] of Noah and his family
[47:00] from the flags but then we have a
[47:04] greater testimony
[47:07] those people in the Old Testament we are
[47:11] living under the blood of animals
[47:13] then we in the New Testament we live in
[47:17] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ so we
[47:20] have a greater witness we have a greater
[47:23] testimony now in second Corinthians
[47:26] chapter six
[47:28] the Bible says Bible cover and then
[47:31] verse 16.
[47:33] and what agreement has the temple of God
[47:36] with Idols for you are the Temple of the
[47:39] Living God as God has said I will dwell
[47:43] in them and walk in them and I will be
[47:46] their God and they shall be my people
[47:55] um
[48:06] so the Bible is telling us we are the
[48:10] Temple of the Living God
[48:13] we are the house of God we are the
[48:17] building of God
[48:18] and so God desires to dwell in us
[48:24] the way he desired to walk with energy
[49:26] then you are going to be perfect foreign
[50:21] [Music]
[50:35] [Music]
[50:40] when the sins is also increase
[50:44] depression is also increase
[50:46] we are living in the days
[50:55] then the interactions increase
[50:59] praise the name of us so you find that
[51:02] you know depressions were so high yeah
[51:05] and then the Bible says
[51:10] [Music]
[51:12] now the sons of God where the children
[51:16] that were coming from Adam
[51:20] the line of others is what the Bible
[51:24] calls the sons
[51:28] because Adam was a Son of God
[51:33] so the people came from Adam they became
[51:37] the children of God and now the sons of
[51:40] God we are meant to marry the daughters
[51:44] of God
[51:46] praise the name of us the sons of God
[51:50] they are meant to marry from the
[51:52] daughters of
[52:18] you know like somebody marrying from
[52:21] outside
[52:23] they were not meant to marry from
[52:25] another line
[52:29] the people of God Were Meant to marry
[52:32] from among the people of God
[52:35] but now the people of God started going
[52:39] out but
[52:41] just like maybe what a brother or sister
[52:44] would do
[52:45] she wants to get a husband
[52:48] she just goes out the people who don't
[52:50] believe in Christ
[53:08] let us go good First Corinthians
[53:13] praise the name of Allah First
[53:15] Corinthians chapter seven
[53:20] chapter 7 and verse 39.
[53:30] the Bible says
[53:33] the wife is bound by the law as long as
[53:36] her husband liveth but if her husband be
[53:39] dead she is at Liberty to be married to
[53:42] whom she will only in the Lord
[53:49] um
[54:02] so the Bible says
[54:09] in
[54:36] [Music]
[54:39] you need to get from the Lord
[54:42] you need to marry a daughter of God you
[54:47] need to marry a Son of God
[54:49] praise the name of it and then if you
[54:52] want to get a right wife
[54:54] you want to get the right husband
[54:57] you yourself as an individual you need
[55:01] to be right with God first
[55:04] praise the name of our Lord if you are
[55:06] not right with God you will not get the
[55:09] right person
[55:23] foreign
[55:26] how did I get you
[55:29] you know what the Bible says they will
[55:32] deceive and they will also be deceived
[55:35] so you deceive here then you get a
[55:39] smarter person yeah
[55:45] so you need to check your ways
[55:47] praise the name of Allah if you want to
[55:50] get the daughter of God
[55:52] be a Son of God you want to be a Son of
[55:55] God you want to get a Son of God be a
[55:59] daughter of God and then the Lord will
[56:02] bring the right person
[56:03] so we see that in the days of Noah you
[56:07] know they were doing things
[56:13] they had challenges in marriage
[56:18] praise the name of our Lord and then now
[56:20] we sit still in the days of Noah
[56:23] there was an increase in the beauty of
[56:26] women
[56:28] we see the same thing today so these are
[56:32] precious
[56:33] and the Bible says in Luke chapter 17.
[56:39] foreign
[57:05] so if you want to know
[57:10] what is going to happen in our
[57:12] generation
[57:13] then you go to the days of Noah and then
[57:17] you see what happened in the days
[57:22] there were increase of people
[57:26] there was increase in the beauty of
[57:28] women
[57:29] there was you know people marrying from
[57:32] different things which they are not
[57:33] meant to marry
[57:35] people are decreased and then the Bible
[57:39] says violence increased on us
[57:44] see what has happened every week they
[57:48] are killing somebody innocence
[57:57] and you start wondering where is the
[57:58] world going
[58:01] because you're speaking bad about him
[58:06] see the madness
[58:12] they get somebody
[58:14] who has stolen a chicken
[58:18] and then they burn the person
[58:21] where is that coming from Days of Noah
[58:26] so the violence is so high
[58:29] that people don't have concerns
[58:33] they don't have natural affection for
[58:36] one another
[58:38] they don't have a feeling foreign
[58:56] you go back
[58:58] where is he going to take all that money
[59:01] oh you hear things somebody goes in a
[59:04] place and he chases away all the people
[59:07] and then he grabs hundreds of Acres
[59:12] going to grow their food from
[59:16] you see we are living in the days
[59:19] that people don't care about one another
[59:23] no more feeling for one another
[59:26] some days like it was in the days and
[59:29] then God said my spirit we are not
[59:32] Strife with man I am going to destroy
[59:36] the man that I've met
[59:38] praise the name of us but the Bible
[59:41] tells us in the midst of all the chaos
[59:44] in the days of Noah
[59:47] you have found favor before God
[59:50] praise the name of us in
[59:54] the minister of the chaos
[1:00:32] to come and dwell in your house
[1:00:35] and if the Holy Spirit has not been
[1:00:39] pleased to dwell in your heart
[1:00:41] then you need to seek the Holy Spirit
[1:00:44] and say Lord come down
[1:00:47] because you cannot overcome the
[1:00:50] pressures we have functions
[1:00:52] without the spirit of God
[1:00:54] you need the spirit of God
[1:00:57] overcome the challenges
[1:01:00] you need the spirit of God to overcome
[1:01:04] the generation of pressures
[1:01:11] that we see every other day
[1:01:14] on social media social media praise the
[1:01:18] name of Allah Facebook what's up what's
[1:01:22] up Twitter Instagram Instagram and they
[1:01:25] are now endless they are those from West
[1:01:28] Africa there are those from China
[1:01:31] then India India I don't know what is
[1:01:34] coming from Uganda
[1:01:36] foreign
[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:02:18] as it was in the days of Lords
[1:02:24] well we've read in Luke chapter 17.
[1:02:27] and then verse 28. as it was in the days
[1:02:33] look what the homosexuality
[1:02:36] the pressure
[1:02:39] that's a lover everywhere
[1:02:43] and it is taking over
[1:02:46] praise the name of Allah yesterday I was
[1:02:49] listening to some lady who is really
[1:02:52] fighting homosexuality
[1:02:55] and then you feel so bad
[1:02:58] praise the name of Allah but these are
[1:03:00] things that are happening in the
[1:03:02] developed world
[1:03:06] they are doing it and to them it is
[1:03:09] normal
[1:03:12] and then they are putting pressure on us
[1:03:20] praise the name of our Lord and these
[1:03:23] people don't have anything like reason
[1:03:25] or logic
[1:03:28] they want to force their thing on you
[1:03:32] when they were forcing it on Angels
[1:03:35] Genesis chapter 19.
[1:03:39] the first angels
[1:03:43] foreign
[1:04:03] to withstand such things
[1:04:07] to allow such things
[1:04:14] let us go to this message
[1:04:16] praise the name of our Lord
[1:04:19] in the message the Queen of Sheba mobile
[1:04:23] the prophet says
[1:04:26] let us got the message calling Jesus on
[1:04:29] the scene
[1:04:33] now while speaking commenting talking of
[1:04:36] him about what great things he had done
[1:04:41] after Revival fisting
[1:04:44] Jesus was probably resting like he is
[1:04:48] yes
[1:04:50] resting between revivals
[1:04:54] and they had been so clear identified to
[1:04:58] who he was
[1:05:01] the people knew who he was
[1:05:05] of those
[1:05:07] who he was blinding
[1:05:10] um
[1:05:12] but those who had a hold on the
[1:05:15] scripture
[1:05:17] because they knew what they knew that
[1:05:21] the scripture
[1:05:23] God's word has been given
[1:05:26] a lot you know
[1:05:30] to each every generation
[1:05:33] and that promise of that age has to be
[1:05:37] fulfilled
[1:05:39] and he fulfilled exactly what was
[1:05:42] supposed to be done in the time of the
[1:05:44] Messiah
[1:05:47] he met every qualification
[1:05:52] then we he was assured that he was the
[1:05:55] man
[1:05:56] now you see her brother Branham says
[1:05:59] that there is a lot
[1:06:02] there is a portion
[1:06:06] of the word of God
[1:06:08] that has been given to every generation
[1:06:13] praise the name of Allah even our
[1:06:16] generation
[1:06:17] there is a lot there is a portion of the
[1:06:21] word
[1:06:23] there is a the grace that God gives us
[1:06:28] to overcome the pressures that were
[1:06:31] living
[1:06:32] now if we can now get the word that has
[1:06:36] been sent in our generation
[1:06:39] then we are able to overcome in our
[1:06:42] generation
[1:06:44] we are able to be perfect
[1:06:47] in our generation when we can get the
[1:06:51] word that God has is allotted foreign
[1:07:04] but God has given us the message
[1:07:07] God has given us the message of the hour
[1:07:11] the revealed word of the time and that's
[1:07:15] the message that we need to live upright
[1:07:19] in this generation
[1:07:21] that's the message that we need
[1:07:24] praise the name of our Lord to overcome
[1:07:27] all the pressures
[1:07:30] so you need to make sure that you take
[1:07:34] time yourself
[1:07:36] standing the message that you have been
[1:07:38] here
[1:07:40] listen to the tips that we have what it
[1:07:42] is
[1:07:47] like I remember brother my love when I
[1:07:51] just got there University in my past
[1:07:54] year right now University he was of a
[1:07:56] great help to me yeah I know he was
[1:07:58] residing near Mercury University
[1:08:01] and every evening I would go to his home
[1:08:05] and when I was studying you know we
[1:08:08] didn't have many message books but I
[1:08:11] made sure that I go and borrow books
[1:08:13] from here
[1:08:14] check this message
[1:08:18] sometimes you find you don't want to
[1:08:20] lose the message
[1:08:22] you go and photocopy it oh yeah I
[1:08:26] remember I have many message books I
[1:08:28] photocoped and then I write down some of
[1:08:31] these things then I take it back to them
[1:08:34] how about us
[1:08:36] praise the name of Allah here we have
[1:08:39] message messages in book form we want to
[1:08:42] renewable we have them on our phones we
[1:08:47] have them on our iPads
[1:08:49] on our laptops
[1:08:55] how much time
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:09:01] do you put in the message
[1:09:04] you know but now you find somebody he's
[1:09:08] given a church age
[1:09:10] and it takes two years he has not
[1:09:13] finished
[1:09:18] this one we gave a church and then I was
[1:09:21] asking hey how many Church ages are in
[1:09:24] the book
[1:09:26] I think they are nine
[1:09:28] but the book said seven churches
[1:09:35] what is the first church
[1:09:40] think revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:09:43] then has that person read the books
[1:09:48] so is it a generation that we are living
[1:09:51] here is that people have tests for
[1:09:54] different things
[1:09:57] but if we don't invest our lives in the
[1:10:00] message that we have been given
[1:10:03] how are you going to know the workings
[1:10:06] of Satan
[1:10:07] how will you get the grace of God upon
[1:10:10] your life
[1:10:11] how are you going to overcome how are
[1:10:14] you going to be perfect
[1:10:16] in this generation
[1:10:20] I was reading about the generations
[1:10:23] according to the understanding of the
[1:10:25] world and it is very interesting how
[1:10:28] they wrote it
[1:10:30] so they were talking about that right
[1:10:33] now
[1:10:34] we are living in a generation Alpha
[1:10:37] today
[1:10:42] the previous one Global was Generation Z
[1:10:46] while you're moving and they called it I
[1:10:49] Generations
[1:10:52] people just care about themselves
[1:10:56] a centennial Generation
[1:10:58] Um
[1:11:00] and then before that one the Centurion
[1:11:03] this generation is it
[1:11:08] the one before that one was Generation Y
[1:11:10] or so
[1:11:12] why people were born from 1980 to around
[1:11:16] 1994.
[1:11:19] I don't know that they were asking why
[1:11:25] then there was Generation X
[1:11:28] then there was baby boomer generation
[1:11:33] and then there was a traditionalist
[1:11:35] generation
[1:11:38] and it was silent and so you see that
[1:11:42] science the world in its understanding
[1:11:46] every Generations have been changing
[1:11:51] they categorize a certain group of
[1:11:54] people
[1:11:55] and now the generation we are living
[1:11:58] even the little children now now to use
[1:12:00] the phone
[1:12:03] but I went the university without a
[1:12:05] smartphone is a smartphone and finish
[1:12:08] without a smartphone
[1:12:09] and this one which had buttons at that
[1:12:12] time
[1:12:17] wants to get it from um
[1:12:21] and they know where to foreign
[1:13:36] Revival in every generation
[1:13:40] he gives the opportunity for people to
[1:13:42] come to him
[1:13:45] so we cannot write up the people of this
[1:13:48] day
[1:13:50] that because they are failing in this
[1:13:54] still there is the elect of God
[1:13:57] in the midst of the pressures
[1:14:02] now in the message the queen of shebang
[1:14:06] the prophet says but then when he did
[1:14:11] that Spanish
[1:14:13] it usually blinds those who are blinded
[1:14:16] to those things
[1:14:18] it makes them worse
[1:14:21] but in every generation
[1:14:24] God has always had these agents
[1:14:29] praise the name of Allah his name is
[1:14:36] foreign
[1:15:09] [Music]
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:59] thank you
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:16:56] [Music]
[1:16:57] God always
[1:17:31] [Music]
[1:17:58] if God is
[1:18:01] think about things that are wrong
[1:18:03] if God is in here
[1:18:07] you desire the things that are pleasing
[1:18:09] to God
[1:18:11] praise the name of Allah how can we
[1:18:14] overcome how can we live perfect in our
[1:18:17] generation
[1:18:19] no one walked with God and as long as he
[1:18:22] walked with God he was perfect in his
[1:18:25] generation and now today
[1:18:28] wants to walk in now and as long as God
[1:18:31] is
[1:18:32] we are obeying him today we are
[1:18:35] following him then we are living perfect
[1:18:37] in our generation
[1:18:41] we are living perfect in Our Generation
[1:18:44] by the grace of God that he gives us
[1:18:53] that should be our utmost desires
[1:18:56] no this is my name is
[1:19:17] but in every generation
[1:19:21] every Revival brings forth some prophets
[1:19:24] of God
[1:19:28] Prophet is a preacher
[1:19:31] true preacher on the world
[1:19:34] that stays with the world
[1:19:36] and brings forth a Revival
[1:19:40] that God has the elect out of the
[1:19:43] generation
[1:19:47] and in our generation
[1:19:51] God has sent us a prophet
[1:19:54] praise the name of us you know the Bible
[1:19:57] says as it was in the days
[1:20:00] and many times when we are looking at
[1:20:03] the days of Noah we look at the floods
[1:20:08] but we don't remember that there was a
[1:20:10] prophet in the days
[1:20:12] there was a prophet in the days of Noah
[1:20:16] the message of God that delivered the
[1:20:19] election
[1:20:20] in the days so if we are living in the
[1:20:24] days
[1:20:24] and we have a prophet we have a message
[1:20:31] from the destruction
[1:20:36] even the days of Lord
[1:20:38] there was also a prophets
[1:20:43] now if you know that we are living in
[1:20:45] the days of love the question is where
[1:20:49] is the prophet of that day
[1:20:51] praise the name of foreign
[1:22:00] now when you see in the days of foreign
[1:22:09] God revealed himself
[1:22:13] praise the name of our Lord let us go to
[1:22:15] Genesis chapter 18.
[1:22:19] Genesis chapter 18.
[1:22:25] and then we read from verse one to
[1:22:27] Summer
[1:22:28] the Bible says and the Lord appeared
[1:22:31] down to him in the planes of memory and
[1:22:34] his and he sat in the tent Door In the
[1:22:36] Heat of the day
[1:22:38] foreign
[1:22:49] men stood by him and when he saw them he
[1:22:53] ran to meet them from the 10th door and
[1:22:56] brought himself toward the ground
[1:23:10] and said my Lord if now I have found
[1:23:15] favor in thy sight past not away I pray
[1:23:19] thee from thy servant
[1:23:21] age is
[1:23:31] let a little water I pray you be fetched
[1:23:34] and wash your feet and rest yourselves
[1:23:37] under the tree
[1:23:47] and I will fetch a muscle of bread and
[1:23:50] comfort you your hearts after that you
[1:23:52] shall pass on for therefore you have
[1:23:55] come to your servant and they said so do
[1:23:58] as though Hast said
[1:24:12] praise the name of our Lord so we see
[1:24:15] here that God appeared
[1:24:24] foreign then Abraham received the Lord
[1:24:27] he blamed me I needed something and now
[1:24:30] Abraham Ibrahim made him
[1:24:33] God yeah
[1:24:34] and then God
[1:24:37] asked Abraham yeah
[1:24:40] and they said unto him
[1:24:43] where is Sarah thy wife
[1:24:50] you know they came as strangers
[1:24:55] and then now they were sitting under the
[1:24:58] tree
[1:24:59] and then Sarah was in a tent behind them
[1:25:03] and then now they knew Sarah by name
[1:25:09] so God revealed himself
[1:25:12] to Abraham you know where is Sarah Sarah
[1:25:17] he descend
[1:26:16] and so also if it were living in
[1:27:15] vibrating and he declares your sickness
[1:27:19] foreign
[1:27:54] praise the name of our Lord
[1:27:58] and then we read in verse
[1:28:03] verse 38.
[1:28:07] then Jesus stand and saw them following
[1:28:09] and says unto them what seek ye they say
[1:28:14] unto him Rabbi which is to being
[1:28:16] interpreted Master where adrenal thought
[1:28:20] yes
[1:28:32] and he says unto them come and see they
[1:28:35] came and saw where he dwelt and Abode
[1:28:37] with him that day for it was about the
[1:28:40] tenth hour
[1:28:41] into never gamble Nevada
[1:28:54] one of the two which heard John speak
[1:28:57] followed him and Andrew was Andrew Simon
[1:29:01] Peter's brother
[1:29:03] foreign
[1:29:18] and sends unto him we have found the
[1:29:21] Messiah which is being interpreted the
[1:29:23] Christ
[1:29:26] away yes
[1:29:35] and he brought him to Jesus and when
[1:29:38] Jesus beheld him he's saying though at
[1:29:40] Simon the son of Jonah Thou shalt be
[1:29:44] called cephas which is by interpretation
[1:29:47] a stone
[1:30:05] so Simon comes to Jesus and then Jesus
[1:30:13] Jesus know your name but I even know
[1:30:16] your father
[1:30:17] praise the name of Allah and then he
[1:30:20] knows Us by name
[1:30:22] he calls us
[1:30:25] he knows us I pray there and the more
[1:30:28] you yield yourself to the world is the
[1:30:32] more you discover who you are before God
[1:30:37] he knows us so he was able to design yes
[1:30:44] morning and you are the son of Jonas
[1:30:48] praise the name of our Lord he was using
[1:30:51] the sign of the Messiah the way he told
[1:30:54] Abraham where is Sarah your wife the way
[1:30:58] he told Sarah why did you laugh
[1:31:01] praise the name of Allah so brother
[1:31:04] Brandon had the same gift
[1:31:08] so what was that gifting declaring
[1:31:11] it was declaring Christ
[1:31:15] being Among Us
[1:31:17] Praise the name of Allah it was the
[1:31:20] revealing
[1:31:21] of the son of man a woman they're
[1:31:24] revealing of Christ himself
[1:31:29] and we still have the same Christ amount
[1:31:33] working in our lives
[1:31:37] praise the name of our Lord to make us
[1:31:40] get into the stature of a perfect
[1:31:43] praise the name of Allah so the message
[1:31:47] that the Lord has given unto us
[1:31:52] if we can't believe it with all our eyes
[1:31:55] will make us get into the stage
[1:31:58] will make us be ready for the Rapture
[1:32:03] because the promise of our days
[1:32:11] is the Redemption of this
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:37] is there anything good from you know
[1:32:44] open it
[1:32:46] praise the name of it now each and every
[1:32:50] one of us
[1:32:52] God has chosen us
[1:32:57] are you taking time to tell people about
[1:33:00] the message that God has given unto us
[1:33:04] tell them God has given us a message
[1:33:08] this is what the Lord Has Done In Our
[1:33:10] Generations
[1:33:15] let the people know what you believe
[1:33:19] what hope you are
[1:33:21] so Philip told us
[1:33:27] Jesus told him yes
[1:33:31] there is no guy
[1:33:33] in verse 47. Jesus coming unto him and
[1:33:38] says of him
[1:33:41] beholden is in whom there is
[1:33:45] nothing else
[1:33:51] Jesus answered and said unto him before
[1:33:55] that Philip called disease
[1:34:20] you are the Son of God you are the king
[1:34:23] of Israel praise the name of Allah have
[1:34:27] you found Christ
[1:34:33] you need to tell another person
[1:34:37] then
[1:35:37] say that we have got foreign
[1:36:10] to make the choices
[1:36:29] and we have read about Luke Chapter 17.
[1:36:33] which says as it was in the days of Noah
[1:36:38] the days of Noah had several challenges
[1:36:45] we have them now to
[1:36:48] foreign
[1:37:14] Luke 17 30.
[1:37:17] when that's
[1:37:21] Sean is revealed
[1:37:26] so the son of man our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:30] has been revealed
[1:37:33] in our day
[1:37:36] praise the name of Allah he has been
[1:37:38] revealed why could it be revealed
[1:37:42] so that we believe him
[1:37:45] we receive him
[1:37:47] praise the name of our Lord we become
[1:37:50] part of him that's why he has been

[1:38:14] he delivers you from your weaknesses
[1:38:22] that's why he has been revealed to us
[1:38:27] in the midst of the pressures
[1:38:31] the
[1:38:34] same evils we are going foreign
[1:39:08] Revelations chapter 3 verse 14.
[1:39:12] praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[1:39:15] says and unto the angel of the Church of

[1:40:01] thee out of my mouth
[1:40:04] is
[1:40:05] [Music]
[1:40:11] praise the name of the Lord the Lord
[1:40:15] the time that we are living in the age
[1:40:19] that we're living
[1:40:20] the pressures of the day he says you are
[1:40:24] not cold
[1:40:25] you are not hot you have a form of
[1:40:29] godliness
[1:40:30] but you deny the power of it
[1:40:34] and then he says you testify I am rich
[1:40:40] I'm increased with God
[1:40:43] I have no need of nothing
[1:40:45] I know it's not that though outrageous
[1:40:59] Rich that's their testimony I don't need
[1:41:03] anything but then the spirit of God says
[1:41:07] you are rich
[1:41:09] you are miserable you are poor you are
[1:41:13] naked and worst of all you don't know
[1:41:18] the condition of the time
[1:41:21] the generation that we are living
[1:41:24] their testimony is a false testimony
[1:41:28] their worth is false words
[1:41:33] then saying I don't need anything
[1:41:36] is also false because it is as a state
[1:41:39] of Destruction
[1:41:44] but it's this time answering that it
[1:41:47] pleased God to send us a message

[1:42:43] then the Bible says praise the name of
[1:42:46] our Lord in second Timothy
[1:42:50] chapter 3 and verse 1.
[1:42:57] this know also that in the last days
[1:43:01] perilous times shall come

[1:43:12] in the last two days the time that we're
[1:43:16] living in the Bible is telling us
[1:43:19] dangerous times
[1:43:21] you see what's happening
[1:43:24] violence killing one another no more

[1:44:02] I'm thankful
[1:44:09] these same spirits that are in the world
[1:44:13] they also put pressure on us

[1:44:22] a lot of weight on us
[1:44:25] praise the name of it
[1:44:28] men shall be lovers of their own selves

[1:48:59] affection
