8 verse before we do that let's bow heads in order of prayer precious Heavenly Father we thank you we've come before your presence and we know we are welcome because of the blood of Jesus Christ your voice says come un to me all you who and heav and I give you rest father among us there are people that are depressed have got different needs they need rest from you so Lord as we read the word I pray that may anoint it to the need of the people in Jesus name amen so okay we are reading um 2 Kings 87 and Elisha come to Damascus and benad the king of Syria was sick and was it was told him saying the man of God is come and the King said take a present in thine hand and go meet the man of God and inquire of the Lord by him saying shall I recover of this disease so went to meet him and took a present with him even of very a very good thing of Damascus and and stood before him and say thy son Ben king of Syria has sent me to thee saying shall I recover of this disease and elishah said unto him go say unto him thou mayest certainly recover how B the Lord has shown me that he shall surely die and he setled this continent steadfastly until he was ashamed and the man of God wept you may be seated so you know the scripture says and Elisha settled his continent steadly until he was ashamed and the man of God we he sticks his face to you now The New International Version says he stared at him with a fixed gaze until has was [Music] embarrassed embarrassed so the man of God began to weep then the New Living Translation says became [Music] uneasy uney so the prophet when he looked atel became ashamed he became embarrassed he became uneasy he became uncomfortable there is something we want to pick out of that and say why we my Lord and he said because I know the evil that thou will do unto the children of Israel and I want you to know today that when Elijah was going out and he was going up y to take a new body he was stepping into theop there is something which happened God asked him to anoint three men one of them was then the next one is jeu and then Elisha himself when Elijah was going out he anointed three men so we go back to verse 12 and read it systematically and why we my Lord and El answered because I know the evil that thou shal do the children of Israel their strongholds wil thou set on fire and their young men wi thou slay with the sword and will th their children and rip up their children I mean their women with child just when you know they they are happy with child so for a title this morning I want to speak on the subject the body speaks the body speaks now the body has a language which is separate from the language of sound the body itself has a language has anybody ever come before you and before he says what he wants to say youve given him a seat to se but the body begins to speak and then you know this person here has come with bad news all he has come with good news this B speaks sometimes he speaks with the words of your mouth and sometimes he speaks alone you'll find people they speak their body speaks together with the words of their mouth and sometimes this B [Music] speak on their own so your body sends forth signals that originate from the brain cells it may move signs that signal [Music] happiness or shock orer or misy your body speaks you know you can get it State and somebody sends a message I have made at least about 500,000 for your [Music] birthday your body speaks so I want you to follow this subject very closely so these signals could come alone or could be escorted by sound like screaming in h all at least a smile so your body communicates so when King B of Babylon saw the hand write a judgment Amen on the wall the body reacted to the shock of his human Spirit the Bible says his continence was changed his thought troubled him the joints of his Lo were loose the KN SM one against another the body speaks either when it's got good news it will speak I mean it will react in a state of Happiness if you know it's bad news it cannot pretend to put on another expression so as many as we are here as many as we are here that is true to us all amen your body reports what's running through your spirit world and it does not require the sign of the son of man to tell what's going on you don't require a gift of discernment but you know there those things that l in the future of a man and sometimes you may not be able to point out those things but some people are gried by fear and they fear for what they don't really can be able to explain and so those things keep traveling a man's human spirit and if that man stands before a prophet he can pull out those things out of him are you together with me yeah the prophet can tell you that you are being troubled you've lacked peace of mind because there is something that awaits you up that's how God made a man that he has got special feelers amen if there is a danger ahead of you your body speaks because God made you in such a way that you have got what we call a sensor on the inside there brother tells us about the earthquakes that was hitting uh in India but before the earthquake came you know in India they build walls from stones and so there are some pockets and spaces where the birs can go and build their nests but before the earthquake hit these birds flew out and the animals they walked away from the walls because these have never fallen they in contact with their own God they really know something is going to happen and when ask what happened amen the people were C up into it but the animals the birs try to save themselves you remember the tsunami which hit Asia you know the animals and elant they were moving away from the rivers because they knew the flood was going to hit the what I want tell you is that when you are in the right standing with God your body will speak will speak good things if you are not in contact with God you'll always be troubled because you do not know what comes next so I want to say that you know if a man is in that state of depression and is not up about himself cannot explain what's happening to you I really don't know but I feel there is something in me now listen to me very well if you stand before a prophet like was stood before a prophet a prophet would pull those things out of the movements of your body amen you are unhappy you uneasy you cannot look you want look down a prophet will stand and pull those things out of I want tell you when brother Bram was meeting some people he would start talk to them and he says excuse me sir what's your name maybe uh you saw soon then he starts talking to them and he says I'm trying to catch your spirit because the body movement was reporting something that was not okay and brother Bram was a prophet he could get into the human Spirit of the people and pull out the secrets of their mou are you together with me and I want to say anointed preaching anointed preaching is the same anointing that uses a prophet are you together with me it's exactly the same anointing the anointing of a prophet and the anointing of a Preacher is exactly the same I want to give you a quote here from the message discernment the prophet says a new testament Prophet is a preacher if he's preaching not try to edify himself to make a big name or toedy his organization you see where I'm coming from he says such a man he under the same anointing that uses a prophet if he comes innocently and is only trying to preach the word try to lift himself to a very big level if he comes down surrender to be used by God is the same anointing with a Old Testament Prophet is the same anointing which Elijah had when he looked into the face of andel's body movement began to speak and the prophet cried say Amen somebody and then he says why do you cry my Lord then he begins to tell him I see you here that you are going to destroy the children of Israel and when you read a lot lower with what he had told him he came to a point and am I a beast to do things like that he was was not aware but the anointing had C sometimes when we come to church and we are preaching we preach in season and out of season there are certain things that are laid out in the future but the preacher catches them here and you who has some kind of a a different understanding you begin to say why is he saying that why is he saying that that's is's wondering why the prophet was telling him that but the prophet had seen the future so in the message the voice of the sign the prophet says anybody every preacher is a prophet because he for telling something preaching the word and inspiration is called a prophet but in the Old Testament they were more than that they were seers they were man who told things that was coming to pass and it happened so I want tell you this morning that the difference between the Old Testament prophet and the New Testament preacher is that the Old Testament Prophet would go a level higher to be a Seer so he would see but the anointed preacher he picks it from the word and presents it to you so I want to say this morning that as I stand here I'm prophesying to you amen when I say that God Is A Healer and you say amen God will grant it to you it's the same anointing amen the only thing between me and brother PR is because brother PR would look into your human spirit and he would tell you what was going to be amen are you together with me okay so as I stand here and I preach I can speak you into the future amen and if you are willing to take them God will bless you that's what a preacher is now let us go into the text and cause the title to stand out that the body speaks so when elij was heading [Music] out he anointed Three Men and he anointed them for a specific purpose if God anoints a man he doesn't give him a universal anointing he anoints him for specific purpose he can anoint me to be a teacher of the word and he can anoint another man to be an evangelist and one interesting thing is that everybody will only see the entire world by the picture that the Lord God has given him amen when he sits in front of the pastor he has to be so humble to be able to understand how the anointing of a pastor is working because the pastor is the father he handles the people with Grace but the Evangelist is a burning fire is you either take it or leave it so this is the way it works so he anointed elishah to be a prophet in his position because he was going away and he anointed be king of Assyria and he anointed je to cut off the family of ofab so two of these men which means je anduse the anointing are you together with me it's the anointing they receive put them in such a respectable position so now Elisha looks at and he says look at this man it's God who anointed him to be king look at what he's going to do with this he looked at him and he was embarrassed then the prophet cried it's a strange subject we have today but it's very important for us two of these men misus The Authority given to the ministry je was called to cut off the family of I mean of Ahab but he went beyond the purpose of the anointing and he destroyed thousands of men simply because they worshiped B he says how many are here who are I'm also one of them now I've been converted to B and all the worshipers of B they ran from all the other places where they went and they came into the temple and he told the people and he says look around if there is anybody here who doesn't was B put him out and they looked around and they said this one here is not a wor for bow this one here is not wor when they were out call these men bring the SW kill all these men don't spare anyone if you let anyone go he will be paid by your life and he killed people simply because they were Sinners but remember a sinner will always have his chance until he goes out of his life are you together with me God was not happy with him amen and in the future God cut off his entire family never to be exercised in the ministry again to be king over the land amen so he had some kind of a a a righteous indignation and there are so many people that take the pulpit and they go beyond there are many Christians who go beyond and they develop a righteous indignation but whatever anointing you have as a minister you are anointed for a particular purpose amen he had been raised to put down ahab's family from the king I mean from the Throne of Israel then has a man whom the sick Ben had benad had sent Amen to consult the prophet to see whether he would recover from his sickness is the man whom Elijah had anointed and the prophet told him that yes Ben would die he would not die but he will die he had seen him that he would not die by the sickness then later he said he will die God say unto him thou May certainly recover however the Lord has shown me that he shall die I want you to s that in a little bit you know it is not the disease that killed him but this man when he left the presence of elishah and elishah had looked at him and seen through his human Spirit he had seen him as a dangerous man amen so listen now he says after all the king said he would die so what did do when he got to King Ben he had to slaughter him have you seen because God says two things here one I was anointed to be king Syria the second thing then her would die so I would rather kill him now and I take thece but remember when David was anointed to be king over Israel he waited for his moment he did not go and H down for SA are you together with me so the prophet look at looked at hael and his body spoke without the company of words amen but as a prophet elishah bust out and cried at the body language ofel El he had settled his continent steadfastly until was ashamed amen and why wh thou elij said him because I know the evil that thou you will do to the children of Israel and then he began to break them down in four categories the strongholds will thou set on fire they young men thou slay with the sword and will Dash their children and rap up their women with child these two men here [Music] was anointed to destroy Israel but both of them did it can I be anointed and misuse the gift yes you can be anointed and you misuse the gift praise the Lord I want you to listen to The Prophet here he says if you don't think this is true just listen to this all over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing the business men they have invaded the pulpit without a call from God they have styled themselves the fishes of men and the founders of a move of God and they say the gift and Ministry of Ephesians 4 that God gave the church has failed so they are taking over here we are right in the midst of the Fulfillment of Prophecy called the gain Saints of K don't even know that they are fulfilling they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth may God have pity on them may their eyes be opened before it's too late they've got an anointing God has blessed them that whatever they touch turns into gold and they think okay since the church is moving slow we can also change our anointing and take it to the church and see what we can do this is now the misplacing of the anointing God has anointed you to be king of Syria but you destroy Israel God has anointed you to cut off the family of Je but then you are turning again to slay some other people when God anoints a man his anointing works best when he stands in his position of Abraham when God called him out and placed him in the land he would stand and kill a number of Kings as one man but when he go goes beyond the borders he loses the authority now this is where we say he has revealed un to us the mystery of his will every one of us should know what has God called me to do and what are my boundaries amen so God says I mean brother Bram says that's the same way the businessmen have gone so keep the anointing God has given you in the place he anointed you for because anointing misused it causes a death the Lord spoke when they were being anointed these two men he says anoint Je the son of nush shout thou anoint to be king over Israel anoint to be king of Assyria but now cross his line and his body spoke and the prophet him by his intentions amen let me show you something here when Jesus in The Book of Mark chapter 2 told the man that he said Son thy sins be forgiven and then the scripture says you know the Pharisees unsettled but their bodies spoke amen their bodies spoke and then Jesus says what are you debating within yourselves which is a hard thing to say that your sins be forgiven you or to say that pick up your bed and go are you together with me now in Jesus here was in the sameere spiritual height with El who entered into the mind of and again he also now Jesus he goes into the minds of the Pharisees are you together with me that you are debating in your mind the body spoke but the words did not come together with the body amen and immediately when Jesus perceived in the spirit that they reasoned within themselves amen he said to them why reason you these things in your hearts so when we come down to church then Minister stands in front of you he's ministering to speaking Hearts hallelujah hallelujah and if your heart speaks first then you can have whatever you have need of so what is your heart speaking this morning is your heart saying Lord I need to be an overcomer that's what you are going to take today is your heart saying Lord help me overcome this state of depression that's what you are going to take that's why brother Bram says when you come to church you get what you expect how many expect to go amen the Lord will grant it to you the only limitation I have is that I cannot see what you need but by preaching of the word the Holy Spirit comes directly to you to correct you to instruct you to teach you and when you take it that is your blessing praise the Lord sometimes as I said this body speak independent they speak independent of words listen brother Bram says let me just put in a word here from my own Ministry if you don't mind you all know that this gift in my life is a supernatural it's a gift where the holy spirit is able to discern diseases and the thoughts of men's hearts and other hidden things that only God could know and then reveal to me he's describing his gift I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of the people when Satan knows is going to be exposed are you together with me brother Bram says that their bodies begin to shift they begin to get unsettled he says I wish you could stand with me and look at the faces of the people I want to say it again the body [Applause] speaks praise the Lord the body does what it speaks now it isn't the people that I'm talking about it is that Satan has got a hold in their lives through sin indifference and disease but you should see their faces Satan knows is going to be exposed and the most peculiar changes come over the people's continents like the scripture says Elisha fasten his Contin on and he was ashamed do you understand why brother Bram would get those people in the prayer line they come stand before him and they begin to see the figting of their bodies the gift of a prophet would know who they were where they came from what their names were and then the prophet says that same gift is the gift of a Preacher except that he cannot tell you he cannot fore so brother Bram says there was aggressive movement of spirit among the people and the faces and body movements they showed and proved it praise the Lord certain kind of and little after that we see this man here the moment he leaves the presence of the prophet he goes and kills kills Ben it takes the kingdom it begins to invade Israel are you together with me there is something that I want to say to that when we come to church there is a state which we should overcome amen don't come with your baggage and you are determined to defend your bages no I don't like this man you defend your surrender yourself to God you don't come to a man you like you don't like you come to meet God and let your body say [Music] amen and if a minister says anything just amen because that's the same Ministry of the Prophet it would be the same like he was sitting in the meeting so brother BR are you together with me so when God speaks to the evil spirits they frown sometimes they tear up the people and they begin to scream amen praise the Lord but then I want to tell you also when God is speaking to the C Hallelujah the body will report back are you together with me somebody will lift up his hands and he say that is mine I receive it amen the man can even stand up on his feet to receive your body speaks when you come to the house of God if you contr your body will speak if you agree with God your body will speak the body speak amen it is who said let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and decare his works with rejoicing are you together with me so you sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and you decare his works with rejoicing are you together with me your body cannot be silent when God is doing something for you your body cannot be silent when God is speaking and prophesying you are a child of God that you are not going to fail that you'll overcome praise the Lord your body will come up to say amen I believe it are you together with me so while we come to church we should watch in prayer are you are you together with me because the moment you enter into these Gates you've entered into a Battleground are you together with me you can come to church with one evil spirit and you can leave the church with seven evil spirits because of the attitude it is scripture brother Bram told us when he's casting out demons they are looking for where they want to go oh my God Amen when they cast out demons amen from those paks there they were looking for where to go I when they were casting them out of the mad man of GAD they say we cannot operate without a body there's no way the devil can what without a body and when there was nobody that was ready to Habit them they said okay let us go to the pit and they went to the pit and the pigs R mad they could not think anymore and they landed in the water so when you come to church you've come battle you must know what you are doing praise the Lord you know I don't want to be called into a place where they are doing battle I don't know to take cover I don't know to do a camouflage and look like a vegetation you see I don't know and then these bombs are coming I will die because of fear and you come to church you have come into a Battleground Satan vers as God and this preaching here is dealing with the spirits brother Bram told us that when you are preaching these Spirits here you know when you are preaching the people they get even healed not even coming down here the Holy Spirit himself begins to do a surgery upon the people are you together with me so if you are not in your prayer if you are not in your right M and if you are negative you become habitation of those evil spirits brother Bram says many times you see them in different forms he recently here recently I seen one coming from a woman that looked [Music] like with big hairs hanging under his legs and so forth it swings coming right out they are evil spirits and many times it's someone looking over so beautiful on the outside could only look on on the inside of and see what it is then he says we are dominated by spirit and one time he was casting out spirits and the spirit here which was casting out was appealing to a spirit in the congregation which has got exactly the same attitude the same kind and let me tell you if it gets out of the other man it will look for that attitude and say it again you understand what I mean so when you come to church pray up father you have come into your presence I bring my burden it's not you who like to be what you are you don't like to that attitude because that attitude torments you amen you come to church to be a better person and so when you come to church open the door let the word coming amen and get to the center where your problem is and you say Lord I'm negative Lord I got an immun spirit amen I am so much of unth thankful don't hide your baggage you have come to a hospital you have come to be healed let your body language say thank you Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord I am being set free praise God on the day of Jubilee the Jubilee trumpet would sound and every slave would drop whatever work tool he has and today there is a jubilee trumpet that is blowing this morning drop every tool that the devil tries to put upon you and said master I want to go from here set free listen would have been saved if at that time he fell at the feet of the Prophet but he said am may fall at that moment he didn't know he was going to be a murderer right from that spot he went and killed King Ben be positive when God is speaking to so the demon mve to the people in service and the bodies would not keep silent about those movements so when these demons come they steal the minds of the people they will cause you to move out of church when something important is going to be said amen let me tell you your mouth can keep the secrets of the heart but your body cannot keep them praise the Lord you will never keep your secret your body lets out who you are amen you cannot say and say oh God bless you brother you can never put it up there will still be something reporting if you are very open God bless you it comes with the life it blows towards a brother it blows towards a sister Hallelujah it comes out life praise God Amen yes sir we don't come to church as a ritual amen we come to church to be set free this is a hospital amen you see when those Spirits begin to work the eyes will r the fist will the fist will amen not to fight but your body is going through a movement that you cannot hide the lips will quiver they will not speak easily something is reporting that something is not right the prophet looked him in the first to read all the Sid and the man got ashamed there are certain things that your actions will declare when ticus sat in the window when was preaching he did not fall out I mean he did not fall in he fell out he was at the boundary when you come to worship God come to the center of the real don't stay on the perimeter come to the center don't sit in the window are you together with me I told you one time many years ago young men who used to sit at FR saying praise God Amen Hallelujah hallu when they sat at the back I told you they are going out your will report amen come unto me all you I give you rest come to me Body Soul and Spirit whatever you do do it with the sincerity and the depth of heart amen when Abraham paid his time it was the Revelation that was paying the time right from the bottom of his heart and that thing kept going forth into Isaac the blessing entered ISAC the blessing entered Jacob until the scripture says paid time when he was in the ls of Abraham you come down here to worship God let the day you come to church bless your family bless your seed take something home with you praise the Lord on the foot of Mount amen Moses moved from the perimeters and came to the center Hallelujah hallu there is fire around here and the grass is not burning he doesn't S the perimeters he kept going until God told him hey hey hey don't come here stand where you are but the place where you are is a Holy Ground remove your shoes you come to a Holy Ground in the presence of the Lord and your body is still no sir wherever God comes down there is a posive movement there is a negative movement amen you cannot avoid praise the Lord so when the Lord saw that Moses kept drawing to the [Music] center God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here I am amen he was not hiding when the Lord does a roller call are you going to say here am I oh praise the Lord are you going to say Amen are you going to say Lord I have come to the well I cannot draw water by a vision I have to come to the center of the world don't stay on the perimeters come to the center and pick the blessing that God prepares for you in every service Moses says here am I and I am still coming and coming closer but God said draw not that's near enough praise God when a thir man wants to drink water he doesn't drink it by a vision that the water is there oh yes it is water no that man goes to the world you have to come to the world you have to come to the center of it amen avoiding let this bodies speak let me tell you when you avoid a special meeting your body has spoken it has spoken when you avoid a marriage meeting and you are married your body has spoken the body language something you love you can't avoid it amen avoiding communion is in itself a body language which is loud enough to speak to the rest of the Believers the body speaks your body never hides anything how can you stay away from the communion you are not busy and you say I'm not going to come the B has spoken but if you knew what it means let us go just First Corinthians 11 you come to the center when you come to Worship You diffuse into that presence amen if you want to say Amen you say very hethy one yes you have come to worship him that amen is not mine you are saying Amen to the word god somebody amen 1 Corinthians 11:24 and when he had given thanks he break it and say take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and then you say no I will not do it in remembrance of you why did you die for me after the same man also he took the cup when he had saying is the New Testament in my blood this do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me amen as a true Christian I cannot avoid the symbols that actually presentent my faith this doing remembrance of me the bread speaks of the body that was broken at Calvary and my body language speaks of my faith in the finished work of Calvary when I come to the communion night amen that the body was broken for me and that by the innocent blood of the Lamb of God I am now part of the New Testament the body speaks are you together with me your body you can never close it up is the best Communicator my body language must deare me as part of the New Testament and by Discerning the Lord's body many are healed at the communion table because they come with the heart and they come into it amen amen deep analysis of the Lord's Supper must be properly understood the doctrine identifies us with the Lord's day you just you know don't know this but it identifies you with the Lord's day that Master I'm going to be there I'll be one of them when you come with Bread and Wine I will be there he said I'm not going to take this until I come again so when you take it in remembrance of that promise you say when you come The Bread and Wine I'll be there are you together with me yes sir yes let's look at this uh Abraham he has that his backl brother lot had been taken [Music] captive amen by the forces of the world he goes into battle to deliver his and he pursued the Kings and brought back all the loots amen and also brought back a lot so what happens after the battle and I know you were in battle this morning yeah you've been in battle for quite some time there are certain kings that want to take you captive but Abraham comes here to do battle to deliver you would you say Lord deliver me from the different attitudes to deliver you from your family troubles it is here where you are canell the min hisory the preaching ising and when you take the councel it's an anointed councel amen and the Lord delivers you so now when lot I mean when Abraham was coming back from the slot of the kings in Genesis 14 verse 18 and king of Sal brought Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God so comes forth as both King and priest in the valley [Music] of Amen after the battle with the Kings but at the time M presented only Bread and Wine to Abraham he doesn't come and show him a crown because it is this communion that will take him to the crown hallelujah it's communion time it's Fellowship time with your God preparing to put on the CR amen because you stand as our priest as long as we are on this journey amen and the last message the last two messages is leadership and communion hallelujah hallelujah so as you do the communion you are celebrating the finished work of C without which there is no crown for you so how can you say I don't need the communion the scripture says and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the god possess of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which has delivered th enemies into thy hand and he gave him a of all blessed be the god the most high God who has delivered thy enemies into th heart under your control Hallelujah your control amen he gives you power and authority and he says blessed God who has delivered th enemies into thy heart Hallelujah he was blessing himself because he couldn't bless anybody higher and when he did that Abraham said surely I should pay my TI and he gave a of all and God who is the priest of Abraham's confession bless Abraham and by Revelation Abraham saw the final Tru of the crown and then he gave him a TI of all what does This Ti represent it represented the hidden truth that the Earth is the field and the Harvest of the field pays the ti to God so Abraham being a part of the good wheat which makes the ti of the Harvest paid the ti trying to say when you come as king I'm going to be part of your your body speaks when you reject the ti that my understanding my Revelation is limited so communion and ties speaks loudly so God visisted Abraham in numerous occasions but this vist spoke eternity because he carried a crown otherwise Abraham would not know that this m is the king of Sal are you together with me yeah he came with Bread and Wine Abraham eat some of this because are going to be Redeemed by the breaking of the body and the flowing of the blood take of this abah was identified with it in time we identified with it in reality if it brought God himself to Institute communion in type and Shadow then where is the reality but me and you coming to the Lord's table each time we practice it yeah we become that reality and then talk about healing coming down into the church when you come with sincerity to the Lord's table forgiving one another and saying Lord if I don't forgive I will never be forgiven no wonder when Jesus came he said Abraham rejoiced when he saw my hallelujah hallelujah he saw the day when is going to come back again with Bread and Wine in the coming Kingdom so my body language must run to the C amen not stay on the perimeter to the center fellowship with brow is a good body language it is a sign of life amen Before Peter started backsliding he had followed from the center and he always fought for the first class with and John would go and get into the the Master's you know BOS and when he writes about himself he says and the Apostle whom the Lord loves he knew that God loved he always it is me I'm I'm going to die for you Peter at the center when you see the people draw away from the center the body is speaking are you together with me let's go to John chapter 21 verse 17 Jesus said unto him the third time Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him Lord th knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee Jesus said unto him feed my sheep amen ver I say unto thee when thou was young thou guard thyself and walkest with thou West but when thou shalt be old thou sh stretch forth thy hands and another man shall gu the and carry the thouest not this Jesus spoke signifying by what Death Peter should glorify God and when he had spoken this he said that to him follow me I want to bring out something you very interesting in these scriptures then Peter turning about because he was told follow but remember there was a first class seat one time years ago I was traveling with my wife and when we were buying tickets the normal places were finished but I had to go some place and then my wife would come and we would meet in a certain place when I went to board the plane they started saying um okay they changed my seat and so I asked why did you change they said it's okay but I didn't know they had given us the first class so I missed it I've never been in the first class but my wife has so this first class here is very necessary when you're on that plane they begin to close the curtains you should not see the kind of food that the people in the first class why don't we fight for the first class and John fought for the first class then Peter turning about Jesus told him follow me since the disciple for whom Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said Lord which is he that betrayeth thee Peter seeing him says to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do because Jesus had told Peter follow me and then I mean John comes also says one want that's the church that's how Pastor suffer this one comes tells you this that one comes tell you this and both of them are strong what shall this man do Jesus says unto him if I will that etern I come what is that to the you follow me then went this saying abroad among the brethren that the disciples I mean that disciples should not die yet Jesus said notto him he shall not die if I I come what that churches with their battles this family guess that this brother against that brother don't mind it is very healthy it was in Jesus church at the top they work the first class how many of you would want the first class I do to be there and fed from fresh [Music] revelation God giving me everything that I pray for me an understanding that's not common to the rest of the I love the first but you see the body speaks when Peter started backsliding he preferred the lower class from the first class he didn't want the sent anymore inth 26 verse 58 Jesus is passing through his tribulations he being taken to be crucified the Bible says but Peter followed him far off to the high priest Palace and went in and sat with the servs to see the end the body spoke I've given up on that I had thought he would come and redeem Israel now look they Tak and I even cut the man's ear maned it so he started following from AF then while he was a f when they were beginning to talk Peter was that he wants to participate in everything so when they were talking he said you sound like one of them he say I don't know that man the moment you get away from the center you are not safe from Spirits you are not safe from negative Spirits they want to get a hold of and Peter denied him the first time Peter denied him the second time Peter denied him the third time and then Peter wept the body actions of Peter we're speaking about a backsliding man followed from AF sat with the palace servants his company had chained amen and finally he denied his Lord three times he was always among the disciples but he drew back so the Lord watches your body language and I pray that we may strike revival time may God send a Revival message to us this morning amen your negative mind your negative attitude your negative body language the sees it at the res go and tell my disciples and Peter are you together with me and God in his goodness got the weakest and made him the head of the disciple he made him the spokesman on the day of Pentecost so I don't care how you feel I don't know how far you've been following but the Lord is speaking to you go and tell my Ginger church and so and saw who alone knows his weakness that I still love him let him not fall from AAR let him come down to the center hallelujah hallelujah now upon the first of the we very early in the they came to the bringing the spices which they had prepared to spice up the Tom of a dead man but they found the Stone Road away they checked on the inside and they found him not and it came to pass as they were much perplexed behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye the living from among the dead he's not here his reason remember he spoke unto you when he was in Galilee Are you together with me so now listen to the power of the body language this man was following a far off and when Peter heard the news of the Resurrection he was the first one running to the center are you together with me look at those two languages following from AF and now he has heard of the Resurrection he's running up the front of everybody the age the AG did not matter at that time he was the oldest I mean disciple so absenting from service is the perfect body language because when Peter recovered the busy job the business job you know according to this and according to that it was no longer an issue the fear of the was no longer an issue are you together with me when you recover your body language changes words and the last Channel I mean the first channel of communication it's your body before the word comes out your body speaks am I right this morning amen so there is something that's unsettling the people the neurotic condition of the people testifies of it the world is gripped in fear no trust among people anymore parents don't trust their children anymore and the children don't trust parents the couples don't trust one another the bodies are speaking I'll to give you a quote here in the message Junction of time now brother sister listen what's taken place now we are at the end time we are going into the Millennium every hand pointing that way the old clocks is scking away about 2 minutes till mid omnipotence is speaking angels are speaking prophets are speaking prophets are prophesying Visions are being poured out the gospel is being preached the sick is being raised the blind SE the here impat here amen but speaks we are in the last day we at the last Junction this is the battle we are in the battle of the end Jesus rises up and these devils are coming up first area of attack is the Church of the Living God now the Church of the Living God is you as an [Music] individual he says men's hearts are Fring for fear perlex of time distress between the Nations the Earth getting so n it's bursting forth earthquakes everywhere Jesus says it would be that way be earthquakes in diverse places the Earth knows she's Doom she's nervous the world is nervous but the church is Raising in the gospel tued away with security he that cometh unto me I know why cast Hallelujah we are talking about body movement the Earth knows that it cannot be inherited in this condition so now what happens it is in movement it sees the Judgment coming the six se is coming earthquakes Flags different things the body speaks we saw it speaking the animals when the tsunamis were coming the earthquakes why is there such a fear among the people did not know but there was something coming why such fear why is there such a nervous why is there such a slackening of people why there is something happen friends listen there's oncoming storms of judgment so nature is a scared didn't know what was coming but the body movement spoke to the prophet that there is something not right with this man and that's why I must say this is the saving area staying in the word asking God set me free from what I don't see in front com let it not take me up say Lord have upon give me Grace we still have the blood at thear so you just ask God I want Wash Me In The Blood and the Lord will you don't have get scared amen of the the Lord's Supper the blood is present you need to get into the state of Peter that you catch news of the resurrected Christ and rush to the center if there is a church in ginger that is me that's what you should say so you ate either run to the center or you are doomed the group influence does not save you your group influence cannot stand with you because Peter the group influence was even wanting to betray him I'll give you this quote I'm finishing I will not be long from now the prophet says in India instead of having fces they have wars I've told you that already amen so you need to listen to yourself and run back to the center what's the negative in here let me run to the Center running back to the revealed Christ are you together with me yeah this Christ is not information this Christ is a manifestation of a living life are you together with me yeah run to the center run as long as there is time and say father I don't want to be this kind of man that I am Peter was as weak as you are but when Jesus has chosen you he can't throw you out and why throw yourself out why don't you run back to the center why don't you ask God to have Grace that you may have a Revival cycle again because the moment you get the Revival cycle your body will speak that's how good your body is amen yeah let me tell you we need to run back let me put in here the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him Revelation 1 and verse one do you love him friends amen Revelation 1 verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God God gave unto him to show unto his servant things which must shortly come to pass and he signified it by his Angel his servant John so the revelation of Jesus Christ dealt with in the Book of Revelation it is something higher than knowing the godhead amen it is higher than knowing the godhead which you all know if you just stop at the understanding of the godhead then that is information you need to come to the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servs and you also become the revelation of that Revelation amen it is Christ this Revelation is Christ carrying to us the entire disposition of God his nature character has revealed in Christ and his entire life has lived through the seven Church ages that is the revelation of Jesus Christ that we are dealing with today okay brother Bram says the Greek word for ration is apocalypse which means unil the unil is perfectly described in the example of a sculp unfailing his work of Statuary exposing it to uncovering revealing what was previously hidden amen it is now a SC here and he has hidden it but then he has to open it to the own Lu that's the revelation of Jesus Christ and for you to see him you don't stay at the perimeters you come to the CER and you see the revelation of Christ the end covering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it's the revelation of his works in the church which church is you yourself so the beaut of this is that we deal with the character of Christ as is going to be revealed in our lives are you together with me that's the unveiling of Christ you don't watch it from far you come to the center and then you say oh yeah oh yeah and the closer you come is more that power amen come over you influence you change you amen he knows how you are today he knows your weaknesses he knows your failures that should not keep you aake because he says come unto me I know you are heav I know you've got burdens but come unto me are you together with me will you come to the center this morning don't keep on the perimeters let your body speak that here I am Master oh hallelujah praise godah was like you but he stepped at the center amen and God had an opportunity to work upon his life and when God say whom shall we say Elijah said I am here you have washed me you have cleaned me youve made me perfect and my body is speaking Perfection the body speaks Isaiah was ready to go out may God bless you today with the POs body language I'm a Son of God and brought to the center God bless you brother Moses amen praise the Lord amen come to the center that's where you belong amen come come come unto me he calls you the way you are go tell my disciples and Peter hallelujah hallelujah I don't know how far far away he were was very far
