[5:11] Jesus is very
[5:15] near. Start to speak to the Lord. Dear
[5:18] Lord Jesus, we thank you father for
[5:20] Calvary. We thank you Lord Jesus for
[5:22] this time the privilege you've given us
[5:24] Lord to come into your presence Lord
[5:27] once again to gather Lord Jesus as the
[5:29] saints of God Lord Jesus Christ who have
[5:32] been purged Lord from their
[5:34] consciousness Lord who have been purged
[5:36] father from the background Lord Jesus of
[5:39] their parentthood Lord who have been
[5:42] Lord Jesus set free Lord God from the
[5:44] natures of sin Lord I pray Lord Jesus
[5:47] Christ as we put stray before you Lord
[5:50] as we come Lord put Jesus on your table,
[5:52] Lord Jesus, to dine with the king, to
[5:54] dine with thy holy angels, Lord.
[5:57] Sanctify our lips, Lord Jesus, and
[5:59] cleanse us, Father, from that sin of
[6:01] unbelief, Lord, that we may not be, Lord
[6:04] Jesus, like a
[6:07] we should not be, Father, like
[6:08] Zachariah, Lord, who doubted, Father,
[6:11] the ministration of the angel, Lord, as
[6:13] the pastor is coming to minister, Lord,
[6:15] let our hearts, Lord Jesus, open up,
[6:18] Father, Lord, to hear from the word of
[6:20] God and to hear from the spirit, Lord.
[6:22] As the Bible says, he has an ear. Let
[6:25] him hear what the spirit of God is
[6:27] saying. He that has an ear, let him take
[6:30] heed to thus says the Lord. Because thus
[6:33] says the Lord shall never fail. Lord
[6:35] Jesus Christ, we've forsaken all. We are
[6:37] like Peter, Lord Jesus. We have forsaken
[6:40] all, Lord Jesus. Our businesses, Lord,
[6:42] the neighborhoods, Lord, even the things
[6:45] pertaining to life, Lord. And we've
[6:47] come, Lord Jesus. We we have reserved
[6:50] them Lord to come into your sanctuary
[6:52] Lord to come into your presence Lord oh
[6:55] Jesus Christ and we know you gave them
[6:58] the promise you gave them Lord Jesus
[7:00] that you will never leave them and you
[7:02] will never forsake them and you said
[7:05] whoever shall come in to me I will in no
[7:09] likewise cast them out Lord your
[7:11] children have come Lord some are heavy
[7:14] laden Lord some are weak in nature Lord
[7:16] and some Lord Jesus Christ I'm full of
[7:19] Lord Jesus Christ. Oh God, body
[7:22] weaknesses, like sicknesses, Lord, like
[7:24] worries, Lord, Father, Lord Jesus, maybe
[7:27] tions, Lord, maybe rents, Lord, maybe
[7:30] Father, Lord, some have no food to eat,
[7:32] Lord, this night, Lord. But I pray Lord
[7:34] Jesus as they come before you Lord let
[7:37] them Lord consider you Lord Jesus the
[7:40] selfexisting one. The one who can fight
[7:43] their battles. The one who can provide.
[7:46] The same God who provided for Abraham in
[7:49] the strange land. The God who kept Jacob
[7:52] Lord Jesus when he he was on the way
[7:54] going back to his brother Esau Lord. And
[7:57] he said that same God who give me a
[7:59] blessing is the same God I will worship
[8:02] and I will give unto me unto him a
[8:04] tithe. Lord Jesus Christ. We pray Lord
[8:07] God that we may meet Father Lord Jesus
[8:10] that same pillar of fire which met Paul
[8:13] Lord Jesus on his way on Damascus Lord
[8:16] and Lord Jesus like those people Lord
[8:18] the saints we were walking farther going
[8:20] back to Emos Lord they were talking
[8:23] about Jesus they were meditating about
[8:26] his you know his disappearing his death
[8:30] and when it came to pass Lord you came
[8:33] and you came to strengthen them you came
[8:35] to comfort them. You said, "I will send
[8:39] I will ask the father to send a
[8:41] comforter, Lord Jesus. And you've never
[8:43] left us alone, Lord. We have the
[8:45] comforter, Lord, in our weaknesses. When
[8:48] the world goes astray, oh Lord Jesus,
[8:51] when the world goes astray for us, we
[8:53] are with the Lord. We are our eyes are
[8:55] open, Lord Jesus. Our hearts sing, Lord,
[8:58] to be like you, Lord. To have that
[9:00] nature of Jesus Christ, Lord. We know
[9:03] father as the bible says we are not yet
[9:06] what we are what we are meant to be but
[9:08] we are not father what we were used to
[9:10] be oh my jesus and lord a little by
[9:14] little lord Jesus we experience the
[9:16] change lord it may not come abrupt lord
[9:19] it may take father many years lord but
[9:21] anyhow father the change will come we
[9:24] pray lord jesus for your spirit of god
[9:26] to come into our mid lord to come lord
[9:29] jesus in our hearts to come Father and
[9:32] direct us Lord and teach us the word and
[9:35] manifest Lord and anoint the word which
[9:38] is preached Father to become Lord God
[9:40] alive in us Lord to be like Jesus
[9:43] Christ. We thank you Lord God. We give
[9:45] you glory and honor. I commit the
[9:47] children Lord who are still on the way.
[9:49] Father who are rushing into the church
[9:51] Lord may you give them may you haveen
[9:53] their feet Lord that they may rush in
[9:56] Father before the preaching of your
[9:57] word. And when they enter in Lord let
[10:00] them take father each one of them their
[10:03] own portion Lord Jesus that their hearts
[10:06] may be burn and father Lord Jesus that
[10:08] they may be strengthened Lord. Maybe
[10:10] sometime maybe they have been thinking
[10:12] of meditating upon you Lord and when
[10:15] somehow the pastor speaks about what the
[10:18] man has been meditating Lord it
[10:20] strengthen them. That's why we come
[10:22] prayed up Lord to hear from the spirit
[10:24] Lord. We thank you Lord Jesus. We give
[10:26] you glory and honor. I commit your
[10:28] children Lord once again. They have come
[10:31] before you Lord. They are ready to share
[10:33] with your spirit Lord. Lord Jesus like
[10:35] you said we are fellow hairers Lord. We
[10:38] thank you Lord Jesus. We give you father
[10:40] glory and honor in the mighty name of
[10:43] our Lord Jesus. Lord we pray. Amen.

[15:44] Amen. Let us pray. Father, we thank you
[15:47] for this evening.
[15:50] The grace that you've given unto us to
[15:52] come into your presence.
[15:55] You said where two or three are gathered
[15:57] in your name,
[15:59] they will be there in their midst.
[16:02] And Lord, we believe you are here.
[16:05] May you come, therefore, and bless us,
[16:07] Father.
[16:09] May you come and manifest yourself to
[16:11] us, Lord.
[16:13] May you come and meet every need of all
[16:15] your children, Lord.
[16:18] Even those who are not here, Father,
[16:21] take them also into your hands.
[16:24] that you may hear their prayers, Lord,
[16:27] and you may bless us all together, Lord.
[16:30] Speak to us the words of eternal life,
[16:34] and encourage us in the journey that
[16:36] still lays ahead of us,
[16:38] the glor of your name.
[16:41] In the name of the Lord Jesus, we grant
[16:43] us this.
[16:45] Amen. Amen. I greet in the name of our
[16:47] Lord Jesus Christ,
[16:50] let us turn to Johnapter 18.
[16:55] John 18 from verse 37 to verse 38.
[17:04] The Bible says, "Pilate therefore said
[17:07] unto him, thou a king." Then Jesus
[17:10] answered, "Thou sayest, I am a king. To
[17:14] this end was I born, and for this cause
[17:18] came I into the world, that I should
[17:20] bear witness unto the truth. Everyone
[17:23] that is of the truth heareth my voice.
[17:49] Pilate says unto him, "What is truth?"
[17:52] And when he had said this, he went out
[17:55] again unto the Jews, and said unto them,
[17:58] I find in him no fault at all.
[18:13] May God bless his word.
[18:16] You may be seated.
[18:19] So I want to speak on what is truth.
[18:25] What is truth?
[18:27] You know Christ was standing before
[18:29] Pilate
[18:32] and then he said, "I was born
[18:35] that I may bear witness
[18:40] to the truth." And then he told him,
[18:44] "Thatsoever is of truth
[18:47] hearth me." So then Pilate was asking
[18:51] him, "What is truth?"
[18:55] Praise the name of our Lord. And then we
[18:57] see that
[18:59] truth
[19:01] was standing before Pilot
[19:05] and then Pilot was asking the truth.
[19:09] What is truth? Praise the name of our
[19:11] Lord.
[19:13] So last week we had we talked about the
[19:15] spirit of truth
[19:19] and then next week God willing
[19:22] on Wednesday we shall be talking about
[19:25] the spirit of truth guides us.
[19:32] So now we want to talk about what is
[19:35] truth.
[19:39] Now truth
[19:43] You know I don't know I can start it
[19:48] but let us just use the scriptures to
[19:49] explain what truth is.
[19:54] Praise the name of our Lord.
[19:56] Now we see in the scriptures in John
[20:00] 17:E1 17
[20:05] the Bible says
[20:07] sanctify them through thy truth. Thy
[20:10] word is truth.
[20:15] Praise the name of our Lord. The word of
[20:18] God is the truth.
[20:23] So truth
[20:25] is a person
[20:28] and that truth
[20:30] is Christ himself.
[20:33] So you can't separate truth from Christ.
[20:38] So truth here
[20:40] is the reality
[20:44] you know the true being.
[20:53] Praise the name of our Lord. I want to
[20:55] see if we can approach it in two
[20:57] different angles here.
[21:02] Now in the message the Philadelphiaian
[21:04] church age
[21:10] He says,
[21:12] "Do you think says he that is true?"
[21:19] Now this word true
[21:23] is a very wonderful word.
[21:28] It does not mean true in the sense that
[21:31] it is the opposite of false.
[21:40] It expresses the perfect realization of
[21:43] an idea.
[21:54] realization.
[21:59] Now in
[22:02] Revelations 3 and verse 7,
[22:08] he says,
[22:10] "And to the angel of the church of
[22:12] Philadelphia, write these things says he
[22:15] that is holy, he that is true, he that
[22:18] has the key of David, he that openeth
[22:22] and no man shutth and shutth and no man
[22:25] openeth.
[22:29] 3:7.
[22:51] So he says he is the true
[23:04] Praise the name of our Lord. Revelations
[23:07] 19.
[23:09] And then verse 11,
[23:12] and I saw heaven opened, and behold, a
[23:15] white horse, and he that sat upon him
[23:18] was called faithful and true, and is in
[23:22] righteousness does he judge and make
[23:24] war.
[23:43] So just confused says but the Bible says
[23:46] true. He is true himself.
[23:51] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in John
[23:54] 14 and then verse 6,
[24:02] Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the
[24:06] truth, and the life. No man cometh unto
[24:10] the father but by me.
[24:19] So now Christ
[24:21] is the truth,
[24:25] you know, is the embodiment,
[24:29] you know, of all that is true.
[24:33] And then here we go back to the
[24:35] Philadelphiaian church age
[24:39] when he says, "I am the true
[24:48] It means that he is the reality
[24:53] not true as opposite of false
[25:00] you know like when we talk about false
[25:03] you think about truth
[25:09] but then the true what what is meaning
[25:11] by being the truth or the truth through
[25:14] here.
[25:18] He is the reality
[25:21] like now we would give examples
[25:24] when the Bible says Jesus is the true
[25:27] light
[25:31] you know the true light.
[25:34] So but we know we have the sun
[25:38] and then we have the natural the
[25:39] artificial lights we have here like the
[25:41] bulbs.
[25:44] Now these BS are just artificial.
[25:48] Then we have the natural light which is
[25:50] the sun.
[25:54] But then we can look at the sun.
[25:58] In the nature it is what we can call the
[26:01] original light.
[26:08] But then the sun
[26:10] is not true light
[26:14] because it was just made.
[26:18] It was made after a pattern.
[26:23] But when you read in Revelations chapter
[26:26] 21 and chapter 22,
[26:30] the Bible says that Jesus Christ
[26:35] will be the light of the city.
[26:40] He's going to be the light
[26:43] and then we shall have no need of the
[26:45] sun
[26:47] and then the city will have no day or
[26:49] night.
[26:53] We have day and night.
[26:56] So that means that the sun is not the
[26:59] true light.
[27:03] You know it is not the true light
[27:06] because it is time bound.
[27:13] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[27:15] you when you read in many scriptures
[27:18] like when the Lord Jesus was on Mount
[27:20] Transfiguration,
[27:23] the Bible says he was too bright,
[27:26] exceedingly bright
[27:31] beyond even the sunlight.
[27:36] Because a true light
[27:40] can never have something brighter than
[27:42] it.
[27:46] But then here we see that when Christ
[27:48] was transfigured,
[27:52] you know, he was brighter than even the
[27:54] sun.
[27:56] When he appeared to Paul,
[27:59] he was brighter than even the sun.
[28:03] Praise the name of the Lord. You can
[28:05] pick one of those scriptures here in the
[28:07] book of Acts.
[28:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Acts
[28:15] chapter 26 and then verse 13.
[28:22] It says, "And at midday, O king, I saw
[28:26] in the way a light from heaven above the
[28:30] brightness of the sun, shining round
[28:33] about me, and them which journeyed with
[28:37] me.
[29:05] Now you see that the glory of Christ
[29:09] was so bright beyond even the sun.
[29:14] So then he is the true light
[29:19] you know the true brightness
[29:24] praise the name of our lord. So when he
[29:26] says I am the true bread
[29:33] then he says that in the wilderness they
[29:35] gave them mana.
[29:38] But that man they would eat and again
[29:40] they would become hungry.
[29:44] But then for him what he gives
[29:48] it brings eternal life.
[29:52] So it is the reality of it.
[29:56] Praise the name of the Lord. So when he
[29:59] says I am the way,
[30:02] there is no other way other than Christ.
[30:06] When he says I am the life,
[30:10] you know we have the natural life here
[30:12] on earth.
[30:14] But then this natural life has death in
[30:17] it.
[30:19] This natural life you get tired.
[30:24] This natural life you know you become
[30:26] sick
[30:29] but his own life
[30:32] has no beginning
[30:34] and has no end. His very life
[30:38] is eternal.
[30:40] His life.
[30:42] There is no getting tired.
[30:45] There is no becoming sick. There's no
[30:48] becoming old.
[30:50] That is the true light. The true life
[30:52] rather.
[30:54] Praise the name of the Lord. So our
[30:56] lives see on us,
[30:59] it is just a shadow.
[31:02] Praise the name of the Lord. So then he
[31:05] says, I am the way.
[31:08] I am the truth and I'm the life. So
[31:12] being true
[31:14] means that he is the reality.
[31:18] Praise the name of our Lord. So let us
[31:21] go back in that Philian church age.
[31:24] He says,
[31:26] for example, we recall that Jesus said
[31:29] in John 6:32,
[31:38] Moses gave you not that bread from
[31:40] heaven,
[31:44] but my father giveth you true bread from
[31:47] heaven.
[31:51] John 15 verse1
[31:54] I am the true vine.
[31:57] Hebrews 9:24.
[32:01] For Christ is not entered into the holy
[32:03] places
[32:06] made with hands,
[32:10] which are the figures of the true,
[32:15] but into heaven itself.
[32:19] now to appear in the presence of God for
[32:22] us
[32:26] in first John chapter 2 verse 8
[32:30] because the darkness is passed
[32:35] and the true light is now the true light
[32:38] now shineth
[32:43] since this word
[32:48] expresses says perfect realization
[32:54] against the idea of partial realization
[33:01] as illustrated in these verses.
[33:06] We can now understand as never before
[33:14] contrast the ant type contrast this type
[33:21] and substance with shadow.
[33:26] Take the example now of mana from
[33:29] heaven.
[33:32] God sent down angel bread from heaven to
[33:41] but did not satisfy.
[33:46] It was only good for a day.
[33:50] Those who ate it were hungry again the
[33:52] next day.
[33:56] If it was left around,
[34:00] it would become contaminated.
[34:03] But Jesus is the true bread from heaven
[34:09] where mana was just a type.
[34:15] And if any man eats of that bread that
[34:18] came from heaven,
[34:22] he will never hunger again.
[34:26] He does not need to come back and eat
[34:28] again.
[34:33] The moment he parttook,
[34:37] he had eternal life.
[34:40] Here indeed was reality.
[34:46] No need any longer for a shadow.
[34:50] No need for a partial salvation.
[34:55] Here is the whole of it.
[34:58] Just like Jesus isn't a part of God. He
[35:01] is God.
[35:06] Praise the name of our Lord.
[35:08] So truth is Christ himself.
[35:13] So truth
[35:15] is a person.
[35:17] Praise the name of the Lord. In the
[35:20] message, do you now believe
[35:26] because that he knew what was going on.
[35:33] They recognized that his testimony was
[35:36] true.
[35:39] For God confirmed his testimony to be
[35:41] the truth.
[35:45] That's the way we believe these things
[35:48] is a confirmation of truth.
[35:52] Now you say what is truth.
[35:57] Christ is truth
[36:01] and Christ confirmed in a human life
[36:04] that makes it truth.
[36:10] Praise the name of our Lord. So when the
[36:12] Lord Jesus was standing before Pilate,
[36:17] it was truth
[36:19] standing before Pilate.
[36:22] Praise the name of our Lord. So when he
[36:24] was asking what is truth
[36:28] yet truth was standing before him.
[36:32] So when you receive Christ as your
[36:34] personal savior,
[36:37] You are receiving the truth himself.
[36:41] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[36:43] just need to open up yourself
[36:47] that that truth
[36:49] may continuously speak to you.
[36:53] Christ himself
[36:55] may reveal himself to you.
[36:58] Praise the name of our Lord so that you
[37:01] become a reality.
[37:04] you know, walking in the truth.
[37:08] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[37:10] should always be our desire.
[37:13] Walk in the truth.
[37:16] And Christ is the truth.
[37:18] And you know, Christ is everything that
[37:20] we have need of.
[37:24] Christ is the light.
[37:27] Christ is the life.
[37:29] Christ is the way. Christ is everything
[37:32] we have need of.
[37:36] But then the way we receive Christ
[37:39] is not by hearing the word of God.
[37:44] And now when you hear the word of God,
[37:47] obey the word of God.
[37:50] And when you are obedient to the word of
[37:52] God,
[37:54] the life of Christ himself,
[37:57] which is the Holy Spirit
[38:00] comes down in your life
[38:03] and then you also become a dwelling
[38:05] place of the truth
[38:10] and that should be the reason why we got
[38:12] saved.
[38:14] You got saved that God can live in you.
[38:20] God can dwell in your life.
[38:23] No longer you that live,
[38:26] but Christ that lives in you.
[38:31] Praise the name of our Lord. That should
[38:33] be always our desire.
[38:36] Walk in the word.
[38:38] Walk in the spirit. You know, you are
[38:41] yielding yourself.
[38:43] Praise the name of our Lord. To the word
[38:46] of God.
[38:47] I read this quote in the morning
[38:51] during our morning exaltations.
[38:56] Praise the name of our Lord. I certainly
[38:58] encourage every one of you to be
[38:59] listening to these daily exitations on
[39:01] the church age book.
[39:07] You know we read one page or two pages
[39:10] or three and then try to throw more
[39:12] light on it.
[39:21] So you take time and listen to these
[39:23] things.
[39:25] Praise the name of our Lord so that you
[39:27] can spiritually be built.
[39:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Don't be
[39:36] too busy.
[39:39] Not to maybe put 20 minutes aside or 30
[39:42] minutes aside.
[39:46] Or maybe you say I don't have data.
[39:51] But then you have data of Tik Tok.
[39:55] You have rumor mongering around
[40:01] that seeing some videos somewhere
[40:03] Facebook
[40:08] said that is too much for me.
[40:12] So just take time and listen to things
[40:15] on daily basis.
[40:19] So in the church age book
[40:23] page 108
[40:27] under the Ephesian church age.
[40:31] He says God's intention for his creation
[40:38] man is to express his words.
[40:44] In Genesis,
[40:46] Adam was given the word to live by.
[40:58] A life by the word
[41:11] would be the word expressed.
[41:19] So now he says Adam was given to live by
[41:22] the word.
[41:25] We know there was the tree of life and
[41:27] then the tree of knowledge of good and
[41:29] evil.
[41:34] And then the tree of life was the Lord
[41:36] Jesus Christ himself.
[41:39] And then the tree of knowledge of good
[41:41] and evil
[41:43] was Satan.
[41:46] Now man is meant to live by every word
[41:52] that comes out of the mouth of God.
[41:56] So they were meant to live by the word
[41:58] of God.
[42:02] What the word of God was telling them
[42:07] meant to live in the garden of Eden.
[42:11] Now, brother Brham is telling us
[42:15] that if we live by the word of God,
[42:19] you are obedient to the word.
[42:23] When you obey the word, you know, you're
[42:26] doing what the word is telling you to
[42:27] do.
[42:30] Then you are expressing that word.
[42:34] You are manifesting that word.
[42:38] And that's what the whole thing of our
[42:40] salvation is about.
[42:44] That we can express the word of God in
[42:46] our lives.
[42:49] You express the word of God at your
[42:52] place of work.
[42:55] You may express the word of God at where
[42:57] you stay.
[43:01] So then it will be Christ living in you.
[43:06] Praise the name of our Lord. The truth
[43:10] which is the word of God
[43:13] should be believed
[43:20] and then express it.
[43:27] Praise the name of our Lord. Amen. You
[43:29] know like like we in the time of
[43:31] politics
[43:34] and so now every every I think it was
[43:37] yesterday the other day
[43:40] I saw people of N holding the umbrella
[43:43] walking in town when it was shining but
[43:45] were holding the umbrella
[43:48] they expressing themselves
[43:51] and then those ones who have different
[43:53] kind of symbols
[43:57] like now those of DP would have I think
[43:59] it was a
[44:02] So they would carry a and said
[44:03] this is what we are
[44:07] you know they are expressing who they
[44:09] are.
[44:11] So even us as Christians
[44:14] our life should express that we are
[44:16] Christians.
[44:18] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[44:21] talk at your place of work
[44:24] you know when you you conduct yourself
[44:26] at place of work
[44:30] You know, you should do everything to
[44:32] reflect the image of Jesus Christ.
[44:36] As a Christian,
[44:38] there is unexpected conduct that you are
[44:40] meant to behave.
[44:44] Praise the name of our Lord. So then you
[44:46] have to express the truth
[44:49] and you have to live the life thereof.
[44:54] So he says that is true.
[44:58] But did Adam live by that word?
[45:05] No. Because
[45:07] he was to live by every word
[45:13] and he failed to take every word.
[45:18] But here God wants us to live by every
[45:21] word.
[45:26] Then there arose Moses.
[45:30] What a great and mighty man he was.
[45:34] Yet he also failed to live by everyone.
[45:39] And that prophet,
[45:41] the type of the great prophet to come,
[45:47] failed in anger to obey the word.
[45:52] And there came also David,
[45:56] the great king of Israel,
[45:59] a man after God's own heart,
[46:03] he fell by adultery,
[46:06] when he was tempted.
[46:09] But eventually
[46:11] in the fullness of time,
[46:16] there came one,
[46:19] the head
[46:21] Even Jesus
[46:23] who also must be tempted to see if he
[46:25] would live by every word
[46:36] that proceed out of the mouth of God.
[46:40] Then he was then was Satan foiled.
[46:47] For here was one who lived. It is
[46:50] written
[46:54] and the masterpiece of God
[46:59] overcame by reflecting God's word.
[47:06] Then was this manifested perfect one
[47:08] given to the cross
[47:18] as the perfect lamb of God
[47:22] for the perfect sacrifice.
[47:26] And on the tree
[47:29] he received the wounds unto death.
[47:33] And we by him and because of him might
[47:36] eat of the tree of life.
[47:40] And then that life freely given would
[47:42] enable us to overcome
[47:47] and express the word of God.
[47:52] Praise the name of the Lord. Our
[47:54] overcoming
[47:56] comes from Christ.
[47:59] When we partake of the word,
[48:02] when we partake of the truth,
[48:05] when Christ lives in us,
[48:08] he gives us the ability
[48:11] to overcome all temptations.
[48:14] Praise the name of our Lord. He gives us
[48:16] the ability
[48:18] to reflect the truth
[48:21] which is the word of God.
[48:24] And you know if you are living in the
[48:26] truth, praise the name of our Lord, you
[48:29] know you have denounced the things of
[48:31] dishonesty.
[48:35] You have denounced the things that are
[48:37] crafty.
[48:40] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[48:42] in other words, you are walking in a
[48:44] straight line before God.
[48:49] You are living upright.
[48:52] Praise the name of our Lord.
[48:54] being righteous before God.
[48:58] And that should be our desire every day
[49:02] that when we receive the truth
[49:05] which is Christ, he comes and makes us
[49:08] live in that same truth.
[49:13] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[49:15] to first John chapter 1 verse one.
[49:22] The scripture says
[49:25] that which was from the beginning, which
[49:28] we have heard, which we have seen with
[49:30] our eyes, which we have looked upon and
[49:33] our hands have handled of the word of
[49:36] life.
[49:57] John is saying
[50:00] that which was from the beginning.
[50:04] Then he says which we heard
[50:10] and we didn't stop at hearing it
[50:14] but then we what we heard at the
[50:16] beginning
[50:19] it became seen by our eyes.
[50:25] We looked upon that.
[50:28] Then he says our hands handled
[50:34] the word of life.
[50:37] So he's talking about the person
[50:40] we had who was there in the beginning
[50:45] and then the prophets were talking about
[50:47] him in the scriptures
[50:50] and then that the prophet was talking
[50:52] about
[50:55] became manifested here on earth.
[50:58] And then John says, "We saw him.
[51:02] We heard about him. But now we see him.
[51:07] We look upon him.
[51:09] We associate with him physically
[51:16] and then we hear him and then he says it
[51:20] is the word of life."
[51:23] So now the word of life is not just a
[51:27] mere sound
[51:30] is not just a mere letter written
[51:34] but the word of life is the person of
[51:38] Christ himself
[51:40] who was the manifestation of God.
[51:45] God in human life.
[51:48] So that is what was standing before
[51:50] Herod.
[51:53] It is the one who was standing before
[51:55] Pilate.
[51:58] That's the one who was moving with the
[51:59] apostles.
[52:02] But then he told them in the form that I
[52:06] am in.
[52:08] It is good for you that I go away.
[52:13] Before I don't go away,
[52:16] then the comforter shall not come.
[52:20] the spirit of truth.
[52:22] Now the comforter
[52:25] is the spirit of truth
[52:28] and is the holy spirit,
[52:31] Christ himself,
[52:33] not the third person of the trinity.
[52:38] It is the very God who created the
[52:40] heaven and earth
[52:43] who express himself as the father in the
[52:46] old testament
[52:50] and then he express himself as the son
[52:52] in the four gospels
[52:56] and then he expresses himself as the
[52:58] holy spirit
[53:01] from the book of acts up to this time.
[53:06] So when we receive the baptism of the
[53:08] Holy Spirit,
[53:11] we are not receiving a third person of
[53:14] the Trinity,
[53:18] but we are receiving the very life of
[53:21] God,
[53:24] God himself
[53:26] who put on the human flesh
[53:29] and he put that body on the cross.
[53:33] That's why the Bible says
[53:36] in Acts chapter 20
[53:39] and then verse 28,
[53:43] he says, "Take heed therefore unto
[53:46] yourselves unto all the flock over which
[53:49] the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to
[53:52] feed the church of God which he has
[53:55] purchased with his own blood.
[54:15] So he says the Holy Spirit
[54:19] has made you overseers.
[54:22] And then he says the church of God.
[54:26] And then he says which is purchased by
[54:29] God his own blood. guarantee
[54:33] but who shed the blood. It was Jesus
[54:36] Christ, God in human form.
[54:40] Then when he resurrected
[54:43] on the day of Pentecost, he comes down
[54:45] as the Holy Spirit
[54:49] and then he embodies people,
[54:52] you know, he gets into the human bodies,
[54:57] Christ living in us.
[55:01] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[55:03] should always be our desire.
[55:07] Lord, live in me.
[55:09] So here John is saying we have handled
[55:11] of the word of life.
[55:15] For the life was manifested in John 1
[55:17] John 1:2.
[55:20] For the life was manifested and we have
[55:23] seen it. and bear witness and show unto
[55:26] you that eternal life which was with the
[55:29] Father and was manifested unto us.
[55:51] Praise the name of the Lord. This
[55:54] eternal life which was with the father
[55:57] was manifested to us.
[56:01] How? In the person of Jesus Christ.
[56:06] So Jesus Christ is eternal life himself.
[56:11] Praise the name of our Lord. the way he
[56:13] is the truth himself.
[56:16] He is the eternal life himself.
[56:20] He is the eternal life himself.
[56:23] He is the word of God himself.
[56:27] So you can't separate any of these
[56:30] things from Christ.
[56:33] He is the truth.
[56:37] He is the life.
[56:41] He is the word
[56:44] and he is the spirit of God.
[56:48] Praise the name of our Lord. So what is
[56:51] truth?
[56:52] It is Christ himself.
[56:55] Praise the name of our Lord. So now when
[56:58] you receive the truth,
[57:00] you are receiving Christ.
[57:03] When you obey the truth, you are obeying
[57:06] Christ.
[57:08] Praise the name of our Lord.
[57:10] That same Christ as you receive him,
[57:14] you know, allow him to become more and
[57:17] more in you.
[57:21] Allow him to take over all your life.
[57:25] He takes over your thinking.
[57:28] He takes over, you know, your speech or
[57:30] your testimony.
[57:34] He takes over your livelihood,
[57:37] your conduct.
[57:39] everything being fleshed by Christ
[57:41] himself.
[57:44] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[57:46] says in verse three,
[57:48] that which we have seen and heard
[57:50] declare we unto you that ye also may
[57:54] have fellowship with us. And truly our
[57:57] fellowship is with the Father and with
[57:59] his son Jesus Christ.
[58:10] [Music]
[58:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[58:26] to be in that continuous fellowship.
[58:31] Praise the name of our Lord with Christ.
[58:34] Let us go to John 1:7.
[58:40] The Bible says,
[58:42] "The same came for a witness to bear a
[58:45] witness of the light that all men
[58:48] through him might believe.
[59:00] He was not that light but was sent to
[59:04] bear witness of that light.
[59:14] That was the true light which lightth
[59:17] every man that cometh into the world.
[59:27] So the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:30] is the true light
[59:33] and the Bible says in him is no
[59:37] darkness.
[59:39] Now that light
[59:42] where the Bible says in John 1 verse one
[59:47] in the beginning was the word and the
[59:49] word was with God.
[59:54] is the true light.
[59:57] That same word is the truth.
[1:00:01] And then that same word
[1:00:04] became flesh.
[1:00:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Put on a
[1:00:09] body.
[1:00:11] Praise the name of our Lord. Come and
[1:00:14] redeem us.
[1:00:16] So now the Bible says and the word was
[1:00:20] made flesh.
[1:00:22] and dwelt among us.
[1:00:25] And we beheld his glory
[1:00:29] as the glory of the only begotten
[1:00:34] full of grace and truth.
[1:00:40] So grace and truth,
[1:00:43] the Bible says comes by the Lord Jesus
[1:00:46] Christ himself.
[1:00:49] That's what the scripture says in verse
[1:00:52] 16.
[1:00:54] And of his fullness have we all received
[1:00:58] grace for grace.
[1:01:08] For the law was given by Moses, but
[1:01:11] grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[1:01:22] So Christ is the embodiment of grace of
[1:01:25] God and the truth.
[1:01:36] that we have need of
[1:01:39] is in Christ. Praise the name of our
[1:01:42] Lord. So then you need just to open up
[1:01:46] and then have a personal relationship
[1:01:49] with Christ.
[1:01:52] Praise the name of our Lord. If you have
[1:01:54] accepted the Lord Jesus as your personal
[1:01:56] savior,
[1:01:59] be obedient to him all the way.
[1:02:03] Water baptism, you go and do it. obeying
[1:02:07] the word, you go and do it.
[1:02:10] Then you see that the life of Jesus
[1:02:13] Christ
[1:02:15] is formed in you.
[1:02:18] So that you are no longer living by
[1:02:20] yourself,
[1:02:23] but it is Christ that lives in you.
[1:02:27] Praise the name of the Lord. Let us go
[1:02:30] to Colossians chapter 3
[1:02:33] and then verse one.
[1:02:38] Colossians 3:1,
[1:02:42] "If you be risen with Christ, seek those
[1:02:45] things which are above, where Christ
[1:02:47] siteth on the right hand of God.
[1:03:05] He says if you are risen with Christ
[1:03:09] then your desires should be those things
[1:03:14] that are above. In other words, you
[1:03:17] desire more of God in your life.
[1:03:20] The things of God make you happy.
[1:03:25] Like David when he had let us go into
[1:03:28] the house of God.
[1:03:31] He said I was glad when they said that
[1:03:33] let us go into the house of God.
[1:03:38] The things that pertain to the kingdom
[1:03:40] of God
[1:03:42] will always make you very happy
[1:03:46] will always excite you. You will take
[1:03:50] time to listen to them.
[1:03:52] You'll always try to see that you follow
[1:03:54] those things after God.
[1:03:58] So then he says, "Seek those things
[1:04:00] which are above
[1:04:03] where Christ siteth on the right hand of
[1:04:05] God
[1:04:09] because you have a passion of them.
[1:04:13] You know, you have such a longing
[1:04:17] because you are connected there.
[1:04:21] And when you are born from above,
[1:04:24] you'll always desire the things that are
[1:04:27] comfortable.
[1:04:30] You desire the things that are true.
[1:04:34] Then set your affection on the things
[1:04:36] above,
[1:04:40] not on the things on earth.
[1:04:43] So then your mind is always on the word
[1:04:46] of God.
[1:04:48] How you can obey the word of God.
[1:04:51] how you desire more of God to be
[1:04:53] revealed to you
[1:04:56] to see that you are in constant
[1:04:58] fellowship.
[1:05:01] Praise the name of our Lord with the
[1:05:03] spirit of God. Then he says, "For you
[1:05:07] are dead and your life is hid with
[1:05:09] Christ in God."
[1:05:16] That means that the sins of this world
[1:05:20] They mean little to you,
[1:05:23] you know. They are just like you can
[1:05:26] look at it if it is there well and if
[1:05:28] it's not there still you are not
[1:05:30] troubled about it.
[1:05:35] Praise the name of the Lord. Because you
[1:05:37] are connected up in heaven.
[1:05:40] Your desires are the things above.
[1:05:44] Praise the name of the Lord. So the
[1:05:46] things of this life are so temporary to
[1:05:48] you.
[1:05:51] You are more mindful about the things in
[1:05:53] heaven.
[1:05:55] Praise the name of our Lord. When Christ
[1:05:58] who is our life shall appear, then shall
[1:06:00] he also appear with him in glory.
[1:06:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Christ
[1:06:12] becomes your life.
[1:06:15] He he settles into you.
[1:06:19] You know, you become the manifestation
[1:06:21] of Christ.
[1:06:24] And that should always be our desire,
[1:06:28] the truth living in us,
[1:06:31] desiring more of God.
[1:06:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Even your
[1:06:36] life
[1:06:38] reflects the truth.
[1:06:40] Your speech, it reflects the truth.
[1:06:45] Your walk reflects the truth. Praise the
[1:06:49] name of our Lord. You know, you are you
[1:06:51] are not afraid
[1:06:53] or maybe somebody's not afraid about you
[1:06:57] because you will walk and manifest that
[1:07:00] same truth that is in you.
[1:07:04] Praise the name of the Lord. In the
[1:07:06] message adoption,
[1:07:09] he says, "What is truth?
[1:07:12] The word of God.
[1:07:15] Is that right? John 17:17.
[1:07:20] He say, "Sanctify them father through
[1:07:22] thy truth.
[1:07:25] Thy word is truth.
[1:07:28] What was the salvation was trying to
[1:07:30] tell them?
[1:07:34] Predestinated before the foundation of
[1:07:36] the earth
[1:07:39] to adoption of sons,
[1:07:42] predestinated to eternal life.
[1:07:46] Now, after you come into eternal life,
[1:07:50] after you've been saved,
[1:07:52] sanctified,
[1:07:55] filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:07:57] you are sons,
[1:08:00] now God wanting to place you positionary
[1:08:05] so that you can work for his kingdom and
[1:08:07] his glory.
[1:08:12] That is the gospel.
[1:08:14] Being fast,
[1:08:16] hear the word.
[1:08:18] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:08:20] Jesus Christ
[1:08:23] for the remission of your sins,
[1:08:26] taking away your sins,
[1:08:28] calling on the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:31] Christ,
[1:08:33] for the promised land.
[1:08:36] The promise is unto every soj that's on
[1:08:39] your road.
[1:08:48] If you left your home tonight a sinner
[1:08:52] saying, "I will walk over to the Brham
[1:08:54] tabernacle.
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:08:59] God gives you the opportunity tonight.
[1:09:03] There is one thing lays between you and
[1:09:06] the promised land.
[1:09:11] What is the promised land?
[1:09:14] The Holy Ghost. What laid between Joshua
[1:09:17] and the promised land was Jordan.
[1:09:24] Exactly right.
[1:09:26] Moses being a type of Christ
[1:09:31] led the children up to the promised
[1:09:32] land.
[1:09:36] Moses did not take the children in the
[1:09:37] promised land.
[1:09:40] Joshua took the people in and divided up
[1:09:43] the land.
[1:09:47] Jesus paid the price,
[1:09:50] led them up to the Holy Spirit.
[1:09:54] God sent the Holy Spirit down
[1:09:58] and he positionally put the church in
[1:10:01] order.
[1:10:06] each man
[1:10:08] filling him with his presence of his
[1:10:10] being.
[1:10:15] You see what I mean?
[1:10:17] All in Christ Jesus.
[1:10:21] How God predestinated this to the
[1:10:23] calling of this gospel.
[1:10:29] Praise the name of Lord. So you see it
[1:10:31] is the Lord himself working out your
[1:10:34] salvation.
[1:10:37] allow him to lead you all through the
[1:10:39] way.
[1:10:41] Praise the name of our Lord. He saves
[1:10:44] you. He justifies you.
[1:10:48] He sanctifies you. He fills you with the
[1:10:51] Holy Spirit.
[1:10:53] And he positionally places you in the
[1:10:55] body of Jesus.
[1:10:58] And each of us in the body of Jesus
[1:10:59] Christ,
[1:11:02] we have a work to do in the kingdom of
[1:11:04] God.
[1:11:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Each and
[1:11:08] every one of us. There is a purpose of
[1:11:11] God.
[1:11:13] He has saved you that you may serve him
[1:11:16] in his kingdom.
[1:11:19] Praise the name of our Lord. Each and
[1:11:21] every one of us. You are a witness at
[1:11:24] your place of work
[1:11:26] about the living God.
[1:11:29] When they see you, that's what the Bible
[1:11:32] says.
[1:11:34] Let your light so shine before all.
[1:11:39] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:11:42] In the book of Matthew,
[1:11:44] as I try to finish,
[1:11:53] Matthew chapter 5,
[1:11:58] he says
[1:12:00] verse 13,
[1:12:03] You are the salt of the earth. But if
[1:12:05] the salt have lost its favor, where
[1:12:07] wither or shall it be salted? It is
[1:12:10] forth good for nothing but to be cast
[1:12:14] out and to be trodden under the foot of
[1:12:16] men.
[1:12:37] You are the light of the world. A city
[1:12:39] that is set on a hill cannot be hid.
[1:12:59] Neither do men light a candle and put it
[1:13:01] under the bushell, but on a candlestick,
[1:13:04] and it giveth light upon all that are in
[1:13:07] the house.
[1:13:24] Let your light so shine before men that
[1:13:28] they might see your good works and
[1:13:30] glorify your father which is in heaven.
[1:13:44] Praise the name of our Lord. Let the
[1:13:46] light so shine.
[1:13:49] Let the word be made manifest in our
[1:13:51] lives.
[1:13:54] Let the truth come out of us.
[1:13:59] Praise the name of our Lord that surely
[1:14:01] the Lord lives in our lives.
[1:14:04] That's the desire of our God.
[1:14:07] that each and every one of us
[1:14:10] can walk in the light, can live in the
[1:14:14] truth.
[1:14:15] Praise the name of our Lord. May God
[1:14:18] bless you.
[1:14:19] Amen.
[1:14:24] Let us stand up and sing that song,
[1:14:26] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:14:29] 142.
[1:14:36] On Friday we have an overnight
[1:14:39] overnight. Then on Sunday we have two
[1:14:42] services.
