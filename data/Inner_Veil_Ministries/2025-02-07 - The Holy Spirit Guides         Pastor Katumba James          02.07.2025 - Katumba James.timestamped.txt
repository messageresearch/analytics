[32:40] Mhm.
[35:52] That's the spirit of the truth.
[35:58] And then he say that I have many things
[36:00] to say unto you.
[36:03] But you cannot bear them.
[36:07] You know, in other words, you cannot
[36:08] receive them at this time.
[36:12] But then as time goes on,
[36:17] you will be receiving them by step.
[36:25] You are going to be understanding them.
[36:29] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[36:32] goodness of the Lord
[36:34] gives us as we have need of
[36:39] the name of our Lord
[36:41] leading us and guiding us.
[36:45] So the Holy Spirit
[36:48] is actually the guide.
[36:51] Praise the name of our Lord, the
[36:53] message, a guide.
[36:56] He says
[36:58] now in this verse 13
[37:00] [Music]
[37:02] but when he the spirit of truth is come
[37:08] he will guide you into all truth.
[37:12] When the spirit of truth is come
[37:16] he will guide you into all truth.
[37:20] What is truth?
[37:22] The word. For he shall speak,
[37:26] he shall not speak of himself,
[37:30] but what he hears,
[37:33] he will speak.
[37:35] What he hears,
[37:37] he will speak.
[37:39] Other words, he will be the one that
[37:42] will reveal the thing.
[37:47] You see and the fourth chapter of
[37:50] Hebrews,
[37:54] the Bible say the word of God is sharper
[37:58] than is sharper
[38:02] more than
[38:04] more powerful than a two-edged sword.
[38:10] a discerner of the thoughts of the mind,
[38:15] the heart. See what he hears.
[38:21] He will speak
[38:23] and he will show you things to come.
[38:27] See what's going to do that.
[38:32] The Holy Spirit who will come in the
[38:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:39] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[38:42] here he says
[38:48] now a guide you know now a guide
[38:53] has to know the way.
[38:56] He has to know where he is going
[39:01] and what he is doing
[39:04] and how to take care of you as along the
[39:07] road.
[39:10] See, he's got to see that you don't come
[39:14] up lost
[39:17] a guide is a selected man.
[39:22] The state selects this man if he is a
[39:25] guide.
[39:30] And now in going on a trip into the
[39:32] wilderness
[39:35] where perhaps you are not used to going.
[39:40] It's not a good thing for you to go
[39:42] without one.
[39:45] Praise the name of our Lord. A guide
[39:48] guides us or directs us.
[39:52] He leads you actually
[39:55] because you know like God told the
[39:56] children of Israel
[39:59] that you don't know the way.
[40:02] So then he had to send an angel
[40:06] a pillar of fire which was going ahead
[40:10] of them
[40:12] to guide them in the path.
[40:15] Praise the name of our Lord. Now the the
[40:18] scripture says
[40:20] that when the pillar of fire stayed in a
[40:22] place
[40:25] the people also stayed in that place.
[40:28] But now when the pillar of fire started
[40:30] moving
[40:32] they also started moving.
[40:35] But what was in front following the
[40:37] pillar of fire
[40:41] where the priests carrying the ark of
[40:43] the covenant.
[40:46] Praise the name of our Lord. We do the
[40:48] same thing in our journey
[40:51] that we are in the third exodus.
[40:55] So we also need the guide of the Holy
[40:58] Spirit
[41:01] so that we can be able to possess the
[41:03] promise of our day.
[41:08] Praise the name of our Lord. We need a
[41:10] guy that can go ahead of us.
[41:14] And now God has sent the Holy Spirit
[41:18] as our guide.
[41:21] And then you see the Bible has says
[41:24] that when the spirit of truth is come,
[41:29] he will guide us into all truth,
[41:34] not some truth.
[41:37] But then all the truth
[41:39] and all the truth is the word of God.
[41:44] So now when we get the baptism of the
[41:46] Holy Spirit,
[41:49] the Holy Spirit will be concerned that
[41:51] we fulfill all the word of God.
[41:56] Praise the name of our Lord. That's the
[41:59] purpose of the Holy Spirit.
[42:02] that he can guide us,
[42:05] that he can lead us.
[42:08] So now if we are going to be guided by
[42:10] the Holy Spirit,
[42:14] we need to be submissive.
[42:19] Praise the name of our Lord, obedient to
[42:21] the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[42:25] In the message, the hand of the Lord
[42:27] came upon me.
[42:31] He says now kind he heavenly father
[42:36] the word of God must have first place in
[42:38] the service.
[42:42] I must have first place I must have
[42:46] first place in our life. It must have
[42:48] first place in our life
[42:52] and be first place in our thoughts
[42:58] for it is eternal.
[43:00] and shall never pass away.
[43:03] My words
[43:05] has to be altered like any other man's
[43:07] word.
[43:10] Times and has to be altered to meet
[43:12] time.
[43:18] Thy word never changes.
[43:22] There is no altering to God's word.
[43:27] It is forever the same.
[43:29] And we are grateful for this.
[43:32] And now, Holy Spirit,
[43:35] author of this word,
[43:38] will you come and open it for us
[43:40] tonight?
[43:43] And may the speaker be so submissive
[43:48] until you'll be able to come in
[43:53] and take the word of God
[43:56] and place it right out into every hungry
[43:59] heart.
[44:02] And may there it lodge
[44:07] find its abiding place.
[44:10] And may it bring forth fruit.
[44:14] 100fold
[44:17] salvation,
[44:20] healing,
[44:22] joy, peace. Grant it father.
[44:27] Praise the name of our lord. So here,
[44:29] brother was saying that we need to be
[44:32] submissive
[44:36] to the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[44:41] And Christianity
[44:44] is all about being submissive,
[44:48] being obedient to the word,
[44:51] being obedient to the leadership of the
[44:53] Holy Spirit.
[44:56] Like the Bible says, when the Lord Jesus
[44:59] Christ was filled with the spirit,
[45:03] the Holy Spirit himself
[45:06] led him into the wilderness
[45:11] in Luke 4:1.
[45:15] And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost
[45:18] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[45:20] Spirit into the wilderness.
[45:30] Now the Bible says that the Holy Spirit
[45:33] led Jesus into the wilderness.
[45:38] And then the scripture says
[45:41] days tempted of the devil.
[45:46] And in those days he did eat nothing.
[45:49] And when he were ended he afterward
[45:51] hungered. So
[46:01] praise the name of the Lord. He was
[46:03] depending upon the leadership of the
[46:05] Holy Spirit
[46:09] until he was saying I can do nothing
[46:13] except what I see my father do.
[46:18] So what when he would see a vision
[46:21] that's when he would do what the vision
[46:22] is instructing
[46:25] and so that's the same way the Holy
[46:27] Ghost comes down in our lives
[46:31] and he leads us
[46:34] you may not be able to see a vision
[46:37] but then you may end up doing some
[46:39] things by inspiration
[46:44] because the Bible says in the footsteps
[46:47] of the righteous
[46:49] are ordered of the Lord
[46:52] and how the Lord orders our footsteps.
[46:57] It is his sovereign grace.
[47:01] Sometimes he can speak to you.
[47:04] Maybe sometimes you can see an angel can
[47:07] instruct you
[47:10] like you see Cornelius.
[47:13] He was praying until the angel came down
[47:18] in Acts chapter 10. And now when the
[47:21] angel came down,
[47:23] he told him, sent for people to go and
[47:26] call for Simon Peter.
[47:31] So Ana, I mean Cornelius was obedient to
[47:34] the leadership of God.
[47:39] And then you see somewhere else
[47:43] Anas,
[47:45] he also saw a vision
[47:47] and God was telling him go to this
[47:50] place.
[47:52] You get a man called Saul is praying.
[47:56] And then again when you look at the
[47:58] vision of of Cornelius
[48:04] Cornelius actually it's the angel that
[48:06] physically came down.
[48:09] Now, Ananas,
[48:11] he knew what a vision was
[48:14] because he was a prophet and the word
[48:17] came to the prophet.
[48:19] And then when you go back to an
[48:21] Cornelius,
[48:24] Peter was hungry
[48:26] and then he saw a vision of, you know,
[48:28] things which which coming down from
[48:31] heaven,
[48:35] all sorts of animals.
[48:38] And then the voice told him,
[48:41] "Slay and eat."
[48:44] And then it came down three times.
[48:48] And then Peter was telling the voice,
[48:52] "Ah, I've never eaten something
[48:54] unclean."
[48:57] Let us go to that book of Acts chapter
[48:59] 10.
[49:01] And pick up that scripture.
[49:05] Acts chapter 10
[49:09] and then we go and pick verse 12.
[49:16] Okay. Verse 10.
[49:19] And he became very hungry and would have
[49:22] eaten. But while they made ready, he
[49:24] fell into a trance.
[49:40] And so heaven opened, and a certain
[49:42] vessel descending unto him, as it had
[49:45] been a great sheet knit at the four
[49:48] corners, and let down to the earth.
[50:12] Wherein were all manner of forooted
[50:14] beasts of the earth and wild beasts and
[50:17] creeping things and falls of the air.
[50:29] And there came a voice to him, "Rise,
[50:32] Peter, kill and eat.
[50:36] [Music]
[50:44] Lord, for I have never eaten anything
[50:47] that is common or unclean.
[50:58] Now you see that Peter
[51:01] was so much held up in the law of Moses
[51:08] until he recognized what he was being
[51:10] told to eat.
[51:13] And then he said, "I can't eat something
[51:15] unclean."
[51:18] That was his understanding.
[51:21] And then now the voice corrected him
[51:25] and said, "What God has cleansed that
[51:28] call not common.
[51:39] This was done thrice and the vessel was
[51:42] received up into heaven again.
[51:50] So now Peter was held in the law of
[51:54] Moses
[51:56] and he knew there I can't associate with
[51:59] uncleaness
[52:03] and now when he came out of the vision
[52:06] he started wondering what does the
[52:07] vision mean
[52:11] says he doubted within himself
[52:16] what the vision vision he had seen
[52:18] should meet.
[52:21] Now at that same time when he was
[52:24] thinking about the vision, why the Lord
[52:27] tell him to eat things which are not
[52:29] clean
[52:31] and the men that Cornelius had sent had
[52:34] already reached the place.
[52:39] And then the Bible says, "Behold, the
[52:41] men which were sent from Cornelius had
[52:44] made inquiry of Simon's house and stood
[52:47] before the gate." Verse 17.
[52:50] [Music]
[53:06] and called and that's whether Simon
[53:08] which was son named Peter was loded
[53:11] there.
[53:20] And then the Bible says
[53:22] Peter thought on the vision.
[53:28] The Holy Spirit said unto him,
[53:32] Behold, three men seek thee.
[53:37] Arise for
[53:40] and get thee down.
[53:45] go with them
[53:47] doubting nothing
[53:49] for I have sent them. Praise the name of
[53:52] our Lord. But then you look the other
[53:54] side.
[53:56] It was the angel that told Cornelius
[54:00] this side. The Holy Spirit telling
[54:03] Peter,
[54:04] I have sent these people.
[54:08] So now the Holy Spirit
[54:10] guided Peter into all truth.
[54:15] That's what the Lord is doing.
[54:19] To know that there is nothing anymore
[54:21] called unclean.
[54:27] The unclean thing now is sin.
[54:31] Not what you eat, not some people.
[54:36] It is the element of sin
[54:39] that makes somebody unclean.
[54:42] And then when somebody is unclean,
[54:46] there is the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:47] removed that uncleanness.
[54:51] So the Holy Spirit guided Peter into his
[54:56] word
[54:58] into the revealed word
[55:01] to know that there is no other no more
[55:04] people you call unclean because of their
[55:06] race or their origin.
[55:17] Praise the name of our Lord. So the Holy
[55:20] Spirit guided Peter
[55:23] and then told him please go with those
[55:25] people.
[55:27] And when Peter reached the house of
[55:29] Cornelius,
[55:31] he started asking Cornelius,
[55:34] why have you sent for me? Because those
[55:36] men told him.
[55:38] And then Peter just started talking
[55:41] about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:45] Praise the name of our Lord. It was the
[55:47] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[55:50] guiding Peter
[55:52] changing his thoughts about the people
[55:55] he would look at as unclean.
[56:01] The same thing the Holy Spirit
[56:04] when Ananas
[56:07] when God was telling him about St. Paul
[56:10] about Saul.
[56:14] Then Ananas was telling God that man is
[56:17] so terrible.
[56:21] But then what happened?
[56:24] The Holy Spirit told him
[56:27] that don't I've already chosen this man
[56:30] to be a vessel unto me.
[56:34] Praise the name of our Lord. So you see
[56:36] that the Holy Spirit
[56:39] guides us into all truth.
[56:42] He directs us.
[56:44] Praise the name of our Lord.
[56:47] Be yielding to the leadership of the
[56:49] Holy Spirit.
[56:52] And the Holy Spirit will always guide us
[56:55] into the word of God.
[56:59] The word that God has made known to us.
[57:03] Praise the name of our Lord.
[57:05] Brother, you are welcome with part of
[57:07] your family.
[57:11] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[57:14] message the word became flesh.
[57:17] He says God is expressed thought into
[57:21] the human heart
[57:29] moves right on
[57:32] as the immortal God leads his subjects
[57:35] from place to place.
[57:40] [Music]
[57:42] The Bible say the footsteps of the
[57:45] righteous man is ordered of the Lord.
[57:52] How new is the world?
[57:56] How long is eternity?
[58:00] When we think of the word of God
[58:04] expressed through the lips of a mortal
[58:06] being
[58:10] yet so submissive to the word of God.
[58:15] He said Isaiah spoke of it and they
[58:19] could not do it because Isaiah had said
[58:23] it under inspiration
[58:27] that Jesus Christ
[58:29] the Emmanuel
[58:31] here on earth with all the scriptures
[58:35] from everywhere
[58:39] walked on the earth.
[58:42] He knew that he was going to raise up
[58:44] the third day.
[58:49] Why? Because David under inspiration
[58:54] said, "I will not leave his soul in
[58:58] hell, neither will I suffer my holy one
[59:00] to see corruption."
[59:06] He said, "Therefore my heart rejoiced
[59:08] and my flesh was made
[59:15] was made glad."
[59:17] When Jesus
[59:19] under one word
[59:23] anction spoke by God through a man
[59:31] that he had his ups and downs
[59:36] David
[59:38] said I will not leave his soul in hell
[59:43] neither see my holy one see corruption.
[59:48] Praise the name of our Lord. So when the
[59:50] word of God is spoken
[59:55] is always it will always come to pass.
[1:00:01] Praise the name of our Lord. It will
[1:00:03] always come to pass
[1:00:05] because it has a destiny
[1:00:09] or it has a purpose it has to fulfill.
[1:00:14] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:00:16] Now in the message a guide still
[1:00:20] brother Brandham says God sends a guide
[1:00:26] and God wants you to remember
[1:00:30] that that is his appointed guide
[1:00:34] and we must remember him. Here it says
[1:00:39] Jesus said, "I will not leave you,
[1:00:44] but I'll pray the father that will send
[1:00:46] you another comforter."
[1:00:51] And this comforter
[1:00:53] when he was to come
[1:00:57] was to guide us into all truth.
[1:01:02] And the word of God is the truth.
[1:01:06] And the word is Christ.
[1:01:09] I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[1:01:13] He is the word. In the beginning was the
[1:01:16] word.
[1:01:18] And the word was with God,
[1:01:20] and the word was God,
[1:01:23] and the word was made flesh
[1:01:26] and dwelt amongst us. Then if we follow
[1:01:30] the real true guide,
[1:01:36] the Holy Spirit.
[1:01:38] He was to tell us what he had seen,
[1:01:43] what he had heard
[1:01:46] and what was to show us things that is
[1:01:49] to come.
[1:01:52] There you are. He's going to show you
[1:01:55] things to come.
[1:01:58] And when the churches today reject that,
[1:02:03] how can we ever expect to go to heaven
[1:02:08] when the Holy Spirit
[1:02:10] was sent to us a guide?
[1:02:16] We will take some cardinal or some
[1:02:18] bishop,
[1:02:21] some general overseer,
[1:02:25] somebody like that to guide us when the
[1:02:28] Holy Ghost was to give was to be our
[1:02:30] guide.
[1:02:35] The Holy Spirit
[1:02:37] always speaks the word.
[1:02:40] I've got many things to tell you,
[1:02:43] but you cannot understand it now.
[1:02:46] But when he comes, he will guide you to
[1:02:50] eat.
[1:02:52] That's the reason coming of the seals
[1:02:56] at the finishing of the seventh seal.
[1:03:01] The mystery of God should be finished.
[1:03:06] know who God is,
[1:03:09] what he is,
[1:03:11] how he lives,
[1:03:14] his nature,
[1:03:16] his being.
[1:03:18] You are supposed to be all the way up
[1:03:21] here by that time.
[1:03:25] You are supposed to be up here by that
[1:03:28] time
[1:03:31] to bring us into the full stature of
[1:03:33] sons and daughters of God.
[1:03:39] A church that is washed into the full
[1:03:41] stature of sons and daughters of God.
[1:03:48] A church that is washed in the blood of
[1:03:50] Jesus Christ
[1:03:53] that is bought without money
[1:03:57] and is paid for by the blood of Jesus
[1:03:59] Christ.
[1:04:01] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:04:03] yield to the Holy Spirit
[1:04:07] as our guide.
[1:04:09] Praise the name of our Lord. The Holy
[1:04:12] Spirit guides us
[1:04:14] and he guides us into all truth,
[1:04:19] not some truth
[1:04:21] because the word of God
[1:04:24] is spoken by the Holy Spirit.
[1:04:28] Praise the name of our Lord. what the
[1:04:30] Bible says when you read in revelation
[1:04:33] chapter 2
[1:04:36] here what the spirit says unto the
[1:04:38] churches.
[1:04:41] So it is the word of God is already
[1:04:44] spoken by the holy spirit to us
[1:04:48] and now when we are obedient to that
[1:04:50] word of god.
[1:04:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Then we are
[1:04:56] following the Holy Spirit.
[1:05:00] We are under the leadership of the Holy
[1:05:02] Spirit.
[1:05:04] We are under the guidance of the Holy
[1:05:06] Spirit.
[1:05:08] And it should always be our desire
[1:05:12] that Lord lead me,
[1:05:15] Lord guide me.
[1:05:17] Like in Psalms 31 verse1,
[1:05:23] He says,
[1:05:25] "In thee, oh Lord, do I put my trust.
[1:05:28] Let me never be ashamed. Deliver me in
[1:05:31] thy righteousness."
[1:05:35] Psalm 31:1
[1:05:50] Bow down thine ear to me. Deliver me
[1:05:53] speedily. Be th my strong rock for an
[1:05:56] house of defense to save me.
[1:06:22] For thou at my rock and my fortress,
[1:06:24] therefore, for thy name's sake, lead me
[1:06:28] and guide me.
[1:06:36] Praise the name of the Lord. So David is
[1:06:39] calling upon the Lord.
[1:06:42] Guide me,
[1:06:44] lead me,
[1:06:46] direct me, show me the path that I have
[1:06:50] to take.
[1:06:52] And you see this should be always our
[1:06:55] desire all the time
[1:06:58] that you rely on the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:03] Allow the Holy Spirit
[1:07:06] to guide you every day
[1:07:09] whereby you don't take your own
[1:07:11] decision.
[1:07:13] And how does the Holy Spirit guide us?
[1:07:17] The Holy Spirit guides us
[1:07:20] by us yielding to the word of God.
[1:07:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Because a
[1:07:26] guide speaks.
[1:07:29] A guide teaches
[1:07:32] and the Holy Ghost speaks to us.
[1:07:35] The way he we have seen he spoke to
[1:07:37] Peter.
[1:07:39] And then there's also another example
[1:07:40] here
[1:07:42] in Acts chapter 8
[1:07:46] and then verse 29.
[1:07:49] Praise the name of our Lord. Then the
[1:07:51] spirit said unto Philillip, "Go near and
[1:07:54] join thyself to this chariot."
[1:07:59] Acts 8:29.
[1:08:12] Praise the name of our Lord. The spirit
[1:08:15] telling Philillip
[1:08:19] because Philillip was preaching in a big
[1:08:21] city.
[1:08:25] And then the the angel of the Lord told
[1:08:28] Philillip
[1:08:30] in verse 29.
[1:08:32] And the angel of the Lord spoke unto
[1:08:34] Philillip.
[1:08:36] Verse
[1:08:38] 26.
[1:08:43] Arise, go toward the south unto the way
[1:08:46] that goes down to Jerusalem and to Gaza,
[1:08:48] which is the desert.
[1:09:01] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:09:04] So you see the spirit of God
[1:09:08] desires to lead us in everything that we
[1:09:11] do.
[1:09:16] Praise the name of our Lord. And God has
[1:09:19] sent the Holy Spirit
[1:09:22] to guide the church
[1:09:25] in the message the valley full of
[1:09:26] ditches.
[1:09:30] He says, "And God ne never did have at
[1:09:35] any time a group of men to run his
[1:09:37] church.
[1:09:48] his duty.
[1:09:50] That's what he's here for.
[1:09:53] That's what God sent him for.
[1:09:57] He will teach you.
[1:10:00] He will guide you into all truth
[1:10:03] and he will show you things to come
[1:10:06] and reveal these things.
[1:10:10] Take these sayings of mine and reveal
[1:10:13] them to you.
[1:10:18] Not the seminary,
[1:10:21] not as good as they are,
[1:10:24] not the church as good as it as it is,
[1:10:29] but the Holy Spirit
[1:10:32] that is the teacher
[1:10:35] and we've tried to adopt the man to take
[1:10:37] this Holy Spirit's place.
[1:10:42] We've tried to adopt certain different
[1:10:44] offices in the church to take the office
[1:10:46] of the apostles.
[1:10:53] apostles, prophets, and so forth in the
[1:10:55] church.
[1:10:58] But God set the gifts in the church.
[1:11:02] And we've took men and made them gifts
[1:11:11] instead of God's gifts.
[1:11:15] And that's what we are in today.
[1:11:19] You know, like in the denominations,
[1:11:22] you know, somebody goes and does a
[1:11:24] theological college degree
[1:11:28] and that makes him to qualify to be a
[1:11:31] gift of God.
[1:11:33] So it they just turn it around.
[1:11:37] Praise the name of our Lord. somebody
[1:11:39] who can speak so well
[1:11:43] an orator
[1:11:46] and then they say now this one can
[1:11:47] preach
[1:11:50] but then they didn't know that God chose
[1:11:51] Moses who was a stammer
[1:12:05] and then he used that one to write part
[1:12:07] of the Old Testament.
[1:12:11] stammer.
[1:12:13] Praise the name of our Lord. But because
[1:12:16] he was chosen of God
[1:12:19] and so Moses was being used by the Holy
[1:12:23] Spirit
[1:12:25] to speak the word of God, the way the
[1:12:27] Bible tells us that prophets in the Old
[1:12:31] Testament,
[1:12:33] they spoke as they were led by the Holy
[1:12:35] Spirit.
[1:12:38] because they even didn't understand
[1:12:40] but then they were under inspiration.
[1:12:47] So even us now
[1:12:50] we need the Holy Spirit
[1:12:52] because the Bible says in the Old
[1:12:55] Testament
[1:12:57] God spoke by the prophets
[1:13:00] but now he speaks in the son
[1:13:04] and now the son is the word.
[1:13:08] Praise the name of our Lord. We begin to
[1:13:10] see that we receive the word of God.
[1:13:15] The Lord can lead us
[1:13:18] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:13:20] message a guide
[1:13:23] he says now if God give a dark enough
[1:13:27] sense to know how to dodge the coldness.
[1:13:36] How ought he to have give the church
[1:13:42] that can do that by instinct.
[1:13:49] What about the Holy Spirit in the
[1:13:51] church?
[1:13:54] It ought to lead us from all formalities
[1:13:56] and crits and things
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:02] into a glorious wonderful baptism of the
[1:14:05] Holy Spirit.
[1:14:09] It brings virtue,
[1:14:12] knowledge,
[1:14:14] patience,
[1:14:15] godliness
[1:14:17] and holiness.
[1:14:19] That's what the real guide will lead
[1:14:26] because he will breathe out nothing but
[1:14:28] the gospel
[1:14:32] just the word of God.
[1:14:35] Sure, you need a guide.
[1:14:38] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[1:14:40] the Holy Spirit
[1:14:43] who has been given to us
[1:14:46] will always lead us
[1:14:49] into the things that pertain to the
[1:14:51] kingdom of God.
[1:14:54] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:14:56] why we really need to yield ourselves
[1:15:00] to the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:03] Brother Brham says that the Holy Spirit
[1:15:06] feeds on the word.
[1:15:09] So then you need to feed the word
[1:15:13] that the Holy Spirit
[1:15:15] can take that word you have read
[1:15:20] and then guide you how to fulfill that
[1:15:23] word.
[1:15:25] Praise the name of our Lord that the
[1:15:27] Holy Ghost can remind you the word.
[1:15:31] We need to see
[1:15:34] that we yield to the leadership of God.
[1:15:38] Praise the name of our Lord. In the
[1:15:40] message, the spirit of truth,
[1:15:43] he says, now in Hebrews chapter one,
[1:15:47] God in sun times
[1:15:51] and divine and diverse manners
[1:15:54] spoke to the father through the
[1:15:55] prophets.
[1:15:59] but in this last day by his son
[1:16:05] Christ Jesus. See it is the Holy Spirit
[1:16:10] taking over possession
[1:16:14] taking over possession of the church
[1:16:18] to operate Christ in the church.
[1:16:24] Then you become as he was.
[1:16:29] He became you.
[1:16:32] He became as you was.
[1:16:35] He became as he was.
[1:16:40] He become you that you might become him.
[1:16:46] That is it. It's above understanding.
[1:16:50] There is no way to explain it.
[1:16:53] And don't try it.
[1:16:56] Just accept it.
[1:16:58] He spoke it and that settles it. Praise
[1:17:03] the name of our Lord. So then the Holy
[1:17:05] Spirit when he takes over our lives,
[1:17:09] he makes us to be like Jesus Christ.
[1:17:13] Praise the name of our Lord, the way
[1:17:15] Jesus was led in the wilderness,
[1:17:18] the way Jesus was led in many different
[1:17:20] places.
[1:17:23] Even the spirit of God now
[1:17:27] leads us. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:17:30] We need to see that we yield to the
[1:17:33] leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[1:17:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Like
[1:17:39] Elijah,
[1:17:41] praise the name of our Lord. Elijah was
[1:17:43] led by the Holy Spirit.
[1:17:46] When you read in second kings chapter 2,
[1:17:51] Elijah was led from one place to another
[1:17:54] place
[1:17:56] and he had to follow the leadership of
[1:17:59] the Holy Spirit.
[1:18:02] You know there are some women in the
[1:18:04] Bible
[1:18:06] who would see either Elijah or Elisha
[1:18:08] who would see Elijah or Elisha.
[1:18:12] Every morning they would walk going
[1:18:14] maybe to a certain mountain.
[1:18:17] They go and then they come back. They go
[1:18:20] and then they come back. But I wonder
[1:18:22] they were wondering what were they going
[1:18:23] to do?
[1:18:25] They were being led by the spirit of
[1:18:27] God.
[1:18:29] Brother Brham, he would say, "I'm going
[1:18:32] to the wilderness,
[1:18:35] not necessarily to hunt,
[1:18:40] not the main issue of hunting, but to
[1:18:42] wait on the Lord,
[1:18:46] that he can know the will of God,
[1:18:49] cannot the purpose of God for different
[1:18:51] issues."
[1:18:54] And so then he would wait,
[1:18:56] sometimes takes days.
[1:19:00] Praise the name of our Lord. An answer
[1:19:03] from God.
[1:19:06] So they were always depending on the
[1:19:08] leadership of God.
[1:19:11] And that should also be the same thing
[1:19:13] with us.
[1:19:15] When we are making decisions in our
[1:19:16] lives,
[1:19:19] you have to see that you seek the Lord.
[1:19:23] Lord, I have this issue before me.
[1:19:26] May you guide me which decision to make
[1:19:28] in my life.
[1:19:36] Praise the name of our Lord. Like maybe
[1:19:38] you are looking a place where you want
[1:19:39] to stay.
[1:19:42] Pray to God to guide you to the right
[1:19:44] place.
[1:19:46] You want a place of work.
[1:19:49] Pray to God to guide you to the right
[1:19:51] place.
[1:19:53] Maybe you want marriage.
[1:19:56] Pray to get the right wife.
[1:20:00] Pray to get the right husband.
[1:20:04] All things that concern your life,
[1:20:08] learn to depend upon the leadership of
[1:20:10] God,
[1:20:14] praise the name of our Lord. Even the
[1:20:16] challenges that you face at home,
[1:20:19] the challenges that you face at work,
[1:20:23] you learn to commit them to the Lord
[1:20:27] and then you are not depending upon your
[1:20:29] understanding.
[1:20:32] The Bible says lean not on your
[1:20:35] understanding.
[1:20:38] But then you say Lord I have this
[1:20:40] dilemma.
[1:20:43] I don't know how to go about this issue.
[1:20:47] You wait on the Lord to see how the Holy
[1:20:51] Spirit
[1:20:53] will guide you on that particular issue.
[1:20:57] But then you know there are some people
[1:21:01] who want to put excuses there.
[1:21:06] Like now there are people in the days of
[1:21:08] Jeremiah
[1:21:11] they came to Jeremiah
[1:21:13] And then they told Jeremiah,
[1:21:16] "Oh, pray for us
[1:21:19] that we know the will of God."
[1:21:24] And now Jeremiah told them
[1:21:27] whatever the Lord will tell me
[1:21:31] that I'm going to tell you.
[1:21:33] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:21:36] Okay, it's good. I've got the scripture
[1:21:37] here.
[1:21:39] Jeremiah chapter 42.
[1:21:42] You know there was a captivity that was
[1:21:44] going on in Israel.
[1:21:48] So now these people
[1:21:51] they came to Jeremiah
[1:21:54] Jeremiah 42:1
[1:21:58] then all the captains of the forces and
[1:22:00] Johannan the son of Ker and Jezania the
[1:22:05] son of Hosia and all the people from the
[1:22:08] list even unto the greatest came near.
[1:22:11] for
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:40] and said unto Jeremiah the prophet,
[1:22:46] "Let we beseech thee, our supplication
[1:22:50] be acceptable before thee, and pray for
[1:22:53] us unto the Lord thy God, even for all
[1:22:56] discriminant, for we are left but a few
[1:22:59] of many as thine eyes do behold us.
[1:23:24] that
[1:23:33] that the Lord thy God may show us the
[1:23:35] way we are in. We may walk. And the
[1:23:38] thing that we may do
[1:23:52] Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto
[1:23:54] them, I have heard you. Behold, I will
[1:23:57] pray unto the Lord your God according to
[1:23:59] your words. And it shall come to pass
[1:24:02] that whatsoever thing the Lord shall
[1:24:04] answer you, I will declare it unto you,
[1:24:06] and I'll keep nothing back from you.
[1:24:23] Chari char.
[1:24:34] Then they said to Jeremiah, "The Lord be
[1:24:38] a true and faithful witness between us.
[1:24:40] If we do not
[1:24:43] even according to all the things for the
[1:24:45] Lord the Lord thy God shall send to
[1:24:47] thee, whether it be good or whether it
[1:24:49] be evil, we will obey the voice of the
[1:24:51] Lord our God, to whom we send thee, that
[1:24:54] it may be well with us when we obey the
[1:24:57] voice of the Lord our God.
[1:25:04] Fore! Foreign! Foreign!
[1:25:35] Lord. So Jeremiah went and prayed to the
[1:25:38] Lord.
[1:25:41] Then after 10 days,
[1:25:45] God told Jeremiah,
[1:25:48] "Tell these people
[1:25:50] not to leave the land.
[1:25:53] Let them not go anywhere else.
[1:25:57] I will protect them while they are here.
[1:26:00] Let them not go in Egypt."
[1:26:04] And then he said, "But if they decide to
[1:26:07] go in Egypt,
[1:26:09] they should know that they are going to
[1:26:11] be destroyed there."
[1:26:14] Now when Jeremiah came to tell these
[1:26:16] people the council of the Lord,
[1:26:20] they told Jeremiah,
[1:26:22] "What you are saying is false."
[1:26:27] In chapter 43:1,
[1:26:32] And it came to pass that when Jeremiah
[1:26:34] had made an end of speaking unto all the
[1:26:37] people, all the words of the Lord their
[1:26:39] God, for which the Lord their God had
[1:26:41] sent him to them, even all these words
[1:27:02] Then spoke Aaria the son of Hoser and
[1:27:06] Johannan the son of Ka and all the proud
[1:27:09] men, saying unto Jeremiah, Tho speaketh
[1:27:13] falsely, the Lord our God has not sent
[1:27:16] thee to say, Go not into Egypt to s John
[1:27:19] there.
[1:27:22] Fore! Foreign! Foreign!
[1:27:46] praise the name of our Lord. They came
[1:27:49] to ask with their intentions already
[1:27:52] declared in their hearts.
[1:27:56] until Jeremiah prophesied to them,
[1:28:01] God has said remain here.
[1:28:04] God has said don't go to Egypt.
[1:28:07] Then they said no no no no you are
[1:28:10] deceiving. We have to go to Egypt
[1:28:14] and they ended up going to Egypt.
[1:28:18] Now but look what Peter
[1:28:20] Peter when he saw the vision from heaven
[1:28:25] and then he started doubting
[1:28:28] and then the Holy Spirit told him
[1:28:32] don't doubt.
[1:28:34] We also need to yield to the guide of
[1:28:37] the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:40] Sometimes the leadership of the Holy
[1:28:42] Spirit
[1:28:45] may not take you into pleasant places
[1:28:47] according to your mind.
[1:28:53] It may not be pleasant to you.
[1:28:57] It may not be the most famous way.
[1:29:02] It may not be the most convenient thing
[1:29:04] at that time.
[1:29:07] But then the Holy Spirit knows why he's
[1:29:10] leading you into that kind of place.
[1:29:14] Praise the name of Lord. Because he
[1:29:17] knows the end from the beginning.
[1:29:21] He knows what is going to happen
[1:29:22] afterwards.
[1:29:26] So now when the Holy Spirit guides us,
[1:29:30] let us not be proud like these men.
[1:29:34] Ah, no. I don't think that's the the
[1:29:36] will of God.
[1:29:40] We need to yield to the leadership of
[1:29:41] the Holy Spirit.
[1:29:45] When the word of God tells you, do this.
[1:29:48] Humble yourself and do what the word of
[1:29:50] the Lord is telling you.
[1:29:53] Because he guides us into all truth.
[1:29:58] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:30:00] learn how to yield to the leadership of
[1:30:02] the Holy Spirit.
[1:30:05] And we need to be like Cornelius rather
[1:30:07] like Simeon.
[1:30:10] Let me just conclude with Simeon
[1:30:14] in Luke chapter 2
[1:30:17] and then verse 25
[1:30:22] Bible says and behold there was a man in
[1:30:26] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. The
[1:30:29] same man was just and devote waiting for
[1:30:32] the consolation of Israel and the Holy
[1:30:34] Ghost was upon him.
[1:30:53] And it was revealed unto him by the Holy
[1:30:55] Ghost that he should not see death
[1:30:58] before he had seen the Lord is Christ.
[1:31:11] And he came by the spirit into the
[1:31:14] temple. And when the parents brought in
[1:31:16] the child Jesus to do for him after the
[1:31:20] custom of the law, then he took him up
[1:31:22] in his hands and blessed the Lord.
[1:31:52] Praise God.
[1:31:54] The Holy Spirit was upon Simeon.
[1:31:58] We also need to have the Holy Spirit in
[1:31:59] our lives.
[1:32:01] And the Holy Spirit will always guide
[1:32:03] us.
[1:32:05] to the truth. He knows the time of
[1:32:08] fulfillment of everything.
[1:32:13] The same Holy Spirit took Simeon
[1:32:17] and took him where Jesus was as a baby.
[1:32:22] You know, there were so many babies that
[1:32:23] were brought in the temple,
[1:32:27] but it had to be the Holy Spirit to know
[1:32:29] who exactly is this Christ.
[1:32:35] That's how the Holy Ghost will also lead
[1:32:37] us
[1:32:40] even into the rapture.
[1:32:43] Praise the name of our Lord. We just
[1:32:45] need to be under continuous leadership
[1:32:47] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:32:50] He knows what exactly is going to happen
[1:32:54] at your place of work. Allow the Holy
[1:32:57] Ghost to be your guide.
[1:33:00] at your home. Allow the Holy Ghost to be
[1:33:02] your guide
[1:33:04] in your life. Allow the Holy Ghost to be
[1:33:07] your guide.
[1:33:09] You know the Bible says, "If you call
[1:33:11] upon the name of the Lord,
[1:33:14] he shall save you. Praise him."
[1:33:17] Like David said in Psalms 23,
[1:33:21] "The Lord is my shepherd.
[1:33:25] He leads me beside still waters.
[1:33:29] guides me to green pastures.
[1:33:32] He knows where is best for us.
[1:33:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[1:33:39] depend upon the leadership of the Holy
[1:33:41] Spirit.
[1:33:44] As the spirit of God guides us through
[1:33:46] the way,
[1:33:49] praise the name of our Lord. May God
[1:33:51] bless you.
[1:33:53] Amen.
[1:33:57] Let us stand up and sing that song where
[1:34:00] he leads me.
[1:34:06] On Sunday we having two services
[1:34:11] and then we shall have the Lord's supper
[1:34:14] after the second service.
[1:34:19] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:34:23] Okay. 68
[1:34:27] 158 Okay.
[1:34:29] 168.
[1:34:31] Amen.
[1:34:33] I can bless you. I can hear
[1:34:38] my Savior
[1:34:40] [Music]
[1:34:42] calling.
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:45] I can hear
[1:34:50] my savior
[1:34:54] holy.
[1:34:57] I can hear
[1:35:01] my savior
[1:35:05] calling.
[1:35:10] Day I cross
[1:35:13] and
[1:35:15] follow
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:21] me. Where he leads me now.
[1:35:25] Where he leads
[1:35:28] me,
[1:35:30] I
[1:35:32] will follow.
[1:35:38] Where he is,
[1:35:43] I
[1:35:46] will follow.
[1:35:52] Where he lives
[1:35:55] me,
[1:35:56] I
[1:35:59] will follow.
[1:36:03] [Music]
[1:36:05] I'll go with
[1:36:08] him,
[1:36:10] with
[1:36:11] him
[1:36:13] all
[1:36:15] the way. I'll go with him through the
[1:36:18] garden.
[1:36:20] Oh, I'll go with him
[1:36:26] through
[1:36:28] the garden.
[1:36:34] I go within
[1:36:39] through
[1:36:41] the garden.
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:47] I'll go with
[1:36:54] the garden.
[1:37:00] I'll go with
[1:37:03] him,
[1:37:05] with
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:08] all
[1:37:11] the way. I'll go with him through the
[1:37:14] judgment.
[1:37:16] I'll go with
[1:37:19] him
[1:37:21] through
[1:37:23] the judgement.
[1:37:29] I'll go with
[1:37:32] him
[1:37:34] through
[1:37:37] the judgement.
[1:37:42] humble
[1:37:44] with
[1:37:46] him.
[1:37:47] Through
[1:37:50] the judgement,
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:37:56] our God,
[1:38:01] waiting
[1:38:04] all
[1:38:06] the way. He will give me grace and

[1:39:42] I

[1:39:50] Our God within
[1:39:59] all
[1:40:01] thou.
[1:40:03] Each of us can pray. Father, how we
[1:40:05] thank you Lord Jesus Christ. How we
[1:40:08] glorify your holy name. How we magnify
[1:40:11] your holy name. Blessed be thy name Lord
[1:40:14] Jesus forever more Lord. How we desire
[1:40:16] you heavenly father to lead us Lord to
[1:40:20] guide us Lord for you alone knows the
[1:40:23] way father you alone knows the
[1:40:25] challenges that stand before us father
[1:40:28] we pray you may give us the grace in the
[1:40:31] name of Jesus Christ to always yield to
[1:40:34] the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:36] sometimes we may not know exactly what
[1:40:38] we are doing Lord how you told Peter
[1:40:41] when you are washing him and he was
[1:40:43] saying I don't want you to wash me and
[1:40:45] Then you told me what I do you may not
[1:40:48] know but you'll know later on. And many
[1:40:51] times heavenly father how the holy
[1:40:53] spirit leads us. Sometimes in things we
[1:40:56] may not understand. Sometimes in things
[1:40:59] we have never known but still the
[1:41:01] leadership of the holy spirit. How you
[1:41:03] led Peter heavenly father to go to
[1:41:06] Cornelius's house. Oh god. And you said
[1:41:08] this is the chosen person Lord. How you
[1:41:10] led Ana's heavenly father to go to where
[1:41:14] Saul was and yet he looked at him as a
[1:41:17] persecutor. Lord your ways Lord are past
[1:41:20] finding out. I pray may give us the
[1:41:22] grace heavenly father to yield to the
[1:41:25] leadership of the Holy Spirit. Have
[1:41:27] mercy upon us heavenly father and
[1:41:29] deliver us heavenly father from all
[1:41:32] rebarious spirits. Many times the devil
[1:41:35] would want us to reject the leadership
[1:41:37] of the holy spirit. Sometimes we want to
[1:41:39] move by what many people think is the
[1:41:42] right way. Oh Lord, I pray may help us.
[1:41:45] No wonder what the Bible says. Many
[1:41:47] people going into the white way and said
[1:41:50] many of them go there because they want
[1:41:53] to go by the popular way. They want to
[1:41:56] go by the easy way. They want to go by
[1:41:58] the path of least resistance. But Lord,
[1:42:01] your ways are past finding out. I pray
[1:42:04] may give us the grace in the name of
[1:42:06] Jesus Christ. Not to go where the masses
[1:42:08] go. Not to go where many people go. Not
[1:42:11] to go in that wide and destructive way.
[1:42:14] But in the name of Jesus Christ that we
[1:42:17] may make a decision, Lord, to follow
[1:42:20] that narrow path, Lord, to walk through
[1:42:23] that straight gate, heavenly father. Oh
[1:42:25] God, to make a right decision in our
[1:42:28] lives, Father. the leadership of the
[1:42:30] Holy Spirit. Lord, sometimes the places
[1:42:33] are not pleasing, Lord. But Lord, you
[1:42:35] know when you are taking us through all
[1:42:37] these places, Lord, even as you said, oh
[1:42:40] God, taking us through different
[1:42:41] situations, Lord, some through the
[1:42:43] floods, some through the water, some
[1:42:46] through the fire, but all of us will go
[1:42:48] through the blood. Give us the grace,
[1:42:50] heavenly father, to yield to your
[1:42:52] leadership, Lord, to depend upon you,
[1:42:55] Lord, and to call upon the name of the
[1:42:57] Lord. How we love you, heavenly father.
[1:43:00] How we call upon your name. Guide us,
[1:43:03] heavenly father. Direct us, heavenly
[1:43:05] father, and cause us to seek your face.
[1:43:08] Cause us to depend upon you. Cause us to
[1:43:10] call upon your name. Help us every other
[1:43:13] day, Lord, leading us, Lord, guiding us,
[1:43:16] Lord, even the things that do that all
[1:43:19] our lives father may be yielded unto
[1:43:22] you. We need you, heavenly father. We
[1:43:24] call upon your name. We ask you for your
[1:43:27] goodness, Lord. We ask you for the
[1:43:29] forgiveness, Lord, of all our sins and
[1:43:31] our trespasses, of all our failures,
[1:43:34] Lord. Be magnified. Be glorified, Lord.
[1:43:38] You are worthy, Lord. You are holy,
[1:43:40] Lord. You are wonderful, Lord. And you
[1:43:43] change out. Oh God, be magnified.
[1:43:45] Heavenly Father, oh God of our
[1:43:48] salvation, how we adore you, Lord Jesus
[1:43:50] Christ. Help us heavenly father to
[1:43:53] completely surrender Lord to thy
[1:43:56] leadership to completely surrender Lord
[1:43:58] to your power. The power of divine the
[1:44:01] Holy Spirit teaching us Lord guiding us
[1:44:04] Lord directing us Lord and showing the
[1:44:07] path we have to take. We need you
[1:44:09] heavenly father. Oh most precious father
[1:44:12] show us your way. Help us to walk in
[1:44:15] your way. Help us to walk in your truth.
[1:44:17] Help us fulfill your word. Help us,
[1:44:20] heavenly father, to depend upon you,

[1:44:39] father. Bless us all together. Oh God,
[1:44:42] wash us in the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:44:45] forgive us of all our failures, Lord.
[1:44:47] Fill us with your spirit Lord that more
[1:44:50] and more of God may come down in our
[1:44:53] lives. More and more of God may be
