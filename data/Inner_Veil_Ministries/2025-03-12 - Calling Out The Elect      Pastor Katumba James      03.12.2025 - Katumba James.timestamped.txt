[25:17] We're happy to be back again.
[25:20] Praise the name of our Lord.
[25:25] So on Sunday we shall be having two
[25:27] services.
[25:30] We are going to have the Lord's supper
[25:32] as well.
[25:35] So we come when we are prepared.
[25:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us turn
[25:41] to the book of Revelations.
[25:44] We're reading in chapter 18
[25:50] from verse one to verse 5.
[25:54] The Bible says,
[25:57] &gt;&gt; "And after these things, I saw another
[26:02] angel come down from heaven, having
[26:04] great power, and the earth was lightened
[26:08] with his glory."
[26:19] And he cried mightily with a strong
[26:22] voice, saying, "Beon the great is
[26:24] fallen, is fallen, and is become the
[26:27] habitation of devils, and the hold of
[26:29] every false spirit, and a cage of every
[26:33] unclean and hateful band.
[26:54] For all nations have drank of the wine
[26:57] of the wrath of her fornication, and the
[26:59] kings of the earth have committed
[27:02] fornication with her, and the merchants
[27:04] of the earth are works to reach
[27:08] through the abundancy of her delicacies.
[27:32] And I heard another voice from heaven,
[27:34] saying, "Come out of her, my people,
[27:37] that you be not partakers of her sins,
[27:40] and that you receive not of her plagues.
[27:58] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[28:00] and God has remembered her iniquities.
[28:09] May God blessing of his word.
[28:12] You may be seated.
[28:15] So I want to draw my subject from verse
[28:17] four
[28:21] which says come out of her my people.
[28:26] So I want to preach on calling out the
[28:28] elect.
[28:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Calling out
[28:36] the elect.
[28:39] Now we see that this mystery Babylon
[28:44] When you go back to the scriptures,
[28:49] it started from the book of Genesis
[28:53] when Nimrod
[28:55] and the people at that time
[28:58] they were building a tower
[29:02] and that place was called Babel
[29:07] and Babel
[29:09] means confusion.
[29:13] you know
[29:15] all those kind of thing.
[29:18] So now they their purpose of building
[29:21] the tower
[29:25] they wanted to reach heaven
[29:28] and they wanted to reach heaven
[29:31] without going through the right process.
[29:37] So they had nimrod for a king
[29:41] and the Bible says he was a mighty
[29:43] hunter.
[29:46] Now being a mighty hunter,
[29:49] he was actually hunting down righteous
[29:52] people,
[29:56] persecuting them, killing them, forcing
[30:00] the people to follow his religion.
[30:05] you know he desired to make a religion
[30:07] for himself
[30:10] and he made that religion and then he
[30:13] was able to lure the people.
[30:16] So now he established that as a great
[30:18] civilization in his day
[30:23] when you read in Genesis chapter 9 and
[30:25] chapter 10.
[30:30] Now there is just something that has
[30:31] come in my mind.
[30:34] You know when the people read in the
[30:36] scriptures in Genesis chapter one
[30:41] and then the Bible says and God said let
[30:43] us make man in our image
[30:48] and then they say you see there are
[30:50] three
[30:52] but they lack the understanding of the
[30:54] scriptures
[30:56] because if you read also in this time of
[30:59] Nimrod
[31:03] The Bible says in Genesis,
[31:07] &gt;&gt; let us get the book of Genesis.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 11
[31:14] and then verse 5.
[31:19] Okay, we can start from verse one.
[31:22] It says, "And the whole earth was of one
[31:24] language and of one speech.
[31:31] And it came to pass as they journeyed
[31:33] from the east, and they found a plane in
[31:35] the land of Shina, and they dwelt there.
[31:46] And they said one to another, "Go, let
[31:49] us make brick and burn them thoroughly."
[31:53] And they had brick for stone and slime
[31:55] they had for motor.
[32:18] And they said, "Go, let us build us a
[32:20] city and a tower whose top may reach
[32:22] unto the heaven, and let us make a name.
[32:25] Let us be lest we be scattered abroad
[32:28] upon the face of the whole earth.
[32:36] H2.
[32:49] So they wanted to go to heaven
[32:52] in kind of like a physical way,
[32:56] you know, because like if you want to go
[32:59] up,
[33:01] you put stairs to climb up.
[33:04] So now they also wanted to take time get
[33:07] to heaven.
[33:11] And the Bible says the Lord came down to
[33:13] the city and the tower which the
[33:16] children of men builded.
[33:25] And so the Lord said, "Behold, the
[33:27] people is one and they all one language.
[33:30] And this they begin to do. And now
[33:33] nothing will restrain them from which
[33:37] they have imagined to do.
[33:57] Now you see say they are determined they
[34:00] are going to do it.
[34:03] So you see that Babylon
[34:06] or
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Babel is the beginning of organized
[34:10] religion
[34:12] is the beginning of denomination.
[34:16] Some people reject the leadership of the
[34:18] Holy Spirit
[34:21] and then they have their own leadership.
[34:26] It doesn't matter what the word of God
[34:28] says.
[34:31] don't care what the word of God says.
[34:34] It's all about what they want to do.
[34:39] So now God said in verse seven,
[34:43] "Go to let us go down and confound their
[34:47] language that they may not understand
[34:50] one another's speech.
[35:03] Now who was God talking to that let us
[35:05] go down.
[35:09] It was not the trinity
[35:11] that father is here son is here. The
[35:14] holy ghost is here. So the father is
[35:17] telling the son
[35:19] the holy spirit let us go down. It
[35:23] wasn't so. So you can get the
[35:26] understanding of this scripture
[35:29] in Genesis 18
[35:32] when God came down
[35:35] with two angels.
[35:37] When you read Genesis chapter 18,
[35:40] when God says let us make man in our
[35:43] image,
[35:47] the Bible says God is a spirit.
[35:52] So the image of God the man he created
[35:55] in Genesis chapter one
[35:59] spirit man.
[36:01] In Hebrews chapter one
[36:04] the Bible says the angels are
[36:07] ministering spirits
[36:10] and he made a man as a spirit in Genesis
[36:13] one.
[36:15] So when
[36:17] we make money in our image
[36:20] talking about angels
[36:22] when he says let us go down he's talking
[36:26] about angels.
[36:28] So it's not that there are three gods
[36:32] three persons
[36:34] but it's only one god
[36:37] manifesting himself in different ways.
[36:41] Praise the name of our lord. Now we see
[36:44] organized religion
[36:46] started by Nimrod
[36:50] you know. So Babel
[36:52] &gt;&gt; when God because the Bible says
[36:56] &gt;&gt; verse 9
[36:58] therefore is the name of it called Babel
[37:02] because the Lord did there confound the
[37:05] language of all the earth.
[37:14] Now you find the also spoken about in
[37:16] the middle of the Bible
[37:21] &gt;&gt; because Babel
[37:23] &gt;&gt; became Babylon
[37:26] in the times of Nebuchadnezzar.
[37:29] If you read in the book of Isaiah and
[37:31] the book of Daniel
[37:34] and you know that Babylon,
[37:38] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord.
[37:40] was the head of God.
[37:43] And now this head of God
[37:46] was a very great gentile kingdom.
[37:55] He took over all the earth.
[37:58] Now you see that the image of Daniel
[38:01] had four kind of kingdoms.
[38:06] He had the head of gold.
[38:09] He had the the shoulders
[38:12] and the chest of silver
[38:16] which was actually the Persian and
[38:18] Persian and Median kingdom.
[38:23] Then it had the belly and the size of
[38:26] brass
[38:31] which was actually the Greek kingdom.
[38:36] Then it had the legs of iron and clay
[38:47] which was the Roman kingdom.
[38:52] And then the Bible says in Daniel 2,
[38:56] the stone was cut without hands
[39:00] the image
[39:02] at the feet.
[39:04] Now we need to know.
[39:07] Praise the name of our Lord. The times
[39:09] of the gentile
[39:12] started from the time of Babylon
[39:17] took over Jerusalem.
[39:20] And from the time Nebuchadnezzar has
[39:22] taken over Jerusalem,
[39:26] Jerusalem has always been dominated by
[39:29] the Gentiles.
[39:33] We know now of course Israel is in their
[39:36] homeland,
[39:38] but the international community,
[39:43] &gt;&gt; the international community
[39:51] they recognize Jerusalem
[39:54] not as the capital of Israel
[39:58] and they say Israel has no right over
[40:00] Jerusalem.
[40:03] They say Jerusalem is an international
[40:05] city.
[40:08] You can imagine Jerusalem
[40:12] &gt;&gt; where the temple mount is
[40:18] you know
[40:21] right now there is a mosque of Omar
[40:26] and now that area
[40:29] is not governed by the government of
[40:30] Israel
[40:33] but I believe it is Jordan which governs
[40:35] that place.
[40:38] And then Turkey comes in and other Arab
[40:41] countries come in to manage the affairs
[40:44] of that area.
[40:47] Even Jerusalem,
[40:50] the international community recognizes
[40:51] it as belonging to the Palestine.
[40:56] But we are living in the time
[41:00] that Jerusalem,
[41:02] praise the name of our Lord,
[41:05] great worship.
[41:07] will go back to the Jews.
[41:10] Praise the name of the Lord. So we see
[41:12] we are living in the time of the
[41:14] fulfillment of the prophecies.
[41:19] Now at the time we are living in
[41:22] we have another Babylon
[41:25] which the Bible calls mystery Babylon.
[41:30] And now this mystery Babylon
[41:33] the Bible says COMMITS FORNICATION WITH
[41:36] ALL THE NATIONS of the world
[41:41] rur all over the world.
[41:44] Now we see that the prophecy of Daniel
[41:47] chapter 2
[41:50] shows THAT THE FIRST COMING of Jesus
[41:52] Christ
[41:55] comes when it is the Roman Empire ruling
[41:57] the world.
[42:04] Then the second coming of Jesus Christ
[42:08] happened still when the Roman Empire is
[42:10] still ruling.
[42:14] Even the third coming of Jesus Christ,
[42:18] he comes to destroy that kingdom.
[42:22] So when Jesus was born,
[42:25] &gt;&gt; it was the emperor Rome.
[42:31] You know they were kings.
[42:35] But now this Roman Empire has changed
[42:38] over.
[42:41] It's now a religious kingdom.
[42:48] And now it is mystery Babylon.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So it is
[42:55] going down in every kingdom
[43:00] to see that they bring the union of
[43:02] religions together.
[43:11] Praise the name of our Lord. the time we
[43:13] are living in
[43:16] over just this weekend
[43:18] they were commemorating 1,700 years at
[43:28] the time they put that committee in 325
[43:32] edition
[43:36] you know the union where the religions
[43:38] came together
[43:46] Pay attention to what I'm saying now. So
[43:50] that time they had differences in
[43:54] doctrine and everything.
[43:57] So now when different people came
[43:58] together
[44:01] you know people who were pretenders to
[44:02] be Christians
[44:05] worshippers
[44:06] Christians and everybody when they came
[44:09] together then they instituted the
[44:11] trinity
[44:14] they started all the false teachings
[44:18] and so it was move that time.
[44:26] It was Constantine was putting that
[44:28] together
[44:30] was the emperor of Rome at that time
[44:33] and now the emperor of Rome.
[44:38] Now the emperor of Rome,
[44:41] praise the name of our Lord, the
[44:43] religious system
[44:46] is now bringing all the religions
[44:49] together.
[44:52] Praise the name of God. Now we are
[44:54] living in a time where deception is at
[44:58] its highest.
[45:01] Praise the name of God. BUT NOW THE
[45:03] BIBLE HAS told us
[45:06] in Revelations chapter 18
[45:09] that another angel came down from
[45:12] heaven.
[45:14] Praise the name of our Lord. BECAUSE THE
[45:16] WORLD WAS ALL DECEIVED.
[45:19] You know they were all thinking we are
[45:20] in the move of God.
[45:24] Romans chapter 4,
[45:27] one Lord, one baptism,
[45:30] one everything, one faith.
[45:33] And so they are collecting all the
[45:35] religions to come together
[45:38] and they think it is the move of God.
[45:42] But the Bible says in Revelations 18:1,
[45:49] "And after these things, I saw another
[45:52] angel come down from heaven
[45:57] having great powered
[46:01] with his glory."
[46:06] Now, in the message I'm against
[46:08] organized religion,
[46:12] in paragraph 205.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now here comes another
[46:19] messenger
[46:22] coming down
[46:25] the next chapter
[46:28] because he was he was first reading
[46:30] Revelation 17
[46:33] where the mystery was, you know,
[46:35] revealed
[46:37] of what the mystery of Babylon was.
[46:40] And then now he says in the next chapter
[46:44] which is now chapter 18
[46:47] now this is now the discovery of her
[46:50] mystery
[46:53] and her children's mystery.
[46:56] See, we understand now
[47:00] exactly what her her a lot
[47:05] because she committed adultery
[47:09] against God's word.
[47:12] And that's what made her an
[47:13] organization.
[47:16] She couldn't stay a a Bible church.
[47:27] and accept that
[47:30] and neither can any organization
[47:35] that don't take every word of it
[47:40] the way it is wrought
[47:43] ever be a Bible church
[47:48] and there is none of them that
[47:53] I know anything about
[47:56] not one. So there see as soon as she
[48:00] organizes the things she does
[48:10] both by scripture and the evidence
[48:18] is right there.
[48:21] She accepts the dogma.
[48:24] Now look
[48:26] what has happened.
[48:28] God God sent
[48:32] &gt;&gt; God sent
[48:38] in the this 18th chapter
[48:43] a mighty angel
[48:46] after that mystery was known
[48:50] a mighty angel
[48:52] or a messenger.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Watch here. After these things, I saw
[49:01] another angel come from heaven.
[49:07] This great power
[49:10] and the earth was lightened by his
[49:12] glory.
[49:15] After then he says and he cried with a
[49:18] loud voiceon
[49:23] confusion
[49:25] the great is falling
[49:29] &gt;&gt; and is become the habitation of devils
[49:35] every hold of every false spirit
[49:40] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[49:49] And all nations have drunk of the wine
[49:51] of her wrath of her fornication.
[49:56] And the kings of the earth
[49:59] have committed fornications
[50:02] with her and the merchants of the earth
[50:07] as works rich through the abundance of
[50:09] her desolate.
[50:14] In paragraph 207,
[50:17] Luke,
[50:20] immediately after her mystery was made
[50:22] known,
[50:25] who she was,
[50:27] what she was, who her daughters was.
[50:32] The mystery has been made known.
[50:36] Then God sent an angel,
[50:40] a messenger
[50:42] to what
[50:45] &gt;&gt; to call out,
[50:48] &gt;&gt; come out the message of the hour.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So we have
[50:55] the MESSAGE THAT IS CALLING OUT THE
[50:57] ELECT.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; It's calling the elect out of, you know,
[51:04] organized religion. HE'S
[51:08] CALLING THE ERECT OUT OF BABYLON.
[51:12] And then the message is saying, "DON'T
[51:15] PARTAKE OF HER SINS."
[51:18] Brother Brennham TELLS US WE SHOULD
[51:21] organize religion
[51:27] like a plague.
[51:29] The way you were careful about corona
[51:34] until even you would spray wherever
[51:35] you're going to touch.
[51:38] You spray even on the doors,
[51:41] the handles.
[51:43] Be careful about organized religion
[51:47] because organized religion
[51:50] means death before God.
[51:53] Spiritually dead
[51:56] because they have rejected the Holy
[51:58] Spirit.
[52:00] So now we have the message of the hour
[52:03] that calls us out.
[52:08] Praise the name of our Lord. IT CALLS
[52:10] OUT OF ALL the denominations
[52:14] because that's Babylon.
[52:16] It is confusion.
[52:19] YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S happening nowadays.
[52:22] Everything they are doing is not word
[52:26] based.
[52:28] They only bring the word once and then
[52:31] they follow what they want to do.
[52:34] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[52:36] the problem that we have,
[52:39] people are going back to their religions
[52:43] and they pick one thing or two things
[52:45] and come
[52:48] picking again another hybrid.
[52:51] But the message of the hour that we have
[52:54] got,
[52:56] praise the name of our Lord, the message
[52:59] that we have
[53:02] calls us out
[53:05] from all those traditions of those
[53:07] religions
[53:10] in the message the feast of the trumpet
[53:16] in Revelations 12 11
[53:20] their ministry
[53:23] will be the ministry of Moses and Elias
[53:29] calling to Israel
[53:32] calling them out of the Jewish
[53:35] traditions
[53:38] now Israel right now they are blind
[53:43] they don't know what really happened
[53:46] God blinded them
[53:49] but now they are thinking
[53:51] that the atonement
[53:55] is still on the blood of animals.
[53:59] No wonder they got the red hers
[54:03] and then it was a big public. They
[54:05] taking them to Israel.
[54:07] They are protecting them.
[54:10] That's still a Jewish tradition.
[54:13] But now after the rapture,
[54:16] God is going to send Elijah and Moses
[54:20] who will go and call out the 144,000
[54:24] Jews
[54:32] and call them out of the Jewish
[54:34] traditions
[54:37] and show them the true atonement
[54:41] and the true atonement
[54:45] is our Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the
[54:48] name of the Lord because they are still
[54:50] blind
[54:52] but they are waiting for the Messiah.
[54:55] So now here in the message the feast of
[54:57] the trumpet
[54:59] brother Brandham says Moses and Elijah
[55:03] are to come and call the Jews
[55:07] of Israel.
[55:09] Praise the name OF OUR LORD
[55:11] OUT of the Jewish tradition.
[55:15] Praise the name of our Lord. Let me read
[55:17] it to you. It says, "Just as the seventh
[55:20] angel,
[55:23] Just as the seventh angel's message
[55:28] called the bride
[55:32] out of the Pentecostal tradition.
[55:38] And now we are in the message, but we
[55:40] want to go back the Pentecostal
[55:42] tradition.
[55:44] You know in Pentecost to receive the
[55:46] Holy Spirit
[55:49] you must speak in tones
[55:52] and then here we are.
[55:55] You must feel emotions.
[55:58] Pentecostal tradition
[56:01] and then we feel going by that
[56:06] brother until you feel something
[56:12] that's not the evidence of the Holy
[56:14] Spirit.
[56:16] But this is where we are getting
[56:18] ourselves.
[56:20] If I don't feel well, if I don't feel
[56:23] excited,
[56:27] I've not gotten the Holy Spirit. And the
[56:28] Bible says doesn't come with
[56:30] observation.
[56:33] Praise the name of course, somebody can
[56:36] talk about the day of Pentecost.
[56:39] But on the day of Pentecost and you read
[56:42] the book of Acts,
[56:44] other areas when the Holy Ghost filled
[56:46] the people,
[56:51] It's only on the day of Pentecost
[56:56] where you find the tongue of fire on
[56:58] their head.
[57:00] So their eyes would see that tongue of
[57:02] fire.
[57:04] Their bodies would feel that wind in the
[57:06] room
[57:08] pimples coming.
[57:12] Then the tanks were quickened.
[57:19] You know, you know, the the tongues
[57:21] spoke,
[57:22] the eyes saw, the body felt, the ears he
[57:26] had that sound.
[57:30] But that same day on Pentecost,
[57:33] 3,000 were added.
[57:36] Did the wind again come, the blowing,
[57:38] the tanks were were on their way.
[57:44] It's not the same, but it's the same
[57:46] Holy Spirit.
[57:49] You go to Acts chapter 8,
[57:52] you go to Acts chapter 9, you go to Acts
[57:55] chapter 10, you go to Acts chapter 19.
[57:59] The Holy Ghost was filling them.
[58:02] But what happened was totally different.
[58:06] Praise the name of our Lord. So now the
[58:08] Pentecostals speak that you have to
[58:10] speak in tongues.
[58:16] And then we also go and pick there.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; You have to feel.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; How did you feel?
[58:24] &gt;&gt; That's not so praise the name of our
[58:26] Lord. So the message of the hour
[58:30] takes us from those Pentecostal
[58:32] traditions.
[58:35] until you get somebody
[58:41] looked for the Holy Ghost since 10
[58:43] years.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; You've looked
[58:47] and you've never got there's something
[58:49] wrong. You don't know what you're
[58:51] looking for.
[58:53] Praise the name of our Lord.
[58:56] The quote pastor read on Sunday,
[58:59] God is not an Indian giver.
[59:03] He says
[59:07] but let me this way that's not God.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. That's not
[59:13] how he does things.
[59:15] But then our mind has come like that
[59:19] because we have a contrary understanding
[59:23] to what the Holy Spirit is.
[59:27] There is a sister.
[59:30] Praise the name of our Lord. So she went
[59:32] with that same understanding
[59:39] and so she was in one church.
[59:42] The emotions happened the way they
[59:44] described that that's the Holy Spirit
[59:48] and then she went home. When the time
[59:51] for the next service came,
[59:55] she told the person she was staying
[59:57] with,
[1:00:01] I don't need to go to
[1:00:04] the Holy Ghost. Contrary,
[1:00:09] if you have the Holy Spirit, will draw
[1:00:12] you always into the presence of God and
[1:00:14] where they serve.
[1:00:17] It's the life of Christ.
[1:00:19] It's a continuous fountain.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. If you have
[1:00:24] the Holy Spirit, you'll have the life of
[1:00:27] Jesus Christ.
[1:00:30] But you get somebody says for you don't
[1:00:32] have the Holy Spirit. And he says for
[1:00:35] him, he has the Holy Ghost
[1:00:37] but to hate people.
[1:00:43] Then you start wondering where the Holy
[1:00:45] Spirit is in that person.
[1:00:48] Where is the life of Jesus Christ?
[1:00:53] So the message of the hour
[1:00:56] comes and takes us from that tradition
[1:01:02] Pentecostal traditional
[1:01:04] and then he says remember okay he says
[1:01:08] the seventh angel's message
[1:01:13] called the bride
[1:01:16] out of the Pentecostal tradition
[1:01:21] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[1:01:23] says, remember Moses and Elijah
[1:01:26] used to call Israel
[1:01:30] out of the old atonement
[1:01:34] of the lamb and the sheep
[1:01:38] and the blood and goats
[1:01:42] and sacrifice
[1:01:44] to the real living sacrifice.
[1:01:49] to the word.
[1:01:51] Praise the name of our Lord. Now we know
[1:01:53] that the true atonement
[1:01:56] is the blood of Jesus Christ. Now the
[1:01:59] blood of Jesus Christ is the word of
[1:02:03] God.
[1:02:04] Praise the name of our Lord. So the true
[1:02:06] atonement now
[1:02:09] is the message of the hour.
[1:02:12] That's where forgiveness of sins
[1:02:16] because sin is unbelief.
[1:02:20] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[1:02:21] message calls the elect
[1:02:26] out of confusion of baby Lord,
[1:02:29] out of confusion of Pentecost,
[1:02:33] out of confusion of Baptists.
[1:02:37] all this confusion.
[1:02:42] Praise the name of Lord. The message is
[1:02:44] calling us out of Babylon.
[1:02:47] And the seventh angel's message
[1:02:51] under the same seal
[1:02:56] is to call the people
[1:03:00] the bride
[1:03:01] out of the Pentecostal and world
[1:03:04] tradition.
[1:03:08] to the genuine atonement.
[1:03:13] The word
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Christ
[1:03:16] impersonated in his word here
[1:03:21] made flesh among us.
[1:03:25] Praise the name of Lord. That's the
[1:03:27] message of the hour.
[1:03:30] So outside of the message of the hour,
[1:03:34] there's no atonement.
[1:03:36] True atonement
[1:03:38] is in the message of the hour.
[1:03:41] How do you escape Babylon?
[1:03:44] Come to the message. Praise the name of
[1:03:47] our Lord. Take the message.
[1:03:50] How the Lord has given to us.
[1:03:54] That's where our atonement is. Praise
[1:03:57] the name of our Lord. So that calls out
[1:04:00] the bride
[1:04:03] from the confusion.
[1:04:05] Praise the name of the confusion of
[1:04:08] religion,
[1:04:10] the deception of religion.
[1:04:13] And we see the time we are living in
[1:04:16] the plant,
[1:04:18] the whole maze
[1:04:20] is dry.
[1:04:22] Why? Because the life has gone into the
[1:04:26] seed.
[1:04:29] And the seed now
[1:04:31] is the life of Christ which is in the
[1:04:34] elect.
[1:04:36] The bride of Jesus Christ. So each and
[1:04:39] every one of us you need to desire
[1:04:43] that life of Jesus Christ to live right
[1:04:46] inside of you.
[1:04:48] Praise the name of our Lord because it
[1:04:50] is a calling out.
[1:04:53] And when he calls us, he calls us out,
[1:04:58] he calls us to the union with Christ.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; So now we unite with Christ,
[1:05:06] which is his word.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord and that
[1:05:10] makes us to be ready for the rapture.
[1:05:15] Now in the message the feast of the
[1:05:16] trumpet
[1:05:19] he says paragraph 207
[1:05:23] also that church
[1:05:26] has bound the Holy Ghost
[1:05:30] for nearly 2,000 years
[1:05:35] under madom
[1:05:38] back there
[1:05:40] and under the church ages. is
[1:05:44] praise the name of the Lord. So he says
[1:05:47] the churches
[1:05:49] have bound the Holy Spirit
[1:05:53] 2,000 years.
[1:05:55] How did they bind the Holy Spirit?
[1:05:58] They bound the Holy Spirit
[1:06:01] by their creeds and doggy.
[1:06:05] Praise the name of our Lord that the
[1:06:08] Holy Spirit
[1:06:10] cannot work in the church
[1:06:13] because of manmade systems.
[1:06:18] Praise the name of our Lord. But she's
[1:06:20] going to be liberated.
[1:06:22] She's coming back. That's what the Bible
[1:06:26] said. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:06:28] when people go to traditions,
[1:06:32] they went in the time of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:33] Christ, they had their traditions,
[1:06:37] wash your hands this way.
[1:06:40] Don't eat with unwashed hands.
[1:06:45] Do this. And he says in vain do they
[1:06:47] worship.
[1:06:50] And people take those things to be so
[1:06:52] serious.
[1:06:56] You know they they are so dear to them.
[1:07:00] But when you present the word of God
[1:07:04] they reject the word of God.
[1:07:06] So he says they wash me by their mouth
[1:07:11] but their heart is far from me.
[1:07:14] So that's how it has been in the ages
[1:07:18] that people took their crits and doggy.
[1:07:22] people took their kind of own traditions
[1:07:27] and that was their form of worship.
[1:07:31] That's why in every age
[1:07:34] God was sending a messenger
[1:07:38] and that messenger was to bring the
[1:07:41] people back to the truth.
[1:07:44] Praise the name of Lord. So the message
[1:07:47] that God sent
[1:07:51] was the deliverance for the people of
[1:07:53] that time.
[1:07:55] Praise the name of the Lord. Because
[1:07:57] people had left the word
[1:07:59] and the plea of God.
[1:08:03] Come back to the word. Come back to the
[1:08:06] word. Come back to the word. And there
[1:08:09] can never be a true revival
[1:08:13] if the people don't get back to the
[1:08:15] right word.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So when you
[1:08:20] read in Revelations chapter 2,
[1:08:23] you see every age had a messenger
[1:08:27] and a message for every age
[1:08:35] was being given to the messenger.
[1:08:39] unto the angel of Ephesus righteously.
[1:08:43] Revelations 2:1.
[1:08:46] Then in Revelations 2:7
[1:08:50] at the end of the message of the age,
[1:08:54] he says, "Let him that as an ear
[1:08:58] what the spirit says to the church."
[1:09:01] But how was the voice coming?
[1:09:04] The voice was coming through the
[1:09:06] messenger of the day.
[1:09:09] So even now in this ludician age,
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; we have heard the voice
[1:09:16] of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:19] using brother William Marion Brham,
[1:09:22] the message of the hour.
[1:09:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Now the
[1:09:27] ministry of brother Brham
[1:09:30] was proved beyond doubt.
[1:09:35] Praise the name of our Lord. God proved
[1:09:37] it as the message of the hour.
[1:09:42] Now what the devil does is to make you
[1:09:46] doubt what we have been given
[1:09:50] to make you not take it serious
[1:09:54] to make you take it lightly.
[1:09:59] You know, you don't care. See what the
[1:10:01] devil is doing. Praise the name over
[1:10:05] like what we were sharing in the morning
[1:10:06] exaltation.
[1:10:10] So the devil make sure that you have no
[1:10:13] time for the message.
[1:10:15] You are too busy to read the message.
[1:10:18] You are too busy to hear the message.
[1:10:21] So you get yourself in deception.
[1:10:26] That's what the devil does. He makes
[1:10:29] sure you don't hear.
[1:10:32] He makes sure you know you have many
[1:10:34] troubles.
[1:10:37] So you are afraid to identify yourself
[1:10:38] as a message believer
[1:10:42] even at your place of work. You don't
[1:10:45] want where you fellowship from.
[1:10:49] You don't want tell people that God has
[1:10:50] sent us a message.
[1:10:55] You are just too busy over other things,
[1:10:59] too busy at work, too busy on the phone,
[1:11:04] you can afford to spend all the time on
[1:11:06] other media.
[1:11:09] But now when it comes to the table
[1:11:13] where the message of the our application
[1:11:15] is
[1:11:19] maybe when you have doubt that's when
[1:11:20] you try to go there.
[1:11:24] Once in a while
[1:11:26] maybe you like sometimes these phones
[1:11:28] can tell you
[1:11:31] your your space is getting over
[1:11:35] and then they tell you unused
[1:11:36] applications.
[1:11:40] You last used the table two months ago.
[1:11:48] So you start ah but why not delete all
[1:11:54] And I said, "Sure, let them be deleted."
[1:11:56] But you are creating space for Tik Tok
[1:11:58] videos,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; creating space for WhatsApp,
[1:12:05] space for Facebook, Facebook. And that's
[1:12:09] what the devil is doing to us that we
[1:12:12] don't have enough time.
[1:12:15] We don't have enough time.
[1:12:19] You have this program
[1:12:22] and the other program and the things of
[1:12:25] God
[1:12:26] they are taken lightly.
[1:12:29] That's what the devil is doing. So then
[1:12:31] how will you know what the Lord has
[1:12:33] prepared for us?
[1:12:36] When the Bible says, "Praise the name of
[1:12:39] our Lord." In the book of John chapter
[1:12:42] 10
[1:12:44] and then verse 27,
[1:12:46] it says, "My sheep hear my voice."
[1:12:52] John 10:7.
[1:13:00] and I know them and they follow me.
[1:13:06] Now if his sheep hear his voice,
[1:13:12] which voice do you hear?
[1:13:14] And there are so many voices,
[1:13:18] but the voice of God is a still small
[1:13:22] voice,
[1:13:25] very humble.
[1:13:27] Praise the name of our Lord. How you
[1:13:30] need to get yourself acquainted with the
[1:13:32] voice of God.
[1:13:36] Keep hearing that voice on a daily
[1:13:37] basis.
[1:13:39] Find time.
[1:13:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Let the
[1:13:43] message and hear what the prophet says.
[1:13:47] Find times.
[1:13:51] Praise the name of Lord that you are not
[1:13:53] taken unawares.
[1:13:58] you know, so that you're not surprised
[1:14:00] about what's happening.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of God. Let us go back
[1:14:07] to the message, the feast of the
[1:14:08] trumpet.
[1:14:20] He says
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit has been bound by these
[1:14:26] denominational rivers
[1:14:32] for almost 2,000 years.
[1:14:36] Verse is, but it is to be loed in the
[1:14:39] evening time
[1:14:44] by the evening time message.
[1:14:51] The Holy Spirit back in the church
[1:14:54] again,
[1:14:56] Christ himself
[1:14:59] revealed in human flesh
[1:15:04] in the evening time.
[1:15:07] Praise the name of our Lord. So the Holy
[1:15:10] Spirit calls the elect out of
[1:15:12] denomination
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; so that we can have fellowship with the
[1:15:17] Holy Spirit. We can have communion with
[1:15:20] the Holy Spirit. And when we come out,
[1:15:25] he gives us the mana from heaven,
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; true manner from heaven,
[1:15:32] which is the message of the hour. Praise
[1:15:35] the name of the Lord. So as elect who
[1:15:39] have been called out, we have a
[1:15:42] responsibility.
[1:15:44] Praise the name of our Lord to take the
[1:15:46] whole council of God.
[1:15:50] The message that the Lord has given unto
[1:15:51] us. See that you don't take it lightly.
[1:15:56] See that let it be so dear to you.
[1:16:01] Praise the name of our Lord because it
[1:16:02] is the message
[1:16:05] that prepares us for the second coming
[1:16:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:16:10] When brother Brham was baptizing in 1933
[1:16:16] in June
[1:16:19] in Ohio River,
[1:16:22] praise the name of our Lord. A bright
[1:16:24] shining light came down from heaven
[1:16:30] and then came, praise the name of the
[1:16:33] Lord, when he was baptizing on the river
[1:16:36] and a voice said
[1:16:39] as John the Baptist
[1:16:41] was sent for the first coming of Jesus
[1:16:44] Christ.
[1:16:47] You are sent with the message
[1:16:50] to forun
[1:16:52] the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:55] We have a message
[1:16:57] that prepares us for the rapture.
[1:17:00] Praise the name of our Lord. We have a
[1:17:02] message that reveals Christ to us.
[1:17:08] So it is very important for everyone of
[1:17:10] us
[1:17:12] to take the message
[1:17:15] to be personal.
[1:17:18] personal to you. Read what the Lord has
[1:17:21] said of these things.
[1:17:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Not the
[1:17:26] times and the seasons we are living in.
[1:17:29] Don't just do here say
[1:17:34] praise the name of our Lord. Know
[1:17:35] yourself and read the things.
[1:17:38] We have a lot of books around. Why don't
[1:17:41] you take time and read your book
[1:17:44] meditatively?
[1:17:47] You know, read these things.
[1:17:50] Take a book. You can have a target.
[1:17:52] Maybe every week I'm going to read a
[1:17:54] book.
[1:17:57] You pick this message. You start reading
[1:17:59] it from the very beginning.
[1:18:05] Don't be in a rush.
[1:18:07] Take your time. Read it.
[1:18:11] Because we have a privilege here that
[1:18:13] each of us can have their own copies.
[1:18:17] Take time and read the things
[1:18:20] all the time on Facebook
[1:18:24] until the whole night three four hours
[1:18:26] on Facebook.
[1:18:30] But what these messages
[1:18:33] you can find that within 3 or 4 hours
[1:18:39] you know you have finished a a book a
[1:18:40] message book you've already finished it
[1:18:45] why don't you take time have a purpose
[1:18:48] in your life have a target in your life
[1:18:53] don't just wait when you come to church
[1:18:56] oh what have they given us today
[1:18:59] and then you go with that quote and some
[1:19:02] people they busy looking for quotes from
[1:19:05] other pastors or ministers.
[1:19:12] No, why don't you go to the original
[1:19:15] things?
[1:19:18] But you just want to hear from
[1:19:20] somebody's interpretation,
[1:19:22] explanation
[1:19:24] and then that excites you and all the
[1:19:26] time you are checking.
[1:19:28] All the time you are checking and then
[1:19:31] there are some people who know how to to
[1:19:33] roam around services in different
[1:19:34] churches.
[1:19:37] They have enough data to go and listen
[1:19:39] to a service somewhere there.
[1:19:42] following another service somewhere
[1:19:44] there.
[1:19:46] Why don't you take that time to read the
[1:19:47] message?
[1:19:51] Praise the name of that time you are
[1:19:54] putting on.
[1:20:00] Why don't you take time and listen to a
[1:20:02] message
[1:20:04] and hear from the original
[1:20:07] otherwise you may end up getting spirit
[1:20:09] somewhere.
[1:20:13] Then you get confused
[1:20:15] then but they don't teach it like that
[1:20:20] and you find your heart withdrawing.
[1:20:23] Go and feed from the original.
[1:20:28] Praise the name of Lord. Take your time
[1:20:30] and read this message book.
[1:20:33] Not just speaking one paragraph
[1:20:36] and the whole week you have only one
[1:20:37] paragraph.
[1:20:44] No, go and read the whole message book.
[1:20:47] See the background.
[1:20:49] How is brother not approaching this
[1:20:52] subject?
[1:20:54] What explanation is he giving how is he
[1:20:56] concluding it then you know today I've
[1:20:59] read this message
[1:21:01] maybe next week I'll read another
[1:21:03] message week I'll read another message
[1:21:05] and you find a lot of things there.
[1:21:09] That will influence your life
[1:21:12] and your thinking is going to change.
[1:21:15] Your speech is going to change. Decision
[1:21:18] making is going to change. You find
[1:21:20] there are even testimonies.
[1:21:23] Maybe he's giving a testimony of
[1:21:25] something
[1:21:27] about this thing.
[1:21:31] Praise the name of Lord. You know the
[1:21:33] way the Bible is written
[1:21:36] is how the message has also been
[1:21:38] preached.
[1:21:40] When you read in the scriptures
[1:21:42] like I'll give an example.
[1:21:45] There is a man who was a who was a he
[1:21:49] was a man who was heading a synagogue
[1:21:54] and then he came to Jesus
[1:21:57] and they told Jesus this man is
[1:21:59] honorable
[1:22:02] and then now the man said my patient my
[1:22:04] my child is sick
[1:22:08] and then they started walking with Jesus
[1:22:11] but you know along the way
[1:22:14] that story ends
[1:22:17] And then a woman of blood issue comes in
[1:22:22] and then he touches him and then the
[1:22:24] attention of Jesus is a woman with a
[1:22:26] blood issue.
[1:22:29] Now if you take a quote
[1:22:32] you may end up that Jesus was moving
[1:22:35] going there but you know what happened
[1:22:36] there
[1:22:40] because you're only taking a quote.
[1:22:42] You're not going further to look at the
[1:22:44] conclusion of the issue
[1:22:48] or you only read a part
[1:22:51] like some of these friends of ours on
[1:22:53] their
[1:22:55] religious crusades.
[1:22:59] They get a scripture and pick only half
[1:23:02] of the scripture
[1:23:05] and now they start confusing you. If you
[1:23:08] don't read the scriptures before
[1:23:11] and the scriptures after, you'll be
[1:23:14] confused like them.
[1:23:16] And even some that's how they read the
[1:23:18] message.
[1:23:22] This is a very what was he up to?
[1:23:27] Praise the name over. You read the book
[1:23:29] in Genesis,
[1:23:32] you find the Bible is talking about
[1:23:34] Jacob.
[1:23:36] Then when it goes to Jacob, then it goes
[1:23:39] to Joseph. Then it leaves somewhere
[1:23:41] there. Then again it goes to Judah.
[1:23:46] Then they come back to Joseph
[1:23:47] afterwards.
[1:23:49] So if you stop the other side, YOU DON'T
[1:23:52] KNOW WHAT the the story concludes with.
[1:23:56] And this is how the Bible is written.
[1:23:58] Even this is how the message is.
[1:24:01] Brother Brenham starts on this story. He
[1:24:04] leaves it halfway. He goes somewhere
[1:24:06] else. And that's how the Holy Ghost
[1:24:08] works.
[1:24:10] The same thing with discernment.
[1:24:13] People in the prayer line. One comes
[1:24:17] says now discerns him. But maybe he's
[1:24:21] talking to him. The Holy Ghost goes
[1:24:23] somewhere there. He leaves this one. Now
[1:24:26] you there this and this and this. Then
[1:24:28] from there, oh now this one here for you
[1:24:31] are here waiting.
[1:24:33] And that's how the scriptures are
[1:24:34] written. That's how the message is
[1:24:36] written.
[1:24:38] Praise the name of Lord. So you need to
[1:24:40] take time,
[1:24:43] read the message
[1:24:45] from the beginning, bring it to the end
[1:24:49] and get the right conclusions.
[1:24:53] Praise the name of Lord. That's how you
[1:24:55] we study.
[1:24:58] You don't just learn something and then
[1:24:59] you say,
[1:25:03] You take time and study.
[1:25:07] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:25:08] take time and study
[1:25:12] and we shall not be deceived.
[1:25:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Like you
[1:25:17] know when you read in the the book of
[1:25:19] Revelation,
[1:25:22] praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:25:23] these are interesting things.
[1:25:26] It teaches you what the scriptures are.
[1:25:32] Praise the name of I just want to pick
[1:25:35] something here.
[1:25:37] You know when you read in Revelations
[1:25:39] chapter 6,
[1:25:43] it brings in the first seal, second
[1:25:45] seal, the third seal, the fourth seal,
[1:25:49] the sixth seal. Praise the name of our
[1:25:51] Lord. Now after the sixth seal,
[1:25:56] and then you go to Revelations
[1:25:58] 7,
[1:26:01] He talks about the redemption of the
[1:26:03] Israel
[1:26:05] and then the redemption of the foolish
[1:26:07] virgin.
[1:26:10] Then he goes to Revelations chapter 8.
[1:26:15] Verse one. Then he says when he had
[1:26:18] opened the seventh seal,
[1:26:21] there was silence in heaven about the
[1:26:24] space of an hour
[1:26:29] and that seal is over.
[1:26:32] Then he starts I saw the seven angels
[1:26:35] given seven trumpets.
[1:26:44] So you need to get into the message of
[1:26:46] the hour
[1:26:49] to rightly
[1:26:52] to place these scriptures
[1:26:57] where they belong.
[1:27:00] Praise the name of our Lord. Brother
[1:27:02] Brenham, by the revelation of God,
[1:27:06] all these seven trumpets,
[1:27:10] they are sounded under the secret seal.
[1:27:16] Praise the name of God. But verse one
[1:27:18] says the seventh seal.
[1:27:22] Verse one says the seventh seal
[1:27:25] and then he goes back to the sixth seal.
[1:27:29] And then he talks about the trumpets.
[1:27:34] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[1:27:36] gets Revelation 10.
[1:27:38] He talks about Revelation the the
[1:27:40] seventh angel.
[1:27:44] Then he goes to Revelation 11.
[1:27:47] He goes back to the sixth seal.
[1:27:52] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:27:54] take time.
[1:27:56] Let us read the whole message.
[1:28:00] Start the book from the beginning. Bring
[1:28:02] it to an end. You not get the confusion
[1:28:05] you can get.
[1:28:07] Like when they read the message marriage
[1:28:09] and divorce,
[1:28:11] they pick one quote and then they move
[1:28:14] with that that
[1:28:16] they don't get the background
[1:28:19] and the conclusion.
[1:28:21] Praise the name of God. So to to avoid
[1:28:24] being deceived,
[1:28:27] read these message books.
[1:28:30] Praise the name of God. Read the message
[1:28:32] books.
[1:28:34] Don't stop at the quote which is quoted
[1:28:36] here at church.
[1:28:40] You can pick the quote.
[1:28:42] You can get the message and read it
[1:28:45] because we're not going to come and read
[1:28:47] the whole book before you.
[1:28:50] But we interest you
[1:28:55] that you go back. Why have I spent a lot
[1:28:58] of time on the message feast of the
[1:29:00] trumpet?
[1:29:01] You take time and say let me go and read
[1:29:03] it from the beginning.
[1:29:06] Praise the name of Lord. Take it and
[1:29:09] read it from the beginning.
[1:29:12] About 44 pages
[1:29:16] within two three hours you'll be done.
[1:29:20] Praise the name of the Lord. Let us go
[1:29:23] back and dig the message.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. The time
[1:29:29] maybe you are spending on your phone.
[1:29:33] Maybe every day you're spending seven
[1:29:34] hours,
[1:29:37] 10 hours
[1:29:38] or whatever hours.
[1:29:41] How much do you spend
[1:29:44] not on Facebook
[1:29:46] but on the message facing it
[1:29:50] reading your Bible? Praise the name of
[1:29:53] our Lord because God has given us this
[1:29:55] message.
[1:29:57] Brother Brham was reading books.
[1:30:01] He would see visions
[1:30:03] but he read.
[1:30:07] How about us?
[1:30:09] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:30:12] I had to read.
[1:30:14] I had to study and then write.
[1:30:19] Then he was telling Timothy
[1:30:22] study
[1:30:24] to show yourself approved.
[1:30:27] Now reading is not for the ministers
[1:30:29] only.
[1:30:32] Even you can read read
[1:30:35] if you can't read here.
[1:30:38] Praise the name of the Lord. So the
[1:30:40] message calls out the elect
[1:30:44] into the union with the Lord Jesus
[1:30:46] Christ.
[1:30:48] Praise the name of the Lord. I believe I
[1:30:50] should stop here.
[1:30:52] May God bless you.
[1:30:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:00] Let us sing that song as we can. Each of
[1:31:03] us pray.
