[51:23] think they are here really but I see m
[51:25] is there
[51:29] is now a blind
[51:31] brother and he doesn't hear much
[51:36] even those are all the consequences of
[51:38] old
[51:41] age I just want to thank God for
[51:45] today for what has brought us
[51:48] here we all know it is our

[53:36] gospel there is no way for you for us
[53:38] toore

[1:04:34] time we had a close relationship with
[1:04:38] him friendship with

[1:04:43] know but that was the
[1:04:47] beginning for my daughter to in the
[1:04:50] family of
[1:04:52] brother because after his departure
[1:04:57] we remain in communication in

[1:06:22] when Elijah was taking my daughter I had
[1:06:24] at least contributed 50%
[1:06:35] because Pastor really
[1:06:45] influenced if we can extend a little bit
[1:06:48] behind it's like our shade is moving the
[1:06:50] other side Pastors in this tent if we
[1:06:53] can move at the back a little bit
[1:06:59] start from the back because the shade is

[1:20:24] I would also like to
[1:20:28] mention um that by God's
[1:20:32] grace um we have walked with Pastor
[1:20:37] together him being our
[1:20:41] Father I remember one
[1:20:45] inent
[1:20:48] 201 when he lost his ability to speak
[1:20:55] while he was right at the
[1:20:58] ppit but God gave us
[1:21:01] Grace he caled
[1:21:04] down but in the next
[1:21:07] one which was still around
[1:21:12] 2017 were holding joint
[1:21:15] meetings they were visiting ministers
[1:21:18] from Ghana I
[1:21:22] think and then again while he was giving
[1:21:24] his appreciation
[1:21:27] remarks again heed
[1:21:31] out and we had to pick
[1:21:35] him wisely by God's
[1:21:39] grace let anyone
[1:21:42] know among those who are in the
[1:21:46] congregation and then
[1:21:49] later when the ministers who are there
[1:21:52] then
[1:21:54] for them they knew he's
[1:21:57] fine but for us we knew he's not
[1:22:01] fine so when they insisted and went with
[1:22:03] him to Rock
[1:22:05] [Music]
[1:22:07] Hotel I told them
[1:22:09] no man is
[1:22:13] unw he looked
[1:22:16] well they IGN Our
[1:22:19] advice but I followed on and then to
[1:22:22] show them he was not well
[1:22:26] I picked a note of 50,000
[1:22:30] shs from his
[1:22:33] pocket and I asked
[1:22:36] himor how much is
[1:22:38] this and he told me
[1:22:42] 1 so we quickly picked him from
[1:22:46] there with Elijah his first
[1:22:50] born and we took him home
[1:22:54] that time the ones who are with him the
[1:22:57] ministers must have remained
[1:23:02] grumbling but we are trying to keep that
[1:23:06] away
[1:23:08] from hoping that he's going to get
[1:23:12] well so that went
[1:23:15] on during
[1:23:18] baptism so when he became
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:21] free now he would call
[1:23:24] feel that coming that
[1:23:28] blackout he would say get me brother so
[1:23:30] and so to take me
[1:23:33] home yeah so that's how we moved with

[1:46:28] diio I don't know whether it
[1:46:31] was
[1:46:37] who I don't
[1:46:39] remember and I remember I think we took
[1:46:42] a a
[1:46:45] photo either in the it was a brother
[1:46:48] knows
[1:46:50] better we were like a basketball
[1:46:56] field because it was all
[1:46:59] cement
[1:47:01] girls and the sun was too
[1:47:04] much I not really open my eyes
[1:47:09] well that is
[1:47:11] when I gave out my sister to the late
[1:47:17] Pastor it was May 1982
[1:47:27] and sister
[1:47:30] Ruth
[1:47:33] uh is a
[1:47:36] daughter to our mom
[1:47:42] pris who is a retired
[1:47:47] nurse from hospital
[1:47:54] and his
[1:47:57] dad was
[1:47:59] asp
[1:48:02] asp James Patrick I mean John Patrick VI
[1:48:07] John
[1:48:08] Patrick so sister Ruth sister Ruth from
[1:48:12] the day he she
[1:48:15] married she never came back home with
[1:48:20] luggages that the husband just
[1:48:24] her so from that
[1:48:27] day when she
[1:48:29] saw that she will be with him to the
[1:48:34] last and indeed she has made the
[1:48:50] vow sister Ruth sister
[1:48:53] thank you for being a good
[1:48:57] wife in that you have stayed with your
[1:48:59] husband
[1:49:02] to thank you very
[1:49:05] much we want to sister
[1:49:10] brother has left us with six
[1:49:15] children four boys and two
[1:49:19] girls and he has left grandchild
[1:49:23] children four of
[1:49:27] them so we don't want to say we are
[1:49:30] morning
[1:49:34] brother but we want to Cate
[1:49:39] brother because he has
[1:49:42] left footsteps on the SS of
[1:49:48] time and
[1:49:50] brother indeed has been a time
[1:49:57] Minister who have been traveling in many
[1:50:02] places together with
[1:50:05] Pastor when they came back I remember
[1:50:07] Pastor I giving us a
[1:50:11] testimony that when they reached the
[1:50:13] border of Z and
[1:50:18] Uganda they were they had put on their
[1:50:21] ties and courts
[1:50:25] anding on
[1:50:26] theorder they were told to put on
[1:50:30] T-shirts because the way they were
[1:50:33] dressed it was only for his Excellence
[1:50:35] the other
[1:50:39] side so when he came back
[1:50:42] home said Daddy why have you dressed a
[1:50:48] t-shirt there was almost being fire
[1:50:50] there
[1:50:55] so we thank you men of
[1:50:58] God for the TRS you went
[1:51:04] through has been in
[1:51:08] Toro and he has a home
[1:51:11] there but because he's been a fulltime
[1:51:16] Minister it would be very hard to have
[1:51:19] two
[1:51:21] homes and the time when he plan to have
[1:51:24] a
[1:51:25] home is when he fell
[1:51:28] sick because I
[1:51:30] remember I think three
[1:51:32] times looking for
[1:51:35] land for him to
[1:51:37] construct because he had told me that
[1:51:41] he's coming
[1:51:43] old so he wanted a country
[1:51:47] home leave other for the
[1:51:50] children but then he could not make
[1:51:53] it because of the
[1:51:56] sickness so we want to thank
[1:52:00] God for the
[1:52:02] family for the support you have
[1:52:06] done to bring us to this
[1:52:09] place praise the Lord the little you
[1:52:12] have put
[1:52:13] in has brought us to this
[1:52:16] place we want to
[1:52:19] thank for the mission work
[1:52:23] because the mission
[1:52:25] work is what almost led us this
[1:52:30] place maybe if this church was not
[1:52:34] there we wouldn't know there was land in
[1:52:37] this
[1:52:38] area so it is missionary
[1:52:42] work that brought this church
[1:52:44] here which has brought the family
[1:52:49] here thank
[1:52:51] God that
[1:52:53] we are not laying the body of brother
[1:52:56] Charles here and
[1:53:02] live the reason why we brought the
[1:53:04] barrier to
[1:53:08] today is that we wanted to have some
[1:53:11] time to do some
[1:53:15] construction so we have a house in
[1:53:17] construction
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:20] already praise the Lord the house is we
[1:53:23] just want to put on the beam next week
[1:53:25] we are going to
[1:53:29] roof it's not that maybe didn't
[1:53:33] care he
[1:53:35] really but you know the life of a
[1:53:39] minister you never sit with
[1:53:43] money you can even borrow to help a
[1:53:49] Believer you borrow in the house there
[1:53:51] is demand for Fe and the
[1:53:55] rest you go and help
[1:53:58] the unless you are not a cold
[1:54:04] Minister just how to eat from the sheep
[1:54:07] and you don't give
[1:54:10] back but we for
[1:54:14] brother he has with his
[1:54:33] ministers do some
[1:54:37] study about
[1:54:42] prophet and prophet
[1:54:45] Samuel they were permanent or fulltime
[1:54:48] ministers
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:52] but the home was not
[1:54:57] there stud about
[1:55:01] that so
[1:55:03] because we want to appreciate everyone
[1:55:08] inde all your support since the brother
[1:55:11] Charles fell
[1:55:14] sick all your prayers and

[2:11:58] late
[2:12:00] brother because I know it's a sorrowful
[2:12:04] moment at this material
[2:12:06] moment because he has left a very big
[2:12:10] gap both to the biological families and
[2:12:13] also the
[2:12:18] in-laws and also the grandchildren
[2:12:22] just
[2:12:23] briefly
[2:12:26] Pastor was born from
[2:12:31] West in in
[2:12:35] 19550
[2:12:36] 50
[2:12:39] s and uh briefly he started his primary
[2:12:44] education
[2:12:49] in but how did he come to
[2:12:57] our with our late mother
[2:13:04] reu uh they were
[2:13:07] missionaries my dad was
[2:13:10] AER in Protestant
[2:13:13] church and first letter second letter
[2:13:16] and third
[2:13:18] letter but how did he come to B
[2:13:23] because because Char started from buo
[2:13:26] and he was born from
[2:13:29] West in
[2:13:33] Village zbo
[2:13:36] District that is our cestal
[2:13:40] home we have a very big
[2:13:44] family and others migrated
[2:13:48] Ino including our tribes
[2:13:53] so the people of our tribe
[2:13:58] in requested the
[2:14:03] Das to write to
[2:14:07] West to appoint a preacher a missionary
[2:14:11] to come too to preach in the local
[2:14:17] language and the vote landed on my dad
[2:14:22] and they gave him a letter that Mr
[2:14:24] Gideon you are being sent B to preach
[2:14:27] the Gospel of Jesus
[2:14:32] Christ he said I am not going
[2:14:36] too send him the second
[2:14:39] letter when Jonah refused to go to n
[2:14:42] whated to
[2:14:45] him he had the
[2:14:48] answer he told the wife please let us
[2:14:52] go you know what happened to
[2:14:56] Jonah and they crossed through Lake
[2:15:01] Albert
[2:15:03] to and started preaching the Gospel of
[2:15:06] Jesus Christ in the religion of
[2:15:08] protestant
[2:15:10] church it's from there that Charles oio
[2:15:15] started his primary level
[2:15:19] education and they came
[2:15:21] with it is fromo that where I was
[2:15:25] born also my sister was born there we
[2:15:28] three children were born
[2:15:30] Ino one
[2:15:32] died so CH started from the up
[2:15:38] p7 and when he completed his primary
[2:15:41] living
[2:15:43] examination he passed high grade
[2:15:47] one he was admitted in cabala
[2:15:53] [Music]
[2:15:54] S I don't know it is unfortunate or
[2:15:59] fortunately his was replaced by a rich
[2:16:02] man's
[2:16:06] son by that
[2:16:08] time our second born I can say is the
[2:16:12] first born from a
[2:16:15] dad he was already working in
[2:16:19] t Hospital as a clerical
[2:16:24] officer he said now I'm going to take
[2:16:28] you you stud from here it's from where
[2:16:32] he was admitted in Rock
[2:16:35] High where he studed his education and
[2:16:41] completed during his period in that
[2:16:45] school it's why he believed this
[2:16:48] message and he was preaching the Gospel
[2:16:51] of Jesus
[2:16:54] Christ right away he started preaching
[2:16:56] the gospel
[2:17:00] seriously in class outside moving his
[2:17:06] Bible our brother here was transferred
[2:17:09] to
[2:17:12] KAG and he told the let us go to
[2:17:16] KAG say no I have got my people here
[2:17:21] I can't get lost I let me stay in
[2:17:24] t you go to
[2:17:26] KAG so he remained in
[2:17:30] T and that's why he started
[2:17:36] preaching and uh many people have given
[2:17:39] testimonies about
[2:17:42] him and I wanted to also tell you one
[2:17:46] thing our mommy
[2:17:49] died when he died
[2:17:52] Charles told me
[2:17:55] personally that he prayed to God where
[2:17:58] did you take our
[2:18:02] mom he was already a believer in the
[2:18:06] message and God told
[2:18:09] him that your
[2:18:11] mom is waiting you in the Eastern
[2:18:18] Gate he said what is Easter
[2:18:26] gate and God revealed
[2:18:29] him the Eastern
[2:18:33] Gate the place of the rightous
[2:18:36] people and your is waiting you in the
[2:18:40] instant
[2:18:44] Gates they have met in the right
[2:18:49] place another great thing he has done in
[2:18:52] our in the ministry in our
[2:18:55] family when our dad Gideon visited him
[2:19:03] in he believed the
[2:19:08] message so our daddy died after
[2:19:10] believing the
[2:19:13] message he was
[2:19:16] baptized by pastors white men
[2:19:25] and when he went back to
[2:19:26] Village the protest says you are
[2:19:31] lost he said no I'm not
[2:19:34] lost I have received something in myself
[2:19:37] I'm the one benefiting
[2:19:41] it you who has not received you're not
[2:19:46] benefiting amen so I also like to serve
[2:19:49] God
[2:19:52] that when he was he became a pastor here
[2:19:54] in
[2:19:55] Toro I managed to visit him
[2:19:59] also it's from where I met Pastor
[2:20:04] MAA who also participated in in my
[2:20:10] salvation because he stayed long at the
[2:20:13] home of the
[2:20:16] pastor and I met him
[2:20:18] there and busy preaching to
[2:20:21] me and I was
[2:20:24] touched I was already police
[2:20:27] officer but later shortly enough I told
[2:20:31] the pastors that now I want to get
[2:20:38] saved within two
[2:20:41] days there was a brother
[2:20:44] called there was one who baptized me was
[2:20:47] a Bame
[2:20:52] he baptized me in Riv going
[2:20:58] to and the water was very
[2:21:05] dir he asked me only one
[2:21:07] question do you understand water
[2:21:12] baptism I said yes because I've been
[2:21:15] having first services in the same church
[2:21:18] they knew what baptism is
[2:21:22] I say I
[2:21:23] believe and he baptized me in that water
[2:21:28] so I never mind is
[2:21:31] dir much
[2:21:37] water and I went back to my C when my
[2:21:40] life was totally
[2:21:44] changed which I've never experienced
[2:21:49] before so I like to
[2:21:53] appreciate on behalf of this
[2:21:58] family uh to appreciate all those who
[2:22:03] participated
[2:22:05] in our our late
[2:22:09] brother he has been also a very good
[2:22:11] friend of
[2:22:13] mine and most of time Consulting
[2:22:17] him and some of the information he gave
[2:22:21] me I may not deliver it
[2:22:25] here but he had a
[2:22:29] plan and I appreciate
[2:22:34] God that he married the best woman in
[2:22:36] the
[2:22:41] world and I saw the
[2:22:45] fruit and uh she has been good to us
[2:22:50] very good can welcome
[2:22:55] visitors
[2:22:57] and how he was persistently taking care
[2:23:01] of our
[2:23:06] brother so that what has touched me also
[2:23:09] very
[2:23:11] much and
[2:23:13] uh he has a home that is that is a home
[2:23:16] in t where has built a permanent house
[2:23:21] that was his first
[2:23:24] plan the first plan is bought a plot in
[2:23:29] Toro build it in a way ofas and then he
[2:23:32] was having to build a main one I was
[2:23:35] present when he were giving the
[2:23:39] planning that house is
[2:23:42] there but he had a second
[2:23:44] plan to come to this
[2:23:47] Village and he told me we me and my
[2:23:52] families we want to build in this
[2:23:57] Village so that all my children will be
[2:24:00] coming here and that one becomes a
[2:24:02] business
[2:24:05] house
[2:24:09] that but I think now because of the
[2:24:13] sickness and I I didn't follow it
[2:24:18] much because I have to be very say about
[2:24:23] it but I have to
[2:24:26] appreciate our first the first
[2:24:32] of for
[2:24:36] the driving him taking to
[2:24:40] hospital checking the the temperature
[2:24:43] pressure all the time
[2:24:51] for the evil
[2:24:55] that the wife
[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:23] and I want to summarize by saying
[2:25:27] this uh on behalf of the families who
[2:25:31] are
[2:25:33] touched you know uh we are two
[2:25:38] things we are message
[2:25:42] Believers and you know things of culture
[2:25:45] are quite different from the message
[2:25:50] but uh I believe that we shall have a
[2:25:52] family
[2:25:54] meeting just as a family
[2:25:58] later maybe after these
[2:26:02] programs we shall have a
[2:26:04] meeting discuss about
[2:26:06] it I'd like to thank Pastor
[2:26:11] I for the effort that he has done with
[2:26:14] his
[2:26:15] families all the
[2:26:18] inlaws the friends
[2:26:21] all
[2:26:22] pastors consing our de
[2:26:25] brother for the evil that they have
[2:26:27] done lastly but not
[2:26:30] least I appreciate our
[2:26:33] mama for being uh a good
[2:26:38] lady for keeping our brother in the last
[2:26:43] moment we heard all
[2:26:46] testimonies of what God has decided that
[2:26:50] he should go and
[2:26:53] rest even now even if you tell him back
[2:26:56] he said no I'm not coming
[2:26:59] back but I pray that let him be an
[2:27:03] example to both
[2:27:06] families including the children the
[2:27:11] orphans including us here the
[2:27:15] families because he was a lovely brother
[2:27:22] our dad was also a man of families he
[2:27:26] could have many people in welcoming
[2:27:29] everyone not even mind whether is which
[2:27:32] tribe he a man who loves everyone I used
[2:27:35] to be surprised for
[2:27:37] that some of the characters come from
[2:27:40] our
[2:27:42] dad and I've never seen my dad beating
[2:27:45] my
[2:27:48] mom and this made not even to slap or
[2:27:51] annoy my wife or to beat

[2:29:52] brother Dr
[2:29:54] Moses and brother
[2:29:57] Isaac walked with him the
[2:29:59] journey so I want to give them 3 minutes
[2:30:03] just to give us a
[2:30:08] [Music]
[2:30:15] report praise God
[2:30:21] so um we know that uh our dear pastor
[2:30:25] had been ill for some
[2:30:30] time
[2:30:32] and the main issue being that his
[2:30:34] kidneys were not really
[2:30:44] work so before he had been receiving uh
[2:30:49] what we call dialysis like an artificial
[2:30:52] kidney that would do the work for him at
[2:30:54] least twice a
[2:30:59] week um but the disease is always
[2:31:06] progressing so by the time he got
[2:31:09] admitted to I think on
[2:31:15] Friday at that time he wasn't doing well
[2:31:18] and the pressures were quite
[2:31:24] low but from the test that we had
[2:31:28] done with the of
[2:31:33] brothery specialist that seen
[2:31:37] [Music]
[2:31:39] him the toxins were very
[2:31:44] high and uh they were making the heart
[2:31:47] not to work well so it needed a bit of
[2:31:49] support
[2:31:56] time to
[2:32:01] theive but he also needed to have dialis
[2:32:08] urgently and thealis that he needed at
[2:32:11] that
[2:32:13] time was not the type that he had been
[2:32:16] getting before
[2:32:20] so at least uh were able to talk to some
[2:32:24] of the people and we had already planned
[2:32:26] to have a the
[2:32:33] dialis because it needed to take a much
[2:32:36] longer
[2:32:39] time and we also needed to First give
[2:32:42] him some medicine to support
[2:32:46] the
[2:32:48] which we had
[2:32:52] started but everything was still hanging
[2:32:55] in
[2:32:57] Balance we really thank God that uh at
[2:33:03] least for whatever we
[2:33:06] needed when we
[2:33:09] requested the people at the hospital
[2:33:11] tried to make sure that it's
[2:33:16] available so but unfortunately that
[2:33:18] evening after starting all the
[2:33:20] treatments while we were preparing to
[2:33:22] let him have
[2:33:26] theing toxin just kept accumulating and
[2:33:29] the pressures were really
[2:33:33] low so on Monday in the
[2:33:38] night um he was not able to make it
[2:33:43] UNT it was um very difficult
[2:33:49] uh but we really thank God for the teams
[2:33:51] that were
[2:33:53] available um and especially the medical
[2:33:56] team at
[2:33:59] [Music]
[2:34:00] Mulo because they were very
[2:34:03] helpful they made sure that we have
[2:34:07] whatever it is that we requested for
[2:34:11] whatever and when we took the body to to
[2:34:15] the mer
[2:34:18] [Music]
[2:34:19] when we took the body to
[2:34:23] the um they were also able to ensure
[2:34:27] that we have whatever we needed without
[2:34:29] giving us
[2:34:33] time requested us to tell them what we
[2:34:36] wanted and they made sure
[2:34:39] that so we really thank
[2:34:42] God that at least in terms of the care
[2:34:45] that we needed or that we could give at
[2:34:48] that point in time
[2:34:53] were able to
[2:34:56] access even though it was not as easy to
[2:35:02] ex but all you
[2:35:05] know we thank God for the
[2:35:08] opportunity specifically gave to
[2:35:11] us to stand in with our
[2:35:18] De le have personally known him ever
[2:35:21] since I was a little
[2:35:26] child very good friend to my
[2:35:30] father I remember he's the one who
[2:35:32] actually preached the laston when my
[2:35:34] father was being laid to
[2:35:38] rest so we really thank God at least he
[2:35:41] gave us the
[2:35:45] opportunity May rest inace
[2:35:54] um thank you for that
[2:35:57] report but I wanted you to explain it a
[2:36:00] bit clearly yes when you say somebody
[2:36:03] may think our pastor was poisoned oh so
[2:36:06] let me explain I'm I'm a nsman I'm not a
[2:36:10] scientist but I've studied conflict
[2:36:12] sensitive
[2:36:13] communication now when you eat or
[2:36:18] drink God has designed that there are
[2:36:21] systems in your
[2:36:23] body absorb what is
[2:36:27] useful and what is useless you it or you
[2:36:32] [Music]
[2:36:34] it systems fail to separate the
[2:36:40] two what if it remains in your
[2:36:44] body it becomes the English call it
[2:36:47] toxins but this side called it poison
[2:36:51] it BEC poison for
[2:36:53] the they've
[2:36:56] me got it
[2:36:59] correct I wanted to be affirmed

[2:41:50] it is
[2:41:52] well it is

[2:41:58] Well with My
[2:42:07] Soul God bless
[2:42:10] you I want to thank you
[2:42:13] for uh appearing here
[2:42:16] and having to send our dad
[2:42:26] and I know I'm not the only one to speak
[2:42:30] because Dad was not having only one
[2:42:35] child but
[2:42:38] I give just a brief
[2:42:44] hint you know that
[2:42:46] is expense for dialis is
[2:42:50] quite quite a d i mean quite
[2:42:57] expensive on a
[2:43:00] normal on a normal session or
[2:43:05] [Music]
[2:43:07] situation you could need about 500,000 a
[2:43:14] week now that is if he doesn't fall sick
[2:43:18] or or other things if if you're not ke
[2:43:22] on but on a normal session you will need
[2:43:24] about 500 every
[2:43:30] week so it was quite a hustle to get
[2:43:35] that
[2:43:38] money but we had very many supportive
[2:43:42] Brethren
[2:43:45] around and I would like to give special
[2:43:49] thanks
[2:43:56] to I would also like to thank Pastor I
[2:44:01] don't know whether he's around
[2:44:05] here and
[2:44:08] also and and Believers around for
[2:44:12] example when we're in
[2:44:15] t you know diis centers are not in
[2:44:22] so when D would get
[2:44:25] sick for maybe a particular
[2:44:29] issue Believers would come
[2:44:33] in and also since I'm
[2:44:38] online I also want to give special
[2:44:41] thanks to brother mang of
[2:44:46] Canada and Pastor god of
[2:44:51] who are very supportive
[2:44:53] in other this this exp can't be managed
[2:44:58] by one single
[2:45:01] person even if you're outside the
[2:45:05] country kind of
[2:45:08] collective and you know in terms of flow
[2:45:11] of
[2:45:13] cash especially if it is coming from
[2:45:17] out and you want the answers
[2:45:20] now you'll be in a
[2:45:24] mess so that's the brief history about
[2:45:29] it and including other issues of uh of
[2:45:36] dad he was an example to the
[2:45:42] family to
[2:45:44] me is
[2:45:46] a okay I don't want to put him in the
[2:45:49] place of
[2:45:51] God I know God is my
[2:45:54] rock but after him I was always looking
[2:45:57] at
[2:45:59] that
[2:46:02] very when when when he when he knows
[2:46:04] something is the
[2:46:07] truth no no power of hell can di him
[2:46:10] from
[2:46:13] it and that is the Legacy
[2:46:20] that I hope to push forward
[2:46:24] hence I know when Satan when when Jesus
[2:46:29] died on the
[2:46:30] cross you know all hell was
[2:46:34] celebrating they think they thought
[2:46:36] everything was
[2:46:38] over but Jesus had a stinger
[2:46:43] missile within no
[2:46:46] time hell was quaking
[2:46:49] so he may be lying
[2:46:52] there and you think things are just
[2:46:55] there but there are seeds
[2:46:59] everywhere and there is more
[2:47:03] determination to bring down the Gates of
[2:47:09] [Applause]
[2:47:12] Hell God bless
[2:47:15] you thank you for
[2:47:17] coming i' would like to thank everyone
[2:47:20] for whatever support you've done for my

[2:56:10] Father for being such an
[2:56:14] example I remember when I was tender
[2:56:21] and um I wanted to give my life to
[2:56:28] Christ so I asked myself a
[2:56:32] question how does uh Christian
[2:56:39] behave and
[2:56:42] then I started watching the life of my
[2:56:45] father
[2:56:48] Baba and my
[2:56:51] mom and yes I
[2:56:53] saw I saw
[2:56:57] something I really saw
[2:57:01] Jesus and yes I gave my life to
[2:57:05] Christ on theas
[2:57:10] that Dad has been a loving person
[2:57:16] [Music]
[2:57:20] yes he has been loving to
[2:57:24] everyone you couldn't know
[2:57:27] his
[2:57:34] enemy I think that's an example
[2:57:38] of
[2:57:41] SE yeah in
[2:57:43] Christ mature seed in Christ mature
[2:57:47] Christian
[2:57:50] [Music]
[2:57:53] I want to thank
[2:57:56] everyone who supported
[2:58:03] usally
[2:58:06] emotionally I also want to thank our
[2:58:08] elder
[2:58:10] brother for the sacrifices he
[2:58:13] made I want to thank also my entire
[2:58:16] family here
[2:58:20] we all sacrificed for
[2:58:25] Daddy and uh I know Daddy is not
[2:58:31] dead but he's
[2:58:34] resting and I have I am
[2:58:40] assured that I will see him
[2:58:44] again thank you all I miss you daddy
[2:58:50] but I'll see you
[2:58:53] again God bless
[2:58:56] you Moses his youngest
[2:59:01] child uh we have come a long
[2:59:04] way there many of us have learned a lot
[2:59:07] from him he has been examplary to all of
[2:59:12] us has been a friend and a mentor
[2:59:20] the most important thing is that I
[2:59:21] learned a lot of
[2:59:25] him he was preaching a lot
[2:59:28] so some things we don't get because he
[2:59:32] used to bring in many ministers and
[2:59:37] preach so but there are some things I
[2:59:40] learned from him
[2:59:41] about
[2:59:46] Simplicity he preached about
[2:59:49] Simplicity it's not
[2:59:51] about be having nothing but it's about
[2:59:55] being
[2:59:59] humble so some I reflected on some of
[3:00:02] the thoughts he used to talk to us every
[3:00:07] night he taught us to
[3:00:10] pray and he also talked about one of his
[3:00:14] sermons all his well
[3:00:19] so when you reflect on that you see no

[3:32:09] late so we appreciate all of
[3:32:13] you and I want to say a few words about
[3:32:16] brother
[3:32:18] Charles you see when the gospel
[3:32:21] came uh we know we had Jerusalem where
[3:32:25] the Holy Spirit
[3:32:27] came F the
[3:32:31] 120 and uh the gospel was preached that
[3:32:34] same
[3:32:35] day thousands were
[3:32:42] preached yeah thousands were baptized
[3:32:47] and we appreciate God for
[3:32:50] Jerusalem but then there are some other
[3:32:53] places like
[3:32:57] Antiochus which had a totally different
[3:33:01] beginning which had nothing to do with
[3:33:06] Jerusalem Jerusalem here is T
[3:33:11] College
[3:33:13] brother God bless you so much
[3:33:16] you have been an icon of
[3:33:19] Faith you are the first
[3:33:22] Pastor in the
[3:33:24] country which we can call the Jerusalem
[3:33:27] of
[3:33:28] faith and I would want also to say
[3:33:34] brother I could relate him to I mean to
[3:33:38] Antioch they had nothing to do with
[3:33:42] Jerusalem but still it was the same
[3:33:44] faith
[3:33:46] and from
[3:33:48] brother he baptized me I knew him when
[3:33:52] he was putting on
[3:33:54] shorts and
[3:33:57] sand he me to the
[3:34:00] Lord amen I appreciate that
[3:34:04] man I baptized brother
[3:34:09] Ben one of the very first
[3:34:13] converts and the three of us
[3:34:16] we became a
[3:34:18] trinity as the people desired to call
[3:34:21] us and so we appreciate
[3:34:24] God for the way he used our
[3:34:28] brother he Tau me one
[3:34:31] thing that in the gospel we are not on
[3:34:35] competition everybody has his own
[3:34:39] call he taught me to be very humble when
[3:34:44] you are handling the word
[3:34:46] he told me I don't have a heaven where I
[3:34:51] take the people the people must be
[3:34:55] taken to the word the word to perfect
[3:34:59] them prepare them for a heaven that's
[3:35:03] general for all of
[3:35:06] us so you don't cut off a
[3:35:09] piece and say these are my people those
[3:35:13] are my people we are one b in Christ
[3:35:17] saved by the same gospel filled by the
[3:35:20] same Holy Spirit must be filled with the
[3:35:23] same kind of
[3:35:25] spirit that brought this message to us
[3:35:29] amen humble
[3:35:31] humility having a soft
[3:35:35] Spirit when we are preaching we are not
[3:35:38] making War to
[3:35:40] anybody no we are trying to do the best
[3:35:43] we
[3:35:44] can bring the people to the
[3:35:47] Lord that was the man that I
[3:35:51] knew he was known by a sweet
[3:35:55] Spirit he would look at
[3:35:58] you um brother
[3:36:00] St I think that one will live to the
[3:36:05] Lord I've always
[3:36:08] learned to live it to the
[3:36:10] Lord you never hear many
[3:36:13] battles when they throw
[3:36:17] I don't throw back I've learned from
[3:36:20] Brother
[3:36:22] Charles amen so he had the
[3:36:26] ability to call somebody who didn't
[3:36:28] believe
[3:36:30] him a friend you see there's no reason
[3:36:34] why we call
[3:36:36] names it's not necessary even when Judas
[3:36:41] came to kill Christ Jesus stand and says
[3:36:47] friend why have you
[3:36:52] come that
[3:36:59] was I just want to say one
[3:37:03] thing that one
[3:37:06] time as I don't want to spend time
[3:37:12] here we went to Congo
[3:37:16] it was me
[3:37:19] brother

[3:38:23] using and they reached a
[3:38:25] bridge and the car just

[3:38:30] nothing it's like something pushed the
[3:38:34] car and now when they brought it back up

[3:47:33] righteous is taken away from the evil to
[3:47:36] come
[3:47:47] he shall enter into
[3:47:49] peace in their beds each one walking in
[3:47:53] his
[3:48:05] uprightness let's be seated
[3:48:14] I want to take this opportunity to thank
[3:48:17] everybody who has
[3:48:21] come and everybody who has said good
[3:48:26] things in memory of our precious
[3:48:32] brother thank you for reminding you of
[3:48:35] the things our brother was uh given to
[3:48:39] Earth and he has done faithfully
[3:48:48] I'm one of those who benefited a lot
[3:48:50] from
[3:48:53] him
[3:48:56] Ministry and a part of his
[3:49:00] ministry uh gotten into
[3:49:05] me uh I thank God for the
[3:49:08] love God gave
[3:49:11] him I thank God for The Good Wife
[3:49:15] the lord gave
[3:49:18] him a good wife behind a good
[3:49:22] man a successful
[3:49:26] Ministry I've stayed with sister Ruth
[3:49:30] Andor for some
[3:49:36] time I speak what
[3:49:40] I I'm a married man
[3:49:44] I appreciate God for my
[3:49:49] wife but there's something special I
[3:49:52] learned from Sister Ruth before I got
[3:49:58] married she's a sister whom I knew she
[3:50:02] was not overtaken by
[3:50:07] pressure situations were
[3:50:11] difficult sacrificed a lot
[3:50:16] for the church for
[3:50:19] believers and he was not a person who
[3:50:22] gave in his faith for
[3:50:27] anything there are many things he
[3:50:31] refused for the
[3:50:34] faith and that denied the
[3:50:37] family espcially the sister which she
[3:50:40] would
[3:50:42] enjoy because he was was after the
[3:50:47] faith you know sometimes we think
[3:50:50] Christianity is
[3:50:53] simple just enter and become a
[3:50:58] Christian as long as you
[3:51:01] confess but Christianity is a life of
[3:51:04] terrible ups and
[3:51:08] downs and it is worse when you
[3:51:12] Minister and it is wor when Minister
[3:51:16] turns
[3:51:22] wife many of them have cried and
[3:51:26] sobbed because of what what their
[3:51:29] husbands go
[3:51:31] through I thank God for
[3:51:36] sister God bless you so
[3:51:40] much I want to thank God today
[3:51:45] I know many of you ministers are
[3:51:48] wondering what is happening
[3:51:52] today when an important person like this
[3:51:56] rests we expect an international
[3:51:59] minister
[3:52:02] to to come and Minister because he has
[3:52:05] gone to various
[3:52:09] places or would expect one of you
[3:52:14] who have blessed people more than
[3:52:19] me to come and stand here you
[3:52:25] surprise but don't take the surprise too
[3:52:32] far because sometimes God does
[3:52:35] things which you can't understand and
[3:52:38] you can't ask him
[3:52:41] why so accept the situation
[3:52:46] thank
[3:52:49] God the one standing
[3:52:53] [Applause]
[3:52:56] here we want to than
[3:53:00] God that He gave us the best in this
[3:53:05] world he gave us his own
[3:53:09] son if he us any man
[3:53:14] we would have
[3:53:17] wrecked would have have caused an
[3:53:22] accident because human beings are very
[3:53:30] difficult and I want to say
[3:53:32] this that every every place where God
[3:53:38] steps sat goes
[3:53:42] there and either family
[3:53:52] chch to make things look
[3:53:55] different until people will
[3:53:58] say we thought this are the people who
[3:54:01] say they have
[3:54:04] God but what is
[3:54:07] happening it's not the people but Satan
[3:54:11] knows our
[3:54:12] attitude so he come to use our
[3:54:16] attitudes but thank God that even when
[3:54:19] the SAT
[3:54:21] comes God does not move away from his
[3:54:25] Covenant he stays with his
[3:54:28] people and we are sure God will stay
[3:54:32] with
[3:54:33] us until he crosses us
[3:54:38] over praise God just need faith
[3:54:45] uh after word of
[3:54:47] prayer I want to say like two three
[3:54:51] things that would be
[3:54:54] mymon yeah bear with it the way to
[3:54:58] come I don't me it be
[3:55:01] rough
[3:55:04] but but God I pray he takes over let's
[3:55:08] pray precious father we thank you that
[3:55:11] we are
[3:55:12] here we thank you for our
[3:55:15] brother he came here for a
[3:55:18] purpose and he has finished the
[3:55:21] purpose he would have been taken
[3:55:25] prematurely are hearing of the
[3:55:28] testim but you kept him until the work
[3:55:32] is over the work in his family the work
[3:55:36] in the
[3:55:37] ministry and his church and when you
[3:55:40] close this you open another door we are
[3:55:44] sure there is another door that you are
[3:55:47] opening for the family for the church
[3:55:51] and for the ministry nothing is going to
[3:55:54] fail we thank you Father that you kept
[3:55:57] our brother
[3:55:59] faithful kept the the faith kept the
[3:56:04] word ran the rest
[3:56:07] successfully and now he's at home we are
[3:56:11] not guessing we are basing on fact
[3:56:15] that have come to us while we alive and
[3:56:18] you have shown us you can work with a
[3:56:21] man
[3:56:22] here and you yourself take his
[3:56:25] hand and cross him over thank you Father
[3:56:30] Lord as we speak this few words I pray
[3:56:33] to I beg to C to leave the Gap to step
[3:56:38] out and you come and take over and
[3:56:42] respect your children in the name of our
[3:56:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[3:56:47] we blessed be the name of the
[3:56:49] Lord the grace of
[3:56:52] God is such a thing we can't
[3:56:56] explain even here when the Bible
[3:56:59] reads I want to talk about the
[3:57:02] grace but I want to thank God before I
[3:57:06] go
[3:57:07] far I want to thank God for
[3:57:11] brother in a very special way
[3:57:16] [Applause]
[3:57:18] uh to
[3:57:20] me I'm a person
[3:57:23] who uh I don't have attraction to
[3:57:29] people I
[3:57:31] don't not that I I don't want to I want
[3:57:35] I love
[3:57:39] friends I love
[3:57:43] friends but
[3:57:45] I love genuine
[3:57:49] friends and the only way I can be
[3:57:54] one is when we are friends in the
[3:57:59] word because if we start friendship on
[3:58:03] money my friend will not
[3:58:07] stand I be at your
[3:58:11] door it's very difficult I don't know
[3:58:14] whether it is your
[3:58:16] experience it's very difficult to have a
[3:58:19] friend who is a who is poorer than
[3:58:23] you because he will your friendship on
[3:58:26] what you
[3:58:28] have but thank God that there's
[3:58:32] something God has given
[3:58:33] us that can help us to lean on one
[3:58:38] another loves the
[3:58:41] word and whenever he comes around
[3:58:45] you it's all about the
[3:58:48] word not about the people about the word
[3:58:52] of
[3:58:54] Christ and I think that's the best
[3:58:57] attitude we should
[3:59:01] have a person who can tell you the
[3:59:06] truth and that's how they have stayed
[3:59:09] with Pastor
[3:59:10] oio that was what brother oio was
[3:59:15] when I was having problems of where to
[3:59:17] to be after coming from
[3:59:23] Kenya I found peace
[3:59:29] 1989
[3:59:31] Church praise God
[3:59:35] brother he on the
[3:59:37] street is in the house whether sharing
[3:59:41] another
[3:59:43] point is on the
[3:59:45] word a man who
[3:59:47] spoke a man who wrote about it there are
[3:59:51] many things he wrote about the
[3:59:54] message he spoke he wrote he
[3:59:59] preached I love the saturation of the
[4:00:02] grace of God on the word he
[4:00:08] had I don't believe that the weaknesses
[4:00:11] he had
[4:00:14] make us turn away from
[4:00:18] him but that is what we are and that
[4:00:21] what I
[4:00:23] am that's why God sent his grace to
[4:00:27] us so the Bible tells us that the
[4:00:31] righteous
[4:00:33] perishes and no man lay it on his onay
[4:00:38] it to
[4:00:39] heart and merciful men are taken away
[4:00:44] none considering that the righteous is
[4:00:47] taken away
[4:00:49] from to
[4:00:52] come even if we would take talk good
[4:00:57] things still there would be
[4:01:00] hurs that will not side with what we are
[4:01:05] talking they always
[4:01:08] there even if we saw good things even if
[4:01:11] we give out good things
[4:01:14] we have here pastors here who have
[4:01:18] helped
[4:01:19] people they have done a
[4:01:22] lot praise God like our pastor
[4:01:27] here we are he pastor and other
[4:01:32] pastors let me tell you even if you give
[4:01:36] even your
[4:01:38] life you not please all
[4:01:41] people and when you hear Nega
[4:01:46] never believe you
[4:01:50] are because we are we shall never be the
[4:01:54] same someone will help
[4:01:57] him and come and say he took from the M
[4:02:00] he
[4:02:03] had so if he had little he wouldn't have
[4:02:07] given so if you hear things about
[4:02:11] you and let me say this when you hear
[4:02:14] anything bad about
[4:02:16] you check are you
[4:02:20] innocent if inocent
[4:02:24] in it is inocence which gives you
[4:02:30] Faith a prophet may come and
[4:02:33] say you are not going to you are not
[4:02:35] going to reach home from
[4:02:38] here ask
[4:02:40] why as long as long as your heart is
[4:02:42] innocent
[4:02:45] as long as you know you have not done
[4:02:47] anything
[4:02:48] wrong just believe God will take you
[4:02:51] home you're going to drive you're going
[4:02:54] to b a vehicle and reach
[4:02:57] home we are not supposed to live by
[4:03:00] threat we are people who are not the
[4:03:05] same and the precious blood of Jesus
[4:03:09] Christ even this
[4:03:11] salvation the Bible says we don't have
[4:03:13] the same amount of
[4:03:17] Grace some of us have
[4:03:20] little others have much but what does
[4:03:24] that Grace do make you
[4:03:27] stand in
[4:03:29] situations where there is
[4:03:33] opposition we have been we have not been
[4:03:35] saved to
[4:03:40] sailed to fight
[4:03:44] we are going to
[4:03:45] fight the circumstances that against our
[4:03:50] salvation and the grace of God lifts
[4:03:54] us but the most important thing that we
[4:03:57] should
[4:03:59] notice that the better you will
[4:04:03] be the
[4:04:06] better will depend on how much you stay
[4:04:08] with
[4:04:11] God how much you stay near
[4:04:16] God you know some of us pray when
[4:04:18] there's a problem and we abandon
[4:04:21] him we go to church we hear the
[4:04:24] word and then go home forget about
[4:04:28] him but the more you stay with
[4:04:32] God the more let me tell you this there
[4:04:36] were
[4:04:37] Apostles there was Paul and
[4:04:40] others but Paul tells us
[4:04:44] how much he stayed with
[4:04:46] God 14
[4:04:49] years seeking reading
[4:04:53] pray and when he came back all of them
[4:04:56] had the Holy
[4:04:58] Spirit but this one who stayed longer
[4:05:01] with
[4:05:02] God he was different Elijah who stayed
[4:05:06] in the
[4:05:08] mountain most of the time with was
[4:05:10] different we hear of our prophet
[4:05:14] in this age this is a man whether he's
[4:05:17] preaching whether he's taking serious he
[4:05:20] was always with God fasting and
[4:05:25] praying and I said he stayed so much in
[4:05:28] the presence of
[4:05:30] God until it was very difficult to come
[4:05:33] out of
[4:05:35] it and I said whenever you stay the
[4:05:37] presence of
[4:05:39] God Heaven comes
[4:05:42] down a
[4:05:45] our
[4:05:46] difficulties that are that are hitting
[4:05:49] us it is because we we spend most of the
[4:05:53] time in strange
[4:05:57] atmospheres don't stay long enough with
[4:06:01] God people stay long enough with
[4:06:04] God In
[4:06:07] Prayer in reading the word Paul told
[4:06:12] Timothy be
[4:06:15] preachers who have not let us down
[4:06:19] preachers who have not let us down are
[4:06:22] the preachers who have stayed with the
[4:06:26] Bible they don't take it for
[4:06:30] granted because tomorrow is
[4:06:32] Sunday just read a scripture and goes
[4:06:35] there I'm told of a
[4:06:38] pastor when it was going come to
[4:06:41] Sunday he would stay in room of
[4:06:44] isolation the whole
[4:06:47] night praying and
[4:06:49] studying and every time we came to the P
[4:06:53] pit things
[4:06:56] worked God is Not
[4:06:59] unfair God is
[4:07:01] faithful and God is willing to work with
[4:07:04] us but how much do we stay
[4:07:09] with you could see you could see most of
[4:07:13] the time when you reach the house of
[4:07:17] brother I've been praying over this
[4:07:20] issue and when I was praying God told
[4:07:23] this God answered me this a lot of
[4:07:27] things God spoke to him and showed him
[4:07:32] directly he was a spiritual
[4:07:35] man I testify
[4:07:38] that we are told one night when Andrew
[4:07:44] met Jesus
[4:07:45] Christ and he had him for the whole
[4:07:49] night listening to him he was
[4:07:54] convinced that this is the
[4:07:56] Messiah and he left that place
[4:07:59] convinced and when he got convinced he
[4:08:02] got concerned for a
[4:08:05] brother he went looking for
[4:08:09] Peter that's why we do we fear very
[4:08:11] badly in evangelism
[4:08:14] we are not
[4:08:15] convinced that other people should hear
[4:08:18] this
[4:08:20] message we don't stay long with the Lord
[4:08:24] until we feel a
[4:08:27] DE to go out and bring
[4:08:30] somebody many of us are not sure if this
[4:08:34] message will
[4:08:37] work they are not sure that the
[4:08:40] situations in our
[4:08:42] homes can only be solved by what we have
[4:08:45] been
[4:08:46] given let me tell you brother time is
[4:08:50] coming when money is not going to solve
[4:08:53] those
[4:08:54] problems it is going to take your faith
[4:08:57] in the word and faith comes by hearing
[4:09:00] the
[4:09:01] [Music]
[4:09:03] word god should help us time is going to
[4:09:06] come when it require what you
[4:09:11] speak and you will speak what you know
[4:09:14] and speak what you
[4:09:16] are and a situation will
[4:09:19] happen time is coming and God is taking
[4:09:22] all his faithful
[4:09:24] ones praise God we must wake up we must
[4:09:28] know God is about to do
[4:09:31] something you who is still
[4:09:34] living you a
[4:09:37] Target and as a Target you're going to
[4:09:40] be either the target of the devil
[4:09:43] or the target of God you going to be a
[4:09:47] messenger one of these days the
[4:09:50] messenger of
[4:09:51] God message of sat you are going to
[4:09:55] graduate in
[4:09:57] hat or going to graduate in
[4:10:02] love brothers sisters let's rise
[4:10:12] upage that if there is a
[4:10:15] situation that you know is funny around
[4:10:18] you with a brother or a
[4:10:22] sister stand up
[4:10:24] courageously one time when I was at
[4:10:27] school and they would preach and I say
[4:10:31] who wants to come and Jesus
[4:10:33] Christ it looked so hard for me to rise
[4:10:37] up and ago one time God gave me
[4:10:42] courage they didn't look for me but I
[4:10:46] looked for
[4:10:47] them where they were my heart was so
[4:10:51] filled with a
[4:10:53] bur that I wanted to receive Christ that
[4:10:57] day and when I received that I was not
[4:11:02] ashamed I went to the people were doing
[4:11:04] fishal things with and I told them I'm a
[4:11:09] Christian God gave me Grace to Have
[4:11:12] Courage
[4:11:14] and be witness that I'm a
[4:11:17] Christian when I fall I must have
[4:11:21] courage had somebody I must have courage
[4:11:25] and go to that person and I say I'm
[4:11:28] sorry I've done something wrong God
[4:11:32] should help us
[4:11:33] ministers that we be the first people to
[4:11:36] do
[4:11:39] that we shall clean our congregations
[4:11:45] our congregations are
[4:11:47] suffering diseases which are not
[4:11:51] their God should help us stay longer
[4:11:56] with
[4:11:58] God when Paul stayed long with
[4:12:02] God when he could go to a
[4:12:05] congregation despite the
[4:12:07] opposition he went to one place it took
[4:12:11] there two months
[4:12:14] preaching to those people when there was
[4:12:17] opposition they pulled out the
[4:12:20] Believers took them to a certain
[4:12:23] Hall preach to them five hours a
[4:12:27] day preaching to them every
[4:12:30] day for two
[4:12:33] years you tell me such a person when
[4:12:36] he's
[4:12:38] left can you doubt him no wonder
[4:12:43] soever he would
[4:12:45] live when he has had many that he has
[4:12:48] that I
[4:12:50] believe now what was
[4:12:53] happening these people who were
[4:12:56] believing they would take the gospel
[4:12:58] out and go and tell other people and
[4:13:02] other people would also
[4:13:03] come he preaches they go
[4:13:06] out God should help us people are
[4:13:10] thinking the work of witnessing
[4:13:13] is the work of fivefold
[4:13:16] ministry that's a work of
[4:13:20] Believers all believers whether you a
[4:13:24] housewife whether you are a cook
[4:13:26] somewhere whether you are a pter
[4:13:28] somewhere you are
[4:13:30] witness but the problem is our members
[4:13:34] are not
[4:13:35] convinced why
[4:13:37] theyed why are they not
[4:13:40] convinced some of us ministers we are
[4:13:43] not
[4:13:44] convinced I know you are not here who
[4:13:46] are like
[4:13:47] [Music]
[4:13:51] that that kind that kind of ministers
[4:13:54] are not
[4:13:55] here so don't have a problem that's the
[4:13:58] situation isn't it when the minister is
[4:14:03] convinced and the church is
[4:14:05] convinced the community will be
[4:14:08] convinced you cannot reach a community
[4:14:12] where there is a message chur and people
[4:14:14] don't know the
[4:14:16] difference what we
[4:14:19] believe people can choose and
[4:14:22] choose they reach a time they Qui and
[4:14:27] they say surely what they have we don't
[4:14:30] have
[4:14:31] [Music]
[4:14:32] it we need to stayer with
[4:14:38] God don't just make a visitation and go

[4:15:13] meet
[4:15:14] God God is hidden
[4:15:17] hidden
[4:15:19] inity and we must seek
[4:15:23] Him of
[4:15:25] Lord
[4:15:27] two God gives Grace to those who are
[4:15:33] humble and he resists the
[4:15:40] proud you know the talents we have

[4:16:21] man

[4:16:26] humility youed the highest
[4:16:30] thing some gave them up some gave them
[4:16:34] up and started dressing like
[4:16:38] Christians they were
[4:16:40] abused but God gave them Grace to
[4:16:43] continue

[4:17:25] sermon you hear the
[4:17:28] opposite and you go home and wonder what
[4:17:31] wrong have I done I think I should not

[4:17:38] to go back and you're going to preach
[4:17:40] like nothing happened
[4:17:43] God gives you
[4:17:45] Grace don't think that you are so
[4:17:48] impossible don't think that you are
[4:17:51] great because you you
[4:17:53] insist you are
[4:17:56] resilient on what God has is wanting to
[4:17:59] be
[4:18:00] done by taking What God
[4:18:02] Says is more important there are many
[4:18:06] people they have heard this message but
[4:18:09] they don't want to believe it they said
[4:18:13] certain lady who said we went to college
[4:18:17] and while we were there they told us do
[4:18:20] you
[4:18:21] know those people are right but their
[4:18:24] gospel is hard to
[4:18:28] believe a very hard
[4:18:31] gospel but why do you believe it God
[4:18:35] Gave You
[4:18:37] Grace every step of God justification
[4:18:42] the baptism of the Holy Spirit to the
[4:18:46] maturity every step you take it
[4:18:51] courageous take it by force and every
[4:18:55] time you
[4:18:56] willing God gives you
[4:18:59] Grace if things look hard and you
[4:19:03] insist that I will
[4:19:05] cross God will give
[4:19:09] you you will
[4:19:11] cross so having stayed longer with
[4:19:14] God you receive the grace of God to do
[4:19:18] things which are a bit different from
[4:19:21] others let me tell you God making you a
[4:19:25] child is not a
[4:19:28] gift it is a
[4:19:31] bath it's not a gift oh give me a gift
[4:19:35] that I may be your son
[4:19:38] no it's a birth and none of you chose to
[4:19:42] Bear the children you
[4:19:45] have just came and we also came and let
[4:19:50] me tell you whatever God saw us
[4:19:53] be we are going to be it doesn't matter
[4:19:57] the
[4:19:58] obstacles you can look at me or I can
[4:20:02] look at you as a dangerous person is not
[4:20:06] going to
[4:20:06] cross but God understands better he
[4:20:10] knows who here is going to cross
[4:20:17] over yes it is God who
[4:20:22] knows he knows how and therefore gives
[4:20:26] us the grace how to do
[4:20:29] it he's the one who has a volume of
[4:20:36] book where it is written about
[4:20:39] you the point is are you con
[4:20:44] what you believe don't look at
[4:20:46] people look at your
[4:20:49] conviction right yes I nor say if the
[4:20:54] Bible tells me it is good to
[4:20:58] backl I backslide on the principle of
[4:21:02] the
[4:21:04] Bible I don't want to backslide because
[4:21:07] of friends of because because of women
[4:21:12] because of I want to back a
[4:21:14] SL because the Bible
[4:21:16] St but so far I've not find it that's
[4:21:21] why I'm still
[4:21:22] standing I believe that's why you also
[4:21:28] still because God holds
[4:21:32] it now that friend who is in the
[4:21:36] denominations and he a child of God and
[4:21:39] he's a
[4:21:40] drunker don't mind he will come just
[4:21:44] keep talking to
[4:21:46] him don't despise him don't criticize
[4:21:50] him oh praise God I'm also
[4:21:55] begging me let me go to my last
[4:21:58] Point may God bless you so much amen so
[4:22:04] the Bible says God gives
[4:22:08] grace to the
[4:22:10] humble Joseph
[4:22:14] took him to
[4:22:15] prison and God gave him Grace to
[4:22:19] overcome the
[4:22:20] prison and become auty
[4:22:24] Pharaoh God gave gave Daniel
[4:22:28] Grace when when the decree went
[4:22:32] forth that's when when he did what
[4:22:35] politics didn't
[4:22:38] want the squeeze is coming
[4:22:42] if these simple things are defeating
[4:22:45] us a little talks about
[4:22:48] us they don't

[4:23:54] statement from my pastor I clearly
[4:23:59] failed I could not go back to church I
[4:24:03] stayed away from church I said let him
[4:24:06] stay with this
[4:24:07] church I fail with the
[4:24:10] paper now why should I think about it I
[4:24:14] should work harder I should do better
[4:24:18] brothers and sisters let us not say
[4:24:22] let's bear with each other because we
[4:24:23] are
[4:24:26] human yeah you would bear with me
[4:24:28] because I'm
[4:24:29] human but I'm failing
[4:24:32] Pur at the end of the day it is me who
[4:24:36] is not going to
[4:24:38] graduate for you who are saying you are
[4:24:40] a good brother
[4:24:42] you graduate because you are doing your
[4:24:45] part you are passing but I'm the one who
[4:24:48] is hiding behind this you know
[4:24:52] some we want to worship very funny
[4:24:56] things somebody has talked about me
[4:25:00] somebody hat me and then I'm explaining
[4:25:03] to to brother Peter
[4:25:06] here is not getting it very
[4:25:09] well but the Bible says forgive
[4:25:12] brother Peter you have not understood
[4:25:14] very
[4:25:16] well let me tell you how it
[4:25:20] happened what do you want to raise the
[4:25:25] spirit to hold on it and I fall but the
[4:25:30] brother is say no no no
[4:25:32] no the Bible says like
[4:25:34] this we must continue seeking for the
[4:25:38] grace of God
[4:25:43] comes when you are
[4:25:45] humble amen and
[4:25:48] gra brings
[4:25:52] righteousness Grace brings
[4:25:55] righteousness Grace puts things that you
[4:25:59] could not do
[4:26:00] yourself stands for you could not do
[4:26:04] yourself
[4:26:06] blessed then
[4:26:08] finally I want to say this the
[4:26:12] says many are the afflictions of the
[4:26:19] righte not church members I hope you
[4:26:22] hearing very well afflictions are not
[4:26:24] for church
[4:26:27] members no no no
[4:26:30] no afflictions are not for poor
[4:26:34] people many afflictions of the poor
[4:26:38] no they don't even say many are the
[4:26:41] afflictions of sinners
[4:26:45] no no it is for
[4:26:48] Who righte and the Lord
[4:26:52] delivers from all
[4:26:56] of so I'm saying if you have so many
[4:27:02] trials then you're
[4:27:06] rightous because God trusts you he knows
[4:27:12] every challenge you're going to go
[4:27:14] through
[4:27:15] it what am I talking about when right
[4:27:19] when When Trials come they must find you
[4:27:23] when you have a good
[4:27:25] heart you must be a believer in order to
[4:27:29] go through it we are talking of
[4:27:31] passing passing the test every test
[4:27:35] which comes you pass it according to the
[4:27:39] condition of your heart
[4:27:45] amen amen that's why in the House of
[4:27:50] David there every
[4:27:54] day even when he was Tried by
[4:27:58] sa he was staying in the
[4:28:02] bush for many years in the bush they had
[4:28:07] reason to
[4:28:10] kill they reason but he never did that
[4:28:15] he had reason to talk bad about
[4:28:19] sa not to
[4:28:23] greet had reason because things were
[4:28:27] clear other day he escaped the killing
[4:28:30] other day he escaped the other the other
[4:28:33] day they told
[4:28:34] him they had reason but he had a good
[4:28:39] heart a good attitude
[4:28:42] to as God is
[4:28:47] Anointed we have been anointed by the
[4:28:49] same
[4:28:52] Prophet we should respect the
[4:28:58] anointing we believe the
[4:29:01] message we baptized the we baptized
[4:29:04] because of the
[4:29:07] message we are behav we are we behave
[4:29:13] because of that
[4:29:16] message why should we not respect each
[4:29:20] other's
[4:29:25] anointing do you believe that the
[4:29:28] anointing
[4:29:31] from do you believe God spoke to
[4:29:34] him is it God who said I have a
[4:29:39] message to give you for this generation
[4:29:43] do you believe he received
[4:29:45] it do you believe he left it with
[4:29:50] us therefore the trouble is our
[4:29:55] attitudes the trouble is our
[4:29:57] hearts there's no problem with the
[4:30:01] message
[4:30:02] no no the problem is
[4:30:07] mine so that's why we go back to the
[4:30:10] same principle
[4:30:13] If the message
[4:30:14] says that when you have Hur me I don't
[4:30:16] greet
[4:30:18] you I not
[4:30:23] you the Bible says when we have
[4:30:27] disagreed I should not pray for you or
[4:30:30] call you
[4:30:32] brother if it is there I do that but if
[4:30:36] it is not there you have reason to ask
[4:30:39] me what's wrong with you
[4:30:42] because I would have every
[4:30:45] wrong how can I say this the message I
[4:30:49] believe and I behave contr and I am not
[4:30:55] mad takes a mad
[4:30:58] person you're hearing the right thing
[4:31:01] and you're doing the wrong thing the
[4:31:04] prophet found one
[4:31:06] man he was eating food the food he was
[4:31:09] also eating in the
[4:31:12] and I said he
[4:31:14] said he said told him
[4:31:18] why how can you take this good
[4:31:22] food and put in that bad
[4:31:26] mouth mouth which speaks bad
[4:31:30] things the man was just ashamed he never
[4:31:33] spoke
[4:31:35] again how can we take this
[4:31:40] message and put in our
[4:31:42] hearts and we behave
[4:31:46] [Music]
[4:31:48] different God should help us how can
[4:31:53] unbelievers hear us
[4:31:55] preach their preaching is okay but their
[4:31:59] life is
[4:32:02] not we are mad pastors forgive me but
[4:32:07] I'm saying there's something inane
[4:32:13] that has happened to
[4:32:18] us when we come to the
[4:32:24] funeral
[4:32:31] we there's one brother who was preaching
[4:32:34] a
[4:32:35] sermon and he said I'm preaching this
[4:32:39] sermon because most of the time
[4:32:43] when we at the bar
[4:32:44] ceremony we say our sister is going to
[4:32:47] to be with the
[4:32:49] Lord our brother has G to be with the
[4:32:52] Lord but we have seen the
[4:32:58] record record we have seen on
[4:33:03] Earth how is he
[4:33:05] going how is she going let's take this
[4:33:09] very serious
[4:33:11] every time we see
[4:33:14] death let us know what caused
[4:33:17] it it was
[4:33:20] sin let this be the
[4:33:24] time activities of
[4:33:28] sin whenever we see
[4:33:32] death God should help us I don't want to
[4:33:36] take you
[4:33:37] far but I want to finish with
[4:33:40] this the Bible say says in numbers 9 19
[4:33:45] verse
[4:33:47] 9
[4:33:49] when
[4:33:52] 199
[4:33:53] says that
[4:33:56] Ash of the the red
[4:34:02] H you take it and keep it to a clean
[4:34:08] place and must be handled
[4:34:12] by Lite who is
[4:34:15] clean because it is the Waters of
[4:34:19] Separation it separates us from
[4:34:24] sin sister
[4:34:26] brother P in the
[4:34:29] pit with the word of God is the one who
[4:34:33] separates
[4:34:35] you from the
[4:34:38] sin how for me when I pray that's when I
[4:34:41] know I pray to my God I know my I am
[4:34:45] repeating the word preached in the
[4:34:48] pp by your pastor and you believe it it
[4:34:53] is what separates you
[4:34:56] from it's the Waters of
[4:34:59] Separation if you leave it there your
[4:35:02] sin will
[4:35:04] remain
[4:35:06] but when will it not
[4:35:09] work when it is kept the wrong
[4:35:14] place it cannot
[4:35:17] work even if the Bible is the
[4:35:21] truth put it in a Catholic
[4:35:24] Church it doesn't continue being
[4:35:30] good because the system
[4:35:33] there will di it not to say what it is
[4:35:38] saying you take it to a denomination
[4:35:42] it will not do what it is supposed to
[4:35:45] do it must be the clean place that's why
[4:35:49] the Bible says come out
[4:35:53] of my
[4:35:55] people and come to where I serve this
[4:35:58] meal in a good
[4:36:01] place it must be a clean
[4:36:04] place it must be a word place it's not a
[4:36:08] a place of fings
[4:36:12] fightings Whenever there are fightings
[4:36:14] in the
[4:36:16] church the word sees working it is what
[4:36:19] it is supposed to
[4:36:21] work so let's keep our churches
[4:36:25] clean come with your in the
[4:36:29] church if you have it then come
[4:36:33] consciously and say
[4:36:35] God I come the where I am
[4:36:39] dirty I'm now on the altar
[4:36:42] Speak Lord and clean me I don't want to
[4:36:46] be a Repro to
[4:36:50] this the message God gave
[4:36:53] Moses kept the
[4:36:56] Israelites above any other
[4:36:59] Nation there was no B they would
[4:37:02] lose there was no hunger which would
[4:37:05] come be
[4:37:08] no because of the word
[4:37:12] in a clean
[4:37:15] place let our hearts be clean
[4:37:19] Also let's
[4:37:21] remove those bad
[4:37:24] feelings and then we shall have effect
[4:37:26] on the
[4:37:29] people if I'm
[4:37:31] rude and I preach
[4:37:34] rudness my church
[4:37:39] Ro if I'm immoral
[4:37:43] and I preach in my
[4:37:45] church the church will
[4:37:48] become Church become
[4:37:51] immoral the church will become what it
[4:37:55] is when you take the right
[4:37:58] word in the right place and operating in
[4:38:02] the right
[4:38:04] heart then we shall see things
[4:38:07] happen don't ask we keep asking our
[4:38:10] where are the Miracles
[4:38:12] that's why they are not
[4:38:14] there the message is right but they hold
[4:38:27] us we are the ones keeping away the the
[4:38:30] signs and
[4:38:34] wonders that's why you see Believers in
[4:38:36] the
[4:38:37] church they hide and go to doctors in
[4:38:40] the night
[4:38:44] because there's no
[4:38:46] Victory Church must have
[4:38:49] Victory every day God bless you so
