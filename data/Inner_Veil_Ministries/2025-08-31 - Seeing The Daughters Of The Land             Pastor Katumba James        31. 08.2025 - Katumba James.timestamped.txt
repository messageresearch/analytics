[45:14] that you know we continue taking
[45:15] opportunity all the time
[45:20] when the church doors are open.
[45:23] Praise the name of God. So brother
[45:26] Wilfred is not around.
[45:28] He was admitted in hospital last
[45:30] evening.
[45:32] He was vomiting blood.
[45:35] But I called the wife this morning
[45:38] said that when he was not only vomited
[45:40] once
[45:44] but doing better this morning.
[45:48] So we just keep on praying for them
[45:51] as well as extending our hand of
[45:54] support.
[45:56] Praise the name of the Lord.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Our pastor is not around today.
[46:01] He went to Mayuk
[46:03] &gt;&gt; where he took brother Franklin.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; You'll be preaching in the whole day.
[46:10] Then tomorrow morning.
[46:12] They all traveling to Calvary.
[46:16] So just keep him in your prayers. They
[46:18] going to have a whole week meetings in
[46:23] just keep them in our prayers.
[46:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Do
[46:27] &gt;&gt; we have any person coming here for the
[46:29] first time?
[46:31] Please raise up your hands.
[46:35] You're welcome.
[46:39] Praise the name of our Lord. So today we
[46:41] are going to have an afternoon service
[46:45] for all the youth,
[46:48] those in school,
[46:50] those out of school and even those who
[46:53] are married.
[46:55] But they they are youth.
[46:58] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[47:00] now starting from September,
[47:06] we are going to separate these two.
[47:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Now I've
[47:12] been receiving quite a number of
[47:13] concerns
[47:16] saying that you know how can you share
[47:18] things of married people as youth?
[47:26] with these in school.
[47:31] Praise the name of our Lord. So we are
[47:33] going to separate that.
[47:36] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[47:38] I'm thinking
[47:40] in the middle of the month
[47:43] we meet the youth in school.
[47:47] That's the second service which will be
[47:48] in the afternoon.
[47:51] And then we can talk about school
[47:52] things.
[47:54] Praise the name of our Lord. Breathing
[47:57] hard at school,
[47:59] you know, being parents,
[48:03] doing housework at home,
[48:06] all that may be necessary.
[48:08] And then at the end of the month, we
[48:11] meet those who have finished school
[48:15] and those who have just married.
[48:19] And then we talk about
[48:21] How can I get into marriage?
[48:24] And then if I'm married, how can I keep
[48:27] my love burning?
[48:30] Praise the name of Lord. And then we
[48:32] talk on that kind of level.
[48:36] Praise the name of Allah. But we are
[48:38] meeting all
[48:40] but coming month
[48:43] we shall do the separation of the
[48:44] classes
[48:47] that the lord can guide us how we can be
[48:50] able to be of help to one another
[48:53] praise the name of our lord I don't know
[48:55] if there is a song today
[48:59] there is nothing
[49:03] praise the name of our lord so I think
[49:05] we can proceed
[49:08] Praise the name of our Lord. I request
[49:10] that we stand up
[49:13] and then go to our Bibles.
[49:19] Before we read it, let's pray again.
[49:22] Father, we thank you for this morning.
[49:25] We give praise and honor to your name.
[49:28] now commit the reading of the word into
[49:30] your hands,
[49:32] praying that you may reveal yourself to
[49:34] us
[49:35] and show us the path that we have to
[49:37] take.
[49:38] Bless us in such a special father.
[49:42] In the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray
[49:43] and ask this.
[49:45] Amen. Amen. Perhaps I'd forgotten to
[49:48] make this.
[49:50] Next Sunday
[49:52] will be the first Sunday of the month.
[49:56] So we shall have the Lord's supper
[50:00] that is on 7th
[50:03] 7th of September.
[50:06] We shall have the Lord's supper.
[50:10] So that's next Sunday. So come prepared
[50:13] for two services
[50:15] and then the Lord's supper.
[50:17] I don't know what the Lord will put on
[50:19] my heart preach
[50:21] but I felt maybe coming down to preach
[50:24] about
[50:28] The why we all need to observe the
[50:30] Lord's supper.
[50:33] All of us
[50:36] when Peter was telling Jesus not me.
[50:42] Jesus said then if I don't worship
[50:45] you are not part of me.
[50:48] So we need to see that we partake of the
[50:50] Lord's supper
[50:54] as long as we have come for fellowship.
[50:58] If there is anything that hinders you,
[51:01] make it right before you come.
[51:05] Praise the name of our Lord. Make it
[51:06] right before you come.
[51:09] You know, people were not counted
[51:10] serious.
[51:13] Don't partake of the Lord.
[51:16] A widow was not counted worth to be held
[51:20] if she didn't wash other disciples feet.
[51:26] In the Exodus, whoever never took of the
[51:29] Lord's Passover
[51:33] was cut off. So why would you cut off
[51:36] yourself?
[51:38] Praise the name of our Lord. So let us
[51:41] go to our scripture reading
[51:44] in Genesis chapter 34
[51:48] and then verse one to verse 7.
[51:52] The Bible says
[51:55] and dinner the daughter of Leia which
[51:57] she bare unto Jacob went out to see the
[52:00] daughters of the land.
[52:04] [Music]
[52:09] And when Sheckchham the son of Hammed
[52:11] the Heivite, prince of the country, saw
[52:14] her, he took her and lay with her and
[52:17] defiled her.
[52:30] [Music]
[52:33] And she sp and Sheckchham spoke unto his
[52:36] father Hama saying, "Get me this damn
[52:40] cell to wife.
[52:58] Verse four.
[53:03] [Music]
[53:06] And Jacob heard that he had defiled
[53:08] dinner his daughter. Now his sons were
[53:10] with his cattle in the field. And Jacob
[53:14] held his peace until they were come.
[53:29] Navana
[53:31] bar
[53:41] and Hmed the father of Sheckchim went
[53:43] unto Jacob to commune with him.
[53:53] And the sons of Jacob came out of the
[53:56] field when they heard it. And the men
[53:58] were agrieved, and they were very wroth
[54:01] because he had wrought fully in Israel
[54:04] in lying with Jacob's daughter, which
[54:07] thing ought not to be done.
[54:29] the blessing of his word.
[54:34] So my subject,
[54:37] praise the name of our Lord.
[54:40] I got this title several month ago.
[54:47] But he was waiting for the right time
[54:51] and I felt it was good to preach it in
[54:53] the holidays.
[54:56] I thought it was good to preach it in
[54:57] the holidays.
[55:00] So in verse one
[55:03] that's why we are taking our title
[55:07] seeing the daughters of the land.
[55:12] So our title is seeing the daughters of
[55:14] the land.
[55:25] How do they behave?
[55:27] How do they wear? How do they eat? What
[55:31] do they do? That was the problem of
[55:33] dinner.
[55:36] They were actually on their journey,
[55:40] you know, from where Jacob's
[55:42] father-in-law was
[55:46] and then they were going to the land of
[55:48] Canaan
[55:50] and then they reach a place
[55:54] which is called actually shaken
[55:58] and so when they were in this place
[56:02] so you find that dinner
[56:04] &gt;&gt; was the only daughter of Jacob.
[56:09] I believe she was so much love.
[56:12] You know, like when you are maybe the
[56:14] only daughter or the only son at home,
[56:20] you know, everybody's attention is on
[56:22] you.
[56:24] You are very precious.
[56:26] You know, until even some things they
[56:28] exclude you from doing them.
[56:32] They were esteemed higher than us.
[56:36] And this was dinner.
[56:39] And then his brother, our brothers would
[56:42] go down to take care of the animals.
[56:46] Maybe spend their two days for the whole
[56:49] week because you know pastor,
[56:53] you know, they keep on moving from one
[56:54] place to another
[56:57] looking for pasture. It's like if you
[57:00] follow that story, if you go backwards,
[57:04] you know, you'll find that you know like
[57:07] Joseph,
[57:09] he was sent by his father to his
[57:11] brethren
[57:14] to find how they doing coming with some
[57:17] things for them
[57:19] and then he reached a certain place and
[57:21] then he was asking those people have you
[57:24] seen the sons of Jacob
[57:26] and the person told him I heard them
[57:29] saying that they are going to a certain
[57:30] place
[57:32] because there was pasture and water. So
[57:35] then he continues walking
[57:38] long distances
[57:40] until when he met them. So now dinner
[57:43] here
[57:45] maybe her association was more with the
[57:47] parents. Now
[57:51] she has come to a land.
[57:54] There is a city around
[57:57] let me go and find out.
[58:00] The Bible says she went out
[58:04] to see the daughters of the land.
[58:09] She left her protection
[58:12] and then she went to the people of this
[58:15] the land.
[58:17] how they were behaving,
[58:20] how they were conducting themselves,
[58:23] how they were dressing themselves,
[58:25] you know, and then these things
[58:27] influenced her.
[58:30] But now the Bible says if she went to
[58:33] the to see the daughters of the lamb
[58:36] and you know the daughters of the land
[58:40] people who don't fear God
[58:44] people who behave any way they want to
[58:46] behave.
[58:48] People who speak anything they want to
[58:50] speak.
[58:52] People who do anything that they want to
[58:54] do.
[58:55] We are also living in the world and we
[58:59] live amongst the daughters of God.
[59:03] We live amongst them.
[59:06] Either they are our neighbors,
[59:09] either they are our colleagues at place
[59:11] of work,
[59:13] either we study with them at school,
[59:16] daughters of the land, but they don't
[59:18] have the same value.
[59:23] They don't have the same character.
[59:26] They don't have the same fear.
[59:29] They don't have the same aspiration
[59:33] that we have as children of the kingdom
[59:36] of God.
[59:38] Praise the name of our Lord. They have
[59:40] their cultures that they follow.
[59:43] They have their lifestyles that they
[59:45] follow.
[59:47] They have their fashions that they
[59:48] follow.
[59:50] They have their things that they call
[59:52] dear.
[59:54] They have people they look to
[59:58] maybe superstars,
[1:00:00] oh great influences,
[1:00:03] models,
[1:00:05] you know, all you know kind of different
[1:00:07] people
[1:00:09] and they draw their influence from
[1:00:12] the daughters of the land. We live
[1:00:15] amongst them. We work with them. We stud
[1:00:19] with them. We we are neighborhood to
[1:00:22] them.
[1:00:24] So now the danger that Dina did
[1:00:28] is she went out
[1:00:31] and then she absorbed the wrong
[1:00:34] influences.
[1:00:37] She looked unto the people of the land
[1:00:41] and then her mind was taken by what they
[1:00:44] do,
[1:00:46] how they behave themselves,
[1:00:49] how they handle their lifestyle.
[1:00:52] The daughters of the land, they don't
[1:00:55] care when they cut off their hair.
[1:00:58] When the Bible says it's not good for a
[1:01:01] woman to cut off her hair,
[1:01:04] they wear pants.
[1:01:07] You know when the Bible says it's an
[1:01:08] abomination for women to put on things
[1:01:10] that pertain to a man,
[1:01:15] they tattoo their bodies.
[1:01:19] You know all these things the Bible says
[1:01:21] they are wrong.
[1:01:24] They paint themselves.
[1:01:27] Praise the name of the Lord. Then you
[1:01:29] see sometimes you find green lips.
[1:01:34] Then you say it lives on the lips or
[1:01:35] what?
[1:01:38] Then sometimes red lips.
[1:01:41] Then you start wondering have they been
[1:01:43] leaking blood or what?
[1:01:47] Then black lips.
[1:01:50] Have they been licking charcoal or what?
[1:01:54] Then yellow lips.
[1:01:58] And then you start wondering
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; then some eyelids.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; And then you get different colors.
[1:02:09] Some of them you get them painted like a
[1:02:11] cats.
[1:02:14] I start wondering what is this?
[1:02:17] And then others go to the hair and then
[1:02:20] they have different colors in the hair
[1:02:24] rainbow colors.
[1:02:27] Not natural at all.
[1:02:32] You know those days people had gray hair
[1:02:38] [Music]
[1:02:39] they would put I think is it can't or
[1:02:42] die? They just put something to make
[1:02:43] them die.
[1:02:47] But these days they make their hair
[1:02:49] white
[1:02:53] hair.
[1:02:57] I start wondering what's happening.
[1:03:00] The daughters of the land.
[1:03:02] So now saw the daughters of the land
[1:03:07] and they had no values.
[1:03:10] A society which doesn't have things they
[1:03:12] take as godly.
[1:03:16] And these are the communities that we
[1:03:18] live in.
[1:03:20] Maybe you are renting here.
[1:03:22] This where your home is
[1:03:25] and the next place is a lo
[1:03:32] and every evil thing just happens around
[1:03:35] you.
[1:03:38] Now
[1:03:40] God has given us the Holy Spirit
[1:03:44] to be in position
[1:03:46] to overcome all these negative
[1:03:49] influences.
[1:03:51] That's why it is important for each and
[1:03:53] every one of us
[1:03:55] to receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:57] Spirit
[1:03:59] because when the spirit of God is in
[1:04:01] you,
[1:04:03] the spirit of God will give you ability
[1:04:08] to overcome all negative influences.
[1:04:13] Praise the name of our Lord. Wherever
[1:04:15] they may be, whatever it may be, you
[1:04:19] have the Holy Spirit
[1:04:21] in position to overcome all those
[1:04:23] things.
[1:04:25] Praise the name of our Lord. So now when
[1:04:27] dinner went to this place,
[1:04:30] the Bible says and she who was the
[1:04:34] prince
[1:04:36] you know the son of Hammer
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; the heite
[1:04:43] the prince of the country
[1:04:46] saw her.
[1:04:50] And when he saw her
[1:04:53] because they they had they have no
[1:04:55] values
[1:04:57] and now as a prince
[1:05:00] of that country
[1:05:02] any woman you see you just take.
[1:05:06] So when he saw dinner
[1:05:09] the Bible says he took her
[1:05:13] and lay with her and defiled her.
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:22] defiled her or we can say raped her.
[1:05:31] And this is what happens when you go out
[1:05:33] to see the daughters of the land
[1:05:38] to the daughters of the land. The rich
[1:05:41] man to come and say, "I love you.
[1:05:48] This rich man loves me.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; She doesn't care anything. She just
[1:05:51] goes.
[1:05:54] That was the same thing here.
[1:05:57] The daughters of the land were telling
[1:06:00] dinner. Ah, now you're going to become
[1:06:02] the queen.
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:08] If it was me,
[1:06:12] an opportunity of God,
[1:06:14] daughters of the land,
[1:06:16] And so the daughters of land can start
[1:06:18] teaching you
[1:06:21] their manners of life.
[1:06:26] Don't you see that you look beautiful?
[1:06:29] This dress brings you out well.
[1:06:32] The figure comes out well. They teaching
[1:06:34] you their ways of
[1:06:39] he also behave like
[1:06:42] you come and we go the other side.
[1:06:45] Daughters of the land, they influence
[1:06:48] you because that's part of them.
[1:06:55] I'm tired of you with your dresses.
[1:06:59] You don't want to wear some trous and
[1:07:01] you look well.
[1:07:03] You don't want to be
[1:07:06] daughters of the land drawing you to the
[1:07:10] things that they do. That's why I was
[1:07:13] being subjected
[1:07:16] now to shake him say this an opportunity
[1:07:21] and these are the people who came with
[1:07:23] Jacob.
[1:07:25] Ah, this one I believe is good.
[1:07:28] And now the struggle we have today.
[1:07:32] Elderly men,
[1:07:35] they want young girls.
[1:07:40] You know those young ones are not sick.
[1:07:42] Now they come and give you maybe a
[1:07:44] million shillings.
[1:07:48] I have never even received a million.
[1:07:52] And these young girls or young women,
[1:07:57] they are not afraid of any disease.
[1:08:01] What they afraid of is pregnancy.
[1:08:05] Because pregnancy, everybody will know
[1:08:07] what happened.
[1:08:14] And then now we have scenarios
[1:08:18] even in churches.
[1:08:21] Sir,
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; a sister is not married,
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; but she's on family planning
[1:08:28] planning for what?
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You don't have a husband.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And then you go into family planning
[1:08:36] planning.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong there.
[1:08:39] Daughters of the land.
[1:08:42] And some of them when they marry
[1:08:45] they want to give excuses
[1:08:51] let us not produce children
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; but covering up some family planning
[1:08:54] things
[1:08:58] and then you get troubles
[1:09:02] you know they they are just used to the
[1:09:04] way of the daughters of the lamb
[1:09:08] now to shake him like the men of the
[1:09:12] world.
[1:09:16] How would you take a wife whom you have
[1:09:18] never
[1:09:20] going to her?
[1:09:22] You don't know her.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; That was shaken.
[1:09:27] He got her,
[1:09:29] lay with her, smiled with her. Then the
[1:09:32] things you should have done first.
[1:09:35] Now he starts trying to work.
[1:09:38] And then there are people doing the same
[1:09:39] thing.
[1:09:41] They not married but they living with
[1:09:44] one another
[1:09:46] and then now they come to try to cover
[1:09:48] up.
[1:09:53] Now what are we going to do?
[1:09:56] Shake him. So the Bible says he took her
[1:10:01] and with her
[1:10:04] with her. Then verse three says and he
[1:10:07] sle to dinner.
[1:10:13] the daughter of Jacob and he loved the
[1:10:16] dam
[1:10:18] kindly unto the dam.
[1:10:22] I want her to be my wife.
[1:10:24] The things he should have done first,
[1:10:29] he's doing them last.
[1:10:32] We get many young people trapped in this
[1:10:35] kind of
[1:10:38] when they at maybe university
[1:10:42] you know there is a lot of pressure
[1:10:46] like I remember when I was also still
[1:10:48] there
[1:10:49] and then you know colleagues would come
[1:10:51] and say
[1:10:53] you know you don't leave the university
[1:10:54] before you get somebody you're going to
[1:10:56] marry.
[1:11:00] So they were trying to pair up, pair up,
[1:11:02] but
[1:11:04] it's a mindset that people have got.
[1:11:08] I think this one can be, this one can
[1:11:10] be, this one can be. But that's not the
[1:11:13] way they do things.
[1:11:16] Praise the name of the Lord. But this is
[1:11:18] the mind that has taken people.
[1:11:22] And then somebody will say, but how do
[1:11:24] you just get to yourself to that person?
[1:11:28] Have you ever slept with them?
[1:11:30] No, you are foolish.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Shake them.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And that's the mind of the world.
[1:11:40] People don't care what they do.
[1:11:44] Like you go most of these places,
[1:11:47] youth centers.
[1:11:50] I don't know where the youth center of
[1:11:52] Ginger is, but we have youth center here
[1:11:54] and other places.
[1:11:57] Then there you will find youth centers.
[1:12:01] There is always a family planning unit
[1:12:04] there.
[1:12:08] Now family for a youth,
[1:12:12] not married, then you know where they
[1:12:15] are going.
[1:12:17] Pills,
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; condoms,
[1:12:22] condoms.
[1:12:26] And he said please walk with them
[1:12:29] have them. We have this injectable
[1:12:34] this one here. Somebody is a youth
[1:12:38] not married and he knows all those kind
[1:12:42] of world
[1:12:46] daughters of the land. That's how they
[1:12:49] do. That's how they behave. And now they
[1:12:54] bring it to you.
[1:12:56] It's a good plan.
[1:12:59] Fornicating
[1:13:02] is not a problem.
[1:13:08] You know, they they try to say that but
[1:13:12] I I'll handle if that one is not a
[1:13:14] problem.
[1:13:16] Daughters of the land. But now the Bible
[1:13:20] says he did fall in Israel.
[1:13:29] And the Bible says he did things that he
[1:13:32] should not.
[1:13:36] And you can't if you sleep with a man
[1:13:40] or a boy or a girl, a woman that is not
[1:13:45] your wife,
[1:13:47] you are not married to him,
[1:13:50] is wickedness before God.
[1:13:56] Praise the name of our Lord. But you
[1:13:58] see, we have exposed ourselves
[1:14:02] to so many things of the world
[1:14:06] until the pressure to fornicate.
[1:14:13] You get young men
[1:14:16] all the time. They want to look at naked
[1:14:19] women.
[1:14:22] You get that
[1:14:24] spirits of the world.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; And maybe sometimes
[1:14:30] they either go to a place where they can
[1:14:32] go and have that to them.
[1:14:40] And now we have phones.
[1:14:44] Everything that is on the phone.
[1:14:47] And so your child, maybe your son,
[1:14:51] or your daughter, they are hiding
[1:14:53] somewhere,
[1:14:55] maybe in their bedroom or in their free
[1:14:58] time somewhere.
[1:15:00] All the time consuming that things
[1:15:05] all the time consuming that thing.
[1:15:09] They even know where to buy them from.
[1:15:12] They know very smart.
[1:15:15] The world has so much gone to influence
[1:15:18] them.
[1:15:20] You know that they can know every
[1:15:23] detail.
[1:15:25] They start wondering
[1:15:29] seeing the daughters of the land
[1:15:32] because they don't have any values.
[1:15:35] So then they used to this kind of things
[1:15:38] and then for you when you amongst them
[1:15:41] they will start a vulgar talk
[1:15:46] like boys or young men.
[1:15:49] talk about women.
[1:15:51] Then you go to girls or women,
[1:15:54] talk about men,
[1:15:56] this gossip, the other gossip,
[1:16:00] gossip, she has got this person.
[1:16:04] But if me had that one, I think I'll be
[1:16:07] well. How about your
[1:16:10] other one? No.
[1:16:12] You know that kind of gossip.
[1:16:17] And then some of them have not only one
[1:16:19] but three, four.
[1:16:24] Like the things we read in newspapers,
[1:16:27] university students
[1:16:29] getting marks
[1:16:34] just because they sleep with their
[1:16:35] lecturers
[1:16:38] and they get marks and they pass.
[1:16:41] Then others maintaining their jobs
[1:16:47] because they have slept with a boss.
[1:16:53] Those kind of things very rampant.
[1:16:57] Very common.
[1:16:59] That's the world we are living in.
[1:17:01] That's why you need to see the to get
[1:17:03] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:07] to resist the pressures of today
[1:17:11] because they are everywhere.
[1:17:14] The pressures are high.
[1:17:17] And these people have enticement
[1:17:21] like maybe when you are in some of these
[1:17:23] places where you reside in your host or
[1:17:25] colleges,
[1:17:28] you get your roommate.
[1:17:31] He's having this big screen.
[1:17:37] He's having this kind of iPhone.
[1:17:45] Where do you get them from? You come, I
[1:17:47] show you. There are people who put in
[1:17:50] her
[1:17:52] and she's already defiled.
[1:17:55] And now people look at these things and
[1:18:00] value them
[1:18:02] more than their lives.
[1:18:05] That's the world we're living in. Like
[1:18:07] some of these universities,
[1:18:10] you get most of the professor students.
[1:18:15] just selling themselves over the weekend
[1:18:19] and these this these people who are rich
[1:18:22] knowh
[1:18:24] the university students
[1:18:26] you give them this and you finish
[1:18:31] daughters of the land so wicked
[1:18:35] so immoral
[1:18:38] you know and then for you those are your
[1:18:40] close pray.
[1:18:43] Whatever they say, you just take it up.
[1:18:47] Wherever they want you to go, you also
[1:18:49] go
[1:18:50] because they have an expensive handbag.
[1:18:54] Now for you maybe is almost torn
[1:18:59] or is just locally made.
[1:19:05] Now you look at that person
[1:19:10] also
[1:19:12] a sheep following a goat
[1:19:17] and those gods are smart
[1:19:21] they know what to do at a particular
[1:19:23] time
[1:19:26] ship when you go once
[1:19:33] this is what is happening you don't
[1:19:36] The Bible tells us don't be equally
[1:19:39] yolked
[1:19:42] many believers for them. They are in
[1:19:45] their world
[1:19:46] they have gone into the depth of
[1:19:48] wickedness.
[1:19:50] So when they tell you something
[1:19:53] to them it is something small.
[1:19:58] Why are you crying? He has not given you
[1:20:01] money.
[1:20:03] You have got the money.
[1:20:04] Why are you conscious is seared with a
[1:20:08] hot iron.
[1:20:15] So she doesn't care
[1:20:18] having the other one the other side
[1:20:20] having the other on the other
[1:20:22] side breaking this marriage making this
[1:20:26] fight one another
[1:20:28] they are demon possessed
[1:20:30] can be like a demon
[1:20:33] you know demons want you to do wrong and
[1:20:36] then they come aside and start laughing
[1:20:39] that's what they are daughters of the
[1:20:41] land
[1:20:43] wicked
[1:20:45] and Now you bring this to be your
[1:20:47] influence
[1:20:50] or sometimes
[1:20:52] people are married and then they want to
[1:20:55] go to people whose marriages have failed
[1:20:59] to be your counselors.
[1:21:02] What are they going to cancel you to
[1:21:04] break your home?
[1:21:08] That is what is happening.
[1:21:10] And then they are going to put on some
[1:21:12] radio program
[1:21:16] where they are speaking lies
[1:21:18] and then they want to take that cancel
[1:21:20] from the radio.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's happening these days
[1:21:27] or which film they like most. I don't
[1:21:29] know.
[1:21:32] America.
[1:21:34] I don't know.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know. And then they want to get
[1:21:37] those characters
[1:21:41] to be their source of influence
[1:21:46] seeing the daughters of the land.
[1:21:49] Now
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; anything
[1:21:54] let us go and pick this scripture
[1:21:57] in verse 26
[1:22:00] that's Genesis 34:26
[1:22:05] and they threw hammer and Sheckchim his
[1:22:08] son with the edge of the sword and took
[1:22:10] dinner out of Sheckchham's house and
[1:22:13] went out and the sons of Jacob came upon
[1:22:16] the the slain and spoiled the city
[1:22:20] because they had defiled their sister.
[1:22:27] [Music]
[1:22:56] Now you can imagine they had not given
[1:22:59] dinner into marriage
[1:23:02] but She's already living in Shakam's
[1:23:04] house.
[1:23:07] And many people are in those kind of
[1:23:09] situations.
[1:23:11] Just get a young man and then you just
[1:23:15] go, pack your things, go into his house
[1:23:20] or maybe a young woman get into her
[1:23:22] house.
[1:23:24] Now the question is, who gave you?
[1:23:32] Is it the street where you met her which
[1:23:33] gave you
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:39] or the place of work which gave you
[1:23:44] because daughters are given in marriage
[1:23:50] and it is their parents who give the
[1:23:52] daughters into marriage
[1:23:56] not starting the other way around.
[1:24:00] No.
[1:24:02] Daughters are given in marriage
[1:24:05] and our sisters who are here.
[1:24:08] Make sure you don't go with any man
[1:24:12] if not given if they have not given you
[1:24:14] to that
[1:24:16] and make sure you don't sleep with any
[1:24:18] man
[1:24:20] until you are rightly married.
[1:24:24] That should be your purpose in your
[1:24:25] heart.
[1:24:27] And when you have that purpose in your
[1:24:29] heart,
[1:24:30] God will always give you grace to
[1:24:33] overcome the temptation that come.
[1:24:36] You must also resolve in your heart
[1:24:40] to behave like the rest of the girls
[1:24:43] because I lack this
[1:24:46] you will pay my school fees.
[1:24:48] Now you are giving your body because of
[1:24:51] school fees. How many is it doing the
[1:24:53] same thing?
[1:25:00] So you don't try to get yourself
[1:25:03] lowered.
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:10] Do something wrong. Value yourself.
[1:25:14] Hold your integrity.
[1:25:18] I cannot sleep with a man unless I'm
[1:25:20] rightly married.
[1:25:23] You must resolve
[1:25:25] to keep yourself pure
[1:25:28] and not like the daughters of the land.
[1:25:31] For the daughters of the land, that is a
[1:25:33] game.
[1:25:36] Ah, this weekend I'm going to go to this
[1:25:38] place. I'm going to find out how these
[1:25:40] are.
[1:25:42] So when that is over, I think let me try
[1:25:44] another
[1:25:46] it is part of their life.
[1:25:48] as children of God. That is not our
[1:25:51] world.
[1:25:53] That's not that's not how we marry.
[1:25:56] That's not how we find out how men they
[1:25:58] are.
[1:25:59] Do that. Even brothers,
[1:26:03] you know, you don't start saying, "Let
[1:26:04] me check this one first."
[1:26:07] When you finish her, you put her aside,
[1:26:10] then you go to another.
[1:26:12] And some of them are serpents.
[1:26:17] The serpent
[1:26:19] will always come to you
[1:26:22] in the unguarded moment.
[1:26:28] You know I'm also brother
[1:26:31] why don't you come to ginger
[1:26:34] where we can meet at dat
[1:26:39] then you see you know they have good
[1:26:41] boat
[1:26:42] there is a brother
[1:26:46] serpent
[1:26:50] serpent
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; and then there are those serpent
[1:26:55] when you say I'm going to ask the pastor
[1:26:58] You mean you not mature enough to
[1:27:04] Are you still a young guy?
[1:27:10] So they defile this one
[1:27:12] and their mission is just to sleeping
[1:27:18] off.
[1:27:21] I don't know why that girl is but he
[1:27:23] knows what he has done to her.
[1:27:26] Then he goes to another same thing then
[1:27:29] another same thing then another same
[1:27:32] thing
[1:27:34] serpents.
[1:27:36] So you need to see that you watch this
[1:27:38] wicked spirit.
[1:27:42] See that you know any step you are going
[1:27:44] to take
[1:27:47] you are protected
[1:27:49] when you talk about it to others.
[1:27:52] Talk to your parents about I don't know
[1:27:54] why this brother does this.
[1:27:57] Are you sure? I don't know why this one
[1:27:59] does this.
[1:28:02] And now those people who are fear to be
[1:28:04] exposed
[1:28:07] know there is something wrong with them.
[1:28:13] They want to press you there in secret.
[1:28:15] By the time you mention
[1:28:18] it's finished,
[1:28:20] done deal.
[1:28:22] Are you going to force him to take you?
[1:28:25] No.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; But he has finished what he wanted.
[1:28:29] The daughters of the land
[1:28:32] because Satan is so cheeky.
[1:28:37] He will come maybe look at where your
[1:28:39] weakness is
[1:28:41] and then he says, "Ah, she doesn't have
[1:28:44] this.
[1:28:46] The parents pay school fees but they
[1:28:48] don't give enough pocket money.
[1:28:51] Then he comes there to be uncle
[1:28:58] just to supply.
[1:29:03] Now when they when he comes at your host
[1:29:06] ah this is my uncle
[1:29:10] but has happened.
[1:29:13] Then your friend
[1:29:16] when you get from home
[1:29:20] your uncle comes here.
[1:29:28] They get uncles.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; They get aunts
[1:29:34] and they have people just kind of meet
[1:29:37] their needs.
[1:29:40] You eat the devil's money.
[1:29:43] There is something is after you.
[1:29:49] And if you don't meet what they telling
[1:29:50] you to do,
[1:29:53] they rather put you broadcast.
[1:30:01] That's what the devil does. He doesn't
[1:30:04] give for free.
[1:30:11] Then you get yourself fully exposed
[1:30:15] because they have nothing to fear.
[1:30:19] They have nothing to lose.
[1:30:22] Now for you, you'll get yourself in that
[1:30:24] kind of mess
[1:30:28] and then you try to do damage control,
[1:30:33] but you've been pierced terrible.
[1:30:37] So be careful.
[1:30:39] These spirits keep around.
[1:30:43] Resolve yourself
[1:30:46] not to defile yourself.
[1:30:48] Whether you at a college, whether you at
[1:30:51] a university or you at a place of work,
[1:30:56] not to defile you.
[1:30:58] Praise the name of God. Don't allow to
[1:31:00] go with those people.
[1:31:04] Don't
[1:31:05] somebody's interested in marriage.
[1:31:09] You know how to do it to the pastor.
[1:31:13] Your parents if they can't stand that
[1:31:18] they are not worth
[1:31:20] they are not worth. Praise the name of
[1:31:23] Allah. Don't be like Dina
[1:31:27] loves me.
[1:31:29] Defiled her
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; and then she kind of comes back to do
[1:31:34] trouble. Trouble kind of you know
[1:31:39] and then you know you need also to know
[1:31:42] spirits of fornication
[1:31:45] and adultery
[1:31:47] they are with spirits of murder.
[1:31:52] They are following the spirits of
[1:31:54] murder.
[1:31:56] He and she did it
[1:31:59] and the whole men of the city were
[1:32:00] killed.
[1:32:03] Why? fornication.
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; They have followed
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; when
[1:32:12] when Ammon
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; defiled Tamar
[1:32:19] Amn was killed
[1:32:23] they follow.
[1:32:25] you are in a dangerous ground
[1:32:30] to do into those kind of
[1:32:32] like I remember I think about 30 years
[1:32:34] ago
[1:32:36] most of them most of that was in the '9s
[1:32:40] they used to kill a lot of students of
[1:32:42] the university girls of the university
[1:32:47] they have shot this one
[1:32:50] but the whole thing comes back to that
[1:32:54] paid her fees.
[1:32:56] Now when she's finishing, she's going
[1:32:59] with another person. Says, "We can't I
[1:33:01] can't lose." Kills her.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Dangerous grounds.
[1:33:08] So see that you don't get into the hands
[1:33:10] of Satan.
[1:33:13] Don't go and do things the way the
[1:33:15] daughters of land do.
[1:33:19] So the the children of Jacob, they came
[1:33:22] upon a city boldly
[1:33:25] and killed all the men.
[1:33:29] And then they said to their father, why
[1:33:32] should he deal with our sister as a
[1:33:35] hallot?
[1:33:41] Verse 31.
[1:33:50] Now,
[1:33:52] you are not meant to play a harot.
[1:33:57] When you're in your father's house,
[1:34:00] you sleep with a man who is not your
[1:34:01] husband.
[1:34:04] When you're not married, you are playing
[1:34:07] a harot.
[1:34:09] That's what the scripture is saying
[1:34:10] here.
[1:34:12] Why
[1:34:13] should we she deal with our sister?
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:22] That's the one they have not given.
[1:34:28] I've got this. I'm also giving out my
[1:34:30] body.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; That's hallow tree.
[1:34:33] Now in Deuteronomy chapter 22
[1:34:39] and verse 13 to verse 14,
[1:34:49] he says, "If any man take a wife and go
[1:34:52] in unto her and hate her and give
[1:34:55] occasions of speech against her and
[1:34:58] bring up an evil name upon her, and say,
[1:35:02] I took this woman. And when I came to
[1:35:04] her, I found her not a maid.
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:32] Now marriage in the scriptures
[1:35:36] was for virgins.
[1:35:39] Virgins.
[1:35:41] And then there are some people who
[1:35:42] consult themselves.
[1:35:48] They are not virgins.
[1:35:52] Now they already confessing to you.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not a virgin
[1:35:57] but they are.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; No I'm saying they are virgins.
[1:36:03] Now if for you are not one
[1:36:05] doesn't mean others are not.
[1:36:09] So now they console themselves.
[1:36:16] Where are you going to get a virgin?
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; God has always got a
[1:36:26] he retains those who are faithful in his
[1:36:28] word.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; When there was a lot of idol worship in
[1:36:31] Israel,
[1:36:33] the prophet was saying, "I'm the only
[1:36:36] one left."
[1:36:38] God said, "No, I am 7,000.
[1:36:43] Praise the name of our Lord. There are
[1:36:45] those who keep the word of God.
[1:36:48] Praise the name of our Lord. Because
[1:36:50] once God says it, there are those people
[1:36:54] God has ordained
[1:36:56] to keep his word.
[1:36:59] And God knows where they are. Praise the
[1:37:02] name of. So if you want one God has
[1:37:05] kept,
[1:37:07] you ask him, God, I want this one.
[1:37:11] Praise the name. Not a consolation.
[1:37:19] So now when a man found a wife was not a
[1:37:23] virgin,
[1:37:27] he had to go to the parents.
[1:37:29] right now when you continue reading that
[1:37:31] scripture
[1:37:33] that's why
[1:37:35] let us go and pick it in Matthew chapter
[1:37:40] 19
[1:37:43] Matthew chapter 19
[1:37:46] then verse 9
[1:37:51] the Bible says and I say unto you
[1:37:55] whosoever shall put away his wife,
[1:38:00] except it be for fornication,
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:06] and shall marry another
[1:38:10] committeth adultery.
[1:38:12] And so marries that that is put away
[1:38:17] commits adultery.
[1:38:19] Now they are looking at fornication.
[1:38:23] But this parade married. So when did
[1:38:27] what is fornication?
[1:38:29] Fornication is an act when one is not
[1:38:32] married.
[1:38:36] Adulter is an act when somebody is
[1:38:38] married.
[1:38:40] So then he says the reason of divorcing
[1:38:43] a wife
[1:38:46] is in case she fornicated before she met
[1:38:48] you.
[1:38:53] That's why
[1:38:55] Praise the name of the Lord. When
[1:38:57] somebody takes interest in you
[1:39:01] and is serious,
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; it's good to confess it
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; to that person
[1:39:09] say that there is no time in future
[1:39:17] you fornicated.
[1:39:20] But I told you
[1:39:23] now.
[1:39:25] Praise the name of Allah. Also, it's
[1:39:29] because I fornicated.
[1:39:33] I don't have to tell everybody that I
[1:39:34] fornicated.
[1:39:38] Tell the person who is wife
[1:39:41] who is serious.
[1:39:48] Sister, how are you standing? You may
[1:39:50] not be worth that talk.
[1:40:00] Sister refused to tell me. Are you
[1:40:02] really serious?
[1:40:13] There are some of those kind of
[1:40:17] that's not right.
[1:40:23] No, that's not right.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; I didn't because the respect and guility
[1:40:29] and actually it's the fear of God
[1:40:32] when one confesses that
[1:40:36] shows they fear God.
[1:40:39] Praise the name of the Lord. So now one
[1:40:43] has to confess
[1:40:47] I'm not a virgin.
[1:40:50] Now don't ask now who did you go with?
[1:40:58] Why did you go with him?
[1:41:03] You know but there are some who want to
[1:41:05] get the story right.
[1:41:10] What age were you when you did that?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Where were you?
[1:41:18] You don't do those kind of things.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Let us go back to our story.
[1:41:24] They told me chapter 22
[1:41:27] and then verse 20.
[1:41:31] The Bible says,
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; "But if the thing be true, and the
[1:41:36] tokens of virginity be not formed for
[1:41:38] the dam cell, then they shall bring out
[1:41:41] the dame cell to the door of her
[1:41:43] father's house, and the men of her city
[1:41:46] shall stone her with stones that she
[1:41:49] died, because she has wrought for in
[1:41:52] Israel to play the war in her father's
[1:41:55] house. So shalt thou put evil away from
[1:41:58] among you. for
[1:42:29] Israel.
[1:42:42] Now it says she played a war
[1:42:49] a harot
[1:42:52] my father's house so you should take it
[1:42:55] serious
[1:42:57] I should not behave
[1:43:00] like the daughters of the land. The
[1:43:02] daughters of the land, they do these
[1:43:04] things and they don't care.
[1:43:08] Don't behave like the daughters of the
[1:43:09] land
[1:43:12] for them. They don't care.
[1:43:15] Doesn't care how many times,
[1:43:18] how many they have
[1:43:20] care. That's their life.
[1:43:24] Praise the name of the Lord. That's
[1:43:26] their life.
[1:43:28] It matters a lot to God
[1:43:31] how you live your life. It matters a lot
[1:43:35] to brother.
[1:43:37] You can imagine he was still young.
[1:43:40] But then the angel told him, "Don't
[1:43:42] defile yourself.
[1:43:46] Don't smoke.
[1:43:48] Don't drink."
[1:43:50] You should do the same thing also. I'm
[1:43:53] not going to defile myself.
[1:43:55] I'm not going to sleep with anyone.
[1:43:58] I'm not going to sleep with any man
[1:44:00] until I get the right husband.
[1:44:04] You resolve as a young woman
[1:44:07] as a young woman. I'm not going to mess
[1:44:10] up my life. I'm not going to behave like
[1:44:13] the daughters of the land.
[1:44:15] I'm not going to behave like the sons of
[1:44:17] the land.
[1:44:18] To them, they can do anything.
[1:44:21] They can speak anything. I don't care
[1:44:23] what they do.
[1:44:25] I'm a child of God.
[1:44:28] Praise the name of God. You need to
[1:44:29] resolve that in your life. I'm not going
[1:44:32] to mess up my life. I'm keeping my body
[1:44:35] pure
[1:44:37] for my future husband,
[1:44:40] my future wife, and I'm not going to
[1:44:42] mess up myself.
[1:44:44] Praise the name of some of those
[1:44:46] scenarios.
[1:44:49] You know, when a brother has already
[1:44:50] convinced a sister
[1:44:53] sister
[1:44:55] for you are mine.
[1:44:58] They have not given her to you.
[1:45:01] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:45:04] They have not yet given her to you. Wait
[1:45:08] until you are blessed in church
[1:45:11] and they declare husband and wife.
[1:45:16] There you are free. But before that
[1:45:20] you are not free.
[1:45:23] Praise the name of the Lord. So you have
[1:45:25] to be careful how you associate with
[1:45:32] everyone knows that this one is mine.
[1:45:34] There was a scenario
[1:45:38] certain brother was talking to a certain
[1:45:40] sister. Not really not really serious.
[1:45:44] They were all in school
[1:45:48] and then this one
[1:45:50] because he knows this one is mine.
[1:45:53] When another goes to attack
[1:45:57] then the girl puts noise.
[1:46:00] Ah this one is disturbing me but the
[1:46:03] other one is not disturbing them. But
[1:46:05] they are students
[1:46:07] just this kind of useful kind of funny.
[1:46:12] That's not right.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And we
[1:46:16] encourage people to think of marriage
[1:46:20] when you are done with your school.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; You know, you in school for 3 years,
[1:46:27] your college or university, 3 years,
[1:46:31] four years, 5 years. Why don't you
[1:46:34] finish that?
[1:46:36] Why don't you put all your mind on that?
[1:46:40] Your parents are paying school.
[1:46:43] Concentrate on that and finish
[1:46:47] and then when you finish that just when
[1:46:49] you can think about
[1:46:52] other is going to affect your
[1:46:53] performance
[1:46:56] and the quality of paper you're going to
[1:46:57] come up with.
[1:47:00] You will be not good enough. But yet the
[1:47:03] paper you worked for 3 years, four years
[1:47:07] can affect the rest of your life.
[1:47:11] You're not getting good job
[1:47:12] opportunities
[1:47:13] because you didn't pass away. But yet
[1:47:16] the thing of marriage is until death.
[1:47:20] Then why are you running into it when
[1:47:21] you're not ready?
[1:47:25] Finish one thing at a time.
[1:47:28] When you're in school,
[1:47:30] business of school,
[1:47:32] it's until you finish school
[1:47:35] about marriage.
[1:47:37] Even our brothers should be respectful.
[1:47:42] You know the sister is at school. Why
[1:47:44] don't you be patient?
[1:47:48] Why do you want to go first booking?
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; And being fast is not the one who takes.
[1:47:56] So don't again start complaining. I used
[1:47:59] to send pocket money. Who told you?
[1:48:03] I used to do V station when the parents
[1:48:05] didn't come.
[1:48:08] Even when the host was not there, I used
[1:48:10] to pay her host.
[1:48:13] That's a risky venture.
[1:48:20] So you don't start coming around.
[1:48:25] You don't.
[1:48:27] There was a scenario which I was told in
[1:48:28] Zimbabwe Zimbabwe. These brothers got
[1:48:32] themselves through some kind of business
[1:48:33] scheme.
[1:48:36] It was related with something either
[1:48:38] around marriage or whatever
[1:48:41] and then the other people relocated to
[1:48:43] another country.
[1:48:46] Now the thing backfires
[1:48:48] and now they come to the pastor. But
[1:48:51] when you started you didn't come to the
[1:48:52] pastor.
[1:48:55] Now you want him to do what possible.
[1:49:01] Now my business collapse. All my capital
[1:49:03] went to her.
[1:49:08] There was a court case here in Uganda.
[1:49:12] There was a court case here in Uganda.
[1:49:15] I think the man was in UK.
[1:49:19] The woman was in Uganda
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; and they started on those areas of
[1:49:23] relationship. The other one kept on
[1:49:26] sending money to invest
[1:49:29] and the woman was smart. Got the money
[1:49:32] did what she did but the papers were not
[1:49:35] in the other money.
[1:49:37] The investment has reached somewhere
[1:49:40] says we interested in you.
[1:49:44] The man goes to the court, you know, I
[1:49:46] put in this
[1:49:49] and then the judge said, "I was under
[1:49:52] love.
[1:49:54] You don't demand those things." Now,
[1:49:58] that sister did this to me,
[1:50:01] whatever happened there,
[1:50:04] forgive
[1:50:06] aside, move forward.
[1:50:11] You know people get themselves into
[1:50:13] those kind of messes.
[1:50:17] I did this. I did this. That mean that
[1:50:20] if you married her
[1:50:23] you would start telling her
[1:50:26] it.
[1:50:30] Don't get yourself into relationship
[1:50:33] relationship when it's not time
[1:50:39] and it's not going fast.
[1:50:41] It's me who went fast who came recently
[1:50:45] is wrong.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; It is not going fast.
[1:50:53] Praise the name of
[1:50:55] you know when you get into those areas
[1:50:58] they are mind troubling.
[1:51:00] That's why you shouldn't do them when
[1:51:02] you're in school.
[1:51:04] Don't do them when you're in school.
[1:51:07] Any relationship,
[1:51:09] start them after school.
[1:51:14] Praise the name of Lord. So let us get
[1:51:17] into another scripture. Here
[1:51:22] we go to numbers 30.
[1:51:29] And then verse one,
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; and Moses spoke unto the heads of the
[1:51:36] tribes of
[1:51:38] concerning the children of Israel,
[1:51:40] saying, "This is the thing which the
[1:51:42] Lord has commanded. If a man make a vow
[1:51:45] unto the Lord or swear an oath to bind
[1:51:48] his soul with a b, he shall not break
[1:51:51] his word. He shall do according to all
[1:51:54] that proceeds out of his mouth.
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:52:27] If a woman also v a vo unto the Lord,
[1:52:30] and bind herself by a bond, being in her
[1:52:34] father's house, in her youth, and her
[1:52:36] father hear her vo, and her bond
[1:52:39] wherewith she has bound her soul, and
[1:52:41] her father shall hold his peace at her,
[1:52:43] then all her vo shall stand, and even
[1:52:46] every bone wherewith she has bound her
[1:52:48] soul shall stand. But if her father
[1:52:51] disallow her in the day that heareth,
[1:52:54] not any of her voice or her bones
[1:52:57] wherewith she has bowed herself shall
[1:52:59] stand, and the Lord shall forgive her
[1:53:01] because her father disallowed her.
[1:53:12] Fore!
[1:53:21] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:31] forch.
[1:54:09] Now the B the Bible says
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; the father
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; has a right
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; to anal you've made as a young woman
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; to to to anal to disallow
[1:54:31] That's why
[1:54:33] if you are not married,
[1:54:35] you are in your father's house.
[1:54:38] He's concerned about you.
[1:54:42] So he's the one to give you in marriage.
[1:54:47] Praise the name of our Lord. And as a
[1:54:49] young woman,
[1:54:51] you should be happy
[1:54:53] to sit your parents who are giving you
[1:54:55] into marriage.
[1:54:59] not your place of work.
[1:55:02] You get a man at place of work.
[1:55:09] Who gave you the man?
[1:55:14] your neighbor,
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; the father is given this responsibility
[1:55:25] to give the daughter into marriage.
[1:55:28] And that's why it is important.
[1:55:31] If somebody is interested in you,
[1:55:34] make it known to your parents.
[1:55:37] If your parents have raised you,
[1:55:40] they have raised you up to that level,
[1:55:44] why wouldn't you trust your parents
[1:55:47] to help you in making decision of
[1:55:48] marriage?
[1:55:50] Why? Of course, I know there are parents
[1:55:52] who would want to force
[1:55:55] or maybe unless you go with this tribe,
[1:55:58] unless you go with this religion.
[1:56:03] So it should not be that I'm now because
[1:56:05] of this I'm going to do this.
[1:56:11] Approach it respectfully.
[1:56:14] Praise the name of God. Approach it
[1:56:16] respectfully.
[1:56:19] So a father would announce the
[1:56:22] daughter's war.
[1:56:28] I'm going with this man said no
[1:56:32] Bible allows it here
[1:56:35] the Bible allows it that's why when you
[1:56:38] are coming into issues of marriage
[1:56:41] there's an aspect of good faith
[1:56:51] you have done it in good faith
[1:56:53] you are not marrying because you are
[1:56:55] hiding some things behind
[1:57:01] Don't tell you not good fight
[1:57:07] or you have some sickness.
[1:57:10] Then you you even go and bribe the
[1:57:12] medical people, the laboratory.
[1:57:17] That's not in good faith.
[1:57:21] So it should be done in good faith.
[1:57:24] Praise the name of make it known to the
[1:57:27] other person.
[1:57:29] Why would you want that person to
[1:57:30] discover after some time?
[1:57:33] Then you'll bleach your trust
[1:57:37] and everything will be suspicious.
[1:57:41] It's just like people who sleep with one
[1:57:44] another before they are married.
[1:57:48] Just like people who sleep with one
[1:57:51] another
[1:57:53] before they are married,
[1:57:55] they will never have trust in their
[1:57:57] home.
[1:57:59] When the other one goes the other side,
[1:58:08] I know my husband
[1:58:10] no trust
[1:58:14] because you couldn't wait.
[1:58:18] So each of you doesn't trust the other.
[1:58:21] When your wife gets a job,
[1:58:24] you won't put spies at place of work
[1:58:28] because you don't trust.
[1:58:32] You know what you did to her so others
[1:58:34] can do the same thing.
[1:58:36] So there's no trust.
[1:58:39] So don't do those kind of things
[1:58:42] until you are married.
[1:58:44] I feel like shaking
[1:58:50] then I go back to the parish.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Let me first
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; do the right things first.
[1:58:57] Praise the name of And then you have
[1:58:59] that trust for one another,
[1:59:02] confidence.
[1:59:04] You know, even if I'm away for a whole
[1:59:05] month, my husband will not go with
[1:59:07] another person.
[1:59:10] my wife will not go with another person.
[1:59:13] But because you waited on one another,
[1:59:17] you built that trust.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So we need
[1:59:21] to see that we don't go after the way
[1:59:24] the world does their things.
[1:59:28] You know the world they do their evil
[1:59:31] things
[1:59:34] and they don't care
[1:59:36] because they are under that kind of
[1:59:38] situation.
[1:59:42] And so they want you to get trapped into
[1:59:44] them.
[1:59:47] Let us go to numbers chapter 25
[1:59:51] and then verse one.
[1:59:55] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[1:59:58] says and Israel abode in the people
[2:00:02] began to commit wardom with daughters of
[2:00:05] Moab.
[2:00:12] What happened?
[2:00:14] They were there and then these girls of
[2:00:17] Moab,
[2:00:19] they knew how to strip themselves,
[2:00:25] stripping themselves,
[2:00:27] fashion show
[2:00:33] painting themselves.
[2:00:36] And then there are some people
[2:00:39] they want to marry after people now to
[2:00:41] strip themselves.
[2:00:48] You know I was
[2:00:54] say I was not now to dress well but
[2:01:00] tight clothes
[2:01:03] and the whole body is visible.
[2:01:06] Daughters of Moab
[2:01:09] stripped themselves
[2:01:11] and then they came to dances.
[2:01:15] Then the the Jews were looking at her
[2:01:19] looks at the wife
[2:01:22] said,
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; looks at the other one and the Bible say
[2:01:30] they burnt with lust.
[2:01:35] It was it was a party
[2:01:42] everything
[2:01:47] as we have.
[2:01:55] You're the one who has gone.
[2:01:58] You're the one who has gone there.
[2:02:02] just funny funny places.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says they called the people
[2:02:13] to the sacrifices of their gods and the
[2:02:16] people did eat and bow down to their
[2:02:19] gods.
[2:02:29] Now these people have no shame.
[2:02:33] These things they have been doing them
[2:02:34] over and over
[2:02:37] now you are seeing it for the first
[2:02:38] time.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; You think that is so bad? Those are the
[2:02:45] daughters of the
[2:02:47] used to put on a
[2:02:50] se.
[2:02:57] Why do you go under the daughters of the
[2:02:59] land?
[2:03:02] For them, they used to dress
[2:03:05] until they press their breasts up
[2:03:10] and they come out
[2:03:13] until they want to breastfeed everybody.
[2:03:18] And you want to be like the daughters of
[2:03:19] the land.
[2:03:24] This is a new style.
[2:03:26] They are daughters of the land.
[2:03:30] They know how to dress
[2:03:32] and they put on sleeveless
[2:03:40] expose their nerves
[2:03:45] their back
[2:03:48] and some of them use damage.
[2:03:56] They put on damage
[2:03:58] and they know where to put it.
[2:04:05] And as long as you somebody with a
[2:04:07] damage,
[2:04:09] your brain is also damaged
[2:04:12] and you go with a damaged brain,
[2:04:16] you must also be damaged.
[2:04:20] Daughters of the land, you know, they
[2:04:23] don't care.
[2:04:27] So the children of Israel,
[2:04:30] so these children of Moab,
[2:04:34] they don't care how they dance. They
[2:04:37] don't care how they sit. They don't care
[2:04:39] how they behave. They don't care what
[2:04:41] they do. They don't care how many men
[2:04:44] they go out with.
[2:04:47] Daughters of the land. So we need to be
[2:04:50] careful
[2:04:51] with the daughters of the land.
[2:04:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[2:05:00] days of Noah
[2:05:03] in Genesis chapter 6,
[2:05:06] let us go and read that scripture.
[2:05:08] I have pretty a lot but I don't think I
[2:05:11] can cover them
[2:05:14] because we've only gone 20%.
[2:05:22] Genesis chapter 6
[2:05:25] and then verse one.
[2:05:28] And it came to pass when the men began
[2:05:30] to multiply on the face of the earth,
[2:05:32] and the daughters were born unto them,
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; that the sons of God saw that the
[2:05:46] daughters of men that were a fair, and
[2:05:49] they took unto them wives, all of which
[2:05:52] they chose.
[2:06:02] Now see where all these scenarios keep
[2:06:05] on coming
[2:06:08] saw the daughters of the land
[2:06:12] she was taken into destruction.
[2:06:15] Then here the sons of God.
[2:06:19] Now the sons of God
[2:06:22] these are actually
[2:06:25] They were the descendants
[2:06:30] from Adam
[2:06:32] and S.
[2:06:34] They were the because Adam was the son
[2:06:36] of God.
[2:06:38] So Adam being the son of God.
[2:06:42] So his generation were the children of
[2:06:44] God.
[2:06:46] Now the daughters of men,
[2:06:49] they were the descendants of Cain.
[2:06:53] You get it?
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So it's not
[2:06:57] that the sons of God were fallen angels.
[2:07:05] It's not so.
[2:07:07] Praise the name of our Lord. The sons of
[2:07:09] God were coming from Adam. And you know
[2:07:13] they had a different place where they
[2:07:14] were living
[2:07:17] because when Cain fell,
[2:07:20] he went to the east.
[2:07:23] And there he started this civilization.
[2:07:26] Adam remained this particular place.
[2:07:29] And with his children, sons and
[2:07:32] daughters of God. And when the people
[2:07:35] multiply,
[2:07:37] the civilization, the people are now
[2:07:39] getting closer to one another.
[2:07:43] And now the sons of God raised in the
[2:07:46] fear of God. And the people increased,
[2:07:51] they started discovering other people.
[2:08:00] You mean you can change your skin?
[2:08:03] Me, I'm tired of being dark.
[2:08:08] You know, you come, we have we have
[2:08:10] chemicals,
[2:08:12] but there are those which doesn't work.
[2:08:16] He has maps on the face.
[2:08:23] when
[2:08:26] they saw
[2:08:28] said hey
[2:08:30] you know the daughters of men can do
[2:08:33] anything
[2:08:35] one day I was in town and then I was
[2:08:38] getting
[2:08:39] some clothes for the children
[2:08:42] then I saw something said what is this
[2:08:46] is a bomb
[2:08:51] said,
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; I got shocked.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; They don't care. They put them on.
[2:09:03] Put them on to seduce,
[2:09:07] daughters of the land,
[2:09:10] daughters of men.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; They know the world better.
[2:09:15] You can't be smarter than them.
[2:09:20] They know it better.
[2:09:23] There was a case, I think it was in
[2:09:24] Morocco, or Tunisia.
[2:09:27] A man went and got a woman, married her
[2:09:33] and now spent I think was it either
[2:09:35] something like either $10,000 or£10,000
[2:09:39] some money.
[2:09:42] Now, after 3 days after the wedding,
[2:09:46] He sees somebody in his house
[2:09:49] and thought he was a thief
[2:09:51] to come to realize it is his wife he had
[2:09:54] just
[2:09:57] but she had put too much makeup
[2:10:00] when he saw the real wife
[2:10:03] said you me
[2:10:06] took her to court
[2:10:08] for pretending to be what she's not
[2:10:13] makeup
[2:10:14] make up daughters of the land. So now
[2:10:18] when the sons of God saw
[2:10:21] men were fair,
[2:10:24] they took them to themselves wives
[2:10:28] wives and then it brought destruction.
[2:10:33] So we need to be careful
[2:10:36] about the way the world does their
[2:10:37] thing.
[2:10:39] We are children of the kingdom of God.
[2:10:42] Praise the name of our Lord. This is the
[2:10:44] way God expects us to behave.
[2:10:48] Why would you put on tight clothing?
[2:10:51] Why would you be seductive before men?
[2:10:55] Why don't you be, you know, dress well
[2:10:59] with respect of your body.
[2:11:02] Now let us spend some time on seeing
[2:11:05] before we close.
[2:11:09] Now the Bible says that the sons of God
[2:11:12] saw
[2:11:15] this seeing was dangerous.
[2:11:19] Dangerous scene
[2:11:21] just the same thing like in Genesis
[2:11:24] chapter 3
[2:11:27] and verse 6.
[2:11:29] And when the woman is saw
[2:11:33] dangerous scene
[2:11:36] because the tree was always there
[2:11:40] but she had not taken this new
[2:11:42] knowledge.
[2:11:45] She had not taken an understanding.
[2:11:50] So she was attracted.
[2:11:53] She was taken you know by some kind of
[2:11:55] you know desire.
[2:11:58] And this is what the devil does.
[2:12:01] When the sons of God saw,
[2:12:05] they had a different scene.
[2:12:09] They see that God sees them.
[2:12:12] When God saw the daughters of men,
[2:12:16] he was seeing them as the serpent.
[2:12:19] But now when the sons of God saw the the
[2:12:21] daughters of men,
[2:12:24] they saw them as equal to be wives.
[2:12:27] Where the danger is.
[2:12:30] When you look at the world, what do you
[2:12:33] see? What understanding do you perceive
[2:12:35] in this world?
[2:12:38] Do you take the understanding of the
[2:12:40] world
[2:12:42] which is under destruction?
[2:12:44] Do you take the understanding of God
[2:12:47] to know that these people in their
[2:12:49] condition
[2:12:53] they need to be changed?
[2:12:56] Praise the name of our Lord. You don't
[2:12:58] just get a woman outside,
[2:13:01] then just bring in her in
[2:13:04] just marry her when she's not converted.
[2:13:08] You are seeing like the sons of God.
[2:13:12] You need to see the way God sees them.
[2:13:16] Praise the name of our need to be
[2:13:18] daughters of God
[2:13:21] before you can take them as your wife.
[2:13:24] Praise the name of our Lord. You need to
[2:13:26] look at things. The way God looks at
[2:13:29] them
[2:13:31] such that you know this man has a curse
[2:13:35] on him.
[2:13:37] This woman has a curse on him. The curse
[2:13:40] of sin
[2:13:42] because they have never repented
[2:13:44] and don't just bring them inside.
[2:13:47] Make up their repentance.
[2:13:51] What happened? I was there and I used to
[2:13:54] listen to this program.
[2:13:57] You come to be saved.
[2:13:59] [Music]
[2:14:02] Preach, marry, convert.
[2:14:06] [Music]
[2:14:10] They have a curse.
[2:14:13] So you need to tell them first have the
[2:14:15] curse removed
[2:14:18] by the blood of Jesus.
[2:14:20] Praise the name of And then you don't go
[2:14:23] to somebody to preach to them
[2:14:25] because you want to marry them. That's a
[2:14:28] wrong spirit.
[2:14:30] You are doing like the sons of God
[2:14:34] to the daughters of men.
[2:14:37] Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[2:14:39] should not do those kind of things.
[2:14:44] Somebody should be converted.
[2:14:48] Somebody should see that you know they
[2:14:50] have come under the change in their
[2:14:52] lives.
[2:14:55] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; We need to see that we get the people
[2:14:59] who have already been delivered from the
[2:15:02] curse of sin.
[2:15:05] Not somebody under the curse.
[2:15:08] They have no fear of God.
[2:15:11] They do things the way they want to do
[2:15:12] them.
[2:15:15] Praise the name of our Lord. But we need
[2:15:18] to see that we do things under the fear
[2:15:20] of God.
[2:15:24] Let us go to Revelation 17.
[2:15:27] [Music]
[2:15:31] They also daughters in Revelation 17.
[2:15:36] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:15:38] The Bible says,
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; "And there came one of the seven angels,
[2:15:43] which had the seven vials, and talked
[2:15:45] with me, saying unto me, come hither,
[2:15:48] I'll show unto thee the judgment of the
[2:15:50] great war that siteth upon many waters.
[2:16:12] [Music]
[2:16:15] Now she was a great war
[2:16:18] and she had daughters,
[2:16:22] daughters of the Lord.
[2:16:25] The Bible says in verse 5, "And upon her
[2:16:28] forehead was name written, mystery
[2:16:30] Babylon the great, the mother of hallots
[2:16:34] and abominations of the earth.
[2:16:51] [Music]
[2:16:52] religious systems
[2:16:55] and then you go to their fellowships
[2:17:00] and you want to behave the way they
[2:17:02] came,
[2:17:04] daughters of the land.
[2:17:07] But God has given us a message
[2:17:10] which puts the standard of what we have
[2:17:13] to follow.
[2:17:16] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[2:17:18] to see that we stay with the message.
[2:17:22] Take it. Let it influence your life. Let
[2:17:26] it influence your way you serve God.
[2:17:30] How you worship God. How you live your
[2:17:33] life. how you live in your family,
[2:17:37] how you do your work.
[2:17:39] Let us have the message take total
[2:17:41] inflow,
[2:17:43] not the daughters of the land, the
[2:17:46] denominational systems of the world
[2:17:49] because they are under judgment.
[2:17:52] They rejected the leadership of the Holy
[2:17:54] Spirit.
[2:17:55] They reject the leadership of the
[2:17:56] message of
[2:17:59] under judgment.
[2:18:01] Why would you fall down with it?
[2:18:03] Why would you want to get their
[2:18:04] influence?
[2:18:07] Praise the name of our Lord. In the
[2:18:09] message, the God of this evil age
[2:18:13] in paragraph 18.
[2:18:16] Notice the sons of God saw the daughters
[2:18:18] of men,
[2:18:21] not the daughters of God, the daughters
[2:18:24] of men,
[2:18:26] that they were beautiful.
[2:18:29] And it caused the sons of God
[2:18:32] to fall into this delusion
[2:18:37] and took them kind of women
[2:18:41] and married them. And it brought an age
[2:18:44] of prostitution,
[2:18:48] just like it is today,
[2:18:50] like it was in Sodom,
[2:18:53] like it is predicted to be today.
[2:18:59] Now these are things which happen in the
[2:19:01] world.
[2:19:03] These people don't care what they do
[2:19:05] and then brother Brandham was talking
[2:19:07] about here.
[2:19:09] How men and women of this day
[2:19:12] they swap wives
[2:19:16] and they don't care. And then he says
[2:19:20] if they don't like this wife,
[2:19:24] they go over to Reno
[2:19:26] or Nevada
[2:19:28] and get married or get a divorce.
[2:19:32] And that one and marry again 15 minutes
[2:19:38] when he finds this one is not suitable.
[2:19:41] And women so pretty that they are almost
[2:19:44] irresistible.
[2:19:52] And as it is, the devil sees Satan
[2:19:57] still in beauty.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Notice that sin was never forgiven them.
[2:20:06] And that's what the devil does. Now we
[2:20:09] can draw your attention.
[2:20:11] Something he knows is evil.
[2:20:14] When Balam
[2:20:16] when he saw God could not cast the
[2:20:18] children of Israel,
[2:20:21] he led wild
[2:20:30] here.
[2:20:32] Let us send our beautiful girls there.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; And now to use beautiful women
[2:20:38] to get information from senior army
[2:20:40] officers
[2:20:46] to use them. Those who are given to be
[2:20:48] used
[2:20:52] to use them. The other one is just a
[2:20:55] tool in the devil's hand.
[2:20:59] Doesn't care how she dresses.
[2:21:01] doesn't care what game she does
[2:21:04] as long as she gets what she wants.
[2:21:07] Like,
[2:21:09] if you love me, tell me this.
[2:21:12] Love me, tell me this. Until the Bible
[2:21:15] say,
[2:21:17] Samson's heart
[2:21:20] was so burdened
[2:21:22] and the only solution
[2:21:24] is to release the secret.
[2:21:27] But he was entangled with an evil woman.
[2:21:32] Let us not be entangled with the systems
[2:21:34] of the world.
[2:21:37] Don't go to see the daughters of the
[2:21:39] life
[2:21:40] and then they influence you. They
[2:21:43] influence your thinking.
[2:21:46] They influence your conduct. They
[2:21:48] influence your everything about
[2:21:52] the way they behave. They don't care how
[2:21:55] they treat their husband.
[2:22:01] I will leave him and get another one.
[2:22:03] You know, there's that funny song.
[2:22:06] You know, they say, "Why do you mar an
[2:22:08] old man?
[2:22:11] I I'll I'll divorce him and get another.
[2:22:16] They don't care. As long as the old man
[2:22:19] has money,
[2:22:22] sugar daddy
[2:22:24] will find my capital for the shop.
[2:22:30] Work on yourself.
[2:22:32] Dump the old man with the one you want.
[2:22:36] You can twist around. That's how the
[2:22:38] world does things. But we are not of the
[2:22:42] world. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[2:22:45] are children of God.
[2:22:47] There is a way we are meant to behave as
[2:22:49] children of God.
[2:22:52] Don't be equally yolked with unbelief.
[2:22:56] Don't be taken by the influences of this
[2:22:58] world.
[2:23:01] Praise the name of our Lord. Don't be
[2:23:03] taken
[2:23:05] by the things you just see
[2:23:08] and then you make a fast decision.
[2:23:12] Pray about every decision in your life.
[2:23:14] Pray to the Lord. Praise the name over
[2:23:19] and make sure that the devil doesn't
[2:23:21] trap you into something
[2:23:24] because the devil is smart.
[2:23:27] Like the way the woman had to get
[2:23:29] Joseph's shirt
[2:23:32] and then used the shirt as evidence.
[2:23:36] She was the one forcing him. But she
[2:23:38] said he was forcing me.
[2:23:42] Who would now defend Joseph? who would
[2:23:44] defend Joseph?
[2:23:47] And these are the systems we live under.
[2:23:50] So you need to be careful.
[2:23:52] Why would you stand with a woman alone
[2:23:56] in a place alone?
[2:23:58] What are you doing there?
[2:24:01] Praise the name of you know this one is
[2:24:04] this and this and this.
[2:24:08] Avoid suspicious places.
[2:24:13] Avoid suspicious people.
[2:24:18] Praise the name of our Lord. See that
[2:24:20] you live a life that is above reproach.
[2:24:26] Praise the name of our Lord. Anything
[2:24:28] that they may want to put on you,
[2:24:31] praise the name of our Lord. Let us jump
[2:24:33] there.
[2:24:34] Paragraph 21.
[2:24:39] says notice it was not like that God
[2:24:42] would interpret his word to Ken's evil
[2:24:44] generation.
[2:24:48] God would not interpret his word to
[2:24:50] them.
[2:24:53] God the knowledge to make a world so
[2:24:55] pretty and scientific sinful
[2:24:59] [Music]
[2:25:03] he had to destroy it.
[2:25:06] Would God do that to make a world so
[2:25:08] pretty?
[2:25:11] God making his daughters so pretty
[2:25:15] and dressed them so sexy
[2:25:18] and his sons would last after them and
[2:25:20] would commit adultery.
[2:25:24] God to do such a thing,
[2:25:27] you know. So we need to be conscious
[2:25:31] as a daughter of God, I should not
[2:25:34] behave like the daughters of the lamb.
[2:25:37] As a daughter of God, I don't behave
[2:25:39] like the daughters of men.
[2:25:42] Praise the name of God. See that you
[2:25:44] live a life that is upright
[2:25:47] in the fear of God, patiently waiting
[2:25:51] upon God.
[2:25:53] And don't allow to be defiled
[2:25:56] like dinner. She went out. She lost her
[2:26:01] protection
[2:26:03] with her parents.
[2:26:05] She was secure.
[2:26:07] Praise the name of And that's the same
[2:26:10] thing now with you.
[2:26:12] Keep in the circles of message
[2:26:13] believers.
[2:26:16] Why would you trust a friend who is not
[2:26:18] not a believer
[2:26:20] and then they get you into things which
[2:26:22] are not right.
[2:26:25] Praise the name of see that you don't
[2:26:27] allow the devil
[2:26:29] to take you aside
[2:26:32] and then stifles you there.
[2:26:34] not coming to church,
[2:26:37] you're not participating in the
[2:26:38] activities of the church.
[2:26:40] But there are other things where you are
[2:26:42] very active
[2:26:44] in the things of the king.
[2:26:47] You are not there. Take interest in the
[2:26:49] things of the king.
[2:26:52] That is how you find the favor of God.
[2:26:56] The name of we should not go out and see
[2:26:59] the daughters of the land.
[2:27:02] We live amongst them. We work with them
[2:27:05] but we are of a different world.
[2:27:09] Let us finish with John chapter 17
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; and then verse 11.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; And now I am no more in the world but
[2:27:18] these are in the world and I come to
[2:27:21] thee holy father keep through thy own
[2:27:25] name those whom thou hast given me that
[2:27:28] they may be one as we are one. John
[2:27:32] 17:11
[2:27:54] So he says, "Keep them through thy
[2:27:56] name."
[2:27:59] Praise the name of our Lord and the name
[2:28:01] of the Lord.
[2:28:03] is a strong and mighty tower.
[2:28:07] The righteous run into
[2:28:11] praise the name of when the devil comes
[2:28:14] around
[2:28:16] you find you are completely held up
[2:28:19] somewhere.
[2:28:22] Call upon the name of the Lord.
[2:28:24] Praise the name of God. You know, just
[2:28:26] like when they tell people
[2:28:29] that if you get yourself that you in a
[2:28:31] dangerous point,
[2:28:33] maybe they are robbers or is a rapist.
[2:28:39] They say that you
[2:28:43] that's one of the tricks they say please
[2:28:45] make a noise.
[2:28:50] Call upon the name of the Lord. Praise
[2:28:53] the name of our Lord. You are caught up
[2:28:55] in action you don't understand.
[2:28:58] Call upon the name of the Lord.
[2:29:01] Praise the name of the Lord. And then he
[2:29:03] says in verse 12,
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; "While I was with them in the world, I
[2:29:08] kept them in thy name. Those that thou
[2:29:12] gavest me have kept, and none of them is
[2:29:15] lost, but the son of pition that the
[2:29:18] scripture might be fulfilled.
[2:29:37] So he says we are in the world
[2:29:40] but what keeps us is the name of the
[2:29:43] Lord. But then he says, "And now I come
[2:29:46] to thee, and these things have I I speak
[2:29:51] in the world, that they might have my
[2:29:54] joy fulfilled in themselves.
[2:29:58] [Music]
[2:30:07] Now in the message of his chosen place
[2:30:10] of worship,
[2:30:13] God
[2:30:14] the place he has chosen to worship
[2:30:18] is the place he has blessed his name.
[2:30:22] That's why we are meant to worship God.
[2:30:25] And that place is the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:30:30] and that place is the word of God.
[2:30:33] So you need to be kept by the word of
[2:30:36] God.
[2:30:38] Hold yourself to the word of God. Let
[2:30:40] the word of God be so dear to you.
[2:30:44] The word says this. It doesn't matter
[2:30:47] how foolish it may be according to the
[2:30:48] world.
[2:30:51] That's your protection.
[2:30:53] Praise the name of do what the word of
[2:30:56] God saying.
[2:30:58] It may be an old kind of way.
[2:31:03] dressing, putting on long dresses.
[2:31:05] I say that's like an old woman,
[2:31:08] but that's the way of the Lord. It's
[2:31:11] your protection.
[2:31:13] Be obedient to the word of God.
[2:31:16] Put on good dresses.
[2:31:19] Not only put on good dresses when you're
[2:31:22] coming to church, even at your place of
[2:31:24] work.
[2:31:26] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:31:29] In some of those urban places,
[2:31:32] when you go to the places during
[2:31:34] weekdays,
[2:31:39] the sisters have a particular dress for
[2:31:41] work,
[2:31:45] tight things, be fashionable.
[2:31:50] Now that's work. I have clothes for
[2:31:53] church also.
[2:31:56] So you conduct different
[2:31:59] When you at work, you behave like the
[2:32:02] daughters of the land.
[2:32:04] When you at church, you want to pretend
[2:32:07] to be a daughter of God.
[2:32:09] You need to be changed.
[2:32:12] Praise the name of the Lord. You need to
[2:32:14] be a daughter of God
[2:32:16] filled with the Holy Spirit. When I'm at
[2:32:19] work, I'm not as the daughters of the
[2:32:21] Lord,
[2:32:23] but I'm the daughter of God. until when
[2:32:26] they will look at me, they will look at
[2:32:28] me as a different person.
[2:32:31] Praise the name of our Lord. Respectful.
[2:32:35] Even men know
[2:32:37] when they look at your conduct. They are
[2:32:40] going to respect you. They not come with
[2:32:43] funny funny words.
[2:32:45] They see you conduct yourself
[2:32:47] respectively.
[2:32:48] They come with respect.
[2:32:50] Excuse me madam. But now if you are the
[2:32:53] one who likes to dressing like a
[2:32:55] prostitute,
[2:32:57] [Music]
[2:32:59] they will come and just start doing
[2:33:01] funny things around you because there's
[2:33:03] a funny spirit on you.
[2:33:06] There's a funny spirit on them and they
[2:33:09] want to match.
[2:33:13] So don't put on dresses of a hallot
[2:33:17] because that's what the Bible says dress
[2:33:19] of a hallot. Those
[2:33:23] are daughters of the land.
[2:33:26] But we are daughters of God. We are
[2:33:28] children of God. We shouldn't be like
[2:33:31] the world.
[2:33:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[2:33:35] verse 14, he says, I have given them thy
[2:33:38] word and the world has hated them.
[2:33:42] Because they are not of the word. Even
[2:33:46] as I'm not of the world,
[2:33:48] I pray not that you should take them out
[2:33:51] of the world.
[2:33:54] Your place of work,
[2:33:59] you stop going to work. Your neighbor
[2:34:01] would stop being there.
[2:34:03] We have something better
[2:34:06] which protects us and that something
[2:34:08] better which protects us
[2:34:11] is within us. Praise the name of God. So
[2:34:14] he says, I pray that you don't take them
[2:34:16] out,
[2:34:18] but that you should keep them
[2:34:22] from evil. Praise the name of our
[2:34:25] protection
[2:34:27] is the word of God. Cherish the word of
[2:34:29] God
[2:34:31] about the word of God. Tell your friends
[2:34:35] who are changing colleagues at place of
[2:34:36] work.
[2:34:40] day is going with a driver. The other
[2:34:43] day is going with office.
[2:34:45] The other day he's going with a compound
[2:34:47] clean
[2:34:49] of the day sleeping with the boss
[2:34:53] is going with the treasure.
[2:34:57] Tell them it is evil.
[2:34:59] Praise the name of our Lord. Tell them
[2:35:01] they destroying themselves
[2:35:03] and tell them you a daughter of God
[2:35:06] and God also wants them to be delivered.
[2:35:14] You know when I said
[2:35:17] you are the light there.
[2:35:19] Let your light so shine
[2:35:23] not hiding it under the bush.
[2:35:28] They should never
[2:35:33] put your light in the bush. Put it on a
[2:35:36] lamp stand.
[2:35:38] Let them know
[2:35:39] The thought of God, the thought of the
[2:35:42] land.
[2:35:43] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[2:35:45] know some of these men
[2:35:48] after using this one, they go and
[2:35:50] broadcast.
[2:35:52] [Music]
[2:35:54] I finished that one. Even the other one
[2:35:56] I finished.
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; And now you want to be part of the line.
[2:36:03] Don't be a mistress
[2:36:05] me.
[2:36:12] No, don't be that. You a daughter of
[2:36:15] God. The daughters of land don't care
[2:36:19] like the other woman at the well.
[2:36:23] Where is your husband?
[2:36:25] I don't have. Then Jesus said, you've
[2:36:29] had many.
[2:36:32] Even the one you have is not yours. You
[2:36:34] are not worth that.
[2:36:38] And don't open up yourself to that.
[2:36:43] Don't allow yourself to get into that
[2:36:46] bottomless pit.
[2:36:49] It's a bottomless pit.
[2:36:52] It keeps you taking you farther.
[2:36:56] Don't allow it. Don't open those doors.
[2:37:00] Praise the name of the Lord. Don't do
[2:37:02] that.
[2:37:04] Just reject what the way the world does
[2:37:06] their thing.
[2:37:08] stand out as a daughter of God.
[2:37:11] Say, "Lord, I'm going to live faithful
[2:37:13] to you.
[2:37:16] I'm going to be a virgin of your word.
[2:37:19] Not defiled in my heart."
[2:37:22] And then there are those, of course,
[2:37:24] they will put on long clothes,
[2:37:26] but the spirits in them,
[2:37:29] they grumble when they put on long
[2:37:31] dresses.
[2:37:34] [Music]
[2:37:40] No, don't do that. It's for your safety.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; And you receive it with joy.
[2:37:46] The Bible says his word is not grievious
[2:37:51] to us.
[2:37:54] Let it bring joy
[2:37:57] and that's your protection.
[2:37:59] Praise the name of God. We live among
[2:38:02] daughters of the lord.
[2:38:04] We should not behave like the daughters
[2:38:06] of the land.
[2:38:08] And as a son of God,
[2:38:11] be respectful.
[2:38:13] Why would you want to exploit another
[2:38:14] person?
[2:38:16] Why would you want do things which are
[2:38:18] not right?
[2:38:20] Live upright before the Lord.
[2:38:23] Praise the name of May God bless you.
[2:38:26] Amen.
[2:38:29] Amen.
[2:38:33] Let us sing that song. When he reached
[2:38:36] down his heart for me. Praise the name
[2:38:38] of our Lord. And I believe the Lord has
[2:38:40] been reaching down.
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; You know when a message like this comes,
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; it is grace.
[2:38:48] Praise the name of our Lord. Like when
[2:38:50] pastor preached,
[2:38:53] praise the name of our lord now and
[2:38:55] prophetic
[2:38:57] in season and out of season.
[2:39:01] Every message has significance.
[2:39:04] Maybe there is a trap which was late for
[2:39:06] you. Maybe there is a trap which was
[2:39:08] late for you.
[2:39:11] Maybe there is a challenge which is
[2:39:12] coming.
[2:39:14] Every message has relevance.
[2:39:17] Just take it. Lord,
[2:39:19] help me out of that mess.
[2:39:21] And if God has helped you, desire God
[2:39:25] help another person.
[2:39:27] Maybe your daughters, maybe your
[2:39:29] sisters,
[2:39:31] maybe your friends
[2:39:33] or your sons or your brothers. Say,
[2:39:37] Lord, help us deliver us. Amen.
[2:39:43] [Applause]
[2:39:45] When he rained
[2:39:47] down his heart
[2:39:51] for me
[2:39:55] when he reached
[2:39:59] down his heart
[2:40:02] for me.
[2:40:05] [Music]
[2:40:07] I was lost
[2:40:10] and undone.
[2:40:14] with our gold
[2:40:18] or his son
[2:40:21] when he reach
[2:40:25] down his hand
[2:40:28] for me. W for me.
[2:40:34] [Music]
[2:40:36] Once my soul
[2:40:39] was a stray
[2:40:43] from the
[2:40:47] many way
[2:40:50] and was ra
[2:40:58] as could be.
[2:41:04] Oh, by my savior
[2:41:09] above,
[2:41:12] give me peace,
[2:41:16] joy, and love.
[2:41:19] Oh, when he reach
[2:41:23] down his hand
[2:41:27] for me.
[2:41:30] Oh,
[2:41:33] oh yes. When he reaches,
[2:41:37] oh doubt is high

[2:46:26] precious heavenly father, king of glory,
[2:46:31] we appreciate you. We glorify you. We
[2:46:34] magnify you, Lord. We praise your name.
[2:46:37] We want to thank you heavenly father.
[2:46:40] Each time your word comes and speaks to
[2:46:42] us oh heavenly father it comes to
[2:46:45] instruct us lord as it is written oh
[2:46:48] father that all scripture is given for
[2:46:52] inspiration lord. Sometimes father you
[2:46:55] desire to correct us. Sometimes he
[2:46:58] father you desire to instruct us. And
[2:47:01] lord to them that you love you said you
[2:47:04] rebuke and trusted. Father, we have been
[2:47:07] told this morning, Lord, how, oh king of
[2:47:10] glory, they are daughters of the land
[2:47:13] and how the sons of God should only
[2:47:17] marry from their kind. Lord, we have
[2:47:20] been told this morning, Lord, how, King
[2:47:23] of glory, we should stay pure, how, oh
[2:47:27] king of glory, we can keep, oh, heavenly
[2:47:30] father, from wrong influences, Lord.
[2:47:33] Father, like any mortal man, Lord, we
[2:47:37] walk and live in this world. Like your
[2:47:40] scriptures say, we are in this world,
[2:47:42] but we are not of this world. Father,
[2:47:45] our prayer, King of glory, is that you
[2:47:48] can help us, Father, to overcome, Lord,
[2:47:51] each day, oh king of glory, you have put
[2:47:54] us in this world because you believe, oh
[2:47:58] heavenly father, that we are your royal
[2:48:01] seed. You have given us an overcoming
[2:48:04] power. Power to overcome every
[2:48:07] circumstance. Oh king of glory. Power
[2:48:10] Lord to overcome the flesh. Power to
[2:48:14] overcome sin. Power to overcome lust of
[2:48:17] the eye. Power to overcome the pride of
[2:48:20] life. King of glory. We are so thankful
[2:48:24] because each and every day we come in
[2:48:26] your presence. Lord, you re-energize us
[2:48:29] with your word. Father, we want to
[2:48:31] commit ourselves. Oh king of glory,
[2:48:33] Lord, perhaps Lord, your word has come
[2:48:36] to instruct us. Oh heavenly father
[2:48:39] teaching us the way. Oh king of glory
[2:48:41] Lord God in which we should walk. Oh
[2:48:44] heavenly father appreciating oh king of
[2:48:47] glory the oldtime way. Oh heavenly
[2:48:50] father we pray. Oh king of glory Lord
[2:48:52] God that we may not walk oh heavenly
[2:48:55] father Lord God after the lusts of our
[2:48:58] flesh. Oh Lord we may not walk oh king
[2:49:01] of glory after the things that please
[2:49:03] our eyes. Oh Lord, we may not walk. Oh
[2:49:06] heavenly father, after the way we feel,
[2:49:09] oh king of glory, because you say even
[2:49:12] from out of the heart proceeds all
[2:49:14] issues of life, father may our hearts be
[2:49:18] guarded. Oh Lord, like Samson, oh king
[2:49:21] of glory, Lord God, he gave all his
[2:49:24] strength, oh father, to thee, but his
[2:49:27] heart he gave unto a woman. Father, we
[2:49:30] do not want to be like that kind of
[2:49:33] person this afternoon, Lord. We want to
[2:49:35] give our all to you, Lord. We want to
[2:49:38] give our hearts fully to thee, Lord,
[2:49:40] that you can be able to instruct us,
[2:49:42] Lord, even as young people, Lord,
[2:49:45] instructing, oh heavenly father, in the
[2:49:48] way of marriage, oh king of glory,
[2:49:50] because oh heavenly father, we learn, oh
[2:49:53] Lord, that this is the only way the
[2:49:55] church can be broken. If the enemy can
[2:49:58] destroy the marriages, if the enemy can
[2:50:02] come in to destroy families that he will
[2:50:06] be able to destroy the church. But
[2:50:08] father, we want to thank you for your
[2:50:10] love. Father, it endures forever.
[2:50:13] Father, we want to thank you for your
[2:50:15] grace each and every day that give us
[2:50:17] that gives us power to overcome. Oh king
[2:50:20] of glory, that gives us power, heavenly
[2:50:22] father, against every w of the enemy. Oh
[2:50:26] Lord, you said in your word, oh Lord,
[2:50:29] that
[2:50:30] that the church is a type, marriage is a
[2:50:34] type of Christ and the church. And
[2:50:36] father, that is why Lord, you have given
[2:50:39] us the principles this morning, Lord,
[2:50:41] never to defile ourselves, Lord, that
[2:50:44] even as a spiritual church or king of
[2:50:47] glory, Lord, you desire that bride that
[2:50:50] is without spot or wrinkle. You desire
[2:50:53] that bride that is adorned, oh heavenly
[2:50:56] father, with a gown of righteousness.
[2:50:59] You desire that bride, oh heavenly
[2:51:01] father, that washes herself by the
[2:51:05] washing waters of the one. You desire,
[2:51:08] heavenly father, that we can be that
[2:51:10] bride, oh king of glory, that can put
[2:51:13] all the guilty stains back under the
[2:51:15] blood. Father give us the grace or king
[2:51:18] of glory that as we walk in this world
[2:51:21] Lord we may not be of the world heavenly
[2:51:23] father and as we make our choices Lord
[2:51:27] sometimes in marriage Lord sometimes for
[2:51:30] our children oh king of glory be
[2:51:32] gracious heavenly father that we come
[2:51:35] back to the mind of the word that we may
[2:51:38] inquire of thee oh lord that we may not
[2:51:40] do things oh father like the world but
[2:51:43] we may fashion after the after thy word.
[2:51:46] Oh Lord, may you help us, oh king of
[2:51:49] glory, forgive us, Lord, as your mercies
[2:51:52] are new every morning. Lord, if we have
[2:51:55] walked far away, Lord, if we have made
[2:51:58] bad decisions, Lord, may you give us the
[2:52:01] grace, oh heavenly father, may your
[2:52:03] unconditional love be poured out, oh
[2:52:05] heavenly father, that we may be able, oh
[2:52:08] Lord, as a body, oh king of glory, to
[2:52:11] rectify, oh heavenly father, to make
[2:52:14] amens, oh king of glory, lord, being
[2:52:17] guided by the word, oh lord, change our

[2:52:25] minds, Lord, to have a renewal of our
[2:52:28] minds, Lord, to think like you, heavenly
[2:52:30] father, to have a thinking man's filter,
[2:52:33] oh God, that everything that we do, oh
[2:52:36] Lord, we may receive it under the word.
[2:52:39] every decision that we make, oh heavenly
[2:52:42] father, we may look through the lens of
[2:52:45] the word, oh Lord, and be guided, oh
