[41:16] yes that teaches and establishes
[41:21] the same is the same Ministry that has
[41:24] made me who I am today
[41:27] amen so I I just have something small
[41:34] as a brick that I can add on to the
[41:37] building
[41:38] is I cannot put on those big shoes

[41:49] Pastor Steven
[41:51] Universe who have given me the grace and
[41:54] opportunity to stand before you here

[42:05] so many diversions
[42:10] people leaving the path
[42:13] you remember that vision of brother

[42:39] because many are falling off
[42:42] many are departing from this way of
[42:44] Faith
[42:45] many are taking of the tree of knowledge
[42:51] seeking for knowledge
[42:55] encyclopedias and books
[42:57] to try to dispute the message did I
[43:01] dispute the revealed word
[43:03] dispute the truth that is before our
[43:05] eyes
[43:07] but the Cry of the spirit is
[43:14] and I want to just share some few things
[43:17] here
[43:18] just to help us in our everyday
[43:21] Christian Living
[43:23] I mean I'm not going to bring a big
[43:27] Doctrine or teachings
[43:30] because I know you're well established
[43:32] in that
[43:34] one will come but I'm just going to
[43:36] bring something small that can help us
[43:40] in our everyday lives
[43:44] let's just say a word of prayer
[43:47] dear gracious Lord and Savior Jesus
[43:50] Christ
[43:51] you know you are here this morning
[43:54] I feel your presence I pray Lord Jesus
[43:58] but you take me out of the way and for
[44:02] this one or two hours
[44:07] you open my mouth open the mouth of mine
[44:15] and take us through your words
[44:20] of everyone here that we may be able to
[44:24] hear from you hear from the spirit that
[44:27] we may be blessed I know you've done it
[44:30] father you performed your words thank
[44:34] you Lord
[44:36] in Your Righteous Name Lord Jesus Christ
[44:45] foreign
[45:12] it says here blessed is the man whose
[45:15] strength is in thee in whose heart are
[45:18] the ways of them
[45:35] ah
[45:37] is that what it says blessed is the man
[45:39] whose strength is in thee
[45:46] are the ways of them
[45:57] all passing through the valley of baka
[46:00] make it a whale
[46:08] the rain also filled the pools
[46:13] foreign
[46:23] [Music]
[46:40] Job 14 verse 1.
[46:54] Job 14 1.
[46:57] take another finger to proverbs 5.
[47:03] Job 14 1 says man that is born of a
[47:05] woman is of few days and full of trouble
[47:17] foreign
[47:25] he says drink Waters out of thine own
[47:28] system and running Waters out of thine
[47:32] own well
[47:41] let thy fountains be this past abroad
[47:44] and rivers of waters in the streets
[47:55] let them be only thine own are not
[47:59] strangers with thee foreign
[48:33] blessed is that man
[48:35] whose strength is in Hope
[48:39] then he says passing through the valley
[48:43] of baka
[48:46] makes it a well that you follow Cuba and
[48:50] Salon
[48:50] then he says they go from strength to
[48:54] strength
[48:56] after doing what going through the
[49:00] valley of baka
[49:02] you have made a well
[49:07] and in Proverbs Solomon says
[49:11] drink Waters out of thine own system
[49:16] and running Waters out of thine own well
[49:41] in this life of troubles
[49:45] because the job has told us
[49:49] man that is born of a woman
[49:52] is a few days
[49:55] and full of words full of troubles
[50:22] who going through those short days
[51:08] you go from strength to strength
[51:13] Amina we don't stay put in one place
[51:20] Hallelujah and in Proverbs he's telling
[51:23] us here
[51:24] bring waters out of thine Waters
[51:29] and running Waters out of thy own well
[51:34] so how will you drink the waters if
[51:38] you've not dug the world
[51:41] foreign
[52:09] because the scripture cannot be broken
[52:14] I need the power connectivity first
[52:19] going down
[52:23] yes sir at the beginning part of it all
[52:26] right
[52:27] David says here
[52:30] blessed is the man whose strength is
[52:37] so where does the starting point is what
[52:41] is the starting point
[52:44] the starting point is that your strength
[52:49] is in God
[52:52] that's the beginning Point not in your
[52:55] own strength not in anything else
[53:00] but in the Lord
[53:03] in the message all the days of our life
[53:10] see that that's just the nature of man
[53:12] 219
[53:14] he wants his own way
[53:16] and God did not make man to desire his
[53:20] own way
[53:23] God made man to depend on him
[53:30] so what is the beginning point of it is
[53:34] that we depend on God
[53:39] he says to forsake his way
[53:42] is to crucify his way
[53:46] and we get lost
[53:48] so man is to depend on God
[53:53] spiritually
[53:55] physically
[53:56] in all aspects of Our Lives the
[54:00] beginning points
[54:02] is dependency
[54:09] foreign
[54:20] by the time God is calling
[54:23] Adam
[54:25] where are you I've gotten a clothing for
[54:29] you
[54:30] Adam already gone ahead and hidden
[54:33] himself
[54:34] and behind the Fig leaves
[54:37] he had already done his own fig leaves
[54:42] says God wants us to depend on him
[54:49] foreign
[55:31] he does not pass through the valley
[55:33] and just looks at it like that he says
[55:37] the valley is dry up
[55:40] the valley is difficult
[55:42] the valley has no way out for me
[55:48] goes ahead and starts to dig a while
[55:53] the word
[55:55] is mentioned once in the Bible
[55:58] if you read in the Bible you will not
[56:02] say it write that one apart from Psalms
[56:04] 84.
[56:06] foreign
[56:58] so in this life we are living in
[57:01] the valley of weapons is the value of
[57:05] the shadow of
[57:08] deaths
[57:12] but what is God telling us
[57:15] blessed is that man
[57:17] who passing through it
[57:21] makes it a well yeah
[57:26] he is not going to say oh the the valley
[57:30] that is
[57:31] so dry up I cannot do anything in it is
[57:49] I like the way the Bible says
[57:52] he says passing through the value
[57:57] foreign
[58:05] [Music]
[58:08] who going through the valley of baka
[58:12] searched for a well yeah and he found it
[58:17] somewhere
[58:19] the Bible says passing through this
[58:23] Valley
[58:24] make it
[58:30] there's an element there
[58:33] make it a well
[58:36] um
[58:46] there is an effort from us
[58:52] an effort from us
[58:54] yes we have to do something
[58:58] I know the days are short I know the
[59:02] days are full of trouble
[59:04] but what are you doing about it
[59:12] Psalms 90 tells us
[59:14] the days are few
[59:18] Ecclesiastes 2 23.
[59:21] 517 these are scriptures you read from
[59:24] home
[59:25] he says the days are full of troubles
[59:29] the life of few days
[59:32] I have plenty of troubles
[59:35] many challenges
[59:39] but what do we do about it
[59:45] the conclusion of the matter is that
[59:48] the road of life
[59:51] is not a simple Road
[59:55] neither is it an easy Road
[1:00:00] David is referring it to it as a valley
[1:00:03] of weapons
[1:00:06] morning for everything
[1:00:09] but it takes us
[1:00:12] to do something about it
[1:00:19] the message the world is falling apart
[1:00:23] am says a statement like this is
[1:00:28] okay
[1:00:31] he says we want just we want everything
[1:00:35] just according to end up with
[1:00:38] everything
[1:00:41] so we can take it easy
[1:00:46] and retire
[1:00:49] and take life easy
[1:00:52] he says life isn't intended to be easy
[1:01:06] isn't intended to be easy
[1:01:10] life is a struggle
[1:01:15] Amina Amina yes sir anything that's got
[1:01:19] in life
[1:01:26] so if life is a struggle
[1:01:30] what are you doing about it
[1:01:33] David has told you the first thing put
[1:01:38] your dependence in God
[1:01:40] that's the beginning bit of it then when
[1:01:44] you put your dependence on God
[1:01:46] then God to make the world
[1:01:52] go to start digging the words in life
[1:01:55] go to start scratching the ground
[1:01:59] big
[1:02:01] adventure get water here
[1:02:04] the adventure get water therefore get
[1:02:08] water in the other place but don't sit
[1:02:11] still
[1:02:16] glory be to God
[1:02:18] I mean he says life is not intended to
[1:02:21] be easy
[1:02:25] that it's not an easy road
[1:02:28] but he is there at your back
[1:02:36] that you depend on him
[1:02:40] but what are you doing about it
[1:02:46] he says look at the trees how they
[1:02:49] struggle according to other guys look at
[1:02:52] everything that's God's life
[1:02:56] and when when we try to get some kind of
[1:03:00] a system
[1:03:03] that takes it easy
[1:03:07] then we are wrong
[1:03:11] we try to make it easy for people
[1:03:13] together
[1:03:15] no brother it's just easy don't need to
[1:03:18] struggle with that
[1:03:24] try to make it look easy
[1:03:29] it's never easy
[1:03:33] the conclusion of it is
[1:03:48] us out of them
[1:03:52] Amina
[1:03:54] that is the conclusion of it the
[1:03:57] troubles will be there the problems
[1:04:07] foreign
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:55] he says the gift is free
[1:04:58] now he's talking of Salvation
[1:05:00] the gift is free that is true
[1:05:04] but you've got two
[1:05:12] questions
[1:05:15] even salvation is freely give an answer
[1:05:19] but you've got to do something about it
[1:05:23] you've got to believe it is
[1:05:30] foreign
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:23] you will know how to care foreign
[1:06:28] [Music]
[1:06:37] oh glory be to God blessed is that man
[1:06:41] passing through the valley of baka every
[1:06:44] time
[1:06:44] he makes the world
[1:06:47] he don't sit there and say I don't know
[1:06:51] how to feed the cattle yeah I don't know
[1:06:54] how the ship will bring water
[1:06:58] Lord why have you brought me together
[1:07:04] and here I'm dying in the wilderness
[1:07:08] God would have said Abraham what's your
[1:07:12] problem
[1:07:14] foreign
[1:07:54] [Applause]
[1:08:03] glory be to God and when you hit the
[1:08:07] water brother you will be able to drink
[1:08:10] water out of your own sister
[1:08:13] water out of your own well
[1:08:18] and we shall seed your cows happy Moon
[1:08:22] the ship is very healthy moving around
[1:08:26] the crops are doing very well
[1:08:29] because there is water
[1:08:33] nature teaches us these things
[1:08:38] glory be to God
[1:08:40] hallelujah hallelujah when God put Adam
[1:08:43] in the Garden of Eden
[1:08:46] in Genesis chapter 2 verse 15.
[1:08:53] listen what the Bible says
[1:08:57] and the Lord God took the man
[1:09:00] and put him into the Garden of Eden
[1:09:03] to dress it I remember and to keep it
[1:09:09] it did not put him in the garden
[1:09:11] that all have given you now
[1:09:15] keep eating it
[1:09:17] eat every food
[1:09:20] enjoy as you march as you want to
[1:09:25] that is good that is one aspect of it
[1:09:29] but there's a responsibility
[1:09:32] to dress it
[1:09:35] to prune it
[1:09:37] vines that are growing wildly like this
[1:09:41] you cut them down
[1:09:43] there's a lot of weeds
[1:09:46] you dig around it it needs water you
[1:09:51] pour water
[1:09:52] you do something
[1:09:54] that the fruits of the trees will be
[1:09:58] able to feed you
[1:09:59] [Applause]
[1:10:05] glory be to God yes sir well so Adam
[1:10:10] had to do something
[1:10:21] glory be to God so blessed is that man
[1:10:24] who digs the world and Solomon adds to
[1:10:28] read and says
[1:10:30] and it brings from his own wealth yeah
[1:10:37] in Genesis chapter 20.
[1:10:42] I'll try to rush through
[1:10:48] 20 verse 1 says
[1:10:51] the South Country and dwelled between
[1:10:54] Kadesh and should and Sir John Deen yeah
[1:11:09] and we read we jumped to 21 to 24
[1:11:14] from home
[1:11:17] and Abraham said I will swear
[1:11:21] verse chapter 21 verse 4.
[1:11:31] and Abraham repeated because of a well
[1:11:34] of water which abimelech servants had
[1:11:37] violently
[1:11:39] taken away
[1:11:49] said I want not who have done this thing
[1:11:52] neither this that would tell me neither
[1:11:55] yet had eye of it but today
[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:08] I've just tried to cut just this portion
[1:12:11] of scriptures
[1:12:19] what am I going to show here
[1:12:22] God showing us here
[1:12:25] Abraham dwelled in the valley of Guerra
[1:12:31] that belongs
[1:12:34] and it was there that he settled
[1:12:39] and what did Abraham do
[1:12:42] he dug a well for his cattle yes
[1:12:47] and when he dug the well
[1:12:51] the Servants of
[1:12:53] abimelechase who did not want to dig
[1:12:56] their own Wells
[1:12:59] who wanted to benefit from some other
[1:13:02] person as well
[1:13:05] who wanted to go and draw from the world
[1:13:08] that Abraham's servants
[1:13:14] they said we will we need water for our
[1:13:17] cattle also according to anything
[1:13:20] and the Servants of Abraham says
[1:13:24] this world without for our for our
[1:13:27] culture
[1:13:29] they said no would they say this is in
[1:13:32] our land here
[1:13:34] so it brought a bit of friction
[1:13:38] and that's it takes us to what we've
[1:13:41] been reading there electricity so
[1:13:43] Abraham and and the ability
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:07] to continue to use his own words
[1:14:13] and feed his own cattle and faith is on
[1:14:17] sheep so the challenge that had come in
[1:14:23] challenge
[1:14:24] had wanted to come and steal that well
[1:14:28] and that is the work of the thief
[1:14:32] according to John 10 10.
[1:14:35] when Jesus says
[1:14:46] so he wanted to take that that well so
[1:14:50] the pattern was laid there um
[1:14:54] Abraham to settle in the in the valley
[1:14:57] of Gerard
[1:14:59] he had to dig up Wells of water
[1:15:04] in this Valley of the shadow of death
[1:15:09] he could keep well
[1:15:13] so that his cattle should have water
[1:15:17] so that's his flock should should have
[1:15:20] water
[1:15:23] the same we see in in John chapter four
[1:15:28] when Jesus goes and sits at that well of
[1:15:32] psycha yes
[1:15:35] that woman said
[1:15:37] this is Jacob's Well
[1:15:42] and that is confirmed in the Old
[1:15:44] Testament in Genesis chapter 33.
[1:15:48] you read the scriptures
[1:15:57] Isaac also went ahead and dubbed well
[1:16:03] what is the pattern there
[1:16:05] life is a few days
[1:16:09] is of troubles we live in a valley of
[1:16:13] shadow of death
[1:16:18] very right
[1:16:20] but what do you do about it
[1:16:23] go ahead and make words
[1:16:29] of water
[1:16:31] that will be able to
[1:16:35] to keep you well
[1:16:38] that will be able to sustain you
[1:16:41] that will be able to keep you going
[1:16:43] myself
[1:16:46] in second somewhere
[1:16:48] chapter 23 here
[1:16:54] we see here David
[1:16:56] longing for the water of the wet Waters
[1:17:00] of him
[1:17:05] verse 14.
[1:17:12] and David was in on hold on
[1:17:15] the girls then in Bethlehem
[1:17:25] [Applause]
[1:17:41] and the three Mighty Men break through
[1:17:44] the host of the Philistines and Brew
[1:17:46] water out of the well of Bethlehem that
[1:17:49] was by the gate and took it and brought
[1:17:51] it to David
[1:17:57] um
[1:18:07] nevertheless would not drink thereof but
[1:18:10] powered it out unto the Lord as an
[1:18:12] offering
[1:18:26] but David longed for the
[1:18:30] day
[1:18:32] of Bethany yeah
[1:18:39] David in all his frustration
[1:18:44] back and forth
[1:18:48] this is in a message
[1:18:52] he says all this hot day
[1:18:56] oh it is so hot
[1:18:59] it's all might come from this way
[1:19:02] the Philistines from this way
[1:19:05] around everywhere and here we are
[1:19:08] sitting in the mouth of a cave
[1:19:10] and he had the anointing oil on me
[1:19:14] how can it be how can it be oh I wish I
[1:19:19] had a drink
[1:19:21] then his mind goes
[1:19:25] way down by the gates of the Bethlehem
[1:19:30] there was aware
[1:19:33] and that's about the line I wanted
[1:19:37] his mind went back way up
[1:19:40] to that world he says there just was no
[1:19:46] water like that water come out here
[1:19:51] Palestine had some bad water
[1:19:55] they have they have evil Waters
[1:19:58] they have even to block water fever and
[1:20:02] stuff in them
[1:20:04] and a lot of its alkaline water which
[1:20:07] would kill you now imagine
[1:20:10] Bethlehem is the water seat of the
[1:20:12] continues and continues
[1:20:15] so he says he cried for the water from
[1:20:18] where according
[1:20:21] to him
[1:20:26] there was a well
[1:20:28] that had been dugging
[1:20:33] and he was so sure that this water from
[1:20:37] this world is unpolluted it will do him
[1:20:42] God
[1:20:46] amen my brother my sister
[1:20:49] what are you doing about it
[1:20:54] and start digging the wells
[1:20:59] I'm not telling you to pick Spades now
[1:21:05] and you start going in physical life I'm
[1:21:08] going to dig away
[1:21:13] it's not digging going to start digging
[1:21:16] physical world
[1:21:26] we are going to get it better
[1:21:31] so David longed for that water of
[1:21:33] Bethlehem
[1:21:37] that Samaritan woman in John chapter
[1:21:39] four
[1:21:41] sat by that well
[1:21:44] and Jesus when he came yes he went to
[1:21:49] the same way
[1:21:50] and he also SATs I said woman give me
[1:21:55] some water water from where water from
[1:21:59] that way yo
[1:22:02] bring waters from your own world
[1:22:07] and he knew that word
[1:22:10] was done by the Patriots
[1:22:17] so he wanted to drink that same water
[1:22:19] Diego
[1:22:25] in Ecclesiastes he says something like
[1:22:28] this
[1:22:35] Ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse 10.
[1:22:39] he says whatsoever by hand findeth to do
[1:22:46] um
[1:22:49] do it with thy might go
[1:22:56] for there is no work
[1:22:58] no device
[1:23:01] no knowledge
[1:23:08] where that will go West Georgia
[1:23:12] so when do you have the opportunity to
[1:23:15] do it
[1:23:17] that's the question I'm trying to answer
[1:23:19] now here
[1:23:22] when do we dig the wells
[1:23:25] whatsoever thy hand findeth today
[1:23:30] he says do it with thy might
[1:23:37] because when you go down in the graves
[1:23:41] there's no work
[1:23:44] no knowledge
[1:23:46] no wisdom no nothing too
[1:23:54] all that will have ceased when is the
[1:23:58] opportunity
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:01] we're not still walking this Valley of
[1:24:04] the shadow of death
[1:24:07] you know
[1:24:09] when we're still walking this time
[1:24:12] get the opportunity
[1:24:14] and do it
[1:24:17] verse 11 continues and he says
[1:24:20] I returned and I saw Under the Sun
[1:24:25] the rest is not to the Swift
[1:24:30] not the battle to the strong Empire
[1:24:35] [Music]
[1:24:37] neither bread to the wise foreign
[1:25:08] foreign
[1:25:12] mixed yourself up Let me read it slowly
[1:25:16] he says I returned and so under the sun
[1:26:08] that for me I don't have understanding
[1:26:13] foreign
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:32] foreign
[1:26:34] [Music]
[1:26:37] [Applause]
[1:27:02] [Applause]
[1:27:15] [Applause]
[1:27:33] there is an opportunity foreign
[1:27:41] [Applause]
[1:27:42] so we all have opportunities
[1:27:53] Amina Amina say no to Satan standing
[1:27:56] commanding do not take that which God
[1:27:59] has given me
[1:28:00] now
[1:28:02] [Applause]
[1:28:04] has been given to us
[1:28:08] the Ecclesiastes says
[1:28:11] [Applause]
[1:28:15] do it with your mind I like the way he
[1:28:18] says
[1:28:24] what does finding means

[1:29:55] oh glory be to God
[1:30:00] we need to look at it we mean search for
[1:30:03] all these things
[1:30:07] let me read the quote here what brother
[1:30:09] Branham says in the message proving his
[1:30:12] word
[1:30:16] he says but remember he keeps all of his
[1:30:19] promises of blessings
[1:30:24] as well as he does his castings
[1:30:31] the same way he remembers the curses
[1:30:35] it's the same way he remembers the
[1:30:37] blessings
[1:30:40] so because they eat their roof welcome
[1:30:44] back that day they died
[1:30:47] and he proves it to you
[1:30:50] that they do die
[1:30:52] that they they eat their roles

[1:31:17] about his blessings

[1:39:51] [Applause]
[1:39:57] [Applause]
[1:40:00] shall take place
[1:40:05] we believe it in the spiritual
[1:40:08] but we fear in the physicals yeah
[1:40:15] even if you buy a Jet Plane tomorrow
[1:40:18] I will not fear
[1:40:23] everything
[1:40:25] I'm not I'm now not saying
[1:40:28] we got the audition way
[1:40:34] the pressure the burden
[1:40:38] is for the wealth
[1:40:41] instead of Christ in them
[1:40:44] they'll say that I'm rich
[1:40:48] not your naked miserable wretched and
[1:40:51] blind
[1:40:56] Amina
[1:40:58] so I'm not saying you're going that to
[1:40:59] extreme
[1:41:03] if you live for 10 million years
[1:41:08] the blessings of God

[1:41:15] blessings left for you
[1:41:19] oh he is
[1:41:28] glory to his name when you plant
[1:41:32] yourself in him
[1:41:34] by this Fountain it's like the Traders
[1:41:37] planted by the rivers of water

[1:42:05] it
[1:42:08] so much I don't need it
[1:42:12] but you can never exhaust God
[1:42:15] so if you say God that I don't need it
[1:42:18] enough
[1:42:20] then be contented
[1:42:23] and settle down
[1:42:26] but if you are not contented
