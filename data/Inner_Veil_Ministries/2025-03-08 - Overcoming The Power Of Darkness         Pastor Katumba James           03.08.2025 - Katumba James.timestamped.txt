[40:26] &gt;&gt; Father, how we thank you this morning,
[40:30] the grace that you've given unto us,
[40:31] Father,
[40:33] that Lord, we can come into your
[40:35] presence, Lord.
[40:37] We magnify your holy name. And we thank
[40:40] thee, Father, that we've come to present
[40:43] ourselves
[40:45] before your throne of grace and mercy.
[40:49] And we pray that father your mercies may
[40:51] be enough for every one of us.
[40:55] Regardless of how somebody strayed away,
[41:00] may it be sufficient to draw them back
[41:01] into your presence
[41:04] that Lord you may bless us Lord
[41:07] being with us the whole day. Father
[41:10] speaking to us, encouraging us,
[41:14] forgiving us, delivering us and
[41:17] restoring us back. Father,
[41:20] in that true fellowship with you, Lord,
[41:23] heal the sick in our midst, Lord. Make
[41:26] yourself known to each and every one of
[41:27] us and have thy own way in our ministry.
[41:32] We want to thank you so much. We pray
[41:34] may have preeminence upon everything
[41:36] that's going to be done today.
[41:39] of your holy name in the name of the
[41:41] Lord Jesus who pray this.
[41:44] Amen. Amen. Bless. You may be seated.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; I greet you in the name of our Lord
[41:51] Jesus Christ.
[41:54] I'm happy to be here in the house of the
[41:55] Lord.
[41:57] The week has been so busy for me
[42:02] from when I've been preaching every day
[42:06] and he has just been the grace of God
[42:09] and I've been going to different places
[42:13] on Wednesday
[42:15] we had a service here
[42:18] then I had an online service again that
[42:20] same day
[42:23] on Thursday I was in Palisa
[42:27] Then on Friday I was in
[42:30] yesterday I was in.
[42:33] Thank God I'm here this morning.
[42:36] Praise the name of our Lord.
[42:39] So it's always just the grace of God.
[42:44] Praise the name of our Lord. Sometimes I
[42:47] always wonder can I move out with those
[42:49] fields?
[42:53] But I'm praying the Lord raise some
[42:54] people.
[42:56] Praise the name of our lord so much
[42:59] engaged in their work
[43:02] and you can't you can't tell them leave
[43:05] your work.
[43:07] Praise the name of our lord but there is
[43:09] a lot of need outside
[43:13] like for the places I was in over the
[43:16] last three days.
[43:18] I was last there in November last year.
[43:24] But this time when I went there,
[43:27] people were really weak,
[43:30] [Music]
[43:32] very weak that you had to go back almost
[43:35] at the beginning.
[43:38] So we just need to keep on praying for
[43:39] one another
[43:41] that the grace of God may continue to
[43:43] work in the whole body of Jesus Christ.
[43:47] There's a brother called Rogers from
[43:49] Canongu.
[43:51] You can raise your hand. Yes. Stand up.
[43:53] You're welcome. Our brother.
[43:56] We're happy to have you around.
[43:59] You may sit back. You may sit back. It's
[44:02] okay. Thank you for being with us.
[44:05] He came all the way from
[44:10] and the zeal of the Lord he has is very
[44:12] interesting.
[44:16] last Sunday, last stand of Friday last
[44:19] week, he called me
[44:22] and then he was meant to come but he was
[44:24] held up by his work
[44:26] and it is strange how we started landing
[44:28] our radio programs.
[44:33] So he he has been listening to them and
[44:35] that's how he knew that there was a
[44:36] church around.
[44:38] So he called me this morning and by 8:00
[44:41] I believe he was around.
[44:44] Praise the name of our Lord. So I
[44:46] welcome our brother to be with us.
[44:49] Praise the name of our Lord. I see
[44:51] brother weekly.
[44:53] You can stand up for recognition.
[44:56] We welcome you. He was with us here
[45:00] about last year and before last year.
[45:04] He was also doing a course at Campal
[45:07] International University Medical School.
[45:10] [Music]
[45:11] Now he works in as a medical doctor I
[45:14] believe.
[45:16] So you're welcome to be with us,
[45:17] brother.
[45:20] And then I see brother Mike, you're also
[45:22] welcome. You've just reached in.
[45:24] Welcome.
[45:26] We're happy to be with you today.
[45:28] And then other visitors coming here for
[45:30] the first time, just raise your hand.
[45:36] I believe we are not so much strangers
[45:40] and I'm very grateful brother
[45:44] that from the time he brought the
[45:45] children for dedication
[45:49] he doesn't leave them back home
[45:52] praise the name of our lord and even
[45:54] others we can pick up the same leaf
[45:58] that you know we can always come with
[46:00] our families to worship the lord
[46:03] Praise the name of the Lord. Our pastor
[46:05] is not around
[46:07] and part of his family.
[46:10] They went to minister in May today.
[46:13] Just keep them in your prayers.
[46:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Then on
[46:19] 24th,
[46:21] that's this month of August,
[46:24] we were meant to have brother Tim,
[46:28] but he's not coming.
[46:30] But instead we have another visiting
[46:31] minister.
[46:34] He's called brother Franklin George.
[46:37] George.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; He comes from Ibadan
[46:41] Ibadan
[46:41] &gt;&gt; in Nigeria.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Nigeria.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; He's going to be with us for the whole
[46:46] month.
[46:49] He's reaching on Saturday.
[46:55] So you can imagine how busy we are going
[46:57] to get to be.
[47:01] Praise the name of our Lord. So next
[47:03] Sunday we'll be preaching in
[47:07] Pastor S's church. I'll be traveling
[47:09] with him there.
[47:12] So pastor will be preaching here on
[47:14] Sunday.
[47:16] Then on Wednesday we'll be going to
[47:20] then from there we take him to Campala.
[47:24] Then he will be at brother Kabasi's
[47:26] church on 15th and 17th.
[47:32] Then from there I'll go to brother
[47:34] Gideon's church in
[47:38] he will come back. Then on Friday that
[47:41] will be 22nd
[47:45] you'll be preaching in
[47:48] brother SA's church and on Friday also
[47:52] that time we shall we would require to
[47:54] go and be with that service in Kacha
[47:59] Friday 22nd
[48:01] then on 24th we'll be preaching here
[48:05] and then again to other places after
[48:07] that
[48:10] praise the name of our Lord. So my
[48:12] prayer is
[48:14] our young men should come up.
[48:17] [Music]
[48:19] Praise the name of our Lord.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; You know, you can imagine having that
[48:22] vis around.
[48:26] There's a lot of movement,
[48:29] but then you find that you're the one to
[48:31] move with him.
[48:34] Praise the name of our Lord. So I'm
[48:36] praying more young men to rise up
[48:40] with their resources to serve the
[48:42] kingdom of God.
[48:46] Praise the name of our Lord because the
[48:48] burden is big
[48:50] and we need to reach out and see that we
[48:52] support the work of the king.
[48:56] Praise the name of our Lord. So today we
[48:58] have two services
[49:01] and then we have the Lord's supper
[49:02] starting at 5. Before we go, let me
[49:06] invite the youth song.
[49:12] [Music]
[49:55] I'm using my Bible for a road map.
[50:01] Ten commandments
[50:03] they tell me what to do.
[50:08] The 12 disciples are my road signs
[50:14] and Jesus will take me safely through.

[52:08] is heaven on sweet day.
[52:13] Oh, there'll be no peach in here,
[52:19] nor a frost, nor
[52:22] a fro along the way.

[52:49] way. No rough roads along the way. Oh,
[52:55] I'm using
[52:57] I'm using my Bible for
[53:04] my last
[53:07] heaven.

[53:15] a clean heart. If you can, let's get on
[53:19] our feet. Oh,

[56:45] the morning or three
[56:48] when I was praying the Lord put upon my
[56:52] heart
[56:53] to come and preach about overcoming the

[1:00:47] Father,

[1:00:53] to set everyone free, heavenly Lord, to
[1:00:56] heal the sick, Lord. Fill your children
[1:00:59] with your spirit.
[1:01:01] to open the eyes of the blind.
[1:01:04] Make the lame walk.
[1:01:07] Make the deaf fear alone. You are the
[1:01:10] same God we want to thank you for. May
[1:01:13] you speak to us through your word.
[1:01:16] Maness yourself in our lives
[1:01:19] and help us in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:01:22] that we may have a personal relationship
[1:01:26] and walk with you Lord. Bless us father.
[1:01:30] May we rejoice in your presence. We're
[1:01:32] also praying for our pastor and his
[1:01:35] members in May. Lord, may you use him
[1:01:38] for your glory, Father, that your
[1:01:40] purpose and will may be done in those
[1:01:42] meetings.
[1:01:43] Bless us all together today, Lord.
[1:01:46] We love you and we thank you, Father. In
[1:01:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:01:52] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Let us turn to Acts chapter 26.
[1:01:57] Acts
[1:01:59] chapter 26
[1:02:02] we're reading from verse 18
[1:02:08] rather verse 16 up to verse 18
[1:02:13] the Bible says
[1:02:15] but rise and stand upon thy feet for
[1:02:19] I've appeared unto thee for this purpose
[1:02:21] to make thee a minister and a witness
[1:02:24] both of the things which thou hast seen
[1:02:27] and of the things which in which I will
[1:02:30] appear unto thee.
[1:02:50] delivering thee from the people, and
[1:02:52] from the Gentiles, unto whom I now send
[1:02:56] thee,
[1:03:06] to open their eyes, and to turn them
[1:03:09] from darkness to light. and from the
[1:03:12] power of Satan unto God, that they may
[1:03:15] receive the forgiveness of sins and
[1:03:17] inheritance among them which are
[1:03:20] sanctified by faith that is in me.
[1:03:40] of his word. You may become.
[1:03:43] So our text is overcoming the power of
[1:03:46] darkness.
[1:03:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Overcoming
[1:03:52] the power of darkness.
[1:03:55] And you know sin itself
[1:03:59] is darkness.
[1:04:01] Praise the name of our Lord. Sin is
[1:04:03] darkness
[1:04:06] and anything associated with sin
[1:04:10] is darkness.
[1:04:13] Sickness came because of sin.
[1:04:16] So it also reflected as darkness.
[1:04:21] Unbelief
[1:04:23] is darkness.
[1:04:25] Doubt
[1:04:27] is darkness.
[1:04:29] Praise the name of the Lord. And so we
[1:04:32] find that as we live here,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; darkness gets a hold of us
[1:04:40] or in the first place. We were born in
[1:04:44] sin
[1:04:45] and then shaped in iniquity.
[1:04:49] Our first birth
[1:04:51] made us sinners by nature.
[1:04:54] Praise the name of our Lord. Brother,
[1:04:57] you're welcome.
[1:04:59] Praise the name of our Lord. So our
[1:05:01] first birth
[1:05:03] made us sinners
[1:05:07] by nature.
[1:05:09] You know you were born a sinner.
[1:05:13] Like an example you find a small child
[1:05:18] licking sugar
[1:05:20] and then you ask him why have you taken
[1:05:22] that sugar?
[1:05:24] He start denying while wiping them.
[1:05:29] It's just a nature,
[1:05:31] you know, something that you know is in
[1:05:34] you.
[1:05:36] That's why we need the second birth.
[1:05:40] That's why we need to be born again.
[1:05:43] When you are born again,
[1:05:46] then the spirit of God comes down in
[1:05:48] your life.
[1:05:51] Praise the name of Lord. And then it
[1:05:53] changes your nature.
[1:05:56] You become a new creation,
[1:05:59] a creation after righteousness.
[1:06:03] Our first birth
[1:06:05] is a creation after unrighteousness.
[1:06:10] It's a creation after doing wickedness.
[1:06:15] It's a creation of a rebellious kind of
[1:06:17] nature.
[1:06:21] And you see, when you accept the Lord
[1:06:22] Jesus as your personal savior,
[1:06:26] You are denying darkness.
[1:06:29] You are coming out of darkness
[1:06:32] and then what the Lord first does to
[1:06:34] your life,
[1:06:36] he justifies you.
[1:06:38] Praise the name of our Lord. In other
[1:06:40] words, he's saying that whatever you
[1:06:41] have done in the past
[1:06:45] forgiven you, but then in you, you still
[1:06:49] have a desire to do wrong.
[1:06:54] You still have a nature to do wrong.
[1:06:58] So then he takes you sanctification.
[1:07:02] In other words, to separate you
[1:07:05] from those things
[1:07:07] which are not right and then he fills
[1:07:10] you with the Holy Spirit
[1:07:12] which is his own creation
[1:07:17] which is his own new creation.
[1:07:21] And now when he filled with the Holy
[1:07:23] Spirit,
[1:07:25] then the Holy Spirit starts to take
[1:07:28] charge over your human spirit.
[1:07:33] You know what the Bible tells us in
[1:07:35] Romans chapter 8.
[1:07:39] in Romans chapter 8
[1:07:42] and then we can get in verse
[1:07:45] 16.
[1:07:48] He says, "The spirit itself bears
[1:07:51] witness with our human spirit
[1:07:56] that we are the children of God."
[1:07:59] Because your human spirit,
[1:08:02] you get it up here on earth
[1:08:05] to enable this body operate.
[1:08:09] And now your human spirit has all the
[1:08:13] time been subject to the spirit of the
[1:08:15] world.
[1:08:18] From the time you were born, your human
[1:08:21] spirit was held captive
[1:08:25] by the spirit of the world, which is the
[1:08:28] spirit of the devil.
[1:08:30] So then the devil influence your human
[1:08:34] spirit
[1:08:36] because of your nature into the things
[1:08:39] that are contrary to God.
[1:08:42] Praise the name of Lord. But now when
[1:08:44] you accept the Lord Jesus as your
[1:08:46] personal savior,
[1:08:48] And then you receive the baptism of the
[1:08:51] Holy Spirit.
[1:08:52] Then the bapt the Holy Ghost takes over
[1:08:56] your human spirit.
[1:08:58] You know the Bible tells us that a man
[1:09:02] that is alive
[1:09:05] cannot influence himself.
[1:09:08] We can pick that scripture in Jeremiah
[1:09:10] chapter 10.
[1:09:13] Jeremiah chapter 10.
[1:09:17] And then we read
[1:09:19] in verse 23,
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; "Oh Lord, I know that the way of man is
[1:09:27] not in himself. It is not in man that
[1:09:32] walketh to direct his steps."
[1:09:45] He says it's not in us
[1:09:48] to direct yourself.
[1:09:51] So there has to be an influence
[1:09:54] that takes a hold of your life
[1:09:58] that will guide you that will direct
[1:10:01] you. Now when we are born in our first
[1:10:04] birth,
[1:10:06] Satan takes a hold of our human soul
[1:10:10] and then he makes you do whatever you
[1:10:12] want to do
[1:10:15] because the world
[1:10:17] is full of sin.
[1:10:20] You may find that even the home where
[1:10:21] you're being raised up,
[1:10:24] it's all wickedness that is done,
[1:10:28] the community where you live,
[1:10:30] immorality that is done.
[1:10:33] And then brother Brandham says that rock
[1:10:36] and roll
[1:10:42] they will take a hold of any child
[1:10:44] spirit.
[1:10:47] It doesn't matter. It's only the new
[1:10:50] birth that can deliver from that kind of
[1:10:54] thing
[1:10:56] totally easily influenced.
[1:10:59] That's why the Bible says
[1:11:02] that you know in 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[1:11:06] praise the name of our lord 1
[1:11:09] Corinthians chapter 2
[1:11:14] and then we can read from verse 10.
[1:11:18] The Bible says,
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; "But God has revealed them unto us by
[1:11:24] his spirit. For the Spirit searches all
[1:11:27] things, yeah, the deep things of God.
[1:11:38] For what man knows the things of a man,
[1:11:41] save the spirit of man which is in him?
[1:11:43] Even so, the things of God knows no man,
[1:11:47] but the spirit of God.
[1:12:02] Now we have received not the spirit of
[1:12:04] the world, but the spirit which is of
[1:12:08] God, that we might know the things that
[1:12:10] are freely given to us of God.
[1:12:23] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[1:12:25] look at these scriptures,
[1:12:28] there are three kinds of spirits.
[1:12:31] There is the human spirit.
[1:12:34] That's the spirit we are born with.
[1:12:36] As a human being, you must have a human
[1:12:39] spirit. So when your human spirit leaves
[1:12:41] your body,
[1:12:44] then you are dead. But then there is
[1:12:46] also the spirit of the world.
[1:12:50] And the spirit of the world is the
[1:12:52] spirit of Satan.
[1:12:55] And all the evil spirit
[1:12:58] and now spiritually speaking,
[1:13:01] the spirit of the world and the spirit
[1:13:04] of the devils.
[1:13:07] You know, they are the ones that bring
[1:13:09] darkness.
[1:13:11] They are the ones that bring things
[1:13:13] contrary to God
[1:13:16] because that's the mission of Satan.
[1:13:20] He will always make you to do things
[1:13:23] that are contrary to God.
[1:13:26] Now you may not be doing those things.
[1:13:29] But yet you may have the passion of
[1:13:31] those things.
[1:13:34] You may be thinking about those things.
[1:13:37] You may be imagining about those things.
[1:13:40] You may be dreaming about those things.
[1:13:42] But yet you don't do them. It is
[1:13:44] darkness.
[1:13:46] Praise the name of the Lord. Like when
[1:13:48] you have a despising spirit,
[1:13:51] that's darkness.
[1:13:54] When you have a murmuring spirit,
[1:14:03] that is a darkness.
[1:14:07] When you have a complaining spirit,
[1:14:13] murmuring spirit,
[1:14:20] Now the some of these things
[1:14:23] you may not see them but in you they are
[1:14:26] there.
[1:14:29] You look at somebody
[1:14:31] you demean them. Nobody knows that
[1:14:34] you're doing it.
[1:14:36] Some bondage that you have with you.
[1:14:41] You look at something which has
[1:14:43] happened.
[1:14:45] You complain
[1:14:47] you mama
[1:14:49] like now our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:53] Let us go and pick this up
[1:14:56] in Luke chapter 7.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 7
[1:15:05] and let us pick it up from verse 36.
[1:15:13] The Bible says, "And one of the
[1:15:16] Pharisees desired him that he would eat
[1:15:20] with him, and he went into the Pharisees
[1:15:22] house and sat down to meet.
[1:15:33] They invited the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:36] and we have prepared the dinner for him
[1:15:39] and brother Brandham teaches us that God
[1:15:42] keeps his appointment.
[1:15:46] God keeps his appointment.
[1:15:50] God fulfills his word.
[1:15:54] You take God at his word,
[1:15:57] he will perform his word. Praise the
[1:16:00] name of the Lord. Do you believe he can
[1:16:02] perform his word before you?
[1:16:06] Praise the name of our Lord. You take
[1:16:08] him at his word.
[1:16:10] So this Pharisee desired Jesus
[1:16:14] and then the Bible says Jesus came
[1:16:18] and then there was a woman in the city
[1:16:24] which was a sinner.
[1:16:27] And when she she knew that Jesus sat at
[1:16:31] the meet at the Pharisees house,
[1:16:36] she brought an alabaster box of ointment
[1:16:42] and stood at his feet
[1:16:47] behind him weeping
[1:16:52] and began to wash his feet with tears.
[1:16:58] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:17:01] head,
[1:17:04] and he kissed his feet,
[1:17:07] and anointed them with the ointment.
[1:17:11] And when the Pharisee which had bidded
[1:17:13] him saw it,
[1:17:17] he spoke within himself,
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; saying, "This man
[1:17:25] If he were a prophet,
[1:17:28] would have known
[1:17:31] who and what manner of woman this is
[1:17:36] that touches him for she's a sinner.
[1:17:41] He didn't speak it, but it was in the
[1:17:45] heart
[1:17:47] darkness.
[1:17:49] And many people get control in this kind
[1:17:52] of condition.
[1:17:56] He's here
[1:17:58] but his heart is not there.
[1:18:02] He's saying this
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; but is meaning something
[1:18:06] darkness. Actually it is a hypocrisy.
[1:18:11] So now this man was complaining.
[1:18:15] Oh this woman cannot do that. How can
[1:18:18] you allow this man?
[1:18:24] There's some form of darkness
[1:18:29] holding such a kind of station
[1:18:33] just like the same thing.
[1:18:35] When the Bible says,
[1:18:38] let us pick that scripture also
[1:18:41] in Matthew chapter 5
[1:18:45] and then we pick it up in verse
[1:18:49] Matthew chapter 5.
[1:18:55] Let me get the scripture here.
[1:19:01] Verse
[1:19:07] 27.
[1:19:10] You've heard that it was said by them of
[1:19:12] old time, thou shalt not commit
[1:19:15] adultery.
[1:19:22] Now that was an act
[1:19:26] physically into it
[1:19:29] that he said you have heard.
[1:19:33] So what do you do now? Verse 28. But I
[1:19:37] say unto you that soever lookth on a
[1:19:42] woman to lust after her has committed
[1:19:45] adultery with her already in his heart.
[1:19:59] Now you have not gone into the act
[1:20:03] but just merely looking.
[1:20:07] He says you have committed the act.
[1:20:11] So the one who is looking is responsible
[1:20:17] is having the spirit of a doubt.
[1:20:20] And then the woman who was dressed in a
[1:20:22] funny way,
[1:20:25] you know, tight clothes,
[1:20:29] you know, the devil, the devil likes
[1:20:31] promoting what he has.
[1:20:36] He likes how to bring it on adverts
[1:20:42] and he brings some kind of fashion
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; and then you admire that fashion.
[1:20:49] and then you put on tight clothes.
[1:20:52] But it is an evil spirit.
[1:20:55] It's a spirit of adultery
[1:20:58] that anoints you for you to put on
[1:21:01] clothes
[1:21:03] where men can lust after you
[1:21:07] darkness.
[1:21:09] So when you go to buy any clothes,
[1:21:13] decide yourself
[1:21:16] when I put on this clothes
[1:21:19] How will I be before people?
[1:21:22] Why do I want to expose my body?
[1:21:26] Why do I want men to last after me?
[1:21:30] Why do I want people to see my figure
[1:21:32] how it is built up and things like that?
[1:21:38] It's darkness. And you know the Bible
[1:21:40] also tells us
[1:21:43] when we go to Proverbs chapter 7.
[1:21:48] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 7
[1:21:54] and then let us speak this scripture
[1:21:55] here.
[1:21:58] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:22:03] Let me get it.
[1:22:13] Proverbs 7 verse 10.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; And behold, there met him a woman with
[1:22:20] the utter of a harot and subtile of
[1:22:23] heart.
[1:22:38] Now her dresses reflected the evil
[1:22:42] spirit in her.
[1:22:48] She had a spirit of adultery.
[1:22:52] And now that spirit of adultery
[1:22:55] made her outside
[1:22:59] to show what is inside of us.
[1:23:03] darkness,
[1:23:05] bondage.
[1:23:07] So even now with all the fashions that
[1:23:10] the devil is producing
[1:23:14] where you put on tight clothes,
[1:23:18] you know where you put on clothes that
[1:23:20] expose your private parts of the body.
[1:23:26] It's the spirit of adultery.
[1:23:29] It's the spirit of how
[1:23:32] [Music]
[1:23:35] because they are displaying what they
[1:23:37] have.
[1:23:39] They are promoting what they have.
[1:23:41] It's
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; darkness.
[1:23:44] So now
[1:23:45] for you to be delivered,
[1:23:48] you need that power of darkness
[1:23:53] to completely be uprooted away from you
[1:23:58] that you can get the spirit of Christ
[1:24:01] to come and govern your heart.
[1:24:05] So now when you go to the shop,
[1:24:08] you'll make the right decision of what
[1:24:10] to buy.
[1:24:12] when you are going to dress up, you'll
[1:24:15] make the right decision of what to put
[1:24:17] on.
[1:24:19] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:24:21] why we need the new birth,
[1:24:24] the Holy Spirit
[1:24:26] to come and take charge of our human
[1:24:28] spirit,
[1:24:30] when your human spirit is under Satan
[1:24:36] to fro
[1:24:38] and then you'll do whatever the devil
[1:24:40] desires.
[1:24:43] But now when your human spirit is under
[1:24:46] the leadership of the Holy Spirit,
[1:24:49] you will do what God wants you to do.
[1:24:53] And it will not be a burden to you.
[1:24:56] It will not be a law.
[1:24:59] Praise the name of the Lord. It will be
[1:25:01] a joy to you
[1:25:04] for you to do the things of God.
[1:25:07] Praise the name of the Lord. Why?
[1:25:10] because your nature has been changed.
[1:25:15] And so your nature,
[1:25:17] you desire the things of God.
[1:25:21] You desire to follow after
[1:25:22] righteousness.
[1:25:25] Like when Noah had had birds and animals
[1:25:28] in the ark,
[1:25:31] praise the name of our Lord. And now it
[1:25:34] had stopped raining.
[1:25:38] And Noah wanted to find out what is on
[1:25:40] earth.
[1:25:43] So he sent messengers
[1:25:46] and he had messengers
[1:25:48] and he sent them messengers of different
[1:25:51] nature
[1:25:55] in Genesis chapter 8.
[1:25:58] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:26:00] The Bible says in verse seven,
[1:26:03] "And it came to pass at the end of 40
[1:26:05] days that Noah opened the window of the
[1:26:08] ark which he had made.
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:20] And he sent forth a raven which went
[1:26:23] forth to and fro until the waters were
[1:26:27] dried up from the earth.
[1:26:36] Now this raven
[1:26:39] grow
[1:26:43] vulture
[1:26:49] didn't meet the fellowship. Didn't miss
[1:26:50] the fellowship in the ark.
[1:26:56] But when he went on the waters
[1:26:59] and got dead bodies on top of the water
[1:27:01] floating
[1:27:05] started feasting
[1:27:09] from this dead body to the other dead
[1:27:11] body to the other dead body and the
[1:27:14] Bible says until the earth dried
[1:27:18] many days
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:22] it was feeding on dead body.
[1:27:30] things.
[1:27:35] They have been punishing us at home
[1:27:38] every time.
[1:27:40] Now I have the opportunity.
[1:27:43] I'm in university.
[1:27:45] I'll wear the way I want.
[1:27:48] I'll sleep where I want to sleep.
[1:27:51] Who's going to follow me up?
[1:27:55] Because of the nature,
[1:27:59] the nature was unconverted.
[1:28:04] They can be like a married man.
[1:28:08] They give him a trip to go overseas.
[1:28:17] Who will be there to see me? Lives a
[1:28:20] very immoral life up there.
[1:28:24] Raven,
[1:28:28] this dirty thing tonight
[1:28:33] at home. I've been missing this
[1:28:37] now.
[1:28:39] God has served me. But that Satan that
[1:28:44] this year that
[1:28:48] there
[1:28:50] was the raven
[1:28:53] the nature was not converted.
[1:28:57] Ah this one is a good deal
[1:29:06] now in the message.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me let me just speak this here
[1:29:17] in the message questions and answers.
[1:29:21] Brother Brandham says, "Look in the ark.
[1:29:25] Noah turned the crow out."
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Now, what was he?
[1:29:33] He was a crow.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. He sat on the same roost.
[1:29:46] He sat on the same roost where the dove
[1:29:48] was.
[1:29:55] They both sat in the same ro.
[1:29:59] But when he turned the old crow out
[1:30:06] because they were all in the ark
[1:30:08] and in the ark there was nothing rotten.
[1:30:12] So this scroll here
[1:30:16] would eat millet
[1:30:20] The way the dove was eating milk
[1:30:24] would eat maze
[1:30:27] the way this one was eating.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; But the dove does not have bile.
[1:30:37] So it can't digest rotten things.
[1:30:43] It kills it. But now this Mr. Crow
[1:30:51] It's dirty things and those which are
[1:30:53] not dirty. So when he was released out
[1:30:56] of the ark
[1:31:01] here there is no church. What an
[1:31:03] opportunity
[1:31:07] I can sleep the whole Sunday. That's the
[1:31:10] nature of a crow.
[1:31:14] So it went when it was released out of
[1:31:16] the app.
[1:31:19] Brother Brandham says,
[1:31:23] "I imagine all the waters was stinking
[1:31:26] with millions of people's swelled
[1:31:28] bodies.
[1:31:38] And the horses and the animals all dead.
[1:31:44] The whole world was dead.
[1:31:47] And there they was
[1:31:50] this old dead carcasses of floating
[1:31:52] things on top of the water
[1:31:57] and things like that.
[1:31:59] And Noah turned the dove out.
[1:32:04] He guessed the he saw the sun the
[1:32:07] sunshine
[1:32:10] and he wanted to know whether the water
[1:32:12] had receded or not.
[1:32:17] When he turned the crow out,
[1:32:20] the old crow fruit down
[1:32:25] to an old dead body
[1:32:29] and then say my
[1:32:32] just fine
[1:32:35] that is good
[1:32:38] nature
[1:32:41] thisole
[1:32:43] I can't miss
[1:32:46] ladies night
[1:32:49] first lady.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; I can't get the first one.
[1:33:02] This that thing
[1:33:05] that
[1:33:07] so then
[1:33:09] it was jumping from dead body to dead
[1:33:11] body.
[1:33:15] You can imagine how many days
[1:33:20] until the water came down.
[1:33:23] This one was eating this dirt that he
[1:33:26] had already forgotten about.
[1:33:31] No more mind about the messenger.
[1:33:41] Those are none of my concern. Cut a
[1:33:44] thing here.
[1:33:46] Bondage.
[1:33:48] And then he says
[1:33:50] eating dead body.
[1:33:52] [Music]
[1:33:55] That was his nature.
[1:33:58] He was a crow.
[1:34:01] No matter how much would set with the D,
[1:34:07] how much would have had Noah preach.
[1:34:11] how much would have set with the clean
[1:34:14] B.
[1:34:16] He was a crow to begin with
[1:34:20] as soon as he got the opportunity
[1:34:24] to show his colors.
[1:34:28] He showed it
[1:34:33] do everything they want to do.
[1:34:36] Darkness, it's a bondage.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; But now When he turned the dove out,
[1:34:45] when she started out,
[1:34:49] she couldn't stand that.
[1:34:54] Nowhere she would go.
[1:34:57] She wouldn't find rest for the souls of
[1:35:00] her feet.
[1:35:04] So, she came back to the earth.
[1:35:07] That's the way it is. Praise the name of
[1:35:10] our Lord. You know in in Genesis chapter
[1:35:14] 8
[1:35:15] verse 7. He released the raven
[1:35:20] a man with an old nature
[1:35:23] and converted
[1:35:28] Sunday in church
[1:35:30] Monday.
[1:35:32] What I missed on Sunday?
[1:35:35] Let me go and enjoy myself.
[1:35:40] That's a crow.
[1:35:42] But now a dove.
[1:35:46] When the dove leaves Sunday,
[1:35:49] [Music]
[1:35:55] he's longing for another Sunday.
[1:35:59] When will I come back in the presence?
[1:36:02] In verse eight, and he sent forth a dove
[1:36:07] from him to see if the waters were
[1:36:10] abetted
[1:36:14] from off the face of the ground.
[1:36:17] But the dove found no rest for the soul
[1:36:19] of her feet.
[1:36:25] And she returned unto him into the
[1:36:27] earth.
[1:36:29] for the waters were on the face of the
[1:36:32] whole earth.
[1:36:35] Then he put forth his hand
[1:36:38] and took her and pulled her in the ark.
[1:36:45] Praise the name of
[1:36:47] Now you see what the what happens with
[1:36:50] this kind of natures.
[1:36:54] The dove couldn't find peace
[1:36:58] because it was not her nature
[1:37:02] to fly over dirt things.
[1:37:04] It was not her nature to go and eat dirt
[1:37:08] things. It was stinking.
[1:37:13] Praise the name of the Lord. And that's
[1:37:15] the same thing if you are a true
[1:37:17] Christian.
[1:37:20] Your mind
[1:37:22] is not how much you can live with sin.
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:29] If you're a true Christian,
[1:37:32] your mind will be like this.
[1:37:35] How long will I endure this?
[1:37:39] But your mind is like this.
[1:37:42] Let me get off this sin. You'll not
[1:37:45] allow something wrong.
[1:37:48] But you'll see how you avoid it as much
[1:37:50] as possible.
[1:37:54] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:37:56] to First Thessalonians chapter 5.
[1:38:00] 1 Thessonians chapter 5.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; And then we read verse 22.
[1:38:13] Abstain from all appearance of evil.
[1:38:18] 12
[1:38:20] 5 2022
[1:38:30] he saidain
[1:38:36] in other words see that you don't go
[1:38:39] where you know that there is sin
[1:38:43] you know what happens in birth
[1:38:46] then Where do I go?
[1:38:52] My friends have called me in the back.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; For them, they will be drinking beer and
[1:38:57] I'll be taking soda.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; There is somewhere where one company
[1:39:00] which makes beer was making sodas.
[1:39:04] But then made sure that whatever they
[1:39:06] were making was packaged like beers.
[1:39:10] People could not be fooled.
[1:39:14] People could not be fooled.
[1:39:16] until that thing had to close
[1:39:19] that line wouldn't continue.
[1:39:23] You know why are you in those places?
[1:39:27] Why
[1:39:29] you what pleases you is where dirt
[1:39:32] things are.
[1:39:36] Like now if you're looking for a place
[1:39:37] to rent,
[1:39:40] you want to rent where lodes are.
[1:39:46] You want to rent where you know disco
[1:39:50] are
[1:39:51] nightclubs
[1:39:55] neighborhood for you. You're not
[1:39:56] bothered
[1:39:59] for me. Just bring the sleeper.
[1:40:04] You abstain
[1:40:06] and you pray against those things that
[1:40:08] happen in your community.
[1:40:12] You are crying. You are dying against
[1:40:16] the abomination that are done in the
[1:40:17] place where you living.
[1:40:21] Praise the name of our Lord. Like now
[1:40:23] you see the madness which has been
[1:40:24] happening in schools.
[1:40:28] Proh
[1:40:36] dresses funny, a boy dresses funny
[1:40:43] or senior six
[1:40:45] and then they start pairing themselves
[1:40:48] and you say
[1:40:52] comes also. Thank God the government has
[1:40:54] banned those things.
[1:40:58] very funny things.
[1:41:01] This boy comes,
[1:41:03] you know, they they act like they are
[1:41:05] couples,
[1:41:08] very funny things.
[1:41:12] And I pray God gives us grace,
[1:41:15] even the funny spirits on introduction,
[1:41:22] you know, when they see women come
[1:41:28] And then now they send boys or men.
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:34] When they see men come,
[1:41:37] they give women belts.
[1:41:43] Funny things which happen
[1:41:45] and then we rejoice.
[1:41:49] Evil spirits,
[1:41:51] darkness, that's not culture.
[1:41:55] It's not culture, it's similarity,
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; but that's the thing which people get
[1:42:02] excited.
[1:42:05] And then you see young men when they
[1:42:08] come, it's as if they are coming to grab
[1:42:10] whatever they coming to grab.
[1:42:17] And then they embarrass the women.
[1:42:21] Some are not interested in that thing.
[1:42:23] Of course, they are those who feed on
[1:42:25] those things,
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; but others are not interested in.
[1:42:31] And then they just embarrass
[1:42:38] very funny things
[1:42:40] and then maybe if it is a married man or
[1:42:42] married woman,
[1:42:45] he has never
[1:42:49] dancing with a stranger.
[1:42:53] very funny way.
[1:42:56] You know these are wicked spirit that
[1:42:58] come.
[1:42:59] But of course there are those crows who
[1:43:01] like that
[1:43:06] now you
[1:43:10] get yourself in that case
[1:43:17] in that prison if you are going it why
[1:43:20] do you go and participate
[1:43:24] and participate in that
[1:43:27] somebody to just kind of you dance with
[1:43:30] you, hug you, do whatever they want to
[1:43:32] do.
[1:43:35] Funny things. And then they want to
[1:43:38] maybe put a belt around
[1:43:41] or put the shoes on.
[1:43:43] It's bad. But these are the things we
[1:43:46] have in our communities.
[1:43:49] But it is vultures which like those
[1:43:51] things.
[1:43:53] Praise the name of our Lord. And what
[1:43:55] makes strange
[1:43:58] you get homes of believers.
[1:44:02] It's the believer who is coming to be
[1:44:04] introduced
[1:44:06] and it's the believer who is going to
[1:44:07] introduce.
[1:44:09] The parents are believers.
[1:44:11] And then there is secular music there.
[1:44:17] funny things
[1:44:20] about life.
[1:44:24] So the Bible says abstain from all
[1:44:28] appearance of evil.
[1:44:32] Praise the name of the Lord because all
[1:44:34] these are avenues.
[1:44:37] Satan take a hold of you.
[1:44:40] You know Satan is so sabotaged.
[1:44:44] He uses every opportunity there
[1:44:49] to take a hold of a person.
[1:44:52] He uses many opportunities.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; One,
[1:44:57] you know, it may be something you
[1:44:59] because Satan is a spirit.
[1:45:02] So you can use any point of contact.
[1:45:08] Maybe what you watch on your phone and
[1:45:11] it becomes a bondage,
[1:45:15] maybe what you hear on the radio, it
[1:45:18] becomes a bondage or what you saw on
[1:45:21] television, it becomes a bondage. Or
[1:45:24] even what you read in your spirit,
[1:45:27] it becomes a bondage.
[1:45:29] Or maybe in your community
[1:45:32] some funny spirits which are there,
[1:45:35] some funny things which are done there.
[1:45:38] Then you get taken a hold because you
[1:45:40] have a human spirit. And this human
[1:45:43] spirit can be influenced by any spirit
[1:45:49] because from childhood
[1:45:52] your human spirit has always been under
[1:45:55] influence.
[1:45:58] Your parents first influenced you
[1:46:02] and now to make it worse.
[1:46:05] When the parents don't raise you,
[1:46:08] you are raised by mates.
[1:46:12] Then you see this m comes with this evil
[1:46:14] spirit.
[1:46:16] The other one comes with another evil
[1:46:18] spirit.
[1:46:19] The other one comes complaining the
[1:46:21] child.
[1:46:23] If the other one comes knows how to
[1:46:25] abuse,
[1:46:27] the child will start abusing. You start
[1:46:29] wondering
[1:46:31] but you know she has got a door from
[1:46:33] different mates.
[1:46:37] This one comes with this father spirit.
[1:46:40] This one.
[1:46:46] So the child just knows all those
[1:46:48] things.
[1:46:51] wondering where is this thing coming
[1:46:52] from?
[1:46:54] Influence
[1:46:56] because they have a spirit and so they
[1:46:59] always look to the person they spend
[1:47:01] most of the time with
[1:47:05] like maybe in the community
[1:47:08] your children are all the time in the
[1:47:09] neighborhood playing
[1:47:12] don't have control over them there.
[1:47:16] picking this funny spirit, picking this
[1:47:18] funny spirit, learning how to steal,
[1:47:23] learning how to do this,
[1:47:27] influence.
[1:47:29] So then we need to see that we are born
[1:47:33] again
[1:47:35] and if you have children,
[1:47:37] see how you influence them in the way of
[1:47:39] the Lord.
[1:47:42] Find out, take interest in your
[1:47:44] children.
[1:47:47] You know Satan has has all schemes.
[1:47:51] You are looking for the money and surely
[1:47:54] you need it but your family is being
[1:47:56] destroyed.
[1:47:59] I have to make money. When you come home
[1:48:02] no time of fellowship with the children.
[1:48:06] You are tired
[1:48:08] in the morning I have to go.
[1:48:11] Somebody else is raising your child.
[1:48:14] But what kind of spirits?
[1:48:17] Maybe it's the reven raising your child
[1:48:22] and then you'll have another revenue in
[1:48:24] your home.
[1:48:27] You know, because we have to be careful.
[1:48:31] These are spirits.
[1:48:33] Now in 2 Corinthians chapter 10,
[1:48:38] praise the name of our Lord. 2
[1:48:40] Corinthians chapter 10.
[1:48:47] And then we read from verse three.
[1:48:53] The Bible says, "For though we walk in
[1:48:56] the flesh,
[1:48:59] we don't walk after the flesh."
[1:49:06] That's what the Bible is telling us. We
[1:49:08] walk in this flesh,
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; but our battles
[1:49:13] and not in this flesh. Where are the
[1:49:15] battles?
[1:49:17] For the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:49:20] cannon,
[1:49:23] but mighty through God,
[1:49:27] pulling down the stronghold,
[1:49:33] casting down imaginations
[1:49:37] and every high thing that exalts against
[1:49:41] the knowledge of God.
[1:49:49] and bringing into captivity every
[1:49:51] thought to the obedience of Christ
[1:49:59] and having in a readiness to revenge all
[1:50:02] disobedience when your obedience is
[1:50:05] fulfilled.
[1:50:15] Praise the name of our Lord. He says we
[1:50:17] don't wrestle with flesh and blood.
[1:50:21] And so the devil is so smart
[1:50:25] that he get things that can easily
[1:50:27] influence any person.
[1:50:32] Like I was reading about those
[1:50:34] billionaires who make these programs
[1:50:36] that operate phones and computers.
[1:50:39] I was reading about them
[1:50:42] and then these people they have strict
[1:50:46] regulations
[1:50:49] to their children
[1:50:52] not spend a lot of time on this thing.
[1:50:57] They control their children like nothing
[1:51:01] until they are children not all the time
[1:51:04] on these things.
[1:51:06] Then for us who receive them
[1:51:11] You know the child
[1:51:13] will you leave
[1:51:18] now? What is in this tool?
[1:51:22] Then the child is grown up on an iPad
[1:51:28] until you can't take them away from me.
[1:51:33] bound.
[1:51:40] Until these kids not to go to places you
[1:51:42] have never gone to,
[1:51:47] spirits
[1:51:49] and then the child can become rough
[1:51:53] when you remove the phone
[1:51:56] or he can throw it down
[1:52:00] or fight you back.
[1:52:02] pulling it from you.
[1:52:05] How are we bringing our children up?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; You know, you need to handle the child
[1:52:13] very well.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Were you raised with a phone?
[1:52:21] Praise the name of
[1:52:24] But that's how the generation is.
[1:52:28] Is the devil has perverted us.
[1:52:33] until we have left the first principles
[1:52:35] of raising children.
[1:52:39] All the time on phone,
[1:52:42] all the time on phone until they get
[1:52:44] into dirty things.
[1:52:47] And by the time you discover
[1:52:51] they are fully destroyed,
[1:52:55] but they are your children.
[1:52:57] And then you find is hard to live with
[1:52:59] your children.
[1:53:03] Who do you want to raise them when you
[1:53:05] have already spoiled them? But we have a
[1:53:08] responsibility.
[1:53:11] You know, Satan is so tricky,
[1:53:18] you see that even you at your age,
[1:53:21] you must have selfont control.
[1:53:26] Self control.
[1:53:28] How about this small child who doesn't
[1:53:30] know things
[1:53:32] goes on a channel
[1:53:35] like now some of these channels you go
[1:53:38] to Tik Tok the only thing to go to the
[1:53:41] next you just
[1:53:45] and another comes in again another and
[1:53:48] the systems know how to pile them
[1:53:50] together
[1:53:53] artificial intelligence
[1:53:57] Because these people are smart.
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:00] They can they can use they can do
[1:54:03] research
[1:54:06] and they know that this contact here.
[1:54:13] He wants people who are naked.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; So the advers just come in that line.
[1:54:23] this one.
[1:54:25] So they just come in that line.
[1:54:30] Then once in a while others pop up.
[1:54:36] The seekers
[1:54:38] say, "Hey, why is this?"
[1:54:42] Now when you open there, it takes you to
[1:54:45] most sides of that.
[1:54:49] You must exercise self control
[1:54:54] and this thing I'm not going there.
[1:54:59] How about the small child
[1:55:04] and they know that the data is over
[1:55:08] there is no data
[1:55:11] or if they get some small money
[1:55:13] buy for me data
[1:55:16] feeding on that things.
[1:55:19] Satan is doing a lot of destruction.
[1:55:25] So then we need to be careful
[1:55:29] you know darkness just keeps on
[1:55:31] creeping.
[1:55:34] So you find somebody is bound by evil
[1:55:36] spirit.
[1:55:39] This one is also bound by evil spirit
[1:55:42] until darkness just takes over.
[1:55:46] No time to read the word of God.
[1:55:49] No time to pray. No time to testify.
[1:55:54] no time to think about the things of
[1:55:55] God.
[1:55:58] And so you find that when they get the
[1:56:00] phone, they may even spend a whole night
[1:56:02] on the phone.
[1:56:06] But when it comes to reading the word,
[1:56:12] you start and then you start dozing.
[1:56:15] You put your head in the book.
[1:56:18] But we have a lot of books with us.
[1:56:21] That is darkness.
[1:56:23] There is a bondage that Satan has taken
[1:56:26] a hold
[1:56:28] until you even don't know the things of
[1:56:31] God.
[1:56:34] Like the way Balam,
[1:56:37] the way he led the children of Israel
[1:56:41] into the feast of Balpio,
[1:56:45] the glor of God came down
[1:56:48] and then there was judgment in the camp.
[1:56:52] But then there was a person.
[1:56:56] Let us go to the book of Numbers.
[1:57:00] Numbers
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; chapter 20.
[1:57:20] Let us go to the book of numbers.
[1:57:24] Just I beg your pardon. Let me just
[1:57:30] 23.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Abinat,
[1:57:42] okay, sorry. 25
[1:57:45] and then the Bible says in verse one,
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; and Israel abim
[1:57:51] and the people began to commit war with
[1:57:53] the daughters of Moab.
[1:58:02] Now the Jews
[1:58:04] they had a particular dressing of
[1:58:06] selfrespect.
[1:58:11] They had a particular when they
[1:58:12] worshiped
[1:58:15] and now here Balam
[1:58:18] taught Balac
[1:58:21] how to cause a stumbling block to the
[1:58:23] children of Israel.
[1:58:27] telling them we are all one
[1:58:31] let us socialize
[1:58:34] and then now these people get there
[1:58:38] because Israel was passing in the land
[1:58:40] of Balam
[1:58:44] and so now when Israel was passing
[1:58:46] through Moab
[1:58:49] then these people decided
[1:58:53] what we do Now
[1:58:57] let us do everything we can to have
[1:58:59] these people with us.
[1:59:02] Like's wife,
[1:59:06] Joseph had selfrespect.
[1:59:10] But now Pifer's wife
[1:59:13] comes and dressed before Joseph.
[1:59:17] We alone here.
[1:59:21] Joseph had just run away.
[1:59:25] Now here the children of Israel
[1:59:28] said, "Ah, what dancing stroke is this
[1:59:31] one?"
[1:59:35] And then they got themselves into that
[1:59:37] wickedness,
[1:59:40] eating fruits of idols,
[1:59:45] swinging around,
[1:59:47] everybody picking whoever they wanted,
[1:59:50] going down to idols.
[1:59:53] committing a doubt of
[1:59:56] and then the Bible says
[1:59:58] Israel
[2:00:00] began to commit wardom with the
[2:00:02] daughters of Moab.
[2:00:07] But how did it reach there?
[2:00:10] They got into an atmosphere
[2:00:14] where it was darkness
[2:00:18] and they lasted after that.
[2:00:22] They desire to do the same thing.
[2:00:26] You know, it's just like people who are
[2:00:27] married.
[2:00:29] Why do people who have failed in their
[2:00:31] marriages be your friends?
[2:00:37] Those are your friends who have failed
[2:00:38] in marriage.
[2:00:45] that when he says anything I will not
[2:00:47] care
[2:00:49] or get Nigerian things which can teach
[2:00:51] you how to coach something
[2:00:59] why would you go to dirty places
[2:01:03] to learn how to behave right?
[2:01:07] Why?
[2:01:09] You know, and then you know, you find
[2:01:10] that now to you that's now the way to
[2:01:12] go.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Why
[2:01:19] like now if you you really want to see
[2:01:22] that you get into a certain place
[2:01:25] further,
[2:01:29] somebody who has done it better than
[2:01:30] you,
[2:01:33] not somebody who is discouraging you.
[2:01:36] If you're a student and you want to
[2:01:38] continue your study, why do you get
[2:01:41] people don't go to school?
[2:01:47] This one is studying, just wasting time.
[2:01:49] They pulling you back.
[2:01:53] Some of your friends don't want to work.
[2:01:56] You also get the same spirit.
[2:02:00] You know, you are just associating
[2:02:01] yourself with something wrong.
[2:02:04] So the Bible says
[2:02:06] And they called the people unto the
[2:02:08] sacrifices of their gods. And the people
[2:02:11] did eat and bow down to their gods.
[2:02:23] And Israel joined himself at Balpio. And
[2:02:26] the anger of the Lord was kindled
[2:02:28] against Israel.
[2:02:31] [Music]
[2:02:40] And so then the Lord said unto Moses,
[2:02:43] "Take all the heads of the people and
[2:02:45] hung them up before the Lord against the
[2:02:48] sun, that the fierce of the Lord may be
[2:02:51] turned away from Israel.
[2:03:08] And behold, one of the children of
[2:03:10] Israel, came and brought unto his
[2:03:12] brethren a Midionite woman in the sight
[2:03:15] of Moses, and in the sight of all the
[2:03:18] congregation of the children of Israel,
[2:03:19] who were weeping before the door of the
[2:03:22] tabernacle of the congregation.
[2:03:41] Now you see these people are already
[2:03:43] weeping
[2:03:45] but the other one is bound by darkness
[2:03:49] is bound by that kind of spirit
[2:03:52] has no sense at all. He's going where
[2:03:56] there is rust
[2:04:00] doing something which is wrongful.
[2:04:03] And that's how the devil does.
[2:04:05] You know, somebody can be living in sin
[2:04:10] and used to doing it
[2:04:12] and doesn't care when they continue,
[2:04:16] you know, just continuously
[2:04:20] a real bondage.
[2:04:23] But we need to come out of all this
[2:04:26] darkness.
[2:04:29] Whatever bondage that is in our lives,
[2:04:32] we need to overcome it today.
[2:04:35] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[2:04:38] overcome it today.
[2:04:40] Whatever your situation you are going
[2:04:42] through,
[2:04:44] it may be that you don't show it,
[2:04:47] but it's a spiritual condition.
[2:04:50] There are evil spirits that have bound
[2:04:53] you
[2:04:55] like those seven demons that were in
[2:04:56] Mary Magdalene,
[2:05:00] you know, you know, proud,
[2:05:02] you know, some of those spirits
[2:05:05] like the Bible says in Ephesians chapter
[2:05:08] 4,
[2:05:11] let us go and pick that scripture.
[2:05:16] Ephesians chapter 4
[2:05:21] and then verse 30
[2:05:24] says, "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[2:05:26] God, whereby you are sealed unto the day
[2:05:29] of redemption,
[2:05:40] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[2:05:45] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[2:05:49] from you with all malice.
[2:06:03] He says, "Put away
[2:06:08] bitterness,
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; wrath,
[2:06:12] anger,
[2:06:14] clamor,
[2:06:17] evil speaking,
[2:06:19] malice.
[2:06:22] Put them away."
[2:06:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Put them
[2:06:27] away. There's darkness.
[2:06:31] Praise the name of our Lord. So then you
[2:06:33] must be willing
[2:06:37] to be delivered out of that condition.
[2:06:41] Praise the name of the Lord. Now in the
[2:06:43] in the scriptures here,
[2:06:46] let us go to Matthew,
[2:06:49] Matthew chapter 4
[2:06:52] and then verse 16.
[2:06:55] The Bible says
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; the people which sat in darkness saw
[2:07:01] great light.
[2:07:13] You may also be sitting in darkness.
[2:07:17] You are bound in one way or another.
[2:07:20] The Bible says the people which sat in
[2:07:23] darkness,
[2:07:25] they saw the great light.
[2:07:28] Praise the name of Lord. And we have the
[2:07:30] great light coming to us.
[2:07:33] That we can leave our darkness.
[2:07:36] We can leave our evil thoughts. We can
[2:07:39] leave all our bondages.
[2:07:41] We can leave everything that has held us
[2:07:44] back
[2:07:45] and run into the light. Praise the name
[2:07:48] of God. And then the Bible says, "And to
[2:07:51] them which sat in the region and shadow
[2:07:53] of death, light is sprung up.
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:06] From that time Jesus began to preach and
[2:08:10] to say, "Repent for the kingdom of
[2:08:13] heaven is at hand.
[2:08:26] The first step of living darkness,
[2:08:30] repent.
[2:08:32] Praise the name of God. Repent and be
[2:08:36] willing.
[2:08:37] Lord have mercy upon me.
[2:08:40] Lord, deliver me in this kind of
[2:08:42] condition.
[2:08:44] Now in the message the secret seal,
[2:08:47] brother Brandham says, "And so God,
[2:08:51] if we will be willing to confess our
[2:08:55] sins,
[2:08:59] and do that which is right,
[2:09:03] and ask for mercy,
[2:09:06] call upon him.
[2:09:09] God is willing
[2:09:12] and waiting
[2:09:14] to grant it to us
[2:09:16] out of darkness.
[2:09:19] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[2:09:21] the amount of darkness that's binding
[2:09:23] you this morning.
[2:09:27] God is willing.
[2:09:29] God is waiting.
[2:09:31] Confess it before the Lord.
[2:09:34] Lord, I'm bound by
[2:09:38] Lord. I'm bound by this wickedness.
[2:09:41] Lord, I'm bound by
[2:09:45] confess it before the Lord and show him
[2:09:48] you don't like it.
[2:09:50] Praise the name of the Lord. Show him I
[2:09:52] don't like this.
[2:09:55] When I dress, I dress things that are
[2:09:58] tight.
[2:09:59] They make me happy. You repent about
[2:10:02] that. And then you have that spirit
[2:10:05] leave you.
[2:10:07] Praise the name of Lord in my life. I
[2:10:11] like hanging around these kind of
[2:10:13] people.
[2:10:14] They are wrong people. But yet you feel
[2:10:17] happy. You want to move with him.
[2:10:19] You confess it. The Lord deliver me from
[2:10:22] this
[2:10:25] like the prodigal son. He knew where he
[2:10:28] came from.
[2:10:30] Praise the name of God. He was in light
[2:10:33] with his father. And then the group
[2:10:36] influences
[2:10:44] you know they say you are old style
[2:10:49] you are smart
[2:10:51] why don't you come and do this and
[2:10:53] he left light and went into darkness
[2:10:58] and when he was in darkness
[2:11:01] it really worked
[2:11:05] And then he came to his senses.
[2:11:10] He decided,
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; I will arise
[2:11:14] and go back to my father.
[2:11:17] You also need to make that decision.
[2:11:20] Whatever darkness that is holding,
[2:11:23] you need to make a decision.
[2:11:26] Lord, deliver me out of this.
[2:11:29] Lord, set me out of this situation.
[2:11:32] I'm not pleasant with the way I hear.
[2:11:35] I'm not pleasant with the things I read.
[2:11:38] I'm not pleasant with the things I see.
[2:11:41] I'm not pleasant with the things I hear.
[2:11:44] Whenever I get my phone, all my data
[2:11:49] goes to funny things.
[2:11:52] Confess it,
[2:11:53] repent about it, and turn around from
[2:11:57] it.
[2:11:59] Praise the name of you. believe those
[2:12:01] wicked things.
[2:12:03] If your time you are hanging out around
[2:12:05] bars,
[2:12:08] if the time you are hanging out around
[2:12:10] sports betting places
[2:12:13] or you hang out around
[2:12:17] or where politicians sit
[2:12:22] these days they make shrines for them.
[2:12:24] You get those shrines on the road
[2:12:28] and then you also want to hang there.
[2:12:30] You confess, Lord, I don't want this
[2:12:32] kind of.
[2:12:34] And then you leave it. It's darkness.
[2:12:39] You turn from those evil things.
[2:12:42] And then that's how the Lord can deliver
[2:12:44] you.
[2:12:46] If you are willing,
[2:12:50] confess it.
[2:12:52] Lord, I don't want this kind of
[2:12:56] praise the name of now in the message.
[2:12:58] How can I overcome?
[2:13:01] He says
[2:13:05] overcome means to stand the test.
[2:13:11] That is right. Like all the old saints
[2:13:14] did.
[2:13:16] Jesus did. Amidst all of his enemies,
[2:13:21] he stood the test.
[2:13:23] Everything was tested against
[2:13:26] he stood.
[2:13:29] In the very face of sickness
[2:13:32] and him being Messiah,
[2:13:35] he healed them. In the face of death, he
[2:13:39] brought it back to life.
[2:13:42] In the face of Calvary,
[2:13:45] his own death, he defeated it by
[2:13:48] surrendering himself.
[2:13:51] Why? By the word of God
[2:13:54] said, he destroyed this temple.
[2:13:58] and I'll raise it up in three days.
[2:14:01] The word said so. And in the presence of
[2:14:05] death,
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; he defeated it.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; He overcame death. In the presence of
[2:14:11] hell, he defeated hell. And overcame
[2:14:15] hell. Yes. In the presence of the grave,
[2:14:19] he overcame the grave. Why? All by the
[2:14:23] word
[2:14:25] and humility.
[2:14:27] There is the real man. There is the one
[2:14:30] to make your example.
[2:14:34] He defeated everything.
[2:14:37] Overcame
[2:14:39] temptations
[2:14:41] was for him. You know what? That the
[2:14:44] Bible say he was tempted in all points
[2:14:50] like we are
[2:14:52] yet without sin. He was tempted by
[2:14:55] drinking.
[2:14:57] He was tempted by women. He was tempted
[2:15:00] by everything
[2:15:02] to be tempted by. He was tempted by
[2:15:05] everything
[2:15:07] that we are. He was a man. And yet you
[2:15:11] could not put a mark on him.
[2:15:16] Overcome means to recognize the devil
[2:15:20] in every one of his tricks.
[2:15:25] Praise the name of you just know
[2:15:32] this one is coming like this. Let me
[2:15:34] avoid it.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of you overcome.
[2:15:40] When when Joseph saw wife
[2:15:45] said
[2:15:47] let me take off.
[2:15:50] And then there are some bold women.
[2:15:56] Why are you running women?
[2:15:58] Joseph had to run away.
[2:16:01] There are those who are bold
[2:16:04] that they can force you.
[2:16:08] Run away.
[2:16:14] [Laughter]
[2:16:22] You know you take off.
[2:16:25] You don't just
[2:16:27] no scream.
[2:16:32] Joseph had to do that.
[2:16:34] You know the devil is so tricky.
[2:16:38] Then he said lot of people say there is
[2:16:41] no devil.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; It is just a thought.
[2:16:46] Don't you believe that there is a real
[2:16:50] devil?
[2:16:52] And he's just as real as you are.
[2:16:56] Anybody, a real devil. And you must
[2:17:00] recognize him real.
[2:17:04] You must know he's a devil.
[2:17:06] At the same time that you recognize him
[2:17:10] and know that he's a devil
[2:17:12] and he is against you.
[2:17:16] Satan is not your friend
[2:17:20] and don't befriend his schemes.
[2:17:26] It's not for friendship.
[2:17:29] The Bible say the thief comes
[2:17:33] to steal.
[2:17:35] That's the devil.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; When he comes, he either has coming to
[2:17:40] steal something from you
[2:17:43] to kill
[2:17:45] or to destroy.
[2:17:48] That's what the devil does.
[2:17:51] Whenever he comes, there's something he
[2:17:53] has come to do.
[2:17:56] If he can't kill you,
[2:17:59] if he can't destroy you, he will he will
[2:18:02] steal the joy of your salvation.
[2:18:06] until you get discouraged about being a
[2:18:08] Christian.
[2:18:10] It's the devil working
[2:18:12] something he has stolen from you.
[2:18:16] So, and yet the joy of the Lord
[2:18:19] is our strength.
[2:18:21] So, what does he do? He makes you lose
[2:18:25] desire of fellowship.
[2:18:30] You don't care whether you come to
[2:18:31] church or not.
[2:18:34] He has stolen something from you. No
[2:18:37] more joy.
[2:18:39] So you are bound.
[2:18:42] You are held captive.
[2:18:45] Bound.
[2:18:47] There's something he has stolen from
[2:18:48] you. And if he knows he can do this,
[2:18:52] he goes further.
[2:18:55] He keeps on coming.
[2:18:58] If he knows he has stolen,
[2:19:01] he wants to steal more.
[2:19:03] or he wants to make sure that everything
[2:19:04] is not there.
[2:19:07] That's what the devil does. So you don't
[2:19:09] give him room anywhere.
[2:19:12] Don't give an room for Satan
[2:19:15] to open up anywhere
[2:19:17] that he may come and maybe sit in your
[2:19:21] he sits in your heart. You know, you
[2:19:24] entertain him,
[2:19:26] then you start feeding him. Don't do
[2:19:29] that. Praise the name of our Lord. See
[2:19:32] that you don't give him room.
[2:19:35] Don't give entertain him.
[2:19:39] He cannot be part of your career.
[2:19:45] Praise the name of you know bicles have
[2:19:47] careers
[2:19:54] and it's your energy to move that what
[2:19:56] you holding.
[2:19:59] Why do you load yourself with Satan?
[2:20:05] You know you are carrying a lot
[2:20:08] like those idol worshippers.
[2:20:11] They would carry their gods on their
[2:20:12] back
[2:20:15] when he reaches in this place to rest.
[2:20:19] He puts there and then starts
[2:20:23] if it can't move itself.
[2:20:31] Amen.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; You know like somebody
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; when he's going for a safari
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; you carry short dresses
[2:20:46] you know there we are going to
[2:20:49] you know then you go there and then you
[2:20:50] change
[2:20:53] you're woring
[2:20:55] you you're the same carrying idols.
[2:21:00] How we did to J?
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; You know we go there.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; We going swimming.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; But how are you going to dress?
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; How are you going to dress?
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; You know these are for swimming. I'm
[2:21:16] going to be in the water.
[2:21:18] You're carrying your your idols here.
[2:21:23] Oh, some funny things.
[2:21:26] Some secret life.
[2:21:29] secret.
[2:21:34] [Music]
[2:21:37] You know, it's a bondage.
[2:21:39] So, you need to see that you reject it.
[2:21:45] You denounce it.
[2:21:48] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[2:21:50] says, "The same time that you recognize
[2:21:53] him
[2:21:56] and know that is a devil that is against
[2:21:59] you,
[2:22:00] then to overcome,
[2:22:03] you must recognize
[2:22:06] that God in you
[2:22:10] is greater
[2:22:12] might
[2:22:13] than he.
[2:22:15] The one that's in you has already
[2:22:18] overcome.
[2:22:20] And by his grace, you are more than a
[2:22:23] match for him.
[2:22:27] That's real overcoming.
[2:22:31] You recognize,
[2:22:33] praise the name of God. So whatever
[2:22:35] darkness that is holding us,
[2:22:38] let us reject it. Whatever the devil is
[2:22:42] trying to hold us,
[2:22:45] denounce it.
[2:22:47] Put it aside. Praise the name of put
[2:22:51] away.
[2:22:53] Put off.
[2:22:57] Praise the name of God. I just come in
[2:22:59] the presence of God. I say, "Lord, I
[2:23:02] need your
[2:23:06] praise the name of our Lord. I need your
[2:23:08] victory.
[2:23:09] Praise the name of our Lord." Now, in
[2:23:11] the message, questions and answers.
[2:23:15] Brother Brham says,
[2:23:20] He says here in this message
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; paragraph 214.
[2:23:34] You are saved.
[2:23:37] I'm so glad to know that Christ saves
[2:23:39] us.
[2:23:41] But we may backslide.
[2:23:44] We may do wrong.
[2:23:46] We all have to go our ups and downs.
[2:23:51] But in your soul,
[2:23:54] as soon as you do anything,
[2:23:57] well, there is something goes wrong in
[2:23:59] you.
[2:24:02] You know it is now right in the now.
[2:24:07] Right there is the time to jump.
[2:24:11] That's the time to get
[2:24:15] get away from it.
[2:24:19] Now you say you got out here today and
[2:24:23] somebody comes to you and say, "Hey,
[2:24:27] they tell me you are one of them holy
[2:24:30] rollers
[2:24:34] right quick."
[2:24:36] Satan says, "Snap him down.
[2:24:45] I don't know about being a
[2:24:52] I am a Christian
[2:24:55] and always with and always
[2:24:59] with evil
[2:25:01] meet with good
[2:25:05] and remember now just take this remember
[2:25:09] remember this When you meet evil with
[2:25:11] good,
[2:25:14] evil cannot stand the presence of God.
[2:25:18] You cannot do it. Praise the name of our
[2:25:22] Lord. You know, somebody is abusing you.
[2:25:25] You don't abuse back. Somebody is
[2:25:27] fighting you. You don't fight back. But
[2:25:31] then the nature of Christ
[2:25:34] will come out is bringing bitterness.
[2:25:38] You bring sweetness.
[2:25:42] He's abusing you. You forgive them. Not
[2:25:46] abuse again.
[2:25:48] So you have to see that you overcome
[2:25:52] all forms of darkness
[2:25:55] in whatever when the devil comes to
[2:25:57] attack you.
[2:25:59] Praise the name of God. And then he
[2:26:01] says,
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; listen, I don't care how dark the night
[2:26:06] is.
[2:26:08] It may be so dark
[2:26:11] till you could feel it
[2:26:15] you could put your hands up like this
[2:26:19] and you couldn't see no shadow of no
[2:26:21] time.
[2:26:24] That may be the condition you are in.
[2:26:27] So dark,
[2:26:29] so in bondage.
[2:26:31] But then he says the least little bit of
[2:26:34] light
[2:26:39] will expose that darkness.
[2:26:43] Certainly that's the way life is in the
[2:26:46] presence of death.
[2:26:48] That's the way right does in the
[2:26:50] presence of wrong.
[2:26:53] That's the way faith does in the
[2:26:55] presence of doubt.
[2:26:59] it is scatters all away.
[2:27:03] So then in that kind of condition,
[2:27:07] praise the name of the Bible says in
[2:27:11] Psalms 112.
[2:27:15] Let us speak that scripture.
[2:27:18] Psalms 112
[2:27:22] and then verse four.
[2:27:25] And to the upright
[2:27:28] There arises light in the darkness.
[2:27:33] So when you are in darkness,
[2:27:36] light arises
[2:27:39] and that light comes
[2:27:42] for your deliverance
[2:27:44] for your victory that you can come out
[2:27:47] of whatever condition you are in
[2:27:51] and be made free.
[2:27:54] like the prodical son. He was living in
[2:27:57] darkness.
[2:27:58] But then light arose
[2:28:02] and he remembered his father and said,
[2:28:05] "My father has enough food."
[2:28:08] And then he resolved,
[2:28:11] "Let me go back to my father."
[2:28:14] That's the same thing we need to do. Let
[2:28:17] me reconcile with God.
[2:28:21] Whatever wrong I have done,
[2:28:24] Lord, I want to make it right.
[2:28:27] Be willing to reconcile.
[2:28:31] Be willing.
[2:28:33] Praise the name of our Lord. And don't
[2:28:35] allow
[2:28:37] darkness to keep you away.
[2:28:40] Don't allow your condition
[2:28:42] to hold you in bondage.
[2:28:45] Whatever situation you have which is not
[2:28:47] pleasing,
[2:28:48] it is darkness.
[2:28:50] And there is light here.
[2:28:53] Praise the name of our Lord. There is a
[2:28:54] man here who can turn on the light.
[2:28:58] Praise the name of our Lord. He can come
[2:29:00] down in your confession.
[2:29:03] He can come down in your stress.
[2:29:06] It doesn't matter how long you've been
[2:29:08] bound.
[2:29:10] Praise the name of our Lord. It doesn't
[2:29:12] matter the chains that have bound.
[2:29:16] There is a man who can turn on the
[2:29:17] light.
[2:29:19] Praise the name of our Lord. like the
[2:29:21] the the man who was running away from
[2:29:23] Jerusalem.
[2:29:25] Jerusalem a holy city
[2:29:28] and then he was going down to Jericho
[2:29:32] a cast city
[2:29:34] hell
[2:29:36] running from heaven going to hell and
[2:29:39] many people's lives get into that kind
[2:29:41] of condition
[2:29:44] they leave the heavenly influence
[2:29:47] and then they go down to hell influence
[2:29:51] It may be at your place of work. It may
[2:29:54] be at your home. It may be where you
[2:29:56] live. A hell conditioner.
[2:30:01] But then when this man was beaten on the
[2:30:03] road,
[2:30:06] the Bible says he was left for dead.
[2:30:11] And then the Samaritan came
[2:30:14] and had compassion. And the Lord Jesus
[2:30:17] Christ is that good Samaritan who has
[2:30:21] compassion upon you in your condition.
[2:30:25] Praise the name of Lord. He has come to
[2:30:27] deliver you in whatever condition you
[2:30:30] are in. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[2:30:33] what did the Samaritan do?
[2:30:36] He got this man. He put him on his bed
[2:30:41] and then he took him to the in.
[2:30:44] Praise the name of brother Brandham say
[2:30:48] the in is the church. We are now all of
[2:30:52] us in the in praise the name of we are
[2:30:55] in the in the good Samaritan is here and
[2:31:00] he has the inkeeper
[2:31:03] and the inkeeper
[2:31:05] is the minister. Praise the name of. And
[2:31:08] then brother Brandham says he gave the
[2:31:11] inkeeper
[2:31:15] two pens.
[2:31:17] One was the word,
[2:31:19] the other was the spirit. And then he
[2:31:22] said, "If it is not enough,
[2:31:25] I will come and bring more."
[2:31:28] Praise the name of our Lord. So we are
[2:31:30] in the inn.
[2:31:32] Praise the name of our Lord. We are in a
[2:31:35] in
[2:31:37] a hospital
[2:31:39] where we can be treated
[2:31:42] and be made whole of whatever condition
[2:31:45] we have.
[2:31:47] Praise the name of. You must believe it
[2:31:50] that this medicine will work for me.
[2:31:54] Praise the name of you. You must believe
[2:31:56] it. This doctor will treat me well. You
[2:32:02] must have faith.
[2:32:04] But if you don't have faith, however
[2:32:06] good the medicine is, however good the
[2:32:09] doctor is, it will do you no good.
[2:32:13] Praise the name of our Lord. So we are
[2:32:15] in the in
[2:32:17] let us receive the treatment
[2:32:21] and where you need
[2:32:23] Lord I ask for more.
[2:32:26] Praise the name of our Lord. I need more
[2:32:28] of your strength.
[2:32:30] I need more of your word. I need more of
[2:32:32] your deliverance.
[2:32:34] Praise the name of the Lord. So you
[2:32:36] don't allow
[2:32:38] yourself
[2:32:40] to be held in captive
[2:32:42] to be in darkness
[2:32:45] forever.
[2:32:46] Praise the name of our Lord. When
[2:32:48] there's a man who can turn on the light,
[2:32:51] praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[2:32:53] message, let me try so we can finish.
[2:32:57] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[2:32:59] forever.
[2:33:01] He says now the only thing I can do
[2:33:07] is to cast away that doubt from your
[2:33:10] heart
[2:33:11] [Music]
[2:33:16] will come out of this
[2:33:19] thing.
[2:33:21] That's doubt
[2:33:23] and that's darkness.
[2:33:25] So the thing is to get away that
[2:33:28] darkness.
[2:33:30] But what will it help you to continue
[2:33:32] doubting?
[2:33:34] Be like those lepers.
[2:33:38] There was famine in the land
[2:33:41] and they knew there was food in the
[2:33:42] Syrian.
[2:33:46] He said if we stay here,
[2:33:49] we are going to die, if we go there,
[2:33:52] they may kill us.
[2:33:54] But it's the same thing. But we go
[2:33:57] there,
[2:33:58] get what to eat and be alive. So they
[2:34:00] decided
[2:34:02] to reject their condition of famine
[2:34:05] and go where the food is. That's the
[2:34:08] same thing with us. I make a decision
[2:34:13] to reject my bondage
[2:34:16] and say, Lord,
[2:34:18] praise the name of you. Cry out, Lord,
[2:34:22] it is me. Lord, I need help.
[2:34:26] Those lepers unclean, unclean.
[2:34:32] Praise the name of Jesus. So then here
[2:34:34] he says
[2:34:36] and the doubt leaves you
[2:34:39] and you feel that there is something
[2:34:41] near you.
[2:34:43] The angels of God are in this building.
[2:34:47] You say, "Is that so, preacher?"
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The Bible said they are
[2:34:56] the angels of God
[2:34:59] encamped about those who fear.
[2:35:03] But there is a dark shadow
[2:35:07] between you and the angel
[2:35:10] that wants to help you.
[2:35:14] There's a
[2:35:16] there's a dark shadow
[2:35:19] between you and that angel
[2:35:22] that wants to help you bringing the
[2:35:26] message of Christ.
[2:35:29] That's unbelief.
[2:35:32] If you can get that unbelief,
[2:35:36] that dark shadow,
[2:35:39] then you'll see plainly.
[2:35:42] Then you rise.
[2:35:44] and rejoice and go home shouting,
[2:35:49] praising God.
[2:35:51] Get well,
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; don't let that shadow
[2:35:56] stand between you.
[2:35:58] Praise the name of our Lord. Our Lord
[2:36:00] Jesus Christ said, "Where two or three
[2:36:02] are gathered in
[2:36:05] I'll be there in their meeting." He's
[2:36:07] right here. But it is the shadow of
[2:36:10] doubt.
[2:36:13] Shadow of unbelief
[2:36:16] that makes you feel
[2:36:21] situation. No one can help me.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; Just cast away that doubt and believe
[2:36:27] Lord you are here to deliver.
[2:36:30] It says the angel
[2:36:32] has the message of Christ and the angels
[2:36:37] messengers.
[2:36:38] They are sent with sweet messages.
[2:36:42] Message of deliverance
[2:36:44] like the angel who came to the prison
[2:36:46] where Peter was bound
[2:36:50] to the chains were broken. Even now
[2:36:54] whatever chain you are in
[2:36:56] can be broken in the name of the Lord.
[2:37:00] You just believe it. This habit has
[2:37:02] bound me for so long.
[2:37:05] I've been in this for so long.
[2:37:08] I want to be released.
[2:37:10] Praise the name of God. I want to be
[2:37:12] delivered this morning.
[2:37:15] Praise the name of Lord. You just
[2:37:17] believe.
[2:37:18] Lord, I need your deliverance.
[2:37:22] Praise the name of our Lord. In whatever
[2:37:24] condition,
[2:37:25] the Lord is here to deliver.
[2:37:28] Praise the name of our Lord. May God
[2:37:29] bless you.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; Let us sing that song.
[2:37:40] Pass me not oriental savior. Let us
[2:37:42] stand up. Let the song leader come. Just
[2:37:45] believe it. Take time and talk to the
[2:37:48] Lord.
[2:37:50] Lord, don't pass me like Zakayas
[2:37:54] bound in all kind of evil.
[2:37:58] The Lord went his way. The woman at the
[2:38:01] well, the prostitute,
[2:38:04] Jesus passed by her.
[2:38:07] The same thing now. Jesus is passing
[2:38:10] your way. He want to set you free.
[2:38:14] Just believe it with all your heart.
[2:38:17] Lord, deliver me out of this darkness.
[2:38:20] Lord, deliver me out of this bondage.
[2:38:23] Praise the name of
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; Pass me not
[2:38:34] hear
[2:38:36] my humble
[2:38:39] cry.
[2:38:40] [Music]
[2:38:43] Oh why
[2:38:46] not thou art go
[2:38:50] my savior do
[2:38:54] not pass me by call the savior
[2:39:01] savior
[2:39:05] oh savior
[2:39:12] I have
[2:39:15] cry.
[2:39:20] Why
[2:39:23] are thou art?
[2:39:27] Holy my savior do
[2:39:32] not pass me by.
[2:39:36] Let me at thy throne of mercy.
[2:39:41] me at thy throne
[2:39:51] as sweet
[2:39:54] [Laughter]
[2:40:02] in the country.
[2:40:07] Hallelujah. I am
[2:40:11] my
[2:40:27] humble cry. Hear my humble.
[2:40:35] When I seek thy face,
[2:40:39] I seek thy face.
[2:40:44] Heal my wound and broken spirit.
[2:40:47] Heal
[2:40:49] my wounded broken spir and save me by
[2:40:54] thy grace. Lord, save
[2:40:59] me.
[2:41:01] [Music]
[2:41:04] I see.
[2:41:08] Savior. Savior.
[2:41:14] Here I am.
[2:41:19] I am
[2:41:24] not going.
[2:41:31] I
[2:41:35] my savior do
[2:41:38] no
[2:41:40] He
[2:41:49] knowch.
[2:41:52] [Music]
[2:42:16] [Music]
[2:42:18] Oh, good
[2:42:22] s.
[2:42:36] You
[2:42:37] come
[2:42:44] [Laughter]
[2:42:50] down.
[2:42:58] [Music]
[2:43:00] Yes.
[2:43:03] [Music]
[2:43:13] Oh,
[2:43:32] oh,
[2:43:36] [Music]
[2:43:41] Moore
[2:43:50] [Music]
[2:43:57] [Music]
[2:44:02] Zech.
[2:44:10] [Music]
[2:44:13] Just open up your heart
[2:44:16] like that prodigal son. Every one of us
[2:44:19] knows where you have fallen. Speak to
[2:44:21] the master. Say, "Lord,
[2:44:24] I'm bringing myself, Lord, my body, my
[2:44:28] soul." You said in your word that we
[2:44:32] present our bodies as a living
[2:44:34] sacrifice,
[2:44:35] holy and acceptable before thee.
[2:44:41] Like David, we are born and shaped in
[2:44:43] iniquity.
[2:44:45] Like Paul says, the things we desire to
[2:44:48] do, we do not. And the things we don't
[2:44:52] want to do are the things we do
[2:44:56] because you have mercy and compassion.
[2:44:59] Oh Lord, your light is shining. Oh
[2:45:02] heavenly father in our areas of
[2:45:04] darkness. Oh king of glory. Won't you be
[2:45:07] gracious oh heavenly father to forgive.
[2:45:10] Oh Lord. Father we are bound by
[2:45:13] different chains. Oh Lord. We are bound
[2:45:15] by different circumstances Lord. Some
[2:45:18] might be battling drugs. Some might be
[2:45:20] battling adultery, Lord. Some might be
[2:45:23] battling pornography. Some might be
[2:45:26] battling every different kind of spirit,
[2:45:28] Lord. But we are so thankful, oh
[2:45:31] heavenly father, because when we desire
[2:45:34] deep down in our hearts, Lord, when we
[2:45:36] confess our faults, oh Lord, you said,
[2:45:39] "If my people who are called by name
[2:45:42] shall humble themselves shall seek my
[2:45:45] face and turn away from their wicked
[2:45:48] ways." Father this afternoon we are
[2:45:51] turning away Lord from all wickedness.
[2:45:54] Lord we are saying heavenly father like
[2:45:56] the prodigy son we have wandered far
[2:45:59] from the fold. Lord you have mercy upon
[2:46:02] us. Like blinders Lord we are crying. Oh
[2:46:06] son of David have mercy upon. Father I
[2:46:10] do not desire to live this way. I do not
[2:46:13] desire to walk in a life of sin. But
[2:46:16] like Paul says, the sin that easily
[2:46:19] beset sacked, Father, holding on to us,
[2:46:24] we pray by the grace of God, Father,
[2:46:26] that you may deliver your children. Like
[2:46:29] that quoting
[2:46:33] out, Brother Borders, you God is setting
[2:46:37] his children free. God is breaking every
[2:46:40] chain. Father, as we cry out this
[2:46:43] afternoon, oh Lord, may you break the
[2:46:46] chains, oh heavenly father, that the
[2:46:48] enemy, oh Lord, has tied your children
[2:46:52] long upon, oh father, have mercy and
[2:46:55] compassion upon them. Lord, we are
[2:46:57] crying out, oh heavenly father, this
[2:47:00] afternoon. Oh Lord, as you're setting
[2:47:02] free, oh Lord, you are crying out,
[2:47:05] brother Borders, cry out to the master.
[2:47:08] He's here to set you free. Oh father,
[2:47:11] will you be gracious Lord? Every chain
[2:47:14] of circumstance Lord. Some are genetical
[2:47:17] spirits. Oh Lord, some are cultural
[2:47:20] spirits. Oh heavenly father, we do not
[2:47:22] desire to walk in them. Oh Lord, will
[2:47:25] your mercies be shed upon us, oh father,
[2:47:28] and give us the light, oh Lord, the
[2:47:31] light of your word, oh king of glory, to
[2:47:34] help us, oh heavenly father, overcome,
[2:47:36] Lord, every power of darkness, oh Lord,
[2:47:39] because you said in your word that
[2:47:42] whoever is in Christ overcomes the
[2:47:44] world. Father, would you help us, Lord,
[2:47:47] that that overcoming power, oh God, may
[2:47:51] live in our lives, Lord, overcoming in
[2:47:54] our homes, oh Lord, overcoming in our
[2:47:56] neighborhoods, oh Father, overcoming at
[2:47:59] our places of work, oh Lord, we desire
[2:48:02] that overcoming power, oh Lord, how we
[2:48:06] love you, oh Lord,
[2:48:08] we
[2:48:12] [Music]
[2:48:14] just continue to speak to him in your
[2:48:16] own way.
[2:48:21] [Music]
[2:48:37] Hallelujah.
