[22:18] Grace amen amen so let's down to the
[22:21] Book of
[22:23] Genesis
[22:25] 2se 23
[22:29] and then after that we shall turn to
[22:33] Malachi
[22:35] one and finally we shall read Romans
[22:38] chapter
[22:40] 9 the Bible says in Genesis
[22:47] 25:23 and the Lord said unto
[22:52] her two nations are in thy womb and the
[22:55] two manner of people shall be separated
[22:59] from thy bowels and the one people shall
[23:02] be stronger than the other and the Elder
[23:05] Shall Serve the
[23:24] younger Malachi chapter 1 verse 23
[23:33] I have loved you says the Lord yet ye
[23:37] say wherein hast thou loved us was not
[23:42] Esau's was not Esau Jacob's brother says
[23:45] the Lord yet I loved Jacob and I hated
[23:49] Esau and laid his mountains on his
[23:52] Heritage on his Heritage waste for the
[23:55] dragons of the wilderness
[24:26] Romans chapter 9:3
[24:32] as it is written Jacob have I loved
[24:45] and may the Lord bless his word we may
[24:47] get
[24:50] seated praise the Lord so the scriptures
[24:53] that we have
[24:55] read
[24:57] speak praise the Lord they speak about
[25:01] Jacob and
[25:03] Es and we see the mind of God towards
[25:06] the
[25:08] two he said unto
[25:11] Rebecca that you you have two nations in
[25:16] wom and two man of
[25:21] people one people shall be stronger than
[25:23] the
[25:26] other and the purpose of God
[25:30] here the thought of God was that the
[25:34] Elder Shall Serve
[25:37] the and he
[25:40] says that Jacob have I
[25:44] loved and I have hated
[25:47] es praise the Lord so now we
[25:50] notice that when
[25:53] God blessed
[25:55] Isaac with children
[25:59] praise the Lord and now he says there
[26:01] were two Nations that were in the womb
[26:03] of Rebecca his
[26:07] wife and there were two sons so there
[26:10] was ISAC there was es and
[26:14] Jacob and Jacob was the
[26:17] younger and Es was the
[26:20] Elder and we know the principle of
[26:24] inheritance is that the Elder
[26:28] praise the Lord in most cases the
[26:30] principle is that the Elder
[26:34] son becomes
[26:36] here but now here God was changing the
[26:41] principle and he said that the
[26:44] Elder shall instead serve
[26:48] theer in other words
[26:51] theer take
[26:55] possession take
[26:57] control The
[26:59] Inheritance and now the the
[27:02] younger would be the one that would rule
[27:05] over the
[27:07] Elder and now when the two children were
[27:10] born he see that they were
[27:12] blessed and know that
[27:15] Isaac loved so much
[27:18] is because is was a hun he was a
[27:24] field he used to go
[27:27] hunting and he could come with
[27:29] animals and he would Slaughter and now
[27:33] he would prepare for his
[27:35] father and his father was an old
[27:38] man and he loved eating the
[27:40] animals he loved the sweet
[27:46] sver used to come out of them so now
[27:49] when he had grown
[27:51] old praise the Lord he called his son es
[27:56] because ES
[27:58] by
[28:00] default was the one that would be the
[28:03] Elder that would be the
[28:06] hair that was the plan of
[28:09] Isaac praise the Lord and so he called
[28:12] him and says go and kill me an
[28:17] animal go hunt and prepare for me and
[28:21] then bring before me so I may eat and
[28:25] then I will bless you praise the Lord
[28:28] that was the mind that he had he wanted
[28:31] to bless his
[28:33] son over his
[28:36] possession but that was not the plan of
[28:39] God the Eternal purpose of
[28:42] God what was in the thoughts of
[28:45] God was that it had to be
[28:49] Jacob to take the
[28:51] inheritance and that
[28:54] es had to serve Jacob
[28:58] so now when the father
[29:00] called the mother had and now when the
[29:04] mother had now the mother was in the
[29:07] mind of
[29:08] God because God had spoken to
[29:11] her when she was still
[29:14] pregnant and she says you have two
[29:17] Nations two fighting
[29:20] Nations those two
[29:22] Nations they are made of two
[29:25] people those two sons
[29:28] in your wom take it that the
[29:32] younger praise the Lord will have
[29:35] control over
[29:36] the and so the Elder Shall Serve
[29:40] theer when came to her
[29:43] notice when came to her
[29:45] notice that
[29:47] now the father wanted to bless
[29:51] is and remember along the was were
[29:55] growing at some point of time es sold
[29:59] his
[30:01] birth praise the Lord and that was all
[30:04] the purpose of
[30:06] God sell his
[30:08] birth now when
[30:11] Rebecca she had to do
[30:13] something in order to make
[30:17] Jacob the rightful
[30:20] owner the inheritance of their
[30:24] father praise the Lord and now she was
[30:28] exactly doing the mind of
[30:32] God while Isaac's
[30:35] mind was to
[30:39] have the mind of God was to
[30:43] have Jacob beh over the inheritance of
[30:50] Isaac so we now see that they
[30:55] upbringing and their destiny
[30:59] was
[31:00] pre it was known even before they were
[31:04] born whatever they would
[31:07] own whatever life they would
[31:09] live was planned by God before they were
[31:12] even
[31:14] born praise the Lord so now we see that
[31:17] God makes the
[31:19] election praise the Lord who we are to
[31:23] be even before we are born into this
[31:26] world
[31:28] praise the Lord so now when we come into
[31:30] this world we come to walk according to
[31:34] the patterns of
[31:36] God so now we see that
[31:40] Jacob the
[31:42] mother praise the Lord sent him and they
[31:46] did something which appear to be
[31:49] changing
[31:52] ownership changing the
[31:55] hair that was the purpose of God
[31:59] they were even
[32:01] born praise the Lord and now for
[32:04] foundation be taking a
[32:08] tonight on the Eternal purpose of
[32:12] election praise the Lord
[32:15] election is an eternal
[32:18] thought an eternal purpose of
[32:22] God praise the Lord I want us to take
[32:25] our
[32:26] picture from the birth of es and
[32:30] Jacob and how their lives would
[32:33] be and how their lives were pre-planned
[32:38] how their lives were
[32:40] predetermined and much as they fought
[32:43] against each
[32:44] other God knew
[32:47] exactly how each one of them would
[32:50] be praise the Lord God had
[32:53] chosen Jacob even before he was born
[32:58] and does not mean that es was a bad
[33:02] man was a good man praise the Lord
[33:06] that's why his father loved him we know
[33:09] the saying that a bad son praise the
[33:13] Lord is not like of the
[33:16] father praise the Lord and if you have a
[33:19] bad son is an African
[33:22] saying praise the Lord that a bad son
[33:26] always make the mother to be abused
[33:29] But A Good Son always beloved of the
[33:33] father but we see that was loved of his
[33:38] father he was a good man he was very
[33:42] kind praise the Lord was very
[33:45] forgiving that's why even when Jacob
[33:47] came
[33:48] back after Jacob had taken over the
[33:53] inheritance but now when he came
[33:56] back still for for
[33:58] him so he was a good man so now the
[34:02] choice of God was not
[34:05] determined by how good each of the two
[34:08] sons would
[34:10] be praise the Lord the choosing of God
[34:14] praise the Lord is his own
[34:17] choice praise the Lord and he makes a
[34:20] choice depending on his eternal
[34:23] purpose praise the Lord depending on his
[34:27] Eternal Soul
[34:31] etal they were even
[34:33] born had chosen that Jacob regardless of
[34:38] his personal
[34:40] weaknesses regardless of his personal
[34:44] failures to be
[34:46] Jacob chose praise the Lord it to be
[34:50] Jacob out of him would come a
[34:54] nation that out of him become the people
[34:58] of God not because he was good but it
[35:03] was according to the purpose of
[35:05] God praise the Living God and I want say
[35:10] something the prophet say something
[35:12] about
[35:14] teaching praise the Lord he says that
[35:19] teaching positionally
[35:22] places the
[35:24] church into her position
[35:28] I'm trying to paraphrase
[35:30] it praise the Lord teaching teaching the
[35:34] word the pastor was teaching us last
[35:37] Sunday about obtaining
[35:40] favor praise the Lord and then he made a
[35:44] quation a church that is Tau
[35:48] right a church that know supposition in
[35:51] the
[35:52] world praise the Lord regardless of the
[35:55] storms
[35:57] she shall be
[35:59] grounded because she knows her
[36:03] position when the Ang of the Lord Vis
[36:07] Rebecca he told her of what the things
[36:11] would be she had been given the
[36:14] information she had been
[36:17] Tau of what would become of her
[36:20] sons so whatever was taking place she
[36:23] had known her
[36:25] position that's why when she saw that
[36:29] was trying to take the
[36:32] position she fought so hard to make
[36:36] sure she fought so hard to make sure
[36:40] that the Eternal purpose of
[36:43] God be
[36:45] established so she called Jacob and told
[36:48] him and says go and do this make sure
[36:52] you do it right and when he did it right
[36:56] he found himself
[36:58] in the position of leadership the
[37:01] position of a ha and he became the
[37:04] ha praise the Lord and now I will be
[37:08] teaching this subject
[37:11] tonight
[37:12] election seeing the Eternal purpose of
[37:16] God want see the Eternal purpose of
[37:21] election how is the church
[37:24] elected how do we find ourselves in the
[37:27] world
[37:29] how we find ourselves in the
[37:31] message why is it that we have been
[37:34] separated how is it that we have been
[37:37] obedient praise the Lord how is it that
[37:40] we are here and we are taking go at his
[37:44] word how is it that we are here and we
[37:47] are only taking the
[37:50] word not
[37:52] chasing after the worldly
[37:54] pleasures after the riches and the rest
[37:58] of them praise the Lord and now once we
[38:02] get the mind of
[38:04] election we shall take our rest for we
[38:08] shall know that election has nothing to
[38:12] do who we are praise the Lord but it is
[38:16] the Eternal thought of
[38:19] God and the prophet says in the message
[38:25] adoption 1960
[38:28] paragraph six
[38:30] says Bible teaching is usually a little
[38:36] trous a little you
[38:38] know kind kind of walking out of on the
[38:42] thin
[38:46] ice we just feel that
[38:49] maybe at this point and at this time it
[38:53] might be good kind of bring the church
[39:05] complete
[39:07] understanding
[39:09] positionally of what we are in Christ
[39:12] Jesus and sometimes I think that
[39:16] preaching is a wonderful
[39:17] thing but I believe
[39:20] sometimes
[39:22] brother that teaching goes beyond
[39:26] that ESP to the church now preaching
[39:30] usually catches
[39:33] the brings him
[39:35] underation by the word but teaching
[39:39] places the
[39:40] man positionally what he
[39:43] is and what and we can never rightly be
[39:48] able to have faith until
[39:53] positionally we know what we are
[39:57] praise the
[39:58] Lord so until we positionally know what
[40:01] we
[40:03] are the prophet says we can never have
[40:09] faith enough to
[40:10] [Music]
[40:12] believe enough to
[40:14] stand praise the Lord just like the
[40:17] pastor preached last
[40:19] Sunday when we are
[40:21] Tau and we know our position in
[40:25] Christ praise the Lord when we know our
[40:28] position in
[40:29] Christ we then become
[40:32] grounded praise the Lord and that
[40:35] settles it so no matter the waves that
[40:38] shall
[40:40] come praise the lord we know we are
[40:43] anchored in the
[40:44] word and when the waves come our faith
[40:48] is anchored on the word of
[40:51] God the Lord so when the church is to
[40:55] right it positions them in the
[41:00] word so now going back to
[41:03] election God shows us before the
[41:07] foundation of the
[41:08] world that's what the Bible says it says
[41:12] in the book of
[41:14] Deuteronomy
[41:15] 7
[41:17] verse and thou a holy
[41:21] people the Lord thy God the Lord thy God
[41:25] has chosen thee
[41:28] to be a special people and to
[41:31] himself above all people that are upon
[41:34] the face of the
[41:36] earth that is it he says he has chosen
[41:40] us to be a special
[41:44] people
[41:46] Israel chosen people of
[41:48] God prise the Lord above all the people
[41:52] upon the face of the
[41:54] Earth praise the Lord and to us has
[41:57] chosen Us by his word to be special
[42:02] people above all people upon the
[42:05] Earth praise the Lord and why has he
[42:08] chosen us he has chosen us because we
[42:13] were in
[42:15] him before the foundations of the
[42:18] world praise the lord we were in the
[42:21] thoughts of
[42:22] God in the mind of
[42:25] God praise the Lord before the
[42:27] foundation of the
[42:29] world what the mind of God
[42:32] was it never changes because God never
[42:36] changes his
[42:38] mind the thoughts of God you
[42:42] un a bright it shall never change praise
[42:47] the Lord regardless of how the world
[42:49] beats
[42:50] you if you in the mind of God you are in
[42:54] the mind of God and the thoughts of God
[42:59] as the bride of Christ it has to come to
[43:02] pass praise the Lord so we in the mind
[43:05] of God and that was the thought of
[43:08] God regardless of how
[43:13] crazy how
[43:15] crazy Jacob
[43:18] looked that was the mind of
[43:21] God that he had to be the
[43:26] leader Mind Of God had to be
[43:29] expressed and Jacob had to take over the
[43:35] inheritance had to Ser
[43:38] Jacob that was the word of God nobody
[43:41] could change
[43:43] it when came
[43:46] first had already
[43:49] chosen praise the Lord and loved him and
[43:53] it is
[43:54] Jacob that had to produce the 12
[43:57] children of
[43:59] Israel praise the Living God that was
[44:02] the mind of God could not change so now
[44:06] if you are the
[44:07] word that was the thought of
[44:10] God Creation with which God created the
[44:15] universe with which God created
[44:18] everything praise the Lord if we were in
[44:21] the mind of
[44:23] God became expressed in his word
[44:27] when he created
[44:29] everything praise the Lord and now if
[44:32] God in his mind he purposed that there
[44:37] is going to be a
[44:38] bright sure there has to be a
[44:41] bright praise the Lord his word has to
[44:45] be
[44:47] expressed praise the lord we are simply
[44:50] walking in the
[44:53] footprint we simply walking in the
[44:55] pattern
[44:57] we are simply walking in the
[45:01] predestination simply walking in the pre
[45:03] plans of
[45:05] God your life my life was known before
[45:11] God known by God the foundation of the
[45:16] world was known by God before we were
[45:19] even
[45:21] born praise the Lord Jacob have I loved
[45:25] and Es have I hat
[45:27] before they AB he had made a choice of
[45:31] who he would love and who he would hate
[45:35] praise the Lord before we were even born
[45:38] you made a choice that I would love you
[45:42] and you would be my people praise the
[45:44] Lord that you would serve
[45:47] him and even before you were
[45:51] born
[45:52] chose he chose you that you would serve
[45:56] him
[45:57] still you serve him the Lord regardless
[46:01] of how far you can
[46:03] run God has
[46:05] chosen in his mind before the foundation
[46:07] of the
[46:09] world this place and serve him in this
[46:13] place the word of God has to be
[46:17] established because his word never
[46:20] fails and his mind never
[46:24] changes John 15
[46:27] verse six
[46:28] says you have not chosen me I have
[46:33] chosen you
[46:36] election praise the Lord he chose us he
[46:39] says you have not chosen me but I have
[46:43] chosen you so now where are the good
[46:46] works praise the Lord he has not chosen
[46:50] us because of the good
[46:52] works no sir he has chosen us because
[46:57] he loved us the foundation of the
[47:00] world says and I have ordained
[47:03] you and you should
[47:06] go and bring forth fruit and your fruit
[47:11] should
[47:12] remain and now because he has chosen
[47:15] us and now because he has Loved
[47:18] Us Praise the Lord and now he has given
[47:21] us his words he says now because I have
[47:26] chosen you
[47:27] and I have loved you and you have also
[47:30] loved my
[47:31] wife whatsoever you shall
[47:35] ask the father in my
[47:37] name he may give it to you praise the
[47:41] Lord so now we have the
[47:43] Liberty to ask him of anything why
[47:48] because himself he chose us and brought
[47:53] us the knowledge of his
[47:55] word praise the Lord he chose us by
[47:59] himself and he brought us to the
[48:01] leadership by the words and now that he
[48:04] has placed Us in his
[48:07] wife by election by for knowledge by
[48:12] predestination then he says when you are
[48:14] here and you know your
[48:17] position you will ask of
[48:20] anything and whatever you shall
[48:22] ask in the father's name in the name of
[48:26] Jesus
[48:28] it shall be given unto you Romans 8
[48:32] verse
[48:33] 29 for whom he did
[48:37] for he also did predestinate to be
[48:41] conformed to the image of his son that
[48:45] he might be the firstborn among men
[48:47] brethren
[49:10] us Lord he knew us by
[49:14] name he knew us even before we were
[49:17] born and he says for he for them who he
[49:21] did
[49:23] for he also predestinated
[49:26] to be
[49:28] conformed to the image of his
[49:30] son praise the Lord now because he for
[49:34] us now he chooses us because the new us
[49:40] he calls us because the new he prepares
[49:44] us by his
[49:45] words to conform us to make us praise
[49:51] the Lord to change us to look like him
[49:56] form Us Praise the Lord to be conformed
[50:00] to the image of his
[50:02] son praise the Lord and he's not
[50:05] conforming
[50:06] any except for new you and he's not
[50:11] choosing you except new you praise the
[50:15] Lord and you can't be you cannot be
[50:18] conformed to the image of his
[50:21] son unless he for you and how did he for
[50:25] you
[50:27] because we were in the mind of
[50:30] him before the foundation of the
[50:33] world praise the Lord and he says in
[50:36] Ephesians 1
[50:39] verse4 according as he has chosen Us in
[50:42] him before the foundation of the world
[50:46] he has known Us Praise the Lord God knew
[50:51] us knew
[50:54] you the foundation of the world
[50:58] you look at yourself and say me this
[51:02] person who I am no God cannot
[51:06] for impossible he says he for
[51:10] you the foundation of the
[51:12] world the lord he saw you the person who
[51:17] you would
[51:18] become and now because of that after he
[51:22] has forn you he says now I'll come and
[51:26] choose
[51:27] you I myself and God himself says he
[51:33] predestinated us and then he conforms
[51:37] us onto the image of his
[51:40] son praise the Lord he conforms
[51:43] us
[51:45] righte he conforms us the St of a
[51:50] perfect man he conforms us into the
[51:54] perfect image of the bride of Christ
[51:58] praise the Lord so the entire
[52:01] story of
[52:03] election story of
[52:06] election is all for
[52:09] God has
[52:11] nothing with our personal efforts it has
[52:15] nothing with our abilities it has
[52:19] nothing our poers it is all by God and
[52:24] for God praise the Lord according as he
[52:27] has chosen Us in him before the
[52:29] foundation of the world that we should
[52:32] be
[52:35] holy praise the Lord he knew us before
[52:38] the foundation of the
[52:39] world we should be
[52:43] holy and Without
[52:45] Blame
[52:47] before but now we look at our
[52:50] failures and said but how can I be
[52:53] holy your holiness
[52:56] dependent on your
[52:58] failures your Holiness it is because God
[53:03] shows you an
[53:05] purpose that you should be holy before
[53:09] him in love and how can he make you
[53:12] holy praise the Lord now when we fell
[53:17] and R short of
[53:19] grace before the foundation of the
[53:22] world God prepared himself a l
[53:26] it was all
[53:28] predestinated before the foundation of
[53:30] the world you known before the
[53:33] foundation of the world
[53:36] chosen of the world holy and be
[53:41] conformed the image of his
[53:44] son when he saw that there would be
[53:48] failure there would be
[53:50] weaknesses before the of the world
[53:54] before even the world was formed he
[53:56] prepared himself a
[53:59] lamb prise the Lord and he offered a
[54:02] lamb for your he offer the lamb
[54:07] weaknesses praise the Lord And now when
[54:09] he offered the lamb as a
[54:11] sacrifice remember it was before the
[54:15] found then when he
[54:18] looked at us and our weaknesses and
[54:22] failures then he presented the lamb
[54:25] there
[54:26] he presented the blood there through the
[54:30] blood We Are Holy without any
[54:35] blame praise the Lord so now we cast our
[54:39] our
[54:40] failures cast them into the blood of Jes
[54:44] where we cast our
[54:45] weaknesses we cast our
[54:48] weaknesses the blood of Jesus
[54:50] Christ and that makes us a holy
[54:53] people because that is the eternal
[54:57] God he conforms us and he makes out of
[55:01] us a church that is Holy without without
[55:05] blame before
[55:07] him having predestinated us the adoption
[55:11] of children by Christ
[55:12] Jes to himself according to the good
[55:18] pleasure of his will is by his own will
[55:23] praise the Lord it is by his will
[55:27] that each of us comes to
[55:30] knowledge of the truth praise the Lord
[55:33] it is by his own
[55:37] pleasure of his own
[55:39] will that each of us is
[55:42] called into Christ
[55:45] Jesus to be to the to the praise of the
[55:49] glory of his
[55:51] grace where he has made us accepted in
[55:54] the blood
[55:58] in whom we have
[55:59] Redemption through the through his
[56:04] blood now remember the
[56:07] lamb was
[56:09] slain before the
[56:11] foundation of the world do you believe
[56:15] that yes sir that's what says and now
[56:19] because of sin when we
[56:22] Sinn God had to make the expression
[56:28] of what was in his
[56:30] mind the of the world when he offered
[56:34] the
[56:35] lamb the Lord so to offer Jesus
[56:39] Christ as a lamb die for
[56:43] our as the physical
[56:46] manifestation as the physical
[56:48] expression of that which was in the mind
[56:52] of God as an atonement for our sins
[56:57] and now he says after now he has given
[56:59] up the lamb upon the cross we now have
[57:05] Redemption we have the Forgiveness of
[57:08] sins through his blood praise the lord
[57:12] we have
[57:13] victory over our personal
[57:16] weaknesses through his blood the blood
[57:19] of Jesus Christ is what Aton for our
[57:24] sins having made know
[57:27] unto us the mystery of his
[57:29] will verse
[57:42] 9 according to his good
[57:45] pleasure which he
[57:48] hased in
[57:49] himself everything about us is because
[57:53] God purposed
[57:54] it in him
[57:57] praise the Lord everything about you is
[58:00] because God planned it because God did
[58:03] it for
[58:04] you before the foundation of the
[58:07] world praise the Lord so now we are the
[58:11] Bride of Jesus Christ not because we
[58:15] joined the
[58:17] church not because we joined in
[58:21] Tabernacle not because we have good
[58:25] manners not because we were good people
[58:29] in the
[58:30] denominations and God chose us there are
[58:33] good people
[58:34] there good
[58:36] character but God left them and he chose
[58:40] you because you are in the mind of
[58:43] God the foundation of the
[58:46] world is all by
[58:49] election you are in the word because of
[58:52] election you are a Believer because of
[58:54] election
[58:57] because of
[58:58] election and you are being
[59:00] conformed to the image of his
[59:03] son by
[59:05] election praise the Lord not because we
[59:09] are
[59:10] good because we were with
[59:12] him in his mind when the spirit of the
[59:17] Lord moved upon the face of the
[59:20] waters you were with him praise the Lord
[59:24] and when he says oh it is good that I
[59:28] separate the water praise the Lord from
[59:32] the land you in his mind the Lord And
[59:36] now when he came and said now I have
[59:38] separated the land from the waters and
[59:42] he says me
[59:45] separate from the you in his mind when
[59:50] he says let
[59:52] be it was in his mind the Lord because
[59:57] darkness
[59:58] and were in the mind of
[1:00:01] God and
[1:00:03] water in the mind of and now when they
[1:00:06] all mixed up he saw them and then he
[1:00:10] says let my mind become my word and let
[1:00:15] my word be expressed and now his mind
[1:00:19] his s came expressed when he say Let
[1:00:24] There be and it was
[1:00:27] that was in his thought and now his
[1:00:29] thought was being
[1:00:31] expressed prise the Lord we were in the
[1:00:33] mind of God and now we become the
[1:00:37] expression of the mind of God in The
[1:00:41] Bride of Jesus
[1:00:43] Christ because he says he has to have a
[1:00:47] bride there has to be a
[1:00:50] bride because there has to be a
[1:00:53] rupture is been a rupture
[1:00:56] what is to be in the rupture there has
[1:00:58] to be a in the
[1:01:01] rupture Lord and the rupture in the mind
[1:01:05] of God the punish of the
[1:01:08] world is to make up the
[1:01:10] Rapture there has to be a bright praise
[1:01:13] the Lord there has be an
[1:01:16] expression of the word of God is the
[1:01:20] Bride of Jesus Christ so we were in the
[1:01:23] mind of Christ and now we are the
[1:01:27] of the mind of God for our day because
[1:01:31] it says in the evening
[1:01:33] time praise the Lord there has to be
[1:01:36] light you are the
[1:01:38] light say we are the light of the world
[1:01:42] and the Bible says in the evening time
[1:01:45] it shall be light where is that light
[1:01:48] you that light I am that light the
[1:01:53] expression of the thoughts of God
[1:01:56] praise the Living God so now you are who
[1:01:59] you are the elect of
[1:02:02] God by for knowledge
[1:02:06] predestination because you were known in
[1:02:09] the mind of God before you did
[1:02:13] exist praise the Lord and now the
[1:02:18] plan of has to be
[1:02:21] established regardless of the Fall
[1:02:26] when the fall was there the purpose of
[1:02:30] God had to be
[1:02:33] established praise the Lord that's why
[1:02:36] God had to choose
[1:02:39] Abraham praise the Lord Abraham was
[1:02:42] living with his
[1:02:44] family his people and they were
[1:02:46] worshiping other
[1:02:48] God but God had seen
[1:02:51] Abraham and out of
[1:02:53] Abraham there had be there had to come
[1:02:56] God's
[1:02:57] people there had to come the nation
[1:03:00] Israel praise the Lord and now God came
[1:03:03] to him and called him and said
[1:03:07] Abraham come here how did Abraham
[1:03:11] recognize the
[1:03:12] voice because
[1:03:14] Abraham at one
[1:03:17] moment was part of that
[1:03:19] voice prise The Lord At One Moment
[1:03:23] Abraham was in the mind of God
[1:03:27] part of the word so even if he had
[1:03:30] gotten
[1:03:31] lost when he heard the voice the voice
[1:03:35] sounded
[1:03:37] familiarise the Lord God him you come he
[1:03:43] didn't know where he was going but
[1:03:45] because he had a
[1:03:46] voice he knew he was
[1:03:50] home the voice was speaking
[1:03:53] peace The Voice spoke peace over his
[1:03:57] life The Voice spoke life over his
[1:04:02] life spoke life praise the Lord and he
[1:04:06] was an old man and when he had a voice
[1:04:10] he could not help it but he followed the
[1:04:14] voice why because my sheep know my
[1:04:19] voice when I called say hear my
[1:04:23] voice my sheep know my
[1:04:27] because you are part of
[1:04:29] him in the mind of
[1:04:31] God of the
[1:04:33] world we heard his
[1:04:35] voice were able
[1:04:37] toize that this is the voice of the
[1:04:40] master without
[1:04:43] contention without
[1:04:45] arguments each of us followed the
[1:04:48] voice not because we had much knowledge
[1:04:52] of no sir because we were part of the
[1:04:57] we are born into
[1:04:59] this and the voice is simply aling
[1:05:04] us simply aligning us to the Eternal
[1:05:09] purpose of
[1:05:10] God praise God so now the bride simply
[1:05:16] walks
[1:05:17] right into her
[1:05:20] position by The
[1:05:22] Voice praise the Lord because this voice
[1:05:26] is the same
[1:05:27] voice which the world was
[1:05:31] created praise the Lord is the same
[1:05:34] voice with which and by which everything
[1:05:39] came into
[1:05:40] existence praise the Living God and now
[1:05:44] we notice that when we recogize this
[1:05:48] voice and we come into this
[1:05:51] voice in Union with this voice
[1:05:55] when God
[1:05:56] created he created
[1:05:59] Adam to go out and replenish the the
[1:06:03] world and F the Earth and have
[1:06:08] dominion and have
[1:06:10] control everything in the
[1:06:12] Earth was
[1:06:15] subjectto
[1:06:17] him because in him was that
[1:06:23] word was the power of God
[1:06:26] in him was ability to have
[1:06:30] dominion so when he came before the
[1:06:33] Lions the Lions P
[1:06:37] leverence when he came before the
[1:06:39] cheaters and all those fearce
[1:06:43] animals subject unto him there was no
[1:06:47] fear in the life of of
[1:06:50] Adam because the power of God rested in
[1:06:56] and we know that we are moving
[1:07:00] back that which we
[1:07:03] lost the word of God is calling us back
[1:07:08] to inherit to get back our
[1:07:11] possession which Satan had stolen from
[1:07:14] us that's why when the man of God when
[1:07:19] the man of
[1:07:21] God when he had come into the mind of
[1:07:24] God had come to the thought of
[1:07:27] God come to the power of God one time
[1:07:31] when he was moving that's in the message
[1:07:35] when love when when love
[1:07:38] projects Sovereign Grace takes over he
[1:07:42] said was going somewhere then he he took
[1:07:45] a
[1:07:46] shortcut to go pray for
[1:07:49] someone shortcut was a fierce
[1:07:53] animal was a bull
[1:07:56] was so giant that it had killed so many
[1:08:00] people en crushed on his
[1:08:04] territory he he was
[1:08:06] killed then the prophet finds
[1:08:09] himself in the territory of this
[1:08:13] bu and then he was
[1:08:15] aright but then he
[1:08:18] remembers praise the Lord that he had
[1:08:21] been
[1:08:23] reconciled to that position
[1:08:26] which Adam had
[1:08:28] lost prise the Lord he
[1:08:31] recognized that he had been
[1:08:33] reconciled the position that man had
[1:08:37] lost
[1:08:39] the then he spoke to him and says I have
[1:08:43] no I have I don't have any problem with
[1:08:45] you but then remember I was created to
[1:08:50] have
[1:08:51] dominion I was created to rule over the
[1:08:55] Earth
[1:08:56] everything has be
[1:08:58] subject because in me is the word of
[1:09:03] God is the power of God as he spoke to
[1:09:08] him praise the Lord the bull
[1:09:12] recognized the power of God in the
[1:09:16] prophet praise the Lord and he took a
[1:09:19] step back and he sat down and the
[1:09:23] prophet went his way
[1:09:25] being
[1:09:26] reconciled to that we are being
[1:09:29] reconciled to that position which we
[1:09:32] lost in
[1:09:33] Adam praise the Lord where there shall
[1:09:37] be no fear in our
[1:09:39] lives where they shall be an
[1:09:43] assurance of who we are where there
[1:09:46] shall be an
[1:09:47] assurance of our position in
[1:09:50] Christ praise the Lord that's why he
[1:09:53] saying that because you were
[1:09:56] chosen because you are
[1:09:59] predestinated to be
[1:10:01] conformed and
[1:10:03] Sons praise the Lord to regain your
[1:10:07] position regain your control regain your
[1:10:11] Dominion when you ask
[1:10:14] anything in his name it shall be given
[1:10:17] unto you when the prophet spoke to theal
[1:10:21] in the name of Jesus
[1:10:22] Christ subject
[1:10:25] why he had taken over his
[1:10:28] control because the word of God was
[1:10:31] established in his life when the word of
[1:10:34] God get established in our lives it
[1:10:38] shall cast out every
[1:10:40] fear praise the Lord he shall establish
[1:10:44] Us Praise the Lord in the power of His
[1:10:49] might the prophet was still preaching
[1:10:52] and now here came the mad man
[1:10:55] who was
[1:10:56] possessed and then he came
[1:10:59] straight and he was coming to fight him
[1:11:03] he was determined to kill him and now
[1:11:05] there were some police
[1:11:07] officers who he had just prayed for and
[1:11:11] they had seen this man
[1:11:13] before this man had killed so many
[1:11:16] people and now they were rushing to get
[1:11:18] a
[1:11:20] hold a
[1:11:22] giant prise the Lord but because the
[1:11:24] prophet
[1:11:26] he had
[1:11:27] recognized the power of God in him he
[1:11:31] recognized that this
[1:11:33] what which we
[1:11:35] believe as power as
[1:11:39] dominion over every Power and
[1:11:42] principali he said the police
[1:11:45] officers leave him leave him to be and
[1:11:49] then the man came straight and he wanted
[1:11:51] to kill him praise the Lord and the
[1:11:54] prophet looked at him
[1:11:56] with love he looked at him with love
[1:12:00] because God is
[1:12:01] love praise the Lord and because God is
[1:12:05] love the love of God was shared in the
[1:12:07] life of
[1:12:09] Bram and he looked
[1:12:12] at the man was
[1:12:15] defending that the
[1:12:17] love there was power that came out of
[1:12:19] the love
[1:12:21] of and instantly the man found him
[1:12:25] himself on his on the
[1:12:27] ground and he fell and the people saw
[1:12:31] the hand of the Lord not because was so
[1:12:35] powerful because
[1:12:38] recognized the hand of the Lord power of
[1:12:42] God rested upon his word and as long as
[1:12:46] we have the word of
[1:12:48] God
[1:12:50] reconciled the word of God we have the
[1:12:53] same power
[1:12:55] because Jesus says Greater Works than
[1:12:59] these shall you do praise the Lord and
[1:13:03] he says you shall ask
[1:13:06] anything in his name and it shall be
[1:13:10] established praise the Lord if we have
[1:13:13] the word of
[1:13:16] godos in the word of God settles
[1:13:20] it praise the Lord and this message is
[1:13:24] establishing us is establishing the
[1:13:27] bright is bringing the
[1:13:30] bright into that
[1:13:33] image is bring the bright in the
[1:13:37] manifestation praise the Lord say that
[1:13:41] Christ once again is made manifest in
[1:13:45] this body of the praise the Living God I
[1:13:50] want to quote something here it is all
[1:13:53] by election
[1:13:55] it is all by
[1:13:57] predestination praise the lord we were
[1:14:00] in the Eternal thoughts of
[1:14:03] God that's
[1:14:05] why here and if we can
[1:14:09] know that we are here that we are the
[1:14:13] elect that we are the bright that we are
[1:14:16] the word of
[1:14:18] God being
[1:14:20] expressed being
[1:14:22] manifested in the end times
[1:14:25] then that will settle it because if we
[1:14:28] are the expressed Mind Of
[1:14:31] God we know the mind of God is eternal
[1:14:35] if the mind of God is
[1:14:37] eternal the
[1:14:39] expression of the mind of God that makes
[1:14:42] us Eternal so we can never fail praise
[1:14:46] the lord we shall have
[1:14:49] failures we have
[1:14:51] battles when
[1:14:54] recognize power of the word of
[1:14:57] God we shall
[1:15:00] sail over and
[1:15:03] above all the
[1:15:06] weaknesses All the Troubles all the
[1:15:09] fights in this
[1:15:10] body he says you a chosen people he has
[1:15:14] chosen us to live above and over all the
[1:15:18] people of the
[1:15:21] earth
[1:15:23] says praise Living God I want to quote
[1:15:27] something here The Message God has the
[1:15:30] provided
[1:15:31] way
[1:15:33] Abraham
[1:15:35] thech the
[1:15:41] patriarch come down out of
[1:15:44] sh away from the Tower of
[1:15:48] Babel father joury down into the pl
[1:15:52] [Music]
[1:15:55] down into the
[1:15:57] Plains and there
[1:15:59] Abraham at the age of about 75 years
[1:16:02] old God called him by election and sent
[1:16:06] him out of his
[1:16:08] country telling him that he was going to
[1:16:11] have a
[1:16:12] child his wife Sarah who was 65 years
[1:16:17] old the time I want you to see how God's
[1:16:22] promises are so real to those who will
[1:16:26] accept
[1:16:27] it and he told him what he was going to
[1:16:31] do and he moved
[1:16:33] out not knowing where he was going but
[1:16:37] so Jed in a Strange
[1:16:39] Land God when he calls people he calls
[1:16:44] for total
[1:16:46] separation all the things of the
[1:16:48] world from the worldly
[1:16:51] things separate yourself and God will
[1:16:54] bless
[1:16:55] come out from among them and be notak of
[1:17:00] their and
[1:17:02] Abraham had to take his wife and leave
[1:17:05] the country but he believed God by faith
[1:17:11] he couldn't reason it out there is no
[1:17:13] way of finding how he ever do
[1:17:16] it there's no he can find out how
[1:17:20] Abraham could ever believe
[1:17:22] it just to God by his word
[1:17:27] and now how could God ever bless
[1:17:31] Abraham son at that age you couldn't
[1:17:35] explain it how his wife lived with lived
[1:17:40] with her since he was a young
[1:17:43] girl both of them young healthy people
[1:17:48] all these
[1:17:49] days till she was then 45 or 60
[1:17:56] probably 25
[1:18:01] years and God said you going to have a
[1:18:05] baby by this
[1:18:07] woman Abraham believed
[1:18:10] God against all
[1:18:14] reason that's what we ow
[1:18:18] to all
[1:18:21] reason against all scientific research
[1:18:26] against all
[1:18:28] scientifical
[1:18:30] foundations we just have to believe God
[1:18:33] the Bible says there is going to be a
[1:18:36] bride who will fure in the
[1:18:39] Rapture and the bride will be taken
[1:18:42] away and yet science says we are simply
[1:18:47] pulled towards the center of the
[1:18:50] Earth because of
[1:18:52] gravity but because of faith
[1:18:55] we believe that the bride shall be taken
[1:18:58] away and shall work against the
[1:19:01] scientifical
[1:19:05] Foundation because God say
[1:19:08] so I believe it has to be
[1:19:12] established that's how Abraham
[1:19:15] believed God at his
[1:19:17] word take God at his
[1:19:20] word his word shall be established in
[1:19:22] our lives
[1:19:25] praise the Living God and another
[1:19:28] message the calling of
[1:19:30] Abraham he says friends if you have
[1:19:34] received the Holy Spirit you are Sons
[1:19:37] and Daughters of God you are the seed of
[1:19:40] abrah and Jo with
[1:19:44] him and
[1:19:47] God and the same
[1:19:50] face in
[1:19:52] Abraham is in every belie
[1:19:56] tonight hallelujah hallelujah God by his
[1:19:59] Amazing
[1:20:00] Grace called you out of the SL of the
[1:20:09] world and give you the Holy
[1:20:12] Ghost not because you deserved
[1:20:15] it he says I have chosen you not because
[1:20:21] you deserved it but he has chosen us
[1:20:25] because he loved us and he says he has
[1:20:28] chosen
[1:20:30] Us Praise the Lord not because we were
[1:20:35] good he wasn't
[1:20:40] good he has called you out not because
[1:20:45] you are good or because you deserved it
[1:20:49] because he called you to eat
[1:20:52] unconditionally
[1:20:56] not because you are
[1:20:58] good you weren't good but because not
[1:21:02] because your mother was
[1:21:03] saved that's all right but you you are
[1:21:07] another
[1:21:09] individual that's right God called you
[1:21:13] by
[1:21:15] election because he knew
[1:21:18] us before the foundation of the
[1:21:22] world praise the Living God
[1:21:26] church he
[1:21:28] says Church
[1:21:30] AG qu in John
[1:21:36] 67 and verse4
[1:21:39] says verse 37 says all that the father
[1:21:44] give
[1:21:45] me shall come to me and him that cometh
[1:21:50] to me I shall in no wayse cast out
[1:21:55] all that the father has given me so it
[1:21:58] is the father in The Eternal purpose of
[1:22:01] the
[1:22:02] father that would choose you and call
[1:22:06] you out and present you unto
[1:22:09] Christ believe Jesus Christ Christ says
[1:22:14] the father has chosen us before the
[1:22:16] foundation of the
[1:22:18] world has brought us to the
[1:22:20] word which is Jesus Christ there is nowh
[1:22:25] the word can reject
[1:22:28] us the Lord there is no way the world so
[1:22:33] the word will lose
[1:22:35] us if you have been called because you
[1:22:39] were known
[1:22:41] before called the
[1:22:44] word the word of
[1:22:47] God lose you so you have been called to
[1:22:51] be
[1:22:52] established against all
[1:22:57] all
[1:22:59] orders all
[1:23:02] powers any sin that ever existed in the
[1:23:06] world because Jesus
[1:23:09] said them that the father has called and
[1:23:13] given me I shall not lose now I shall
[1:23:17] not lose even a single
[1:23:19] one praise the Lord no man come to me
[1:23:24] except the father draw him and I raise
[1:23:27] him up at the last day and John 1 ver3
[1:23:33] says but as many has received
[1:23:38] him who are those that received him
[1:23:42] those that were
[1:23:43] chosen
[1:23:45] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:23:47] the
[1:23:48] world praise the Lord that they would
[1:23:50] receive him and as many as received him
[1:23:54] them gave he the
[1:23:56] power to become the sons of
[1:23:59] God those that were
[1:24:02] elected praise the Lord he gave us the
[1:24:05] power to be the sons of God you are
[1:24:09] predestinated a son of God you
[1:24:12] predestinated be of God the foundation
[1:24:16] of the world so we are here not by
[1:24:19] mistake we are here by
[1:24:22] election because he knew us
[1:24:25] because he loved us so he called us
[1:24:29] Jesus Christ and Christ is very
[1:24:33] careful not to lose anyone of
[1:24:37] us so that's the assurance that you
[1:24:40] have because he has chosen you and he
[1:24:43] has elected you so you're not going to
[1:24:45] be
[1:24:46] lost praise the Lord you won't be lost
[1:24:49] so you just have to submit
[1:24:51] yourself through the leadership of the
[1:24:53] Holy Spirit
[1:24:59] the by the F by the word you live by the
[1:25:04] word you speak by the
[1:25:07] word by the word you overcome the word
[1:25:10] by the
[1:25:12] word being established in the word of
[1:25:15] God praise the Lord which and he says to
[1:25:20] become the sons of
[1:25:21] God even to them that believe on his
[1:25:28] name were
[1:25:31] born now listen to this we know that we
[1:25:35] were
[1:25:36] born by the blood of our
[1:25:39] mothers we know the process of of being
[1:25:43] born water blood and life we know there
[1:25:48] is something that
[1:25:51] ruptures and then water flows
[1:25:55] to prepare a life that is
[1:25:57] coming another thing
[1:25:59] ruptures and blood comes out then baby
[1:26:03] is
[1:26:04] born says that we were
[1:26:08] born not of that
[1:26:11] blood we simply we simply pass through
[1:26:15] it but the of God not that we should be
[1:26:19] born by that
[1:26:21] blood praise the Lord and says nor of
[1:26:25] the will of the
[1:26:27] flesh nor of the will of
[1:26:30] man but of
[1:26:32] God are born of the will of God
[1:26:37] according to his own good
[1:26:39] pleasure Ephesians 1 verse says
[1:26:44] according as he has chosen Us in
[1:26:50] him before the found of the world
[1:26:54] we were chosen in him before the
[1:26:58] foundation of the world so when we are
[1:27:00] born into this
[1:27:01] world praise the Lord and we have tested
[1:27:04] of
[1:27:05] sin T of
[1:27:08] iniquity that was not purose of
[1:27:11] God because in him we were born
[1:27:15] holy without any
[1:27:18] blame God he has known
[1:27:21] Us in in him before the foundation of
[1:27:25] the world and he has chosen Us in him
[1:27:29] before the foundation of the world that
[1:27:31] we should be
[1:27:33] holy and Without
[1:27:36] Blame having predestinated
[1:27:39] us and through the adoption of
[1:27:42] children by Christ
[1:27:44] Jesus to
[1:27:46] himself praise the Lord now without
[1:27:51] getting follow the prophet says without
[1:27:54] getting involved into the subject of
[1:27:58] sovereignity into the subject of
[1:28:00] sovereignity of
[1:28:04] God he says for that would take a book
[1:28:08] in
[1:28:10] itself let me point
[1:28:12] out where here that according to these
[1:28:17] verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own
[1:28:22] price just the same as men would their
[1:28:26] Brides
[1:28:29] today Jesus Christ is choosing
[1:28:33] his the same way a man would choose
[1:28:39] his what is the
[1:28:41] principle when the man is choosing the
[1:28:44] bride the man who chooses the
[1:28:47] girl to take to be a
[1:28:50] wife it is not the girl that chooses the
[1:28:55] praise the Lord even if she loved him
[1:28:59] but if he has not chosen her she can't
[1:29:02] be a
[1:29:03] wife praise the Lord so now the
[1:29:06] choice is for the
[1:29:09] bridegroom choice is not for the
[1:29:13] bright let's catch this mystery that God
[1:29:17] God is
[1:29:18] choosing is not
[1:29:21] because we loved him so much
[1:29:25] no sir it's because he loved us and he
[1:29:30] chose us praise the Lord God is choosing
[1:29:34] it's not because we are so
[1:29:38] good sir it's because he simply loved
[1:29:43] us says the bride
[1:29:46] today does not simply
[1:29:49] decide she is going to take a certain
[1:29:51] man for a husband
[1:29:54] no sir it is the groom who choose who
[1:29:58] decides chooses a certain woman for
[1:30:02] his and John 15 ver
[1:30:07] says you have not chosen
[1:30:10] me but I have chosen you you did not
[1:30:14] choose
[1:30:15] me but I Choose You the
[1:30:20] bridegroom shows
[1:30:22] himself the bride
[1:30:25] he chose us by
[1:30:26] himself praise the Lord our
[1:30:29] position is by
[1:30:31] election our position is because he
[1:30:34] loved us and he chose us praise the Lord
[1:30:39] not according to the word of God the
[1:30:42] bride was chosen for the foundation of
[1:30:43] the
[1:30:46] world now according to the word of
[1:30:49] God the bride was chosen before the
[1:30:52] foundation of the world
[1:30:55] you believe that that's what the
[1:30:57] scripture says we were chosen before the
[1:31:01] foundation of the world this choosing of
[1:31:04] the
[1:31:05] Bride wased in
[1:31:09] himself and he quotes Romans
[1:31:14] 91 that the purpose of
[1:31:16] God according to
[1:31:20] election
[1:31:22] stand the purose of God go choosing the
[1:31:26] bright according to
[1:31:29] election that she was in
[1:31:33] him before the foundation of the
[1:31:36] world
[1:31:38] stand you can't read it
[1:31:42] any
[1:31:46] purpose the Eternal purpose of God was
[1:31:49] to take a
[1:31:51] bride of his own choosing
[1:31:54] and that purpose was in was in himself
[1:31:58] and being
[1:32:00] Eternal was decreed before the
[1:32:02] foundation of the world that's why says
[1:32:05] Jacob have i
[1:32:07] l Jacob did not have a choice to be
[1:32:12] loved it was the choice of
[1:32:15] God he love Jacob and Es did not do any
[1:32:21] wrong for God to hate him
[1:32:24] it was the purpose of God he loved Jacob
[1:32:27] and
[1:32:28] rejected theose of God he loved you and
[1:32:33] rejected the
[1:32:34] world our choice the choosing of the
[1:32:37] Bride is in the etal purpose of
[1:32:41] God and in the message the door inside
[1:32:45] the
[1:32:46] door
[1:32:48] 1960 I quote paragraph 59 or if you
[1:32:52] would just look behind IND our
[1:32:55] shoulder and see how good God is been to

[1:33:04] Sinner to see that he's brought yourself

[1:37:57] millenni no man can come to me except my
[1:38:01] father has

[1:38:14] Eternity the Holy Ghost is
[1:38:17] eternal then you are in
[1:38:19] eternity you are in eternity says if you

[1:38:26] of Christ if you have the word of God in
[1:38:29] your
[1:38:30] life which we believe we
[1:38:33] have because how did we believe his word
[1:38:38] without the Holy Spirit praise the Lord
[1:38:41] it has to be the holy spirit to guide us
[1:38:44] to the
[1:38:45] words it has to be the holy spirit to
[1:38:48] guide us to
[1:38:50] believe the Holy Ghost to give us the
[1:38:53] faith
[1:38:54] believe his
[1:38:56] word how did Abraham
[1:38:58] believe it had be God himself comp
[1:39:03] Abraham to have faith believe God how
[1:39:07] you believe it has to be
[1:39:10] God it has to be God who compell you to
[1:39:15] believe his words no man can come to me
[1:39:20] except the father has drawn him to
[1:39:23] praise the Lord so the prophet says if
[1:39:26] you have the Holy Ghost then you are
[1:39:29] Eternal and you shall be
[1:39:31] etern praise the Lord and I want say

[1:39:56] Holy Spirit that means we are
[1:39:59] Eternal because the Holy
[1:40:02] Ghost is
[1:40:04] eternal and him being in

[1:40:24] him that means he has to give us the
[1:40:26] Holy Spirit and if he gives us the holy
[1:40:29] spirit that means we have to be
[1:40:32] there
[1:40:34] expression of eternal life expression of
[1:40:39] the Life of Christ in this body praise
[1:40:43] the Lord he says you are in
[1:40:46] eternity where you
[1:40:48] was all the time because you we
[1:40:53] we are in the mind of
[1:40:55] God as
[1:40:57] Eternal we expressed in the mind of God
[1:41:00] as
[1:41:02] Eternal we in his
[1:41:04] mind why because God and his
[1:41:08] mind one can separate you and your
[1:41:12] mind you and your mind are one
[1:41:15] person the mind of God is
[1:41:18] eternal and we are the expression of the
[1:41:20] mind of
[1:41:21] God we are
[1:41:24] Eternal you can never fail praise the
[1:41:27] Lord is a gift God elected Us by
[1:41:32] election he chose us to be who we are
[1:41:37] today praise the Lord are you happy to
[1:41:40] be here today are you happy to be a part
[1:41:43] of the
[1:41:44] words praise the Lord do you believe
[1:41:47] that you are the chosen
[1:41:49] one that you are
[1:41:51] known the foundation of the world
[1:41:54] praise the Lord and he says see you are
[1:41:59] made for an eternal
[1:42:01] purpose because you was the
[1:42:05] manifestation of the
[1:42:07] attribute that was in
[1:42:10] God that
[1:42:12] thought that thought of you and
[1:42:16] expressed you it thought of you and says
[1:42:20] let us create man
[1:42:23] praise the Lord And now when that
[1:42:26] thought was
[1:42:29] expressed Man became the expression of
[1:42:32] the
[1:42:33] thought and man came into
[1:42:37] existence so Man became the
[1:42:40] manifestation of the
[1:42:42] attribute that was in
[1:42:47] God
[1:42:49] Eternal that makes you eternal
[1:42:53] seed of God is but
[1:42:56] Eternal the seed of God is eternal
[1:43:00] praise the Lord and says and expressed
[1:43:05] you and made an earth to take you
[1:43:09] out and to make you a human
[1:43:12] being and then sin come along and
[1:43:16] perverted his
[1:43:18] way
[1:43:20] come but you was lost praise the Lord
[1:43:24] because in the expression of God in the
[1:43:26] mind of God we would be
[1:43:29] born by the word the way Jesus Christ
[1:43:32] was
[1:43:33] born it was the word that came unto Mary
[1:43:38] and says you shall bear a
[1:43:40] son and that word was expressed in the
[1:43:44] wom of
[1:43:45] Mary when she produced the body of Jesus
[1:43:48] it was the
[1:43:50] expression of the word came from God
[1:43:54] through the angel the womb of Mary the
[1:43:58] prophet says here that we would be
[1:44:02] expressed we would
[1:44:05] manifest we be
[1:44:08] manifested the same
[1:44:10] manner
[1:44:12] somehow sin come along and perverted his
[1:44:16] way then you come
[1:44:20] anyhow but you was lost
[1:44:23] with the world so he come and redeemed
[1:44:27] you the expressed
[1:44:31] attribute redeem you the expressed
[1:44:35] attribute and also redeems you and
[1:44:38] redeems this Earth by the same way then

[1:44:44] purpose rolls on oh see hallelujah
[1:44:49] hallelujah oh that that does me so good
[1:44:54] of just that lays
[1:44:56] ahead now in Ephesians
[1:44:58] 110 says now if you are putting it
[1:45:02] down it's called not a
[1:45:06] dispensation it is
[1:45:08] called
[1:45:13] not not
[1:45:15] day
[1:45:19] is the fullness of time
[1:45:24] and when the fullness of
[1:45:26] time has come that's when time has been
[1:45:31] fulf when there is no more
[1:45:34] time then you go into
[1:45:37] eternity after the S AG is
[1:45:40] over and it is praise the Lord is
[1:45:45] over is over pcal age is over now you go
[1:45:51] into what
[1:45:54] eternity no more sevens no more threes
[1:45:58] no more
[1:45:59] other you are in
[1:46:02] eternity where there is no such time as
[1:46:06] numbers and times and things oh my you
[1:46:10] see it now all after time has been
[1:46:14] fulfilled all sin is gone taken away at
[1:46:18] the
[1:46:19] Millennium at the at the great white
[1:46:22] Throne judgment

[1:48:43] him the
[1:48:45] beginning now he comes back to us to
[1:48:48] live in US reconcile us back to take us
[1:48:53] back to live in Heavenly
[1:48:55] places in Christ Jesus God in the
[1:48:59] beginning when he thought of you and
[1:49:02] thought of others like that and thought
[1:49:05] of others like
[1:49:07] that thought of
[1:49:09] himself of being
[1:49:12] tangible that was his
[1:49:14] thought see so he expressed his thoughts
[1:49:18] by
[1:49:20] what he wanted to be tangible
[1:49:23] God being expressed in
[1:49:28] us because
[1:49:30] before he was the the Eternal
[1:49:33] God praise the Lord
[1:49:36] inang but now he expressed his thoughts
[1:49:40] by
[1:49:41] what and said let there be let there be
[1:49:46] and there was and there was and the word
[1:49:50] expressed in form of a body
[1:49:53] to make
[1:49:54] Adam praise the Lord and to make ad and
[1:49:58] on and on now here we

[1:50:56] himself in the bright the fullness of
[1:51:00] time has come praise the Lord in
[1:51:04] paragraph 246 of the same
[1:51:07] message as we finish the fullness of
[1:51:11] time has come after
[1:51:14] time has been
[1:51:18] fulfilled is gone after the world is
[1:51:22] baptism
[1:51:23] after the world baptism makes it f
[1:51:26] Place
[1:51:29] sicks then his attributes is
[1:51:33] expressed because it was there first to
[1:51:36] begin with that's what he s praise the
[1:51:41] Lord and then what happened he set Adam
[1:51:44] and Eve on the
[1:51:46] earth

[1:51:51] their bodies was all laid out
[1:51:54] there for you to eat and make your
[1:51:57] body that's the way he had of doing
[1:52:01] it but sin come
[1:52:05] along and interrupted his
[1:52:08] plan but what did Jesus
[1:52:11] do came down and expressed himself in
[1:52:14] the form of a
[1:52:16] man a human being gave his life remember
[1:52:21] this was the etal purpose of
[1:52:24] God he laid the
[1:52:27] foundation that he laid the
[1:52:30] lamb and he slew the lamb before the
[1:52:34] foundation of the world this is what the
[1:52:37] prophet is saying Jesus came down and
[1:52:41] expressed himself in the form of a
[1:52:43] man being a human he gave his life for
[1:52:48] what reconcile us back and reestablish
[1:52:52] us to the position that we lost in Adam
