right God bless you this afternoon nice to meet you again Joy To Worship the Lord what a privilege to be awakened and to be redeemed to be brought back by the spoken word hallelujah hallelujah please sit down for a while I believe that you are uh you had a little rest I trust that your food was not too big because otherwise you will fight with a sleep but there is a second portion after this meeting you will be be released go to the place from you came from and uh to bring some good things to the others once again thank you pastoral for inviting us he was several times in our congregation in Poland it was always a blessing for us amen amen and I trust thatth soon he will come back but I know there is a tremendous work to do in Uganda as well and our hearts are with you we want to pray for you and go with you we are the same part of the same battle but we are also uh together very privileged people and uh I want to greet all the ministers from my heart I was happy to see all of you and hear your names may the Lord bless you abundantly above the meure as you are laboring for your uh uh families and for your churches God bless you I would say just go in thy power Mighty Man of Valor amen you remember Gideon he he had such a low state of value he esteemed himself so low but God had his own thoughts about him Mighty Man of and he was hiding himself somewhere in the cave God can see us at different way that we can see ourselves and he knows how to encourage us because the comforter didn't yet leave the church the comforter holy spirit will be with us to the end of the world so go with your power every one of you have your own personal power but it's connected with your position it's connected with your new name I'm going to speak this afternoon about the power of the new name there is a mystery of the new name and doesn't lay in heaven it shouldn't only lay in the Bible but inside of you there is a mystery of your new name when we will discover our new name is changing our walk it's changing our talk it's changing the way we perceive ourselves it influence how we perceive the others is a high calling it's a different walk everything is changing when you hear directly from God your new name we supposed to live under the power of the new name I will give you testimony uh many years ago we started to print the books of brother Bram in English language and we did it uh we sent the parcels to many countries the world wherever the people they want to get that 200 300 books uh booklets in the Box we send them but when the pandemic came like Corona they sto we couldn't send anymore so we have been very discouraged but you know the Lord made a way for us that uh uh we started to send the books not for the 200 300 but the 10,000 books on one pallette to many countries of Africa is only shows when the enemy is coming as a flat he wants to frighten you but if you not if you are not afraid of Satan but you believe God God will show you a highest standard if the waves of enemy is coming to cover to kill the people definitely the these waves will sunk some people but there will be a group of people that God will turn everything for good and by these waves he will lift you up higher you walk on these waves you will walk on the sea like Peter just stay on the post of Duty never allow the spirit of fear come upon you so God allowed us to to print 100 th000 books hundred and hundreds and you know this message is powerful because it uncovers the Satan's Edom uncovers Satan's Eden uncovers is showing the the schemes of the enemy that his throne is in the heart of the people today but he cannot deceive the bride because we are not part of Satan's Eden we are part of the different Eden restoration of the Eden is the r of the sun this is a new day the old things passed away and in the morning He restored the mercies because it's the rise of the sun we are the only species because we are eagles the sound doesn't blind us we can fly against the [Music] sun we can fly higher higher because we have a double eyelash so we cannot be blind like the eagles and this message removes the spirit of Amnesia because we've been part of God from the beginning we we are not saved here in this time you've been always saved you didn't become Christian you are always you've been Christian your name was placed the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world you are the very attribute of God manifest in flesh but the first birth gave us Amnesia but the second birth the new birth takes away Amnesia from us so listen those things Amnesia Spirit Amnesia you see because Amnesia is like a FK over you we have been covered by the FK so we we couldn't see where we are but this Amnesia is coming by stroke when the person sick he's losing a conscience who he is but by the washing of the word by the word of Separation God removes Tes away from us Amnesia and let you know who you are there the reason you have to recognize your day and his message it's not only the message of the hour but it's also your day some people they say yes I believe the message I believe the Bible I believe the promise for that age you have to recognize also your day God's calling your position your name will talk this afternoon about it beyond the curtain of time someone was taken up someone was taken up beyond the curtain of time it was like a Joshua he brought the report of the new land like Jesus he died he went up he came back as the Holy Ghost and gave us report of the new land Mal for Prophet was taken beyond the curtain of time when he came back he said I saw you there are you one of them one of them one of them I'm so glad that I say one of them one of them one of them one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say one of them one of the masterpiece God is a sculpture he took your portion and removed from you everything that was not his vision that's how you are becoming a masterpiece there's a masterpiece of alpha there's a masterpiece of Omega coming from Christ the same piece of rock you are the master piece there's a time to count down we are living a zero hour rocket come down 10 n 765 4 3 2 1 zero it means fire when the Elijah is on the Earth when the Elijah is on the earth this is a zero hour for the church be ready any time we will not go down we will not go to prison we'll go up by the power of spirit of Revelation amen hallelujah hallelujah because of the marriage inv oh there is no Union in the church people are blind there is a union in the church but this Union is invisible you must be a spiritual person to see there is a union of Christ and his bride and he will take up his body you will not go to tribulation period because you are Justified you have never done it in the first place they are Justified free your sinless bride your are Virgin of his word that's the reason we have approving of his word he came down son of man revealing flesh to marry you amen no the clergy not the clergy not any church son of man came down in flesh to make the bride and bridegroom one that's the reason you are the proof of his word hallelujah hallelujah we have some of the message with us we can give to the pastors after the meeting amen amen God bless you Saints glory to God for this message Hallelujah you are the message of the hour you are the open book take like Esther be identified with the word of the king and pro prophesy again take the book e it up and go your way this is a God in flesh again God promised that he will not take a church from he will not take a church before the tribulation period unfortunately the church will go through the purification period but before the tribulation Period start he will take up his word he will take up his bride because the bride she step out of the church this is a spirit element of this Exodus amen I ask you to stand up let's open a St Matthew 16 St Matthew 16 amen St Matthew 16 from the verse 13 when Jesus came into the course of cesaria philippy be asked he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say you that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah for the Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou are Peter and Upon This Rock I will build up my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shal bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shal lose on Earth shall be loose in heaven amen so there are three things in that portion of the scripture Peter he recognized a true revelation he just pick it up directly from the father not from the preacher not even from Jesus but the anointing Came Upon him he had access to the Father and Jesus said you are blessed because The Father revealed to you he had access to the spirit father is the spirit and then his name was change he was not Simon and more he was a Peter amen he was not Petra he was P I will build my church upon [Music] Petra Rock but your name is Petros a little rock that is part of the big rock but I will beat my church not upon Peter not upon Paul not upon Luther not upon William Bram not upon me or you upon the rock of Revelation devil will not be able to shake it because of strong Foundation right kind of Revelation change of the name and the authority back Peter I give you key of the Kingdom three things that should happen in your life when you come to the knowledge of the truth you are getting personal revelation change your name and you are getting Authority Dominion in the church back but you have to recognize your name it will never happen without the Revelation now let's read from the book of Revelation 2 Book of Revelation chapter 2 verse 17 do you love him can you say Jesus he's here you remember brother Bram in the middle of the night where in the middle of the darkness Darkness everywhere but brother was praying and he saw him when he came to him and he was trying to he was trying to make a little noise Jesus didn't react but when he says Jesus he look at him amen it has got a meaning when you say Jesus don't watch other churches they can sing and and loudly hollering and everything Jesus amen amen everyone can say my name they can curse me hate me but when my wife she says y I'm turning around amen Jesus he that had ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches to him that overcome it will I give to it of hid Mana so now the word of the Lord is directed to the Overcomers and will give him a white stone and in the stone how is in your Bible because some Bible is upon the stone but in the King James is in the stone okay and in the stone White Stone a new name written which no man knowth saving he that receives it I don't know your name your real name neighbor doesn't know the name of the neighbor is a secret it's inside of the rock hidden and no one's know that only you if Overcomer God bless you let's pray precious Heavenly Father once again we are approaching to you with a deep confidence in our hearts that the way beyond our mistakes you are going to meet with us not because of us but because of your eternal love thank you for restoration of Fellowship is the power by blood is a power in Fellowship in the power in joy we are redeemed back oh God by your perfect sacrifice thank you Jesus we glorify th holy name and we ask you once again come right to our hearts share with us the mystery that the worldly Church knows nothing about it politicians they know nothing about Kings of this Earth they know nothing about but you are Whispering the truth the mystery to the ear of the Bride take us once again on your knees Lord and refresh the word refresh the relationship let us leave this building tonight completely [Applause] transformed that's our desire and thirst to meet with you on the base of the word of God in the place you have chosen in the name name of Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you Saints please take your seats so we speak about the power of the new name the new name inside of The White Rock Rock in the Bible represents Revelation but also Rog in the Bible uh represents a statement confession and we know that today there's so many confessions religious confession I believe this I believe that and they don't Fellowship to each other because they are confessions are different but God promise will be a confession one Lord one faith and one baptism only one confession one Revelation one rock in Isaiah God said to Isaiah Prophet look inside of the rock that you are coming from did you see how I called Abraham and Sarah only these two I called them only two look at the Rock from you chop off amen God is the rock he's the rock of Revelation and all of us we supposed to be part of the same Rock Amen you know how there is a big rock in the mountains and there is the Mountain Brook it's very fast that the water is going down but you know through years the the the rocks are just uh disassembled from the big rock it crumbles it's coming to the to the brook of the water and the strong current of the water is pushing the Rocks down down down down it's coming from the high lower lower lower you think why it happens because when these small rocks they are coming from the big rock they are Sharp able to cut easily to hurt you but in the Stream of the water being assembled together it's like a heating each to other but after some years of process they are transformed they are coming to the Sea they coming the ocean and they nice Pebbles round around nothing can hurt you cannot hurt each other but the stone that is run around we are in the process friends amen transformation by the washing of the water of the world but we are part of the same great Rock and we are on the way back because we will spend the whole eternity together if the Rog represents Revelation if the Rog represents a revelation and the statement confession like a Peter has done in the Matthew 16 I will give you one example in the Old Testament they didn't have a perfect word of God the word of God was not yet completed it was not the perfect Revelation so God was using uim and tamim and we know those a birth plate of the high priest you know any time the someone had the Revelation like a vision or dream they brought the person to the Tabernacle and he was standing before the priest and he was telling his revelation you know what the Paul he said even in the angel will come from heaven and say something different from that word from the previous original Revelation follow it even me myself Paul he said even the bright angel from heaven don't follow it it must be scriptural so when the person was telling his Revelation and there was a birth plate of the high priest if he spoke the truth there was a shaking of Glory coming down from heaven and he was reflecting himself in the stones if this is what the truth there was a rainbow Supernatural colors twinking around if not if it was not the truth was no Supernatural no glory in the temple I want to tell you something these 12 Stones represented 12 names so the name is attached to a stone this 12 Stones 12 names represented 12 tribes of Israel so these names the stones represented the whole church but the stones that coming from the earth we are born from the earth amen but the sh was coming from heaven and if there was a Voice of Truth was completely identified with that Stones the supernatural light hit every stone Benjamin Benjamin reuben reuben Joseph God was identified with every stone with every name that was attached to a stone I tell you Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm asking you friends where are those stones where are those stones from the earth that the name is attached to every stone that can reflect the glory of God according to their standard they tribe Jesus the Same God wanted to show something how by the name he can contact or just put together the Heaven and the Earth your name is very important your your name is more important than you think you're very blessed in Africa some of the countries you know that you ask the person what's your name oh my name is hallelujah my name is Glory my name is sh very nice positive names give to your child a positive name amen amen give them positive name because it will influence the child amen amen amen we have people in the church by their names you can identify exactly what they are doing and what they will do in future okay we have a brother in the church his name is bronic bronic and bronic means is a a very wellknown person that defends he's a Defender famous defender I told him once Bron stay with the truth and defend the truth you have a wonderful name but never defend something wrong because if you have if you are Defender famous defender you you've got the a character Insight or or the temperament that you will defend everything don't stay on the way of this man if he'll do something wrong he can break your your bones because his name is Defender but if you are born again your name go impact on you you will be defender of the truth you will be S stand like a rock hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I have a question is there anyone here in this wonderful congregation that is not happy of his Earthly name and you are eager to know your new name is there anyone here not happy with the natural Earthly name that you thought many times if my parents would give me a better name can I see your hands it seems this is very happy congregation oh you you you wish to have a different name am I right he had the name which he did not want was called uhhuh it means that suffering is not for one so he was to suffer so he requested to change his name and was given oh so you have already new name yeah yeah God bless you okay it's also a very good idea when I was in India I asked what's your name brother my name is Paul what's your name my name is John what's your name my name is William what's your name sister my name is mid oh my goodness you have such a good names and you are from India and they said all of us we had the bad names all of us we had the names of our Gods but when I I believe the message I believe Jesus Christ and I was baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ Pastor gave me a new name yeah Peter Paul amen yeah Mary amen you John that's how it works we need to have a good name I'm going to speak to you that even our Earthly name is not the main one because the Bible says when you are getting the name from God no one will know it only receiver and this is not for the natural birth because this is promise for Overcomers you will have to overcome Satan's even the evil age you will have to overcome yourself you you will have to overcome the lineage of your old family your temperament your temperament your habits this is the promise for Overcomers if you will overcome I will give you a white stone we know the white is the only original color that's the reason Revelation 19 Revelation 19 Jesus will ride on the White Horse but you too because his Army we go his army are believers he Jesus he's got name new name word of God the Bible says it's written on his vure his new name Revelation 19 his Earthly name was Jesus Savior but he saved he redeemed the names but now when he came to Glory he got a new name his name is word of God that's the reason we see the mess in the churches because they are worshiping historical Jesus oh yes I know Jesus yes Jesus Loves Me I I I know that he he has chosen me and on and on he died for me 2,000 years ago amen but Jesus is Alive what about today you need a word for today his new name is the word of God because at the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the same word became flesh in Jesus but Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it must be also the word of God in flesh of his church so Jesus will ride on his horse on his white power pure power but your horse and uh your garment is also white so it proves that your power is not intermingle with any other power there is a power behind the gospel there's a power behind the word and it's pure it's original it's clean hallelujah hallelujah oh wonderful we can still ride on our horse amen amen there was a brother he was a pastor in Jeffersonville or around his name was Junior Jackson and uh in a certain dream uh he saw there was a a horse big horse from Heaven provided for him and he was a pastor he believed in M brother Bram but he was he had his own ideas little mixed with the word but God gave him a chance he sent him a horse which is the power from heaven and it was a beautiful horse and he should just sat on the horse and go but there was his wife start to talk to him so he looked back and start to communicate with his wife and we know the woman is a church so the pastor he came under influence of his church when God has provided for him a superpower a horse from Heaven that fit to him but he just looked back start to talk his wife when he again look horse was not there the power disappeared that's the reason we have to be careful stay with your power stay with your name stay with your position don't listen everyone don't come under any other influence only the word because the name of Jesus today is the word of God you are the living Apostles you are the Living Word of God the living voice living manifestation of that Bible that will not go to Rapture it will not go to Rapture but you will go to Rapture this is the word of God but this is not enough to go to Rapture that is a quickening power to make a living word of God for your hallelujah hallelujah so now we are diving a little more into the new name do you know that uh when brother Bram was born was given to him a new name maybe you don't know it but I spoke with some eyewitnesses eyewitnesses people from his area and when uh his father Charles Bram Charles Bram uh before William was born Charles Bram Charles Bram six letters he changed his name to Charles Bram seven letters before he was before he was at Charles Bram six letters but he he went to the local authorities and he changed his name adding H so he became a Charles AB Bram seven letters we know that Bible runs with numbers the Bible runs with numbers we know the first Man was created in a seven day six day and seven day got rest amen eight is eternity four is number of Deliverance three is Unity seven Perfection 12 24 is a worship amen 17 Redemption 40 Temptation and deliverance 50 is a jubilee and the seventh is a fullness so the whole Bible rounds with numbers but the six is a number of the men because the man was creating the sixth day so it is not anymore Bram but [Laughter] Bram God allowed before was born we know that he was born with a commission he was born with a pit of fire but he was Bram seven letters but we know that Graham Billy Graham six letters he was a messenger to the world preach the gospel to Sodom calling them out Bram seven letters there was a h and a h like Abraham is a God's breath God breathes when he speaks when he's changing your name he breathes on you there is a power behind so brother Bram was born as William Bram seven letters if you would ask him being one week old or maybe month old maybe two years old what's your name two years what's your name he didn't know but he was already William which means will I am am William means will I am so he had the beautiful name William Mar Bram William Mar Bram three * seven God wanted to show you something but when he was one year old if someone ask him what's your name he didn't know he didn't know who he was but he was William Mario Bram God made him this when the child is born he's receiving a name directly as the little small kid or baby he doesn't know but officially he's got a name since you are born again getting name not from the parents from God but you don't know it maybe you are talking with the unknown tongues when I was saved I was talking unknown tongues all the time because I found what the Paul said I'm speaking with the unknown tongues more than the others so I was talking talking and talking but I didn't know my new name I was talking to God but then I realize there's also another channels of communication if you don't if you talk to God all the time with the unknown tongues you don't understand conversation you don't understand conversation it's mysterious It's Supernatural but you don't understand but the whole Paul he said you can pray according to mind and you can pray also on other level without mind so when you pray with the unknown tongues you are praying out of mind this is different Channel but you don't understand but the inner man is growing this is good but God also provided for you the way of communication you will understand a conversation with god can you imagine if I would just go we like with my wife to walk we we walk every day five seven kilometers just to walk just to uh give a favor to our bodies because this is a temple of the holy spirit so so we go and walk and talk can you imagine that uh uh uh I would speak to my wife for one hour amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's how the people sometimes they talk to God in the churches Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory no one understands that the person doesn't understand God doesn't understand congregation doesn't understand people are coming to church and they think they are crazy there there re a Paul he said pray with understanding when you want to pray with unknown tongues pray secretly when you come to a congregation like this praise with understanding amen say Amen upon the word with understanding pray to God with understanding and he will just speak to you back that's the reason we have to grow that's what we call adoption you cannot stay like a baby angel of the Lord he w brother Bram don't stay always with the Pentecostal babies there's a saying if if if you are on certain position and you will come on this position Jesus he said do it for a while if you see a brother he needs a help he ask you go with me one mile go with him even two but when you cover two miles tell to the brother I'm sorry I love you brother I I wanted to show you compassion and understanding so I walk with you more than you expected but this is good direction I go this direction you can go with me or you can go your way
