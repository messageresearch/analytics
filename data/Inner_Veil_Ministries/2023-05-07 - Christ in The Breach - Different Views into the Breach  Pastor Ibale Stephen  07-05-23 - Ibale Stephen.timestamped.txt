[36:46] praise the Lord
[36:53] let's stand up God wait a minute
[36:56] and according to the scripture already
[37:00] Book of Revelations
[37:06] and verse 1 and 2.
[37:11] before we read let us prayer sovereign
[37:35] we want that you may take your word but
[37:39] but
[37:40] you and speak to he that has an ear for
[37:44] you
[37:46] and I believe Lord
[37:52] we have heard your voice
[37:55] you've given us the grace to have an ear
[38:00] once you speak into the ear this morning
[38:05] you may plant seeds of life
[38:10] that will help us
[38:12] to go through this turmoil last times
[38:17] we commute our hearts into your hands
[38:21] as they receive from you
[38:25] in Jesus name
[38:27] amen amen
[38:29] so Revelation chapter four
[38:34] and then after that we shall go to
[38:36] Matthew chapter 13.
[38:40] he says after this I looked and behold
[38:43] a door was opened in heaven
[38:52] a door was opened
[38:56] in heaven origin
[38:59] John doesn't sign was in heaven
[39:03] but he says I looked
[39:06] and the door was opened in heaven
[39:10] I think you understand that
[39:13] he just got into Dimensions
[39:17] he was in the spirit
[39:21] and he was given a special Grace
[39:26] to see things Beyond Time
[39:31] amen Amina and the first voice which I
[39:35] heard
[39:37] is talking about the voices of the
[39:40] trumpet
[39:42] which was in Revelation chapter one
[39:47] he says and the first voice which I
[39:52] heard
[39:56] of a trumpet talking with me
[40:00] which said
[40:05] and that will show the things which must
[40:09] be Hereafter
[40:10] everyone
[40:12] immediately I was in the spirit
[40:16] and behold the throne was set in heaven
[40:20] [Music]
[40:22] and one sat on this room
[40:25] may the Lord that blessing the reading
[40:28] of Israel
[40:31] Yama
[40:33] so for a title today
[40:39] the different views into the bridge Indo
[40:47] of course the continuing Services Christ
[40:49] in the bridge
[40:53] amen Amina now when you have something
[40:57] precious
[41:00] something which is so
[41:03] valued
[41:06] you put it on the sale
[41:11] wherever you put it in a Cupboard and
[41:13] lock it watch it
[41:16] or you put it in a
[41:19] house and you lock
[41:22] Ed
[41:23] because it is valued
[41:26] you keep it under a seal which is
[41:31] the most
[41:35] you know greatest book of the book I
[41:39] mean of the Bible is
[41:43] the Book of Revelation
[41:46] because it's the winding up of all the
[41:50] work
[41:52] and we want to know how we are ending up
[41:57] from Genesis
[42:02] and so there is a lot of special things
[42:17] foreign
[42:30] so that's why Giovanni you should always
[42:34] pray or he knocks everything
[42:37] depend on him so that the seals in
[42:42] Revelation could release the revelation
[42:46] of what God is doing in their time
[42:51] amen amen do you love him so I want to
[42:56] go with you
[42:57] into the Book of Matthew chapter 13.
[43:01] and this is the principle as Jesus you
[43:05] know lays it down there yes
[43:16] and the disciples came and said that to
[43:19] him why speak as thou unto them in The
[43:22] Parables
[43:26] he was speaking Parable after party
[43:30] or
[44:44] foreign they would start speaking any
[44:47] problem
[44:48] that means he was not speaking to those
[44:52] people
[44:57] hallelujah and I want to see he that is
[45:03] the one whom the Lord
[45:06] he says
[45:08] they give this scriptures
[45:36] Whoever has to him shall be giveness
[45:58] [Applause]
[46:01] [Music]
[46:44] foreign will always wait for God to
[46:48] break the Revelation before him
[46:51] that's why we are here that while the
[46:54] pastor speak
[46:56] amen you just spread the wholeness
[47:00] to break for Revelation
[47:03] because that's what saves you
[47:06] amen and in them is fulfilled with the
[47:10] prophets of Isaiah which he says
[47:16] [Music]
[47:18] and shall not understand
[47:22] you shall see
[47:24] and shall not proceed
[47:27] for the people's heart is waxed gross
[47:37] and their eyes
[47:44] foreign
[48:07] so he says I won't spend all my time
[48:12] when God gives me food cartoon
[48:15] his desire is not to feed the Godsey
[48:22] is to feed the ship
[48:26] has got an ear of the spirit
[48:31] amen Amina they come pray that right and
[48:35] they hear from God
[48:36] they are not having their ear to the
[48:39] mouth
[48:40] they put their ear to God
[48:44] so as we come to service this morning
[48:52] amen praise the Lord he says a lot more
[48:56] here
[48:57] in verse 31.
[49:00] amen I'm laying a foundation here
[49:04] oh praise the Lord
[49:10] praise God
[49:13] foreign
[49:27] after I spoke of The Parables
[49:31] is speaking to them
[49:36] all these things expect Jesus enter the
[49:41] multitudes in Parables
[49:46] and without a parable spoke he not unto
[49:51] them
[49:54] that it might be fulfilled
[49:57] which was spoken by azer the prophet
[50:00] saying
[50:02] will open my mouth
[50:08] [Music]
[50:12] from the foundation of the world
[50:15] are you together with me so when you
[50:18] come down to church
[50:19] be sure that God is going to say
[50:22] something
[50:24] but when he's coming to the very
[50:27] valuable foreign
[50:42] amen Amina just give me the linear I
[50:46] mean uh
[50:49] what what do you call that
[50:51] praise the Lord so that we can look at
[50:54] these seven churches
[50:56] to get these seven men here again
[51:00] amen so that we can go into something
[51:04] that we understand thoroughly well amen
[51:12] so that we can be able to understand
[51:16] just stand out there and make the seven
[51:20] churches amen
[51:25] and then you make sure that you are
[51:27] touching a shooter
[51:29] no you stretch out you are touching it
[51:33] because a church age
[51:40] you understand what I mean
[51:42] so we get
[51:45] seven shortages
[51:48] and I think we can see them laid out
[51:52] there it is
[51:54] and that's like demonstrate a second
[51:57] time
[51:59] the church has been one Church
[52:03] all the way from Ephesus
[52:08] it has been the same church
[52:11] which has moved
[52:14] and now has produced those that are us
[52:21] so now the first church age was the
[52:25] physics
[52:27] Christ was in the church
[52:32] failed in the people um
[52:37] he saw him walking through the seven
[52:39] golden Candles
[52:42] now these men here
[52:45] they represent the light of the Holy
[52:48] Spirit
[52:49] the pillar of fire
[52:51] that came upon the church
[52:56] that was the light
[52:58] that was the candle so the children of
[53:02] God
[53:06] the Bible says
[53:12] they became the next Church
[53:17] never church was born
[53:21] now they find another challenge
[53:25] and their commissioned to overcome
[53:29] and when they overcome amen amen they do
[53:34] you know become this church here
[53:37] and so now this church here which you
[53:42] are seeing here is the continuation of
[53:45] the same
[54:27] foreign foreign
[55:28] energy
[55:37] when it comes down here so all the
[55:42] revelation of the world
[56:04] [Music]
[56:19] Jesus stood right here yes
[56:43] amen Amina that's where the food for the
[56:47] bread is
[56:52] they rejected but then we are brought
[56:55] down here into the bridge
[57:00] this is where you find the brightest
[57:03] food
[57:05] the washing Waters
[57:17] it's given severeign
[57:28] [Music]
[57:43] foreign
[57:54] and we are here exactly why not waiting
[57:58] to be body changed into the Mirage
[58:04] so this is when the church has a
[58:08] stretched out
[58:11] but then you can have another view of
[58:14] the church
[58:16] the church
[58:18] is
[58:21] gave me that diagram also Foundation the
[58:25] church is
[58:45] at different states
[58:49] like the church had the step work
[58:53] you could today
[59:00] [Music]
[59:24] that's where we asked church
[59:27] amen Amina many times
[59:31] anyway we shall look at it as we go
[59:34] ahead
[59:35] when the Bible speaks about the word
[59:38] being said
[59:42] amen amen the concepts
[59:45] is about a scroll
[59:50] they didn't have books with the pages
[59:55] it was a scroll
[59:58] and so the inner scroll come to Amazon
[1:00:03] was the first sea I didn't scroll
[1:00:08] and now it was sealed
[1:00:14] you can use a suit up here
[1:00:20] and then you call it a seal
[1:00:23] and then you bring your second one
[1:00:27] and then another one
[1:00:31] and they are all seven
[1:00:43] you have to first of all break the outer
[1:00:47] seal which is the seventh sea why not
[1:00:50] soccer community
[1:01:58] that if you have got something precious
[1:02:02] day you keep it on the seat
[1:02:05] you don't just put it in the sitting
[1:02:08] room
[1:02:09] where every Thief can come and take or
[1:02:12] maybe
[1:02:13] when I was growing up as a young
[1:02:16] Pentecostal boy
[1:02:20] 1975
[1:02:22] before many of you were born
[1:02:26] I was reading a book
[1:02:29] and now in this book
[1:02:31] The Man Who was talking about wisdom um
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:37] he had the money in the house
[1:02:44] when the fifth came the money began to
[1:02:47] pray
[1:02:48] Heavenly Father keep my money
[1:02:52] which is in the shoes
[1:02:55] the thief just went for the show maybe
[1:02:57] again
[1:03:03] that's not how you keep something
[1:03:05] precious
[1:03:30] you know sometimes there's no life
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:37] when people avoid the seals
[1:03:43] when they avoid the things which are
[1:03:46] hidden ideas
[1:03:50] in the time of the eyes
[1:03:55] [Music]
[1:03:57] because the eyes on the head
[1:04:00] and we are on the edge of the Earth
[1:04:04] are you together that's the time when
[1:04:07] God
[1:04:11] so that these things can give you
[1:04:13] eternal life
[1:04:17] are you together with me amen amen so
[1:04:21] Revelation chapter five very quickly the
[1:04:24] Bible speaks about a book
[1:04:27] amen Amina now he says here in verse 1.
[1:04:32] so in the right hand of him that sat on
[1:04:36] the throne
[1:04:38] a book written within and at the
[1:04:41] backside sealed with Seven Seas
[1:04:46] now he was Seated on the throne
[1:04:51] the book was in the right hand of
[1:04:54] authority
[1:04:56] and because he was in the throne
[1:05:05] there were four gods that were guarding
[1:05:10] the full living creatures nobody
[1:05:17] foreign
[1:05:40] [Music]
[1:05:49] [Laughter]
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:11] [Music]
[1:06:40] hallelujah praise the Lord so let us
[1:06:44] look at these things
[1:06:57] because
[1:07:00] he was pretending to be Christ
[1:07:04] because Christ in Revelation 19.
[1:07:08] he comes right in the White House
[1:07:14] was trying to pose as Christ yeah
[1:07:17] foreign
[1:07:36] [Music]
[1:08:04] Hallelujah
[1:08:25] was the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:08:29] the knowledge
[1:08:36] so in the Second Street
[1:08:39] the enemy was already a red host Rider
[1:08:43] movies
[1:08:44] because the people had rejected him
[1:08:48] he gets the sword yeah
[1:08:53] amen amen but the power man that sealed
[1:08:57] the names
[1:09:03] the anointing that labors in difficult
[1:09:06] conditions
[1:09:11] and also an animal of sacrifice
[1:09:17] than give up the world
[1:09:21] that anointing Came Upon the time
[1:09:24] 6 30 million I mean people died
[1:09:30] but they could not let go
[1:09:34] they were anointed
[1:09:36] to be sacrificed so that they can hold
[1:09:41] eternal life
[1:09:42] now the first suit
[1:09:48] the enemy was a black horse ride um
[1:09:53] but the power Iron Man that sealed the
[1:09:57] names
[1:10:06] to combat the Wilds of the enemies
[1:10:14] he tried to become the word
[1:10:17] but the people could not take it
[1:10:21] now he took a sword
[1:10:24] I'll kill them
[1:10:27] but the people say we would rather die
[1:10:30] now in the first
[1:10:33] he comes as a black horse rider
[1:10:39] he takes away the world
[1:10:45] he takes away the light of the word from
[1:10:47] the people
[1:10:50] that's why it's called the black horse
[1:10:53] and he created in what we call the Dark
[1:10:57] Ages in history
[1:11:02] because the people were not Guided by
[1:11:04] the word anymore
[1:11:07] and I want you to know that where we are
[1:11:11] intellectually bad spirits of the black
[1:11:15] horse
[1:11:22] amen Amina now what I want us to go and
[1:11:26] read about the third seal in the queen
[1:11:29] that we can show me because I'm still
[1:11:32] laying a foundation
[1:11:34] Revelation chapter 6 verse 5.
[1:11:38] and when he had opened the first seal
[1:11:41] your current team
[1:11:43] I have the fat to be said come and see
[1:11:49] and I beheld them low a black house
[1:12:01] now if you were here for the first time
[1:12:05] you are wondering where we are getting
[1:12:07] the living creatures
[1:12:13] you can get them in Revelation chapter
[1:12:16] four
[1:12:17] because they gathered in the throne
[1:12:22] the first one had the image of a life
[1:12:26] the second one had the uh Festival Knox
[1:12:35] I mean the likeness of the first of a
[1:12:38] man no works
[1:12:40] and then the fourth one had the likeness
[1:12:44] of a flying eagle
[1:12:47] so those were the living creatures
[1:12:56] according to the world
[1:12:58] you were also in the throne
[1:13:01] because you were in the book
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:07] foreign
[1:13:57] now I'm going to say a few things
[1:14:01] when one denies people
[1:14:04] some sections of this message
[1:14:09] when somebody denies the people some
[1:14:13] sections of this message
[1:14:19] then he will be riding a black horse
[1:14:23] among the people
[1:14:30] Amen in that era
[1:14:35] the word was withdrawn
[1:14:38] and it was replaced by the sureness
[1:14:45] of developing theologies
[1:14:50] they started giving people novenas
[1:14:57] and the documents
[1:14:59] instead of the world
[1:15:05] now the church then
[1:15:08] was ran on liturgies
[1:15:23] who believes that he has got a
[1:15:26] revelation
[1:15:30] he writes
[1:15:32] a document and sends it over to the
[1:15:37] people
[1:15:38] with the scriptures we are going to read
[1:15:43] and how to apply them
[1:15:49] those of you who were out in those
[1:15:51] churches
[1:15:55] today's portion is in the Book of Mark
[1:15:58] it is
[1:15:59] from The Book of Mark those are
[1:16:01] liturgies
[1:16:05] and one so now when that one came
[1:16:10] and the church was evoked by Darkness
[1:16:15] a man having you know the spirit of God
[1:16:20] upon him
[1:16:24] his name was Martin Luther it is
[1:16:46] and that was now what opened up what we
[1:16:50] call in history the time of the
[1:16:52] Reformation
[1:16:58] foreign
[1:17:33] foreign
[1:17:52] when I went for a funeral
[1:17:55] of a relative of brother Ben or brother
[1:17:59] Ben are you here
[1:18:02] yeah
[1:18:04] it should be why I'm seeing him here
[1:18:06] again
[1:18:09] you know they were Catholics
[1:18:13] and after the funeral service
[1:18:20] to bring money
[1:18:22] so that the soul
[1:18:25] could be brought from purgatory
[1:18:29] to be taken to heaven
[1:18:36] foreign
[1:19:06] yes sir brother Ben I think that's right
[1:19:10] they collected the money
[1:19:12] they were trying to pray for this man so
[1:19:15] that he cannot uh uh perish in hell
[1:19:19] now for you people who really do not
[1:19:23] know where the Prosperity Gospel came
[1:19:27] from
[1:19:32] you are going to get your Millions
[1:19:35] if you bring this
[1:19:38] one that's where this comes from
[1:19:44] listen to what your Prophet says
[1:19:49] that third piece that Satan sent out yes
[1:19:54] he becomes shrewd
[1:19:57] a mess of which foreign
[1:20:09] or um interview
[1:21:10] foreign
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:40] and there is this thing which was going
[1:21:42] around I don't know how many of you have
[1:21:44] heard of it
[1:21:46] he has this Minister saying
[1:21:50] hey
[1:21:52] that Spirit told me
[1:21:55] they are people who doesn't know me
[1:22:00] who doesn't know that you you can you
[1:22:03] can give him anywhere
[1:22:06] if he if your house has got here you
[1:22:10] cannot stop
[1:22:15] thank you
[1:22:17] I said come on God
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:21] how can people do things like this
[1:22:24] but it comes from that era
[1:22:27] and then the prophet says making all the
[1:22:31] people give up their pensions
[1:22:36] their homes over certain things
[1:22:41] so the Prosperity Gospel
[1:22:44] is an anointing from that era family so
[1:22:49] therefore
[1:22:50] Pentecost pedagogy is not under the ego
[1:22:54] anointing
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:56] are you together with me yeah Pentecost
[1:23:01] is under the Reformation
[1:23:04] that is under the ego and you always
[1:23:08] amen Amina so now from today we want to
[1:23:13] look at the bridge
[1:23:15] from a wide perspective
[1:23:19] we shall stand at different dimensions
[1:23:22] to view it
[1:23:25] gave me the linear edges here so that we
[1:23:29] can really be able to view
[1:23:31] the bridge of Kingdom in different
[1:23:34] dimensions
[1:23:46] the linear one is the one I want
[1:23:51] the church is in a line
[1:23:56] you got it
[1:23:58] yeah
[1:23:59] so
[1:24:01] now right here
[1:24:04] oh again
[1:24:07] you know Lord this you're here
[1:24:10] they looked out to Christ
[1:24:12] and the Christ came out praise we have
[1:24:16] value and he says behold they stand out
[1:24:18] in the door no yeah
[1:24:21] my voice
[1:24:30] and the Christ is the door
[1:24:32] that brings you to the bridge
[1:24:38] are you together with me at the End of
[1:24:41] the Age
[1:24:43] after Christ has been rejected
[1:24:47] he will have to stand again
[1:24:52] so that the people
[1:24:54] can you discover but their salvation
[1:24:59] that's why when Johnny was called out
[1:25:02] into the bridge
[1:25:09] coming foreign
[1:25:13] [Applause]
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:26:02] to look at the bridge from a different
[1:26:05] perspective
[1:26:08] so in the bridge between the church
[1:26:12] edges here that is
[1:26:17] [Music]
[1:26:21] praise God Christ himself please win it
[1:26:25] seals that bridge
[1:26:28] [Applause]
[1:26:47] the reward
[1:26:50] foreign
[1:27:18] origin
[1:27:28] John chapter 10.
[1:27:31] I am the door to the Sheep
[1:27:35] now in Israel
[1:27:38] when a Shepherd brought back his ship
[1:27:43] oh before that they suffered um spoke in
[1:27:48] a certain way
[1:27:55] they could go about ten Shepherds
[1:28:02] into the posture but if the time is over
[1:28:06] for the
[1:28:09] belonging to this
[1:28:14] woman
[1:28:15] he just speaks in a certain way
[1:28:19] and they would start following him
[1:29:20] he slept in the door
[1:29:24] and the ship respected him so much
[1:29:28] Hallelujah
[1:29:37] my brother so that you may know
[1:29:41] that the shepherd into um
[1:29:56] the bridge chapter of Kingdom as we
[1:29:59] looked at it the other time
[1:30:01] May mean a whole she insulted the
[1:30:05] secretary
[1:30:06] foreign
[1:30:50] to be able to get access into the bridge
[1:30:57] amen Amina I am the door
[1:31:01] to the bridge
[1:31:10] and as long as the shepherd was in the
[1:31:13] door
[1:31:15] he became the security
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:20] Hallelujah
[1:31:23] in the doors
[1:31:41] from anything that cannot go through
[1:31:44] that door
[1:31:47] there is no other thing that can go
[1:31:50] through the door
[1:31:57] brother Fox cannot go through that
[1:32:01] Jesus himself
[1:32:03] as the door yeah
[1:32:19] which we call
[1:32:22] come up either
[1:32:26] you remember Revelation chapter 4 verse
[1:32:28] one right now after those things
[1:32:35] after Jesus was locked down
[1:32:39] Jesus was locked out of the church yes
[1:32:44] in the denominational churches
[1:32:48] they don't reason in the terms of what
[1:32:50] Christ says
[1:32:52] because when he says I've refused the
[1:32:56] woman to preach
[1:33:00] if she preaches what happened in Christ
[1:33:03] being locked
[1:33:06] foreign
[1:33:18] after they rejected
[1:33:24] my brother you need to come through that
[1:33:28] door

[1:33:34] is that open door
[1:33:36] which also takes you in a space
[1:33:40] which is called the bridge

[1:34:52] is the bridge between the church ages
[1:34:55] and the Sea you know what you know what
[1:34:57] that is
[1:34:59] the fourth chapter
[1:35:03] of Revelation
[1:35:05] in that it kind of revealed something
[1:35:10] what would take place after the church
[1:35:13] going up
[1:35:16] so he's telling you that the bridge

[1:37:56] amen Amina so we need to stand on a
[1:38:00] pedestal Twitter
[1:38:02] amen Amina and bring out the several
[1:38:05] views of the bridge
[1:38:09] now the prophet himself says
[1:38:12] for out of the edges
[1:38:15] back to the linear chat
[1:38:19] out of the edges
[1:38:21] comes the seals and out of the seals
[1:38:26] come the trumpets
[1:38:35] let's go back to the chat
[1:38:39] foreign
[1:38:48] [Music]
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:21] so

[1:41:40] amen Amina and all these seals
[1:41:44] were breaking during the southern
[1:41:46] charges
[1:41:49] but why does he call the bridge
[1:41:52] a position between the church edges and
[1:41:55] the series
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:42:00] we want to understand that
[1:42:03] amen Amina
[1:42:05] Pentecost is not particles of the ego
[1:42:09] anointing
[1:42:11] as we explain I'll give you this quote

[1:42:35] the Pentecostal age
[1:42:43] has to restore yeah we cannot deny his
[1:42:47] word

[2:12:37] Jews foreign

[2:16:08] and then in that Union
[2:16:12] there must come alive
[2:16:18] who is the perfect man
[2:16:22] but I take the structure by way of Union
[2:16:30] this is what is happening in the bridge
[2:16:31] here
[2:16:34] as the bridegroom being the word and the
[2:16:38] bride being the here of the word they

[2:20:20] everything to him
[2:20:24] which is the fullness which is Among Us
[2:20:29] the fullness of redemption
