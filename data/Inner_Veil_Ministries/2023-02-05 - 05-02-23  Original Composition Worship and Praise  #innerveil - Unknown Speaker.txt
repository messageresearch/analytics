all welcome into the presence of the Lord amen amen so Revelation chapter 8 verse 1. and when he adopted the seventh seals there was Silence about the space of half an hour you see that's a tremendous fact the opening of the seventh seals brought silence in heaven the Angels there was no movement and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar um now I want you to see that Seven Angels were given having a golden sensor that should offer it with the prayers of All Saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hands may the Lord that blessing the reading of his wife you may be seated so before we go into our wasp with the song this morning uh we want to look at the subject or title of the service as worshiping under the seventh seal um [Music] amen Amina so man before the fall okay man enjoyed fellowship with God always visiting the cool of the day they always have an evening time service but then Fellowship was lost When sin came in pulled back from fellowship with God but God was determined to bridge that gap which was created by sin he determined to bridge it by a blood redempts man had trusted in a self restoration when it took a step and sold fig leaves and made themselves apron and you know when it's so bright and Shining Hots you know that apron would almost I mean would completely Sprint and break [Music] foreign doors of fellowship with God what time but eternally would bring man into Shadows of his presence not that direct presence amen amen any questions what time is it talking about the time when Christ came down Amen to perform a Redemption amen so The Sinner Man [Applause] he says [Music] but we [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] receives the revelation of the fullness of redemption that comes by the opening of the seventh sea um so out of out of your this year where Christ makes himself known to the bride yeah so in Revelation foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign because right now foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] [Applause] um but you now realize this is not the time to cry this is a time to join the Heavenly hosts because we have had the sales commanded open from the book that we couldn't travel and the book is open and you see your name how do you see your name by seeing the revelation of the world quick you have seen your name you realize this was written for me and then you take it by faith amen Amina let's go to Revelation chapter five foreign [Applause] [Music] and lose the same zero yeah and now in the midst of the throne another four days and the minister of the elders together with me foreign [Applause] John weep not you cannot the lion of the tribe of Judah hallelujah hallelujah has prevailed now John was being told about a lion now the lion of the tribe of Judah was the official recognition of the king of Israel no quality is are you together with me when is it and so John come to your corner when it's time to see we are the governor he could not see a lion he could see Allah Hallelujah Hallelujah to the world he stands as a child but when he steps out I prefer you to deal with us because he's coming down with Grace is coming to join himself to the body of the church so John right there the revelations to work how many people run to America have been saved I'm not sure of their salvation but Revelation chapter five of our Salvation Hallelujah and he was still bloody Academy [Music] he looks like he had been to battle and he said it is foreign foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] it brings such a glorious job amen Amina I'm the four big seed amen amen amen I mean that's before I mean all of the four living creatures amen amen when you sing your songs because we are coming to worship but we are realizing that this is not the worship that was through the sovereign foreign so therefore kind of Rachel you have to step fourth yeah to break the seals brother Branham we're gonna bring him in the bridge message says the mystery of Gods of God God sealed in this mysterious seals is finished meaning the seventh and against one example reveals what's on the inside of the six series amen amen I did not come prepared for this United States but when you are speaking about uh it was to see the sick Rose so now brother Branham demonstration says then there is a seal put here then they brought the second around this and also sealed with the straps and they brought the fat body the only way you can get through this is by breaking the seventh first there's no way you can get on the inside unless the seventh is broken okay okay then the mystery of God that is sealed in this mysterious are you together with me when is it so it attacks the seventh seeds to release the Plan of Redemption amen amen because the straw I mean the Scrolls that were being opened if you can listen to me it was the seal foreign are you together with the man is it it sealed the world yes so the opening of the seals is to open what lays behind the World by putting it under symbols when he opened the first seal yeah so once God sends a prophet Indian time the minister of Malachi is to break those symbols for us so he takes 5 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16. which says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven the Lord and foreign haha you know the Lord himself the Lord himself what does that mean it means but our spirit being is steps forward to break the seals of the book okay but uses that means who can look into the silence and then bring your message out of the silence when kingdom is when he dreamed a dream we allowed and came to Daniel yeah and says but I don't remember it took Daniel a prophet to go into that silence bring out a message for the King when he opened the sovereign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] when you open the facilities but the message was in there and the prophet goes under that message amen amen to bring it down for us he says the Lord himself he does not ever glorify anybody glorify anybody is foreign [Applause] he had stepped down yarika he said the Lord himself not with that body yet but that anointing stepped down I am afraid that lived in the Jesus under that anointing and bring a message out of Silence the Angels hushed their singing in heaven cellophane they are showing the temples three sets of wings [Music] foreign [Applause] bicycle the Angels quit singing flying in their presence in the presence of God singing No Angel singing no praises there was silence deadless silence in heaven foreign he broke it into yet they were held by itself they didn't know there it was they just stopped yeah what is it are you together with me so the seal this seal the seventh seals is the one which was holding the end time message is the love no matter opening the book of redemption are you together with me so this seventh seals have horse the mysteries of the coming of the Lord so some of it is foreign [Applause] [Music] only [Applause] and when this one came they don't know he stood up to the altar yeah having a golden system and he was given unto himself which was before the throne foreign [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah let us look at the qualities of this engine and then we shall know who this Center is the Bible says he stood at the house to receive the prayers can I tell you something none can receive the prayers of the Saints but the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Among Us the fullness [Applause] and there was given her to him by Jesus with the prayers of foreign amen amen Leviticus 16 12 [Applause] so the out of [Applause] [Music] we we see the angel of the Covenant holding the essence not to qualify himself take away to Kanye because it's already perfect but that our prayers God before the presence of God the Bible says which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God turned down out of the Angels let me tell you when he came down he had incense waiting for your prayers and your prayers with the smoke of the Earth because he was still in a negative conditions [Music] to escort your prayers [Applause] because the sacrifices he didn't bring the border with him the Lord himself descendants but to the Border remained that's the sacrifice that stands between you and your sins that's your only assurance [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it is the prophet says here as I'm finishing amen notice not this now checking nobody [Music] [Applause] foreign there has to be a place right now quite fun where the slain lands where the blood is the Bible says if there is that no sacrifice your prayers the prayers and because we were not worthy the Lord himself amen amen and that when you pray that's right your prayers mix with this kind of pieces to wear the sacrifice and today hello we have got an intercessor how could we ever known it is unless there was the opening of those things unless there was the opening of the servants I'm going to look at the church has got the anointing of George God bless you [Music] [Music] foreign oh praise the name of our Lord we appreciate our
