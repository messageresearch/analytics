father again we approach your throne of grace and mercy and Sur we are here to tell you all our burdens and TRS for you care in everything and now we got the opening of the word you've Tau us heavenly father that the word did not come by the desire of man but the holy men of God we are moved by the Holy Spirit and you also Tau Us in this end time that you interpret your own word you therefore come and interpret us your word according to the STS we have and also what we have need of that you may speak to us personally and help each and every one of us to have a personal relationship with you that can be better than it has ever been before we love you and we thank you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus and ask this amen so Psalms 32 we're reading in verse one I had forgotten also brother Henry is in IMA Henry M so so just keep him in your prayers amen so Psalms 32 verse 1 to verse 8 says blessed is he whose transgression Is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no gu when I kept silence my bones worked out through my roaring all day long for day and night thy hand was Heavy upon me my for this shall everyone that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when th found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him though at my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from travel thou shal Compass me about with songs of Deliverance Sarah I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go I'll guide thee with mine eye verse what may seated so I want to preach on the subject recognizing your weakness praise the name of the Lord recognizing your weakness and it is actually very important for each and every one of us to know our weaknesses praise the name of our Lord in one way or another you find yourself there is weakness there is something that is not adding up there is something that is not right there is something that you're not happy with in your life there's something that actually you know like frustrates you praise the name of our Lord so here in verse five David says I acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity I not H I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and th forgest the iniquity of my sin praise the name of our Lord he said I will acknowledge my sin I will not hide it but I will tell say Lord this is my area of Lord this is where I fa Lord this is where I'm beaten down that's why David was confessing that I will not hide my iniquity but I will acknowledge it I will say it is me who has done this it's me Lord who has a problem it's me Lord among us it's me who hates another it's me who has a bad spirit it's me who has a bad heart it's me who steals it's me who does prostitution it's me who drinks it's me who does this words you are acknowledging it before God when you acknowledge it before God and cry Lord have mercy upon praise the name of our Lord recognizing our weaknesses before the Lord and then you call upon the name of the Lord Lord help me in this area Lord there is a challenge I have in my life I want you to come in this area and then work upon it mold me praise the name of our Lord in the way that is pleasing unto you praise the name of our Lord so then the Bible says I will not hide my iniquity but I will confess by transgression to the Lord and when you confess to the Lord then the Bible says then the Lord forgives you praise the name of the the Lord forgives you praise the name of our Lord but then you see where the challenge comes in is when you hide your sin when you hide your weakness and you are not able to declare it before the Lord and then you tell Lord this is my weakness Lord this is my failure and you know genine [Music] repentance is you know to come and tell God about yourself praise the name of our Lord like David when David went and committed adultery and then he murdered and then the prophet came to David and told David that you are the man David did not just start kind of doing something else he admitted his weaknesses he admitted his sin and said Lord surely I am the man whatever you are saying is the truth everything you've talked about me like the woman at the word he said he has told me everything and that's the simp bis when we come to the Lord you know you don't come to hide anything because the Lord knows everything so you're not doing well to hide anything from God now when you come before the Lord you declare your condition so Lord I'm not good here Lord I have a weakness here Lord I have a failure here so let us go to Psalms 51 praise the name of our Lord and then verse one the Bible says to the chief musician a of David when Nathan the prophet came unto him after he had gone into BBA may not have those words but just interpret then David says have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according to the m of thy Tender Mercies BL out my transgression you know you see how David is approaching the Lord Lord surely I'm the problem Sur I'm the one who has committed adter the one who has murdered so have mercy upon you then he says wash me thary from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin praise the name of our Lord he calling upon the name of the Lord says lord I can't help myself I can't deliver myself out of this so I'm depending upon your grace to come and deliver me out of my weakness come and deliver me out of blood guilt then inse three acknowledges he's confessing he's recognizing his weakness says for I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me your weakness before you bring it to the Lord said Lord this is my weakness this is my failure this is my sin Lord acknowledge it Lord this is where I fail this is where I am limited then he then he says acknowledge my sin my sin is ever before me against you and you only have I seen and done this evil in your sight that you may be justified when you speak and be clear when you judge saying nothing whatever you are saying is correct praise the name of you know David a king he humbled himself and when the prophet came to the king and told the king his problem David never started arguing with the K he never started saying don't you know that I'm a man after God's Own don't you know that God anointed me by a great proph called who are to come to that was not David praise the name of you know he had a heart like the heart of God you know he said Lord this is my transgression this is my sin I admit my weaknesses and you see that's what the Lord wants us also to do to admit our weaknesses recognize our failures and say Lord this is where I'm failing Lord this is the condition that bothers me praise the name of our David he never argued with the prophet but then when you read in some scriptures you find that when a king is told of his weakness they they kind of punish that Prophet but but to David it was not so a man with a right heart and should also be the same thing with us that when the word of God identifies our weak areas you said Lord have mercy upon Min praise the name of our Lord you don't take it to be against the minister why is it talking against me why is it spoiling my name why is it that I do this and this if it is true you do it say Lord have mer supp praise the name of our lord it's not good that we hide our sins it's not good that we hide our weaknesses but then you bring it before the Lord and ask the mercies of God come in your weakness to come in your area and that's how you can be helped that's how you can be delivered praise the name of our Lord in Proverbs 28 and then verse3 the Bible says he that covers his sins shall not Prosper but soever confesses and forsakes them Shall Have Mercy 18 28 verse 13 verse 14 praise the name of our Lord so he says he that covers his sin shall not Prosper so you don't cover your sins you don't cover your weakness so you bring it and confess it before the Lord and say Lord this is my area of Lord this is where I'm failing Lord this is where the devil is holding me down praise the name of our Lord whenever I get my phone and I have dat on my phone I go to bad things and I take time on bad things Facebook or Tik Tok or YouTube you know feeding things which are not right that's your weakness so then you declare it before the Lord no this is the problem that most of my time I spend it on L most of my time I spend it on backbiting most of my time I spend it on abusing others most of my time I spend it despising others most of my time I spend it seeing how I can frustrate others you know you declare it to the Lord and say Lord this is the point he has Mercy other words when I confess like David I have committed adultery I have murdered he confessed and for and that should be the same thing praise the name of our Lord if I know my weakness is ring praise the name of our Lord you know Spirits keep on attracting one another when brother Bram would identify a certain disease in a particular person when he Discerning then he would see darkness in the different parts of the congregation demons calling to one another to defend this one here say that this one doesn't leave and then now when he sees that kind of situation then he tells all the people people with you know you know maybe this kind of condition stand up on your feet then cast out that demon so now you find that somebody who has an evil spirit in that evil spirit in you will identify another person with the same evil spirit and you find you become friends with that person cuz you're feeding from the same thing is rering your best friend is a Rumer then you can just get and each each and every person brings more other brings this the other brings this other BRS other and then time goes so then you need to see that you forsake that if you know this person is Rong and I want to overcome Rong avoid Fellowship on praise the name of our Lord not asking have you had this you have not had there also this also brings another so you confess and forsake praise the name of our Lord if the weakness is going to the bar there's a particular friend of yours who called you to go to the bar then you know that I have to cut off contact with this person I have to cut off contact going to such a place you know you are forsaking you are you are actually the Bible says let us go to first Thessalonians chapter 5 praise the name of our Lord first thians chapter 5 and then we go to ver let me get the verse here we go to verse 20 we go to verse 22 okay start from verse 20 it says prove all things hold first that which is good says proof all things if it is not good leave it if it is good says hold it then verse 22 abstain from all appearance of evil appearance of evil you've not done it you've not got into it but when you know that there's something evil there avoid praise the name of our Lord avoid it you know they are like now sometimes an example is this maybe at school or at University or at place of work you have end of your party and now maybe they going to choose you with another woman man to open the dance why would you be there but you know our company policy no stand for what is right don't say you know I was caught up in a sttion you avoid that appearance of evil praise the name of our you avoid places where you know nothing is discussed but evil you know like clubs you know there's nothing good they discuss there why would you go to a club why would you sit in a bar you know all around people are drinking beers for you also there then they said this not a joke then you also receive it then also you throw back another you are actually defiling yourself so you avoid that you abstain from that praise the name of our Lord you know this place they do this kind of things you avoid it you live things that are not right to keep yourself pure praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says in Proverbs 28:4 happy is the man that fear all in other words you have the fear of God you don't want to be identified with evil you don't want to go into associations of evil doers you don't want to be identified with people are doing wrong it's the fear of God that keeps you from going into such kind of areas then the Bible says but he that hardens his heart shall fall into Mischief so when you harden your heart what is to harden your heart you don't care ah me I'm strong enough I will not fall by that you know you are hardening your heart but you need to see that you flee evil you abstain from evil but you say me I'm strong I can't fall you are hardening your heart praise the name of you are just on where you are maybe renting your neighbors every morning they busy discussing about people you abstain from that you don't go and associate with them no but for me I know how to keep quiet but what are you receiving from them because there are demons coming from them you and not long you'll be doing the same and always the devil wants where to S he always seeks where to S now for you have hardened your heart so the devil can so there so we need to see that we avoid all the things that are contrary to the word of God praise the name of our Lord let us go to Proverbs 28 again verse 9 Proverbs praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says he that turth away his ear from hearing the law even his prayer shall be abomination praise the name of Lord he says you refuse instruction you refuse counsel you know you refuse to be guided ah me I don't care what they say then the Bible says even your prayer is Abomination because youve hardened your heart praise the name of our Lord in other words you're not ready to be led by the spirit the spirit is telling you live this kind of the spirit is telling you don't go to that place you say me I don't care me I can overcome that then the Bible says even your prayer is an abomination because you have rejected to hear the word so then God says I will also not hear you that's what the scripture say so in zear 7 and then verse 11 the Bible says but they refused to Heen and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should do not hear zecharia 7: 11 Z for yeah they made their hearts as a damant stone lest they should hear the law and the words which the Lord of host had sent in his Spirit by the former prophets therefore came a great wrath from The Lord of hosts therefore it it is come to pass that as he cried and they would not hear so they cried and I not hear says the Lord of hosts he says if you don't hear me then I also not hear you now so we need to see that we are obedient to the word of God and as the Lord speaks to us then we have hearts of Flesh that can receive if we know there something wrong that we have done then you said Lord help me in this kind of area deliver me from my weaknesses I need your help praise the name of our and then he says if you don't hear the word then the Lord also will not hear your prayers so he says your prayer is an Abomination because you've refused to hear instruction but when you hear instruction and Obey instruction then you confess your sins and then you forsake them and then now you can pray to the Lord and then the Lord can hear you praise the name of our Lord he can hear your prayers because there's nothing between you and him you know you are doing something which is right before God so the Lord is delighted in your prayer praise the name of our Lord like in the scriptures in Proverbs 15 he says the sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord but the prayer of the upright is his Delight verse The Way of the Wicked is an Abomination unto the Lord but he loveth him that follows after righteousness correction is Grievous unto him that forsaketh the way and he that hateth reproof shall die praise the name of our Lord so he says the sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord so the prayer is just an Abomination whatever that is doing for the Lord is an Abomination but now when the upright praise God is delighted in his prayer then says The Way of the Wicked is an Abomination unto the Lord but he love him that follows after righteous and that should always be our desire to follow righteousness to follow the word of God not to follow groups not to follow this one or follow the other one but we need to see that we follow the word of God and then do that which is right before do that which is acceptable before the Lord that's how the Lord wants us to be praise the name of our Lord that you know you hate sin like job heed evil and you know he didn't want do anything contrary to praise the name of our Lord and when job was keeping himself in that condition then the Lord would hear his pray praise the name of our Lord when his friends testified against him his friends then God told told them go to job job him will I he when he prays praise the name of our Lord we also need to be in that kind of condition that God can hear our prayers praise the name of the Lord the same thing with Abraham God told AB go to Abraham he's my Prophet then he prays for you then I will heal you PR so we need to see that we have the same kind of you know condition before God that we are acceptable before the Lord our life is acceptable before the Lord our you know prayer is acceptable before the Lord you know when I stand before the Lord you know I'm speaking the truth from my heart you know I'm not hiding about you know there are some people who are smart he tells you this when the heart is on something else that's not how we need to be before the Lord David was telling Solomon in 1 chonicles 28 and then verse it says and th Solomon my son know the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the Lord searches all hearts and understand all imaginations of the thoughts if you seek Him He will be found of you but if you forsake Him He will cast you a far off so he says seek the Lord serve the Lord with a perfect heart with a willing mind praise the name of our Lord you need to be genuine before the Lord you not hiding something not pretending over something but you know your heart being upright before the praise the name of our Lord if there is Iniquity somewhere you acknowledge it before the Lord he said Lord have mercy upon me in this are Lord deliver me in this kind of weakness and then when you do that God knowing that you you know that there's something wrong before you and then Lord have mercy upon you then the Lord forgives you and hears your prayer praise the name of our Lord that's the kind of life we need to live every other day praise the name of our Lord a life of repentance and forgiveness that is a continuous life in our Christian world that every day in one way or another you've done something wrong you have thought something wrong you've spoken something wrong then when you come before the Lord Lord have mercy upon me wash me from my weaknesses wash me from my failur and then you are bringing the the spirit of God you bringing the spirit of God to be friendly with you you know to have fellowship with you praise the name of our Lord you know you need to be genuine he says a perfect heart and a willing mind there's nothing you are hiding praise the name of our Lord but these days we have smart people he says this but he's meaning something else and then you start wondering what to do said but he told me this then he says but I didn't tell you that then you start wondering you know Paul says in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 praise the name of our Lord and then verse one says therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man is conscious in the sight of God praise the name of our Lord he says we have renounced hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness not handling the word of God deceitfully but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscious in the sight of God praise the name he says we have renounced hidden things of this you know just like the Pharisees when the Pharisees when they came to John the Baptist they ask John who are you no they they say we don't understand you and they rejected the baptism of John when they come to Jesus Christ they ask him who gave you that power they just rejected the councel of God they were walking in this honesty they were just crafted people you know people who are you know like double dealers he says this but it means another so when they came to Jesus Christ and then they were asking Jesus Christ who gave you that power then Jesus asked them the baptism of John is it of men or it's of God they excused themselves let us go to a conference then they went and discuss then they said and there were many people around now if we say that the baptism of John is of men these people around they us now if Jesus was alone they would have told him of men but because there were people who were their congregation they fear the people would Stone them because they believed that John was a prophet then they said ah we don't want to be Stone what do we do then they said because the question was this or this now they refused to choose any of them but they knew what exactly the truth is and then they say if we tell him that it's of God which is true and which people believe then will ask us why didn't you receive John craftiness dishonesty so what did they do we tell him we don't know craftiness and there are some people their lives they move like that today it as if it is white the following day you find gray double standards you know then the other day it is black and black comes when they're in darkness you know just kind of like pretense craftiness and Paul is saying that we have renounced hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness not Hing the word of God deceitfully you know you are not deceiving on the word of praise the name of our Lord you know just like you know the religious world love one another love one another but behind here they sewing hatred that's what they are promoting so Paul says we have renounced those kind of praise the name of our Lord we just want to be upright before the Lord we just want to do what the Lord wants us to do praise the name of our Lord in the message faith without works is dead he says now you couldn't have powered enough oil on her Anointed with oil you couldn't have stopped or or the devil don't care how loud you H he don't pay no attention to that that's right but he will recognize Faith he will have to know where the truth lays and recognize the truth and recognize faith and if you've got something that's the reason I watch cloth now on these lines like we are going to have tonight we just pray for the people and lay hands on them and so forth that's the way that's going to be up to you so you confess your sins before you come to the platform and say Lord anything that's in your life you straighten it up from now before you come for be it assured to you that that thing which will hang right over you as long as you got un confessed sin or maybe something in your life that you should you should have done that you did not do maybe something you did that you ought not to have done but any of those Lord have mercy upon me this kind I want to do that which is right I want to follow instructions I want to be right before you I want to live a true life before you you know you are not hiding you're not hiding your sin and then the Bible says if you hide your sin you shall not Prosper so then you want to declare your weaknesses before God and Lord this is my area of weakness this is my failure this is why I'm ever failing praise the name of our Lord and then that's how the Lord can come and help you praise the name of our Lord but then if you don't then there you not going to overcome God reveals it if there is anything wrong then you make that right your healing is complete praise the name of our Lord he say Satan will keep there because you have not confessed it praise the name of our Lord so then you acknowledge your weakness like David he acknowledged this weakness slow this is my weakness Lord this is my area of failure in the message how the angel came to me he says in a few minutes here they come back up the steps tears streaming down their cheeks her Satan lost his hold on them now there is where it is at now that settled it but as long as that sin was under there no matter how loud you would scream how hard you would how much all you pour on how loud you pray easy you pray or whatever you do that devil will stay right there why he has a as long as you got UNC confessed sin he just stays there that's what brother is telling us when you have unconfessed sin when you don't acknowledge your sin he says Satan has got a right to stay there because you have his own because sin is of the devil and now for you have something wrong you did and you're refusing to acknowledge it so the devil stays there because you have his good stays there so you need to reject the good of the devil and then the devil will go away you have no more company you have no more Association in that kind of area of your weakness and said I acknowledge my weakness acknowledge my sin acknowledge my transgression so you are rejecting Satan and whatever he can do you know you are rejecting him and then brother Bram says if you don't confess Satan has got a legal right to stay there so you reject whatever is of Satan you confess it before Christ then you are rejecting him you're rejecting Satan and then there Satan has no right to keep there why because you have rejected these things praise the name of our Lord and that's what we need to see that in our lives whatever is not of God we reject it we throw it away praise the name of our Lord we see that we don't entertain evil we don't Rejoice Lord help me in this area and now when you come before the presence of God like when we see in the scriptures in Zaria 3 Joshua the high priest he came before the presence of God and then Satan was resisting him Josh 3 rather Zar 3:1 the Bible says and he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him now imagine Joshua the high priest and the high priest was the most righteous person in the whole world was the man who was meant to intercede for the sin of the world once in would go and take blood in the holies of holies he intered for himself and for his house and for all the children of Israel and then here Joshua has gone into the presence of God to intercede for the people but now the Bible says he was actually being resisted by Satan Satan was offending him Satan was kind of in him Satan was pulling him back and then the Bible says Satan was standing at his on his right hand and right hand is the right hand of authority in other words whatever josua was doing Satan had taken over it in other words to make him do things which are not right to make him not worship right to make him not talk right to make him not get time to read the word of God and that's how Satan also resists us standing on your right hand you find you want do this but you're doing something different you find your meant to go forward in this but Satan pulls you back that's what the devil was doing to Joshua and many times you also get caught up in that kind of condition that the w weakness of the flesh overwhelms you until you find you are you get yourself into something and then you come to know that what I've done is wrong that's Satan getting a hold of you making you to do something which is not right and then the Bible says the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuke you Satan even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem is not this a brand pred out of fire now Joshua was clothed with filthy [Music] garments and stood before the angel of the Lord praise the name of Lord he came before the presence of God so even us in all our weaknesses in all our failures when we come before the presence of God we allow him to wash us we allow God to wash us like we have come in his presence this morning we allow the word of God to wash us we allow the word of God voice of him that cry [Music] and the house was filled with smoke verse five then said I who is me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in with people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts praise the name of the Lord so when Isaiah got into the presence of God he recognized his weakness praise the name of our Lord we need to recognize our weaknesses where is your weak area and when Isaiah recognized his weakness he confessed it he acknowledged it Lord I'm a man of uncleanness how about you what is your weakness what is your failure acknowledge it before God Lord this is my wak Lord this is my fa no this is where I do a lot of things are not right whenever I'm tempted in this area I fall Lord I need you to give me the ability to help you overcome in this kind of that's what Isaiah was crying he said Lord I'm a man of uncleanness what is me I'm [Music] undone I'm unworthy and then he also re realized where I was getting those things from oh I D in the midst of unclean people he realized this condition and then he confessed it said Lord it's me I'm undone praise the name of our Lord and when he confessed then the Bible says one of the Sims came with the call of fire and touched his lips and told him your iniquity is taken away and your sin is p praise the name of Lord he acknowledged his weakness he recognized his weakness he confessed it before the Lord and then the Lord came and delivered him out of we also need to be delivered out of our weaknesses to be delivered out of our failure and say Lord this is my weakness Lord this is my failure come in this area and deliver me come and change me this kind of condition Isaiah was changed he was dressed and after they addressed Joshua after they had cleaned Isaiah there was some work to do praise the name of our Lord there was some work to do and then Isaiah had the voice of the Lord saying Whom Shall I sing praise the name of our Lord he had the confidence to say Lord send me now praise the name of our Lord and that should be the same thing that at the end of this service each of us all our sins washed away all our un rightousness taken away and when the Lord says whom I I going to S he say Lord I'm praise the name of the Lord that when you go to your place of work tomorrow you are there as a witness to tell people about the goodness of the Lord at your place where you stay you are there as a witness tesy of the mercies of God the same thing David was in David was also in that condition the guilt you know he says restore unto me the joy of your salvation praise the name of our Lord says take out all the blood guilt let us go back to Psalms 51 praise the name of our Lord we are right before the Lord walking upright praise the name of Psalms 51 it says restore unto me the joy of your salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted to you prise the name of our Lord when David was changed when David the sin was taken away say now I'm going to those transgressors and I'm going to teach them your way I'm going to tell Sinners how they need to change praise the name of our Lord so you go and become an ambassador of God and tell the people God doesn't want you to be in that condition you got your neighbors with say ruming is wrong talk good praise the name of our Lord turn to the Lord you are testifying to them praise the name of our Lord and that's what go and tell the people he says go praise the name of the Lord inaria 3 and then verse seven praise the name of our Lord the scripture says thus says the Lord of hosts if you will walk in my ways and if you will keep my charge then you shall also judge my house and shall also keep my courts and I'll will give thee places to walk among the that stand by praise the name of our Lord God sent him forth go and help others go and pray for for others bring others to Salvation bring others praise the name of our Lord we need to acknowledge our weakness and ask God for our points of weakness that the Lord can deliver us that the Lord can set us free praise the name of our Lord now I want us now to get into father us now to get into father praise praise the name of the Lord in Romans and then verse 14 he says for we know that the law is spiritual but I am caral sold under sin for that I do not but what I hate that I do I would not I consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me that's in my flesh dwell no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not I would not that I do now if [Music] praise the name of the Lord now they ask brother Bram equation on that from 1964 it is question 378 says Romans 7 verse4 to verse 18 we know that the law is spiritual but I am sold under sin for as long as you are in this life it will always bother you pull you back frustrate you you want to do this is saying know this like when Jesus told that's why we need to receive the new birth praise the name of the Lord in Ephesians chapter [Music] 1 and then verse 13 it says who also after you believe you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory so then we need to see that God fills us with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is the Hest of our inheritance in other words our soul has been redeemed now we are waiting for the Redemption of this body our soul has got eternal life but this body can die this body can become sick this body this body can attract sin Satan can attack our bodies but the Inside Man is converted so that's why we need the new birth on the ins side so that the man on the inside you know the Inner Man the converted man the converted man on the inside can bring the outer man under subjection to the word of regardless of our weaknesses praise the name of our Lord the outer man can still be subject to the word of God praise the name of our Lord that's why we need the Holy Spirit on the inside and when the Holy Spirit is on the inside then the Bible says in Romans 12 and then verse one praise the name of our says I beseech you Brethren you present your caral nature as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service but you can only do this in case the inside is converted but if the inside is not converted the can nature can never be subject at all praise the name of our Lord and so the more praise the name of our Lord you desire the things of God the more you desire the spirit of God is the more the Power of this flesh is put down praise the name of our Lord in Galatians chapter 5 praise praise the name of the Lord Galatians chter 5 and then we read in verse verse 16 it says this I said then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lasts against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you ought to do praise the name of the Lord it says the flesh we are in will always last against the spirit in the Inner Man even the spirit in the Inner Man will contrary to the flesh says each of them is contrary to the one another praise the name of our Lord so then you learn how to yield to the holy spirit that you bring the body under subjection praise the name of the Lord to see how you stay in the Pres of God to see how you can be in continuous Fellowship that the Lord can give you the that such as the heart knows what deliver me in this kind of deliver me in this kind of praise the name of our we need to recognize our weaknesses and when you recognize it you say Lord have my support Lord he said Lord have my support Lord deliver me in this kind of are deliver me in this kind of condition praise the name of our Lord and brother Bram says as long as we are living in this body this body because it's not yet converted the conversion of this body will be at the time when these moral bodies shall become immortal when the corruptible body shall become Incorruptible so at that time not be able to become sick it not be not be troubled not be worried praise the name of our Lord do not be worried praise the name of our but right now right now with the B of the Holy Ghost inside of you because we are still under bodies that can easily be influenced to do something wrong so you avoid things that are not try your body is not yet converted it can easily be taken in that sin it can easily be taken to do something wrong praise the name of our Lord so you don't give room to the body to pull you into something wrong but then you allow the Holy Spirit to govern all your life to take charge over your life you know you the Holy Spirit leads you to the other place gu you to the other place and then you allow the spirit to take charge over your life now it's still back to that most of your time giving most of your time to that character of Christ giving most of your time to that character of Christ you are yielding yourself to the spirit and brother Bram tells us that the Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God so you take time to read the word you take time to hear the word take time to obey the word you take time to talk about the word of God and that's how we can be in position to weaken the power of the caral nature that's we can be able to bring our body under subjection so that you are under subject the leadership of God and now when you yield to the spirit of God praise the name of the Lord when you take your time into the things of God then the character of God will be manifested in your life praise the name of our Lord where somebody you you are testifying about the goodness of it's a contrary thing the flesh wants you to rumor the spirit wants you to testify praise the name of our Lord the flesh wants you to hate but the spirit wants you to love so which side are you falling on the flesh wants you to be bitter the spirit wants you to be good praise the name of our Lord so when you go by the way of the Lord when your Delight is in the word of God you take most of your time in then the Bible says you shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water as and it says it brings its fruit in season praise the name of the Lord when is hatred that's the season of love praise the name of you don't make it you don't just manufacture it praise the name of like last the other sat on the wedding of Isaac and Rose one parent was saying you know when he calls you keep quiet that is psychology praise the but the true fruit of the spirit when somebody is crowing you'll meet it with sweetness praise the name of the Lord there's a can nature but there's also a spiritual nature praise the name of our Lord so then you'll find that your life is after the things of God praise the name of our Lord and this is that we can be able to overcome our weaknesses the things that trouble us let us yield to the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord when you recognize where your weakness is say Lord have mercy upon me in this area deliver me in this kind of area and then you allow God to take over your weakness praise the name of our Lord we need to recognize our weaknesses and then bring it before the Lord with prayers and supplication praise the name of our Lord let us go and look at another example as I try to finish praise the name of our Lord let us go to the Book of Luke Luke chapter 18 and then verse 9 Luke 18:9 the scripture says and he spoke this Parable unto them certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray and one a Pharisee and other Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus himself God I thank thee that I am not as the other men extortioners unjust adulterers even as this public I fast twice in the week I give titles of all that I possess now that was the Pharisees when he went to the presence of God he started exting himself I do this I do this I have strength to do this this one I don't do I'm not like the other man not like the other one I pay my ties I fast two times a week I'm not like even this other man praying here how do you approach God praise the name of our Lord so when you go to God don't tell God your strength like Nezar all the world is under me you tell God your weakness Lord this is where I'm failing Lord this is where I'm not doing right Lord this is where I'm not doing this and then the other man the publican the Bible says in verse 13 and the Publican standing a far off would not lift up so much his eyes unto heaven but SM upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner praise the name of our that's how we approach God Lord have mercy upon me Lord deliver me from my weakness Lord deliver me from my failures that's why the Lord wants us to hear recognizing your weaknesses Lord this is the area I'm not doing well this is the area I'm failing and then Jesus said I tell you this man went down to the house Justified [Music] rather than the other for everyone that exalts himself shall be Abed and that humbles himself shall be exalted praise the name of when we approach God In Prayer acknowledge your weaknesses Lord this is my area of need you know this is where I'm fa be like the Publican admit your weaknesses tell them before the Lord and then ask God for his Mercy Lord come down in my are of come down in my AGA of failure you know the Bible has told us if we hide our sin we shall not Prosper so then you see that you make it known before the Lord you know like in the Old Testament when people had leprosy the Bible says in Leviticus 13 and then verse 44 it says he is a leprous man he is unclean the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean his plague is in his head now he says because the priest checks the person and then after checking the based on the word of God he pronounces him unclean and when we come before the presence of God he examines us and then he says this point you are lacking this one you're doing is not right this thought you're doing is not right this word you're saying are not right that's what was happening and lepos stands for sin and then the Bible says in verse 45 and the leper whom the plague is his clothes shall be rent and his head shall bear his head bear and shall put on a covering upon the upper lip and and shall cry unan un what is he doing he's confessing he's confessing his condition he's confessing the condition of his I acknowledge my transgression praise the name of our Lord I ackowledge my sin I'm not hiding it but Lord I'm confessing it I have this leprosy unclean unlean unlean why do you confess unclean like Isaiah unlean lips when confessed un clean lips then he was clean praise the name of our Lord also when we confess before the Lord Lord this is my condition Lord this is my weakness spirit of God comes washes us makes us clean and restor us back praise the name of our Lord don't hide your weakness before God it confess it praise the name of our Lord and that's how the Lord will forgive you that's how the Lord will deliver you praise the name of our Lord you know there are some people who know how to hide praise the name of our Lord and they now to hide where you can't reach either in the bedroom and in the bedroom there is a pit hidden there then you beat about here beat about there you can't Prosper but then you said Lord you know there are some people who have tasas and they put it in the west of their trousers and they saw around it it is there some of them put them in their inner garet just there you can't get it however much you search it but he knows that is there and then some at their home you get there is a plant which does not dry and it's always protected green something is bur hidden there was a woman who was a Sunday school teacher in the days of brother Bram and then she had been taken to in institions but she would not be delivered at all and now she calls sister Mida if brother Bram is under the anointing you call me so one day brother Bram was under anointing they called her and then she came her problem she had been prayed for several times several years she's not delivered but now when brother BR was under the anointing he went and got where the problem was and then started Discerning her said you were in this car you were with this person no don't say don't say don't said but that's where the problem is you're with a man committing adulter when your husband was in was military away and then you were in the car the train was almost crashing you then he told you need to go and confess it said my marriage will not be there she was already mad you know she was now afraid but something hidden and brother Bram says the devil has a legal right St to stay there as long as you have unconfessed sin so even this woman however much she was prayed for she wouldn't be delivered because she had the good of Satan and brother identified it this is the area you need to make right and then when brother Bram was telling about the husband isn't your husband this and this doesn't your husband look like this or this he said yes he's the one he said a problem and then she said my husband is a Deon cannot do such a thing then he said you can't bring him here praise the name of our Lord so there are things people hide they need to make before God said Lord this is my weakness like the leper I'm unlean confession why am I I'm unclean Isaiah I'm unlean you are calling for deliverance you are calling for your cleansing praise the name of our Lord and Isaiah when he said I'm un clean then the the sarapin came and made him clean praise the name of our Lord and we are now in the presence of God to be made clean all of us praise the name of our Lord that we can be made whole whatever weakness that we have whatever failure that we have whatever condition we are in the Lord is here to deliver every one of us praise the name of our Lord to change you from that condition to restore you back to the joy of your salvation to change your nature to change your character to make you a new again praise the name of our Lord rest toward the Zeal of the Lord rest the first love of God where you used to love God but now you don't love him anymore why the weaknesses have taken over so you say Lord this is my weakness Lord this is my failure I don't care any about the things of God praise the name of the Lord like last Saturday when we had the wedding praise the name of our Lord most of us stayed around up to evening but the previous Sunday before that wedding we had the morning service we had here the the afternoon service and we had the Lord's supper and then somebody gives excuse I can't be around the the church the whole day the things of God you can't be around the kind of things you can be around some weakness praise the name of our Lord the whole day you at church because there is food there's conversation but the whole day you're not at church because you're going to pray because you're going to have the Lord praise the name of our Lord then we have the wedding the meetings of the married people and many of them don't want to attend then you start wondering where is the weakness we need to recognize our weaknesses and then come and say Lord this is my area but you see if you don't recognize your weakness you're not going to be help otherwise you are taking a Cancer and it keeps on growing eating you by the time you come for help it may be too much maybe the damage is Big maybe a number of your children have been destroyed they're no longer interested in the things of God because they see the parents they don't come for the afternoon service they are visiting their friends they in their businesses what will your children do do what example are you giving your children Lord this supper you have other programs but the things we have them once in a month but you cannot put time for those things of God it's a weakness praise the name of our Lord so you said Lord here I'm unclean Lord I need to be helped in this kind of area are coming to church any time we want to come time the preacher starts at 11 then you also start working out on that time it's a weakness and it's the devil just taking a hold of you slowly by slow until when the preacher starts preaching your mind is still troubled just up and down up and down by the time you settle the service is almost over and then you go back with the same weaknesses you even more dangerous condition yeah because the devil also comes to church either you've received from God or from the devil so you go weaker than you can instead of stronger than you can because you didn't have respect for the things so we need to see that we recognize our weaknesses and then the Bible says when we confess we forsake praise the name of the Lord if my weakness has been going to the B I said Lord forgive me for going to the B then I stop going to the B praise the name of our Lord whatever your weakness is praise the name of our Lord you confess it and you forsake it that's how you are delivered praise the name of our Lord and one way the Lord works when God talks about your weakness it means he's there to deliver you praise the name of our Lord and I believe the Lord is here to deliver every one of us all our it doesn't matter what kind of weakness it doesn't matter what kind of failure the Lord is here to Deliver Us Praise the name of our Lord may God bless you amen we have an afternoon service for the Youth praise the name of the Lord I want us to sing this
