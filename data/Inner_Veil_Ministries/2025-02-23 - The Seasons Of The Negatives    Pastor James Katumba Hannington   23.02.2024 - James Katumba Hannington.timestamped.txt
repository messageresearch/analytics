[35:22] name of
[35:24] God that is only the god of the mountain
[35:28] and is not the god of the
[35:30] valley then God said no I have to show
[35:33] them that I'm the god of the
[35:36] valley praise the name of then the Bible
[35:39] says the syrians covered the whole
[35:43] place but Israel were just like small
[35:46] groups of
[35:49] gods but God came and they defeated the
[35:54] Syrian because it's the same God praise

[36:25] stand up to us to stand up and go to our
[36:29] Bibles we are going to read in the Book
[36:31] of Ecclesiastes chapter
[36:35] 3 from verse 1 to verse
[36:39] 8 praise the name of our Lord pray
[36:44] before we read us
[36:46] pray father we thank you for this

[37:00] us through Thy
[37:02] word to help us in the time of need that
[37:05] we are going
[37:07] through that bless us all together in
[37:10] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ us
[37:13] this amen so eclesiastes 8 verse 3 verse
[37:19] 1
[37:23] to the Bible
[37:26] says to everything there is a season and
[37:30] a time to every purpose under the
[37:42] heaven to be born and a time to die it's
[37:46] time to plant and a time to pluck up
[37:48] that which is planted
[37:59] A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time
[38:02] to break down and a time to build
[38:15] up a time to weep and a time to laugh a
[38:19] time to
[38:20] mour and a time to dance
[38:37] a time to Cast Away stones and a time to
[38:39] gather Stones together a time to embrace
[38:42] and a Time refrain from
[38:55] embracing a time to get and a time to
[38:58] lose a time to keep and a time to Cast
[39:17] Away a time to rent and a time to s a
[39:21] time to keep silence and a time to speak
[39:35] a time to love and a time to hate a time
[39:38] of and a time of
[39:46] [Music]
[39:50] Peace amen
[39:54] word so I want to preach on the subject
[39:59] the seasons of the
[40:04] negatives praise the name of the Lord
[40:08] seasons and then there are
[40:12] negatives or things that are not
[40:17] pleasant praise the name of Lord they
[40:19] are not
[40:20] pleasant but they love to
[40:23] come that's what the Bible is telling
[40:26] us scripture is telling
[40:29] us that there is a time or a
[40:34] season for
[40:38] everything a time to every
[40:41] purpose under the
[40:44] Heaven There is a time when we are
[40:47] born and then there is a time when we
[40:50] die a time when we are
[40:53] born what a joy what a gladness
[40:58] that you have been born but yet there is
[41:00] a time when the Natural Life comes to
[41:05] un and then it's a time of
[41:08] Sorrow a time of
[41:10] regret it's a season of
[41:15] negative then he says a time to
[41:19] plant and a time to plant up that which
[41:22] is
[41:24] planted It's Time to Kill
[41:27] and a time to
[41:29] he a time to break
[41:31] down and a time to build
[41:34] up a time to
[41:36] weep and a time to
[41:39] laugh a time to
[41:41] mour and a time to dance so then there
[41:45] are STS that keep on coming in
[41:48] life and those STS that
[41:51] come that we Face make us to react in a
[41:55] certain way
[41:59] the of like when a child is born in a
[42:02] family it will bring joy and when a
[42:06] person dies in a
[42:07] family it brings
[42:11] sorrowfulness
[42:12] depression
[42:15] uncertainties when a person achieves in
[42:18] a
[42:19] family everybody
[42:21] rejoices everybody wants to talk about
[42:24] that but then when somebody
[42:28] loses some
[42:30] Fails Like recent' been having the
[42:33] examinations of and for
[42:41] coming a child
[42:43] passes it is such a joy praise the name
[42:47] of our Lord at the school and even the
[42:51] family but now if a child doesn't do
[42:54] well it's not pleasant
[42:58] so now the scripture is telling us there
[43:01] is a
[43:02] season to
[43:04] everything and there is a time for every
[43:09] purpose praise the name of our and then
[43:12] we see that God has created them like
[43:17] that praise the name of our Lord but
[43:20] then we see much as we can have the
[43:23] positive you know the things that are
[43:25] Pleasant
[43:27] the things that make us so
[43:30] glad the things that you know we esteem
[43:34] highly the things that you tget to
[43:38] achieve like a
[43:40] businessman you know a
[43:42] businessman is looking at how we can get
[43:46] profit but then in that same
[43:49] business they also
[43:52] risks you know the things you're not
[43:55] sure about
[43:57] s can come and break down your
[44:01] shop if you're maybe a farmer you know
[44:05] something can
[44:07] happen maybe the weather becomes so
[44:11] terrible and then you make a loss or
[44:14] even F can
[44:16] come or maybe the market goes
[44:19] down and then you said this season have
[44:21] made a
[44:23] loss but it doesn't mean that you
[44:26] because made the loss in this
[44:29] season the next you can't make a
[44:32] profit you know so because it is a
[44:36] cyc you know something that
[44:40] repeats praise the name of the Lord you
[44:42] know it's just like something
[44:45] cirular when it is
[44:47] rolling one point it is
[44:50] up at one point it is up and then that
[44:54] thing can also come down and then it
[44:57] keeps on moving
[44:59] like as we were Tau last
[45:02] Sunday you know the shadows in the
[45:06] cycle praise the name of our Lord so
[45:08] something
[45:10] negative is
[45:12] unpleasant it is
[45:16] depressing sometimes can be
[45:19] harmful it can be
[45:22] terrible it can be
[45:25] tough it can be
[45:29] it can be
[45:31] sorrowful it can be bad it can be
[45:36] rejected it
[45:42] be it can be
[45:46] destructive
[45:48] unfavorable you know
[45:54] undes God permits those to come in our
[45:59] way praise the name of the Lord now in
[46:02] the Book of Genesis
[46:05] 8 and then verse
[46:07] 22 the Bible says while the Earth
[46:13] remain Genesis
[46:17] 8:22 while the Earth
[46:20] remainers seed time and
[46:24] harvest and cold and Heat
[46:28] and summer and
[46:31] winter and day and
[46:34] night shall not
[46:36] CE now you look at these things he says
[46:40] there is a SE
[46:43] time time to to S the
[46:47] sea and then the scripture
[46:50] says they go when they are
[46:54] sewing let us speak that scripture here
[46:57] praise the name of our Lord let me get
[47:00] it
[47:01] here during the time when you are
[47:05] sewing the Bible
[47:07] says let us go to the scripture
[47:15] here it's in the book
[47:18] of Psalms 126
[47:27] Psalms 126 and then verse verse
[47:32] 5 shall reap in
[47:35] Joy he that go forth and
[47:43] weepth bearing precious
[47:48] seed shall doubtlessly come again with
[47:52] rejoicing bringing his f with him
[47:59] so he says the seed
[48:01] time is a weeping
[48:05] time is kind of like un Pleasant
[48:10] time but then if you are going to do the
[48:14] Harvest you need to go into this
[48:17] sewing but then he saying
[48:20] sewing you are bearing precious
[48:25] seed now it's as if you are losing your
[48:29] seat you know like taking your children
[48:31] to
[48:32] school and then they start
[48:35] crying you know and then you feel that
[48:37] that kind of you know
[48:39] burden I don't want my children to be
[48:42] aware from
[48:43] me but the more you keep them your
[48:46] children around
[48:50] Yourself Praise the name of because they
[48:53] not going to live in your house all the
[48:54] time to prepare them for the times
[48:58] ahe and so it's the same thing in
[49:02] sewing you are preparing yourself for
[49:05] the Times
[49:07] ahead where there will be
[49:10] necessity so he says that se
[49:13] time and harest
[49:16] time shall not Cee and then he says cold
[49:22] and heat shall not
[49:25] CE so when
[49:27] and then you know the
[49:29] wetness the coldness now look at what we
[49:33] are going
[49:35] through but this is not the end it will
[49:39] also get over and the other one comes
[49:42] another cycle
[49:44] coming then he says summer and
[49:50] winter here we don't know what winter
[49:53] is praise the name of our Lord we've
[49:56] never seen snow
[49:58] around or our temper going below
[50:04] zero but those people who go through
[50:06] that can know what exactly
[50:09] is and then he says day and
[50:14] night shall not see just as we have the
[50:17] day
[50:18] now know that the night is
[50:21] coming praise the name of our Lord you
[50:24] know during day you don't need the
[50:28] during day praise the name of our Lord
[50:31] you don't need to be so why because you
[50:34] are seeing the
[50:36] light you are seeing the light you are
[50:39] seeing where you going but it's a time
[50:44] of being
[50:47] careful in the Book of John chapter
[50:51] 11 and then
[50:53] verse the Bible says
[50:56] Jesus answered are there not 12 hours in
[51:00] the day if a man walk in the day he
[51:03] shall not he stumbles not because he
[51:06] sees the light of the world he stumbles
[51:09] because there is no light in him
[51:28] praise the name of the Lord it says when
[51:30] you walk during that
[51:33] time this hide behind you know banana
[51:40] plants know if you move at
[51:43] night you know in a place where there is
[51:46] a lot of banana plantation and
[51:51] coffee and then the night dancers
[51:57] do you know that there are mod night
[52:03] dancers in town they also night
[52:05] dancers but for them they have built for
[52:08] them a big hole where they
[52:11] danc same
[52:13] spirits that make them not go to
[52:16] sleep those in the village who live
[52:19] running
[52:22] naked going
[52:24] hold Same Spirit
[52:27] so when you walk in the day
[52:32] 2 the scripture talks about four Gentile
[52:40] kingdoms it started with the bonian
[52:44] Empire which was the head of
[52:47] God praise the name of Lord then from
[52:50] the Babylonian
[52:54] Empire then it went to the
[52:56] to thean and you know
[53:05] Kingdom and you know that was now the
[53:08] the hands the shoulder
[53:13] silver and then from thean and median
[53:21] Kingdom it went now to the Greek Kingdom
[53:26] and now the Greek kingdom was know the
[53:28] stomach and the
[53:33] thighs you know of
[53:36] brass and then now it goes to the feet
[53:40] and the toes of iron and
[53:47] clay and that is the Roman
[53:51] Empire and I can say according to the
[53:55] scriptures are still living under the
[53:58] Roman
[54:00] Empire according to the scriptures and
[54:04] it is that the time of the Roman
[54:07] Empire that Christ came the first
[54:10] time and still at the time of the Roman
[54:14] Empire that Christ comes the second
[54:17] time to pick his bride and now when
[54:21] Christ comes the third
[54:23] time he comes to destroy the Roman
[54:26] Empire
[54:28] so we are under the Roman
[54:29] Empire and now the Roman Empire is a
[54:33] religious
[54:35] system right now in the days of Christ
[54:39] it was the
[54:41] Emperors but in the religious
[54:44] time it the pop praise the name of our
[54:48] so now we see
[54:50] here that you know God our Lord Jesus
[54:54] Christ was telling
[54:57] disciples when they were telling him
[55:00] when you restore the kingdom to
[55:03] Israel in other words to the divinely
[55:06] given king of
[55:09] God you know the king to Ru over them
[55:14] who is not under any
[55:17] leadership not under the leadership of
[55:19] the
[55:21] emperor not under the leadership of the
[55:24] pops but under the leaders ship of God
[55:28] himself they were asking when is the
[55:31] time of
[55:33] restoration Jesus Christ told them it is
[55:36] not for you to know the times or the
[55:43] seasons God has the power to determine
[55:46] the B praise the name of the Lord so now
[55:50] when we are going through our seasons of
[55:54] negatives you know things that are not
[55:58] pleasant all the power is in the hands
[56:02] of praise the name of our Lord then
[56:05] verse 8 it tells but you shall receive
[56:08] power after the Holy Ghost is come upon
[56:13] you and shall be Witnesses unto
[56:17] me in
[56:19] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[56:23] Samaria unto the utmost part of the
[56:25] Earth
[56:27] so instead of them being afraid of the
[56:30] times and the
[56:32] seasons Christ was now pointing
[56:36] them that what you need in the
[56:41] season which you are going through is
[56:44] you need the holy spirit that will give
[56:47] you the power to go through
[56:50] dist praise the name of our Lord and
[56:53] that's the same thing that we need also
[56:56] we need the power of God to help us go
[57:01] through times of
[57:03] uncertainity we need the presence of
[57:07] God Seven compound Redemptive
[57:12] names Jehovah was
[57:18] onef
[57:21] Jehovah man
[57:23] Shi man and then now so he says seven
[57:28] Redemptive
[57:31] names that the Lord would appear to the
[57:36] people according to the need that they
[57:41] hadise the name of when Abraham was on
[57:44] the
[57:45] mountain and then God told him sacrifice
[57:48] Isaac your
[57:51] son and then when God saw Abraham going
[57:54] to cat Isaac
[57:57] told him don't do
[57:59] that what did the Lord do he provided
[58:04] lamb for the sacrifice because God
[58:07] needed the
[58:08] sacrifice what did he do he provided
[58:12] it praise the name of the Lord so God is
[58:18] Jehovah is God the
[58:21] provider so when you have
[58:25] necessities is Jehovah G and you call
[58:28] him upon his
[58:30] name no this is my
[58:33] need does he he
[58:36] provides when you are at
[58:40] unrest God
[58:45] Shalom when you don't know where to
[58:49] go God is
[58:53] Jehovah you know the shepher
[58:56] praise the name of the Lord is your
[59:00] Shepherd the Bible says the Lord is my
[59:04] shepher so I depend upon his
[59:08] leadership praise the name of when I'm
[59:12] sick God is Jehovah
[59:16] Rafa the Healer he heal all my
[59:21] diseases when I'm in
[59:23] sin God
[59:29] God our
[59:31] righteousness prise the name of our Lord
[59:34] so he gives me the
[59:36] righteousness praise the name of our
[59:38] Lord when I'm under
[59:42] battles
[59:45] God the Lord
[59:50] our our Victory the god of
[59:54] hosts God Mighty in
[59:57] battle what are you going
[1:00:00] through God is mighty in the battle so
[1:00:03] you just call him in that
[1:00:06] situation come over my condition Lord
[1:00:09] overcome over what
[1:00:12] ising
[1:00:13] Jehovah praise the name of when you feel
[1:00:17] that you are
[1:00:18] alone
[1:00:23] forsaken god Jehovah
[1:00:27] the Lord is
[1:00:29] present praise the name of our Lord
[1:00:33] now let us go back
[1:00:35] again in the book of Philippians
[1:00:43] 3: Philippians 3
[1:00:49] ver the Bible says for our conversation
[1:00:53] is in heaven from when also
[1:00:56] we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus
[1:01:05] Christ the Bible says our
[1:01:10] citizenship is in
[1:01:12] heaven so we are on this
[1:01:16] land it's a journey that we are
[1:01:19] taking and when you are on a
[1:01:22] journey the scener keeps on changing
[1:01:27] it keeps on
[1:01:28] changing sometimes you're on the
[1:01:30] mountain sometimes you're in the
[1:01:33] valley sometimes you're in the
[1:01:35] forest sometimes you're in the
[1:01:38] town sometimes you in a swamp
[1:01:40] area sometimes you're in a rock
[1:01:43] place it's a
[1:01:45] pilgrimage but God determines the times
[1:01:48] of each of those
[1:01:51] things when you're going to go through
[1:01:53] this when you're going to go through
[1:01:55] this when you're going to go through
[1:01:57] this when you're going to go through and
[1:01:59] now as we go through those
[1:02:02] things the Bible says we live in V
[1:02:08] bodies in verse 21 who shall change our
[1:02:12] v
[1:02:16] body that it may be fion like unto his
[1:02:20] glorious
[1:02:22] body according to the working whereby
[1:02:26] he's able to subdue all things unto
[1:02:34] himself the Bible says we live in Vile
[1:02:40] bodies there bodies of
[1:02:44] humiliation are bodies that
[1:02:48] areow bodies of
[1:02:51] failure they are bodies of
[1:02:53] weakness the bodies that we living now
[1:02:57] you add the condition of the
[1:03:00] body and then you add on the condition
[1:03:03] of the environment we are
[1:03:07] living and then you see that the
[1:03:09] negative
[1:03:12] season they can be a div Upon
[1:03:17] Us Praise the name of our they can be so
[1:03:22] frightening they can be so kind of like
[1:03:24] distressful
[1:03:27] like John the
[1:03:29] Baptist John the Baptist he got the
[1:03:32] baptism of the Holy
[1:03:34] Spirit when he was in his mother's
[1:03:36] wom and he had such a powerful
[1:03:40] Ministry that this man was preaching in
[1:03:42] the
[1:03:44] desert on the rivers he was not
[1:03:47] preaching in the
[1:03:48] town people would walk from the town and
[1:03:52] they would go to the rivers or in the
[1:03:54] desert John
[1:03:56] preach praise the name of our so highly
[1:04:01] anointed praise the name of our but the
[1:04:04] time
[1:04:05] came that the season of his
[1:04:09] ministry had come to an end so what
[1:04:12] happened he was
[1:04:14] arrested he put in
[1:04:16] prison unpleasant
[1:04:19] Place unpleasant
[1:04:22] season and when he was in the prison and
[1:04:25] he had the disciples tell him about
[1:04:27] Jesus
[1:04:29] Christ what did John tell them go and
[1:04:33] ask him if he the
[1:04:36] one but he the one who introduced
[1:04:39] Christ praise the name of the Lord let
[1:04:42] us go in the scripture
[1:04:46] here in the Book of John John chapter
[1:04:51] 1 and then verse 29
[1:04:56] the next day John sees Jesus coming unto
[1:04:58] him and says Behold the Lamb of God
[1:05:02] which takes away the sin of
[1:05:13] the this is he of whom I said after me
[1:05:17] cometh a man which is preferred before
[1:05:20] me for he was before me
[1:05:31] and I knew him
[1:05:33] not but that he should be made manifest
[1:05:37] to
[1:05:39] Israel therefore I'm
[1:05:42] come baptizing with
[1:05:46] water now you see this he's recognizing
[1:05:49] his
[1:05:51] ministry that why I was
[1:05:53] sent to introduce Jes
[1:05:57] but now the ministry is over is now
[1:06:00] doubting whether that was
[1:06:03] Christ praise the name of the Lord then
[1:06:05] he says and I knew him
[1:06:09] not verse 32 and John be record saying I
[1:06:15] saw the Spirit descending from heaven
[1:06:17] like a
[1:06:20] d and it AB upon
[1:06:24] him and knew him
[1:06:27] not but he that sent me to baptize with
[1:06:32] water the same said unto
[1:06:36] me upon whom thou sh see the spirit
[1:06:43] descending and remaining on
[1:06:45] him the same is which bapes with the
[1:06:49] Holy
[1:06:50] Ghost and I bear record that this is the
[1:06:54] son of
[1:06:58] and next day after
[1:07:02] stood two of the
[1:07:06] disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he
[1:07:10] walked he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:07:15] God praise the name of you look at the
[1:07:18] of
[1:07:19] John filled with the Holy
[1:07:21] Spirit called to be a
[1:07:24] prophet born the
[1:07:26] promise praise the name of the Lord but
[1:07:29] now when the conditions
[1:07:32] change he started
[1:07:34] wondering are you the
[1:07:38] Christ praise the name of he started
[1:07:41] wondering what is
[1:07:44] this now if John would get into such a
[1:07:49] situation how about you and me praise
[1:07:53] the name of the Lord if John
[1:07:56] would do such a
[1:07:57] thing in the message forgotten
[1:08:05] beatitude the he says so we find out
[1:08:09] here that the devil tries to make the
[1:08:11] people
[1:08:16] believes
[1:08:18] disel so the devil is trying to get
[1:08:22] John to disbel
[1:08:25] he was the
[1:08:27] Messiah so he got two of his
[1:08:31] disciples and sent them out and say you
[1:08:34] go out and find
[1:08:37] we he he's the one
[1:08:40] preaching and when you do go out and ask
[1:08:44] him have I been
[1:08:47] wrong could you imagine
[1:08:52] that I could have been wrong
[1:08:56] is it really the same
[1:08:57] one I know the sign was right I seen the
[1:09:01] mesiah sign I know what was right but
[1:09:06] this me and
[1:09:10] lowly I don't get it I can't figure it
[1:09:14] up I can't make end me with
[1:09:17] it and then brother Bram says you're not
[1:09:20] supposed to make ends
[1:09:23] meat praise the name of
[1:09:26] so he was
[1:09:27] wondering is he the one or we look for
[1:09:31] another seasons of
[1:09:34] negatives now in Luke chap
[1:09:38] 7 and then verse 19 and John calling
[1:09:42] unto him to his disciples sent them to
[1:09:44] Jesus saying at though he that should
[1:09:48] come or we look for
[1:09:52] another Luke 7:19 l
[1:10:16] when the men came unto him saying they
[1:10:19] said John the Baptist has sent us unto
[1:10:21] the same that though he that should come
[1:10:24] or will look for
[1:10:38] another praise the name of the Lord
[1:10:41] Jesus just told them stay for the
[1:10:45] meeting and then they show the
[1:10:47] manifestation of the spirit of
[1:10:51] God the sick being heal the lame walking
[1:10:56] blind and then he sent them away go and
[1:11:00] tell joh what you have
[1:11:01] seen and so when we are in the seasons
[1:11:04] of
[1:11:06] negatives praise the name of our Lord
[1:11:08] that's the time you need to think about
[1:11:10] the goodness
[1:11:13] of What the Lord Has Done
[1:11:16] For praise the name of our Lord It's the
[1:11:19] time to start
[1:11:21] testifying about the goodness of God how
[1:11:24] the Lord has brought me this how the
[1:11:27] Lord has saved my soul how the Lord has
[1:11:30] delivered him from so many
[1:11:32] things and you don't allow
[1:11:35] Satan to make you focus on the
[1:11:40] negatives you are living in the night
[1:11:44] don't be
[1:11:45] scared praise the name of the Lord no
[1:11:48] sure the night will come
[1:11:51] to that's what the scripture says you
[1:11:54] know I always
[1:11:55] wondered let us go to Psalms
[1:11:59] 112 and then verse
[1:12:03] four the Bible says unto the
[1:12:07] upright there arises light in the
[1:12:16] darkness so the
[1:12:19] upright living in the
[1:12:22] darkness it may be a darkness of your
[1:12:27] it may be a of
[1:12:31] uncertainity
[1:12:33] something you know living in the
[1:12:37] darkness you know it's just like at
[1:12:40] home if you want to sit in a
[1:12:43] place you look for FL

[1:18:10] do they would say let me get a witch
[1:18:14] doctor and then they try to put charms
[1:18:16] around their homes

[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:18] coming pressing against you giving you
[1:19:22] wrong
[1:19:23] suggestions doing this doing this now in
[1:19:28] 2 Corinthians
[1:19:35] 6:4 it says but in all things approving
[1:19:39] ourselves as Ministers of God in much
[1:19:42] patience in afflictions in Necessities
[1:19:45] in distresses
[1:20:00] in stripes in imprisonments in tlets in
[1:20:04] labors in watchings in
[1:20:18] fastings praise the name of the Lord it
[1:20:20] says we go through all these unpleasant
[1:20:23] things
[1:20:26] but God gives us
[1:20:28] Grace when we in those kind of
[1:20:31] Seasons praise the name of our Lord he
[1:20:33] comes down and gives us
[1:20:36] strength he comes and encourages
[1:20:39] Us Praise the name of our Lord the Lord
[1:20:42] says I'm a very present
[1:20:46] help in trouble in Psalms 46
[1:20:52] verse1 he says
[1:20:55] God is our refuge and strength a very
[1:21:00] present help in
[1:21:04] trouble Psalms 46
[1:21:14] verse1 verse one to verse three
[1:21:28] he says God is our
[1:21:33] refuge
[1:21:35] is very present in other words all the
[1:21:39] time is our
[1:21:41] refuge all the time God is our
[1:21:44] strength and he says is a very present
[1:21:49] help very present in trouble so when
[1:21:53] Trouble Comes like that know that the
[1:21:56] Lord is already there so what do you do
[1:21:59] you call upon the name of the
[1:22:02] Lord and the Bible says whoever shall
[1:22:05] call upon the name of the
[1:22:07] Lord shall be saved that's the time
[1:22:12] praise the name of our Lord to use that
[1:22:15] that's the time to put that in
[1:22:18] action if I'm sick then the Lord Health
[1:22:23] me if I'm afraid that the Lord is my
[1:22:27] peace praise the name of our Lord if I'm
[1:22:30] lacking the Lord is my provider so you
[1:22:34] call upon the name of the Lord based on
[1:22:37] the sttion that you are going through so
[1:22:40] he says I'm a very present
[1:22:43] help in trouble what kind of trouble are
[1:22:47] you going through what kind of season
[1:22:50] are you
[1:22:51] in a season of death
[1:22:54] a season of
[1:22:56] sickness a season of
[1:22:59] fear a season I don't have anything to
[1:23:03] do a season the Bible says is a very
[1:23:08] present
[1:23:09] help in trouble so you call upon the
[1:23:13] Lord to come in that
[1:23:16] situation and don't allow in the
[1:23:19] condition you are going
[1:23:20] through to become like the children of
[1:23:23] Israel
[1:23:25] you know the children of Israel in the
[1:23:29] wilderness they were all the time
[1:23:31] complaining all this all this all this
[1:23:36] don't allow that in your life look at
[1:23:38] the good that the Lord has
[1:23:40] done thank God for what he has done
[1:23:43] praise the name of don't look at the
[1:23:46] negative don't look at the things which
[1:23:48] are
[1:23:49] lacking don't look at the things which
[1:23:51] are disturbing you but rather glorify
[1:23:54] God for what he has done and say Lord I
[1:23:57] Thank you for this Lord I give praise to
[1:24:00] you have done
[1:24:01] this praise the name of our Lord you
[1:24:04] know the children of Israel the pillar
[1:24:06] of fire was before
[1:24:08] them the glory of God was before them
[1:24:11] but they only looked at the things they
[1:24:13] didn't
[1:24:15] have but the presence of God was always
[1:24:18] with
[1:24:20] them you can imagine the cloud
[1:24:24] and that cloud was covering their
[1:24:27] head whenever they were going it was
[1:24:30] protecting them from the
[1:24:32] Sun so you can't say the heat was
[1:24:35] getting
[1:24:36] today he provided enough environmental
[1:24:39] condition for
[1:24:42] them when it comes
[1:24:44] tonight the
[1:24:46] cloud became a pillar of
[1:24:48] fire to give them the light and the heat
[1:24:53] when it is day
[1:24:55] it's a cloud the Bible says they never
[1:24:59] had they never had clothes get worn
[1:25:03] out their shoes they never got worn out
[1:25:08] their feet they never got
[1:25:11] swollen the Lord would provide whatever
[1:25:13] they
[1:25:14] needed when they needed the water rocks
[1:25:18] would provide the water every day food
[1:25:20] would
[1:25:22] fall but then they were complaining
[1:25:24] complain complaining
[1:25:27] complaining and then for you also start
[1:25:30] complaining are you b or
[1:25:35] what praise the name of our Lord have
[1:25:38] they taken you to prison for the date or
[1:25:43] what praise the name of the Lord but God
[1:25:46] has given
[1:25:47] Grace that even those who demand you
[1:25:51] they are patient with you that's the
[1:25:54] goodness of the
[1:25:55] Lord praise the name of the Lord that
[1:25:58] they can be patient with you when you
[1:26:00] tell them this is
[1:26:02] my oh my children at
[1:26:05] school God just holds them from chasing
[1:26:08] them
[1:26:10] away that's the goodness of God and so
[1:26:13] you should always be thankful to God I
[1:26:16] thank you for this I thank you for this
[1:26:20] or maybe it may be house rent
[1:26:24] for two months or three months God makes
[1:26:27] your landlord be patient with
[1:26:30] you that's the goodness of the Lord so
[1:26:34] you don't have cause to
[1:26:36] complain oh now this this no see the
[1:26:42] goodness of the Lord in every St that
[1:26:45] you go through and learn how to
[1:26:49] glorify know it is's wife who told him
[1:26:54] God and
[1:26:55] die and then told her should we only
[1:26:59] receive good things from
[1:27:01] God and not from not evil
[1:27:05] things praise the name of Lord we just
[1:27:08] need to learn how to be thankful unto
[1:27:10] the
[1:27:12] Lord and as we are living in these
[1:27:14] bodies which are
[1:27:18] V sometimes things which are not
[1:27:21] pleasant will always come
[1:27:25] praise the name of our Lord let us go
[1:27:27] back let us go to the book of chapter
[1:27:33] 1 and then verse
[1:27:35] four the Bible says one generation
[1:27:39] passes away and another generation
[1:27:43] cometh ecclesiast chter 1 verse 4
[1:27:59] but the Earth abideth
[1:28:03] forever The Sun Also
[1:28:06] arises and the sun goes
[1:28:09] down and to his place where he
[1:28:17] arose the wind goes toward the South
[1:28:24] and turn about unto the
[1:28:29] north it about
[1:28:34] continually and the wind return again
[1:28:36] according to his
[1:28:42] statut all the rivers run into the
[1:28:47] sea yet the sea is not
[1:28:51] full unto the place from where the
[1:28:54] rivers come
[1:28:57] from they return
[1:29:01] again all things are full of
[1:29:06] Labor man cannot
[1:29:09] it the eye is not satisfied with
[1:29:14] seeing nor are the ear filled with
[1:29:19] hearing the thing that has been
[1:29:24] it is that which shall
[1:29:26] be and that which is
[1:29:30] done is that which shall be
[1:29:32] done and there is no new thing under the
[1:29:39] sun is there anything whereof may be
[1:29:43] said see this is
[1:29:48] new it has been already of all time
[1:29:54] which was before
[1:29:56] us there is no remembrance of former
[1:30:01] things neither shall there be any
[1:30:05] remembrance of the things that to
[1:30:09] come with those who shall come
[1:30:13] after praise the name of Lord very
[1:30:17] interesting he says even what you are
[1:30:19] striving
[1:30:20] for others also do the same
[1:30:24] praise the name of but then for you you
[1:30:26] feel now if I achieve this I'll be the
[1:30:29] greatest man on
[1:30:32] Earth there are others who did
[1:30:35] that praise the name of oh I'm too
[1:30:39] strong I can run a
[1:30:41] race said
[1:30:43] finally you you'll be
[1:30:47] weak you get it so it has been it is
[1:30:51] here it will be and it keeps on
[1:30:55] repeating itself keeps on repeating
[1:30:58] itself it says there's nothing new Under
[1:31:01] the
[1:31:03] Sun the seasons we go through the times
[1:31:07] we are going
[1:31:08] through times of
[1:31:10] negatives times of
[1:31:12] positives challenging moments they have
[1:31:16] been there but how do you go through
[1:31:20] challenges praise the name of our Lord
[1:31:22] how do you go through them
[1:31:24] now in the message Dr
[1:31:27] Moses he says all scripture has a
[1:31:29] compound
[1:31:33] meaning it runs in
[1:31:37] cycles for
[1:31:39] instance there where it said in St
[1:31:44] Matthew out of Egypt I have called my
[1:31:49] son now that scripture that MTH was
[1:31:53] referring
[1:31:56] to was pertaining to
[1:32:00] Israel that was Jacob and God said out
[1:32:04] of Egypt I called my son
[1:32:10] Israel you know when they went to
[1:32:13] Egypt in captivity then he called them
[1:32:17] out but yet the same
[1:32:20] scripture refers also to Jesus Christ
[1:32:23] when was taken in Egypt then he says
[1:32:26] I've called my son
[1:32:28] out then he says the cycle of
[1:32:35] time SS
[1:32:38] back ever so
[1:32:41] often history repeats
[1:32:45] itself and scripture repeats itself down
[1:32:48] through the
[1:32:51] age and Scholars know that
[1:32:54] that's ever studed it from the spiritual
[1:32:58] standpoint to watch how the scripture
[1:33:00] will repeat
[1:33:02] itself run in Cycles like
[1:33:06] that it certainly
[1:33:08] does so that's why the Bible says what
[1:33:11] has been will be and then it keeps on
[1:33:14] coming on like
[1:33:16] that praise the name of our Lord and
[1:33:19] then brother Bram praise the name of our
[1:33:22] Lord in the message question and
[1:33:26] answers okay before we go to that let us
[1:33:29] go to the Ephesian
[1:33:31] church he says that cycle of Revival and
[1:33:35] death has never
[1:33:39] failed all you have to do is to recall
[1:33:44] this the last move of God in the
[1:33:50] spirit when men and women dressed like
[1:33:53] Christians
[1:33:56] went to
[1:33:57] churches prayed all night took the
[1:34:01] street corners and were not
[1:34:04] ashamed of the manifestation of the
[1:34:07] spirit they left their old dead
[1:34:11] churches and woried in homes of old
[1:34:14] store
[1:34:16] building they had
[1:34:19] reality but it wasn't too long time
[1:34:22] until they be began to get enough
[1:34:26] money to build fine new
[1:34:29] churches they put a choir instead of
[1:34:32] singing unto
[1:34:44] God then he
[1:34:46] says they they they put gowns on the
[1:34:51] choir they organize the movement and R
[1:34:54] it by
[1:34:57] man they soon began to read books that
[1:34:59] were not fit to
[1:35:02] read they let down the
[1:35:05] bars and the gods entered
[1:35:09] in and took over the Cry Of Joy was
[1:35:14] gone the freedom of the spirit was
[1:35:17] gone or they kept on with the
[1:35:21] form but the fire had died
[1:35:25] down and the Blackness of
[1:35:28] Ashes is all about what is
[1:35:32] left now that's the thing about the
[1:35:35] spiritual
[1:35:37] part the natural and
[1:35:39] spiritual you know they
[1:35:42] type now when you go again in the
[1:35:45] scriptures in the Book of
[1:35:48] Judges chapter 2 verse
[1:35:51] 18 the Bible says
[1:35:54] and when the Lord raised up
[1:35:57] judges Judges chapter 2
[1:36:06] verse and when the Lord raised up
[1:36:12] judges then the Lord was with the
[1:36:17] judge and delivered them out of the hand
[1:36:20] of their
[1:36:22] enemies all the days of the
[1:36:25] judge for it repented the Lord because
[1:36:28] of their groanings by reason of them
[1:36:30] that oppressed them and vexed
[1:36:41] them and it came to pass when the judge
[1:36:44] was dead that they returned and
[1:36:45] corrupted themselves more than their
[1:36:48] fathers following other gods to serve
[1:36:50] them and to B down unto them they ceased
[1:36:53] not from their own doings nor from their
[1:36:55] stubborn way
[1:37:33] praise the name of the Lord so it says
[1:37:35] when the judges would
[1:37:37] come then they overcome when the judg is
[1:37:40] dead they go back to evil things again
[1:37:43] God brings another judge they overcome
[1:37:47] it was a
[1:37:48] cycle even in the church ages when the
[1:37:51] messenger goes the fire of God calls
[1:37:55] down and again God raises another
[1:37:58] messenger and on and on like that how
[1:38:02] can we break that
[1:38:04] cycle praise the name of our Lord that
[1:38:07] you know you're not only over coming on
[1:38:11] Sunday praise the name of our Lord
[1:38:14] You're Not only dressing well on
[1:38:17] Sunday when it comes to
[1:38:19] Monday I put on shorts
[1:38:24] tight I'm A working
[1:38:28] class let us break that
[1:38:31] cycle when it come to Monday I can wear
[1:38:36] Nails red yellow blue you know these
[1:38:42] days there also Nails which are silver
[1:38:44] or
[1:38:47] colorless but you wear
[1:38:49] them it's the same
[1:38:52] thing or you put clear on
[1:38:57] them it's the same
[1:39:00] Spirit we need to break that
[1:39:03] cycle praise the name of our when you
[1:39:06] are good to me I'll be good to you how
[1:39:10] about when I'm
[1:39:12] bad I'll also be bad we need to break
[1:39:15] that
[1:39:16] ccle praise the name of our Lord at home
[1:39:20] when you give me I'll be obedient
[1:39:24] when you don't give me I'll be
[1:39:26] rebellious we need to break that
[1:39:30] cycle praise the name of the Lord by
[1:39:32] allowing Christ to come and live within
[1:39:37] us that when you are challenged at any
[1:39:41] time you'll not drop
[1:39:44] back you'll not
[1:39:46] backslide you not fall from the
[1:39:49] truth but then you'll always be
[1:39:51] encouraged by the truth
[1:39:54] you'll desire the word of God you desire
[1:39:57] to be obedient to the word of
[1:39:59] God not in
[1:40:02] out I'm in light I'm in
[1:40:06] darkness but your testimony is
[1:40:10] constant praise the name of our Lord you
[1:40:12] know it is
[1:40:14] constant to continue in the thing that
[1:40:17] the Lord has told you to
[1:40:20] do praise the name of the Lord you know
[1:40:23] the devil like when he tempted the Lord
[1:40:25] Jesus Christ the Bible says he left him
[1:40:29] for a
[1:40:30] season after some time then he came back
[1:40:34] there's a Time Jesus was
[1:40:36] preaching and when he was preaching then
[1:40:39] the woman Rose how blessed are the PS
[1:40:43] that you
[1:40:45] CED how blessed is the
[1:40:48] womb she wanted
[1:40:51] attention Jesus said
[1:40:55] yes blessed are they that hear the word
[1:40:57] of
[1:40:58] God told her here what I'm
[1:41:02] preaching praise the name of our Lord
[1:41:04] again he's on another
[1:41:06] mission and then the Devil Comes they
[1:41:09] are going to kill you there he keeps on
[1:41:12] coming the cycle keeps on
[1:41:15] going but you see even if the Devil
[1:41:19] Comes you need to be ready to resist him
[1:41:23] the Bible says resist the
[1:41:26] devil and he will flee
[1:41:29] away and he flees and again he comes
[1:41:32] back you keep on
[1:41:34] resisting resisting resisting and as
[1:41:38] long as we are still living in this
[1:41:40] V they are bodies of
[1:41:43] Temptation they are bodies of Temptation
[1:41:46] until these
[1:41:48] bodies have been
[1:41:50] changed that's when you say I'm free
[1:41:52] from tempt
[1:41:55] I'm free from trials I'm free from
[1:41:59] persecutions because we live in V
[1:42:02] bodies Our Lord Jesus Christ right now
[1:42:06] he lives in a glorified
[1:42:09] body praise the name of our Lord then
[1:42:12] there are theophonic
[1:42:13] bodies the sleeping sins who are living
[1:42:16] who have gone into those
[1:42:19] bodies now at the rapture
[1:42:23] we shall put on the glorified
[1:42:27] body and the glorified
[1:42:29] body can never be
[1:42:33] persecuted praise the name of the Lord
[1:42:36] because even if you Lo it
[1:42:38] here it passes through the
[1:42:40] wall even if you put fire there it can
[1:42:44] do nothing to it because it can go in
[1:42:47] the
[1:42:47] air can walk on the
[1:42:50] water praise the name of our Lord so as
[1:42:52] long as we're living in these
[1:42:55] bod the devil has opportunity to come to
[1:42:59] us to bring this the natural
[1:43:02] environment can also affect us as long
[1:43:06] as we living in this B praise the name
[1:43:08] of our no wonder what the Bible says
[1:43:11] that he has filled us with the Holy
[1:43:14] Spirit until the day of our
[1:43:17] Redemption that means the bodies are not
[1:43:20] yet
[1:43:21] redeemed the bodies that we're living in
[1:43:24] but the soul has been retained but the
[1:43:27] bodies are not yet rained so the bodies
[1:43:30] can be tempted the bodies can be killed
[1:43:34] the bodies can
[1:43:35] fall the bodies can be
[1:43:38] affected praise the name of our Lord so
[1:43:40] now in the condition that we're
[1:43:43] living praise the name of our Lord we
[1:43:45] need to see that we are fully
[1:43:50] armed praise the name of our Lord we
[1:43:52] have God living in us to give us the
[1:43:56] ability to overcome whatever we are
[1:43:58] going through praise the name of our
[1:44:01] Lord and don't so much look at the
[1:44:03] natural what you are going through but
[1:44:06] see what the Lord can do with you in
[1:44:09] thetion that you are going through
[1:44:11] praise the name of our Lord not all the
[1:44:13] time on this all the time on this where
[1:44:17] it's the Lord living in all
[1:44:18] this praise the name of our Lord so the
[1:44:21] devil keeps on coming keep on coming
[1:44:24] keep on coming praise the name of our
[1:44:27] Lord you know in the
[1:44:30] Millennium when you read in Revelations
[1:44:32] chapter
[1:44:34] 20 the Bible says the
[1:44:37] bride came in the first
[1:44:40] resurrection and then they were living
[1:44:42] with
[1:44:43] Christ but then there were some people
[1:44:46] who were not
[1:44:48] saved but they lived in that
[1:44:50] time in the millennium
[1:44:54] and the devil was bound a thousand
[1:44:57] years now you see this when the devil
[1:45:00] was released at the end of a thousand
[1:45:04] years what did he do he went and
[1:45:07] deceived those
[1:45:09] people who were not
[1:45:12] redeemed but couldn't deceive the
[1:45:15] bride he deceived the
[1:45:17] others and then they came to fight
[1:45:19] Christ and the
[1:45:21] bride so we we need the blood of Jesus
[1:45:25] Christ to overcome the devil praise the
[1:45:28] name of our Lord that's what we need the
[1:45:31] life of Jesus Christ will give us the
[1:45:34] victory to overcome the devil praise the
[1:45:38] name of our Lord blessed be the name of
[1:45:40] our
[1:45:41] Lord amen now let us continue to this
[1:45:44] script this
[1:45:46] message in the message questions and
[1:45:49] answers brother Bram says but now this
[1:45:52] speak
[1:45:54] is the main
[1:45:56] thing then in the
[1:45:59] resurrection those
[1:46:02] gases and
[1:46:04] acids and things come right back into
[1:46:07] the place and develop this picture
[1:46:12] again now this picture was not taken
[1:46:17] when you were 16 or 18 or 20 years old
[1:46:24] at your
[1:46:29] best when was it taken before there was
[1:46:33] a foundation of the
[1:46:36] world it was put in God's Great
[1:46:41] Fire and then the only thing it
[1:46:46] did it was futured itself here for you
[1:46:49] to make your choice
[1:46:53] then you become a servant of
[1:46:55] God him for knowing
[1:46:58] it makes him a makes him a
[1:47:02] redeemer as we've been through it then
[1:47:06] the picture is
[1:47:09] absolutely this is the
[1:47:11] negative the negative part of
[1:47:16] life is what where you are living
[1:47:20] now now let us try to pick it up so
[1:47:24] brother is saying that in the life we
[1:47:27] are
[1:47:28] living is a
[1:47:36] negative praise the name of our Lord so
[1:47:39] he says it's a
[1:47:41] negative it is a
[1:47:43] shadow in this life there is
[1:47:48] sorrow in this life there is
[1:47:51] sickness in in this life there is hunger
[1:47:55] in this life there is
[1:47:57] lacking in this life there is being
[1:48:02] disappointed in this life there is
[1:48:04] growing
[1:48:06] old in this life there is becoming
[1:48:13] week in this life there is being
[1:48:19] disappointed so he says it is a negative
[1:48:23] but there is a positive
[1:48:26] life and that positive
[1:48:28] life There Is No Death there's no sorrow
[1:48:33] there's no weakness there's no growing
[1:48:35] old it's an
[1:48:38] eternity praise the name of our Lord and
[1:48:41] then he's saying right now we are living
[1:48:43] in
[1:48:44] this you know where you know there is
[1:48:49] negative at your best time maybe you are
[1:48:51] 18 years or 16 or 20
[1:48:56] years but he says the picture of your
[1:49:02] best was taken before the foundation of
[1:49:05] the
[1:49:06] world but here we are living in the
[1:49:10] negative then he says if there is a
[1:49:14] negative there is going to be a
[1:49:17] positive before a negative
[1:49:23] if this is a
[1:49:25] negative there is got to be a positive
[1:49:30] somewhere and this ain't the real
[1:49:35] thing this is only a foreshadow of the
[1:49:39] real thing that is to
[1:49:42] come now you got it so I don't
[1:49:46] care what they will do with
[1:49:49] you they can destroy that Prof
[1:49:57] you know like maybe the animals have
[1:49:59] eaten or they have bur it say that
[1:50:04] that's not the main
[1:50:05] issue then he says they can destroy that
[1:50:10] profile that picture in God's Great G up
[1:50:15] [Music]
[1:50:17] there it cannot destroy it
[1:50:22] it's in heaven praise the name of our
[1:50:25] Lord so the real
[1:50:27] you has been
[1:50:31] predestinated praise the name of our
[1:50:32] Lord the real you of
[1:50:35] you
[1:50:37] Eternal praise the name of our Lord here
[1:50:40] we are passing through
[1:50:42] time to be tempted to be tried a season
[1:50:47] of
[1:50:47] Happiness a season of
[1:50:50] Sorrow a season of of rejoicing a season
[1:50:54] of morning we are going through that
[1:50:58] praise the name of our Lord but the
[1:51:00] reality
[1:51:01] is God praise the name of our Lord has
[1:51:05] given us eternal life and that etern
[1:51:08] life is within us so even if we pass
[1:51:12] through the seasons of
[1:51:14] negatives they are not going to consum
[1:51:17] us praise the name of our they're not
[1:51:20] going to consume us
[1:51:22] pass through that but during that season
[1:51:26] of
[1:51:27] negative that's when he saw the mighty
[1:51:29] Revelations of
[1:51:31] God to say even if the skin worms
[1:51:34] destroy this
[1:51:36] body yet in my flesh I'm going to see my
[1:51:41] redeemer praise the name of our Lord he
[1:51:43] was so
[1:51:44] confident that he looked beyond the
[1:51:47] veil and he saw the promises of God so
[1:51:51] brother Bram says
[1:51:53] God has the best of us in his
[1:51:56] ALB which is
[1:51:59] eternal praise the name of our who you
[1:52:02] are praise the name of our Lord and as
[1:52:04] we are speaking here we have our the
[1:52:07] bodies in
[1:52:08] heaven that when you live this Natural
[1:52:11] Body you go into the body
[1:52:14] theop praise the name of so we shouldn't
[1:52:17] allow the seasons of
[1:52:20] negatives to throw us off
[1:52:23] to take us back to disappoint us but we
[1:52:27] need to keep on
[1:52:29] striving we on moving praise the name of
[1:52:33] our Lord don't allow the conditions
[1:52:35] you're going
[1:52:36] through to take you away from
[1:52:38] God praise the name of our Lord don't
[1:52:41] allow if things are failing at a place
[1:52:44] of
[1:52:44] work let them not take you away from God
[1:52:48] if things are not good at home let them
[1:52:50] not take you away from God
[1:52:53] if your health is not good let it not
[1:52:55] take you away from God praise the name
[1:52:58] of our Lord don't allow
[1:53:00] anything take you away from Christ
[1:53:03] because those are temporary
[1:53:05] things a
[1:53:07] season praise the name of there just a
[1:53:11] season ask God to give you the grace to
[1:53:14] go through the challenges you're going
[1:53:16] through to go through the disappointment
[1:53:18] you're going
[1:53:20] through sometimes you can expect this
[1:53:24] something else happen What do you do
[1:53:27] keep on trusting in the praise the name
[1:53:30] of and don't allow the devil to take a
[1:53:34] hold of you because you're in the
[1:53:36] seasons of
[1:53:39] negatives praise the name of our Lord
[1:53:42] now let us take a
[1:53:44] turn praise the name of our
[1:53:47] Lord the first
[1:53:50] Dream he dreamed
[1:53:53] when there was seven healthy
[1:53:58] cows very well
[1:54:01] favored time of
[1:54:03] rejoicing time of
[1:54:05] celebrating then afterward saw thin
[1:54:10] ones coming to start eating the seven
[1:54:13] big
[1:54:15] ones this is strange they ate but they
[1:54:19] still remain the
[1:54:20] same and then same night he dreamed also
[1:54:25] about
[1:54:26] weight and it scared
[1:54:30] him until they called Joseph to
[1:54:32] interpret the
[1:54:34] dream so in verse 28 he says this is the
[1:54:38] thing which I have spoken unto
[1:54:42] Pharaoh what God is about to
[1:54:46] do he shows to
[1:54:48] Pharaoh behold there come seven years of
[1:54:52] great plenty throughout all the land of
[1:55:01] Egypt a season of Great
[1:55:04] Harvest being happy What the Lord Has
[1:55:08] Done For Me Oh I'm strong oh I can do
[1:55:12] this seven plenty
[1:55:14] years but after the seven plent
[1:55:18] years seven years of fine
[1:55:25] so he says and there shall arise them
[1:55:28] seven years of
[1:55:34] famine and all the Plenty shall be
[1:55:37] forgotten in the land of
[1:55:41] Egypt and the famine shall consume the
[1:55:46] land praise the name of the Lord he's
[1:55:50] telling him this is what is going to
[1:55:53] happen so what do you do be ye
[1:55:57] ready praise the name of the Lord just
[1:56:00] as we are in the day
[1:56:02] now be ready for the
[1:56:04] night and some
[1:56:06] people if he knows he doesn't have a
[1:56:11] torch or if he knows there is a place
[1:56:13] where people
[1:56:15] kill he says I better leave
[1:56:18] early and then he goes back he's
[1:56:21] preparing for the night
[1:56:23] praise the name of the Lord he says I'm
[1:56:25] going to
[1:56:26] delay says let me call this B
[1:56:30] man and tell him you know I'm reaching
[1:56:33] Ginger at
[1:56:35] midnight and I want you to help me and
[1:56:37] pick me
[1:56:38] from he
[1:56:41] preparing so when there is
[1:56:44] plenty you need to
[1:56:46] prepare when there's
[1:56:49] nothing praise the name of our Lord you
[1:56:51] need to to
[1:56:54] prepare and this is one thing each of us
[1:56:57] should
[1:56:59] do praise the name of our Lord you need
[1:57:02] to
[1:57:03] prepare if you are a young man growing
[1:57:08] up you need to
[1:57:11] prepare challenges
[1:57:13] come you need to prepare for every stage
[1:57:16] of
[1:57:19] life because there is a time you PL
[1:57:22] and there is a time you harvest but
[1:57:25] there's a time you can't plant and
[1:57:28] harvest so what do you do you
[1:57:32] store praise the name of the Lord you
[1:57:35] store there's a time you can
[1:57:38] earn and there's a time you can't earn
[1:57:41] what do you do when you ear what do you
[1:57:44] do do I go to all the places I
[1:57:48] know let me buy this expensive shirt
[1:57:55] been
[1:57:57] missing I've wear this one of the
[1:58:00] designers what about in the time of need
[1:58:03] you're not going to eat that
[1:58:06] shirt and when you try to sell it
[1:58:15] noes how much did you buy
[1:58:17] it I 100,000
[1:58:26] but this one has wasted this
[1:58:30] opportunity God has given him and he has
[1:58:34] wasted
[1:58:35] it so Joseph was telling
[1:58:39] far we need to be
[1:58:42] careful when we have
[1:58:45] plenty praise the name of the Lord you
[1:58:47] know there are some
[1:58:49] people when they cook food they cook
[1:58:52] more than what they can
[1:58:59] eat throws it but now there is a time to
[1:59:02] become
[1:59:04] hungry and you can't go back where you
[1:59:07] thrown
[1:59:08] it praise the name of the Lord so then
[1:59:11] Joseph was saying and the plant shall
[1:59:14] not be known in the land by reason of
[1:59:16] the famine
[1:59:17] following verse 31
[1:59:36] for it shall be
[1:59:40] Grievous says it will be so
[1:59:45] terrible and for that the dream was
[1:59:47] doubled and far T it is because the
[1:59:50] thing is established by God and God will
[1:59:52] shortly bring it to
[2:00:07] pass praise the name of the Lord so we
[2:00:11] also need to be careful with our
[2:00:13] Liv when you are strong do as much as
[2:00:17] you can because a time will come when
[2:00:20] you are weak
[2:00:22] it will come praise the name of our Lord
[2:00:25] when you are healthy do the best you can
[2:00:29] the time of sickness is
[2:00:31] coming when you are during that time do
[2:00:35] as much as you can because the night is
[2:00:38] coming praise the name of the Lord so we
[2:00:41] just need to be
[2:00:44] careful
[2:00:47] now let me go into this
[2:00:50] message investment
[2:00:53] he
[2:00:55] says I do not believe in some of these
[2:00:58] get rich overnight
[2:01:03] Investments either by some unidentified
[2:01:07] business now any good business any good
[2:01:13] businessman wouldn't take a chance like
[2:01:16] that maybe on your life s
[2:01:24] your
[2:01:25] earnings and you wouldn't invest it in
[2:01:28] some G night
[2:01:34] rich and it is
[2:01:37] unidentified someone run with some kind
[2:01:41] of an
[2:01:43] idea here we got a certain F
[2:01:46] here there's no background to
[2:01:50] it I think a good sound thinking
[2:01:55] man would be foolish to try to make
[2:01:59] investment in such a company as
[2:02:04] that and we've had many of them
[2:02:07] around ah you put this you're going to
[2:02:09] get this put this you're going to get
[2:02:12] this you put in nothing comes back then
[2:02:16] he says because I had a friend one
[2:02:19] time that tried such a
[2:02:23] and when he did he lost everything he
[2:02:28] had he lost all his life's
[2:02:32] ear about ready to
[2:02:37] retire he thought well I'll take this
[2:02:41] church because the man seemed to be he
[2:02:44] knew what he was talking
[2:02:48] about but come to find out the company
[2:02:51] was just a make belief
[2:02:59] company and no stocks on
[2:03:02] nothing so the poor fellow lost
[2:03:05] everything he
[2:03:09] had so I think if a man wants to make a
[2:03:13] good
[2:03:15] investment he should
[2:03:17] first
[2:03:19] check his company or whatever is making
[2:03:23] his investment
[2:03:25] in and find out what is going to
[2:03:28] do and I think a sensible thinking
[2:03:32] person would do
[2:03:34] that praise the name of our Lord you are
[2:03:37] preparing for the uncertain
[2:03:39] time and you know you want to generate
[2:03:43] income praise the name of our Lord you
[2:03:46] know like you have
[2:03:47] children and you're not raising your
[2:03:49] children well
[2:03:52] you're not
[2:03:53] investing praise the name of the Lord
[2:03:56] you're not giving your children you know
[2:03:58] some kind of training or
[2:04:03] tutorship you know in the Old
[2:04:05] Testament they could take the children
[2:04:07] to
[2:04:09] tutors to train them to prepare them now
[2:04:13] we have schools and you don't take them
[2:04:16] to
[2:04:17] school ah those ones
[2:04:20] no what what about the future
[2:04:23] ahead you know there are some parents
[2:04:25] who don't want to take their children to
[2:04:28] school I didn't go to school so they can
[2:04:31] also not go to
[2:04:33] school there is danger
[2:04:35] ahead there is a need ahead how are you
[2:04:38] going to be
[2:04:41] helped you know in old
[2:04:44] age you may not be able to do
[2:04:47] much right now you can do a
[2:04:50] lot so when you are
[2:04:52] old and your house is
[2:04:55] collapsing the house is like
[2:04:58] this and then they get you in the house
[2:05:01] and you didn't invest in your
[2:05:03] children the child
[2:05:05] [Music]

[2:06:45] work and when you get work why don't you
[2:06:48] do it to the best

[2:06:54] of when they talk about a person who is
[2:06:57] Sincere you are there a person who is
[2:06:59] hard working you are there that's how
[2:07:01] you maintain your work but now if you

[2:07:36] prepare for the days
[2:07:38] ahead every decision you make prepare
[2:07:42] yourself for
[2:07:43] certain because uncertainity is
[2:07:46] coming negative seasons are coming
[2:07:52] and so God now revealed to
[2:07:55] pharaoh and showed it to Joseph that
[2:07:58] there will be a time of
[2:08:00] Plenty and then there will be a time
[2:08:04] of and then Joseph told
[2:08:07] Pharaoh let us get
[2:08:10] somebody who can help collect all that
[2:08:14] much and keep it in every city to help
[2:08:20] in the time of need
[2:08:23] praise the name of the Lord the time of
[2:08:25] need will always
[2:08:27] come but now when that time of need
[2:08:31] come how do you go through that praise
[2:08:34] the name of our Lord in the book Hebrews
[2:08:37] Hebrews 4 verse
[2:08:43] 16 Hebrews 4:
[2:08:49] 16 he says
[2:08:52] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[2:08:54] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[2:08:57] and find Grace to help in the time of
[2:09:13] need amen there is
[2:09:16] need so you need Grace to help in need
[2:09:21] praise the name of our Lord and God was
[2:09:24] warning
[2:09:26] Egypt this is going to happen so Fara
[2:09:30] said there's nobody who can handle these
[2:09:35] issues than
[2:09:37] Joseph so he put Joseph in the
[2:09:41] position he put the right
[2:09:44] man praise the name of our Lord in a
[2:09:47] position to help handle the challenges
[2:09:52] when there is need and God has got
[2:09:57] solution when we're in the time
[2:10:00] of when we're in the seasons of
[2:10:04] negatives God has
[2:10:06] solutions to come and help us in that
[2:10:09] time
[2:10:10] of praise the name of our Lord and so
[2:10:13] when we are challenged out we need to
[2:10:16] rely on
[2:10:18] God praise the name of our and as we
[2:10:20] live
[2:10:22] we need to ask God for wisdom how we can
[2:10:25] handle the Affairs of life every
[2:10:27] day praise the name of our I want us to
[2:10:30] go to another scripture
[2:10:32] here and we continue on investment
[2:10:36] here praise the name of the
[2:10:40] Lord Psalms Genesis chter
[2:10:44] 41 and then verse
[2:10:47] 47 it says and in the seven PL ious
[2:10:51] years the earth brought forth by
[2:10:54] handfuls and he gathered up all the food
[2:10:56] of the seven years which were in the
[2:10:59] land of Egypt and laid up the food in
[2:11:01] the cities the food of the field which
[2:11:04] was round about every city laid up in
[2:11:07] the same and Joseph gathered corn as the
[2:11:10] sand of the sea very much until he left
[2:11:13] numbering for it was without
[2:11:20] number for
[2:12:01] so he says he
[2:12:03] collected as much as
[2:12:06] possible when it was
[2:12:09] available praise the name of the Lord he
[2:12:11] collected so when you ear you don't
[2:12:14] waste whatever You'
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:17] ear
[2:12:19] invest put into
[2:12:22] something praise the name of Lord say
[2:12:24] that it generates
[2:12:27] more it gives on bringing
[2:12:31] more praise the name of our Lord that's
[2:12:33] how you can be the Bible says and there
[2:12:36] was no bread in all the land for the
[2:12:38] famine was very s so that the land of
[2:12:41] Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted
[2:12:44] by reason of the fine
[2:12:57] and Joseph gathered all the money that
[2:12:59] was found in the land of Egypt and the
[2:13:02] land of Canaan for corn which they
[2:13:04] bought and Joseph brought the money into
[2:13:19] far and when the man failed in the land
[2:13:22] of Egypt and in the land of Canaan all
[2:13:25] the Egyptians came to Joseph and said
[2:13:28] give us bread why should we die in thy
[2:13:31] presence for the money fath
[2:13:53] he said they had
[2:13:56] money but the money
[2:13:58] failed it lost
[2:14:00] value like in Zimbabwe some years
[2:14:05] ago you needed something like 8
[2:14:10] million you put the money on the
[2:14:13] wheelbarrow to buy a Loof of
[2:14:17] bread money
[2:14:19] fail so money can fail any
[2:14:23] time so having or keeping
[2:14:27] money is just not the best
[2:14:30] investment you put it to make
[2:14:35] work you know you put it to make more
[2:14:41] money you know in that same message we
[2:14:44] reading brother Bram was
[2:14:47] saying it's not a good
[2:14:50] idea to keep your money in your
[2:14:52] pocket many people say I would just put
[2:14:55] it in my
[2:14:57] pocket but you
[2:14:59] know you business men and
[2:15:02] women you don't think in those terms
[2:15:06] it's not good thing because it can be
[2:15:09] stolen the best is to it is best to have
[2:15:13] it in
[2:15:16] circulation like the Lord said one time
[2:15:19] he gave so many
[2:15:21] talents to so many and such and then
[2:15:26] they made an investment with
[2:15:29] it and those who made a sound a good
[2:15:32] Sound
[2:15:34] Investment he gave them
[2:15:37] [Music]
[2:15:39] dividends but when the one man
[2:15:42] said I just kept
[2:15:46] it didn't want to take any chances on it
[2:15:51] put it in my pocket I buried it
[2:15:55] somewhere he taken that he had given to
[2:15:59] him and gave it
[2:16:01] another that had drawn more
[2:16:04] dividends that to put it in a good
[2:16:08] investment and that's the way our Lord
[2:16:11] doing
[2:16:13] things praise the name of our Lord you
[2:16:16] earning
[2:16:18] invest praise the name of our Lord not
[2:16:21] just keeping I have accumulated this
[2:16:23] amount of
[2:16:24] money and the more it is kept the more
[2:16:28] it loses
[2:16:31] value what can buy maybe a plot of
[2:16:36] land at the beginning of the year at the
[2:16:40] end of the year it can't buy that
[2:16:43] land so when the money
[2:16:46] failed Joseph told them bring your CLE
[2:16:51] so CLE has more value than
[2:16:57] money hey now it is
[2:17:00] investment praise the name of the Lord
[2:17:03] so you just keep there your money the
[2:17:05] one putting it in animals is better
[2:17:08] than because they
[2:17:12] multiply praise the name of our Lord
[2:17:15] that's what he was telling Joseph was
[2:17:16] telling them and now when the animals
[2:17:19] were over
[2:17:21] let us go back to verse chapter
[2:17:30] 47 verse
[2:17:32] 15 and when the man failed in the land
[2:17:35] okay verse 16 and Joseph said give me
[2:17:38] your CLE and I'll give you your CLE if
[2:17:40] money
[2:17:49] fail so all the CLE was
[2:17:54] taken and when the year was
[2:17:57] ended again they said we cannot die we
[2:18:01] don't have anything but our
[2:18:05] land land has more value than
[2:18:10] animals and more than
[2:18:12] money where are you
[2:18:15] investing and now when the land is
[2:18:18] taken you become a slave
[2:18:22] you sell
[2:18:24] yourself so we need to see where we
[2:18:29] invest to help us in the time of
[2:18:32] need you don't eat all your
[2:18:35] salary praise the name of our Lord just
[2:18:38] eat everything when the job is what are
[2:18:41] you going to

[2:18:47] eat go to either those high places
[2:18:51] KFC chicken tonight tonight when you can
[2:18:56] use the same money to buy a whole
[2:19:07] thing
[2:19:09] wastefulness of course if you can afford
[2:19:11] there's no problem with
[2:19:12] that but if you are going to be in Deb
[2:19:15] all the
[2:19:16] time and then you doing such a thing
[2:19:20] that is Reck L
[2:19:24] Living Praise the name of that's
[2:19:27] reckless living so you need to learn how
[2:19:29] to invest what God has given
[2:19:34] to when God gave the other two
[2:19:38] talents he
[2:19:41] traded and got more two talents when he
[2:19:45] gave five talents he traed and
[2:19:50] that's what this natural life is even
[2:19:53] the spiritual
[2:19:55] also is that you don't remain alone but
[2:19:58] you need to bring more children to the
[2:20:01] kingdom the than when he was given one
[2:20:04] Talent he buried

[2:20:49] you can participate into the things of
[2:20:52] God praise the name of our Lord so it is
[2:20:56] good to invest
[2:20:57] right because it has
[2:21:00] benefits praise the name of our Lord now
[2:21:03] let us go and
[2:21:05] read in the Book
[2:21:07] of Psalms
[2:21:16] 15 Psalms 15
[2:21:24] and then verse
[2:21:26] one he says a sum of David Lord who
[2:21:30] shall abide in thy Tabernacle who shall
[2:21:33] dwell in thy Holy
[2:21:46] Hill he that walth uprightly and WTH
[2:21:50] right
[2:21:51] and speaketh the truth in his
[2:22:02] heart he that backbiteth not with his
[2:22:05] tongue nor do evil to his neighbor nor
[2:22:08] take up a reproach against his neighbor
[2:22:23] in whose eyes a vile person is condemned
[2:22:27] but he honor them that fear the lord he
[2:22:30] swears to his own heart and changes
[2:22:45] not he that putteth not out his money to
[2:22:49] user nor take up regard against the
[2:22:51] innocent he that does these things shall
[2:22:54] never be
[2:23:08] moved praise the name of the Lord so he
[2:23:11] says who shall dwell in the Tabernacle
[2:23:13] of
[2:23:15] God who shall dwell in His Holy
[2:23:18] Hill and then he gives the answer that
[2:23:21] we need to walk
[2:23:23] uprightly Walking In
[2:23:26] righteousness speaking the truth in his
[2:23:28] heart so when you are in the season of
