[0:00] And now I am happy all the day.
[0:08] Was it for crimes that I have done? He
[0:16] grown upon
[0:19] that tree.
[0:23] Amazing
[0:26] beauty
[0:28] grace
[0:29] unknown
[0:31] and love beyond
[0:35] the degree. At the cross, at the cross,
[0:40] at the cross, where I first saw the
[0:45] light and the burdens of my heart grow
[0:51] the way.
[0:54] It was there. By faith, I received my
[1:00] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[1:09] Well might
[1:11] the sun in darkness
[1:16] hide and shout his glories
[1:21] in.
[1:24] When Christ the mighty
[1:29] maker
[1:31] died for
[1:34] the creatures
[1:37] at the cross at the cross at the cross
[1:43] where I f
[1:46] the light and the burdens of my heart
[1:51] grow the
[1:53] [Music]
[1:55] It was there by faith. I received my
[2:01] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[2:08] By the drops of grace. By the drops
[2:12] of grief can never
[2:16] repay.
[2:18] The debt of love I own.
[2:24] [Music]
[2:25] Here alone
[2:27] I give myself
[2:31] away
[2:33] is all that I can do. At the cross. At
[2:41] the cross. At the cross. Where I first
[2:46] saw the light and the balance of my
[2:50] heart brought the way.
[2:56] It was there by faith. I received my
[3:02] side.
[3:03] And now I am happy. Oh the day. At the
[3:09] cross. At the cross. At the cross. Where
[3:15] I fast saw the light and the burdens of
[3:21] my heart. Ro away.
[3:26] It was there. By faith I receive my
[3:32] sight and now I am happy all the dream.
[3:40] Let us sing that song.
[3:42] Leave it there. If the word from you
[3:46] with gold and of silver and it's gold
[3:52] and you have to get along with a
[3:55] manger's f
[3:59] just remember in his word how he feeds
[4:04] the little bird. Take your burdens to
[4:09] the Lord and live in them. Leave it
[4:13] there. Leave it there. Leave it there.
[4:18] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[4:23] it there. Leave it there. If you trust
[4:28] and never doubt, he will surely bring
[4:32] you out. Take your burdens to the Lord
[4:37] and leave it there. Yes, leave it there.
[4:42] Leave it there. Leave it there. Take
[4:46] your burdens to the Lord and leave it
[4:50] there. Leave it there. If you trust and
[4:55] never doubt, he will surely bring you
[5:00] out. Take your burdens to the Lord and
[5:05] live in them. If your body, if your body
[5:11] suffers pain and your health, you can't
[5:16] regain
[5:17] and your soul is almost saving this
[5:22] pain. Jesus knows. Jesus knows the pain
[5:27] you feel. He can save and he can heal.
[5:33] Take your body to the Lord and leave it
[5:38] there. Just leave it there. Leave it
[5:42] there. Leave it there. Take your balance
[5:47] to the Lord and leave it there. Leave it
[5:52] there. If you trust and never doubt, he
[5:57] will surely bring you out. Take your
[6:02] bance to the Lord.

[10:09] time Lord like Philip Lord when you sent
[10:12] Philip somewhere he went there and he
[10:14] reached in the same place where he and
[10:17] he found the desire of a man Lord Jesus
[10:20] that's why Lord the man received what he
[10:22] wanted and we pray father for the
[10:24] minister who is coming Lord may he come
[10:27] in the same spot father where your
[10:29] children Lord are lacking something that
[10:31] he may speak Lord better words Lord The
[10:34] words of deliverance, the words of
[10:36] setting them free, the words of giving
[10:39] them more grace, Lord, Lord Jesus, to
[10:41] believe, to be as Christians, the words,
[10:44] Father, to encourage their hearts, to
[10:46] strengthen their worries, Lord. I pray,
[10:49] Father, Lord Jesus, may you come and
[10:51] bless our service this morning. Oh,
[10:53] hallelujah. In the mighty name, Lord
[10:55] Jesus Christ, we pray.
[10:59] [Music]
[11:06] As we prepare to hear the minister,

[11:49] The li of the valley. In him alone I
[11:55] see. All I need to cleanse and make me
[12:00] fully whole.

[12:22] morning star is the fest of 10,000 to my
[12:28] soul.

[13:25] [Music]
[13:27] He will never He will never
[13:33] know and forsake me here while I live my
[13:41] blessed way.
[13:45] A wall of fire upon me. A rising down to
[13:52] with a
[13:55] hungry soul shall feing
[14:02] up to glory
[14:05] will see his blessedness
[14:08] where our rivers of thee shall ever

[14:15] Hallelujah.
[14:17] In the li of the valley, the bright and
[14:23] morning star. He's the fairest of crown

[15:32] He's the fair of 10
[15:36] to my soul. Amen. Let us give God a hand
[15:39] of praise. Amen.
[15:43] We're happy to be back in the house of
[15:45] the Lord.
[15:47] Brother week, if you're welcome from
[15:53] actually a very far place. Thank God for
[15:56] being with us.
[15:58] He was also here with us for easy
[16:00] studies in medical school like our
[16:02] brother. So
[16:07] that is here with us
[16:09] brother
[16:11] for the grace he gave you.
[16:15] Let us pray. Father, in the name of our
[16:18] Lord Jesus Christ,
[16:21] we are so happy to be in your presence
[16:23] this evening.
[16:25] You said where two or three are gathered
[16:27] in
[16:29] you will be there in their midst. And
[16:32] Lord, we believe you are here Lord. We
[16:35] pray that father you may come and speak
[16:36] to our hearts,
[16:39] reveal yourself to us
[16:41] and even manifest yourself to us.
[16:45] Bless us all together, Lord. May you
[16:48] meet all the needs of your children,
[16:50] Lord,
[16:52] and have preeminence upon this service
[16:55] that your purpose and will may be done
[16:59] for the glory of your holy name in the
[17:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray
[17:04] this.
[17:06] Amen. Let us go right away to our
[17:08] scriptures
[17:12] in John chapter 16.
[17:16] and then verse 8 to verse 14
[17:21] I'll be taking a subject on the spirit
[17:23] of truth
[17:25] [Music]
[17:26] praise the name of our lord the bible
[17:29] says
[17:32] and when he is come he will reprove the
[17:35] world of sin of righteousness and of
[17:38] judgment
[17:42] [Music]
[17:47] of sin because they believe not on me.
[17:49] Of righteousness because I go to my
[17:51] father and you see me no more. Of
[17:53] judgment because the prince of this
[17:56] world is judged.
[18:13] I have yet many things to say unto you,
[18:16] but you cannot bear them now.
[18:24] How? But when he, the Spirit of truth,
[18:26] is come, he will guide you into all
[18:28] truth. For he shall not speak of
[18:30] himself, butsoever he shall hear, that
[18:33] shall he speak, and he will show you
[18:36] things to come.
[18:51] [Music]
[19:00] He shall glorify me for he shall receive
[19:03] of mine and shall show it unto you.
[19:14] May God sing of his word. You may be
[19:17] seated.
[19:22] We are speaking on the spirit of truth.
[19:27] We've taken a bit of series on the Holy
[19:29] Spirit.
[19:35] I think this could be the 14th service
[19:37] on the Holy Spirit.
[19:43] The good thing is that they recorded and
[19:45] on the YouTube
[19:50] and then they have put them in a series
[19:51] of the Holy Spirit
[19:57] and I have I think about either five or
[20:00] more six services on the Holy Spirit.
[20:06] Next week, God will
[20:09] I want to talk about the Holy Spirit
[20:12] guides.
[20:17] Praise the name of the Lord to see that
[20:20] we demystify
[20:22] the Holy Spirit.
[20:26] You know,
[20:35] Praise the name of our Lord
[20:37] in the message. Especially if you go to
[20:40] many churches,
[20:44] there is a lot of confusion on the Holy
[20:47] Spirit.
[20:51] And it is strange.
[20:54] There is a time there was a nudgment
[20:56] about the evidence of the Holy Spirit or
[20:59] when you receive the Holy Spirit
[21:07] and then one of the
[21:10] one of the the people who were arguing
[21:15] in the public would say this is what
[21:17] happens to the this what happens when
[21:19] you get the Holy Spirit.
[21:23] But then in private
[21:27] but get the Holy Spirit.
[21:33] Is it before baptism?
[21:36] Is it after baptism?
[21:38] But in the public
[21:41] he's going with that bandwagon because
[21:43] it's a group which think a certain
[21:45] direction
[21:49] and busy defending what they believe as
[21:51] a group.
[21:57] But individually doesn't know where it
[21:59] is.
[22:02] Very strange.
[22:04] Praise the name of our Lord. But then
[22:06] the Bible is telling us
[22:09] that in verse 13,
[22:12] how he the spirit of truth is come,
[22:18] he will guide you into all truth.
[22:24] He says the spirit of truth.
[22:27] Now
[22:29] you know there we are living in a day of
[22:32] deception.
[22:36] A lot of deception that is happening now
[22:42] until somebody may speak to you
[22:46] and then you may think what they are
[22:48] speaking is they mean it.
[22:52] but when it is something different what
[22:54] they are meaning
[22:58] I just want us to pick some few examples
[23:01] like Matthew chapter 22
[23:06] then verse 15 to verse 19
[23:10] he says then went the Pharisees and took
[23:14] counsel how they might entangle him in
[23:17] his talk
[23:20] Mark verse 15.
[23:37] You know they are the intent is to
[23:39] entangle him,
[23:44] you know. And then they said this way
[23:47] to kind of trap you around.
[23:51] And they sent out unto him their
[23:53] disciples with the Helodians, saying,
[23:55] "Master, we know that though at a true
[23:59] and teacheth the way of God in truth,
[24:02] neither carth though for any man, for
[24:05] though regard not the person of men,
[24:20] So,
[24:28] you know, they trying to befriend him,
[24:32] lift him up.
[24:34] Nobody knows things like you know.
[24:37] He preaches the truth.
[24:40] They are entangling
[24:44] asking questions in pretense,
[24:49] you know, in falsehood.
[24:52] And that's what the serpent also does.
[24:57] That's what the serpent did to Eve in
[24:59] the garden of Eden.
[25:02] Did God say
[25:05] it's as if he wants to give you better
[25:07] information.
[25:10] when he is tempting you,
[25:13] you kind of like putting you off.
[25:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Then now in
[25:20] Luke chapter 20
[25:22] and then verse 20, the Bible says, "And
[25:26] they watched him
[25:29] and sent forth SP which should find
[25:32] themselves just men that they might take
[25:36] a hold of his word, that they might
[25:39] deliver him unto the power and authority
[25:42] of the governor.
[26:08] He says to themselves like just men.
[26:16] That's what the Bible says. False
[26:18] brethren have come amongst us.
[26:23] Then they pretend to be right.
[26:27] They desire the truth
[26:30] to draw disciples after themselves.
[26:35] You know to get followers
[26:39] and you know like they ask you a
[26:41] question
[26:44] but it is to stumble you
[26:48] or to catch a hold of you.
[26:51] You know like when you go to the court
[26:53] of law
[26:56] and then you know the the the lawyer of
[26:59] the opponent is crossexamining you.
[27:05] is crossexamine is asking you question.
[27:09] They start kind of laying traps in their
[27:12] questions.
[27:15] They can ask you here a question.
[27:18] And now for you, you may think that you
[27:20] are answering them when they the
[27:22] question they asking is genuine.
[27:27] But then they are trapping you in your
[27:29] own words
[27:31] and then they use your very words to pin
[27:33] you down.
[27:36] And that's what the devil does.
[27:38] But the Holy Spirit is the spirit of
[27:42] truth,
[27:44] genuine spirit of truth.
[27:47] Praise the name of our Lord. It's about
[27:50] craftiness.
[27:53] You know, it's about a pretense or a
[27:56] falsehood.
[28:00] Praise the name of our Lord. The spirit
[28:03] of God
[28:05] is the spirit of truth.
[28:08] And you know truth.
[28:11] Praise the name of our Lord is the word
[28:13] of God.
[28:15] Praise the name of our Lord
[28:19] being the word of God.
[28:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[28:25] to John chapter 4.
[28:33] John chapter 4
[28:36] and then we read in
[28:42] we read in verse 23 to verse 24.
[28:48] He says,
[28:50] "But the hour cometh, and now is when
[28:53] the true worshippers shall worship the
[28:56] Father in spirit and in truth. For the
[28:59] Father seeketh such to worship him.
[29:19] God is a spirit and they that worship
[29:21] him must worship him in spirit and in
[29:25] truth.
[29:32] Praise the name of the Lord. So he says
[29:34] true worship
[29:36] is in the spirit of God
[29:39] and in the truth of God.
[29:43] So then it takes the spirit of truth
[29:47] to give us the truth.
[29:49] And when the spirit of truth gives us
[29:51] truth,
[29:54] he comes and takes over that truth
[29:58] and then makes it real in our lives.
[30:02] Praise the name of our Lord. I remember
[30:05] some some time ago
[30:08] we had a subject of the Ser is the Holy
[30:11] Ghost.
[30:15] And then the Holy Ghost is the spirit of
[30:19] God. So he's the one who ministers the
[30:22] word of God to us.
[30:25] And now when we receive that word of
[30:27] God,
[30:29] when we are obedient to the word of God,
[30:33] then the same spirit that has spoken to
[30:35] us
[30:38] comes and takes a residence in our lives
[30:43] and that's the baptism of the Holy
[30:44] Spirit.
[30:46] It's not something that you're going to
[30:48] imagine.
[30:50] Or maybe it is far away from me.
[30:54] Or maybe I need to wait for maybe a
[30:56] special minister to come.
[30:59] Or maybe I need to wait for a
[31:01] convention.
[31:04] It is the Holy Spirit
[31:07] speak to us the word of God.
[31:10] And then it's that same spirit of God.
[31:14] When we are obedient to the word of God,
[31:18] he makes that word real in our lives.
[31:23] He makes that word come to life in our
[31:26] lives.
[31:29] He makes that word to be manifested in
[31:32] our lives.
[31:34] It is the same Holy Spirit.
[31:38] You can't separate the Holy Spirit
[31:42] and his word
[31:44] because it is the spirit that gives you
[31:46] his word.
[31:48] Now, if it's the spirit speaking the
[31:50] word,
[31:52] praise the name of our Lord, the way our
[31:54] Lord Jesus Christ said
[31:57] that the words that I speak unto you,
[32:00] they are spirit and they are truth
[32:04] or they are spirit and their life.
[32:08] And you know, brother Brandham tells us
[32:11] that a person is no better than his
[32:14] word.
[32:17] Now if the spirit speaking the word then
[32:20] it is the same spirit
[32:23] trying to find a a place where he can
[32:26] abide
[32:29] where he can settle in our lives.
[32:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Now I just
[32:37] I just want to maybe take up something
[32:39] here.
[32:41] Let us go to first John chapter 4.
[32:45] [Music]
[32:46] First John chapter 4
[32:51] [Music]
[32:53] and then verse 5 to verse 9.
[32:57] The Bible says
[33:00] they are of the world. Therefore speak
[33:03] they of the world and the world heareth
[33:06] them.
[33:11] We are of God.
[33:14] He that knoweth God heareth us. He that
[33:18] is not of God heareth heareth not.
[33:22] Hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[33:25] the spirit of error.
[33:37] Now he's talking about hearing.
[33:41] Now this hearing is talking about
[33:45] is obedience.
[33:48] Now you hear the spirit of God
[33:52] and then you obey what the spirit is
[33:54] saying
[33:56] which is the word of God. And now from
[34:00] the obedience or from hearing
[34:03] then you get to know.
[34:07] In other words, you get the
[34:09] understanding.
[34:13] You get the revelation.
[34:15] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[34:17] now he says
[34:20] the world hears those of the world. In
[34:24] other words, they obey what the world
[34:25] tells them.
[34:29] They they they do the things of the
[34:31] world.
[34:33] Like now this evening,
[34:36] you have left your place of work
[34:39] and then you've come to church. The one
[34:41] of the world
[34:45] has left his place of work.
[34:48] He's now at the bar. He hears the world.
[34:53] He obeys the world. When it comes to
[34:56] Friday,
[34:59] now he's talking which nightclub or
[35:01] should I go and spend a whole night
[35:02] there?
[35:04] He hears the world and he obeys the
[35:07] world and therefore he loves the world.
[35:11] and he understands the world. He knows.
[35:16] So he knows which joint is the best over
[35:18] the weekend.
[35:21] He knows which musicians are going to be
[35:22] maybe at Dam Waters.
[35:27] Then he knows which musicians are going
[35:29] to be maybe at Amber.
[35:33] He knows what mission maybe are going to
[35:35] be here.
[35:40] understands,
[35:43] you know, is up to date with what's
[35:45] happening around.
[35:48] Now, that's the same thing also with us.
[35:52] If we have the spirit of truth,
[35:55] we hear the truth. We know the truth.
[36:00] So, we know what the Lord wants us to do
[36:02] in a particular situation.
[36:07] Praise the name of the Lord. When
[36:09] somebody hates you,
[36:11] now you know what to do when somebody
[36:14] hates you.
[36:17] Love your enemies.
[36:19] So now the Holy Spirit himself
[36:22] gives you the ability
[36:25] to love your enemy.
[36:27] Praise the name of our Lord. That's what
[36:30] the spirit of God does in our lives
[36:33] is that when we receive the truth which
[36:36] is the word of God,
[36:39] that word of God
[36:42] is quickened by the Holy Spirit
[36:46] in our lives. Praise the name of our
[36:49] Lord. So he says that the world hears
[36:51] their the world people the people of the
[36:54] world hear the
[36:58] but when we are of God
[37:01] we hear God
[37:04] pray our Lord what God tells us.
[37:09] Then verse seven, beloved, let us love
[37:12] one another, for love is of God, and
[37:16] that loveth is born of God and knoweth
[37:19] God.
[37:30] He that loveth not knoweth not God, for
[37:35] God is love.
[37:41] Praise the name of our Lord. If you
[37:44] don't love
[37:47] you don't know God
[37:50] because God is love.
[37:53] In this was manifested the love of God
[37:55] towards towards us because that God sent
[37:59] his only begotten son
[38:03] through him.
[38:16] If you can give me a mic. Praise the
[38:19] name of I don't know why there is
[38:20] fluctuation.
[38:22] He says God sent his son
[38:27] into the world that we might live
[38:30] through him.
[38:33] So then we are seeing here
[38:36] That manifested love
[38:40] is a life.
[38:43] You can't say I love God.
[38:46] But there's no manifestation of that in
[38:49] your life.
[38:52] You cannot be alive in Christ
[38:56] without God's love.
[38:59] So hearing the word,
[39:02] you know, it gets you to know the word
[39:07] or to know God
[39:10] and certainly you love God.
[39:13] So you hear the word,
[39:16] you know God,
[39:18] you love God and it brings the life of
[39:22] God himself.
[39:24] Christ himself living in us.
[39:27] No longer I
[39:30] praise the name of our Lord, but the
[39:32] Lord Jesus that lives in me.
[39:35] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[39:37] to 8
[39:41] and then verse 42.
[39:47] The Bible says, Jesus said unto them,
[39:52] if you were if God were your father, you
[39:55] would love me. For I proceeded forth and
[39:58] came from God. Neither came I of myself,
[40:01] but he sent me.
[40:16] So he's saying if you were of God,
[40:20] you would love me. In other words, you
[40:22] would hear what I'm saying.
[40:25] You would be obedient to what I'm
[40:27] telling you.
[40:29] Then he says, why don't you understand?
[40:37] In other words, why do you lack
[40:39] revelation?
[40:43] Why don't you know?
[40:46] Then he says, even because you cannot
[40:49] hear,
[40:53] in other words, you can't obey the word
[40:55] of God.
[40:59] Praise the name of our Lord. Day of God,
[41:03] day of God
[41:05] will hear the word of God
[41:09] will be obedient to the word of God.
[41:13] Praise the name of our Lord. So they
[41:15] will be able to receive the life of
[41:16] Jesus Christ.
[41:19] Then he says, you are of your father the
[41:22] devil and the lust of your father you
[41:25] will do. He was a murderer from the
[41:27] beginning and abode not in the truth
[41:30] because there is no truth in him. When
[41:32] he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his
[41:34] own, for he is a liar and the father of
[41:37] it.
[42:07] The Bible says
[42:10] never abide in the truth
[42:14] because there's no truth in him.
[42:17] So then for us when we hear the word
[42:22] then we we get understanding of the word
[42:29] and now that makes us to abide in the
[42:32] word
[42:35] and it identifies us
[42:38] to be of God or not of God.
[42:43] The word is the identification.
[42:47] Praise the name of our Lord. Are we of
[42:49] God or we are not of God?
[42:53] Now in the message to see Jesus,
[42:57] he says, "I'm so happy tonight to know
[43:02] that Jesus has not forsaken the people
[43:04] in this great day that we are living
[43:11] under this great strain that we are all
[43:13] under today.
[43:20] The Lord has not left us.
[43:24] He said, I will notless.
[43:29] I will pray the father and will give you
[43:31] another comforter
[43:35] which is the Holy Spirit and will abide
[43:38] with you forever,
[43:41] even the spirit of truth
[43:44] whom the world cannot receive.
[43:47] I am very thankful
[43:50] that this spirit of truth
[43:53] was to be with us to the end.
[43:57] And that spirit of truth
[44:00] is none other
[44:03] but the Lord Jesus himself
[44:06] in the spiritual form.
[44:09] For he said, "A little while the world
[44:11] sees me no more,
[44:16] yet you shall see me, for I'll be with
[44:19] you, even in you to the end of the
[44:22] world." And that means tonight
[44:27] and wherever we are,
[44:30] we have the comforting words of knowing
[44:33] that Jesus will be with us.
[44:38] Many of you people here
[44:42] who got little churches,
[44:48] no matter how small the church is,
[44:54] Jesus said, even two or three
[44:59] are gathered together in my name,
[45:03] he would be with them.
[45:05] What a comforting word is to know.
[45:10] No matter how small our little
[45:12] congregation is,
[45:17] yet the Lord Jesus is with us and we are
[45:19] happy for that.
[45:31] Praise the name of our Lord.
[45:34] So now he says whether however small it
[45:36] is
[45:40] whether it is because he said two or
[45:43] three.
[45:45] So it doesn't matter how small the
[45:47] congregation is
[45:52] as long as the incense of gathering is
[45:55] in the name of the Lord.
[46:00] Then Jesus says I will be in their
[46:02] midst.
[46:04] Praise the name of our Lord. What does
[46:07] that imply?
[46:08] A husband and a wife
[46:12] when they are gathered in the name of
[46:13] Jesus Christ,
[46:16] the Lord will always come there.
[46:19] Praise the name of our Lord. So it
[46:21] encourages us
[46:23] when you gather in the name of the Lord,
[46:27] Jesus says I will be there.
[46:31] So the whole thing we need to do
[46:34] is to be obedient to the word of God.
[46:38] And when you hear the word
[46:41] and see that you are abide in that word.
[46:46] Praise the name of our Lord. Abide and
[46:48] be established in that word.
[46:53] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[46:55] continue in the word,
[47:01] Then he says, "You shall know the truth
[47:06] and the truth shall make you free.
[47:10] Praise the name of our Lord." So now we
[47:13] see here in the message the comforter.
[47:18] He says, "There it is. And how long is
[47:22] he going to abide?
[47:27] Forever.
[47:29] Then what then what is the word of God?
[47:34] What is our comfort today?
[47:40] It is when we receive the baptism of the
[47:42] Holy Ghost
[47:45] and the power of the living God living
[47:47] in us.
[47:51] And that is with the word, the word of
[47:53] the living God.
[47:57] We stand.
[48:23] That's
[48:38] it.
[49:12] Get away.
[49:17] All
[49:32] right.
[49:41] All right.
[49:47] X
[50:07] is
[51:05] Are you
[51:25] never seen?
[51:32] the word of God.
[51:35] Praise the name of our Lord. We have to
[51:38] be obedient to the word
[51:41] and then the spirit of God
[51:44] will come and quicken that word.
[51:48] We make that word manifested in our
[51:50] lives.
[51:53] Praise the name of the Lord.
[51:56] Now we see in the Matthew chapter 2
[52:01] we had the wise men
[52:04] you know they came from the east
[52:07] and then they reached Jerusalem
[52:10] and then they were crying where is he
[52:11] born the king of the Jews.
[52:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Then the
[52:18] Bible says the whole of Jerusalem was
[52:20] troubled.
[52:24] They were wondering
[52:26] is the king born.
[52:28] Then these people because the star had
[52:31] disappeared from them.
[52:35] They went to Herod the king
[52:38] and then demanded of him where is the
[52:40] king born?
[52:43] And Herod knew the people to answer that
[52:45] question.
[52:48] So he called the the priests and the
[52:50] secretes.
[52:53] and he was asking them where should the
[52:55] Messiah be born.
[52:59] So they were able to tell him the
[53:01] scripture.
[53:04] Praise the name of our Lord.
[53:07] But then here
[53:09] we see that they were able to know where
[53:11] he should be born.
[53:16] But the question is who went to worship?
[53:21] Praise the name of our Lord. They were
[53:23] able to know the truth,
[53:26] but then they didn't go forward to
[53:29] worship.
[53:32] But then he says, worship in the spirit
[53:34] and in the truth.
[53:38] Praise the name of our Lord. And for
[53:40] them, they never went to worship Christ.
[53:44] They had a knowledge of the word
[53:48] but that word could not be made life
[53:53] because they didn't obey that word
[53:56] and that should be the same thing also
[53:58] with us. It should be it could be the
[54:01] same thing with us.
[54:03] You know you know the quotes of the
[54:05] prophet.
[54:07] You can quote this. You can quote this.
[54:10] You can pick this scripture. You can put
[54:12] this scripture but the question is those
[54:16] things become a living reality in your
[54:18] life.
[54:20] Praise the name of our lord. There are
[54:23] people who can entangle you with their
[54:24] quot scriptures.
[54:28] [Music]
[54:30] Didn't god said this for you. What are
[54:32] you doing? And that's how the devil does
[54:35] the false accusation.
[54:39] you know, you know, he has stolen,
[54:43] you know, he's quoting,
[54:46] but he can't live that same life.
[54:49] But then as we are called to live the
[54:52] life of Jesus Christ,
[54:55] that when we hear the word, let us not
[54:58] be like Satan,
[55:01] he never abide in truth.
[55:05] And to abide in the truth means that you
[55:08] do that word,
[55:10] you perform that word.
[55:13] Wherever you are, your mind is let me
[55:15] follow what the Lord is telling me to
[55:17] do.
[55:21] Regardless of who is seeing me and who
[55:22] is not seeing me,
[55:25] you are given over to the truth.
[55:31] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[55:33] know when you yield to it
[55:36] then he says you shall know the truth
[55:38] and the truth shall make you free.
[55:42] And you know knowledge to the Jews
[55:48] is an action.
[55:52] But then to the Gentiles or to the
[55:54] Greeks
[55:57] to know is just a a a knowledge or some
[56:01] kind of information.
[56:05] Praise the name of our Lord. But then
[56:07] this knowing he's talking about
[56:10] is that you go through it. It's an a
[56:13] personal experience.
[56:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Something
[56:19] that is personal to you.
[56:23] something you know that is real in your
[56:26] life.
[56:28] Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us
[56:31] go to John chapter 14
[56:35] and then verse 17
[56:38] he says
[56:41] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[56:44] cannot receive because it sees him not
[56:46] neither knows him but you shall know him
[56:49] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[56:51] you.
[57:03] Praise the name of our Lord. So Christ
[57:05] is identifying himself
[57:09] as the spirit of truth
[57:12] and as the spirit of truth,
[57:15] he speaks to us the truth
[57:17] and the truth is the word of God.
[57:21] So when we hear the word of God, it is
[57:24] the spirit of God that is speaking to
[57:26] us.
[57:28] Praise the name of our Lord. So you need
[57:30] to be obedient to the truth
[57:35] which is spoken by the spirit
[57:38] for the spirit to come down in our
[57:40] lives.
[57:42] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[57:44] first Peter chapter 1 verse 22,
[57:51] The Bible says,
[57:53] "Seeing you have purified your souls in
[57:56] obeying the truth through the spirit and
[57:58] to unfin love, O brethren, see that you
[58:01] love one another with a pure heart
[58:04] fervently.
[58:21] So the Bible says when we obey the word
[58:27] which is the truth
[58:29] then our souls are purified.
[58:33] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[58:35] you live evil thoughts.
[58:39] You live evil understanding.
[58:42] You live things that are contrary to God
[58:46] and then you are obedient to the word.
[58:50] So when you obey the word,
[58:53] it brings a purification in your soul.
[58:58] It actually it is a sanctification.
[59:02] Praise the name of our Lord. And it is
[59:04] the spirit now cleaning you by the word
[59:06] he has spoken to you.
[59:12] And then the spirit makes you a clean
[59:14] vessel
[59:18] such that he can come himself
[59:22] and he dwells in you. He's cleaning his
[59:26] own house.
[59:29] He's building his own temple.
[59:32] You know by giving you the word.
[59:35] So you are being built upon the
[59:37] foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[59:42] You can become a dwelling place of God.
[59:48] God himself building you.
[59:51] Praise the name of our Lord. Taking you
[59:54] through different situations.
[59:56] And then the Bible says that Christ
[59:59] learned obedience
[1:00:03] by the things he suffered,
[1:00:06] by the things he went through
[1:00:09] and the strations that come in our
[1:00:11] lives,
[1:00:14] the strations that come in our lives,
[1:00:17] they are to test our obedience
[1:00:24] to the word of God.
[1:00:26] That's what happens. So now when you go
[1:00:29] through a challenging situation,
[1:00:33] how are you going to handle that
[1:00:35] situation?
[1:00:38] What is going to be your reaction?
[1:00:42] And brother Brandham says
[1:00:45] God likes taking us through those
[1:00:47] sessions.
[1:00:53] He likes proving us.
[1:00:58] Praise the name of our Lord. Stretched
[1:01:00] at home,
[1:01:02] stretched at place of work or in the
[1:01:05] community.
[1:01:07] Somebody you are walking and then
[1:01:08] somebody steps on you.
[1:01:11] Are you going to slap them?
[1:01:16] You know they are checking you. Are you
[1:01:18] the same like the people of the world?
[1:01:27] or for you you are different.
[1:01:30] Praise the name of our Lord when they
[1:01:32] revile you.
[1:01:36] You also say let me also release what I
[1:01:39] have.
[1:01:42] You know they are testing.
[1:01:45] Are you obedient to the word which has
[1:01:47] been spoken to you?
[1:01:51] Praise the name of God. It's a proving,
[1:01:55] you know, are you obedient?
[1:01:58] Are you following the word of God? Are
[1:02:00] you doing what the spirit tells you? Oh,
[1:02:03] you are now I have my right now.
[1:02:08] I can do what I want to do.
[1:02:11] So now in Ephesians chapter one
[1:02:14] and then verse 12
[1:02:16] he says
[1:02:19] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:02:21] glory who first trusted in Christ in
[1:02:24] whom you also trusted after that you
[1:02:27] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[1:02:29] your salvation whom also after that you
[1:02:32] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[1:02:34] Spirit of promise which is the earnest
[1:02:37] of our inheritance until the redemption
[1:02:40] of the purchased possession unto the
[1:02:42] praise of his glory.
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:02:51] Okay.
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:20] Praise the name of our Lord. He says we
[1:03:23] heard the word.
[1:03:26] We believed the word.
[1:03:29] We obeyed the word.
[1:03:32] Then he says the spirit,
[1:03:35] the holy spirit
[1:03:38] came down
[1:03:41] and seals us.
[1:03:44] Praise the name of our lord. We all has
[1:03:46] to be hearing the truth.
[1:03:50] Then the holy spirit comes down.
[1:03:53] It's the spirit of God that speaks to
[1:03:55] us.
[1:03:57] And then when the spirit speaks to you
[1:04:00] and the spirit of God speaks the word of
[1:04:04] God.
[1:04:05] So when you hear the spirit speak to
[1:04:07] you,
[1:04:09] are you obedient to what the spirit is
[1:04:11] telling you?
[1:04:13] Because the spirit knows what we have
[1:04:15] need of.
[1:04:18] We just need to be obedient to the word
[1:04:20] of God
[1:04:22] and then the spirit comes and takes his
[1:04:24] residence in our lives.
[1:04:28] Praise the name of the Lord. Now, as I
[1:04:31] finish in the message, the pagan church
[1:04:34] age
[1:04:37] page 164,
[1:04:42] he says
[1:04:44] remember now, John the Baptist was both
[1:04:47] the prophet and the messenger of his
[1:04:49] day.
[1:04:54] He was filled with the Holy Ghost from
[1:04:56] his mother's womb.
[1:05:00] When he was baptizing in Jordan,
[1:05:03] [Music]
[1:05:05] the word of God,
[1:05:08] Jesus
[1:05:10] came to him.
[1:05:12] The word always comes to the truly
[1:05:15] spiritfilled.
[1:05:19] That is the evidence of being filled
[1:05:21] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:25] That is what Jesus said would be the
[1:05:27] evidence.
[1:05:31] He said, "And I will pray the Father
[1:05:35] that will send you another comforter
[1:05:38] that he may abide with you forever.
[1:05:42] Even the spirit of truth
[1:05:45] whom the world cannot receive.
[1:05:49] Now we know what the truth is.
[1:05:52] Truth is thy word."
[1:05:56] John 17:17.
[1:05:59] And again in John 8:43,
[1:06:03] why do you not understand my speech
[1:06:09] even because you cannot hear my word?
[1:06:15] Did you notice that Jesus said the world
[1:06:18] could not receive the Holy Ghost?
[1:06:24] Well, in this verse,
[1:06:26] I just read
[1:06:29] Neither could they receive the word.
[1:06:34] Why? Because the spirit and the word are
[1:06:37] one.
[1:06:40] And if you have the Holy Spirit
[1:06:44] as the prophets,
[1:06:46] the word would come to you,
[1:06:50] you would receive it
[1:06:52] in John 14:26.
[1:06:55] But the comforter, which is the Holy
[1:06:57] Ghost,
[1:07:00] whom the Father will send in my name,
[1:07:05] he shall teach you all things
[1:07:09] and bring all things to your
[1:07:10] remembrance,
[1:07:13] whatsoever I have said unto you.
[1:07:17] Here again,
[1:07:19] we find the word coming because of the
[1:07:21] spirit of God.
[1:07:24] Again
[1:07:27] in John 16:13
[1:07:32] how when he the spirit of truth
[1:07:36] which is the word is come
[1:07:40] you into all truth.
[1:07:45] And then he said, "Thy word is truth,
[1:07:52] and he he shall not speak of himself,
[1:07:58] but whatsoever he shall hear,
[1:08:01] which is the word of God, that shall he
[1:08:04] speak,
[1:08:06] which is the word, and he will show you
[1:08:09] things to come."
[1:08:12] The spirit brings the word of prophecy.
[1:08:16] Praise the name of our Lord. You see how
[1:08:18] brother Brham is breaking it up
[1:08:22] the spirit of truth
[1:08:26] which is in other words we can say the
[1:08:29] spirit of the word.
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:40] Praise the name of our Lord. The spirit
[1:08:42] of truth.
[1:08:45] which is the spirit of the word
[1:08:49] because the word is God himself.
[1:08:52] It's a living reality.
[1:08:56] You know just like when God said let
[1:08:58] there be
[1:09:01] when he said let there be light
[1:09:05] what happened? Light came forth.
[1:09:10] You know it is the spoken word
[1:09:13] which has life
[1:09:15] and even us like we have come to the
[1:09:17] services of the Lord
[1:09:20] when we hear the word of God.
[1:09:23] The word that we hear
[1:09:26] has the power of God to bring a
[1:09:29] transformation in our lives.
[1:09:32] You only have to hear
[1:09:34] and then obey. Do what the word of God
[1:09:38] is telling you to do.
[1:09:41] And then you'll see the manifestation
[1:09:43] come out.
[1:09:53] You know, to manifest,
[1:09:56] you know, you will see that come out
[1:09:59] when it says, "Let there be a mango
[1:10:01] tree."
[1:10:05] The mango tree came forth.
[1:10:08] It was not something different.
[1:10:11] And now when Jesus told them receive ye
[1:10:14] the spirit,
[1:10:17] the Holy Spirit came.
[1:10:19] Praise the name of our Lord. It should
[1:10:21] be our desire.
[1:10:24] Lord, I desire more of you in my life
[1:10:29] because the Holy Spirit has already been
[1:10:30] given.
[1:10:33] So when it if the Holy Ghost has already
[1:10:35] been given,
[1:10:37] go forward and receive the Holy Spirit.
[1:10:40] How do you receive the Holy Spirit?
[1:10:43] Hear the word. Obey the word. And there
[1:10:46] the Holy Spirit comes
[1:10:49] as the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us not
[1:10:55] look for emotions.
[1:10:56] [Music]
[1:10:59] I felt like this.
[1:11:01] Get your mind away from that.
[1:11:05] Your mind be on the life of Jesus
[1:11:07] Christ.
[1:11:09] Obedience to the word.
[1:11:12] Praise the name of our Lord. You desire
[1:11:14] more of the word of God.
[1:11:16] And the more of the word of God that
[1:11:18] comes to you.
[1:11:21] You are obedient to the word.
[1:11:24] You are living in the word. You are
[1:11:27] manifesting the word. That's the life of
[1:11:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:11:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:11:34] says, I want you to note very carefully
[1:11:37] that Jesus did not say that the evidence
[1:11:39] of being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:41] was speaking in tongues.
[1:11:56] interpreting,
[1:11:58] prophesying
[1:12:00] or shouting and dancing. He said the
[1:12:04] evidence
[1:12:07] would be to be in the truth.
[1:12:14] You would be in the word of God
[1:12:18] for your age.
[1:12:22] evidence has to do with receiving the
[1:12:24] word of God.
[1:12:28] Praise the name of our Lord. So when you
[1:12:30] are looking for the Holy Ghost,
[1:12:33] what do you look for? The word of God.
[1:12:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Just be
[1:12:40] prepared to hear the word.
[1:12:42] And when you hear the word, the word
[1:12:46] himself,
[1:12:48] spoken word
[1:12:50] becomes a living reality in your life.
[1:12:54] You know, Mary told those people at the
[1:12:56] wedding in Cana, Mary told the people at
[1:12:59] the wedding in Cana.
[1:13:04] He told, she told them, "Do what he
[1:13:08] tells you to do."
[1:13:11] And then he told them, "Get this water
[1:13:15] pour in this can power."
[1:13:18] He knew what he was doing.
[1:13:22] And the same thing now.
[1:13:24] Receive the word and the Holy Ghost
[1:13:27] comes down.
[1:13:29] Praise the name of our Lord. It's the
[1:13:31] life of Jesus Christ himself.
[1:13:35] Don't look for jumping up and down.
[1:13:39] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[1:13:42] like when when when brother Brham saw
[1:13:44] that vision
[1:13:47] that the the the garden had wheat and
[1:13:50] tears
[1:13:57] when it was so hot,
[1:14:01] they were all crying to God.
[1:14:04] The tires, all God send the rain.
[1:14:09] They went, "Oh, God, send the rain."
[1:14:14] They were all crying. They were all in
[1:14:17] the same church.
[1:14:19] They were all praying, "Lord, bless us
[1:14:20] with your gifts."
[1:14:24] And now when it started raining,
[1:14:28] they were all rejoicing,
[1:14:31] shouting, jumping up and down.
[1:14:35] So those emotions
[1:14:39] would not prove that this one is now the
[1:14:41] true seed of God.
[1:14:44] They all rejoice after the same
[1:14:45] anointing.
[1:14:48] The way the Bible says they were all
[1:14:50] baptized unto Moses
[1:14:54] when Miriam was singing crossing the Red
[1:14:57] Sea, they were singing in the spirit.
[1:15:03] They were all receiving mana.
[1:15:07] They were all you know drinking of the
[1:15:09] spiritual rock.
[1:15:12] But it is only those who are bold in the
[1:15:15] word.
[1:15:18] They're the ones who are able to make
[1:15:20] it.
[1:15:22] Praise the name of the Lord. So the main
[1:15:24] thing is hearing the word
[1:15:28] and obey that word.
[1:15:31] And then that spirit of God
[1:15:34] that speaks to us the word of God
[1:15:38] will come down in your life
[1:15:41] to give you the power to live the word
[1:15:45] so that the word is manifested in your
[1:15:47] life.
[1:15:49] You know when you see the the garden
[1:15:53] to identify what was false and wrong
[1:15:59] was their fruit.
[1:16:02] The fruit that they bear.
[1:16:05] Not how much they were jumping,
[1:16:08] not how much they were rejoicing,
[1:16:11] not how much they were shouting,
[1:16:15] but where is the life?
[1:16:18] and life will always be manifested by
[1:16:21] the fruit.
[1:16:23] Praise the name of the Lord. And that
[1:16:25] should be our desire.
[1:16:28] Lord, let your life be formed in me.
[1:16:31] Lord, let me become a new creation.
[1:16:35] Lord, be a living reality in me.
[1:16:41] You know when the word says this,
[1:16:44] let me follow the word. Let me be
[1:16:47] obedient to the word. And that's what
[1:16:50] shows whether somebody has the true
[1:16:52] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:57] or he doesn't have you know the Holy
[1:17:00] Spirit can come on your body and you
[1:17:02] feel good
[1:17:04] and you get into the emotions.
[1:17:07] The Holy Spirit can come on your human
[1:17:10] spirit.
[1:17:12] You prophesy.
[1:17:15] You speak in tongues.
[1:17:17] But the baptism we are talking about
[1:17:19] now,
[1:17:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:17:23] true elect
[1:17:27] goes to the soul.
[1:17:30] And in the soul there's no emotion.
[1:17:34] Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[1:17:36] can't prove the emotions as the evidence
[1:17:39] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:44] But once the soul has been quickened by
[1:17:47] the word
[1:17:51] will live in the word and that's what
[1:17:54] brother Brandham is saying
[1:17:57] evidence
[1:17:58] that that person has got the spirit of
[1:18:00] God
[1:18:02] staying in the word.
[1:18:04] can somebody can speak in tongues
[1:18:08] but that's not the proof that the spirit
[1:18:09] of God
[1:18:12] somebody can do all those things
[1:18:15] but the test
[1:18:18] is the word is it living in you
[1:18:22] praise the name of our lord so we should
[1:18:24] desist from going after emotions
[1:18:30] because you can have the emotions and
[1:18:32] you don't have the holy spirit
[1:18:35] But you can't have the life of Jesus
[1:18:37] Christ
[1:18:39] without the Holy Spirit and God.
[1:18:42] And that should be always our desire.
[1:18:46] The way the Bible has told us
[1:18:48] this, the word, you know, the truth
[1:18:52] purifies our soul
[1:18:55] and when they purify our soul, the Holy
[1:18:58] Spirit comes in our soul.
[1:19:01] not stopping on our human spirits.
[1:19:06] Praise the name of our Lord. So what we
[1:19:08] need is God to speak to us.
[1:19:13] Praise the name of our Lord that we can
[1:19:15] be obedient to what the Lord speaks to
[1:19:17] us.
[1:19:20] Praise the name of our Lord. May God
[1:19:22] bless you so much.
[1:19:25] Amen.
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:29] On Sunday we have two services.
[1:19:34] We have brother Andreas who will be
[1:19:35] reaching you on Saturday.
[1:19:40] He's going to preach on Sunday.
[1:19:43] So just keep those meetings in your
[1:19:44] prayers.
[1:19:47] Then they they used to come and help to
[1:19:49] clean the church either on Friday or
[1:19:50] Saturday just make everything
[1:19:53] [Music]

[1:19:57] meetings.
[1:20:00] Praise the name of our Lord. I want us
[1:20:03] to sing a song and each of us can let us
[1:20:05] stand up together.
[1:20:09] Let us sing song 23.
[1:20:12] We must have faith in the word
[1:20:15] that the word can become a living
[1:20:17] reality.
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:22] My faith looks up
[1:20:26] to thee.
[1:20:29] Oh

[1:21:35] heart.

[1:23:19] [Music]
[1:23:22] Amen. Let us sing that song just as I
[1:23:24] am.
[1:23:26] As we prepare to pray
[1:23:29] just

[1:23:39] one plea,
