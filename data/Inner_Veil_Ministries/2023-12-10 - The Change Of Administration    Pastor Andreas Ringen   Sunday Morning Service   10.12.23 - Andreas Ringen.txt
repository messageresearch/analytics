amen amen God bless you let us open let us open our Bibles in the presence of the Lord amen and we want to go to the to the book of uh uh we want to Samuel 2 Samuel we want to open second Sam Samuel and uh this morning 2 Samuel then we want to go to Revelations 22 amen the Lord is good amen second Samuel and in this morning I want to speak on the change of administration a change of administration and being confident with it amen amen okay be aware being being confident with a change of administration amen I believe we are experiencing a great change of administration we see that in the world things are changing and what an administrational change it [Music] is even here in Uganda you are not your own anymore [Music] somebody else takes control amen there's a change of administration and the people are involved in it amen so trust you get the picture in in the spiritual there is a change of administration amen and we must be confident with that change now let's go to 2 Samuel you all know the story of David second Samuel 1 we want to read I think this is a Bible story that we are very familiar with and so but from that Bible story because as we know our Bible and as Believers whatever Branch we come from whatever background we have those Bible stories should be known unto us amen so everybody should really know about David that's why I want to use this Bible story to show the change of administration that taken place in our day amen amen can we say praise the Lord hallelujah you are wonderful people I know you are well taught so you allow me to go into as I would be at home right amen amen second Samuel now at this stage now David is already King David is already King over Judah and over Israel okay at that stage David is already King amen the administrational change had taken place you understand that it was from Saul to David amen amen Again David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel 30,000 and David arose and went with all the people that were with him from Bal and Judah to bring up from hence the AR of God whose name is called by the name of the Lord of host that dwelleth between the kobin [Music] El and they set the Ark of God upon a new card and brought it out of the house of Abad that was in giba and USA and the son of Abad drove the new [Music] C and they brought it out of the house of Abad which was at giba accompanying the Ark of God and a uh went before the [Music] ark s and David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of fire wood and even of harps and on PES and on TRS and on cornets and on [Music] [Music] [Music] symbols okay got it okay okay and David and all the house of Israel played okay we had that and when they came to n stretching floor USA put forth his hand to the Ark of God and took hold of it for the oxen shook [Music] it and the anger of the Lord was kindered against us and God smed him there for his error and there he died by the Ark of [Music] God and David was displeased because the Lord had made a breach upon us and he called the name of the place Paris us to this [Music] day [Music] amen amen just just want to as we stand just want to see the picture what is going on and I trust we have really spiritual uh understanding to see what is going on today amen as I was great change of administration taking place change of leadership change of leadership you understand change of administration and we see here how David how David made a mistake that mistake was because he was not confident and the new Administration and so we have to become very confident in the change of administration that is taking place in our midst has a great change taking place right change of administration amen and then one more scripture Revelation 2217 227 amen hallelujah hallelujah and watch the details how the scripture wonderfully is bringing it out amen Revelation 227 hallelujah hallelujah watch what is spoken watch what is first and the spirit and the bride say come it's not the bride and the spirit but is the spirit and the bride say come and let him that Hearth say come Hallelujah what an Administration now taking place the spirit say come the bride say come and all that hear is say come and let him that is thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely Hallelujah may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his words you can be seated hallelujah hallelujah amen am amen am change of administration amen as we are here and and as we are in I believe we are living in a tremendous time I don't know if we are aware of it as Believers if you would ask the political leaders of every country they cannot be honest in public if the if the leaders of the nations of the countries would be honest how the situation is people would start a war amen that's why by the the leaders of Nations you cannot expect them to tell the truth because people cannot handle the truth anymore sometimes people are complaining that the leaders is not telling the truth but if they would tell you the truth how could handle truth how could handle that amen amen if they really the lead and and we are so far in every leader of every nation we have a leader in [Music] Germany we have our presidents and we have our Governors and if you would really if you would really get them personally and uh they they will tell you a great change is taking place the president of Germany could tell you I have not to say so I'm not the real administrator there's another administrator that stands above me you have seen that in Corona the corona uh uh what was there around the world actually no country decided on their own is that right no country decided on their own you here in Uganda you get a certain support if you would do what somebody else said amen this is what it was remember the president of Tanzania at that time he was he was fighting against certain because he he was a Christian amen and finally he died finally he died because somebody else has to say so you here in Uganda with your government is trying to keep up a certain standard to morality is is that right we had in Germany we had a law from the 1950s that to be a homosexual you had to go to prison it was a law that law was removed a long time ago amen so you understand why was this law removed we still had presidents that believed in that law but there was a greater force behind it it said plainly you have to remove the law amen you you know who standing behind so all leaders they are the leaders of a Nation but in the background somebody else is standing and if you not conform to a certain image they put sanctions on you they put pressure on the Nations amen they put sanctions on the people so finally there's a great change of administration can we believe that there is no place on Earth which we could call Paradise absolutely not you go to the I go to I go to a very far away places I am on the islands in the Pacific you go to a little Island far away in the Pacific just far away they're living some native people but even they cannot hide on their little Islands because this has also reached them it has reached them amen they sometimes they don't have much to eat but they they they have all this amen so you understand they they are under influence anyhow you know how much that influences you you know how much that influences you you know that today in Wars you know they have the saying the first thing that dies in a war is the truth the first thing that dies in a war is the truth because everyone V in media V media bringing out his View to the people you wake up in the morning and on your news there's all kind of news what's going on in Uganda in the world and people trying to influence you their view what is going on is that right so the Bible would say in Revelations 13:8 all that dwell upon the Earth all that dwell upon the Earth if they are in Uganda if they in Germany if they in the Pacific if they on an Islands wherever they are all will worship all will worship finally Satan all whose names were not written in the and we see such an IM immense change of administration taking just a change where where you can see your own home where the husband is actually the head of the home but because of because of all the influences many times other people decide with him you send your children to school which is the normal way that we are living now somebody else is influencing your child somebody else it's just helping you to raise your child is that right so it's an administration of change and you cannot go against it you cannot change it this world sooner or later like the world in the days of Noah it will be destroyed with fire why why because it's a rotten system you cannot go against it have patience and wait till the Lord is doing it amen so there's a change of administration also as we see that in the natural as brother Bram would say and I want I trust you you you understand the message and and uh as brother Ron would say he said it I think in The Sixth Seal maybe I can still read it quickly to remind you brother R said in the six seal brother Ram said about the same time the anti Antichrist moves himself fully on the scene the Antichrist he is the one that is finally controlling the [Music] world is that right the Antichrist finally he's the one that controls the world and and and we don't have to try to excuse that even here in Uganda you are not your own you will find that out very soon when they have to bring laws in that allow homosexuality in Germany not only homosexuality is allowed everything else is allowed they just was discussing a law in the in the parliament just maybe I told you that before but I they debated a law in the Parliament that would allow people to change their [Music] gender as often as they want so that's not a joke grownup men grownup woman debating in the parliament how often people could change their genda so for example I'm I'm a male but I decide tomorrow I want to be a female so I go to the government and tell them from tomorrow you call I want to be called M they changed my passport yes they changed my passport my passport I'm not Ming him Miss is ringing [Music] now so I can do that and if I'm tired next week or next month somebody calling me Ms I can change to be a cat it's not a joke it's not a joke it's it happened in our Parliament so they change my passport I don't know how they call Mr or Mrs I'm then if I'm half year later have year later come I'm tired of somebody calling me cat I have the right to be a [Applause] [Music] tree we love about it and that is the best thing to do but that happened in reality why do they do that become somebody else tell them you have to conform in Germany to a certain standard and don't laugh now that will happen to you also comes there comes a day when your government can hide away from that because behind it as brother Bren would say is the Antichrist that that Satan he shows his dirty being and manifesting and forcing people now to do it for him well listen listen what brother bam said he said he said as the Antichrist and the Antichrist he he is copying the same thing as Christ is doing remember it is the Antichrist it's against Christ amen and he is C in the same system what Christ is doing the Antichrist is like Christ the head of a body and the body is the people come on Church the body of the Antichrist is the people that's why the Bible said All Shall worship Him All Shall worship him we have seen yesterday worship requires a w amen and allow me to say that to make that clear the womb of the Antichrist is the people All Shall worship All Shall worship whose names were not written in the ls of God the whole world will worship him they will be the womb and then brother Bram said he said when the Antichrist spirit moves fully on the scene gods moves fully on the seene what you see in the negative God is doing in the positive it was always like this actually Satan is only copying what God is already doing at the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit fell on the people brother bam says in the same time the Antichrist it was running next to one another every Revival bring forth twins when Jesus was there Judas was there when Cain was there Abel was there is it right they came together abble were born as [Music] twins amen hallelujah hallelujah we just see that we just see that through all the Bible we see it comes as Twins and twins are growing together twins are becoming mature together and what we see now is the Antichrist in its fullness living in the people brother Bram even says it is Satan incarnated not only in one man incarnated in his people Satan incarnated in his people hallelujah hallelujah so is Christ now Christ now Christ now God coming into full view Christ incarnated in his people it is finally Christ walking in them they are not only influenced by the Holy Ghost not only anointed by the Holy Ghost but literally it is Christ the person of the Holy Ghost walking in your [Applause] flesh your living in your being living in your hands it is literally God himself becoming flesh that's right what a change of administration we what we see in the Nations what we see in the world don't hide away in your Hut understand don't run away and hide yourself face the situation because no Hut you can hide in there's no hole you can jump into don't be like an ostrich you know know what he does he puts his he puts his hand in the S not realizing that the biggest part of his body it's still outside canot we have to face those things don't excuse yourself you just come from Uganda don't excuse yourself that you are too simple don't excuse yourself that you are too young don't excuse yourself who you are there is a maturity that is taking place right now there's a change of administration that is taking place today and we have to face that reality this is what Christ is doing today where is Christ today where is he today where is he do you believe he's here at that day at that day which is this day you shall know that I in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah this is more than the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is more than just to be baptized with the Holy Ghost as Paul would say the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the down payment did he say that it's a down payment and all of you know when you have the down payments you still need the rest amen and the down payment is only a part of the price it's not the full price but now he himself came the full price came this is why brother Ram could say the baptism of the Holy Ghost do we agree that we need justification we need justification do we agree we need sanctification without Holiness nobody can see God don't allow Satan to delude sanctification [Music] don't delute justification amen don't delude that with your own Works Martin Luther said the just shall live by faith don't delute that don't let a cath don't let a Catholic Spirit come in that to try to earn your salvation amen you cannot earn you cannot earn your good works is an appreciation for what God has done for you not what he will do for you you cannot make God love you more if you from Tomorrow only fasting and praying to the end of your life God don't love you more amen he loved you when you were in sin and his love for you increasing and cannot [Applause] decrease because his love is elective so whatever you do however you serve the Lord we should do it because we love him because we know what he has done for us amen so we should not dilute water down water down never water down sanctification we should never dilute water down baptism of the Holy [Music] Ghost amen but as the prophet would say justification for sanctification and everybody can say Amen way for sanctification sanctification without you being Sanctified sorry you get me better now sanctify sanctification makes the way for the Holy Ghost to come because he cannot fill a dirty vessel he cannot fill a dirty vessel that's how brother could say and he cannot really stify oh I trust you get that first is justification and justification real justification makes a way for sanctification real sanctification and I want to tell you don't try to perfect your body sanctification is not trying to perfect your flesh you cannot perfect your body that's why he [Music] died if you could perfect your body he died he died in vain so you understand what real sanctification is and justification get that church justification makes way for real sanctification hallelujah hallelujah how many people we have today on Earth they live in monasteries they live in monasteries they never go in the world they spent their whole life behind walls is it right trying to get away not be influenced by the world living a Sanctified life and at the end of their Road it helps them [Applause] nothing because they don't see justification they are trying to earn with their lifestyle to earn eternal life who is their lifestyle you cannot earn eternal life with your lifestyle eternal life is granted to you on the basis of God's Sovereign Grace Jacob have I loved Jacob have I love have I hated hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so you see as brother B was placing it justification made a way for sanctification hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it just opens up to me oh we need justification true justification to really be real Sanctified if really sanctified then it makes a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother bam says the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes the way now for the Holy Ghost to come himself down in Perfection and that is a change of administration that is a change of administration that we are speaking of this morning there took place a change of administration the baptism of the Holy Ghost prepared the way for a new administrator for the Holy Ghost himself amen hallelujah hallelujah as we see in the as we see with uh with David I don't know if you if you watched that how the whole story started amen how the whole story started oh my oh my oh my my my amen here uh here uh it started actually with the coming of a prophet David's kingship began with the coming of the prophet amen amen is that right hallelujah hallelujah oh I trust we watch that very carefully and you understand so from a young boy's life David became familiar confident with that spiritual administrator his name was Samuel Samu he was the one that came to Bethlehem he was the one anointing David is that right it was Samuel the prophet so David was not anointing himself but he was anointed by a prophet he was anointed by a messenger came with the message that God is changing Administration he already said at that day when David was anointed the spirit left s and the Spirit came on David is that right is that right and amazing how David behaved you know why David behaved why he behaved hallelujah hallelujah you know why he could stay humble because he had an administrator his name was Samuel that make him to be [Applause] humble praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah so we need an administrator we agree we need an administrator yes I can say without a prophet we will never make it hallelujah hallelujah amen am can we agree on that it was a prophet came to the house of Jesse that brought the change God did not hand Haden Special Angel he used the prophet for that and David became conf confident with that administrator hallelujah hallelujah amen is an administrator amen but you know something happened that administrator died Samuel died Sam is it right come on Church Samuel died the one that David was confident in that maybe even from time to time would counsel him he died amen amen amen amen but you understand God has a plan and you cannot tell God why did Samuel die just at the time when David needed him the most I tell you church as brother BR died the whole church the whole message round they asked themselves the question why did Brother Brenham amen why did God allow to take him away nobody understood it but the prophet already had told them as Jesus had told the disciples long time before his departing Jesus had told the disci because of you I have to go it is expedient for you that I go because if I don't go the Holy Ghost will not come change of administration that for sure there would be no one in the upper room I would not go in the upper room Jesus would be present no need is that right you remember the story of the feeding of the 5,000 Jesus and his disciples his disciples told Jesus you have preached a little bit too long today the people are angry let them quickly go it becomes late transport is difficult they need food let them go that they can buy Foods you know what Jesus says no no no no no don't let them go it's too late for going the shops have already closed so they don't need to go make them sit and as soon as Jesus said makes them sit the discip it's new something is going on something is good is going to happen is it right because we know when he speaks we know something good is about to happen if he speaks this morning if he speaks this morning we know exactly something's good is going to happen is that right and I believe the disciples was excited they talked about one another have you heard what he said we shall make them s oh my goodness you can expect the great thing and you know what you know what Jesus told them you know what Jesus told them you give them to eat is that right this is what Jesus said now the disciples said what do we [Music] have a few fish 5,000 you know why they stopped going on because Jesus was there he had told he had told them and believe me this morning the same Lord is here and he has a message for you Administration has changed say hallelujah hallelujah Administration has changed allow me it is changing actually they should have started at least one let's take what we have and let's start Jesus told them you feed them but because of Jesus was there it never fell into their heart it fell into their head and then they said no he can do it much better than we come on church amen that's why Jesus said it is necessary for you that I go Hallelujah come on church if he would not go a new dispensation would not have [Music] started if the son of if the son of man did not make way the Son of God [Music] dispensation could not come wake up Church in the last day it is Promised before he will be son of David to the Jews amen after Son of God [Music] dispensation it is promised that he will reveal him himself again a son of man is that right so that son of man dispensation is coming fully in it means Son of God [Music] dispensation Fade Out you're with me hallelujah hallelujah no no no no no the Holy Ghost is not gone it comes in a more extensive way now the entire Holy Ghost not just a dip not just a bit did Martin Luther had the Holy Ghost did Martin Luther had the Holy Ghost did he had the same Holy Ghost you have there's no two holy spirits but he had it in a measure that's why he could drink and smoke and everything he h it in a measure but you have promised to haveit in fullness all all that God was he poured into Christ oh can we say that together that God was where is it today in the church and even brother brandham said in the individual amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so what the change of administration that we are living in what a change of administration as brother brandham would say in the message leadership just want to go slowly into that subject because it's a change of administration as it was in David's time right the change of administration and the change of administrator and as Samuel died want you to get that Samuel dies God had another one is that right God had another one I can give him even a name his name was [Music] Nathan but David was not confident in the new Prophet that's why he get distracted and he listened to the multitudes he listened to the captains because he was not confident in the new administrator amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so we should not get our confidence because we are many we should not be confident today because you have a big group of people because the Bible says fear not little flock amen so our confidence should not be how big our church is our confidence should be in him hallelujah hallelujah in him should be our confidence that we are confident we say administrator what you if you read the story um as we read 2 Samuel chapter 6 so David never consulted uh Na very simple because he was not confident and Samuel was not there anymore God had taken in the Hallelujah God had taken Samuel can we say praise the lord we see how God is doing things and we should learn so as as SC is taken away William Branham 60 years ago there was a new administrator already [Music] present because brother brandham introduced him yeah yes it was the prophet who told us I must decrease he must increas is that right who is he who is he who is he it was not the son of man Son of God dispensation it was not the Son of God dispensation now he was introducing the son of man dispensation amen can we say praise the Lord amen so that people become confident he said it is him it is our Lord up there hallelujah hallelujah do we get the picture the change of administration that happened in our day I ask you the question are you confident are you confident with the new administrator do you see him in that [Music] message hallelujah hallelujah there's not a new message coming there's not a new man coming there's not a eight messenger coming Christ himself the words the words unveiling himself oh I trust you to see what we have in our hands Hallelujah I trust you see what we have in our hands that is the old Administration and that is the new Administration hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah amen amen when you go to 2 Samuel chapter 7 maybe bring that quickly up it's very [Music] interesting if you go to second Samuel Samuel chapter 7 [Music] you can see that David learned David learned from his mistake and we should learn from our mistakes Hallelujah we should learn from something that is not working when David saw a dead person coming out of that he understood something is wrong David understood I counseled the wrong people yes I asked the wrong people because David said it's impossible when God is in it that we have dead people among us come on church is this movement there's no debt allowed amen David understood when Dad is here I did something wrong when that is here David understood something is wrong amen amen let me say to you when spiritual death is in natural death is not so important spiritual death is much more important today if you have SE spiritual de people with this message you know something is wrong amen you know something is wrong and we should understand this message this message cannot produce spiritual death this message is [Applause] life I trust you get that where we are going so David understood in that time it was natural death David understood that cannot be today is spiritual death today is spiritual death and it cannot be that he is here and people are dying spiritually people are dying spiritually with this message we have not we have not seen the new Administration we just take it from William Bram but we have to take it this message doesn't come from William Brenham this message comes from almighty God it was sent from the father a father William Bram William Bram was only a tool like elazar was a toour but it was Abraham sending forth a message was Abraham the father Abraham the father sending force a message to elazar as brother Bram hallelujah hallelujah brother Bram was not the Holy Ghost brother BR was not the son of man brother Brenham was just like El getting a message from the father you go out you go out and look for a bright you don't make a bright you don't create a bright you just look for a bride Ela said how shall I do it what did Abraham say the Lord will sent his Angel his Angel before for you and his Angel what is his Angel the angel of the Lord speaks of the Lord [Music] himself hallelujah hallelujah so actually Abraham said the Lord will go himself you're with me the Lord will come himself the Lord himself shall descend is that right so it was not elazer making himself a bride trying to look somewhere in the place or she looks it was not elazar amen elazar was not the bridegroom Ela is not the bridegroom it was the father understand that it is again the father is the father sending a message this message comes from God hallelujah hallelujah can we believe that hallelujah hallelujah and here elasa watch now very close how elasa was doing to find a bride he came the father told him the father told him go to to denomination don't go to denomination don't go to that place don't go to that place don't go to that place go to a certain kind of people go to a certain kind of people and then brother Bram said the angel of the Lord Lord was a half hour before elator arrived the angel of the Lord arrived so before before El came Hallelujah before the messenger came God was on the scene so it was not actually a is looking it was God [Music] preparing hallelujah hallelujah and then elaz came to the place and you remember how he prayed remember how he prayed he said Lord let the first damel the first damel that comes out and that I ask for a drink of water and that and she that shall be a sign that shall be the sign that shall be the sign that this is the bride she has to do something without me telling her it has to be God himself dealing with Rebecca you're with me so you are not following just a man yet in the beginning you follow a man that's why Rebecca said I Will Follow That Man remember in the Tabernacle if you go from from the outer Court into the holy place to come into the holiest of holies you have to cross Badger skins Come Again Come Again you have to cross Bader skins you're with me because between the holy place and the holies of holies there was a veil of humanity bger skins Bader skins God has orchestrated that so you have to come to that Badger skin in order to go into the holy is that right yes yes but you never stop with the Bader skins if you come to the badges skins you cannot say I'm there coming to Eleazar Rebecca could not say I'm there said no I'm not the bright group I'm just the veil you with me but once if you can break through the veil of humanity you see who wel Brenham really was because the badger skin is failing the Hol of holies from the outside not only with brandham not only with the messengers that's the same with you you bger skin your flesh is veiling who you really are can you understand that we are not going into the holies of holies just we are a part of the holiest of [Applause] holiest hallelujah hallelujah change of administration is happening come on Church wake up what a change of administration hallelujah hallelujah amen and he was eleazer outside praying now Rebecca came out she was the first damsel or maybe she was not even the first maybe she was the first but he asked the question let the first stel that comes out and which I asked to drink and then she gives me to drink and then she will feed the camels but I will not tell her that will be the sign so elaz said this is not my choice it must be the Lord and as Rebecca came out I believe she was also the first but even if she would be the second imaginea would ask the first give can you give me to drink and the one said yes you look like a very you thirsty person I will give you to drink thank you very much okay God bless you knew that's not the bride but now Rebecca comes out maybe she was the first one yes but just not really in numbers the first one but she was the first one that he asked for a drink and as he asked for a drink she said she said I will not only give you but you canel also look very thirsty I will also feed your camel and as she said that he said praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen you understand that behind everything was the [Music] father Abraham Abraham was guilty of that Abraham was guilty of that all and now she's asked the question you understand when I say that amen God is behind that all Hallelujah [Applause] oh my my we could stop here but then we don't finish what we want to do come on chur so the sign of being the bride was asking an extra work to feed the animals those those animals would bring her finally [Music] back so you are not saying Amen to the minister you are not saying Amen to the messenger you're not saying just Amen to William branon was not just saying Amen to William Brandon right was saying Amen to the Holy Ghost [Music] himself that's why as she said this is nothing but the truth she did not say it just to William Brandon she said it to the one that was higher than William BR that's why there's a higher authority present who told the prophets tell her whatever she asked you understand that William Brandon was not the administrator he was the administrator the mighty one was the administrator yes trust we get that brother Brandon could not say whatever you want it was he himself said whatever she was give it [Music] her can we see the new Administration right being a part of it hallelujah hallelujah the bride being a part of it it was was not the administrator speaking it was not the administrator speaking to the sons of hetti right it was not the administrator speaking to the squirrels it was William brandham speaking to the squirrel is that right you get the picture amen watch it now very carefully that is the new Administration we have to become confident in amen hallelujah hallelujah amen as Rebecca became confident in and her first step of becoming confident is to follow that man hallelujah hallelujah so the first step to become confident for us in this new Administration is if we follow William brandham Don't Be Afraid Rebecca was not be afraid her her denominational ask her the question do you want to follow that [Music] man because they did not understand what was behind it they didn't understand so that's why they asked do you want to follow that man and she couldn't say I follow the holy spirit because those people no idea of nothing that's why she was not afraid to say I follow that man you should not be you should not be afraid to say I follow that man William brand knowing where he will bring you to I had no problems I had no problems to follow brother Steven to come to this place I had no problems to sit in his car resting because I know he knows the way and I know I could not be here unless but as I arrived here I would not follow him you understand that I didn't push him on the ppose and say tell me what to say because he brought me to the place where I supposed to be this morning Hallelujah and Med four William Bram is the only one that can bring you to your place of perfection your place of perfection your place of perfection it's your position your position under the new administrator which is Isaac himself which is Isaac himself Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and as she were following the man on the camels that she haded [Music] CH can we make it more plain what is going on today that's why you amen it's not to make the pastor happy amen it's not just the visiting Minister can say this church is alive your amen is to him who is present he wants to hear your amen he wants to hear from you I believe that it was not hey right just speaking to brother Brandon this is nothing but the truth what he said the administrator heard brother brother random said as right said that this is nothing but the truth said such a presence came into because it was pleasing unto him Hallelujah it was pleasing unto him not unto William Brandon I'm I'm honest with you had you right was not shouting at brother BR Amen brother she was sitting in the back she was not sitting around the table with the brothers she knew how to behave she knew what her position was she was in the back and maybe even brother brandham was not really hearing that so you you don't have to be a trumpet if you are a trumpet stay a trumpet but don't try to become a trumpet because you feel then God hears me better be what you are be what God made you be real be what you are what you are on the outside be also here if you are a trumpet on the outside too many people have their Church face at home they're always moving and just doing and at church they are spe [Applause] spec what are you doing outside how do you live your life there was a brother I don't I don't know I don't call his name he was a pastor of a church and and he had the impression that many people in his church was not acting the way they normally Act amen amen hallelujah hallelujah if you are at home Happy why you not here happy if you're at home a [Music] Speculator that's fine then maybe be he also one [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] understand so that brother that brother he did for his church he organized a big party you know a big uh Feast with uh with barbecue and all kind of games the children could play not only the children he organized also a play for the adults adult the adults yes you know sometimes what we like some people maybe like to play with a ball at least you at home you do that amen so and he watched his own people he saw the old sisters getting excited making a game and he said uh uh uh uh uh so next Sunday he come back to the church he said I watched you also you old people you say you are too all to react and to praise the Lord and to say amen I watched you get so excited about the game get excited about the word of [Applause] God so what you are be here don't put the church face when you come so if you're not a trumpet outside don't try to be a trumpet if you are a trumpet outside be a trumpet in the [Applause] church this is what brother Ram told us he said be what you are be a Christian you said is that right be a Christian but be what God made [Applause] youu amen amen hallelujah you understand so this is what het was I spoke with people that knew sister hatti from the church that he was going she that right was a part of the Brenham Tabernacle she lost her husband in a very early a stage her husband was killed because a lightning was striking a tractor as far as I know so she was a widow and she had to raise her two kids and because of living many times she could not attend the morning service in the [Music] Tabernacle she only could attend the afternoon service because in the morning she had so much on her scale you understand the background what God [Music] ising God is God is showing regardless what your circumstances are in life come on Church regardless what your circumstances are in your family regardless God wants you in the new [Music] Administration he is showing that through the life of heti right is that right come on Church showing that God wants to use the smallest trumpet in town to be a part of that Administration sister right she was not the Amen Corner in the church she was not because of circumstances many times she could not be in [Music] church oh what a mighty God we serve God is not looking at your circumstances God is not looking at your weakness hallelujah hallelujah what is he looking for he's looking for the seat he's seeing the seat is that right hallelujah hallelujah amen amen Oh My my what a change of administration Place remember watch you right trust it helps you as the prophet told her what God had told the prophet sister what you said was the truth what you said pleased the Lord sister I should tell you whatever you say will happen watch her first reaction said brother Bram what shall I do what shall I say because she was so confident what did brother rham told her he said oh said I don't know maybe you can ask for money you are [Music] poor uhhuh uhuhuh you know if she would been just following William Brandon she would do what he said Hallelujah but she was well thought prth be to God brother ROM never pointed the people to him he always pointed the people to [Music] Christ and she said maybe you can ask for the healing of your sister is it right come on Church why do did right ask him because she was confident in him and then the prophet excuse me to say that was giving her wrong advices you can catch that for it forgive me it was not wrong advises just to test her you get the picture who gets the picture I know I can go that far because you are a Well taugh church amen but it's interesting she was hearing that but then she said my greatest desire is the Salvation of my voice do we get the picture new Administration hallelujah hallelujah are we confident was our new administrator that was veiling himself in a man called William Bram he said no I'm not the son of man I am a son of man revealing [Applause] the as brother brandham would say as long as you are building a wall it's all fine everyone can do that to build a wall but God don't want just a wall to be built he would ask the question what house do you build me hallelujah what house is being built so this God is not building a wall he is orchestrating a house a temple hallelujah hallelujah and the last thing the last thing that comes to finish up the temple is The Headstone hallelujah hallelujah that's the that's one of the quotes yes as long as you are building the wall one straight way it's all fine The Brick Layers can do right down the road but when you have to turn the corner that's where the time and we are not building a wall we are building a house you see these turns has to come they come in the age of Martin Luther John Wesley and the P AG wait and it's here again am do you get him this is not just William brandham speaking this is the one Speaking who is the Builder because God told David you are not building me a house Solomon is not just building me a house but God said to David I will build you a house so God is the Builder of that church oh I'm so happy I can jump from those places am you you watch bring the picture up again because it's very remark amen the quote can you bring it again yes CRA amen so Luther Wesley and the Pentecost L and it is here again so we are turning another Corner when you see when you turn the last corner of a house nothing else is left then the roof to come down Hallelujah nothing else is left so the last Corner that will be turned is not for making another wall but the last turn of the that is made is now for The Headstone to come down that is the last turn of the house if the words are finished have the last turn you see it's finished you see the last turn hallelujah hallelujah the last turn is to look up your Redemption draws now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah then brother R said in birth pains amen he said we are not building a wall start of his Luther's message ly on the Pentecost message we are turning Corners we are building a building and it's a prophet's Age and and they turn those Corners made those different but the builders wanted to build a wall but it is a building the building of God in another quote brother Ram said he said we had those Specialists we had those Specialists Luther specialist Wesley do you believe Luther turned a corner the just shall live by faith absolutely ET then Wesley came another specialist brother the Pentecost is it not amazing watch very carefully that brother said lther Wesley and then Pentecost is it not amazing he said Luther h w h and Pentecostal H you know what the the church age of Martin Luther's name [Music] wasis Wesley was Philadelphia and then we had the Pentecostal age which is the lene age is it not amazing brother said Luther wle Luther was a specialist Wesley was a specialist and then he said Pentecost why is he doing that he had to say BR him is a specialist right because William Martin Luther he was the messenger of the church age and that's why brother said Luther was the specialist Wesley was the messenger to that church age and brother said Wesley was that specialist now when he came to the Pentecost age of the Lan church he had to say William Bram was that specialist but the prophet if he's a true prophet he never puts himself in the picture but it was the last star in the hand of God Adam was the latest edition that [Music] came naming all other species before him so the last angel that was in the hand of God was giv to give names to all the other and when it came to his own name he had to keep silence no prophets no man is projecting [Music] himself can you say Amen to that what's William Bram the messenger to the line churches amen amen now bring that quote again bring the quote again that's because I really want you to get something that we see with a change of administration remember how how David was not confident as you read at home 2 Samuel [Music] 7 it is about the temple worship right Solomon wanted to build a temple actually David he wanted to make a temple is that right amen and then suddenly naan is with David Nathan is actually telling David finally you don't build the temple David God told me to tell you your son Solomon will oh my oh my oh my if we had time we would go into that if David would not be confident by now in the new administrator he would ask again the public and then he would would have probably build a temple you with me but God says you are not the man to build the temple because you have too many blood on your fingers is that right David would have made the next mistake but now he was confident with Nathan now he asked Nathan what shall I do Nan and then God could speak through the new new administrator hallelujah hallelujah and David became a part of that administ trust you can follow message go right down the straet then and anybody can run a straight line but it takes amazing to the corner it takes the power of God to to have to descend it I'm not sure if that is that quote but there okay maybe not here but brother Brenham says we always need a specialist to turn the corner and then brother brandham said Lua was a specialist Pentecost Westley was a specialist and William brandham was a special I can't say that because brother R is not saying is that okay when I say that so will brandham was a specialist but brother rham tells us very clear and we need another one hallelujah hallelujah not speaking of the eight messenger not speaking of the eight messenger but speaking of Christ himself now hallelujah hallelujah amen amen are you just quickly ready for a little look we did it last time already last time I was here and we were seeing how the church ages and the messenger to it and I just failed to go there again so that we become more confident with the new administrator not becoming more confident with William Brandon I trust you are confident with him are you confident with William BR are you ready to follow that man to where where do you want to follow him to where do you want to follow him Rebecca new I follow that man to find Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah are we ready to follow that man because that that man will not lead us to his church that man is the only one yes he's the only one that knew the way to [Music] Isaac can you say praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen maybe you can bring that up you have that that P the drawing because really I want to show you we really went through it and maybe I want to read one or two [Music] quotes just to remind you to get you more [Music] confident with the new administrator hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yes that it will become more than statements of the Prophet as philli would say show us the Father and Jesus could say so long I am with you you don't know me no you are not confident what Jesus you are the father Jesus said no I'm the son yes you understand hallelujah hallelujah so your brain is not becoming confident but your heart confid sorry are you confident within your administrator I am not the new administrator I am a part of the new Administration brother Sten is not new Administration he's a part of new Administration he's a part of the new Administration Willam is not the new ad but he's a part of the Bride he's a part of the Bride that's why he's a part of the new Administration H Wright was not her own administrator but she was a part of the new Administration the church is not her own administrator the church is not the Holy Ghost the church needs the Holy Ghost yet she is heart Administration hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can we say praise the Lord Brother Adam said in the end time messenger you can leave it that's fine you can that's fine he said when God sends a messenger and want to sing that's three statements brother R makes brother said there if God sends a messenger he always comes at the end of the age can you say Amen to that that's a principle it's a principle he never he comes always at the End of the Age always to start a new age is that right you know how it how it's went he opens the truth spiritual war happens amen and the new opens is that right hallelujah hallelujah amen amen then brother Ram said I I I just have to quote see but I think you know you know [Music] them he said the messenger comes always at the end of the former age did you remember last time when I was here we just was just want to remind that maybe it was it was it's it's passing us so the messenger according to brother Bram comes always at the end of the former age we don't have the time so because of the time running out you can go to the first seal page [Music] 114 paragraph 7 to 74 you go to the message countdown 1962 page 16 maybe I will read I try to find this one and I will read it to you and then you can you can go to to another quote to end time messenger preached preach let me quickly see and get you the 13 16th of January 1963 amen let me read to you from the message countdown and remember the messenger comes at the end of the former message [Music] always amen amen at the end of the former and as we have seen that here as you know the church ages I just did is this picture known to you maybe we shown it last time also but this is actually uh the years till 2023 that we are living in now from the year we call it zero that started with Jesus okay and then we have 10 after 33 years Jesus died okay you see that and then we go down 53 and go down to this age and here we have then we have here all the messengers we have Paul arus Martin colba Luther Wesley and we could put in Bram is that right okay and then we also see the ages how long the church age was Ephesus was 117 140 296 tyara was 914 in the last Church age in 2023 it has to same length as the first church age 2023 makes ludia the same the same length at Ephesus and if brother Brandon would say the last Church age will be a very short one amen amen and 2023 it is not the shortest it is on the same line like Ephesus was you know how late we are you know how late we are we are later than we think church laia is running out what is ushering in brother Ram called it another age is ushering in he said it Eternal age he called it the Eternal age he also called it the bright age he called it the abrahamic age hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah so let L this year continue be sure that you are not in lodia [Applause] anymore amen just quickly we come in a few minutes we come we close speaking of the new administrator and being confident with the new Administration I want to ask you how confident are we was William Bron do we believe him are we ready to say we follow that man because we know where he leads us to he leads us to the second Adam the entire Holy Ghost the son of man Christ himself the bridegroom intelligence Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the heads Hallelujah quickly go through it um to show plainly that Paul did not came at the end of Ephesus I want to let really let that sink now Paul did not came the end of Ephesus yet he was the messenger to the church age of Ephesus is that right I also showed you this Paul was born in 10 after the birth of Christ and he died in 67 ad you can you can find it out that's what the historical is Paul was born one day like you and Paul died one day so he was born in 10 ad and he died in 67 ad and he didn't came at the end of Ephesus amen amen we let that sink brother said Luther came end at the end of the Jewish dispensation Paul Paul Paul came at the end of the Jewish [Music] time you're with me see the principle that will help you to be more confident is what this message really is this message is not a message of William brandham this message is the message of God this is not the unveiling of William Brandon this is the unveiling of God Christ is the mystery of God revealed what was the mystery behind Christ what was his mystery his mystery was that he was God he was unveiling God is that right so Christ was the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ was God the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed what is the mystery of the Bride of the bright is God hallelujah hallelujah because head and body Hallelujah according to scripture the one that sanctifies and the one that are Sanctified are of the same at scripture Paul is tell I think Paul is telling us this the one that sanctifies which is Christ and the one that are Sanctified that's me are all of God so the mystery behind Christ was God and the Mystery behind the church is God again hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can we say praise the Lord just to I do that so we become confident with a new administrator because if we become confident like David became confident with na that helped him in his life in his [Music] administration hallelujah hallelujah sorry when I get excited I so confident in who William Brandon was I'm so confident I can read the message and there's no mistake in this [Music] message you might say brother Andrew you are brainwashed your your brainwashed and I would say yes my brain is washed By the Waters of the world [Laughter] so now I can think straight there is no mistake in this message there is no mistake in this message hallelujah hallelujah I'm totally confident with that hallelujah hallelujah I know who William Brandon was don't tell me about brother brandham what I know better people try to tell today brother Brandon make here a mistake mistake mistake don't tell me I know him better if you want to tell me today all the mistakes my wife has you come too late you come too [Music] late you come too late I will not divorce my wife because of what you are telling me I will never divorce I will never divorce from the confidence I have in that man because I know him too good I know his purpose I know what he was sent for you see the difference I'm speaking now to matur people [Applause] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah follow follow that line so Paul came at the end of the Jewish dispensation to start the church age of Ephesus at the end of Ephesus irus came irus came at the end of Ephesus to start the church age of SMA you can plainly see his day when he was born his day when he died Martin Martin came what Martin he was the messenger of pergam Amen is that right and he came at the end [Music] of born in 315 ended then he came as a m to that church age lifted up a little bit you see he died 400 ad and the church age ended 606 ad then colba came and I told you last time colba is the most exciting one you're still you're still somebody remembers it may be good that we refresh that little bit just to do that so you can be confident in who is present because William Bram died for the one that is present the new administrator he's Eternal he cannot die hallelujah hallelujah our new administrator can die because he's Eternal and if he is eternal we are [Applause] Eternal colba makes it very nice Cola actually comes colba is born when pergamon is in the middle of its of its length so Cola the messenger to Ty Tyra doesn't come at the end of Ty Tyra but he comes at the end of P you're with me you see the you see the the types always running in line always same God sent a messenger always at the end of the former age always is that right and like I said to you last time colba he died 597 you can prove historical this is what it is did Brother bam die did he di in 1965 he died 1965 you can stand on your heads you can stand on your head you might deny it he still died 1965 when was brother bham born 1909 is that right if you like it or not that's was he was born just do that God makes no mistakes he's running in his types and as we say as we understand the principles we understand the doctrine of it amen what God always is doing amen you're with me okay just to make we said I'm closing then we come to the last one col study it out find it out yourself colba lived not one day in that church age that he was Messenger to he was born before and he died before his church age started and yet God made him the messenger for that church age isn't that amazing hallelujah hallelujah now we come to the last Church age L year when did Brother Bram came when did he came he didn't came at the end of laia he came at the end of Philadelphia Philadelphia ended 1906 1909 the prophet was born so he came at the end of the church age of Philadelphia to start the church age of ludia and he became the messenger to the church age to the Pentecostal Church age is it is it right is it right yes and it was promised there should come somebody the end of [Music] laia is it right is it correct amen that's why you can see in the ministry of William brandham decreasing he told us I must decrease and now he inre actually brother B said the real Messenger to the church age is the Holy Ghost is that right is that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just making us more aware after the death of the Prophet who is present now with [Music] us hallelujah hallelujah are we confident are we confident with the change of administration are we Confident come on Church what really this message is this message is not only William brandham this message is the son of man as brother Brandon would say I am a son of man revealing the son I can ask you now today who is present amongst us who is our administrator now you understand hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can we say praise the Lord that's why brother Ram said Church age book true bride will be under her messenger the final voice to the final age hallelujah hallelujah what treasure do we have this is not William branham's opinion this is God's opinion is that okay when I say that brother bam had so many Ministries that was declared in his life and all those Ministries you find in the message yes that's why sometimes people get confused that brother bham said this here and they're there and they call it a mistake no it is not a mistake it is different Ministries it's not a mistake you know John the Baptist was brother Ram also of the Forerunner like John the Baptist so he had the ministry of John the Baptist you know how John the Baptist get confused you know how John the Baptist confused at the end of his life because he had only one ministry that's why brother Bam could not get confused because he had more Ministries to be and he the Moses Ministry come out of her my people come out of denomination Moses called Israel out is this do we find that in that message [Music] come on can I speak to mature people that knows how to read that is not getting confused brother said this here why is he saying and then and then critics then critics come in you see he made a mistake there he made a mistake here he said this here and that here he's confused no they are confused because they don't understand who was here in this hour brother Brandon wanted to be an Elijah of the Old Testament what did the Lord told him what did the told him you are much more than an Old Testament Prophet is that right hallelujah hallelujah total confidence in this message because I know how to [Music] read you remember the story of a man he was so excited about the message or so excited about the Bible so excited about the message and he went went to his boss and he said boss you must read this read it the Bible the message is so wonderful so the boss said okay give it to me I read so after a week the boss came back to the worker you can have it back why boss I was reading it he was always calling me Buzzard Buzz Buzzard the brother said strange I read the same book and he's calling me Eagle all the time how do we read how readest [Applause] thou how hearest [Music] thou hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah this is what this message is that's why brother Ram did not get confused he had the potentials to be confused yes you see in his life he had the potentials to be confused like John the Baptist hello face realities many of you me I have potentials to be confused I know my history I know my family tree I know there's some some things in my family tree that could cause me to be confused but I cannot be confused you know why not because I have a different Ministry that's why the brides cannot fall yet she has the potential of falling but she cannot fall because she has a Ministry hallelujah hallelujah she has a Ministry she is a part of the administration hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yes no William Bram had the ministry of Moses he opened his Bible several times Joshua so he had the ministry not only to bring the people out he had also the ministry to bring the people in is that right but I ask you how do you read you can read Moses ministry here do very simple open your Bible and go to the Genesis do it at home and there God speaking to Noah Noah finished I destroy the world you go and build a boat you can read that today and you know it's the end of days why don't you build a boat how do you read there's a man in Holland today a man in Holland today he's not a message believer just the denomination Christian and he is he is building a Big Arc spending millions of Euros to build a boat because it is scripture how do we read how do we read a guy he will burn in his [Music] ark can we say praise the Lord how do we read are you confident this message becomes more precious every day to me when I started 30 years I had the same BX and I started 30 years I Mark the same books and they carry them now 30 years and they never get old it never get old it becomes more precious every day I read because I'm confident was the administrator I never I never have met William Bram but I met the the god of William [Applause] Brandon I want to close with that quote not with a quote which you statement out of Jewish books you know remember how the Bible speaks of the book of Yasha Yoshua no no not Joshua jasha yesha uh-huh study it at home the book of jasha is not in the Bible it's not in the Bible but the Bible speaks of the book of you you study your Bible you love the Bible you read it the Bible said as it is written in the book of Yasha but Yasha is not a part of the Bible hello we understand books would not be enough to catch all that Jesus has said is that right hallelujah hallelujah so I hope you don't mind when I read to you out of a Jewish book and don't take it as us say the Lord take it as an encouragement take it as an is that okay it's so close to the Bible it's so close to the Bible it was in the 10th month of the seventh year of the reign of the king Aeros you can find it in the Book of Esther 10th month of the seventh year 10 it's in Esther chapter 2 in the 10th month of the seventh year of the Reign something happened in the Kingdom ofos you all heard the name Vash was kicked out you know why you know why because she refused to unveil more beauty of the king you know why denominations is kicked out because they refusing God the womb yes they're refusing God their womb they rather give their womb to Satan they refuse again it quot quot Hallelujah they refuse God to have more quote brother Bron spiritual sexual relationship with them to bring forth children of this age what are you bringing forth Church do we bring forth children of [Music] laia how do we bring forth children of this age prise God hallelujah hallelujah at the end at the 10th month of the seventh year hallelujah hallelujah Administration was changing the king needed another queen that right and here we see hay the type of the Prophet telling Esther what it needs to become bright that time Esther is chosen to be the queen but she is not confident with her new administrator [Music] she don't know the king yet do you know why Eve is Fallen because Eve didn't know Adam very [Music] well she was not confident with Adam if she would be confident she could wait if you are confident Hallelujah say that wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength but you can only wait if you are confident and Esther was not confident she was not confident and then we see mukai the type of the Holy Spirit moving into the church today the holy spirit is moving into the church speaking to you Esther it is high time for a purpose you are not called to be silent in the room you're called for a purpose Esther said to Mory what shall I do Mor what shall I do King has not asked me to come nobody can go to the king because there's a law 30 days nobody can come to the king modai said to Esther don't forget who you are and then Esther was praying for Revelation this is what brother random said this is what the church should pray for more than before our daily Foods more than for anything else we should pray for Revelation because revelation is the greatest overcoming power that can be given to you you overcome the
