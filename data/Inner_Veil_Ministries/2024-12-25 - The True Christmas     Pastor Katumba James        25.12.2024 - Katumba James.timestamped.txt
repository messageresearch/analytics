[49:13] informed that we can know how many
[49:15] people are going to those meetings from
[49:18] chise the name of our so let us go to
[49:22] Luke Chapter
[49:24] 2 and then verse one
[49:28] and it came to pass in those days that
[49:31] there went out a decree from Cesar
[49:33] Augustus that all the world should be
[49:48] taxed and this taxing was first made
[49:51] when sarus was governor of Syria
[50:02] and all went to be tax everyone into his
[50:05] own
[50:11] City and Joseph also went up From
[50:14] Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into
[50:17] Judea andto the city of David which is
[50:19] called bethleem because he was of the
[50:22] house and lineage of David
[50:43] to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife
[50:46] being great with the
[50:53] child and so it was that while they were
[50:57] there the days were accomplished that
[50:59] she should be
[51:07] delivered and she brought forth her
[51:09] firstborn son and wbed him in the swling
[51:12] clothes and laid him in the manger
[51:16] because there was no room for them in
[51:18] the Inn
[51:35] let us pray father we thank you for the
[51:38] reading of the
[51:39] word we pray that the Holy
[51:42] Spirit may come and give us
[51:45] understanding in your
[51:46] word that that will encourage us and
[51:51] guide us in the path that still lays
[51:52] ahead of
[51:54] us may speak to us in such a speci Lord
[51:57] and bless everyone of us Lord and meet
[52:00] all our needs Lord For the Glory of your
[52:03] holy name in the name of Jesus Christ
[52:06] ask this amen you may be
[52:10] seated so I just want to take some
[52:13] time and talk about the true
[52:17] Christmas praise the name of our Lord
[52:20] the true Christmas Christmas and we see
[52:24] that the
[52:25] world takes 25th December as the
[52:30] Christmas but when you go back in the
[52:33] reality of
[52:35] it Christ was not born on 25th
[52:39] December praise the name of our Lord but
[52:41] the world takes it like
[52:43] that
[52:45] because some crafted it that
[52:48] way
[52:50] now Christ was born as a lamb
[52:57] praise the name of the Lord and in
[52:59] Palestine
[53:02] now it's
[53:06] winter and it has been winter even
[53:09] before so the animals are not in the
[53:13] field but they they in the house they
[53:17] are not on the Hills
[53:20] grazing they are inside the house
[53:23] because it is very cold
[53:27] and sometimes could even
[53:30] snow so they cannot be out
[53:33] there and then when you read in the
[53:35] scriptures
[53:36] here in Luke chap
[53:39] 2 the Bible
[53:41] says let us go to Luke Chapter 2 and
[53:44] then verse
[53:47] 8 and they were in the same country
[53:50] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[53:54] watch over their flock by night
[54:05] so the Sheep were in the
[54:08] field the Shepherds were in the
[54:14] field in Winter you can't get such a
[54:18] thing so you see that the season and the
[54:21] time they are not right according to the
[54:22] scripture
[54:26] praise the name of the sheep are always
[54:29] out
[54:31] there during the Spring Time when the
[54:34] weather is somehow
[54:38] warm praise the name of that's when they
[54:41] out
[54:42] there but you know when it is called
[54:45] they in the
[54:48] houses praise the name of our now in the
[54:52] message God's Gift always find their
[54:54] places
[54:58] but it really should
[55:00] be it says it should be teaching their
[55:03] children what real Christmas
[55:08] is and I totally do not
[55:11] believe that Christ could be born on
[55:14] 25th day of December in
[55:18] Judea because it is CER than it is here
[55:24] now how could Shepherds be keeping their
[55:27] flock by
[55:30] night and then the Taxation and
[55:33] everything and Mary having to come that
[55:39] far from way down in bethem up to
[55:45] Juda up into Jus for
[55:49] taxation I hardly could believe
[55:52] that you know even the timing of
[55:55] movement is not
[55:58] because these people didn't have cars at
[55:59] that time they were either using
[56:03] horses or
[56:05] Caravans you know where they get some
[56:08] kind of thing and then they
[56:11] move and you know Nazareth and
[56:17] Bethlehem Nazareth and Bethlehem is a
[56:20] long
[56:23] distance praise the name of the Lord so
[56:25] now the season was not
[56:28] right you know like the scripture says
[56:32] pray that your
[56:34] flight is not in the
[56:37] winter or on the Sabbath day because
[56:40] winter was a hard time to
[56:43] travel how could the how could the the
[56:47] emperor say go for taxation when he
[56:50] knows it is difficult to move
[56:56] so you see that they don't rhyme
[56:58] together then he says I believe okay how
[57:03] could that
[57:05] be it could not be done but I believe
[57:08] that Christ was born in a
[57:14] spring because in every way he was a
[57:19] lamb you notice he was born in a barn
[57:22] and not in a house
[57:26] the name of now the world puts a day one
[57:31] day in
[57:33] a and you know everybody
[57:36] jubilates you know it's just like a
[57:38] storm
[57:40] coming every person was
[57:46] living so the storm comes and throws you
[57:48] maybe
[57:50] to now after that one day of Christmas
[57:53] again another stor comes and choices
[57:55] from G
[57:59] and the words about
[58:01] business the music industry
[58:05] Entertain You Know clothing industry
[58:09] everything and even those who are
[58:11] selling
[58:12] food
[58:14] all but the food is the same food we
[58:18] eat praise the name of our it's just
[58:23] business and then some people
[58:26] they see Christmas as the only day they
[58:28] go to
[58:30] church and as we were traveling we got
[58:32] many people coming out of church or
[58:34] entering
[58:37] church and in some of the
[58:39] churches if the the preacher delays to
[58:43] finish the
[58:45] sermon then they
[58:47] [Music]
[58:54] start it's about
[58:59] fting and then in some
[59:02] Churches when the minister is
[59:05] preaching then a lady
[59:07] comes from behind
[59:10] ENT and then he just
[59:13] [Music]
[59:15] makes she would want show the phone
[59:17] she's
[59:18] having the hand she's having how the
[59:22] hair is made then she comes and
[59:25] sits everybody's eyes are
[59:27] turning and then say maybe the hair is
[59:30] for
[59:32] 50,000 that b it was
[59:35] 100,000 that CL is about this much then
[59:39] the
[59:41] shoes and and that's the mindset of the
[59:45] people and then some when she has just
[59:48] sat when she has
[59:50] just she Lees the phone
[59:54] on everybody turns
[59:58] then she goes
[1:00:00] out and all the people's eyes are there
[1:00:03] go there for
[1:00:05] display not to worship
[1:00:08] God praise the name of our and then on
[1:00:11] these
[1:00:12] days these religious
[1:00:16] systems they want to make a lot of
[1:00:19] money
[1:00:21] gift oh we are selling this we are doing
[1:00:24] this announc the annual
[1:00:27] program and then those who live in
[1:00:29] Campland have come to the
[1:00:31] Village they want to show that they can
[1:00:33] contribute a
[1:00:35] lot me I'm contributing 1 million I'm
[1:00:38] contributing
[1:00:40] this you know so it is not the genuine
[1:00:45] worship they don't have the
[1:00:47] Christmas they have been given a fake
[1:00:52] Christmas so we need to find out what is
[1:00:55] the true Christmas
[1:00:58] praise the name what was the reason for
[1:01:01] Christ
[1:01:03] coming why was Christ born because if we
[1:01:08] don't get to know why Christ was
[1:01:11] born we also perish like the rest of the
[1:01:14] world they are in
[1:01:17] wickedness they are in all forms of
[1:01:20] evils you know a lot of wickedness done
[1:01:23] in this
[1:01:24] season may be more than what is done the
[1:01:27] rest of
[1:01:29] [Music]
[1:01:33] there even
[1:01:35] businessmen most of them make the profit
[1:01:37] at this
[1:01:38] season and then that profet can take
[1:01:41] them through the time when they are not
[1:01:42] making
[1:01:44] prophets and so Satan gets the the the
[1:01:48] the deist gets a day Christ was
[1:01:53] born and then he says this is it
[1:01:56] and every evil thing is
[1:01:59] done but that should not be to
[1:02:03] us people who have seen the
[1:02:06] light praise the name of our to the
[1:02:09] World Christmas is eating a lot of
[1:02:13] meat you know eating the things you have
[1:02:16] not
[1:02:18] eaten yesterday were in
[1:02:21] hospital I taken my daughter
[1:02:24] Esther and then I was
[1:02:27] surprised that the place where many
[1:02:29] patients always are
[1:02:33] admitted there was no patient
[1:02:36] there all the beds were
[1:02:39] empty and so my daughter was there and
[1:02:41] we were
[1:02:45] with so now then the medical person told
[1:02:49] me said
[1:02:51] tomorrow that is today this
[1:02:54] evening going to have too many
[1:02:59] patience what's the problem what people

[1:03:05] not well
[1:03:07] prepared some are eating things too much
[1:03:11] things and even some
[1:03:14] die so to the World Christmas is
[1:03:19] feasting but for us Christmas should be
[1:03:23] feasting on the word of God praise the
[1:03:26] name of our Lord because man shall not
[1:03:28] live by bread
[1:03:30] alone but by
[1:03:33] everyone that comes out of the
[1:03:36] mouth that should be the true
[1:03:39] Christmas at time of
[1:03:41] feasting a Time ofly
[1:03:44] convocation and it should not only be
[1:03:47] one day in the
[1:03:49] year every day should be our
[1:03:52] Christmas every day should be our feast
[1:03:57] waiting on the Lord seeking the face of
[1:04:00] God doing the things that please
[1:04:03] God praise the name of our now in the

[1:04:24] me and my words abide in

[1:12:35] do wickedness
[1:12:38] drunkness all forms of
[1:12:41] evil have rejected the birth of Jesus

[1:14:32] killed on the
[1:14:36] roation so they are obsessed in
[1:14:40] that not the life of Jesus
[1:14:43] Christ praise the name of our Lord and
[1:14:45] then some days it was about buying a new
[1:14:49] clothes finishing a
[1:14:51] project I need to enter my house in
[1:14:53] Christmas
[1:14:55] so somebody spends the whole week in the
[1:14:59] village without anything about
[1:15:02] God I said I cated my Christmas in the
[1:15:05] village the other day we bought crates
[1:15:07] of
[1:15:09] beer eating this wrting this fting
[1:15:14] this nothing about
[1:15:17] God just a fake
[1:15:20] Christmas praise the name of our Lord
[1:15:23] but true Christmas
[1:15:25] Christ has to be born in
[1:15:27] us the life of Jesus Christ has to be in
[1:15:31] Us Praise the name of the Bible say the
[1:15:35] world cannot accept
[1:15:38] it because it doesn't know
[1:15:41] him they have their own mind about
[1:15:45] Christ but not to receive the eternal
[1:15:49] life that Jesus Christ brought to
[1:15:52] us praise the name of our Lord so need
[1:15:55] to allow
[1:15:56] Christ to be born in our
[1:15:59] hearts and when Christ is born in our
[1:16:02] hearts he is alive on a daily
[1:16:07] basis and our Christmas is not only one
[1:16:11] day in the year but our
[1:16:13] Christmas is every day praise the name
[1:16:17] of our Lord every day we in
[1:16:19] Christmas why we have the
[1:16:22] proof the evidence that Christ has been
[1:16:26] born in our heart for those people they
[1:16:29] are look maybe looking at the
[1:16:32] history or what the media says or what
[1:16:35] the religious person says they have no
[1:16:39] proof that Jesus was born but when he's
[1:16:43] born in your heart then you know and
[1:16:46] have the proof that truly Jesus was born
[1:16:49] and is right born in my heart praise the
[1:16:52] name of our he's living inside of me
[1:16:56] so I don't wait
[1:16:59] for and say he was
[1:17:02] born and then the rest of the year you
[1:17:04] don't think he was
[1:17:06] born I can do what I want to
[1:17:08] do but when he's born in your
[1:17:12] heart praise the name of the Lord when
[1:17:14] you have a personal relationship
[1:17:17] with it doesn't matter where you
[1:17:20] go it doesn't matter what season
[1:17:25] you'll always confess
[1:17:27] him he has been born in
[1:17:30] my praise the name of our Lord let us go
[1:17:33] to Matthew Chapter
[1:17:36] 2 praise the name of our
[1:17:39] Lord and then we go
[1:17:45] to MTH chapter
[1:17:47] 2 and then we go to
[1:17:51] verse S
[1:17:55] okay let us start
[1:17:56] from verse one just Pi the whole
[1:18:01] story now when Jesus was born in
[1:18:03] bethleem of Judea in the days of Herod
[1:18:06] the king behold there came wise men from
[1:18:09] the East to
[1:18:21] Jem saying where is he that is born King
[1:18:25] of the Jews for we have Sinister IND the
[1:18:29] and are come to
[1:18:44] worship praise the name of our they said
[1:18:47] where is he
[1:18:49] born can you imagine somebody coming
[1:18:52] from East
[1:18:55] of
[1:18:55] kilom and then he comes to
[1:18:58] Jerusalem asking
[1:19:01] you what has happened in your
[1:19:04] place and you don't know that's the
[1:19:07] world we are living
[1:19:09] in and then the Bible
[1:19:12] says when Herod the king had these
[1:19:15] things he was troubled and all Jerusalem
[1:19:19] with him
[1:19:26] they were troubled they were wondering
[1:19:30] how can this
[1:19:33] be how this happen without our
[1:19:36] knowledge but there were a
[1:19:40] religiousity living in the in
[1:19:44] Jerusalem and the Bible says do not s by
[1:19:48] Jerusalem because
[1:19:50] Jerusalem is the city of the king
[1:19:55] the great king they were in the city of
[1:19:58] the
[1:19:58] king and they don't know that the king
[1:20:02] of the city has been
[1:20:04] born they didn't know they were
[1:20:08] blind the same condition that we see now
[1:20:12] is that people are blind to the
[1:20:15] reality praise the name of our came
[1:20:19] where is he where is
[1:20:22] he praise the name of our Lord
[1:20:25] and so
[1:20:27] car called thees and the
[1:20:32] priests and ask them where should the
[1:20:35] Messiah be
[1:20:39] born where should Christ the
[1:20:43] Messiah be
[1:20:45] born and the priests were able to go
[1:20:49] back to the
[1:20:51] scriptures and said in Bethlehem Judea
[1:20:57] praise the name of our Lord and when
[1:20:59] these three wise men had the
[1:21:02] scripture they followed the scripture
[1:21:05] and the scripture LED them to where
[1:21:07] Christ
[1:21:09] was by the leadership of the
[1:21:11] star these PRI these priests here they
[1:21:15] had the
[1:21:16] scripture but they couldn't see the
[1:21:19] star praise the name of the Lord the
[1:21:22] wise men s the
[1:21:25] and they came and had the
[1:21:28] scripture combined together it them
[1:21:31] where Christ
[1:21:32] was and people may have the
[1:21:37] scriptures but if they don't have the
[1:21:40] star they can never find
[1:21:43] him praise the name of our Lord but we
[1:21:46] have had the
[1:21:48] star the message of the
[1:21:51] hour bringing the scriptures to us and
[1:21:55] showing us
[1:21:56] Christ in our
[1:21:58] generation praise the name of our Lord
[1:22:01] Christ being revealed as the Son of
[1:22:04] God and that's what brings Life To
[1:22:07] Us Praise the name of our Lord so they
[1:22:11] they had the
[1:22:12] scripture but they never had the power
[1:22:15] of the
[1:22:16] script they never had light on the
[1:22:20] scrip so they had the scripture and they
[1:22:23] just stayed with the scripture
[1:22:25] but it couldn't bring
[1:22:28] transformation and that's what we need
[1:22:30] also to be
[1:22:32] careful we can have the
[1:22:34] scripture we can have the message books
[1:22:38] we can have the
[1:22:39] text praise the name of our Lord but
[1:22:42] without the spirit of God on
[1:22:45] them we are going to miss out on the
[1:22:48] Rapture praise the name of our the Bible
[1:22:51] says there were men in the days
[1:22:56] let us go to Luke Chapter
[1:22:59] 2 and then verse
[1:23:02] 25 and behold there was a man in
[1:23:05] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[1:23:09] same man was just un devot waiting for
[1:23:12] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[1:23:14] was upon him
[1:23:29] and it was revealed unto him by the holy
[1:23:31] ghost that he should not see death
[1:23:34] before he had seen the Lord is
[1:23:41] Christ and he came by the spirit into
[1:23:44] the temple and when the parents brought
[1:23:46] in child Jesus to do him after the
[1:23:49] custom of the law then took him up in
[1:23:51] his arms and blessed God and said let
[1:23:55] Lord now let thy servant depart in peace
[1:23:58] according to Thy word for I have seen
[1:24:01] thy salvation
[1:24:30] praise the name of Lord the Bible says
[1:24:33] Simeon was in
[1:24:36] Jerusalem but Simeon was totally
[1:24:41] different from the rest of
[1:24:45] Jerusalem the priests they knew the
[1:24:49] scriptures Herod had authority to ask
[1:24:52] what does the scripture say
[1:24:55] but then Simeon the Bible says he was
[1:24:59] waiting for the consolation of
[1:25:03] Israel just as we are waiting for the
[1:25:07] rupture we are waiting for the change of
[1:25:10] our
[1:25:11] body and then the Bible says he had the
[1:25:14] Holy Ghost upon
[1:25:17] him we also need to have the Holy Spirit
[1:25:20] right inside
[1:25:22] us Christ has been been born in
[1:25:25] us the new birth we have to be certain
[1:25:29] that we are born
[1:25:31] again that Christ dwells in the inside
[1:25:34] of us and then the Bible says the Holy
[1:25:38] Ghost revealed to
[1:25:41] him and the same holy spirit that dwells
[1:25:45] in us will reveal to us the rupture
[1:25:51] praise the name of our Lord will
[1:25:53] transform us
[1:25:55] will Quicken us to be raptured we should
[1:25:59] be different from the rest of the
[1:26:02] people praise the name of our Lord be
[1:26:04] different from the rest of the
[1:26:07] people praise the name of our Lord
[1:26:10] Jerusalem for them they were
[1:26:12] troubled but now to Simeon it was
[1:26:15] revealed to him he was delighted he was
[1:26:19] waiting for the
[1:26:21] consolation it's time to rejoice the
[1:26:24] time to worship and when the Holy Ghost
[1:26:28] came when Mary took Jesus on the eth day
[1:26:31] to be
[1:26:34] circumcised you know there were many
[1:26:36] children that were brought in
[1:26:38] the but the ho spirit is so
[1:26:45] definite is so
[1:26:48] precise that this is the
[1:26:52] child so Simeon he didn't go to
[1:26:55] Jerusalem and started asking where is a
[1:26:59] child born by a virgin woman is
[1:27:02] child he was
[1:27:05] definite praise the name of our you know
[1:27:07] just like see on
[1:27:09] television some of the ministers or
[1:27:13] preachers say somebody here is having
[1:27:18] headache but we all get headache then 10
[1:27:21] people stand up that's not the Hest
[1:27:25] he was
[1:27:27] precise you sited there this is your
[1:27:32] problem the the Holy Ghost was using
[1:27:34] Brother
[1:27:35] BR in the ministry was
[1:27:39] precise exactly to the
[1:27:47] personing maybe it's the other one maybe
[1:27:50] it's the other one no praise the name of
[1:27:53] our God
[1:27:54] so we we have the Holy Spirit and the
[1:27:58] Holy Spirit is
[1:28:00] definite in his work praise the name of
[1:28:04] our but Jerusalem the rest of them
[1:28:07] missed
[1:28:10] out in the Days of Elijah going to
[1:28:15] heaven the sons of the
[1:28:18] Prophet praise the name of they
[1:28:22] heard and they able to tell
[1:28:25] El that your master is going to be taken
[1:28:27] up
[1:28:31] to you know there there was the
[1:28:34] prophet and there also the sons of the
[1:28:37] Prophet just as we have the prophet and
[1:28:41] the son of the Prophet whom are you
[1:28:43] going to hear whom are you going to
[1:28:46] follow praise the name of our but
[1:28:49] elishah he did not follow the sons of
[1:28:52] the prophets
[1:28:54] eyes were on the prophet
[1:28:56] El that's why I laid the
[1:28:58] promise not on the sons of the
[1:29:01] Prophet praise the name of the Lord so
[1:29:03] it didn't matter what the sons of the
[1:29:05] Prophet were
[1:29:06] saying what the prophet was saying
[1:29:10] that's what we go with praise the name
[1:29:12] of the
[1:29:13] Lord if the prophet says there is the
[1:29:17] fivefold
[1:29:18] ministry we go with the prophet if the
[1:29:22] son of the Prophet says
[1:29:24] press and
[1:29:25] play
[1:29:27] that you go with the
[1:29:29] prophet what the prophet teaches is what
[1:29:33] has got power to
[1:29:36] transform praise the name of our so
[1:29:39] Elisha did not go by the son of the
[1:29:42] prophet he went by the
[1:29:44] prophet and that made him see the
[1:29:48] Rapture praise the name of our Lord and
[1:29:51] the son of the prophets
[1:29:55] Doctrine but didn't have power of
[1:30:00] transformation no wonder when elishah
[1:30:03] came back they the ones who said he has
[1:30:08] the spirit of
[1:30:10] Elijah but again they told
[1:30:12] El ah maybe has fallen up on certain
[1:30:17] Mountain they had the doctrine but they
[1:30:20] never had faith in the doctr
[1:30:24] don't bring a change in their
[1:30:26] lives praise the name of our Lord isn't
[1:30:29] the same thing of the rupture we canot
[1:30:31] the doctrine of the
[1:30:33] message but why is the power that
[1:30:36] transforms
[1:30:38] us to be part of
[1:30:40] the praise the name of our Lord that's
[1:30:43] why Christ has to be born in
[1:30:45] us when he is born in us he will show us
[1:30:49] this things he will reveal to us the
[1:30:52] things praise the name of
[1:30:55] the
[1:30:55] priests in MTH 2 they had the true
[1:31:01] doctr but who of the
[1:31:04] priests who went and worshiped Jesus
[1:31:08] when went there her who said I want to
[1:31:12] go and worship Herod is who said I want
[1:31:15] to go and
[1:31:16] worship but just wanted to
[1:31:19] kill but the priests they able to quot
[1:31:24] and give it to the people and left it
[1:31:27] there it has no transformation
[1:31:30] in but yet the three wise men when they
[1:31:34] received the
[1:31:36] truth they went out to go to
[1:31:39] Bethlehem then they start
[1:31:42] appear and they
[1:31:44] Rejoice praise the name of and we also
[1:31:47] need to be
[1:31:49] joyful it was such a happy
[1:31:52] day when Jesus took away my sin when
[1:31:56] Jesus was born in
[1:31:57] my what a happy day praise the name of
[1:32:02] now let us go in this
[1:32:04] message God's Gift always find their
[1:32:09] places he says and now watch these
[1:32:12] people
[1:32:17] this they brought
[1:32:20] him watch the gift they brought him
[1:32:25] identified what they thought he
[1:32:30] was praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:32:33] briefly go back to MTH chapter
[1:32:39] 2 and then in verse
[1:32:42] 11 let us start from verse
[1:32:45] 10 2 ver
[1:32:47] 10 and when they saw the St they Rejoice
[1:32:50] with exceeding great joy
[1:32:58] and when they were come into the
[1:33:02] house they saw the young child with Mary
[1:33:05] his
[1:33:07] mother and fell down and worshiped him
[1:33:13] and when they had opened their
[1:33:16] Treasures they presented unto him
[1:33:20] gifts gold Frank
[1:33:26] and
[1:33:27] Myra and now brother Bram says now watch
[1:33:32] what these
[1:33:34] symbols that I want to talk to you
[1:33:38] about what they mean now I've got some
[1:33:42] scripture wrote out
[1:33:44] here then he says now
[1:33:48] gold and
[1:33:51] Frank and
[1:33:55] now gold in the
[1:33:57] Bible how fitting it is to
[1:34:01] Christ because God speaks of
[1:34:07] Dy gold is
[1:34:12] D then frankon speaks of
[1:34:20] service and is death
[1:34:25] so now it is
[1:34:27] God
[1:34:30] D in
[1:34:33] service to
[1:34:35] die praise the name of the Lord see this
[1:34:38] when they came to
[1:34:40] worship they came with appropriate
[1:34:45] gifts praise the name
[1:34:48] of the greatest thing you can give to
[1:34:51] God is to give yourself to
[1:34:54] God praise the name of our Lord you
[1:34:56] surrender all your life and say Lord I'm
[1:35:00] giving all my
[1:35:02] life and when you give to God all your
[1:35:06] life the other things will seem nothing
[1:35:10] to you've given him all your
[1:35:13] life so if you have given him all your
[1:35:16] life your time to come to
[1:35:20] church when you give your life to God
[1:35:24] to come to church will not be a problem
[1:35:27] to

[1:35:38] morning I could have didn't make enough
[1:35:42] who life where have you given your
[1:35:44] life praise the name of but when you
[1:35:48] give all your life to
[1:35:50] God even your time
[1:35:53] Master it is
[1:35:55] yours you are the one who gives me time
[1:35:58] because the Bible says that God has
[1:36:02] determined on
[1:36:05] Earth let us go to Job chapter
[1:36:10] 14 praise the name of the Lord Job
[1:36:16] 14 and verse
[1:36:18] 5 seeing his days are determined
[1:36:26] the number of his mons are with

[1:36:34] cannot
[1:36:39] pass that's the God we serve say the
[1:36:42] days are
[1:36:44] detered so what is that with giving him
[1:36:46] your
[1:36:48] time giving him your time to come to
[1:36:51] church giving him your time to pray
[1:36:54] giving him your time to read the
[1:36:56] word giving him your time to testify
[1:36:59] about
[1:37:00] his he says his days are with
[1:37:04] him what are you going to give to him
[1:37:07] praise the name of our Lord you know you
[1:37:10] have
[1:37:12] things praise the name of Lord but how
[1:37:15] much of those things you
[1:37:17] have are you putting into the use of the
[1:37:20] kingdom
[1:37:22] of yeah

[1:37:26] kingdom of
[1:37:29] God how

[1:37:58] is an eternal
[1:38:00] investment can say no let me pick what I
[1:38:04] have and put in the kingdom and then you
[1:38:07] see how God keeps on using you as a
[1:38:16] tributary but now if your blocks what
[1:38:19] comes
[1:38:23] it will not receive
[1:38:25] more praise the name of our Lord we

[1:40:19] prophet the more she was sustained also
[1:40:23] that's the same thing the more we
[1:40:25] support the kingdom of God the more God
[1:40:28] supports us the more God cares for us
[1:40:31] the more God provides for us when others
[1:40:34] are
[1:40:35] crying you know my Lord is with me take
[1:40:39] care of me in every kind condition he
[1:40:41] will take care of me in every
[1:40:43] condition praise the name of so still in
[1:40:46] the message God's approprate gifts find
[1:40:48] their
[1:40:50] places he says and that's what he
[1:40:57] was God
[1:41:00] D in service to
[1:41:04] Die the very thing that they brought
[1:41:06] identified what they thought he
[1:41:13] was the same thing with us what do we
[1:41:16] think of Jesus
[1:41:18] Christ what think ye of Christ
[1:41:23] and how you think about him is how you
[1:41:27] act about
[1:41:28] him praise the name of the Lord and I
[1:41:31] said that to us
[1:41:34] today the things that we bring to
[1:41:37] him identifies what our thoughts is
[1:41:41] about
[1:41:43] him you understand what I mean see if
[1:41:48] you believe it with all your
[1:41:51] heart every word of
[1:41:54] that you'll identify it by giving all
[1:41:58] that you have to
[1:42:02] it but if you believe it is a good place
[1:42:05] to associate with better
[1:42:09] people around the church and things like
[1:42:12] that that's just about what you
[1:42:16] give just a few social hours with some
[1:42:19] congregation or something
[1:42:25] but but if you really believe it with
[1:42:28] all your
[1:42:29] heart then you give
[1:42:33] everything that is in you to
[1:42:36] it see it identifies you that you truly
[1:42:41] believe the
[1:42:42] message that you believe it to be the
[1:42:46] truth praise the name of our Lord so
[1:42:49] what you give reflects what what EXA you
[1:42:53] think about
[1:42:55] it praise the name of our Lord but we
[1:42:57] need to give our
[1:43:00] everything praise the name of our Lord
[1:43:03] to God blessed be the name of our Lord
[1:43:07] let us go to Colossians chapter
[1:43:11] 3 the Bible
[1:43:14] says verse
[1:43:16] one if you then be risen with Christ
[1:43:20] seek those things which are above where
[1:43:23] Christ sth on the right hand of
[1:43:34] God so he says if you are risen with
[1:43:38] Christ if Christ is born in
[1:43:42] you all your
[1:43:44] heart is on the things that is where
[1:43:47] Christ
[1:43:48] is the Eternal things
[1:43:51] of the invis things of
[1:43:54] God they take most of your
[1:43:57] time they take most of your
[1:44:00] investment they take your
[1:44:03] commitment why because you are linked up
[1:44:05] with those
[1:44:07] things and then the Bible says where
[1:44:10] your Treasures
[1:44:12] are that's where your heart
[1:44:15] is if your
[1:44:18] Treasures are on the earth your mind
[1:44:21] will always be on the Earth
[1:44:25] so you guard it
[1:44:26] jealously but if the trees are in
[1:44:29] heaven then your heart will be
[1:44:32] there what more can I do for the kingdom
[1:44:35] of what more can I do for the services
[1:44:38] of Lord what will you have me to
[1:44:42] do praise the name of our you have that
[1:44:45] desire longing because of being
[1:44:49] identified with Christ so he says if we
[1:44:52] are risen with
[1:44:54] Christ we seek those things which are
[1:44:59] above where Christ
[1:45:01] Seth on the right hand of
[1:45:05] God now in Romans chter

[1:52:16] 2 he says set your affection on the
[1:52:21] things above not on the things on the
[1:52:27] earth for you are dead and your life is

[1:52:37] God verse four when Christ who is our
[1:52:43] life praise the name of our it's no

[1:53:10] life while the rest of them are looking

[1:53:17] history and then some of
[1:53:20] them who can afford they have got good
[1:53:23] money and have made pilgrimage to
[1:53:27] Bethlehem so they moving to those
[1:53:30] places I'm ring there when Easter
[1:53:34] comes they also want to carry the
[1:53:37] cross and then you get them almost in
[1:53:39] every
[1:53:41] town carrying the cross on Good
[1:53:44] Friday
[1:53:46] Friday no life in those
[1:53:49] things no

[1:54:13] here to be born in US freely to be born

[1:54:22] obey the word and then you see the life
[1:54:25] transforming
[1:54:27] Christ in you and the Bible says Christ
[1:54:31] who is our
[1:54:33] life not my own life now my own life
[1:54:37] died now it is Christ
[1:54:40] that and then the Bible says when Christ
[1:54:43] who is our
[1:54:45] life shall
[1:54:48] appear then shall you also appear with
[1:54:51] him in glory

[1:55:15] Earth
[1:55:17] fornication uncleanness inordinate
[1:55:20] affection
[1:55:28] andness which is
[1:55:33] idolatry it says make them
[1:55:36] dead and let Christ become alive in us
[1:55:41] praise the name of our Lord now in the
[1:55:43] message life he says now the Christian
[1:55:48] church should have the real character
[1:55:51] there
[1:55:54] and if the Life of
[1:55:56] Christ is in the Church of
[1:56:00] Christ then it is good to have the
[1:56:02] character of
[1:56:05] Christ praise the name of the Lord it
[1:56:08] will produce the Life of
[1:56:12] Christ it is just no more than just what
[1:56:16] he call in the of Common Sense
[1:56:26] if the Life of
[1:56:28] Christ if the life of the spirit of
[1:56:31] Christ is in the
[1:56:33] church it has to produce that
[1:56:37] life because the life that's in
[1:56:40] you makes your character and what kind
[1:56:44] of
[1:56:45] characters we allow to be who have
[1:56:50] Solly promised
[1:56:53] that we would serve the Lord

[1:56:58] live and we have been baptized to his
[1:57:02] death burial

[1:57:41] blood of Jesus chist and you continue
[1:57:44] moving praise the name

[2:01:49] custom
[2:01:53] that they were used
[2:01:54] to gifts being
[2:01:57] handed that's the reason it's
[2:02:01] rejected is because it's not handed to
[2:02:03] the people in the
[2:02:06] custom that they have been used to
[2:02:10] receiving praise the name of our Lord so
[2:02:13] they rejected
