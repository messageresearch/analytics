So as as the brother helps us to put in the words of the chorus, I'll be singing the verses along. God uses [music] broken things. He takes [music and singing] broken soil to bring us [music and singing] golden grain. God uses [music] broken clouds to bring us [singing] rain and broken [singing] grave [music] to give us [singing] daily bread. [music] Oh, and broken bread [music] to give us strength [singing] again. For God to [music] use us, we must be brokeen [music] down. So the seed [music and singing] of his word can be sown. [music] Man cannot live [music] by bread alone. [music] So when the [singing and music] seed is grown, [music and singing] deep inside your heart, you find the greatest [singing and music] love the world has ever known. So Lord, [music] if I'm going to be broken. So Lord, if I'm going to be [singing and music] broken. Oh, I'll rather be broken for you.

Do all you must do. [music] Oh, take me and break [singing] me and make me just [music] like you. So [singing and music] if you're feeling broken, remember what the word he's spoken [music] that a broken spirit and a contrite heart [music] will give the Lord a perfect way to [music and singing] start. Oh Lord, if [music] I'm going to be broken, [singing] Lord, I'd rather be [music] broken for you. Course, [singing] you have [music] a way of taking broken things [music] and making [singing] them just like new. [music] Lord, I don't mind the pain. [singing and music] Do all you must do. [music] Take me and break me and [singing] make me just like you. [music] Amen. Brother Rundo, are we okay? If we can just sing [music] it two more times. I I just feel like it's it's going out to someone. Amen. [music] So Lord, [singing] if I'm going to be broken, I'll rather be broken [singing] for [music] you. Cuz you have [singing] a way of taking [music] broken things and making [singing] them just like new. Lord, I don't mind the pain. [music] Do all you must do. [music] Take me and break me [singing] and make me just like you. Lord, oh Lord, [singing] Lord, if I'm going to [music] be broken, I would rather be broken [music] for you.

So Lord, if Oh, I'd rather [singing] rather be moving for you. For you [singing] have a way of taking [music] broken, making, and making [singing] them just like new. [music] I don't mind, [singing] Lord. I don't mind the pain. Oh, do [singing and music] what you must do. Take me. Take me [singing and music] and break me and make me just like you. We're going to sing [music] it just [singing] one last time. We'll be like Jeremiah. We'll be like Jeremiah. [music] Jeremiah who went to the porter's house. and the port was breaking and remolding. So sometimes God breaks us. [music] Maybe we are too proud. He breaks you [music] a bit and then he molds you again. And the prophet [music] says that he there was a shepherd. Yes. [music] And uh he he got one of his sheep. He got [music] one. The the the the sheep was not moving. Anyhow, and he broke the leg. I said [music] that must be a very cruel thing. But he said I broke the leg [music] because I wanted my sheep to know that I am the shepheran. [music] So sometimes God breaks us because we [music] are failing to listen to his voice. [music] But the prayer is if we have to be broken at any one [music] point in our lives, then we'd rather be [music] broken. For him and not for any other because for him he gets the broken [music] thing and again he molds it and makes [music] it new. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I think we can sing with more meaning now. [music] So Lord, [singing] if I'm going to [music] be broken, oh, I'll rather [singing] be broken for you. Cuz [music] you have a way of taking [singing] broken beings and making [music] them just [singing] like new. Lord, I don't mind [music and singing] the pain. Do all you must [music] do. Oh, take me and [singing] break me and make me just like [music] you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, [music] &gt;&gt; do you want to be broken for him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. See, our time is going fast. [music] I just want us to get on our feet. You can give [music] me that song. I am going to a city where the streets with gold are laid, where the tree of life is blooming [music] and the roses never fade. Amen. Amen.

[music] Precious heavenly father, our rest will be complete when we are seated at your feet this morning. We invite you in this service that you may be present with us to teach us the things that be of eternal life. I want to thank you, Father, for the things you've done for us [music] through the time since we last were together on Wednesday. Here we are present again. [music] We seek for your grace. We seek for your love. [music] seek for instructions, Lord, that we may not be found deficient [music] of your goodness. We commit everybody to your hands and their needs, [music] father, that you may supply in Jesus name. [music] Amen. Amen. We give the Lord a hand of praise. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So just turn around and shake your brother's hand. Welcome one another to the service. Praise the Lord. Welcome one another to the service. Amen. Amen. And see the goodness of the Lord in this service. Amen. Amen. So we shall turn together to the book uh of Matthew chapter 11 and verse 28. 1128. &gt;&gt; Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I'll give you rest. May the Lord had bless in the reading of his word. You may be seated. So the scripture here says we should go unto him those of us that labor and laden and he'll give us rest. You see that's a very great invitation when he says come unto me. We cannot go to any other better place but unto him if we are looking for rest. So this morning I want to speak on the subject of the rest. You know sometimes when you wake up in the morning And then you go into your labors by evening you are so exhausted you need some rest. Rest is very important for a person that's working. Amen. Amen. So he says come unto me. Look come unto me. It involves a space between you and the person calling you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm calling you from labor. Because where you are, you labor. Where I am, you rest. You stay there. You stay in labor. You come after me. You come to rest. You understand now? So he says turn around and walk back into the rest here. There is a journey to cover in between here. So but this rest is demonstrated by Paul in Hebrews chapter 4. Let's go to Hebrews chapter 4. How many of you need to rest? Yeah, you need to give yourself rest. Amen. In some of these natural things, Amen. You feel like you've labored a lot and you need to rest. He says in 410, "For he that is entered into his rest, not your rest, but his rest." Amen. Amen. So we come from all our labors and we enter into his rest. He also has ceased from his own works as God did from his. When we go to him and find rest, then we cease from our works. Like when God entered his rest on the Sabbath, he also seized from his labor. Amen. Amen. So we rest from our works, not his works, but from our own works. So we enter his rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we enter into his rest, we rest from our sinful works. Amen. Amen. And we also rest from what we think we can do to please God. There are two things here. He's calling you unto himself. When you come to him, you have come to righteousness. Are you together with me? That means you seize from the life of sin and you enter into a life of righteousness. And again once you entered his righteousness, then you have seized into laboring in such a way that you may be able to please God. Amen. Amen. So we cease from our own works that Christ may begin his works in us. Are you together with me? Your sins from yours that Christ may begin his works. Okay? That's what we call walking in Christ or walking with Christ. We ought to be born of him, filled with him and walking with him by his word. That way you have come to a rest. Amen. So let us look at Romans chapter 8 and verse one. He says &gt;&gt; there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. meaning that they've entered into the rest. So they raised from their sinful works. There is therefore no condemnation unto them because they are in Christ and they don't walk by the flesh to labor but they walk by the spirit which is our rest. So walking in the flesh, I said one labors in two ways. One labors under the unconverted sinful nature and oneself was trying to work out the works of righteousness. Verse two here for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus. has made me free from the law of sin and death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The law of the spirit now of life in Christ makes us free from the law of sin and death. So this rest I'm talking about is when one is not under the law of sin and death. Amen. Then we call therefore you know we are called therefore from our works into the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Well, that's where the rest is. The rest is in the baptism. The baptism of the Holy Spirit. Are you together with me? That's where the rest is. You entered the Holy Spirit and once you entered the Holy Spirit, then you have rested from your works. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Now &gt;&gt; I want to show you something here that the call from your work is the beginning of your rest and that rest is the work of the Holy Spirit in you. Now you seize from the law of sin and death and then the law of Christ begins to rule in you. Are you together with me? Okay. So now in Isaiah chapter 20 we can look at the definition 28. Isaiah 28 we can look at the definition. of uh of uh of rest 28:10 I'm taking time to lay the foundation you know Isaiah said for precept must be upon precept precept upon upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little and there a little is talking about the precepts of the word. That's where we start from. The word goes ahead. to bring this rest because it must be precept upon precept. The word must call you into this rest. Come unto me. The word is calling you. It doesn't call you to harder labor. It calls you to the rest. You rest from your own works and then Christ begins his work in you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 11 he says for with stmering lips and another tongue will he speak to his people. to whom he said. &gt;&gt; This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the word to rest. And this is the refreshing yet they could not hear. Amen. When he was here on earth, he called men &gt;&gt; and he says, "Come follow me, come unto me all YE WHO LABOR THAT I will give you rest." Praise the Lord. And those that came unto him, he took them into the upper room on the day of Pentecost and spoke by them from strange language. And he says, "This Pentecost here is your Sabbath, is your rest." He says, "But they didn't understand. They just continue desiring to observe the Sabbath day. But when Jesus entered into his I mean when God entered into his rest, he could not go back to work again. Amen. But under the law, because it was a shadow, they would go in on the Sabbath day and come out again, work the six days and go back in there. But in the New Testament, Jesus says that's not what's going to happen. THE BAPTISM OF THE Holy Spirit is going to be your rest. And once you enter into that rest, hallelujah, you seize from your words. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. The Holy Spirit works for the effect that he may seal you in. Amen. So Pentecost was the rest to the men that had toiled under the law in the Old Testament. Amen. Because the law was labor. Amen. They labored. They had to fulfill something. Amen. But he saw them in the law. Then he says, "Come unto me now because you are a distance away and you must come by way of justification, sanctification and the gospel of the Holy Spirit." Amen. Amen. So Paul asked the believers in the upper coast of Ephesus whether they had received the Holy Ghost when they believed. Because when you believe, you are called to rest. You are called to the person of the Holy Spirit. That's why we are called We are not called to continue in labor. We are called to enter into his rest. The rest will be Christ in you of glory. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? You cease from the law of sin and death and the LAW OF CHRIST BEGINS TO work by you. through the bas of the Holy Spirit, he begins to give you instructions. He begins to teach you when you error, he rebukes you simply because he loves you. He called you to rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; So true conversion must lead you to rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is after we had come to the call of Matthew 11:28 that we could start on the distance to enter and remain in the rest according to Hebrews 4:11. Amen. Amen. We are called and then we begin a distance. Amen. To enter into the rest and remain in it. You don't enter and come out. You enter and remain. So Hebrews 4:11 is the seal. Therefore, seal till the day of redemption. We know that scripture. Amen. Amen. Hebrews 4:11. Praise the Lord. Are you together with me? You were not called to keep shaking yourself around trying to say, "Am I making it or I will not make it?" The enemy will always try to convert your look from the promise to this thing here. You see from 10. Praise the Lord. He says, "For he that is entered into his rest, he has also seized from his own works as God did from his verse 11." Now 11, he says, "Let us therefore labor therefore to enter into that rest." Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going to be able to reconcile &gt;&gt; Matthew 11:28 and Hebrews 4:11. Now, Matthew 11:28, he says, "Come unto me, all you who labor and are laden, and I'll give you rest." But Hebrews 4:11, he's saying, "Labor to enter." So, we we want to reconcile those two scriptures. Now, brother Brham says, you know, Peter said, "Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. You begin by believing. You are justified. You are baptized. You are sanctified. You are baptized with the HOLY GHOST. NOW PAUL ASKED the believers in those parts of Ephesus, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe?" HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE CALLED COME to me and you accept. You believe and you walk yourself into the rest which is the bapt of the HOLY GHOST. SO PAUL WAS ASKING THEM NOW THAT YOU TOOK the distance to come, have you received the Holy Ghost since Amen. So people repent of their sins. They get baptized in water, but they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost. You believe unto receiving the spirit of Amen. You believe unto receiving the Holy Spirit. So the question according to Paul here. Why did you believe? You believe? So that you may receive the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. SO EVERYBODY HERE WHO has believed is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. You are called to enter your rest. There are no two things about it. You are called to enter THE REST. THAT'S WHY Paul says have you believed sins? I mean have you received sins? Amen. Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction which is towards the Holy Ghost. But the people stop there. They go as as water baptism then stop. You don't have to stop there. You are still on A JOURNEY UNTIL YOU COME to the rest BECAUSE YOUR CALL WILL COME unto me and I will give you rest. Amen. So you don't stop in between there. WHEN YOU ARE JUSTIFIED, YOU ARE STILL WALKING. When you are san justified, you are still walking. When sanctification, you are still walking. And when you receive the bosom of the Holy Ghost, THEN THE door of eternal fellowship with God has opened. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go to uh keep Matthew 11:29. We need to go all the way into taking the yoke to be YOLKED INTO FELLOWSHIP with Christ. Amen. Amen. So 11:28 says, "Come unto me all you have and I'll give you rest." 29 says, Take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and low in heart and you shall find rest unto your soul. Praise the Lord. I don't know some of you have been born in the cities and sometimes even natural things fail to teach us. Brother Brham said, your adoption, your your birth is not your adoption. An adopted son is a child who has got the ability to share in responsibility with the father. So this morning I was asking my daughter that you are expecting a baby. What if this baby is born and he say mommy call daddy here where are the titles of this land and the titles of this land? Which banks do you have the money? Which signature do you use? Because a child is born. But he cannot be adopted immediately at birth. He has to grow. As young as long as he's a child, he's like a servant. And even a servant knows more. Are you together with me? Yeah. Sometimes we need to learn from nature. So hear about the yoke, you know, I grew up uh on a farm and I grew up doing some things that the farm does to raise cattle and when I married my wife, the first thing we did was to plant, &gt;&gt; Amen. a full acre of tomatoes. I and my wife stayed in it. And after the time of end, time of reaping came, we could load a truck to bring to the market here and that's why we bought the first things we needed in life. We grew up driving tractors. But when a child I mean a cow is stubborn they get a yoke and tie it here. There are some of those cows which are very hard to look after. But the love of the father puts a yoke. Amen. on that cow. If he's starting to run, that log will keep building and it stops. &gt;&gt; He baptizes us and then places a yoke of his will. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where we say no longer but YOUR WILL BE DONE. HE PLACES a yoke on you that you can be under control. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me. For I am meek and low in heart. Because I was yucked to my father. He gave the y of obedience AND SUBMISSION. I DO NOTHING unless I see my father do. And once you get under this yoke, you find your rest. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So put the labor of sin and our good works down. Then take the yoke upon you. Because the yoke led in it doing the will of the father gave him the grace to sanctify himself for our sex. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. THE YOKE YOKED HIM to the will of God. Not my will but your will be done. When the cross was STANDING BEFORE YOU. WHAT LOOKS BITTER, it was a joy to him. That's what the Holy Ghost does when he pushes the rest. You rest under the will of God for your life. Amen. So the yoke is the mind of the father in the son. Amen. Y to his will and you let this mind be you which was also in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the yoke. You wake up every morning on your phone. You get into the yoke. Your Bible. You get into the yoke. Your meditation. You get into your yoke. Amen. You are finding the will of God to guide you and to lead you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? The title of the message is finding rest. All of us have got a lot of things that weigh on you. You need to rest. &gt;&gt; He says, "For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." Amen. Amen. So your labors while you in the world of sin. They were grievous. But his yoke is light. The yoke of submission to the father. Your labor was your human investment. Sometimes to please the Lord, &gt;&gt; you labor, you invert which way can do to be righteous. But once you get baptized by the Holy Ghost, he guides you in the word to catch his will and remain in the rest. Amen. Amen. So the Greek interpretation for labor in Matthew 11:28 is the labor that wears you down. You are trying to do your best thinking by that you are pleasing the father but you get worn down. You fight the life of sin and you are laboring but you are wearing down. That's the labor that he was calling you for a burden. It means a load, a weight, the toil. That's what he was calling you out of. Now listen, he was calling them from the toil of the law. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the judgments of the law to bring them to rest in Christ by the bapt of the Holy Ghost. And Pentecost was their rest. Pentecost is your rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, &gt;&gt; the law was holy, &gt;&gt; but man was not. And for him to handle the holy law, it was a burden. For man had fallen from the glory of God to fulfill that holy law. was a burden. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all his attempts to meet the demands of the law was defined by Christ as labor. Now listen here so that you can be able to catch what I mean. Before the fall, man did not operate under the burden of the law. I mean the burden of labor. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because after creation, man stepped into God's rest. Are you together with me? Adam only walked out of it, &gt;&gt; but on creation, &gt;&gt; he entered into God's rest. Amen. Amen. Amen. So, Adam didn't understand labor before the fall. And this rest in the time was not the absence of work. Oh, no. Let me rest. I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; And when I'm talking about rest, I'm not telling YOU TO GO BACK HOME. The pastor preached that we should rest from our jobs. We should resign. And then you wake up in the morning, you sit home, you are opening this paper of the part of the newspaper. Husband, won't you work? You don't need revelation that came yesterday that we have to rest. Congratulating you, Sister Z. God bless you. You've labored and looks like you have found rest. Amen. So let me say this. The rest in the time of Adam was not the absence of work because Adam was restful and his work in the garden. Amen. He was working in his rest. The word labor was never known before the fall. Amen. Amen. The term knowledge labor came into use after sin came into humanity. Sin caused man to lose the rest to which rest GOD IS CALLING YOU BACK TO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. And remember this rest is not the absence of work. The rest during the time of Adam was a man under divine leadership. Every evening God came, appreciated him and advised him how to go forward. Once you come into this rest, I want to tell you the Holy Spirit becomes your guide. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know the rest of Adam is a man subjected to the mind of the father. A man &gt;&gt; as a divine instrumentality a man in THE HANDS OF GOD. Once you earn those kind of things you are in your rest. Now in the message fellowship of Minipolis, the prophet says a Christian experience &gt;&gt; is blessed solemnly and holy upon rest. A true Christian must find rest. Amen. Amen. He says, "We are tossed about with everything until you come to Christ. Then it's all finished. Resting in Christ perfectly. WHEN CHRIST CALLS YOU AND you come to him, you are called because you must rest. And this rest here is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Is no longer I but Christ that liveth in is now Christ in you. The hope of glory. It's now him saying, it is now him saying &gt;&gt; that Christ me to will and to do of his good pleasure. You raise FROM THE LAW OF SIN and death to the leadership of the law of the spirit. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Adam's rest was a sublime condition. but not the absence of work. So the rest I'm talking about which Adam was in was a rest where Adam did everything he had to do and leper listen Identified masterpiece of God He says, "Now, and when he made man, that first man, how perfect it was. He looked like a god. God the great Holy Spirit roaming over the earth and the birds come out maybe and the animals different things and kept COMING MORE in the form of the one that was brooding. Amen. until finally there came up a species. Amen. A specy &gt;&gt; just exactly like the one that was doing the brooming. Are you together with me? And a little lower in that paragraph, brother says, "What a complete satis sat I mean sat satisfaction it was to God till even he rested." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "It is finished now." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; After bringing forth his image, he entered into his rest because his work had been finished. And this rest was a sublime condition, as I said, which man lost by sin. and he cannot work himself back into that rest. Are you together with me? This is a supernatural condition. YOU don't walk into IT BY the law. THEY STARTED TO LABOR. THEY WANTED to walk back into that rest. THEY WANTED TO GO BACK INTO THAT CONDITION. Nothing you can do for you to walk back into that. THAT'S WHY JESUS SAYS, NO man can come to me except my father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. WE WANT THANK GOD THIS morning because he's bringing us back into his rest. It's only grace that puts us back in that race. Grace has a sound AS A VOICE. COME unto me. Hallelujah. That's the voice of grace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; After the fall, then came the toils. after the fall. THAT'S WHEN HE SAYS, "I'll greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception. Tomorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be after thy husband. He shall rule over you. The war picture is now changed. Why? Because of the fall. Then labor comes. I don't want to go in those labor w my son-in-law here walks in there with his wife anyway because that's his work but they in labor to bring life. the word labor was not there. Now in Genesis 3:18, we find out that the word to labor in the spiritual aspect and in the natural aspect comes in after the fall. And they stay in that condition until Christ himself COMES REVERSE that condition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ must come your way. That condition. So this morning he says come unto me. If you feel you in labor, YOU ARE IN YOUR STRUGGLES AND YOU NEED GOD, come unto me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'll give you rest. When you rest in your spirit by the new birth in your entire life is properly affected in a divine manner. Amen. Praise the Lord. So he says in Genesis 3:18, "Fs also, and so shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat of the her of the field, and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground. For out of the ground it was taken for dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return. Are you together with me? Labor had not been known till after the fall. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; labor to bring forth life, labor in our families. Because when Adam got Eve, she was supposed to be a help. She was supposed to be a joy in the family with the husband. that all these things we have is a result of sin that we labor to stay together as husband of God. &gt;&gt; It's not holiness which causes that. It's the nature of sin. That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you hear what I'm saying? There is labor in the families, labor in divine service, AMEN. AMEN. YOU KNOW when you are trying to be a a a minister and you labor, &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO FULFILL SOMETHING. Are you together with me? Labor in our jobs. My my my praise the Lord. I'VE EVEN TOLD YOU LABOR six days. [laughter] Now everything labors and brother Brham says as a woman traileth all creation is travailing. Nature is prevailing. It doesn't experience that sense of rest. It's a travailing. What's all this groaning are travailing about? Like a woman that's to be a mother is trying to bring forth life upon the earth again like it was before the flood. Amen. So nature is crying for the new birth, the return of the lost rest. The sons of God lost the rest and subjected all nature and labor. And this rest must come. Amen. By the sons that lost it. That's why ROMANS 8, ALL nature is crying FOR THE ADOPTION. THE SONS OF GOD WITH THE SONS of God, NOT SONS OF CAIN, THE SONS OF GOD. A SPECIAL WORLD. When will THEY COME BACK into their positions again? This rest generally speaking must be brought back by those that lost it. The sun, I mean, nature is crying. Where are the sons of God? Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, you just go and start cutting a tree for no good reason. You throw it down and after it doesn't have life, but it cries as your cat. We are the sons of God. [laughter] Are you together with me? This is where we are. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there will be a return of the Eden of beauty and that will be the ultimate rest. That's why the scripture says There remainth a rest for the people of God. Amen. There remain A REST MUCH AS THEY'VE GOT THE BAS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. They remain as we shall be in total rest. Amen. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So man and the earth will be restored like it was before the fall. We look forward to when the earth will be again watered from the the ground. Amen. A mist from the earth. Amen. Praise God. Just trying to look at that millennium. Amen. We are entering into that rest the rest of 1,000 years. Amen. And God will show us what it was that Adam lost before he takes us over to the new Jerusalem to the new earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once again, &gt;&gt; there will be a return of rest. Amen. Amen. And in that land once again there will be the tree of life bearing 12 manners of fruit. And he would have fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree will be for the healing of the nations. But this time, there will be no tree of knowledge. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you shall have gone above the fall in YOUR RESURRECTION. ALL IN your rapture. Your body will be filtered of the human spirit. Hallelujah. That can be lied to. So the devil will not be able to lie to you because he lies to the human spirit. He doesn't lie to the soul. Hallelujah. At that time we shall be body soul and we shall be wise precept UPON PRECEPT upon land product of the world. We cannot be deceiveable. Amen. Amen. Yes sir. There is coming the millennium rest. And then the new Jerusalem where there will be no labor we shall literally enter his rest and this time never to part. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is restoring the rest and finally walk into it. Amen. Amen. Let us deal with labor a little bit. Today man is surrounded by labor. You labor in many things. A sister wrote me and said remember me in prayer. I'm find difficult to breathe. It's labor &gt;&gt; and have congested chest. You see all those elements of labor, all of you here, you labor to earn a living, you labor to sustain your families. And to an extent, you labor to live a Christian life. That's what God is calling us out of. And when God spoke about man's works in the law of Moses, he called it labor. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter whether you are a billionaire, you labor. That's right. If you are poor, you labor because that's the nature of life after the fall. Now, Exodus 20:9, &gt;&gt; he says, "Six days shalt thou labor." Six days you should labor. And usually the law of Moses was based on labor. And in labor, the wickedness of man was exposed because labor is exhausted. Amen. Amen. The law of Moses was based on labor. Do this. Do this. Do this. There was no God in it. It was just the law given to you and do the law. The law which was holy but man was not. Do you love him? Amen. Amen. Romans chapter 7 verse 5 Paul says for when we were in the flesh Paul is speaking about his past is not talking about his present. He's talking about when he was still in the Old Testament because the New Testament is in the blood. Any man WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE New Testament blood upon his soul is still under the labor of the Lord. That's right. So Paul is saying for when you were in the flesh, meaning before the new birth, listen to what he says, the motions of sin. Amen. Which were by the law, did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death, Paul is testifying to the Romans about how the law could not bring righteousness, but rather activated the motions of sin that the sin was boiling in me. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; As long as you know that THE LAW SAYS THOU SHALT not then the battle begins human nature will tell you try that's where the law begins from [laughter] and he says the more I knew the law is the more the motions of sin That's labor. Amen. Amen. Verse six. &gt;&gt; BUT NOW we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit. Not in the oldness of the letter. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see the letter in ITSELF without the spirit behind it is dead. It doesn't matter how many message books you read. The Holy Spirit has not called you into his rest. There is nothing to give what you know life. So the Holy Spirit MUST BE BEHIND OUR standing for the word to work in our lives. SO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FOR me to know I'm called to the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, it was service by the letter. But in the NEW TESTAMENT, IT SERVES by the newness of spirit is the new birth. Christ in you, the hope of glory. Verse seven. WHAT shall we say then? Is the law sin? &gt;&gt; God forbid. I had not known sin, &gt;&gt; but by the law, &gt;&gt; for I had not known last, except the law had said, "Thou shalt not cover. Yes. &gt;&gt; So the MORE knew the law without the new life of the person of the Holy Ghost is the more of commotion his spirit went to. Amen. Amen. So the law that was holy could not produce righteousness because man was weak in the will to perform. It takes the new birth. Amen. So each time man tried, he failed. And Christ called it labor. It was exhausting. Their human spirit was under bondage. The will was there. That's the power to perform. And that's why Christ called them to himself to empower them by the law of the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you have toiled and failed. &gt;&gt; And that's WHY HE SAYS, "COME UNTO ME." HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Those that are conscious that I am failing don't hide and anything come unto me. He's calling you now. &gt;&gt; Don't try to HIDE WHEN THE motions of sin is boiling within. Amen. In the garbage cans of sin, in the bus. You toilet in the shrines. You have labored with everything. You come in and then go out. You stand and fall again. That's the man God wants to talk. And he says, "Come unto me." Amen. Hallelujah. You seem like you want to give up, BUT THE CALL IS COME unto me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, now &gt;&gt; let's get into this message here. &gt;&gt; What's that in your hand? The prophet says, "When the law was given Moses, &gt;&gt; he came down and struck the rock that was in his hand, and threw it down, and broke the commandment on because of wickedness which he had which was temper." Let's stop there. The temper &gt;&gt; broke the law. &gt;&gt; I don't think it is temper with you. &gt;&gt; What's there that breaks the word? You know, that's where Christ wants to come to. What's there &gt;&gt; that stops you from coming into the presence of the Lord? Before Adam sinned, he was always coming into his presence. After the fall, he hid. It's not that he didn't have ex Jesus. He had ex Jesus. We always have excuses when there is something that bothers us. Listen. And he broke the commandments and he went back showing that priesthood Levitical priesthood would be broken. But when Jesus was in the wilderness for 40 days, Satan tempted him at his weak spot. Hunger. That's where he comes to. He'll never come to you with an alcohol bottle. If you never drunk, he'll never come to you with a cigarette. &gt;&gt; If you never smoked, &gt;&gt; he always comes to strike the weak spot. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And because you are not falling at that spot where that brother's fallen, it doesn't mean you are safe. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that weak spot &gt;&gt; and he knows &gt;&gt; how to do that tent &gt;&gt; and then he lowers his gun &gt;&gt; and then he says, "I got it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IN CHRIST, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Satan found out &gt;&gt; that there was something more than what Moses had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Trying the devil will try you on your weak spot. But there is something in you that is greater than what Moses had. THAT'S THE BAS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT that you have been called to. Amen. Christ in you. Christ in you. The hope of glory being the gatekeeper to the SOUL that is greater than what Moses had. Hallelujah. It is Christ who is our life that will fight to victory every temptation that comes your way as if you have come to the res. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Paul says is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. that is greater than Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; So under the law, man's labor was central to his righteousness. He uses his own works of righteousness to get righteousness. under the new testament which is the blood man is called to rest. So by saying come unto me. He's calling you to the word precept upon precept and then lead you over into your justification. still under precept upon precept and then gets you into sanctification which is still precept upon precept and again the bosom of the Holy Spirit which is still precept upon precept. So the rest is God calling you to receive the life in the precept. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to come to the word. &gt;&gt; No matter what the sensation is, what it looks like, how big the church is, how might the people are, you got to come back to the word of God. That's the prophet saying. Amen. Amen. Amen. We come back to the word to find rest. Amen. Come unto me all you who labor your trips. Come unto me precept upon precept line upon line here. Come unto me the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why he says obedience to the word entitles you to the talking. Amen. Therefore, he calls you into some of these areas. He begins with you by saying, repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. This is where we all began. Amen. Amen. And then it comes to many different areas after we have coming through the waterway. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then he says, but I suffer not a woman to teach not to accept authority over the man, but to be in silence. That's also part of the precept. And then he says, "Husbands, love your wife." This is a very soft spot. Now, husbands, you obligated to love your wives. And as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it, reception, ye wives, be subjection to your own husband. And if obey not the word be without the word be one by the conversation of the wives. Amen. That's also precept upon precept now through the sisters who adorn. Let it not be that outward. of plating hair and of wearing gold or putting on a prayer. That's precept upon precept. He's saying your beauty should not be in the hair you've made. He doesn't say you don't make the hair. But he says should not be in the hair that you care for. That's precept upon precept. But if a woman has long hair, It's a glory to her. Given for for for recovery precept upon priest, let us consider one another provoke unto love and good works. That's part of the world, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves. As the manner of some is, they miss a week come another to come another. Amen. But exing one another so much the more as you see the day approaching telling us that we should abstain from all appearances of evil. that the very God of peace might sanctify you. Holly Hallelujah. Soul, body, soul, and spirit. Amen. Fully sanctified. Your soul is sanctified. Fully filled with the word of faith. Amen. Your body is sanctified. Amen. set aside for holy service. Amen. IS NOT SHORT DRESS NO MORE. Sanctified body is not by this chex and star. This is a sanctified body. Hallelujah. Come out to me who labor he laden and I'll give you rest. That's a divine responsibility. Amen. Amen. in love with all that under the yoke of the law &gt;&gt; of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we can say like brother Brandham &gt;&gt; listen here my eyes &gt;&gt; is y &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; to Christ. That's your focus in life till I when I see this modern script on the street. Praise the Lord. He says, "My heart, &gt;&gt; it turns my head, my heart is so yked in love to him till I can't have love for this world anymore. My will is so yoke to him. I don't even know what my ambitions are. &gt;&gt; So y amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says when I turn and look at this strip tease. Amen. And then you said the men, &gt;&gt; the men, &gt;&gt; even the women, &gt;&gt; they look and copy, &gt;&gt; copy and paste. Not so. He says, "My eyes are so yked. My focus is so limited. I fail to appreciate anything else that is not Christ. So we need to break the bond of the flesh and be bonded to the word and the word alone. So before the New Testament which is in the blood we labored you were not born in the New Testament but the new birth in the New Testament. Amen. Amen. So we labored to earn righteousness by the works of the law. We were not looking at transformation of the inner man. We were looking at the elements of sin. So when we looked at sin as elements, we failed. You said if I smoke it is sin. Drinking is sin. Adultery is a sin. So you labored with one element at a time. But we must know that sin is a nature that Christ came to call us out. Come unto me. And once you come to him and the nature changes, then those things drop. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They just drop off. &gt;&gt; In the New Testament, we understand sin to be a nature. The life in the blood of Christ, the life that overcame sin walks to the center and takes the control of your desire. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So a call to rest. How many want rest this afternoon? Amen. We must rest. We must receive the rest. We must live like we've received the rest. We must allow the rest to work in our life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A man that has no rest is always blaming. The woman you gave me. Don't go and excuse yourself today. Tell your husband, "I have found rest. I'm not dealing with elements anymore. Amen. Doing the law of the spirit. Amen. So come to me and I'll give you rest. So you could be miles away from him and start the journey to the rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Begin to walk towards him. Let Christ be the object of your life. And on the journey to the rest, we have three manifestations. Amen. justification by faith, sanctification through the blood and the b of the Holy Spirit. The moment we break through, then we have come into contact with the person himself. Amen. We shall have come. We shall have entered into fellowship with him. That's all our goal. is not just to become a good person just to be separated. Amen. Separated from uh uh the works of the flesh. Many times when we spoke we speak about redemption that's where we end. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I go to church. I don't fight my wife. We go beyond. Amen. The works of separation so that we can come into fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ. That's what we are here for. Not to make good people. Your redemption is more than that. Amen. Amen. So Hebrews 4:11, he says, "Let us labor therefore to enter into the rest, lest any man fall after the example of unbelief." Now the word to labor in Matthew 11:28 according to the Greek interpretation is the labor that wears you down like Israel in Egypt. They were in tiring labor until God says, "I have seen the affliction." And therefore, God calls Israel out. God has seen your affliction. God has seen YOUR LABORS. HE wants to call you into rest to come from labor and take the journey. Amen. Across the Red Sea of justification, from wilderness of sanctification, the Jordan of death to self, and then enter into canon, the land of rest. Amen. Amen. So come out of the labor that tires you into the labor to possess Canaan. And this war is not tiring because THE LORD CAUSES US TO INHERIT THE LAND. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. In the rest we have seized from our labors. In Egypt they labored for no benefit. In Israel they fought wars which was not their wars. That was God's wars. And the commander of the Lord's army went ahead of them. When they got into the land, Joshua met him and he says, "Are you on our side or you against us?" And he says, "I'm the commander of the Lord's army." The war here is going to be fought by the Lord. You have now come out of the law of sin and death of the spirit out there. You labored for no gain. YOUR LABOR IS GOING TO GIVE YOU POSSESSION. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'll give you a quote here from Hebrews chapter one. I mean chapter four he says yours might have been at the 13th year the 40th year the fifth year whatever it is you have seized from your works I don't know how long you've labored but You have ceased from your work as God did from his eternally. You no more want the things of the world. The world is dead to you. Amen. Amen. So in the battle to possess the rest, we have the commander of the Lord's host standing in the land to make you possess the land. There he says, I want to make you seize from your labors. But here in Hebrews, he says labor to possess. So what's the difference there? So the word labor in Hebrews 4:11 is not the labor that tires. Amen. The Greek word there is that give diligence. Amen. to make haste to exert oneself. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; There you labored without benefit. But here the labor HERE IS TO POSSESS THE LAND [screaming] TO POSSESS THE PROMISE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Out there &gt;&gt; they benefited nothing here. This labor here IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. OUR LABOR IS DIFFERENT FROM THE LABORS OF EGYPT. &gt;&gt; WHERE ISRAEL BENEFITED NOTHING. Here we possess ground. [screaming] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here we possess ground. That is yours. That's yours. That is yours. This one, this is yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are not laboring for nothing. The law of the spirit is to make you possess. So then he says labor to enter means that don't delay. Don't be sluggish. Take your step and possess THE LAND IS THERE. THE HOUSES YOU NEVER BUILT. THE STREAMS that you never dug, &gt;&gt; all these things are here. You never planted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The pastor has labored &gt;&gt; to make us understand the beauty of the land. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now here you are possessed. Amen. So then you labor to enter and remain in the rest. And this labor in Hebrews 4:11 would be interpreted as the required diligence for you to remain in the land. You never took it for yourself. God gave it to you. But for you to stay in the land, you need to labor. And the labor here study. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer, &gt;&gt; fellowship with the saints, &gt;&gt; the daily sacrifices, those things don't wear you down. &gt;&gt; Like the life of sin where you were called from. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Will you labor to enter and remain? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:10. For he that is entered into his rest, he also receives from his own works as God did from his. Will you give him permission to take over your labors? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He takes over your labors where you try to make salvation your own work. He says now open the door for me and I'll come in. And when I come in, I want you to change your labors into the labor to enter to the promise. Study, &gt;&gt; pray, come to church, fellowship with the saints, testify of the goodness of God. Those things keep you in the Lord. Amen. Amen. So this therefore is not the labor that wears us down, but rather the positive yoke, which is a motivation to be motivated after you had the call. Amen. REST, REST FROM the law of the flesh. And therefore be motivated by the love of the spirit which is Christ himself doing his work in you. Allow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the law of the spirit of life in you begins to work in you causing you to possess ground where you always failed. The Holy Spirit comes and you don't know where the desire of alcohol went. You can't tell he came in. This is what we teach. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says the law of the spirit of God in the heart becomes the flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's now Christ on the inside, justifying you, sanctifying you, and baptizing with the Holy Ghost. It's not I anymore that's laboring. I've entered into my rest. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What were we called for? To walk a religious life? No, sir. that Christ in me may perform his will. That's the yoke in questions and answers as I finish. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, each one of those ages only taken a deep into the Holy Spirit. Justification is a work of the Holy Spirit. Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit. But the baptism of the Holy Spirit comes in now takes over. It's not a deep anymore. He now wants to come and takes charge of ourself. That's what we call the rest. Amen. It's not I but Christ in me. &gt;&gt; He wants to come and water the seed that he has planted in you and with the time you begin to bear the fruit. That's what God wants. Rest in him. Yeah. I don't know. Is that how it is sir? &gt;&gt; You rest in Christ the rest. &gt;&gt; When you are shaken, when you are tried, you can't remove Christ and the baptism of the Holy Spirit and remain with the message. That's right. Rest. &gt;&gt; What do you want to rest this afternoon? &gt;&gt; God bless you. Come into your rest. He called you. You've walked a distance. You've come into him. He wants to baptize you. But after that, labor to remain. That's where the problem is. Labor &gt;&gt; to remain. God bless you, brother. [applause] Yes, sir. Come on me, all you who labor under heavy ladder, and I'll give you rest. You want a restful church which is not in labor anymore. When we call the evening service, it's not a war. They are part of the precepts of the world. Are you together with me? When we have those conventions, you don't change your face. You have got a joy to come into that presence. Amen. That's what we are here for. God bless you. What's up? [applause] Come unto me all ye who labor and I heavy. I will give you rest. Oh come [singing] unto me all ye who labor and I heavy [singing] and I will give you rest and ye [singing] shall find rest unto your soul. It shall cease to be your own doing.

Tell him, "Lord, I need that rest. Lord, I'm tired of striving on my own. I'm tired, heavenly father, of doing it with my personal efforts. Lord, I want that rest that I can seize from my own works, that I can seize from my own thoughts, that I can seize from my ways, Father, that I may graduate, oh Lord, into a position, Lord, where I can be a love slave to you, where I can be a prisoner of Christ. [music] Like Paul said, "Oh, I am a prisoner of Christ." Father, how we desire this afternoon, Lord, if we are to be prisoners, God, then we would love to be prisoners for thee, oh heavenly father, we want to desire king of glory honestly in our hearts, heavenly father, for that rest. Oh king of glory, Lord God, you have told us this morning, oh king of glory, that the law failed. You have taught us [singing and music] this morning, oh king of glory, that human works failed, oh king of glory, and it had to take, [music] oh, heavenly father, the power of the blood of Jesus. It was no longer the bulls and gods like it was in the Old Testament. They were just covering sin. But father you had to come down oh king of glory from heaven oh God and you poured out your blood on [music and singing] Calvary oh heavenly father and you says the life is in the blood and whosoever shall believe oh king of glory in the life of the blood in the power of the holy ghost he shall find sweet rest heavenly father it is our desire king of glory Lord [singing] God Probably father, some of [music] your children could have wondered. Oh, heavenly father, some of your children, heavenly father might be going through tough situations. Oh king of glory, may you remind us, oh God, that you are the perfect rest. Oh, heavenly [music] father, may the life from within inside us, oh Lord, cause us, oh Lord, to walk in holiness, oh king of glory. Because if the life of Christ is dwelling inside us, oh Lord, then that seed, oh king of glory, that gene of Christ is able to manifest his own life within us. Oh Lord may you be gracious to us. Oh king of glory Lord give us the victory. Oh heavenly father where we stumble. King of glory Lord we thank you heavenly father because you say that even when we fall oh lord a righteous man falls but father is able to rise up once again. Not because he's able on his own but father because you have given oh lord a special ability oh heavenly father your gene oh king of glory your life is inside of us oh lord so king of glory even when we fall as human beings oh lord the power king of glory the overcoming power that transforming power lord is able to lift us up once again oh lord and cause us to walk oh heavenly Father in righteousness Lord we desire heavenly father to find that sweet rest. Oh king of glory Lord God we desire heavenly father to walk into that land [music] of promise. Oh heavenly father baptizing us oh Lord with a holy ghost. Oh father that your life oh king of glory Lord God can cause us oh heavenly father to walk oh king of glory the way that is new. Oh [music] heavenly father that you take away that stony heart oh king of glory you give us a heart of flesh oh king of glory a heart that can obey your statutes oh heavenly father a heart oh king of glory that longs after thee oh heavenly father when you give us that holy spirit within us oh father we are able king of glory lord god to desire the things that you desire oh god as you taught us through your prophet lord that the Holy Spirit feeds on the word, Father.
