[Music] Sweet spirit, sweet [Music] my soul. Everyone, let let him speak to the Lord. Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you for your grace. You've given us to come into your presence, Lord, this evening, Lord Jesus. We are so humbled, Father, that Lord, who are we, Lord Jesus, that we've received the invitation from the eternal one. Loving Jesus, Father, fill us with your goodness. Fill us with the power of the holiness, Lord, that we may worship you in the power and the beauty of your holiness, Lord. Dear loving Jesus, we have nothing to do, Lord Jesus, with holiness. Neither does our works makes us holy. Neither does our ambitions Lord makes us holy people Lord Jesus. But what makes us holy? It is when the spirit of God is upon us. Like who made uh Samson stronger? The scripture says the spirit of our Lord fell upon him. Lord Jesus where you are that's where Lord holiness is. And where you are, Lord, that is where strength is. Lord, as you told Abraham to n from thee, to n from your breast, which is the word of God, it was a sign that you are the God who gives us strength, Lord. Father, sometimes we are beaten to be weak. Sometimes, Lord, we don't feel like we are are moving onward, Lord. But in the name of Jesus, a little a while, Lord Jesus, you give us an grace and you strengthen us, Lord, by the word of God, by the meditations of the scriptures, by the remembering, Lord, of the word, Lord Jesus, which is written, Father. That's why we pray, Father, as you promised us, Lord, that you will never leave us. I pray in the name of Jesus, may you come now and live with us, Lord. May you come and direct our paths Lord. May you come and guide our footsteps Lord. And may you come and lead our decision making father. Sometimes Lord we move quick to the extent that Lord we decide wrongly Father but Lord Jesus forgive us Lord and all all together forgive our shortcoming Lord and Lord Jesus fill us with your love Lord as we approach the coming of our Lord we see nations are breaking Israel Lord they awakening Lord that fig tree is putting parts but Lord Jesus the Gentiles days are numbered and father we see the message is been rejected Lord until it will be uh fulfilled that as Israel rejected the word the same thing is going to happen Lord in the days you know of Gentiles but I pray in the name of Jesus may you seal us Lord with the power of the spirit of God that Lord Jesus you may keep us Lord and you preserve us Lord that Lord we may be father revealed to the last day in the days of that rapturing day Lord when the uh rising saints shall be rising up Lord let our faith Lord may you increase our faith Lord and may our faith stand Lord that Lord Jesus as the Lord looked in time he said will I find faith I pray in the name of Jesus may you Lord keep our faith in the name of Jesus as you kept the faith Lord of William Marion Brham in the times Lord when his life was almost disorganized Lord and he had nothing to do Lord but he promis he said the faith kept him Lord so Lord Jesus may you keep our faith Lord that we may stand Lord sure and confidence Lord oh precious heavenly father we are yours Lord as you've chosen in us Lord. May you sustain our lives Lord spiritually Lord and may you make our lives to live worth of this gospel Lord. Father Lord Jesus without this gospel there is nothing Lord we can cling unto Lord. Without this way Lord the other way Lord Jesus is the way of destruction Lord. However much it is straight. However much Lord it is so squeezed Lord and few are choose it Lord or find it. I pray Lord Jesus may these few people Lord maintain their walk in this way Lord Jesus as the prophet says we stay in the way we stay in the white line we stay straight with the word of God father Lord if we've gone short of your glory if we've gone short of your word if there is some little unbelief in the hearts Lord may you melt it Lord and forgive us Lord that we may come back Lord that we may really Father esteem your word more precious Lord that as Moses Lord esteem the reproach of Christ more than the riches of the world. Father I pray in the name of Jesus may you make us one of you know your servants. May you make us one of your children. May you make us uh obedient Lord to your word. We thank you Jesus. I commit your ser the service into your hands and I commit father your children as they have come to hear the word. May you Lord Jesus Christ give them grace and uh revelation Lord that Lord whatever the minister is going to preach the pastor Lord let it come inside of our hearts Lord inside of our souls father Lord Jesus that it may find a bedding ground Lord that when the water comes the waters of the rains of the Holy Spirit let it find a seed in there Lord that Lord in due time that seed is going to Jatiz Lord we appreciate we appreciate you Lord we give you thanks and glory in the mighty name Lord God of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen Lord my rest is complete while I see at your feet. Sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. My sheep know my voice and the pastures of me. [Laughter] Follow wherever I go.

We thank God for this opportunity of being again in his presence. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we want to thank you so much, Lord, for the privilege that you've given unto us that we can come into your presence, Lord, and you promised us that where two or three are gathered in your name, you will be there in their midst. And so, we believe you are here, Lord. You also promised us that they shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be their peace. May you teach us heavenly father that in such troubleous times we can have an anchor holding and be ready for the rapture that will happen. We bring all our burdens and needs into your hands. Praying that lord may have preeminence father. and reveal yourself to us and show us the path that we have to take and heal the sick in our midst. Deliver the captives Father and grant grace to every one of us as we walk in this journey. We love you Lord and we thank you. Bless us with your word revealing yourself to us father in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us go to our Bibles. &gt;&gt; We're reading in the book of Deuteronomy from verse one to verse 6. Deuteronomy chapter 8 from verse one to verse 6. So the Bible says, "All the commandments which I command thee this day shall you observe to do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers." And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these 40 years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether th would keep his commandments or not. for [Music] And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and feed thee with mana which thou knowest not. Neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread alone, but by everyone that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord does man live. Thy remarks not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell these 40 years. So thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as man chastises his son, so the Lord thy God chastises thee. Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. May God bless his word. You may be seated. I want to preach on the subject living by the word. Praise the name of our Lord. Living by the word. Now we can just get maybe an understanding that like our natural bodies, they need the natural food to be alive. Praise the name of the Lord. Because like if you don't eat, you'll finally die. Because these bodies, they draw from the natural food. they draw from the natural food, you know, the food which is natural here on earth. And when you look at the scriptures here, when we go to Genesis chapter one, praise the name of our Lord. Then we can take from chapter 1 &gt;&gt; and then we read in verse 12 or verse 11. And the Lord said, "Let the earth bring forth grass and the hub yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth." And it was so. Amen. Amen. We want to receive our pastor back. Thank God he granted himself covering mercies. So now when God wanted plants, he commanded the earth to bring the plants, you know, the trees, you know, the grass, &gt;&gt; the crops and everything. And now as the earth brought forth those plants, you'll find that for the plant to be alive, It will need to be from feeding from the source where it came from because the plants came from the earth and even it is food is on the earth you know. So they have to draw their livelihood from the earth [Music] where they came from. But now if you say okay I want this plant so much maybe like a flower and then you say okay I want I want this flower. I'm going to hang it in my sitting room because I love it. you're already killing it because if it is not attached from on the earth where it came from is going to perish. It is the same thing also here when God wanted fish in Genesis chapter one. And then in verse 20, he says, "And God said, let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life and fall that may fly above earth upon the firmament of heaven. And God created the wells and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fall after his kind. And God saw that it was good. praise the name of the Lord. So now when God wanted the fish, he spoke to the waters on the earth. And when he wanted the birds, you know, he talked to the waters in the in the space and then the water brought forth birds. Then the oceans brought forth fish. And so you find that for a fish to be alive, it will need to live in the waters because that's where it came from. Praise the name of the Lord. But if you remove the fish from the water, you are killing it. The same thing with animals. Now, when God wanted animals, he said in verse 24, and the Lord said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, [Music] cattle and creeping things, and the beast of the earth after his kind. And it was so. &gt;&gt; So the animals had to come from the earth. &gt;&gt; So even their livelihood, they get their food from the earth. Praise the name of our Lord. So they live by the earth. Now when you turn around to man, when God wanted fish, it spoke to the waters. When God wanted animals, he spoke to the earth. When God wanted plants, he spoke to the earth. But now when God wanted man, whom did he speak to? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. When God wanted man, he spoke to himself. Let us make man in our image. Now we see that as the fish cannot live without the waters. The plants cannot live without the earth. The animals cannot live without the earth. So even man cannot live without God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Man came from God. So the livelihood of man is drawn from God. That's why he said man cannot live by bread alone but only the word of God. Now to live by the word of God means that the word of God guides your path all the way. It guides your decision making. It guides your speech. It guides your action. Whether you at home, let the word take charge over everything you do or you are at a place of work, let the word take charge over everything you do. And that's how you can live by the word of God, implying that every decision you make is based upon what the word of God says. You know in the circumstances that you are in in the message God's provided way of healing. Brother Brandham says so I am a fundamental believer in the Bible. [Music] what the Bible says. I believe it and I believe it is the truth and ready to hang my soul on any phrase of the Bible, on any sentence of the Bible, whatever it might be that God's word is everlasting truth. It is inspired and written and we stay with it. Praise the name of our Lord. He says he's ready to hang his soul on what the Bible says. So now you are allowing the Bible to influence your life in everything. [Music] So then in every walk you walk, you have faith in the word of God, praise the name of our Lord. So now Moses was telling the children of Israel in Deuteronomy chapter 8 that God led you these 40 years [Music] and his desire for you is that you observe all the commandments of God that you may live. Praise the name of our Lord. living by the word of God. So to live by the word of God that means that you obey the word of God in every instance not on some. Praise the name of our Lord. God told Timothy, "Praise the name of our Lord. Take the word of God without partiality, you know, taking only what you want and leaving what you don't want. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to first 5:21. 1 Timothy chapter 5 verse 21. &gt;&gt; It says, "I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that though observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. you know without taking this that I would take this and then I would reject this. If you take the word of God like when Paul was telling the king, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but I've declared unto you the whole council of God. And that's how we need to receive the word of God. Take it with all your heart, all your mind. And then the word influences your lifestyle. The word determines your decision. It's what guides you. Praise the name of our Lord. Because the word of God is described in the scriptures in different forms. Like in the book of Psalms, the Bible says that the word of God is a lamp unto my feet. And you need a lamp when you are making one step at a time. You know when you are moving step by step because you need to see where you're putting the next step. So it helps you on your daily walk. It helps you the decisions you make in the morning. It should influence your decision at the beginning of the journey. The small things that you do. You know the small things you get involved in, the light things you take charge of one step at a time. That's a lamp. You know, it helps you to see where you are so that you can make the next step. But the word does not only stop at being a lamp, but the word of God still. The Bible says it is a light, you know, a light unto my path. In other words, it shows you where your destination is, where you are going. So you are seeing your destiny. It may be hundreds of miles. It may be a 100 years ahead. Praise the name of the Lord. And sometimes you can make a decision today that can affect you the rest of your life. So the word of God has got the ability to guide you in making a longlasting decision that you'll appreciate even when you are old. I said Lord I thank you. I accepted the Lord Jesus as my personal savior when I was still young. &gt;&gt; So you don't regret about middle life crisis. Because you made the wrong decision of you made the right decision of marriage. You made the right decision of accepting the Lord Jesus as your personal savior. You made the right decision of who your friends are. You made the right decision of the kind of work you're going to do. Long-term impacts. So the word of God is a light unto my path so I can see my destination. Praise the name of our Lord. So now again the Bible expresses the word of God not only as the light or not only as the lamp but then the Bible again guides shows the word of God. as the living water. Praise the name of our Lord. And then he shows the word of God as the living bread. You know, it shows the everything. Praise the name of our Lord. Why? Because the word of God is God himself. Praise the name of our Lord. God himself. Now in this in the message the great greater than Solomon is here &gt;&gt; he says you know there is something about it man knows that he come from somewhere and he is here and he don't know why he is here and he is going somewhere Yeah. And he doesn't know where he is going. And there is only one book in the world that tells us, who we are, where you come from, what you are, and where you are going. And that is the Bible. It's the only one. That tells you and it is God's book it is God himself manifested in word form called a seed. That seed in the right kind of ground will produce every promise that he made because it is God himself. But it has to be watered by faith to make it come to pass like any other seed. Praise the name of our Lord. So now when you receive the word of God, when you hear the word of God, you must have faith in the word. Praise the name of our Lord because the Bible tells us without faith. It is impossible to please God. And faith comes by hearing of the word. So now the more you hear the word of God, it builds your faith. You know, you believe in that same word and then as you believe that word, it influences you, the word becomes flesh in you so that you become the manifestation of the word of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He says he is the thing. &gt;&gt; He was the prophets. He was in them. He was in the psalms. He was in the history and he is the things to come. The same yesterday, today and forever. Hebrews 13:8 he should be then he should be the principle [Music] if that is he is and we believe then if he is that then he should be the principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing So he says Christ should be the principal theme of our talking. He should be the principal theme of our thinking. It should be the principal theme of our singing. It should be the principal theme of our works. Praise the name of our Lord. So it is Christ in my talking. It's Christ I'm exalting in my thinking. It is Christ I'm exalting in my singing. It is Christ I'm exalting in my walking. It is Christ I'm exalting. It should be the principal theme of our life. If is the principal theme of the Bible and the Bible is in us then he should be the principal theme of everything. Everything that we do that we say or think should be Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Christ is the word of God. So then you are living by the word. You are depending upon God. All your life. You know your your decision making. Your walking. Praise the name of the Lord should be based on Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Matthew chapter 4. And then we start reading from verse one. The Bible says, "Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights, he was afterward and hungered. [Music] And when the tempter came to him, he said, "If thou be the son of God, command that these stones be made bread. Now the devil always comes to tempt us and the purpose of Satan that he can take you from the word of God. That's the main purpose of Satan. When he came to Eve in the garden, it was to make her turn away from the tree of life and focus on the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Satan that's how he keeps on playing. &gt;&gt; So now he finds Christ hungry and then he tells him there are stones here. Why don't you make them break to take his attention and put him to the natural things and that's what the devil does all the time. But Jesus answered and said, "It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, you know, because he tested him on the basic things. What do you live by? Praise the name of our Lord." And we can also find out ourselves. What do we live by? When you are in trouble, what is your immediate reaction when you get into trouble? When you fall sick, what is your first action? Where is my insurance card? Insurance? How much money do I have? Can we run to the hospital? Can I move in time? Which hospital am I going to? What is your first reaction? Do you think about God as the healer? And then you say, Lord, I am sick. But you say it, &gt;&gt; by your stripes we are healed. Praise the name of our Lord. That's why you should start from. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's what you should start by in any kind of situation you get into first acknowledge God. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says in in Proverbs chapter 3. I think we can go there. Proverbs chapter 3 and then we read in verse 4. Proverbs chapter 3 and then we read verse 6. Let us start from verse five. The Bible says, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart." &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible is telling us. with all your heart trust in the Lord and lean not on thy own understanding in all thy ways. Acknowledge God and he shall direct your paths. That's where you start from. If any trouble comes in, bring God on board. Lord, this is the situation I'm going in. Lord, this is the trouble I'm going in. Lord, I call upon your name. So, you are depending upon God. You are not looking at the money you have. You're not looking at the friends you have. You are not looking at the family you have. not looking at the systems you've put in place like now maybe you hear thieves outside then you say is this camera working about this one here is the dog awake is the alarm awake first call upon the name of the Lord because the Bible says that the watchman watches in vain If the Lord does not watch over the city. So you commit everything into the hands of God and say, "Lord, I'm hearing this. Lord, there is this trouble. Lord, there is terrible headache I'm feeling. Lord, there is a trouble that has befallen us. Come and take charge over this." That's where you start from. And then the Bible says then God from there he will guide your steps. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. He will direct your paths. Then you can say ah I'm attacked by thieves. I'm committed to the Lord in prayer. Then you can say oh do I have police line? Can I call my neighbor? You know the Lord is guiding in everything. The child is very sick at home. You've laid your hands on the child. Let's pray for the mercies of God. You rebuked that fever. You rebuke that demon. You said, "Lord, deliver my child. Heal my child." Then you can say, "Let me take the child to the hospital." He guides your footsteps. He knows exactly where to go. Praise the name of our Lord. So that's how we live by God depending upon him in everything that we go through. Praise the name of our Lord. You rely on him and say, "Lord, come to my rescue. Lord, I'm troubled here. I can't proceed further. Praise the name of our Lord. You know you depend on him. You call upon his name not first taking a a running then when you reach there and you are getting stuck then you start remembering God. Oh God now when time has gone you wasted a lot how to call upon the name of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord because that's what the Bible tells us that shall call upon the name of the Lord in Romans chapter 10. Romans chapter 10 and then we can read in in verse 13, &gt;&gt; whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Praise the name of our Lord. Whosoever calls upon his name shall be delivered. God will come down to your rescue. So you are depending upon God. You are living by the word of God. Every scenario you get to. Every challenge that comes along, you call upon the name of the Lord. And this is how Christ lived in the temptation. It was not looking at the the need of the natural food, but he said living by the word of God. So then the devil takes him to another point. Praise the name of our Lord. And the Bible says verse 5 of Mark 4, then the devil takes him up in the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple. and says unto him, "If you be the son of God, cast yourself down. For it is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning you, and in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone. Now see the devil, brother Brham says the devil was quoting. He was not quoting. So he was quoting it so that he presented to you very attractive. God said this like there is an instance I think it was during the time of and then somebody wrote that I will give you all things. He went and took half of the scriptures of Matthew chapter 19. All these things will I give you if you worship me quoting. Then people were responding and this man who was doing the survey he said 97% of the people are saying amen. Amen. Amen. And then he followed some of them were pastors. And then he followed them. Then he was asking whom were you responding to as a man? But this was the devil telling telling Jesus. If you worship me, I'm going to give you all the things. Then you also go and cut half of that scripture. And then you use it and then say, "Amen. I receive this." Amen. Not going back to find out where does this apply. Praise the name of our Lord. What is the application of this? Because the word has a season of application. Praise the name of our Lord. As it is season, there is a time of its fulfillment in a particular condition. So now Satan was tempting Jesus and then Jesus had to go back to the word to make the right application of the word not the way the devil uses the word because Jesus is the word himself and he said don't tempt me Satan praise the name overlord. So we need to learn how to live by the word of God that we live in life. Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us go to Psalms 104 and then verse 27. Psalms 104 verse 27. The Bible says &gt;&gt; this wait all upon thee that thou may give them their meat in due season. Praise the name of our Lord. So the word has to be fulfilled in the due season in the season that God has ordained in the plan of God in the mind of God like now when the scripture says in Acts chapter let us first start with Luke 1 verse 20 the Bible says And behold, you shall be dumped and not be able to speak until the day that did things shall be performed because you believe not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season. [Music] Now you notice that the word has been given to us. But the word must be fulfilled in his season. The season that God has planned that be fulfilled. And that's why we need the Holy Spirit. Because the Holy Spirit is the giver of the word and he knows when the word has to be fulfilled. Like when Simeon was waiting upon the consolation of Israel, the Bible says the Holy Spirit was upon him and the Holy Spirit promised him that you will not die until you see the Lord is Christ. So now the Holy Spirit gave the promise. It was the word of God. The same Holy Spirit that gave the promise knew the time of fulfillment. [Music] And now we are living in the time of fulfillment of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the name of the Lord. We are living in the season for the rapture. And so now we have to come back to ourselves and then find out am I ready for the rapture because this is the season. These are the times of preparation. Praise the name of our Lord. You know when Jesus Christ was had finished as had resurrected, the disciples came to him in Acts chapter one. And then verse six and when they were there come together, they asked him of saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? You know, they desired that time to come first. They desired the fulfillment of that. But then Jesus tells them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his power. So they were looking at something which was not of their time, which was not of their season and desired to be fulfilled, but he told them, "You shall receive power." Praise the name of our Lord after the Holy Ghost is come upon. He said this is what you need now. Praise the name of our Lord. That was now in the second exodus. We are living in the time of the third Exodus. And the third exodus has a fulfillment has got its fulfillment of the things that God has promised. And in this third Exodus, the promise that we have is the change of our bodies from this mortal bodies to immortality. Praise the name of our Lord. where these bodies can no more die. It is a time to manifest our full redemption. [Music] Praise the name of our Lord. You know the Bible tells us that we need to be born again of the incorruptible seed which is the word of God. And we are living in a time where these corruptible bodies We are going to put on the incorruptible bodies. Praise the name of our Lord. It's the season of fulfillment of this. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Luke chapter 21. And then we read from verse 29. Luke chapter Luke chapter 21 29 the Bible says and he spoke to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees and when they now shoot forth you see and know of your own selves that summer is now at hand. So likewise ye, when you see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Very I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled. Now he's referring to the fig tree and brother Brandham tells us the fig tree is Israel and Israel is our time calendar. It shows the time we are living in. They are in their homeland. You know, you know on Monday I was listening to the speeches of their leaders when they were hosting the president of USA. When they when they were talking, they speak of parliament, you know, he would refer to the scriptures and then he would pray. Then again the prime minister. He would also refer to the scriptures. Everybody was just about scriptures. They were identifying their position. Praise the name of our Lord. The promises of God were calling upon them. A fig tree. They are just ready to receive the Messiah. But now before they can receive the Messiah, the rapture has to take place because the gospel has to leave the Gentiles and then go to the Jews. Now Jesus says when you see these things happen praise the name of our Lord know that the kingdom of God is very near and says this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled. Now you look at the emphas. Heaven and earth will pass away but my words shall not pass away. Praise the name of our Lord. And this is where we are standing that all the word of God has to come to pass. But now when it comes to ourselves, are we ready? What our preparations like? Are we living by the word of God? Verse 34. And take it to yourselves. But lest any time your hearts be overcharged with suffing and drunkenness and cares of this life. that day come upon you unaware. Now that's now what we need to check every other day. How am I living? Am I overcharged with drunkenness? You know you are taken up by the things of this life. The word of God has no control over your life. So then that day comes upon you unawares the economic situation is not good all over the world. And then they were saying there are many people in USA. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord who are even begging to buy groceries, [Music] poverty increasing in Canada. People are not giving birth to children because of the cost of of housing. in Europe and on other countries. And you see the Bible says that there will be a time where you're not going to buy where you're not going to sell until you have the mark of the beast. So the economies of the world have to reach that level. They have to collapse until they are governed by the beast. We are living in the season of fulfilling of these scriptures. The troubles of the cares of life have to increase. What am I going to eat? What am I going to do? until people are trying to check everything they do. Those developed countries, they're wondering, do I need to take my children to the university to this expensive economy? Is there any need to take children for further studies? You know the things are turning upside down. the cares of life. It's becoming a big burden. And so now you find that all your mind goes into the cares of life. No time for church because you have to look for the next money. If you have even you'll still find it's not enough because troubles keep on coming, needs keep on coming, uncertainties keep on coming. So it's the time we have to live by the word of God. Praise the name of the Lord. depending upon God in every situation. But even when you get something small, you put it in the hands of God. Praise the name of the Lord. Pay your tes, pay your offerings and how God can magnify that little that you not postponing it. Maybe next time next month may be even harder and very unfortunate even the little of next month may not come but you need the protection of God to see that he guards whatever you have. So he says for as a snare shall it come upon all of them that dwell upon the whole earth. Watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come upon the earth and stand before the son of man. Praise the name of our lord. We need to live by the word of God. Praise the name of our lord. I want I can conclude. Now let us go to numbers chapter 15 and then verse 37. Numbers chapter 15 and then verse 37. sound. So the Bible says, "And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, &gt;&gt; speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon them fringe of borders a ribbon of blue. And it shall be upon you for a fringe that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them and that you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which you go a waring [Music] that you may remember and do all my commandments and be holy unto your God. I am the Lord your God which brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So he says in your garments You put fringes, you know, at the borders of your garment. You put the fringes of blue, &gt;&gt; you know, a ribbon, something you you you saw around like this and then it was blue, you know, a heavenly color. You may look at them and then when you look at them, you remember the word of God so that you don't go by what you see. You don't go by what you see. So that you don't go by the desires of your heart. But then when you look at the reband of blue, then you remember the word of God that can guide you in the scenario that you are going through. Maybe it is a temptation. Maybe it is a trial. Maybe it is a trouble that you are going through. You look at the reband And then you remember the word of God. What does the word of God say in the situation that I'm living in? Praise the name of our Lord. They had to be influenced by the word of God [Music] in every situation that they were going through. What does God require me to do in this circumstance? How should I take the Christian walk? Praise the name of our Lord. And so when God commanded the priests also when God commanded the priests, he told them, "Put on garments which are for glory and beauty." [Music] And then on your crown, you know, on the crown of the high priest, he had to put the words holiness unto God. Praise the name of our Lord. Living by the word of God. So when you allow the word of God to influence your decision making, every decision that you do, like when he told them in Deuteronomy chapter 6 and then verse six, he says these words which I command you this day shall be in your heart. Praise the name of our Lord. You keep the word of God in your heart because in the heart of man, that's where understanding is. In the heart of man, that's where the issues of life come from. In the heart of man, that's where the thoughts come from. That's where decisions come from. So then in your heart, you need to have the word of God. That word of God in your heart will influence your decision making will influence your walk will influence your talk. You'll not just move anyhow. But the word of God that's in your heart will guide you in everything that you do. And when the word of God is in your heart, the word of God becomes your protection. But it can't protect you if it is not in the heart. Praise the name of our Lord. So make sure that the word of God is in your heart. That's how it can protect you. That's how it can safeguard you. That's how that word can become alive in your life if it can be in your heart because the word is the seed and the heart is the ground. So how will the seed grow in the ground when the seed is not in the ground? How will the seed grow in the grow when it's not in the ground? So you have to have the word of God. into your ground which is the heart and your heart must be a fertile ground watered by faith meditating upon the word of God like in Psalms 1 verse two but his delight is in the word of God and in the word of God he meditates upon it day and night That's how you can live by the word of God. Praise the name of the Lord. And then the life, the benefits of the word all come to be manifested in your life. If you are troubled with evil thoughts, put the word of God in your heart. If you fear at night, put the word of God in your heart. Situations are bad about you. Put the word of God in your heart because the word of God is light. All that darkness, all the darkness will disappear from there. Praise the name of our Lord. So then the Bible says in Deuteronomy chapter 6 and then verse 7, &gt;&gt; "And you shall teach the word diligently unto your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. So he says the word is in your heart. So you teach it to your children, to your house, you talk of the word. When you sit down, you talk about the word. When you are walking, you talk about the word. When you lie down, you talk about the word. When you rise up, what is it? Man shall not live by bread alone. but by every word that proceedth. And proceeding is continuous. That means you have allowed the Holy Spirit to teach you continuously. You take time and read. You pray, "Lord, I don't understand this scripture. Lord, I don't understand this message." You wait on the Lord. You think about it. You pray about it. And then the Lord gives you understanding. You know, you keep on moving. Sometimes you may not understand. You may be like the who was coming from Ethopia. He was reading the book of Isaiah. How they took him like a sheep and he didn't have any understanding. And then he was wondering who does the prophet talk about? Is he talking about himself or somebody else? But this man, this un much as he had limited understanding, he kept on reading his Bible. Praise the name over. And that should be the same thing with us. The little that he knew, he would go to Jerusalem to worship. Even us, we need to hold the little we know. We need to be obedient. The little we know. And we keep on reading. Lord, I don't understand this. And then one day, God, brought Philip &gt;&gt; and then Philip was able to break it. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit in his time comes and reveals to you what it is. So then he says, "And you shall bind the word upon your hand and in the frontlets between your eyes, and you shall write them upon the posts of your house and on your gates." So you see the word should influence whatever you do in your work, at home, &gt;&gt; your work, what you see, all aspects of life. You need to allow the word to take charge. And that's how you shall live by the word of God. Living by the word of God. Amen. May God bless you so much. Amen. God bless you. So I would call upon the youth to come on Friday afternoon so that we help in doing the cleaning of the church. Praise the name of our Lord. Then on Sunday we have two services. So see that you come early enough. We shall be having a number of visitors. about 200 people have already confirmed the coming and then also call upon your contributions. Praise the name of our Lord. So let us sing that song. Let us sing that song which says living by faith. Amen. Let us stand up. I care not what today may bring.
