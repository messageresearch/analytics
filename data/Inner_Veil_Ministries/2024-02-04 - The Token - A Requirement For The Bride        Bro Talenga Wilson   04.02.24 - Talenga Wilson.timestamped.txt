[32:26] this we shall read verse
[32:29] one up to verse
[32:32] 5 we shall get seated and read following
[32:35] scriptures when we are
[32:38] seated amen and the Lord spoke unto
[32:41] Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
[32:48] saying this month shall be unto you the
[32:51] beginning of month it shall be the first
[32:53] month of the year to
[32:56] you
[33:05] to all the congregation of Israel
[33:08] saying in the 10th day of this month
[33:12] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[33:15] according to the house of their fathers
[33:17] a lamb for an
[33:25] house
[33:38] and if the household be too little for a
[33:40] lamb let him and his neighbor next unto
[33:43] his house take it according to the
[33:45] number of the souls every man according
[33:47] to his eating shall make you count for

[34:23] out from the sheep or from the goats
[34:41] amen may the Lord bless his word we may
[34:44] get amen amen so as you
[34:48] SE let's go through verse
[34:51] 67 11 12 and
[34:55] 13 verse six says and you shall keep it
[35:00] up until the 14th day of the same month
[35:03] and the whole assembly of the conation
[35:05] of Israel shall kill it in the
[35:25] evening
[35:29] is and they shall take of the blood and
[35:32] strike it on the two side posts and on
[35:35] the upper door post of the houses
[35:38] wherein they shall
[35:49] eat and thus shall you eat it with your
[35:53] loins guarded your shoes on your feet
[35:56] and and your stuff in your hand you
[35:58] shall eat it in in haste it is the
[36:01] Lord's
[36:17] Passover for I will pass through the
[36:20] land of Egypt this night and will Smite
[36:23] all the firstborn in the land of Egypt
[36:26] both man and Beast and against all the
[36:29] gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I
[36:33] am the
[36:50] Lord and the blood shall be to you for a
[36:54] token upon the house houses where you
[36:57] are and when I see the blood I will
[37:01] Passover you and the plague shall not be
[37:03] upon you to destroy you when I made the
[37:06] land of
[37:18] [Music]
[37:23] Egypt praise the Lord so we all know
[37:26] this
[37:28] scenario we have read this scripture so
[37:30] many
[37:32] times how God instructed
[37:36] Moses how God gave Moses a
[37:39] message praise the Lord to take to the
[37:42] children of Israel in
[37:46] bondage praise the Lord and how the
[37:49] people received the
[37:52] message praise the Lord and now it came
[37:55] to a Time
[37:57] of
[37:58] Separation praise the Lord because Moses
[38:01] had preached this
[38:03] message to the people in the
[38:06] land regardless of whether it was an
[38:10] Israelite or it was an Egyptian remember
[38:13] they were mixed up praise the Lord the
[38:16] children of Israel were born
[38:19] servants and then they had their
[38:22] masters who are the
[38:24] Egyptians so it was a mixed
[38:27] congregation but now this
[38:30] message that Moses brought to the
[38:33] people was going to
[38:36] separate praise the Lord was a message
[38:39] of
[38:40] separation between those that we are
[38:43] predestinated to receive
[38:47] it praise the Lord and those that we are
[38:50] not and so he preached the message the
[38:54] way the message had been given unto him
[38:57] so now Moses goes to the
[39:00] congregation and begins to preach the
[39:03] message together with Aon and they begin
[39:06] to tell the people what the word of the
[39:08] Lord had
[39:10] say praise the Lord and now whosoever
[39:13] was predestinated to hear this message
[39:16] and believe
[39:19] it believed it and it caused an impact
[39:23] on their
[39:25] lives whoever was not
[39:28] predestinated they listened to the
[39:30] message they enjoyed Moses's
[39:33] teaching but they did not believe what
[39:36] Moses
[39:38] preached and it also caused the
[39:40] difference the prophet teaches us in one
[39:43] of the
[39:44] messages I think it's a message
[39:46] desperation that this message that we
[39:50] preach we preach it to
[39:53] everyone we preach it to every
[39:55] individual in
[39:57] yes but we know that this
[40:00] message is meant to reach out to a
[40:02] specific
[40:04] soul that was known before the
[40:07] foundation of the
[40:08] world but does not stop us from
[40:10] preaching this
[40:13] message that's why Moses went ahead to
[40:15] preach the message
[40:18] any until the message reached the Final
[40:22] Destination praise the Lord and now at
[40:25] the end of the
[40:27] message the scripture says that I will
[40:30] pass through the land of
[40:33] Egypt this was a message of
[40:36] judgment and Moses was telling them
[40:39] after all the plagues that have hit this
[40:43] land there is coming another
[40:47] plague the plague of death and was
[40:50] telling them to guard
[40:53] themselves was giving them the
[40:55] instructions that God had given unto
[40:57] him and was telling the people to go and
[41:01] get a
[41:02] l for what for
[41:06] sacrifice why because the angel that was
[41:09] going to pass that
[41:11] night it was looking for something
[41:16] specific it was something that had to
[41:19] identify a
[41:22] household with the message that had been
[41:25] preached that was the
[41:27] token praise the Lord so he told them go
[41:30] and kill the
[41:31] lamb bring this lamb kill it and then
[41:35] apply the blood on the door
[41:37] post praise the name of the Living God
[41:40] and so it did not
[41:42] matter how much of this message you
[41:46] had if you had not applied the blood on
[41:48] the door
[41:50] post this could hit your
[41:53] house praise the Lord and now this is
[41:55] where the Prophet calls it a
[41:58] separation separating The Believer from
[42:01] the
[42:03] unbeliever praise the Lord because they
[42:06] believe when they heard this word they
[42:09] believed it and theyken to this what and
[42:13] they went into their
[42:15] fields they got the Lambs killed them
[42:19] and applied the blood and they believed
[42:23] on what Moses had told
[42:25] them of whether it was coming to pass or
[42:28] not they believed it and applied the
[42:32] token praise the Lord and now in verse
[42:37] 13 it says and the blood shall be to you
[42:41] for a token upon the houses where you
[42:47] are and when I pass around this
[42:51] night and when I shall see that
[42:54] identification of the blood
[42:58] when I shall see that
[43:00] token I will pass over you and the plag
[43:04] shall not
[43:05] hit it shall not destroy you when I made
[43:09] the land of
[43:11] Egypt praise the Living God so now those
[43:14] that obey the
[43:15] voice did according to what Moses
[43:19] said presented their
[43:22] token and they were saved from the
[43:25] death
[43:26] living so now in this scripture we
[43:30] notice that the things that were done in
[43:32] the Old
[43:34] Testament are perfect Shadows of the
[43:36] things that we are to be in the New
[43:39] Testament the instructions that God gave
[43:42] to the children of Israel in the Old
[43:46] Testament perfect Shadows of the things
[43:49] that we are to
[43:51] come praise the lord we know we see that
[43:54] in the Old Testament in the Garden of
[43:58] Eden when Eve and Adam had committed
[44:02] sin God did not reject
[44:06] them but God identified the lamb for
[44:11] himself he killed this slam what was he
[44:14] looking for he was looking for a token
[44:17] to be
[44:18] applied that when this lamb was
[44:21] killed it died praise the Lord out blood
[44:27] and blood came out of it lost his life
[44:31] into that
[44:33] blood was
[44:35] ight the sin of Adam and his wife were
[44:39] covered and that was the token that God
[44:43] was identifying in their day and when it
[44:46] comes now to the children of
[44:48] Israel when they were in bondage when
[44:51] God wanted to redeem them when God
[44:55] wanted to save
[44:57] when God wanted to change their
[44:59] environment what he did after he had
[45:02] sent the message over and
[45:05] over and Pharaoh had rejected it he now
[45:10] instructed
[45:11] Moses he said I know
[45:15] something that is a part of me that must
[45:19] be identified with by every
[45:21] believer and that was the blood praise
[45:25] the Lord so he told them go and kill the
[45:29] wise
[45:30] Egyptians who could have believed on
[45:33] this
[45:33] message as long as they applied this
[45:37] token they were saved from the
[45:40] plague praise the Lord and now this same
[45:44] message we see that he presents to us
[45:47] this
[45:48] token which is the blood that is coming
[45:52] out of a
[45:53] sacrifice the lamb that has died
[45:56] and that blood much as it was play on
[45:59] the door
[46:01] post as long as it was applied there it
[46:05] was a symbol that God could identify
[46:08] himself
[46:09] with to save whichever houseold
[46:13] hard praise the Living God and now the
[46:16] prophet says about this token it says
[46:20] and God required a token from
[46:24] them this token was an innocent
[46:29] L that he had substituted for
[46:33] death and now when the lamb was
[46:36] killed the blood was to be placed upon
[46:39] the
[46:41] doorpost and on the
[46:43] L and it was to show that the
[46:46] requirement had been carried
[46:52] out praise the Lord that blood that
[46:56] token was a
[46:59] requirement it was to show that the
[47:02] requirement has been
[47:06] apply and says this was going
[47:11] separate and make a difference between
[47:14] those who were going out of
[47:17] Egypt and those who were going to stay
[47:20] in Egypt and perish with
[47:24] Egypt the
[47:26] difference praise the Lord and that's
[47:30] what he was requiring that
[47:33] night to separate the
[47:36] Believers from the
[47:38] unbelievers the believer worshiper was
[47:41] identified with his
[47:44] sacrifice he must apply the
[47:47] blood praise the lord we are laying a
[47:50] foundation for something
[47:52] tonight and it says it wasn't take and
[47:56] kill the
[48:00] lamb set the blood out there
[48:04] somewhere keep it in a
[48:07] charger or take it down to the
[48:10] neighbors he had to apply the
[48:13] blood that's the way it is
[48:16] tonight we could come and sympathize
[48:19] with everything God
[48:22] does that that isn't what he requires
[48:26] you've got to apply
[48:28] it it's not sufficient until you apply
[48:33] it the blood must be
[48:37] applied that shows that you are
[48:41] identified praise the Lord and we see
[48:45] that in the Old
[48:47] Testament when one was convicted of
[48:51] sin praise the Lord there have been
[48:53] given instructions
[48:56] praise the Lord that they go
[48:58] out and get a lamb praise the Lord or
[49:03] get a
[49:05] sacrifice and then bring it before the
[49:09] priest and then the person who was
[49:13] convicted and wanted to reconcile
[49:15] themselves with
[49:17] God they had to lay their hands upon the
[49:21] sacrifice the sacrifice was
[49:24] killed in other words the person had to
[49:28] be
[49:29] identified with the
[49:31] sacrifice praise the Lord said that when
[49:34] blood is coming
[49:36] out unless the sacrifice is losing his
[49:40] life by way of losing its blood and when
[49:44] that blood is
[49:46] applied the sins of the person are
[49:49] covered what was that it was a token
[49:53] praise the Lord it was an instruction
[49:56] that God gave to whoever wanted to be
[49:58] reconciled back to
[50:01] himself we find that Inus
[50:05] verse4 it says and he shall put his hand
[50:08] upon the head of the bur
[50:12] offering and it shall be accepted for
[50:14] him to make atonement for
[50:17] him and that exactly what we do
[50:21] tonight the prophet says we lay our
[50:24] faith upon the sacrifice
[50:27] which is the word of God which is Jesus
[50:31] Christ praise the Lord and out of him
[50:35] comes the Eternal token of
[50:39] God says what we are doing
[50:42] tonight is to lay our faith upon that
[50:46] sacrifice is to lay our faith upon Jesus
[50:50] Christ praise the Lord which sacrifice
[50:53] was offered for our sins
[50:57] and out of him when he was being offered
[51:00] as a l for
[51:02] sacrifice he was on the cross and blood
[51:06] was dripping out of him when he was
[51:09] losing his
[51:11] life and the blood was being
[51:13] applied and out of that blood came
[51:16] life which is our Eternal
[51:19] token Holy Spirit praise the Lord so the
[51:23] prophet says we simply have to p put our
[51:25] faith upon that
[51:28] Sacrifice by way of believing his words
[51:32] by way of believing the word of
[51:34] God because the word of God is Jesus
[51:38] Christ himself which is the
[51:41] sacrifice that God gave for us that out
[51:45] of him comes eternal life out of him
[51:50] comes the Holy Spirit which is the
[51:54] seal the the day of our Redemption out
[51:57] of Jesus Christ comes the token which we
[52:01] must apply the token of the Holy Spirit
[52:05] now when that day comes the oncoming
[52:10] storm which we know surely shall come we
[52:14] were teaching about it in the morning
[52:16] that there is coming a day when the
[52:19] entire Earth shall burn as an
[52:21] oven praise the Lord and when that day
[52:25] come
[52:26] there is only one thing only one
[52:29] requirement that God demands of us that
[52:33] is the token of the Holy Spirit the life
[52:36] of God in
[52:38] us no matter how much you've listen
[52:41] to No matter how much you
[52:44] believe without that token you shall be
[52:48] left but as long as the token is there
[52:52] when the angel is
[52:54] passing sees the token he says I will
[52:57] pass over you praise the Lord and now
[53:01] this time the angel shall not pass over
[53:04] us to leave us on the Earth but when the
[53:07] Archangel
[53:09] sounds when the Trump of the Lord
[53:11] sounds praise the Lord and now we shall
[53:15] be identified with
[53:17] him why because we have that life the
[53:21] token of God the Holy Spirit praise the
[53:25] Lord
[53:25] that is the requirement that he needs of
[53:28] us that's the requirement that every
[53:31] believing Christian must have in order
[53:34] to enter into the
[53:35] rupture praise the lord we are a blessed
[53:39] person we are blessed people we have all
[53:42] the
[53:43] secrets brought down to us we have all
[53:47] the
[53:48] secrets unto us praise the lord we don't
[53:52] need to go praying and
[53:54] fasting crying and running up and above
[53:58] in order to receive the Holy Spirit it
[54:00] is simply obedience to the
[54:03] words obedience to the
[54:05] word you receive the Holy Spirit and
[54:09] this Holy Spirit in our age is what God
[54:13] is looking out for why because this Holy
[54:17] Spirit comes out of Christ the Lamb of
[54:21] God that was offered for a sacrifice
[54:25] this holy spirit that is our s of
[54:28] redemption this holy spirit that is our
[54:32] protection praise the name of the Living
[54:34] God so now the one who wanted to be
[54:38] reconciled needed a
[54:40] token which was the
[54:43] sacrifice out of which blood came out so
[54:46] now what is the token the token is a
[54:49] symbol that a price has been
[54:54] paid it's a symbol that something has
[54:57] been
[54:58] accomplished the term token is often
[55:01] used to
[55:03] refer to a visible
[55:05] sign or a symbol that represents a
[55:08] deeper
[55:18] spiritual Ser as tangible reminders of
[55:21] God's
[55:24] promises
[55:26] praise the Lord there are tangible
[55:29] reminders praise the Lord of God's
[55:33] promises God his Covenant and his acts
[55:36] of redemption we've seen that in the
[55:40] Garden of
[55:41] Eden in the Garden of Eden he killed a
[55:44] lamb and blood was applied that was a
[55:47] token that was a covenant and we also
[55:51] see that after God had stray the face of
[55:54] the Earth
[55:56] floods praise the Lord that when all was
[56:00] done he still came out and when he
[56:04] looked at at Noah he sympathized with
[56:08] him praise the Lord and He repented to
[56:12] himself and he says I shall never
[56:14] destroy the Earth with
[56:16] floods he did not end there he gave a
[56:20] covenant praise the Lord he gave a token
[56:24] which was the
[56:26] the Lord that each time man an
[56:30] God andever they have
[56:33] committed when God attempts to
[56:36] destroy he remembers his Covenant he
[56:40] remembers his token because he is a God
[56:44] who is faithful to his promises so he
[56:46] gave Noah a token of the symbol which
[56:50] was the physical
[56:52] symbol of the
[56:53] rainbow each time he's annoyed he says I
[56:57] will not when the S appears up there and
[57:01] he looks at it he repents himself and
[57:04] says I will not destroy man that was a
[57:07] conval reality it is a token that God
[57:12] gave praise the Lord and now we see now
[57:16] in the times of of
[57:18] Moses when now he was pulling them out
[57:21] of
[57:22] bondage praise the Lord when was going
[57:25] to Smite the land of Egypt he also
[57:28] identified himself with a
[57:31] token praise the Lord and he put it up
[57:34] there and he was Dy
[57:37] bound to respect his
[57:40] token Duty bound to give respect to his
[57:43] token and now when he saw it because it
[57:47] is the
[57:48] instruction it is the requirement that
[57:51] he
[57:51] needed when he saw it he passed over and
[57:56] he kept his promise prise and now in
[58:00] this our day the token that we
[58:04] have is the Holy Spirit the token that
[58:07] we have is the life of God
[58:10] himself even Jesus Christ and as long as
[58:14] you have that
[58:15] token death has no power over you as
[58:19] long as you have that token sickness has
[58:22] no power over
[58:23] you
[58:25] which is the reality of the Covenant of
[58:28] God which is our
[58:30] protection that token the life of Jesus
[58:34] Christ which came out of his blood when
[58:36] he passed on
[58:38] Calvary praise the Lord he is our
[58:41] protection praise the Living God and the
[58:44] prophet says about the
[58:45] token in the message
[58:48] desperations he says the
[58:50] token is the sign that the blood has
[58:53] been applied
[58:55] that the price has been
[58:58] asked it has been
[59:01] asked required of God then Jesus Paid
[59:05] that
[59:06] price by shedding his own
[59:09] blood did that then from his
[59:13] life came the Holy
[59:16] Spirit and when the blood is applied to
[59:19] you when the blood is applied to
[59:22] you the Holy Spirit is a
[59:26] token that your price is
[59:29] paid that God has received
[59:32] you that is the token remember that is
[59:36] the
[59:37] token praise the Lord then he says then
[59:40] the
[59:41] life that was in
[59:44] Christ is the Holy Ghost not the third
[59:48] person but the same person in the form
[59:50] of the Holy
[59:52] Spirit coming down upon
[59:55] you as a token that your life and your
[59:59] fa is
[1:00:01] paid you have been
[1:00:05] accepted and until that token
[1:00:09] comes you are not
[1:00:12] permitted praise the Lord he says that
[1:00:16] token the Holy Spirit it is the Holy
[1:00:20] Ghost which is the Life of Christ which
[1:00:24] he gave unto the church the scriptures
[1:00:27] say all that God
[1:00:31] was he poured it into Christ and all
[1:00:35] that
[1:00:36] Christ he poured it into the
[1:00:40] church form of the Holy Spirit which is
[1:00:43] your token to keep you until the day of
[1:00:47] your
[1:00:48] Redemption praise the Lord so now a
[1:00:51] token said is a physical symbol of
[1:00:54] Covenant
[1:00:56] between God and his
[1:00:57] people praise the Lord and we have seen
[1:01:00] that in the Book of Genesis chter
[1:01:04] 12 and God
[1:01:06] said this is the token of the
[1:01:09] Covenant which I make between me and
[1:01:12] you and every living
[1:01:15] creature that is with
[1:01:17] you for Perpetual
[1:01:21] Generations I do set my bow in the cloud
[1:01:25] I do set my b in the
[1:01:29] cloud and it shall be for a token of a
[1:01:35] covenant between me and
[1:01:38] you between me and the
[1:01:41] earth that is Genesis chter
[1:01:44] 9 we reading verse 13 now verse 14
[1:01:48] says and it shall come to
[1:01:52] pass and it shall come to pass
[1:01:56] when I bring a CL over the
[1:01:59] Earth that the shall be seen in
[1:02:04] the that's for
[1:02:06] token to remind God that he has a
[1:02:10] covenant with
[1:02:11] man then I will remember my
[1:02:15] Covenant which is between me and you and
[1:02:18] every living creature of All
[1:02:23] Flesh
[1:02:25] and the waters shall no more become a
[1:02:28] flood To Destroy All
[1:02:31] Flesh and the shall be in the
[1:02:34] cloud and I will look upon
[1:02:37] it praise the Lord to
[1:02:40] Moses he said let them apply the blood
[1:02:45] and when I look at it I will not destroy
[1:02:48] them pass them praise the Lord and now
[1:02:52] here to to Noah
[1:02:54] he says the B shall be in the
[1:02:58] cloud the boss shall be in the
[1:03:02] cloud and I will look upon
[1:03:05] it something God has to
[1:03:09] identify in order for God to save
[1:03:13] you he has put something for
[1:03:16] himself he shall
[1:03:18] identify praise the Lord that's why he
[1:03:21] has told Noah that when I look at it
[1:03:25] I remember the Everlasting Covenant
[1:03:27] between God and every living
[1:03:32] creature God said unto
[1:03:34] Noah this is the token of the
[1:03:37] Covenant which I have established
[1:03:39] between me and all the
[1:03:42] flesh he gave a token of
[1:03:45] Salvation praise the Lord and He Duty
[1:03:49] bound to protect that
[1:03:52] Covenant God is Duty bound
[1:03:54] to protect every Covenant that he makes
[1:03:57] with
[1:03:58] us he is
[1:04:00] bound to make sure that all the
[1:04:03] promises he has made come to
[1:04:07] fulfillment praise the Lord and now the
[1:04:10] token is also a symbol of God's
[1:04:14] protection yes sir it is what protects
[1:04:18] us because the Bible says it is your
[1:04:22] seal holy spirit is your
[1:04:25] seal not just your seal until the day of
[1:04:28] redemption
[1:04:30] only only waiting for the day of

[1:04:37] other words it's your
[1:04:40] Shield is your protection so the token

[1:24:05] land that you own it means you have
[1:24:10] somewhere that you are destined to be
[1:24:14] praise the Lord there were strangers and
[1:24:16] refuges in the
[1:24:17] land and they were moving onto the
[1:24:20] Promised
[1:24:21] Land strangers and refugees here on
[1:24:24] Earth praise the Lord and yes we T and
[1:24:29] suffer day and
[1:24:31] night but we have the
[1:24:33] expectation that there is a land where

[1:24:38] destined to be on
[1:24:40] earth no brother we are destined to be
[1:24:43] with Christ and we
[1:24:46] expectation just like a unexpecting
[1:24:49] mother we know that the day shall come

[1:24:56] showing that the day is
[1:24:59] coming when we shall be free from these
[1:25:03] bodies praise the Lord yes they
[1:25:07] groomed they were full of
[1:25:09] afflictions but we are sure of our
[1:25:12] promise praise the Lord they know that
[1:25:16] it was it wasn't their Eternal
[1:25:19] home Egypt wasn't
[1:25:23] position they hit Moses's
[1:25:27] message and that's what gave them their
[1:25:30] Redemption they hit the teachings of
[1:25:33] Moses and that's what brought their
[1:25:35] Redemption as long as you listen your
[1:25:39] messenger as long as you listen the
[1:25:41] voice that God has sent for your
[1:25:44] day and you get the instructions
[1:25:47] right praise the Lord and you believe
[1:25:50] every word right
[1:25:53] you must be set into
[1:25:55] expectation that
[1:25:57] someday you shall join
[1:26:00] Christ praise the Lord they hit Moses's
[1:26:04] message and we
[1:26:07] confident that was coming a change of
[1:26:11] system they were in
[1:26:13] expectation that there was a home that
[1:26:16] was
[1:26:17] coming there were bells ringing in their
[1:26:21] hearts
[1:26:23] there were bells of Joy ringing in their
[1:26:26] hearts regardless of the situations they
[1:26:29] were they were going
[1:26:31] through there were bells of Joy
[1:26:34] ringing that the suffering of this time
[1:26:37] is Just
[1:26:38] moment and it cannot be
[1:26:41] compared to that
[1:26:43] land which we have been promised which
[1:26:46] flows with milk and honey praise the
[1:26:49] Lord so now we see a change in the
[1:26:51] system
[1:26:53] and God when he had sent this
[1:26:56] message to not only take the message of
[1:26:59] the oncoming change of
[1:27:03] position but also of
[1:27:06] redemption they were not simply changing
[1:27:08] from the liberty of
[1:27:10] pharaoh they were being set to positions
[1:27:13] of
[1:27:15] Freedom praise the Lord and his message
[1:27:18] was
[1:27:19] clear crossing the people over to the
[1:27:21] land prepared
[1:27:23] for that that was the ultimate message
[1:27:26] of
[1:27:27] Moses the message has been
[1:27:30] given to to just to prepare you and to
[1:27:34] guide you over to the promised
[1:27:36] land and we are so grateful to God that
[1:27:40] he has given us the message of
[1:27:42] Malachi to not just prepare us but the
[1:27:46] same message shall lead us to the
[1:27:49] promised
[1:27:50] land praise the Lord and the
[1:27:54] message was we are going to the
[1:27:56] land that God has prepared in other
[1:28:00] words a predestinated land in which the
[1:28:04] system of leadership was
[1:28:06] different was God
[1:28:08] himself through His prophets that will
[1:28:12] lead them and it was purely
[1:28:15] God and only those with
[1:28:19] faith who believed Moses this message
[1:28:23] and recognize that Moses was a
[1:28:26] messenger the voice of God in their
[1:28:29] day received the
[1:28:31] grace to cross over because they applied
[1:28:35] the
[1:28:36] token and now because there was a change
[1:28:39] in the
[1:28:41] system there had to be a thing to define
[1:28:43] the Believers of that
[1:28:46] message that was the token of
[1:28:49] fa praise the Lord and when all was
[1:28:53] done and regardless of how Pharaoh was
[1:28:55] refusing to let them
[1:28:58] go Pharaoh referring the World
[1:29:02] Systems referring to the World
[1:29:05] Systems Pharaoh being liken the world

[1:29:27] captive PHA the Bens that don't want let
[1:29:31] the children of of God Escape
[1:29:36] captivity to change into their
[1:29:39] positions and take on to positions that
[1:29:41] God has ordained for
[1:29:43] them that he loves who are known before
[1:29:47] the world
[1:29:48] war Pharaoh referring to all all those
[1:29:52] burdens of
[1:29:57] captivity that want to hold us
[1:30:00] here but I want to bring our notice this
[1:30:03] evening that regardless of
[1:30:07] Pharaoh let him be praise the Lord let
[1:30:11] the captivities be let the burdens be as
[1:30:16] long as we have the
[1:30:18] token when the voice of the Lord shall

[1:30:24] these systems shall be
[1:30:27] broken and there shall be no any
[1:30:31] force that shall have power
[1:30:34] sufficient to hold our
[1:30:36] bodies hold us from being
[1:30:39] changed regardless of how much far
[1:30:43] F when the token was
[1:30:46] applied when the blood was
[1:30:49] applied and when the angel passed
[1:30:51] through
[1:30:53] the children of Israel were
[1:30:55] redeemed and the forces of pharaoh were
[1:30:59] broken systems that we are holding them
[1:31:02] back were
[1:31:04] broken he let them
[1:31:07] go praise the Lord he let them
[1:31:11] go there is no any amount of
[1:31:15] pressure that can hold us back there is
[1:31:19] no any amount of power
[1:31:22] that can hold a
[1:31:24] Believer when that time has
[1:31:26] come as long as we have that
[1:31:29] token praise the lord we got our promise
[1:31:32] as saints of
[1:31:34] God that in this

[1:32:59] changed yes we shall be
[1:33:02] changed when the voice of the
[1:33:06] trumpet shall locate

[1:33:32] token that shall cause a sudden change
[1:33:35] of our
[1:33:37] bodies which shall be
[1:33:39] ruptured for this
[1:33:42] corruptible must put on
[1:33:44] incorruptible and this moral must put on
[1:33:48] immortality is a promise and it must
[1:33:52] come to
[1:33:53] pass God never fails to fulfill his
[1:33:57] promises praise the Lord when this
[1:34:00] corruptible shall put on
[1:34:02] incorruption and this model shall have
[1:34:05] put on
[1:34:06] immortality then shall be brought to
[1:34:09] pass the saying that is
[1:34:12] written praise the Lord when you have
[1:34:15] passed from Death to
[1:34:17] life when you've crossed onto the other
[1:34:20] s the Bible says then there shall be
[1:34:24] made the
[1:34:25] saying that
[1:34:27] says death is sold up in
[1:34:31] Victory praise the Lord Moses when they
[1:34:35] looked back after God had led them
[1:34:38] through the the Red
[1:34:40] Sea and then they looked back and saw
[1:34:43] the Chariots and the armies of of
[1:34:46] of pharaoh destroyed the sea the Lord
[1:34:52] and they remembered how they were being
[1:34:55] tortured how they were being mistreated
[1:34:58] praise the Lord and they looked and they
[1:35:01] saw the mercies of
[1:35:03] God when we Cross by the other sight we
[1:35:06] shall look back to our bodies and see
[1:35:09] how much suffering you've gone through
[1:35:12] then shall have the power to
[1:35:14] save death where is your Victory praise

[1:35:19] Lord Death where is your vict
[1:35:22] so up in
[1:35:24] Victory where is your victory for the

[1:36:18] has no power over you you will now know
[1:36:21] all those

[1:37:33] word God said once you obey his word
[1:37:37] being
[1:37:38] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he
[1:37:41] gives you the Holy Spirit and that Holy
[1:37:44] Spirit is what God shall call out on
[1:37:49] that day God
[1:37:51] when the bridegroom
[1:37:53] came when the when the trumpet was
[1:37:56] sounded and all the virgins woke
[1:37:59] up praise the Lord the only thing that

[2:30:29] Corinthians chapter
[2:30:32] 11 verse
[2:30:34] 26 Hallelujah rather verse 23 let us
[2:30:39] start from
[2:30:44] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[2:30:48] which also I delivered to you that the
[2:30:51] Lord
[2:30:52] Jesus the same night in which he was
[2:30:57] betrayed took
[2:31:12] bread and when he had given thanks he
[2:31:16] broke it and said take eat this is my
[2:31:22] body which is broken for you this do in
[2:31:27] remembrance of
[2:31:42] me after the same manner oh also he took
[2:31:47] the cup when he had sapped saying this
[2:31:52] is the New
[2:31:53] Testament in my
[2:31:56] blood this do you as
[2:32:00] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[2:32:15] me
[2:32:20] hallelujah hallelujah then verse 26
[2:32:23] which we read is it for as often as you
[2:32:27] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[2:32:33] show the Lord's death till he
[2:32:45] comes
[2:32:48] so that's how important so important it
[2:32:52] is that it takes us
[2:32:55] back to think and remember and
[2:33:00] meditate how he gave himself for a
[2:33:04] sacrifice so that he may release the
[2:33:08] token token he
[2:33:11] released it was he gave his
[2:33:14] ghost Hallelujah Hallelujah and then
[2:33:17] when he gave his
[2:33:18] ghost that
[2:33:20] Spirit came searching for
[2:33:23] you seeking for you so that he may seal
[2:33:28] you
[2:33:29] in sealing you in
[2:33:34] him you in him and him in you hallelujah
[2:33:40] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[2:33:42] and then verse
[2:33:45] 27
[2:33:46] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:33:49] and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:33:53] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:33:56] and blood of the
[2:34:11] Lord
[2:34:14] amen let it sink in your
[2:34:17] heart you should not take it
[2:34:20] unworthily should not take
[2:34:23] it what do we mean by

[2:34:36] Christ for you to enter into
[2:34:40] him and for him to enter into
