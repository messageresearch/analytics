[16:17] when we are hosting him on Sunday that's
[16:19] on 15th
[16:22] we shall be inviting other papers new
[16:25] pastors and the pastors around us
[16:32] we shall be expecting about 300 plus
[16:35] people around
[16:38] and now we need to prepare a meal for
[16:41] all the people
[16:44] praise the name of Allah and so it is
[16:47] good when people visit you you feed them
[16:50] so I'm requesting
[16:53] to give your contributions
[16:56] for that meeting with the male to
[16:59] brother Peter aula
[17:02] I was asking him in the course of the
[17:05] week
[17:06] and then he said they are not received
[17:08] anything yeah
[17:10] so two weeks which even we need to raise
[17:13] one and a half million Shillings
[17:21] I know we have not paid school fees for
[17:24] children some of us
[17:27] the month has come to an end so the
[17:29] landlord is knocking
[17:32] but the things of God
[17:35] told Elijah
[17:37] go to that Widow
[17:40] and the Widow Was preparing the last
[17:43] meal
[17:46] prepare it for me first
[17:50] now if she was to eat that last meal
[17:53] alone
[18:27] different churches of the denominations
[18:30] and so yesterday we collected quite a
[18:33] number of them about three groups
[18:37] over 100 people there
[18:40] by then we baptized 96 people in number
[18:43] two months
[18:47] and then I just remembered
[18:50] at that time when I was still there
[18:53] yesterday I I shared the photographs now
[18:58] now I sent the photographs on the
[19:00] WhatsApp of the church
[19:03] and then I think it was just I think
[19:05] about after certain minutes
[19:18] and I want to appreciate that
[19:22] and I remember yesterday
[19:25] we have churches we've opened up to the
[19:28] message in Western Uganda
[19:38] at the beginning of the year
[19:42] it has been sending different people to
[19:45] go there so there's a particular pasta
[19:51] who has got now the burden to reach out
[19:54] to different churches
[19:56] foreign
[20:58] and then now when I was asking him how
[21:01] much money it would need to transport
[21:02] this before baptism
[21:06] it was 230 000. and then your brother in
[21:11] the time of need sent two hundred
[21:13] thousand
[21:14] organization
[21:16] so I just got all that money and sent it
[21:20] to the pastor who is ministering there
[21:22] that you can baptize the people today
[21:27] so this is really what happens
[21:30] you know you spend here you spend here
[21:33] but you're not spending in vain
[21:37] because if we can recognize that
[21:41] whatever we have
[21:43] we are giving of it of the Lord and so
[21:46] if I receive it and they return it back
[21:51] then you're multiplying what you're
[21:53] going through
[21:54] praise the name of Allah I just
[21:56] encourage you to learn how to give up
[22:00] learn how to give giving your life
[22:04] you have given your life to Christ
[22:07] but what about what you have you learn
[22:10] how to put back into the Kingdom
[22:15] so I was really very happy by what
[22:18] brother Nassau did and it excited
[22:22] praise the name of Allah now this
[22:26] morning
[22:27] our sister Francis
[22:31] she's the wife of brother Wilson Italian
[22:35] her father passed away at Milagro
[22:37] hospital
[22:40] so now they are we shall get the burial
[22:44] arrangements
[22:46] and would really call upon support to
[22:49] the family
[22:51] and even those who were able to travel
[22:53] for the burial when we get the right
[22:55] date
[22:56] District
[23:00] the value may be in the symbol of the
[23:02] district
[23:03] yesterday so just calling upon you to
[23:06] really give that kind of support right
[23:08] because
[23:09] praise the name of our Lord and even
[23:11] encouraging our sister
[23:13] is the name of our Lord now after the
[23:16] service I said we have only one service
[23:20] but there are forms we are going to give
[23:22] out if you can put them there just
[23:25] foreign
[23:30] the form of Agape voice of God adapted
[23:35] advice of good
[23:37] I want it to be broadcasted so that you
[23:39] know what we're going to get it
[23:45] I had wanted to give it last Sunday
[23:48] but I Saw the Rains affected many people
[23:51] from coming in time perform
[24:04] so there is that form where we which is
[24:06] going to be given to the family
[24:10] now if you don't have a family here then
[24:13] you can receive it from yourself
[24:17] and then you'll have to feel the
[24:19] information that's needed
[24:21] indicating the funny number the language

[24:28] and then your home church somewhere
[24:31] and we shall need these forms maybe
[24:34] you'll return them next Sunday

[24:42] want to give for evangelism

[24:50] it shows baptism in the name of Jesus
[24:54] Christ

[24:59] historical books
[25:02] then there is also baptism by imagine
[25:06] how it was done in much water
[25:10] and we have enough forms for every one
[25:13] of us

[27:01] with all the needs of your children
[27:04] the name of the Lord Jesus
[27:09] let us go to Matthew chapter 25 yeah
[27:16] Matthew 25 Matthew we are reading from
[27:20] verse 1 to verse 10.
[27:24] the scripture says
[27:28] then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[27:30] likened unto 10 virgins which took their
[27:33] lamps and went forth to meet the
[27:36] bridegroom
[27:38] foreign
[28:02] took their lambs and took no oil with
[28:06] them
[28:07] foreign
[28:15] but the wines took all in their vessels
[28:18] with their lamps
[28:24] UPA
[28:30] much
[28:33] [Music]
[28:35] while the bridegroom Target they all
[28:38] slumbered and slept
[28:43] foreign
[28:47] and at midnight there was a crime made
[28:50] behold the bridegroom Comics going out
[28:54] to meet him
[29:02] then
[29:05] all those virgins arose and trimmed
[29:09] their lamps and they've and the foolish
[29:11] said unto the wise give us of your oil
[29:14] for our lamps are gone out
[29:17] foreign
[29:51] foreign
[29:56] foreign
[30:02] and while they went to buy the
[30:04] bridegroom came and they that were
[30:07] already went in with him to the marriage
[30:09] and the door was shut
[30:12] up again yeah
[30:23] foreign
[30:49] so today we want to share on the token
[30:54] of the Third Exodus
[31:00] the token of the sad Exodus
[31:06] now in the message of the hour
[31:11] brother Branham identifies three
[31:14] exoduses
[31:17] and the first Exodus
[31:20] was The Exodus which was led by Moses
[31:26] when they were leaving the land of Egypt
[31:30] to the land of the promise
[31:35] and in that Exodus before they left the
[31:39] land of Egypt
[31:42] God gave them a token
[31:46] which they had to use
[31:48] in order to go to the land of the
[31:51] promise
[31:55] then again there was the second Exodus
[31:59] and that Exodus
[32:02] was led by the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:06] where he was leading the Jews
[32:09] you know from the religious systems of
[32:13] the day
[32:15] he told the baptism of the holy spirit
[32:20] so then they are God also gave them a
[32:23] token
[32:25] and now we are in the Third Exodus
[32:34] is God is calling a bride
[32:39] out of the denomination system
[32:43] and as he calls the bride out of the
[32:46] denominational system
[32:49] he gives them his very life
[32:54] and the life of Christ
[32:57] is the token today
[33:00] the Life of Christ
[33:02] is the token of this Exodus
[33:06] the life of Jesus Christ is the token of
[33:11] the Third Exodus
[33:13] and now this life of Jesus Christ
[33:19] to go into the Rapture this life of
[33:22] Jesus Christ we will change our bodies
[33:34] now we see here in the scriptures
[33:38] when we go to Exodus chapter three
[33:41] and we look at the first Exodus
[33:46] in Exodus chapter 3
[33:50] and then verse
[33:53] the scripture says
[33:57] now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[34:00] father-in-law the priest of median and
[34:03] he led the Flop to the back side of the
[34:06] desert and came to the Mountain of God
[34:09] even Hebron
[34:11] says whatever
[34:24] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[34:26] him in the flame of fire out of the
[34:29] midst of a bush and he looked and behold
[34:32] the bush bound with fire and the Bush
[34:35] was not consummed Saka
[34:42] Nola
[34:51] and Moses said I'll now turn aside and
[34:55] see this great sign why the bush is not
[34:58] banned
[35:09] and when the Lord saw that he turned
[35:12] aside to see God called unto him out of
[35:15] the midst of the Bush and said Moses
[35:18] Moses and he said here am I okay
[35:40] and he said don't not deny either put
[35:44] off thy shoes from of thy feet for the
[35:47] place where on those standeth is Holy
[35:50] grounded
[36:01] [Music]
[36:04] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[36:08] father the god of Abraham the god of
[36:11] Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[36:15] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[36:18] God
[36:22] watch musan
[36:35] [Music]
[36:40] Affliction of my people which are in
[36:43] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[36:45] of their task Masters for I know their
[36:49] sorrows
[36:51] um
[37:05] and I am come down to deliver them out
[37:08] of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[37:10] bring them up out of the land unto a
[37:13] good land and a large unto a land
[37:15] flowing with milk and honey and to the
[37:18] place of the Canaanites and the Hittites
[37:21] and the amorites and the parasites and
[37:24] the heavites and the jebusites City
[37:31] a
[37:46] nature
[37:53] now they are for Behold The Crying of
[37:56] the children of Israel is come unto me
[37:58] and I have also seen the oppression
[38:01] where with the Egyptians or president
[38:08] foreign
[38:19] that thou must bring forth my people the
[38:22] children of Israel out of Egypt Allah
[38:29] foreign
[38:35] and
[38:38] [Music]
[38:41] that I should bring forth the children
[38:44] of Israel out of Egypt
[38:47] US city
[38:57] and he said certainly I will be with
[39:00] thee and this shall be that
[39:12] amen praise the name of our Lord I mean
[39:15] that was the first Exodus
[39:18] when God was calling the children of
[39:21] Israel
[39:24] from Egypt to the land of promise
[39:28] foreign
[40:11] and you know like Moses was grazing the
[40:15] animals on that here
[40:18] I mean you maybe was the only person
[40:20] grazing in that place
[40:22] and then he started wondering I've not
[40:25] liten a candle yeah
[40:27] I've not put any fire anywhere
[40:30] then who is this person who can light
[40:33] this thing
[40:34] so it took his interest
[40:37] and then he saw the fire burning
[40:40] but then the the bush is not consumed
[40:44] then he wondered and you see God was
[40:48] taking drawing his attention
[40:50] and many times also God wants to draw
[40:54] our attention
[40:58] God wants to do our attention to him
[41:03] and then now when Moses reached there
[41:22] so God himself came down and then he
[41:26] started speaking to Moses
[41:29] and then we see that it was the pillar
[41:32] of fire
[41:33] that led the children of Israel
[41:36] out of Egypt even from through the
[41:40] Wilderness up to the land of the promise
[41:44] so God himself come down
[41:48] praise the name of our Lord he came down
[41:51] as the angel of the convenience
[41:54] praise the name of the Lord he came down
[41:57] to lead The Exodus
[41:59] and then we see here
[42:02] that God
[42:04] manifested himself tomorrow
[42:40] you know there are some things you hear
[42:42] and then you start wondering why are
[42:44] this happening
[42:47] praise the name of our Lord so much
[42:50] immorality
[42:51] so much more you know wickedness
[42:54] even things you wouldn't want to imagine
[42:58] or things you wouldn't speak about
[43:01] praise the name of Allah like just in
[43:04] the course of this week
[43:06] you know there is a person who believed
[43:09] the message
[43:11] from one of the churches
[43:17] I've seen brother malavia welcome but in
[43:20] all Uganda you're welcome to be with us
[43:23] praise the name of our Lord so now what
[43:26] happened
[43:27] these people are coming for the services
[43:29] we have every every Thursday
[43:34] and so even this sister came and then
[43:37] she wanted to talk to me
[43:40] and then now when she was talking
[43:43] you know she was you know saying things
[43:48] which she has been subjected to yeah
[43:55] and you know you wouldn't want to
[43:57] believe something
[44:00] but you can see how immoral people can
[44:03] be
[44:05] until the husband
[44:09] start sodomizing his wife
[44:24] and then she said that you know then
[44:27] when she dreamed
[44:32] when the husband was doing this kind of
[44:35] thing
[44:36] she went and she was standing up and all
[44:39] the human race was running out yeah
[44:43] foreign
[45:43] lot of wickedness
[45:46] until everything even at places of work
[45:51] truth is not really wanted
[45:54] they want dubious things
[45:57] you know they want things of cheating
[46:00] and then you find that your place
[46:04] becomes like Sodom and Gomorrah
[46:07] like a lot was in Sodom and Gomorrah and
[46:11] then the scripture says that the heart
[46:14] of Lords
[46:16] was fixed
[46:23] by what he saw and by what he had and
[46:29] you see at places of work you see what
[46:32] people do you hear what people say and
[46:37] then you find the environment is no
[46:39] longer good to living as a Christian
[46:41] everything
[46:43] thing is being dubious
[46:46] even the one who is meant to monitor is
[46:48] dubious
[46:52] you know everything no clear line
[46:56] they said this then they do something
[46:58] different
[46:59] it is another condition of bondage
[47:05] in Egypt
[47:07] and now we see the spiritual conditions
[47:11] so that is taking place it may be a
[47:15] bondage at your home it may be a bondage
[47:18] at a place
[47:23] look what the diseases you know that are
[47:26] getting a hold of the people
[47:29] look what the religious systems how
[47:32] corrupt it has become
[47:35] bondage in every condition
[47:37] so God sends another Exodus in our time
[47:41] praise the name of Allah
[48:14] and then verse
[48:17] the scripture says and the Lord spoken
[48:21] to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
[48:23] saying
[48:29] this month shall be unto you the
[48:32] beginning of mass it shall be the first
[48:35] month of the year to you
[48:37] foreign
[49:02] foreign
[49:28] let him and his neighbor next unto his
[49:32] house take it according to the number of
[49:35] souls every man according to his eating
[49:38] shall make your count for the lamp
[49:49] foreign
[50:24] foreign
[50:40] and you shall keep it until the 14th day
[50:43] of the same month and the whole assembly
[50:46] of the congregation of Israel shall kill
[50:49] it in the evening
[50:57] foreign
[51:15] of the houses wherein you shall eat it
[51:29] foreign
[51:34] and they shall eat the Flesh in that
[51:37] night and roast with fire and unleavened
[51:41] bread and with bitter herbs they shall
[51:43] eat it
[52:00] not a vitro nor a sudden at all with
[52:04] water but roast with fire his head with
[52:08] his legs and with the patiness thereof
[52:13] on Amazon
[52:26] and you shall let nothing of it remain
[52:28] until the morning and that which
[52:30] remaineth of it until the morning you
[52:33] shall burn with fire engine
[52:46] and that shall you eat it with your
[52:49] loins guarded your shoes on your feet
[52:51] and your stuff in your hand and you
[52:54] shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[52:57] Passover
[53:15] foreign
[53:22] of Egypt both man and Beast and against
[53:26] all gods of Egypt I will execute
[53:29] judgment for I am the Lord and the blood
[53:32] shall be unto for a token upon the
[53:35] houses where you are and when I see the
[53:38] blood I will pass over you and the
[53:41] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[53:44] you when I smite the land of Egypt
[53:47] foreign
[53:58] foreign
[55:17] you shall sacrifice it so there were
[55:20] four days of checking the the lamp is
[55:23] perfect
[55:26] praise the name of Allah and then we see
[55:29] also our Lord Jesus Christ
[55:32] the scripture tells us in First
[55:36] Corinthians chapter 5
[55:40] and then we read in verse 7
[55:44] he says Purge out there for the old
[55:48] living
[55:49] that you may be a new lamp as you are
[55:53] unleavened for even Christ Our Passover
[55:57] is sacrificed for us
[56:00] is
[56:09] a
[56:19] so Christ is our past of alarm
[56:24] so when they were sacrificing that lamb
[56:27] in Exodus chapter 12.
[56:31] they were showing the coming of the Lord
[56:34] Jesus Christ
[56:36] is our Passover Lamb Christian
[56:39] here the lamb was required to be without
[56:43] any blame
[56:46] it was not the sinner it was not the
[56:50] people but the people were told take the
[56:53] lamb
[56:54] check the sacrifice
[56:57] praise the name of Allah and then it was
[57:00] the sacrifice that was checked
[57:03] but the worshiper was required to take
[57:08] the perfect animals
[57:12] perfect sacrifice foreign
[58:19] Christ became our sins
[58:23] and then we take the righteousness of
[58:26] God
[58:27] by receiving our Lord Jesus Christ
[58:30] and this is what the token really does
[58:34] hear the talking was for you to apply
[58:37] the blood of a perfect sacrifice
[58:41] and that's what the Lord wanted them to
[58:43] do
[58:44] apply the blood and even now we need to
[58:49] apply the blood but the blood is not the
[58:53] chemistry
[58:55] because out of the blood
[58:57] comes the life you know the Bible tells
[59:01] us when we got the Book of Leviticus
[59:04] chapter 17.
[59:08] and then we read in verse 11.
[59:13] for the life of the flesh is in the
[59:16] blood
[59:17] and I have given it to you upon the
[59:19] altar to make an atonement for your
[59:22] souls for it is the blood that makes a
[59:26] tournament for the soul
[59:29] Leviticus 17 11.
[59:36] Yama
[59:39] um
[59:52] praise the name of our Lord he says I
[59:55] have given you the blood
[59:59] upon the altar praise the name of Allah
[1:00:04] upon the altar of your heart
[1:00:07] I have given you the blood and out of
[1:00:11] the blood comes the light
[1:00:14] so when you apply the Life of Christ
[1:00:18] I've turned your heart then the Judgment
[1:00:22] passes away from you
[1:00:24] praise the name of Allah
[1:00:27] you know produces the life
[1:00:30] so now physically they were applying the
[1:00:33] blood
[1:00:34] but spiritually the life was the one
[1:00:37] which was going uh
[1:01:01] on the day of Pentecost the blood came
[1:01:05] back
[1:01:06] upon the worshiper
[1:01:09] and then you know the token was applied
[1:01:12] upon their lives
[1:01:14] and then we see her that in the Old
[1:01:16] Testament they applied the blood on the
[1:01:19] doorsteps
[1:01:21] you know they put the blood and when the
[1:01:24] angel was passing back
[1:01:26] and he saw the blood there was no
[1:01:30] destruction in that house and it's also
[1:01:33] the same thing also now we need to apply
[1:01:36] the blood
[1:01:37] Upon Our Hearts praise the name of our
[1:01:41] Lord we need to apply the blood
[1:02:41] upon your house
[1:02:53] and maybe you are living in a community
[1:02:56] praise the name of our Lord you know
[1:02:59] most of our communities we live in
[1:03:02] they have different names
[1:03:04] and then you go to a village around here
[1:03:06] yeah
[1:03:08] and then they call it
[1:03:11] then you know okutamira is the order of
[1:03:14] the day there what a guarantee drunk
[1:03:16] drunkenness that is the spirit that
[1:03:19] lures
[1:03:21] then you go to another Village they also
[1:03:25] have another funny name
[1:03:28] you know and then they have names of
[1:03:30] ghosts
[1:03:32] or names of you know funny things
[1:03:35] names of murderers
[1:03:38] you know there is another Village
[1:03:40] somewhere in kamory I'm just forgetting
[1:03:43] the name but as you go to namuela and
[1:03:47] they said that village with the
[1:03:50] Witchcraft
[1:03:53] very famous for that but she didn't
[1:03:55] always but even if you come from that
[1:03:57] Village
[1:03:58] and you applied the blood of Jesus
[1:04:01] Christ upon your heart God will protect
[1:04:04] you from those things
[1:04:07] even us now in the end time
[1:04:11] the devil has released these gates of
[1:04:13] hell
[1:04:14] but you need to apply the blood of Jesus
[1:04:17] Christ
[1:04:19] and you'll be safe and secure from
[1:04:30] and then he says by holding to the word
[1:04:33] of God
[1:04:34] foreign
[1:05:02] Psalms 119 and then verse 9 Academy
[1:05:06] the scripture says
[1:05:09] shall a young man cleanse his way
[1:05:17] why because there's a lot of that
[1:05:22] there is a lot of immorality there is a
[1:05:26] lot of evil so he says how are you going
[1:05:29] to cleanse your way
[1:05:31] you know when the Bible asks a question
[1:05:34] it gives the answer and it says by
[1:05:37] taking heed there to according to your
[1:05:40] words
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:06:00] you just need the blood of Jesus
[1:06:03] apply the blood of Jesus at your place
[1:06:06] of work apply the blood of Jesus at the
[1:06:10] place of your studies apply the blood of
[1:06:13] Jesus in your house apply the blood of
[1:06:17] Jesus
[1:06:19] you know there are some places where
[1:06:21] there are people who don't want others
[1:06:24] to developers
[1:06:27] you know when you start digging the
[1:06:29] foundation they start throwing their
[1:06:32] witchcraft
[1:06:33] apply the blood of Jesus Christ praise
[1:06:37] the name of our Lord then there are some
[1:06:39] families
[1:06:40] maybe they are core wives
[1:06:45] um
[1:06:51] foreign
[1:07:19] apply the blood of Jesus Christ the name
[1:07:23] of Allah you know so the blood
[1:07:26] is our protection
[1:07:28] praise the name of our Lord how do you
[1:07:31] apply the blood of Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ by the word of God
[1:07:37] and the word of prayer
[1:07:40] you committed to the Lord you call upon
[1:07:44] the name of the Lord you are applying
[1:07:47] the blood of Jesus
[1:07:48] and when you apply the blood of Jesus
[1:07:52] you will be protected
[1:07:54] from all the plans of Satan from all the
[1:07:59] schemes
[1:08:01] even from people who are thinking evil
[1:08:04] things against us
[1:08:07] but they know they cannot do anything
[1:08:09] again
[1:08:11] speaking against you
[1:09:04] so they applied the blood on their
[1:09:06] doorsteps
[1:09:09] but then
[1:09:12] that was chemistry
[1:09:15] now we see that in the first exercise
[1:09:20] the animal was the one the sacrifice
[1:09:22] woman which was meant to be perfect
[1:09:26] and we see that our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:30] fulfilled all these shadows
[1:09:34] and when our Lord was going to be
[1:09:36] crucified
[1:09:38] he had to be found without any blame
[1:09:44] praise the name of Allah they brought
[1:09:47] him to the courts of the high priest
[1:09:52] in the cons of the sanhedrine
[1:09:57] and then now they started bringing all
[1:10:00] false accusations
[1:10:05] and then they took him to Pilots
[1:10:08] when they took him to pilots
[1:10:12] and then they took him to Herod when
[1:10:16] they took him to Heroes
[1:10:20] talking back to Pirates and then the
[1:10:23] wife of pirate told him do nothing to
[1:10:26] that righteousness and then pirate
[1:10:28] started washing his heart why Christ Our
[1:10:33] sacrifice was proved perfect
[1:10:40] we are not served by the blood of the
[1:10:44] son of Mary
[1:10:46] is the name of Allah we are not served
[1:10:49] by the blood of a Jew
[1:10:52] we are not served by the blood of a man
[1:10:56] but the Bible tells us in Acts chapter
[1:11:00] 20
[1:11:01] and then verse 28
[1:11:04] praise the name of our Lord Acts chapter
[1:11:07] 20 and verse 28.
[1:11:11] take it therefore unto yourselves and
[1:11:14] and to all the flock over which the Holy
[1:11:17] Ghost has made you overseers to feeding
[1:11:20] the Church of God which he has purchased
[1:11:23] with his own blood
[1:11:27] um
[1:11:32] foreign
[1:13:09] the prostitute
[1:13:13] she was given a token a Scarlet you know
[1:13:18] a cloth which was red and then she put
[1:13:21] it on her window yeah
[1:13:27] for her protection and even now we need
[1:13:31] the token
[1:13:32] they're talking that he gives us at this
[1:13:35] time
[1:13:36] and the token that is giving us in this
[1:13:39] Third Exodus
[1:13:40] is the life of Jesus Christ
[1:13:44] no longer I that leave us but it's the
[1:13:47] Lord
[1:13:49] now if it is the Lord living in you he
[1:13:53] will protect you from all evil he will
[1:13:56] protect you from all sins he'll protect
[1:13:58] you from all destruction
[1:14:01] it's no longer you that's living but
[1:14:04] it's the life of God himself and when we
[1:14:07] come to church we need to desire the
[1:14:10] life of God
[1:15:03] you hated that person for 10 years
[1:15:07] until when they speak about that person
[1:15:09] you just hate to hear about his name
[1:15:20] remove that Spirit of hatred
[1:15:24] that Spirit of hatred is destructive
[1:15:28] praise the name of our Lord we need to
[1:15:31] get away from that
[1:15:33] praise the name of our Lord now in the
[1:15:35] message the Third Exodus
[1:15:38] he says
[1:15:41] I'm going to read in different
[1:15:42] paragraphs
[1:15:44] now in paragraph 297
[1:15:50] 297.
[1:15:52] he says we are in an exodus
[1:15:57] and living and actually then he says
[1:16:00] yakova
[1:16:02] oh my friends
[1:16:04] my brothers
[1:16:06] both present and that will hear the tips
[1:16:11] let me as your brother
[1:16:15] and citizen of the kingdom of God
[1:16:19] then he says come out
[1:16:23] in this Exodus
[1:16:26] for that's that's for all that will be
[1:16:31] left behind
[1:16:33] will bear The Mark of the Beast
[1:16:38] come out of Babylon move them Babylonia
[1:16:41] come out of this confusion
[1:16:44] come out of this system
[1:16:47] and serve the Living God
[1:16:49] no so he's telling us about the Third
[1:16:53] Exodus
[1:16:54] is coming out of Babylon
[1:16:58] coming out of confusion coming out of
[1:17:02] religion
[1:17:03] now in paragraph 299 baby
[1:17:09] paragraph 299
[1:17:11] he says the first Exodus what did he do
[1:17:16] yeah
[1:17:18] he brought them out of a natural land
[1:17:22] to a natural land that's what we have
[1:17:25] been seeing he brought them out of Egypt
[1:17:28] and then he took them the land of the
[1:17:30] promise
[1:17:36] he brought them out of a spiritual
[1:17:39] condition
[1:17:41] into a spiritual
[1:17:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:49] you know when Jesus came
[1:17:52] praise the name of our Lord they had
[1:17:54] religions they already settled in their
[1:17:57] land but they were under bondage
[1:18:01] in the land of promise
[1:18:04] can you imagine
[1:18:08] foreign
[1:18:24] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:26] now he is bringing them from the
[1:18:29] spiritual baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:33] right into the Eternal land of the
[1:18:36] Millennium
[1:18:38] and the great Hereafter
[1:18:42] the same Peter of Fire
[1:18:45] by the same anointed
[1:18:49] the same God doing the same thing
[1:18:52] and the same word
[1:18:57] that declared the first one
[1:19:00] has declared the second one the same
[1:19:04] nothing
[1:19:07] has declared the third one and we see
[1:19:11] here it Among Us
[1:19:14] come out of this chaos come to the
[1:19:19] Living God come to the world and the
[1:19:22] Word was made flesh and breasts
[1:19:35] the holy spirit in the form of a pillow
[1:19:38] fire
[1:19:41] god coming down in manifestation
[1:19:46] brought out the first Exodus
[1:19:50] and back in
[1:19:52] brought Israel out of Egypt
[1:19:57] that was the first Exodus the second
[1:20:00] Exodus was Christ
[1:20:03] bringing the church out of Judaism
[1:20:09] and then the Third Exodus is
[1:20:12] when the same Pillar of Fire
[1:20:17] takes the bride from the church
[1:20:25] out of the spiritual and the spiritual
[1:20:29] out of the spirit
[1:20:32] the spiritual out of the church rather
[1:21:02] which is led by our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:05] the Bible tells us in Matthew chapter 1
[1:21:09] and then in verse 21.
[1:21:14] Matthew chapter 1 verse 21 to verse 25.
[1:21:19] he says
[1:21:21] and she shall bring forth a son and
[1:21:25] shall call his name Jesus for He Shall
[1:21:27] Serve his people from their sins
[1:21:40] now all this was done that it might be
[1:21:43] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[1:21:46] by the prophet saying
[1:21:48] foreign
[1:21:59] shall be with child and shall bring
[1:22:02] forth a son and they shall call his name
[1:22:05] Emmanuel which is being interpreted God
[1:22:08] With Us
[1:22:23] then Joseph being raised from this sleep
[1:22:26] did as the angel of the Lord had Biden
[1:22:29] him and took unto him his wife
[1:22:41] and you are not till she had brought
[1:22:44] forth her firstborn son and called his
[1:22:47] name Jesus so the yamamanya
[1:22:51] okutzala omana
[1:22:54] yes praise the name of Allah so now we
[1:22:58] see her that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:01] is born to save us
[1:23:04] sins
[1:23:06] and the Bible says his name Shall be
[1:23:10] Called Emmanuel
[1:23:13] God With Us
[1:23:16] Praise the name of Allah when we go to
[1:23:19] Luke Chapter 2
[1:23:21] and then verse 10.
[1:23:25] Luke chapter 10 verse 10.
[1:23:29] and the angel said unto them fear not
[1:23:33] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[1:23:36] great joy we shall be to all people for
[1:23:39] unto is Born This Day in the city of
[1:23:42] David as Savior which is Christ the lord
[1:23:54] foreign
[1:25:19] so now the Bible says in John chapter 7.
[1:25:25] and then verse 37
[1:25:28] in the last day that great day of the
[1:25:31] feast Jesus stood and cried saying if
[1:25:34] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[1:25:37] drink
[1:25:39] yes
[1:25:53] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:25:57] has said out of his bury shall flow
[1:26:00] rivers of Living Water
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:12] but this spoke he of the spirit which
[1:26:15] they that believe on him should receive
[1:26:18] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[1:26:21] because that Jesus was not yet glorified
[1:26:26] foreign
[1:27:03] the Holy Spirit was not given because
[1:27:06] Jesus had not yet died and resurrected
[1:27:11] but when the Lord died and resurrected
[1:27:14] then the life that was in Jesus
[1:27:18] comes back on the day of Pentecost and
[1:27:22] when that life comes on the day of
[1:27:24] Pentecost
[1:27:26] the saints were baptized
[1:27:29] they received the baptism of the holy
[1:27:31] spirit so the baptism of the
[1:27:42] now let us go to
[1:27:45] Luke chapter 3
[1:27:47] oxide and then we read in verse 15.
[1:27:51] up to verse 16.
[1:27:55] and as the people are in expectation and
[1:27:59] all men mused in their hearts of John
[1:28:02] whether he were the Christ or not John
[1:28:06] answered saying unto them I indeed
[1:28:10] baptize you with water but one mightier
[1:28:14] than I cometh
[1:28:16] I am not worthy to unloose he shall
[1:28:20] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:28:23] fire
[1:28:29] is
[1:28:34] a
[1:28:47] foreign
[1:28:50] [Music]
[1:29:38] and then verse 4.
[1:29:42] praise the name of our Lord he says and
[1:29:46] being assembled together with them
[1:29:48] commanded them that they should not
[1:29:50] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[1:29:53] promise of the Father which says he
[1:29:56] you've heard of me
[1:30:00] foreign
[1:30:35] but you shall receive power after the
[1:30:38] Holy Ghost is come upon you and you
[1:30:41] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[1:30:43] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[1:30:46] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[1:30:49] the earth
[1:31:05] praise the name of Allah so the baptism
[1:31:08] of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:11] broken of the second Exodus
[1:31:15] it is an evidence
[1:31:18] that God has received your face
[1:31:22] you have come out of sin into his
[1:31:26] righteousness so he gives you his own
[1:31:29] Spirit
[1:31:33] to prove that he has accepted you yeah
[1:31:36] quick it is it's no longer you that
[1:31:38] lives but it is Christ that lives
[1:31:45] so now the token of the second Exodus
[1:31:49] was the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:53] praise the name of Allah and every
[1:31:57] person that receives Jesus Christ as his
[1:32:01] personal savior needs to be baptized
[1:32:04] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:07] you need to allow that life
[1:32:10] that was in the
[1:32:12] and that life in the blood of Jesus is
[1:32:16] the spirit of God the holy spirit is the
[1:32:21] spirit of Christ
[1:32:22] the holy spirit is the spirit of God so
[1:32:27] you need to allow the life that was in
[1:32:30] the
[1:32:31] in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:32:38] when you hear the word of God
[1:32:42] that word of God that you hear at the
[1:32:45] beginning
[1:32:48] and you believe that word
[1:32:51] then you are Justified
[1:32:54] and it is the word justifying yes
[1:32:59] the spirit of God justifying
[1:33:03] the blood of Christ justifying you
[1:33:07] the same thing
[1:33:35] Hebrews chapter 12. foreign
[1:33:47] 24.99
[1:33:51] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[1:33:54] Covenant and to the
[1:33:57] blue calling that speakers better things
[1:34:00] than that of Abel yes
[1:34:12] so the Bible says the blood of Jesus
[1:34:18] speaks better
[1:34:24] now in the message
[1:34:28] praise the name of our Lord he says now
[1:34:32] we find also in the Hebrews
[1:34:35] Hebrews
[1:34:39] and verse 24. that the New Testament
[1:34:44] the blood speaks better things
[1:34:48] the blood is speaking
[1:34:52] then the blood has got a voice
[1:34:56] and the voice of the blood is
[1:35:34] came the spirit of Christ so then it is
[1:35:39] the spirit of Christ
[1:35:41] that is bringing conviction to take you
[1:35:45] from this Evil Soul to take you from
[1:35:47] this evil action to take you from this
[1:35:50] weakness this is the same thing so then
[1:35:54] the Holy Spirit
[1:35:55] starts working Upon Our Lives
[1:35:59] when we believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:04] so the spirit of God is not far from you
[1:36:09] he has already started walking upon your
[1:36:12] life
[1:36:13] the moment you are you raised your heart
[1:36:16] oh Lord I accept you as my personal
[1:36:19] assistant the spirit of God started
[1:36:22] working upon you yeah praise the name of
[1:36:25] our Lord so then he says
[1:36:51] and if the Bloods you know if the blood
[1:36:55] or Messiah speaks better things
[1:36:59] then the voice of the blood is
[1:37:03] the word and then he says the voice of
[1:37:08] the blood is the holy spirit now what is
[1:37:13] the difference it is the same thing
[1:37:16] but you need to grow up in it
[1:37:22] obedience
[1:37:23] total obedience to the world
[1:37:28] surrender to the blood
[1:37:31] and then the Holy Spirit take over all
[1:37:34] your life
[1:37:35] it's not difficult to apply the token
[1:37:39] if you have accepted the Lord Jesus as
[1:37:41] your personal savior
[1:37:43] you just need to continue
[1:37:46] Lord I surrender all myself Lord I yield
[1:37:50] all myself and you know the more you
[1:37:53] surrender
[1:37:54] it's the more you are changed
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:55] if you do it foreign
[1:39:57] gumbo and so as you hear otherwise as
[1:40:00] you read the words you open the word
[1:40:02] then the holy spirit will give you the
[1:40:06] ability
[1:40:08] to fulfill that word and the time will
[1:40:12] reach that you do things
[1:40:16] unconsciously
[1:40:19] praise the name of our Lord you do
[1:40:21] things unconscious
[1:40:23] because it is part of you
[1:40:26] praise the name of Allah you and the
[1:40:29] word has become one
[1:40:32] so then you become the manifestation
[1:40:35] of the word that you believe
[1:40:38] praise the name of our Lord so then in
[1:40:41] paragraph
[1:40:42] 168
[1:40:46] show where the blood speaks
[1:40:49] it speaks better things
[1:40:52] in the Old Testament the blood spoke of
[1:40:56] guilt of foreign
[1:42:16] he has given unto us the Bible says
[1:42:21] things every interview now
[1:42:25] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:42:28] he has given us all things how
[1:42:33] through the Life of Christ
[1:42:36] and the life of Christ is the life of
[1:42:39] God
[1:42:41] praise the name of our Lord Zoe Zoe
[1:42:45] God's own life
[1:42:48] it's by the being of God
[1:42:52] the being of God
[1:42:54] created everything that we see
[1:42:58] the being of God
[1:43:01] created us
[1:43:03] Zoe Zoe created us we were formed by God
[1:43:08] we were created by God so anything that
[1:43:12] we have need of God
[1:43:14] is right before us when we receive
[1:43:18] Christ we receive whatever we have
[1:43:21] needed and then you say Lord this is
[1:43:24] Lord this is my desire Lord
[1:43:29] guide me
[1:43:33] out when you accept the Lord Jesus as
[1:43:36] your personal savior
[1:43:37] don't stop at that
[1:43:40] put a personal relationship with him
[1:43:44] and that relationship you have with
[1:43:46] Christ
[1:43:48] will bring down his life
[1:43:51] to be manifested in your life and that
[1:43:54] should be your desire if today I have
[1:43:57] failed in this area let me seek the
[1:44:00] following days
[1:44:07] don't walk away
[1:44:10] but just stay there yes
[1:44:18] hold me change me if you have evil
[1:44:22] thoughts the Lord have mercy upon us
[1:44:25] deliver me from this evil song If you do
[1:44:28] something that's not right it's the Lord
[1:44:33] forgiveness
[1:44:35] repent about it Lord deliver me from
[1:44:38] this condition
[1:44:39] praise the name of our Lord against the
[1:44:42] Lord keeps on changing
[1:44:44] walking upon you bring you into His
[1:44:47] Image
[1:44:50] that's how the blood works that's how
[1:44:53] the life of Jesus works
[1:44:55] every day keeps on Washington
[1:44:59] every day keeps on giving us Victory
[1:45:04] and so you don't say hey
[1:45:07] ah no I can't continue
[1:45:10] the blood is still there on the earth
[1:45:14] praise the name of Allah the blood of
[1:45:17] Jesus Christ
[1:45:19] is still on the altar
[1:45:22] to receive your prayer
[1:45:25] receive your petition
[1:45:27] to receive your desires
[1:45:30] this is my weakness
[1:45:54] Lord this is my weakness
[1:46:09] now in the message
[1:46:14] praise the name of our Lord
[1:46:17] message talking of 1964 February he says
[1:46:20] and tonight
[1:46:25] God requires the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:29] Ghost Aga
[1:46:37] that we have been identified in the
[1:46:40] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:46:45] there is nothing short of it
[1:46:48] the Bible teaches it rain
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:47:50] and you know brother
[1:47:57] used to be
[1:47:58] and that heisup is a common weight it is
[1:48:10] stood for Faith
[1:48:13] so faith is common
[1:48:29] don't think this thing is complicated
[1:48:38] yes do you think it's easy then you
[1:48:39] don't know where to find it
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:56] you don't know what you're looking for
[1:49:21] the Holy Ghost was given on the day of
[1:49:24] Pentecost
[1:49:26] was given a day of Pentecost he has
[1:49:30] never gone back
[1:49:32] are you getting it he has never gone
[1:49:34] back
[1:49:35] after the only because it's too close
[1:49:41] the word when is preached it's the Holy
[1:49:46] Ghost speaking so how far is the Holy
[1:49:48] Ghost
[1:49:49] just received crazy
[1:49:59] oh man united
[1:50:00] yeah
[1:50:09] the problem we have
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:33] the question is
[1:50:36] the Life of Christ
[1:50:39] you know people are looking for emotions
[1:50:47] the Holy Ghost Came Upon me I failed
[1:50:49] today
[1:50:51] there was a place I went to anyone
[1:50:55] telling me the other brother received
[1:50:57] the Holy Ghost
[1:50:59] the whole time was saying Jesus Jesus
[1:51:02] even going to the tax even going home we
[1:51:05] are trying
[1:51:08] that's not what it is
[1:51:11] the life of Jesus Christ
[1:51:16] it's the life of Jesus Christ don't look
[1:51:19] for signs of emotions
[1:51:23] but look for the life of Jesus Christ
[1:51:27] now in the message the lamp and the dove
[1:51:32] um
[1:51:33] foreign
[1:51:53] I rejoice in the spirit
[1:51:56] that has nothing to do with it
[1:51:59] it's not you rejoicing in the spirit
[1:52:03] is it the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:07] that spot on the congregation
[1:52:11] it is a new bus
[1:52:15] a change of the heart
[1:52:19] that changes in mind
[1:52:22] from a dying being
[1:52:25] to a resurrected
[1:52:28] Immortal Son of God
[1:52:31] taking his place on the seat of the
[1:52:34] believer's heart
[1:52:37] it is a nature change
[1:52:44] your nature you love sin foreign
[1:52:55] is is not true that the Bible said
[1:52:59] the rain falls on the Justice
[1:53:04] The Sun Shines on the just and the
[1:53:06] unjust
[1:53:09] you take a wheat field
[1:53:14] and the little heads are turning over
[1:53:22] here
[1:53:26] it's a drought
[1:53:31] they all distinct weeds
[1:53:38] of divine divine
[1:53:42] foreign
[1:53:54] it's a vision I saw us
[1:53:57] and they were all needing rain
[1:54:01] and when the showers came
[1:54:04] the little it rinsed up its head and
[1:54:07] rejoiced
[1:54:09] and the stick with raised up it said and
[1:54:12] rejoice
[1:54:14] and the creeper raised it said and
[1:54:16] rejoice
[1:54:21] they were just as proud to get the rain
[1:54:24] as the rest of them
[1:54:28] but brother
[1:54:30] one of them
[1:54:32] was bearing the fruit of the wheat
[1:54:37] and the other was bearing the fruit of
[1:55:13] all that goes with it but unless the
[1:55:16] fruit of the spirit
[1:55:23] with the God's word
[1:55:25] you are just good and outward
[1:55:28] demonstration
[1:55:30] and we today are relying so much on
[1:55:34] outward emotions and demonstrations
[1:55:39] thank you
[1:55:42] when it comes a genuine pure Born Again
[1:55:45] holy ghosts
[1:55:49] LED life to prove what you are
[1:55:53] now that is right my dear brother and
[1:55:56] sister
[1:55:58] unless there is fruit
[1:56:01] and the fruit of the spirit is not an
[1:56:05] outward demonstration
[1:56:08] it is an inward work of Grace Joy
[1:56:51] the life that you live
[1:56:54] is it the life of Jesus Christ
[1:56:57] now let us go to the Third Exodus
[1:57:00] as I try to see how we can wind up now
[1:57:04] in Revelations chapter 18.
[1:57:10] Revelation chapter 18 and then verse 1
[1:57:12] to verse 5.
[1:57:18] and after these things I saw another
[1:57:21] Angel come down from heaven having great
[1:57:24] power and the Earth was lightened with
[1:57:27] his glory following Nancy
[1:57:38] and he cried mightily with a strong
[1:57:41] voice saying Babylon the great is
[1:57:44] falling is falling and it's become the
[1:57:47] habitation of devils and the whole of
[1:57:49] ever false Spirit and the cage of every
[1:57:51] unclean and hateful bird for all nations
[1:57:54] have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
[1:57:57] our fornication and the kings of the
[1:57:59] Earth have committed fornication with
[1:58:01] her and the merchants of the Earth are
[1:58:04] worked Rich through the abundancy of her
[1:58:07] Delicacies
[1:58:16] foreign
[1:58:20] foreign
[1:58:53] foreign
[1:59:23] foreign
[1:59:29] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[1:59:32] and God has remembered her iniquities
[1:59:39] praise the name of our Lord so the Third
[1:59:42] Exodus which we are in
[1:59:46] calls out of Babylon
[1:59:49] and now it is a mystery Babylon
[1:59:53] means confusion
[1:59:56] and now this Babylon is a religious
[2:00:00] system
[2:00:01] the union of religions it's a call to
[2:00:05] come out of your denomination
[2:00:07] it's a call to come out of your religion
[2:00:12] in the time we are living in we are
[2:00:15] living in the Rhodesian Church age
[2:00:26] an age where they have rejected Christ
[2:00:29] knock
[2:01:04] [Music]
[2:01:13] that Christ is outside of the church
[2:01:16] you know when when you are when you are
[2:01:19] knocking on the door
[2:01:20] where do you stand you stand outside so
[2:01:25] Christ is already outside and now he's
[2:01:27] calling in the videos
[2:01:32] praise the name of our Lord come and I
[2:01:34] dine with you so it is the Third Exodus
[2:01:38] he's calling people out of denomination
[2:01:42] come out of that confusion come out of
[2:01:46] the Union of churches come out of the
[2:01:48] Union of religious systems come out of
[2:01:51] the Union of councils of churches
[2:01:57] and we see the time we're leaving it you
[2:02:00] see where all denominations all
[2:02:03] religious systems are coming together
[2:02:05] the nomination is coming
[2:02:08] on worship says
[2:02:15] worships an image of something else and
[2:02:19] then they're all coming together and
[2:02:21] then the other one worships with the
[2:02:22] judges
[2:02:25] you know witchcraft is coming on the
[2:02:29] same table then this one says
[2:02:32] and they are all being identified
[2:02:34] together
[2:02:36] and you see the scripture sayings
[2:02:39] that he will send his angels and then
[2:02:43] they will get the tears together
[2:02:45] so the religion organization
[2:02:49] the union of religions
[2:02:53] that are being bound together
[2:02:59] praise the name of Allah but now he's
[2:03:02] calling the
[2:03:04] electronics come out of her my people
[2:03:07] and don't partake of her sins for our
[2:03:11] sins have reached
[2:03:13] and the Judgment has already been
[2:03:15] pronounced
[2:03:17] so even in this sad Exodus Christ
[2:03:21] himself comes down as the pillar of fire
[2:03:24] to lead us praise the name of our Lord
[2:03:28] Christ comes down as a pill of fire and
[2:03:32] then he leads us
[2:03:34] in our generation was faster identified
[2:03:38] with with brother Branham
[2:03:41] and then God took brother Branham off
[2:03:43] the scene
[2:03:44] and when brother Branham was preaching
[2:03:47] and
[2:04:38] [Applause]
[2:04:45] the messages of the Lord
[2:05:00] we still have the same voice of God we
[2:05:04] still have the same Holy Spirit that's
[2:05:07] leading in this Exodus this Exodus is
[2:05:11] not being led by a man it is
[2:05:15] that come down praise the name of our
[2:05:18] Lord Praise himself come down now when
[2:05:22] we got back to Matthew chapter 25 where
[2:05:24] we read at the beginning
[2:05:27] the Bible says There Were Ten virgins
[2:05:36] and when they had all Slumbers
[2:05:40] in March 25 7
[2:05:43] from verse six
[2:05:46] verses
[2:05:48] and at the midnight
[2:05:51] there was a cry made behold the
[2:05:55] bridegroom cometh going out to meet him
[2:06:05] and we have heard this cry
[2:06:08] okay
[2:06:10] by the message of the hour all over back
[2:06:13] up
[2:06:15] the bridegroom comes
[2:06:18] now these virgins
[2:06:21] they had all left Egypt
[2:06:25] because they are virgins they are pure
[2:06:29] they are not adulterated
[2:06:32] praise the name of Allah but then these
[2:06:35] other five
[2:06:37] they had enough oil
[2:06:40] the others didn't have enough
[2:06:43] and that's where the difference is do
[2:06:47] you have enough oil
[2:06:49] to help you go through foreign
[2:07:08] foreign
[2:08:05] together
[2:08:22] and when it is expanding it needed a new
[2:08:27] bottle
[2:08:30] to expand with it okay okay so in the
[2:08:33] old bottom
[2:08:38] praise the name of Allah
[2:08:40] the bottles where they are vessels
[2:08:44] and what is the vessel now you and me we
[2:08:48] are the vessels
[2:08:51] so have oil In Your Vessel
[2:08:56] of God he wants to dwell in you he wants
[2:09:00] to abide in it
[2:09:04] and then the Bible says they went with
[2:09:08] their lamps
[2:09:10] what are lamps according to the
[2:09:12] scriptures
[2:09:14] Psalms 119 verse 105.
[2:09:21] Psalms 119
[2:09:24] and then verse 105.
[2:09:30] it says
[2:09:33] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
[2:09:37] and a light unto my path
[2:09:39] is
[2:09:46] so they went with their vessels
[2:09:58] but you need that lamp
[2:10:02] for the lamp to work
[2:10:04] it needed to get oil from the vessels
[2:10:10] so you need to receive the words
[2:10:14] you go with the word but you need the
[2:10:17] oil
[2:10:20] to make the word Living
[2:10:24] Praise the name of Allah to make the
[2:10:27] word alive
