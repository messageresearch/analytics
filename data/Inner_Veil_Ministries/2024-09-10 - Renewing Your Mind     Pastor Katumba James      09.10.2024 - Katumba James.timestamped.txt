[25:35] love you and we thank you
[25:36] Father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[25:40] this amen amen we can turn to Romans
[25:44] chapter
[25:47] 12 we're reading from verse one to verse
[25:55] two Romans 12 ver vers 1 to verse
[26:03] 2 I beseech you there for Brethren by
[26:07] the mercies of God that you present your
[26:10] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[26:14] acceptable unto God which is your
[26:17] reasonable service
[26:22] [Music]
[26:39] and be be not conformed to this world
[26:43] but be transformed by the renewing of
[26:46] your mind that you may prove what is
[26:49] that good and acceptable and perfect
[26:53] will of God
[27:16] so I want to preach on the
[27:19] subject Renewing Your
[27:24] Mind Renewing Your Mind
[27:29] praise the name of the Lord so the Bible
[27:31] is telling
[27:32] us let us not be conformed to this
[27:39] world you know to be
[27:42] ConEd in other words you are getting
[27:45] used to what the rest of the world
[27:50] does you know if somebody annoys
[27:54] you you hate them
[27:58] abuse them you know you do all kind of
[28:01] things of
[28:04] Revenge that's how the world handles
[28:07] that but then the Bible is telling us
[28:11] let us not be
[28:14] conformed to this world in other words
[28:19] there is a trend the world handles their
[28:23] things and then there is also a
[28:27] path you know there is a way that God
[28:29] also wants us to handle the
[28:34] things praise the name of our Lord you
[28:37] know like the
[28:38] world you know when you become a young
[28:41] man or a young
[28:44] woman you know when you grow up to
[28:48] become a young man or young
[28:51] woman you know the world teaches
[28:55] you just get a boyfriend
[29:00] girlfri and start living with
[29:03] them and then you find
[29:07] out and nowadays what the world
[29:11] does they are no longer saying
[29:14] boyfriendfriend
[29:17] though it is still there but now they
[29:21] are talking
[29:26] about whereby can live in the same
[29:32] house a man and a
[29:34] woman behave like a husband and a
[29:39] wife but they don't want say this is my
[29:42] wife this is my
[29:44] husband they are living said this is my
[29:49] partner in other words there is no much
[29:53] commitment they don't want to be
[29:56] wed but they want live like that now
[30:00] that's the trend of the
[30:02] world so now you don't get used to how
[30:05] the world handles their
[30:09] things you don't copy what the world
[30:13] does so there you will be conforming to
[30:16] this
[30:18] world but now the Bible is telling
[30:21] us that we need to be
[30:26] transformed and how are we
[30:30] transformed by you know renewing our
[30:36] mind in other words our
[30:40] thinking our
[30:43] understanding has to be
[30:46] changed praise the name of our Lord now
[30:48] the scripture is telling
[30:50] us we need to renew our
[30:54] mind in other words a complete change
[30:57] for better
[31:04] that actually is according to the word
[31:06] of
[31:09] God praise the name of the Lord like you
[31:12] know maybe at your place of
[31:15] work you know is that you're going to be
[31:18] faithful at that place of
[31:21] work you know when you are given an
[31:26] assignment you're going to do the best
[31:28] you can do to be
[31:35] diligent your home you make sure that
[31:38] you do your
[31:41] responsibility so he's saying that we
[31:44] have to have a renewal of our
[31:49] mind a renewing of our
[31:53] mind and now when we get a renewing of
[31:56] the Mind
[31:59] then that one puts us in a better
[32:04] position where we are
[32:07] transformed and when we are
[32:10] transformed we actually pattern the
[32:13] image of Jesus
[32:15] Christ and that should be our desire in
[32:18] everything we
[32:20] do to be like Jesus
[32:23] Christ praise the name of our Lord so we
[32:26] need to desire to be
[32:30] transformed and now this
[32:33] transformation comes by the change of
[32:36] our
[32:39] mind comes by the renewing of our
[32:45] mind and
[32:47] mind means
[32:51] understanding you know you understand
[32:55] better praise the name of the Lord
[32:58] handing the issues you going
[33:02] through you understand
[33:05] better in other words you can make
[33:07] better
[33:10] decisions and you know change of
[33:14] mind happens with
[33:17] growth praise the name of our Lord as
[33:20] you grow there are some things you have
[33:23] to
[33:24] leave and then there are some things you
[33:26] have to take in
[33:30] as you grow praise the name of Lord like
[33:34] a small kid who are starting learning
[33:37] how to
[33:39] talk there are some they can pronounce
[33:42] and they look funny but that's a great
[33:46] achievement as a parent you're
[33:51] excited then you keep on
[33:53] repeating and keeps on trying trying
[33:57] trying
[33:58] until you find that they able to make it
[34:03] complete and when they beginning to talk
[34:06] they speak only one
[34:08] word but then with time they add on two
[34:11] three 4
[34:15] 10 initi when they want
[34:18] something can
[34:22] say then you say maybe they want
[34:24] water but
[34:29] or sometimes they don't know how to
[34:32] speak and they see carrying
[34:35] something then they just cry for that
[34:37] something you are
[34:39] carrying so there is a
[34:42] change a change of
[34:45] understanding there is a
[34:47] growth so even us when we are walking
[34:51] before
[34:53] God there has to always be a change in
[34:56] our lives
[35:00] praise the name of our Lord when you
[35:02] continue walking with
[35:04] God you don't remain the
[35:08] same you are always
[35:12] transformed you are always
[35:14] changed praise the name of the Lord that
[35:17] means you are
[35:19] growing you are coming to
[35:22] maturity and then you'll find that your
[35:25] patience over issues also changes
[35:30] initially may not be patient with
[35:35] anybody you are only caring about
[35:38] yourself but you know as you walk with
[35:41] the
[35:42] Lord find that God keeps on changing
[35:47] you praise the name of our Lord so we
[35:50] see that
[35:53] understanding the
[35:54] Mind comes by the Holy Spirit
[35:59] praise the name of our Lord let us go to
[36:02] Proverbs 17 verse
[36:13] 27 he says he that has knowledge spares
[36:18] his words and a man of understanding is
[36:21] of an excellent spirit
[36:38] so he says when you have
[36:43] understanding you have an excellent
[36:47] Spirit praise the name of our Lord now
[36:49] when we go to Isaiah chter 11
[36:56] verse the
[37:01] says and the spirit of the Lord shall
[37:04] rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and
[37:07] understanding the spirit of counsel and
[37:09] might the spirit of knowledge and of the
[37:12] fear of the
[37:25] Lord so now when when the scripture told
[37:29] us be
[37:33] transformed by the renewing of our
[37:37] mind he's talking about the Holy
[37:43] Spirit giving you an
[37:47] understanding according to the word of
[37:51] God praise the name of our Lord so now
[37:54] as God gives you understanding
[37:59] so even your
[38:01] walk should always be
[38:04] different praise the name of the Lord
[38:07] you don't make decisions like the people
[38:09] don't know
[38:11] God you don't walk like the people who
[38:14] don't know
[38:17] God you know that this is
[38:20] wrong you know this is
[38:23] right praise the name of the Lord like
[38:26] if you have got the understanding of the
[38:28] spirit of
[38:31] God and then you want a
[38:35] cloth you go to the
[38:38] shop now when you go to the
[38:41] shop you're not going to get a
[38:43] transparent cloth if you have the
[38:44] understanding of the Holy
[38:50] Spirit you're not going to get a cloth
[38:52] which exposes your body if you have the
[38:54] Holy Spirit
[39:00] you're not going to get a cloth which is
[39:01] a body
[39:04] tight because the spirit
[39:07] inside is not comfortable with that
[39:12] decision praise the name of the Lord and
[39:15] you find that if you make a mistake and
[39:17] get such a
[39:21] CLA you want to dispose it of
[39:25] immediately why because you
[39:29] understanding your mind has been
[39:34] renewed name of Lord your mind has been
[39:39] renewed it's not like the people of the
[39:44] world praise the name of Lord like on
[39:48] evening Friday
[39:50] evening people are going for party
[39:54] places show places and everything
[39:59] but now if your mind has been
[40:03] renewed you know you have the
[40:05] understanding of the Holy
[40:08] Spirit you not go
[40:12] toes you not go to such funny
[40:16] places instead your mind will desire to
[40:18] go into
[40:21] Fellowship I want to be in the presence
[40:23] of
[40:24] God I want to seek the face of of the
[40:29] Lord because your mind has been
[40:34] renewed praise the name of the Lord so
[40:37] now when the Holy Spirit is within
[40:40] us he will lead
[40:43] us praise the name of the Lord and the
[40:46] Bible says the children of
[40:49] God are led by the spirit of
[40:53] God and the spirit of God
[40:57] does not lead you to evil
[41:01] places but the spirit of
[41:04] God will always lead you to correct
[41:09] places praise the name of the Lord go to
[41:12] First Corinthians
[41:17] chapter and then
[41:25] verse The Script
[41:28] says but God has revealed them unto us
[41:32] by his spirit for the spirit seares all
[41:36] things yeah the Deep things of
[41:50] God for what man knoweth the things of
[41:53] God Save The Spirit of man which is in
[41:56] him even so the things of God knows no
[42:01] man but the spirit of
[42:17] God now we have received not the spirit
[42:20] of the world but the spirit which is of
[42:23] god that we might know the things that
[42:26] are free
[42:27] given to us of
[42:39] God which things we speak not in The
[42:43] Words which man's Wisdom teaches but
[42:46] which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing
[42:48] spiritual with spiritual
[43:07] praise the name of our Lord so the Bible
[43:09] is telling us we cannot know the things
[43:12] of
[43:14] God unless it is the spirit of
[43:18] God that comes and reveals them to
[43:21] us so then if our minds are going to be
[43:25] renewed
[43:28] we need the Holy
[43:30] Spirit to reveal to us the things of
[43:34] God and now when the things of God are
[43:37] revealed to
[43:39] you and then you are subject to that
[43:44] Revelation then you are
[43:48] transformed praise the name of our Lord
[43:51] you become
[43:53] transformed by the revelation of the
[43:56] word of God
[43:59] it empowers
[44:01] you praise the name of our Lord the
[44:04] Bible says we shall know the
[44:07] truth and the truth shall make us
[44:11] free so the Holy Spirit reveals unto you
[44:15] the
[44:17] truth and then that truth you have
[44:20] known when you rejoice in that
[44:24] truth you become delivered
[44:28] praise the name of our Lord you become
[44:30] delivered of your
[44:33] bondages you become delivered of your
[44:38] weaknesses because you have
[44:40] known the mind of God and the Holy
[44:45] Spirit reveals to us the mind of
[44:49] God the holy spirit gives us the
[44:53] understanding of
[44:55] God praise the name of our Lord
[44:57] we can look at an example of
[45:02] Simon Simeon was an old
[45:06] man and then he was waiting for the
[45:08] consolation of
[45:11] Israel and the Bible says that the Holy
[45:15] Spirit was upon
[45:17] him and now what the Holy Ghost
[45:21] did what the Holy Spirit
[45:24] did the Holy Spirit
[45:27] revealed to
[45:29] Simeon that you are not going to
[45:33] die until you see the Lord is
[45:36] Christ praise the name of our Lord so it
[45:40] didn't
[45:42] matter Simeon was
[45:46] bedridden if sickness would come and hit
[45:49] Simeon
[45:52] down he knew I'm not going to die
[45:57] the Holy Ghost has revealed to me that
[46:00] I'm not going to die until I see the
[46:03] Lord is
[46:04] Christ and we also need to get the same
[46:09] condition praise the name of the Lord
[46:11] that I'm not going to
[46:13] fail I'm not going to fail in this
[46:16] area I'm not going to die here I'm not
[46:20] going to be defeated in this
[46:22] condition why because the Holy Spirit
[46:26] has given you an
[46:29] understanding of the will of the
[46:32] Lord praise the name of our Lord that
[46:35] should be the same thing with
[46:37] us as a young man as a young
[46:41] woman you can make a decision in your
[46:44] life I am not going to be defined like
[46:47] the rest of the young
[46:50] people the of Our Lord like you know
[46:54] people say there are no virgin God
[46:59] but you can say I can stand on the
[47:01] Promises of
[47:02] God I'm not going to be
[47:06] defiled nobody is going to touch
[47:10] me I'm not going to touch
[47:13] anybody until I'm married you can make
[47:17] that
[47:18] decision because you have got the
[47:21] understanding of
[47:22] God and that understanding of God
[47:27] empowers you to fulfill the promise of
[47:31] God praise the name of our Lord Daniel
[47:36] they knew the word of God when they took
[47:39] them to
[47:41] captivity the Bible says they purposed
[47:45] in their
[47:46] heart not to defile
[47:50] themselves what was it they had the
[47:54] understanding of God
[47:57] said Lord your word tells
[48:00] us not to eat the food offer to
[48:06] Idols not to offer not to eat things
[48:09] that are
[48:11] defiled so they puros in their heart we
[48:16] are not going to defile
[48:18] ourselves praise the name of the Lord
[48:21] even you at your place of work you can
[48:24] decide
[48:26] to behave like the rest of these
[48:29] people at your school you can make a
[48:34] purpose praise the name of Lord like now
[48:38] there's a
[48:39] scenario praise the name of our Lord you
[48:42] know there's a univ I was told
[48:46] of you know children go there to
[48:50] study when people go there to
[48:55] study they go they get they call
[48:59] them
[49:09] en and you
[49:11] know man or a
[49:16] woman if a man gets a girl lives with
[49:20] him like a wife that that is M en
[49:29] and it's aure
[49:31] there but you see if you have had an
[49:35] understanding of
[49:37] God you're not going to be defiled with
[49:40] that kind of
[49:42] thing you purpose
[49:45] yourself I'm not going to be defiled by
[49:48] the cultes of this
[49:51] place I'm not going to be derailed by
[49:53] the behaviors of the society that I live
[49:55] in
[49:59] praise the name of our Lord you
[50:02] purpose you make a
[50:04] decision praise the name of the Lord
[50:07] Brother
[50:09] says you know when Paul when he was in
[50:13] the book of
[50:15] Acts they were actually in the
[50:19] ship and then they took about 3 days it
[50:21] was all the time
[50:26] were
[50:29] coming and then Paul was telling these
[50:33] people you people don't do this and
[50:37] this but the boss has refused to hear
[50:41] Paul and then now the angel of the Lord
[50:44] came and revealed to
[50:47] Paul and told him you all going to be
[50:50] safe until you
[50:55] land but now when these people were
[50:58] actually the storms were coming and D
[51:00] was becoming
[51:04] bad they wanted to kill the
[51:07] people because they were
[51:09] prisoners they didn't want anybody of
[51:11] them to
[51:12] escape so and these were not eating food
[51:16] because they were
[51:19] afraid told them you can now eat
[51:22] food we are all safe God has told me
[51:25] that we all going to be
[51:29] and then they became up and started
[51:30] eating
[51:32] food so now when they reached an
[51:37] island before they reached that
[51:41] Island you know the angel revealed to
[51:45] Paul that you are all going to be
[51:48] safe and you're going to stand before
[51:53] Cesar so now when Paul reached the
[51:56] island
[51:59] and then the place was too
[52:02] cold so he got fire
[52:06] firewood and then he started putting
[52:09] lighting
[52:11] fire and then a terrible snake came and
[52:14] beat
[52:17] him and then the men of the island
[52:23] said say this man has survived the the
[52:29] storms but the sins he has are not
[52:32] allowing him to live until he's going to
[52:34] die
[52:38] now and they looked at to die because
[52:41] they said this man must be
[52:44] terrible but the Bible says Just sh off
[52:48] the serpent the Viper
[52:52] like and then now when they Wonder Paul
[52:54] was not dying
[52:56] this one must be a
[53:00] God praise the name of our so brother
[53:03] Bram
[53:05] says had
[53:08] fa that nothing would kill
[53:12] him because God told
[53:15] him you are going to stand before
[53:19] Cesar so no storm would deter
[53:23] that no python would come and kill
[53:29] he had an understanding of the
[53:32] Holy and brother
[53:35] says whenever he sees a
[53:40] vision that was a perfect Faith
[53:46] issue he got perfect
[53:51] faith that nothing can stop what God has
[53:54] shown me that
[53:58] praise the name of the Lord so now even
[54:01] us we can have an
[54:06] assurance we can have an
[54:09] assurance that whatever promise God has
[54:13] given to
[54:15] us he is going to make it come to
[54:19] pass praise the name of the Lord you
[54:21] need to get that
[54:24] Revelation you need to have your mind
[54:30] changed praise the name of the Lord let
[54:32] your mind be
[54:36] renewed when God revealed to
[54:40] Simon you're not going to
[54:43] die what was Simeon waiting
[54:46] for every day Lord I want to see the
[54:51] Christ see the Christ want see the
[54:54] Christ
[54:57] that should also be our promise
[54:59] now the change of our
[55:02] bodies every day saying
[55:05] Lord I'm ready for the
[55:08] Rapture I want a bondage
[55:11] change praise the name of our Lord
[55:14] because that's the climax we are
[55:17] reaching that's the
[55:20] climax that's our
[55:23] adoption you know like a student
[55:26] when a student start
[55:29] school they are looking at the topmost
[55:34] class if a child starts piece
[55:37] one they start looking at pie
[55:42] seven the final
[55:44] exams if a child starts senior
[55:47] one they start looking at senior
[55:51] 4 if he's in senior five they start
[55:55] looking at senior

[56:00] year looking at their
[56:07] graduation even us now we are looking
[56:11] forward to the
[56:14] rupture praise the name of our Lord but
[56:17] now as we keep on looking forward to the
[56:22] rapture we need to have our mind renewed
[56:28] we need to have our mind renewed
[56:33] continuously praise the name of the let
[56:36] us go to Titus Chapter

[56:56] he saved us by the washing of
[57:00] regeneration and by the renewing of the
[57:03] Holy
[57:06] Ghost Titus 3 ver 5
[57:16] [Music]
[57:30] which is shed on us
[57:33] abundantly through Jesus Christ Our
[57:45] Savior now you look at this very
[57:47] interesting
[57:50] scriptures let us go back to verse
[57:53] five he says not by works of our
[58:00] righteousness salvation is of the
[58:04] Lord praise the name of the Lord not by
[58:07] works of
[58:11] righteousness we have
[58:14] done but according to his
[58:19] Mercy he saved
[58:22] us let us look there both of us pray the
[58:26] name of the Lord but according to his
[58:31] Mercy he saved
[58:34] us by the washing of
[58:45] regeneration and by the renewing of the
[58:48] Holy Spirit
[58:57] verse
[58:58] six now he says which he shed on us
[59:07] abundant through Jesus Christ Our
[59:12] Savior now he said which he shed on
[59:20] us what did he shed on
[59:23] us the Holy Spirit
[59:28] and that word
[59:31] sh actuallya brings it out clearly but
[59:36] shed is to

[59:43] holy
[59:45] spirit
[59:48] abundantly praise the name of our Lord
[59:51] he saved us he regenerated us
[59:57] and then he poured his holy
[1:00:04] spirit
[1:00:07] abundantly salvation is of the
[1:00:10] Lord praise the name of our Lord you
[1:00:13] know you can't read these
[1:00:15] scriptures and then you said the Holy
[1:00:17] Ghost is
[1:00:21] hiding now it is hide and seek
[1:00:32] praise the name of Lord says he shed
[1:00:38] abundantly praise the name of the Lord
[1:00:40] he saved
[1:00:42] you and the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:48] Spirit the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:57] is only pegged on one
[1:01:10] condition and be baptized in the name of
[1:01:13] Jesus
[1:01:14] Christ and you shall receive the Holy
[1:01:17] Spirit that's where it
[1:01:19] is so the thing of it you take that
[1:01:24] promise of God
[1:01:27] you are obedient to that promise of
[1:01:29] God the Holy Ghost comes
[1:01:32] down praise the name of the Lord so he
[1:01:35] says he Shar on
[1:01:38] us the Holy

[1:01:47] God by his
[1:01:50] grace he pourers the Holy
[1:01:54] Spirit upon us
[1:01:57] praise the name of the Lord so you can't
[1:02:00] say I've looked for the Holy Ghost 10
[1:02:05] years then you don't know what the Holy
[1:02:07] Ghost
[1:02:09] is praise the name of our Lord because
[1:02:12] the holy
[1:02:14] spirit is the
[1:02:17] door how did you enter
[1:02:20] in praise the name of the Lord the Holy
[1:02:23] Ghost
[1:02:26] ministers to you the
[1:02:30] entrance unless a man is born
[1:02:34] again he cannot
[1:02:37] enter that means that you are still
[1:02:50] outside it's very
[1:02:53] funny praise the name of the Lord the
[1:02:56] Holy
[1:02:57] Spirit ministers to us an
[1:03:03] entrance like on Sunday we saying it's
[1:03:06] the holy
[1:03:08] spirit that picks you from your
[1:03:13] sins and walks with
[1:03:16] you and then he removes your
[1:03:20] sin justifies you it's the Holy Spirit
[1:03:25] he keeps on walking with you and then he
[1:03:28] washes
[1:03:29] you washing you Wasing you when you are
[1:03:34] clean then he fills you
[1:03:38] himself so you become the Tabernacle of
[1:03:42] God and the Holy Ghost does not stop
[1:03:46] there but it's the holy ghost that keeps
[1:03:48] you
[1:03:50] growing he he becomes your
[1:03:53] tutor and he's the one who brings to
[1:03:56] full
[1:03:58] adoption so you're not that
[1:04:01] side you're not there and the Holy Ghost
[1:04:05] is
[1:04:07] there that means it's your own working
[1:04:10] of
[1:04:12] salvation but the Salvation is of the
[1:04:16] Lord every step that we
[1:04:20] take it's the grace of God it's by the
[1:04:24] spirit of God
[1:04:27] praise the name of our now you can start
[1:04:30] asking
[1:04:32] yourself
[1:04:36] child why haven't you
[1:04:41] back it's because the holy spirit is
[1:04:44] holding
[1:04:47] you is the one working in your
[1:04:50] life praise the name of our Lord so now
[1:04:53] we need to allow the Holy Spirit
[1:04:58] to renew our
[1:05:01] mind praise the name of and then he
[1:05:04] keeps on
[1:05:09] renewing he pours on
[1:05:12] us
[1:05:14] himself praise the name of the Lord let
[1:05:18] us go to Romans chapter 5se
[1:05:27] praise the name of the
[1:05:29] Lord Romans 5 and verse
[1:05:33] 5 another interesting
[1:05:36] scripture he says and hope makes not
[1:05:40] ashamed because the love of God is shed
[1:05:44] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:49] which is given to us
[1:06:10] amen so he says that love of
[1:06:15] God is powered in our
[1:06:19] hearts by
[1:06:21] what by your
[1:06:23] Works no by your
[1:06:28] abilities no it is powered in our
[1:06:33] hearts the love is powered in our
[1:06:37] hearts by the holy
[1:06:41] spirit that has been given to
[1:06:44] us so you can't renew your
[1:06:48] mind it is the holy
[1:06:52] spirit that renews your mind
[1:06:56] the holy spirit that renews your
[1:07:01] understanding and as the Holy Ghost
[1:07:03] renews your
[1:07:07] understanding the Holy Ghost gives you
[1:07:10] the
[1:07:12] power to fulfill the understanding of
[1:07:17] God so that love the Bible says the Holy
[1:07:22] Ghost pourers the love of God in our
[1:07:24] hearts
[1:07:27] and now when the love of God is in your
[1:07:31] heart you are able to express the love
[1:07:34] of
[1:07:38] God you become a living
[1:07:42] epist not by
[1:07:45] yourself but the holy spirit that lives
[1:07:48] in
[1:07:49] you it gives you the
[1:07:52] ability it gives you the energy
[1:07:56] to fulfill the word of
[1:07:59] God praise the name of our Lord you find
[1:08:02] that you are
[1:08:04] living you are not
[1:08:08] troubled you don't have money in on
[1:08:12] you but you're not going to behave like
[1:08:15] other people in the
[1:08:17] world when people in the world don't
[1:08:19] have
[1:08:21] money they try to make a deal of how to
[1:08:24] cheat somebody
[1:08:27] or others are not patient they go and
[1:08:30] they Canal or pick
[1:08:35] pocket all those who go to The Villages
[1:08:38] they is not coming and then they break
[1:08:39] somebody's
[1:08:45] maze but now when you have the spirit of
[1:08:48] God he will give you the
[1:08:51] ability not to do those
[1:08:54] things much as you don't
[1:08:56] have but you have enough
[1:09:00] ability to reject to do
[1:09:03] evil praise the name of the Lord that's
[1:09:06] the spirit of God working in your
[1:09:09] life not your
[1:09:11] ability praise the name of our
[1:09:14] Lord so now we need to yield to the
[1:09:17] spirit of
[1:09:20] God that the Holy Ghost may keep on
[1:09:23] transforming us
[1:09:27] to bring us into the image of Jesus
[1:09:31] Christ praise the name of our
[1:09:33] Lord let us make a comparison here
[1:09:38] now we go to Romans 1 verse
[1:09:44] 28 the Bible says and even as they did
[1:09:49] not retain God in their knowledge God
[1:09:53] gave them over to a reprobate man mind
[1:09:56] to do those things which are not
[1:10:13] convenient now the Bible says when they
[1:10:18] reject
[1:10:20] God when they reject the renewing of
[1:10:24] their mind by the the Holy
[1:10:26] [Music]
[1:10:29] Spirit then God gives them over to an
[1:10:32] evil
[1:10:37] spirit and now that terrible
[1:10:41] spirit gives them a reprobate
[1:10:46] mind you know an understanding which is
[1:10:53] terrible not fitful
[1:10:57] not
[1:11:00] approved they have an
[1:11:04] understanding which is
[1:11:07] contr to the word of
[1:11:09] God because they have refuse the Holy
[1:11:14] Spirit to renew their
[1:11:18] mind give them a better
[1:11:22] understanding you know to show them the
[1:11:24] path to
[1:11:27] take they get a terrible
[1:11:31] understanding and when they get a
[1:11:33] terrible
[1:11:36] understanding they start doing bad
[1:11:40] things they start doing wicked
[1:11:45] things when you continue reading in that
[1:11:47] book of
[1:11:50] Romans praise the name of our Lord
[1:11:52] because of a reprobate mind
[1:11:56] the Bible says they do things which are
[1:12:00] not
[1:12:04] convenient and then he Nam some of these
[1:12:06] inconvenient
[1:12:10] things
[1:12:12] 29 being filled with all and
[1:12:19] righteousness
[1:12:21] fornication
[1:12:23] wickedness cous
[1:12:28] maliciousness let us start again being
[1:12:31] filled with all
[1:12:36] unrighteousness
[1:12:38] forication
[1:12:42] wickedness
[1:12:44] maliciousness full of
[1:12:47] Envy
[1:12:49] mder
[1:12:52] debate deit
[1:13:00] mality
[1:13:03] Whisperers
[1:13:05] backbiters haters of
[1:13:08] God
[1:13:11] despiteful
[1:13:13] proud
[1:13:15] buers inventors of evil
[1:13:18] things disobedient to
[1:13:21] Parents Without understanding
[1:13:26] Covenant
[1:13:28] Breakers without natural
[1:13:36] affection
[1:13:39] merciful praise the name of our so now
[1:13:42] you
[1:13:43] see rejecting the Holy
[1:13:47] Spirit then you get a terrible
[1:13:51] mind praise the name of the Lord so then
[1:13:54] we need to allow the Holy
[1:13:59] Spirit to renew our
[1:14:03] mind how is our mind
[1:14:07] renewed by the word of
[1:14:10] God the Holy Spirit revealing to us the
[1:14:13] word of
[1:14:15] God as the Holy Ghost reveals to you the
[1:14:18] word of
[1:14:21] God and you know it's the Holy Ghost
[1:14:23] doing everything
[1:14:26] reveals to you you are
[1:14:30] obedient so he fulfills what he
[1:14:33] says and then the Bible says the Holy
[1:14:37] Spirit forers the love of God in our
[1:14:42] hearts the Holy Ghost refreshes
[1:14:47] Us Praise the name of our Lord so the
[1:14:50] Holy Ghost works out our lives
[1:14:55] as our minds are
[1:14:58] renewed as we get the understanding of
[1:15:01] the mind of
[1:15:04] God so even we are
[1:15:08] transformed to be in the image of Jesus
[1:15:12] Christ praise the name of the Lord let
[1:15:15] us also pick another
[1:15:18] example Romans 7 and verse 25
[1:15:26] the Bible
[1:15:27] says I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:15:30] Our Lord so then with the mind I myself
[1:15:33] serve the law of God but with the flesh
[1:15:36] the law of sin
[1:15:56] so now we should desire the word of
[1:16:01] God you know it is the one that renews
[1:16:06] us and now as we are getting that
[1:16:12] understanding this is what God wants me
[1:16:14] to
[1:16:15] do this is something of
[1:16:18] God it transforms
[1:16:21] you you you don't make a decision like
[1:16:24] the rest of the people
[1:16:27] praise the name of Lord don't speak like
[1:16:30] the rest of the
[1:16:32] people you don't conduct yourself like
[1:16:34] the rest of the
[1:16:36] people because you have an
[1:16:40] understanding which has been
[1:16:43] renewed praise the name of the Lord and
[1:16:46] our
[1:16:48] renewal is
[1:16:51] continuous every day as you stand before
[1:16:53] God
[1:16:55] he keeps renewing
[1:16:57] you it's a continuous
[1:17:01] flow praise the name of the Lord not
[1:17:04] just like a
[1:17:06] river it keeps on
[1:17:09] flowing and as it
[1:17:11] flows it pushes off the
[1:17:15] trash praise the name of the Lord and
[1:17:17] that's what the Holy Ghost does in our
[1:17:19] lives renewed by the Holy
[1:17:22] Spirit a continuous flow
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:27] and the Bible says don't the Holy
[1:17:31] Spirit why you need it to keep on
[1:17:35] burning praise the name of our Lord I
[1:17:38] think it was the other
[1:17:41] day on Saturday my wife went to visit
[1:17:44] where our daughter studies
[1:17:49] from and then now they were sitting in a
[1:17:53] place and then they were being told that
[1:17:55] this is where the altar
[1:17:59] is and then they had put there of
[1:18:04] stones and then they put the 12 tribes
[1:18:06] of
[1:18:08] Israel and then there is a woman who is
[1:18:11] there most of the
[1:18:14] time to see that the fire keeps
[1:18:19] burning and so they tell the people this
[1:18:21] place is sacred
[1:18:25] the students so they go there to start
[1:18:29] praying doesn't want to just sit there
[1:18:31] but should go there and pray and
[1:18:36] meditate and they make sure that the
[1:18:37] fire burs 24
[1:18:43] hours so now when my wife was telling me
[1:18:48] that so she told our
[1:18:52] daughter this is a shrine
[1:18:58] praise the name of our but now they are
[1:19:01] using the the symbols of the Old
[1:19:05] Testament to see the stones are there
[1:19:08] the fire is
[1:19:11] burning so children go there themselves
[1:19:15] pray
[1:19:17] down that have G the
[1:19:20] altar so when she was telling me
[1:19:23] that that they keep the fire
[1:19:27] burning and what came to my
[1:19:30] mind it is the holy spirit that should
[1:19:33] keep on burning in our
[1:19:36] hearts praise the name of the Lord we
[1:19:39] just need to keep the Holy
[1:19:42] Spirit burning in our
[1:19:45] hearts continuous
[1:19:48] light Continuous
[1:19:51] Flow the Holy Ghost burning
[1:19:56] maybe when you get a wrong
[1:19:58] thought the Holy Ghost Burns it you get
[1:20:02] a wrong desire the Holy Ghost Burns
[1:20:06] it you get trapped up in
[1:20:09] something the Holy Ghost Burns
[1:20:12] it praise the name of our Lord we just
[1:20:15] need that continuous fire of God in our
[1:20:20] hearts praise the name of our Lord then
[1:20:23] it renews us
[1:20:26] it gives us an understanding according
[1:20:28] to the word of
[1:20:31] God praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:20:34] you are
[1:20:36] transformed praise the name of
[1:20:39] our let us go to Titus 1 as I try to
[1:20:46] finish Titus 1 verse
[1:20:53] 15 unto the pure all things are pure but
[1:20:58] unto them that are
[1:21:00] defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure
[1:21:05] but even their mind and conscience is
[1:21:08] defiled
[1:21:36] praise the name of the Lord so in our
[1:21:39] Christian
[1:21:42] walk we need to seek a renewal by the
[1:21:45] Holy
[1:21:48] Spirit as you
[1:21:50] walk you can become weary
[1:21:55] you can
[1:21:56] faint so you need a
[1:22:00] renewal you need a
[1:22:04] refresh
[1:22:05] Moses when he had got the
[1:22:09] Commandments and then he goes to the
[1:22:11] camp and the children of Israel were
[1:22:13] worshiping an
[1:22:18] idol Moses threw those stones before
[1:22:23] them you know he was
[1:22:27] disappointed so now
[1:22:29] Moses after all the effort he had
[1:22:33] putting he became so
[1:22:37] weary because what he was doing was not
[1:22:39] being
[1:22:42] followed now he had to go back to
[1:22:47] God he sought a
[1:22:51] renewal and he said Lord I want to see
[1:22:54] your grow
[1:22:57] was seeking a
[1:22:59] r he said if I found fav before
[1:23:05] you see your
[1:23:08] glory and he found favor before
[1:23:12] God and so he was
[1:23:15] renewed and now when he came from the
[1:23:19] mountain the glory of God was upon his
[1:23:22] face
[1:23:25] until was
[1:23:27] shining prise the name of our Lord and
[1:23:30] that's why we need also to be
[1:23:34] renew you need go to renew your
[1:23:41] mind
[1:23:43] understanding and then you'll find such
[1:23:46] joy
[1:23:49] unspeakable praise the name of the Lord
[1:23:52] when David sin
[1:23:55] praise the name of the Lord and then the
[1:23:57] prophet told him you have done
[1:24:00] evil David
[1:24:03] repented and he
[1:24:05] sought a
[1:24:07] renewal and then he prayed in Psalms
[1:24:11] 51 Lord restore unto me the joy of
[1:24:17] th he was seeking a
[1:24:21] renewal a refreshment
[1:24:25] praise the name of our Lord and each and
[1:24:27] every one of us can seek the
[1:24:29] same Lord renew
[1:24:32] me restore unto
[1:24:35] me praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:24:38] you see how the Lord can come
[1:24:41] in
[1:24:43] brother when he
[1:24:46] deceived and then the spirit rebuked him
[1:24:48] that you're
[1:24:51] hypocrite he went and repented
[1:24:55] and he went in the
[1:24:58] forest and he sought a
[1:25:01] renewal and then the Lord renewed him
[1:25:04] was so
[1:25:08] happy praise the name of Lord we also
[1:25:11] need to renew our
[1:25:13] mind renewing yourself before

[1:25:20] yourself you restore your
[1:25:23] joy you restore your
[1:25:26] strength and you are able to move
[1:25:28] further than you have
[1:25:30] been praise the name of Lord when Samson
