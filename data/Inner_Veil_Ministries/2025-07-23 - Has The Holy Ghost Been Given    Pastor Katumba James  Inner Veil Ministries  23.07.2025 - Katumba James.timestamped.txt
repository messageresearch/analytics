[0:01] Love
[0:03] me
[0:11] just my
[0:14] salvation.
[0:22] Oh,
[0:24] cal
[0:27] free.
[0:31] Amen. Praise the name of our Lord.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; You're welcome to this evening service.
[0:40] Praise the name of our Lord. On Friday,
[0:43] we are going to have an overnight.
[0:47] So, you are all welcome.
[0:50] Then on Sunday we shall have only one
[0:52] service
[0:54] and let us open without prayer.
[0:58] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:00] Christ
[1:03] we thank you for this evening Lord
[1:07] the grace that you've given unto us
[1:09] father
[1:11] that we can come into your presence.
[1:15] You said where two or three are gathered
[1:17] in your name.
[1:20] You will be there in their midst.
[1:24] And we believe you are here, Father.
[1:26] And you also said in your word,
[1:29] they shall be taught of the Lord
[1:33] and great shall be their peace.
[1:36] That prayer may come and speak to us the
[1:37] words of eternal life
[1:41] that we may have that peace
[1:44] that surpasses all understanding.
[1:47] May you have prayer upon this meeting.
[1:51] May you also meet the needs of all your
[1:53] children
[1:55] that all the glory and honor may be back
[1:57] unto you
[2:00] in Jesus name we do pray and ask this.
[2:04] Amen. Amen.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; We go to the book of John chapter 7.
[2:12] We're reading from verse 37 up to verse
[2:17] 39.
[2:24] John chapter 7
[2:29] from verse 37 to verse 39.
[2:35] The Bible says
[2:37] &gt;&gt; in the last day, that great day of the
[2:39] feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,
[2:43] "If any man thirst, let him come unto me
[2:47] and drink.
[3:05] He that believeth on me, as the
[3:08] scripture has said, out of his belly
[3:11] shall flow rivers of living water.
[3:23] But this spoke he of the spirit which
[3:26] they that
[3:28] children
[3:31] was not yet given because that Jesus was
[3:34] not yet glorified.
[3:48] May God sing of his word.
[3:51] You may be seated. So I want to take a
[3:54] subject
[3:56] from verse 39.
[4:00] And it's kind of like a question.
[4:03] Has the Holy Ghost been given?
[4:08] Has the Holy Ghost been given?
[4:12] Praise the name of the Lord. So here the
[4:15] Bible is telling us
[4:17] when Jesus was telling the people
[4:21] that if any man thirst
[4:26] let him come unto me
[4:28] and drink and then the Bible says he was
[4:33] talking about the Holy Ghost.
[4:38] But at the time Jesus was saying this in
[4:40] John chapter 7,
[4:45] during the time Jesus was saying this in
[4:46] John chapter 7,
[4:50] the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[4:54] and then the Bible says because Jesus
[4:58] was not yet glorified,
[5:01] he had not yet died,
[5:04] you know, and then resurrected.
[5:07] But now we are living at the time
[5:10] where the Holy Ghost has already been
[5:15] given.
[5:16] And the Holy Ghost was already given on
[5:20] the day of Pentecost
[5:23] in Acts chapter 2.
[5:26] And then in verse one,
[5:30] &gt;&gt; the scripture says,
[5:35] "And when the day of Pentecost was fully
[5:38] come, they were all with one accord in
[5:42] one place."
[5:47] Acts 2:1.
[5:57] And suddenly there came a sound from
[5:59] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and
[6:03] it filled all the house where they were
[6:06] sitting.
[6:20] And there appeared unto them cloven
[6:24] tanks like as of fire, and it sat upon
[6:27] each of them.
[6:39] And they were all filled with the Holy
[6:41] Ghost and began to speak with other
[6:44] tongues as the spirit gave them
[6:47] utterance.
[6:55] Praise the name of our Lord. So the Holy
[6:57] Ghost was given on the day of Pentecost.
[7:03] So from the day of Pentecost,
[7:06] we are living in a time
[7:09] whereby the Holy Spirit
[7:12] has already been given to us.
[7:15] And now if the Holy Ghost has already
[7:17] been given to us,
[7:20] then we have to go and receive the Holy
[7:23] Spirit because he has already been given
[7:26] to us.
[7:27] So now the the only thing that you need
[7:30] to do
[7:32] is to make yourself
[7:35] you know in need of the Holy Spirit.
[7:39] Praise the name of the Lord you know to
[7:41] show concern
[7:43] to show interest
[7:46] that you desire the Holy Spirit
[7:49] in your life because the Holy Spirit has
[7:51] already been given.
[7:54] Now in the message Israel and the
[7:56] church,
[7:58] brother Brham says
[8:00] he says without the baptism of the Holy
[8:03] Spirit,
[8:06] you are lost,
[8:08] you won't have to worry about getting to
[8:11] heaven.
[8:15] If there is nothing in here,
[8:22] the doors can't unlock.
[8:26] You can't walk there
[8:29] and bump your head against it.
[8:33] But if the spirit of God is in there,
[8:38] the spirit of God inside
[8:42] will unhinge the doors.
[8:46] Go to have the thing in here to unlock
[8:49] it.
[8:56] So you are already just judged just on
[9:00] what you think about Jesus Christ.
[9:08] Now here comes
[9:11] torn riven
[9:14] torn
[9:17] to pieces.
[9:19] His soul went to God.
[9:24] God blessed him. And when his soul
[9:27] returned back in the form of the baptism
[9:29] of the Holy Spirit,
[9:33] that comes into every believer
[9:37] to sanctify.
[9:40] Clean up the mind,
[9:43] clean up the heart
[9:45] and leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in
[9:48] there.
[9:52] And when the Holy Ghost is given out,
[9:56] that same Holy Spirit
[9:59] that brought the body of Jesus out of
[10:03] the grave
[10:07] will rapture
[10:10] and that covenant has to do tail
[10:15] as he tore there and gave the body
[10:20] and went back to God and the spirit came
[10:24] back to the earth.
[10:28] Then your spirit will have to have the
[10:29] same kind of spirit
[10:33] or it will miss that place going
[10:36] together.
[10:40] Not because you make yourself
[10:43] but because something
[10:46] the love of God has swept into your
[10:49] soul.
[10:52] and tore every idol out.
[10:58] Praise the name of our Lord. So you see
[11:00] that when Jesus died,
[11:02] &gt;&gt; you know, he resurrected.
[11:06] So now on the day of Pentecost,
[11:09] he comes back to the church in the form
[11:12] of the Holy Spirit.
[11:16] And the Bible says the promise is unto
[11:20] you
[11:22] as many as the Lord our God shall call.
[11:27] So now if God has called us,
[11:30] then he has also released the Holy
[11:32] Spirit
[11:34] that the Holy Spirit can come down to
[11:36] us.
[11:38] We are living in a time where the Holy
[11:42] Spirit has already been given.
[11:46] Now if the Holy Spirit has already been
[11:48] given
[11:50] then you go forward and receive the Holy
[11:52] Spirit.
[11:54] Praise the name of our Lord because he
[11:56] has already been given. So the thing of
[11:58] it we need to do when we hear the gospel
[12:02] of Jesus Christ, we need to be obedient
[12:05] to the whole gospel.
[12:08] Take it with all your heart.
[12:11] Praise the name of our Lord. Be obedient
[12:13] to all the word. Then God will perform
[12:17] his promise.
[12:19] And that's what the Lord Jesus told them
[12:23] that you've heard
[12:25] about the promise of the father
[12:30] in Acts chapter one
[12:33] and then verse four. and being assembled
[12:36] together with them, commanded them that
[12:39] they should not depart from Jerusalem,
[12:41] but wait for the promise of the Father,
[12:44] which says he, "You've heard of me.
[13:02] For John truly baptized with water, but
[13:06] you shall be baptized with the Holy
[13:08] Ghost not many days hence.
[13:18] Praise the name of our Lord. He had
[13:20] walked with them three and a half years.
[13:23] He had resurrected
[13:25] and he had proved to them that have
[13:27] resurrected
[13:29] for 40 days. He walked amongst them.
[13:33] So the day he ascended up into heaven,
[13:36] he told them, you've heard of that
[13:38] promise
[13:40] and you are going to receive the spirit
[13:42] of God
[13:45] not many days from now.
[13:48] Praise the name of our Lord. So they had
[13:51] to wait.
[13:53] They had to turn for the baptism of the
[13:55] Holy Spirit. Then on the day of
[13:58] Pentecost,
[14:00] 10 days after the ascension of Jesus
[14:02] Christ,
[14:04] they were filled with the Holy Spirit.
[14:08] Praise the name of our Lord. The Holy
[14:10] Spirit came down
[14:12] to fulfill the promise of God
[14:17] to us now who are living at the time.
[14:22] When the Holy Spirit has already been
[14:25] given,
[14:28] the condition is
[14:31] repent and be baptized in the name of
[14:34] Jesus Christ.
[14:38] Acts 2:38
[14:41] for the remission of your sins,
[14:44] and you shall receive
[14:47] the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[14:50] That's the promise now we have is
[14:53] repent.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; So the question is have you repented?
[14:58] &gt;&gt; Be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[15:02] So have you been baptized in the name of
[15:04] Jesus Christ?
[15:06] And then he says you shall receive the
[15:08] gift of the Holy Ghost.
[15:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[15:14] message the uncertain sound,
[15:19] brother Brham says when he said in Acts
[15:22] 2:38,
[15:27] "Repent everyone
[15:31] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[15:33] Christ
[15:35] for the remission of your sins."
[15:39] There is no uncertain about that.
[15:47] There is no uncertain about that.
[15:53] You know, in other words, it is certain.
[16:02] You shall receive the gift of the Holy
[16:04] Ghost.
[16:07] Not you may be.
[16:12] Maybe you will,
[16:14] perhaps you ought to,
[16:18] but you will
[16:22] when
[16:24] you have repented.
[16:27] Praise the name of our Lord. So, it is
[16:29] not uncertain.
[16:33] It's not about guessing
[16:36] whether I'm going to get the baptism of
[16:37] the Holy Spirit or I'm not going to get
[16:40] the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[16:43] Because the Bible says, "The promise is
[16:46] unto you
[16:49] and to your children, and to as many as
[16:52] the Lord our God shall call."
[16:55] Now if you are confident
[16:58] and you are certain that God has called
[17:00] you
[17:03] then the promise is yours.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Move
[17:07] forward
[17:09] and then you tell God you have promised
[17:13] that when I repent and I am baptized in
[17:16] the name of Jesus,
[17:19] I receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[17:21] Lord, I need that spirit of the Lord.
[17:25] You You behave like Calb.
[17:29] Give me my mountain. Praise the name of
[17:32] the Lord. Give me the Holy Spirit
[17:35] because you have promised me the Holy
[17:36] Spirit. So then you move forward to
[17:39] receive the Holy Ghost.
[17:42] The Holy Spirit has already been given.
[17:46] Praise the name of the Lord. You're not
[17:48] going to say, "I don't know when the
[17:49] Holy Ghost will come.
[17:52] But the Holy Ghost has already been
[17:53] given. He has already been released here
[17:56] on earth.
[17:58] Praise the name of our Lord. Now what
[18:01] hinders the Holy Spirit
[18:03] is the condition of our hearts,
[18:08] the condition of our heart.
[18:11] Now,
[18:12] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says,
[18:14] &gt;&gt; he says, "Now
[18:19] you can go in there
[18:22] without repenting
[18:26] and you won't get it.
[18:30] But when you go suddenly repent
[18:35] and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[18:39] you are going to get it.
[18:43] Nothing uncertain.
[18:46] You shall receive the gift of the Holy
[18:49] Ghost.
[18:51] Is that right? Praise the name of our
[18:54] Lord. So now the whole thing comes back
[18:56] to us.
[18:59] How how are you determined to receive
[19:01] the baptism of the Holy Spirit?
[19:05] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[19:08] message the church and its condition,
[19:12] he says,
[19:20] "But you for all your rights.
[19:28] and all your friends
[19:31] and all your feelings
[19:33] and everything
[19:35] this morning
[19:38] and come here.
[19:40] You forfeited your rights to kneel down
[19:43] here and talk to God.
[19:49] I'm telling you by the word of the Lord
[19:53] that Christ said,
[19:55] "He that comes to me, I will in no wise
[19:59] cast out.
[20:03] While you are there on the altar,
[20:07] repent,
[20:09] while you're there on the altar,
[20:12] repent.
[20:14] Tell him that you are sorry.
[20:19] what you did.
[20:21] That's what's the matter
[20:24] with the people today.
[20:27] They don't receive the Holy Ghost
[20:30] when they are baptized.
[20:34] They just don't thoroughly repent.
[20:38] God is trying to give them the Holy
[20:40] Ghost.
[20:44] He wants you to be meek and gentle
[20:48] quiet.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you get up with the
[20:54] same selfishness in your heart.
[21:05] Or you might get up shouting,
[21:09] speaking in tongues. Oh any that
[21:13] wouldn't make you have the Holy Ghost.
[21:17] You got to get up from there a different
[21:19] person.
[21:22] You got to get up from there gentle,
[21:26] quiet,
[21:27] and meek, humble. God is spirit dwelling
[21:32] with you.
[21:35] Next year, look back down the trail.
[21:43] and see how far you have come.
[21:47] If you are gaining ground all the time,
[21:52] that's the Holy Spirit.
[21:55] The Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace,
[22:01] longsuffering,
[22:03] meekness,
[22:05] gentleness,
[22:06] patience, faith.
[22:10] Now just repent and tell God
[22:15] you want that right now.
[22:19] Be real good.
[22:22] Praise the name of our Lord. So brother
[22:24] Brandham is saying when you come
[22:28] you know to accept the Lord Jesus as
[22:30] your personal savior
[22:33] and then you don't thoroughly repent
[22:36] you can't then receive the Holy Spirit
[22:39] because it says repent every one of you.
[22:45] So then you make sure you thoroughly
[22:47] repent
[22:49] because the Lord knows all about us.
[22:53] So you open up, you pour out your heart
[22:55] to the Lord
[22:59] and tell God,
[23:01] Lord, forgive me for this thing that
[23:03] I've done.
[23:06] And you know one chapter which is
[23:08] interesting which we can learn from how
[23:10] to repent.
[23:14] When we go to Psalms 51,
[23:18] it teaches us how to repent.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. David was
[23:25] repenting
[23:27] about his sin of adultery and murder
[23:33] in Psalms 51 verse1.
[23:38] Have mercy upon me, oh God.
[23:42] You know, you go out yourself,
[23:46] you know, like Jacob,
[23:49] he wrestled with the angel,
[23:52] you know, that night. He was in
[23:55] desperation.
[24:00] You know, he wanted God to change him.
[24:03] And that should also be the same thing.
[24:07] God have mercy upon me in this kind of
[24:09] condition. Forgive
[24:12] me for this sin.
[24:14] Forgive me for this failure.
[24:17] David was crying to the Lord.
[24:20] Have mercy upon me.
[24:23] God, according to thy loving kindness,
[24:30] according unto the mouth of thy tender
[24:32] mercies,
[24:35] blot out my transgressions,
[24:39] wash me thoroughly from my iniquity
[24:44] and cleanse me from my sin.
[24:48] And then David said, "Acknowledge my
[24:50] transgressions.
[24:53] and my sin is ever before me.
[24:58] So then you go and make it right before
[25:00] God.
[25:03] Praise the name of our Lord. You tell
[25:05] God about your failures.
[25:08] You tell God about your weaknesses.
[25:11] Lord deliver me from this kind of
[25:13] situation.
[25:16] Then you surrender yourself to God
[25:20] to come and take over your life.
[25:24] Praise the name of our Lord. David said,
[25:26] "I acknowledge my transgression
[25:30] and my sin is ever before me.
[25:34] Against you only
[25:37] have I sinned and done this evil in thy
[25:41] sight."
[25:43] Praise the name of our Lord. And so
[25:45] David poured himself out to the Lord,
[25:50] &gt;&gt; you know, confessing his failures,
[25:55] &gt;&gt; all his weaknesses.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; And that's how we thoroughly repent.
[26:01] And then he says in verse 14,
[26:05] "Deliver me from blood guiltness.
[26:11] Oh God, thou art the God of my
[26:14] salvation,
[26:17] and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
[26:19] righteousness.
[26:23] Oh Lord, open my lips,
[26:27] and my mouth shall show forth thy
[26:29] praise.
[26:39] not sacrifice else I would give it.
[26:42] Though desirous not in burnt offerings.
[26:53] Then he says in verse 17,
[26:56] "The sacrifices of God
[27:00] are a broken spirit,
[27:05] a broken and a contrite heart,
[27:11] oh God, th will not despise."
[27:18] Praise the name of our Lord.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; It says, "When you are a broken heart,
[27:25] You know, say Lord,
[27:28] &gt;&gt; forgive me for this thing that I've done
[27:32] for a long time. I've been alcoholic.
[27:36] Lord, deliver me from this demon.
[27:40] For a long time I've been doing this
[27:41] kind of thing,
[27:44] from this kind of stress,
[27:47] I was born in this kind of stress.
[27:50] You know, you are making it known before
[27:53] God
[27:55] that you don't like the condition that
[27:57] you are going through.
[28:00] You don't like the state you are in
[28:04] like David. He never like the blood
[28:07] guiltiness.
[28:10] And then he said, "Lord, deliver me out
[28:12] of destruction.
[28:15] Deliver me out of this thing that I have
[28:17] done.
[28:20] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[28:22] God would desire our hearts to open up
[28:25] before him
[28:28] and say, "Lord, this is my situation.
[28:32] I need you to help me. I need you to
[28:35] deliver me." Praise the name of our
[28:38] Lord. When you allow God himself
[28:42] to come and take over your life,
[28:45] praise the name of our Lord. Now we see
[28:48] that in the scriptures
[28:51] after the day of Pentecost
[28:55] when they received the baptism of the
[28:57] Holy Spirit
[28:59] when Peter preached to the people who
[29:01] are there at Jerusalem.
[29:04] The Bible says 3,000 people were added
[29:08] to the church.
[29:12] So they received the what?
[29:15] They received the water baptism
[29:19] and then they also received the baptism
[29:21] of the Holy Spirit
[29:24] and that has been the principle
[29:28] what God has always been doing.
[29:32] Praise the name of our Lord. We see that
[29:34] even
[29:36] that when Saul rather when
[29:41] when Philip
[29:43] &gt;&gt; went to Samaria,
[29:45] &gt;&gt; he preached the word of God.
[29:48] They received the word of God. And then
[29:51] they were baptized in the water.
[29:54] But then the Holy Ghost was not yet
[29:56] given to them
[29:59] until they called for Peter.
[30:02] When Peter and John came and prayed over
[30:05] them,
[30:08] laying hands on them, they received of
[30:11] the Holy Spirit. And brother Brandham
[30:13] says
[30:15] Peter had the keys.
[30:18] He's the one who had the keys on the day
[30:21] of Pentecost.
[30:23] He used those keys to open the Holy
[30:25] Ghost to the Jews.
[30:30] Praise the name of our Lord. until the
[30:32] Jews rejected the gospel.
[30:36] And so when they rejected the gospel,
[30:39] then they wouldn't receive the Holy
[30:40] Ghost any further.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; So when he comes to Samaria in Acts
[30:45] chapter 8,
[30:48] Peter had the key still.
[30:51] So he's the one who opened the Holy
[30:53] Ghost to the Samarians
[30:56] until also they rejected the gospel.
[31:00] And now when he comes to to Acts chapter
[31:02] 10
[31:05] to the Gentiles,
[31:07] Peter had the keys also
[31:10] and he opened the Holy Ghost to
[31:12] Gentiles.
[31:16] Now from the time he opened the Holy
[31:18] Ghost to the Gentiles,
[31:21] from the time we open the Holy Ghost to
[31:24] the Gentiles,
[31:30] That door has never been closed.
[31:33] Praise the name of our Lord. It has
[31:36] never been closed. The Holy Ghost has
[31:39] already been given.
[31:41] So what we do? We receive the Holy
[31:44] Spirit. And how we receive the Holy
[31:47] Spirit
[31:49] by believing the true word of God,
[31:54] obeying that word of God. when the Holy
[31:57] Spirit comes down.
[32:00] So from the time Peter opened the Holy
[32:02] Ghost in the house of Cornelius,
[32:07] the Holy Spirit has never been taken
[32:09] back to heaven.
[32:12] Now what brother Brennham says
[32:15] that for 2,000 years,
[32:19] the Holy Spirit
[32:22] has been bound.
[32:25] How was the Holy Spirit bound?
[32:29] People rejecting the word of God.
[32:32] When people start teaching things
[32:34] contrary to the Holy Spirit,
[32:38] when people start believing things
[32:40] contrary to the word of God,
[32:45] then they bind the spirit of God.
[32:50] Praise the name of our Lord. I just want
[32:52] to get that message here.
[32:55] in the message the feast of the trumpet.
[33:00] Praise the name of our Lord.
[33:04] Let me read it.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 207.
[33:11] He says
[33:19] &gt;&gt; while this group down here has got 2,000
[33:23] bound at River Ephetes
[33:36] and been back for 2,000 years
[33:40] also The church
[33:43] has bound the Holy Ghost
[33:47] for nearly 2,000 years
[33:52] and mad back there
[33:58] and under the church ages.
[34:02] It has been bound
[34:04] not at river of
[34:08] but at the door of creeds and doggyas
[34:14] that the holy spirit
[34:17] cannot work in the church
[34:21] because of manmade system
[34:25] but she's going to be liberated
[34:29] she is coming back.
[34:34] That's what the Bible said.
[34:37] And praise the name of our Lord. He says
[34:40] the Holy Spirit
[34:42] is going to be liberated.
[34:45] How is the Holy Spirit liberated?
[34:48] By the restoration of the word of God.
[34:52] Praise the name of our Lord. The Holy
[34:55] Spirit is brought back.
[34:58] When people leave their creeds,
[35:01] when people leave their dog
[35:03] and then they receive the word of God
[35:06] and it is purity,
[35:09] then the Holy Spirit can have the
[35:12] liberty
[35:14] to fill those who are yearning for the
[35:16] Holy Spirit.
[35:18] Praise the name of our Lord. So we are
[35:20] living at the time
[35:23] where the Holy Spirit has been given.
[35:26] So we should also not bind the Holy
[35:29] Spirit
[35:31] by maybe our contrary things contrary to
[35:34] the word of God
[35:37] things that are contrary to the word of
[35:39] God.
[35:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[35:44] message the Pam church age
[35:49] he says we are reading from page 164.
[35:58] 164.
[36:00] Now remember,
[36:03] John the Baptist
[36:05] &gt;&gt; was both the prophet and the messenger
[36:08] of his day.
[36:13] He was filled with the Holy Ghost from
[36:15] his mother's womb.
[36:19] When he was baptizing in Jordan,
[36:24] the word of God Jesus
[36:27] came to him.
[36:29] The word always comes to the truly
[36:32] spiritfilled.
[36:37] That is the evidence of being filled
[36:39] with the Holy Ghost.
[36:43] That is what Jesus said
[36:46] would be the evidence.
[36:49] He said, "And I'll pray the father
[36:53] and he will send you another comforter
[36:56] that he may abide with you forever,
[37:00] even the spirit of truth,
[37:04] whom the world cannot receive."
[37:07] Now we know what truth is.
[37:11] Thy word is truth.
[37:14] John 17:17.
[37:17] Again in John 8:43,
[37:23] why don't you understand my speech
[37:27] even because you cannot hear my word?
[37:33] Did you notice that Jesus said
[37:38] that the world could not receive the
[37:40] Holy Spirit?
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Well, in this verse
[37:47] I just read,
[37:50] neither could they receive the word.
[37:54] Why? Because the spirit and the word are
[37:57] one.
[38:00] And if you have the spirit as the
[38:03] prophets,
[38:11] the word would come you
[38:15] would receive it.
[38:17] Praise the name of the Lord. So he says
[38:19] they wouldn't receive the Holy Spirit
[38:24] because they rejected the word.
[38:27] So when people reject Christ
[38:30] which is the word then they cannot
[38:32] receive the Holy Spirit.
[38:35] So then as
[38:38] the Holy Spirit has been given
[38:42] we need to receive the word
[38:45] obey the word then the Holy Spirit will
[38:48] come and fill us.
[38:50] Praise the name of our Lord. That's what
[38:53] happened when you read the book of Acts.
[38:57] in Samaria.
[38:58] They received the word. They obeyed the
[39:02] word by water baptism.
[39:06] And then the Holy Spirit
[39:09] filled them.
[39:11] Let us go to the book of Acts chapter 8.
[39:15] Praise the name of our Lord.
[39:18] The Bible says
[39:22] in verse 12,
[39:26] &gt;&gt; "But when they believed Philillip,
[39:28] preaching the things concerning the
[39:30] kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[39:33] Christ, they were baptized, both men and
[39:35] women.
[39:50] So they re believed the word of God.
[39:54] They were baptized in the name of Jesus
[39:56] Christ.
[39:58] And the Bible says even Simon himself
[40:01] the sorcerer.
[40:05] He was baptized
[40:07] and continued with Philillip
[40:10] wondering
[40:12] beholding the miracles and the signs
[40:14] which were done.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; So then Peter came in verse 14.
[40:21] Now when the apostles which were at
[40:23] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[40:25] received the word of God.
[40:33] They sent unto them Peter and John,
[40:37] who when they were calmed down, prayed
[40:40] for them that they might receive the
[40:42] Holy Ghost.
[40:48] For as yet he was fallen on none.
[41:01] So when they came down, prayed for them
[41:03] that they might receive the Holy Ghost.
[41:10] Verse 15. Okay.
[41:18] For as yet was fallen on none of them.
[41:26] They were baptized in the name of the
[41:28] Lord.
[41:31] So they laid hands on them
[41:34] and they received the Holy Ghost. Praise
[41:37] the name of our Lord. So they went all
[41:40] the way
[41:42] and they received
[41:44] the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Praise
[41:47] the name of our Lord. That should also
[41:49] be our desire
[41:52] to go all the way and receive the
[41:55] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[41:58] because the promise is unto us and to as
[42:02] many as the Lord our God shall call.
[42:06] And then you see that Simon the sorcerer
[42:10] when he saw that the apostles were
[42:12] laying hands on the people to receive
[42:14] the Holy Spirit
[42:18] for him he wanted to get the Holy Ghost
[42:20] in a different way
[42:23] by giving them the money and saying give
[42:26] me that power also.
[42:29] So you find that the heart of Simon,
[42:34] he never repented thoroughly.
[42:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[42:40] verse n in verse 18
[42:43] and when Simon saw that through the
[42:45] laying on of the apostles hands the Holy
[42:48] Ghost was given he offered them money.
[43:00] Give me also this power thatever I lay
[43:02] hands on, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
[43:11] But Peter said unto him, "Thy money
[43:14] perish with thee, because thou hast
[43:16] thought that the gift of God may be
[43:19] purchased with money.
[43:28] So he had wrong intentions.
[43:32] Praise the name of our Lord. He never
[43:34] got actually to repent thoroughly.
[43:39] He had a wrong attitude.
[43:42] He was also a mixed multitude.
[43:46] You know, like the Bible says, a mixed
[43:49] multitude left Egypt.
[43:54] They went through water baptism in the
[43:56] Red Sea
[43:58] and then they were going through the
[44:00] wilderness,
[44:02] a time of sanctification.
[44:05] And many of them perished in the
[44:07] wilderness.
[44:09] So now we shouldn't stop at
[44:11] sanctification.
[44:14] We shouldn't stop at justification.
[44:18] Go all the way.
[44:20] Praise the name of our Lord. Being
[44:22] baptized with baptism of the Holy
[44:23] Spirit.
[44:25] Praise the name of our Lord. I want us
[44:27] to go through another message again.
[44:32] In the message, honestly contending for
[44:35] the faith. Um,
[44:41] honestly contending for the faith.
[44:47] Now, sanctification is a cleansing,
[44:53] cleaning up the spirit,
[44:57] getting ready for the baptism of the
[44:59] Holy Spirit.
[45:02] Justification
[45:09] is believing on the Lord
[45:14] and you are justified.
[45:18] Romans 8 verse one.
[45:20] Therefore, being justified by faith,
[45:30] we have peace with God through our Lord
[45:32] Jesus Christ.
[45:37] Hebrews 13
[45:39] and 12
[45:41] is sanctification
[45:44] and Luke 24:49.
[45:48] He said in the city of Jerusalem
[45:55] until you are endured with power from on
[45:57] high.
[46:00] The first thing there is a glass lying
[46:04] on the hog pen.
[46:07] A glassy
[46:11] hog pen.
[46:18] You want to use it.
[46:20] The first thing you pick it up.
[46:25] That is justification.
[46:30] You've got it in your hand.
[46:34] You can't use it yet.
[46:37] It needs to be cleansed.
[46:42] Then you take it in,
[46:45] you wash it, you sterilize it,
[46:51] and takes all the germs out of it.
[46:57] That's what God does through sanctific
[47:05] takes all the desire of sin out of your
[47:08] heart.
[47:11] Cleans you up
[47:13] and then you are a candidate
[47:19] for the feeding of the Holy Spirit.
[47:23] Then the word sanctify
[47:27] means to be cleansed and set aside for
[47:31] service.
[47:36] The word sanctify.
[47:38] That's the Old Testament.
[47:42] The altar sanctified the vessels
[47:49] and cleansed and set aside for the
[47:52] service.
[47:56] not in service,
[48:00] but it has been set aside for service.
[48:05] And when it is in service,
[48:09] then he says, "Blessed are they that
[48:12] hunger
[48:15] and thirst after righteousness.
[48:23] for they shall be filled.
[48:27] So the Holy Spirit
[48:29] comes in
[48:31] and fills up that vessel
[48:35] till running over
[48:40] bubbling over
[48:42] and then you are in the service of the
[48:45] Lord.
[48:47] Praise the name of our Lord. It's a lot
[48:49] clearer now.
[48:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Like
[48:55] getting a glass from dust.
[48:59] You cannot use it in that condition.
[49:02] You want to use that glass.
[49:05] So the process of picking it out from
[49:07] the rubbish pit,
[49:12] you are justifying it like we also
[49:16] receive the gospel
[49:18] and accept the Lord Jesus as your
[49:20] personal savior
[49:22] and then you are baptized
[49:24] in the name of Jesus Christ. So you are
[49:28] justified.
[49:30] Praise the name of our Lord. All that
[49:33] you did before
[49:35] God has put them away.
[49:38] There is no more condemnation
[49:42] in the past that you have done.
[49:44] But in you, there is still a desire to
[49:48] go back and do those evil things.
[49:52] Already you have been picked from the
[49:54] dust.
[49:57] But then there are elements in that
[49:59] glass
[50:01] which are dangerous.
[50:04] Praise the name of our Lord. So you take
[50:06] that glass and start cleaning it.
[50:11] Either you boil water
[50:14] and there are many processes you can
[50:16] keep it clean.
[50:19] Killing the germs
[50:22] that is now sanctification.
[50:24] And God also can take her through the
[50:26] same processes of sanctification
[50:31] so that the desires of the things of the
[50:34] world
[50:37] can all be destroyed in our lives.
[50:42] If you have been going to nightclubs
[50:45] that go to the nightclub dies away.
[50:50] If you have been going to bars,
[50:55] that desire
[50:57] of of you know arranging like now people
[51:00] are at their places of work.
[51:04] They are saving money to spend over the
[51:05] weekend.
[51:08] So on Friday they have enough excuses to
[51:10] be at office only half a day.
[51:15] If maybe they are working up country
[51:21] Then they just come just shortly and
[51:23] then they travel to Campala.
[51:28] They have made programs.
[51:30] Today we are going to be at
[51:33] we are going to be at club or we are
[51:35] going to be at this kind of place
[51:38] or we are going to be at this kind of
[51:40] you know show.
[51:43] You know they are bound.
[51:46] And then those who who have good money,
[51:50] they know that on Friday I'm flying out
[51:52] maybe to Paris.
[51:55] So on Saturday or Sunday I'm spending a
[51:57] night in this kind of big show in some
[51:59] kind of place
[52:02] and I come back on Sunday night and then
[52:05] I'm back in my place of you know there
[52:08] is that thing that pulls them.
[52:12] There is a a a life the devil has put in
[52:15] them.
[52:17] There is a yearning the devil has put in
[52:19] them
[52:21] and draws them to those things which are
[52:23] evil.
[52:26] But now when you hear the word of God,
[52:29] the word of God separates you from that
[52:31] kind of nature
[52:35] and you hear going to disc.
[52:39] So when you are planning to save money
[52:41] for the discover
[52:47] and then say no
[52:49] and then maybe their clothes you used to
[52:51] put on to go to discourse,
[52:55] you start hating them or you throw them
[52:58] away. It may not be immediately
[53:03] but then it is a process that takes time
[53:05] in your life
[53:08] and then there are maybe those baits.
[53:14] Maybe they keep on calling you.
[53:18] You missing this.
[53:21] You find maybe they are disturbing you
[53:22] too much.
[53:24] you just kind of block their numbers
[53:28] or you change your contact, you are
[53:30] cutting off yourself from the old kind
[53:33] of attachment.
[53:37] Praise the name of our Lord. So you are
[53:39] under a process of being separated.
[53:44] You are being separated from that that
[53:46] old nature.
[53:50] You know the things that used to bind
[53:51] you,
[53:53] the things that used to take your time.
[53:57] So now the more you yield yourself to
[53:59] the word of God,
[54:02] the more you hear the word of God, the
[54:05] more the word of God changes your mind,
[54:10] you start hating the things you were
[54:12] doing.
[54:14] Praise the name of the Lord. So you need
[54:16] to avail yourself to the cleaning of
[54:18] your life.
[54:22] And the Bible says sanctify them through
[54:25] thy truth.
[54:28] For thy word is truth.
[54:30] So the more we come to the presence of
[54:32] God
[54:34] is the more we are washed,
[54:37] the more we are sanctified,
[54:40] the more we are separated from our
[54:42] weaknesses.
[54:44] And so you avail yourself
[54:48] and then you find that the things you
[54:49] used to like
[54:52] you know which were not appropriate
[54:56] you find that they are dying before you.
[55:00] You no longer miss those kind of clubs.
[55:04] You no longer miss those kind of funny
[55:06] competitions.
[55:11] You no longer miss those kind of
[55:13] fashions and styles.
[55:16] Oh, what is the new style? What is on
[55:19] the market now? You know, they are no
[55:21] longer traveling you. Praise the name of
[55:24] the Lord. You no longer miss those kind
[55:27] of groups or social things you go to.
[55:33] Praise the name of the Lord. So, it's a
[55:36] cleansing process.
[55:38] So he sanctifies us himself.
[55:42] But it depends on how much we are
[55:44] willing to be clean.
[55:49] The more you yield yourself
[55:52] is the more you are made better.
[55:55] Praise the name of he cleans you
[56:00] then he fills you. Praise the name of
[56:02] our lord. And brother Brandham says he
[56:06] makes your cup to run over.
[56:10] Praise the name of our Lord. So he
[56:13] sanctifies you. After he has sanctified
[56:16] you, then he fills you with his holy
[56:19] spirit.
[56:20] You used to long for the things of the
[56:22] world.
[56:25] But now you no longer long for the
[56:27] things of the world.
[56:30] You now long for the things of God.
[56:33] You thirst after righteousness.
[56:37] You thirst after truth.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So the Holy
[56:43] Spirit has already been given.
[56:48] So now as he has already been given
[56:52] then we go and receive it.
[56:55] Praise the name of God. Let me try so we
[56:58] can finish up.
[57:01] So we go to Acts chapter 19.
[57:07] Praise the name of our Lord.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; So there was Apollo and his group.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; They had received the wine.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; But it was not in the time. It was
[57:24] during the time of John the Baptist.
[57:28] John had baptized them
[57:32] and they believed that Jesus should be
[57:33] the Messiah.
[57:37] But then Jesus came and then the Holy
[57:40] Spirit also came.
[57:42] But then they were feeding on the food
[57:44] of yesterday.
[57:48] So when Paul asked him, "Have you
[57:51] received the Holy Spirit since you
[57:53] believed?
[57:57] He said, "I don't know if there be any
[57:58] Holy Spirit."
[58:01] So, we see that Apollos
[58:05] and his team,
[58:07] they had not received the full
[58:09] atonement.
[58:15] And that's what brother Brham talks
[58:16] about the foolish virgins
[58:22] that they never received the atonement
[58:24] in its fullness.
[58:29] In other words, going all the way to
[58:31] being filled with the Holy Spirit
[58:35] now. The Holy Spirit is available.
[58:38] We need to go and get our full
[58:40] atonement.
[58:43] We need to go and get our full
[58:46] atonement,
[58:48] our complete atonement.
[58:52] You know, Romans chapter 8 verse one.
[58:56] There is now no condemnation
[59:00] to those who are in Christ. So that
[59:03] should always be our desire
[59:06] that you are in Christ,
[59:09] the life of Jesus Christ.
[59:12] living in you. Praise the name of our
[59:14] Lord. Not what you try to do,
[59:18] but the spirit of God that lives in you,
[59:22] guiding you and directing you in
[59:25] everything.
[59:27] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[59:29] receive the whole atonement.
[59:33] And the whole atonement
[59:36] comes by the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[59:40] This life of Jesus Christ
[59:43] living in us. Praise the name of our
[59:45] Lord. The Holy Spirit has already been
[59:47] given. So what do we do? Receive the
[59:51] Holy Spirit. And it's not difficult.
[59:55] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[59:57] read all these instances in the
[59:58] scriptures,
[1:00:01] it was not difficult to get the baptism
[1:00:03] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:00:06] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[1:00:08] sure need the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:10] Spirit. You need the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:12] Spirit
[1:00:14] to live a victorious life
[1:00:17] in the name of our Lord. That should be
[1:00:19] your desire.
[1:00:22] And don't say maybe that will be the end
[1:00:23] of it.
[1:00:30] If you wait for 10 years, 5 years, 30
[1:00:34] years, you don't need to do that. Why?
[1:00:38] The Holy Ghost has already been given.
[1:00:42] You just receive it by obedience to the
[1:00:45] word of God.
[1:00:48] Amen. Amen. Let us read this as our last
[1:00:50] scripture. I believe
[1:00:55] Acts chapter 5
[1:00:58] and then verse 32.
[1:01:02] The Bible says,
[1:01:09] And we are his witnesses of these
[1:01:12] things. And so is also the Holy Ghost
[1:01:15] whom God has given to them that obey
[1:01:19] him.
[1:01:27] Praise the name of our Lord. It says
[1:01:29] God,
[1:01:32] he has given the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:35] to those that obey him.
[1:01:38] But then my question comes to this
[1:01:42] why would you accept the Lord Jesus as
[1:01:44] your personal savior
[1:01:47] if you don't want to obey him?
[1:01:50] You start wondering
[1:01:52] where you come from there if you don't
[1:01:55] want to go all the way.
[1:01:58] Praise the name of our Lord. So as you
[1:02:00] accepted him as your personal savior
[1:02:04] just be obedient to the word of God
[1:02:07] and the Holy Spirit comes down.
[1:02:11] John 14 verse 21 and verse 23.
[1:02:16] He that loveth me,
[1:02:19] it is he that keeps my word.
[1:02:24] And he that keeps my word
[1:02:26] will be loved of my father. And we will
[1:02:30] come and manifest ourself to him.
[1:02:33] And we will come and make our abode in
[1:02:36] him.
[1:02:38] That means he fills you with his
[1:02:41] presence.
[1:02:43] He fills you with his own life.
[1:02:46] He has given us the word. So he's
[1:02:48] waiting on us. What is our response to
[1:02:51] the word that has been given?
[1:02:54] You obey that word. You get the union
[1:02:58] with him.
[1:03:00] Praise the name of our Lord. He comes
[1:03:02] and abides in us
[1:03:05] because you have given him your life.
[1:03:08] So it should not be difficult.
[1:03:11] Praise the name of our Lord. Giving your
[1:03:13] life to the Lord Jesus.
[1:03:16] just surrendering yourself and then the
[1:03:19] spirit of God comes down and then you
[1:03:23] live the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; May God bless you.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Let us sing that song. The comforter
[1:03:34] abides.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:03:41] Let me get you.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[1:03:47] the way for the hand of God in me in
[1:03:54] abound.
[1:03:57] That's the reason of my pleas. Yes, the
[1:04:02] sacred all is this. Thou the comforter
[1:04:08] abides. Please.

[1:04:30] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[1:04:36] the praying way for the comfort

[1:04:48] Once my heart was full of sin. Once I
[1:04:53] had no peace with him. till I heard how
[1:04:58] Jesus died upon the tree.
[1:05:05] Then I fell down at his feet and there
[1:05:11] came a sweet. Now the comforter
[1:05:17] abides
[1:05:18] with me. Oh, he abides.
[1:05:23] He abide.

[1:05:36] with him.
[1:05:40] I'm rejoicing night and day
[1:05:45] as I walk the spring.
[1:05:49] for the comforter
[1:05:52] abides
[1:05:54] with me.
[1:05:57] Oh, he is with me everywhere
[1:06:03] and he knows my every care. I'm as happy
[1:06:10] as above. I'm just as free
[1:06:16] for the spirit has control.
[1:06:21] Jesus satisfies
[1:06:24] my soul. Since the comforter
[1:06:29] abides
[1:06:30] with me, oh he abides
[1:06:35] in
[1:06:37] he abiding.
[1:06:41] Oh, he abides.
[1:06:44] Halleluah.
[1:06:46] He abides
[1:06:48] with me.
[1:06:53] I'm rejoice
[1:06:55] night and day.
[1:06:57] As I walk the narrow way,
[1:07:02] for the comforter
[1:07:05] abides
[1:07:06] with me.
[1:07:10] And now there is hope for the things
[1:07:15] of the world have taken wings. Long ago
[1:07:21] I gave them an instant rain.
[1:07:28] Oh all my night was standing.
[1:07:33] All my bens rolled away.
[1:07:38] Now your comforter
[1:07:41] abides
[1:07:42] with
[1:07:44] Oh, he abides.
[1:07:49] He abides.
[1:07:52] He abide.

[1:07:58] He abide
[1:08:01] with me.

[1:08:19] with me. Amen. Praise the name of the
[1:08:22] Lord. He abides. That's a beautiful
[1:08:25] confession. He abides within me. Praise
[1:08:28] the name of the Lord. You accepted him
[1:08:30] as your personal savior not to deny him
[1:08:33] along the way but to take him all the
[1:08:36] way. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[1:08:38] sing that song. Glory to his name as we

[1:23:30] a beautiful
[1:23:33] home of the soul
[1:23:42] by Jesus
[1:23:44] on high.
[1:23:47] There we never
[1:23:50] shout down.
[1:23:53] This a land where will never
[1:23:58] grow old.
[1:24:04] Never
[1:24:06] grow old.
[1:24:09] never
[1:24:12] grow up
[1:24:14] in a land where
[1:24:18] never
[1:24:20] grow old.
[1:24:24] Never
[1:24:26] grow old.
[1:24:29] Never
[1:24:31] grow home.
[1:24:34] It's a land where we'll never
[1:24:39] grow old.
[1:24:42] When our work
[1:24:45] lies down
[1:24:48] and our life
[1:24:51] crowd is one
[1:24:54] and our trles
[1:24:57] and trials
[1:25:00] are over.
[1:25:05] All our sorrow
[1:25:09] will end
[1:25:11] and our voicees
[1:25:14] will play
[1:25:17] with the love ones
[1:25:21] of gone
[1:25:23] before.
[1:25:28] Never
[1:25:30] grow old.
[1:25:34] never
[1:25:37] grow old.
[1:25:39] This a land where will never
[1:25:45] grow.
[1:25:48] Never
[1:25:50] grow old.
[1:25:54] Ever
[1:25:59] this alive?
