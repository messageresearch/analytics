dri the to airport and I don't know whether I'll be able to come back myself because the roads to will be blocked tomorrow because there are so many dignitaries that are coming in and his PL is morning flight we pray that everything goes well so I ask the ministers that have taken off their Sunday to come and listen for in respect of time just stand up for recognition among these people the ministers if you can stand amen amen these are men who hold this sword amen and they deserve double honor that's what Paul Tau us amen they Hazard their lives to go and attack the enemy to bring the purchase of the blood into the presence of the Lord you are highly respected God bless you so much thank you for coming amen so uh before we go the pastor Doo and his wife Pauline are here are you here yeah and uh sister paen uh they inv me to dedicate their baby so as they walk forward we just sing that little song bring them in bring them in bring in bring in from the F of s bring them [Music] bring bring little want to [Applause] Jesus praise the Lord you see when I see pastors having children it looks strange to me but then I start remembering at one time I was pastoring and having children children are blessing from the [Music] Lord and um one time you know in a very big congregation bigger than this you know the parents brought their children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked him you are wasting time we got so many other things to do but it displeases the Lord the lord loves children amen and he also advises us that if we are going to make it back home we must have the faith of the child believe the father in Simplicity you see I've got my grandchildren if I ever open my mouth and bring them a car like mine they'll believe it and when I go back home says D where is the car so we need to have a Fai like that of Little Children if we have to enter into the Kingdom so Jesus proceeded he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and also blessed them are you together with me the parents just wanted let him touch them and the disciples said no no no no no but when Jesus allowed them to be BR he didn't only touch them so blessed and this is what we call the dedication of children none of the children are baptized but we bring them before the master so that he can touch them and he can bless them and protect them give them a good work and bring them to the altar say Jesus is Lord of M that's what we we are going to do this evening before we get our brother come speak to us amen amen so in our hands here we've got Emmanuel Doo and this Emmanuel This Little Child be a testimony that the Lord is a resident in this family amen Emmanuel God With Us let's B heads bless this little baby precious Heavenly Father we know that children are a gift from the Lord you give them to us Lord just to be be a way that you teach us father how to deal with the children and that way we can even recognize ourselves being your child they can make mistakes and we take it with Grace just like when we make mistakes father you receive Us by Grace you told us in the scripture that a minister must be a man who has brought up his children well and father this is what they are doing to raise the children in the fear of the Lord they know you give and they are giving back to you so in the name of Jesus I pray special blessing upon this little baby that father you may watch over him and take step with him help him heavenly father when the enemy tries to reach out his to touch we rebuke the enemy and we also pray that you may break every genetic chain that is negative and attaching itself upon this baby may this baby be free from the hand of the enemy that stretches to destroy I father I also pray in the name of Jesus that you may bless the father and father with their life that they walk that they may be a positive influence we also pray heavenly father that you may provide for them that they may take care of him we commit him into your heart if they appear tomorrow you us to witness Heavenly Father as he walks forward to take a Christ personally as his savior in Jesus name we [Applause] amen God bless you amen God bless you yes sir now when I was out in at lunch with the brother when I remember a brother who gave me a testimony uh he's called brother dra Fair brother dra fa is a pastor in one of the churches in Canada so he went to another church in edmont to preach in the middle of the service he got lost you know it's a very pathetic thing when a minister gets lost in the middle of a service sometimes you people think it to preach but it is not so when he got lost he just went back again into preaching the basics women don't put on clothes women must have their hair long boys you must you know he went around and Bap in Jesus he went around the he called the church to prayer and said amen he excused himself because he considered himself a defeated preacher so that he can walk away before you know he interacts with the people so three months later or so they went fishing and one of the brothers came from that church where he and so he said oh brother nice to see you he says yeah yeah yeah says I'm brother so and so and I come from such and such a church he said my heart dropped to the because I knew he was going to talk about that service he says that's exactly what he did he said do you remember that service when you came to our church he said yes yes sir and then he says that was the best service ever he says I looked him in the face I said how can you say that say you know we had two ladies they used to come to church they really loved coming to church they would dress well coming to church but outside there they were as wild as the world can be clothes and all kinds of stuff he says when you preached they ran home they got their clothes set them on fire and says the mother started shouting at them says what's happening to you they preached back to her and she also brought her clothes and they were back and he says the following week the three were baptized so God knows how to use this Serv amen God bless you as you listen to brother [Applause] welome is this loud enough can hear me at the back now is got alive again I would like to appreciate and thank brother for inviting me and I would like to say God bless you to him even though is not at this I must also mention special thanks to God bless you like I did in the morning I'm going to tell you I'm going to preach for 1 hour so the service this afternoon will be 1 hour until qu to 5 and that's as the Lord leads and I believe he has already led me say 1 hour the sometimes when you are landing and the weather is not very good you make a short nearby cir to land after 5 or 10 minutes I may go on until 5 but to finish I'm going to be looking at you and and asking God for a message again this afternoon I'll start off with a little testimony I had gathered people from our church in har for the usual service people from out of town I had invited them in and from a place about 240 200 kilm away they recruited a person who was not yet born again so he was sitting in the church he was a man of course I'm saying here when you look at him back view if you look at him back view you would think he's a woman because his hair was long down to there and it's a shame for a man to have long hair like that saying it is Paul who said it in Corinthians 11 it's a shame so I preached repentance and I made an altar call which I didn't do this morning I believe the Holy Ghost spoke to somebody and after the altar call this man repented gave his life to the Lord we had two Services we took a break for about 2 hours and that man young man rushed to the bar got a clean haircut like me like this from Mr dread to Mr baldheaded so I was told I was so excited I said hey young man come giving his testimony he was sitting at the balcony we do have a balcony at church he was sitting way up there so under the balcony yes he was under the balcony stood up then he walked to the front he came and stood by me I gave him a [Music] hug this didn't happen that time and I was so happy and the church wasy so re we're not preaching to win an argument preach get this house wonder if I should just go on with this testimonies it's only one hour I want to speak something so I read my scripture shortly when the boy was coming the platform he was a worldly boy with worldly posture he dealt with was just the hair at that time walking to the pit he was walking you see how I'm walking like a man so the walk had not been dealt with [Music] but the hair was dealt with one thing at a time where the [Music] tree will fall so when I saw his walk I knew there's more work to be done but when I saw his head I said there's been a lot of work done so we're not looking for overnight jobs not what I used to be I haven't become what I should be but I thank God because of the work in progress so when we talk about something you are not proper regarding don't tell us about your successes the great works you have done we're talking about your hair sort that out and when we find your hair is fine and you can touch it then you find us talking about something else because we preparing for the Rapture has made amen so let me draw your attention to a scripture reading around which I will talk for about an hour give me Revelation chap I'll read verse one to speak a little more on the others as well remember in the morning we said something we said when saw what was happening in Athens his Spirit was he responded what he saw he could not ignore it then I gave an example to say if I see an ugly snake coming in respond and then proceed with whatever and this afternoon I'm drawing your attention to John the of pmos he was instructed in chapter one what you see write in a book and send the book the seven churches in Asia so here we reading and I saw he is on a mission to see and he comments on what he sees That's What I Call preaching if I see I must respond depending on who I am I may be rough or polite but I'm I saw in the right hand of him that set on the throne within and on the back side and sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals there and no man in heaven no man in earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their and I responded what is John responding may God grant more joh who see and respond when John went to Athens he idat and he responded when John went to heaven he saw invitation and discovered there was no man Worthy he responded and we see people in the church as ha as they can be shame on brother is not the type of the scripture what he saw when when he good he responds good when he bad he responds bad but not IND these are not customers who up for bread as long as they have their money for bread bring it to me here is your bread are the pies of the blood of Jesus Christ so when there was no man found I wept much what was that verse five verse four I wept much because no man was able to open the book and one of the ERS said to me you are correct in Weeping that's not the situation on the ground the real matter is the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to take the book and lose the seals there so even though I cry when I see something I hope there is this elder somewhere who tells me don't weep the solution is in place that's not theight final position of that girl the final of that boy don't the girl is going to sort don't we the boy is going to sort himself out don't we the Believers are going to be message Believers what I see call upon a weeping time knows is watch in the heart that person is a Hollywood look she is the best believer we have we have is this when you look at her you can weep six husbands what a bad story when you look at RAB you are supposed to weep what a terrible shape the woman is in Mr spy she is the best I have in Jero I am not weeping I know God has never left himself without a witness let's pray gracious God help me Lord to be sensitive to your Holy Spirit and say nothing out of arrogance or Pride or hypocrisy Min the Holy Ghost need of the believer what's in their heart what their cry is and you know the answer one time you said to Philip give these people food and he says we don't have enough money to service these people with bread but Jesus knew what he was going to do so we realize when we preach though we speak of solutions but we have none Jesus himself knows what he's going to do we don't have to fight for anything or protect anything but we just surrender to him to say thy will be done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ please seated I'm going to just do a little thing again this afternoon with my friends I saw them I saw you thank you for raising them ministers take your notebooks take your notebooks yeah where you write your notes I know ministers when preaching they say I can preach that one better but I want to take you you to take your notebook anyone else can do the same I want to ask you a question but I'm not going to ask you for an answer in if you come and give me an answer in this room it would be very painful for me to say that's wrong brother so I want you to write the answer to this question the question is what is the first seal do you hear the question what is the first seal so you write your answer on the first SE is then you write don't write a book just a summary of what the first series did you hear the question sister allow to write your answer also my question is what is the first se you don't have I give him a piece of paper he's a pastor I want him to write probably you are the one I'm going to ask to come and show me your what is the first my time this afternoon is so short I can't really preach a message teach you something comprehensively so we just going to talk around the word this way have you WR your answer what is the first seal please be free to come I just see it I won't tell them I want to see your answer you want to interpret the answer take a seat my brother brother can I see your answer say yes now him the one who is serious and having faith for not being called yes you my friend no I want him the one you have no paper they have no paper can you take a piece of paper and give him but you come now give him a piece of paper there in the audience brother come where is he going out with the baby he's not showing up let me go go this side you come my friend I must not show any expression I must look serious I want somebody else to come thank you my brother this I need an interpreter M uh this is so beautiful I want to take a photo of the of the answer I'll ask Brother Richard to interpret it for me thank you brother is is brother is with the baby still do you know men also [Music] breastfeed let me not talk about that but Elohim was breast feeding Adam Abraham and he says I am the breasted father so that's what brother is doing this his Shai moment who is another Pastor brother happy I want to see you two come they not pastors they are refusing to be pastors okay come brother and you and you God bless you come brother did you come you have okay I need three more from there and three more from there so please come if you haven't come come yes come my brother I can't I can't read that wait where is my camera to save time I brother you you read this for me because you may have time to do that yes who else wants to come but I think I've got an idea come my brother you thank you where about God bless you so now I'm going to say something I'm sorry I don't know what I'm doing wrong I can change this position somewhere in my jacket and see whether will have peace I saw in the right hand of him that set on the throne a book written within and without Seven Seals and the Seven Seals have seal number one seal number two seal number three four five 6 and as a Believer you need to know what the first seal is but if your ABCs are not correct you will write the wrong let me put it this way I hope it's acceptable brother let me put it this way of the answers I got let me say there was a wrong answer somewhere brother you didn't even greet [Music] [Applause] me what if this was an excuse for me to give you a handshake so you better come back for your handshake where is yours right WR it here give us give us a pen come around you can give him the pen then give me the handshake now you can go is is there one of the pastors who want me to announce their answer to the church or you want me to keep it a secret is your hand up oh he a cameraman so did you notice the pastors don't want me to announce he got it right he got it WR he got it wrong also it won't be right for me to do that but it's also right for me to tell you that some of them got it wrong now that's very difficult very difficult because what it means is although I am asking about the first seal I'm also asking where they stand with the ABCs if it's not correct the first seal will be wrong but the word Pastor is not going to be negotiated this man remains a pastor even though he doesn't see the f because the word Pastor is what I live by the word Pastor the name Pastor is what I live by that's my job so if the first seal and indeed if none of the seals are revealed it means this book is still sealed if this book is sealed there is response must be crying you cannot celebrate when the book has failed to be opened no you can't celebrate celebration is when the book is number one taken number two you can celebrate I am standing here and the first seal is closed to me you have no cration somebody say Amen somewhere let's Cate there's no celebration the seal is not open it's time to [Applause] cry so I wept much can you put it back verse four I wept much if you hear that there is a pastor who didn't know what the first seal was here all our celebration must stop it's time to weep Uganda Uganda time to weep but I'm not going to tell you who was who and who was who God was watching it and the scripture is also there looking at you it saw your answer was wrong it saw the seal was not open to you and because it was not open if I am Jo I must wh why the brother doesn't know the F that's a major eventer that's ajor event the solution in verse the lion of the tribe of Judah opened it and this is how it happened in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God and the lamb came and took the [Applause] book out of the right hand of him that set on the throne when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the 24 Elders fell down before the left to break the success of the Lamb fell down to worship has not joined in yet but in heaven the beasts are ecstatic the 24 Elders are celebrating John is watching and then when he saw uh the lamb being woried by the beasts and the 24 Elders presenting the orders which are the prayers of the Saints first n says they sang a new song singing is entertainment if the book is closed singing yes you only see and worship because of a revelation because of attendance pres was he attended this but before opening he had no song the ERS had no song The no s when the book was opened then the elders said then the Beast sing then the prayers were presented you have redeemed us unto God out of every Kindred and nation and town and people you have met us Kings and Priests and we shall r on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels now celebrating why because the book was open let me say it this way Brothers the book is to be open you are ministers I'm preaching to ministers this afternoon you are ministers the people are waiting to celebrate they are the Nations go back to 10 keep going so they passing the kindred the tongues the people are waiting to celebrate the opening they were there all the time but before the book was open you didn't know about them before the book was open didn't know what the Angels were doing when the book was open then these are now featuring and keep going so he has made us Kings and Priests have on the earth and keep going and I beheld many angels coming to view they're also singing and celebrating inumerable Angels 10,000 time 10,000 keep going and after they they were saying is the Lamb when the book is opened you release true worship in the church when you are ignorant what the book revealed is a group an Entertainment Group it's a silent Heaven there's no song there's no worship you don't even know the Angels there Nation the tongues the peoples the elders the Beast are all waiting for this book to be open and if I say what is the fa SE if you get that wrong it means also that you don't know the second it also means you don't know the third and the four and the fth and if you don't know then that church is English is very difficult it's not my mother tongue so if I say you are miserable it's like I'm pouring contempt on you you are a church where the have not revealed the group is no cause for cration let me try and rush and John verse says keep going I want to see verse 13 yes thank you byee John started say the word I saying I I saying so John is saying they head I say and brother says I in English that means head me saying the one who was head saying blessing and honor and glory and Power in English without a revelation it's like John hear somebody saying but according to the prophet the one who is saying blessing and glory and honor and [Applause] power is I I who but the one who is saying these things was the one who was weeping so the one who has not paid attention to the ABCs you have nothing to celebrate then when the Revelation strikes you have sorted out the ABCs your to change from weeping mode to Celebration mode but we have people who should be crying we see C you hold the mic the form and they celebrate and they know nothing I'm not pouring scone on you but I'm about did joh Cate no he cried did he cry forever it was revealed he saw the book being open he saw the first SE oh you know we are living in time so I'm wanting to get into something but I'm looking at the watch now and say I get it when had open the first SE there was a white horse so in the church look at your notes what did you write you WR the first seal is the white hor you probably wrot it look at your notes there are some of you who wrote White Horse just say I don't see voice did some of you write [Music] white some did did some of you write the first is the devil the Antichrist is Antichrist God or the devil are you listening to me I've run out of time is the Antichrist Jesus Christ I want you to answer me yes or no they angry they not answering I will ask again I want you to answer so I can hear you is the Antichrist the white hor Rider is that Jesus Christ or is the devil thank you now somebody wrot first seal is the white horse rider the Antichrist that would mean the first seal is the devil the question was what is the first are you with me pastors what is the first seal and you wrote maybe I have to choose my way properly I'm stepping on Dangerous Ground here if you wrote White was Antichrist you are telling me the first seal is the devil do you understand that now I want somebody to show some life I'm pushy this afternoon let me push hard so don't just be quiet iard man I was working with whatever you say is what he was thinking if you say this is e yes if you come back you say no I found out this is East that's what I was saying I say you saying is there now is there and you're saying that's what I was saying so whatever you say that's what you are saying so whatever I tell you is the right answer is what you will saying I want to make it tight are you with me Pastor I want to make it tight I want to say this because because I don't have time if you wrot the first seal is the Antichrist you are saying the first seal is the devil and if you say the first seal is the devil then yours are not refilled are you following my argument and if the first seal is not revealed and you're calling the faceal the devil it means there's something that caused it for you not to know what the is because the face seal is not the dev and I'm going to read one quotation because I'm racing After Time looking for it first I didn't have good notes for this I am not getting it I'm trying again I'm trying again the third time yes can you open this statement what is the opening of seals then what is the opening of seals then is it there yeah come down 308 308 8 yes thank you there is 308 we are talking about Jesus Christ pastors Church those who don't obey in these little things will miss it in these other things which are the other things the seals if you got it wrong it means there is little things you are stepping over causing you not to get these things so what are the Seals and if I say it you can go and repeat it doesn't mean it's revealed but at least you can repeat it is the one who open the seals so let's ask a few questions who open the seal Jesus Christ all right and when he opened what came out the devil but my question was what is the F so let's read on please underline you have covered my my quotation I had read this one he is the one who opened the seals I was going to the next line yeah no that line he is something else is happening but I want line number that one I've read so thank you very much now the next one is what I want you to highlight thank you there that I want the church to see that Church let's read this together he is those seals who Christ is the devil the seals no and if you say the first is Antichrist are you correct or are you wrong and what closed your sight so go back to the drawing board fix up there if yours is fine like this and your wife is not you are to blame the brothers are not saying amen if you have a ha the one who is being blamed is the man if the ABC is about hair and shoes and things where like the pastor say at the end of the service why would you want to cut your dress on the side fashion what is fashion the Bible Bible says dress up so if those things are not in place then I'll will ask your husband what is the first maybe I'll ask your pastor what is the first thing he may know what is blocking him the ab that's how important those things are can you say Amen so he who Jesus is those seal so what is the first seal somebody wrote that but they said first is the word don't know what they meant but there it is the seals is Christ the seals is the word and Christ is the word go to the next Skip One phrase go to the next phrase fast this time after where you were highlighting you skip that phrase go to the next one and no above above after the word Christ the phrase starts after the No No I want from end I must be strict with you sir ahuh now we are there does it matter no it doesn't those are the little things I'm talking about he must get it right there and then he will be a candidate for the festival and Christ you didn't finish this the phrase phras is from one break to the next break so starting there no Christ as the Ser car on until the end of the phrase thank you now let's read it together I'm just doing it so the church is with me chch read with me and Christ is the seals that was opened the first seal is the first seal of the seals that was opened and who is the first Christ who is the second seal who is the third seal who is the fourth seal so what go to the next one which is in blue and highlight the whole phrase that one and the next now let's read it together I got five minutes so I'm just about to what is the opening of the seals then answer for me so there's something wrong with reading the book of the seals and seeing the first seal as the white horse rider if I say that statement you should have a revelation on it not repeat it without knowing what you are saying so the f is not the white hor rer the second seal is not the red horse rider the third seal is not the black horse rider these rers are in a serious provision where Christ is being revealed there is something else you see but seeing it doesn't make it part of the program if you go to Uganda and you go to Ginger and you see this man there you have not seen a Ugandan you just seen a man in Uganda but he not ug I don't have a birth certificate don't have an ID uh you call it ID yes I don't have a passport but I am in there in Uganda Uganda I breathing Uganda eating Uganda fish eating Uganda y I'm preaching to Uganda people I am not Uganda so if you forced to call me a Ugandan just because you sported me G and if you see a white rer when the f is being revealed and you call that Christ you are wrong it's there where Christ is being revealed but it's not the for you who want to stud further if you open re Genesis 1 there was a garden there in the garden was Jesus Christ but in the same Garden was another tree but that other tree was not the tree where we eat from is forbidden to eat from that tree and when you look at the seals and you see white the Holy Ghost if other things are in place tell you that is not Jesus that is the Antichrist and the thing I want to close with when the seals are revealed you are getting a discharge of power because the revelation of the seals have to do with the church and the church the Gate of Hell shall not prevail and when you get a revelation you're getting the power to overcome the gates of and when there's no Revelation your life will be marked by lack of power to overcome what God wants overcome and the Revelation carries the power so I feel to read one last quotation I think I'm still okay with my time I got two more minutes until qu 2 and 16 minutes until 5:00 I'm going to seek for this quotation I don't know where to get it but I'll find it oh my okay I think I am too far away there uh I'm going to look for it it's in the fifth seal I must read it because I will not be happy if I can't okay so let's go to the fifth seal F seal and I'm going to type in Power released you found it okay yeah I got it def you already open the fifth seal go to paragraph 140 our paragraphs are the same okay don't forget this church and you Brethren on tape you got it let's go to this is now paragraph 140 but yours is not showing so where it says don't is paragraph 14 and don't forget get before that end is now paragraph 140 I'm going to be very basic Now read after me don't forget this church give them a chance to say it okay I'll start again don't forget this church and you Brethren on tape I want you to examine this how could men do anything else besides the power of God that was released to them the so the first seal is talking about the victory of the church granted by Jesus in the he releases a power and that power is what the church lives by but if that church has not done the ABC he doesn't reveal what they need to overc so they will be a defeated you go to the second God releases a power overcomes the threats and without that Revelation the threat overwhelms you you run after the enemy thinking you running after Christ so now people stand before people say receive receive if you want money receive what are you chasing money what are you chasing the wrong [Applause] Rider but Christ has released the power that makes the True Believer overcome first of all he overcomes by obeying instructions about the hell then God P his anointing of the age to make them see it's wrong so what John had happening to him the thing that John had which happened to him was this when the first open he saw Christ I won't prove that this afternoon when he saw Christ he also saw where the enemy was and if you are there in that time and you see the enemy but calling Christ you will be like if sees the serpent calls a [Applause] husband it's the wrong person to have a baby with you know about the seity she mistook the identity of this Rider believed this Rider followed this Rider and was destroyed by and if you call the white horse rider Christ you follow that Rider he will deceive you he will destroy you and then your crying becomes ped crying as well amen I want to read There are some clouds so I'm failing to land the wind is too fast so I'm doing another Short Round do me a favor put Revelations 3 ver4 to 20 you got it and unto the angel of the Church of laia right I know your works and I complain about them so no pra here neither 16 17 because you say I am rich and increased in I have need of that Prosperity Gospel is being preached by loud here because they don't see the deception that is in it and because they don't see that they boast money I don't go back there we dealt with it yesterday but while they boasting they're riched they're miserable they're blind they're poor they're naked that's the spirit that's catching us we are not awake and the prophet says real things and Lasting things come from God without money and this loud is here is please open how can I overcome uh try with this he caught them who looked for that he caught them who looked for that thank you now he's on the ball God bless you my brother what is his name I want to remember his Henry Henry Henry God bless you Henry we c those who looked for that so will he come to each New Testament sa the ones that overcome every denominational critic who has ever overcome all the popular sins of the day there are popular popular are called fashion and what do you do sister you overcome the popular of the day and as ministers we have to keep an eye on those popular scenes the one I was telling the church recently was you take a photo then you post to Africa Africa West Africa West Africa South Africa South Africa and millions of people look and say this girl is pretty and they commit adul with you shame on you but it's terrible I wish I was young so I could hit this with with youth as well let's go to this popular sins and then beyond that popular sins of this age that we live in now like Jesus did in all the other ages those who overcome in each of their Church age so when you in Ephesus you must overcome when in when in every age you need to overcome now coming to loud because you say I'm rich that's the popular to be rich so who must what must you do overcome overcome what the popular scene in ginger there's a popular scene I don't know the pastor knows you about that in Cala there's popular night SPS yeah night SP night SP joints and other joints things that they used do which are popular unscriptural sweeping them just like that is here you must defeat those and in loud here please underline that one there where it says I rich that s before those who no before those who before overcome uhuh those who overcome yeah that's what I want those who overcome go back those who overcome what right there is my question as I close those who overcome overcome what what do they overcome brother I was there yesterday Now read that from the back I'm not making a spectacle of you but please stand up going to ask you without a mic those who overcome what I am rich did you hear him I think I can close my pastor because in loud is here there's so much pressure ones and the rer was a white horse rider in I have quotations here which says riches saying I am rich uses the spirit of deception so the spirit of deception is the white hor Rider now there is the white and the red and the black all in one to try and catch the last day believer you must have is what makes you overcome that overcomes overcome what in Ephesus and P the white hor in the red in Philadelphia the black and in the three together so a little deception withes a little threat and a little selling of Ministries with the then you are gone but Church Watch and Pray fear not little flock is the Father's Good Will to give you the kingom can I just say a word of prayer before I over to the pastor this and if you say Lord remember me I have repented many things but I have things to sort out in my life have mercy upon me Lord just raise your hand stand up say Lord remember me and help me Lord let's pray Lord Jesus it's rare for me to make an altar call I have closed I have said if somebody is here who says I'm sorry Lord I should not have followed the things that I was pursuing in this life I was doing the wrong things forgive me Lord have mercy on such have mercy on everyone Lord saying I'm sorry Lord and give them of your Holy Spirit the anointing that causes them to overcome in this end time overcome what of course the spirit of loud is here but also the spirits that were raining in the other times of the church ages cause them Lord to respect the small things not to despise the day of small things as they obey in those small things you cause the way to settle in their hearts I pray Lord that you have mercy on bless the pastor bless the whole church bless those who have given their lives to you this way may you bless each one of them and I pray also as I traveling message it was a pleasure to be here and I enjoy of I want to thank you for it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ take your seat over to the pastor [Music] you still want your [Music] [Music] pen God bless you you appreciated the service your service Christ was the [Applause] that was revealed and actually he revealed and the Revelation was he was revealing himself so when you look at all those you know seals there was always one who was always saying come and see that's the power that was preparing the remnant of that age to over the negative rer in every age so Christ is those seals that was revealed and he was releasing power to overcome everything that the enemy was releasing to fight in every age even inia he released the wealth he released Pride he released everything but you see right there again is a flying ego anointing the anointing that will help you to prophetically detect all the sles of the enemy and once you depend on him his power is present to help you overcome amen so we can be tempted tried but the power to overcome is always released so the first thing he does is to say come and see learn the tricks of the enemy he wants make you know that is there with you so Christ was those seals and everything that was being revealed in the seals was Christ revealing himself amen as they a present hope in time of trouble walking his bright so we appreciate our brother amen he does the slicing you [Music] know so we need to get back into the study of the word amen and have that eag eye you see an eag does not depend on some kind of dead car
