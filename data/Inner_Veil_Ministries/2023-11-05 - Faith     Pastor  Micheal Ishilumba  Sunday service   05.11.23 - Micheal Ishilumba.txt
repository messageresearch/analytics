in the night amen amen God bless you all it's going to be a blessed day amen amen and the Lord ordained it to be this way for the glory of his name are you happy today Amen Let us just open up and allow the Lord to speak to us amen uh brother Michael came with part of his family I don't know what what to use to introduce them you see some some of you men you just don't say this is my wife you know how to add on those additives so I may not know them so we shall ask brother Michael to come and take the platform and I thinki are The Interpreter yeah is the father and the son so it goes very well brother Li you can come and take on this uh role as interpreter God bless you brother Lei is his son but if you don't speak any English of French he's a muganda AA pure is only that a light skinned M you can come brother amen we appreciate having them around amen they've always been a friend for the years I've known them amen and I trust that the brother is going to be a blessing when you see he has you know God has given you something Lift Your Hands Say Amen your hands it doesn't kill the preacher amen amen sister Grace sister Grace is still warming up [Applause] bless God bless you all we're glad to be here this morning in God's thought I bless the Lord Jesus Christ for the opportunity he grants us this morning to stand in front of the pches of his blood I feel so small standing in your midst because you're very precious amen amen amen you know that you're so much precious more than the blood of Jesus Christ himself to have you God had to shed his own blood imagine going to a shop you need bread you take money from your pocket and you buy bread you give the money and in exchange they give you bread so what is more important is it your money or the bread had the money been more important you would have kept it but you're giving the money in return for bread because you deem it fit that the bread is more important than your money do we say Amen to that so in order to have you jesus takes his own blood he finds his blood less valuable than you are and freely he gives his blood in exchange for you so you're very valuable much more valuable than the blood of Jesus Christ and brother Brenham says thank you and brother Bram says had I had a drop of blood on a PL the literal blood of Jesus Christ I would pay so much attention to it I'd be so careful with it not to spill it because this blood was shed in order to redeem me respect I respect this Blood but then if I can pay so much attention to a drop of blood right in front of me here I'm standing right in front of the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ how much more careful will I be knowing that it took his blood to have you he says if I drop down this drop of blood I would be punished it would be a lack of respect but if I lack respect for the acquisition of the blood My Punishment would be greater so understand just how exceedingly small I feel standing in front of such a valuable can you help me and shake your neighbor's hand tell them you're valuable so I feel happy standing in front of valuable people a lot of respect for you of respect for Pastor Steven I feel much honored for about a dozen years since I've known him I've always enjoyed sitting down and hear him preach he such a good preacher from the day I got to know him I've never let him go long regardless of the distance I always love to know how he's doing this side so you're very blessed here and precious Pastor a precious Pastor in a precious a precious church and pre a precious people I feel honored James Pastor James I so happy to have come to your birthday 46 years is a long journey I feel honored preaching on your anniversary I don't know what gift to offer to you but may the Lord simply bless you richly you are wonderful [Applause] people I have known Mama Steven a lot of years now but she doesn't seem to age she's always young and if there is a good work standing here it is because she's standing strong God bless you richly [Applause] mom you know when you staring a ship all you see is the captain holding the sail so that the ship May advance in front but brother Bram says it is not the captain that makes the ship to move forward right under the ship there is that machine chamber and there are people in blue overalls in there and there those pulleys that they're pulling around so that the ship May advance but you don't see those people but they turning the motors they filled with oil those are the people that are actually making the boat to move forward amongst those people that are not seen here there are very many out there I see everyone else all that are working so that the may go ahead may the Lord God bless you I didn't come alone I came with part of my family because the others were coat up with school stuff and exams and all so I came with my wife Sir Michael sister Michael over there that sister you're seeing [Applause] there it's been 25 years that we're together she's been a friend to me and in God's work she has been so much for me so she came with me today with with his firstborn with her firstborn rather [Applause] sorry half born in English that's that's the rule [Applause] okay and my two girls and the boy there is maida you can stand [Applause] up that's my third child God bless you sistera there is the fifth who is there Benjamin Benjamin [Applause] okay CET sh and there is the very last of them you can stand up okay that little one [Applause] there they are the ones that came with me today so we feel really at home atmosphere we found a nice atmosphere nice environment at the pastor's Place Faith sister Faith sister hope interesting young little kids we had a wonderful time the Lord bless you all so I could have preached in English like the Pastor said but when I sleep I dream in French so I didn't want to start looking for words when I saw I had an interpreter by my side then I ask myself why preach in English after I'd like to be much Freer I'm not that good a preacher you have the best here I'm just going to make a little [Music] noise to appreciate this opportunity that God has granted us this morning Pastor Steven thank you for the trust a lot of years he has always trusted in me I'll not be uh I'll be brief perhaps I'm just going to narrate to you a little story you know Pastor Steven is a whole Library the old men are going away one after the other there are still others many in the world but not many of them are still standing in the message so when I find myself in the company of a man like him I feel so blessed you have no idea the joy in my heart I would have very much preferred to have sat down and hear him preach but since it was he he seemed to like it that I pray I'll make a little noise without much uh delay I pray you to stand up please we're going to open our Bibles in The Book of Mark The Gospel According to Mark we are going to read the 11th chapter Mar The Gospel According to Mark chapter 11 verse 24 therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them the Lord bless the reading of his word we're going to pray Heavenly Father we feel so small standing in front of your people we want you to get us out of the way and to take this word yourself to make it come alive in the hearts of your children we believe you do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your seats for a few minutes I'm going to speak over a little subject I'm going to speak about faith two weeks ago when I was speaking to the pastor and I promised him I was going to come I had no idea what I was going to preach to this great people but something yesterday was put in my heart while we were journeying to come here I thought I am going to just make a little noise on something that you already know very simple I'm going to speak about faith just that faith I'm going to illustrate it in a [Music] story I'll speak to you about faith by narrating a story a little story of Faith amen amen amen you know the Bible says whatever you shall ask praying believe you first that you have received it start by believing that you have received that thing then you shall see it fulfilled so I'm speaking about faith look that when God speaking about faith he's always was talking about it in the past all that you ask believe that you have received it already he does not say believe that you will receive it believe that you have already received it in the past look at the Lord Jesus Christ in front of Lazarus grave Lazarus was in the grave and Jesus got to the Grave he starts by saying father I thank thee because you have always answered my prayers Lazarus had not yet been resurrected yet but but Jesus starts by thanking godre for the resurrection of Lazarus that is Faith am amen so for Jesus it was settled amen amen amen amen so when God says something you've got to believe it have faith in What God Says even thanking him because you believe it start by saying thank you Lord because you have already done it then will you see it happen when I was thinking about faith I started to think about the great man we got in this message as I was saying they're going away one after the other and I have seen some some that have even abandoned the message I saw them preach the message and after a while abandoning it I've seen people lose their faith very recently our dear brother Billy Paul went home I believe people that were not well standing in the faith have even been shaken but I believe here you're not shaken amen amen amen amen so we have seen numerous of them abandoning the message but blessed be God he does not lack Witnesses so I am going to tell you a story in the life of my Prophet the life of your prophet in the life I don't know if he's your Prophet as much as mine how many here believe that God sent us a prophet I believe it with all my heart you're going ask me why do you speak of the Prophet the Pentecostal they speak of Paul what Paul said what they saw in the life of Paul has an effect on their lives they speak about it with joy if the Pentecostal can Rejoice of the writings of of apostle Paul how much more us the Gentiles we also have to be happy of what happened in the life of our Prophet I am not envying the time of Paul because I believe that in this age received one greater than Paul I know that Paul was a great messenger but the messenger of the last day he reached Heights that Paul could not even dream of I have no shame of him I love him so much I love speaking about the things that transpired in his life amen amen to speak the truth Frankly Speaking the the prophet of the end times he is the greatest prophet of the Bible from Enoch to this day we've not had one Prophet like to the prophet of the end time and this prophet he comes to restore Faith that's why to speak of Faith this morning I'm simply going to demonstrate it by something that happened in his life a little story and that will be my preaching for this morning a little greeting a little story I draw it from the sermon presuming 10 June 1962 10th June 1962 I'm going to take something in there then we'll make a little noise brother brandham is narrating a story in front of the church this is the story that I going to narrate make a small comment on it to speak about faith paragraph 18 this is what brother brunham says okay VOA L Comm this is how the story goes and then I know that from this story many people started organizations here and there left and right but I'm just going to narrate the small story and then here not long ago just before we start you know that my precious old mother has just gone up the [Music] road and if I had time I'd tell you how it happened how the Lord told me bypassing a hunting trip I heard sent me to another place and told me what I would get and returned back and just exactly where everything was laying perfectly perfectly I told it to the church before I ever left now I'm narrating to you the story also listen to the story now I said Grizzly I'm going to kill a 9 foot silver Tri Silver Tip Grizzly I am going to kill aib that his horns measures exactly 42 in from the base from the base up and he will be laying a little on a little panoramic never been in the country I told the church part of the church is setting here this morning when he's preaching this he was preaching it in North Carolina and there were some people of the Bram Tabernacle that was seated there while the prophet was narrating the story I told the story to the church and there are some church members seated in this building is that true church raise your hands those that are from the Bram Tabernacle so it's a vision a vision that God gave to the prophet and the prophet spoke about it in the church and in the vision he was telling them that God had told him that he was going to kill a deer and that he was going to kill a silver grizzly bear and he spoke about it in church I indicated the place EXA exactly where it was supposed to be and then some brothers escorted me to see the place he's narrating the story how he told the church how he even indicated the place and there were some brothers that went with him to this place he was in Canada we're going with you we're going to escort you brother Bram oh we went to this place where we had never been [Applause] before and just perfectly to the door where everything was everything was there the silver grizzly bear was exactly 9 ft and so [Applause] forth and he was killed in the exact spot the place where he had said it would happen the deer was laying right there he's narrating how the now let us ourselves dive into the story and keep in mind that we are talking about faith the deer was right there it was looking towards me at the base at the foot of the mountain and the tour guide said brother Bram if the horns of this Caribou are 42 in I'm going to faint that's the guide that was with him brother Bram narrated to them the story now the guide tells him if those horns are indeed 42 in I will faint I told [Applause] him well You' as well just faint because that is exactly how it's going to be am Amen brother Bram was not asking any questions on how whether it was going to indeed be 42 in or not for him it was settled because God had already sa he didn't need to measure he believed it so he tells this man brother Bram this man tells brother Bram if this this the horns like it is said in the I will faint brother Bram was still he said you might as well drop off because I it's going to be exactly 42 in am amen and when he pulled out his measuring ribbon it was exactly that 42 in I told him don't you believe hallelujah hallelujah UAH exactitude what exactitude not more more not less exactly 42 Ines am amen amen amen it was the guy brother bham says one year before this we went back there this man was only a young believer he had heard of the [Music] meetings his wife is a Pentecostal believer and he is a guide Southwick brother Southwick he said if ever anyone ever doubts this let them write and ask me let them write and ask me about he said let me tell them amen amen amen now in this hunting trip brother Ed bis was there who was narrating to this young convert how the Visions would come and he had a brother a brother who was sick who had epilepsy he would have a lot of epileptic crisis every day after having heard because faith comes from what we hear he also wanted a vision concerning his brother and brother Bram did not give him the vision brother bam told him this is not how the Visions come the Visions they come when God gives them to me I am not the one that goes looking for the vision so they were waiting and waiting one day thus sayi the Lord came brother bam told this brother he said thus sayith the Lord the next time if your brother goes into an epileptic crisis just take off his shirt throw it into the fire and say Lord the prophet Bram told us that if he has another epileps crisis do this and he will never have any seizures anymore thus sayith the Lord then he went he left sometime later the wife was there and the husband got a seizure she was alone instead of running as usual she got a hold of her courage she went towards his husband towards her husband and took the sh went to the fire said Lord Jesus brother Bram told us thus sayi the Lord if he has another seizure take the Shir from the fire it's never going to be back and the man testified he says since then from then on I have never had any more seizures amen amen amen amen now this man whose brother was healed of epilepsy was also in the hunting tripis brother Eddie bis was there oh Glory that is our little story you can read it at home Slowly by slowly I'm going to spare you all the details I'm just going to go straight to what is for the day so he had gone to the hunting trip he had brother Bram speaking about it and they were continuing then the r the deer came the let's go back to the story now I am going to go a little bit back truck a little on the testimony from paragraph 25 of the same sermon I said for the last two or three days since we've been back here you've constantly talked about if you could ever get your brother in one of the meetings he said yes brother Bram yes brother Bram he hasn't even received the holy spirit yet now he has it but back then he didn't he said yes and I told him your brother amen amen amen I describe him the things that God has done in this age he started to describe the brother he like this like he is of this height exact and he said that is exactly right that's the way he looks that's how he looks I told him well this this won't work on any other person but it will on your brother I asked him what brother I told him go and ask for your brother send for him and bring him here it's on the Alaskan Highway he lived in an old town where many Americans had died and so forth and he was an official guide and he said he said I said bu look when that boy comes and that he has a Feet Again gr his shirt and say brother Bram told me to do this in the name of the Lord and throw it in the salamander I said the Feats will leave him do you believe me he said with all my heart he sent for and got his brother brought him up that morning he went to cut Trails his little wife sweet little Christian bad's brother became [Music] violent he became rashly as well he hadn't been out of the house less he had not been out of the house more about 30 minutes somewhere there and he had one of those seizures usually the little wife would clear a window anything and getting away from him but when she seen him rolling and tumbling and that devil doing that to him she happened to remember and she believed me she come to him and straddled him that little woman on that great big wide shouldered man she straddled him jacked the shut of him walked over to that big fire tears running down her cheeks she said dear God brother Bram told us to do this and I throw this in there in the name of Jesus Christ he has never had any other seizure ever since amen amen amen amen now brother bad was a witness of how his brother had been healed now on the hunting trip brother Bram is narrating this Vision to him spoke of the vision of the deer the vision of the grizzly bear when I spoke about the Visions to him and of the things that would come while we were going downhill just as they were going downhill we shot that deer on the peak of the mountain hallelujah hallelujah the Visions don't lie he said brother Bram according to this vision we were on this we were on a kibu m You Know You Can See For Miles and Miles on end it wasn't a forest it was a plane you could see as far as the eye could reach for kilometers and kilometers and there was nothing but yellow M and bad said according to what you told me now that man that's going to have the that check sh with checks and that is when you're going to kill a 9 foot size silver Grizzly oh my they killed the deer amen now they are a waiting to shoot the bear now the man says the distance is short we can see for a very long reach we are really in that land where the vision has to be fulfilled there is only grass and we can see very far but where is the grizzly bear I can see two kilomet from here I don't see a thing hallelujah hallelujah the devil can ask you the same question this morning God promised you this where is is it I can see for kilomet I don't see anything and in fact in Your Vision there has to be a man in a square shirt where is this man look at the way you look at the way I look at the way everyone is dressed where is the little square shut brother Bram I do not understand how is the vision going to be fulfilled that picture had to First be there before you can shoot down this bear I don't see none of that since we started the trip we are soon going to finish and I don't see anything amen Amen brother Bram says I told him it is thus sayith the Lord amen amen he said brother Bram I don't doubt your word brother how could I he said but look I can I can see every little detail of this place there is nothing it's not that I'm doubting but as a human being with my eyes I have scanned the place I have not seen a thing yeah in there is no big bush there is just most everywhere now where is this bear where is it brother Bram where is the bear oh god promise me the blessing God promised me kids he promised to give me a job the devil can put you in a corner and ask you where is it look your eyes look at the look at the condition where is it where is the bear I said he is Jehovah gyro hallelujah hallelujah the Lord shall make away himself hallelujah amen he Jehovah gyro do you know the story of Abraham where did that lamb come from right there on the top of the mountain three days walk Isaac asks him the question father I see the fire I see the wood where is the sacrificial life abah Abraham Propet a prophet he looks at Isaac tells him listen my sonh the Lord shall make an animal for the sa then came the lamb hallelujah amen while Abraham was about to kill son God tells him look and behold there was a lamb a lamb somewhere there my brother your blessing is somewhere there simply keep believing and you will look you will see the Fulfillment of the word he Jehovah gyro now brother bam asks him the question again I said have you ever heard of the story of the squirrels hallelujah hallelujah have you read about it how one day I went hunting having found nothing I was going back home The Voice told me speak the word and I said let there be in this place Three Squirrels amen from nothing where there was nothing what happened with Abraham once again happened in this day where there was nothing squirrels came from nothingness not the vision of the squirrels those squirrels were literal squirrels they were bleeding visions do not bleed they were tangible squirrels you could touch three of them coming from nothing they came into to existence squirrels that had no mother and father squirrels the product of the spoken word they came into being and I I picked them up I cooked them and ate them have you heard of the story all that brother Bram was doing his time he was just bringing these people to believe they were in two different worlds brother Bram in the world of Faith the story of the message they are not simply story it is the word of God it is to bring you somewhere if only you can grasp [Music] this have you heard of the story of the squirrel that time he said oh Ed spoke to me about it and I said he is still God and if he has said that it's going to happen then it will amen amen amen amen amen he said well brother Bram if God told this to you and that this deer was setting exactly at that place well well I have never seen anything like that that bear with the description that you have given a grizzly bear that is silver that is gray for as long as I can remember hunting in this Parts I have never come across such a thing I would understand the deer but this bear you're talking about I've never seen it it's not about what you see it is about what you believe not only AR they there in this part but in Your Vision you say that this bear will be 50 yard from here how can you get get that closeth to a bear 50 yards away a bear is a very danger so I do not understand brother bham what you're talking about I told [Applause] him that exactly is what you told me and he said my brother yes he is really healed it's it's been more than a year now and back then he used to have three or four every day and ever since he has not had even one and then he added brother Bram how can I doubt it I even have proof my brother who was healed but what you're talking about here is so hard for me to believe and yet how can I doubt and he said brother Bram I have lived in these mountains all my [Music] life I have never seen a silver grizzly bear in my life I have seen ordinary grizzly bears not one that is silver in a very rare breed it is I said but there is one of that Rare Breed right here somewhere however rare it is however rare your blessing is however difficult the miracle seems to be regardless of what your eyes may show you there is some here for you if only you can [Music] believe the picture can bring you to be to lose your faith amen amen amen amen amen it can seem difficult hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory Oh Glory he says I prefer to speak [Music] more so we started going down little by little they were carrying the cor the horns of this because it was very heavy and they were going down here they were going downhill went down they kept going downhill oh oh my amen amen amen amen the man said think about it brother Brandon we are just a mile away from the end point of the place you were describing all we have left is just one mile m one mile from the place I can see now without even binoculars where the horse is up where is the bear I see every heel and you're going to kill a six a 9 foot silver Grizzly from here I said that's what he told me three months ago that's what God told me three months ago according to the word of God and the word of God has never failed I said but are you doubting this he said excuse I'm sorry brother bam I do not doubt it my heart is just so I simply do not understand this he said where is the bear ah my I told him I don't know but I know that God has put it somewhere and he told me think about it a bear that I have never [Music] seen and God has told you he is going to he said but he's the same God that spoke about my brother to you and I said absolutely said brother Bren then he said well if that's the case just put put just the the that uh the bullet put the bullet in the gun so that you can shoot right then because there is no more distance to cover we are done and I told him I will have the time to put the bullet in the gun Amen brother Bram was not shaken amen amen amen am this one wanted to run very fast because he was seeing that the time was done then just put the bullet put the bullet and shoot brother bam tells him don't worry faith faith has Mastery control of circum it is not agitated hallelujah amen perhaps you have moved for a long time without having seen the Fulfillment of the promise but this morning PR the promise one is just a mile away not very far just keep believing if God has ever answered a prayer of yours one time hasn't God ever done something for you because this brother he had a reference I know this is the very God who healed my brother he said something and it came to pass now how come it's hard I inform you this morning that God who did something for you yesterday oh he is the same today just keep believing you're not far promise from the Fulfillment of the promise let your face rise hallelujah amen amen amen amen just believe are we together my

I come to tell you there it is the picture is clear the faith is rising nothing is impossible to them that believe but there it is there it is take your binoculars now look through once again Glory [Music] Glory he took his b he said brother Bram as if I'm seeing a certain big cow what I seem to be seeing here it it looks like a cow and he said oh gly it's a grizzly bear it has to be look at it look at its far going [Applause] around in this Setting Sun it's a silver Grizzly I had never seen it before and I said what are we waiting on he said I believe if you can only shoot him from here it's two miles away or something of the kind you will have your gun is well set and now you can shoot him I told him according to the vision I was so close to it we were so tired worn out that day we had cover around 20 miles and we were going back already I got to 500 years some met away and bad said brother Bram he said have you ever shot a silver tip before they are very dangerous how come you're getting so close have you ever shot them he said I've have killed many bears but I have never killed a silver bear he said they are the most vicious of all they don't care about death he said no B does care about death so he said but the lord gave you that one didn't he I said oh yeah yes I had a little 270 I had a little 270 and so I got close and he said brother Bram don't you think you'd shoot him from here we were better off not getting too close to him I told him the vision said that we were close to him amen amen amen amen so we crossed the Little Creek we got close and then it was right there 250 yard away I could see his big yellow teeth smacking down like this he looked like a big hayto 18 in in between the ears he was Mammoth size very big with our foot as wide as this and big clothes you know he was sitting right there just sitting he was handsome to look at and and he was also mean and so what did bad do bad just made that sound and said brother Bram I will indicate to you where to shoot I said fine Brother shoot at the back shoot from the back yes sh from the back it won't be able to stand anymore I told him but the vision said I would shoot him in the heart said well then do it that way and brother bam short the first shot got him and as we came down we were holding this this bear got killed by just one shot amen amen amen amen we didn't have any ribbon to measure him with and we said this looks to be around 90 in these H I said no they are exactly 42 Ines without having measured he's saying this because he believes that God does not lie and I told Eddie I said watch the little boy the little boy is going to put his hands right there and measure and when we got down to where the park was we couldn't bring the bear we had to go back the next day you know you when they got the tape measure and they measured it was exactly exactly how it had been described in the vision just the way it had been told Brother Bram did not wait to see the Fulfillment to believe start by believing you have a difficult problem you asked something from God don't wait to see it start by confessing start by believing start by visualizing it become real and even testify amen the more you confess it it is bound to happen is the power of faith is someone with me you need something simply ask it from God while believe all that you will have as God you will see it fulfilled everything everything when God makes a promise you can stand on that promise now in the Bible what did God promise you amen amen amen amen now you can read in your Bible because when God makes a promise he holds his promise do you say Amen to that in the sermon believing in God of in the paragraph 81 24th February 1952 brother Bram says when a Divine promise is [Applause] made God is in the obligation in the obligation to fulfill F all his promises you can take your Bible you can take the message if in there you find a promise do not have any doubt whatsoever because God is in the obligation he's in the obligation of fulfilling his promise God is not any more than his word is am amen amen amen God is simply what his word is what his word declares that's what he is amen amen if this word is not effective then God is not effective but this word is God do you believe that how many believe it that the word is God in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God hallelujah hallelujah if he was God yesterday this morning he is God when you land on a promise believe that the promise and God does not fail amen amen it is God do you believe it the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and I am not any I have no more worth than my word has and you you're not any better than your word so God simply is what his word declares look at the Assurance look at the Assurance you ought to move with when I read brother Bram say something I am not going to go and verify I'm a Believer from the moment that he has said it whether I understand or not I know that God simply does not lie What God Says from his mouth is the is the truth God is going to fulfill it he told Moses Moses go to Egypt you will be my mouthpiece I will be with you as and when Moses went to Egypt God was in the obligation to be with the mouth of Moses if Moses said flies even where there were no flies the word of Moses became synonymous to the word of God because God I will be with your mouth when Moses would say frauds throughout the land even where they were not there because it's a Divine promise from nothingness the frogs would come in this end time we've got one greater than Moses we've got the great prophet of the Bible his work is to Lift Us in faith all that you read as the stories of the message they're just to make your faith rise up to lift your faith up so you can advance and in front of difficult situations you know right where you're standing you can move with assurance and say God said it God does not lie are we together the responsibility is not only God's you also have a shared responsibility in there amen [Music] amen now I'm going to end by saying this the last sermon the very last what do you think of Christ it's a question it's a subject a sermon but also a question what do you think of Christ amen amen paragraph 53 3rd March 1957 the prophet says this now if God comes and manifests himself through the logos amen amen amen in the form of the Holy Spirit and that he does the same works for this man that he did for Philip or for Nathaniel is everyone here going to believe him amen amen amen fulfilling a work is one thing now the problem comes after having seen God doing these things is everyone here is everyone here going to believe him the assembly the congregation says amen is that going to fulfill what he said according to the word he says well look this is God's part in the meeting in the meeting God has his part am amen amen what is God's part to fulfill what he promised I'm going to ask you a question has God fulfilled what he promised in this age in Mal in Luke 17 revelation and someone raise their hand and say that God fulfilled these things that's God's part to fulfill his promise this is God's part in the meeting my part the part of Pastor Steven is to preach do we say amen God has done that's his part the pastor comes does his part which is to to preach to you now your role your part is to believe that someone said everyone has their role to play God FS fulfills his word the man of God sees it his responsibility is to preach these things to you but it does not end there you the congregation on the benches there after having heard these things you also have a responsibility responsibility what is your responsibility to believe God's part is to vindicate amen amen amen God always vindicates he always plays his part hallelujah amen now the problem is not a pastor's problem I know that the pastor preaches these things to you and he tells you these things have been Vindicated they are real they are perfect but after having preached these things now you have a responsibility responsibilities as Believers your responsibility is to believe to believe what has been preached what the moment you believe everything becomes possible had it been impossible yesterday just believe amen amen amen amen faith faith brings God to the sin Faith changes circumstance it changes atmosphere in that dimension of faith everything is possible the things that God has done today if you simply hear these things and that you get no faith from them it just means you are not predestinated to have that faith the message that we have when you hear the T when you hear the pastor preaching the mission of malach is to restore faith faith has got to rise faith has to grow you've got to live in faith faith is a reality for any promise that God has made all that God has given to you as promise believe May those that do not believe stand whether they stand and say it's not fulfilled we do not believe this these things have not been given to them that do not believe these things are given to Believers let those that don't believe keep not believing but the believer will say Amen whether or not they understand what they mean whether they are in capacity to explain these things in the deeps of their heart they believe that the message is true because the message that we have received is not the human intellect it is not a man that came preaching to us the message that we have received God God borrowed a body a body in which he could enter dwell and speak to the bride to start with the message is perfect when you hear it when you read it simply open up your heart simply say amen amen amen amen amen the more you say Amen the more the word comes alive in you even in your bedroom in your office office have the word have it in your phones in your laptops have them in your phones simply dwell in that atmosphere and the word is creating creating an atmosphere of faith and in this atmosphere of faith everything becomes real faith can make you a bizar that's not understandable does someone believe this morning someone that has a difficult problem a problem that he calls impossible to solve does someone believe with everything that you have heard is there someone that believes this morning someone that feels that their faith is rising oh should should I tell you another story just to raise your faith one day a woman went in one of brother bram's meetings she had a sick child there was a strong rain that day the child got pneumonia because of the rain in the morning she went to the hospital the doctor took the child and declared the the child dead your child is dead my child dead she refused the child to be taken to
