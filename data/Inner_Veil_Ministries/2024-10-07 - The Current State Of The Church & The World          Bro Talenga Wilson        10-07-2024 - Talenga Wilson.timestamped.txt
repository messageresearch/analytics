[30:07] Christ we
[30:09] pray amen amen amen amen are you happy
[30:13] to be in the house of the
[30:16] Lord amen amen so let's get to our
[30:21] Bibles and return to the Book of Exodus
[30:28] chapter
[30:30] 12 and read from verse
[30:38] 11 amen
[30:41] amen and thus shall you eat it with your
[30:45] loins guarded your shoes on your feet
[30:49] and your stuff in your hand and you
[30:51] shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[30:54] Passover
[31:22] for I will pass through the land of
[31:24] Egypt this night and will Smite all the
[31:27] firstborn in the the land of Egypt both
[31:29] man and Beast and against all gods of
[31:31] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[31:54] Lord and the blood shall beat to you for
[31:56] a token upon the heart houses where you
[31:58] are and when I see the blood I will pass
[32:02] over you and the plague shall not be
[32:04] upon you to destroy when I SM the land
[32:07] of Egypt
[32:29] amen amen we are all familiar with this
[32:34] scripture we have all read about the
[32:38] condition that God
[32:41] said that God had
[32:45] said for Moses and the children of
[32:50] Israel when he was about resue them from
[32:53] the hand of the Egyptians
[32:58] praise the Lord let's to Matthew
[33:07] 25:6 and at midnight there was a cry
[33:10] made
[33:12] behold the bridegroom cometh go out to
[33:16] meet him
[33:30] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[33:33] their lambs and the foolish said unto
[33:35] the wi give us of your oil for our lamps
[33:38] are gone
[33:51] out and the foolish
[34:03] verse but the wise answered saying not
[34:07] so lest there be not enough for us and
[34:11] you but go ye to them that sell and buy
[34:15] for yourselves
[34:31] and while they went to buy the
[34:33] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[34:36] went in with him to the marriage and the
[34:38] door was
[34:50] shut add a blessing to his word we may
[34:53] get
[34:55] seated amen amen so now where we started
[35:00] from we started with the
[35:02] Exodus we started with Israel in
[35:06] Egypt praise the lord we have read of
[35:09] these
[35:11] scriptures about the
[35:14] Passover and we have read and heard
[35:17] about the
[35:18] scriptures talking about the the foolish
[35:21] and the
[35:23] wise now we in
[35:26] Exodus when God had given
[35:30] instructions praise the Lord he gave an
[35:32] instruction to to to
[35:35] Moses and Aon to take to the children of
[35:39] Israel and tell them of what God
[35:42] required of
[35:44] them for their redemption in that
[35:47] day praise the Lord so now God only
[35:51] required that
[35:53] condition to be
[35:56] fulfilled the rest of the things were
[35:58] left for
[35:59] him praise the Lord for the Bible says
[36:02] and thus shall you eat
[36:05] it and with your Lo
[36:09] guarded your shoes
[36:11] on on your feet and your stuff in your
[36:16] hand and you shall eat it in
[36:20] haste in
[36:25] haste it is the Lord is
[36:28] Passover now when they were going to eat
[36:30] this
[36:32] Passover God told them what how they
[36:34] were supposed to be
[36:36] dressed told them how prepared they
[36:38] needed to
[36:40] be because it was going to be a take
[36:43] off praise the Lord and it says now when
[36:47] your feet are
[36:49] guarded when you have your shoes
[36:52] on and you have your Lo
[36:55] guarded and then you have your stuff in
[36:58] your
[36:59] hands and when you shall eat it in
[37:02] haste then I will pass through the land
[37:05] of
[37:07] Egypt and what he required when the Lord
[37:10] was going to pass the land of Egypt that
[37:14] night he says I will only require one
[37:18] token that is the blood praise the Lord
[37:22] and says now when I shall pass through
[37:24] the
[37:26] land when I look at the
[37:29] token which is the blood upon the
[37:33] lint I shall pass over you but now to
[37:37] the
[37:38] household which did not have the blood
[37:42] regardless of whether they were
[37:44] Israelites praise the Lord or they were
[37:47] Egyptians if they did not have the blood
[37:49] upon the
[37:52] L they were
[37:54] doomed but whoever had the blood which
[37:57] is the token I will pass over you praise
[38:01] the Lord and now in Matthew chter 26
[38:05] where we
[38:07] read the Bible says and at
[38:10] midnight there was a
[38:14] cry in Egypt praise the Lord the voice
[38:18] that came
[38:19] down said get
[38:22] ready make sure that you are
[38:25] ready make sure that you have blood on
[38:28] the
[38:30] lint which is the token that God
[38:33] requires now here at the Midnight
[38:36] Cry there was also a
[38:40] requirement something that was
[38:43] required for the bride to
[38:45] have praise the Lord before they would
[38:48] be
[38:49] saved or before they would go in with a
[38:53] bridegroom and the says and at midnight
[38:55] there was a cry
[38:58] behold the bridegroom
[39:01] come out to meet
[39:04] him when the cry went out everyone that
[39:08] had a
[39:09] cry to check
[39:12] themselves see if they were
[39:15] ready the Lord now they check their
[39:19] LS their LS to light up their lamps to
[39:24] see if there was
[39:25] oil to light them
[39:28] up illuminate their way it could lighten
[39:32] their
[39:34] way as they going out
[39:38] to prise the Lord and now in the two
[39:41] instances we see that here it was in the
[39:46] night when the angel was going to pass
[39:49] over in the land of Egypt it was in the
[39:53] night and now here when the bridegroom
[39:56] was coming
[39:58] it was still dark praise the Lord now in
[40:02] Egypt it had be the blood it had to be
[40:06] the
[40:07] blood toen now here at the
[40:11] mid it to be the oil in the
[40:16] lamb toen praise the Lord when they
[40:20] Shake themselves there are those that
[40:23] found themselves
[40:25] wanting praise the Lord
[40:27] they found that they had not enough
[40:30] oil light up their
[40:33] L to meet the
[40:35] Bri so now they went
[40:38] inquire those that had
[40:41] o other words they had not prepared
[40:45] themselves praise the Lord they were not
[40:49] ready to receive the bride and the Bible
[40:53] says when they went to
[40:54] inquire other five wise on
[40:58] they said unto them we do not have
[41:01] enough
[41:02] oil praise the Lord why because they did
[41:05] not have the
[41:06] authority to distribute part of the O
[41:09] which they
[41:10] had and they told them you got those
[41:14] that
[41:15] sell praise the lord we bought from
[41:17] those that
[41:18] sell and now this sign here is the
[41:22] talking of the Holy
[41:24] Spirit praise the Lord the wise virgin
[41:28] they had had the message they had heard
[41:31] the word of
[41:32] God received the word of God they obeyed
[41:36] the word of
[41:37] God walked by the word
[41:40] of received the Holy Spirit which is the
[41:43] oil in their
[41:45] lamps and each time the message went
[41:48] out get ready have the shoes on your
[41:52] feet have the stuff in your hand tonight
[41:56] I
[41:57] over I pass around the of
[42:00] Egypt I SM whoever does not have the
[42:04] token praise the Lord they gathered
[42:07] themselves they held to the word Obed to
[42:11] the word collected the oil and they
[42:15] ready to meet the
[42:17] Bri the foolish ones asked to go
[42:22] out go out and buy of the
[42:24] oil but yet it was too late for
[42:29] them Lord it was very late for
[42:35] them for the time had
[42:38] come for the bridegroom to come in the
[42:42] says as they went
[42:44] out behold the badroom
[42:47] entered praise the Lord and by the time
[42:50] they came they came back the door had
[42:53] been
[42:55] shut praise the nameing
[42:57] so now when we go back to the Book of
[43:00] Exodus praise the Lord the instruction
[43:03] that we are being
[43:05] given they were given to the head of the
[43:09] house praise the Lord and now the head
[43:12] of the house who is the father had the
[43:16] responsibility over the
[43:19] household and he had to make the
[43:21] household
[43:24] ready for the Passover
[43:27] praise the Lord he had to get the
[43:29] sacrifice
[43:31] ready had to kill him apply the
[43:35] blood the rest of the
[43:38] household dependent upon the
[43:41] father but the father had receive the
[43:44] message and he had to take the
[43:47] responsibility to make the message known
[43:49] to the
[43:51] people household praise the Lord and I
[43:54] would wish to like it today
[43:57] who is the father to the
[43:59] church and what is the
[44:02] Lamb involved in the
[44:04] sacrifice literally the
[44:07] father be liken to the spiritual
[44:12] leader to the
[44:14] leader the
[44:16] messenger would be the
[44:19] pastor Lord under the anointing of the
[44:22] Holy
[44:23] Spirit receives the message he receives
[44:27] the word he receives the
[44:30] inspiration bring the inspiration to the
[44:33] people re the word from
[44:35] God bring the same to the
[44:39] peopleare them to make them ready for
[44:44] the
[44:44] Bri praise the Lord so now the father
[44:49] was
[44:50] Restless until the sacrifice was
[44:54] done the blood was sprinkled
[44:57] the
[44:59] L praise the Lord and I want to say this
[45:03] that today we have that father praise
[45:07] the Lord who God speaks
[45:10] to to prepare our
[45:12] household praise the Lord he lab day in
[45:16] day
[45:18] out to prepare the
[45:20] sacrifice to make it ready and he's not
[45:24] at
[45:25] rest until the household is
[45:29] ready he very well
[45:31] knows that the life of the entire
[45:35] family the life of the
[45:38] household and their
[45:41] success their blood is is on his
[45:45] hands he is
[45:47] restless until the entire flock is rest
[45:50] under the
[45:53] blood praise the Lord and God has put a
[45:56] burden upon
[45:59] they have received from him they receive
[46:02] from him put upon
[46:05] them praise the Lord that's why they are
[46:10] restless they spend sleepless
[46:13] night trying to search through the
[46:16] scriptures they get the
[46:18] inspiration they get out the Bible they
[46:22] start searching the
[46:23] scripes they prepare it bring that
[46:27] message to the
[46:29] peopleare them for the rapure praise the
[46:33] Lord so they wake up in the morning they
[46:37] sleep they
[46:39] preparing bring the flock Under full
[46:44] protection BL which literally is the
[46:47] fresh
[46:49] words praise the Lord this what they are
[46:53] preparing to apply to the flock so now
[46:57] the pastor is simply a
[47:01] veil and behind him the Lord the Holy
[47:06] Spirit behind him is God proclaiming his
[47:11] man to the
[47:13] people behind him is God himself trying
[47:17] to tell the
[47:19] people to get
[47:21] ready praise the Lord the father was
[47:25] simply a represent
[47:28] praise the Lord God needed a father in
[47:31] the
[47:32] house and he received the
[47:35] instruction and if he did not execute
[47:38] the
[47:39] instructions had been given of him the
[47:43] household was
[47:45] doomed praise the Lord that's why he
[47:49] became so
[47:50] restless and if he did not have enough
[47:52] receive the bread
[47:54] Grom all conditions
[47:57] all
[47:58] instances there was
[48:00] something that was
[48:03] required to make them ready we need a
[48:07] token we need the Holy Spirit to prepare
[48:10] us for the Rapture the Holy Spirit
[48:15] prepare our lives receive the
[48:18] brid praise the Living God I said behind
[48:24] this behind him is God
[48:27] and now behind
[48:30] this God revealing
[48:33] himself the church God revealing to the
[48:37] hard
[48:39] condition the hard conditions of the
[48:42] people to the pastor praise the Lord so
[48:46] now the
[48:47] pastor is already receiving from
[48:51] God setting himself
[48:54] aside praise the Lord
[48:57] receive and when he gets The
[49:00] Inspirations whether he's
[49:03] driving whether he's in the fields when
[49:06] the inspiration comes he gives it
[49:10] attention the Lord he does whatever he's
[49:13] doing so
[49:14] fast go and sit down and
[49:17] settle and prepare what
[49:22] speaking the Lord that's why many times
[49:27] people pastors are persons who are not
[49:31] sometimes very free in the
[49:36] public they have a life which is a life
[49:39] of a
[49:40] sacrifice they sacrifice their
[49:44] Pleasures the
[49:47] Lord they sacrifice their
[49:49] time set it for God speak to
[49:53] them come and feed the FL
[49:56] the Lord so when they out there they
[49:59] still listening to him and now when Hees
[50:03] from now goes down and he begins to pray
[50:08] waiting upon the Lord expound it
[50:12] more maybe the picture is not
[50:15] coming the vision is not clear so he
[50:18] sits down to search the scriptures and
[50:22] is searching the
[50:24] scriptures God is revealing
[50:27] your
[50:29] condition to him praise the Lord why
[50:33] because you have a
[50:35] need and now your need must be
[50:39] addressed God himself when he sits down
[50:44] under the of the Holy Spirit God is

[50:50] then he picks up the scripture and he

[51:21] gots the
[51:22] flock that no

[51:29] guards it so he
[51:31] sacrifices so now all the burdens of the

[51:41] TR all your
[51:44] persecutions all upon Him Praise the
