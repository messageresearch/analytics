pray and then are you happy to be the house of God so let's go to the book of l seven okay the Bible says 36 and one of the Pharisees desired him that him would eat with him a bless the reading of the word let's pray father Lord I want thank you for this opportunity that you given us to the house of God lord is such a privilege that we've come together at your word Lord may you Reveal Your word as according to the word Lord Jesus this story that is read took place many time many years ago Lord we pray that let it be manifested in our that at the end of the day there would be no way we would deny Christ so as we share your word bless it and reveal it to your people be effective in our Liv we love you Lord we appreciate you and Bless the people that have come in your service I know they have not come here in vain they have not come here without a reason they have come here because of a reason Lord and Lord you are the answer to all questions that we have whatever is in our hearts whatever requests are in our hearts you are the answer to them all that's why we've come to gather at the answers of our questions may you answer our questions may you exalt us may you comfort us and give us peace that we may live as Christians we may leave as the bride of Christ bless the reading of the word our pastors who are in the missionaries father may you comfort them may you watch over them may you strengthen them and provide whatever is necessary for them bless their families and bless the entire church back here at home as we share your word let it be a blessing to our hearts we love you Lord we appreciate you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ let's be seated praise the Lord you know I've always been timid I was told this reminded this this afternoon I was reminded was want to stand here so the truth is I'm just depending on your prayers praise the Lord and we pray let God speak to us amen amen so uh this story I know we have read a quote of it complete the verse but as we are seated the Bible says and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would with him these Pharisees this he was Desiring to make Jesus eat with him he wanted Jesus to come at his praise the Lord I'm getting a sermon here and may the Lord help us this man wanted Jesus to come and be with him in the house he sent him an invitation when he sent an invitation to Jesus Jesus the Bible says he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to and behold verse 37 and behold a woman in the city the Bible says she was a sinner praise the Lord this woman was [Music] a praise the Lord and the Bible says when she knew that Jesus was Jesus sat at me in the phes house an albaster oil praise the Lord and then and sat at his feet him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears wipe them with the Airs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it when he saw the woman anointing the feet of Jesus he saw it and the Bible says spoke within himself saying this man he were a prophet I love the things he gives you why he before he gives you the reason why he is present he first acts F now look at this scenario it was like Jesus didn't know the sins of this woman because the phus that if he was a Son of God if he was a prophet like they had spoken of him he would have known the woman he is with the nature of this woman so the thought Jes Jesus never knew the situation of this woman praise the Lord but then what happened he started saying it within his heart if he were a prophet would if he was a prophet have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth her I mean him for she is a sinner and the Bible says she was a sinner and then like you know people Miss in the misunderstand Christ they don't interpret him well praise the Lord because for him on Earth he came for the sinners he came for Sinn he came for the he came for people who were in his mind that's why Propet says God cannot lose anybody who was given in his hand Christ will never lose any person was given in his hand that was in his right hand he can't lose any of them no matter the condition they in Praise the Lord to this if he was a Believer he would know woman wasie praise the Lord so let's go on the Bible says and Jesus answering said unto him I have some to say unto them and he say and then he started there was a certain creditor had two dat no is it that read it I want to see it in the Bible in Praise the Lord there was a man who was rich he had people he was demanding and he said he owed 500 pen another and then when they had nothing to pay frankly forgave them both he's asking Simon now tell me therefore which of them which of them will love him most and then he started Simon answer and said I suppose that he to whom he gave he gave most he forgave most and he said unto them unto him thou rightly judged he turned to the woman this is what I want praise the Lord he turned to the woman said Simon words he was telling Simon that the one you s is not my own praise the Lord it was Christ presenting her to said Simon thou this woman you read it I want hear the right words of these these verses read it enter into house thou Gest me no water for my feet but she had washed my feet with tears with with the hair of her head and then he says then thou Gest me no kiss in other words you welcomed me not embed me you sh because of the way I look but this woman since the time I came in has not seed to kiss my feet my head with o thou not an but this woman has anointed my feet with oil o he says wherefore I say unto thee sins which are many are forgiven loved much whom little Is Forgiven the same little he said and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgive also and the one who forgives sin and he said unto the woman thy faith Saed the go in praise the Lord may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word now you know this scenario when we see it Jesus he was not saying neither was he supporting Sinners praise the Lord Jesus was not that he supports people who do evil praise the Lord like last Sunday the mind of Christ the mind of God is real praise the Lord anybody who is in the mind of God for salvation he real praise the Lord there's no reason that even though someone is doing evil that man can look and debate the mind of God is real when the comes upon her him and she Embraces that Grace and she uses the opportunity to welcome the grace of God the B says the faith that she has in that word praise the Lord not that Jesus is supporting Sinners but for him when he presents himself as a savior people to choose him for salvation praise the Lord Christ likes people for praise the Lord so this woman she got an opportunity in a stranger house yet she was not the one who invited the Savior praise the Lord she didn't invite Jesus after life was not worth Toc him praise the Lord as busy as Simon as bus Simon was too busy in his other you [Music] know after CL they were Vis status you know they were on the same you know like that Association reach Association and things like that praise the Lord but what happened the woman didn't invite Christ as busy as Simon praise the Lord you can never invite Christ and you think he has come by your invitation praise the Lord Christ comes because oftion praise the Lord that's why brother says Jesus didn't heal anyone until he was revealed to the father praise the Lord there were many there why that was the testimony that God wanted that place praise the Lord whenever God comes our ways not that we have written a letter to him praise the Lord you invite him for him he is obligated to come where there is need praise the Lord he always come for him it doesn't care the situation you are in as long as you invite him as long as he has come even without your invitation praise the Lord he only expects you to be very conscious prise the Lord be very praise the Lord because if he comes he never whispered to this woman be very careful when I'm in that house are the purpose why have [Music] come doesn't do like that he wants you to live by faith praise the Lord that whenever he is on ground on the scene your faith connects to him until things can change praise the Lord he doesn't want to come because the pastors invited him praise the Lord yes he may [Music] come praise the Lord other people may write invitations to Christ let me tell you the truth I wish Christ was in a certain Nation country that would be the most populated Nation the Lord I wish was somewhere bels stays here he would not rest because everybody like him in his church everybody like him in house praise the Lord praise the Lord but this is a scenario praise the Lord he has come and he wants them to get connectedto him his presence they were too busy they were moers praise the Lord people who didn't love Jesus praise the Lord maybe they wanted to bring him in that committee to show to the people that look at this prophet of people look at the king of here if he was to come here more than us he can sit in the corner there and comfort how is how is King the but they were too busy were no not they were just in there you know conversing in other things when Jesus is there they were not careful they were not conscious and there the s that was conscious it was saved praise the Lord the that was cons was taken away praise the Lord were taken away praise the Lord even us now Christ wants us when we are in his presence we should be very conscious be very sober praise the Lord would be very sober even that man who had taken that invitation to Christ not Simon Simon was a rich man maybe he had an messenger or something like that tell him Christ you invited in Simon house even that man alone he was me of Christ ever he was meant to bring the information was me to leave the presence of God forgiven praise the Lord but aftering the message what happened there's Noory of that man in the Bible praise the Lord praise the Lord people like Paul in prison praise the Lord when he was in prison and then the angel of the Lord came and opened what happened the man wanted to kill himself and he said all here praise the Lord and what happened [Music] that man was conscious that this is a man of God and when he took the conscious the of that man got saved praise the Lord because they were conscious of the presence of God us who read the Bible the Ang of the Lord came praise the Lord when he came that man was not left the same praise the Lord he was forgiven of his sins and his family praise the Lord but many times in churches people are brought right in the presence of the Lord are brought right in the presence of of the Lord and they turn away praise the Lord and they turn away but the presence of God is Among Us people turn away things praise the Lord but the presence of God it must break us down praise the Lord the presence of God has never left a man up unless not part of that presence praise the Lord all the prophets when came they were bowing down as dead this woman when the presence of God came she broke down as dead in tears because the Bible says she was no seing kissing theet of Christ meaning she was bowing down praise the Lord she was bowing down whenever there's a presence of God we must sober otherwise we as we came even more worse than we praise the Lord you may come and you're okay for the service you no you've come and you're ready for the service or you may come and you're ready for the presence of the Lord but then when is speaking will go but when the presence of God is come the truth is has never left children children of God the same praise the Lord has never them the same even us if we want to profess our healing if we want to Proclaim our healing the prophet says people are not ready for people are not ready for healing why they're not conscious of the presence of God praise the Lord people are not ready for salvation why they're not conscious of the word of God conscious of the presence of God praise the Lord so why are we in church we are here in his presence and when we are in his presence it must do an effect praise the Lord it must do an effect praise the Lord because the first thing when you are in the presence of God Lord forgive me praise the Lord first thing when the presence of God is before us Lord forgive me you to be like this man Simon praise the Lord and this man Simon what happened he missed it because the opportunity came he missed it the opportunity came and he was not conscious praise the Lord and what happened you know what happened most of us we don't know that the word of God when it is before us it is the presence of God praise the Lord most we may take the word of God usual statements praise the Lord let me tell you this Joseph one time okay this is the Prophet Joseph one time the prophet States how that God through that boy how that God through that boy you know Joseph he did he was not praise the Lord J was not warned that be careful Joseph when your brothers want to kill you I am the one behind Joseph when even you are sold in Egypt it is of Glory it is of my glory I wanted you to go there praise the Lord neither did come that the woman of she's Rising against you that you may go and become a prime minister the other side God never told him steps of his doing but he just presented his presence with him praise the Lord he presented the presence of God around Joseph when the woman came lie with me's word was I can't do such a thing before my Lord praise the Lord meaning maintained and he had recognized and he was conscious of the presence of God that's why even when evil came Joseph knew that God was around praise the Lord knew was here how that God through that boy over was foreshadowing the com of the Lord Jesus the first time and the first and the coming of the Lord Jesus the second time you know that in the life of Jose was foring the first and the second coming the prophet says and worked it all out in a life that know nothing about what was going on praise the Lord even this woman she didn't know why Jesus come praise the Lord she didn't know that God had come for her even Joseph didn't know why God wanted him to go all those pain praise the Lord then the prophet says don't that don't that just do something to you okay he says in another message the same says don't that just do something to you okay to see poor little Joseph to see little Joseph why he didn't know what was taking place why all these things should happen but it was all God working out praise the Lord it was all God working out praise the Lord this woman for Jesus to come in the phes home for God presence to be the house of of Simon allow me to say this God blinded Simon and his fellows R this one praise the Lord otherwise if Simon had Ed him the way he was to be embed this woman had nothing to clean praise the Lord if Simon taken an advantage of cleaning the feet of Jesus had nothing to clean nothing to offer to God as a service praise the lord we should be conscious of how God works in this time praise the Lord now for another announcement another announcement the where we read Luke you know this woman you know I don't have notes so you bear with me so this woman she was not aware why God Jesus had come in her life but I like the Bible says and first let's go to 43 all was going on all the girls Jesus saw them wased praise the Lord allow me to say like this Jesus might have been the first there because saw all of these washed and cleaned and when yes when the function is going on he was busy entertaining with his guests whom are washed with feet and then what happened verse and he turned the woman praise the Lord and He Turned unto the woman and said unto Simon praise the Lord thou this woman I entered into thine house prise the Lord how I love this God is testifying to you that I have come to you praise the Lord come to you I entered in your house but the problem is you didn't mind to clean me the Lord the problem another you didn't wash my feet you didn't even wipe or comb my hair comb my hair and maybe the wind had made it worse you didn't clean it maybe D was on it to wipe it away but the Bible says when he turned unto the woman he said Simon praise the Lord this is the same thing today praise the Lord Jesus has come into our houses praise the Lord Jesus has come into our houses but how much do we care about him praise the Lord Brother we are so busy Tik to to whatsapps Facebooks Facebook and I want to tell you the truth you are busy on social medias but I want to assure you social medias Jesus has come there praise the Lord you pretend and now time to sit there and read the message but your phone has the message you know the is too big how do I car people see me around with the don't the and you don't feel the weight praise the Lord if he has come entered into your house how much are we careful on him praise the Lord he has entered into our houses people say you know listen to the radi [Music] praise the Lord let me tell you this we have no excuse for the coming of the Lord he come whatever we think we are talk about talk about WhatsApp can you pretend that is not on WhatsApp praise the Lord there are so many devotions on the WhatsApp church group WhatsApp group but let me tell you this I don't know your houses praise the Lord but let me speak this okay just with experience of it may people don't listen to these messages if they listen Maybe listening while Wasing you are not careful maybe you're listening and other things are going there praise the Lord and the same way you are in that house the way you will in church praise the Lord God is talking you're looking at the time on how we are going is talking memories are memorizing F evil things talking and you thinking about the aairs of your life have supper where I get supper go back home too busy praise the Lord praise the Lord but this woman she was brought to entertain those guests she closed her business because of the presence of the Lord praise the Lord she closed her business they don't pay me money yes after not even entertained them praise the Lord the whole time she spent it with Christ yet she was HED dance and entertain but we are too busy already enter not only in the houses because go to work so he has G onon which we don't leave home praise the Lord so there's no way we can say we don't know God unless not part of him praise the Lord but people are just not conscious the are not cons God is working things out and people are not careful to notice the move of God praise the Lord the more we are not conscious that opportunity the never praise the Lord even us as I said Christ has entered into our houses praise the Lord and his even when you don't know that he's the one iise the Lord we must be conscious not to miss this such opportun the prophet says the Bible has the answers for this day and it had all for other days praise the Lord the message has the answers for this day praise the Lord without it you are out of the will of God and how are you going to serve god without his that message praise the Lord how are you going to serve God praise the Lord you know there is no way you will serve God outside of his will because we read last time the prophet said that that woman that widow woman in the days of when she El when reading the Bible the Bible says God told Elijah go and she will feed you but the prophet God s El there to feed that woman when you the Lord is our beneficiaries praise the Lord so you can't serve God outside of his will praise the Lord the prophet said s El there feed that and look at how they will come to the presence of God how first did for the presence of God than her she cared for the presence of God first than her also praise the Lord this woman she served the presence of God first before her routines the Lord and he was in the Pres presence that is Simon he was Simon was in the presence of God praise the Lord and that's what it was to him it didn't mean anything but if he had been conscious praise the Lord if Simon was conscious the truth he would have not missed the presence of the Lord praise the Lord would have not missed that presence praise the Lord praise the Lord United if Simon would rise up because he already and he reads this with you and see people not in church and see people not careful outside there and he people not minding the family altars people don't mind about the presence of the Lord when the services are open here Simon would be for us praise the Lord because he would tell you Christ is much more revealed to you it was in our time praise the Lord because in the days of Simon there was no message to tell him Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever after all the one who wrote that message he was he was not yet on Lord praise the Lord so when he sees us no Christ now when he sees us no Christ now the way we know him Simon would be for us because say an opportunity with you people praise the Lord you find young people let me have more time because you're not looking for schooles people not looking for food your time wash utensils wash clothing which I don't think you do every day which I don't think you do every day so there is a lot of time but you know it is unfortunate that the presence the houses Young people don't mind praise the lord we don't mind how will God use us when we are not careful how will God be taking us as examples without when we are not conscious with his word praise the Lord because the presence of God makes us that if they up the floor don't again wake up and you know how much do you pay for your existence praise the Lord but even when comes simp we are not conscious praise the Lord those days God came down there was fear among the people praise the Lord people were fearful to praise the Lord because one day they also wanted to talk to God and the was given to them the way was given praise the lord it's okay then wake up and when he spoke the only person who remained was Moses praise the Lord so even us now grace of God is our upon us to cover the fearfulness of God and he's always Among Us careful do we notice that praise the Lord sometimes God speaks and tells you and he frames the whole situation in one verse [Music] and he says don't be conformed to this world but in the world are not careful with God but who sustains them is good but they not careful so we who know God that he sustains us to be more careful to those people out we can show them greater is he that is in us than in you praise the Lord but now we are not conscious and that's the problem with us so he's in our houses let me tell you this there is no in your house unless radios the message books but then if you are so arant to do that then I don't know who you are by the time you don't want the Pres of you may all those things but your children have phones so you can't on the other hand says there no way you can wash him off your [Music] it Pate knew very well that this is a holy man is just he has not done anything wrong but the people shouted him to us his blood shall be upon us and our children so let meing the prophet says even pilate has nothing wash him so'se you can't CH Christ in our houses but what do we me to do then be conscious praise the Lord let us notice because every time the presence of God Has Come notice there always a blessing why would you like to bless me and not you praise the Lord let the presence of God you is andone who praise the Lord the blessings of God upon you me praise the Lord praise the Lord he's in the house and you will bring a neighbor who tune him and ENT there byce will hear him even when you don't by the time you got on radio on Friday you find Talking where will is everywhere praise the Lord praise the lord we must be conscious that's why we should live a life of the gopel any place we are in God is ready to take us from that point to take us don't think will take us in the Rapture when we in church praise the Lord because others will be in the F others will be harvesting others be B sleep praise the so there's no way you deny Christ in your houses heer what we meant to do let us be conscious praise the Lord let us be conscious and while we are conscious the truth is Christ will give us the need of his coming praise the Lord he will give it to us praise the Lord praise the Lord so the prophet says I to finish the prophet says here now it looked like I like this one I like this I've read this quot almost now this is the third time it looked like that he was sent to take away the little she had it he was sent to take what little she had but it was vice versa praise the Lord praise the Lord it looked like when God said there he went to eat the last meal of this woman there after he had drunk BR and it was dried and it dried up and he left that place praise the Lord God sends him where there is water but the prophet says it was the last meal but it looked like he was sent to take away the little she had the praise the Lord does this mean now when God came in the house of Simon he didn't come to eat his Mar praise the Lord that wasn't his intention of going praise the Lord but instead it was vice versa praise the Lord he wanted there that's why he confused them not to care for him so that the S which is conscious careful and when that is careful what purose we may think brought Christ there Canal life again praise the Lord praise the Lord and then he says the prophet when she was willing to give what she had to support the [Music] word praise the Lord when she was willing to give what she had in support of the word Prophet says who thought he was going to take the thing which he had instead praise the Lord you now the church now if you are willing to give What Spirit you do have what spirit that God give you to support of the word the prophet says then keep you alive praise the Lord then will keep you alive because what you're giving him it is his already praise the Lord you're using his to serve him praise the Lord the life it is God is the strength it is God is praise the Lord and the Heart it's God is that's why the Bible says Ser the Lord

rest of them the prophet says when the rest of them when the rest of the world was languishing just down praise the Lord when the rest of them was languishing yeah there when the rest of them of the world was anguishing and ding in and dying in hunger her and her children household all ate three good meals a day praise the Lord and then the prophet says divine revelation on the word I you see it

the prophet says lot got in trouble and the prophet says why he was out of he was out of the will of God that's lot and then the prophet says he was out of the will of God and then if you get in trouble when you if you get in trouble when the I want to see this he says yes that when you are in where did we start from if you get in trouble when you are in the will of God the prophet says God will help you out but if you are in trouble out of the will of God only one thing to do back in the will of God praise the Lord get back in the will of God has no solution for you one solution come in
