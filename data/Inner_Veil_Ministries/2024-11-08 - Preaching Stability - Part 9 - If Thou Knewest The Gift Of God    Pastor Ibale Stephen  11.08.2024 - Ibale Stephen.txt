========================================

[Music] that freeze the soul from [Music] sin oh come to this [Music] water there is a vast supp [Music] there is a [Music] reer that shall run dry and there came a voice from [Music] Heaven as the mighty rushing wind and it feel their hearts with [Music] singing and it gave them peace with him oh the prophet he gave the [Music] promise and the spirit will [Music] descend and out of your in a being flows the river with [Music] nowhere oh there is a river and it flows from De with oh [Music] there a fountain and it free the soul from sin Oh Come to this wat there the best [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Supply [Music] there is a [Music] re that's shall run dry come to this water there is a vast of oh there is a rever that never shall run Dr amen we've got a river which shall never run dry amen so you are welcome to the house of the Lord and I trust that the Lord has been good to you throughout the week amen he says I know Sister Maria he says I know I know your trials I know your tribulations he knows he knows whatever we go through but in all things we need to be thankful to God who knows us inside out you know uh one of the greatest stories brother Bram told and I've been meditating on that story for about a week is the story of Napoleon the prohibitionist amen he fought all Europe and brought it into his submission you can imagine he won all Europe at the age of 33 who is 33 here very young you know and he conquered all he had all men under his command so he started the battles as a just man amen from the age of 17 to 25 he never drunk but as he kept conquering Nations he kept losing himself there certain things that you do when you get involved in them they keep weakening your personality so at 33 he had conquered all Europe and then he cried he looked around there was no more Other Nation conquer and there are people who are like that that they fight everybody but when they come to the last man they always remember I also have to be conquered amen there was no more countries to conquer and at that time he realized that from the age of 25 got preoccupied in conquering Nations and then he lost the control of himself over alcohol and Napoleon died at the age of 33 as an alcoholist from a prohibitionist to the man conquered by alcohol and he had cried I have conquered all Europe but who will conquer me so as we live our lives it's very important to keep looking and looking deep on inside of s that father as I fight help me to fight against the things that can overcome me amen so I certainly appreciate God myself for the grace he has given me for you know continuing with the exaltations amen and I know that the exaltations as we share them morning and evening amen it is building us up amen I had a discussion with a sister for about a whole hour when I was talking about uh uh beside give so and she said if there is anything that has ever built me this is what has established my Christian life so I would encourage you along this period of time just pick up the state of a perfect man all Blasphemous names and read it for you to really be able to understand what we shall be dealing with amen did you love the special songs amen they were singing about the fountain and I thank God for that Fountain of Living Water amen God bless you brother Cal amen God will continue building your gift let's stand up and get to John chapter 4 and verse 10 Let's Just Surrender to him okay so that the Lord may speak to us this morning encourage us and establish us amen amen John 4: 10 this is the story of Jesus with that woman at the well amen and Jesus I mean uh so Jesus ask the woman for some what and she says you have nothing to draw with and you know they were flowing in two different channels Jesus was speaking from the supernatural Channel and this woman was speaking in the natural channel it's always very important when we come to fellowship with God to surrender the s that we may come on the principles of the supernatural that we give ourselves a way that the Lord himself they have preeminence and speak to us from his own language which is the language of Revelation is that amen yeah that's very very important amen coming before him through the blood of Jesus Christ not condemning ourselves because the blood has completely Sanctified you and made you perfect enough to stand before him amen so how many have come to Fellowship from under the blood without the blood you are not worthy to come into that presence so this woman here found ourself in this presence and it's just like we are in the message of the hour because in the message of the hour the prophet was hearing from God and then giving us to I mean giving it to us but then we need to be like a John who said John who says I was in the spirit of the Lord then I heard so if we are going to hear from God we need to be in the same channel because we come into Fellowship amen with a supernatural God who was spoken to us by a supernatural gift in the end time so if we take our intellect we shall certainly stumble at the Revelation so Jesus says give me water amen I mean and then she I mean she says I'm I'm I'm I'm a Samaritan and you are a Jew we have no you know attachment of whatsoever kind so we don't come to church in our kind of self it doesn't matter what tribe I am it doesn't matter what level of Education I am or what level of wealth I am come to the church as Sons and Daughters of God Amen John 410 Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that says unto thee me to drink th would thou wouldest have asked of him and he would give thee Living Water may the Lord that bless in the reading of his word amen you may be seated so for the title if thou knewest the gift of God God if thouest the gift of God this woman didn't know that gift and so Jesus was laboring to bring up to the realization of who he was so Jesus missed the woman at the well and he demanded of her and she says how is it that you a Jew ask a drink of me and I'm a woman of [Music] Samaria amen for the Jews have not dealings with the Samaritans so she was looking at Christ from the physical aspect she was looking at a Jew so when we come to church you don't look at yourself from the angle of the natural man look at yourself from the Ang of son and daughter of God but Christ replied to her and said if you knew the gift of God and and who it is that as says to you give me to drink you would have asked of him and he would have given you living water are you together with me Jesus knew that that woman needed better water than what she was drawing from the well so she did not know that the man she was talking to had the ability to give her the better water and the better water was the Living Water amen which would give eternal life and this was without money without price Jesus says you just cannot understand because silver and gold cannot afford the water that I would have given you if you knew who I was that I was I mean that was talking to you so it's important for us to come to church pray because we are going to hear from God we don't just come down here because it's a Sunday routine we need to come to church like a Jo on the island of pmos he was prayed up and then he testified I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet it was not a trumpet but it was a voice as sharp and direct as the voice of a trumpet so if we are going to live as Christians we have to be in his Spirit like John was in his Spirit John was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these Visions it had to be the spirit of God and it has to be the spirit of God with us too all others all our way fors are in vain so we come to church when we are zeroed in him amen praise the Lord so if there is anything amen that we need to do friends we need to come to church when we are prepared to be in church amen you don't just wake up come to church your mind is not in church you are going to keep looking at your watch because you got a business meeting or you got some visitors and gave them a specific time as if you had an agreement with the holy spirit that by noon the service should be over you see what I'm saying so if there is anything good that will come to us it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the result it bear so here is this woman she has come to the well like she always comes to the world like you always come to church but I want to tell you there will be one turn when that well when that church when that service there will be a greater appearing of Christ so we come to church when we are prepared for moments like that amen that day at the well there was a different woman I mean a different man but she was wondering why does a man come to the well when a man comes to the well it draws a lot of attention are you together with me yes sir was like when he went to the well it drew a lot of attention it made all those young ladies very excited because to go to the well among the Jews was the work of the women are you together with me so who is bride here this morning I believe I'm the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and we should be at the well this morning and meeting the man at the well should exactly excite us we should be able to say some amen we should be able to do some clapping if you want to why because there is a man at the well and the woman was very excited but then the man at the well says what is exciting you you knew who I was but this woman here did not know that the man who was there was himself a Fountain of Life Hallelujah there was a natural well and there was a spiritual well and the spiritual well was telling this woman draw from me because if you draw from me you will never come back for this natural water amen I would rather take that Everlasting water amen if you knew the gift of God so the fountain the Lord Jesus Christ was identifying himself as the gift of God Amen he himself was the gift of God now in in Samaria there was a day when Peter went and was actually laying hands on the people and they were receiving the gift of God the bosom of the Holy Ghost so one man came he was Simon sorer he wanted to take the gift of God by money but Peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou Hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money amen so Jesus is telling this woman that you need to break into the dimension that I'm speaking you from because if you get into that Dimension you will know who I am because I'm gift come from God that cannot be bought by money or by price but if you draw of me you will be drawing eternal life amen so this gift is Christ coming into the life of a Believer as the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen he says if you knew the gift that is standing before you amen so John chapter 7 and verse 37 are you still here this morning amen okay verse 37 here he says in that last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying man let him come unto me and drink he is giving free water because it's a free gift a woman at the well if you knew the gift of God who was standing before you so he that believeth on me as the scripture says out of his belly shall flow rivers of living that's what Jesus amen was inviting this woman to that receive me on the inside of you and out of you I will be flowing as a living water amen praise the Lord when we come down here amen out of our belly rivers of living water and where that ring water flows it flows with a gift if you knew the gift of God he fls with the gift amen Apostles some prophets to some teachers to some Administration to some prayer warriors to some musicians to some with GI of healing some gifts of wisdom so when we come together then flows the rivers of Living Water amen you may be the one who is having that flow hallelujah hallelujah praise God Jesus says you just don't know only you knew the gift of him that is standing before you Hallelujah Hallelujah and verse 39 but this spake of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so the Holy Ghost listen to me now is the gift of God that was standing before that woman by the person of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you see he was right there and he says I am the gift of God but you have look at me through the ve you can get to see the rivers of Living Water bringing himself down condescending comaling down to be made King f with the sinner amen think of it people how can you reject that matless love amen he's offering you live I mean rivers of Living Water the woman did not know that Jesus was God's wrapped gift in a human body and he said you've heard how I said unto you I go away and come again after you I go away I take away the body for and then send back the rivers of Living Water I go away in the bodly form I come back as the gift of God to you so the gift of God is the life of the person the Lord Jesus Christ and God gives us this gift as the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen how does this gift come it comes through Acts chapter 238 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call the principle is constant amen nothing changes repent be baptized receive the gift are you together with me that's the way we can receive the gift praise God repent which means to change your mind positively causing the change of your ways of life amen so when you repent from the sinful ways that control your life then be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so baptism means to submerge in water but Paul identifies it with barrial as one comes out of the water it points to resurrected life hallelujah hallu praise God no you not that so many of us as we baptized into Jesus Christ we baptized into his death oh Hallelujah Jesus tells this woman if you know the gift and who it is not speaking to you amen so our title this month amen preaching stability part n if thouest who Saturday amen these are the stabilities that we want to build the church because if you know the foundation then you know that you have the ability to catch light amen repent be baptized and this baptism here amen is a barrier with Christ and as Christ rose with the newness of life amen then we also after the bapm should resol with the newness of life amen amen Romans chapter 6 verse 4 he says therefore we areed with him by baptism into death we are trying to understand the constant principle repent bapti receive the gift and I believe that all of us here have repented have got a desire to live a clean life to live like a Christ you have put up a battle amen and you have got the blood constantly washing you amen and then after that you die to the things you've repented of how do you die to those things by you accepting to say Lord Jesus I know baptism does not save me amen I can as well go into the water as a dry Sinner and come out as a wet cner but at this time Heavenly my desire which is on the inside that I have to die to see I'm going to show it by me going into water and as I come out of water let it be a sign that I'm going to walk different amen so you know let's go back to Romans 64 therefore you are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of Life hallelujah hallelujah he was raised from the dead by the glory of the father and he was not the same anymore hallelujah hallelujah the Pharisees could not lay hand on him anymore he was different he was a newness of Life amenu yeah now I want you to understand baptism in a deeper definition than going into water because the act of going into water mentioning the right formula that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is not exactly the baptism the baptism should be a decision from the inner man that I'm dying to see Hallelujah I'm going to bury my SE so when the inner man has accepted to go and bu the SE when he's coming out is actually not Desiring to walk by that sin anymore is that amen for everybody you don't desire to walk in that it doesn't mean you cannot be tempted it cannot mean that you cannot fall you can fall but you cannot completely amen remain in the for you rise because that's not your nature of life God called you to live different amen so one must go in water as one that's being M into the nature of Christ and that's how we receive the Holy Ghost we baptize you in the name and the name speaks of the nature we baptize you in water to the nature of Christ hallelujah hallelujah that's how you receive the Holy Ghost because we are being baptized into our nature amen and the principle is constant so the B of the Holy Ghost releases the life of releases his nature releases his character to the church he releases himself as a life as a living water as a talent amen as a ministry as a seal as a guide so the B of the Holy goost is not a dead anointing it's not a dead anointing amen it's an active life oh praise God Amen let's go to Matthew chapter 25 and verse 14 do you love him church I love him too amen 25 verse4 for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into the far country now listen the Kingdom of Heaven is not a man traveling to a country but is as a man traveling into a far country he calls his own servants and commits to them his Goods not their goods now it is his Goods he says come on now come and become custodians and one he gives five talents to another two to another three to another one to every man according to his several ability and straight away took his journey are you together with me he gives thing his talent okay he opens up a certain measure of the river of Living [Music] Water and in there God flows into your life with the talent amen that's how God does not their goods but his Goods this speaks of you being a steward Hallelujah and when you are a steward when you begin to administer amen the gift given unto you then you are flowing a measure of Living Water to the church are you together with me yes the baptism by you know the gift of God the baptism by the gift of God produces different abilities and the way we tend to these abilities is what we call the stewardship amen we must learn that in the kingdom of God we are just stewards amen he gave them his own you gifts amen now Paul defines this stewardship in First Corinthians chapter 4 and verse one he says let show let a man show account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the Min of the mysteries of God think of us on this order that we are ministers and the ministers are stewards of the mysteries of God moreover it's required in stewards that a man be found faithful it requires faithfulness because you are an [Music] administrator not a appropriator amen you are just an administrator amen when he was going into a country he says keep and use this until I come are you together with me all of us whatever gift we have it take this and use it until I come whether you are a prophet take this use it until I come whether you are a pastor take this use it until I come whether you are a musician take this use it until I come we are not propri amen we cannot use the gift of God as proor our submission to him while using the gift is faithful stewardship amen that is faithful stewardship so to every man according to his ability every maned meure amen amen every man brother Steven you''ve got a measure and a big one look at your Bible praise the Lord amen the Lord has given us measures we drink of the Same Spirit but then manifest sever according to different measures of the same gift which is Christ amen listen to brother Bram here he says and how that brother Cobo sitting there told me he was just converted from a night club he and his wife and now that singing how do you try to impersonate that it is a gift comes from God now the gift was in him when he was born amen the gift was in the other man when he was born but what they use it for is what goes amen that's where we have to answer how we use the gifts that God has given us brother and his wife were in the night club they were gifted all these men here who sing with voices up and down they were gifted Lucifer himself was gifted so every man will have to answer for his talent God gives men talent and they have to use it some can preach like a house on fire but God requires these talents and I'm so thankful to know that this Brethren sitting back there yielded their talents which they could be out there night class using those talents but they surrendered them to the Lord Jesus Christ to win souls amen so when you are created you've got a talent all the those disciples had talents but what happens now on the day amen of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came and anointed and the talent so that the talent could win Soul you have a natural Talent and if you are a seed of God that Talent was purposed Amen to win s for Christ amen so every born individual is talented and will give account for the talent how he used it I'll explain this let's go to Exodus 31 he says see I have called by name bz the son of Y the son of of the tribe of Judah I have called by name meaning that I have designated him a specific design in form of abilities and character that's the name and he called him Abraham to mean father of Nations that's the character that's in the name are you together with me so he's saying I I specifically designed bz and I placed a gift in him and verse three I have filled him with the spirit of God hallelujah hallelujah if you knew the gift of him that speakto you I would have given you living water and in the Living Water there is a talent in the Living Water there is a gift so the anointing the B of the Holy Ghost is not an idol anointing when you receive the Holy Ghost it anoints the gift in you to begin to minister according to your calling I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom so to you the spirit of God in works you see there is something in there and when you receive the holy ghost that seed is quickened to begin ministering to God in a designated way in the way God has called you to Ser are you together with me that's why sometimes listen to me I wonder that do people take time to listen to the message do people take time so I decided to say I'm going to walk through with the people just to borrow 15 minutes of the morning and 15 minutes of the evening isn't that good friends yeah to ignite what God has placed on the C amen so I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workers that's why you young men you go to school but you must pray where is my name where's my gift sometimes you say the doctors get more money but your nature you are a mechanic you don't have sympathy with people you are going to deal with patients like you are dealing with metals because we are looking for where there is money and yet God has given you another fi and at the end of the day you can't have patience with people in pain and sister Susan can testify to this that the medical coun has disced him because he doesn't have that gift that's not where his name [Music] is God could have called you to do manual things maybe like B but you want some kind of a special office job and then you start saying this job is too D for me too D for me you see what I mean while you have got the ability naturally to study and go into every area if you are a son of God ask God where is my gift you see I have filled him with the gift of God and when this gift is put at work it brings to surface the nature and talent that's Endor in that person amen verse four for it was to Divine Works to work in go and silver and brass and in cutting of stone to set them and in carving of Timber work in all man of work you have something in you much as you may not be a ppit preacher much as you are not a ppit gift there is something on the inside of you that the Holy Spirit wants to annoy and why you receive the B of the Holy Ghost and he anoints that part that part makes you acceptable in the body because God himself will have a way for the gift and then you'll see what among the people and then you are doing things together with the people and there will be a happiness when you realize that you are a part of a church some people walk away from a local church not because the church is bad but they have failed to find their position if you knew who it was that is speaking to amen so again brother Bram says not many years ago you may have the gift but brother you need your time Amen to begin working into that gift Moses had a gift but he needed 40 years to work himself into that gift are you together with me there are some people he gets a dream that I was preaching and tomorrow he wants to preach me and it's true it does but every gift has its position amen there are men who have started out here but they are not here anymore and they're using the gift and they still look back here because they've got something in them but then every gift finds his appropriate [Music] Place praise the Lord yeah not many years ago there was a man that believed he he had a talent to write comic [Music] strips amen he went the editor of a great paper in ar City and took some of his writings and the editor said sir you just haven't got it you there is need of you of trying there's no need of you trying you can't do it but that didn't satisfy him he knew he had it and he went back again and again trying but the edor would turn him down finally went to the other places and they turned him down saying Mister you just haven't got it you can't do it but yet he believed he got it and that's the way he's got something in his hand and that's the way he's got something in his finally got the job writing little scripts I believe for the editorial of for a church some sort of a little comic stream for the church and he rented himself a little rat M invested garage where the mice was running all over the place in his sheet and he got notice a pecularity of a certain little rat there is where the story of Mike house was born now it's a mount million Disneyland show he had something in his hand and he knew he had it he knew he could do it and that's the way every great achievement is made when men and women have something in their heart they know they can do it hallelujah hallelujah he went and brought and took this things to a man and the man says this is garbage he wrote again another one took it back to him he threw it in the D my friend you don't have the gift you can't do it and then he went to the church okay write something for our little kid and while he was out there doing the work of writing scripts for the church he couldn't afford a decent place there were RS all over the place and the inspiration and the gifted studed a certain R and he had ability to write something about that rat it is a gift and when he wrote it it became great and that's how we got the M uh uh house the Mi Mouse thing in the Disneyland in Florida out there that's the biggest thing that the people go amen everybody in the world who tells he has been to Disneyland you know that man has [Music] money but you look at where it started from don't despise a little beginning when God has begun with you just give it time and see where God will take amen amen so gifts and callings are without repentance then those gifts come these are in you before birth and when you are born again they are anointed to be used in the building of the kingdom of God Amen gifts is God anointing your talent so that your talent could be used in the body of Christ that's a gift you understand that now so Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 7 I thank God this morning amen but unto every one of us [Music] is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ amen everybody has been given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ how much depth of spirit have you received and that determines the weight of gift that will be activated in that man's life amen when it comes to Ephesians 3:7 here whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power so the gift of the grace of God is the spirit you receive if thou knowest the gift of God and who it is that says unto thee give me to train and I would give you living water and the content there is how God will thereafter use you you see if you don't find peace in the church then know who that man is that is telling you give me to drink when he gives you living water there and then you settle you find your position and you'll be happy being a son of God daughter of God among many brothers you are not going to be offended beyond measure if that comes even that one has a purpose amen yeah how could have David become king without Soul he needed soul to shape his character to become a king you see what I mean so it doesn't matter what happens even that is necessary for shaping your character in your gift amen so verse seven if we can go back to whereever he was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the working of his power unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given what Grace was that to preach among the Gentiles the unable Riches of Christ amen so the gift is given by Gra and places every individual in his position in Christ Paul could have gone to the Jews but he says no this gift here DS me Amen to the Gentile in the formative years when I was already established here I had friends who were telling me we we can help you to start some substantive work but I felt my calling was here I couldn't go anywhere I had the opportunity but I felt deep down in my heart that my position was you see Paul could have gone to the Jews but he says the grace I receive is to preach among the gentil god once he anoints a gift he gives it is appropriate place do you love him the gift is given by grace amen and it helps a person to be a mean to find his position in Christ and that gift is Christ building back the kingdom amen so in this manner God gives himself as the gift of God to reestablish the kingdom that had fallen by sin I will repeat that God gives himself as a gift to the people so that the gift which is Christ in the people could reestablish the kingdom that fell by S amen that's the Revelation he was trying to give the woman at the well he was telling her I am the gift of God I am the wisdom of God I am the life of God I give myself to you as the BM of the Holy Ghost without money without price if you knew the gift we are getting a little into the depth of it now let's go to Matthew chapter 22 I took you through the end of the Covenant and I took the Lord said unto my Lord amen so that you may really be able to understand the way God works with us build out of us a kingom Matthew 22:41 while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them and you know Jesus was good he knew they believe scripture so you would tie them in the scripture if we say this they will say that if we say this they say that they keep quiet when they keep quiet then it teaches isn't that wonderful Jesus asked them say what think ye of Christ who son is he they say unto him the son of David you are coming he says unto them how then does David in spirit call him Lord amen saying the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemy is thy foot to if David then call him Lord how is son amen and no man was able to answer does any man from that day ask him questions ah uhhuh they says uhh uhh uh this man can tell you in the scriptures so we are trying to understand if you knew who the man that speak of you if you knew the gift of God so now David I mean Christ asks them who was Christ speaking of who who is Christ know he takes them into you know who is the son of David then says then how can he be son when he Lord he tied them amen so you know how then does David in the spirit call him Lord because they said Christ would be a son of David says okay Christ would be a son of David but why would David in the spirit call him Lord the Lord say down to my Lord sit down at my right hand till I make all your enemies your foottoo so son of David must be a figure of speech defining Christ service in bringing the kingdom of his father into physical existence so if you know I want you I don't know how I can say this David I mean son of David is an office amen it Christ was going to step into to make possible the restoration of the kingdom is God and David looked and saw the Lord the Glorious logos take on the B of Flesh to become the gift of God that defeats the enemy amen he stood out in the spirit and he saw the Lord taking on body are you together with me so a clear observation by David is that why God took another office he would still return the same Glory he would still retain the same power so David was looking at two distinctive offices and two distinctive manifestations but not two personalities okay so the sun came down as the visible expression of the father all that the father was was poured into the Sun so that's why he says if you knew that you are standing before God if you knew that you are standing in front of your creator if you knew that you are standing before a man who can change you but the woman was looking at a veil let's take the words of David himself Psalms 110 verse one a of the [Music] the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make th enemies thy foood to so here David Sees God condescending and taking on a Redemptive nature in the form of men but yet still the almighty God Amen verse two the Lord said I the Lord shall send the road of thy strength out of Zion rule thou in the midst of th enemies verse thy people shall be willing in the day your power of th power and in the beauties of Holiness from the womb of the morning thou Hast the due of the youth the Lord has and will not repent thou art a priest forever over the of the Lord at thy right hand shall strike the I mean through kings in the day of his Wrath so God in the Jesus body he is seen as the angel of the Covenant M becoming his own servant in a borrowed body of the man Jesus so M had come down into body the woman was blind those great facts but she was turning first to First amen with the prophecy of David and that's the gift of God Amen so now in this body he fulfills Hebrews 73 saying without father without mother without desent having neither beginning of days no end of life hallelujah hallelujah that amen hallelujah hallelujah made like the Son of God he says actually he is that one that is without father without mother without desent having no beginning of days having the end of life amen he was only man like the Son of God he was only man in the body of Flesh to abide as a priest Contin amen so brother Bram says who was it readers Bible scholars what was it lead the children out of Egypt it was the Ang of the Covenant who is the Ang of the Covenant Jesus Christ who was a pill of fire this is what the woman didn't know he was saying if you knew he stood here on Earth and he said I come from God I go back to God he came here was manifested in flesh he went back to the light again but the end of the Covenant that makes all things this woman had struggled with her life one H one man a second man a third man six month until he met the seven Hallelujah the seven had to deal with the inner person in order to redeem the outer woman are you together with me he says if only you knew and when she broke into that re and who knew it was she was given Waters of living I mean she was given living waterers hallelujah hallelujah she was given water on the inside she C the revelation of who this Messiah is and brother it changed her life amen oh hallelujah hallelujah she washed off all the she took that kind of L which was supposed to be used to car the water she wrapped around her [Music] Min she could not walk that way she broke into Revelation and the Revelation took control her she went into the City and the city knew her very well and they started to wonder what has happened with the eyelid pencil is not there the lipstick is not there the short dress is not there is she the one is she the one and then she would say yes but I've got a revelation I stood in front of the gift of God are we standing before the gift are we allowing the gift to do is work in our lives if you knew the gift of God that stands before you a very Sunday morning if you knew the gift of God that stands before you every Wednesday night if you knew the gift of God but when you break into the revelation of that gift it makes you a new P that's my desire this morning is God the woman didn't know that this is the end of the coven who comes down to make things possible she did not know that she was standing before the one who had no father and but only given a body through the birth of a woman to come and testify she did not know that she was turning before Giver of Life the Ang of the Lord amen is always the one we come here to have fellowship with you if you knew the gift if you need the gift it changes things amen the Ang of the Lord is the guide and the purpose each time that Angel of the Lord came down who was to help Israel to get into the prop and to remain in the prop you see so to Israel on the journey he manifested as a pill of fire and he L Israel from the outside into their inheritance he was a pill of Fire them and the CL by day over them of the Lord and he was telling go forward go forward go forward but after the sacrifice of C this same Angel of the Lord the angel of the Covenant came down as the Holy Ghost to guide you into the promise Amen to the bride he doesn't guide from the outside to the bride he guides from the inside are you together with me if you knew the gift and this gift is God himself standing before the woman but the woman was in another Di Wasing of standing before you friends this gift here is not only to stop us from drugs alcohol night life and everything it is a life amen here we have King David and then the Lord who told his son to retain Divine Authority hallelujah hallelujah David was looking at it amen when the father was giving the son the authority and he says retain this Authority until you bring all the enemies as your foot Hallelujah and then the son came to stand before the woman and this woman is the type of you amen your filth your evil your life and everything and then instead of receiving him you Contin a debate and you are a Jew and I'm a Samaritan and you are this and you Pastor am this recognize the gift of God Amen recognize the gift of God that was in the Jesus body but now out power into the body of the church amen if you can know the gift of God are you together with me if you can recognize the gift of it's not knowledge that gives these things if you can only know the gift of God if it's knowledge everybody would do it but if you can know the gift of God that's what matters you don't before a man you don't stand before a Jew you stand before the gift of God and see what God would do amen praise the Lord God Pur to establish a Divine Kingdom amen and stretched forth the hand of Jesus Amen the son of David amen listen here questions and answers God unfolding himself down to human being Now watch how did it do how he did it now that's the Son of God the logos now I can see him playing around like a child before the father's door with all eternity and now then in his imagin he begin to think of what things should be and I can hear him say let there be life hallelujah hallelujah when did he create he created when he condescended from Elohim and he came down into the logos and the logos was the sunship was God taking a spirit body and in that Spirit body he creates all things and all things he creat were created by Him and for [Music] him he's not creating for another higher God because that God just [Music] took and he stepped into that body and he says this is the son amen so Colossians 1116 him were all things created all things were created by Him and for him so he condescended before he could create and it SE this same concept of the condesending God that he takes another step to create himself a body of Flesh for the of s and in that body he steps out before this woman if you knew the gift if you knew the gift and the woman doesn't know that she's so honored that the same one who created the heavens and earth who came down in the body of Jesus is standing before he had the power to dissolve that woman he had the power to force her to change God doesn't work like that if you knew he wants you to come to a point of knowing and submitting will you come to that level he's God he can do something that you can never be what you've never been you've always been amen but no he wants your participation you so the man was standing right there and God LA from this angle to that angle talking about the man and everything until breaks through and you said brother Steven why do you preach for two hours God is liing some somewhere here somewhere there somewhere there somehow he breaks through b and gets to the point he says I perceive you are that prophet will God break towards us [Music] today if you knew the gift it will change your life when the woman knew the gift it changed her life amen notice God has had three fold purpose in this great mystery secret amen that yet before the world the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people to reveal himself in Christ therefore he blessed his name in Christ and Christ became the express image of Jehovah with the purpose of bringing everything under his control so the second purpose was to have preeminence in his book of believer that is the bride and he might live in the people so revealed to the woman then stepping down into the woman that the Life of Christ may take over the life of the Bride are you together with me all that Christ was he pours into the church and today the church is the anointed Christ here on Earth brother Bram then says when I think of it that the church is the anointed Christ here on Earth when I think of it I just denominations pass off the sin and everything else just going when I see God's gra purpose revealing himself the fullness of the god and body and then to bring the fullness of the godhead bod into people that you could have the pinenes the oversight the leading there he is working back amen his glory to man Hallelujah huj that's why he was Liber that woman of John 4 represents you Hallelujah to the point where you recognize who you are before God I would give you living water and out of you shall flow rivers of Living Water and I've told you as the waters flow it doesn't flow empty water that Waters anoints your talent anoints the gift that God has placed on the side of you so flowing out of you is God beginning to use you as the anointed Christ that's why we should not avoid the assembling of ourselves together you come and shake the hand of the brother and it tells you go bless you if he has got that right Spirit on there you have taken a blessing amen they lay hands on the sick and they shall recover even doesn't know that you are sick but in there the gift of healing he say God bless you you are going to be well he hasn't prayed for you hands amen and you receive that's why we should be a CH and flock together because everybody has got a talent to build the kingdom of God Amen see that's the threefold mystery he comes to reveal himself to the woman and then steps into the life of that woman is Living Water the B of the Holy amen and he says and thirdly to rest the kingdom twist right position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the even with these people talked with them fellowship with them so the assignment of the son is to bring all the enemies under his feet and then establish the Kingdom of Heaven amen so the Bible teaches about two kingdoms the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of God is the present time where you are where out of you flows the rivers of Living Water amen Luke chapter 17 20 to 21 the kingdom of God the Holy Ghost ghost in you the Living Water amen so the B of the holy ghost in a Believer is the kingdom of God but as the kingdom of God grows in the church body amen it builds itself into the kingdom of heaven and when the last elected one has come to that Perfection then the kingdom of God becomes the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus comes and takes his church home amen there is an important Point here the Holy Ghost drops into your life on the principle of a growing Master seed and it grows in the life of a Believer amen crowding all the canal out so when that comes it is not a flood no it's a mastered seat something comes true and then drops at the center of your life and it begins to grow so that's what he was asking to that woman why can't you break into the revelation of who is talking to his gift of God coming to you he want sucess so brother Bram says when a man is saved that much of him is God that much of him is God that's the little light that comes in to make you quit doing what's wrong that little button like a light and power of God will keep growing growing growing cring out unel so when The Parables of the two kingdoms as spoken in the Bible they have one common element it's growth because it's the same life amen if you knew oh there was a mystery standing in front of that but today there is a revelation standing before you take it amen it's not a mystery anymore it's a revelation that stands before you Christ is the Myster of God revealed amen it's no longer a mystery it's revealed to you you either take it or reject it amen so Mark 4:26 let us look at the element of the Kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of God they've got a common element in them it's growth when the B of the Holy Ghost drops in the life of one individual it keeps growing growing growing it's the same way that you know all of us together we are having the growth of the Holy Ghost to bring forth a kingdom amen so Mark [Music] 4:26 and he says so the kingdom of God as if a man should cast a seed into the ground so the kingdom of God grow you cast a seed on the ground because you want this SE to mature and so once it matures it grows into the Kingdom of Heaven 13:31 another Parable put forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sold in his field meaning a true I mean true birth it grows now in Daniel chapter 2 verse 31 through 35 we see a progressive growth of the kingdoms of this world as depicted by image of Nebuchadnezzar are you together with me it was growing amen so and Babylon the head of God was the peak amen of that Kingdom but then we see a stone which was cut without hands and Christ is the stone that was cast without cut without amen that will finally build himself into great Kingdom so God has purpose to have the Kingdom on the prin of Jehovah God who dwells with his family amen so he determined to have a kingdom and I want you to look at that woman at looking at the bride amen the first husband the second husband the sixth husband but the seventh changes the situation are you together with me he changes the situation he says do you know who I am amen when she broke forth that was enough she had found somebody amen who was going to be so meaningful to her amen he isn't now he says he is in self-existence anymore exist with his family Elohim now is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who ex his family so now the kingdom of God will change from an individual family from the kingdom of God to the kingdom of heaven are you together with me which is going to be a whole group of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ not governed from outside not governed from away you know he's going to come down and take his PR live with her praise God there was a desire of God to be prominent and fellowship so it was coming Progressive LEL he has purposed to work his bride back into the area before the fall where God would come and say hi and they say they are not going to know him by Vision no sir we are not going to hear him by a voice no sir it will be Fellowship we shall be together are you together with me it's going to be totally different so Jesus to make this woman who he was if you knew I today if you knew who the gift of God is amen the Lord Jesus Christ always knocking at your door always seeking for Fellowship the one who is growing into your life if you know him it will change everything in our lives I wish I had the language to express what I feel amen praise the Lord do you love him amen hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus came down and worked all day and after his work was done his time to go had come he came and spake unto them and he said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth he was empowered to bring all the enemies down Hallelujah the Lord said unto my Lord yes sir sit at my right hand take my authority take my power until you bring all the enemies to if the woman in knew who it was my my but Jesus finally says all power in heaven and us is given unto me why to bring down all forces all powers all Wicked Spirits under the feet of Jesus Christ all man of evil and all man of unil was given to him amen oh man sit at my right hand take control be in control Ru the heavens and the Earth you've got the authority to bring down when you say go they go when you say come they come when you say blessed they'll be blessed when you say set free they'll be set free when you whatever he says he has got the authority and Jesus La if you knew who it is I know the condition you have it may be different from that who it may not be six husbands but it's a different thing that today Jesus stands before you and he says if you know the gift of God that stands before you given Authority and power to break every Power to break every CH to break every addiction that's my prayer God break every addiction let your people go amen praise the Lord yes sir and after he has broken every Power after he has broken every addiction every El has received the Bas of the host and the elect has defeated all the weaknesses and the last elected one is brought in and walks into the statue of the perfect man comes under the control of that glory and power Hallelujah then he going to come down the woman will say yes he's the one I met at the world hallelujah hallelujah I don't know what you are going to say I don't know where he's meeting you today but you are going to select that woman is the one I met at the world is the one I met when I was buing I was one when I met when I was in the P the one I met when I was in witch you have a testimony that somay you stood before the man and once you CAU a revelation of the gift of God your life began to change a little light dropped in there and then it started crowding out all brother you have gone a journey so far and one of these days brother you are going to see that your atoms change into the very atoms of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall see as he is God bless you God bless you if you knew and today you know how many of you know out of you shall flow rivers of Amen let's Stand Up Give the Lord a hand of Praise tell him Lord now I know amen amen now I know the gift of God God has has been coming in different phases coming to us he will not force you but he'll keep using this ministry using that Ministry using this approach to the word another approach to the word until you find out and then you say yes and once we say yes the mastered seed drops On th side and that makes a difference the rivers of Living Water will flow God bless you brother do you love him amen that man from G he has done so so very much for [Music] me forgiv all my sin bless the Holy Ghost with oh I love that man from [Music] I know it's really so our was born to save men from their sin John saw him on the
