your salvation where there is there is [Music] [Music] [Music] where there is pressure [Music] [Music] I've been found [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is [Music] there is foreign [Music] Genesis chapter 2. verse 21 the Bible says and the Lord God caused deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof foreign which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the mind and Adam said this is now born of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man Adam they official a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh almost yet may God blessing of his wife praise the name of our Lord sorry that we didn't end the meeting early enough of lunch break foreign The man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and then they shall be one flesh so now how do we become one you know marriage brings us into the union and then when we are married we need to maintain that Union in our marriage you know like I just like that scripture in the Malachi chapter 2. because unless maybe people have been forced to marry one another of course we see that in some cultures and some religions and even in some Churches you find that you know they say you go with this one or this one take you things like that is but then here is that when you are coming into marriage you find that even the covenants which you really pronounce or which you are sent to over you know you know they ask you do you have any impediments do you have any issue that why you should not be married you know so they give opportunity to the man and even to the woman so that if you are saying I'm not interested then you opt out so now but the Union or before but then you see the union of marriage people should get into it willingly and then you see how the Lord started it that God didn't take it from another body but God took him from Adam's Body And now when he took Eve from Adam's Body he's very rape then he brought the woman to the man I was very excited to be United with his wife and that is also the same thing when people married they are so much excited praise the name of Allah so much excited to move out until they live and close the programs of all other things so much excited to live together you know because there is a union that God has brought this and this is the same thing that God wants us to maintain in our marriage that Union that you had on the wedding day that love and feeling for one another you had on the wedding to maintain the same praise the name of it maybe on the wedding day maybe you could have had some doubts But as time goes on there is a trust you need to build for one another praise the name of Allah so God expects us and everything that we do praise the name of Allah as a husband and a wife we need to see that we make our marriage as being one in that marriage and the only way we can have our marriage workers if we need to have the mind of God you need to have the mind of God what is the mind of God concerning our marriage what is the purpose us of God concerning our years so now in the message the uncertain sound God is a holy God and when man is born of the Holy Spirit he's a candidate he's not only that but is a king he's a prince he's from another Nation his kingdom is above he's filled with God's power God is presence the woman does that puts on clothes the man lives and true to his wife the wife lives they want nothing of the world their affections are set on the things above they are finished with the things of the world they are new creatures in Christina not them or not them holy but the Holy Spirit govern them they don't have their own mind the holy spirit moves in there that's the reason they act crazy to the people of the world because they have moved by a spirit of another kingdom so when the spirit of God comes down in us it will change our mind walk upon our mind and you see it is very very important that you have God in you first then you get into marriage you know you need to get the spirit first woman get into the marriage praise the name of us and so even now in our marriages we need the spirit of God to rule in our Affairs we need the spirit you know to take cover for God praise the name of us the scripture says the head of the man is Christ but if the man doesn't have Christ then where is his head is foreign then you don't know what is going to happen in your home but you see in marriage the man has to have the head which is Christ if the man is without the head um so he will do whatever he wants to do praise the name of God and then the head of the woman is the man which is but now imagine a woman getting a man who is headless trouble visible but now we ourselors everything for being if we as husbands we have the head cries then you should be able to manage your Affairs at home you should be able to be patient with your wife you should be evil you know you you are you are able to know what exactly to do at that time now let us go to First Corinthians chapter 8. and then verse 9. becomes a stumbling block to them that are weak area for If any man see thee which has knowledge sit at meat on the idols Temple shall not be conscious of him which is weak be emblooded to eat those things which are offered to idols and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom Christ died but when you've seen so against the brethren and wound there we conscious you sin against Christ um wherefore if meat make my brother to offend I will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest I make my brother to offenders so he's talking about eating and then when you eat something which offends another Warriors don't do it for the sake of your brother so even us now at our homes there are some things you may like what is open but they offend your husband or your wife now for the sake of being one in that marriage let go of the things that offend one another event take them off praise the name of Allah you love watching football until maybe three three a.m and your wife doesn't want it why would you insist on having that right praise the name of our Lord you like going maybe to clubs or whatever places or there are some of your friends and your wife is not comfortable with them why would you stick yourself to such people or maybe the same thing you'll find that in some areas the husband is complaining about the friends of the wife and the other woman has done this she broke the other horse you know you get here those kind of things if you find that your husband or wife is complaining about something you like doing it why do you continuously offend him while you continuously offend here or when you go to this place this thing happens when your spirit is dividing so this is what the Bible is so now we are looking now at our actions as husband and wife that are not pleasing to the others you know he's offended by this she is offended by this let it go and then have the peace why would you cleave to somebody not your wife or your husband to love to lose peace at your home so you need to let go of offensive things if there is something that is not pleasant to your wife get rid of it that is not pleasant to your husband get rid of it so you are so much considerate one to another queen see the Bible says let us be like-minded praise the name of us feeling for one another let us got Philippians chapter 2. foreign be there for any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any boils and masses foreign praise the name of our Lord the brother at home is quiet but when he goes to his place of work he's so talkative Allah then you start wondering what's Happening Here at a place of work is where he took everybody knows and everybody is just you know happy to have him around he's funny he makes a lot of jobs but now when he gets at his homework it shouldn't be like that instead of all of your best let your wife find it in you praise but then you will find it is so strange and then you can also find a woman [Music] I wish those are but when he gets home very rough concerned is the name of our Lord but all your goodness all the things that God has bestowed upon you should belong to your wife or to your husband if they are talking about Good characters let the husband rejoice in your good Courage the wife rejoicing your good character let us be like-minded praise the name of Allah and the Bible says having one account and of one mind let nothing be done through Strife of vain Glory but in loneliness of mine Let each estimate the other better than themselves make sure praise the name of Allah that when you meet one foreign no it shouldn't be like that and when you are meeting Wonder Don't Start With criticism Where Have You Been why have you delayed no it shouldn't be like that praise the name of our Lord let there be warms that somebody is always feeling good to come back feeling good to be around until it is difficult to live one another okay that's our home should be but not coming home I don't know when the night will end praise the name of our Lord not during the times of Corona obviously you know they are parents when the children are coming home they say we have traveled so they come back when the children are asleep or maybe wife but when Corona came I couldn't already die all people are forced to live together there were no televisions there were no clubs no drinking places we shouldn't wait for Corona to bring us together because we are family let us have joy to be together as a family let it be a joke for a husband sit together with the wife father and mother to sit with their children that's been a family that God should have praise the name of Allah so then the Bible says let nothing be done through Strife of vain Glory but in loneliness of mine the other better than themselves like maybe you may be in a position you know like sometimes a wife may be having a better job than the husband together but getting more money does not make you the head but you need to have that loneliness of mine praise the name of it like there is a scenario I know of yeah the husband lost her job lost his job and then now the wife was working but now what's the Mother-in-law of the husband did the mother of the wife would call the son-in-law and some sending you support what is it but don't tell your wife I'm done was given you I talk about it despise you you know she was so interested in a family praise the name of Allah and so we need to see that we avoid things of competition in a home let us be one-minded and giving support to one another praise the name of us and likewise if you were a husband I can remember brother Brandon when he was going to marry Hulk and then you know he was saying no open's father was very rich and then for him he would make just a small money a week but he said I'm committed to make sure that my hands Bruce Bruce to make sure that I take care of your daughter we will also be willing to work praise the name of foreign but there was when the son of these things they were going back to God intervened when I left home and then the Lord told him go and be obedient to your mistress when Abraham was heard about Sarah telling him that Chester with this is so we need to see that whatever troubles we have better government problems this is what we are going through praise the name of us you know there are many promises let us look at some of them praise the name of Allah let us go to Proverbs chapter 18 verse 22. give him praise the name of our Lord Proverbs 18 22. a wife findeth a good thing and obtains favor of the Lord so if you have found the wife if you have a wife you have four good things and the Bible says you have already obtained the favor of God promises praise the name of Allah but don't look what your wife as a cast oh I wish I didn't get hurt there's something wrong with you foreign take it as so special take care of him as very special even the children you have there are no better children their neighbors children are not the better children for you Neighbors praise the name of us so whatever God has given you in your household is the best thank you for my wife Lord I Thank you for my husband thank you for my children and then you will see the goodness that God has put in them if you don't appreciate it you don't see the good things you'll not see the favor the favor that God has given you praise the name of us but we need to learn how to appreciate it and say Lord I Thank you and then you see how you can work on one another's weakness all the weakness you think your husband has well enough foreign tell me but conscious of what they were doing she makes this day throw down because then they vomit they do everything and then she started singing but Jesus bear the cross alone yes he was not doing it with bitterness but she was doing it with love with the loneliness of mine no more windows and at the end of the day she won all of them to Christ the name of us and he said the Bible tells us you don't pay evil for evil do good but then you'll find some families if the husband doesn't do this the wife also will not do this handle your role according to the scriptures and then you'll be able to win the one that the Bible says that if you are married to somebody is another believer you sanctify him you as a man as a person is a Believer he will make reason so the more he looks at your life you are able to bring him to God praise the name of our Lord so don't think of another alternative husband or wife don't don't start saying I wish I'm the one who got married God has given you your husband God has given you away walk upon your life praise the name of it so the Bible says let us be like mine praise the name of Allah let us go to Romans chapter 15. praise the name of the Lord I have very few minutes left Romans chapter 15 and then verse 1. the Bible says we then that that from ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves like maybe in your home either the wife is weak or the husband this week oh you find he has a lot of infirmities foreign for even Christ please not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached foreign learn to serve in this one's weakness let everyone feel the gap of the other when they are not around but when your wife is not around and you don't miss her there is a problem or when your husband is not around and you feel I'm so peaceful because it's not around those are problems but when you are one you feel you say oh I wish you would come back I wish I wish she was around praise the name of it and that's how we can raise our children when we are one as husband and wife and we give them such a good example foreign children as a husband and a wife together your children will be complete but if there is a problem at home you'll find that children have complexes maybe they don't have self-esteem at school or with friends the festival they are always afraid but yeah and this is also how we hand our children at school you know if you are going to tell your children you are foolish you are making them fools if you tell your children you are imparting those negative things but learn to appreciate your children even if they have been making many mistakes see something and say thank you for doing it to do this let us just learn to raise our family in the way of the Lord amen amen now let us go to Matthew chapter 19. Matthew chapter 19. and then read from verse 3 to verse 10. the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put out his wife for every cause of and he answered and said unto them have you not read that which made them at the beginning made them male and female is and say for this cause shall a man live father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they trying shall be one flesh nagamba into a month wherefore they are no more trying but one flesh what they are for God has joined together let no man put asunder um and they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he says unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so much foreign now when you were married to Baba fumble we shouldn't have the hardness of heart between Alcove you don't want to hear when you're being corrected you don't want to consider the other one's opinion he was just stuck in your life [Music] because hardness of hearts Fatima praise the name of the name of bricks the other party chicosa oh it greets the other one with Spirits praise the name of our Lord but you know when you have you know a broken heart a contrite spirit and the God Scripture says I dwell with such people with the contrite and a broken hearted yourself be sincere to one another I'm very sorry for this has been listening to each other's opinions be able to bear with one another but not having the hardness of Hearts until you cannot reconcile okay until you don't consider what offends your wife or your husband [Music] foreign and then in verse 14. he says yet you see you say wherefore because the Lord has been witnessed between the and the wife of thy youth against whom though has to dealt treacherously yet she is thy companion and the wife of thy covenants he says and then in verse 7. he says likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife and as as unto the weaker vessel and being here as together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered um praise the name of Allah so in my life chapter 2 verse 14 he said you've dealt treacherously but then the issue we should be the solution to that is First Peter chapter 3 verse dwell with them according to knowledge you know there is a difference between dealing and dwelling foreign [Music] but when you have your chicken you dwell with the chicken you don't deal with the chicken so the Bible is telling us let us not deal with one another I'll deal with it like a class teacher telling a student a person to deal with you then you know what's going on together that should not be the way we deal with our wives it shouldn't be like that as a home but the Bible says dwell with them in other words you are pleased to live together pleased to be together praise the name of Allah so we need to see how we can continue being one in our marriage let us be like-minded forgiving courteous [Music] foreign not yet foreign and your family will amen [Applause] we are children end of the father we are joined own of his wife [Music] we are
