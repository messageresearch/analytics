[21:14] may you grant bless us Lord
[21:17] speak to us
[21:19] revealing and manifesting yourself
[21:22] we love you Lord and we thank you Lord
[21:25] have preeminence upon these songs in the
[21:28] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:31] amen amen let us go to Luke chapter 22.
[21:37] Luke Chapter 22.
[21:40] reading from verse 28 to verse 34.
[21:46] so the Bible says
[21:49] you are they which have contained with
[21:52] me in my Temptations and I appoint unto
[21:56] you a kingdom as my father has appointed
[21:59] unto me that you may eat and drink at my
[22:03] table in my kingdom and sit on Thrones
[22:07] judging the 12 tribes of Israel and the
[22:10] Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan as
[22:14] desire to have you that he may sift you
[22:18] as wheat but I have prayed for you that
[22:22] your faith fail not and when you are
[22:24] converted strengthen thy Brethren and he
[22:28] said unto him Lord I am ready to go with
[22:31] thee both into prison and to death and
[22:35] they say I tell the Peter the shall
[22:38] not crawl this day before that thou Hast
[22:40] the right deny that thou knowest me
[22:45] name where is
[23:15] foreign
[23:51] foreign
[23:55] foreign
[24:47] he says but I have prayed for you
[24:51] that your faith fail not okay this is
[25:01] strengthen thy Brethren
[25:05] so I want to preach on strengthen thy
[25:07] brethrens
[25:10] for maybe about one hour oh God it's
[25:13] good to be gracious
[25:15] strengthen thy Brethren
[25:19] praise the name of Allah now in the
[25:22] seven Church age books
[25:25] in the exposition of the seven churches
[25:29] the sadian church Age
[25:32] The Prophet says
[25:35] Be watchful
[25:39] and strengthen the things which remain
[25:45] that are ready to die every attack
[25:49] now the ideas expressed in the two words
[26:02] to watch
[26:05] contains not only the idea of being
[26:08] awake teach together
[26:12] but to be alert
[26:15] Ori
[26:17] William nada to be otherwise instinuates
[26:21] danger and loss
[26:24] to strengthen means more than just to
[26:27] give strength
[26:31] it means to fix and establish for
[26:35] permanency
[26:41] these two commands refer to what is left
[26:43] of the truth
[26:48] which itself is really all about to die
[26:51] for
[26:57] praise the name of our Lord let me jump
[26:59] there says strengthen yourself
[27:06] now in what you have left
[27:08] in such a manner
[27:11] as to permanently establish
[27:16] what you have
[27:18] and ensure against future loss
[27:27] this word strengthen here
[27:30] which we have read in Luke chapter 20
[27:33] verse 32.
[27:36] it means to establish together
[27:58] [Music]
[28:01] so in other words
[28:05] if God has fixed you in a certain
[28:08] position
[28:14] you need to be established
[28:18] you need to be steady fast
[28:22] like now in this end of the sadistan
[28:25] church
[28:27] it was you know the age
[28:30] of you know bringing back the truth
[28:36] praise the name of our Lord it was the
[28:39] age of Martin Luther
[28:41] where he preached they just shall live
[28:44] by faith
[28:46] and they just shall live by faith
[28:50] was a measure of light that age received
[28:55] you know during that the time of Martin
[28:58] Luther Martin Luther the Catholic church
[29:01] was teaching that salvation is by works
[29:04] and punishing yourself
[29:10] God reveals to Martin Luther
[29:13] and tells him that they just shall live
[29:16] by faith
[29:18] and that was the light that God
[29:20] permitted in that day
[29:23] so now the holy spirit is telling them
[29:27] hold the farm that which you have
[29:30] received
[29:32] you know the Revelation that has come to
[29:35] you
[29:36] and of course we know that the
[29:39] Revelation has gone further than that
[29:42] because when we look at the
[29:44] Philadelphian Church
[29:46] there was sanctification
[29:49] the father Revelation
[29:52] and then we come now to the Lord this
[29:55] year and then we see the Pentecostal
[29:58] moves the restoration of gifts it was a
[30:02] higher Revelation now we are living in a
[30:05] different day
[30:06] the word of God has been fully restored
[30:10] we have got the full revelation of the
[30:13] world
[30:14] so now as we have got the full
[30:17] revelation of the world
[30:18] we need to be established in the present
[30:22] truth
[30:24] praise the name of our Lord you need to
[30:27] be established in the present truth
[30:31] um
[30:32] no you're not going to be tossed to and
[30:34] fro
[30:36] many things that are coming up
[30:39] in different understandings that are
[30:41] coming up
[30:42] so to strengthens you know you need to
[30:46] be established
[30:47] you need to be found
[30:51] which you have received
[30:53] praise the name of our Lord and this is
[30:56] what the Lord wants us to do is that we
[31:00] dwell or we be established
[31:04] how then we need to be established in
[31:07] what we have received
[31:11] praise the name of our Lord when you
[31:14] hear the word of God you have received
[31:17] the word of the Lord how do you handle
[31:20] the word of God
[31:22] that's now the thing how do you handle
[31:26] the word of God
[31:27] and you see when you receive the word of
[31:30] God
[31:32] you need to receive the word of God out
[31:34] of a pure heart
[31:51] and then the Bible says God will not
[31:55] despise such a heart
[31:59] in Psalms 51.
[32:03] and then verse 16.
[32:07] for the desire is not sacrifice else I
[32:12] would give it for though the lightest
[32:14] not in bad offering
[32:18] um
[32:30] the sacrifices of God are a broken
[32:34] Spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh
[32:38] God though will not despise
[32:48] so that's the heart that God wants
[33:06] and then verse 1.
[33:09] therefore saying we've received this
[33:12] ministry as we have received the mercy
[33:15] we faint not
[33:18] foreign
[33:50] foreign
[34:06] but by manifestation of Truth commanding
[34:10] ourselves
[34:11] one to every man is conscious in the
[34:14] sight of God
[34:21] oh
[34:24] sorry
[34:26] last verse 3.
[34:31] amazing
[34:33] there is
[34:39] now
[34:40] so he says we have
[34:45] Twitter
[34:49] things
[34:51] you know
[34:53] you know
[34:55] you are not working in craftiness
[35:02] when we receive the word of God
[35:05] we need to have such Humble Hearts
[35:10] that we obey the word of God
[35:14] you know because our hearts are the
[35:17] ground
[35:20] our hearts at the ground
[35:24] you know and there are four kinds of
[35:26] grounds
[35:29] there is the West Side Hearts
[35:33] the heart which is like a west side
[36:36] in a good ground
[36:38] one
[36:43] [Music]
[37:26] Colossians chapter 1
[37:32] Colossians chapter 1 and verse 10.
[37:38] the Bible says
[37:45] let us start from verse 10 verse 9.
[37:50] for this course we also since the day we
[37:53] had it do not cease to pray for you and
[37:57] to desire that you might be filled with
[38:01] the knowledge of his will in all wisdom
[38:03] and spiritual understanding okay
[38:24] that you might walk worthy of the Lord
[38:27] and to all pleasing
[38:30] being fruitful in every good work and
[38:34] increasing in the knowledge of God
[38:38] okay
[38:42] foreign
[39:06] strengthened with all might according to
[39:09] his glorious power and to all patience
[39:12] and long-suffering with joyfulness
[39:18] um
[39:22] no
[39:25] um
[39:29] no I mean he says
[39:34] the desire is a commands that you might
[39:39] be filled with the knowledge
[39:42] of his will
[39:45] in all wisdom and spiritual
[39:48] understanding
[39:51] and that you walk
[39:55] praise the name of our Lord You Have
[39:57] Known the way of the Lord so then the
[40:00] thing is if you have known the way of
[40:02] the Lord
[40:03] you need to walk in that way of the Lord
[40:09] so he says you've known that way
[40:13] then you walk in that way
[40:16] so it says that you may walk worthy
[40:22] before the Lord in other words whatever
[40:26] you are doing you're doing it from the
[40:28] bottom of your heart
[40:31] when you speak to somebody you're not
[40:34] hiding
[40:52] [Music]
[41:31] that's how it happened is that allow
[41:35] your heart
[41:37] receive the word
[41:39] take away the Stony condition from your
[41:43] house
[41:44] take away the sunny condition from your
[41:47] house
[41:48] you know take away the West Side
[41:51] condition from your heart
[41:53] then that word of God
[41:57] establish you
[41:59] that word of God will strengthen you
[42:03] that nothing can come and move you okay
[42:08] this is what the scripture is
[42:11] you know you yourself
[42:15] you know you must purpose
[42:18] of received this word
[42:21] let me take a hold of it
[42:25] in my belief in it
[42:28] in My Confession of it in my obedience
[42:33] to it
[42:33] praise the name of Allah not talking it
[42:38] but the heart is
[42:41] praise the name of Allah but you see
[42:44] what you confess
[42:46] is exactly what is right inside
[42:50] praise the name of Allah
[42:54] let us go to First Corinthians chapter
[42:55] 15. to jump back on stage talking
[43:01] and then verse 58 Academy
[43:05] so the scripture says therefore my
[43:08] beloved Brethren be you steadyfast and
[43:12] movable always abounding in the work of
[43:15] the Lord for as much as you know that
[43:18] your labor is not in vain in the Lord
[43:22] foreign
[44:02] foreign praise the name of Allah so now
[44:05] Jesus Christ was telling Peter but yes
[44:08] when you are converted
[44:12] strengthen your brother
[44:16] you know you cannot establish somebody
[44:20] if you're not established
[44:22] praise the name of Allah if you are
[44:25] falling
[44:27] how do you hold somebody to stack you're
[44:30] also going to pull him to force
[44:32] so he was telling Peter
[44:35] first be converted when you are
[44:38] converted
[44:41] praise the name of Allah and our
[44:44] conversion
[44:45] comes with the baptism of the Holy
[44:48] Spirit
[44:51] when the spirit of God
[44:54] comes down in our hearts
[44:56] praise the name of our Lord and then you
[44:59] receive the life of Jesus
[45:02] the life of God himself to come down in
[45:06] us
[45:07] to take care of us to direct us
[45:13] so then you see that even when you are
[45:17] born again yourself
[45:20] you need to be strengthened or you know
[45:25] you need to be established
[45:28] let us go to First Peter chapter 1.
[45:34] First Peter chapter one
[45:37] dollar
[45:39] and then verse 22.
[45:41] seeing you have purified your souls in
[45:45] obeying the truth through the spirit and
[45:48] to unfeigned love of Brethren see that
[45:51] you love one another with a pure fervent
[45:55] Hearts amazing
[46:02] galanga
[46:08] okay
[46:13] momotima no
[46:15] no
[46:17] praise the name of our Lord he said
[46:20] obeying the truth
[46:25] so you obey the truth
[46:27] when you hear the word of God and when
[46:31] you obey the truth the Bible says in
[46:35] Ephesians
[46:42] verse 13. that's right
[46:44] in whom you also trusted after that you
[46:48] had the word of Truth The Gospel of your
[46:51] salvation in whom also after you
[46:53] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[46:56] Spirit of promise
[47:00] Ephesians 1 13.
[47:09] amen is
[47:19] foreign
[47:29] [Music]
[48:04] not of the corruptible seed but of The
[48:07] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[48:10] liveth and abideth forever
[48:15] um
[48:30] praise the name of our Lord being born
[48:33] again
[48:35] not of the craftable seed foreign
[49:24] foreign
[50:07] and you know
[50:38] and then they take them
[50:41] then they take them
[50:45] when they take them to hospitals I'm
[50:48] forgetting the word they use
[50:49] this praise the name of our Lord there
[50:52] is that chart of the child from the time
[50:54] he's born
[50:57] praise the name of our Lord and then
[51:00] they went the child at Birth
[51:02] and so maybe the child is 3.5 kilos
[51:08] then they say you come back after three
[51:10] months or six months
[51:12] we are going to give disseminization
[51:16] so maybe they put the itemization for 13
[51:19] hours
[51:21] or for whatever and then they measure
[51:24] the child
[51:24] and then they measure now supposing this
[51:28] child is still three point is 3.5
[51:34] that chart has graphs
[51:39] and now your child is still flat but
[51:43] your money
[51:44] do you feed your childhood
[51:48] they measure growth by weight
[51:52] if your child is weight is really very
[51:55] low
[51:56] um
[51:57] then they said this child needs a lot of
[51:59] care that is a child may die
[52:10] but it depends on your reception of the
[52:14] word of God
[52:16] how much time are you giving to the Lord
[52:19] I know the scripture says man shall not
[52:23] live by bread alone
[52:27] but by every word I've reached gamble
[52:31] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[52:33] that means we have in continuous feeding
[52:37] on the world
[52:39] you continuously feed on that word
[52:43] you have continuously reading the
[52:45] message of the hours
[52:47] you continuously hearing the message
[52:51] and as you keep on hearing as you keep
[52:54] on feeding
[52:56] you know you are growing by what you are
[52:59] here
[53:02] praise the name of our Lord you are
[53:04] growing by the things you give your
[53:06] attention too
[53:09] and this is how we are strengthened
[53:12] this is how we establish
[53:15] praise the name of our Lord so you
[53:18] cannot put away your time into you
[53:21] cannot do our without putting your time
[53:23] in it
[53:25] you need to put time there or not you
[53:28] ever say that in the things of God
[53:29] taking time to read the words
[53:36] you see that's Revelation 1 3.
[53:45] let us go to Revelations
[53:48] and then verse 3 and so I upset
[53:53] Revelation 1 3.

[1:10:31] and somebody thinks that it's doing them
[1:10:34] anything better
[1:10:38] praise the name of our Lord so we need
[1:10:40] to see that we don't avoid fellowship

[1:12:03] of teaching
[1:12:05] Doctrine knowing what is the truth what

[1:12:14] so Jesus told Peter yes

[1:12:21] praise the name of Allah now as I finish
[1:12:25] let us go second Peter chapter one
[1:12:28] in surrender
[1:12:30] and then we start reading from verse
[1:12:32] three
[1:12:34] and then verse 8.
[1:12:39] says according as his divine power has
[1:12:42] given unto us all things that pertain
[1:12:45] unto life and godliness through the
[1:12:48] knowledge of him that has called us to
[1:12:51] glory and virtue
[1:12:53] za
[1:13:13] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:13:16] great and precious promises that by this
[1:13:20] you might be partakers of the divine
[1:13:23] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:13:26] that's in the world through lust
[1:13:28] is
[1:13:40] foreign foreign
[1:14:15] godliness brotherly kindness and brother
[1:14:18] kindness charity
[1:14:20] foreign
[1:14:49] foreign
[1:14:55] foreign
[1:15:05] for if these things be in you
[1:15:08] and abound they make you that you shall
[1:15:11] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[1:15:15] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:23] foreign
[1:15:40] you need to have he has given unto us
[1:15:43] according yet exceedingly great and
[1:15:47] precious promises
[1:15:49] and that is by his power
[1:15:52] the power that transforms us
[1:15:55] and as you keep on growing in him
[1:15:59] because you start with faith
[1:16:02] as you have faith in the world so the
[1:16:06] same words
[1:16:08] your kind of you know your commitment to
[1:16:10] him
[1:16:15] knowledge
[1:16:17] Temperance
[1:16:19] Temperance patience
[1:16:24] then godliness
[1:16:31] you are being established you are
[1:16:35] becoming

[1:18:13] strengthened praise the name of Allah so
[1:18:17] then the master can come for the Harvest
[1:18:20] praise the name of our Lord
[1:18:23] and then the Bible says in John chapter
[1:18:26] 15. that if a tree a branch does not
[1:18:30] bear fruit
[1:18:32] you know first there is a condition
[1:18:35] where you're not bearing

[1:20:24] so there is a fruit bearing fruit
[1:20:27] and then there's bearing more fruits
[1:20:30] and then it's bearing much fruits
[1:20:37] we need to be strengthened in the Lord

[1:21:03] but the quality of the spirit of
[1:21:06] godliness
[1:21:08] because it says coming for a church
[1:21:11] without spots
[1:21:15] without any blemish
[1:21:20] that's what Christ is coming
[1:21:22] so he was telling
[1:22:18] so you connect from him
[1:23:18] it's a reality
[1:23:21] somebody's so traveled
