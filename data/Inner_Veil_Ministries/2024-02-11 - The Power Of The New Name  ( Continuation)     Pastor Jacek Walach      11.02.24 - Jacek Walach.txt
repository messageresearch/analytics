========================================

in my country the most immoral churches are Pentecostals Catholics are more moral Catholics are more moral they coming to church generally clothed but the Pentecost the women horrible painted Jezebel the spirit just took grip of the church they have a [Applause] slack dancing showing jewelry naked shame but this is loud this year according to the Bible yes when you go to Catholic Church they don't have a disco in the church no no they have a routine their ly their tradition they also that amen Jesus would call it a grave Jesus would call it grave painted grave but inside is problem but not with the Overcomers it's not the problem inside of the Overcomer inside of the Overcomer there's a white stone with a new name inside the mystery inside Anytime someone overcomes God is changing the name what about Abraham and Sarai God changed names Amen in the 7 chapter book of Genesis this is Abraham andah amen she was in the message I I'm the message since many many years my husband is a prophet God promised as a child my name is sah you know like sometimes the ladies are coming to church high heels my goodness you know I saw one time in my church woman with the high heels I preach three times against the spirit until she cease to come ministers we have a Ministry to casting out demons from the if you are casting out demon and the demon doesn't want to get out so the person will go with the demon out it still the success of the ministry brother he said too many pastors that are tolerating demons in the [Applause] church high heels may God help us I was in Rwanda I was in Tanzania I saw it in many places Cong Believers high heels Strong Rock music my goodness it looks horrible I don't want to say what I [Applause] feel but when the prophet of the hour saw something like this what he said he saw a witch leading the churches he was crying he was broke down he said everything in vain everything in vain they looking like a prostitute he was crying and then the an Vision came a preview of The Bride hallelujah hallelujah the the BST was covered no I hears no earrings no makeup because that's what brother saw beyond the C of time hallelujah hallelujah people today they want to just prove something they are showing the picture of the family of brother Bram you you see you see his daughters you see maid this is the standard I don't believe it I don't believe it standard is behind the pulpit amen [Applause] amen Moses was taken up to heaven he got the blueprint of the temple God told him I want to dwell among you but keep the blueprint do it exactly God took brother God took Paul to heaven and they got the blueprint Paul was building as a wise Master he put a right kind of foundation he didn't tolerate many things the church Mali for prophet when he was taken up there these are the women with a covered body man was also covered I don't talk only to Sisters I'm hoping there's no brothers here walking around with their shorts because he are another candidate for the Rapture you are Cece you you receive a spirit of your wife you weak and [Applause] soft amen the blueprint Came From Heaven as the Bride of Jesus Christ we are peculiar people we are different elected special don't confirm yourself to this world stay separated heav na vow Naz vow God is coming in the S chapter book of Genesis he speaks to Abraham just take a strength from me I am sh feed yourself until your body will be changed but in the 18th chapter of Genesis three men are coming two angels and Elohim how the middle one the Elohim is addressing to the man and woman he said to Abraham where is your wife sah the eye was cut the eye was di she was not anym s she was s his name was Abraham how Abraham knew it was God because no one knew about the change of the name people they were mocking of the for 24 years oh your father of Nations ABR don't call me this way I introduced today my wife her name is change please in the neighborhood and no one in the house don't call her Sarai she's receiving a new name I'm not Abram anymore I'm Abraham what the people they thought about them they are double crazy old people changing the names yes because under the old name they couldn't have a child and under the old name you will not go to Rapture your body will not be transformed under old name you have to meet him here you have to hear from your theop God will have to start to deal with you you can have the best name you can say my papa is a preacher my mama is a Sunday school teacher my father is a deacon my wife she's so beautiful my husband Never Smoke never drink we are born the message you are too heavy sorry are too heavy it requires a power of transformation to change your body amen then you will be light free no burden go up Amen brother Bram he said the had to be changed this is on Jehovah J 62 there has got to be changed before things happened he couldn't not give them the child as long as their names remain dead this is serious friends don't wait in heaven to hear your new name Peter he was first Simon but when he met Messiah and was a different opinions who Jesus is he asked the disciples he he asked the Pastors in the message what do you think whose son of man is opinions Elijah Jeremiah but Peter he was inspired he got the spark Spark if you want to have a fire you need a spark he said you are Christ son of the Living God you are not Simon anymore you are Peter you are blessed amen and you are getting Keys what about us if you want to rule over over your vessel if you want to rule over your temperament maybe our Temptations are high in your life you will never defeat it by punching in air you will only lose your strength you must be more precisely when you will get the revelation of the new name brother what is it what it is I should go to an maybe to con [Applause] Orab that's here that's here if you love this book and you receive the evening Light That Came Upon This Book to Enlighten the scripture after scripture I would tell you one thing verses in the Bible are the names of the Believers promises in the Bible are the new names of the [Applause] Believers but don't look back to history don't look in Abraham his name was change Jacob to Israel amen Saul to Paul this is history this part of the Bible was manifested already but somewhere here is your page some here is your scripture some here was cified about the bride the rise up a church without a spot without the wrinkle without any such a thing will be a perfect bride reflection of God you are here amen do you know that seven tunders reveal his new name oh it's interesting seven Thunders I need a ticket to go to New York no no you don't need any tickets amen new name of God was revealing the Thunders but seven Thunders after the voices the Seven Seals one by one was broken new name of Jesus is under seals he was wrapped around for ages but he unwrapped himself he's standing unveiled meeting his bride his wife in the sleeping in the sleeping room in the sleeping room her body belongs to him her body belongs to him his body belongs to her there in the sleeping room toal mystery but not for these two Union time amen amen when the seven times is after the voices new name of God was revealed brother said does the they are shouting and Hing today in the churches and they are getting nothing because that's in the Thunders the Thunder is the Revelation outside of the Bible or inside of the Bible your pastor told you already that the Thunders are in the Bible amen the Thunder is a voice the Thunder is for the people but the voice is very personal for you amen when Jesus prayed thundered but he heard the father but the people outside they heard the Thunders there today there's so much noise and

every time a victory is won or something goes on the name is change the first seal amen amen 1 2 3 paragraph every time there is a victory name is change amen I will give you example in the 30s of

put a dynamite inside amen and did explosion The Rock was open for two sides making an open path for the people Amen in 1963 in middle of January brother is going to to the Sabino Canyon he's going to
