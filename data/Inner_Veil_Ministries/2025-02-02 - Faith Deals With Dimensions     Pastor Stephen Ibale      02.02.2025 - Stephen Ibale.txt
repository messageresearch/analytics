[Music] [Applause] my you this morning amen [Music] 11se [Music] amen so the scripture says [Music] now is the substance of things of the of bless the reading of this [Music] fors I think you know that we have seven dimensions we have the original Dimension which is the highest Dimension that's the dimension of God himself ET were angs there was no nothing he existed amen and then after the creation then we've got the ofer and so he to create di will amen and then after that know heated [Music] when [Music] [Applause] created but then we have to know when God created man control [Music] [Music] know the isir that's how he ruled the creation and then when time was come that it was necessary to te the ground then God put man in the dimension amen which all these other human uh creatures were able to live in which is time and amen because naturally in the flesh we deal with matter this is matter here this is matter this man here in the natural body is matter but for me to have a link to him I need light without I cannot be able to deal with matter and now we need time to dictate amen is it so fast that I need to do it so time light and matter are the dimensions where the natural man lives but in this Dimension man fell and when he fell it was necessary that God would still want to deal with man but he cannot deal with him exactly physically amen because he had fallen so he created a dimension of faith that man would deal with God by faith and that's what we still have amen we deal with God by faith that's why the scripture says faith is the substance of things which eyes do not see amen by faith are you Sav are you together with me and you believe it you know eyes cannot declare it cannot declare that you are Sav that's a CH of faith that picks you from your fall connects you back to God the of the Holy Ghost amen so that's a CH now after Adam fell you know God needed a l to come and clean that se out of the human race so when Adam would die God made a way of trying to accomodate man amen he cannot go to hell but yet he needed a total cleansing of the blood of Jesus Christ are you together with me so God allow the sixth Dimension that if you die you go under the altar amen and you wait there until all Redemption is done until all the Brotherhood is done CLE amen so we deal with Dimension so when God gave adam faith that faith would actually be able to touch Dimensions the dimensions of the Unseen for Adam he would touch the dimension of God himself amen that's where the prophets would go and they would say and I saw that's Vision oh and I heard God talk to them so those are images and voices but then the devil also SED through this fourth dimension that through that fourth dimension a witch can be able to talk to the devil a witch can also see Vision which comes from the Dimension Faith deals with Dimensions now I'll speak about faith from the Ang of the chrisan amen yes sir so faith is activated by the Holy Ghost to the seed gen in the heart over things that I cannot see cannot hear have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that level so faith is a revelation of the realities that already exist in a dimension which man cannot physically touch and preaching now when a man is preaching he's basically trying to answerer people into those Supernatural promises amen and what you are here for is that Lord help the p so that he can us into that Dimension so that you can touch God this morning that when you go home you can be able to say we have heard from God Amen that's what we are doing preaching is intended to lift you from your natural weaknesses Amen to bring you into the presence of God that you yourself when you get into that presence you may be able to claim from God Amen praise the Lord so you know we preach people you know into the of God Amen to build themselves into you know uh verses that God will be able to to use Amen Let me say something like this when one preaches right the people will build the faith that brings God down and his promises can be able to be accessed but then when the m is handled negatively amen open the people into negative are you together with me yeah when the world is preached right it brings you before God if the word is preached negatively amen it also opens you into the negative Channel soals with dimensions that's why the scripture says the soul that Seth shall die and the soul is designed in such a way that it has operate by one gate amen you either have the Gate of Faith or you have the Gate of doubt that's the way God made man amen he gave him a soul and all of us amen when we are born if you are a child of God there is an element which we call the seed gen of God it's inside the soul but it is [Music] asleep are you together with me it's like the seed that was in the ground at the creation but it was asleep waiting for the light to come forth and then God would command let every seed bring forth of it that was the Awakening of the SE and therefore every seed then would bring forth of its so all of us amen good or amen when we are born you see we are born in let me put it this way let me talk from The Young of the believer the elect when he's born that seed is in there and and that seed always pops a little bit because it's a live seed and then you say why should I smoke you drop the cigarette for about one week and then the flesh here overpowers you you buy another cigarette I know many of you never smoked those control people a man would go and drink that seed would shake up but why do I drink he throws away the bottle after some time that would want the again and then you drink and then you come back home you begin to cry who will save me from this drinking I don't like it but you are a prisoner and now when the word is preached amen and that seed hears the word and it comes to life are you together with me in that Soul there Rises the you know uh uh the the sense of faith that when the word is preached there is something in you that always receives the word and then you start fighting your battles against the flesh from within the soul then that Soul doesn't sin but that Soul fights against sin are you together with me and then the other person who is not an elect he only has one sense also the soul and that's the sense of doubt he doesn't have Revelation in there because Faith gives Revelation but this other man here has got the sense of doubt doubt means that you can see the reality but then you doubt it it be true all these men out there in the world you can preach to them the word and they can almost agree with it but there is a sense of Doubt which PLS that seed out but you a Son of God you have got faith when the word comes to you sometimes you don't even understand faith is Revelation are you together with me Faith is the Revelation there is something in you that will may not explain it I believe it and as you keep going on faith keeps breaking Revelation and at the end of the day you are going to be Sav that you never doubted are you together with me so at the New Birth the gate changes its nature hallelujah hallelujah When Faith is [Music] activated when the of the new birth starts working in you God begins by revealing that you were ordained to eternal life then you start to H for more amen you cannot be you know willing to stay home when the church do are open amen you H for the word H opens the default gate of Faith to make you a Believer and at this point I want tell [Music] you hallelujah hallelujah he moves from your soul to come down to the spirit Hallelujah are you together with me when your seed chin is awaken and you thirst for the word the devil which occupied that spot begins to get defeated he draws from the soul to the human spirit that in the soul there is no more doubt [Music] there's no more way of weighing the word of God when the word comes to you it is always amen and whenever you amen the word then the word amen begins to open greater lights so that you may walk in the light amen and when that word has broken the light of life in the soul of a Believer I tell you the devil that Ed that spot before drops down to the human spirit and he still continues his battles in Galatians chapter 5 verse 17 but this time is not fighting for the soul are you together with me he's fighting from the human spirit amen so G 57 for the flesh against the spirit amen your flesh here is a dead thing without your human Spirit are you together with me when the spirit walks out the body is dead so when Paul says the flesh lth against the spirit is actually talking about what your human Spirit causes your amen for the flesh L against the spirit and the spirit against the FLH and these are contr the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would hallelujah hallelujah in your human spirit the devil will continue the fight he was against the spirit of God that dwells in the soul because the spirit of God him and he came to a lower level but even from there he kept sending missiles [Applause] amen trying to aim at the Holy Spirit which is seated in the soul but let me tell you God never loses a battle are you together with me yeah what the devil shoot amen how does he shoot the last of the eye the last of the flesh the pride of life amen these are battles that areed to bring down the Lord Jesus Christ from the Throne of your soul but let me tell you the Temptations of your flesh is not your fault those are battles and continue fighting and overcome he bring a mind to you but that's not your fault that's the devil fighting against you fighting against the holy spirited in the Throne of your soul amen who had these battles in his life praise God The Book of Romans 7 and verse 14 Paul says for we know that the LA is Spirit but I am amen commit to a man that is natural amen and therefore the natural man could not be able to perform a spiritual amen for that which I do I allow not for what I would do that I do not but what I hate that I do if then I do that which I would not I that good now let me say this the intentions of the law were spiritual but when minded of the man he had no strength within him to perform that law right so we come to a point where the Holy Spirit must take over are you together with me to come to a point like where he says no longer I but Christ that lives in me so Christ the first thing he does is to take his SP by Awakening your seed how will you know that your seed gen is awaken because you hate evil and you would love light hallelujah hallelujah and now when you do that you open up for a w the devil will never leave you he will light you doesn't like you where does that voice come from that voice comes from your human Spirit it doesn't come from the soul reject those voices amen praise God so Paul suffered those things amen and verse 24 of that chapter he says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death amen that was the battle PA was in it and when Paul says I have fought a good fight his fight was not hate the brothers who don't believe like him when he says I fought a good fight he was not fighting brothers that don't support his ministry no sir when he says I fought a good fight he had fought to overcome the human Spirit the flesh which fights against the soul so that Soul realized that without Christ there is no Victory against the flesh so the Cry of the Soul was a cry for a higher [Music] Dimension and Christ came down to meet that need therefore our Victory is Christ at the center and the believer feeding the center with the word of God the word in our marriages amen we then allow the word in our entire families the word in charge of our church the word in charge with whatsoever I decide to do that's how we can overcome amen is at the center where we are connected to the [Music] dimensions are you together with me at the center there which is the S that's the Connecting Point to the dimensions amen so all the preaching is fighting for that s bad preaching is fighting for that s if anything can catch your soul it can connect you to a negative Dimension praise the Lord L therefore what we feed on determines where your soul will open to dimes God rations deeper understanding touch the fth dimension demonic world to your life are you together with me so when you come to church I want you to understand that you are presenting yourself to spirit world if a man preaches his lifestyle that's where you are going to open to you say you're a Christian and you don't KN down to greet people you you say you're Christian preaches culture to prove a person as the holy ghost that church ladies are very humble because they believe that's the holy GH I went to a church and then the man was preaching a woman cannot be above a man and so this is ladies they get around brother they go down and those things control people are you here with me so we really need to know that we are the and once you are in the right word always be patient the word will perform its work okay every doctr connects you to a spirit world so whatever doctr men will [Music] teach there will be spirits come down to back up that so be careful of what you Fe are you together with me you see this is how interesting it is and that's what people don't understand you see I don't want to be very graphic when I'm talking this but whatever Spirit you subject yourself to it will always be able to do something in your life if a Doctrine is preached that to prove you have the Holy Ghost you must climb the tallest tree even the biggest sister here L they will always be a spirit present because the faith connects you to Dimensions the true preaching to the seventh Dimension and the negative preaching also have a channel it will open you so you should always be [Music] willing to only says the Lord so that you can be guided by the word amen so let's position ourselves we therefore must understand the message of the hour not as in quote bye but as is generally laid out because in the Bible there are certain stat which we can say eat and drink because tomorrow we die that's a quote in the Bible and you can bring it to the people eat and drink tomorrow we die and then the word drink you just say it is meaning alcohol but if you connect the entire line of the word you'll come to realize that the drunkards don't inherit the Kingdom but because you have brought just a quot You' C the mind of a man you can come with a quot like John 22 break Temple and in three days I raise it up and that was say in the presence of the temple and the man says hey this man says drink and I mean break this Temple and in three days I raised it up 4 years was this temp in building what is it is the problem of a and then the scripture says Jesus was meaning the temp of his body amen so now when we teach the word we must be able to take the people through the entire understanding of the world not to B people by one and then one quote here here is to deliver to you the Walk of God Amen so we must understand the general concept of the word the disciples needed to understand the general concept of the ministry of Christ to bring forth the New Testament in it true context and I want to say it's only PA who that concept perfectly hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord now I want to say something here which is very powerful and I want you to really follow that I want tell you that Christ was an Old Testament Ministry which opened up into the New Testament at are you together with me amen so understand me very well on this he to come under the order of Levi to establish the order of together with me let me show you some of the areas that would help you to know Jesus his ministry was under the Old Testament to get the Old Testament Saints to bring them in the New Testament are you together with me okay St Luke 2 verse 22 praise the Lord he had to be present at the temple as was required for the first born to be presented had to be presented to the temple as the Old Testament required the firstborn son so in St Luke 2 vers 21 to circum amen but Paul did not teach circumcision as was required in Genesis 172 are you together with me but Jesus subjected himself to circumcision another point he had to be washed at the Jordan River in a baptism to show the washing of the sacrifice that was done in the Old Testament before it was offered and not as a testimony of repentance that we do in the New Testament hallelujah hallelujah because for him he had nothing to repent his baptism was not a testimony of repentance his baptism was the Wasing of a sacrifice amen now another thing he went to synagogue on the Sabbath as was the custom in the Old Testament the fifth point when he cleansed the lepers he would tell them go and show yourself to the priest amen he observed the feast amen as the Fe of the Passover in MTH 26 verse let us go there he says now the first day of the feast Matthew 267 now the first day of the Feast of the unle bread the disciples came to Jesus saying unto him where thou that we prepare for to eat the pass he observed the [Music] feast and he said go into the city to se a man and say unto him the master says my time is at hand I'll keep the Passover at thy house with my disciples are you together with me so he was you know he was the Fulfillment of all the law all the ceremonies of the Old Testament spoke of him he was represented in all the sacrifices he was represented in all the feasts he was represented in the prophecy by the holy man are you together with me okay I will take you to Matthew 5:17 amen think not that I am come to destroy the law 15 [Applause] 517 amen all the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill all those spoke of Christ and when he came he walked through all of them fulfilling them they all pointed to his coming are you together with me so the law teaches that the law was a school master that had to seal by the coming of Leviticus 17 says the life is in the blood and I have given you that life on the altar hallelujah hallelujah meaning Christ at hallelujah hallelujah when he died that was the beginning of the New Testament are you together with me yes sir I'm coming so that we can be able to understand not just pick up a quot that no look at the entire concept and then be able to take a full story in one I was taught by an English lady and this is a lady who would give us notes in English I don't know have you ever been under such a school teacher not I'm not talking about literature now English language and you make notes in English and I always had so many questions she called me wise dick she cut my name and says Wick but you see one time she says never be R Among Us he says you'll pass by the stff and you hear the word susp and then after a few minutes you hear the name and then you run and say has been suspended you get this this and you get a doctor we don't want to do that amen so when we go to Romans 10 and verse four he says for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness everyone that amen so he fulf and seal it so that we may come to that the oldest was the image was the picture of the good things to come it was very in Christ in many different ways and when he came he had to walk through that shadow and then emerg as the true prophecy of the atonement are you together with me and so at that Feast of the Passover in 26 verse 28 he held the cup of wine in his arms and he says for this is my blood of the new testament which is Shar for many for the remission of are you together with me that by taking this wife you are [Music] symbolizing of the new testament which begins from when he pour his blood are you together with me so was the man who fully understood the new where Peter was with him would in certain are all these disciples STG in certain are PA had the revelation of the New Testament praise God these things you sit down and listen to them very so at the Crossing of The Testament there was no clear understanding of the New Testament until the Feast of pente I want you to remember I told it to you here when I was speaking about the evening and the morning the of Pentecost was not Perfection it was the Holy Ghost coming upon Liv bread amen are you together with me it was the only Feast which had Liv in it all these other feasts were standing with Christ and Christ Alone the Passover the UN bread the first fruit but when it came to P invol you hallelujah hallelujah and me it involved man so in Leviticus 23 and verse 17 I want you to understand this very well ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two t Deals they shall be of fine flour they shall be Beacon with Leen they are the first fruits of the law of are you together with me so two were there on the p and both of them were living fruit I mean living bread that's the beginning of the ear Church the Jews and the Gentiles coming together two loes which had they were not perfect people so we need to understand that Pentecost was seed sewing time and that's why WR the New Testament are you together with me talk about Matthew talk about Mark talk about Luke talk about John they writing their relationship with Christ but when we come to Paul he's teaching the New Testament The Book of Romans the book of Gans the book of Corinthians the book ofes the book of the book ofon all those books there is teaching the New Testament Church is the one who teaches the New Testament Church the all that to walk with the church are you together with and then when you get Peter he has those epist but his major concern amen was the Jews that were dispersed but PA understood the two laws amen and he says God has got a for the Gentiles also amen amen am Peter could have the keys of God's Kingdom but PA had the New Testament amen so I want to say that Jesus did all those things go show yourself to the priests amen and you know circumcised on the and he did all those things but I want tell you when the disciples came that was not their gospel they did not go uh on the Sabbath to the synagogues are you together with me yeah they were separated from that because they understood now the New Testament are you together with me they were not saying anybody go and show yourself to the priest and they would even bring a quot Jesus went to the synagogue on every believe are you a message believer are you together with me you would have said praise the Lord you know they would say you blind man at the beautiful who now standing up walking running dancing sing Go and show yourself to the priest they didn't do that are you together with me the order had [Music] changed you see here he was sowing seeds for the New Testament but the quotes remain there they don't move you just have to understand the order of the holy spirit let us look at the ministry of brother are you together with me just like a Christ the greater part of brother bram's Ministry developed under Pentecost and yet Pentecost is a part of the Reformation is not a part of the Reformation amen it's a part of reformation not a part of the you know manifestation of the fulfilled work Pentecost was not a part of the restoration so like a Christ his ministry was in two parts the part of Moses which is the calling out of the people and the part of Joshua which ising them in Jesus had the part of calling them out and the cross he was blessing the by pouring the blood which would bring the Holy Ghost the so when we are dealing with the minister of brother brother we need wisdom of Revelation because we are dealing with a Ministry That Grew From Pentecost all the way to where we are so there is a part of his ministry which referred to by this statement the former Reigns and then he says those were teaching then he called it at another [Music] time time of Los and then another time he called it to the found but this stage was up by the opening of The Seven Seals hallelujah hallelujah all the ministry was leading us to the opening of The Seven SE like all the ministry of Christ was leading us to I mean to Cal and the pouring out of the Holy Ghost to begin a new testament brother all the way from the Baptist p through Pentecost was leading us to the opening of The Seven seeds and the opening of The Seven SE brother he says the Bible became a new book to me are you together with me I want you to go back home and listen back to this message that the Lord will give you Grace understand the dispensation of time amen so this stage was CED by the opening of The Seven seal and he says at the opening of The Seven Seals the ministry took a corner amen it took a turn and after his resurrection remember Christ did not go back into the synagogues after the resurrection even if it was a Sabbath he didn't go back he didn't go back amen the order of ministry turned and even brother BR after the opening of The Seven SE the order of the ministry I'll take you to this squad God's power to transform but since the opening of those Seven [Music] Seals of them Angels just behind the mountain this has become a new [Music] book meaning the Bible it is the things that is been he is being revealed as God promised in Revelation 10 he would do it and we are the privileged people that God has chosen on Earth that we might see and understand these things are you privileged has God chosen you to see these things amen he says which is not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it amen so he began to say things different after the opening of the seals and one of those things is the B of the Holy Ghost are you together with me theyve had always baptisms and baptisms but today is the true B of the Holy Ghost amen and the word true is not being opposed to false but it's rather a manifestation of what was coming in quarters quarters I want tell you it was baptism in the days of Luther there was the of the but in a quarter which was necessary for the age there was a b of the Holy Ghost in the days of wle it was a quarter that was necessary bring the conviction of amen for the of sanctification and there was also B of the Holy Ghost which was a particular quarter which caused the people to ask for signs and wonders and miracles that was also a quot ourselves here we have come to the true baptism which me the Gathering all those things Christ may be manifest Amen in his word praise God so he says in questions and answers of 1963 he says you see each one of those ages only had taken deep into the holy spirit amen every age the Holy Spirit has always been there but in different deeps in the message here him he says the r the just shall by faith and if you just believe it you got it no that's different because that was their emphasis the church shall live by faith but he says that this hour is more than that you see Paul in Acts 19 said amen to those people have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe so that lets that out the method Methodist the Methodist you got it when you shout amen that was he says then you got it when you shout that is your Methodist when you shout you got it they found out many shouted but they didn't have it are you together with me sister has been here long we had shouting we had dancing this floor was always full of people some prophesy I was telling people nobody can take us back into that disorder let them have the experience we had ours then he says and Pentecost come along the restoration of the gifts and they said when you speak with the tong you got it but they found out many spoke with Tong who didn't have it those things are all right but you can never measure [Music] on amen that's an attribute of the Spirit that's right and of those emotions which I believe in every one of them amen but that's not yet it holy spirit when you receive it it is a person of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ amen praise the Lord praise God Amen and Jesus Says by their fruits you shall know them so the true baptism is God forming his entire deeps amen which kept coming through the seven Church edges into the fullness of Christ himself to seal the believer not with emotions but rather the person of Christ himself theen amen praise God listen to stat of a perfect man he brought his church up the same way is bringing his people up then Peter here says first seven things Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you amen now why does he say the true baptism because the Holy Ghost kept growing with the church amen then when the lutherans they said when you afraid you've got it that was true the Methodist amen they got the excitement sanctification and they shouted that was the Holy Ghost but that was not the end of it it was just the Holy Spirit growing through and in Pentecost they spok in Tong was the Holy Ghost they had gifts that was true but all that was not the fullness of the Holy Ghost so when the fullness is come Accord to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you see what I mean brother Bram says Paul it is Paul he says that when when he that is perfect is come amen praise the Lord let us go to uh First Corinthians 13 do you love him this morning I think let me do my best cover up this then we shall go and comfort our sister amen First Corinthians when he that is perfect is come you give me that scripture when he that is perfect is come ver 10 I have a computer here now he has been speaking about different manifestations amen some who speak with Tes of angels some who prophesy some who have got amen and all those things but when it comes to verse 10 amen he says but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done he's saying all these things that you try to prophesy jump up and down he says all those things will pass away the perfect is come and sometimes they say now you mean no it's not me who mean it's the teaching of the message of the hour that some of those things will pass away you are not going to hold them as the evidence because they shouted and didn't have it I don't say you don't shout shout amen the word touches amen but don't say now I've got amen when God has given the true of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you he sees as to speak of the Holy Ghost as the anointing but the indwelling person the person him himself the Seal of life amen I want you to hear this in the sign of the end is this says is this the time listen somebody stay around I love that say amen he says that some of the Mysteries that this angel is supposed to up at the opening of The Seven Seals the mystery all the mysteries of God and the other may I say this with reverence I'm not referring to myself but referring to the of God the Ser [Music] seed been hidden all through the the straightened [Music] out not this but real true amen not such a thing as an eternal burning all these Mysteries and then he comes to paragraph 26 and he says the [Music] mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without a sensation now people they take all the other mystery which is revealed in the Seven Seals but when they come to this one they rejected they still want some emotion they still want to shout a young doctor told me I agree with what you've told but why don't you teach the evidence I don't teach the evidence because whatever you teach the people there will be a spirit to impersonate when they went to the Upp room they didn't go to receive the evidence they went to receive the person let the person when he comes do what he wants to do when I tell you you jump to do that you see what I mean because the you know teaching faith is touching Dimensions so as a teacher you don't teach evidence you teach the B of the holy spirit in the hour that we are living so before opening the seals he Tau in the light of the past age are you together with me there are certain things he told that the human spirit is the one that is at the center but then he says no after the light is come he says it's the Soul at one time he told that Christ was I mean Christ was the White House Rider but when the word comes he says no it's the Antichrist at one time he don't love being the evidence of the B of the Holy Ghost and so many other things he kept changing it's true that he talked about those emotions but under what period of his ministry are you understanding me because if we do that then it's like a Paul healing the Le and telling them go and show yourself to the priest you understand me this morning amen praise the Lord so we don't dispute the need of the B of the ho ghost it is very important but we cannot emphasize and we tell people when he comes you do this when let him come let him do what he wants to do amen so the past age the emphasis was on turn and emotions which has not ceased but should be I mean should not Beed as the evidence according to brother BR amen secondly you cannot disassociate the Bas of the Holy Ghost without Sensation from being one of the Mysteries amen let me say it properly you cannot disass of the ho ghost and you separate it from the truth that it comes without a sensation he says one of the Mysteries that was revealed so I'll show you something here Pastor dealt a lot with it but let me bring it here too he says I know it's a great temptation to refer back to the day of Pentecost and also to the day when the Holy Ghost fell on the house of Cornelius and then set those two identical experiences as the evidence of the BS of the Holy Ghost he says it is a great temptation to go back to the Pentecost and what happened in the house of and then what happened when the Holy Ghost came it's a great Temptation for people and they end up calling it the evidence that's not me that's your message amen but on each occasion the tongues were understood by the listeners this is a far cry from the B bubble of confusion of the Pentecostal meetings now you can begin to see why T is not the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost it doesn't say any age he that has the tongue let him say what the spe is saying that puts T interpretation thereof and prophecy aside as the evidence the evidence is hearing what the spirit says hallelujah hallelujah the spirit is talking yes the spirit is teaching this is exactly what Jesus says he will do when he comes hallelujah hallelujah when he comes he'll teach you that's the evidence praise God you hear the word you receive the word you perform the word that's the evidence amen do you shout also yes but that's not the evidence do you dance yes but that's not the can you speak in Tong yes but that's not praise the Lord amen yes sir you heard the pastor teach [Music] amen he that more will be given have what he that has a seed gen he that has an in hallelujah hallelujah he has the ability to receive from the ho the Holy Ghost will keep giving him amen John 14:26 he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you and that it is just what happened that is how the gospel were written these men had recalled to their [Music] minds by the Holy Ghost the very words that Jesus SP that's why the gospels are accurate amen praise God they had and they were reminded hallelujah hallelujah and when you come here by the Holy Ghost here the Holy Ghost to us and at the right time the Holy Ghost will bring back these things to you amen praise God yes sir there's a brother from the state he sent me a message this morning from thean church that a person who says he knows god without the word is St because the word is the seed so what are you going to S praise God so they are perfect but the spirit did not only bring all things to their minds but he taught them further on the truth they already had that's how Paul received his Revelations amen and then we come down here to the Lan church he says then there's all this talk about it is supposed to be the evidence of the BM of the Holy Ghost people are thinking that we're in the midst of a great Revival the Revival is over America had chance in 1957 so now the tong are God's sign of impending disaster even as they were then they appeared upon the wall at bel's Feast talking Tong good it's but not the evidence and whenever TKS came it was not prophesying Revival it always spoke about disaster at the wall in Babylon [Laughter] you have been put in a balance and you you have been made amen and then he was thrown out of the Kingdom on the day of Pentecost the Jews spoke in Tong they lost the gospel the Gentiles took it the Gentiles are speaking they lose it the Jews will take it it's a prophetic sign amen so let's talk now about the need of the B of the Holy Spirit when we say of the B of the Holy Ghost without Sensation that people think we don't believe in the B of the Holy because they think the Holy Spirit can only come by why do they have to tell people what they should do when he comes and whatever they are taught is what they do if he's jumping they jump he has a guy had a man he rode down here he threw all his legs all over the place and all the mucus was coming out he was not caring to clean up because because the new birth is a mess so he was proving he was having a mess after that service he came to me and he says Pastor God says it's very pleased with you you have done a great work in this town but he wants to retire you and I'm going to become the pastor and God has said that you don't only take a TI we shall be giving you 40% and then will go to the P so we've been through all this we want you to stabilize in the word you see it's too bad to go so far then you discover you are disappointed I will not say that one now just look at one thing your election and not what the Holy Ghost does in the process of filling me with the holy spirit because the promise is yours the holy spirit is the elect hallelujah hallelujah so first you have to look at Redemption the work of the Holy Ghost one thing the moment you feel that something has worked in your life and caus you to change against your past life that is justification and that's already the work of the Holy Ghost amen when the holy God keeps you in studying the wording itting your that's a work of the Holy Ghost that is sanctification amen and then you must so remember like you could not justify yourself yourself you cannot baptize yourself with the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost the gift of God to you and you must take it by faith amen the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is a process that God starts in our lives by justification say just like making a vehicle the manufacturer makes the mechanics first before he could move to its Dynamics but yet the creator of the mechanics is the same one that gives the Dynamics hallelujah hallelujah the Lord who pulled you from that cigarette the brought you from the prostitution house is the same God willing to baptize you with the amen so if he did the first step keep thanking him amen justification and sanctification and God putting the mechanics of your Christian Life right that when the Holy Ghost comes he meets when you are a stable car hallelujah hallelujah amen you see those cars there amen the mechanics must be right the car must have the wheels amen but if you standing on something else you go and put the Dynamics it will start out it will not go anywhere because the mechanics are not right praise God Amen that's why brother Bram obedience to the word the it will become automatic amen praise God God's provided place of worship brother Bram says now we find out that come into God's provided way with his word and walked 500 years and pleased him and we find out that the mechanics were set so perfect in him that when the Dynamics got to working in the engine it just took him off the Earth hallelujah hallelujah what was necessary it was putting the mechanics right to put the word in your life that's the thing that you should be concerned with so in the Min of the word God is fixing your mechanics he's pieing together your attitude and creating the desire in your life to receive the bom of the Holy Ghost so it is not three works but one work has it started yes he has started on you because you are here this morning you are here because you are just F here to be Sanctified one work so he started on the process every morning you wake up to thank God because he promised to fill you the the amen praise God he says now then there was justification sanctification the B of the Holy Ghost not three different [Music] dispensations three works of Grace but one work in three different manifestations same holy spirit with lu hallelujah hallelujah under justification was under wle with sanctification in the church now in the B of the Holy Ghost the same Holy Spirit not to Holy Spirit the same Holy Spirit are you together with me he was there with but in our understanding we said this is the age of the Holy Spirit it has always been the edge of the Holy SP amen so do you see where I'm coming from it's a growing life you just have to set your understanding right that's all you need your problem as far as the B of the Holy Ghost is conern is just your attitude when you think wrong you don't have it when you think right you'll have amen let's go to acts 18 verse 24 and verse 25 I want you to see how easy it is for you to receive the bom of the Holy very easy you were here because you are [Music] candidate for the BM of the holy spirit amen so acts 18:24 and a certain Jew named Apollos born Alexandri an El man might in the scriptures came to this man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fent in spirit he SP and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the B of John that's where the problem was he had everything he needed for the B of the Holy Ghost but because he understood the BM of John ra he could not receive the BM they already had the qualities that Reed the Holy Ghost they were Believers of the word but their problem was in verse 25 they were not aware of the promise amen they were not aware that's what you need you need to understand that the promise is yours and you need to have faith that the promise is yours all this works by the hearing of Faith because the hearing of faith is what brings down the B of the Holy Ghost your life Galatians 3 the Galatians they had received the bom of the Holy Spirit but they wanted to mix it with the law and it hurt the holy spirit so the holy ho Spirit rebukes them in Galatians chapter 3 verse one he says oh foolish Galatians who has Bewitched you that you should obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you amen this only would I learn of you received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith praise the Lord he's asking them how did you receive the Holy Ghost he says you receive the Holy Ghost by the hearing of Faith so in Roman paa this hearing of Faith The Obedience of faith and brother Bram in the token messages he calls it fully obedient so do you have the full obedience then you are candidate for the bom of the Holy Ghost so that makes the word the Al and the Omega the hearing of faiths in the B of the Holy Ghost and the evidence is that you stay in the word and you manifest it okay John 16 I'm finishing in the next 15 minutes or he says how about when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you in all truth that's how we know me 163 13 rather 1 not three but 13 amen he will guide you in all truth not only speak perform SS have emotions but he guides you in all truth there's no greater evidence laid down in scripture the evidence is believing and being guided in what you believe leing the life of the world so the Holy Ghost teaches the message of the to the believer and causes that believer to Bear the fruit of that one and the evidence will never change somebody here say Amen the evidence never changes in thean ch brother Bram says in every age the evidence was the same hallelujah hallelujah the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher had the word and the spirit in them took the word and T it to them and they were of the group that had the messenger and this message and took it and lived it and says that's the evidence and he says it you never change the evidence you come to the knowledge of the world you take it and you leave the instruction of the word are you together with me yeah so I don't want you to start getting so troubled are you a believer in the word amen does the word work life in you that's what the evidence is supposed the evidence is not your good work but the evidence is hearing the word manifesting the fruit of that word so the fruit is greater than your works the fruit is the work of the Holy Ghost in your amen not your labor oh God help me so so that I can some I think who even beat their own mouth don't beat the mouth open the Avenue for the Holy Ghost when he comes you will bear the fruit of the am praise God yes sir so let me finish up here with what we need so stimulation of Revelation the emotions amen jump it's very good I like it if the word has come your way say Amen you say a very healthy one amen you see you don't have to leave your seat and you run through the to come and just stay where you are and send the you reach praise the Lord if you're happy you clap your heart you lift up your heart that's okay but the problem is the people to mix that amen as the B of the Holy Spirit are you together with me the B of the Holy Ghost is different it's the person of the Lord coming in living in your life by the word and manifest his presence by your fruit amen and when the word is in you the man teaches like I am doing and it comes right to back to your your your your soul here that's what I was seeing every day amen and you bring a good one that hallelujah it's okay praise God you know we call it stimulation that comes after Revelation sometimes you get something and you don't even say you just get astounded and you you you you shake your head wonder how is this God you see you remember when I spoke about the B and the pastor preaches emotion is okay anything without emotion is dead but the emotion that doesn't have biic order people had G to coming with trumpets in church some others with whle we come to church to hear the word but if something is [Music] done totally to take away the hearing of the word there is something wrong [Applause] blowing trumpets I can blow it at home the whistles I can blow at are you together with but then you come to church and then one sister comes to the front and then then another one then another one is f before the word is out of the preachers m now what are you here for wait [Applause] first are you together with me and let me tell you the bodies of our sisters are so that you be careful to what levels you discr that body let him understand stimulation of Revelation goes with Sensations when the word challenges your human Spirit the body May re when you're reasoning when you're reasoning and affections are challenged you can react with emotions amen if you used to be in the wrong way and something is say to challenge that wrong way amen human spirit will react and then you'll say Lord I'm are you together with me yes sir and that's why brother Bram says of the people come to the altar they overwhelmed by the emotion of sanctification and they cry out and they call it the Holy Ghost so when you're reason and affections are challenged you can say Amen if the word goes to the soul and promotes or lifts higher your understanding of something not St Amen brother Bram says in the St of a perfect man now a lot of people go up to the Altar and pray and say forgive me the great experience of sanctification come upon them then you have a great time get up to the altar shouting you go back and say bless God I got it no you just started to a place yeah you can grow you hav done nothing yet the only thing you done is just let the foundation amen that is sanctification you overwhelmed by the life there something wrong in your life you cry out the altar all right don't call that the baptism some of those things that's the human spirit being exposed it may cause some emotions amen yes sir and when Revelation hits the soul it moves to reset the human spirit this causes emotional reaction you can cry you can Rejoice the wife it I never heard it before that's okay have your Liberty if you want to cry cry if you want to laugh are you together with me yeah but don't say because you did that that was the Holy Ghost don't connect that to the baptism of the Holy Spirit and when you do it the spirit of a prophet is subject to Prophets [Music] don't that spirit is overwhelming me and they came and even F in the platform a little bit of teaching this morning listen to what brother Bram says that's what I think about a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost [Music] meeting when I can hear a good old amen oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah somebody JP up and scream and cry a little bit I know that's shining somewhere just kind of gives you just a real good feeling of that but do it in moderation nobody should say iner you don't say in ginger you don't Rejoice you don't cry we do uhuh and it's one praise the Lord so we must separate stimulation of Revelation amen and also the Bas of the Holy Ghost amen though things may be real but they are neither the B itself evidence but it's the return amen of the joy of Salvation making you rejoice and on the third seal of your life you need to protect the whe amen and the amen when the word Falls in there amen the word amen the word and when the wi gets right there amen praise God so that you may show you are still alive amen we are not saying you come I'm not saying you come and mess up the service stand where you are and send the amen it gets over to God and he receives it amen do you love him amen I remind you one thing that Faith deals with Dimensions you bring it wrong he takes the people the wrong way you bring it right the Holy Spirit himself brings the reaction postively that has been preached God bless you amen God bless [Applause] you I would love to see a church that has the confidence that you are not swung Left Right wind of doctr you know where you stand God bless you God bless [Applause] you let's get on our feet are you
