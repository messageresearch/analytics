[1:00:12] it amen let's just stand up and get into
[1:00:15] the scripture
[1:00:17] reading we don't have enough time
[1:00:22] today not enough time in the
[1:00:24] morning are not even enough time in the
[1:00:29] evening God bless you
[1:00:32] brother amen for accepting to be here
[1:00:35] with us this
[1:00:37] morning amen so we shall go into First
[1:00:42] Corinthians chapter
[1:00:45] 11 and verse
[1:00:47] 7 for a man indeed ought not to cover
[1:00:52] his
[1:00:54] head
[1:00:56] for as much as he is the image and glory
[1:00:59] of
[1:01:02] God but the
[1:01:04] woman is the glory of the
[1:01:09] man may the Lord had blessing the
[1:01:11] reading of his
[1:01:13] word you may be
[1:01:16] seated so I have a subject
[1:01:20] today she is the glory of the
[1:01:24] husband amen
[1:01:26] so any married sisters
[1:01:29] here you add the glory of your
[1:01:33] husband and this is what I want to
[1:01:36] emphasize this
[1:01:38] morning and I want to take you know from
[1:01:44] Genesis so that we can systematically go
[1:01:48] with this
[1:01:50] thought amen we know very well that life
[1:01:55] began in
[1:01:57] life amen because he is the life
[1:02:01] himself he existed
[1:02:04] alone when there was nothing like an
[1:02:08] angel there were no atoms there was no
[1:02:13] gas but he existed by
[1:02:17] himself the self existent
[1:02:21] one and the Hebrews called him
[1:02:24] Elohim El Elohim means the one who
[1:02:29] exists by
[1:02:31] himself then that invisible
[1:02:35] Spirit took a the
[1:02:38] body called the
[1:02:40] logos the word
[1:02:42] body that way he was stepping into
[1:02:46] form because asoh him he did not have
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:50] form he was an invisible
[1:02:53] spirit that existed by
[1:02:56] himself there was nobody who would look
[1:02:59] into who he
[1:03:02] was so he existed without a
[1:03:06] form but then he took a form of a
[1:03:10] body and this form here was a form of a
[1:03:15] light a body of
[1:03:17] light but then he retained the same
[1:03:21] power the same glory and the same
[1:03:24] Authority
[1:03:26] so he just proceeded from
[1:03:30] invisibility to a body of light called
[1:03:32] the
[1:03:34] logos and that's the same body that Saul
[1:03:41] met when he was on his way to
[1:03:44] Damascus to continue persecuting the
[1:03:48] Christians there is something that
[1:03:50] brother Bram says
[1:03:52] here he says and in the evening when the
[1:03:56] sun was going
[1:03:59] down and they went to the cathedral
[1:04:02] under the palm
[1:04:07] trees whatever trees it was in
[1:04:11] Eden and they began to
[1:04:14] worship and a soft M
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:19] light God the logos came
[1:04:23] down over the top of the trees
[1:04:26] and he said
[1:04:28] children have you enjoyed yourself
[1:04:31] today on the earth God was coming down
[1:04:36] to Adam and
[1:04:37] Eve as a soft glowing
[1:04:41] light and then he would speak to them
[1:04:44] about how they spent the
[1:04:47] day did you enjoy the day and then they
[1:04:50] would say yes we had a very wonderful
[1:04:53] day we went down into the
[1:04:57] we had sought out that
[1:04:59] mountain we brought this Mountain from
[1:05:02] here to
[1:05:03] there you see we just organized the
[1:05:06] Earth according to the way it would
[1:05:08] really be nice for
[1:05:11] us because he was an
[1:05:14] God God had given him a
[1:05:16] kingdom where he could exercise God's
[1:05:19] Authority on
[1:05:22] us and then God would say ni
[1:05:26] okay have a good night that was God and
[1:05:30] man so God if we can see it this
[1:05:35] way he formed himself into Supernatural
[1:05:40] [Applause]
[1:05:42] light and then spoke a natural
[1:05:47] light let there be
[1:05:51] light he had formed himself a body of
[1:05:55] life
[1:05:57] a
[1:05:59] supernatural and in that body he said
[1:06:02] let there be
[1:06:03] life and when John speaks about him as
[1:06:08] light he calls him the True
[1:06:12] Light which means is
[1:06:15] different from this solar
[1:06:18] light the lunar
[1:06:20] light the natural light is totally
[1:06:24] different from those light
[1:06:26] therefore he calls him a True
[1:06:29] Light he such a
[1:06:31] light that when he steps into the
[1:06:34] natural
[1:06:35] light the natural light turns into
[1:06:40] darkness because that's what
[1:06:43] happens when Saul was on his way to
[1:06:47] Damascus when that great
[1:06:50] light the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:54] Christ came down to meet
[1:06:56] sa this natural
[1:06:59] light which you know sa would use to
[1:07:03] see it became
[1:07:06] Darkness oh praise the Lord so in the
[1:07:11] beginning Elohim stepped into that
[1:07:14] Supernatural body of
[1:07:18] life and he started to
[1:07:21] create he created the
[1:07:24] vegetation he created the sea
[1:07:26] life he created the birs of the
[1:07:29] air he created the animals of the
[1:07:33] field and finally created Man In His
[1:07:39] Image man was the Capstone of his
[1:07:45] creation but I want you to see what the
[1:07:48] Bible says about that
[1:07:51] man in Genesis chter 5 and verse one he
[1:07:57] says this is the
[1:07:59] book of the generations of
[1:08:02] Adam in the day that God created
[1:08:07] man in the likeness of
[1:08:10] God him now what was the likeness of
[1:08:16] God God was a great
[1:08:18] light
[1:08:20] Supernatural and God created Adam in the
[1:08:24] same image
[1:08:26] then he says in verse
[1:08:28] two male and
[1:08:30] female created he them and blessed them
[1:08:35] and called their name
[1:08:38] Adam in the day when he when they were
[1:08:43] created so
[1:08:45] Man created in the image of
[1:08:49] God and the likeness of
[1:08:52] God Amen so that you know there was a
[1:08:57] mystery in this
[1:08:59] man and the
[1:09:01] Mystery was that there was a woman on
[1:09:05] the side of
[1:09:07] it are you together with me so what does
[1:09:10] that
[1:09:11] mean it means that since
[1:09:15] God created man in his own image and
[1:09:20] therefore man had a mystery bride in him
[1:09:27] even God from before the foundation of
[1:09:30] the world he had a bride in him is that
[1:09:35] amen yeah he didn't find me
[1:09:38] now I was in him before the foundation
[1:09:42] of the
[1:09:42] world and when he created Adam he was
[1:09:48] representing the
[1:09:50] idea of what he was and the Bible says
[1:09:55] when he created I mean male and
[1:09:58] female he cre he called their name
[1:10:02] Adam meaning that a
[1:10:05] bride shares in the
[1:10:09] name of the
[1:10:12] man are you together with me he called
[1:10:16] their
[1:10:18] name meaning that she shares of his
[1:10:24] name
[1:10:25] meaning that she is part of
[1:10:29] him and the name means the
[1:10:34] character are you together with me that
[1:10:37] when Eve would proceed from
[1:10:42] Adam then that thing would be
[1:10:45] seen except the nature of
[1:10:49] Adam in this
[1:10:53] woman are you together with me
[1:10:56] so now let us
[1:10:58] say we also
[1:11:00] share in the
[1:11:02] likeness of the nature of
[1:11:05] God so Adam could not
[1:11:10] function to his full function I mean to
[1:11:13] to the
[1:11:14] fullness when Eve was not made
[1:11:20] manifest there was something
[1:11:23] there that needed to be made
[1:11:28] manifest so that Adam could fully
[1:11:33] function are you together with me yes
[1:11:37] sir now a real Christian
[1:11:40] man cannot really
[1:11:44] Excel to his
[1:11:47] limits unless something special
[1:11:51] happens that he finds a help meat
[1:11:58] are you together with me Adam could not
[1:12:02] function to his
[1:12:04] fullness there are certain things he
[1:12:06] could not
[1:12:08] do until this woman was made
[1:12:13] manifest because she comes to
[1:12:17] manifestation to become a help
[1:12:21] me Amen to become somebody to support
[1:12:24] him
[1:12:25] [Applause]
[1:12:26] so there are certain
[1:12:28] limits that Adam could not attain
[1:12:32] to are you together with me I want to
[1:12:35] tell you men that there are certain
[1:12:39] limits that you cannot attend to without
[1:12:43] your wife there are certain things that
[1:12:47] your wife is supposed to help you
[1:12:51] out
[1:12:53] amen so the process of
[1:12:57] marriage was made like a work of
[1:13:02] art that could hang in the Hall of
[1:13:07] critics to be
[1:13:09] criticized to be
[1:13:11] proved before it could be hang out in
[1:13:14] the Hall of
[1:13:15] [Applause]
[1:13:18] Faith amen praise the Lord now let me
[1:13:22] say this it's like those people
[1:13:25] who make a
[1:13:27] craft on the streets they put this you
[1:13:32] know uh
[1:13:34] craft so that they can criticize
[1:13:38] it this head is
[1:13:40] Big let me trim it this hand here is not
[1:13:45] proportional to the
[1:13:47] body let me do this amen and marriage
[1:13:52] the we
[1:13:53] came it was like a
[1:13:56] god
[1:13:58] allowed this
[1:14:00] process to be taken in a hall of
[1:14:06] critics so that it can be
[1:14:09] proved before it could be
[1:14:11] brought before
[1:14:17] realization
[1:14:19] God had to watch
[1:14:22] Adam and then he sees Adam
[1:14:26] he says there are certain limits he
[1:14:27] cannot attain
[1:14:30] to I want to tell the young man here
[1:14:34] that there are certain I mean Heights
[1:14:37] you cannot attain
[1:14:40] to unless you are
[1:14:45] married you cannot reproduce
[1:14:48] yourself unless you are
[1:14:52] married you cannot practice fatherhood
[1:14:57] without a marriage there are certain
[1:15:00] Heights you cannot
[1:15:03] attain so God put Adam
[1:15:06] there so that he can develop a
[1:15:12] mind and then God would prove
[1:15:15] him and then he says it's not
[1:15:18] good for a man to stay
[1:15:23] alone Amen brother
[1:15:27] it's not good for a
[1:15:29] man to stay alone amen So Adam had to
[1:15:34] prove that he had developed his
[1:15:38] mind and therefore God would allow the
[1:15:42] mystery of the
[1:15:44] Bride to be made
[1:15:47] manifest amen so marriage
[1:15:51] therefore
[1:15:53] exposes and
[1:15:57] our levels of
[1:15:59] maturity because a mature
[1:16:02] man is known by the way he relates to
[1:16:06] his
[1:16:10] wife that's very important
[1:16:13] there marriage will
[1:16:17] expose the love of your
[1:16:20] thinking it will
[1:16:22] expose the love of your Administration
[1:16:27] Expos the of your
[1:16:31] patience and that's why the
[1:16:34] Bible attaches to the
[1:16:37] ministry attaches the
[1:16:39] ministry to the success of a man's
[1:16:48] marriage because this man by way of
[1:16:53] marriage the of his
[1:16:56] PES by his marriage he's expressing the
[1:17:01] way of his
[1:17:02] Thinking by his marriage he's expressing
[1:17:06] the ability of
[1:17:09] management of a
[1:17:14] community and that's why the
[1:17:17] Bible attaches the
[1:17:20] ministry to the success of the man is
[1:17:24] marriage
[1:17:28] let's go to First Timothy chter
[1:17:31] 3 and
[1:17:33] verse he says a bishop V must be
[1:17:41] blameless the husband of one
[1:17:47] wife sober of good
[1:17:51] behavior given to hospitality and a to
[1:18:00] teach not given to Wine no Striker not g
[1:18:05] of fer but
[1:18:13] patient not a
[1:18:20] not one that ruleth well his house
[1:18:24] having his children
[1:18:25] in subjection with all
[1:18:32] gravity for if a man know not how true
[1:18:37] his how shall he take care of the Church
[1:18:41] of
[1:18:44] God there are certain things you cannot
[1:18:47] attend to unless you are
[1:18:53] married so the points to Mark
[1:18:57] here a bishop must be married to one
[1:19:03] wife he rules this family
[1:19:08] well by the
[1:19:11] word not by what he
[1:19:14] thinks but by the
[1:19:16] word having
[1:19:19] children in
[1:19:21] subjection then for one to pass the test
[1:19:24] of the
[1:19:27] Bishop one must be seen living with his
[1:19:31] wife as one
[1:19:38] body you see there are many people who
[1:19:41] love their
[1:19:41] [Music]
[1:19:43] bodies they'll wash
[1:19:46] them they'll care for
[1:19:48] them they eat very
[1:19:53] well
[1:20:00] you see what I mean they love their body
[1:20:04] you cannot separate from their
[1:20:08] body some of these
[1:20:10] people go to some kind of a
[1:20:14] shop and he look at every
[1:20:18] suit because he loves his
[1:20:21] body he'll get the best suit because he
[1:20:25] loves his body he looks at the color of
[1:20:28] his
[1:20:29] skin and then the color of the
[1:20:32] suit it takes about an
[1:20:34] hour to choose the right
[1:20:37] one do you know why because he
[1:20:41] loves his
[1:20:44] body you see what I mean so a
[1:20:48] bishop a pastor must be a man who knows
[1:20:54] how to dwell
[1:20:55] with his wife as one
[1:20:59] body are you together with me loves it
[1:21:02] nourishes
[1:21:04] it amen and then he comes down here in
[1:21:07] first Timothy
[1:21:10] 310 and let those also first be
[1:21:15] proved then let them use the office of a
[1:21:19] deacon being found
[1:21:23] blameless
[1:21:27] amen Deon is now here even so must their
[1:21:31] wives be
[1:21:37] great not
[1:21:41] slanderers faithful in all
[1:21:45] th let the deons be the husbands of one
[1:21:51] wife ruling their children and their own
[1:21:54] house as
[1:21:57] well no I'm saying that there are
[1:22:00] certain areas of
[1:22:03] life a man cannot attend
[1:22:07] to because the only way he can get to
[1:22:11] them as if he has been tested in the
[1:22:13] field of his
[1:22:19] marriage that's why a
[1:22:21] bishop meaning a pastor cannot be a
[1:22:27] woman because the Bible says must be a
[1:22:31] man of one wife there cannot be a
[1:22:36] deacon because even a
[1:22:38] deacon must be a husband of one
[1:22:41] wife and also
[1:22:44] tested before he set out to
[1:22:46] work so all these scriptures show that a
[1:22:51] wife is a very strong determinant
[1:22:57] in accessing a church
[1:23:03] off because your marriage will expose
[1:23:07] your levels of
[1:23:10] maturity if you married for
[1:23:14] convenience it will be
[1:23:17] exposed if you Mar a wife for a cook in
[1:23:20] the
[1:23:22] house it will be exposed
[1:23:25] but if you married a
[1:23:27] wife because you want to take the type
[1:23:30] of Christ and the
[1:23:32] church it will also be
[1:23:36] exposed
[1:23:37] amen hallelujah hallelujah so marriage
[1:23:41] exposes your levels of
[1:23:45] respect Amen to see how you respect your
[1:23:49] wife to see whether you
[1:23:52] pass to become a person who will be able
[1:23:56] to respect the
[1:23:58] church if you became a
[1:24:01] pastor you she a training
[1:24:05] ground marriage exposes your level of
[1:24:10] patience amen and CED with the
[1:24:14] children we shall see the level of your
[1:24:20] administration of the
[1:24:23] community
[1:24:27] so in First Peter 3 verse
[1:24:32] 1 listen to what Peter says
[1:24:36] here likewise you
[1:24:40] wi be in subjection to your own
[1:24:45] husband now the Bible doesn't
[1:24:49] say be in subjection to all
[1:24:53] men no he says be in subjection to your
[1:24:59] own
[1:25:04] husband you don't go to a man's
[1:25:07] house is uh her husband is not
[1:25:11] there and then you say she didn't cook
[1:25:14] for me a cup of
[1:25:19] tea
[1:25:22] women be in subjection to your own
[1:25:27] husband that if any obey not the
[1:25:31] word they also May without the word be
[1:25:35] one by the conversation of their
[1:25:41] wives so now wives are called to
[1:25:47] subjection so a wife should not compete
[1:25:52] for the headship of the home
[1:25:56] because that position is not
[1:26:00] H that position is given to the
[1:26:03] man but the
[1:26:06] men having that
[1:26:08] position should not abuse their
[1:26:13] leadership because your
[1:26:16] headship is channeled through one
[1:26:19] channel and that's the channel of
[1:26:23] love
[1:26:26] are you together with me your headship
[1:26:29] works by
[1:26:31] love if you tell me there is a family
[1:26:35] violence in this
[1:26:37] house we are given only two
[1:26:40] things we are given love and
[1:26:44] submission there is no woman that will
[1:26:47] hurt you for loving
[1:26:53] her
[1:26:56] I loved my wife so much until she hated
[1:26:58] me there must be something
[1:27:04] else are you together with
[1:27:07] me
[1:27:09] love and
[1:27:11] submission so what do the sister submit
[1:27:16] to the sister submits to your
[1:27:22] love the more you love her is the more
[1:27:26] she's going to
[1:27:29] subit sisters are you
[1:27:33] there amen so in verse
[1:27:37] seven he
[1:27:39] says likewise ye
[1:27:43] husbands dwell with them according to
[1:27:49] knowledge meaning that the first
[1:27:53] time
[1:27:55] God allowed Adam to have a
[1:27:58] wife he had to test his level of
[1:28:02] understanding
[1:28:05] first then he says it's not
[1:28:08] good such a man to alone because he has
[1:28:13] passed the
[1:28:15] test he has the mind of
[1:28:18] God to dwell with a wife with
[1:28:23] understanding
[1:28:27] it's not just keep them in the house but
[1:28:30] dwell with them according to
[1:28:33] knowledge giving honor unto the
[1:28:38] wife as unto the
[1:28:41] we as a man you are
[1:28:45] mular you got big
[1:28:48] Muses but she's a weaker
[1:28:51] vess you got a muline spirit
[1:28:55] but she's got a tender feminine
[1:28:59] Spirit you cannot dwell with your
[1:29:02] wife like you are dwelling with a man in
[1:29:05] your
[1:29:06] house the Bible says You must
[1:29:10] realize she's a weaker
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:16] vess and while you are dealing with in
[1:29:19] the
[1:29:20] house you must know that both of you you
[1:29:25] are ha to the grace of
[1:29:30] life so as far as God is
[1:29:34] concerned he has put two children
[1:29:37] together saved by the same
[1:29:40] Grace talking to the same God In
[1:29:44] Prayer but this one here is looking to
[1:29:48] you to love her because it began from
[1:29:53] you will you marry
[1:29:57] me didn't we hear the song It Started
[1:30:01] from you so you must keep that
[1:30:05] standard love
[1:30:11] her thank
[1:30:13] you she's a tender timid
[1:30:20] spirit and must be handled as so
[1:30:24] and once you Hur her
[1:30:28] confidence sometimes it's very hard to
[1:30:30] repair
[1:30:35] it you see when my daughter just
[1:30:40] married I went to visit
[1:30:43] them and then you know I found her
[1:30:48] alone in the
[1:30:50] house and I told her you leave our
[1:30:56] country and you go to this far
[1:30:59] country to a man whom you don't
[1:31:04] know and she
[1:31:07] said it was a
[1:31:10] revelation she loves
[1:31:14] you she has trusted her life to
[1:31:18] you you must treat that life
[1:31:22] right they called little
[1:31:25] Rea and they said Becca will you go with
[1:31:29] this
[1:31:32] man and she says I will
[1:31:35] go her mind was way out for
[1:31:40] Isaac they made a
[1:31:42] party and poor girl
[1:31:45] went where was she going she was going
[1:31:49] to a
[1:31:50] kingdom she was going to meet her
[1:31:52] husband the woman sells you all her
[1:31:59] trust you need to love
[1:32:07] them so in verse eight he say finally be
[1:32:12] all of One
[1:32:15] mind having compassion one of
[1:32:21] another love as brethren
[1:32:25] be
[1:32:26] pitiful be
[1:32:30] cous those are things that you must make
[1:32:33] sure you exercise in your
[1:32:37] house to be of one
[1:32:41] mind to have compassion one for
[1:32:45] another so seek to be of the same mind
[1:32:49] with your
[1:32:51] wife because basically you are one
[1:32:56] body and going back to the
[1:33:00] beginning your wife was your
[1:33:06] Revelation are you together with me
[1:33:09] because here is
[1:33:11] Adam he has been put to
[1:33:14] sleep and now you know a re is
[1:33:19] moved and the wife is
[1:33:22] M when he comes out of
[1:33:24] sleep he sees this woman
[1:33:28] here and he says hey you are Flesh of My
[1:33:33] Flesh you are born of my
[1:33:36] born you shall be called
[1:33:39] woman because you came out of the M who
[1:33:43] told Adam it was his Revelation who told
[1:33:47] you to marry
[1:33:48] that your
[1:33:50] own you must love
[1:33:54] [Applause]
[1:33:57] amen amen amen then he says not
[1:34:00] rendering evil for
[1:34:02] evil you are not a man when you say I
[1:34:06] beat her because she did this no the
[1:34:10] Bible says not rendering evil for
[1:34:15] evil or rendering I mean raing for
[1:34:22] raing
[1:34:29] amen knowing that you are there that you
[1:34:34] should inherit a
[1:34:38] blessing amen so a marriage
[1:34:43] relationship must be
[1:34:46] free of
[1:34:50] Revenge I'm I'm I'm waiting for for
[1:34:54] her when she does this I'll do it to her
[1:34:58] also and when she says this I say don't
[1:35:02] you
[1:35:03] remember you are not a
[1:35:08] man you are not a
[1:35:11] man because we are talking about husband
[1:35:14] and
[1:35:15] wife and I want you to look at Christ
[1:35:18] and his
[1:35:20] church you mishandle her
[1:35:28] Christ he says for he that will love
[1:35:36] life and see good
[1:35:40] days let him refrain from
[1:35:45] Evil and his lips that they speak in or
[1:35:50] G so here the the the Bible
[1:35:54] is teaching family
[1:35:57] order by giving the
[1:36:00] husband and the wife
[1:36:05] guidelines when you come to
[1:36:08] church you subject to a church
[1:36:12] order when you get
[1:36:14] married you subject yourself to family
[1:36:20] order that you must not break
[1:36:25] don't be bitter to one
[1:36:29] another and as a Son of God cannot fail
[1:36:33] to keep his wife
[1:36:36] happy regardless of what challenges they
[1:36:39] are going
[1:36:41] through you have got the ability to keep
[1:36:43] your wife
[1:36:49] up let me show you something here you
[1:36:52] know some people
[1:36:59] ISB when get M Bey if you are not able
[1:37:03] to be
[1:37:04] happy with your wife and your husband in
[1:37:09] time of poverty even when you get the
[1:37:12] money that joy and peace will not be
[1:37:15] there and it even become
[1:37:22] worse I'll give you you an example in
[1:37:25] the message choosing a
[1:37:28] bride brother Bram brings before us two
[1:37:32] couples the rich and the poor and he
[1:37:37] wedlocked both of them so he goes back
[1:37:41] to check on
[1:37:44] them okay so and then one day he says I
[1:37:48] thought I would go down and visit this
[1:37:51] Rich
[1:37:52] couple
[1:37:56] and then he tells us something about
[1:37:59] them he says that they don't have to
[1:38:03] work their fathers were
[1:38:07] millionaires had had given them a nice
[1:38:10] home they didn't have to work they had a
[1:38:14] nice
[1:38:17] CAD which was given to them every year
[1:38:19] they were given a new
[1:38:22] CAD
[1:38:24] and only children and they had just
[1:38:26] everything they
[1:38:29] wanted and I went there got their little
[1:38:34] clothes and I had them and they were
[1:38:37] really
[1:38:41] fasing
[1:38:43] rich they don't have to
[1:38:45] work wake up in the morning make these
[1:38:49] eggs and
[1:38:51] sausage and then ride in the their CAD
[1:38:54] brand
[1:38:56] new driven for 12 months they given
[1:38:59] another
[1:39:01] one but they were jealousy of one
[1:39:06] another they had gone to a
[1:39:09] dance and you know this girl was really
[1:39:14] beautiful and she was kind of those
[1:39:16] beauty
[1:39:18] queen I'm telling the young man
[1:39:21] now marriage is not
[1:39:27] [Applause]
[1:39:29] praise the Lord and I looked at them and
[1:39:33] one was sitting in one corner the other
[1:39:36] was SE in the other Corner fing about a
[1:39:39] certain
[1:39:43] boy and the cring of another
[1:39:47] girl because they had been in at night
[1:39:50] club and this boy danc with the girl and
[1:39:53] this
[1:39:53] man danced with you know and so they
[1:39:55] were
[1:39:58] fasty so then I went
[1:40:01] slowly and as he got into the
[1:40:04] house they jumped to one another oh
[1:40:08] brother BR how are you doing it's nice
[1:40:12] to see you
[1:40:17] here hiding their
[1:40:21] situations I'm a pastor
[1:40:24] I know how to read
[1:40:26] people you get to a home and you know
[1:40:30] where there's true
[1:40:40] love you
[1:40:42] see if I get to a
[1:40:45] home and the man is saying
[1:40:48] something has to look to the wife to
[1:40:52] affirm
[1:40:59] but if there's true
[1:41:01] love the man does not have to say you
[1:41:04] must say
[1:41:12] yes you know you get to the house there
[1:41:16] and you can see whether is a genuine
[1:41:21] smile whether the smile is
[1:41:29] fake you see what I mean
[1:41:33] yeah I'm a pastor I read
[1:41:36] people you get into a house and the
[1:41:40] conversation
[1:41:41] flows but you get into a house you are
[1:41:45] trying to say certain things and the
[1:41:48] wife has to force to join the
[1:41:52] conversation you know you know when
[1:41:53] there is peace in the house you just
[1:41:56] look at the wife when there is no peace
[1:41:58] in the house you look at the house you
[1:42:01] know wives women they emotional they
[1:42:06] can't hide their
[1:42:12] emotions that's how God made them when
[1:42:16] they are not happy they are not
[1:42:20] happy you cannot force it on them
[1:42:24] just look at the
[1:42:26] woman that's the woman that's the church
[1:42:30] brother Bram says you want to see the
[1:42:33] level of the
[1:42:34] church look at the women in the church
[1:42:37] they are the reflection of the life of
[1:42:40] that church that's how God made a
[1:42:44] woman amen so he says he then went and
[1:42:49] visited the old I mean the poor couple
[1:42:55] they had a little old
[1:43:00] children
[1:43:02] amen and uh I slipped
[1:43:05] around so I could look through the
[1:43:11] crack you we the door being shoved
[1:43:16] open amen and there he was sitting in
[1:43:21] there and her on his
[1:43:25] lap and his hand around
[1:43:29] her and arm around
[1:43:34] him and he pulled out the
[1:43:40] paycheck he was laying it on the
[1:43:43] table say so much for
[1:43:50] groceries so much insurance
[1:43:54] and so much for the
[1:43:56] car and they couldn't make their ends
[1:44:03] meat you see come to find out he had
[1:44:08] seen a little dress up there in the
[1:44:12] window which he has been looking at for
[1:44:15] a couple of
[1:44:17] weeks and then he went and bought it and
[1:44:20] he says well honey
[1:44:23] you could look so pretty in
[1:44:26] this she said but
[1:44:30] honey I don't really need
[1:44:35] it it's not
[1:44:37] wealth that makes a
[1:44:43] home it's not wealth that makes a
[1:44:48] home because the scripture tells us a
[1:44:52] man's
[1:44:54] life consist not in the abundance of the
[1:44:57] things which he
[1:45:00] possesses amen there must be a life on
[1:45:04] the
[1:45:05] inside when the man has the love of
[1:45:10] Christ automatically the
[1:45:13] woman will produce the submission of the
[1:45:18] church so the scriptures instruct
[1:45:21] you on how to love
[1:45:23] her and keep her happy the scripture say
[1:45:28] husbands love your
[1:45:30] wives as Christ also loved the church
[1:45:33] and gave himself for
[1:45:36] [Applause]
[1:45:40] it when you go back from
[1:45:43] here just go and tell your wife
[1:45:47] honey I love
[1:45:50] you how many will do that
[1:45:57] husband
[1:46:00] okay somebody is
[1:46:03] lucky just go and tell I love
[1:46:07] you that's a
[1:46:10] CH
[1:46:11] amen let's go to Ephesians 5 verse
[1:46:16] 28 brother
[1:46:18] Fred that's good
[1:46:21] news let's go to ephes
[1:46:25] 528 so out men to love their
[1:46:34] wives as their own
[1:46:36] bodies he that loveth his
[1:46:39] wife loves
[1:46:42] himself because in the
[1:46:44] beginning he called their name
[1:46:48] Adam the wife was a mystery in this man
[1:46:53] here so they were one
[1:46:56] body but why did God
[1:47:00] allow this woman here to be BR
[1:47:05] Revelation it was because she was
[1:47:08] supposed to be the glory of the
[1:47:13] man are you together with me okay let's
[1:47:16] go a little further
[1:47:18] first for no man ever yet HED his own
[1:47:22] flesh
[1:47:24] but nourishes and
[1:47:26] cherishes even as the Lord the
[1:47:30] church so the word
[1:47:33] demands that you love

[1:47:51] trents and to change
[1:47:54] is to keep is to keep one Spirit
[1:47:59] warm amen by attend

[1:58:19] proved
[1:58:20] first and that's the
[1:58:23] mind that
[1:58:27] loves God says you know when he
[1:58:32] created he created two things come
[1:58:35] together husband wife husband wife
[1:58:38] husb but for the
[1:58:42] sake of being
[1:58:47] united and being

[1:59:04] name they share the character they share
[1:59:08] the flesh they share the B they share

[1:59:20] release this woman
[1:59:24] let me check out the mind
[1:59:28] of so he brings the
[1:59:30] animals to see what Adam would
[1:59:34] call and the scripture says whatever
[1:59:37] Adam
[1:59:38] called that was the name
[1:59:40] there not that Adam named the
[1:59:44] animals but that Adam got into the mind
[1:59:48] of God and knew every animal that passed
[1:59:52] by him he had the mind of God
[1:59:57] immediately after that he says it's not
[2:00:00] good for such a man who has my
[2:00:04] mind

[2:06:45] body those two bodies are
[2:06:49] different they act
[2:06:52] different and they even dress

[2:10:29] inseparable it is
[2:10:31] inseparable sometimes you are trying to

[2:11:29] areas just n
[2:11:32] her and cherish her all that she's doing
[2:11:37] you know you start saying I don't know
[2:11:38] what's wrong with this
[2:11:41] woman she's trying to
[2:11:44] appeal to the hidden
[2:11:48] elements your love is hidden
[2:11:51] so she tries to do certain
[2:11:54] things to reach your
[2:11:57] concern don't blame her for
[2:12:00] crying don't call her a
[2:12:02] child that's the way God
[2:12:11] made amen amen women will always
[2:12:14] communicate by
[2:12:20] emotions if you are not a man you'll
[2:12:23] hate those
[2:12:27] emotions but when you are a man you know
[2:12:30] somebody is appealing to
[2:12:33] me respect her
[2:12:37] tears she's a
[2:12:46] weak she's a woman if you are a man you
[2:12:51] start crying there is a problem with you
[2:12:55] you don't have a m
[2:12:59] [Applause]
[2:13:00] SP the Bible says dwell with her with
[2:13:06] understanding you must know their
[2:13:09] nature and their
[2:13:15] character Let's Just DE a little bit
[2:13:17] with the father
[2:13:20] condition
[2:13:25] God gives the
[2:13:27] man an opportunity to play two
[2:13:31] parts the part of the
[2:13:34] bridegroom and the part of
[2:13:37] Father the wife has only one part to
[2:13:42] play the part of the
[2:13:45] Bride the children have only one part
[2:13:49] but the husband
[2:13:51] has been given two parts he has a part
[2:13:54] to play as a
[2:13:57] husband amen the bridegroom and a part
[2:14:00] to play as
[2:14:02] father so manhood is about expression of
[2:14:07] love and also to be a
[2:14:10] guide to love your
[2:14:13] wife and then guide your
[2:14:16] children you don't become a father and
[2:14:19] you have children and you are totally
[2:14:22] useless to the crop that God has given
[2:14:26] you you are not putting them in the word
[2:14:30] you are not instructing them they are
[2:14:32] just
[2:14:37] grow listen Ephesians chapter
[2:14:43] 6 verse one
[2:14:45] says children obey your parents in the
[2:14:50] Lord
[2:14:51] for it is right honor thy father and
[2:14:56] mother which is the first commandment
[2:14:58] with the
[2:15:00] promise that it may be well with
[2:15:04] thee and thou mayest live long on the
[2:15:09] earth now parents use these
[2:15:13] scriptures to pull children into
[2:15:17] obedience but they are trying to reap
[2:15:21] where they did not
[2:15:24] s just like a man demanding
[2:15:29] submission from a woman he
[2:15:35] doesn't it doesn't
[2:15:38] work you see what I mean verse four says
[2:15:43] and you
[2:15:46] fathers provoke not your children Trust
[2:15:52] but bring them
[2:15:53] up in the natur and admonition of the
[2:15:59] Lord the scriptures expect the
[2:16:04] father to be a s of good
[2:16:08] seed in both
[2:16:10] friends and the wife by loving her and
[2:16:15] in the children by becoming their
[2:16:18] [Applause]
[2:16:19] gu amen God wants you to express both
[2:16:25] attributes play the part of the
[2:16:28] bridegroom and play the part of
[2:16:31] father when we are
[2:16:34] redeemed God plays both attributes in
[2:16:37] our
[2:16:39] lives he is our
[2:16:42] bridegroom as he is our
[2:16:46] [Applause]
[2:16:47] father amen so when the man CED
[2:16:51] was facing the final hours of his
[2:16:53] ministry on
[2:16:55] Earth Christ was facing the final hours
[2:16:59] of his
[2:17:03] Min he started viewing
[2:17:06] himself as the Lamb of
[2:17:10] God shifting from a a a teaching
[2:17:16] Prophet to enter into the attribute of
[2:17:20] the sacrifice
[2:17:23] from the son of
[2:17:25] man to the Son of
[2:17:28] God was near
[2:17:31] him and he needed his
[2:17:33] father by his
[2:17:36] side because he
[2:17:41] feared are you here with me you see now
[2:17:46] I'm trying to bring out something here
[2:17:49] to show you what a father is
[2:17:52] I've shown you what a bridegroom
[2:17:55] is but you need to know that the father
[2:17:59] is The Giver of
[2:18:02] comfort the cross was near him and he
[2:18:06] needed his father because he
[2:18:09] feared Hebrews chapter 5 verse
[2:18:13] 7 he says who in the days of his
[2:18:19] flesh
[2:18:21] when he offered up
[2:18:24] prayers and supplications with strong
[2:18:30] crying and tears him that was able to
[2:18:34] save him from
[2:18:37] death and he was
[2:18:40] heard in that he
[2:18:43] feared Jesus yes here reveals the
[2:18:48] Reliance of the son to the
[2:18:53] father a father must be present in the
[2:18:58] lives of his
[2:19:01] children he must be
[2:19:04] present because the moments
[2:19:07] come when the children fear they want to
[2:19:11] touch the concern of the
[2:19:15] father you must turn true to the two
[2:19:19] attributes
[2:19:22] that God
[2:19:24] is you have been given your
[2:19:28] wife to lead her by the mind of God and
[2:19:33] your children to play fatherhood
[2:19:38] too amen now listen in Mark
[2:19:42] 14
[2:19:44] verse4 and says unto
[2:19:48] them this is the son now
[2:19:52] is now not son of man
[2:19:55] anymore a teaching prophet he phasing
[2:19:59] into the Son of
[2:20:02] God a
[2:20:04] sacrifice a redeemer the work of
[2:20:08] priesthood he says unto them my soul is
[2:20:12] exceeding sorrowful after
[2:20:16] death tell he and
[2:20:19] watch and went forward a
[2:20:22] little and fell on the ground and prayed
[2:20:27] that if it were
[2:20:29] possible the hour might pass from
[2:20:32] him and he
[2:20:35] said
[2:20:38] father all things are possible unto
[2:20:42] thee take away this cup from
[2:20:45] me
[2:20:47] nevertheless not what I will but Thou
[2:20:50] Art
[2:20:52] wi so the
[2:20:54] lamb was
[2:20:58] bleeding in the garden of
[2:21:01] GE in that last hour he was a son
[2:21:06] pleading to the
[2:21:07] father because he feared you see how God
[2:21:11] changes his
[2:21:13] offices at one time he's a bridegroom at
[2:21:17] another time he's a father and
[2:21:21] as a man at one time you are a husband
[2:21:25] at another time you are a wife I mean
[2:21:27] you are a
[2:21:29] father are you together with me to
[2:21:32] fulfill both
[2:21:34] attributes that Christ plays
[2:21:39] in as bridegroom and
[2:21:44] father
[2:21:45] father all things are possible unto
[2:21:49] thee
[2:21:51] father that he could run to and cry
[2:21:57] father your children need
[2:22:02] you how we need to be a present
[2:22:06] father they need to see you first to
[2:22:10] first when they come to the crossroads
[2:22:12] of
[2:22:14] Life the scripture advises
[2:22:17] you to be a friend to your children
[2:22:22] he says don't provoke
[2:22:25] them playing both
[2:22:28] attributes
[2:22:30] bridegroom
[2:22:35] father praise the
[2:22:41] Lord just turn around and tell your
[2:22:45] friend I have to be a father to my
[2:22:49] children

[2:23:02] wife amen
[2:23:05] sunship needs
[2:23:10] leadership I'll take you to Romans
[2:23:13] 8 verse

[2:24:07] schools but they need your
[2:24:14] leadership for ye have not received the
[2:24:17] spirit of bondage again to fear
[2:24:23] but you have received the spirit of
[2:24:27] adoption whereby we cry AB
[2:24:31] father you remove the negative person
[2:24:35] from
[2:24:37] yourself and put on the love of
[2:24:41] God that could receive a sin in
[2:24:48] love that's what you need
[2:24:51] so that you can
[2:24:53] play the part of a
[2:24:56] father don't provoke your
[2:24:59] children amen don't impart the spirit of
[2:25:02] fear upon
[2:25:04] them even when they have done something

[2:25:11] world bring them close to
[2:25:14] you and become a leader of your
[2:25:18] children when God gave us the spirit of
[2:25:22] adoption Hallelujah the spirit of
[2:25:26] adoption means the spirit that guides
[2:25:32] us to
[2:25:34] adoption but before we get here we have
[2:25:38] made many
[2:25:40] mistakes from here to get to there but
[2:25:44] he gave us the
[2:25:46] spirit to bear with us to encourage
[2:25:51] to teach us to rebuke us until he brings
[2:25:55] us here that's the work of a
[2:26:00] [Applause]
[2:26:03] father when God gave us the spirit of
[2:26:08] adoption he was not looking at the
[2:26:12] spot where he gave us the spirit of
[2:26:16] adoption he was giving us the
[2:26:19] guide to take us to the
[2:26:22] adoption are you together with me praise

[2:29:23] wisdom but listen he has learned a whole
[2:29:28] lot and we go to ask
[2:29:31] him to see what he
[2:29:34] learned and then we can profit by
[2:29:39] his what he has
[2:29:43] learned a
[2:29:46] student and the Bible
[2:29:48] says I refused for a
[2:29:51] woman to speak in
[2:29:54] church if there is anything she wants to
[2:29:57] learn let her ask her
[2:30:01] husband at
[2:30:03] home but

[2:30:56] me show me father that has the mind of
[2:31:01] Christ by the word and I'll show you the
[2:31:04] man who has played both these
[2:31:09] attributes brother Bram preaching the
[2:31:12] message
[2:31:14] Elisha was in a discernment
[2:31:16] line and then turned to a man all of a
[2:31:19] sudden
[2:31:21] whose family was breaking
[2:31:23] up but you
[2:31:25] find that situation had a play of the
[2:31:29] spirit world to
[2:31:33] it the devil will not allow you to play
[2:31:40] bridegroom and father without a
[2:31:44] fight let me take you here in the
[2:31:47] message the prophet
[2:31:48] elishah he says how do you do all of a
[2:31:52] sudden he's turning to this man he's
[2:31:55] asking him how do you
[2:31:57] do do you believe me to be the servant
[2:32:00] of God many many other servants are here
[2:32:05] but I am his servant
[2:32:08] immediately there is a spirit pulling
[2:32:11] from this young
[2:32:14] man this boy is in
[2:32:17] trouble he's in trouble
[2:32:20] deeply in trouble the boy is
[2:32:23] suffering with a mental
[2:32:26] disorder you have just come from an
[2:32:32] institution and I see them giving you
[2:32:35] some kind of a a shock
[2:32:39] treatment they've given you shock
[2:32:43] treatment and you have an
[2:32:48] phobia
[2:32:51] that's it you see a face before you all

[2:32:57] time and it's it's your mother's face
[2:33:00] that you
[2:33:01] see you are a married man you have a
[2:33:05] wife and two
[2:33:07] children brother Bram is in a
[2:33:09] discernment
[2:33:11] L amen so there is a
[2:33:15] spiritual at
[2:33:17] play in the breaking of this marriage
[2:33:22] the first of a
[2:33:24] mother always stood before this
[2:33:28] boy whatever the first spoke to
[2:33:31] him we don't know but
[2:33:34] maybe to this boy the mother's
[2:33:40] qualities were the qualities of the best
[2:33:45] wife and he's not seeing them in him
[2:33:51] so he said there is a
[2:33:53] face that keeps standing before
[2:33:56] you oh it's the first of your
[2:33:59] mother and brother Bram is dealing with
[2:34:03] a marriage
[2:34:08] trouble and there are some men
[2:34:11] here to them a true wife is the
[2:34:16] character and nature of their
[2:34:18] mother
[2:34:22] they've not gone into the
[2:34:24] world to study the lives of the Holy
[2:34:31] Women he's looking like
[2:34:35] this my mother she used to do like this
[2:34:39] my
[2:34:40] mother at that time she do like this and
[2:34:42] the sisters would get
[2:34:45] tired hearing
[2:34:48] mama
[2:34:51] Mama brother said there is a first
[2:34:53] standing before
[2:34:55] you he was
[2:35:01] a he was a mama's
[2:35:03] boy and the mother has not died out of
[2:35:07] his
[2:35:09] face instead of putting his wife into
[2:35:13] the images of ho Bible
[2:35:15] women he wanted to keep seeing his
[2:35:18] mother in the life of his
[2:35:22] wife everything my mother my mother told
[2:35:27] my
[2:35:29] mother and the Bible says for this cause
[2:35:34] shall a man leave his father and
[2:35:37] mother to be joined to his wife and they
[2:35:41] too shall be one
[2:35:45] Bo are you together with me we continue
[2:35:48] with the quot Jesus
[2:35:51] Christ that come
[2:35:53] along and delivered the man in
[2:35:58] Gad is here tonight to deliver you from
[2:36:03] this and take that fobia from
[2:36:08] you
[2:36:10] theia was the first of a
[2:36:16] mother and drive the devil from you
[2:36:20] that you can return to your home
[2:36:23] well do you believe that do you believe
[2:36:27] that he sent me to do this for
[2:36:31] you you would you know would you bow
[2:36:37] your head and be
[2:36:39] reverent this is very treacherous and
[2:36:44] dangerous keep your head
[2:36:47] bow till you hear my voice say raise
[2:36:50] your
[2:36:52] head come here young man before this
[2:36:57] before I ask this blessing I'm going to
[2:37:00] ask you something will you obey me as
[2:37:03] his servant and do as I tell you to do
[2:37:07] you are going to get well the time of
[2:37:10] Deliverance is at this
[2:37:13] time this is a devil doing
[2:37:17] this young man
[2:37:20] he would drive you stuck
[2:37:24] mad keep you that way the rest of your
[2:37:29] life but God can restore you in your
[2:37:32] right mind and right mental conditions I
[2:37:36] see another thing you been to a
[2:37:40] psychiatrist trying to talk to you
[2:37:44] that's not the idea it takes more than
[2:37:47] that that for you
[2:37:50] it it takes the power of the Living God
[2:37:53] you understand me if you don't you will
[2:37:56] in a moment bow your head in
[2:38:00] reverence then he says Heavenly Father
[2:38:03] this young man standing here fin looking
[2:38:06] young fellow standing here in the stat
[2:38:09] of a Young
[2:38:10] Manhood and Satan has
[2:38:13] come to him to tear his home break up
[2:38:18] his family and drive this young man out
[2:38:22] into the
[2:38:26] wild
[2:38:28] once the fatherhood is
[2:38:31] broken the family is
[2:38:33] torn and the tearing of the family comes
[2:38:37] with a permanent
[2:38:39] Cloud over the
[2:38:41] family depression set sin over the
[2:38:45] father over the mother and over the
[2:38:48] children
[2:38:51] so we ministers we are not gifted like
[2:38:54] brother
[2:38:55] Bram to look under family
[2:39:00] situations and then tell it like he
[2:39:03] could but the only thing that tears down
[2:39:06] a
[2:39:07] family is a spirit
[2:39:11] world it's a
[2:39:14] spirit
[2:39:15] love love and submission
[2:39:20] does not break a
[2:39:25] family we enter into this
[2:39:29] institution with
[2:39:32] love and
[2:39:34] submission the prophet continues to pray
[2:39:38] but your
[2:39:39] God who made the heavens and the
[2:39:42] Earth who created all
[2:39:44] things through Christ Jesus I come as
[2:39:48] your servant in
[2:39:50] prayer of faith for this young
[2:39:53] man knowing that just now he can't have
[2:39:57] faith for himself because of his
[2:40:04] condition his mind had been
[2:40:08] blackened by a progressive Dark
[2:40:13] Cloud it has taken
[2:40:16] years maybe because they already have
[2:40:21] children they couldn't even get back to
[2:40:23] the
[2:40:25] Genesis they don't know where it started
[2:40:28] from but it's a progressive
[2:40:32] Cloud then he says Lord here the pray of
[2:40:35] your servant Satan is haunting at
[2:40:39] him and making his life
[2:40:43] misery but the Lord Jesus that set the
[2:40:47] maniac free
[2:40:50] that was Far Beyond this
[2:40:53] boy you can make this boy well
[2:40:57] tonight the prophet is dealing with this
[2:41:01] condition as a
[2:41:07] sickness are you together with me as a
[2:41:11] sickness so we step into the family to
[2:41:14] deal with their
[2:41:18] situations but the roots already planted
[2:41:21] and they are so
[2:41:23] deep and some of them are
[2:41:26] unique we need to
[2:41:29] rescue our
[2:41:32] [Applause]
[2:41:35] marriages the
[2:41:37] prophet you know he had the ability to
[2:41:41] see but for me God has just given me the
[2:41:45] word a normal Christian would not like
[2:41:49] to break the
[2:41:51] image that connects him to the nature of
[2:41:55] God Amen to be a
[2:41:58] bridegroom and to be a father the
[2:42:01] prophet continues and Satan you who
[2:42:04] bound him you kept the psychist
[2:42:11] hallelujah amen they got the
[2:42:16] psychist but the prophet is saying
[2:42:19] the devil has escaped those
[2:42:23] ones you've escaped the medical
[2:42:27] treatment he says but you cannot escape
[2:42:30] the power of
[2:42:32] God come out of him in the name of Jesus
[2:42:36] Christ go from him the thing wild passed
[2:42:40] out of the boy going in that
[2:42:45] direction are you seeing there spirit
[2:42:49] are responsible for breaking of
[2:42:53] families the prophet says the fers
[2:42:57] W coming out of that
[2:43:06] Bo so for any standing
[2:43:09] family is God for any breaking family it
[2:43:14] is for any standing family it is God and
[2:43:19] for any breaking
[2:43:21] family it's a
[2:43:23] spirit it's a spirit so on the
[2:43:28] side there could be a beautiful
[2:43:32] lady maybe who playing that jokes around
[2:43:37] you and when you nurse those
[2:43:41] jokes they tamper with the image of a
[2:43:47] man him being a
[2:43:51] bridegroom and him being a
[2:43:55] father it
[2:44:00] tempers let's go
[2:44:02] back identify the
[2:44:05] subject and we finish First
[2:44:09] Corinthians 11 verse 7 where we
[2:44:14] read for a man indeed not to cover his
[2:44:18] head
[2:44:21] for as much as the image and the glory
[2:44:24] of
[2:44:26] God but the woman is the glory of the
[2:44:30] man so there are two glories we are
[2:44:33] dealing with
[2:44:36] here the glory of God in the
[2:44:39] man and the glory of the man in the
[2:44:43] woman two things here so what's the
[2:44:46] glory of God in the man
[2:44:50] so when God speaks about the Bible
[2:44:54] man being the image and the glory of
[2:44:58] God is speaking about
[2:45:01] us like in the pr of
[2:45:04] Abraham who was the father of
[2:45:07] Nations even before he had seen
[2:45:11] Isaac
[2:45:13] adoption is the
[2:45:15] potential that every Son of God must
[2:45:19] have and must progressively grow
[2:45:25] into okay so second Corinthians
[2:45:30] 3:18 he says but we
[2:45:33] all with open
[2:45:35] f beholding as in a
[2:45:39] glass the glory of the
[2:45:41] Lord are changed into the same
[2:45:46] image from Glory to Glory even as the
[2:45:52] spirit of the
[2:45:53] Lord did you hear that so behold That
[2:45:58] Glory behold that
[2:46:02] glory and start walking into it
[2:46:06] progress get into the word and know what
[2:46:10] that glory
[2:46:11] is the man born
[2:46:14] again is in the glory of
[2:46:17] God Amen just like Adam was supposed to
[2:46:23] display the nature of God to
[2:46:27] Creation Adam was the glory of God
[2:46:32] presented before the
[2:46:35] animals so when Adam stood all nature
[2:46:39] stood with
[2:46:40] him and when he fell
[2:46:43] all and up to now is
[2:46:47] GR
[2:46:49] amen we want to see the first
[2:46:53] man the man before he fell in
[2:46:56] s Hallelujah Hall we want to see him he
[2:47:01] was the glory of God before all
[2:47:07] nature and so you as a man you are the
[2:47:11] foundation of your
[2:47:14] family when you stand the family will
[2:47:17] start you fall the family will
[2:47:25] fall Romans
[2:47:28] 819 he says for the honest expectation
[2:47:32] of the
[2:47:35] creature waited for the manifestation of
[2:47:38] the sons of
[2:47:40] God for the creature was made subject to
[2:47:46] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[2:47:49] him who has subjected the
[2:47:52] same in
[2:47:54] hope so all
[2:47:57] creation is waiting for man to be
[2:48:01] restored into the glory of God the
[2:48:05] Redemption of all
[2:48:07] nature lies in
[2:48:10] man restoring back into the glory of
[2:48:14] God okay so
[2:48:17] nature was subject to
[2:48:23] man in the glory of
[2:48:27] God and the success form
[2:48:30] also is subject to a
[2:48:33] man in the glory of God and when a man
[2:48:37] falls in those
[2:48:39] principles the subject
[2:48:45] suffer okay the wife suffers the kids
[2:48:50] suffer because the man has failed to
[2:48:53] find his
[2:48:56] position so there is no Son of God who
[2:49:00] understands
[2:49:02] himself to be so to be the strong
[2:49:07] Foundation that the fames built
[2:49:10] upon that would watch a crack coming
[2:49:13] into his
[2:49:15] life and does not
[2:49:17] care to breach
[2:49:22] it where is my
[2:49:25] weakness as a
[2:49:27] bridegroom and as a
[2:49:32] father I know you
[2:49:35] know but any Son of
[2:49:38] God who sees that
[2:49:40] crack will seal
[2:49:45] it he will repair the cracks
[2:49:50] he got
[2:49:51] God and cried to God for his
[2:49:55] family amen that man will enter Isaiah
[2:50:02] 58 and spend his time in prayer and
[2:50:06] fasting to become the repair of the
[2:50:10] bridge the repair of the paths to dwell
[2:50:14] in because they shall be of the you know
[2:50:18] because they that be of
[2:50:22] thee shall build the old west
[2:50:33] places sh up the
[2:50:36] foundation of many
[2:50:39] generations when you
[2:50:41] realize your weaknesses and your
[2:50:44] failures and you going prayer and
[2:50:47] fasting then you become the
[2:50:51] repairer amen of the bridge and the
[2:50:55] restor of the
[2:50:57] part of your
[2:51:00] family amen because those who come out
[2:51:03] of you shall
[2:51:06] build the worst
[2:51:09] places and you shall raise up the
[2:51:12] foundation of many
[2:51:15] generation the whole creation
[2:51:19] is for fathers like
[2:51:22] that when a man falls from that
[2:51:25] position I don't mean by drinking or by
[2:51:30] adultery but rather when he fails from
[2:51:33] upholding those
[2:51:35] principles everything around him Falls
[2:51:39] with him when Adam fell amen everything
[2:51:44] fell with in
[2:51:47] divorce
[2:51:52] a Son of God can never think about
[2:51:59] divor because in
[2:52:02] divorce family
[2:52:04] scatters the joys
[2:52:06] flee your prayers will hit a Breen
[2:52:13] scy amen so your
[2:52:17] glory
[2:52:20] and there will be a dark
[2:52:22] cloud that will permanently go around
[2:52:25] with
[2:52:26] you the streets will Point At
[2:52:29] You the wonderful
[2:52:35] father a man is the glory of God and
[2:52:39] your wife needs to best That
[2:52:43] Glory so that she can
[2:52:47] shine you are the Sun and she's the
[2:52:52] moon she needs some Glory from the
[2:52:56] husband to this
[2:53:00] place Amen brother Bram says when God
[2:53:05] made the heavens and the
[2:53:06] Earth he made the moon to
[2:53:09] shine in the obsess of the sun to give
[2:53:13] light while the sun was
[2:53:15] gone a beautiful type of Christ and the
[2:53:20] church the church is the Moon to give
[2:53:24] the glory to the
[2:53:25] world while the son is
[2:53:29] God so what I mean a lesser
[2:53:34] light amen and then otherwise the moon
[2:53:39] and the sun is husband and wife as
[2:53:43] Christ and the church his husband and
[2:53:45] wife the wife being the weak of Vel only
[2:53:49] gives a smaller light in the absence of
[2:53:52] the husband and the church can only make
[2:53:57] manifestation of the Holy Spirit and
[2:54:01] remember the moon cannot give any light
[2:54:05] of and when you see the
[2:54:08] Moonlight it's not the
[2:54:10] Moonlight it's the reflection of the
[2:54:14] sunlight and Christ ascends up
[2:54:19] is that right and shines his
[2:54:22] light on the church to reflect the
[2:54:26] light and the power of the church in his
[2:54:30] absence amen so the moon broadcast the
[2:54:35] light of
[2:54:37] the you must give
[2:54:40] her you must give your wife a certain
[2:54:44] amount of light to
[2:54:47] shine hallelujah hallelujah you must
[2:54:50] give her a certain amount of
