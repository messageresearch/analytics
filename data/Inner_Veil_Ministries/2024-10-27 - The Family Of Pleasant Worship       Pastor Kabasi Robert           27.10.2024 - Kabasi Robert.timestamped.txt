[33:56] and they took them wives of the women of
[33:59] Moab the name of the one opah and the
[34:02] name of the other Ruth and they dwelt
[34:05] there about 10 years and Mahon and Chon

[36:25] people the old people to the Aged and
[36:29] every type of
[36:30] category there's a way the Lord speaks
[36:33] to every
[36:36] category amen so when we come to the
[36:40] married I believe that God speaks to the
[36:42] married
[36:43] people still in a very very special
[36:47] way because they are the type of him and
[36:50] the
[36:52] church amen so there is no way you see
[36:57] everything that we have on the earth
[36:59] must be speaking of
[37:01] God when you are young you are in the
[37:05] age of the youth and
[37:07] whatever the Lord says you are you are a
[37:10] bride the bride is in that
[37:14] age but when you marry then you
[37:18] reflection of Christ and his
[37:21] church amen amen so this evening I'll
[37:25] just share something on the family of
[37:27] pleas
[37:31] toship amen taking
[37:35] Ruth and and her
[37:37] family which was you know from the
[37:41] family of
[37:46] el
[37:47] amen I always do a lot of writing but I
[37:51] don't have ating
[37:58] when I used to Sunday school here people
[38:00] used to say he's a
[38:04] teacher I draw
[38:08] CHS and bring them up but it's just the
[38:12] the way the Lord shaped
[38:15] me so when we talk about a family of
[38:18] pleasant
[38:22] worship we just want to look at the of
[38:28] amen as a believing
[38:31] family that started on very
[38:34] well that was ordained of
[38:37] God and when you look at their
[38:41] startup it's entirely the family that
[38:44] reflects
[38:46] God Amen because as we started through
[38:49] the
[38:50] prophet we know
[38:53] that it means a worship
[38:58] amen and when you go to the study in the
[39:01] Bible they say my God is
[39:07] king So the real man a Believer he must
[39:12] be able to be a real believer and a
[39:15] worshiper of
[39:19] God Tye the
[39:24] husbands amen every true man
[39:28] a real
[39:29] Christian must have God as his
[39:34] King and he must be a worshiper of
[39:38] God Amen and then when he got
[39:42] married he got married
[39:46] toii which means my
[39:51] delight which means
[39:54] Pleasant amen so when man who is
[39:58] worshiping
[40:00] God marries a
[40:03] woman he marries something which is
[40:07] Pleasant something which is a
[40:10] delight something which puts his heart
[40:13] on
[40:14] fire amen so the man worshiping
[40:19] God marries a woman called
[40:25] delight and then they become a pleasant
[40:31] worshiper amen and a family of
[40:35] Believers always starts with that as the
[40:39] formul pleasant
[40:44] worship should a man Mar a woman who he
[40:47] doesn't Delight
[40:51] in it will be a
[40:54] problem or should a woman Mar a man who
[40:57] doesn't worship
[41:00] God it will be always a
[41:03] problem is that amen the woman must
[41:07] bring PR into the
[41:09] home and the man must bring Worship in
[41:12] the
[41:15] home amen true
[41:19] worship is always Guided by a
[41:22] man amen and all the joy that comes in a
[41:26] home
[41:28] is always moded by the
[41:31] woman so when people get
[41:34] married always Pleasant
[41:38] worship amen before during it should be
[41:44] always Pleasant
[41:48] worship amen so a home begins with
[41:52] worship and
[41:55] pleasant amen when the
[41:58] two are united
[42:01] together then that
[42:03] house that house it will be House of
[42:08] God because the Bible tells
[42:12] us come
[42:14] together and they agree upon anything I
[42:18] will be in their
[42:21] mid and God God himself cannot be God
[42:28] without people woring
[42:30] him amen he was Elohim El but the
[42:36] prophet tells us because he desired a
[42:40] family then it made him
[42:43] Jehovah which is God and God is an image
[42:47] of
[42:48] worship so if a man is a
[42:51] worshiper then he must be worshiping God
[42:55] and whever God is worshiping
[42:58] that's where he will come so a man must
[43:02] be able to bring God by his life into
[43:06] the
[43:08] family it's our responsibility as
[43:11] men amen and as the man brings
[43:16] worship which is God now in the
[43:19] ministry then the woman must be able to
[43:22] do
[43:24] Pleasant if you remember when God
[43:26] visited
[43:29] Abraham did he to it was
[43:33] Abraham amen the Angels first met
[43:37] Abraham Abraham
[43:39] worshiped Abraham know praised God
[43:43] Abraham started having fellowship with
[43:46] God as long as Abraham was having
[43:48] fellowship with
[43:50] God was happening to
[43:52] Sarah God
[43:55] underscore because sah was
[43:57] laughing when she would drop what was
[44:00] happening it wasn't
[44:03] realistic is that amen and God was
[44:06] looking but had he visited it was
[44:11] Abraham and Abraham now begin to say sah
[44:16] prepare
[44:17] something sah do this sah let us make
[44:22] our
[44:25] visors amen
[44:27] but who is the head of that is the
[44:33] man when a man
[44:37] goship
[44:39] go that
[44:41] amen and it's very
[44:43] important women areed in a way
[44:50] of they dress
[44:52] pleasantly they talk
[44:55] pleasantly they walk
[44:58] pleasantly the way they arrange the
[45:00] house is to
[45:01] pleas the way they dress the children is
[45:04] to
[45:05] pleas everything is
[45:07] pleasing and she must be
[45:10] pleasing is that she must please the
[45:15] husband amen and the husband must stay
[45:18] in
[45:20] position a
[45:22] worshiper a servant of God when God went
[45:26] to is the house of
[45:29] lot he never went to the wife where did
[45:32] he go to lot when Adam and Eve
[45:38] sinned went to Eve where did he go to
[45:44] Adam where are you why he the head he
[45:49] must be able to be the lead
[45:57] if you watch it very
[46:00] carefully from a few houses where people
[46:03] are
[46:05] blessed women will always Drug In
[46:10] Worship yeah will always Drug In
[46:16] Worship Is that amen the man is always
[46:20] the
[46:21] driver I always tell people that in the
[46:24] morning if were to check what has
[46:26] happened in people's
[46:29] homes the church is the only assembling
[46:32] place but before they leave
[46:35] homes
[46:37] areay there must be some to
[46:41] drive is that amen and as they
[46:45] drive you know that's how worship begins
[46:48] and will be happy with
[46:50] that God will not punish them for doing
[46:54] that amen because for the sisters are
[47:00] uning working on the
[47:03] foring on the ears working on the dress

[47:10] pleasing is that
[47:13] amen but husband we must go we must

[47:54] are of a woman it makes things
[48:02] different is that amen the sockes have
[48:06] got to be ordered where they supposed to
[48:09] be
[48:12] so stocks
[48:16] yeah the stockings of a man know
[48:19] sometime men just throw their
[48:21] stocks they throw the tie there they
[48:24] throw the cour there somebody want thing

[48:30] pleasantly amen be saying No this is

[48:36] be
[48:37] here and the brothers don't like
[48:40] that sometime the toothbrush is thrown
[48:43] that
[48:44] way the brush is thrown the another way
[48:47] and they want it to be they want to use
[48:49] it the
[48:50] following when they are told please this
[48:54] should be done like this too much
[48:59] but she want things to be
[49:04] pleas is that
[49:09] amen see at home just to give a little
[49:14] example we have I've got my daughter
[49:17] patience she's very orderly patience
[49:19] patience is very
[49:22] order and Joseph is a Freel
[49:28] amen so sometimes when she's
[49:33] moing Joseph is not very
[49:37] careful so what she no entering this
[49:40] house until I have finished
[49:44] this we must put things this way we must
[49:46] put things
[49:50] this so he has got to
[49:53] obey then afterward sometimes he would
[49:56] say
[49:57] I have fought a good
[49:59] fight I finished the rest now the rest
[50:02] of the people can
[50:04] enter Because she want things to be
[50:08] pleasant in a woman
[50:11] friends sister if that is not in
[50:14] you you'll find things a bit
[50:18] hard put things in a pleasant
[50:24] way is that amen so here is a story that
[50:28] we are
[50:30] following because the Bible says it says
[50:34] behold in Psalms
[50:36] 133 behold how good and pleasant it is
[50:40] for Brethren to dwell together
[50:46] in amen when home is
[50:50] together when a home is
[50:52] United how good and pleasant it is for
[50:57] our
[50:58] home it's like a precious ointment upon
[51:01] the
[51:02] head that R down upon the
[51:06] Beard's beard went down to the SCS of
[51:09] his
[51:10] G so when people dwell
[51:13] together it's
[51:15] Pleasant and God will always come
[51:18] down is that amen if you give real
[51:23] worship B says God will be
[51:28] amen when a
[51:33] rightship God was
[51:37] pleased amen and when he was pleased
[51:41] then the pillow of fire
[51:44] came it's pleasing when you do the right
[51:48] thing it's pleasing when the home is
[51:51] together when the man is taking his
[51:54] position and the woman is taking her
[51:59] it says as it's like the ointment which
[52:02] was flowing
[52:04] down it makes the it Mak things
[52:09] easy oil soften
[52:13] things amen it breaks down all the
[52:18] things so as long as as long as
[52:28] was which me
[52:31] worship he was in of
[52:34] worship things were moving and as long
[52:40] asii when they in the right
[52:44] place and what was the right
[52:51] place the house of God is
[52:54] bread amen amen as long as you are in
[52:57] that
[52:59] house where you can eat the word of
[53:02] God where both of you can dwell
[53:06] there and eat the word you will have
[53:09] pleasant
[53:13] worship amen what brings
[53:17] problems is when one lets
[53:21] go I'm going to talk about two
[53:24] things and when the prophet was
[53:26] preaching the message choosing of a
[53:29] bride he emphasized two
[53:32] things he
[53:34] says must be born
[53:37] again he must be born
[53:41] again then two says
[53:46] character is that amen two things he
[53:50] never preached
[53:54] discipline he preached character
[53:58] I hope yeah that's right I think there
[54:00] is a wide difference between
[54:04] discipline and
[54:07] character when you are
[54:10] choosing you choose character according
[54:12] to
[54:14] God you don't choose
[54:19] discipline is that amen so we are going
[54:23] so the character must be one that fear
[54:26] has
[54:28] God somebody who is given unto
[54:32] God that is
[54:34] somebody whom you can
[54:37] correct somebody you can
[54:40] M somebody who can be Chang he must
[54:44] first of all be having the fear of
[54:50] God is that
[54:52] amen the moment one of us
[54:56] loses the hold of
[54:59] God then
[55:02] discipline will become a key
[55:05] judgment will become the key for
[55:11] judgment you holding to
[55:14] God each of you will judge one another
[55:16] by
[55:18] character and
[55:20] character is not a gift character is a
[55:25] victory the things that you go
[55:28] through and they later on produce Christ
[55:31] in your
[55:33] life discipline is
[55:38] trained is that amen so when people get
[55:43] lose about
[55:46] God they begin to judge one another by
[55:52] [Music]
[55:54] discipline she doesn't KNE
[56:00] down she doesn't greet
[56:06] me that's
[56:08] discipline and that one is trained from
[56:11] home is that amen and that
[56:15] one even in a
[56:18] home you'll find people having different
[56:25] disin is that amen same father
[56:30] mother but their discipline is
[56:33] different actually they can even tell
[56:35] you that boy or that girl is not
[56:40] disciplin but he at
[56:43] home now when they are giving
[56:46] you they don't give
[56:49] you somebody who is not
[56:53] disciplined they give you a character
[56:56] which means it can be worked
[56:59] upon and to certain
[57:02] level is
[57:05] that so
[57:08] herei was
[57:10] sa as long
[57:16] as he can eat the word can also eat
[57:21] the but the moment Tres begin to come
[57:27] because first
[57:28] year second year maybe you can bear with
[57:32] one
[57:33] another maybe first month second month
[57:38] you can bear with one another why it's
[57:41] only two
[57:44] people it is
[57:50] is it is
[57:52] worship and
[57:54] pleasantness let's and pray let us go
[57:58] let's go
[58:01] out out that's all that works in the
[58:04] first few few
[58:06] times a few days few
[58:10] months come I
[58:13] you like the way we do when they
[58:17] wedding open your
[58:23] mouth it is Pleasant n
[58:28] thank
[58:33] God
[58:34] [Music]
[58:37] pleas then
[58:40] afterwards a child is
[58:44] born and the child who is
[58:47] born is called
[58:56] is that
[58:58] amen the
[59:02] first and the prophet tells us what is
[59:06] that
[59:08] sickness the name
[59:11] means
[59:13] sickness out of your
[59:16] union you are
[59:18] surprised sickness is coming
[59:22] up out of your pleasantness and joy and
[59:28] sickness comes
[59:32] up she's weak every
[59:35] morning she doesn't wake up like the way
[59:37] she used to wake
[59:40] up she's vomiting
[59:45] every
[59:49] hosp what is it out of the
[59:53] relationship a child is coming but it
[59:56] begins with
[1:00:02] sickness and that begins another
[1:00:05] approach of
[1:00:08] things
[1:00:09] amen then if if you didn't choose
[1:00:14] character begin to see the discipline
[1:00:20] coming because there are sometimes
[1:00:26] some of
[1:00:28] them become so
[1:00:35] irritated amen everything is
[1:00:39] irritating some of them can begin
[1:00:44] quarreling a little thing they are
[1:00:50] sh and you said they used to tell me
[1:00:58] they used to
[1:00:59] tell you see Pastor used to warn us we
[1:01:03] should choose character but I think I
[1:01:04] didn't
[1:01:05] hear that is discipline that is not
[1:01:11] character is that amen it's
[1:01:16] discipline but it's coming out of
[1:01:19] circumstance is
[1:01:22] born sickness is
[1:01:24] born before they knew that the second
[1:01:28] one was worse than the first
[1:01:31] one it
[1:01:34] was
[1:01:42] Meo amen and before they knew
[1:01:46] that fell in the
[1:01:49] land that's external forces
[1:01:57] she's having two
[1:01:59] children she can't
[1:02:01] work she's there all the time in
[1:02:05] hospital bills are
[1:02:08] accumulating and what is
[1:02:14] happening instead of
[1:02:17] pleasant she's no longer
[1:02:20] Pleasant things are changing so what
[1:02:23] happen is they leave the house of
[1:02:28] Fellowship because of internal and
[1:02:31] external
[1:02:33] pressures they decided to go somewhere
[1:02:38] out and where did they
[1:02:45] go something a little bit like a
[1:02:48] Christian or not Christian you know we
[1:02:50] are we are still in
[1:02:51] church but these days we are too
[1:02:54] busy s in
[1:02:56] church now let me tell you that's where
[1:03:01] danger begins to sleep
[1:03:05] in
[1:03:11] amen
[1:03:15] dies the moment troubles push them out
[1:03:19] of the real
[1:03:21] worship out of the place of worship
[1:03:25] God has got a chosen place where he
[1:03:28] wants to be worshiped the TR pushed them
[1:03:33] out of
[1:03:35] that if Satan can get you on the ground
[1:03:39] where you don't have
[1:03:42] protection he will with
[1:03:46] you he will with
[1:03:49] you so they went to Moab the first thing
[1:03:53] which
[1:03:54] died was
[1:04:02] the bread
[1:04:05] winner the bre
[1:04:09] winner
[1:04:11] died and the
[1:04:13] children were left just in the hands of
[1:04:19] pleasant and without a real guidance of
[1:04:24] worship if a man is not in his
[1:04:28] position and worship has
[1:04:31] died the children will marry anything
[1:04:36] they
[1:04:41] find is that amen you have moved a long
[1:04:46] way you have born
[1:04:48] sicknesses born Bloom you born
[1:04:52] stubbornness but never get out of
[1:04:54] Bethlehem
[1:04:56] never get out of the true place of
[1:04:59] worship when you get out of there into
[1:05:04] something which looks like a real
[1:05:05] Christian but not a
[1:05:08] Christian worship will
[1:05:14] die you will be the same person but they
[1:05:18] will tell to you like the way they ask
[1:05:19] those people can you sing for us the the
[1:05:22] songs of Zion
[1:05:26] and then you will say how can we sing
[1:05:30] the Lord songs when we in a Strange
[1:05:35] Land you are supposed to
[1:05:38] be simple
[1:05:44] principles let me say this that every
[1:05:47] time you get
[1:05:49] married the V
[1:05:53] is you know you will be able B to stay
[1:05:56] together in in riches and in
[1:06:05] poverty uh in sickness and in health
[1:06:10] those are two major
[1:06:14] things if you are able to stay
[1:06:17] together when sickness has come you are
[1:06:21] getting
[1:06:22] somewhere because it will come
[1:06:27] is that amen if you a to stay together
[1:06:31] when poverty has
[1:06:34] come you're getting somewhere because
[1:06:43] will every house will be tested by
[1:06:47] that there will be a
[1:06:52] sometime there will be a lck sometime
[1:06:57] but the L should never drive you from
[1:07:00] the original
[1:07:03] place where you have
[1:07:06] defense I've always given this example I
[1:07:09] don't know how true and deep it is but
[1:07:12] it is this
[1:07:15] way dogs die more on the
[1:07:20] road at
[1:07:23] home why when dog goes
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:30] out it doesn't
[1:07:35] fear but when it goes
[1:07:38] out it loses
[1:07:42] Direction it loses
[1:07:44] control so it's just going
[1:07:48] like when it sees the vehicle it's
[1:07:51] standing there it's guarding where it's
[1:07:54] not supposed to guard
[1:08:01] and dogs die very much they are very
[1:08:03] tough and they don't you don't threaten
[1:08:08] them they car
[1:08:11] nature but in a Strange
[1:08:13] Land you will not
[1:08:18] survive is that amen you have CED a part
[1:08:22] of your Christian values
[1:08:25] long as you are out of Bethlehem you in
[1:08:33] Moab it will be
[1:08:36] problems the prophet
[1:08:41] says he asked a young man young man
[1:08:45] asked me the other day you think I could
[1:08:48] ow to get
[1:08:50] married such and such a girl I said how
[1:08:54] much do you think of her
[1:08:57] said oh my I just love her I said well
[1:09:00] if you are not going to live without
[1:09:03] her you better marry her then but if you
[1:09:06] can live without
[1:09:08] her you better not so but if it is going
[1:09:11] to kill
[1:09:13] you you better go ahead and get
[1:09:16] married and so what was I trying to get
[1:09:18] to
[1:09:19] him this that if you love her so
[1:09:23] much right in
[1:09:25] now before you are
[1:09:28] married everything is just fine and
[1:09:32] D worship
[1:09:36] pleasant but after you get
[1:09:39] married then the TOs and the trials of
[1:09:43] Life come
[1:09:46] in that's when you have got to be so in
[1:09:50] love that you understand one another
[1:09:57] when you are disappointed in
[1:10:00] her she is disappointed in
[1:10:03] you you still understand one
[1:10:08] another is that amen because you are
[1:10:11] going to disappoint one
[1:10:14] another as long as you are staying
[1:10:17] together you have those
[1:10:20] differences you are two families you
[1:10:23] have lived with your family for 20
[1:10:26] years has lived with his family for 20
[1:10:29] years now you are bringing all those
[1:10:32] complications in
[1:10:41] those after you have gotten married you
[1:10:45] need to have loved
[1:10:46] her otherwi there are things you will
[1:10:50] see say I wish I didn't see I wish I saw
[1:10:54] it before
[1:10:56] it's good you didn't see
[1:11:01] it because you need to be worked
[1:11:05] up your patience needs to be
[1:11:08] worked your gentl needs to be
[1:11:11] worked your character needs to
[1:11:13] grow because character grows sometimes
[1:11:18] we say that man has
[1:11:20] character what are you talking about
[1:11:22] character is a victory he must be able
[1:11:25] to overcome certain things then you can
[1:11:28] attach a character upon that
[1:11:31] person you only talking about
[1:11:35] discipline which was a training at
[1:11:39] home which you can bring very good
[1:11:43] values you were trained with at
[1:11:46] home and to another one they are
[1:11:52] vies to another person they are vies
[1:11:58] VI yeah it's not a virtue it's a
[1:12:02] vice it's not it's not a good character
[1:12:06] to them it's nothing really no
[1:12:10] sense is that amen because homes train
[1:12:13] their
[1:12:15] children they are girls oh you know you
[1:12:18] must greet must PL you must do whatever
[1:12:23] now you go and you hand such a person
[1:12:26] into the of another
[1:12:28] one the others that is
[1:12:31] useless where he grew
[1:12:34] up do
[1:12:38] that so for you when you are doing it
[1:12:41] just looking
[1:12:50] at to them that is not a value at all
[1:12:55] say what do you want me to
[1:12:57] do he says but for you is
[1:13:02] dir you are not
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:07] styish your
[1:13:09] values are
[1:13:14] somebody's you are trying to stay in the
[1:13:17] kitchen for sisters they always watching
[1:13:24] TV and they're working on their hair and
[1:13:27] they getting the good perfume but for
[1:13:29] you not asking for even a
[1:13:40] perfume are we together you
[1:13:44] know we were in a certain
[1:13:47] family and you know the landl was
[1:13:50] brought up in a very very wonderful way
[1:13:55] hard worker and everything always you
[1:13:57] know putting everything in order
[1:14:02] working so the boys who were
[1:14:04] around they made a
[1:14:07] comment you know the
[1:14:09] husband went for another
[1:14:12] woman and they were
[1:14:14] saying you know this
[1:14:18] one the husband could not put up with
[1:14:21] her got somebody you know who is at
[1:14:23] least stylish
[1:14:29] this
[1:14:31] whatever you the world
[1:14:37] Jud so that can bring a
[1:14:40] conflict why are people fighting
[1:14:43] in a matter of values that are
[1:14:46] different bring on
[1:14:49] table we must bring the real character
[1:14:51] of Jesus Christ the love of God
[1:14:57] let your husband never
[1:15:03] leaveth never help him you will lose
[1:15:11] him is that
[1:15:13] amen you may be having
[1:15:16] poverty because as long as children have
[1:15:18] increased
[1:15:25] is that amen but stay where the drops of
[1:15:29] meres are
[1:15:30] bright when you are disappointed in
[1:15:34] her it says and she's disappointed in
[1:15:37] you you still understand
[1:15:43] one that's the way it is with Christ see
[1:15:46] we have got to be so in love with him
[1:15:49] when we ask for something and he doesn't
[1:15:51] give it to us that doesn't shake us a
[1:15:54] bit
[1:16:01] so I don't know in this family whether
[1:16:03] it was who was pressing so
[1:16:06] much other people always they go outside
[1:16:09] other people always they do this but for
[1:16:11] you are
[1:16:18] here and now the family is going to kill
[1:16:21] us and now we have our two children and
[1:16:22] now
[1:16:28] so what
[1:16:30] happens
[1:16:32] Journey up
[1:16:35] toab and when they reached Moab they
[1:16:38] were like a
[1:16:40] dog has been in an
[1:16:42] enclosure now it is outside what happens
[1:16:46] the light
[1:16:47] knocked it's
[1:16:52] concentration he died
[1:16:55] after that the
[1:16:58] children married outside of the
[1:17:04] church that's another
[1:17:08] danger is that amen
[1:17:12] worship the children once they don't
[1:17:14] have a
[1:17:16] guidance to them it was very
[1:17:19] easy they married
[1:17:23] moabites and
[1:17:25] happen they also
[1:17:30] died Pleasant
[1:17:35] worship with sickness
[1:17:38] M with Gloom and
[1:17:43] sadness the moment worship
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:47] left these two took a hold of the
[1:17:52] situation they took a hold of the
[1:17:54] situation it was now sickness and
[1:17:59] Gloom and then
[1:18:03] death what
[1:18:05] happen the name
[1:18:10] changed no more
[1:18:13] worship the home has changed are we
[1:18:16] together the next thing that has come
[1:18:20] Pleasant no longer there
[1:18:26] it
[1:18:28] became what does
[1:18:31] mean
[1:18:33] bitterness
[1:18:41] sadness what are we talking
[1:18:44] about stay where theop ofes are bright
[1:18:49] amen the only thing that always brings
[1:18:52] chaos in a home
[1:18:56] unbearable
[1:18:58] chaos is when
[1:19:00] people worship
[1:19:04] dies because of living
[1:19:11] fellow is that
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:16] now in the interest of time I just now
[1:19:18] be
[1:19:19] speaking the prophet gives us a story
[1:19:22] about lot
[1:19:26] lot and his
[1:19:29] wife it says lot left
[1:19:33] Abraham and went with his
[1:19:37] family just exctly like the
[1:19:42] way left
[1:19:45] Beth and went with his
[1:19:50] family but
[1:19:52] now l l failed to
[1:19:56] see because he was the
[1:20:00] leader he didn't see
[1:20:03] ahead that where he's going there's
[1:20:09] no where he
[1:20:11] going it is
[1:20:16] commotion he didn't
[1:20:19] know but he would not come back with his
[1:20:22] wife
[1:20:25] not only his wife didn't know that he
[1:20:29] would not come back with his
[1:20:34] children Lord did not also know that he
[1:20:38] would end up sleeping with his own
[1:20:45] children but if you follow the
[1:20:47] story he says when a
[1:20:50] Christian regardless of what happens
[1:20:54] when he leaves the God given
[1:20:59] position where he is
[1:21:03] fed if is
[1:21:06] strong will be
[1:21:12] powerless why he from
[1:21:21] theion so
[1:21:23] Church a blessing for God for us to have
[1:21:27] children it's a blessing for us to get
[1:21:30] married it's pleasing to
[1:21:33] God
[1:21:34] pleas what do you
[1:21:36] do whatever they are going to be these
[1:21:39] two types of forces I'm going to talk
[1:21:41] about one sometimes it is
[1:21:45] lack and sometimes it is
[1:21:50] Pless sometimes people are pushed
[1:21:55] and they suffer in the home because of
[1:22:03] Plenty that's why David
[1:22:05] said God don't give me much don't give
[1:22:10] me
[1:22:10] riches because I will eat and forget
[1:22:13] about but again don't give me poverty
[1:22:17] because I will
[1:22:19] steal and I shame your name the two
[1:22:22] extremes always keep the houses out of
[1:22:28] sometimes people are so
[1:22:30] humble as the prophet says the message
[1:22:33] influen sometime they are so good he
[1:22:37] says maybe they have
[1:22:39] nothing but as they continue in the
[1:22:41] presence of God then God blesses
[1:22:46] them the moment they are
[1:22:48] blessed the blessings push them out of
[1:22:52] Fellowship
[1:22:58] and we have seen people who are very
[1:23:01] obedient as long as they are
[1:23:03] poor but let them get
[1:23:06] something they are not
[1:23:08] ruled it's like a children
[1:23:11] obedi when they don't have a
[1:23:14] diploma when they don't have a degree
[1:23:16] let them get a degree and then then the
[1:23:19] parents are
[1:23:21] nothing let your blessings
[1:23:24] never push you away from the S of
[1:23:27] blessings but let your blessings dra you
[1:23:31] much
[1:23:32] closer the source of
[1:23:34] blessings never disconnect yourself
[1:23:37] regardless of what God
[1:23:39] does if your wife is becoming
[1:23:43] stubborn if your husband is becoming
[1:23:46] stubborn don't you ever push yourself or
[1:23:50] push him out of the presence of God
[1:24:00] Church you are better off with the man
[1:24:02] who listens to the
[1:24:05] word and the woman who listens to the
[1:24:08] word the man who doesn't who
[1:24:13] doesn't but sometimes bless push
[1:24:20] us the inability to contain a little
[1:24:23] blessing
[1:24:28] the prophet says maybe you used to have
[1:24:30] a
[1:24:32] bicycle blesses you with a
[1:24:35] car and from there you move to a better
[1:24:39] neighborhood and you get a better class
[1:24:41] of people and before you knew you are in
[1:24:44] a better
[1:24:45] Association you begin to associate with
[1:24:48] drunken you begin to do things that you
[1:24:51] never used to do when you do that
[1:24:55] you will blame your family because it
[1:24:57] will begin to
[1:25:05] disintegrate whatever
[1:25:07] happens
[1:25:09] keep your touch with the Lord let it
[1:25:11] never get
[1:25:14] lose
[1:25:16] amen let me just look at something here
[1:25:21] I'm saying that insufficiency
[1:25:24] can also be another
[1:25:27] problem because when things are very
[1:25:32] bad you know a very poor
[1:25:36] man is very hard to
[1:25:47] laugh it can either way it's not easy to
[1:25:51] love a poor man
[1:25:56] together because
[1:25:59] poverty is a
[1:26:07] real the I want tell
[1:26:11] you if there is no
[1:26:15] character that's where no disciplines
[1:26:17] will come
[1:26:22] out poverty
[1:26:25] goes
[1:26:27] along with a lot of
[1:26:30] sickness it brings
[1:26:33] bitterness I mean when you are
[1:26:36] poor sometimes it brings a lot of
[1:26:41] complications I want to use the real
[1:26:44] word
[1:26:47] complic okay
[1:26:54] poverty
[1:26:58] brings amen you begin to measure
[1:27:03] salt you begin to
[1:27:10] me to measure
[1:27:12] food this I
[1:27:15] [Music]
[1:27:18] yester it's already over it's poverty
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:26] poor men are very complicated
[1:27:34] people when a man is poor the woman must
[1:27:37] be real
[1:27:41] patient if the woman is working and she
[1:27:43] delays to come
[1:27:46] back that's when you see the poor
[1:27:50] man it's because I don't have a job
[1:27:52] that's why you are coming back I had a
[1:27:57] job don't respect me any small thing
[1:28:01] respect because I'm
[1:28:06] poor poverty can even kill your home
[1:28:09] when you
[1:28:13] are because it makes you very
[1:28:20] delicate a poor man is very
[1:28:25] and in that
[1:28:27] delicacy sometime they become
[1:28:33] we so God help the husbands have
[1:28:38] money that
[1:28:43] amen you see even transport transport
[1:28:47] here we can walk here we for you always
[1:28:49] want
[1:29:00] but you try to normalize
[1:29:07] things because of poverty i' people who
[1:29:10] count even the pieces of
[1:29:18] meat so the sister will be you know it's
[1:29:21] not really that's not character that's
[1:29:22] now discipline
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:26] he begins to pick out the discipline of
[1:29:28] his
[1:29:29] home for us by the way at
[1:29:32] home
[1:29:39] be
[1:29:40] now when supplies go
[1:29:44] down people begin to devise either
[1:29:47] defensive or attacking or protective
[1:29:51] measures
[1:30:00] but I want to tell you
[1:30:03] Christians if you want to
[1:30:05] prosper stay in the presence of
[1:30:09] God whatever little that God is blessing
[1:30:12] you
[1:30:13] with as a family thank
[1:30:17] God give
[1:30:19] your be in the presence of God thank God
[1:30:24] give your ti in the presence of God it's
[1:30:28] unlimited what God will do for
[1:30:36] you stay
[1:30:38] humble there are people when they are
[1:30:40] blessed they become
[1:30:46] arogant when arance
[1:30:49] comes arant before God just remember
[1:30:52] your family is going it's not even your
[1:30:55] your fellowship is with God will begin
[1:30:57] to say but your family is
[1:31:04] going and when your family
[1:31:07] goes sometime the amendment is very
[1:31:13] hard because God can save
[1:31:16] them God can save you but you will never
[1:31:19] have pleasant
[1:31:25] you may never have the original worship
[1:31:31] again she lost her husband lost her
[1:31:35] children God restored her but never gave
[1:31:39] her the
[1:31:43] pleasant instead of was Ruth
[1:31:49] gained is that
[1:31:51] amen lot lot
[1:31:54] when he left the real presence of God
[1:31:57] the family I'm talking about a
[1:31:59] family family that used to worship
[1:32:02] God the Bible tells us when they got
[1:32:06] money they became a problem for
[1:32:11] Abraham for them it was money they were
[1:32:15] Rich we can now manage our Affairs used
[1:32:18] to Ru us he used to control
[1:32:20] us and the moment they got off from the
[1:32:23] original
[1:32:25] princi slowly they
[1:32:27] know the B says the of
[1:32:34] Sodom of
[1:32:39] lot but it never Vex the wife
[1:32:44] Soul neither did itex the
[1:32:51] children is that amen because he's the
[1:32:55] head of the
[1:32:56] worship but he cannot be powerful when
[1:32:59] he's inom
[1:33:02] and so he remained suffering
[1:33:06] alone the little strength he got from
[1:33:09] Abraham not stand the strength and when
[1:33:12] the children
[1:33:15] went the Bible says talks about these
[1:33:18] two
[1:33:19] women Sarah sah and Mrs L the Bible says
[1:33:27] remember
[1:33:31] wife then it says also about
[1:33:35] sah as
[1:33:38] sah as sah obeyed her
[1:33:41] husband calling him
[1:33:44] Lord so should you the daughters of
[1:33:48] Sarah obey your
[1:33:50] husbands that's the compliment about sah
[1:33:53] is the compliment about about Mrs
[1:33:56] L
[1:33:58] remember L's wife what do you remember
[1:34:02] about L's wife when she left the prophet
[1:34:06] tells us she was she was now among all
[1:34:10] the women she was the leader of the
[1:34:12] women's
[1:34:15] clubs she was so popular having been
[1:34:19] with
[1:34:20] Abraham having been with Abraham
[1:34:24] been brought up well when she went there
[1:34:27] she was on top of the
[1:34:30] situation they respected her she was the
[1:34:33] head of the mother's Union she was the
[1:34:35] head of every
[1:34:36] society and she got a lot of
[1:34:39] riches such that when the Angels
[1:34:43] Came and they were saying this city is
[1:34:46] going to be destroyed the heart of M lot
[1:34:50] already gotten into the world
[1:34:53] world could not get out of
[1:34:56] her the second thing is that a mother
[1:34:59] will always remain a
[1:35:04] mother are we together so when the
[1:35:06] message
[1:35:08] came
[1:35:09] saying you tell your
[1:35:12] inlaws also to come out the Bible says
[1:35:17] when Lord told them those who married
[1:35:20] his
[1:35:21] daughters it was like a tail
[1:35:26] they just laugh at him so what
[1:35:29] happens their daughters with their son
[1:35:33] inw they never came in like it was the
[1:35:36] time of
[1:35:37] Noah for this ones they remain outside

[1:35:46] now being
[1:35:48] oppressed her riches were out her
[1:35:51] children were out her grand daughters

[1:36:10] grand daughter is behind her daughters
[1:36:13] are behind and as a mother her heart was
[1:36:17] behind so she started to
