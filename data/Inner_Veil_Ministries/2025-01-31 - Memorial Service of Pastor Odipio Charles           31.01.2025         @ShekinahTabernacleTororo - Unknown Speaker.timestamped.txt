[48:25] from malaba Kenya
[48:28] and if you can permit I want to give a
[48:32] personal
[48:33] testimony uh with the pastor
[48:36] diio Pastor diio was a personal friend
[48:41] we contacted a meeting with him here in
[48:45] the year 2018 December together with the
[48:49] pastor mlof Zambia and
[48:52] Pastor the late Pastor K kandon of
[48:57] Malawi and then the next meeting we had
[49:00] together with him was in Malawi that was
[49:03] 2019 April that was the last uh I think
[49:08] foreign trip we had together with him in
[49:11] Malawi and then um uh when he began
[49:15] being sick we were in touch and then uh
[49:20] uh When I Was preparing to go to
[49:23] Ethiopia in the
[49:25] year 20
[49:28] 2023
[49:30] March uh I had prayer items before
[49:34] God uh one of the prayer items I had was
[49:38] I wanted Pastor D to be healed and then
[49:41] I was praying I mean buia sorry M Uganda
[49:45] and then malaba Kenya so I thought he
[49:48] should leave more so that we can have
[49:51] such meetings together so I was praying
[49:55] and one of the prayer items as I've said
[49:57] before was that I wanted him healed and
[50:00] when I was talking to God uh about it
[50:04] and praying seriously before I went to
[50:07] preach in Ethiopia that year I
[50:12] received uh a communication from God and
[50:16] that communication was that odipo will
[50:22] rest in the Lord oripo will rest in the
[50:26] Lord
[50:27] oio raised in the Lord and then I as I
[50:31] was still wondering God gave me a
[50:33] scripture that I'm going to read to you
[50:36] uh in the Book of Revelation and that
[50:38] scripture you're sorry if you can
[50:50] [Music]
[50:53] permit yeah in the Book of Revelation
[50:55] chapter 14
[50:58] verse
[50:58] [Music]
[51:00] 13 it
[51:02] says and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[51:06] saying unto me right blessed are the
[51:09] dead which die in the Lord from
[51:13] henceforth yeah says the spirit that
[51:16] they may rest from their labors and
[51:20] their Works do follow
[51:22] them blessed be the name of the Lord
[51:25] when I receive this this I didn't know
[51:30] how to continue interceding but the Lord
[51:32] commanded me to go and to come and see
[51:35] Pastor I came and saw visited him at his
[51:38] home place uh and comforted him I told
[51:42] him God has spoken well of you and then
[51:44] he said he demanded I I tell him what
[51:47] God had told me I told him it was a nice
[51:51] nice message and then I told him I
[51:54] hinted to him that God gave me a good
[51:57] scripture concerning you and then he
[52:00] told me I would want to see that
[52:02] scripture I told him don't worry uh we
[52:05] will be talking and then after some time
[52:07] he forgot I thanked God he forgot
[52:09] because I could not read him this
[52:11] scripture while he was still there
[52:13] because now having known what God had
[52:16] for him and of course I knew he was
[52:19] going to rest but in the Lord I was
[52:22] happy myself that when he rests he rests
[52:25] in the Lord go bless you heart as we
[52:28] mourn let's know he has rested in the
[52:31] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord

[1:03:30] assembly and
[1:03:32] also a
[1:03:35] friend to our beloved Pastor CH
[1:03:40] Odio I came to know Pastor
[1:03:44] J some years
[1:03:49] back God led me to
[1:03:52] him I didn't know him that is he's a
[1:03:56] Minister but before I went to him I had
[1:04:00] received Christ in a Baptist
[1:04:05] Church so things didn't go well with
[1:04:08] me I left that
[1:04:11] place so one time two days before I met
[1:04:18] him I God gave me a scripture so as I
[1:04:22] was reading the Bible the scripture was
[1:04:25] in Revelation Chapter
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:35] 2 and when I went to him that road of
[1:04:39] baz Street there was a a
[1:04:44] library so I went to him and I asked
[1:04:48] him I've read this scripture but I'm not
[1:04:53] understanding could you help me
[1:04:56] when I look at you I see you as a
[1:04:59] servant of
[1:05:02] God we entered in the
[1:05:04] office then we read the Scripture it is
[1:05:07] in
[1:05:09] Revelation Chapter 2 from verse
[1:05:12] two
[1:05:14] says I Know Thy
[1:05:16] works and thy
[1:05:18] labor and I
[1:05:21] patience and how though
[1:05:26] cast Not
[1:05:28] Die Cast
[1:05:30] not bear them that are evil and though
[1:05:35] has tried them which they say they are
[1:05:39] Apostles and are
[1:05:41] not and has form them
[1:05:44] liars and has
[1:05:47] born and has
[1:05:50] patience for my
[1:05:53] sake has labored and has has not
[1:05:57] fainted
[1:05:59] neverless I have somewhat against
[1:06:04] thee because thou H has left thy First
[1:06:08] Love remember therefore from where th
[1:06:12] fallest and
[1:06:14] repent and do thy first works or else I
[1:06:20] will come unto thee
[1:06:22] quickly and remove the move th
[1:06:26] Candlestick out of this place except
[1:06:29] though
[1:06:31] repent blessed be the name of our Jesus
[1:06:34] Christ it was a hard message for
[1:06:38] me I can't explain how I was a feeling
[1:06:41] before I met him but when we read
[1:06:45] this we shared with him he spoke to me
[1:06:51] he prayed for
[1:06:52] me he told me just be right is your
[1:06:56] god and honestly from that
[1:06:59] day that's when he became my friend my
[1:07:03] spiritual father and he guided me and
[1:07:05] I've been with
[1:07:07] him blessed be the name of our Jesus
[1:07:11] Christ to talk much about him we shall
[1:07:14] take a full day
[1:07:16] here but I want you to
[1:07:19] accept that he was not only a
[1:07:22] minister he was beyond a minister
[1:07:26] he was not a father he was more than a
[1:07:30] father he was not a friend only but he
[1:07:33] was more than a
[1:07:35] friend because I could just imagine what
[1:07:38] life he went through the trials and one
[1:07:42] time I told him Pastor Charice this
[1:07:45] sickness is not your test it is a
[1:07:48] test to the church to the family and
[1:07:53] most especially us the people whom you
[1:07:56] have brought to Christ it was a test
[1:08:00] otherwise I thank you for those who have

[1:08:59] the family without Pastor Deo God bless
[1:09:02] you okay thank you so much brother now
[1:09:06] we are just to leave here I just wanted
[1:09:09] to hit this point that as Eagles
[1:09:13] sometimes are threatened by the enemy
[1:09:17] and the combined Harvester is always
[1:09:20] there to harvest but then as children of
[1:09:24] God sometimes we put boundaries I am
[1:09:27] borders you don't end where you end you
[1:09:31] don't want to cross the side it is my
[1:09:34] advice that M Pastor diio has been a
[1:09:39] pastor for all of us whoever I seated
[1:09:43] here because I remember from my
[1:09:46] childhood ever since and whoever went
[1:09:48] wherever you went but I know Pastor diio
[1:09:51] is all our pastor so don't create
[1:09:54] boundary is I am for this church I'm for
[1:09:57] this Fellowship you don't want to cross
[1:09:59] that side you hate the other one you
[1:10:02] don't talk to the other one you give
[1:10:04] fingers so I request that all this binds
[1:10:08] us together because we are aiming at one
[1:10:11] point thank you so much suppose you
[1:10:13] reach that point and you have against
[1:10:16] your brother something thank
[1:10:19] you
[1:10:22] amen I only want to say
[1:10:25] Pastor D has not been a pastor for
[1:10:27] tororo only has been a pastor for the
[1:10:31] entire body of Christ he has been our
[1:10:33] pastor so God bless you I want to invite
[1:10:37] uh now uh Pastor Kimo to come and give

[1:12:53] my name is Nelson
[1:12:55] K boy
[1:12:57] I'm station in Alor but in the body of
[1:13:03] Christ uh what we have come for is to
[1:13:07] say po to my sister the wife of brother
[1:13:12] oio I've known her for quite a long time
[1:13:16] although it has been quite some time
[1:13:19] also when we are busy in different
[1:13:22] places I think when I was here most was
[1:13:26] when Shalom I don't know whether Shalom
[1:13:28] you here yeah was a a young girl
[1:13:33] of almost half my size plus the other
[1:13:37] children now let me say that H I've
[1:13:41] known Pastoria for quite a long time
[1:13:45] from
[1:13:47] 1980s used to come to elor preached to
[1:13:50] us several times invited me to come here
[1:13:53] also several times
[1:13:55] times uh and I was here for quite some
[1:13:59] time I think while I while or when he
[1:14:03] invited me I went to quite a few
[1:14:05] churches and uh most of you know me not
[1:14:09] that I've run away but uh the Harvest is
[1:14:12] plenty and the laborers are few and that
[1:14:16] is what made us uh To Go in different
[1:14:19] directions but I still come to
[1:14:22] Uganda in fact last year I was in
[1:14:25] meetings in cang and almost all of
[1:14:28] Western almost uh crossing over to uh
[1:14:33] Rwanda but or the yeah Rwanda I think
[1:14:36] that is so we are still working together
[1:14:40] what I want to say that
[1:14:42] uh uh in those early '90s
[1:14:47] brother uh OIP was really a Budd to me
[1:14:51] he helped me to get into the ministry
[1:14:55] he is younger than me by age but older
[1:14:59] in the ministry he was an elder to me
[1:15:03] also and uh the first time that I left
[1:15:06] the country to go and preach out was
[1:15:09] when we went with him to simab in
[1:15:12] 1994 I guess all of you were born at
[1:15:14] that time and H your St actually held my
[1:15:19] hand I was carrying the books for him
[1:15:23] and we were in Zimbabwe for
[1:15:25] quite some time and uh we preach in many
[1:15:29] places in Zimbabwe he was always the
[1:15:32] first one to preach and then I'll copy I
[1:15:36] would copy what he has preach because I
[1:15:38] was still I was really a greenh horn in
[1:15:42] the
[1:15:43] ministry but uh we walk together that
[1:15:46] way until
[1:15:48] eventually he settled me in
[1:15:51] Tanzania and I went to almost every
[1:15:54] corner of
[1:15:55] Tanzania and him he went to Canada
[1:16:00] Europe and other
[1:16:01] places uh which actually agreed with
[1:16:04] this uh
[1:16:06] Ministry so when I was in
[1:16:10] Tanzania we used to
[1:16:12] communicate even with brother the late
[1:16:15] brother Peters and as many have said
[1:16:19] really was ahead of us and very useful
[1:16:21] in the ministry and I believe the work
[1:16:24] he did
[1:16:25] not many of us if we are given the same
[1:16:28] opportunity would do what he did and uh
[1:16:32] you know you you I can go to a place and
[1:16:36] take one year stumbling trying to say
[1:16:39] something or do something but Pastor D
[1:16:42] or somebody who would go somewhere and
[1:16:44] we would see the results
[1:16:46] immediately and maybe many not know him
[1:16:50] but he was a great minister of the
[1:16:53] gospel and I believe he has left behind
[1:16:56] not only his
[1:16:58] children but also his children in the
[1:17:01] Lord and great a number of his children
[1:17:05] as ministers and I
[1:17:08] believe that even though we shall miss
[1:17:11] him sorry sister because you're I mean
[1:17:14] you'll miss your
[1:17:16] husband uh because I I'm sure is
[1:17:19] somebody that you knew very
[1:17:21] well even more in the ministry than even
[1:17:24] as a friend and I believe he put a mark
[1:17:29] and this Mark will be an example to so
[1:17:32] many young
[1:17:33] ministers when I went to Kenya and
[1:17:36] concentrated there it's not that
[1:17:40] departing from here has made me to do a
[1:17:44] lot in the field or in
[1:17:48] the M there is so much to be done that
[1:17:52] even in your small corner you may think
[1:17:54] you have done a lot but what is
[1:17:56] remaining is quite a lot also so um I
[1:18:01] tried so many times to come pass by here
[1:18:04] but every time I would get information
[1:18:06] that he was in M Malo hospital and there
[1:18:09] was a time we stopped in uh Cala trying
[1:18:12] to think of how to get him we were told
[1:18:15] that uh he was a bit unwell in the
[1:18:18] hospital so after debating over some
[1:18:21] time we agreed that we let him rest
[1:18:27] but when all is said and done we thank
[1:18:29] God for such a man crossing our way he
[1:18:33] had traveled when we started a Ministry
[1:18:36] maybe the wife only knows he he was
[1:18:40] really one of
[1:18:42] the poorest I would
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:46] seea but in them AA I don't think any
[1:18:49] Minister can put on aala these days I
[1:18:52] think we are very proud people
[1:18:55] brother us
[1:18:56] put you
[1:19:02] know and he preached with all that
[1:19:06] little that he had he preached hiside
[1:19:09] out he used to come to LED take services
[1:19:14] for the whole weekend and in all in all
[1:19:19] he remained a friend and not my friend
[1:19:22] only but a friend of all all the
[1:19:25] Believers I think we had to give God a
[1:19:28] lot of thanks for such a life who came
[1:19:31] and was with us and he tried to be as
[1:19:35] humble as possible for the sake of the
[1:19:38] gospel God bless you very much the
[1:19:40] church here in the BL is called
[1:19:44] Shak and uh God bless you very much God
[1:19:47] keep you the family God bless you the
[1:19:50] children God bless you don't forget the
[1:19:53] god of your father
[1:19:55] and sister don't forget the code of your
[1:19:58] husband because God used to me in
[1:20:01] several ways to bless us and I still
[1:20:04] even remember it some month up to now
[1:20:07] from
[1:20:09] 1994 so I say so many of you are born
[1:20:13] and uh I wish I had time to talk to him
[1:20:16] and tell him I'll be faithful to the end
[1:20:19] to that Ministry which he started in Me
[1:20:22] God bless you very much and uh we may
[1:20:24] not come tomorrow because of other
[1:20:26] commitments but we say God bless you and
[1:20:29] God keep you and God Stand By You amen
[1:20:33] God bless you God bless you
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:37] Pastor oh I want to see him and look
[1:20:42] upon his
[1:20:44] face there to sing
[1:20:48] forever over his saving
[1:20:51] gra on the stre of Glory
[1:20:55] Glory let me LIF my
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:21:00] voice oh my last to Rejoice God bless
[1:21:06] you amen I wanted
[1:21:09] to because
[1:21:11] everyone has something to say about
[1:21:14] Pastor
[1:21:15] CH you know praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:18] because he has pointed many souls to
[1:21:22] Calvary so everyone has has something to
[1:21:25] say about him I believe don't you have
[1:21:28] amen but now with that there is a very
[1:21:32] very great friend has come in a little
[1:21:37] late uh I will just give him this
[1:21:40] opportunity before the pastor's
[1:21:42] representative comes uh I want to invite
[1:21:46] uh former
[1:21:48] mayor Pastor Pi John to come and say
[1:21:52] something 2 minutes please please two
[1:21:55] I request you stick to it God bless
[1:21:58] [Music]
[1:21:59] you thank you so much
[1:22:02] Pastor all of you dear
[1:22:05] moners I am called opio
[1:22:08] John I have served this area as a
[1:22:11] chairman
[1:22:12] L3 in the last time of office I was the
[1:22:16] mayor I met the
[1:22:19] late when I was campaigning for the
[1:22:22] office of chairman El
[1:22:26] with
[1:22:29] Robert it would give us a lot of advice
[1:22:33] but the one most thing that I
[1:22:36] remember I was not married when I was
[1:22:40] elected a chairman
[1:22:41] el3 but he told
[1:22:44] me be careful with that office and more
[1:22:49] especially when you are relating with
[1:22:50] the opposite
[1:22:52] sectors make sure you sit in an open or
[1:22:58] public
[1:23:03] place then when I became the
[1:23:07] mayor he kept coming to my
[1:23:10] office to still
[1:23:12] guide and
[1:23:15] advice for me both while I was a
[1:23:17] chairman and while I was a may I used to
[1:23:20] move to the community
[1:23:22] locally and I would always
[1:23:25] come to
[1:23:27] [Music]
[1:23:30] him I have not seen him for some time
[1:23:33] because when my election was mingled in
[1:23:36] the last
[1:23:38] election I decided to First stay
[1:23:43] away so that I give an opportunity to
[1:23:45] the person who got that
[1:23:49] chance because I believe it was God that
[1:23:52] said let me first get to off slightly
[1:23:55] say that people can see something
[1:24:00] here maybe God wanted to save me from
[1:24:04] something like he was my engineer when I
[1:24:07] was a chairman
[1:24:09] 3 he excused himself from the council
[1:24:12] because God wanted to save him from
[1:24:19] something life is like a train
[1:24:25] some people
[1:24:27] Bor some people
[1:24:32] disembark God himself
[1:24:37] knows the moment when he brings new
[1:24:40] people to to Bard and he knows when
[1:24:46] those who are supposed to dism back
[1:24:49] dear that is why
[1:24:52] sometimes for examp example if I do a
[1:24:55] good thing and people come to
[1:24:57] fight or when I see people fighting and
[1:25:00] struggling over things that we we got on
[1:25:04] this
[1:25:05] Earth sometimes I pause and simply look
[1:25:08] at them and wonder
[1:25:11] because all these things that we got
[1:25:14] here we are going to leave
[1:25:16] them you may want to own
[1:25:20] everything but when you are being buried
[1:25:22] they will all remain you see so why do
[1:25:25] we fight is like you have a
[1:25:29] bull that bull sometimes wants to fight
[1:25:33] all the
[1:25:34] others but you the owner you look at
[1:25:37] this bull and you know when you are
[1:25:38] going to slaughter it so God knows when
[1:25:41] he's going to call us off so those who
[1:25:43] are fighting those unnecessary
[1:25:45] struggling for almost one to have
[1:25:48] everything you want to fight others you
[1:25:50] are wasting your
[1:25:52] time God bless all of you I thank God so
[1:25:58] much that he enabled me to be around CU
[1:26:03] otherwise I would have missed this
[1:26:09] opportunity to see my
[1:26:12] friend
[1:26:16] off God bless all of you for God and my
[1:26:22] country thank you than you very
[1:26:25] much uh
[1:26:28] brother uh praise the name of the Lord I
[1:26:31] want to invite uh pastor's
[1:26:33] represent representative
[1:26:36] to speak on behalf of the pastors and
[1:26:40] then
[1:26:41] thereafter we shall have
[1:26:44] uh uh
[1:26:46] now to hear from the family praise the
[1:26:50] name of the Lord to hear from the
[1:26:52] children and
[1:26:54] the rest and praise the name of the Lord
[1:26:57] pastor's representative
[1:26:59] please
[1:27:02] uh God bless you
[1:27:05] Pastor as you come to speak on behalf of
[1:27:08] the pastors God bless you so much
[1:27:13] amen God bless you
[1:27:18] Brethren uh on behalf of my fellow
[1:27:22] pastors before I say anything maybe let
[1:27:25] me request all
[1:27:28] pastors who are here to stand up for
[1:27:33] recognition if you know you are a pastor
[1:27:35] you should not be
[1:27:39] ashamed God bless you so much in your
[1:27:43] capacities thank you for coming you may
[1:27:46] be
[1:27:46] se you know have been given a short time
[1:27:51] to say
[1:27:52] something well
[1:27:54] Pastor depio
[1:27:57] Charles has been a unique
[1:28:00] man I first met him in
[1:28:05] 1975 when we joined rooh High we were
[1:28:10] actually the Pioneer
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:15] students who admitted by the
[1:28:19] government that time he was still he was
[1:28:22] a preacher
[1:28:24] I was the tiniest
[1:28:28] man would see him preach and we would
[1:28:32] get scared because in
[1:28:35] 1975 to be God preaching
[1:28:38] salvation meant either imprisonment or
[1:28:44] death that time the government had only
[1:28:47] allowed four religions Orthodox
[1:28:51] Catholicism Anglican and then
[1:28:56] Islam would watch him preach fearlessly
[1:29:00] as a small
[1:29:03] man after that after we parted our ways
[1:29:07] the last the next meeting was in
[1:29:12] 1987 when we met now in the
[1:29:17] message at that
[1:29:20] time there was a library in Kenya
[1:29:24] under the late pastor
[1:29:29] oena and I was the one
[1:29:32] responsible of smuggling book message
[1:29:35] books from Kenya Cross to Uganda by head
[1:29:40] and sometimes by
[1:29:43] bicycle that was a wonderful
[1:29:47] time that's when I knew that ripio
[1:29:49] Charles was a a real man of God
[1:29:54] the third incident again was in
[1:29:57] 1990 you know there was biting poverty
[1:30:00] in
[1:30:01] Uganda and I decided to go to campala to
[1:30:05] look for a job and I got a
[1:30:08] job on my return back to pick my family
[1:30:12] I got a message from Brother Charles
[1:30:15] calling me to come and see him and when
[1:30:17] I came he narrated to me a
[1:30:21] story of the prophet
[1:30:26] Jonah after giving me a story I I
[1:30:29] enjoyed the story so much then he turned
[1:30:31] and told me you are
[1:30:35] Jonah I asked him what what have I done
[1:30:38] he said you are the Lord showed me when
[1:30:41] you are
[1:30:42] running to
[1:30:45] cala said God has chosen you to be a
[1:30:49] pastor in that place I said but we have
[1:30:52] brother Seto he said go has removed set
[1:30:56] already I went back a Broken Man hearted
[1:30:59] man because looking at my family the
[1:31:03] poverty the needs it was too much but I
[1:31:06] sat back I listened to him who was I to
[1:31:10] disobey the voice of
[1:31:13] God uh let me say something again about
[1:31:17] how brother Charles was
[1:31:20] special we received some visitors from
[1:31:23] westca
[1:31:24] Africa some two brothers and we had a
[1:31:29] meeting at Elon
[1:31:32] view those people gave us gave gave him
[1:31:36] a proposal that if he can abandon what
[1:31:39] was
[1:31:40] preaching and take their
[1:31:44] version of taking the
[1:31:46] message would forget of
[1:31:49] poverty I remember he said never we
[1:31:53] cannot do that we cannot sell the
[1:31:55] truth for a piece of
[1:31:59] bread that proves to
[1:32:02] you that he was a man of
[1:32:09] integrity fast forward on 27th of
[1:32:12] November
[1:32:13] 2024 when I paid him a visit with
[1:32:16] brother
[1:32:17] Julius we had a memorable time we were
[1:32:22] sharing those old days
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:25] he asked me how old are
[1:32:27] you I told him I was
[1:32:31] 68 and I asked him what about you how
[1:32:34] old are you brother he told me I don't
[1:32:37] know my age said maybe my
[1:32:42] wife knows then the sister came
[1:32:46] in and reminded him the day he was born
[1:32:52] then I said oh brother I'm older than
[1:32:55] you
[1:32:57] by two
[1:33:01] months then that was when he informed us
[1:33:04] that there will be meetings here on the
[1:33:07] 7th and on that 7th when we were here
[1:33:10] after the service he came here and stood
[1:33:14] and he
[1:33:15] [Music]
[1:33:17] said telling the church to
[1:33:21] respect every minister
[1:33:24] who will come to this
[1:33:26] place those words stuck to me and on the
[1:33:30] way back I was telling brother Julius
[1:33:32] you know brother
[1:33:33] Julius the
[1:33:35] brother though he has lost
[1:33:38] memory what he said there carries a lot
[1:33:43] of
[1:33:45] weight I went back home
[1:33:49] sat and thought so much about those
[1:33:52] words that statement
[1:33:55] and then finally I came
[1:33:57] to the Gospel of John
[1:34:00] chapter
[1:34:05] 15 verse
[1:34:08] 11 you will read at your own time it was
[1:34:12] a command from the Lord to love one
[1:34:17] another you see Brethren brother
[1:34:21] Charles pastored most of us
[1:34:24] when I came from Kenya he actually
[1:34:26] became my
[1:34:28] pastor and a
[1:34:30] [Music]
[1:34:35] mentor
[1:34:38] today as pastors we are meeting here he
[1:34:42] has gathered us
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:44] together is the one who has called for
[1:34:46] this
[1:34:48] meeting that we should meet
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:55] you know there may be so many
[1:34:58] things that have kept some of us
[1:35:02] apart but let us remind
[1:35:05] ourselves that that is the work of the
[1:35:10] devil there is one thing I'm sure
[1:35:14] of that it takes only
[1:35:18] love to put us in that place we bre that
[1:35:24] we are going
[1:35:26] to my prayer is as ministers let us
[1:35:31] drop all our
[1:35:35] ODS and recognize one
[1:35:37] [Music]
[1:35:39] another that in a
[1:35:41] house there are diverse
[1:35:44] vessels you may be having a bigger Faith
[1:35:48] than
[1:35:49] Aura you may be having a bigger
[1:35:52] congregation than Aur
[1:35:55] you may be able to bring a message in
[1:35:57] such a tremendous
[1:35:59] way that everybody listener gets worked
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:05] up but let us not forget that in that
[1:36:09] very
[1:36:10] house there is also a
[1:36:16] pot break for you maybe
[1:36:20] metal my last word is brother Bram
[1:36:24] talked of one
[1:36:26] Abraham would make about 10
[1:36:30] loots the faith of Abraham was greater
[1:36:33] than the faith of who lot and brother
[1:36:35] Braham said if you are a pastor of five
[1:36:40] souls in the sight of
[1:36:43] God you are not
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:46] less than that Pastor who has a
[1:36:50] Congregation of 1,000 people
[1:36:54] before God you are a
[1:36:57] Shepherd if you have been avoiding
[1:37:00] abura let us meet and
[1:37:03] say from today my
[1:37:06] brother you are my brother if you avoid
[1:37:10] to greet me you are still my brother and
[1:37:14] there is one thing that I will request
[1:37:16] as fellow pastors to
[1:37:19] remember sister chario she has been a
[1:37:22] mother to all of
[1:37:25] us she cooked for all of
[1:37:28] us she served all of us water for

[1:42:09] Church we're here
[1:42:13] to as as was saying we're here to
[1:42:17] celebrate life of Pastor Charles
[1:42:23] who is also our
[1:42:25] father
[1:42:29] biologically there is a lot which can be
[1:42:32] say about him it's
[1:42:36] not it's not something you can
[1:42:39] say
[1:42:40] within a short frame of
[1:42:44] [Music]
[1:42:46] time all in
[1:42:48] all dad was a a strong personality
[1:42:55] he was a farm
[1:42:57] man and you don't to him especially when
[1:43:00] he knows what he's
[1:43:02] saying is right and grounded in the
[1:43:06] message you'll never TOS him I don't I
[1:43:10] don't care how much scientific proof you
[1:43:12] will bring or whatever you will not toss
[1:43:17] him and that was a firm base for all of
[1:43:23] us especially in the Christian
[1:43:28] walk personally we have you've heard of
[1:43:31] stories
[1:43:33] of people wanting to come and bribe him
[1:43:36] to bring in other
[1:43:38] things we W witnessed it
[1:43:43] personally
[1:43:45] uh even if to some of them would make
[1:43:48] him sick like I remember
[1:43:51] one time
[1:43:54] after heed argument the
[1:43:56] following that he was in hospital
[1:43:59] pressures and
[1:44:03] etc for because of some people wanting
[1:44:07] to allow him to preach a false
[1:44:12] Doctrine and he gains
[1:44:14] financial
[1:44:16] wealth that and I witnessed it myself
[1:44:20] but he
[1:44:22] refused and that one struck a good
[1:44:25] seed which is a
[1:44:29] legacy by God's grace we have to
[1:44:33] keep
[1:44:37] hallelu another
[1:44:40] thing he
[1:44:42] was he led by example he's not a person
[1:44:46] who could
[1:44:46] [Music]
[1:44:48] pretend you know when when a person is
[1:44:51] pretending you just wait for them in
[1:44:54] their lonely hours
[1:44:56] or or whatever but I I watched daddy
[1:45:01] though he was he would not know
[1:45:02] sometimes but we watched
[1:45:06] him even out of sleep or you see his
[1:45:10] kind of maring
[1:45:14] scriptures or something when he was
[1:45:18] sick many
[1:45:20] times a brother Maybe come to visit him
[1:45:25] and of course maybe in the art of trying
[1:45:27] to divert him from his condition you
[1:45:29] begin talking other things he just does
[1:45:32] off but when you begin preaching the
[1:45:35] word of God or sharing a testimony you
[1:45:37] see him waking
[1:45:39] up or singing a song from his
[1:45:43] sleep I I used to watch him but from far
[1:45:46] I would
[1:45:47] not I would watch him from far but not
[1:45:49] talk anything and I was wondering
[1:45:54] he's only interested in God things but
[1:45:57] other things is dozing off or it doesn't
[1:45:59] show any interest when you was
[1:46:03] sick whatever Hot Topic you would bring
[1:46:06] maybe things
[1:46:08] like news current events as long as he
[1:46:13] knew would help him in the
[1:46:16] message there he would follow up but if
[1:46:19] you bring in any funny music or you just
[1:46:22] see him losing interest
[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:27] and when he was sick in hospital in
[1:46:30] mulago of course sometimes he not
[1:46:32] himself you know sometimes when a person
[1:46:34] is not himself you you speak out exactly
[1:46:38] who you
[1:46:40] are if you a terrorist you will begin
[1:46:44] speaking words of I will blast you with
[1:46:47] bombs here if you have ever been a
[1:46:49] terrorist when you're going through
[1:46:51] those sick hours
[1:46:53] but the words I would hear from Daddy
[1:46:55] was
[1:46:57] Hallelujah take what you have but give
[1:46:59] me scriptures such things now that one
[1:47:03] is not somebody who is
[1:47:04] pretending that one is a genuine person
[1:47:07] and he he didn't only do it once he did
[1:47:09] it many
[1:47:11] times so for
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:16] me that is a fir
[1:47:19] story which I think
[1:47:23] we have to preserve that
[1:47:27] Legacy God bless
[1:47:38] you okay God bless
[1:47:41] you I believe all of us are creation of
[1:47:45] God so I can call you Sons and Daughters
[1:47:50] of God
[1:47:53] otherwise I appreciate your
[1:47:55] coming I'm the Third born Benjamin
[1:48:00] odipo and what I can say humbly about my
[1:48:05] father is that uh he has been
[1:48:10] both a physical and spiritual father in
[1:48:13] my
[1:48:15] life and one thing that would really
[1:48:19] attract my
[1:48:21] attention was that
[1:48:23] in
[1:48:24] spite of his
[1:48:27] influence and uh the great ministry that
[1:48:30] he
[1:48:31] had is someone who would
[1:48:34] even encourage the one who is at the
[1:48:38] bottom who is still
[1:48:40] Rising he would show you so much
[1:48:43] respect and
[1:48:46] encouragement uh actually he's the one
[1:48:49] who has been my mentor
[1:48:53] when I was a minister of course I'm a
[1:48:55] minister of the Gospel but of course not
[1:48:58] an old minister of the Gospel I'm still
[1:49:01] I'm still new in the
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:06] field uh God bless you
[1:49:09] Pastor and uh I feel so sad that he went
[1:49:13] early do was doing a very good job in my
[1:49:17] life but uh whenever I would
[1:49:20] preach he would always encourage me and
[1:49:25] respect the sermons I would
[1:49:27] Minister so that one would really humble
[1:49:30] me and I would say if with my small
[1:49:34] Ministry this kind of Pastor can speak
[1:49:37] this concerning my life
[1:49:40] then I think that's the right path I
[1:49:43] have to
[1:49:44] follow you don't be someone who wants to
[1:49:47] be a show off in
[1:49:50] Ministry but like
[1:49:53] our pastor was
[1:49:56] saying you may be what you may be a leaf
[1:49:59] you may be a branch or you may be a
[1:50:02] root but you all a part of the tree amen
[1:50:07] and there's no one who is greater than
[1:50:09] the
[1:50:10] other so God bless you all and continue
[1:50:14] praying for
[1:50:15] [Music]
[1:50:18] us God bless you um Moses the youngest
[1:50:23] son I will just say a few things about
[1:50:26] Dad uh I remember some of his sermons he
[1:50:30] believed in
[1:50:32] Simplicity and he always thought all is
[1:50:35] well no matter the
[1:50:38] situation and he was uh he was faithful
[1:50:41] to God was a St
[1:50:43] Christian and I think he was a m to many
[1:50:47] people may his soul rest in glory
[1:50:51] [Music]
[1:50:58] [Music]
[1:51:00] the Lord bless you
[1:51:01] all um Joseph adipo the fourth
[1:51:07] born um these are hard times to speak
[1:51:11] because
[1:51:12] uh the pain of losing him is
[1:51:16] one that we cannot bear I like to say
[1:51:21] what Comforts us
[1:51:23] from the testimonies when he's departing
[1:51:26] and his life he has
[1:51:28] lived is that he's in
[1:51:32] glory and if we are faithful till the
[1:51:35] end shall meet
[1:51:39] him I like to say he he lived a
[1:51:41] Christian Life most importantly about
[1:51:44] that one thing I recognize with him is
[1:51:49] even when he had
[1:51:52] external battles you could not know his
[1:51:55] enemies he was someone who never wanted
[1:51:58] you to talk ill about anyone
[1:52:02] else you know as a child sometimes you
[1:52:04] witness s circumstances in life and you
[1:52:08] may M here and there that he always
[1:52:10] wanted us to be
[1:52:12] peaceful he always wanted us to love
[1:52:15] each and everyone like Jesus said do
[1:52:19] good he also had father in love and
[1:52:24] according to the scriptures the Bible
[1:52:26] says Those whom I love I
[1:52:29] Chas so he was a strict father he did
[1:52:34] not want us to go the wrong way he
[1:52:37] always wanted us to be
[1:52:40] right and I know myself personally
[1:52:44] growing
[1:52:46] up I
[1:52:48] was on the stubborn
[1:52:51] side but
[1:52:54] I always tell myself if I did not have
[1:52:57] him as a
[1:52:58] father maybe I would have been worse
[1:53:02] than I was but he was
[1:53:04] strict he cared for us he sacrific the
[1:53:08] Lord for our
[1:53:10] lives and where we are today it's
[1:53:13] because of him so thank you all for
[1:53:16] coming here to celebrate him I like to
[1:53:19] say that his life has left a footprint

[2:01:30] father more than a pastor and more than
[2:01:34] everything I am going to say my own
[2:01:38] personal uh Memorial of
[2:01:41] him the first time I saw him when I met
[2:01:46] him my Fondest Memories of him I think
[2:01:50] should be about 9
[2:01:52] [Music]
[2:01:54] 1989 and we used to live at g Road and
[2:02:00] he used to come and stay at our home
[2:02:02] whenever he would have when he was
[2:02:05] moving West or when he was moving out of
[2:02:07] the country he would stay at our
[2:02:10] home uh it was the first time when I got
[2:02:14] to know him uh as a little child I was
[2:02:18] probably I don't even remember that
[2:02:20] could have been around
[2:02:23] maybe
[2:02:24] P maybe P4 I don't remember
[2:02:28] so what I recall is that whenever he
[2:02:32] would come home we used to have
[2:02:34] different names for different people
[2:02:36] would refer to a person without you
[2:02:39] knowing who the person is we used to
[2:02:41] have a people called the uncle with
[2:02:44] beards the uncle with specs but we used
[2:02:48] to know him as uncle or de for some
[2:02:50] strange reason so when he comes we would
[2:02:54] go and play with him the whole night in
[2:02:56] his bed he would not sleep would be with
[2:03:01] him until late until our parents Chas us
[2:03:04] out when I look back it
[2:03:09] appears I have a picture of him of open
[2:03:15] love open love for everybody I want to
[2:03:18] show you how it worked
[2:03:22] in 20 in
[2:03:25] 1993 when I joined senior one at St
[2:03:28] Peter's College tororo the church was in
[2:03:31] Toro
[2:03:33] girls I would walk from St Peters if you
[2:03:36] know where it is I was possibly 12 years
[2:03:40] I would walk from that place up to Toro
[2:03:45] girls every
[2:03:47] Sunday uh how did it happen when I the
[2:03:50] memories of 19
[2:03:53] 1989 I heard that he was a pastor here
[2:03:56] so I looked for
[2:03:58] him and when I reach church he would
[2:04:01] leave everybody he would pay I saw him
[2:04:04] pay attention to every person that was
[2:04:06] in church I used to wonder how he would
[2:04:09] do it and me at my age he would call me
[2:04:14] by name and he would ask me when are you
[2:04:17] going let's go home and I was not saved
[2:04:21] I remained going to that church for 5
[2:04:24] years without getting saved but I was
[2:04:26] going to
[2:04:27] church can you imagine I was moving long
[2:04:31] distance to church without getting
[2:04:35] saved the time when I went to get saved
[2:04:38] the church had something had happened so
[2:04:41] I left the church I went back to
[2:04:43] scripture Union I think there was a new
[2:04:45] doctor that came so the pastor I asked
[2:04:47] the pastor what happened I realized he
[2:04:49] was not happy with what was going on he
[2:04:53] was a man of
[2:04:55] Peace he always loved place of
[2:04:59] Peace he
[2:05:02] loved he hated
[2:05:04] Discord I don't know where that thing
[2:05:06] came from I was told it was a new
[2:05:08] doctrine of shouting and things
[2:05:12] so after some time I rejoined with him
[2:05:16] again and I realized that the church was
[2:05:19] peaceful again
[2:05:22] now my memories of him in
[2:05:26] 1989 when I tried to get any other I
[2:05:29] remember a person holding his Bible in
[2:05:32] one hand and he used to have a
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:36] briefcase and he was either head he was
[2:05:38] always going somewhere to preach and I
[2:05:41] remember always escorting him from the
[2:05:43] house with his I would hold the Bible
[2:05:46] and give it to him at the
[2:05:49] gate I don't know why those kind of
[2:05:52] memories remained with
[2:05:54] me now let me tell you he didn't leave
[2:05:58] me he continue to visit me even when I
[2:06:01] was
[2:06:02] working that's just to show you who this
[2:06:05] person
[2:06:07] is even when I got to work he came and
[2:06:11] visited me at my
[2:06:13] house then he looked at the house then
[2:06:16] he said oh this is very nice only one
[2:06:20] thing is missing in this house
[2:06:22] house you can imagine what it
[2:06:26] is then it didn't take
[2:06:30] long it was now when he spoke like
[2:06:33] that I think a year later he got to know
[2:06:37] that I was going to bring that thing
[2:06:40] that was missing in my
[2:06:43] house I was
[2:06:45] working I was having a house I was
[2:06:50] having almost what need but one thing
[2:06:54] [Music]
[2:06:55] was I don't know what it
[2:06:58] was of course at the end of the day I
[2:07:03] turned
[2:07:04] out as they said earlier on a son-in-law
[2:07:09] but I must say for me I think I'm a son
[2:07:13] in love to
[2:07:17] him he loved
[2:07:20] me I had him in my
[2:07:22] house I think we've been for over 4
[2:07:26] years
[2:07:28] while he was
[2:07:30] [Music]
[2:07:33] battling we used to talk as
[2:07:37] men a lot of
[2:07:40] things the things he would tell
[2:07:43] me not to make my brothers jealous I
[2:07:47] don't think he discussed them with his
[2:07:49] children
[2:07:53] I think he loved many people who came
[2:07:58] around him just like the way he loved
[2:08:00] his family I I don't know how that
[2:08:03] happens but I experienced
[2:08:06] it I believe he was a man on a
[2:08:11] mission and he has accomplished his
[2:08:15] mission he's in a good
[2:08:18] place the Lord has welcomed him
[2:08:22] he has done his work very well I was
[2:08:25] talking with my father and my father
[2:08:28] told me that every place in this country
[2:08:33] has his
[2:08:34] footprint of
[2:08:36] work yesterday I was talking to somebody
[2:08:39] he called me and told me he could not
[2:08:41] make it but he told
[2:08:44] me that he has never seen actually after
[2:08:49] talking about him he talked about my
[2:08:51] mom-in-law and said he doesn't think
[2:08:53] there is a woman like that in the whole
[2:08:55] world that is only one I said why he
[2:09:00] said that she spent her time taking care
[2:09:04] of other people so much more than even
[2:09:06] her own
[2:09:08] family that's
[2:09:11] why I
[2:09:13] agree we must see a widow in the proper
[2:09:17] perspective and we should not leave a WI
[2:09:21] Widow
[2:09:23] alone the Widow belongs to us we ate all
[2:09:28] her
[2:09:29] food we we did everything in her house
[2:09:33] if you see what she lacks it's because
[2:09:35] we took
[2:09:36] it we took whatever she lacks now we
[2:09:41] took
[2:09:42] it so it is time to pay back it's time
[2:09:48] to pay back it's time to return home we
[2:09:52] go back home

[2:15:17] [Music]
[2:15:19] primary uh
[2:15:22] but of course uh I was still
[2:15:24] young I did not understand but he could
[2:15:27] go to schools and preach into some
[2:15:31] schools and I could see him lining up
[2:15:34] all the seven Church Ages which I have
[2:15:36] never had in my life
[2:15:39] before
[2:15:41] uh but uh that's when I started hearing
[2:15:44] about this
[2:15:46] message Pastor uh brother our late now
[2:15:50] char
[2:15:52] I wanted just give him the
[2:15:55] brief uh
[2:15:59] background he was
[2:16:02] born on 21st January
[2:16:07] 1957 in West
[2:16:11] Nile West
[2:16:13] Nile is formerly it was AR
[2:16:18] District but now
[2:16:22] the place the location is in zumbo
[2:16:27] District was born in zumbo District in a
[2:16:31] village called araka
[2:16:35] Village and
[2:16:37] uh that's when he was born from that
[2:16:42] Village and I can say biologically the
[2:16:45] home district is called zumbo
[2:16:48] District that's why our ancestro home is
[2:16:52] and that's why our dad also was
[2:16:56] buried our father is called L Gideon
[2:17:01] amango he
[2:17:04] died and he was a
[2:17:07] lerer is a a preacher in Protestant
[2:17:12] church with the you tell me he had the
[2:17:15] first letter second letter third letter
[2:17:18] so he's El in Protestant church
[2:17:23] [Music]
[2:17:25] and when he became a l reader my dad
[2:17:30] because uh he's my biological
[2:17:34] brother and uh his wife that's our
[2:17:38] mother biological mother is called late
[2:17:41] Rebecca at
[2:17:43] tomaru these are
[2:17:46] Protestants and uh the biological
[2:17:50] Brothers of chipio were the ones our
[2:17:53] daddy had six boys two girls and those
[2:17:58] are eight
[2:18:00] children but out of
[2:18:04] this
[2:18:06] uh three boys died including
[2:18:10] himself then one of our sister also
[2:18:14] [Music]
[2:18:15] died and
[2:18:18] um we have remained three boys one
[2:18:22] girl now Pastor chario my biological
[2:18:27] [Music]
[2:18:28] brother he started his primary
[2:18:33] education in masindi
[2:18:36] District but I wanted to bring down how
[2:18:39] did he come to M from West
[2:18:43] Nile the people in
[2:18:46] buoro we had our tribes almost two subc
[2:18:50] count
[2:18:52] in Marini
[2:18:53] District our trib mates who speak local
[2:18:57] language so they wanted a preacher who
[2:19:01] could come and preach them in the local
[2:19:04] language
[2:19:06] so the The Boro people the Protestants
[2:19:11] especially they wrote to ROR
[2:19:14] dasis to request a preacher from West
[2:19:18] Nile to come and preach
[2:19:21] the word of God to buoro to the local
[2:19:25] people and the vote landed on my
[2:19:30] dad so they wrote a letter to my dad
[2:19:33] that is Gideon
[2:19:35] amango was a preaching
[2:19:37] Protestant they say you have been chosen
[2:19:41] to go as a missionary Ino from West n to
[2:19:45] buoro as a preacher to your people to
[2:19:49] preach in the local language
[2:19:52] my dad refused he said he can't go
[2:19:56] Boro they gave him another
[2:20:00] scripture that when Jonah refused to go
[2:20:03] to NV what happened to
[2:20:08] him that scripture hit him up and told
[2:20:12] his wife that's our mom that let us go
[2:20:17] because it's the work of God
[2:20:20] then they had to travel from West
[2:20:23] Nile together with his wife they travel
[2:20:27] through Lake
[2:20:28] Albert using a
[2:20:31] ship and crossed the lake up
[2:20:35] to buoro in a village called
[2:20:41] Nanton and it's from
[2:20:44] there that uh my dad preached the word
[2:20:48] of God to many villages and and people
[2:20:51] opened many churches and from there that
[2:20:55] also Char shipo started his primary
[2:21:02] education late Charles oio started his
[2:21:05] primary education in
[2:21:06] 1968 he completed in
[2:21:10] 1974
[2:21:11] and he passed highly in grade one and
[2:21:15] was admitted in cabala s that is masindi
[2:21:19] district and his place later was
[2:21:22] replaced by rich man who brought his own
[2:21:25] son in his place then our elder brother
[2:21:29] the first born called Mata
[2:21:33] Alex is is there that's the first
[2:21:38] born uh of
[2:21:40] chario he was a clerical officer by then
[2:21:44] he was working here in toroto hospital
[2:21:48] he had to bring Charles oio in toroto
[2:21:51] and fix him in Rock High SS that's why
[2:21:56] he
[2:21:57] started uh studying and uh it's from
[2:22:02] there that he believed this message he
[2:22:05] got this message when it was already in
[2:22:09] toroto and
[2:22:13] um when his elder brother blasto was
[2:22:16] transferred to to another place in
[2:22:23] KAG then that's when he left charp he
[2:22:26] said let us go together said no I have
[2:22:28] my people near here I can stay with them
[2:22:31] you can go to kagadi me let me remain in
[2:22:33] too and started from there he could
[2:22:35] preach in different places as you have
[2:22:37] the
[2:22:38] testimonies and uh he remained here
[2:22:42] eventually uh he become the pastor here
[2:22:46] in tororo he completed his uh education
[2:22:49] from here
[2:22:51] and he started also becoming a pastor in
[2:22:53] this
[2:22:54] place because during his lifetime he has
[2:22:57] been preaching
[2:23:02] throughout
[2:23:04] um after completing his education he
[2:23:07] opened up
[2:23:10] churches church called salom Tabernacle
[2:23:14] thereafter
[2:23:16] uh I started another chart later which
[2:23:20] is called
[2:23:23] seina
[2:23:24] assemblies he has been an elder and
[2:23:28] every very active Pastor in the ministry
[2:23:31] he was among the first pastors who
[2:23:33] believed this message and traveled from
[2:23:37] missionary work preaching in Uganda and
[2:23:40] outside countries mentioned but few many
[2:23:43] people believed his ministry and
[2:23:46] churches were opened in different
[2:23:49] places uh
[2:23:51] later because I'm to be very brief now
[2:23:54] later became
[2:23:55] sick and had a long time
[2:23:59] sickness
[2:24:01] uh
[2:24:02] until he passed on but I like to
[2:24:07] appreciate all those who
[2:24:11] participated supporting him in the
[2:24:14] ministry supporting him in the
[2:24:18] sickness um and
[2:24:21] also in
[2:24:24] transport physically
[2:24:27] spiritually and
[2:24:29] also
[2:24:31] uh in many things that had made him to
[2:24:35] reach up this moment of time on behalf
[2:24:37] of the family members of our late father
[2:24:41] Gideon amango that is our late dad I
[2:24:45] also like to thank him that also what he
[2:24:47] participated in the faith of my D who
[2:24:50] believed the message at the last
[2:24:54] moment and he was baptized in tororo
[2:24:58] here when he was already a Protestant
[2:25:01] preacher then he believed the message he
[2:25:04] was baptized when he was
[2:25:06] baptized the Protestant says your daddy
[2:25:09] is our dadd is
[2:25:11] lost but my daddy could say one thing
[2:25:15] what you eat enters your stomach so what
[2:25:19] have received is assisting me but not
[2:25:23] you people who said I've joined the
[2:25:24] ministry of my children so that's how we
[2:25:28] could always speak like that
[2:25:31] and our families were Christians and
[2:25:35] look like

[2:29:59] because I know him more than
[2:30:13] everybody
[2:30:15] Charice has been really a husband
[2:30:20] and more than a
[2:30:22] husband he got me when I had lost my
[2:30:26] father when I was
[2:30:30] young
[2:30:32] but he
[2:30:34] played the part of a
[2:30:38] father he loved me with all his
[2:30:42] life the first thing he would call
[2:30:45] whenever he reaches at home he would say
[2:30:49] wa me
[2:30:51] and all his life even when he was he has
[2:30:54] been my
[2:30:55] example I am what I am because of
[2:31:00] him I'm a kind
[2:31:08] lady a masterful
[2:31:11] lady true a simple a simple
[2:31:17] lady a lovely lady
[2:31:22] and I'm not a bitter
[2:31:26] person I don't hold
[2:31:28] [Music]
[2:31:29] bitterness just because I saw my husband
[2:31:33] leave
[2:31:35] it he does not allow us to sit and
[2:31:39] discuss about
[2:31:42] somebody even when he's his
[2:31:45] enemy and even when things are
[2:31:48] hard whenever you would ask him what are
[2:31:52] we going to do he would always say don't
[2:31:57] you trust
[2:31:58] God God will do it amen throughout all
[2:32:04] his this
[2:32:07] sickness I we never heard him
[2:32:12] complain even asking God why am I sick
[2:32:17] or why am I going through this
[2:32:20] P he has been a lovely
[2:32:23] person he loves
[2:32:27] everybody sometimes he could tell
[2:32:30] me he comes late at night and tells me I
[2:32:35] met a drunkard staggering on the way I
[2:32:39] had to hold him his hand and help
[2:32:44] him to escort
[2:32:47] him he lived that really a life which
[2:32:50] was
[2:32:53] challenging even but before he got sick
[2:32:57] he told me he Dreamed a
[2:32:59] Dream he had crossed
[2:33:02] over and that land was very
[2:33:06] beautiful and when he looked at
[2:33:09] himself he found he was full of
[2:33:13] stars he did not want to come back but
[2:33:17] he was told to come back
[2:33:21] he has been a great friend for
[2:33:24] me he has been encouraging
[2:33:27] me and when even things are
[2:33:30] hard I would look at him I say but this
[2:33:34] one is also a human being like
[2:33:36] me but if he can bear and does not
[2:33:41] complain who am I to
[2:33:44] complain he has been my example my
[2:33:47] friend
[2:33:50] does not talk bad about
[2:33:53] me I don't think anybody has ever had
[2:33:57] him complain about me he has always
[2:34:01] called me a good
[2:34:05] wife so he has loved my
[2:34:09] people with all his heart Charles loves
[2:34:16] everybody he really a person of love and
[2:34:20] patience I could testify he would be a
[2:34:23] very rich
[2:34:25] man because he would come and tell me
[2:34:28] what people promises him if he only
[2:34:32] believed the
[2:34:33] way but he would not do
[2:34:38] that we went through
[2:34:42] hardship but he will
[2:34:44] toate and still love his
[2:34:47] God he loved his
[2:34:50] children his
[2:34:52] family we cannot say that he loved this
[2:34:55] child more than the other one he loved
[2:34:59] them the same he loved us he wished the
[2:35:03] best for
[2:35:04] us only didn't have much but sacrificed
[2:35:08] the little heart for
[2:35:11] us there is even a
[2:35:14] time he could put one pair of shoe
[2:35:19] for a long time but to see his
[2:35:22] family okay he allowed the children to
[2:35:26] take the courses they want whether they
[2:35:29] are
[2:35:30] expensive he did not want toct to
[2:35:33] dictate for them that maybe does not
[2:35:36] have
[2:35:37] much he will
[2:35:40] struggle to pay the school fees yet he
[2:35:44] had friends who were promising
[2:35:46] him even one time he told me one
[2:35:50] showed him many good
[2:35:54] cars told him your car is old if you
[2:35:58] only believe the way he believes
[2:36:02] allows he would have the best car showed
[2:36:07] him many types of nice
[2:36:10] cars but my husband never did
[2:36:14] that at home everybody a v comes he will
[2:36:19] not go want anybody to go without
[2:36:21] testing
[2:36:23] anything that one I knew it even because
[2:36:27] when the visitor is wanting to say I'm
[2:36:30] going he will say you wait they are
[2:36:33] preparing something for you even without
[2:36:36] knowing whether I'm prepared all things
[2:36:39] are there to
[2:36:41] prepare but I also
[2:36:44] L I knew that V would not go until I S
[2:36:50] because he will hold him we have been
[2:36:55] together it is
[2:36:57] painful that's why you see me
[2:37:00] cry because he's a great friend he
[2:37:04] became my
[2:37:05] father became my twin
[2:37:08] brother he became everything to
[2:37:12] me I miss
[2:37:14] him but God is Grace because he has been
[2:37:18] even telling people I would love to go
[2:37:23] but I fear to leave my wife because he
[2:37:27] knew the closeness we
[2:37:31] had I thank God he has left an
[2:37:35] example because even when we married the
[2:37:38] first thing he did to me is to introduce
[2:37:42] me to read the
[2:37:44] Bible would read the Bible every
[2:37:47] day and even in his sickness has not
[2:37:50] left that the morning when he would call
[2:37:54] go and call him he says I'm still
[2:37:56] [Music]
[2:37:58] praying at night he made sure we always
[2:38:01] have a family
[2:38:06] prayer it has been a
[2:38:09] challenge one time even a certain lady
[2:38:12] came at the
[2:38:14] gate and he told
[2:38:16] me is this a the home of
[2:38:20] Pastor I said which Pastor do you
[2:38:24] want he just told me she just pushed me
[2:38:29] you don't ask those
[2:38:31] questions she
[2:38:33] entered but my husband received her as
[2:38:37] if he has ever known her
[2:38:41] before he does not
[2:38:43] say refuse people whether they are
[2:38:47] Muslims they have been coming at home
[2:38:49] home there saying what a simple
[2:38:53] man he loves us even when we are
[2:38:58] low is not our leaders there they only
[2:39:03] associate with big people but this one
[2:39:06] is a man of people even
[2:39:11] cholas he would have gathered much for
[2:39:15] himself but he was somebody who was not
[2:39:18] selfish
[2:39:20] whenever he sees somebody need he helps
[2:39:24] he gives
[2:39:26] away this was really a life
[2:39:34] too we thank God we tried our
[2:39:39] best but I thank I thank the
[2:39:43] family they also loved
[2:39:45] him I remember there's a quote the
[2:39:48] prophet said
[2:39:51] you were
[2:39:52] blessed if you help your
[2:39:55] parents because they helped you when you
[2:39:59] were you could not help
[2:40:02] yourself I thank God that my children
[2:40:06] have been
[2:40:07] there we left
[2:40:10] everything we said you want to see that
[2:40:14] okay my son left even the
[2:40:17] work he has been there for his
[2:40:21] father I thank him for that
[2:40:24] heart I only pray because he has been
[2:40:27] talking about love he wanted a United
[2:40:31] Family a lovely
[2:40:34] family may my children take that
[2:40:37] example let nobody come between
[2:40:41] you
[2:40:43] love hold yourselves
[2:40:47] together never despise the
[2:40:50] you a friend because he doesn't have
[2:40:53] much and you have
[2:40:55] more when you see you have
[2:40:58] much help the one who does not have to
[2:41:01] lift him up always stay together maybe
[2:41:06] one day I may not be there to guide you
[2:41:12] but you know I already speak
[2:41:15] love I already speak love for you and
[2:41:19] and I always long to see you peacefully
[2:41:22] and lovely never divide
[2:41:26] yourselves stay
[2:41:28] together and take keep the name of
[2:41:32] Daddy I know he's
[2:41:34] gone we have been discussing we thought
[2:41:37] he would stay and maybe we go together
[2:41:40] in the
[2:41:41] Rapture but it has not
[2:41:44] happened he has gone
[2:41:47] before I know is waiting
[2:41:50] though it was painful he always
[2:41:53] said I would have loved to go but I fear
[2:41:58] to leave my
[2:41:59] wife because he knew how close we were
[2:42:03] we really loved one another it was not a
[2:42:06] pretended love it was a begin
[2:42:10] love one thing I never even
[2:42:14] packed my bugs that I'm running home
[2:42:20] I think my people
[2:42:21] testify and I've never even start to
[2:42:25] complain about
[2:42:27] him and whatever we went through
[2:42:31] difficult the
[2:42:33] mountains the thing we were always stuck
[2:42:37] together when we were paying school fees
[2:42:39] of our
[2:42:41] children we will pay
[2:42:44] all yet we even go

[2:47:47] lies in in state
[2:47:49] [Music]

[2:48:08] [Music]
[2:48:11] orra brother
[2:48:13] [Music]
[2:48:16] Charles can only be defined
[2:48:19] Ed by
[2:48:22] love he a man who did whatever he
[2:48:27] did simply because he believed that's
[2:48:31] what represented the
[2:48:34] word I
[2:48:35] remember in
[2:48:40] 1978 I was a young Pentecostal
[2:48:47] believer and uh
[2:48:50] I was so much zealous in winning souls
[2:48:53] for the
[2:48:55] Lord we were staying in campala
[2:48:58] then but I believed that Ginger I mean
[2:49:03] [Music]
[2:49:04] tororo you know needed the light I
[2:49:07] didn't know why but I strongly
[2:49:11] believed I should go to tororo and
[2:49:13] testify of the goodness of the
[2:49:16] Lord I spent here about one week that
[2:49:20] was in
[2:49:23] 1978 and then as I had my Bible in the
[2:49:26] hand and I was moving back and forth in
[2:49:29] casoli
[2:49:32] area I met a little group of about 15
[2:49:37] people and they were having
[2:49:40] Fellowship the man who was there was
[2:49:43] Senor in
[2:49:45] age this is a man who moved all the way
[2:49:48] from Malawi
[2:49:49] to come and testify of this
[2:49:53] message they used to call him P
[2:49:56] Philly and he was raised under the
[2:50:00] ministry of mson
[2:50:01] bosy whom brother Bram speaks
[2:50:06] about the little he knew he stood for
[2:50:11] it and when I entered that
[2:50:15] house they told me you are welcome
[2:50:19] speak to
[2:50:21] us that was
[2:50:25] 1978 I opened my Bible to the book of
[2:50:30] Samuel and straight I
[2:50:33] went on the story of
[2:50:37] Eli a priest with deeming
[2:50:42] eyes I preached my heart
[2:50:45] out and after I sat down
[2:50:49] a young man in a cat
[2:50:52] Shir with Tire
[2:50:55] shoes stood to my face and
[2:50:58] said unto what were you
[2:51:02] baptized it was a very interesting
[2:51:06] question I tried the best I could to
[2:51:08] defend the
[2:51:11] Trinity but I was
[2:51:14] beaten and then I said I
[2:51:19] you people who follow weam
[2:51:22] Bram they said no we don't follow
[2:51:27] him I said didn't he say we were going
[2:51:30] in the Rapture in
[2:51:32] 1977 they told me no he didn't say
[2:51:36] that so I asked what did he say they
[2:51:40] gave me the seven Church age book
[2:51:43] brother Charles oio gave me the book and
[2:51:46] says go and read this book
[2:51:48] [Music]
[2:51:50] and when you
[2:51:52] come to finishing this book let us meet
[2:51:56] again I spent a week I read the book
[2:52:00] over I spent the day in the book The
[2:52:03] Night in the
[2:52:05] book and then when I came to the
[2:52:09] spot I didn't
[2:52:12] see that brother Branham
[2:52:16] prophesied he said I predict
[2:52:19] and he repeated it several
[2:52:23] times so I went back and I said I have
[2:52:28] seen what you people say then they said
[2:52:32] we are not going to discuss more take
[2:52:34] this book and read this one
[2:52:38] also then we can be able to kind of have
[2:52:42] a wider
[2:52:44] discussion they gave me the seven seal
[2:52:47] book h
[2:52:49] and I read it in one week when I came
[2:52:53] back I didn't have questions I said I
[2:52:57] believe where is the
[2:52:59] [Music]
[2:53:03] water the streams were
[2:53:07] dry and we followed a little stream
[2:53:11] somewhere in tororo where I don't
[2:53:13] remember until we find enough
[2:53:17] water to cover a person I was baptized
[2:53:21] by Brother Charles
[2:53:22] [Music]
[2:53:27] oo so when people talk about where the
[2:53:30] message began
[2:53:32] from we were not part of the
[2:53:36] Jerusalem which was from tesso
[2:53:40] college after some
[2:53:43] time we were introduced to the older
[2:53:45] brothers brother John oiso here Brother
[2:53:49] Martin Tom who is in Canada now and
[2:53:53] brother MTI that were in trog girls and
[2:53:56] that's how we came together in
[2:54:00] Fellowship years
[2:54:02] later brother Charles became the pastor
[2:54:06] of that
[2:54:08] fellowship and I want to say all of us
[2:54:11] who are
[2:54:12] here have been helped in one way or
[2:54:17] another
[2:54:18] by his
[2:54:20] ministry he was honest with whatever he
[2:54:25] said there was no shars when brother CH
[2:54:28] talked to
[2:54:29] you if he said no he meant it very
[2:54:34] well I want to remember one scripture in
[2:54:38] Proverbs
[2:54:40] 18:24 which says that a man that has
[2:54:44] friends must show himself friendly and
[2:54:47] there is a friend that sticketh closer
[2:54:51] than a
[2:54:52] brother brother Charles was not only a
[2:54:55] brother to
[2:54:57] me he was a
[2:55:00] friend I always tell my
[2:55:03] children when you find a
[2:55:06] friend never lose
[2:55:09] him never lose
[2:55:12] him so I thank
[2:55:16] God that he was not only a brother he
[2:55:20] was a
[2:55:22] friend he always followed me
[2:55:26] up until I was able to separate from
[2:55:33] Pentecost and then one of my first
[2:55:37] disciples was brother Ben namag goia if
[2:55:41] you can stand up
[2:55:43] [Music]
[2:55:48] we were
[2:55:49] close and we preached
[2:55:53] everywhere they called us the
[2:55:56] Trinity and we accepted
[2:56:00] it so you
[2:56:03] know I was always checking on him and
[2:56:07] many years we moved
[2:56:10] together and uh a
[2:56:14] friend will
[2:56:16] always love you
[2:56:19] despite your
[2:56:21] weaknesses that's what we call a
[2:56:25] friend that is brotherly
[2:56:28] kindness brotherly kindness is not a
[2:56:32] Doctrine but a practical life
[2:56:37] experience that every one of us is
[2:56:40] supposed to
[2:56:43] exercise brotherly kindness doesn't tell
[2:56:45] you to love me because I'm a good person
[2:56:49] brother Bram says even when a brother is
[2:56:52] All Out Of
[2:56:54] Tune Express that loved that brother his
[2:56:59] brotherly
[2:57:01] kindness you know I love David he's a
[2:57:06] man
[2:57:08] who expressed brotherly
[2:57:13] kindness you know and it's what gave him
[2:57:17] the kingdom
[2:57:21] during his training on the backside of
[2:57:24] the
[2:57:25] desert he was looking after
[2:57:28] sheep he got all kinds of several
[2:57:31] challenges there he was attacked by a
[2:57:35] bear that he tore and
[2:57:38] killed he saw a sheep I mean a lion
[2:57:42] invad his
[2:57:44] ship and I tell you he tow that lion to
[2:57:50] Pieces then one time as a shepherd of
[2:57:54] God's
[2:57:55] people God was proving that
[2:57:59] man he ends up getting out of the
[2:58:02] Battleground to take his brother's food
[2:58:06] and found a giant
[2:58:08] gorth challenging the armies of the
[2:58:10] Living
[2:58:11] God he stood and said who is this
[2:58:15] uncircumcised
[2:58:16] Philistine that's challenging the armies
[2:58:19] of
[2:58:21] God they didn't believe him but he was
[2:58:26] anointed the true
[2:58:28] anointing is not physical
[2:58:34] manipulation either it's uh real scream
[2:58:38] or is supreme
[2:58:41] power under
[2:58:43] control and it was holding David in it
[2:58:48] is something that was brewing up deep
[2:58:51] down into his seed
[2:58:53] Jin so said let's try this
[2:58:56] gift he got five
[2:58:59] stones and brought down the
[2:59:02] Giants he slw
[2:59:06] gath so but you know brother
[2:59:11] [Music]
[2:59:15] kindness brought de to the
[2:59:19] kingdom after that the church recognized
[2:59:24] his
[2:59:25] gift the anointing that he already
[2:59:28] received by
[2:59:30] Samuel the women sang the
[2:59:33] church David has killed his
[2:59:38] thousands but Saul has killed his
[2:59:42] hundreds so became so
[2:59:46] jealous still brother carness was
[2:59:51] called to be put up on this
[2:59:55] plan so tried the best he
[2:59:58] [Music]
[3:00:00] could to kill
[3:00:03] David but
[3:00:05] David had supreme power under
[3:00:09] control because of Brotherly kindness he
[3:00:13] was avoiding the wrath of Saul in the
[3:00:17] mountain
[3:00:19] down in The
[3:00:20] Valleys one day he was tempted to
[3:00:24] return some stuff and he cut the HM of
[3:00:29] Soul's garment it hurt him so
[3:00:33] much that was brother Charles
[3:00:37] O he would feel so bad if he said
[3:00:41] something nasty about a
[3:00:43] brother he would say I've lost my peace
[3:00:50] David had what we call brotherly
[3:00:54] kindness brotherly kindness has got the
[3:00:58] ability to hide your potentials to
[3:01:01] Har it takes it under
[3:01:04] control that even if you are
[3:01:08] angry
[3:01:10] sometimes we may think we can get angry
[3:01:14] on behalf of God
[3:01:18] just like
[3:01:20] Levi did and
[3:01:24] Simeon then they went and almost killed
[3:01:27] the wall of
[3:01:29] sim Jacob was not
[3:01:32] happy he said in the land separate
[3:01:37] them and when Joshua got into the
[3:01:40] land he separated them he could not put
[3:01:44] them close to one
[3:01:46] another because because if you join
[3:01:49] together to do harm the next thing when
[3:01:52] there is nobody to harm you are going to
[3:01:55] harm each
[3:01:56] other Jacob says separate
[3:02:00] them so even after David become
[3:02:05] king because that was the last thing he
[3:02:08] did brotherly kindness to bring down
[3:02:11] charity to cap down his
[3:02:15] kingdom even when he became king he was
[3:02:19] still tested on the grounds of Brotherly
[3:02:24] kindness he just felt like Saul is
[3:02:28] dead I don't want people to think that
[3:02:31] I've got some kind of anx to grind
[3:02:34] against the family of
[3:02:35] Saul then he says is there any that is
[3:02:40] left of the House of Saul that I may
[3:02:42] show him the kindness of
[3:02:45] God he says on my own
[3:02:48] I canot if there is any kindness left is
[3:02:52] the kindness of
[3:02:54] God if we can let The Virtuous Life of
[3:02:58] Christ mold us the
[3:03:01] angers the history let it
[3:03:05] [Music]
[3:03:07] die we are all a product of brother CH
[3:03:12] or the
[3:03:14] ministry that's the brotherly kindness
[3:03:18] that charity will desire to see
[3:03:21] you so brother Charles
[3:03:24] oio was not only my pastor but a
[3:03:28] friend and a friend does not allow the
[3:03:33] codes of friendship to
[3:03:35] [Music]
[3:03:37] break all of us should have been the
[3:03:40] first
[3:03:42] people to come when we
[3:03:45] hear that a j GI of Faith Among Us has
[3:03:51] rested we would put our hands
[3:03:54] together for the purpose of the
[3:03:59] cause I'll remind you one
[3:04:03] thing
[3:04:05] God told
[3:04:09] Abraham that put
[3:04:11] away the son of the born
[3:04:14] woman he cannot be here with the son of
[3:04:18] the
[3:04:20] promise but can you
[3:04:26] imagine ishma that was going and crying
[3:04:30] and you know the mother put him aside
[3:04:33] because she thought he would
[3:04:36] die when Abraham
[3:04:39] died in Genesis
[3:04:42] [Music]
[3:04:44] 25 ishma came and
[3:04:48] participated in the funeral of his
[3:04:52] father who put him
[3:04:55] away I want to speak to the churches
[3:04:59] here that we are not in competition in
[3:05:03] the
[3:05:06] ministry we are not in
[3:05:09] competition whatever the Lord allows you
[3:05:11] to do do it with a basis of love
[3:05:18] just maintain the legacy of this young
[3:05:20] man who has rested he's young because he
[3:05:25] has broken the barri of
[3:05:27] time he's 18
[3:05:29] [Music]
[3:05:34] now to celebrate his
[3:05:36] legacy that has benefited all of us let
[3:05:41] the acts
[3:05:43] for don't hold the acts no more
[3:05:48] we are a
[3:05:51] Brotherhood God bless you thank you for
[3:05:54] coming and being part of this I pray the
[3:05:58] Lord blesses
[3:05:59] [Music]
[3:06:00] you I just want to say one more
[3:06:04] time we are not in a popularity
[3:06:08] contest everybody has got a little part
[3:06:13] God has given to him let us be faithful
[3:06:16] to that and that's what God will reward
[3:06:20] God bless you God bless you so
[3:06:24] much in
[3:06:26] humility I want to invite brother James
[3:06:32] musaka who has worked also extensively
[3:06:36] with
[3:06:38] brother uh Charles oo to come and seal

[3:06:44] day with someone brother you

[3:07:12] all we can do you see Heaven is not my
[3:07:15] Doctrine it is not my Doctrine which
[3:07:18] takes me there is the personal
[3:07:21] relationship with Christ that life
[3:07:24] hitting the seed J and transforming
[3:07:28] it you see you shall never know
[3:07:31] everything we shall never see everything
[3:07:35] together you know Peter didn't know what
[3:07:37] Paul knew but both of them were Apostles
[3:07:40] and saint of God let us be a body God
[3:07:45] bless you
[3:07:50] [Music]
[3:07:54] God bless you so
[3:07:57] much um I want to thank
[3:08:02] God that I've got this
[3:08:06] opportunity to come and be together with
[3:08:10] you over the
[3:08:13] issue of the departing of our precious
[3:08:17] [Music]
[3:08:20] brother
[3:08:22] uh if it is the
[3:08:25] preaching then we have heard the
[3:08:29] sermons okay what the Brethren have
[3:08:33] [Music]
[3:08:36] testified they have revealed to us the
[3:08:38] work of Christ in a
[3:08:43] person and that's what we are looking
[3:08:45] for on this Earth
[3:08:50] I want to appreciate the
[3:08:54] family for the grace God has given you
[3:08:57] to stand all these
[3:09:04] prees
[3:09:06] that you never know the process could
[3:09:09] have
[3:09:10] been what the situation to be what it is
[3:09:19] but in life it's not good to choose
[3:09:21] another
[3:09:25] person Paul told us we must appreciate
[3:09:31] God in
[3:09:33] [Music]
[3:09:37] everything we
[3:09:40] are that's something we should not
[3:09:42] forget in
[3:09:46] life as we go this
[3:09:50] journey we need each
[3:09:53] other and one of the worst thing the
[3:09:56] devil can
[3:10:00] do he finds people walking together for
[3:10:04] a common
[3:10:08] cause and he breaks that
[3:10:10] [Music]
[3:10:14] Fellowship to me I've experienced that
[3:10:17] that is the worst thing that we can
[3:10:25] have appreciate the pastors who have
[3:10:32] come
[3:10:33] here the from
[3:10:38] Kenya we have been with brother k for
[3:10:41] quite a long
[3:10:46] time now is the way got lost from
[3:10:54] him and here besides
[3:10:57] [Music]
[3:10:59] him uh this is Pastor
[3:11:02] [Music]
[3:11:05] Sam it's the brother who led me to this
[3:11:13] message when I was a Pentecostal
[3:11:19] Pentecost uh here also I have my pastor
[3:11:28] Ben who took a very big part in my
[3:11:37] life
[3:11:38] and the other Breen who are here God
[3:11:41] bless you so
[3:11:48] it is there is a
[3:11:51] need we can't
[3:11:55] pretend there is a
[3:11:58] need and when I see of God like
[3:12:07] P stepped so much
[3:12:10] into the problems of brother Charles
[3:12:14] [Music]
[3:12:24] CH the family knows we know
[3:12:30] it we need at this crucial
[3:12:37] hour men and women of
[3:12:42] God to join hands with him
[3:12:47] there is a big gap which has been
[3:12:52] left to stand together for the
[3:12:55] [Music]
[3:12:56] family and
[3:12:59] church during during
[3:13:04] funerals we speak good and
[3:13:10] promise and when we go back homes we
[3:13:13] forget about it
[3:13:18] but at this
[3:13:20] time remember we are
[3:13:23] believers let us forget about what
[3:13:26] divided us because the
[3:13:34] devil and come back for the right
[3:13:42] cause there's a lot of love which has
[3:13:44] been spoken about a brother
[3:13:51] I'm one of them during very difficult
[3:13:54] times of
[3:14:03] the I I stayed in his
[3:14:09] house sister would cook for
[3:14:14] me he would receive me and talk with me
[3:14:18] and encourage
[3:14:23] me I thank God for
[3:14:28] him did not only have
[3:14:32] love was a man
[3:14:40] oft one time he told
[3:14:43] me he was crossing the border at
[3:14:56] thenc supect was a
[3:15:02] wrong of the Innocence he
[3:15:12] had how are
[3:15:15] you when he did it
[3:15:18] this people started
[3:15:22] qu started
[3:15:25] fear oh it's okay you can
[3:15:30] go
[3:15:32] actually is a man who put himself very
[3:15:40] low time after preaching he went
[3:15:42] baptizing
[3:15:47] went home and there was no
[3:15:52] food God touched one
[3:16:02] man he carried a big bag
[3:16:06] of when he was after
[3:16:11] preaching he had a thir somebody falling
[3:16:14] outside
[3:16:19] just to discover the man went home he
[3:16:21] said something told me to bring this to
[3:16:29] the one time he was preaching in my
[3:16:34] church there was anly brother who was
[3:16:37] not coming to church for a
[3:16:43] while when he had his sermon
[3:16:50] he received something
[3:16:54] special was so happy the whole of that
[3:17:00] week and that's the week that to
[3:17:09] with
[3:17:14] for when the Bible talks of footsteps of
[3:17:17] the rightous being ordered of the
[3:17:22] lord we have it our
[3:17:28] brother maybe without wasting
[3:17:31] time tired let's read a scripture and I
[3:17:34] say something
[3:17:39] little and then I hand over second
[3:17:43] Corinthians chapter 4
[3:17:48] the Bible says verse
[3:17:51] 16 for which cause we faint
[3:17:57] not but though our outward
[3:18:03] Manish yet the inward man is renewed day
[3:18:07] by
[3:18:11] day for our light affli
[3:18:16] wa but for a
[3:18:19] moment work for us a far more exiting
[3:18:22] and eternal weight of
[3:18:27] Glory while we
[3:18:32] look praise God verse 18 while we look
[3:18:35] not at the things which are
[3:18:39] seen the things which are not
[3:18:44] seen things which are seen
[3:18:47] are
[3:18:49] temporal the things which are not seen
[3:18:52] are
[3:18:56] Eternal let's pray precious father we
[3:18:59] thank you for the scriptures we have
[3:19:04] read Lord you know very
[3:19:07] well I am not the best among your
[3:19:14] Ministries but it has fallen my Lord
[3:19:19] are children who
[3:19:23] need you know how to do
[3:19:27] it through your own
[3:19:30] way speak through a
[3:19:33] man and encourage your
[3:19:37] children
[3:19:40] encourage when we hear moving statements
[3:19:43] from these ministers
[3:19:50] and from
[3:19:52] brother we know there's something that
[3:19:55] has
[3:19:57] happened something has touched them it
[3:20:00] is something that has moved us out of
[3:20:03] our
[3:20:07] position that our brother
[3:20:11] rest give us also the
[3:20:14] peace let's focus on that
[3:20:18] our brother is at
[3:20:21] home Inus
[3:20:24] name amen may God bless you
[3:20:29] as amen amen so this is something for
[3:20:34] us to
[3:20:36] know to
[3:20:38] think
[3:20:41] about ourselves here and there
[3:20:46] see the love of
[3:20:48] God which has done for
[3:20:51] us that according to the
[3:20:54] scriptures to Apostle PA and
[3:20:59] others we are not crying like people
[3:21:02] without
[3:21:05] hope God gave us the
[3:21:08] hope and this is the time to
[3:21:11] know that what God has put in our
[3:21:15] hearts is greater than other physical
[3:21:18] things he has to
[3:21:21] us come to stressful
[3:21:24] moments there is something that can hold
[3:21:29] us and I
[3:21:31] believe in this world there are many
[3:21:35] things that have been given to
[3:21:38] people there are many great
[3:21:41] names great works great
[3:21:44] discoveries great powers
[3:21:48] that people have
[3:21:50] achieved but I want to say
[3:21:53] this the most important thing of
[3:21:57] all that when Jesus saved
[3:22:01] us he put something in our
[3:22:05] soul don't just talk about it on our
[3:22:09] lips we experience
[3:22:13] it and actually as our brother has said
[3:22:17] love is not just as someone
[3:22:21] preached something
[3:22:24] talked something that is just
[3:22:28] read but the love of
[3:22:30] God the presence of God in our
[3:22:35] lives come and stand for
[3:22:38] us when we cannot
[3:22:41] stand the prophet
[3:22:43] says that you should have sweetness
[3:22:46] towards your
[3:22:49] enemy that's not a
[3:22:53] the those are not
[3:22:56] statements a
[3:22:57] life he spoke of what he
[3:23:01] lived and we are supposed also to speak
[3:23:04] what we
[3:23:06] live is that's why when you have not
[3:23:09] gotten that experience of God in your
[3:23:13] heart even difficult to preach it
[3:23:18] the father hard to testify what you are
[3:23:24] not we are the word of
[3:23:27] God we are supposed to speak what we
[3:23:33] are we love what we
[3:23:38] areed that's the best inheritance we can
[3:23:41] give our
[3:23:45] children I want to say this because God
[3:23:48] created us in his
[3:23:51] IM
[3:23:54] Fallen there is something in each one of
[3:23:58] us
[3:24:01] be to be a great man you're going to be
[3:24:04] a great
[3:24:06] somebody the best greatness you can
[3:24:10] have best greatness you can leave behind
[3:24:17] is the life of Jesus
[3:24:21] Christ all other
[3:24:23] things we have
[3:24:26] examples there are people who have been
[3:24:28] great
[3:24:38] scientists we read great
[3:24:41] things but let me tell you there is one
[3:24:45] person
[3:24:47] who came on this
[3:24:48] Earth we don't read of him as
[3:24:52] invading inventing an
[3:24:57] aned anything of
[3:25:01] science but he handled
[3:25:05] science his point of view of
[3:25:11] creation speak to the
[3:25:14] winds he could speak speak things and
[3:25:17] they
[3:25:19] changed the same
[3:25:22] power he gave it to
[3:25:26] Willi and could speak to
[3:25:34] [Music]
[3:25:36] a that's a situation should come
[3:25:41] in yes we have been
[3:25:44] hurt everyone who is
[3:25:47] here been hurt in one way
[3:25:50] or how can we be restored
[3:25:54] back how can it be possible that we can
[3:25:57] forget the
[3:26:00] past and start something
[3:26:02] [Music]
[3:26:04] fresh it is the presence of Jesus
[3:26:09] Christen Amen Let Us understand that the
[3:26:13] experiences we have gone through
[3:26:17] teaches us that there was something
[3:26:18] missing in
[3:26:21] us because God is
[3:26:24] love and let God back in our
[3:26:29] lives if he comes back in our
[3:26:33] lives we shall come back to each
[3:26:37] other someone are not going to bring
[3:26:41] Unity the experience of God is
[3:26:44] visitation
[3:26:48] is what is going to
[3:26:52] bring God works by
[3:26:55] pressure when pressure is
[3:26:57] [Music]
[3:26:59] coming there is a reason God wants to
[3:27:02] use
[3:27:04] that to
[3:27:06] learn God things are
[3:27:10] lessons and we should not leave them
[3:27:14] pass we should use them to
[3:27:18] learn
[3:27:20] praise the best thing God would give
[3:27:24] us is to make us own of
[3:27:30] land if he
[3:27:33] wanted would have given us to live
[3:27:35] eternally when
[3:27:40] even but the best he could
[3:27:44] do give eternal
[3:27:48] life he brought us back to
[3:27:52] himself at the time of being
[3:27:56] restored back to him who is the
[3:28:01] word if there is any testimony we can
[3:28:04] think
[3:28:05] about which has ever been
[3:28:08] special which has ever been
[3:28:11] unique which we read in the Bible
[3:28:16] or in the
[3:28:17] world it is a God made
[3:28:22] testimony there are no characters on
[3:28:25] Earth that have been
[3:28:28] compared the Bible
[3:28:31] characters and it's not mirac Miracle
[3:28:36] working it is living the life of
[3:28:40] Christ and the greatest
[3:28:43] enemy is ourselves
[3:28:48] not the person you are pointing the
[3:28:49] finger
[3:28:51] at is
[3:28:54] ourselves Jesus
[3:28:56] Christ Mighty
[3:28:59] conquer praise God brought on
[3:29:03] Earth that nobody ever lived a nature
[3:29:08] like the only nature which had
[3:29:13] power still has power
[3:29:16] to take us
[3:29:18] sinners we have seen we are defeated in
[3:29:21] many
[3:29:23] ways but God can bring us to
[3:29:28] himself like
[3:29:30] him and live like
[3:29:33] him praise
[3:29:35] God you can live for the
[3:29:39] children is a testimony they have given
[3:29:42] us
[3:29:44] amen it's no need the money
[3:29:53] what was in the
[3:29:57] family is true like theal
[3:30:01] son if you go very far
[3:30:04] away and
[3:30:07] God you will come
[3:30:10] back that's why the Bible say train your
[3:30:13] child
[3:30:16] way of God so that with time even if
[3:30:20] he's in a situation where he will come
[3:30:24] back amen so the prophet
[3:30:28] says if somebody says if a doctor says
[3:30:33] who your dad is gone there is no hope
[3:30:36] for your
[3:30:38] dad your dad
[3:30:40] is he said the best I can do for my
[3:30:43] children
[3:30:46] open my mouth and tell my
[3:30:49] children your dad is not
[3:30:52] dying your dad is
[3:30:56] resting that's the best thing you can
[3:30:58] know about
[3:31:00] it if Jesus never
[3:31:03] die if in the
[3:31:06] Bible told that he went to
[3:31:10] sleep that's why the scripture
[3:31:12] says they stoned him and then he went to
[3:31:15] sleep
[3:31:20] likewise our brother has gone to
[3:31:24] sleep going to
[3:31:26] rest in a better
[3:31:29] place we have not come here to
[3:31:32] cry we have come here to learn a
[3:31:35] lesson and God's lessons are
[3:31:39] Faith bring
[3:31:46] also do
[3:31:48] that I had an
[3:31:51] aunti she was
[3:31:53] dying I looked at her when she was
[3:31:56] dying I told
[3:32:00] myself I don't want to
[3:32:03] die then I saw my I read about
[3:32:09] bosor when
[3:32:12] dying and then he said I'm not dying
[3:32:17] this the best moment of my
[3:32:19] time best time I've ever
[3:32:22] been and then he started shaking
[3:32:25] people's
[3:32:27] hands praise God there was a
[3:32:31] sister when she was about to
[3:32:34] go she veryy
[3:32:39] very he says I've been seeing
[3:32:43] Angels here and we felling
[3:32:48] mother not
[3:32:52] them when
[3:32:55] felling I want to go like
[3:32:58] that oh I don't want to kick
[3:33:02] people I don't want to see
[3:33:05] Darkness I want to see the
[3:33:07] light and the same light we see when we
[3:33:11] are
[3:33:11] [Music]
[3:33:13] going the same light we saw
[3:33:17] when we are Jesus
[3:33:20] Christ there is no
[3:33:24] Memorial that we can ever think
[3:33:27] of than the death and resurrection of
[3:33:29] our Lord Jesus
[3:33:33] Christ he up he
[3:33:37] ConEd prise
[3:33:39] God to do
[3:33:41] that let's think on our ways
[3:33:46] amen amen think of a better
[3:33:49] thing Jesus
[3:33:51] Christ was so much in Harmon with the
[3:33:56] father until the father was in
[3:33:59] him whatever he
[3:34:03] spoke it
[3:34:05] created and Jesus Christ want such with
[3:34:11] us whatever we shall
[3:34:14] speak because it's
[3:34:16] us it will
[3:34:18] happen what is causing the
[3:34:21] problem thinking
[3:34:25] that the Bible says let's think one
[3:34:30] thing mind which was in Jesus
[3:34:35] Christ
[3:34:37] us let us understand

[3:39:03] wrong why did I get annoyed like
[3:39:08] that Jesus told the
[3:39:12] devil the Jews
[3:39:15] has no in
[3:39:18] him even
[3:39:21] us cannot separate
[3:39:24] us not part of our
[3:39:29] virt we have something
[3:39:38] bettered is a
[3:39:40] shame for a man to KNE before a
[3:39:43] woman for a man to KN before a
[3:39:48] woman but the spirit of
[3:39:50] God lifted that man
[3:40:01] beyond let us watch out those Spirits we

[3:40:29] and we go for
[3:40:32] each
[3:40:35] we
[3:40:39] why it means we are still in those Cal
[3:40:47] we are
[3:40:49] noted God should help us
[3:40:53] tot I'm
[3:40:55] finishing Jesus
[3:40:57] Christ was so much in harmony with the
[3:41:02] father he didn't need toce
[3:41:07] himself what
[3:41:09] spoke vated
[3:41:13] him let's check what
[3:41:19] speak what we are handling what we are
[3:41:23] dealing with each
[3:41:25] other how weing
[3:41:33] each I believe we talking I'm talking
[3:41:37] toen let think about what we say
[3:41:48] how he handle the grace God has
[3:41:51] given God has given
[3:41:54] us is not a stepping stone for
[3:42:08] PP preaching things that have gone
[3:42:11] through
[3:42:16] has used
[3:42:18] us there is where he has used
[3:42:20] me there is where he has used
[3:42:23] you let's wake
[3:42:26] up let us know the voice of the
[3:42:30] devil the voice of Jesus
[3:42:35] Christ
[3:42:37] amen God is
[3:42:39] SE cannot
[3:42:43] perish it cannot
[3:42:47] the prophet
[3:42:49] says other could do
[3:42:53] this
[3:42:56] no nothing in
[3:42:59] Heavens
[3:43:01] El could do
[3:43:03] that but him for he was the
[3:43:08] beginning of that
[3:43:12] character the angel wasn't born as
[3:43:18] he was created a
[3:43:20] being worship
[3:43:22] God not our savior but in God was our
[3:43:43] savior because
[3:43:48] nature but it took God
[3:43:51] himself I hope you see it look that was
[3:43:58] expression to manifest such a character
[3:44:01] as
[3:44:04] that for
[3:44:06] others it was aign
[3:44:11] character let me say this there is
[3:44:14] nobody who has ever lived for
[3:44:18] God and fail to face fail to
[3:44:27] meet
[3:44:30] somewhere brother in
[3:44:36] theob family I mean a member in the
[3:44:40] family of the church somewhere
[3:44:45] when critize
[3:44:49] you something
[3:44:52] about but who are
[3:44:59] you born with
[3:45:03] evidence that we we were born with
[3:45:08] evidence that we
[3:45:12] are and we are sinners saved by by
[3:45:18] Grace walk as a sinner saved by
[3:45:25] grace that will make us walk
[3:45:31] Care Rep the of the Lord only
[3:45:35] one only one who never was like
[3:45:39] us and that's why we have the
[3:45:42] ability to speak about the
[3:45:47] impossible because they must
[3:45:50] happen don't doubt
[3:45:54] this the faith we have in what we are
[3:45:58] speaking is going to bring
[3:46:02] result if you don't wait until
[3:46:08] Rapture like our
[3:46:11] brother that is why he he created you
[3:46:21] we know very well some of us are not
[3:46:24] going to
[3:46:26] sleep some of us are not going to
[3:46:30] sleep we are
[3:46:33] waiting for a
[3:46:35] change and before the body is
[3:46:39] changed the character must
[3:46:42] change the attitude must change
[3:46:46] I don't care how emotional we
[3:46:51] are
[3:46:53] is what item are you in
[3:46:57] the what item are you before
[3:47:02] others I think that's very
[3:47:05] important what do people say I
[3:47:08] am Jesus asked what do people say I
[3:47:13] am he said then he said what did you say
[3:47:19] there he also wanted a testimony
[3:47:24] from
[3:47:26] brother we need a
[3:47:28] testimony if you don't need it I
[3:47:35] need it is something to shake
[3:47:39] me toize
[3:47:41] me something toep set me in line
[3:47:47] as I
[3:47:48] finish don't feel
[3:47:50] bad when they tell you what you
[3:47:55] are
[3:47:58] remember you lied to
[3:48:01] me I feel not like
[3:48:06] me don't be don't be let's not be
[3:48:09] cunning we are seeing this this attitude
[3:48:11] forgive me for that bad word
[3:48:19] you have perceived
[3:48:23] me me WR I am not I am I don't
[3:48:30] you Prophet tells us a human being is
[3:48:34] very
[3:48:39] intelligent and I believe is more
[3:48:41] intelligent
[3:48:46] it's not that he will judge the
[3:48:49] world it's not that later will
[3:48:53] Jud already has a spirit of
[3:49:00] disc you like him or
[3:49:03] not be
[3:49:05] frank and say brother you are
[3:49:08] right right pray for me sometimes I
[3:49:12] don't think well about
[3:49:19] be transparent
[3:49:20] [Music]
[3:49:22] before and let me tell you don't wait
[3:49:25] until you you are put in a casket
[3:49:32] like because during that time people
[3:49:34] fear to say bad
[3:49:39] things but if they tell me bad things
[3:49:43] now I think that that is good for
[3:49:46] me I should not take reason to fight
[3:49:54] back God bless you so much we know God
[3:49:58] loves
[3:50:00] us he has allowed this
[3:50:04] situation to express his love to
[3:50:09] us we have heard good
[3:50:12] things why can't we also
[3:50:16] say let me say
[3:50:19] this the brother got
[3:50:22] problems not not so much not not not
[3:50:26] that it was from
[3:50:28] people but I know some problems we get
[3:50:32] them because of the problems not created
[3:50:37] by people but sometimes lack of this you
[3:50:40] have a desire
[3:50:42] to you have a desire to help the
[3:50:48] church and you get you don't have
[3:50:56] the that also brings
[3:51:01] stress you cannot meet the condition of
[3:51:04] the age
[3:51:14] tell a
[3:51:17] lie you cannot write a
[3:51:24] letter because you're a
[3:51:27] Christian that becomes
[3:51:30] pressure your children need need
[3:51:34] things but you can't
[3:51:37] lie even get
[3:51:40] them you can't be you can't take bribes
[3:51:45] child you cannot go you cannot say let
[3:51:48] me go and beat this
[3:51:50] maybe C5 because of your
[3:51:59] integrity BR pressure to
[3:52:02] us and I've been very close to
[3:52:06] brother such a sincere person he can't
[3:52:11] lie can't run I should deal
[3:52:17] [Music]
[3:52:20] it brings
[3:52:24] pressure so we can look at maybe this
[3:52:26] happen maybe the other
[3:52:29] happen but I also know this a
[3:52:33] brother one time I had a
[3:52:36] problem and I believe he gave me all the
[3:52:38] money he had
[3:52:41] in he solved my problem
[3:52:46] and when you solve a problem like
[3:52:49] that the devil who was bothering
[3:52:55] this comes to disturb
[3:52:58] you what are you going to do
[3:53:00] now and then you go home you find a lot
[3:53:03] of
[3:53:05] problem but thanks be to
[3:53:08] God through
[3:53:12] it and children
[3:53:15] he has handed
[3:53:19] you
[3:53:25] you also
[3:53:28] take
[3:53:32] also church
[3:53:34] members do the same to each
[3:53:38] other brother was doing to
[3:53:41] you God bless you so much
[3:53:46] let's
[3:53:48] pray dear our precious Lord and Savior
[3:53:51] Jesus
[3:53:54] Christ we love
[3:53:57] you and for for us we know you do
[3:54:02] more you love us more than
[3:54:09] think Lord this situation
[3:54:12] here we cannot pretend

[4:05:53] uh praise the name of the Lord we are
[4:05:56] beginning with um the
[4:06:00] wife and then
[4:06:02] children and then sister and
[4:06:06] brother and then
[4:06:09] pastors that's the order of laying the W
[4:06:13] praise the the name of the

[4:06:42] then the viewing of the body
[4:06:45] [Music]
[4:06:54] [Music]

[4:07:08] will give them chance they will come
[4:07:09] from that

[4:07:23] uh we are beginning with the laying of
[4:07:25] the
