appreciate God for the word and I want to say something that the devil has tried to fight here and there and just a few minutes before coming here my laptop crushed and I lost my not but I'm trusting the Lord for the grace so we pray with me maybe it's what God wanted us to have tonight amen so as I preach intered together with me that the mind of God may be spoken to you amen so let's turn to the Book of Genesis and read out verse 9 amen and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not and I am I My Brother's Keeper M and he said what hast thou done The Voice voice of thy brother's blood cth unto me from the ground and now thou cast from the earth which hasth opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand let's also turn to Hebrews 12 verse 22 but you are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an inable company of angels assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven andto God the judge of all and to the spirits of of just men made perfect unto Jesus the mediator of the new the New Covenant unto the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of [Music] Abel see that he refuse not him that speaketh for if they escap not who who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he has promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven may the Lord bless his word we may get seated amen I want to speak on the expressed thoughts of God and the blood speaks amen so we have picked it from The Book of Genesis chapter four where God spoke to Cain after K had killed AB his brother and now when God spoke to him said I've heard the voice of your brother's blood crying unto me from the ground praise the Lord so God had the blood of of of Abel crying so there was a voice that was coming from the blood of Abel praise the Lord and in Hebrews 12 the Bible has told us in verse 24 that now we have Jesus Christ the mediator Newen to the blood of sprinkling praise the Lord that speaks better things than that of Abel in the old test the blood of was speaking to God it was crying out to God after Cain had slain him praise the Lord and now here in Hebrews says we have come to Jesus Christ who is the mediator and now he also said and we are also come to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things praise the Living God so now the blood speaks and when it speaks the blood of Christ speaks better things the blood of ab the blood of Christ speaks healing our souls it speaks healing of our body it speaks strength our weak vessels it speaks power to our hearts the blood of Christ speaks and when it speaks it speaks better things that of Praise the Lord now visiting Exodus 12 where God gave Moses the blood as a token for salvation by which the households of the children of Israel would be saved praise the Lord they would be saved from the death plague hit the land that night we know that night of the praise the L we know that night when when the death angel was going to visit the C was going to visit the land of Egypt because when God sent out Moses to go and deliver the people he gave him signs praise the Lord and he told him if they refuse the first one they may not refuse the second one if they refuse the second one not refuse the sign of the token of blood and now it came to pass that Pharaoh had completely refused to let go of children of Israel and yet God was determined that he had deliver his people to go to a land that he had appointed of them for one purpose to worship Him Praise the Lord and now here in the book of Exodus 12 God gave instructions to Moses and he told him to go and take the word the children of Israel and he told Let each household that come that has the ability get praise the Lord they had to get a lamb and then they slaughter it and apply blood upon the because the death was going night and the only way they would be Sav blood upon l so now the blood praise the lord we notice that that blood was applied spoke salvation to the people that were within that house so when the death angel came around and he saw the blood praise the Lord the people in there were so it was a token for their salvation praise the Lord so he passed over that house and the people were spoke salvation it spoke victory over death to that applied the token and now God spoke to Cain after the death of his brother saying the voice of your brother voice of the blood of your brother out to me from the earth praise the Lord and you know according the Bible the Bible says that the life of any being the life of any creature that has blood the life of that creature is in the blood the Lord And now when God said to to Cain the blood of your the voice of the blood of your brother cries out to me so now the life of Abel was in that blood praise the Lord now here the Bible has told us when we are come when we have been called come unto Heavenly places and unto Jesus Christ who is the mediator of the New Covenant praise the Lord and his blood speaks better things praise the Lord and I want to say this that now we know like we' been having at this series with the last Services about the expressed thoughts of God the Bible tells us that the Lamb of God was slain before the foundation of the world praise the Lord so and I want to say this that God when he saw the perversion when he saw how Satan was to pervert he saw how Satan was going to pervert his original creation Heise Lord saw it coming and so before the world was laid he had in his mind he got himself a lamb in his thoughts and then he killed this lamb praise the Lord and he got this blood and he put it upon the Altar for atonement of our sins but that was before the foundation of the world praise the Lord now when he laid it upon there we know that the lamb that talks about is Jesus Christ because John when he was baptizing and he saw Jesus coming he says Behold the Lamb of God takes Away The Sins Of Man praise the Lord now that was the Lamb of God that was in the mind of God and God had got himself L he killed it for one purpose that the blood of that lamb shed upon every sinner cleanse every sinner and save them from their sin so now I want to say this that what God did God got his life and he got his life and put his life in islamise the Lord and so when he got this his and put in the lamb that means the life of God in the blood of this lamb when he killed it and put it upon the Altar for us that means it is not the blood of the lamb but it is the life of of God himself in the lamb is the life of God himself in the blood of the lamb praise the Lord that is here atoning for our sins that's why the Bible says that we are also come to the blood of sprinkling which speaks better things than that of Abel praise the Lord and the Bible says in Leviticus let me take you back to uh to the Book of Leviticus in the Old Testament chapter 17 we are trying to lay a foundation for the expressed thoughts of God and now we have got it that the mind of God he had the thought before the foundation of the world that he would lay a lamb and then he offered it in his before it was even made manifest in his thought he thought about he he thought about the fall he thought about his people he thought about his seed he was determined to save his seed by all means that's why in his thoughts he now laid a lamb for the sacrifice of our s now even before we sin God had thought of a plan praise the Lord to help us get reconciled back to him even before you sin God thought of a way of bringing you back to himself even before you were born God thought about his thought and he thought of how help us overcome the TRS of the world when we got when we get born into the world that's why hiss he laid the lamb and offered it for sins before he committed them praise the Lord and now the Bible says andever and whatsoever man there be the book of lus 17: 10 and whatsoever man there be of the of of the House of Israel or of the strangers that so among you that eth any manner of blood I will even set my face against that so and that eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people [Music] for the life of the flesh is in the blood and have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls is the blood that makes an Aton soul that was the old T praise the Lord thousands of years before Jesus Christ came praise the Lord and remember it started with God in his thoughts praise the Lord and now he got the atonement he got the sacrifice in his and he offered praise the Lord now when the world was created and man fell now God put Shadows he put shadows and he commanded his people if a man SS let him bring a bulock let him bring a lamb and let him offer it for his all those were Shadows of the thought that God had for atonement of our sins even before the world was created and he said it is the blood and I have given you this blood for atonement for for your soul it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul praise the Lord is the blood that that beds for the soul it is the blood that speaks on our behalf before God for our forgiveness of sins it is the blood that presents our petitions before God praise the Lord and so now it through the blood that we approach God our atonement and he says I play it upon your for your atonement because it is that blood that makes the atonement for your soul and now like I said that this blood which is a shadow now when the true sacrifice came when the Lamb of God came praise the Lord to express that which was in the throat of God before the creation of the world when he came prise the Lord it was not an animal praise the Lord but now God had gotten himself [Applause] alone which was his own son praise the Lord so he got his own son son and made him alone why because he had to be obedient he had to be lowely the Lord so he likened him nature of the Lamb PR the Lord because he had to execute the instructions of the father he had to execute the The Works of the Father the purpose that God had created so now he brings him down and he offers him upon the cross for the atonement of our sins and now we know that that Lamb of God was actually God himself who condescended praise the Lord who left his throne who left his glor who left his power praise the Lord and then he condescended and then he came down and offered himself as a lamb for our sins why because he had tried all Avenue he had sent prophets praise the Lord and he had failed he had sent so many people had failed given us the Ten Commandments by which we would live our bodies were weak that we fell short of them until he thought thought about his expression he thought about his thoughts which he had before the foundation and he said now is the time praise the Lord And now when the time was come about 4,000 years about 4,000 years after the foundation of the world was laid he now comes down as the Lamb of God that takes Away The Sins Of Man praise the Lord but does not mean that our sins were remitted our sins were forgiven at the time when Jesus upon the cross our sins were remitted our sins were forgiven even before the world was why because the B clearly states that this lamb L before the foundation of the world God thought about you God thought about you before the foundation of the world Lord so now we are here today we believe the word today because we are the manifestation of the thoughts of God we believe the word today the message today because God ordained it praise the Lord and he claimed us he got us praise the Lord himself even before we were born praise the Lord so how did you believe praise the lord it's God himself that called you praise the Lord because he called you even before you were born the Lamb of God that takes the s of praise the Living God that's what John says John vers 29 he saw him and remember John was a prophet praise the Lord so and a prophet would get into the mind of God know the thoughts of God bring the thoughts of God to the people praise the Lord so when John saw him he saw him and recognized him and say sure this is the Lamb of God has come to take away the sins of people and he said this is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is prepared before me for he was before me praise the Lord he was a prophet John was a prophet and he says Jesus was before him for sure we know that John was born before Jesus praise the Lord but because he was a proph he had gone the inspiration he got the inspiration and he had got the mind of God he went ahead of time and God took him before time and he was able to see the lamb that would be offered for our sins and when he saw him he never said behold the Holy One or behold the right but he said perfect he called him the Lamb of God because surely he was the Lamb of God praise the Lord because the life of God was in Him Praise the Lord And now when he died upon the cross blood there was blood it bled when blood was bleeding that blood which was bleeding is actually the blood of God himself and in that blood the B has told us that the life of the flesh is in the blood so in the life of Jesus Christ the life of God was in that blood that was bleeding out of Calvary and now the Bible says that God got this blood and put it upon the alt for as an atonement for our souls and then he also says it is that same blood that makes the atonement for our souls it makes atonement for our sins it is the blood of Jesus Christ the life of God himself praise the Living God and the prophet says blood speaks does the blood speak can it speak that token speaks yes sir we would look back to Genesis the voice of the blood of Abel cried out against Cain praise the Lord and he say we also find it in Hebrews that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things blood speaks but how can the chemistry speak praise the Lord how can the elements of blood speak praise the Lord it is the life that is in the blood that th the speaking praise the Lord is the life that is in the blood and now we are talking about the blood of Jesus Christ so it is the life in the blood of Jesus Christ that speaks praise the Lord what does it speak we shall see that the soul that was in Cain oh in Abel it was the life that was in Christ that cries out better things it speaks loud and what is that life we know that all that God was he Ed it into Jesus Christ the lord so if it's the blood of Jesus Christ that was laid upon the altar our atonement it means it's the life of God this is the life of God is the holy spirit praise the Lord it is the holy spirit that Aton for your sins because that is the life that is in the blood praise the Lord that atones for our that atones for our weakness that beli before God for forgiveness and the reason the blood was put there was to prepare us remember even before Jesus was crucified God had had that plan before so now this blood that is laid here is is is L to prepare us to prepare the bright every day to cleanse the bright every day to sanctify the bride every day why because the purpose of God is to have a bright that has no spot that has no ring so now he gets himself his blood his blood and he lays it here and he says blood is now here it has the power to forgive it has the power to cleanse it has the power to wash so each time you get that you remember that the blood was given upon the altar then you run the blood I said father I am here I am that cleans me because that is the purpose the blood was laid upon you praise the Lord the blood was given to prepare the bride for the Rapture the blood was given to cleanse our garments our garments must be white our robes must be white we must portray righteousness praise the Lord so the blood is still there praise the Lord and as long as we are here blood shall be there praise the Lord the blood of Jesus Christ speak better things speaks righteous of to the Brokenhearted it speaks praise the Lord to the weak it speaks strength to the Fallen it speaks strength the blood of J Christ speak praise the Lord and he says believe for yourself and apply the token also for the family like they did in Egypt like they did in Egypt and like they did at Jero find out Paul told the Romans to be baptized that's 16 calling upon the name of the Lord him and his house could be saved by doing the same thing move out some people want to apply the blood and stay in you apply the blood and kick all the trash out of the house and have a house Cleansing Time look then when you realize and present the token of the blood the life it took for the token the blood speaks for us remember the Covenant blood was recognized with a token and the word assures us of the promise the token is the sign that the purchase is made for us praise the Lord that's what the prophet says he says apply the token apply the blood because the blood is here you apply it was quoting praise the Lord the Roman he says when when when Paul was speaking to him he asked him to apply the token to take Jesus Christ to accept the sacrifice accept the blood and then he said when you accept it apply it also to your household apply to your children apply to all your people in other words take the token to your children present it to them show them the truth show them the words praise the Lord present them to the Token present them before the blood praise the Lord and he says they shall all be saved praise the Living God that's it praise the Lord he said it out in Genesis the blood of Abel spoke praise the Lord and says the Abel the blood of your brother speaking it is crying the life of your brother is crying out what has happened to him and the blood of Jesus is speaking the blood of Christ is crying out praise the Lord he's crying out to every sinner he's crying out to every one of us the blood of Christ is speaking to us every day he speaks to us through the word he speaks to us through the message he speaks us through the preachers he speaks to us through the teaching of the word BL is crying out come out of her praise the Lord he's crying out every day is preparing the bride for the Rapture the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things praise the Living God yes sir that's what he says in the message the infalible proof of the Resurrection he says we are taught in the Bible that Jesus was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world we understand that he wasn't slain he wasn't slain really until 4,000 years later but when God spoke the word it was a finished work God spoke it praise the Lord and he says he was slain back here at the foundation of the world when God for saw and knew what he would do he spoke the words and it was finished right there it was a spoken word and it was finished right there praise the Lord and we know that we are also a product of the spoken word praise the Lord God spoke the word and he spoke the lamb and he spoke it to be slain for which purpose for the purpose of you and me praise the Lord and when he spoke it it had come to pass and 4,000 years later the blood of Christ had to bleed praise the Lord that sacrifice had to be offered why because God had spoken it and it had to come to pass praise the Lord and the Bible says that lamb was offered as a sacrifice for us praise the Lord so in his thoughts that lamb was offered as a sacrifice for us so now there is no reason there is no excuse praise the Lord because God had spoken and then God fulfilled it he expressed it and he has given us the blood as an atonement for our praise the Lord that's what the prophet says apply the token and kick all the drush out praise the Lord accept the sacrifice accept the voice there is a voice that is coming out of the blood every day there is a voice that is coming out of the blood which is speaking which is crying praise the Lord listen The Voice listen what the voice says to your heart apply the token by accepting the message of The Voice praise the Lord and acknowledging that it is the Life of Christ himself speaking to your heart the blood of Jesus speaks better things praise the Living God that's what he says and in Hebrews chapter 7 the first part it says listen listen here the Bible said in Revelation I'm going to take you from first to the last one the Bible said in Revelation that when the Beast came he deceived all upon the Earth the Beast did he deceived all upon the Earth those whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life since the Revival began the Revival began does that sound right well since the preacher preached that Madeon since that man was healed no sir since the foundation of the world there was Jesus laying at Calvary no sir Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world Behold the Lamb of God that was SL before the foundation of the world God in the beginning when he saw the sin he saw what would happen he spoke the word praise the Lord and Jesus was laain before the foundation of the world and every person was saved according to the Bible when the lamb was slain in the mind of God praise the Lord each one of us we are saved praise the Lord not when Christ was slain here when he was slain in the mind of God praise the Lord so now when when you accept the sacrifice when we accept the token praise the Lord that's now when we come to the Fulfillment that's now when we come the expression that's now we come the manifestation of the thoughts of God about our Salvation praise the Lord not when we believed no we were saved in the mind of God before Christ was praise the Lord and then he says before the foundation of the world you were included salvation then so what are to do about it believe the sacrifice believe Jesus Christ believe the word of God accept the voice praise the Lord that is coming out praise the Lord accept the voice that is crying out come up here come out praise the Lord and now the Bible says in the Book of Revelation chapter 4 so now God gave us this Blood to prepare us throughout the seven Church ages God gave us the sacrifice he gave us the lamb Jesus Christ who stood in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he was the root praise the Lord he was the like he was the cstone he was he was the fountain out of which each of these Messengers Sal of God to the people of the age praise the Lord so God placed him in the midst of EG and now he's been ministering through the seven Church ages praise the Lord presenting the blood presenting the voice in the blood the blood speaking to each of praise the Lord to the age of Ephesus spoke all through toia praise the Lord And now when he has prepared the bride and the bride is fully whole and she's fully clean and her robes are white then he takes the bride away praise the Lord why because the blood accepted the blood he accepted to do the bathing to do the cleansing he accepted the words and he lived by the words he walked by the words he spoke by the words he fed by the word and so he became a part of the word and he became the word praise the Lord and then we came we come to that fullness when we come to that St man he takes us away because there is no more work to be done the work is finished and in Revelation 4 verse one The Voice speaks to John and says come up here after this I looked remember from chapter two all to three he had been working through the seven churches he been dealing with the bride preparing her through the blood to be like him and when when the the work was done the Bible says and after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the voice the first voice which I had was as of a trumpet talking with me which said come up here I will show the things which must be Hereafter praise the Lord remember when God was going to destroy Sodom and gomorra God first visited Abraham praise the Lord and when God was done with Abraham when he was done walk upon Abraham and giv him the promise when he was about to leave inside him God was convicted not to hide the secrets from Abraham praise the Lord was now going to be headed to destroy Sodom but now he was convicted not to hide away the secret so now he came and he revealed the secret abrah and the Bible says here after this I looked and behold the door was open heav and the first voice which I heard was thep talking with me and says come up here I will show you things which must be Hereafter come up here the has been taken up Heaven been carried up to glory and now God is saying come up here and show you the things that are going to happen after I'm done dealing with you praise the Lord and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a stone was set in heaven sat on the throne praise the Lord and now he was carryed in the spirit and when he was carryed in the spirit a throne was setting heaven and now there was one that was seated upon that Throne remember he is here with us he left his throne to come and deal with us praise the Lord he is in us to help us praise the Lord to nurture us to mold us to be like him and now at this point he was done dealing with us he was up there praise the Lord and so he called John to show him the things that must come shortly after praise the Lord and I want to say this that God has deal with the church ages he has de with the church ages through this age of La praise the Lord and now the voice that we have is asking us to come out praise the Lord to come a little higher to take us a little higher in reation to reveal unto us things that must come shortly God is very faithful to his bright he can't hide anything from his that's why he could not hide anything from Abra he showed him what was going to happen praise the Lord that's why Abraham to plead with God say there some some hundreds that you can save psmm Psalm or even one because God showed him the things that we are going to come there after Mal praise the Lord he gives us and says behold the day cometh praise the Lord and the that is coming shall burn as an oven that the Earth shall burn as an oven it is the word that he gave and that word must come to pass because he spoke it it must come to pass but then he calls the bride says come up here I want to show you the things that must come after here praise the Lord and now I want to quote what the prophet says here praise the Living God Amen do you love him amen you listen the voice do you hear the voice speaking out your name today you hear the voice in the blood speaking about your name you hear the blood the voice in the blood calling out your name we thank God every day we hear the voice speaking to us every day when the preachers begin to preach we hear the voice calling us out every day when the pastor is preaching we hear the voice of the blood speaking to us every day when we turn on the message we hear the voice speaking to our hearts preparing us to meet the bridegroom preparing us cleansing us daily and now it says in the message Revelation 4 now after the church Ages was over and everything was come ready made ready the setting of the fourth chapter here the church Ages was done he had done left the Earth you see remember the voice that spoke to him behind him that is John in the seven golden candlesticks the work was finished and now the same voice was speaking up in heaven what was it he had done redeemed his people his work was finished and now he was in glory calling to John come up here that makes me feel like shouting amen come up here this is the setting of The Great Battle the people that rejected God's message rejected the Holy Spirit the messenger of the seven churches the one that had rejected his message the message of his grace the message of his grace had nothing left it was time no longer judgment was ready he's making ready to pour out the plagues upon the earth now come up here and I will show you what is fixing to take place Christ rejecting Sinners I'm going to pour out my rough upon them God was done working with the bright and he's done making them ready and she's him up she's pass the Wales the Wales and travs she's overcome and she set on high she's washed herself she's washed in the blood of the lamb and now she's clean come and see what I'm going to do see as it was the days of Sodom as it was the days of Noah God first Reveals His secrets to his bride he revealed to Noah what was going to happen he says it is going to rain and the people had never seen rain had never seen rain say no it is going to rain and the which is coming he's going to destroy the people but now get this message and stand in the door praise the Lord and preach to the people and so Shall Believe shall come to go through the same door was standing there was only one door the ship only one door and Noah stood in that door prach the message to the people there is only one door praise the Lord when John saw when he looked up says the door was open and what is that door Christ is that door praise the Lord And now when he speaks when John was speaking he was speaking what he saw from the door and now what God has done what God has done he has sent us his message so now he picked the messengers he stood in the door the door to heaven
