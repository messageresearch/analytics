[Music] I'm a child of the king I'm a child of a king [Music] with Jesus [Music] what's up another king a child of a king with Jesus [Music] amen Amina are you a child of the king then give the Lord the hand of praise [Applause] that Christianity goes a lot farther than what we know because it's an expression of life is Christ controlling from the throne on the inside so it goes further than just a belief system it's allowing oneself to become a reflector and the Christian Life is living out the nature and character of Christ holding the right doctrine of the message without the spirit that brought that message it doesn't make you a Believer Amen to be a believer the ability to release life from the inside amen you're drinking the word [Music] we just have to step into his spirit amen because remember John was not talking about being in his own spirit because that wouldn't have brought those Visions it had to be the spirit of God and as we are here this morning it has to be the spirit of God With Us walking to church or driving to church we mean nothing because if there's anything good that will come to me is summed up as a Divine manifestation so when Divine faith and the Holy Ghost mixes with what we believe we become kindness foreign feet and go to Philippians chapter 2. so that the spirit may speak to us this morning amen Amina Philippians and before we read that character let's just buy heads in order prayer because you allow us special moments like this when we come together rejoicing and praising your name and you pour in your blessings in the teaching of the world so in moments like this father we always just desire to surrender to pour out ourselves heavenly father but we may have a supernatural fellowship with you today we could have questions [Music] we could have desires in our lives know how to take care of them so I pray for your children that you may give them the spiritual peace that Lord I may still be able to communicate to your children bless brother James in Jesus name amen amen sorry we have not read the scripture you get down here you get lost sometimes so Philippians chapter 2 verse 5. he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Christ let that one become a permanent statement in your life when you think when you plan let this mind be new like who being in the form of God thought it not Rubble to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of the servant and was made in the likeness of men he was not a man he was more than that he was made in the likeliness of men too he was not a man Thierry Montu he was in the image there was something more than what we are yeah and being found in fashion as a man is himself and became obedient after death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also has highly exalted him which is above every name and I think we understand that very well he gave him a quality of character which was higher than all creation that by the authority of that character every name amen Amina the Western here that at the name of Jesus everyness of the bow of things in heaven and things in us and things under the Earth yes [Music] and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the father Yes Crystal yeah may the Lord that blessing the reading of his wife amen Amina so verse 7 says he made himself of no reputation and I want to take our title from that very Versace making ourselves made himself of no reputation yes and from there we want to make ourselves of no reputation amen so reputation speaks of the status which is rightly accorded and you know that status is real it is therefore making oneself of no reputation you know it speaks of taking a lower status then what is rightly accorded to you you know all best but then you take some form of humility I wait towards her you know to make yourself like the rest of the people it's making yourself of no repeaters it is making oneself void of special statuses so for example if president comes here he carries the form of Honor around him and everybody we honestly look at it and understanding that was the same where the Lord was when he came down in the body of Flesh yes but the Bible says he made himself of no reputation listen now but what did he say he did not make the set of films visible that we're always surrounding him the cherubims were not visible but as they were there amen but they were not visible are you together with me so even moments when he was challenged in not pull that authority of the Angels amen I mean one time when he was challenged at the end of his Athletics he said he could have even summoned a legend of angels foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] You Know Who You Are the form of Anthony accolades but for the cause of redemption you take a lower estate to allow the holy ghosts the work of redemption to perform a Redemption he made himself of no reputation he became a Kinsman yeah because the law required in order to redeem are you together with me so he had to become like one of us [Music] he had to come with [Music] [Music] and verse 9. foreign he says but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death amen amen for the suffering of death amen he became lower than the angels and the purpose was to die amen amen then he was crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should test death for everyone so we see the scripture says 2K16 organic element body yet [Music] for the suffering of death that he may test death for every man I went to Africa it doesn't matter what condition you were in was 10 45 you qualify that Jesus died for you yes he tested that for you yes that by the grace of God to reached he should test this to his body and then release his life amen for men foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh um he becomes the festival Africa so we all become one penetrate and therefore according to that we are all Brethren is by the same spirit that came down to him or in the Jordan River and then came to the church on the day of um he's the first born amen Amina among the brothers he became an evil Redeemer yeah the Bible calls them the grow well Amen brother Branham and this go away here and the will yeah Korea [Music] [Music] himself into a micro organ yet to bring Redemption amen Amina do you understand what I'm saying when you look up here brother tells us to come from one star to another stand it's millions of light years and yet the light is so fast but then you multiply that is 24. to get uh uh know I learned to get a mask and then together [Music] are you together with me created a very vast space you go past the and released himself in the blood cells and then created a little egg yeah are you together with me to the womb of the Virgin and then he was born amen but when he comes down nobody knew he was the creator of the heavens when he went to the house of Simon they disregarded his presence foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] able to praise that before you this morning there was no reputation when you land obedience by the things which he suffered already in order to build the characters [Music] but the moment you know we get into this body of Flesh there is always the pool of sin upon the world are you together with me even Jesus Christ we suffered exactly the same and the only way character can be built and there is when we are in this particular body like original is God allowing us to go through chastisements amen Amina through the things we suffer already there was no reputation why was that when he pitched his tents next to John Peter and James is [Music] some famous form of mine foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and the man said every verse than that one is reputation if we continue declaring it again he would have not been cleansed because the Divine destruction was to go into Jordan and then he wins the first time yeah it became like that you take your reputation you have no Pact [Music] in order to take it [Music] you could have spent many years of education that's not your process or your path of redemption the path of redemption is we have to completely uh disregard to Renewables that's not what you use in Redemption amen now questions and answers of 54. he says I believe that the image that foreign and [Music] no one after Daniel had been thrown in the Lion's Den in hours no one should deserve any other God is God I cartooned about Daniel it was probably the image of a holy man and everybody was to bow down to this but the church Hallelujah somebody say Amen but the church Daniel being the leader as Christ being the leader of the church and they was to Bow before this image foreign [Music] foreign are together with it and so now the king says bow before this image the pastor was quiet just see what decision they are going to make are you together I'm trying to bring a point here he was just quiet watching Daniel yeah what are they going to do you see when you hear the word here go out there the challenge Comes Your Way alone what are you going to do was silent in this circumstance young people sometimes your dad will be quiet or is to see how you know you make mature decisions foreign [Music] [Music] bow before this image are you together with me please try to understand this is at the end is a similar thing will come back trying to force the children of God but one thing about Daniel Daniel did not bow before his Daniel he had made himself of no repeaters he was not part of the image that they were making financially amen amen and brother Branham an organ in the Bruce disciples fought that Spirit of taking him out of his position I'm trying to make him higher because they had seen the Miracles [Music] the people had walked out of wheelchairs Crystal [Music] he said the same thing but actually challenge Daniel is going to come back in the entertainment are you together with me but brother brother miss our brother we don't give him a position higher than that amen I mean he says here in the Bruce Sabbath message and the thing I always wanted to be you know is and desires of my heart today it was the true servant of Jesus Christ [Music] I want my testimony to be cleaning that in all my mistakes I yet love them with all my heart and I do this morning with all my heart and because of that it forces me to say I am leaving the ministry is because that there is something arose among the people that's caused me to do it but I have been taken from my bracket as a Ministry and being called Jesus Christ foreign [Music] amen you see the prophet says the same thing will come back the challenge of Daniel they build an image Finance Daniel to Bow before that would not bow before his own name is they said Daniel is our brothers Daniel is not our God Daniel Tiger is [Music] so God is that this belongs to God [Music] the more you go get closer to God as a Believer is the more you are going to become humble making ourselves but today men are making their own images I am the standard in Chinese you've seen many kids shoes you know themselves images [Music] [Music] they are the ones doing back to the furnaces of fire because we are not going to allow those people to Fellowship you see what I mean people are making different images but he made himself of no reputation in order to get gave us the Redemption and we also should make ourselves of no reputation I mean of that Redemption because it must be the same nature of the dove away [Music] Christ is the nature of the dark Christian and a True Believers [Music] that you can even give his life as a sacrifice that's why when Jesus came he was referred to as the Lamb of God [Music] [Music] [Music] let's go to Isaiah chapter 14 here foreign Isaiah chapter 14 here the verses we are going to read and he related to your summer they speak about Lucifer together crucifer Lucifer had been honored Lucifer yelling away and he was the head of the worship team in heaven our sins so he would play wonderful music amen I mean and the wall of Heaven hallelujah hallelujah now that brought a lot of Glory but Lucifer Lucifer wanted to share of the glory yeah so he wanted to assume a reputation which reputation was for God so in Isaiah chapter 14. he says praise the Lord spoken is that yeah it was not exhibited we come back that was something in his eyes it was the condition of his heart and in that heart there is a lot of eyes [Music] he lost his Redemption because he was not satisfied with where God blessed his fall originated from the condition of the house because the desires a man of God who is powerful that was the problem of listening Lucifer what God desire of us is to count ourselves of no reputation amen amen when the Lord took the human abroad of Jesus Christ of redemption he stayed in his commission yesterday as he was going to bring the redempts because he could not abide in his position the Lord said unto my Lord sit down at my right hand until I make my thy enemies he never crossed the borders he took the position sit down at myself he was God as Paul says but he did not take the position of God foreign amen I mean he said I do nothing amen of myself but as my father has told me he could not bring things out of their season movies what God has called us and stay in a state of humility and then he says and he that sent me is with me the father has not let me alone for I always do those things that please foreign amen Amina so now listen Jesus told the Beatitudes yes he was teaching the Beatitudes actually the Christ that way was commanding those that have done away with their self-assumed reputation so that the glory of God blessed are the hungry blessed are the peacemakers are you together with me this is a man the Christians they are not looking for preeminists and once you get into that kind of form and condition of life this year you know we are in the lordician church the last Church which puts Christ out of the church yes amen Amina and we know that the glory of God has been put out for drama Tomatoes amen Amina man do all kinds of uh uh Hollywood and people go to church because that's what they want to see it happens but their pasta can be funny and when it begins to be funny that's what they would go to church the age foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and then foreign [Music] are you together with me yeah Moses had took them to give put them away the darkness of their hearts Moses but he says but now I see if you put away it will go back a wife for every cause why does Jesus say so right she is he was greater than Moses Musa where the Bible says Bible recover I've refused the woman to teach but then those people come I have on trouble by them let them teaching do you know what that means they are greater than Christ single Christian they assume the glory they assume the honor but of judgment are you together with me yes so they put our Christ with Christopher now they own the church the angel of the Church of the Lord this is so by looking at this location they trusted in themselves like the Rich Young rulers he couldn't count himself of narrative are you together all your ideas he says this church of Lord this year and you can say they needed something to hold on they thought the grace of God was not enough and because they could not make themselves of no repeaters they counted themselves Unworthy of eternal life they walked away but from eternal life they walked away from the fullness of redemption when Christ stepped out saying yes [Music] the beginning of the creation of God they walked away from that okay and yet Jesus said come I think and he was presenting himself as the amen of God the soul let it be the cultivation the faithful and true witness um foreign [Music] he says me all these standards that don't know who are you diwani I am the amen the true and faithful um they'll have something that they were holding up they had some form of a reputation but they couldn't let go he had stepped out at the manifestation of the entire work of redemption the summation of it all the alpha and Amiga they didn't know they were rejecting the talking life himself are you together amen that's the Church of Lord this is because they do not want to count themselves he did not want to lose reputation God tells them going to a plane this way he says but there is that City yeah how many times do we reason with God and he's so vividual God Has Come Away sometimes but we keep listening with him not to want to be counted of no reputation foreign are you together with it same man under here yes sir I mean now listen to the audition uh from the lordistian church this thing says the faithful and true witness now I want to show you what I find in the thought of faithfulness you know we often talk about a great and changing God together whose word does not change and when we speak of him after the manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impossible it is as though God made the world universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then straight back it is as though God made the way of salvation for lost mankind that way being at the cross and then when the death of Christ has attuned our sins and this Resurrection gave us an open door to him then God forwarded his arms it's as if we imagine believing in a great Creator who have been created lost personal interest in his grace now I said that is how too many people are up to think but that's the wrong of thinking for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now he is are you together with me chaos you're fine you know when you go home he cares a fire when you close your doors we got our original he cares a fire when you go to work he cares when you get sick he cares when you have questions when you are in a condition of stress thinking that maybe God doesn't care and then you want to have your own way listen what did he say the prophet coaches say this chapter 1 verse 16. for by him when all things created in heaven this is the one invisible everybody whether they be thrown or dominions all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things [Music] by his own castle he purposed the plan for salvation foreign [Music] is on right now as the great Shepherd of the ship he is very existence is for his own he loves them I mean they know and he cares for them is never upon them when the word says your lives are hidden Christ in God it means exactly what it says oh I am so glad that my God abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he is true to the world [Music] he will lose but raise us up in the last day I am I am glad that I'm resting in his faithfulness amen are you together with me you see he came out yeah and knocked at the door yeah Lord this year the Lord is here open the door and then the priests in the Lord this year they say who are you Babu Jesus what is it trying to do he's trying to tell them that I am the one Denise completing my psycho of redemption I am the true and faithful meaning that I'm no longer origin foreign they began to say I think God doesn't care about us like the people are saying now I think God has forgotten us look at what this Sodom condition is yeah because they want to retain their reputation Philippians 1 6. being confident of this very thing that he which began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Christ amen just stay Amina and told them I'm the true witness the prophet says he is the true witness now this was true is the same word we saw back in Revelation 3 7. you recall that it does not mean teach together [Music] together as a contrast with forms it has a richer deeper meaning it expresses perfect realization amen Amina in contrast to partial realization now back in the Philadelphia News Philadelphia the coming of the Lord was growing in eye what great love that age manifested for him coming was drawing but now when the age of Lord this is he now comes and says I am the truth is [Music] for you to understand the word don't you think it is fighting a fourth thing is like we have a lamp here is but when Jesus comes and John is calling him the Lamb of God you can't wait he is [Music] telling the Lord this is the time of the fulfillments all things he was standing in face to the wealth of all what the Bible held inside and that's what what God wants to show us all the shadows of time we're washing away come on now amen Amina that's the age of lotus we are now not going to have him by friends but he was going to come as a manifestation but they walked away from the coming manifestation of the foreign [Music] getting away from the Shadows to stand in the presence we were being introduced to the person of the Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of the Lord that was going to manifest the second company amen Amina but when Jesus came I yesterday what was the pop challenge again the Bible calls him the beginning of the creation of God that's what they rejected they rejected to the manifestation of the first born which means that we are not part of your family are you together because they were literally saying oh we are not part of that Christians over foreign [Music] listen now 2017. the beginning of the creation of God tonight you see he's defining his new creation and the scoring Lord this year why didn't fry herself with this new creation but she had a personal reputation I know this year in htibachi which they were not willing to lose without losing you cannot be a Christian Christian when you are losing nothing you don't lose the night club you don't lose the love for money you can as well go and trade in words are you together they can go and trade anywhere else you will not have salvation you retain your Fashions you'll not have salvation we must lose one do you know for Jesus to bring it yesterday he lost reputation amen Amina so but now he's standing in the midst of the church as he stands in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of Christ he is the creator of the church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own brand as the spirit of God you came down and created in the Virgin Mary the sales form is body was born I want to repeat that he created the various cells in the womb of Mary for that body yet amen it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human of you supplied by Mary teacher that would have been sinful mankind producing your body that would not have produced the last Adam of whom it was law save law a body has thou prepared for me I think not Mary timmariam provided that body yeah Mary was that humanity and she carried that holy Child yeah yes and brought him to Bath it was a good man he was the son of God he was the New Creation [Music] he was the first of this race the head of the new race listen here amen I mean the new creation is not all creation made over will not be called a nucleation this is exactly what it is no longer is he dealing by ways of Flesh that was how he dealt with Israeli he chose Abraham and Abraham's line through The Godly Isaac but now I am out of another Kindred tribal Nation he has purpose the new creation of that creation he was God creating in form of a man now by his spirit is creating many sons to himself creating himself a part of his Creations amen I mean this is the truth revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took through elections that's why he could look right down so the last age and the same suffering in the midst of a church [Music] he procrastinated them to adoption of children according to the good place of his way foreign [Music] [Music] are you together with it he is at the end of the journey praise the Lord he was standing in the New Jerusalem yeah [Music] amen Amina praise the Lord so he was coming to them and they didn't like it they didn't want to lose they are reputation amen Amina Revelation chapter three we couldn't say upset verse 17th this is their reputation because you say welcome I am rich you remember the Rich his wealth locked the door to eternal life that is are you together and easy making ourselves that your wealth does not stand in your dog are you together [Music] sell out everything amen Amina but Lord this year since I am rich and increased with Goods but the Bible says [Music] and no it's not that thou art righteous and miserable they are credentials reputations they have their own repetition and the jealous [Music] they do not let his Beatitudes [Music] and neither where they in need of the doctrine of life we cannot go to God and remain self-sufficient blessed is it seems like that when man gets to a place [Music] sin begins to take a hold of the church echanism the nation number one guy the individual no motivation that feels that it doesn't need any help from outside that is true and we would not still that when people begin to feel that Superior feelings [Music] [Music] that you can repair yourself and the moment we get into that condition the prophet says then sin begins today that was the condition of Lord this is and what they needed was to empty themselves [Music] amen Amina we may ask who are we anyway but we may feel like we don't need support that we don't need help from the fight foreign [Music] notice he also puts away Lord this year this is you come into further part without them amen with what God was doing in the day because it was the time she said of the revealing of the Lord Jesus Christ who was going to come yeah amen I mean such a good stuck at a point she refused brother Branham tells us that the Lutheran Church refused for Christ to have any more Desire with her Christopher and so is it today with every one of them failed to take the word of God confuse Christ to make themselves of no reputation [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] that information then you know the need of the hour away [Music] what constitutes us foreign if God is going to work with us we need to put aside what constitutes us if it is education if it is riches over special status of any kind or remember that's what we should put aside guava I canceled by of me God tries what does that mean that's the condition which you have um it requires you to go through a state of Justice [Music] foreign amen Amina learn that and turn the page count yourself in order to receive the Redemption that Christ says amen Amina brother he says years ago he's talking about by of me I saw if you are blessed you cannot know your way and you should not reject the hand of help you don't know where to go you are blind and you are trying to to think you are going to support yourself this year was in a condition that they did not even know they were blind foreign if you give me God I would be a happy man because the whole world is going back on a good standing amen I mean the economies are falling so if you give me a good piece like this then I know I'm a wealth man that's what the problem is because the Lord this year this year is closing at a gold standard age together everything is about money when they preach it's about money sent praise the Lord so you know it is a total uh analysis of what Leo this is Miracles valued in money if the Lord performs the one million dollars is money to the gospel Lord this year closes but now he's telling them no the god so he's telling them about another God and that God is your character he's got the ability of making yourself of your reputation that's the God and that's the god you take with you in the world to come down [Music] and they would and would know how it was right or wrong by management foreign when God does his church he gives you try you have to try again until the Life of Christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful um [Music] I'm looking straight at Calvary to the one who is doing the beating amen I mean many things many times you think it's strange because fire trials foreign [Music] Hebrews 12 available the scripture says no justice made for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous I attay nevertheless afterwards it used the Peaceable fruit of righteousness have you ever go through the form of Justice it causes a cry but last week we saw a weekend pray you cry to the bitter himself are you together with me so that everything is foreign in protecting our standards we failed to buy of him the gold that's tried in fire [Music] but God's trying in fire Divine reputation Your Divine reputation amen the character that comes by fairy trial in there is [Music] the wealth that we take with us is how we are going today we are just going to build a tower to Jersey [Music] our wealth is correct the character of Christ at the word on the inside manifesting his life amen Amina oh that's the arrangements for a second of the assembling of yourselves [Music] everyone is [Music] let me talk about currency must be able to exercise their children in this character a molding process because you need the quality the fastest way you are training a child to believe in himself that's what I like a child who knows what I have is the best so that he can become an influence not one that can be fluency that one has got characters children of God what do we have is the best foreign even your eyes they need I saw guitar you get this uh kind of swollen past I don't know what they call it myself in the medical field you would tell me you cannot see you are trying to open while you are okay but there is a plaster here and they always have attendance to swelling the condition of Lord this is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is blind to God and His truth you can see nothing [Music] because they lacked foreign [Music] Surya sort of this is the one who has an attic in his house and he says my brother and I slept in the Articles yeah the Crux in the house would let the drafts blow through you know uh when it's winter because the snow comes it's like a soft quarter almost it comes like that amen I mean he says that code could come through yeah sometimes in the winter it would get so cold we wake up in the morning we search cold in our eyes but our eyes would be shut myself we would cry out to mother and up she would come with some hot country amen I mean and rub our eyes [Music] foreign [Music] which is blowing on the church in this generation eyes have sort of Frozen shirt and she is built blind it until we know she needs some Hotel of the spirit of God yes unless she resists the spirit of God she will go on substituting program for power [Music] for success to look for fruits the doctors of Theology of shared the door faith and for better come on and I'll show you things that are going to be here afterwards aren't you happy friends you've got our eyes open please what God amen I mean he says I need the attention it's a prophetic Dimension ISO they do not know that God's winding up dividend cartoon he doesn't know that they don't know that God requires them to develop themselves into the stretch of the perfect man identity the prophetic is calling us to the revelation of what God is doing in the spiritual City amen I mean because when it says he begins and he says come and see yeah the Plan of Redemption join the revelations he wants to break the seals foreign [Music] when the Bible says I will let it should be Bible app it Remains the Dead one if there is no sister or sister Anna to step into that world and show how it works are you together when the Bible says drinking is evil Bible it Remains the dead word unless there's a brother who was a drunkard are you together with me we become the revelation of the World by the life which we live you become everything amen when I age Amina I've given you quite a number of quotes because I felt they were necessary making ourselves brother James has tried a lot to interpret thank you we thank God what brother Branham says for Jesus himself is the interpretation of the Bible when is Mad manifesting the age that's the part of the Bride is being made manifest if it's a voices Liberty and I'll show you things that will be here just if we can realize oh amen Amina let's just look here Jesus time he says for that High and loved one that inhabited eternity whose name is listen what he says [Music]
