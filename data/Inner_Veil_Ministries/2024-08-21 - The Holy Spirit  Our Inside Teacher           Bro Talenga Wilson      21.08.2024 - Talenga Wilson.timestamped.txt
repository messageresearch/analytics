[7:25] holy we were not pure father father Lord
[7:28] Jesus but father father before the fall
[7:30] we were in your mind we were perfect as
[7:33] the father is but father when the fall
[7:36] came Lord Jesus Christ sin father Lord
[7:40] Jesus brought us into father bondage of
[7:43] sin it brought us father it made us
[7:46] father to come short of the glory of God
[7:49] father Lord Jesus but you didn't
[7:52] father father sat down on your throne
[7:55] and folded your hands but father you had
[7:58] a plan I Redemption plan father Lord
[8:01] Jesus you wanted us to know that you are
[8:04] you are the Redeemer you wanted us to
[8:06] know father by your powers father you
[8:09] can break the every chains of Darkness
[8:12] you can father Lord Jesus take away
[8:15] father the bondage of sin father and you
[8:18] wanted to manifest yourself as the
[8:20] father oh Lord Jesus father you had to
[8:23] manifest yourself as the Healer you had
[8:26] to manifest yourself as the provider
[8:29] Lord Jesus because before the fall those
[8:32] attributes father they were just hidden
[8:34] in you father but they were ready they
[8:37] wanted father to be expressed you wanted
[8:40] father those attributes to come out
[8:43] father Lord to serve their purpose and
[8:45] father that's why a man Adam father full
[8:49] of he was the prophet says he was
[8:51] fortified by the word of God but when
[8:54] god father allowed the devil like he
[8:57] allowed father that said father in the
[9:00] days of job he allowed the devil father
[9:03] to come and father Lord reach that woman
[9:07] if father and father when she reached
[9:09] her father oh Jesus then your purpose of
[9:13] redemption started to work out we see

[9:55] the only begotten son on the Holy Spirit
[9:58] to believe
[9:59] that Jesus Christ has come in fresh oh
[10:03] Jesus Christ that is Father the essence
[10:06] of Faith to not realize that Jesus and
[10:10] God is the same because father at
[10:12] Calvary in the atonement that is when
[10:16] father Jesus and Christ meant Jesus and

[19:23] we may get
[19:25] seated amen amen so I want to take to
[19:28] pick it up from the Old Testament once
[19:32] again in chapter 41 of
[19:37] Genesis amen the scripture we read in
[19:40] John 16
[19:43] said that when the Holy
[19:45] Spirit when he come he will guide us
[19:49] through all
[19:51] truth amen so now here in the Book of
[19:55] Genesis chter 41
[20:00] here is the scripture talking about
[20:03] pharaoh and the dream that he had
[20:07] dreamed amen and the scripture says in
[20:10] verse
[20:12] one and it came to pass at the end of
[20:16] two full years that Pharaoh dreamed and
[20:19] behold he stood by the river
[20:33] and behold there came up out of the
[20:35] river seven well
[20:36] favored kind and flat fleshed and they
[20:40] fed in in
[20:48] [Music]
[20:50] a and behold seven other can came up
[20:54] after them out of the river ill favored
[20:57] and L fleshed and stood by the other can
[21:01] upon the brink of the
[21:16] river and Ill favored and lean fleshed
[21:20] kind did eat up the flesh well favored
[21:23] and F kind so Pharaoh awoke
[21:34] and he slept
[21:35] again and he slept and dreamed the
[21:38] second time and behold seven ears of
[21:40] corn came up upon One stock Rank and
[21:45] [Music]
[21:56] good and behold seven thin ear
[21:59] and blasted with the East Wind sprung up
[22:02] after
[22:16] them and the Seven thin ears divide the
[22:19] seven Rank and full ears and Pharaoh
[22:23] awoke and behold it was a dream
[22:37] and it came to pass in the morning that
[22:39] his Spirit was troubled and he sent and
[22:41] called for all the magans of Egypt and
[22:44] all the wise men thereof and Pharaoh
[22:47] told them his dream but there was none
[22:50] that could interpret them unto pharaoh
[23:10] then spoke the chief Butler unto Pharaoh
[23:13] saying I do remember my faults this day
[23:17] Pharaoh was rough with his servants and
[23:20] put me in what in the captain of the
[23:22] God's house both me and the chief beaker
[23:57] and we dreamed a dream in one night I
[24:01] and he we dreamed each one each men
[24:03] according to the interpretation of his
[24:13] dream and there was with us a young man
[24:16] an Hebrew servant the captain of the god
[24:19] and we told him and he interpreted to us
[24:22] our dreams to each man according to his
[24:24] dream he did interpret
[24:42] so now this was Joseph the Hebrew
[24:46] boy young man they were talking
[24:48] about so now here is Pharaoh he has a
[24:52] dream and the first Dream is
[24:55] confusing the Bible says again he slept
[25:00] and again he dream a
[25:01] dream and the second dream was much like
[25:04] the first
[25:07] Dream he called the magans and the wise
[25:09] men of the
[25:11] land he tried praise the Lord but he
[25:15] could not interpret the
[25:17] dream and Pharaoh became so furious
[25:21] with here is a
[25:23] man who
[25:25] remembered something that had happened
[25:29] the chief
[25:32] Butler he said I remember my
[25:36] faults this day then he began telling
[25:40] Pharaoh how he and his
[25:44] friend were in
[25:46] prison and how they had a dream each of
[25:50] them and how they spoke that dream to a
[25:53] young
[25:55] Hebrew Joseph
[25:58] interpreted
[26:00] dream and how they came to pass exactly
[26:03] the way they had
[26:05] dreamed praise the Lord And now when
[26:08] Pharaoh calls
[26:10] him he's able to tell Pharaoh the
[26:13] dream and the interpretation
[26:16] thereof when he had a
[26:18] dream he
[26:20] said praise the Lord I want us to get
[26:23] there and see how what what he answered
[26:25] he
[26:26] said Joseph answered pharaoh saying in
[26:28] verse
[26:29] 16 it is not in
[26:32] Me God shall give Pharaoh an answer
[26:45] of Praise the Lord so he
[26:49] recognized praise the Lord that it was
[26:52] not him that had ability to interpret
[26:56] the dream
[26:58] he recognized that it was
[27:00] God that had the power to go in the mind
[27:05] of a
[27:06] person to go ahead of time prise the
[27:09] Lord because the dream that Pharaoh
[27:13] had it was a future
[27:17] phenomenon it was something that was
[27:19] going to happen in the
[27:21] future it's only God it's only the holy
[27:25] spirit that has the ability to go ahead
[27:28] of
[27:29] time and bring things into
[27:33] existence and bring the things of the
[27:35] future and make them known unto us
[27:39] today praise the Lord so he said it is
[27:41] not in me but it is God and the God that
[27:46] I serve shall give Pharaoh an answer of
[27:51] this so he went ahead to tell him the
[27:55] interpretation he told him of the seven
[27:57] years
[27:59] plenty and the seven years
[28:02] ofine are going to hit the
[28:05] land and when Pharaoh heard it was so
[28:09] much
[28:10] amazed praise the Lord so we do two we
[28:13] see two things here that there was going
[28:15] to be a
[28:16] fine in the future praise the Lord
[28:20] around maybe 14 years
[28:23] ahead and then was going be of food
[28:28] and now there were a people of
[28:30] God that God must
[28:33] preserve praise the Lord and now there
[28:35] was also a
[28:37] Joseph who was in prison in a Strange
[28:41] Land and he was serving a
[28:47] sentence a he had not
[28:49] committed and now God gives a
[28:52] dream first of all the chief
[28:56] battler and Joseph interprets the
[29:00] dream and the CH leaves
[29:03] prison and Joseph remains in there then
[29:07] after some time when even this man had
[29:10] forgotten about
[29:12] Joseph after Pharaoh had pressed each of
[29:15] them now God reminds him that there was
[29:19] a man who did favor for
[29:22] you when you got this dream he
[29:25] interpreted and it got you out of prison
[29:30] when he remembered he told Pharaoh there
[29:33] is a man who I know can give this
[29:38] interpretation praise the Lord why
[29:40] because when he was with
[29:42] Joseph he saw the spirit that was in
[29:45] Joseph he saw that the spirit was very
[29:48] strange there was something special
[29:51] about
[29:52] Joseph that was not common with the rest
[29:54] of the
[29:55] people praise the Lord that Joseph was
[29:59] able to listen to The
[30:01] Dream he had the spirit which is the
[30:05] holy spirit which is God himself who was
[30:08] in position to look at the
[30:11] dream even if the dream was to happen
[30:14] 100 years
[30:16] ahead the spirit of God would get the
[30:19] event in 100 years time
[30:21] to and bring them now and be able to
[30:26] give the interpretation there of
[30:29] praise the Lord but we see that in all
[30:32] that Joseph never exalted
[30:35] himself he remained humble and
[30:39] recognized that it was not Joseph that
[30:41] was giving the interpretation of the
[30:43] dreams the God that was with him was the
[30:47] one that was able to interpret the
[30:50] dreams raise the name of the Living God
[30:53] so what do we notice here we see that
[30:57] Joseph
[30:58] as a humble servant of
[31:01] God Joseph as a man that was bearing the
[31:04] spirit of
[31:06] God was able to
[31:09] recognize the hand and the spirit of God
[31:11] that was with
[31:13] him but even when he noticed that he had
[31:16] something
[31:18] special he never exalted
[31:21] himself he still remained humble and he
[31:25] waited upon the Lord
[31:28] until when God could possibly bring it
[31:30] to
[31:32] happen that he get rescued from the
[31:35] prison praise the Lord and now if God
[31:39] was in
[31:40] position praise the Lord after he had
[31:43] given this dream to
[31:46] Pharaoh if God wanted to show Joseph
[31:50] the God would have given Joseph the
[31:53] dream interpretation but God got this
[31:56] dream
[31:58] gave it to Pharaoh praise the Lord such
[32:01] that
[32:02] Joseph praise the Lord it was time for
[32:06] Joseph to be
[32:08] recognized in the day that was
[32:11] living because if God had given Joseph
[32:15] the
[32:16] dream maybe Pharaoh would not would not
[32:19] appreciate
[32:20] it he would not accept it but if Pharaoh
[32:24] had a dream it is Joseph to come and
[32:29] give the
[32:30] interpretation the Bible tells us that
[32:33] God shall do
[32:35] nothing praise the Lord but he
[32:38] speaks he speaks all these Mysteries he
[32:43] all these Mysteries and he gives them
[32:46] unto his servants the
[32:47] prophet and now we appreciate that
[32:50] Joseph was a
[32:52] prophet because from the time when he
[32:54] was
[32:55] young he had these dreams
[32:58] he could for these
[33:00] things that's why he was hated of his
[33:03] brother praise the Lord but now when
[33:06] this time
[33:08] came God had to bring a future
[33:12] event bring it
[33:14] near and give it to Pharaoh in order for
[33:18] Joseph rescued out of
[33:20] prison it was not only to bring him out
[33:23] of
[33:24] prison but it was to elevate him to a
[33:27] position
[33:29] recognized in the rest of the
[33:31] land praise the name of the Living God
[33:34] so the Prophet Joseph confessed and
[33:38] said is not I but God shall give Pharaoh
[33:41] an answer of
[33:43] Peace God was God was was in Joseph and
[33:48] the spirit of God was upon him to give
[33:51] him
[33:52] direction to show him things that we are
[33:55] coming to pass to show him things that
[33:57] in the
[33:59] future to manifest the future
[34:02] events and show him what was coming
[34:05] along the
[34:06] way so the Holy Spirit goes ahead of
[34:10] time looks at the events that would
[34:13] be brings them closer to
[34:16] us with the eye of
[34:19] Prophecy and so Joseph confessed that it
[34:22] was not
[34:23] me but the spirit that is that is upon
[34:26] me and the god in me shall give the
[34:30] interpretation of the
[34:32] dream shall bring the secret in the
[34:34] dream to
[34:37] manifestation God has always done the
[34:40] same
[34:41] things prise the Lord we know that God
[34:44] has always chosen a special message in
[34:47] in in every
[34:50] age God chose Joseph in that
[34:54] day Joseph would be a savior for his
[34:57] people
[34:59] still
[35:00] Joseph be a
[35:02] light a star be a beacon of
[35:07] light of the light of God in the land of
[35:11] Egypt praise the Lord that when
[35:14] everybody
[35:15] heard what Joseph spoke about the
[35:19] dream they were all waiting for the
[35:22] manifestation of the
[35:24] dream but now we see something strange
[35:27] here
[35:28] that Pharaoh did not wait for the dream
[35:30] to come to
[35:31] pass when he had he looked at the
[35:35] knowledge and the
[35:37] wisdom with which Joseph gave the
[35:42] interpretation and recognized that
[35:44] Joseph was not
[35:46] alone but Joseph had the hand of
[35:50] God that
[35:52] testimony was enough to convince
[35:55] Pharaoh that the interpret
[35:58] that Joseph was
[36:01] giving was ordered of the
[36:04] Lord he believed him and he elevated him
[36:08] and he gave him Authority and he gave
[36:11] him Powers praise the Lord the testimony
[36:14] that people were carrying about
[36:17] Joseph about the mixed
[36:21] Spirit the special street that he was
[36:24] carrying was just enough to give a
[36:28] special
[36:29] testimony to pharaoh and the rest of the
[36:33] house this word that Joseph was
[36:37] car was the
[36:39] truth praise the Lord and now we also
[36:42] recognize that this same God who worked
[36:46] through Joseph he worked through so many
[36:49] prophets in the
[36:51] land he has visited so many
[36:54] prophets and could tell he could tell
[36:57] them
[36:58] things that we are going to happen in
[37:00] the
[37:01] future and could bring them closer and
[37:05] could make them known to the
[37:07] people the Lord and whatever he gave
[37:10] came perfectly exactly the way he
[37:14] mentioned we know that there was also a
[37:16] dream that Nebuchadnezzar
[37:18] had and still God
[37:22] elevated still elevated
[37:25] Daniel to come up praise the Lord the
[37:28] spirit of God was upon
[37:30] Daniel the spirit of God was in
[37:33] Daniel So Daniel got the dream and
[37:38] interpretation gave it unto him King
[37:42] Nebuchadnezzar was something that was
[37:44] going to happen in the
[37:46] future but God brought it down through
[37:49] the
[37:50] vision through the dream and he gave it
[37:53] unto Daniel and when Daniel spoke it
[37:58] believed that whatever Daniel spoke was
[38:02] the truth praise the Lord why when he
[38:06] looked
[38:07] atel and the wisdom with which Daniel
[38:11] spoke and their
[38:13] humility you recognize that there was a
[38:15] special Spirit upon
[38:17] Daniel praise the Lord what was that it
[38:20] was God working through his
[38:23] people try to give a
[38:25] direction of the that we are going to
[38:28] come to
[38:29] pass it was God in Daniel it was God in
[38:33] Joseph trying to show the
[38:36] Kings the things that we are going to
[38:39] come to
[38:40] pass many years
[38:42] ahead but he is a God praise the Lord
[38:46] the god that lives in
[38:48] us that lives in us he such a special
[38:52] God that he reveals these
[38:56] secrets prise the Lord the prophets and
[39:00] when the prophets when they come to
[39:01] speak to
[39:03] us praise the Lord they prophesy and
[39:06] whatever they speak comes to pass
[39:09] exactly as they have
[39:11] mentioned we have the prophet of our
[39:14] day very many years ago God gave him
[39:18] seven
[39:19] Visions he gave him visions of the
[39:21] things that we are coming to
[39:23] pass praise the Lord the spirit of God
[39:27] that was upon William
[39:30] Bram had the ability to go many years
[39:34] ahead and see the things that we are
[39:36] going to happen the things that you
[39:39] going to be the
[39:40] world then you could bring them down and
[39:44] showed them to the prophet praise the
[39:47] Lord and he would tell him these are the
[39:49] things that are going to come to pass
[39:51] and the prophet after he was
[39:54] convinced why because in
[39:58] in a dream the prophet would go ahead of
[40:03] time he could see things
[40:06] happening he see exactly things
[40:10] manifesting and so he was
[40:12] convinced by what he saw that he would
[40:15] come to pass that's when he could come
[40:17] tell the people I saw this it is says
[40:22] the Lord shall come to pass exactly the
[40:25] way he saw
[40:26] it in
[40:28] 1933 he gave him seven
[40:31] Visions praise the Lord and all the
[40:34] seven
[40:35] Visions prise the Lord we saw we saw one
[40:39] at at a go one at a time coming to
[40:43] happen exactly the way God has showed
[40:46] you the first Vision praise the Lord was
[40:51] M was a division about
[40:54] mine and his invasion of ethopia
[40:58] and in a message once
[41:01] more he says the Holy Spirit came one
[41:04] morning and told me seven things that
[41:06] would take place before this nation was
[41:11] destroyed one of them is that it's on
[41:16] it's on Old Paper there at the church
[41:19] and many has looked at
[41:22] it five of those things has perfectly
[41:26] been fulfilled exactly
[41:30] now would rise and go to
[41:34] ethopia fall at his
[41:37] steps and would be turned to the
[41:40] people in shame with a woman and many
[41:45] many years before it happened
[41:49] perfectly it's never failed and it would
[41:52] fail because it is th says the Lord and
[41:56] it is not contr to this
[41:58] Bible and another
[42:01] message church he
[42:04] says First Vision was that musin would
[42:07] invade
[42:09] Ethiopia and that and that Nation would
[42:12] fall at his
[42:14] steps that Vision surely did cause more
[42:19] repercussions and some were very angry
[42:21] when I said it would it would and would
[42:24] not believe it
[42:27] but it happened that way he just walked
[42:31] in there he just walked in there with
[42:34] his mod arms and took
[42:36] over the natives didn't have a
[42:40] chance but the vision also
[42:42] say that M would come to a horrible end
[42:45] with his own
[42:48] people standing on him that came to pass
[42:52] just exactly as it was
[42:54] saying now God had gone ahead of time
[42:59] and go the spirit of this
[43:02] messenger or the spirit of his
[43:05] servant and he carried it over ahead of
[43:08] time and he showed him how things were
[43:11] going to
[43:12] happen how would invade
[43:16] eia and how would come to
[43:19] end and it happened exactly the way he
[43:23] spoke and these are some of the facts
[43:25] about his happening
[43:28] there's a newspaper that writes and
[43:31] says praise the Lord ethopia ethopia
[43:34] which Italy had unsuccessfully tried to
[43:37] conquer in the
[43:42] 1890s was in
[43:44] 1934 one of the few independent states
[43:47] in European dominant
[43:54] Africa in the European dominated
[44:05] inant a b inant between Ethiopia and an
[44:08] Italian somal land that December gave
[44:11] Benito Molin an excuse to
[44:14] intervene there was a conflict
[44:16] between
[44:18] ethopia and Italian
[44:22] somand and the Italian somal
[44:25] land no no no no and and and somal and
[44:28] the Somali land Som ethopia and
[44:31] somal ethopia Somalia praise the Lord
[44:35] decle says it gave Benito an excuse to
[44:43] intervene rejecting allra
[44:48] offers Italians invaded on October 3rd
[44:56] 1935 under generals rodol
[45:00] once and Petro the invading forces
[45:03] steadily pushed back thearmed and poorly
[45:06] trained ethopian
[45:11] Army stead pushed back the ill ared and
[45:15] poor train ethopian
[45:20] Army winning a major victory near aangi
[45:25] on April 9th
[45:30] 1936 yes on April
[45:34] 9th
[45:36] 1936 taking
[45:40] the and on
[45:44] May the nation's
[45:46] leader
[45:48] Emperor went into
[45:52] Exile in
[45:54] Rome proclaimed Italy's King Victor
[45:57] Emmanuel emperor of
[46:03] ethopia so now we see that 1935 and
[46:10] 1936 35 and
[46:13] 36 around four years after the vision
[46:16] God had given the
[46:21] prophet invaded
[46:24] eia praise the Lord so now we see that
[46:27] the spirit of God went ahead of
[46:30] time you were to give
[46:32] leadership it was giving
[46:35] guidance praise the Lord guidance to the
[46:38] messenger of the
[46:39] day so now when he heard it and when he
[46:43] saw it he spoke it and three four years
[46:48] after became past exactly the way he
[46:51] said what was that it was God it was the
[46:56] Holy Spirit
[46:57] trying to give
[46:59] guidance praise the Lord trying to
[47:03] guide the scripture has said that when
[47:06] the Holy Spirit the spirit of
[47:10] truth comes upon us he shall guide us
[47:14] through all
[47:15] truth he shall be the
[47:17] teacher he shall point us to the way so
[47:21] now here
[47:23] 1933 that same Holy Spirit was giving
[47:27] guid us to the prophet of our day and he
[47:30] was showing him things that we going to
[47:33] come and they came to pass exactly the
[47:36] way he
[47:37] say praise the Living God there are so
[47:40] many articles that WR about this
[47:43] Invasion and their writing is very
[47:46] independent of what the prophet
[47:50] spoke in fact many of them may not even
[47:53] have known that there was a prophet who
[47:55] spoke about it
[47:58] but they wrote about the invasion of
[48:01] ethopia but we know that the prophet had
[48:03] spoken about
[48:04] it around 3 to four years
[48:08] ago praise the lord and there is another
[48:12] Vision about the rise of
[48:16] Hitler the prophet got this
[48:21] vision3 and he spoke about the rise of
[48:25] Hitler praise the Lord and how the
[48:27] dictator would take over
[48:30] German he would dra the world into
[48:33] war and it says it showed it showed the
[48:37] The Siege freight line and how our
[48:40] troops would have a terrible time to
[48:42] overcome
[48:45] it then it showed that Hitler would come
[48:48] to a mysterious
[48:51] end praise the Lord and still a few
[48:55] years after
[48:57] the way the prophet spoke about it it
[49:00] came to pass and it was an article that
[49:03] was
[49:07] published in the Holocaust
[49:11] encyclopedia how Hitler came to
[49:14] power and they narrated how the N party
[49:18] elector electoral succession made it
[49:21] difficult to govern German
[49:28] and how Hitler and Nazis refus to work
[49:31] with other political
[49:36] parties and how Hitler demanded to be
[49:38] appointed
[49:41] Chancellor how he he demanded to be
[49:50] appointed the German president PA
[49:55] V ini resisted this
[50:00] demand however he gave in and appointed
[50:02] Hitler as a chancellor of German on jary
[50:11] 30th and appointed Hitler to this
[50:13] position as the result of a political
[50:19] deal and
[50:21] later did not immediately become a
[50:24] dictator when he had become
[50:28] and the article says Germany's
[50:29] Democratic constition was still in
[50:35] effect however Hitler manipulated democ
[50:39] the Democratic political
[50:43] system and in August
[50:48] 1934 the president
[50:50] died and Hitler was he proclaimed
[50:53] himself
[50:55] leader of German and from that point
[50:59] forward he became a dictator of
[51:03] German but in
[51:06] 1945 he came to a horrible
[51:09] end and the article says until
[51:13] today there are sever conspir
[51:16] theories about his
[51:19] death others say he was exhumed to
[51:22] prevent from recognizing
[51:24] him he was exhumed put in or something
[51:32] like but witnesses that include his
[51:38] bodyguard pilot and
[51:40] [Applause]
[51:41] Commander he said in the in the
[51:45] back he said that he died in the
[51:49] backyard or the leaders
[51:52] Garden anded there with a bomb
[51:56] that may have consumed
[51:58] him and as of today there isn't a clear
[52:02] report about Hitler's
[52:05] death confirming the prophecy given in
[52:11] 1933 come horrible
[52:13] end God had given this Vision to
[52:16] [Applause]
[52:18] will later R around 12 years
[52:23] after had raised to power and he came to
[52:27] a mysterious end the way the prophet saw
[52:30] it in a vision and the third Vision
[52:33] speaks about the
[52:36] three he speaks about coming into
[52:41] play
[52:43] fism Nazism naism and communism
[52:47] communism praise the Lord and many years
[52:50] after each of these systems was coming
[52:53] to play
[52:56] it started with
[52:58] fism which describes
[53:02] capitalism capitalism the rise and
[53:04] dominance of Italy in World
[53:08] Systems which is of course the Roman
[53:10] religious
[53:13] movement active dominance of all
[53:19] systems which later led to the
[53:21] evolvement of
[53:24] Nazism and Nazism describes the great
[53:27] powers of
[53:29] Germany which later collapsed
[53:31] mysteriously at the hands of the
[53:33] Communist
[53:36] Russia and now when nazm Andis
[53:41] joined all lost to Russia's
[53:44] communism when Russia captured and put
[53:47] ADF Hitler's route an
[53:50] end and these things had been prophesied
[53:53] in 1933
[53:56] in a vision and later they came to pass
[53:59] exactly the prophet spoke
[54:02] about we saw the rise of the of we saw
[54:05] the rise of of Roman religious
[54:11] movement we saw the rise of Nazism in
[54:16] Germany praise the Lord when ad Hitler
[54:19] took
[54:20] over then we saw that these all lost to
[54:24] Russia
[54:27] the communism
[54:29] system when it came and took over and
[54:32] the prophet had mentioned about them in
[54:34] a
[54:36] vision God confirming his
[54:38] word praise the Lord that is there ever
[54:42] present with his
[54:44] Messengers ever present with his
[54:47] servants as the Holy Spirit who give
[54:50] them the
[54:51] direction praise the Lord he gives him
[54:54] the vision
[54:56] gives them inspiration and inspiration
[54:59] that he gives unto them comes to pass
[55:02] exactly the way they have spoken
[55:05] it because they are not speaking words
[55:07] of
[55:08] themselves they are speaking as thus
[55:11] says the
[55:12] Lord praise the Lord God comes down
[55:16] inside of them praise the Lord in form
[55:19] of the Holy
[55:20] Spirit and he Vis them and he takes them
[55:24] a little bit ahead of time
[55:27] he show them things he reveals things
[55:30] unto them praise the Lord and then when
[55:34] they listen to him they are
[55:37] convinced that it is God when they come
[55:40] down to bring the vision that they have
[55:43] received of
[55:45] God before the people to guide the
[55:49] people through the times and
[55:52] Seasons the holy spirit being our inside
[55:55] teacher
[55:57] guiding us through all
[55:59] truth praise the Lord and here comes
[56:01] another
[56:03] Vision fourth Vision speaking about the
[56:05] technology
[56:08] advancement with evolvement of a d
[56:13] car
[56:17] 1939 a company
[56:20] published their first driverless
[56:23] car praise the Lord and Vision that
[56:26] Prophet had
[56:28] seen came to pass six years
[56:31] later he saw another
[56:34] Vision about Mor
[56:36] Decay and it was so much lik to a
[56:41] woman it was speaking about moral
[56:44] Decay speaking about women and he says
[56:48] the vision had to do with moral problem
[56:50] of our
[56:54] ageing mostly around
[56:57] women God showed me that women began to
[57:00] be out of their
[57:03] place with the granting of the
[57:05] vote with the granting of the
[57:09] vote and we see the Clause of the 19th
[57:15] century we start witnessing
[57:19] movements advocating for women
[57:23] emancipation advocating for women uh
[57:26] equality gender
[57:28] equality trying to get women from their
[57:33] position blessing them at the same level
[57:35] as
[57:37] men God show the prophet and it came to
[57:41] pass
[57:43] exactly that even today we see so many
[57:47] women into active
[57:50] politics women leaving their
[57:53] position coming to take over positions
[57:55] that that belong to
[57:57] men and in the in the sixth
[58:00] division he saw the rise of a
[58:03] woman praise the Lord a woman in
[58:07] America a most
[58:09] beautiful but cruel
[58:11] woman and he says she held the people in
[58:14] her complete
[58:16] power I believe that was that this was
[58:19] the rise of the of the Roman Catholic
[58:23] Church though I knew it could possibly
[58:25] be a vision of some woman raising in
[58:27] great in
[58:31] America to popular
[58:34] vote praise the Lord and now around 45
[58:39] years 47 years we see a woman rising up
[58:43] in
[58:44] America like he said he Reon it maybe to
[58:47] a Roman Catholic
[58:50] church but maybe it could be a woman
[58:52] raising
[58:53] up in America with great power
[58:57] praise the Lord and in
[58:59] 2001 in
[59:02] 2001 we saw the rise of
[59:06] harala as one of the most powerful woman
[59:09] in
[59:10] America holding the one of the most
[59:13] powerful
[59:15] positions as the Vice President of
[59:17] America and we see today she's now
[59:21] advocating for the most powerful
[59:23] position in the whole world
[59:25] [Music]
[59:27] she's buying to be a president of the
[59:30] United States of America uned States of
[59:32] America and the prophet saw vision and
[59:35] around 45 years ahead of time the vision
[59:39] is coming to pass exactly the way he saw
[59:42] it what was that the Holy Spirit praise
[59:46] the Lord it has been good from the
[59:49] beginning and now God that was with with
[59:53] Joseph to see the visions see the dreams
[59:57] and see the
[59:59] interpretations and making things happen
[1:00:01] exactly the way he saw
[1:00:03] them the same God that was with
[1:00:06] Daniel the same God that was with job
[1:00:09] Jeremiah and the of the prophets it's
[1:00:12] the same God that was with William Bram
[1:00:16] trying to show him things that would
[1:00:18] come to
[1:00:19] pass the holy spirit being the
