[14:00] I was just sitting there in the seat and
[14:03] seeing everybody come to the front,
[14:07] all the pastors
[14:09] and and the song that that Tom quoted
[14:11] this morning
[14:13] said, "My eyes have seen the glory."
[14:17] And I thought, my I think my eyes are
[14:19] seeing the glory.
[14:25] I just feel like I need to sing that
[14:26] verse and the chorus before we start.
[14:34] You know that song?

[16:22] His truth is in you.
[16:26] It's marching
[16:28] at the feet of the gospel
[16:31] in line with the word.
[16:34] Marching where
[16:37] &gt;&gt; into eternity.
[16:40] Let's continue.
[16:43] To march on.
[16:46] Amen. It's just a joy to be here. Oh
[16:51] my goodness. God bless you.
[16:56] Thank you, brother Steven, Butter James,
[16:58] forc
[17:01] allowing us to be here.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Do you have to forgive me?
[17:09] &gt;&gt; I know you might have been expecting my
[17:11] dad.
[17:13] [Music]
[17:14] You just got the mini Tom tonight.
[17:20] [Music]
[17:22] I'm just giving I just letting dad get
[17:25] his strength back.
[17:33] Amen.
[17:37] Because I I know this morning
[17:40] you had a whole lot of food, spiritual
[17:42] food
[17:46] presented to you
[17:49] and you were eating this morning.
[17:53] What do you say?
[17:55] How do you say
[18:01] you
[18:08] Where did you steal it? Where where did
[18:11] you steal that word? Well, from you
[18:13] probably.
[18:19] [Applause]
[18:20] So, you're probably really full,
[18:27] but tonight maybe just a little cherry,
[18:32] just a little extra tonight.
[18:36] So don't tell the Lord tonight.
[18:44] You can say, "Lord,
[18:47] I need a little more."
[18:52] Then you can say, "I want
[18:56] you." Thank you. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. See, a little bit of
[19:05] Uganda, sorry. A little bit of Uganda
[19:09] was put inside me
[19:13] [Applause]
[19:18] for to be depositing yourselves into me.
[19:22] [Music]
[19:25] Amen.
[19:26] So then I, you know, I went in, you
[19:28] know, when brother Brandon speaks about
[19:29] going into the water
[19:33] and then he says, "Come in the water."
[19:36] [Music]
[19:38] &gt;&gt; So I had to go and get my dad.
[19:44] The water's hot.
[19:48] Amen.
[19:49] So it's just a privilege to be back
[19:53] to be back.
[19:56] Glory.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Are we ready for the word?
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; We're going to Romans 12.
[20:14] I have to make a little correction.
[20:18] I'm not correcting my dad,
[20:22] but I'm brother Tom's son.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; Not brother Tom is my dad.
[20:33] I
[20:33] &gt;&gt; I'm Brother Tom's son.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; That's how we'll introduce them.
[20:40] Amen.
[20:42] Amen. And I'm sure proud that he's my
[20:45] father.
[20:49] and the same fire that burns in him
[20:53] burns in me.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Not just natural genes,
[21:05] natural genes.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Let's read in Romans 12
[21:15] verse one.
[21:18] very familiar scripture
[21:23] says, "I beseech you therefore,
[21:25] brethren, by the mercies of God that you
[21:27] present your your bodies a living
[21:30] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[21:33] which is your reasonable service.
[21:42] [Music]
[21:50] Amen.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Verse two says, "And be not conformed to
[21:54] this world, but be ye transformed by the
[21:58] renewing of your mind, that ye may prove
[22:01] what is the good and acceptable and
[22:04] perfect will of God.
[22:16] [Music]
[22:22] Amen. Be not conformed to this world.
[22:27] But be ye transformed.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just bow our heads for a
[22:31] moment of prayer?
[22:35] Heavenly Father,
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Lord, tonight we are
[22:41] so desirous Lord that you come one more
[22:43] time
[22:47] Lord. We fed upon your word this
[22:48] morning,
[22:51] Lord. And as it's as we indeed the
[22:54] stimulation of your presence,
[22:58] Lord, lifted your people, Lord,
[23:02] strengthened them,
[23:04] nourish them.
[23:07] Lord, tonight we're just asking,
[23:10] you come just one more time,
[23:14] Lord. Somebody's heart is craving. Their
[23:19] soul is yearning.
[23:22] And Lord, just one word.
[23:26] Lord, when you speak one word,
[23:29] Lord, lives are completely changed.
[23:34] Lord, would you transform us tonight
[23:37] by the word of this hour?
[23:41] We commit the service to you now
[23:45] in Jesus Christ's name.
[23:47] Amen.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may have your seat.
[23:53] Can I take my coat off right away?
[23:57] &gt;&gt; I need to uh relax a little bit if I
[24:01] can.
[24:09] Yeah, brother Emanuel, too.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Emanuel has a special spot in my
[24:20] heart.
[24:21] [Music]
[24:23] He was my very first translator.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we had a good time.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; I had to learn
[24:33] to slow down. Amen.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Scripture says, "Be not conformed
[24:38] to this world."
[24:42] &gt;&gt; And if I could maybe title tonight's
[24:44] service,
[24:48] if I could say it's the pressure to
[24:51] conform
[24:56] versus eternity's call to transform.
[25:03] Because one thing is certain in this age
[25:05] is we're under pressure.
[25:10] This age is filled with pressure
[25:14] to bend you
[25:17] &gt;&gt; and to bend me
[25:20] and conform us
[25:23] to the social aspects or the social
[25:26] desires of this day.
[25:31] [Music]
[25:33] to define. I want to just I'm going to
[25:35] take the beginning a little bit slower
[25:40] because conform
[25:42] &gt;&gt; means to be in agreement with
[25:48] to conform is to be in harmony with
[25:50] something
[25:55] or obedient
[25:57] or compliant.
[26:01] It's
[26:02] to conform to something.
[26:07] It's for somebody to align themselves,
[26:12] your attitude,
[26:16] your belief,
[26:18] your behavior
[26:20] with the people around you.
[26:24] Okay? So human nature,
[26:28] we're kind of programmed
[26:33] to conform.
[26:36] We all want to be accepted.
[26:41] The human being desires acceptance.
[26:50] And so society throughout time
[26:56] has conformed
[26:59] to new ideas
[27:04] all through time.
[27:08] To give you an example,
[27:11] you know, in the middle ages,
[27:15] many hundreds of years ago,
[27:19] you know, everybody the the face, the
[27:21] forehead was the very central part of
[27:23] the body.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; And and they they they liked they they
[27:30] thought that that need to be um the
[27:32] focus.
[27:35] So they plucked their eyelashes
[27:38] [Music]
[27:40] and their eyebrow
[27:44] so that it would all just be smooth face
[27:51] because the idea
[27:54] was that was beautiful then.
[27:58] So soc society bent
[28:06] accepted the idea
[28:09] that that was a good thing to do
[28:14] in China
[28:16] if you would if you know there in the
[28:18] older days
[28:20] they would wrap their feet
[28:24] the ladies would wrap their feet
[28:26] &gt;&gt; the ladies
[28:27] &gt;&gt; oh
[28:31] so that you could marry early.
[28:36] Somehow they felt that if you you you
[28:38] wrapped your feet so they couldn't grow
[28:44] that that was a big deal.
[28:46] [Music]
[28:48] So all the ladies are wrapping their
[28:50] feet
[28:54] So they were conforming
[28:58] to the idea of the age
[29:03] and bending their belief
[29:09] to the pressure of that time.
[29:14] You see that all through history.
[29:20] You see it through wars.
[29:23] [Music]
[29:26] they actually call it
[29:29] the Lucifer effect
[29:35] because when somebody is in authority
[29:40] and they say hey do this it's okay you
[29:43] go do that
[29:46] person listens to the person in
[29:47] authority
[29:50] &gt;&gt; and just wants to conform
[29:54] and believes that what he's saying is
[29:56] okay.
[30:00] And they did that in World War II.
[30:03] Hitler says,
[30:07] [Music]
[30:08] Hitler said, "Take the Jews,
[30:12] go kill them." So the soldiers
[30:16] believed the authority
[30:19] that it was okay to do that.
[30:23] and they conformed
[30:26] to his will
[30:29] and they call that the Lucifer effect.
[30:37] And so humanity
[30:40] has a desire.
[30:44] If everybody's doing it,
[30:47] it's okay.
[30:49] You know, I can do that, too.
[30:52] you know, we don't want to have a
[30:53] negative social impact.
[30:56] [Music]
[30:58] I want to belong to a group.
[31:02] And so then people conform.
[31:07] Remember, scripture says, "Be not
[31:11] conformed
[31:14] to this world,
[31:18] &gt;&gt; but the norms of culture.
[31:23] It es and it flows.
[31:28] It changes with the tides of man
[31:34] to where it comes to a place.
[31:38] Where who's right?
[31:41] Is he right? Is he right? Who's right?
[31:47] I'm right.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; I do what I want to do.
[31:51] So everybody
[31:53] does their own thing
[31:56] and and people then be they don't have
[31:58] no tie post.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Nature
[32:05] proclaims
[32:07] there must be an absolute.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; There must be an absolute
[32:16] apost that you can go to.
[32:20] Not his idea,
[32:21] &gt;&gt; not his idea.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; That idea,
[32:25] &gt;&gt; but this idea,
[32:27] nature
[32:29] proclaims it
[32:32] because in the stars
[32:34] is a north star
[32:37] that stays in position.
[32:41] It doesn't drift with the night sky.
[32:44] It doesn't move with the seasons,
[32:47] but it stays constant.
[32:49] No matter where you are, you can look to
[32:52] the north star.
[32:55] You know your direction.
[32:59] Amen. But humanity
[33:03] has thrown away the compass.
[33:07] They've thrown away the compass
[33:10] and now they're wandering stars.
[33:14] But Abraham says,
[33:17] "Anything
[33:18] contrary to the word."
[33:21] &gt;&gt; He says, "Let me tell you something.
[33:24] This is the complete
[33:28] &gt;&gt; the complete divine
[33:32] revelation
[33:34] of God,
[33:36] &gt;&gt; his will and the coming of Christ
[33:40] and everything
[33:44] right in this book.
[33:47] He says, "If anything draws you off,
[33:51] throw that compass away.
[33:54] If anything takes you off this,
[33:57] moves you to some other man's idea,
[34:04] this remains true.
[34:09] I'm sorry, but if your compass is
[34:10] religion,
[34:14] you're going to be off track.
[34:18] And you can have religion right in the
[34:20] message.
[34:23] If I just believe the message, brother
[34:25] Michael.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; If I just believe the message,
[34:30] &gt;&gt; you can be your one man denomination in
[34:31] the message.
[34:36] Cuz the moment you inject one thought
[34:41] that deviates from the word of God,
[34:45] you denominated and hybrid.
[34:52] this word. We don't want to do that.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; So, it's not just enough to say, I
[34:58] believe the message,
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need to believe in me.
[35:07] Brother Abraham says
[35:12] &gt;&gt; if you're if it's only a paper that
[35:14] you're packing in your pocket
[35:18] [Music]
[35:20] talking about some creed,
[35:22] some idea,
[35:25] some dogma.
[35:28] He said, "Find the compass that sets you
[35:30] to the word.
[35:35] Can I just say this tonight?
[35:38] Show me a religion.
[35:41] Show me Buddhists,
[35:44] Hindus,
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Sikhs,
[35:47] Muslims,
[35:49] Catholics,
[35:50] some other religion
[35:53] that can display
[35:56] a living word.
[35:59] None of their religions point to a
[36:01] living God.
[36:04] story. But the Catholic system,
[36:10] they don't point you to a living God.
[36:14] They point to a dead god.
[36:17] They point to a tomb,
[36:20] but they can't point you to a living God
[36:24] that you heard this morning,
[36:27] a present God.
[36:29] They point you to some saint here
[36:32] or some saint there,
[36:34] but there's saints right here
[36:37] that are living with a message.
[36:41] [Applause]
[36:45] We've seen over you've seen over and
[36:48] over again.
[36:51] God has displayed himself in your midst.
[36:55] [Music]
[36:56] You've seen him displayed.
[37:00] You've seen God come down.
[37:03] You can't deny a living God.
[37:08] And if you need some more proof, show me
[37:10] another Bible
[37:16] that over 4,000 plus years
[37:21] from the beginning here.
[37:25] It was written here and written over
[37:27] 4,000 years.
[37:30] Every prophecy
[37:33] was fulfilled in Christ.
[37:37] You show me another book.
[37:40] Show me another scripture.
[37:43] Back in Adam's time,
[37:47] time
[37:49] in prophe prophecy,
[37:54] men that were burst.
[37:57] You think it's coincidence that Moses
[37:59] was a type of Christ?
[38:09] You think it's a coincidence that
[38:10] Joseph, every aspect of Joseph's life
[38:13] can convey the very image of Christ?
[38:25] No, it's not. It's divine order of God
[38:30] to you
[38:32] that this word is true.
[38:36] There's no other book. There's no other
[38:38] pamphlet.
[38:40] There's no other creed
[38:43] that can prove
[38:45] that he came today.
[38:52] Every type and shadow
[38:56] You go through the tabernacle,
[39:00] how it was, how everything was placed,
[39:03] the showbread,
[39:08] the sacrifice,
[39:11] the goat, the scapegoat, the lamb,
[39:18] everything
[39:20] lines perfectly
[39:22] and represents
[39:25] Jesus Christ
[39:27] in every detail.
[39:32] Show me some other religion
[39:35] that can prove itself like that.
[39:39] I'll save you the time.
[39:42] There is none.
[39:45] This alone
[39:47] is your compass.
[39:50] This alone
[39:56] Show me another God
[39:59] that can take a wretched sinner
[40:06] and change them into a new creature.
[40:09] Hallelujah.
[40:16] [Music]
[40:25] Why? Because religion
[40:29] conforms
[40:31] and it can take a man or a woman.
[40:35] It will bend them to conform a doctrine.
[40:42] This message
[40:44] transforms
[40:46] and can take a wretched sinner.
[40:50] It can take someone like me
[40:53] that was raised in a good home,
[40:56] &gt;&gt; but can reveal the word of this house
[41:01] and bring me to the recognition
[41:04] that I too need a savior.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. sinner. We're all born in sin.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Hold on. Hold on.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:29] [Music]
[41:38] [Applause]
[41:41] Amen.
[41:43] That's what brother Tom can say this
[41:45] morning.
[41:47] It's the same God that can deliver
[41:51] and can keep.
[41:54] He does it all.
[41:56] That's my God.
[42:01] Hallelujah.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says,
[42:03] &gt;&gt; "If I die in my tracks,
[42:07] if I die right here, right now,
[42:10] my absolute
[42:13] &gt;&gt; is Jesus Christ."
[42:16] Amen.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "If everybody,"
[42:22] &gt;&gt; someone said, "Billy, you preach such
[42:23] things as that,
[42:26] &gt;&gt; you're going to preach to the post of
[42:27] the church.
[42:30] Brother said, "I'll be preaching God's
[42:33] word to the post then
[42:38] because God is able
[42:41] of these posts
[42:44] to raise up children of Abraham.
[42:48] My God is more than able
[42:51] to pastor. Youth ministers and pastors
[42:55] preach the pure word.
[42:58] It don't matter who's in your church.
[43:01] If it's the two people,
[43:04] God will raise up a church.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; As you heard this morning,
[43:10] God cares about his seed.
[43:15] Two, 10,000.
[43:19] The word
[43:21] draws them in.
[43:24] Amen.
[43:25] [Applause]
[43:34] [Applause]
[43:38] Amen.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Dr. Davis said to brother Brandham,
[43:49] &gt;&gt; he says, "You think they're going to
[43:51] believe you?"
[43:54] Brother Brandham said, "It's not my
[43:55] business.
[43:56] [Music]
[43:58] It's my business
[44:00] to stay true to the word.
[44:04] It's not my business
[44:06] to worry about who believes in what?
[44:09] It's your business to stay true to God.
[44:15] Why? So that truth
[44:19] truth can march on.
[44:23] Amen. Amen.
[44:29] Hallelujah.
[44:32] Praise the Lord.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Michael.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Mike.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; I'm a nonconformist.
[44:39] [Music]
[44:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care what people say this way or
[44:42] not.
[44:45] I have my own idea.
[44:47] [Music]
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[44:52] Then you just put yourself in the
[44:53] judges.
[44:56] But Abrandom said, "Every man done right
[44:58] in his own sight."
[45:03] Not a good place to be.
[45:06] He says, "The reason they did that
[45:09] judges."
[45:12] He said, "This might shock you just a
[45:13] little bit,
[45:16] but he said the reason they did it
[45:20] because they had no prophet
[45:24] in them days
[45:26] for the word of the Lord to come to
[45:32] there was no prophet."
[45:34] because you heard this morning.
[45:37] The word is revealed to his servants.
[45:42] So they didn't have a prophet.
[45:44] So they just did what they thought was
[45:46] right.
[45:50] He said, "And that's exactly what's
[45:51] happened today."
[45:54] I want you to recognize the date here.
[45:58] And this will just tie into this
[46:00] morning.
[46:01] [Music]
[46:03] 62 62
[46:04] &gt;&gt; 1962
[46:07] December 30th
[46:08] [Music]
[46:11] &gt;&gt; he's rolling into 63
[46:15] [Music]
[46:17] in 62.
[46:20] But Abraham says we don't have the
[46:22] prophet in these days of denomination
[46:27] but God promised us one.
[46:31] He would rise up and send Elijah back on
[46:34] the scene
[46:38] and turn the hearts back
[46:42] &gt;&gt; to the father.
[46:44] And the word
[46:47] in 63
[46:49] was going to begin the unveiling.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet was there.
[46:57] God was setting it up.
[47:00] vindicating
[47:03] &gt;&gt; so that you and me have no question.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; So when the word was open
[47:12] and he started to reveal the the the
[47:15] message of this hour
[47:18] and his seals to be loose.
[47:20] God had spent time
[47:24] vindicating.
[47:26] So when it came, you could say it's all
[47:29] true.
[47:31] It's all true. I can believe it. I can
[47:35] believe those mysteries being
[47:38] God stepped behind him,
[47:43] year,
[47:45] year after year,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; so that you don't have a question.
[47:57] prophet has to come whether you like it
[47:58] or not.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; No one liked Elijah.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; No one like Micaiah.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; No one like Jeremiah.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; No one liked Isaiah.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Amos.
[48:19] You name it.
[48:21] Tell me one prophet in scripture
[48:24] that the the that this that the the
[48:26] humanity didn't hate.
[48:30] Ahab, come on, Micaiah.
[48:33] Why are you speaking evil things of me
[48:34] all the time?
[48:36] Tell me good things. All these prophets
[48:39] tell me good things.
[48:42] But where would you want to stand?
[48:45] &gt;&gt; I want to stand beside Mia.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; I want to stand beside Isaiah.
[48:51] I want to stand beside Jeremiah
[48:54] cried out and said destruction come
[48:59] repent of your sin. Sorry,
[49:01] &gt;&gt; repent of your sins.
[49:04] Jeremiah,
[49:06] our prophet has said we're going to
[49:09] crush them.
[49:11] In fact, I've got a yoke of iron.
[49:15] What do you believe?
[49:20] History says,
[49:22] &gt;&gt; "I want to stand with a minority.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; I want to stand with a prophet that
[49:27] stood alone."
[49:31] &gt;&gt; So don't be surprised
[49:34] when in this day and age,
[49:37] the enemy comes in like a flood
[49:41] against the word of this house.
[49:45] It's just scripture.
[49:49] be comforted.
[49:52] It's scriptural.
[49:55] [Music]
[49:58] And
[49:58] &gt;&gt; so, a word came
[50:00] to awaken us
[50:03] from the sliding away
[50:09] or the conforming
[50:13] away from the word.
[50:18] You know, it isn't news to you
[50:24] that biblical truths of scripture
[50:30] that were once normal
[50:36] are now labeled old-fashioned
[50:41] or even outlawed.
[50:43] [Music]
[50:51] It was normal
[50:55] that women wore dresses and modesty.
[51:00] It was normal.
[51:02] But the world
[51:05] is out to conform you.
[51:08] So the new normal
[51:12] is provided.
[51:15] And you see every sort of dress,
[51:19] but scripture said, "A woman shall not
[51:22] wear that which pertains to a man.
[51:27] Neither
[51:30] shall a man put on a woman.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I come from a country
[51:38] that is so perverted
[51:41] that it's normal
[51:44] for a man to put on a woman's garment.
[51:55] You chuckle, you laugh,
[51:59] but that's Vancouver.
[52:04] And in God's eyes,
[52:06] &gt;&gt; it's an abomination.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; It's wretched.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; And you as men
[52:15] would see a man dressed like a woman and
[52:19] you would want to wretch.
[52:23] God wants to wretch.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; You know what? When a woman puts on
[52:29] man's garments,
[52:32] God still wants to wretch.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; It's the same.
[52:39] It's the same.
[52:42] It hasn't changed,
[52:46] &gt;&gt; but the world has changed.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; It's okay. Okay, the rest of the world's
[52:52] doing it.
[52:55] Young people,
[52:57] you got so much pressure
[53:00] that you align with the world's social
[53:02] norms.
[53:05] Your language,
[53:07] &gt;&gt; how you talk,
[53:09] how you act,
[53:11] makeup and fashion,
[53:15] all these aspects that pressure you.
[53:18] [Music]
[53:22] You get on your phone
[53:25] You're going through all your social
[53:26] media
[53:28] and it's pressure. Pressure pressure. I
[53:31] got to be like that person. I got to be
[53:34] like that.
[53:37] I want to fit in.
[53:40] I don't want to be I don't want to be
[53:41] scorned.
[53:42] I don't want to be mocked.
[53:45] Pressure.
[54:08] Amen.
[54:11] I could go through scripture
[54:14] whether it's headship
[54:16] headship
[54:19] the proper order of the home,
[54:23] &gt;&gt; the order of the home
[54:25] [Music]
[54:27] or the relationship
[54:30] of a marriage
[54:33] &gt;&gt; or even down to this down to even gender
[54:38] there. Brother Brandham says it's
[54:39] perversion.
[54:42] I'm going to read you a quote from 1965.
[54:47] This is 1965.
[54:52] That's a long time ago.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; You would say that's oldfashioned times.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; He says human perversion.
[55:04] Women don't even know what sex they
[55:06] belong to.
[55:28] Uganda.
[55:38] Amen.
[55:42] 1965.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine sitting right here
[55:49] in that service?
[55:52] It would curl your hair if it was
[55:54] straight.
[55:56] And if your hair was curly, it would go
[55:58] straight.
[56:02] You'd say,
[56:05] "We're in 1965.
[56:08] We got perfect family." unit,
[56:12] but a prophet
[56:14] with eyes to see
[56:17] our
[56:20] so that you
[56:23] &gt;&gt; would not conform
[56:27] to this world's ideas.
[56:31] Bringing the scripture
[56:34] to life in this day.
[56:38] What confidence you can have
[56:42] to know that God saw this hour.
[56:47] You can read that message.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And you're not saying, "Oh, that's old
[56:52] time."
[56:54] You're like, "That's right now."
[56:59] Right now.
[57:04] [Applause]
[57:06] So then I wonder
[57:09] maybe the question needs to be asked,
[57:14] have my norms
[57:17] been altered?
[57:28] You're under extreme pressure
[57:32] of an age
[57:35] and you're
[57:44] and the pressure is starting to build.
[57:48] [Music]
[57:50] It s forces
[57:53] you to buckle.
[57:57] because that's what pressure will do.
[58:02] Couple years ago,
[58:05] there was an expedition to the Titanic.
[58:08] [Music]
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe you heard it in the news. I don't
[58:12] know.
[58:14] But a small group of people
[58:18] &gt;&gt; went into a submersible machine
[58:22] and they wanted to go down to the
[58:24] Titanic
[58:29] and that about two and a half miles
[58:30] deep.
[58:34] Maybe that's like four plus kilometers.
[58:39] The pressure
[58:41] got so great.
[58:45] They say
[58:47] &gt;&gt; that that pressure at 4 km under the
[58:50] water
[58:53] is equal to
[58:56] 35 elephants on your back.
[59:05] So, can you
[59:07] can you imagine standing right here
[59:11] and somebody took an elephant on my
[59:12] back?
[59:15] Do you know what would happen to me?
[59:18] I'd be about that thin
[59:23] and then another elephant.
[59:26] And another elephant,
[59:29] another elephant.
[59:31] 35,
[59:36] &gt;&gt; but there was a crack.
[59:40] There was a malfunction
[59:44] and it couldn't handle the pressure
[59:49] and the whole thing blew
[59:53] in a moment.
[59:58] Everything in that submarine
[1:00:05] gone.
[1:00:18] I want to tell you this evening,
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; the pressure that Satan's putting on you
[1:00:28] is greater
[1:00:32] greater
[1:00:34] than 35 elephants.
[1:00:37] the pressure of this world
[1:00:41] pressing you
[1:00:43] and you go through maybe circumstances.
[1:00:48] You go through a situation.
[1:00:50] Young people, you go to school
[1:00:53] and the peer pressure
[1:00:56] along with the crowd
[1:00:59] and Satan's pressing
[1:01:04] and you like, I don't know if I can take
[1:01:05] it.
[1:01:07] It's too much for me.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; I'm buckling
[1:01:14] and some
[1:01:19] explode.
[1:01:25] Sometimes
[1:01:27] even inside church
[1:01:32] there's a pressure
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; to conform
[1:01:37] to the acceptable
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; atmosphere.
[1:01:41] [Music]
[1:01:46] Someone comes into church.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; This is where your friends are.
[1:01:52] This is where your family is.
[1:01:54] You clap.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; We sing.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Everyone else does.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; You know, we come to church on Sunday.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; I don't go to the parties. You don't you
[1:02:09] know, you don't you do.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; It's rich young ruler.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; I do all that.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Rich young ruler.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:02:24] And because of the external pressure,
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:31] you just conform
[1:02:35] to the atmosphere,
[1:02:38] but not a transform.
[1:02:44] You will just walk through life,
[1:02:47] but something will come
[1:02:50] and Satan will start the pray.
[1:02:54] And at some point,
[1:03:03] maybe it's a mental break.
[1:03:08] Marriage breaks.
[1:03:11] They'll leave the message.
[1:03:13] We've seen people, they break, they
[1:03:15] leave and leave and don't even believe
[1:03:16] God anymore
[1:03:20] because the pressure to conform.
[1:03:29] They conformed to a message.
[1:03:33] They conformed to just religiosity.
[1:03:38] If Satan comes and he wants to put the
[1:03:42] pressure on,
[1:03:44] find the area
[1:03:47] to break them.
[1:03:52] It's dangerous
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; to live in a conforming.
[1:03:58] [Music]
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you
[1:04:06] there's a greater power.
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:10] There is a greater power
[1:04:15] for
[1:04:18] because scripture said
[1:04:21] Be ye not conformed
[1:04:24] to the things of this world,
[1:04:26] but there's something greater than that.
[1:04:30] Because if I can transform,
[1:04:33] if I can deposit something inside of
[1:04:35] you,
[1:04:38] all the pressure
[1:04:41] is exerted on you.
[1:04:45] Something inside you
[1:04:48] pushes out
[1:04:51] It's called a light.
[1:04:54] The word inside you is greater than the
[1:05:00] pressure
[1:05:01] to conform.
[1:05:03] [Applause]
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:30] [Applause]
[1:05:33] But it requires
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; good.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; It requires
[1:05:41] a renewing
[1:05:45] of the mind.
[1:05:48] a fire to burn
[1:05:53] because it's an inside process,
[1:05:57] not something just on the outside,
[1:06:00] not just a following rules,
[1:06:04] just following my family.
[1:06:07] Fire
[1:06:09] that can renew your mind
[1:06:13] so that no matter who's around you,
[1:06:18] You follow the word
[1:06:21] every single time.
[1:06:30] [Applause]
[1:06:38] [Applause]
[1:06:41] Not a filtered mind
[1:06:47] where the word gets spoken
[1:06:50] and you're like, "Well, that's a little
[1:06:51] strong.
[1:06:54] I don't know if I can do all,
[1:06:58] you know, a renewed mind."
[1:07:02] Brother Brandham said, "If we love the
[1:07:05] fashions of the earth,
[1:07:10] if we love the trend of the day,
[1:07:17] think about it,
[1:07:19] current days norm."
[1:07:25] He says, "Oh, this is wonderful time.
[1:07:29] If you think that,
[1:07:31] he said it's because your thinking is
[1:07:33] wrong.
[1:07:35] He said, remember,
[1:07:38] he said, for if you love the world's
[1:07:40] order
[1:07:42] and the things of this present world
[1:07:46] because the love of God's not even in
[1:07:47] you.
[1:07:49] Amen. We don't want to filter
[1:07:52] the thoughts of God,
[1:07:54] not some podcast,
[1:07:58] not some celebrity.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; I only want my mind renewed
[1:08:07] by this word.
[1:08:09] That's it.
[1:08:12] Young people,
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; young people, I can't stress it enough.
[1:08:17] [Music]
[1:08:19] Your generation is under so much
[1:08:22] pressure.
[1:08:26] I want to tell you tonight,
[1:08:29] you can stand the pressure,
[1:08:36] but what you need
[1:08:39] is not your thought,
[1:08:41] your strength,
[1:08:43] your might.
[1:08:45] What you need is a transforming power.
[1:08:53] But says
[1:08:56] if you haven't got an absolute
[1:09:01] an experience,
[1:09:06] he says that he says that you claim
[1:09:12] you have
[1:09:13] and you can deny everything of this
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:18] He says you have he says you're trusting
[1:09:20] upon a bachelor of art degree.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; If you're trusting on your degree
[1:09:27] if you're trusting on your thoughts,
[1:09:30] oh the days of miracles are passed
[1:09:34] and no divine healing.
[1:09:37] He says, "If that's all you've got,
[1:09:42] you need a Damascus road experience
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; that nobody
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; can take away."
[1:09:56] Paul
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; was a conformer.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; He had traditions.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; He followed them to the letter.
[1:10:09] And he acted in opposition
[1:10:14] to the very word of God.
[1:10:17] But his mind, his idea,
[1:10:21] he thought
[1:10:23] was falling right.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; But then a pillar of fire
[1:10:30] came across his way
[1:10:32] and it altered.
[1:10:35] had completely changed
[1:10:38] his thinking
[1:10:40] and took this same word.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; That's what it means.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; It's not my concept.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; He was a blasphemer.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; He was an attacker.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; A despiser,
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; a hater,
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; an antagonist.
[1:11:04] fighting the very God he thought he
[1:11:07] served.
[1:11:11] But one day,
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; one day,
[1:11:21] he was going with purpose. He was on his
[1:11:24] horse. He thought he was doing things
[1:11:26] right.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; All right, come with me, boys. We want
[1:11:30] to take down the Christians.
[1:11:32] And then out of nowhere,
[1:11:35] pillar of fire.
[1:11:37] Says, "Sorry, Paul. You don't got it the
[1:11:39] way you think. I'm going to give you my
[1:11:42] thoughts.
[1:11:44] Why are you fighting against me, Paul?
[1:11:47] I've come to renew you.
[1:11:50] To transform you,
[1:11:52] to take you.
[1:11:55] I need you to get on.
[1:11:58] I'm going to put you on a new horse,
[1:12:01] a new power.
[1:12:03] is going to take you.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; I need you to lead my people.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; The same pillar of fire has come at this
[1:12:12] hour
[1:12:14] so that you
[1:12:16] with the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:12:19] Take the same word
[1:12:22] because you've been transformed.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:31] Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; You know there's an account brother
[1:12:36] Brandham speaks about
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; a a story.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; about the little girl
[1:12:47] young lady I should say
[1:12:50] and she was in an emergency room.
[1:12:56] She was in an insane asylum.
[1:13:00] Brother Brandham says maybe 30 cases of
[1:13:02] insanity around.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; He said she was from the psychopathic
[1:13:10] psychopathic.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; She had problems.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; She had problems.
[1:13:24] maybe 20, 25 years old.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; She's a place where crazy people go.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; That's where she was.
[1:13:37] Brother Brandon says, "How do you do?"
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; She said, "How do you do?"
[1:13:44] She says, "Could you listen to my story
[1:13:46] a moment?"
[1:13:48] Brother says, "Certainly."
[1:13:51] And he said she started to tell him,
[1:13:54] "She was raised in a good home.
[1:13:57] My mother taught me not to do wrong,
[1:14:00] to shun evil,
[1:14:02] embrace the right thing."
[1:14:05] She says, "I lived that kind of life for
[1:14:07] a number of years,
[1:14:11] conforming.
[1:14:14] I just did what was right.
[1:14:17] I was raised in a good home.
[1:14:20] conforming.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Then she started
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; she got mixed up with a young man
[1:14:28] because
[1:14:30] conforming
[1:14:32] can't hold you.
[1:14:37] Young man comes by her way.
[1:14:40] Off she goes.
[1:14:43] Then she said she started she says I
[1:14:45] just throw myself away.
[1:14:47] I became an alcoholic.
[1:14:50] And then the good shepherds or they
[1:14:52] throw me to the Catholic institution,
[1:14:53] Good Shepherds
[1:14:56] and I was under correction
[1:15:00] and she just was conforming
[1:15:05] and they let her go
[1:15:07] drinking again.
[1:15:10] Then she says, "I changed from Catholic
[1:15:11] to Protestant."
[1:15:15] And then the chaplain started to talk to
[1:15:17] me and I came out and I tried again.
[1:15:22] She tried to conform
[1:15:24] again.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; But her brand says, "Where's your
[1:15:28] mother?" She's dead.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; She's dead. She says, "Oh, if I could
[1:15:34] only go back again."
[1:15:38] But Abraham says, "A lovely young woman
[1:15:39] like you. Don't you desire to be
[1:15:41] married?"
[1:15:44] Have babies like a mother.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; She said, "Oh, I'd love to, sir.
[1:15:51] What could I look offer anybody? Look at
[1:15:53] me."
[1:15:57] But Brand says, "You have one thing that
[1:15:59] you can offer."
[1:16:03] So he said, "What's that?" He said,
[1:16:05] "You're sold to Christ.
[1:16:09] She said, "Sir,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; he wouldn't receive it."
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; She conformed
[1:16:19] pressure. Conformed
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; pressure. She's broke
[1:16:26] to a place.
[1:16:28] Brother Brand said, "Just give your soul
[1:16:29] to him.
[1:16:31] Give your soul to Christ."
[1:16:34] Said he'd never receive.
[1:16:37] I've gone too far.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; I love Brother Brandon's response.
[1:16:44] [Music]
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh yes, he will."
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; You have never
[1:16:56] never gone too far.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; There's a yearning there.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; You could be sitting in this service
[1:17:04] tonight.
[1:17:06] Whatever said in a quote, "Just the fact
[1:17:09] that you're here
[1:17:11] shows that you have not crossed any
[1:17:12] line.
[1:17:15] Just the fact that you're here."
[1:17:19] The word in her day
[1:17:21] was before her.
[1:17:25] I've gone too far. Oh, no. No. He'll
[1:17:28] hear you.
[1:17:30] He wants to transform you.
[1:17:33] Brother Brandon said, "You're just
[1:17:36] turning pages."
[1:17:40] That's conforming.
[1:17:43] But you really come to him.
[1:17:47] Oh, she says, "What could he do with me?
[1:17:50] I'm too far gone."
[1:17:53] I said he can take you back
[1:17:55] [Music]
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; to the time when you were an innocent
[1:17:59] girl.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; God's transforming power
[1:18:06] can bring you back to the point.
[1:18:09] It erases all your history.
[1:18:13] It erases your past,
[1:18:16] your drinking, your alcohol,
[1:18:19] your issues with relationships.
[1:18:22] Whatever your situation,
[1:18:25] my God can transform your life
[1:18:30] and make you a virgin.
[1:18:36] Oh my. He says the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; is sufficient
[1:18:42] and powerful
[1:18:44] to to transform
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; the vilest sinner
[1:18:51] guillless.
[1:18:54] I don't know what your issues are
[1:18:55] tonight,
[1:18:56] but if there's one young lady or one
[1:18:59] young man, I'm telling you tonight,
[1:19:03] this word,
[1:19:05] this message has the power to bring you
[1:19:09] back to your ought to be placeless.
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:18] But maybe your response,
[1:19:23] you said, "I've tried
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; too many times."
[1:19:31] That's what she said to brother
[1:19:32] Brandham. "I've tried
[1:19:35] too many times."
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:40] Brother Brham says, "I want to tell you,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; I believe your case has never been
[1:19:44] diagnosed right.
[1:19:49] He said, "You don't want to be like
[1:19:50] that."
[1:19:52] She said, "Certainly not." I said, "You
[1:19:55] don't want to be like that."
[1:19:58] And if your seed inside,
[1:20:00] your response is, "Certainly not."
[1:20:05] He says, "You don't have to."
[1:20:07] He says,
[1:20:10] "This may sound old-fashioned."
[1:20:14] He said, "It's the devil that's done
[1:20:15] that to you.
[1:20:18] He's got a hold of you,
[1:20:20] driving you to things you don't want to
[1:20:22] do."
[1:20:27] That's the diagnosis
[1:20:30] from the prophet.
[1:20:33] She looked at me with those big eyes.
[1:20:37] She says, "I've always believed that's
[1:20:39] the truth.
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:44] It's the devil
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; causing pressure
[1:20:50] driving you to do things you don't want
[1:20:53] to do.
[1:20:55] [Music]
[1:20:57] She said I'm a mental case.
[1:21:01] Brother Bram says you are
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; but I said Jesus Christ
[1:21:08] restores
[1:21:11] mind.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; He said there's nothing too great for
[1:21:17] him.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Do you think you'd do that for me?
[1:21:23] Do you think you'd do that for me?
[1:21:27] Tell you not in the history books.
[1:21:32] But can I point to so many
[1:21:35] that had the same situations
[1:21:38] that the mind needed to be restored?
[1:21:42] You were in sin,
[1:21:44] in alcohol,
[1:21:46] in drugs, immoral living,
[1:21:49] in religion,
[1:21:51] in religiosity.
[1:21:55] But Jesus
[1:21:57] came by your way.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; How? like a church age book drops
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; into the hand of your pastor. What did
[1:22:07] it do? It transformed him. It drew him
[1:22:13] to the pole of eternity.
[1:22:21] Why? Because there was seed
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:27] that was pulling
[1:22:31] draw him.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; That's what brought a prophet to this
[1:22:36] young lady.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, so she tried.
[1:22:47] She prayed for a few moments. Oh Lord,
[1:22:50] Lord, I just want to start a new one.
[1:22:53] Would you please God? She had some
[1:22:55] words.
[1:22:57] She says, "Brother Ram, Brother,
[1:23:04] I'm going to do a new start."
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; But says, "Sister,
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; it's not going to do you a bit of good."
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; He says, "You're just going exactly the
[1:23:18] same road you've been on.
[1:23:24] I mean it from my heart.
[1:23:28] Brother says, "I know you do."
[1:23:32] This is the word.
[1:23:35] Delving deep,
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; past the mind,
[1:23:41] past the spirit realm,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; and it's going to the soul.
[1:23:46] [Music]
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "But the devil's stronger than
[1:23:50] any mental power.
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:56] The reason I don't believe in
[1:23:58] intellectual religion,
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:04] he says it's got to go deeper than
[1:24:06] you're thinking.
[1:24:11] He said it's got to be an experience.
[1:24:16] She said, "What must I do?"
[1:24:20] I said, "Stay right there.
[1:24:23] And he said, "We prayed
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; and we prayed."
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham went to other places
[1:24:29] now. He prayed with some other people.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And he came back and she was still
[1:24:35] praying and he goes around back and he
[1:24:38] comes back to her again. And after a
[1:24:41] while,
[1:24:43] she got desperate.
[1:24:47] Lord, I just want to turn a new page.
[1:24:49] [Music]
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; She got desperate.
[1:24:52] and she prayed. She said, "Lord, I'm not
[1:24:55] moving from here. I want to be like
[1:24:57] Jacob.
[1:24:58] I don't want to just be walking my
[1:25:00] thoughts,
[1:25:02] but I need to take hold of the angel.
[1:25:05] I've got to stay hold of the word."
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; And she stayed there.
[1:25:10] And after a while,
[1:25:12] she was getting deeply sincere
[1:25:18] and she raised up and her tears are
[1:25:21] falling from her cheeks
[1:25:23] and she looked me in the face
[1:25:26] and she says, "Brother Brandon got
[1:25:27] brother, something's happened.
[1:25:31] What happened?
[1:25:33] Transformation,
[1:25:37] not confirmation.
[1:25:40] transformation
[1:25:42] then she don't even know what what
[1:25:45] happened
[1:25:47] my desires have changed
[1:25:49] my thoughts
[1:25:52] what what just took place I'll tell you
[1:25:55] what took place it's called the Holy
[1:25:57] Spirit came
[1:25:59] and abode
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; into her soul I would say young person
[1:26:08] old
[1:26:09] I don't care who you are. If the
[1:26:11] transformation of God
[1:26:14] does not happen,
[1:26:17] at some point
[1:26:20] you break.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; But if you are transformed
[1:26:27] you, he will never break.
[1:26:39] because the word ripened within your
[1:26:41] heart.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham says to bring forth
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; and live
[1:26:51] what you're talking about
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:26:58] because inside of you
[1:27:02] creates a force.
[1:27:03] [Music]
[1:27:07] You become the word.
[1:27:10] [Music]
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know that's a big one to swallow,
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; but the word's deposited in you. So,
[1:27:23] and in the evil increases,
[1:27:28] but I want to say to you,
[1:27:31] you're unalterable.
[1:27:35] it.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You can't alter it.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; You can't change it.
[1:27:40] See, someone that's conformed.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Who know who who's ever had a balloon in
[1:27:47] their hand?
[1:27:49] Had a balloon in their hand.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; It's got air in it.
[1:27:54] You can kind of press it. Kind of. It
[1:27:57] kind of changes.
[1:27:59] So, I push it this way. It goes like
[1:28:01] that. I push it this way.
[1:28:05] You know what I mean? It can be altered.
[1:28:10] It can be adjusted with the pressure.
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:16] But when you're transformed,
[1:28:19] you can't be altered.
[1:28:23] So, Satan tries to place his hands on
[1:28:25] you
[1:28:27] and he starts to squeeze
[1:28:30] and he places you through a situation.
[1:28:33] You got to work through situation, a
[1:28:35] financial situation, maybe a son or
[1:28:38] daughter that's called.
[1:28:43] You know what a son and daughter does?
[1:28:47] No change.
[1:28:50] No change.
[1:28:51] Because inside
[1:28:53] is an equal force
[1:28:56] resting out there.
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:00] I'm going to give you a little
[1:29:01] difference.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; The scripture says
[1:29:06] for such are false apostles,
[1:29:10] deceitful workers
[1:29:13] transforming themselves.
[1:29:15] Look at transforming
[1:29:18] into the apostles of Christ.
[1:29:22] Oh,
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, brother Michael,
[1:29:23] brother,
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; what does that mean?"
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; They're transforming
[1:29:29] and no marvel
[1:29:32] for Satan himself
[1:29:35] is transformed
[1:29:37] into an angel of light.
[1:29:40] That That's scripture. I just read
[1:29:41] scripture.
[1:29:43] But I want you, you have to, you have to
[1:29:45] dig into scripture
[1:29:48] because that word transformed in that
[1:29:51] verse
[1:29:53] [Music]
[1:29:55] is a Greek word.
[1:29:58] It means to change the outward form.
[1:30:04] Satan can change the outward form.
[1:30:10] It's like this. Who has a garden?
[1:30:12] Anybody have a garden?
[1:30:16] So, we have some Okay. Okay.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; So, say you have a garden
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; and you want to change your garden
[1:30:24] to look like an Italian garden.
[1:30:30] It's still a garden.
[1:30:32] You've just changed its outward.
[1:30:37] Okay.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; That's the word that the Greek is using.
[1:30:43] Okay. But the word there's another word
[1:30:47] when Satan
[1:30:49] he can transform himself
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; and he can change his outward
[1:30:54] appearance.
[1:30:56] [Music]
[1:30:57] But when the scripture says be ye
[1:31:00] transformed,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; that's a different word.
[1:31:07] That word is called metamorph.
[1:31:12] It changes the essence,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; not the outside,
[1:31:18] but the inside.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Satan can only change the outside.
[1:31:24] He can make himself look different.
[1:31:28] He can disguise himself,
[1:31:32] but he does not have the ability
[1:31:35] to change the essence
[1:31:38] of who he is.
[1:31:43] Oh, some young girl comes your way.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; She's anointed to catch the eye of some
[1:31:50] young man
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; or some prescription drug.
[1:31:57] [Music]
[1:32:01] Some situation that looks okay,
[1:32:06] but the essence of it
[1:32:10] to destroy you.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; That Satan,
[1:32:16] but God
[1:32:18] has a power
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; to go past the outside,
[1:32:24] past the disguise.
[1:32:27] I just come to church. Glory.
[1:32:29] Hallelujah.
[1:32:30] And you can wear a disguise.
[1:32:34] God can do a metamorph
[1:32:38] and take the essence
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; and take the wretched sinner
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; and change it.
[1:32:51] [Music]
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll help you out.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom mentioned this a few days
[1:32:58] ago.
[1:33:02] Don't go there. Anybody
[1:33:05] seen a caterpillar?
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Caterpillar.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah, caterpillar.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Little caterpillar
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; and he inches his way along.
[1:33:21] He's just toiling
[1:33:24] slowly.
[1:33:25] He sees a leaf.
[1:33:27] He choose the leaf.
[1:33:29] Choose this leaf.
[1:33:31] He just eats.
[1:33:33] He eats. He crawls
[1:33:36] hoping some bird doesn't eat him.
[1:33:40] He's stuck to the ground.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; We know the caterpillar.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; But something starts to happen.
[1:33:51] And he comes to the point where he's
[1:33:53] eaten. He can eat no more.
[1:34:01] He finds a hidden place
[1:34:04] and he wraps himself up
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; and he
[1:34:11] he hangs there.
[1:34:14] And you know, you and I would look at it
[1:34:16] for a while and said, "Nothing's
[1:34:17] happening."
[1:34:22] But if you watch it
[1:34:25] little by little,
[1:34:28] He starts to change
[1:34:31] that caterpillar is is is adjusting.
[1:34:36] You can look at the sack.
[1:34:39] You say, "Well, nothing's happening."
[1:34:42] But inside
[1:34:45] the essence
[1:34:47] is changing
[1:34:50] something is changing.
[1:34:54] And maybe about eight plus days or so
[1:34:58] The ages go by
[1:35:01] and he starts to move.
[1:35:04] Something's happened to me. And he got
[1:35:07] tired of being locked in.
[1:35:10] And he starts to peel away
[1:35:14] the shell that's been around him
[1:35:17] because something inside of him
[1:35:20] that held him to the earth
[1:35:24] changed. now
[1:35:26] and he don't really start to well wait a
[1:35:28] second.
[1:35:30] What has happened?
[1:35:32] He gets some wings. They start to
[1:35:35] sprout.
[1:35:36] He starts to beat them a little bit and
[1:35:39] you he starts to look at him.
[1:35:42] Where's the old man?
[1:35:45] Where's the caterpillar?
[1:35:48] I can't find anything.
[1:35:50] My legs are different. My arms are
[1:35:52] different. My head is different.
[1:35:56] What are these things?
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; He has been completely
[1:36:01] transformed.
[1:36:04] Completely.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Not just an outside,
[1:36:09] but it is inside.
[1:36:12] That's what this word
[1:36:14] has come to do to you and me.
[1:36:16] We wrap ourselves
[1:36:19] in the word of this hour
[1:36:21] and we just bask in the word.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Age upon age
[1:36:27] through seven church ages.
[1:36:29] The bride is wrapped in the word.
[1:36:33] But in this hour,
[1:36:36] the unveiling of God,
[1:36:39] we are no longer landbased
[1:36:42] creeping along the earth.
[1:36:44] God gave us wings
[1:36:47] to take us up to
[1:36:51] a heavenly realm.
[1:36:53] You are not a caterpillar.
[1:36:56] You have been called
[1:36:59] from an eternal realm
[1:37:01] to you to transform you
[1:37:06] into eternity.
[1:37:08] [Music]
[1:37:10] Amen.
[1:37:14] That's what this message that you heard
[1:37:16] this morning.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; It's calling you
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; to transformation
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; a little while ago.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; I'm closing.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; I was sitting pondering
[1:37:42] And you know, God's thoughts are eternal
[1:37:44] to us.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Would we agree?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; But not everything is eternal.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Not everything's eternal. The devil
[1:37:57] ain't eternal.
[1:38:01] Okay. Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about that.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; So I was thinking, you know, Lord,
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; your thoughts are eternal. You thought
[1:38:07] of us.
[1:38:13] But not everybody
[1:38:15] is eternal beings because not everybody
[1:38:16] has a seed.
[1:38:19] So I was pondering that. So I just
[1:38:21] searched it a little bit
[1:38:24] and the first quote that came up.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Love
[1:38:30] chosen us
[1:38:34] before the foundation of the world."
[1:38:37] I said, "Amen."
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. having predestinated us into the
[1:38:40] adoption of children by Christ.
[1:38:44] You know what brother Brandham said
[1:38:45] next?
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; He says, "What about that, brother
[1:38:48] Mike?"
[1:38:53] What?
[1:38:56] What about that, brother Mike?
[1:39:01] Little brother's talking to me.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; So now I was really reading.
[1:39:08] Isn't that wonderful?
[1:39:10] He loved you. He loved you before there
[1:39:12] was a world.
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:15] He knows your nature. He knows your
[1:39:18] nature. He knows your weaknesses. He
[1:39:21] knows your habits. He knows all about
[1:39:24] you.
[1:39:26] What you was going to be.
[1:39:28] Then he looked over the whole universe
[1:39:34] and said, "I choose you.
[1:39:39] Hallelujah.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; He knows your weakness.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; He knows your failings.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; He knows your mistakes.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; He knows where you trip and fall.
[1:39:49] All of that
[1:39:51] aspect of you.
[1:39:53] He looked over the whole universe
[1:39:56] and he says, "I choose you. I choose
[1:39:59] you. I choose you.
[1:40:03] It has nothing to do
[1:40:05] with your merit.
[1:40:12] He said when he did that
[1:40:15] before there was ever a speck of life,
[1:40:19] then you're eternal with God.
[1:40:23] He says then you become eternal
[1:40:27] because you're part of God.
[1:40:32] Hallelujah.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; That's brother Tom speaking about the
[1:40:36] word becoming personal this morning.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Because when you read this message,
[1:40:43] you realize and you say, "Hey,
[1:40:46] that's me."
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; That's seeing your name in the book.
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; So better tell him to say,
[1:40:57] "Don't over complicate it.
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:14] Amen.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; You know, why don't the musicians come?
[1:41:18] But
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; that's what this message is all about.
[1:41:27] is to bring us back to Eden again,
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; to bring us back to the original.
[1:41:35] [Music]
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; If I could say it is to bring a Samson
[1:41:40] back to full strength,
[1:41:46] poor old Samson has forgotten
[1:41:50] who he was.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; He'd got lost this way, his own idea
[1:41:55] that way.
[1:41:57] Satan had got him bound up
[1:42:01] bound up on this grinder.
[1:42:05] His mind
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; was in need
[1:42:09] of a renewing
[1:42:12] and he must have pushed that mill around
[1:42:16] and his memory. You must have been
[1:42:19] thinking, "Oh, remember that time
[1:42:22] when I took those Philistines down
[1:42:25] and broke the cords, but they were
[1:42:29] I remember
[1:42:31] he starts to remember."
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe around that time.
[1:42:36] His hand went to brush his hair a little
[1:42:37] bit.
[1:42:41] He started to feel something.
[1:42:44] Wait, there there's a lot more hair
[1:42:45] there.
[1:42:47] the covenant
[1:42:49] that he was born under
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; was growing out. And he started to
[1:42:54] recognize
[1:42:57] that he was again.
[1:42:59] He started to remember
[1:43:03] down through these ages.
[1:43:06] The Lord, the church,
[1:43:08] grinding through the ages.
[1:43:11] But in the seventh age,
[1:43:13] when the word opened up,
[1:43:16] My bride
[1:43:18] starts to remember
[1:43:20] who I am.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Samson start to feel the pain.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Right. There was a time when I had a job
[1:43:32] in my life
[1:43:35] and I flew the Philistines.
[1:43:38] That's what we are right now.
[1:43:40] We're realizing
[1:43:44] to this hour.
[1:43:46] to renew our mind
[1:43:49] back to who we are.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:44:00] so many under pressure in the scripture.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:44:05] the poor Hebrew boys under pressure in
[1:44:07] scripture.
[1:44:08] The what? The Hebrew boys.
[1:44:14] Oh, there's too much to talk about. But
[1:44:15] you know what?
[1:44:17] You know, in the pressure.
[1:44:20] The Hebrew boys are in the fire.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine standing in the furnace?
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:29] Heated up seven times.
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:34] Anybody got burned yet lately?
[1:44:41] How does it feel?
[1:44:44] It feels good to be burned.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:50] Who loves burning?
[1:44:52] Nobody.
[1:44:55] Nobody. No. Nobody. You touch the flame.
[1:44:58] It's
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; instant.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; And then you look at it like, "Oh my
[1:45:06] god.
[1:45:08] Then your fingers tender.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; I can't do that because I got burned.
[1:45:16] They were staring at a fire
[1:45:20] time
[1:45:23] heat
[1:45:26] pressure.
[1:45:28] Bow.
[1:45:30] Come on. Bow.
[1:45:33] You're going there.
[1:45:36] The flesh is going to melt.
[1:45:39] Come on, just bow a little bit.
[1:45:42] It's just a little thing. Just
[1:45:45] image.
[1:45:47] Is it really that big of a deal?
[1:45:52] I'll never bow.
[1:45:54] and they exerted pressure on them,
[1:45:57] but they were seed
[1:46:00] and so they could stand the pressure.
[1:46:06] They said, "God's able to deliver us,
[1:46:09] but even so,
[1:46:12] he does it.
[1:46:15] Even so,
[1:46:17] we will not bow. I know I'm going
[1:46:19] through Leodosa.
[1:46:21] I know it's difficult. I know you're
[1:46:24] under pressure. I know you young people
[1:46:26] go through it. The world is trying to
[1:46:30] make you break.
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:34] I will never bow.
[1:46:37] I know my God can deliver me from this
[1:46:38] situation.
[1:46:41] If I have to walk through
[1:46:45] the valley of the shadow of death
[1:46:51] can be all around me,
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; but I will not bow.
[1:46:57] You know what happened?
[1:46:59] They walked.
[1:47:02] The soldiers
[1:47:05] soldier one dies.
[1:47:07] Soldier two.
[1:47:10] Shadrach
[1:47:12] [Applause]
[1:47:18] two
[1:47:19] like you like you standing shoulders
[1:47:22] back
[1:47:24] stand strong Shadrach
[1:47:28] we won't bow to no image
[1:47:33] for one
[1:47:35] the flames didn't touch
[1:47:39] [Music]
[1:47:40] Have you ever been around a fire?
[1:47:44] Yeah.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; And then you come back from the fire.
[1:47:53] I'm a smoke stack.
[1:47:56] You try to wash your hair.
[1:47:59] Hey, who's been around the fire?
[1:48:02] Yeah, me.
[1:48:05] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
[1:48:08] were inside the
[1:48:12] [Applause]
[1:48:13] smell
[1:48:15] like smoke.
[1:48:18] Amen.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; You are in the fire.
[1:48:22] You're in the fire of Leodysia,
[1:48:24] but you're walking with a transformed
[1:48:27] life inside.
[1:48:29] And you don't even smell like this
[1:48:32] world.
[1:48:34] Know what he say? You're so You don't
[1:48:37] even look like the woman.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; You don't have nothing about you.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; You ladies look so pure.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; You don't look like a pure lady.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; I know it's cuz I'm transformed.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; But do you know the best part?
[1:48:55] The best part
[1:48:58] is not that they just withtood pressure.
[1:49:04] the heat
[1:49:06] in the moment of the most difficult hour
[1:49:11] in the worst of the ages,
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; the darkest of hours,
[1:49:20] the son of man himself
[1:49:24] into the fire.
[1:49:27] You're not alone.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; You're not alone.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; You're not walking in the fire alone.
[1:49:33] He's
[1:49:35] waiting for you.
[1:49:37] He's standing in the middle.
[1:49:40] See you can make it
[1:49:43] strengthening you. I'm with you to the
[1:49:45] end to the end of the world. I will
[1:49:49] never forsake you.
[1:49:53] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; That's where you are.
[1:49:57] Being ye not conformed,
[1:49:59] but being ye transformed,
[1:50:04] eternity
[1:50:06] is present with you
[1:50:09] in this hour
[1:50:11] to draw you.
[1:50:15] [Applause]
[1:50:18] Hallelujah. Don't be afraid. Amen. Don't
[1:50:20] be afraid. God bless you.
[1:50:25] We're in the heat together.
[1:50:29] We're in the fire together.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; They had company. They
[1:50:40] were in the fire together.
[1:50:43] This bride is together.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Have no fear.
[1:50:52] with you.
[1:50:54] I will not leave you
[1:50:57] comfortless.

[1:51:06] by the renewing
[1:51:08] of your mind. God bless you. God bless
[1:51:10] you.

[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; This is special.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; So we really thank God.
[1:51:45] [Applause]
[1:51:54] against the need to be transformed.
[1:52:01] They see humanity
[1:52:05] always tends to go the way of least
[1:52:07] resistance.
[1:52:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; The call we have
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; is under go.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; It evolves some level.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We should not go the way of least
[1:52:34] resistance.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; We need to go upward.
[1:52:43] and you're not going upward,
[1:52:45] there is some bit of strength involved.
[1:52:50] So the good fight
[1:52:52] is to fight against the contemporary
[1:52:55] flow.
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:53:00] That where the world goes, we go with
[1:53:04] it.
[1:53:05] How they dress, we dress with them. We
[1:53:09] must keep our eye
[1:53:12] on Christ the north star.
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; You see, you just need to see the steady
[1:53:20] stand
[1:53:24] because the power to transform
[1:53:27] is in the revealed word.
[1:53:31] The word is our energizer.
[1:53:35] We are actually charged by the word to
[1:53:37] go upward.
[1:53:41] You see the way of less resistance
[1:53:46] makes us flow backwards to Jericho.
[1:53:51] But the labor upward
[1:53:54] and the strength to transform
[1:53:57] is that word which goes to your soul.
[1:54:02] Amen. It's the kind of amount of
[1:54:05] pressure
[1:54:08] which will be pressing from the inside
[1:54:13] to resist the weight of the five
[1:54:15] elephants.
[1:54:18] Otherwise, if there is nothing in there,
[1:54:22] it just comes up.
[1:54:26] But as we keep the word, we are keeping
[1:54:29] enough pressure
[1:54:32] because the pressure of this day
[1:54:35] is bow
[1:54:38] or be broken.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; But we tell the devil, we shall not bow
[1:54:44] to you.
[1:54:46] The word in you is the power that drives
[1:54:50] against the pressure
[1:54:53] that the world tries to push against
[1:54:55] you.
[1:54:58] What I loved most is when the brother
[1:55:01] brought conforming to church,
[1:55:07] you know, just a rich younger ruler,
[1:55:12] especially our children raised in the
[1:55:14] message.
[1:55:16] They've been raised with terminologies
[1:55:18] of brother,
[1:55:22] God bless you. They've been developed
[1:55:25] with the culture to pray,
[1:55:29] how to dress
[1:55:31] and to keep their life around church.
[1:55:34] They conform.
[1:55:38] There is a way one can conform.
[1:55:41] But conforming to church atmosphere
[1:55:45] is not the new birth.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; The new birth
[1:55:52] will seal the little holes
[1:55:58] where the water
[1:56:00] down in the ocean
[1:56:03] would try to filter into.
[1:56:07] That's what the Holy Ghost does. He goes
[1:56:11] sealing all those little holes.
[1:56:14] So we are made out of a tree
[1:56:18] that can let the water in.
[1:56:22] Amen. But we thank God for the baptism
[1:56:27] of the Holy Ghost. He keeps looking for
[1:56:29] those little holes,
[1:56:32] those little weaknesses,
[1:56:34] those little failures and seals them
[1:56:38] that while we are in school,
[1:56:41] our places of work in different places,
[1:56:45] we can be able to stand the pressure.
[1:56:51] Amen. So the Holy Ghost wants to seal us
[1:56:56] not till the next revival.
[1:57:00] So when he does the sealing, he seals
[1:57:04] that part permanently.
[1:57:09] Amen. So we need to come and face
[1:57:12] reality
[1:57:15] deep down in our hearts.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, am I conforming?
[1:57:22] All I need to be transformed
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; because you know when the brother was
[1:57:29] talking about the metamorphosis
[1:57:33] when this caterpillar changes
[1:57:38] when it's a caterpillar
[1:57:40] acts a certain way it has a particular
[1:57:44] appetite
[1:57:46] and once it's transformed
[1:57:49] it doesn't have a desire to become a
[1:57:51] caterpillar again.
[1:57:54] Are you together with me? And so when
[1:57:56] it's, you know, covered under the
[1:57:59] cocoon,
[1:58:02] then again it kind of pushes out
[1:58:07] and it becomes something else.
[1:58:10] The mind changes, the appetite changes.
[1:58:14] our desire.
[1:58:16] God be gracious that we may not be
[1:58:20] conformed but that we may be transformed
[1:58:24] to the renewing of our mind.
[1:58:27] And when the mind is changed, then
[1:58:30] everything that comes out of us is
[1:58:33] totally changed. No wonder Paul says,
[1:58:36] "Let this mind be in you that was in
[1:58:40] Christ Jesus." Would you call the mind
[1:58:42] of Christ down?
[1:58:45] Amen. Come down to become my mind that I
[1:58:49] may think like a God that I may not just
[1:58:52] be conformed but that I may be
[1:58:55] transformed.
[1:58:56] I know that you are fighting a battle
[1:58:59] and it was not easy for that young girl,
[1:59:04] amen, to win that battle. She came and
[1:59:07] told brother Brham, I think I'm mentally
[1:59:10] cracked. And brother Brham said, "Yes,
[1:59:13] you are." So what do you need to stay on
[1:59:16] the knees until the change come?
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; To stay on the knees until that change
[1:59:24] comes. Brother Joshua, you can come
[1:59:26] over. Would you say, "Lord, I want to be
[1:59:29] transformed."
[1:59:31] In areas where you're conforming,
[1:59:34] tell that's not enough for me.
[1:59:38] There must come a power
[1:59:41] to fully transform me
[1:59:43] into the image of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:59:47] God bless you, brother. We really
[1:59:50] appreciate you coming our way.
[1:59:53] Brother Tom, it's always the third
[1:59:57] weekend of October.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; It's always the third weekend of October
[2:00:04] and we are looking forward the next
[2:00:06] year.
[2:00:08] Don't you say amen?
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We certainly
[2:00:14] appreciate this is a great vast.
[2:00:18] Amen.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, God bless you
[2:00:22] for being a father to this brother
[2:00:25] Michael.
[2:00:28] No wonder he says he was raised in a
[2:00:30] good family.
[2:00:33] Amen. So pastors, children,
[2:00:36] there is a lot to fight for.
[2:00:40] Don't confirm.
[2:00:42] Brother Michael says it came to the
[2:00:44] reality
[2:00:46] that he personally needed Christ.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; I believe you've been fed.
[2:00:58] I believe you've been fed.
[2:01:03] And you are even
[2:01:06] [Music]
[2:01:06] [Applause]
[2:01:20] do you want to be transformed?
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing and say I
[2:01:25] surrender. I surrender and to the Lord.
[2:01:28] This is the one.
[2:01:30] I
[2:01:32] surrender
[2:01:33] [Music]
[2:01:35] oh
[2:01:38] to you Lord. I
[2:01:42] surrender.
[2:01:46] I surrender to you my blessed savior.
[2:01:51] Oh
[2:01:53] to thee my blessed
[2:01:58] savior.

[2:02:16] Lord I want to be transformed to your
[2:02:18] image. To you I surrender.
[2:02:21] [Music]

[2:02:28] surrender all.

[2:04:16] Precious heavenly father, king of glory.
[2:04:18] Lord, we want to thank you Lord for thy
[2:04:21] word, it never returns void. Heavenly
[2:04:25] father, your word each time it is sent.

[2:04:37] the power to heal. Lord, each time your

[2:04:44] power to break every force of darkness.

[2:04:49] oh heavenly father, it breaks every
[2:04:52] barrier. Oh God, each time your word is

[2:05:42] showing us, oh heavenly father, that
[2:05:44] there is a one greater in us. Greater is

[2:06:33] you are not accepting, oh heavenly
[2:06:35] father, king of glory, that The enemy
[2:06:37] will come Lord and sweep us out. Lord,
[2:06:41] you have put a standard. Oh heavenly
[2:06:43] father, king of glory, amidst the
[2:06:46] pressures. Oh heavenly father, king of
[2:06:48] glory, you are sealing us, oh God, with

[2:06:53] are sealing us, oh heavenly father, king
[2:06:55] of glory. Lord from our mistakes Lord

[2:09:38] have had an understanding. Heavenly
[2:09:40] Father, Lord, we are being brought back

[2:10:05] renewing of our minds, Lord. We
