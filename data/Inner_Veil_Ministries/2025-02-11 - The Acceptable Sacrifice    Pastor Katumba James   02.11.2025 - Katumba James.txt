Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for this afternoon. the grace that you've given up us to come into your presence. You said where two or three are gathered in your name, you will be there in their midst. And we believe Lord, you are here, Lord. Speak to us again. We also pray you may hear our prayers. We appreciate for the service we had in the morning. We pray that again may be with us this afternoon. all other brothers and sisters into your hands to be part of this service. Remember sister was traveling to and even others in different brother going back because of ill health over them heavenly watch over us all together for the grow of your holy name in the name of the Lord Jesus grant us peace Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us go to Romans chapter 12. &gt;&gt; We're reading from verse one verse two. &gt;&gt; Romans 12 verse one verse 2. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. and be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. May God sing of his word. Be seated. So I want to preach on the acceptable sacrifice. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says &gt;&gt; that we offer our bodies as a living sacrifice acceptable to God. And then he says that is our reasonable service. Now a sacrifice like we would look in the Old Testament they used to offer animals. as their sacrifices, you know, and then they had various forms of sacrifices, you know, they had sin offerings, peace offering, Christmas offering. But then all these sacrifices were all a shadow of Christ. You know, they were all pointing us to Christ. Now the Bible says we are living at the time when already Christ has fulfilled all these shadows in the Old Testament. Praise the name of our Lord where they would offer those sacrifices and now it comes to us that we in the Old Testament they were offering those sacrifices of animals. Now in the New Testament, we ourselves, praise the name of our Lord, who have been redeemed of the Lord, we become the sacrifices. And so you must offer yourself as a willful sacrifice. You yourself just like our Lord Jesus Christ. He offered himself as a sacrifice willfully I laid down my life and take it back. And then he said there is no greater love than that a man should lay down his life for his friends. So then Christ now calls upon us and we become the sacrifices and then us being the sacrifices in the Old Testament the animal sacrifices they became dead. Praise the name of Lord. But then here us we offer our sacrifices and we still live. In other words, it is a continuous sacrifice. You you keep on offering to the Lord. When you give your life to the Lord Jesus Christ, you are offering yourself as a living sacrifice. When you do the things that God requires from you, you offering yourself as a living sacrifice. When you take time in prayers, you are offering yourself as a living sacrifice. When you give out what you have, you are offering sacrifice. When you do services of the Lord, you're offering sacrifice. So you find that Christian life is a life of sacrificing. It's a life of selfdenial. Praise the name of our Lord. You know you deny your rights. You deny your your liberties. Everything you are considering to do things of the Lord. What should I do for the Lord from morning to evening? You are seeking how you can please the Lord. You know what the Bible says that he that marries seeks to please the other. And then even now in our salvation we accept the Lord Jesus as our personal as our savior. We need to seek to please him. We need to seek that we are we do things that are acceptable and you should always reserve that kind of mind. What I'm doing is it pleasing to the Lord. What I'm thinking is it pleasing to the Lord? Praise the name of our Lord. You know there are people who are offering sacrifices and to them they thought that you know maybe doing the work you know that would be good enough. We can see one example here. Cain. The Bible says in Genesis 4, Genesis chapter 4 and then we can read from verse three. The scripture says, &gt;&gt; "And in the process of time, it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord, and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering. But unto Cain, unto his offering, he had no respect. And Cain was very, and his countenance fell. brought an offering to God and you know he brought fruits and made the altar beautiful. You know his was the physical attraction, the physical kind of appearance and then the Bible says God was not acceptable accepting Cain and even his offering rejected them. Praise the name of Allah. But now when Abel brought his firsting of the flock The Bible says that God had respect unto Abel and his offering. So it matters also the kind of person who is offering to God. Praise the name of our Lord. Cain was rejected. Even his offering was rejected. Now the Bible says, "Praise the name of our Lord. In the in the book of Proverbs 15:8, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is his delight. The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord, but he loveth him that follows after righteousness. Praise the name of our Lord. So if you follow righteousness then the Bible says he loves that person who follows righteousness. And so when you pray praise the name of our Lord. The Lord loves that. He says he delights in the prayer of the upright. When the wicked person praying or offering a sacrifice, it's an abomination. Praise the name of the Lord. It's an abomination. You know, you can even remember in the times of Elisha when the king of Israel came to Elisha and he went there actually, you know, with Jehoshaphat, &gt;&gt; the king of Judah, the prophet said, if it was not for the righteous Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't have even talked to you or looked back to you. You see that the presence of the king of Israel, the son of Ahab traveled the prophet until the prophet said, "You get me somebody to get me back into the spirit." It was an abomination. And so now you can now look at these things. How about you having communion with the wicked people? They are your close friends. They are the people give you advice. They are your counselors. How much more you know will it trouble your prayer before God? When you spend time with things that are contrary to the word, watching things that are not right, hearing things that are not right, you know, speaking things that are not right, it affects your sacrifice when you come to offer it before the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. So the prophet said, it was not this man who is right here and hear what you want to say. was telling him, "Go back to the gods of your father. Go back to the gods of your mother." So now the Bible has told us that the sacrifices of the wicked are abominations to the Lord like a Bible says he was rejected. Even his sacrifice was rejected. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in Proverbs 28:9 28:9, the Bible says, "He that turneth away ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination." Now he says, "If you turn your hair, from hearing the law. In other words, if you refuse to obey the word of God, then God would ask, "Why do you want me to hear you? You don't want to hear what I'm saying." You know, it's just the same thing in communication. Somebody talks to you, you don't pay attention. But now for you, when you you are talking, you want the person to pay attention. So that's what the Lord is saying. You don't hear what I'm telling. But then why do you want me to hear what you praise the name of our Lord? So he says if you don't hear the word of God, if you don't obey the law of the Lord, then your prayer is an abomination. Praise the name of our Lord because communion is a two-way He says come and let us reason together. And then on your side you have rejecting receiving from you want him to hear you say no it's under combination and that was the condition of Cain when the Lord told Cain if you do right you will be acceptable didn't want that he rejected the council of God he went ahead and killed Abel and so we need to see that we are careful in our Christian walk the name of our lord that you don't become a rebarious person you know a rebarious person however many times you tell him about something he does the contrary the contrary he justifies what he's doing but you see the Lord wants us to be obedient children. So if you hear the word of God and then you pray to God, in other words, if you open your ears to God, then you'll also open his ears to your prayer, you become acceptable before him. But if you reject his word, he also reject your word. Praise the name of our Lord. You pray and he says ah your prayer is an abomination I'm not hearing what you are saying praise the name of our Lord. So now the Bible has told us that if we are upright then God will delight in our prayers. Praise the name of Lord. So now let us get back to Genesis chapter 4. Praise the name of our Lord. So the Bible says in verse five, but unto Cain and his offering, they had no respect. In other words, they were not accepted. K was not acceptable to God. Even what he did was not acceptable to God. God was telling Kane, "Get back and do what is right. Praise the name of the Lord. In verse seven, &gt;&gt; if you do well, shall you not be accepted? Praise the name of Lord. So God would desire us to do that which is right, that which is pleasing to him, then we can have, we can be an acceptable sacrifice. If you do not wear sin lies at the door and those shall be his desire. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to be an acceptable sacrifice unto God. You know the Bible talks about in Matthew chapter 7, the people who came to worship or they were serving in the ministry and indeed they had results in the ministry. Map 7:21. Not everyone that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that does the will of my father which is in heaven. Verse 7, verse 21. So these people knew how to worship the true God, but yet they were doing everything they would do outside of the will of God. But the Bible has told us in Romans chapter 12 and verse 2 that we need to have our mind renewed and prove what is good and acceptable and perfect the will of God. And then these people here in Matthew chapter 7, they were busy doing what was service to the Lord, but it was not in the will of God, they were not acceptable, praise the name of our Lord. So in Mark 7:22, many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have you not prophesied in your name? They prophesied. In other words, there was a manifestation of the Holy Spirit. Maybe they prophesied something and came to pass and then others they cast out demons and then people were delivered and then they did many wonderful works in the name of the Lord and you know they were standing before the Lord and said Lord I was part of your ministry. I was part of your kingdom here on earth. Everybody knew me. As a prophet, I prophesy and things come to pass. Everybody knew me as a person who is casting out demons. People were delivered. People were relieved. Did many wonderful works in your name. I said, Lord, I've come that the door may be open to me. And they say, and I will profess to them, I never knew you. Depart from me. You that work iniquity. They were rejected worshippers. They were rejected the way they rejected those of bad. But these ones were worshiping the true God. said, "I don't know you. Go away from me." Much as they had the spiritual manifestations of the God, themselves were rejected. They were not acceptable before him and we shouldn't try to live to be that kind of a person whereby you know what influences you is the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. But yet your life is not in the of God. That is the greatest embarrassment that will be. And that's what brother Brham says. That will be the greatest disappointment. A man in a banner will not be disappointed that day. Knows that he'll end up in hell. A man doing funny things will not be disappointed. But then those who are coming to church professing to be Christians and then the Lord says you are just a joker, you are fake. That's how bad it will be. And that's how he was telling them much as you did this but I don't know you. Praise the name of God. You know when you see Abraham, Abraham had many sons. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. But the Bible says, the other sons of the concubine. He gave them gifts and sent them away. Praise the name of our Lord. It was only Isaac, the son of the free woman, who received whatever Abraham. Praise the name of Allah. So, we don't look for gifts. Oh, I've spoken in tongues. I've prophesied. I've done this miracle. All those things of God. But that's not what brings us to church. Praise the name of God. We don't come for prosperity gospel. We don't come for natural benefit but what brings us here is the life of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. That should be our essence. The main thing we are looking at. Let his life be formed in you. When his life is in me, he can't reject himself. The Bible says Jesus cannot deny himself. So if his life is in you, the Holy Spirit is in you, he can't say I don't know you because you are part of him. You come from him. Praise the name of our Lord. But the sons of the conscripts go away. Praise the name of our Lord. And this what we see in most of the denomination. They want manifestation of this of this. But they reject the word which is Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. But to us the word is precious because the bride has to become the word of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Just as the word put on flesh in Christ. So even now the word of God is putting flesh on the bride. The bride is becoming the manifestation of the word of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Ephesians chapter 5 and then we start reading from verse one. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says be therefore followers of God as dear children. and walk in love as Christ also has loved us and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor. Praise the name of our Lord. So the Bible is telling us Christ gave himself as an offering and a sacrifice unto God. So then he's telling us also let us also as Christ did he loved us &gt;&gt; and he gave himself for us. So we also need to give ourselves over to God and then walk in the love of God. You walk in the word of God, in the obedience of God, saying that you are acceptable to God. God has accepted you as a sacrifice. The way the Bible says, the delight of God is the prayer of the righteous people. So when the righteous prays, God wants to hear what you are teaching. Praise the name of our Lord. So even all our services to the Lord, when you come to serve the Lord, you serve it to the Lord. Whatever you do, you do it with all your heart, doing unto men, maybe not doing it unto your boss, but you're doing everything in the name of the Lord. At the end of the day, the Lord may receive that glory. Praise the name of our Lord. So God would desire us to offer willingly with a perfect heart, not doubleminded. Let me try this or maybe it's an obligation. If I don't do it, they will say this and this. That's not with a pure heart. But you know, whatever you do, Lord, I'm doing this in the name of God. Praise the name of God. You are giving yourself, you know, offering a sacrifice, pure from your heart with all your mind into it. Praise the name of our Lord. In Exodus 20 25:1, the Bible says, "And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, speak unto the children of Israel, that they may bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart shall take my offering. Praise the name of our God. He said, "Offer willingly with your heart, perfect sacrifice, acceptable sacrifice. something you're doing from your heart. You're not being compelled. You know, you're not being forced. You know, you're not doing it because of advantage, but you are doing it in the name of the Lord. Say, Lord, I know this is my obligation. Praise the name of the Lord. The life that we live should be a sacrifice unto them. Sweet smelling savor see your life then he's pleased. My blood is not shed on the cross for nothing. My blood has changed this one. My blood has transformed this one. Your conduct has been changed. Your speech has been changed. Your walk has been changed. A sweet smelling savor. Praise the name of acceptable unto God. So our sacrifices the life that we live holy living is a hol is a sacrifice and the Lord wants it you know holy. Praise the name of our lord. In the scriptures here in 1 Peter 2:5, the Bible says, "Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Praise the name of the Lord. So your life is a sacrifice before a life that is acceptable like the high priest. He had to walk acceptably before God. Whenever you go into the holies of holies bells around him and then there was a rope tied to that. So there's a walk that God expected him to walk and there's also a walk that God expects us to walk to walk in places that are not right to do things that are not right. To think about things that are not right to see things that are not right. to hear things that are not right. He wants us to have an acceptable walk as a liveless storm. The Holy Spirit in you guides you into all truth to do things that the Lord will desire to do. As lively stones, built up a spiritual house. So then we are a holy priesthood and a priest offers sacrifices. Praise the name of this is the desire of God that we can be acceptable sacrifices. As a priest, a holy priesthood, then you are meant to offer spiritual sacrifice, giving your life over to the Lord, over the things of the kingdom that the Lord delights in. Praise the name of our Lord. You know the way the Lord would say, I delight when he's praying. I want to hear him when he's praying. that were taught about Job, praise the name of our Lord, you know Job then God telling Job's friends that you know I will not hear you but you go to Job so they went with their sacrifice to Job and now when Job prayed to God then God accepted this praise the name of our Lord and we know Christ is accepted for us. If we can also live the life of Jesus Christ, we are also accepted for others. You can intercede for another person. You can pray overration and frustration changes. Praise the name of our like Jehoshaphat. It was acceptable because of the other king was worshiping idol. And then the prophet saying, "If it was not Jehoshaphat, praise the name of the Lord, I would have not looked to you." But yet when the prophet went into the spirit of God was able to get a solution for Israel. Praise the name of our Lord, standing for one another. That's why it is always very important for us that we live life that are acceptable as sacrifices. Then you can be a solution to your home. You can be a solution to your place of work. You can be a solution troubles that afflict others. You can stand up in prayer where the Lord can reveal to you and tell you go and do this and this. Praise the name of Lord like Abraham standing in for Lord. And the Bible say when God remembered Abraham, he had mercy on Lord. Let us go to Genesis chapter 19. Praise the name of our Lord. Abraham was an acceptable sacrifice that he would intercede for Lot until God spared Sodom. Spared Lot. Praise the name of our Lord because of Abraham. Praise the name of our Lord. Genesis chapter 19 and then verse 29. And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt. Praise the name of our Lord. You can look at backsliding lot in his cities which are immoral. The prayers of Abraham this side. God accepted it. God had respect upon the prayer of Abraham and he was able to deliver a lot and we may have many lots in our many lots in our family. There are people who are no longer coming to church. He's having this excuse having this reason to some extent like a lot. You can now also stand for that brotherhood. Lord bring back my brother. Lord bring back my sister. Praise the name of like today we have a we have the Lord's supper but you may find some people are not around in the afternoon service because they have a condition like Lord. So you intercede for such a person. Lord, I pray for brothers and aunts. I pray for sisters and aunts that the Lord may deliver them out of the circumstance that is holding them. Praise the name of our Lord. And you know when God gives you grace, you need to stand for another person just as Christ stood for us. Praise the name of our Lord. You say, "Lord, I pray for my brother for my sister. There &gt;&gt; is a condition that's taking them away from fellowship. There's a condition that's pulling them back. Praise the name of our Lord. So you don't just become an acceptable sacrifice for your own self but also for others. Praise the name of our Lord. Brother Brandham says eternal life is living for others. Praise the name of our Lord. You remember those in prayer. I used to come with brother and so in church but he no longer come. So you stand in the gap. Praise the name of our Lord. I used to come with sister so and so but she no longer come. You intercede for her. You intercede for him. You take forward and encourage them. Why don't you come and we fellowship together? reaching out where they are, giving them a call. Praise the name of our Lord. Of course, you don't call them to accuse them. Express the love of God to you. Praise the name of our Lord. The Lord loves you. The Lord delights in you. That's why he's still keeping you. The Lord delighted in Lord. That's why he sent the angels there by a span deliverance. You can imagine the condition of Lord that he kept on lingering in sodom. They telling him we are going to destroy this city. But then maybe was looking where is my bank account? Where is this person? I demand money, why is this one here? Until the angels just caught their hands. and pull them out of the desert. Praise the name of Lord. We need to stand for one another. You don't only pray for yourself. You don't only pray for your family when you are praying. So Lord help us. There is this Lord we have this need. Lord we have this condition. So then you reach out. Praise the name of our Lord. You are offering yourself as a living sacrifice. Your prayers are a sacrifice. Praise the name of our Lord. Your service to the Lord is a sacrifice. Praise the name of our Lord. So you are reaching out to help somebody even when somebody is in need. You know even that we are talking about the spiritual need of God but there also physical need where you can also sacrifice. Praise the name of God for a physical need like the scripture pastor was talking about this morning. Elijah and the widow woman. The widow woman offered a sacrifice to help the prophet. Brother Brandham teaches about Elijah and the meal offering. It's the woman who had the meal offering. She offered it. Praise the name of our Lord and it helped the prophet but in turn also helped her. The Bible say if you have a lot or if you have two you know you have two shirts or two things another person is naked you offer it to that person. Your giving is also a sacrifice. Praise the name of our Lord. Like when we have needs around, you identify this is the need. Then you offer the sacrifice. I'm going to do this and this. I'm going to do this and this. There's this need that is lacking. I'm going to take up this position. Praise the name of our Lord because the need that is there. So you are offering a sacrifice. You are giving your time. You are giving your resources. Praise the name of our Lord. And the Lord blesses you for that. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Philippians 4:13. He says, "I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. Philippians 4:13. Notwithstanding, you have done, you have well done that you did communicate with my affliction. beginning of the gospel. When I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. So now they were helping the saints. They knew there was a need somewhere and they had something and that should be of concern even to us. You know maybe a brother they don't have any food. There's a family in distress. Maybe they are sick or they are in any condition. Can you go and give them support? Like now the Bible says in Mark chapter 25, I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you visited me. I was hungry and you fed me. Then you can ask Lord where do we find me? So you can find that the children of God can be caught up in those kind of conditions. A condition of a particular need, a condition of a particular distress. So you need to go there and then supply the need. Give the support that is required in that. So you are offering up a sacrifice. Praise the name of our Lord. And the Bible says we should not be weary in welloing. Praise the name of our Lord. Be there be doing well all the time. &gt;&gt; What you can do to get with joy, praise the name of God. Like when you get our sister Anna Ok in the hospital, if she hears about anybody there, she's always there to get the right physician to see that she can get a support which she can do because that's the ability the Lord has given her. Or if you're in a position of influence, praise the name of our Lord, maybe you can influence giving of jobs. Then you know surely the believers in our church brother can do this one sister can do this work. You move out and ask them can you do this? Can you do this? There's an opportunity here. Praise the name of our Lord. So you are trying to see that you help your household. Praise the name of our Lord. Somebody's lacking this. But I have this Praise the name of our Lord. Then you move out and give that blessed be the name of our Lord. That's why we need to live as a body. You know that there is no lack anywhere. There is a need for this person. What can I do to help him? Praise the name of our Lord. So now the churches here in Philippians &gt;&gt; and Macedonia they were busy supplying from the resources they had for the need of the saints were in Jerusalem because they were not in good shape. Praise the name of our Lord. And I can tell you the need of the ministry is so enormous. Praise the name of our Lord. So much enormous. So you need to take interest different situations in different areas. Take interest. Lord, what can I be involved in? Praise the name of our Lord. You know sometimes I ask myself if the rapture comes today and I have a lot of money on account. &gt;&gt; So what will happen? Praise the name of I have bked a lot of money on the account. But with a lot of money I have there other spiritual needs. So I turn a blind eye. God give them grace to go through that situation. But what I can do to help you stop a lot of things. I will not go with them in the rapture. You just leave them here. But why wouldn't I get what I have and put into the kingdom of God? Praise the name of God. You know the devil is a liar. &gt;&gt; Praise the name over Lord. After all the rapture is soon taking place. &gt;&gt; But then why are you talking that why wouldn't you help the one soul to come into the king? Praise the name of our Lord. But you see Satan is a liar. He can divert your attention on this. Divert your attention on this. And then you find yourself that you are not doing anything for the kingdom of God. Praise the name of our Lord. But we need to see that we are involved in the work of the kingdom. Be involved in the affairs of the church, supporting them, your resources, your time, your prayer, doing everything you can, participating in the church programs, coming in time. We have the Sunday school starting at 10, but then you find you've come when the Sunday school is over. you know be involved in the things of the king that you are part of the move of the Lord in praise the name of our Lord. So we need to see that we offer an acceptable sacrifice to God and you know God accepts a sacrifice which costs you something. Not that those ones are there just for nothing. You know there are some people they say okay if it is to come to church I'll come when I have done everything I was able to do &gt;&gt; that's not a sacrifice now &gt;&gt; but a sacrifice should cost you something so you don't say Wednesday service I'll come when the clients are not coming so you've opened your shop. You've been there from morning when it is 4:30 when they start coming. I think this the time God wanted me to work then you say let me wait 5:30 they are still coming. God has blessed me with a good day. God is here wanting to speak to you. You saying you are saying that God is blessing me. &gt;&gt; God wants a sacrifice which will cost you something. You know 5 4:30 I have to be packing going to the church. that sacrifice praise the name of our lord not because there is no business sometimes &gt;&gt; you at home you even don't have transport today I don't have transport &gt;&gt; so church will not see me &gt;&gt; and you here invort &gt;&gt; it's not costing you anything you sacrifice. Supposing it was your place of work. Would you tell your boss, I didn't have transport, you lose the job, but then when it comes to God, God, you know what I'm going through? You know, I slept hungry last night. Praise the name of God. We have to have a sacrifice that costs us something. Like here in the book of 2 Samuel chapter 24 and then verse 18, the Bible says, "And God came that day to David and said unto him, go up rare and altar unto the Lord in the ththing floor of Aria the Jebusite." Now there were many people who are dying in Israel and now the intervention was needed for that plague to be stayed. The Bible says in verse 15, "So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from Dan even to Basha 7,000 men. Praise the name of the Lord. There was a crisis and then God revealed to David that got to this place and then you offer there a sacrifice. So now when David goes to Arana then he gets him He says, "I've come to offer sacrifice to the Lord." And then the man told him, "No, king." You use it, you don't pay. David said in verse 24, and the king said unto Aruna, &gt;&gt; n, "But I will surely bite of thee at a price, neither will I offer burnt offerings unto my Lord of that which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for 50 shekels of silver. Praise the name of our Lord. Our sacrifices should cost us something. They cost your time, &gt;&gt; your money, &gt;&gt; even your strength. You are investing yourself into it. You're not saying, "I'm going to wait on the Lord when I'm on leave." You know, when things are not busy, I'm going to wait on the Lord when I'm in a holiday. The best time to offer the sacrifice is now. Praise the name of our Lord. A living sacrifice acceptable unto the Lord. And David said, I will not offer to God what costs me nothing. When I'm giving to God like in those days it was animals. He said, you don't give one which is sick because you don't like it. Are you no &gt;&gt; the lame one because it doesn't cost you anything. No, &gt;&gt; you give the best. Say, Lord, I'm giving you this. Praise the name of our giving the best to the Lord. You give the best of your time to the Lord. You don't remember to pray when you are very tired. You are sleepy until when you go to pray you are just dozing. You wake up and remember that you are praying. Pray when you are very attentive, when there are no interruption, read the Bible, read the message book when you are fully awake. Morning hours are the best time because you are fresh. So you wake up early, you pray, you read, you hear. What a good day to start a day. Praise the name of our Lord. You start waiting on the Lord upon the Lord, praying to the Lord, reading his word. Your mind is composed. And many people make decisions in the morning, then they kind of review in the night. Praise the name of the Lord. You're making decisions for your day. You are putting it before the Lord. Lord, as I start out my day, you commit so and so. You pray about it. I'm going to this kind of activity. You pray about it. You commit everything one by one before the Lord. Praise the name of God. We need to offer ourselves as living sacrifices. Acceptable sacrifices. Your prayer is a sacrifice. Your giving is a sacrifice. Holy living is a sacrifice. Serving the Lord is a sacrifice. And that's how the Lord wants us to live life in our life's journey. Let us be living acceptable sacrifices. When you are serving the Lord, don't do it for many pleasing or to do it because it is your obligation to do it in the name of the Lord. doing this in your name, we bring glory and honor to you. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to be acceptable sacrifice in everything we do before the Lord that the Lord can be pleased by what we are doing. Praise the name of Lord. May God bless you. Amen. [applause] Amen. Let us sing this song down at the cross as the song leader comes. Praise the name of the Lord. Down at the cross where my s down from cleansing from sin I cry. There to my heart was the blood of Hallelujah. [music and singing] Glory to his name. Glory to his holy name. Oh, gloryy [singing] to his name. Oh, there to my eyes was the blood of Oh, glory to me.

As we just prepare to speak to the Lord, we sing and say, "Create in me a clean heart." like David this evening can say, "Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart, oh Lord, and renew a right spirit within me. Oh, create in me, [music] create in [singing] me a clean heart.

This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." And after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sapped, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord his death till he come. Amen. Let us pray again. Father in the name of Jesus Christ, dedicate this unleavened bread into your hands, you meet, Father, the purpose which has been made. Bless every one of us.

Grant your grace to all your children to rejoice heavenly father for being obedient to your word. We love you and we bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.
