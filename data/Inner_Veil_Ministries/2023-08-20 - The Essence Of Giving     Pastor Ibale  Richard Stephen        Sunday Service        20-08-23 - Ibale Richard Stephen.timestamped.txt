[19:36] amen amen I just don't know where to
[19:40] begin from
[19:42] but I trust that the Lord will help us
[19:48] to do the best we can
[19:55] this morning as I was waking up and she
[19:58] already went back the Holy Spirit spoke
[20:01] to my heart
[20:03] about Divine Fellowship
[20:07] amen just not Fellowship
[20:11] coming together like we do
[20:14] a Divine Palace
[20:18] so by grace
[20:21] that will be our next area of coverage
[20:27] amen amen so this coming weekend is
[20:35] going to be wedded here
[20:39] so we just pray for them
[20:42] that the Lord may be gracious and bless
[20:45] them
[20:47] and so they stand there after
[20:50] we shallah brother
[20:53] Robert kabasi ministering without an
[20:57] organizer amen amen and he is going to
[21:02] do the wedding also
[21:05] amen amen so let's just stand up and get
[21:09] into the scripture reading
[21:11] we shall turn to the Book of John
[21:14] chapter 3 verse 16.
[21:20] amen amen
[21:24] for God so loved the world
[21:29] that he gave his only begotten son
[21:36] believeth in him
[21:39] should not perish I remember but have
[21:43] everlasting life
[21:47] let's pray one more time
[21:51] father Baba that seems to be the most
[21:56] precious scripture
[22:00] father that when you loved us into what
[22:04] we end up you gave us your only begotten
[22:07] son
[22:09] we thank you for that giving
[22:13] and I pray that you may open up our
[22:15] hearts
[22:17] as we feed from that central point of
[22:21] scripture
[22:23] bless the hearts
[22:25] [Music]
[22:27] build them in a special way
[22:31] in Jesus name
[22:33] amen amen amenated
[22:38] so for a title
[22:42] this morning
[22:45] I want to speak on the essence of giving
[22:49] um
[23:22] the wealth of value of
[23:28] one transferring
[23:31] amen ownership
[23:35] so you take this
[23:38] which is yours and you transfer it
[23:44] in ownership
[23:46] that it has left you and it has gone to
[23:51] the ownership of Another Universe
[23:56] therefore the essence of giving would
[23:59] mean
[24:02] what you in giving a man
[24:06] amen amen
[24:10] which in itself is a particular Grace
[24:16] amen amen without that particular Grace
[24:22] nobody can be able to give us
[24:26] so in second Corinthians chapter 8
[24:41] [Music]
[24:47] on the churches of Macedonia
[24:52] now the church is
[24:58] under the saving grace of God
[25:02] but then Paul is talking about another
[25:06] Grace given unto them
[25:10] another definition of Grace was bestowed
[25:14] unto them
[25:18] so how that in a great trial of
[25:22] afflictions
[25:31] and their deep poverty abounded unto the
[25:34] riches of their liberality
[25:41] amen support singles out the church
[25:48] that was in great try of Affliction
[25:55] [Music]
[25:58] and yet it was moved together
[26:03] then Paul calls it a special
[26:06] manifestation of the grace
[26:11] a special section of Grace
[26:16] a special manifestation of Grace
[26:23] that the grace that saves us
[26:27] pushes out different manifestations of
[26:30] stream
[26:35] [Applause]
[26:57] so in second Corinthians
[27:02] chapter 8 verse
[27:06] he says therefore as he abound in
[27:09] everything
[27:18] I mean all diligence also
[27:26] [Music]
[28:13] but he says let this grace abound also
[28:19] so I speak not by Commandments
[28:24] but by occasion of the foreign
[28:30] Randy and to prove the sincerity of your
[28:35] life
[28:36] amen to prove the sincerity of your life
[28:43] is
[28:44] telling the Corinthians
[28:47] but giving is the special Grace
[28:55] we want to look
[28:58] under that Grace and to touch the
[29:02] essence of giving together
[29:07] we are taking on a nature of the father
[29:12] because it's Grace that gifts
[29:16] that's why brother I mean
[29:20] in verse
[29:23] I speak not by Commandments
[29:27] but by occasions of forwardness
[29:32] to prove the sincerity of Your Love okay
[29:37] always
[29:59] is something that goes a lot further
[30:02] than monetary offerings
[30:11] amen so I'm not really speaking about
[30:15] giving out money in church
[30:19] giving out your ties and everything
[30:24] but the answers touching the nature of
[30:28] the father
[30:31] amen because the love of the father
[30:35] it gives and this is what I'm trying to
[30:39] bring forth this morning
[30:43] that as long as you've got the nature of
[30:46] the father
[30:49] you'll have the ability to gain
[30:52] and this giving here is not limited to
[30:57] the money you are able to give
[31:00] so I want you to understand
[31:03] that's why I'm calling you to the
[31:06] essence of giving it
[31:11] so I'm speaking deeper than the ability
[31:14] to give what you give another brother
[31:20] but I'm speaking about the nature
[31:25] that lays behind the acts
[31:30] amen Amina yes in
[31:36] verse 26
[31:38] foreign
[32:02] [Music]
[32:37] [Music]
[32:39] can be
[32:42] able to
[32:43] be noticed or Survivor be seen in
[32:48] another form she is
[32:53] [Music]
[32:55] man his image
[32:58] and likeness
[33:01] so that man can share in the spiritual
[33:06] quality of God
[33:12] you know God transferred part of what he
[33:16] was to adaptation
[33:20] are you together with me that is giving
[33:25] yeah it includes you know we give the
[33:30] authority and nurture
[33:33] that Adam I want you to share in what I
[33:39] amen Amina So Adam came forth
[33:44] under the glory of God
[33:47] and also dwote in the same Dimension
[33:50] with God
[34:00] [Music]
[34:07] amen so that he can exercise
[34:10] Dominion by that nature
[34:16] amen Amina in the adoption message
[34:20] brother Branham says
[34:25] he said I am Jehovah
[34:28] what did it mean
[34:31] I am the all existence
[34:34] [Music]
[34:35] who has created something off of myself
[34:41] to be a son of man
[34:44] um
[34:53] Jehovah means that God gave man to be a
[34:58] number to God
[35:02] because his father God
[35:05] and he made man and not much
[35:10] so is itself existence anymore
[35:15] he exists with his family
[35:23] amen now she is Jehovah
[35:27] meaning the one who exists with his
[35:31] family
[35:32] [Music]
[35:34] he gave a part of himself away
[35:41] therefore show us in the quality of God
[35:46] are you together with me he makes him to
[35:50] be an amateur God
[35:52] that's what God intended when he created
[36:19] I am
[36:21] all existence ones
[36:24] who has created something yet into off
[36:28] of my myself
[36:36] so this paper here is
[36:39] all that God is
[36:42] but he says I've taken something off of
[36:47] myself
[36:51] amen I've taken off something off of
[36:54] myself
[36:57] so that out of the Peace of myself
[37:07] I have given him my likeness
[37:11] I have given him my image
[37:14] Finance
[37:20] amen the essence of giving
[37:25] praise the Lord
[37:27] so that's the essence
[37:30] [Music]
[37:54] [Music]
[38:29] you know and animals that he was
[38:31] supposed to have dominion
[38:33] foreign
[38:47] [Music]
[39:31] [Applause]
[39:33] governor
[40:35] you cannot be able to give
[40:40] amen Amina so Romans chapter 12.
[40:44] I want you to see this depth here
[40:49] and verse 6.
[40:51] he says having 10 gifts
[40:56] according to the grace that's given to
[40:59] us
[41:03] let us prophesy according to the
[41:06] proportion of faith is
[41:12] amen Amina
[41:14] because you are under grace
[41:18] you can receive from the father or yes
[41:23] multiple gifts
[41:25] and consider that a transferring of
[41:29] ownership
[41:34] are you together with the man what is it
[41:37] God transferring from what he is
[41:43] because in God is healing
[41:52] and God is the pastorship
[41:57] is the Evangelist
[42:00] amen Amina yes those are his gifts
[42:06] they are different Natures of God
[42:10] but God says
[42:12] I am going to give you
[42:16] and when you receive
[42:19] use what I've given you
[42:23] in the proportion of faith
[42:28] foreign
[43:04] [Music]
[43:10] are you together with them those are all
[43:13] Goods
[43:15] elements of God
[43:17] and then he gives them out to you
[43:22] so that you are now
[43:26] required to use the gifts of God of nice
[43:30] work because
[43:35] and then he says he that gives us
[43:40] let him do it with the simplistic
[43:44] because genuine giving away
[43:49] is generated by love
[43:51] [Applause]
[43:53] are you together with me you cannot give
[43:57] with an attitude I'm giving to you
[44:00] because you are poor
[44:05] that one is not giving
[44:09] I'm giving you liquor because you cannot
[44:12] manage to do your wedding
[44:17] that's not God
[44:19] and you use very big words
[44:24] to describe
[44:34] that's not giving
[44:37] let him that give us
[44:39] do it with the simplest
[44:44] are you together with me what is it so
[44:47] in that you know he says after that in
[44:50] verse 9.
[44:53] let love be without the simulation
[45:01] are you together with me now you see
[45:04] he's talking about giving gifts
[45:08] but they are administered
[45:17] so in the first giving when God made a
[45:20] man a substance
[45:27] it's love that proceeded to create men
[45:32] amen Amina he just said let us
[45:37] and once God moves
[45:40] is the movement of love
[45:44] I'll take a part of myself
[45:49] amen and transfer ownership
[45:52] to another form
[45:55] amen that would be a lower means
[46:00] praise God so and when man fell
[46:05] still love it
[46:07] [Music]
[46:09] to go and save man
[46:13] so giving best colors
[46:45] he says but God commandeth his love
[46:50] toward Sacrament
[46:57] Christ died for us
[47:00] so when God is
[47:03] love goes ahead
[47:08] are you together with me when is it even
[47:11] when you are giving
[47:12] you should do let love proceed
[47:18] and once love proceeds that is
[47:27] love stands at the center of giving
[47:32] he packaged his own life
[47:35] I mean he packaged his own life yes
[47:43] to the Fallen
[47:47] [Applause]
[47:51] world's wrapped gifts
[47:56] amen amen in swaddling clothes
[47:59] and God gave his son
[48:03] as a gift to the world
[48:07] Amen Amina in giving we don't look at
[48:11] what we are giving
[48:13] but we look at the principle in giving
[48:19] because
[48:21] is love stepping foreign
[48:53] [Music]
[49:03] stepped down today
[49:09] are you together with me what is it amen
[49:13] Amina so he comes down
[49:15] I want to show you here in Leviticus
[49:18] chapter 17.
[49:21] because the Bible says give his own son
[49:26] to be a preposition
[49:34] some of the same in there
[49:37] Amen to be a propagation
[49:40] [Music]
[49:42] he gave because there was a need
[49:46] are you together with me
[49:49] if you are in love
[49:51] and you see a need
[49:54] love proceeds you
[50:01] you don't reduce a brother to becoming a
[50:04] beggar to offers everything
[50:08] you see there is
[50:13] you don't wait for him to ask for a
[50:16] shirt
[50:21] when God suddenly God
[50:28] this is what God wants to work with us
[50:32] even in giving in our in church
[50:36] giving among our souls
[50:39] we give because we have got a love
[50:42] together
[50:44] which proceeds to meet the need
[50:47] to go
[50:50] amen Amina when you saw the need of
[50:54] redemption
[50:57] could not proceed I mean I could not
[51:01] withhold his own side quality
[51:05] for God so loved the world
[51:09] [Music]
[51:10] [Applause]
[51:12] and when he gave he gets the Sun
[51:15] but the son I don't mind let's go to
[51:18] Leviticus 17 11.
[51:21] this scripture here
[51:27] it is a new testament application
[51:37] [Music]
[51:52] he has given us the lives
[51:57] foreign
[52:00] [Music]
[52:10] [Music]
[52:16] [Applause]
[52:24] [Music]
[52:43] [Music]
[52:58] 13.
[53:04] [Music]
[53:07] [Applause]
[53:17] that is God giving children
[53:24] are you together with me it was love
[53:27] foreign
[53:40] [Music]
[54:12] is referred to as the gifts
[54:20] it is
[54:33] [Music]
[54:41] in the body of the church
[54:47] when he's speaking about that
[54:50] he says ye shall receive according to me
[54:55] therefore now the gift of the Holy Ghost
[54:58] how can you receive unless there is a
[55:02] giving
[55:05] Allah
[55:48] foreign
[55:57] [Music]
[57:07] could that choose the body
[57:10] from the judgments of sins
[57:14] how much more when God gives the gifts
[57:19] of his own life
[57:24] hallelujah it's not only your flesh
[57:27] which is Exempted from judgments
[57:37] before
[58:12] [Music]
[58:26] [Applause]
[58:26] [Music]
[59:33] so is
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:31] the blood goes right there
[1:00:34] why
[1:00:42] for God so loved the world
[1:00:45] so this life would then get to this song
[1:00:54] that's the greatest gift
[1:00:57] which we call the gift of life
[1:01:02] amen Amen Let us look at another
[1:01:05] dimension of giving here
[1:01:08] in Ephesians chapter 4 verses

[1:10:11] you just need to be humble because that
[1:10:15] comes from God
[1:10:17] we don't use our gifts right
[1:10:21] God can take them away
[1:10:27] engage
[1:10:44] for God so loved the world
[1:10:47] that he gave his only begotten himself
[1:10:52] after giving
[1:10:54] and you receive then God demands
[1:11:04] that's First John 3 16 let's go there
[1:11:07] University

[1:12:06] I benefited from Ephesians 4 11.
[1:12:12] and he gave some to be Apostles
[1:12:16] and once you receive you give him
[1:12:19] simplest things
[1:12:21] we become to focus the extension of the
[1:12:25] ministry of Christ

[1:14:31] if I be lifted up from the earth went
[1:14:34] away
[1:14:43] let our lives
[1:14:47] in a sense of Simplicity
[1:14:54] to preach Christ in our work
[1:14:58] that's the greatest Ministry
[1:15:03] so we need to take the revelation of
[1:15:06] this message
[1:15:18] so God has raised us up
[1:15:21] in this last day
[1:15:42] is in itself
[1:15:47] by living the life of
[1:15:50] Christo you are being able to give us
[1:15:54] the essence of giving
[1:15:57] don't look at it from the top of it here
[1:16:01] we
[1:16:03] ought to live and live I mean a giving
[1:16:05] life missionaries
[1:16:13] foreign
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:42] [Applause]
[1:17:13] that's the way the servant
[1:17:22] [Applause]
[1:17:24] opens himself up
[1:17:27] just to take from me
[1:17:31] amen amen he just opens up there's
[1:17:35] nothing for himself he said it's for
[1:17:38] others that's what Christ become
[1:17:42] when he become king folks to us
[1:17:46] amen he became a man but the world might
[1:17:50] partake of his righteousness
[1:17:53] and be made sons of God hallelujah
[1:18:00] eternal life
[1:18:02] is living forever
[1:18:07] haha
[1:18:08] but when you think
[1:18:10] this is my life I have to live my life
[1:18:15] that's not a Christian Style
[1:18:19] we live 12 for others we are giving
[1:18:24] the one we live our life is the giving
[1:18:27] thank you
[1:18:28] look at the parable of the tariffs
[1:18:33] it hides another Essence
[1:18:41] is the more we get back yes it is
[1:18:51] it teaches that three people were given
[1:18:55] different measures
[1:19:01] basing on their different abilities of
[1:19:04] management
[1:19:07] so one two five
[1:19:10] Titan and never took three years
[1:19:19] foreign
[1:19:30] [Applause]
[1:19:43] amen amen if God makes you a musician
[1:19:47] that will never fall or maybe multiply
[1:19:49] the talent challenge every gift you have
[1:19:53] foreign
[1:21:05] started to ask for what Peter did not
[1:21:08] have yeah
[1:21:12] Peter looked at him and told him such as
[1:21:16] I have yeah
[1:21:17] I give entropy
[1:21:22] so every child of God he has got a
[1:21:26] channel
[1:21:27] that he drinks in from the stream of the
[1:21:30] Holy Spirit
[1:21:34] and when you drink it
[1:21:38] shall flow rivers of Living Water
[1:21:43] amen there will always be something for
[1:21:46] you together
[1:21:48] when I started out in the ministry
[1:21:52] I started listening to the forefathers
[1:21:56] foreign
[1:22:10] [Music]
[1:22:26] [Applause]
[1:22:35] now
[1:23:00] again
[1:23:36] huh let me preach it around in a
[1:23:39] different way here let's go to Isaiah
[1:23:40] 55.
[1:23:45] he says so shall my word be according to
[1:23:49] make sure
[1:23:50] that goeth out from my mouth again it
[1:23:56] shall not return unto me voice
[1:24:00] that which I please
[1:24:14] he says I can never send my word
[1:24:16] according and my word fails
[1:24:21] sometimes we are talking about the
[1:24:23] promises
[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:38] so when you go out as a gifts
[1:24:43] when you stand in your position
[1:24:49] and Jesus said yes as my father sent me
[1:24:53] yours
[1:24:59] praise the Lord amen so let us look at
[1:25:03] the word as promises
[1:25:09] now John 3 I mean 6 63.
[1:25:15] he says it is the spirit that quickness
[1:25:21] [Applause]
[1:25:23] but flesh profess nothing
[1:25:29] the words that I speak unto you
[1:25:34] they are Spirit moyo and they are life
[1:25:40] such as I have is
[1:25:46] so when God brings you into the body
[1:25:50] He blesses you under a specific way of
[1:25:55] understanding him
[1:26:00] okay and now when you really catch the
[1:26:05] revelation of who that Christ is
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:11] positioning
[1:26:15] then he must make sure that he quickens
[1:26:19] that gifts
[1:26:24] and when you go out double from the Holy
[1:26:28] Spirit
[1:26:28] stands behind that gift
[1:26:31] to back it up
[1:26:36] as I told you the other time
[1:26:38] that First Corinthians 13.
[1:26:42] charity must stand behind every gift
[1:26:47] and the Charities the life God himself
[1:26:53] now listen he chose to deal with the
[1:26:57] intellectual prowess of a man yes
[1:27:01] but God chose the heart
[1:27:06] but
[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:19] to the hearts
[1:27:22] God ministers life
[1:27:26] from the same message
[1:27:31] are you hearing what I say
[1:27:34] if you are a True Believer
[1:27:37] God will affect your heart
[1:27:43] and make it flood the issues of Life
[1:27:48] you'll be able to understand
[1:27:51] we cannot be like one another
[1:27:55] foreign
[1:28:26] [Applause]
[1:28:38] are you together with it because you are
[1:28:41] supposed to preach life
[1:28:43] to the people who want to amen amen not
[1:28:46] preach one another to preach the Life of
[1:28:50] Christ too
[1:28:54] I don't come here to preach how special
[1:28:57] yeah
[1:28:59] I know that I'm just a little peace
[1:29:03] in the calling of God
[1:29:06] and as I stand in front of us I
[1:29:10] recognize
[1:29:11] every one of you
[1:29:14] to be part to say
[1:29:21] amen amen
[1:29:23] pick up the letter of the message
[1:29:27] and use it like he did in the garden
[1:29:33] he can give the letter is a false
[1:29:38] application
[1:29:39] but he cannot as well Minister it is
[1:29:45] amen exactly
[1:29:47] amen because he cannot go behind that
[1:29:51] scripture
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:29:57] to give it to you
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:02] he remains with the letter
[1:30:05] there is no way out of that message
[1:30:09] the devil can ever emphasize the life of
[1:30:12] the world
[1:30:15] because that life is the life of the
[1:30:19] blood
[1:30:20] I'm the devil understand that's going to
[1:30:23] want anything to do with the blood
[1:30:28] foreign
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:31:05] it's not good enough
[1:31:08] for you to come here to know that you
[1:31:12] are in the message because you have been
[1:31:14] baptized right
[1:31:16] you dress right yeah you you know you
[1:31:19] you are a very decent person
[1:31:23] this message is not about being paid I
[1:31:27] mean decent Church
[1:31:29] it goes deeper than that
[1:31:33] it's touching the Life of Christ
[1:31:39] foreign
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:32:11] Temple Ministers of the New Testament
[1:32:14] yes
[1:32:16] you are also an evil minister of the new
[1:32:21] testamentium
[1:32:23] if you understand the New Testament
[1:32:27] he says this is my new testament yeah
[1:33:00] which is your life
[1:33:05] it says not of the letter
[1:33:08] but of the spirit
[1:33:10] for the letter killer that the spirit
[1:33:14] giveth life
[1:33:18] we are not in the world
[1:33:20] until what we know
[1:33:24] translates into life
[1:33:30] are you together with me what is it yeah
[1:33:32] because if you are in it
[1:33:36] by understanding it or wrote together it
[1:33:39] will stop here
[1:33:42] but if the Holy Ghost ministers to your
[1:33:45] soul I remember
[1:33:48] it will produce life
[1:33:52] and you know this is where we are going
[1:33:56] when we are talking about Divine
[1:34:00] fellowships
[1:34:05] amen amen Divine fellas
[1:34:11] not just being in church here
[1:34:15] but a Divine Fellowship
[1:34:21] it must be God
[1:34:24] foreign
[1:34:33] Divine Fellowship
[1:34:37] so the word of God is Not voided
[1:34:44] it returns manifestation it is
[1:34:48] so shall my word
[1:34:53] but goeth out of my mouth
[1:34:57] it shall not return voice
[1:35:01] amen Amina God is Not vain in his words
[1:35:06] because his
[1:35:08] Spirit Warrior and life
[1:35:13] when that God Goes Forth
[1:35:18] it creates a body of a manifestation
[1:35:30] the body of Jesus Christ
[1:35:34] it builds the body around it
[1:35:41] up my God a body so that we can become
[1:35:46] the body of the world
[1:35:48] and that this external body is
[1:35:52] a manifestation
[1:35:55] of what God is doing on this side of us
[1:36:00] amen amen so the words that I speak unto
[1:36:03] your spirit and life
[1:36:07] meaning that under the spoken word
[1:36:10] they are lazy creative anointing
[1:36:14] he was so God's word has got enough
[1:36:19] power the transform itself into living
[1:36:23] substance
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:35] it is a revelation of the Life of Christ
[1:36:40] amen amen
[1:36:43] let's go to this court here
[1:36:45] in the third see
[1:36:47] he says before it's a word
[1:36:50] it is a thought
[1:36:53] has to be created so God's thoughts
[1:36:57] become creation when it was Spock
[1:37:04] so when I speak
[1:37:09] the words of eternal life
[1:37:12] I'm creating you by the word into new
[1:37:17] creatures
[1:37:20] God has given us that ability
[1:37:23] to bring to you that creative work okay
[1:37:28] the prophet says that you happy that
[1:37:30] today
[1:37:32] better what God makes every word
[1:37:34] manifest
[1:37:37] he doesn't speak I don't wow
[1:37:45] but he speaks every word just exactly
[1:37:50] amen he doesn't speak vain words
[1:37:55] so when we come down here with the gift
[1:37:59] God has given to us
[1:38:01] and we speak to you and you receive it
[1:38:05] as God's word
[1:38:07] enough creative power behind me yeah
[1:38:15] he doesn't speak
[1:38:18] when he says
[1:38:20] foreign
[1:38:49] foreign
[1:39:40] because it's a creative world
[1:39:43] the world must bear a fruit
[1:39:46] must come alive because it's in itself
[1:39:53] essence of giving um
[1:40:01] it became part of him
[1:40:04] and the guy was asking for money
[1:40:06] [Music]

[1:40:39] before I finish
[1:40:42] Luke chapter six
[1:40:46] foreign
[1:40:50] [Music]

[1:41:23] foreign
[1:41:49] this is a very great scripture
[1:41:51] which is used
[1:41:58] but when you look at it
[1:42:03] he uses the principle
[1:42:06] that stands out both amen amen
[1:42:11] in the negative which container and in
[1:42:14] the positive
[1:42:16] when you act negative towards the people
[1:42:22] you will permanently reap multiply the
[1:42:25] negativity
[1:42:29] but if you give life out to positively
[1:42:34] you will get back positivity from among
[1:42:38] other people
[1:42:41] [Applause]
[1:42:43] give out positive
[1:42:49] be good to your brothers

[1:46:25] how much are you giving
[1:46:29] what of those of Macedonia the men under
[1:46:33] that Grace when they come down here and

[1:47:01] accordance
[1:47:03] to project into the grace that gives
[1:47:09] Christians needs to find an opportunity
[1:47:12] to give from the heart

[1:48:25] whereof he had not before
[1:48:31] that the same might be ready
[1:48:37] as a matter of bounty and not as a
[1:48:41] matter of covetousness
[1:48:48] of covetousness
[1:48:52] praise the Lord
