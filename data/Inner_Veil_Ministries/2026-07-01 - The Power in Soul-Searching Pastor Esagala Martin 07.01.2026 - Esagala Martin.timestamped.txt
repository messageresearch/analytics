[19:16] Father
[19:18] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in
[19:21] such moment Lord
[19:24] our desire is that you may light it upon
[19:26] us
[19:28] that that oh Lord eternal light
[19:33] may spring forth from our hearts Lord
[19:37] as the scripture says that let that
[19:40] little light shine.

[19:46] to let that you have allowed us to know
[19:48] in this hour
[19:51] to be father shown out in our
[19:54] communities.
[19:56] Father to bear the fruit of the same
[20:00] and oh heavenly father that you may
[20:03] guide us in everything that we do.
[20:05] We completely depend upon you
[20:08] even in this hour that we have come in.
[20:10] Lord
[20:12] may you grant to minister to our hearts.
[20:14] Oh heavenly father
[20:16] we thank you for the song service.
[20:19] Father we thank you for the song leader.
[20:22] We thank you for every soul that you
[20:24] have brought in this house. Our prayer,
[20:27] heavenly father, is that you may fulfill
[20:30] your purpose to why you brought each one
[20:31] of us here.
[20:33] For we are but vessels, oh heavenly
[20:35] father, that I am talking of glory.
[20:39] And every other day we desire that you
[20:41] fill us, oh God.
[20:44] Come and speak to us, oh heavenly
[20:45] father. Come and guide us, Lord,
[20:48] according to your will. We love you and
[20:51] appreciate you. In the name of our Lord
[20:53] Jesus Christ, we pray.
[20:56] Amen.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may take your seats for a
[20:59] while.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; I want to greet you all
[21:08] in the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[21:10] Christ
[21:12] and thank you for coming.
[21:15] Uh without you,
[21:18] the minister has no work.
[21:22] Praise the name of the Lord.
[21:24] So uh uh pastor our pastors are not
[21:27] around.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Uh pastor James who was with brother
[21:31] Steven in today
[21:38] and I just want to thank them for the
[21:40] opportunity they have given me to stand
[21:42] here
[21:46] as as as I ask you to pray with me.
[21:51] Many times you find that it is a little
[21:54] bit trickier to break into the mind of
[21:56] God for the service.
[22:07] But God has his way
[22:10] and that's what I'm trusting on.
[22:13] Will you pray with me?
[22:15] Amen.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Uh let's get into the reading of the
[22:19] word.
[22:25] Do you appreciate brother Joshua for the
[22:26] song service?
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Do you need a revival?
[22:35] Yeah.
[22:37] I heard that song and I was like the
[22:38] spirit is speaking
[22:43] in the direction we are taking this
[22:45] evening.
[22:48] In the book of Matthew chapter 26
[22:53] verse 69
[22:57] up to 75
[23:05] the scripture says
[23:08] &gt;&gt; now Peter sat without in the palace and
[23:12] Adamo came unto him saying thou also was
[23:17] with Jesus of Galilee.
[23:35] But he denied before them all, saying, I
[23:38] know not what thou sayest.
[23:48] And when he was gone out into the porch,
[23:50] another maid saw him and said unto unto
[23:54] them that were there, "This fellow was
[23:57] also with Jesus of Nazareth,
[24:14] And again he denied with an oath, I do
[24:17] not know the man.
[24:23] And after a while came unto him, they
[24:27] that stood by, and say to Peter, Surely
[24:30] thou also at one of them, for thy speech
[24:36] bewest thee.
[24:52] Then began he to c and to swear saying,
[24:55] I know not the man. And immediately the
[24:58] coke crew.
[25:09] And Peter remembered the word of Jesus,
[25:12] which said unto him before the cockro,
[25:15] "Thou shalt deny me thrice." And he went
[25:17] out and weeped bitterly.
[25:33] Let's pray. Lord Jesus, this is your
[25:36] word.
[25:38] Father, we can't understand it with our
[25:40] intellectual,
[25:43] it takes your spirit to come and quicken
[25:46] every letter that we have read.
[25:50] And Lord, we call upon that Lord
[25:54] that you may father give life to each
[25:55] one of these letters
[25:59] to to be to be swn in the hearts of the
[26:01] people.
[26:04] Father, they may bear witness of your
[26:06] word
[26:09] in Jesus's name we pray.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; You may take your seats.
[26:16] Uh this
[26:19] this evening
[26:21] I want to take a subject on the power in
[26:24] soul searching.
[26:28] Soul searching.
[26:31] Amen.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Which better
[26:38] &gt;&gt; you know soul searching
[26:41] &gt;&gt; and soul searching
[26:44] in the English dictionary they refer to
[26:46] it refers to a process of deep and
[26:49] honest self-examination.
[26:56] Deep honest self-examination.
[27:05] It involves critically reflecting one's
[27:09] belief,
[27:14] motives, actions, and spiritual or moral
[27:18] state.
[27:22] Often with the intent of gaining
[27:24] clarity,
[27:26] correction, or renewal.
[27:35] So in brief
[27:38] soul searching um
[27:41] &gt;&gt; it means uh to think on your wise
[27:46] to think about the things you do
[27:50] to think about your motives
[27:54] to think about you know uh why you do
[27:56] certain things.
[28:00] And what is your purpose?
[28:02] Praise the name of the Lord. So, and
[28:04] this selfexamination
[28:07] its intent
[28:10] or the purpose to why you do this
[28:11] self-examination
[28:14] is because you want renew.
[28:18] You want to correct your wise
[28:21] or you want you know to be clear about
[28:24] certain things of your life.
[28:29] Because many times
[28:31] you'll find that there are things that
[28:33] we do
[28:36] but we just follow a certain group of
[28:38] people.
[28:40] Like today people have smartphones
[28:44] and when they go online they see a
[28:47] certain behavior.
[28:49] see a certain kind of you know aspect
[28:53] or something someone did
[28:56] and they want to copy that
[28:58] and walk with that.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And
[29:02] sometimes
[29:04] we live in a certain kind of uh you know
[29:07] situation
[29:09] that you wake up in the morning,
[29:12] you do a certain activity
[29:15] and the day goes
[29:18] and then in the morning you wake up do
[29:20] the same activity
[29:22] and you're continuing in that in that
[29:24] pattern.
[29:26] But if someone finds you and ask you why
[29:28] you do it,
[29:32] you don't have a justification for that
[29:36] &gt;&gt; and you don't have any spiritual, you
[29:38] know, you know, benefit from it.
[29:44] Praise the name of the Lord. So just
[29:46] picking up a quote here
[29:49] in why I think Pentecost
[29:55] the prophet says
[29:57] Now when a man is got a soul
[30:02] that soul want to reason with God's word
[30:07] believe it
[30:10] intellectual mind will reason with God's
[30:12] word
[30:15] that may be fanaticism
[30:19] I don't know whether to do that
[30:24] watch out
[30:26] that comes from the Bible.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; You search it.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "And your soul,
[30:35] &gt;&gt; if it's got the Holy Spirit,
[30:39] will search it
[30:45] and reorganize it." So the prophet is
[30:48] talking about you know some things that
[30:50] we pick from the Bible
[30:55] and he says that you know a man without
[30:57] the Holy Ghost
[31:00] will take the word of God and reason
[31:02] reason with it.
[31:05] But a man that has got the Holy Spirit
[31:09] will search the scriptures
[31:12] and will recognize that these things are
[31:15] from the scriptures.
[31:18] And such a man will always get back to
[31:21] the scriptures when he's doing any kind
[31:23] of self-examination.
[31:28] Praise the name of the Lord. When you
[31:30] see to think on your wise,
[31:33] you must, you know, have a blueprint
[31:39] that you're using to think on your wise.
[31:42] It is just like nowadays
[31:45] that some of the young men
[31:47] they cut their hair
[31:50] they just wake up one wakes up in the
[31:52] morning
[31:54] and goes to a salon
[31:56] &gt;&gt; and says I want to I want to trim my
[31:57] head
[31:59] and the baba will do whatsoever he
[32:01] wants.
[32:03] But when you think about the style that
[32:05] the baba is trimming you
[32:09] know where it comes from.
[32:11] Praise the name of the Lord. You must
[32:14] take time to think on the things that
[32:16] you do,
[32:19] the blueprint of the word.
[32:22] And every man that takes time to think
[32:24] on his ways,
[32:28] the word of God
[32:30] will always run in the way of the Lord.
[32:35] Because God in the beginning,
[32:38] the prophet tells us that everything
[32:41] that we see,
[32:43] everything that God does,
[32:45] he thought about it in the beginning
[32:49] and everything is God's mind,
[32:52] his thoughts,
[32:54] is fulfilling now.
[32:57] Praise the name of the Lord. And you see
[32:59] that when you go into the scriptures
[33:02] and you begin to find yourself,
[33:05] you read the scripture like Mary
[33:08] when the anged her and the angel told
[33:12] her
[33:13] favor before God and Mary was thinking
[33:16] about some of those things
[33:19] and as Mary was interacting with the
[33:21] angel
[33:22] that's why you were so searching
[33:24] you know doing selfexamination
[33:28] wondering Why of all the virgins it's me
[33:32] wondering where is this coming from
[33:36] the angel Mary is going to have a child
[33:40] and Mary after thinking on her ways she
[33:44] finds out she has never been with a man
[33:48] and then she asks the angel how shall it
[33:51] be even I've known no man praise the
[33:54] name of the Lord all that is God
[33:57] fulfilling his thoughts
[34:00] in his mind and the things that he
[34:01] thought before the beginning.
[34:05] Praise the name of the Lord. So as we
[34:08] lay down a foundation here,
[34:10] let's pick up that quote, the
[34:12] identification, the identified
[34:13] masterpiece of God.
[34:16] Uh
[34:18] he says remember there is only one form
[34:20] of eternal life
[34:23] and even our names and our thoughts were
[34:26] with God before there was a foundation
[34:28] of the world
[34:30] because now we possess eternal life
[34:34] because now we possess eternal life
[34:40] and to be that
[34:43] we have to be a part of God.
[34:47] So we we would have to be as much as in
[34:51] his thoughts
[34:55] because we have eternal life
[34:58] and was predestinated to this life and
[35:01] our names were put on the lamb's book of
[35:03] life
[35:06] of the world according to revelations.
[35:10] Now that God had us in his thinking,
[35:16] praise the name of the Lord, then we
[35:18] have eternal life. So the prophet is
[35:21] telling us that at a certain time
[35:25] even before there was time,
[35:28] God is thinking
[35:31] and he was planning what is going to
[35:33] take place
[35:36] before he spoke the earth from the world
[35:38] into existence.
[35:40] And as he was doing that, I want to say
[35:44] God was doing as such
[35:47] to establish the purpose, you know, and
[35:49] the reason why some things should be
[35:51] done.
[35:54] And that's why the prophet teaches us
[35:56] and tell us
[35:58] there's nothing that God did without a
[36:00] purpose.
[36:03] Everything that God does, he has a
[36:06] purpose and motive behind.
[36:09] HAS A TARGET and a goal
[36:12] that something ahead
[36:14] is seeing the image of Christ in you
[36:18] test you through the journey that you're
[36:20] going through
[36:22] that's why none of us has a control over
[36:24] his life
[36:26] because God is looking at a certain goal
[36:30] he wants you to be
[36:32] in 2030 maybe in 2030
[36:36] maybe in December of this
[36:39] The Lord has a goal of your life.
[36:42] Surrender to him. He will fulfill his
[36:46] mind.
[36:48] Praise the name of the Lord. Because he
[36:50] knew you before even you came into your
[36:52] mother's womb.
[36:54] So the prophet continues and says here,
[36:57] see how this works.
[37:00] God always had his thoughts for Adam.
[37:05] Adam has his thoughts.
[37:08] was yet unexpressed.
[37:11] And he picks that scripture in the book
[37:12] of Psalms 139
[37:16] and says,
[37:18] "My substance was not hid from thee,
[37:23] when I was made in secret,
[37:26] and curiously wrote in the lowest parts
[37:29] of the earth."
[37:35] Thine eyes did see my substance,
[37:39] yet being perfect.
[37:42] In thy book were all my members written,
[37:48] which incontinence
[37:50] were fashioned when as yet there was
[37:53] none of them.
[37:58] So in this scripture,
[38:01] David is you know speaking to the Lord
[38:05] and says that my substance you know you
[38:07] saw them
[38:10] and you wrote my members
[38:13] you wrote me in your book
[38:16] and you fashioned me. He says even
[38:19] before any of my flesh and blood was
[38:25] you saw every bit of me.
[38:28] When God in the beginning
[38:30] was thinking on who to place in earth at
[38:34] which time
[38:37] for you to be here at this time
[38:41] this is the only time
[38:43] you come and walk here's
[38:47] purpose that God had for you.
[38:50] The prophet continues and says
[38:53] as I said was not written about Adam
[38:59] He gives you the idea
[39:02] that the thought was there in his mind
[39:08] and that thought was eternal
[39:11] and had to be expressed.
[39:14] So when Adam was formed of the dust of
[39:16] the earth
[39:18] and his spiritual being created by God,
[39:23] then Adam became God's thought
[39:25] expressed.
[39:28] And those eternal thoughts were now
[39:31] manifest.
[39:34] Praise the name of the Lord. You see God
[39:37] before he did anything,
[39:40] he sat down and examined everything.
[39:44] A masterpiece why everything has to be
[39:47] done in a certain way.
[39:51] And that's why God's word cannot fail or
[39:54] cannot be moved.
[39:59] because God runs surely and you know
[40:02] he's certain of what he's going to do.
[40:07] Praise the name of the Lord. Let's pick
[40:09] up Jeremiah 17 and verse 10.
[40:15] As we get in our subject,
[40:17] he says, "I the Lord search the heart
[40:22] and I try the rights even to give every
[40:26] man according to his wise and according
[40:28] to the fruit of his doings.
[40:46] So God searches our hearts.
[40:50] God searches our souls.
[40:53] God searches our minds.
[40:56] And he knows exactly what we think.
[41:01] He knows the motives of every action
[41:03] that we do.
[41:06] even before you do something that you
[41:07] have planned for a while
[41:11] because you're going to do it
[41:13] and why you're going to do it.
[41:16] And the scripture tells us
[41:19] he gives to every man according to his
[41:21] wise,
[41:25] the things that you do, the fruits of
[41:28] your doing.
[41:30] Praise the name of the Lord. And that's
[41:33] why we need to be very careful.
[41:36] to do certain things
[41:39] and the kind or you know all the the the
[41:43] nature of our life.
[41:47] Praise the name of the Lord. So getting
[41:49] back to soul searching
[41:56] there are purposes of soul searching
[42:01] purposes of of self-examination.
[42:05] And one is to discover why you do
[42:08] certain things.
[42:12] So before you're going to do something,
[42:14] you ought to find out why you're going
[42:17] to do it.
[42:19] Praise the name of the Lord. And this
[42:21] goes through, you know, a an examination
[42:24] using the word of God.
[42:28] Levil temps you into a snare.
[42:34] Praise the name of the Lord. So touching
[42:36] is about asking and understanding the
[42:38] fundamental motivation
[42:41] is about asking and understanding the
[42:43] fundamental
[42:48] the fundamental motivations
[42:52] for your existence
[42:55] guiding principles in your life.
[42:59] So you look at the principles that you
[43:01] have in your life
[43:06] and you ask yourself why do I do this
[43:09] every morning?
[43:12] How does it help me spiritually?
[43:15] How far does it bring me to God?
[43:20] Praise the name of the Lord. And when
[43:23] you do a soarch,
[43:25] you want to find out you know to have a
[43:28] selfawareness
[43:31] of the things that you do on a daily,
[43:33] you know, routine
[43:36] because there are things that you do
[43:39] just by reflex.
[43:42] But at the end of every day, you should
[43:45] be able to sit down and find out what
[43:49] did I do today?
[43:52] And where did I reach
[43:55] for the goal that I had?
[43:58] How far do these things bring me to God?
[44:02] Walking in the way of the Lord
[44:06] away from the will of the Lord.
[44:09] Praise the name of the Lord. So you must
[44:12] also find meaning and purpose
[44:15] for the things that you're planning to
[44:17] do ahead.
[44:19] Praise the name of the Lord. So
[44:21] self-examination
[44:24] also helps us to enhance decision making
[44:28] to look at the decisions that you're
[44:30] going to make.
[44:33] You may have every other day we are
[44:35] standing at a junction
[44:38] and you want to make a decision on which
[44:40] route you should take.
[44:44] But you can only make a right decision
[44:47] when you have studied the word of the
[44:49] Lord
[44:51] when you have studied the circumstances
[44:52] around you.
[44:55] when you have seen all the actions that
[44:57] you might do and their futs at the end
[44:59] of the day.
[45:03] Praise the name of the Lord. I hope we
[45:05] are together up to now.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; So let's just take Judah.
[45:10] You see Judah escarot
[45:13] &gt;&gt; was a very faithful member in the church
[45:14] of Jesus Christ
[45:18] to the extent that Jesus Christ
[45:21] entrusted Judah's carot
[45:24] with the bag of the church
[45:26] but
[45:28] a certain time came
[45:31] where he was you know allotted with two
[45:34] wives
[45:36] he was given two wives
[45:40] He was given two ways.
[45:44] One way was to walk with Jesus
[45:48] and take the silver and gold.
[45:51] The other was for him to get the 30
[45:53] pieces of silver
[45:56] and Judah without doing a thorough
[45:58] examination.
[46:02] Judah went with 30 silvers pieces of
[46:05] silver
[46:08] and Judah betrayed Jesus Christ.
[46:13] But Judah reached a point
[46:15] and he did what he was meant to do
[46:17] before
[46:19] and his wife started to do a self
[46:23] examination. started search
[46:27] found that he was wanting
[46:31] but the decision that he had MADE
[46:35] and Judah tried to find a way of
[46:38] cleaning HIMSELF
[46:43] because he didn't do as such
[46:46] he went on acting
[46:49] of the lord so in the book of matthew
[46:51] chapter 27
[46:54] the scriptures size. Then Judah, which
[46:57] had betrayed him, when he saw that he
[47:00] was condemned, repented himself, and
[47:03] brought again the 30 the 30 pieces of
[47:06] silver to the chief priest at elders.
[47:23] Praise the name of the Lord. So
[47:26] condemnation
[47:29] is something that comes
[47:31] after you have done a a thorough so so
[47:35] such.
[47:38] You've thought about everything you've
[47:40] done.
[47:42] You thought about your wives.
[47:45] You thought about your actions
[47:47] and then you begin pointing at your
[47:49] actions
[47:51] and say when I did this it wasn't right.
[47:55] When I did this that wasn't a right
[47:58] thing. When I did this I was walking in
[48:01] the word of the Lord. So we see that
[48:04] Judah
[48:05] was condemned
[48:08] because he did so such
[48:10] and he saw that you know HE WAS WANTING
[48:15] SO THE SCRIPTURE says after Judah doing
[48:18] a such
[48:20] he brought again 30 pieces of silver
[48:24] from the people that gave him.
[48:27] He saw that what he did was not right.
[48:30] And the scripture says that when he came
[48:33] to the chief priests
[48:35] he said I have sinned in that I have
[48:37] betrayed the innocent blood.
[48:42] I have sinned in that I will destroy the
[48:45] innocence.
[48:50] Praise the name of the Lord. You see
[48:52] Judah, he has done something wrong
[48:56] before doing so or such.
[48:59] He has just went into something
[49:02] because he saw another brother doing it.
[49:05] He has gone into something because he
[49:08] has seen another man doing it.
[49:10] And after he has done it, he comes back
[49:14] to church and he hears the Holy Spirit
[49:18] speaking to him. And when Judah BEGINS
[49:21] TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HE DID,
[49:24] he remembers that all that was not
[49:26] right.
[49:28] God don't do those things.
[49:31] RIE PRIEST AND HE SAYS, I have sinned.
[49:36] Praise the name of THE LORD. AND HE
[49:38] SAYS, YOU KNOW THE SCRIPTURE SAYS HERE
[49:42] &gt;&gt; and they said what is that to us? See
[49:46] thou to that see thou to that and in
[49:50] verse five and he cast down the pieces
[49:52] of silver in the temple and departed and
[49:55] went and hunged himself. Uhhuh.
[50:08] Praise the name of the Lord.
[50:11] After doing a soul search, he didn't
[50:14] find any grace for himself.
[50:18] He didn't find any place where he could
[50:20] fit
[50:22] because he condemned himself
[50:27] examination
[50:29] to think on his work.
[50:32] that he was wanting
[50:35] and Judah didn't know that there was
[50:37] grace for any sinner
[50:43] because of the things that he did. But
[50:45] thank God we are living in a day where
[50:49] there is grace for such things.
[50:53] We have read in in in Matthew 26
[50:56] and we have seen how Peter
[50:59] Peter was standing in the same place
[51:03] he was with Jesus and he spoke to Jesus
[51:06] and he said I'm going to fight for you.
[51:09] No one will take you TO BEHIND AND JESUS
[51:12] TOLD him get behind me Satan. And Jesus
[51:16] told him that before you know the co
[51:21] deny me three times. And Peter did not
[51:25] think about that.
[51:28] PETER thought that this is a normal
[51:30] talk.
[51:33] You see Peter when he came where Jesus
[51:36] was when Jesus was taken by these people
[51:39] here
[51:41] was approached by people three times.
[51:46] And how forgotten the words of Jesus
[51:50] was wrong with Peter
[51:52] was not doing so searching himself
[51:56] person comes and says you are part of
[51:58] him and he says no sir I don't know that
[52:02] man
[52:04] and Peter was confident
[52:08] praise the name of the lord another
[52:10] group comes and says but you talk like
[52:12] him you are part of him says no sir
[52:20] what's wrong with Peter Peter was not
[52:22] doing SO SUCH
[52:25] THAT WAS enough for Peter to know
[52:28] why am I denying the person I've walked
[52:30] with for three years
[52:34] Peter could have remembered
[52:38] I'm going to deny him
[52:42] of
[52:47] another group of people.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; You are like him. And he said, "No." And
[52:55] when Peter had the coke,
[52:58] that was an
[53:01] for him,
[53:03] for him to think about the things he has
[53:05] been to him.
[53:07] Oh God,
[53:10] have mercy upon me.
[53:13] recognized
[53:15] that there is grace
[53:17] for a sinner
[53:19] that has gone away
[53:22] that has tried.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So in
[53:26] moments of anything that we have to do,
[53:30] we need to do so
[53:33] on our wise
[53:37] action that we do because realizing that
[53:41] we are sons of God and knowing that
[53:44] there is nothing ours here.
[53:47] Everything that we have is given of God
[53:50] and if at all we will we give back to
[53:53] God
[53:55] like David in the book of Chronicles.
[53:59] David in the book of Chronicles
[54:04] knowing that God, you know, wanted him
[54:07] to build a house
[54:11] and David, you know, rather David wanted
[54:12] to build God a house.
[54:16] And God said, "Your son will build a
[54:18] house."
[54:20] He knew that all that he had was of God.
[54:25] And David did not withhold anything.
[54:30] And David gave back to God
[54:35] that all that I have is yours. THEY HAVE
[54:38] BEEN GIVEN to me by you.
[54:41] And David said, "I'm so blessed THAT I
[54:44] CAN GIVE back to you of what you have
[54:47] given to me."
[54:50] SO DAVID RECOGNIZED THAT everything that
[54:53] I have
[54:55] is given of God. Even just breathing
[54:57] it's of God.
[55:01] So it's really, you know, worth it
[55:04] to to worship God
[55:07] WITH ALL OF OUR HEARTS
[55:09] and thinking on on our ways
[55:12] in the ways of the Lord.
[55:15] Listen what the prophet says in the
[55:18] message as I thought on my wise.
[55:22] He say think on your selfstyled wise.
[55:29] Think think on that bunch of creeds that
[55:31] you are serving in in the east in the
[55:34] state of serving the real living God.
[55:40] Except a man be born again,
[55:43] he will in no way see the kingdom of
[55:45] God.
[55:47] Think on your wise
[55:49] or you might be a doctor of divinity.
[55:53] I don't know what you are.
[55:55] But if you are lost,
[55:58] you better think on your ways,
[56:02] for there is a time coming.
[56:04] He says, "It was when the high priest
[56:07] counted out the 30 pieces of silver to
[56:09] Judah."
[56:14] When he had the ringing of that silver,
[56:18] when he had that ringing of of that
[56:20] silver,
[56:24] Judas thought on his wise
[56:27] and he went and took a rope and hung
[56:29] himself.
[56:33] It was the Roman soldier
[56:37] that when he had stood there
[56:41] and seen the sun go down in the middle
[56:44] of the day,
[56:46] he saw the rocks ring out of the
[56:48] mountains.
[56:52] He had one say, "Father, forgive them
[56:56] for they know not what they do."
[56:59] He had pressed his spear into his heart
[57:04] and seen the water and blood flow out.
[57:08] When he
[57:10] began to think on his words and he fell
[57:13] on his face and screamed and said,
[57:18] "Surely that is the son of God."
[57:22] Begin to think on his ways. when he had
[57:25] seen what he had done.
[57:28] You think of what you've done.
[57:31] Look at the evil
[57:34] power you've put of Christ.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; You intended to be a real Christian.
[57:40] You intended to be filled with the Holy
[57:42] Ghost.
[57:44] You've intended someday, but your
[57:46] intention will never get you there. He
[57:50] hell hell is paved with good intentions.
[58:01] Brother, when you think on your wise
[58:03] things the Roman soldier did.
[58:15] Cry out to God.
[58:17] say truly he is the son of God
[58:21] and I will turn my feet to his testimony
[58:26] for him
[58:28] for me
[58:30] as you see the Holy Spirit moving
[58:34] work great signs and wonders
[58:37] on your wise when you see the last sign
[58:40] that God said will take place
[58:46] was before it that was before it was
[58:50] destroyed.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; When you see that, think on your wise.
[59:01] Think of of what you are doing.
[59:04] If you Christian,
[59:07] think the life you are living.
[59:10] Are you living above the reproach?
[59:13] Are you doing the things that pleases
[59:15] God?
[59:17] Have your heart no condemnation.
[59:20] If you a sinner, you were under the
[59:23] power of God and come to the altar.
[59:28] If you are thinking on your ways while
[59:30] I've been preaching,
[59:34] God has convicted you that you are
[59:36] wrong.
[59:40] Then I can tell you one thing. I can
[59:43] introduce you to something that is here
[59:45] tonight.
[59:48] Praise the name of the Lord. The prophet
[59:51] speaking to us. If you have thought on
[59:54] your wise,
[59:57] repent of where you have gone wrong with
[1:00:01] praise God for where you're walking with
[1:00:03] him.
[1:00:07] Praise the name of the Lord. Look at
[1:00:09] Moses
[1:00:11] in the book of Exodus chapter 3
[1:00:14] and then verse one. The scripture says,
[1:00:17] "Now Moses
[1:00:19] as he kept the flock of Jethro his
[1:00:21] father,
[1:00:23] you know, Moses was at the back side of
[1:00:25] the desert
[1:00:27] and he was, you know, railing the the
[1:00:30] ship
[1:00:32] and the angel came to him
[1:00:35] and the angel appeared."
[1:00:38] And Moses when he thought about it
[1:00:41] in verse the scripture, the scripture
[1:00:43] says, "And the angel of the Lord
[1:00:44] appeared unto him in a flame of fire
[1:00:50] out of the midst of a bush,
[1:00:53] and he looked, and behold, the bush
[1:00:55] burned with fire,
[1:00:59] and the bush was not consumed."
[1:01:02] And when Moses saw this
[1:01:05] and fought on his wives,
[1:01:08] did so search in himself.
[1:01:11] He said I will turn
[1:01:14] to see what is this
[1:01:16] because it was an you know something
[1:01:19] that is not usual.
[1:01:23] And the scripture says and Moses said I
[1:01:26] will now turn aside and see this great
[1:01:28] site.
[1:01:32] Why the bush is not burnt? And when the
[1:01:35] Lord saw that he turned aside to see,
[1:01:38] God called unto him out of the midst of
[1:01:40] the bush.
[1:01:51] Praise the name of the Lord. So we see
[1:01:53] that in verse four,
[1:01:55] the scripture says, "When the Lord saw
[1:01:58] that he turned aside,
[1:02:05] So imagine if Moses did not turn.
[1:02:09] If Moses didn't just looked at that bush
[1:02:12] and just went on
[1:02:16] looked at it
[1:02:18] and said this one is usual.
[1:02:24] The scripture says when the Lord saw
[1:02:26] that he turned,
[1:02:30] so when saw the fire, when Moses saw the
[1:02:34] bush,
[1:02:36] he thought about it
[1:02:38] and he said, "This is not usual."
[1:02:42] Praise the name of the Lord. And he
[1:02:44] turned
[1:02:45] and when he turned, God saw a heart that
[1:02:49] is willing to perform his will.
[1:02:56] Praise the name of the Lord. And the
[1:02:58] scripture and the prophet says here in
[1:03:01] the messages I thought on my way,
[1:03:04] he says it was Moses,
[1:03:07] the mighty prophet,
[1:03:09] an old shiper.
[1:03:12] He had returned into be.
[1:03:16] He had returned to be
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; that was wandering back behind the
[1:03:24] mountain
[1:03:27] one day on a little old path
[1:03:30] that the sheep had made.
[1:03:36] Perhaps it was very familiar to him.
[1:03:40] But that morning was just a little
[1:03:42] different from other mornings.
[1:03:46] There seem to be something around him.
[1:03:50] You know Jesus said if they hold their
[1:03:54] peace,
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; the rocks will cry out.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; I wonder if wasn't preaching to him.
[1:04:03] Sorry. I wonder if the angels wasn't
[1:04:05] preaching to him.
[1:04:09] All of a sudden he begin to think on his
[1:04:11] wise
[1:04:14] how that he had made a failure in life
[1:04:19] and had tried to find safety while his
[1:04:22] people was in bondage.
[1:04:27] God grant the heart of every preacher of
[1:04:30] every preacher here
[1:04:34] will get that burden get that burden.
[1:04:42] How can we rest in Zion
[1:04:46] when the world is covered with sin?
[1:04:49] And then he says in paragraph 34,
[1:04:53] Moses be to think on his wise
[1:04:56] how that he had went off in his own
[1:04:59] schooling and training
[1:05:03] and he knew there was a call of God on
[1:05:06] his life.
[1:05:08] He tried to to work it out his own way.
[1:05:13] Never preachers get in that trouble.
[1:05:17] a call of God in our life
[1:05:20] and then go off and get a schooling that
[1:05:22] tells us that the days of miracles are
[1:05:24] passed
[1:05:29] and there is no such a thing as baptism
[1:05:31] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:05:36] And then he says down as you just scroll
[1:05:39] down and he says and as he begin to
[1:05:41] think on those things
[1:05:45] I can see him become all tore up
[1:05:50] there is no man who can come into the
[1:05:52] presence of his own past
[1:05:57] what gets to up about it.
[1:06:02] I pray that the Holy Spirit will bring
[1:06:04] every human being in here now back to
[1:06:06] your past.
[1:06:12] Then turn to his testimony.
[1:06:15] And as you begin to think, I can see
[1:06:18] that old man with flow with flowing
[1:06:21] white beard.
[1:06:24] But he said, I've ruined my life.
[1:06:27] I'm 8 years old.
[1:06:30] If I would have thought of it when I was
[1:06:32] a young man,
[1:06:34] I would have would have done the right
[1:06:36] thing.
[1:06:38] But now it is too far
[1:06:40] and and a great crystal tears rolling
[1:06:44] down his white whisks.
[1:06:48] When he was thinking on his wise, there
[1:06:51] was a cracking noise on the side of the
[1:06:53] hill.
[1:06:56] While he was thinking on his wise,
[1:06:59] he said, "I will turn aside to see what
[1:07:01] this thing God has done
[1:07:05] that God will bring that burning bush in
[1:07:07] the hearing in the hearing distance of
[1:07:09] every person here.
[1:07:14] We can see on our wise
[1:07:17] changed Moses when he turned his feet
[1:07:20] from the path of Moses,
[1:07:23] the path that God had led him through
[1:07:25] the Red Sea.
[1:07:28] And it changed Moses when he turned his
[1:07:30] feet from the path of ship
[1:07:39] to the path that God led him through the
[1:07:41] Red Sea.
[1:07:47] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:07:50] So let's just pick up another scripture
[1:07:53] here
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; in the book of Luke chapter 15.
[1:08:04] It's it's it's worth it to think on our
[1:08:06] ways.
[1:08:09] It spies it pies a lot to think before
[1:08:13] we do some of the things.
[1:08:19] I just want us to take this young man
[1:08:21] here
[1:08:24] and we shall close.
[1:08:27] He says in verse 11,
[1:08:30] and he said a certain man
[1:08:33] had two sons,
[1:08:37] and the younger of them said to his
[1:08:39] father,
[1:08:41] "Father, give me the portion of goods
[1:08:43] that fall to to me.
[1:08:47] And he divided unto them his living.
[1:08:53] And not many days,
[1:08:56] but a young son gathered all together
[1:09:00] his journey into a far country
[1:09:04] his substance with righteous living.
[1:09:10] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:09:12] We see this young man.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; He's standing like Judah.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; He goes to the father.
[1:09:21] Give me my portion
[1:09:23] and I go.
[1:09:27] He didn't see himself
[1:09:30] in the pig pen.
[1:09:34] He didn't see himself
[1:09:37] living a miserable life.
[1:09:42] He thought that he can stand without his
[1:09:44] father
[1:09:47] because he has seen many other men,
[1:09:50] seen many other young men
[1:09:53] running from their father's house,
[1:09:56] running from their fathers.
[1:10:00] And you know many people lay such an
[1:10:02] example.
[1:10:05] And those of you my agement, you know,
[1:10:07] we have many friends who are like that.
[1:10:14] who think they don't need a shepherd.
[1:10:17] They think they don't need counel.
[1:10:22] They just wake up
[1:10:24] and do whatever they want.
[1:10:26] That's what this young man was.
[1:10:30] He just woke up
[1:10:32] not doing a such
[1:10:35] not thinking about his father and the
[1:10:38] responsibilities of his father in his
[1:10:39] life.
[1:10:44] He said I don't need him.
[1:10:47] All I need is his goods.
[1:10:50] I give my portion
[1:10:52] and I go I don't need him anymore.
[1:10:56] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:10:58] such a very quick and very bad decision
[1:11:03] to make.
[1:11:07] You know when you follow that scripture,
[1:11:11] you find that this man
[1:11:15] the father gave him
[1:11:17] because the father gives us a free moral
[1:11:20] agent
[1:11:23] and he lets us live the way we we
[1:11:25] desire.
[1:11:29] But remember, he's always saying, "Come
[1:11:31] back if you will.
[1:11:35] Come unto me." He's calling us back to
[1:11:39] him. It doesn't matter how far you've
[1:11:42] gone.
[1:11:44] Any point
[1:11:46] when you think on your ways and you
[1:11:49] remember the goodness of the father
[1:11:52] just stand back and say father
[1:11:55] I've remembered
[1:11:57] I recall and I repent
[1:12:01] this young man here came to the father
[1:12:04] and said give me my my portion and I
[1:12:06] live
[1:12:08] and the scripture says he went to a far
[1:12:10] country.
[1:12:12] He didn't even want to be close to his
[1:12:14] father
[1:12:16] because he didn't want the father's
[1:12:17] influence in his life.
[1:12:21] Praise the name of the Lord. And the
[1:12:23] scripture says when he went there,
[1:12:26] he forgot the protection of the father.
[1:12:30] You know that all that he was
[1:12:33] was the father's mercy was the father's
[1:12:38] father's protection
[1:12:40] was the eforts of the father.
[1:12:43] So this young man the scripture tells us
[1:12:47] that they wasted his substance
[1:12:51] with righteous living.
[1:12:54] He was in a strange land
[1:12:57] and he got in bad company.
[1:13:01] and everything that he did. He did have
[1:13:04] the counel of the father
[1:13:08] have the counel of the shepherd
[1:13:12] of the scriptures.
[1:13:14] This man never did a so so
[1:13:19] the spiritual living of God.
[1:13:22] It's just like a man that has ran away
[1:13:26] from the presence of the Lord. Just like
[1:13:29] Jonah is a very perfect example for
[1:13:31] that. God has sent you a certain way and
[1:13:36] then you turn to another place. Praise
[1:13:39] the name of the Lord. And when Jonah
[1:13:42] went into, you know, down into the sea,
[1:13:47] the scripture tells us that Jonah, you
[1:13:49] know, it says that he was in the middle
[1:13:50] of hell
[1:13:54] when my soul fainted within me.
[1:13:58] They saw such as he was in the belly of
[1:14:01] that fish
[1:14:03] and what his heart was gracious
[1:14:10] merciful
[1:14:12] to hear my prayer
[1:14:14] called on the Lord and God heard the
[1:14:17] prayer of Jonah
[1:14:20] to do so such friends.
[1:14:24] When we get in such moments where we
[1:14:26] have deviated away from the word
[1:14:31] in this flesh here
[1:14:33] many times we fall
[1:14:36] many times we error because it is the
[1:14:38] nature of flesh
[1:14:41] Paul in the book of Romans
[1:14:44] chapter 7 and
[1:14:47] suddenly he looks at the law of flesh
[1:14:50] and he looks at the law of the spirit.
[1:14:54] And he says when I want to do good
[1:14:58] before me because it's the nature of
[1:15:00] this flesh.
[1:15:02] But yet God has given us grace that when
[1:15:06] we get in those moments
[1:15:09] to rise up and say God have merc upon
[1:15:11] me.
[1:15:12] So that's that's what happened to this
[1:15:14] young man that when he went down and he
[1:15:18] was not doing a soul search and the
[1:15:21] events that were happening to him until
[1:15:24] he lost the the the last coin he had in
[1:15:28] his life
[1:15:32] until he went and began to eat of the of
[1:15:34] the pig's food
[1:15:38] and it was not free to him
[1:15:41] request of the owner.
[1:15:44] TO EAT OF YOUR PIG'S FOOD.
[1:15:47] SO this young man here made a point and
[1:15:50] thought on his wife
[1:15:52] and thought of his position in his
[1:15:54] father's
[1:15:57] love of the father
[1:15:59] what the father would do for him when he
[1:16:02] goes back
[1:16:06] this young man what he means to do in
[1:16:09] the beginning
[1:16:11] doing it at the end of time.
[1:16:14] So as we live in this life, we ought to
[1:16:18] do these things in in real time.
[1:16:23] The actions that we are going to do
[1:16:26] just run, you know, in bandwagon
[1:16:30] and be influenced by any other person.
[1:16:34] Let us be influenced by our Lord Jesus
[1:16:36] Christ.
[1:16:38] Let us be influenced by the messenger of
[1:16:39] the hour. Let us go west by our
[1:16:42] shepherd.
[1:16:44] You know, I was speaking on on on the
[1:16:46] Lord is my shepherd on Sunday
[1:16:51] and it is so interesting.
[1:16:53] How a sheep follows the shepherd
[1:16:57] and the prophet gave an example
[1:17:00] of how you know he went to to Britain
[1:17:03] and there was a shepherd that was moving
[1:17:06] with his sheep.
[1:17:12] And when he was about to reach the the
[1:17:14] the traffic,
[1:17:17] he went and got the right of way for the
[1:17:19] sheep
[1:17:21] and all the cars stopped to move
[1:17:24] and the shepherd passed.
[1:17:27] And as the shepherd passed,
[1:17:30] all the sheep
[1:17:32] were in a line
[1:17:34] following the shepherd.
[1:17:36] No sheep could turn to the right or the
[1:17:38] left
[1:17:40] focusing on where the shepherd is going.
[1:17:44] But a true sheep
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; follows the shepherd.
[1:17:50] A true sheep
[1:17:52] has a shepherd.
[1:17:54] A true sheep hears the voice of the
[1:17:57] shepherd.
[1:17:59] A true sheep knows only one voice of the
[1:18:02] shepherd.
[1:18:04] You find many flocks of sheep.
[1:18:08] You find many flocks of sheep,
[1:18:11] you know, railing in the same place.
[1:18:14] But when a shepherd, ONE SHEPHERD
[1:18:17] WHISTLES OUT, all sheep will listen him
[1:18:23] because they know the uniqueness of the
[1:18:25] voice of their shepherd.
[1:18:28] Praise the name of the Lord. But all the
[1:18:31] sheep around here
[1:18:34] that belong to that respective shepherd
[1:18:42] says my sheep know my voice
[1:18:46] that of a stranger
[1:18:49] they cannot follow it the name of the
[1:18:52] lord so the prophesize that this MAN WAS
[1:18:56] passing in a market street
[1:19:00] the street
[1:19:02] tables People were ving. Maybe there was
[1:19:06] there. Maybe there was cabbage there.
[1:19:09] And as the shepherd was moving, the
[1:19:12] sheep were focused on the shepherd.
[1:19:15] They were not focusing on the vegetable
[1:19:17] here. On the side, but the sheep never
[1:19:22] turn to eat any vegetable along the sea.
[1:19:26] They were not running with anything they
[1:19:28] find. They were FOCUSED ON ONE CHEF.
[1:19:33] THAT IS THE SHEPHERD that is given of
[1:19:34] the Lord.
[1:19:38] And that's what it takes
[1:19:40] to be a sheep is to know your shepherd
[1:19:45] to know that what my shepherd you know
[1:19:48] does.
[1:19:51] That's what I follow as a sheep as we
[1:19:55] follow the great shepherd our Lord Jesus
[1:19:57] Christ.
[1:19:59] So as a sheep, we must always think on
[1:20:02] our eyes to follow the great shepherd
[1:20:07] shepherd that the Lord has given unto
[1:20:09] us.
[1:20:10] Because it's only the shepherd that the
[1:20:13] Lord has entrusted with all of our
[1:20:15] journey.
[1:20:17] It's only the shepherd that come from
[1:20:19] where we are going. Imagine a ship in
[1:20:22] the wilderness.
[1:20:26] You know, it is so interesting how David
[1:20:29] stands and says,
[1:20:32] "The Lord is my shepherd." It's only a
[1:20:34] sheep that can say that the Lord is my
[1:20:38] shepherd.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Because it knows, all its care
[1:20:44] is laid upon the shepherd.
[1:20:46] All its burden is laid upon the
[1:20:49] shepherd.
[1:20:52] David says, "If I walk into the valley
[1:20:56] of the shadow of death,
[1:20:58] I will not fear
[1:21:01] because the Lord is my shepherd." When
[1:21:05] you have a shepherd,
[1:21:07] you at rest
[1:21:10] of the Lord and any sheep
[1:21:13] that strays from the shepherd
[1:21:16] of the sheep that is going to be eaten
[1:21:18] of the wolf.
[1:21:20] But as long as the sheep is in the
[1:21:22] presence of the shepherd,
[1:21:25] the sheep is safe
[1:21:29] and it is not lost.
[1:21:31] You know when Jesus was talking about
[1:21:33] the lost sheep,
[1:21:36] he was talking about a sheep
[1:21:38] that has strayed from the shepherd.
[1:21:42] Praise the name of the Lord. And a right
[1:21:44] sheep will always want to follow the
[1:21:47] shepherd.
[1:21:49] Because in the presence of the shepherd,
[1:21:52] that's where my protection is.
[1:21:55] The one that David decides,
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; I will not want.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So, let's
[1:22:02] just get back
[1:22:04] to this man here. Let's pick up in the
[1:22:07] message the prodical son.
[1:22:12] He says in paragraph 16,
[1:22:16] "And he would find have filled his belly
[1:22:19] with the the swine did it eat
[1:22:25] and no man gave unto him.
[1:22:28] Why he made a wrong decision?
[1:22:34] He didn't think on his way.
[1:22:37] He stried from the shepherd.
[1:22:40] destroyed from the father
[1:22:43] and all the protection,
[1:22:46] all the providence,
[1:22:49] all the blessing
[1:22:51] were cut off.
[1:22:53] A sheep in the wilderness.
[1:22:57] Praise the name of the Lord. And then
[1:22:59] you begin to say, I don't need a
[1:23:02] shepherd. We have had them.
[1:23:06] You go on YouTube,
[1:23:08] you feed whatever you find.
[1:23:11] You just eat enough.
[1:23:16] You just eat enough
[1:23:20] to make you jump around
[1:23:23] because you don't you you don't know the
[1:23:25] voice of the shepherd.
[1:23:30] Praise the name of the Lord. Not
[1:23:32] everyone can be a shepherd.
[1:23:36] the one
[1:23:41] to hearken to that sorry
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; to hearken to that shepherd
[1:23:47] to
[1:23:51] you see in the message uh the voice of
[1:23:53] God in the last in the last in the last
[1:23:55] days
[1:23:59] the prophet speaks about many voices
[1:24:03] and he says there is is a voice of
[1:24:05] politics.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; It is a voice, you know, of of Hollywood
[1:24:12] until people are inspired and, you know,
[1:24:14] led of of of the movies and the songs
[1:24:16] they watch
[1:24:22] and they want to act like that.
[1:24:26] And now spiritually
[1:24:29] we have very many voices
[1:24:34] and many doctrines
[1:24:36] and many teachings
[1:24:38] this message here many many many many
[1:24:44] praise the name of the Lord. But you'll
[1:24:47] find one day you find a certain brother
[1:24:50] trying starting to to to to jump around
[1:24:53] to to to act in a funny way.
[1:25:00] You wonder what's happening to him.
[1:25:03] The problem destroyed from the shepherd
[1:25:08] and he just ate enough local weed.
[1:25:13] Praise the name of the Lord. He spies
[1:25:17] stay with the shepher the Lord has given
[1:25:18] you.
[1:25:21] He continues here and says
[1:25:23] he says I can hear he I can hear them
[1:25:26] pray and get up.
[1:25:30] He's talking about the mother. The
[1:25:33] parent of this of this young man. He
[1:25:35] says I can hear them pray and he get up.
[1:25:39] father tried to hug him
[1:25:42] and he would turn his head and put his
[1:25:45] arms around him
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; and cries, "Oh, you go off
[1:25:53] on off and start go off going over the
[1:25:57] hill. I can see father and mother
[1:26:00] standing
[1:26:08] and their hands arms their hands arms
[1:26:11] round around one another
[1:26:14] waving goodbye to him
[1:26:18] as he went off over the hill
[1:26:21] down into the city to be with the rest
[1:26:23] of the world.
[1:26:26] parent.
[1:26:28] I and I can them return back into the
[1:26:32] house again weeping, crying and praying.
[1:26:38] I see him get get with big crowds down
[1:26:41] there.
[1:26:44] And as long as his money lasted,
[1:26:49] he was a good fellow.
[1:26:51] That's the way the world treats you.
[1:26:55] As long as you got money,
[1:26:58] you got friends.
[1:27:00] But when your money is gone,
[1:27:03] your friends are gone.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; That's dry weather friends.
[1:27:10] Praise the name of the Lord. And he
[1:27:12] says, I know friend who will stick by
[1:27:14] you.
[1:27:17] If you haven't got a penny, Jesus
[1:27:20] Christ, the son of God,
[1:27:22] I've been to a place where I had not a
[1:27:25] scent.
[1:27:28] He loved me.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; He loved me just as much as I wouldn't
[1:27:32] have a penny as I had a million dollars.
[1:27:38] He loves me just the same.
[1:27:41] pure, holy, unadulterated love
[1:27:47] into his people. That's the way we
[1:27:50] should love one another with that godly
[1:27:52] love.
[1:27:56] And then he gets back to the prodical
[1:27:57] son and notice I can see him as a great
[1:28:02] as a great in the places and gambling
[1:28:04] devices and holes of illame.
[1:28:12] And after a while, his money was gone
[1:28:16] and his friends was gone.
[1:28:19] He was a popular boy.
[1:28:23] He would have had a date with any of the
[1:28:25] girls.
[1:28:28] But when his money was gone,
[1:28:32] with the crowd,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; that's just the way the devil
[1:28:39] As long as you've got money
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; and popular.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; All right. But when that time we out,
[1:28:49] you are finished. And I can see him. He
[1:28:53] had to get himself a job.
[1:28:58] So he went to a citizen of the country.
[1:29:04] Look where he dropped from.
[1:29:07] A Jew not even supposed to put their
[1:29:10] hands on a hog
[1:29:15] and he was in need.
[1:29:18] He was starving
[1:29:20] and he had to take a job.
[1:29:24] Praise the name of the Lord. You know
[1:29:25] the prophet is telling us
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; that he went so deep that he did even
[1:29:31] what a Jew cannot dare.
[1:29:38] He says a Jew is not supposed to put
[1:29:41] their hand on the car of a
[1:29:47] but this man here because he was in need
[1:29:52] starving
[1:29:54] and he had strayed away from the
[1:29:56] protection of the father.
[1:29:59] He had to look for something to survive
[1:30:03] and they give him the worst thing.
[1:30:06] That's the way the devil does. Just as
[1:30:09] soon as he can get you started down the
[1:30:11] hill,
[1:30:14] he will fight you with everything he's
[1:30:17] got.
[1:30:20] He joined himself with a citizen of the
[1:30:22] country
[1:30:24] and a citizen give him two big slop
[1:30:26] buckets to get to go to to go slope the
[1:30:30] hogs.
[1:30:35] And then he say, "Think of a place
[1:30:38] whose boy out there sloping hogs in the
[1:30:41] pig pen.
[1:30:46] Think of whose boy sloping down there.
[1:30:52] A boy whose father is a king."
[1:30:57] Praise the name of the Lord. And he says
[1:31:00] away from mother,
[1:31:02] away from the religion
[1:31:04] that he once had
[1:31:06] to keep away from the hogs,
[1:31:10] now he was rotting out.
[1:31:13] That's the way the devil will do.
[1:31:16] He'll get you smoke your first
[1:31:18] cigarette.
[1:31:21] There's no harm in it
[1:31:24] and after a while you are a cigarette
[1:31:26] find.
[1:31:29] I tell you there is no harm in taking a
[1:31:31] sociable drink.
[1:31:37] I've stood by them before they went to
[1:31:40] girls.
[1:31:42] Stood by them before they was
[1:31:44] electroshooted
[1:31:47] to be a gambler.
[1:31:49] I never intended
[1:31:52] when I was playing cards to be a
[1:31:53] gambler.
[1:31:55] I never intended to. You know, he says
[1:31:58] that's what some of those people say.
[1:32:01] They never intend to do those things
[1:32:02] that they they do.
[1:32:06] Praise the name of the Lord. He says, "I
[1:32:09] never intended to bottle out of a
[1:32:12] fueling station.
[1:32:14] I didn't intend to be a thief. But only
[1:32:17] thing the devil wants you to do is to
[1:32:19] start
[1:32:22] and he will take you on.
[1:32:24] get over on his ground one time and
[1:32:27] watch watch him.
[1:32:31] You know what it means to do wrong, but
[1:32:35] there is an influence of the power of
[1:32:37] darkness.
[1:32:40] The prince of the power of the air that
[1:32:42] leads you trapped into these things.
[1:32:48] You've got to stand up, separate
[1:32:50] yourself from the things of the world,
[1:32:52] come out and live for Christ.
[1:32:57] Praise the name of the Lord. That's what
[1:33:00] the devil does. He wants you to get
[1:33:02] started.
[1:33:05] And sometimes one person will influence
[1:33:07] you into those kind of wrong things
[1:33:11] kind of wrong habits.
[1:33:14] And it will begin as you know as the
[1:33:15] prophet has told us as one you know
[1:33:18] maybe
[1:33:23] just miss once you know you just miss
[1:33:25] one Sunday or Wednesday
[1:33:30] and it becomes a pattern
[1:33:34] you just give him an inch
[1:33:37] and he'll take the whole seat that's
[1:33:40] what the devil does and that's why we
[1:33:43] need to think on hours
[1:33:45] every bit of our lives.
[1:33:49] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:33:51] So this young man, a time came where he
[1:33:56] came to himself and coming to himself.
[1:34:00] It took a thorough such
[1:34:04] it took a thorough self-examination.
[1:34:09] It took a thorough, you know, thinking
[1:34:11] on his ways.
[1:34:14] And in Luke 15:E1 17
[1:34:17] the scripture says and when he came to
[1:34:19] him
[1:34:21] he said how many hired servants of my
[1:34:23] fathers have bread enough to to eat and
[1:34:26] spare
[1:34:35] and I perish in hunger. In verse 18, he
[1:34:38] says, "I will now arise and go to my
[1:34:41] father and will say unto him, Father, I
[1:34:44] have sinned against heaven and before
[1:34:46] thee.
[1:34:57] So we see this young man. The scripture
[1:35:00] says when he came to himself
[1:35:04] that always comes
[1:35:07] after thinking
[1:35:10] that time you take
[1:35:13] and you shut in with God.
[1:35:16] Not listening to what another person is
[1:35:18] saying
[1:35:20] but listen what God is saying.
[1:35:25] That is a time
[1:35:27] When you look at the things you've done,
[1:35:31] you look at your history,
[1:35:33] you look at your past,
[1:35:35] and you see how to walk right,
[1:35:40] you see why you need to begin fasting.
[1:35:45] You see why you need to revive your
[1:35:46] prayer life.
[1:35:49] You see why you need every other day.
[1:35:54] You see why it is important to listen to
[1:35:56] that broadcast in the morning
[1:36:02] because that when you stray away
[1:36:06] the devil gets you deeper into the wrong
[1:36:08] things.
[1:36:11] Praise the name of the Lord. Every
[1:36:13] evening we ought to do so such
[1:36:18] we need to think about our day.
[1:36:22] the things that transpired through the
[1:36:24] day.
[1:36:26] If at school we are taught
[1:36:29] that to be successful
[1:36:34] in these kind of things
[1:36:37] you must you know do a selfexamination
[1:36:40] every day.
[1:36:44] If you are you know a personal executive
[1:36:48] maybe we whatever job you do
[1:36:52] you look at you know the things that you
[1:36:55] did
[1:36:57] how best you can do it
[1:37:00] where you failed
[1:37:03] what are the things that led you to
[1:37:04] failing
[1:37:06] and how can you overcome them
[1:37:09] that's the same thing that we need to do
[1:37:13] our spiritual life.
[1:37:15] Praise the name of the Lord. Because if
[1:37:17] you are to better in anything,
[1:37:21] you must give it time and you must think
[1:37:24] about it
[1:37:26] almost all time. Praise the name of the
[1:37:29] Lord. This young man, we can see him
[1:37:34] in a in a in in a peg pit,
[1:37:38] you know, he's just there. He's feeding
[1:37:40] the pigs. And then he begin to think
[1:37:43] about something.
[1:37:45] He says, "But how did this journey
[1:37:46] begin?
[1:37:49] How did I get here?"
[1:37:51] In the name of the Lord, how did I begin
[1:37:54] to smoke?
[1:37:56] How did I begin to, you know, to to to
[1:37:58] go the disco?
[1:38:01] How did I begin to do these things?
[1:38:04] And then you begin, you know, you know,
[1:38:06] tracking backwards.
[1:38:09] So it began with a desire of money
[1:38:14] came to me and told me that we can give
[1:38:16] you 30 pieces of silver to give us
[1:38:18] Jesus.
[1:38:22] It began with a desire to walk with
[1:38:24] these men here.
[1:38:27] with a desire to do this
[1:38:30] and I must clog that channel
[1:38:34] because once that channel is open
[1:38:38] channel will be clogged.
[1:38:42] Praise the name of the lord. So this
[1:38:44] young man goes on to thinking
[1:38:47] answer is but see where I am
[1:38:50] in my father's house there are many
[1:38:52] servants
[1:38:54] like me why am I living this way why am
[1:38:58] I doing these things here praise the
[1:39:01] name of the lord and he looked at all
[1:39:03] the friends that inspired him to go
[1:39:07] and they had deserted him
[1:39:10] because they were just you know those
[1:39:12] opportunist
[1:39:16] All the people that he looked at as he
[1:39:20] was going down there, they didn't have
[1:39:23] life in them.
[1:39:25] Praise the name of the Lord. So the
[1:39:27] young man thinks on his way
[1:39:29] and he says this morning
[1:39:32] and I go back to the house of my father
[1:39:36] because I know my father is merciful
[1:39:39] enough to forgive me.
[1:39:41] I know my father is gracious enough. I
[1:39:45] know my father. If at all he doesn't
[1:39:47] treat the servants the way I'm treated
[1:39:49] here,
[1:39:53] praise the name of the Lord. As you
[1:39:55] know, the prophet tells us the scripture
[1:39:58] speaks and says
[1:40:00] we are sons and daughters.
[1:40:03] We have never applied to be that
[1:40:06] the son is always a son in the house of
[1:40:08] the father.
[1:40:11] It doesn't matter where the son has
[1:40:12] gone.
[1:40:14] It doesn't matter how far the son has
[1:40:16] deviated or stride
[1:40:20] the son because he is born
[1:40:24] has no he has not just joined.
[1:40:29] Whoever the son has done,
[1:40:32] what the father waits for the son to
[1:40:35] come to himself,
[1:40:38] recognize his mistakes,
[1:40:41] the son to recognize where he failed
[1:40:43] from.
[1:40:46] Come back to the father
[1:40:48] and say, "Father, forgive me."
[1:40:51] And that's what Peter did. We shouldn't
[1:40:54] stand like Judah.
[1:40:57] Praise the name of the Lord. and take
[1:40:59] away grace for others.
[1:41:02] John never saw grace for himself.
[1:41:06] But Peter
[1:41:07] looked up and said, "He's able to
[1:41:10] forgive me.
[1:41:12] Cried out
[1:41:16] because he saw his sin.
[1:41:19] He saw his mistake. He saw where he had
[1:41:22] fallen from
[1:41:24] thinking on his way.
[1:41:27] I want to inquire.
[1:41:29] I want to to to to to YOU KNOW TO INVITE
[1:41:32] you
[1:41:34] to think on your words.
[1:41:37] And I don't know how far you've gone. I
[1:41:39] don't know what is going on in your
[1:41:40] life, but I know one thing that God, his
[1:41:45] arms
[1:41:47] of grace are open wide. Whosoever
[1:41:52] that thinkketh out
[1:41:55] and and sees that he desires to come
[1:41:57] back,
[1:42:00] he's ready to welcome you.
[1:42:02] Praise the name of the Lord. The prophet
[1:42:05] says here like the prodigal son when he
[1:42:09] was in the pig pen,
[1:42:11] he came to himself. He begin to think on
[1:42:15] his wise the way he he he would he would
[1:42:20] have been treated in his father.
[1:42:23] You know the way he had treated his
[1:42:27] father
[1:42:29] and the way he had treated others
[1:42:32] he came to himself
[1:42:35] and as he thought on his ways he said I
[1:42:38] will arise and go to my father.
[1:42:42] say I'm not worthy to be your child.
[1:42:45] Make me one of your hide servants.
[1:42:48] As he thought on his ways, we turn
[1:42:51] towards the father's house.
[1:42:56] And he says in another place,
[1:42:58] thinking of my father
[1:43:01] that has all the wealth that he has and
[1:43:03] all things that he has given to me.
[1:43:08] Here I am lying here
[1:43:12] of hunger lying in a hog pit.
[1:43:18] The Bible said he came to himself
[1:43:23] and that's what the church needs today
[1:43:27] is come to themselves.
[1:43:29] Realize who is your father.
[1:43:33] Sometimes we act as though we have no
[1:43:35] heavenly father.
[1:43:38] The goodness of heaven belongs to the
[1:43:40] church.
[1:43:42] Divine healing,
[1:43:44] separation,
[1:43:46] freedom from worry or anything
[1:43:50] all belongs to the church. Jesus died
[1:43:53] and we inherit all that God has through
[1:43:56] him.
[1:43:59] We are of the kingdom.
[1:44:02] My father is rich in houses and lands.
[1:44:05] He holds the wealth of this world in his
[1:44:08] hands.
[1:44:10] That's how we are. We just come to
[1:44:13] ourselves. Oh, I can see him as he began
[1:44:17] to come to himself
[1:44:20] and say, "Oh, I could just go home.
[1:44:23] I have sinned and I'm normal. I'm not
[1:44:26] worthy to go home. So, what can I do?"
[1:44:29] Praise the name of the Lord. And when
[1:44:31] the younger man come to the father,
[1:44:34] what was the response of the father?
[1:44:37] Praise the name of the lord. The father
[1:44:40] just saw him from a far off
[1:44:43] and he couldn't sit in the throne.
[1:44:46] He came out of the throne. He saw his
[1:44:48] father
[1:44:52] that was counted as dead.
[1:44:57] The father could not withhold himself.
[1:45:00] Praise the name of the Lord. The
[1:45:03] scripture says here,
[1:45:06] let me just get it here.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; He says in verse 19, verse 20, "And he
[1:45:14] arose and came to his father.
[1:45:16] He was yet a a great far.
[1:45:21] His father saw him and had compassion.
[1:45:26] Then he fell on his neck and he kissed
[1:45:29] him. THAT'S THE FATHER we have.
[1:45:33] Are you coming after doing a soul
[1:45:36] searching after doing a self examination
[1:45:41] on your journey back home
[1:45:46] for me father
[1:45:48] forgive me? The father runs
[1:45:52] and he begins to kiss you.
[1:45:54] And he says in verse 21
[1:45:58] to him, "Father, I have sinned against
[1:46:00] heaven and thy sight and I'm no more
[1:46:04] worth it to be called thy son." But the
[1:46:06] father said to him,
[1:46:09] "Bring forth the best robe and put it on
[1:46:12] him and put a ring on his hand and the
[1:46:16] on his feet." What is that? The father
[1:46:20] was restoring the foreign estate of his
[1:46:23] son.
[1:46:26] The father was not seeing him. The state
[1:46:29] that he was coming with.
[1:46:32] The son was coming as a foreign son. The
[1:46:36] father was looking at him as his son
[1:46:39] that has been his son from the
[1:46:41] beginning.
[1:46:42] That's how God sees us. kept looking at
[1:46:46] you and judge you in your sins and your
[1:46:48] trespasses.
[1:46:50] You are the son that was him before the
[1:46:52] beginning.
[1:46:54] Even when you coming back
[1:46:56] seeing his perfect son,
[1:47:00] he open his arms.
[1:47:03] My son always been my son. Nothing can
[1:47:07] change that.
[1:47:09] the name of the Lord. His father,
[1:47:14] the glory of his son,
[1:47:19] praise the name of the Lord and he
[1:47:21] begins, you know, to to to to dress him.
[1:47:25] As scripture says, the bride has made
[1:47:28] herself ready
[1:47:31] put on the righteousness of the Lord
[1:47:34] begins with dress with his
[1:47:37] righteousness.
[1:47:38] And the next thing here the scripture
[1:47:41] says
[1:47:44] and bring hither.
[1:47:48] You know in verse 22,
[1:47:51] BUT THE FATHER said to his son,
[1:47:54] "Bring forth the best robe
[1:47:59] and put a ring on his hand
[1:48:04] on his feet."
[1:48:07] You see, and a ring
[1:48:10] was a seal,
[1:48:13] giving him back his authority.
[1:48:19] all that he had.
[1:48:21] Why? Because he had done
[1:48:25] and saw such
[1:48:27] and he recognized
[1:48:29] all his shortcomings
[1:48:34] and he came back.
[1:48:36] Praise the name of the Lord. So in life,
[1:48:40] it doesn't matter how far you've gone
[1:48:43] as long as you can recognize
[1:48:47] your state
[1:48:49] and know that you are son of God and
[1:48:53] come back. That's what God wants.
[1:48:56] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; He just wants you to come back
[1:49:02] and as long as you can come back,
[1:49:05] then the devil has lost it.
[1:49:08] Praise the name of the Lord. So he
[1:49:10] restores the ring,
[1:49:12] gives the shoes
[1:49:15] and the best robe there was.
[1:49:18] And he says, "Bring he the fatted calf,
[1:49:22] give it, and let us eat and Mary for
[1:49:27] this my son."
[1:49:30] He's not saying this was my son.
[1:49:34] He says this
[1:49:36] my son.
[1:49:38] Now,
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; praise the name of the Lord. He was
[1:49:42] dead,
[1:49:45] you see, and is alive again.
[1:49:48] What is making him alive again?
[1:49:56] Made him dead.
[1:50:00] Recognizing himself
[1:50:03] and coming back
[1:50:05] makes him alive again.
[1:50:08] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; So he says he's alive again.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; He was lost.
[1:50:14] What makes the sheep lost
[1:50:18] from the presence of the shepherd?
[1:50:21] But as long as it can see the shepherd,
[1:50:25] it is not lost.
[1:50:28] So he says it was lost.
[1:50:30] He was lost but is found.
[1:50:34] And the scripture says, "And they began
[1:50:38] to Mary.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; The man recognized
[1:50:46] who he was.
[1:50:49] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:50:52] He says in the prodical son,
[1:50:56] he says, I can hear him say,
[1:51:00] "Oh father, I am not worthy to be your
[1:51:03] son."
[1:51:05] maybe one of your hired servants,
[1:51:09] but I'll go on the father and mother
[1:51:12] down to the gates.
[1:51:14] They went
[1:51:16] no matter what he had done.
[1:51:20] He's coming home now.
[1:51:23] Run, threw their arms around him
[1:51:27] and said, "Go kill the fed.
[1:51:31] Let's make Mary. This my son that was
[1:51:34] dead
[1:51:35] is alive again. He was lost and now he's
[1:51:39] found. Put a ring on his finger,
[1:51:43] shoes on his feet. Put the best robe you
[1:51:47] got in the house on him.
[1:51:50] And then he says, "That's the attitude
[1:51:53] of the father
[1:51:56] to every sinner
[1:51:58] in here that staggered.
[1:52:00] I remember when I was lost
[1:52:03] and undone,
[1:52:07] dying,
[1:52:09] a sinner,
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; laying on a hospital bed,
[1:52:13] the doctor said, "I had just a few
[1:52:16] moments to live,
[1:52:19] but I cried,
[1:52:21] turned down the road, and as a child, I
[1:52:25] ran to meet the heavenly father.
[1:52:28] He kissed me on the neck.
[1:52:31] Kissed away all my sins and cares.
[1:52:35] Put the robe the Holy Spirit on me.
[1:52:39] Put the wedding ring on my finger.
[1:52:43] And I'm going somewhere one of these
[1:52:45] days.
[1:52:47] Put me in his people here where we can
[1:52:50] rejoice
[1:52:52] and live together and be happy. Why? I
[1:52:57] was once dead,
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; now I am alive.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; I was once lost,
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; now I'm found.
[1:53:07] There is many prodigals in the world
[1:53:09] today.
[1:53:12] There is prodigal men,
[1:53:15] prodigal women, and God calls for all to
[1:53:18] come repent.
[1:53:20] Is that right? He wants us to come.
[1:53:25] He wants you, all prodigals
[1:53:29] everywhere.
[1:53:30] Praise the name of the Lord. God wants
[1:53:34] us to come back to him.
[1:53:36] Amen.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Let's like there.
[1:53:49] Just want us to sing one song.
[1:53:52] There's a song I love so much.
[1:53:56] I believe I've sung it here.
[1:54:01] The song How Deep The Father's Love.
[1:54:08] You see, the Father
[1:54:10] is always waiting for us back home.
[1:54:15] You know
[1:54:18] it's very important
[1:54:21] to note that the most important thing in
[1:54:23] life
[1:54:26] is recognizing your stature
[1:54:31] your status
[1:54:35] of God
[1:54:37] where you're standing.
[1:54:39] And then the other thing is recognizing
[1:54:42] that you a son
[1:54:46] in the kingdom of God.
[1:54:49] Those two things
[1:54:51] are the things that keeps us alive
[1:54:55] in the kingdom of God.
[1:55:00] Amen.
[1:55:03] How deep the father.
[1:55:09] Oh,
[1:55:11] how was beyond all measure.
[1:55:19] What he should give his
[1:55:24] only son
[1:55:28] to make our riches.
[1:55:33] Amen.
[1:55:35] Oh,
[1:55:37] how great the pain.
[1:55:46] The father
[1:55:48] turns his face
[1:55:52] away
[1:55:55] as
[1:55:57] which mother
[1:55:59] chose him.
[1:56:02] Glor.
[1:56:21] Hallelujah.

[1:56:42] Oh
[1:56:45] man.
[1:56:52] It was my sin that held it.
[1:56:59] Hallelujah.
[1:57:03] It was a

[1:57:11] I died.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:20] I know
[1:57:23] that it is.
[1:57:28] Amen.
[1:57:30] I will not go steal.
[1:57:59] is
[1:58:02] our
[1:58:07] man.
[1:58:09] My should I go from here?
[1:58:17] Oh, I can not give my
[1:58:25] son.
[1:58:35] Hallelujah.
[1:58:40] I'll be my
[1:58:44] Let's just repeat that second verse.
[1:58:47] Oh, beholder.

[1:58:58] I see
[1:59:02] his

[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:08] I sh
[1:59:11] my broken
[1:59:15] love your father.
[1:59:27] It was my sin that
[1:59:33] all that my soul was sing
[1:59:39] it was a
[1:59:42] hallelujah.
[1:59:51] You might be here
[1:59:54] and you have done yourself examination.

[2:00:03] Hallelujah.
[2:00:07] Just thinking on our eyes.
[2:00:12] Just think about your today.
[2:00:15] Think about your yesterday.
[2:00:18] Think about how you've been walking.
[2:00:25] It's our time to run quickly to the
[2:00:28] master.
[2:00:34] Our sins held him there.
[2:00:39] Hallelujah.
[2:00:41] Father, we love you.

[2:01:22] you devised a way for mankind to come
[2:01:24] back to you.

[2:01:31] door isn't closed yet,
