[36:53] pray. Amen. Let us Psalms 95.
[37:00] We're reading from verse one to verse
[37:04] 7. The Bible
[37:06] says, "Oh come, let us sing unto the
[37:10] Lord. Let us make a joyful noise to the
[37:12] rock of our salvation.
[37:23] Let us come before his presence with
[37:26] thanksgiving and make a joyful noise
[37:29] unto him with
[37:37] psalms. For the Lord is a great God and
[37:40] a great king above all gods.
[37:49] In his hands are the deep places of the
[37:51] earth. The strength of the hills is his
[38:01] also. The sea is his and he made it and
[38:06] his hands formed the dry land.
[38:16] Oh come, let us worship and bow down.
[38:19] Let us kneel before the Lord our
[38:29] maker. For he is our God and we are the
[38:32] people of his pasture and the sheep of
[38:35] his hand. Today if you hear his voice,
[38:49] May God blessing of his words. You may
[38:51] be seated. So I want to share on
[38:54] worshiping
[38:56] God. I had a lot of notes written
[39:01] here but I know we can't finish it
[39:05] today. Praise the name of our Lord.
[39:08] We shall take another
[39:10] service I believe in the after next
[39:13] weekend or in the course of the
[39:16] time so that we can continue
[39:20] on. So worshiping
[39:23] God. Praise the name of our
[39:26] Lord. You know people like being
[39:28] woripped.
[39:31] people like, you know, being
[39:36] honored or
[39:39] praised, you know, and God made us to
[39:42] worship
[39:44] him, he made the angels to worship
[39:47] him. Like last time we read in Isaiah
[39:50] chapter
[39:52] 6 whereby these
[39:55] saraphim all the
[39:57] time they are singing holy, holy,
[40:03] holy, praise the name of the Bible says
[40:07] two wings they cover their
[40:09] eyes two wings they cover their feet and
[40:13] two wings they
[40:15] fly. Praise the name of our Lord. God
[40:18] loves to be
[40:20] worshiped. Praise the name of our Lord.
[40:22] And also when we come to church, we come
[40:26] to
[40:28] worship. That's the reason we come to
[40:30] church and we can
[40:33] worship. But then even the time we are
[40:36] here at
[40:37] church, you know when you speak to God,
[40:41] you also need to keep
[40:43] quiet. You also need to be calm.
[40:46] And then you he speaks to you
[40:49] also. Praise the name of Lord so that
[40:52] you also hear what he is saying to
[40:56] me. Praise the name of our Lord. And so
[40:58] now the first thing that we do when we
[41:00] come to
[41:02] church. You wait on the
[41:05] Lord. You
[41:07] pray
[41:09] silently. Meditating upon his word.
[41:13] meditating upon his goodness.
[41:16] I know at that
[41:18] time music is played
[41:21] silently you know you know kind of like
[41:24] instrumental
[41:26] music you know just only
[41:29] instruments silent
[41:31] music godly music but you're also busy
[41:37] interceding Lord be gracious to me Lord
[41:40] forgive me here Lord I've come into your
[41:43] presence you know your heart opening up
[41:46] to the
[41:47] Lord. And so when we come to the church,
[41:51] we need to come with our hearts ready to
[41:55] worship. Your heart truly truly
[41:58] connected to
[42:00] God and not so much mindful about the
[42:03] environment around
[42:05] you. Oh, who has not yet come? Who is
[42:08] that coming? Who has done this? you know
[42:12] your
[42:13] mind, your
[42:16] consecration unto the Lord. Praise the
[42:19] name of Lord. And now when the service
[42:22] starts, certainly the song leader starts
[42:25] with the
[42:26] song. And now this has always been in
[42:29] the
[42:30] scriptures and we can go and pick in the
[42:34] scriptures about the song
[42:37] services. Today we may dwell more on the
[42:39] song service.
[42:42] And then the other portion we shall end
[42:44] with it another
[42:46] day. Praise the name of our Lord. So now
[42:50] let us go to 1 Coronicles chapter
[42:55] 6. 1 Coronicles chapter
[42:59] 6 and then verse
[43:05] 31. So the Bible says
[43:13] And these are they whom David set over
[43:15] the services over the service of song in
[43:18] the house of the Lord. After that the
[43:20] ark had rested.
[43:35] I think you read it again.
[43:53] And they ministered before the dwelling
[43:55] place of the tabernacle of the
[43:57] congregation with singing until Solomon
[44:01] had built the house of the Lord in
[44:04] Jerusalem. And then they waited on their
[44:07] office according to their order.
[44:33] So song service is a
[44:37] ministry. Praise the name of our Lord.
[44:40] So then the Bible says David sent over
[44:46] some to lead in the song
[44:51] service. Praise the name of our Lord.
[44:53] And here we thank God. He has blessed us
[44:56] with brother
[44:57] Moses, brother Joshua,
[45:01] brother. Praise the name of our Lord.
[45:04] But you know they are also to wait on
[45:06] their ministry.
[45:10] Praise the name of our God. They have to
[45:12] wait on the
[45:14] Lord. Lord, there is a service I'm going
[45:18] through. What song should I
[45:21] sing? Because you know God has to take
[45:25] the preeminence upon the entire
[45:28] service. So even as when we are coming
[45:30] in the
[45:32] church, we need to come when we are
[45:34] prayed up.
[45:36] Sometimes you've gone through the week
[45:37] with a lot of
[45:40] troubles. You have a lot of
[45:42] burdens. You have a lot of
[45:45] distresses, a lot of sorrows. So you
[45:48] pray, "Lord, help
[45:50] me. As I go into your
[45:53] service, deliver me from these things
[45:55] that have been troubling me through
[45:57] this." So now when you enter the church,
[46:01] let your mind not be at home.
[46:04] Let your mind not be at your place of
[46:06] God. Let your mind not be with your
[46:09] family. Let your mind not be about
[46:12] tomorrow. Let your mind be on
[46:15] God. And that's how you can benefit in
[46:18] the
[46:20] service. So as as children of God, we
[46:24] need to come when we are prayed
[46:26] up. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[46:29] when we have come when we have prayed up
[46:32] then follow the leadership of the Holy
[46:35] Spirit which the Lord is guiding
[46:38] us. Like if the song leader comes
[46:41] in let us clap
[46:44] our why don't you clap your hands. If
[46:47] the song leader comes here and says let
[46:49] us stand up then why don't we stand up?
[46:53] If the song reader comes here says let
[46:55] us sing this
[46:56] song. You know there are some people who
[47:00] just look at the
[47:02] screen and then keep quiet and then they
[47:05] are singing but I don't know whether
[47:08] they somebody would hear what they are
[47:10] singing just the mouth is opening so
[47:14] small and I know this person is not
[47:16] interested in what we are
[47:18] doing. You don't come like that. Come
[47:22] willing to be led by the
[47:25] spirit. Praise the name of You know, you
[47:28] can see somebody who is
[47:31] troubled. The mind is
[47:34] far, but he's not in the spirit of the
[47:38] service. But then when we come, we come
[47:41] to
[47:42] worship. And when you come to worship,
[47:45] come with a joyful
[47:47] heart. Praise the name of our Lord. Come
[47:50] with a joyful
[47:51] heart. Express your
[47:54] gratitude. you know, express your
[47:57] happiness. Praise the name of our Lord.
[48:00] You know, we have so many things to
[48:01] thank the Lord
[48:03] for. You're not in
[48:05] hospital. Why don't you thank God that
[48:08] you're not being
[48:10] buried? Why don't you thank God that you
[48:12] are still
[48:14] alive? You know, you have ability to
[48:17] come. Why don't you thank God? Even if
[48:21] you slept hungry last
[48:23] night, you have reason to thank God.
[48:27] Lord, I thank
[48:28] you. Lord, I thank you for the gift of
[48:31] life. Even if you have walked from
[48:33] home, Lord, I thank
[48:36] you. Praise the name of our Lord. Even
[48:38] if you have
[48:40] walked maybe, but these days you hardly
[48:42] get people without
[48:45] shoes. Those days there were many
[48:49] barefoot. But you thank God. Lord, I
[48:52] thank you. I'm here in the
[48:54] services. So you join with a free
[48:58] heart. You join into the services of the
[49:02] Lord. And as the song leader steps
[49:05] here, be obedient to the leadership of
[49:09] the be part of that
[49:11] service. Praise the name of our Lord.
[49:13] This is what we are meant to do.
[49:16] You don't come in the church and be an
[49:21] observer. This lifting up hands for you
[49:24] are
[49:27] folding. Be
[49:30] participating. Praise the name of the
[49:32] Lord. There's actually a scripture
[49:35] here in the book of Psalms chapter 28:2.
[49:42] The Bible says, says, "Hear the voice of
[49:45] my
[49:46] supplication when I cry unto thee, when
[49:50] I lift up my hand toward thy holy
[49:55] oracle." Psalms 28:E2
[50:13] So lifting up your hand is part of
[50:17] worship. Praise the name of Lord. You
[50:20] lift up your
[50:21] hand. You stand up. You clap your hand.
[50:26] Say hallelujah. Lord, I thank
[50:28] you. Praise the name of you know you
[50:31] raise up.
[50:36] 1 Timothy 2:8
[50:54] Praise the name of the Lord. He says,
[50:56] "Lifting up holy
[50:58] hands, have the liberty to raise your
[51:00] hand." And then you know you are
[51:02] worshiping God. Lord, I thank you for
[51:05] this. Lord, I thank for what you have
[51:08] done. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[51:10] need to see that you get into the spirit
[51:12] of
[51:13] worship. And you know you don't just be
[51:16] there until the song
[51:19] leader the service is too heavy for
[51:23] him. Praise the name of Lord. You know
[51:26] when you go to
[51:29] introduction this is speakers or spokes
[51:34] spokespersons one will
[51:41] say in other words they don't care what
[51:44] you talk to them we shouldn't be like
[51:47] that when we come into the
[51:51] service you've come into the presence of
[51:54] God express it with joy Lord, express it
[51:58] with happiness. Lord, I'm here. Lord,
[52:01] I've come to worship you. Lord, I've
[52:04] come to praise you by lifting up your
[52:07] hands. Praise the name of our Lord by
[52:09] clapping your hands. Praise the name of
[52:12] our Lord. And then you'll find that you
[52:14] are released from some of those
[52:17] bondages. You break
[52:20] through. Praise the name of Lord. You
[52:22] know, you find yourself that the
[52:24] entanglement
[52:27] the things just keep on leaving
[52:29] you. You have the
[52:31] liberty. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[52:34] we need to see that when we come into
[52:35] the presence of
[52:37] God, we need to
[52:39] worship. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[52:42] there was always a song
[52:44] service and then here in the church
[52:47] order, a song service should be for 30
[52:51] minutes.
[52:53] It should be for 30 minutes. Should be
[52:56] for 30
[52:57] minutes. That's how the prophet guides
[53:00] us. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[53:03] then he tells
[53:04] us in this
[53:07] message in the message the unpardonable
[53:11] sin. He says now don't want to take too
[53:15] much of your
[53:17] time for I know tomorrow is
[53:20] Monday and work day and in during the
[53:24] time of the
[53:26] revival if God willing. We just want to
[53:30] find a good hour and a
[53:36] half or two hours of a night, a song
[53:41] service and then go right into the
[53:44] teaching of
[53:45] God. And I think that songs are
[53:50] marvelous, but you can ruin a meeting by
[53:55] songs. Too many of them
[53:59] See, we can sing, but what the house of
[54:04] God
[54:06] is is for
[54:08] correction, for the word, for
[54:12] understanding, for
[54:13] instruction that we know how to behave
[54:19] ourselves. And I think you got
[54:21] terrified. So he says too many
[54:23] songs can ruin the
[54:26] service. Now when you go to the
[54:28] denomination, especially the
[54:31] Pentecost, they can take the whole
[54:34] service
[54:37] singing and invite you the
[54:39] preacher for only 30
[54:42] minutes. But they have been singing. You
[54:45] get choirs come
[54:47] here, come with this, come with this.
[54:51] And now when they invite you to preach
[54:54] and when you are coming to preach here
[54:56] the people in the choir they get
[55:01] out they also go away. They just leave
[55:04] there just singing and
[55:09] dancing. They are missing nightclubs
[55:13] there. Satan has given them an
[55:16] alternative.
[55:19] the jazzes like it's going in the
[55:23] disco and then they also have that for
[55:26] Christ and brotherham says
[55:30] go they are crucifying Christ again
[55:34] there by their things they
[55:37] doing praise the name of our lord so you
[55:41] find for them the music industry has
[55:43] taken them
[55:47] over they Get somebody who plays
[55:50] instruments in the
[55:53] nightclub and is the one who comes and
[55:55] plays their
[55:58] music. They get such kind of people or
[56:01] even to do song
[56:04] service or even to
[56:07] lead. He's in the disco hall. Then he
[56:10] comes in the church. So he can know one
[56:13] song or two
[56:14] songs and he can also
[56:18] sing
[56:20] deception. Like I heard a
[56:23] story that there is a Ugandan who went
[56:25] to
[56:26] Congo and when he reached
[56:30] Congo because he was not
[56:32] saved but he knows maybe when I go to a
[56:34] church of saved people they will receive
[56:38] me. So he says I'm from Uganda.
[56:45] message and then saying they're all
[56:48] lifting their hands
[56:50] [Music]
[56:55] crying. Then there was a pastor who came
[56:58] from
[56:59] Uganda. He went to that same church and
[57:03] then they said, "Let us sing for him
[57:04] with the Ugandan song of worship."
[57:06] Then they started singing
[57:09] kapa, crying, lifting
[57:12] up. He was
[57:14] shocked. So when he was invited, he told
[57:18] them where did how did you learn this
[57:20] song? So there was a Ugandan who came
[57:23] and he told us this song told him this
[57:25] song means that a cat is
[57:29] chasing. Now the question is why were
[57:32] they
[57:34] crying? For what?
[57:39] And in some of this kind of rap
[57:43] music somebody goes
[57:45] goes completely sold into the
[57:49] thing. But then the Bible tells us if we
[57:53] are going to
[57:55] sing let us sing with
[57:57] understanding what I'm
[58:00] singing what does it mean? Let us go to
[58:03] the book of first Corinthians.
[58:06] Praise the name of our
[58:09] Lord. First Corinthians chapter 14:15.
[58:16] Yes. The Bible says, "What is it then? I
[58:21] will pray with the spirit and I will
[58:24] pray with understanding also." I will
[58:27] sing with the spirit and I will sing
[58:30] with understanding also.
[58:47] Praise the name of the Lord says I will
[58:49] pray in the
[58:50] spirit. I will pray with
[58:53] understanding. I will sing in the spirit
[58:56] and I will sing with understanding. And
[58:59] that should be the same thing we have
[59:00] our
[59:01] services. But when we and some of these
[59:04] secular
[59:05] musicians because they know that there
[59:07] is some gap in gospel
[59:14] music. So they kind of create their
[59:16] music.
[59:18] create for the people in the
[59:23] [Music]
[59:27] church and somebody says that is gospel
[59:33] music and then you get somebody singing
[59:36] that over
[59:39] [Music]
[59:45] you know and then somebody says this is
[59:47] gospel
[59:48] music. And then there's another common
[59:51] song which is always played in
[59:58] nurseries. What did he
[1:00:02] disco some music without
[1:00:06] conviction? Pick one
[1:00:08] word. Repeat it. Repeat it. Repeat
[1:00:13] it. Praise the name of the Lord. This is
[1:00:15] what the world is giving
[1:00:17] us. And then we are taking
[1:00:20] it now. And we find the biggest
[1:00:25] trouble when we have
[1:00:29] functions, our
[1:00:31] weddings, our
[1:00:33] introduction or our
[1:00:36] graduations,
[1:00:37] whatever. Then we bring any kind of
[1:00:40] music there.
[1:00:43] And praise the introducing
[1:00:48] and the person who was speaking the
[1:00:49] daughter of the pastor was also a
[1:00:57] believer and then they played all the
[1:01:01] secular music
[1:01:03] there and then they would have you know
[1:01:05] these girls come
[1:01:07] out. They come and do whatever they want
[1:01:09] to do.
[1:01:12] And you know people are just
[1:01:15] rejoicing. Personally I don't even
[1:01:17] record anything on
[1:01:19] that. Why would I keep that thing on my
[1:01:23] phone? Why would I feed on such a
[1:01:27] thing and then they come the way they
[1:01:29] are
[1:01:30] dressed tight things.
[1:01:37] These are the doctors and then they
[1:01:39] come funny
[1:01:42] dances funny music and we are
[1:01:46] rejoicing
[1:01:49] that because they are wrong
[1:01:51] spirits but we have them in our
[1:01:55] functions. We have them at our
[1:01:58] homes. You have the liberty to do the
[1:02:00] right
[1:02:01] thing but you're not doing it. Ah you
[1:02:05] know you know
[1:02:07] sometimes you know my
[1:02:10] relatives my
[1:02:11] [Music]
[1:02:14] brothers you know it is who ordered that
[1:02:17] song to be
[1:02:21] s praise the name of our lord and then
[1:02:24] you go in those
[1:02:26] functions they know what to
[1:02:28] do when when when young men of the
[1:02:31] family come to greet abac
[1:02:36] When the in-laws come to
[1:02:41] greet the other ones who have come to be
[1:02:45] introduced, they say that you girls
[1:02:51] attack, they give them
[1:02:54] belts. You tie him, you can tie,
[1:02:56] everyone tie one person. Those are
[1:02:58] things which are happening and then we
[1:03:00] are letting the world take us
[1:03:04] on and then you find funny things
[1:03:08] happen until one was saying when she saw
[1:03:12] the
[1:03:13] husband a woman come and put a belt
[1:03:16] around
[1:03:17] him then start dancing around themselves
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:22] rolling. The man has never danced with
[1:03:25] the wife in the public.
[1:03:28] but is dancing with a stranger in the
[1:03:31] park. And then the wife said that woman
[1:03:35] can take my
[1:03:37] husband and she was
[1:03:39] serious. But these are the things we
[1:03:41] have brought into
[1:03:44] ourselves. We've opened
[1:03:46] up that every just
[1:03:52] comes. But this is what the world has
[1:03:54] taken us on.
[1:03:57] take their
[1:03:59] music bring it in
[1:04:01] ourselves until sometimes we don't have
[1:04:04] the
[1:04:06] difference of what kind of
[1:04:09] music I should take
[1:04:11] on praise the name of our lord like
[1:04:14] now I believe it was
[1:04:19] here they started playing I think she's
[1:04:22] called chaka
[1:04:24] chaka chaka chaka It's a wedding day.
[1:04:27] It's a wedding day. We need better music
[1:04:30] than that.
[1:04:33] Praise the name of the Lord. We need
[1:04:35] better music than
[1:04:37] that. Somebody, it's a wedding
[1:04:41] day. We need better
[1:04:45] music. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:04:48] then there's also another
[1:04:50] place. Now, the brother had been
[1:04:52] introduced in the house.
[1:04:56] in the home of a believer and then they
[1:04:58] were making him to go
[1:05:00] out. There is a song they sing in
[1:05:03] Luganda.
[1:05:05] But then the way it came out and then
[1:05:07] they making him go by that
[1:05:13] song and then sometimes our when they
[1:05:16] are
[1:05:17] hosting you know their parents are
[1:05:19] holding are hosting the
[1:05:22] in-law or the
[1:05:25] son-in-law then there is a
[1:05:30] song and it is strange
[1:05:33] They know the songs even by
[1:05:36] head. He only speaks one word and then
[1:05:40] the MC knows the song or the DJ knows
[1:05:42] the song. Then they play it and then
[1:05:45] they start miming like those secular
[1:05:48] musician then going
[1:05:52] down and you know everybody it has
[1:05:55] become
[1:05:58] normal. It's just a function. No,
[1:06:02] strong. Praise the name of Lord. We need
[1:06:04] to get away from that
[1:06:07] dirt. Put it aside. Leave it with the
[1:06:10] world. For if God has blessed
[1:06:13] you that your daughter has got a
[1:06:19] fianc or your son has got a
[1:06:23] also do everything in the
[1:06:26] Lord in the fear of the
[1:06:29] Lord. Even when you are dressing the
[1:06:32] dressing should honor the
[1:06:35] Lord. Let your dress be of honor to the
[1:06:38] Lord.
[1:06:39] Why would you put on a tight
[1:06:41] thing? Why would you put on something
[1:06:43] exposing your
[1:06:46] armpits? Why would you put on
[1:06:49] something, you know, exposing your
[1:06:52] breast, your
[1:06:55] armpits? Why would you do such a thing?
[1:06:58] Why don't you take the honor of the Lord
[1:07:00] Jesus
[1:07:02] Christ? Why would you want to be like
[1:07:06] Jezebel painted up?
[1:07:09] everything
[1:07:12] like but you see the devil has taken a
[1:07:14] hold of that
[1:07:17] and then it got a hold of
[1:07:25] them you know the other ones who worked
[1:07:27] on the bride they
[1:07:29] overowered her they overpowered her and
[1:07:32] then at the end of somebody who
[1:07:35] comes there's a brother I
[1:07:41] told and I told him if we see the
[1:07:44] dressing is not
[1:07:47] right or we are not going to refuse
[1:07:50] wedding but we're not going to put
[1:07:52] anything
[1:07:54] up. We are not going to stream it at
[1:07:58] all. Clear
[1:08:02] instructions. Praise the name of the
[1:08:04] Lord. We must have an order.
[1:08:08] And the standard that we
[1:08:11] take, we don't just allow anything to
[1:08:13] come
[1:08:15] in. Now that does not
[1:08:17] mean somebody coming here in that
[1:08:22] way. We chase them out. We don't chase
[1:08:25] them
[1:08:26] out. Maybe they have come for their
[1:08:29] salvation. But if somebody is part of
[1:08:32] us and then doing something which we
[1:08:35] don't
[1:08:36] believe. So brother what you have s what
[1:08:39] you've
[1:08:40] s is not right. So next time if you are
[1:08:43] singing do better than
[1:08:46] that. Praise the name of our lord. Yes.
[1:08:49] We need to see that we
[1:08:52] maintain the presence of the spirit of
[1:08:54] God in the
[1:08:56] world. Praise the name of Now if you can
[1:08:59] do that here in public then what do you
[1:09:01] eat when you are
[1:09:07] alone and you see
[1:09:10] nowadays what I'm forgetting how they
[1:09:12] call them ears.
[1:09:14] Ear pads or what? So somebody can put
[1:09:16] them here. music is playing
[1:09:19] here, but you don't know what you're
[1:09:21] listening
[1:09:22] to. But as Christians, we need to feed
[1:09:26] on what is
[1:09:28] right. Praise the name of our Lord. If
[1:09:31] you have the Holy Spirit, the Holy
[1:09:33] Spirit will cause you to eat the right
[1:09:36] things, to desire the right things, to
[1:09:39] long for the right things, not dirty
[1:09:42] things, not the things which are famous
[1:09:45] in the
[1:09:46] world. And then we can get the things in
[1:09:48] the world and then we go by what the
[1:09:51] world is
[1:09:52] doing. It should not be like that.
[1:09:55] Praise the name of our Lord. So our song
[1:09:59] service. Praise the name of our Lord. 30
[1:10:03] minutes but then we have even more than
[1:10:05] 30
[1:10:07] minutes because we start at 9. You have
[1:10:10] now the first 30 minutes
[1:10:12] song. Then 10 to
[1:10:16] 10:30 we have the Sunday
[1:10:19] school. Then after
[1:10:21] 10:30 we have another 30
[1:10:25] minutes. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:10:27] And during these song services that's
[1:10:30] where we can have our
[1:10:32] testimonies. That's where we can have
[1:10:33] maybe our prayer
[1:10:35] requests and all those kind of different
[1:10:37] things. And then now the ministry of the
[1:10:41] word. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:10:44] we have our own
[1:10:48] songs. Let us sing our own
[1:10:52] songs. Praise the name of Lord. If we
[1:10:55] don't sing them, who will sing
[1:10:58] them? If you don't love what you
[1:11:02] have, who will take credit for it or who
[1:11:06] will praise
[1:11:07] it? If you despise what you
[1:11:15] have parents who despise their
[1:11:19] children, my child is
[1:11:22] ugly. My child is
[1:11:26] stupid. My child is a big
[1:11:31] problem. Who do you produce him for?
[1:11:35] You are despising what God has given
[1:11:38] you instead of appreciating what God has
[1:11:41] given
[1:11:43] you. Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[1:11:46] need to hear our songs
[1:11:49] sung. Praise the name of our Lord. If we
[1:11:53] have 10 songs in the song
[1:11:56] service, let us have five
[1:11:58] songs, our own
[1:12:00] songs. Praise the name of Lord. Let us
[1:12:03] learn
[1:12:05] them. Let us sing them. Not only in
[1:12:09] church, but even at home or even when
[1:12:12] you are
[1:12:13] driving, when you're listening on your
[1:12:15] phone, listen to this
[1:12:18] music because it is inspired
[1:12:22] music. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:12:25] us have our songs
[1:12:27] s. And then we can now bring in the old
[1:12:30] time songs.
[1:12:33] Praise the name of our Lord. But let us
[1:12:35] hear more of our
[1:12:38] songs. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:12:41] us learn them and sing
[1:12:44] them sometime I think this
[1:12:48] year. We had talked about distributing
[1:12:50] these songs to
[1:12:53] everybody. And then there was a sister.
[1:12:56] She's a lawyer lawyer. She came and
[1:12:59] said, "We better have the intellectual
[1:13:02] property. Let us patent our
[1:13:07] songs. Let us register them, you know,
[1:13:10] before we can put them out." She was
[1:13:13] right. Praise the name over. And then
[1:13:15] there's a brother I talked
[1:13:17] to see how those songs can be
[1:13:20] compiled. And then I called brother
[1:13:22] Emmanuel. Some years ago he was asking
[1:13:24] me about the
[1:13:26] same because being a lawyer he knows the
[1:13:30] processes but now I don't know where the
[1:13:33] problem
[1:13:34] is why the songs are not coming up all
[1:13:37] of
[1:13:38] them because we are saying now there are
[1:13:40] some songs which are
[1:13:42] missing because we wanted to collect all
[1:13:44] these
[1:13:46] songs the
[1:13:49] relics praise the name of our lord and
[1:13:51] then the rhythm
[1:13:54] such that we can have them
[1:13:57] registered with the government and even
[1:14:00] put in the
[1:14:02] gazette. This is what we want. And then
[1:14:06] now we can print out those
[1:14:09] books and then have them fully
[1:14:11] distributed. But the good thing is we
[1:14:13] have them. We can project them when we
[1:14:15] in
[1:14:16] church. We can receive the voices from
[1:14:19] you know the people have the equipment.
[1:14:23] So we need to sing our
[1:14:25] songs. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[1:14:27] need to see that our
[1:14:30] songs are sung here in the
[1:14:33] church. You know in the message
[1:14:35] questions and answers, brother Brandham
[1:14:38] says, "How many knows this old this good
[1:14:42] old
[1:14:43] song, blessed be the tide that binds."
[1:14:49] How many people here are over 40 years
[1:14:52] old? Raise your hands with me and
[1:14:56] say, I remember the old
[1:14:59] song from 40 years, blessed be the tithe
[1:15:03] that
[1:15:05] binds. Then he said, "Don't you like
[1:15:08] them old
[1:15:10] songs?" Listen, I want to say this. If
[1:15:15] we had more of those old
[1:15:20] songs instead of so much of this
[1:15:23] carrying on what we do
[1:15:27] have, I believe the church would be
[1:15:30] better
[1:15:32] off. I like those good old
[1:15:35] songs that was pinned by the Holy
[1:15:40] Spirit. Praise the name of Lord. We need
[1:15:43] also to like the songs.
[1:15:45] Praise the name of the Lord. A song that
[1:15:47] can touch your
[1:15:49] heart that can bring
[1:15:51] transformation. But now these old
[1:15:54] songs down at the cross my savior
[1:15:58] died. You know I feel like
[1:16:03] traveling. You know burdens are
[1:16:08] lifted. Leave it there. Leave it there.
[1:16:13] Praise the name of now our song
[1:16:17] leaders. Brother Moses, brother Joshua,
[1:16:23] brother in the back. I was wondering
[1:16:25] whether sometimes he sits there. So I
[1:16:28] was wondering whether he's
[1:16:30] there. There are some songs you can take
[1:16:33] a whole year in church and you've not
[1:16:34] heard
[1:16:38] it. Praise the name of Lord. Let us
[1:16:41] revisit all these
[1:16:43] songs. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:16:46] then every Sunday, why should I be
[1:16:47] singing the same
[1:16:50] song? Why? When we have hundreds of
[1:16:56] songs, you know, there are even
[1:16:58] songs that the generation which is
[1:17:02] around, they don't know
[1:17:05] them. Why have they got that song?
[1:17:09] because you're not
[1:17:13] s we need to see that we get back to
[1:17:16] this old time
[1:17:19] music and he says they were pinned down
[1:17:22] by the
[1:17:23] Holy them
[1:17:26] oldtimers I used to remember an old
[1:17:30] colored
[1:17:31] man used to set out behind the
[1:17:35] house down there in the mountains of
[1:17:39] When he would get
[1:17:41] weary, he would set an old
[1:17:47] log and he would beat his hands on the
[1:17:52] Lord. I remember him just well. He had a
[1:17:56] little rim of white hair around his
[1:18:00] head. He would sing that old
[1:18:04] song. Praise the name of the Lord. We
[1:18:07] need to get back to
[1:18:09] that. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:18:12] us not be taken by that. Let us get back
[1:18:16] to where the Holy Spirit can be happy
[1:18:20] now. Songs that are by the Holy
[1:18:23] Spirit and let us not go by popular
[1:18:27] music. You know there are some popular
[1:18:29] music in the Pentecostal
[1:18:31] world. Then we want to take the
[1:18:34] same. We have real genuine Holy
[1:18:37] Spiritfilled
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:43] music. The Holy Spirit brought them.
[1:18:45] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us get
[1:18:47] back to
[1:18:48] that even at home. Let us be singing
[1:18:52] that. And I like how brother Joshua was
[1:18:54] bringing
[1:18:57] it. English and
[1:19:00] Luganda. Let us get these old songs.
[1:19:05] Sing them also in
[1:19:07] Luganda. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:19:09] You know you are singing down at the
[1:19:12] cross. Then you can also sing it in
[1:19:20] Luganda. You know that kind of
[1:19:23] blend that somebody who may not be able
[1:19:26] to understand
[1:19:28] English can understand the meaning of
[1:19:31] the song in Uganda.
[1:19:34] Praise the name of our Lord. And not
[1:19:36] only he said, I like this
[1:19:39] song. Praise the name of Then when we
[1:19:42] had brother Joshua
[1:19:46] sing then you would see the people get
[1:19:49] excited and when I got to those areas
[1:19:53] in
[1:19:55] maybe I put on that song and then those
[1:19:58] brothers there one time when they came
[1:20:00] here and they heard that song
[1:20:03] They remember brother
[1:20:05] Joshua and then say can we sing that
[1:20:09] song praise the name of you know those
[1:20:12] people who are in trinity called baptism
[1:20:15] the song had
[1:20:17] message when somebody sits and listens
[1:20:20] to that
[1:20:21] song they will start thinking how they
[1:20:23] were
[1:20:24] baptized they will start thinking why do
[1:20:26] I believe in three
[1:20:29] gods those people who have women
[1:20:31] preachers
[1:20:33] I started thinking hey this is in the
[1:20:35] scripture there's a message in
[1:20:38] the praise the name of our lord then
[1:20:41] song by brother
[1:20:44] Steven praise the name of our lord let
[1:20:46] us have this song s in our
[1:20:49] mid we sing them we own them praise the
[1:20:53] name of say that you know there is a
[1:20:56] change somebody say ah I like their
[1:20:59] music and then that can attract attract
[1:21:01] somebody to
[1:21:06] Christ and then as they come by that the
[1:21:10] word catches
[1:21:13] them praise the name of so let us see
[1:21:16] that our songs we
[1:21:19] sing can bring the spirit of God
[1:21:22] down and then in the message God doesn't
[1:21:24] call man to
[1:21:27] judgment without first warning him he
[1:21:30] says
[1:21:31] Oh, don't that score you out?
[1:21:36] Don't you love those old
[1:21:38] songs? I would rather have
[1:21:42] them than all you
[1:21:44] can or any kind of these kind of songs.
[1:21:48] You can
[1:21:50] have them good old heartfelt
[1:21:56] song. I feel so
[1:21:58] good and happy when I sing
[1:22:03] them just
[1:22:05] good. My just feel like
[1:22:10] rejoicing. Praise the name
[1:22:12] of it that we have this
[1:22:15] song. Even yourself as an individual,
[1:22:19] you are singing this song, you are
[1:22:21] listening to this
[1:22:22] song, they cast out demons.
[1:22:26] Praise the name of our Lord. When Saul
[1:22:28] was troubled with an evil spirit, they
[1:22:32] called David, then David started
[1:22:34] singing. Whenever David would
[1:22:37] sing, Rio
[1:22:39] anointed because the spirit of God was
[1:22:42] upon David. So when he would get the
[1:22:44] equipment to
[1:22:46] sing, praise the name of our Lord, the
[1:22:48] demons will run
[1:22:50] out. Praise the name of our Lord. Like
[1:22:52] even when we come in the services
[1:22:55] sometimes you come with this trouble
[1:22:57] this kind of challenge in life and then
[1:23:00] you get into the song service you find
[1:23:03] the heaviness has gone
[1:23:05] away praise the name of our lord because
[1:23:08] of being part of the service and because
[1:23:10] of the music that has been
[1:23:12] s praise the name of our lord and then
[1:23:15] you feel oh god I thank you and even at
[1:23:18] the end of the service you don't want to
[1:23:20] leave
[1:23:22] because you feel the environment
[1:23:24] is
[1:23:26] like it was good for us to be
[1:23:29] here because the presence of God
[1:23:32] came and that's what should mean to
[1:23:35] us that the song
[1:23:37] leader breaks up the hearts of the
[1:23:40] people before the minister comes the
[1:23:44] ground is
[1:23:45] broken the stone hearts have gone away
[1:23:48] spirits of have left spirits of distra
[1:23:52] left and then somebody's mind is
[1:23:56] open here I am speak to me praise the
[1:24:01] name of Lord that's how we want our
[1:24:03] services praise the name of our lord let
[1:24:06] us go and pick up another scripture
[1:24:09] here in 1
[1:24:14] Coronicles and then verse 1 Coronicles
[1:24:18] chapter 15 verse 15 and
[1:24:29] 16. Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[1:24:32] Bible says
[1:24:36] here and the children of the Levites
[1:24:39] bear the ark of God upon their shoulders
[1:24:43] with the steps there on as Moses
[1:24:45] commanded according to the word of the
[1:24:48] Lord.
[1:25:01] Now the ark of the
[1:25:03] covenant represented the word of
[1:25:07] God. Praise the name of the Lord. It
[1:25:09] represented the word of God.
[1:25:12] them Levites who carried the
[1:25:15] ark on their
[1:25:17] shoulders. Now this was the time when
[1:25:20] they were receiving the
[1:25:23] ark, you know, to put it in a new place
[1:25:27] that David had made. And then the
[1:25:30] scripture says in verse 16, and David
[1:25:34] spoke to the chief of the
[1:25:38] Levites to appoint their brethren to be
[1:25:41] singers with instruments of
[1:25:46] music,
[1:25:48] pulies, and harps and
[1:25:51] symbols
[1:25:54] sounding by lifting up the voice with
[1:25:57] joy.
[1:26:01] Praise the name of Lord. So the
[1:26:04] music
[1:26:06] singing it should come before the
[1:26:10] word and should come after the
[1:26:14] word. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:26:16] the song
[1:26:19] service lead us into the
[1:26:22] word. And as a song
[1:26:24] leader, I should pray to
[1:26:27] God to help me that I may find the mind
[1:26:31] of the
[1:26:34] preacher so that when I'm
[1:26:37] singing, the Holy Ghost guides me to the
[1:26:39] subject of the
[1:26:42] preacher. And that is possible.
[1:26:45] Even the people who sing special
[1:26:48] songs don't come to sing a special
[1:26:52] song. I've learned this.
[1:26:56] Have you prayed about
[1:26:57] it? But when you pray about it, you'll
[1:27:02] find
[1:27:03] that God gives you a
[1:27:05] song. You come before us and sing
[1:27:09] it. And that's the subject of the
[1:27:12] ministry. And then it encourages you.
[1:27:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Like
[1:27:17] there's I remember some
[1:27:19] day. Praise the name of our Lord. I was
[1:27:22] still praying in
[1:27:24] church and then I had a burden that
[1:27:28] morning and then I started
[1:27:30] singing. They that wait upon the Lord
[1:27:35] shall renew their strength. And then I
[1:27:38] was meditating upon that and I wanted to
[1:27:41] see that I can sing that song before the
[1:27:43] church.
[1:27:45] So now when I reached the church, the
[1:27:48] minister was preaching on waiting on the
[1:27:52] Lord. It happened several
[1:27:54] times. If you can't be into the
[1:27:59] spirit and so even our special song, let
[1:28:03] me pray about the song I'm going to
[1:28:05] sing. What is the minister going to
[1:28:07] preach in the name of now? Here my
[1:28:11] brother William and sister faith.
[1:28:15] Faith, what are you going to
[1:28:18] preach? Oh, brother
[1:28:21] Joshua, why don't we all have the same
[1:28:24] contact in
[1:28:29] heaven? You pray to father in
[1:28:32] heaven. What is the preacher going to
[1:28:34] preach? Then when I get that song
[1:28:37] right and come and sing it here and then
[1:28:40] he comes and preaches the
[1:28:42] same then we just say sure the Lord is
[1:28:45] here. Praise the name of you know it's a
[1:28:50] message. It's just like speaking in
[1:28:52] tong and translating it and then it is
[1:28:57] spoken is translated and then it comes
[1:28:59] to pass. You know God is
[1:29:03] here speaking in tongues. Translated and
[1:29:07] then you ask the
[1:29:08] person what has been spoken about
[1:29:15] you like brother Brandham gives it like
[1:29:19] this speaking in tongues. You have a
[1:29:22] stranger who comes to
[1:29:23] church and then one raises with speaking
[1:29:28] tongues and then the translation is
[1:29:30] given. There's a person here. He comes
[1:29:34] from this and this kind of place. He
[1:29:36] said this and this and this during this
[1:29:39] time if you can go and make it right
[1:29:42] you'll be delivered. So you go and ask
[1:29:44] that
[1:29:45] person what has been spoken.
[1:29:50] Is it
[1:29:52] correct? Said yes, it is correct. And
[1:29:55] then brother Brham says that person will
[1:29:57] know sure the Lord is in this
[1:30:00] place. Praise the name of our Lord. when
[1:30:03] you are all in contact with
[1:30:05] him. So you'll find a song leader moving
[1:30:09] you in a
[1:30:11] direction where the minister is going to
[1:30:13] come.
[1:30:15] The song leader is prayed up is
[1:30:19] connected with the father because it's
[1:30:21] the same spirit come here the holy ghost
[1:30:25] turns you
[1:30:27] around praise the name of moves you into
[1:30:30] this direction and then you find this is
[1:30:33] exactly what the Lord was
[1:30:36] showing like you even in the
[1:30:39] congregation God can also make you that
[1:30:42] even before you come to
[1:30:45] You are reading the text of the
[1:30:47] minister. Then you are thinking about
[1:30:49] it. Then when the minister said let us
[1:30:52] turn to this
[1:30:54] book.
[1:30:56] Surely praise the name of Lord. Like I
[1:30:59] remember some time ago we had brother
[1:31:02] green from
[1:31:05] Trinidad. That time I was still working
[1:31:07] in
[1:31:08] Toro and pastor was still staying at and
[1:31:12] I spent a night there.
[1:31:15] So we came for service on
[1:31:18] Sunday and now my mind was actually
[1:31:22] moving in areas of
[1:31:26] shadow. You know life is a shadow and I
[1:31:29] was writing down those notes every day
[1:31:32] and then pastor came and sat by
[1:31:34] me. What are you writing? Then he read.
[1:31:38] Now when he came here to invite brother
[1:31:40] Green to
[1:31:42] preach, brother Green was preaching
[1:31:44] exactly what I was
[1:31:47] writing. But there was no
[1:31:49] communication. But you see the spirit of
[1:31:52] God works in the congregation and then
[1:31:55] works with the
[1:31:56] minister and should also be the same
[1:31:59] thing. The spirit of God working on the
[1:32:02] song leader and also working upon your
[1:32:05] need. Praise the name of Lord. say that
[1:32:08] it's the Holy
[1:32:10] Spirit linking this joint to the other
[1:32:13] joint to the other joint together joint
[1:32:17] because we are a body and the Bible says
[1:32:21] let every joint
[1:32:23] supply let your joint
[1:32:26] supply by being in obedience to the Holy
[1:32:30] Spirit so that when the minister comes
[1:32:32] here the service is not
[1:32:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Make it
[1:32:40] easy for the
[1:32:42] minister. There's a press.
[1:32:45] I think it was
[1:32:49] in you're going
[1:32:51] to do those were during the times when
[1:32:54] there were
[1:32:55] restrictions. We couldn't
[1:32:58] congregate but then they would say okay
[1:33:00] if you gathered then gathered outside or
[1:33:02] things like that.
[1:33:05] So they called me, "Ah, there is a
[1:33:07] church here." That was in
[1:33:11] 2021. It's a new church. So we
[1:33:14] went and then we had a meeting outside
[1:33:18] because we were not allowed to sit
[1:33:20] inside. It was in the compound of a
[1:33:24] school. And then they started singing
[1:33:27] and what now you can't
[1:33:31] imagine when I went to that service to
[1:33:35] preach it was very
[1:33:37] hard 30
[1:33:39] minutes I couldn't preach
[1:33:42] anymore said stop
[1:33:44] here only 30
[1:33:47] minutes and as a
[1:33:49] fact that person has never
[1:33:53] believed when we finished the
[1:33:55] service. He was on busy making us move
[1:33:58] around the
[1:34:00] land. You know, my land starts from
[1:34:02] here.
[1:34:07] And you know sometimes you can even tell
[1:34:09] people have not received
[1:34:19] you because like when we are hosting
[1:34:22] people you know how best you
[1:34:25] prepare hosting people. So now you you
[1:34:28] get the best you
[1:34:30] can. Now for them what they got was the
[1:34:35] poorest you can have.
[1:34:42] Not that we go there to eat
[1:34:44] food, but you
[1:34:47] know we got
[1:34:50] something then you just the spirit from
[1:34:52] the beginning was not
[1:34:55] right. Not that you can't afford to
[1:34:58] eat but your
[1:35:01] attitude. So the whole service was
[1:35:05] hard only 30 minutes but it was even
[1:35:08] hard to finish 30
[1:35:09] minutes and then they think he was
[1:35:11] involving us
[1:35:13] in and then how we was handling
[1:35:16] everything and we have never gone back
[1:35:20] there because there was no urge to go
[1:35:24] back. So let us not make the services
[1:35:30] hard. they are on me.
[1:35:34] No, praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:35:37] just say, "Lord have mercy upon me." And
[1:35:40] when your weakness is
[1:35:41] spoken, say, "Lord, deliver me." Don't
[1:35:45] justify
[1:35:49] it. No, that's not
[1:35:52] right. Say, "Lord, deliver me from
[1:35:55] this. Lord, deliver me from this kind of
[1:35:58] weakness."
[1:36:00] Praise the name of our Lord. And don't
[1:36:02] just be with a rebarious
[1:36:05] spirit. No. Say, Lord, help me in this
[1:36:09] place. I need your help,
[1:36:11] Lord. Praise the name of when God speaks
[1:36:15] your
[1:36:15] weakness, it means he has come to
[1:36:18] deliver from
[1:36:19] that. That's the whole
[1:36:21] thing. Speaks it. Say, Lord, here I am.
[1:36:25] Deliver me. Like when God sent Nathan to
[1:36:28] David,
[1:36:30] David had been in that session that
[1:36:33] thing of
[1:36:34] adultery for a whole year. He was in the
[1:36:38] sin of adultery or he had the sin of a
[1:36:41] doubter and then
[1:36:43] murder a whole year and then God sent
[1:36:49] nothing. When God sent nothing, David
[1:36:52] had even forgotten what he had done.
[1:36:56] man was living
[1:36:57] comfortably. The sheep had given birth
[1:36:59] to a
[1:37:00] child and they living together and then
[1:37:04] the prophet told him this is the thing
[1:37:06] God is against you. You committed
[1:37:09] adultery and then you
[1:37:12] killed. Now
[1:37:14] David said Lord have mercy upon
[1:37:17] me. And when David said, "Lord, forgive
[1:37:21] me." But before
[1:37:23] that, David had already judged himself
[1:37:26] to worth of
[1:37:29] death. That man needs to be
[1:37:32] killed. So when he heard that is the
[1:37:35] man, Lord have
[1:37:37] mercy. Lord, forgive me this. What did
[1:37:40] the prophet
[1:37:41] declare? Your sin has been taken away.
[1:37:46] So before the prophet coming
[1:37:49] the sin was
[1:37:50] there. So even you before your weakness
[1:37:54] is spoken
[1:37:55] about it is still there but when it is
[1:37:59] spoken Lord have mercy on Lord deliver
[1:38:02] him from this and then God says he has
[1:38:06] been taken away and God will give you
[1:38:08] the
[1:38:09] grace not to do it again praise the name
[1:38:12] of that's how the Holy Spirit
[1:38:15] works you know when he says this is the
[1:38:17] problem say Lord I'm here which way
[1:38:20] should I
[1:38:22] this path then you obey you follow and
[1:38:26] then he gives you
[1:38:28] grace like brother Wilson was preaching
[1:38:30] here in the Sunday
[1:38:31] school that there's no
[1:38:34] temptation that comes to you that is not
[1:38:37] common to you but God will always make a
[1:38:40] way of
[1:38:41] escape and sometimes the way of
[1:38:45] escape is when you hear somebody talking
[1:38:47] about
[1:38:49] you that means God has put a way of
[1:38:52] escape. There is deliverance
[1:38:56] here. Praise the name of God. So we need
[1:39:00] to see that when we come into the
[1:39:02] presence of
[1:39:04] God, let us be in the
[1:39:06] spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:39:09] that the Holy
[1:39:11] Spirit can have preeminence in our
[1:39:14] lives. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:39:16] us go to still that same chapter 1
[1:39:19] Coronicles chapter
[1:39:22] 15 and then verse
[1:39:27] 22. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:39:30] Chan the chief of the Levites was for
[1:39:33] song. He instructed about the song
[1:39:36] because he was skillful.
[1:39:51] So there is also talent in these things.
[1:39:56] Yes. The Bible says he was
[1:40:00] skillful like our song
[1:40:03] leaders. How much time do you invest
[1:40:07] in in improving your skill in singing?
[1:40:14] polishing
[1:40:20] it so that it
[1:40:25] shines. Praise the name of our Lord. How
[1:40:27] many times do you say
[1:40:30] okay? You go back and look what now the
[1:40:33] song service you've led
[1:40:37] today. The key was
[1:40:40] bad. Where was the
[1:40:43] problem? Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:40:46] Then you start in
[1:40:47] A, you end up in
[1:40:50] F, then you go to
[1:40:55] E. The Bible says the chief of the
[1:41:00] musician, he was skillful.
[1:41:04] And as by the time you appointed a song
[1:41:06] leader come and lead us,
[1:41:10] You have a
[1:41:16] skill. Why does your skill keep
[1:41:20] flourishing? It is deteriorating.
[1:41:27] Praise the name of like I
[1:41:30] remember when we needed when we had a
[1:41:34] challenge we called brother Jeremiah
[1:41:37] to help us in
[1:41:39] translation and when he
[1:41:41] started you know when you have been
[1:41:43] having the best you feel
[1:41:48] bad but then you have to bear with
[1:41:50] somebody to grow.
[1:41:53] The way he
[1:41:54] started you would
[1:41:56] bear but over time he became the
[1:42:01] best. So it has also to
[1:42:04] grow. Praise the name of like when
[1:42:07] brother is here
[1:42:09] singing maybe looking at only his
[1:42:15] song. I believe in brother Cyrus was the
[1:42:22] same. You don't want to look at people's
[1:42:24] faces. You're just around
[1:42:27] here. And sometimes you try to spot a
[1:42:30] friendly
[1:42:31] face and you only want to look at that
[1:42:33] friendly
[1:42:35] face only that
[1:42:39] corner. But we grow over
[1:42:42] time. But then you have freedom to look
[1:42:44] all over.
[1:42:47] And then you have freedom to bring your
[1:42:48] instrument and then you are playing
[1:42:51] it. Those days you sing to
[1:42:57] yourself. We don't know what
[1:43:01] sing but you
[1:43:03] bear but it shouldn't be continuous like
[1:43:07] that. If I'm a
[1:43:11] translator today I made mistakes.
[1:43:15] But let me not repeat the same mistakes
[1:43:17] the next
[1:43:20] service. Let me be
[1:43:23] improving. Praise the name of like if
[1:43:26] I'm a
[1:43:27] minister. There's a brother they told me
[1:43:30] about that they called him to preach. It
[1:43:32] was his first
[1:43:34] time but he just read the message
[1:43:38] book. Amen. Amen. they meant to himself
[1:43:41] when
[1:43:44] he but of course he improves with
[1:43:47] time so even as our
[1:43:50] gifts they need to
[1:43:52] grow if I'm a song
[1:43:55] leader I need to see that my skill
[1:44:01] grows and growing you must be obedient
[1:44:05] to
[1:44:07] correction praise the name of
[1:44:17] Don't be
[1:44:19] stiff. Allow to be
[1:44:22] corrected. Praise the name of Lord. If
[1:44:24] they tell you there was a problem
[1:44:26] here, take it positively. Say, Lord, how
[1:44:29] can I do? How can I improve
[1:44:32] here? Praise the name of. And then
[1:44:35] you'll see that you
[1:44:36] improving. And then another thing to
[1:44:40] improve learn to listen to others who
[1:44:43] are in that same
[1:44:46] field. Like if I'm a song
[1:44:49] leader get good examples of song
[1:44:54] leaders good message song
[1:44:57] leaders listen to them
[1:45:01] sing. How do they act when they are
[1:45:04] singing? Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:45:07] you know say that I can learn from
[1:45:10] them when I'm singing a
[1:45:13] song you know we are maring to
[1:45:17] Zion I can talk about
[1:45:19] Zion you know
[1:45:22] Zion how many of us are going to
[1:45:24] Zion let the people get and pick
[1:45:27] something out of
[1:45:28] it so if we are maring to
[1:45:31] Zion you don't match when you're seated
[1:45:34] down hey let us stand up that we are
[1:45:38] marching to
[1:45:39] Zion. Make the service
[1:45:42] lively, not some of these churches in
[1:45:46] the
[1:45:53] denomination. Then you
[1:45:55] ask, "What are you happy about when you
[1:45:58] are not happy?" They're not
[1:46:01] happy. The
[1:46:03] confession doesn't match with what is
[1:46:05] expressed.
[1:46:07] Praise the name of our Lord. But you
[1:46:09] know, put the song
[1:46:13] service into the meaning of the
[1:46:16] song. Praise the name of Lord onward
[1:46:21] Christian maring us to war. But now if
[1:46:24] I'm singing onward
[1:46:28] Christian you yourself, you're not a
[1:46:30] soldier the way
[1:46:32] you but you're telling others to be
[1:46:34] soldiers.
[1:46:37] No, lead by
[1:46:38] example and demonstrate it. Praise the
[1:46:42] name of God. Yes. Let us have something
[1:46:45] better than what we've been
[1:46:47] doing. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:46:50] you have the liberty to express
[1:46:53] yourself. And when you're a song
[1:46:58] leader, somebody's putting on the song
[1:47:01] leader. Somebody's putting on the song
[1:47:03] leader song at home.
[1:47:06] Even on our
[1:47:08] functions
[1:47:09] somebody is
[1:47:12] that not what has
[1:47:17] sung that's what has flooded your
[1:47:20] home but then there's song
[1:47:23] services sung at church is what you have
[1:47:26] at home because they are good praise the
[1:47:30] name of so they sang with skill
[1:47:35] So our song
[1:47:37] leaders improve your
[1:47:47] skills like this like show
[1:47:52] like Michael
[1:47:54] Jackson you know I think started break
[1:47:58] dance we don't want those break dances
[1:48:07] He started walking as if he's walking on
[1:48:08] the moon on
[1:48:11] to that moon walking. No, we're not
[1:48:13] looking for
[1:48:15] that like we got some of these
[1:48:17] Pentecostal
[1:48:18] churches the choir they are doing
[1:48:21] acrobatics. When this one looks this
[1:48:23] side, they also look this side. When
[1:48:25] they jump, they jump. They're not
[1:48:28] looking for that. That's
[1:48:30] entertainment. Here we come to
[1:48:33] worship. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:48:36] But you see how you bring the song and
[1:48:39] then get the people into the
[1:48:41] spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:48:43] us stand up. Let us shake one another's
[1:48:46] hands. Let us clap our hands. Praise the
[1:48:49] name of our Lord. And then your
[1:48:52] music has an impact upon somebody's
[1:48:55] life.
[1:48:57] You know there are some people come to
[1:48:58] church because of the
[1:49:01] song. But now these people when they put
[1:49:05] crusades especially in the denomination
[1:49:08] they make sure they do music which can
[1:49:09] attract the
[1:49:13] people but here the Bible
[1:49:17] says he had
[1:49:20] skill. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:49:23] us improve our skills in song.
[1:49:27] Praise the name of our Lord. Let me say
[1:49:29] we can
[1:49:31] finish. So we go to 2 Chronicles chapter
[1:49:39] 5 and then verse
[1:49:43] 12. 2 Chronicles chapter
[1:49:47] 5 and then verse 12.
[1:49:50] The Bible says
[1:49:53] also the Levites which were the singers,
[1:49:56] all of them of
[1:49:58] Asa of the Hmon Jedan with their sons
[1:50:03] and their brethren, being ared in white
[1:50:06] linen, having symbols and pastries and
[1:50:09] hs stood at the east end of the altar,
[1:50:12] and with them 120 priests sounding with
[1:50:16] trumpets.
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:45] And it even came to pass as the trumpets
[1:50:48] and The singers were as one to make one
[1:50:52] sound to be heard in the praising and
[1:50:55] thanking of the Lord. And when they
[1:50:57] lifted up their
[1:50:59] voices with instruments and symbols and
[1:51:02] instruments and then the house was
[1:51:04] filled with a cloud, even the house of
[1:51:07] the Lord.
[1:51:41] So that the priests could not returned
[1:51:43] to minister by reason of the cloud. For
[1:51:46] the glory of the Lord had filled the
[1:51:49] house of
[1:51:57] God. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:52:00] So the Bible says the
[1:52:04] musicians they were all with one
[1:52:07] voice. Praise the name of the Lord. Our
[1:52:10] instruments are not out of
[1:52:13] tune. This one is going east. The other
[1:52:17] one is going west. The other one is
[1:52:19] going
[1:52:20] south. What is this kind of noise like a
[1:52:25] marketplace?
[1:52:27] Coordination. This one pulls the other
[1:52:30] side. Pulls the other side. It will be
[1:52:33] the same
[1:52:34] thing. It it should be the it's like the
[1:52:37] same thing. The song leader is
[1:52:41] east. The congregation is
[1:52:44] west. The instruments are
[1:52:47] north and the minister is
[1:52:52] south. How can we get into the center?
[1:52:54] All of
[1:52:57] us. The song leaders
[1:53:00] come. The people have set instruments
[1:53:02] are not
[1:53:04] ready. Now there is time. Then he starts
[1:53:08] with
[1:53:12] complaining. Then you know he's already
[1:53:15] south. The other one's already
[1:53:19] north. The service becomes
[1:53:22] heavy. The congregation is in
[1:53:26] west when the minister comes. What has
[1:53:30] been happening here all
[1:53:32] along?
[1:53:34] East you don't expect the Holy Ghost
[1:53:36] there.
[1:53:38] You don't other than fault
[1:53:41] [Music]
[1:53:46] finding the other one says
[1:53:50] this we must have a meeting of these
[1:53:53] things is just
[1:53:56] not
[1:54:02] east then the meeting is want to bring
[1:54:04] them
[1:54:06] together. Let us come
[1:54:09] pray. If I'm going to play the
[1:54:12] instrument, let me find out in I'm going
[1:54:14] to play. Is it
[1:54:17] okay? And then also have time
[1:54:20] together. Understand how this one
[1:54:23] plays. Understand this one knows to play
[1:54:25] which one
[1:54:26] better then the equipment
[1:54:29] control. You know the one who controls
[1:54:31] the machines, the mixer, the
[1:54:34] what? He knows okay this is this it
[1:54:37] requires time to put in this
[1:54:40] thing. Wait on your
[1:54:43] ministry. Then the
[1:54:45] congregation coming with
[1:54:47] expectation I'm coming into the presence
[1:54:49] of
[1:54:52] God for you already at the center.
[1:54:56] Praise the name of the Lord. Then the
[1:54:58] musician comes when the spirit of God is
[1:55:01] around. You also come with the spirit of
[1:55:04] God. You also just get into the center.
[1:55:08] The musician's already in the
[1:55:09] center. And then the
[1:55:12] minister should be also in the
[1:55:14] center. Praise the name of And by the
[1:55:17] grace of God. always want to get
[1:55:20] ministers who can put us in the
[1:55:23] center where the spirit of God
[1:55:26] is. Praise the name of our not one who
[1:55:29] comes to
[1:55:34] scatter. Something where we can get
[1:55:36] closer to
[1:55:38] God. So the Bible says they were all in
[1:55:42] one
[1:55:43] voice. The attitude was right.
[1:55:47] The motive was
[1:55:49] right. The desire was
[1:55:51] right. Lord, we've come to
[1:55:54] see. You know, like that song, they come
[1:55:57] from the east. They come from the west.
[1:56:00] He brings them to dine with the mercy.
[1:56:04] Praise the name of those should be our
[1:56:06] services
[1:56:09] every come to dine with the mercy. We've
[1:56:12] come to worship him. We've come to honor
[1:56:15] him.
[1:56:16] Praise the name of we bring all our
[1:56:19] glory. You know the way the Bible says
[1:56:22] in the new
[1:56:24] Jerusalem the kings will come from the
[1:56:26] earth and then they all bring their
[1:56:29] glory to the city. Praise the name of
[1:56:32] our Lord like that queen of
[1:56:35] Sheba came with all her glory with all
[1:56:39] her riches to give to the gift of God.
[1:56:43] And that should be our hearts. Lord,
[1:56:45] I've come into your presence. And when I
[1:56:48] come into the presence, Lord, I've come
[1:56:50] to seek you. Lord, I've come to worship
[1:56:53] you. Lord, I've come to serve you. You
[1:56:56] come with all your heart. Praise the
[1:56:59] name of the Lord. Not leaving part of it
[1:57:02] behind or troubled by what is happening
[1:57:04] at home or tring at a place of work. But
[1:57:08] Lord, I have come in your
[1:57:10] presence. Praise the name of Lord. And
[1:57:13] then you'll see that we are all in
[1:57:15] one. The Holy Ghost has preeminence in
[1:57:20] us. And when God gives me a
[1:57:23] skill better than
[1:57:26] others, you need to humble yourself.
[1:57:31] If it is not me like
[1:57:39] that you think they will think they all
[1:57:41] we are all the
[1:57:43] same the only one they should
[1:57:47] know that mine is better than the other
[1:57:49] one. No, come with a spirit of not
[1:57:53] competition but a spirit to blend
[1:57:57] together. And if you are better than
[1:58:00] others, help others also to
[1:58:03] improve. Praise the name of Lord that
[1:58:06] they become
[1:58:07] better. When you see the kids
[1:58:10] off in your free time, you can go. I had
[1:58:13] you play like this.
[1:58:17] you give me and we try and we start say
[1:58:21] hey this equipment is as good as
[1:58:24] this praise the name of and then our
[1:58:28] parents let us encourage our
[1:58:32] children to be participants in the
[1:58:34] services of the
[1:58:35] Lord encourage them to learn his
[1:58:38] equipment encourage them to come and
[1:58:40] sing
[1:58:41] together encourage our
[1:58:44] children praise the name of our be part
[1:58:47] of
[1:58:48] this if you can get them an equipment at
[1:58:53] home. Very good. You are encouraging
[1:58:56] them. Praise the name of Allah instead
[1:58:59] of spending all the time on
[1:59:03] football which is better.
[1:59:08] If you can buy those iPads of 300
[1:59:14] 400,000, you can buy a G of about
[1:59:18] 300,000. There are some of these
[1:59:21] equipments like we have here our
[1:59:26] trumpet but is
[1:59:29] sleeping. Who can play that
[1:59:32] trumpet? But we are here and gives
[1:59:36] amongst us.
[1:59:37] Why does one come and say, "Oh, I'm
[1:59:39] going to play the
[1:59:43] trumpet." Why would we only burden the
[1:59:45] brothers who are here or the
[1:59:49] sisters? Ah, brother is
[1:59:53] good. But you can play this, play
[1:59:56] this. How about
[1:59:58] you? Hey, where is your goodness now?
[2:00:08] Start asking yourself, "What can I do
[2:00:11] for the
[2:00:12] Lord?" Take
[2:00:14] interest. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:00:17] Take interest. Oh, how do they play
[2:00:20] this? How do they do this? Praise the
[2:00:24] name of the Lord so that the gifts keep
[2:00:26] on
[2:00:27] growing. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:00:30] When you are not
[2:00:31] around, your services are not affected.
[2:00:36] Today we don't have a song
[2:00:39] leader. So the preachers don't
[2:00:43] go. What happened to your song
[2:00:46] leaders? They're looking for green
[2:00:55] pastures. Green
[2:00:59] pastures and then the service is stuck.
[2:01:04] What has
[2:01:05] happened that the equipments are not
[2:01:08] arranged? The other brother went with
[2:01:10] the
[2:01:14] keys. We are not putting random
[2:01:19] services. But you know when next day we
[2:01:22] have a
[2:01:23] service, I'm responsible for
[2:01:25] this. Let me be in time to do my
[2:01:29] role. Sundays we have service. I'm
[2:01:32] responsible for this. Let me do my
[2:01:35] role. Praise the name of And then you
[2:01:38] are showing honor and respect to
[2:01:41] God. Praise the name of our Lord. Ah,
[2:01:44] today I'm meant to be in the
[2:01:46] service. You don't put appointment when
[2:01:48] you're meant to be in
[2:01:50] service. Ah, you know, Sunday, you know,
[2:01:54] I have a business
[2:01:57] deal. No, have respect for God.
[2:02:01] Praise the name of God that you know you
[2:02:04] give your time to the things of
[2:02:06] God. Like our brother Dan was preaching
[2:02:08] on you know fearing
[2:02:11] God over last Wednesday. You know there
[2:02:15] God deserves
[2:02:16] respect. God deserves
[2:02:19] honor. You know we didn't go in most of
[2:02:21] those
[2:02:23] areas because you can come to
[2:02:25] worship but he says it is vain worship.
[2:02:31] We shall go into those areas the next
[2:02:33] time we
[2:02:34] come. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[2:02:37] may God bless you. Praise the name of
[2:02:39] our
[2:02:42] Lord. Let us sing a song as the song
[2:02:46] leader
[2:02:47] comes. We having a meeting outside after
[2:02:50] this
