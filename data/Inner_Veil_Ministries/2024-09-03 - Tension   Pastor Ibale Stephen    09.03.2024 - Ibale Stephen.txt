amen praise the Lord when everything is falling apart just look our way to Jesus amen so we appreciate God for this moment and we are now setting our wings Amen to fly when you look around the world everything is falling apart the economy is falling apart the politics is falling apart family is falling apart nations are falling apart so the world is on tension including our country as we head towards the elections extension all over the place so pray for this country pray for the leadership and I would advise you not to get into the mess but just to keep in prayer amen so uh uh let's stand up we shall go to the book of Lamentations chapter 3 and verse 22 and 23 before we read let's B heads in a word of prayer precious father we thank you because we believe you are present here for you said where two or three are gathered in your name you'll be there in the may your presence Heavenly Father be our blessing take the word Lord teach it to our hearts Comfort where we need comfort bless where we need to be blessed father that our anchor May hold within the rock we thank you Father even as we present all the needs of your children as they whisper their need Lord I pray that you may grant them the desires of their hearts in Jesus name amen amen so Lamentations 3se if the it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they unew every morning great is thy faithfulness may the Lord had blessing the reading of his word you may be seated so today I want to speak on a very small subject the subject of tensions tensions you know tension everywhere you know the word tension May mean being stretched out just like you are dealing with the rubber and you pull it you tense it it can break so this is the tension that's on the world today the world May mean being taken to the limits of patience or Temperance May mean stress due to Moun pressure pressure all a mental strain due to a opposing ideology of a matter amen amen tension is a mind in turbulence tension is a mind inul conflicting over a matter the matter that may not be is Sol it puts you under tension could be a conflict over values you know should I take this should I take that it could be caused by a matter between two people that are bound in a relationship like husband and wife and you see you cannot break your relationship but there are two opposing ideas between you that causes tension amen tension is not a very good thing but is something that we can never avoid amen one would also describe tension as the pressure one experiences in Coming to Terms in a choice of conflicting interests so the world today is in a state of tension and brother Bram described it as the w falling apart so the world is falling apart and every politician every denomination and every church will fall to pieces the political systems are falling apart the UN is falling apart the churches are falling apart the denominations are fall the tension is all over the air in every sector businessmen and attention because different things happen around the world of business every morning the economy is in but thank God that we got a kingdom that cannot be mov it is the Eternal kingdom of God it cannot be more and in the light of all the global turmo know Global turo God needed to congratulate brother Bram by prophecy when he had battled different options and came out up with the right decision as I speak to you all you are having tension over different opinion and so when brother BR made the right decision amen there was a prophecy which was interpreted by Dan Henry and God was saying because thou H has chosen the Narrow Path the hard way thou has walked in your own children amen now sometimes we need to know that when we come to moments of tension it's not the way of list resistance amen that will be right sometimes the harder option is what you need and that's how it is a paradox and God congratulates brother BR for looking at all options and then choosing the Hardway he says thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it's my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee meaning so many people will be waiting for you over there what a glorious decision thou Hast made this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine making the right choices the right choices in life so what happened here is stepped in the moment of tension to come to that hard decision and yet it was the right one so he needed the wisdom of Revelation he needed prayer and determination so it was tension and it will always be tension this world will never be peace until Christ come and you will never be free of tension until you have been changed from moral to immortality that's the only world where there is no tension you are going to have tension in your marriage you are going to have tension in your business you are going to have tension with your children tension is a way of life amen now it was tension when the children of Israel were being pushed by the Egyptian soldiers and all of the sudden in front of them was the Red Sea it was tension moments like that come when we are standing between the Rock and the hard place [Music] so when the three Hebrew children were first by the fire furnace that was tension they were saying make it hotter seven times and then these boys were they waiting for the hottest spot of the fire and now they would be thrown into the amen it was tension but they chose the hard way amen and they say whether our God delivers us he doesn't Deliver us we would rather die in the fire than b the images amen it's always tension it was tension when es saw this birth because he was seeing no future amen it was tension when the doctor pronounced that we have nothing to do for you you just live the way you are until you die it has always been T amen it is tension when you stood up and told the world about the way you are going to live your life it built tension you began to be very careful step you take in life we are talking about t amen so many people say I've got a mind tabulous mind turbulance you must learn to leave to the tension that we are living in in this world now it's going to be hard and going to be harder amen listen to The Prophet here in the M uniting time and sign some people try to introduce Christianity that you are free from worry no you are not you are not free from tension you when you become a Christian because you are kind [Music] ofy whatever it was out there not caring what you did are you together with me yeah you know people say you receive Jesus Christ and you are going to be free know your freedom is you trusting in the Lord for every situation that comes before but the will always be test previously before that you used to do whatever you wanted if it was drinking you would drink your heart would not be condemned if it was going to night club you would go and you would not be bothered but you made a decision and you told the world that you are going to live as a Christian and that now build the tension around amen because you no longer do what you wanted to do in your own eyes amen you are now faced with the challenges of the seison and making the right decisions sometimes the harder choices amen yes ago we used to pray when we wanted but now it's not like that you you pray As you move you pray as you walk on the street you pray when you in your you pray every time amen you studed the Bible when you wanted to but when you are a Christian there is a tension that pushes you forward amen you choose whom to you know when we out there we chose whom to love and whom to ha whom to forgive and not to forgive but now you are obligated to do the right thing amen amen let me say this before you were Christian you used to surender whoever you wanted [Music] toen because it would give you some premin but when you became a Christian you don't do that anymore amen so let me tell you this is a principle that killing your old habits will constantly keep you on taste because they F you all the time and that puts your in tension the prophet says here in the uniting time and sign he says but when you become a Christian every moment you are wondering am I pleasing my Lord I could hear from him it puts you on tension puts you on God that's what makes you what you are so after all tension is a blessing you always wondering am I pleasing you am I doing the right should I do this should I not do that it is tension and that tension will live with you forever amen then the prophet still says if I could have been born without this T I wouldn't have been what I am I wouldn't have been a Christian amen it was this tension that drove me to Jesus so it's been a blessing thing to me amen the pressure you have when you chose to come to the altar that was a blessing if you were born without realizing what tension means you wouldn't be what you are to so today tension is a blessing tension is God's way pushing us to stand in respect of the choices we make in life we made choices for our partners we said we shall love them we said we shall hon and cherish them in sickness and health in Riches of poverty we forsake all others and CLE on to them but you have to make the right decision you said in poverty all riches even when there is no money you are tast of God to honor your obligation amen your obligation amen that will constantly put your tension to fulfill your vows Amen to fulfill the desire of your heart that your people will be my people where you die I will die you made the decision that you are supposed to respect and that puts you in P amen we have tensions in the public because we told the world that we're going to live as Christians and as we first the trials of life we keep saying we have gone too far to go back amen the journey we've covered is too far it doesn't matter I told the world I will not drink again and I've gone so far to turn back and go back to the you understand what I meantion is good it keeps a Christian on God you need tension in your family relationship amen so that you may learn to submit one to another tension is the driving force of a Christian a Christian without tension in life cannot make it as a Christian amen listen see brother BR say speaking of tension I was praying about it this morning what would you do if you what would you do he says just think of it tension is a part of living that kind of encouraged me when I thought that if you had no tension you would be like [Music] a you have no feelings there be you could work on if you have notion you don't know what's good you don't know what's bad if you had no then you wouldn't have anything in your life to work on it would be so unfortunate because you could not be able to tell your understanding amen but every morning you wake up in the morning you wake up challenge will you do this again will you do that again there is a tension and the life of the chrisan is driven by tension amen tension tells me to work on my temper T tells me that I'm obligated to my family amen so as a Christian you need to accept your weak areas without putting up a fight to accept your weak areas without a fire it will cause tension but it will cause you to repair your weak areas amen T brother says really brings you closer together amen if you are a husband and a wife and there station it brings you closer if tension divides the family there is something wrong but when tension you look at where am I contributing are you together with me yeah the husband will say why am I failing in my responsibility I'm talking to brother Henry to brother Henry you just married yesterday amen marriage is not such kind of a bird of roses that you are going to live like honeymoon for forever that smiling sister there one time wakes up with a bad face there is a tension an tension reveals something to be worked amen good brother Steven heard that amen praise the Lord he says and somebody tells you that just think of the little wife that went under a lot of T when he wasn't so good all the husband went under some tension when he wasn't so good then when he so forgiven look how you feel about it amen then he says oh my see you got to have tension all he says you have to have tension tension is good for you you sometimes come to the pastor I don't know what is happening we are not talking we are writing cheat I want to tell you something here there is a man who had a trip and they will have having those bad moments of tension and he was a bad sleeper and so he couldn't want to be the first one to break the [Music] silence or to break the silence so now he wrot a che wake me up at 5:00 in the morning and then when it was 5:00 the sister wrote a cheat it is 5:00 in the morning wake up you see sometimes we need to accept tensions and when it's there you don't Dodge the tension because it's telling you there is something here that we need to speak about so tension in any form of either family or church means you have a concern you just have to drive your concerns the right way amen if you have a conern don't use it as a form of criticism amen tensions will be there when we fa to deal with tensions two people can never live together amen so is a call to prayer amen listen here brother and just think of feelings what you didn't have what if you didn't have any feeling no pains or Nothing what if there been no pain at all you would have no feelings at all and if you had no feelings then one of your senses would be gone so see everything is just right anyhow so God just give us Grace to stand up to it that's the thing if I just stand up with that Grace and stand there and say we know that when this life is over the great one is on the other side where we are look going to and we remember that all these things that t good things will bring T and bad things will bring T when you have got a greater desire like brother Sten want is leaving in now it will bring tension when the family is breaking apart it is still tension so we need as Christians to believe that tension is what makes up our lives we can as well just learn how to deal with tension in our lives amen God allows tensions not separate but that we may get concerned and in certain times he will build these tensions in our individual lives TOA us to stop and over our lives amen he can allow us and you see once you don't deal with tension there will be a break amen you pull a rubber and it is so T and then you continue it you break the tension was too much that this rubber had to break when we were children we used to play with balloons then we would inflate them and when you infl a balloon that is tension if you exceed the tension then the balloon will burst would be having a very wonderful fellowship if all the families understand that life can only be governed by tensions because tensions declare that there is something to deal with amen and sometimes in your Christian Life as an individual as a person God will allow tension in your life so that you may stop and Ponder I take you to Second Corinthians chter 12 and verse 7 the blessing of tension now he says here unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the re s there was given to me a Thor in the flesh the message of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure second Corinthians 127 now I want you to see here a bance of Revelation and then a th here you understand what I mean God you are the one giving me this Revelations then why are you giving me a Thor in my flesh because this Thor here becomes a governor amen when you overcome this then the th goes a little deeper and then you come down then you a little better now this is the individual life of Paul amen that Paul I've given you a lot of Revelations but you are human and I want tell you you will not be able to govern this level of revelation so I'll give you something in your body to keep turning you down amen and then Paul in that condition he says in verse 8 for this thing I the Lord thce that it may depart from me and he said unto me my grace is enough for you have you really had a situation in life maybe you've had some pressure dtic conditions your nerves trouble you and you see when you are young and I'm saying these things you may not be able to understand but you get to a situation where your body instead of being a blessing it is a b have you come to such a point and then you go to God Who Says by my stripes you will heal and then he tells you my grace is enough for you that puts on a lot of tension but on the other side is very good because it keeps you in the presence of the Lord amen he said unto me my grace is enough for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in the infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me hallelujah hallelujah that I will glory in my weakness that the power of God may be glorified in me amen praise the Lord so tension in Paul's life was intended to breed his P due to Great Revelation to keep him on his knees to keep depending on the supernatural is a blessing in this guys especially in the Min the life of a minister because we have the ability to hear from God on certain issues sometimes that are so crucial and so spiritual and if you don't have some tension you will be able to go up like that amen so as a minister you know one need to be conscious of humility amen because when we preaching the World Church is saying amen especially the World Church sometimes getting to of certain fact there is a temptation of taking you at the top of the Tabernacle that's what the devil was trying to do to the law that there is no body in the Tabernacle greater than you every body is below you amen so ministers need to ear you know humility then some of the ministers say yeah Jesus was humble but he had to get a and drove the people out of the temple that's true but was he doing it daily was he doing it daily that is just getting a weap and hipping the people and whipping the people and knocking their heads Jesus didn't do that always we need humility brother Bram would say and may your gift come down lord tonight upon your humble servant and may it be a night of all nights he was conscious of humility he says may your spirit come upon your servant tonight anoint me with your prophetic gift may I be able to do the things that you told me to do are you together with me he was conscious as a minister that I need to remain humble amen and then brother Bram he had cycle amen after the seven years this situation would come back again and he would get so sick he would throw up on the puet run to go to the bathroom you know he's praying for people to be healed his body was being buffeted after every seven years and then 7 Time s amen at the seventh cycle then on the message on the wings of a snow white amen that's where God told him amen that your your your enemy is dead because he would get some kind of he got a vision of this thing jumping over through into him and getting him sick and then again afterwards in that Vision when he was looking he had seen it jump and he had on Cactus and the Lord says your enemy is dead but he was going through moments of tension amen so I want to say this to you that there will be tension mounting around the body of Believers and maybe from within to help the body have a Harmony of Fellowship that's the Paradox of all these legislations coming up against the church will kick the church into tension and then bring the church together amen praise the Lord as long as we are free there is a tend of division the other day something small came up when they were dealing with the marriage bill and then one of the men who was part of this message he went into the Parliament and he says polygamy is right and he was using the name of one of the message churches and all the people came together and they were saying draw a doent and said it to us which defends that monogamy is the stand of this message I did the document praise the Lord all the brothers came together the arguments were no more there I want tell you tension is good tension is good amen now you know tension works in the good times as it works in the b sometimes you are going to have tension you are Desiring to come to terms with the certain matter and then if you don't have t you not have to you to go the message and stud but when that thing comes in did Brother Bram said this the Bible said this that's attention and it drives you into the word one day there was a testimony of a great king that went beyond the borders all the way from Jerusalem up down to Ethiopia are you together with me and then the queen out there how possible could it be that a man could be that wise so she was moved she had to cross you know she got into stress attention so she had to cross on cam three months across the desert that's not a short distance in the desert carrying tens of thousands of dollars worth of gold and silver Brave the desert robers talk about real heart tension that woman was on tension hallelujah hallelujah and I know that you were such a tension so much of attention that brought you down here to prove whether that's what the Bible teaches it was tension that led you to this message amen when the Deep calls to the Deep if there's any part of God in a man the supernatural God begins to move just amen do you remember the words of David as the heart longs for water Brooks so my soul thirsts after thee Oh God T that heart is really fasting for water he has to run until he finds the water and if a man has got God in his heart and he knows that there is an open Fountain somewhere must find that orish amen he will denyed you deny any form of anything to find a drink of a living God that's what starts the real thing moving tension if you miss services and it doesn't do any tension to your life then you are in trouble if you can insult [Music] somebody and you do it without causing any tens then you are in trouble you are a ra as the prophet says so brother Bram tells a story of a man whose chicken didn't have enough eggs to hat so he got one dark egg and put it under the chicken and when that little duck hatched out that was the funniest looking among all the chickens because of this chicken this one [Music] is so the chick would always be there this is a strange sister so that's about like a real believer with a nest full of this [Music] chickens all of them picked on him he must be aoll [Music] long that's what for whens together with me he's not like us those are the fs I want to say it openly the ministers initiate when they begin to promote their own groups against that other group but thank God that's not what we do here are you together with me it's a game of [Music] black ating Spirit you know they keep picking on that so brother Bram says about that the clocking of the hand the little du he would go quack quack she would go clack clack why he didn't know that language a Believer don't know the language come in my dear friends this is one of the greatest churches We Stand 10,000 members and if you just put your name on this book you have a ticket to heaven praise the Lord a back nose is going to be born [Music] again it's not changing churches that will give you the Holiness you need amen are you together with me yeah that's chicken doctr so that knew there had to be a new bath so brother Bram tolds another dark story he tells Brother David who was Raising ducks in cages amen and it was near the river so the River Bank started going [Music] up the tension was coming up and the water Rose the Ducks above the cages and the BS began to Fellowship it was tension a rising River bringing the churches together tension will begin to bless us if we don't volunt fellowship with one another time will come where it will not matter which church you go it doesn't matter thews will put us out so you cannot say I am this or I am that or I am this good news we are Brethren praise the Lord many times you know uh travel strike our home sometimes travel hit our churches it's a blessing in this guys amen some people might say well you are sick just because you are not right with God not necessarily job was right with God and he was sick but is God testing you putting you on a test to see what you'll do amen he [Music] allows the comes and doesn't go and you start wondering why me and the question why not you is you need tension at that time sometimes the tension will be in your home sometimes the tension will be in your business but we must grow to a next where we learn to believe that tension is nor more is a good thing if you don't accept T then you are going to go mental but when you realize that tension is part of life whenever the storms come just become anag and go to the eye of the stor and as it keeps really you just stretch your winds and that wind will lift you up the devil is saying it's not easy yeah he will not tell you that's the solution praise the Lord listen here brother Bram says it reminds me of a German painting in Germany we are talking about tension the blessing of it brother Steven how can you Trav is a blessing because God doesn't want to destroy you that's not how God deals with his children those Storms Come to try our amen so he says it reminds me of a German painting in German it's like the great picture of the Betrayal at Forest La so large they had to build a MTH building to put the painting in the German painting is called the cloud and when you are away from this picture it's most miserable disal looking side amen it's a bunch of clouds just mixing together and as you start walking to the picture it gives you amen oh what a dreadful sight it looks but when you get closer to it is Angels Wings beating together Hallelujah it looks different when you get there when you are far away a dreadful picture when you come closer is horrifying but when you continue and you get exactly closer you start seeing the Angels Wings hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord I want to say something here you don't run away from tension you know what you'll be running away sometimes from the Angels Wings together amen you need to get into the fellowship angs so that you can worship with them together amen and the closer we are to the coming of the Lord the more the tensions will be amen you look at all these nations is tension upon tension station in Randa station in con his tension in the United States the politics is wrong amen his tension in Ukraine exension in Russia amen the economy in itself it's a tension it is becoming hard and hard every day and it is tension in the religious cires amen the traditional churches beginning say that Sodom is okay itation with nature amen you got down here in bishu the mountains are swallowing people you got different places fls are killing people it is tension the whole world is on but where are you as a how will you benefit in the tension this tension here pushes you to go and search in the word is this the time because we were told what was going to be in the end time so we need this T to awaken us hallelujah hallelujah we need to be like a Daniel the Bible says Daniel understood by books you need to go back into your messages you start studying your messages that's where we are going to get the answers to all this tension that's coming up you talk to people even brothers and they are saying when you say so what's the answer hey what have you been saying it's tension but brother Bram says in the message Christ revealed in his own word my mother my mother and your mother struck the age about 35 my wife struck that age about 35 now it's down to 20 the whole human race is rot I want you to hear this very well well if them physical beings of our body is tearing down like a that from eating hybrid food tensions that rot it does not that also rot the brain cell they don't think right they just don't think right opening here the breast the one who sees is the one who will die the brain rotten cells multiplying the negative tensions among the people the people's temper is flaring just a little thing and a man's got a knife we are in the end time okay listen we can see how they can speed through the streets at 120 mil an hour is come to a place where the war Nation the world world not only this nation but everywhere mentally G what we eat is causing the brain cells to rot so that we can no longer have the quality TOs the brains have weakened and a little thing can heighten a big [Music] T to the extent of throwing things all over the house the brain cells rotting away we subject our kids to bad food and even ourselves and we get our brain cells rotten and the decisions we make in life which will be necessary all the time is affected where brother Bram says and where God says he had made the harder choice these days the young people even older people don't want the Hardway shortcut let us finish it like that and these days they've got the song they don't want to stay in a state which is going to bother their decision making are you together with me so you know they don't think right and they find themselves doing things that will be negative in the future so we are living in the age of neurotics men that cannot handle tensions amen praise the Lord now if natural feeding affects spiritual brains I mean natural brain how about bad preaching and you subject people on something that is not balanced from Genesis Revelation what do you expect you are doing to the decision making uh principles of the people when they first t can they make a harder [Music] Choice are you together with me yeah so brother Bram brings us to another height here he tells us Sal you know let me just look at it here it's uh in the message what does thou hear he says you know people listen under the juniper tree is like attention they like to sleep and brother Bram says I preach to more tired people than anybody in the world amen they just put a man where it doesn't go the brains are weak they cannot sustain one hour seron they are sleeping this is the age where we are where people don't like tension chur praise the Lord are you happy this Sunday he says I preach more people than anybody in the world people so tired they are so mentally strin until they are feeling the ins institions and hospitals everywhere they went in such a nervous condition till they don't know what they do believe and what they want they don't know what they believe they move to the next group and they are told this amen and they dance about it when they got this one something else he says to that one amen and they dance about it says they don't know what they believe they are just laying there they don't know what to do he says it is such a sad sign so if poor diet roast the brain cells how about the effect of spiritual diet what would it subject the people to that's why you see that the people have forgotten to preach Christ and they preach church and the people say amen and from there it's only our church and not that church chch and when we teach Christ the emphasis is on the letter and not the person praise the lord we feed people with negative quot which is not meant to be children's food brother Bram directed it to the Catholics organizations but now somebody picks it runs it against his own brother that's poor diet you kill the cous of the people amen and we turn our churches into neurotics because instead of arming them with the [Music] genuine give them something which doesn't belong to them praise the Lord so we cause their spiritual brains to rot the decisions are wrong they are so you know until they are scared of the Brotherhood Brotherhood they can't go to that church they only go to this one is the dieting that they have which causes that there is something which you call social anxiety disorder we call it social anxiety disorder a mental condition which makes somebody avoid the public I want you to be a brother and a sister to one another I want you to know that tension is normal and necessary and even as I speak a number of you are going through tensions as you navigate on what you are hearing amen amen but that's very normal amen now God will subject his church to constructive tensions until all the false bases which the people build on will crumble amen so God will not stand by and just watch his children he allow them amen to be tested he subject them to positive uh tensions and now when the positive tensions come it will cause the people to think it will cause the people to go to the way it will cause them to go to the message they are going to pick out and find the balance level Genesis Revelation and they said this is where I'm going to put my anchor my anchor must hold within the veil you are going to be able to negotiate in the close of the world amen God will not stand by doctrinal interpretations he only want to stand by what he means you know while you Remember The Words which they bound Daniel by they told the king we want you to make a decision here by the law of the M which doesn't change and the King signed and after he signed then he says now the people who don't worship the God let them be fed to animals and the King only realize the wise man Daniel was going into the land's dead and he signed by the love the M which doesn't change he was thrown into the land's day the king didn't sleep the whole night then he came to the lands then in the morning Daniel are you there he said yeah oh your God kept you amen yeah so there is that love that which doesn't change and some people apply that and bring it to the work and they start saying God can only work this way he cannot only work that way always crosses his borders are you together with me so he'll give the baptism of the Holy Ghost Bas on acts 23 amen do you hear that immediately they believe they were baptized they received the Holy Ghost but then the messenger teaches amen that there is justification sanctification of the Holy Ghost so now say how can you say when you believed you got the Holy Ghost Cornelius got it so we serve a God who cres his borders that does not mean justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost does not mean that God cannot baptize with the Holy Ghost according to acts 23 those things to you isn't tension what you hear what you study can bring tension and positive tension God will put up this church to force it to go into the word to force them to go into prayer and petition God Amen so in the message possessing the enem get do you love him yeah he says a few years later when the Trials come and the church got All Shook Up as is so easy for the congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way that it is supposed to be God makes it that way God brings it to the church God bring stations into the church for every son that cometh to God must be tried and proven and tested he let sickness strike you diseases come on you to test you and prove you and to show the world that you are truly the Seed of Abraham he permits it by his own will he perit disaster he permiss the friends to turn away against you he perits all these things and turns the level lose to tempt you and you do all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of Affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he can turn the church against you he can do most anything and it's God's will for him to do it we are that is more precious than God to us amen so tensions will come I am sick I've lost my job I've done this and when tension from the eye condition hit PA God would always just multiply his grace amen so at the closing of time EOS must learn how to strategize in the times of T because tension will come and it comes in many various ways but as a child of God you don't run away from God Amen you get at the eye of the stor and raise your wind the winds themselves the winds will lift you out of the storm and take you to yourself because you are an e amen you see when you know at the closing of time the Eagles must step in the eye of the storm set their wings the Lord do I commit my way the praise the Lord you just commit your way unto him at that time you learn to get into the souls that help you to live in the time of must Jesus the cross praise the Lord there is a stor but storms are always positive stor which stops the tensions we go through and brother Bram Tau the message oncoming storms of judgment and the tension is already on for those stor listen to what brother Bram says I'm just finishing we see the newspapers and the oncoming stor when you go home tonight do me one favor don't go to B till you read Revelations chapter 8 you see the oncoming plagues and storms that shall hit the earth and Thunders and Lightnings are going to shake the heavens boys are going to pass over the nation men will rot in their flesh diseases will strike them doctors knows nothing about but remember before that took place there was a ceiling went forth and the Death Angel and the plagues were commissioned by God don't come near any of those who has a seing their forehead amen and the Seal of God is the B of the Holy Spirit are you together with me so what you need to do as the pastor was teaching here the Wednesday is that it's time it is time for the true B of the Holy Ghost for a child of God you just lift up your hands and you say Lord I need you in these storms of time amen and I want to say those storms are here and they are gathering the economic storms are hitting the Nations families they are going through a lot of financial difficulties these nations we see they undergoing political stormes and I said pray for your nation for the sake of the message to go for religious stores are gathering around and the bride is being prized in the eye of the stor all this that you see going on it is aiming at you did you hear that until a situation is created amen that you come to a spot where you cannot buy or all these laws are prizing but the intention is stop the BR are you together with me so the bride is being pressurized in the eye of the storm you see those little storms which spin around they've got the eye of the storm where it begins to build and the bride is right at that spot where the oncoming storms of judgment are Brewing up to stop you but we thank God that the mighty rushing wind of the Holy Ghost will lift us up here before that storm becomes disastrous amen we've got a place of safety and God is going to raise his bride away amen and what I realize is that we are hitting those spots now amen the bride is being przed in the eye of the stone yes sir she only needs to set wings and then you'll benefit from the ston these storms will only benefit the Eagles because you are designed in such a way but your we amen and your muscles and your feathers cannot be blown out by that stone God created you in such a way that you'll overcome your trials amen we have come to the tension season as the bride turns northward not into her possession because the minister of Malachi 4 already placed us in our possession of every good thing the Holy Ghost promis us that we are turning northward into the change of Dimension amen from moral to immortality amen so as we turn northward the stones will come those stones will be necessary for you to call God down amen but if you been born again and really filled with the Holy Ghost then you are prized by God to stand the pressure that the world can put put against us like that those are the words of brother amen the tension for the sealing of the Holy Ghost is on if you realize every church is talking about the Holy Ghost there is a need there is a tension you just need to set your wings right we shall not be taught to fear the storm but rather to be taught how to stretch out our Mighty Wings of the Old and New Testament the entire world and when the storms blow there will be necessary to lift us up Amen brother Bram says amen how many Christians are in the way are in the way tonight in here that happen that you stand a long time amen D made you start and way down along the road still coming down towards the end I pray that God will Crown your ministry whatever it is it may be a housewife I pray that God will Crown your ministry it may be a preacher it may be a Deon it may be a reader it may be a farmer I don't know what it is whatever it is God Crown your life with the glory of his word Second Coming Rapture and take you away into another land where I just feel like that little fish I talked about out of the Blackness down there they with the kind of no body of there with it this kind of body neither could you go like these astronauts you have to be prized in the tank amen you are you are not prized for it amen but when God changes you you are pressed there you are going in the Rapture there amen when these old Earth senses has been lost and you are going on in that glorious way of the Cross Going Home With Jesus he says you have to be pressed you cannot get that car and then you throw it up in space to start going there like a plane you know it will scatter it it will break to Pieces the storms up there but a plane and the astronaut like the you know the spaceship the Rockets amen they are pressed that it doesn't matter the pressure on the outside of the vessel amen it cannot blow up it's built for that height and you as a child of God you are built for pressure hallelujah hallelujah you are built for tension tension will blow your families but you are going to rise above that pressure pressure will blow amen your jobs but you are going to blow through so the higher the pressure is the higher you are going to be pushed the children of God are prized let the tension come you need it hallelujah hallelujah you need the tension to build you up to be taken out of here hallelujah and God knows what to do he get his bride put him in the eye of the storm when the storm begins it will be taking the eag you'll just be turning your wings turning your wings and you are going to be carried by the stor the same water which destroyed the people in Noah's days is the same water that saved Noah it kept lifting up that a hallelujah hallelujah so when you look at the stones when you look at the tensions when you look at the pressure just learn how to set your wings just go back in your Old Testament Testament balancing the message that when the worst comes to the worst God will be lifting you out of here amen when the storms rage you need a przed tank of Escape tensions are good just look away to Jesus to get the pools amen praise the Lord 1963 I mean 1693
