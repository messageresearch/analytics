[34:53] and brother raay send their greetings
[34:57] so they don't know us but we're praying
[34:59] for them
[35:03] amen
[35:05] amen second
[35:11] Corinthians one thing we know is that no
[35:14] matter where you're
[35:18] from you're in a
[35:21] battle prophet of God told us that we're
[35:24] not called to a
[35:25] picnic a picnic
[35:30] celebration but we're called to a
[35:32] battle in this life is always going to
[35:35] be a
[35:37] battle and there's going to be victories
[35:39] and there's going to be
[35:42] defeats but we know who wins the final
[35:48] battle amen amen 2 Corinthians the 10th
[35:54] chapter and the second verse
[35:58] but I beseech you that I may not be bold
[36:01] when I am present with that confidence
[36:03] wherewith I think to be bold against
[36:05] some which think of of us as if we
[36:08] walked according to the
[36:24] flesh for though we walk in the flesh we
[36:27] do not war after the
[36:34] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[36:38] not carnal But Mighty through God to the
[36:41] pulling down of
[36:50] stronghold casting down imaginations and
[36:53] every High thing that exalteth itself
[36:55] against the knowledge of God and
[36:57] bringing into captivity every thought to
[37:00] The Obedience of
[37:08] [Music]
[37:14] Christ amen amen so the weapons that we
[37:18] are fighting with are not carnal
[37:22] weapons but we are fighting a spiritual
[37:25] battle this morning
[37:28] and I believe it's important to know
[37:30] what our weapon
[37:34] is so this morning just for a title I'd
[37:37] like to speak on word
[37:42] Warfare amen if we can just bow our
[37:44] heads this
[37:47] morning Father we thank you Lord for
[37:49] your grace
[37:51] Lord Jesus we we just we love you this
[37:54] morning
[37:55] Father
[37:57] Lord we ask that you just Lord anoint
[37:59] this word this morning
[38:02] Father Lord that you'd open it to us
[38:05] fresh
[38:07] father Lord that you might be the
[38:09] quickening life behind it
[38:13] father Lord that it might it might
[38:16] encourage us along the way
[38:19] Lord father we we give you all the glory
[38:22] and honor
[38:23] Lord father as you commune with us now
[38:26] we
[38:27] pray in Jesus name
[38:30] amen you may be
[38:33] seated thank you
[38:37] brother I already broke my voice since
[38:39] I've been in
[38:43] Uganda so pray for
[38:47] him
[38:49] amen but Paul is telling us
[38:52] here that our our battle is is not a
[38:55] flesh battle
[38:57] [Music]
[38:58] but the real battle we're fighting is in
[39:00] a spirit
[39:02] realm and we see a as the world in its
[39:06] condition
[39:08] today that Israel is is a natural
[39:13] type of of us in the spiritual is that
[39:18] right and we see Israel is fighting a
[39:21] great battle
[39:23] today and and and they have they have
[39:26] been trained to
[39:29] fight Israel has has been trained to
[39:31] fight since they were a
[39:35] nation they they were born a nation into
[39:41] battle the very uh uh nation of of
[39:46] Hebrews uh came from
[39:49] Abraham when he was coming back from the
[39:51] Battle of the
[39:55] Kings and he crossed over the
[39:59] river so the word Hebrews means one who
[40:02] crosses
[40:05] over so they have been a nation that has
[40:07] been fighting since they were were were
[40:13] created and and and we believe that
[40:16] that's the natural type of the spiritual
[40:22] church for as long as God has had a seed
[40:26] here
[40:29] that seed has always been in a
[40:32] battle but we see that that now in this
[40:35] age that we're
[40:38] in the enemy attacked
[40:41] Israel in their own
[40:45] country on their
[40:47] territory and when the enemy came to
[40:50] Israel's
[40:52] territory it gave the authority to
[40:55] Israel
[40:57] to attack
[40:59] back and now in this age in the
[41:02] spiritual
[41:04] world the devil has come to attack
[41:07] us in our
[41:10] territory not a territory of
[41:13] flesh but on the
[41:15] [Applause]
[41:16] word that is the territory of the seat
[41:20] of
[41:23] God and the and and and the the the
[41:26] devil doesn't realize what he has
[41:29] done is he has awoken a sleeping
[41:34] giant he has awoken a warrior within
[41:40] you that knows how to fight a battle on
[41:44] the
[41:47] word now this is not a battle of fist or
[41:50] of
[41:52] guns but the devil has challenged the
[41:55] authority of the word in this
[42:00] hour and our confidence is in the word
[42:04] will defeat him any time any place
[42:10] anywhere under any condition the word
[42:13] will defeat the
[42:16] Devil so he's picked a fight with
[42:20] us on our
[42:23] territory in the word is that right now
[42:26] I I believe Paul is telling us
[42:29] here that that that our weapons of this
[42:33] Warfare are Mighty through
[42:36] God pulling down the
[42:39] strongholds casting down
[42:43] imagination and everything that exalteth
[42:47] itself above the
[42:50] word anything that exalts itself above
[42:53] the
[42:54] word is defeated by the
[42:59] word hallelujah hallelujah so I'd like
[43:02] to ask this
[43:04] morning how many of us are in a battle
[43:07] this
[43:08] morning how many of us are in a fight
[43:10] this
[43:11] morning but I would like to call to Arms
[43:15] today who's ready who's ready to go back
[43:19] to battle
[43:21] again I believe the enemy has attacked
[43:25] us and attacked us and have gotten us to
[43:30] retreat
[43:32] retreat but I would ask today who's
[43:34] ready to fight back against
[43:37] the who's ready to take the sword of the
[43:39] word The Sword and go forward into
[43:44] battle I believe we have all that we
[43:46] need in this
[43:48] word to defeat every Affliction in this
[43:53] age I believe it's time we use the the
[43:56] word against the
[43:59] devil so I would like to challenge the
[44:01] devil this
[44:03] morning I would like to challenge him to
[44:06] a
[44:08] war on the
[44:11] word not a war of
[44:14] words but a war on the
[44:19] word amen amen the Bible tells us in the
[44:23] book of
[44:25] James to resist the
[44:28] devil and he will the prophet
[44:31] said he'll not just just walk
[44:35] away but he will flee from
[44:38] you now this word
[44:41] resist it means to
[44:44] withstand the force or
[44:49] effect of an
[44:51] attack so it's telling us you will be
[44:54] attacked
[44:58] and you will be
[44:59] tempted but resist the
[45:02] devil and you will overcome the
[45:05] Temptation resist the devil by the power
[45:08] of the
[45:10] word and he will flee from
[45:13] you you see the devil is not scared of
[45:17] me he's not scared of brother
[45:20] Sten or my brother here but he is scared
[45:24] of the word that is inside of
[45:27] us he has been defeated too many
[45:32] times and he recognizes the word inside
[45:35] of
[45:36] you will defeat him
[45:39] anywhere it's time we take the battle to
[45:42] the
[45:44] world Amen brother Brandon would say
[45:49] this is it okay if I just read a little
[45:54] bit he said say that Old
[45:57] Devil now you think he's
[46:01] bold
[46:04] Brazen you think he'll attack a
[46:07] child he'll attack
[46:10] anything he attack Jesus
[46:13] Christ he come at him with three wild
[46:18] attacks did you know that Satan didn't
[46:21] just only attack
[46:23] once he will attack you with a
[46:27] disease and then he'll come back and
[46:30] attack
[46:31] you and tell you the days of Miracles is
[46:36] passed you see the prophet is telling us
[46:40] how the devil does
[46:43] Warfare he will attack your
[46:46] faith and then he will come back and
[46:48] attack the authority of the
[46:52] word the days of Miracles is not pass
[46:57] but Mark 16 is still in full
[47:00] effect and they shall lay their hands on
[47:03] the
[47:03] S and they shall
[47:06] recover you see I don't believe the
[47:08] scripture has
[47:11] expiration I believe if he said it
[47:15] once it still works
[47:18] today
[47:21] amen he says he attacked Jesus three
[47:24] times
[47:26] three wild
[47:29] [Music]
[47:31] attacks he run in on Jesus with his
[47:37] unbelief in God's
[47:39] word but you see Jesus was the
[47:43] word sure he was the
[47:46] word but he said here he come and attack
[47:50] him like the enemy
[47:52] today here they come and said if thou be
[47:55] the Son of
[47:57] God show me a
[48:00] miracle let me see it done he said three
[48:04] attacks and he flew
[48:07] in now what did Jesus
[48:10] do but Jesus was the word of
[48:14] God he was the
[48:17] word he attacked the
[48:20] word with the
[48:24] word
[48:26] you see the devil made a
[48:28] mistake he attacked the
[48:31] word with the word Jesus is the
[48:35] word in the beginning was the
[48:38] word and the Word was with
[48:41] God and the Word was
[48:43] God and he was the embodiment of the
[48:48] word the word made
[48:51] flesh and dwelt among them and what
[48:55] dides Jesus do
[48:57] then he cut him to
[49:00] pieces said he cut the devil to
[49:04] [Music]
[49:07] Pieces what did he use to cut the devil
[49:10] to
[49:12] Pieces the word he used the
[49:17] word Satan came in and attacked the
[49:20] word but the word that he was speaking
[49:23] to was Stronger
[49:27] cut him down with the
[49:29] word hallelujah hallelujah you see his
[49:34] attack Prophet says listen
[49:38] close his attack is
[49:41] what to disbelieve God's
[49:45] word that's his
[49:48] attack and there you could see the
[49:50] greatest battle ever
[49:53] fought there's only two forces
[49:57] Satan and
[50:00] God and what is Satan's weapon against
[50:06] you is to
[50:08] try to get you to disbelieve your
[50:14] weapon he disarms
[50:24] you
[50:26] he disarms you
[50:28] then if he can get you to disbelieve
[50:31] your
[50:34] weapon brother bam said it's equivalent
[50:37] or the
[50:39] same when he gets you to
[50:43] believe that your weapon is not strong
[50:48] enough so Satan's weapon against
[50:52] us is to attack our belever belief that
[50:56] our weapon is strong
[51:02] enough oh he's disarmed you
[51:05] then he's disarmed you
[51:09] then amen but you see the devil doesn't
[51:13] know that he's attacking the same word
[51:17] again in the life of the
[51:20] believer the same word that defeated him
[51:24] there is the same word that will defeat
[51:27] him
[51:29] today amen amen so brother bam says
[51:33] don't ever lay down your
[51:38] weapon don't ever lay down belief in
[51:41] your
[51:45] weapon because he says that finishes
[51:49] it he said he's got you
[51:52] then but he said hold that weapon
[51:57] don't ever lay it
[52:00] down
[52:03] amen if the scripture says it I believe
[52:07] it if the prophet said it I believe
[52:11] it if the Bible said that the word is
[52:14] made
[52:16] flesh and dwelt among
[52:19] you I believe it no matter what it looks
[52:24] like no matter what I feel
[52:27] like the Bible told me that the word was
[52:31] made flesh
[52:33] in the same word that was in
[52:36] Jesus is the same word in
[52:40] you so the same word has the same
[52:45] Authority in the same power in the same
[52:50] manifestation doing the same
[52:52] Works in you the bride B
[52:57] where is the body of Christ
[53:00] today it's
[53:02] you where is the word
[53:05] today it's you where is the weapon of
[53:09] God
[53:11] today it's you you are the
[53:15] weapon that God has
[53:18] chosen defeat the enemy
[53:21] today
[53:23] amen amen
[53:27] am can you understand
[53:30] okay amen can you understand in the
[53:33] back
[53:35] amen praise the Lord
[53:38] God has built
[53:41] you he has thought of
[53:43] you in his
[53:46] mind for this
[53:49] age you see God had a thought for every
[53:54] age
[53:56] God once had a
[53:58] thought of a
[54:01] man that would be so
[54:04] religious he would be trained in the
[54:07] schools he would he would speak all the
[54:11] languages he would know the
[54:15] Scrolls he would be so
[54:18] religious but then that man would be on
[54:22] his road to
[54:24] Damascus
[54:26] and he would be struck by the light of
[54:29] God and he would humble
[54:31] himself to the backside of the
[54:35] desert and that man in God's mind was
[54:40] Paul you see God has a thought for every
[54:46] individual before the foundation of the
[54:49] world God thought of
[54:52] you God thought of your situation
[54:56] but God built you to overcome in this
[55:02] age God thought of an age one time he
[55:05] thought of an
[55:09] age where he would be the Dark
[55:12] Ages Dark
[55:14] Ages and and and men and women would be
[55:18] burned at the
[55:20] Stak and they would be thrown in the
[55:22] Lion's
[55:24] death they would be torn in
[55:27] half but God thought of
[55:30] them to overcome in that
[55:34] age they were under the anointing that
[55:37] God thought of them
[55:41] for God had a thought for John
[55:45] Wesley God had a thought for Martin
[55:48] Luther but God gave them an anointing to
[55:52] overcome their
[55:54] age
[55:56] he also had a thought for the final
[56:00] age but he would also provide an
[56:04] anointing that would overcome in that
[56:08] age you are the final
[56:11] age this is the final
[56:14] chapter and God has thought of
[56:17] you as an overcomer in this
[56:22] age and he provided the
[56:26] anointing that we move
[56:29] in to overcome the
[56:33] [Music]
[56:35] enemy God is proving his
[56:40] word through the
[56:43] believer is that
[56:45] right God is proving his
[56:48] word through
[56:52] you God is proving his strength
[56:56] through your
[56:58] weakness God is proving his
[57:02] power even when you don't feel like
[57:05] it even when you don't look like
[57:08] it God has already spoken over
[57:13] you and no matter what the devil says
[57:15] about you
[57:17] now God first spoke over
[57:23] you no matter what you look like
[57:27] now God already sees a perfect
[57:32] view the prophet of God said it like
[57:36] this before the foundation of the
[57:40] world God took a picture of
[57:44] you he took a perfect picture of
[57:50] you he knows what you look
[57:53] like
[57:55] he knows what you are supposed to
[57:59] be you see in this flesh
[58:04] body we have
[58:07] scars we have
[58:09] sickness the pressure of the
[58:13] age has got us a little
[58:16] down a little
[58:20] heavy but that's not the perfect
[58:23] you
[58:26] there is another
[58:28] youth there is another
[58:31] body that body was perfect in the mind
[58:35] of
[58:36] God before there ever was a
[58:39] scar before there ever was a
[58:43] trial there was already a perfect
[58:48] you that is what we're going back
[58:51] to I believe it's not very far away
[58:57] brother Bram said your theophany is not
[59:00] very far
[59:01] away but it's just a few feet above
[59:05] us I believe that's why we
[59:09] enjoy when we're in Heavenly places in
[59:12] Christ
[59:14] Jesus because it brings us higher
[59:18] up and we can we can feel the effect of
[59:21] the theop
[59:23] body you see it's not very far
[59:27] away it's just a few feet
[59:31] [Music]
[59:32] upen that's why God told
[59:36] John come a little
[59:39] higher come a little higher so you can
[59:43] see a little
[59:45] further you see if the devil Keeps Us
[59:48] looking at where we're
[59:50] at and the circumstances around us
[59:55] our eyes are not
[59:57] up our eyes are not looking to the
[1:00:00] promise if he can distract us to keep
[1:00:03] our eyes down
[1:00:05] here our eyes are not where they're
[1:00:07] supposed to
[1:00:10] be but there is a perfect
[1:00:13] you that we are bringing back to by the
[1:00:21] word I will restore
[1:00:25] sayith the
[1:00:26] Lord all of the
[1:00:28] years that have been taken from you
[1:00:32] because there's a perfect body waiting
[1:00:34] for
[1:00:37] you amen so we recognize this is not a
[1:00:41] flesh
[1:00:43] battle but we are made to
[1:00:47] overcome a spiritual
[1:00:50] battle we recognize by the
[1:00:53] word
[1:00:55] that the weapon is not
[1:00:58] [Music]
[1:01:04] ecclesiastical that's not our
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:16] [Music]
[1:01:18] armor but our
[1:01:21] armor is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:01:26] our armor is it is the rising of the
[1:01:31] sun our armor is the word that's been
[1:01:35] sent before us and we come under the
[1:01:39] anointing of that
[1:01:42] word that is the
[1:01:44] armor that we fight under
[1:01:48] today it's not by head
[1:01:51] knowledge but it's by revelation of
[1:01:53] Jesus Christ
[1:01:54] [Applause]
[1:01:56] in you who you are now the word made
[1:02:03] flesh
[1:02:05] amen so you
[1:02:07] see you're built
[1:02:10] different you were constructed
[1:02:14] different brother Ben would say when she
[1:02:20] recognizes what what she
[1:02:23] is she will be an invincible
[1:02:30] Army so what is
[1:02:34] she what is the
[1:02:37] bride she's
[1:02:40] Christ the anointed
[1:02:42] ones the
[1:02:44] Messiah the word he's attacking the
[1:02:49] word with the
[1:02:51] word but just like he did with Jesus
[1:02:55] he didn't know that he was attacking the
[1:02:57] person of the
[1:02:59] word he asked the question if thou
[1:03:03] be if thou be the Son of God he was
[1:03:07] attacking him he didn't
[1:03:08] know if he was the son of God he said if
[1:03:12] thou be the Son of God if thou be the
[1:03:15] Son of God and he was using the
[1:03:18] word to attack the person of the
[1:03:21] word but the person of the word is the
[1:03:27] word you see in Luke the 4th
[1:03:31] chapter Jesus is being tempted in the
[1:03:35] wilderness but he is the
[1:03:38] word so the devil gives us away his
[1:03:44] weakness the devil's weakness is
[1:03:47] this he
[1:03:49] cannot keep the
[1:03:53] word
[1:03:55] he
[1:03:56] cannot see the
[1:03:59] word he does
[1:04:03] not recognize the
[1:04:07] word it's his
[1:04:10] weakness in John the 8th
[1:04:13] chapter Jesus has a conversation with
[1:04:16] the
[1:04:18] Pharisees and they tell him we have
[1:04:22] Abraham to our father
[1:04:25] he said no you don't have Abraham to
[1:04:26] your
[1:04:28] father if Abraham was your
[1:04:31] father you would know me who is he the
[1:04:36] word they would have
[1:04:39] recognized their day and its
[1:04:44] message but he tells them you are of
[1:04:46] your father the
[1:04:49] devil and his work shall you
[1:04:53] do
[1:04:57] what are the works of the
[1:05:00] devil brother brandom teaches us the
[1:05:03] works of the
[1:05:05] devil is to H breed the
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:11] word he canot keep the word
[1:05:18] pure he could not keep the word the way
[1:05:21] that God made the word
[1:05:26] I think today there's something like
[1:05:29] 20,000
[1:05:32] denominations of this one
[1:05:37] book is it a problem with the
[1:05:42] word it's a problem with man's
[1:05:44] interpretation of the
[1:05:49] word but the word is of no private
[1:05:53] interpretation
[1:05:54] but it's by
[1:05:56] Revelation that comes from God
[1:05:59] Almighty to open your eyes to see the
[1:06:02] word with the spirit of how it was
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:09] brought that's what causes division in
[1:06:12] the message
[1:06:14] today is they'll say what the prophet
[1:06:18] said but they won't say it in the same
[1:06:23] spirit
[1:06:24] that he preached it
[1:06:26] in so it's not enough to know what the
[1:06:29] word is
[1:06:32] saying but you must have the same
[1:06:36] Spirit of how the word was brought
[1:06:40] out amen am you see that is
[1:06:44] something that the devil cannot
[1:06:49] do he cannot have the spirit of the word
[1:06:55] he can keep the
[1:06:57] letter but the letter
[1:07:00] kth but the spirit giv
[1:07:03] life he cannot get to the spirit of the
[1:07:08] word it's not in him to do
[1:07:11] it he was not made available to do
[1:07:17] it he doesn't have the vision to see
[1:07:22] it
[1:07:25] but you
[1:07:27] do amen I
[1:07:30] me brother bradam said that that
[1:07:35] Satan Lucifer comes to every church
[1:07:40] service he's the first one there he
[1:07:44] listens he tries to
[1:07:48] understand and when a point is made
[1:07:51] about a predestinated seed
[1:07:55] everybody shouts and gets
[1:07:58] excited and the devil can't understand
[1:08:06] it why are they so
[1:08:08] excited I just gave that one
[1:08:22] diabetes
[1:08:34] it's
[1:08:38] okay and he wers why we're still
[1:08:45] shouting well I I that that person is
[1:08:48] doesn't have money to go to
[1:08:51] church why are they shouting
[1:08:56] that person is
[1:08:57] sick why are they
[1:09:03] shouting and while this Revelation is
[1:09:06] being
[1:09:08] preached you know what he
[1:09:13] hears
[1:09:16] thunder cuz it's not revealed to
[1:09:19] him but when you hear the word preached
[1:09:23] and you hear message come forth you
[1:09:26] don't hear
[1:09:27] thunder you hear the voice of
[1:09:30] God to you come up
[1:09:33] High come out of the
[1:09:36] Affliction come out of the sickness come
[1:09:40] out of the
[1:09:41] darkness and he's leading you by the
[1:09:44] light you see you are a special class of
[1:09:49] people predestinated in this
[1:09:52] age to overcome the
[1:09:56] devil to overcome him by the
[1:10:00] word it's already in
[1:10:03] you everything you need to
[1:10:06] overcome is already in
[1:10:09] you God before the foundation of the
[1:10:13] world put that within
[1:10:18] you and the devil can't understand
[1:10:22] it why why are they still
[1:10:25] here why have they not given
[1:10:28] up why are they still
[1:10:31] worshiping why are they still reading
[1:10:34] the
[1:10:34] word because there's a seed within
[1:10:39] [Applause]
[1:10:43] you and Satan cannot touch the
[1:10:50] seed he can't touch the life
[1:10:54] he can't touch the seed within
[1:10:57] you is that right in job's
[1:11:02] story touch everything you want but the
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:22] life so that tells
[1:11:25] us that we can go
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:30] places where the devil can't follow
[1:11:35] us we can go places in this
[1:11:38] [Music]
[1:11:39] word where the devil can't follow
[1:11:44] you is that right you were built higher
[1:11:48] than he was
[1:11:52] built you were made different than he
[1:11:55] was

[1:12:02] here that the devil cannot reach
[1:12:06] you

[1:12:15] that Jesus tells
[1:12:19] them you're of your father the
[1:12:22] devil and his works are to hbed the
[1:12:26] word we see this in the trail of the
[1:12:29] serpent through the scripture the trail
[1:12:32] of the
[1:12:35] serpent Right started in the garden
[1:12:42] right what did he do he changed the

[1:15:01] word it's the works of our
[1:15:05] father we keep the
[1:15:09] word the devil cannot do
[1:15:12] it it's it's not in him to do
[1:15:16] it brother said that God would have
[1:15:18] forgiven
[1:15:22] Cain Cain would have
[1:15:26] repented but he said it wasn't in him to
[1:15:29] do
[1:15:33] it but it's in
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:38] you you see the
[1:15:42] difference the trail of the
[1:15:44] serpent the trail of the
[1:15:48] dove every Revival produces
[1:15:52] twins
[1:15:54] and the difference in the two
[1:15:57] twins is one cannot keep the
[1:16:00] word and one keeps the
[1:16:04] word hallelujah hallelujah I know what
[1:16:07] side I'm
[1:16:09] on I'm on the word keeping
[1:16:13] side I'm on the stay with the word
[1:16:16] side hallelujah hallelujah amen God Gave
[1:16:20] You
[1:16:21] ability that did not give to
[1:16:26] Satan God loved
[1:16:28] Jacob and he hated
[1:16:31] Esau because Jacob was built to keep the
[1:16:40] word he wanted the
[1:16:46] birthright hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:16:50] am we'll skip through some of this here
[1:16:55] you see you were given
[1:16:57] ability that the devil does not have
[1:17:00] access
[1:17:02] to you were given elements that the
[1:17:05] devil does not have access
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:09] to
[1:17:11] Amen brother Bram says this did you ever
[1:17:15] read of the urum in the
[1:17:20] Bible where they looked upon it
[1:17:24] and that
[1:17:25] breastplate where God would talk through
[1:17:28] that
[1:17:32] breastplate now the devil made a crystal
[1:17:37] gaze for a substitute for
[1:17:40] that but the UR and
[1:17:43] Thum they looked upon
[1:17:46] it and the lights
[1:17:50] changed that that's when God would sanct
[1:17:54] something he says that is a
[1:17:57] type of the word of God
[1:18:01] today there's three ways that God talks
[1:18:06] through the prophet through
[1:18:09] dreams through the Europe Through the
[1:18:13] Bible now through
[1:18:15] Revelation and through the prophet the
[1:18:18] same way
[1:18:20] today see this is the hear him
[1:18:24] here now and then if any
[1:18:27] dream or any Vision or anything you
[1:18:32] have does not compare with
[1:18:35] this it is not God
[1:18:39] talking but if it's right on this then
[1:18:43] it's God talking to
[1:18:45] you so Jesus is the same
[1:18:49] yesterday today and forever in his
[1:18:53] church the same Pillar of Fire doing the
[1:18:57] same signs and
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:01] wonders so the prophet is telling
[1:19:04] us that Satan will try to impersonate
[1:19:10] this he'll try to impersonate the
[1:19:13] authority of the
[1:19:15] word and and we know the story in the
[1:19:19] scripture where they had built the
[1:19:22] Tabernacle in the
[1:19:24] wilderness and they had gotten
[1:19:27] instructions from
[1:19:28] God instructions
[1:19:32] Direction on how to build
[1:19:36] it hallelujah hallelujah brother I don't
[1:19:39] know if it's going to be hard for you to
[1:19:40] translate if you need this in your
[1:19:42] scripture but we're going to read Exodus
[1:19:44] 28 are we
[1:19:47] okay are we
[1:19:49] okay
[1:19:51] amen
[1:19:59] Exodus the 28th
[1:20:05] chapter brother Bram said the Bible
[1:20:08] said in the last
[1:20:11] days the devil will impersonate
[1:20:16] Christianity so
[1:20:17] close till it'll deceive the very
[1:20:20] elected if possible
[1:20:24] that's right so we must test
[1:20:27] it how did they test it in their
[1:20:31] day to the urum
[1:20:33] Thum the breastplate of
[1:20:36] Aaron that had those stones in
[1:20:39] it that represent the birth of these 12
[1:20:45] Patriarchs they was in the breastplate
[1:20:47] of
[1:20:48] Aaron and when a prophet
[1:20:51] prophesied that sacred light flashed
[1:20:54] over
[1:20:56] it and God said that is the
[1:20:59] truth no matter how real it
[1:21:03] seemed if it did not flash on
[1:21:08] that it was not the
[1:21:10] truth so the urum and Thum went with the
[1:21:17] priesthood this
[1:21:19] Bible is God's urum Thum today
[1:21:25] and when a prophet
[1:21:27] prophesies it must absolutely flash with
[1:21:31] the
[1:21:33] Bible then God comes down and proves
[1:21:37] it amen they have to ring true to the
[1:21:43] blueprint to the
[1:21:48] plan hallelujah hallelujah so God gave
[1:21:51] this direction to
[1:21:55] Moses and it was it was not a
[1:21:58] helmet it was not a
[1:22:00] hat it didn't go over the
[1:22:04] mind but the breastplate goes over the
[1:22:10] heart Exodus
[1:22:15] 28:15 time and thou shalt make the
[1:22:18] breastplate of judgment with cunning
[1:22:20] work after the work work of the ephod
[1:22:23] Thou shalt make it of gold of blue of
[1:22:26] purple of scarlet and of fine twine
[1:22:28] linen Thou shalt make
[1:22:35] [Music]
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:51] it
[1:22:58] Four Square it shall be being doubled a
[1:23:01] span shall be the length thereof and a
[1:23:04] span shall be the breadth
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:13] thereof and thou shalt set
[1:23:21] sorry
[1:23:25] and thou shalt set in it settings of
[1:23:28] stones even four rows of stones the
[1:23:32] first row shall be sardius a topaz and a
[1:23:35] carbuncle this shall be the first
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:51] row
[1:23:57] and the second row shall be an admiral
[1:23:59] the sapphire in a
[1:24:05] diamond and the third row of the girl
[1:24:08] and an aot and an
[1:24:14] [Music]
[1:24:18] amethyst and the fourth row a barrel and
[1:24:21] an onx and a Jasper
[1:24:23] they shall be set in gold in their
[1:24:39] enclosing and the stone shall be with
[1:24:42] the names of the children of Israel 12
[1:24:45] according to their names like the
[1:24:47] Engravings of a signant everyone with
[1:24:50] his name shall be according to the 12
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:25:14] tribes
[1:25:16] good yeah that's it
[1:25:19] 21 amen so we see that God gave Moses
[1:25:26] instructions and these weren't just just
[1:25:29] uh just hey build
[1:25:33] this but they were very specific
[1:25:38] instructions very very direct
[1:25:43] instructions on how this urum was to be
[1:25:48] built because it had to be built just
[1:25:51] the right way
[1:25:54] in order for the lights to flash across
[1:25:58] it and ring the right
[1:26:03] color amen we understand amen so God
[1:26:08] told Moses specific this is how it is
[1:26:14] built it must be fashion just this
[1:26:17] [Music]
[1:26:20] way it's got to be just in this
[1:26:24] line with all these colors and in
[1:26:29] gold and when when the word is brought
[1:26:32] before
[1:26:33] it it will it will tell you if it's the
[1:26:37] true
[1:26:38] word or a false
[1:26:41] word so God has a
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:46] plan we don't have to
[1:26:49] guess what is the true word
[1:26:53] but God provided a
[1:26:55] way that we would
[1:26:58] know what the pure word of God
[1:27:02] is it will ring
[1:27:04] true the color will flash across the
[1:27:09] word now we are not under a man's
[1:27:15] interpretation but we are under God's
[1:27:18] interpretation of the
[1:27:20] word and if it do doesn't vindicate
[1:27:25] itself it's not the pure word of
[1:27:28] God but if it is
[1:27:32] Vindicated then it is God's voice itself
[1:27:36] coming to the
[1:27:37] [Applause]
[1:27:42] church hallelujah hallelujah we're not
[1:27:45] just following some man's
[1:27:50] fables but this message of the hour has
[1:27:52] been Vindicated and Vindicated and
[1:27:56] Vindicated and
[1:27:58] Vindicated I think somebody back home
[1:28:01] did a
[1:28:02] count a
[1:28:06] count on
[1:28:08] tape how many
[1:28:10] times that the prophet discerned an
[1:28:16] individual and some of those
[1:28:21] discernments were 22 different items in
[1:28:24] one
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:30] discernment over
[1:28:33] 8,300
[1:28:38] times on
[1:28:40] tape Vindicated discernment coming
[1:28:46] forth so if he Vindicated the first and
[1:28:49] the second
[1:28:51] poll
[1:28:54] God has also Vindicated the third
[1:28:57] pole because the word lines up with the
[1:29:02] word there's no problem with the
[1:29:06] word but we have a man
[1:29:09] problem where men have gotten into the
[1:29:12] interpretation of the
[1:29:15] word but we are going back to the
[1:29:18] original
[1:29:20] word to the original
[1:29:23] Faith man didn't have his hand in
[1:29:26] it man did not have his hand in
[1:29:30] it but it was God speaking to
[1:29:36] man watch the phase of the ministry of
[1:29:38] William
[1:29:41] brandom God gave him such a powerful
[1:29:43] gift of
[1:29:45] discernment that one individual would
[1:29:48] come and he would tell them 20 different
[1:29:50] things
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:58] it's
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:03] okay he was not
[1:30:08] guessing he was not
[1:30:10] guessing but he was Discerning the
[1:30:13] intense of the
[1:30:17] Heart Right Jesus was not guessing with
[1:30:21] the woman at the
[1:30:24] well but he was Discerning her
[1:30:29] heart so in the third phase of brother
[1:30:32] benham's
[1:30:35] Ministry he was not just Discerning
[1:30:37] anybody's
[1:30:41] heart but he was turning his attention
[1:30:44] to the Heart of Jesus
[1:30:49] Christ and revealing the secrets of the
[1:30:54] heart revealing the secrets of the
[1:30:59] heart he was not
[1:31:01] guessing but he was in the heart of
[1:31:07] God expressing to
[1:31:09] us what God thinks about
[1:31:14] us he was not
[1:31:16] guessing like he knew the heart of
[1:31:20] God concerning
[1:31:23] you hallelujah hallelujah it rang across
[1:31:27] the
[1:31:28] Europe it
[1:31:31] flashed across the
[1:31:33] Europe it was the Vindicated word of
[1:31:38] God it has told us what God thinks about
[1:31:43] us for I know the thoughts that I think
[1:31:46] towards
[1:31:47] you are thoughts of good there are
[1:31:51] thoughts of peace
[1:31:53] our thoughts to an expected
[1:31:56] end God already knows what he thinks
[1:31:59] about
[1:32:00] you and through the message of the
[1:32:04] hour we know what God thinks about
[1:32:09] us hallelujah hallelujah he made a way
[1:32:12] of Escape for
[1:32:14] us that the devil cannot
[1:32:19] follow he can try to imp person
[1:32:23] he could try to mimic
[1:32:26] it but he can never be the real
[1:32:33] thing Satan can never be the real
[1:32:39] believer it's not in him to do
[1:32:43] it Hallelujah brother says Esau
[1:32:49] represented the man of the
[1:32:52] Earth
[1:32:54] religious but never
[1:32:58] able it was not in him to do it he could
[1:33:02] not do it it was never in him to climb
[1:33:07] past the things of the
[1:33:10] world the carnal
[1:33:12] thing but for
[1:33:15] Jacob it was so easy for him to do
[1:33:19] it one purpose Jacob
[1:33:22] had and that was that he longed for the
[1:33:27] birthright no matter how he got
[1:33:30] it he got it amen it was not in
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:40] Esau he literally was not built the same
[1:33:45] as Jacob was
[1:33:50] built
[1:33:52] Cain literally was not built the same
[1:33:56] Abel was
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:34:00] built something was
[1:34:03] missing something was missing in
[1:34:07] Esau Abel had something that Cain did
[1:34:10] not
[1:34:12] have Jacob had
[1:34:15] something that Esau did not
[1:34:18] have he was built different
[1:34:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you are
[1:34:28] built
[1:34:30] different than any other age before
[1:34:35] us this is the eagle
[1:34:38] age you can fly higher than any other
[1:34:42] age before
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:45] you you are literally built
[1:34:49] different than anyone else else that has
[1:34:52] come before

[1:34:56] follow an
[1:34:58] eagle follow an
[1:35:00] eagle he can't fly that
[1:35:03] high brother B said he will start to
[1:35:08] shake he will he will explode under the
[1:35:13] pressure he's not built the same as an
[1:35:18] eagle but you were built
[1:35:22] you were made
[1:35:23] higher you were made to climb
[1:35:27] higher than where the devil can follow
[1:35:31] you he cannot follow you into the
[1:35:34] heights of the
[1:35:36] world he cannot walk where you can
[1:35:40] walk it's literally not in him to do it
[1:35:45] it's not in
[1:35:47] him but it's in
[1:35:50] you he came cannot keep the
[1:35:54] word but you

[1:36:40] verse we're going to show through the
[1:36:44] scripture how that you were built
[1:36:47] different than Lucifer was
[1:36:50] built
[1:36:51] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[1:36:53] me saying the 11th
[1:36:57] verse said of man take up a lamentation
[1:37:01] upon the king of
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:06] Tyrus and saith unto him thus sayith the
[1:37:09] Lord
[1:37:11] God thou seest up the PM full of wisdom
[1:37:16] and perfect in
[1:37:20] Beauty
[1:37:23] brother Bram tells us this is speaking
[1:37:25] of
[1:37:27] Lucifer the king of
[1:37:30] Tyrus thou Hast been in
[1:37:32] Eden the Garden of
[1:37:35] God and every precious stone was that
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:47] covering the
[1:37:49] sardius the topaz
[1:37:51] the
[1:37:52] diamond the
[1:37:54] barrel the onx The
[1:37:57] Jasper the
[1:37:59] sappire the
[1:38:01] emerald the
[1:38:03] car and
[1:38:05] gold the Workman ship of thy
[1:38:10] tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in
[1:38:14] thee in the day that thou was
[1:38:20] created
[1:38:22] so he had a
[1:38:25] beginning Lucifer had a
[1:38:29] beginning in the day thou was
[1:38:34] created Thou Art the anointed cherub
[1:38:37] that
[1:38:40] coverthe
[1:38:43] so thou was upon the holy mountain of
[1:38:48] God thou Hast walked up and down down in
[1:38:51] the midst of the stones of
[1:38:56] fire thou was perfect in thy
[1:39:00] ways from the day thou was
[1:39:04] created
[1:39:06] until
[1:39:08] until iniquity was
[1:39:17] found he had a
[1:39:20] beginning all things that have a
[1:39:23] beginning shall have an
[1:39:27] end he's built different than you're
[1:39:31] built he was he was created
[1:39:35] after you see we never had a moment
[1:39:38] where we
[1:39:40] began but we were always in the mind of
[1:39:44] God we were always in the mind of
[1:39:48] Elohim so before there ever was was a
[1:39:53] Lucifer you already
[1:39:56] were before there ever was a
[1:39:59] trial you already were before there ever
[1:40:03] was a
[1:40:06] Leia you already
[1:40:08] were in the mind of
[1:40:13] Elohim we came
[1:40:18] before you are older than the devil
[1:40:22] [Music]
[1:40:25] you had no
[1:40:27] beginning and you will have no
[1:40:30] way because you came from your father
[1:40:34] and you go back to your
[1:40:36] father no ending of days but you always
[1:40:41] will
[1:40:42] be hallelujah
[1:40:45] hallelujah there's no end to
[1:40:49] you those in the passed on in the
[1:40:52] grave they're not dead but they
[1:40:57] sleepeth there's no end to a thought of
[1:41:02] God it always
[1:41:04] was and always will
[1:41:08] be Eternal are the thoughts of
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:11] godam says the thoughts of God are
[1:41:16] Eternal and they are
[1:41:19] real they always
[1:41:22] were and they always will
[1:41:27] be he's
[1:41:29] built different than you're
[1:41:37] built in Exodus that we read the 28th
[1:41:42] chapter we counted 12
[1:41:46] Stones is that right one for each tribe
[1:41:52] there were 12 Stones on the
[1:41:56] breastplate in four
[1:41:59] rows 12
[1:42:02] Stones in Ezekiel the 28th
[1:42:06] chapter we just read how that he was
[1:42:11] created and I don't think that God's bad
[1:42:14] at math God's not bad at
[1:42:17] math he knows how to do math
[1:42:22] there's only
[1:42:27] nine there's only
[1:42:30] nine in in in Moses's direction to build
[1:42:34] the
[1:42:37] breastplate
[1:42:39] 12 when Jesus when God is is speaking
[1:42:42] through
[1:42:45] Ezekiel he says how that Lucifer was
[1:42:49] created
[1:42:56] something's
[1:43:00] missing you are literally built
[1:43:04] different than Lucifer was
[1:43:07] built God designs you
[1:43:11] different than he designed
[1:43:14] Lucifer so you can go
