thank you lord for this day we thank you again for the service we pray that lord you may grant speak to us again tonight and once again a great in the name of our lord jesus christ i appreciate the pastor for yet another opportunity amen amen i want to preach on our high calling of god in christ our high calling of god in christ and now that word it's not an earthly calling see or without yani it's not a political calling so it talks here sir not not even a professional calling well i see we told what he saw me but it's an upward calling the jew too it is an upward calling that paul was talking about we told uh about paulo now let us maybe try to look at the different scenarios then we get praise and you know like maybe somebody is a teacher ah penguin named that is their calling you want your me to work that is something they like the most okay so a teacher will know how to make lesson plans know how to handle children or whatever level so he has to go through some form of training computer my friends are flying and you know as teachers they also have grades or levels maybe from teaching the young children to get on a physician maybe to teaching primarily i want um are very high levels like somebody maybe can do dog traits then again i'll find out that you are using you know those kind of levels for a teacher if we can strike that level of having a post-doctorate degree [Music] it's just the same thing maybe for doctors maybe and then he's able to to treat the most complicated case analysis then he will be having that kind of satisfaction you know and then maybe a businessman it may start with the capital of maybe ten thousand tanzanian shillings he does his merchandise and now it increases to one million and now millionaire there you find it has increased so much like there is a man i read the entire of in tanzania i'm forgetting his name but it was an elderly man i think he died when he was seven something he was just as i died last year uh you know they kind of told me and they married the young wife was maybe a popular person he was talking about how he started from a humble family putting money in to help other people now here paul is telling us praise the name of us when we go to philippians chapter 3. now for us to gain christ that's an in our illegici praise and the movement then he said yeah doubtlessly ah and i count all things but loss for the excellence of the knowledge of christ that's an amazing [Music] and account them but down that i may win christ crystal praise the name of our lord there has to be an exchange there are things you have that he counted all the things he had known okay i that he may gain the excellence of christ really our part of a crystal and then you know and it should be something that is continuous in our lives us may be bringing you just confess the lord jesus as your personal savior you know i'm curious to christopher because but there are things that you do which are not right but still you they will bear with you because you've just come in and as you keep on moving up in the left so you start learning that this thing is wrong behind them because i'm speaking is not right is not the the splint you know of you know these people run a hundred meters three or two zillion bills can be a minimum it goes for a hundred meters you really have to be very fast pass away the scenery around keep on changing you know you know okay like for example if i am going from this place uh come on assume it's about 10 or 20 kilometers able to kill a company kilometers i'll run through the town genie after may not be tomorrow's challenges [Applause] accepted the lord jesus when i was in high school uh secondary so i finished my high school i went to the university okay i finished the university i started working because then working i married you but i can tell you in the journey that i have gone through well so far in the opportunity just received the message and the temptations are not the same like what i'm going through now my [Applause] you know when i was maybe in the school beginning in any position when i finished school people are different to fault but it's the same devil luckily and you see that on our high calling opposition and it is the same devil now you've been listening he's always there to oppose you but then we have the courage from god you need to know their syria there is no trial that will come to you unless [Applause] you're not going to run the marathon as if you're running a hundred minutes where is it going to be i'm being deaf come on now can be um break out pray is the name of god so now you see these people the way they are pacing when they praise the name of allah you know let us go to hebrews chapter 12 quest we are forcing we are also encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside many quite many years that thing has been there when when a person finishes university they want that same year to get a job to get a wife [Applause] but this one wants god takes us through child training things that god will subject you to [Applause] you're not going to start p1 or west once uh i don't know how they call a prime either it's prime minister what's going on yeah you're not going to start primarily one this year you are very bright and you sit p7 this same yeah so now our upward calling in christ are you willing to wait to a joke or crystal there are things that god takes you through a christian competition praise the name of our lord you know whatever you like when paul come after the power he was saying i spoke as a child and you know for a child no you are coming back today you know of course when you start teaching a child you want the child to say mama talking about repeating repeating [Applause] [Music] you need to put your failures if you are going to continually think about your sin come out and they're not clear you will not succeed to overcome the devil pray in the name of our lord you know whatever you see how you can overcome the devil can you know my little [Applause] in the calling of christ or christian he doesn't want you to sing attack [Applause] [Applause] that as you are moving in this year that's not pointless and you are falling short of the requirement of not sinning the blood of jesus christ that if you become inadequate come out here to shaykh if you sin come on on this journey then he points you to the blood so you still have to go into the blood and there you go and confess your sin now you're moving now in the land is the name of ours so our highway our high calling for your withdrawal of jews god has provided all that we have need of in this year called us were you really acquitted he is faithful so then we look at the lord that's what the bible is told hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 with patience and the patience and any patience there is suffering familiar there is pain praise the name of god because to be patient means there's something you are suffering there is something you are tolerating it is not pleasant you have somebody you [Applause] by anyone's relationship who is this initiator behind the orientation who is the one who starts your face he starts your faith and he's the one to complete your faith is the author and finisher yeah in the men's relation you need to start the journey with christ you need to complete it with christ now when are your lingo let us go back to philippians chapter three now twin day of philippi here is so like tattoo praise the name of our lord verse 14. william started you are coming and he says i praise to one the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ he says i pray some window i pursue nina praise the which is [Applause] now you see at that point in this book of philippians look at the question of philippi which is according to the historians he wrote it in 1864. that paul didn't know him uh he managed to come back home do we paul knew christ our lord him from christ but he deserved to know more of christ praying the name of god the holy spirit [Applause] [Applause] not as though i had already attained security configure either were already perfect but i follow after luckily if that i may apprehend healing that for which also i'm apprehended of christ that i follow after you just the calling that god has called us listen we talk about movement twitter is something that is continuous praise the name of god is a continuous kind of holding god [Music] [Applause] not he that comes in see are you annoying here and then he goes out naked but the bible says can you believe it endures yes to the end how the mission the same shall be saved so even when jesus was telling his disciples you have believed in me how can you harm your ministry you continue in my wife if you continue come up and this [Applause] it's not coming in today if we check with each other you'll go out the following day now shall not talk it will not help you it actually idea what does the bible say of the devil what does the bible say about satan [Applause] you are of your father the devil ah and the last of your father you will do not know he was a murderer from the beginning and and then let us read that verse four and five and that because of false brother unaware is brought in who came in privately to spy out our liberty company their liberty and then he says they came that they can take us back into bondage you have to release your turn upon your tumor and then in verse five he says that's some study to whom we gave place by subjection not for an hour you see now they entered into the p they entered among the people but they were false brethren and now when they started saying what they were saying they heard them what do you say didn't obey them for one hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you [Applause] and then we start reading from verse 30. and as he spoke these words many believed on him then jesus said to those jews which believed on him yes if you continue in my wife then you are my disciples praise [Music] as long as your faith lasts really in bloody immanuel command so if you get healed now come on upon yourself you need to believe in a possible meaning that you are healed but along the way if you believe i'm not healed come out i mean one person's your opponent you'll get back into the problem you have a base out i wrote the ten community that's what it is even the believer praise the name of god what does the bible say when an evil spirit is cast out of a person you're a wrong child foreign in the wilderness in dry places and then he desires to come back of the house is your face me money so if that evil spirit comes back and doesn't get their face it goes back and rude and gets so now when jesus was delivering the people oh yeah yeah yes he told them go and sin no more when they stand up is the good master of this man indeed even our salvation i talk of where to you shouldn't lose what you're saying a man in christ christian that he saves you i'm buying liquor pray in the name of god you're never gonna kill me you shouldn't lose faith [Applause] [Applause] where is it because salvation is of the lord don't look at your abilities we need to look what the finished work on the caravan is called finished [Applause] be hard beginning but you just call upon the name of the lord what does the bible say even the bible shall call upon the name shall be said pray is the name of our lord daniel daniel when he saw [Applause] [Applause] let us read the book of daniel daniel praise the name of our lord you know barnabas here and then we read the verse then in chapter 10. daniel cooper and verse 15. started and when he had spoken such words unto me i set my face toward the ground

the name of our lord don't be ashamed to tell god your condition open enough to god oh this is my weakness this is where how come you know there are people who make mistakes and then they don't care like anyhow you just go away no apparently praise the name of god daniel told the angel daniela [Applause] for how can the servant of my lord talk with this my lord as for me straight away there remained no strength in me neither is there a breath left in me are you concerned about your weaknesses are you concerned about your failures then you mention them to god deposit targeting you have confidence in you know the sickness i said lord jesus look what peter have mongodb pray is the name of god when they saw jesus walking on the wall yesterday on the master at first they were scared now one's all equipped and that's what the devil always does you're turning off you look at your help as something so bad they saw jesus walking on water finished that is causing storms and then jesus said it is me deeper yes peter saying no you wanna come anywhere build me come here no a pepper who was walking towards christ peter petrol was obeying the word of god to walk on water what's christ when they are crystal so his claim max we talk about you his peter was walking there's a petrol worked in bed then what the devil did people maybe brought a very high storm again will be kubwa a lot of water mainly until maybe he couldn't see jesus [Applause] but it doesn't mean that because there is darkness is [Music] water and he lost the vision of jesus he started drowning deeper and that's what the devil always does he wants you to turn your eyes from god [Applause] one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me praise the name of what was the purpose of the storms that you may
