Brother Joshua was telling me that today we only going to sing our songs we've composed from the beginning to the end. Praise the name of our Lord. We just need to learn these songs continually. Praise the name of our Lord. We want to appreciate the Sunday school of May. Thank you so much for coming even our Sunday school. Appreciate the little children and appreciate the Sunday school teachers school. You know the Bible says in Matthew chapter 21 and then I think it's verse 16 that God has perfected praise in the mouth of circling kids and babies. So for you may not understand what they are singing or maybe what they are saying but to God it is very perfect. Praise the name of so you don't mind your voice. But of course I don't mind we come and sing our songs in this voice goes this side the other one goes the other side but nonetheless you sing to the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. So we appreciate the visitors who are in our mid. You are all welcome. I want to specially introduce my sister-in-law Claudia. If you can stand up. &gt;&gt; You're welcome.

Thanks for being with us. We appreciate you being with us today. Brother William is not able to be with us. He went for some work and they couldn't release him until it is finished. But we appreciate all the effort to see that this singing goes on. Praise the name of our Lord. Now on Sunday, the coming Sunday, we are going to be hosting brother Boris. We shall have two services and we shall have a number of people join us in the services. So we need so we can prepare for that. Then this Saturday pastor simp organizing a youth meeting starting from 10:00 up to 5. So all our youth here you invited to be in K on Saturday and I would encourage you as much as possible you can go and attend meetings on Saturday. Praise the name of our Lord. So we thank God for all that he has done and we just keep on pressing on. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us stand up for scripture reading. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray before. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you again this morning the privilege you've given unto us, Lord, that we can come into your presence, Lord. And you said they shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be their peace. We pray that your peace may come in our midst. As we think about the things you're doing, as we sing about your goodness and as we receive the word, may your perfect will be done, heavenly father, bless us all together, Lord, for the glory and horn of your holy name. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and amen. Amen. Maybe before I continue there's a brother called Joseph. Has he reached? He has not yet reached. Okay. Let us go to the book of Exodus. Exodus chapter 15. We reading from verse one. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Then sung Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spoke, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider as it thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength and my song and he is become my salvation. He is my God and I will prepare him an habitation, my father's God and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war. The Lord is name and this has cast into the sea. His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea. The death have covered them. They sunk into the bottom as a storm. Thy right hand, oh Lord, is become glorious in power. hand as the enemy and the greatness of excess against the Lord says thy thy which as the prophet the sister of Aaron took in her hand and all the women went out of her house with Sing it to the Lord for he has enough. Amen. Amen. So I just want to take some time maybe 1 hour or less then we shall continue with our songs maybe for another one hour. We shall maybe break up at break up break off at 2 then at 3 we come back again. &gt;&gt; We've given the whole day to praise the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. So from the text that we have read, I want to to minister on the subject. Songs carry a message. Praise the name of the Lord. Songs carry a message. songs have a message. Praise the name of our Lord. Like we were singing this song that the children of Israel sang. You know they had just crossed the Red Sea. And you know the Red Sea was like burying everything that tormented them. All the leaders of their task masters were all drowned in the sea spiritually by the power of God. Praise the name of our Lord and sometimes we look at the stress we go through life and then we sometimes get scared of distress. But yet God has a purpose in every situation that you know he can bring that situation to an end like when the children of Israel were leaving Egypt. At first Pharaoh could not allow them to leave Egypt. He wanted to hold them bondage. You know, he wanted them to continue serving him. Until when Moses told him, "Let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness." Pharaoh sought it. They have a lot of free time. So let us give them more work. And sometimes that sometimes can come to our mind or maybe your family or your friends thinking that the time you put in the things of God, you are wasting time or you don't have what to do really. But you see God requires us to give him time. And when you come before the presence of God, he says, "Be still, be quiet." You know, be calm. Don't be in a hurry. Like when we come here in the presence of God, relax. Praise the name of our Lord. Put everything down and then be quiet there. Then allow God to come and speak to you now in the message God providing healing for this generation. Brother Brandham says he says but I want to ask you something. You know I do not know you. Now, he was in the in the prayer line. And you see, brother Brham, even other prophets or people who really wait on God, even the people that wait on the Lord. You must take your time, your precious time, and then you wait on the Lord. You don't want to be in a hurry here or a rush the other side. So now he was telling them now we just got plenty of time. Don't be in a rush. You get to rushing. The Holy Spirit is very timid. it easy and I don't want you to rush when is the service ending. Now you can imagine today we have a program of 23 songs and then your mind starts troubling. Do you mean we're going to leave this at night? Don't be in a rush. Come down. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Come down. You know if you're going to receive from the Lord, come down. Even when you have many troubles, just come down. Praise the name of the Lord. And when you are come, you can hear well. Praise the name of the Lord. You can get the right answer back. You know just that's what God wants us to do when you come into his presence here. Brother Brandham was telling them just come down wait on the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord like the way Elijah was telling Elisha if you see me taken away from you. So then all Elisha's mind was to be turned to Elijah because Elijah was strange that day. He says, "God has sent me here. When they reach there, then he say again, God has sent me here." He was wondering, but he was patient. And the Lord requires that patience with us that when you go to pray, wait on the Lord, be calm. So he says, then I want you to be deep in prayer and do this while this song is being played. Then Jesus came, &gt;&gt; delivered the maniacs. He set the captive free. &gt;&gt; He is here tonight to do the same thing. Praise the name of our Lord. So then you hear the music with, you know, a desire to understand what is this song saying. Praise the name of the Lord. Like you know the songs that have been sung. You know every song has a depth of meaning. Every song is inspired. Every song has a message it gives you. And when you take time meditating upon it, it will also change your confession. Praise the name of Lord. like brother Brham &gt;&gt; in the Brham tabernacle tabernacle. Then he went he went in the early times of his ministry when he entered the church there was a brother called I think Paul Ryder &gt;&gt; and then he was singing a song believe only believe all things are possible and then he said &gt;&gt; that's the time the angel had revealed himself to Then he said the angel was pleased about that song until that song the theme of all the revivals was moving around. It had a meaning because the Bible says only believe all things are possible. Praise the name of our Lord. And so when you have that song with you even when you are in hard conditions and then say let me get to sing to the Lord. Only believe only believe all things are possible and then your faith gets up. Praise the name of the Lord. So you don't get afraid of the stress you're going through. So songs have a message. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, you need to sing a song and that song as you sing it, it changes your feelings. Praise the name of our Lord, it changes your emotions. When we go to the scriptures, a man like Elisha, a whole prophet of God, you know, when he saw the son of Ahab coming with, you know, with, you know, another king of Israel, the man's spirit was troubled. And so now when the spirit was troubled, you know, like you know, he's disappointed like we go through some circumstances in life and then you get yourself disappointed. Sometimes you're broken down maybe of what you've heard or what you have seen like a lot in Sodom. The Bible says his righteous soul. was vexed, you know, &gt;&gt; by the things that he saw, by the things that he had. And we see we are living in Sodom and Gomorrah. We are living in an evil environment. We are we are working in an evil environment. Sometimes your neighborhood is evil. You put here your house or your residence, your neighbor is playing secular music to the top of it. So it troubles you. It vexes you. So even the prophet when you know he saw this son of Ahab, it troubled him. &gt;&gt; So his spirit was grieved. Praise the name of our Lord. And then he told them, "Bring me a mistro." Praise the name of our Lord. And now when they brought him a mistro, that's when the spirit of the Lord was able to come. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to the book of Second Kings. Second Kings chapter 3 and then verse 14. The scripture says &gt;&gt; 2 Kings 3:14 Okay, let us start from let us start from verse 10. &gt;&gt; And the king of Israel said, "Alas, the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab. But Joseph had said, "Is there not here a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by him?" And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, "Here is Elisha, the son of Shafett, which poured water on the hands of Elijah. And Joshua said, "The word of the Lord is with him." So the king of Israel and the king of Edom went to him. said unto the king of Israel, "What have I to do with you? Get the prophet and the prophet your mother." And the king of Israel said unto him, "Nigh, for the Lord has delivered things together to deliver them into the hand of Mo. as the Lord. Surely were it not that I prese nor you know he felt hurt saying why don't you go to the to the prophets of your father why don't you go there why do you come to us so then that made him troubled And brother Brandham calls it, &gt;&gt; he got righteous indignation. You know, and so now the spirit of God would not work in that kind of environment because he was upset. And so now even you see in the first quote we read when brother Brandham would be in the prayer line, he would tell the people, "Come down. Don't walk up and down, coming in, going out. He said you upset the Holy Spirit. In other words, you hindered the Holy Spirit from going further to move and there are some situations also in our lives that can hinder the work of God in our lives or in the things that we are doing. So now here was the prophet anointed of God. But then he was upset, you know, he was troubled and the prophet knew that the spirit of God cannot work in that kind of way. Praise the name of God. Like when people were coming to the prayer line, brother Brandham would tell them, "Come down." But now when you look at some of these televisions, when somebody's coming, they're scared, they are shaking, and then they wave their hand, they fall. That's not how the Holy Spirit works. Praise the name of our Lord. He wants you to come down. Listen. So the the prophet then he knew how to get back into the spirit. Praise the name of the Lord and see how the prophet told them. Verse 15. But now bring me a mistro. And it came to pass when the mist plague that the hand of the Lord came upon him. Praise the name of Lord. That's why it is important for us to come to church early enough that you can hear the mro playing. You can be part of the song service. Then those demons that trouble you about your debts will go away. Praise the name of you have enough faith. These days are not anything before me. Why? Because the spirits have gone away. Those demons that trouble you maybe at home, at a place of work, they will go away. And you know when brother Brandham was discerning the demons would manifest themselves like darkness darkness. So you would see the whole groom darkness all over and then he tries to press through giving some testimony giving something. The darkness starts reducing and then he sees a light somewhere in one corner and then he gets further into that to increase the faith of the people and as he keeps on pressing on. You see the darkness has gone away. The whole place is white milky. Then he says now faith is here. Then he tells everybody you are here. If you know you are sick, raise up on your feet and stand. Even people who come from the wheelchairs, everybody was standing rejoicing because of the power of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. And even when we come to church, we need to come for deliverance. We need to come. If there is distress troubling you, there is this demon that bothers me, let it be released from you. Praise the name of Lord. So when they played the mistro, the spirit of the Lord came down upon the prophet. And then he was able to see the mind of God. And whenever we come to church, let us come. Lord, I've come to learn your counsel. I've come to know your mind. There's something troubling me at place of work. There's something troubling me at home. There's something troubling me at my my my life. Lord, help me to know your will. So when you come, come to be delivered. Praise the name of our Lord. So when they play the music, the Holy Spirit came back. Even King Saul, the Bible says he had an evil spirit in 1st Samuel 16:14. And then verse 14, but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him. And Saul's servant said unto him, "Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles you." Amen. Let our Lord now command thy servants which are before you to seek out a man who is cunning player of a harp, a mistro. And it came to pass when the evil spirit from God is upon you that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the name of Lord. Troubled by an evil spirit. You may also be troubled with different things. But here the Bible says get the right music the demons will leave the name of maybe at your home. You come back from work so troubled so down. Put on your music. You know the people of the world they have music that consoles them. They go in their funny things there you know and the world have particular music but the music which mostly the world music about women. Somebody playing. Then there's another one who sang a music about being disappointed. I'm tired, &gt;&gt; different musics and then there are people &gt;&gt; who now put that music on their status. &gt;&gt; It may not be music, it may be a photo. a message. &gt;&gt; How could you do this? &gt;&gt; They put it there on the status. &gt;&gt; You know, music has a message. &gt;&gt; Now, the music that can bring us deliverance should be the music that is focused on God. Praise the name of God. Music that is praising God. Music that is bringing back the scriptures to you. Music that's taking you into worship. Music that brings you into the presence of God. Like Elisha said, "Come and play to me." You know David had written many psalms. So now they would come and start playing those songs. And when they start playing those songs, then the Holy Spirit would come down. And when the Holy Spirit comes down, the station changes. So he had David was anointed by God. He had a skill. Praise the name of Lord. So when he started playing, you know, the demons that were on Saul, they left him and then he was relieved. Praise the name of our Lord. You even see that the systems of the world, you know, like in in the security forces, all different organizations, they have a band, you know, they have kind of like a department of music, you know, it encourages them when they going to work. Then they can sing and sing and sing and then fear goes away. Where they are going is not walking in a parking. No, there is death. But they go there with courage because of the singing that they sing. Praise the name of our Lord. Now if those things can help them naturally, how about us spiritually? Praise the name of our Lord. No wonder the Bible says praise the name of our Lord that you know sing a song. The Bible says is there anybody sick? Pray. Is there anybody Mary? Sing a psalm. Praise the name of our Lord. Sing sweet melody unto the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. So when David started playing Saul was relieved. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to verse 21. The Bible says, "And David came to Saul and stood before him, and he loved him greatly, and he became his army armbbearer." And Saul sent to Jesus, saying, "Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight." And it came to pass when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul that David took an harp and played with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and well, and the evil spirit departed from him. Praise the name of our Lord. When he had the song, he was praise the name of our Lord. Take time. Listen to this message. the message in the song. Play these songs over and over. Meditate upon them. That's how their impact will come down in your life. Praise the name of our Lord. Maybe you are playing them maybe at your place of work. Now I don't mean maybe you are an officer. So you put your loud music. I want all of them to know &gt;&gt; it's not that there are systems that can make you have that music. Listen to yourself. Amen. Without somebody saying you are interfering. Praise the name of the Lord. Take time listen to it on your journeys. Take time listen to it at home. Take time listen to it. Why don't you learn them yourself? Praise the name of the Lord. You know you learn it by heart. Amen. And then when some comes then the mind is able to recall and then you start singing that song. Sometimes you can sing it in your heart, you know, it has an impact in your life. Praise the name of you. You may not be able to get another singer to move with you or praise the name of our Lord. Or you say, Joshua, let us be moving with you and you sing for me. Praise the name of our Lord. But we have recorded voices. Praise the name of our Lord. So you get that voice, declare it, you are moving. Praise the name of our Lord. And you know music can bring souls to Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. They can draw people to Christ. You know music like we have seen here casts out demons. &gt;&gt; It casts out demons. Music can bring healing. Praise the name of the Lord. It does a lot. Praise the name of our Lord. Like in Kenya, some of the farms there, dairy farms, when they want to get more milk from the cow, they go and play some sweet music there for the cow. And they milk and the cow gives more milk. praise the name of our Lord. How about us? Like if you have troubles at home, put good music to cast those demons of complaining all the time. Every day we don't have sugar and then you learn how to survive without sugar. But not that's not to say if you're a husband &gt;&gt; and the wife is telling you I want sugar then you put the symbol if you have little children at home they may not listen to your songs but Music has an impact. It brings a change. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Psalms 137. &gt;&gt; Psalm 137. Praise the name of our Lord. These were children of Israel. They were in Babylon. And then the the captures they started telling them we want to hear of the songs of Zion. You see what their testimony was. Praise the name of our Lord. Psalms 137 verse one says, "By the rivers of Babylon, where there we sat down, yeah, we wept, we remembered Zion, You know they were taken in captivity and then they remembered the worship in the temple mount. How I wish I was back to the temple. Praise the name of our Lord. How I wish I was there, you know, to hear the music being sung. Until the Bible says when Solomon was dedicating the temple and then they were singing the musicians were one voice and then they were singing songs of praise. We can pick that scripture and then we come back to this. Praise the name of our Lord in 2 Coronicles chapter 5 and then verse 13. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one's sound be heard in praising and thanking the Lord. When they lifted up their voice with trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praised the Lord, saying, "For he is good, for his mercy endures forever." &gt;&gt; That the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Verse 13, &gt;&gt; chapter 5, verse 13. Second Chronicles. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! Praise the name of the Lord. The Bible says they sung as one. Praise the name of the Lord. You know you may be gifted but your gift needs to be polished. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. You know like the singing we are singing today songs we are receiving today is not something that has come only one day. It has taken time. working upon it, working upon it. Praise the name of our Lord. And if you even you when you want to be perfected in your gift, you need to exercise it. You need to put it to testing. You're not going to get get an instrument and then just start playing it. and I can just get God has the way he works out. Praise the name of the Lord. He has a way how he works out. He gives you the skill, but the skill also develops. Praise the name of the Lord. It grows. It must be trained. And to be trained, to be tutored, you must be humble. And to work as a group, to be in harmony with others, it takes humility. Praise the name of Allah. I can't sing with them. Then there's something wrong with it. Praise the name of It takes discipline. Like in football matches, you get some of these good talents. But if they don't have discipline to work with others, that gift is no good. Praise the name of our Lord. They give you the ball. You You want to show that you're the only person on the football team. I'm greater than them. &gt;&gt; Take one. Put here the ball. Put the ball. &gt;&gt; And you know some stations when people are doing as a group some want to grab the mic from others and then when they moving working as a group maybe you have one mic the other wants to personalize it. not seeing the voices come together to that. So there should be discipline. There should be you know bearing with one another. Praise the name of our Lord not an issue of competition. I'm better if I was not there nothing would happen. No, you just humble yourself and thank God. If you are better than another person, support them to go together. Praise the name of the Lord. How you can move together, how you can improve. Praise the name of our Lord because every joint has to supply. But if it's only your joint supply, the impact will be less. But if every joint can supply, praise the name of our Lord, it will be very glorious. So they had to sing in harmony. And the Bible says when it was only one voice and God was pleased with it, then the glory of God came to praise the name of Lord. And that's the harmony that we should have in our lives. in our families, even us as a church, we need to have that harmony. Praise the name of Lord. Praise the name of our Lord that everything may be done, led of the spirit of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go back to Psalms 137. The Bible says, "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down." Yeah, we wept when we remembered Zion. upon the willows in the midst thereof. Now you can imagine they were in sorrow, they were in bondage but then the music were not being played. They were not playing. They were not singing. What a gloomy condition that is. We shouldn't allow that to happen in our lives where the devil completely binds you until there's nothing good. You see, praise the name of the Lord. Don't allow your life to get to such a condition and then you just have the yesterday. You know last brother S's family song has a song about years you know seeing you know how can we get things better praise the name of our Lord. So we need to see we don't get into this condition. You are in captivity. You are bound. Even your hop is hung there. You come to church you are bound. When the song leader says let us rise up and sing. Why is he disturbing us? Want to see it? &gt;&gt; What a terrible condition. But get in the spirit here. The song leader is led by the spirit like a Miriam was leading the women and then she got the timber and then all the women followed up. Praise the name of the Lord. We need to get into the spirit of worship. When we come here to church, praise the name of our Lord. If you have been disappointed somewhere, when you come to church, I have come to worship. Praise the name of the Lord. I have come to worship the Lord. Whether I don't have a job or I have a job, I have come to worship the Lord. Whether I have food at home or I don't have food at home, I have come to worship the Lord. Whether I'm sick, I'm not sick, I have come to worship the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord. And the Bible says, "Let the weak say. I am strong." Praise the name of our Lord. It's a positive confession. I don't want to hang my when I'm in a church. I don't want to keep my mouth quiet when I'm in the presence of the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord. So you get into the spirit. Praise the name of the Lord. Don't allow the devil to start troubling you. You what you are singing, you don't know. No. Praise the name of the Lord. You know, like the song which was sung, it's the blood &gt;&gt; that atones for our souls. And brother Brandham teaches us that the blood is the word. So when we come in the presence of God, there is enough blood to wash us from all unrighteousness. Now the devil can tell you. Last night you did this and this. Last week you did something. When you come into the presence of God, allow that blood to wash. Praise the name of the Lord. Be cleansed. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. When Isaiah was in his presence, he identified his sin. Oh Lord, my lips. He confessed it. And then he got the cleansing. And we have enough cleansing right here. Praise the name over. Say, Lord, wash me. Lord, wash me. Lord make me whole. Praise the name of our Lord. So the Bible says they hung their hops. And then they said in verse three, for they are they that carried us away captive required us a song. And they said, they that wasted us, required us of mass, saying, sing unto us one of the songs of Zion. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? Praise the name of our Lord. They were wondering, "We are captives. We are bound. Then these people are telling us to sing unto them." And this is what the world is doing. They want to get the Lord song and sing it in a strange place. They want to get a song like when they having their discos the whole nightclubs. Maybe they have drunk too much. They have danced too much. They are very tired. They are disappointed. Then they want to put on a song &gt;&gt; and they put them in the morning around 3, four, five there after doing all the dirty things that they just like that. You know, you hear them in the places where we live when there is a when they are going to have maybe a party the following day, maybe an introduction or what. So the whole night is playing funny music. Now at around 3 4 then they want to sing the Lord song in a strange place. That's what the world is. They want to sing the Lord's song in a strange place just trying to soo themselves to take gospel music in our way. &gt;&gt; Then they put on Jes and they can keep on dancing. &gt;&gt; They have that music that soothes them in that kind of area. But if you get real anointed music, You know the Bible says that the prostitutes they also have a song. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to the book of Isaiah chapter 23. And then verse 15. And it shall come to pass in that day that Tyra shall be forgotten seven years according to the days of one king. After the end of seven years shall Tyra sing a song as a hallot. Take an h, go about the city, though harot that has been forgotten, make sweet melody, sing many songs that you may be remembered. So they have their songs and they said they sing to be remembered. Yeah. One composed that song. Don't you remember? And those songs. &gt;&gt; Now if music can cast out demons, Music can bring demons into your life. What song are you listening to? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. What do you like? Because these songs have spirits. They carried demons. You get a song of some of these pop stars, the demons just get a hold of you. Like you get little children now, they can dance around, roll, break dance. They want to act like a chameleon. One is on the back, one is on the legs, one is doing this. You know, so many styles, so many things. But the message in the songs, the message in the songs we should listen to should be Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. Not praising some woman, not praising some politician, not praising your place of work, but praising the Lord. That should be our message in the songs that we listen. Praise the name of our Lord. And that will bring deliverance, to bring healing, it will increase your faith. Praise the name of our Lord, music that has God as the theme. Praise the name of Lord. Now, just as I finish, let me read this quote. In the message Christ the mystery of God revealed. Brother Brandham says now he was saying that all psalms and all the prophets spoke of him. Well, there therefore that shows the all the Old Testament, all of the New Testament, and all of the psalms, the singing, the songs that we sang, we are sung of him. Praise the name of our Lord. That's the music we should desire to listen to. Those are the songs you desire to listen to. something that brings Christ before you. Praise the name of Lord. Then he says, take Psalm 22 and sing it and compare it with the morning of crucifixion. See, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me? All my bones stare at me. They pierced my feet and my hands. Yet all those things there them singing the psalm down there in the temple and crucifying the very one. those great religious leaders, those great men, those great teachers, and they were so blinded that was reading the prophets and singing the songs and doing the same crime that they said they would do. How strange it is. Praise the name of our Lord. So we need songs with a message and let that message become real to our lives. When I'm singing only believe, let that be my confession. Lord, I believe. Lord, I receive. Lord, I accept. Praise the name of our Lord. Let the music bring such praise the name of our Lord. I sing it in my heart. I testify about the goodness of the Lord. Transformation in my life. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Ephesians chapter 5 and then verse 18. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says, "And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled with the spirit." Ephesians 5:18. So, &gt;&gt; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. Now he says speaking to yourself. In other words, you are speaking to yourself. How do you speak to yourself? You have maybe some trouble and now you can speak to yourself and then now you have some trouble and then you remember not by power, not by might but by my spirit. You get it? whose spirit God is spirit not my strength not my ability in the trouble that I'm going through but by the spirit of God I know who knows yourself you're speaking to yourself I know that this mountain &gt;&gt; shall be moved it's a song but as you sing it. You are speaking to yourself. You are confessing it. Praise the name of our Lord. Each of us has that liberty. Praise the name of our Lord. Maybe you are in trespasses, too much. Then you remember the song. There is a fountain. You are speaking to yourself. There is a you know you sing it and then you know the the song when you look at it he went through different phases. I just want to look at the different paragraphs on this song 54. He first confesses there is a fountain from Emmanuel's vein. And then he says sinners, he opens the door to everybody. Then he starts testifying. There was a dying thief. Now you can imagine a dying thief finding that fountain. How about you? Then he says again the dying lamp. Then he says, "Ever since by faith and then he confesses to himself, praise the name of our Lord how that fountain can bring me to deliverance." So the Bible is saying, speaking to yourselves, you yourself speaking to yourself the situation you are going through. Get that song that matches your condition and sing it. Praise the Lord about it. Tell God he cannot overcome this condition. Praise the name of Allah. So he says speaking to yourself in psalms, in hymns, spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart unto the Lord. Praise the name of those demons go away. Fear goes away. This changes. Why? Singing a spiritual song. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he says, "Giving thanks always all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. We thank God. We have many songs spiritually inspired that we can sing to ourselves and the environment changes the atmosphere changes in Colossians 3:15 the Bible says and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which also you are called in one body and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. Praise the name of the Lord. Everything we do in the name of the Lord. Do in the word of God. All our songs that we need to listen to, let them be about the word of God. What the Lord has done. Praise the name of God. the things that the Lord is promising to do to us. Praise the name of our Lord. So songs must have a message. Praise the name of our Lord. And even as singing, take time, listen to that message in the song. Not only enjoying the melod, not only enjoying how everything is going on. I like the arrangement. I like the way she dressed up. I liked this. You're missing the message. Get that song. Let it bring a message in your heart. Praise the name of our Lord. And that one will always live with you and will help you in the time of need. Amen. May God bless you so much. Amen. Amen. I just want to invite brother Joshua. Praise the name of our lord. There is that song brother Joshua su says is it I will sing a song. I will sing a what is it? So that's why I sing.

It means that you have defeated the enemy and you've overcome and you are a victor holding victory and we sing songs and share a victory. When you you have a trial or a test, it shows the grace of God has found as you have found favor with God and God believes that you stand the test. When it looks like everything is gone wrong, God is giving you a trial. He's got confidence in you. You don't have to baby you around. You are not a hot bed plant hybrid. You are a real Christian. God is giving you a test to see that to see what you will do about it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The song is titled I have victory. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Mech and a story of victory. Victory in itself. He showed himself my dear. As the fourth man in the fire, there is victory in the Lord. When Daniel was Daniel, born in the lion's den, having sweet fellowship instead of judgment, a reminder of God's faithfulness that he will bring you out. There is victory in the Lord. There is victory. So much victory in the lamb of Calvary. are crucified. Oh God, give up me daily. I'm part in his wings. I have victory in the Lord.

I found victory. Jesus has given me victory. song is by brother Joshua sorry brother Mesa and uh it is titled destiny choices. So he picks his inspiration from the message the choosing of the bride 1965 from paragraph 31. Amen. So as the brother steps up, let me take Oh, you're going God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm quoting from the choosing of a bride paragraph 31. In many things of life, we are given a choice. The way of life itself is a choice. We have a right to make our own way, choose our own way that we want to live. Right and wrong is a choice. Every man, every woman, boy and girl has to has to choose whether they are going to try to live right or not to live right. It's a choice. Choice is a great thing. Your eternal destination is a choice. And maybe tonight some of you will make that choice of where you will spend eternity. Before this service ends, there will be one time that if you turn if you turned God down many times, there will be one time you turn him down the last time. There is a line between mercy and judgment. And it's danger. It's a dangerous thing for a man or woman, boy or girl, to step across that line. &gt;&gt; For there is no return when you step across that line. So tonight, it may be the time that many will make their decision where they will spend their endless eternity. &gt;&gt; God We are given a choice to live or to die. to follow the path that leads to the sky. Oh, to wonder in darkness without the light. The decision is ours. They are none. In many things of life we are given a choice. The way of life itself is a choice. We have a right to choose life for all day. have a right to choose heaven or hell. Choose life. Choose love. Choose the way that leads to life. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus is the way, the truth and life. Oh, before you stand right and wrong, they unaware of Satan's way. The choice is yours to make. Decide tonight. Choose love. Choose love. Choose the way. There is no Jesus is the way, the truth, and life. Before you stand right and wrong, eternal sat. Oh, the choice is yours to make his eyes tonight. God made us free moral agents in life to choose between the good and bad like in for Adam and Eve. He say that the tree of knowledge or the tree of life to choose and the choice they made affected the human race. God made us free moral agency in life to choose between the good and bad like he made for Adam and Eve. and say that the tree of knowledge or the tree of life to choose and the choice they made affected the human race.

There was a man one time who was a believer. He had been dead four days. He was in the grave stinking, rotten, but heard the voice of God speak. Lazarus, come forth." And if if it brought a man forth after being dead and rotten, what ought it to do to a church that still has life in it? It ought resurrect them in the mess of all of these voices that we've talked about, religious, politics, Hollywood, all the false prophecies and things that's gone out. In the midst of all of all of it, the true voice of God will call a man that is dead in sin and trespasses to life again. It ought to take a basian church and call it to life again. Sure. Amen.

So we shall simply pick out an extract of that sermon uh and we shall listen it where she picks her inspiration. May God bless you. The last one comes in. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take very long. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know him. &gt;&gt; He was that man that was hanging at the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a man, how do you call him? We call him the sheer.

Lord, I wasn't there when you met up with the tempter and said, "Have you seen my serant? and set me to the test. Oh, all I see is pain as my word crumbles down. And they whisper, "You can't make it. Just cast Gordon D. I may not understand when you hand me to the tempter. When I'm walking through the fire. Oh, drowning in life scares. I may not understand. when you take the ones I love. But Lord, even when you slay me, still I trust you. &gt;&gt; I really didn't know. that you are testing my faith when you said take your only son and give him for a sacrifice. Lord, how could I understand that you only sought obedience and with God's provided way, he gave a lamb for sacrifice. Oh, I may not understand when you hand me to the tempter. When I'm walking through the fire. Oh, drowning in life scares. Lord, I may not understand when you take the ones I love. But Lord, even when you slay me, still will I trust you. Joseph was betrayed by the ones who should have loved him most. and Hosea had to your to someone deemed unworthy. No, they didn't understand the purpose of their heartache. Their lives were just a small time of your redeeming love. Lord, I may not understand when you hand me to the temper. When I'm walking through the fire. Oh, drowning in life scares. Oh, I may not understand. Oh, and you take the ones I love. Lord, even when you slay me, still will I trust you. I face Goliath down. I went in the name of Jesus. Oh, in the den of hungry lions, I saw your perfect love. And when I face the fire, I'm sure of your will. There was a fourth man in the fire and he delivered me again. Lord, I may not understand. I may not see it to the temp. Oh, and I'm walking through the fire. &gt;&gt; Through the fire. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord, when I'm drowning, &gt;&gt; drowning in life, &gt;&gt; Lord, I may not understand it.

Still will I trust you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I may not understand when you hand me the tempter, but still I'll trust in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's have uh eyes on you by by sister OJ Victor Esther and she picks her inspiration from Matthew 14 and uh brother Martin will read that scripture Matthew 28-31 and Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water." And he said, "Come." And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried, saying, "Lord, save me." And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, "Oh, thou of little faith, wherefore did thou doubt?" God bless you. Help me when I'm sinking. Help me keep my eyes on you. When my faith is winging, when I can't keep on standing, scared by waves, you reach your hand to me. So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Even when the storm is out, you're the anchor that I cling to when my fears are pulling me down. You're the only one who says the only truth that never fades. So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Keep my eyes on you. Keep my eyes on you, Lord. Even when the storm is loud, you're the anchor that I cling to when my faith are pulling me down. You're the only one who says, the only truth that never fades. So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Keep my eyes on you. When the work of the walls felt impossible and high. When I was mocked for listening when you when they laughed and spoke against him tried to check his heart and spirit knew his eyes were fixed and he kept building through it all. So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Even when the storm is loud. You're the anchor that I cling to. When my face are pulling me down. You're the only one who says, the only truth that never fad. So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Keep my eyes on you. When the fire was lit and the king gave his command, when the three children refused to bow and no even in the flames they trusted a forth came and walked alone, you did not disappoint. The eyes never turned away. So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Even when the storm is loud. You're the anchor that I cling to. When my fears are pulling me down, you're the only one who says, the only truth I never fail. So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Keep my eyes on you. Keep my eyes on you, Lord. Even when the storm is loud. You're the anchor that I came to. When my fears are pulling me down, you're the only one who says, the only truth that never fades. So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Keep my eyes on you. You're the only one who saves, &gt;&gt; the only truth that never fails. So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Keep my eyes on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep my eyes on you. That's everyone's prayer &gt;&gt; that the Lord may keep our eyes on him. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the regs of troubles, let him keep our eyes on him. Amen. So, let's have uh sister Karen with I believe and she picks in from Hebrews and Mark and I'll invite brother Silas to come and read out her inspiration. Amen. Hebrews 11 verse 6. But without faith it is impossible to please God, to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Then Mark 9 supposed to read from 17 to 24 but uh we skipped Psalm. There was a man who brought his child to Jesus who was suffering from an evil spirit. And we'll read the last two verses. Jesus said unto him, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth." &gt;&gt; And straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears, "Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief. God bless you. My heart is full of uncertainty. And all I see is h. But I know that you care for me. So dear Lord save me. I believe. Lord, I believe. Please help my belie. Check my heart, Lord. Check my heart and remove any doubt. I believe, Lord, I believe. Please help my eyes believe. Oh, shake my heart. Lord, shake my heart and remove any doubt. I'm sinking in the deep ocean. You never make it is all I hear. Oh my Lord. I know you're standing by. Stretch your hand out to me. Oh, &gt;&gt; I believe Lord I believe. Please help my take my heart my heart and remove it all my Lord. I believe. &gt;&gt; Oh, please help my believe. &gt;&gt; Shake my heart, Lord. Lord, shake my hands for the glory. Glory, glory, glory, holy God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sinking in that deep portion of it. You never make it is all I hear. Oh my Lord, I know you're standing by. Stretch your hand out to me. I believe, Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Please help me. Oh, &gt;&gt; shake my heart. Lord, shake my heart and remove any doubt. &gt;&gt; I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe. Lord, I believe. Help my heart believe. Shake my heart, Lord. Shake my heart and remove any doubt. Oh, I believe Lord, I believe. Please remove any doubt. Amen. I believe and God says I know. Amen. So I believe from Sister Karen. And the next song baby with parental care. But God said that his love was elective love. The proof of his love is election. And no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that by the fact they were chosen unto salvation. Because God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. He may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative. He is sovereign but it is all with a purpose. &gt;&gt; Why does he stand by? The reason is in Romans 8 chapter 8 verse 17 to 18. And if children then hes of God and joint hes with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also glorify together. For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. Unless we suffer with him, we cannot reign with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God says, "I know." And God says, "I know. I know all that you're going through. &gt;&gt; My grace to you in all is sufficient." And he says, "I know. I know it's all working out for good. Be still, my child, and know that I am God." And he says, "I know." When God says, "I know." Ooh, I know all that you're going through. &gt;&gt; My grace to you in all is sufficient. My grace to you in all is sufficient. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I know." when he says I know I know it's all working out for you. Be still my child and know. Oh, &gt;&gt; be still my child and know that I am love. through the body of oppression like Joseph. He says I know &gt;&gt; Shadrach Me ago thrown in the fire. &gt;&gt; I know. Oh, he can hold back the plagues and the suffering. For Job some came through painful moments of trial and humility &gt;&gt; through the valley. All through the valley of oppression like Joseph, &gt;&gt; he says, "I know." &gt;&gt; He says, "I know." Even when you're in the valley of oppression, Shadrach, Meak, Abednego in the fire. &gt;&gt; He doesn't rush even when he knows you are in the fire. Oh, he can hold back the plagues and the suffering. But for Job, some came through. Painful moments of trial and humility. God says, "I know." &gt;&gt; Friends, God says, "I know." Oh, and God says, "I know. I know all that you're going through. &gt;&gt; My grace to you. &gt;&gt; My grace to &gt;&gt; to you. &gt;&gt; My grace to you. We know sufficient. &gt;&gt; His grace is sufficient. No matter the circumstance. Oh, when he says, "I know." Oh, I know. It's all working out for good. &gt;&gt; Just be still and know that he is God. Oh, &gt;&gt; be still, my child, and know that I am God. &gt;&gt; See, God is a God of purpose. Oh, see, God is a God of purpose. lest he would be frustrating us. But he has a great plan. Through it he unfolds his great plan. For his ways are higher than ours. Oh, he molds me through the darkest trials. With these good thoughts, my redeemer refineses me. Character training, character training and molding to bring me to an expected end. See God, oh see God is our God. hope lest he would be frustrating us. Oh, in it he unfolds his great plans for his ways they are higher than us. Slowly molds me through the darkest trials. With these good thoughts, my redeemer refineses a character training. Character training and holding to bring me to an expected end. Can we go higher? When God says, "I know. I know. I know." Oh, God. You're glorying and my grace to you. &gt;&gt; My grace, &gt;&gt; my grace to you in all the finishes. He says, "I know. I know. I know. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; It's all I for. Just be still, my child. &gt;&gt; Be still. &gt;&gt; Be still, &gt;&gt; my child. &gt;&gt; And know that I am God. &gt;&gt; I just want to sing with you together. Just the drums. God says I know. Come on. &gt;&gt; God says I know. I know. all that you're going through. &gt;&gt; He knows, brother, sister, he knows what you're going through. And my grace to you in all is sufficient. He says, &gt;&gt; and he says, I know, I know it's all working out for still my child. &gt;&gt; He's still my child. &gt;&gt; I know that I am. &gt;&gt; God says, "I know." Just one more time. He says, "I know." God says, "I know. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; I know all that you're going through." &gt;&gt; And my grace to you. &gt;&gt; My grace, &gt;&gt; my grace, &gt;&gt; you know sufficient. &gt;&gt; He says, "I know." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I know. Oh, I know. So, I'll be out your &gt;&gt; Be still my child. &gt;&gt; Be still my child and know that I am born. &gt;&gt; Oh, be still my child and know. Be still my child and know that I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he says. Going through a valley. Are you going through a valley or a storm? He says, "I know." &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you having any troubles in life? He says, I know. And if God be for us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? Amen. That's such a wonderful sermon. Amen. We notice that every one of these songs is a sermon. &gt;&gt; It's an encouragement on its own. Amen. And really thank God for such inspirations. We have the next song from Brother Joshua Mesa. Um we cut we brother Joshua and um uh he picks his inspiration from Romans 12 1-2 and 1 Thessonians 5 17-21. May God bless you as ministers. I beseech you brethren by the mercies of God. Present your body as a living sacri and acceptable to God. Let that be your duty and the reason never. I beseech you breed by the mercies of God. Praise your body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God. Let that be your duty and the reason neighbors are. Be ye not conformed to the systems of this one, but be truly transformed by the new of your mind. Do what is good and acceptable to God. Dwell in peace with all men. That's the perfect will of God. I receive your brethren by the meries of God. Praise your body as a living sacriable to God. Let that be your duty and the reason. Let your heart rejoice in the Lord ever more.

Praise your body as a living sacriice. Glory and acceptable to God. Let that be your duty and the reason we let that be your duty and the reason may your Amen. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8-7 and 2 Corinthians chapter 12. Sister Faith got the inspiration to write the song Redeeming Grace. And she also draws her inspiration from the message preached by uh pastor Andreas. The bride has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; The bride has made herself ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we shall listen to a clip of this message and thereafter the sister will present the song &gt;&gt; that he worthy. When the last one comes in, when the last one comes in, it doesn't take very long. &gt;&gt; Remember, as we go there a little later, &gt;&gt; 2,000 years ago, there was already a last one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know him. &gt;&gt; He was that man &gt;&gt; that was hanging at the cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a man. How do you call him? We call him the sheh. There man that was hanging at the cross with Jesus together. Is that right? With Jesus together. There was someone hanging with him. And one said, "Hey, if you are the son of God, help us do something. Help us from the cross. Do it yourself. The other one said, &gt;&gt; "What?" The other one said, "Hey, he deserved our punishment. We have done wrong in our life. We have deserved our punishment. Has done nothing. But is it all about attitude?" And then he is asking. &gt;&gt; He's asking He's asking can I find grace, remember me. Remember me when you come into your kingdom. Jesus turned around. And he said, "Today, today you will be with me in paradise." Is that right? What did this man do &gt;&gt; to go? He said there was among you when he said my wretched soul. Oh, when he left the 99, the gentle shepherd was seeking me. I am the prodigal that he led back home. He simply saved me because of his love. But for the grace of God, I would be lost. But for the grace of God, I'd be the cheapest of sin. But for his grace, his love and his power. All that I am, every breath that I take is simply by grace. But for the grace of God, I would be lost. But for the grace of God, I'd be the cheapest of s. for his grace, his love and his power. All that I am, every breath that I take is simply by grace. Grace takes over. When love protests, there is nothing I could have done to deserve his mercy. Just be sure that your unbelief. Oh, it can't hinder God. Just look to the promise. is not the way that you feel. It's only by grace for the grace of God. &gt;&gt; But for his grace, &gt;&gt; I would be lost. But for the grace of God, I be the chief that stops s for his grace. His love and his power. All that I am, every breath that I take is simply by grace. Elective love that is my potion. Oh, I've caught my rapturing faith because he said it is finished. Oh yes, I am righteous because of his righteousness and the right attitude. Lord be done to me only by grace but for his grace. Oh, I want to be so Lord &gt;&gt; for the grace of God, &gt;&gt; but for his grace, &gt;&gt; but for his grad for his &gt;&gt; Oh, but for his power, &gt;&gt; all that I am, &gt;&gt; all that I am, &gt;&gt; all that I am, &gt;&gt; that is simply by graduate. &gt;&gt; Oh my for the grace of God for the praise. &gt;&gt; We achieve our sing. Oh, for your grace, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you for grace, Lord. &gt;&gt; All that I am, all that I am, &gt;&gt; all that I am simply my for his grace, his love and his power. All that I am, every breath that I take is &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For we are a product of grace. Amen. And it's by grace that we are all saved. &gt;&gt; Without grace, where would we be? It has to be grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of grace, he says, because he said, "It is finished. I am righteous." Because of his righteousness, the right attitude is Lord be it unto me and that settles it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so because of his grace, he loves you. He loves me. And so the next song from Sister Mambbo Faith says you love me. Without grace, he would not find me and would not love me. Amen. May the Lord bless you. You have called me by my name. My name is inscribed in your palms. You embrace me like a little child. You say I am yours. You say I'm complete. You impress me with your love. You love me. You &gt;&gt; love me. &gt;&gt; Lord, you have called me by my name. &gt;&gt; Love me. &gt;&gt; Lord, you have chosen me as your own. &gt;&gt; Love me, &gt;&gt; Lord. You love me. You love me, Lord. There is no greater love than this. That one would lay down his life and pay it all for a friend. With an everlasting love says you're the upper of my eye, my beloved, you are mine. You love me. You love me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, you love me. You &gt;&gt; love me, &gt;&gt; Lord. You have chosen me. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, you love me. &gt;&gt; You love me, Lord. &gt;&gt; You were nailed to the cross. gave your life to wretched soul all the way to Calvary you went with mercy in your eyes with grace you looked at me and poured out your love I love you Lord cause you fall. Oh Lord, I love you. Lord, I love you. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh. Oh. Yes. Oh, anal. Oh, she get Oh yes. Oh yes. No one guessing. Oh yes. Oh yeah. One full time. Oh yes. Qualing is a much. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh. Oh yes. Oh yes. Wow. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He loves you. He loves me. And we are here tonight because he loves us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he called us by his name. That's so wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's have a personal experience. A song inspired from first kings chapter 10 verse9 Matthew 16:13-17 Judges 13 verse 3-5 Judges 16 17- 21 and chapter 28 verse from 28-30 then Exodus chapter 2 and chapter 3 and also from the message the experience with and a personal experience with God preached 19 54 uh and we shall have brother Sam read out a few lines from that message and this song was written by sister Ruth Oangi and I think she'll also be singing it. Amen. And now Moses had been a bitter failure. But out there we see his attention attracted to the burning bush. and he looks to the burning bush to find out what the trouble was and walking close to it. Fire usually brings an attraction usually the Holy Spirit when it comes in a manner of fire attracts the attention of the people. And when Moses turned aside to consider this burning tree that would not burn up, God spoke to him aresh a vision by an angel. Now watch faith take a hold right quick. The old things are passed away. But Moses now has a new vision. He has a revelation. He has an experience. He had met God. He had talked to God. Before that he had not met God. He had only read and know what his mother had told him by hearing what his mother had said and hearing what the pastor had said. But now Moses has a personal experience. God bless. Bless you. An angel came to Manua's wife said you will bear a son from the womb deliveries will come. She kept the vow, raised him right, did all she was told. But Samson took his gift for granted. Training secrets grow his love to the let her cut his glory down. Light and shade between two pillars. It is darkness finally bound. And I have peace of seding what was blessed in me. It was once but never caught what I was called to be. I need a personal experience. I need to know it for myself. The stories that they told me could never be enough. It is pain. I'm reaching for the Lord. I need to know you more. a basket on the river's bed. She knew her son was chosen but could not see the end. He grew up in the palace of the wisdom of the land. But when he moved without a vision, blood was on his hand and waiting till a few shiny answer. It was a time to rise. I've been in my own desert wondering far from the cold. I've heard they had no but that is not all. I need to find some noise and experience. I need to know you for myself. The stories that they told me could never be enough. Pick me up the body. Like you met him in the days. I'm standing on holy ground. But I need to meet you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The stories of the king and all his pain, but she crossed the desert to go and see the gate firsthand. She stood before his throne. She said the heart was never told. What she witnessed for herself was one more walk beside the master. I didn't teach and watch the but when he said you are the Christ heaven made it real. So I'm done with second heart f like a queen have come to see like little go revelation father but I speak to me I need a spirit I need to know you for myself the stories they told me. You never be enough. Leave me in the secret place. Reveal yourself to me. I'm a living de. Give me a pass and not experience. I want to know you for myself. Not my mama's present. Lord, I need you to reveal yourself. Beats me in my midnight hour like sun in his sh from my eyes. Lord, I need to know you more. I just need to know you more. &gt;&gt; I just need to know you more. Give me a personal experience with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a sermon. &gt;&gt; The preachers have preached, the teachers have taught, but each one of us needs to have a personal experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not what the preachers preached, but you need to find your own a personal experience with Christ. &gt;&gt; That's all that matters. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are so blessed. Are you blessed? &gt;&gt; Amen. I am so blessed to be in his presence. Amen. So, let's have another song. We just have a few songs remaining around two or three to close the session. So, we have the next song, The Crimson Ribbon. And sister faith wrote this song and she got the inspiration from the message that pastor I preached last week the world that Jesus died for. And so we shall have an extract of this message to get to know her inspiration. So we shall have the audio played as we listen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The sea of glass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is the representation of the present altar where the sacrifice was laid. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And these people here were standing on the sea of glass. Thank God for the lamb that was slain. Thank God for the lamb that was slain. And they glorified God. They sang the song of Moses. They sang the song of the lamb. They were glorifying God for the atonement. What you worship him today? What you thank him that you are redeemed. Who are you to bring yourself in the sea of Galile? It is the hand of grace. God bless you. God bless you. It's the hand of grace that finally brings us at the Sea of Galass. Hallelujah. And the reflections of the greatness of Jehovah being seen through you. No power, no sir. Not by might, not by power, but by strength. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you, brother Moses. The blood sacrifice of Jesus gave me the key. When he said, "Behold, I stand and knock at the door. I opened up my heart." There was an invisible union as the word stepped in and breathed life into me. So I will hold on to the green sun ribbon as Jericho crumble. Paint the blood over the door. Let the death angel pass. I will claim the blood of Jesus and redemption for my life. The sacrifice was given. I am free. I'm chosen and elected by predestination. The seing of life within me is eternal. I'm confident in what he promised that he will do for me. And when I falter, I bring it under the blood. So I will hold on to that prince son from home. May the blood of God adore and let the death angel cast. I will claim the blood on Jesus and redemption for my life. The sacrifice was given. I am free. He didn't save me today to lose me tomorrow. And I know that my salvation is of the Lord. I'll feed upon the word to quicken my rapuring faith is taught by might by the spirit and the blood. I will hold on to the green stars relevant death angel pass. I will claim the blood of Jesus and repent for my life. Sacrifice receive and I are free. I want to honor Jerry was crumb and let the death angel pass. I will claim the blood on Jesus as redemption. All my life is sacrifice. Even I am free. &gt;&gt; I will hold on to the green river. Jericho crumble. May the blood of adore. Let the death show pass. I will claim the blood of Jesus and redemption for my life. The sacrifice was given. I am free. The sacrifice was given. I am free. I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the sacrifice was given and I am free. &gt;&gt; Amen. Chosen and elected by predestination. Not because you wanted to be but because he chose you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the next is body change from brother Joshua and he was inspired from the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 and 55 and 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1-4 and a few more other scriptures but I'll read out 1 Corinthians 15 verse 51 to 55. The song is titled body change. Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this moto must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this moto shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. Oh death, where is thy string? Oh grave, where is thy victory? We shall be changed. How I long to be clothed clothed upon with mighty of my knee. How I long to be changed. Oh yes. From this mortal to evil. How I long, how I long to be clothed, float upon, flow upon with mighty. How I long, how I long to be changed. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. From this mortal to immortality. Someday this vessel of earth will dissolve. into a glorious building that never dies. There are so many cracks and pests that infest this house. I long to change my dwelling place from here. How I long, how I long to be the poor, &gt;&gt; Lord, the &gt;&gt; with my &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, how I long, &gt;&gt; how I long to be changed. Oh yes. From this portal to immortality. Behold now so plain. This is the mystery. Be that alive. Want to sleep but be chained. Now being quickened by rapturing faith in the word will be translated to meet loved ones and cry. Behold now so plain. Behold now so plain. This is the mystery. Paul tells us a mystery without a lie. Won't all sleep but we'll be changed. We are now being weakened by rapturing faith in the word. Faith in the word that is preached will be translated and we'll meet our loved ones in Christ. Oh, how I long, how I long to be clothed. I want to be clothed, Lord. Let my Theophony speak to me every day. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I Lord, &gt;&gt; how I &gt;&gt; to be changed &gt;&gt; from this mortal. From this water &gt;&gt; from this mortal &gt;&gt; to give immortality. &gt;&gt; How I long &gt;&gt; How I long to be clothed &gt;&gt; clothe the mighty. How I long, &gt;&gt; how I long to be &gt;&gt; from this home. &gt;&gt; From this. &gt;&gt; Just sing it with me everyone. &gt;&gt; How I long. &gt;&gt; Oh, I alone. alone to be clothed. &gt;&gt; Clothe. &gt;&gt; I want my body to glow me. Oh, I know. &gt;&gt; How I know I know &gt;&gt; to be changed &gt;&gt; from this mortal. Proise mortal to immortality. &gt;&gt; Promise mot &gt;&gt; from this mortal &gt;&gt; to be immortal. &gt;&gt; I want to be changed from this mortal from this mortal &gt;&gt; from &gt;&gt; as the word is preached every day. May it give me rapturing faith. Oh J from this bottle &gt;&gt; from this portal to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a prayer. &gt;&gt; How we all long to be changed. And sure the scripture says we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is a sure thing. We shall have to be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's been such a wonderful experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have been blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I trust that we shall not go back the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. Such a dozen sermons from every song. It cannot leave us the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have our last song. I was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The song is I was there. &gt;&gt; Were you there? &gt;&gt; Amen. So this song is one of the very first songs that we are written original songs and uh I'll invite sister Faith to come and credit those that sang the song. And afterwards, hope sister hope the pastor says you have to be here. You were there. So you come and be here. Amen. Even sister Pes and and Pastor Sa. So sister faith will create the song then pastor I will come and take the inspiration of the song. Amen. Are you blessed? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I was there &gt;&gt; and I've always been there &gt;&gt; and that's why I'm here. So we thank God for these moments of fellowship &gt;&gt; having worship you know Sundays and one of these days we shall need testimony Sundays. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we can get people like brother Samson come and tell their story. you know why he ends up limping when he was born straight and those kind of things we may need to hear them. So I certainly appreciate God. No I remember one thing that up in Matthew 17 on the mount of transfiguration John Peter and James were taken up before the blood was released on Mount Calvary. And you know Jesus transfigured himself from the flesh Jesus to the supernatural Christ and then stood by his side. Elijah and Moses representing the resurrection and the the rapture. They were up there and then John were just being shown a forest of what it shall be. So they were outside of the ring before Calvary. After Calvary, we come to the center of the ring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not worshiping from the the perimeters. We are at the center. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to say we were there. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when the sons of God shouted for joy, we were there. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are not strangers here. &gt;&gt; We are here. And today we are in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; And as brother Joshua singing about the theophony, you know, in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus where we are seated, I want to tell you one thing that we are just a thought away from our theopanic. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of these days we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'll do one thing. I present the quote where the inspiration comes from. And this is the message serpent seed of 1958 September 28th. The prophet says, "I want to ask you, who is this?" Job 27 all through to 38. When he said, "Where was you when I laid the foundation of the earth? When the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy, who were those sons of God that were shouting for joy?" Jesus told them that I had joy with you before the foundation of the world. We are not creatures of time. &gt;&gt; We are creatures of eternity. &gt;&gt; No man can come to me except my father draws him. And all that comes to me, I'll give them eternal life and raise him upon the last days. No one can pluck them from my father's hand. &gt;&gt; Who gave them to me? How are you going to lose? He's asking how are you going to lose? So I was there. &gt;&gt; You was there. &gt;&gt; That's why we are together meeting in fellowship in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are there, stand up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and just rejoice as this song is being sung and you know shake your brother's hand and give a testimony. I was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was there, brother Wilson. I was there. I was there. I was there. God bless you. &gt;&gt; We are going to use Sweet meories of glory land. What a cross my ransom soul. And as before, ghost I stand as I do recall. I was there. Yes, I was there. When the sons of God together, I was there. Yes, I was there. When the stars are born, he shall be joy. I am surely an angel spirit me through this world to it. Oh to the sea. I was I was I was there. Yes, I was there. When I he my child s my Oh my go. I came from God. Hallelujah is to I was there. Yes, I was there. He shall be there. I was there. Yes, I was there. You will fall. We shall rejoice. I was Yes, I was with you. I was Yes, I was shall reordall. I don't think we should stop here. I just wait like as we have just started. I wish we having this all the time. All the time. All the time. All the time. And every time we have this kind of singing, there are new songs that keep on coming until you want to repeat them. Lay them down. There's also another one. I'm told. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So, we want to let us clap for them. We want to appreciate We want to appreciate all of you. I know this season has been harder. Last year was hard. Last year we almost failed. But this day, this time we didn't have faith that oh, we didn't have doubt that we were going to fail. But again, it was harder this year. But nonetheless, we want to thank God who has given us the grace to be here. It has been challenging. And I remember I think it was in 2021 or 22 when we started our own when we started streaming. I think either 2021 or 22 and one of the things that compelled us to start streaming was you know these kind of original songs because many times those other previous years where we would hire people to come and record they don't do good work but you're paying them but we thank God that everything we sing nowadays is always recorded and it's permanent. Praise the name of our Lord. So we are so much grateful for all the sacrifices. Pastors just reminded me that this song I was there was sung about 30 years ago. Original composition here about 30 years ago and that is now in the '9s. There's also another song but I'm just forgetting. There were quite a number of songs. The Holy Ghost right now is passing. There are other songs nonetheless but that was done about 30 years ago and we just feel like we shouldn't stop here. The way brother work Elijah was saying that he got inspiration by seeing what has been done here and we appreciate God that the gifts keep on multiplying. Praise the name of our Lord. There is a year we had I think it was over a hundred original songs written some time but we failed to sing all of them but I believe that as we go on the Lord will be giving us more grace to keep on singing. I want to recognize Mida SA so much for the song. I'm happy I saw you sing together with Vicky or Joke then little Lyel. We want to see most of those young gifts come up and grow up. Then patients was telling me that Faith, Ruth and Comfort that they started singing when they were 5 years, you know, in special singing and they are still singing more than 20 years. So we appreciate that. Praise the name of our Lord. And we just want to encourage more and more. One thing perhaps which is strange is that most of the people stayed here are sisters. Then I was wondering except the young brother behind and when I looked at also the Langa team I think there was also just a few brothers two or three then I looked at the Mayuga team I don't think there was a brother there so I'm wondering what's happening to the brothers of course I know some of them on equipment there but we need to come up praise the name of our Lord let let us see that we don't leave it to the sisters us alone. Let us be involved such that you know we can be able to rejoice together for what the Lord has done. We want to appreciate you all who have been able to come from far and near from different places to be part of this. We appreciate those who did contributions in one or another. We appreciate all the sacrifices that have been done that we've been able to have this day. We always desire to have more days but sometimes it becomes challenging because some brothers work in Campala and some sisters and different places. So coming together becomes a challenge but we thank God the grace that he keeps on giving us. We are praying for more grace that we may be able to do more and more. Then there's a brother who was challenging me. Why don't you have these songs produced you know like to put them in professional production. Now that's a hurdle which we still have but we pray that the Lord helps us that this music does not end in our sosia and maybe in our church or on our YouTube channel but to see how that it can be of help also to other places. So thank you so much for all who have come. We appreciate you. We the youth so much for your sacrifices and time and I pray that the Lord blesses you so much. I don't know if I'm also to give prayer brother. Okay, let us stand up and pray. Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you for your love, grace, and mercy. We thank you for this day that you've given us this opportunity to come, Lord, and hear all these songs that you've inspired our brothers and our sisters to write.
