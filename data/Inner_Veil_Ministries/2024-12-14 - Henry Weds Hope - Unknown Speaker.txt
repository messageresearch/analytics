name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] you can order them somewhere they will send the certificates they send their certificates let me just have a brief word to accomp there amen I request the congregation for just one or two minutes to stand up and we read from First Corinthians chapter 7 First Corinthians 7 verse 32 we shall read only a few verses it says but I would have you without carefulness watch those words but I would have you without careful is cares for the things that belong to the Lord how he may please the Lord but he that is married cares for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife there is a difference between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord that both in body and in spirit but she that is married cares for the things of the world how she may please her husband and this I speak for your own Prophet not I cast a SN upon you for that which is C that you may attend upon the Lord without destruction If any man think that he behaves himself UNC toward his virgin if she pass the flow of her edge and need so require let him do what he will he sinth not let them marry [Music] may God had blessing the reading we may get SE amen amen so we all come you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we must be able to uh thank God for Henry and H they are the guests of hon amen amen and the guests of honor I'm told they are never late they are only delayed is that amen so some circumstances have delayed them and it's already 130 so I try my best to make sure that they don't I don't eat much of their time because they have got other guests around amen amen so thank you than you Pastor James katumba for allowing me to come and preside over here amen our Elder understand is in Tania is in the missionary and I'm grateful to Stand Here amen you should congratulate me I was able to I was able to get the color of the of the bride it's not easy because they hide and do whatever I don't know how I was I have made it amen amen so brother Henry and sister hope I'm so grateful I just want to speak something that is quite uh good and I think it should be able to help of us Paul saying I would have you without carefulness so says if you are not married you care for the things that belong to the Lord how you may please God and Paul are saying I would have you so that you don't have that care you don't get away from that because the unmarried person is caring for God but the moment you get married but he that is married he cares for the things of the world how he may please his wife amen and he said there is a a wide difference between a married girl and an unmarried why the unmar is caring about God keeping her body looking for Spiritual things but the married one he cares how he may please her husband the same thing with a man when a man is not married he's caring about things of the Lord but the moment he gets married there is another care that comes upon them and Paul saying I wish you are like me because for him he never married and all his life was caring for God when a man gets married a woman gets married then the care changes and this this afternoon I want to speak about caring to police he says because when you marry you always caring to please your part so the Bible expects us to marry and when we marry we must care to please the people we have got married to is that amen just like the way man who is not married cares to please God but when a man gets married part of the for God is given unto the wife and when a woman is married part of the care which was given unto is is given unto the husband so you have taken a part that was of God and you are giving it to another person you must keep it well so that's why I'm saying caring to pleas because it says they care to please their pattern you have you get a companion of your pleasure when you get married you get a companion of your pleasure and that word pleasure it means a feeling of satisfaction or an enjoyment so the people or the person you got you get married to is a companion of your satisfaction or your enjoyment because while you were serving God there was something which was missing you are like Adam while he was God there was something missing and when God saw it he says it is not good is that amen it's like the woman while she was alone she was safe deep inside of her she was looking for a companion God brings her God brings him to please one another is that amen so marriage starts with choices that are pleasing you don't marry a person who doesn't please you the very choice you are pleased so the young man the woman girl or the boy must find somebody in whom they are pleased to dwell with is that amen the beginning of it should be pleasing amen you know somebody are pleased with so she must be pleasing to you he must be pleasing your morning we are looking at two Pleasant amen Henry saw somebody who pleased him and hope found somebody who pleased her that amen so a part that you get married to you must be pleased to please is that amen somebody you are pleased with but you are ready to please that because the saying that's your work is saying the the married person must please their wies they must please their husband is that amen and so he she must be pleased to please you there are people that you work to please and you are pleased to please them so when we marry we find people that are pleased to pleas God cares for us and the tells us in Jeremiah 2911 he has got good thoughts thoughts of Peace not thoughts of evil to bring us to unexpected end so God cares for us amen a prophet preacher said he cares do you care amen God cares but do you care if is caring then you must also care amen it's a double way if Henry is car to please hope then hope must also care to please Henry that's the way things move he cares but you care amen and when you find somebody who is caring to please you you must care to please those people is that amen if you find a wife or you find a husband who is caring to make you pleased you must also care make that husband if it is the one who train it will not work is that amen he cares do you care God he has got a good plan for us we as human beings we think we can plan better than God but not at all God has the best plan and if you give your life unto him I have got better plans got good plans for you to bring you to unexpected end and when you get into his hands you must care so that you fulfill his will amen and that's why we pray and say your will be done amen the will of God is not to do us evil it's not to do us Havoc to do us well when hope comes to Henry as a husband and wife he should be able to know that he has got good plans amen a husband should have good plans to make the wife happy and the wife also should have good plans make a husband Happ so you can be able to say your will be done because you know the will of the husband and the will of the wife is to do good is that amen the Bible tells us in in Proverbs 31 he talks about that woman she will always do her husband good and her husband is pleased her husband is respected because she wants him to be happy amen and when we are praying God we don't ask the Lord to change to we don't ask to change God's mind because we know his mind is perfect we ask God to change our mind God change my mind because your will is good if you have got something which is not right in a marriage and you know your spouse has has got good intentions you to change your mind so that you can have the same mind amen and when you have the same mind you will achieve when you are united you can achieve greatly and that comes when your minds come together there was a young man he was a Catholic he was given a book to pray and he was praying for his mother the mother to get well and later on the mother died the boy got the book went and B the book said I don't need it because I was praying for the mother to live and she has died why sometimes we react like that is that amen we throw away the books this because it hasn't given us what we wanted but did you know the will of God he has better plans amen if things are not working in your way it doesn't mean that God doesn't love you that he doesn't exist when we marry there are times things don't work exactly don't throw away amen amen ask the Lord will you change my mind your word because you have better plans if somebody has got good intentions good attitude good motive and you is mistaking it you should really pray that God changes your mind do you love the Lord because the Bible tells us everything works together for good to them that love God so if you in the love of God whatever is going to happen it will be for your good because he has got good plans amen so when we get married we need to please others it's a very hard thing to please a person we are going to look at it it's not easy to please a person but when you get the Bible says You must care to please that person is that amen uh there was a question asked that if you are going to get married you are just the beginning you get a dream and then the dream is showing you a certain sister you see her we having good time we are going to have a bright future and then when you look at that dream you say I wish this dream comes to pass because I was so happy amen then you wake up you go and meet that sister and said sister do you know what I have a dream and the dream was we were living together and we were so happy then the sister looks says brother I would have nothing about against that but one thing when I look at it me I think I would not be happy with you there's a brother whom I feel I would be much happier with how do you feel what would be your reaction somebody is telling you be happier with another person but for you you have had a dream that you would be happy together if you a real Christian are together you would say God bless you Sister I want you to be happy if you would be happier there I think I would be happy why you care for the happiness of that person but if you don't care for the happiness of that person you save these people that's why you never Prosper that's why you unfortunate you are missing a lot you know you be get all sorts of words who never help you who whoever bring you out together but we must be careful other people are happy as we are happy is that amen if she's not going to be happy it's very difficult to keep an unhappy person somebody who is not happy with you your looks irritate your looks irritate them your words they they so bad even when they hear you are coming back they feel you I wish you never came back am but when somebody loves you and is happen with you when you delay a little bit they saying we are waiting for you we are waiting for you but if they don't like you you can St it's very hard to stay with somebody who is not happy so we must Endeavor to have our partners happy is that amen we must make sure that they are really they are enjoying do you love the Lord so one who happiness should be one who Joy if your wife is not happy you can never be happy but if she's happy you will be happy I believe God is happy when we are happy is that amen so the same thing should be husband is not happy you wondering how can I make this man happy so great care is that amen so the happiness of others should matter even much more than our happiness I want my wife to be happy my wife would want me to be happy amen so we are always working our ways to make sure that we make each other happy you pray for one another amen it's like the way you are saying let God be pleased with me amen you know you there are things that would be good for you if God is not happy with that you feel like you have lost it I want something that would make God happy amen may God make the marriage of Henry and and hope a happy marriage a blessed marriage amen because happiness it cannot be both amen amen uh those of you are believers of the message you remember brother Bram when he was getting married he was very poor and he was fearing even to go and and propos that wife the sister propos the sister the sister said you going talk to our parents and the par were way richer way richer and he was fearing so when he went to the dad the says how are you how are you sir I think everything is okay but the dad had already known what was behind why he had come he just said say Bill you can have hope don't mind what your income is keep her happy as long as you two people are happy I would rather you have her Tre her mean and they were married and were happy and he told him happiness does not consist of how much of the worldly Goods you have how much you are contented with thetion that has given am be contented with hope be contented that's your portion in this entire world you are not going to get another wife you don't get another husband the portion which God prepared for you be contented make it happy make it joyous make it prosperous if you beat you are beating your own if you if you despise you are despising your own amen amen we must be able to look at the at we must look at the happiness of others amen now other people can have certain certain proposals that that they think would make you pleased before you get married people have got they have got certain proposals this woman would make you happy this woman would please you because they have been pleased that amen so what other people being pleased with may not be exactly what is supposed to please because we are met we are made different your parents may even say this girl is good this boy is good deep inside of you if they are not pleased you should never take that choice I'm not saying people should not propose they can advise you they can tell you that a real person of a real person of your heart there is a way your heart gets settled there are certain uniqueness that you can't explain others she may not be the most beautiful he may not be the most handsome there something about that girl you when you get that person you have started going home you have started having a house amen you know how do you know that before you get married there's a question can you live without that girl without that can you live without that boy if you can't then you have sett home amen you you love them asking why but you love that person they said please please can you look for another and you can't get you have started get home is that amen those who already maybe you you didn't have that those who are coming take a not there was a king called one time he had a wife the wife was called and the man one time had a fe so when he was happy he was excited he said can you bring my wife but the wife was busy pleasing others she was with women Affairs and she never came the man was so much displeased the man was embarrassed he sent the first messenger she never sent the second one but remember when you marry the first person you must please is your husband and your wife so when she refused the people they said this is a bad sign should be put away and then the king should look and get a woman that will please him Amen in the book ofter 2 said then then said the king Ser 2 verse 2 mined unto him for the king and let the king appoint officers in all provinces of his kingdom together all the fairin theace to the house of the women the C of the king's chamain keep off the women and let their things for purification be given them and let the maiden which pleases the king be Queen instead of [Music] v and the thing pleased the king and he did so let the what happened they GED so many women young virgins beautiful and they gave them a number of months to pufy themselves and when they came out you know sometimes when you go to to a shop to buy clothes you may get you may come back with nothing if you're not careful because when you reach there you are blown by the so many things this one this one this one everything looks good what do you do you need prayer pick a CL and go away if you stay there you will borrow you do whatever are we so the King was given so many women so many girls to choose and one of them was Esther but when Esther came out she was not of his tribe she was not of that Nation but there was something about when she came out says the King was pleased The King The King loved Esther the king favored Esther had Grace upon es amen and he chose among all the girls people can suggest to you but you must choose a choice that will please your heart and there's only one choice when you make it stay with it look after it is that amen there's a common saying in once you have your it tend it put everything and then every day it will look better it will give you children it will give you Joy it will give you banana leaves it will give you everything look to please your the king brought out Esther amen and when she was taken out certain ladies once they in between with other girls when the girls are with others you may not choose but you just speak out is that amen once you have prayed and God has led you out when you bring it aside and you begin to give a special care people will wonder they say I used to pass her I didn't know she could make something like that that amen why you are caring to care you are caring to is that amen I'm telling you there is a lot of Beauty in hope that people have never seen it's going to come out when hry begins to show amen people don't know what what's in in Henry but let Hope begin working on him she's a designer she's to design that boy that amen feed him every morning amen tell him to change know men sometime they don't even want to change clthes your cles pleas they don't want the way you look when they begin to care for this young man some people say I didn't know that amen each of us is very beautiful and handsome in their own way let somebody take care of is that amen now there are some photos when I when when I just got married when I look at them I a stick like this very funny but Juliet has worked upon me and now amen I think she's she's in our medicine maybe she if she's is my wife around okay they will bring she's outside she's looking after our SE amen but she's also now very wonderful I'm also wonderful we are caring to please one another you can make it brother Henry you can make it sister hope hope you can make the rest of you you can look after your wife you can look after your husband and make a difference she's your spirit your she's your spirit is that amen that's what the Bible says she's your spirit part of you she has taken out of you is that amen and when you love love has tension because when you love somebody you always wondering is this going to please that person because you want them to be pleased so pleasing goes with tension when you get tension in marriage it's sometimes just a love aspect in marri times you get tension is not happy and you thought this would make them happy so you must go back to the drawing board together don't just defend yourself some of you you are the people the pastor was preaching about you can never be pleased go back check and what what what try to find out what pleases your pattern amen so tension can even bring you together sometimes there are things that are not working out well and you come back and your part is not happy you say what has happened maybe the way you spoke while you were living at home the way you shouted you we left somebody unhappy that tension there where has the happiness gone you must find out don't just say some of those people ignore them ignore them they will get annoyed and they will keep come when you ignore those things yet there are things that you can work about you continue to create the gapay about it think about it tension in a home there's a lot I have to say but trying to jump as much as I [Music] can amen when you become a Christian you you get tension am I pleasing God am my words okay is what I have done okay the same thing when you get married you get tension you have been a Freel person but I want tell you you are getting onion brother tension has already started now hope tension has started how are you to please this man somebody's son Somebody's Daughter together you look at her how would she be happy in finishing take these few things that I'm finishing with life transion life transitional changes should be carefully observed and handled with today I've just declared them husband and wife they have never been that he a trans and it take them a gradi to be comptible so that transition should be really handled with care the rest of us who are watching and even yourself it's like a blood transfusion they want you to live when they give you blood blood gets compati to your body it will be a fight but the blood is supposed to help you so there is something which I'm calling Nostalgia Nostalgia is a French word which mean is homesickness is that amen when people are gotten married they get Nostalgia home sickness there is a saying East or West home is cre a home which will be satisfying as the home where the man and and the woman have come from is a problem is a feeling of some memories in the past there are times it's a sickness serious sickness I'm saying you know when you away from home there are times when a feeling comes upon you and you remember home and you remember running around with a and you remember going to sleep at your easy and remember you used to eat and you see some people crying so what's the problem are you okay says I'm okay but what has happened Nostalgia children when they go school when they have just gone there they suffer from Nostalgia and now when this happens it always can happen at the beginning of the marriage it can happen in the middle of the marriage it can even happen at the end of the marriage now there was a man called David you see David one time suffered from Nostalgia we not read there but one time they were in a battle fighting and he just reach at time and says I wish I would drink of the water of Bethlehem I wish somebody can give me the water of Beth he was okay things are not that bad but he suffered from Nostalgia some men some of these officials they went through the to fight and get him just a bucket and when the bucket came he looked at it said will this really satisfy me I'm not even want to drink it he poured it on the ground what was it the water of Home sometimes when you marry there's no fridge sometimes when you marry there's no pot you know these days for me realized they water and most of us who gra in areas where we used to smoke water in when we get water we feel like we are back home again are we together and that homesickness it always disturbs marri you find somebody as if they feel like going home you know for us at home for for me my mother for me my father for me my brothers whatever and you are suffering and then somebody you can go back you can go back to your mother but what they do that's is that amen and each of us we have it whether you grow old you can suffer from there was a man called nemiah one time he was serving the king engulfed him he started to cry tears he started to cry and he said W people living how are the people at home living He said they are suffering that day when he came before the king the man was miserable saying what's the problem with you why Happ today he said how can I be happy my people are suffering think about one another when they begin suff from Nostalgia there's one time brother's dad started to cry started to cry a big man in his 50s and he's crying and then the son said Dad what's the problem say I want to go home I want to go said you want to go says what's the problem what don't you have here says my son you don't understand it but when you get older you will know it when people get older sometimes before they even die saying take me home take me home what the problem they want to look at that land there's something calling back there something about home always home is the best you must be able to know how to sometimes you have to say let us go together when she when she's crying she want to see her parents don't every time [Applause] parent just tell her when would you want us to Vis Vis maybe he wants to visit I stop on that there are changes that happen in life and you must be able to understand your pattern don't sometime there are menual changes amen the sisters you find them behaving well something has happened I was a teacher one time but when he would be at school I would see how teachers would K those big girls and I now come to understand when I grow that they lacked understanding because some of these girls when they are big they go through menstrual cycles and when they are suffing like that I mean change they can't do things like the way they say sometimes even husbands do that you dodging you doging I will end there sometimes a change in life sometimes when women get pregnant they become wild they become sickly they become dodgy and if you are not careful you say This Woman This Woman what's wrong with the woman it's wrong with your understanding I will go the last one it's called menopause when a woman man gr you stop going through cycles of and that change of cycle is very difficult some of them feel like the world is Turing upside down the women they can become sickly some of them they run away from their homes 30 years in marriage you see a woman becoming wild she has become a devil she doesn't listen she like this but she's going through a change of life one time a woman came to a servant of the Lord and she was crying she said I'm not going to eat anything until I find out the solution and the man said what is it says I went to a preacher a preacher told me I have got seven demons and they have been praying and the devils are not going I went to another woman preacher she told me I have got five I'm wondering where did the two demons go I must know and the preacher looked at I said I don't know where went God began now to to reveal the problem and the preacher told her I can see your problem recently you received shots about and the problem is you are going through menopause when you are going to stop being like other women and when that happens the whole world looks like it's different things change are we following church now the woman was saying I think that is it you don't have any demon you don't have any Spirit what you are having is a change of life and then the woman started feeling happier she started even eating can you pray for me the devil he said which devil no the devil which is disturbing is just a change of life go back home cook for your husband Embrace him sit around with him Everything Will Change the man was giving her div to pleas your may the good Lord bless you the Lord guide you
