[34:04] I'm just
[34:06] [Music]
[34:20] amen Amina

[34:28] that
[34:32] is saved by grace
[34:36] next time we sing it that way
[34:39] I'm no longer sinner
[34:42] I was a sinner
[34:45] that is saved by grace
[34:48] amen Amina let's stand up and get into
[34:51] the teaching of the world this morning
[34:55] foreign
[35:04] let's buy heads in the word of prayer
[35:07] Freedom when he came today from Chicago
[35:10] the great and gracious God
[35:15] the one who has loved us eternally
[35:20] we come before your presence
[35:24] with Thanksgiving
[35:27] that once again you've given us the
[35:30] grace
[35:32] to come under fellowship with you
[35:36] father we humble ourselves
[35:41] as we pray that you may teach our hearts
[35:47] how to walk the work of a new birth
[35:53] give us father dear God Revelation
[35:57] that we may walk thereby today
[36:00] I commit you the needs of the people
[36:05] further that you may deal with them this
[36:08] morning
[36:09] foreign
[36:14] [Music]
[36:39] born again
[36:41] not of corruptible seed
[36:44] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[36:49] which liveth and abideth forever
[37:07] may the Lord that blessing the reading
[37:09] of his word
[37:11] you may be seated
[37:16] so this morning
[37:18] Angelo we are going to speak on the new
[37:21] birth and its life
[37:26] you see where there is a bus
[37:30] there must be a life to live
[37:34] when you give a bath that does not have
[37:38] a life
[37:40] then we call it a steel bath
[37:45] so you know the new balance
[37:50] and it's life
[37:53] amen Amina so I want to clarify somebody
[37:57] watch the new birth is before we dig
[38:01] into it
[38:10] brother Branham says
[38:13] too many of our modernists
[38:16] [Music]
[38:23] believe in Salvation at a certain
[38:27] specific time
[38:30] which in the many cases is called making
[38:34] a decision
[38:39] and that has been called receiving
[38:41] Christ or being born again
[38:46] now to receive Christ
[38:54] to receive his spirit
[38:56] is to be born again
[38:59] to receive his spirit
[39:02] is to be baptized with the Holy ghosts
[39:45] [Music]
[39:57] [Music]
[40:03] [Music]
[40:14] by the word of God foreign
[40:58] [Music]
[40:59] into their depths in this service
[41:03] so we shall go to John chapter three
[41:09] and this Jesus
[41:13] now the scripture says in John 3 verse
[41:20] that's where we are going this morning
[41:24] amen amen John 3 1
[41:27] the Holy Spirit says there was a man of
[41:31] the Pharisees
[41:33] no he is so specific here
[41:37] he's saying there was a man of the
[41:40] foreign
[41:42] [Music]
[42:07] it was
[42:09] of the forest s
[42:12] and he was a ruler
[42:14] and to be a rulers
[42:17] [Music]
[42:20] to understand
[42:21] [Music]
[42:23] so we are dealing with a man
[42:26] who is literally indicated in scriptures
[42:29] [Music]
[42:31] so the Bible says the same came to Jesus
[42:40] we know that thou art a teacher come
[42:44] from God
[42:48] from the end of the language
[42:54] so he says
[42:57] [Music]
[43:01] except God be with him
[43:05] now have you seen the angle would you
[43:08] always
[43:16] approaching him as an educator
[43:21] [Music]
[43:25] so in that day
[43:29] [Music]
[43:31] could not come by recognizing Christ as
[43:35] God sent pictures
[43:46] come by recognizing that God has sent us
[43:51] a prophet
[43:53] foreign
[44:28] [Music]
[44:33] [Music]
[44:48] [Music]
[44:53] Thunder
[44:56] [Music]
[45:11] amen Amina so brother Branham says one
[45:16] day when Jesus was upon
[45:19] using a certain man came to visit him
[45:24] this man says
[45:27] we know you are a teacher he sent from
[45:30] God
[45:32] but you will notice
[45:35] Jesus
[45:40] and the word is
[45:44] [Music]
[45:50] um
[45:57] I am making it possible for the New
[46:00] Birth by my spirit
[46:03] but the race
[46:04] [Music]
[46:06] who is the teacher he's the Holy Spirit
[46:11] when Jesus was upon the Earth yes
[46:16] and that's the prophet
[46:19] but when he came back upon the church
[46:23] by his Spirit he became a teacher yeah
[46:27] so there are two phases of Jesus Christ
[46:32] that we have to deal with
[46:35] to get into the new birth
[46:39] you must recognize him together as the
[46:43] Lamb of God
[46:48] are you together
[46:53] Lord forgive me Lord take away my sins
[47:07] the same phrase of Christ again
[47:12] foreign
[47:20] [Music]
[47:28] [Music]
[47:57] [Music]
[48:09] foreign
[48:11] [Music]
[48:32] [Music]
[48:44] the understanding wider yeah
[48:47] [Music]
[49:00] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[49:05] unless except a man is born again
[49:09] he cannot see Chinese
[49:12] [Music]
[49:17] so two great statements
[49:22] [Music]
[49:24] amen are you together
[49:26] you're there for must see
[49:34] are you together with me one is it
[49:36] because in the First National Bank
[49:40] when she was in the garden of Heaven
[49:44] Abdel and Cain ability were born out of
[49:48] Heaven
[49:51] could have been considered the
[49:54] development of the Kingdom of Heaven
[50:00] amen amen but when they sinned in them
[50:04] they were put out of that spot but uh
[50:08] away from the tree of life
[50:11] therefore away from the kingdom
[50:18] is to see the kingdom again
[50:21] and enter into it
[50:24] and in a broader perspective
[50:28] the kingdom of God is the very life of
[50:33] the Holy Ghost
[50:34] foreign
[50:44] [Music]
[50:56] [Music]
[51:04] foreign
[51:12] [Music]
[51:24] [Music]
[51:34] [Music]
[51:46] amen amen so continuing with John
[51:49] chapter three
[51:51] verse 5 says
[51:53] Jesus answered yes very very
[51:57] yeah
[52:02] and of the spirit he cannot enter into
[52:07] the kingdom of God
[52:10] Amen Amina so born of water
[52:16] and the spirit no more yeah so this
[52:19] water is not the water bathroom you took
[52:23] in this pool
[52:26] that inducts you to The Fellowship of
[52:29] believer
[52:32] because this baptism is
[52:40] are you together with me Brian is it it
[52:42] does not save me
[52:43] so water don't save a man
[52:49] he touched the blood of Jesus Christ
[52:53] there's no life in water
[52:57] comes in the blood cell I mean life
[53:01] comes in the blood cells
[53:05] sanctification
[53:10] to kill the desire of sin
[53:13] the Holy Spirit comes into that clean
[53:17] version
[53:20] [Music]
[53:25] foreign
[53:37] [Music]
[53:50] [Music]
[53:55] are you together with me when is it
[53:57] unless you are born of what
[53:59] and of Spirits
[54:09] [Music]
[54:11] by way of the world
[54:16] let me take you to Ephesians 5 26 that's
[54:20] why Memphis is
[54:22] Ephesians 5 26 therefore
[54:27] might sanctify
[54:31] and he cleanse the church
[54:34] with the washing of water
[54:40] so this water here because
[54:47] foreign
[55:12] [Music]
[55:23] [Music]
[55:30] amen Amina and when you feel the annuity
[55:33] conditions
[55:34] [Music]
[55:38] when the father you started the world
[55:41] when you are trying to conform to the
[55:45] standard of the Holy Spirit
[55:50] when you say that you cannot conform to
[55:53] the world
[55:54] [Music]
[55:55] when you started reading
[55:58] and then you said Lord forgive us
[56:02] when you are being washed by them
[56:05] to make yourself ready to received
[56:12] to complete the New Balance
[56:15] the washing of Water by the word
[56:20] and then the spirit that the word
[56:23] produces
[56:28] the process of the New Balance
[56:35] when something is born
[56:38] without life that is
[56:59] that must project
[57:07] [Music]
[57:18] [Music]
[57:41] [Music]
[57:56] but it's a personal way God is dealing
[58:01] with you as an individual
[58:03] foreign
[58:05] [Music]
[58:23] [Music]
[58:33] [Music]
[58:50] [Music]
[59:01] [Music]
[59:25] [Music]
[59:28] no no no no
[59:38] [Music]
[59:46] [Music]
[59:56] [Music]
[1:00:07] [Music]
[1:00:09] is now calling himself
[1:00:14] a teaching Prophet
[1:00:17] um
[1:00:19] are you together with me when is it but
[1:00:22] how do people call me
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:26] he is saying himself
[1:00:30] by the office
[1:00:32] that he was using at the time
[1:00:36] he was a teaching Prophet yeah
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:54] Jesus was a prophet yes
[1:00:58] because by way of verse 14.
[1:01:06] some families yes
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:23] [Music]
[1:01:31] foreign
[1:01:56] foreign
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:02:10] foreign
[1:03:04] amen amen he says you know they said
[1:03:08] yeah everybody accepts that you are a
[1:03:11] prophet except that they don't
[1:03:14] understand
[1:03:15] which prophet
[1:03:17] and then he says but I mean he says
[1:03:28] sending now to a personal revelation
[1:03:36] have you touched
[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:03:53] it's not a general position of our local
[1:03:56] church teaching foreign
[1:04:10] [Music]
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:22] that's when it comes back
