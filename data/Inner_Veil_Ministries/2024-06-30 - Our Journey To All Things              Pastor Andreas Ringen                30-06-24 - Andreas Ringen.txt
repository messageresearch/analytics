uh just invite our brother to come over right away and speak to us of What the Lord Has put on his heart you're welcome my brother God bless you God bless you amen amen God bless you you all this morning we want to greet you all again The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ amen it's again a great privilege for me to be back here again amen and uh just being a witness of what God is doing we believe God is doing God is doing great things amen amen we believe that he is still alive amen we serve a living God Amen Christianity can point back to an empty grave amen there's an empty grave in Jerusalem that proves that Jesus Christ is alive but you don't need to go to Israel to find out that he is life I can assure you the grave in Jerusalem is empty why is it empty because he is here today he is alive today amen and is such again I want to say God bless you and I just want to say again to brother Steven uh um May the Lord richly bless him and I just deem this a great privilege to to be here and speak to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we know one another for quite some years we know one another for some years already amen and uh and it's good to to get to know one another not after the flesh amen I'm not really a German oh amen amen I'm not really a German this outside flesh is German yes but I come from eternity eternity is my home I trust I trust your home is also eternity and we are on our way back home home where we come from we come from God because he is the only one that is eternal and we going back to God Amen it is so wonderful to meet one another again seeing through all those years seeing through all those years how how the bride is maturing amen maturing in the word amen remember I remember not remember but I can think of my first time being here in Uganda uh I don't count the years so I don't know how many years ago it was but I think it was some full moons ago some full moons ago full moons ago some years ago amen amen it was some years ago amen so we not only become older but I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ has become more mature and we can speak today of things that we couldn't speak 10 years ago amen I believe we're living in a wonderful time are you not happy to be a Christian today to live today I know there's many things happening which is uh which is difficult to understand we have same in Europe and Germany our in our church we still suffer death sometimes death comes not only in of old age but also with with young people and many times we don't understand but God has a plan and I want to encourage each and everyone just stay in God's plan and then he will work it out because finally the Bible said all things work together for the good amen all things not all things are good but all things work together for the good to them that love God do you love God and to them that has a purpose that is ordained and that's not that's not your plan that's God's plan that's God's grace to you amen so that's why we trust all things work together for good and many things we might not know why we're here on Earth God don't need to tell us everything he he will tell us what we need but there's many things that we will see when we are on the other side God don't need to tell you everything here God is trusting you anyhow God is trusting you amen and if God is trusting you he don't need to tell you everything because he knows you will make it because you are a part of him amen so God bless you all this morning and uh I I'm just feel like I want to say thank you very much for having me here again can just share a little bit what the Lord put on our hearts amen amen the Lord is good isn't he and his mercy endureth forever hallelujah amen are you happy in the Lord this morning amen amen let us stand together as we go into the scripture and uh I just want to speak this morning something in my heart and uh I want to speak of the our journey towards all [Music] things we know the Bible said all things are possible do you believe that all things are possible can we say that together all things say it to yourself all things are possible to them that believe amen and we want to see this morning our journey to all things because there's a journey towards all things amen there is a journey to go to come to All Things amen you're with me we believe all things are possible but there's a journey to go that we reach that goal of all things amen let's turn to Genesis uh and we want to have Abraham in this uh this morning maybe also this afternoon we will see how the Lord leads uh Abraham uh you know actually because you know why Abraham you know Abraham has a has a special meaning to the believer he's a special Tye of the Bible because with him God started a different work amen with him God started a different work that's why the generation of Jesus Christ in Matthew 1 does not start with Adam but it starts with Abraham you read Matthew 1 the generation of Jesus Christ starts with Abraham amen amen amen that's why Abraham has such a great impact on us and Abraham's life is such an example for our life can we say Amen to that Genesis 15 we want to read from verse one after these things the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is elasa of Damascus and Abraham said behold me thou uh to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir amen and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine air and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell the Stars if th be able bble to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be hallelujah hallelujah amen just keep in mind verse 15 chapter 15 start with after these things let's turn to Genesis 22 Genesis [Music] 2 and again Watch how it [Music] starts chapter 22 Genesis 22 ver chapter 22 verse one and it came to pass that after these things things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham he said behold here I am I amen amen again it starts with after these things then verse 15 to 18 and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of e father father your word now we ask Sol light again to us [Applause] Lord it is written many hundred years ago Lord just would you make it alive for us this that we can see what Moses saw that we can see what they have seen as writing down Lord take us into thy presence I pray Make That Word Alive in our so when we go from here we can surely say is alive Jesus Christ is the [Music] same Jesus Christ [Applause] name priv you to be here Andress everyone understand me well amen everyone understands well okay so because I think it will be very important that we understand because what we will speak of this morning it is our journey we can see here Abraham on his journey but Abraham on his journey that was some thousand years ago amen but now we are on our journey we are on our journey the Bride of Jesus Christ on [Music] Journey his journey a journey to go sah journey to go so we have a journey to go we are on our journey amen our journey started did your journey start your journey didn't start in Uganda my journey didn't start in Germany because if our journey starts there then our journey will end our journey started different our journey the Journey of the Bride of Jesus started in in the mind of God there are True Believer there his journey starts when we go back don't go back into the mind of our journey ends together all the attributes that was in the mind together now manifest there's a journey believe ABR had Journey you see how the journey ended we in genesis2 that great chapter of Abraham you know Abraham was finally tested it also started with after these in Genesis 15 we told us that after these things came to in I tell you today it is important that comes to to us takes us into the vision the vision to Abraham came in the time of great great trials and dis you see as in Genesis 15 spoke to immediately Abraham was answering back understand after these things the Lord came to Abraham Vision you know when God gives Vision amen God gives Vision urg know necessary God was not just only talking [Applause] in Vision he in vision and and the vision is the Second Step from the Eternal from the from eternity from the supernatural God steps into a vision when finally the vision man materialized is God's way com [Applause] downal the supernatural God comes down in form of a vision when God Appears see how as Wasing as his journey stop was God just talking to God calling come out of out of out of your father's house you the place that I show the Bible did not say it was a vision so you see God speaks to us in different ways so he he Abraham in Genesis 15 he need to come to him in Vision 4 vision is the Second Step from Supernatural Vis Vis need to come down AB because Abram was in a very very uh urgent a very difficult condition as God said to him Fe not I am shield and exceeding great reward immediately Abram told him his problem his fights his daily life said to him oh Lord God what will th give me seeing I'm childless and seeing I'm your childish and the steward of my house of Damascus and Abraham said behold to me thou has given no seed and know the one that is born in my house shall be my you understand that so here Abraham was this daily life in his struggle coming through the promise coming through all things was in his life the struggle of the struggle came toall [Applause] in a prophetic Way Comes to that's why God sends to us prophetic [Music] word hallelujah our condition the situation that you would been in before you were Bor knew you Jeremiah he knew all God all he [Music] obain you [Applause] exactly you exactly you face [Music] today heet a message [Music] US US Vision form God came to us prophetic word form because if you hear a prophet speaking he speaks because of the [Music] vision amen believe that speaks of vision that's why he could speak to the Bride of Jesus Christ even when it was 60 years ago spoke in of vision who can believe that the words he made a human being like you and me special can take him into a r where he can see a vision see see and then he speaks he speaks according to what he sees that Vision Hallelujah that's why we needed a prophetic message message is prophetic Hallelujah hallelujah amen now we [Applause] understanding scure [Music] his amen so he could read in his he could call in his amen was theiling the word then Jesus he said is what was he doing he was able to see the picture [Applause] ofion spoken only Rec hallelujah amen but he could not be a part of the [Music] vision was not tempted by somebody quoting scripture hallelujah hallelujah do you know how brother random he just spoke to the to the church and brother Bram said we are tested like Abraham is tested you know what the final test of the Bride is the prophet said the final test to show who you are will be the word test the true church will be tested by the words amen and only if you are the words you will stand the test because Jesus was the words that that's why he stood the words test and you you catch that Satan only can quote scripture but Satan is not a part of the vision that's why he can just go what it's written but Jesus could go beyond what was written he could go and find out why it was written hallelujah hallelujah you understand if you really want to say what I say if you really want to say what I say and you understand maybe somebody is asking you what did the brother from Germany preach and then you're trying to remember he said this and he said that and he said this amen amen are you then saying what I say you only say what I say when you see what I saw that's Vision that's vision H you can follow me amen you understand how Abraham was brought to a test and it was God tempting him the Bible tells us the Lord tempted Abraham why was he temp tempting him just to prove him who he was God God likes to show who you are God wants to show to your neighbors God wants to show to your former church God wants to show to your to your village God wants to prove to the Saints who you really [Music] are and God is proving you by testing [Music] you hallelujah hallelujah that's why I think it was one of the disciples I think it was Peter saying don't see it strange don't feel strange if you fall into fiery trials is it right Peter saying don't feel strange if you attest and tries because those tests were finally more worth than gold I trust I can take us this morning on Abraham's Journey are we Abraham's Royal seat who Abraham's Royal seat this morning I don't mean your skin I mean seeds not your skin not your flesh but but are you the Royal Seed of Abraham then you are on the same Journey that Abraham went amen we can see ourselves we can see our lives in the scripture when we read about Abraham when we read about Sarah we know exactly where we are standing with God I wonder if we know where we are standing with God this morning brother Ram said the Bride of Jesus Christ is tested like Abraham was tested hallelujah hallelujah why could God test Abraham why would he test Abraham every son every son because he is a son must be tested because he's a son he can be tested hallelujah hallelujah you know and no son will not be tested why is not God not testing everyone because they are not Sons and Daughters why is God testing you that chose you that you are son and a daughter of God hallelujah hallelujah and we know how it is in school it starts with little tests in the beginning but then finally when you are upgraded upgraded upgraded upgraded you go from one class to the other class so the tests will always be more but the test is only to show who you are can we say Amen to that amen a test that comes is only to prove who you are and what you know what you have received a test in school is only to show what the teacher has told you can we say amen and here we are in the final test of Abraham Abraham on his journey to All Things amen amen Abraham on his journey to all things hallelujah hallelujah do you believe he was on his journey to all things he was on his journey to his body change through him and Sarah the son came forth is it right yes hallelujah hallelujah that was Abraham in his journey when Abraham ended his journey he had manifested through him God could show that God is Jehovah [Music] Gyra hallelujah hallelujah amen amen hallelujah hallelujah and through the life of the brides God will show that he is all and in all he's not only Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah sh all of it he is and he will prove it to the life of the Brides without Abraham God could could not manifest himself themselves but because Abraham was there God could be Jehovah he that provides the sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let us allow him to be this morning that he can be all and in all that he can manifest himself in our lives that he can prove that he is still the same yesterday today and forever the same today does not mean that he's repeating himself the same today means that he is still unveiling himself do you believe that the same yesterday when he was yesterday look back he was unveiling himself the same today he's still unveiling himself and the same forever he will continuously un regling himself and the prophet says it will take God eternity to unveil himself hallelujah hallelujah what a mighty God we serve it be a continuously unveiling it is a source that is never run dry we cannot imagine that with our Timely brains but when we one step to the other side into a tonic body then we have a better sight we have a better ear we have a better understanding we will know as we are known hallelujah hallelujah Abraham and the Royal seats the Royal seat of Abraham the generation of Jesus Christ the final generation the last generation of Jesus Christ Hallelujah this is Who We Are the World proves it the world proves it that the last generation is on earth now that generation that was see Jesus Christ coming back to Earth again and brother random says this day this scripture is fulfilled before so you are the generation you are the final generation not only the young people but also the old people you are that generation that generation is not defined by an age hallelujah hallelujah that generation is not just the young people that generation is the Bride of Jesus hey glory to God that generation you cannot Define by an age on the other side we are all young amen amen so if you ask me of my age is that my age is about 20 this age this age is about 55 amen come on church I use the final generation oh if I had time we could go into what is happening in the world today Amen in I don't know about Uganda but in Germany you see it in Kenya you see in Kenya the young people rising is that right yes we have it in Europe everywhere there's a generation Rising they call them the last they call themselves the last generation we have them everywhere we have them in the Pacific in the Pacific the water level is [Music] rising so many islands they drown and there's people living there and if you don't know Jesus Christ you have to cry for [Applause] help and there's a last generation on the face of the Earth even in Africa they have recogn our future is in danger that's why in Kenya they go on the street because they fear their future is that right amen come on Church you have that altar here you have that altar in Uganda you see things are happening nature is changing the weather is not what it was before amen we can say Amen to that there things are changing and there's a generation that understands we cannot go on like our fathers went hallelujah hallelujah spiritually speaking it is also true the gospel of yesterday what brother random says the message of Luther what was good for his day but doesn't help you in this day yet you need justification the message of wrestling is not it's not working this day yet you need sanctification the message of the Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not enough this day yet you need it can we understand that hallelujah hallelujah it's always coming more it's always getting more and there's a generation on the faith of the Earth in Germany they call themselves the last generation you have heard of it maybe maybe you have heard of them they sticks to the street they glue thems to the streets to protest to say you have to change things because we are the generation that cannot live in this world anymore there's a generation called the last generation and as brother Ram would say what is happening in the negative God is doing in the positive was it not the enemy in the time of Gideon confessing proclaiming his position when Gideon was afraid himself the Lord told him go into the camp of the enemy when he went into the camp of the enemy there was someone that had a dream in the camp of the enemy the enemy confessed the enemy had to witness who Gideon was and when Gideon heard the enemy speaking of his position he gets strengthened and if you cannot believe who you are then believe the enemy telling you who you are [Music] hallelujah hallelujah I can imagine I I know I can remember it was the year 2017 I think I preached about it here there was a was a great celebration going on in the churches the Catholic Church made a great celebration 2017 a great a great Crusade a great campaign amen and they did it and at that great campaign one of the one of the one of the young young Bishops but a very influ very influential one they called it Harvest Time they called it Harvest Time amen amen they called it it's harvest time you know what that man said 2017 he was in direct connection with the Pope you know what he said we are united protest is over he was saying protest is over there's not not such a thing as a Protestant church anymore amen the Protestant church is a church that came forth with Martin Luther who protested against the Catholic church that man says protest is over that man said we are all one he said that amen am short after it he died in an accident he said we are united now listen what brother bham said between The Binding of the wrong churches of the wheat between The Binding of the wheat and the man whe we we could I don't know if I quickly have the church AG booked for it let me quickly see if I have the church asbook then you can see what brother Bon said other I would just quote it brother Bram said between The Binding of the tears and the full manifestation of the Antichrist he said the Rapture will take place so now the enemy is telling us how far we are can we say praise the Lord if you cannot believe it as the minister is preaching it because it sounds too um yeah too fanatic Gideon couldn't believe it even the Lord told him different even the even the Lord told him the Lord told him the the Lord Gideon could not believe it even God told him what did God told him thou Mighty Man of but he couldn't believe that he asked for signs he asked for wonders but he couldn't believe it even the Lord told him who he was but he couldn't believe it how many times the minister in this Pulpit is trying to tell you who you [Music] are Watch The Life of Gideon amen finally God used the enemy to convince him because when Gideon you you understand Church how we awake we see the Bible stories speaking of our condition time that we are living in after Joshua after the Holy Spirit has left the church that was a time when Gideon was hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all types speak of our being here on Earth all scriptures become end time scriptures can you see yourself in the word can you see yourself in the examples come on church and he was gon the Lord has told him he has seen Miracles was it dry and wet the skin dry dry andet dry and wet this Gideon asked for a miracle gide you all know the story go to the Book of Judges and reads the story of Gideon Gideon was asking for a miracle okay God if that is if that is true what you said who I am then let the skin when I put it on wet ground let the skin be dry next morning Gideon woke up went out and the the grass was wet and the skin was dry and then he said okay Lord show me one more Miracle then I will believe what you said about me next morning he said Lord let the grass be Dr dry and the skin be wet and it happened like this miracle after Miracle after miracle and yet Gideon could not believe what God said about [Applause] [Music] him let us stay there for a moment because I just feel that is a point where we are many times at God told him thou are Mighty Man of valure this is who you are and then said If God be with us if God is with us where is all those Miracles yes if that is so I am a mighty man of well why do I hide wheat in the wine press why do I hide wheat in the wine press you all go and read the Book of Judges the story of Gideon you understand when God talked to him he was just threshing wheat in the wine press somebody have read the story if you not go ahead and read it because it shows typically what the believer is today hallelujah hallelujah amen and then God came to him God spoke to him as he was threshing wheat in the wine press God came to him and told him thou Mighty Man of well now God in your condition that you are God comes down himself did God came down in this hour did God came down himself in this hour [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah first he sent the prophets as it was with Gideon you read your Bible Gideon had received the prophet and brother ROM says as Gideon was just reading a message book under a tree the Lord himself came [Applause] down hallelujah hallelujah amen so if you are busy with the message of the hour is a good chance that God comes straight to you hallelujah hallelujah amen and you understand then the Lord made himself known to Gideon finally Gideon understood this is the Lord himself talking to me now do you understand that this message is the Lord himself talking to you now can you believe what he said about [Applause] you hallelujah hallelujah can we believe what is written about us [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah come on Gideons while I was in when I was in my hotel I was I was again I was I saw two books laying there you know they put in every Hotel they put the new they put the New Testament amen and you know who does it they call themselves The Gideons so as I was in the hotel coming in and I looked at the book and I said The Gideons I said yeah here it is again amen amen where are The Gideons this morning where's a generation calls Gideons yes we have the words but we have we have it hard to [Music] believe be honest with all the circumstances it is not so easy to believe I mean you can say I believe but do you really [Music] believe amen amen and watch Gideon gon and then later we go back to Abraham but I just think it's a very good thing that we stay with that because that was the generation that was there amen could call themselves the last generation the last generation amen it was after Joshua had gone the Book of Judges begins with the death of Joshua and we understand today according to what the prophet said the holy spirit in laia that's the condition are we in laia this is the last Church age what was in the end of the church age the Holy Spirit had left the church he find himself outside the church is that not the condition today [Applause] is that not the condition today big crucid big Crusades lot of emotion but God is not there [Applause] anymore according to scripture this will be the condition of the church is it right amen Christ has left the church they have rejected the message of the hour amen the message of the is everywhere rejected only in some places it's still received but it's only been received as you are ready to come out of the church where do you find Jesus Jus Christ today outside of the church system that's why this church is not just a part of a headquarter no this church has no head no headship somewhere we are not part of a system anymore we have come out and only if you come out what did Paul said go out of every Camp there you meet him why do you meet him outside because he is kicked out they have rejected the message of the hour hallelujah hallelujah all the big leaders of denominations they have heard at least of William Bram they have heard of what God has done amen can we say Amen to that that's why today if you really want to receive him Revelation 17 or 18 he is calling come out of her my people come out of the systems when you come out of the system there you will meet him hallelujah hallelujah who's willing this morning to come out of every system who's willing this morning to come into Jesus Christ and the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's how you become a part of this church hallelujah hallelujah not only of this church in ginger but of the Bride of Jesus Christ mystical body that church church that knows no boundar that church that has no middle wall of petition that church where the word is stronger than culture I want to say that again that church where the word is stronger than any [Applause] culture there's no difference between black and white in Christ come on Church in Christ brother Steven and I we are brothers you know why we have the same father and his skin is black and mine is white but in Christ in Christ there's no difference we are not brothers because we have the same culture we are not brothers because we have the same habits we are brothers because we have the same father we are brothers because we are brothers by [Applause] [Music] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah amen am culture plays a big role in [Music] Africa culture plays a big role in Germany there's a strong spirit in Germany called the national German spirit and you have that in Africa you have strong spirits nationalistic you can see this this man comes from that area that man comes from that area amen am and that's our outside but that shouldn't rule the church because we are all baptized into one body and our national Spirits our home Spirits our spirits that we are living under is not an African spirit it's not a German Spirit it it's the Holy Spirit [Music] [Applause] himself hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen you see let's shortly stay with Gideon because it is this is so much a type of what the believer is today and as I said if you cannot believe God speaking to you gon wanted to believe him but the circumstances in life he said if God is with us why is all these problems [Music] that's a question you had amen am and he was right you know when he asked God where is all those Miracles that our father spoke of you know what God give him as an answer he said you go in your might that was God's answer go in your might go know who you are because you are the continuation of what your father's had and this is what God has telling her this morning do you believe this church today is it's a continuation of the book of Acts do you believe that do you believe that that Jesus Christ is the same today as he was 50 years ago do you believe he's the same hallelujah hallelujah amen amen but you see Gideon G he was still afraid and then suddenly you had a you know big following the church grew bigger they had 30,000 people and you know it's always becomes a mistake when we start counting how many people are in church mhm mhm oh our church is bigger than the brother's [Music] Church you know how God was so displeased with David when he was numbering the people you know why I trust you can get that as David was numbering the people one of his generals told him don't do that God don't like it if we are going by numbers and feel because we are so many that's why we are we we are we are we are right God don't like [Music] [Applause] that amen come on Church would you come to church if there would be five people in church would you be here this morning if there would only be five people [Laughter] here I tell you honest if five people would be here sitting I still would preach [Applause] sometimes on a Wednesday meeting at home we have 20 30 people sitting I'm still preaching sometimes we come to meetings in Europe you have five people in a home ask yourself a question would you be here this morning if only five people would be here would you be one of them we are not going by numbers church we are not trusting in [Music] numbers I know a Revival is going on in Uganda not because of numbers hallelujah hallelujah but I know a Revival is going on because the people come to know who they are the bright Revival cannot be counted in numbers it's never the quantity it's always the quality [Applause] so I count Revival in [Applause] [Music] quality praise God hallelujah hallelujah and I trust you can say I'm one of them you know what Jesus did to his disciples after 70 had left he came to the little group few Believers and he said do you also want to go he never asked him please stay hallelujah hallelujah he went and said do you want to go what Peter says to whom shall we go can we say the same thing together this morning as Peter said to shall be go you alone words of eternal life this message alone is the word of eternal life [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you hallelujah hallelujah and here Gideon was Again The Gideons are The Gideons here this morning that can hardly believe what the preacher is saying what the prophet is saying the prophet said the bright H H thus sayth the [Laughter] Lord do you have that say of the Lord do you have that say of the Lord how many times in our life when we go to circumstances we wished we say the Lord do we have that say the Lord oh my my my my may God help us to understand it comes to the Peak Church it comes to the peak amen only quality only the quality will [Music] stand remember brother brandom one day he was looking at a at a sign and the sign was it does not matter it does not matter how big the dog is in a fight it matters how big the fight is in the dog is it right sometimes you have these big dogs and they hardly can move because they are too fed you don't have to be scared of them but then you have these little dogs oh I saw little dogs fighting against big dog so doesn't matter how big the dog is what matters is how big the fight is in the door it doesn't matter how big the church is what is matters what kind of spirit is in the church hallelujah hallelujah what quality of spirit is in the church hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my Hallelujah you remember it was told to Moses in behalf of the Tabernacle it was told to him you know they had Lambs in the temple Lambs lambs is that right and God told him to have the Lambs burning constantly you need oil and important pure [Music] oil so it's not so important how much oil you have it's important what kind of quality you have Hallelujah and you can see sometimes you can be in a in a church and there quality of the spirit is very high hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and sometimes you find lot of human Spirit mixed within amen and when human spirit is mixed Within the oil is not pure again and the L and the Lord told Moses when you use oil to make the lamb burn constantly you have to have pure oil Hallelujah and this message is pure oil Hallelujah this message is the entire Holy [Applause] Ghost no human Spirit mixed [Applause] within hallelujah hallelujah amen so I care about the fight in the dark I don't care about the big dark in the fight when I want to see the quality you have then you have enough to win every [Applause] battle hallelujah hallelujah oh as I'm I'm going amen just finish that with Gideon because I think it's important because it's again the enemy church is the enemy now finally they had 30,000 Gideon had with him 30,000 so if you're 30,000 with you you feel strong you know what God said there's too many you know what Gideon said no there's not too many God said yes there's too many let them that are afraid go home so Gideon had to ask are you afraid who's afraid that goes home how many people went I believe 20,000 went I think 10,000 left and God said still too many gion said no God said yes too many opinions said many times when a church grows in numbers they come away from the real thing so don't look for numbers don't hide behind numbers don't hide behind numbers because God has chosen you so it comes back and back again it comes back and back again you know what the problem was when David was numbering the people soon as he has numbered the people God said because you have done this God was angry why was God angry not only because David didn't trust in God anymore yeah it's true he numbered the people because he didn't trust God if you trust God you don't need numbers amen amen but not only because of that God was angry with him because David had no trust in himself mm come on who killed the lion who killed the bear who killed Goliath uh-huh uh-huh and David now you are counting people let that sink he had already received the prophet where the message telling him who he is was he anointed was he anointed who anointed him the prophet who anointed us the prophet only Kings get anointed I want to repeat that when David was there he was about to anoint the first born yeah he was anointed the he was about to anoint the first born he was a big [Applause] guy and while he was going God said no don't him he's not the [Music] king only Kings get anointed is the message anointing you uhhuh uh-huh because when when when God said to Samuel go to Bethlehem go to Bethlehem take a horn of oil oil is a type of the Holy Ghost yes take a full horn not a drop not how full full hallelujah hallelujah come go to Bethlehem with the full words go to this church with the entire Holy [Applause] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah church let us wake up [Applause] so God was upset because David didn't believe and who he was God gets upset with you if you don't believe what he said about you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you can only please him when you believe him amen amen and after all this next step with Gideon okay sorry when I stay with that story but I just fell led to do it seriously I have not written that down that is not my subject this morning but it looks like we have a lot of Gideons amongst us but that means that you are the last generation that means you are the generation that will finish itall amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can we say praise the Lord if you don't believe me because it's too fantastic if you don't believe brother Steven because what he's saying is too fantastic then believe the enemy hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah m m m Lord help me I just pray Lord help me Lord help the people have open eyes he even let the enemy confess who you [Applause] are when I saw people rising up in Europe calling themselves the last generation I said Thank You Lord have we open eyes hallelujah hallelujah every we open eyes to see do you believe the Rapture is about to happen the change of our bodies can happen any moment the Rapture has started the Rapture has started the shout is done Thessalonians 4 4:16 he shall come down with a shout with a voice and a trumpet that the dead in Christ shall rise is that right the prophet said the voice the shout is my message is that right the Rapture started Church [Music] [Applause] [Music] finally the Trump of God shall sound allow me to say is sounding and the de in Christ shall rise first when they hear the Trump not Trump from America but when they hear the Trump of God you understand the Trump of God hallelujah and the Trump you understand that praise the Trump of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first the shout what's the message calling the people together what is bringing us together the message of the hour is that right and then with the voice of the Archangel the voice of the Archangel the voice of the Resurrection end with the Trump of God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and brother Ram said Jesus is doing all three things as he is [Applause] descending hallelujah hallelujah let us give the Lord a hand of praise let us the Lord why why because we living in the end time my my my we are lacking time it's always a problem time is never my friend amen amen and then Gideon remember 10,000 was left and God said there still too many bring them to the water bring them to the water are you baptized in the right name are you baptized in the wrong name watch what Gideon is doing look how brother RAM and watch if you're baptized in the titles this is a heeden tradition uh-huh uhhuh the disciples never have done that watch now as Gideon was bringing them to the water watch how how God is testing them said Gideon you watch how they are drinking some of them we're going to the water and drinking water out of the hand watching the scene watching and praying you know what some people did the majority the majority they fell flat and they were drinking like dogs Hallelujah you know what brother vam said and then Gideon had to choose those that was drinking with a hand he choos them all the others were sent home wrong baptized hey come on Church brother Ram said those they fell flat on their face had too much organization in them too much denominational understanding and with that denominational understanding with the wrong baptism God cannot use you only when you baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he can use you because then you go in full Authority you are baptized into his family then you a sign then you a signature is as good as his baptize them in the name not in the names but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of the L the name is Jesus baptize them in the name of the father in the name of the son the name of the Holy Ghost we all understand this is tradition hallelujah hallelujah and as those people with Gideon was falling flat on their face it looked very humble but God says I cannot use them hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen and you know how many people were left some 100 people some 100 people I think it was it was uh 300 some people was left out of 30,000 it's a small group amen and now Gideon Gideon was totally afraid Gideon said my I can never do that and God said God said okay Gideon if if you cannot believe me if you cannot believe the ministers if you cannot believe brother Steven if you cannot believe their ministers coming from outside did we not always preach did do the ministers in this ppose not always preach what the prophet has already said hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen I'm not coming to preach a different message I only preach what you hear me say is what he already said I'm not afraid to use [Applause] it what I told you is what brother Ram said he took Gideon you can read the story preached about him [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah I encourage you Church use if you have it use what you have use all what you have hallelujah hallelujah and if you take your Bible because there it is there's the story of Gideon go and read it and find yourself hallelujah hallelujah and then at night and God finally said Gideon if you can cannot believe God said to Gideon I never give up on you are you not happy that God is not giving up on you how many times we have failed how many times we are afraid how many times we are doubting brother bam says we are backsliding every day backsliding does not mean that you start drinking and smoking Adam was backslid Adam was backslid Adam was not drinking Adam was not smoking Adam was not committing adultery Adam was not listening to the wrong music and Adam was Fallen that's why God said Where Art Thou Adam Adam was backslid you know what backl means fallen from one position that's how brother bam said we backslide every day yes this is who we are we believe him and then something happens and then we backslide we feel how can I be what he said hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's why the Bible said the righteous will fall but they will raise up again I didn't get it is that [Applause] right my what but what I decided if I fall I don't stay too long on the ground you can decide for yourself if you want to stay on the ground happy days I decided when I when I fall when I think you cannot make it because of your ownself I quickly rise up and I say no he said about me I'm more than able to do it raise up again hallelujah hallelujah yes for the man fall the seven times and Rises up again but the wicked shall fall into Mischief with other words the wicked keeps laying down are we the righteous of God are we just come on what no and yes we are hallelujah hallelujah for a just man who is here can call himself a just man yes this is what you are at least this is what he died for hallelujah hallelujah can we say praise the Lord I trust I trust I get you a little bit out of your seats I I I trust this morning I can pull you out of your little comfort zone out of your little hiding place hallelujah allelujah amen this is what who The Gideons are they are the final generation they are the culmination they are the gathering together and if you cannot believe it as Gideon you know even when God told him go to the enemy Gideon was so afraid that he took his friend with him he was too afraid at night he said what can I do when they find me God said take your friend with so Gideon took his friend with him they was hi they was hiding between the tents of the enemy suddenly they hear the the Enemy talking one said you know I just had a strange dream I saw this is this happening falling into our camp and everything was a toold in our C and then the fr of the enemy said to him oh this can only be Gideon so when Gideon finally understood the enemy testifies of my position can we see today the enemy testifying who we are I was reading I don't have it with me here but I was reading in in an article not written by Believers not written by Believers written by scientists and they speak about the last generation they call them the generation zet zet you know Z is the last letter in our alphabet right you know what the last letter in God's alphabet is uhhuh God said Jesus said I am Alpha and Omega so Omega is the last letter and God's alphabet or in the Greek okay you have the scripture here I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end in our alphabet we have zet as the last and they call themselves The Last the ZET [Music] generation as they call themselves The Dead generation allow me to call you Omega [Applause] generation do you believe they are here and now watch now watch scientist science they say the next after that will be Alpha again hallelujah hallelujah so the Omega and the alpha is one and the same can we understand that the enemy is testifying Who You Are [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can we believe that I think we close I think we close Amen Let Us Stand Together [Applause] allow that to Sing Down the prophet would say about this last generation maybe we go this afternoon about to what I wanted to say this morning the last generation is the generation of Jesus Christ the generation of Jesus Christ started with Abraham you take Matthew 1 when you go home you read Matthew 1 the generation of Jesus Christ St with Abraham amen am amen from Abraham to David 14 Generations from David to Babylon 14 Generations you read your Bible from Babylon to Christ 14 Generations if you count carefully in the Bible there's only 13 Generations written out it's 13 Generations written out when it comes to Jesus Christ Hallelujah hall because Jesus Christ himself is part of that last [Music] generation heads and body are united this is the Oma generation this is where he said I am ala have you heard him in Revelation I am Alpha and I am Omega I am the beginning and I am the end end means not end but final he said I am the beginning not I have a beginning because God does not have a beginning he said I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end God never has a beginning and God never has an end but I am the beginning and I am the end that's about you you have never had the beginning but you are alpha and you are the Omega Christ and the church Hallelujah again I want to say where are The Gideons this
