[34:16] love. Amen. The pastor has been taking a
[34:19] few about love and affection one for
[34:27] another morning
[34:30] devotions. One time he was speaking
[34:32] about
[34:33] love and
[34:35] affection. Amen. Amen. And I had heard
[34:38] had this on my
[34:40] mind. I had had this on my
[34:44] mind. and he was speaking what the Lord
[34:47] has had put on my on my
[34:50] heart. So given opportunity
[34:53] tonight we shall be talking about
[34:56] love. Let's start the book of first John
[34:58] chapter
[35:06] 13. John 13 verse
[35:15] 34-35. Amen. Amen. The Bible says, "A
[35:20] new command, a new commandment I give
[35:23] unto you, that you love one another, as
[35:26] I have loved you, that you also love one
[35:37] another. And the New International
[35:40] Version
[35:41] says, "A new command I give
[35:49] you. Love one
[35:51] another as I have loved
[35:54] you. So you
[35:57] must love one
[36:02] another. By this everyone will know that
[36:06] you are my disciples.
[36:08] If you love one another.
[36:12] [Music]
[36:24] Yes. May the Lord add a blessed where we
[36:27] may get
[36:31] seated. Amen. Amen. So now we are
[36:33] talking about
[36:35] love and that's why I sang that song the
[36:38] love of
[36:40] God and the song writer was trying to
[36:47] express the understanding of the love of
[36:52] God. And he said it is greater a
[36:56] fact than human tongue can tell.
[37:03] In other words, we can't tell it
[37:06] all and says not even
[37:10] pain can attempt to write it and exist
[37:14] it. And he went ahead and
[37:17] said if the entire
[37:21] cloud was made a
[37:25] book and all the
[37:27] people praise the Lord writing sticks or
[37:32] pens and then all the
[37:37] oceans, all the lakes and
[37:40] rivers were made
[37:43] ink to try to write the love of
[37:48] God. He say the oceans would all dry
[37:53] up. All the legs would dry
[37:56] up. They could not they cannot attempt
[37:59] to write the love of God and exhaust
[38:03] it. Praise the Lord. How great it
[38:07] is. And then he said that now that he
[38:11] loved
[38:13] us with that same
[38:15] love and he called us with that same
[38:19] love. He says then express this same
[38:22] love one for
[38:26] another loved you. He said a new
[38:30] commandment I give unto
[38:32] you as you love one
[38:35] another as I have loved you.
[38:38] So you must love one
[38:41] another. Praise the Lord. Now when you
[38:44] love one
[38:46] another and you extend this same
[38:51] love, the rest of the
[38:54] people, we know that you are my
[38:58] disciples. Now we are known that we are
[39:00] the disciples of the
[39:03] Lord if we love one another.
[39:06] Praise the Lord. One another has no
[39:11] boundaries because the love of
[39:14] God, no boundaries, it is
[39:17] measurless. So now if it is
[39:20] measurless, he has given us the same
[39:22] measure of
[39:24] love. The love with which we should love
[39:27] one
[39:29] another
[39:31] boundaries. You have no reason. There's
[39:34] no excuse.
[39:36] Not loving your
[39:38] brother, not loving your
[39:40] sister, you must love one
[39:44] another. And then Romans
[39:48] 12:10, it says, "Be kindly affection one
[39:52] to another with bloody love in honor,
[39:56] preferring one another.
[40:07] Not lawful in business. Not lawful in
[40:10] business. Favor in spirit. Serving the
[40:13] Lord.
[40:28] Rejoicing in hope, patient in
[40:30] tribulation, continuing continuing
[40:32] instant in
[40:43] prayer. Verse
[40:45] 14, bless them which persecute you.
[40:48] Bless and c not.
[40:55] So the Bible principle here is
[40:58] love cast them that hate
[41:03] you them that persecute
[41:06] you said pray for
[41:09] them. Praise the Lord that persecute
[41:12] you. He says you must bless
[41:17] them and bless
[41:19] them because that is the only
[41:22] commandment that God has given unto
[41:25] those that believe
[41:27] him express love without
[41:31] measure. And he says, "Rejoice with them
[41:34] that do
[41:36] rejoice and weep with them that weep.
[41:41] Be of the same mind one toward
[41:45] another. Mind not high
[41:47] things, but condescent to men of low
[41:53] estate. Be not wise in your own
[41:58] conceit.
[42:03] Compens. Provide things honest in the
[42:06] sight of all men.
[42:10] If it be
[42:12] possible, as much as lies in
[42:16] you, live peacefully with all
[42:20] men. Even with those that curse
[42:23] you, bless them and live peacefully with
[42:28] them. Even those that hate you. The
[42:31] Bible says you have no another
[42:34] commandment but to love them. says when
[42:38] you love them, how shall the people
[42:42] know that you are my
[42:45] disciples? So now the love praise the
[42:49] Lord expresses Jesus
[42:52] Christ. It expresses the image of
[42:57] God. God himself is
[43:00] love. Praise the Lord out of his love
[43:05] because the Bible says that he left his
[43:09] throne out of
[43:12] love for a sinner like you and me out of
[43:17] love for a
[43:19] sinner full of
[43:23] mistakes. So he never looked at our
[43:26] mistakes but the love with which he
[43:28] loved
[43:29] us. He left his
[43:32] throne, all his
[43:34] glories, left all the
[43:36] power. And then he
[43:39] condescended into a
[43:42] son, express his love toward
[43:46] us. But he did not end there. He went
[43:50] ahead. He gave up his life for
[43:53] us. How can we explain such kind of
[43:56] love?
[44:00] So, since I loved
[44:02] you, I won't express the same love one
[44:05] for
[44:07] another shall be able to know that
[44:11] surely you are my
[44:13] disciples. Praise the living God. Now in
[44:16] 1 John
[44:18] 4 verse
[44:20] 6 verse around
[44:26] 13, he that loves not knows not
[44:30] God. If you do not have
[44:33] love, just if you do not have
[44:37] love, if you don't express
[44:39] love, you don't know God, it means you
[44:43] are not of God.
[44:46] If God himself is
[44:48] love, if God himself is
[44:51] love, then he dwells in you like the
[44:54] pastor has been preaching on the B of
[44:56] the Holy
[44:58] Spirit. That if indeed God is in
[45:02] you, spirit is in
[45:05] you, bear the fruits of the Holy
[45:09] Spirit. And the highest of it
[45:12] all is love.
[45:15] Praise the Lord. God express
[45:18] love. You need to check
[45:20] yourself. If you have hatred in your
[45:24] heart, examine yourself. Because if you
[45:27] don't
[45:28] love, it means you've not seen
[45:31] God. Means you have not known
[45:34] God. Them that have known
[45:37] God know that God is
[45:39] love. Praise the Lord. are of God. He
[45:44] that knoweth God heareth
[45:48] us. He that is not of God heareth us
[45:52] not. Hereby know we the spirit of truth
[45:56] and the spirit of
[45:58] error. Verse
[46:01] six. Okay. Sorry. First John
[46:21] Beloved, let us love one
[46:24] another. For love is of
[46:27] God. Praise the Lord. Let us love one
[46:30] another. Why?
[46:33] Not with
[46:36] pretense but an expression for from the
[46:41] inside which defines the person of
[46:44] you. Praise the Lording because the
[46:48] Bible has said I ought to love my
[46:52] brother. I ought love those that
[46:55] persecute me.
[46:59] that is a part of
[47:01] you. Praise the
[47:04] Lord. Love, let us love one
[47:08] another. Love is of
[47:11] God. And
[47:12] everyone that
[47:15] loveth born of God and knoweth
[47:19] God. Praise the Lord. That loveth
[47:23] not knoweth not
[47:25] God. Why? Because God is
[47:29] love. So if you do not
[47:32] love, you do not know
[47:35] God. You do not
[47:37] love come into that experience with the
[47:41] person of
[47:43] God. And because God himself is
[47:48] love, we have him in our
[47:51] lives. We shall extend the same love
[47:53] that is in us to one another.
[47:58] Praise the Lord. In this was manifested
[48:01] the love of God towards
[48:07] us because that God sent his only
[48:10] begotten son into the
[48:14] [Music]
[48:16] world that we might live through
[48:21] him. here in his
[48:25] love that we loved
[48:29] God that he loved
[48:33] us. He It is he that loved
[48:36] us. He loved you. He loved me. Praise
[48:41] the
[48:43] Lord. He loved each one of
[48:45] us. Praise the Lord. He that loved
[48:50] us thought that we loved
[48:53] him and then he sent his son to be the
[48:56] preparation for our
[48:59] sins. If he put no condition to love
[49:04] us, he put
[49:07] conditions to love one
[49:09] another. Praise the Lord. He has no
[49:13] boundaries. He put no
[49:16] boundary. when he loved you when he
[49:19] loved me. Listen close. If God had
[49:24] boundaries, some of us would not be
[49:28] here. If he had
[49:30] boundaries, where we would
[49:33] be a lot where God has brought
[49:37] us, he has brought
[49:40] us kind of grounds that he has brought
[49:44] us. that his love overlooked our family
[49:50] background overlooked the weaknesses of
[49:52] our
[49:56] parents. This is my
[49:59] beloved loved him. Then he loved us and
[50:03] he brought us to
[50:05] himself and did not end there. He took
[50:09] all our
[50:10] sins, all our
[50:12] infirmities, all the dark background
[50:15] that we
[50:17] had. He took it all unto the
[50:20] cross and then he set us
[50:23] free, that we are free
[50:26] indeed. It says to him to whom that the
[50:29] son has set
[50:33] free
[50:34] indeed. Praise the Lord.
[50:37] He has set you free by his love. That
[50:41] same love you can use to set free your
[50:45] brother. You can use it to forgive your
[50:50] brothers and those that fought against
[50:54] you. No man, no man has seen God at any
[50:59] time. If we love one
[51:02] another, God dwelleth in us.
[51:06] That is a
[51:07] symbol. That is a proof if we love one
[51:12] another that God dwells in
[51:15] us because the Bible has
[51:18] said God himself is
[51:21] love. So if God is love and he lives in
[51:25] me, I love you brother. I love you
[51:29] sister. I love everyone around
[51:32] me
[51:34] unconditionally because in me is love.
[51:38] In me is the source of
[51:41] love. If you love one another and if you
[51:44] love one
[51:45] another and God dwelt in
[51:48] us. Why? Because his love is perfected
[51:52] in
[51:56] us. It is perfected in us.
[52:00] in the
[52:02] angels. Praise the Lord. It is
[52:06] perfected for us when we love
[52:09] them. The Bible says they shall now
[52:14] know who are my disciples. It does not
[52:17] say love only those that love you and
[52:20] persecute you. Even those that hate you,
[52:24] love them. Those that speak against you,
[52:29] for them. That
[52:31] love will break the bond of hate in
[52:34] their
[52:37] lives. Love will cover all their
[52:41] imaginations against
[52:44] you. With
[52:46] them at thy feet, I'll give you a quote.
[52:50] I will not quote it. One of the
[52:53] messages the prophet was
[52:56] preaching. Praise the Lord. familiar
[52:58] with
[52:59] this as was
[53:02] preaching out came a
[53:04] man who was in
[53:06] sin. He was a mad man and he was
[53:10] known for killing
[53:13] people. He had killed so
[53:15] many as he was on the
[53:18] pit. The giant comes
[53:21] forth and now he started spitting
[53:25] fire blaspheming the prophet.
[53:28] But he never hated him.
[53:31] He there was an instrument.
[53:35] There was a power that dwelt in the
[53:38] prophet which same power dwells in us
[53:42] today that is the power of
[53:45] love at him. It says he had compassion
[53:49] over
[53:50] him. And when he started expressing
[53:54] compassion, he knew that it is not this
[53:57] man. But this, he knew that it is not
[53:59] this
[54:00] man, but this man is
[54:02] bound. Praise the Lord. Express love
[54:06] towards
[54:07] him and he fell at his feet. What was
[54:11] that? That was perfect
[54:14] love that covers all sins.
[54:19] But love all
[54:23] mistakes. With this shall all men
[54:27] know my
[54:29] disciples. With this shall all men know
[54:33] that you love
[54:35] me. I dwell in
[54:38] you. If you have love one for
[54:42] another. Praise the Lord. There is a
[54:45] question here.
[54:47] Praise the Lord. Now the
[54:50] commandment is that we should love one
[54:52] another
[54:55] unconditionally. Why do we have
[54:58] hate? Hate should not have any portion
[55:01] in our
[55:03] lives. Regardless of how much your
[55:06] brother has hurt
[55:09] you, love them. Have compassion over
[55:13] them. Praise the Lord.
[55:16] love that
[55:18] compassion, that compassion over
[55:21] them to compel them to come to you for
[55:27] forgiveness. Praise the Lord. Stand out
[55:31] there and say he must
[55:34] repent. The Bible does not like that. It
[55:37] says love them and pray for
[55:40] them and bless them. Praise the Lord for
[55:45] doing that love towards
[55:47] them. When a brother who has hurt
[55:52] you, who knows that they have hurt
[55:56] you sees you going to
[55:59] them with
[56:02] love without any
[56:05] hesitation, grabbing their hands,
[56:08] saying, "Oh, God bless you,
[56:10] brother." Expression of love.
[56:13] Hate in your
[56:15] eyes breaks down the heart of that
[56:20] brother hurt you come to
[56:24] repentance and that's how Christ calls
[56:26] the sinners
[56:29] repentance come towards their
[56:32] heart towards their
[56:35] soul wives and then that
[56:39] compassion compels them to come
[56:44] repentance. Praise the Lord. We must
[56:47] love one
[56:48] another. And there is no
[56:51] excuse for us not to love one
[56:54] another because says in so
[56:57] doing shall be able to
[57:00] express that God surely dwells in
[57:03] us. And he that does not
[57:06] love has not seen
[57:09] God. But if you have seen God,
[57:12] You will love
[57:13] them regardless of how much they have
[57:16] hurt you,
[57:17] brother. You will love them. You don't
[57:21] know how to express
[57:24] it. You will love them
[57:28] anyhow. Praise the Lord. One time I was
[57:31] somewhere
[57:34] recently pondering
[57:37] alone and I was
[57:39] praying and then it came to my
[57:42] mind. I' just been talking to a
[57:46] friend and he was telling me this
[57:49] time these people have hurt you so
[57:53] much. You have been forgiving them every
[57:55] time they hurt you. Bring them back.
[58:00] years you've lived with
[58:02] them. They hurt you so much, but still
[58:04] you forgive
[58:05] them and you don't
[58:08] end. But you still love them and do
[58:11] great things for them. Now this time we
[58:14] want to
[58:16] see them or
[58:19] not. He was invoking love towards
[58:23] them. I had compassion over them.
[58:28] Not them that are hurting
[58:30] me or trying to spray hat against
[58:34] me. The
[58:36] enemy because every sin
[58:39] person wants to express
[58:42] love. Everyone who knows
[58:45] God wants to express
[58:49] love not have
[58:50] God. Go ahead and hate one
[58:53] another. Go ahead and speak against one
[58:56] another.
[58:58] the enemy that is Satan. And now when we
[59:02] come to realize
[59:03] that he is
[59:06] whispering sentiments of
[59:10] hate, rebuke him right away. Why?
[59:14] Because
[59:15] God there is no
[59:18] hate. Love them. Forgive those that
[59:21] wrong against
[59:23] you. Don't just forgive them.
[59:26] But forgive them and love
[59:29] them. If you love them, God will touch
[59:32] their
[59:34] hearts. God will touch
[59:36] them and then they will be called to
[59:40] repentance. Rather, they may not tell
[59:42] you in your
[59:44] face in their hearts
[59:50] they because you expressed only
[59:54] love. Why? Because you are of
[59:58] God. Because you have
[1:00:00] God. Love one
[1:00:03] another.
[1:00:04] Friends, let us love one
[1:00:07] another. And you won't say you love one
[1:00:10] another. You only love those that are
[1:00:13] outside. If you only love those that are
[1:00:16] outside, but you don't love your brother
[1:00:19] in
[1:00:21] here. Praise the Lord. Regardless of
[1:00:24] whether they hurt you in the past or
[1:00:27] not, love them because they are your
[1:00:31] brother. And if you love them, you shall
[1:00:35] show the rest of the world. But surely
[1:00:38] God dwells in
[1:00:40] you. Because he says, if you love
[1:00:43] them, you shall be proving that I dwell
[1:00:46] in
[1:00:47] you. I
[1:00:49] myself, I am loved.
[1:00:53] Praise the
[1:00:54] Lord.
[1:00:56] 4:8 above all
[1:00:58] things above all things
[1:01:02] have favored charity.
[1:01:07] 48. Above all
[1:01:15] things, have favor charity among
[1:01:20] yourselves. For charity shall cover the
[1:01:23] multitude of
[1:01:26] sins. Above all things have
[1:01:32] favor. It is the capstone of
[1:01:36] everything. For he says that
[1:01:39] love, praise the Lord, have a multitude
[1:01:43] of
[1:01:45] sins. There is no sin that perfect love
[1:01:48] cannot
[1:01:52] cover. There is no there is no
[1:01:55] evil that perfect love cannot
[1:01:59] cover. There is no mountain
[1:02:03] that perfect love cannot
[1:02:07] move to love one
[1:02:09] another. He won't see the mistakes of
[1:02:12] one
[1:02:14] another. Christ loved
[1:02:16] us with that love. He's not able to see
[1:02:21] your
[1:02:23] mistakes. But he got himself
[1:02:26] up and he took himself upon the
[1:02:29] cross and he was hung up there.
[1:02:33] And then he bleed with
[1:02:34] blood. And then he got this
[1:02:37] blood and put it upon the
[1:02:40] altar at for our sins. For there is no
[1:02:44] mounted of
[1:02:45] sin that you have
[1:02:47] committed that this love that this
[1:02:51] blood cannot
[1:02:54] cover. Praise the Lord. All your
[1:02:57] weaknesses are covered in the blood. And
[1:03:01] how did he bring that
[1:03:02] blood? It was all for
[1:03:05] love because he loved us. He
[1:03:09] condescended and he came down to die for
[1:03:12] us. That is love. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:17] Notice because he loved us. That perfect
[1:03:20] love covers multitude of
[1:03:24] sins. He overlooked our sins. He
[1:03:27] overlooked our sins.
[1:03:30] He overlooked our
[1:03:32] mistakes. He overlooked our
[1:03:35] stature. And he loved us
[1:03:39] anyhow. And now the same
[1:03:42] love with which he loved us says greater
[1:03:48] things. That's what it says. He says
[1:03:50] greater
[1:03:51] things than
[1:03:53] this shall he do.
[1:03:57] Praise the Lord. He loved us. That means
[1:04:00] we have to express this love more than
[1:04:03] the love that he loved
[1:04:06] us. If his love has no
[1:04:10] measure, your love should have no
[1:04:14] measure. When it comes loving
[1:04:16] God, you should have no measure. When it
[1:04:20] comes to loving the things of
[1:04:22] God, you have no measure. When it comes
[1:04:25] loving your
[1:04:27] brother, loving your sister, you should
[1:04:30] have no
[1:04:32] measure. When it comes loving your
[1:04:35] enemies, you should not have any
[1:04:38] measure. You should not love
[1:04:40] them because the Bible has says love
[1:04:45] them. But you should love them because
[1:04:48] that's the nature that you are made
[1:04:51] of. You are of godly children.
[1:04:55] If you are of
[1:04:57] God, you are a product of
[1:05:00] love. If you are a product of love, you
[1:05:04] came out of love. So if you came out of
[1:05:08] love, we ought to express the same
[1:05:11] love as the rest of the
[1:05:14] world towards all
[1:05:16] sinners. If you love that
[1:05:19] sinner, you can be a workman.
[1:05:24] It can be a
[1:05:26] neighbor. It can be someone close to
[1:05:29] you. If you love them and you show
[1:05:34] perfect love towards
[1:05:37] them, it shall bring them to
[1:05:40] Christ. Because the Bible says the
[1:05:43] people shall
[1:05:44] know that you are my
[1:05:47] disciple. And if they know that you are
[1:05:49] my
[1:05:50] disciples, you will not end there. You
[1:05:54] will go ahead and point them with that
[1:05:57] same love. You'll point them towards
[1:06:01] Christ. Love your
[1:06:03] brothers, not your enemies. Even those
[1:06:06] that persecute you, love them anyhow.
[1:06:11] Regardless of their
[1:06:12] weaknesses, regardless of their
[1:06:14] mistakes,
[1:06:16] ought to love them anyhow.
[1:06:19] that love shall break that
[1:06:23] yoke and he shall bring them to
[1:06:27] Christ. Let that
[1:06:29] love Let that
[1:06:31] love, the brotherly
[1:06:33] love with which you love
[1:06:37] them, cover their
[1:06:40] mistakes. Praise the
[1:06:42] Lord. Perfect love covers a multitude of
[1:06:45] sins.
[1:06:48] If it be so that your brother has sinned
[1:06:51] against
[1:06:52] you and if you love them before they
[1:06:56] approach you
[1:06:58] brother love them. Praise the Lord
[1:07:02] before they come and say
[1:07:04] sorry. Love them and express that love
[1:07:07] towards
[1:07:09] them. make it easy for them to come and
[1:07:13] say, "I'm sorry, brother."
[1:07:16] Because if you love them, you have cut a
[1:07:20] boundary, you have to narrow the
[1:07:23] gap for them to come and reconcile with
[1:07:27] you. Love them and
[1:07:33] express acts of love towards
[1:07:37] them in the message taking sides with
[1:07:40] Jesus.
[1:07:42] Now those who believed the
[1:07:46] word, they knowed that the very things
[1:07:49] that Jesus was
[1:07:52] doing and the things was of his
[1:07:55] life, they knew who he
[1:07:58] was. So they couldn't put nothing blight
[1:08:01] on
[1:08:03] him. Praise the Lord. But they couldn't
[1:08:06] see
[1:08:07] it. If you love somebody,
[1:08:11] That love covers their mistakes and
[1:08:13] their
[1:08:15] sin. Saying those that love
[1:08:18] Jesus would not put any blood on
[1:08:21] him. They could not see any mistakes
[1:08:24] with
[1:08:25] him. And if he said except you eat my
[1:08:31] flesh, eat my
[1:08:33] blood. No part of me. I never saw that
[1:08:36] as
[1:08:38] cannibalism. Praise the Lord because
[1:08:41] they loved him. They never even thought
[1:08:44] of it in the evil
[1:08:47] way. That
[1:08:50] love every mistake and every
[1:08:54] error you love me. Even if I go wrong in
[1:08:59] my
[1:09:01] speech, what you have towards
[1:09:04] me will cover it
[1:09:06] up. Praise the Lord. Prophet says they
[1:09:10] never saw it. They couldn't put nothing
[1:09:13] on
[1:09:14] him because they couldn't see
[1:09:17] it. And you know love is blind
[1:09:23] anyhow is blind on them
[1:09:27] things. That's what we say. Love is
[1:09:32] blind. That's a common saying among the
[1:09:37] people somebody
[1:09:39] You won't see their
[1:09:41] mistakes. If you love somebody while
[1:09:45] others don't love
[1:09:47] them, they see this person's
[1:09:50] eye doesn't see or this person has big
[1:09:55] eyes or this person have has a
[1:09:58] deformation with their
[1:10:01] teeth. Maybe they
[1:10:04] are. But you because you love them.
[1:10:09] you won't see that
[1:10:13] information because you love
[1:10:15] them. But they that don't love
[1:10:18] them see the
[1:10:20] information that's why the world they
[1:10:24] say is blind.
[1:10:28] If the world
[1:10:29] knows that love is
[1:10:32] blind, how about we have tested of the
[1:10:36] goodness of the
[1:10:38] Lord and have tested of the love of
[1:10:43] God also
[1:10:46] blind. Our love towards one
[1:10:48] another is also
[1:10:52] blind. Lord, see the mistakes of your
[1:10:55] your brothers.
[1:10:58] If they rush in the
[1:11:00] night, they rush in the
[1:11:02] night. If they run in the
[1:11:04] night, comes to you and tells you, you
[1:11:07] know what? I have seen brother
[1:11:11] Caleb stealing someone's
[1:11:14] tomatoes. I have found him in the
[1:11:17] garden. Say, "Oh,
[1:11:19] brother, that's very bad of you because
[1:11:24] you don't want to accommodate
[1:11:27] every single
[1:11:29] thought negative about brother
[1:11:33] Khal and the brother as the person who
[1:11:35] has brought the news
[1:11:38] leaves praise the Lord won't let that
[1:11:41] stick in your
[1:11:43] mind and when you meet
[1:11:46] brother old
[1:11:48] brother the other day that you saw
[1:11:51] someone in
[1:11:53] tomatoes your love towards him will find
[1:11:58] ways to bring the brother's weakness to
[1:12:01] their
[1:12:04] attention. You will pray for them.
[1:12:07] Praise the Lord. You go to check on
[1:12:10] them. You call to pray with
[1:12:13] them. Praise the Lord. That love does
[1:12:17] not allow a boundary to come in
[1:12:21] between committed this mistake.
[1:12:25] say he's a
[1:12:27] sinner. He is a thief. He is not a thief
[1:12:32] because he was not a thief from the
[1:12:34] beginning. He's a child of God and you a
[1:12:38] child of God. You shall love them on the
[1:12:43] condition of the condition that they are
[1:12:47] a child of God like you
[1:12:51] are. Love is blind.
[1:12:54] The prophet says he says love covers up
[1:12:58] a mountain of
[1:13:00] sin perfect love cast out
[1:13:04] fear and sin and all
[1:13:08] discord love does.
[1:13:14] Now this blind man was sitting
[1:13:18] there blind blind
[1:13:22] m you know when he when Jesus was
[1:13:25] moving and his
[1:13:27] disciples and they find this blind man.
[1:13:31] said, "Maybe because of his
[1:13:36] background, maybe because his fathers
[1:13:38] were
[1:13:40] sinners, maybe because their family are
[1:13:44] sinners, maybe he went out of
[1:13:48] grace. That's why he's
[1:13:50] blind." Praise the Lord. Jesus never
[1:13:54] accepted to accommodate any of their
[1:13:57] sayings.
[1:13:59] that blind. But Moes loved
[1:14:03] him. And the prophet says, "This blind
[1:14:07] man sitting right
[1:14:08] there." Jesus said, "And his disciples
[1:14:11] come
[1:14:14] by." And I think Jesus gave them a
[1:14:17] little lesson there.
[1:14:20] When they seen this poor blind man, they
[1:14:25] thought surely there is a sin behind
[1:14:28] that
[1:14:32] somewhere. The
[1:14:34] suffering of your
[1:14:36] brother,
[1:14:38] tribulations. Praise the Lord. Not
[1:14:41] because they are
[1:14:43] sinners. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:46] Sometimes it works out our
[1:14:50] faith. Praise the Lord. Now when they
[1:14:53] looked at
[1:14:53] him, there should be a sin behind
[1:14:57] somewhere and we see something happen to
[1:14:59] a
[1:15:00] man. When we see something happen to a
[1:15:04] man say, well, he
[1:15:08] sinned. Maybe he got out of the will of
[1:15:11] the Lord somewhere.
[1:15:15] When brother hit the
[1:15:18] post, when brother hit the
[1:15:23] post, he got out of the will of the Lord
[1:15:28] somewhere somebody's
[1:15:32] idea. When the gun blowed up on
[1:15:37] me, well, he was out of the will of the
[1:15:40] Lord.
[1:15:43] That's what say when the when when the
[1:15:45] gun blew blew out of him up on
[1:15:51] him someone's
[1:15:53] mind brother Neville hit the
[1:15:57] car. He was out of the the will of
[1:16:01] God. That's not exactly
[1:16:04] right. God permits those
[1:16:07] things. And now we are not a perfect
[1:16:10] people.
[1:16:11] We make our
[1:16:13] mistakes. We do things that's
[1:16:15] wrong. But you see, love covers all
[1:16:25] that. We are
[1:16:27] willing. When we see our
[1:16:31] mistakes, come back and apologize to one
[1:16:35] another like
[1:16:39] and reconcile with one
[1:16:41] another. That is
[1:16:46] warriors. That's the
[1:16:49] reality. That's really men and women.
[1:16:51] That's gallant.
[1:16:59] That's what they do. Anybody can go out
[1:17:02] to the
[1:17:04] battlefield that's got n enough to go
[1:17:07] walk out
[1:17:09] there. That that has got nerve enough to
[1:17:12] walk up
[1:17:16] there. But when he gets knocked
[1:17:20] down, then get up and try again.
[1:17:24] See, there used to be a song that a
[1:17:26] young man and young woman used to sing
[1:17:28] in the
[1:17:38] church. If I
[1:17:40] fall or if I
[1:17:42] fail, let me rise and try
[1:17:47] again. So he said, when a man gets
[1:17:50] up, he is decided
[1:17:53] to go to the battle.
[1:17:56] Praise the Lord. He has got the
[1:17:59] nerve. He's been trained
[1:18:02] enough. When he reached the
[1:18:05] battlefield, he's knocked down. He
[1:18:09] doesn't give up. He rises up
[1:18:12] again. Try it
[1:18:15] again. He
[1:18:17] rises. You try again.
[1:18:20] The prophet says, "If I fall or if I
[1:18:25] fail, let me
[1:18:27] rise and try
[1:18:30] again." Praise the Lord. The message,
[1:18:33] the power of
[1:18:36] transformation. That's my
[1:18:39] theme. His love covers it
[1:18:42] all. I believe in the redeeming love of
[1:18:44] the Lord Jesus.
[1:18:47] I like this song and I like this
[1:18:51] song. Ever since my by faith I saw the
[1:19:01] stream thy flowing wounds
[1:19:05] supply redeeming love has been my
[1:19:11] theme. It shall be till I die.
[1:19:17] I'd rather have a
[1:19:20] church in just a
[1:19:22] moment. I would rather have a
[1:19:27] church. I would rather have a
[1:19:29] church that knows nothing about any
[1:19:32] spiritual
[1:19:39] gifts and just be so in love with each
[1:19:42] other with Christ.
[1:19:46] and with Christ. I would rather have
[1:19:49] that. I would rather I would rather have
[1:19:51] that than every spiritual gift operating
[1:19:54] in the
[1:19:58] church. Now that might sound hard in a
[1:20:02] Pentecostal
[1:20:07] group. I would rather have
[1:20:13] it. Where there is
[1:20:18] gifts, they will
[1:20:20] fail. Where there is
[1:20:22] gifts, they will bring
[1:20:25] confusion. Where there is gifts, they
[1:20:28] can be
[1:20:29] questioned. But where there is
[1:20:33] love, it is
[1:20:35] perfect. That's right. And if you had
[1:20:39] perfect
[1:20:40] love, you would have perfect
[1:20:44] gifts. That's right. So work fast with
[1:20:50] love that brings
[1:20:53] fellowship. Fellowship brings
[1:20:58] gifts. Have a
[1:21:01] church that has
[1:21:03] love. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:06] Love is a powerful instrument in our
[1:21:12] faith. Men can have gifts in the
[1:21:16] church. Gifts can bring
[1:21:22] confusion. If there is
[1:21:27] love, that love brings
[1:21:30] fellowship. It brings brethren
[1:21:33] fellowship.
[1:21:36] It brings reverence to live in one
[1:21:40] accord. And now that
[1:21:43] fellowship which is a product of
[1:21:46] love brings
[1:21:50] gifts. Praise the Lord
[1:21:54] first of Christ. Christ never loved us
[1:21:59] because we have
[1:22:00] gifts. But again he says if you have
[1:22:04] gifts you must serve diligently among
[1:22:07] your
[1:22:10] brethren. It had to start with
[1:22:14] love. It had to be
[1:22:19] love of God that he loved us and he
[1:22:24] imparts that
[1:22:26] love in each one of us that we can have
[1:22:30] fellowship.
[1:22:32] one with
[1:22:33] another we have
[1:22:35] fellowship one with another we shall
[1:22:38] bring gifts in our
[1:22:41] midst of
[1:22:46] evangelism. Praise the Lord
[1:22:51] pastorship
[1:22:53] prophecy those
[1:22:55] gifts we bring together the body of
[1:22:58] Jesus Christ.
[1:23:01] It does not start with
[1:23:03] gifts. It has to start with
[1:23:07] love. That's what the prophet says.
[1:23:10] Rather have a
[1:23:12] church that has love than a
[1:23:16] church on
[1:23:18] gifts.
[1:23:20] Why gift shall
[1:23:22] fail? The love of God shall never fail.
[1:23:27] That same love shall bring us
[1:23:31] together. That same love shall bring the
[1:23:34] fellowship of
[1:23:36] brothers. You shall forgive your
[1:23:39] brother who has done you
[1:23:41] wrong. Praise the Lord. Forgive
[1:23:45] those that persecute you and he shall
[1:23:49] bring them that love. God shall bring
[1:23:53] them
[1:23:55] fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Love one
[1:24:00] another the way to have
[1:24:04] fellowship. The prophet says, "And now
[1:24:08] that's what we've got to do
[1:24:10] now. Let's just break down all
[1:24:13] differences
[1:24:15] everywhere and just get
[1:24:18] ourself. You just can't put it on.
[1:24:23] It's got to come from the
[1:24:24] [Music]
[1:24:26] inside. Why? Because it is of
[1:24:30] God. It is God
[1:24:32] himself. So if it is God
[1:24:35] himself and God dwells in
[1:24:38] you by way of the Holy
[1:24:41] Spirit, then it has come from the
[1:24:45] inside. Express it the rest of the
[1:24:49] people. Because when you put it on, it
[1:24:52] will wear
[1:24:54] out. You can put it on one
[1:24:58] day, two days, and when trouble comes,
[1:25:02] when your brother annoys
[1:25:05] you, it
[1:25:07] disappears and then you begin
[1:25:09] flexing. There is no love
[1:25:12] there, it allow it to go in on the
[1:25:17] inside. Allow God to go on the inside.
[1:25:21] begins to operate from inside
[1:25:24] out. Express the love of
[1:25:28] brethren. Remember, the Holy Spirit
[1:25:31] knows it. Whether it's coming from the
[1:25:35] inside, let's just get all the
[1:25:37] differences
[1:25:39] away. Walk right
[1:25:41] out and say, "I love the
[1:25:45] Lord, and I love even my enemies.
[1:25:50] If anyone says anything about
[1:25:53] you, don't let that bother you at
[1:25:57] all. Don't m that wonderful feeling till
[1:26:00] God. Don't m that wonderful
[1:26:05] feeling my just just go
[1:26:10] ahead love them. And
[1:26:12] how praise the lord that's what perfect
[1:26:16] love is.
[1:26:18] Love them. If they marry
[1:26:21] you, they speak about
[1:26:23] you, not even bother
[1:26:26] you, go
[1:26:28] ahead and love them.
[1:26:30] Anyhow in the message
[1:26:33] expectation, he says, what does
[1:26:36] it what good does
[1:26:39] it do
[1:26:42] anyhow? What good is it going to do
[1:26:45] anyhow for you to get all paved up about
[1:26:54] things? Just love them
[1:26:56] anyhow. Love
[1:26:58] everybody because they are the purchased
[1:27:01] of the blood of Jesus
[1:27:04] Christ. Whether they are
[1:27:06] sinners or they are
[1:27:09] saints, they are the purchase of the
[1:27:12] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:15] and then you'll be able to win them to
[1:27:19] God. They will
[1:27:22] realize that you really love
[1:27:26] them. Loving
[1:27:28] sinners says love them
[1:27:31] anyhow. And if you love them, it will
[1:27:34] make them
[1:27:36] realize. Praise the
[1:27:38] Lord. Love them. then you will them over
[1:27:42] to
[1:27:44] God. That's what we need
[1:27:47] today. Don't you think so?
[1:27:51] Yes, sir. And again, he says in Proverbs
[1:27:55] 193, if there is sin in your
[1:27:59] heart, if there is a fault in your
[1:28:02] heart, if you've got
[1:28:05] anything, pray now and ask God forgive
[1:28:08] you.
[1:28:11] You pray for me, I'll pray for you. God
[1:28:15] bless you is my
[1:28:17] prayer. And that is a prayer that comes
[1:28:20] from
[1:28:21] love. Knowing that my brother has
[1:28:25] sinned or he has sinned against
[1:28:28] me, I will pray for
[1:28:31] them. And he says also pray for
[1:28:34] me and say God bless you.
[1:28:38] That should be our
[1:28:40] prayer. Bless
[1:28:43] everyone. Do you love one
[1:28:45] another? John said, "Little
[1:28:48] children one
[1:28:50] another. Love one another for love
[1:28:54] covers a multitude of
[1:28:57] sins." And so he says, "Let us shake one
[1:28:59] another's
[1:29:01] hand and say, God be with
[1:29:04] you. God bless you.
[1:29:08] expressing love for one
[1:29:11] another and in
[1:29:16] message love your
[1:29:18] neighbor as you love yourself that's the
[1:29:23] commandment express love for
[1:29:27] yourself how do you express love for
[1:29:30] yourself if you love
[1:29:33] yourself says that same love
[1:29:37] of your
[1:29:38] neighbor, the same love for brothers,
[1:29:42] that same love for
[1:29:45] sisters, every
[1:29:47] sinner. How much do you love
[1:29:51] yourself? How much you should love
[1:29:55] others? Reflect on that
[1:29:57] thought. Reflect on that
[1:30:03] thought. How much do you love yourself?
[1:30:07] You care about yourself so
[1:30:09] much. You don't want to go
[1:30:12] hungry. You don't want to get
[1:30:15] dirty. You don't want God speak ill
[1:30:17] about
[1:30:18] you. You want to be
[1:30:22] positive. Good thing to come to
[1:30:24] you. Praise the Lord. Receive the
[1:30:27] blessings of
[1:30:29] God. Love
[1:30:31] yourself. Praise the Lord. Love
[1:30:34] yourself.
[1:30:35] and you love good things for
[1:30:37] yourself and you love good things for
[1:30:40] yourself and you love blessings to come
[1:30:43] to
[1:30:44] you. The same you should love for your
[1:30:48] brothers. Pray for them if they are
[1:30:51] wrong. You bless them and God may bless
[1:30:55] them. They in
[1:30:57] need. The Bible says come to their
[1:31:02] supply. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:04] the
[1:31:05] ability supply those that I
[1:31:09] need don't want to
[1:31:12] lack that is the act of
[1:31:16] love expressing love one for
[1:31:19] another so how do you express love for
[1:31:23] yourself can you backstab
[1:31:26] yourself can you backbite
[1:31:28] yourself can you speak ill of
[1:31:32] yourself do you feel others bad about
[1:31:38] yourself. Can you go to a friend and
[1:31:40] tell him how bad you
[1:31:43] are? Can you tell the people how you
[1:31:46] hate
[1:31:48] yourself? So now if you can't do the
[1:31:51] things about
[1:31:54] yourself, you ought not to do them about
[1:31:59] others. Because you love yourself, you
[1:32:02] also have to love
[1:32:04] others and wish them
[1:32:06] good, bless them and love them. Because
[1:32:11] if you can backstab
[1:32:13] yourself, it means you you have you are
[1:32:16] mentally
[1:32:19] disturbed
[1:32:21] derangement and you need medication.
[1:32:25] Same
[1:32:26] person can't hurt
[1:32:29] themselves. You can't say this
[1:32:32] hand, this hand is useless to me and you
[1:32:36] cut it
[1:32:37] off. This leg I was walking and then I
[1:32:41] knocked
[1:32:43] myself
[1:32:45] off yourself. So you can't hurt your
[1:32:50] brother. You are so mindful about
[1:32:53] yourself.
[1:32:55] So you must be mindful about your
[1:32:56] brothers and
[1:32:59] sisters. This is the greatest
[1:33:02] commandment. Love one
[1:33:05] another. Love your
[1:33:07] neighbor. Love
[1:33:09] yourself. Love them
[1:33:11] anyhow because that's what you must
[1:33:16] do. Praise the living God. The prophet
[1:33:19] has
[1:33:20] said never have such a church.
[1:33:25] built on
[1:33:26] love that is built upon the foundation
[1:33:28] of
[1:33:29] love than built on the foundation of
[1:33:33] gifts
[1:33:35] because shall
[1:33:38] fail shall fail with
[1:33:41] man
[1:33:43] love brings men
[1:33:46] together. Jesus
[1:33:49] Christ bring us
[1:33:51] together. Let that love
[1:33:53] Bring us in support one for
[1:33:57] another love. Bring us in support for
[1:34:01] the work for the work of the
[1:34:06] ministry in the local
[1:34:08] church and in the rest of the
[1:34:11] churches. Let that love bind us
[1:34:17] together. Why? Because it shall always
[1:34:20] bring fellowship.
[1:34:24] With
[1:34:25] this shall men
[1:34:27] know that you are my
[1:34:30] disciples when you have love one for
[1:34:34] another. May the Lord bless you. Amen.
[1:34:39] Amen.
[1:34:41] Amen. Amen. Let's get on our
[1:34:44] feet. Amen. Amen. And the brother shall
[1:34:47] lead us in
[1:34:50] worship. Amen. I want to appreciate the
[1:34:52] presence of our
[1:34:56] pastor. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:59] Amen. I was I was at the barrier
[1:35:01] somewhere.
[1:35:06] Actually, pastor was coming to
[1:35:10] preach. Pastor was coming to
[1:35:12] preach and then he had a few things here
[1:35:15] and there to
[1:35:18] fix. Long trip to make tonight.
[1:35:23] So we talked in the
[1:35:25] morning when he was coming to
[1:35:27] preach and
[1:35:30] somehow so many things came
[1:35:33] up. So he called me to come and and
[1:35:37] preach but I was
[1:35:40] organizing because I lost one of my
[1:35:42] grand my
[1:35:45] grandfathers. So I I was running to go
[1:35:47] and attend the barrier.
[1:35:51] I couldn't tell pastor I'm not
[1:35:53] here. So I had to
[1:35:56] run. I had people that were waiting for
[1:35:59] me outside where I
[1:36:01] was to the barrier. So I ran fast when I
[1:36:06] was there. Pastor Pastor Ammon saw me
[1:36:10] somewhere called me and said please
[1:36:14] come. He has come and such and such a
[1:36:16] spot.
[1:36:18] knew he had a message for
[1:36:20] me but because of the
[1:36:23] noise tell him it was actually
[1:36:26] 4 around
[1:36:29] 4:23 telling him I have something I was
[1:36:31] I was going to
[1:36:33] do around for him I could not see
[1:36:36] him and started
[1:36:39] driving because the time was already
[1:36:43] up that God gives me grace to call him
[1:36:46] after
[1:36:48] Yeah, that he has
[1:36:50] come out of our
[1:36:54] service. May God bless you.
[1:36:58] Amen. Amen. So let the brother lead us.
[1:37:00] I would love to sing that song. The love
[1:37:02] of God.
[1:37:05] So may the Lord bless us with
[1:37:08] love, love one
[1:37:10] another, to love our
[1:37:14] friends, to love our
[1:37:17] brethren, to love the
[1:37:19] ministry, love the
[1:37:22] ministers and bring that love of God
[1:37:28] manifestation. Build our church upon
[1:37:30] love.
[1:37:35] It shall never fail. Men may
[1:37:38] fall, but because of that love in our
[1:37:42] midst, the ministry shall keep
[1:37:46] growing. Amen. God bless
[1:37:56] you. God bless you so much. Thank you
[1:37:59] for your patience. I just feel small to
[1:38:03] see the sense of God being like humble
[1:38:08] and stay for this long. May God add a
[1:38:11] blessing upon
[1:38:13] you. Let us sing that song. The love of
[1:38:19] God. Let us maintain it. Amen.
