[0:00] takes over your
[0:01] weaknesses the Lord comes and takes over
[0:03] your
[0:05] failures you know we need to allow the
[0:07] Lord
[0:08] himself when read in
[0:11] Jeremiah 2 said they forsaken me the
[0:15] living so if you are forsaking the
[0:18] living
[0:19] Fountain you need to desire the living
[0:21] Fountain say Lord I open up my heart
[0:25] keep keep flowing in me keep flowing me
[0:29] keep changing me
[0:30] keep transforming me allow the Holy
[0:33] Spirit to come down in your life praise
[0:37] the name of our Lord and will the Holy
[0:39] Ghost come if you don't give
[0:42] God time your special time your quiet
[0:48] time seek the Lord meditate upon the
[0:52] Lord you know read the word hear the
[0:56] message praise the name of our Lord and
[0:58] when you hear the word
[1:00] obey that one the Bible says blessed
[1:04] that day in Revelations 1: blessed are
[1:09] they that
[1:10] hear and read and
[1:14] do there's a
[1:16] blessing praise the name of our Lord
[1:18] surrender yourself yield yourself be
[1:22] more
[1:24] sincere praise the name of and when
[1:26] brother said oh God
[1:28] have then his body was
[1:32] charged praise the name of our Lord and
[1:35] the Bible says as many ased
[1:38] him to them he gave
[1:41] power and God still gives us the
[1:44] power praise the name of now the power
[1:48] God gives us is not to fall
[1:50] down praise the name of you know the
[1:53] mindset of has been
[1:58] changed power of God is coming and the
[2:02] hand
[2:04] and and then they all
[2:08] fall man but that same man is committing
[2:11] a
[2:13] doubt why is that power of God which
[2:15] cannot save him
[2:18] from he doesn't have that
[2:21] power because the power we
[2:24] receive transforms Us Praise the name of
[2:27] our Lord It's the power
[2:30] that gives you the
[2:32] ability not to sin that's the power
[2:36] praise the name of and is the power of
[2:38] God that keeps
[2:40] us in the midst of
[2:42] Temptations and then you are able to
[2:44] overcome that
[2:45] temp praise the name of our Lord so just
[2:48] yield yourself and then the Lord will
[2:50] give you that
[2:51] power the
[2:58] power
[3:00] I can do and
[3:05] thenar by the names of
[3:13] their there's no
[3:16] brother praise the name of
[3:25] Lord if you don't drink the wine you're
[3:28] not that's not
[3:31] confession praise the name of the Lord
[3:33] let us get the power of God that even
[3:37] change our
[3:39] thinking from the traditions we have
[3:41] grown from the societies we have
[3:44] lived praise the name of our Lord you
[3:47] may live in a society and it is evil
[3:50] things there but even when there is evil
[3:53] there God can raise something good out
[3:57] praise the name of so you don't say now
[4:00] for me my family everybody was dying
[4:03] when they are young don't take that
[4:06] confession we have being given the power
[4:09] to break all chains of Satan power to
[4:12] break all cures power to break all
[4:16] failures power to break all weaknesses
[4:19] we still have that power and that power
[4:22] still comes praise the name of our Lord
[4:25] so you get that power where you can
[4:28] rebuke the devil and said Satan this
[4:31] thing is not going to happen praise the
[4:34] name of our Lord and then your brother
[4:36] Bram was being
[4:38] told how to
[4:40] bind and unbind
[4:42] Satan praise the name of our Lord and
[4:45] then he
[4:47] said and then he started toward watch
[4:51] me and he couldn't and he couldn't do
[4:54] it I said Satan in the name of the Lord
[4:59] Jesus Christ I bind you praise the name
[5:03] of our Lord and then the
[5:06] serpent a blue smoke flew out of
[5:11] him and he C up and made a sign like
[5:17] S capital S
[5:20] backwards and
[5:24] sign and that and that means bind this
[5:29] one
[5:30] or anything below
[5:32] him praise the name of our Lord we have
[5:35] been given the power to bind Satan you
[5:39] can bind Satan in your life or any acts
[5:42] of Satan in your life you can bring them
[5:45] down the name of our and said devil I
[5:50] you in the name of Jesus devil you have
[5:53] no power over
[5:54] me you have no authority over me praise
[5:58] the name of the Lord the Bible says he
[6:01] has made us
[6:02] priests praise the name of our Lord a
[6:05] priest you confess and you take
[6:09] possession praise the name of the Lord
[6:11] that's what the Lord has made us and
[6:14] then he
[6:16] said you have been given power to bind
[6:18] him on those that are below
[6:22] him because he was the
[6:25] worst the blue smoke fell out of him
[6:30] and his tail choked his own self to
[6:32] death around his
[6:35] head and when he made his
[6:40] backward like a
[6:43] conjunction it chocked it to
[6:46] death and the brother was
[6:49] free praise the name of so we can set
[6:53] others
[6:55] free when we have Christ in us we can
[6:59] set our family
[7:00] fre when we are in the more excellent
[7:03] way we need to desire the Bible says
[7:09] love love doesn't
[7:12] fail whatever sttion you may be
[7:16] first have the love of God that's the
[7:19] more excellent way you desire it desire
[7:23] that love don't have in mind to hate
[7:27] somebody don't have in mind to think
[7:29] about somebody if that evil thoughts
[7:32] come if that evil imagination come cry
[7:35] to the Lord to deliver you out say Lord
[7:39] help me Lord deliver me it doesn't
[7:42] matter if they are talking bad about it
[7:44] doesn't matter if they against you pray
[7:47] for them and love them praise the name
[7:51] of our Lord and then he said and I went
[7:54] over and smashed on
[7:56] it that's paragraph 17 I've go to find
[8:00] out about
[8:01] this because it's a
[8:03] vision and I hit on the
[8:06] thing and it turned like I looked like
[8:09] it looked like a
[8:11] handle a glass handle on a
[8:16] picture solid
[8:18] Crystal I said I think of
[8:21] that how quick the blue smoke was
[8:27] life and everything it
[8:30] left all
[8:33] elements turned to Glass and then a
[8:36] voice
[8:38] said again you can unbind him
[8:44] also so I
[8:46] said Satan that I might
[8:50] know I unbind you and when it did he
[8:55] started coming to life
[8:58] again
[9:00] and then I said I bind you back in the
[9:04] name of Jesus and when it did the smoke
[9:07] went out of him again and choked himself
[9:10] right back again and turned to Crystal
[9:14] and when he had that the voice said now
