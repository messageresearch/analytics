[25:43] of the
[25:48] Lord can turn to our
[25:51] Bibles praise the name of our Lord I
[25:54] just want to take only one hour God
[25:56] being gracious
[25:59] say that we give enough room for the
[26:01] Breen who are traveling
[26:05] far so we got the Book of John Chapter
[26:12] 13 John Chapter
[26:17] 13 and then we are
[26:19] reading from verse S
[26:30] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[26:34] do thou knowest not now but thou sh know
[26:45] here Peter said unto him thou shall
[26:48] never wash my feet Jesus answered him if
[26:51] I wash thee not thou shall have no part
[26:55] with me
[27:05] Simon P said unto him Lord not my feet
[27:08] only but also my hands and my
[27:17] head Jesus said unto him he that is
[27:20] washed needeth not s to wash his feet
[27:23] but is clean every weight and you are
[27:26] clean but not
[27:41] for you know who for he knew who should
[27:44] betro him therefore said you are not all
[27:55] clean so after he had washed their feet
[27:59] and had taken his garments and was set
[28:01] down again he said unto them know ye
[28:04] what I have done to
[28:14] you you call me master and Lord and you
[28:17] say well for so I
[28:26] am if I your master Lord and Master have
[28:30] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[28:33] one another's
[28:43] feet for I have given you an example
[28:46] that you should do as I have done to
[28:56] you very I say to you the servant is not
[28:59] greater than his Lord neither he that is
[29:02] sent greater than he that sent
[29:13] him if you know the things happy are you
[29:16] if you do
[29:22] them his word you may seated
[29:28] so I want to preach on the
[29:32] subject in verse
[29:34] 15 it
[29:36] says I have given you an
[29:40] example praise the name of the Lord I
[29:43] have given you an
[29:45] example praise the name of our Lord and
[29:49] we know that our Lord Jesus
[29:51] Christ whatever he said in his
[29:55] word he demonstrated it
[29:59] he was showing whatever he was
[30:02] saying when he said love your
[30:05] enemy he demonstrated that he loved his
[30:09] enemy when he said be
[30:12] meek he demonstrated being me because
[30:16] whatever he was
[30:18] saying was part of him praise the name
[30:22] of our Lord and he said okay you call me
[30:25] master you call me Lord but I have
[30:28] humbled
[30:29] myself and then I have given you an
[30:33] example and then he tells us that we
[30:36] should also do the same to
[30:39] others praise the name of our Lord he
[30:42] gave us an example of a righteous life
[30:46] he gave us an example you know of
[30:49] sacrificing
[30:51] ourselves he gave us an example in
[30:54] everything and now the Lord has called
[30:57] us
[30:58] he also wants us to be
[31:02] examples that we can be examples to
[31:05] others when you at your home he wants
[31:08] you to be an example at your
[31:10] home when you at your place of work he
[31:13] wants you to be an example at your place
[31:15] of work and then we have a number of
[31:18] ministers God also wants you to be an
[31:22] example to your church praise the name
[31:25] of our Lord he has given us an
[31:28] example and you know as long as God has
[31:32] given you a
[31:34] responsibility as long as God has given
[31:36] you a
[31:38] role that means that there is something
[31:40] that you keep on
[31:43] doing now in whatever you're doing
[31:46] people are watching you people are
[31:48] depending upon you praise the name of
[31:51] our Lord like how do we handle the
[31:53] Affairs that have been given to
[31:56] us maybe if you par
[31:59] how what example are you giving to your
[32:01] children you stay in a certain
[32:04] Community what example are you giving to
[32:06] your
[32:07] neighbors so Christ says he has given us
[32:10] an
[32:11] example and it is also necessary for
[32:15] us to be good
[32:18] examples to the others praise the name
[32:21] of our Lord he wants us also to show
[32:23] good
[32:25] examples to others praise the name of
[32:28] our Lord now in the message the spoken
[32:31] word is the
[32:33] oral brother Bram say if you want a
[32:37] church start with the word of
[32:41] God you want life you want you want life
[32:45] of
[32:46] God start with the word of
[32:49] God accept the word of God in its
[32:54] fullness every measure of it
[32:58] and if that is the fullness of God in
[33:01] you then the rain that falling will
[33:04] produce exactly what's in the your
[33:11] garden praise the name of the Lord he
[33:13] says if you want life there is a source
[33:17] of Life praise the name of our Lord God
[33:20] has given us his wife and then from the
[33:23] word we receive
[33:25] life praise the name of our Lord he
[33:28] continues to
[33:29] say where is your latter R coming up
[33:34] at you see where that's going after a
[33:38] while going over them World gos that
[33:41] Elijah
[33:44] got they thought they got GS or the man
[33:47] them School of the prophets
[33:57] them denominations
[34:00] had gathered some World
[34:03] GS and they thought they were
[34:09] peace then the works will be manifested
[34:12] in
[34:14] him the
[34:16] works will be the works will be
[34:18] manifested in
[34:21] him are the
[34:23] same for it is the same seed word of God
[34:30] God
[34:32] son was his example
[34:38] seed so now Christ came as the Son of
[34:42] God and then we are also the children of
[34:46] God so we we have an example
[34:50] SE through our Lord Jesus Christ that
[34:54] you know we have what to look to
[34:58] we have where to get our influence
[35:01] from praise the name of our Lord you
[35:04] have something that
[35:06] influences so then you need to take the
[35:08] word of
[35:09] God and when you have the word of God
[35:13] then the word of God Be Your
[35:16] influence let the word of God be
[35:18] established in
[35:19] you now if you don't have the word of
[35:22] God then you'll draw influences from
[35:25] some other
[35:27] you get examples from wrong
[35:31] things and when you get examples from
[35:33] wrong
[35:34] things then you will pattern by
[35:38] that praise the name of our Lord you
[35:41] will pattern by that but now God wants
[35:44] us to have to take Christ as our
[35:49] example praise the name of our Lord the
[35:52] Bible talks about
[35:54] Jezebel and when Jezebel became the
[35:57] queen of
[36:00] Israel she took over the governance of
[36:02] the
[36:03] kingdom and then she
[36:06] was and then the Bible says Jezebel she
[36:11] produced
[36:13] daughters and now some of the daughters
[36:15] also became Queens to other
[36:19] Kingdom and now when they became
[36:23] Queens they also taught those places out
[36:26] to worship idols
[36:29] so now we see that
[36:31] Jezebel was a wrong
[36:34] example you know mothers as Pastor has
[36:38] been teaching us this morning you are an
[36:42] example you are un influenced your
[36:45] children un influenced your
[36:48] family then what kind of influence do
[36:50] you
[36:52] give praise the name of our Lord
[36:54] nowadays when you walk on the streets
[36:57] you get an elderly
[36:59] woman just dressing with short
[37:04] things tight things and he's moving with
[37:07] his
[37:08] daughter and then the daughters
[37:10] addressed the
[37:12] same praise the name of our so if the
[37:16] mother was maybe a
[37:20] prostitute then what would expect of the
[37:23] daughters jeel was worship
[37:27] she also produced Idol
[37:30] worshipers praise the name of our Lord
[37:33] until she brought the kingdom of Judah
[37:35] to destruct the king of Judah to be
[37:39] killed praise the name of our Lord when
[37:42] the daughter married the king of
[37:46] Judah and then the king of Judah was
[37:49] destroyed praise the name of so now God
[37:53] has given us a good
[37:55] example and he wants us to take that
[37:58] right
[37:59] example also become examples to
[38:03] others praise the name of our Lord now
[38:06] let us go to the book of First Timothy
[38:09] chter
[38:12] 4 praise the name of our Lord First
[38:15] Timothy
[38:17] 4 and then verse
[38:20] 9 the B
[38:22] says this is a faithful saying and worth
[38:25] of all acceptation
[38:32] for therefore we both labor and suffer
[38:36] reproach because we trust in the Living
[38:39] God who is the savior of all men
[38:42] especially those
[38:58] these things command and
[39:03] teach praise the name of our Lord then
[39:06] says let no man despise your
[39:11] youth but be though an example of the
[39:18] Believers in the word in
[39:21] conversation in charity in
[39:25] spirit in faith
[39:33] inity praise the name of the Lord so the
[39:36] Bible is saying we have received the
[39:40] word and when we have received the
[39:43] word we need to obey that
[39:47] word and that word will make us examples
[39:50] to
[39:52] others praise the name of the Lord as a
[39:56] believer are an example to the
[40:00] nonbelievers as a pastor are an example
[40:03] to your
[40:05] congregation as a husband I an example
[40:08] to your
[40:09] family as a mother I example to your
[40:14] children you know as a Christian an
[40:17] example to the community where are you
[40:20] living Jesus says he has given us an
[40:23] example and he also wants us to be
[40:26] examples
[40:29] something that has a good
[40:32] influence praise the name of the Lord
[40:35] where by the Bible is telling us you are
[40:37] an example in the word of
[40:40] God you are an example in the
[40:43] conversation in other words in your
[40:46] conduct your conduct is a good
[40:50] example you an example in
[40:53] charity you an example in the spirit of
[40:56] God
[40:58] an example in
[41:00] faith if somebody comes to you and then
[41:04] they have troubles will you discourage
[41:06] them
[41:08] Father ah that problem nobody can handle
[41:12] oh that thing now you can't manage or
[41:14] you increase their faith to trust in God
[41:19] you know the Bible tells us when we go
[41:22] to First Peter chapter
[41:24] 3 praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[41:27] says in verse
[41:29] one likewise ye
[41:31] wives be in subjection to your own
[41:37] husband that if obey not the
[41:41] word they also May without the word be
[41:45] wared by the conversation of the
[41:50] wives now the Bible is telling us as a
[41:53] Christian
[41:55] wife as a Christian Child
[41:58] your
[41:59] conduct can win people to
[42:03] Christ when you are a good example in
[42:06] your
[42:08] community praise the name of our Lord so
[42:10] you need to see that the life you
[42:14] live is according to the word of
[42:17] God praise the name of our Lord the
[42:20] problem we are
[42:22] living we are living in a time where we
[42:26] have a lot of wrong things than what is
[42:31] right we have a lot of fake things than
[42:34] what is
[42:36] correct we have a lot of
[42:39] Darkness than what light is there and
[42:42] now the problem is if you also go with
[42:46] the wrong
[42:47] side you will become a
[42:50] reproach you bring a r to
[42:53] Christ praise the name of our Lord so
[42:56] God want to be good
[42:59] examples
[43:01] examples praise the name of our Lord
[43:04] Christ has given us an example so he
[43:07] wants us to be
[43:09] examples to the people that we live
[43:12] in now in the message the oncoming
[43:15] storm he says there is only two
[43:19] things that is you are either a
[43:23] Believer or
[43:25] unbeliever praise the name of our Lord
[43:28] and you know the Bible says that by
[43:31] their fruits we shall know
[43:33] them not their
[43:36] confession but by their fruits not what
[43:40] they call
[43:41] themselves praise the name of our Lord
[43:44] but by their
[43:46] fruits so what fruit do you give because
[43:50] the tree is known by the
[43:53] fruit now if the tree does not produce
[43:56] fruit
[43:58] what is it
[44:01] identity praise the name of our
[44:08] Lord
[44:10] not you have lost your
[44:14] identity you are not show you're not
[44:17] giving the fruit of
[44:20] Christ so now your
[44:22] identity is the fruit so he says if you
[44:26] are a
[44:27] Believer you do not those
[44:31] things if you do them I don't know what
[44:35] kind of profession you
[44:37] have but if you do that the love of God
[44:42] isn't in
[44:46] you What's happen with the
[44:50] projector praise the name of the Lord he
[44:53] says if you don't do that
[44:57] the love of God isn't in
[44:59] you the Bible says we've got too much
[45:05] profession without a possession of
[45:13] it what what you are what you are not
[45:16] Christ didn't do
[45:20] that Jesus confessed what he
[45:24] was and Jesus want us confess what
[45:27] praise the name of our Lord if you some
[45:29] a message
[45:32] believer then you follow the word of
[45:35] God if you a message believer then you
[45:39] don't behave like the denomination
[45:41] of pra the name of if you a message
[45:45] believer then be like the
[45:48] message walk in the message dress like
[45:51] the message live like the message praise
[45:55] the name of We Are living in a terrible
[45:58] time that somebody speaks to
[46:01] you not to know the truth from
[46:04] you that's how to trap
[46:08] you that's the problem we have the way
[46:11] they were coming to Jesus
[46:13] Christ then they asked
[46:16] him this man
[46:18] Cesar you know is he giving us a lot of
[46:22] taxes is not doing
[46:25] good then they wanted to trap
[46:28] Jesus the concern was not about the
[46:32] taxes but the concern was what caus what
[46:35] blame they would get with Jesus
[46:37] Christ they bring the woman who was
[46:39] caught in
[46:40] adulter what do you
[46:43] say not for them to be
[46:46] delivered not for the woman to be
[46:49] forgiven but to get an accusation
[46:52] against and that's the mind of many
[46:55] people
[46:57] is the what they speak is not what they
[47:00] mean
[47:01] in but that's not
[47:03] Christ praise the name of our Lord
[47:05] that's not an example of
[47:08] Christ we need to see that our
[47:11] confession is the same as our life we
[47:15] live when I say yes let it be yes let my
[47:20] not not my to be
[47:22] no praise the name of the Lord then he
[47:26] says
[47:27] we've got too much profession without a
[47:32] position too
[47:34] many too many saying are not leaving
[47:40] it I think even we have two much
[47:43] practice on
[47:46] sermons and not leaving enough sermon
[47:57] you are preaching but you are what you
[47:58] are preaching
[48:01] is your life really contrary to what you
[48:04] are speaking and the Bible says
[48:10] brother those
[48:15] arees were
[48:20] drama they do th what they were
[48:23] not you cannot be an example when you
[48:26] like that praise the name of our
[48:30] Lord be a real
[48:32] Pastor praise the name of our follow
[48:36] what the word says about
[48:38] you if you a Believer be a genuine
[48:42] believer praise the name of our Lord
[48:45] then he says I think even we have too
[48:48] much practice on
[48:51] sermons are not leaving enough sermons
[48:56] would be a lot
[49:00] better if we lived our
[49:08] sermons each one of us would be a
[49:13] minister now what is he saying that if
[49:17] you a
[49:19] Believer and you are following the word
[49:21] of
[49:22] God the life that you live is
[49:25] ministering
[49:28] praise the name of the Lord the life
[49:30] that you are living is
[49:33] ministering when they want love you are
[49:36] written a piece of
[49:38] love not a
[49:41] theory praise the name of our not a
[49:44] theory but a life that is
[49:47] lived and that's what Christ has given
[49:49] unto
[49:50] us then he says it's better to leave me
[49:54] a seron
[49:57] then preach me
[50:01] one praise the name of he says leave
[50:11] me that you
[50:14] have not only speaking what you are not
[50:18] when Christ demonstrated it and he said
[50:22] what I have done to
[50:24] you do to others
[50:28] praise the name of the Lord so we need
[50:29] to challenge
[50:31] ourselves the life that I'm
[50:34] living what example am I giving
[50:37] out praise the name of the Lord how will
[50:40] people believe
[50:41] you how will they believe you when you
[50:43] live contrary to the
[50:46] message how will they believe you when
[50:47] you live contrary to the word of
[50:50] God praise the name of our Lord when you
[50:53] say this you don't mean it you are
[50:58] deceiving how would they take you
[51:01] serious praise the name of our Lord so
[51:03] he says leave me a
[51:06] someon instead of preaching to me
[51:09] one praise the name of our Lord the
[51:12] Bible say you are written
[51:16] Epistles of
[51:17] God read of all
[51:21] men praise the name of our Lord so it's
[51:25] best to live the
[51:32] have the
[51:33] life over the
[51:36] sermon praise the name of the Lord let
[51:39] somebody take you at your
[51:43] word when you say
[51:45] tomorrow let it be so when you say this

[51:59] through leave me
[52:01] Aon praise the name of our Lord leave me
[52:04] a sermon give me a good example that I
[52:09] can
[52:10] follow and this is what Paul is telling
[52:13] Timothy be an example to the
[52:16] Believers in your conduct in your words
[52:21] in whatever you do and this is what the
[52:23] Lord wants from
[52:24] us the Bible says
[52:27] praise the name of our Lord in MTH
[52:33] 5 MTH 5 verse
[52:37] 13 He says you are the salt of the
[52:42] earth but if the salt have lost his
[52:47] saver where with shall it be
[52:52] salted good for nothing
[52:56] but to be cast
[52:58] out to be troen under the foot of
[53:01] men now if you lose your sness as a
[53:07] Christian the life of Jesus Christ the
[53:10] Bible says you are worth to be stepped
[53:14] on because
[53:16] useless you are troen
[53:18] down praise the name of in other words
[53:21] you are not carrying the true
[53:24] name but you are taking a different
[53:27] name praise the name of our Lord so he
[53:30] says you are the light of the
[53:33] world a city that set on Hill cannot be
[53:38] he neither do men light a
[53:43] candle and put it under a
[53:47] bullsh but on a
[53:53] Candlestick that it gives its light unto
[53:56] to all that are in the
[53:59] house praise the name of the Lord so
[54:02] your
[54:03] light The Life of Christ should be
[54:06] manifested in
[54:08] us what example are we
[54:11] giving praise the name of the Lord what
[54:14] example are we
[54:16] giving you know when the children go to
[54:19] nurser
[54:21] schools the teachers demonstrate to them
[54:23] what they talking about
[54:26] when he says one he brings an orange he
[54:30] says this is one then when he brings
[54:33] another put them together they're
[54:37] demonstrating says
[54:39] two praise the name of our Lord you know
[54:42] there was radio there is a program on
[54:44] the
[54:47] radio used to play after radio programs
[54:49] every
[54:51] Tuesday and then it was called Lively
[54:54] mind
[54:56] and you know they would teach
[54:58] people people even have never gone to
[55:01] school how to teach their children to
[55:08] come how about us we need to teach
[55:11] people don't know
[55:14] Christ that this is how Christ
[55:17] lived praise the name of our Lord by
[55:20] giving them an
[55:22] example example of Good
[55:25] Conduct examp in
[55:27] prayer example in Waiting upon the
[55:30] Lord example in reading out the word of
[55:34] God praise the name of our Lord now if
[55:37] you can't expect
[55:39] them praise the name of our Lord to do
[55:42] what you failing to do
[55:44] Yourself Praise the name of our
[55:47] Lord and then we need to challenge
[55:50] ourselves praise the name of our Lord
[55:52] like many times you go to the churches
[55:55] in the missionary
[55:56] F and then you find a pastor doesn't
[55:59] even how to know to read his
[56:02] Bible then what does he
[56:06] preach praise the name of our Lord when
[56:09] they get to read the
[56:11] scripture the pronunciation is contrary
[56:14] to what it is
[56:21] saying praise the name of the Lord what
[56:24] is he preaching
[56:28] or he just goes and gets something some
[56:31] story and then he brings it to the
[56:43] people praise the name of the
[56:46] Lord and then there are those who have
[56:48] got church Edge
[56:50] books years
[56:53] ago before
[56:56] but they are either on chapter
[56:59] one on chapter
[57:03] two then what what are you
[57:06] ministering when the Bible has told us
[57:09] let us be an
[57:12] example in that scripture in first
[57:17] Timothy First
[57:19] Timothy chapter 4 verse
[57:22] 12 but be though an example of believer
[57:28] in
[57:29] word where do you get your word
[57:32] from when you don't read
[57:34] it praise the name of where do you get
[57:38] your
[57:39] inspiration if you don't
[57:41] read and you don't wait on the Lord and
[57:45] then don't listen when the Bible says in
[57:48] Revelations chapter 1
[57:51] verse3 blessed are they
[57:56] that
[57:58] read praise the name of our and here the
[58:02] word written in the book and do
[58:05] them now there are those who can read
[58:09] There are those who can hear but they
[58:12] don't do
[58:14] it that's not a good
[58:17] example praise the name of our Lord
[58:19] where we have read in John Chapter
[58:22] 13 in John 13 verse1 17
[58:27] praise the name of our Lord let us go
[58:29] back
[58:31] there the scripture
[58:33] says if you know these
[58:38] things so how will you know
[58:41] them you know the things by reading them
[58:46] by hearing
[58:48] them very good you have read it very
[58:52] good you've heard it but the Bible says
[58:56] happy are you if you do
[59:00] them praise the name of our Lord that's
[59:02] what God is calling us he calling us to
[59:05] a higher
[59:07] level praise the name of the Lord a
[59:09] higher level where we have known these
[59:12] things and if we have known these things
[59:15] he wants to see the life in
[59:18] us the life of Jesus CHR praise the name
[59:21] of our Lord we need to go
[59:24] beyond the beginnings
[59:27] praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[59:29] says we need to go to
[59:34] Perfection more excellent
[59:37] way if you have been
[59:40] hearing thank you for hearing but he
[59:42] also wants you to read praise the name
[59:45] of our Lord if you have been reading
[59:48] thank you for reading but he wants you
[59:49] to oby
[59:52] those to become a written EP let them
[59:55] become the life of Jesus
[59:58] himself and then you can be a good
[1:00:01] example to the
[1:00:04] others praise the name of the Lord you
[1:00:06] know brother
[1:00:08] Bram when he saw the church or the bride
[1:00:12] in
[1:00:14] preview when the bride of Christ was
[1:00:16] being
[1:00:19] presented praise the name of our Lord he
[1:00:22] didn't see their
[1:00:24] Bibles he didn't see the books of the
[1:00:28] message of the TS he saw
[1:00:31] individuals who had become the life of
[1:00:35] those and that's where our Redemption is
[1:00:39] that's where our deliverance is if we
[1:00:42] take these things and live the life of
[1:00:45] these
[1:00:46] things that's being a good
[1:00:49] example praise the name of our Lord it
[1:00:51] says if you know this things happy are
[1:00:54] you
[1:00:56] if you do them so he he wants us to
[1:01:01] manifest
[1:01:03] it praise the name of our Lord now in
[1:01:06] Mark chapter
[1:01:07] 13 and then verse
[1:01:11] 37 praise the name of our Lord Mark
[1:01:17] 13:37 he
[1:01:19] says and what I say unto
[1:01:24] you I say unto to
[1:01:28] all praise the name of our so each of us
[1:01:33] has been given a
[1:01:35] responsibility to take the word of God
[1:01:39] serious in our lives he says what I say
[1:01:43] unto you I say unto
[1:01:47] all praise the name of the Lord so we
[1:01:50] have no
[1:01:52] excuse he has given us an example
[1:01:56] an example of what we need to
[1:01:58] do praise the name of our Lord now in
[1:02:02] the message the choosing of a
[1:02:04] bride he says
[1:02:07] character there was never there never
[1:02:10] was a character like Jesus
[1:02:14] Christ it lives in
[1:02:18] you and manifest
[1:02:21] him we see it is true it's not world
[1:02:26] beauty of
[1:02:28] him that attracts his
[1:02:31] bride it is his
[1:02:34] character the character of the
[1:02:37] church that Jesus looks
[1:02:40] for not where it's big
[1:02:44] buildings where it's a great
[1:02:47] domination a big
[1:02:49] membership he promised to meet with whe
[1:02:52] whe whether they are two or three
[1:02:56] are gathered together that's where the
[1:02:59] True Believer rest his
[1:03:01] hope is upon that word of
[1:03:06] God being Vindicated in
[1:03:09] truth praise the name of our so he says
[1:03:11] there was never a character like Jesus
[1:03:15] Christ he gave us an
[1:03:18] example he gave us what we need to do he
[1:03:22] demonstrated to us what we need to
[1:03:24] do praise name of our Lord Jesus showed
[1:03:28] us how to live a holy life Jesus showed
[1:03:32] us how to overcome
[1:03:34] Temptation Jesus showed us how to
[1:03:37] forgive one
[1:03:38] another Jesus showed us how to pray how
[1:03:43] to be
[1:03:44] obedient because he was born a son so he
[1:03:48] had to be obedient to the word of God he
[1:03:52] offered
[1:03:53] himself he offered himself
[1:03:56] and that was an example he was giving to
[1:03:59] us and he says I have given you an
[1:04:02] example now the question comes back us
[1:04:06] what examples are we
[1:04:08] giving what example are we giving at our
[1:04:12] homes what examples are we giving to our
[1:04:17] churches what
[1:04:19] examples praise the name of the Lord and
[1:04:22] you find that if if you as a a family

[1:04:30] not
[1:04:32] serious praise the name of our Lord or
[1:04:35] as a pastor you not serious on this they
[1:04:39] will also not be
[1:04:40] serious praise the name of if you have
[1:04:43] not got Grace to do
[1:04:45] it then who will get the grace to do
[1:04:49] it it's not that you have not got the
[1:04:53] grace but you have rejected it
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:04:58] you're not being
[1:04:59] obedient praise the name of our Lord
[1:05:02] that's how we get the Grace by being
[1:05:05] obedient to the word of and then you see
[1:05:08] God gives you the
[1:05:10] ability to live the life of his
[1:05:13] word praise the name of our Lord by
[1:05:16] yielding to God and then you see God
[1:05:19] takes you from one step another one step
[1:05:21] to another and then you find yourself
[1:05:24] completely changed
[1:05:27] completely
[1:05:28] transform you know you surrender like
[1:05:31] Christ he said thy will oh
[1:05:35] God that's what I'm going to do and this
[1:05:38] is what the Lord wants also from us that
[1:05:41] we can seek the will of God we can
[1:05:45] depend upon the Lord that the Lord may
[1:05:48] change our lives Christ gave us an
[1:05:51] example and brother Bram has told us
[1:05:54] that Christ
[1:05:56] he was such a
[1:05:58] character and his
[1:06:00] attraction was not the
[1:06:02] beauty his
[1:06:04] attraction was his
[1:06:07] character what is our
[1:06:10] character what do people talk
[1:06:13] about praise the name of the Lord what
[1:06:16] do they talk about you how are you known
[1:06:19] where you
[1:06:20] live do you how are you known where you
[1:06:23] live
[1:06:29] praise the
[1:06:35] name someone
[1:06:37] who
[1:06:41] abusing or someone who is very
[1:06:46] careless those are the kind of names
[1:06:48] that you
[1:06:53] receive because the name show the very
[1:06:56] in
[1:07:13] you those are the examples that you give
[1:07:15] to
[1:07:17] people then how would they take the
[1:07:20] example of
[1:07:22] Christ if for you
[1:07:25] the example you give the sermon you
[1:07:29] leave is contrary to
[1:07:34] [Music]
[1:07:35] Christ praise the name of our
[1:07:37] Lord what is the example you are giving
[1:07:56] praise the name of the Lord he's coming
[1:07:59] for a church without spot or
[1:08:02] wrinkle praise the name of our Lord now
[1:08:05] what you need to do is just surrender
[1:08:09] yourself like David when the prophet
[1:08:12] told him you are the
[1:08:15] man David didn't start arguing you don't
[1:08:18] you know that I'm a King David said Lord
[1:08:22] have mercy upon
[1:08:23] me praise the name of
[1:08:26] David said Lord forgive
[1:08:29] me and then the prophet told God has
[1:08:32] forgiven he has taken away your sin and
[1:08:35] you're not going to die praise the name
[1:08:38] of our Lord and you see these things
[1:08:39] which are contrary to the word of
[1:08:42] God they make us dead in
[1:08:46] Christ you have no identity of
[1:08:50] Christ you have the identity of the
[1:08:54] enemy praise the name of it's just like
[1:08:58] a woman producing a child resembling the
[1:09:01] [Laughter]
[1:09:06] neighbor no identity of the father at
[1:09:10] home we shouldn't have be Children of
[1:09:13] the
[1:09:15] neighbor you behave like the
[1:09:19] neighbor you hate like the
[1:09:22] neighbor praise the name of our Lord but
[1:09:25] we need to Love Like Our
[1:09:28] Father praise the name of our Lord we
[1:09:31] need to forgive like
[1:09:33] Christ we need to forbear with one
[1:09:35] another like
[1:09:37] Christ not the
[1:09:40] neighbor praise the name of our Lord
[1:09:42] Pastor was preaching last
[1:09:44] Sunday how these trees are inter
[1:09:47] Tred and if lacked
[1:09:52] discernment instead of picking from the
[1:09:54] Tree of Life
[1:09:56] she picked from the Tree of knowledge of
[1:09:58] God and she manifested that
[1:10:02] character but God has given us the blood
[1:10:04] of Jesus
[1:10:06] Christ that we can have true
[1:10:09] discernment praise the name of our that
[1:10:11] we can have the Life of Christ
[1:10:14] himself that is manifested in
[1:10:18] us the name of and having the life of
[1:10:21] Jesus Christ is not something difficult
[1:10:25] it's not
[1:10:27] complicated Just Surrender
[1:10:29] yourself give your life to
[1:10:32] God let him take over and say Lord here
[1:10:36] I
[1:10:37] am help me and then you continue
[1:10:41] following and then you'll see the life
[1:10:43] change it's not
[1:10:46] difficult praise the name of our Lord
[1:10:49] allow the word to settle in your heart
[1:10:52] and then the word itself
[1:10:55] produce
[1:10:56] itself in your life praise the name of
[1:10:59] our lord it's not difficult praise the
[1:11:02] name of our Lord so Jesus gave us a
[1:11:05] character now in the message raising
[1:11:08] Jar's
[1:11:10] daughter he says oh how
[1:11:14] wonderful then this Maniac run down to
[1:11:19] him and the Lord Jesus rebuked them
[1:11:22] spirits
[1:11:25] and a lot of people said that religion
[1:11:27] will run you
[1:11:30] crazy not the religion of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:34] Christ it won't it will give you right
[1:11:40] mind praise the name of our Lord that's
[1:11:43] what Jesus does when he comes in your
[1:11:46] life he will give you a right
[1:11:49] mind right
[1:11:51] thinking right speech right conduct
[1:11:56] praise the name of our Lord it will give
[1:11:58] you right
[1:12:00] mind and you are not in your right
[1:12:04] mind until you have met the Lord
[1:12:08] Jesus and that should be our
[1:12:11] desire praise the name of our Lord is to
[1:12:14] meet the Lord Jesus Christ and when you
[1:12:16] meet the Lord Jesus Christ don't leave
[1:12:19] him there like the Rich Young
[1:12:22] Ruler praise the name of our Lord Rich
[1:12:26] met
[1:12:27] Christ he R he knelt down when Jesus
[1:12:32] told if you are going to do
[1:12:34] better what you need to
[1:12:36] do sell all that you have and then come
[1:12:40] and follow and that is the same basis we
[1:12:43] all meet
[1:12:46] Christ praise the name of our Lord
[1:12:50] even
[1:12:53] Abraham that was the same
[1:12:56] basis God told Abraham leave your
[1:13:00] country leave your
[1:13:03] inheritance Jesus was telling this man
[1:13:06] leaving your Earthly
[1:13:07] inheritance that will give you a better
[1:13:10] inheritance God told Abraham leave your
[1:13:14] land come and I show you another
[1:13:17] one praise the name of and Abraham
[1:13:22] obeyed but the rich man he said no no no
[1:13:27] no he
[1:13:30] refused so you can't be a good
[1:13:33] example if you have rejected
[1:13:36] him praise the name of our Lord you need
[1:13:39] to take him to accept him in your heart
[1:13:43] let him come and settle in your heart
[1:13:45] let him come be your
[1:13:48] savior not only your savior but even
[1:13:51] your
[1:13:52] lord he rules over your mind he rules
[1:13:57] over your words he rules over your
[1:14:00] actions praise the name of our Lord
[1:14:03] that's what the Lord
[1:14:04] wants and so when you have met him and
[1:14:07] is within you he will change
[1:14:10] you praise the name of our Lord he will
[1:14:13] change you in John chter
[1:14:16] 14 and then in verse
[1:14:19] 21 he says he that has my Commandments
[1:14:25] keeps
[1:14:26] them it is he that loveth
[1:14:29] me and he that loveth me shall beloved
[1:14:33] of my father and I will love him and I
[1:14:37] will manifest myself to
[1:14:40] him so the Bible says if you have his
[1:14:45] Commandments and you keep them so you
[1:14:48] may have
[1:14:50] them but you don't keep
[1:14:54] them praise the name of our now
[1:14:58] keeping how do you keep like if you have
[1:15:02] money and then you put here your
[1:15:06] money and then you go to
[1:15:08] town do you know how to keep
[1:15:11] money you have the money but you don't
[1:15:14] know how to keep it why there are people
[1:15:17] who are interested in
[1:15:23] it and the Bible say
[1:15:25] the seed that fell on the West
[1:15:30] Side praise the name of our Lord the
[1:15:32] seed that fell on the west
[1:15:35] side and the west side was a a condition
[1:15:38] of the
[1:15:41] heart the Bible says the birs came and
[1:15:44] stole
[1:15:46] it and the
[1:15:48] birs are
[1:15:51] demons Satan steals the word of God
[1:15:56] so if your heart is the wor
[1:16:00] side you you're not keeping the
[1:16:03] word praise the name of our Lord but
[1:16:06] then your heart needs to be a good
[1:16:10] ground when your heart is a good
[1:16:13] ground then you going to keep the
[1:16:16] word praise the name of the Lord let us
[1:16:19] read in in Luke chapter
[1:16:23] 8 Luke chapter
[1:16:26] 8 and then the Bible says in in verse
[1:16:32] 15 but that on the good
[1:16:37] Ground Luke 8:1
[1:16:41] 15 are they which in an honest and good
[1:16:48] heart praise the name of our Lord honest
[1:16:52] and a good heart
[1:16:56] now a honest
[1:16:59] heart is a repentant
[1:17:04] heart praise the name of our Lord
[1:17:06] because that's
[1:17:08] honest a honest
[1:17:11] heart is a repentant heart if I done
[1:17:16] mistake Lord have Mery upon like David
[1:17:21] he had a honest
[1:17:23] heart when you read in
[1:17:25] 51 he said Lord when you speak you are
[1:17:32] Justified he didn't start
[1:17:35] arguing he said I acknowledge my
[1:17:39] fault that was a honest
[1:17:42] heart so even you in your condition if
[1:17:45] you do something wrong God wants you to
[1:17:48] be honest and say Lord have mercy upon
[1:17:53] Lord have done something wrong so that's
[1:17:55] why the Bible saying that a good ground
[1:17:59] is a honest heart so even a good ground
[1:18:03] you can
[1:18:05] falter you can do
[1:18:08] mistakes but when you do those things he
[1:18:12] wants you to be
[1:18:13] honest Lord have mercy upon you he wants
[1:18:17] you to be
[1:18:18] repentant good
[1:18:20] ground then he
[1:18:22] says is a Hest and good
[1:18:26] heart and having heard the
[1:18:30] word what do they do they keep
[1:18:35] it the West Side
[1:18:38] heart when they heard the
[1:18:41] word they never kept it the birs of
[1:18:44] unbelief
[1:18:46] came Demons of unbelief came and took it
[1:18:50] but then the Bible says having heard the
[1:18:53] word they keep it how do you keep the
[1:18:57] word by believing the
[1:18:59] word how do you keep the word by
[1:19:02] meditating upon the word how do you keep
[1:19:06] the word by testifying
[1:19:09] about how do you keep the word by
[1:19:12] obeying the word you are keeping it you
[1:19:16] are obeying it that's keeping the word
[1:19:20] you are thinking about the word that is
[1:19:23] keeping it you are you are walking
[1:19:25] according to the
[1:19:27] word that's keeping it so he says after
[1:19:31] they have heard the word they keep the
[1:19:34] word they don't lose
[1:19:37] it and they bring forth fruit with
[1:19:42] patience so the Bible has told us he
[1:19:45] that has my
[1:19:46] Commandments and he keepeth them it is
[1:19:50] he that
[1:19:51] loveth and he that loveth me shall be
[1:19:54] loved of my
[1:19:56] father and I will come and manifest
[1:19:59] ourself to
[1:20:01] him so he manifest himself to us through
[1:20:05] revealing
[1:20:08] himself by answering our
[1:20:11] prayers he's manifesting
[1:20:13] himself by encouraging us he's
[1:20:16] manifesting himself to us praise the
[1:20:19] name of our Lord in John
[1:20:22] 14:23 he says Jesus answered and said
[1:20:26] unto
[1:20:26] him if a man love
[1:20:29] me he will keep my
[1:20:33] words and my father will love
[1:20:36] him and we will come unto him and make
[1:20:41] our B with
[1:20:43] him baptism of the Holy Spirit he says
[1:20:47] if you keep my if you love me you will
[1:20:49] keep my
[1:20:51] word so where do you keep your the word
[1:20:54] of God
[1:20:55] David said I've kept Thy word in my
[1:20:59] heart that I may not sin against
[1:21:03] you praise the name of our Lord you keep
[1:21:06] it in your heart you believe it you obey
[1:21:09] it you follow it and then he says if you
[1:21:14] do that we will love him and we will
[1:21:19] come and make our AB in that
[1:21:23] person so the Spirit comes
[1:21:26] down where the word of God
[1:21:28] is praise the name of our Lord and the
[1:21:31] Holy Spirit will give you the
[1:21:34] ability to be
[1:21:37] example say that the life that you
[1:21:40] live is no longer your
[1:21:42] life praise the name of our Lord so you
[1:21:45] lose the identity of the
[1:21:49] neighbor praise the name of our Lord and
[1:21:51] you have the identity of God himself
[1:21:56] like in
[1:21:57] Antioch they lost the identity of the
[1:22:00] neighbor and the Bible say they were
[1:22:03] called
[1:22:04] Christians because they saw them live
[1:22:07] like
[1:22:08] Christ praise the name of our they were
[1:22:11] living the life of
[1:22:13] Christ in Acts 11 and verse
[1:22:18] 26 and when he had found him he brought
[1:22:22] him unto Antioch
[1:22:25] and it came to pass that aier they
[1:22:29] assembled themselves with the
[1:22:32] church and taught much
[1:22:35] people and the disciples were called
[1:22:38] Christians first in
[1:22:41] Antioch why do they call
[1:22:44] you at your place of work why do they
[1:22:47] call you in your
[1:22:50] village what they call
[1:22:52] you we need to show the identity of
[1:22:55] Jesus
[1:22:57] Christ he has given us an
[1:22:59] example praise the name of our Lord he
[1:23:02] has given us an
[1:23:04] example that we should follow the
[1:23:07] same praise the name of our Lord now in
[1:23:10] the message raising J's
[1:23:14] daughter he says why some people call
[1:23:18] themselves
[1:23:21] gentlemen but so beastly till they would
[1:23:24] throw a baby out of the mother's
[1:23:33] arm maybe weigh about 250 PBS of
[1:23:44] muscles like some kind of an
[1:23:48] animal that ain't a
[1:23:53] man that is a a
[1:23:57] beast man is not measured by his
[1:24:02] muscles or his
[1:24:05] sture a man is measured by his
[1:24:11] character whatever he
[1:24:13] is it is his
[1:24:19] character praise the name of the Lord
[1:24:22] what do people know about you
[1:24:26] praise the name of our
[1:24:28] Lord and you know there are some people
[1:24:30] are good to come in the
[1:24:33] public they are
[1:24:36] good but the wife will tell you what
[1:24:38] kind of
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:47] husband people believe you outside
[1:24:54] how would they believe you oh my wife
[1:24:59] oh what is your
[1:25:03] character how do people what are you
[1:25:05] known
[1:25:08] by praise the name of but as children of
[1:25:12] God we have Christ as our
[1:25:15] example and we need to take the example
[1:25:17] of
[1:25:19] Jesus so he says man is not known by
[1:25:21] muscles
[1:25:25] oh how he
[1:25:27] appears but the character of Jesus
[1:25:46] Christ there was no beauty that as I
[1:25:49] said we should desire Jesus
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:54] but was a
[1:26:00] character the Bible say even when we
[1:26:03] looked upon
[1:26:04] him there was no Beauty we should desire
[1:26:07] of
[1:26:08] him we would all turn our heads from
[1:26:12] him and everything but a
[1:26:17] character has never been measured to
[1:26:22] him and that's the example the Lord
[1:26:25] Jesus
[1:26:26] Christ and he wants us also to be
[1:26:29] examples at our homes in our
[1:26:33] churches among the people we live in our
[1:26:37] communi Christ wants his life reflected
[1:26:40] in
[1:26:42] Us Praise the name of our Lord just the
[1:26:45] Life of Christ to be
[1:26:48] reflected praise the name of our Lord
[1:26:50] and this is something that the Lord is
[1:26:52] looking forward to
[1:26:54] praise the name of our let us go to
[1:26:56] First Peter chapter as I try to
[1:27:02] finish 1 Peter verse
[1:27:07] 21 he says for even here un we are
[1:27:12] called because Christ also suffered for
[1:27:15] us giving us an example that we should
[1:27:19] follow his steps
[1:27:32] who did not sin neither was G found in
[1:27:35] his
[1:27:40] mouth who when he was reviled reviled
[1:27:43] not again when he suffered he threatened
[1:27:45] not but committed himself to him that
[1:27:49] judges righteously
[1:27:59] who his own self bear our sins in his
[1:28:02] own body on the tree that we being dead
[1:28:05] to sins should live unto righteousness
[1:28:08] by whose Stripes you were healed
[1:28:28] praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[1:28:30] says Christ gave us an
[1:28:34] example so we have what to
[1:28:37] follow and now if you have accepted the
[1:28:39] Lord Jesus as your
[1:28:41] personal then take that whole example of
[1:28:45] Christ let the word of God dwell in you
[1:28:48] richly being obedient to that word
[1:28:51] following that word
[1:28:54] the word says and then you allow God
[1:28:57] himself to come down in your life and he
[1:29:01] lives his own life praise the name of
[1:29:04] our Lord because the Bible say the fruit
[1:29:07] of the
[1:29:08] spirit but where does the spirit bear
[1:29:10] his
[1:29:12] fruit he doesn't bear his fruit in the
[1:29:16] air but he wants to come in you and then
[1:29:20] he will bear his own fruit in you
[1:29:24] praise the name of our Lord and whatever
[1:29:26] the Lord Jesus told
[1:29:28] us it's only him who can do
[1:29:31] it if we obey him he comes down and does
[1:29:35] his own work he comes down and does his
[1:29:38] own
[1:29:39] work when he said the works that I do
[1:29:42] shall you do
[1:29:43] also it seem in
[1:29:46] you to do the same
[1:29:48] works the life that I live you shall
[1:29:52] live it is in him who comes in you to
[1:29:56] live his own life we only need to
[1:29:59] yield and say Lord Here I Am Lord fill
[1:30:03] me with your Holy Spirit Lord fill me
[1:30:05] with your presence Lord direct me and
[1:30:09] then the Lord will take over your life
[1:30:12] and then you'll be able to live the life
[1:30:14] of Jesus
[1:30:15] chist no longer I that live it but the
[1:30:19] Lord Jesus that Liv we need to yield
[1:30:22] ourselves and say Lord here I am praise
[1:30:26] the name of our Daniel after he had
[1:30:29] shown you had been shown a
[1:30:32] vision he was too weak and was on the
[1:30:35] ground and then the angel was trying to
[1:30:38] speak to
[1:30:39] him then Daniel confessed oh my Lord I'm
[1:30:44] too weak there's no more strength in me
[1:30:48] I can't even hear you can imagine how
[1:30:51] weak you were
[1:30:54] that you can't even
[1:30:55] hear so you need energy to
[1:30:58] hear praise the name of it was too
[1:31:02] weak but he knew that there's something
[1:31:04] being

[1:31:19] him be
[1:31:22] strong praise the name of our Lord be
[1:31:25] strong praise the name of our Lord and
[1:31:28] the Bible say let the weak
[1:31:31] say I am strong not of my own ability
[1:31:35] but the ability that the Lord Jesus
[1:31:37] gives
[1:31:38] us and that's how we live the life of
[1:31:41] Jesus CH Christ say Lord I desire more
[1:31:43] of you Lord I need more of you to take

[1:32:29] and your own
[1:32:31] family they will give a testimony praise
[1:32:34] the name of our Lord like that song
[1:32:36] which says I am not the man I used to

[1:32:52] changed praise the name of Lord giving a
[1:32:55] right
[1:32:57] example praise the name of our Lord God
[1:33:00] wants us to be
[1:33:01] examples as Christ has given us an
[1:33:04] example then in the Book of James
[1:33:07] chapter
[1:33:09] 5 and then verse
[1:33:12] S praise the name of our Lord it
[1:33:15] says be patient therefore Brethren unto
[1:33:18] the coming of the Lord behold the
[1:33:21] husband man waiteth for the ious fruit
[1:33:24] of the earth and has long patience for
[1:33:26] it until he receive the early and the
[1:33:29] lat
[1:33:46] rain also patient establish your hearts
[1:33:49] for the coming of the Lord draws nigh
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:34:01] not one against another Brethren Les you
[1:34:05] be condemned behold the judge stands
[1:34:08] before the
[1:34:18] door take my brethren the prophets who
[1:34:21] have spoken in the name of the Lord for
[1:34:24] an example of suffering Affliction and
[1:34:26] of
[1:34:40] patience behold we count them happy
[1:34:43] which endure you've heard of the
[1:34:45] patience of Job and have seen the end of
[1:34:47] the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful
[1:34:50] and of tender Mercy
[1:35:10] so the Bible says we have
[1:35:12] examples there are many examples we can
[1:35:15] look to in whatever station that we are
[1:35:18] going in whatever weakness that we have
[1:35:21] in whatever challenge that we have let

[1:35:31] you know the prophets what they went
[1:35:34] through take them as an example praise
[1:35:37] the name of our Lord and then the Bible
[1:35:38] says we have a great cloud of
[1:35:42] witnesses there's nothing we are going
[1:35:44] through that others have not gone
[1:35:46] through so we are a good
[1:35:49] example and God wants us to take those
[1:35:52] examples and then live his
[1:35:55] life praise the name of our Lord he has
[1:35:58] given us an example then what examples
[1:36:01] are
