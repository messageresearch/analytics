TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ration chter [Music] 17 amen there is a thought which is picked to come to that and now that point is in Revelation 13 Verse 18 you just leave your finger there because we shall be going back to 17 he says here is wisdom let him that has understand count the number of the Beast for the number of a man amen and this number 666 so when we are talking about a beast carrying a woman amen don't look at an animal look at a man who has set up assist are you together with me so in verse 4 of Revelation 17 he says and the woman was in purple and scet color and decked with [Music] gold and precious stones and PS having a golden cup in her hand full of abomination and fness of and this woman here is supposed to have been the church so we can call this woman a fallen woman a fallen church are you together with me and it has got somebody that rides around and upon her [Music] forehead was written a name mystery Bon the great the mother of and Abominations of the earth amen are you together with me he says that mystery babyon the great mother praise God so she is not Babylon but she is a mystery Babylon so in this this woman the Bible says she Seth upon many Waters so these are symbols Revelations the book of symbols in verse 15 We Now understand what the waters are verse 15 says and he says unto me the waters which thou seest amen where the SE are peoples and multitudes and Nations and tongs okay now so now they are describing this woman here and the Beast that carries her and then once he comes into chapter 18 ver one that's why he says after these things amen I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighted in his glory and he cried mightly with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every F Spirit and the C of every unclean and hatful so where are we called out of we are called out of a church system that has fallen from the world so this Babylon is a web that is knit around our social lives and all Natures of evil operates in this mystery Babylon under the power of Po Rel and money so of glob amen is knitted around these factors we got business cels business cels amen we get different drug CS amen and they all operate under there but our major emphasis today is not on money and politics it's now you and me not to be caught into that system that's what we are called out of because it says for all nations have drank of the wine of Ara amen and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with amen and the Marchers of the Earth are now greatly reached in the abundance of her delices and therefore I heard another voice from Heaven say come out of her my people amen in the world but not of the world Amen Rising above that's why he says come out of all my people this is not going to be another Exodus amen like it was in Egypt your call to come out is just for you not to be partaker of all the wrong things that happen in Babylon Amen in the Bible we've got an example of the children of Israel that were captured and taken into Babylon in captivity but then we've got three boys and another one and sadrach praise the Lord they were in Babylon but they refused to worship the god of babyon are you together with me in Babylon But Rising above Babylon we've got Daniel he was in Babylon a Fallen Kingdom which was wicked but Daniel rised above babon and you also you live in a mystery babyon a fallen wild system but one thing which we pray for that you may stand like Daniel in this babyon amen praise God listen to what the prophet say he says come out over my people say to the Lord come out of Babylon confusion come out of your of your Creeds of your self styled things I will receive you says the Lord touch not the unclean things nether bnic parties in church and the B and all other kind of stuff and he dances he says come out so where are we coming from you are not coming from a natural world another natural world like they came from Egypt into Canan that's not your call your call is to come out of the things that are generated in Babylon that those things don't have control over you the fashion of this world will not appeal to you you find people some of them are going for a wedding and they go naked my little grandchild two years looked at a picture of one of the people that were a bright this morning and she said naked girl those are things that are generated in the Fallen system and the purpose of all is to gender amen praise the Lord you know verse five of Revelation 18 says and upon her forehead was the name written mystery babyon the mother of hot and Abominations of the earth praise the Lord now this woman here that was riding on top of this Beast amen is called mystery babyon and the pest was the engineer behind her systems are you together with me you are going to understand today amen and understand where you come from what the gospel is calling you out to amen so the fth of her fornication means the fness of her unfaithfulness because she's supposed to a church that is married to the Lord Jesus Christ but that's not where her loyalty is you begin to show them scripture and prove to them that b in Jesus name and they refuse it you show them scripture that ladies should dress modestly they reject it are you together with me yeah it is a system that has got a hold of the people and when God is saving you that's the system he calls you out to take you to Messianic Kingdom where the word is our controller amen so you know unfaithful to Divine leadership unfaithful to the instructions of Christ which is supposed to be the husband to the church so and Abomination therefore because she was Mother of harot Amen the groups that reject the word and they come from that Union every group is called amen are you together with me and then he says again appear that full of Abominations of the earth so when you are called out of babyon the main you are being called out of is the Abominations uhuh amen you come out of the Abomination if you come out of a religion and you Ser come into the message and then you walking with the Abominations of the land you are still in Babylon while you here so to come out of babon is to totally come out of the uh you know traditions and uh the Abominations so Abomination means the things that are [Music] detestable something F amen and it's only God who can tell us what an Abomination is are you together with me it's not you who declares what an Abomination is it's God who tells us what an Abomination is because he the one who knows what is calling us out as we come into the Messianic King amen so let us look at a few of these Abominations in Leviticus chapter 18 and verse 22 I want you to write it down homosexuality is an Abomination okay because in Romans chapter 1 when the First Church of Rome fell the Bible says God gave them up to an unlean spirit and they started living together woman and wom and then men and men the Bible cause that an Abomination we come out of that we cannot be partaker of that kind of character amen Deuteronomy 7 verse 25 a worship involving idols is an Abomination are you together with me we cannot involve ourselves in a worship where they Idols some of these Idols are real uh you know sculptures but then there are some Idols where the men became the idol they desire to take the respect of God that's I mean idol worship it's Idol because no man can share this honor with the Lord Jesus Christ ameny verse 11 and 12 involving in Witchcraft and Consulting witches is an Abomination come out of that you are not supposed to be a partaker to astrology of any kind amen chapter 22 and verse five a woman wearing what pertains to a man is an Abomination Hallelujah mother of and all Abominations of the earth so we need to know the Abominations out of which we are called amen I know one day when I put on a dress and I start moving on the streets of Ginger either they will say I'm mad or the police will arrest me [Music] because it's not natural the Bible calls it an Abomination so when you talk to these ladies who were interested on putting on a man's cloth they said the fry of a man looks to the right but the one of a woman turns to the left but still the trous in our culture is accepted as a man's way but the people have taken for it the Bible says it's an Abomination amen so let's go to Proverbs chapter 15 and verse 8 the scripture says the sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord but the prayer of the ight is Delight are you together with me so now this is an Abomination where many of us could be found guilty we come to the church like this one we enjoy the teaching of the word but then we carry certain forms of life that qualify Us in wickedness the Bible say the sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord amen an offering paid in is an Abomination you bring your offering you bring your ti amen and you think God is pleased with you he is that's an abomination
