the pastor I have a longing in my heart for let's all stand and receive the pastor just to be near him oh to feel his presence I have a longing in my heart for you with our hands lifted up longing for Jesus Oh longing longing oh Jesus I have a longing in my heart for him just to be near to feel his presence to feel his praise I have a longing I have a longing in my heart oh yes I'm longing longing long I'm longing for Jesus longing for Jes I have a longing I have a longing in my heart for a longing for him to speak to me this morning just to be near him oh to feel his prise presence yes I have a loing in my heart for [Music] you [Music] that we may come into your presence by the blood of Jesus so this morning Father I want to Just Surrender myself that you may graciously use my body my voice is Lord and speak to the people using a natural language to speak spiritual things is not very easy but father I humble myself that you may speak to your sheep take your word feed your people give them the victory they need in Jesus name [Music] amen so I welcome you to the service this morning amen let's just turn to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 amen my wife is not here yeah we got some bit of flu and her condition is not good but the Lord is gracious as I've always said pastors never get sick they always at their post of Duty amen let's turn to Ephesians chapter one verse according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame in may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated so when we Mak a decision for Christ when one makes a decision for Christ there are certain areas of scripture that should be deeply pondered on so the scriptures help us to discover the potentials that goded in our favor to overcome amen we come to discover that a true decision will always overcome the weakness of the flesh amen so when God created Adam he knew that Adam would fall but then he predetermined that the devil would never hold him permanently God knew very well what Satan was going to do but then he made a decision that Satan would not have Adam permanently by the Fall the fall amen God proved his more than able to pick up his children that are trapped in sin so your weakness today does not Mark the end of your journey you know because you know God himself could not let Adam permanently in the hands of EV so in the process of extending grace to you God has laid certain resue plans he knew that when he picks you up that he would Jus you that would sanctify you and also baptize with the Holy Ghost that's how God does rest to us he so much cares about you that when you stray he already put some rescue plan for you again that he will leave the 99 and look for a repentant sin amen so one thing you need to assertain is that your repentance was genuine to the best of your understanding that's that's the only thing you needed to do that you are in church you are in the word because you feel that you are the genuine repentance amen because he says of those which you gave me I'll lose none if your repentance was genuine God can never lose you amen you can only come to genuine repentance because you are a part of are you here together with me that's the only way you can have a perfect repentance something from the bottom of your heart because he knew you from before the foundation of the world he knows you and because he knew you he had a great plan like Jeremiah 2911 says [Music] 2911 he says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you says the Lord thoughts of peace are not evil to give you unexpected end expects you to end in a certain way so God has never really thought evil about those who before knew because he is faithful to himself that's why he swears by himself he swears by himself praise the Lord you see in Hebrews 6 verse2 before we get into this I mean the scripture are going to deal with he says here that he be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises he says be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inhal the promises he's talking about the cloud of witnesses which is in Hebrews [Music] 11 by faith Abraham by faith sah by faith Enoch by faith Moses he says those through faith and patience they inherit the promises so faith and patience go [Music] together in the believer's Walk In Christ knowing this that the trying of your faith work amen verse3 for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he SW by himself Hallelujah do you understand that I'm telling you that God is faithful to himself amen because in swearing you look for somebody greater you get somebody who is greater and you swear by in writing an O amen you go before a lawyer or a judge or a magistrate but God looked at all of them and he was greater than them all and so he SW by himself amen saying blessing I bless thee and multiplying i m and so after he had patiently ended he obtained the promise to Men veryy by the greater and an for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife so an O dissolves all [Music] disputations amen was SW before one who is greater but God could not find any greater than himself any who has more faithful so verse 17 where in God willing more abundant to show unto the ha of Promise the immutability of his castle confirmed by no amen so God was willing to show that he has a promise the immutability of his C so he says I'm going to make a oath and I'm going to Ser it by myself I want you to get that image before we sink into Ephesians go SW all that you are going to be there and it doesn't fail amen he says here this thing says the amen I like that it means that whatever he said is final it means that whatever he say to the first age and to the second age and to all ages about his own true church and about the false vibe is exactly right and it won't change it means that what he started out within Genesis he will finish in Revelation he has to for is the amen so let it be he comes to the next paragraph This things says the faithful and true witness now I want to show you what I find in thought of faithful you know we often talk about a great and changing God whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of of him that makes him seem very [Music] impersonal it is as though God made the world universe and the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and became a personal God amen because he has written everything he has said everything in order like he just locked himself in the back and he doesn't care that's how people think about God it's as though God made a way of salvation for lost mankind that we being the cross and then we when the death of Christ has atoned for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him God folded his arms and stood back that's what people think so it's up to you you walk in it or you were lost that's what people think but brother Bram is saying God is Not imp personal amen it's as if we imagine believing in a great Creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation Now I said that is how too many people are able to think but that's ra thinking amen for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now he both Creator and sustainer Hallelujah hu he's a person of God he cares about how you woke up this morning he cares when you don't have something to eat he cares when you have got a loan to pay he cares when you have family troubles he's a personal God he cares what you eat are you together with me yeah we don't serve any personal God he's your personal God he cares for you and every El after the finishing life he's not going to give you up he cares when you're driving your car he cares when you are crossing the road we serve a personal God he cares when you go to bed he cares when you wake up we serve God who cares for his children amen so Colossians chapter one and verse 16 he says for by him were all things [Music] created that in heaven and that in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities all powers all things were created by Him and for him for are you together with me if you are a son of God God created you but if you are not a child of God you are a biological product just a of your father and mother and then you are given a human Spirit to lead your flesh but if you are a child of God you came from the mind of God and if you come from the mind of God all things were created by Him and for him he's a person of God and is before all things and by him all things consist and is before all things and by him all things consist if you are a child of God from the bottom of your heart you are because he is he says here back in church book he is a sovereign God by his own castle he purposed The Plan of Salvation of his own elect for which he he for knew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of Salvation and the Holy Spirit executes the will of the father he working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he's right in the midst of it all he's in the midst of his church this great Creator savior God is Faithfully working among his own right now as the great Shepherd of the sheep his very existence is for his own he loves them and cares for them His Eye Is Never upon them he's talking to you he cares for you when the word says that your lives are HID with Christ and God it means exactly what it says so today your life is hidden in Christ in God those are powerful statements amen hallelujah hallelujah yes sir I am so so glad that my God abides faithful he true to himself he true to himself he want lie he's true to the word he will back it up he true to us he will lose none of us us up in the last day I am glad I am resting in his faithfulness are you resting in his faithfulness so there are many scriptures to ponder about the love of God for us that eternal love he didn't love me yesterday and hatte me today he made a plan and by that plan every one of us will overcome everyone everyone who made a faithful confession that Lord forgive my sin he'll overcome he lose none Philippians 1:6 says being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it to the day of the Lord Jesus Christ many scriptures to P about on the love of God he has for you but the devil wakes up in the morning to tell you you won't overcome you won't make it he's negative and he always puts that poison in your mind but God has spoken to you this morning that he rules he rules in the Affairs of men amen so I want to speak on the subject Dev his [Music] mind now Ephesians 1:4 according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world he did choose you when you came to the altar you came to the altar because he knew you from before the foundation of the world and now that you should be holy and Without Blame before him in love he chose you before the foundation so that you can be holy and Without Blame chosen in him by election to be holy Without Blame then the devil will tell you look at what you are can that apply to you and then he will tell you you are not the one but if you made a genuine repentance he has made a way to bring you to what he thought about you he knew you as holy and Without Blame and we are growing into that amen so there is a way God knew us that we have never broken into yet therefore the bride is the developing Revelation amen you are a deving revelation because you've been a mystery and the world knew you as evil Wicked filthy undesirable but day after day you are growing from glory to glory there was the glory of justification God Justified you are coming through the glory of sanctification on every daily basis when you sit before the word you go out more glorified that when you came in is that amen so God is working you upward amen and this growth is a mystery that like Christ said about the seed in the ground you put the seed in the ground you go sleep and wake up you can never know that the seed has grown but all of a sudden you see it brings up a blade amen and then you see it brings up the you know the ear and then the food in the a so the seed keeps growing but then you cannot know how that's how also we are growing we are the seed of God planted in the good ground of our hearts so our way of grow is what I'm calling a developing Revelation amen which I'm calling a a developing Revelation and this growth is divinely managed by God himself as we submit to the word so God knew us at a level that is still a mystery to us meaning that we shall come to a time when we shall know as we were known of God Amen God himself knows what is working he knows and day after day you this you overcome that you are going to see people fall away why do they fall away because they cannot stand to the end and bring forth that development you understand what I mean it's just the grace of God that we come to what we are if you are able to be a believer today and you are positive and you wake up the following day and you are a Believer and postive keep thanking God because the devil is not sleeping he's working day in and day out he keeps Judas in the mid of the church and you see Judas never leaves the S went but Judah never leaves until the last minute so I want to tell you that you must know who you are you are a seed growing in the midst of the tears but then your growth is going to be a constant mystery therefore it's necessary for us to remain in fellowship with the word because through the word we come to pick our self realization amen every one of you must come to a self realization amen of who you are where you come from and where you are headed because in the vine Year God deals with single seat to make the entire farm so you must tell you come to a self realization of what type of seed you are amen he says here and now to these sons of God who by him overcome are given the privilege of the paradise of God and the constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ there will never be any separation from him where he goes his bride will go what is he shares with his beloved on a joint ha relationship the secret things will be revealed the dark things will be made plain we shall know as we are known amen not as we were known but as we are known because God doesn't have a yesterday God doesn't have a tomorrow God is I am Hallelujah so there is a way he has always known and he says we shall know as we are known so once we in church we are growing to the revelation of who we are amen yes sir and we shall be like him this is the heritage of the Overcomer who was overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of the testimony of Jesus Christ do you love him this morning amen so our inheritance is that we shall be like him but then this like him is a growing development amen we are a developing character amen and one of these days we shall become the expression of his eternal mind because he knew us he for the foundation of the world so as we keep growing we are growing to come to the realization of what we shall be amen so the Bible says that our names we placed on the L's book of life but what are these names are you together with me yes sir there is my brother M here he is called rers you can never find Rogers and you cannot find here so what's the name in the Lamb's Book of Life this is where I want you to come to a realization let me tell you friends we come from God and we have to go back to now your name in the L's Book of Life and your name here on Earth they are two different names Rogers was given by a father either as a CL name and the name Rogers either from anywhere he picks that name and is now roers and the father calls him Mambo rers and then he came to realize as he grows up that that's my name roers and then yes Mommy that's a natural name but then your name in the Lamb's Book of Life is not R so what is this name some of the people may say I want to get myself a Bible name so if I am James or John or Peter then my name is in the L's Book of Life that's not what it means because your name in the Lamb's Book of Life is not known by [Music] other are you together with me so what is the name a name I've always told you is the expression of character the principle behind names is to identify the character that's how names were given in the Bible they were given to underline the character okay and Adam said this is now Bor of my Bor and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man Adam wakes up from the sleep he touched hiside and there was a missing rib and then when he looked there was a woman there and says you you came from born of my B you've come from Flesh of My Flesh you will be called woman because you came from me so that name identified the nature of Eve the Bible says and the child grew and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and became her son and she called his name Moses because I dream out of the water are you together with me so all places and all people All Occasions were named because of the circumstance so the natural names which were given to the Patriarchs it defined their inheritance brother Bram gave us the example and he said Ephraim epim means by the Sea so when Joshua was giving the inheritance he gave Ephraim by the are you together with me so now the name you can look at you know when the nature was changing God changed the names of these people like Abram he was he didn't have a child but when the promise came God called him Abraham to underline a new character that he was going to express and then sah SAR SAR she became Sarah because she was going to become a mother Jacob was born a supp but when his nature was changed of God he changed the name and called him Israel are you together with me Peter was Simon when he got the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ he says Thou Peter is giving him a new name to underline a new character somebody say Amen there and then Saul becomes PA are you together with me becomes PA because there is a new manifestation of life so the name speaks of who you are I'm now not talking about this natural names and now God in Abraham Sarah Jacob Saul he participated in in changing the names natural names to teach us that there is a name that God knows us about so since the name speak of character then there is a character that God knows Us by and that's the name so the name in the last book of life is the cor of the elect that God has given him to manifest are you together with me he gave you a certain form of life that you are going to manifest so in Ephesians 1 verse according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should [Music] be that we should be so there is a stat God knew you and that God had determined that you are going to manifest that condition before you leave this Earth so in our election we find that that character is closely linked to the life of the Lamb are you together with me so your name in the last book of life means your character which is closely linked to the nature of the Lamb is not shw you find in church people that are going to be shrew you never understand them that's not the lamb so if you in the book your nature and character is closely linked to the lamb and now the lamb has got his way of life are you together with me so your name in the Lamb's Book of Life is your character which is like the life of the [Music] Lamb which is written in this book are you together with me so in our election our character is linked to the nature of the Lamb we grow towards the nature of the Lamb the more we feed on the word is the more of the Lamb nature we develop are you together with me God knew we're going to have the nature amen that was going to be redeemable in nature that would be comp to the lamb now look at the C of the Lamb when a lamb gets lost he can never recover himself and when a true child of God Strays sometimes it's difficult for them to realize the devil is taking them off the track they keep going m and he doesn't know where it's going you need a Ministry to keep you in the beaten path you are just a lamp you can easily stray and when the lamb is going to the slaughter it is always led by a god so you get a God in a congregation and it's reading the the god [Music] the and the prophet tells us once it gets to the Trap the goat jumps and the lamb is CAU God be merciful that we may have the life of the Lamb amen so th where he place your name as a particular character and that character is your adoption amen that's your adoption predestinated us after the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself so your name in the last book of life is the expression of divine character amen the nature of God blessing [Music] your amen so then that nature of God that's where your name is that's what we call the written epistle in life that you live so in plain language your name is the manifestation of the Holy Ghost in your life that's your new name listen let's go to Revelation 2 verse1 17 he that has a near let him hear what the spirit says out the churches to will I give him to eat of the Hidden manner and he'll give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man know saving he that receives it so this name here is not written on the story Stone as the luganda translation WR it's written in the stone and that name if it was on the stone then everybody would know what it is but it's written in the stone so that he that has an ear he that has the Gen of God once he breaks six Revelation and this Revelation is the foundation of a White Rock you are standing on the Revelation and once that Revelation breaks you get a new name you get the character of the Holy Ghost to lead you on this Earthly Journey so you become a new name you become a new character you are not the old now no you become a new name you become a new character you become the written epistle you see where I'm coming from it's only that that can hear the calling of the name in the preaching of the word is only the elect whose Divine character can be restored because it was right there before the foundation of the world that's the way God knew you so we in the understanding of how God has always known us so in the white stone of Revelation in the white stone of Revelation is where we find the name and that name is personal to [Music] holder which no man know that receive praise God Amen so these names are hidden in the word and therefore revealed by the word when I preach the word and you take the Revelation and you live by it answering back to your name amen thou Peter and upon this Revelation I will build my church listen to what brother Bram says here the book doesn't say is to be saved in time of this church age okay no it don't say that it only shows the mystery Hallelujah the book doesn't say will be saved in this generation no the way the name is is by bringing the mystery and when you receive the mystery as Revelation you are answering to your name that's your name in the book he just said behold I sent you Elijah the prophet but then for you to catch that revelation of that elah then that means you are the one they will say you I will send you and once you get the revelation you are answering to your name when you see the word says repent and then you realize the word is talking to you that's your name are you together with me when the word says forgive one another and you forgive you take it knowing he is talking to me then your name in the bck it begins the word changes your character and as the word keeps changing your character then you are manifesting your new name hallelujah hallelujah so but by constantly being the word we become a developing character you see when I was coming here I was thinking along the way but I am a teacher of hope I teach hope I don't teach despair I don't teach desp no I want you to know that you are part of the program of God if I was not a teacher of hope I would come down here and make you feel a sinner but because I'm a teacher of hope I know you are going to overcome amen I place the system the method the principle by which you can overcome and he always knows the end from the beginning he says that the works will finish from the foundation of the world are you together with me the works were finished from the foundation of the world and when we come to the end of the journey he just says come and take the kingdom which was prepared for you before the foundation why because he knew you so he prepared the Kingdom so what I'm doing is to preach away the fog so that you can know who you are in the plan of God if that mist goes away then you start saying thank God I am a child of God I overcame this even that I'm going to yes sir you are not called out to be destroyed in the wilderness you were called to be Joshua and Cal to go and inherit your position amen praise God Amen listen to brother here watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a spe of Stardust before God was God because God is an object of adoration God is an object of adoration and no one who was there to worship Him so he was at that time only potentially God Amen so he's talking about before there were Angels because the creation of angels made the worshipers and then God became God before that he was a creator he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not are you together with me listen the prophet is telling you even before God created the Angels you were in the mind of God but then is telling you here that the thoughts of God are Eternal then he asks are they not the thoughts of God are Eternal so the reason why you believe is because we're in the mind of God that's what I've always told you from John 52424 the holy spirit says here in five uh 24 amen verily verily I say unto you he that Hearth my word now the word hear is present continuous meaning he that keeps himself in my where and Believe on him that sent me has everlasting life you have everlasting life that's why you are continuing in the word you may have battles you may have weaknesses you may have failures that's just F and that's what we are trying to preach out that you can become clear at the center of light and you become the light of the world you were in God before the foundation of the world and he says God's thoughts are Eternal are they not so why do you have eternal life is it because you came to the Altar and you knelt down no you have eternal life because were in God and then you drank you smoked you did everything else that was just a fog that was surrounding you but you come to a time when you discover who you are and once you discover you can never fail I made my decision not because I wanted to please brother so and so only I wanted to breing sister so and so I made my decision because Revelation came to me that I've always been a Son of God and then you decide to walk away from the darkness into the light you are God's Eternal thoughts and these thoughts here are totally different from your thoughts your thoughts are ideas but the thoughts of God is an existence they are not a meditation that one day when I get money I build a house like this and like this and like this you are beginning the thoughts of man always have a beginning but the thoughts of God have always been they for they Eternal this is deep isn't it to discover who you are let's go to this quotes here he says the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal the prophet said the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you'll see many things that's not me saying now that's brother Bram that if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both and behavior we have studed and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as God must be ominent if is omn then he's not now learning nor is he taking Cel even with himself is he any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then is not omnis the best we could say is that some time he be but that's not scripture are you together with me understand the mind of God he's omnicient he's not taking new knowledge he's not adding anything to his understanding and he doesn't even draw his to his own bre no no no no no that's not God he's omniscent he has never had a new thought about anything because all he thoughts he has always had and always will have and know the end from the beginning because he God thus the thoughts of God is eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint which he has grown up and one day will be translated in substance and form but the thoughts of God are already real and eternal and the part of God hallelujah hallelujah he says if you understand this you'll understand a lot of that the mind of God is not like the mind of a man the mind of God is eternal God doesn't see you as a struggling baby God sees you as a crowned Christian are you together with me he wants to see you there that's why he SS the word so that you may develop into the mind of God as he saw you from before the foundation of the world where as Eternal as God is eternal we existed in God has an eternal thought are you together with me I've always given you demonstration amen that we come from God and God a piece of himself of himself just like this and then he made man but he remains the main body so now when he made man he made him in the image and likeness and that image and likeness was his spirit and this Spirit which made Adam and Eve was eternal as God was eternal but when he placed them in the body there was a fall but God says no I'm going to redeem man do you know why because if this way Eternal and they were part of God how can they get destroyed how can you cut off your hand and survive happily he says no I will redeem my portion and for 6,000 years God has been redeeming back his to bring it back to himself and that person is his own Spirit which he endorses in his own bride so in the internal Dimension the thoughts of God are unexist we were in the waiting for our season now listen they are etern the thoughts of God God doesn't speak like you I'll give you an example of the prophet Isaiah the prophet Isaiah was prophesying about the coming of Christ and then he says unto us a son is born that is God everybody look around where where tell us the village tell us the mother but as far as God is concerned he has no future unto us a son is born but God in his great wisdom he to come into the of and also go back into his own way I'll take you to Isaiah 53 and then verse two you know he has told us a son is born for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant 532 and as a root out of a dry ground he has no form no C and when we shall see there's no beauty that we should desire of it so Isaiah in this verse speaks about Christ from the standpoint of man and he says he shall grow up and when we shall see him then he switches back in the standpoint of God and says he has no cess see because he is reading from an eternal existence so the future standing before for God is a present reality that's the mind of God Amen listen to verse three he is despise and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and he does wear our faces from him he was despised and resed him not so before God all things are in present but Isaiah starts in the position of man to watch us as God would watch us when we touch into the expression of his mind Isaiah would stand back and then sh but then he says here a son is born so he stands out and he watches you how you H from Abram to Abraham from Jacob to Israel from Simon to Peter from Saul to Paul he has called us to be holy and without blem he stays back here and watches you as you hat out you hat out of the bar you hat out of a GBL you hat out of every kind of stuff and everything is bringing you out of you are manifesting glory to another glory to another glory to another Glory until you bring forth the image that God saw from before the foundation that's how God is dealing with us he knows the struggles or our path he knows our trials through all your trials you Prest of the adoption of sons because those trials are necessary to build your character so you were in the mind of God but God allowed you to bypass your the so that you can come here to bet tray are you together with me to be try your patience will be try your love will be try your family life will be try because you came here to be Tred and when you overcome you get back into your image rejoice when the Trials come your way and War you if you are the cause of Lamentations of the Saints brother Bram says but you bypass the and become flesh man to be temped by sin it is sin that tempts you so what did we bypass in in the because we bypassed a character of Glory we bypassed and we came into the body to be try in the body here you may not even realize that you are a son of God that was in the mind of God John believed it but there were still an element that he needed for the Assurance of his salvation and John lifted him I mean God lifted him and said come up here dealt with his experience and it changed the life of John something will have to happen to change our lives amen so Jesus when he was coming here on Earth he came through that glorious character and he knew all things but then in that glorious character it's not only knowledge we bypassed but we bypassed a spiritual condition God brought us here to overcome in order to step into that character of glory amen praise the Lord I make it it has been hard on me through the service but the Lord is gracious amen and that's why John says see you need to discover yourself listen to John 47 he discovered who he was he says hearing is our love made perfect joh first John 4:17 here in is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment what gives you boldness on the day of judgment John says because as he is so are we in this world that gives you boldness on the day of judgment that as he is his spirit in a body amen which is glorify so are we in this world we are Spirit of his Spirit Although our bodies are not glorified yet as he is so are we so we should hide that Glory behind the curtains of time hallelujah hallelujah the Glorious nature of Christ Is Now hidden behind the curtain of time this here is the curtain but inside there there is the glory like the glory that he is so is the glory that we are but sometimes we look at one another from the Flesh and once we lose the revelation of who we are we may not be able to make it when I see you let me see the glory of God when I shake the hand of Ben bless you let it be from my heart when I say I forgive you my brother let it come from the we should stop operating by the flesh the Christian is the seed on the inside of you together with me this okay let me give you this quot we by okay to come in this body but after been Tri and we've overcome then we join back our and we are connected to the same Glory that Jesus is now but the we have is that we have that Glory already here in the C of time listen thean is the human body that's glorified not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in its glorified state but it is a form of a human body that doesn't eat that doesn't drink it's a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this world now in here in there we enter into that body and that's the kind of body that God was he for he said let us make man in our image and in our likeness So Adam in Genesis 1 was a body of Glory when we overcome these bodies of malice speaking out of us we shall join those B is of Glory again so the word Glory what does it mean the body of Glory it is that brightness is that Splendor is that Excellence is the majest like which surrounds the angels God in a pillar of fire Glory means the most glorious condition it refers to the condition of God in heaven that's what the glory we missed is and when we overcome we join back into that glory amen is that glorious condition of blessing so in that nature was all the character of God embedded let us make Mone in our image and then Adam was Spirit of his Spirit God had L Adam all his attributes and he says let Adam be the God on Earth and Rule all the creation I will be the God in heaven are you together with me so in that nature was all the character of God and God pass all his authority and all his power and All His glory to Adam on Earth and then the Bible says God blessed him and in that blessing he was fruitful he would multiply and replace the Earth subdue it and have dominion that's where I failed and for 6,000 years that's what God has been restoring one of this in the day in the mum we shall be in that promise I'll teach on things that are to be one day you see people are saying we are going to heaven those people who don't like to work brother they are waiting for heaven in heaven you'll be there for three and a half years and then come back what Adam fail to do with the Earth is what you are going to do he was given a body to te the ground Hallelujah Hallelujah see one of these days we shall realize who we are what God had in his mind amen so after the New Birth then God restores that character back to us but he hides that character in the word do you want to find out who you are you go to the word the word is what reveals you as you study the word you become a developing character so second Peter 1 verse4 I'm finishing in a few minutes amen yes sir yes so second Peter 1 verse4 whereby are given unto us the exceeding great and precious promises in the world that by these promises in the world we might be partakers of a divine nature how do we have the nature of God back God hid it in the word and as you study that word it reveals the nature of God and as you take that nature you are taking your adoption you are taking the new name you are taking the new character amen so listen to what he says here now we see the attribute signs of his Spirit have not yet entered into the word from body but this body is subject to the word amen waiting for the Hest ch of the body amen he said when that Spirit join in there it is honest and looking for the change of the body so an attribute is an Inseparable property amen so all of us from Adam to the last elected one we are attribute sons of God and we must grow back into the image he saw us by amen that's my desire Lord help me that I may grow into the mind of God different ways God deals with us God help me to come to what you want me to be help me to come and devour into the mind that God s me back before the foundation of the world that's my prayer and that's your prayer and how can we get there by being in this word that's where he has hidden the steps so as you study the word your life will become brighter today you the word it becomes brighter tomorrow the word it becomes brighter next week why because the transforming power has been hidden in the world Amen we are developing into an eternal image God bless you [Applause] amen we are [Applause] devop Eternal mind god of love the god of love is going to stand by yourself because he will never lose any of us he cannot and he will not God bless you God bless you the name like brother Bram says is not no it's not but your nature that has been laid out in the word was you catch it that's your new name and God will help you to develop along the line of where God has called you to be and the way he uses you and helps you to go up is not the way is going to deal with another brother because every one of us is a unique character don't stand and point fingers at me point fingers at yourself Lord help me don't point at your brother point at your sister father help me to devolve into the mind of God that way God will open channels of Revelation in the world fill it with power transformation one day
