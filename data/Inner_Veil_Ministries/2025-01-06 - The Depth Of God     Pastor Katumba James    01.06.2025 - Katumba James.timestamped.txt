[16:12] Oh,

[16:18] life are.
[16:22] Oh,
[16:24] why
[16:26] grace
[16:29] I mere be thou my guide, Lord.
[16:35] Be
[16:37] thou my God.
[16:43] Be darkness done today.
[16:47] Be
[16:51] darkness. Wipe sorrows tears away. Oh
[16:55] Lord, just
[16:58] watch
[17:01] sorrow tears. No, let me ever stray from
[17:05] thee aside. Oh
[17:09] Lord, let
[17:12] [Music]
[17:15] me
[17:16] straight
[17:18] from him.
[17:21] [Music]
[17:26] Amen. Let us pray.
[17:29] Father, how we thank you Lord Jesus
[17:32] Christ. Our faith looks up to you
[17:36] Lord. Now the Bible tells
[17:39] us that without
[17:41] faith it is impossible to please God.
[17:45] You even told us in your
[17:47] word that they that come unto the
[17:51] Lord must believe that God
[17:54] is and is a rewarder of them that
[17:57] diligently seek
[17:59] him. We pray that father as we hear your
[18:03] word
[18:05] tonight mix it with
[18:08] faith bring such
[18:10] results which it is intended to do.
[18:14] bless us all together heavenly
[18:16] father and speak to us
[18:19] again in the name of the lord Jesus
[18:21] grant us this
[18:24] amen you may be seated
[18:27] I don't know if you have a song let us
[18:29] hear a song I' requested sister faith to
[18:32] sing this afternoon
[19:06] God bless you.
[19:14] There are
[19:15] many people who will say they're
[19:19] Christians and they live like Christians
[19:24] on the Sabbath day.
[19:29] But come
[19:30] Monday morning till the
[19:34] coming Sunday, they will fight their
[19:38] neighbor all along the way.
[19:44] If you don't love God, if you don't love
[19:50] your neighbor, if you
[19:53] gossip about him, if you never have
[19:57] mercy, if he gets into trouble and you
[20:03] don't try to help him, then you don't
[20:07] love your neighbor and you don't love
[20:11] God.
[20:14] In the
[20:16] Holy Bible, in the book of Matthew, read
[20:22] the
[20:23] 18th chapter in the 21st
[20:29] verse. Jesus
[20:32] plainly tells us that we must have
[20:36] mercy. There's a
[20:39] special warning in the thy
[20:45] fever. Oh, you don't love God. If you
[20:51] don't love your neighbor, if you go
[20:55] sleep about him, if you never have
[20:59] mercy, if he gets into trouble, and you
[21:05] don't try to help him, then you don't
[21:09] love your neighbor and you don't love
[21:15] God. Praise the
[21:18] God Almighty and you go to love him. If
[21:24] you want
[21:26] salation and hope on high.
[21:32] [Music]
[21:33] If you say you love him while you hate
[21:38] your brother, then you don't have
[21:43] religion. You just told the lie.
[21:49] If you don't love God, if you don't love
[21:55] your neighbor, if you
[21:58] gossip about him, if you never have
[22:03] mercy, if he gets in to trouble and you
[22:08] don't try to help him, then you don't
[22:12] love your neighbor and you don't love
[22:17] God.
[22:20] You don't love your neighbor and you
[22:24] don't love God.
[22:30] Amen.
[22:34] Amen. Amen. Praise the name of our Lord.
[22:38] If you don't love your
[22:39] neighbor, then you don't love God. You
[22:43] see, that's what the Bible says. How do
[22:45] you say that you love God?
[22:48] whom you don't see and you don't love
[22:50] the person whom you see. And then also
[22:53] the Bible says that true
[22:56] religion is to visit the sick, to help
[23:00] those who are in
[23:01] need. Praise the name of our God. It
[23:04] should be action
[23:06] based. Praise the name of our God. We
[23:09] thank God for
[23:10] that. Amen. Amen. So let us stand up to
[23:14] our Bibles.
[23:17] Praise the name of our Lord.
[23:22] Let us pray again. Father, we now
[23:25] appreciate you
[23:27] again and we pray that the Holy
[23:30] Spirit may come and speak to
[23:33] us and place the word in our
[23:36] hearts and make that word alive in our
[23:39] lives that all together we may live the
[23:42] life of Jesus Christ.
[23:45] Bless us as we read your word and as we
[23:46] hear
[23:48] it and you transform our
[23:51] lives depending upon you in the name of
[23:54] the Lord Jesus
[23:57] Christ. Amen. Amen. We go to Ephesians
[24:01] 3. I will take just maybe one
[24:05] hour. Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 16.
[24:11] The Bible says that he would grant you
[24:14] according to the riches of his glory to
[24:17] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[24:21] in the inner man.
[24:36] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[24:39] faith, that ye being rooted and grounded
[24:43] in love.
[24:54] may be able to comprehend with all
[24:57] saints what is the breadth and length
[25:01] and depth and height.
[25:19] and to know the love of Christ which
[25:23] passes knowledge that you may be filled
[25:26] with all fullness of
[25:41] God. May God sing of his word. You may
[25:44] be seated.
[25:47] We want to share on the depth of
[25:53] God. Praise the name of our Lord. The
[25:56] depth of
[25:58] God. And so the scriptures here we have
[26:02] read are talking about the depth of God.
[26:08] So he
[26:09] says that he would grant you according
[26:12] the riches of his
[26:16] glory to be strengthened with might
[26:21] by his
[26:23] spirit in the inner man. So then the
[26:27] Holy
[26:28] Spirit has to be in the inner
[26:32] man. Praise the name of the Holy Spirit
[26:35] dwelling within us.
[26:39] Praise the name of Lord. And so we are
[26:41] talking about the Holy
[26:43] Spirit. We are not talking about
[26:45] something that is far away from
[26:48] us. Praise the name of our Lord. Like
[26:51] you know some people when they talk
[26:52] about the Holy
[26:54] Spirit. They think the Holy Ghost is the
[26:57] other
[26:58] side. I'm this side. So now I have to
[27:03] move to where the Holy Ghost
[27:05] is. Actually, what happens? It's the
[27:09] Holy Ghost that comes to
[27:11] you. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[27:14] how does the Holy Spirit come to you?
[27:17] The Holy Ghost comes to
[27:18] you. Through the
[27:21] minister, because the Bible says, you
[27:24] know, the spirit
[27:26] says, and he says through the
[27:29] minister, through the person who
[27:31] testifies to
[27:33] you, it's the Holy Ghost speaking to
[27:35] you.
[27:36] As you obey the
[27:39] word, then the Holy Ghost starts working
[27:42] upon your
[27:43] life. You confess your sins, you repent.
[27:48] You know, you accept the Lord Jesus as
[27:50] your personal
[27:51] savior. As we had this brother here,
[27:55] completely
[27:56] rejected. Nobody wants to be close to
[28:00] him. Nobody wants to be near him.
[28:03] But then the Lord picks him in that kind
[28:05] of
[28:07] condition. He convicts his heart. Now
[28:10] when he's convicted, he says, "Lord,
[28:12] accept you as my
[28:14] person." He goes into the water
[28:17] baptism. Praise the name of our Lord.
[28:20] And then he is
[28:22] justified. And the more he comes into
[28:24] the presence of
[28:26] God, hears the word of
[28:29] God, he is
[28:31] washed. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[28:34] gets separated from the things that have
[28:36] been holding
[28:38] him. Maybe bad places he has been going
[28:41] to, he stops going there. Bad people he
[28:45] has been associating with, he stops
[28:47] them. Maybe bad thoughts he has been
[28:50] looking at, he puts them aside. bad
[28:54] programs he has been listening
[28:56] to on radio on television on on phones.
[29:01] He puts it aside. He is being
[29:05] sanctified. In other words, he's being
[29:07] separated from all those things which
[29:08] are not
[29:11] right. This is the work of the Holy
[29:14] Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit that
[29:18] justifies us. You can't justify
[29:21] yourself. It is the Holy Spirit that
[29:25] sanctifies us. You can't sanctify you.
[29:29] And when the Holy Ghost sanctifies you
[29:32] and knows your
[29:33] condition, then he comes himself and
[29:37] makes his permanent
[29:40] abboard right inside of you. The same
[29:44] Holy Spirit who brought
[29:47] conviction, who made you confess, who
[29:50] made you
[29:51] confent, who made you keep on coming to
[29:55] church, who made you love the word of
[29:57] God, who made you be obedient to the
[29:59] word of
[30:00] God, still working upon
[30:03] you. So you're not seeing the Holy Ghost
[30:05] is far, but he's right where you are,
[30:10] working upon your
[30:12] life. Praise the name of our lord. I
[30:14] remember there's a place I was
[30:16] in last year. I think it
[30:19] was and then I was like saying you know
[30:23] you're not saying that you are the holy
[30:25] ghost is in
[30:28] ginger we don't have the holy ghost.
[30:31] Then the question is how did you get
[30:33] saved? Did you save yourself?
[30:38] But you see that's the mind which people
[30:41] can get.
[30:44] and then thinking it's until I go to
[30:47] that
[30:48] church or until I hear that
[30:51] preacher. The Bible says don't say
[30:56] that. Praise the name of God has brought
[30:59] all that we have need of to
[31:02] us. Now your obedience to the Holy
[31:08] Spirit, it gets you into the depth of
[31:12] God. And you know the more you are
[31:16] obeying, the more you get
[31:18] obedient, the more the spirit speaks to
[31:21] you. And now when the spirit keeps on
[31:24] speaking to
[31:25] you, praise the name of then you are
[31:30] strengthened. Praise the name of Lord.
[31:32] So he says the spirit in the inner
[31:36] man and then in verse
[31:38] 17 that Christ may dwell in your
[31:45] hearts by faith. Praise the name of our
[31:48] Lord. Christ dwelling in our
[31:51] heart by faith in living that is within
[31:56] me not doubting oh I don't know whether
[31:59] I have him or I don't have him. So now
[32:03] when he is
[32:05] inside and Christ here we are talking of
[32:08] the
[32:10] spirit and the word. Praise the name of
[32:13] God that is Christ the anointed word of
[32:18] God dwelling in
[32:20] us inside our heart and then he says
[32:25] being
[32:27] rooted and then grounded in love.
[32:32] So when Christ is inside of
[32:35] you, he will create a desire for more of
[32:38] God inside of
[32:41] you, you will find that you need to hear
[32:44] more of God.
[32:47] Then the more of God you
[32:49] hear, the more of God you are obedient
[32:53] to. And so it becomes easy for you to
[32:57] fulfill the word of
[32:59] God in your life. Praise the name of our
[33:02] Lord. It becomes, you know,
[33:07] automatic. Praise the name of our Lord
[33:09] because it is part of you.
[33:12] And so when the devil tries to do some
[33:14] deception
[33:16] somewhere, then the word inside of
[33:19] you
[33:21] arises, this is not the thing of God. Or
[33:24] if you make a
[33:26] mistake, the word inside of you will
[33:30] convict you. You have thought
[33:33] wrong, you have spoken wrong, you have
[33:37] done wrong. Why? because he's
[33:40] inside. Christ is inside. He's a living
[33:45] reality. So he leads you from
[33:49] within. He leads you from inside of
[33:53] you inside of you. So now the more you
[33:57] yield to
[33:58] him, the more you hear the word, the
[34:02] more you hear the word, the more you
[34:04] read the word, the more you are obedient
[34:07] to the
[34:08] word, then you are getting further into
[34:10] the depth of
[34:12] God. You are being rooted and
[34:17] grounded. And then the Bible says that
[34:20] you may be able to
[34:23] comprehend you know with all the
[34:26] saints what is the
[34:30] breadest, what is the
[34:33] length, what is the
[34:35] depth and what is the
[34:38] height and not the love of
[34:42] Christ which passes
[34:46] knowledge. You know it you can't
[34:48] comprehend
[34:50] it. You can't explain
[34:53] it but it is a life that is inside of
[34:57] you that you might be filled with all
[35:00] the fullness of
[35:03] God. Praise the name of our Lord. Christ
[35:07] himself living inside of
[35:10] you doing his own
[35:13] work. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[35:16] in the message that church
[35:19] age he says they have not known the
[35:22] depth of
[35:24] Satan. It seems that this
[35:27] verse has been left out by the
[35:30] commentators for they were not able to
[35:32] figure it
[35:36] out. What doctrine or what experiences
[35:40] are meant by this
[35:42] phrase?
[35:44] Actually it is simple to know what it
[35:48] meant. Let us first know what the depth
[35:51] of God
[35:53] is and the
[35:57] opposite will be true for the depth of
[36:01] Satan. So he takes to the scripture
[36:03] we've been
[36:04] reading Ephesians chapter 3 verse 16 to
[36:08] verse
[36:10] 19. Then he says, "Now according to
[36:13] these
[36:14] verses, when a man experiences the depth
[36:18] of God in his
[36:23] life, it is an actual personal
[36:29] experience of the spirit of
[36:32] God in dwelling in
[36:35] him and in his
[36:38] mind is illuminated by wisdom and
[36:43] knowledge through the
[36:46] word. Praise the name of the Lord. He
[36:49] says the depth of
[36:51] God is actually a personal
[36:55] experience of the spirit of
[36:58] God dwelling in
[37:01] you and then your
[37:03] mind is illuminated by the wisdom and
[37:07] knowledge of God.
[37:10] through the word of God. Now when I'm
[37:13] talking about the personal
[37:16] experience, you know, some people want
[37:18] to put experience to how I feel
[37:21] emotional, run
[37:23] around. That's not what I'm talking
[37:26] about. I'm talking about the reality of
[37:28] the life of Jesus
[37:31] Christ living in
[37:33] you. And that reality of Christ living
[37:36] in you
[37:39] does not leave
[37:42] you. It is something you are certain in
[37:45] your
[37:46] life. Sure, the Lord is in my
[37:49] life. Not how I can explain
[37:53] it. You know the other year I had an
[37:57] experience. I'm talking about something
[38:01] that is real even
[38:04] now in your life.
[38:07] Not something you can tell me
[38:09] back. Something which is
[38:12] there, an
[38:15] experience. You have an actual
[38:18] experience of the spirit of
[38:21] God and it dwelling in
[38:24] you not dwelt in
[38:28] you. No, we are talking about something
[38:33] now. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[38:35] know, people want to look for how I
[38:39] felt even me. I have the Holy
[38:43] Ghost because I got it the other time.
[38:47] And then you ask him, "How about now?"
[38:49] But I have the Holy Ghost. Where is the
[38:52] life of the Holy
[38:53] Ghost? They don't have the
[38:56] life. But they can point to those things
[38:59] of emotions or
[39:02] sensations. But now you you bring their
[39:04] seed,
[39:07] their
[39:08] fruit, nothing is
[39:12] there. They can
[39:15] hate. Is that the Holy
[39:19] Ghost? They can do anything
[39:22] wrong. Where is the
[39:25] spirit? You know the spirit of God is a
[39:28] river of
[39:31] life. Like we have N
[39:34] here. Have you ever gone wonder and
[39:36] found N is not
[39:42] flowing? That's not the spirit of God.
[39:45] It keeps
[39:47] flowing. Now there are
[39:49] places when it is dry.
[39:55] You know there are some
[39:57] places there's a place I went
[39:59] to and then you see
[40:03] ahead they call the name this
[40:07] river river sand. So now when you reach
[40:10] the place there's no
[40:14] water but there's no water here. That's
[40:17] a
[40:18] river. That's not the Holy
[40:21] Spirit. That's not the Holy Spirit. Why
[40:24] doesn't yours keep
[40:26] flowing? You can afford to
[40:29] hate. You can afford to
[40:32] despise. You can do anything
[40:35] bad. But then you are basing on the
[40:38] other thing. I got it the other time.
[40:40] Why isn't it
[40:43] flowing? Why isn't it
[40:45] flowing? Because it's a river. It keeps
[40:49] flowing.
[40:51] There is a brother who told
[40:53] me some years ago, my wife has got the
[40:57] Holy
[40:59] Ghost. She got the Holy Ghost the other
[41:03] service. That is good. Thank God. And
[41:06] now she told the
[41:08] husband. I don't need to go to church
[41:11] because I got the Holy
[41:13] Ghost.
[41:17] Contrary. And some people want to get
[41:22] that for me going to heaven. It is
[41:24] finished. That's not it. It's a
[41:28] life. It keeps
[41:32] flowing. Praise the name of the Lord.
[41:34] And that's in other words, every other
[41:37] day you have a testimony of what the
[41:41] Lord is doing in your
[41:42] life. Praise the name of our oneoff
[41:46] event.
[41:47] I'm sure the Lord is in my life. I'm
[41:50] sure I have the Holy
[41:52] Spirit. The life he gives
[41:54] me. The grace he gives me to overcome
[41:57] the
[41:57] temptations. The grace he gives me to
[41:59] overcome with situations that come along
[42:01] my
[42:06] way. It's not that you and then you
[42:09] buried.
[42:10] [Music]
[42:14] How you tell somebody I gave birth
[42:18] and then you can't show the birth you
[42:21] gave. When did you give birth 10 years?
[42:25] Where is what you gave
[42:27] birth? It's not there. That's not what
[42:31] we talking about. We're talking about a
[42:34] life. Something that is continuous in
[42:39] you, not a one
[42:41] off. We had that sister.
[42:45] Everybody knew that sister has the Holy
[42:48] Spirit and the sister's backs and she
[42:51] does she
[42:53] hates. Now we don't know what's
[42:55] happening. That's not the experience
[42:57] we're talking
[42:59] about. We are talking about a current
[43:04] life. I received the Holy Ghost 10 years
[43:07] ago and even now I have a testimony that
[43:11] the Holy Ghost lives me.
[43:13] That's what we are talking about. Not
[43:15] what I I I can show 10 years ago even
[43:19] now to tell you
[43:21] my every day I walk a blood of the
[43:26] spirit. Praise the name of God. Those
[43:28] are the
[43:29] things. So he's saying the depth of
[43:33] God. So you don't get into the depth and
[43:37] then you say I'm out of it
[43:40] now. It is a continuous
[43:43] experience. It's a continuous
[43:48] communication. Let us speak it from here
[43:50] now. 1 Corinthians chapter or let us
[43:53] first go to Romans chapter
[43:56] 8. Then we can come back to 1
[43:58] Corinthians chapter
[44:01] 2. So the Bible says in Romans chapter
[44:05] 8 and then verse
[44:09] 14, for you have not received the spirit
[44:12] of bondage again to fear, but you have
[44:15] received a spirit of adoption whereby
[44:18] you cry aba father.
[44:24] That's
[44:35] 15. So he says the spirit of
[44:39] adoption and to be
[44:42] adopted mean there is a growth you pass
[44:46] through. There is a change which comes
[44:49] in your life.
[44:52] It's a
[44:53] growth. Praise the name of Lord. You
[44:56] take authority of
[44:58] God. But then how will you get into full
[45:03] adoption? Praise the name of Lord. So
[45:06] how you can get into full
[45:09] adoption. Verse 14 has to be
[45:13] fulfilled. For as many as are led by the
[45:16] spirit of
[45:19] God, they are the sons of
[45:22] God. The Bible says, "As many as are
[45:28] led, he doesn't lead you only one
[45:31] day. He doesn't lead you only one year,
[45:34] but all your
[45:37] lifetime, the Holy Ghost leads you.
[45:41] Praise the name of He puts in your mind
[45:44] to come to
[45:45] church. He puts in your mind when
[45:48] somebody is bringing a
[45:51] program. When somebody is bringing any
[45:54] program or
[45:56] activity on Sunday, I have to be in
[45:59] church. The Holy Ghost is taking
[46:02] charge. When you go home, you know, he
[46:05] puts it in your
[46:06] mind, do this, do this. When you go to
[46:10] bed, you are thinking about God. When
[46:13] you wake up, he's putting it in you. I
[46:17] need to commit the day to the Lord. I'm
[46:19] going to meet so and so. I'm going to do
[46:22] this and this. I'm going to do this and
[46:24] this. He guides you in every one of
[46:27] those
[46:29] things. Maybe during lunch
[46:31] time, I don't like that place. I went
[46:35] there and there was a lot of secular
[46:37] music.
[46:38] I don't like that. You stop going
[46:41] there. Somebody comes to you, they all
[46:44] the time
[46:45] backbiting,
[46:47] abusing, you avoid their
[46:50] company. The Holy Spirit, leading you,
[46:55] making you avoid those funny
[46:57] places. Maybe your colleagues are going
[46:59] to the
[47:00] club, you know, in the evening or come
[47:04] to golf course. You're a big person in
[47:06] the in the
[47:08] organization. We have a corporate
[47:11] night. Ah, you need to be there. Is
[47:14] going to be
[47:16] there. Business
[47:18] opportunity, good
[47:20] networking. What?
[47:22] What? But they are talking evil all the
[47:26] time. They vulgar language all the time.
[47:29] The Holy Spirit in you will not sit and
[47:32] feed those things. You say no. Okay, we
[47:36] shall meet in my
[47:39] office. It's the Holy
[47:42] Spirit every day is leading
[47:44] you not only on
[47:47] Sunday. No, it is something that is
[47:50] continuous in your
[47:52] life is led by the Holy Spirit. And as
[47:56] the Holy Spirit leads
[47:58] you, he's tutoring you. He's teaching
[48:02] you, he's instructing you, you know, you
[48:05] walk, turn left, and you turn left. Turn
[48:10] right. You turn right. Stop here. Stop.
[48:14] Walk. You walk. Don't speak anything.
[48:17] You keep quiet now. Speak. You speak.
[48:21] Leadership of the Holy Spirit. Like a
[48:23] post saying I'm a prison of
[48:26] Christ. Praise the name of when there
[48:29] was some woman with evil spirits and
[48:33] then she was moving in that city telling
[48:35] the people. This is Paul the servant of
[48:39] God who preaches Jesus Christ bringing
[48:42] good news. He stayed it for a long time
[48:46] and Paul was the Holy Spirit was holding
[48:49] him but now the Holy Ghost told him
[48:53] rebuke that
[48:54] spirit then he cast out a demon from
[48:57] her being led by the spirit of God.
[49:01] That's how the Holy Spirit
[49:03] lives. So you don't say I got the
[49:05] baptism of the Holy
[49:10] Spirit. No,
[49:13] it's a life and it is
[49:16] continuous. So the Bible says as many as
[49:20] a led of the spirit of
[49:23] God, they are the sons of God. So when
[49:26] the Holy Ghost leads
[49:28] us brings us into
[49:32] adoption, the Bible says we have not got
[49:35] a spirit of
[49:38] bondage, but we have received a spirit
[49:41] of
[49:43] adoption. We cry aba, father,
[49:47] So the spirit in you will always make
[49:50] you long for
[49:52] God. Lord, I desire more of
[49:55] you. I desire more of you. When you make
[49:58] a mistake, Lord, forgive me. Lord, help
[50:02] me in this weakness. Lord, guide me in
[50:04] this kind of the Holy Spirit making you
[50:08] to
[50:09] cry. Father, Lord, I need your help.
[50:13] Lord, I feel I'm not able to go through,
[50:15] but Lord, give me ability
[50:17] to get the Holy Spirit in you. Praise
[50:21] the name of our Lord. It's an experience
[50:23] you
[50:24] have continuously in your
[50:27] life, a life that is lived in you. Then
[50:31] the Bible says in verse
[50:33] 16, the spirit itself bears witness with
[50:37] our spirit.
[50:41] Now that the Holy
[50:43] Spirit has
[50:45] witness with our human
[50:48] spirit that we are the children of
[50:51] God. How does that come? Because your
[50:54] human
[50:56] spirit before the Holy Spirit
[50:59] came was subject to the things of the
[51:03] world. Was subject to the spirit of the
[51:07] devil. was influenced by the things of
[51:09] this
[51:10] world. Like for
[51:13] sisters, when you have the spirit of the
[51:16] world, the spirit of the world will take
[51:19] over
[51:19] you until every fashion and
[51:26] [Music]
[51:28] style. The way they mold
[51:31] things all the time your heart is
[51:34] taken. How you want you want to make
[51:37] your body
[51:39] tight every part to be
[51:42] shown and you know designs keep on
[51:45] coming.
[51:47] Yesterday I was attending an
[51:49] introduction then I got
[51:51] shocked quite middleaged
[51:56] person came I have a song they put the
[52:00] song then she started you know in her
[52:03] dress what
[52:06] Now when she was going
[52:07] back I got shocked the whole back was
[52:12] open
[52:15] said
[52:17] fashion. Then others they get a cross
[52:21] which just runs from here like
[52:25] this. This one is
[52:33] bare. Then
[52:35] others they get a cloth. It's like this.
[52:40] There is an ovel here on the on the on
[52:42] the shoulders here like
[52:51] this. What's happening?
[52:56] Then
[52:58] others they get a
[53:02] close on the side is bare
[53:07] just only tying some kind of
[53:12] knot styles of the
[53:15] world. They are bound by that spirit.
[53:19] But when they are born
[53:21] again, the spirit of the world will not
[53:25] have control over
[53:26] them. Praise the name of our because
[53:29] those things are
[53:31] detestful. You hate
[53:34] it. Then
[53:36] others, you know those
[53:39] days people had gray used to put is it
[53:42] can or something black in their hair?
[53:51] I remember when I started seeing the
[53:53] white hair in my
[53:55] head. I don't know how many years ago,
[53:57] maybe 15 or 10. So I would go in the
[54:00] mirror and pull it
[54:03] out. But now there are many I
[54:10] can. And then some people when they see
[54:14] it's a lot of
[54:15] hair shall
[54:20] But I don't want
[54:27] But
[54:29] now people make their hair white
[54:34] deliberately, put on white
[54:37] hair, hair, green
[54:40] hair, fashions of the
[54:42] world. You know, it's a spirit that
[54:45] controls them.
[54:48] Some spirit inside of
[54:51] you is leading you like we have this
[54:54] afternoon
[54:56] service. Somebody who loves
[54:59] football said again. Why this afternoon
[55:03] service when my team is
[55:06] playing or can pretend to be
[55:09] around and the good thing now you can
[55:11] use your smartphone to know what's
[55:15] happening you you pretend as if you on a
[55:19] scripture then you flip the other
[55:24] side of the world just takes a hold of
[55:29] you just controls
[55:32] you to lead you to
[55:35] something. But the Bible says if you are
[55:38] led of the spirit of
[55:40] God then your human
[55:43] spirit will
[55:45] say pleasures of this
[55:51] life I have renounced them. Praise the
[55:55] name of I've renounced this
[55:58] life. I've renounced all those filthy
[56:02] places. I've renounced those corporate
[56:06] nights. I've renounced those social
[56:08] social
[56:10] places. I've renounced those
[56:14] joints
[56:19] joints. You know those
[56:21] people, they each other's saliva.
[56:29] So
[56:32] telephone and they just
[56:36] there's a place I I think I was
[56:39] on
[56:42] road and I had stopped in a place
[56:46] called I think I because I was going
[56:48] back
[56:49] to I finished preaching
[56:52] in and where I
[56:55] stopped on the
[56:57] died there was a home and people were
[57:02] gathered they just
[57:05] drinking and then one called me you are
[57:09] welcome I told him you need to get
[57:15] saved but for them they are
[57:19] bound they enjoy their
[57:23] stuff there's a time we had I think it
[57:25] was a youth three treatier on the banks
[57:28] of river
[57:31] N was last year. It was a
[57:35] Saturday and I tell you
[57:38] what
[57:40] came they either came with their
[57:44] motorcycles, short dresses
[57:47] and going all over making beer
[57:52] everything they are bound.
[57:55] Then there's another one who came then
[57:58] he said you know me I work on this radio
[58:02] this and this challenge about
[58:06] salvation said but now the things I do
[58:10] this and this still
[58:14] bound they find that their life is
[58:17] missing if they don't do those evil
[58:20] things but now when the Holy Spirit
[58:23] comes and takes over that
[58:26] place. You will hate those
[58:29] things. You'll detest those
[58:33] things. You'll even forget about
[58:36] them. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[58:39] even don't know the the song which like
[58:41] if people like secular
[58:43] music, they know which song is most
[58:46] trending.
[58:48] This one they hit it has this number of
[58:51] hits.
[58:53] But you know this song even in Kenya
[58:56] it's number
[58:57] one in Tanzania
[59:00] it's ah
[59:05] like yesterday I was an introduction
[59:07] and now this were playing secular
[59:10] music and then they were and I was
[59:13] shocked. Can you imagine there also
[59:16] ushers a group of girls who make
[59:17] themselves a group of
[59:21] ushers? Yes. And then they put on
[59:25] uniform and say we you can also call us
[59:28] we handle your functions
[59:31] [Music]
[59:33] wedding. I didn't know that. I was like
[59:37] hey but now they were able to sing every
[59:40] song in their mind.
[59:45] found caught up in a
[59:49] stress. When when they say,
[59:53] they want to walk
[59:55] like
[59:58] bound, it's a spirit that's within
[1:00:01] them. And then you get some of these
[1:00:04] young
[1:00:06] children how they can break
[1:00:12] dance
[1:00:16] bound. And then you get big people
[1:00:18] cheering
[1:00:21] them. Same
[1:00:25] spirits. Same spirits.
[1:00:28] But then when you have the Holy
[1:00:30] Spirit, you don't want those kind of
[1:00:33] things. Even you don't want to put them
[1:00:35] on your
[1:00:37] phone
[1:00:39] for then you start feeding on
[1:00:48] them. Therefore, why are you watching
[1:00:52] them? You're also feeding on the
[1:00:58] But when you have the Holy
[1:01:00] Spirit, the Holy Ghost will bring you to
[1:01:05] adoption. In other words, it molds your
[1:01:09] image to the image of
[1:01:12] Jesus. So you will cut off those
[1:01:15] things until those people start telling
[1:01:22] you. When they talk about drinks, you're
[1:01:25] talking about
[1:01:27] water. You have water at
[1:01:29] home. Talk about whisk. Talk
[1:01:35] about
[1:01:37] this. You even don't know the names of
[1:01:39] those brands.
[1:01:42] There's one which says keep walking.
[1:01:47] You even don't know. You just say I
[1:01:48] don't know even this thing. What is it?
[1:01:50] Spirit of
[1:01:51] God
[1:01:53] searches you know he goes
[1:01:57] out and then he brings those things to
[1:02:00] your
[1:02:02] knowledge. The deep things of
[1:02:05] God. He gives you an understanding.
[1:02:09] Praise the name of Lord about the things
[1:02:12] of
[1:02:13] God. You look what Moses being the
[1:02:17] almost becoming the next
[1:02:20] Pharaoh and then the spirit of
[1:02:23] God revealed to him that these Jews here
[1:02:28] are the hairs of
[1:02:30] God. So the Bible says despise the
[1:02:33] pleasures of life of
[1:02:35] God for a short season.
[1:02:39] And then he
[1:02:40] desired, he decided to suffer with the
[1:02:44] people of
[1:02:45] God because they had the promise of
[1:02:49] God. It was a
[1:02:51] revelation. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:02:54] He saw that these people
[1:02:56] here. They have an
[1:02:58] inheritance before God. But Egypt much
[1:03:02] as is the super
[1:03:03] power will perish will pass away. Then
[1:03:07] he made a better
[1:03:10] decision. So God made it known to
[1:03:13] me. And it's also the same thing that
[1:03:17] God makes known to
[1:03:19] us. The deep things of
[1:03:22] God, the things that are
[1:03:24] eternal, the things that are
[1:03:27] real. Look at the things of
[1:03:30] time. Praise the name of God. You're not
[1:03:33] getting yourself in a compromising
[1:03:35] situation.
[1:03:37] because of temporary things because of
[1:03:40] things that pass away. You are looking
[1:03:43] at the recompense of the
[1:03:46] reward. You are looking at the things of
[1:03:49] God greater
[1:03:52] riches and the things of
[1:03:54] this. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:03:57] that's how God does it to
[1:03:58] us. You don't look at your current
[1:04:02] condition. You move forward. You look to
[1:04:05] the promise of
[1:04:07] God. Praise the name of our Lord. Then
[1:04:10] he says, "For what man knoweth, the
[1:04:13] things of man, save the spirit of man
[1:04:15] which is in him, even so the things of
[1:04:18] God knows no man but the spirit of
[1:04:23] God." Verse seven,
[1:04:36] So it is the spirit of God which knows
[1:04:40] the things of God. And so when you have
[1:04:43] the spirit of
[1:04:44] God, the spirit of God will make the
[1:04:48] things of God known to
[1:04:51] you. Praise the name of. So the Holy
[1:04:54] Spirit
[1:04:56] illuminates your mind.
[1:05:00] and gives you the
[1:05:01] wisdom and knowledge of
[1:05:05] God through the word of
[1:05:07] God. So it gets you into the depth of
[1:05:12] God. You can never get into the depth of
[1:05:16] God without the word of
[1:05:18] God because it is the word of
[1:05:21] God that declares to us. Praise the name
[1:05:25] of our Lord. Who God is, what God is,
[1:05:30] and where God
[1:05:32] is. Praise the name of God. Then he
[1:05:35] says, "Now we have received not the
[1:05:37] spirit of the
[1:05:41] world, but the spirit which is of
[1:05:45] God, that we may not the things that are
[1:05:48] freely given to us of God."
[1:05:53] So he talks about the human
[1:05:55] spirit which is the spirit of man, the
[1:05:58] spirit of God which is the holy spirit
[1:06:02] and the spirit of the world which is
[1:06:05] Satan. So now when you are not born
[1:06:08] again your human
[1:06:11] spirit is bound by the spirit of
[1:06:14] satan. And now when you are born
[1:06:17] again, your human spirit is delivered
[1:06:21] from the spirit of the
[1:06:23] world. So it's the spirit of God which
[1:06:27] takes charge over your human
[1:06:29] spirit. And then the Bible says, our the
[1:06:32] Holy Spirit, bears
[1:06:36] witness with our human spirit that we
[1:06:39] are the children of
[1:06:40] God. And how would you prove it? as many
[1:06:44] as are led of the spirit of
[1:06:46] God, they are the children of
[1:06:49] God. So find out in
[1:06:51] yourself what leads
[1:06:56] me. Praise the name of the Lord. What
[1:06:59] leads
[1:07:00] me? What inspires me? If the Holy Ghost
[1:07:04] is within
[1:07:05] you, the Holy Ghost will inspire you,
[1:07:10] will lead you, will guide you. The Bible
[1:07:14] say when he the spirit of truth is
[1:07:17] come he will guide you into all
[1:07:22] truth truth the word. So the Holy Spirit
[1:07:27] guides us into all
[1:07:29] truth. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:07:32] then he says which things also we speak
[1:07:34] not in words with man's wisdom. Verse
[1:07:37] 13.
[1:07:44] but which the Holy Ghost teaches
[1:07:47] comparing spiritual things with
[1:07:55] spiritual. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:07:57] So it is the spirit of
[1:08:00] God that takes charge in
[1:08:03] us. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[1:08:06] the book of Acts 20:32,
[1:08:12] The Bible says, "And now,
[1:08:14] brethren, I commend you to God and to
[1:08:18] the word of his grace, which is able to
[1:08:21] build you up and to give you an
[1:08:24] inheritance among all them which are
[1:08:27] sanctified.
[1:08:40] Praise the name of our Lord. He says,
[1:08:42] I'm commending you to
[1:08:45] God and to the word of his
[1:08:48] grace which has the
[1:08:51] ability to build you
[1:08:54] up. Praise the name of God. In other
[1:08:56] words, to root
[1:08:59] you, you know, to see that you are
[1:09:01] established.
[1:09:04] So no wind of doctrine will come and
[1:09:06] toss you
[1:09:08] up. No kind of influence will
[1:09:11] come and then you say you know it's my
[1:09:15] boss who has told me that I should go to
[1:09:17] the corporate
[1:09:19] night. Now when you go in the corporate
[1:09:22] nightorate night opening the
[1:09:25] dance and then they call
[1:09:30] you. You don't allow those kind of
[1:09:33] things. Say
[1:09:35] no. This is what I stand
[1:09:39] for. Praise the name of you made a
[1:09:43] decision. I don't like that music. I
[1:09:46] don't like that kind of
[1:09:48] music. I don't want that kind of
[1:09:51] thing. Praise the name of you know you
[1:09:54] are built on the
[1:09:56] word. You know what the word of God
[1:09:58] says.
[1:10:00] So you stand by the
[1:10:02] word established by the word of
[1:10:05] God. Praise the name of Let us go to
[1:10:08] Colossians chapter 2 verse
[1:10:12] 6. Colossians chapter 2 verse
[1:10:16] 6. He says, "As you have therefore
[1:10:20] received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
[1:10:24] ye in him.
[1:10:32] rooted and built up in
[1:10:39] him and established in the
[1:10:44] faith as you have been
[1:10:47] taught, abounding there in with
[1:10:51] thanksgiving.
[1:10:55] Praise the name of the Lord. So it is
[1:10:57] something that should be continuous in
[1:10:59] our
[1:11:01] life. A life that you live. Praise the
[1:11:05] name of the Bible says man shall not
[1:11:08] live by bread
[1:11:09] alone by
[1:11:11] everyone that
[1:11:14] proceedth. It's
[1:11:16] continuous. You need the natural food to
[1:11:19] live. You need the spiritual food also.
[1:11:23] So you keep on
[1:11:25] longing and you see sometimes the Holy
[1:11:27] Spirit put something on your
[1:11:30] mind. Maybe it reminds you about a
[1:11:33] message or about a scripture. Take your
[1:11:36] time and follow that
[1:11:38] up. Okay, I've been thinking about
[1:11:41] it. Then you go and read it and then you
[1:11:44] see the Holy
[1:11:45] Spirit coming to give you more light
[1:11:49] on. Praise the name of our Lord. That's
[1:11:52] how the Lord does. And so when the devil
[1:11:55] is going to give an
[1:11:58] attack, the Holy Ghost has given you
[1:12:01] protection. Somebody come says this. But
[1:12:05] the word of God has told me or sometimes
[1:12:08] there are in
[1:12:10] life something ahead is going to
[1:12:13] happen and then the Holy Ghost puts a
[1:12:15] burden upon your
[1:12:17] life. You go and read this. to go and
[1:12:20] meditate upon
[1:12:24] hearing you for a
[1:12:28] challenger. And so when the devil
[1:12:31] come you are
[1:12:32] prepared. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:12:35] That's how the Holy Ghost works in our
[1:12:37] lives. That's how the Holy Spirit leads
[1:12:41] us. Sometimes you don't know what lays
[1:12:44] ahead. But God knows what lays ahead.
[1:12:50] Sometimes God can speak it. You hear a
[1:12:54] voice, praise the name over and then the
[1:12:57] voice tells you this and
[1:13:00] this. That's the Holy
[1:13:03] Spirit. It's all the time to lead
[1:13:06] us to guide
[1:13:09] us. God works in our
[1:13:11] lives. Praise the name of God. So it's
[1:13:14] not that you know I just guessed about
[1:13:17] it.
[1:13:20] God directs
[1:13:22] you. Praise the name of like I can give
[1:13:25] this testimony. I think it was just on I
[1:13:29] think it was
[1:13:31] Friday either it was
[1:13:34] Friday or
[1:13:36] Tuesday but it was the course of this
[1:13:40] week. So I just got up in the
[1:13:43] morning and then something came to my
[1:13:46] mind and I was thinking about
[1:13:49] Paul. Paul would go in a place stay
[1:13:52] there for two years
[1:13:55] preaching or one and a half years when
[1:13:58] you read the book of Acts. And now what
[1:14:00] came to my mind? But when Paul was in
[1:14:05] prison, how were those people he
[1:14:07] preached to
[1:14:09] surviving? You know, he was restrained
[1:14:11] from going anyway.
[1:14:13] remembered he would sometimes write
[1:14:16] letters but then he was
[1:14:18] held you know he was in one
[1:14:21] place and now it also came to my
[1:14:25] mind the whole of this year I've failed
[1:14:29] to go for missions far
[1:14:33] away to
[1:14:35] go you desire to go but you are not able
[1:14:38] to
[1:14:39] go and then you feel like you are bound
[1:14:43] you're not able to
[1:14:44] move. And I was
[1:14:47] thinking I would just say God help those
[1:14:50] people. And now when after some 3 four
[1:14:54] hours, I called a brother, a pastor who
[1:14:58] is in that side. Then I told him, I'm
[1:15:02] sorry I've not been able to
[1:15:03] come. Then I told him that story of
[1:15:06] Paul. Paul was bound.
[1:15:11] But those people who he had been
[1:15:12] preaching
[1:15:13] to, you had to have something to keep
[1:15:16] them. And I was telling him, you have
[1:15:19] the message books. You have the Bible.
[1:15:22] Get these message
[1:15:24] books. Read them before the church.
[1:15:27] Encourage these people to read them.
[1:15:30] Teach them using these books. I don't
[1:15:32] know when I'll come to encourage you.
[1:15:35] He told me
[1:15:37] there's a sister in our church
[1:15:40] who
[1:15:41] dreamt and what he
[1:15:43] dreamt she dreamed that we were going
[1:15:45] with those pastors in that
[1:15:48] place. We had gone to preach the gospel
[1:15:51] and when we went to preach the
[1:15:53] gospel she dreamed that I was put in
[1:15:58] prison and for them now they were free
[1:16:01] and then they were
[1:16:02] crying. Then I would tell them you keep
[1:16:05] on
[1:16:06] praying. Praise the name of But you see
[1:16:09] what I thought about in the
[1:16:13] morning. This one is telling me in a
[1:16:15] dream almost the
[1:16:17] same. Praise the name of the Lord. God
[1:16:21] showing here you are looking at a
[1:16:23] scripture
[1:16:24] thing relating it to the condition you
[1:16:27] are
[1:16:27] going. It's okay but God will take care
[1:16:30] and then somewhere God shows somebody
[1:16:32] there.
[1:16:34] that this is what is going on. Praise
[1:16:37] the name of our Lord. God works
[1:16:40] out. Praise the name of our Lord that
[1:16:43] you know the
[1:16:44] scriptures. They are
[1:16:46] anointed. They are
[1:16:49] inspired. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:16:51] They come to pass. Praise the name of
[1:16:54] Lord. So they are alive.
[1:16:57] So the Bible is telling
[1:16:59] us that we may be
[1:17:02] rooted and built up in
[1:17:05] Christ. Be rooted in the word of
[1:17:08] God. The word of God says love one
[1:17:12] another. See that you don't allow the
[1:17:14] spirit of
[1:17:17] hatred, hatred to come and take a hold
[1:17:20] of
[1:17:21] you. You reject the spirit of
[1:17:24] hatred. Regardless of what the person is
[1:17:26] saying against you, what they are
[1:17:30] hating, just put that spirit
[1:17:33] there. Praise the name of God. So the
[1:17:36] Bible says that we may be established in
[1:17:44] faith as we have been
[1:17:48] taught. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:17:51] us go to first Corinthians chapter
[1:17:53] 1. I saw our time is running
[1:17:59] out. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[1:18:02] says for discourse we also first first
[1:18:06] Colossians rather chapter 1 vers9
[1:18:10] Colossians
[1:18:12] Colossians chapter 1
[1:18:20] verse9 for this cause we also since the
[1:18:24] day we had it do not cease to pray for
[1:18:26] you and to desire that you might be
[1:18:29] filled with the knowledge of his will in
[1:18:31] all wisdom and spiritual understanding.
[1:18:53] that you might walk worthy of the Lord
[1:18:56] unto all pleasing, being fruitful in
[1:18:58] every good work and increasing in the
[1:19:01] knowledge of God.
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:24] strengthened with all might according to
[1:19:27] his glorious power and to all patience
[1:19:30] and longsuffering with joyfulness.
[1:19:49] Giving thanks unto the Father, which has
[1:19:51] made us meet to be partakers of the
[1:19:54] inheritance of the saints in light.
[1:20:04] who has delivered us from the power of
[1:20:06] darkness and has translated us into the
[1:20:08] kingdom of his dear
[1:20:17] son. In whom we have redemption through
[1:20:20] his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:28] Praise the name of our Lord. So you we
[1:20:31] have to be established in Christ.
[1:20:35] Praise the name of our Lord where you
[1:20:37] get yourself fully
[1:20:39] committed. you know, seeking the grace
[1:20:42] of
[1:20:43] God, the leadership of the Holy
[1:20:45] Spirit, and then the Bible says that you
[1:20:49] know, you have the knowledge of God's
[1:20:53] will, and then you are walking
[1:20:58] worthy, worthy of pleasing unto
[1:21:02] God, bearing, being fruitful in every
[1:21:06] good work.
[1:21:09] And then he says, "Then you are
[1:21:12] strengthened." Praise the name of Lord.
[1:21:15] Strong in the
[1:21:16] Lord. Not any small temptation that
[1:21:19] comes your
[1:21:21] fall. No, you are strong. Able to resist
[1:21:25] the temptation, able to resist the
[1:21:28] devil. So you are in the depth of
[1:21:31] God and you keep on
[1:21:34] growing more
[1:21:36] rooted more
[1:21:39] grounded. Praise the name of God. Now in
[1:21:43] the message the Ephesian church age. He
[1:21:46] says the very name
[1:21:49] Ephesus has a strange compound
[1:21:53] meaning aimed at
[1:21:59] and relaxed.
[1:22:02] The high aspiration of this
[1:22:09] age that he they had begun with the
[1:22:12] fullness of the
[1:22:14] spirit, the depth of
[1:22:17] God whereby they were aiming at the high
[1:22:20] calling of
[1:22:23] God began to give way to a less watchful
[1:22:27] attitude.
[1:22:33] A
[1:22:34] lessent following of
[1:22:42] Jesus began to be manifested in
[1:22:47] itself as an omen that in the future
[1:22:49] ages the physical vehicle called the
[1:22:52] church would sink to the awfulness of
[1:22:53] the depth of Satan.
[1:23:03] It had become relaxed and was
[1:23:09] drifting. Already the edge was
[1:23:13] backsliding. It had left its first
[1:23:17] love. The tiny seed planted in the
[1:23:20] vision
[1:23:22] age would now grow in the spirit of
[1:23:25] error.
[1:23:29] until all the falls of the air would
[1:23:32] roast its branches.
[1:23:42] So in offensive to the human
[1:23:51] reasoning, would that little plant
[1:23:54] appear to the new
[1:24:01] Eve, the new church, that again she
[1:24:05] would be deceived by Satan.
[1:24:09] the the Ephesian age had presented to
[1:24:13] her the opportunity for God's
[1:24:17] best and for a while she
[1:24:24] prevailed and then
[1:24:26] relaxed and in the unguarded
[1:24:30] moment Satan planted the seed of
[1:24:33] complete reation.
[1:24:40] Now that's how the devil tries to be in
[1:24:42] our
[1:24:43] lives. You stop reading your
[1:24:46] Bible. You stop
[1:24:48] praying. You stop meditating upon the
[1:24:50] word of
[1:24:52] God. You know you actually it's the
[1:24:54] devil ruining
[1:24:56] you. He's bringing you
[1:24:59] back. You even forgotten the beginning
[1:25:02] things.
[1:25:04] You know the Bible says because iniquity
[1:25:07] shall
[1:25:09] abound, the love of many shall
[1:25:11] works. So you find that even the clothes
[1:25:14] you're putting on, you don't
[1:25:17] care. But everybody is putting on
[1:25:21] the you go to the shop, you know, most
[1:25:24] of the
[1:25:25] shops, the clothes for especially women,
[1:25:30] they above the knees.
[1:25:34] Now all your colleagues dress like
[1:25:36] that. Why don't I also dress like
[1:25:39] that? Now maybe you move with in the
[1:25:43] bag when you there's a brother there
[1:25:50] sister. It starts like
[1:25:53] that. When you're coming to church, you
[1:25:56] have clothes for
[1:25:58] church. At place of work,
[1:26:02] sleeveless
[1:26:07] vest, but I'm at a place of work. It's
[1:26:10] not offending
[1:26:12] anybody. At place of work, the breasts
[1:26:15] are
[1:26:17] out. at place of
[1:26:19] work this point here of the
[1:26:23] west I also have to show
[1:26:30] something you know it's a
[1:26:33] spirit but at church I don't want to
[1:26:36] offend
[1:26:38] anybody how about the Holy
[1:26:42] Spirit you know those kind of
[1:26:45] spirits they just take a hold of
[1:26:48] you. If you have holes in your
[1:26:53] ear, you move with your pins. And
[1:26:57] what you're almost reaching work, then
[1:26:59] you put them
[1:27:00] on. I look now
[1:27:02] smart. When you know, you remove them,
[1:27:05] put them
[1:27:08] somewhere. Then you have those plastic
[1:27:11] nails.
[1:27:15] So you put them
[1:27:18] there when among the people you try to s
[1:27:20] you get rid
[1:27:23] of different things
[1:27:26] spirit because there's something which
[1:27:29] has taken a hold of
[1:27:31] you that has taken a hold of your
[1:27:34] heart. So you are now
[1:27:38] relaxed. You get relaxed.
[1:27:41] You can afford men to touch you any time
[1:27:51] spirit just taking a hold of
[1:27:56] you say you know you're not meant to be
[1:27:58] rough or
[1:28:01] rude. You know the devil just takes
[1:28:04] holding you slowly slowly slowly slowly
[1:28:08] like a
[1:28:09] python just taking a hold surrounding
[1:28:13] you surrounding you until now you get
[1:28:18] gone that's what the devil
[1:28:20] does now in this
[1:28:23] message church age
[1:28:26] yeah he says revelations 3:2
[1:28:31] be watchful ful and strengthen the
[1:28:34] things which remain that are ready to
[1:28:36] die.
[1:28:41] Be
[1:28:45] watchful and strengthen the things which
[1:28:51] remain ready to die. For I have not
[1:28:55] found thy works perfect before God.
[1:28:59] Then he says, I wish it could be said
[1:29:01] that the age.
[1:29:05] Okay, I think we shall jump that. Then
[1:29:08] he
[1:29:14] says, let me just get a place here
[1:29:16] ahead.
[1:29:21] He says this was the reformation
[1:29:26] period but the fear but fear not little
[1:29:32] frog. God said I will
[1:29:36] restore and this reform was going to
[1:29:39] start of
[1:29:42] it. He was going to, according to his
[1:29:46] promise, take the church
[1:29:49] back from the depths of Satan in the
[1:29:52] dark
[1:29:54] ages to the depths of
[1:29:57] God that they had at
[1:30:00] Pentecost in the first few years of the
[1:30:03] existence of the
[1:30:05] church. And that's how the Lord desires
[1:30:08] us. Let us get back into the depth of
[1:30:12] God.
[1:30:14] Praise the name of the Lord. Taking your
[1:30:16] time reading your
[1:30:17] Bible, taking time to meditate on the
[1:30:21] word, taking time praying and
[1:30:25] fasting, seeking the face of God. Lord,
[1:30:28] I desire more of
[1:30:30] you. Then you know even the life that
[1:30:32] you
[1:30:33] live being a witness of the things of
[1:30:36] God, you
[1:30:38] testify even at your place of work. If
[1:30:42] they are looking for a person who is
[1:30:44] safe, everybody knows you are
[1:30:47] safe. Even those who are
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:57] fake, they will
[1:31:01] know until after some years they will
[1:31:03] come and ask you, are you still
[1:31:07] saved? Praise the name.
[1:31:10] Are you still
[1:31:12] saved? There is a person who was
[1:31:14] studying with in secondary more than
[1:31:16] close to 30 years
[1:31:20] ago. Now she's in an
[1:31:26] organization with my
[1:31:28] wife. So now he was telling my
[1:31:32] wife that that one there from the time
[1:31:36] we're in
[1:31:41] school you know it's not something
[1:31:42] you've gotten to come
[1:31:45] out. So they have a
[1:31:47] testimony that there you are true and
[1:31:51] even after many years they are finding
[1:31:55] you. How are you
[1:31:58] standing? Praise the name of there's
[1:32:01] something real in your
[1:32:02] life that keeps you
[1:32:05] going and it doesn't grow
[1:32:08] old. Praise the name of it doesn't grow
[1:32:11] old. It is so fresh.

[1:32:29] you in this area. You're still alive.

[1:32:45] a death grave or is a
[1:32:52] graveyard but we went through and God
[1:32:54] gave us
[1:32:56] grace but now I don't know if if that
[1:32:58] time it was a
[1:33:01] graveyard. I don't know whether now it
[1:33:03] is hell. I don't
[1:33:06] know because people dress the way they
[1:33:10] want the way they
[1:33:12] want and then you go to one
[1:33:15] day you get university
[1:33:18] girls as

[1:33:56] immorality. That's what is happening.
[1:34:02] real
[1:34:05] immorality. That's what's happening. So,
[1:34:07] you need the spirit of
[1:34:09] God to watch over your life. And it's
[1:34:13] the spirit of God that will make the
[1:34:16] word of God
[1:34:19] alive. Praise the name of God. That the
[1:34:22] word of God is

[1:34:26] which are
[1:34:29] hard, you'll be alive.

[1:51:03] faith. Oh, when I lose my
[1:51:09] faith. Oh, when I lose hope.
[1:51:12] Oh, when I lose
[1:51:16] hope. When the tempter deceives. Oh,
[1:51:19] when the
[1:51:21] tempter deceives, his work is to kill,
[1:51:24] to steal and destroy. Oh, to steal and
[1:51:30] destroy. What do I do like blind
[1:51:33] Bimias? Oh, then I cry out,
[1:51:38] "Savior, please don't pass me.
[1:51:42] Please don't pass me
[1:51:45] by. Allow me to pour my oil, Lord. Oh,
[1:51:50] allow me to
[1:51:56] pour my oil at your
[1:52:01] feet. The next verse. When I'm confused.
[1:52:05] Oh, when I am
[1:52:08] confused and lost with all these things
[1:52:11] of the
[1:52:12] world and lost in this
[1:52:16] world. Oh my, when I hear the word, oh,
[1:52:21] when I hear the
[1:52:23] word, yes, sometimes I don't
[1:52:27] understand, but don't understand.
[1:52:32] Oh, even then,
[1:52:34] Savior. Oh, even then,
[1:52:40] Savior. I
[1:52:42] know I still believe the
[1:52:47] word. Just teach me to pour my oil. Oh,
[1:52:51] teach me to
[1:52:57] go my oil at your feet. Come on, sing
[1:53:02] with me. I'm coming to touch the hem of
[1:53:05] his garment. I'm coming to touch. Is it
[1:53:10] what you're going to do
[1:53:12] tonight? Oh, the h of his
[1:53:17] government. There's no way to turn. Oh,
[1:53:21] there's nohere to turn. I forsaken the
[1:53:26] old things. I'm not looking back.
[1:53:29] I'm not looking
[1:53:32] back. Oh, like blind
[1:53:35] bimas. Oh, I'm crying.
[1:53:41] Savior. Oh,
[1:53:44] please don't pass me by. Don't pass me
[1:53:49] by, Lord, this afternoon.
[1:53:51] Oh, I'm coming to
[1:53:59] pour my oil at your
[1:54:07] feet. If you'd give me
[1:54:10] air. For the life of the flesh is in the
[1:54:15] blood. I've given it to you upon the
[1:54:18] altar.
[1:54:20] Amen. If you can stand up.
[1:54:24] When sin came and could not worship
[1:54:30] without the
[1:54:32] [Music]
[1:54:33] blood, God came to
[1:54:37] fellowship with man. He found him
[1:54:42] known for he called Adam.
[1:54:48] Adam, where are you? I'm hidden. Could
[1:54:53] not bear God's presence without the
[1:55:00] blood. Eating from the tree.
[1:55:03] Oh, eating from the tree of knowledge.
[1:55:09] Good and evil.
[1:55:14] In a state of
[1:55:17] nakedness, man had fig leaves covered
[1:55:21] her. A blood sacrifice. A blood
[1:55:26] sacrifice of goats and skins God made to
[1:55:31] clothe them. Restoring life and
[1:55:36] fellowship with man again. Oh, the
[1:55:41] life for the
[1:55:44] life of the flesh is in the blood. I've
[1:55:50] given it to you upon the altar. I have
[1:55:54] given it to you upon the It's the blood
[1:56:00] that makes atonement.
[1:56:03] It's the blood that makes
[1:56:07] atonement for my soul and makes me
[1:56:11] fellowship with God once again. Makes me
[1:56:16] fellowship with God once. Just one more
[1:56:20] time. For the
[1:56:23] life, for the
[1:56:25] life, all the flesh is in the blood.
[1:56:30] I've given it to you upon the altar. I
[1:56:34] have given it to you upon the
[1:56:40] altar. Oh, it's the blood. It's the
[1:56:44] blood that makes
[1:56:48] atonement for my
[1:56:52] soul and makes me
[1:56:55] fellowship with God.
[1:57:02] Oh my
[1:57:09] [Applause]
[1:57:14] Jesus high.

[1:57:50] Christ. We also want to thank you,
[1:57:53] Father, the body of Jesus
[1:57:55] Christ. We are the body of
[1:57:58] Christ and members in particular.
[1:58:02] We want to thank you,
[1:58:03] Lord, that by your blood you've made us
[1:58:07] to be part of
[1:58:09] you. How you instructed us in your
[1:58:12] word that we should do this in
[1:58:14] remembrance of
[1:58:16] you, taking of your
[1:58:20] bread, which is the body of
[1:58:22] Christ, representing the word of
[1:58:25] God, which has been for kind of
[1:58:28] represented by the unleavened bread.
[1:58:32] And then also taking of the blood of
[1:58:34] Christ which is represented by the
[1:58:37] wine and then food washing. You
[1:58:41] instructed us to fulfill these
[1:58:43] things. Father as we start this
[1:58:46] service we pray you may be with us
[1:58:49] again. Bless us father as we fulfill
[1:58:53] your word. We pray in the name of Jesus
[1:58:56] Christ there be any weak amongst us. May
[1:59:00] you Lord touch them. May you Lord heal
[1:59:03] them. May you Lord make them whole and
[1:59:06] bless us together in this
[1:59:08] service. Remember also our brothers and
[1:59:11] sisters were not able to be here because
[1:59:13] of one reason or another.
[1:59:15] Pray that your grace may reach unto
[1:59:18] them and strengthen them father and our
[1:59:21] preeminence lord. I preside over this
[1:59:25] father what we are going to do guiding

[1:59:41] scriptures. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:46] We always pick it from the book of 1
[1:59:48] Corinthians chapter 11
[1:59:53] and then verse 23
[1:59:57] up to verse
[2:00:01] 26. For I have received of the Lord that
[2:00:04] which also I delivered unto you, that
[2:00:07] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[2:00:09] he was betrayed took bread,
[2:00:25] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[2:00:28] it and said, "Take it. This is my body
[2:00:31] which is broken for you. Do in
[2:00:34] remembrance of me.
[2:00:45] After the same manner also he took the
[2:00:48] cup when he had sapped, saying, "This
[2:00:50] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[2:00:54] This do as you often drink of it in
[2:00:57] remembrance of me.
[2:01:12] For as oft as you eat this bread and
[2:01:14] drink this cup, you do show the Lord's
[2:01:17] death till he
[2:01:20] [Music]
[2:01:27] come. Amen. Amen. Let us bless the
[2:01:30] bread.
[2:01:33] Father in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[2:01:36] pray that you may sanctify this
[2:01:37] unleavened
[2:01:39] bread that Lord may be able to serve the
[2:01:43] purpose representing the body of Jesus
[2:01:46] Christ of which we are the body in
[2:01:49] particular and as we partake of it, we
[2:01:53] are
[2:01:53] testifying that we are the body of
[2:01:56] Christ. We pray may bless us
[2:01:59] therefore in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:02:01] Christ. We pray
[2:02:03] Amen. You may be seated.
