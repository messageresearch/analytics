[25:06] this morning.
[25:16] We give thanks and honor to your holy
[25:18] name
[25:20] to know today
[25:23] that we are one of those that you have
[25:26] chosen.
[25:28] We want to have faith in what you have
[25:30] done.
[25:33] And we want to come before your presence
[25:37] knowing that the blood shall never lose
[25:40] its power
[25:43] to cleanse
[25:45] and to perfect.
[25:48] Bless your people in the service today.
[25:52] Whatsoever your children have need of
[25:57] my
[26:10] [Music]
[28:15] And we are going to dedicate this little
[28:18] gent.
[28:21] into the hands of the master
[28:24] that the master may watch over him
[28:28] and give him sound health
[28:32] and protect him from the spirits of the
[28:34] age.
[28:37] Let's pray. Precious heavenly father,
[28:42] we humbly come to you this morning,
[28:47] bringing little gems into your hands.
[28:51] Father, I dedicate him
[28:55] to the protection of the master.
[28:59] He was born into a world that is evil
[29:01] and wicked.
[29:05] But yet the light of the Holy Spirit
[29:09] lives in the midst of this darkness
[29:13] to protect little ones like this one
[29:17] that are dedicated to you.
[29:20] Father, I pray that you may protect him.
[29:25] Put a ring of fire around him
[29:28] that the enemy may not stretch his hand
[29:30] to touch.
[29:33] We pray that you may deliver him
[29:36] from all the attacks of the enemy
[29:40] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:43] that he may enjoy good health.
[29:46] I also rebuke
[29:49] the condition that the enemy subjects to
[29:51] him
[29:53] in the name of Jesus. I rebuke those
[29:56] spirits.
[29:58] Father, I call healing upon him
[30:02] as I dedicate him today in the name of
[30:05] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[30:10] [Applause]
[30:12] That's right.
[30:14] So this is little heart right.
[30:18] We are going to dedicate her to the
[30:20] Lord.
[30:22] Precious heavenly father
[30:25] in the name of the lord Jesus Christ
[30:28] I am bringing right before thee
[30:32] was a woman of faith.
[30:36] She said the right thing
[30:39] and the creative power
[30:42] to bring the new birth
[30:45] came down to her two boys.
[30:48] I pray heavenly father that the same
[30:51] power may always encircle around this
[30:55] little heart ride
[30:58] that you may watch over her that when
[31:01] she comes to her age of responsibility
[31:05] that she may walk into your arms,
[31:08] confess her sins, Lord, and that you may
[31:12] save her to the glory of your name. I
[31:16] dedicate our father for total protection
[31:19] from above
[31:22] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[31:28] [Applause]
[31:35] Praise the Lord.
[31:37] So I want to remind you
[31:42] that church opens at 9:00.
[31:48] and then you come down here,
[31:51] dedicate yourself for the service.
[31:55] Amen. Amen. So, the pastor has given me
[31:58] the opportunity
[32:02] to speak to you this morning.
[32:08] [Applause]
[32:11] The word is the living word.
[32:15] Amen. Amen. It has got its power
[32:18] to transform,
[32:20] to heal, to deliver, to do all that the
[32:24] word promised to do.
[32:29] Amen. Amen. So, you just need to stand
[32:31] in faith.
[32:33] And I want you to look at the days that
[32:35] we are living in.
[32:39] We are living in the end time
[32:42] and we don't have much time to go.
[32:46] And I want to tell you one thing
[32:49] that the church is horning out.
[32:55] Amen. Amen. Because honing is
[33:04] amen. And this is the hour which we are
[33:06] living in.
[33:09] So you remember Michelangelo
[33:13] when he got that wall block.
[33:20] But out of that block,
[33:23] he had a revelation
[33:25] that he had the ability to make Moses
[33:27] out of it
[33:31] because he had seen a vision of what
[33:33] Moses was.
[33:37] And so what he did, he started horning
[33:40] out
[33:42] everything that hid the image of Moses
[33:48] and he horned it out
[33:50] until he was able to bring forth the
[33:52] image of Moses.
[33:55] So the horning of the ch
[33:58] is God cutting off the parts of the
[34:01] body.
[34:04] I mean parts of the I mean the block
[34:08] that hide the image of Christ.
[34:12] Are you together with me? So horning is
[34:15] the part of the church.
[34:18] Amen. That you know horning is cutting
[34:21] off the part of the church.
[34:26] that's not, you know, in continuation
[34:29] with the word
[34:32] and he does it in a certain way.
[34:36] He allows circumstances along the
[34:38] journey
[34:41] and when people stumble those
[34:43] circumstances
[34:46] and they fall away, sometimes you cry,
[34:51] but it's God dealing with this church.
[34:55] Amen. He upgrades the understanding of
[34:58] the word
[35:01] by revelation sometimes
[35:04] and then the people who will not really
[35:07] be able to understand
[35:10] some of them still follow.
[35:13] Amen. And you keep crying but God knows
[35:17] what he's doing.
[35:20] Amen. Because he went and said, you
[35:23] know, drink of my blood and eat of my
[35:25] flesh.
[35:29] And then the servant
[35:33] were not able to understand what he
[35:35] meant
[35:37] and they fell away
[35:39] because of the teaching of the word.
[35:42] So they did not wait
[35:45] to know what he meant.
[35:48] So they fell away.
[35:50] Amen. Amen. But I want us to hold it
[35:53] together
[35:55] as the word keeps coming into great
[35:57] understanding.
[36:00] And God has given us a pastor
[36:04] who is very competent with the word.
[36:07] We should have confidence in him
[36:11] and to the pace as the Holy Spirit
[36:14] guides you.
[36:17] Amen. Praise the Lord. We should do the
[36:20] best
[36:22] support the pastor and be part of the
[36:25] church and always thank God.
[36:29] This is the best place God chose for
[36:31] you.
[36:33] There cannot be a better place for you
[36:36] and you always thank God. When God gives
[36:39] you a pastor,
[36:41] that's the best you can ever find.
[36:45] So you pray for him. be present whenever
[36:48] he's here to preach.
[36:51] Be part of the service.
[36:53] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Yes, sir.
[36:57] We certainly appreciate God.
[37:00] And uh I just don't know where to begin
[37:03] from,
[37:06] but uh I want to kind of follow up with
[37:10] uh what he preached about two weeks ago.
[37:19] There is a prophet in the land.
[37:22] Amen. Amen. So I want to pick that up
[37:26] and just go along as the spirit helps
[37:29] us.
[37:32] So I'm requesting for a special song
[37:34] down here
[37:37] that the young people may bless us.
[37:42] Amen. Amen.
[37:46] Are you ready?

[43:36] They could not call
[43:40] the passion last seen
[43:46] [Music]
[43:49] house
[43:50] [Music]
[43:51] had left.
[43:58] When Jesus came,
[44:02] how will Jesus
[44:06] [Music]
[44:08] come? When Jesus comes,
[44:13] the temp
[44:16] [Music]
[44:17] Jesus comes. In Jesus love
[44:24] that he has

[44:56] and f the life with glory.
[45:03] For holy shame
[45:07] when Jesus
[45:09] comes to stay.
[45:17] Praise the Lord.
[45:20] Amen.
[45:21] The leper cried in torment.
[45:27] Amen. Amen.
[45:30] Sister is around.
[45:36] She's just jambling.
[45:38] Praise the Lord. Do you love him? Say
[45:42] amen, somebody.
[45:45] Amen. Amen. I'm a friend to noise.
[45:49] I'm a friend to noise.
[45:53] So when you hear the word,
[45:56] make me know you've heard the word.
[45:59] Amen. Amen. So let's stand up and get
[46:02] into the scripture reading.
[46:05] I'm praying that the Lord may bless this
[46:07] service
[46:10] to encourage us to walk this journey.
[46:14] There's no reason why we give up.
[46:18] We have gone so far
[46:21] to look back.
[46:23] Amen. Amen. If there is any situation,
[46:28] put it under the blood.
[46:30] Keep walking.
[46:32] Keep walking. Tell your friend and walk
[46:35] this journey
[46:37] and get to the end of it.
[46:40] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[46:43] Second Kings
[46:45] 5 and verse 4.
[46:56] Now this is a situation
[47:01] that in the kingdom of Syria
[47:06] there was one of the generals.
[47:10] He was a leopard.
[47:13] He didn't like the situation
[47:17] and then he tried many times
[47:23] to get well from his leprosy
[47:27] but it was not possible.
[47:31] So there is a girl
[47:34] like the pastor was teaching about being
[47:36] a witness.
[47:40] She says there is a prophet
[47:42] in our land. She was a captive.
[47:47] She was a slave.
[47:49] Amen. In Syria, she was working for some
[47:53] people.
[47:55] And then she says, "Go and tell the
[47:56] general
[47:58] that there is a prophet in the land of
[48:00] Israel."
[48:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We thank God
[48:05] that we have had a prophet in our
[48:07] generation.
[48:09] Amen. Amen. So she went, you know, gave
[48:12] the information
[48:15] and the information reached the general.
[48:19] And the general went to the king of
[48:21] Syria
[48:23] and says that I understand
[48:26] in Israel, I can be healed of my lepros.
[48:32] So verse four,
[48:34] and one went in and told his lord,
[48:37] saying,
[48:41] Thus th said the maid that is of the
[48:45] land of Israel.
[48:50] And the king of Syria said,
[48:53] "Go,
[48:55] and I will send a letter unto the king
[48:57] of Israel."
[49:00] And he departed
[49:02] and took with him 10 talents of silver
[49:07] and 6,000 pieces of gold
[49:11] and 10 changes of remnant.
[49:18] May the Lord had blessing the reading of
[49:20] his word.
[49:21] You may be seated.
[49:23] You see the Syrians
[49:26] had a mentality
[49:29] that divine gifts must be paid for
[49:34] and that's what happens in some of these
[49:36] organizations
[49:39] that they tend to pay for divine gifts.
[49:47] So the king of Syria then
[49:49] he decided to send a message carrying a
[49:52] letter to the king of Israel
[49:56] saying that this letter here
[49:59] sent to you
[50:01] introducing a man
[50:04] who a general in my army.
[50:07] He's a leopard
[50:09] and I understand in Israel he could be
[50:13] healed.
[50:16] But when the king read the letter,
[50:19] he tore his clothes
[50:22] and he was lamenting
[50:24] who told these people
[50:27] that I, the king of Israel,
[50:30] is a God that can heal lepros.
[50:35] This man wants a quarrel with me
[50:38] and again he wants a war with me.
[50:42] But when the prophet in the land
[50:45] heard about the panic of the king,
[50:49] he said there is no need for the king to
[50:52] panic.
[50:54] Let them send that leper to me
[50:58] so that they may know there is a prophet
[51:01] in the land. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So
[51:04] today I want to speak on the subject.
[51:09] There is a prophet in the land
[51:12] where things are impossible.
[51:15] God has given us a prophet in the land
[51:19] and that prophet is not dead
[51:23] because the message is in the tapes
[51:27] is in the books. Whatever we need, we
[51:31] can have it. We thank God today for the
[51:35] message of the hour. We've brought a
[51:37] prophet in the land.
[51:40] Amen. Praise the Lord. So then came with
[51:45] his horses and with his chariot and
[51:49] stood at the door of Elisha.
[51:52] So this is a story of a man in a very
[51:56] high position in government
[52:01] but he was under torment
[52:05] for a situation that he did not like.
[52:09] He was a leper and leprosy is a curable
[52:13] disease
[52:16] but it causes skin license and nerve
[52:18] damage.
[52:22] Amen. You see patches of different
[52:24] color.
[52:27] Amen. And it goes to the nerve center
[52:32] and it tries to destroy the nerves.
[52:38] What is the
[52:48] so that when you touch here
[52:51] The does not talk to your brain.
[52:57] So you are not aware.
[53:00] You can step on fire and it keeps
[53:03] burning you. But because you are a
[53:06] leper, you may not know.
[53:11] It's a very bad situation.
[53:13] It affects the fingers and the toes
[53:18] with wounds.
[53:20] And these wounds normally get into the
[53:23] joints.
[53:26] And the purpose of these wounds
[53:29] is to break this part away from the
[53:32] body.
[53:34] So you find some of these lepers,
[53:37] they've got some of their toes and
[53:40] fingers.
[53:42] It is totally broken off.
[53:45] Amen. So it disintegrates the body.
[53:50] Amen. So in Israel, the man who was
[53:54] suspected to be a leper
[53:57] was always examined by a spiritual
[54:00] office.
[54:04] Amen. It is a priest who are to examine
[54:08] a man.
[54:11] And when that man was found to be a
[54:13] leper,
[54:16] then he was made aware
[54:19] that let me tell you that you've got
[54:22] leprosy
[54:24] and leprosy does not allow you
[54:28] to be a part of the fellowship of
[54:31] Israel.
[54:33] Are you together with me? So leprosy
[54:37] just cut them off.
[54:40] That's what lepros does to the body.
[54:43] And then if a man thought he was healed,
[54:48] the man still to go back
[54:52] and examined by a spiritual office
[54:56] and the spiritual office
[54:59] which was a priest would let him know
[55:03] you were not healed yet.
[55:06] And if he was healed, then the spiritual
[55:09] office
[55:11] healed
[55:13] and now integrating him back into
[55:15] fellowship.
[55:18] Amen. Now I want to kind of cause you to
[55:21] think,
[55:24] how should a I mean a sinkiness
[55:27] be connected to a spiritual office?
[55:32] It's not a doctor examining you.
[55:36] But it's a priest
[55:38] is the one examining you. Amen. So how
[55:42] could leprosy be connected with the
[55:44] spiritual faith?
[55:47] At least a leprosy
[55:50] had a spiritual significance.
[55:54] Are you together with me? So in the case
[55:57] of non
[56:00] who was a gentile,
[56:02] they didn't have priests out there.
[56:05] to declare them priest I mean leprosy
[56:09] or to tell them you are healed from
[56:11] leprosy.
[56:13] So another spiritual office.
[56:17] Amen. Another spiritual office.
[56:20] Amen. Higher than that of a priest
[56:25] was involved.
[56:28] Amen. And the healing of n.
[56:32] Now I want us to know that this had a
[56:36] spiritual significance.
[56:39] Amen. Because Hebrews 10
[56:43] verse I mean verse one
[56:46] says that the old testament
[56:49] is a shadow of the good things to come.
[56:53] So whatever was done in the Old
[56:55] Testament
[56:57] had a spiritual significance
[57:00] that could be interpreted out here in
[57:03] the New Testament.
[57:06] So now there were several shadows for
[57:08] example
[57:11] in the Old Testament that we could refer
[57:14] to as parables
[57:17] of what was coming forth in the New
[57:20] Testament.
[57:23] Are you together with me? So like the
[57:26] sacrifice of the lamb
[57:29] in the Passover feast religion,
[57:32] it was a parable.
[57:35] It was a type.
[57:39] Amen. Talking about Christ coming
[57:43] as the lamb of God
[57:46] to take away the sins of the people.
[57:49] Okay. For all these things of the Old
[57:52] Testament
[57:54] were shadow
[57:56] and tied
[57:58] and sign
[58:01] posts
[58:03] that we could look at as our examples.
[58:08] Amen. Amen. So there are no irrelevant
[58:11] records in the Bible.
[58:17] Are you together with me? There is
[58:19] nothing that's irrelevant in the Bible
[58:23] because the Bible is the word of God.
[58:27] So the Old Testament
[58:30] is a natural church
[58:32] and with the spiritual church, we could
[58:36] resource out of the Old Testament
[58:38] examples
[58:42] understand our positions in the New
[58:44] Testament.
[58:47] So over here in the New Testament,
[58:50] therefore lepros speaks of the life of
[58:52] sin.
[58:55] Are you together with me? Sin is a
[58:58] rejection of divine instructions.
[59:02] Amen. And once you reject divine
[59:05] instruction,
[59:07] then you slide into the condition
[59:11] of sin.
[59:16] Are you together with me? So sin is a
[59:20] rejection of divine instructions
[59:24] from the word and this condition
[59:28] gives birth to sin.
[59:31] Uh-uh.
[59:38] So sin
[59:40] is a natureh. Sin
[59:44] is a nature.
[59:46] But sins
[59:49] is the fruit of that nature.
[59:53] Are you together with me? So if this
[59:56] nature does not die,
[1:00:00] one continues to commit sins
[1:00:05] due to the nature.
[1:00:07] Amen. Amen. But Paul gave us a solution.
[1:00:13] He said I
[1:00:16] die daily.
[1:00:19] Every day he woke up.
[1:00:22] He had to remember. He had to die.
[1:00:26] because the nature of sin
[1:00:29] is so stable.
[1:00:32] I want to tell you something here. I'll
[1:00:35] take you in 1 Corinthians chapter 15
[1:00:39] and verse 31.
[1:00:42] The nature of sin
[1:00:45] causes a man to commit sin.
[1:00:49] And because of sin,
[1:00:52] therefore we can commit sins.
[1:00:56] Are you together with me? Okay. So in
[1:00:59] first Corinthians
[1:01:02] 15:31,
[1:01:04] he says, I protest by your rejoicing
[1:01:07] which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. I
[1:01:11] die daily.
[1:01:26] Praise the Lord. Paul is saying that I
[1:01:29] die daily.
[1:01:32] Why is anology?
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:38] Because a dead man
[1:01:41] does not commit sin.
[1:01:43] Are you together with me? When you give
[1:01:46] him a cigarette,
[1:01:48] he cannot smoke it. When you give him
[1:01:51] alcohol,
[1:01:52] he cannot drink it. So Paul is taking a
[1:01:57] negative
[1:02:01] to describe a positive.
[1:02:05] Are you together with me? Because
[1:02:07] literally death is negative.
[1:02:13] So in this actual situation,
[1:02:17] Paul chooses to use the negative analogy
[1:02:23] of a dead man
[1:02:25] to show how
[1:02:27] we can escape from sin.
[1:02:31] He says, I die daily.
[1:02:34] This is a very interesting analogy
[1:02:38] where the negative becomes positive.
[1:02:42] Amen. How many people like to die here?
[1:02:46] Nobody wants to die. Everybody wants
[1:02:49] tomorrow.
[1:02:51] But here in this situation, Paul says,
[1:02:53] "I die
[1:02:56] because he can be able to use the
[1:03:00] example of death
[1:03:02] to explain how you can be free from sin
[1:03:07] on the constant.
[1:03:12] Amen. Amen. Because when a dead man is
[1:03:15] dead,
[1:03:17] you cannot hurt him.
[1:03:21] When you speak against him,
[1:03:25] you cannot hurt him. But when a man is
[1:03:28] living and you say certain things
[1:03:31] against him, he's going to be hurt. And
[1:03:35] many times, I know some of you are hurt.
[1:03:39] because you hear certain things against
[1:03:41] you,
[1:03:43] you are still living. But if you are a
[1:03:46] dead man, even if they said you are a
[1:03:49] witch,
[1:03:51] it won't hurt you. If they say that man
[1:03:54] was just a stupid fellow,
[1:03:58] it doesn't hurt a dead man.
[1:04:01] Paul uses
[1:04:03] the knowledge of a dead man
[1:04:07] to explain how
[1:04:10] we can be able to avoid sin on a daily
[1:04:12] basis.
[1:04:15] Amen. Amen. So this is very interesting.
[1:04:19] Amen. Because to live is what should be
[1:04:22] positive.
[1:04:25] To live is what could be positive.
[1:04:30] But in depriving the flesh,
[1:04:36] dying
[1:04:38] is the positive.
[1:04:41] Amen. Amen. It is putting the active
[1:04:44] members of your body
[1:04:48] towards sin
[1:04:51] into a continuing stop.
[1:04:56] Amen. You wake up, I'm dead.
[1:05:00] I'm dead. I'm dead. So death certainly
[1:05:05] is a painful process
[1:05:08] that one must exercise or endure on a
[1:05:12] daily basis.
[1:05:17] Are you together with me? Yeah. To die
[1:05:20] is painful
[1:05:22] and I know that it cannot be enjoyable.
[1:05:27] But when you die then you are not
[1:05:31] conscious.
[1:05:34] Go through the pain every morning.
[1:05:38] I'm crucified with Christ.
[1:05:41] Nevertheless, I live
[1:05:43] but not I but Christ liveth in me. So
[1:05:47] once the members of your body yield to
[1:05:50] sin,
[1:05:53] Paul says, then the members of your body
[1:05:57] are alive.
[1:06:01] Let's go to Romans 6.
[1:06:03] We want to talk about a prophet in the
[1:06:05] land.
[1:06:08] Amen. Amen. Romans 6:6.
[1:06:12] Knowing this,
[1:06:15] that our old man is crucified with him,
[1:06:19] that the body of sin might be destroyed,
[1:06:23] that henceforth we should not serve sin.
[1:06:39] So you put death
[1:06:42] to your old man
[1:06:46] that used to live
[1:06:49] in sin
[1:06:51] so that sin
[1:06:53] may not have dominion over you.
[1:06:58] When a cigarette comes,
[1:07:00] you say, "My fingers died."
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:06] Because those are the members of your
[1:07:08] body.
[1:07:09] This old man,
[1:07:12] this one here
[1:07:14] is the nature of sin
[1:07:18] that we inherited from the first man,
[1:07:20] Adam.
[1:07:23] But the new man is the nature of Christ.
[1:07:29] that comes. Amen. At the new birth
[1:07:34] on the inside. Now I want you to know
[1:07:39] that you are three. You are a triune
[1:07:42] being,
[1:07:44] your flesh. Amen. Your spirit and then
[1:07:49] your soul.
[1:07:51] And in the soul
[1:07:53] there is a seed gene
[1:07:57] that can only live.
[1:08:00] When these members are dead,
[1:08:03] the flesh is dead. No human spirit, no
[1:08:08] natural judgments,
[1:08:10] no mental faculties,
[1:08:13] totally dead.
[1:08:15] The Holy Spirit
[1:08:18] will go and unite himself
[1:08:20] with your seed gene on the inside.
[1:08:24] And because you are alive on the inside,
[1:08:28] then the members of your body die.
[1:08:35] Praise the Lord. Amen. Look at Ephesians
[1:08:38] 4:22.
[1:08:41] trying to build this
[1:08:44] by the grace of God. Ephesians 4:22,
[1:08:49] he says that he put off concerning the
[1:08:52] former conversation the old man
[1:08:57] which is corrupt according to the deceit
[1:09:00] to the deceitfulness
[1:09:02] I mean to the de deceitful lusts.
[1:09:16] So this natural man,
[1:09:20] are you together with me? The natural
[1:09:23] man
[1:09:25] is your body
[1:09:28] and your human spirit.
[1:09:30] They constitute,
[1:09:33] the natural man.
[1:09:38] Are you together with me? So the old man
[1:09:42] is corrupt
[1:09:46] and will continually lean towards the
[1:09:49] deceitfulness of sin.
[1:09:55] But when we put off the old man
[1:10:00] by the new birth,
[1:10:03] then we constantly renew our mind.
[1:10:08] Amen. We constantly renew our mind
[1:10:13] because the new man feeds on the world.
[1:10:17] And as you feed on the word, the effect
[1:10:22] of the old man
[1:10:26] keeps dying.
[1:10:30] Praise the Lord. You feed on the word,
[1:10:33] certain things die away.
[1:10:36] certain things die away. And that's why
[1:10:39] Paul says, "I die daily and I feed on
[1:10:44] the word."
[1:10:49] Do you love him? Yes. Verse 23,
[1:10:54] that's Ephesians 4:23.
[1:10:57] He says, "And be renewed
[1:11:00] in the spirit of your mind,
[1:11:07] that he put on a new man,
[1:11:14] which after God
[1:11:18] is created in righteousness and true
[1:11:21] holiness.
[1:11:27] Meaning that this new man
[1:11:30] is a new creation,
[1:11:34] a creation
[1:11:36] by the spoken word.
[1:11:39] Are you together with me? So the word
[1:11:43] which you read every day, which you
[1:11:45] listen to every day, keeps you in a new
[1:11:49] man status
[1:11:55] as you feed on the word.
[1:11:57] You are recreating yourself
[1:12:01] by the word. So the first birth
[1:12:05] is your old man.
[1:12:08] But the new birth
[1:12:10] is the new man that responds
[1:12:14] to the demands of the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:18] And Paul says created in righteousness.
[1:12:23] Is it your righteousness?
[1:12:25] But you respond
[1:12:27] to the righteousness of God
[1:12:30] which is hidden in the word. As you read
[1:12:33] the word, you sent me to the word. Amen.
[1:12:38] I'm telling you, you are recreating
[1:12:40] yourself
[1:12:43] in righteousness.
[1:12:45] So this man, Amen, the new man, he
[1:12:49] rejoices
[1:12:51] in studying the word.
[1:12:54] Is that amen?
[1:12:55] He rejoices
[1:12:57] in meditating on the word.
[1:13:00] He rejoices in a life of prayer.
[1:13:04] His life pulls towards fellowship.
[1:13:10] We in the sense
[1:13:12] that new man cannot pull away from
[1:13:15] fellowship.
[1:13:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because he's not
[1:13:19] a leper.
[1:13:21] Amen. is leprosy which breaks away from
[1:13:24] the body.
[1:13:29] Praise the Lord. So this new man loves
[1:13:33] the brotherhood
[1:13:35] and will produce the nature
[1:13:38] of the parent
[1:13:41] because it's being created
[1:13:44] in the image of righteousness.
[1:13:47] He will produce love.
[1:13:50] He love his brother. He produce joy.
[1:13:54] He'll never be gloomy.
[1:13:56] He produce peace. He produce
[1:13:59] longsuffering.
[1:14:01] And then he will produce
[1:14:03] the fruit of the spirit that has formed
[1:14:07] him into a new creation.
[1:14:12] Amen. And Paul says against such
[1:14:18] there is no law.
[1:14:20] There is no law that can reform you.
[1:14:24] I can come with a thousand laws.
[1:14:28] It takes the spirit himself
[1:14:31] to recreate the inner man
[1:14:34] so that he can take control of the outer
[1:14:36] man.
[1:14:40] It is the lived life of Christ
[1:14:44] on the inside
[1:14:46] beginning to bear fruit.
[1:14:49] So the allegiance of your mind
[1:14:54] changes from the natural mind
[1:14:57] where we think like the rest of the
[1:14:59] people
[1:15:01] to thinking the thoughts of God.
[1:15:07] The thoughts of God
[1:15:10] are not positive and they are not
[1:15:12] negative.
[1:15:14] The thoughts of God are positive.
[1:15:18] The thoughts of God
[1:15:20] cannot imagine me hating a brother.
[1:15:25] So it cannot pass through my mind.
[1:15:28] The thoughts of God cannot come to my
[1:15:32] mind
[1:15:33] to adise me to stay away from church.
[1:15:37] No, that's not the mind of God.
[1:15:41] Let us develop the mind of God.
[1:15:45] Are you together with me? And live by
[1:15:48] the mind of God.
[1:15:50] Every morning you say, "I'm dying away
[1:15:53] from this. I'm dying away from that."
[1:15:57] Because you know who you are. You know
[1:15:59] the attitudes you have. You know the
[1:16:02] trouble that runs through your mind.
[1:16:06] Be like a Pope. I
[1:16:12] Amen. Amen. So looking at the origin of
[1:16:15] sin.
[1:16:17] Amen. Now let's go to Revelation 12
[1:16:22] because we've seen
[1:16:25] that we've seen that leprosy in the New
[1:16:29] Testament speaks about a nature of sin.
[1:16:37] So Revelation 12
[1:16:40] and verse 7
[1:16:42] it says
[1:16:44] And there was war in heaven.
[1:16:49] War is negative.
[1:16:52] And it had never been there before.
[1:16:55] There had never been a sinner before.
[1:16:59] But then that's where sin is beginning
[1:17:02] from.
[1:17:05] A type of leprosy.
[1:17:08] And what it does is to detach men from
[1:17:13] God.
[1:17:15] And there was war in heaven.
[1:17:19] There was lepros and now
[1:17:22] the origin of sin
[1:17:25] and eating away the joints of the angels
[1:17:33] until two/3s were cut off.
[1:17:37] That's what leprosy does.
[1:17:43] You see, and there was war in heaven.
[1:17:47] Michael and his angels
[1:17:51] fought against the dragon
[1:17:55] and the dragon fought and his angels.
[1:18:01] So what exactly was seen in heaven?
[1:18:07] There was no smoking.
[1:18:10] There was no drugs.
[1:18:12] There was no alcohol. But sin is
[1:18:16] rejection
[1:18:17] of the divine order.
[1:18:21] Once the divine order is rejected,
[1:18:26] then the fruits of sin
[1:18:28] begin to come forth. Then you can lie.
[1:18:32] Oh, I didn't come to church because
[1:18:36] and you are lying. That means you've
[1:18:39] rejected the divine order
[1:18:42] and the fruit of rejection
[1:18:46] begins to come forth.
[1:18:50] So the war was a rejection of the divine
[1:18:54] order of the world
[1:19:00] and it causes the human spirit
[1:19:03] to live in a free moral ages
[1:19:08] without a thinking man's field
[1:19:11] without the instructions of God.
[1:19:14] Anything that comes in such a man's
[1:19:17] mind,
[1:19:19] he just does what he thinks is right in
[1:19:22] his heart.
[1:19:26] Are you together with me? So where is
[1:19:29] the driving force of man?
[1:19:33] Because man is a triune being.
[1:19:38] There is the body. This body here is a
[1:19:42] servant.
[1:19:45] is just a servant.
[1:19:48] Then there is the driving force
[1:19:53] which is the human spirit.
[1:19:56] This is where your imaginations are.
[1:20:00] This is where your conscious is.
[1:20:04] This is where your memories are.
[1:20:07] This is where your reasons are.
[1:20:10] This is where your affections are.
[1:20:14] This is where you live.
[1:20:17] That's where your home is.
[1:20:23] Amen. And the human spirit and this body
[1:20:27] here is just a serpent.
[1:20:32] So when your human spirit is negative,
[1:20:37] this body here will display what is on
[1:20:40] your human spirit.
[1:20:46] You cannot tell me brother
[1:20:48] I love you so much until I cannot even
[1:20:52] say God bless you.
[1:20:57] Your body is a servant.
[1:21:00] I love God so much that I cannot go to
[1:21:04] church.
[1:21:07] A servant.
[1:21:08] You are portray on the east side.
[1:21:14] Are you together with me? So this is
[1:21:17] where sin is manufactured from
[1:21:23] is manufactured from your human spirit
[1:21:27] and then your body becomes a servant.
[1:21:31] So a man in that condition
[1:21:35] lives with a constant eternal battle.
[1:21:41] That's why the scripture says that there
[1:21:44] was war in heaven.
[1:21:48] There was no cigarette smoked yet.
[1:21:53] There was no alcohol drunker yet.
[1:21:57] There was no nightclub yet.
[1:22:01] But there was war in heaven.
[1:22:04] And that's where now the imaginations
[1:22:10] Amen. And a man who is not subject to
[1:22:14] the word
[1:22:16] has a constant battle in his life.
[1:22:22] Every morning he wakes up.
[1:22:25] He's in a battle,
[1:22:28] a battle to love,
[1:22:30] a battle to submit,
[1:22:33] a battle to do that which is right.
[1:22:37] is in battle on a constant.
[1:22:41] Where does the battle begin from? From
[1:22:44] the mind.
[1:22:46] So sin
[1:22:48] is a nature. And that nature
[1:22:53] affected Lucifer
[1:22:56] in heaven. And when he came down here on
[1:22:59] earth,
[1:23:00] then he began to manifest the fruits of
[1:23:04] sin.
[1:23:06] Amen. You see where it comes from? Check
[1:23:10] your mind.
[1:23:12] How you think about the brothers?
[1:23:15] Just think,
[1:23:17] look at your mind and ask God.
[1:23:24] I die daily. I die to my mind.
[1:23:31] I die to my imaginations.
[1:23:35] I die to the things I love.
[1:23:39] I die away from these fashions.
[1:23:45] Are you together with me? So a man in
[1:23:48] that condition
[1:23:50] lives in a constant battle.
[1:23:54] Romans 7. He's in battle. Let us look at
[1:23:59] 14
[1:24:01] and verse 13. The human spirit,
[1:24:05] your thinking area
[1:24:08] is where you cook
[1:24:11] and then your body can be able to
[1:24:14] manifest.
[1:24:18] Isaiah 14:13,
[1:24:21] for thou has said in thine heart,
[1:24:25] I will ascend into heaven.
[1:24:29] This is the mind of Lucifer
[1:24:31] before he waged war in heaven.
[1:24:35] Where did it begin from? From the mind.
[1:24:40] It began from the mind. What do you
[1:24:43] think?
[1:24:46] What do you feed on in your mind?
[1:24:50] Why don't you reject the negative mind
[1:24:54] and say, "I died.
[1:24:59] Amen. He says, "For thou said in thine
[1:25:02] heart,
[1:25:05] I will ascend into heaven. I exalt my
[1:25:08] throne above the stars of God.
[1:25:13] I will sit also upon the mount of the
[1:25:16] congregation
[1:25:20] in the sights of the north."
[1:25:25] He's saying,
[1:25:27] If I cannot overthrow your kingdom,
[1:25:31] I will have another kingdom.
[1:25:36] He says, I will sit also
[1:25:40] in the sides of the north.
[1:25:42] I will ascend above the heights of the
[1:25:44] clouds.
[1:25:47] I'll be like the most high.
[1:25:51] The desire of his heart,
[1:25:53] a mind not subject to the world
[1:26:01] is where leprosy begins from.
[1:26:07] And kills the nerve center.
[1:26:12] Amen. Eating up the members of the body.
[1:26:18] But then you are unconscious
[1:26:22] of the pain.
[1:26:24] That's how terrible is.
[1:26:28] Your finger
[1:26:31] begins to be answerous.
[1:26:36] And now it's off this finger
[1:26:40] and it falls away without realizing
[1:26:44] pain.
[1:26:48] That's how bad leprosy is.
[1:26:52] You may not know that you are being
[1:26:53] eaten.
[1:26:57] And you may even attack the ministry
[1:27:01] simply because you are not conscious.
[1:27:04] You are a leper. You step on the fire.
[1:27:08] You are not even aware. The minister is
[1:27:12] just a position
[1:27:14] God gave to the priest
[1:27:17] to determine the condition of the leper.
[1:27:23] Are you together with me? Yeah. Just to
[1:27:26] determine the condition of the leper.
[1:27:30] And now if that leopard knew
[1:27:33] that there was a solution,
[1:27:36] Amen. like Hmon. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:27:41] They would run to the prophet.
[1:27:45] Hallelujah.
[1:27:46] Amen. Amen. So all this was running
[1:27:49] through the mind of Lucifer,
[1:27:52] the desire of an alternative kingdom
[1:27:56] to be like the most high.
[1:27:59] A mind not subject to the word.
[1:28:03] I told you is where begins from.
[1:28:07] Amen. Amen. Now we thank God for the
[1:28:11] prophet the message of the hour. Can we
[1:28:15] say amen here?
[1:28:18] We would have just read Bible stories.
[1:28:22] There was a leper and then he was healed
[1:28:26] and then he went to Jordan and then he
[1:28:29] dipped himself in the water.
[1:28:32] How do we connect it
[1:28:34] to our condition in the New Testament?
[1:28:38] We thank God for the message.
[1:28:42] Amen. So the prophet came out with a
[1:28:46] deeper insight on leprosy.
[1:28:51] He says in this message
[1:28:54] blinders.
[1:28:57] He says leprosy
[1:29:00] is caused by an insufficient diet.
[1:29:08] And it's not contagious.
[1:29:15] Are you together with me? Yeah. Some
[1:29:17] people say, "Oh, you know, lepros is
[1:29:19] contagious."
[1:29:23] He says, "No, it comes from false diet."
[1:29:29] So the prophet is connecting leprosy
[1:29:35] to the word a false diet
[1:29:39] in message water and separation.
[1:29:44] He says I just learned from some medical
[1:29:46] research the other day
[1:29:52] that leprosy
[1:29:54] is caused from wrong diet.
[1:29:57] That's the cause. That's what causes sin
[1:30:01] is the wrong spiritual diet.
[1:30:07] Leprosy that only God alone can cure.
[1:30:13] Are you together with me? He's telling
[1:30:16] you that's what causes sin
[1:30:20] is a spiritual wrong diet.
[1:30:26] Amen. So the people are malnourished
[1:30:34] are not given the all of God.
[1:30:40] Are you together with me? They are not
[1:30:42] given the curse of God.
[1:30:45] And many of them finally walk away from
[1:30:49] this precious.
[1:30:53] Why? because they are given the message
[1:30:55] in pieces.
[1:30:59] They are not given the workers of God.
[1:31:03] There are certain things that are cut
[1:31:04] out of the
[1:31:07] Amen. They don't teach on the seventh
[1:31:09] seal.
[1:31:12] They don't teach on the ministry of the
[1:31:13] son of man.
[1:31:16] St. Luke 17:30
[1:31:20] Thessalonians 13
[1:31:24] deficiency.
[1:31:32] Praise the Lord. Yes, sir. He says that
[1:31:35] it's wrong nutrition,
[1:31:39] a feeding deficit,
[1:31:43] spiritual malnutrition.
[1:31:46] will cause spiritual leprosy
[1:31:50] that will cut the people away
[1:31:53] from the body of the church.
[1:31:59] For us, we don't believe that because
[1:32:02] they were given only certain direction
[1:32:04] of the word
[1:32:07] and it caused a spiritual leprosy to
[1:32:10] them.
[1:32:13] Amen. Amen. in the New Testament.
[1:32:16] I said lepros is a spiritual condition.
[1:32:21] Now listen, so dealing with lepros in
[1:32:24] your testament
[1:32:27] was
[1:32:30] it was dealing with the outer man
[1:32:34] that was in the Old Testament.
[1:32:39] A shadow of things in the New Testament.
[1:32:45] And I want to tell you here
[1:32:47] that the Old Testament
[1:32:51] as it was,
[1:32:56] you know, not perfect worship.
[1:33:03] Much as there were certain physical
[1:33:06] things
[1:33:09] like a physical tabernacle,
[1:33:13] like the altars,
[1:33:15] the chemistry of the blood,
[1:33:19] the lamps that were slaughtered,
[1:33:22] but those were shadows from the true I
[1:33:25] mean from the pattern of the true
[1:33:26] worship.
[1:33:31] So the Old Testament priesthood
[1:33:35] ministered in shadows,
[1:33:39] but the priest mechs
[1:33:44] in the true tabernacle
[1:33:47] of your soul.
[1:33:50] for worship
[1:33:52] has moved from shadows
[1:33:55] to reality
[1:33:57] from the natural priest.
[1:34:00] Amen. To the spiritual priest,
[1:34:03] they kissed it. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:34:06] Hallelujah. In the natural worship,
[1:34:09] it was limited
[1:34:12] because the priest was a man.
[1:34:15] He was limited.
[1:34:17] But in the New Testament, the priest is
[1:34:21] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:34:24] Hallelujah. Who is able to give you a
[1:34:27] change?
[1:34:29] Who is able to heal your leprosy
[1:34:33] if you can save
[1:34:35] this morning?
[1:34:39] Praise the Lord. Amen. He ministers
[1:34:44] in the center there
[1:34:46] and it's the center that must be taken
[1:34:50] over
[1:34:51] so that the body can minister
[1:34:54] righteousness.
[1:34:58] Do you see what I'm saying? The center
[1:35:01] must be taken over.
[1:35:04] The leprosy condition
[1:35:06] it attacks the center
[1:35:10] in the soul. That's why the scripture
[1:35:12] says the soul that sinnth
[1:35:17] it shall die it shall be cut off. So
[1:35:22] when he comes he comes like a high
[1:35:25] priest.
[1:35:27] The new testament
[1:35:29] he comes through the flesh. He goes
[1:35:32] through the spiritual
[1:35:34] and then he goes to the center
[1:35:36] and unites himself to you
[1:35:40] in a marriage union
[1:35:44] in an invisible union
[1:35:47] Christ will be born in you.
[1:35:53] That's what we need this morning.
[1:35:56] Amen. Amen. from the natural priesthood
[1:36:00] to the spiritual priesthood of Melism.
[1:36:04] That's why Paul says, "Know ye not that
[1:36:08] you are the temple of God and that the
[1:36:11] spirit of God
[1:36:13] dwells in you.
[1:36:15] And when the spirit dwells in you,
[1:36:18] it takes control
[1:36:21] of your human spirit.
[1:36:25] much as you still have battles to fight,
[1:36:29] but you've got a commander
[1:36:32] of the Lord's army
[1:36:35] living with you.
[1:36:38] Amen. You appeal to the commander,
[1:36:41] look at this temptation,
[1:36:44] it's almost taking me. You tell the
[1:36:46] commander, he dwells on the side of you.
[1:36:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you tell the
[1:36:52] commander, I want to die daily.
[1:36:58] Praise the Lord. So, Amen. Amen. The
[1:37:02] priest Melisdc,
[1:37:05] the Holy Spirit, he ministers in the
[1:37:09] center,
[1:37:11] in the real tabernacle,
[1:37:14] not in the shadows.
[1:37:16] Know ye not that you are the temple of
[1:37:18] God?
[1:37:20] Amen. Amen. And in the Old Testament,
[1:37:23] the priests gave daily sacrifice
[1:37:28] daily ministration.
[1:37:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the priest,
[1:37:33] the Holy Spirit, once a daily
[1:37:36] ministration,
[1:37:39] reveal this word,
[1:37:41] this word,
[1:37:43] that wickedness,
[1:37:44] the other weakness.
[1:37:47] Praise the Lord. Old Testament
[1:37:50] dealt with the first
[1:37:54] and second
[1:37:57] of a man body and human spirit.
[1:38:05] Are you understanding me? That's where
[1:38:09] the Old Testament would end.
[1:38:13] Brother Brham says in the anointed,
[1:38:18] notice
[1:38:19] the very day when this messenger,
[1:38:24] not when he starts on
[1:38:28] but when he begins to declare his
[1:38:33] first pool
[1:38:35] healing.
[1:38:36] Second pool prophesy. Third pool, the
[1:38:41] opening of the word,
[1:38:44] three pools.
[1:38:46] But the Old Testament
[1:38:48] worked with the first pool
[1:38:51] and second pool. Pentecost
[1:38:55] works with the first pool,
[1:38:58] second P, healing of the natural body,
[1:39:02] and then discerning of the human spirit.
[1:39:08] Amen. Amen. So that's justification,
[1:39:13] sanctification,
[1:39:15] they don't go beyond that.
[1:39:21] Are you still there? Amen.
[1:39:24] So the first pool
[1:39:27] and the second pool
[1:39:29] was God dealing with the natural man.
[1:39:34] Because I told you the car can man
[1:39:38] this body and the human spirit which
[1:39:42] activates it to live.
[1:39:47] that the spiritual man
[1:39:50] in the soul
[1:39:52] that comes from God
[1:39:55] and must be quickened
[1:39:57] for a man to overcome
[1:39:59] man.
[1:40:04] You'll give this man 100 loaves,
[1:40:08] but unless that seed on the inside
[1:40:13] has been quickened,
[1:40:15] the body will remain a servant to sin.
[1:40:22] Are you together with me? So the first
[1:40:25] pool
[1:40:26] and second pool is God dealing with the
[1:40:29] natural man.
[1:40:32] But the purpose
[1:40:34] of these two pools
[1:40:37] is to bring a man
[1:40:39] to the revelation of Christ.
[1:40:44] Are you together with me? Amen. So I
[1:40:47] want you to see I want my interpreter to
[1:40:51] step down.
[1:40:54] Go down right there.
[1:40:58] Now turn this way. There are steps here.
[1:41:03] This man here is weak.
[1:41:05] I must motivate him.
[1:41:08] I'll give him the first P
[1:41:11] and then he stands there. He's motivated
[1:41:15] that I can grow further. I give him the
[1:41:18] second. I bring him here. But the
[1:41:22] purpose is to bring him into the third
[1:41:25] pool the revelation of Christ.
[1:41:29] Amen. That is the purpose.
[1:41:33] The signs
[1:41:34] and wonders, the miracles, the preaching
[1:41:38] on sanctification
[1:41:40] is to bring a man into fellowship with
[1:41:44] Christ.
[1:41:48] So that's what brother Brener means
[1:41:52] by a pool.
[1:41:54] Amen. Now when he starts by the first
[1:41:59] now he said here in this quote here
[1:42:02] not when he starts
[1:42:05] but when he begins to declare the
[1:42:07] message.
[1:42:09] So the first and second pull
[1:42:13] are you together with me is when he's
[1:42:16] starting
[1:42:18] but when he begins to sound the message
[1:42:23] that's the third point.
[1:42:26] Amen. Because the entire purpose
[1:42:30] was to bring man into fellowship with
[1:42:33] God. And that's what every ministry is
[1:42:36] concerned about.
[1:42:38] So the first and second book,
[1:42:42] let me take you back to now.
[1:42:46] Amen. It is God
[1:42:49] dealing with N's natural condition,
[1:42:55] the healing of the body. And that's
[1:42:57] where the believer
[1:43:00] want to stop
[1:43:04] simply because
[1:43:06] it can produce immediate result
[1:43:12] and a man can see a miracle.
[1:43:16] I know God is great. God is great. Yes,
[1:43:22] he was great. through his ministry
[1:43:26] and healed many people. He raised the
[1:43:28] dead, he opened the blind eye, the
[1:43:32] purpose was to bring the people in the
[1:43:35] upper room.
[1:43:39] Whoever didn't get into the upper room
[1:43:42] to the true bashing of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:46] into the revealing of Christ,
[1:43:49] whatever he had here was inquession.
[1:43:56] The purpose is to bring you into
[1:44:00] fellowship with Christ.
[1:44:03] Okay. Leprosy
[1:44:06] is an undesirable condition
[1:44:10] that comes from unbalanced diet.
[1:44:16] Amen. Amen. And we need to give the
[1:44:18] people
[1:44:20] the entire council of God.
[1:44:26] Are you together with me? So that we
[1:44:28] feed them
[1:44:31] with all the vitamins, vitamin, vitamin
[1:44:34] A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin B,
[1:44:37] vitamin C, and B16 and all these kind of
[1:44:40] things
[1:44:41] so that we can build the spiritual body
[1:44:46] of the believer and as a person feeds
[1:44:51] then the leprosy
[1:44:53] begins to phase out.
[1:44:57] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. So now
[1:45:03] I just want to tell you
[1:45:07] that God
[1:45:09] doesn't want you in the condition where
[1:45:11] you are.
[1:45:14] He wants you into fellowship with him.
[1:45:17] Coming to church is not enough.
[1:45:21] Amen. When you are a leper of some kind,
[1:45:27] God wants us in fellowship with him.
[1:45:30] But yet leprosy
[1:45:32] does not allow us to enter into
[1:45:35] fellowship with.
[1:45:37] So the word that we hear and feed on the
[1:45:42] message of the hour deals with the
[1:45:45] lepous condition
[1:45:47] so that we can come into fellowship
[1:45:50] with God.
[1:45:53] How many want fellowship with God?
[1:45:56] Not just coming to church
[1:45:59] fellowship with God.
[1:46:03] So that at home you are in fellowship
[1:46:06] with God.
[1:46:07] At work, you are in fellowship with God.
[1:46:10] When you come to church, you are not
[1:46:13] coming to meet brothers.
[1:46:15] You are in fellowship with God.
[1:46:19] Amen. Amen. That's what we are here for,
[1:46:21] friends.
[1:46:23] So, brother Brennham tells of a dream of
[1:46:27] a young fellow
[1:46:29] that was in shackles
[1:46:32] and was fighting to get free.
[1:46:36] I want you to follow this. Now, as he
[1:46:39] narrates this dream,
[1:46:43] he was dealing with a spiritual
[1:46:45] condition.
[1:46:47] So, we shall dab it leprosy.
[1:46:52] So, I would not be able to tell
[1:46:56] what kind of shackles are binding you
[1:47:04] because every one of us
[1:47:06] wants to be free.
[1:47:09] Whom the son of man sets free
[1:47:13] is free indeed.
[1:47:16] We don't want to feel shackles,
[1:47:19] shackles of hatred,
[1:47:22] shackles of malice,
[1:47:24] shackles of competition,
[1:47:27] different shackles.
[1:47:29] We don't need to be part of shackles.
[1:47:34] Amen. Amen. And you are the only one who
[1:47:38] can tell
[1:47:40] part of me is in the shackle.
[1:47:45] And then you tell God, "By the time I
[1:47:48] leave out here, I want to go thanking
[1:47:51] you because they've got a prophet in the
[1:47:54] land."
[1:47:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He has been
[1:47:58] given the commission
[1:48:01] to feed the church with the word.
[1:48:04] As the church feels
[1:48:07] balancingly,
[1:48:10] Amen. then the leprosy gets healed,
[1:48:14] the shackles fall away.
[1:48:18] Amen. What shackles, I don't know, but a
[1:48:22] spiritual condition
[1:48:24] which you don't desire.
[1:48:27] That's your leprosy.
[1:48:31] Amen. Amen. He wants to release you
[1:48:34] and bring you into fellowship with
[1:48:36] himself.
[1:48:39] Are you together with me? Because
[1:48:41] justification
[1:48:43] like you never did it before.
[1:48:45] Sanctification
[1:48:47] is very good. The secret goal
[1:48:51] life goes.
[1:48:54] But that's not enough. The purpose is to
[1:48:58] bring you into fellowship
[1:49:00] until you come into fellowship with him.
[1:49:04] Your fallen shackles being nothing.
[1:49:11] Amen. Amen. So he says in this dream, I
[1:49:17] seen a brother Roy Borders. Roy Borders,
[1:49:21] a good friend of mine lives in
[1:49:24] California.
[1:49:25] looked like there is something wrong.
[1:49:29] His eyes were half closed.
[1:49:33] Maybe a cancer
[1:49:35] or something over his eyes.
[1:49:39] Someone was trying to pull me away from
[1:49:42] him.
[1:49:45] I screamed,
[1:49:48] "Breers,
[1:49:50] in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:49:53] snap out of that.
[1:49:57] It was a condition.
[1:50:00] He says maybe it was a cancer,
[1:50:04] but it was a shackle.
[1:50:07] And then he says prior than Roy Borders
[1:50:12] out of that
[1:50:14] and he just barely could speak saying
[1:50:20] brother
[1:50:22] to take something more than this.
[1:50:26] I just can't grasp it.
[1:50:30] I can't grasp it. I said, "Oh, brother
[1:50:34] Borders."
[1:50:37] He was calling him out,
[1:50:40] out of the situation,
[1:50:42] out of the shackles. That's what a
[1:50:44] minister does. The pastor stands out
[1:50:47] here, calling us out of the shackles.
[1:50:51] But the man in the shackles
[1:50:54] says it takes more than this.
[1:50:58] And I want to bring you more than this
[1:51:03] so that you can break from those
[1:51:05] circles.
[1:51:09] He say you know he says oh brother
[1:51:12] borders.
[1:51:14] So we are dealing with a spiritual
[1:51:16] condition
[1:51:18] where man cannot redeem himself.
[1:51:22] The condition of neon
[1:51:25] the condition he was in and it's like
[1:51:28] it.
[1:51:30] So there is a level
[1:51:33] of supernatural grace
[1:51:36] that transforms the life of a man.
[1:51:42] Amen.
[1:51:44] He didn't like it.
[1:51:47] You see? So the dream
[1:51:49] then introduces brother Brennham
[1:51:53] to another person
[1:51:55] and that is Mrs. Fento
[1:51:59] and at this point somebody is trying to
[1:52:02] pull the prophet away
[1:52:06] from these people. The other time pull
[1:52:09] him away from brother Bord this time
[1:52:13] pull him away from these people
[1:52:18] fetas
[1:52:22] leprosy
[1:52:25] and separates the people
[1:52:28] from the fellowship of the body.
[1:52:34] And she said, "Brother Brham,
[1:52:37] deliver us from this.
[1:52:39] This is a house of hell."
[1:52:46] Like the condition.
[1:52:49] And when he heard of a prophet in the
[1:52:51] land,
[1:52:53] he was running to the prophet
[1:52:56] to be set free. Aren't we happy this
[1:52:59] morning that we have a prophet in the
[1:53:02] land?
[1:53:03] Run to the message of the hour. Run to
[1:53:07] the message so that you may feast on the
[1:53:11] different vitamins
[1:53:14] to set you free.
[1:53:17] Amen. You see, this Mrs. Fenton
[1:53:23] understood the condition
[1:53:25] and said, "This is the house of hell.
[1:53:29] You've been misunderstood
[1:53:32] and you misunderstood these people too.
[1:53:36] Amen. Amen. Now that's the whole issue
[1:53:40] that the people misunderstand the
[1:53:44] minister
[1:53:46] and the minister misunderstands the
[1:53:48] people.
[1:53:51] But once a man is in shackles,
[1:53:54] he can't set himself free.
[1:53:57] There is a supernatural grace
[1:54:00] that must come down this morning
[1:54:04] to set Fenton free
[1:54:07] and to set Roy Borders free.
[1:54:10] Amen. Then this woman was saying
[1:54:14] these are fine people.
[1:54:17] Then he says, I looked over there. like
[1:54:21] a great big cellar,
[1:54:25] big walls
[1:54:28] down beneath big great cave
[1:54:33] and great iron bars
[1:54:37] 8 or 10 in thick
[1:54:40] and peep out of their mind.
[1:54:44] the arms
[1:54:46] and legs beating their heads
[1:54:50] like that and crying
[1:54:53] saying deliver the people.
[1:54:58] Amen. Deliver the people help us. We are
[1:55:03] in trouble.
[1:55:05] That was Mrs. Phantom
[1:55:07] no in a condition he didn't like he
[1:55:12] couldn't heal himself
[1:55:16] a spiritual condition.
[1:55:21] Amen. So I looked around
[1:55:25] and I said
[1:55:28] I wish I could
[1:55:32] because they were saying brother Brener
[1:55:36] deliver the people. He looked around and
[1:55:40] he said, "I wish
[1:55:43] I could."
[1:55:45] It takes a prophet in that
[1:55:49] and the Holy Spirit is the prophet in
[1:55:53] the land today.
[1:55:55] Amen. He holds the power
[1:55:59] to read you from that condition.
[1:56:03] Amen.
[1:56:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:07] And go on looking
[1:56:10] my little beauty body
[1:56:15] and them great big
[1:56:21] and those people in there
[1:56:24] and you couldn't get to them.
[1:56:28] Great big iron bar
[1:56:32] sitting close together.
[1:56:35] And I looked and they were beating their
[1:56:38] heads like they were out of their mouth.
[1:56:42] A spiritual condition
[1:56:46] that could hold great men
[1:56:50] in great big cellars
[1:56:54] and I seen some lights
[1:56:57] flickering around in there.
[1:57:04] And I looked
[1:57:06] and there stood the Lord Jesus
[1:57:10] with lights of rainbow around him.
[1:57:15] He was looking
[1:57:17] right straight to me. And he said,
[1:57:21] "Deliver those people."
[1:57:23] And he went away.
[1:57:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In your
[1:57:28] condition, there is a light around you.
[1:57:32] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:57:35] and he has given the authority
[1:57:38] to the ministry
[1:57:40] to declare are you a leper to declare
[1:57:43] you heal
[1:57:45] and then the Holy Spirit said deliver
[1:57:47] those people
[1:57:51] praise the Lord. So there was enough
[1:57:53] light in there to please the lepers
[1:57:58] and the authority was given to the
[1:58:00] ministry to deliver the people.
[1:58:04] Amen. We are here to deliver the people
[1:58:09] and not to bind them to ourselves.
[1:58:13] Amen. And I thought, well,
[1:58:17] how could I deliver them?
[1:58:20] I haven't got strength
[1:58:22] enough in my arms to break those iron
[1:58:25] bars.
[1:58:27] So I say
[1:58:29] house of hell, give way to the name of
[1:58:32] Jesus Christ.
[1:58:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's the
[1:58:36] minister. Now he's talking to the house
[1:58:39] of hell. Give
[1:58:42] to the name of Jesus.
[1:58:46] Hallelujah. I want to tell everybody in
[1:58:49] the condition undesired
[1:58:52] there is a voice house of hell give way
[1:58:57] to the name of Jesus.
[1:59:00] Amen. Praise the Lord. And all the
[1:59:04] cracking and popping and the rocks
[1:59:08] rolling
[1:59:13] and the bars falling
[1:59:16] and people running,
[1:59:19] screaming,
[1:59:20] delivered
[1:59:22] and screaming at the top of their face.
[1:59:26] And he was all delivered.
[1:59:30] Leprosy,
[1:59:32] it disease
[1:59:37] the fats
[1:59:39] can be broken.
[1:59:42] Amen. and all the cracking
[1:59:48] and immediately the problem says I was
[1:59:52] screaming
[1:59:53] where the royal borders
[1:59:56] where are you where are you God is
[1:59:59] delivering his people borders borders
[2:00:02] amen are you bound in anywhere today
[2:00:07] holding you
[2:00:10] borders borders today God
[2:00:13] is delivering his people
[2:00:18] today. He's delivering his people.
[2:00:21] Not that we are not concerned
[2:00:25] about the strength of your fetters,
[2:00:29] but there is something
[2:00:31] greater than your fet.
[2:00:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So
[2:00:37] it's an addictive spiritual condition
[2:00:42] where only grace
[2:00:44] can set you free.
[2:00:46] Paul calls it the sin
[2:00:51] that easily besets itself.
[2:00:55] You easily quarrel
[2:00:58] and you don't like it.
[2:01:00] You easily fight.
[2:01:02] You don't like it.
[2:01:04] A sin that easily besets you
[2:01:09] becomes a shackle
[2:01:11] but it is a chable condition.
[2:01:17] It's a chable condition. Amen. The
[2:01:21] priest which is a spiritual office
[2:01:25] was ordained of God
[2:01:28] that in the course of his ministry
[2:01:31] he could discern the souls
[2:01:35] and declare them preach I mean lepers
[2:01:39] and in the course of his ministry
[2:01:42] he can start administering
[2:01:46] the different vitamins means
[2:01:50] to deliver the people.
[2:01:53] You come to church to be free,
[2:01:57] to be set free from those addictive
[2:02:01] situations.
[2:02:04] Amen. Listen intently to the
[2:02:06] examination.
[2:02:09] A doctor scans through
[2:02:12] and says that is temper.
[2:02:16] Now when he touches temper
[2:02:19] don't produce temper
[2:02:22] you know he's discerning you
[2:02:25] he says that one
[2:02:28] is rumor mongering
[2:02:30] you are going to split the church
[2:02:33] don't become mad
[2:02:37] because he is a priest
[2:02:41] he's discerning the leprosy
[2:02:44] the thing that could cut you off from
[2:02:45] your body.
[2:02:48] Amen. Amen. So the ministry
[2:02:51] examines the spots
[2:02:54] and the wrinkles.
[2:02:57] And if in the course of examination,
[2:03:02] you find yourself free.
[2:03:05] Why don't you step poor
[2:03:07] into divine fellowship with him?
[2:03:12] He has bread and wine for you.
[2:03:16] The word and the spirit
[2:03:18] once you into communion.
[2:03:21] Are you together with me?
[2:03:24] Condition.
[2:03:26] The word is the discerner.
[2:03:30] Amen. Of the intent
[2:03:33] of the word. I mean of the soul.
[2:03:38] So when the one begins to move by
[2:03:42] and you are touched a little bit
[2:03:46] just cry like Mrs. Fenton
[2:03:50] deliver us
[2:03:53] deliver us. So the priest
[2:03:57] in Acts chapter 2
[2:04:00] verse 37,
[2:04:02] let us look at the priest Moses,
[2:04:05] the priest Peter.
[2:04:07] He's discerning the condition of the
[2:04:09] people.
[2:04:11] Amen. Amen. He preaches
[2:04:14] and he puts it to them that they
[2:04:17] crucified the Lord.
[2:04:19] Now when they heard this, verse 37,
[2:04:24] when they heard this, they were pricked
[2:04:27] in their hearts and said unto Peter and
[2:04:31] the rest of the apostles, men and
[2:04:33] brethren,
[2:04:34] what shall we do?
[2:04:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:04:39] They didn't quaren
[2:04:42] and brethren,
[2:04:44] what shall we do? There is a bomb in
[2:04:48] Gilead.
[2:04:53] Amen. You just need to be free.
[2:04:57] Amen. You need a minister
[2:05:00] to reach that nerve center.
[2:05:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To go beyond
[2:05:06] your leprosy
[2:05:08] and get to that remaining sensation
[2:05:13] until you cry. and send men and
[2:05:16] brethren.
[2:05:18] What shall we do? That's the best
[2:05:21] response.
[2:05:22] When you are in fetus,
[2:05:25] you must cry for help.
[2:05:29] Amen. So now here the priest
[2:05:34] Peter he did so such
[2:05:40] and and asked the condition
[2:05:44] and asked the condition.
[2:05:49] Amen. and he dealt with the human spirit
[2:05:54] the lepous condition
[2:05:58] the rejection of the divine instruction
[2:06:02] when they rejected Christ
[2:06:05] and if they were touched to their heart
[2:06:08] when they were convinced
[2:06:10] and they were concerned
[2:06:13] the fetus broke loose
[2:06:16] and Dr. Peter,
[2:06:18] give them the prescription.
[2:06:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:06:24] Repent. And be baptized everyone
[2:06:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:06:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you will
[2:06:32] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost will
[2:06:36] be burned from the side.
[2:06:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. I
[2:06:43] want us to take a little junction here.
[2:06:47] Do you love him?
[2:06:49] Amen. Amen. So there must be a soul
[2:06:52] healing
[2:06:54] in this Elisha season.
[2:06:58] Amen.
[2:06:59] Elisha season
[2:07:02] because the spirit
[2:07:04] that was on Elijah the prophet
[2:07:08] Malachi 4 is now on Elishah the church.
[2:07:16] So it's the time
[2:07:19] of the healing
[2:07:21] of leprosy.
[2:07:25] Praise the Lord. You see, so we need to
[2:07:29] go
[2:07:31] to where the first and second pool
[2:07:36] was supposed to bring us to.
[2:07:39] The first pool
[2:07:41] gave this man the first step.
[2:07:45] And the second pool brought him to the
[2:07:48] second.
[2:07:50] The third pool brings him to the area of
[2:07:53] life.
[2:07:57] Fellowship
[2:07:59] with life himself.
[2:08:01] I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[2:08:08] Not sucking around the first and second
[2:08:10] pull all the time.
[2:08:15] But awaken
[2:08:18] the city.
[2:08:20] It has been sleeping in the boat,
[2:08:24] but the storms of time are hitting
[2:08:27] against the B.
[2:08:31] Somebody
[2:08:34] must awake Jesus.
[2:08:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody must
[2:08:39] awaken that CG.
[2:08:42] And there is a man here who can turn on
[2:08:45] the light.
[2:08:48] In this darkness,
[2:08:51] in this total darkness,
[2:08:53] the Holy Spirit is here to quicken
[2:08:58] our inner man.
[2:09:01] Amen. Amen. So, it's good bringing
[2:09:03] people.
[2:09:05] Amen. See, I think let me take you down
[2:09:09] here to numbers.
[2:09:14] Are you together with me? Amen. Amen.
[2:09:19] So, numbers 19,
[2:09:22] give me about 20 minutes, 30.
[2:09:27] Do you love the word?
[2:09:30] Amen. Amen. I know you do. Hallelujah.
[2:09:35] So Numbers 19:2,
[2:09:39] this is the ordinance of the law,
[2:09:44] which the Lord has commanded, saying,
[2:09:48] "Speak to the children of Israel,
[2:09:52] that they bring thee a red ha
[2:09:59] without spot,
[2:10:02] wherein is no blemish.
[2:10:06] and upon which never came yoke.
[2:10:14] Amen. Amen. The sacrifice,
[2:10:18] and he shall give unto the priest,
[2:10:25] that he may bring her forth without the
[2:10:28] camp.
[2:10:33] and one shall slay her before his face
[2:10:40] outside
[2:10:43] beyond the camp.
[2:10:48] So the sacrifice
[2:10:51] was taken without the camp
[2:10:58] not in the camp.
[2:11:00] It was taken outside the camp
[2:11:04] where sin was committed.
[2:11:08] You've lost fellowship
[2:11:12] and you hate the condition.
[2:11:15] You are outside the camp.
[2:11:18] You need to be reconciled to the
[2:11:21] fellowship.
[2:11:24] Are you together with me? Yeah. You need
[2:11:27] to come back to the car.
[2:11:30] But the sacrifice
[2:11:32] could not be done in the camp.
[2:11:36] It had to be done out of the camp
[2:11:39] because the cedars
[2:11:42] had gone beyond the camp
[2:11:45] and they were out sinning away from the
[2:11:47] temple.
[2:11:50] Are you together with me? That's where
[2:11:53] the sacrifice finds them.
[2:11:57] Now I want to tell you friends if you
[2:12:00] find yourself out of the camp
[2:12:04] the sacrifice is meeting you out of the
[2:12:07] camp
[2:12:09] today. That's where the sacrifice is
[2:12:12] meeting.
[2:12:14] Christ the sacrifice was not sacrificed
[2:12:18] inside Jerusalem
[2:12:21] where there was the tabernacle.
[2:12:23] He was taken beyond the city,
[2:12:27] outside the camp.
[2:12:29] If you feel you out of the camp,
[2:12:33] the sacrifice died out of the cup.
[2:12:37] Why? Because that's where you strength.
[2:12:41] That's where you get lost in the bar, in
[2:12:45] the nightclub, in all these things.
[2:12:48] sacrifice today is right there being
[2:12:52] sacrificed.
[2:12:56] Okay, that's where it was sacrificed.
[2:13:00] Amen. That sacrifice
[2:13:03] was taken without the camp.
[2:13:07] And the prophet says here in the message
[2:13:10] Israel and the church,
[2:13:13] Christ in the Old Testament,
[2:13:16] even the waters of separation,
[2:13:20] the red her,
[2:13:24] it could be a brown one.
[2:13:30] It had to be a red one,
[2:13:33] no spot on it.
[2:13:36] It had to be burned
[2:13:39] and then made into waters of separation
[2:13:45] and is to sprinkle the people
[2:13:49] after they had sinned
[2:13:51] and was gone outside of the camp.
[2:13:57] So the water
[2:13:59] was right there. How did they get the
[2:14:02] waters of separation?
[2:14:05] And what was the waters of separation?
[2:14:09] To separate the people from the sin
[2:14:13] condition that they can come back into
[2:14:15] the again,
[2:14:18] come back into the body because lepros
[2:14:22] had broken them off.
[2:14:24] Oh, are you together with me? I don't
[2:14:28] know what you are feeling today, but I
[2:14:30] know one thing that the waters of
[2:14:33] separation are still present.
[2:14:36] You can still wash
[2:14:39] and come back in and still be able to
[2:14:42] lift up your hands and worship God and
[2:14:46] say, "Lord, you are wonderful. Lord, I
[2:14:49] appreciate you. Lord, you are my savior.
[2:14:52] You are bringing me back in. It is
[2:14:55] possible.
[2:14:56] It is possible the fetterss
[2:15:00] can be broken.
[2:15:04] The waters are present.
[2:15:08] Amen. Numbers 19
[2:15:12] verse 9. He says, "And a man that's
[2:15:17] clean
[2:15:18] shall gather up the ashes of the
[2:15:23] and let them up without the camp
[2:15:28] in a clean place
[2:15:30] and shall be kept
[2:15:33] for the congregation of the children of
[2:15:35] Israel
[2:15:37] for a water of separation.
[2:15:41] It's a purification for sin.
[2:15:47] Do you need waters of separation today?
[2:15:51] It is already there. The sacrifice shall
[2:15:56] never lose his power.
[2:15:58] until the last ransom
[2:16:05] together with me. Why don't you wash and
[2:16:09] come back to the center
[2:16:12] into fellowship?
[2:16:14] Brother Brham says in the message
[2:16:16] fellowship, he says then every man out
[2:16:19] of fellowship
[2:16:27] Come up fast
[2:16:31] to the waters of separation
[2:16:34] at the congregation
[2:16:36] and he was sprinkled with these waters.
[2:16:40] What was it? The waters spoke of a dead
[2:16:44] sacrifice
[2:16:46] that went before him.
[2:16:52] Are you together with me? because that
[2:16:55] blood
[2:16:57] went ahead.
[2:17:00] Amen. Amen. So the dead
[2:17:04] in his place
[2:17:07] and when we preach the word
[2:17:11] listen
[2:17:13] is not a denomination
[2:17:15] is on Christ
[2:17:18] the sacrifice
[2:17:19] who died in your state
[2:17:22] for sin instead.
[2:17:24] You are out of fellowship.
[2:17:28] Can't get prayer answered.
[2:17:31] Everything is black around you.
[2:17:34] Out of fellowship.
[2:17:37] Come back to the word. Now the word goes
[2:17:41] to cutting separates you.
[2:17:46] You don't have fellowship no more.
[2:17:49] You got yourself out of communion.
[2:17:56] That's the waters of separation
[2:17:59] tells you what you should do.
[2:18:04] So in your testament
[2:18:07] listener
[2:18:09] was washed
[2:18:13] [Music]
[2:18:14] to be restored
[2:18:17] to a natural fellowship.
[2:18:20] just join
[2:18:22] fellowship with people. But in the New
[2:18:25] Testament,
[2:18:27] the leper is the sinner
[2:18:31] that grace
[2:18:33] washes
[2:18:36] through justification,
[2:18:38] sanctification,
[2:18:40] and bring him into fellowship with
[2:18:43] Christ.
[2:18:48] Amen. There is a prophet in the land.
[2:18:52] Let me strike that
[2:18:55] and then God willing we shall get out of
[2:18:58] here.
[2:19:00] Now Elisha was a prophet in the land
[2:19:04] in the cleansing of
[2:19:08] God knows how to do these things.
[2:19:13] that girl
[2:19:15] had to be in captivity
[2:19:18] so that she could be a testifier
[2:19:22] of the prophet in the land.
[2:19:28] So between the old
[2:19:31] and the new testament
[2:19:33] there was another prophet in the land
[2:19:38] that's the son of man
[2:19:41] and he cleansed 10 lepers
[2:19:44] but only one
[2:19:47] went beyond the waters of separation
[2:19:51] and came back
[2:19:55] Are you together with me? Cleans lepers.
[2:20:01] A sanctified condition
[2:20:05] that allows you to come among the
[2:20:07] people.
[2:20:10] Not reports of sin anymore.
[2:20:16] Not that fellowship is bad from you.
[2:20:25] No, no, you are washed.
[2:20:29] Those are waters of separation.
[2:20:33] You don't drink. You don't smoke. You
[2:20:36] don't do all kinds of dirt stuff. You
[2:20:38] are not on drugs. You are not a
[2:20:41] prostitute.
[2:20:42] You are being washed.
[2:20:45] But what is the washing floor
[2:20:49] should bring you into fellowship with
[2:20:51] Christ.
[2:20:54] And when you come into fellowship with
[2:20:56] him,
[2:20:57] the pastor
[2:21:00] will not fight you about keeping time in
[2:21:03] church.
[2:21:05] No,
[2:21:07] you are in fellowship with him.
[2:21:10] You are in love with him. You are the
[2:21:13] 10th leper.
[2:21:16] You are looking for fellowship with him.
[2:21:20] Are you together with him? You
[2:21:22] participate in fellowship.
[2:21:25] You love the brotherhood.
[2:21:28] You love the world. You are part of a
[2:21:31] body.
[2:21:32] Amen. And your sin
[2:21:36] is beyond the group where you are.
[2:21:41] Are you together with me? You are
[2:21:43] looking at fellowship with Christ.
[2:21:47] You are looking beyond
[2:21:50] brothers and sisters
[2:21:53] come to church with you.
[2:21:55] You are in fellowship with Christ.
[2:21:58] And because we're in fellowship with
[2:22:00] Christ,
[2:22:02] a pill of fire
[2:22:05] and the pillow of fire is always a king
[2:22:09] with another portion of the pillar of
[2:22:11] fire.
[2:22:14] Because when you come to church, you
[2:22:16] feel greater, better
[2:22:19] when you listen to the tape at home
[2:22:22] and when you read the book at home and
[2:22:25] when the church doors are open.
[2:22:28] I am going
[2:22:30] to meet my brothers.
[2:22:33] Hallelujah. You have gone beyond the
[2:22:35] waters of
[2:22:38] fellowship.
[2:22:41] One time, brother Brandham was casting
[2:22:45] out devils.
[2:22:47] And when he was casting out a devil out
[2:22:50] of somebody, that devil was screaming
[2:22:55] to another person who had the same kind
[2:22:58] of spirit.
[2:23:00] That spirit should come and help this
[2:23:06] can call for fellowship
[2:23:11] who has been born again washed by the
[2:23:14] blood confessed with the Holy Ghost. How
[2:23:18] can you stay home when there is an
[2:23:20] assemb of the saint?
[2:23:26] How
[2:23:29] in Israel when they were coming out of
[2:23:32] Egypt?
[2:23:34] Do you hear me?
[2:23:37] God told I mean Moses told Pharaoh
[2:23:41] that let the people go and worship.
[2:23:45] And Pharaoh said, "Okay, let the mature
[2:23:49] ones go."
[2:23:51] And Moses said, "No,
[2:23:54] even our children,
[2:23:56] we don't leave them."
[2:23:58] How can we leave our children
[2:24:01] when we can afford to bring them to the
[2:24:04] house of the Lord?
[2:24:10] They grow into a problem.
[2:24:14] Bring them
[2:24:15] into the presence of the Lord.
[2:24:20] Somebody say amen.
[2:24:23] St. Luke 17.
[2:24:26] Do you love the word?
[2:24:28] Amen. Amen.
[2:24:31] I preached this in the convention
[2:24:36] last weekend.
[2:24:40] We had about 2,000 people
[2:24:44] and the Lord blessed us.
[2:24:47] Amen. Amen. St. Luke 17:12.
[2:24:52] And as he entered into a certain
[2:24:55] village,
[2:24:58] there met him 10 men
[2:25:02] that were lepers
[2:25:04] which stood a far off.
[2:25:07] They knew their condition.
[2:25:10] that they could not have access to
[2:25:12] fellowship
[2:25:15] and they lift up their voices and say,
[2:25:20] "Jesus,
[2:25:22] Master,
[2:25:24] have mercy on us." They were asking for
[2:25:27] saving grace.
[2:25:31] And when he saw them, he said unto them,
[2:25:35] "Go, show yourself to the priest.
[2:25:38] And it came to pass that as they went,
[2:25:43] they were cleansed,
[2:25:45] and one of them,
[2:25:47] when they saw that he was healed,
[2:25:52] turned back
[2:25:54] and with a loud voice,
[2:25:57] glorify
[2:25:59] God.
[2:26:02] The first and second pool
[2:26:07] brings him to the third pole,
[2:26:10] the revealed Christ
[2:26:15] come into fellowship.
[2:26:18] And he fell down on his face at his
[2:26:20] feet,
[2:26:22] giving him thanks,
[2:26:25] and he was a Samaritan.
[2:26:28] Jesus answer and say,
[2:26:32] "Where are where were they not 10
[2:26:37] cleansed?
[2:26:41] But where
[2:26:43] are the nine?
[2:26:47] Where
[2:26:50] are the nine?"
[2:26:52] They stop at the first
[2:26:55] and second pool.
[2:26:57] First pool healing of the body.
[2:27:01] Second pool conviction
[2:27:05] of sin. Never do wrong anymore.
[2:27:09] And they thought that was enough.
[2:27:15] That was because
[2:27:18] he wanted them into fellowship.
[2:27:22] Where are the nine?
[2:27:28] Thank God you are the 10th leper.
[2:27:32] But where are the nine?
[2:27:36] God make me
[2:27:38] the 10th leper
[2:27:40] that goes beyond the cleansing of the
[2:27:43] human spirit
[2:27:46] that goes beyond the waters of
[2:27:48] separation
[2:27:51] into fellowship with Christ.
[2:27:55] Are you together with me? That's what we
[2:27:58] are here for, friends.
[2:28:00] Find fellowship.
[2:28:05] Listen, fellowship with God
[2:28:09] through reconciliation.
[2:28:11] He says it's good to come to church.
[2:28:16] It's good to be baptized
[2:28:18] and so forth, which is all right. But
[2:28:22] every month
[2:28:24] coming into this divine fellowship
[2:28:28] has recognized
[2:28:30] that before him went Jesus Christ
[2:28:35] with his own blood and he sprinkled the
[2:28:38] way
[2:28:40] and put the strips of blood over the
[2:28:42] door
[2:28:46] as he went in. Not like
[2:28:51] with the blood of an animal
[2:28:54] we his own blood
[2:28:57] stands in the presence of God tonight
[2:29:01] making intercession.
[2:29:07] I went before you and sprinkled the path
[2:29:13] with blood
[2:29:15] having boldness.
[2:29:19] to enter
[2:29:20] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.
[2:29:25] Not by your works, but by the blood of
[2:29:27] Jesus. The boldiness
[2:29:30] for you to enter there. Will you enter
[2:29:33] into the presence?
[2:29:36] Amen. To find mercy
[2:29:38] and help in the time of need.
[2:29:42] So we thank God who has given us a
[2:29:44] prophet in the land. that has dealt with
[2:29:49] our condition
[2:29:52] and has not left us into the waters of
[2:29:55] separation
[2:29:58] but has
[2:29:59] married us to Christ.
[2:30:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. And
[2:30:06] now we know who we are. We are the bride
[2:30:10] of the living word.
[2:30:13] Are you together with me? There's a
[2:30:15] prophet in the land.
[2:30:17] pressing the pride in the cloth of the
[2:30:20] wording
[2:30:22] to him in a divine fellowship.
[2:30:27] And because this divine fellowship
[2:30:30] invisible union's
[2:30:36] here in fellowship with us,
[2:30:39] he's here. He's here. You know, he's he
[2:30:44] cares for you. That's why we have the
[2:30:46] waters of
[2:30:49] Will you go out there and say Lord break
[2:30:52] my fas.
[2:30:55] That should be our desire
[2:30:58] that the fetterss
[2:31:00] should be broken.
[2:31:05] [Music]
[2:31:09] You are begging.
[2:31:11] The leper cried
[2:31:15] and he says, "Master,
[2:31:18] have mercy."
[2:31:20] And I trust all of you are cleansed
[2:31:24] lepers
[2:31:26] from the blood of Jesus.
[2:31:28] But you have to take the next step,
[2:31:31] a personal
[2:31:33] connection to Christ.
