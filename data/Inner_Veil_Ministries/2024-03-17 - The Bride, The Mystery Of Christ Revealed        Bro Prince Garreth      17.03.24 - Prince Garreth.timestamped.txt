[32:51] Christ I greet you all in the name of
[32:53] the Lord Jesus
[32:55] Christ it's such a pleasure to be
[32:57] standing before for you this
[33:00] morning and not because I am any
[33:04] better but it's by the grace of
[33:07] God if at all I respect The Men Who
[33:10] stand before the sacred
[33:13] desk if at all I respect The Men Who
[33:15] stand behind the sacred
[33:19] desk because they are men of
[33:22] God and it's not an easy thing to stand
[33:26] here especially when you are preaching
[33:28] to people who have been taught
[33:31] well I always say it's one of the
[33:33] hardest things to preach to people that
[33:35] know what you're talking
[33:39] about because if you make a
[33:42] mistake they can actually look at you
[33:44] and say brother you mised
[33:47] there and the elders will call you after
[33:51] church and say my brother go and sit
[33:53] down a little bit
[33:56] more and start to prove yourself worthy
[33:59] of the
[34:01] vocation whereby you are
[34:04] called so I respect
[34:06] them I always feel nervous when I stand
[34:10] here one can never get
[34:13] used so it's such a
[34:16] pleasure to be in front of You The
[34:18] Chosen bride of
[34:21] Christ in this last day and
[34:25] hour this is the greatest time that any
[34:27] believer would have wanted to live
[34:30] in the prophet explains and say Daniel
[34:33] wanted to leave in this
[34:36] day David wanted to live in this
[34:40] day where all things that were being
[34:42] spoken of by the
[34:44] prophets are being made
[34:47] manifest but it was not given to
[34:50] them but to you and me so like Esther
[34:55] perhaps we were born for such a time as
[34:56] this
[34:59] to prove the devil
[35:01] dead to prove the devil
[35:04] dead and to prove to him that the second
[35:06] Eve will not
[35:08] fail such a
[35:11] privilege I will kindly ask you to join
[35:13] in with
[35:15] me this uh one verse from this song down
[35:19] from his
[35:22] glory we are just going to sing the last
[35:24] verse in the
[35:26] chorus then we can open with a word of

[41:21] always I always like to preach from The
[41:23] Book of
[41:25] Genesis you know why I love the book so
[41:28] much is is because the devil hates
[41:31] it the prophet tells us that there are
[41:34] two books that the devil hates so
[41:37] much the Book of
[41:39] Genesis because it shows things the way
[41:42] they were before we we
[41:45] fell and he also hates the Book of
[41:48] Revelations because it shows his final
[41:52] destination that's the reason why I like

[42:20] father and his
[42:22] mother and shall cleave unto his wife
[42:25] and the twain shall become one
[42:37] the Book of Esther 2:1
[42:39] [Music]
[42:40] 15 it reads now when the turn of Esther
[42:44] the daughter of abeh the uncle of modai
[42:47] who had been taken for his daughter was
[42:50] come to go in unto the king she required
[42:54] nothing but what her guy the king's ch

[46:14] the
[46:18] pastors Andor
[46:20] James for making it
[46:23] possible for me to stand
[46:25] here you know it really means a
[46:29] lot when they can trust a young man who
[46:31] is
[46:35] unmarried who is
[46:37] unstable as Paul
[46:40] says Thou shalt not appoint anyone of an
[46:44] office to be a
[46:47] bishop because young men are not
[46:50] stable one minute they are here in
[46:53] Uganda the next thing they get a job in
[46:55] the United States and
[46:58] so if you make them a pastor of a
[47:00] church be rest assured that they are
[47:02] going to leave you
[47:04] behind so it really means a lot for them
[47:07] to trust
[47:09] me and give me an opportunity to stand
[47:12] here I'd like to also thank and extend
[47:15] warm regards from Pastor
[47:19] bu who also made it
[47:23] possible and decided not to hug the gift
[47:25] to himself
[47:28] but decided to share it with the bride
[47:29] of
[47:30] Christ for the edification of his
[47:33] body and above all I would like to thank
[47:35] my
[47:39] pastor he sends his very warm
[47:42] greetings all the way from
[47:45] Zimbabwe you see it really means a lot
[47:48] as
[47:48] well for him to trust me to fly all the
[47:52] way from
[47:54] Zimbabwe to come here without a patron
[47:58] to look after
[48:00] me he says the young man might
[48:03] fall but he trusted me to be a
[48:06] representative of the lighthouse
[48:10] burner it's a
[48:12] privilege hallelujah hallelujah we give
[48:15] God a CL
[48:16] offering may we give God a clip
[48:22] offering without wasting much of our
[48:25] time we are getting right into the word
[48:27] of
[48:29] God hallelujah hallelujah if there is
[48:32] one thing that I'm kindly asking of
[48:34] you please may you give me your
[48:38] amens let the place feels like a
[48:42] Mor F like a
[48:46] m
[48:47] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[48:51] hallelujah praise God
[48:53] Amen so we have read here in the Book of
[48:58] Genesis and we find
[49:01] out that it is God who instituted
[49:05] marriage marriage was not brought about
[49:07] by any
[49:09] man it was God
[49:11] himself that's why the devil hated so
[49:15] much that's why he fighted so much
[49:18] because it was an original plan of
[49:20] God before even men
[49:23] fell God said and the twain shall become
[49:26] one flesh
[49:28] one might say that was after men had
[49:32] fallen but this is before men had
[49:35] fallen that God said now a man shall C
[49:39] unto his
[49:42] wife he shall leave his father and his
[49:46] mother and them two shall become one
[49:50] flesh then we also read in the Book of
[49:53] Esther where we find out that it was in
[49:56] the time that Jerusalem had
[49:59] [Applause]
[50:01] sied it was under the
[50:04] king that one of the
[50:07] days you see as we shall find out
[50:10] later that there was a queen who used to
[50:13] be
[50:14] there but this queen was against the
[50:17] very law of marriage
[50:19] itself boed to make sure that she get
[50:23] replaced and that's when we see a young
[50:26] girl coming
[50:28] in and Es coming onto the
[50:31] scene and taking the place of
[50:36] v and we've read again in the book of
[50:39] second
[50:40] Peter and we've heard that he's telling
[50:42] the Bride of CH the
[50:44] church that you should add onto these
[50:48] virtues on to your Christian
[50:51] faith got to
[50:55] Virtue you have got to and
[50:57] kindness and long suffering and patience
[51:01] and all those
[51:03] seven hallelujah hallelujah my message
[51:07] tonight is the mystery of the
[51:12] Bride hidden throughout the
[51:15] ages now being
[51:19] revealed and a subtopic or
[51:22] [Music]
[51:23] subheading I would like to call it the
[51:25] bride
[51:28] the mystery of Christ
[51:31] revealed hallelujah hallelujah in my
[51:35] inspiration I got it from Christ The
[51:37] Mystery of God
[51:39] reveal you see Christ is the mystery of
[51:42] God
[51:44] revealed but also the bride is the
[51:46] mystery of Christ
[51:49] revealed because remember it say the
[51:51] twain shall become one
[51:54] flesh and when God created
[51:58] was a part of
[52:00] him but there came a
[52:02] time when God had to take a part out of
[52:06] Adam and form a woman called
[52:09] Eve now the prophet in the message
[52:11] called
[52:12] leadership he tells us that the the kind
[52:15] of a woman that a man
[52:17] marries is a reflection of who he is how
[52:21] many believe that
[52:22] tonight if you marry a sex
[52:25] Queen that just shows what is on your
[52:28] heart now we find that this bride in
[52:31] this
[52:32] hour is the bride that was chosen by
[52:34] Christ
[52:35] himself so the condition of the
[52:38] Bride is a revelation of what is in
[52:42] Christ because Eve was just an
[52:46] extension that came out of Adam I want
[52:50] us to move along this
[52:52] thought and let us not forget this that
[52:56] a woman
[52:57] is an extension of a
[52:59] husband a woman is a revelation of who
[53:03] the husband
[53:05] is hallelujah hallelujah if you see a
[53:08] woman in the streets
[53:09] there wearing a pair of
[53:12] shorts it show no
[53:15] doubt that the father is home
[53:18] drunk because you can easily see by the
[53:21] wife the condition that is at home
[53:24] praise God hallelujah hallelujah
[53:27] hallelujah now we want to move to move
[53:30] forward remember I said the bride is the
[53:32] mystery of Christ
[53:35] revealed it has been the mystery of the
[53:37] Bride that has been hidden throughout
[53:38] all the
[53:41] ages you see the prophet tells us that
[53:45] when you read the word of God from
[53:47] Genesis to
[53:48] Revelations and do not find
[53:51] Christ go back and read it again and I
[53:54] want to tell you this morning
[53:57] that wheresoever Christ is spoken
[53:59] of his bride is identified there with
[54:03] him as Eve was identified with
[54:06] Adam so is the bride of Christ
[54:08] identified with Christ
[54:10] himself when you read from
[54:13] Genesis all the way down to
[54:16] Revelations and do not see your
[54:18] name if you are the bride of
[54:21] Christ go back and read it again because
[54:24] it's the mystery of the Bride
[54:27] that has been hidden throughout all the
[54:29] ages and now is being
[54:32] revealed praise God hallelujah now we
[54:35] are going to look at different
[54:37] examples where we find the the Bible
[54:42] showing us exactly what was going to
[54:45] be the Old Testament is a reflection of
[54:47] the New Testament is a
[54:50] shadow so whatsoever was there in the
[54:52] Old
[54:53] Testament is a representation of what is
[54:57] now hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[55:00] Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah uh before we
[55:04] go in further I want to read to read a
[55:06] quotation from the message the marriage
[55:09] of the
[55:11] Lamb that was pre
[55:15] 6212 you see it says from paragraph
[55:19] 95 and then the
[55:22] ceremony and that's when the bride takes
[55:24] the bridegroom's name
[55:31] she is no more than of her own
[55:35] name she takes the bridegroom's
[55:38] name in other words she becomes one with
[55:40] the with the
[55:41] groom and then when the church has the
[55:47] ceremony makes their
[55:49] promise then she takes the bridegroom's
[55:52] name then she is no longer a church of
[55:55] the world
[55:58] of the world she is the Church of the
[56:00] Lord Jesus
[56:01] Christ amen not I don't mean by that by
[56:07] name I mean that by
[56:10] birth by
[56:12] Nature the power of God by the revealed
[56:16] truth of
[56:17] God in the heart she becomes a
[56:21] Christian the great Universal Apostolic
[56:25] Church
[56:28] when she becomes the part of
[56:31] Christ when she does that Christ injects
[56:35] into
[56:36] her his own spirit and his own life the
[56:42] Bible said So Adam and Eve there you are
[56:47] no longer
[56:48] Twain but one and when the woman the
[56:52] church is married to
[56:55] Christ are no longer two they are one
[56:59] Christ in you amen and this also says
[57:03] here in Christ the Myster of God
[57:07] R he is the principal theme of the
[57:09] entire
[57:11] Bible if you read the Bible and do not
[57:13] see
[57:14] Christ in every verse of
[57:17] it go back and read it again see if you
[57:22] can see Christ in every verse in the
[57:25] Bible then you read it again because you
[57:29] missed
[57:30] something the Bible is
[57:33] Christ he is the word when you read in
[57:37] the beginning God
[57:39] created there is
[57:42] Christ
[57:44] every from that to
[57:47] Amen in
[57:49] Revelation is every word testifying of
[57:52] the Lord Jesus
[57:54] Christ now I want to take you a bit
[57:56] further in the same Book of
[57:59] Genesis as we go into the Book of
[58:01] Genesis chap
[58:03] 24 there there was a
[58:06] man of the name
[58:08] Abraham he was now old and of
[58:12] age hallelujah hallelujah and after a
[58:15] long time after he had
[58:17] waited for the promise of a son
[58:21] to finally the son
[58:23] came and after he had grown to to be a
[58:26] mature
[58:27] man the father thought to
[58:30] himself I must find myself my son's a
[58:36] wife but I'm not just going to find any
[58:39] wife because
[58:41] remember the type of a woman the man
[58:45] marries is the representation of who the
[58:48] man
[58:49] is so now
[58:51] Abraham calls one of his most trusted
[58:55] servants
[58:56] I am going to be to be comparing
[58:59] this with the bride of Christ
[59:02] today now he takes one of his most
[59:04] important
[59:06] servants the most
[59:09] trusted this reminds me of God Jesus
[59:11] Christ
[59:13] himself wanting to search for a
[59:15] bride but what he does now he does not
[59:19] just go to any
[59:21] Bride for a very Trusted
[59:24] Man by the name elaz
[59:27] in our day we
[59:28] have who is none other than the prophet
[59:32] William very trusted by God
[59:35] himself a man that never drank nor
[59:39] smoked nor defiled himself in any
[59:42] way he was surely a trusted man you
[59:46] realize that even Luther when he was a
[59:48] messenger he would smoke a
[59:51] pipe but it was different with
[59:54] elaz the level of the proph that we have
[59:57] received is different from any other
[1:00:00] Prophet hallelujah praise God how many
[1:00:03] believe that so now Abraham goes to
[1:00:07] elaz he says El my
[1:00:10] friend I have something that I want you
[1:00:12] to do for me but before you do this I
[1:00:17] want you to come here and take your
[1:00:19] right
[1:00:20] hand put it under my
[1:00:22] thigh now a
[1:00:24] th resembles a hidden
[1:00:27] place it's not something that you just
[1:00:30] find out
[1:00:31] there it's a hidden part of a man's
[1:00:34] body in other words
[1:00:36] abam was telling
[1:00:39] elaz come forth so that I give you the
[1:00:44] mystery of the Bride I want you to get
[1:00:46] for my
[1:00:47] life hallelujah praise God it is only a
[1:00:52] prophet who gets to see the better parts
[1:00:54] of God's life that's why even when Moses
[1:00:57] was not
[1:00:59] there when the world was
[1:01:01] created he says in the
[1:01:03] beginning but the prophet that we have
[1:01:07] went before Genesis
[1:01:09] 1 says let us examine
[1:01:12] God 400 million years before there was
[1:01:16] any
[1:01:17] creation says in his
[1:01:20] mind God got
[1:01:22] lonely and then he said in his mind let
[1:01:26] us make men in our own image it is only
[1:01:30] a prophet that can put his
[1:01:34] hand under the thigh of God himself
[1:01:39] that's why one time
[1:01:40] Moses he said to God I want to see the
[1:01:44] back
[1:01:45] parts and God showed him the back Parts
[1:01:49] he showed him the hidden
[1:01:51] things he showed him the
[1:01:54] mystery so we find him
[1:01:57] elaz being given the mystery of who the
[1:02:01] bride of Christ is supposed to be oh
[1:02:05] praise God hallelujah you glad that you
[1:02:07] are the bright
[1:02:09] tonight glory to
[1:02:11] God now he put his hand
[1:02:15] behind of Abraham he says swear to me
[1:02:20] that you will not get for my
[1:02:22] son a wife from out there go to my
[1:02:27] people people where I come
[1:02:29] from when Christ is coming for a
[1:02:32] bride he's coming for a bride with the
[1:02:35] same
[1:02:36] blood he's coming to the bride with the
[1:02:38] same
[1:02:39] nature he is not going to look for a
[1:02:43] denominational that sits under a
[1:02:45] denominational
[1:02:46] teaching that and allows women to
[1:02:50] preach but he's going to find himself a
[1:02:53] bride that is called by his name
[1:02:56] that is standing in his expressed
[1:02:59] image so now when
[1:03:02] goes Abraham gives him of the
[1:03:06] right to take any of the treasures that
[1:03:09] he
[1:03:10] had that's why in our
[1:03:12] day all the Mysteries and the Loose
[1:03:16] Ends that were left All Through the
[1:03:18] Ages Willam Mar BR was given the
[1:03:23] privilege to take all of the treasure
[1:03:27] the mystery of God and take it with him
[1:03:31] to go and find
[1:03:33] himself hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:03:36] Amen how wonderful is our God how
[1:03:40] wonderful is this message of the hour it
[1:03:42] is filled with
[1:03:44] Mysteries the Hidden
[1:03:46] Treasures of the kingdom of God so now
[1:03:50] you find out elaz takes the
[1:03:53] wealth then he goes
[1:03:56] after he goes there he gets to a city
[1:04:00] and it's evening
[1:04:02] time hallelujah hallelujah the prophet
[1:04:05] says we are in an evening time but in
[1:04:09] the evening time they shall
[1:04:12] be praise God the bride was
[1:04:16] called by an evening
[1:04:20] message the bride was
[1:04:22] called by a sunsetting message
[1:04:27] oh hallelujah
[1:04:28] praise that's why
[1:04:30] elaz gets there the time of of
[1:04:34] dusk when the sun was going down and he
[1:04:37] makes a prayer and he says
[1:04:40] God if you I will only find
[1:04:44] favor and if you have favor to my
[1:04:48] master please give me good
[1:04:50] spe and he said in his
[1:04:53] mind in his prayer
[1:04:56] in the absence of
[1:04:57] Rebeca he said if a woman is to come
[1:05:01] here give me
[1:05:03] water and also give water to my
[1:05:09] camels she is the one I want you to
[1:05:12] notice when Rebecca
[1:05:15] came only as for water for
[1:05:17] himself he did not speak anything about
[1:05:20] the
[1:05:21] C hallelujah praise but remember it
[1:05:24] takes a bride
[1:05:27] to reveal who Christ
[1:05:29] is so a bride has got a
[1:05:32] mystery that is written in
[1:05:35] her that she can know the mind of
[1:05:38] God she can hear the unspoken
[1:05:42] part the bride was
[1:05:44] called by an unspoken part the bride was
[1:05:49] called by an unrevealed
[1:05:53] mystery it was revealed to her
[1:05:57] that Not only was he supposed to
[1:05:59] give but also he
[1:06:01] coming Hallelujah pra and Rebecca did
[1:06:06] that and elaz was convinced that's why
[1:06:09] when the prophet Comes The Mystery of
[1:06:12] the seven seal is not just revealed to
[1:06:15] anyone it is revealed in the bride it is
[1:06:19] revealed to you and to me that's why
[1:06:22] Christ had one time
[1:06:23] said to you it is
[1:06:26] given to understand of the
[1:06:28] Mysteries and of the hiden things of God
[1:06:32] so it had to take an evening
[1:06:34] PR to catch the mystery of God reminds
[1:06:38] me of Abel in the Garden of
[1:06:40] Eden it was by
[1:06:43] Revelation that he got know true
[1:06:46] worship hallelujah praise God praise God
[1:06:50] Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God
[1:06:54] now when she she did that El was
[1:06:58] sure that this is indeed the
[1:07:01] bride hallelujah praise God oh isn't he
[1:07:06] wonderful hallelujah hallu we're going
[1:07:09] to read the quotation
[1:07:10] here praise God from the message the
[1:07:14] seventh
[1:07:16] seal paragraph
[1:07:20] 393 it says but there will
[1:07:23] be seven voices
[1:07:26] of these
[1:07:27] Thunders that will reveal the great
[1:07:30] Revelation at that
[1:07:33] time this
[1:07:35] time so I
[1:07:37] believe to us the prophet is
[1:07:41] saying if we don't know
[1:07:44] it if it won't be known till that
[1:07:48] time but it will be revealed in that
[1:07:51] day in that hour that it's supposed to
[1:07:55] be revealed
[1:07:57] so the thing for us is to be reverent
[1:08:00] before God and to serve him and do all
[1:08:05] that we know and live good Christian
[1:08:07] lives
[1:08:08] here now we find that the Sixth Seal has
[1:08:11] been open to
[1:08:12] us we see it and we know that the
[1:08:18] seventh seal cannot be broke to the
[1:08:23] public does not say cannot be broken to
[1:08:25] the church or to the bride of
[1:08:27] Christ he says to the
[1:08:30] public it's an unspoken
[1:08:33] part just like in the time of
[1:08:35] elz when he had unspoken
[1:08:38] part the bride of Christ read between
[1:08:41] the
[1:08:42] letters as the BL of Christ will do
[1:08:45] today between the letters to find they
[1:08:49] in the Seven
[1:08:50] Seals in the seven seal the calling out
[1:08:54] of your name in the seven seal the
[1:08:57] revelation of who Jesus Christ is to us
[1:09:00] we know because it is given to us
[1:09:03] because it is by his
[1:09:06] nature that we can know his
[1:09:08] Mysteries remember he said you go to my
[1:09:12] people get for me a bride there not a
[1:09:16] denominational
[1:09:18] bride that's why the prophet was told
[1:09:21] Thou shalt not teach the spiritual
[1:09:23] things to this
[1:09:26] people to this denominational
[1:09:28] baby so this mystery is not revealed to
[1:09:32] the public but it is revealed to the
[1:09:35] bride of Christ hallelujah praise God
[1:09:39] remember we say it's the
[1:09:40] mystery of the
[1:09:43] Bride that has been hidden throughout
[1:09:46] the
[1:09:47] ages hallelujah hallelujah it is in the
[1:09:51] evening
[1:09:52] message that the bride is called
[1:09:55] Rebecca has got the
[1:09:57] ability to hear the unspoken
[1:10:01] mystery that is revealed in
[1:10:04] her hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:10:07] that's why you realize when you
[1:10:10] read the book of Malachi 4 says behold I
[1:10:14] sent you
[1:10:15] Elijah it does not say behold I sent you
[1:10:17] William
[1:10:19] Bren but how did we get to
[1:10:22] know that it was William Bram
[1:10:26] how did we get to know that the
[1:10:29] messenger being spoken of in
[1:10:31] Revelations in zear chter 4 is none
[1:10:35] other than the prophet it was by
[1:10:39] Revelation these things cannot be
[1:10:41] revealed to anyone else but only to the
[1:10:44] bride of Christ that's why when you were
[1:10:47] told that there is a
[1:10:49] messenger In This Very hour you did not
[1:10:52] doubt it in your
[1:10:53] heart unlike your brothers are like your
[1:10:57] sisters you believed it anyhow without
[1:11:01] even the evidence to prove
[1:11:03] it something in you told you that this
[1:11:06] is nothing but the truth and you say in
[1:11:09] your heart I am going to follow this
[1:11:12] message it's a mystery that can only be
[1:11:16] revealed to the bride of Christ
[1:11:20] hallelujah hallelujah the bride of
[1:11:22] Christ is called under a
[1:11:26] seal and it says there was silence in
[1:11:30] heaven the space of half an hour that's
[1:11:34] all there is to it but we have Malachi 4
[1:11:38] is saying at that
[1:11:39] moment God was calling out your name and
[1:11:43] he was calling out my name in The
[1:11:46] Silence the bride is
[1:11:48] called by a silent
[1:11:51] Ser hallelujah hallelujah and he goes on
[1:11:54] to for
[1:11:56] bride that has not been
[1:12:00] tainted by denominational
[1:12:03] doctrines hallelujah hallelujah as you
[1:12:06] go on I want you to realize and find
[1:12:10] out that after they done
[1:12:12] everything and Rebecca was now supposed
[1:12:15] to
[1:12:15] come but the clothes that she put
[1:12:18] on and the Jewel that she put on she did
[1:12:23] not look for
[1:12:24] herself was given to her
[1:12:27] by because Ela is the one who
[1:12:30] knew the secret and the
[1:12:33] Mystery what the blood of Christ was
[1:12:36] supposed to be hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:39] praise God that's why we have a prophet
[1:12:42] on the you come and tell you that you
[1:12:46] have got to be filled with the Holy
[1:12:47] Ghost or else you are not going into
[1:12:50] the that's why he had to come and tell
[1:12:52] you that without perfect love
[1:12:55] there is no rupture for you that's why
[1:12:58] he had to come and tell you that as I
[1:13:00] went beyond the C of time I saw young
[1:13:04] boys and young
[1:13:05] girls and it was told to me that some of
[1:13:09] these people you L them to Christ when
[1:13:12] they were past
[1:13:13] 8 it is the prophet of the
[1:13:16] hour who knows the mystery of what the
[1:13:20] bride of Christ is to Hallelujah praise
[1:13:24] it is given
[1:13:26] to know the kind of Rob that she must
[1:13:28] put on my brother you don't just put on
[1:13:31] any
[1:13:32] rob you don't just believe any message
[1:13:36] that's why we do not follow after
[1:13:38] T that's why we do not follow after
[1:13:41] T because that's not our
[1:13:44] garment the W garment that we put on can

[1:16:32] go into the message Jezebel
[1:16:37] religion paragraph 100 it says when God
[1:16:41] sends forth a
[1:16:42] message and tells the people and they
[1:16:44] don't believe
[1:16:45] it then he withdraws his servant and

[1:17:17] you just can't wait long and cry to hear
[1:17:19] the word of
[1:17:21] God the Bible said
[1:17:23] so there will be a femine in the last
[1:17:27] days said the prophet not for bread and
[1:17:31] water
[1:17:33] alone but for hearing of the true word
[1:17:35] of
[1:17:36] God but that will that voice will be
[1:17:40] quiet in the wilderness hiding
[1:17:44] somewhere
[1:17:46] away hallelujah hallelujah that's why in
[1:17:49] the desert of
[1:17:51] Kentucky the message of the
[1:17:53] hour
[1:17:55] somewhere and it was a time of
[1:17:58] drought it was there was femine in the
[1:18:01] Land There was in great
[1:18:04] need for the word to be
[1:18:07] restored that's the time the bride is
[1:18:10] called in the time of feminine
[1:18:12] H hallelujah praise now we find that
[1:18:16] there was a
[1:18:17] Ruth Ruth is a Fel
[1:18:21] word what does five stand for five stand
[1:18:24] for
[1:18:25] Grace five is the number of
[1:18:28] Grace is called under
[1:18:31] grace because by
[1:18:33] right she was not
[1:18:37] supposed to be a part of the children of
[1:18:41] Israel because he was a
[1:18:43] gentile but it's by
[1:18:45] Grace it's by
[1:18:48] Naomi that Ruth comes into the
[1:18:50] sea hallelujah it's by
[1:18:53] grace that the Bride of Christ comes
[1:18:55] into the
[1:18:56] seene oh hallelujah praise God praise
[1:19:00] God
[1:19:00] Amen now
[1:19:02] Ruth she did not know
[1:19:05] anything about there being a Kingsman
[1:19:08] Redeemer but it was
[1:19:11] Nomi who had the
[1:19:13] secret who had seen the B parts of God's
[1:19:18] mind was Naomi who knew that they back
[1:19:23] home was a
[1:19:26] messenger he knew that back home there
[1:19:29] was a Kingman
[1:19:32] Redeemer
[1:19:34] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the
[1:19:37] mystery of redemption
[1:19:40] of was held by
[1:19:42] Naomi the same way the mystery of the
[1:19:44] Redemption of
[1:19:46] Rebecca was held by
[1:19:49] El is the mystery of the
[1:19:52] Bride that has been hid throughout all
[1:19:54] the
[1:19:56] we are reading now we find that it is
[1:20:00] exactly a reflection of what the bread
[1:20:02] of Christ Jes hallelujah hallelujah now
[1:20:06] Naomi tried to tell them to go
[1:20:09] back after they had walked with her for
[1:20:12] some that's why the prophet tells us
[1:20:16] that the Lutheran yes they walked with
[1:20:18] him but they got to a certain
[1:20:21] point when they
[1:20:23] denominated and
[1:20:26] like they returned back to that mother
[1:20:29] of
[1:20:30] churches where they had come from
[1:20:33] hallelujah hallelujah the bride of
[1:20:36] Christ was there the same time with
[1:20:39] her she did not go back she said I will
[1:20:43] not go back I will go with
[1:20:46] the there I will also go where thou
[1:20:51] sleepest there I will also sleep you see
[1:20:54] the tells us an
[1:20:56] explain says when Copus and
[1:20:59] theop cop and
[1:21:02] theopus and
[1:21:04] theopus
[1:21:05] theopus were
[1:21:07] going they were speaking about
[1:21:10] Christ right there he
[1:21:13] appeared but they go to a certain
[1:21:15] place and the prophet says Christ likes
[1:21:18] to do this he likes to act as though
[1:21:20] he's passing by he's just waiting for
[1:21:23] you to invite
[1:21:25] and it says that's the greatest decision
[1:21:27] that they
[1:21:28] made when they invited him
[1:21:31] in hallelujah praise godu hallelujah
[1:21:35] hallelujah because God will test
[1:21:37] you on your
[1:21:40] profession on your
[1:21:42] testimony you say you are the bride of
[1:21:45] Christ you say I'm picking up my cross
[1:21:47] to follow
[1:21:48] Christ say liketh and Naomi we are going
[1:21:51] with
[1:21:51] you but there sometime God will throw a
[1:21:55] pit there to see what you will do if you
[1:21:59] are the true bride of Christ you will
[1:22:02] say like Ruth whe thou goest I will go
[1:22:07] whe
[1:22:08] thouest I
[1:22:10] willu went on to say something say where
[1:22:14] you
[1:22:15] die I will also die that's the problem
[1:22:18] with the bright T the bride does not
[1:22:21] want to die to their Human Nature
[1:22:26] what the bride needs is a dying
[1:22:30] out and she says where you will be
[1:22:34] buried where will I be buried where are
[1:22:37] we buried bride of Christ we are buried
[1:22:40] in
[1:22:41] Christ where do we die we die in
[1:22:46] Christ so Ruth quot the
[1:22:48] Revelation that for me to go with
[1:22:51] Naomi I have got to die to my selfish
[1:22:56] that's why we read in the book of second
[1:22:58] Peter say put on these
[1:23:01] virtues virtues can only come my
[1:23:05] brother when you die out
[1:23:07] yourself when you are still in your
[1:23:09] human nature there is no perfect love
[1:23:13] when you're still in your human nature
[1:23:15] there's no brotherly kindness so you got
[1:23:18] to die for you to be
[1:23:21] identified with with him had to die to
[1:23:26] be
[1:23:27] identified with Naomi Oh Glory to God
[1:23:32] like the Methodist they
[1:23:34] denominated and they went back like but
[1:23:39] Ruth like Peter where else can we go
[1:23:42] Lord you alone have got
[1:23:45] the out there there is nothing else
[1:23:48] but David
[1:23:52] says the rock where I stand
[1:23:56] That Rock of
[1:23:57] Ages the ground out
[1:23:59] there
[1:24:01] sinking there is only one place where
[1:24:04] you can stand is when you are buried
[1:24:07] under that
[1:24:09] rock was saying I want to be buried
[1:24:11] under that
[1:24:13] Ro
[1:24:16] Naomi
[1:24:17] Grace Naomi represents
[1:24:21] Grace hallelujah hallelujah but truth
[1:24:24] was
[1:24:26] steast and then
[1:24:29] Naomi let
[1:24:31] come hallelujah hallelujah and I want
[1:24:34] you to
[1:24:35] watch the season in which Ruth
[1:24:38] came the season in which Ruth was
[1:24:41] called it says now
[1:24:44] Naomi heard that the
[1:24:47] Lord remembered his
[1:24:49] people and had given them
[1:24:53] Harvest and given them bread and had
[1:24:57] given them B what does bread and b stand
[1:25:01] for for the word of God so when she was
[1:25:05] there the denomination day she heard
[1:25:08] that God had restored the word she that

[1:25:17] and she purpos
[1:25:18] in that I am going the bride is
[1:25:23] called time of

[1:25:46] the B the bread has been restored in the
[1:25:51] hallelujah praise
[1:25:52] God represents the
[1:25:55] word b represents the
[1:25:58] word and who brings the word it than the

[1:26:06] mind of

[1:41:07] husband Hallelujah when you read the
[1:41:10] Bible in the Book of Romans chapter
[1:41:13] 7 Romans chapter 7 in First Corinthians

[1:41:37] spoken in the seventh chapter of
[1:41:39] Romans in the seventh chapter of First
[1:41:43] Corinthians question is why seven
[1:41:48] remember that woman at the well when she
[1:41:51] went to the
[1:41:52] well and met with Jesus he told her go
[1:41:57] and get your husband she said I have no
[1:42:00] husband said you have answered correctly
[1:42:03] you have five and the one that you
[1:42:05] living with the sixth one is
[1:42:09] not but six is an incomplete
[1:42:13] number there's got to be a seventh
[1:42:15] husband
[1:42:16] somewhere that's why we find the law of
[1:42:20] the first
[1:42:21] husband dies on the seventh child
[1:42:24] when the seventh husband comes on the
[1:42:26] seene hallelujah praise God Jesus Christ

[1:43:13] the seventh
[1:43:14] City the Lord Jesus Christ when you die
[1:43:18] to the
[1:43:19] law of your first
[1:43:21] husband then you get the privilege to
[1:43:25] partake of the
[1:43:26] wealth of the seventh
[1:43:29] husband that's why church when you are
[1:43:32] not yet dead to
[1:43:33] yourself forget about the mysteries of
[1:43:36] God forget about the hidden thoughts of
[1:43:39] God because you are no part of it it is
[1:43:43] only when you die to your first
[1:43:47] husband that the message is

[2:07:52] in verse
[2:07:53] 10 all the
[2:07:55] princes seven of
[2:07:58] them from Paul
[2:08:01] Willam the seventh Angel's
[2:08:05] message pronounces the
[2:08:08] Judgment now of the
[2:08:11] prin there was a seventh
[2:08:14] prince who name was
[2:08:18] mean and when you read mean
[2:08:22] is a seven letter
[2:08:24] name and the prophet says
[2:08:27] never from
[2:08:29] Abraham did God ever call and use a man
[2:08:33] with seven
[2:08:35] letters except in the seven
[2:08:40] Church except the seventh
[2:08:43] messenger name
[2:08:44] was who really represents
[2:08:48] William who has seven letter names in
[2:08:51] the seventh age on the seventh day of
[2:08:54] the feast she will come and preach the
[2:08:58] message
[2:08:59] Indi and give
[2:09:02] judgment to that Jezebel
[2:09:04] religion and say
[2:09:06] judgment struck the West
[2:09:10] Coast it's the message of
[2:09:12] mean that brings about the Judgment of
[2:09:15] jeel that brings about the Judgment of
[2:09:18] that foolish
[2:09:19] woman some them can stood up
[2:09:22] said King you know if we let this
[2:09:25] go all the women are going to take
[2:09:28] example and there's going to be an
[2:09:31] uprising and women shall rule over
[2:09:34] us she says it is better now that
[2:09:40] you replace
[2:09:43] her another
[2:09:45] in hallelujah hallelujah praise God with
[2:09:49] another in state
[2:09:52] praise God
[2:09:53] hallelujah hallelujah so the message
[2:09:55] shows that in prison
[2:09:57] now glory to
[2:10:00] God from paragra
[2:10:04] 300 it says oh
[2:10:06] listen all those who rejected the
[2:10:08] message of the
[2:10:10] hour before doomed gospel was preached
[2:10:13] to the
[2:10:16] doomed before they went without
[2:10:20] Mery without Mercy
[2:10:24] Mercy no shut
[2:10:27] up was a
[2:10:28] testimony God shut the door after his
[2:10:33] PO after the third po at
[2:10:40] Sodom the door was
[2:10:42] shut there was no
[2:10:45] Morey the 10 couldn't be
[2:10:48] found and the L the gospel preached
[2:10:52] that could not be
[2:10:54] saved because it was
[2:10:57] just being that way in every
[2:11:01] age every age reject the
[2:11:05] messenger before the
[2:11:07] judgments that's why we have a
[2:11:09] m who comes on the scene and has got
