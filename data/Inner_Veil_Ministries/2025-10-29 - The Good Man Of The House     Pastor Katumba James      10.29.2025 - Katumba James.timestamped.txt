[18:57] need, you can just raise it to your
[18:59] hand. Your hands up.
[19:01] Let us pray. Our heavenly father, we
[19:05] want to thank you so much, Lord. It's
[19:08] our confession this evening Lord that
[19:11] our faith looks unto you Lord
[19:15] lamb of Calvary.
[19:18] You are our savior divine
[19:21] and you said all has been paid.
[19:25] Everything has been finished.
[19:28] Our salvation is finished. All our deeds
[19:31] are finished. Our troubles are finished.
[19:35] Our debts are finished.
[19:37] our sickness is finished. And so,
[19:40] Father, we lift our faith unto you,
[19:43] Lord.
[19:45] That Father, beneath our hearts that
[19:46] we've raised,
[19:49] may you hear our needs, Lord.
[19:52] May you answer our needs heavenly father
[19:55] that you may grant every heart's desire
[19:57] Lord
[19:59] tonight heavenly father that none of us
[20:02] heavenly father
[20:05] may leave this place when we are lacking
[20:07] Lord but rather we may be fully given of
[20:10] all that we have need
[20:13] that we may be in position to rejoice
[20:16] even as you told us in your word
[20:20] that ask that your joy we may be
[20:22] complete.
[20:23] May you Lord answer all our prayers.
[20:27] We commit this service into your hands
[20:30] calling upon the name of the Lord that
[20:32] you may come and speak to us. You may
[20:35] come and encourage us Lord and show us
[20:38] the path that we have to take. We
[20:41] earnestly depend on you dear Lord and
[20:44] call upon the name of our Lord Jesus
[20:46] Christ. Lifting all the burdens and
[20:49] needs of many brothers and sisters
[20:52] who are not able to come here today that
[20:55] Lord you may reach out to them and touch
[20:59] them heavenly father. We pray for our
[21:01] sister Mary Lord. We pray for her full
[21:04] recovery in the name of Jesus.
[21:07] praying that father you may put her back
[21:09] to good health in the name of Jesus
[21:12] that your mercies may be upon her life.
[21:16] We also praying for our pastor. Praying
[21:18] that you may also strengthen him Lord.
[21:21] And father grant your healing upon him
[21:24] to make him give him good health. Lord
[21:26] Jesus

[21:30] him heavenly.
[21:32] Lift all the burdens of the children of
[21:34] God into your heart that you may bless
[21:37] us all together Lord and may we rejoice
[21:40] in your presence Lord.
[21:43] In the name of the Lord Jesus who grant
[21:45] us this.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Let us go to the book
[21:50] of Luke,
[21:52] &gt;&gt; chapter 12.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; We're reading verse 39 and verse 14.
[22:01] [Music]
[22:03] Verse 39.
[22:06] Verse 39.
[22:13] And then verse 40. So the Bible says
[22:16] &gt;&gt; and this know that if the good man of
[22:19] the house had known what hour the thief
[22:22] would come, he would have watched and
[22:26] not have suffered his house to be broken
[22:29] through.
[22:34] [Music]
[22:48] Be ye therefore ready also, for the Son
[22:51] of Man comes at an hour when you think
[22:56] not.
[23:03] May God sing of his word.
[23:06] I want to preach on the sub. You may be
[23:08] seated. I want to preach on the subject.
[23:13] The good man of the house.
[23:17] Now the good man of the house
[23:21] is actually the householder.
[23:24] Praise the name of our Lord. He's the
[23:27] master of the house.
[23:29] And then here the Lord is telling us
[23:33] this man has his house
[23:36] and it is his responsibility
[23:40] to keep security of his house.
[23:43] And then he says,
[23:45] &gt;&gt; "If the good man
[23:48] had watched over his house,
[23:54] he wouldn't have allowed the thief
[23:58] to just come in and break the house."
[24:02] And then here the Lord relates this to
[24:04] his second coming,
[24:08] you know, calling us to be, you know,
[24:10] awake or alert all the time.
[24:16] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[24:18] we are living in challenging times.
[24:22] We are living at the time of the coming
[24:24] of the Lord.
[24:27] Praise the name of our Lord. As we are
[24:29] living at the time of the coming of the
[24:31] Lord Jesus Christ,
[24:35] it calls us to be vigilant.
[24:39] You know, you need to see that you are
[24:41] watchful
[24:44] because there are so many things that
[24:46] are taking place. Now,
[24:48] when the coming of the Lord is at hand,
[24:53] we need to see that we are watchful.
[24:57] see that you take interest in the things
[25:00] of God.
[25:03] Be involved in the things of God.
[25:06] Be meditating upon the things of God.
[25:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Now today I
[25:13] just want to take a different direction
[25:17] you know from what we seem to have read
[25:21] in the scripture
[25:24] and identify the good man of this house.
[25:27] Now
[25:31] as faith
[25:33] praise the name of our lord. Now in the
[25:35] message the physical realm
[25:51] it says well that's the same thing that
[25:54] takes place
[25:57] when a demon is cast out
[26:01] of a sick person.
[26:04] The first few days
[26:06] he says, "Oh, I feel wonderful."
[26:10] Then he begin to say, "I'm sicker than I
[26:14] was ever.
[26:18] I've lost my healing."
[26:21] Just as sure as faith took it out.
[26:33] Unbelief
[26:35] brings it right back again.
[26:40] As faith kills it,
[26:47] unbelief resurrects it.
[26:52] Jesus said, "When the unclean spirit is
[26:55] gone out of a man,
[27:01] he walks in dry places
[27:06] and he returns back with seven other
[27:09] devils.
[27:13] And if the good man of the house
[27:18] is not standing there to protect that
[27:21] door,
[27:24] he the demon will come right on
[27:29] and the good man of your house
[27:33] is your faith.
[27:35] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. So he
[27:37] says the good man of the house
[27:42] is faith.
[27:44] So now we as the habitation
[27:49] we need to have the good man
[27:53] which is faith. You make sure that your
[27:56] faith in God
[28:00] is not affected by the circumstances
[28:02] that you go through.
[28:07] Make sure that your faith in God
[28:10] does not go down.
[28:13] Because once your faith goes down,
[28:17] then you let demons to come in
[28:21] because unbelief
[28:23] opens doors for evil spirits.
[28:28] So now you need to see that the good
[28:30] man,
[28:33] the good man of your house,
[28:36] the good man of your heart
[28:39] which is faith
[28:42] is strong inside of you.
[28:45] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[28:47] says,
[28:49] "But now you watch
[28:52] a patient that is healed.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Ordinarily it is an outstanding miracle
[29:02] which divine healing and a miracle is
[29:04] two different things.
[29:11] You know a miracle is something that
[29:14] happens
[29:17] praise the name of our Lord. But then
[29:19] divine healing
[29:22] can take time.
[29:25] Praise the name of our Lord can take
[29:27] time. The way you use medicine to get
[29:29] healed.
[29:31] So even divine healing can take time.
[29:35] But it is the power of God working upon
[29:38] your life.
[29:40] But a miracle is something that happens
[29:42] all of a sudden and then it is there.
[29:47] And you know God uses all.
[29:50] It is his sovereign grace
[29:53] that it can be a miracle.
[29:56] You know like somebody may have maybe go
[30:00] and then it just disappears.
[30:03] Then somebody may have go
[30:07] and then now immediately the the life of
[30:10] go leaves
[30:14] but then the thing is still swollen
[30:17] and then after maybe 3 days it is out.
[30:22] Then he says here divine healing is one
[30:25] thing and a miracle is another thing.
[30:31] But anyone of divine healing
[30:40] when the unclean spirit is cast out
[30:45] a cancer devil
[30:52] when it leaves the person.
[30:55] Now we will take something you can say
[30:57] maybe visual.
[31:03] Let us say cataract
[31:05] [Music]
[31:07] I don't know how they call it but this
[31:08] is something which covers the eyes
[31:14] what happened when that man
[31:18] if you'll notice if you'll notice a
[31:21] blind person
[31:24] because cataract makes the eyes blind
[31:32] I'm just forgetting the name. So now
[31:35] what he's saying when that life of that
[31:38] cataract leaves
[31:43] after 3 days
[31:46] this immediately the person can see as
[31:48] if they they watched they are seeing.
[31:52] But now that growth
[31:56] the growth you know the the the
[31:59] substance which covered the eyes
[32:03] it takes some bit of time to be
[32:05] dissolved
[32:08] like when the bloodream is moving around
[32:13] it picks up that dead substance
[32:18] and then it makes the person become
[32:20] sicker.
[32:24] and then he can start saying ah I never
[32:26] got healed in the first place
[32:30] but yet that demon has already been cast
[32:33] out
[32:35] but now he starts following his symptoms
[32:39] I'm feeling sick
[32:42] so that's what brother Brham said your
[32:45] faith killed the disease
[32:49] but now when you start saying I'm not
[32:51] healed
[32:54] then the demon is ready to come back.
[32:58] So that's why your good man,
[33:01] the faith that is in you
[33:05] has to be kept there
[33:08] has to be strong
[33:10] that even when such circumstances come
[33:16] you know you can stand firm
[33:20] now our salvation
[33:22] because the Bible tells us that the just
[33:26] shall live by faith.
[33:29] Praise the name of the Lord. So now your
[33:32] faith
[33:34] is what makes you saved.
[33:38] Praise the name of the Lord. Your faith
[33:40] in God
[33:42] is what saves you. But if you don't have
[33:46] faith in God,
[33:49] then you cannot be, you know, overcome
[33:52] that situation.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So now when
[33:57] you put faith aside
[34:01] then you find that you even lose your
[34:03] salvation.
[34:07] So even our healing
[34:11] our healing is as long as our faith
[34:14] stands.
[34:22] But now when your faith goes away,
[34:26] then you lose your healing.
[34:30] Praise the name of the Lord. Now in
[34:32] Ephesians chapter 2.
[34:36] And then verse 8.
[34:39] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[34:41] Bible says, "For by grace are you saved
[34:45] through faith
[34:47] and that not of yourself. It is the gift
[34:49] of God.
[34:59] So now when you lose faith
[35:02] in your confession,
[35:06] praise the name of our Lord, then you
[35:08] know that you are failing.
[35:11] You are going off. So that's why it is
[35:14] important for us
[35:17] to keep the good man of the house.
[35:21] Your faith should not go down regardless
[35:24] of what you're going through
[35:28] because faith
[35:30] is the foundation.
[35:33] And the Bible tells us without faith it
[35:37] is impossible to please God.
[35:41] So you need to see that your faith
[35:44] is not put down by any circumstance.
[35:49] Even when you pray and it seems you're
[35:51] not being answered,
[35:55] you need to keep on believing.
[35:58] Keep on having faith.
[36:01] Don't look at the conditions you're
[36:03] going through. You don't look at the
[36:06] symptoms you're going through. You don't
[36:08] look at the situations around you.
[36:12] But you know, you must have faith.
[36:15] Praise the name of our Lord. knowing
[36:18] whom you have believed.
[36:21] The apostle says I know whom I have
[36:24] believed that is more than able to take
[36:26] me through.
[36:29] Praise the name of our lord. Now in the
[36:31] message expectation
[36:34] he says let us conduct ourselves
[36:37] women
[36:39] don't be like the world.
[36:42] Don't dress like the world.
[36:45] Don't be these modern things
[36:52] and all this stuff that they are doing.
[36:56] Keep away from it. You are a daughter of
[37:00] a king.
[37:03] Gentlemen,
[37:05] you brethren,
[37:07] you don't have to beat down and be
[37:09] pushed off the corner. You are sons of
[37:11] the king.
[37:17] Stand up.
[37:20] Throw out your chest. Meet it.
[37:23] We are expecting God to do something for
[37:25] us.
[37:28] He can't do nothing for us.
[37:31] When we are just dropping around like we
[37:35] or something half dead,
[37:40] he wants a lively church.
[37:44] He wants the members in there to be
[37:46] livelessly stones
[37:50] built up in the house of faith.
[37:55] Believe him.
[37:57] Accept him
[37:59] taking his word.
[38:02] Praise the name of our Lord.
[38:04] Now our life on earth here
[38:09] as children of God, the Bible tells us
[38:12] we should walk by faith
[38:17] and not by sight,
[38:19] not what we see, but you know, you walk
[38:22] by faith.
[38:25] What does the word of God require me to
[38:27] do?
[38:30] Praise the name of our Lord. That should
[38:32] be our confession.
[38:35] Your testimony,
[38:37] you know, your heart's desire every day.
[38:41] Lord, let me do something that is
[38:43] pleasing unto you.
[38:46] Lord, let me fulfill your will for my
[38:48] life.
[38:50] And then you continually seek the face
[38:53] of the Lord
[38:55] depending upon the Lord to help you in
[38:59] everything that you go through.
[39:02] We as children of God, we walk by faith
[39:06] and not by sign. And then you also need
[39:09] to know the things that God has promised
[39:13] to us.
[39:15] The real things, the eternal things
[39:19] are not seen.
[39:22] They are actually taken by faith.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[39:29] the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter
[39:32] 4
[39:35] and then verse 18.
[39:42] Why we look not at the things which are
[39:44] seen but at the things which are not
[39:47] seen. For the things which are seen are
[39:50] temporary but the things which are not
[39:52] seen are eternal.
[40:03] Praise the name of our Lord. So our
[40:06] faith,
[40:07] our Christian walk
[40:10] is to look at the things that are not
[40:14] seen.
[40:16] [Music]
[40:17] And you know, you look at the promise of
[40:19] God.
[40:21] What has the Lord promised me?
[40:25] Then you look at that which the Lord has
[40:27] given to us.
[40:30] So you are not walking by feeling.
[40:35] You know even healing.
[40:38] You don't just start feeling then you
[40:40] say now I think I'm going to be healed.
[40:43] But then you need to have faith and
[40:46] believe God who has given the promise
[40:51] that is more than able to make the my
[40:53] healing come to pass
[40:57] or even whatever need that we have
[41:01] and then you say Lord
[41:03] this is my need
[41:06] Lord this is my heart's desire
[41:08] and then you believe God to make it come
[41:11] to us.
[41:13] Praise the name of our Lord. In the
[41:15] message, faith is our victory.
[41:19] He says, "If you if you need
[41:23] any need whatsoever
[41:27] that God has promised in his Bible,
[41:33] he's here tonight
[41:35] to meet that need."
[41:39] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[41:41] sometimes you hear something and as if
[41:44] it is just like a a story.
[41:50] Ah that one is is far away from me.
[41:53] But you know the word is telling us that
[41:57] whatever God has promised
[42:01] he's there tonight
[42:04] to meet that need.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[42:09] says no need seeking father
[42:17] when the giver is here.
[42:23] Praise the name of our lord. You know
[42:25] this is the man with a job.
[42:28] Then you say let me first go home.
[42:31] But we have met the person who can give
[42:32] you the job.
[42:35] You know this is the physician.
[42:37] Then you say, "Let me first go maybe to
[42:40] the forest and pick some herbs."
[42:43] When you have met the physician
[42:47] and you know faith should be able to
[42:50] declare
[42:52] in the present tense,
[42:54] [Music]
[42:55] praise the name of our Lord. You know
[42:57] the Bible says, let us speak that in
[43:00] Mark chapter 12.
[43:04] Praise the name of our Lord.
[43:07] It is something that the scripture
[43:09] discares as it has already been done.
[43:15] He has already done it.
[43:18] Praise the name of our Lord.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; So in the book of Mark,
[43:25] it's actually chapter 11. He says in
[43:28] verse 22,
[43:31] &gt;&gt; "And Jesus answering says unto them,
[43:35] have faith in God."
[43:39] Mark 11:22,
[43:45] For I say unto you,
[43:49] whosoever shall say to this mountain,
[43:53] Be removed, and be thou cast
[43:58] into the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[44:02] heart, but shall believe that those
[44:06] things which he says
[44:09] shall come to pass. He shall have what
[44:12] he saith.
[44:29] Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever
[44:32] things you desire
[44:35] when you pray, believe that you receive
[44:39] them, and you shall have them.
[44:42] [Music]
[44:53] Praise the name of our Lord that takes
[44:56] care of all our needs.
[44:59] So all your need
[45:02] it is a promise of God. He says
[45:05] whatsoever
[45:07] you desire.
[45:11] So the whole thing is your desire.
[45:16] You make it known to the Lord
[45:20] and say Lord
[45:23] this is my request
[45:25] and you know our needs keep on changing
[45:30] in the morning I may be afraid to meet
[45:33] my boss.
[45:35] Then I pray Lord help me to find favor
[45:37] before my boss
[45:39] and God answers it. Maybe when I'm at a
[45:42] place of work, when I'm at a place of
[45:45] work, there's also another issue that
[45:48] comes and troubles me.
[45:51] Then I put it before the Lord.
[45:53] Maybe the day is ending
[45:56] and I don't have any money for supper.
[46:00] Then I put it before the Lord. You know,
[46:03] at any time
[46:06] we can make our requests known to the
[46:09] Lord.
[46:11] And then you believe God
[46:14] because here it is a promise. It's an
[46:17] open check.
[46:22] You know, you can put what you need in
[46:24] that check.
[46:26] Lord, this is what I need.
[46:30] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[46:33] says, believe that you receive it and
[46:38] then you shall have it.
[46:40] And when you believe that you are
[46:41] receiving,
[46:44] &gt;&gt; you know, your mind is just thankful.
[46:46] You are expecting any time to come.
[46:50] When God promised Abraham a son,
[46:55] brother demonstrates it.
[46:58] Abraham went and started buying no
[47:00] children's clothes.
[47:04] Praise the name of our Lord LIKE
[47:06] EXPECTING PARENTS.
[47:09] YOU KNOW nowadays they go to the scans
[47:14] and then they scan what is the the sex
[47:16] of the child
[47:20] and then if it is a female they try to
[47:23] look for colors for girls
[47:26] [Music]
[47:29] then they prepare and put them there.
[47:34] we get light blue and things like that
[47:38] in expectation.
[47:41] So then he says here if whatever you
[47:44] desire
[47:46] when you pray
[47:48] believe that you receive them
[47:52] so you make preparations for it.
[47:56] Praise the name of our Lord. YOU MAKE
[47:58] PREPARATION
[47:59] THAT I'M going to receive this. Praise
[48:02] the name of our Lord. That's what
[48:04] Abraham was doing. He was making
[48:06] preparation.
[48:08] Our child is coming. Where is the child
[48:11] going to be? How are we going to keep
[48:13] the child? What plans have we made for
[48:16] the child? You are in expectation.
[48:20] So even
[48:22] praise the name of our Lord. You get in
[48:24] expectation.
[48:26] Praise the name of our Lord. You've
[48:28] prayed for a job. You must be in
[48:31] expectation
[48:33] which will be my first clothes on the
[48:35] day of I start working.
[48:39] Praise the name of the Lord. You're in
[48:41] expectations.
[48:42] Your heart has already moved ahead.
[48:46] Praise the name of the Lord. What kind
[48:48] of expectation?
[48:50] Oh, I'm praying God to give me a car.
[48:53] Where will I be parking my car?
[48:57] Praise the name of the Lord. YOU MAY NOT
[48:59] HAVE EVEN BUILT ANYTHING but you know
[49:01] you believing God for something.
[49:05] Praise the name of our Lord. Like our
[49:08] pastor has an interesting testimony.
[49:12] He said when they were living in a small
[49:15] small room
[49:18] you know he would draw building plans of
[49:20] what he wants to build.
[49:24] He says our house is going to be like
[49:26] this.
[49:28] He's not waiting to have the money,
[49:31] but you know, you've already moved into
[49:33] what you are praying to God.
[49:37] Praise the name of our Lord. That shows
[49:39] you are believing that it's going to
[49:40] come.
[49:43] I'm going to have this then you start in
[49:46] that world.
[49:48] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[49:50] Abraham was moving.
[49:53] You know like a job even when he says
[49:58] praise the name of our Lord he saw his
[50:00] sickness
[50:02] how he was so much in affliction
[50:05] but he had a promise that even if this
[50:09] skin worms destroyed this flesh
[50:13] yet in this same body I'm going to see
[50:16] my redeemer.
[50:18] Praise the name of our Lord. He was
[50:20] looking beyond the circumstances he was
[50:23] going through.
[50:25] And I should do the same thing with us.
[50:28] I should look beyond my salary
[50:32] for the things I want to do. I should
[50:34] look beyond my education,
[50:37] for the job I want to apply for.
[50:40] I should look beyond my business,
[50:44] my capital, for the things I want to do.
[50:48] Why? I'm believing in God who is more
[50:52] than able to make to pass that which I
[50:54] have requested.
[50:57] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[50:59] faith is a substance.
[51:02] It's a reality
[51:04] that this is going to pass.
[51:08] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[51:10] how we need to live as children of God.
[51:13] what you have need of. You pray to the
[51:16] Lord and SAY, "LORD, THIS IS MY NEED."
[51:20] Praise the name of our Lord. I'm not
[51:22] depending upon my ability,
[51:25] but I'm depending upon the ability of
[51:28] God.
[51:30] I'm depending upon the promise of God.
[51:34] Praise the name of our Lord. That's what
[51:36] brother Brandham is telling us. That if
[51:38] God has promised it in his Bible,
[51:43] here tonight
[51:45] to meet the need.
[51:48] Praise the name of our Lord. His
[51:50] presence is here.
[51:52] His spirit is here and he is willing
[51:57] and ready
[52:00] and longing
[52:04] to give you what so what you were
[52:07] seeking for.
[52:11] Why would you wait any longer?
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Those things are not mine. When you're
[52:20] afraid to take the promises of God,
[52:24] you will not come out.
[52:27] Like when Jesus had fished the whole
[52:29] night,
[52:32] they struggled the whole night.
[52:35] The weather maybe was not good. Maybe
[52:38] the moonlight or the light were not
[52:40] good.
[52:42] I said
[52:45] we got then Jesus comes through there
[52:50] but we s the whole night.
[52:54] We need to leave that lamentation first.
[52:58] Lord, I've tried several times
[53:05] but out
[53:09] Now when they launched out
[53:12] what they got
[53:14] even the nets were not able to pull all
[53:16] of it
[53:19] and that's what the Lord does
[53:22] when you can only depend upon him.
[53:25] Lord you're more than able to handle
[53:27] this I'm
[53:30] praise the name of the Lord. Lord, you
[53:32] can help me in the circumstance I'm in.
[53:35] Because the Lord knows what we are going
[53:37] through and he's here to help us. Praise
[53:41] the name of our Lord. He's here to give
[53:43] you grace
[53:45] to meet your need.
[53:48] Praise the name of our Lord. So then
[53:50] brother Brham says when you come to him
[53:55] don't come as a floater.
[54:09] I'll go up
[54:14] and try it and see if it works. It's not
[54:18] about that. Just have faith in God.
[54:23] Lord, this is my heart's desire.
[54:27] You know the Bible says whosoever comes
[54:30] to God
[54:33] must believe that God is real.
[54:38] Praise the name of the Lord. You just
[54:40] have that in your life.
[54:42] Lord, you are real.
[54:45] Praise the name of the Lord.
[54:47] Like let me let us put it in the natural
[54:49] way.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Like now you see you find the president
[54:54] of Uganda has come
[54:59] or maybe he has come to your house.
[55:02] What a great honor to host the president
[55:06] and then he asks you
[55:09] what can I do for you?
[55:16] And you say but the president will
[55:18] manage my problems. Can you imagine
[55:21] that?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Your house is leaking but even after
[55:25] your house leaks
[55:28] you see where the house is.
[55:31] You see the road is bad.
[55:34] My car is broken down. My business the
[55:38] taxes are too high.
[55:40] capital.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; He just only writes
[55:45] the Bank of Uganda, the Uganda
[55:48] Development Bank
[55:50] just gives instruction
[55:53] and things work out. How about our God?
[56:04] But that's that's how we get ourselves
[56:06] caught up.
[56:08] You suffer with your problem.
[56:11] You get troubled the whole day.
[56:15] And then Jesus tells you,
[56:18] "Why do you think about your troubles?
[56:22] If you cannot add on your hair,
[56:29] then why trouble about tomorrow?"
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. He says,
[56:35] "Cast all your burdens away
[56:39] and the Lord cares." Praise the name of
[56:42] our Lord. It's actually a step of faith
[56:47] and then you commit to the Lord this
[56:49] deed.
[56:50] You commit the Lord this burden
[56:53] and don't be tired of asking the Lord.
[56:58] Praise the name of our Lord. So then he
[57:00] says, "You'll never get nowhere.
[57:06] You know you are just trying try and
[57:09] error maybe it will work maybe it will
[57:11] not work
[57:14] but then you must come with assurance
[57:18] that if I present this before the Lord
[57:22] the Lord will hear my prayer the Lord
[57:24] will answer my need.
[57:27] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[57:29] says, "But when you come with this kind
[57:31] of a determination
[57:35] that you have sold out,
[57:39] you know, when you are tired of the
[57:42] world and sin and unbelief,
[57:50] frustrations and doubt
[57:56] and come to the living God.
[57:59] with anchor
[58:03] surely tightened in the rock of ages.
[58:09] The Holy Spirit is here to pull you into
[58:11] the presence of the living God
[58:17] that will give you a faith
[58:20] that will overcome
[58:24] anything there is in the world.
[58:29] sickness, disease and even death itself.
[58:35] You say,
[58:36] &gt;&gt; you said death,
[58:38] &gt;&gt; brother Brenham.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; That is what I meant to
[58:43] praise the name of anything because it's
[58:47] in the promises of God.
[58:50] whatever you have need of
[58:53] and then the Lord. Praise the name of
[58:55] the Lord answers your prayers.
[58:58] So the question is what do you have need
[59:01] of?
[59:04] Praise the name of our Lord. You just
[59:05] mention it to the Lord.
[59:08] Praise the name of our Lord and say Lord
[59:11] this is my heart.
[59:14] Lord this is what I'm lacking.
[59:17] And we have different needs. Your need
[59:20] may not be my need.
[59:22] Praise the name of Lord. My need may be
[59:24] completely different. And for you are
[59:26] saying why is he asking such a thing?
[59:31] But that is my that's what I feel I need
[59:35] like the little children. He can ask you
[59:37] for a toy
[59:40] then even this one here. But that is
[59:43] their
[59:46] feel it matters a lot to them.
[59:49] Praise the name of our Lord. How about
[59:51] our heavenly father?
[59:54] Praise the name of our Lord. The great
[59:56] of the universe
[59:58] all the heaven and the earth and said
[1:00:01] ask
[1:00:03] and you can't ask too much that God
[1:00:05] cannot give
[1:00:08] because how will you have a mind to ask
[1:00:09] more than what he can give?
[1:00:13] Praise the name of our Lord. So he is
[1:00:16] more than able to give us what we have
[1:00:18] need of.
[1:00:21] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[1:00:23] to see that we have faith in God
[1:00:28] and make sure that you don't allow doubt
[1:00:31] to come in.
[1:00:35] Praise the name of the Lord. Now in Mark
[1:00:38] 12
[1:00:40] and then verse 43
[1:00:46] When the unclean spirit is gone out of a
[1:00:48] man, he walks through dry places seeking
[1:00:52] rest and finds none.
[1:01:07] Then he says, I will return unto my
[1:01:10] house from whence I came out. And when
[1:01:13] he is come, he findeth it empty, swept,
[1:01:18] and garnished.
[1:01:34] Now
[1:01:36] we need to see that our houses
[1:01:40] are occupied by the good man of the
[1:01:43] house.
[1:01:46] When your house is empty,
[1:01:50] it's an attraction to evil spirits.
[1:01:55] wrong spirits to come and take charge
[1:01:57] over your life.
[1:02:01] In the book of Psalms, the scripture
[1:02:03] says, "I have hid your word in my heart
[1:02:09] that I may not sin against you." So you
[1:02:12] make sure that your house is not empty.
[1:02:18] Let the good man of the house be there.
[1:02:23] He is the keeper of the house.
[1:02:26] And when he is right there,
[1:02:29] praise the name of our Lord, when the
[1:02:31] evil spirits come,
[1:02:34] they'll not be able to enter in.
[1:02:37] But now when your house is empty,
[1:02:40] then evil spirits can come.
[1:02:43] And then the Bible says you he comes
[1:02:46] with worse demons. Seven worse demons
[1:02:53] more wicked than him
[1:02:56] and then they enter there and then they
[1:02:59] dwell there
[1:03:01] because Satan is looking for a place to
[1:03:04] hide himself.
[1:03:07] So you don't give room to Satan
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; to come and find a position in your
[1:03:14] life.
[1:03:16] You know there are some things that take
[1:03:18] our attention away from the word of God.
[1:03:23] Maybe the programs that we watch,
[1:03:27] you know, programs, videos,
[1:03:31] videos,
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; you know, maybe this kind of movie
[1:03:35] or maybe this kind of thing I watch on
[1:03:37] my phone
[1:03:39] or my computer.
[1:03:42] All those avenues for demons to enter
[1:03:45] into your life.
[1:03:49] You know when you watch something wrong
[1:03:54] it will certainly impact in your life
[1:03:59] there is some kind of evil that you will
[1:04:02] partake from what you watch.
[1:04:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Now if just
[1:04:10] looking at a naked woman is itself
[1:04:13] obscene or something which is tempting.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; How about watching something funny
[1:04:27] you take your time. So you are feeding
[1:04:31] you feeding. You are feeding. So what
[1:04:34] you are getting from here
[1:04:38] is actually entering into your heart
[1:04:41] and at the end of the day you start
[1:04:42] manifesting the dirt things you are
[1:04:44] feeding from
[1:04:48] the things you are hearing.
[1:04:50] So now you've opened room for demons,
[1:04:54] spirits that can take a hold of your
[1:04:56] life
[1:04:58] and then you find that the good master
[1:05:00] of the house
[1:05:03] cannot be in that kind of place.
[1:05:06] Praise the name of the Lord because
[1:05:08] faith comes by hearing
[1:05:11] and hearing by the word of God.
[1:05:15] So instead of taking time on the word of
[1:05:17] God,
[1:05:19] you are taking time on contrary things.
[1:05:24] So you cannot have enough faith
[1:05:27] to help you walk this Christian walk.
[1:05:32] So the devil just comes in
[1:05:35] and then he changes your thinking.
[1:05:38] He changes your behavior.
[1:05:40] He changes your speech and then you find
[1:05:43] that you're doing things which are not
[1:05:45] right.
[1:05:47] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:05:49] book of second Peter chapter 2
[1:05:54] and then verse 20
[1:05:57] the Bible says for if after they have
[1:06:00] escaped the pollutions of the world
[1:06:03] through the knowledge of the Lord and
[1:06:05] Savior Jesus Christ they are again
[1:06:09] entangled therein
[1:06:12] and overcome. The latter end is worse
[1:06:16] with them than the beginning.
[1:06:27] Yes,
[1:06:50] For it had been better for them not to
[1:06:53] have known the way of righteousness than
[1:06:56] after they have known it to turn from
[1:06:58] the holy commandment delivered unto
[1:07:01] them.
[1:07:18] But it is happened unto them, according
[1:07:21] to the true proverb, the dog is turned
[1:07:24] to his own vomit again, and the soul
[1:07:27] that was washed to her wallowing in the
[1:07:37] Ed.
[1:07:54] Now he says, "If we live the way of
[1:07:57] righteousness
[1:08:00] and then go back to the things which are
[1:08:02] wrong,
[1:08:04] the condition becomes worse.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; You find you are entangled into the
[1:08:11] things that you overcame.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; So then even your condition becomes
[1:08:17] worse.
[1:08:20] Praise the name of our Lord. But the
[1:08:22] Bible tells us we are not of them
[1:08:26] who turn back. Praise the name of our
[1:08:29] Lord. for as we move forward.
[1:08:32] Praise the name of our Lord. We have the
[1:08:34] promise of God.
[1:08:36] Like Paul says, I'm pressing
[1:08:41] for the to the mark of the high calling
[1:08:42] of God.
[1:08:44] Our promise right now,
[1:08:47] the great expectation we have in our day
[1:08:51] is the change of our bodies. So every
[1:08:54] day we press,
[1:08:56] praise the name of our Lord. It doesn't
[1:08:58] happen today, I'm sure looking for it
[1:09:01] tomorrow.
[1:09:03] Praise the name of our Lord. If it
[1:09:05] doesn't happen this week, I'm sure
[1:09:07] looking for it next week. So, you keep
[1:09:10] on living in expectation.
[1:09:13] As you keep on going, like Abraham, when
[1:09:17] the year passed, he kept on believing
[1:09:20] the Lord.
[1:09:21] got over. He kept on believing on the
[1:09:23] Lord. And then the Bible says he looked
[1:09:27] for a city
[1:09:29] whose builder and maker was God himself.
[1:09:33] Praise the name of our Lord. He wasn't
[1:09:35] tired.
[1:09:37] He knew the city was there. So he kept
[1:09:40] looking for that city. So he also keep
[1:09:43] on trusting in the Lord. Keep on
[1:09:45] depending upon the Lord. Even in your
[1:09:48] weaknesses,
[1:09:50] you don't give up. You keep on
[1:09:52] believing. You keep on believing. Like
[1:09:55] the children of Israel, they were
[1:09:57] waiting for the consolation of Israel.
[1:10:00] So they were keeping on believing. Keep
[1:10:03] on trusting, keep on expecting.
[1:10:07] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[1:10:09] keeps you going.
[1:10:11] Praise the name of our Lord. Even if you
[1:10:13] don't see it in your day, you know it
[1:10:16] sure is going to happen. Praise the name
[1:10:19] of our Lord. Like Joseph, when he was in
[1:10:22] Egypt, he went and told the children of
[1:10:25] Israel that one day God is going to
[1:10:29] visit you and then you're going to go
[1:10:31] back to the land of Hebrew.
[1:10:34] And then he told them, you pack my bones
[1:10:38] and go with them. He was looking at the
[1:10:41] promise of God.
[1:10:43] And there should be the same thing also
[1:10:44] with us. We live in such great
[1:10:47] expectation.
[1:10:49] Lord, I'm longing for your coming. I'm
[1:10:52] looking for the rapture. I'm looking for
[1:10:54] the change of my body. It doesn't matter
[1:10:57] what I'm going through. I'm still
[1:10:59] believing the Lord who has made a
[1:11:02] promise that is able to make it come to
[1:11:04] pass. Praise the name of our Lord. So,
[1:11:07] it gives you a zeal.
[1:11:10] Praise the name of our Lord. You rise up
[1:11:12] in the morning believing God, it's going
[1:11:15] to come to pass. Praise the name of our
[1:11:18] Lord. I'm surely going to make it. I'm
[1:11:21] surely going to overcome this
[1:11:22] circumstance.
[1:11:24] Praise the name of our Lord. So in the
[1:11:26] message, faith is our victory.
[1:11:30] Brother Brham says that is purposing in
[1:11:34] your heart.
[1:11:37] That is really getting to business.
[1:11:41] You know,
[1:11:43] when you get that kind of purpose in
[1:11:46] your heart,
[1:11:49] God is going to open the windows of
[1:11:52] heaven.
[1:11:56] Something has got to take place.
[1:12:00] You've got to get to the business with
[1:12:03] God
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:05] and have some purpose
[1:12:09] and some gratitude for him saving you.
[1:12:16] And when Daniel had purposed in his
[1:12:18] heart
[1:12:24] and the devil made him to prove it,
[1:12:30] But we find out that it it stood good in
[1:12:35] the face of the hungry lion.
[1:12:48] ever comes to God
[1:12:51] and really down in his heart
[1:12:54] finds a settled faith,
[1:13:04] it will stand good
[1:13:08] in the mouth of death
[1:13:12] or in the mouth of sickness,
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; in the mouth of sorrow. sorrow
[1:13:19] to stand good
[1:13:22] for faith is the victory.
[1:13:26] You have to overcome by your faith.
[1:13:30] Praise the name of the Lord. So
[1:13:32] regardless of the challenge,
[1:13:34] you stand firm.
[1:13:37] This is what I'm standing.
[1:13:39] Praise the name of our Lord. I'm
[1:13:41] standing on the promise of God.
[1:13:44] I believe it is true. I believe it is
[1:13:47] correct. Like the three Hebrew children
[1:13:51] when Nebuchadnezzar had made a lot of
[1:13:53] fire
[1:13:55] seven times hotter
[1:13:58] and the Bible says the fire was burning
[1:14:01] the men who were taking them inside.
[1:14:04] But now this was said whether what or
[1:14:07] what we not going to worship your image.
[1:14:12] The good man of the house was strong in
[1:14:16] their lives.
[1:14:17] They had purpose in their life
[1:14:20] regardless of the challenge. Praise the
[1:14:23] name of our Lord. Standing by the word
[1:14:25] of God. And that should also be the same
[1:14:28] thing with us. Take the promise of God.
[1:14:32] Stand by the promise of God. Praise the
[1:14:35] name of our Lord. If there is this
[1:14:37] trouble,
[1:14:39] speak it out. Rebuke the enemy to go
[1:14:42] away.
[1:14:44] Praise the name of our Lord. MAYBE SOME
[1:14:46] SICKNESS. YOU REBUKE THAT SPIRIT.
[1:14:55] Praise the name of our Lord. You just
[1:14:57] say Satan, get away from here.
[1:15:00] You have no right here.
[1:15:04] I'm redeemed of the Lord.
[1:15:06] Praise the name of our Lord. You take
[1:15:08] your stand,
[1:15:10] faith settled,
[1:15:13] you know. THEN YOU TELL SATAN, GET AWAY
[1:15:15] FROM HERE.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And then he
[1:15:19] says, it will stand good in the mouth of
[1:15:22] death
[1:15:24] or in the mouth of sickness,
[1:15:27] in the mouth of sorrow. It will stand
[1:15:30] good. For faith is the victory.
[1:15:35] You have you have overcome by faith.
[1:15:42] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:15:44] how we need to live every day.
[1:15:48] Praise the name of our Lord. You rise up
[1:15:50] in the morning. You are looking at the
[1:15:52] promise of God. You are, you know,
[1:15:55] that's your confession.
[1:15:57] That is your testimony.
[1:15:59] Praise the name of our Lord. And then we
[1:16:01] just keep on going regardless of the
[1:16:04] opposition.
[1:16:08] Praise the name of I believe. Let us
[1:16:10] finish.
[1:16:12] Let us go and pick up this scripture in
[1:16:16] Mark chapter 3.
[1:16:22] And then verse 27.
[1:16:28] H
[1:16:30] the Bible says
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; no man can enter into a strong man's
[1:16:35] house and spoil his goods except he will
[1:16:39] first bind the strong man and then he
[1:16:42] will spoil his house.
[1:16:55] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:16:58] Let the strong man be in your house,
[1:17:03] the good man of the house.
[1:17:06] Faith. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:17:09] then the Bible says without faith, it is
[1:17:13] impossible to please God.
[1:17:16] So your faith in God will bring God
[1:17:20] down.
[1:17:22] Then the Lord dwells in you.
[1:17:25] Tell me how Satan
[1:17:27] Praise the name of the Lord. Like you
[1:17:29] have your house.
[1:17:31] And then you say, I've dedicated this
[1:17:33] house to God.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, you are the Lord of this house.
[1:17:38] Take charge over this house. And you
[1:17:41] know God, he knows what the devil is
[1:17:44] even planning to do.
[1:17:47] Praise the name of God. Before even
[1:17:49] start sending the missiles,
[1:17:52] he knows that at this time of the year,
[1:17:54] this is what the devil is going to do.
[1:17:58] So he's already there prepared.
[1:18:01] I will sat and enter a house where God
[1:18:03] is
[1:18:06] and then steal something
[1:18:08] when God is watching over that house.
[1:18:11] So we need to see that we are the
[1:18:13] habitation of God.
[1:18:17] Let God come and dwell with us.
[1:18:21] The way the Bible says, "Let the word of
[1:18:24] God dwell in you richly."
[1:18:30] Now, if the word is fully in me
[1:18:35] and the thief comes to steal,
[1:18:39] kill and destroy. So when the thief
[1:18:43] comes and the word is right in here,
[1:18:49] the thief will not steal my joy,
[1:18:53] will not steal my peace. Why? The house
[1:18:56] is protected.
[1:18:59] The strong man is there.
[1:19:02] Satan cannot come and bind
[1:19:06] because he's stronger than him.
[1:19:09] Greater is it that is in us.
[1:19:12] than the devil that's in the world.
[1:19:14] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[1:19:16] to see that faith
[1:19:19] is strong in our lives. Praise the name
[1:19:22] of our Lord. Keep on reading the word of
[1:19:24] God. Keep on hearing the word of God.
[1:19:27] Keep on meditating upon the word of God.
[1:19:30] Keep on obeying the word of God. See
[1:19:33] that your faith
[1:19:35] raises up.
[1:19:37] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[1:19:39] promises of God.
[1:19:41] are not far from you or you are not
[1:19:44] ignorant of what the Lord has promised
[1:19:47] in any form of travel. You can bring the
[1:19:50] promise of God in your strength.
[1:19:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Have the
[1:19:56] good man of the house
[1:19:58] richly abiding in your life. Praise the
[1:20:02] name of Lord. Then Satan will not steal
[1:20:05] anything from you. Satan will not
[1:20:07] destroy anything you have.
[1:20:10] It will not take away your peace, will
[1:20:12] not take away your joy, not take away,
[1:20:15] you know, your love for God. Why?
[1:20:18] Because the Lord is abiding.
[1:20:22] Praise the name of our Lord. And nothing
[1:20:24] of your house will be cheated.
[1:20:29] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:20:31] keep the good man of the house,
[1:20:34] our faith. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:20:38] living by faith every other day.
[1:20:41] Praise the name of the Lord. May God
[1:20:43] bless you.
[1:20:45] Amen.
[1:20:48] On Friday, we have an overnight service.
[1:20:52] Then on Sunday, we have two services
[1:20:56] with the Lord's Lord's Supper.
[1:21:01] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us sing
[1:21:03] that song. I'm living by faith.
[1:21:07] Praise the name of our Lord. You don't
[1:21:09] look at what you're going through.
[1:21:12] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:21:15] We live by faith every day.
[1:21:19] God bless you.
[1:21:22] I care not what today the tomorrow may
[1:21:27] bring.
[1:21:28] If shadows or sunshine or rain,
[1:21:35] the Lord I know looked over everything
[1:21:42] and all of my worry is vain. I'm living
[1:21:49] or living by faith
[1:21:54] in Jesus abound.
[1:22:00] Trusting confounding
[1:22:06] in his great love.
[1:22:09] [Applause]
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:13] from all I'm seeing.
[1:22:17] [Music]
[1:22:23] I'm living by faith
[1:22:28] and I feel no alone.
[1:22:32] I feel no alarm. Oh, the tempest made no
[1:22:39] wonder. Storm clouds arise
[1:22:43] oburing
[1:22:45] the brightness of life.
[1:22:50] I'm never
[1:22:53] alone that the overcast
[1:22:57] skies the master looks on the sky.
[1:23:04] I'm living.
[1:23:06] I'm living by faith
[1:23:11] in Jesus.
[1:23:18] Trusting
[1:23:23] in his great love
