[6:56] to appreciate him amen amen so he's one
[7:02] of our new pastors not very dedicated
[7:06] is working in two different localities
[7:10] amen so he writes his motorcycle
[7:14] amen amen preachers
[7:19] then he goes and preaches again in his
[7:22] original Church yeah
[7:27] foreign
[7:40] as we come to church always
[7:44] we just come with an open heart
[7:48] Omega
[7:49] and when the message is coming forth
[7:54] God speaks to every one of us
[7:59] in a different way
[8:01] amen amen he may say to you in a
[8:05] different way
[8:07] and then it speaks to another from the
[8:10] same message a different way
[8:14] so as we teach the message
[8:18] I'm sure that the Lord knows how to
[8:21] distribute it among the peace
[8:24] amen and you remember faith comes by
[8:27] hearing people
[8:29] and hearing by the word of God
[8:34] Amen and when I say by the word of God
[8:38] I'm not saying from the word
[8:42] by the word of God because all of us
[8:46] come from the spoken word
[9:20] church is a very interesting thing
[9:23] the word the Holy Spirit
[9:26] even if you are coming for the first
[9:29] time
[9:33] amen Amina so brother Elijah God bless
[9:36] you
[9:38] I was just checking on this temperature
[9:40] yesterday
[9:43] I think he's doing well
[9:46] I mean so let's stand up up and get into
[9:50] the scripture reading
[9:52] you remember when Jesus was before in
[9:56] Bethlehem of Jordan basically came into
[9:58] Jesus Christ
[10:00] are you together with me so we are
[10:03] really talking about those men this
[10:05] morning
[10:07] amen Matthew chapter 2 verse
[10:11] now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[10:15] Judah yes
[10:18] in the days of Herod the king
[10:22] behold there came wise men from the East
[10:25] to Jerusalem
[10:30] from the East
[10:33] to Jerusalem
[10:36] May the Lord that blessing the reading
[10:39] of Israel
[10:43] the scripture says There came wise men
[10:46] from the East
[11:05] so we are taking foreign
[11:15] from the East a magazine
[11:19] wisdom a magazine from the East
[11:23] that's going to be our title this
[11:26] morning
[11:27] so we need to look at the significance
[11:30] of two things in this scripture
[11:35] wisdom a magazine under the East Andover
[11:40] wisdom a magazine and the East
[11:44] so symbolically
[11:47] the East is associated with falling from
[11:51] the presence of the Lord
[11:54] amen so Genesis chapter four
[11:58] and verse 16.
[12:01] the scripture says and Cain went from
[12:05] the presence of the Lord
[12:08] and drought in the land of Lord
[12:12] on the East of Eden
[12:15] Eden that's the East
[12:17] away from the presence of the Lord
[12:22] now Genesis 13 11.
[12:26] then Lord chose him on the plane of
[12:29] Jordan
[12:32] and Lord Janet East
[12:36] and they separated themselves
[12:39] [Music]
[12:41] the one from the other
[12:45] is separated with Abraham
[12:48] and the scripture says he went
[13:45] you may call it a way of life
[13:50] that lives away from the presence of God
[13:55] and as brother Branham teaches
[13:59] he tells us that civilization
[14:04] began from the East
[14:07] so after Cain moves
[14:11] the Bible says
[14:14] that he started to build modern
[14:17] civilizations
[14:20] amen amen so Genesis 4 17.
[14:25] he built the first city
[14:29] and Genesis 4 21.
[14:33] he was I mean his line
[14:36] started music for entertainment
[14:41] not for worship now
[14:44] but music for entertainment
[14:48] and in Genesis
[15:02] in Genesis chapter four
[15:05] we find that the morals completely were
[15:09] corrupted
[15:12] polygamous
[15:22] because in the lineage of King
[15:26] Genesis chapter 4 verse
[15:36] hear my voice
[15:41] [Music]
[15:50] [Music]
[16:33] [Music]
[16:51] in amen
[17:08] [Applause]
[17:44] [Applause]
[17:44] [Music]
[18:01] [Applause]
[18:29] not that and then you get home
[18:34] and you study how Israel settled around
[18:37] the Tabernacles
[18:41] amen I think we need our lives
[18:45] to settle around the presence
[18:52] amen that whatsoever you did
[18:55] you are mining the presence of God
[18:58] because by faith
[19:01] Israel news
[19:12] they knew they were staying around the
[19:14] presence
[19:16] amen let's go to Genesis chapter numbers
[19:26] [Applause]
[19:31] [Music]
[19:37] shall preach
[19:39] by his standard
[20:06] [Music]
[20:17] foreignty
[20:19] he recognizes
[20:23] he recognize the sovereignty of Judah
[20:27] you have to get away
[20:28] the sovereignty of zebulance
[20:31] the sovereignty of them
[20:34] he respected them according to their own
[20:39] tries
[20:41] and they also had an answer
[21:10] [Applause]
[21:42] you know the tribes of his
[22:15] because this message is related to the
[22:19] sovereignty of that local child
[22:24] and the condition and the level of
[22:27] maturity
[22:29] amen praise the Lord you hear some of
[22:33] the young churches
[22:35] when you go out there you may start
[22:39] saying these Believers
[22:42] the love of God is working with
[23:03] because this is the love of maturity
[23:09] are you together with me so God works
[23:13] uniquely
[23:16] recognizes the existence
[23:20] of the local churches
[23:22] and then he partners with them
[23:27] along that level
[23:29] and then he understands their battles
[23:33] and deals with them to help them win
[23:37] their battles
[23:40] so there are so many local churches
[23:45] [Applause]
[23:51] that has come down in our days uh
[24:00] [Applause]
[24:53] [Applause]
[24:57] their lives was weaved around
[25:00] [Applause]
[25:13] say no just
[25:26] [Applause]
[26:15] by the door exactly
[26:19] God allowed the two special men
[26:23] that was
[26:25] Moses they gathered that door
[26:29] are you together with me yes sir why
[26:34] would God put Moses
[26:37] that's what we are going to find out
[26:40] amen
[26:47] wisdom from the ears
[26:54] he says but those that encamp before the
[26:58] Tabernacle whenever
[27:02] towards the east
[27:04] even before the Tabernacle of the
[27:07] congregation is

[28:00] ministering the entrance
[28:04] to the people that were under the blood
[28:08] are you together with me anybody that's
[28:12] not under the blood
[28:14] in the New Testament is looked at as a
[28:18] stranger
[28:20] that had no right
[28:23] to enter
[28:26] if it was in the days of Moses
[28:31] are you together with me foreign

[55:57] you know
[56:00] foreign
[56:28] [Music]
[56:34] [Music]

[58:11] he was a circled by prostitution
[58:16] drugs
[58:18] nightlife don't go witchcraft
[58:23] the condition was so bad
[58:28] but deep down inside there
[58:31] he knew he had the father
[58:36] you see once you are a child of God
[58:40] even if you fall well the reality to
[58:44] that there is a loving father
[58:48] does not depart from a man's heart yeah
[58:53] the Bible says
[58:55] he kept in the struggles
[58:59] and the Bible says one day he came to
[59:03] himself
[59:07] away from the father's guidance and
[59:10] Leadership
[59:13] but the Bible says he came to himself
[59:17] so wisdom is turning around
[59:22] wisdom magazine is taking the step of
[59:26] justification
[59:28] I'm going to my father he will justify
[59:55] the morning
[59:57] I'm walking this way after a while
[1:00:00] something speaks to me
[1:00:03] that's not where the Bible says and he
[1:00:06] came to himself
[1:00:09] brother Branham says and something
[1:00:12] speaks to me
[1:00:14] and nothing can tell me about God
[1:00:18] I'm turn this away
[1:00:21] when I turn around that's my
[1:00:24] justification
[1:00:27] the pictures my object of going is
[1:00:32] the picture
[1:00:34] so you know he turns around
[1:00:38] instead of going further east
[1:00:44] he stops at a certain point and he says
[1:00:50] I have a loving father
[1:00:53] and then he begins to work
[1:00:56] and the object finally is the loving
[1:01:00] father
[1:01:02] um
[1:01:19] oh
[1:01:29] Lord
[1:01:35] he turns around
[1:01:37] praise God now his objections is just
[1:01:44] Christ
[1:01:46] and where was Christ
[1:01:49] where was the anointing um
[1:01:52] it was way out here in the holy of
[1:01:55] holies
[1:01:58] when they put a bright Road of iron
[1:02:02] it's better than fruited we go

[1:02:09] instead fresh all the time
[1:02:13] when everyone entered there alone there
[1:02:17] was a bright shining lights
[1:02:27] that is our objects
[1:02:29] to get into holy presence
[1:02:33] so that we can return
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:39] amen Amina so wisdom was repentance
[1:02:44] wisdom
[1:02:46] foreign
[1:02:56] so Luke 15 16.
[1:03:00] we are talking about this man in

[1:23:59] of the Stars
[1:24:01] take those messages
[1:24:07] stay under the light of that stuff
[1:24:10] it will guide you to the second coming
[1:24:14] of Christ
[1:24:16] my Ministry
[1:24:20] that is
[1:24:25] but how can we know him unless we are in
[1:24:29] the world
[1:24:32] amen amen so the first major gift
[1:24:36] because
[1:24:38] you know I want you to it was God
[1:24:46] and then frankincense
[1:24:49] service to Jehovah
[1:24:52] and then the last one was
[1:24:55] saying that he's going to die for us
[1:24:59] amen Amina so we need to look at the new
[1:25:03] testament's church
[1:25:10] I want you to follow me very well first
[1:25:16] permanent giftable
[1:25:20] is
[1:25:23] in the beginning of the church
[1:25:29] was the gift of one Apostle Charlie
[1:25:35] and everybody
[1:25:37] wanted to be an apostle
[1:25:40] until the scripture says you checked
[1:25:44] them
[1:25:47] that said that they were Apostles
[1:25:57] it was a great gift
[1:25:59] they wanted to be like a poem
[1:26:04] James amen amen and after that the next
[1:26:10] gift was the Teaching Ministry
[1:26:14] it became so powerful
[1:26:17] Amen in second Peter chapter 2 verse 1.
[1:26:23] there were false prophets
[1:26:26] also among the people
[1:26:37] who privilege shall bringing dominant
[1:26:59] [Applause]
[1:27:03] the apostolic message
[1:27:06] to me foreign
[1:27:48] haha everybody then wanted to be an
[1:27:52] evangelist a
[1:27:58] revengers
[1:28:33] the great missionary that went to India
[1:28:36] in 1773
[1:28:40] Livingston to South Africa
[1:28:43] although some of those great men I got
[1:28:47] names or plenty of them here
[1:28:54] the white man the brown man
[1:28:57] all wars broken down
[1:29:01] and this man went out into Mission
[1:29:04] fields
[1:29:10] evangelists
[1:29:41] to me
[1:29:43] so many of them
[1:29:45] in the beginning of the church
[1:29:49] and then after that comes the teachers
[1:29:52] and then finally come on
[1:29:59] so the last two major gifts is
[1:30:10] hahaha
[1:30:12] standing at the EastEnders
[1:30:15] to bring the people back
[1:30:18] into the presence
[1:30:24] are you together with me Ronnie let us
[1:30:26] look at this you know after the age of
[1:30:30] the open door then
[1:30:33] we just stepped into the edge of the
[1:30:36] restoration
[1:30:38] the age of the Elijah Ministry um
[1:30:45] and you know like Malachi 45 says
[1:30:49] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:30:52] prophets
[1:30:54] before the coming of the great and red
[1:30:57] food of the
[1:31:00] Lords of the fathers to the children
[1:31:05] and hearts of the children to their
[1:31:07] fathers
[1:31:09] I come to Smite the Earth with the curse
[1:31:13] so at the time of this gift
[1:31:17] everybody wanted to be a restaurant
[1:31:23] foreign
[1:31:28] [Applause]
[1:31:47] when brother Branham
[1:31:49] and he had that anointing then everybody
[1:31:52] anointed
[1:31:58] everybody I also have a mentor
[1:32:04] then I know
[1:32:06] listen what is it
[1:32:09] praise the Lord he promised that yes of
[1:32:12] his auntie so that says the Bible just
[1:32:15] exactly this day
[1:32:21] that wasn't a lady that was that was the
[1:32:24] spirit of Elijah
[1:32:26] Elijah was just a man
[1:32:29] now we have heard Elijah this is
[1:32:41] everything
[1:32:42] but the light of this day
[1:32:45] is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:52] after
[1:32:56] [Applause]
[1:33:07] so once you lose that anointing
[1:33:10] I mean you lose that understanding well
[1:33:13] if we went again then you are going to
[1:33:15] kill him to a man to
[1:33:18] but it's an anointing after that came by
[1:33:22] Elijah that is
[1:33:29] that goes to the Jews
[1:33:46] will be the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:51] the ministry of the son of man
[1:33:54] so Saint Luke 17 says
[1:33:58] the son of man is to revealing himself
[1:34:00] among his people
[1:34:06] it will come through a prophet are you
[1:34:10] hearing me he never had two major
[1:34:12] professor at the same time
[1:34:15] amen it has to be one hand
[1:34:19] allowed us to get one man under his
[1:34:22] control
[1:34:23] there's one God there's one father and
[1:34:28] Holy Ghost but one God
[1:34:34] so has he with Elijah
[1:34:37] the spirit of Elijah he used that Spirit
[1:34:41] but the same God controlling
[1:34:44] the time he said to fulfill his wife
[1:34:49] when that anointing came down everybody
[1:35:09] they measure for you
[1:35:18] so
[1:35:19] the last Ministry
[1:35:21] that will stand with this alleged
[1:35:24] anointing
[1:35:25] is the Minister of the past
[1:35:29] to keep the door open
[1:35:33] for the people
[1:35:49] amen amen so the last Ministry now
[1:35:54] is like a twice
[1:35:57] when Moses built the Tabernacles
[1:36:01] and put Amos I mean Aaron and himself
[1:36:07] [Applause]
[1:36:20] that were not coming by my future
[1:36:25] but the prophet of the entire
[1:36:28] the anointing of Christ himself
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:50] to
[1:36:53] the revelation of Christ again
[1:36:59] amen Amina yes sir that's what I'm here
[1:37:02] for wow not to become some big fellow
[1:37:05] man
[1:37:07] to help you back into that Divine
[1:37:11] Fellowship
[1:37:13] amen Amina so all the rest of the body
[1:37:18] must not start
[1:37:20] there is a special Grace
[1:37:23] upon the ministry of the pastor today
[1:37:29] and now when you look around we're
[1:37:31] together everybody who starts
[1:37:35] he also wants to be a pastor
[1:37:40] that's the anointing
[1:37:43] when the anointing fell upon the
[1:37:45] apostles
[1:37:48] went fell upon the teachings everybody
[1:37:53] when it came down evangelists
[1:38:03] but the last four I mean the last
[1:38:07] Ministry anointed
[1:38:09] by you amen amen which is going to be
[1:38:12] murdered in the church
[1:38:14] is the anointing of the past
[1:38:17] standing together with the message
[1:38:25] the revelation of Christ
[1:38:31] when brother Branham says
[1:38:34] don't never leave your church
[1:38:37] stay with your pastor
[1:38:40] he means to stay with the feeding gifts
[1:38:46] not with everybody who claims the
[1:38:49] anointing
[1:38:52] but stay with the feeding gifts
[1:38:56] because the minister of the past
[1:38:59] to feed the people on the revelation of
[1:39:03] Christ
[1:39:04] we must have something from Malachi
[1:39:08] to feed the flock back
[1:39:11] and then a minister that holds the
[1:39:14] people all of them
[1:39:18] holds the people under them
[1:39:23] without a Feeling
[1:39:28] decorated
[1:39:37] you keep the people you've got authority
[1:39:40] over them but you don't feed them
[1:39:48] listen to what brother Branham says
[1:39:51] and I want this church
[1:39:55] when I leave into the ministry here to
[1:39:57] go out into the fields
[1:40:01] I want you to stay with your past
[1:40:05] understanding that teaching that has
[1:40:07] been taught here
[1:40:10] no now is not only saying the pastor
[1:40:15] but the food
[1:40:18] to stay with the kind of food
[1:40:21] stay with this word
[1:40:25] you stay with you stay right with the
[1:40:28] world no matter what comes oh God
[1:40:38] and then it comes down into the Ephesian
[1:40:41] churches
[1:40:43] what have Disney collisions
[1:40:47] the word comes from two Greek words
[1:40:52] which means
[1:40:55] which means
[1:41:02] somebody was doing something in that
[1:41:05] early church
[1:41:08] which was Conquering the people
[1:41:11] if the people were being conquered
[1:41:15] when it had been some Authority
[1:41:20] amen amen so what was it that God hated
[1:41:25] that was happening in the church
[1:41:28] what was going on there and it's now
[1:41:32] going on today is exactly what is the
[1:41:35] word inequality means
[1:41:42] that was absolutely contrary to the
[1:41:45] world
[1:41:52] but what we are here
[1:41:54] is to feed on that word
[1:42:01] believe that message
[1:42:03] take it as you're staying
[1:42:07] amen I mean and so Lord I Thank you for
[1:42:10] the message
[1:42:12] if he's correcting you thank God
[1:42:19] thank God for that because the purpose
[1:42:22] at the end of it
[1:42:24] is to bring you to the Christ
[1:42:27] born in our time
[1:42:30] amen amen wisdom will bring people back
[1:42:33] from the east
[1:42:36] of sin
[1:42:38] to the presence of the anointed
[1:42:42] person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:47] amen Amina so let us identify wisdom
[1:42:50] here
[1:42:51] amen we've seen the east whenever we've
[1:42:54] already identified the Easter symbolic
[1:42:56] of whereas in Texas
[1:43:01] foreign
[1:43:35] because we are coming back through the
[1:43:37] world
[1:43:38] it is saying something to you
[1:43:42] is giving you a robe
[1:43:45] of the world
[1:43:47] producing watts of righteousness
[1:43:50] your work is getting different
[1:43:53] you experience the authority of a God
[1:43:56] over you
[1:43:59] amen so by looking at the three wise men
[1:44:02] because
[1:44:27] traditional religious history
[1:44:36] they
[1:44:39] started looking for him
[1:44:42] where he was not
[1:44:47] they went to the curse of religious men
[1:44:52] where is he born King of the Jews
[1:44:57] stayed away

[1:52:19] one of these days
[1:52:23] there will be a time

[1:55:00] which was the sport that horrible in the
[1:55:03] Lord made
[1:55:05] a covenant with the children of Israel
[1:55:11] when they came out of the land of
[1:55:14] Egyptian
[1:55:17] are you together with me what is it look
[1:55:20] at the word
[1:55:22] that's been put in the Tabernacles
[1:55:27] it was not added with anything
[1:55:31] it was pure child
[1:55:35] he says there was nothing in the ACT
[1:55:38] except for the two tablets
[1:55:42] but in our Ark I am you find this
[1:55:46] Pentecostal things
[1:55:56] and it stops the glory of God
[1:56:02] but there was nothing right
[1:56:06] except for the two tablets of laws
[1:56:10] and it came to pass when the priests
[1:56:13] were come out of the Holy place
[1:56:18] that the cloud filled the house of the
[1:56:22] Lord
[1:56:25] praise the Lord when the priests
[1:56:29] were come out of the Holy place
[1:56:32] that loud filled the house
[1:56:43] could not stand to minister

[1:57:24] no prophets
[1:57:29] no teachers the glory of the Lord will
[1:57:33] just filled the house
[1:57:37] and we are getting into that time
[1:57:40] friends
[1:57:50] when we are coming into the time of
[1:57:54] being caught away
[1:57:57] we shall step into the time of Look Away
[1:58:01] to Jesus
[1:58:05] we shall stop in the time of the squeeze
[1:58:11] time is coming when these churches will
[1:58:14] close

[1:58:23] with the two tablets of law anybody is
[1:58:33] we need to feed now
[1:58:35] that's wisdom is feeding on the world
[1:58:40] for the time we look up when this word
[1:58:43] will not be that freedom
[1:58:47] so there was a seventh seal
[1:58:50] the dedication of the Templeton
[1:58:55] to take over from the ministry
[1:59:01] God comes down
[1:59:06] foreign
[1:59:29] who just came into our pastors uh
[1:59:33] services on Thursday
[1:59:37] he has never been part of it
[1:59:41] but he was you know in a Pentecostal
[1:59:44] world
[1:59:46] and out there his friends were telling
[1:59:50] him
[1:59:55] let's look for people want Power
[2:00:00] so I don't know what that power will
[2:00:03] anointed
[2:00:05] when it comes on thy site
[2:00:08] we are feeding to The Courier because
[2:00:10] the anointing is going to fall
[2:00:15] this is
[2:00:16] we are built ourselves
[2:00:22] and the anointing is coming down
[2:00:29] are you together with me what is it so
[2:00:31] the first coming
[2:00:34] they found Christ in the manger
[2:00:37] that's where the wise men found him
[2:00:40] but in the second coming
[2:00:43] it is
[2:00:45] pulling the seals away from the world
[2:00:49] and unveiling himself
[2:00:52] before usually
[2:01:02] amen amen
[2:01:04] let me take about 10 15 minutes
[2:01:13] he says now
[2:01:16] to him that is the power
[2:01:18] according to establish you according to
[2:01:22] my gospel
[2:01:24] and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[2:01:30] according to the revelation of the
[2:01:32] mystery
[2:01:35] which was Kept Secret since the world
[2:01:38] began
[2:01:42] praise God so the revelation of the
[2:01:45] Mysteries
[2:01:51] which is
[2:01:55] from himself
[2:01:58] making himself known
[2:02:01] this is where the wise men are gathering
[2:02:04] too
[2:02:08] to the revealing of Christ
[2:02:14] in the first coming
[2:02:16] they gathered in the manger
[2:02:19] but now here everything I know they are
[2:02:22] gatherings
[2:02:30] amen Amina but now it's made manifested
[2:02:34] by the scriptures of the prophets
[2:02:38] according to the Commandment of the
[2:02:40] Everlasting God
[2:02:43] known to All Nations
[2:02:45] for The Obedience of Faith
[2:02:48] he is revealing himself
[2:02:51] as John 1 1.
[2:02:55] Hallelujah in the beginning was the
[2:02:58] world
[2:03:00] revealing himself
[2:03:04] [Music]
[2:03:07] the anointed
[2:03:08] [Applause]
[2:03:17] amen Amina he is revealing himself as
[2:03:20] John 1 1.

[2:03:37] take it
[2:03:38] no they know what they are located they
[2:03:42] went into Jerusalem they were mistaken a
[2:03:45] little bit when they were there they
[2:03:49] said this is not what it is
[2:03:59] and today now the wise men have been in
[2:04:03] all this kind of organizations
[2:04:07] and all kinds of teachings but finally
[2:04:12] after the revelation of the world
[2:04:16] revealing the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:04:18] Christ
[2:04:21] making us different there is something
[2:04:24] real evaluation
[2:04:30] so
[2:04:34] that's what it is
[2:04:37] we are sliding into the seventh seal
[2:04:41] today

[2:04:50] and let me tell you right
[2:04:53] there hey you it will be creative power
[2:04:56] right

[2:05:14] of nothing
[2:05:16] allowing us that weakness to experience
[2:05:19] the life of the world
[2:05:25] he created in Genesis
[2:05:36] in the beginning
[2:05:41] but then time came but God gave Moses
[2:05:46] the opportunity
[2:05:47] to use the creative anointing
[2:05:52] foreign
[2:06:17] hahaha
[2:06:18] praise God I said one time here when I
[2:06:22] was teaching
[2:06:23] and I said God has given us the
[2:06:27] authority to create
[2:06:29] and I said you can create your own
[2:06:31] opportunity
[2:06:33] you can create your own job
[2:06:43] he says Pastor I'm creating my job
