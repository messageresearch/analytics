[5:10] [Music]
[5:12] [Applause]
[5:19] my you this
[5:22] morning amen
[5:30] [Music]
[5:55] 11se
[6:02] [Music]
[6:08] amen so the scripture
[6:12] says
[6:13] [Music]
[6:15] now is the substance of things
[6:21] of the of
[6:29] bless the reading of
[6:35] this
[6:42] [Music]
[6:54] fors I think you know
[7:00] that we have seven
[7:03] dimensions we have the original
[7:07] Dimension which is the highest
[7:11] Dimension that's the dimension of God
[7:16] himself
[7:21] ET were
[7:23] angs there was no nothing he existed
[7:30] amen and then after the
[7:34] creation then we've got the
[7:40] ofer and so he to create
[7:44] di
[7:54] will amen and then after that
[7:59] know heated
[8:13] [Music]
[8:30] when
[8:38] [Music]
[8:43] [Applause]
[8:53] created but then we have to
[8:56] know when God created man
[9:08] control
[9:15] [Music]
[9:28] [Music]
[9:32] know the
[9:45] isir that's how he ruled the
[9:49] creation and then when time was
[9:52] come that it was necessary to te the
[9:57] ground then God put
[10:00] man in the
[10:02] dimension amen which all these other
[10:06] human uh creatures were able to live
[10:13] in which is time
[10:26] and amen because naturally in the flesh
[10:32] we deal with
[10:33] matter this is matter
[10:36] here this is
[10:38] matter this man
[10:40] here in the natural
[10:43] body is
[10:45] matter but for me to have a link to
[10:49] him I need
[10:51] light
[10:52] without I cannot be able to deal with
[10:57] matter and now we need
[11:00] time to
[11:02] dictate amen is it so fast that I need
[11:06] to do
[11:07] it so time light and
[11:11] matter are the dimensions where the
[11:13] natural man
[11:16] lives but in this
[11:19] Dimension man
[11:22] fell and when he fell it was
[11:27] necessary that God would still want to
[11:30] deal with
[11:33] man but he cannot deal with him exactly
[11:39] physically amen because he had fallen so
[11:44] he created a dimension of
[11:48] faith that
[11:50] man would deal with God by
[11:55] faith and that's what we still have
[11:59] amen we deal with God by
[12:03] faith that's why the scripture
[12:06] says faith is the
[12:10] substance of things which eyes do not
[12:15] see amen by faith are you Sav are you
[12:21] together with me and you believe it you
[12:25] know eyes cannot declare it
[12:29] cannot
[12:30] declare that you are Sav that's a CH of
[12:35] faith that picks you from your
[12:38] fall connects you back to
[12:41] God the of the Holy
[12:44] Ghost amen so that's a
[12:47] CH now after Adam
[12:51] fell you know God needed a
[12:55] l to come and clean that se
[13:01] out of the human
[13:03] race so when Adam would
[13:06] die God made a
[13:09] way of trying to accomodate
[13:13] man amen he cannot go to
[13:17] hell but yet he needed a total
[13:22] cleansing of the blood of Jesus
[13:25] Christ are you together with me so God
[13:28] allow the sixth
[13:32] Dimension that if you die you go under
[13:36] the
[13:37] altar amen and you wait there until all
[13:42] Redemption is
[13:43] done until all the Brotherhood is done
[13:49] CLE amen so we deal with
[13:53] Dimension so when God gave adam
[13:56] faith that faith
[13:59] would actually be able to touch
[14:03] Dimensions the dimensions of the
[14:08] Unseen for Adam he would touch the
[14:13] dimension of God
[14:15] himself amen that's where the prophets
[14:19] would
[14:20] go and they would say and I
[14:23] saw that's Vision oh and I
[14:27] heard God talk to them so those are
[14:31] images and
[14:34] voices but then the devil
[14:38] also SED through this fourth
[14:42] dimension that through that fourth
[14:45] dimension a
[14:47] witch can be able to talk to the
[14:51] devil a witch can also see
[14:56] Vision which comes from the
[15:06] Dimension
[15:07] Faith
[15:09] deals with
[15:12] Dimensions now I'll speak about
[15:15] faith from the Ang of the
[15:20] chrisan amen yes sir so faith is
[15:24] activated by the Holy Ghost
[15:29] to the seed gen in the
[15:33] heart over things that I cannot
[15:37] see cannot
[15:40] hear have entered into the heart of
[15:44] man the things which God has prepared
[15:48] for them that
[15:50] level so faith is a
[15:54] revelation of the
[15:56] realities that already
[15:59] exist in a
[16:01] dimension which man cannot physically
[16:06] touch and
[16:08] preaching now when a man is
[16:11] preaching he's basically trying to
[16:14] answerer people into those Supernatural
[16:22] promises amen and what you are here
[16:26] for is that Lord help the p
[16:31] so that he can
[16:33] us into that
[16:36] Dimension so that you can touch God this
[16:40] morning that when you go home you can be
[16:44] able to
[16:45] say we have heard from
[16:49] God Amen that's what we are
[16:52] doing
[16:54] preaching is intended to lift you
[16:59] from your natural
[17:02] weaknesses Amen to bring you into the
[17:07] presence of
[17:08] God that you yourself when you get into
[17:12] that presence you may be able to claim
[17:16] from
[17:18] God Amen praise the Lord so you
[17:24] know we preach
[17:26] people you know into the of
[17:30] God Amen to build
[17:35] themselves into you know uh
[17:40] verses that God will be able to to
[17:45] use Amen Let me say something like
[17:49] this when one preaches
[17:53] right the people will build the
[17:57] faith that brings God
[18:01] down and his
[18:03] promises can be able to be
[18:07] accessed but then when the m is handled
[18:14] negatively amen open the
[18:18] people into
[18:24] negative are you together with me yeah
[18:27] when the world is preached
[18:32] right it brings you before
[18:36] God if the word is preached
[18:41] negatively amen it also opens you into
[18:45] the negative
[18:48] Channel
[18:52] soals with
[18:54] dimensions that's why the scripture says
[18:58] the soul that
[19:01] Seth shall die and the
[19:05] soul is designed in such a
[19:09] way that it has operate by one
[19:15] gate amen you either have the Gate of
[19:20] Faith or you have the Gate of
[19:24] doubt that's the way God made man
[19:29] amen he gave him a
[19:32] soul and all of us amen when we are
[19:36] born if you are a child of
[19:39] God there is an
[19:42] element which we call the seed gen of
[19:46] God it's inside the
[19:48] soul but it is
[19:50] [Music]
[19:55] asleep are you together with me it's
[19:58] like the
[20:00] seed that was in the
[20:02] ground at the
[20:04] creation but it was
[20:08] asleep waiting for the light to come
[20:12] forth and then God would
[20:15] command let every seed bring forth of
[20:19] it that was the Awakening of the
[20:22] SE and therefore every seed then would
[20:27] bring forth of its
[20:31] so all of us amen good
[20:35] or amen when we are
[20:39] born you see we are born in let me put
[20:44] it this
[20:45] way let me talk from The Young of the
[20:49] believer the
[20:51] elect when he's
[20:53] born that seed is in
[20:57] there and and that seed always pops a
[21:00] little
[21:03] bit because it's a live
[21:06] seed and then you say why should I
[21:10] smoke you drop the
[21:12] cigarette for about one week and then
[21:16] the flesh here overpowers you you buy
[21:21] another
[21:23] cigarette I know many of you never
[21:27] smoked those control
[21:30] people a man would go and
[21:33] drink that seed would shake
[21:41] up but why do I
[21:44] drink he throws away the
[21:47] bottle after some
[21:49] time
[21:51] that would want the
[21:56] again and then you drink
[21:59] and then you come back home you begin to
[22:04] cry who will save me from this
[22:08] drinking I don't like
[22:10] it but you are a
[22:14] prisoner and now when the word is
[22:18] preached amen and that seed hears the
[22:23] word and it comes to life are you
[22:27] together with me
[22:29] in that Soul there Rises the you know uh
[22:34] uh the the sense of
[22:38] faith that when the word is
[22:41] preached there is something in you that
[22:45] always receives the
[22:49] word and then you start fighting your
[22:54] battles against the flesh from within
[22:57] the soul
[23:00] then that Soul doesn't
[23:03] sin but that Soul fights against
[23:10] sin are you together with
[23:12] me and
[23:14] then the other
[23:17] person who is not an
[23:19] elect he only has one
[23:22] sense also the
[23:24] soul and that's the sense of doubt
[23:30] he doesn't have Revelation in
[23:33] there because Faith gives
[23:37] Revelation but this other man here has
[23:40] got the sense of
[23:43] doubt doubt
[23:45] means that you can see the
[23:48] reality but then you doubt it it be
[23:55] true all these men out there in the
[23:58] world
[24:00] you can preach to them the
[24:02] word and they can almost agree with
[24:06] it but there is a sense of
[24:11] Doubt which PLS that seed
[24:15] out but you a Son of God you have got
[24:20] faith when the word comes to
[24:23] you sometimes you don't even
[24:26] understand faith is
[24:31] Revelation are you together with me
[24:35] Faith is the
[24:37] Revelation there is something in you
[24:40] that will may not explain
[24:43] it I believe
[24:46] it and as you keep going
[24:50] on faith keeps breaking
[24:54] Revelation and at the end of the day you
[24:58] are going to be
[25:00] Sav that you never
[25:04] doubted are you together with
[25:06] me so at the New
[25:10] Birth the gate changes its
[25:15] nature hallelujah hallelujah When Faith
[25:18] is
[25:21] [Music]
[25:23] activated when the of the new
[25:26] birth starts working in
[25:29] you God begins by revealing that you
[25:33] were ordained to eternal
[25:37] life then you start to H for
[25:43] more amen you cannot be you know willing
[25:47] to stay
[25:50] home when the church do are
[25:53] open amen you H for the word
[25:58] H opens the default gate of
[26:03] Faith to make you a
[26:06] Believer and at this point I want tell
[26:12] [Music]
[26:18] you hallelujah hallelujah he moves from
[26:21] your
[26:23] soul to come down to the
[26:26] spirit Hallelujah are you together with
[26:29] me when your seed chin is
[26:33] awaken and you thirst for the
[26:37] word the devil which occupied that
[26:42] spot begins to get
[26:45] defeated he draws from the
[26:48] soul to the human
[26:53] spirit that in the
[26:56] soul there is no more doubt
[26:59] [Music]
[27:01] there's no more way of weighing the word
[27:03] of
[27:05] God when the word comes to
[27:07] you it is always
[27:10] amen and whenever you amen the
[27:14] word then the
[27:16] word amen begins to open greater
[27:21] lights so that you may walk in the
[27:25] light amen and when that word has broken
[27:28] the
[27:31] light of life in the soul of a
[27:35] Believer I tell you the
[27:37] devil that Ed that spot
[27:41] before drops down to the human
[27:46] spirit and he still continues his
[27:49] battles in Galatians chapter
[27:52] 5 verse
[27:54] 17 but this time is not fighting for the
[28:01] soul are you together with me he's
[28:04] fighting from the human
[28:07] spirit amen so G
[28:12] 57 for the flesh against the
[28:18] spirit amen your flesh
[28:22] here is a dead
[28:26] thing without your human
[28:31] Spirit are you together with me when the
[28:34] spirit walks
[28:36] out the body is
[28:38] dead so when Paul
[28:41] says the flesh lth against the
[28:46] spirit is actually talking about what
[28:49] your human Spirit causes your
[28:58] amen for the flesh L against the
[29:03] spirit and the spirit against the
[29:07] FLH and these are contr the one to the
[29:17] other so that you cannot do the things
[29:20] that you
[29:23] would hallelujah hallelujah in your
[29:26] human spirit
[29:28] the devil will continue the
[29:32] fight he was against the spirit of
[29:36] God that dwells in the
[29:39] soul because the spirit of
[29:43] God
[29:45] him and he came to a lower
[29:49] level but even from
[29:52] there he kept sending missiles
[29:56] [Applause]
[30:02] amen trying to aim at the Holy
[30:06] Spirit which is seated in the soul but
[30:10] let me tell you God never loses a
[30:14] battle are you together with me yeah
[30:18] what the devil
[30:20] shoot amen how does he shoot the last of
[30:24] the
[30:25] eye the last of the flesh
[30:29] the pride of life amen these are
[30:33] battles that areed to bring
[30:39] down the Lord Jesus Christ from the
[30:42] Throne of your
[30:44] soul but let me tell you the
[30:48] Temptations of your
[30:51] flesh is not your
[30:54] fault those are
[30:56] battles and continue
[30:59] fighting and
[31:02] overcome he bring a mind to
[31:05] you but that's not your
[31:08] fault that's the devil fighting against
[31:12] you fighting against the holy
[31:16] spirited in the Throne of your
[31:21] soul amen who had these battles in his
[31:26] life praise God
[31:28] The Book of
[31:29] Romans 7 and verse
[31:33] 14 Paul says for we know that the LA is
[31:42] Spirit but I
[31:46] am
[31:51] amen commit to a man that is
[31:56] natural amen
[31:58] and therefore the natural
[32:00] man could not be able to perform a
[32:05] spiritual amen for that which I do I
[32:08] allow
[32:12] not for what I would do that I do
[32:18] not but what I hate that I
[32:22] do if then I do that which I would not
[32:32] I that
[32:35] good now let me say this the intentions
[32:39] of the
[32:41] law were
[32:44] spiritual but when minded of the
[32:49] man he had no strength within
[32:53] him to perform that law
[32:58] right so we come to a
[33:01] point where the Holy
[33:03] Spirit must take
[33:07] over are you together with me to come to
[33:11] a point
[33:13] like where he says no longer
[33:17] I but Christ that lives in
[33:20] me so Christ the first thing he
[33:25] does is to take his SP
[33:29] by Awakening your
[33:32] seed how will you know that your seed
[33:34] gen is
[33:38] awaken because you hate
[33:41] evil and you would love
[33:44] light hallelujah hallelujah and now when
[33:47] you do that you open up for a
[33:51] w the devil will never leave
[33:54] you he will light you
[33:58] doesn't like
[33:59] you where does that voice come from that
[34:03] voice comes from your human
[34:06] Spirit it doesn't come from the soul
[34:09] reject those
[34:11] voices amen praise God so Paul suffered
[34:17] those
[34:18] things amen and verse
[34:22] 24 of that chapter he says oh Wretched
[34:26] Man that I am
[34:30] who shall deliver me from the body of
[34:32] this
[34:35] death amen that was the battle PA was in
[34:40] it and when Paul
[34:43] says I have fought a good
[34:46] fight his fight was not hate the
[34:50] brothers who don't believe like
[34:55] him when he says I fought a good
[34:59] fight he was not fighting
[35:02] brothers that don't support his
[35:06] ministry no sir when he says I fought a
[35:09] good
[35:10] fight he had
[35:13] fought to
[35:15] overcome the human
[35:17] Spirit the flesh which fights against
[35:21] the
[35:25] soul so that Soul realized
[35:29] that without
[35:30] Christ there is no Victory against the
[35:34] flesh so the Cry of the
[35:37] Soul was a cry for a higher
[35:40] [Music]
[35:43] Dimension and Christ came
[35:45] down to meet that
[35:48] need therefore our
[35:51] Victory is Christ at the
[35:55] center and the believer feeding the
[35:58] center with the word of
[36:03] God the word in our
[36:06] marriages amen we then allow the word in
[36:10] our entire
[36:13] families the word in charge of our
[36:18] church the word in charge with
[36:21] whatsoever I decide to
[36:24] do that's how we can overcome
[36:28] amen is at the
[36:30] center where we are connected to the
[36:34] [Music]
[36:41] dimensions are you together with me at
[36:44] the center
[36:46] there which is the
[36:49] S that's the Connecting
[36:53] Point to the dimensions
[37:01] amen so all the
[37:04] preaching is fighting for that
[37:08] s bad
[37:11] preaching is fighting for that
[37:14] s if anything can catch your
[37:19] soul it can connect you to a negative
[37:26] Dimension praise the Lord L therefore
[37:29] what we feed
[37:30] on determines where your soul will open
[37:39] to
[37:43] dimes
[37:45] God
[37:46] rations deeper
[37:49] understanding touch the fth
[37:53] dimension demonic world to your life
[38:01] are you together with me so when you
[38:04] come to
[38:05] church I want you to understand that you
[38:08] are presenting
[38:10] yourself to spirit
[38:14] world if a man preaches his
[38:20] lifestyle that's where you are going to
[38:22] open
[38:25] to you say you're a Christian
[38:29] and you don't KN down to greet people
[38:32] you you say you're Christian preaches
[38:38] culture to prove a person as the holy
[38:42] ghost that church ladies are very
[38:48] humble because they believe that's the
[38:51] holy
[38:53] GH I went to a church
[38:57] and then the man was
[38:59] preaching a woman cannot be above a
[39:03] man and so this is
[39:06] ladies they get around brother they go
[39:15] down and those things control
[39:19] people are you here with me so we really
[39:23] need to
[39:25] know that we are the
[39:31] and once you are in the right
[39:33] word always be
[39:36] patient the word will perform its
[39:42] work okay every
[39:46] doctr connects you to a spirit
[39:50] world so whatever doctr men will
[39:53] [Music]
[39:54] teach there will be spirits come down
[39:59] to back up
[40:01] that so be
[40:03] careful of what you
[40:07] Fe are you together with me you see this
[40:11] is how interesting it
[40:13] is and that's what people don't
[40:19] understand you see I don't want to be
[40:23] very graphic when I'm talking this
[40:31] but
[40:33] whatever
[40:35] Spirit you subject yourself
[40:42] to it will always be able to do
[40:45] something in your
[40:50] life if a Doctrine is
[40:54] preached that to prove you have the Holy
[40:56] Ghost
[40:58] you must climb the tallest
[41:02] tree even the biggest sister
[41:12] here L they will always be a spirit
[41:17] present because the
[41:20] faith connects you to
[41:23] Dimensions the true preaching
[41:27] to the seventh
[41:29] Dimension and the negative
[41:32] preaching also have a channel it will
[41:35] open
[41:37] you so you should always
[41:41] be
[41:45] [Music]
[41:46] willing to only says the
[41:53] Lord so that you can be guided by the
[41:55] word
[41:58] amen so let's position
[42:01] ourselves we therefore must
[42:05] understand the message of the
[42:07] hour not as in quote
[42:12] bye but as is generally laid
[42:16] out because in the
[42:19] Bible there are certain
[42:22] stat which we can
[42:24] say eat and drink
[42:29] because tomorrow we
[42:32] die that's a quote in the
[42:35] Bible and you can bring it to the
[42:38] people eat and drink tomorrow we
[42:43] die and then the word
[42:46] drink you just say it is meaning
[42:52] alcohol but if you connect the entire
[42:55] line of the word
[42:58] you'll come to
[43:00] realize that the
[43:02] drunkards don't inherit the
[43:05] Kingdom but because you have brought
[43:07] just a
[43:09] quot You' C the mind of a
[43:12] man you can come with a
[43:15] quot like John
[43:18] 22 break
[43:20] Temple and in three days I raise it up
[43:25] and that was say in the presence of the
[43:29] temple and the man says hey this man
[43:33] says drink and I mean break this Temple
[43:37] and in three days I raised it up 4
[43:42] years was this temp in
[43:46] building what is it is the problem of
[43:52] a and then the scripture says Jesus was
[43:56] meaning the temp of his
[44:00] body amen so now when we teach the
[44:04] word we must be able to take the
[44:09] people through the entire
[44:13] understanding of the world not to B
[44:17] people by
[44:20] one and then one quote
[44:23] here here is to deliver to you the Walk
[44:28] of
[44:30] God
[44:32] Amen so we must understand the general
[44:35] concept of the
[44:38] word the
[44:40] disciples needed to understand the
[44:42] general concept of the ministry of
[44:46] Christ to bring forth the New
[44:50] Testament in it true
[44:53] context and I want to say it's only
[44:57] PA who that concept
[45:04] perfectly hallelujah hallelujah praise
[45:06] the Lord now I want to say something
[45:10] here which is very
[45:13] powerful and I want you to really follow
[45:17] that I want tell you that
[45:21] Christ was an Old Testament Ministry
[45:30] which opened up into the New
[45:34] Testament
[45:37] at are you together with me amen so
[45:42] understand me very well on
[45:45] this he to come under the order of
[45:50] Levi to establish the order of
[45:57] together with me let me show you some of
[46:01] the
[46:02] areas that would help you to
[46:05] know Jesus his
[46:08] ministry was under the Old
[46:12] Testament to get the Old Testament
[46:17] Saints to bring them in the New
[46:20] Testament are you together with me okay
[46:23] St Luke 2
[46:27] verse
[46:29] 22 praise the Lord he had to be
[46:34] present at the
[46:37] temple as was required for the first
[46:40] born to be
[46:41] presented had to be
[46:44] presented to the temple as the Old
[46:48] Testament required the firstborn
[46:54] son so in St Luke 2 vers
[47:00] 21 to
[47:03] circum amen but Paul did not teach
[47:09] circumcision as was required in Genesis
[47:15] 172 are you together with me but Jesus
[47:19] subjected himself to
[47:22] circumcision another point he had to be
[47:26] washed at the Jordan
[47:29] River in a
[47:31] baptism to
[47:33] show the washing of the
[47:37] sacrifice that was done in the Old
[47:41] Testament before it was
[47:43] offered and not as a
[47:46] testimony of
[47:48] repentance that we do in the New
[47:52] Testament hallelujah hallelujah because
[47:54] for him he had nothing to
[47:57] repent his baptism was not a testimony
[48:01] of
[48:02] repentance his baptism was the Wasing of
[48:05] a
[48:08] sacrifice amen now another thing he went
[48:12] to synagogue on the
[48:16] Sabbath as was the custom in the Old
[48:20] Testament the fifth point when he
[48:23] cleansed the lepers
[48:28] he would tell them go and show yourself
[48:31] to the
[48:33] priest amen he observed the
[48:38] feast amen
[48:42] as the Fe of the
[48:45] Passover in MTH
[48:48] 26
[48:49] verse let us go there he says now the
[48:54] first day of the feast
[48:57] Matthew
[49:01] 267 now the first day of the Feast of
[49:05] the unle bread the disciples came to
[49:20] Jesus saying unto him where thou that we
[49:26] prepare for
[49:27] to eat the
[49:33] pass he observed the
[49:36] [Music]
[49:37] feast and he said go into the
[49:42] city to se a man and say unto him the
[49:47] master
[49:48] says my time is at
[49:51] hand I'll keep the
[49:54] Passover at thy house with my
[49:59] disciples are you together with me so he
[50:02] was you know he was the
[50:06] Fulfillment of all the
[50:10] law all the ceremonies of the Old
[50:14] Testament spoke of
[50:17] him he was represented in all the
[50:22] sacrifices he was represented in all the
[50:24] feasts
[50:27] he was represented in the prophecy by
[50:29] the holy
[50:31] man are you together with me okay I will
[50:35] take you to Matthew
[50:38] 5:17
[50:39] amen think not that I am come to destroy
[50:43] the
[50:47] law 15
[50:52] [Applause]
[50:55] 517 amen all the
[50:59] prophets I am not come to destroy but to
[51:08] fulfill all those spoke of
[51:12] Christ and when he came he walked
[51:16] through all of
[51:19] them fulfilling them they all pointed to
[51:22] his
[51:24] coming are you together with me so the
[51:29] law teaches that the law was a school
[51:36] master that had to seal by the coming of
[51:41] Leviticus
[51:48] 17 says the life is in the blood and I
[51:55] have given you that life
[51:58] on the altar hallelujah hallelujah
[52:01] meaning Christ
[52:04] at hallelujah hallelujah when he died
[52:08] that was the
[52:09] beginning of the New
[52:12] Testament are you together with me yes
[52:15] sir I'm coming so that we can be able to
[52:22] understand not just pick up a quot
[52:28] that no look at the entire
[52:34] concept and then be able to take a full
[52:40] story in one I was taught by an English
[52:51] lady and this is a
[52:53] lady who would give us notes in
[52:59] English I don't
[53:01] know have you ever been under such a
[53:04] school teacher not I'm not talking about
[53:06] literature now English
[53:11] language and you make notes in
[53:15] English and I always had so many
[53:19] questions she called me wise dick
[53:27] she cut my name and says
[53:33] Wick but you see one
[53:37] time she says never be R Among
[53:44] Us he says you'll pass
[53:48] by the
[53:51] stff and you hear the
[53:53] word susp
[53:59] and then after a few
[54:01] minutes you hear the
[54:05] name and then you
[54:07] run and say has been
[54:12] suspended you get this this and you get
[54:16] a
[54:19] doctor we don't want to do
[54:22] that
[54:24] amen so
[54:26] when we go to Romans
[54:29] 10 and verse four he says for
[54:34] Christ is the end of the
[54:39] law for righteousness everyone
[54:46] that amen so he
[54:50] fulf and seal
[54:53] it so that we may come to
[54:58] that the
[55:00] oldest was the
[55:02] image was the
[55:04] picture of the good things to
[55:08] come it was very in
[55:12] Christ in many different
[55:15] ways and when he came he had to walk
[55:18] through that
[55:20] shadow and then
[55:23] emerg as the true prophecy
[55:27] of the
[55:28] atonement are you together with me and
[55:31] so at that Feast of the
[55:34] Passover in
[55:37] 26 verse
[55:40] 28 he held the
[55:42] cup of wine in his
[55:45] arms and he says for this is my
[55:49] blood of the new
[55:51] testament which is Shar for many for the
[55:55] remission of
[55:57] are you together with me that by taking
[56:00] this
[56:02] wife you are
[56:03] [Music]
[56:05] symbolizing of the new
[56:08] testament which
[56:10] begins from when he pour his
[56:15] blood are you together with me
[56:19] so was the
[56:23] man who fully understood the new
[56:31] where Peter was with
[56:36] him would in certain
[56:39] are all these
[56:42] disciples STG in certain
[56:44] are PA had the revelation of the New
[56:53] Testament praise God these things you
[56:56] sit down and listen to them
[56:58] very so at the Crossing of The
[57:03] Testament there was no clear
[57:06] understanding of the New
[57:10] Testament
[57:13] until the Feast of
[57:15] pente I want you to
[57:18] remember I told it to you here when I
[57:21] was speaking about the evening and the
[57:24] morning the of
[57:27] Pentecost was not
[57:30] Perfection it was the Holy
[57:33] Ghost coming upon Liv
[57:39] bread amen are you together with me it
[57:43] was the only
[57:45] Feast which had Liv in
[57:49] it all these other
[57:52] feasts were standing with Christ and
[57:55] Christ Alone
[57:57] the Passover the UN bread the first
[58:02] fruit but when it came to
[58:06] P invol
[58:08] you hallelujah hallelujah and me it
[58:12] involved
[58:16] man so in Leviticus
[58:20] 23 and verse
[58:22] 17 I want you to understand this very
[58:25] well
[58:26] ye shall bring out of your
[58:29] habitations two wave loaves of two t
[58:33] Deals they shall be of fine flour they
[58:37] shall be Beacon with
[58:40] Leen they are the first fruits of the
[58:42] law
[59:25] of are you together with me so
[59:30] two were there on the
[59:34] p and both of
[59:36] them were living fruit I mean living
[59:42] bread that's the beginning of the ear
[59:48] Church the
[59:50] Jews and the
[59:53] Gentiles coming together two
[59:58] loes which
[1:00:00] had they were not perfect
[1:00:03] people so we need to
[1:00:06] understand that
[1:00:08] Pentecost was seed sewing
[1:00:17] time and that's
[1:00:20] why WR the New
[1:00:24] Testament are you together with me talk
[1:00:28] about
[1:00:30] Matthew talk about
[1:00:32] Mark talk about Luke talk about John
[1:00:37] they writing their relationship with
[1:00:41] Christ but when we come to Paul he's
[1:00:45] teaching the New
[1:00:47] Testament The Book of Romans the book of
[1:00:50] Gans the book of Corinthians the book
[1:00:54] ofes the book of
[1:00:57] the book
[1:00:58] ofon all those books there is teaching
[1:01:02] the New Testament Church is the one who
[1:01:05] teaches the New Testament Church the all
[1:01:09] that to walk with the
[1:01:12] church are you together with and then
[1:01:15] when you get
[1:01:17] Peter he has those
[1:01:20] epist but his major
[1:01:24] concern amen was the Jews that were
[1:01:32] dispersed but
[1:01:34] PA understood the two
[1:01:39] laws amen and he says God has got
[1:01:44] a for the Gentiles
[1:01:49] also amen amen am Peter could have the
[1:01:54] keys of God's Kingdom
[1:02:00] but PA had the New
[1:02:07] Testament amen so I want to
[1:02:13] say that
[1:02:15] Jesus did all those
[1:02:18] things go show yourself to the
[1:02:21] priests amen and you know circumcised on
[1:02:25] the
[1:02:29] and he did all those
[1:02:31] things but I want tell you when the
[1:02:34] disciples
[1:02:37] came that was not their
[1:02:40] gospel they did not
[1:02:45] go uh on the Sabbath to the
[1:02:51] synagogues are you together with me yeah
[1:02:54] they were separated from that
[1:02:58] because they understood now the New
[1:03:03] Testament are you together with me they
[1:03:06] were not saying
[1:03:08] anybody go and show
[1:03:10] yourself to the priest and they would
[1:03:14] even bring a
[1:03:16] quot Jesus
[1:03:18] went to the
[1:03:21] synagogue on every
[1:03:26] believe are you a message
[1:03:30] believer are you together with me you
[1:03:33] would have
[1:03:35] said praise the Lord you know they would
[1:03:39] say you blind
[1:03:44] man at the
[1:03:46] beautiful who now standing up walking
[1:03:50] running dancing
[1:03:52] sing Go and show yourself to the priest
[1:03:56] they didn't do that are you together
[1:03:59] with me the order had
[1:04:02] [Music]
[1:04:06] changed you see here he was sowing
[1:04:11] seeds for the New
[1:04:16] Testament but the quotes remain
[1:04:20] there they don't move you just have to
[1:04:24] understand the order of the holy
[1:04:27] spirit let us look at the ministry of
[1:04:31] brother are you together with me just
[1:04:34] like a
[1:04:35] Christ the greater part of brother
[1:04:37] bram's
[1:04:40] Ministry developed under
[1:04:44] Pentecost and yet
[1:04:46] Pentecost is a part of the
[1:04:51] Reformation is not a part of the
[1:04:53] Reformation
[1:04:58] amen it's a part of
[1:05:01] reformation not a part of the you know
[1:05:05] manifestation of the fulfilled
[1:05:09] work Pentecost was not a part of the
[1:05:14] restoration so like a
[1:05:17] Christ his
[1:05:19] ministry was in two
[1:05:22] parts the part of Moses
[1:05:26] which is the calling out of the
[1:05:29] people and the part of
[1:05:32] Joshua which ising them
[1:05:35] in Jesus had the part of calling them
[1:05:39] out and the cross he was blessing the by
[1:05:45] pouring the blood which would bring the
[1:05:48] Holy Ghost
[1:05:51] the so when we are dealing with the
[1:05:54] minister of brother brother
[1:05:58] we need wisdom of
[1:06:02] Revelation because we are dealing with a
[1:06:05] Ministry That
[1:06:08] Grew From
[1:06:11] Pentecost all the way to where we are so
[1:06:16] there is a part of his
[1:06:18] ministry which referred to by this
[1:06:23] statement the former Reigns
[1:06:29] and then he says those were
[1:06:33] teaching then he called it at another
[1:06:37] [Music]
[1:06:38] time time of
[1:06:42] Los and then another time he called it
[1:06:46] to the
[1:06:48] found but this
[1:06:53] stage was up by the opening of The Seven
[1:06:59] Seals hallelujah hallelujah all the
[1:07:04] ministry was leading
[1:07:07] us to the opening of The Seven
[1:07:11] SE like all the ministry of
[1:07:14] Christ was leading us to I mean to
[1:07:18] Cal and the pouring out of the Holy
[1:07:21] Ghost to begin a new testament
[1:07:26] brother all the way from the
[1:07:30] Baptist p through Pentecost was leading
[1:07:35] us to the opening of The Seven
[1:07:39] seeds and the opening of The Seven
[1:07:43] SE brother he says the Bible became a
[1:07:47] new book to
[1:07:51] me are you together with me I want you
[1:07:54] to go back
[1:07:56] home and listen back to this
[1:07:59] message that the Lord will give you
[1:08:03] Grace understand the dispensation of
[1:08:08] time amen so this stage was CED by the
[1:08:12] opening of The Seven
[1:08:17] seal and he says at the opening of The
[1:08:20] Seven
[1:08:22] Seals the ministry
[1:08:25] took a
[1:08:26] corner amen it took a
[1:08:30] turn and after his
[1:08:33] resurrection
[1:08:34] remember Christ did not go back into the
[1:08:41] synagogues after the
[1:08:44] resurrection even if it was a
[1:08:47] Sabbath he didn't go
[1:08:53] back he didn't go back
[1:08:56] amen the order of
[1:08:59] ministry
[1:09:03] turned and even brother
[1:09:06] BR after the opening of The Seven
[1:09:09] SE the order of the
[1:09:17] ministry I'll take you to this
[1:09:20] squad God's power to
[1:09:23] transform but since the opening of those
[1:09:26] Seven
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:28] Seals of them
[1:09:31] Angels just behind the
[1:09:34] mountain this has become a new
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:38] book meaning the
[1:09:40] Bible it is the things that is been
[1:09:45] he is being
[1:09:48] revealed as God promised in Revelation
[1:09:53] 10 he would do it
[1:09:55] and we are the privileged
[1:09:58] people that God has chosen on
[1:10:02] Earth that we might
[1:10:04] see and understand these
[1:10:07] things are you
[1:10:09] privileged has God chosen you to see
[1:10:13] these
[1:10:14] things amen he says which is not some
[1:10:22] mythical fleshly Mind of a person
[1:10:27] trying to make
[1:10:31] it amen so he began to say
[1:10:37] things
[1:10:39] different after the opening of the
[1:10:42] seals and one of those
[1:10:45] things is the B of the Holy
[1:10:51] Ghost are you together with me
[1:10:55] theyve had always
[1:10:58] baptisms and
[1:11:00] baptisms but today is the true B of the
[1:11:04] Holy
[1:11:05] Ghost amen and the word
[1:11:09] true is not being opposed to
[1:11:13] false but it's rather a
[1:11:18] manifestation of what was coming in
[1:11:21] quarters quarters
[1:11:26] I want tell
[1:11:27] you it was
[1:11:30] baptism in the days of
[1:11:32] Luther there was the of
[1:11:37] the but in a
[1:11:41] quarter which was necessary for the
[1:11:44] age there was a b of the Holy
[1:11:47] Ghost in the days of
[1:11:50] wle it was a
[1:11:53] quarter that was necessary
[1:11:56] bring the conviction
[1:11:59] of amen for the of
[1:12:03] sanctification and there was also B of
[1:12:06] the Holy
[1:12:07] Ghost which was a particular
[1:12:10] quarter which caused the people to ask
[1:12:14] for signs and wonders and
[1:12:16] miracles that was also a
[1:12:20] quot ourselves here we have come to the
[1:12:24] true baptism
[1:12:26] which me the
[1:12:29] Gathering all those
[1:12:31] things Christ may be
[1:12:35] manifest Amen in his
[1:12:38] word praise
[1:12:41] God
[1:12:42] so he says in questions and answers of
[1:12:49] 1963 he says you
[1:12:51] see each one of those ages
[1:12:55] only had taken deep into the holy
[1:12:59] spirit amen every age the Holy Spirit
[1:13:05] has always been there but in different
[1:13:10] deeps in the message here
[1:13:17] him he says the
[1:13:21] r the just shall by
[1:13:24] faith and if you just believe it you got
[1:13:28] it no that's
[1:13:33] different because that was their
[1:13:36] emphasis the church shall live by
[1:13:39] faith but he says that this hour is more
[1:13:43] than
[1:13:45] that you see Paul in Acts 19
[1:13:52] said amen to those people have you
[1:13:55] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:13:58] believe so that lets that
[1:14:03] out the
[1:14:06] method
[1:14:08] Methodist the
[1:14:10] Methodist you got it when you
[1:14:15] shout amen that
[1:14:19] was he says then you got
[1:14:22] it when you shout
[1:14:26] that is your
[1:14:28] Methodist when you shout you got
[1:14:31] it they found out many
[1:14:35] shouted but they didn't have
[1:14:40] it are you together with me sister has
[1:14:44] been here
[1:14:46] long we had
[1:14:49] shouting we had
[1:14:52] dancing this floor was always full of
[1:14:54] people
[1:14:57] some
[1:15:01] prophesy I was telling
[1:15:03] people nobody can take us back into that
[1:15:12] disorder let them have the
[1:15:15] experience we had
[1:15:22] ours then he says and Pentecost come
[1:15:26] along the restoration of the
[1:15:29] gifts and they said when you speak with
[1:15:33] the
[1:15:33] tong you got it but they found out many
[1:15:38] spoke with Tong who didn't have
[1:15:44] it those things are all
[1:15:46] right but you can never measure
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:51] on amen that's an attribute of the
[1:15:55] Spirit that's
[1:15:57] right and of those
[1:16:00] emotions which I believe
[1:16:03] in every one of them amen but that's not
[1:16:08] yet
[1:16:09] it holy spirit when you receive it it is
[1:16:14] a
[1:16:15] person of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:19] [Music]
[1:16:22] Christ amen praise the Lord
[1:16:26] praise God Amen and Jesus Says by their
[1:16:31] fruits you shall know
[1:16:33] them so the true baptism is God forming
[1:16:39] his entire
[1:16:45] deeps amen which kept coming through the
[1:16:48] seven Church
[1:16:51] edges into the fullness of Christ
[1:16:54] himself
[1:16:57] to seal the
[1:16:59] believer not with
[1:17:01] emotions but rather the person of Christ
[1:17:06] himself
[1:17:12] theen
[1:17:14] amen praise God listen to stat of a
[1:17:18] perfect
[1:17:19] man he brought his church up the same
[1:17:23] way is bringing his people
[1:17:27] up then Peter here
[1:17:29] says first seven
[1:17:32] things Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:17:38] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:17:42] and then the love of God the Holy
[1:17:46] Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy
[1:17:51] Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism
[1:17:55] of the Holy Ghost and you got all these
[1:18:00] virtues sealed in
[1:18:03] you amen now why does he say the true
[1:18:11] baptism because the Holy Ghost kept
[1:18:15] growing with the
[1:18:17] church amen then when the
[1:18:21] lutherans they said when you afraid
[1:18:27] you've got it that was true the
[1:18:32] Methodist amen they got the
[1:18:36] excitement
[1:18:38] sanctification and they
[1:18:40] shouted that was the Holy Ghost but that
[1:18:43] was not the end of it it was just the
[1:18:46] Holy Spirit growing
[1:18:49] through and in Pentecost they spok in
[1:18:53] Tong
[1:18:54] was the Holy Ghost they had gifts that
[1:18:58] was true but all that was not the
[1:19:04] fullness of the Holy Ghost so when the
[1:19:08] fullness is
[1:19:09] come Accord to the true baptism of the
[1:19:12] Holy
[1:19:15] Ghost amen you see what I mean brother
[1:19:19] Bram says Paul it is Paul he says that
[1:19:24] when when
[1:19:26] he that is perfect is
[1:19:29] come amen praise the Lord let us go to
[1:19:35] uh First Corinthians
[1:19:38] 13 do you love him this
[1:19:42] morning I think let me do my
[1:19:46] best cover up
[1:19:49] this then we shall go and comfort our
[1:19:52] sister
[1:19:55] amen First
[1:19:59] Corinthians when he that is perfect is
[1:20:02] come you give me that
[1:20:07] scripture when he that is perfect is
[1:20:19] come ver 10 I have a computer here
[1:20:27] now he has been
[1:20:31] speaking about different
[1:20:34] manifestations amen some who speak with
[1:20:39] Tes of
[1:20:41] angels some who
[1:20:43] prophesy some who have
[1:20:50] got amen and all those things but when
[1:20:54] it comes to verse
[1:20:55] 10 amen he says but when that which is
[1:20:59] perfect is
[1:21:02] come then that which is in
[1:21:05] part shall be
[1:21:08] done he's saying all these things that
[1:21:12] you try to
[1:21:13] prophesy jump up and down he says all
[1:21:17] those things will pass away the
[1:21:21] perfect is
[1:21:23] come and sometimes they say now you
[1:21:27] mean no it's not me who mean it's the
[1:21:32] teaching of the message of the
[1:21:35] hour that some of those things will pass
[1:21:39] away you are not going to hold them as
[1:21:42] the
[1:21:43] evidence because they
[1:21:46] shouted and didn't have it I don't say
[1:21:49] you don't
[1:21:50] shout shout
[1:21:52] amen the word touches
[1:21:55] amen but don't say now I've
[1:22:00] got amen when God has given the true of
[1:22:04] the Holy
[1:22:06] Spirit then the life of Jesus
[1:22:09] Christ is within
[1:22:11] you he sees as to speak of the Holy
[1:22:15] Ghost as the
[1:22:17] anointing but the indwelling
[1:22:22] person the person him
[1:22:25] himself the Seal of
[1:22:28] life amen I want you to hear this in the
[1:22:32] sign of the
[1:22:34] end is this says is this the
[1:22:38] time
[1:22:41] listen somebody stay
[1:22:45] around I love that say
[1:22:49] amen he says that some of the Mysteries
[1:22:53] that this angel is supposed to
[1:23:02] up at the opening of The Seven
[1:23:05] Seals the mystery all the mysteries of
[1:23:10] God and the
[1:23:13] other may I say this with
[1:23:17] reverence I'm not referring to
[1:23:21] myself but referring to the of
[1:23:26] God the Ser
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:29] seed been
[1:23:31] hidden all through
[1:23:34] the the straightened
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:40] out not
[1:23:46] this but real
[1:23:49] true amen not such a thing as an eternal
[1:23:53] burning
[1:23:59] all these
[1:24:01] Mysteries and then he comes to paragraph
[1:24:07] 26 and he says the
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:11] mystery of the
[1:24:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost without a
[1:24:19] sensation now people they take all the
[1:24:23] other mystery
[1:24:26] which is revealed in the Seven
[1:24:29] Seals but when they come to this one
[1:24:32] they
[1:24:35] rejected they still want some
[1:24:39] emotion they still want to
[1:24:41] shout a young doctor told
[1:24:44] me I agree with what you've
[1:24:47] told but why don't you teach the
[1:24:50] evidence I don't teach the evidence
[1:24:53] because whatever you teach the
[1:24:55] people there will be a spirit to
[1:25:00] impersonate when they went to the Upp
[1:25:03] room they didn't go to receive the
[1:25:06] evidence they went to receive the
[1:25:09] person let the person when he
[1:25:12] comes do what he wants to
[1:25:15] do when I tell you you
[1:25:19] jump to do that
[1:25:25] you see what I mean because the you know
[1:25:27] teaching
[1:25:29] faith is touching
[1:25:34] Dimensions so as a teacher you don't
[1:25:37] teach
[1:25:38] evidence you teach the B of the holy
[1:25:43] spirit in the hour that we are
[1:25:46] living so before opening the
[1:25:50] seals he Tau in the light of the past
[1:25:53] age
[1:25:56] are you together with me there are
[1:25:58] certain things he
[1:26:00] told that the human
[1:26:02] spirit is the one that is at the
[1:26:05] center but then he says no after the
[1:26:08] light is come he says it's the
[1:26:12] Soul at one time he told that Christ was
[1:26:16] I mean Christ was the White House
[1:26:20] Rider but when the word comes he says no
[1:26:24] it's the
[1:26:26] Antichrist at one time he don't love
[1:26:29] being the evidence of the B of the Holy
[1:26:33] Ghost and so many other things he kept
[1:26:37] changing it's true that he talked about
[1:26:41] those
[1:26:43] emotions but under
[1:26:46] what period of his
[1:26:53] ministry are you understanding
[1:26:55] me because if we do
[1:27:00] that then it's like a Paul healing the
[1:27:04] Le and telling them go and show yourself
[1:27:08] to the
[1:27:10] priest you understand me this
[1:27:12] morning amen praise the Lord so we don't
[1:27:17] dispute the need of the B of the ho
[1:27:22] ghost it is very
[1:27:26] important but we cannot
[1:27:29] emphasize and we tell people when he
[1:27:31] comes you do this
[1:27:33] when let him come let him do what he
[1:27:36] wants to
[1:27:40] do amen so the past age the emphasis was
[1:27:45] on
[1:27:47] turn and
[1:27:49] emotions which has not
[1:27:51] ceased but should be I mean should not
[1:27:56] Beed as the
[1:27:59] evidence according to brother
[1:28:02] BR amen
[1:28:05] secondly you cannot disassociate the Bas
[1:28:09] of the Holy
[1:28:12] Ghost without
[1:28:14] Sensation from being one of the
[1:28:18] Mysteries amen let me say it properly
[1:28:22] you cannot disass
[1:28:29] of the ho
[1:28:30] ghost and you separate
[1:28:33] it from the
[1:28:36] truth that it comes without a
[1:28:44] sensation he says one of the Mysteries
[1:28:46] that was
[1:28:49] revealed so I'll show you something here
[1:28:55] Pastor dealt a lot with it but let me
[1:28:59] bring it here
[1:29:00] too he says I know it's a great
[1:29:04] temptation to refer back to the day of
[1:29:08] Pentecost and also to the day when the
[1:29:10] Holy Ghost fell on the house of
[1:29:14] Cornelius and then set those two
[1:29:16] identical
[1:29:20] experiences as the evidence of the BS of
[1:29:23] the Holy Ghost
[1:29:25] he says it
[1:29:27] is a great
[1:29:30] temptation to go back to the
[1:29:34] Pentecost and what happened in the house
[1:29:38] of and then what happened when the Holy
[1:29:41] Ghost
[1:29:43] came it's a great
[1:29:45] Temptation for
[1:29:47] people and they end up calling it the
[1:29:51] evidence
[1:29:54] that's not
[1:29:56] me that's your
[1:29:58] message
[1:30:00] amen but on each
[1:30:05] occasion the tongues were understood by
[1:30:07] the
[1:30:10] listeners this is a far cry from the B
[1:30:13] bubble of confusion of the Pentecostal
[1:30:16] meetings
[1:30:34] now you can begin to see why
[1:30:37] T is not the evidence of being baptized
[1:30:40] with the Holy
[1:30:42] Ghost it doesn't say any
[1:30:46] age he that has the tongue let him say
[1:30:49] what the spe is saying
[1:30:55] that puts
[1:30:57] T interpretation
[1:30:59] thereof and prophecy
[1:31:02] aside as the
[1:31:05] evidence the evidence is hearing what
[1:31:08] the spirit
[1:31:11] says hallelujah hallelujah the spirit is
[1:31:15] talking yes the spirit is teaching this
[1:31:18] is exactly what Jesus says he will do
[1:31:22] when he comes
[1:31:24] hallelujah hallelujah when he comes
[1:31:27] he'll teach
[1:31:29] you that's the
[1:31:31] evidence praise God you hear the word
[1:31:35] you receive the word you perform the
[1:31:37] word that's the
[1:31:41] evidence amen do you shout
[1:31:45] also yes but that's not the evidence do
[1:31:49] you dance yes but that's not the can you
[1:31:54] speak in Tong yes but that's
[1:32:01] not praise the Lord amen yes sir you
[1:32:07] heard the pastor
[1:32:09] teach
[1:32:11] [Music]
[1:32:14] amen he
[1:32:16] that more will be
[1:32:18] given have what he that has a seed gen
[1:32:24] he that has an
[1:32:27] in hallelujah hallelujah he has the
[1:32:29] ability to receive from the
[1:32:32] ho the Holy Ghost will keep giving
[1:32:37] him
[1:32:39] amen John
[1:32:42] 14:26 he will teach you all
[1:32:45] things and bring all things to your
[1:32:49] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[1:32:52] you
[1:32:54] and that it is just what
[1:32:57] happened that is how the gospel were
[1:33:01] written these men had recalled to their
[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:07] minds by the Holy
[1:33:10] Ghost the very words that Jesus
[1:33:14] SP that's why the gospels are
[1:33:19] accurate amen praise God they had
[1:33:24] and they were
[1:33:25] reminded hallelujah hallelujah and when
[1:33:28] you come here by the Holy Ghost here the
[1:33:32] Holy Ghost to us and at the right time
[1:33:36] the Holy Ghost will bring back these
[1:33:39] things to
[1:33:40] you
[1:33:42] amen praise God yes sir there's a
[1:33:46] brother from the
[1:33:48] state he sent me a message this morning
[1:33:54] from thean
[1:33:56] church that a person who says he knows
[1:34:00] god without the word is
[1:34:07] St because the word is the
[1:34:11] seed so what are you going to S praise
[1:34:15] God so they are perfect but the spirit
[1:34:19] did not only bring all things to their
[1:34:21] minds
[1:34:24] but he taught them
[1:34:27] further on the truth they already
[1:34:31] had that's how Paul received his
[1:34:37] Revelations amen and then we come down
[1:34:40] here to the Lan
[1:34:43] church he says then there's all this
[1:34:47] talk about
[1:34:57] it is supposed to be the evidence of the
[1:34:59] BM of the Holy
[1:35:08] Ghost people are
[1:35:11] thinking that we're in the midst of a
[1:35:13] great
[1:35:15] Revival the Revival is
[1:35:19] over America had chance in 1957
[1:35:27] so now the tong are God's
[1:35:31] sign of impending
[1:35:36] disaster even as they were
[1:35:40] then they appeared upon the
[1:35:44] wall at bel's
[1:35:51] Feast talking Tong
[1:35:55] good
[1:35:58] it's but not the
[1:36:00] evidence and whenever TKS
[1:36:03] came it was not prophesying
[1:36:08] Revival it always spoke about
[1:36:14] disaster at the wall in Babylon
[1:36:23] [Laughter]
[1:36:25] you have been put in a
[1:36:28] balance and you you have been
[1:36:35] made
[1:36:37] amen and then he was thrown out of the
[1:36:41] Kingdom on the day of
[1:36:43] Pentecost the Jews spoke in
[1:36:46] Tong they lost the
[1:36:49] gospel the Gentiles took it the Gentiles
[1:36:53] are speaking
[1:36:55] they lose it the Jews will take it it's
[1:36:59] a prophetic
[1:37:01] sign amen so let's talk now about the
[1:37:07] need of the B of the Holy
[1:37:11] Spirit when we
[1:37:13] say of the B of the Holy Ghost without
[1:37:18] Sensation that people
[1:37:20] think we don't believe in the B of the
[1:37:25] Holy because they think the Holy Spirit
[1:37:30] can only come
[1:37:36] by why do they have to tell
[1:37:39] people what they should do when he
[1:37:43] comes and whatever they are
[1:37:45] taught is what they
[1:37:47] do if he's jumping they
[1:37:51] jump he has a guy had a man
[1:37:54] he rode down
[1:37:56] here he threw all his legs all over the
[1:38:00] place and all the mucus was coming out
[1:38:04] he was not caring to clean
[1:38:09] up
[1:38:11] because because the new birth is a
[1:38:18] mess so he was proving he was having a
[1:38:21] mess
[1:38:27] after that
[1:38:28] service he came to me and he says Pastor
[1:38:33] God says it's very pleased with
[1:38:35] you you have done a great work in this
[1:38:39] town but he wants to retire
[1:38:42] you and I'm going to become the
[1:38:49] pastor and God has
[1:38:52] said that you don't only take a
[1:38:55] TI we shall be giving you
[1:39:03] 40% and then will go to the
[1:39:16] P so we've been through all this we want
[1:39:20] you to stabilize
[1:39:23] in the
[1:39:25] word you see it's too bad to go so
[1:39:30] far then you discover you are
[1:39:37] disappointed I will not say that
[1:39:40] one now just look at one
[1:39:45] thing your
[1:39:47] election and not what the Holy Ghost
[1:39:51] does in the process of filling me with
[1:39:54] the holy
[1:39:55] spirit because the promise is
[1:39:58] yours the holy spirit is the
[1:40:03] elect hallelujah hallelujah so first you
[1:40:06] have to look at
[1:40:08] Redemption the work of the Holy
[1:40:11] Ghost one thing the moment you
[1:40:14] feel that something has worked in your
[1:40:17] life and caus you to
[1:40:20] change against your past life
[1:40:23] that is
[1:40:25] justification and that's already the
[1:40:27] work of the Holy
[1:40:28] Ghost amen when the holy God keeps you
[1:40:33] in studying the
[1:40:34] wording
[1:40:36] itting
[1:40:38] your that's a work of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:41] that is
[1:40:42] sanctification amen and then you must so
[1:40:47] remember like you could not justify
[1:40:51] yourself yourself
[1:40:53] you cannot baptize yourself with the
[1:40:56] Holy
[1:40:57] Ghost amen the Holy Ghost the gift of
[1:41:02] God to you and you must take it by
[1:41:07] faith
[1:41:09] amen the true baptism of the Holy
[1:41:13] Ghost is a
[1:41:15] process that God starts in our lives by
[1:41:18] justification
[1:41:23] say just like making a
[1:41:26] vehicle the manufacturer makes the
[1:41:28] mechanics
[1:41:31] first before he could move to its
[1:41:35] Dynamics but yet the creator of the
[1:41:39] mechanics is the same one that gives the
[1:41:45] Dynamics hallelujah hallelujah the Lord
[1:41:48] who pulled you from that
[1:41:51] cigarette the brought you from the
[1:41:54] prostitution
[1:41:56] house is the same
[1:41:59] God willing to baptize you with
[1:42:03] the amen so if he did the first
[1:42:08] step keep thanking
[1:42:10] him amen
[1:42:13] justification and
[1:42:15] sanctification and God putting the
[1:42:17] mechanics of your Christian Life right
[1:42:23] that when the Holy Ghost
[1:42:25] comes he meets when you are a stable
[1:42:29] car hallelujah hallelujah amen you see
[1:42:33] those cars there amen the mechanics must
[1:42:36] be
[1:42:37] right the car must have the
[1:42:41] wheels amen but if you standing on
[1:42:45] something
[1:42:46] else you go and put the
[1:42:50] Dynamics it will start out it will not
[1:42:54] go anywhere because the mechanics are
[1:42:56] not
[1:42:58] right praise God Amen that's why brother
[1:43:02] Bram obedience to the
[1:43:05] word the it will become
[1:43:11] automatic
[1:43:13] amen praise God God's provided place of
[1:43:18] worship brother Bram says now we find
[1:43:22] out that come into God's provided
[1:43:26] way with his word and walked 500
[1:43:31] years and pleased him and we find out
[1:43:36] that the mechanics were set so perfect
[1:43:40] in
[1:43:42] him that when the Dynamics got to
[1:43:45] working in the
[1:43:47] engine it just took him off the
[1:43:50] Earth hallelujah hallelujah what was
[1:43:54] necessary it was putting the mechanics
[1:43:58] right to put the word in your
[1:44:01] life that's the thing that you should be
[1:44:04] concerned
[1:44:06] with so in the Min of the
[1:44:09] word God is fixing your
[1:44:12] mechanics he's pieing together your
[1:44:16] attitude and creating the desire in your
[1:44:19] life to receive the bom of the Holy
[1:44:22] Ghost
[1:44:24] so it is not three
[1:44:26] works but one
[1:44:28] work has it
[1:44:30] started yes he has started on you
[1:44:34] because you are here this
[1:44:36] morning you are here because you are
[1:44:38] just
[1:44:39] F here to be
[1:44:42] Sanctified one work so he started on the
[1:44:46] process every morning you wake up to
[1:44:49] thank God because he promised to fill
[1:44:52] you the
[1:44:54] the amen praise God he says now then
[1:45:00] there was
[1:45:01] justification
[1:45:03] sanctification the B of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:06] not three different
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:10] dispensations three works of
[1:45:13] Grace but one work in three different
[1:45:18] manifestations same holy spirit with lu
[1:45:23] hallelujah hallelujah under
[1:45:25] justification was under wle with
[1:45:30] sanctification in the church now in the
[1:45:33] B of the Holy Ghost the same Holy Spirit
[1:45:38] not to Holy Spirit the same Holy
[1:45:42] Spirit are you together with me he was
[1:45:46] there
[1:45:48] with but in our understanding we said
[1:45:52] this is the age of the Holy
[1:45:54] Spirit it has always been the edge of
[1:45:57] the Holy
[1:45:58] SP amen so do you see where I'm coming
[1:46:02] from it's a growing
[1:46:05] life you just have to set your
[1:46:07] understanding
[1:46:11] right that's all you
[1:46:13] need your
[1:46:15] problem as far as the B of the Holy
[1:46:17] Ghost is
[1:46:19] conern is just your attitude
[1:46:25] when you think
[1:46:27] wrong you don't have it when you think
[1:46:31] right you'll
[1:46:33] have amen let's go to
[1:46:36] acts
[1:46:38] 18 verse
[1:46:40] 24 and verse
[1:46:42] 25 I want you to see how
[1:46:45] easy it is for you to receive the bom of
[1:46:49] the
[1:46:51] Holy very easy you were here because you
[1:46:55] are
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:56] candidate for the BM of the holy
[1:47:01] spirit
[1:47:04] amen so acts
[1:47:09] 18:24 and a certain Jew named
[1:47:14] Apollos born
[1:47:18] Alexandri an El man
[1:47:23] might in the
[1:47:25] scriptures came
[1:47:27] to this man was instructed in the way of
[1:47:31] the
[1:47:33] Lord and being fent in
[1:47:36] spirit he SP and taught diligently the
[1:47:39] things of the
[1:47:42] Lord knowing
[1:47:45] only the B of
[1:47:48] John that's where the problem was
[1:47:53] he had everything he needed for the B of
[1:47:55] the Holy
[1:47:58] Ghost but because he understood the BM
[1:48:01] of John
[1:48:03] ra he could not receive the
[1:48:07] BM they already had the
[1:48:10] qualities that Reed the Holy Ghost they
[1:48:14] were Believers of the word but their
[1:48:17] problem was in verse
[1:48:19] 25 they were not aware
[1:48:23] of the
[1:48:25] promise amen they were not aware that's
[1:48:29] what you need you need to understand
[1:48:33] that the promise is
[1:48:35] yours and you need to have faith that
[1:48:38] the promise is
[1:48:39] yours all this works by the hearing of
[1:48:45] Faith because the hearing of faith is
[1:48:48] what brings down the B of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:51] your life
[1:48:57] Galatians
[1:49:00] 3 the
[1:49:02] Galatians they had received the bom of
[1:49:04] the Holy
[1:49:10] Spirit but they wanted to mix
[1:49:14] it with the
[1:49:17] law and it hurt the holy
[1:49:20] spirit so the holy ho Spirit rebukes
[1:49:25] them in Galatians chapter
[1:49:28] 3 verse
[1:49:30] one he says oh foolish
[1:49:35] Galatians who has Bewitched
[1:49:42] you that you should obey the truth
[1:49:46] before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been
[1:49:49] evidently set forth crucified among you
[1:49:59] amen this only would I learn of you
[1:50:02] received ye the Spirit by The Works of
[1:50:04] the law or by the hearing of
[1:50:20] Faith praise the Lord he's asking them
[1:50:25] how did you receive the Holy
[1:50:29] Ghost he says you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:50:32] by the hearing of
[1:50:35] Faith so in
[1:50:38] Roman
[1:50:39] paa this hearing of
[1:50:42] Faith The Obedience of
[1:50:46] faith and brother Bram in the token
[1:50:50] messages he calls it fully obedient
[1:50:56] so do you have the full
[1:50:59] obedience then you are
[1:51:01] candidate for the bom of the Holy
[1:51:04] Ghost so that makes the
[1:51:07] word the Al and the
[1:51:10] Omega the hearing of
[1:51:13] faiths in the B of the Holy
[1:51:16] Ghost and the evidence is that you stay
[1:51:20] in the word
[1:51:24] and you manifest
[1:51:27] it okay John
[1:51:31] 16 I'm finishing in the next 15 minutes
[1:51:35] or he
[1:51:37] says how about when
[1:51:40] he the spirit of Truth is
[1:51:44] come he will guide you in all truth
[1:51:48] that's how we
[1:51:51] know me
[1:51:53] 163 13 rather 1 not three but
[1:52:10] 13 amen he will guide you in all
[1:52:19] truth not only speak
[1:52:23] perform SS have
[1:52:25] emotions but he guides you in all
[1:52:29] truth there's no greater evidence laid
[1:52:33] down in
[1:52:36] scripture the
[1:52:38] evidence is
[1:52:40] believing and being
[1:52:42] guided in what you believe leing the
[1:52:46] life of the
[1:52:47] world so the Holy Ghost teaches the
[1:52:51] message of the
[1:52:54] to the believer and causes that believer
[1:52:58] to Bear the fruit of that
[1:53:01] one and the evidence will never
[1:53:06] change somebody here say
[1:53:09] Amen the evidence never
[1:53:11] changes in thean
[1:53:14] ch brother Bram says in every age the
[1:53:20] evidence was the same
[1:53:22] hallelujah hallelujah the evidence was
[1:53:25] the
[1:53:25] same those who had the
[1:53:28] spirit the
[1:53:30] teacher had the word and the spirit in
[1:53:34] them took the word and T it to them and
[1:53:39] they were of the
[1:53:41] group that had the
[1:53:43] messenger and this message and took it
[1:53:48] and lived
[1:53:51] it and says that's the
[1:53:54] evidence and he says it you never change
[1:53:58] the evidence you come to the knowledge
[1:54:00] of the world you take it and you leave
[1:54:04] the instruction of the
[1:54:06] word are you together with me yeah so I
[1:54:10] don't want you to start getting so
[1:54:13] troubled are you a believer in the
[1:54:16] word amen does the word work life in
[1:54:20] you that's what the evidence is supposed
[1:54:23] the evidence is not your good work but
[1:54:26] the evidence is hearing the word
[1:54:29] manifesting the
[1:54:31] fruit of that word so the fruit is
[1:54:36] greater than your
[1:54:37] works the fruit is the work of the Holy
[1:54:41] Ghost in
[1:54:42] your amen not your
[1:54:47] labor oh God help
[1:54:49] me so so that I can some I think who
[1:54:53] even beat their own
[1:54:55] mouth don't beat the mouth open the
[1:54:59] Avenue for the Holy
[1:55:00] Ghost when he
[1:55:02] comes you will bear the fruit of
[1:55:06] the am praise God yes sir so let me
[1:55:13] finish up here with what we need
[1:55:17] so
[1:55:19] stimulation of Revelation
[1:55:22] the
[1:55:23] emotions amen jump it's very good I like
[1:55:30] it if the word has come your
[1:55:33] way say Amen you say a very healthy
[1:55:39] one
[1:55:41] amen you see you don't have to leave
[1:55:44] your
[1:55:46] seat and you run through
[1:55:49] the to come and
[1:55:56] just stay where you are and send the you
[1:56:03] reach praise the
[1:56:05] Lord if you're happy you clap your
[1:56:09] heart you lift up your heart that's okay
[1:56:14] but the problem is the people to mix
[1:56:18] that amen as the B of the Holy Spirit
[1:56:23] are you together with me the B of the
[1:56:25] Holy Ghost is different it's the person
[1:56:29] of the Lord coming in living in your
[1:56:33] life by the word and manifest his
[1:56:36] presence by your
[1:56:39] fruit amen and when the word is in you
[1:56:43] the man teaches like I am doing and it
[1:56:47] comes right to back to your your your
[1:56:51] your soul here
[1:56:56] that's what I was seeing every day
[1:57:00] amen and you bring a good one
[1:57:04] that hallelujah it's okay praise
[1:57:09] God you know we call it
[1:57:14] stimulation that comes after
[1:57:20] Revelation sometimes you get
[1:57:24] something and you don't even
[1:57:27] say you just get
[1:57:32] astounded and you you you you shake your
[1:57:37] head wonder how is
[1:57:40] this God you see you remember when I
[1:57:44] spoke about the B
[1:57:52] and the pastor
[1:57:59] preaches
[1:58:01] emotion is
[1:58:04] okay anything without
[1:58:07] emotion is
[1:58:09] dead but the
[1:58:12] emotion that doesn't have biic order
[1:58:24] people had G to coming with trumpets in
[1:58:31] church some others with
[1:58:35] whle we come to church to hear the
[1:58:40] word but if something is
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:45] done totally to take away the hearing of
[1:58:48] the
[1:58:49] word there is something wrong
[1:58:52] [Applause]
[1:58:54] blowing
[1:58:55] trumpets I can blow it at
[1:58:57] home the whistles I can blow
[1:59:01] at are you together with but then you
[1:59:04] come to church and then one sister comes
[1:59:07] to the
[1:59:09] front and then then another one then
[1:59:12] another one is
[1:59:15] f before the word is out of the
[1:59:18] preachers m
[1:59:22] now what are you here
[1:59:24] for wait
[1:59:30] [Applause]
[1:59:33] first are you together with me and let
[1:59:36] me tell you the bodies of our
[1:59:40] sisters are
[1:59:44] so that you be
[1:59:46] careful to what
[1:59:48] levels you discr that body
[2:00:01] let him
[2:00:06] understand stimulation of
[2:00:10] Revelation goes with
[2:00:14] Sensations when the
[2:00:16] word challenges your human
[2:00:20] Spirit the body May
[2:00:23] re when you're
[2:00:28] reasoning when you're
[2:00:30] reasoning and affections are
[2:00:33] challenged you can react with
[2:00:38] emotions amen if you used to be in the
[2:00:41] wrong way and something is
[2:00:44] say to challenge that wrong
[2:00:49] way amen human
[2:00:53] spirit will
[2:00:55] react and then you'll say Lord
[2:01:01] I'm are you together with me yes sir and
[2:01:05] that's why brother Bram says of the
[2:01:07] people come to the altar they
[2:01:10] overwhelmed by the
[2:01:13] emotion of
[2:01:16] sanctification and they cry out and they
[2:01:19] call it the Holy Ghost
[2:01:26] so when you're
[2:01:29] reason and affections are
[2:01:33] challenged you can
[2:01:35] say Amen if the word goes to the
[2:01:40] soul and promotes or lifts higher your
[2:01:47] understanding of something
[2:01:52] not
[2:01:53] St Amen brother Bram says in the St of a
[2:01:58] perfect man now a lot of people go up to
[2:02:01] the
[2:02:03] Altar and pray and say forgive me the
[2:02:08] great experience of
[2:02:12] sanctification come upon them then you
[2:02:15] have a great time get up to the altar
[2:02:18] shouting you go back and say bless God I
[2:02:23] got it no you just started to a
[2:02:28] place yeah you can grow you hav done
[2:02:31] nothing yet the only thing you done is
[2:02:35] just let the
[2:02:38] foundation amen that is
[2:02:41] sanctification you
[2:02:43] overwhelmed by the life there something
[2:02:47] wrong in your life you cry out the
[2:02:50] altar all right don't call that the
[2:02:59] baptism some of those
[2:03:01] things that's the human spirit being
[2:03:07] exposed it may cause some
[2:03:11] emotions amen yes sir and when
[2:03:14] Revelation hits the
[2:03:17] soul it moves to reset the human spirit
[2:03:28] this causes emotional
[2:03:33] reaction you can cry you can
[2:03:42] Rejoice the wife it I never heard it
[2:03:47] before that's okay have your Liberty
[2:03:51] if you want to cry cry if you want to
[2:03:58] laugh are you together with me yeah but
[2:04:01] don't say because you did that that was
[2:04:05] the Holy Ghost don't connect that to the
[2:04:09] baptism of the Holy
[2:04:13] Spirit and when you do it the spirit of
[2:04:17] a prophet is subject to Prophets
[2:04:26] [Music]
[2:04:28] don't that spirit is overwhelming
[2:04:33] me and they came and even F in the
[2:04:41] platform a little bit of teaching this
[2:04:47] morning listen to what brother Bram says
[2:04:51] that's what I think about a good
[2:04:54] oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[2:04:56] [Music]
[2:05:01] meeting when I can hear a good old
[2:05:09] amen oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah
[2:05:13] somebody JP up and scream and cry a
[2:05:16] little
[2:05:18] bit I know that's shining somewhere
[2:05:26] just kind of gives you just a real good
[2:05:30] feeling of
[2:05:32] that but do it in
[2:05:37] moderation nobody should say iner you
[2:05:41] don't
[2:05:42] say in ginger you don't
[2:05:46] Rejoice you don't
[2:05:48] cry we do
[2:05:55] uhuh and it's one praise the Lord so we
[2:06:00] must
[2:06:01] separate stimulation of
[2:06:06] Revelation amen and also the Bas of the
[2:06:10] Holy
[2:06:11] Ghost amen though things may be
[2:06:15] real but they are neither the B itself
[2:06:22] evidence but it's the
[2:06:25] return amen of the joy of
[2:06:29] Salvation making you
[2:06:31] rejoice and on the third
[2:06:34] seal of your life you need to protect
[2:06:37] the
[2:06:39] whe amen and
[2:06:42] the amen when the word Falls in
[2:06:46] there amen the word amen the word
[2:06:51] and when the
[2:06:53] wi gets right

[2:07:20] it

[2:07:25] one
[2:07:26] thing that
[2:07:28] Faith deals with
[2:07:34] Dimensions you bring it
[2:07:36] wrong he takes the people the wrong
[2:07:40] way you bring it right the Holy Spirit
[2:07:45] himself brings the
[2:07:48] reaction postively
[2:07:51] that has been
