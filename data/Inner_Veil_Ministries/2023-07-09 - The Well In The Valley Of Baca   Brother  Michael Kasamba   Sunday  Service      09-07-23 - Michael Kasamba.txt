and here we are this morning amen just want to look us to look at something small here because I know and believe you have a great ministry here yes that teaches and establishes the same is the same Ministry that has made me who I am today amen so I I just have something small as a brick that I can add on to the building is I cannot put on those big shoes so I thank pastor Pastor Steven Universe who have given me the grace and opportunity to stand before you here this morning and every one of you here there are many things going on so many diversions people leaving the path you remember that vision of brother Branham the bride preview why did he cry out he cried stay in line yeah amen and uh by God's grace that's what I I strive to do to stay in line because many are falling off many are departing from this way of Faith many are taking of the tree of knowledge seeking for knowledge encyclopedias and books to try to dispute the message did I dispute the revealed word dispute the truth that is before our eyes but the Cry of the spirit is and I want to just share some few things here just to help us in our everyday Christian Living I mean I'm not going to bring a big Doctrine or teachings because I know you're well established in that one will come but I'm just going to bring something small that can help us in our everyday lives let's just say a word of prayer dear gracious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you know you are here this morning I feel your presence I pray Lord Jesus but you take me out of the way and for this one or two hours you open my mouth open the mouth of mine and take us through your words of everyone here that we may be able to hear from you hear from the spirit that we may be blessed I know you've done it father you performed your words thank you Lord in Your Righteous Name Lord Jesus Christ foreign it says here blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them ah is that what it says blessed is the man whose strength is in thee are the ways of them all passing through the valley of baka make it a whale the rain also filled the pools foreign [Music] Job 14 verse 1. Job 14 1. take another finger to proverbs 5. Job 14 1 says man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble foreign he says drink Waters out of thine own system and running Waters out of thine own well let thy fountains be this past abroad and rivers of waters in the streets let them be only thine own are not strangers with thee foreign blessed is that man whose strength is in Hope then he says passing through the valley of baka makes it a well that you follow Cuba and Salon then he says they go from strength to strength after doing what going through the valley of baka you have made a well and in Proverbs Solomon says drink Waters out of thine own system and running Waters out of thine own well in this life of troubles because the job has told us man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of words full of troubles who going through those short days you go from strength to strength Amina we don't stay put in one place Hallelujah and in Proverbs he's telling us here bring waters out of thine Waters and running Waters out of thy own well so how will you drink the waters if you've not dug the world foreign because the scripture cannot be broken I need the power connectivity first going down yes sir at the beginning part of it all right David says here blessed is the man whose strength is so where does the starting point is what is the starting point the starting point is that your strength is in God that's the beginning Point not in your own strength not in anything else but in the Lord in the message all the days of our life see that that's just the nature of man 219 he wants his own way and God did not make man to desire his own way God made man to depend on him so what is the beginning point of it is that we depend on God he says to forsake his way is to crucify his way and we get lost so man is to depend on God spiritually physically in all aspects of Our Lives the beginning points is dependency foreign by the time God is calling Adam where are you I've gotten a clothing for you Adam already gone ahead and hidden himself and behind the Fig leaves he had already done his own fig leaves says God wants us to depend on him foreign he does not pass through the valley and just looks at it like that he says the valley is dry up the valley is difficult the valley has no way out for me goes ahead and starts to dig a while the word is mentioned once in the Bible if you read in the Bible you will not say it write that one apart from Psalms 84. foreign so in this life we are living in the valley of weapons is the value of the shadow of deaths but what is God telling us blessed is that man who passing through it makes it a well yeah he is not going to say oh the the valley that is so dry up I cannot do anything in it is I like the way the Bible says he says passing through the value foreign [Music] who going through the valley of baka searched for a well yeah and he found it somewhere the Bible says passing through this Valley make it there's an element there make it a well um there is an effort from us an effort from us yes we have to do something I know the days are short I know the days are full of trouble but what are you doing about it Psalms 90 tells us the days are few Ecclesiastes 2 23. 517 these are scriptures you read from home he says the days are full of troubles the life of few days I have plenty of troubles many challenges but what do we do about it the conclusion of the matter is that the road of life is not a simple Road neither is it an easy Road David is referring it to it as a valley of weapons morning for everything but it takes us to do something about it the message the world is falling apart am says a statement like this is okay he says we want just we want everything just according to end up with everything so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy he says life isn't intended to be easy isn't intended to be easy life is a struggle Amina Amina yes sir anything that's got in life so if life is a struggle what are you doing about it David has told you the first thing put your dependence in God that's the beginning bit of it then when you put your dependence on God then God to make the world go to start digging the words in life go to start scratching the ground big adventure get water here the adventure get water therefore get water in the other place but don't sit still glory be to God I mean he says life is not intended to be easy that it's not an easy road but he is there at your back that you depend on him but what are you doing about it he says look at the trees how they struggle according to other guys look at everything that's God's life and when when we try to get some kind of a system that takes it easy then we are wrong we try to make it easy for people together no brother it's just easy don't need to struggle with that try to make it look easy it's never easy the conclusion of it is us out of them Amina that is the conclusion of it the troubles will be there the problems foreign [Music] he says the gift is free now he's talking of Salvation the gift is free that is true but you've got two questions even salvation is freely give an answer but you've got to do something about it you've got to believe it is foreign [Music] you will know how to care foreign [Music] oh glory be to God blessed is that man passing through the valley of baka every time he makes the world he don't sit there and say I don't know how to feed the cattle yeah I don't know how the ship will bring water Lord why have you brought me together and here I'm dying in the wilderness God would have said Abraham what's your problem foreign [Applause] glory be to God and when you hit the water brother you will be able to drink water out of your own sister water out of your own well and we shall seed your cows happy Moon the ship is very healthy moving around the crops are doing very well because there is water nature teaches us these things glory be to God hallelujah hallelujah when God put Adam in the Garden of Eden in Genesis chapter 2 verse 15. listen what the Bible says and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it I remember and to keep it it did not put him in the garden that all have given you now keep eating it eat every food enjoy as you march as you want to that is good that is one aspect of it but there's a responsibility to dress it to prune it vines that are growing wildly like this you cut them down there's a lot of weeds you dig around it it needs water you pour water you do something that the fruits of the trees will be able to feed you [Applause] glory be to God yes sir well so Adam had to do something glory be to God so blessed is that man who digs the world and Solomon adds to read and says and it brings from his own wealth yeah in Genesis chapter 20. I'll try to rush through 20 verse 1 says the South Country and dwelled between Kadesh and should and Sir John Deen yeah and we read we jumped to 21 to 24 from home and Abraham said I will swear verse chapter 21 verse 4. and Abraham repeated because of a well of water which abimelech servants had violently taken away said I want not who have done this thing neither this that would tell me neither yet had eye of it but today [Music] I've just tried to cut just this portion of scriptures what am I going to show here God showing us here Abraham dwelled in the valley of Guerra that belongs and it was there that he settled and what did Abraham do he dug a well for his cattle yes and when he dug the well the Servants of abimelechase who did not want to dig their own Wells who wanted to benefit from some other person as well who wanted to go and draw from the world that Abraham's servants they said we will we need water for our cattle also according to anything and the Servants of Abraham says this world without for our for our culture they said no would they say this is in our land here so it brought a bit of friction and that's it takes us to what we've been reading there electricity so Abraham and and the ability [Music] to continue to use his own words and feed his own cattle and faith is on sheep so the challenge that had come in challenge had wanted to come and steal that well and that is the work of the thief according to John 10 10. when Jesus says so he wanted to take that that well so the pattern was laid there um Abraham to settle in the in the valley of Gerard he had to dig up Wells of water in this Valley of the shadow of death he could keep well so that his cattle should have water so that's his flock should should have water the same we see in in John chapter four when Jesus goes and sits at that well of psycha yes that woman said this is Jacob's Well and that is confirmed in the Old Testament in Genesis chapter 33. you read the scriptures Isaac also went ahead and dubbed well what is the pattern there life is a few days is of troubles we live in a valley of shadow of death very right but what do you do about it go ahead and make words of water that will be able to to keep you well that will be able to sustain you that will be able to keep you going myself in second somewhere chapter 23 here we see here David longing for the water of the wet Waters of him verse 14. and David was in on hold on the girls then in Bethlehem [Applause] and the three Mighty Men break through the host of the Philistines and Brew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David um nevertheless would not drink thereof but powered it out unto the Lord as an offering but David longed for the day of Bethany yeah David in all his frustration back and forth this is in a message he says all this hot day oh it is so hot it's all might come from this way the Philistines from this way around everywhere and here we are sitting in the mouth of a cave and he had the anointing oil on me how can it be how can it be oh I wish I had a drink then his mind goes way down by the gates of the Bethlehem there was aware and that's about the line I wanted his mind went back way up to that world he says there just was no water like that water come out here Palestine had some bad water they have they have evil Waters they have even to block water fever and stuff in them and a lot of its alkaline water which would kill you now imagine Bethlehem is the water seat of the continues and continues so he says he cried for the water from where according to him there was a well that had been dugging and he was so sure that this water from this world is unpolluted it will do him God amen my brother my sister what are you doing about it and start digging the wells I'm not telling you to pick Spades now and you start going in physical life I'm going to dig away it's not digging going to start digging physical world we are going to get it better so David longed for that water of Bethlehem that Samaritan woman in John chapter four sat by that well and Jesus when he came yes he went to the same way and he also SATs I said woman give me some water water from where water from that way yo bring waters from your own world and he knew that word was done by the Patriots so he wanted to drink that same water Diego in Ecclesiastes he says something like this Ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse 10. he says whatsoever by hand findeth to do um do it with thy might go for there is no work no device no knowledge where that will go West Georgia so when do you have the opportunity to do it that's the question I'm trying to answer now here when do we dig the wells whatsoever thy hand findeth today he says do it with thy might because when you go down in the graves there's no work no knowledge no wisdom no nothing too all that will have ceased when is the opportunity [Music] we're not still walking this Valley of the shadow of death you know when we're still walking this time get the opportunity and do it verse 11 continues and he says I returned and I saw Under the Sun the rest is not to the Swift not the battle to the strong Empire [Music] neither bread to the wise foreign foreign mixed yourself up Let me read it slowly he says I returned and so under the sun that for me I don't have understanding foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] there is an opportunity foreign [Applause] so we all have opportunities Amina Amina say no to Satan standing commanding do not take that which God has given me now [Applause] has been given to us the Ecclesiastes says [Applause] do it with your mind I like the way he says what does finding means foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign oh glory be to God we need to look at it we mean search for all these things let me read the quote here what brother Branham says in the message proving his word he says but remember he keeps all of his promises of blessings as well as he does his castings the same way he remembers the curses it's the same way he remembers the blessings so because they eat their roof welcome back that day they died and he proves it to you that they do die that they they eat their roles that is right he also keeps every word he said about his blessings this is the message proving his words he keeps every word about his blessings every promise oh I love that he says you have to choose which one you want [Applause] you have to choose I will not choose for you the pastor will not choose foreign glory be to God yes sir he says his Blessings by believing oh his cursings by perverting it you choose Salah if you pervert it and believe the perversion side of it then you are cast you are blessed foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign people's scientific way of showing things he says for he keeps every word both of his blessings and I believe in the blessings don't know Amina stepped into the promises hold on to that which God has given you and dig the world [Music] both spiritually Memorial yes the blessings given to us in all ways and we must claim it oh brother Michael you're preaching some Prosperity yes I'm saying because it's part of the world Amina Amina he was not left outside there oh brother Branham says that the majority of Christians that is foreign [Music] would you imagine a little foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] could you imagine a little mouse under that great Gunners of Egypt saying I just better ate a few grains each day [Music] because it might not last through the winter wonderland he could never eat it in a thousand lifetimes and listen now neither can you off the blessing that God's laid up for you if you live 10 million years here on Earth what's God say if you live there for 10 million years that's how much that's how much God has given us God has given you that wonderful question is foreign [Applause] [Applause] shall take place we believe it in the spiritual but we fear in the physicals yeah even if you buy a Jet Plane tomorrow I will not fear everything I'm not I'm now not saying we got the audition way the pressure the burden is for the wealth instead of Christ in them they'll say that I'm rich not your naked miserable wretched and blind Amina so I'm not saying you're going that to extreme if you live for 10 million years the blessings of God he says there will still be plenty of blessings left for you oh he is glory to his name when you plant yourself in him by this Fountain it's like the Traders planted by the rivers of water how glorious and how he likes to push forth His blessings [Applause] give them abundance [Applause] [Music] how he does what oh yeah he likes that is the desire of God you resist and say no God I don't need it so much I don't need it but you can never exhaust God so if you say God that I don't need it enough then be contented and settle down but if you are not contented then open up for the blessings of God one of the doors you will open like this and Waters will gush over yours don't sit and wait Proverbs 13 11 says proverbs 13. says worth gotten by Vanity gambo shall be what is be diminished but he that gathereth by labor shall increase by words he that findeth something today that was gotten by vanities that's why Christians we are not in for gambling but this which you do with your hands you make the world [Applause] you shall increase shall grow from strength to strength opportunities I mean Ecclesiastes say something like this is 5 18 to 20. eternal behold that which I have seen it is good and calmly for one to eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he taketh Under the Sun all the days of his life which God giveth him for it is his portion is Amina Amina one of the the castings um that God always gave Israeli you will plant but you'll notice someone will come and have the States you will build but you will not stay in it the devil will bring someone else to inhabitate when they left the world that was a class but when you plant I was sick and you ate while yeah it's a blessing it is your portion in life so why are you afraid to plant Amina Amina why are you afraid to plant I'm not talking of the planting of the Pentecostals now hey where they tell you Seekers we know the principles not talking of that so why are we afraid to plants he says that is your portion that is what God has purposed for you and you bring out of that word that is your portion in life non-believers sometimes believe these things better than us recognize this principles this is God's word if they recognized and are benefiting from it what about we the children of the house it is time for us to apply the scriptures how do we apply it work in those scriptures he says every month to verse 19 and also to whom God has given riches and wealth and has given him power to each their own take his passion and to rejoice in his labor read that last portion it says it says what this is the gift of God receive your gift Church receive your gifts receive your blessings they are yours they know they are not mine let the devil not deny you them this is mine and I claim it tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus [Applause] Jesus Christ not only the spiritual blessings even the physical blessings for he shall not much remember the days of his life answered him in the joy of his heart you will not go down the grave weeping crying and casting life was hard foreign [Applause] huh [Applause] [Applause] I don't want the life here after to be just a consolation your brother we are so badly here [Applause] shouldn't be a consolation be happy here the way you'll be happy he says [Applause] Amina Amina yes sir take the word of God receive the blessings they are yours they are my inheritance they are your inheritance oh glory be to God and may read you a scripture here let's go to the book of let's read psalms 144. foreign verse 11 to 15. Hallelujah [Applause] listen to Psalms 144. it says read me and Deliver Me from the hand of strange children Psalms 144 verse 11. foreign Arizona everything we need in there is in the store that our ship may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets many guys that our oxen may be strong to laborers that is no going out that there be no complaining in our streets are and he concludes it by saying happy Valley ah foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] whose God is the Lord now people always liked reading the last part of each other whose God is the Lord how happy are those people they are Gunners for thousands and thousands foreign [Applause] that's what the message has been given foreign when I came in yesterday because the promises [Applause] [Applause] foreign foreign [Laughter] we are not going to compete with them of course oh that will build five stories we are going to make our square roof no we are not going to compete because they have a worldless spirit in them we shall use ours right today for the service of God we shall run to every village because God will give us a transportation [Applause] glory be to God Proverbs 14. listen to one thing here what causes the problem I can't finish but I'm going to close things of my desire Amina listen what Solomon says read it and complete it is foreign exactly how everybody [Laughter] so you keep the oxen out and then you keep them don't have food but God will give us Grace is Grace going to feed you is Grace going to give your food Grace is not going to give your food get that Ox bring it inside [Applause] camera [Applause] Amina Amina so people don't want that part of it and you want to keep the crib cleaning you'll be there like that brother sister sister where there is no oxen president the crib is clean I mean so if I come I found a crib a clean crib I'll not waste time much I'll just say God bless my brother I know there's no Planet there is no food I mean but where there is food I'll find the crib is very dirty a lot of the auction is working I'm not saying now keep your houses yeah you don't keep the house dirty but you have proof that they are making money [Laughter] I mean glory be to God he says but much increase comes by the strength of the Oaks so what are you using the Oaks so if you've just tied it somewhere around two that is what you'll get yeah your Ox is just tied there but me might have not died I mean it is plowing here I put jelly cans of water it brings water for the homes foreign this is the Bible [Laughter] Arena I mean yes sir wow all these things are in the words but we sometimes don't we look much in the spirituality which is correct and good but I'm now making it to balance be spiritually happy as well as physically happy I mean when they said there's a church service tomorrow everybody comes everybody has the ability when they say there's an overnight everybody comes they have the ability support the missionary everybody because they have their business sending out people to preach we have the ability foreign but you're going to church but you are the most miserable person you're coming to church most miserable person what's your problem you're so tired Amina Amina believe God's word thank God that his words he is more than able he is more than 80. brother live for big things it's the way you believe for small things [Applause] foreign I'm not going to I may not finish it it's long but I'm going to just close with a few scriptures here guys say he's here two verse seven to nine he says and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house with the glory say it the Lord of hosts come on [Music] again we take the spiritual aspect of it yeah even the physical aspect of it is you now know the answer you now know the cause of it God says when all this is in place my people are happy and happy are those people whose God is the Lord when all these things are there is peace because there is peace Hallelujah this is the word [Music] um it's something I wanted here I'll leave that so what does he want us to do because let me just conclude in the message where I think Pentecost failed he says he says he wants us to ask and believe it that our Joys would be full get that quote brother where I think Pentecost fell San Fernando 1955 Amina Amina he wants us but when they say let's shout and jump to the Lord women look at the song leader yeah you feel so offended abundance when your joy is full there's always [Music] I mean he says he wants you to ask abandoned them [Applause] ask for big things don't limit your face is the foundation against the beginning point Have Faith as small as they must have said yeah so don't stay there [Music] and we must go higher than that glory be to God yes sir he says get on out here to some other kind of faith and move out in big things that's what the Bible says you shall fight I mean Amina big things is just as easy we
