[17:07] Christ let us ourselves and pray father
[17:11] in the name of our Lord Jesus
[17:13] Christ we thank you for this
[17:16] evening the grace that you've given unto
[17:18] us to come into your presence
[17:21] Lord you said where two or three are
[17:23] gathered in your
[17:25] name you will be there in their midst
[17:29] and Lord we believe you are here
[17:32] Lord we praise that you may bless every
[17:35] one of
[17:36] us and you may speak to us in such
[17:39] special
[17:40] alone and they are all the prayers of
[17:42] your
[17:44] children PR upon this
[17:47] service in the name of the Lord
[17:51] Jesus amen let us go to the Book of
[17:54] Romans chapter 8
[17:59] Romans chapter
[18:02] 8 we're reading from verse 26 to verse
[18:11] 27 so the Bible
[18:13] says likewise the spirit also helps our
[18:17] infirmities for we know not what we
[18:20] should pray for as we ought but the
[18:24] spirit itself makes
[18:26] intercession for us with groaning which
[18:29] cannot be uttered and he that searches
[18:31] the hearts knows what is the mind of the
[18:34] spirit because he makes intercession for
[18:37] the Saints according to the will of God
[19:23] may we just want to continue with the
[19:26] subject we had last Wednesday
[19:32] but this time we want to call it the
[19:33] intercession of the Holy
[19:40] Spirit praise the name of the Lord the
[19:43] holy spirit intercedes for
[19:46] us praise the name of our Lord last
[19:50] wedes were talking about the comforter
[19:52] has
[19:56] come praise the name of the Lord
[19:59] and the
[20:00] comforter we saw is actually the spirit
[20:03] of the
[20:06] truth which is the Holy
[20:09] Spirit and then the word Comfort
[20:12] also means
[20:16] anate the one who stands on your
[20:20] side the one who pleads for
[20:23] you praise the name of our Lord and so
[20:27] we want to see that the holy
[20:30] spirit intercedes for us praise the name
[20:34] of our Lord and you know the Holy
[20:38] Spirit takes our
[20:41] place praise the name of our Lord the
[20:44] Bible has told
[20:47] us that the holy spirit makes
[20:51] intercession for
[20:55] us with the groanings which can not be
[21:01] uttered praise the name of the Lord and
[21:04] then he says he intercedes for us
[21:06] according to our
[21:11] weaknesses our
[21:14] infirmities our
[21:16] failures praise the name of the Lord so
[21:18] that the Holy Spirit comes and works in
[21:21] our
[21:23] lives and then he identifies the
[21:25] different weaknesses that we have
[21:29] and then
[21:31] intercedes praise the name of the Lord
[21:34] and then we see that the intercession
[21:39] work is continuous until you know the
[21:42] rupture takes
[21:46] place praise the name of our Lord until
[21:49] Christ takes the whole
[21:52] possession when Christ claims all that
[21:55] he has redeemed
[21:59] praise the name of our Lord but right
[22:01] now is interceding for
[22:04] us and you know brother Bram
[22:07] says that the
[22:09] prayers praise the name of Lord of the
[22:13] Saints you know they have to pass
[22:16] through
[22:17] Christ or it's by the blood of Jesus
[22:21] Christ that you know we have all these
[22:26] intercessions praise the name of our
[22:28] Lord
[22:30] for
[22:31] us praise the name of our Lord Blood on
[22:34] the
[22:36] altar you know helping us in our
[22:41] infirmities praise the name of our
[22:44] Lord so brother Bram
[22:49] says in the 50th
[22:55] seal he says
[23:01] notice this
[23:04] now now if there is no altar of
[23:07] sacrifice in
[23:11] heaven where is the sacri sacrifice for
[23:14] sin laying
[23:18] then
[23:20] L there has to be a place where the
[23:23] slain lamb
[23:29] blood is laying
[23:33] there where the
[23:35] blood now the
[23:41] incense was the ous
[23:45] stuff that they
[23:48] B which the Bible said was the prayers
[23:52] of the
[23:55] Saints if there isn't No sacrifice on
[23:58] the
[24:01] altar then the prayers cannot be
[24:06] received it's only by the
[24:09] blood on the sacrificial
[24:14] altar that lets the prayers go through
[24:18] to
[24:21] God praise the name of the Lord we see
[24:24] we have a
[24:26] privilege what the Bible says that we
[24:29] have boldness
[24:31] now that we can go to the holies of
[24:34] holies by the blood of Jesus
[24:38] Christ so we have
[24:41] access the door has not been
[24:45] closed praise the name of our Lord and
[24:48] you see that the Gospel of Jesus
[24:50] Christ it was it has always been an Open
[24:56] Door praise the name of our Lord it has
[24:59] always been an open
[25:01] door it's the person
[25:04] themselves who says I'm not
[25:09] worthy that's what the scripture says
[25:12] that those who were bidden to
[25:15] [Music]
[25:21] come and they did not
[25:24] come they were
[25:27] unworthy they consider themselves not
[25:31] worthy the way Paul Wasing to the
[25:35] Jews we've been sent to preach to you
[25:37] the
[25:40] gospel in the book of Acts
[25:45] 13 in verse
[25:49] 46 then Paul and Barabas worked B and
[25:52] said it was necessary that the word of
[25:55] God should first have been spoken to you
[25:58] but seeing you put it from you and judge
[26:02] yourselves
[26:04] Unworthy of everlasting life LA turn to
[26:08] the
[26:24] Gentiles praise the name of the Lord he
[26:27] says we pre come to preach to
[26:29] you declare you that the door is
[26:33] open deare to you that there is
[26:35] forgiveness of
[26:37] sin that the sacrifice still on the
[26:41] altar but now you have rejected it then
[26:45] you count yourselves
[26:48] unworthy praise the name of our Lord so
[26:52] we should count
[26:55] ourselves that we are worthy
[26:59] because Christ has given us the
[27:01] gospel praise the name of our Lord
[27:04] that's what makes us
[27:06] worthy because he says come unto me you
[27:09] are
[27:11] Heaven I will give you
[27:14] rest praise the name of our Lord so you
[27:17] don't cut off
[27:19] yourself that's why the Bible is telling
[27:23] us we have a high
[27:26] priest praise the name of our Lord
[27:29] who maketh intercession for the
[27:34] Saints according to the will of
[27:40] God praise the name of the Lord in
[27:43] Hebrews 7 verse
[27:49] 24 says but this man because he
[27:52] continues ever has unchangeable
[27:55] priesthood
[28:07] 24 wherefore he is able also to serve
[28:11] them to the atmost that come unto God by
[28:15] him seeing he ever liveth to make
[28:18] intercession for them
[28:24] [Music]
[28:36] praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[28:38] says he ever
[28:42] liveth and why is he ever
[28:45] living to to to intercede for
[28:49] us and then the Bible
[28:52] says he wants to save
[28:56] us the
[28:59] most in other words our complete
[29:02] [Music]
[29:05] Redemption until nobody of us can sin
[29:10] anymore until we have no more
[29:14] weaknesses so now in the time when we
[29:16] have
[29:18] weaknesses he says I'm interceding for
[29:21] you praise the name of our Lord that's
[29:24] the confidence that we should
[29:26] have that once accepted the Lord Jesus
[29:29] as my personal
[29:32] Savior and then his Spirit lives within
[29:36] me then the holy spirit is in our life
[29:41] to help us in our
[29:44] weaknesses to help us overcome our
[29:51] failures that's why is a high
[29:54] priest up
[29:58] this is where I'm having
[30:00] failures and then you believe in him to
[30:03] help you in your
[30:07] weaknesses praise the name of our Lord
[30:10] in the message proving his
[30:13] word the Bible
[30:16] said the
[30:18] Bible Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[30:21] today and
[30:24] forever he says he a high priest
[30:29] sitting there making intercessions Upon
[30:32] Our
[30:37] confession we have to confess it
[30:41] first before he can be a high
[30:44] priest praise the name of Lord says we
[30:48] have to confess
[30:50] it what you want him to intercede for
[30:54] you you know just like when you have an
[30:57] advocate
[30:59] you tell the advocate all your
[31:04] issues and then the ADV T your
[31:08] issues before the judge so now we tell
[31:12] God we tell God all our
[31:16] weaknesses and then Christ intercedes on
[31:19] our
[31:21] behalf and he says intered on our
[31:25] confessions
[31:28] we have to confess it
[31:32] first before he can be a high
[31:36] priest because he only intered to our
[31:42] confession is that right he only inters
[31:46] Upon Our
[31:51] confession what we
[31:54] confess that he
[31:56] is what what he has done for
[31:59] us not what he will
[32:02] do he has already done
[32:05] it we have to confess that he's done
[32:10] it he's wounded for our
[32:17] transgressions withes were
[32:20] healed praise the name of so we confess
[32:23] to
[32:25] Christ and then when we confess to
[32:28] Christ then he intercedes based on our
[32:34] confession amen aen then in the message
[32:38] why brother Bram says that's the same
[32:42] thing with Divine
[32:49] Healing you don't I see people all
[32:53] worked up
[32:58] and try to get nervous and
[33:02] saying or if I
[33:05] could know you got over the top of
[33:14] it you leave it behind
[33:17] you you are going out
[33:20] there excited and trying to reach for
[33:23] something
[33:27] right there by
[33:30] you just
[33:32] simple just say thank
[33:35] you Father you promised it to
[33:39] me I now receive
[33:43] it for my
[33:46] healing what is he Christ is the high
[33:49] priest of our
[33:54] confession he the high priest of our
[33:56] confession
[33:59] then he can do one thing for
[34:02] you can make no intercession until you
[34:05] first conf that it's
[34:10] done is that
[34:12] scripture high priest of our
[34:16] confession then he can only act when we
[34:22] confess praise the name of our Lord and
[34:24] then he continues to say now if you say
[34:27] Lord I lost the joy of my
[34:32] salvation I want you I stayed away from
[34:34] prayer
[34:37] meeting wednes night will find me right
[34:41] back or Tuesday whatever it
[34:45] is I'll be right
[34:47] back all
[34:49] right mean
[34:51] that believe it say I have confessed I'm
[34:55] wrong
[34:58] now start working on
[35:01] it start Christ starts interceding for
[35:06] you I'm sorry that I sinned
[35:09] Lord I'm going to be a Christian from
[35:12] now
[35:14] on then see you made your
[35:19] confession start right on
[35:24] it if you are sick say Lord you are my
[35:27] healer
[35:30] if I sin to cause this to come upon me
[35:33] forgive
[35:36] me Lord I'm taking you at your
[35:41] word you said you would heal
[35:44] me I believe it you are the high priest
[35:48] of My
[35:50] Confession now I'm confessing that by
[35:54] your stripes I was healed
[35:59] you are the high priest of My
[36:02] Confession now I'm confess your stripes
[36:05] I was
[36:08] healed thank you Lord go right
[36:13] on see then he can go to work on know
[36:17] that God
[36:19] is and God is a
[36:23] rewarder those that diligently seek him
[36:28] praise the name of our Lord so you must
[36:31] have
[36:32] confidence that when you
[36:35] confess because you are confessing based
[36:37] on the Promises of
[36:40] God so you take the
[36:44] claims and then brother Bram says the
[36:47] Holy
[36:48] Spirit enforces those
[36:53] promises make sure that they come to
[36:56] pass
[36:57] praise the name of our Lord so we have
[37:00] the high
[37:01] priest who is touched by the feeling of
[37:03] our
[37:05] infirmities praise the name of our Lord
[37:08] in Romans
[37:12] 8:3 the Bible says who shall lay
[37:16] anything to the charge of God is elect
[37:19] it is God that justifi
[37:32] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[37:35] that died yeah rather that is risen
[37:38] again who is even at the right hand of
[37:40] God who also maketh intercession for us
[38:05] shall separate us from the love of
[38:07] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[38:11] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[38:14] Peril or sword
[38:34] as it is written for thy sake are we
[38:36] killed all day long we are counted as
[38:39] sheep for
[38:53] Slaughter now in all these things we are
[38:56] more than us through him that loved
[39:07] us for I am persuaded that neither death
[39:12] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[39:16] nor powers nor things present nor things
[39:19] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[39:23] other creature shall be able to separate
[39:25] us from the love of God which is in
[39:27] Christ Jesus our lord
[39:35] [Music]
[40:06] amen praise the name of our Lord he says
[40:09] nothing shall separate us from the word
[40:11] love of
[40:14] God he says we are more than
[40:18] conquerors through our Lord Jesus
[40:21] Christ so then we have to yield all our
[40:24] lives to the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:28] you surrender all your life unto
[40:31] him and allow him to take over all your
[40:34] life to take over all your
[40:38] desires to take over all your
[40:41] mind praise the name of our Lord the
[40:44] Lord can take
[40:47] over and then in your
[40:49] weaknesses the Bible says the holy
[40:52] spirit makes intercession for
[40:55] us so in the mid of all our
[40:59] challenges we have a high
[41:02] priest praise the name of our Lord who
[41:04] is Ever standing
[41:06] there to help us praise the name of our
[41:10] Lord every rest that we have so then you
[41:15] allow him to take over your
[41:19] condition praise the name of our in
[41:22] Hebrews chter
[41:24] 4 and then in verse 14
[41:29] the Bible says seeing then that we have
[41:31] a great high priest that is passed into
[41:34] the heavens Jesus the son of God let us
[41:38] hold our
[41:50] profession the Bible says let us hold
[41:54] first our profession
[41:59] what is your
[42:01] confession what would you want the Lord
[42:03] to do for
[42:05] you because each of us has different
[42:09] station so you tell the Lord this is my
[42:13] need this is my
[42:15] weak like our Lord Jesus Christ wherever
[42:19] he went you would ask them what would
[42:22] you want me to do for
[42:25] you the Le I want to be
[42:28] clean and he would make them
[42:31] clean I want to
[42:33] walk and make them walk every person had
[42:37] their own
[42:39] weaknesses and based on their confession
[42:42] and desire for
[42:48] help Christ would help them according to
[42:50] their
[42:53] need Christ is the same yesterday today
[42:56] and forever
[42:59] even us to help us on our
[43:02] needs to help us in our
[43:05] weaknesses praise the name of our Lord
[43:08] so he ever leaveth to make intercession
[43:10] for
[43:12] us now in verse 15 the Bible
[43:16] says for we have not a high priest which
[43:18] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[43:22] our infirmities but was in all points
[43:25] tempted like we are yet without
[43:40] sin praise the name of our Lord says he
[43:43] a high
[43:45] priest who is
[43:48] touched you know he has
[43:52] compassion he sympathizes with us he is
[43:56] concerned about our
[43:58] Affairs so then you tell him your
[44:02] condition Lord this is my
[44:06] weakness and the infirmities here the
[44:08] Bible is talking
[44:10] about says he touched with the feeling
[44:12] of our
[44:19] infirmities
[44:21] weaknesses and spiritual
[44:25] weaknesses praise the name of
[44:27] so he is touched by all our
[44:32] weaknesses our weaknesses in these
[44:34] bodies Our weaknesses in the
[44:38] soul so then you confess it to
[44:41] him Lord this is where the devil is
[44:43] taking a hold of my
[44:46] life and God wants to know that you are
[44:49] also concerned about your
[44:53] weakness so then you confess it to him
[44:56] and then the Bible says he is
[45:00] touched praise the name of the Lord and
[45:03] then he confesses
[45:05] it praise the name of our Lord the high
[45:08] priest of our
[45:11] confession so inters for US based on our
[45:17] confession praise the name of our so
[45:20] then he says let us therefore come
[45:22] boldly unto the throne of grace
[45:27] that we may obtain
[45:30] mercy and find Grace in the time of
[45:37] need praise the name of our Lord he says
[45:40] come
[45:42] boldly don't come with
[45:44] fear come depending on
[45:47] Christ not depending upon
[45:50] yourself one thing we need to know is
[45:52] what does the Lord want me to do in this
[45:54] kind of situation
[45:58] and then you come by the word of
[46:02] God the Lord wants you to address that
[46:05] kind of condition in your
[46:09] life Lord this is my
[46:12] weakness this is my failure I depending
[46:16] upon you to help me out of this
[46:20] condition depending upon you to deliver
[46:22] me from this kind of
[46:25] situation so you confessing
[46:28] it you are presenting it before the high
[46:32] priest and then brother Bram
[46:35] says
[46:36] believe that the Lord is going to handle
[46:39] that
[46:41] issue praise the name of our Lord like
[46:44] our
[46:46] Salvation you have to believe that you
[46:49] are
[46:52] saved if you don't believe that you are
[46:54] saved
[46:57] then you as well you are
[46:58] out but you have to believe
[47:02] it that I am
[47:05] saved why do I believe that I'm
[47:07] saved because I've done what the word
[47:10] requires me to
[47:13] do praise the name of the Lord so even
[47:16] our
[47:17] healing by his stripes I was
[47:20] healed so you also believe that he has
[47:23] healed
[47:24] you and then you don't allow the
[47:26] negative
[47:27] to come in your
[47:30] mind healed it's not for me to be
[47:34] healed praise the name of our Lord
[47:37] Brother talks about
[47:40] pardon and then he talks about a man who
[47:42] was taken in
[47:45] prison during the time of Abraham
[47:50] LOL and then when a friend went and
[47:52] talked to the
[47:55] president and then for
[47:58] him then the president wrote on
[48:03] AER and said this one is
[48:07] pardoned and this man ran to the
[48:12] prison told him the president has
[48:14] pardoned
[48:16] you and then he say it is
[48:19] here now what this man was looking
[48:22] for where is the seat of the president
[48:26] where is the where is the stamp of the
[48:31] president he didn't believe the
[48:33] pardon the foll he was
[48:37] executed when it went to
[48:39] court then they said that a
[48:43] pardon is not a
[48:45] pardon until it is
[48:49] accepted the name of our Lord so we also
[48:52] have to believe our
[48:55] pardon we have to believe the
[48:57] Forgiveness of our
[49:00] sins we have to believe the healing of
[49:03] our
[49:04] bodies we have to believe the salvation
[49:07] of our
[49:09] souls whatever he has promised us you
[49:13] say Lord I believe it Lord I receive it
[49:18] and that's how the Holy Ghost can
[49:19] intercede for
[49:22] us because we are believing what the
[49:24] Holy Spirit has told us through the word
[49:29] praise the name of the Lord so then he
[49:31] says come
[49:33] boldly to the throne of
[49:36] grace that you may obtain
[49:39] mercy and Grace to help in the time of
[49:44] need praise the name of our Lord we go
[49:47] to Hebrews 2:
[49:52] 17 the Bible
[49:55] says wherefore in all things it behooved
[49:58] him to be made like unto his Brethren
[50:01] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[50:04] high priest in the things pertaining to
[50:07] God to make reconciliation for the sins
[50:11] of the people
[50:36] for for in that he himself has suffered
[50:40] being tempted he's able to sucker them
[50:43] that are
[50:55] tempted praise the name of our he says
[50:58] he was also
[51:01] tempted so he's able also to
[51:07] [Music]
[51:10] help is able to suer
[51:14] them in other words to bring
[51:18] assistance you know in our
[51:21] weaknesses when we are
[51:23] tempted then he comes and helps
[51:27] you you see the Bible says that there's
[51:31] no temptation that takes
[51:34] you than what God knows that you are
[51:37] able to
[51:40] withand and then he says in every
[51:43] Temptation he always makes a way of
[51:49] Escape that is how he helps
[51:52] us that's how he comes and assists us
[51:57] he becomes our
[52:00] Advocate praise the name of our Lord he
[52:02] gives us the
[52:04] strength when we are weak praise the
[52:07] name of our Lord so we need to depend
[52:10] upon
[52:11] God praise the name of our Lord to do
[52:14] his work in our
[52:18] lives that he can help us at all the
[52:21] time so you can depend upon him
[52:26] the Bible says is a
[52:30] merciful and faithful high
[52:34] priest he's here to make reconciliation
[52:36] for our
[52:39] sins to bring us back to
[52:42] line to bring us to the image of
[52:46] God praise the name of our Lord so we
[52:49] need to yield to the Holy
[52:52] Spirit and allow the spirit of God to
[52:56] completely take over all our
[52:59] lives praise the name of our Lord in
[53:03] Hebrews chapter 5 verse 1
[53:07] verse3 the scripture says for every high
[53:11] priest taken from among men is ordained
[53:14] for men in things pertaining to God that
[53:17] he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
[53:20] for
[53:40] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[53:42] and on them that are out of the way for
[53:45] that he himself also is compassed with
[53:48] infirmity
[53:56] [Music]
[54:04] praise the name of the Lord it says the
[54:08] priesthood the priesthood of
[54:11] Levi there were men born in
[54:15] sin they
[54:18] weaknesses so the Bible says they have
[54:24] compassion because they also go through
[54:26] the the same
[54:29] challenges praise the name of the Lord
[54:32] they had
[54:33] compassion those who are
[54:37] ignorant they don't know anything left
[54:39] or
[54:41] right like people who have never
[54:43] accepted the Lord Jesus as their
[54:45] personal
[54:47] Savior and they they have compassion
[54:50] upon
[54:51] them so that they can turn out of the
[54:54] evil way
[54:57] that they can walk in the way of Truth
[54:58] and
[55:00] righteousness but then there are also
[55:02] those who know the
[55:06] truth but then they go
[55:10] asay you know they go off the
[55:14] line so they has compassion on those who
[55:17] are
[55:19] ignorant and even those who are out of
[55:22] the
[55:24] way so that they can be br brought back
[55:27] into the F of
[55:30] Christ so now the
[55:33] priesthood is to intercede for the
[55:36] weaknesses of the
[55:39] people to bring reconciliation between
[55:42] man and
[55:45] God the Holy Ghost does this in our
[55:50] lives the name of our Lord bring us that
[55:54] we can be able to stand in the presence
[55:57] of
[55:59] God now in first John chapter
[56:03] 2 and then verse
[56:06] one he says my little children the
[56:08] things right I unto you that you sin not
[56:12] and if any man sin we have an advocate
[56:15] with the father Jesus Christ the
[56:18] righteous
[56:32] praise the name of our Lord we have an
[56:37] advocate our Lord Jesus
[56:40] Christ so he says don't
[56:43] s but when
[56:46] somebodys that's not the end of the
[56:49] person says we have an
[56:54] advocate praise the name of the Lord
[56:56] so you don't allow your sttion to hold
[56:59] you
[57:01] back from The Fellowship of the Holy
[57:06] Spirit but then you bring it before God
[57:09] and say Lord this is where my weakness
[57:13] is this is where I'm
[57:16] failing you allow the Holy
[57:19] Spirit take over that
[57:24] weakness praise the name of the Lord
[57:27] you know we had a
[57:30] sister that's
[57:34] after and then she came to study from
[57:38] one of the schools
[57:42] around and then she ended up missing
[57:44] herself in the
[57:48] school not
[57:58] and she stopped coming to
[58:01] church when they asked her said I'm
[58:06] dirty but how long will you be dirty
[58:09] outside
[58:11] there and she didn't come back till she
[58:15] left but here the Bible
[58:18] says we have an
[58:21] advocate you don't allow Satan to hold
[58:24] you back there
[58:28] continuous condemnation
[58:30] there and then you don't come and say
[58:33] Lord have mercy
[58:36] upon so he says if any person
[58:40] sin we have an advocate with the
[58:44] father verse then he
[58:46] says and is the pration for our
[58:52] sins and not only ours only
[58:57] but also for the sins of the whole
[59:01] world praise the name of the Lord so we
[59:05] have an
[59:07] advocate so whatever one go
[59:11] through Christ is ready to forgive us of
[59:15] any
[59:17] failures you just bring it before the
[59:20] Lord praise the name of our Lord
[59:22] whatever weakness is

[59:52] the son of man has set free
[59:58] he's free
[59:59] indeed praise the name of our Lord

[1:00:46] weaknesses will keep on
[1:00:48] coming one thing is constantly put them

[1:01:33] things and brother said how can this
[1:01:36] thing
[1:01:38] happen in his heart saying how can my
[1:01:40] children be raised in this kind
[1:01:45] of then the Lord told him come out and I
[1:01:47] show you
[1:01:49] something and then he
[1:01:52] showed you know brother Bram
[1:01:56] and brother would make mistakes or do
[1:01:57] things which are
[1:02:00] wrong and then he s those things
[1:02:04] actually you know they were going before
[1:02:07] God but Christ was there receiving them
[1:02:10] as a
[1:02:13] bum and then he said Lord
[1:02:16] for
[1:02:17] for continuous interceding for his
[1:02:22] weaknesses praise the name of our Lord
[1:02:25] great Preacher Brother Bram talks

[1:03:12] all that he has done all that he
[1:03:17] did I stand for him praise the name of
[1:03:21] our Lord we have a high priest of our
[1:03:24] confession
