amen thank God for the little let's give them of PR have to be careful what their little mind thinks amen what they touch where they go everywhere praise the Lord so are you here this morning can we go into the word amen let's stand up and go to the reading of the scripture we've got quite a number of uh uh group that are joining us later today so that we can enjoy amen our day of worship and praise amen so many of these songs that have been written and brother jrey amen he was just singing about his calling WR very wonderful music amen let's just to the Book of [Music] Psalms 100se before we read the scripture let us B heads in a word of prayer father in the name of Jesus we come before your presence fully consec created Lord for the purpose that you may speak to us we pray that you may come down that you may use this verse of clay to speak to souls that you love so much that you bought them with your own life us father speaking such a way Lord that your word may go the right spots of our heart that you may hide them there father that you may anoint them with the holy spirit that as we keep walking along this PM Journey we keep picking out the Fulfillment saying that this Day scripture has been fulfill me the needs of your people father we commit the in Jesus name amen so Psalms verse4 I'm speaking to you for about an hour amen and verse four he says enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and it SC with praise may the Lord blessing the reading of his word you may be seated so today I've got a thought that I want to speak on I want to title it the mind of the word on worship and music the mind of the word in other words what the word says about worship and music now holy ghost music is to God and God Alone is the one that is worshiped in our SS and if one performs the song it will certainly open flood gates of Jo to the singer heart you feel so good you just enter into the gates but at the end of it we must be humble enough not share in the glory it brings because the glory should be going to God and God so one thing to note is that music is a gift and therefore every musician is a steward because the the the the the the the music in itself is a gift and every man who holds the gift of God is a steward we shall take a little visit to the book of ezek and you wonder why I would pick eel now but let's go to Ezekiel 28 the king of Tyrus was an embodiment of Lucifer you know just like the Antichrist in the Book of Revelation so God in eel 28 addresses the king of Tyrus like he was addressing the Devil Himself you see if God ever had to speak to me I would rather he speaks to me like he's speaking to his own son amen if he chooses to correct me I'll say thank you Lord if he chooses to rebuke me I say Lord have mercy upon me I wouldn't want God to speak to me like he was speaking to the Devil Himself he was speaking to a man whose heart was lifted up the heart was full of Pride he claimed to be equal to God you know a man who had inflated himself by a gift which God had given to him so he was not a good sewer he had a gift the gift was to give praise to God but he wanted to turn that gift that the rest of the Angels would also use it to praise him we must be careful always to keep the boundaries when God gives us the gifts so eel 2 and verse 12 he a son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him th says the Lord thou seest up the s full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty when it comes to Beauty and wisdom he seals up the you know he seals up the P there could not be any better creation than Lucifer words he was endowed with rare Beauty and he was endowed with wisdom until God himself say he seals up the beauty seals up the amen th been in the now I want you to see how is addressing this King here amen he speaking to him like he is addressing the devil meaning that if one is not careful he can be an embodiment of evil amen but by the grace of God we are the embodiment of the Holy Ghost amen he tells the king of tyus thou Hast been in Eden which was not literally right but he was addressing the spirit that embodied in this man th been ined the garden of God every precious stone was th C the S the to he counts them all amen and he says at the end of the I mean of the verse and thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day thou was created Garden Of God using the serpent but now you are using the embodiment of the king of tus so you know he was describing and it was only a stone or two a stone of beauty away from the entire glory of God so the workmanship of your Tabet and of your pipes was prepared in you the day you were created so he was created to see gifts and callings gifts and callings are without repentance God gives them to you even before you were born or formed in your mother's but when the gifts begins to operate we must be careful that we become faithful stewards to this gift to know why the gift is given the gift is not given to praise yourself no the gift was given to minister to God so every gift that we shall ever get getting from God is for the purpose that it ministers to the body of Christ amen so it's not me that Praises myself Amen in verse 14 Thou Art the anointed cherub that cover and I have set thee Soul thou upon the holy mountain of God I don't want it to be said I was on the mountain of the Holy Mountain of God I want it to be said that I am in the Holy Mountain of I don't want to become an history in any service that I do to God Amen that you have walked up and down in the midst of the storms of fire I don't want it to be said like it is said in verse 15 thou was perfect in thy ways I pray that God may give me Grace that he should always be Sav that I am perfect in my way and if I find anything that subtracts my perfection let me realize that God left the blood behind let us make use of the Fountain of blood when you see any kind of St go down and submerge under the fountain amen was perfect in thy ways from the day thou was created till iniquity was found in there amen iniquity was found in the now iniquity is fully knowing what you should do but for your own desire you bypass what you know should be done and do what you think will please you better amen God's word is perfect God's word is absolute God's word is final and that word comes our away we should always say amen amen Lucifer was anointed and perfect and the power of his gift was built in him on the day of creation but what lifted up his heart verse 17 tells us that the gift lifted up his heart every gift God gives us must be used in humility that's what God wants but verse 17 here he says th heart was lifted up because of th Beauty who gave him the beauty God gave him the beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness who gave him that brightness God gave him that bright so the things God ended him with caused him a proud heart Sons and Daughters of God very important that when God gives you a good car God gives you a good house God gives you a good education God gives you a good Ministry gift we should know that that's a responsibility that makes us more submissive Rising above our brothers are you together with me so we need to be good stewards whatever gift we have should declare the goodness of God and also use it in humility never use your gift to hold the church at you say if I don't sing who else will sing and then you let me also step back that they may see how important I am that's a very big mistake never hold the church at R because of the gift God has given that's what Lucifer tried to do he tried to take Heaven at amen we must Minister under the guidance of of the Holy Spirit and also under the guidance of the ministry amen the pastor that God has given the local church the gift should never Minister self glory and especially the music gift there is something strange that the music gift does you know you sing is very nice to sing I think I should take quite a number of services on music and if you sing and it doesn't bring joy On th side there is a problem singing itself opens up a well of joy and then you really feel like you entering into some unit some point but if you sing about the joy and you are miserable there is a problem music has something it does that it excites the people amen so the gifts like the gift of music you know it causes a pool of the people when you're singing you can sing the people healed you know it is such a powerful music brother Bram calling of Abraham he said I'm just the channel he's talking about gifts he says I'm just the channel and in the Good Shepherd of the sheep he says God gave me as a gift to the public I belong to the public when God gives you a gift it's your body that God has chosen to use as a channel to bless the people when he places a gift into your life then you become a gift to the public you belong to the public you don't cannot you cannot pull back it's the people people that use that gift amen so remember now after the fall the gift of music was brought down into a form of entertainment Amen in the cities that K's lines built are you together with me you see it LS the purpose of worship that's why all the music that we compose should not be about us the music we compos must be about Christ it must be to worship andr should be a testament of his goodness amen but when the form came among people it's exactly what Lucifer desired he said I'll go to the sides of the nose and I also be like a god amen he wanted worshipers and he got the worshipers the children of men who had fallen are you together with me and the music they s certainly worship what do they sing about they sing about women they sing about money they sing about fights they sing about all those things don't bring joy take away Joy are you together with me yeah we need music which is written by the young people the music that will bring joy to the hearts of The Listener that will begin a Revival to the hearts that hear are you together with me yes sir in Genesis 4 we are now looking at the fall amen we see that in chapter 3 you know there was a fall but the fall became I mean produced some products you see whenever man falls there are certain things that come in life so that you can see that in the man's life there is a fall amen when now mean when Adam fell you know he hid away from God and any man who does not have time for fellow it doesn't matter how much explanation you give that man has fallen in the heart he can explain as much as he wants but you look at the T out of the situations the fall of Adam Adam hides amen now we see also K kills his brother and Kan walks away and he went away from fellow listen Genesis 4:16 and Cain went from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of on the east of Ed and knew his wife and she conceived and be en and bu a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch but this Enoch is not the Enoch that was translated that Eno that was not translated is the son of Cain he begot then l in [Music] ciam amen and one of his wives was the father of all such as hand [Music] notice that he was not a worshiper he was doing all those trumpets and all those orans not toship but to sing the people happy when we write our music we are not trying to sing the people happy we are worshiping God we are bringing them into an atmosphere amen praise God so that God may move their hearts so music for entertainment began in the Fallen cities of that had the depression of the sinful life but this morning we are not doing an entertainment this is a de are you together with me so the people who sing music for entertainment they open flat Gates of Hell amen and brother Bram say most of those entertainers they have two or three that work around their lives two or three of them to keep them stud any music that doesn't praise God it brings depression that's why those guys are on drugs and they on alcohol but holy ghost music brings happiness brings Joy brings deliverance and that's what we want to see today brother Bram says and roll is going to lead the people to the are you together with me yes sir so while K's line thought that they had killed ab and they began their music oh hallelujah hallelujah it came to a time in Genesis 426 and so to him also there was born a son [Applause] and he called his name anos and then began men to call upon the name of the [Applause] Lord hallelujah hallelujah you are not going to take over this world God is going to raise men amen he going to raise sons of that will also call upon the name of are you hear sons of Amen you are that se that will counteract the cycle not use the music as an entertainment but use the music to call upon God in your music and Christ should be the central theme of your music hallelujah hallelujah not how good you are not how good your church is not the much money you have got no sir the purpose lift him higher hallelujah hallelujah and music does that best we should enter into his G with Spiritual music from God and from the heart to bring God down Hallelujah Hallelujah music s from the heart brings God down an embattled heart amen so for example singer comes out here and is singing from the heart is ministering to you as the ministers this brings God down to an embattled Heart To A depressed heart D had that gift he would come down and he would sing from the he would play his instrument and sa a man who hated him would be blessed are you together with me you must sing until a man who hats you will be delivered that he can come and give you a warm embrace and say you are my brother so what are we here for to deliver one another the gift of music God given away young people is powerful it won battles it won the Battle of jeap Amen music is very powerful when they were going in to take the land they just played the trumpets and the walls of Jero fell amen you must Worship in every song that will be sng here today bring down that presence a presence that would bring down where God is they are Chim they are angelsim and it opens the attributes of God hallelujah at work among the people to say that's great worship the Healer I am the Prov I am the of Joy he opens up those attributes and today God is going to open up those enter into his gats withg and into his cour with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name that's what we are here for hallelujah hallelujah and I want tell you friends that when you miss a song service you you don't kind of you know Link in to the Feld of the holy spirit in the service yeah you come after the song service you are not ushered into presence amen you tell your friend we should never miss the song service okay now not everybody should say it let the L comers say praise the lord we should never miss the song service that's the bottom line because it ashers you into the presence enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his cour with praise yes sir music always goes ahead of the world Amen that's the way God works in Amos and verse 11 he says in that day I raise up the Tabernacle of David that is fall and close up the bridge of Z and I raise up his runes and I build it in the days of all the days of all now that's a prophetic verse in the Book of Amos that came after the building of the Tabernacle in the wilderness the the building the Tabernacle of David which had already fallen and already also the one of Solomon but God promised the Tabernacle of David again he says I'll build it as in the days of War so this Tabernacle in Prophecy was related to the Tabernacle of David in Jerusalem and this Tabernacle here did not have you know those courts it was just one building and now all the people entered into presence hallelujah hallelujah in that court of David there is no man who says you belong to the outer Court to the middle in the house I mean in the Tabernacle of David we all enter into presence hallelujah hallelujah and that's what David is saying in Psalms 100 he doesn't understand cour he understands into presence a tabernacle that was open and this Tabernacle was built when Christ returned during the Feast of Pentecost as the Holy Ghost are you together with me that is the Tabernacle that was open to both loaves as it was in the Feast of Pentecost amen there were two Ls the Jews and the Gentiles together on the fif of Pentecost and the Holy Spirit came down hallelujah hallelujah a tabernacle not bu with hands hallelujah hallelujah that's the Tabernacle of David that brings an all encompassing presence are you together with me so Acts chapter 15 and verse 16 this is now he says after this I will return they are quoting the same prophecy now and will build again the Tabernacle of David which is fallen down and I build again the runes thereof the resue of men may seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called say the Lord who does all these things hallelujah hallelujah he says this Tabernacle will be spectacular it not be for the Jews alone it will be the Gentiles too so let me say this good afternoon Tabernacle of David praise the lord we are the Tabernacle of David so in the Tabernacle of David you know when he was building that physical Tabernacle in Jerusalem let me tell you what happened music went ahead of the world to prepare The Souls of did you see why I say you should never miss the song service music opens the pathway opens the channel itens the joy Amen in first Chronicles chapter 15 and 16 the ark was led into the house of God by music amen the music opens the CH of Joy among the people the scripture says break up your fall of ground that you may not s in the thought so this music here he helps us to break the follow ground of depression sent out the sex of the Soul they begin to open so wide that the Lord himself can now speak to your soul so in the Tabernacle of David we all do a real Ser [Music] music don't borrow from kan's Beats to excite the flesh do music that will Dig Down The Souls of men and remove all spirits of evil and disease I want to see people healed in the worship I want see the Holy Ghost come down in that's what we are here for amen music bring him down and takes over every ministering gift in the house that's what music does it takes over I want us to look at the impact of holy music as the dedication of Solomon amen you see music as people say it's not just a matter of singing anything all the people see but the musicians they are extra because they are given a gift and the gift grows I'm not Happ looking at the men in the field and their gift doesn't grow you know you don't spice it up but in the Tabernacle of Moses I mean of Solomon the dedication of it brother the Holy Spirit came and Blended the music you don't just keep playing off key of key and my heart is praising God you are a singer you are a song leader but you always off key pray Lord help my gift to grow are you together with me you wouldn't want me here as your pastor when I come down here and the best thing I preach is godhead every come Jesus Is God hallelujah hallelujah we have seen enough of that out there in the organization every time a pastor comes is doing something strange today and people come to hear the same thing next there something our God is good something walk and go overseas oh you have been healed when all of them go sick go sick back you see I don't want a Ministry like that the ministry must grow the music must grow the music can destroy your service brother music like in the days of Solomon it can take over the ministers let's go to Second chronic 5 verse it came to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one are you together with me musicians are you there the trumpeters and the singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord for his good for his forever house was filled with a CL even the house of the Lord so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord that filled the house of the Lord can you imagine that such a blessed presence I desire to see such a song service that brings him down that it would cause me to step out of the way that I would not Minister but he would Minister are you together with me yeah the ministers could not but today I want such a music s that would make Val out of the way that the Holy Spirit may speak to you amen so music brings down motivation it brings down Joy it brings down seren peace I'll give you this one little example as I try to get out amen so that we may start the worship service now Ahab a son that he had left behind and his name was that began to rule and he ruled for 12 years in Israel and he started at the 18th year of King josaphat when he ruled in Judah so he deled into some of the evils of his father much as he put away the image of B which his father had made but during the time of Ahab I mean M the king of Moab used to send Ahab 100,000 [Music] LS 100,000 but Ahab was dead when he died the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel so the son of Ahab organized Israel into battle against Mo and he as the support of jeos just exactly like his father had asked for the support of jeos to go and redeem amen so in that Confederation the king of Edom went with them but during the charge against Moab they lost campus in the desert of Edom and you know they were lost for seven days without water now you see King cry the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hands of Mo so in Second Kings 3 and verse 11 I think I'll take a series on music and worship because it's very necessary amen he says in verse 11 but this man is speaking about death this man here is saying where is he he wants to see God you know many times when we get into situations that's higher than us you need to start looking for God God wants to reveal himself but men that don't have faith when they get into those kind of situations God has delivered this three kings into the hands of Moab you should always have a postive man in the hardest of time seek for his presence but J say is there not here prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by him and one of the kings of one of the king of Israel servants answered and said here is elishah the son of saf which poured water on the hands of el are you together with me you see whenever you are in a situation God is always moving a solution because he knows he has always advised you to pray whenever you get into a situation the answer is not far away from youen and say the word of the Lord is with him so the king of [Music] isra and the king of went down to meet him and elishah said unto the king of Israel what have I to do with the is now talking to the son of Ahab thee to the prophets of thy father and the prophets of thy mother and the king of Israel said unto him for the Lord has called these three kings together them into the hand of Moab he always insisting on thetive and elishah said as the Lord of host liveth whom I stand were it not for I regard the presence of josaphat king of Judah I would not look toward thee no see thee but [Applause] now bring me hallelujah hallelujah bring me and it came to pass when the M the of the Lord Came Upon hallelujah hallelujah praising God in the hard times praising God in the good time bring from the heart and it moved the prophet into the anointing and he began to prophesy how many are in such a situation now like you entrapped in the desert of Edom like you been going around seven days like you are completely encompassing your troubles praise the lord we have got the M today bring me a m bring somebody that will sing from the heart oh hallelujah hallelujah you see the prophet isah I mean elishah he was all HED up the prophet says he got all hungered up and he says bring me a my and the my begin to play and the Spirit come upon the Propet and then he began to see Vision hallelujah hallelujah in whatever situation you have come thank God this is the day of the Myst Hallelujah Hallelujah I like that I like something you feel in your soul feeling somebody to sing to my heart not to sing to my emotions says I like jubile s amen near I go to the Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross these are the things that gets down in my heart hallelujah hallelujah are you ready to hear the M amen bring me something will change in my circumstance something will change in my life the holy spirit will come down and speak to me bring me a m God bless you are you ready to receive the M yes bring me somebody to sing me Jo praise God as the pastor comes amen

standing by me in the vision and I seen they said the preview of the Bride I seen her go by they come on on this side and went around I heard it coming and the church is coming up from the other side there come the Asian Church oh you talk about filth here come to the European Church oh my and then I had rock and roll coming and it was Miss America the church and she didn't have on any clothes she had papers like new uh like newspapers gray holding in in front in front her dancing by rock and roll Miss America the church I stood there in his presence I thought oh God as a minister if that's the best we could do oh oh you know how you uh you feels then I thought God hide me if I could just get away from here if all that I've done and that we have to produce if that's what and then when them women pass by all doing all kinds of rocks and things and short hair and painted faces and they passed by like that supposed to be virgins of Christ and when she passed by like that I turned my head

there him standing there and me know that me a minister of the church and that's what I had produced for him I said oh God I can't look at it let me die let me fade away and I like that and as soon as it went out every time one of them would come they would go out to a certain place then drop off I would just hear the sound of it as it went away then I heard something like Onward Christian Soldiers

Seals and on a and a and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in the earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and I wept much because no man was able no man was worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there own and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the line of J the line of Judah the root and offspring of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and I beheld and law in the midst of the throne and of the for beasts and in the midest of the elders stood a lamp as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into into all the Earth and he came and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell upon fell before the lamb having every one of them HS and golden vs full of ERS which are the prayers of the Saints and they sng a new a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our good Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth and behold I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and beasts and elders and the number of them was 10,000 * 10,000 and th000 and thousand thousands saying saying with a loud voice Worthy is the lamp that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea

going to minister unto the Lord in two songs time shall be no [Applause] more and the years of Innocence am amen time shall be amen praise the name of the Lord I want to greet you all to greet you all who are here the Saints of the Lord and I'm very glad to be part of the youth because I also desire to get back to that time of Innocence praise the name of the Lord I composed that song during that time of uh uh covid uh we had enough time so I had enough time to study my sermons and sometimes the spirit would come and I feel like conforting myself with singing you see I like singing more than preaching I would say praise the name of the Lord and uh the inspiration actually I got it from my pastor we were sharing during that time and then there is a a quote or something the scripture I put on our forum and then Pastor had to put there some words he didn't know the words he put there would get a song Praise the name of the Lord so they were his words the relics and then me I got a song out of them he's he's wondering but he doesn't remember praise the name of the Lord so uh the inspiration you said which one I'm beginning with times shall be no more praise the name of the Lord uh time shall be no more the inspiration uh I got from uh the Ephesians chapter 5 verse 15 16 and 19 it says see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will what the will of the Lord is and then verse 19 speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord amen and then I got a quote from the message Shalom praise the name of the Lord no excuse me I'm mixing them up here because I have two songs amen uh the quote is from uh Divine Healing I I get it here from her amen because I had sent on her phone Divine Healing I says and Jesus and Jesus the very last Commission he gave he give was go into all the world and preach this gospel to Every Creature I'll read it from there can you see then friend why can't you stay home there is just something in me tearing me to pieces I realize something is got to be done brother sister we uh I can't do it myself and I don't know what I see these missionary societies and how they fold up and fail and everything else over there because they got uh because they got the wrong thing to go with over there with theology well them people laughes at you can't go over there with theology they don't even believe that stuff you've got to show them that God is God that's right praise the name of the Lord so uh we need to go and preach the gospel paragraph 59 give it to me praise the name of the Lord it says and what can I what can a person do I don't I don't know but I know one of these days it will all be over and the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and say time shall be no more praise the name of the Lord and that's the inspiration from the song and now I need these girls to help me I I have to sit there and get that guitar here and help them behind maybe somebody will hold for me the microphone you going to give me t [Music] just a minute just a [Music]

the years of Innocence those are the words I told you I got from Pastor amen and I got a lyric out of it a song out of it the inspiration is from Matthew chapter 18 verse 2 and 3 where Jesus was brought the child and says and Jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily I say unto you except you be converted and become as a child as a little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven and uh we have Isaiah 11 chapter 11 verse 2 3 up to verse 2 up to 6 we shall read and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord and righteousness shall be the GLE of his loins and faithfulness the G of his Reigns The Wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the cow and the Young Lion and the firstling together and a little child shall lead them the inspiration from the message of the hour I get it from the message Shalom preached 1964 in January 12th and he says there will be a millennium the old will be young there forever amen sickness will fade away and death will be no more they shall build houses they will inhabit them they will plant Vineyards and eat the fruit thereof they will not plant and another inhabit his son take it his son will be living by him he will not plant and another itss die off or somebody else take it but he'll live there amen the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the Bullock and a child shall lead them around there will be there will be innocence there will be there will be nothing good Hur we will be changed from what we are now to that glorious image of the Son of God which is manful which is Immortal years can never touch him age can never do anything to him he is the immortal Son of God so so we know that we were we are at the end time we are living at the junction all these things thoroughly identified so will it be identified again we shall play the same [Music] i y for the Y as a king when I had no pressure for anything th V th when I never realize with I was for I am for the

Holy Ghost and then also Titus 37 Titus 3 verse 7 that being justified by his grace we should be made hairs according to the hope of eternal life and lastly Hebrews 10:14 for by one offering he hath

the [Music] Lord God bless you we are so happy to be here we are blessed honored and humbled to be here um I'm just so happy to see my brother Joseph the who has just left the stage I happen to be one of the few blessed people that have had that song five years ago and actually we did a do it of it so I'm really blessed by that song um uh we have two songs but before that there's a song that uh got put in my spirit um towards the end of last year I think from uh 28th to 31st and it has been playing in my heart I think it's because it speak to my situation that I was in during that time and it's one of the songs from here and uh I used to call it uh I'm not a stranger to the valley but when they upload the video they called it Valley so but it's okay so if you would allow I'd like to sing just one verse and uh just a chorus I'm going to uh I'm not going to sing the whole verse just I'll begin from the middle he say I'll sing a capella so musicians don't worry I've come toiz for to my life he has to bring me out and remake me again I say to you my friend be sure that everything will for your good I'm our stranger to the valley I V this Ro before I on and i' fallen on my face but I to right up again it's not my strength [Music] a strength I have in [Music] Christ oh I pray for you my friend and our land helping her we'll make it all together bless you so the first song I will sing is called theoo is a song that I Got U from uh a message which I forgot I forgot where I put my notes but uh it was preached by Pastor charie Emmanuel and uh I was talking about a race that Christians are in a race but you have three techniques that you have to use in that race the first one is patience the next is endurance and then the last one is abandonment so in this song We're exploring those Concepts and I think that they encompassed in the chorus the first inspiration is from uh Hebrews 12 verse 1 it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which that easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us so one of the techniques is patience you have to run with patience then another one is from uh First Corinthians 9:24 know ye not that ye which run in a race run all but one Rees the price so run that he may obtain and every man that strives for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we are uncorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as the one that Beth the air but I keep my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast Away now that that uh verse um it inspired second chorus where we about so you have to bring your body under subjection in that place then the last inspiration is from uh the message called the years of our pilgrimage there a message which was preached by our pastor here Pastor during our convention last year and I caught I don't have a recording but I caught it my head he said keep on holding firm every victory that you get maturity doesn't come in a in one day it's a journey and that's why I picked the inspiration for the last verse where I talk about uh as running the little victories so uh when you can't be uh 100% but you have to keep on holding every little victory that you get there's also I think I I skip this scripture but it's still in relation to the that verse and I think P also talked about it he said that hold fast that which thou Hast that no man may take thy Crown from Revelation chapter 3 verse 11 then he also said that U from Peter second Peter verse one uh chapter 1 verse 5-7 add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kind kindness and to brotherly kindness charity now you see that's a state of a perfect man you you can't be perfect one day you have to keep on adding those are the small victories we are singing about and uh uh when I was reading this scripture I remember the concept which Pastor here pastor always talks about he always talks about an overlap and an overlap is uh is basically uh a concept where there is an intersection or a sharing of characteristics and sometimes principles so from the what that this song There's an overlap in this song with the F the song that I first suang here called we need love so when I read that on top of all that that we listed in second Peter you have to add charity which is the cstone on a perfect man I remember that song we need love so yeah the concept is a God bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] name [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] for for [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] little Victory when you [Music] fallen calling he will understand [Music] little Victory when you fall brother up the broken [Music] P the of he will understand and stay well [Music] Victory when you fall [Music] the the thek of the high call will he will understand and [Applause] well the name [Music] [Music] [Music] for for [Music] [Music] the next song is called Reckless Faith uh the inspiration the first inspiration is from Joshua 1 to 5 chapter 1 verse to 5 um there shall shall not any man be able to stand before thee older days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee and I have a quote from uh the message called as I was with Moses I'll will be with thee uh preached by Brother Branham in Jefferson ofil Indiana USA uh paragraphs 49 to 50 paragraphs 49 says now Joshua in all this knowing that the command was great but having the Assurance he could be Fearless he could be as we would call it Reckless as long as he was pointed the right way he might break up against a hill that would not KN him backwards but he was carried the right way so can the Church of the Living God be Reckless and Fe and fearless in faith if we are appointed the right way for he said as I was with Moses I will be with you I will not fail you nor forsake you he never forsaken Moses he will not fail Joshua he will not fail us he will be with us now you may be wondering what does reckless mean uh Reckless I Des prob it as just an impulsive actions when your actions are impulsive you can be termed as Reckless or maybe to simplify it in general is acting without thinking or considering the consequences so way your faith should be like that you shouldn't have to see what is around you to believe for something believe for it anyway God bless you why should you cry when you can speak whatever you bu the same shall be bur in heaven why should you cry when you can [Music] speak whatever

immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good Comfort thy Fai have made thee whole go in peace Luke 735 37-38 and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] God bless you God bless youall bless you so much the next song was written by sister Faith and it's called hand the inspiration comes from the message Mary's belief which was preached 1959 April on9 uh it goes like this and you know it's usually when you're thinking about God and keeping our minds on God that God comes close to us I think that's one of the greatest Troubles of the people of this day we have too many other things on our minds even when we come to the healing service we seem to think well I did not get a prayer card tonight or perhaps I will not be prayed for we will never be able to accomplish much as long as we keep those kind of thoughts this angelous Temple is thirsting for the outbreak of the Holy Spirit not only that but the whole United States speaking of the Christian R is waiting for Revival in our time but we are waiting for something to happen and I believe that God has let it happen and we are just so pushing it somewhere else until it will pass over us and our time of Grace will be gone let's be positive in our thinking let's believe that this night now the Revival will break in Angeles Temple tonight let's believe that this is the night that God will do the exceedingly abundantly above all that we could do or think he will do it tonight don't take no further the answer it's when you think those things you create an atmosphere around you and as she was thinking on this that's Mary and as she was thinking on this she raised up her eyes and she thought that she saw a light Flicker and a little virgin perhaps rubbed her lovely angel looking eyes and she looked around and well maybe it was the Sun that kindly reflected off or something and she goes on and turns the corner starting up towards the public well she drops her little head again and pulls her little way well around her shoulders and she went on about her way thinking of what did Isaiah 96 mean when God put something upon a person's heart he's ready to do something that's the reason that he's ready to give the angelous temple an outbreak of the spirit because it's on your heart and as she thought on these things after a while she rised up head again she felt a little strange feeling I just love to feel the presence of the Holy Spirit it just gives that Blessed Assurance you don't always have to see it it's there anyhow and as she moved along she raised her head again and there stood this great light before her perhaps the Temple of fire that led the children of Israel come walking from the light came forth an Archangel Gabriel and he said Hil Mary means to stop blessed art thou among the women hard telling the other women went to the well that morning perhaps thinking about washing as they had to do and some task or some Society in the church they had to take care of but Mary was thinking on the scriptures was not in clopas and his friend on the first Easter morning as they were thinking on the scriptures when Jesus appeared to them and as she saw this great Angel it startled the little virgin she stopped and she come close to her and he come close to her and saluted her and he gave her a message that was a hard message for the child to believe for she wasn't nothing but a girl and he gave her something to believe and was more outstanding and had to believe than anything he would ever give to anyone six months ago before that he would met Zacharia the priest at the temple and he was at the Ed an edged man and had read the scriptures and had Tau the scriptures and because that he was old and his wife was baren the angel same Angel told him after the days of ministration at the altar waving the incense over the people's prayers that when he went home his wife would conceive and bear a child and that preacher questioned the angel how can it be I'm old and my wife is old he had plenty of examples in the Bible there had been Hana at the temple that had Samuel the prophet after she was old and there had been Sarah who brought forth Isaac after she was nearly 100 years old and here this little had to believe something that had never happened a woman having a baby without knowing any man she said how shall these things be my Lord Lord he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee and that thing that will be born from you will be called The Son of God watch her she didn't question that she said behold the handmade of the Lord be itto me according to Thy word and if we just do that that's the only thing that's what God loves that's the only way to get right with God is take him at his word that's the only way that there is the to please God to take his word don't trust your knowledge you reason how can it be done it cannot be done when you reason you lose the victory we must cast down reasoning and believe what God has said to be the truth Mary took him at his word and he changed the whole course of natural life for her he will change the course of your life tonight if you will take him at his word if you are a sinner he will straighten that crooked life of yours out if you are Veil and immoral he will make you as pure as a Le if you'll just take him at his word that very cence of sin that makes you look at immoral things or use the name of the Lord in vain have temp enough to fight or boo so he will change that course of life for you and make you a new creature in his son Christ Jesus by just taking him at his word if you have cancer tonight he will change that for you and give you health if you have tuberculosis or sickness all kind of doctors cannot help he will change that for you if you'll take him at his word and this is his word I am the Lord thy God who heals all thy diseas oh how glorious and marvelous is our Lord God bless [Applause] you God

Salma they were just around and they share everything they get they were two and three at the time and so you know Sarah gets the B of paraffin drinks it and then gives to her sister and now they started falling back lack of oxygen and they were chocking it was such a shock when my wife in the kitchen screamed and said hurry we came and they were coughing they were completely out of oxygen supply there was such a panic we put them in the car I started drive hoting so bad that everybody has to get out of the way and we get to hospital at that particular time there was such a jam on the

is she place my hand so I placed the hand we were praying as we're going forth and by the time we got to the hospital it was such an emergence the quanti that was ingested was big and we really didn't know how and why but by Grace we reached there they put them on oxygen to excel that you know paraffin and they were telling us the worst mistake we did was to force milk in Ron and she was so bad L because we had the idea Mir would expel it and then for S she was such a tough girl that she refused the milk in that kind of time she was a fighter she couldn't take it and then when we took them to hospital you know Rema was in such a bad situation all the you know Exel was paraffin the water urine was paraffin the back was paraffin and it was so bad they were on oxyen for three days the Lord
