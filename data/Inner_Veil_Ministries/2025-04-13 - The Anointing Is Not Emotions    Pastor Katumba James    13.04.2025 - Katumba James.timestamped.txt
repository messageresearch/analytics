[10:50] [Music]
[10:53] I amen. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[10:57] us have a word of prayer. Father, we
[11:00] thank you for this
[11:01] afternoon, for the grace you've given us
[11:04] to come back
[11:05] again. We pray that Lord, you may speak
[11:08] to
[11:09] us according to your divine purpose and
[11:13] will given us upon this
[11:16] service and Lord may bless our hearts
[11:20] Lord. We also fill our hearts with your
[11:22] holy
[11:24] spirit as we are expecting from you
[11:27] Lord. We love you Lord and bless
[11:30] you. In the name of the Lord Jesus we
[11:33] grant us
[11:34] this. Amen. Amen. Let us turn to 1
[11:38] Samuel chapter
[11:42] 16 and then verse 11 verse
[11:48] 13. Amen. Amen.
[11:52] The Bible
[11:53] says, "And Samuel said unto
[11:57] Jesse, here are all thy children." And
[12:00] he said, "There remainth yet the
[12:02] youngest, and behold, he keepeth the
[12:05] sheep." And Samuel said unto Jesse,
[12:08] "Send and fetch him, for we will not sit
[12:11] down till he come hither.
[12:33] And he sent and brought him in. Now he
[12:36] was rudy and wither of a beautiful
[12:38] countenance and good to look to. And the
[12:41] Lord said, "Arise and anoint him, for
[12:44] this is he.
[13:09] Then Samuel took the horn of oil and
[13:12] anointed him in the midst of his
[13:14] brethren. And the spirit of the Lord
[13:16] came upon David from that day forward.
[13:19] So Samuel rose up and went to Rama.
[13:43] May God sing of his
[13:45] word. Praise and you may be
[13:48] seated. So I want to talk on anointing.
[13:51] The anointing is not
[13:56] emotions. Praise the name of the Lord.
[13:59] You know we are used to that where
[14:02] people think that when one is
[14:08] anointed or what we
[14:11] think that when somebody is
[14:14] anointed they are so much emotional.
[14:19] No wonder the trend of emotions as
[14:23] evidence of the Holy
[14:30] Spirit takes many people's
[14:33] mind and you know some people when they
[14:36] are seeking for the baptism of the Holy
[14:39] Spirit they are looking for how they are
[14:41] going to feel or some kind of
[14:46] emotion and then you people can start
[14:48] explaining how they
[14:51] felt or what they did and then they give
[14:55] you that that that is the evidence that
[14:57] I've got the baptism of the Holy
[15:02] Spirit and somebody wants you to ask you
[15:05] what's the
[15:08] time what was
[15:11] this and if you can't tell him
[15:14] that said you have
[15:17] never but anoint
[15:19] ointing is not
[15:22] emotions. Now in the message why are
[15:24] people so tossed
[15:27] about? Brother Brham says some people
[15:31] get the wrong
[15:34] impression of what the anointing
[15:38] is. Did you ever think of
[15:41] that? When was the greatest anointing
[15:44] ever give to anyone?
[15:54] And what did they do when they had that
[15:59] anointing? The greatest
[16:01] anointing that was ever give to
[16:06] anyone was Jesus
[16:08] Christ. We've we have the spirit by
[16:14] measure, but he had it without
[16:19] measure. And one day he entered into the
[16:24] temple and picked up the
[16:27] scroll and read and said, "The spirit of
[16:32] God is upon
[16:35] me, for he has anointed me.
[16:40] to preach the acceptable
[16:43] young to bind up the broken
[16:47] hearts, to heal the
[16:49] sick, give sight to the
[16:53] blind. Now, he's talking about
[16:56] Christ. Nobody had anointing like Christ
[16:59] had the
[17:01] anointing because our Lord Jesus
[17:04] Christ. He had the anointing of the Holy
[17:07] Spirit.
[17:09] without
[17:10] measure because he was the fullness of
[17:13] the godhead
[17:16] body and he was the Christ, the anointed
[17:20] one, the
[17:23] Messiah. So he was
[17:25] anointed above anyone
[17:29] else. And so now one day Jesus went into
[17:32] the
[17:35] synagogue in the book of Luke
[17:39] 4. And the Bible says, they gave him the
[17:43] book of
[17:45] Isaiah. And when he got the portion
[17:48] which was in Isaiah chapter
[17:52] 61 verse one and verse
[17:55] two then he
[17:57] says Luke
[18:01] 4:18 the spirit of the Lord is upon
[18:07] me. He has anointed me to preach the
[18:10] gospel to the poor.
[18:16] He has sent me to heal the
[18:21] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[18:23] the
[18:28] captives. And recovering of sight to the
[18:31] blind, and to set at liberty them that
[18:34] are bruised.
[18:42] to preach the accept of the
[18:47] Lord. And he closed the book. And he
[18:50] gave it to the
[18:52] minister and sat down. And the eyes of
[18:55] them were all in the synagogue were
[18:58] fastened on
[19:02] him. 19.
[19:08] He began to
[19:10] say, "This day is this scripture
[19:13] fulfilled in your
[19:17] eyes." All that bear him
[19:20] witness that the gracious ones which
[19:22] proceeded out of his mouth and said, "Is
[19:25] not this Joseph's son?
[19:37] He says, "The spirit of the Lord is upon
[19:40] me." The whole
[19:43] anointing. So he goes in the
[19:46] synagogue. He gets the scroll of
[19:49] Isaiah. And then he reads it before
[19:53] them and say this day this scripture is
[19:57] fulfilled. And after reading it, he goes
[20:00] and sits
[20:02] down. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[20:05] didn't start running
[20:07] around. No, just sat down. And then
[20:12] brother Brennham says in that message,
[20:14] why are people so tossed
[20:17] about? And now we would
[20:20] think if such anointing was on
[20:24] him that had been prophesied 800
[20:30] years before that it would
[20:33] come. And here he was with that type of
[20:39] anointing the full
[20:41] blessing and anointing of the Lord upon
[20:46] him. We would run all over the
[20:51] building, scream and
[20:54] horror, but the Bible said he laid down
[20:57] the
[20:58] scroll and sat down and precious
[21:03] words proceeded out of his mouth. Then
[21:07] brother Brham says that's what he done
[21:10] under the
[21:13] anointing. So then our mind
[21:17] should totally go out of
[21:21] emotions for approve of
[21:24] anointing. Praise the name of the Lord.
[21:27] You know some people get worked
[21:30] up and then you know they would want to
[21:32] just do this and then say I think that's
[21:40] anointing. Praise the name
[21:42] of you know sometimes we get mistaken.
[21:48] This was a this was this is an
[21:52] illustration. We had a sister some time
[21:56] ago. Praise the name of our Lord and
[21:58] then we were in
[22:00] worship. It's not bad to worship
[22:05] freely. It's not bad to raise your hand
[22:07] when you are
[22:09] worshiping or crying when you are woring
[22:12] or shouting when you are washing.
[22:15] Nothing wrong with
[22:16] that. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[22:19] it's nothing wrong with running
[22:21] around if you do it in
[22:24] order. Nothing wrong with that. But now
[22:27] the sister was busy praying
[22:30] and you know like somebody who really
[22:33] who has the anointing or so
[22:37] on fully given
[22:42] in then the following day
[22:49] divorced. Now you then you start
[22:52] wondering and the divorce is not that
[22:54] I'm leaving but I'm getting married to
[22:56] another
[22:59] person and you start wondering was that
[23:03] person
[23:08] genuine? Praise the name of our so the
[23:11] anointing brother Brham talks about
[23:14] Because the anointing is not
[23:17] emotions. The anointing is supreme power
[23:21] in
[23:25] control. In other words, if you are
[23:29] anointed, you know what you are
[23:33] doing. When you are
[23:35] anointed, praise the name of our Lord.
[23:38] God takes charge over your life.
[23:41] And when God is taking charge over your
[23:44] life, you'll do that which is
[23:47] right. And then he says like knowing
[23:51] exactly what and
[23:56] how and that is what is
[23:58] here. And he was talking this when a
[24:02] sister had just come out of a
[24:06] wheelchair and then she was moving
[24:08] around.
[24:09] Then he said this is the
[24:12] anointing. So it was not about running
[24:14] about doing this and
[24:17] this. And you know there are some people
[24:19] who seek the baptism of the Holy
[24:23] Spirit or they
[24:25] look and then they are looking for some
[24:29] emotion, some
[24:32] sensation. Praise the name of our Lord.
[24:35] Now in the
[24:37] message Christ is the mystery of God
[24:40] revealed.
[24:42] Praise the name of our Lord.
[24:45] Let me read it here.
[24:50] It
[24:52] says just beg your pardon here.
[25:01] That is some of the mysteries that this
[25:03] angel is supposed to wind
[25:07] up. All the
[25:09] mystery, all the mysteries of
[25:12] God and the other. May I say this with
[25:17] reverence not referring to
[25:20] myself but referring to the angel of
[25:24] God. The serpent is
[25:27] seed that has been hidden
[25:31] mystery all through the
[25:34] years. The grace straightened
[25:39] out, not this
[25:44] grace, but real true
[25:48] grace. No such a thing as eternal.
[25:56] You will burn for millions of
[26:00] years. But anything that was
[26:04] eternal had never a beginning or
[26:08] end. And hell was
[26:11] created, all these
[26:14] mysteries, the mystery of the baptism of
[26:16] the Holy
[26:19] Ghost without sensation.
[26:22] but the person of
[26:25] Christ performing in
[26:27] you the same works that he
[26:31] did. Now, brother Brandham is saying
[26:35] part of the mysteries to be
[26:37] revealed by the seventh
[26:40] angel under under the opening of the
[26:43] seven
[26:44] seals was the mystery of the baptism of
[26:48] the Holy
[26:50] Spirit without any
[26:54] sensation without any
[26:57] emotion. Praise the name of our Lord.
[27:00] That's now part of the third book.
[27:04] Praise the name of our Lord. Where the
[27:06] Holy
[27:07] Spirit comes down to your
[27:10] soul and your soul has one
[27:16] sense. Praise the name of our Lord.
[27:19] Faith or doubt. And the Holy Ghost to
[27:23] come down to the
[27:25] soul. One must be predestinated to
[27:29] eternal life.
[27:33] Praise the name of our Lord. He has to
[27:35] be
[27:37] predestinated to eternal life. Now in
[27:40] the message
[27:42] leadership, brother Brandham says, he
[27:45] says many many of you
[27:49] think I got the baptism of the Holy
[27:52] Ghost, I'm going to
[27:54] heaven. That don't mean one
[27:58] thing that you are going to heaven.
[28:01] No sir, you have the baptism of the Holy
[28:05] Ghost every hour in your
[28:09] life and still be lost and go to hell.
[28:14] The Bible says
[28:16] so. Some of these are hard words to
[28:19] say, but you need to get the
[28:23] understanding. The mind of brother
[28:25] Brham.
[28:27] The mind of brother Brham
[28:29] when he was bringing this thing. Now in
[28:32] the message you know he preached this
[28:34] about four series of
[28:39] messages. In December of
[28:44] 1965 praise the name of our Lord. In
[28:46] December of
[28:49] 1965, actually there were some of the
[28:51] last sermons brother Brandham
[28:56] preached. Praise the name of our Lord.
[28:59] So on 4th of December
[29:04] 1965 he preached the message
[29:07] Rapture. It was in a place called
[29:10] Yuma. He talked about this. Then the
[29:14] following day, 5th of December,
[29:18] he preached in another place called
[29:22] Royalta and he preached on the message
[29:24] things that are to
[29:27] be. And then the following
[29:30] day, 6th of
[29:32] December, he preached a message, modern
[29:35] events are made clear by
[29:40] prophecy in San Bido.
[29:43] He talked about
[29:45] December and then the following day 7th
[29:49] of
[29:50] December
[29:53] 1965 he in a place called
[29:57] Vina he preached the message
[30:00] leadership the quote I've read but now
[30:04] let us go in the message modern events
[30:06] are made clear by
[30:10] prophecy in paragraph
[30:12] 100 he says there are many people just
[30:16] can't believe
[30:18] it even spiritfilled people I am going
[30:22] to give you
[30:24] one that will choke
[30:29] you the baptism of the Holy
[30:32] Ghost don't mean you are going
[30:36] in not at
[30:39] all not on
[30:41] that don't have anything to do with your
[30:45] soul. Now you're seeing how he's
[30:47] completely placing
[30:50] it. He says if it doesn't go to your
[30:56] soul, then you are lost. Much as you
[31:00] say, I was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[31:03] But if the
[31:04] soul never got that spirit of
[31:08] God says you're not going
[31:11] anywhere. So he says see here is the
[31:15] inside soul that has to come from
[31:21] God. But then on the
[31:23] outside you have five
[31:26] senses. You contact your earthly home.
[31:31] The inside you have the spirit and in
[31:34] there you have five
[31:37] outlets
[31:38] conscious and love and so forth. Five
[31:43] outlets to that
[31:44] spirit. Remember that in that
[31:48] spirit you can be baptized with the
[31:50] genuine spirit of
[31:54] God and be lost.
[31:58] It is the
[32:00] soul that lives and was a dain of God.
[32:05] He makes it clear
[32:06] here in the soul there is no
[32:13] emotion. But on the human
[32:16] spirit you can become
[32:19] emotional. You can
[32:21] prophesy because the spirit has come
[32:23] down to your human
[32:25] spirit. You can see visions.
[32:29] You can speak in tongues. You can do all
[32:31] those kind of things. But then he says
[32:35] if you receive the Holy Ghost and just
[32:37] goes to the
[32:41] spirit, you can have all those emotions
[32:43] and
[32:45] sensations and you are
[32:47] lost. Praise the name of our Lord. But
[32:50] we need the baptism of the Holy
[32:52] Spirit to go to the
[32:55] soul. And that's where the life, eternal
[32:57] life
[32:58] is. So when he says the mystery of the
[33:01] baptism of the Holy
[33:04] Spirit without
[33:07] sensation is meaning the baptism of the
[33:09] Holy
[33:11] Spirit, going to the
[33:14] soul. Praise the name of our Lord. Going
[33:17] to the soul.
[33:19] You can have the spirit come and and
[33:21] then make you do many different
[33:25] things. How about inside the
[33:27] soul? And that's now where the third
[33:30] pull
[33:31] is. The revealing of the word. The first
[33:35] pull was on the
[33:38] body. He would touch somebody's
[33:41] hand. He uses his left hand, touch
[33:44] somebody's right hand. And then he would
[33:47] have vibration.
[33:50] He tells him what sickness he
[33:52] has. He prays for him. The vibration
[33:55] stops in the hand. Then he declares him
[33:58] that you are
[33:59] healed. First
[34:01] pull. And that attracts so many
[34:05] people. Then the second pull was the
[34:09] discernment of
[34:12] spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[34:15] then the third pull
[34:18] is the revealing of the word and that's
[34:21] where the elect is
[34:23] caught and that's what we get a hold
[34:27] of. Praise the name of our lord. So now
[34:30] we see also in this
[34:33] message let me get this message here.
[34:37] Praise the name of our
[34:40] Lord in the message and knows it
[34:44] not. He says and now the reason that
[34:47] people
[34:48] today now don't forget this
[34:51] now and you'll see what the
[34:55] holy you'll
[34:57] see what the initial evidence of the
[35:00] Holy Ghost
[35:02] is. Now people can live in this
[35:07] spirit. That's the human spirit. And
[35:10] they dance in the
[35:12] spirit. They shout in the
[35:15] spirit. They go to church in the
[35:19] spirit. And they can absolutely have the
[35:22] spir the real spirit of
[35:26] God anointed on that human
[35:30] spirit but still be
[35:34] lost and just as devil
[35:38] possessed as they can
[35:40] be with that
[35:43] spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[35:46] you see this is where the falsely
[35:48] anointed ones comes
[35:55] in. They anointed by the Holy
[35:58] Spirit, but they are
[36:01] wrong. Matthew
[36:05] 24:4, they can do those
[36:08] miracles, wonders,
[36:11] signs, but they don't obey the word.
[36:14] the same thing. Look what Balam with the
[36:18] spirit of God and trying to do stumbling
[36:21] for
[36:24] Israel. Look
[36:27] what the spirit came upon him and he
[36:32] prophesied but he condemned Christ to
[36:34] death.
[36:38] So you see we need to be very
[36:42] careful. And you see many
[36:45] people they think that they can get the
[36:47] genuine baptism of the Holy
[36:52] Spirit without obedience to the
[36:54] word. They demean the
[36:58] word. But if the spirit speaking the
[37:02] word and then you want the spirit and
[37:06] you're rejecting what the spirit is
[37:07] telling
[37:09] you, you'll go to the side of the
[37:11] rebellious
[37:13] also because the Bible says even the
[37:17] rebellious he gives them
[37:20] gifts. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[37:23] us go to the book of
[37:24] Psalms. Just want to get that scripture
[37:26] here.
[37:29] It says even the
[37:32] rebellious praise the name of our
[37:39] Lord. The book of
[37:42] Psalms. Let me get that scripture right
[37:45] now.
[37:56] Psalms chapter 68.
[38:11] And then verse
[38:13] 18 he says, "Though hast ascended on
[38:17] I and th has led captive
[38:21] captivity, you thou hast received gifts
[38:24] for
[38:25] men." Yeah. For the rebellious
[38:29] also that the Lord God might dwell among
[38:35] them. Praise the name of Lord.
[38:39] So we need to see how to get the genuine
[38:43] baptism of the Holy
[38:47] Spirit. Receive the word, obey the word
[38:51] because the word goes to the
[38:53] soul. And when the word is in the
[38:56] soul, then the Holy Spirit will follow
[39:00] the word where it is
[39:02] stationed in the soul. Praise the name
[39:06] of our Lord. And that's the baptism that
[39:08] we want in our
[39:09] lives. If really God has filled me with
[39:12] the Holy
[39:13] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is in my
[39:18] soul, I will have no hatred for another
[39:21] person, I will not
[39:24] have. Praise the name of the Lord. But
[39:26] then you get somebody saying I have the
[39:28] spirit of
[39:29] God. But when it comes to
[39:33] hatred, start
[39:35] wondering how do you have the spirit and
[39:38] you can afford to
[39:41] hate. How? That means you just got the
[39:45] spirit on your human
[39:48] spirit and then you will
[39:50] prophesy or you became so emotional or
[39:54] you ran around but the life you
[39:57] live doesn't match with your
[40:00] testimony. Praise the name of our Lord.
[40:03] Now that should not be our
[40:06] desire. Our desire should be the life of
[40:09] Jesus
[40:10] Christ himself in us.
[40:14] Praise the name of the Lord. And then we
[40:16] shouldn't
[40:19] pretend because one would be wasting
[40:21] their
[40:22] time. Why would I pretend that I'm I'm
[40:26] saved? Why should I pretend that I'm a
[40:29] message
[40:30] believer? Without the life of
[40:33] Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[40:35] he continue send a message and knows it
[40:39] not because
[40:42] watch that's the reason you couldn't
[40:44] tell that
[40:47] woman she was wearing
[40:49] shorts was wrong. You don't tell her
[40:53] bobbing her hair was
[40:55] wrong. Well that's that's what your hair
[40:58] got to do with
[41:03] it. Well, it did to Samson.
[41:10] So he said they they said they have
[41:12] their
[41:14] spirit but then they deny the word. They
[41:17] reject the
[41:19] word. Praise the name of our Lord. The
[41:22] Bible says they have a form of
[41:26] godliness, you know, but they deny the
[41:30] power,
[41:32] the power of
[41:34] transformation which will change their
[41:38] lives. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[41:40] we see that
[41:42] anointing is not
[41:45] emotions. When David was
[41:48] anointed, he didn't start running
[41:50] around.
[41:52] No, when Christ was standing in the
[41:55] synagogue as calm as he could be but
[41:59] with all the anointing on
[42:01] him in Acts chapter
[42:04] 9. Praise the name of our Lord. Acts
[42:07] chapter
[42:10] 9 and then we read from
[42:17] verse verse 17.
[42:21] And anas went his
[42:26] way and entered into the
[42:29] house and putting his hands on him
[42:33] said, "Brother
[42:35] Saul, the Lord, even
[42:39] Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way
[42:41] as you
[42:44] came has sent
[42:47] me that you might receive your
[42:51] [Music]
[42:55] sight and be filled with the Holy
[42:58] Ghost. Now, Ananas was sent by
[43:02] God to lay his hands on
[43:06] Saul so that Saul's eyes could be
[43:10] opened and soul should be filled with
[43:12] the
[43:13] Holy. Now in verse 18, and immediately
[43:17] dam fell from his eyes as it had been
[43:34] scales, and he received sight forth
[43:37] with, and arose, and was baptized.
[43:43] And when he had received meat,
[43:45] he was strengthened.
[43:48] Then soul was certain days with the
[43:51] disciples which were at
[43:56] Damascus. Praise the name of our Lord.
[43:59] You know this scripture here the Bible
[44:02] says anas laid his hands
[44:06] on. And when he laid his hands on
[44:09] Saul, the eyes scales came from the
[44:15] eyes. And Saul was able to
[44:18] see. But he anas was
[44:22] saying to lay hands. So that two things
[44:26] are
[44:27] fulfilled. The eyes are
[44:30] open and soul is filled with the Holy
[44:32] Ghost. So the question is, was soul
[44:35] filled with the Holy Ghost?
[44:38] There's no emotion
[44:40] here.
[44:42] Nothing. Praise the name of our Lord.
[44:45] There was no emotion at
[44:47] all. There was no sensation at
[44:51] all when Saul was filled with the Holy
[44:54] Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[44:57] know, brother
[44:59] Brham, they spoke these things by
[45:04] inspiration. Praise the name of our
[45:06] Lord. and he took us back to the Bible.
[45:10] Praise the name of our Lord. And even
[45:12] when you see the baptism of the Holy
[45:13] Ghost in the book of
[45:16] Acts, you'll find that on the day of
[45:20] Pentecost, praise the name of our Lord,
[45:23] when the Holy Spirit came
[45:25] down as a sound of mighty
[45:29] wind and then it filled the house where
[45:31] they
[45:32] were. And then the Bible says, you know,
[45:36] there appeared tanks of
[45:39] fire. You know, a tongue of fire. It's
[45:42] just like when you light a
[45:47] candlestick over and then under when you
[45:50] see that that kind of fire
[45:54] turning the tongue of
[45:57] fire it was a fire that like a form of
[46:01] fire appearing on their
[46:04] head and the Bible says a
[46:07] tongue. In other words, the Holy
[46:11] Spirit divided
[46:14] himself and then they were getting a
[46:16] portion of the Holy
[46:19] Spirit on each of them. And now when the
[46:23] the spirit settled on
[46:25] them, the Bible says their tongues were
[46:31] quickened and then they started speaking
[46:34] with other
[46:36] tongues. On the day of Pentecost,
[46:40] the
[46:41] ears they had that sound in the room.
[46:46] The body felt like goose
[46:53] pimples. The eyes they saw tongs of fire
[46:57] on each other's
[47:00] head. Then the body, their tongues were
[47:03] quickened.
[47:06] So you see that on the day of
[47:08] Pentecost literally every part had
[47:12] emotion. There was a lot of
[47:16] sensation. Praise the name of our Lord.
[47:18] The eyes saw the body fell. The tongue
[47:21] was
[47:23] picking. But now when you see what
[47:26] happened on the day of
[47:28] Pentecost, the emotions which on day of
[47:31] Pentecost are not necessarily the same
[47:36] everywhere. When you follow the baptism
[47:38] of the Holy Ghost in the book of
[47:41] Acts, you not see another place where
[47:43] there are tongues of fire on their
[47:45] [Music]
[47:47] head. Do you mean they never got
[47:49] baptized with the Holy
[47:51] Ghost? In some other places, you don't
[47:54] hear that there was sound of a mighty
[47:57] wind coming. Do you mean they never
[47:59] received the Holy
[48:01] Ghost? In some places, they never
[48:05] prophesy. Do you mean they never
[48:07] received the baptism of the Holy
[48:09] Ghost? Then in some places there was no
[48:12] emotion.
[48:14] Do you mean they never got the B of the
[48:15] Holy
[48:17] Ghost? Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[48:20] let us go back to that
[48:25] message. He says, "The mystery of the
[48:27] baptism of the Holy
[48:29] Ghost without
[48:32] sensation." But the proof that one has
[48:35] the Holy
[48:37] Ghost is the presence of the person of
[48:40] Christ in their life.
[48:43] So the question is if I want to prove
[48:46] whether I have the spirit of
[48:48] God or I don't have the spirit of
[48:51] God is Christ inside of
[48:55] you that should be the proof to
[48:58] you because if Christ is inside of
[49:01] you you'll obey his
[49:03] word. Praise the name of our Lord.
[49:06] You'll follow the
[49:07] word and you'll desire the
[49:11] word as so
[49:13] much because it is part of you or you
[49:17] are part of him. Praise the name of
[49:20] Lord. So you don't go by any
[49:24] emotion and you don't base on any
[49:28] emotion to prove that you have the
[49:31] baptism of the Holy Spirit. But let it
[49:33] be the life of Jesus
[49:35] Christ because you can have
[49:37] emotions when the Holy Ghost stopped on
[49:39] the human
[49:41] spirit. If the Holy Ghost goes to the
[49:44] soul, the question is is there an
[49:47] emotion in the soul?
[49:50] There's nothing. Praise the name of our
[49:53] Lord. So anointing is not
[49:56] emotion like here David. He was
[50:00] anointed and he stayed the way he was.
[50:03] But the Bible says the Holy Spirit came
[50:06] on
[50:07] him. He never prophesied. He never ran
[50:12] around. One was saying he did it but
[50:15] they didn't write it.
[50:18] Why do you want me to believe what what
[50:20] you are saying which is not
[50:25] written? You know people who like
[50:28] emotions they want to put it
[50:32] there. It happened but they did not
[50:34] write it. You don't
[50:38] even got the spirit but they didn't
[50:41] write it.
[50:44] Why do you want us to believe what was
[50:45] not written when what was written is
[50:47] there?
[50:49] And we have witnesses of
[50:52] this. Praise the name over and the Bible
[50:54] says a witness of two or
[50:58] three. Let it be
[51:00] established. We have David here a
[51:04] witness anointed without any
[51:07] emotion. We have Paul here anointed
[51:11] without any motion filled with the Holy
[51:14] Ghost without any
[51:15] emotion. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[51:18] have Christ when he was filled with the
[51:20] Holy Ghost on river Jordan. Did he
[51:24] prophesy? Did he run in the water
[51:27] around? Praise the name of our Lord.
[51:30] Three witnesses.
[51:34] So don't allow somebody to deceive
[51:36] you that because you've not felt any
[51:39] emotion, you don't have the Holy
[51:42] Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord.
[51:44] Even brother comes back and says the
[51:46] same thing the God
[51:51] revealed. Praise the name of our Lord.
[51:54] You know some
[51:55] people they want to look at
[51:58] emotion and then look you at emotion.
[52:03] Praise the name of our Lord. There's one
[52:05] who had those
[52:06] things and then at the end of the day
[52:10] they realized that they don't have the
[52:13] Holy
[52:14] Spirit. But they were caught up
[52:17] here. But where is the life of Jesus
[52:21] Christ? That's what you should look
[52:24] for. And to get the life of Jesus
[52:27] Christ, receive the word. Obey the word.
[52:31] It's not difficult.
[52:33] Praise the name of our Lord. So emotion,
[52:37] anointing is not
[52:39] emotion. David was
[52:42] anointed. There was no
[52:44] emotion. Jesus was filled with the Holy
[52:47] Ghost. No
[52:49] emotion. Paul was filled with the Holy
[52:51] Ghost. No
[52:54] emotion. Maybe you may say maybe they
[52:57] never had a
[53:00] spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. But
[53:02] here Jesus with the whole
[53:06] anointing. Praise the name of our Lord.
[53:09] Now in the book of Acts chapter 10 and
[53:11] verse
[53:13] 38 the Bible says how God anointed Jesus
[53:17] of
[53:18] Nazareth with the Holy Ghost with
[53:21] power who went about doing and healing
[53:24] all that were oppressed of the devil.
[53:27] For God was with him.
[53:45] praise the name of our Lord, he was
[53:48] anointed. Then in the book of Hebrews
[53:50] chapter
[53:51] 1 and then verse 8
[53:55] verse9 the Bible says but unto the but
[53:59] unto the son he saith thy throne oh God
[54:03] is forever and ever except of
[54:06] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[54:08] kingdoms
[54:23] [Music]
[54:30] Though hast loved righteousness and
[54:32] hated iniquity, therefore God, even thy
[54:35] God, has anointed thee with the oil of
[54:38] gladness above thy fellows.
[54:52] Praise the name of our God. He says he
[54:54] was anointed above his
[54:58] fellows. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[55:01] anointing is not
[55:04] emotions. In the Old Testament, they
[55:07] would anoint with oil.
[55:11] In the New Testament, it is the Holy
[55:15] Spirit which is the
[55:17] anointing. Praise the name of our Lord.
[55:19] It's the Holy Ghost that's the
[55:22] anointing. And so the Holy Ghost come
[55:25] down in our
[55:27] lives. We hear the word of God. We obey
[55:30] the word of God. We say, "Lord, here I
[55:33] am." And then the spirit of God comes
[55:36] down. So you are anointed.
[55:40] Praise the name of our Lord. You become
[55:42] anointed by the Holy
[55:45] Spirit. And now when you are anointed by
[55:48] the same Holy
[55:52] Spirit, praise the name of our Lord. Let
[55:55] us go to John chapter
[55:59] 14. John chapter
[56:02] 14 and then verse
[56:05] 12. He says, "Ververily I say unto you,
[56:10] he that believeth on me, the works that
[56:14] I do shall he do also, and greater works
[56:17] than these shall he do, because I go to
[56:19] my
[56:31] father." Praise the name of our Lord. He
[56:34] says you do the same
[56:36] work. So when you have the Holy Spirit
[56:39] in your
[56:40] life, praise the name of our Lord, you
[56:42] can do what Jesus
[56:45] did. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[56:47] just need to have that
[56:49] faith.
[56:50] Exercise. You know the promises of
[56:53] God, they come to pass in our
[56:57] lives. Like maybe you are a mother at
[57:00] home. At night, your child is sick.
[57:04] Take the promise of
[57:06] God. Lay your hand upon that sick
[57:10] child. Praise the name of the Lord. Pray
[57:13] to
[57:14] God what you want to be to that
[57:17] child. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[57:20] says you can do the same
[57:22] works. You can
[57:24] pray. You can claim
[57:27] anything in the name of Jesus
[57:30] Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[57:33] know, you need to see that you take the
[57:35] promises of
[57:37] God and let it come to
[57:41] pass. Praise the name of our Lord. Now,
[57:43] in the book of 1 John chapter
[57:47] 2, and then verse
[57:50] 27, the Bible says, "But the anointing
[57:54] which you have received of him abides in
[57:58] you.
[57:59] [Music]
[58:06] And you need not that any man should
[58:09] teach
[58:11] you, but as the same anointing teaches
[58:17] [Music]
[58:21] you of all
[58:24] things, and that is
[58:26] truth, and is no lie, and Even as it has
[58:31] taught
[58:33] you, you shall abide in
[58:37] him. Says we have received the
[58:39] anointing.
[58:41] What's the anointing? The Holy Spirit.
[58:44] So we have received the Holy Ghost from
[58:48] Christ. And then that Holy Ghost abides
[58:50] in
[58:52] us. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[58:54] then when the Holy Ghost is in
[58:56] us, he teaches us.
[59:00] He guides us in all
[59:02] truth. Praise the name of our Lord.
[59:05] Every
[59:06] Wednesday, we've been preaching about
[59:08] the Holy
[59:09] Ghost. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[59:12] for those who are unable to attend
[59:13] Wednesday
[59:15] services, you can always go back to our
[59:18] YouTube channel
[59:21] and then those are there quite a number
[59:23] of them on the Holy
[59:27] Ghost on the Holy
[59:30] Spirit and we still have about three or
[59:32] four more services on the Holy
[59:36] Spirit. What is the Holy Spirit?
[59:40] Just taking time that we take all this
[59:43] kind of doubts and unbelief about the
[59:45] Holy
[59:48] Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. God
[59:51] has given us the Holy
[59:52] Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[59:55] don't need to say, "Oh, when are we
[59:58] going to organize a general meeting
[1:00:02] around?" You can receive the Holy
[1:00:05] Spirit at any
[1:00:07] time as long as you hear the
[1:00:10] word. Open your heart, obey, desire for
[1:00:14] God. When the spirit comes
[1:00:16] down, that's what the scripture
[1:00:18] says. Praise the name of our Lord. As
[1:00:21] many as received
[1:00:23] him, to them he gave the
[1:00:26] power to become the sons of God.
[1:00:29] How can you say 5 years without the Holy
[1:00:33] Ghost? What's wrong with
[1:00:37] you? 10 years without the Holy
[1:00:40] Ghost, your understanding has something
[1:00:43] wrong because he has given us the Holy
[1:00:46] Spirit. So we go forward and receive the
[1:00:48] Holy
[1:00:50] Ghost. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:00:53] in John
[1:00:56] 14:26 the Bible says, "But the comforter
[1:01:00] which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father
[1:01:03] will send in my name, he shall teach you
[1:01:06] all things and bring all things to your
[1:01:09] remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
[1:01:12] you.
[1:01:25] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[1:01:28] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:01:31] the father will send in my
[1:01:33] name will teach you all
[1:01:36] things. Remind you all
[1:01:38] things. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:01:42] Anointing is not
[1:01:44] emotion. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:01:47] Now in the Old
[1:01:48] Testament they were using oil as
[1:01:58] anointing. Oh now Luganda mixes it or
[1:02:01] puts it together. They were using
[1:02:04] oil to
[1:02:10] anoint and you know Uganda is also
[1:02:14] funny when
[1:02:18] you know of petrol and
[1:02:24] paraffin but oil after
[1:02:34] Praise the name of the Lord. Like this
[1:02:36] anointing oil,
[1:02:40] olive oil, olive
[1:02:46] plant. Praise the name of they were
[1:02:49] using this kind of
[1:02:51] oil to anoint
[1:03:00] So they were anointing places of
[1:03:04] worship. They were anointing the
[1:03:08] priesthood. They were anointing oil to
[1:03:10] the
[1:03:11] kings and even prophets were
[1:03:15] anointed. But then Christ was the whole
[1:03:20] anointing as the high priest, as the
[1:03:24] great king, as the house of
[1:03:27] God, as the bread of
[1:03:29] life. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:03:32] Christ was the whole
[1:03:34] anointing. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:03:36] And even us
[1:03:38] now, we are
[1:03:41] anointed of the Holy Spirit. Praise the
[1:03:44] name of our Lord. So God anoints
[1:03:48] us and the anointing he gives us is the
[1:03:53] Holy Spirit
[1:03:54] himself. Now in the message the world is
[1:03:57] falling apart again.
[1:04:02] says the church cannot run without the
[1:04:04] power of
[1:04:07] God through the
[1:04:08] word and the Holy
[1:04:11] Spirit will confirm will only confirm
[1:04:15] the word of
[1:04:17] God for that's what it is to
[1:04:20] do the
[1:04:22] anointing is to confirm the
[1:04:26] word don't look for anointing without
[1:04:28] the
[1:04:29] word praise the name
[1:04:32] You'll be falsely
[1:04:36] anointed.
[1:04:38] Okay, you are a false vessel,
[1:04:44] but having the Holy
[1:04:47] Spirit. So, you can do the works of the
[1:04:49] Holy
[1:04:50] Spirit and live the life of the
[1:04:54] devil. That's what means the anointed
[1:04:57] ones at the end time.
[1:05:01] They have no seed of God inside of
[1:05:05] them. So the Holy Ghost comes to their
[1:05:08] human
[1:05:09] spirit. They can
[1:05:12] prophesy. They can speak in tongues.
[1:05:15] They can do
[1:05:16] miracles. But they are going to
[1:05:19] hell. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:05:22] Brother Brandham, when he went when he
[1:05:24] first went to the Pentecostal
[1:05:28] meetings, one person spoke in tongues
[1:05:31] and another person actually
[1:05:35] interpreted and then he took interest to
[1:05:37] find out what their life
[1:05:39] is and then he started you know going to
[1:05:42] speak to
[1:05:43] them so that he can catch their
[1:05:46] spirit and know what kind of life they
[1:05:49] have. So he went to the first one and he
[1:05:52] had a clean
[1:05:54] life,
[1:05:55] genuine. But then when he went to the
[1:05:58] other
[1:05:59] one, he was living with another
[1:06:02] woman, yet he's married and he had two
[1:06:05] children with that same
[1:06:06] woman. And then he asked God, is it
[1:06:09] really the Holy Spirit on this
[1:06:12] man? And then God showed him a
[1:06:16] vision how they they filled
[1:06:20] has the wheat and the
[1:06:23] tears. And then it was so dry and then
[1:06:27] they started crying. They started crying
[1:06:29] for
[1:06:31] rain. And now when it started
[1:06:33] raining, the wheat was
[1:06:36] rejoicing and even the tears were
[1:06:40] rejoicing. And then God made him go to
[1:06:42] Hebrews chapter
[1:06:45] 6. Praise the name of our Lord. We can
[1:06:48] take that scripture and read
[1:06:50] it. Hebrews chapter 6.
[1:06:54] And then
[1:06:55] verse seven,
[1:06:58] he says, "For the earth drinkketh in the
[1:07:01] rain that cometh upon
[1:07:06] it, and bringeth forth haps meat, for
[1:07:09] them by whom it is dressed, receiving
[1:07:10] the blessing from God.
[1:07:27] But that which beareth thorns and briers
[1:07:29] is rejected and is nigh unto cursing
[1:07:32] whose end is to be banned.
[1:07:47] So you see the rain
[1:07:48] coming. It blesses the
[1:07:54] hs and even the
[1:07:57] thorns. They grow up but the other one
[1:08:01] is burnt. The thorns and so
[1:08:05] on. Praise the name of our Lord. So now
[1:08:08] in this message we have been reading the
[1:08:10] world is falling again
[1:08:13] apart. The anointing is to confirm the
[1:08:16] word and Jesus was the anointed
[1:08:21] one. The word made flesh. That's the
[1:08:25] reason he walked out into the water
[1:08:29] there. He was the word coming to the
[1:08:33] prophets. He was baptized by the
[1:08:36] prophets.
[1:08:38] And then the prophet raised up and
[1:08:40] said, "I must
[1:08:42] decrease, I shall increase." We find
[1:08:45] that God's way of doing
[1:08:49] it. Praise the name of our Lord. Christ
[1:08:51] the word. The spirit came upon him.
[1:08:56] Praise the name of our message
[1:09:00] paradox. He said Christ is coming to his
[1:09:03] body.
[1:09:05] Christ is the word. We all know the
[1:09:08] anointing is
[1:09:10] Christ that comes on the
[1:09:13] word that makes the word
[1:09:16] live. That is the
[1:09:19] anointing. Christ is the
[1:09:22] anointing. The spirit that comes upon
[1:09:25] the
[1:09:26] word and quickens the
[1:09:29] word to make it live.
[1:09:33] Now the word is in your
[1:09:36] heart. You believe in divine
[1:09:40] healing. Whatever more and Christ the
[1:09:45] anointing coming to his
[1:09:48] body. See the connection
[1:09:51] there. Just like the husband and
[1:09:54] wife to become one.
[1:09:57] Now the church has got to get to the
[1:10:01] ministry. Until the church and
[1:10:04] Christ become
[1:10:07] one, he can anoint you for every
[1:10:09] blessing that's in the
[1:10:13] Bible. All of it is
[1:10:15] yours. Everything promised at this age
[1:10:18] is
[1:10:19] yours. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[1:10:22] says
[1:10:23] everything. We have been
[1:10:26] anointed. We've been blessed by the Holy
[1:10:29] Ghost so we can claim the promises of
[1:10:32] God. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:10:35] anointing is not
[1:10:38] emotion. The anointing praise the name
[1:10:42] of our Lord is the spirit of God coming
[1:10:46] down in us. And then the spirit of God
[1:10:50] will give us the
[1:10:52] ability will give us the power
[1:10:55] to live the life of Christ. Praise the
[1:10:57] name of our Lord. Whereby it's no longer
[1:11:00] I that
[1:11:01] live but Christ that lives in you.
[1:11:04] Praise the name of our Lord. On
[1:11:06] Wednesday, we are talking the earnest of
[1:11:08] the Holy
[1:11:10] Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:11:13] Meaning when he gives us the Holy
[1:11:15] Spirit, it shows there is more that is
[1:11:18] to
[1:11:19] come. He has given us a down payment.
[1:11:24] There is more that is
[1:11:25] coming. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:11:28] so the Holy Ghost in you will make you
[1:11:32] yearn for more of God in your
[1:11:36] life. The Holy Ghost in you will make
[1:11:39] you desire to know what's the will of
[1:11:42] God in this issue. How does the Lord
[1:11:45] want you to behave in this kind of
[1:11:46] issue? The Holy Ghost in you praise the
[1:11:49] name of he says I will not leave you
[1:11:51] comfortless.
[1:11:53] and then I will come unto
[1:11:55] you. Praise the name of our God. So you
[1:11:58] need to see that you yield your life to
[1:12:01] the spirit of
[1:12:03] God. And when the spirit of God is in
[1:12:06] you, you will be led of the spirit of
[1:12:09] God. Praise the name of you know an
[1:12:13] interesting scenario is
[1:12:14] here. God told Abraham, "Leave your
[1:12:18] country and got the land I'm going to
[1:12:21] show." And when Abraham reached the land
[1:12:23] of
[1:12:24] Canaan, praise the name of our Lord. The
[1:12:27] Bible says, even God showed him, I've
[1:12:30] given you this
[1:12:31] land. But then when he was in the land
[1:12:34] of
[1:12:34] Canaan, the Bible says, he lived in
[1:12:38] Cananan as a pilgrim and as a stranger.
[1:12:44] So cananan was like a down
[1:12:49] payment. Cananan was like the
[1:12:52] earnest of the eternal land that is
[1:12:56] coming. So when he was in Canaan, he
[1:13:00] looked for a city whose builder and
[1:13:03] maker is
[1:13:04] God. When we have the Holy
[1:13:07] Ghost, when you have the Holy Spirit in
[1:13:09] you, you will desire that kind of life.
[1:13:14] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[1:13:16] says in this body we
[1:13:19] groan. But why are you groaning? Because
[1:13:23] the spirit of God is telling you there's
[1:13:26] a better land than this. There's a
[1:13:29] better condition than this. Praise the
[1:13:31] name of our Lord. That should be our
[1:13:34] desire. Oh, I want to see him. I want to
[1:13:37] see his face. Praise the name of our
[1:13:39] Lord. Like brother Brana when he was
[1:13:42] beyond the curtain of time said I want
[1:13:44] to see
[1:13:46] Jesus. Praise the name of Lord. When the
[1:13:48] battle is won we shall wear a crown.
[1:13:52] Praise the name of our Lord. If the Holy
[1:13:55] Spirit gives you such expectation in
[1:13:58] life even when you don't have money,
[1:14:01] even when you are fully disappointed in
[1:14:03] the Lord, but you see where you are
[1:14:06] going. Praise the name of Lord. Even if
[1:14:08] you are sick,
[1:14:10] You know this is just
[1:14:11] temporary. There's a better life
[1:14:16] ahead like Paul when Paul was was in
[1:14:21] bonds before the kings and
[1:14:25] governors. And then he started preaching
[1:14:27] to
[1:14:28] them. Praise the name of Lord. And then
[1:14:30] he preached them the gracious word of
[1:14:33] God. And then he told the king, "Oh
[1:14:37] king, and all you noble people are
[1:14:40] here, I wish you were like
[1:14:44] me. The libert I have in the Lord
[1:14:47] Jesus." And then he said, "Except the
[1:14:49] bonds that I'm
[1:14:53] in." Now to them, he looked at the
[1:14:56] bonds. But to Paul, he looked at
[1:14:58] something which is eternal. And then he
[1:15:01] told them, "I wish you were like me.
[1:15:04] Praise the name of our Lord. Be honest
[1:15:06] of the Holy Spirit. We've just got a
[1:15:08] down
[1:15:10] payment. But there is greater things to
[1:15:13] come. What the Bible says, the eye has
[1:15:16] not seen. Your ears have not what God
[1:15:20] has prepared for
[1:15:21] them. Praise the name of God. So when
[1:15:24] you receive the word of God, take it
[1:15:26] with all your heart and allow the word
[1:15:29] of God to transform
[1:15:31] you. But then you don't allow the devil
[1:15:34] to get you into evil things, to get you
[1:15:37] into evil thoughts, to get you into any
[1:15:40] kind of living which is not
[1:15:42] right. We have something better before
[1:15:45] us than what the world can give unto us.
[1:15:49] Praise the name of just desire more of
[1:15:52] God. Lord, I long for you. Lord, I need
[1:15:56] you. Not that you don't have
[1:15:58] him, but you want more of him. Praise
[1:16:02] the name of more of
[1:16:04] God. God, better life. Praise the name
[1:16:09] of our Lord. Where you are more
[1:16:11] obedient, where you have a better
[1:16:13] understanding, where you make better
[1:16:15] decisions. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:16:18] That should always be our longing all
[1:16:19] the
[1:16:20] time. Lord, come down in my life. Lord,
[1:16:23] I need more of you. Lord, I need more
[1:16:26] fellowship. Lord, I need more
[1:16:28] communion. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:16:31] Like we are going for the communion.
[1:16:33] Praise the name of Lord. Let it be a
[1:16:35] continual thing in our
[1:16:37] lives. At our home, as an individual,
[1:16:41] you have time with the
[1:16:43] Lord. Don't wait when you are together
[1:16:45] and say, "Let me wait for that time.
[1:16:48] Take time as an individual and have
[1:16:52] fellowship with God. Let the goodness of
[1:16:55] God come down in your life. The goodness
[1:16:58] of God come down in your life. If the
[1:17:00] Lord is in you, you be able to bless
[1:17:04] others. Praise the name of our Lord. May
[1:17:06] God bless
[1:17:07] you. Amen.
[1:17:10] Amen. Let us sing that song. Oh, I want
[1:17:13] to see him.
[1:17:15] song leads us into
[1:17:18] worship and then we can each of us
[1:17:21] pray and then we prepare for the Lord's
[1:17:25] supper. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:17:28] us stand up and sing that song
[1:17:30] together just to rejoice before the
[1:17:33] Lord. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:17:39] As I journey through this one, singing
[1:17:43] as I
[1:17:45] go, pointing souls to
[1:17:50] calary, to the crimson
[1:17:54] floor. Any arrows fears my soul from
[1:18:00] without
[1:18:03] within but my love lift me on through
[1:18:08] him I must win.
[1:18:11] Halleluah. Oh I want to
[1:18:15] see him and look upon his face.
[1:18:21] They are to sing
[1:18:25] forever of his saving
[1:18:29] gra on the streets of glory.
[1:18:35] Let me lead my
[1:18:37] voice. Will open the home and love ever
[1:18:45] to rejoin.
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:19:02] He will give me
[1:19:06] life. Let
[1:19:08] darkness my
[1:19:11] soul my
[1:19:14] love. Oh by my
[1:19:18] love I am
[1:19:21] this be. Hallelu.
[1:19:25] Oh, I want to see
[1:19:29] him and look upon his
[1:19:32] face with there to sing
[1:19:37] forever.
[1:19:42] Oh, all the sweets of
[1:19:47] glory. Let
[1:19:51] me cancel.
[1:19:54] Oh my love, ever to
[1:20:01] rejoice
[1:20:03] when all
[1:20:05] I
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:10] to be home. My
[1:20:14] savior is leading in
[1:20:18] the will where we attend the highest
[1:20:23] place.
[1:20:27] Oh, he's guiding me. I can
[1:20:32] see as I open. Brother, sister, who I
[1:20:39] want to see. My Lord
[1:20:46] knows there to see forever.
[1:20:52] Oh
[1:20:55] s will hold the streets of
[1:21:00] glory. Let me lift my
[1:21:04] heart.
[1:21:07] Oh, all my
[1:21:10] life I do to rejoice.
[1:21:15] when it be lost
[1:21:20] [Music]
[1:21:23] right now for my savior
[1:21:30] in the
[1:21:32] heart. We got
[1:21:34] [Music]
[1:21:42] together
[1:21:43] and I can see he has my own. Oh, I want
[1:21:50] to see. Oh, I want to
[1:21:55] see
[1:22:00] God sing
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:08] forever.
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:13] Oh, let me live my
[1:22:17] voice. Oh, gather.

[1:42:47] blood of
[1:42:52] love.
[1:42:55] Glory to
[1:43:00] Amen. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:43:03] I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:43:06] Christ. So we are starting our
[1:43:10] session the Lord's supper then we shall
[1:43:14] follow it by foot
[1:43:15] washing. Let us stand up and take the
[1:43:19] scripture 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:43:23] 11. We're reading from verse
[1:43:27] 23 up to verse 26.
[1:43:33] The Bible says, "For I have received of
[1:43:36] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:43:40] unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:43:42] night in which he was betrayed, took
[1:43:55] bread, and when he had given thanks, he
[1:43:59] broke it and said, "Take
[1:44:01] This is my body which is broken for you.
[1:44:04] This do in remembrance of
[1:44:15] me. After the same manner also he took
[1:44:19] the cup when he had sapped saying, "This
[1:44:22] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[1:44:26] Do as you of drink it in remembrance of
[1:44:42] me. For as often as you eat this bread
[1:44:45] and drink this cup, you do show forth
[1:44:48] the Lord's death till he come.
[1:45:01] Whereforeever shall eat this bread and
[1:45:03] drink this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:45:06] shall be guilty of the body and the
[1:45:08] blood of the Lord.
[1:45:22] But let a man examine himself and so let
[1:45:25] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:45:36] cup. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[1:45:39] that's why we take some bit of
[1:45:41] time you know on
[1:45:44] meditation seeking the grace of God.
[1:45:47] Praise the name of our Lord. Before
[1:45:49] Christ or before
[1:45:52] God, none of us is
[1:45:55] worthy. But when we take on his
[1:45:59] blood, we have become worthy. Praise the
[1:46:02] name of our Lord. So that's why you know
[1:46:04] it say Lord have mercy upon him in this
[1:46:06] area. Lord have mercy. This kind of
[1:46:08] weakness you know just call upon his
[1:46:11] name. You know, just like that man who
[1:46:14] went to the
[1:46:15] temple, a
[1:46:17] publican, and the Bible says he would
[1:46:19] not cast his eyes to
[1:46:22] heaven. Lord have mercy upon
[1:46:25] me. The Pharisee who went in the temple,
[1:46:29] started saying, "I fast two times a
[1:46:30] week. I pay titles of all that I have. I
[1:46:34] do good works." Jesus said, "The
[1:46:37] publican went back when he's justified.
[1:46:42] while the public the
[1:46:44] the good for
[1:46:46] him. So that's the same thing we do
[1:46:49] also. Lord grace in my weaknesses. Lord
[1:46:54] help me in my
[1:46:56] failures. You know that's how you call
[1:46:58] upon the name of God. So let us pray.
[1:47:02] Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:47:04] Christ, we thank you for this
[1:47:07] opportunity that Lord, we've come before
[1:47:09] you, Lord. And as you were doing this,
[1:47:12] Lord, we're doing it by your
[1:47:15] commandment that as often as we
[1:47:18] can. We could we take the bread
[1:47:21] symbolizing your
[1:47:24] body and also we partake of the wine
[1:47:26] symbolizing your
[1:47:28] blood, the blood of the New Testament.
[1:47:32] whereby we are enjoined unto
[1:47:34] Christ by his blood. We pray that father
[1:47:38] you may forgive us of all
[1:47:40] unrighteousness. Give us of all
[1:47:43] unworthiness every one of us who is
[1:47:46] here. I believe there's nobody who has
[1:47:49] stayed up to this
[1:47:50] time who really doesn't want to do what
[1:47:53] your commandment does.
[1:47:55] Therefore pray may give grace to each
[1:47:57] and every one of
[1:47:58] us that the blood of Jesus Christ may
[1:48:02] wash from all
[1:48:05] unrighteous. Make us clean and make us
[1:48:08] worthy that you can be able to dine on
[1:48:11] your
[1:48:11] table. Father, even as we dine from your
[1:48:15] table, the physical
[1:48:18] elements, may we be blessed by this,
[1:48:21] Lord, and all that you've ordained, oh
[1:48:25] God, how we can be blessed, Lord. May we
[1:48:29] be blessed by obedience to your
[1:48:31] word. Be with us through this session,
[1:48:33] Lord.
[1:48:35] Lord we pray for the bread we are going
[1:48:36] to
[1:48:38] break
[1:48:41] bread that we meet the purpose Lord for
[1:48:45] the Lord is supper we thank you and
