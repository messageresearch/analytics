amen and so I'm happy to be among my own hallelujah hallelujah amen this morning Papa was talking to us and then he was literally preaching praise the Lord and I felt real calm in the spirit and blessed to tap again from him amen amen greetings from my wife on the children Hallelujah uh of all times this is the time my wife has felt the pain to miss to come here she felt the pain of missing to come yeah but it's because of the responsibility back home I believe at God's appointed time she'll be here amen I bring you greetings from a few brethren we met they love you with the Christian love amen and this morning uh uh in the ministry there is uh you feel irrelevant you feel worthless of less importance when what only makes you comfortable is when we look back to the Cross that's where amen so I got to know our precious brother here uh brother Titus and he he loves the Lord and dad being a father uh he said bring him over praise be to the name of the Lord amen just like I've said before that you know it really feels irrelevant sometimes to think you're relevant I think that's why in Luke 1710 after you've done all that you're supposed to do praise the Lord you just have to stay cool and know that whatever you've done it is just what you supposed to do so this morning based on that scripture I believe we are just here to do what the Master's called us to do uh I thank pastor I'm really finding it since we I call him Pastor it is always easier to say Dad and Mom bless you Pastor meeting him has never left me the same meeting him has never left me the same and I came here last time have never come to say thank you to say thank you so much uh for your support for the carja missions I delivered your gift and it's a blessing to those people down there there is a time I really was burning to come and each time we made appointment to come I failed to come about three times so finally when it was burning and burning and eating me up uh so I really wanted to come then one day I got a dream I shared recently I came here and then Pap come and preach and when I came to preach I opened my Bible and I had nothing to preach so I said now ahuh I might be going so at God's appointed time I have officially now come to say thank you God richly bless you and thank you Dad so much amen God bless you you are welcome to the house of the Lord yeah um there was a time when Israel was invaded under the time of sa they had one many battles but there come up one battle and in this battle the general was a man of war and he was a giant his name was called gor his voice was of like a trumpet he say will come and begin War over the field and then sa would sink all the other men of War would sink and the man challenged them for a period of one week and over that one week he was gaining more ground amen he was taking more land and now he would Shout again Israel would back up but one time there was a father called Jess he had Sons on the battlefield and he felt for them he called his son David from the grazing field to take food for his Brethren so he took the food he came to the I mean to the battlefield and now his big [Music] brother said this is Dangerous Ground you now run back home and David from this angle came to this angle and he was hiding among the people and he was asking who is this circumcised Philistine who is challenging the people then sees him we told you to go back home he says okay okay he disappears from there he comes there and now the story went through the battlefield that there is a young man who has got a testimony amen that he killed a bear he killed a lion with his bare hands and he say who is this uncircumcised Philistine who challenging the armies of God they didn't call them the armies of Israel the armies of God do you know we are armies of God here oh my amen we are not the armies of the ginger Tabernacle but we are the armies of God Amen so the word goes around soul and so for I mean for David told him his testimony he told him now that's very good you know when you go to war you you you have to put on the armor and then Saul stood sh above every man and then David was just but a little boy and when he tried those Amazon he said these are too big for me we believe in a god who doesn't give Victory to big numbers because there are too many they might said this is our arm I mean our strength which has given us the victory you remember in the time of jidon God said no these men are too many and so he took them on the final examination on how to drink the water and then remained with about 300 people are you together with me so it's the same way with this little Dev he threw off these armor and he didn't need a spear he need need nothing he came in his own way the god way he picked five little Stone to a man of war praise God and when David started to advance man started you come to me like a dog and then David started swinging one time two times three times five times he released the stor and the only spot where go had left so that his face could bre through that's where the stone went once and he was down listen the warrior was just a child hallelujah hallelujah and today the warrior is just a child amen amen praise the Lord the Lord knows how to use his people he's a university student and then some people invited him here he knew our brother and the brother told me I've got a minister from Zambia and we always have open doors for men of are you ready to hear from the Lord amen brother Joshua where are you and sing The Warrior is just a child amen and we are ready to

H every upon their hearts Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus so glad to be here this morning and to see all of you and to see our Elder amen amen how many can say praise God it's so good to be here amen and I thank you so much Pastor for inviting me over amen God bless you brother jofrey Amen brother jofrey is the one who made it who spoke to the Elder that he has a minister from Zambia and this is the reason we this morning amen you may be seated uh when we come in the house of God we come to the house of our father amen we are not in our neighbor's home in our neighbor's home we are in our our father's house and every child in his father's house has Liberty hallelujah hallelujah you know a house of God is not a building amen so when we say we are in the house of God we don't mean this building we mean in the spirit of God in the presence of God because we the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there hallelujah hallelujah amen brother that's why you must feel free I'm not even a visitor here I'm not a visitor it's just that you forgot me amen but if God can only allow you to go Beyond eternity you and I are seated together right now in heaven hallelujah hallelujah and this is what the message of the hour has come to do is to introduce to the real you hallelujah hallelujah to introduce you to your theop for the foundation of the world you existed in the mind of God never just existed like a cloud no no no no no no the Bible says Where Are You Jo when the sons of God shouted for a cloud can never shout you are in your body called theop hallelujah hallelujah and in the Bible days they never such a deeper Revelation to know that it was a theop that's why when Peter was jailed while the Believers were praying for him Peter appeared before them and they said no it might it must be an angel of Peter amen they thought they called Everything Angels thanks be to God from Malachi 4 who taugh us that it was not just Angels but we have a over and as the opening of the SE came to us God brought back our theop amen and we are just right close to Eternity hallelujah hallelujah that's why it's homegoing time praise be to God uh I came here under uh I was invited by brother Marvin amen because uh I think uh he noticed that my work is kind of like missionary work amen so he invited me over so I was in May I'm really forgetting the other part where I were you know names you know this dust is from Zambia so is acquainted with the Zambian language he acquainted with Zambian language God bless you my brother I can see your youth amen amen so I'm forgetting the names amen so I came last week and uh we passed through Ginger it seems the Lord wanted me to deal with the Eastern side of because again we are back I went back to cala so I travel back toia and then now I'm back again amen so uh the Lord helped us uh people believe the message amen that's the greatest story we can ever tell that's the greatest testimony we can ever give is when a sinner come back to his maker amen so some Souls were baptized I participated in the the baptizing of those SS Amen in in the first day uh the in one service in one one one meeting 30 were baptized amen and the lord gave us Grace to but even some Pentecostal pastors realize that there's a message hallelujah hallelujah and they gladly receive the word amen just like with the Gentiles when the message came from Israel we gentle people received it gladly and so did they amen and by God's grace even a new church was planted amen uh our Ministries have been given in different kinds yet The Same Spirit one is called to be a pastor the other one is called to be an evangelist some are called to be Apostles others prophets amen all for the glory of God I'm not M of anything else I just fit whever the Lord wants me to be Amen in my walk with God in my walk with god I've always desired to see people people repent and come to the Lord amen I think at a very tender age I think near that age of my brother because I'm I'm a bit I'm a bit older than you see me my body is always smaller than my age amen so I started evangelizing when I was a very young boy amen and that has been my life know that I've never failed the Lord I feel the Lord every day amen do we have young people here because the devil tell you no you're bad look at that young brother he's doing that and that but you a bad boy tell the devil we all make mistakes but a warrior is one who Rises amen so in my work with Christ that's when I just began but I I used to be a local Evangelist amen I did much evangelism in my primary school secondary school and when I left my secondary school I went where there was no message and after staying there there's a message uh there are message Believers now amen that was in 2018 amen 2018 that's the first time the Lord used me to do something really for the message where people would believe the message and that was a first church amen and from there the Lord has made me move place to place amen until he spoke to me again to go to an area where there was no message and the Lord did something wonderful there also and there's a church so when I came brother JY never knew but I'm also a pastor amen because I never told him the reason I never told him because I don't feel that call upon my life I don't feel the call of a pass upon my life so after the church came to a certain level there are other men of God who took up amen and uh the nature of my Ministry I rarely sit in one place amen yeah so you can see the design of my Ministry yeah I I travel that's my nature but we haven't yet orain the pastors so but I don't call myself one I don't call myself a pastor it's not in my call maybe the Lord one day will call me to be a pastor but he hasn't called me yet so I believe the Lord will help you this morning because it's not about a man hallelujah hallelujah there's a reason why I did what I've done because you don't me that's why the apostles would write in their letters when they writing to the churches in galtia in thessalonica they say Paul the Apostle of God Peter the Apostle of God he needed to introduce who he is in the body ofr hallelujah hallelujah so that people can have confidence confidence in him amen and because of work of the Lord he has added an extra Grace the grace of healing designment of spirits and a prophetic gift amen so I'm very sure by the time you go out of this place if you are sick you realize sickness will have left you amen because when I'm standing here healing becomes natural there Amen in every service I've preached in every service I've preached I've seen people come to church with medicine because in case the devil catches them all their Church they will take this medicine and while I'm preaching like this the presence of God will come down and they just find themselves they healed hallelujah hallelujah amen so you believe with your heart and God will touch you whever you are one thing I know you shall never be the same because you're in the presence of God hallelujah hallelujah uh we can stand on our feet you forgive me I'm not I'm not a good speaker yeah but uh you have to make sense to everything amen you know when you young you don't hold the spear very [Music] well you hold shivering so but thank God even if the stone you know even if David threw the stone and it went to the other side because God was determined to bring Goliath down Stone would have still gone back to go Hallelujah huj so the stone will still come back to your problem hallelujah hallelujah I will open in the Bible in the book of Ephesians Ephesians 4 verse 4 the Bible says there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and you know all but un every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he said when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men hallelujah hallelujah and then on verse 11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man and to the measure of the St of the fullness of Christ that we have be no more children toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the S of men and canning craft whereby they lie in way to deceive whereby they lie in way to deceive but speaking in the truth in love may grow up into him all in all things which is the head even Christ from from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint surly according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto theing of itself in love amen God bless you you may be seated amen amen uh you when go willing uh I'll be back in December to the same place amen uh there are many Pentecostal pastors who would want to to hear so we are trying to organize a meeting with them and we expect more than 300 of them to attend actually even 600 but the list is 200 amen we had a wonderful time with the Elder uh you know by Nature I don't know if I talk a lot but by Nature I observe I like to I pay attention and observe so I observe everything when I visit a place H the Elder is very sound is very sound and I'm very sure you must be you must have been enjoying amen uh yeah you can do that please you can and you see one thing I saw uh we have to grow to maturity amen and this is how this is the example God has given us the message everyone can try to explain the message in accordance to how God has shown them but uh the point of it is we must come to maturity you know when one matures the greatest thing that comes is understanding amen I think what to differentiate a child from an old man or a child from a big person the difference is also in understanding of things amen I might not really explain fully but uh we need people like him especially in this time you see it's not everything that is the message many things accompan the message the message is the revelation of the word and no man can teach you a revelation Christ himself the father reveals it in your heart and that no man can explain no one can explain you in and can explain you out it's between the lines of Simons hallelujah hallelujah so may God bless you Elder uh I've always wanted to meet people who speak like you you see again maturity people think you're a compromiser when you have matur really people think you a compromiser imagine Paul telling Paul telling Timothy say don't just be drinking water by be taking some wine because of your stomach problem imagine that the Apostle and people be like this man is a compromiser but you see you you grow and understand what salvation is hallelujah hallelujah there are many times I remember brother Brenham took cigarettes so that man was dying in hospital he was not trying that man he was not trying that man he meant taking cigarettes there because he realized the body needed that that body was addicted to that is still working on him he needed that oh brother this message that's why we have so many many doctrines but as we grow we are getting to the maturity to understand better hallelujah hallelujah you see we become hard on one another there are many times Apostle Paul repented in the Bible one day he excommunicated a brother who slept with the concubine of his [Music] father if you read in the first letter the book The Letter to the Corinthians and he said many bad things there say that that one should not even supposed you shouldn't don't even be found with him cast him out and then in the second letter he repents he say we were not supposed to be hard on him amen are you here we were not supposed to be hard on him such a one bring him close perhaps the enemy may take advantage of him uh Christ is trying to build his church into love that's why the the last step is love you can have faith you can have knowledge can have virtue you can have Temperance can have brotherly kindness but above all that you must be kept in love because this is is a love story that Christ left the throne and became a man that through him we can have salvation that's why Paul at the end of it all he said bear one with another hallelujah hallelujah bear one with another to Bear brother is so hard if I give this Bible say bear for me brother when you just get it in the first one hour this Bible be very light but as you it for five days the Bible become as holding the whole building on your you're holding the whole building very heavy and that's what bearing is you can bear with a brother but for how long are you going to bear that proves your love for the hallelujah hallelujah there's something brother bam was attaining in all his sermons God sent him to build back the image of God that image that can bear with us hallelujah hallelujah God so much bears with us we ourselves are not even worthy of his meres because he can bear hallelujah hallelujah are we together uh there's something very important that we must understand as we move from Perfection to perfection God wants us to move to a certain level hallelujah hallelujah and that level is the level where he is be perfect even as your father is perfect but remember you can never be perfect without love hallelujah hallelujah the only thing that will make you see no mistake in your brother is when you come in perfect love because where there is love brother there is no sin for love covers multitude of Hallelujah Hallelujah there's where a Believer must work is in the mid of love that's why love is the greatest thing that you can ever receive that's the most perfect gift above prophecies where prophecies shall fail love will overcome hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you believe love is the greatest gift yes that's what our Prophet taught us say watch for that man who has love someone can be jumping and saying praise praise God blessed be the name of the Lord he can speak in tongues Divine Healing miracles but you watch for that man who has Divine love in his that's the man to watch hallelujah hallelujah and con a more excellent gift desire a more excellent gift the gift that the Holy Ghost himself shall come and dwell in you that's the only time you can have love one for another Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the the prophet say the devil can impersonate anything any that is prophetic whether teaching whatever gift there is the devil shall impersonate but he cannot impersonate love because God is love and for you to get to a certain level of love it takes a certain level of your dedication as well consistently feasting on the word character that comes character is not developed as a gift character is a result of certain trials and for you to have this kind of a love God has to give you a certain Trust and that certain Tri brother shall be so real shall be so real you allow people to step on your soul and when you say but brother why are you doing this give you a good what is God trying to achieve in you he wants you to have Temperance so if you you keep failing they step on you you say bad words they still failing the test you are still on grade one God will not make you cross over to another stage he will bring another one maybe this one will not step on you but this like just give you a good until you move from that step until you reach can say father forgive them they do not know what they doing hallelujah hallelujah God is trying to make you an image hallelujah hallelujah that's I want to chare with you this morning in the few minutes my message will be titled the ministry to the threefold of your being the ministry to the threefold of your being amen the ministry to the threefold of your being we know very well that you are a three you a three-fold being you are a body there's a spirit and there's a soul and there's a Ministry that God has sent to deal with the threefold of your hallelujah hallelujah and this ministry is the ministry of the Lord Jesus CH Christ hallelujah hallelujah God bless you precious mother we know when we are coming I tasted a very good spirit on her amen God bless you so much you must be good spirited you must be good spirited that's what to change this world it's not Aon Aon is good enough and backed by a life amen the ministry to the threefold of your being I want to tell you something that this brother there's nothing that you will lose on the resurrection morning sometimes we feel like this body will be wasted entirely there's nothing that will be lost the only that will be done this body shall put on immortality hallelujah hallelujah so God has sent a Ministry what Ministry is that it's the ministry of Christ this ministry has complies of different gifts hallelujah hallelujah all these gifts must work in harmony to bring this body again hallelujah hallelujah and you know the problem we have today is that we all want to be one part of the body of Christ we all want to be the leg and if a brother tries to say no brother me I'm a hand with feel like the outcast but you see Paul says there's one body and many parts all these parts they carry out and help you to do your daytoday work just because you're eating and it doesn't mean you don't need your your legs at every appointed time each part of your body be important they are very essential body parts that you don't even see that you don't even see but they are very important in your body and if you are to remove them brother you not even leave for 2 minutes we can remove your eyes but when we remove your heart that's your end we can remove your leg but if we remove your LS that's your end yet the only visible thing we see and we appreciate so much we appreciate our legs we appreciate our hands we appreciate our ears and we don't appreciate the heart we don't appreciate the intestines we don't appreciate the other parts just because we don't see them hallelujah hallelujah sometimes we don't appreciate one another in the body of Christ just because those other parts are not seen there must be an evangelist who must go out there to take that sinner to bring him to Christ and for that sinner it's not just enough to be born again no if you were just born you the [Music] baby would you have achieved what you have achieved there was need for growth hallelujah hallelujah remember God is our father he is in charge of our growth he's in charge of our and he moves us from one human being to another human being just like when a child is born the prophet talks about leadership the child be the leadership of a man until a certain stage and from that stage you come in the leadership of the Father the leadership of the father you'll be ushered in by into a teacher who will teach you the physical things of life you will not say no me I'm a Believer I don't need to do engineering you die wither and go to heaven Hallelujah Hallelujah you must understand the physical part because you're not just a spirit you need to dress you not John the [Applause] Baptist hallelujah hallelujah you're not John the Baptist understand your purpose and you're not Jesus the Christ flesh that's Jesus of Na you not that one you you are you so if you neglect you neglect your part you die ear and you know what we run to heaven heaven is not even where we are supposed to be God created us to be here amen this is where he wanted us to be just a sin came and Confused the whole thing and this is why God sent a Ministry to do to bring back theen again the condition so that we can dwell now here ET but we all run to heaven and when we reach heaven under the alt we cry for how long are we going to be father because we are not meant to be there hallelujah hallelujah meant to eat amen and and now we have people who want to fast 40 days and 40 nights why are you competing with Jesus Brothers you see you must know your will the prophet say you just lose all your teeth you lose your teeth Jesus fasted all those days because he was supposed to meet [Applause] death he was caring the burden of the whole rest including the first Adam's burden was upon him but we want also to you see we we shouldn't be like Pentecost Pentecost are noices when they just he this one fasted for 500 times they go do that our Prophet just fasted the highest was three days because you see you can't cause you can't force an angel to visit you and that's a problem we want to have a supernatural encounter like of Paul of Peter you walk in your destiny and if your purpose is raised for that will send an angel hallelujah hallelujah and we have so many people who are going up anywhere anything they have lost their way that's God has sent us a Ministry and the ministry is not one man all of us Grace is given in accordance to the gift of Christ in us hallelujah hallelujah amen amen you know what the the Apostle says but unto everyone of us is given Grace according to the measure now you see the issue of it is that all people want to have a high calling all people want to have a high measure of the gift of Christ all people want to become the hand you can never be except he makes you be if I come here and I want to do it like the pastor I'll not help you amen if I come here and I want to do it like my brother I not help you I must come here and do it according to the purpose he has placed over my life it's not how much you fast no it's in accordance to your purpose I want to help you brother because you will St starting just to see a vision which is not in your purpose first thing I want to see a vision yet the whole Bible is full of vision you want to see a vision you see there's a problem with you are not t right hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you something it's not fasting that brought the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost it is not fasting that made the angel appear before Cornus no just at the angel found him while maybe he was praying but some people the angel found them while they even doing their own activities like Moses and boom what's what's happening why because it's the Plan of Redemption belongs to God it's not your prayers it's not your prayers Lord use me uh-uh if God wants to use you even when you're in a b even when you're in a b you just he maybe it cannot be so Supernatural like this but you speak to you somehow you find yourself you're out of that life because he has a purpose for you no man has ever s God God himself it's only when he wants to go in the Bible you never see where an angel appeared because a man wanted a visitation you never find such whenever God sent an angel it was because a prophecy was about to be fulfilled some people they say Daniel fasted for 21 days and the angels appeared let's be realistic did the Angels come from the Throne of God on the 2 25th day immediately began the firstest the prince of TI whichever but we know it's a devil healed the angel with the message it's not the prayer of Daniel that that that energized the the Angel God saw was needing for the angel to be delivered he released the Angel Michael the angel of battles hallelujah hallelujah why because there was a Prophet by the Prophet Jeremiah to say the 7 in the 70th God was to deliver them hallelujah hallelujah you must know what is written about your life what gave the Lord Jesus Christ Authority was not because of 4 days ands the prophet say he knew his scriptural position he knew the hour and season he knew where he was standing and this is what to give us victory over the kingdom of darkness is to know the hour we are living in the Bible say in the evening time it shall be light Hallelujah God is going to call out a bride because God cannot do without a man you call a man hallelujah hallelujah it's not because I'm praying when we are born God raise us up we don't receive gifts now receive a spiritual gift which which gift are you me there's a gift that you are born with amen and it's not because you're praying you know I've been with brothers who they say brother I cannot preach I haven't prayed I haven't prayed uhuh when you put your youro on prayer say I just have to do this after I pray what about before there was prayer because prayer just came in recently in the Garden of Eden there was no prayer Point were they having prayer point in the Garden of Eden so let's pray about this no brother no and if you go to battle because you have a spear of prayer you not overcome go your hope must be on the word because he promised he can never fail hallelujah hallelujah I've often wondered there are times when you know some time ago I would go among his brothers brothers would pray maybe I found them they have been praying for days me the very day I start praying that same day I begin to pray with them I begin to erupt into visions and now they want to see Visions also you see you can never be what God has never called you to be John the bti never did any Miracle which was John the Baptist Healing The Sick he never did any Miracle but he the greatest commission ever so are you you grasp my point I think so far youas what is Jesus trying to achieve is he trying to achieve to make you and I gifted why that could be a very poor reason he sent gifts teaching gifts Apostolic gifts gifts healing gifts Miracle gifts for what so that the church can have gifts no so that we through those operations can be rais to the image of the Son of God but look you can never go to heaven because you you know singing can never preach you into heaven but it's needed in church right healing can never take you to heaven but you need it while you're here spirits that bother [Music] you must meet a certain gift also because sometimes you can be seated in church you hear the word of God say stop this and you even know but you you go anyhow and continue living like that so there's need also God to say okay I'll send you a gift that will tell you your secrets so that at least you have some levels of fear for God you have some level of fear for God but you see that gift also can never take you to heaven because you realize that people begin to fear you more than they fear their God and they just see the brother coming they they go this other way they afraid of the brother then you realize that at the end of the day there's something real that must come to you to make you a new being and that's the word of God hallelujah hallelujah but you see not every of us is called to teach not everyone of us is called to evangelize not everyone of us is called to just help but we all put together makes the ministry of the Lord Jesus this is the reason we have to appreciate one another there's a sister can have a des just to sing let's say praise the Lord because that's the measure of the grace upon our life amen there are small parts in our body there are small parts on our body there are fingers that even if you remove you still be able if you remove this one you still be able to survive and touch things but you not be those who are married with you have a marriage ring you don't have this finger then you'll be like Oh Praise the Lord you have you're not dead you're alive but you not be beautiful but it's so useless add something on your there are certain gifts that we can have that may be so much useless to us say me I just dream dreams and those dreams sometimes they are not really direct and you go and fast for 50 days so that you can know don't do that you just be a believer God himself knows where to position hallelujah hallelujah you remember the message adoption the prophet talks about some families some man can just be adopted to give birth to a preacher just to give birth to a preacher that's their position in Christ the adoption hallelujah hallelujah and that's the reason why you face what you face because sometimes we admire if only I was brother bham yet you're eating every day brother Ben was born they never had food you your food every day and then you're saying if only was brother Bram are you getting me I wish I was brother know Des not to be him we only want the good part and we forget what it is behind the back the difficult part let me tell you something there's a time that when you are called to preach I wish I never started it's only when you're not working in your purose that's when things become easy because you don't have the devil in that lane because the lane is so clear there's no devil to interrupt oh brother but when you walk in your purpose you understand that oh God I never I never never came here that's the reason men of God ran away no one will force you to F if you're a man of God appetite you know when to and when not to come appetite you know when to and when not to come you know some Believers be like brother are you excited you know when they see you travel from place to place country to Country they feel like oh it's an exciting thing know when I was coming to Uganda I met a brother by the mall then he he thought I didn't know him then when I greeted him was very excited then he was like brother when are you going out you know they want even to follow when are you going out good then I said I'm going on this state how how you feeling like you know like it's exciting right then I said no brother it's not exciting I've never been excited to travel in all places I've gone I'm always very sober I was telling brother jofrey there's no wor soldier who goes on aatt excited oh today we are fighting with America know this is what I was waiting for this is what I was waiting for America you know even footballers as much as it is exciting for you outside watching oh ronal it's not exciting with Ronald because if it was exciting have been sming the whole but the whole much and when they capture them even the celebration they never expected the go it's very different when you begin to walk in your purpose I was telling brother jofrey I used to be a very fire preacher I used to be a very fire preacher be people used to enjoy that but God took that away when I begin to walk in my purpose hallelujah hallelujah God will make you weak when you trust in your chariots when you trust in your chariots you have pained your chariots this is the chariot that we use today to fight and it's all tinted a very welled Ministry shall do less that's why God to put some dance on it hallelujah hallelujah and people don't understand the point on the man of God that mistake that is God putting the on it so that you shouldn't trust your chariot hallelujah hallelujah strange it's strange right but that's how God works when Paul has elevated so much with abundances of Revelations a th was given also to him accom a great ministry great ministry to Humble you so that you shouldn't trust in the tinted of your ministry put your confidence in him who started the hallelujah hallelujah and many times we have those tinted parts of our body because we feel we need to have this for us to do this and God remov the this that you wanted to do for that he say today I'll meet es he sent his family and remained alone I don't know maybe wanted to change [Music] and some Spears and met the angel of God hallelujah hallelujah how opposite instead of the Angel to give him muscles hit him on the hip and he went liing for war God will weaken you so you shouldn't trust in your ability God is determined to bring forth a bride behold I saw heaven open and there's much much noise in heaven and the Bride made herself ready there going to be a bride in now it's not because they are power of preachers but it is because God said so Le you must walk your purpose how that God is so much in special way when a man is called in their first calling they become so much powerful in their second phase they become so powerful in their third phas they become so weak and that was the ministry of our prophet in the first pool powerful Ministry physically speaking but the most power time was when it seemed as though the message was about defeated Hallelujah Hall it's in those moments when we feel we about to be defeated then Jesus comes hallelujah hallelujah when we feel we are now about to give up then Jesus comes Hallelujah huah the are many times that we have fought throughout ourselves we have organized Crusades we have we have entered into evangelism but it has never worked but there's a time when Jesus comes and when he comes you don't even go out to speak to them people begin to have dreams of the truth hallelujah hallelujah you know I went to I was preaching in a certain place in Zimbabwe in and uh when I entered the Tabernacle the Lord had showed me these brothers uh they're having challenges amen and uh in my preaching the Holy Spirit spoke spoke it's not about the crus you've been trying to do or the evangelism no no no no no remember in the Bible days they never even had used to have big speakers put forth and some big screens it was a very humble way I think those who know brother jofrey see what God is doing in by one man oh that's how God works God works in Simplicity the Elder spoke about the Gideon part how G went with a big army so we going to fight today very big army but God is not in big numbers he said Chase others perhaps you think you think it's because we were energetic brother that was a very PA war did you see how jendes did it jendes jendes just did this to that guy and he fell down and he came B also H that giant it was not in numbers why because in this Plan of Redemption he has issued out Angels brother Hallelujah they that are with us are more than our enemies yet you can never see them with your eyes in the plan of God in Saving man it's Angel visitations but you cannot just see them hallelujah hallelujah and when brother jofrey stands there to preach the only thing people can see is one man but let me tell you something Elisha said when G's eyes were open saw thousands of Chariots round about Elisha it was God hiding himself in Simplicity and when we reach out there brother in simplicity you see that God will do greater things hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah God can speak to the hearts of the people amen I remember one day I gave this I give this testimony somewhere else there was a young Minister he had this weakness and he prayed for many many many sometime almost maybe in two years and this weakness was not leaving him he was prayed for by different preachers but he used to follow me on social media Facebook here in Uganda you don't usually use Facebook back in our place Facebook is a thing and used to follow on social media and he could he he saw what the Lord was doing and he had a desire that we can meet one day but there was no time to meet and one night he was asleep and as he was sleeping he went into this dream he was in a meeting I was preaching and the spirit of the Lord came down and began to move among his people telling them their problem that was in the dream and then he was standing somewhere then he says brother in himself within his heart he says I also have this problem I'm sure it's the best time for me to be saved from this weakness and while he was speaking within himself the Holy Spirit called him out and in the dream I hugged him I hugged him and the spirit left him amen was in a dream the simplic of God God is so simple that he himself delivers his people it's maybe that night I even seed a lot who knows maybe that same night I sinned a lot but God was determined to save someone but he must use a body to speak to the person and God use any way possible to deliver you brother hallelujah hallelujah and when he woke up he remembered it was so real in the dream and that's how the brother was set free so God can visit you but you must know how God visits his he visits them in simplic was a brother who was sick this the same testimony I wonder why I've repeated them but this another one there was another brother who was seeking the hospital in a very bad shap amen and we prayed brother prayed and prayed but the first time I prayed for him the Lord showed me that this brother will be well and you go and preach but the disease continued and many many pastors around prayed for him including myself and whenever I visit him the Holy Spirit would always tell me he'll be fine but physically speaking uh he was not fine and now there was a day when the lord gave him a trans and in that trans here you saw brother Titus coming brother Titus was coming myself of course sorry to you of course I was trying to show him that it was you know I'm brother Titus amen and when I entered where was there was something that was bothering the brother and in the dream there was designment go home the same morning the Lord spoke to him that's a day he was discharged from the hospital let me tell you something the brother was very sick and even if he came out of the hospital he had alers right but within I don't know if it's two days or has disappeared and that same week he was invited in another SE to preach when God speaks to us he can come in Simplicity I realize one thing it's not by our power our mighty but it is by the spirit of God when the Lord is speaking to us I used to wonder why he was brother b a simple speaker you speak just speak like this I said brother you know like you have to preach it out and the Lord Jesus Christ used to be a very simple speaker you just speak like this and the Bible say you take a seat you even SE and begin to speak but as he speaking there was so much power hallelujah hallelujah let me the power is not how loud our voices can Authority behind the word hallelujah hallelujah one day uh I think almost I'm finishing my now I'm doing healing now this is now healing yeah I've preached I told I don't know how to speak so in my preaching I can say this but then it's healing because if ever you had housers when you go home just check around you find that are no more that's how simple our God is amen we are not uh denominations we are the bride of Christ and we just know exactly where we are standing hallelujah hallelujah whatever you may be going through let me tell you something it was for the glory of God God wanted to manifest his glory that's why he created this created Satan an enemy nothing is out of place brother for The Wonder of singing nothing is out of place all things are in order even the sickness you facing is for the glory of God hallelujah hallelu you know brother jofrey testified yesterday had an overnight I I've just used that example when I said it's for the glory of God there something they were talking about how you know way could be hard and they develop this complication that complication and then after talking about such things then he developed he started feeling what he used to feel it's like he called the spirits back he began was it so exact brother jofrey yes sir he be to feel what he used to feel but you see God wanted to prove something that's why you had to cause him to feel that way amen and others we having backaches some stomach problems you see why would God allow such in order for him to show his power all in his story it's all in his great Plan of Redemption hallelujah hallelujah and you know during the preaching of the word like this they never realized until the service was done all those who were sick they realize they are no longer sick hallelujah hallelujah why because God wanted to be that way amen you need to have a testimony but there can never be a testimony without a test so a test will produce a testimony hallelujah hallelujah this message the evening time message shall not produce a message this message do not produce a message this shall not be a m Edge but it shall be a golden Edge because the people understand the simplicit of God that is not in our Mighty how powerful we are but it is in the humility of his word why because it's God's plan to redeem man whe I say I don't want whether I say I don't brother God predestined me he predestined you you are just a dust and he anointed this dust for this hour whether you run away God do not replace you are irreplaceable hallelujah hallelujah there's a purpose over your life amen and in this Plan of Redemption God has sent a Ministry to redeem us back to the image again and we are working in that way brother nothing is out of place all things are in place hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how many can say we are the Born Again bride [Applause] amen you must take the strength put your strength away put your words away put your thinking away and let him the Holy Ghost have preeminence over you this is the agenda he had at the beginning our Prophet teaches in the message the threefold mystery I mean the Christ and mystery of God revealed he said he has a three-fold purpose that he wanted to achieve amen he wanted to have prominance over you not just having prominance on Jesus but he wanted to have prominance even on you this great meis the great God who appeared in the in the times of abah it was not enough for him to be in MEC hallelujah hallelujah we know that was the Lord Jesus Christ in the in in the in the Old Testament amen that's why he came now had no father had not beginning he had no decent he was eternal and being Eternal he could not die but he he had to come in the form of eternal to give an eternal promise Hallelujah and he gave that promise to Abraham say Abraham I'll visit you even according to the time of life I believe it's a compound brother that's why in this evening time we had a visitation according to the time of life 28th of February 1963 about 30 minutes about 30 minutes not 30 minutes but about 30 minutes on [Music] 28 according to the time of life God has visited the Royal seity of Abraham that's why we are not defeated oh praise God brother we are not a defeated people this is Shalom to the bride Shalom to the seity of Abraham this is the home goinging time hallelujah hallelujah shall shall the bride have a Ministry shall the bride have a Ministry yes the ministry of the Bride is going on that it is such a humble Ministry and it is bypassing the noral people it is by passing the prence It Is by passing the wise men they want to see the Philips of this day to be great men with billions of [Applause] following yet God in Simplicity is moving praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah the people ask we thought there should be a rupture but they realize the Rapture had gone already because God was working in Simplicity do not look for God in bigger things God does not do in bigger ways in bigger theological ways he dos in simple ways that even a baby will be able to understand hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah brother God has his own people that God called me such humble people when you look at the life of our Prophet it was designed in such a way that God made him a simple man Oh my he was a simple man Jesus was a simple man to the exent when they about to to arrest him they didn't even know who he was Judas had to introduce him to the Dying World oh I like that one say the one kiss is the one yet the go of Heaven on Earth they never knew him the way we want to be known always in Simplicity because we want to be popular that's why we miss the will of God because we want to have a large following that's we miss the will of God each one of us brother there's a Destin that awaits for us amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah I don't want to be like amen I wish I would be like Jesus but I don't want to be like Jesus amen because Jesus of nazare had a different purpose from mine that's a that's a PE a bitter PE I mean I've never come to die physic myself in Uganda amen I've come just to preach to die him we came to die that's why you had to go through things that are related to that amen he did what was alloted for him and in these last days the bride of Christ is doing the last part that he didn't do uhhuh so if I if I be him if by going 2,000 years ago and be that one how will I be this one today that's why I must be this one for me to manifest that one hallelujah hallelujah you work in your purpose God is so simple that's why we miss God because when we walk in our purpose it is no longer our ways his ways let a man let every word of any man be a lie but his word be true amen when you are out there you see things to be I want them to be like that that must be like that that must be like that that must when you get there it's like politicians when a politician is not ruling you have some good good good suggestions sayh you know what if you did this and that it have come out this you are making a plan on a very well TI Road a very t Road you know these T roads these roads the well constructed roads that's your plan it can only be implemented on a t Road but life is not as thir as we see things life is mous and when you get in power you realize that you just had theories too many theories this message is not about the no no no no because you meet a sinner amen that's we have to respect one another Amen to have reverence for one another hallelujah our ways is not God's ways that's why we must be willing to let go of our own ways for us to manifest the will of God Moses had to let go of everything he Le in 40 years for you to carry out the will of God Amen I told you I had to let go not that I wanted is how I used to enjoy those moments because I'll be up and down here brother and those poopies that are not structured I used to break and I feel that's the power of the Holy Ghost interpret brother you have you got I was saying I used to break poppets and when people are saying Hallelujah ah I used to feel like now we are preaching man we are now preaching brother oh brother God is so simple then he brought me in my purpose oh that left me he made me very weak a very weak speaker that you can even do and that's the time now you made me move from Nation to Nation they don't understand God but Lord why how I wish this this traveling came when I was like that you don't know that rain season strange in Zambia it's no longer rain season forgive me you know little did I know maybe was the fness I had that prohibited me from traveling because then then I wish to be traveling when I started I mean it doesn't bother me even if you know it doesn't you know I don't know to explain it but you see one thing you just know that you walk in the will of God the strength of God is not laying in how loud one can be the strength of God is Not Meant in how loud one can be if you all loud is very good and if I'm not loud very good but let me make sure that this is the will of God for my life because this Redemption plan is not Cared by men but those men must be filled by the purpose of God in order to dress the bride of Christ hallelujah hallelujah do you remember the stories of those people Pentecostal who met our prophet those men tears B says when he saw brother Bram when when he saw brother bam just few minutes when he met brother bam for the first time they saw a little man on the platform and Bor had a vision [Music] he saw Jesus Christ and he says the preacher was just a simple preacher and after he was done preaching thousands came to the Lord simple but powerful and the powerfulness is not laying in how loud my voice can be is how much I aligned my will into his amen you don't have even to force God to use you he's the one who is actually having a battle with the devil I mean is the guy who is going to lose if it means losing you didn't know it you just joined actually see forces his somewh saying you can actually take my children also you also my children but he said no it's not like that some saying ah thank you Lord for healing me from today I will follow you wherever you go go with you then he said my brother my brother just go and help your father and there are disciples who are saying father Lord can I go and bu my father I bu my father said no no no no you so you can never Force God to speak to you in a way you want to he has a plan done over your life when our Prophet came was a simple man he took those who had eyes of the spirit to know what that man car the same Lord Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever more if you want to see him physically you miss him he dwells in s Simplicity hallelujah hallelujah and when the sick people came before the blind eyes they were opening just a simple prayer and B was saying I was waiting for us brother to fire up the place I'm sure he prepared some good TS there some special Tong special Tong you know to tackle the devil but when the man came oh just a weak simple prayer oh the child is heed praise the Lord and was waiting this is how simple our God is it's not even in fasting it's not even praying 24 hours how are you going to leave if you just praying throughout you see it's in Simplicity is to know what God requires of us in this time God has called us to call out a bride andever he sent he equip that man amen you can't be given even when you're building a house it also matters what kind of a building you building for certain equipments now you want to be given even some special drones you know those to small small my drones we use them a lot you want to I mean you're just building a toilet you want that thing brother you want some big vehicles but you're just building a toilet and you some big big manifestations just God has just sent you maybe to two people everything is economical God has already planned and he has equipped you just trust the Lord hello trust the Lord amen I remember one time just on the simplic of God there was a sister uh she was a Believer but you know she used to she was born in a m Church grew up in a very big good church but she used to put on trousers and she she saw that to be nothing wrong but you know she had many problems and she was prayed for by different men of God seems the the rate at which it wanted to move it was not moving at that one of the Pastors in Zambia said you can go to brother Titus so when she came I didn't know she was a Believer because she was putting on a trousers she was even a color you know I said you can't expect to be a believer I'm closing these are some of the people just want help you see there's a certain level of love that God gives his people you know I don't like judging them I don't even judge pcal people because if you judge them how you going to help them if you Ric them how you going to save them so I all Try by means to apply love so I took her and then I don't know I forgotten the conversation how we found out she was a Believer I forgotten I didn't know now to come out to ask about the trousers I didn't know don't want to sound like I'm judging her and that's a difference someone will say why can't you just tell her even if should no you not win a soul like that soul is worn by love and not John the Baptist no John the Baptist just preached it blank bullet those guys were preaching to people who they even knew these on shouldn't believe he was even saying why have you come know the people are preaching people must be saved Hallelujah John the Baptist that's why John the Baptist died early of course we know it was in his purpose two people cannot DW at the same time man decrease God increase what am I trying to tell you love can help amen and I I spoke to her I said sister one day my cousin was involved in satanism my cousin the younger the last born in my mother's family now the daughter was involved in Satanism like Satanism sat is anyone who sat who is of sat is saturnist but there are those special who know like they prophets in the kingdom of darkness they move in the spiritual world and then they called me to pray for her now after we we prayed and the Lord helped her there's one spirit that remained now I was telling a testimony it was called the religious spirit that demon whenever she do something wrong that demon would tell her a child of God and she was convinced that that was God because that demon was so religious and why did he settle there so that that person shouldn't receive the Holy Ghost and we have so many religious people today say your hair must be long if you reach your hair here as a sister your hair that's a message don't cut your hair but be careful of enticing Spirits the enticing spirits that are in the spiritual realm those Spirits are very bad spirits they affect gifted people because they want people to act in a certain way they are enticing Spirits amen but they are also religious spirits that will make you too religious more than Jesus Christ they'll make you too holy than your God religious spirits that sister and you know those Spirits if it makes people they condemn anyone else a sister who has cut her hair they wouldn't want to GRE her yet even them they are condemning a fellow sinner yet they're just sinning a different sin religious Spirits God has not called us to condemn one another when we begin to see what Christ sees then we walk a different walk and I told about that spirit that was bothering my my young sister my cousin but by God's grace through designment of spirits that demon was exposed through speaking to her just said the why have you exposed me immediately my sister began to be like a bulldog was a demon but that demon was telling her to walk right with God so that she shouldn't go far to receive the Holy Ghost you can have a religious spirit a message Church you are too too much you have G to extreme of keeping long hair the devil can take you to extremes when you see someone who is not doing what you're doing God spirit is full of love and compassion when he looked upon them he was moved with compassion in the state when you meet Sinners when you meet sinners when you meet Sinners what is your approach you see young lady dressed immorally if you bu condemned to damage this non it's just because you have a lasting spirits and they tormenting you you have a lasting spirit and you being tortured by those thighs and there by preaching true love will go in the shoe of a person true love will go in the shoe of a person and sympathize with them and say how I wish they had what I had maybe they wouldn't be in this condition and with a pure love you go that way you win many people to the world hallelujah hallelujah and this is the character of Jesus Christ when the Pharisees who are hypocrites were busy condemning a sinner that woman the Hypocrites were busy condemning that lady Jesus said whosoever has not done it let him cast a stone many people are bound by Spirits that's the reason they behave the way they behave not because they want to behave that but because there's a spirit of fornication on them whe they want or not they still do it what you need is not to condemn that cast The Devil out by the word hallelujah hallelujah amen amen I'm closing just a minute you see she was a Believer but she was putting on trousers but if I went on condemning this is sin what that's why you can entirely exate the whole church including yourself andate yourself because you realize you're also going back to your sins once in a while once in a while you drift back then you excommunicate yourself when this sister had this testimony within her the devil spoke out why have you exposed me and then she was like brother Titus it was like that's when she woke up I realize it's wrong for me to put on that's how she was delivered from that Spirit by love when love is projected you can help hallelujah hallelujah it's not you for me change a God himself has a plan a plan of redeeming that but our is to love of course we I don't mean no preaching against but correction must be done in love hallelujah hallelujah am you love the Lord It's not by powery it's not even how loud I am it's the authority behind the voice the sister came on she was she was tortured for too long and not speaking to her as I was speaking to her I saw myself out of my body and I began to hear the voice of God now we became three people there amen that was me the voice of God and the sister I began to he the voice loud speak to that sister things that have been causing our problems and was I was also listening I Heard a Voice of God command the Demon I've never had such a simple but I could hear the authority behind that voice and instantly the sister for too long she got delivered hallelujah hallelujah it's not what we can do when we submit oursel to the will of God hallelujah hallelujah amen I've seen churches brother that have been having a lot of battles B the Lord has sent me to such places just a very simple message all things come back to normal why because because God has a purpose he wants to achieve a certain purpose what purpose to redeem the bride amen uh there are many quotations I had but because of time I will not be able to go through that but I wanted to encourage you there's a Ministry amen the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ is here to help the brde in order for the right to reach a certain level until the headstone amen until she will be him so thankful that the word is in the bride hallelujah hallelujah it was a simple service but it was ped with God now go home amen if you believe with your heart you are healed because he sent them his word and his word healed them hallelujah hallelujah I told you I used to be F I used to be fly fly like full when I'm preaching but the Lord changed and are people demons were manifesting people be on the floor allons are going going on but Jesus changed everything and he made me be a simple preacher for a purpose so that it can sink in your heart something that will help you along the way amen you believe it I promise you one I've seen the Lord doing things I've seen the Lord doing things and we we don't travel because of connections we travel because God has a purpose and he wants you to fulfill that purpose I'm here this morning this afternoon not because I knew the pastor no no no because God wanted to meet someone here amen and we are the body of Christ
