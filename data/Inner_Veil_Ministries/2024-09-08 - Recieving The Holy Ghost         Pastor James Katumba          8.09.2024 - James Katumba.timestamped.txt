[45:35] bar so you just keep us in
[45:37] prayers and we appreciate all the
[45:39] Brethren who are in the
[45:41] [Music]
[45:45] Army you know in the days of John when
[45:48] he was
[45:50] preaching the Bible says different
[45:52] categories of people came to him
[45:57] came to
[45:58] him and the publicans came to
[46:02] him then the sers also came to
[46:06] him the publicans
[46:09] came what shall we do and then he told
[46:12] them don't ex more than what is meant to
[46:18] be you know the people who Tak taxes can
[46:21] cheat
[46:23] you so he say don't do that when they
[46:26] said
[46:27] came that's what shall we do then he
[46:31] told them don't do violence to
[46:35] anybody don't falsely
[46:40] atuse and be content with your
[46:43] wages but when the priests
[46:46] came they didn't ask him what shall we
[46:50] do they asked him who are
[46:54] you praise the name of
[46:58] so you see the priest missed
[47:03] salvation they even asked Jesus who gave
[47:06] you that
[47:08] Authority praise the name of our Lord so
[47:11] we thank God that he has Witnesses
[47:15] everywhere amen and then I remember in
[47:18] the times of Jesus
[47:20] Christ there was a centurion
[47:29] and the Bible says he was a faithful
[47:33] man he had built a lot of
[47:37] syag you know many
[47:39] places and then he had a sodia under him
[47:42] who was
[47:44] sick and he felt he's not worthy to meet
[47:48] Christ so he sent one of the
[47:52] Jews to pray for the servant and then he
[47:55] told the Jew go tell Jesus that me I'm
[47:59] not
[48:01] worthy but Christ is under
[48:04] Authority he can command anything and
[48:08] happens and then the Lord said there is
[48:10] no great faith like
[48:13] that then in Acts chapter
[48:16] 10 there was also another
[48:20] sodia a
[48:25] centurion and then he was called
[48:28] Cornelius God-fearing
[48:30] person he would give his arms to
[48:36] people and he was praying and fasting
[48:39] about three
[48:40] days and then the angel came and
[48:43] visited praise the name of the Lord and
[48:46] then our brothers here and sister You'
[48:50] had their leftenant
[48:53] Kel majors and captains
[48:57] and they are more than a
[49:01] centurion praise the name of our so we
[49:04] are happy that God has saved
[49:07] you and you are serving him in those
[49:11] places you also send our greetings to
[49:13] the Brethren who are in those different
[49:17] places and we pray that God blesses you
[49:20] in your place of
[49:22] work and you may be witnesses to others
[49:25] also
[49:27] praise the name of our Lord our pastor
[49:29] is not around today he went to campala
[49:32] for a
[49:34] converstion there's a youth convention I
[49:36] think is
[49:39] in he's not going to
[49:42] preach but he felt he needed to
[49:45] attend but then we want also to
[49:47] appreciate those who came for the
[49:49] meetings in blang on
[49:53] Friday we appreciate that
[49:56] actually these periods have been very
[49:58] busy for all of
[50:01] us preached on Friday to
[50:07] Services yesterday was which is
[50:12] beyond preaching today I going
[50:16] TOA then I was also in C for 3
[50:20] Days on Thursday Friday and
[50:24] Saturday so you find that there a lot of
[50:27] work to
[50:28] do and that's why we need to challenge
[50:31] our young brothers and
[50:34] sisters to really be
[50:37] serious and come to the
[50:39] task praise the name of our Lord say
[50:43] that you become involved in the
[50:46] work be involved in these
[50:50] missions sometimes you know you drive a
[50:52] long distance when you're alone in the
[50:53] car
[50:57] and then now you start wondering whom
[50:58] can you move
[51:01] with praise the name of our Lord but
[51:03] these are opportunities to move with you
[51:06] that you learn what happens
[51:10] there you know such that you can be
[51:14] involved because this is how it goes
[51:18] on praise the name of so really
[51:20] encourage the young people to be
[51:23] serious don't absent yourself from ch
[51:28] praise the name of our Lord you know
[51:30] when you don't come to
[51:32] church the first
[51:34] responsibility then we find you're not
[51:38] serious so if you can't come to church
[51:40] to attend the services which are
[51:43] there then how will be involved in the
[51:46] things which take more
[51:49] commitment praise the name of our Lord
[51:52] so you need to be serious with the work
[51:53] of the Lord
[51:57] and then you see how the Lord can help
[51:59] you and then you see how God can lift

[54:21] that praise the name of
[54:24] our Amen Let Us stand up and
[54:27] take a scripture
[54:30] reading we go to John chapter
[54:39] 20 John 20 verse
[54:45] 21 up to verse
[54:52] 23 the Bible says then said Jesus to
[54:56] them again peace be unto you as my
[55:00] father has sent me even so send I
[55:17] you and when he had said this he
[55:20] breathed on them and said unto them
[55:22] receive ye the Holy Ghost
[55:32] whoever you remit they are remitted unto
[55:35] them and soever since you retain they
[55:37] are
[55:46] retained let us pray father we bless
[55:49] your holy name and thank you for the
[55:52] reading of the
[55:54] scriptures we appreciate for what you
[55:56] doing in our
[55:57] midst we give praise and honor to your
[56:00] name and now we pray Heavenly Father May
[56:04] the Holy Spirit come
[56:06] down and break to us this word of
[56:09] eternal
[56:10] life everyone of us
[56:14] individually to know in the power of
[56:16] your
[56:17] resurrection and to be certain of where
[56:20] we are
[56:21] standing bless every one of us in such a
[56:24] SP
[56:26] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:29] Christ amen you may be
[56:33] seated so I want to take some bit of
[56:37] time I don't know how long I will
[56:40] take but I request you bear with me for
[56:43] two
[56:46] hours I want to preach on the
[56:50] subject receiving the Holy
[56:54] Ghost praise the name of our Lord
[56:57] receiving the Holy
[57:00] Ghost now the Lord Jesus
[57:04] Christ the Bible
[57:06] says you know he met his
[57:11] disciples and then he breathed on
[57:14] them and said receive ye the Holy
[57:19] Ghost now in the message questions and
[57:23] answers you can go to slide number three
[57:28] there's some slides I sent brother
[57:30] Joshua if you can follow that
[57:37] up I would request you go to my notes
[57:41] and put them
[57:44] directly because we are going to have a
[57:47] lot of things to
[57:49] read so in the message questions and
[57:52] slide number three
[57:56] slide number
[57:59] three he says under questions and
[58:03] answers they were asking brother
[58:06] Bram said dear brother
[58:08] Bram what is the
[58:11] difference when Jesus breathed on the
[58:14] disciples and
[58:17] said receive ye the Holy
[58:20] Ghost and when they had to go to the
[58:23] upper room to T
[58:28] then he says it was a
[58:31] promise he gave unto them breathed on
[58:35] them his
[58:37] promise said receive ye the Holy
[58:41] Ghost it was a
[58:43] promise they went to the upper
[58:46] room to wait for the
[58:50] promise to be
[58:52] fulfilled the same thing is when we lay
[58:55] hands upon
[58:57] you to be healed then you go on about
[59:02] your
[59:06] business waiting for the promise to be
[59:10] fulfilled now so somebody was asking him
[59:14] the
[59:15] question what was that what was that
[59:18] difference you know when he breathed on
[59:21] on them receive the Holy
[59:23] Ghost and then when they were waiting in
[59:26] the upper
[59:27] room then he says it was a promise and
[59:31] then we see that in the book of Acts
[59:33] chapter
[59:35] one and then verse
[59:37] four he says I send you the promise of
[59:40] my
[59:43] father praise the name of the Lord so
[59:45] when we go to Acts chapter
[59:48] one and then verse
[59:50] four he says and being assembled
[59:54] together with them
[59:57] commanded them that they should not
[59:58] depart from
[1:00:01] Jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[1:00:04] the
[1:00:06] Father which says
[1:00:09] he you have heard of
[1:00:13] me for John truly baptized with
[1:00:17] water but you shall be baptized with the
[1:00:20] Holy
[1:00:23] Ghost not many days h
[1:00:27] so now you see that the Lord
[1:00:30] himself giving the promise of the
[1:00:34] baptism of the Holy
[1:00:36] Spirit now when we go to the Book of
[1:00:39] Luke and then we read in Luke
[1:00:44] 3 and then verse
[1:00:46] 16 John answered saying unto them
[1:00:52] all I indeed baptize you with water
[1:00:59] but
[1:01:00] one
[1:01:03] come the latet of whose shoes I am not
[1:01:07] worthy to
[1:01:11] unloose he shall baptize with the Holy
[1:01:14] Ghost with and
[1:01:17] fire so now John
[1:01:20] say what I can do is I baptize you with
[1:01:23] water
[1:01:26] and as a minister we can also do the
[1:01:29] same like our young sister winie to be
[1:01:33] baptized here on wedes day in the name
[1:01:35] of Jesus
[1:01:37] Christ any person can baptize you that
[1:01:40] way but only God who can baptize you
[1:01:45] with the Holy
[1:01:47] Spirit and being baptized with the Holy
[1:01:51] Spirit is the new
[1:01:53] birth being baptized with the holy
[1:01:56] spirit is being born from
[1:02:01] Heaven praise the name of our Lord
[1:02:03] because Jesus told
[1:02:05] Nicodemus that unless a man is born
[1:02:10] again he cannot enter into the kingdom
[1:02:13] of
[1:02:14] God and that word
[1:02:17] again you know the original translation
[1:02:21] was
[1:02:23] above in other words unless a man is
[1:02:26] born from
[1:02:29] above unless a man is born from
[1:02:33] heaven like John chapter
[1:02:36] 3 and then we can pick that up
[1:02:40] there the Bible
[1:02:42] says John chapter
[1:02:44] 3 and then we go
[1:02:48] to to
[1:02:51] verse Jesus
[1:02:53] answered very very I say unto
[1:02:56] you except a man be born of
[1:03:01] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[1:03:05] into the kingdom of
[1:03:08] God that which is born of flesh is
[1:03:13] flesh and that which is born of the
[1:03:16] spirit is
[1:03:19] Spirit Marvel not that I said unto
[1:03:23] thee you must be born
[1:03:28] again so our first
[1:03:30] birth is the birth we get from our
[1:03:35] parents our mothers our fathers gave
[1:03:39] birth to our first gave birth to this
[1:03:42] bodies praise the name of our Lord that
[1:03:45] was our first bus and our first bus
[1:03:49] comes from the first
[1:03:52] Adam praise the name of our Lord we are
[1:03:55] all descendants of
[1:03:58] Adam by the first
[1:04:00] birth but now the birth of the first
[1:04:04] bir the Bible says in Psalms chapter
[1:04:12] 51 Psalms
[1:04:15] 51 and then verse
[1:04:18] 5 it says behold I was Sheed in iniquity
[1:04:26] and in sin did my mother conceive
[1:04:31] meise the name of so our first
[1:04:36] bir the Bible
[1:04:38] says we were actually shapen in
[1:04:44] iniquity and in sin did our parents
[1:04:47] conceive
[1:04:49] us so in other words the original plan
[1:04:53] of God
[1:04:55] is not the way we come here on
[1:04:58] us our first
[1:05:01] birth makes us blind to the things of
[1:05:05] God our first makes us enemies of
[1:05:10] God like say for example you may have a
[1:05:14] little child at
[1:05:17] home and then the child goes and starts
[1:05:19] saking
[1:05:22] sugar and now when you meet the child
[1:05:25] you ask the child who has given you this
[1:05:27] sugar so I've not taken any sugar and
[1:05:30] then trying to wipe the mouth it is a
[1:05:34] nature of sin we are born
[1:05:37] with that is our first birth that's the
[1:05:40] birth from
[1:05:42] Adam and Adam was a fallen
[1:05:46] man praise the name of the Lord so he
[1:05:49] fell then he produced so he produced
[1:05:53] every
[1:05:54] person after his Fallen
[1:05:58] nature praise the name of the Lord you
[1:06:00] don't need somebody to tell you that
[1:06:02] you're going to
[1:06:03] die because death lives with
[1:06:06] you as long as you are born death
[1:06:09] follows
[1:06:12] you because that's the nature we are
[1:06:15] born
[1:06:16] with you get a little child
[1:06:19] dying when you're dying at any age
[1:06:22] somebody's dying why because of our
[1:06:26] F who were born in sin and shaped in
[1:06:31] iniquity that's why
[1:06:34] God had to put on
[1:06:37] flesh and come as the Lord Jesus
[1:06:41] Christ praise the name of our Lord you
[1:06:43] know God he manifests
[1:06:47] himself as the father as the son as the
[1:06:52] Holy Ghost the same God the Old
[1:06:56] Testament he showed himself as the
[1:06:59] father praise the name of our Lord and
[1:07:03] father God above
[1:07:05] us and now in the Old
[1:07:08] Testament you remember when he was
[1:07:10] giving the law in
[1:07:14] Exodus until it was so
[1:07:19] fearful to reach that
[1:07:22] mount he told them put boundaries
[1:07:27] around and said if the animal crosses
[1:07:30] those
[1:07:31] boundaries it should be killed and then
[1:07:35] even Moses said
[1:07:36] himself I
[1:07:39] feared that was how God was as a
[1:07:42] father but now he desire to redeem
[1:07:46] us so the only way he could redeem
[1:07:49] us was for God
[1:07:52] himself to get a body
[1:07:56] and that body he
[1:07:58] got we called it
[1:08:01] Emmanuel God With Us he was not the
[1:08:05] second God but it was the same God who
[1:08:09] was above he put on a body we called him
[1:08:13] Jesus Christ and then he was God With
[1:08:16] Us Praise the name of our Lord he was
[1:08:19] God With
[1:08:20] Us and now Jesus Christ in that body the
[1:08:25] Bible says in Hebrews
[1:08:28] 31 he was the expression of the
[1:08:31] invisible
[1:08:33] God because the invisible God is a
[1:08:37] spirit you can't touch a
[1:08:39] spirit you can't see a spirit so that
[1:08:43] Spirit of the invisible God put on a
[1:08:47] body called Jesus Christ and then he was
[1:08:51] born Among
[1:08:53] Us now you look at it this way
[1:08:56] the first law the first
[1:08:58] commandment and the second commandment
[1:09:01] says you shall not have other gods
[1:09:03] beside
[1:09:05] me and you shall not worship them but
[1:09:09] now you look at the wise
[1:09:11] men old
[1:09:13] men and then they came to
[1:09:17] bethleem and they bought
[1:09:20] down and they worshiped baby
[1:09:23] Jesus if they were contrast the
[1:09:26] law God would not have warned
[1:09:31] them to go and tell her what they have
[1:09:34] seen so you see it is God Who Came In
[1:09:37] the
[1:09:38] Flesh and dwelt amongst
[1:09:41] us praise the name of our Lord John
[1:09:44] chapter 1 and then verse 14 in the
[1:09:47] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:09:49] with God and the word became flesh that
[1:09:53] was our Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:09:56] was not the second
[1:09:58] God Jesus Christ is not the second
[1:10:02] person of the
[1:10:04] Trinity but Jesus Christ is the only
[1:10:07] person of
[1:10:09] God praise the name of Lord he was the
[1:10:13] manifestation of the Living God but now
[1:10:17] Jesus in his form here on
[1:10:20] us he says it's better for me that I go
[1:10:26] away but when I go away I will send you
[1:10:30] a
[1:10:31] comforter praise the name of the spirit
[1:10:35] of Truth let us go to John chapter
[1:10:39] 14 praise the name of our Lord John
[1:10:43] chapter
[1:10:44] 14 and then we start from verse
[1:10:48] 16 it says and I will pray the father
[1:10:52] and he shall give you another comforter
[1:10:55] that that he may abide with you
[1:11:04] forever even the spirit of
[1:11:07] Truth whom the world cannot
[1:11:11] receive because it sees him
[1:11:14] not neither knows
[1:11:16] him but you know him for he dwelleth
[1:11:21] with
[1:11:22] you and shall be in you
[1:11:26] so he says God is the father is going to
[1:11:28] send another
[1:11:30] comforter what was he meaning I'm coming
[1:11:33] in another
[1:11:35] form and the comforter is talking about
[1:11:40] is the spirit of
[1:11:42] Truth in other words the spirit of God
[1:11:47] the spirit of Christ the Holy Spirit the
[1:11:51] Holy Ghost it is the same thing and then
[1:11:55] he says he dwells with
[1:11:58] you who was with them it was Christ so
[1:12:02] he says now I'm going to put off this
[1:12:06] body and then come in the form of the
[1:12:09] Holy
[1:12:10] Spirit and then he says the world cannot
[1:12:14] receive him the world cannot see him and
[1:12:19] the world cannot know
[1:12:20] him now what is that
[1:12:23] world which cannot receive the Holy
[1:12:27] Spirit which cannot see the Holy
[1:12:30] Spirit which cannot know the Holy
[1:12:33] Spirit when we got to the book of First
[1:12:37] John praise the name of our Lord first
[1:12:40] John chapter
[1:12:42] 2 and then we start from
[1:12:45] verse
[1:12:48] 15 the scripture says love not the
[1:12:53] world neither the things that are in the
[1:12:56] world if any man love the world the love
[1:13:01] of the father is not in him 1 John 2
[1:13:05] verse
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:18] 15 praise the name of our Lord so he
[1:13:21] says love not the
[1:13:23] world nether the things that are in the
[1:13:28] world if any man love the
[1:13:31] world the love of the father is not in
[1:13:35] him then he explains the world is
[1:13:38] talking
[1:13:40] about for all the
[1:13:43] world for all that is in the
[1:13:46] world then he names it the lust of the
[1:13:50] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[1:13:53] of life is not of the
[1:13:57] father but is of the
[1:14:01] world so now if you have the lust of the
[1:14:04] flesh you have the lust of the ey you
[1:14:08] have the pride of
[1:14:09] life that is the world and he says that
[1:14:13] world you
[1:14:14] have the last of the flesh the last of
[1:14:18] the eye the pride of life cannot receive
[1:14:22] the holy
[1:14:23] spirit that one you have cannot see the
[1:14:27] holy spirit that world you have cannot
[1:14:31] know the holy spirit so now if we want
[1:14:33] to receive the Holy
[1:14:35] Spirit then we need to get rid of that
[1:14:40] world the lust of the
[1:14:42] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[1:14:46] of life so if you don't get R of that
[1:14:50] word you cannot receive the true baptism
[1:14:53] of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:56] praise the name of our Lord because we
[1:14:57] are talking about being born
[1:15:00] again and being born again is receiving
[1:15:04] the holy spirit from God himself being
[1:15:08] born again is receiving the life of
[1:15:11] Jesus
[1:15:12] Christ praise the name of our Lord
[1:15:15] receiving the life of Jesus Christ is
[1:15:18] being born again is being born of God is
[1:15:23] the new birth
[1:15:25] becoming a new
[1:15:28] creation praise the name of our Lord so
[1:15:30] now the Lord Jesus told them unless I go
[1:15:35] away if I don't go away the comforter
[1:15:39] will not come praise the name of our
[1:15:42] Lord it says he will not come so when we
[1:15:45] go to John chapter
[1:15:47] 7 and then verse
[1:15:50] 37 praise the name of our Lord today I'm
[1:15:54] going to be quite
[1:15:56] faster praise the name of our Lord
[1:15:59] because I have a
[1:16:00] lot which I feel we need to reach
[1:16:04] to praise the name of our Lord I want
[1:16:07] you to
[1:16:09] adjust praise the name of Lord we shall
[1:16:12] be moving in different
[1:16:15] direction so John 7 verse
[1:16:19] 37 in the last day that great day of the
[1:16:23] feast
[1:16:28] Jesus stood and cried
[1:16:32] saying in a man
[1:16:35] thirst let him come unto
[1:16:38] me and
[1:16:40] drink and he that believeth on
[1:16:43] me as the scripture has
[1:16:46] said out of his
[1:16:50] belly shall flow rivers of Living Water
[1:16:57] and then the scripture says in verse
[1:17:00] 39 but this spoke he of the
[1:17:05] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:17:08] should
[1:17:11] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:17:16] given because that Jesus was not yet
[1:17:21] glorified so you see that the Holy
[1:17:23] Spirit
[1:17:25] was given after Christ was
[1:17:29] glorified the Holy Spirit had to come
[1:17:32] down to
[1:17:34] us after the
[1:17:37] death burial and resurrection of Jesus
[1:17:41] Christ praise the name of the Lord
[1:17:44] that's where the Holy Ghost had to come
[1:17:46] to
[1:17:47] us and you know that in the
[1:17:50] scriptures the Bible says they saw that
[1:17:53] sinness
[1:17:55] shall die but now God didn't leave us in
[1:18:00] that kind of
[1:18:01] condition so he put there an
[1:18:05] atonement in lus chter
[1:18:09] 17 and then verse
[1:18:12] 11 praise the name of our Lord so the
[1:18:15] Bible says in Leviticus
[1:18:23] 1711 for the of the flesh is in in the
[1:18:26] blood and I have given it unto you upon
[1:18:30] the altar to make an atonment for your
[1:18:33] souls for it is the blood that makes an
[1:18:36] atonement for the
[1:18:51] soul praise the name of the Lord now I
[1:18:54] want you to go to the church I gave
[1:18:57] you the
[1:18:59] slides praise the name of the Lord I
[1:19:02] want to go to slide number
[1:19:05] 26 praise the name of the Lord so now in
[1:19:10] luganda the
[1:19:12] soul is calling
[1:19:16] it but the
[1:19:20] soul okay okay you've got it right let
[1:19:24] us go to first Thessalonians chapter
[1:19:30] 5 we going to come back to lus chapter
[1:19:34] 17 I want to use the scriptures to
[1:19:37] explain
[1:19:40] scriptures now first Thessalonians
[1:19:43] chapter
[1:19:47] 5 and then verse
[1:19:50] 23 he says and the Very God of Peace
[1:19:56] sanctify you holy and I pray that God
[1:19:59] your whole spirit and soul and body be
[1:20:04] preserved blameless un the coming of our
[1:20:08] Lord Jesus
[1:20:09] Christ
[1:20:13] 5 Leviticus 5:
[1:20:19] 23 23
[1:20:43] now in first Thessalonians 5 verse
[1:20:49] 23 show that
[1:20:51] scripture praise the name of our Lord
[1:20:54] today I want the people controlling to
[1:20:57] be FAS I'm
[1:21:00] fast first Thessalonians chapter 5 and
[1:21:04] then verse
[1:21:07] 23 now so you see here the Bible says
[1:21:11] and I pray that your whole
[1:21:16] Spirit that's now the human
[1:21:19] spirit and then he says the
[1:21:21] soul and then the body so as a human
[1:21:25] being you have the
[1:21:28] body praise the name of our Lord then
[1:21:31] inside the body there is the human
[1:21:35] spirit and then inside the human Spirit
[1:21:39] there is the
[1:21:40] soul praise the name of our Lord there
[1:21:43] is the
[1:21:44] soul praise the name of our Lord you
[1:21:47] know the devil doesn't want us to follow
[1:21:51] this praise the name of our Lord now
[1:21:55] I want to demonstrate
[1:21:58] it praise the name of the
[1:22:04] Lord I want you to follow
[1:22:06] me what is
[1:22:09] this you respond you know to be saved to
[1:22:14] be
[1:22:15] saved you have to
[1:22:17] confess I want you to
[1:22:19] confess so what is this who hand
[1:22:25] you raise also your
[1:22:26] hand so what is this who
[1:22:30] hand what is this whose
[1:22:34] head what is
[1:22:36] this whose
[1:22:39] hand so what is this whose head what is
[1:22:44] this whose hand so where are you
[1:22:54] praise the name of the Lord because if I
[1:22:57] say what is
[1:22:58] this phone whose phone mine then I say
[1:23:03] what is this hand whose hand so where
[1:23:07] are you are you the
[1:23:10] hand are you the head or are you the
[1:23:16] body praise the name of Lord so this
[1:23:19] body here is like a
[1:23:22] house you yourself are inside
[1:23:27] that praise the name of our Lord so when
[1:23:30] you die they said the B of so and
[1:23:33] so you have already
[1:23:37] left so now the Bible is telling us that
[1:23:41] may God
[1:23:43] sanctify your whole
[1:23:46] body which our parents gave birth
[1:23:49] to but the parents giving birth to the
[1:23:52] body
[1:23:54] is not a whole human
[1:23:56] being because others give birth to
[1:23:59] bodies and still
[1:24:06] birth so at the
[1:24:09] birth God releases the human
[1:24:13] Spirit and the human spirit is the one
[1:24:16] that gives this body
[1:24:19] life the one the Bible says the body
[1:24:23] without the spirit
[1:24:25] is dead so we have these bodies but
[1:24:29] there is a human
[1:24:32] spirit that moves this
[1:24:35] body but then in that human
[1:24:38] Spirit there is a
[1:24:40] soul and that soul is what God is
[1:24:44] interested
[1:24:46] in but then he's saying let God sanctify
[1:24:50] your whole
[1:24:51] body your whole spirit
[1:24:55] and your whole
[1:24:56] soul praise the name of our Lord but
[1:24:59] then in the
[1:25:03] scriptures let us go to
[1:25:06] Genesis praise the name of our Lord we
[1:25:09] go to
[1:25:11] Genesis and then we read in chapter
[1:25:18] two Genesis chapter 2
[1:25:21] and and then we read in verse 7
[1:25:27] and the Lord formed man of the Dust of
[1:25:30] the ground and breathed into him his
[1:25:32] noes the breath of life and Man became a
[1:25:35] living
[1:25:49] Soul so he saying a living soul
[1:25:54] praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:25:56] when we go to Ezekiel chapter
[1:26:01] 18 and then verse
[1:26:04] 20 the scripture
[1:26:06] says the soul that
[1:26:10] sinth it shall
[1:26:13] die the son shall not bear the iniquity
[1:26:16] of the
[1:26:19] father neither shall the father bear the
[1:26:22] iniquity of the son
[1:26:26] the righteous of the righteous shall be
[1:26:29] upon
[1:26:31] him and the wickedness of the wicked
[1:26:34] shall be upon
[1:26:36] him now he says the soul that
[1:26:40] sin now it is the
[1:26:43] soul that God is more interested
[1:26:48] in praise the name of our Lord it is the
[1:26:51] soul which is the source of life
[1:26:55] that's where God's interest
[1:26:58] is that's why God can make this body
[1:27:05] suffer for the Salvation of the
[1:27:08] Soul because that is his
[1:27:11] interest God can take this body away
[1:27:14] from
[1:27:18] us or
[1:27:21] die because of the Soul that is the
[1:27:25] interest of
[1:27:26] God not so much how the body is feeling
[1:27:29] good not so much how the body is
[1:27:33] looking not so much how the body has
[1:27:35] achieved this and this but it is the
[1:27:39] soul which is the interest of
[1:27:41] God now when we go back to Leviticus
[1:27:46] 17 and then verse
[1:27:48] 11 the Bible says for the life of the
[1:27:52] flesh is in the
[1:27:56] blood and have given it un you upon the
[1:28:00] altar to make an atonement for your
[1:28:04] soul for it is the
[1:28:06] blood that makes an
[1:28:10] atonement the soul is not talking about
[1:28:13] atonement for the
[1:28:15] body he not talking about the atonement
[1:28:18] of the
[1:28:19] spirit but he talking about the
[1:28:21] atonement of the Soul
[1:28:25] because that's where sin came
[1:28:28] from and it is in the
[1:28:30] S where sin
[1:28:33] lays it is in the soul where unbelief
[1:28:37] lays so now God had to bring an
[1:28:40] atonment to see that sin in the
[1:28:44] soul is gotten rid of and then he says I
[1:28:49] have put blood upon the
[1:28:51] altar to make an atonement for
[1:28:55] praise the name of our living so now he
[1:28:58] says the life of the
[1:29:01] body the life of the
[1:29:03] flesh is in the
[1:29:05] blood that's why Jesus Christ had to
[1:29:09] come in this
[1:29:10] body that's why Jesus Christ had to get
[1:29:14] a human
[1:29:15] body because it is the human
[1:29:18] body that could produce
[1:29:21] blood and now the blood of Jesus
[1:29:25] made
[1:29:27] atonment for our
[1:29:29] souls praise the name of our Lord and
[1:29:31] you know like somebody when they get an
[1:29:34] accident they have to rush them to the
[1:29:37] hospital or to make them stop
[1:29:41] bleeding otherwise if they bleed and the
[1:29:43] blood is
[1:29:44] over they die why because life of the
[1:29:49] flesh is in the blood so now he uses the
[1:29:54] the blood of animals in the Old
[1:29:57] Testament to make
[1:29:59] atonement but now the blood of the
[1:30:03] animals will not re remove the human
[1:30:06] life the human
[1:30:08] s because animal
[1:30:11] life could not come to human
[1:30:14] life animal life is lower than human
[1:30:18] life so now God himself had to put on a
[1:30:24] body and when he put on a body he came
[1:30:27] and shed his own
[1:30:29] blood praise the name of our Lord no
[1:30:32] wonder what the Bible says in Acts
[1:30:36] 20 and then verse
[1:30:38] 28 the Bible says take heed therefore to
[1:30:43] yourselves and to all the flock over
[1:30:46] which the Holy Ghost has made you
[1:30:48] overseers
[1:30:58] to feed the Church of
[1:31:02] God which he has purchased with his own
[1:31:07] blood so the Bible says we are
[1:31:11] purchased by the blood of
[1:31:14] God we are not
[1:31:16] purchased by the blood of a
[1:31:19] Jew we are not purchased by the blood of
[1:31:23] a person
[1:31:24] but we are purchased by the blood of God
[1:31:28] himself and so the blood of
[1:31:31] God had
[1:31:33] life what was the life in the blood of
[1:31:36] God the Holy Spirit praise the name of
[1:31:40] our Lord so the Holy Spirit was the
[1:31:44] life in the blood of Jesus Christ the
[1:31:48] Holy Spirit was the life in the blood of
[1:31:52] God
[1:31:54] so now when he
[1:31:56] died he released that
[1:31:58] life praise the name of our Lord so now
[1:32:01] in John
[1:32:04] 7 and verse
[1:32:07] 39 the Bible
[1:32:10] says but this Spokey of the
[1:32:15] spirit which they that believe on
[1:32:20] him should receive
[1:32:24] for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:32:28] given because that Jesus was not yet
[1:32:33] gr praise the name of our Lord so now
[1:32:36] when Jesus died that's when he released
[1:32:40] his
[1:32:41] life that's when he released the holy
[1:32:44] spirit so then on the day of
[1:32:46] Pentecost the life of Jesus Christ which
[1:32:50] is the holy spirit comes down to the
[1:32:53] church
[1:32:54] comes down to the
[1:32:56] Believers praise the name of our Lord so
[1:32:58] he
[1:33:00] says they he spoke of the Holy
[1:33:04] Spirit which they that believe on
[1:33:08] him should
[1:33:10] receive now the thing is when Jesus died
[1:33:14] he released the Holy
[1:33:16] Spirit praise the name of our like if he
[1:33:19] says I've given you
[1:33:24] praise the name of the Lord like if I
[1:33:26] come and give brother cus the
[1:33:29] phone what does he
[1:33:32] do what do you
[1:33:36] do now this one is interesting he starts
[1:33:39] pressing it with
[1:33:41] me it doesn't instead receive it or take
[1:33:44] it so when they give
[1:33:47] you what do you do you
[1:33:51] receive praise the name of our Lord you
[1:33:54] receive what is given to
[1:33:56] you now he has said receive you the Holy
[1:34:00] Ghost do you
[1:34:02] do you
[1:34:04] receive now the question is why don't
[1:34:07] you
[1:34:09] receive praise the name of the Lord why
[1:34:12] don't you
[1:34:13] receive so you get somebody telling you
[1:34:17] I spent 10 years without the Holy
[1:34:20] Ghost then you start asking them what's
[1:34:23] wrong with you
[1:34:24] what did you
[1:34:27] believe I've waited for the Holy Ghost
[1:34:29] the whole
[1:34:31] year when the Holy Ghost has already
[1:34:33] been
[1:34:35] given and for you are saying you have
[1:34:37] taken year without
[1:34:39] receiving what's wrong with your
[1:34:43] faith praise the name of our
[1:34:46] Lord now when he said
[1:34:50] receive on the day of Pentecost he
[1:34:54] gave and when he gives what do you do
[1:34:58] you
[1:35:00] take praise the name of our Lord then I
[1:35:03] want to ask this who of us is
[1:35:07] here and you have asked God to give you
[1:35:11] something who of us
[1:35:14] here that God has never answered their
[1:35:19] prayers praise the name of our Lord who
[1:35:21] of us is here I desire this thing of God
[1:35:25] and God has never answered me
[1:35:28] this who of us is here and you can say
[1:35:33] ah I asked him for this and he
[1:35:36] never I've waited many years and doesn't
[1:35:40] give it to me who of us can say
[1:35:42] that and then how can you say you asked
[1:35:46] God to give you the
[1:35:48] H and he has not
[1:35:50] given how can you say that when God's
[1:35:55] interest what brought Christ on the
[1:35:57] cross is to die for you that you may
[1:36:00] receive his life and then you say I've
[1:36:04] taken years without receiving the Holy
[1:36:07] Ghost what are you up to Why did you get
[1:36:11] saved
[1:36:14] why because to get saved means that I
[1:36:18] want his life in
[1:36:20] me and he has promised that I send you
[1:36:24] the promise of my
[1:36:26] father and he said wait for a few
[1:36:30] days and on the day of
[1:36:33] Pentecost the Holy Ghost came

[1:38:46] face praise the name of the Lord the
[1:38:49] Bible is saying in verse
[1:38:51] six that s
[1:38:55] not now this is what you're saying in
[1:38:57] your
[1:38:59] heart who shall go to

[1:39:06] Christ because you knew he went to
[1:39:08] heaven and you think he's still in

[1:39:31] lazy
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:34] ghost where is your
[1:39:37] face until there was a
[1:39:40] brother who was falsely encouraging
[1:39:51] others you know if you don't make it in
[1:39:53] the
[1:39:55] Rapture will be there the foolish the
[1:39:58] foolish
[1:39:59] vir this message is not for the foolish
[1:40:04] virgins praise the name of our Lord this
[1:40:07] message is for the wise
[1:40:10] virgins why God has given us a message
[1:40:14] is to have the life of Jesus
[1:40:16] CHR praise the name of our Lord that's
[1:40:19] the
[1:40:20] purpose believe the word of Gody the
[1:40:23] word of God and the Holy Ghost
[1:40:26] comes now he says who shall bring up
[1:40:31] Christ Christ is not talking about Jesus
[1:40:36] but saying Christ and what is Christ the
[1:40:40] Holy
[1:40:41] Spirit he says don't say who bring the
[1:40:45] holy ghost from Heaven who bring the
[1:40:47] holy ghost from
[1:40:49] H
[1:40:51] verse but what says
[1:40:54] it the word is near
[1:40:58] thee how near is the word to
[1:41:01] you he explains in your
[1:41:04] mouth in your
[1:41:06] heart do you have a mouth how far is
[1:41:09] your mouth from
[1:41:11] you do you have a heart how far is your
[1:41:15] heart from
[1:41:16] you so what you need is that word to
[1:41:21] settle in your heart Holy Ghost
[1:41:25] comes praise the name of our Lord that's
[1:41:27] all you
[1:41:28] need the Bible says he gives the Holy
[1:41:32] Spirit to them that
[1:41:35] believe the question is are you a
[1:41:39] Believer or
[1:41:41] not praise the name of the Lord let us
[1:41:44] go to acts
[1:41:50] 5:32 acts 5:32
[1:41:55] and we are his
[1:42:00] Witnesses of these things and so is also
[1:42:04] the Holy
[1:42:06] Ghost whom God has
[1:42:09] given to them that obey
[1:42:13] him very
[1:42:15] simple who receives the Holy
[1:42:17] Ghost does that obey now what is wrong
[1:42:21] with you not to obey
[1:42:27] what
[1:42:28] your word then why did you confess
[1:42:33] Jesus don't want to word it's just as
[1:42:37] simple as
[1:42:38] that then somebody says I've taken a h
[1:42:41] year I'm looking for the Holy Ghost I
[1:42:43] don't know you don't know what you are
[1:42:45] looking
[1:42:46] for that's the whole
[1:42:49] thing praise the name of our Lord you
[1:42:51] don't know what you're looking for
[1:42:55] so you are going this way then again the
[1:42:58] other one tells you when I Reed the Holy
[1:43:01] Ghost the light came on the
[1:43:04] wall then I started roaring
[1:43:07] around you're not looking for the Holy
[1:43:09] Ghost you were looking for roaring
[1:43:13] around praise the name of when I got the
[1:43:16] Holy Ghost jumped up and
[1:43:19] down so you're also looking for jumping
[1:43:21] up and
[1:43:24] you're not looking for the Holy
[1:43:26] Ghost me when the Holy Ghost
[1:43:29] came felt a lot of energy I felt
[1:43:33] something burning in my
[1:43:36] heart that's what you're looking for
[1:43:39] you're not looking for the Holy
[1:43:41] Ghost the holy spirit is the life of
[1:43:45] Jesus Christ praise the name of Lord now
[1:43:49] we have where Satan has tricked us
[1:43:54] to look for
[1:43:56] emotions for the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:59] Spirit and that is
[1:44:02] deceptive when you look at the baptism
[1:44:05] of the holy
[1:44:07] spirit in the
[1:44:09] scriptures the emotions were not the
[1:44:14] same and the things which happened were
[1:44:17] not the
[1:44:20] same so now if you are looking for
[1:44:25] you may get the
[1:44:26] emotion without the Holy
[1:44:29] Ghost and then you
[1:44:37] start
[1:44:39] CH but he
[1:44:45] fa what you call the spirit was not the
[1:44:47] Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the life
[1:44:52] of Jesus
[1:44:54] and so when you are seeking the baptism
[1:44:56] of the Holy
[1:44:58] Spirit look for the life of Jesus
[1:45:02] Christ don't look for jumping
[1:45:05] around dancing around running feeling
[1:45:09] nice or crying or doing whatever don't
[1:45:14] look for that the ho spirit is so
[1:45:21] sov you don't direct the Holy Ghost now
[1:45:25] you come and have a tongue of fire
[1:45:30] on on the day of Pentecost they receive
[1:45:33] tongues of fire but the rest of the
[1:45:36] scriptures you don't see that tongue of
[1:45:38] fire on
[1:45:39] there now when they didn't get the tong
[1:45:42] of fire you they didn't get the Holy
[1:45:46] Ghost praise the name of our Lord on the
[1:45:49] day of Pentecost there was a lot of
[1:45:51] sound
[1:45:55] you know it was a whole
[1:45:56] commotion until all the body
[1:46:00] emotions you know they felt the eyes saw
[1:46:03] the
[1:46:04] fire the ears had the
[1:46:07] noise the body felt the
[1:46:10] wind praise the name of our Lord and
[1:46:13] then the Bible says TS of fire
[1:46:18] appeared you know like when you get a
[1:46:20] candlestick
[1:46:22] [Laughter]
[1:46:27] you know and then you put it in your
[1:46:29] sitting room or
[1:46:31] outside and then the wind blows you know
[1:46:34] it is like this so that's what was on
[1:46:36] their
[1:46:38] heads it was Vis
[1:46:41] seen but in the rest of the scriptures
[1:46:45] you don't see that on their
[1:46:47] head you mean they didn't get the Holy
[1:46:50] Ghost praise the name of
[1:46:54] on the day of Pentecost there was a
[1:46:56] mighty sound from
[1:46:58] heaven and then filled where they were
[1:47:01] when you read other places it was only
[1:47:04] one place where the Bible says they
[1:47:07] received the Holy Ghost and the place
[1:47:10] shook but other places there was no
[1:47:12] shaking of the place there was no great
[1:47:15] noise
[1:47:17] around you mean they didn't get the Holy
[1:47:20] Spirit praise the name of the Lord on
[1:47:23] the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost
[1:47:25] came their tongues were
[1:47:28] quickened until they spoke with
[1:47:31] other but when you follow other places
[1:47:34] some places they never even spoke with
[1:47:36] us you mean they didn't get the
[1:47:39] Hol praise the name of the Lord in some
[1:47:43] places they prophesy in some places they
[1:47:47] didn't
[1:47:50] prophesy you mean they didn't get the
[1:47:52] Holy Ghost
[1:47:54] praise the name of our Lord let us go to
[1:47:56] Acts chapter
[1:48:00] 9 praise the name of the Lord and then
[1:48:04] verse
[1:48:11] 17 so the scripture says and ananas went
[1:48:15] his way and entered into the house and
[1:48:20] putting his hands on him said brother
[1:48:23] Soul the Lord even Jesus that appeared
[1:48:26] unto the in the way at thou as thou
[1:48:28] comest has sent me that thou might
[1:48:31] receive thy sight and be filled with the
[1:48:34] Holy Ghost
[1:49:01] sa praise the name of the Lord know he
[1:49:04] was on the
[1:49:05] road to
[1:49:08] Damascus to persecute the children of
[1:49:11] God and so as he was on the
[1:49:14] way a bright shining
[1:49:18] light and then he fell down then he
[1:49:21] heard
[1:49:23] s why do you persecute
[1:49:26] me praise the name of our Lord
[1:49:29] now was the one persecuting the children
[1:49:33] of
[1:49:34] God that they under false
[1:49:37] worship because they accepted the Lord
[1:49:40] Jesus as their
[1:49:42] personal because they said Jesus Christ
[1:49:45] is the
[1:49:46] Messiah because they said Jesus Christ
[1:49:50] is the Living God so he was saying you
[1:49:53] are wrong and killing many of
[1:49:56] them and now
[1:49:58] God praise the name of you see how the
[1:50:02] grace of God
[1:50:03] work he came in the way that Saul would
[1:50:07] understand
[1:50:09] him so he came as a pillar of
[1:50:13] fire in the Old Testament the pillar of
[1:50:17] fire was the one leading the children of
[1:50:20] Israel from Egypt to Canaan
[1:50:23] praise the name of the Lord and so it
[1:50:25] was the glory of God so he came under
[1:50:29] the same Pillar of
[1:50:32] Fire saw said this is my Lord this is
[1:50:36] the god almighty this who
[1:50:39] created said oh
[1:50:42] God who are
[1:50:44] you you know he was persecuting god
[1:50:48] without knowing that he's doing
[1:50:50] that because he was in his religious
[1:50:55] system praise the name of our Lord still
[1:50:58] saying God can never put on
[1:51:01] flesh said who are
[1:51:04] you who are you my
[1:51:06] Lord did he tell I am Jesus praise the
[1:51:11] name of our Lord so now Saul that light
[1:51:14] made him
[1:51:16] blind made him totally
[1:51:20] blind so when they took him to the sit
[1:51:23] by the
[1:51:25] hand he was praying and
[1:51:28] fasting
[1:51:30] God oh God I didn't know you were God
[1:51:33] I've done those things oh God I was
[1:51:35] pouring my
[1:51:36] father's God I was pouring
[1:51:39] my God supp he was
[1:51:44] repenting Lord forgive
[1:51:47] me he was now thinking of those things
[1:51:50] he has been doing
[1:51:53] my father's
[1:51:54] religion the soul that sin it shall die
[1:51:58] if it's the religion of your father you
[1:52:01] also need to make your personal
[1:52:05] decision when you receive the Gospel to
[1:52:08] make a personal decision so now Paul
[1:52:12] rejected the traditions of his
[1:52:15] father and he accepted the revelation of
[1:52:18] Jesus
[1:52:19] Christ so now after 3 days
[1:52:23] during the three days the Bible says
[1:52:26] this is a blind man and then Jesus
[1:52:30] Christ went and to
[1:52:33] ananas who was a
[1:52:35] prophet and then he said praise the name
[1:52:39] of the
[1:52:40] Lord there is a man called
[1:52:43] sa
[1:52:46] ofis he's
[1:52:48] praying and he has seen in a vision
[1:52:52] now you can imagine a blind man seeing a
[1:52:56] vision blind but he's seeing a
[1:52:59] visional
[1:53:01] things praise the name of our he saw a
[1:53:04] man but he was blind but the vision he
[1:53:06] say
[1:53:07] man coming and laying his
[1:53:11] hands so ananas is sent by
[1:53:14] God go and pray for
[1:53:17] sa now when ananas comes to
[1:53:21] sa tells brother
[1:53:24] saw when he was laying his hands on
[1:53:27] him the Lord
[1:53:29] Jesus appear to you in the
[1:53:32] way has sent me to do what two
[1:53:37] things that I pray for
[1:53:41] you and you do what and you receive your
[1:53:47] sight the second thing and you be filled
[1:53:50] with the Holy Spirit
[1:53:53] am that's why ananas was
[1:53:56] sent
[1:53:59] his
[1:54:01] prayed for him to do what to receive the
[1:54:05] sight and to receive the Holy
[1:54:09] Spirit now the question
[1:54:12] is did Paul receive his sight and the
[1:54:17] Holy
[1:54:19] Spirit that's a question we got the next
[1:54:24] verse and
[1:54:27] immediately they fell from his
[1:54:31] eyes as had been
[1:54:35] SC and he received sight
[1:54:40] fourth you know the Bible says the
[1:54:42] scales fell down and was able to
[1:54:46] see this is ananas this is where I am
[1:54:50] and the Bible says when the scales
[1:54:53] he
[1:54:54] arose and was baptized now the question
[1:54:57] is did Paul who called sa receive the
[1:55:02] Holy Spirit or
[1:55:06] no there was no emotion
[1:55:10] there he didn't start jumping
[1:55:13] around he didn't speak in Tong he didn't
[1:55:17] prophesy they didn't seem feeling
[1:55:19] something different
[1:55:22] the scar spr from the
[1:55:24] eyes he arose and he was baptized and he
[1:55:28] was given F to did he receive the Holy
[1:55:31] Spirit oh
[1:55:34] no I know maybe the writer forgot right
[1:55:37] what
[1:55:41] happened praise the name of the day of
[1:55:44] pentec they said the TS of
[1:55:49] fire then he speaking in tongues
[1:55:52] and then they forget to write what
[1:55:55] happen Paul sa received the Holy Ghost
[1:56:01] without any
[1:56:04] sensation he received the Holy Ghost
[1:56:08] without any
[1:56:11] sensation praise the name of our Lord
[1:56:14] now let us go in the
[1:56:16] message says is this the
[1:56:18] time and then it is in
[1:56:22] slide
[1:56:25] 15 and then it
[1:56:37] says he
[1:56:41] says let us go to 260 paragraph 260
[1:56:44] which I've highlighted there he says all
[1:56:48] these
[1:56:50] Mysteries the mystery of the baptism of
[1:56:53] the Holy
[1:56:56] Ghost without
[1:57:00] [Music]
[1:57:08] sensation I've fallen
[1:57:10] down I felt like the heart is burning I
[1:57:14] jump
[1:57:15] jump the baptism of the Holy
[1:57:17] Ghost without sensation it's one of the
[1:57:21] Mysteries
[1:57:23] which are revealed by this
[1:57:25] message it says the mystery of the
[1:57:27] baptism of the Holy
[1:57:29] Ghost without
[1:57:31] sensation but the person of
[1:57:35] Christ performing in
[1:57:37] you the same
[1:57:40] works that he did when you are seeking
[1:57:43] the Holy Ghost don't look for
[1:57:46] sensation but look for
[1:57:49] Christ to be in you praise the name of
[1:57:52] our Lord look for the life of Jesus
[1:57:56] Christ don't look for running
[1:57:59] around up and down feeling
[1:58:03] emotional look for the life of Jesus
[1:58:05] Christ because brother Bram says it's
[1:58:09] one of the
[1:58:10] Mysteries to be revealed by the seventh
[1:58:13] angel it's one of the Mysteries that God
[1:58:18] revealing
[1:58:19] today in the message that he has given
[1:58:21] to us
[1:58:23] and you see your soul receive the Holy
[1:58:25] Ghost without any
[1:58:30] emotion didn't receive the spirit there
[1:58:33] was no prophesying there was no speaking
[1:58:36] in Tong there was no jumping up and down
[1:58:40] there was no tongue of fire on his there
[1:58:43] was no wind
[1:58:47] around praise the name of the Lord the
[1:58:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:52] without
[1:58:54] emotion praise the name of our Lord
[1:58:57] now I want us to get
[1:59:00] further trying to see that we manage
[1:59:05] time so we go to
[1:59:09] slide I have to jump many things we go
[1:59:12] to slide number
[1:59:16] 12 he
[1:59:18] says you believe God
[1:59:22] and say you believe
[1:59:24] God and haven't received the Holy
[1:59:28] GH then you says there is something
[1:59:32] wrong with your
[1:59:35] face then he says because God is under
[1:59:41] obligation to give every
[1:59:45] believer that
[1:59:47] repents and is
[1:59:49] baptized is under obligation
[1:59:53] to give you the baptism of the Holy
[1:59:58] Spirit now you you see because the Bible
[2:00:01] says 2:
[2:00:04] 38 repent and be baptized in the name of
[2:00:08] Jesus
[2:00:09] CHR and you shall receive the gift of
[2:00:11] the
[2:00:12] Holy for the promise is
[2:00:16] yours and to your
[2:00:18] children and those that are far off
[2:00:22] as far as many as the Lord shall
[2:00:25] call go
[2:00:28] 2: bring it and then get back to
[2:00:31] this praise the name of our Lord he says
[2:00:36] repent have you repented or did you
[2:00:40] repent be
[2:00:42] baptized were you
[2:00:47] baptized for the remission of your
[2:00:50] sins and you
[2:00:52] shall he's not saying you
[2:00:56] may but you
[2:00:59] shall in other words it
[2:01:03] follows you
[2:01:05] shall not you may not you could or
[2:01:11] perhaps
[2:01:12] maybe no you shall receive the gift of
[2:01:17] the Holy Ghost to who verse 39
[2:01:23] for the promises unto
[2:01:26] you put yourself there now and your
[2:01:31] children you can bring them
[2:01:33] in and to all that are far
[2:01:37] off your friends your colleagues all
[2:01:41] others but now in this scripture far off
[2:01:46] me the
[2:01:48] Gentiles we the
[2:01:50] Gentiles we are part of the
[2:01:52] promise and then he says as many as the
[2:01:57] Lord Our God shall call the question is
[2:02:03] are you called of God or you came here
[2:02:05] by
[2:02:12] yourself as many as the
[2:02:17] Lord praise the name of our Lord as many
[2:02:20] as the Lord shall call
[2:02:23] on the day of Pentecost there were
[2:02:25] thousands of people there at the temple
[2:02:29] and when they heard this
[2:02:31] word they said what shall we
[2:02:34] do praise the name of our Lord now we
[2:02:38] need to realize that the Holy Spirit
[2:02:42] starts working on our
[2:02:45] lives time we accept Jesus Christ as our
[2:02:50] personal the holy spirit that appointed
[2:02:54] the
[2:02:54] minister to preach to
[2:02:57] you you didn't appoint the minister to
[2:02:59] come and preach to
[2:03:01] you he's the one who sent the minister
[2:03:04] to come and preach to you it was the Ho
[2:03:08] Spirit when you heard the word it was
[2:03:11] the Holy Spirit was speaking to when you
[2:03:15] believe the word you are believing what
[2:03:17] the Holy Ghost was
[2:03:19] saying when you obey the word
[2:03:22] what the Holy Ghost is
[2:03:24] telling praise the name of so now how
[2:03:28] far is the holy ghost from
[2:03:36] you he the word obey the word the spirit
[2:03:41] comes praise the name of the Lord so now
[2:03:46] the Holy Ghost is the one that justified
[2:03:50] you
[2:03:53] the holy ghost that justified you you
[2:04:00] justify me
[2:04:02] remove you just hear the word word and
[2:04:07] then he takes away your
[2:04:09] sins you obey the word he sanctifies you
[2:04:13] obey the word FS with the Holy Spirit
[2:04:16] the only thing is to obey
[2:04:19] the that's all
[2:04:21] praise the name of our Lord hear the
[2:04:23] word of Gody the word of God the life of
[2:04:27] Jesus Christ will be formed in
[2:04:30] you praise the name of our Lord so it's
[2:04:33] the holy ghost that justifies
[2:04:37] us the holy ghost that sanctifies us and
[2:04:41] it's the holy ghost that fills
[2:04:45] us he knows your walk so he works upon
[2:04:49] your life for the reason
[2:04:52] that he wants to dwell inside of
[2:04:54] you that's what God does obey the word
[2:04:59] and then God
[2:05:01] himself he comes and enters your
[2:05:04] soul praise the name of the
[2:05:07] Lord in John chter
[2:05:11] 14 and then verse
[2:05:14] 21 the Bible says he that has my
[2:05:19] Commandments and keepeth them it is he
[2:05:22] that loveth
[2:05:24] me and he that love me shall be loved of
[2:05:29] my father and I will love him I will
[2:05:33] manifest
[2:05:35] myself praise the name of our Lord he
[2:05:39] that has my
[2:05:41] command it is he that love me and he
[2:05:45] that loveth me Will Be Loved of my
[2:05:48] father and when God loves you what does
[2:05:51] he do he says will come and manifest
[2:05:54] myself
[2:05:56] to praise the name of the Lord ver
[2:06:02] 23 he says Jesus answered and said unto
[2:06:07] him if any man love
[2:06:10] me he will keep my
[2:06:13] words and my father will love
[2:06:17] him and we will come unto him
[2:06:22] and make our
[2:06:24] aboard with
[2:06:26] him when you obey the word when you keep
[2:06:30] the word he says you love
[2:06:33] him and when you love him he also loves
[2:06:36] you and when he loves you he comes down
[2:06:41] and dwells inside your heart that's the
[2:06:44] baptism of the
[2:06:45] Holy and you I love God but I don't have
[2:06:49] the Holy Spirit something wrong
[2:06:52] somewhere praise the name of our Lord
[2:06:55] like now this is a
[2:06:57] bottom praise the name of our Lord this
[2:06:59] is a bottle of water why do I have this
[2:07:03] bottle because there is
[2:07:06] water praise the name of so if you get
[2:07:10] me in town
[2:07:12] walking you know the day is
[2:07:15] hot
[2:07:17] too so that's why I'm moving with the
[2:07:19] water
[2:07:21] and then maybe I siep some water I walk
[2:07:25] if you don't have money I wish also
[2:07:28] somebody to buy some
[2:07:32] water you know the cigarette
[2:07:35] smokers go
[2:07:43] ask and those who are who find that they
[2:07:46] are too thirsty for
[2:07:50] cigar if he get one which has fallen
[2:07:53] down and picks it then starts to
[2:07:57] Puff now this bottle of
[2:08:02] water I have it I move with it because
[2:08:06] there is
[2:08:07] water praise the name of our Lord
[2:08:10] there's
[2:08:11] water but now the moment I finish this
[2:08:15] water it becomes a problem with this
[2:08:18] water you start wondering where to throw
[2:08:21] it
[2:08:23] and unfortunately some of us
[2:08:25] here when we come to church we just
[2:08:28] throw bottles
[2:08:30] anywhere taking them
[2:08:34] there so you start looking for where to
[2:08:36] put it because a problem you can't keep
[2:08:41] it because there's nothing in it it's of
[2:08:44] no use to you but
[2:08:48] now when it has water I keep
[2:08:52] I can't even put it in my
[2:08:53] pocket I can't even put it around my
[2:08:57] w if I'm ring a bicyc I put it along
[2:09:01] the if I have a bag I put it on the
[2:09:05] side you remember those days of
[2:09:07] C people would move with bottles of
[2:09:12] San they are just there after
[2:09:17] shaking because you are keeping it
[2:09:20] because of
[2:09:23] but if you get me in
[2:09:25] town and this bottle the first day you
[2:09:29] get with
[2:09:30] me okay maybe he's going to drink water
[2:09:35] now if the water is not there get with
[2:09:37] the
[2:09:39] bottle then you'll start thinking maybe
[2:09:42] he's going to buy cooking
[2:09:44] oil or he's going to draw from a
[2:09:47] b or is going to buy Para
[2:09:51] so you're not mindful he's going to use
[2:09:53] it if the following day you find with
[2:09:59] EMP start looking at
[2:10:02] me is he
[2:10:05] upright why because you keep something
[2:10:11] valuable like if you have money how do
[2:10:14] you keep the money do you keep it by
[2:10:17] putting it here a bundle and then you
[2:10:18] walk in town
[2:10:23] or you put it
[2:10:24] here there are people who are interested
[2:10:26] in that money than
[2:10:29] you and the Bible says Satan steals the
[2:10:34] word of
[2:10:35] God from your heart he steals it so now
[2:10:40] the Bible is telling us here that if you
[2:10:43] love
[2:10:44] me you keep my
[2:10:47] word and to
[2:10:49] keep you train
[2:10:55] Val like the way you
[2:10:58] money when you have money don't want
[2:11:01] that you have
[2:11:02] money because you will attract
[2:11:05] feels hide it somewhere and then you
[2:11:09] move so even the word of God if we
[2:11:13] really love God we shall have the word
[2:11:16] of God and keep it in our
[2:11:19] heart and he says if you have that word
[2:11:21] in
[2:11:23] your he says I will love
[2:11:25] you when he loves you he comes where the
[2:11:30] word
[2:11:31] is praise the name of Lord and now does
[2:11:34] he come in your heart by filling you
[2:11:37] with the Holy
[2:11:38] Spirit praise the name of our Lord so
[2:11:41] the thing is if you obey the word of God
[2:11:45] you love God when you love God comes
[2:11:49] down himself
[2:11:52] himself that's the scripture we will
[2:11:55] come and make our
[2:11:58] AB he comes and settles
[2:12:01] there he comes and sits there then how
[2:12:05] do you say I have believed 10 years I
[2:12:09] don't have the Holy
[2:12:10] Ghost something
[2:12:12] wrong praise the name of let go back to
[2:12:15] the
[2:12:19] other praise the name of of Our Lord
[2:12:23] 12 it
[2:12:26] says and okay it says you believe God
[2:12:29] and say you believe
[2:12:32] God and you haven't received the Holy
[2:12:35] Spirit there's something wrong with your
[2:12:39] faith because God is under
[2:12:43] obligation to give
[2:12:48] who every believer
[2:12:52] that does what that
[2:12:55] repents and is
[2:12:57] baptized is under
[2:13:00] obligation to give you the baptism of
[2:13:02] the Holy
[2:13:04] Spirit and then you're saying 10 years
[2:13:08] I'm a Believer and I don't have the
[2:13:11] Holy something
[2:13:13] wrong then he says and he is more
[2:13:18] willing to give it to you
[2:13:21] than you
[2:13:23] are to receive
[2:13:27] it praise the name of God is more
[2:13:32] willing to give you the Holy
[2:13:35] Spirit than you are there to receive
[2:13:44] it you don't know what you're looking
[2:13:47] for praise the name of he's more willing
[2:13:51] and he released the Holy
[2:13:54] Ghost praise the name of our Lord so how
[2:13:57] do you say many I don't have the
[2:14:01] Holy what did you believe what do you
[2:14:05] obey something wrong then he
[2:14:09] says that is right there is something
[2:14:13] wrong
[2:14:15] somewhere you just got a mental
[2:14:19] Faith instead of a
[2:14:23] face for God is under
[2:14:27] obligation to keep his
[2:14:32] word praise the name of our Lord God is
[2:14:35] under
[2:14:37] obligation to keep his word praise the
[2:14:40] name of our Lord now let us go to the
[2:14:42] church SL 26
[2:14:52] so now when you look at that
[2:14:55] slide it's a demonstration of who we
[2:14:58] are we have the body and the body has
[2:15:02] five
[2:15:03] senses see here smell taste feel that's
[2:15:10] our body and then the senses help us to
[2:15:13] contact the
[2:15:16] natural they don't help us to contact
[2:15:20] God
[2:15:23] but sometimes we want to contact God by
[2:15:27] the outer
[2:15:33] man I don't I don't feel
[2:15:37] that you want the natural man to feel
[2:15:41] God I feel the presence of God all
[2:15:46] over the this
[2:15:48] body was given the five
[2:15:51] senses were are given to us to contact
[2:15:56] the natural
[2:15:57] world the
[2:15:59] physical
[2:16:01] Conta now inside our
[2:16:05] bodies we have the
[2:16:09] spirit the human
[2:16:11] Spirit and the human
[2:16:14] Spirit has also got five
[2:16:18] senses affections
[2:16:25] like somebody who has affection of
[2:16:31] football if you say I love
[2:16:34] football somebody will ask you what
[2:16:37] happens on
[2:16:39] Friday what happened last week on
[2:16:43] Friday on Friday evening what
[2:16:47] happened then you start saying there was
[2:16:50] nothing
[2:16:51] and if you love football and you don't
[2:16:54] that Uganda was playing on
[2:16:58] Friday and you don't know that you know
[2:17:00] it was playing with South
[2:17:02] Africa and you don't know the number of
[2:17:04] goals
[2:17:05] they and you don't know who
[2:17:07] scored they SC and you don't know who
[2:17:10] leading the
[2:17:11] group you don't love
[2:17:16] football if you love something you
[2:17:19] follow it
[2:17:23] like now I don't know nowadays who is
[2:17:26] the leader of Chess play or the chief
[2:17:30] chess player in the
[2:17:32] world but if you say you love chess and
[2:17:36] you
[2:17:41] play and you
[2:17:43] play you don't know
[2:17:47] in you don't it
[2:17:51] you
[2:17:53] don't so if you say I love
[2:17:58] this like now if you say ah I
[2:18:03] love and then they ask you what have you
[2:18:09] planted I'm still just you don't love
[2:18:13] it you don't love it then you say oh I
[2:18:17] love
[2:18:19] teaching and I a teacher
[2:18:23] when
[2:18:28] open you don't love
[2:18:32] it so you have affection of your
[2:18:37] profession that's
[2:18:39] affection and because of that
[2:18:42] affection you find that you have
[2:18:48] Consciousness there are things you can
[2:18:49] try to feel uhuh think this is not the
[2:18:53] way that is also a sense of the
[2:18:56] spirit and then you have
[2:18:59] reasoning reason about
[2:19:02] that I think this thing may not be like
[2:19:05] this then you have
[2:19:07] [Music]
[2:19:13] imagin
[2:19:17] sports they look at the the lineup
[2:19:21] said I have a
[2:19:23] feeling we may not do
[2:19:28] wellous I wish they had put this player
[2:19:31] here this one
[2:19:33] here there is a time I think last year
[2:19:36] before last
[2:19:37] year I was getting to Ginger town and
[2:19:40] then I saw many vehicles and they were
[2:19:44] hoting I was wondering it was a team in
[2:19:49] Europe maybe had one Flags
[2:19:54] everywhere when you talk to those
[2:19:56] people they will even tell
[2:20:05] you ask them were you
[2:20:10] there today we are going to buy this
[2:20:13] player how much money are you going to
[2:20:16] put but because of the Love of the Game
[2:20:21] only spirit is
[2:20:23] there even know the lineup the age of
[2:20:27] this player how many goals you scored
[2:20:30] how much
[2:20:32] money you know those are things that are
[2:20:35] happening in the
[2:20:37] spirit the spirit has given himself to
[2:20:41] that so even memory he
[2:20:44] remembers oh last season we
[2:20:47] failed we not going to fa
[2:20:51] the human
[2:20:53] Spirit now beyond the human Spirit there
[2:20:57] is the soul now under the
[2:21:03] soul or
[2:21:05] doubt and God is interested in the soul
[2:21:10] he says the soul that
[2:21:13] sin it shall die then he said I put
[2:21:16] blood upon the alt
[2:21:22] of the
[2:21:23] Soul
[2:21:25] now the baptism of the H
[2:21:29] Spirit should go beyond your
[2:21:33] body if it comes on your body you can
[2:21:36] have those emotions crying feeling
[2:21:41] something theost can do that on
[2:21:45] your but you need to go beyond the
[2:21:49] body the Spirit can come upon your human
[2:21:54] spirit and when the Holy Ghost comes on
[2:21:56] your human
[2:21:58] Spirit you will speak in Tong you will
[2:22:01] prophesy you will see
[2:22:04] Visions holy ghost on your human
[2:22:08] Spirit praise the name of the Lord but
[2:22:11] you need the Holy Spirit to go beyond
[2:22:14] your human
[2:22:16] Spirit you need the Holy Spirit to get
[2:22:20] into your
[2:22:21] soul and in the soul one
[2:22:26] sense Faith doubt
[2:22:34] em and that's where the mystery of the
[2:22:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:22:39] is that the holy ghost coming right to
[2:22:43] your
[2:22:45] soul no emotion there in the
[2:22:49] soul but the problem is people look for
[2:22:53] the Holy Ghost to come on the body to
[2:22:57] come on the
[2:22:59] spirit and says I have not received the
[2:23:01] Holy
[2:23:02] Ghost praise the name of the Lord now
[2:23:05] let us look at
[2:23:11] this in the the number slide number me
[2:23:15] get it
[2:23:22] slide number
[2:23:25] 16 it says sorry too narrow but let me
[2:23:29] read
[2:23:34] it okay it
[2:23:36] says now he was talking about those five
[2:23:39] Outlets if you'll get time you read
[2:23:43] it say now to the last
[2:23:49] man to the last man which is the
[2:23:53] soul paragraph
[2:23:56] 125 there is only one sense that
[2:23:59] controls
[2:24:01] that that is free moral
[2:24:06] agents will choose or to
[2:24:09] reject then paragraph
[2:24:13] 126 just the same place and the reason
[2:24:16] that people
[2:24:18] today don't forget this now
[2:24:22] and you'll see what the initial evidence
[2:24:25] of the Holy Ghost
[2:24:31] is says now people can live in this
[2:24:37] Spirit that's a human spirit and dance
[2:24:40] in the spirit they shout in the spirit
[2:24:44] they go to church in the spirit and they
[2:24:46] can absolutely have the real spirit of
[2:24:49] God
[2:24:51] anointed on that
[2:24:57] Spirit still be
[2:25:00] lost and just as devil possessed as they
[2:25:03] can
[2:25:06] be now we got the next one par
[2:25:10] 17 so in paragraph
[2:25:16] 17 he says
[2:25:19] 209 I wish you put the slides
[2:25:23] instead so he says but when it is
[2:25:26] directed from the
[2:25:29] inside it throws all the rest of it
[2:25:34] together so he
[2:25:36] saying our control tower is in the
[2:25:41] soul and that's where God wants to
[2:25:45] sit says if you are directed from the
[2:25:48] insight
[2:25:50] it throws the
[2:25:52] spirit and the human body to be under
[2:25:58] subjection that is the guide
[2:26:01] post that is the control
[2:26:03] tower the inside of the
[2:26:06] inside the soul controls the spirit the
[2:26:11] spirit controls the
[2:26:14] body praise the name of our God and
[2:26:16] that's what we should desire
[2:26:21] that God can come down
[2:26:25] there then he says so on the
[2:26:29] outs okay let us go to paragraph
[2:26:36] 21 why don't you keep those lights there
[2:26:38] until I tell you to go to another so he
[2:26:41] says that's the reason I say people can
[2:26:45] jump up and
[2:26:47] down and speak in Tong people can shout
[2:26:52] lay hands on the sick and heal the sick
[2:26:56] and so forth by faith all these great
[2:27:00] things there by the Holy
[2:27:05] Spirit still be
[2:27:09] lost praise the name of our Lord we go
[2:27:12] to the next
[2:27:14] slide slide number
[2:27:18] 18 now
[2:27:21] brother Bram here is putting an
[2:27:24] emphasis of the baptism of the Holy
[2:27:29] Spirit to go to the soul not to stop at
[2:27:32] your human
[2:27:34] spirit and this is where people get to
[2:27:37] look
[2:27:38] for but you need to see that the Holy
[2:27:42] Spirit gets down to your
[2:27:45] soul there is no emotion in the soul
[2:27:50] the name of our Lord so now here brother
[2:27:54] Bram in
[2:27:57] 1965 in
[2:27:59] December he preached four he preached
[2:28:02] consecutive
[2:28:04] messages on fourth of

[2:28:13] Rapture in the place called yum
[2:28:17] Arizona the following day he preached
[2:28:20] the message things that are to
[2:28:23] be on 50th of December
[2:28:27] 1965 in a place called writer
[2:28:31] California and then on the following
[2:28:35] day 6th of
[2:28:38] December he preached on Modern events
[2:28:40] are made clear by
[2:28:46] prophecy then the following
[2:28:50] 7th of
[2:28:51] December he preached the message
[2:28:55] leadership and now in all this fortive
[2:29:01] messages he was
[2:29:07] directing that the baptism of the Holy
[2:29:10] SP should not stop on your body should
[2:29:14] not stop on your spirit but should go to
[2:29:17] your soul
[2:29:20] and that should be our
[2:29:22] desire that should be our
[2:29:25] interest so now in slide
[2:29:28] 18 in the the message
[2:29:31] Rapture he says you say you got the
[2:29:36] baptism the holy ghost that don't
[2:29:41] mean you are saved not by any long
[2:29:47] ways look here you are a trained
[2:29:56] sh you are then he
[2:30:00] demonstrated he say here is the soul
[2:30:04] next is the spirit this is the body now
[2:30:08] part
[2:30:12] 148 then he says but when it comes to oh
[2:30:16] I got the
[2:30:18] anointing is the genuine
[2:30:21] anointing
[2:30:23] remember had it
[2:30:26] too and
[2:30:28] prophesy so did balam have
[2:30:31] it and
[2:30:33] prophesy but don't have nothing to do
[2:30:36] with
[2:30:38] this the
[2:30:40] Insight that was God's
[2:30:43] seed his from the
[2:30:47] beginning predestinated
[2:30:51] then he said you are
[2:30:54] finished I don't care how much you
[2:30:58] shout speak with Tong run
[2:31:01] shout that has nothing to do with
[2:31:05] it praise the name of so he
[2:31:11] saying the
[2:31:13] body can the Holy Ghost can come on the
[2:31:16] body the Holy Ghost can come on the
[2:31:18] human spirit and you do all those
[2:31:22] things but he says if you are only
[2:31:24] dwelling on
[2:31:26] that you are
[2:31:29] lost but where the Holy Ghost should
[2:31:33] dwell is the
[2:31:35] soul because that's where the gene of
[2:31:38] life
[2:31:40] is now the following day after preaching
[2:31:43] the message
[2:31:44] Rapture he preached the message things
[2:31:47] that are to
[2:31:48] be and he
[2:31:52] says you might still dance in the
[2:31:57] spirit you might speak with Tong and
[2:32:01] them things are
[2:32:02] fine but that is not it
[2:32:06] yet remember the Bible say in the last
[2:32:10] days there shall come for
[2:32:13] Christ not false
[2:32:17] jesuses they wouldn't stand still for
[2:32:19] that
[2:32:21] but false
[2:32:23] Christ false anointed
[2:32:27] ones they are absolutely Anointed with
[2:32:29] the
[2:32:31] spirit with the Holy Spirit and still
[2:32:36] F then he comes to the church there are
[2:32:39] three peop of
[2:32:41] you the outside is the body you got the
[2:32:45] five
[2:32:46] senses that you contact your Earth home
[2:32:49] with that
[2:32:51] inside is a spirit there are five senses
[2:32:55] there love conscious and
[2:32:59] for but the inside of
[2:33:02] that is the
[2:33:05] soul the following day is talking about
[2:33:07] the
[2:33:08] same then we go to the the following
[2:33:11] after preaching the message things that
[2:33:12] are to
[2:33:14] be number
[2:33:16] 20 he says in the message modern events
[2:33:18] are made clear by prophet
[2:33:22] he says notice we find people
[2:33:27] today there's many
[2:33:29] people just can't believe
[2:33:32] it even spirit filled
[2:33:36] people I'm going to give you
[2:33:39] one that will choke
[2:33:41] you the baptism of the Holy
[2:33:45] Ghost don't mean you are going in
[2:33:50] not at all not on that don't have
[2:33:55] nothing to do with your
[2:33:57] soul that's the
[2:33:59] baptism see here is inside the
[2:34:03] soul in here that has to come from
[2:34:09] God EMP on the
[2:34:11] soul says but on the outside you have
[2:34:15] five
[2:34:16] senses you know inlets
[2:34:20] you know to contact your Earthly
[2:34:23] home that's on the body then inside you
[2:34:26] have a
[2:34:27] spirit and in that Spirit you have also
[2:34:31] five
[2:34:32] Outlets your conscience and love and so
[2:34:37] forth five Outlets to that Spirit
[2:34:41] remember that in that
[2:34:44] Spirit that's the human Spirit you can
[2:34:47] be baptized with the genine spirit of
[2:34:51] God and still be
[2:34:54] lost it is the
[2:34:57] soul that lives that was a of
[2:35:01] God praise the name of our that's the
[2:35:04] third time he's doing repeating
[2:35:07] it on the fourth day goes back to
[2:35:10] the in the message
[2:35:12] leadership he
[2:35:16] says many think
[2:35:19] many of you think I got the baptism of
[2:35:22] the Holy
[2:35:24] Ghost I'm going to
[2:35:26] heaven that don't mean one
[2:35:30] thing that you are going to heaven no
[2:35:33] sir you can have the baptism of the Holy
[2:35:37] Ghost every hour in your
[2:35:42] life and still be lost and go to hell
[2:35:47] the Bible says so exactly right then he
[2:35:52] explains paragraph 163 look here you are
[2:35:56] outside
[2:36:01] person you have five senses that contact
[2:36:04] outside
[2:36:06] body God gave you five
[2:36:08] senses not to contact
[2:36:12] him your three
[2:36:15] home see test feel smell and hear
[2:36:22] then you have a spirit on the inside of
[2:36:26] that that's inside the body and it has
[2:36:30] five
[2:36:32] Outlets conscious and love and so forth
[2:36:36] five Outlets that you contact the spirit
[2:36:40] world with
[2:36:42] that with your
[2:36:45] spirit then your
[2:36:47] physical contacts the physical
[2:36:50] your spiritual contact the but inside of
[2:36:55] you you've got a
[2:36:58] soul and that
[2:37:00] soul is that
[2:37:02] gen that come from
[2:37:05] God praise the name of our Lord that's
[2:37:08] where we need the holy
[2:37:10] spirit in the soul and the holy ghost in
[2:37:13] the
[2:37:14] soul there's no
[2:37:16] emotions there's no Sensations
[2:37:21] praise the name of our Lord then he says
[2:37:24] paragra 167 and when a man has been born
[2:37:28] again by the word of
[2:37:33] God predestinated to eternal
[2:37:37] life called the
[2:37:40] elected it will be word of
[2:37:43] God on top of word word on top word on
[2:37:48] Word praise the name of our Lord so
[2:37:53] now when you are seeking the baptism of
[2:37:55] the Holy
[2:37:57] Spirit don't look for
[2:38:01] emotions you can be
[2:38:05] deceived when you are seeking the

[2:47:00] life praise the name of our Lord he has
[2:47:03] chosen the foolish

[2:48:57] charge this man was interested in his
[2:49:00] business wased in his money and he lost
[2:49:03] eternal life but yet in the very Bible
[2:49:07] there was a man called
[2:49:10] Matthew Levi he was a tax collector a
[2:49:14] wealthy man Jesus went to the custom
[2:49:20] and pck him come and follow me he left
[2:49:23] his business and followed
[2:49:26] Jesus there was a Man Called
[2:49:28] Moses he was meant to be the next
[2:49:32] Pharaoh everything was before
[2:49:35] him and when God revealed to
[2:49:38] him
[2:49:40] Moses
[2:49:42] Des the riches that he had the glory
[2:49:45] that he had the the opportunities that
[2:49:50] and he went to be
[2:49:52] identified with the children of God who
[2:49:56] slaves praise the name of our Lord
[2:49:59] Abraham also he had the gospel the
[2:50:02] gospel told him leave your parents leave
[2:50:06] your land come and I take you this way
[2:50:10] Genesis 12
[2:50:11] ver Abraham
[2:50:14] obeyed we also have the same thing
[2:50:16] before us
[2:50:18] the gospel of Christ coming to us what
[2:50:21] are you going to
[2:50:22] choose Christ or the things of the world
[2:50:27] Christ awesome opportunities I
[2:50:30] have now if you take Christ away and
[2:50:34] then you follow other things then the
[2:50:36] Holy Spirit cannot sit in your heart
[2:50:40] because it is
[2:50:42] contrary praise the name of our Lord but
[2:50:44] the Holy Spirit desires to come and live
[2:50:48] in our life
[2:50:50] praise the name of our Lord desires to
[2:50:53] come and live in our
[2:50:55] lives now in the message the
[2:50:57] token he
[2:51:00] says
[2:51:04] 25 and when we can display the token of
[2:51:07] the Holy
[2:51:11] Spirit shows that we have been accepted
[2:51:14] in
[2:51:16] Christ and that is our talk
[2:51:20] that all that we have need
[2:51:23] of is already purchased by him we are
[2:51:29] identified with our token the token must
[2:51:34] be ready the blood Covenant
[2:51:38] blood is not recognized without the
[2:51:42] token the word assures
[2:51:45] us of the promise The Talk
[2:51:49] is the sign the purchase has been made
[2:51:52] for
[2:51:55] us full
[2:51:57] obedience to the full word of
[2:52:01] God entitles us to the
[2:52:04] Token no other way there
[2:52:07] is that you could ever be entitled to

[2:52:12] Token until you fully obey the
[2:52:17] words praise the name of our Lord that's
[2:52:20] how you receive the Holy Spirit obey the
