[20:23] [Music]
[20:27] my
[20:31] precious Heavenly
[20:34] Father this is the lead of
[20:37] Faith Lord in the hands of your
[20:41] servant it's Grace that has brought her
[20:45] to see the face of the
[20:47] [Music]
[20:48] earth I want to take this opportunity
[20:52] Lord to dedicate her into the hands of

[21:30] I also want to pray heavenly
[21:32] father that you may break any negative
[21:36] genetic
[21:39] traits that could have attached
[21:41] themselves to her through these hybd
[21:45] bodies I commit the mother and the

[21:58] example to little of faith in Jesus name
[22:03] I dedicate her
[22:17] amen God bless
[22:21] you what language do you think we are
[22:24] going to speak in
[22:26] heaven
[22:30] those who speak English think they'll
[22:32] speak English in
[22:36] heaven but here on
[22:40] Earth we don't have a holy
[22:45] language so you know there was a
[22:48] Hebrew
[22:51] rber Rabbi Rabbi who used to visit the
[22:55] church in
[22:56] cladel
[22:58] and he said you people
[23:01] here you are waiting for the
[23:05] Messiah but when Messiah
[23:08] comes what language will you speak to
[23:12] him you should come to Israel and learn
[23:18] Hebrew yeah so we've got brother
[23:22] Michael brother Michael is a
[23:25] pastor in church in Camp
[23:29] uh originally he's from
[23:33] Congo but now he's with us in this
[23:38] country and most of the people around
[23:41] her in the
[23:44] assembly they are French speaking
[23:47] people so he speaks he preaches French
[23:51] most of the
[23:53] time amen but uh you know it's speaks
[23:58] very good
[23:59] English but he says for me to
[24:03] flow it must be
[24:06] French
[24:09] so uh I think we need to practice a
[24:13] little
[24:15] bit Amen to hear another
[24:19] language so I will ask sister Faith to
[24:22] come
[24:24] here and give us a little song

[31:25] Interpreter yeah

[31:30] son so it goes very well brother Li you

[32:27] God has given you
[32:30] something Lift Your Hands Say
[32:33] Amen your hands it doesn't kill the
[32:39] preacher amen amen sister Grace sister
[32:42] Grace is still warming
[32:45] up
[32:50] [Applause]
[32:56] bless
[33:21] God bless you
[33:25] all
[33:28] we're glad to be here this
[33:33] morning in God's
[33:55] thought
[34:05] I bless the Lord Jesus
[34:09] Christ for the opportunity he grants us
[34:12] this
[34:16] morning to stand in front of the pches
[34:19] of his
[34:23] blood I feel so small standing in your
[34:26] midst
[34:29] because you're very
[34:32] precious amen amen
[34:37] amen you know that you're so much
[34:40] precious more than the blood of Jesus
[34:41] Christ
[34:45] himself to have
[34:51] you God had to shed his own
[34:55] blood
[34:59] imagine going to a
[35:02] shop you need
[35:06] bread you take money from your
[35:10] pocket and you buy
[35:12] bread you give the
[35:14] money and in exchange they give you
[35:17] bread so what is more
[35:20] important is it your money or the
[35:25] bread had the money been more important
[35:28] you would have kept
[35:30] it but you're giving the
[35:33] money in return for
[35:37] bread because you deem it fit that the
[35:40] bread is more important than your
[35:42] money do we say Amen to
[35:45] that so in order to have
[35:49] you jesus takes his own
[35:54] blood he finds his blood less valuable
[35:57] than you
[35:59] are and freely he gives his
[36:02] blood in exchange for
[36:05] you so you're very
[36:09] valuable much more valuable than the
[36:11] blood of Jesus
[36:15] Christ and brother Brenham
[36:20] says thank
[36:23] you and brother Bram says
[36:28] had I had a drop of
[36:31] blood on a
[36:34] PL the literal blood of Jesus
[36:39] Christ I would pay so much attention to
[36:44] it I'd be so careful with it not to
[36:46] spill
[36:49] it because this blood was shed in order
[36:52] to redeem me respect I respect this
[36:55] Blood
[36:57] but
[37:00] then if I can pay so much attention to a
[37:03] drop of
[37:05] blood right in front of me
[37:10] here I'm standing right in front of the
[37:12] purchase of the blood of Jesus
[37:16] Christ how much more careful will I
[37:21] be knowing that it took his blood to
[37:23] have
[37:24] you he says
[37:28] if I drop down this drop of
[37:31] blood I would be
[37:34] punished it would be a lack of
[37:39] respect but if I lack
[37:43] respect for the acquisition of the
[37:47] blood My Punishment would be
[37:52] greater so understand just how
[37:54] exceedingly small I feel
[37:58] standing in front of such a
[38:01] valuable can you help me and shake your
[38:03] neighbor's hand tell them you're
[38:16] valuable so I feel happy standing in
[38:19] front of valuable
[38:21] people a lot of respect for
[38:25] you of respect for Pastor
[38:29] Steven I feel much
[38:34] honored for about a dozen years since

[44:09] the Pastor
[44:11] said but when I sleep I dream in
[44:17] French so I didn't want to start looking
[44:19] for
[44:22] words when I saw I had an interpreter by
[44:24] my side
[44:27] then I ask myself why preach in English

[46:02] preach but since it was he he seemed to
[46:05] like it that I
[46:06] pray I'll make a little
[46:09] noise without much uh
[46:14] delay I pray you to stand up

[47:26] standing in front of your
[47:30] people we want you to get us out of the
[47:34] way and to take this word
[47:37] yourself to make it come
[47:40] alive in the hearts of your
[47:44] children we believe you do
[47:47] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:50] amen
[47:51] amen you may take your
[47:54] seats
[47:56] for a few
[48:00] minutes I'm going to speak over a little
[48:04] subject I'm going to speak about
[48:10] faith two weeks ago when I was speaking
[48:13] to the
[48:15] pastor and I promised him I was going to
[48:21] come I had no idea what I was going to
[48:24] preach to this great people
[48:30] but something yesterday was put in my
[48:34] heart while we were journeying to come
[48:39] here I thought I am going to just make a
[48:42] little
[48:44] noise on something that you already
[48:48] know very
[48:50] simple I'm going to speak about
[48:54] faith just
[48:57] that
[49:00] faith I'm going to illustrate
[49:04] it in a
[49:05] [Music]
[49:06] story I'll speak to you about
[49:10] faith by narrating a
[49:13] story a little
[49:15] story of Faith amen amen
[49:21] amen you know the Bible
[49:24] says whatever you shall
[49:27] ask
[49:30] praying believe you first that you have
[49:33] received
[49:34] it start by
[49:37] believing that you have received that
[49:41] thing then you shall see it
[49:45] fulfilled so I'm speaking about
[49:49] faith look that when God speaking about
[49:54] faith he's always was talking about it
[49:56] in the
[49:59] past all that you
[50:04] ask believe that you have received it
[50:09] already he does not say believe that you
[50:12] will receive
[50:15] it believe that you have already
[50:18] received it in the
[50:20] past look at the Lord Jesus
[50:23] Christ in front of Lazarus
[50:27] grave Lazarus was in the
[50:31] grave and Jesus got to the
[50:35] Grave he starts by
[50:37] saying
[50:39] father I thank
[50:42] thee
[50:44] because you have always answered my
[50:49] prayers Lazarus had not yet been
[50:51] resurrected
[50:54] yet but but Jesus starts by thanking
[50:58] godre for the resurrection of
[51:01] Lazarus that is Faith am
[51:05] amen so for Jesus it was settled amen
[51:09] amen amen
[51:12] amen so when God says
[51:16] something you've got to believe
[51:20] it have faith in What God
[51:24] Says even thanking
[51:27] him because you believe
[51:30] it start by saying thank you
[51:33] Lord because you have already done
[51:37] it then will you see it
[51:42] happen when I was thinking about
[51:48] faith I started to think about the great
[51:51] man we got in this
[51:53] message as I was
[51:58] saying they're going away one after the
[52:01] other and I have seen
[52:05] some some that have even abandoned the
[52:11] message I saw them preach the
[52:15] message and after a while abandoning
[52:20] it I've seen people lose their
[52:24] faith
[52:27] very recently our dear brother Billy
[52:29] Paul went
[52:33] home I believe people that were not well
[52:37] standing in the faith have even been
[52:41] shaken but I believe here you're not
[52:43] shaken amen amen amen
[52:49] amen so we have seen numerous of them
[52:51] abandoning the
[52:54] message but blessed be God he does not
[52:56] lack
[52:59] Witnesses so I am going to tell you a
[53:03] story in the life of my
[53:06] Prophet the life of your
[53:10] prophet in the
[53:12] life I don't know if he's your Prophet
[53:15] as much as
[53:17] mine how many here believe that God sent
[53:20] us a
[53:21] prophet I believe it with all my
[53:24] heart
[53:26] you're going ask me why do you speak of
[53:27] the
[53:29] Prophet the
[53:32] Pentecostal they speak of
[53:35] Paul what Paul
[53:38] said what they saw in the life of
[53:42] Paul has an effect on their
[53:45] lives they speak about it with
[53:48] joy if the
[53:52] Pentecostal can Rejoice of the writings
[53:55] of of apostle
[53:57] Paul how much more us the
[54:01] Gentiles we also have to be
[54:04] happy of what
[54:06] happened in the life of our
[54:10] Prophet I am not envying the time of
[54:14] Paul because I
[54:16] believe that in this
[54:19] age received one greater than
[54:22] Paul I know that Paul was a great
[54:26] messenger but the messenger of the last
[54:30] day he reached
[54:33] Heights that Paul could not even dream
[54:36] of I have no shame of
[54:39] him I love him so
[54:41] much I love
[54:43] speaking about the things that
[54:45] transpired in his life amen
[54:49] amen to speak the
[54:53] truth Frankly Speaking the the prophet
[54:55] of the end
[54:57] times he is the greatest prophet of the
[55:01] Bible from
[55:03] Enoch to this
[55:06] day we've not had one
[55:09] Prophet like to the prophet of the end
[55:14] time and this
[55:16] prophet he comes to restore
[55:20] Faith that's why to speak of Faith this

[1:27:12] say that this
[1:27:15] bear will be 50 yard from
[1:27:20] here how can you get get that closeth to
[1:27:23] a

[1:43:26] Creek we got
[1:43:29] close and
[1:43:34] then it was right
[1:43:39] there 250 yard
[1:43:44] away I could see his big yellow
[1:43:49] teeth smacking down like

[1:44:48] back yes
[1:44:54] sh from the back it won't be able to
[1:44:56] stand
[1:44:57] anymore I told
[1:45:00] him but the
[1:45:03] vision
[1:45:06] said I would shoot him in the
[1:45:11] heart said
[1:45:14] well then do it that
[1:45:19] way and brother bam
[1:45:23] short the first shot got
[1:45:27] him and as we came
[1:45:31] down we were holding
[1:45:34] this this bear got killed by just one
[1:45:37] shot amen amen amen
[1:45:42] amen we didn't have any ribbon to
[1:45:44] measure him
[1:45:49] with and we said this looks to be around
[1:45:51] 90 in these H I said
[1:45:57] no they are exactly 42
[1:46:02] Ines without having measured he's saying
[1:46:06] this because he believes that God does
[1:46:09] not
[1:46:12] lie and I told
[1:46:14] Eddie I said
[1:46:16] watch the little
[1:46:19] boy
[1:46:22] the little boy is going to put his hands
[1:46:24] right there and
[1:46:29] measure and when we got down to where
[1:46:32] the park
[1:46:34] was we couldn't bring the
[1:46:37] bear we had to go back the next
[1:46:43] day you know
[1:46:46] you when they got the tape
[1:46:49] measure and they
[1:46:52] measured it was
[1:46:56] exactly exactly how it had been
[1:46:59] described in the
[1:47:00] vision just the way it had been
[1:47:04] told Brother Bram did not
[1:47:08] wait to see the
[1:47:10] Fulfillment to
[1:47:14] believe start by
[1:47:17] believing you have a difficult problem
[1:47:22] you asked something from
[1:47:24] God don't wait to see
[1:47:27] it start by
[1:47:31] confessing start by
[1:47:34] believing start by visualizing it become
[1:47:38] real and even
[1:47:41] testify
[1:47:43] amen the more you confess
[1:47:46] it it is bound to
[1:47:49] happen is the power of
[1:47:53] faith is someone with
[1:47:55] me you need
[1:47:58] something simply ask it from
[1:48:02] God while
[1:48:05] believe all that you will have as
[1:48:08] God you will see it
[1:48:11] fulfilled
[1:48:12] everything
[1:48:15] everything when God makes a
[1:48:18] promise you can stand on that
[1:48:23] promise now in the
[1:48:26] Bible what did God promise
[1:48:29] you amen amen amen
[1:48:32] amen now you can read in your
[1:48:35] Bible because when God makes a
[1:48:38] promise he holds his
[1:48:41] promise do you say Amen to
[1:48:44] that in the sermon believing in
[1:48:48] God of in the paragraph
[1:48:53] 81 24th February
[1:48:56] 1952 brother Bram
[1:49:01] says when a Divine promise is
[1:49:06] [Applause]
[1:49:09] made God is in the
[1:49:14] obligation in the
[1:49:18] obligation to fulfill F all his
[1:49:22] promises you can take your
[1:49:25] Bible you can take the
[1:49:28] message if in there you find a
[1:49:31] promise do not have any doubt whatsoever
[1:49:35] because
[1:49:37] God is in the
[1:49:41] obligation he's in the
[1:49:43] obligation of fulfilling his
[1:49:48] promise God is not any more than his
[1:49:52] word is am amen amen
[1:49:56] amen God is simply what his word
[1:50:00] is what his word
[1:50:02] declares that's what he is amen
[1:50:06] amen if this
[1:50:09] word is not
[1:50:12] effective then God is not
[1:50:15] effective but this word is God
[1:50:20] do you believe
[1:50:23] that how many believe
[1:50:25] it that the word is
[1:50:28] God in the
[1:50:30] beginning was the
[1:50:32] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:50:36] was God hallelujah
[1:50:39] hallelujah if he was God
[1:50:42] yesterday this morning he is
[1:50:45] God when you land on a
[1:50:48] promise believe that the promise
[1:50:51] and God does not fail amen
[1:50:56] amen it is God do you believe it the
[1:51:00] Bible
[1:51:02] says in the beginning was the word the
[1:51:05] word was with
[1:51:07] God and the Word was
[1:51:12] God and I am not any I have no more
[1:51:17] worth than my word
[1:51:18] has and
[1:51:21] you you're not any better than your
[1:51:25] word so
[1:51:28] God simply is what his word
[1:51:33] declares look at the
[1:51:36] Assurance look at the Assurance you
[1:51:38] ought to move
[1:51:41] with when I read brother Bram say
[1:51:45] something I am not going to go and
[1:51:48] verify I'm a
[1:51:52] Believer from the moment that he has
[1:51:55] said
[1:51:56] it whether I
[1:51:59] understand or
[1:52:02] not I know that God simply does not
[1:52:06] lie What God Says from his mouth is the
[1:52:11] is the
[1:52:12] truth God is going to fulfill it he told
[1:52:16] Moses Moses go to
[1:52:18] Egypt you will be my
[1:52:23] mouthpiece I will be with you
[1:52:26] as and when Moses went to
[1:52:29] Egypt God was in the
[1:52:32] obligation to be with the mouth of
[1:52:37] Moses if Moses said
[1:52:41] flies even where there were no
[1:52:44] flies the word of
[1:52:47] Moses became synonymous to the word of
[1:52:51] God because
[1:52:53] God I will be with your
[1:52:57] mouth when Moses would say frauds
[1:53:00] throughout the
[1:53:02] land even where they were not
[1:53:05] there because it's a Divine
[1:53:08] promise from
[1:53:11] nothingness the frogs would
[1:53:13] come in this end
[1:53:16] time we've got one greater than Moses
[1:53:21] we've got the great prophet of the
[1:53:23] Bible his
[1:53:25] work is to Lift Us in
[1:53:30] faith all that you read as the stories
[1:53:32] of the
[1:53:33] message they're just to make your faith
[1:53:36] rise
[1:53:38] up to lift your faith up so you can
[1:53:42] advance and in front of difficult
[1:53:46] situations you know right where you're
[1:53:48] standing you can move with
[1:53:52] assurance and say God said
[1:53:55] it God does not lie are we
[1:54:01] together the responsibility is not only
[1:54:05] God's you also have a shared
[1:54:07] responsibility in there amen
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:12] amen now I'm going to end by saying
[1:54:16] this the last
[1:54:18] sermon the very
[1:54:32] last what do you think of
[1:54:34] Christ it's a
[1:54:37] question it's a subject a sermon but
[1:54:40] also a
[1:54:42] question what do you think of
[1:54:44] Christ amen
[1:54:48] amen paragraph
[1:54:51] 53 3rd March
[1:54:55] 1957 the prophet says
[1:54:58] this
[1:55:01] now if
[1:55:05] God comes and manifests himself through
[1:55:07] the logos amen amen
[1:55:12] amen in the form of the Holy
[1:55:16] Spirit and that he does the same works
[1:55:20] for this
[1:55:21] man that he did for
[1:55:24] Philip or for
[1:55:28] Nathaniel is everyone here going to
[1:55:30] believe him amen amen
[1:55:35] amen fulfilling a work is one
[1:55:40] thing now the problem
[1:55:43] comes after having seen God doing these
[1:55:48] things
[1:55:50] is everyone
[1:55:53] here is everyone here going to believe
[1:55:56] him the assembly the congregation says
[1:56:03] amen is that going to fulfill what he
[1:56:05] said according to the
[1:56:07] word he says well
[1:56:10] look
[1:56:14] this is God's part in the
[1:56:18] meeting in the meeting
[1:56:21] God has his part am amen
[1:56:25] amen what is God's
[1:56:28] part to
[1:56:30] fulfill what he
[1:56:32] promised I'm going to ask you a
[1:56:35] question has God
[1:56:38] fulfilled what he promised in this
[1:56:42] age in
[1:56:44] Mal in Luke
[1:56:46] 17
[1:56:48] revelation and someone raise their hand
[1:56:50] and say that God fulfilled these
[1:56:53] things that's God's
[1:56:56] part to fulfill his
[1:57:00] promise this is God's part in the
[1:57:04] meeting my
[1:57:07] part the part of Pastor
[1:57:11] Steven is to
[1:57:13] preach do we say amen God has done
[1:57:18] that's his part
[1:57:21] the pastor
[1:57:22] comes does his
[1:57:24] part which is
[1:57:27] to to preach to
[1:57:30] you
[1:57:32] now your
[1:57:36] role your
[1:57:40] part is to
[1:57:43] believe that someone
[1:57:46] said everyone has their role to play
[1:57:52] God FS fulfills his
[1:57:55] word the man of God sees
[1:57:58] it his
[1:58:01] responsibility is to preach these things
[1:58:03] to
[1:58:04] you but it does not end
[1:58:08] there you the congregation on the
[1:58:10] benches
[1:58:12] there after having heard these
[1:58:15] things you also have a
[1:58:18] responsibility responsibility what is
[1:58:20] your
[1:58:21] responsibility to
[1:58:26] believe God's
[1:58:29] part is to
[1:58:31] vindicate amen amen
[1:58:35] amen God always
[1:58:39] vindicates he always plays his part
[1:58:43] hallelujah
[1:58:45] amen now the
[1:58:48] problem
[1:58:50] is not a pastor's
[1:58:53] problem I know that the pastor preaches
[1:58:55] these things to
[1:58:57] you and he tells you these things have
[1:58:59] been
[1:59:01] Vindicated they are real they are
[1:59:05] perfect but after having preached these
[1:59:08] things now you have a
[1:59:12] responsibility responsibilities as
[1:59:15] Believers your responsibility is to
[1:59:18] believe
[1:59:19] to believe what has been preached
[1:59:22] what the moment you
[1:59:26] believe everything becomes
[1:59:31] possible had it been impossible
[1:59:34] yesterday just
[1:59:36] believe amen amen amen
[1:59:39] amen
[1:59:41] faith faith brings God to the
[1:59:46] sin Faith changes circumstance
[1:59:50] it changes
[1:59:53] atmosphere in that dimension of
[1:59:56] faith everything is
[2:00:00] possible the things that God has done
[2:00:05] today if you simply hear these
[2:00:09] things and that you get no faith from
[2:00:13] them it just means you are not
[2:00:16] predestinated to have that
[2:00:18] faith the message that we
[2:00:21] have when you hear the
[2:00:24] T when you hear the pastor
[2:00:28] preaching the mission of
[2:00:31] malach is to restore
[2:00:36] faith faith has got to
[2:00:39] rise faith has to
[2:00:43] grow you've got to live in
[2:00:46] faith faith is a reality
[2:00:51] for any promise that God has
[2:00:55] made all that God has given to you as
[2:01:00] promise
[2:01:04] believe May those that do not believe
[2:01:08] stand whether they stand and say it's
[2:01:10] not
[2:01:11] fulfilled we do not believe
[2:01:14] this these things have not been given to
[2:01:17] them that do not believe
[2:01:20] these things are given to
[2:01:24] Believers let those that don't believe
[2:01:26] keep not
[2:01:28] believing but the
[2:01:31] believer will say
[2:01:35] Amen whether or not they understand what
[2:01:38] they
[2:01:41] mean whether they are in capacity to
[2:01:44] explain these
[2:01:46] things in the deeps of their heart
[2:01:50] they believe that the message is
[2:01:53] true because the message that we have
[2:01:57] received is not the human
[2:02:02] intellect it is not a man that came
[2:02:04] preaching to
[2:02:06] us the message that we have received
[2:02:11] God God borrowed a
[2:02:14] body a body in which he could
[2:02:17] enter dwell and speak to the
[2:02:21] bride to start with the message is
[2:02:25] perfect when you hear it when you read
[2:02:29] it simply open up your
[2:02:32] heart simply say amen amen amen amen
[2:02:37] amen the more you say
[2:02:40] Amen the more the word comes alive in
[2:02:44] you even in your
[2:02:47] bedroom in your office
[2:02:49] office have the
[2:02:52] word have it in your phones in your
[2:02:56] laptops have them in your
[2:02:59] phones simply dwell in that
[2:03:03] atmosphere and the word is
[2:03:05] creating creating an atmosphere of
[2:03:09] faith and in this atmosphere of
[2:03:12] faith everything becomes
[2:03:16] real faith can make you a bizar
[2:03:20] that's not understandable does someone
[2:03:22] believe this
[2:03:24] morning someone that has a difficult
[2:03:28] problem a problem that he calls
[2:03:30] impossible to
[2:03:32] solve does someone
[2:03:35] believe with everything that you have
[2:03:38] heard is there someone that believes
[2:03:40] this morning someone that feels that
