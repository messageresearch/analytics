[40:45] Praise the Lord.
[40:47] Amen. Amen. We may be seated.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; I want to greet you in the precious name
[40:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; And welcome back, brother Jeremiah.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Hope he makes a declaration at the end
[41:08] of the service,
[41:10] [laughter]
[41:12] but he's here anyway. So, you are
[41:14] welcome
[41:17] and we trust that the Lord has kept you

[41:56] unto us.

[42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:01] [music]
[42:23] God bless.
[42:37] Oh bless you.
[42:42] There's no one great
[42:45] amongst [singing] us.
[42:49] We are nothing
[42:53] on our own.
[42:56] [singing]
[42:58] We make mistakes
[43:01] and no [singing] offense. [music]
[43:06] just come on flesh
[43:09] and [music and singing] bone.
[43:13] But someday I'll [singing] prove just
[43:17] why I say
[43:21] the town
[43:23] of a [singing] special
[43:26] kind.
[43:29] For [singing and music] when he
[43:31] was on
[43:33] the cross,
[43:38] I was [music and singing] on
[43:41] his mind
[43:48] for he knew
[43:52] me.
[43:56] Can't he love [singing and music]
[44:00] me?
[44:07] He
[44:08] whose [music and singing] glory
[44:11] flame
[44:12] the heaven [singing]
[44:15] shine. [music]
[44:17] Our so unworthy.
[44:23] unworthy. [music and singing]
[44:30] Oh, [singing] such [music] mercy.
[44:38] Oh, when he [music]
[44:41] was [singing] on
[44:43] the cross,
[44:46] I know
[44:49] I was on [singing and music]
[44:52] his mind.
[45:01] The [music and singing] look of love
[45:04] was on his face.
[45:08] The thorns
[45:11] were on his [singing and music] head.
[45:17] Blood [singing]
[45:18] was [music] on his scalro
[45:24] and it was [singing] stained and crimson
[45:30] red.
[45:33] And though
[45:35] his eyes were on the ground
[45:39] that day,
[45:42] my Lord looked [music] ahead
[45:45] in time [singing]
[45:49] [music] when he
[45:52] was on
[45:54] that [singing] cross.
[45:56] Oh, [screaming]
[45:59] [music] you are all
[46:02] his [singing]
[46:03] mine.
[46:08] [music]
[46:09] &gt;&gt; For [singing]
[46:10] he knew.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; My [singing] God knew me.
[46:18] He loved me.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Oh
[46:21] [singing] yes. He loved me with his
[46:26] glory.
[46:28] [music]
[46:29] [singing]
[46:33] The [music] heaven
[46:35] [singing] shine.
[46:38] I was so unworthy. [singing]
[46:44] &gt;&gt; I [music] was
[46:47] not worthy.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, such mercy.
[46:55] [music]
[46:58] Oh,
[47:00] when [singing] he [music]
[47:02] was all
[47:04] right.
[47:07] Oh, I know. [music and singing]
[47:10] I was
[47:14] I was [screaming]
[47:17] worthy.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; [music]
[47:23] [singing]
[47:25] &gt;&gt; worthy.
[47:30] [singing]
[47:33] My Jesus loved me [singing] and
[47:38] he
[47:39] was on [singing] the cross.
[47:44] I know
[47:46] [music and singing]
[47:47] I was all.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [applause]
[48:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Y I spent in vanity [singing]
[48:25] and pride
[48:28] caring
[48:29] not [music and singing] my Lord was
[48:31] crucified
[48:35] knowing [singing]
[48:37] not [music] it was for me He died
[48:42] [music and singing]
[48:51] [singing]
[48:53] [music] and grad.
[48:59] There [music] was mountain
[49:04] [singing]
[49:06] [music]
[49:10] [singing]
[49:14] [music]
[49:19] by [singing]
[49:21] God's word at last [music] my sin I
[49:27] Then I tremble [music and singing]
[49:30] at the door.
[49:34] See
[49:35] my [music] guilty destroying [singing]
[49:41] your [music]
[49:43] [singing]
[49:50] [singing]
[49:56] I know there was [singing] mountain
[50:05] [singing]
[50:07] [music]
[50:13] [singing]
[50:13] [music]
[50:18] by [music and singing] your
[50:22] everything.
[50:26] Now [music] I got the holy [singing]
[50:29] land my king.
[50:33] [music] Now [singing]
[50:34] my rocks are so good.
[50:39] [music]
[50:40] Oh [singing] God.
[50:44] Oh mighty
[50:52] Christmas
[50:55] [music]
[51:00] to you [singing and music]
[51:02] and
[51:06] so
[51:07] mighty [music and singing]
[51:12] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Oh [singing]
[51:19] my love [music] that true salvation.
[51:24] Oh
[51:27] my god. [music and singing]
[51:32] Oh [singing]
[51:34] the [music] mighty God of the glories.
[51:40] [music and singing]
[51:43] Oh Lord your mercy was
[51:49] [music and singing] great.
[51:53] I am
[51:55] [music]
[52:00] my burden. [singing]
[52:03] My heart [music] and soul found
[52:09] [music]
[52:11] [singing]
[52:18] my [singing] body and selfarting.
[52:26] [singing]
[52:28] &gt;&gt; [music]
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:40] That's very wonderful.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; So we thank God for this morning.
[52:46] And uh you see when you think of Calvary
[52:53] that's where it began
[52:56] and it was finished.
[52:59] Are you together with me? That's where
[53:02] it began
[53:04] and it was finished. He just said it is
[53:07] finished.
[53:09] Amen. And then he never came back to the
[53:13] cross again.
[53:15] all that you have need of
[53:18] Calvary had [snorts] the solution.
[53:23] Amen. Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; So there are certain things
[53:26] that we really need to understand
[53:30] because they are the core foundation
[53:34] of our redemption.
[53:36] things like redemption,
[53:39] things like atonement,
[53:41] the power of Calvary,
[53:44] those are great things for us. If they
[53:48] don't become the foundation of our
[53:50] faith,
[53:52] then we become our own foundation
[53:57] and we cannot make it that way.
[54:00] So, you are welcome to the house of the
[54:02] Lord,
[54:03] brother Richard. You are welcome.
[54:06] Amen. Our brother, you welcome from
[54:08] Buend.
[54:10] God bless you, brother Duncan. And
[54:11] everybody who's coming down.
[54:14] Amen. And our brother back there,
[54:17] you are going to go back and you are
[54:20] going to be on the bench.
[54:23] Amen. For those uh uh election cases and
[54:27] stuff.
[54:30] So let's just pray for the peace of our
[54:32] country.
[54:34] to us. We have got a kingdom.
[54:37] Amen. Amen. We are not establishing one.
[54:42] We have a kingdom
[54:44] and we are in that kingdom
[54:47] and we need to appreciate God for there
[54:50] is a form of satisfaction
[54:53] that once you are in Christ there is a
[54:56] form of satisfaction.
[54:58] Amen. Amen. So um
[55:03] today
[55:05] I want you to remember the words of
[55:08] Jesus Christ
[55:11] when he says remember
[55:14] I mean take heed you hear
[55:19] you see sometimes people hear things
[55:23] and they give them a slant.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; But take heed.
[55:29] How are you here?
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's stand up and get to
[55:35] John chapter 3
[55:37] and verse 16.
[55:40] Very common scripture
[55:42] that we are going to deal with today.
[55:45] But before we read, let us have a word
[55:48] of prayer.
[55:50] Precious heavenly father, we give thanks
[55:54] and we give honor to you for the grace
[55:59] that you have poured unto us,
[56:02] &gt;&gt; father. Grace that's greater than all
[56:05] our mistakes and failures.
[56:09] The songwriter wrote and says, "Grace
[56:11] that's greater than our sin,
[56:16] the greater to solve the less.
[56:21] May you precious heavenly father
[56:24] take this time and help us to dig in
[56:29] into the promises of this hour
[56:31] that we may be anchored heavenly father
[56:35] and learn the purpose
[56:37] of the glory that we give to you
[56:40] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[56:44] So John 3:16,
[56:47] for God so loved the world
[56:52] that he gave his only begotten son
[56:57] that whosoever believeth in him
[57:00] should not perish
[57:02] but have everlasting life.
[57:06] May the Lord add blessing the reading of
[57:08] his word
[57:10] and you may be seated.
[57:13] So um the scripture says
[57:17] for God
[57:20] so loved the world.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; So my subject this morning
[57:28] is the world
[57:30] that Jesus died for.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; The world
[57:36] that Jesus died for
[57:39] &gt;&gt; because he died for a known world.
[57:45] So God loved the world.
[57:51] Now not a world
[57:54] but the world,
[57:56] &gt;&gt; a specific world.
[58:00] So we are going to speak about the world
[58:04] that Jesus died for. He didn't die for
[58:08] this world.
[58:10] This world has its god
[58:14] and the god of this world
[58:16] blinds the people.
[58:19] Amen. So let us now establish the two
[58:22] worlds here
[58:25] the two kingdoms.
[58:27] So in Isaiah chapter 14
[58:31] and verse 13
[58:33] if the holy spirit can help us to grasp
[58:35] this.
[58:38] He says, "For thou hast said in thine
[58:41] heart."
[58:44] Now you know the prophet Isaiah,
[58:50] now a prophet is a discerner
[58:54] of the intents of the heart.
[58:58] So we see in the ministry of brother
[59:00] Brham,
[59:02] he would look into the hearts of the
[59:04] people.
[59:05] He would tell the intents of their
[59:08] hearts.
[59:10] Are you together with me? Amen. And so
[59:13] the prophet Isaiah
[59:16] is now discerning the heart of Lucifer.
[59:22] The cause of his fall
[59:24] and therefore the fall of the entire
[59:26] world
[59:28] was the condition of his heart.
[59:31] Amen. Amen. He said, "For thou has said
[59:34] in thine heart,
[59:36] I will ascend into heaven.
[59:39] I will exalt my throne
[59:43] above the stars of God.
[59:46] I will sit also.
[59:51] Amen. Upon the mouth of the congregation
[59:56] in the sides of the north.
[1:00:00] Now when he says, "I will also arise and
[1:00:04] sit
[1:00:06] upon the mouth of the congregation
[1:00:10] in the sides of the north
[1:00:13] who is because there was one that was
[1:00:17] high above
[1:00:20] all creation."
[1:00:22] And then Lucifer says, "I will also
[1:00:27] establish my throne."
[1:00:30] He says, "I will ascend above the
[1:00:31] heights of the clouds.
[1:00:35] I
[1:00:37] sides of the north.
[1:00:39] We will be like THE MOST HIGH."
[1:00:43] So now Lucifer is establishing a
[1:00:46] competing kingdom,
[1:00:50] a different world from the world that we
[1:00:53] are talking about.
[1:00:55] So Satan built a parallel world system
[1:01:01] and that's what he wanted to trade.
[1:01:04] That's the one he wanted to trade.
[1:01:09] when he said to Jesus, "Bow before me
[1:01:14] and I'll give you all these cities."
[1:01:17] Amen. Amen. He has his head.
[1:01:20] And the prophet told
[1:01:23] about Satan's Eden. Now, this end of
[1:01:26] Satan,
[1:01:28] it is one that was created
[1:01:31] after the fall. I think let's visit the
[1:01:34] book of Genesis
[1:01:37] chapter 4 and look at the four.
[1:01:41] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:47] Now, in Genesis 4:16,
[1:01:51] Cain went out from the presence of the
[1:01:54] Lord.
[1:01:56] He's no longer in the presence now.
[1:01:59] He has walked out
[1:02:02] from the presence and brought in the
[1:02:04] land of not
[1:02:06] in the east of Eden.
[1:02:09] And Cain knew his wife
[1:02:12] and she conceived
[1:02:14] and bare Enoch.
[1:02:16] This Enoch is not the Enoch who went to
[1:02:19] the house. Amen. and he builded a city
[1:02:24] and called the name of the city
[1:02:28] after the name of his son Enoch.
[1:02:31] Are you together with me? Now Cain has
[1:02:35] walked away from the presence of the
[1:02:36] Lord.
[1:02:38] But Adam and Eve,
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they remain in the presence of
[1:02:45] the Lord.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? But Cain who
[1:02:51] was a seed of the evil
[1:02:54] is now the condute.
[1:02:57] Amen. That the enemy is using
[1:03:00] to establish a parallel world system.
[1:03:07] Amen. So what does Satan do? Verse 18.
[1:03:13] And was called Ira.
[1:03:16] And Ira begat mel.
[1:03:19] Andel begat methusel.
[1:03:23] And begat lame.
[1:03:26] And lame took unto him two words.
[1:03:30] The beginning of the four.
[1:03:32] Polygamy is here right now.
[1:03:36] And the name of one was
[1:03:39] and the other was Zilla.
[1:03:42] and and under Jaba
[1:03:46] and was the father
[1:03:48] of such as dwelling tents
[1:03:51] and of such as half cattle
[1:03:54] and his brothers
[1:03:56] name was Jubel
[1:03:59] and he was the father of all
[1:04:01] of such as handled the harp and organ
[1:04:07] music in the church
[1:04:10] is ABOUT WORSHIP
[1:04:12] BUT THEN IN ADAM, IN KANE'S LIFE,
[1:04:16] the alternative world system
[1:04:19] BECAUSE THEY HAVE FALLEN
[1:04:21] THERE IS NO joy there. They needed music
[1:04:25] for entertainment.
[1:04:28] Are you together with me? Music on this
[1:04:30] other side
[1:04:32] is appreciation of redemption.
[1:04:36] Therefore, it is worship. But music on
[1:04:39] the other side is because they ARE A
[1:04:41] FALLEN WORLD.
[1:04:43] There is no peace in their hearts. There
[1:04:46] is no joy in their heart. They exercise
[1:04:49] music which is not worship appreciation
[1:04:54] to God. They say music as form of
[1:04:57] entertainment
[1:04:59] to create a temporary joy.
[1:05:03] Amen. Amen. So and verse 22
[1:05:07] and Z saw bear tuberc
[1:05:12] instructor of every aton
[1:05:19] and the sister of chupocine was Nama.
[1:05:24] So we see manufacturing
[1:05:29] Amen came from among those people.
[1:05:32] Amen. because they are trying to build
[1:05:37] an end of comfort.
[1:05:40] Ours
[1:05:42] is coming. But the words of the devil is
[1:05:46] already here.
[1:05:50] And then Satan up on the mountain
[1:05:53] is telling Jesus, you worship me, I give
[1:05:57] you the cities.
[1:05:59] So listen friend, we are in this world
[1:06:02] but not of this world.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; We are in this WORLD BUT WE DON'T BELONG
[1:06:10] TO THESE CITIES.
[1:06:12] NO SIR, these cities here. They are the
[1:06:15] origin of another alternative world.
[1:06:21] A world that Jesus did die for.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? So there is a
[1:06:28] world
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; that had been taken over by the devil,
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; but was NOT FOR THE DEVIL.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WORLD now that Jesus dies for
[1:06:43] you together with me.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; So on this other side, we see Satan
[1:06:47] establish his kingdom.
[1:06:51] But we know AS THE PASTOR PREACHED HERE
[1:06:53] the other day THAT THERE IS COMING A
[1:06:56] STORM
[1:06:58] CUT WITHOUT hand
[1:07:00] to destroy this kingdom.
[1:07:03] Amen. So we in this world but NOT OF
[1:07:06] THIS WORLD. DON'T TRY TO COPY
[1:07:10] THEIR lifestyle
[1:07:13] because we are different from them.
[1:07:16] When they put on short dresses,
[1:07:19] put on a long one. when they do tight
[1:07:22] ones do something which is comforting
[1:07:26] of this world because it's naked souls.
[1:07:31] Amen. They are naked souls.
[1:07:34] Amen. They don't care put on show sit in
[1:07:38] front of the priest.
[1:07:42] But when you are a child of God,
[1:07:45] YOU ARE COVERED LIKE THE BRIDE IS
[1:07:47] COVERED.
[1:07:49] YOU SIT WITH COMFORT.
[1:07:52] WE ARE NOT OF THIS WORLD. We cannot live
[1:07:55] like THIS WORLD. We are called out OF
[1:07:59] HERE.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. SO, Satan built a power world
[1:08:07] system
[1:08:09] and they said he wanted to trade it
[1:08:13] WITH YOUR REDEMPTION.
[1:08:16] AMEN. AMEN. So now life
[1:08:19] in the DEVIL'S WORLD
[1:08:22] is an imitation.
[1:08:25] An imitation.
[1:08:28] Now let me tell you one thing. He knew
[1:08:33] that there is coming a new Jerusalem,
[1:08:36] a seat from above.
[1:08:39] He started building his own.
[1:08:42] Amen. Amen. GOD CREATED ADAM AND EVE.
[1:08:47] TO MULTIPLY.
[1:08:50] AND SO ALSO HIM, THE FALSE VINE,
[1:08:55] THE FALSE VIN ALSO sneaked himself
[1:09:01] into the right womb
[1:09:03] with the wrong seed and brought forth
[1:09:06] Cain, brought Adam into marriage.
[1:09:10] That was the desire of GOD
[1:09:13] THAT ADAM SHOULD be married.
[1:09:17] And then the promise for marriage
[1:09:20] was only given to Adam to to God. See,
[1:09:25] but outside in the world, we see these
[1:09:28] marriages, how miserable they are
[1:09:32] because they are not promised TO THEM.
[1:09:37] MARRIAGE was a promise
[1:09:39] to the seed to multiply.
[1:09:43] Are you together with me? So when you
[1:09:45] are A CHILD OF GOD, the only way we can
[1:09:48] know you are
[1:09:51] is when we look at what is the original
[1:09:56] and stand by that not going on in
[1:10:00] marriage simply because so and so is
[1:10:03] married.
[1:10:05] Amen. Amen. SO THE OTHER LIFE
[1:10:08] OF THAT WORLD is an impersonation.
[1:10:12] Where there's MUSIC FOR WORSHIP,
[1:10:15] I PLAY music for entertainment.
[1:10:20] Amen. Amen. So we are two specific
[1:10:23] worlds.
[1:10:25] But when God addresses us with
[1:10:27] salvation,
[1:10:30] he's speaking to a specific world.
[1:10:34] I want you to notice that he speaks to a
[1:10:38] specific one.
[1:10:41] So the only way you could be reborn
[1:10:45] is because you are a seed that came from
[1:10:48] God.
[1:10:51] The promise for rebirth
[1:10:54] is NOT TO THE WORLD IS TO THE WORLD THAT
[1:10:58] Jesus died for.
[1:11:02] Amen. Amen. SO YOU COME FROM GOD.
[1:11:05] YOU KNOW WHO you are. You are a seed
[1:11:08] CHIN FROM GOD. AND THAT SEED already has
[1:11:13] eternal life.
[1:11:16] Amen. BUT NOW THAT ETERNAL life is held
[1:11:22] in a form of darkness
[1:11:26] like A LIFE WAS COVERED BY DARKNESS
[1:11:30] IN GENESIS 1. SO THE PREACHING OF THE
[1:11:33] gospel
[1:11:35] is to that seed
[1:11:38] AND THAT PREACHING IS TO DECLARE THE
[1:11:41] LIGHT
[1:11:43] TO GET AWAY FROM THE SEA
[1:11:46] SO that the sea can become a manifested
[1:11:50] son of God.
[1:11:53] Let there be life.
[1:11:56] Amen. Amen. SO WE PREACHERS WE ARE NOT
[1:12:00] creating seed.
[1:12:03] NO SIR THE SEED IS ETERNAL
[1:12:07] AND IT HAS ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:12:10] that what our WORK IS
[1:12:13] IS TO DECLARE the gospel
[1:12:16] so that he can remove the darkness
[1:12:22] because we are not putting your names
[1:12:25] on the lamb's book of life.
[1:12:29] OUR NAMES WERE PUT ON the lamb's book OF
[1:12:32] LIFE
[1:12:34] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world.
[1:12:37] Are you together with me? So I WANT YOU
[1:12:39] TO UNDERSTAND
[1:12:41] WHO YOU are and we ought to look at
[1:12:44] YOURSELVES
[1:12:47] from the area of election.
[1:12:50] Amen. The other WORLD OF THE FALSE VINE
[1:12:55] THAT'S NOT OUR IDENTITY.
[1:13:00] Why we could be born
[1:13:03] from a natural birth
[1:13:06] like a can everywhere?
[1:13:09] We are two different worlds.
[1:13:14] Are you together with me? You see, I'M
[1:13:17] TALKING ABOUT THE SEED.
[1:13:22] I'm not talking about this veil here.
[1:13:27] Amen. Amen. I'm talking about the sin
[1:13:32] that comes from God predestinated
[1:13:37] and gets INTO A BODY OF FLESH
[1:13:40] and is conquered
[1:13:42] in A WORLD OF SIN.
[1:13:45] THAT'S THE ONLY WORLD JESUS COULD DIE
[1:13:47] FOR.
[1:13:51] HIS DEATH
[1:13:53] DOES NOT BENEFIT THE OTHER WORLD.
[1:13:56] IT ONLY BENEFITS OUR WORLD.
[1:13:59] THOSE WHO COME from God,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; I say take heed.
[1:14:07] How will you hear?
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; We are a world known by fornowledge
[1:14:20] and election.
[1:14:24] Are you together with You see THERE IS
[1:14:27] NO WAY
[1:14:29] ANOTHER PERSON
[1:14:31] from the fallen world can squeeze INTO
[1:14:34] THIS
[1:14:36] because this deals with life
[1:14:40] IS ABOUT ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:14:43] IT'S ABOUT SEED THAT COME FROM GOD.
[1:14:47] THERE IS NO WAY MY PREACHING, HOWEVER
[1:14:51] POWERFUL IT CAN BE, CAN TRANSFORM YOU
[1:14:55] FROM THE FALLEN WORLD INTO THIS.
[1:14:58] THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL IS TO SEEK
[1:15:01] AND TO FIND THAT WHICH WAS LOST.
[1:15:08] Are you TOGETHER WITH ME? THAT'S THE
[1:15:10] PURPOSE OF THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL
[1:15:14] IS TO REDEEM
[1:15:16] and redemption.
[1:15:18] You are DEALING WITH SOMETHING
[1:15:21] THAT WAS here and finally is here. SO
[1:15:26] NOW YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT AND BRING IT
[1:15:30] BACK INTO THE original position.
[1:15:37] That's why we preach TO BRING YOU BACK
[1:15:41] BECAUSE YOU WERE TRAPPED
[1:15:44] in a world where you don't belong.
[1:15:48] Jesus says you are in this world but not
[1:15:51] of this world.
[1:15:54] So you have to learn
[1:15:57] how you hear.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; You don't listen TO THE GOSPEL.
[1:16:06] LIKE THE REST of them listen to this.
[1:16:10] No, your hearing is totally different.
[1:16:14] Your hearing is intended TO MAKE YOU
[1:16:18] IDENTIFY
[1:16:20] WHO YOU ARE.
[1:16:25] So now in Romans chapter 8
[1:16:29] and verse 29
[1:16:32] the Holy Spirit SAYS FOR WHOM he did for
[1:16:40] heing his seed now
[1:16:46] FOR WHOM HE DID FOR
[1:16:49] he also predestinate
[1:16:52] to conform to the image of HIS SON
[1:16:56] that he might be the firstborn
[1:17:00] among many brethren.
[1:17:02] Moreover, WHOM HE DID,
[1:17:06] then he also called
[1:17:09] and whom he called them he also
[1:17:12] justified.
[1:17:15] And whom he justified,
[1:17:17] he also glorified.
[1:17:21] Now these scriptures here
[1:17:24] ARE SO SPECIAL.
[1:17:26] If you look at them, these scriptures
[1:17:30] are addressing US IN THE PAST TENSE.
[1:17:39] Are you together with me? HE SAYS THOSE
[1:17:43] WHOM HE DID FOR
[1:17:47] he also did PREDESTINATE
[1:17:52] to be conformed into the image of his
[1:17:55] son.
[1:17:58] Those whom before YOU HEAR
[1:18:01] he predestinated THEM
[1:18:04] TO COME into the image of his son
[1:18:08] ON THIS OTHER SIDE.
[1:18:11] SO THE JOURNEY of your redemption
[1:18:14] is to bring you from a world of DARKNESS
[1:18:19] THAT HAD COVERED your seed.
[1:18:23] Amen. Amen. And now it has to speak away
[1:18:27] that DARKNESS
[1:18:31] and then you begin
[1:18:34] TO GROW
[1:18:36] INTO the image OF HIS SON.
[1:18:40] AMEN.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; THAT promise
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; is only for those whom he did FOR
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. SO THAT HE MIGHT BE
[1:18:55] THE firstborn
[1:18:57] among many brethren,
[1:19:00] meaning that you may become his brother.
[1:19:05] Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; So moreover predestinate.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; To them he also CALLED
[1:19:19] HE CALLS PREDESTINATED SEA
[1:19:25] AND WHOM HE CALLED THEM HE JUSTIFIED.
[1:19:29] AND WHOM HE JUSTIFIED
[1:19:32] HE SANCTIFY.
[1:19:37] IN THE BOSOM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:19:40] SO THE WORK OF CHRIST
[1:19:43] IS TO A SPECIFIC PEOPLE
[1:19:48] that is too strong.
[1:19:51] But that's the truth.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So we are a WORLD
[1:20:00] THAT HAD FALLEN
[1:20:03] but kind seed
[1:20:06] doesn't fall.
[1:20:10] That's their nature.
[1:20:13] That's what they've always been and will
[1:20:15] always be.
[1:20:18] Our preaching
[1:20:20] can make them religious men
[1:20:24] but cannot make them that seat.
[1:20:30] Are you together with me? It can make
[1:20:32] them religiously
[1:20:35] but it cannot make them
[1:20:38] that predestinated sin
[1:20:42] BECAUSE REDEMPTION
[1:20:44] IS a binding back.
[1:20:49] Amen.
[1:20:51] it belonged to him BEFORE
[1:20:55] but the enemy became a squatter
[1:20:59] over that divine estate.
[1:21:04] So John 3:16
[1:21:07] is to a specific world
[1:21:10] that already had eternal life.
[1:21:18] HOW CAN YOU REDEEM
[1:21:20] THAT which is not redeemable?
[1:21:24] It doesn't have eternal life.
[1:21:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:33] You see, listen here. In the Smania
[1:21:36] church,
[1:21:38] the prophet says, "So, I'm speaking to
[1:21:42] you
[1:21:43] to gain the confidence
[1:21:46] and the knowledge of who you are
[1:21:50] that your redemption
[1:21:53] is not a probability of your choice.
[1:21:59] Oh, now I decided,
[1:22:01] now I fail. Now I decide.
[1:22:06] You see what I mean?
[1:22:10] Listen now. Then here we are coming to a
[1:22:15] conclusion.
[1:22:17] as the eternal log of ghost. God,
[1:22:21] eternal logos
[1:22:24] was manifest in the son
[1:22:29] and in Jesus
[1:22:31] throughout the fullness of the godheaded
[1:22:33] body.
[1:22:36] And that eternal one was the father
[1:22:41] manifest in flesh
[1:22:43] and thereby gained the title son.
[1:22:50] Okay. Even so WE
[1:22:54] eternal in his thoughts
[1:22:58] in our turn
[1:23:00] become the many membered spoken word.
[1:23:07] manifest in flesh.
[1:23:10] THE SON WAS THE father manifest in flesh
[1:23:15] and got the name or the title of the
[1:23:20] son. AND WE ALSO THAT ARE ETERNAL in his
[1:23:24] THOUGHTS
[1:23:28] in our tongue
[1:23:30] become many members spoken WORD. SEE
[1:23:36] MANIFESTING FLESH.
[1:23:38] WE ARE A BODY OF CHRIST.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Are you together WITH ME? AND THOSE
[1:23:48] ETERNAL THOUGHTS
[1:23:50] now manifest in flesh
[1:23:53] are sons of God.
[1:23:56] Even as we ARE SO CALLED,
[1:23:59] listen to what the prophet says here. WE
[1:24:02] DID NOT BECOME SEED
[1:24:04] BY THE REBIRTH.
[1:24:08] WE WERE SEED
[1:24:10] AND therefore were reborn.
[1:24:14] For only THE ELECT
[1:24:17] CAN be reborn.
[1:24:24] Praise the Lord. Because we WERE SE
[1:24:29] IS the reason we could be QUICKENED
[1:24:34] in name.
[1:24:37] There's nothing to quicken.
[1:24:42] How can you
[1:24:45] grow a stone?
[1:24:48] There's nothing in there to raise.
[1:24:52] We could be
[1:24:55] the same flesh,
[1:24:58] the same body,
[1:25:00] the same biology,
[1:25:02] but what matters
[1:25:04] is the seed at the center.
[1:25:08] That's what God deals with.
[1:25:15] THAT'S THE SEED
[1:25:17] THAT GOD TALKS TO.
[1:25:20] And the CONVERSION [screaming]
[1:25:23] is to that sea.
[1:25:27] We could all BE TAKEN
[1:25:30] for biological test
[1:25:35] and we are the same
[1:25:37] but we are not the same world
[1:25:41] by the CDG.
[1:25:46] So there MUST BE SOMETHING IN YOU
[1:25:50] TO QUICKEN.
[1:25:52] It's not your will
[1:25:55] that saves you. BUT GOD ACTIVATING your
[1:26:00] soul,
[1:26:03] but his sovereign grace.
[1:26:10] You don't just come and walk here.
[1:26:17] H my mom is not happy with me.
[1:26:21] Let me go sir. And you come here. You
[1:26:24] are not saved
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; by your will.
[1:26:32] Your will
[1:26:35] does not save you.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Your will.
[1:26:41] John 1:12.
[1:26:44] I think let us go there.
[1:26:54] He says, "But as many as received him
[1:27:03] received him,
[1:27:06] to them gave you power
[1:27:09] to become the sons of God,
[1:27:12] even to them
[1:27:14] that to them which believe on his name,
[1:27:20] which were born
[1:27:24] of blood,
[1:27:27] nor the will of the flesh,
[1:27:31] nor of the will of man,
[1:27:35] but God.
[1:27:40] Your will,
[1:27:43] you know, you can walk here.
[1:27:46] But redemption
[1:27:48] is something supernatural.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; John
[1:27:56] 113
[1:27:58] is not receiving doctrinal TRUTH
[1:28:05] about Christ, BUT RATHER
[1:28:10] coming into union
[1:28:13] WITH HIM.
[1:28:15] RECEIVED HIM.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; So the male
[1:28:28] comes into union
[1:28:30] with the female
[1:28:33] to produce a life.
[1:28:39] Are you the bride of Christ?
[1:28:42] For you to produce that life,
[1:28:45] there must be an invisible union.
[1:28:50] Amen. Amen. So when he talks of dying, I
[1:28:54] mean when he talks of dying for the
[1:28:57] word,
[1:28:59] he's not talking about this world.
[1:29:03] He's talking ABOUT YOU.
[1:29:06] AMEN.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; You are a different crowd.
[1:29:10] THAT'S WHY YOU DRESS DIFFERENT.
[1:29:13] That's why you believe different.
[1:29:16] THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T GO
[1:29:19] into places where EVERYBODY GOES
[1:29:24] because there IS SOMETHING IN YOU THAT
[1:29:26] KEEPS talking to you.
[1:29:29] Amen. That you are NOT SUPPOSED TO GO.
[1:29:33] YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. There
[1:29:35] is something WHICH IS YOUR SEED KING.
[1:29:40] ON THE INSIDE. IT GUIDES YOUR HUMAN
[1:29:43] spirit
[1:29:45] guides.
[1:29:48] AMEN. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU WOULD
[1:29:51] HAVE WANTED TO DO LIKE everybody else
[1:29:56] because your human spirit battles THE
[1:29:59] SPIRIT OF GOD.
[1:30:02] BUT YOU don't do them because on the
[1:30:04] inside there is a life WHICH SAYS NO.
[1:30:14] ARE you together with me?
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; So now IN 1 JOHN 2:15,
[1:30:23] he says, "Love not the world."
[1:30:30] And yet the scripture says, "God so love
[1:30:33] the world."
[1:30:36] So these are two different words.
[1:30:39] The one Jesus loved
[1:30:43] which WE ARE PART OF
[1:30:46] BUT THEN LOVE NOT THE WORLD.
[1:30:48] THE OTHER world he did die for.
[1:30:55] Love not the WORLD
[1:30:57] NEITHER THE THINGS
[1:31:00] that constitute this world.
[1:31:05] AMEN.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; IF ANY MAN LOVE THE WORLD,
[1:31:10] THE LOVE OF THE FATHER
[1:31:12] is not in him.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; So the world
[1:31:19] and the things
[1:31:21] that constitute this world
[1:31:24] will pass away.
[1:31:27] So don't love those things.
[1:31:30] DON'T SELL YOURSELF
[1:31:32] INTO THE THINGS OF THE WORLD.
[1:31:34] DON'T SELL YOURSELF
[1:31:37] IN THE POLITICS OF THIS WORLD. DON'T
[1:31:40] SELL YOURSELF IN THE ENTERTAINMENT OF
[1:31:43] THIS WORLD. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT
[1:31:46] KANE ESTABLISHED
[1:31:49] HAVE ANOTHER ED.
[1:31:52] But then John says
[1:31:55] don't love the feast
[1:31:58] THAT CONSTITUTE
[1:32:00] THE FALLEN [screaming] ONE.
[1:32:03] AMEN.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So now, brother Brennham says,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; the world here
[1:32:13] doesn't mean that the earth
[1:32:18] is typing doesn't mean that the earth.
[1:32:28] [laughter]
[1:32:29] The planet
[1:32:32] is going to pass away,
[1:32:35] but the WORLD
[1:32:38] cosmos
[1:32:42] cosmos,
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; THE POLITICS,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; THE SINNERS,
[1:32:49] THE SYSTEMS,
[1:32:51] SIN,
[1:32:52] DISEASE,
[1:32:54] GERMS,
[1:32:56] EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG
[1:32:59] WILL PASS AWAY.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE SAYS LOVE NOT this world,
[1:33:09] it doesn't mean the earth.
[1:33:13] Amen. AMEN. WHERE WE ARE, THE MOUNTAINS,
[1:33:18] the rivers, the plantations.
[1:33:21] No, he's saying DON'T LAUGH THE THINGS
[1:33:27] THAT MAKE the earth wicked.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; THE FASHIONS,
[1:33:37] LOVE NOT THE WORLD AND THE THINGS THAT
[1:33:40] ARE in the world.
[1:33:44] So verse 16,
[1:33:47] HE SAYS, "FOR ALL THAT'S IN THE WORLD,
[1:33:53] THE LUST OF THE FLESH,
[1:33:56] the lust of THE EYES,
[1:33:59] AND THE pride of life
[1:34:02] is not of the father,
[1:34:05] but is of the world.
[1:34:10] The last of the eyes
[1:34:21] should have it.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Noh.
[1:34:25] Praise the Lord. The pride of life.
[1:34:29] You deolve pride
[1:34:31] because you have attained a masters
[1:34:35] of
[1:34:36] degree.
[1:34:40] No, the pride of life.
[1:34:44] You know, you get pride
[1:34:47] because you got a new car.
[1:34:50] Remain the same. You
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the pride of life he says
[1:34:59] is not of the father but is of this
[1:35:01] world.
[1:35:03] You find a man lecturing about his car.
[1:35:10] You know this car here is different from
[1:35:12] these others you see. Okay they all
[1:35:15] Toyota but this one here has been
[1:35:18] upgraded
[1:35:20] now.
[1:35:24] He's trying to tell you
[1:35:26] I'm different.
[1:35:28] Don't compare me to you.
[1:35:33] He said the pride of life
[1:35:36] is not of Christ.
[1:35:39] So that type of character,
[1:35:42] the people that are composed in those
[1:35:45] things,
[1:35:48] they compete in fashions.
[1:35:51] He says, "Those are not the people that
[1:35:54] I died for.
[1:35:57] THE PEOPLE I DIED FOR,
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; THEY GO IN THE WORLD
[1:36:03] AND THEY SAY, "WHAT does God want?
[1:36:06] HOW can I dress?"
[1:36:09] Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE CHILDREN GOD DIED FOR,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; they cannot even have a DEBATE
[1:36:22] ABOUT FASHION BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE
[1:36:25] COMPROMISED
[1:36:28] because they look to the BRIDE
[1:36:31] that come from heaven WAS ADORNED.
[1:36:36] AMEN. WAS NOT HALF NAKED.
[1:36:41] LOWER LEVELS TO SHOW SOME PRESS
[1:36:46] COMPROMISE BECAUSE SHE COMES from the
[1:36:49] father.
[1:36:52] He says those are the world that I die.
[1:36:57] HE DIED TO REDEEM YOU FROM THAT
[1:37:01] TO bring you into the nature of THE
[1:37:03] BRIDE.
[1:37:05] AND WHEN YOU GET YOUR CHILDREN
[1:37:08] RIGHT FROM YOUTH.
[1:37:11] YOU TRAIN THEM HOW TO BE MODERATE in
[1:37:14] their dressing.
[1:37:18] Don't start saying
[1:37:28] create the nature of the WORLD
[1:37:32] that Christ died for in your family.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S NOT THE WORD CHRIST DIED FOR.
[1:37:43] HE died you know for his own world
[1:37:49] THAT DESCENDS FROM heaven
[1:37:53] adorned like the husband running for her
[1:37:55] husband.
[1:37:57] AMEN. BECAUSE THAT'S the only REASON
[1:38:02] why that Wow
[1:38:05] is in revelation.
[1:38:08] IT WAS REDEEMED.
[1:38:10] HE DIED FOR IT. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE
[1:38:13] THERE.
[1:38:16] THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN BE here
[1:38:20] on earth WHILE YOU ARE UP THERE IN
[1:38:24] HEAVENLY PLACES is because he died for
[1:38:26] you.
[1:38:30] Some of these things are impossible.
[1:38:34] We cannot TEACH THEM INTO YOU.
[1:38:37] IT IS ABOUT BEING THE SEED.
[1:38:43] AMEN. THAT YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE
[1:38:50] and you have a love for the world.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; You put in an effort.
[1:38:58] Amen. Amen. LABOR
[1:39:02] to enter into your rest.
[1:39:06] Amen. Amen. Because the DOOR HAS BEEN
[1:39:08] OPEN.
[1:39:10] So now labor
[1:39:13] is just walking to
[1:39:17] and remain in it.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So you know at the
[1:39:27] cross
[1:39:29] that's the world he redeemed.
[1:39:32] And you had the young people seeing here
[1:39:35] when he was dying on the cross
[1:39:38] I was on his mind.
[1:39:42] Cain was not in that mind.
[1:39:45] No sir, HE BROUGHT BACK ADAM'S REST
[1:39:50] that had sold their RIGHT
[1:39:54] by the devil. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE HE
[1:39:58] REDEEMS.
[1:40:02] Now you mean I can only sit
[1:40:06] and then I can be redeemed. If you sit
[1:40:10] and you are not reacting,
[1:40:13] amen to the voice of the mother eagle,
[1:40:18] then you are not an eagle.
[1:40:23] You see what I mean? If you are an
[1:40:25] eagle, you cannot sit quiet.
[1:40:29] AND THE MOTHER EGO IS calling you from
[1:40:32] the chicken back.
[1:40:38] When you preach like that, then the
[1:40:41] people will not respond to the word.
[1:40:45] No, even if you preach it,
[1:40:48] if they are not part of it, they are not
[1:40:51] part of it.
[1:40:55] KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
[1:40:58] YOU CAME FROM GOD and there will always
[1:41:01] BE A VOICE
[1:41:03] THAT SPEAKS to you. AND THE SCRIPTURE
[1:41:06] SAYS, "MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE.
[1:41:10] HE CARES IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN."
[1:41:15] HALLELUJAH. HE WILL NOT LET YOU GO OFF
[1:41:19] LIKE THAT. NO SIR. BECAUSE HE SPEAKS TO
[1:41:22] YOU FROM THE ANGLE OF YOU BEING
[1:41:26] RESPONSIBLE
[1:41:28] OF YOU HEARING HIS VOICE OF YOU
[1:41:31] ANSWERING back to the man.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:39] Listen after he died,
[1:41:43] just after he died,
[1:41:46] he said, "It is finished.
[1:41:50] IT IS FINISHED.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; PETER [screaming]
[1:41:53] MAY HAVE ALL THESE kind of troubles,
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; but when you are converted,
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; help your brethren.
[1:42:03] Peter, I see your troubles, but when you
[1:42:07] are converted because I see your name in
[1:42:11] the Lamb's book of life.
[1:42:18] Are you together with him?
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Peter had a LOT OF TROUBLES.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; BUT after he rose from the dead,
[1:42:28] Amen. The angel at the grave,
[1:42:32] he said, "Go and tell my DISCIPLES
[1:42:36] and Peter
[1:42:40] once a seed,
[1:42:43] always a seed. Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; There's no way you can become any seed.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; You'll always be a se.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Redemption
[1:42:59] is election.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; To be restored back,
[1:43:06] you'll have such a love
[1:43:09] for the word.
[1:43:12] Amen. Amen. You have such a love
[1:43:16] for the word.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; You see because you are seed
[1:43:24] you elected
[1:43:26] you come from God. You cannot stay home
[1:43:29] when there is a meeting here
[1:43:33] those things identify who you are.
[1:43:37] Amen. Amen.
[1:43:39] You cannot be seed
[1:43:41] and you are putting on transparent
[1:43:43] things.
[1:43:46] Those things identify who you are.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; I'm a seed.
[1:43:53] I'm elected.
[1:43:55] But I love this world and the things
[1:43:58] that are in the world. No,
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; take it. How you hear?
[1:44:11] He said, "It's finished."
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And I think I'll give you this wonderful
[1:44:17] scripture here
[1:44:20] in Hebrews chapter one.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; I do too.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; He says
[1:44:33] in Hebrews 3:1,
[1:44:38] Who being the brightness of his glory
[1:44:43] and the express image of his person
[1:44:51] and upholding all things
[1:44:54] by the by his power.
[1:44:58] When he had by himself packed our sins,
[1:45:04] sat down
[1:45:07] on the right hand of the majest.
[1:45:12] HE SAT DOWN. He had finished the work.
[1:45:18] BUT the old time priests,
[1:45:22] next time we shall talk about atonement,
[1:45:26] THE OLD TESTAMENT PRIESTS,
[1:45:28] THEY KEPT COMING back everywhere.
[1:45:31] They kept coming BACK EVERY YEAR. BUT
[1:45:34] THIS ONE he said it is finished
[1:45:38] and he sat.
[1:45:41] Amen. So
[1:45:43] this atonement
[1:45:46] does not expire
[1:45:49] like the old testament sacrifice
[1:45:52] that served forever.
[1:45:57] So when you are redeemed
[1:46:00] you are stepping it A FINISHED WORK.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU TOGETHER WITH ME?
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; And the blood,
[1:46:12] the prophet says, is always before him.
[1:46:17] And therefore, he only can see you
[1:46:21] through that shed blood
[1:46:27] atonement.
[1:46:29] So this atonement
[1:46:31] shall never LOSE ITS POWER
[1:46:34] TILL THE last person
[1:46:37] IS SAVED
[1:46:39] TO SEE no
[1:46:42] that power under the blood will always
[1:46:46] be present.
[1:46:52] Are you together with me church?
[1:46:56] Amen. Amen. Now
[1:46:58] We spoke about
[1:47:01] the vines.
[1:47:04] God speaks to both of them
[1:47:09] because they are two worlds.
[1:47:12] These two worlds are represented
[1:47:17] in the teaching of Christ.
[1:47:20] He speaks to both vers.
[1:47:25] He prophesies to both V.
[1:47:30] He speaks to the first V
[1:47:33] and then later on he would say but I
[1:47:37] have one thing against you.
[1:47:40] That one was to the false vine.
[1:47:44] So when you get into the world, you have
[1:47:48] to know what fine you are
[1:47:51] and also recognize
[1:47:54] AND REALIZE YOUR promise
[1:48:01] church.
[1:48:03] The prophet says, I have been saying
[1:48:07] RIGHT ALONE
[1:48:09] THAT THERE ACTUALLY two churches.
[1:48:12] THOUGH THE SPIRIT
[1:48:15] speaks to both of them in each age,
[1:48:20] to both of them
[1:48:24] as though they were but one.
[1:48:31] Are you together WITH ME? HE SPEAKS TO
[1:48:34] BOTH of them.
[1:48:36] As though they were one.
[1:48:41] NO.
[1:48:43] SO WHEN THE WORD IS PREACHED,
[1:48:46] LOOK AT WHO YOU ARE
[1:48:49] AND TAKE CARE
[1:48:51] OF HOW WE HEAR.
[1:48:56] Yes sir.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; He says these two worlds
[1:49:01] they are represented even in religion.
[1:49:05] Amen. YOU HAVE A TRUE VINE AND A FALSE
[1:49:09] VINE. THAT'S WHY HE SAYS THERE ARE THREE
[1:49:12] KINDS of believers in.
[1:49:18] So when you listen to the word,
[1:49:22] it will always be
[1:49:24] by what vine you are.
[1:49:29] You need to recognize
[1:49:32] as to what world you belong.
[1:49:36] When God speaks
[1:49:38] to the true vine, he speaks ATONEMENT
[1:49:44] and redemption.
[1:49:47] TO ATONE FOR YOUR SIN,
[1:49:51] redeem you. Amen.
[1:49:53] But to THE OTHER VINE, HE SPEAKS
[1:49:56] CONDEMNATION
[1:49:58] and judgment.
[1:50:02] So the vine
[1:50:05] he died for IS COVERED
[1:50:09] under his grace
[1:50:12] is under THE ATONEMENT.
[1:50:15] THEREFORE IT REPENTS.
[1:50:18] It grows and brings forth fruit.
[1:50:23] Amen. AMEN. BUT THE OTHER VINE
[1:50:27] MOVES further away from the word.
[1:50:33] Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; So the world he died for.
[1:50:42] I want you to make a confession.
[1:50:46] Turn to your brother
[1:50:48] to your sister and say, "I am the world
[1:50:52] he died for.
[1:50:56] The devil doesn't want to hear that
[1:51:03] he didn't die for everybody
[1:51:06] BECAUSE WHEN HE DIED,
[1:51:09] HE said it is finished.
[1:51:13] Which means that the ATONEMENT
[1:51:17] HAS BEEN DELIVERED. [screaming]
[1:51:20] THE REDEMPTION HAS BEEN DONE.
[1:51:25] SO THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN be redeemed
[1:51:29] and go to hell.
[1:51:33] WHEN YOU ARE REDEEMED,
[1:51:35] HE DOES ONE THING TO WORK ON YOU
[1:51:39] to make you into the image of his son.
[1:51:46] How can you go to hell with his life?
[1:51:53] So
[1:51:55] God speaks to both true and FALSE
[1:52:01] in every age. AND SUDDENLY HE
[1:52:05] THAT an ear that gets quickened.
[1:52:12] So all the teaching here
[1:52:15] the pastor is doing
[1:52:18] IS APPEALING TO HE THAT HAS AN EAR.
[1:52:25] AND HE THAT HAS AN EAR IS QUICKENED
[1:52:30] RESPONDS
[1:52:33] HIS VOICE.
[1:52:35] AND BECAUSE he has life,
[1:52:38] anything that has life grows.
[1:52:47] It grows.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; You see the people growing here.
[1:52:52] The addresses are getting higher up,
[1:52:57] higher up
[1:53:00] and going lower down.
[1:53:03] Signs of growth.
[1:53:05] He says, "But the other seed goes
[1:53:08] further away from the world."
[1:53:11] The more you preach, the shorter the
[1:53:14] dresses are, the tighter they become.
[1:53:18] Listen,
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; he says
[1:53:28] a son of God
[1:53:31] can go a long time
[1:53:36] before he recognizes
[1:53:38] that he's a son.
[1:53:43] THERE IS SOMETHING THAT BINDS HIM.
[1:53:48] He may BE HERE IN CHURCH
[1:53:51] BUT HE FEELS he cannot GO AWAY
[1:53:55] and he's in here. HE'S A SON OF GOD but
[1:54:00] you know HE TAKES A TIME
[1:54:03] SOMETIMES to break into
[1:54:07] the revelation
[1:54:09] that I'm a son of God.
[1:54:17] IN FACT,
[1:54:18] A LOT OF TRUE CHRISTIANS
[1:54:21] are like the story of the baby eagle
[1:54:27] that was hatched out and the head.
[1:54:31] You know that the eagle
[1:54:34] is a type of a true believer.
[1:54:39] So I I want to say something here.
[1:54:46] Brother Brham talks about the story of
[1:54:48] the mother eagle.
[1:54:52] The mother eagle had gone to feed
[1:54:56] and when he came back to the nest
[1:54:59] to count the eggs
[1:55:03] one was missing
[1:55:06] and he started hunting. He counted the
[1:55:10] days.
[1:55:12] He says, "If this egg was not eaten
[1:55:18] and taken by another strange bird
[1:55:25] in two weeks to hatch out,
[1:55:30] he started on a mission
[1:55:33] of looking
[1:55:35] for his little igllet.
[1:55:41] He would go over the chicken bar
[1:55:48] WINGS
[1:55:51] AND THE CHICKENS would scamper.
[1:55:55] They fear this big bird.
[1:56:01] Then
[1:56:03] he ended up in a certain area.
[1:56:09] And as usual,
[1:56:11] he would fly, [screaming]
[1:56:13] SCREAM,
[1:56:15] the mother's cry,
[1:56:22] [screaming]
[1:56:24] that's the kind of noise
[1:56:26] the igllet was making.
[1:56:29] And then the little chickens says, "We
[1:56:32] don't even understand this. There was
[1:56:34] brother.
[1:56:36] We don't understand it. It was in such a
[1:56:40] misery
[1:56:42] because he was eating
[1:56:45] what he was not supposed to eat. The
[1:56:48] chickens were comfortable scratching.
[1:56:52] But for him, he had clothes.
[1:56:56] When he scratches,
[1:56:58] he would dig deep.
[1:57:00] And deep down there, there was no food
[1:57:03] to pick.
[1:57:05] He suffered a lot.
[1:57:08] Then one day he had a familiar voice.
[1:57:14] [screaming]
[1:57:16] THEN HE SAID,
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; he said, "Hey Junior, [screaming]
[1:57:22] YOU ARE UP THERE DOWN
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; IN THE CHICKEN BARRIER."
[1:57:28] He said,
[1:57:30] HE SAYS, "NOW YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP
[1:57:33] HERE. HOW DO I DO IT?" THE MOTHER SAYS,
[1:57:37] "SPREAD YOUR WINGS."
[1:57:40] The man, THE LITTLE EAGLE SPREAD his
[1:57:43] wings. HE SAYS, "NOW, FLAP THEM." WHEN
[1:57:47] HE FLAPPED, HE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS A
[1:57:51] FOOT FROM THE GROUND.
[1:57:53] HE SAYS, "FLAP AGAIN. FLAP AGAIN. PUSH
[1:57:57] YOUR FEET HIGH.
[1:57:59] BEGIN TO S IN THE SKY.
[1:58:02] THE LITTLE EAGLE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS
[1:58:06] GOING AND GOING AND GOING, BUT FOR A
[1:58:10] LONG TIME HE HAD NOT REALIZED THERE WAS
[1:58:14] AN EGO.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; SO TODAY [screaming]
[1:58:19] COULD BE THE DAY THAT YOU REALIZE
[1:58:23] THAT indeed you are received GENOM
[1:58:27] AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY YOU ARE A
[1:58:30] CHRISTIAN IN CHURCH TODAY.
[1:58:36] It changes YOUR ATTITUDE.
[1:58:38] THE WAY YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF, THE WAY
[1:58:41] YOU PARTICIPATE IN CHURCH IS BECAUSE YOU
[1:58:44] DISCOVER you an ego.
[1:58:49] It changes YOU COMPLETELY.
[1:58:52] YOU BEGIN TO PAY YOUR TAX. YOU BEGIN TO
[1:58:55] DRESS DIFFERENT. YOU REJOICE AT THE
[1:58:58] PREACHING OF THE WORD BECAUSE you
[1:59:00] realize who you are.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:59:08] Sometimes you are struggling as a son.
[1:59:13] But our strength
[1:59:15] will come from knowing who we are
[1:59:19] and allowing God to give us the flight
[1:59:23] instructions.
[1:59:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He wants to drop the seed
[1:59:33] and drop in there.
[1:59:36] Praise God.
[1:59:37] AMEN. IN YOUR GOOD GROUND, HE BEGINS TO
[1:59:41] FREE
[1:59:43] THAT SEED ON THE INSIDE
[1:59:46] WITH THE WORD AND THAT SEED begins to
[1:59:49] grow. The eyes OF REVELATION,
[1:59:53] THEY BREAK OPEN.
[1:59:55] And then because your eyes are open,
[1:59:59] THERE are certain things you begin to do
[2:00:03] that you never did before.
[2:00:08] Because you realize who you are.
[2:00:12] Amen. Amen. You are now born again.
[2:00:16] How are you born again? First Peter 1:23
[2:00:22] He says, "Be born again,
[2:00:26] not of corruptible seed,
[2:00:30] but of incorruptible
[2:00:32] by THE WORD OF GOD, WHICH liveth and
[2:00:37] abideth forever.
[2:00:39] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. IT
[2:00:41] IS THE WORD IN YOUR GOOD GROUND
[2:00:46] live and abideth.
[2:00:52] WHATEVER DROPS IN THERE,
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; IT REMAINS IT HAS CERTAIN NUTRIENTS.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And then you BEGIN TO DEFORM
[2:01:04] IN THE END of those nutrients.
[2:01:07] AMEN. THEN AGAIN MORE COMES
[2:01:10] WITH DIFFERENT NUTRIENTS. YOU'RE GROWING
[2:01:13] THE ANGLE OF THOSE NUTRIENTS. YOU ARE
[2:01:16] GROWING dil because you've discovered
[2:01:19] who you are.
[2:01:23] So once THE ETERNAL SEED OF GOD'S WORD
[2:01:28] FALLS INTO THE GOOD GROUND,
[2:01:32] IT SURVIVES
[2:01:34] all nature of adversity.
[2:01:40] IT SURVIVE
[2:01:42] THE DARK AND COLD NIGHTS.
[2:01:47] IT SURVIVES.
[2:01:49] NOW THE COLD WINTERS
[2:01:52] IT SURVIVES
[2:01:54] THE WIRES [screaming] OF THE ENEMY.
[2:01:57] IT SURVIVES THE FALSE DOCTRINES
[2:02:01] BECAUSE SEED THE WORD WHICH IS IN THERE
[2:02:05] IS ETERNAL.
[2:02:09] The seed on this side feeding on the
[2:02:12] word. the word feeding on the word.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; It gives you strength
[2:02:23] to come forth.
[2:02:25] And even as you GET OUT HERE, you have
[2:02:29] got the ability to testify that I'm a
[2:02:32] son of God.
[2:02:35] That's our desire.
[2:02:38] So the seed
[2:02:40] on the inside feeds on the word.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; The word is the mito
[2:02:49] and you in there you are the feminine.
[2:02:54] And as long as you keep feeding
[2:02:57] then you are
[2:02:59] having union with the bride groom
[2:03:03] himself.
[2:03:05] Amen. you begin to grow from one level
[2:03:09] to another level. And if you don't know,
[2:03:16] you no longer struggle over certain
[2:03:18] things,
[2:03:21] you just don't know how you overcame.
[2:03:29] talking about children of God.
[2:03:33] And the prophet says they may take time
[2:03:37] to realize who they are,
[2:03:40] but when they do
[2:03:43] and they feed on the word, it changes
[2:03:46] their destiny.
[2:03:51] Are you together?
[2:03:52] Amen. Amen. Now, let's talk about this
[2:03:56] prodigal.
[2:03:58] Amen.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes
[2:04:02] when we are children, we do stupid
[2:04:06] things.
[2:04:10] They do stupid things
[2:04:13] and you don't even uh get upset because
[2:04:16] they are children.
[2:04:21] They break the cups.
[2:04:26] You know, my grandchildren tampered with
[2:04:28] my safe box and I can't open it.
[2:04:35] I can't open it.
[2:04:38] But they are children. They try to see
[2:04:42] grandpa does this
[2:04:44] and this thing opens.
[2:04:48] They are children.
[2:04:51] How many are children of God here?
[2:04:55] You do stupid things,
[2:04:58] but God doesn't throw you away.
[2:05:01] He wants to deal
[2:05:03] with that negative character.
[2:05:09] That's why
[2:05:12] the ministry
[2:05:14] is given to perfect
[2:05:17] the saints.
[2:05:20] Amen.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; They are children but imperfect.
[2:05:24] imperfect in a sense
[2:05:27] that you are not yet complete.
[2:05:31] There are certain things God still has
[2:05:34] to work on our lives. [snorts]
[2:05:39] Let's speak about this prodigal son
[2:05:42] who squandered his inheritance.
[2:05:46] You know, he was with his father and his
[2:05:50] father trained him and the boy was so
[2:05:53] good
[2:05:55] and he was raising his father's farm
[2:06:01] until it was top on the line
[2:06:05] and he came to a point and said,
[2:06:08] "Father,
[2:06:09] give me what belongs to.
[2:06:13] I want to go on the other side of the
[2:06:16] country and also raise my own.
[2:06:22] He's a son,
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; but he's stupid.
[2:06:27] Stupid.
[2:06:30] We are children. Sometimes we think we
[2:06:34] can't be able to succeed even away from
[2:06:38] his presence.
[2:06:43] And then we miss our services.
[2:06:47] Sometimes we don't study.
[2:06:50] Sometimes we don't listen to the
[2:06:52] message.
[2:06:53] We are just being stupid.
[2:06:56] We think we have picked enough
[2:06:59] to take us through the journey. That's
[2:07:02] what this boy thought.
[2:07:06] Do you know why you do that? You are
[2:07:08] just being a stupid child.
[2:07:11] A wise child will always live in the
[2:07:14] presence of his father.
[2:07:18] How important it is to stay in that
[2:07:21] presence.
[2:07:24] Find a time study.
[2:07:27] If you can find time,
[2:07:30] you can pray. Even when you are walking,
[2:07:34] you can pray. When you remember things,
[2:07:38] put them right. Even when you're on the
[2:07:40] street, father forgive me. That's the
[2:07:43] way to live in his presence.
[2:07:46] But this boy, he says, well, I can as
[2:07:50] well live on my own.
[2:07:53] And he went and squandered his
[2:07:56] inheritance.
[2:07:59] There was no more fruit left.
[2:08:04] The fruit of the spirit
[2:08:07] was completely drained away.
[2:08:11] No testimony
[2:08:13] whatsoever
[2:08:15] was left in the life of that man.
[2:08:18] But the scripture says when he came to
[2:08:21] himself
[2:08:24] that's what I'm saying. Selfreization
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; he came to himself. Amen.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know how far you've gone
[2:08:37] from the presence,
[2:08:40] but when you come to yourself,
[2:08:44] and I pray you come to yourself
[2:08:48] in this service,
[2:08:51] how far away
[2:08:53] have I gone from the presence?
[2:08:58] Because once a son,
[2:09:01] you are always a son.
[2:09:05] Because you are a son
[2:09:08] by a life
[2:09:10] and that life is eternal.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; So you need to come to yourself.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; That what THE SCRIPTURE SAYS when he
[2:09:24] came to himself.
[2:09:28] HE STARTED TO WALK AWAY from his
[2:09:31] backslide.
[2:09:36] HE HAD TO WALK.
[2:09:38] AND WHEN HE REACHED THERE, THE FATHER'S
[2:09:41] HEARTS
[2:09:43] WERE open to receive him back.
[2:09:47] I don't know how far YOU COULD HAVE GONE
[2:09:51] FROM THAT PRESENCE, BUT THE FATHER'S
[2:09:54] HEART WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN TO RECEIVE YOU
[2:09:58] BACK.
[2:10:00] AND WHEN YOU WALK BACK,
[2:10:02] THEN [screaming] YOU RECEIVE BACK the
[2:10:04] robe of righteousness.
[2:10:07] YOU RECEIVE BACK THE SHOES OF THE
[2:10:09] GOSPEL,
[2:10:12] THE RING OF AUTHORITY. HE RECEIVES YOU,
[2:10:16] LIFTS YOU TO PUT YOU BACK [screaming]
[2:10:19] IN THE POSITION OF a son
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; because he said it is finished.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? SO I WANT YOU
[2:10:32] TO COME BACK
[2:10:34] IN WHO YOU ARE
[2:10:37] AS A SON. NEVER GET TRAPPED.
[2:10:41] AMEN. NEVER GET TRAPPED.
[2:10:44] AMEN. INTO A sense of self judgment
[2:10:50] that therefore there's nothing good in
[2:10:52] me.
[2:10:54] CAIN WAS TRAPPED IN A SELF JUDGMENT.
[2:10:59] HE SAYS THEREFORE WHOEVER SEES ME SHALL
[2:11:03] KILL ME. NO, WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THE
[2:11:07] FATHER, [screaming]
[2:11:08] HE WILL RECEIVE YOU.
[2:11:11] That's what you NEED TO DO.
[2:11:17] AMEN.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the the prophet says.
[2:11:23] He says, "The new birth
[2:11:26] is Christ
[2:11:28] is the revelation."
[2:11:31] God has revealed to you. This
[2:11:36] great mystery,
[2:11:38] a child, and that's A NEW BIRTH.
[2:11:42] NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING to do
[2:11:45] when you get all that group together
[2:11:50] where the revelation is perfectly in
[2:11:53] harmony
[2:11:55] and God expressing it through his word
[2:12:01] by the same actions,
[2:12:04] the same things that he did
[2:12:07] making the word manifest.
[2:12:11] SO IF THE CHURCH
[2:12:13] ONLY KNEW its position,
[2:12:16] it will one day
[2:12:19] then the rapture will go
[2:12:24] when it knows what it is.
[2:12:30] Know who you are.
[2:12:32] when he came to himself.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; The reason why you find yourself
[2:12:41] away from the presence
[2:12:44] is because you are not with yourself.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Are you together with him?
[2:12:57] So I'm talking to the world he died for.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; You can stray,
[2:13:07] but the mother eagle
[2:13:10] never ceases to call.
[2:13:13] The good shepherd
[2:13:15] puts aside the 99
[2:13:18] to look for you.
[2:13:21] When you are,
[2:13:24] you realize you are lost.
[2:13:26] When you are sheep,
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; you realize [screaming]
[2:13:30] you are lost.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; And when the voice of the good shepherd
[2:13:38] speaks,
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; don't resist.
[2:13:44] Come back to the father.
[2:13:48] Amen. So I want to visit THE ELECT
[2:13:52] so that they may know who they are and
[2:13:56] that they are the world God died for.
[2:14:04] WHEN YOU AN ELECT,
[2:14:06] FAITH will be resource from knowing who
[2:14:08] you ARE
[2:14:12] and believing who you are and opting to
[2:14:16] WALK AS A SON.
[2:14:20] AMEN. YOU TAKE THE FIRST STEP.
[2:14:24] SPREAD YOUR WINGS.
[2:14:26] SPREAD THEM.
[2:14:29] SWING. FLAP THEM.
[2:14:32] FLAP THEM.
[2:14:35] WHEN THE CALL FOR REPENTANCE IS DONE,
[2:14:39] don't you start fighting.
[2:14:42] FLAP YOUR WINGS
[2:14:44] and run back to the father.
[2:14:47] Amen.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; You have to be certain of the father's
[2:14:51] love.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; So the world he died for
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; are the people that share in his gym.
[2:15:09] Those are the ones he died.
[2:15:11] You know when Eve FELL
[2:15:16] and was on the other side
[2:15:20] with the serpent
[2:15:22] Adam this way
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; could not imagine losing her.
[2:15:29] She had he had to walk over
[2:15:32] and get his wife back.
[2:15:38] Are you together with me? SO WHILE
[2:15:41] REDEMPTION
[2:15:43] IS God
[2:15:45] going YOUR WAY
[2:15:48] TO PICK YOU BACK.
[2:15:50] SO WHEN THE LORD ALLOWS
[2:15:53] WE ARE going to deal with this THING
[2:15:58] ABOUT ATONEMENT
[2:16:00] and redemption.
[2:16:03] You don't redeem what you never own.
[2:16:08] You redeem that which is yours.
[2:16:12] WHEN HE CAME DOWN, HE COME TO REDEEM
[2:16:16] seed gener.
[2:16:26] And I ALWAYS TOLD YOU THE BOOK IS THE
[2:16:29] MIND of the writer.
[2:16:32] HALLELUJAH. WHEN HE DIED ON THE CROSS, I
[2:16:35] WAS ON HIS MIND. I was in his book.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; So this
[2:16:46] THEY FULFILL GENESIS 1:28.
[2:16:49] They carry his IMAGE
[2:16:53] and they carry his LIKENESS
[2:16:57] but trapped under a fog.
[2:17:02] So he COMES AS THE LIGHT.
[2:17:06] HE SAYS, "I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD."
[2:17:10] WHEN YOU STEP INTO THAT PRESENCE,
[2:17:13] THEN THE FORM IS CLEARED BY THE LIGHT.
[2:17:18] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] THE LIGHT OF HIS
[2:17:20] WORD. YOU CANNOT COME UNDER THE
[2:17:23] INSTRUCTIONS OF THE WORD
[2:17:26] AND THE FOG DOESN'T CLEAR.
[2:17:29] IT WILL CLEAR.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And then you are GOING TO REALIZE
[2:17:37] THE LIKENESS
[2:17:39] AND THE IMAGE. YOU REALIZE YOU ARE A SON
[2:17:43] OF GOD. YOU REALIZE YOU COME FROM GOD
[2:17:49] AND YOU REALIZE YOU ARE RECORDED
[2:17:53] BOOK OF LIFE.
[2:17:55] AMEN. AND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LIVE
[2:17:58] HIS LIFE.
[2:18:01] AMEN.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; you know, needs you back.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Because he's building uh a new home for
[2:18:16] you.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, John 3:16
[2:18:26] is to this particular world.
[2:18:32] not another.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; So to this,
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; he gives them life.
[2:18:41] He gives.
[2:18:43] They don't go out there to take his
[2:18:47] life.
[2:18:48] He gives them
[2:18:51] as many as received it.
[2:18:54] He gives them his life. TO THEM HE GAVE
[2:18:58] POWER TO become sons of God.
[2:19:03] So to be sons OF GOD
[2:19:07] they've always been
[2:19:10] but he gives them power to manifest
[2:19:15] the sunship.
[2:19:18] He gives them power.
[2:19:20] They receive it.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. No man walks away, I mean
[2:19:25] walks unto him
[2:19:28] to take life because IT'S HIM who gives
[2:19:32] it. It's an election of grace.
[2:19:39] Amen.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; I said take heed
[2:19:46] how you hear.
[2:19:49] You know what we've heard
[2:19:52] for so many generations
[2:19:56] as organizations taught
[2:20:01] makes us think
[2:20:03] that you have got enough power
[2:20:06] to go and take eternal life.
[2:20:11] And sometimes we think
[2:20:14] you get it from the the altar here.
[2:20:19] No, you come here because you realize
[2:20:23] you have that life.
[2:20:28] SO TO REDEEM
[2:20:30] MEANS TO GET BACK
[2:20:33] AND atonement
[2:20:35] is the removing OF SIN
[2:20:38] THAT SEPARATES YOU WITH YOUR GOD.
[2:20:43] YOU ARE TURNED.
[2:20:46] SO redemption means
[2:20:48] TO RECOVER
[2:20:50] FROM THE power of ANOTHER
[2:20:55] TO BUY BACK.
[2:20:58] REDEMPTION
[2:20:59] IS Christ
[2:21:01] freeing men from the dominion of the
[2:21:03] Mosaic LAW
[2:21:08] by the price OF HIS DEATH.
[2:21:11] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SO AFTER HIS
[2:21:13] DEATH, HE SAYS IT'S FINISHED.
[2:21:17] SO LIFE CAN ONLY BE REDEEMED BY LIFE.
[2:21:23] The law could NOT REDEEM THEM.
[2:21:27] SO we are therefore redeemed
[2:21:29] AND THEN KEPT UNDER ATONEMENT
[2:21:33] by the BLOOD OF JESUS.
[2:21:36] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. WE
[2:21:38] ARE REDEEMED
[2:21:40] AND THEN WE KEEP UNDER ATONEMENT.
[2:21:43] BY THE BLOOD.
[2:21:46] AMEN.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament atonement
[2:21:53] meant TO COVER
[2:21:56] to pitch
[2:22:00] like in the making of the ARK
[2:22:02] [screaming]
[2:22:04] that was pitched by T.
[2:22:15] Amen. To cover the natural holes
[2:22:20] which was in the gopher wood
[2:22:24] that could let in the WATER
[2:22:28] BECAUSE THE ARK OF NOAH
[2:22:31] was made by the go
[2:22:35] which WAS NOT TOO HEAVY
[2:22:37] AND FIND A PROBLEM TO FLOAT.
[2:22:42] BUT THAT WOOD had wall holes pores.
[2:22:48] SO IT WAS NECESSARY
[2:22:50] AND IT WAS IMPORTANT
[2:22:52] THAT THEY COULD get the T
[2:23:00] so that they can completely COVER IT
[2:23:05] TO COVER THE HOLES.
[2:23:08] ARE YOU TOGETHER WITH ME? SO THAT MEANS
[2:23:12] THE GOPHER WOOD
[2:23:14] WAS REDEEMED
[2:23:16] FROM THE FOREST,
[2:23:19] SEPARATED
[2:23:21] and then atoned.
[2:23:28] Do you get that? Okay, let's go into the
[2:23:31] ark the message.
[2:23:33] the prophecies. Notice another thing
[2:23:37] that the word meant
[2:23:41] MEANING ATONEMENT
[2:23:43] WHEN IT SAID
[2:23:45] PITCH IT
[2:23:48] TIE IT
[2:23:51] or soak it with resin.
[2:23:55] It means to atone.
[2:23:59] Now the WORD PITCH
[2:24:02] MEANS TO ATONE.
[2:24:04] IN LEVITICUS,
[2:24:06] THE SAME WORD THAT was used for pitch in
[2:24:11] Genesis
[2:24:13] in Leviticus
[2:24:15] used as an ATONEMENT
[2:24:19] to make AN ATONEMENT.
[2:24:22] THE TONE IS TO STAND BETWEEN.
[2:24:26] AND THE pitch that was in THE GO WOOD
[2:24:30] IN THE ARK WAS TO KEEP OUT
[2:24:35] WAS TO ATONE THE BELIEVER
[2:24:38] FROM THE WRATH of the water.
[2:24:42] ATON,
[2:24:45] REDEEMED [screaming]
[2:24:46] FROM THE WORLD AND ATONED
[2:24:51] AWAY THE LIFE UNDER the blood.
[2:24:55] HALLELUJAH. TO COVER THE HOLES
[2:24:59] OF YOUR WEAKNESS, OF YOUR FAILURES. IT
[2:25:02] REQUIRES THE LIFE
[2:25:05] UNDER THE [screaming] BLOOD CREATOR.
[2:25:12] Praise the Lord. In the Old Testament,
[2:25:15] THE CHEMISTRY
[2:25:19] WAS THE ATONEMENT. BUT IN THE NEW
[2:25:21] TESTAMENT, THE ATONEMENT IS THE VERY
[2:25:25] LIFE OF CHRIST TO COME IN AND TAKE CARE
[2:25:29] OF OUR POWERS.
[2:25:33] The Holy Spirit
[2:25:36] comes to maintain
[2:25:40] your redemption.
[2:25:42] Amen. Amen.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; SO THE SPIRIT HIMSELF
[2:25:46] TAKES CARE
[2:25:48] of our humanity.
[2:25:54] Okay. In Hebrews, the book, not the
[2:25:58] Bible
[2:26:00] 7 part two,
[2:26:04] he says you'll appreciate that you love
[2:26:07] it. If you are a Christian to a place
[2:26:11] that sin
[2:26:13] to a place that sin would haunt you
[2:26:20] if you're a real Christian to a place
[2:26:25] that sin would haunt you
[2:26:28] till you couldn't do it.
[2:26:30] For the seed of God remains in you and
[2:26:35] he cannot sin. The Bible said once
[2:26:39] purged by the blood of Jesus,
[2:26:43] you have no more desire for sin.
[2:26:47] If you have a desire, your heart is not
[2:26:49] right with God.
[2:26:52] That's when you say, "Father of my son."
[2:26:57] Amen. He now says, "Now you will do
[2:27:01] wrong,
[2:27:03] but you don't do it willfully.
[2:27:07] YOU ARE TRAPPED
[2:27:10] and anything YOU ARE TRAPPED INTO
[2:27:13] SOMETHING that you don't mean to do
[2:27:16] is not seen yet
[2:27:19] because you repent
[2:27:21] the mean you see
[2:27:25] that you are doing wrong.
[2:27:28] You turn quickly and say I didn't mean
[2:27:33] to do that. YOU WILL SAY THAT ALL YOUR
[2:27:36] LIFE
[2:27:38] a man don't want to be.
[2:27:43] That's the reason that we are so STUPID
[2:27:47] AND SHOWING THAT DOWN HERE ON EARTH THAT
[2:27:51] THERE is a blood atonement for US
[2:27:55] all the time to keep us covered.
[2:28:01] Amen.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; He says when you do
[2:28:06] father have my support
[2:28:10] father wash
[2:28:13] ask for more
[2:28:18] to cover that power.
[2:28:21] Amen. Amen. So we are not saved today
[2:28:29] lost tomorrow.
[2:28:32] and saved again.
[2:28:34] We are saved once
[2:28:39] but [laughter] kept
[2:28:41] by the atonement.
[2:28:44] SAVED BY GRACE, [screaming]
[2:28:47] maintained by the blood.
[2:28:53] The blood is always there waiting for
[2:28:57] our confession.
[2:29:01] The life of the atonement
[2:29:03] keeps us under daily sacrifice.
[2:29:08] Amen. Amen.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; Let me give you this quote. I'm trying
[2:29:12] to find where to finish.
[2:29:16] He says, "A sinner is a sinner.
[2:29:21] He does not commit sins.
[2:29:28] He's a sinner. That's his nature. But
[2:29:32] you, you are the one who sins
[2:29:36] because that's your not your nature.
[2:29:39] He says, "But the church commits a sin,
[2:29:46] does wrong,
[2:29:48] gets a wrong thought, wrong impression,
[2:29:52] makes scrapples,
[2:29:56] wobbles like a little child walking,
[2:29:59] trying to learn how to walk.
[2:30:02] We just don't know how to walk good yet
[2:30:07] because a little boy, BUT WE HAVE A HAND
[2:30:12] THAT REACHES DOWN,
[2:30:14] gets us to steady us.
[2:30:22] We have one hand
[2:30:24] which holds us
[2:30:27] to help us
[2:30:29] to stop staggering.
[2:30:31] That is your growth.
[2:30:36] Father, I used to stagger
[2:30:38] but now I don't stagger. Will you say
[2:30:40] that this morning?
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; You are A CHILD OF GOD. DON'T PUT A self
[2:30:47] condemnation ON YOU.
[2:30:50] DON'T SEEK
[2:30:51] TO STAY UNDER THE ATONEMENT.
[2:30:55] The blood is there for you.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why at every redemption
[2:31:04] the people were moved to worship
[2:31:09] because it's Christ who pitched their
[2:31:12] wickedness.
[2:31:15] Are you together with me? They worshiped
[2:31:19] because of the redemption. THEY HAD NO
[2:31:22] POWER TO redeem themselves.
[2:31:26] SO AT EVERY REDEMPTION,
[2:31:29] THE PEOPLE WORSHIPED.
[2:31:32] Look at Miriam and the women symbolic of
[2:31:36] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:31:39] AFTER THEY CROSSED OVER, they worshiped.
[2:31:43] Who are we to have brought Pharaoh
[2:31:49] to I mean drown under the water?
[2:31:53] They lift up their hands.
[2:31:56] Who am I? Who was a prostitute? Who am
[2:31:59] I? Who was a drunkard?
[2:32:02] Redemption produces worship.
[2:32:08] It produces worship.
[2:32:11] Are you together with me? If it was our
[2:32:14] work,
[2:32:18] brother Steven, you would start
[2:32:20] bragging.
[2:32:27] You see me? Uhhuh. Uhhuh.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; It takes away
[2:32:33] the requirement
[2:32:36] of worship for the atonement.
[2:32:42] We worship because who are we to walk
[2:32:46] above sin?
[2:32:48] Who are we that when we sin we can be
[2:32:52] forgiven?
[2:32:55] You see what I mean? Okay, let's go to
[2:32:57] Exodus here and see the worship of
[2:33:00] Miriam
[2:33:02] in Exodus 15
[2:33:05] verse 20. And Miriam the prophetess
[2:33:12] the SISTER OF IRON
[2:33:14] TOOK a temporal in her hand
[2:33:18] and THE WOMEN
[2:33:21] WENT OUT AFTER HER.
[2:33:23] THE TEAM ROSE and with dances
[2:33:27] and answered them saying, "SING YOU TO
[2:33:30] THE LORD,
[2:33:32] FOR HE HAS triumphed [screaming]
[2:33:34] gloriously
[2:33:36] the host and HIS
[2:33:39] BROUGHT DOWN INTO THE SEA.
[2:33:42] ARE YOU TOGETHER WITH HALLELUJAH GLORIFY
[2:33:46] THE LORD? FOR I WAS A DRUNKER.
[2:33:50] SEE WHAT I AM. I WAS A WITCH AND SEE
[2:33:54] WHAT I AM. YOU LIFT UP YOUR HANDS AND
[2:33:57] SAY WHO AM I TO BE REDEEMED TODAY.
[2:34:04] So we will not wait
[2:34:07] for the doors TO OPEN
[2:34:10] BECAUSE WE ARE THANKFUL
[2:34:13] FOR the glory of redemption.
[2:34:16] Amen. And the bride in Revelation 5
[2:34:22] WORSHIPED AFTER THE REVELATION OF
[2:34:24] ATONEMENT.
[2:34:28] AMEN. YOU SEE JOHN WORSHIPING
[2:34:32] BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN REDEEMED AND HE SAYS
[2:34:35] THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL THAT'S
[2:34:38] IN THERE HAD ME JOIN
[2:34:43] HIS NAME'S
[2:34:45] OF LIFE. THAT WAS REDEMPTION.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? And then WHEN
[2:34:52] YOU GET DOWN TO REVELATION 15,
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. They see, YOU KNOW, ALL the
[2:35:00] sea of glass mingled with fire.
[2:35:05] Only this one we shall read.
[2:35:08] Let's go to Revelation 15
[2:35:11] verse two. Praise God. Redemption is
[2:35:15] supernatural.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Is God
[2:35:22] recovering his seed deed?
[2:35:27] AND WHEN YOU REALIZE
[2:35:30] WHERE HE PICKED YOU FROM,
[2:35:32] THEN THE PRAISE, then the worship. IT'S
[2:35:36] NOT HE THAT RUNTH
[2:35:38] OR HE THAT WE BUT GOD WHO SHOWS MERCY
[2:35:43] THEN THE worship
[2:35:45] and the praise.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 15:2,
[2:35:55] "And I saw as it were
[2:35:58] a sea of glass
[2:36:00] mingled with fire,
[2:36:03] and them that had gotten the victory
[2:36:07] over the beast, and over his image, and
[2:36:11] over his mark,
[2:36:14] and over the name of his name,
[2:36:16] stand on the sea of glass,
[2:36:20] having hearts of God,
[2:36:23] Hallelujah.
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:36:32] [screaming]
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; They had overcome the antichrist.
[2:36:37] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. ALL THOSE THAT
[2:36:39] WERE REDEEMED
[2:36:42] and they sung the song of Moses,
[2:36:45] THE SERVANT OF GOD, THE SONG OF THE LAMB
[2:36:50] AND MARVELOUS
[2:36:52] AND THY WORKS. LORD GOD ALMIGHTY
[2:36:56] TRUE AND THY WAYS. Thou king of the
[2:37:01] sight.
[2:37:03] Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD.
[2:37:04] [screaming]
[2:37:05] THE SEA OF GLASS.
[2:37:08] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THIS IS THE
[2:37:10] REPRESENTATION
[2:37:12] OF THE PRESENT ALTAR
[2:37:14] WHERE THE SACRIFICE
[2:37:17] WAS LAID. HALLELUJAH.
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; AND THESE PEOPLE HERE IS STANDING ON THE
[2:37:23] SEA OF GLASS.
[2:37:25] THANK GOD [screaming]
[2:37:26] FOR THAT.
[2:37:32] AND THEY GLORIFIED GOD. THEY SANG THE
[2:37:34] SONG OF MOSES. YOU SUNG THE SONG OF THE
[2:37:37] LAMB GLORIFYING [screaming] GOD FOR THE
[2:37:41] ATONEMENT. WON'T YOU WORSHIP HIM
[2:37:43] TONIGHT?
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; WON'T YOU THANK HIM THAT YOU ARE
[2:37:47] REDEEMED?
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU TO BRING YOURSELF ON THE SEA
[2:37:52] OF GALILEE? IT IS THE HAND of grace.
[2:37:57] God bless you. God bless you. IS THE
[2:38:00] HAND OF GRACE THAT FINALLY BRINGS US AT
[2:38:05] THE SEA OF GALILE. HALLELUJAH.
[2:38:08] HALLELUJAH. AND THE REFLECTION
[2:38:10] OF THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVAH BEING SEEN
[2:38:14] THROUGH YOU.

[2:38:20] BY POWER, NOT BY STRENGTH.
[2:38:26] God bless you. God bless you, brother
[2:38:28] Moses.
[2:38:30] you love him. That's the atonement
[2:38:33] THE WORLD that he DIED FOR. HE MAKES
[2:38:37] SURE THAT they'll make it.
[2:38:41] God bless you.

[2:38:51] Redeemed I love to proclaim
[2:38:56] it. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
