[17:41] shall go forth into captivity and the
[17:43] residue of the people shall not be cut
[17:46] off from the city
[18:15] then shall the Lord go forth and fight
[18:18] against those Nations as when he fought
[18:20] in the day of battle
[18:31] and it shall come to pass verse six in
[18:34] that day that the light shall not be

[19:41] important so we've read from the book of
[19:46] Zariah about the day of the
[19:49] Lord amen and the Bible says it shall
[19:54] come to pass in that
[19:56] day that the light shall not be
[20:01] clear
[20:03] nor praise the Lord but it shall be one
[20:08] day we shall be known to the
[20:12] Lord nor day nor
[20:15] night but it shall come to
[20:18] pass that at
[20:21] evening at evening

[20:38] word stay true and faithful to God's
[20:45] word praise the Lord for God has
[20:48] promised us that there shall come a
[20:52] day and in that day it shall not be day
[20:57] nor night
[20:59] but the assurance that we have in that
[21:03] day praise the lord we know that it
[21:06] shall be the day of the
[21:08] Lord and in that day it shall be an
[21:12] evening time and in that evening
[21:15] time it shall be
[21:18] light amen the light that shall shine
[21:25] hope upon those that wait upon the Lord
[21:30] the light that brings
[21:32] hope to those that have been waiting for
[21:35] the day of the
[21:38] Lord praise the name of the Living God
[21:41] the light that brings
[21:43] life to the souls that are waiting upon
[21:47] the
[21:48] Lord in the evening
[21:51] time after the Lord has fought the
[21:55] Battle and it is all w
[21:58] of the evening

[22:04] prepare the coming of the
[22:07] Lord that light praise the Lord prepare
[22:13] us It
[22:15] prepares the faithful It
[22:18] prepares those that are waiting upon the
[22:22] Lord do have the Hope waiting in
[22:26] expectation for the coming of the Lord
[22:30] that light shall shine hope upon
[22:34] them that is the light of a
[22:37] confirmation that the day of the Lord is
[22:40] come praise the Lord so stay true and
[22:45] faithful to the hope that we have
[22:48] received to the hope that we have
[22:50] received in the
[22:52] word praise the Lord when when in the
[22:56] book of second Timothy CH 2:15
[23:00] the Bible says St to show yourself
[23:02] approved unto
[23:06] God a Workman that needes not to be
[23:12] ashamedly dividing the word of
[23:16] Truth praise the Lord instructing us to
[23:21] study the
[23:23] word praise the Lord so we come into the
[23:26] full knowledge of the Revelation and of
[23:31] God to help us to get into the
[23:36] truth to show yourself approved unto
[23:41] God a Workman that need not to be
[23:47] ashamed amen that does not need to be
[23:51] ashamed but rightly dividing the word of
[23:55] Truth
[23:59] raise the living B so how do we stay
[24:02] true to the word of
[24:04] God how do we stay faithful to the word
[24:07] of
[24:08] God as we are waiting upon the coming of
[24:11] the
[24:12] Lord which we know it is at
[24:15] hand how do we stay
[24:18] faithful and true to the word of God the
[24:22] say study to show yourself approved unto
[24:26] God
[24:29] what should we study the word of God
[24:33] praise the name Living God this is the
[24:36] light that we have in the evening
[24:39] time the revelation of the word of God
[24:43] for our
[24:45] day it is the light that illuminates our
[24:49] path it is the light that shineth upon
[24:52] our
[24:54] faith to give us the Hope praise the
[24:58] Lord
[24:59] for that that we are waiting for the
[25:02] coming of the Lord the day of the Lord
[25:06] study the word study the message have a
[25:10] continuous
[25:12] fellowship with the Holy Spirit praise
[25:15] the Lord so that you you study and show
[25:18] yourself approved
[25:22] God so now when we
[25:25] practice that which we have have
[25:29] believed in studying the word and
[25:33] remaining in fellowship with
[25:35] God praise the Lord that is the
[25:39] Revelation praise the Lord that shines
[25:42] hope upon our
[25:45] faith for the day of the Lord to have
[25:48] the faith to believe that we are living
[25:51] in the days of the coming of the
[25:55] Lord praise the Living God
[26:12] amen
[26:18] am amen as you wait for another mic
[26:22] let's start the book of Psalms 23
[26:30] verse
[26:33] 6 the Bible
[26:36] says surely goodness and mercy shall
[26:41] follow me all the days of my life and I
[26:44] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[26:51] forever 23:6
[27:14] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[27:16] me all the days of my life and I will
[27:19] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[27:28] the that's the Revelation that David
[27:32] received about the
[27:34] secret of staying
[27:37] through staying in the word of
[27:40] God he says goodness and mercy shall
[27:42] follow me all the days of my
[27:46] life and I will dwell in the house of
[27:50] the Lord
[27:52] forever praise the Lord so now I want us
[27:55] to look at a few characters
[27:58] of men and
[28:00] women who have stood true to the word of
[28:04] God who have been faithful to the word
[28:07] of
[28:08] God right from the Old Testament so we
[28:12] notice a number of
[28:14] characters who plac their
[28:17] lives as a stepping
[28:20] stone for Glory of the kingdom of
[28:24] God and never sympathized
[28:28] praise the Lord with
[28:31] themselves with what surrounded
[28:33] them not even the failures around
[28:37] them that did depart them from the
[28:41] words no
[28:43] frustration theyed their
[28:46] attention not even
[28:48] sickness not even betroyal
[28:51] stood in their way with
[28:54] God praise the Lord and we want see the
[28:57] real
[28:59] that God has for those that stay true
[29:02] and faithful to his
[29:06] word praise the Living God so we have a
[29:13] man a blessed man blessed of the
[29:18] Lord committed himself to the services
[29:20] of
[29:22] God faithful and
[29:25] sincere praise the Lord then we
[29:29] notice that despite his
[29:33] faithfulness there was a tragedy that H
[29:36] the house of
[29:39] job praise
[29:41] the so now when it hit the house
[29:45] of this does not mean that God was not
[29:48] present with
[29:51] job God was still present and watching
[29:54] over
[29:56] job we know what scripture tells us
[29:59] about we know that it is God who allowed
[30:05] Satan to come and attack
[30:08] job why because God was very
[30:12] sure who job was before
[30:17] him job was a faithful
[30:20] servant job was a man who had been
[30:23] tested and he was found
[30:26] faithful noticed that job had received
[30:32] a an
[30:34] assurance of what he had
[30:37] believed and what he stood for praise
[30:41] the Lord so we noticed that the devil
[30:44] came
[30:45] and that he wanted to attack him and God
[30:49] let him be so he went and attacked him
[30:54] so he attacked his children he attacked
[30:56] his CLE
[30:58] he attacked his ship he attacked his
[31:02] flock he attacked even the church where
[31:05] job was
[31:07] Fellowship that even the people that
[31:09] were
[31:11] surrounding began to uh to doubt him and
[31:15] they thought maybe
[31:17] somehow could have been a silent
[31:21] sinner praise the Lord everyone else
[31:24] rejected
[31:25] him even his own wife
[31:28] asked
[31:30] him to reject God so you could die and
[31:34] get free from the pain that he was going
[31:37] through now job was a sincere
[31:41] man praise the Lord he was sincere to
[31:44] the
[31:45] cause he was sincere to
[31:48] God he was a
[31:51] Believer and not even
[31:54] [Music]
[31:55] tragedy not even the suffering
[31:59] not even all the battles around
[32:02] him get him out of the presence of
[32:08] God nothing kept him but the word which
[32:12] he had
[32:14] believed praise the Lord nothing kept
[32:17] job praise the Lord job had been locked
[32:20] in the
[32:22] word when he believed this
[32:25] word praise the Lord came in Union with
[32:28] the
[32:29] word praise the Lord and when he came in
[32:32] Union with the word he was
[32:35] convinced the word which he believed so
[32:38] now when he con was
[32:40] convinced he was faithful to the
[32:43] word and he kept the word the B says
[32:48] Jesus he told us that those that are
[32:52] faithful and keep his
[32:54] judgments and keep his Commandments and
[32:58] keep his words what did he say he said
[33:02] he and the father will come and make
[33:06] their AB in
[33:07] him when believed the words and he got a
[33:11] hold of the words praise the Lord the
[33:14] word became part of him and became part
[33:18] of the word so he could not be
[33:21] separated not even by the
[33:24] sickness that he was going through
[33:27] praise the Lord
[33:28] the Bible tells us in the Book of Romans
[33:32] I think it's verse
[33:34] 8 verse
[33:36] 31 there is
[33:38] nothing when a man or a woman has come
[33:43] into that
[33:45] countenance has come into that
[33:49] presence the presence of God and that
[33:53] man has
[33:55] stood sure of his calling
[33:58] praise the Lord and he has recognized
[34:01] who he is in the
[34:02] word and you become a part of the word
[34:06] which you have believed there is nothing
[34:10] that can attempt to come in between you
[34:14] and your
[34:15] God why because you have the
[34:19] Assurance praise the Lord something that
[34:23] convinces
[34:24] you that there is no other better place
[34:27] to be
[34:29] the word of God praise the Lord so not
[34:32] even
[34:33] sickness can stand in the way the word
[34:36] of
[34:37] God stood
[34:39] firm not even the
[34:42] sickness the cancer that was eating up
[34:46] his
[34:47] stand in his way with God praise the
[34:51] Lord he rejected everything
[34:53] else and he stood firm with the word
[34:58] praise the Lord so now regardless of the
[35:01] weaknesses praise the Lord he might have
[35:04] been weak here and
[35:05] there but he
[35:08] stood praise the Lord time he felt he
[35:11] was
[35:12] weak he got back to worship he got back
[35:16] to the word he got back to God what does
[35:19] that teacher praise the lord we shall
[35:22] become weak at some
[35:24] point and our strength failed
[35:27] praise the Lord but now we have the word
[35:31] we have the Assurance our strength is
[35:35] not drawn from anything else from the
[35:39] word of God so when we fail our strength
[35:44] fail
[35:45] Us Praise the Lord when do we have to
[35:48] run run back to the word of
[35:51] God praise the name of the living so now
[35:55] job always R back to the word
[35:59] praise the Lord such a man is a man who
[36:03] stood true and faithful to the
[36:07] word he had believed praise the Lord so
[36:12] many of them we have Abraham we have
[36:16] David Daniel we
[36:19] have we have Ruth Elijah all those are
[36:24] Gan soldiers
[36:27] talk about Paul a vibrant
[36:31] man praise the Lord who thought himself
[36:36] nothing without
[36:38] Jesus praise the Lord and he said for
[36:41] him to
[36:42] live has to be Jesus praise the Lord for
[36:46] you to live it has to be Jesus you
[36:50] cannot live without him he is our
[36:54] strength he is our courage
[36:59] praise the Lord so now when our faith
[37:01] fail us when our strength fail us let us
[37:06] run back to
[37:07] Jesus that's where we draw our
[37:10] strength praise the Living God join the
[37:15] Divine tested
[37:19] persed but stood true to the
[37:22] word which he had received not because
[37:26] he was so powerful
[37:28] not because they were so different from
[37:30] the rest of
[37:31] us but he was
[37:34] decided he had found a soless in the
[37:38] word found his position in the
[37:41] word and he was ready to give it all
[37:45] that
[37:46] required to preach Christ and to live
[37:49] for
[37:50] Christ when you find your
[37:53] position in the words you do whatever it
[37:56] takes
[37:58] to leave for the word praise the Lord
[38:01] you are not ashamed of the
[38:03] word regardless of how the environment
[38:06] has
[38:08] become but you stand true to the word
[38:11] praise the Lord you stand Faith the
[38:16] testimony you are carrying the testimony
[38:19] of Jesus
[38:21] Christ God wants such a
[38:24] man this
[38:25] generation that will
[38:28] and show themselves approved of the
[38:32] words to car the
[38:35] testimony that there is still a
[38:38] Christian that believes and lives by the
[38:42] word a living
[38:44] epe in this dying
[38:48] generation praise the Lord
[38:51] Satan is not
[38:53] seated Satan has always been on a hand
[38:58] in your Testament he was always on a
[39:01] hand that's why he came around moving
[39:06] around likeing
[39:08] lion and now when he saw job he wanted
[39:11] to get a hold of him he is not
[39:15] resting he still moving
[39:18] around we have one
[39:21] Assurance you have
[39:23] believed praise the lord we have been
[39:25] studying about the new birth
[39:28] if you have that
[39:30] confirmation and you have that
[39:32] Assurance of the new
[39:35] birth the life of God in
[39:38] you praise the Lord when you have that
[39:42] Assurance you have that
[39:45] seal praise the Lord even when the Devil
[39:48] comes
[39:49] around with wild
[39:51] doctr with all kinds of
[39:54] enticements with all kinds of attacks
[39:58] your soul has been locked together with
[40:00] the
[40:02] words by that
[40:04] seal because of that seal you have the
[40:07] Assurance of your
[40:10] Victory praise the Living God when the
[40:13] Devil comes he will come and he will Ro
[40:16] up but you are still locked in the hands
[40:20] of
[40:21] God and he's not giving up on us praise
[40:25] the lord the devil will come
[40:28] he will hit he will hit us in different
[40:32] ways as long as we have the
[40:35] Assurance of the word we have the
[40:38] assurance that our lives is not us
[40:42] anymore but Christ that lives in us so
[40:46] when the Devil comes to hit us up we
[40:49] still rise up
[40:50] knowing that we have he that lives in
[40:54] US is greater and more stronger than our
[40:56] weak
[40:59] failures so we have the assurance that
[41:03] anyhow shall make it to the
[41:06] end because the seal that we have the
[41:10] Bible says the seal that he gives
[41:12] us after he has drawn us to
[41:16] himself remember the Bible says faith
[41:19] comes by
[41:21] hearing hearing by the word of God Jesus
[41:25] say no man comes
[41:28] unless the father
[41:30] draws the Lord so all
[41:33] alone we have God gues us through
[41:38] the he called
[41:40] us and now he positioned
[41:43] Us in the words he works upon us until
[41:47] we are ready for his
[41:50] service he gives us the new bir he gives
[41:54] us the Holy Spirit which is our seal
[41:58] as long as that seal is there as long as
[42:01] that token is there there is nothing
[42:04] that shall separate us from the love of
[42:07] God there is nothing that shall separate
[42:10] us from the words praise the Lord the
[42:14] Bible says not even
[42:17] sickness not even trials not Temptation
[42:21] not even suffering not things
[42:25] present things to come
[42:28] why because we have the
[42:30] assurance that we have the seal the life
[42:33] of God in our
[42:35] lives that seal has the power to protect
[42:39] us that seal has the power to guard you
[42:44] from the elments of evil praise the Lord
[42:48] and sometimes you get weak but when you
[42:52] get weak remember that the token is
[42:55] there
[42:57] when the devil hits you down you
[43:00] remember that the token is there you
[43:03] raise up and claim your position in the
[43:08] world praise the Living God he called us
[43:11] to
[43:12] himself because he called us to
[43:15] himself he gave us a seal which is our
[43:19] protection until the day of our
[43:22] Redemption not tomorrow not today but
[43:27] till the
[43:28] day of our Redemption so how do we stay
[43:32] true to the word how do we stay faithful
[43:35] to the
[43:36] word it is not your
[43:39] obligation it is his obligation to guide
[43:42] you in his
[43:43] word praise the Lord so what do we have
[43:46] to do we just have to
[43:49] surrender and be obedient to the
[43:52] leadership of the Holy Spirit praise the
[43:56] name of living God
[43:57] so now we have these men
[43:59] here talk about Moses praise the Lord
[44:04] when he was given a Great
[44:07] Commission a
[44:08] commission to lead the children of
[44:11] God from Egypt praise the Lord From A
[44:16] Land of
[44:17] Confusion from a land full of
[44:20] fil the land of
[44:23] suffering to the land of freedom
[44:27] but it was not an easy
[44:29] Road it was not an easy
[44:32] way found so many
[44:35] obstacles but
[44:37] remember God first worked upon
[44:41] Him Praise the Lord for the days the
[44:45] years worked upon him now he brings him
[44:49] to
[44:50] commission for the service of the Lord
[44:53] remember we've been dealing with that
[44:55] subject in the Sunday School
[44:58] when God calls us
[45:00] out he's not calling us to stay he's
[45:04] calling us for a
[45:06] service is calling you for a
[45:08] service praise the Lord he calls you and
[45:11] then he begins to
[45:13] work praise the Lord transform your life
[45:17] to align with his
[45:19] life praise the Lord so now he begins to
[45:22] cleanse
[45:23] you the process of sanctification
[45:27] and the prophet tells us that the blood
[45:29] of Jesus sanctifies us that God has
[45:34] given the blood praise the Lord for our
[45:38] sanctification so now during that
[45:41] process we simply have to accept the
[45:45] blood praise the Lord to take a hold of
[45:48] us to wash us cleanse us transform us
[45:54] until we are ready for service
[45:58] praise the name Living God and now when
[46:00] you ready for
[46:01] service now he gives us the
[46:04] reward of the Holy Spirit praise the
[46:07] Lord now God worked upon
[46:10] Moses to make sure that
[46:13] Moses was ready for
[46:16] service praise the Lord the service that
[46:19] he was going to do was not an easy
[46:22] service praise the Lord because God
[46:25] knows that Satan never
[46:29] sits when he calls you remember before
[46:32] he called you you are you are there in
[46:35] the world and you are comfortable there
[46:39] so Satan is sure that you are his until
[46:43] God draws you to
[46:45] himself that's when the battle
[46:49] begins praise the living go what tells
[46:53] us B does not belong to us
[46:57] The Battle Belongs to God praise the
[47:01] Living God so what do we have to do we
[47:05] surrender what we have to do surrender
[47:08] when the battles ra we raise up our
[47:12] hands surrender to
[47:14] him praise the Lord Moses he accepted
[47:19] the
[47:19] challenge he accepted the
[47:22] sacrifice he accepted to take up the
[47:25] position
[47:27] to go and lead the
[47:29] people praise the Lord so God worked
[47:32] upon him until he was a finished
[47:36] work praise the Lord so now when the
[47:38] devil tried to come
[47:40] around through his own people to him
[47:46] praise the Lord Moses was in the hand of
[47:51] God
[47:53] vessel God was using
[47:57] his
[47:58] purpose in his time praise the Lord and
[48:02] we are the
[48:03] vessel that God has brought out separ
[48:08] and put
[48:10] aside for
[48:12] service praise the Lord so service that
[48:15] we do we are not doing it unto men but
[48:20] we are doing it unto God praise the Lord
[48:24] that's what says stud
[48:27] Show
[48:29] Yourself
[48:31] approved praise the Lord study the word
[48:35] Show Yourself
[48:37] approved manifest your
[48:40] testimony the testimony of Jesus
[48:43] Christ because this is not your
[48:46] testimony the testimony of Jesus
[48:49] Christ so every little thing that we
[48:53] do let's show ourself approved
[48:58] of that
[48:59] testimony praise the living Moses
[49:04] his
[49:06] approved praise the lord of the
[49:09] testimony because when God met him
[49:12] burning
[49:14] bush spoke to him and he heard from God
[49:19] he was
[49:20] convinced that the thing that he was
[49:22] going to
[49:23] do was not his own but it was the work
[49:28] of God so regardless of the challenge
[49:31] and the battles he would first on the
[49:35] way the
[49:37] assurance that that work did not belong
[49:40] to
[49:41] him the work that we
[49:44] do does not belong to us it belongs to
[49:48] God praise the Lord it is about
[49:52] preaching it is not your ability it's
[49:56] not my ability
[49:57] speak the words the Lord it is the of
[50:02] God God
[50:05] choses gives us the message to take out
[50:08] with the
[50:09] people praise the Lord and when you're
[50:12] doing it you do it
[50:15] Faithfully knowing that what you're
[50:17] doing is not the work of man is the work
[50:20] of
[50:21] God doing the work of God is Not Just
[50:25] preaching
[50:26] every one of us God has called
[50:30] us service praise the Lord each one of
[50:34] us God has called us to do something for
[50:39] him praise the Lord it may be a
[50:42] something too
[50:44] small not even in the church but
[50:47] carrying the
[50:48] testimony to the rest of the
[50:51] world the lord the Bible says in the
[50:54] last days shall be a people that shall
[50:59] carry the message shall car the words
[51:03] not even not in words but their lives
[51:07] shall be a living
[51:09] episode prise the Lord is doing service
[51:13] to the
[51:14] Lord God is doing service the
[51:17] Lord go out to the world our
[51:22] neighborhoods places of work wherever we
[51:25] live Our Testimony is doing service unto
[51:29] the
[51:30] Lord because somehow someone shall read
[51:34] the
[51:34] letter they shall see Christ manifested
[51:38] in your life prise the Lord and they
[51:41] shall come to
[51:42] believe because of the life that you
[51:45] live that is doing service the
[51:49] Lord is staying
[51:51] true faithful to the word of
[51:55] God each
[51:58] everything that we do let's do it
[52:01] Faithfully knowing that we are doing it
[52:03] not unto
[52:05] ourselves butto God God
[52:10] takes such a
[52:12] manise the Lord why he is carrying the
[52:16] testimony of
[52:17] God he has gotten the
[52:19] token he is
[52:21] sealed praise the Lord and even when
[52:24] Satan comes around
[52:26] the man has the
[52:28] Assurance of the
[52:30] token praise the Lord so now that token
[52:34] the
[52:35] seal locks up locks
[52:38] us into the thoughts of
[52:41] God is the word of God
[52:45] expressed while in
[52:47] there nothing can separate
[52:50] us from the love of God which shines
[52:54] upon them that love him
[52:58] so what
[52:59] is nothing is whatever we've been
[53:03] exposed
[53:04] to God gives us the grace praise the
[53:08] Lord God gives us the grace why because
[53:12] God keeps his
[53:14] words if we are carrying his
[53:17] words is faithful to keep his
[53:19] words that's why he was
[53:22] faithful to keep his words job carried
[53:25] it he was faithful to keep his word
[53:29] Daniel
[53:30] carried praise the Lord he cannot leave
[53:33] his
[53:34] word be
[53:36] destroyed why Heaven and Earth shall
[53:40] pass away but his word never pass away
[53:44] and as long as we are carrying the word
[53:46] of
[53:47] God we are carrying the
[53:50] Eternal so Heaven and Earth shall pass
[53:53] away as long as the word of God stays in
[53:56] our
[53:58] life our
[54:00] hearts our
[54:02] soul we shall never
[54:06] perish we shall have eternal
[54:09] life because we have he that is
[54:13] eternal we have that
[54:15] seal praise the Living God now when you
[54:19] locked in there you have the mind of God
[54:23] you express the mind of God
[54:27] the testimony of
[54:29] God you bear the character of
[54:32] God you are patient with
[54:35] God when you are facing a
[54:39] trial you know that God is faithful and
[54:43] we cannot leave a
[54:44] trial that is beyond that which we can
[54:48] overcome to come our way so when you
[54:52] pray and you take it to him you become
[54:56] patient
[54:58] praise the Lord you have the character
[55:00] of
[55:01] God you have the life of
[55:04] God praise the living
[55:08] nothing can separate you from the word
[55:12] of
[55:13] God why you got the
[55:17] seal and you're locked in nothing can
[55:20] get you out of his holy
[55:23] presence praise than living God Moses
[55:27] kept himself
[55:28] there and while the people were
[55:30] stuggling
[55:31] praise the Lord he kept
[55:34] believing why because he was carrying
[55:38] the
[55:39] message the light of his
[55:42] death and he was the witness to the
[55:45] light because he heard the voice of
[55:49] God when he spoke out of the
[55:52] burning we have heard the voice of God
[55:56] through the spoken
[55:58] words we have heard this
[56:00] testimony so we are
[56:02] sure the message that we have
[56:05] believed praise the Living God when
[56:09] Calamity hit
[56:10] them when Calamity H
[56:13] themes said in the book of Deuteronomy
[56:18] 31:6 says Don't
[56:21] Worry Be Strong out of a good courage
[56:26] fear not nor be afraid of for the Lord

[56:58] us will not fail
[57:01] us forsake us
[57:04] failure yes we may
[57:06] fail he does not forsake us in our
[57:11] conditions he can't fail his bright so
[57:15] you raise up and run back to him and
[57:19] present yourself before him he takes
[57:23] care of the
[57:24] rest praise the Lord sickness yes it
[57:27] shall strike us but none of these
[57:31] things can take away the

[57:36] sealed praise the Lord Faithful is
[57:41] he called us he is very faithful and he
[57:45] shall lead us through the
[57:47] Journey so what should we have to do
[57:51] obedient to the word Jeremiah 39:1 17
[58:00] 397 but I will deliver
[58:03] thee in that day says the Lord and thou
[58:06] shall not be given unto the hand of
[58:10] men of whom thou at

[58:46] had the message of
[58:48] his he had the Assurance message and not
[58:52] even death could separate him
[58:56] the word which he had received so when
[58:59] they met him he was speaking with the
[59:03] lot of
[59:05] strength praise the Lord they attempted
[59:07] to kill him he was not afraid of death
[59:11] until they dragged him out of the
[59:14] city sted him he never denounced the
[59:19] words nothing shall separate us from the
[59:22] word of God nothing shall separate us
[59:26] from the
[59:27] love God has toward Us Praise the Lord
[59:32] and the prophet says here in the message
[59:35] the present stage of my
[59:39] ministry2 now here is the
[59:42] thing I want kind of exercise on a few
[59:47] moments
[59:49] usually it is usually at such a time as
[59:53] this when men has stayed true to the
[59:57] word and all men have forsaken him until
[1:00:00] God step
[1:00:03] Sin in defense of that

[1:08:24] Proclamation whoever shall not B to the
[1:08:30] image will be thrown into the
[1:08:33] fiery and they turned their
[1:08:36] back to the
[1:08:38] image regardless of how unpopular they
[1:08:42] became regardless of how excommunicated
[1:08:45] they would
[1:08:46] be from the
[1:08:48] society stayed true to the
[1:08:51] word that's right keeping true to the
[1:08:55] word
[1:08:57] the promises of
[1:08:59] God Daniel took a stand for the word
[1:09:02] what happened to
[1:09:03] him when he was the right hand man to
[1:09:06] the
[1:09:10] king he took a true stand for the
[1:09:13] word and was excommunicated and thrown
[1:09:16] into the
[1:09:18] LI a man of God standing true to the
[1:09:24] words praise the Living God and now let
[1:09:27] me read this
[1:09:29] here he says
[1:09:31] Jesus true to the father's
[1:09:34] word praise the lord we find that Jesus
[1:09:39] was
[1:09:39] true to the father's words he never gave
[1:09:43] up he says I do only that which the
[1:09:47] father
[1:09:50] says because it is written The man shall
[1:09:53] not live by bread alone
[1:09:56] that's when Satan
[1:09:57] came to attack him but he stood true to
[1:10:02] the
[1:10:03] word he never gave up praise the
[1:10:10] Lord that
[1:10:12] word praise the name of the Living God
[1:10:15] and now what do we have to do friends in
[1:10:17] the last days we have the word we have
[1:10:22] received the message let us stand turn
[1:10:25] true to the word which we have
[1:10:28] received when the Devil comes like he
[1:10:32] did in them days of
[1:10:33] job Daniel M and the rest of them he hit
[1:10:39] them down and he thought that he had
[1:10:42] overcome he thought he was
[1:10:45] Victorious but he that lived in those
[1:10:49] men was
[1:10:51] stronger than the devil that was beating
[1:10:54] them down
[1:10:56] and when the time was
[1:10:58] come he rose up and he stood for his
[1:11:03] testimony why because they never
[1:11:06] denounce the word of
[1:11:08] God they remain true to the
[1:11:12] teson praise the name of the Living God
[1:11:15] and he says so they so quickly
[1:11:18] forget what God did was talking about
[1:11:21] the children of Israel how Moses said
[1:11:24] that the Red Sea
[1:11:26] when he stood there and
[1:11:28] said God has done 10 outstanding
[1:11:33] Miracles are you still so deliquent that
[1:11:36] you don't
[1:11:38] know that he is still
[1:11:41] God when challenges come praise the Lord
[1:11:45] challenges came before the of isra and
[1:11:48] they forgot the Miracles they forgot the
[1:11:53] hand of God which he had done we have to
[1:11:57] be faithful and remember that he that
[1:12:01] call us
[1:12:02] out that he that has led us to his word
[1:12:07] is still faithful to his
[1:12:10] word praise the Lord regardless of the
[1:12:14] fighting and everything around
[1:12:16] us God is still faithful to his
[1:12:21] words praise the Lord so when we falter
[1:12:25] when we fall
[1:12:26] sick when we fail remember God is
[1:12:31] faithful to his
[1:12:32] words he that started a good work in
[1:12:36] US is faithful and ready to take it to
[1:12:40] ACC
[1:12:42] comption he's not giving up on
[1:12:45] us until we accomplished
[1:12:48] vessel he's not giving up on us until he
[1:12:52] sees
[1:12:53] us up yonder
[1:12:55] he's not giving up on you until you've
[1:12:59] overcome the
[1:13:00] world and you've won your white
[1:13:03] drop until you overcome the world and
[1:13:07] you're ruling together with him God is
[1:13:10] faithful to his
[1:13:12] word we don't have to give up we don't
[1:13:15] have to be
[1:13:17] dismayed but when we first
[1:13:20] Calamity need to switch into the moment
[1:13:23] of worship
[1:13:25] because worship worshiping and praising
[1:13:29] God what did he say praise the Lord they
[1:13:33] said but job the same God that your
[1:13:37] profess to be faithful too he has
[1:13:40] allowed Satan to kill your children to
[1:13:44] kill your flock he's even taking away
[1:13:46] your
[1:13:47] body praise the Lord but what did job
[1:13:51] say he says it is God that give
[1:13:55] and it is God that takes away blessed be
[1:13:59] the name of the Lord job remained
[1:14:03] faithful and what did he do God was
[1:14:07] faithful to him praise the Lord and God
[1:14:10] came to him and he said job here I am
[1:14:15] and began questioning him then he said
[1:14:19] because of your
[1:14:21] faithfulness look up here and when job
[1:14:24] looked up there
[1:14:25] he saw another job praise the Lord he
[1:14:29] saw another job in glorified body in a
[1:14:33] body that is
[1:14:35] renewed and the body did not have any
[1:14:38] worms he saw himself up there and what
[1:14:41] did he say the Bible says
[1:14:44] job
[1:14:46] shouted and say I
[1:14:48] know my redeemer
[1:14:51] leaveth St true to the word be faithful
[1:14:56] he gives us a reward and when he comes
[1:14:59] on the scene he will be able to sing a
[1:15:02] song that you know your Redeemer
[1:15:06] liveth praise the Lord I was watching a
[1:15:10] preacher preach and there was a clip
[1:15:13] that I was
[1:15:14] watching and there was a
[1:15:16] gentleman who was preaching and while he
[1:15:19] was preaching people came and mocked him
[1:15:23] and they took away the microphone that
[1:15:25] was using to preach praise the Lord and
[1:15:28] now he be began shivering and he was
[1:15:32] ight and they asked him to denounce the
[1:15:36] god which he was preaching and while he
[1:15:39] was still there in a moment of confusion
[1:15:44] there was another preacher that came and
[1:15:47] the preacher stood and he questioned
[1:15:49] them and says why do you mock
[1:15:55] that created the heavens and earth and
[1:15:58] they told him show us proof that your
[1:16:02] God
[1:16:03] exists and says I am the living proof
[1:16:07] that the God that I worship exists you
[1:16:11] don't have any other proof to show the
[1:16:12] world but your life alone is a living
[1:16:17] proof that the god that you worship
[1:16:20] exist praise the Lord and now we had a
[1:16:23] challenge recently
[1:16:25] my wife at the
[1:16:27] workplace she has never had any sort of
[1:16:31] warning any sort of
[1:16:35] warning
[1:16:38] caution from from her bosses and now
[1:16:41] they brought a new regional
[1:16:44] manager and the regional manager made
[1:16:46] sure he changes people in all the
[1:16:48] branches around
[1:16:51] e so he made sure that every manager in
[1:16:55] every
[1:16:57] branch is either chest or is forced to
[1:17:01] reside so now there there was a case at
[1:17:05] her
[1:17:07] branch and she was at leave so now they
[1:17:11] called her to ask her about it she was
[1:17:15] green we were at home and now I told her
[1:17:19] you tell them you away because you don't
[1:17:21] know anything taking place so they
[1:17:23] waited for her to come
[1:17:26] so that regional
[1:17:27] manager had her his people that he
[1:17:31] wanted to put in every
[1:17:33] Branch so now he came with a
[1:17:37] spir he came with a spirior with with
[1:17:40] the
[1:17:41] MD man director from the head office to
[1:17:46] the branch then he began causing many
[1:17:51] accusations upon my wife so because she
[1:17:54] was was kind of
[1:17:56] terrified she could not defend
[1:17:59] herself then the following day she could
[1:18:02] not come to church because she found a
[1:18:05] lot of work on her
[1:18:07] desk so she went and opened on Sunday so
[1:18:12] she missed that day the day we had the
[1:18:14] Lord supper so now she was there working
[1:18:17] and doing some works and now at around 5
[1:18:22] she's coming home then the regional
[1:18:24] manager
[1:18:25] heard that that the people were working
[1:18:27] on
[1:18:28] Sunday it is normal they keep working
[1:18:30] each time there is a lot of
[1:18:33] work but now he took so he took a
[1:18:36] screenshot of the

[1:18:43] chose her of so many
[1:18:45] things and wrote a letter and called it
[1:18:49] the last
