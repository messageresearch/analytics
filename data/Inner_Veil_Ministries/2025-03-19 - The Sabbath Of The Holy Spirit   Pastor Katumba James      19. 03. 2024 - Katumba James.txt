and help us to have stable Hearts Stable Minds to know that you are taking charge over everything that that goes in our lives Commit This service into your hands may you speak to our hearts Lord may meet all the needs of your children Lord and bless us all together in the name of the Lord Jesus us amen amen so we go to Hebrews chapter 4 we're reading from verse 4 to verse 11 we want to talk about the Sabbath of the Holy Spirit the Sabbath or the Sabbath is the holy spirit praise the name of our Lord so the scripture says for he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise Hebrews 4:4 and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remain that some must enter therein and they to whom it was preached entered not in because of unbelief and again he limit a certain day saying inid today that after so long a time as it is say today if if you hear his voice Harden not your heart for if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day rest to the people of God for that is entered into the rest he also has ceed from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that TR lest any man fall after this example of unbelief you may be seated we want to talk about the Sabbath of the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord so here he's talking about God giving them a Sabbath in the Old Testament but the sabath in the Old Testament was the seventh day but then they would enter the seventh day and then come out of the sth day but then saying that if that was the rest he had talked about he would not have talked of another day but then this day talking about is a Sabbath that is eternal a Sabbath that you enter by faith because they were already observing The Saturdays they never entered into his rest because of unbelief praise the name of our Lord now in the message Hebrews chapter [Music] 5 he says the Sabbath is the rest that we enter into not by day not by law but entering into Christ which is our Sabbath he is our Sabbath we run it all through the Old Testament about the seventh day and God did rest the seventh day give it to the children of Israel in the wilderness and again he limited a day what was it a certain day in the week the day when you hear his voice don't Harden your heart that's the day he's entering in to give you an eternal pece an eternal Sabbath praise the name of Lord says you don't go to church on Sunday to become religious then when you are born of the spirit of God you enter into to the rest forever no morebath keeping you are in the Sabbath continually Forever and For Eternity your worldly Works has finished says the Bible and you've entered into the blessed praise the name of so now Sabbath is rest but then the rest begins in with the rest the the rest is instituted when God rested on the seventh [Music] day when we read in Genesis chapter 2 and then we see where God starts talking about rest in verse one Genesis 2 thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God all his work which he had made praise the name of the Lord so God took six days creating the heavens and the Earth rather and then now on the seventh day the Bible says he rested now when God rested on the seventh day he didn't go back and start creating again so you see that the seventh day which was given to the children of Israel was just a shadow of the reality of God is rest praise the name of our Lord because they would enter into this sabbath day and then they would go out of it but then the rest of God was eternal when he stopped creation he had seed from all his works so now for us to get the true Sabbath praise the name of our Lord an eternal rest it's not entering into a day and then you come out of the day so now the Bible says in verse three and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work the Bible says he had rested from all his work so he didn't go back on the first day again start creating like the the Sabbath day keepers the keepers of theb day you know they on Friday then on Saturday they get into and you know when you look at the principle of the Sabbath keep keeping in the Old Testament they were not even allowed to pick any firewood there are people they found picking firewood there people they found picking firewood they killed them so we can ask the peepers of the seventh day don't they also pick firewood praise the name of our Lord so you see that that was just a shadow and even when the Lord Jesus Christ came he would he on the Sabbath the disciples go in the garden on the Sabbath Jesus would tell them that the son of man is the Lord of Sabbath praise the name of our Lord so the day of Sabbath which was the seventh day in the Old Testament just a shadow showing the rest that would get in God by receiving the baptism of the holy spirit so now when we receive the Holy Spirit then you have received the Sabbath of God actually that's what the scripture says when we go to 11se 2 praise the name of our Lord MTH 11:28 so the scripture says come unto me all ye that labor and are Heaven Len and I will give you rest so we see that Christ is inviting us that we can come to him that we receive that rest then he says take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am me and LLY in heart and you shall find rest for your souls so then you go to Christ you take your B to Christ and then he said bring your yoke learn of me because I am me and L in heart and then you shall find rest for your soul so now the rest is talking about is the Sabbath it's not the keeping of day but it is you to come to Christ with yourens you come to Christ with all the trou that you have and then you bring every trouble you bring it to Christ and now when you bring your burdens to Christ then Christ gives you his own rest praise the name of our Lord that is the true Sabbath Sabbath is not the keeping of the day Sabbath is the Life of Christ in you that we receive by receiving his holy spirit praise the name of the Lord that's the Sabbath is talking about here and then it says in verse 30 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light praise the name of Lord so that's the we are all invited that we can come and get the rest from God we can get the rest that Jesus Christ gives praise the name of our Lord now in the Vision let us see what the Bible teaches us about the Sabbath for he that is entered into his rest praise the name of the Lord is quoting the scriptures which we read in HEB Hebrews chapter 4 praise the name of our Lord that if we enter his rest that is the rest of God we also sees from our own works let us go back and put an emphas on Hebrews chapter 4 first Hebrews 4:9 and vers 10 he says for there remain therefore a rest to the people of God Hebrews 4:9 is entered into his rest rest God's Own rest it says when we enter into the rest of God we also seize we stop our own works we stop our own living but now it is Christ that liveth in Us Praise the name of our Lord taken over us we have entered into his rest we are New Creations so it is the rest of God that we receive when we receive the spirit of God let us go back to Theos Vision he says this entering in is not entering in this entering in is not only entering in but remaining in the rest is an eternal rest of which the seventh day is just but a type seven is completion is the first day again Jesus resurrection was in the first day of the week giving us eternal life and eternal Sabbath rest thus we see why God could not give us any one certain day of the week as a Sabbath or rest we've entered into and do remain in our rest which Israel could not do he said in M 11 verse 28 come unto me all ye that and are heav and I will give you rest take my yoke and learn of me and you shall find rest or the keeping of the Sabbath not a day but eternal life Sabbath your soul no matter how long you've been laboring under your load of sin whether in 10 years years or years or longer come with your tired life and you find his rest the true Sabbath Jesus will give you rest praise the name of our Lord so it is Christ that gives us the Sabbath by filling us with the Holy Spirit then we get the Sabbath of God praise the name of our lord it's not the keeping of the day praise the name of our Lord the keeping of the day was in the Old Testament but in the New Testament it is now in Christ praise the name of the Lord like our friends like the seventh day our friends like keeping the seventh day why don't Slaughter animals because they are still wanting Shadows why didn't they get animals to their churches when the Bible tells us that the law had the shadow of good things to come in Hebrews 10 verse one for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by continually make the comers there are un perfect praise the name of our Lord so he says they would not the Shadows would not make the worshippers perfect and then we see that all the shadows in the Old Testament they were all pointing us to Christ the shadows in the Old Testament they were all pointing us to one perfect sacrifice all the Fists in the whole scriptures they were all pointing us to Christ talking about the life of Jesus Christ the peace offering you know the trespass offerings all the offerings whe they were you know goats or they were lamps bus they were pigeons you know all of them were appointing us to Christ so even all the types and shadows they were all pointing us to Christ praise the name of our Lord so the keeping of the saath day was pointing us to the true rest come praise the name of the Lord when we go to the book of Isaiah chapter 28 Isaiah talks about how this rest is going to be fulfill F Isaiah 2 verse the scripture says for all tables are full of vomit and fness so that there is no place clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge and whom Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are wi from milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people [Music] to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the we to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear praise the name of our Lord so he says this is the rest this is the Sabbath how did it come it came on the day of Pentecost by the baptism of the holy spirit because the prophet was showing them how the Holy Ghost would come down and with stammering lips and another tongue he will speak to these people he said this is the rest now in Theos Vision he says here it is prophesied right here in Isaiah it came to pass about 7 years later at Pentecost when they were all filled with the Holy Ghost exactly as it was said they would be this is the true Sabbath that was promised th when they were filled with the Holy Ghost They Se from their worldly Works they worldly doings they evil ways the Holy Ghost took charge over their lives they entered into the rest there is your rest that is your Sabbath it's not a day not but the eternity of being filled and blessed in the Holy Spirit it is you seing and God doing it is God in you doing his good pleasure praise the name of our Lord so the Sabbath true Sabbath is the baptism of the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord you see when you look when you for example the holy spirit means everything to us praise the name of the Lord because the Holy Ghost has different kind of you know references we can give to he says speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you come into the land which I give you then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord [Music] six years you shall s your field and six years you shall prone your vineard and gather in the fruit there but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land a Sabbath for the Lord thou sh neither s thy field nor your vineard praise the name of the Lord so you see now again he brings that the land must also have a Sabbath and says the six years you plant you use your land but then in the seventh year you let your land rest to have a Sabbath and now as you continue reading then he told them about having seven sabbaths of the land and that means that seven cycles of seven years and now that makes it 49 years and then he says now the 50th shall be Ailee unto you praise the name of the Lord so when we read in verse 8 and you shall number seven thases of years unto thee seven time seven years and space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40 and9 years and then in verse 10 and you shall H the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land and to all the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family for it is the Jubilee verse 12 it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession praise the name of our Lord so you see how the Lord comes forth and gives the shadows in the Old Testament and now as they working as the Shadows are being kept then he comes and prophesies about the Fulfillment of these Shadows like he gave them the Sabbath day in Isaiah comes and points to us that the true rest is when they are receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit and now he is talking about the land having seven sabbaths and then he declares the of Jubilee theth then Isaiah picks that up and then brings its real meaning and fulfillment and then he gives a prophecy of how the Year of Jubilee is going to be fulfilled in its reality so now in Isaiah 61 and then in verse one the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the BR brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that abound [Music] verse two to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord praise the name of the Lord Isaiah is speaking from the Shadows is turning it around and saying there is a time this is going to be fulfilled God has anointed me with his Spirit to preach Good Tidings he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted and to declare Liberty now he's taking them from the 50th Year of Jubilee declaring them that a time is coming where the gospel is going to declare Liberty to the captives and soever wants to be free will be made free praise the name of our Lord so we see that the Old Testament there were Shadows and within the Old Testament God would send the prophets and then the prophets would come and show us the Fulfillment of these Shadows praise the name of our Lord let us hold that there for the time being we go to Isaiah chapter 53 praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says in Isaiah chter 53 and then we can start reading from verse six okay let us start from verse four surely has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem stricken and smitten of God and afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed all we like ship had gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord laid on him all the iniquity of US own praise the name of the Lord he said he laid on him all our iniquity praise the name of the Lord just again shows us back the atonment day now on the day of atonment in lus 16 the priest the high priest high priest he had to cast lots over a goat one go where he would let the sins of the people and then another go which he had to sacrifice praise the name of the Lord in lus 6 and then verse 9 and and Aaron shall bring the goat upon the Lord's Lot F and offer him for a sin offering the 16:9 and Aaron shall and the Goat on which the Lord fell to the scap goat shall be presented alive before the Lord to make an atonement with him and let him go for escap goat Into the Wilderness [Music] praise the name of the Lord so then Aaron would go and offer the blood on the Mery seat he could sacrifice the bull for his sins and his family and then the other God sacrifices it for the sins of the people sprink on the SE and then the Bible says after he has made you know after he has made reconciliation of the Holy place and the Tabernacle and the altar that's verse 20 now he shall bring the life go then in verse 21 and Alon shall lay both his hands upon the head of the and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions in all their sins putting them upon the head of the go and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness and the God shall bear upon him all the iniquities land inhabited e e e e e e e to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your eyes praise the name of Lord so all these Shadows they were all fulfilled in Christ in the Old Testament they had of Jubilee after every 50 years but it was a shadow depicting the salvation of Christ for them they had it once in 50 years but to us praise the name of our Lord the Gospel of Jesus Christ that any person who is bound can go free any time you don't wait for 50 years now but the moment you hear the gospel of your salvation then you receive your Liberty you receive your Jubilee and the same gospel that declares Jubilee to us is the same gospel where we receive the Sabbath of our rest praise the name of our Lord so everything is fulfilled in Christ no wonder the Bible says that nobody should judge you youi let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a holiday or of the new moon or of the Sabbath days Colossians 2: 16 [Music] he says let no man judge you now what you eat some say we don't eat meat on Friday judge on that or you drinking or in respect of a holid day this day is more than this day say nobody should judge you about or keeping of the new moon or the Sabbath days and then in verse 17 the Bible says which are a shadow of the things to come but the body is of Christ praise the name of the Lord he says there a shadow so they are all fulfilled in Christ praise the name of our Lord and the Bible says there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ praise the name of our Lord when you are in Christ you fulfilled all the law praise the name of the Lord why because Christ is the Fulfillment of the law and the prophets so now when I'm in Christ I fulfill all those kind of things I fulfill the law of Moses I fulfill the prophets because they were a shadow of Christ they were pointing us to Christ now the reality has come why should I live in the shadows the name of our Lord Christ is the Fulfillment of the law and the prophets so when I'm in Christ I fulfill all the law of Moses so people should not trouble you why don't you go to church on Saturday not judge you and then the issue is why do we come to church on Sunday in the ear churches they were actually assembling on the first day of the week and it's on the first day of the week that our Lord Jesus Christ resurrected praise the name of our Lord this names that M Tuesday Wednesday Saturday Sunday they came later ones Sunday but we had the first day of the week second day Third Day fourth day up to theth day but our Lord Jesus Christ resurrected on the first day of the week so now the disciples did that as a commemoration you know worshiping on the first day of the week because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ so it's not a day that was started by a certain praise the name of the Lord in verse 7 the bible says and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached unto them ready to depart on the tomorrow and conted his speech until midnight so they were gathering on the first day of the week and now the people are gathering on the first day of the week in the old in the in the Bible times during times of the Apostles in the book of Acts they recognize the resurrection of Jesus Christ but now those who are still living in the law for those who are still living the law they were now on the Sabbath day so somebody distinct know this one is still in his Sabbath that this one doesn't believe the Lord Jesus Christ but then those who believed the Lord Jesus Christ they were gaed on the of the week in First Corinthians verse the scripture says upon the first day of the week let let every one of you led by him in store as God has prospered him that there be no Gatherings when I come why is he talking about the first day of the week people were gathering together so he was tell them you can lay in store the things you want to give out praise the name of the Lord so nobody should judge us by the day we worship it is a shadow and then also on the first day of the week because the scripture says when the day of Pentecost had fully come and the day of Pentecost let us go to Leviticus chapter 24 praise the name of our Lord Leviticus chapter 24 and we pick Pentecost from there okay excuse me lus chapter 23 and then verse 15 and he says and you shall count unto you from the Tom after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the thief of w offering seven sabbaths shall be complete even the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall you number 50 days and you shall offer a meat offering unto the Lord now in in verse in verse 21 and you shall Proclaim on the self same day that it may be a holy convocation unto you and you shall do no sural work therein it shall be a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout the day of Pentecost they had the Feast of Pentecost and then in the New Testament in 2 verse1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance that's praise the name of the Lord so we see that the Holy Spirit fell on the day of Pentecost which was the first day of the week it was the day the Church of Jesus Christ was born that's why we keep sus to worship on the day like that the day our Lord Jesus Christ resurrected and the the church was born the first day of the week praise the name of the Lord so don't allow somebody to confuse you you don't keep the Sabbath tell them I have the Sabbath praise the name of the Lord I don't enter in and come out but I have the Sabbath and that's the rest the Lord Jesus Christ gives to us by the baptism of the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord so we see all these are fulfilled in our Lord Jesus Christ so when we have Christ in us we fulfill all the law when we have Christ in us we fulfill all the law praise the name of the Lord when we have Christ in US we fulfill all the law we fulfill all the prophet praise the name of our Lord and how can Christ be in you how can Christ be in You by filling you with his own Spirit by giving you his own life praise the name of the Lord so you have the power of God you have the power of God you have the Sabbath of God and you have whatever the holy spirit is is right inside of Us Praise the name of our Lord that's why we should always desire to have the spirit of God living in us that's how we fulfill all the law and the prophets praise the name of our Lord bless you amen for those of you maybe are not on WhatsApp or maybe receive a message like from me on Sunday we have a special service so you have only one service
