[37:29] foreign
[37:33] [Music]
[37:59] so before we start this service
[38:05] you know we've got a few things to take
[38:09] out of the way
[38:12] if Sister
[38:14] Shalom can walk to the front this is
[38:19] she desires to be prideful
[38:26] is a Hebrew blessing
[38:30] a Hebrew blessing
[38:34] that's the laying on of hands
[38:37] but the Gentile blessings
[38:40] just speak the word
[38:43] so I think she wants to take both don't
[38:46] say it I go to I love your own being
[38:47] amen our sister
[38:49] had a situation she
[38:54] just has you know not been able to carry
[38:57] a baby for nine months twice
[39:04] so it gets to be a point of concern yeah
[39:10] which I want us to join our hands
[39:13] together in prayer yeah
[39:16] so that we can claim a perfect blessing
[39:19] for our sisters
[39:22] you know children are a gift from the
[39:25] Lord
[39:30] [Music]
[39:44] [Music]
[40:01] [Music]
[40:09] [Music]
[40:20] that whatsoever the enemy
[40:23] has said first Lord
[40:26] we scattered by the power of the name of
[40:30] Jesus
[40:32] I pray that may bring a daughter and
[40:36] perfect healing upon our life
[40:40] and father that you may Grant a special
[40:43] blessings
[40:45] children come from the Lord
[40:48] father we ask one from you
[40:51] for this our sister
[40:54] you've done so many miraculous things
[40:58] [Music]
[41:05] I pray that to me bless ourselves
[41:11] and give her the grace
[41:14] to bring forth a baby
[41:19] and we believe it is because you
[41:22] promised him each time we pray in the
[41:25] name of Jesus
[41:29] [Music]
[41:35] [Music]
[41:45] thank you
[41:47] praise the Lord
[41:49] and then we've got one of us here again
[42:02] she's so smart this morning
[42:06] there must be a Cause
[42:12] she
[42:13] [Music]
[42:33] [Music]
[42:56] [Music]
[43:05] [Music]
[43:08] so this is
[43:15] and
[43:21] [Music]
[43:24] the two era
[43:28] that two
[43:32] come to an agreement uh
[43:37] they've visited the family
[43:40] and they allowed him to proceed
[43:43] [Music]
[43:45] and take agonists
[43:50] amen amen
[43:53] so they want to announce the agreement
[43:57] before you know
[44:02] and I want them to turn that we may pray
[44:05] with them
[44:05] [Music]
[44:17] precious heavenly father is
[44:19] Lord I bring Jenna and darkness before
[44:26] that they've come to an agreement
[44:29] which agreement father we blessed
[44:33] as we pray for them Lord
[44:37] proceeding to their wedding day
[44:41] we pray that you may give them more
[44:43] grace
[44:47] [Music]
[44:52] the glory of the father in Jesus name
[44:59] thank you
[45:05] yes sir so we proceed
[45:09] teaching of the word now
[45:13] if you can stand up and we're getting
[45:16] the scripture reading
[45:22] we shall turn to the Book of Genesis
[45:27] chapter 12.
[45:37] yeah we shall turn to Genesis chapter
[45:39] 12.
[45:42] verses one two three
[45:46] now the Lord had said unto Abraham
[45:51] get thee out of thy country
[45:54] and from thy kindred
[45:56] and from thy father's house
[45:59] [Music]
[46:07] and I will bless thee
[46:10] and make thy name great
[46:13] and thou shalt be a blessing
[46:18] Abram was blessed
[46:21] to bless
[46:25] there's no reason why God would bless
[46:28] you
[46:30] if you cannot use your blessing to the
[46:33] benefit of the body
[46:38] amen amen and I bless them that blessed
[46:42] day
[46:48] and in this shallow the families of the
[46:50] earth be blessed
[46:55] word of prayer
[46:57] Heavenly Father
[46:59] we have read the scriptures
[47:04] Lord I pray as we approach the teaching
[47:11] that you may pick the real mind of God
[47:16] behind those scriptures
[47:19] to be the food for your children this
[47:21] morning
[47:23] I pray that the spirit of Grace
[47:27] that spoke to my heart
[47:30] Could Be The Same Spirit of Grace
[47:33] to receive from the hearts of the
[47:36] hearers
[47:40] bless our
[47:42] assembly Lord
[47:45] whatsoever need do we have of uh
[47:48] I pray that you may visit in the
[47:51] teaching of the world
[47:54] and when these people leave this place
[47:57] I pray that they'll be able to testify
[48:00] of the blessings of God
[48:04] I have committed this service into your
[48:06] hands
[48:08] in Jesus name
[48:10] amen amen you may be seated
[48:14] now
[48:16] we thank God for this day
[48:20] amen amen I know the weather has upset
[48:24] many people
[48:27] but I'm looking forward for a great
[48:30] blessing
[48:33] as we get into the service today
[48:37] amen I am a firm believer
[48:41] in the written word
[48:43] um foreign
[48:49] [Music]
[48:59] which becomes dangerous to you
[49:03] the word must go to the soul
[49:08] to be processed
[49:10] and then Steward as Revelation
[49:15] to seal you as a Believer
[49:19] because the processed word
[49:23] amen becomes perfect size
[49:27] the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:30] himself
[49:34] and then the streams of Grace
[49:42] into your mental faith that if God
[49:48] [Music]
[49:50] then upon this spiritual Revelation
[49:54] is where Jesus says
[49:57] I'll build my church
[50:00] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[50:03] against it
[50:06] amen amen that's what God wants to do
[50:10] to run the word from your mind
[50:15] to this song
[50:17] it's only when it's in the soul
[50:21] but it becomes perfect faith
[50:26] and it becomes Revelation
[50:29] once it hits that spot
[50:33] then you are a church
[50:35] that's built upon the rock
[50:38] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[50:42] against it
[50:44] amen so my title this morning
[50:48] is Abraham the blessing
[50:52] amen amen many times we talk about the
[50:55] blessings of Abraham
[50:58] but many times
[51:01] we forget remember
[51:04] that he was not only blessed
[51:08] but he was also a blessing
[51:12] what do you want to be a blessing to
[51:14] this church
[51:46] a blessing to all the families
[51:51] and to be blessed
[51:54] is not only having material things
[51:59] you look at a man with a nice home
[52:03] with a nice kind and then he said the
[52:07] man is blessed
[52:10] that's just a little bit of what
[52:13] blessing is
[52:15] to be blessed is to find God's favor in
[52:21] multiple ways
[52:24] amen that God's favor is with you
[52:28] in your family among your children in
[52:33] your
[52:34] business you find the hand of God with
[52:37] you
[52:39] and you see his father
[52:56] [Music]
[52:59] that could replenish
[53:05] and finally have dominion
[53:13] [Music]
[53:35] [Music]
[53:44] it belongs to you this morning
[53:47] amen you need to know you are not only
[53:50] blessed
[53:52] but you are a blessing amen so the
[53:56] greatest blessing of Abraham
[53:59] was in Genesis
[54:01] and Christo testifies of that blessing
[54:06] he says your
[55:06] shall be no more welcome to
[55:10] and when that happens
[55:13] that's the day of the Lord
[55:15] isn't that amen
[55:18] yes sir now Abraham as the prophet says
[55:23] he was transmitted
[55:26] Amen to see the day of the Lord he was
[55:31] out here in the valley of Chevy
[55:36] amen
[55:39] which is the King's Nails
[55:43] in the spirit so it was transported
[55:48] into the day of the Lord
[55:51] amen he is so King yeah
[55:56] Hallelujah that raises after the day of
[56:00] men
[56:03] praise the Lord
[56:06] after the slot of the Kings foreign
[56:24] [Music]
[56:46] [Music]
[56:55] [Music]
[57:09] foreign
[57:31] [Applause]
[57:37] who comes after all these human
[57:41] civilization is done
[57:45] and when Jesus was speaking to the
[57:48] Pharisees
[57:50] he says Abraham
[57:53] saw my day
[57:55] he saw the king of righteousness
[57:58] praise the Lord so the testimony
[58:11] [Applause]
[58:33] meaning that we really need to see the
[58:36] hand of God
[58:38] foreign
[58:43] are you together with me we need to see
[58:47] the hand of God
[58:51] now let's go to Genesis chapter 35.
[58:55] [Music]
[58:58] we are talking about blessings
[59:02] let's see how God blessed Jacobs
[59:09] amen
[59:11] says and God appeared unto Jacob again
[59:17] when he came out of padanaram and
[59:21] blessed him
[59:24] God appeared
[59:27] God blessed
[59:32] he blessed Abraham he appears to jack up
[59:37] He blesses
[59:39] he appears to you He blesses
[59:43] thank you
[59:45] are you together with me so meaning that
[59:48] your new birth in itself
[59:52] is the great place
[59:54] because you're new balance is God
[59:58] appearing to you
[59:59] by
[1:00:05] revelationally receiving the Lord Jesus
[1:00:09] Christ
[1:00:10] and the moment you step into his
[1:00:13] presence you have stepped into blessing
[1:00:18] foreign
[1:00:35] amen Amina now look at Western here and
[1:00:40] God said that to Jacob
[1:00:43] thy name is Jacob
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:47] thy name shall not be called anymore
[1:00:51] Jacob
[1:00:55] but Israel shall be thy name
[1:01:00] and he called his name
[1:01:03] [Music]
[1:01:05] Israeli you see every blessing
[1:01:09] comes with a pronouncement
[1:01:13] and this time here the blessing was the
[1:01:18] changing of the character
[1:01:22] are you together with me because we know
[1:01:26] the name
[1:01:28] speaks of characters
[1:01:32] foreign
[1:01:43] are you together with me the blessing
[1:01:46] here
[1:01:47] was the change
[1:01:52] he says I know your name is Jacob
[1:01:55] but shall never be Jacob
[1:01:58] you are going to be Israel
[1:02:02] amen so now this is the way you should
[1:02:06] understand
[1:02:08] thy character
[1:02:10] who wants to be a supplanter
[1:02:13] because that's what Jacob means
[1:02:18] shall not anymore be that of the supply
[1:02:24] but rather a character that is the
[1:02:28] praise with God
[1:03:01] it's not like out there in organizations
[1:03:06] where the blessing they are talking
[1:03:08] about
[1:03:09] is money for everybody
[1:03:12] but the Bible says and God blessed
[1:03:16] Abraham
[1:03:18] which means that blessing was not only
[1:03:23] the material feet that Abraham possesses
[1:03:29] is my example here that's the blessing
[1:03:33] God is giving to Jacob
[1:03:35] is to change his character
[1:03:39] because in the Bible the name speaks
[1:03:43] about the inbued characters
[1:03:48] and we see that we never change came to
[1:03:52] the characters
[1:03:54] we also see the change of name
[1:03:58] from Abraham to Abraham
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:02] are you together with me amen from Sarah
[1:04:06] to Sarah
[1:04:09] because the name is
[1:04:18] the name is announcing a new character
[1:04:22] so when God missed Jacob which means
[1:04:27] he says
[1:04:40] this morning
[1:05:07] is now made visible by a manifestation
[1:05:11] of character that Jesus came to manifest
[1:05:16] amen amen that's John 17 6.
[1:05:20] I have manifested thy character
[1:05:27] that's why you would say
[1:05:30] uh I've been with you here
[1:05:33] and you do not know me
[1:05:35] when they said show us the father
[1:05:39] and then he says he that has seen me
[1:05:42] has seen the father because they came in
[1:05:46] my father's name
[1:05:47] so the blessings of God is Not basically
[1:05:52] money
[1:05:53] don't limit God's blessing to you
[1:05:57] in areas of financially
[1:06:00] amen we have seen our sister Shalom here
[1:06:04] in my life she desires a different form
[1:06:08] of blessing
[1:06:09] she's able to handle her life
[1:06:13] she has a good job
[1:06:15] but that's not the blessing she needs
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:19] now is the blessing to have a baby
[1:06:23] are you together and I've always told
[1:06:27] you
[1:06:28] that you see the reason why we are still
[1:06:32] here is
[1:06:33] because not every elect is born
[1:06:38] now that not every elect is Born
[1:06:42] the young ladies who are still loving
[1:06:44] babies
[1:06:46] let them ask for one
[1:06:49] from glory Lord send one by my womb
[1:06:56] amen that's what sister Shalom should do
[1:07:00] to ask for a special blessing to be a
[1:07:04] career of an elected
[1:07:26] thus finding favor with God
[1:07:29] amen that we may be able to touch
[1:07:33] those heavenly blessings in Christ Jesus
[1:07:38] so that was blessings could flow your
[1:07:42] way
[1:07:43] the man the men who are mouth
[1:07:45] millionaires
[1:07:48] they cannot go into that area
[1:07:51] That's The Preserve of the election
[1:07:55] Hallelujah is the only one who can
[1:07:59] access
[1:08:00] those Divine blessings in Heavenly
[1:08:04] places
[1:08:05] amen that is a blessed man
[1:08:08] he lives
[1:08:11] Amen to benefit others
[1:08:16] a blessed man is a chain of blessings
[1:08:23] foreign
[1:08:50] [Music]
[1:09:06] are you together with me what is it amen
[1:09:09] amen so let's look at the blessings of
[1:09:12] Abraham
[1:09:14] Galatians
[1:09:16] and verse 14.
[1:09:19] that's the blessing of vibration
[1:09:23] might come on the Gentiles
[1:09:26] through Jesus Christ that we might
[1:09:30] receive away the promise of the
[1:09:33] spiritual through faith
[1:09:49] through Jesus
[1:09:53] amen amen so the same blessing
[1:09:56] that Abraham Isaac and Jacob and joy

[1:10:09] Gentiles

[1:20:47] assembling of ourselves together
[1:20:50] because each one of us

[1:20:57] and once we come together
[1:20:59] you are tapping into the blessings
[1:21:02] amen amen praise the Lord

[1:21:11] room
[1:21:13] Jones attribute towards difference
[1:21:17] attribute to us different
[1:21:20] but yet all that was a portion of the
[1:21:24] spirit of God
[1:21:27] so Joe needed poor I mean John needed
[1:21:30] James
[1:21:32] needed
[1:21:34] as they were
[1:21:48] when they stepped out of the uh foreign
[1:22:47] brother Branham says a lot of people
[1:22:51] like try to make God they see us and
[1:22:54] rebook Harmony House you know these ones
[1:22:58] actually he may not really know what
[1:23:00] Sia's rebok and Harmony House means but
[1:23:04] out there in the states
[1:23:08] these are big kilot companies
[1:23:18] and you find that you know uh see us or
[1:23:24] Republic or Harmony has got a different
[1:23:27] type of Desire of an auntie
[1:23:31] um
[1:23:35] so they bring up forms of desire
[1:23:40] and then you go on one line and you find
[1:23:43] thousands of Suits we
[1:23:47] foreign
[1:24:11] that makes everything uniform
[1:24:15] he says
[1:24:22] are you together with it yeah don't you
[1:24:25] think
[1:24:26] that you can survive on your own alone
[1:24:32] you need me to bless you okay
[1:24:38] just a matter of shaking our hearts
[1:24:42] amen amen for those people who have met
[1:24:45] God
[1:24:47] there is something that flows
[1:24:51] and blesses another brother
[1:24:56] we don't shake hands like a kind of
[1:24:59] people do
[1:25:01] just to shake your hands and have a good
[1:25:04] feeling that's not what it is you are a
[1:25:08] different type of people
[1:25:10] you come from God you carry blessing and
[1:25:15] God gave me a portion and give another
[1:25:18] brother and give the other brother
[1:25:21] look how it is a blessing for Brethren
[1:25:26] to me together in unity it's like the
[1:25:30] oil
[1:25:34] that's what it is
[1:25:40] amen amen see he makes Peter
[1:25:44] and Paul
[1:25:46] Apostles but yet they are totally
[1:25:49] different
[1:25:50] in the delivery of their Ministries
[1:25:55] all of us are part of that great mind of
[1:26:00] Eternity
[1:26:05] is different from the others and our
[1:26:09] difference is the blessing
[1:26:14] foreign
[1:26:50] others that God
[1:26:53] thinks like me
[1:26:57] and if you don't think like me
[1:27:00] you don't have God
[1:27:02] we can't narrow God like that
[1:27:05] for you that's why God deals with the
[1:27:08] body
[1:27:11] you are so narrow
[1:27:14] the what you are
[1:27:18] designed by your culture
[1:27:22] maybe was designed by your education
[1:27:26] maybe it was designed by your
[1:27:29] theological background
[1:27:33] it is so Narrows
[1:27:35] you cannot represent the entire girl
[1:27:40] so God is
[1:27:45] designed this bride
[1:27:48] with an eternal Minds
[1:27:51] and we need to look at things
[1:27:54] based on God's Eternal Minds
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:00] did you hear that
[1:28:03] amen amen we need to think closer based
[1:28:09] on God's Eternal Minds
[1:28:12] because they were in him before the
[1:28:15] foundation of the world
[1:28:17] and we are manifested
[1:28:20] to think like a god
[1:28:24] amen amen when I think like a god
[1:28:29] foreign
[1:29:04] are you together with it praise God are
[1:29:08] you a Believer this morning
[1:29:10] the reason why you are a belief is
[1:29:14] because
[1:29:17] [Music]
[1:29:19] that's the Revelation you have today
[1:29:24] anybody who fails to believe
[1:29:27] it's because he does not have that
[1:29:30] Eternal element of the father
[1:29:34] amen so that's what the word teaches
[1:29:39] John chapter 5
[1:29:41] verse 24.
[1:29:44] verily verily I say unto you
[1:29:48] he that heareth my word
[1:29:51] and believeth on him that sent to me has
[1:29:57] eternal life
[1:30:03] because you have eternal life
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:34] in this truth
[1:30:39] amen Amina I therefore want to use this
[1:30:43] opportunity
[1:30:45] to pick ourselves from
[1:30:49] eternity this morning
[1:30:51] and bring ourselves in time
[1:30:54] to be a blessing
[1:30:59] the more the reason why
[1:31:02] you don't see this blessing
[1:31:05] is because you have never known that you
[1:31:10] came from eternity and you were blessed
[1:31:14] with the spiritual blessings before the
[1:31:18] foundations
[1:31:21] bring you out
[1:31:26] not to prove that you are cast
[1:31:29] but to prove that you are blessed
[1:31:36] and God
[1:31:39] blessed in
[1:31:47] let us pick up ourselves
[1:31:51] in the message the leadership of
[1:31:53] Covenant again
[1:31:57] is the place brother Branham says
[1:32:00] there is one form of eternal life
[1:32:05] and that comes from God
[1:32:08] and before then every creature
[1:32:14] that would ever have it okay
[1:32:18] are you together there is only one form
[1:32:22] of eternal life
[1:32:25] and God prepared Electronics
[1:32:32] I am one of those Christians
[1:32:48] one of his attributes was to begin with
[1:32:51] you
[1:32:54] amen Amina uh
[1:32:57] all you'll never be there
[1:33:00] you come forth in the burning ground of
[1:33:04] your mother
[1:33:06] your father didn't know you what about
[1:33:09] you you were in his Lord
[1:33:11] and when you come first
[1:33:14] in the burning ground of the mother
[1:33:18] then you become a human being
[1:33:23] in the image of your father
[1:33:27] now you can fellowship with him
[1:33:30] and the same thing
[1:33:34] if you got eternal life
[1:33:39] who's giving you a natural example
[1:33:44] your father didn't know you but about
[1:33:46] yakumana
[1:33:47] but because it's a natural one
[1:33:50] but God I can't understand
[1:33:57] but you are connected to him
[1:34:00] by the gene of his lawyers
[1:34:05] and once it drops into the bedding
[1:34:07] ground of your mother
[1:34:09] foreign
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:59] who came from the father are you
[1:35:01] together
[1:35:02] he came prepared
[1:35:05] and blessed
[1:35:07] see I don't want you to get that portion
[1:35:11] that form of thinking
[1:35:15] that there is a special seminar into
[1:35:20] that is going to teach you
[1:35:25] in part blessings
[1:35:28] you are blessed
[1:35:32] you just need to realize it
[1:35:35] and you begin to tap
[1:35:38] into those blessings
[1:35:42] he says
[1:35:44] that little life
[1:35:46] you coming
[1:35:49] the Natural Life
[1:35:51] physical life
[1:35:54] that was by your father
[1:35:57] and the only way you can come born again
[1:36:01] is it has to be from your heavenly
[1:36:05] fathers
[1:36:09] all the father's given me
[1:36:12] will come to me you are here because
[1:36:16] your name
[1:36:17] was placed on the last book of life
[1:36:22] before there was even a foundation of
[1:36:25] the world
[1:36:27] that's exactly right
[1:36:30] you are a genius
[1:36:34] out of your heavenly father a part of
[1:36:38] God's word
[1:36:44] then you was with Jesus
[1:36:47] when he was here we don't even know
[1:36:50] because
[1:36:51] he was the way places
[1:37:12] it blesses myself
[1:37:15] to know that I was in him
[1:37:18] amen amen and that he loved you it
[1:37:22] aren't your name and then he says
[1:37:24] nothing
[1:37:27] shall separate you from the love of God
[1:37:31] that loved you even before the
[1:37:35] foundation
[1:37:38] amen so you were a part
[1:37:41] of the eternal life
[1:37:47] and you are part of the Lamb's Book of
[1:37:50] Life
[1:37:53] your name was written in heaven
[1:37:58] so and the book foreign
[1:38:42] foreign
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:39:26] to behave like Allah
[1:39:32] not to be wild like a world
[1:39:37] that's not the life you have problems
[1:39:46] amen amen but that's part
[1:39:50] you know that part there is blackened to
[1:39:54] you
[1:40:09] that keeps connecting you to Eternity
[1:40:16] amen Amina when I come to preach here
[1:40:20] you think you're knowing something for
[1:40:22] the first time
[1:40:26] you've always known it but just the holy
[1:40:30] spirit
[1:40:31] is removing
[1:40:34] the Mist around it
[1:40:38] to light that portion of the world
[1:40:51] it's because you have eternal life from
[1:40:54] the beginning
[1:40:58] is something that doesn't begin
[1:41:02] but you just realize
[1:41:05] with the time oh thank God
[1:41:11] I didn't begin with the time I was with
[1:41:15] him before the foundation of the world
[1:41:20] amen Amina
[1:41:23] you see that element
[1:41:26] of you in the father
[1:41:29] your mind is blackened with it
[1:41:33] you just can't remember
[1:41:36] just like you can't remember
[1:41:38] when you were sacking as a baby
[1:41:42] you could never remember
[1:41:44] unless they took a video to give that
[1:41:48] Revelation to you
[1:41:53] are you still together with the meeting
[1:41:56] amen amen you were with the father for
[1:42:01] the foundation
[1:42:02] but you were just reluctant to it
[1:42:09] now the message
[1:42:12] comes to clear that mist
[1:42:15] and then you realize
[1:42:20] that's why I've always been in love with
[1:42:23] the world
[1:42:26] that there is always something that was
[1:42:29] calling to me
[1:42:31] that's the seed of eternal life
[1:42:35] that you always had
[1:42:38] amen amen First Peter 1 8.
[1:42:49] you love come on
[1:42:55] can you imagine that you know exactly
[1:42:58] but you have loved for God
[1:43:01] the god whom you've never seen
[1:43:04] and you could even give your life
[1:43:08] it's not because of your mind being
[1:43:11] brainwashed
[1:43:16] because
[1:43:24] that's not what it is it's because there
[1:43:28] is a seed on the inside
[1:43:33] foreign
[1:43:45] who struggled with this message
[1:43:48] they read the books
[1:43:53] they can go and spend a year
[1:43:56] if they have that seed they still come
[1:44:00] back here
[1:44:02] foreign
[1:44:15] come on
[1:44:18] now you see him not without
[1:44:22] yet believing you rejoice
[1:44:25] with joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:44:30] Hallelujah that's why the world thinks
[1:44:34] you're crazy
[1:44:36] because the word is preached
[1:44:39] you are throwing your hands
[1:44:41] you are singing with a lot of joy for
[1:44:45] somebody whom you've never seen
[1:44:48] sometimes you are singing like that with
[1:44:51] a lot of Trials around you but yet that
[1:44:55] thing keeps pulling on you
[1:44:59] sometimes you're rejoicing when you
[1:45:02] didn't have supper last night
[1:45:08] that is
[1:45:10] God has got a hold of you
[1:45:14] quoting things that are to be
[1:45:17] um
[1:45:22] to be a Son of God
[1:45:25] you have to be healed in him always
[1:45:32] spiritual life
[1:45:35] foreign
[1:45:43] [Music]
[1:45:45] [Applause]
[1:45:55] [Applause]
[1:46:08] [Applause]
[1:46:17] he cannot stop it because that which you
[1:46:22] have okay
[1:46:28] Amen
[1:46:30] in Philippine language
[1:46:33] amen like a brother Branham says foreign
[1:47:25] I couldn't overcome in those other ages
[1:47:29] I couldn't have overcome in the time of
[1:47:32] Columbus
[1:47:33] this was my time to overcome
[1:47:37] are you together with me yes sir as each
[1:47:42] member came first
[1:47:43] it became expressed and it took his
[1:47:47] place
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:50] you dropped from eternity
[1:47:54] of Flesh and the moment you get here
[1:48:00] start to take your position in the Bible
[1:48:06] okay you are not a stranger in the body
[1:48:11] you are not lot in Canada
[1:48:14] you are Abraham amen amen and once you
[1:48:18] are Abraham
[1:48:20] I tell you you are not going to have
[1:48:23] struggles for positions
[1:48:25] because your position is foreign
[1:48:47] um
[1:48:49] rest
[1:48:51] under the spirit of adoption
[1:48:54] truly do you want to guide you
[1:48:57] and bring you to your position in the
[1:48:59] body
[1:49:30] foreign you are different I cannot be
[1:49:33] like you when everyone else
[1:49:34] if I try to I'm failing God
[1:49:41] because I'm leaving my position
[1:49:45] amen amen so every one of us comes first
[1:49:50] as an expression of those Eternal
[1:49:54] attributes
[1:49:58] and also you bless
[1:50:11] God was not even God
[1:50:15] he was the great
[1:50:17] Eternal yeah
[1:50:20] and in there was attributes
[1:50:25] attributes was his thoughts
[1:50:31] and then became a word like this
[1:50:36] and the word
[1:50:40] expressed his word
[1:50:44] and what expressed as a food
[1:50:48] and then remember
[1:50:50] if you were ever was in God's thinking
[1:50:57] you will always be there
[1:51:12] you know
[1:51:15] hahaha
[1:51:16] oh praise the Lord
[1:51:19] that makes you special
[1:51:21] amen amen if you are an attribute of God
[1:51:25] you bring forth the spirit I mean the
[1:51:29] fruit of the spirit
[1:51:30] amen you just Express
[1:51:34] because that's what you are
[1:51:37] you get a seed of a mango in the ground
[1:51:42] it will not struggle to bear fruit
[1:51:45] and when it Bears the fruit it will not
[1:51:49] bring an apple
[1:51:53] you can't be part of the body
[1:51:55] and you are mean
[1:52:04] um
[1:52:16] everybody who touches you goes crying
[1:52:21] that's not an attribute of God
[1:52:29] on the principle
[1:52:31] God works by human embodiments
[1:52:38] so whoever you are
[1:52:41] you become an expression of
[1:52:45] God's Great thoughts
[1:52:48] you are an attribute of your father
[1:52:52] because the jam
[1:52:54] lays in the father
[1:52:59] so you are coming to express God
[1:53:03] that's why you were here
[1:53:06] I come from God
[1:53:08] look at me
[1:53:11] my life would give a testimony
[1:53:14] that's what God wants of us
[1:53:18] let us look at Peter yeah John and James
[1:53:22] all these men are the same Apostolic
[1:53:25] gifts
[1:53:28] but different Administration
[1:53:32] completely but the spirit is the same
[1:53:38] amen amen we can never be the same
[1:53:41] but yet each member in the body Ministry
[1:53:45] is a Divine gift from above
[1:53:50] seek to bless
[1:53:53] don't seek to destroy
[1:53:56] but how can you do it if you come from
[1:54:00] God
[1:54:03] the only thing you carry is to bless one
[1:54:06] another
[1:54:09] are you together with me let us learn to
[1:54:13] yield
[1:54:14] to the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:54:20] Into The Potter's House
[1:54:25] into different verses
[1:54:29] along the way you may sleep and fall
[1:54:34] but when the vessel is broken
[1:54:37] the sister song he doesn't throw in the
[1:54:41] clay he'll bring it back again
[1:54:45] until he gets a verse of Honor
[1:54:50] that's the sign you come from God
[1:54:54] you cannot fall and walk away
[1:54:57] you come and cry back and he'll gather
[1:55:01] back
[1:55:14] he wants to make you a better version of
[1:55:18] love
[1:55:20] strong
[1:55:21] amen he wants us that way
[1:55:25] he's a god of variety
[1:55:28] and he makes some rich
[1:55:34] foreign
[1:56:10] foreign
[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:27] you cannot become crazy like this
[1:56:30] present World against
[1:56:33] God makes you a woman
[1:56:36] but you want to become a man
[1:56:40] you can't be that crazy in the body of
[1:56:43] Christ we accept our positions
[1:56:49] amen amen that's where God can bless you
[1:56:53] if you just can't abide in your position
[1:56:57] the question is did you come from that
[1:57:02] eternity
[1:57:04] foreign
[1:57:11] [Music]
[1:57:18] foreign
[1:57:58] Philadelphia
[1:58:04] when not the same attributes as local
[1:58:07] churches
[1:58:14] but sometimes because we don't know how
[1:58:17] God works
[1:58:19] a man leaves this church
[1:58:22] this that church once he wants to bring
[1:58:26] the attribute of that church into this
[1:58:28] church
[1:58:31] that's not the way God works
[1:58:38] we can never be Jeffersonville it is
[1:58:48] and God has called us to express unique
[1:58:53] attributes
[1:58:55] and as long as your standards who you
[1:58:58] are
[1:58:59] wherever you go
[1:59:03] because you are yourself
[1:59:07] God wants to bless you because you are
[1:59:11] what he means
[1:59:13] you are a blessing to the body
[1:59:18] amen I mean let's go to Ephesians
[1:59:20] chapter four
[1:59:22] verse 5.
[1:59:26] the scripture says
[1:59:29] one Lord foreign
[1:59:49] we go through you know our faith is one
[1:59:53] faith
[1:59:54] our baptism is one baptism
[1:59:58] our bodies one body
[2:00:01] it is
[2:00:07] but as much as is all you know he has
[2:00:12] gifted us differently
[2:00:16] because it's the fullness
[2:00:18] but we are drops from the foreign
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:38] foreign
[2:01:19] everybody has been given something to
[2:01:23] contribute to the body okay some are
[2:01:26] committed to prayer
[2:01:28] and we thank God for that
[2:01:30] summer committed to showing Mercy
[2:01:33] we thank God for that summer blessed
[2:01:40] financially
[2:01:41] to happily bear the financial burdens of
[2:01:45] the church
[2:01:51] it doesn't make you great you are just
[2:01:55] being who you were in the face of God
[2:01:59] Amen but then there is another class of
[2:02:03] gifts
[2:02:04] to the body that Pocus gives us
[2:02:12] Ephesians 4 8.
[2:02:14] wherefore he says
[2:02:19] available
[2:02:28] I trust you brother God is good
[2:02:33] he gave talents back here is
[2:02:42] amen sometimes you may think that it's
[2:02:47] gifts to particular videos
[2:02:51] but verse 11. he says this gives son to
[2:02:56] men
[2:02:57] are given to some to bless the body
[2:03:04] okay verse 11. and he gave some Apostles
[2:03:10] and some prophets and some evangelists
[2:03:14] and some pastors
[2:03:16] and teachers
[2:03:18] these men here they become the gifts
[2:03:34] these gifts
[2:03:43] for the position
[2:03:50] anointed by this and masickling
[2:03:54] anointing
[2:03:56] to be distinguished from the rest of the
[2:03:59] body okay
[2:04:05] to be a minister because as the bride of
[2:04:09] Christ
[2:04:09] we are all women and women don't take a
[2:04:13] pop
[2:04:14] the only reason the fight for takes the
[2:04:26] popsicle in spirit
[2:04:29] that Christ would have done and
[2:04:31] questions
[2:04:43] foreign
[2:05:06] I'm not called to free the gods here
[2:05:10] and I will not fight God
[2:05:15] because these gods
[2:05:17] they will take the time for the ship
[2:05:24] and the Sheep is always
[2:05:27] starving
[2:05:31] because you are taking all the attention
[2:05:34] on the Gods
[2:05:38] the goats don't want to be sheep
[2:05:41] and they will never be shipped they
[2:05:44] never be obedient to the world it
[2:05:46] doesn't matter how much you preach to
[2:05:48] them
[2:05:50] so my choice
[2:05:52] is to work with the ship
[2:05:56] the ship they said Allah that the ship
[2:06:00] May manifest the ministry of Christ
[2:06:03] amen so the motive and objectives
[2:06:08] of this man will always be right
[2:06:15] foreign
[2:06:31] okay sir
[2:06:35] let's go to Revelation chapter 2 verse
[2:06:37] 5.
[2:06:42] he says
[2:06:44] remember therefore
[2:06:46] from where you have fallen
[2:06:54] it's so it's so powerful yeah
[2:07:00] you need to come to a point where
[2:07:04] you know you are standing woman
[2:07:08] [Music]
[2:07:11] because vanga
[2:07:19] the holy spirit is telling the Church of
[2:07:21] Ephesus
[2:07:24] know where you fell from
[2:07:28] a man who has never stood
[2:07:31] does not know what it means to fall
[2:07:36] a sitting man
[2:07:39] cannot fall
[2:07:41] but a standing person
[2:07:45] are you standing this morning
[2:07:49] that's a great blessing
[2:07:51] remember therefore from where you fell
[2:07:55] from
[2:07:57] and repent
[2:07:59] knowing how you deviated from the world
[2:08:04] and come back to the sport
[2:08:07] where you shifted from
[2:08:10] and do the first Works
[2:08:17] love the body be part of the church
[2:08:21] speak well about the blood of Christ
[2:08:31] and you're criticizing everybody
[2:08:36] you can never be the body is
[2:08:43] he says know where you fell from under
[2:08:47] the first works
[2:08:49] I'll come unto thee quickly
[2:08:53] and we remove thy Candlestick out of his
[2:08:57] place
[2:09:01] except you repent
[2:09:06] now
[2:09:07] there are two things here
[2:09:10] there is you the believer
[2:09:14] and then there is
[2:09:24] because it shines the light
[2:09:29] of the revelation of the word of God
[2:09:33] here
[2:09:34] what does this mean that's the ministers
[2:09:46] amen
[2:09:47] he run like this and the poor as much as
[2:09:51] you are willing
[2:09:53] to take so if the church has to be
[2:09:57] blessed
[2:09:58] the people must be like a little eaglets
[2:10:03] because when the mother and God does
[2:10:07] he goes out there he does the hunting
[2:10:11] and when they hear the mothers come down
[2:10:16] having their mouths
[2:10:20] foreign
[2:10:54] I'll take your pastor right away from
[2:10:57] you
[2:10:59] and move him out of his place
[2:11:03] I'll take him somewhere else
[2:11:07] where I will reflect my light that will
[2:11:10] shine
[2:11:16] is the candle to the local church
[2:11:28] he became a blessing
[2:11:31] to the people
[2:11:34] to the church
[2:11:38] when we learn the mystery
[2:11:41] that lays not only in the ministers
[2:11:45] but in each other
[2:11:49] amen and receive one another
[2:11:53] along those lines
[2:11:56] we shall be a blessed local church
[2:12:02] we are all special
[2:12:04] in the eyes of God and we just need to
[2:12:08] discern the body of Christ
[2:12:11] and tap into the Divine Elements
[2:12:16] which every one of us carries
[2:12:20] because
[2:12:24] [Music]
[2:12:29] it's the Fellowship of the attributes
[2:12:36] are you together with the quranism the
[2:12:39] element that comes from God
[2:12:42] that attribute
[2:12:45] drops in my heart
[2:12:47] and I surprised the Lord I'm a Son of
[2:12:51] God and the same attribute falls into
[2:12:55] this heart thank God he's the son of God
[2:12:59] so we have the fellowship
[2:13:02] not Jeremiah and Stephen
[2:13:05] but the attributes of these two here
[2:13:11] sorry
[2:13:35] it's so deep
[2:13:38] and yet so simple to understand
[2:13:42] let us got second Corinthians
[2:13:47] and we shall understand it feed that
[2:13:50] together so for a fellowship
[2:13:54] to shine
[2:13:57] cook Waka with the Light of Christ
[2:14:02] everybody
[2:14:03] needs to make sure
[2:14:06] his leak of fire
[2:14:08] is burning
[2:14:13] and when we come together
[2:14:15] the people will get healed
[2:14:19] from their diseases even without laying
[2:14:23] hands on them
[2:14:27] they've come into presence of a greater
[2:14:30] body of light
[2:14:34] and then all the darkness vanishes
[2:14:38] the Cockroaches will go away
[2:14:42] the reptiles of the night to look away
[2:14:46] the spirits that try to occupy
[2:14:51] somebody's body will go away with your
[2:14:54] mom because he has come into the
[2:14:55] presence of the Divine Light
[2:15:00] a contribution of different attributes
[2:15:06] amen amen second Corinthians

[2:15:20] did you hear that I thought it is
[2:15:24] now we know man after the flesh

[2:15:30] simply because we come to the same
[2:15:33] church

[2:15:38] deeper there must be a light that
[2:15:42] connects your people together
[2:15:46] foreign
[2:16:06] [Music]
[2:16:30] ah
[2:16:31] they always knew him John Peter and
[2:16:35] James and even the Peter could rebuke
[2:16:38] him but when he took them to the Mount
[2:16:42] of transfiguration and unfolded that
[2:16:46] Supernatural attribution
[2:16:55] [Music]
[2:16:57] that has got that attribution
[2:17:01] you are like a spoon of water out of the
[2:17:04] ocean
[2:17:06] that great spirit attribute of Christ
[2:17:11] is the ocean but every one of you has
[2:17:15] got a spoon of it
[2:17:17] and that's what brings our fellowship
[2:17:19] together
[2:17:23] okay
[2:17:24] amen amen God wants us
[2:17:28] to go farther than the Jordan River of
[2:17:31] water baptism
[2:17:34] he wants us to go beyond the Mount of
[2:17:37] Temptation
[2:17:39] where we overcome the last of the flesh
[2:17:44] the last of the eyes and the pride of
[2:17:47] life
[2:18:01] in the power of the Resurrection

[2:18:15] Resurrection are you together with me

[2:18:26] he cannot be part of it that's the type
[2:18:30] of Fellowship we want
[2:18:32] that's the kind of Fellowship we need
[2:18:36] our fellowship

[2:23:33] power voltage and the brother wanted to

[2:26:07] blessings
[2:26:09] to the children of God
[2:26:14] [Music]
[2:26:16] amen amen are you together with me
[2:26:21] so many things have happened by
[2:26:24] releasing that Divine attribute
[2:26:28] that's why I should not be compared to
[2:26:31] anybody
[2:26:33] I'm one of a kind
[2:26:36] and you are one of the kinds
[2:26:39] if we can really come pray that we don't
[2:26:43] understand
[2:26:49] there will always be signs
[2:26:53] Miracles people will go free

[2:27:02] 10.
[2:27:05] the blessing um
[2:27:09] Matthew 10 41.
[2:27:13] he that receiveth a prophet in the name
[2:27:17] of a prophet
[2:27:19] shall receive a prophet's
[2:27:23] and he that receiveth the righteous man
[2:27:28] in the name of a righteous man
[2:27:31] shall receive the righteous
[2:27:35] what are you receiving
[2:27:38] you are receiving another tribute
[2:27:51] Uganda
[2:27:53] and when we receive one another and I
[2:27:56] can start saying because
[2:27:58] along that order
[2:28:00] you receive His blessings
[2:28:05] also pass a blessing to him
[2:28:07] there is something in you I want to

[2:28:27] listen towards one another you shall not
[2:28:31] leave this place
[2:28:51] [Music]
[2:28:57] that is within us to the people
[2:29:28] amen Amina
[2:29:31] amen amen our blessing to you
[2:29:35] my brother is not the Charisma tonight
[2:29:42] amen and it's not in the impact of Our
[2:29:45] Testimony
[2:29:47] but the ability to take ourselves out of
[2:29:52] the way that God himself may have the
[2:29:56] preeminence
[2:29:59] amen amen let me show you here in second
[2:30:03] Corinthians chapter 10.
[2:30:06] about the ministry of
[2:30:08] Paulo brother Olga
[2:30:12] Paul Paolo he says I have learned the
[2:30:15] foundation is
[2:30:18] listen here what is that they are
[2:30:20] talking about him in second Corinthians
[2:30:24] 10 10.
[2:30:25] those who opposed him
[2:30:28] they say for his letters
[2:30:34] his letters for his letter I said they
[2:30:37] are weighted and Powerful
[2:30:43] but his bodily presence is weak
[2:30:48] and this is speech conceptable
[2:30:54] are you seeing the greatest Apostle
[2:30:58] in the history of the church the people
[2:31:01] say when he writes
[2:31:04] you see a powerful man
[2:31:06] but when it comes to you
[2:31:12] Boom come on
[2:31:17] Jesus Christ and he says
[2:31:33] to release that Supernatural elements
[2:31:40] are you together with me what is it
[2:31:42] Paul's bodily Praises
[2:31:50] but he was the greatest blessing to the
[2:31:53] church
[2:31:58] he had the ability to operate by the
[2:32:03] part of God which is in Hebrew
[2:32:06] are you together with me and that part
[2:32:09] and not pause the man
[2:32:19] I mean the lame to work
[2:32:24] so we need to fall back
[2:32:27] into our inner self
[2:32:30] that we can pass on the blessings
[2:32:37] sometimes we make a very big mistake
[2:32:40] we judge people
[2:32:46] that they can preach and dance and do
[2:32:48] all kinds of stuff
[2:32:51] that was not born
[2:32:54] the mystery
[2:32:57] himself was a blessing to the people
[2:33:00] just his presence would release the
[2:33:05] power of God
[2:33:07] and he says
[2:33:09] but Christ not living
[2:33:12] for it's God which worketh in you want
[2:33:16] us to Will and to do of his good
[2:33:18] pleasure
[2:33:22] to bless God's people who have answered
[2:33:26] release your blessings as we are
[2:33:29] speaking
[2:33:45] Lord release my portion of blessings
[2:33:55] not just come and listen to the Past
[2:33:58] number
[2:34:00] you bring a leak of fire
[2:34:03] that must Bless the people
[2:34:06] listen to me now David would release his
[2:34:12] Blessing
[2:34:14] by way of music
[2:34:23] are you together with me the sons of the
[2:34:26] prophets
[2:34:27] release their inner self yes
[2:34:35] he was able to prophesy
[2:34:38] and the people say is so one of the
[2:34:42] prophets also
[2:34:44] but he walked in turn assembly
[2:34:49] where the people were fellowshipping
[2:34:53] by their attribute
[2:34:58] amen I mean the Corinthian Church
[2:35:01] release the blessing of Grace
[2:35:05] until the sinner adults
[2:35:09] would take their blessing yes
[2:35:20] teaches that we should not neglect the
[2:35:23] assembling of ourselves together
[2:35:27] so this message here listen to me is not
[2:35:32] codes of conduct
[2:35:36] that how long should the woman's hair be
[2:35:39] it's more than that how long should the
[2:35:43] woman's Grace be
[2:35:45] it's more than that amen amen I live in
[2:35:49] words talk about dressing one time
[2:35:52] because the women's dresses
[2:35:55] they become tighter all the time
[2:36:03] but yet this message
[2:36:06] is not about how we must dress
[2:36:10] it's not codes of conduct
[2:36:14] so that you can tell a person
[2:36:17] that if you just stay home
[2:36:20] and you listen to the tips
[2:36:28] it's more than that because we can work
[2:36:30] once you listen to the text always the
[2:36:32] same time you are missing my leak of
[2:36:34] fire academy
[2:36:36] you are missing Beatrice's leak of fire
