[31:41] together
[31:43] father Jesus thise amen I don't know if
[31:48] we can get another replacement of
[31:55] this so let us stand to Numbers Chapter
[32:02] 6 Numbers Chapter
[32:05] 6 we're reading from verse 22 to verse
[32:13] 27 the Bible
[32:15] says and the Lord spoke unto Moses
[32:18] saying Speak unto Aaron and unto his son
[32:22] saying on this wise you shall bless the
[32:25] children of Israel saying unto them them
[32:28] the Lord bless the and keep Thee the
[32:31] Lord make his face shine upon thee and
[32:34] be gracious unto thee the Lord lift up
[32:36] his countenance upon thee and give thee
[32:38] peace and they shall put my name upon
[32:41] the children of Israel and I will bless
[32:44] them
[33:25] 27
[33:54] amen praise the name of the Lord seated
[34:02] so I just want to call this text
[34:06] tonight the Lord bless
[34:09] thee amen that is in verse
[34:14] 24 the Bible says the Lord bless
[34:20] thee and keep
[34:22] thee praise the name of the Lord the
[34:25] Lord bless you
[34:29] praise the name of the Lord now in the
[34:34] message as the
[34:39] eest brother Bram
[34:43] says thank you for your
[34:47] kindness for your
[34:49] [Music]
[34:52] offerings and for all you have
[34:56] done then he says I don't know how to
[34:59] say more than
[35:06] that then God bless
[35:11] you andto me that's the greatest word
[35:15] there
[35:17] is if God will bless
[35:22] me everything else will be all
[35:26] right as long as God blesses
[35:29] me praise the name of the Lord you see
[35:32] that's the same
[35:33] thing there is nothing greater than the
[35:36] blessing of
[35:39] God praise the name of our Lord you know
[35:42] the blessings of
[35:44] God the scripture
[35:46] says they make
[35:50] Rich praise the name of our Lord and
[35:53] then they had no sorrow with them
[35:58] they had no
[35:59] sorrow that's what the scripture says I
[36:03] just want to get that scripture in
[36:05] Proverbs chapter
[36:07] 10 and then verse
[36:10] 22 praise the name of our Lord proverbs
[36:14] 10 verse
[36:18] 22 it says the blessings of the
[36:21] Lord it maketh riches and adth no sorrow
[36:25] with it
[36:35] when blesses
[36:36] you it doesn't come with any
[36:40] sorrow it doesn't come with any
[36:43] curse it's a pure
[36:47] blessing praise the name of our Lord and
[36:49] you see the Bible tells us in
[36:53] Genesis that whatever God made
[36:58] it was
[37:00] good
[37:02] everything whatever God
[37:05] made it was
[37:07] good and so it is either us who spoil
[37:11] what God has blessed us
[37:15] with all the people we bring in on
[37:20] board or we allow
[37:23] Satan to come and do things which are
[37:27] not right
[37:29] praise the name of our Lord and then now
[37:31] when we go to Psalms
[37:35] 37 and then verse
[37:38] 22 he says for such as be blessed of him
[37:42] shall inherit the earth and they that be
[37:45] cast of him shall be cut
[37:54] off he says if you are blessed of God
[37:58] you will inherit the
[38:01] earth so you see that everything that
[38:04] there
[38:05] is it is God that has made
[38:09] them it is God that has created them
[38:13] even the Bible tells us we are not of
[38:17] Our
[38:18] Own It Is God that has created
[38:21] us it's God that has made
[38:24] us we are the Sheep of his pass
[38:29] and so we need to recognize
[38:32] that that God blesses
[38:35] us praise the name of our Lord but the
[38:38] challenge is sometimes we limit the
[38:40] blessings of
[38:50] godible says it is God that gives us the
[38:54] Sun every
[38:56] day to make it shine upon the
[39:01] evil it's God who has blessed us with
[39:03] the
[39:04] sun it's God who makes it
[39:07] rain it's God who gives us the breath of
[39:11] life it is God who blesses us with all
[39:14] that we have need
[39:17] of it's God who protects you at
[39:20] night it's God who gives you strength to
[39:23] rise up in the
[39:24] morning it's God who gives you the
[39:26] opportunity
[39:28] of the things that you
[39:31] do praise the name of our Lord the
[39:33] places of
[39:35] work your
[39:37] businesses your
[39:39] Gardens praise the name of our God like
[39:42] there's a place in the town near where
[39:45] I'm
[39:47] staying in the
[39:49] town now there is a por
[39:52] meal I used to stay near that place
[39:54] actually some years ago
[39:58] so now you would pass around that area
[40:00] opposite as you're going
[40:04] home now that por
[40:08] me they
[40:12] por and then they sell it as you know
[40:14] either wholesale or
[40:18] retail and you find many women
[40:21] there each woman with you know her
[40:24] merchandise with her por
[40:29] and then they are sitting outside the
[40:32] POR and all the time they as if trying
[40:35] to talk to
[40:38] somebody each
[40:40] individually and now when you are
[40:42] passing
[40:43] by everybody is saying please come and
[40:46] buy me come and buy me come and
[40:48] buy so you can have your
[40:52] goods but nobody is taking
[40:54] them but you find that you can like you
[40:57] go to the
[40:59] market you find this St has tomatoes and
[41:02] every
[41:05] vegetable even this one here this one
[41:08] here from the
[41:10] entrance up to continue but being at the
[41:15] entrance doesn't mean that you're going
[41:16] to get all those
[41:20] people that's how funny it is somebody
[41:23] will just come and
[41:25] walk you are sing what they
[41:29] but they bypass you then they go to
[41:32] somebody maybe having worse than
[41:37] this others go where many people
[41:40] are then don't want where
[41:44] congestion so it is God who decides who
[41:48] should go
[41:51] where the Bible says the casting of the
[41:56] the dice I think it's called a
[42:01] dice or to cast a
[42:04] vot it is God who deter who is the
[42:08] winner it's God who determines which
[42:11] side like when you have a
[42:14] coin it has a head and a
[42:18] tail so it is God who determines which
[42:21] side is coming up for you throw it
[42:25] up I've lost
[42:28] God has decided
[42:30] that praise the name of he
[42:34] decides praise the name of our Lord
[42:37] there are things you can't humanly
[42:40] determine but God purposes
[42:44] that praise the name of our Lord now in
[42:47] the Book of
[42:50] Daniel Daniel then we read in chapter 4:
[42:53] 16
[43:01] the scripture
[43:03] says let his heart be changed from
[43:06] manies and let a beast heart be given
[43:09] unto him and let seven times pass over
[43:12] him this matter is by decree of the
[43:15] Watchers and the demand by the word of
[43:18] the Holy ones to the intent that the
[43:20] living may know that the most high
[43:23] ruleth in the Kingdom of men and give to
[43:27] ever he will and sets up over it the
[43:30] beest of men

[47:47] ghost he died before those were praising
[47:50] him
[47:53] that praise the name of the same thing

[48:30] animal praise the name of the Lord and
[48:32] the scripture says because he didn't
[48:35] exalt
[48:37] God and so now when God blesses
[48:41] us when God lifts us up in any
[48:44] particular
[48:46] place he gives you a particular

[51:00] see that's how you connect with people
[51:03] if you can get down to their
[51:05] level then they can be free with
[51:08] you but if you're going to be high like
[51:11] this
[51:12] this you know as children of God God
[51:17] expects
[51:18] us to have the meekness of
[51:22] Christ the humility of Christ he would
[51:26] go down to the
[51:28] fisherman sits with them in the
[51:30] boat praise the name of our Lord but is
[51:34] the king of
[51:35] glory the lord of hosts but then he
[51:38] would go down to the levels of
[51:42] people and Paul say I had to become
[51:47] that to win them to the weak I become
[51:52] weak to this one I become this that I
[51:56] may win them to
[51:58] Christ praise the name of the Lord so
[52:01] then God blesses
[52:04] us and whatever we have need
[52:08] of you couldn't have any
[52:12] need if there is no solution to
[52:15] it so whatever need there
[52:18] is God is able to provide for it praise
[52:22] the name of the Lord now in Genesis

[52:28] verse
[52:31] 34 praise the name of our

[53:58] rich but the Bible says even
[54:02] silver it's enough to make you rich but
[54:05] he also gave him
[54:08] gold and he didn't stop at that even
[54:11] gave him

[55:23] camels like would say we have the Cs
[55:27] because he had those
[55:30] camels he could make
[55:34] chariots then he had the
[55:37] asses everything the Bible says God had
[55:43] blessed praise the name of the Lord now
[55:46] the Bible says in John 3:
[55:54] 26 and they came unto John and said unto
[55:58] him Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond
[56:01] Jordan whom thou bearest witness behold
[56:05] the S baptizes and all men come to him
[56:09] John answered and said a man can receive
[56:12] nothing except be given to him from
[56:14] heaven
[56:40] praise the name of the Lord so John
[56:42] answered and
[56:43] say a man cannot receive
[56:47] anything except be given to him from
[56:52] heaven so all that you are is because
[56:56] God has granted you
[56:58] to praise the name of our and all that
[57:01] you
[57:02] desire it's only God who can say okay
[57:04] let it be
[57:07] so praise the name of our Lord and so we
[57:10] need to see that we have confidence in
[57:14] God for our
[57:17] lives every day that you
[57:20] live and God being
[57:23] faithful has given you the life to raise
[57:25] in
[57:27] morning know that there is what God has
[57:32] determined to bless your way praise the
[57:36] name of our Lord so you don't have to
[57:38] live like a
[57:40] dute you know I don't know
[57:43] why you wake up in the morning you are
[57:47] complaining suppos you died at
[57:53] night but you are healthy
[57:57] now I don't have the this week I don't
[58:00] have
[58:01] this now the the month has ended why
[58:05] don't you thank God for what he has made
[58:06] you
[58:09] to praise the name of our why do you
[58:12] have little
[58:15] faith if God has given you the
[58:19] life what is
[58:21] clothing what is
[58:23] clothing let us go to Matthew chapter 6
[58:27] praise the name of the Lord
[58:33] Matthew and then we read
[58:36] from from
[58:42] verse verse
[58:46] 27 which of You by taking thought can
[58:50] add oneit unto his St
[59:07] so you get
[59:10] troubled what am I going to
[59:13] eat what am I going to
[59:16] drink what am I going to dress on it's a
[59:20] new
[59:21] year my clothes are
[59:24] T my Garden has not done well last
[59:30] season School Fe is at the end of this
[59:35] month and then your mind is
[59:40] traveled and then he says can you really
[59:44] add a CH to your St by
[59:49] thinking and Jesus says that is a very
[59:51] small
[59:53] thing and then he says in verse
[59:57] therefore I say unto
[59:59] you take no thought for your
[1:00:05] life what you shall
[1:00:07] eat or what you shall
[1:00:10] drink nor yet for your
[1:00:14] body what you shall put
[1:00:17] on now this is the thing we need to put
[1:00:19] out mind
[1:00:21] on he says is not the life more than
[1:00:30] meat
[1:00:34] and you look at it that way he says the
[1:00:38] life you
[1:00:39] have which is
[1:00:41] important which is important what is
[1:00:44] important the
[1:00:46] life or the
[1:00:50] food which to you is more important
[1:00:56] now if you say
[1:00:59] life then the question is has God given
[1:01:02] you the
[1:01:04] life or you give it to
[1:01:07] yourself praise the name of Lord now if
[1:01:09] God has given you the
[1:01:11] life which is more
[1:01:15] important than the one who has given you
[1:01:18] the
[1:01:18] life you give you the
[1:01:21] food praise the name of that's what he's
[1:01:24] saying the body
[1:01:28] which is more
[1:01:33] important but you not put on if you
[1:01:34] don't have the
[1:01:36] body so he has given you the body so if
[1:01:40] he has given you the body he dress the
[1:01:45] body and he gives
[1:01:47] examples when it comes to dressing he
[1:01:50] says the Le of the
[1:01:53] valley he says Solomon
[1:01:56] in all his
[1:01:58] wisdom he would not dress like the lily
[1:02:01] of the
[1:02:03] V and then brother Bram says the cloth
[1:02:07] of Solomon they never had
[1:02:10] life but the of the valley their beauty
[1:02:15] it was
[1:02:16] life praise the name of our Lord and
[1:02:19] then it talks about the
[1:02:21] birds they don't have Gardens where they
[1:02:24] saw
[1:02:26] they don't have stores where they
[1:02:28] store but it says God fits
[1:02:32] them says you more
[1:02:37] important those
[1:02:39] things praise the name of so then you
[1:02:42] need to have confidence in
[1:02:44] God that as the Lord has brought me this
[1:02:49] far praise the name of the Lord he has
[1:02:52] good plans for
[1:02:54] you he says I know the thoughts I think
[1:02:58] about to bring you to an expected
[1:03:02] end so that you need to have
[1:03:05] confidence in the Lord that will provide
[1:03:09] all that I have need
[1:03:13] of praise the name of our Lord God
[1:03:16] blesses us every
[1:03:18] day He blesses us when you move out He
[1:03:23] blesses you when you come in He blesses
[1:03:26] you it's a continuous blessing from the
[1:03:30] Lord and so we need to see that we thank
[1:03:33] God for
[1:03:34] everything no wonder what the Bible
[1:03:37] says count your
[1:03:40] blessings and you will be
[1:03:43] surprised to see what the Lord Has

[1:03:50] of things he has done for us and a lot
[1:03:53] of things going do for us praise the
[1:03:58] name of Lord let us Goomy CH
[1:04:03] 28 Deuteronomy chapter
[1:04:08] 28 and then we read from verse
[1:04:11] one praise the name of the Lord the
[1:04:14] Bible says and it shall come to
[1:04:17] pass if youen diligently unto the voice
[1:04:21] of the Lord thy God

[1:04:50] thee and over
[1:04:53] thee and you shall if you shall hearen
[1:04:56] to the voice of the Lord your

[1:05:08] you in other words you are just
[1:05:10] surrounded by the

[1:05:25] of God

[1:12:52] kind of different things
[1:12:55] he will bless
[1:12:56] you praise the name of our Lord so you
[1:12:59] don't run from
[1:13:03] this don't get praise the name
[1:13:06] of and you know there is a proverb
[1:13:19] in that you have to change around also
[1:13:23] something like that
[1:13:31] but when God has blessed you
[1:13:34] here he will sustain
[1:13:37] it praise the name of he will sustain it
[1:13:41] that's how the Lord
[1:13:43] does praise the name of our Lord he says
[1:13:46] whatever you put your hand
[1:13:48] on he will bless
[1:13:51] it and he will bless the in the land
[1:13:54] that the Lord has given
[1:13:58] the Lord shall establish the in the
[1:14:01] Unholy people unto
[1:14:06] himself as he has unto
[1:14:09] thee if thou shall keep the Commandments
[1:14:12] of the Lord thy
[1:14:15] God and walk in his
[1:14:18] ways all the people of the Earth shall
[1:14:21] see thee
[1:14:26] that th called by the name of the
[1:14:30] Lord and they shall be afraid of you
[1:14:34] praise the name of the blessings of God
[1:14:38] He blesses
[1:14:40] everything what comes out of your body
[1:14:42] He
[1:14:43] blesses what your hand touches He
[1:14:47] blesses where you live he
[1:14:50] blessings
[1:14:51] everything praise the name of our Lord
[1:14:54] so then we need to
[1:14:55] see that we obey the word of
[1:14:59] God and not only obeying the word of
[1:15:02] God making sure that God
[1:15:06] himself is with you praise the name of
[1:15:10] our Lord Brother
[1:15:12] said that all that I
[1:15:16] need praise the name of Lord if God
[1:15:19] blesses
[1:15:21] me and if he blesses me every
[1:15:27] else will be all right as long as the
[1:15:30] Lord
[1:15:31] bless and that's what we need to be
[1:15:35] certain that the Lord is with
[1:15:38] me the Lord resides in my
[1:15:41] heart the Lord rules in
[1:15:44] myair the Lord rules in my
[1:15:46] family the Lord rules in my
[1:15:49] life so if any sickness
[1:15:52] comes you call upon the name of the Lord
[1:15:56] and the sickness
[1:15:57] goes look what Moses leading 2 million
[1:16:03] people from Egypt to the promised land
[1:16:07] for 40
[1:16:08] years they didn't have tankers of
[1:16:13] water they didn't have they didn't have
[1:16:16] storehouses of
[1:16:19] food they didn't have textile Industries
[1:16:22] to make clothes for them
[1:16:26] they didn't have but the presence of God
[1:16:29] with
[1:16:30] them met every need that they
[1:16:35] had when they needed
[1:16:37] water the Rocks would give the
[1:16:40] water praise the name of the Lord when
[1:16:42] they were in the
[1:16:44] desert you know it is
[1:16:46] interesting it was a pill of fire at
[1:16:50] night what was it doing giving them the
[1:16:53] light
[1:16:55] they didn't have a power Dum there
[1:16:58] hydroelectric Dam
[1:17:02] there give them the light and the
[1:17:06] energy but the pillar of fire give them
[1:17:10] enough
[1:17:11] light and enough
[1:17:15] warms at night then the pillar of fire
[1:17:20] would become a
[1:17:22] cloud and that cloud would be a number
[1:17:26] umbrella the son would not hit
[1:17:30] them just having the presence of God
[1:17:33] with
[1:17:34] you he will take care of
[1:17:39] everything that concerns your
[1:17:41] life we just say Lord come and take
[1:17:45] charge over
[1:17:47] me come and reside in my
[1:17:50] heart come and live in
[1:17:52] me that he can live his own
[1:17:56] life praise the name of Lord in the
[1:17:58] message
[1:18:01] Abraham's he says now we find out he
[1:18:05] says let us get a little backrounds on
[1:18:07] Abraham
[1:18:11] now last night we find that
[1:18:15] Abraham was just an ordinary
[1:18:19] man is that
[1:18:22] right yeah Abra was an ordinary
[1:18:27] man like you like me so God can bless
[1:18:32] any of
[1:18:35] us so you
[1:18:42] don't
[1:18:48] people I'm not
[1:18:53] that even all the They poor no God can
[1:18:59] bless
[1:19:00] you regardless of the family you
[1:19:03] come God can bless you regardless of the
[1:19:08] community you live
[1:19:10] in God can bless you regardless of your
[1:19:14] tribe or your language or
[1:19:18] whatever God can bless you praise the
[1:19:21] name of then he says today when God
[1:19:24] blesses a
[1:19:26] person then the people think he has to
[1:19:29] be a real old
[1:19:38] petul it's just unordinary
[1:19:44] man make him a holy
[1:19:47] man some great some come down through
[1:19:50] generations of holy
[1:19:53] men and has to
[1:19:56] no that is not it so you don't look at
[1:20:00] your
[1:20:05] lineage my grandfather used to sleep
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:10] in my father died without a
[1:20:14] house I think will die on the
[1:20:17] road you don't think like
[1:20:20] that God can turn around
[1:20:25] praise the name
[1:20:26] of
[1:20:29] [Music]
[1:20:31] from to somebody is a prince a
[1:20:35] great praise the name of our lord it's
[1:20:37] just the blessings of God so we
[1:20:40] shouldn't limit
[1:20:42] God sometimes you can limit God by you
[1:20:46] know the opportunities you
[1:20:50] have or maybe by the level of your
[1:20:53] education
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:59] I don't understand things but you find
[1:21:01] who never went School employing
[1:21:06] professors they give them the jobs they
[1:21:09] sign their
[1:21:12] paychecks so you can't say you know that
[1:21:15] thing is
[1:21:18] hard God
[1:21:20] blesses praise the name of He blesses
[1:21:25] you can
[1:21:28] imagineer I wonder when ptif had to
[1:21:31] stand before
[1:21:36] Joseph you can imagine
[1:21:39] that being a slave in P's
[1:21:43] house quite a number of
[1:21:46] years and then one day God lifs
[1:21:50] Joseph and put for us to B down to
[1:21:53] Joseph
[1:21:56] B
[1:21:57] down praise the name just go changed it
[1:22:01] like
[1:22:03] this praise the name of our Lord then
[1:22:07] says the Bible
[1:22:10] sayah was just a man subject to like
[1:22:18] passions as we are he was just a
[1:22:23] man Abraham
[1:22:25] was just a common
[1:22:28] fellow that came down an old man come
[1:22:32] from down from
[1:22:35] Babylon and went down to the land of the
[1:22:40] Char and the City
[1:22:43] of just anary
[1:22:45] man him and his wife probably a poor
[1:22:51] farmer whatever they did for a living
[1:22:55] and when God met
[1:22:57] Abraham he was
[1:23:01] aner praise the name of Lord was an
[1:23:05] Ider but then it pleased
[1:23:09] God to choose
[1:23:11] Abraham and it has pleased God to choose
[1:23:15] Us Praise the name of so you don't put
[1:23:18] yourself out of the
[1:23:21] picture you need to put yourself right
[1:23:23] in the picture
[1:23:26] praise the name of you put yourself
[1:23:29] right
[1:23:30] there praise the name then there is
[1:23:35] another in the message
[1:23:38] influence he says now we find out though
[1:23:43] a good
[1:23:44] man blessed of
[1:23:47] God but if God blesses
[1:23:50] you you stay in the category
[1:24:00] that God has called you
[1:24:04] in he was talking
[1:24:08] about you know he was a great
[1:24:11] king until he did a lot of
[1:24:15] things and his
[1:24:18] influence made Isaiah just Look to
[1:24:22] Him Isaiah could not see
[1:24:27] until
[1:24:29] took then Isaiah about
[1:24:32] the
[1:24:34] so when God blessed
[1:24:38] him he also wanted to go into the PRI
[1:24:45] office
[1:24:48] in so he
[1:24:52] says if it is a
[1:24:56] housewife remain a
[1:24:58] housewife if is a
[1:25:01] business remain in that
[1:25:03] business reflecting
[1:25:05] God whatever God has called you
[1:25:09] to let it be
[1:25:12] that because he wants you to be a real
[1:25:17] housewife reflect your influence upon
[1:25:20] another
[1:25:22] person that would want want to be a good
[1:25:26] hous if you are a good
[1:25:29] businessman let your life be
[1:25:33] so that it will reflect Jesus
[1:25:36] Christ in your
[1:25:38] business praise the name of Lord you
[1:25:41] know
[1:25:43] businessmen they always like
[1:25:45] Propet even the one which is not right
[1:25:47] they want
[1:25:49] it you have given him more money maybe
[1:25:52] you have miscounted and given him more
[1:25:53] money
[1:25:56] he counts it says let me find out is it
[1:26:00] okay and this time maybe he may hide
[1:26:02] where he's counting
[1:26:04] from and then so these not are two but
[1:26:06] he counts as if it is
[1:26:09] one
[1:26:11] yeah you are
[1:26:13] right but he knows that there's some
[1:26:15] extra
[1:26:18] there why don't you declare
[1:26:21] it you've given me more money
[1:26:24] this is all that I need this is your
[1:26:27] money you're reflecting
[1:26:30] Christ praise the name

[1:26:37] not God you've G to a
[1:26:41] sh they have given you
[1:26:44] 5,000 maybe it's at night thinking
[1:26:47] that's
[1:26:49] 2,000 and then the tomatoes are for
[1:26:52] 2,000
[1:26:54] tomatoes are for
[1:26:56] 2,000 okay the Mone is here and then the
[1:26:59] other turns to go away with the
[1:27:03] tomatoes please come there bance
[1:27:09] here praise the name of there's a time I
[1:27:13] went to a market in
[1:27:14] Toro I don't know what I was buying but
[1:27:18] I was buying something I either of G or
[1:27:20] something very expensive
[1:27:24] a qu a
[1:27:27] kilo and then now this person who was
[1:27:30] measuring he got a 200
[1:27:36] g and then he put there then he measured
[1:27:41] then he gave me I said this is what I
[1:27:45] said he said a this thing is 200
[1:27:52] g you know they want make profit even
[1:27:55] they not meant to
[1:27:57] make
[1:27:59] upright you say one
[1:28:02] Kil your scale be one
[1:28:05] k praise the name of don't again put
[1:28:10] excuses you I'm going to pay you 10,000
[1:28:14] today now you see the person has
[1:28:16] finished
[1:28:22] everything but you negotiated
[1:28:27] why do you want to cut
[1:28:28] down why are your scales not
[1:28:32] balancing and the Bible says it's an
[1:28:35] Abomination before
[1:28:36] God so then he
[1:28:41] says if you are a
[1:28:44] businessman let your life be so that it
[1:28:47] reflect Jesus Christ in your
[1:28:50] business with
[1:28:52] honesty and
[1:28:55] [Music]
[1:28:56] and with things that really mean
[1:29:01] something because somebody is watching
[1:29:03] your
[1:29:04] life you are influencing
[1:29:07] somebody God has to be God has to have a
[1:29:11] real
[1:29:13] housewife God has to have a real Teenage
[1:29:16] in
[1:29:19] school God has to have a real
[1:29:22] Minister a real
[1:29:25] businessman somebody that will reflect
[1:29:28] him because there they
[1:29:31] see in you Christ no matter what the
[1:29:36] rest of the world has got to
[1:29:38] do that has nothing to do with
[1:29:42] you oh I we are responsible to
[1:29:47] God for our lives and for our
[1:29:50] experiences with
[1:29:53] Christ praise the name of our so you
[1:29:55] have to reflect Christ in whatever
[1:29:57] you're
[1:29:58] doing you know reflecting the word of
[1:30:02] God like when you read in the
[1:30:05] scriptures I believe it is Ephesians
[1:30:07] chapter
[1:30:10] 6 and you see the Bible gives us
[1:30:14] instructions in verse
[1:30:17] one he says let as many servants as are
[1:30:20] under the Y Count Their Own Masters
[1:30:22] worthy of all
[1:30:32] that the name sorry this is first
[1:30:35] Timothy it is Ephesians chapter
[1:30:41] 6 praise the name of the Lord but
[1:30:44] interesting the scripture concerns that
[1:30:46] what I was was thinking about let us go
[1:30:48] to Ephesians chapter
[1:30:52] 6 he says children obey your
[1:30:58] parents then he talks about
[1:31:01] fathers then ver talks about
[1:31:04] servants then again he talks about
[1:31:08] Masters so he positionally places
[1:31:12] everybody what you are meant to
[1:31:16] do wherever God has blessed you to
[1:31:19] be the work that you're doing the things
[1:31:22] that occupy you
[1:31:30] your be the best at
[1:31:33] that when we come to the services of God
[1:31:37] let us also be diligent in the services
[1:31:39] of
[1:31:41] the knowing that I serve
[1:31:44] God praise the name of if I'm
[1:31:47] responsible for
[1:31:49] equipment let me do it
[1:31:51] Faithfully if I'm responsible for
[1:31:54] music let me be faithful in it if
[1:31:57] responsible
[1:31:59] preaching let me be faithful in it if
[1:32:02] I'm responsible for arranging this
[1:32:04] place let me be faithful for it if I'm
[1:32:07] responsible for the fs of the
[1:32:10] church faithful in it whatever God has
[1:32:14] blessed us to
[1:32:16] do you are serving the lord and then you
[1:32:20] do it reflecting Christ in your
[1:32:24] and that's how the Lord
[1:32:30] blesses when you are Faithfully serving
[1:32:33] him in what he has put before
[1:32:36] you praise the name of our Lord and
[1:32:39] keeps on blessing
[1:32:40] you and now the blessings are not only
[1:32:44] limited to the physical
[1:32:47] things but good health is a
[1:32:51] blessing While others are falling sick
[1:32:54] all the
[1:32:55] time God blesses you with
[1:32:58] good the other person may be earning a
[1:33:00] lot of
[1:33:02] money but alls up in hospital
[1:33:05] build and when you have a sick child you
[1:33:09] can never have
[1:33:11] peace praise the name of but here
[1:33:14] there's no sickness at
[1:33:16] home you happy some of these are
[1:33:19] spending a lot to get a small piece
[1:33:27] but now God's presence is with
[1:33:30] you whatever you have need you may not
[1:33:33] have the money but you see God opening
[1:33:37] opportunity and you get
[1:33:39] it you don't have F
[1:33:44] accounts but God knows when you have
[1:33:47] need of
[1:33:48] this his
[1:33:51] supplies praise the name of our Lord
[1:33:53] they needed the
[1:33:55] water God would cause water come out of
[1:33:57] The
[1:33:58] Rock when they needed the
[1:34:03] heat the pill of fire was there when
[1:34:06] they needed the
[1:34:08] shade the cloud was
[1:34:12] there
[1:34:15] everything and brother Bram says they
[1:34:18] were under do
[1:34:21] Moses and his medicine was
[1:34:25] the Lord heals all your
[1:34:28] diseases they worked for 40
[1:34:30] years their souls were not
[1:34:37] swollen their shes never got
[1:34:40] T their clothes never got
[1:34:44] Tor I wonder what kind of material that
[1:34:48] was these days you buy a
[1:34:51] shoe you put it on
[1:34:54] and then when you are
[1:34:56] walking it goes
[1:34:59] off then you start seeing somebody
[1:35:01] carrying shoes in the
[1:35:06] hand you buy a shirt
[1:35:10] or and sometimes you can't sit in a
[1:35:13] tax and some of those taxes have Shar
[1:35:18] points when you when you get up to get
[1:35:20] somebody come out
[1:35:27] but these ones 40
[1:35:29] years their cloth is Never B
[1:35:32] out praise the name of our Lord so we
[1:35:35] just need to see that the Lord is with
[1:35:39] us and the Lord really blesses
[1:35:42] us then let us continue in that message
[1:35:44] influence
[1:35:47] 54 which we read before then he says now
[1:35:51] we find out that in his trying to take a
[1:35:54] Minister's
[1:35:57] place and someone telling him he's out
[1:35:59] of
[1:36:01] place telling him he shouldn't do that
[1:36:04] he out of place he became
[1:36:10] angry so he wased until his face
[1:36:16] turned so even in our
[1:36:18] service we need
[1:36:21] humility praise the name of the Lord
[1:36:24] allow to be
[1:36:26] corrected where you are doing wrong and
[1:36:29] you take it in good
[1:36:30] faith praise the name of our and you
[1:36:33] know like maybe you are the only person
[1:36:35] doing
[1:36:36] something and then they tell this thing
[1:36:38] is not
[1:36:39] right don't say next week I'm not going
[1:36:42] to be
[1:36:43] around let them know that I'm the only
[1:36:45] person who can do
[1:36:47] that you don't do
[1:36:50] that you humble yourself
[1:36:53] take the correction in
[1:36:58] good you don't say that I'm nobody else
[1:37:02] can do
[1:37:03] it that church is depending on
[1:37:07] me praise the name of Lord you know you
[1:37:10] be
[1:37:11] humble and the scripture says if you
[1:37:14] humble
[1:37:15] yourself then the Lord
[1:37:18] exalts praise the name of our but then
[1:37:20] if you exalt
[1:37:22] yourself then the
[1:37:25] Lord praise the name of our Lord so you
[1:37:28] just need to see that you serve the
[1:37:30] Lord with all your
[1:37:32] heart all the ability the Lord has
[1:37:36] given the humility that required of
[1:37:41] us knowing that we are serving
[1:37:45] God praise the name of our Lord that's
[1:37:47] what we
[1:37:48] need our time is running fast and I have
[1:37:51] to cut short many things
[1:37:55] now let us just get into another
[1:37:57] Direction
[1:38:00] here now let us in the scriptures which
[1:38:03] we first
[1:38:04] read the Bible says in Numbers Chapter
[1:38:10] 6 and then verse
[1:38:12] 22 the Lord spoke unto Moses saying
[1:38:16] Speak unto Aaron and his son saying on
[1:38:19] this wise you shall bless the children
[1:38:21] of Israel saying
[1:38:36] them now you see that in the next three
[1:38:42] verses the Lord bless you and keep
[1:38:46] you the Lord make his face shine upon
[1:38:49] you and be gracious unto you
[1:38:54] the Lord lift up his continence upon you
[1:38:56] and give you
[1:38:59] peace there's nothing like money
[1:39:02] mentioned
[1:39:03] here there's nothing like mentioned
[1:39:07] here there's nothing like animals or
[1:39:12] what but the blessing
[1:39:15] here is God
[1:39:18] himself to be reflected in your
[1:39:20] life praise the name of our Lord he
[1:39:24] reflects in your
[1:39:25] life by keeping you he reflects in your
[1:39:30] life by his glory upon your
[1:39:33] life he reflects in your life by the
[1:39:37] favor that he gives you
[1:39:40] thece people will be
[1:39:42] surprised how you handle
[1:39:45] things said ah I wish I could do way he
[1:39:49] does
[1:39:49] it people will be surprised
[1:39:53] how you overcome
[1:39:56] Temptations people will be surprised it
[1:39:59] is Grace that God gives
[1:40:01] you like
[1:40:03] Joseph God blessed the house of
[1:40:07] ptif because of Joseph but you look at
[1:40:10] the Temptation that came to
[1:40:12] Joseph it was the grace of God to
[1:40:16] overcome that Temptation so God blesses
[1:40:19] us with his presence
[1:40:23] that whatever you have need
[1:40:26] of praise the name of the Lord He
[1:40:29] blesses
[1:40:30] it it whatever comes out of your
[1:40:34] mouth comes to
[1:40:37] pass praise the name of the Lord so at
[1:40:39] our
[1:40:41] families don't start cursing your
[1:40:44] children but bless your
[1:40:46] children praise the name of our Lord
[1:40:49] tell them what you want them to
[1:40:51] be and
[1:40:54] they can what
[1:40:57] [Music]
[1:40:58] you that this child is
[1:41:02] stupid he has done something
[1:41:05] stupid he has done something stupid even
[1:41:09] if he has done something
[1:41:11] wrong encourage them to do
[1:41:14] better not to condemn
[1:41:16] them no wonder you have done
[1:41:19] this because you are
[1:41:21] foolish no
[1:41:24] lift them up out of that
[1:41:27] Str you can do
[1:41:29] better you have
[1:41:32] Tred
[1:41:34] continue praise the name of the Lord so
[1:41:37] now he says tell speak to the sons of
[1:41:39] Aon and his
[1:41:42] sons Aon and his sons were
[1:41:46] priests so he was telling the
[1:41:49] priesthood to bless the children of
[1:41:51] Israel
[1:41:54] and then now when we go in the Book of
[1:41:59] Malachi Malachi
[1:42:07] chapter let us read verse
[1:42:11] one it says and now all you pre the
[1:42:15] Commandment is for
[1:42:20] you if you will not hear and if you'll
[1:42:24] not lay it to the heart to give Glory
[1:42:26] unto my name sayith the Lord of hosts I
[1:42:29] will even send a curse upon you and I
[1:42:32] will cast your blessings yeah I have
[1:42:35] casted them already because you not lay
[1:42:37] it to heart
[1:43:10] so he says that the priests had
[1:43:14] blessings they would Bless the
[1:43:17] people but when the priesthood turned
[1:43:19] away from the word of
[1:43:22] God would don't Bless the
[1:43:24] people instead the
[1:43:26] blessings becomes a
[1:43:29] cur and these are the
[1:43:31] places where the message of the hour is
[1:43:34] not
[1:43:36] preached instead of blessing the people
[1:43:39] with eternal
[1:43:42] life people get into
[1:43:45] bondage praise the name of our Lord but
[1:43:48] where the word of God is
[1:43:52] ministered it's a
[1:43:54] blessing praise the name of our Lord we
[1:43:56] are
[1:43:57] blessed so whenever we come to church we
[1:44:00] come to receive
[1:44:02] blessings praise the name of no the
[1:44:05] Bible say should not avoid assembling
[1:44:09] together sometimes you can come when you
[1:44:13] weak but when you attend a
[1:44:15] service you find you've been forgotten
[1:44:18] that you were
[1:44:19] weak you come when you are troubled
[1:44:23] when you have come in the presence of
[1:44:25] God all those fears you had
[1:44:28] go like
[1:44:30] Jacob praise the name of the Lord when
[1:44:33] he was moving from from lean's
[1:44:38] place was going to the land of
[1:44:40] promise he was afraid to meet his
[1:44:46] brother until he met an angel at
[1:44:49] night and he wrestled with the angel
[1:44:53] and then the angel said let me go before
[1:44:55] it is
[1:44:57] bright that following
[1:45:00] day Jacob was able to meet his brother
[1:45:04] Esa without any
[1:45:06] fear all the fear had gone away the
[1:45:10] protection of God was
[1:45:12] upon that's when we also come to the
[1:45:15] services of the Lord praise the name of
[1:45:18] our Lord He blesses us praise the name
[1:45:21] of our Lord he takes away your fears he
[1:45:25] takes away your
[1:45:26] diseases he opens doors for you he gives
[1:45:30] you a better
[1:45:32] understanding praise the name of our now
[1:45:34] in verse
[1:45:35] seven the Bible says for the LIF for the
[1:45:39] priest's lips should keep knowledge and
[1:45:42] they should seek the law at his mouth
[1:45:44] for he is the messenger of the Lord of
[1:45:46] host
[1:45:54] [Music]
[1:46:02] praise the name of he say the messenger
[1:46:04] of
[1:46:06] God the priest is the messenger of
[1:46:10] God so he must have the mind of
[1:46:13] God he must know the will of
[1:46:17] God praise the name of you know like
[1:46:20] there are many challenges we Face
[1:46:22] through in life
[1:46:24] you may have your own
[1:46:27] understanding but now when you go to the
[1:46:31] P he has a
[1:46:36] better you may be thinking this way
[1:46:40] thinking you are right but now when you
[1:46:43] come and
[1:46:44] consult it gives you a better view of
[1:46:47] the
[1:46:49] issue praise the name of our so don't
[1:46:56] offer praise
[1:46:59] the you have your own thing disturbing
[1:47:02] you you hold it
[1:47:04] there you get ccel from your friends
[1:47:07] neighbors or
[1:47:13] colleagues because there is wisdom that
[1:47:16] God gives the
[1:47:18] minister over an
[1:47:21] issue and now when you come before a
[1:47:24] pastor praise the name of you know there
[1:47:27] are some issues people hold for
[1:47:31] themselves they just dodge
[1:47:36] around but if the pastor cannot sa
[1:47:41] Vision he will base on what you are
[1:47:43] telling
[1:47:44] him and then he gives you the Cel but
[1:47:47] then the right thing you are holding it
[1:47:49] the other side
[1:47:54] you just you just set the small
[1:47:57] thing and then the other right you're
[1:48:02] holding like there's a person who
[1:48:06] came telling me about their past
[1:48:10] life how they got
[1:48:13] saved said okay but God is
[1:48:18] gracious and then but the statement the
[1:48:20] person
[1:48:21] said and I was
[1:48:24] like but it was like an idol
[1:48:28] statement but I said anyway maybe I P
[1:48:30] left it there but I just said okay just
[1:48:33] keeping Christ and everything now after
[1:48:36] two
[1:48:37] years you get the true
[1:48:41] story of what she was telling
[1:48:44] you I said but why didn't he tell at
[1:48:47] this
[1:48:49] time but now the thing has become worse
[1:48:52] than it was
[1:48:56] and somebody doesn't come to
[1:48:59] church because of the background they
[1:49:02] went
[1:49:03] through but they couldn't seek cancel
[1:49:06] out be helped out
[1:49:10] of so we need to see that you are
[1:49:14] open be
[1:49:16] sincere and say okay this is the thing
[1:49:19] this is the thing this is the thing and
[1:49:22] then you can can be
[1:49:24] helped praise the name of the Lord so
[1:49:26] the scriptures told
[1:49:28] us
[1:49:31] that that because people seek the law at
[1:49:35] his
[1:49:39] mouth what is the mind of God about
[1:49:44] my because God has
[1:49:47] anointed and there are things you can
[1:49:49] see different from what you can see

[2:00:07] 16 and then verse
[2:00:12] 17th 16 and verse 17
[2:00:17] to8 and Jesus answered and said unto
[2:00:20] him blessed
[2:00:23] though
[2:00:25] Simon for flesh and blood has not
[2:00:28] revealed it unto
[2:00:31] you but my Father which is in
[2:00:35] heaven
[2:00:37] Revelation is a
[2:00:39] blessing when God makes himself known
[2:00:42] unto
[2:00:44] you I believe that's the greatest
[2:00:46] blessing that
[2:00:48] we we are here in church because
[2:00:52] God has made himself known
[2:00:55] Us Praise the name of there is no
[2:00:58] greater blessing than
[2:01:01] that other M will
[2:01:07] disapp come for
[2:01:09] name but when God makes himself known
[2:01:12] unto
[2:01:14] you nobody can take it from
[2:01:16] you no situation can take it from you no
[2:01:20] circumstance can take it from
[2:01:23] so
[2:01:26] personal praise the name of the Lord
[2:01:29] Joseph was
[2:01:30] Brethren they thought they would take
[2:01:32] that from
[2:01:33] him let him take let usell him or kill
[2:01:37] him and see what will come of his
[2:01:41] dreams they didn't know they were
[2:01:43] promoting the
[2:01:46] dream praise the name said how can
[2:01:50] we our
[2:01:54] to down
[2:01:56] your how can we
[2:02:00] Stars the moon the sun go down before
[2:02:07] your they wouldn't take it away from
[2:02:10] Joseph praise the name of the Lord so we
[2:02:13] need to desire God to reveal himself to
[2:02:17] us and when God reveals himself
[2:02:22] it gives you
[2:02:24] strength until the Bible
[2:02:26] says that the Gates of
[2:02:29] Hell shall not Prevail against it
[2:02:33] doesn't matter how much the Devil May
[2:02:36] fight the devil can fight
[2:02:39] you for your understanding of the word
[2:02:43] of the Revelation that God has given the
[2:02:47] devil can fight
[2:02:48] you praise the name of our for the life
[2:02:51] that God has given
[2:02:53] you a life where you are submissive to
[2:02:57] God the life of God flowing in
[2:03:00] you maybe as a sister at a place of
[2:03:04] work a sister in a place of
[2:03:06] work the fear of God has made you dress
[2:03:12] right you don't add makeup on
[2:03:15] yourself then the fellow women start
[2:03:17] despising
[2:03:19] you all talking against you
[2:03:24] why do you want to with her hear
[2:03:31] what that
[2:03:34] woman she's a special one
[2:03:37] then that one is like an old
[2:03:41] woman because you're not doing what they
[2:03:45] doing but whatever they will say will
[2:03:48] not take what you
[2:03:50] are instead the
[2:03:52] talk is the more you are you are lifted
[2:03:57] up praise the name of our they can't
[2:04:00] take it from you the grace that God has
[2:04:03] given you to live a true Christian
[2:04:07] Life praise the name of the Bible
[2:04:10] says Gates of
[2:04:13] Hell shall not Prevail against you
[2:04:16] praise the name of our Lord and that's
[2:04:18] what we should be the most important
[2:04:19] thing before God
[2:04:23] make yourself known to me let me know
[2:04:26] your
