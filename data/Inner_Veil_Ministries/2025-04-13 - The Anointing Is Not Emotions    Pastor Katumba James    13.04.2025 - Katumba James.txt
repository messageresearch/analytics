Let us have a word of prayer. Father, we thank you for this afternoon, for the grace you've given us to come back again. We pray that Lord, you may speak to us according to your divine purpose and will given us upon this service and Lord may bless our hearts Lord. We also fill our hearts with your holy spirit as we are expecting from you Lord. We love you Lord and bless you. In the name of the Lord Jesus we grant us this. Amen. Amen. Let us turn to 1 Samuel chapter 16 and then verse 11 verse 13. Amen. Amen. The Bible says, "And Samuel said unto Jesse, here are all thy children." And he said, "There remainth yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep." And Samuel said unto Jesse, "Send and fetch him, for we will not sit down till he come hither. And he sent and brought him in. Now he was rudy and wither of a beautiful countenance and good to look to. And the Lord said, "Arise and anoint him, for this is he. Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. And the spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Rama. May God sing of his word. Praise and you may be seated. So I want to talk on anointing. The anointing is not emotions. Praise the name of the Lord. You know we are used to that where people think that when one is anointed or what we think that when somebody is anointed they are so much emotional. No wonder the trend of emotions as evidence of the Holy Spirit takes many people's mind and you know some people when they are seeking for the baptism of the Holy Spirit they are looking for how they are going to feel or some kind of emotion and then you people can start explaining how they felt or what they did and then they give you that that that is the evidence that I've got the baptism of the Holy Spirit and somebody wants you to ask you what's the time what was this and if you can't tell him that said you have never but anoint ointing is not emotions. Now in the message why are people so tossed about? Brother Brham says some people get the wrong impression of what the anointing is. Did you ever think of that? When was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone? And what did they do when they had that anointing? The greatest anointing that was ever give to anyone was Jesus Christ. We've we have the spirit by measure, but he had it without measure. And one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read and said, "The spirit of God is upon me, for he has anointed me. to preach the acceptable young to bind up the broken hearts, to heal the sick, give sight to the blind. Now, he's talking about Christ. Nobody had anointing like Christ had the anointing because our Lord Jesus Christ. He had the anointing of the Holy Spirit. without measure because he was the fullness of the godhead body and he was the Christ, the anointed one, the Messiah. So he was anointed above anyone else. And so now one day Jesus went into the synagogue in the book of Luke 4. And the Bible says, they gave him the book of Isaiah. And when he got the portion which was in Isaiah chapter 61 verse one and verse two then he says Luke 4:18 the spirit of the Lord is upon me. He has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives. And recovering of sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bruised. to preach the accept of the Lord. And he closed the book. And he gave it to the minister and sat down. And the eyes of them were all in the synagogue were fastened on him. 19. He began to say, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your eyes." All that bear him witness that the gracious ones which proceeded out of his mouth and said, "Is not this Joseph's son? He says, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me." The whole anointing. So he goes in the synagogue. He gets the scroll of Isaiah. And then he reads it before them and say this day this scripture is fulfilled. And after reading it, he goes and sits down. Praise the name of our Lord. He didn't start running around. No, just sat down. And then brother Brennham says in that message, why are people so tossed about? And now we would think if such anointing was on him that had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come. And here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him. We would run all over the building, scream and horror, but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down and precious words proceeded out of his mouth. Then brother Brham says that's what he done under the anointing. So then our mind should totally go out of emotions for approve of anointing. Praise the name of the Lord. You know some people get worked up and then you know they would want to just do this and then say I think that's anointing. Praise the name of you know sometimes we get mistaken. This was a this was this is an illustration. We had a sister some time ago. Praise the name of our Lord and then we were in worship. It's not bad to worship freely. It's not bad to raise your hand when you are worshiping or crying when you are woring or shouting when you are washing. Nothing wrong with that. Praise the name of our Lord. And it's nothing wrong with running around if you do it in order. Nothing wrong with that. But now the sister was busy praying and you know like somebody who really who has the anointing or so on fully given in then the following day divorced. Now you then you start wondering and the divorce is not that I'm leaving but I'm getting married to another person and you start wondering was that person genuine? Praise the name of our so the anointing brother Brham talks about Because the anointing is not emotions. The anointing is supreme power in control. In other words, if you are anointed, you know what you are doing. When you are anointed, praise the name of our Lord. God takes charge over your life. And when God is taking charge over your life, you'll do that which is right. And then he says like knowing exactly what and how and that is what is here. And he was talking this when a sister had just come out of a wheelchair and then she was moving around. Then he said this is the anointing. So it was not about running about doing this and this. And you know there are some people who seek the baptism of the Holy Spirit or they look and then they are looking for some emotion, some sensation. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Praise the name of our Lord. Let me read it here. It says just beg your pardon here. That is some of the mysteries that this angel is supposed to wind up. All the mystery, all the mysteries of God and the other. May I say this with reverence not referring to myself but referring to the angel of God. The serpent is seed that has been hidden mystery all through the years. The grace straightened out, not this grace, but real true grace. No such a thing as eternal. You will burn for millions of years. But anything that was eternal had never a beginning or end. And hell was created, all these mysteries, the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation. but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did. Now, brother Brandham is saying part of the mysteries to be revealed by the seventh angel under under the opening of the seven seals was the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Spirit without any sensation without any emotion. Praise the name of our Lord. That's now part of the third book. Praise the name of our Lord. Where the Holy Spirit comes down to your soul and your soul has one sense. Praise the name of our Lord. Faith or doubt. And the Holy Ghost to come down to the soul. One must be predestinated to eternal life. Praise the name of our Lord. He has to be predestinated to eternal life. Now in the message leadership, brother Brandham says, he says many many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I'm going to heaven. That don't mean one thing that you are going to heaven. No sir, you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell. The Bible says so. Some of these are hard words to say, but you need to get the understanding. The mind of brother Brham. The mind of brother Brham when he was bringing this thing. Now in the message you know he preached this about four series of messages. In December of 1965 praise the name of our Lord. In December of 1965, actually there were some of the last sermons brother Brandham preached. Praise the name of our Lord. So on 4th of December 1965 he preached the message Rapture. It was in a place called Yuma. He talked about this. Then the following day, 5th of December, he preached in another place called Royalta and he preached on the message things that are to be. And then the following day, 6th of December, he preached a message, modern events are made clear by prophecy in San Bido. He talked about December and then the following day 7th of December 1965 he in a place called Vina he preached the message leadership the quote I've read but now let us go in the message modern events are made clear by prophecy in paragraph 100 he says there are many people just can't believe it even spiritfilled people I am going to give you one that will choke you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you are going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul. Now you're seeing how he's completely placing it. He says if it doesn't go to your soul, then you are lost. Much as you say, I was filled with the Holy Ghost. But if the soul never got that spirit of God says you're not going anywhere. So he says see here is the inside soul that has to come from God. But then on the outside you have five senses. You contact your earthly home. The inside you have the spirit and in there you have five outlets conscious and love and so forth. Five outlets to that spirit. Remember that in that spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of God and be lost. It is the soul that lives and was a dain of God. He makes it clear here in the soul there is no emotion. But on the human spirit you can become emotional. You can prophesy because the spirit has come down to your human spirit. You can see visions. You can speak in tongues. You can do all those kind of things. But then he says if you receive the Holy Ghost and just goes to the spirit, you can have all those emotions and sensations and you are lost. Praise the name of our Lord. But we need the baptism of the Holy Spirit to go to the soul. And that's where the life, eternal life is. So when he says the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Spirit without sensation is meaning the baptism of the Holy Spirit, going to the soul. Praise the name of our Lord. Going to the soul. You can have the spirit come and and then make you do many different things. How about inside the soul? And that's now where the third pull is. The revealing of the word. The first pull was on the body. He would touch somebody's hand. He uses his left hand, touch somebody's right hand. And then he would have vibration. He tells him what sickness he has. He prays for him. The vibration stops in the hand. Then he declares him that you are healed. First pull. And that attracts so many people. Then the second pull was the discernment of spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. And then the third pull is the revealing of the word and that's where the elect is caught and that's what we get a hold of. Praise the name of our lord. So now we see also in this message let me get this message here. Praise the name of our Lord in the message and knows it not. He says and now the reason that people today now don't forget this now and you'll see what the holy you'll see what the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is. Now people can live in this spirit. That's the human spirit. And they dance in the spirit. They shout in the spirit. They go to church in the spirit. And they can absolutely have the spir the real spirit of God anointed on that human spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. And you see this is where the falsely anointed ones comes in. They anointed by the Holy Spirit, but they are wrong. Matthew 24:4, they can do those miracles, wonders, signs, but they don't obey the word. the same thing. Look what Balam with the spirit of God and trying to do stumbling for Israel. Look what the spirit came upon him and he prophesied but he condemned Christ to death. So you see we need to be very careful. And you see many people they think that they can get the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit without obedience to the word. They demean the word. But if the spirit speaking the word and then you want the spirit and you're rejecting what the spirit is telling you, you'll go to the side of the rebellious also because the Bible says even the rebellious he gives them gifts. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to the book of Psalms. Just want to get that scripture here. It says even the rebellious praise the name of our Lord. The book of Psalms. Let me get that scripture right now. Psalms chapter 68. And then verse 18 he says, "Though hast ascended on I and th has led captive captivity, you thou hast received gifts for men." Yeah. For the rebellious also that the Lord God might dwell among them. Praise the name of Lord. So we need to see how to get the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit. Receive the word, obey the word because the word goes to the soul. And when the word is in the soul, then the Holy Spirit will follow the word where it is stationed in the soul. Praise the name of our Lord. And that's the baptism that we want in our lives. If really God has filled me with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is in my soul, I will have no hatred for another person, I will not have. Praise the name of the Lord. But then you get somebody saying I have the spirit of God. But when it comes to hatred, start wondering how do you have the spirit and you can afford to hate. How? That means you just got the spirit on your human spirit and then you will prophesy or you became so emotional or you ran around but the life you live doesn't match with your testimony. Praise the name of our Lord. Now that should not be our desire. Our desire should be the life of Jesus Christ himself in us. Praise the name of the Lord. And then we shouldn't pretend because one would be wasting their time. Why would I pretend that I'm I'm saved? Why should I pretend that I'm a message believer? Without the life of Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. So he continue send a message and knows it not because watch that's the reason you couldn't tell that woman she was wearing shorts was wrong. You don't tell her bobbing her hair was wrong. Well that's that's what your hair got to do with it. Well, it did to Samson. So he said they they said they have their spirit but then they deny the word. They reject the word. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says they have a form of godliness, you know, but they deny the power, the power of transformation which will change their lives. Praise the name of our Lord. So we see that anointing is not emotions. When David was anointed, he didn't start running around. No, when Christ was standing in the synagogue as calm as he could be but with all the anointing on him in Acts chapter 9. Praise the name of our Lord. Acts chapter 9 and then we read from verse verse 17. And anas went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as you came has sent me that you might receive your [Music] sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost. Now, Ananas was sent by God to lay his hands on Saul so that Saul's eyes could be opened and soul should be filled with the Holy. Now in verse 18, and immediately dam fell from his eyes as it had been scales, and he received sight forth with, and arose, and was baptized. And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then soul was certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus. Praise the name of our Lord. You know this scripture here the Bible says anas laid his hands on. And when he laid his hands on Saul, the eyes scales came from the eyes. And Saul was able to see. But he anas was saying to lay hands. So that two things are fulfilled. The eyes are open and soul is filled with the Holy Ghost. So the question is, was soul filled with the Holy Ghost? There's no emotion here. Nothing. Praise the name of our Lord. There was no emotion at all. There was no sensation at all when Saul was filled with the Holy Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, brother Brham, they spoke these things by inspiration. Praise the name of our Lord. and he took us back to the Bible. Praise the name of our Lord. And even when you see the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the book of Acts, you'll find that on the day of Pentecost, praise the name of our Lord, when the Holy Spirit came down as a sound of mighty wind and then it filled the house where they were. And then the Bible says, you know, there appeared tanks of fire. You know, a tongue of fire. It's just like when you light a candlestick over and then under when you see that that kind of fire turning the tongue of fire it was a fire that like a form of fire appearing on their head and the Bible says a tongue. In other words, the Holy Spirit divided himself and then they were getting a portion of the Holy Spirit on each of them. And now when the the spirit settled on them, the Bible says their tongues were quickened and then they started speaking with other tongues. On the day of Pentecost, the ears they had that sound in the room. The body felt like goose pimples. The eyes they saw tongs of fire on each other's head. Then the body, their tongues were quickened. So you see that on the day of Pentecost literally every part had emotion. There was a lot of sensation. Praise the name of our Lord. The eyes saw the body fell. The tongue was picking. But now when you see what happened on the day of Pentecost, the emotions which on day of Pentecost are not necessarily the same everywhere. When you follow the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the book of Acts, you not see another place where there are tongues of fire on their [Music] head. Do you mean they never got baptized with the Holy Ghost? In some other places, you don't hear that there was sound of a mighty wind coming. Do you mean they never received the Holy Ghost? In some places, they never prophesy. Do you mean they never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Then in some places there was no emotion. Do you mean they never got the B of the Holy Ghost? Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us go back to that message. He says, "The mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation." But the proof that one has the Holy Ghost is the presence of the person of Christ in their life. So the question is if I want to prove whether I have the spirit of God or I don't have the spirit of God is Christ inside of you that should be the proof to you because if Christ is inside of you you'll obey his word. Praise the name of our Lord. You'll follow the word and you'll desire the word as so much because it is part of you or you are part of him. Praise the name of Lord. So you don't go by any emotion and you don't base on any emotion to prove that you have the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But let it be the life of Jesus Christ because you can have emotions when the Holy Ghost stopped on the human spirit. If the Holy Ghost goes to the soul, the question is is there an emotion in the soul? There's nothing. Praise the name of our Lord. So anointing is not emotion like here David. He was anointed and he stayed the way he was. But the Bible says the Holy Spirit came on him. He never prophesied. He never ran around. One was saying he did it but they didn't write it. Why do you want me to believe what what you are saying which is not written? You know people who like emotions they want to put it there. It happened but they did not write it. You don't even got the spirit but they didn't write it. Why do you want us to believe what was not written when what was written is there? And we have witnesses of this. Praise the name over and the Bible says a witness of two or three. Let it be established. We have David here a witness anointed without any emotion. We have Paul here anointed without any motion filled with the Holy Ghost without any emotion. Praise the name of our Lord. We have Christ when he was filled with the Holy Ghost on river Jordan. Did he prophesy? Did he run in the water around? Praise the name of our Lord. Three witnesses. So don't allow somebody to deceive you that because you've not felt any emotion, you don't have the Holy Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. Even brother comes back and says the same thing the God revealed. Praise the name of our Lord. You know some people they want to look at emotion and then look you at emotion. Praise the name of our Lord. There's one who had those things and then at the end of the day they realized that they don't have the Holy Spirit. But they were caught up here. But where is the life of Jesus Christ? That's what you should look for. And to get the life of Jesus Christ, receive the word. Obey the word. It's not difficult. Praise the name of our Lord. So emotion, anointing is not emotion. David was anointed. There was no emotion. Jesus was filled with the Holy Ghost. No emotion. Paul was filled with the Holy Ghost. No emotion. Maybe you may say maybe they never had a spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. But here Jesus with the whole anointing. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the book of Acts chapter 10 and verse 38 the Bible says how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost with power who went about doing and healing all that were oppressed of the devil. For God was with him. praise the name of our Lord, he was anointed. Then in the book of Hebrews chapter 1 and then verse 8 verse9 the Bible says but unto the but unto the son he saith thy throne oh God is forever and ever except of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdoms [Music] Though hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity, therefore God, even thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. Praise the name of our God. He says he was anointed above his fellows. Praise the name of our Lord. So anointing is not emotions. In the Old Testament, they would anoint with oil. In the New Testament, it is the Holy Spirit which is the anointing. Praise the name of our Lord. It's the Holy Ghost that's the anointing. And so the Holy Ghost come down in our lives. We hear the word of God. We obey the word of God. We say, "Lord, here I am." And then the spirit of God comes down. So you are anointed. Praise the name of our Lord. You become anointed by the Holy Spirit. And now when you are anointed by the same Holy Spirit, praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to John chapter 14. John chapter 14 and then verse 12. He says, "Ververily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my father." Praise the name of our Lord. He says you do the same work. So when you have the Holy Spirit in your life, praise the name of our Lord, you can do what Jesus did. Praise the name of our Lord. You just need to have that faith. Exercise. You know the promises of God, they come to pass in our lives. Like maybe you are a mother at home. At night, your child is sick. Take the promise of God. Lay your hand upon that sick child. Praise the name of the Lord. Pray to God what you want to be to that child. Praise the name of our Lord. He says you can do the same works. You can pray. You can claim anything in the name of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, you need to see that you take the promises of God and let it come to pass. Praise the name of our Lord. Now, in the book of 1 John chapter 2, and then verse 27, the Bible says, "But the anointing which you have received of him abides in you. [Music] And you need not that any man should teach you, but as the same anointing teaches [Music] you of all things, and that is truth, and is no lie, and Even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him. Says we have received the anointing. What's the anointing? The Holy Spirit. So we have received the Holy Ghost from Christ. And then that Holy Ghost abides in us. Praise the name of our Lord. And then when the Holy Ghost is in us, he teaches us. He guides us in all truth. Praise the name of our Lord. Every Wednesday, we've been preaching about the Holy Ghost. Praise the name of our Lord. So for those who are unable to attend Wednesday services, you can always go back to our YouTube channel and then those are there quite a number of them on the Holy Ghost on the Holy Spirit and we still have about three or four more services on the Holy Spirit. What is the Holy Spirit? Just taking time that we take all this kind of doubts and unbelief about the Holy Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. God has given us the Holy Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. You don't need to say, "Oh, when are we going to organize a general meeting around?" You can receive the Holy Spirit at any time as long as you hear the word. Open your heart, obey, desire for God. When the spirit comes down, that's what the scripture says. Praise the name of our Lord. As many as received him, to them he gave the power to become the sons of God. How can you say 5 years without the Holy Ghost? What's wrong with you? 10 years without the Holy Ghost, your understanding has something wrong because he has given us the Holy Spirit. So we go forward and receive the Holy Ghost. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in John 14:26 the Bible says, "But the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Praise the name of our Lord. The comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name will teach you all things. Remind you all things. Praise the name of the Lord. Anointing is not emotion. Praise the name of the Lord. Now in the Old Testament they were using oil as anointing. Oh now Luganda mixes it or puts it together. They were using oil to anoint and you know Uganda is also funny when you know of petrol and paraffin but oil after Praise the name of the Lord. Like this anointing oil, olive oil, olive plant. Praise the name of they were using this kind of oil to anoint So they were anointing places of worship. They were anointing the priesthood. They were anointing oil to the kings and even prophets were anointed. But then Christ was the whole anointing as the high priest, as the great king, as the house of God, as the bread of life. Praise the name of our Lord. Christ was the whole anointing. Praise the name of our Lord. And even us now, we are anointed of the Holy Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. So God anoints us and the anointing he gives us is the Holy Spirit himself. Now in the message the world is falling apart again. says the church cannot run without the power of God through the word and the Holy Spirit will confirm will only confirm the word of God for that's what it is to do the anointing is to confirm the word don't look for anointing without the word praise the name You'll be falsely anointed. Okay, you are a false vessel, but having the Holy Spirit. So, you can do the works of the Holy Spirit and live the life of the devil. That's what means the anointed ones at the end time. They have no seed of God inside of them. So the Holy Ghost comes to their human spirit. They can prophesy. They can speak in tongues. They can do miracles. But they are going to hell. Praise the name of our Lord. Brother Brandham, when he went when he first went to the Pentecostal meetings, one person spoke in tongues and another person actually interpreted and then he took interest to find out what their life is and then he started you know going to speak to them so that he can catch their spirit and know what kind of life they have. So he went to the first one and he had a clean life, genuine. But then when he went to the other one, he was living with another woman, yet he's married and he had two children with that same woman. And then he asked God, is it really the Holy Spirit on this man? And then God showed him a vision how they they filled has the wheat and the tears. And then it was so dry and then they started crying. They started crying for rain. And now when it started raining, the wheat was rejoicing and even the tears were rejoicing. And then God made him go to Hebrews chapter 6. Praise the name of our Lord. We can take that scripture and read it. Hebrews chapter 6. And then verse seven, he says, "For the earth drinkketh in the rain that cometh upon it, and bringeth forth haps meat, for them by whom it is dressed, receiving the blessing from God. But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be banned. So you see the rain coming. It blesses the hs and even the thorns. They grow up but the other one is burnt. The thorns and so on. Praise the name of our Lord. So now in this message we have been reading the world is falling again apart. The anointing is to confirm the word and Jesus was the anointed one. The word made flesh. That's the reason he walked out into the water there. He was the word coming to the prophets. He was baptized by the prophets. And then the prophet raised up and said, "I must decrease, I shall increase." We find that God's way of doing it. Praise the name of our Lord. Christ the word. The spirit came upon him. Praise the name of our message paradox. He said Christ is coming to his body. Christ is the word. We all know the anointing is Christ that comes on the word that makes the word live. That is the anointing. Christ is the anointing. The spirit that comes upon the word and quickens the word to make it live. Now the word is in your heart. You believe in divine healing. Whatever more and Christ the anointing coming to his body. See the connection there. Just like the husband and wife to become one. Now the church has got to get to the ministry. Until the church and Christ become one, he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible. All of it is yours. Everything promised at this age is yours. Praise the name of our Lord. He says everything. We have been anointed. We've been blessed by the Holy Ghost so we can claim the promises of God. Praise the name of our Lord. So anointing is not emotion. The anointing praise the name of our Lord is the spirit of God coming down in us. And then the spirit of God will give us the ability will give us the power to live the life of Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. Whereby it's no longer I that live but Christ that lives in you. Praise the name of our Lord. On Wednesday, we are talking the earnest of the Holy Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. Meaning when he gives us the Holy Spirit, it shows there is more that is to come. He has given us a down payment. There is more that is coming. Praise the name of our Lord. And so the Holy Ghost in you will make you yearn for more of God in your life. The Holy Ghost in you will make you desire to know what's the will of God in this issue. How does the Lord want you to behave in this kind of issue? The Holy Ghost in you praise the name of he says I will not leave you comfortless. and then I will come unto you. Praise the name of our God. So you need to see that you yield your life to the spirit of God. And when the spirit of God is in you, you will be led of the spirit of God. Praise the name of you know an interesting scenario is here. God told Abraham, "Leave your country and got the land I'm going to show." And when Abraham reached the land of Canaan, praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says, even God showed him, I've given you this land. But then when he was in the land of Canaan, the Bible says, he lived in Cananan as a pilgrim and as a stranger. So cananan was like a down payment. Cananan was like the earnest of the eternal land that is coming. So when he was in Canaan, he looked for a city whose builder and maker is God. When we have the Holy Ghost, when you have the Holy Spirit in you, you will desire that kind of life. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says in this body we groan. But why are you groaning? Because the spirit of God is telling you there's a better land than this. There's a better condition than this. Praise the name of our Lord. That should be our desire. Oh, I want to see him. I want to see his face. Praise the name of our Lord. Like brother Brana when he was beyond the curtain of time said I want to see Jesus. Praise the name of Lord. When the battle is won we shall wear a crown. Praise the name of our Lord. If the Holy Spirit gives you such expectation in life even when you don't have money, even when you are fully disappointed in the Lord, but you see where you are going. Praise the name of Lord. Even if you are sick, You know this is just temporary. There's a better life ahead like Paul when Paul was was in bonds before the kings and governors. And then he started preaching to them. Praise the name of Lord. And then he preached them the gracious word of God. And then he told the king, "Oh king, and all you noble people are here, I wish you were like me. The libert I have in the Lord Jesus." And then he said, "Except the bonds that I'm in." Now to them, he looked at the bonds. But to Paul, he looked at something which is eternal. And then he told them, "I wish you were like me. Praise the name of our Lord. Be honest of the Holy Spirit. We've just got a down payment. But there is greater things to come. What the Bible says, the eye has not seen. Your ears have not what God has prepared for them. Praise the name of God. So when you receive the word of God, take it with all your heart and allow the word of God to transform you. But then you don't allow the devil to get you into evil things, to get you into evil thoughts, to get you into any kind of living which is not right. We have something better before us than what the world can give unto us. Praise the name of just desire more of God. Lord, I long for you. Lord, I need you. Not that you don't have him, but you want more of him. Praise the name of more of God. God, better life. Praise the name of our Lord. Where you are more obedient, where you have a better understanding, where you make better decisions. Praise the name of our Lord. That should always be our longing all the time. Lord, come down in my life. Lord, I need more of you. Lord, I need more fellowship. Lord, I need more communion. Praise the name of our Lord. Like we are going for the communion. Praise the name of Lord. Let it be a continual thing in our lives. At our home, as an individual, you have time with the Lord. Don't wait when you are together and say, "Let me wait for that time. Take time as an individual and have fellowship with God. Let the goodness of God come down in your life. The goodness of God come down in your life. If the Lord is in you, you be able to bless others. Praise the name of our Lord. May God bless you. Amen. Amen. Let us sing that song. Oh, I want to see him. song leads us into worship and then we can each of us pray and then we prepare for the Lord's supper. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us stand up and sing that song together just to rejoice before the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord.

I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. So we are starting our session the Lord's supper then we shall follow it by foot washing. Let us stand up and take the scripture 1 Corinthians chapter 11. We're reading from verse 23 up to verse 26. The Bible says, "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sapped saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. Do as you of drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show forth the Lord's death till he come. Whereforeever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. Praise the name of the Lord. So that's why we take some bit of time you know on meditation seeking the grace of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Before Christ or before God, none of us is worthy. But when we take on his blood, we have become worthy. Praise the name of our Lord. So that's why you know it say Lord have mercy upon him in this area. Lord have mercy. This kind of weakness you know just call upon his name. You know, just like that man who went to the temple, a publican, and the Bible says he would not cast his eyes to heaven. Lord have mercy upon me. The Pharisee who went in the temple, started saying, "I fast two times a week. I pay titles of all that I have. I do good works." Jesus said, "The publican went back when he's justified. while the public the the good for him. So that's the same thing we do also. Lord grace in my weaknesses. Lord help me in my failures. You know that's how you call upon the name of God. So let us pray. Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you for this opportunity that Lord, we've come before you, Lord. And as you were doing this, Lord, we're doing it by your commandment that as often as we can. We could we take the bread symbolizing your body and also we partake of the wine symbolizing your blood, the blood of the New Testament. whereby we are enjoined unto Christ by his blood. We pray that father you may forgive us of all unrighteousness. Give us of all unworthiness every one of us who is here. I believe there's nobody who has stayed up to this time who really doesn't want to do what your commandment does. Therefore pray may give grace to each and every one of us that the blood of Jesus Christ may wash from all unrighteous. Make us clean and make us worthy that you can be able to dine on your table. Father, even as we dine from your table, the physical elements, may we be blessed by this, Lord, and all that you've ordained, oh God, how we can be blessed, Lord. May we be blessed by obedience to your word. Be with us through this session, Lord. Lord we pray for the bread we are going to break bread that we meet the purpose Lord for the Lord is supper we thank you and bless your name in the name of Jesus Christ you us amen so you may sit down just being in a mode of meditation we receive the All right, for now we got [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Death [Music] for my soul.
