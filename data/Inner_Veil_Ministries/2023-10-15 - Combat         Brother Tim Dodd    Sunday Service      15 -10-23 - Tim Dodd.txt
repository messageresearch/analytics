monitoring of the national exams so sister Maria say she'll be working between 16th and 28th she request for your prayers amen amen so we are here in the presence of the Lord amen amen the first man I baptized when I came to the message is here brother Ben you can stand up God bless you brother benome Among Us amen amen so we have brother team with us and uh we want him to take the pit immediately and the rest of introductions of the ministers we shall do it uh after the service but everyone you are very welcome so we have brother team from kovel you know amen so he is visiting with us again he's not a stranger he is one of us I believe one half is Ugandan and one half is Canadian amen amen and I really like him because he knows how to get down to the word and I want you to just pay all your attention when the word is being preached amen amen when it touches you say amen and encourage him you see when we stand here to preach we keep wondering whether the people are hearing are they hearing or they are not uh because you know you really feel like you want talk to the soul of a man and once you talk and you know the soul receives amen I mean it it will honestly say Amen or it will lift a hand up or you'll have a beaming face you know the minister will know he's communicating with you amen so we certainly appreciate brother team sparing time to come and be with us and we want to have you here on the platform straight so that you can speak to the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ millions of worlds are here because every single soul is worth 100,000 world Amen so we've got millions you can multiply this world into millions to get the value that we have and yet again more valuable because this world doesn't have eternal life but we are talking about worlds of eternal life bless you as you feed on the word let us stand up amen amen bless amen I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ without that name we wouldn't know each other it's because of him that I am half Ugandan we love you and it's good to be back in Uganda and I want to thank brother Steven for the invitation we have worked very closely with brother Stephen and brother uh James in the work that is going on we thank God for every soul they as brother Steven said they are worth very much in God's sight and in our sight and I bring you greetings from our elder brother bisco and I bring you greetings from the pastor brother Tom Ray and all of the ministers and all of the Believers in Cloverdale send their greetings I I'm so glad to be here and I was just in Ethiopia I stopped in Ethiopia before I came here and the brothers in Ethiopia said send the Believers in Uganda our greetings so you have greetings from Ethiopia and every the Believers around the world have heard what God is doing in you guys to God be the glory amen Give the Lord a hand clap amen we thank God for everything that he's doing I'm a blessed man you are blessed people and I I want to say that I am blessed to have some of my family here today now my son Sten is in Uganda and he's preaching today in uh is it cero cero brother hington Bita but I brought to church my grandson this is my grandson Judah he is my oldest of 18 grandchildren and we're so glad to have him with us amen do you love the Lord amen amen and anybody that didn't say Amen is a visitor and we welcome you too and by the end of the service we trust that you also will love the Lord amen amen I forgot to ask what time is the afternoon service three after I finish three okay all right very good let's take our Bibles and turn to the Book of Revelation you know who I am so I don't need much introduction Revelation chapter 4 now I want to spend both Services dealing with the anointings around the Throne of God the anointing that he sends upon the church and this morning we're going to take and lay the found Nation so that this evening we can this afternoon we can speak specifically of your anointing so I trust you'll stay with me today as brother Steven said if the word strikes you then just say Amen or raise your hand or if you're Baptist nod your head praise the lord it's good to be here let's bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we come now to a very sacred time recognizing Lord that no man can give Revelation you alone are the revealer of the word but you have our by the foolishness of preaching that your word would go forth that it would save Souls that it would edify the church that it would bring us into a perfect stature that it would loose Divine love amongst the people Lord I pray you take the preeminence today as we read the word and speak of it Lord may you anoint the speaker anoint The Interpreter anoint the hearer may we all come into one mind and one Accord for we know if we can come into one mind then Lord you would move spontaneously healings would take place Deliverance would happen demons would be set to fight and so we ask your blessing this service is yours father blessed we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Revelation 4 and verse 6 and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like unto Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind [Music] and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third Beast had the face of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is amen the Lord add his Blessing to the word you may have your seats now as we read in the Book of Revelation we recognize that the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols that these four beasts they were representing something John saw them in a vision Ezekiel Saw them in a vision they were even reflected in the Old Testament now the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols but the Old Testament is shadows and types but you are the reality hallelujah hallelujah you are the reality that God has come to dwell in you are the house of God you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you are the one that he is his ultimate [Music] purpose is that God would come from Elohim the self-existing God and take the name Jehovah which means a God the god that dwells with his people for his family amen we are the family of God I think I heard you singing it this morning I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God how many are glad amen now we see that we are in great distress of times and the enemy is trying to destroy the world and he has rights in this world But ultimately what he wants to destroy is the predestinated of God for they are the word made manifest in this age that's you that's Israel amen God has a purpose and a place the for the ones that he forew and he wrote on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world in other words we were always on in his mind but now have become manifest in this age all right now I want to read some quotes from God's Prophet this morning I know you're a church that believes brother ROM was God's Vindicated prophet and you could put the slides up for me on the screen it will just help us to follow along a little bit amen now these are out of the fifth seal and if I have go back one if I have a title for the service this morning it's combat you are in a combat a battle you you are in a high intensity combat but it's not flesh and blood is spiritual powers that you are fighting against but you're not fighting by your own power you're fighting by the power of the holy spirit in the church all right let's put this first page up I'm not sure why the um uh transitions aren't working they should go step by step and uh just give me okay well we'll leave this up here and uh are you using space bar to transition I just want to get it good for you so you can follow along should go what are we in F5 click F5 F5 F5 function five all right and then space bar to get from one spot to the other no all right we'll leave we'll leave this here all right I'll follow along on this page all right then just what as we when I tell you just press the space bar okay all right here we go are you ready all right now brother Ram says in the fifth seal we find out in the church ages that those four beasts meaning four powers was gathered around the Acts of the Apostles just the way that the Tabernacle in the wilderness so the prophet of God is saying these four beasts is gathered around the Acts of the Apostles now I want you to remember the church is a continuation of the book of Acts so it's not just the Acts of the Apostles in the first age but it's the acts of the holy spirit in the church through every age amen now he goes on he says say they were watching over this the lamb and the word to perform the word just as they did the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy place in the wilderness amen and so forth next he says notice the even the nature of the Beast was exactly a tribal [Music] emblem now in order to show you this I have a little diagram for you to show you what brother brandham was talking about this is the ark the Tabernacle in the wilderness now notice that it has three courts it has the outer Court the holy place and the holy of holies in the outer Court the whole of the congregation could enter the holy place was where the priesthood would Minister and the table of showbread was in there and the candlesticks were in there and the altar of incense was in there but then there was a third place that was the holy of holies and God dwelt in the holy of H and the high priest entered in there once a year with blood to make intercession for the people it was a representation and that representation is is you you have three courts your body your spirit your soul see it shows that in the flesh the world has access to the flesh you live in this world you contact This World by this body see taste feel smell and hear that's that's the outer Court by which we contact the world Amen now and the next court no no no sorry go back page up no I'll tell you when just give me the whole court again next one he's up here we go we'll stay here for a while all right now in this court in the second Court we have the we have where the priesthood goes represents your spirit listen now the the priesthood is the ministry see the ministry deals with the battle that's going on in your mind that's showing us the purpose of the ministry to preach word because the ministry in general does not go into the holy of holies the holy of holies is God's domain alone your soul is God's domain alone when God comes into your soul you are sealed until the day of your Redemption amen the devil can't get in there no man can get in there but there's a high priest the one high priest the Lord Jesus Christ with his own blood who sanctifieth forever those that believe he enters into the soul realm and your nature is changed from unbelief to Faith amen from sin to perfect love and he is our high priest listen now Paul says in the book of Hebrews and he goes through the first seven chapters establishing the deity of Jesus Christ and then chapter 8 and verse one he says the sum of these things is we have a high priest amen now brother brandham preached on the first seven chapters of Hebrews but if you take chapter 8 to chapter 10 you'll find that Jesus is the high priest all right and the ministration of the high priest listen closely now he is the high priest of our confession if you are a temple of the Living God he is a high priest of the Temple of the Living God he is not everyone's high priest he is a high priest of the temple which was represented in in the wilderness so he is your high priest when by faith you have received the blood one sacrifice all sin past present and future you are sealed to the day of your Redemption and the high priest makes intercession for you ministering for you hallelujah hallelujah because you are a temple of the Living God all right so this is what God's protection is for for his Dwelling Place he is the word John 1 and one in the beginning was the word John 1:14 and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus was the Temple of the fullness of God but he went to Calvary to loose the feminine part of his Spirit to come back to the church in Acts chapter 2 so we could also say about you the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us you you are the Temple of the Living God and God is protecting his Dwelling [Music] Place amen now you can give me amen amen Next Step all right there we are let's just shrink it down because I want to show you the layout here around the Tabernacle in the wilderness all right now let me take a step back here now Moses saw the pattern in heaven he saw what John saw you saw what Ezekiel Saw and he was told to take the pattern set it up on earth now Israel coming out of Egypt were not anything but a what would be the right word for it an a disorganized mass of people all they knew was the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that was their claim to God but now God is going to reveal himself of his final manifestation in a shadow here amongst Israel in the wilderness now listen when Moses comes down from the mountain he doesn't come into the midst of the people say okay we need to get all organized here you go here and you go there and so give us some space here to set up the Tabernacle that wasn't how it happened the Bible says Moses set up the Tabernacle a far off but he brought the he built the Tabernacle outside the camp and then he began to place the people around the word you see the word places the people now the first placing was the placing of the ministry they at the door to the Tabernacle we find Moses and Aaron dwelling there the messenger of the age and his representative and then all around the Tabernacle was was camped the ministry the Levites because it's always the Levites that carry the burden of the word and the word is a burden the word is a Ministry the word is something that must be dealt with it's not just here it is and believe whatever you want no the word is a revelation of God himself and God wants to dwell amongst his people but he doesn't dwell amongst his people the way you want him he dwells in his Heavenly order he has a Heavenly order and it takes the eyes of a prophet to reveal the Heavenly order that that Heavenly order would come into our lives and declare the glory of God because it's not the glory of man it's not the Glory of a church it's not a glory of a priesthood it's the glory of God himself he's declaring himself hallelujah hallelujah he's declaring himself bride amen now we lost our screen here there we are oh there it is now after he set the priesthood in order oh my we could really go through Ephesians 4 now he sent gifts unto men Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ what's edifying building up not tearing down building up amen for the until they all come into the measure of the fullness of the stature of Christ all right so first God establishes five-fold Ministry for the work of the ministry to bring the body into the stature of Jesus Christ amen amen so then Moses put the rest of the congregation in order [Music] and around the priesthood was camped the 12 tribes this was according to the order that Moses saw in heaven because the tribes had certain symbols they were emblems all right give me the next one and the emblems of these tribes was the lion the ox the man and the eagle the lion the ox the man and the eagle why this is what Moses saw in heaven a lion AR a man and E so he says dan you go here Ephraim you go here Judah you go here Reuben you go here because it's a representation of what he saw in heaven are you with me now there's a purpose of this because these are protecting the word in their day because the enemy May attack the camp but what at the the center of the camp it's the Tabernacle and what's the Tabernacle it's [Music] you the purpose of the anointings is to protect you because you are God's Dwelling Place amen amen amen the enemy we've got some symbols here in the first four seals there's four horse horses one Rider Changing Horses The White Horse the red horse the Black Horse and the pale and when the right horse comes in the standard of the Lord is the lion anointing and when the red horse comes in he's against a different standard that's the ox anointing when the when the Black Horse comes in he's against the man anointing and when the Pale Horse the combination of all the powers of the horse and the Antichrist Spirit riding on the horse the greatest enemy the Bible says says hell follows after him the greatest anointing God sends in the church is the eagle anointing the greatest anointing to combat the greatest enemy these are also represented in the gospels Matthew Mark Luke and [Music] John their character fits these anointings all right next one brother brandom says now we see that the devil changing four Beast meant that what power he revealed to the world and how they ended on this pale death now let's look at God's powers of these beasts to combat them and that's where I take my title combat he says when the Antichrist was right in with his false teaching God sent his teaching out the word the lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word made manifest in the Holy Spirit notice that statement the lion it's an anointing an anointing what is an anointing it's a word made manifest in the Holy Spirit we think the anointing is emotions we think the ano anointing is Sensations but that's not what an anointing is in Luke chapter 4 Jesus Takes the scroll and reads the scroll the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the gospel to loose the captives to mend the broken hearts to bring Deliverance to the captives and he finished the reading of the script and what did he do he sat down brother brandham says it this way we would think with the greatest anointing that was ever Upon A man that that man would run all over the room and dance and Shout that man under that anointing would run all over the room run around and dance and Shout because that's what we think anointing is but brother Brown says anointing is not [Music] emotions anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how in other words words in an anointing comes Revelation and Revelation shows you exactly how to act and Jesus under the greatest anointing sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth hallelujah hallelujah all right so he says this anointing the lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word made manifest in the Holy Spirit and a holy spirit there to manifest himself which is the word double emphasis here brother I'm showing you can't disconnect the word from the Holy Spirit [Music] because the holy spirit is the word amen give me the next part that's the reason the early church had healings and miracles and vision and power is because it was the Living Word in the form of the Lion the lion of the tribe of Judah riding out to combat that says amen now you got it said he sends his power Antichrist and God sends his the word wait a minute wait a minute God sends his what his power what is his power the word amen amen all right no I think we missed something here go back all right we'll stop there for a moment just you can just turn the screen off thank you I'll come back to it now in Acts chapter 1 and verse 8 are you still with me all right in Acts chapter 1 and verse 8 it says but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem Judea and Samaria and unto the other most parts of the Earth all right so these these four anointings Around The Throne are the power that God sends in the church all right the new birth God himself taking up residence he says and and to that new birth you shall receive power now the Pentecostals they just think it's just power when you holy got the Holy Ghost you got power no the power is the anointing that is sent to protect the [Music] word because the word has taken up residence in your soul and the enemy is going to attack that word but when the enemy comes in like the flag the spirit of the Lord raises up a standard and the standard in the first stage was the lion [Music] anointing the power of those anointings is identified by their by their standard amen God sends powers to combat the enemy now listen where's the greatest battle it's in your mind the enemy comes into your mind so then God sends his power to combat that oh wait till you see it tonight I I want to go right there now but let's just stay with the foundation let's just nail it down you going to help me we're going to nail this down so we know exactly where we're standing in this okay because the power is to combat the enemy in your mind it's not power to change who you are it's power to show show you who you [Music] are amen it's a Warfare and Corinthians Paul says in Corinthians though we walk in the flesh it's 2 Corinthians 10 and three though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds where are these strongholds are they in the government are they in the Vatican are they in hell no they're in your mind says casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity remember these anointings are the power to do this bringing into captivity bringing into captivity every thought where's the battle in your thoughts bringing into captivity every thought because our minds are weak but God sends you an anointing to combat the evil thoughts that the devil puts in your mind somebody asked brother brandom said how can I tell the difference between my thoughts and the devil's thoughts and brother Bram says if it agrees if it disagrees with the word of God Devil's thoughts if it agrees with the word of God it's God's thoughts hallelujah hallelujah your mind is where the battle is your mind is where the battle is the battle is in your mind hallelujah hallelujah but God sends an anointing against what the Antichrist is trying to do in your mind bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ the word hallelujah hallelujah let's use an example you might be sick this morning and the devil's saying you you're going to be sick a long time the devil's saying you're a bad person the devil's saying you deserve to be sick the devil's telling you you can't be healed he might even he might even use a doctor to tell you there's no hope for you but that thought is brought into captivity to The Obedience of the word of God for by his stripes you are healed Hallelujah now there's no there's no difference in the sacrifice oh if you could catch this you'll catch it tonight but if you could catch this now there's no difference to the atonement there's no difference to the reality of the promise the promise doesn't change the word doesn't change what needs to change is your thoughts to line up with the word of God as brother Bram said it the right attitude towards any Divine promise will bring it to [Music] pass hallelujah hallelujah so when the Antichrist was writing with his false teaching God sent out his te shout out the word the devil sends his power God sends his power the word amen and there in the book of Acts chapter 2 when God sent the Holy Ghost and they were born again and as Jesus said and then they received power those that were cowards became lions amen they moved out under the power of the Holy Spirit and said these men are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which was spoken by the prophet I pour out my spirit in the last days your sons and your daughters will prophesy their young men shall see Visions their old men will dream dreams this day this scripture [Applause] isah what was it the word manifest the anointing of the hour identified the word manifest hallelujah hallelujah they they went out from there and conquered that age under that Fearless lion anointing all right now that was the first seal the white horse rider in combat against the lion [Music] anointing but then came the Dark Ages the second seal and the devil the Antichrist changed his horse changed his power changed his false anointing as he stepped onto the red horse and the Bible says that power was given to him to take peace from the Earth all right now what happened why don't you put the slideshow back up for me slide number five I think it is all right all right no stop at the first paragraph there we go now the second beast that the Antichrist sent out was a red horse Red Beast that he rode on to take peace from the earth and War now the second one that went out to combat him was the ox Beast [Music] amen it means a labor a beast of [Music] burden all right let's look at what happened the enemy now went out to destroy to kill in the natural and 68 million Martyrs gave their lives all right now these these Martyrs what what happened here they were not Anointed with the lion anointing anymore they were not the Bold Fearless group did they become cowards did the Lions become cowards no the anointing changed they who went throughout the world fearlessly protected under that anointing now in this age they freely gave their lives for the testimony of the word of God they freely were burned at the stake fed to wild animals they were saw aunder all manner of death they were anointed to do that the seed must fall into the ground and die there was a purpose that God has as the as the bridegroom seed fell into the ground now the bride seed falls into the ground but it will come out again under Luther Wesley and Pentecost all right so they were they were Martyrs give me the next that shows that the th tyan age after the Antichrist got settled down [Music] and they come into the thra age the little church could do nothing but just simply labor and another thing the ox is also a beast of sacrifice see they give their lives just as freely as they could give them all right next one goes on here the martyrs down Through the Ages there suffered terribly I'm sorry I cannot change the word martyrs you'll get it the martyrs suffered but the martyrs suffered but what were they listen now they were under the inspiration the spirit of God the power now here here's a key and he says don't forget this church and you Brethren on tape I want you to examine this who's he talking to you you get all right he says how could man do anything else besides the power of God that had been relased to [Music] them see when you look at it through the human mind you think what's wrong with these people didn't they have the Holy Ghost they're not acting like they did in the first age now they're all being murdered they're giving their lives is there something wrong with them no it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost through every age the new birth is the same the difference is the anointing the difference is the power that is sent into the church so brother random says how could man do anything else besides the power of God that's released to [Music] them amen amen he say he says now I'm going to put a box up here to represent that I put it on the slide but it's not relevant to what we're saying the next sentence is what I want to get to no no stay there go back all right he says here if God sends a certain Spirit among them that's the only thing they can work by this is a principle here when God sends his power into the church a specific anointing that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that works among them amen amen all right next one now now will prove you to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose and watch exactly the church responded to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else amen let's go let's keep going and they didn't care because the spirit of the church in that day was sacrificed listen you don't understand what they went through because you're under a different anointing but they were anointed to do that it says they brother said they walked up just as freely as they could walk they were Anointed with the true spirit of God for that age and they died like Heroes of sacrifice thousands times thousands 68 million of them on the record o sacrifice amen all right you can take it down now turn it off thank you we'll go we'll go to the next slide in a moment because I want you to notice now that something changes actually I'm sorry put it back up we we'll read the next portion all right hallelujah it's the last one the next thing that went out to combat that was a beast with the face of a man smart educated now what does that tell us the anointing was to education under this an anointing I'll just I'll just drop this in that's why in the last anointing the eagle God used a prophet with only a seventh grade education because under the eagle the anointing is no longer to education all right so now we see he says a man anointing smart educated shrew fine Anointed with the spirit of that day amen all right next notice idolatry brought the man Beast went forth with the power of God by the wisdom of God wisdom that God gave him and brought the church from idolatry back to God all right now you can put it down all right now let's look at that age okay who was Martin Luther he was a highly educated Catholic monk who was John Wesley he was a highly educated Anglican priest they were moving under the anointing of a man now now let's go back to Martin Luther just to show you the transition or the change from the ox anointing to the man anointing as Martin Luther was as Martin Luther was studying the word of God in particular The Book of Romans God began to anoint his word in a fresh way and the Holy Spirit began to deal with Martin Luther who had been taught that it was by works you attain salvation but he could never attain peace in that why not there was a seed Gene in there and it was had a deep calling and there had to be a deep to respond to that call and so he went where to the word of God and he began to see the word and the just shall live by faith hallelujah hallelujah till Martin SL slogan became the word alone the word alone faith alone grace alone no Works involved why because God was opening something up here now Luther was not the first one to see this matter of fact as he studied the teachings of a man by John hus John hus was born or ministered a hundred years before Luther and John hus taught the same thing that Luther taught why didn't John hus cause the Reformation he was under an O anointing and John hus was burned at the stake for what he taught he was burned he was you just say he was burned yeah yeah he was tied to a post and burned but you know many of the martyrs said you don't have to tie me I'll just stand here why they were anointed anointed to give their lives all right listen now on as he was dying John hus cried out all right now hope you remember the words John hus means Goose all right and he said you can cook this Goose but there's coming a swan that you won't be able to cook hallelujah hallelujah he was prophesying and 100 years later the family called Luther had on their emblem a swan and and Martin Luther moved under the inspiration of the word and began to preach the just shall live by faith and he and he was called to the council by the Roman Catholic church and at the council it was ruled Martin Luther is a heretic he is in error his teaching is false teaching and the emperor of the Roman Empire said from this day anybody that finds Martin Luther sees Martin Luther will kill Martin Luther Martin Luther was sentenced to death but he never died why the anointing had [Music] changed John hus was under an ox's anointing but Martin Luther was under a man anointing because the time had moved forward I will restore sayth the Lord all that the Palmer worm the canker worm the caterpillar the Locust have eaten I will restore it was the beginning of the restoration hallelujah hallelujah the Roman Church couldn't touch him because God has sent an anointing into the church to bring the word back to Revelation hallelujah hallelujah God was restoring hallelujah hallelujah and and Martin Luther teaching justification brought the church out of idolatry but that wasn't all the the restoration God was restoring the life of the believer bringing the church out of form being [Music] formal that and Mar and John Wesley began to preach a Sanctified life that you are Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ a consecrated life what was God doing it was a move of God it was a move of God under Luther it was a move of God under Wesley it was a move of God under Pentecost it was God bringing the church out of death and bringing them to the fullness of the life hallelujah hallelujah it wasn't an event it was a journey hallelujah hallelujah he said brother now this isn't on a slide so now I'm just going to quote you Hallelujah take a drink have some water all right here's brother brandham now he says when the wlans come along with their [Music] Revival they said we don't need you luin anymore but did you know the very life that was in the blade made the [Music] tossle all right so now brother R was talking about the wheat plant the seed goes the sea goes into the ground and dies and the first thing to come out is a little a little shoot a blade of grass now remember Matthew 25 are you with me is this too much for you all right we keep going so the shoot come out of the ground now in Matthew 25 the parable of the weed in the tears it says that the weed and the tears came up together in the original shoot that comes out of the ground it's like a blade of grass you can't tell them apart and the and the angel said should we separate them oh we can spend a lot of time on Luther's day right now and the fanaticism that causes the Revival that enters the Revival the Angels were said don't separate them don't separate the fanaticism from the Revival don't separate the false from the true but in the Harvest Time in the last days there will be sent an anointing that will cause a separation but under Luther's day they grow side by side all right then the plant grows into the tossel and it's the life that was in the blade that goes into the tossel and that tossel represented Wesley now let's go back to what brother brand was talking about he said the very life that was in the blade made the [Music] toss it can't go no further until it uses the blade he said it's a PO it's a pollen and shakes off of itself into the blade and then comes out and then comes out the ear or you might call it the head of the grain he said he says that was the Pentecostal the restoration of the gifts coming back into the church now the ear can't look back and say tossel I have no need of you or of the [Music] blade because it takes the blade and the tossle to make the ear all right so brother ROM's describing something to us here he's saying now he's not talking about farming he's talking about the church he says Luther was the first life to come out of the sea it was life but then Wesley come along and says you don't have life we don't need you now listen if Luther didn't have life then Wesley doesn't have life because the life that was in Luther moved into a different form in Wesley and then Along come the Pentecostals and the life that was in the Pentecostals was first in Wesley it's moving into a different form and the Pentecostals could not say we have no need of justification and no need of [Music] sanctification it's the same life in a further form hallelujah hallelujah all right so brother Ram says we can see these things [Music] now that the ear is ripe he says and it ends at the end time at the time of the end and he says I know we got a lot of fungus on this ear but it's still an ear just the same we got a lot of ins and outs little ISS in and out he says but God will shave that all off one of these days now listen watch what he says here and he will have a perfect ear of corn one of the these days he says Luther Wesley Pentecost were not perfect but it's the same Holy Spirit but then at the end time hallelujah hallelujah God is going to bring it to its Perfection Hallelujah Hallelujah can I keep going maybe we should close nobody's here anymore everybody's quiet should we go or stop go most of are for go the Baptist say stop praise the Lord if you're a Baptist don't be offended we're all coming into the fullness of the word all right my my my okay all right now in the opening of the seals brother bam describes these four living creatures these four powers they have a purpose as we've already described but brother Ram spent time showing us what the lion anointing did he showed us what the ox anointing did he showed us what the man anointing did but he never showed us what the eagle anointing did because the opening of the seals was the change between the man anointing and the eagle anointing the eagle anointing was not history the eagle anointing was future from the time of the opening of the seals until this time the church has been under the eagle anointing I want to go into that tonight but but I want you to see something here if you don't see a change of anointings you'll miss a lot that's in the message you have to understand that brother Brandon preached under a man anointing though he was a prophet the church was under a man anointing until the time of the opening of the SE SE and then in the opening of the seals the church comes under an eagle anointing and if you don't understand what that's for if you don't understand the corner that's been turn you'll think you're still living under a man anointing in the second age the second anointing the AR anointing they couldn't look back to the lion anointing and say why aren't we more like they were [Music] then why don't we have the same power they had in the day of Pentecost they had the Holy Ghost but the power was changed amen they couldn't ex they couldn't do anything but respond to the power that was given to them they couldn't live anywhere anyway else they could look back they could look backwards and say oh we need to try and be more like that but they would never be able to be like that unless it was intellectual intellectual they they could look at the history but by the spirit of God they were under an ox anointing hallelujah hallelujah they looked into the word of God the same word that Peter John that Paul preached they looked at the same word by a different anointing and it manifested the way it did in their lives because of the anointing they're under amen now Luther Wesley and the Pentecostal they couldn't look back to the arc age and say we should be sacrificing Our Lives we must not be real Believers we must not have the Holy Ghost nobody's killing us cuz they look to the previous age and that's what happened under a previous anointing now it's not saying that nobody died for the gospel people still will die for the gospel but that's not the anointing that's not what the church was called to they were called to take this word by the anointing of their age bring the church out of idolatry into the absoluteness of the word of God hallelujah hallelujah they couldn't say Oh we must not have the Holy Ghost cuz we're not acting like they acted in the in the Dark Ages no they had the Holy Ghost they had the Holy Ghost but it was a an anointing now what came under the man anointing what manifested under the man anointing all kinds of isms all kinds of uh outward manifestations not just justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost restoration of the gifts it was more than that see under the man anointing is where altar calls come from did you know that doesn't come from the book of Acts all kinds of evidences came out of the man anointing evidences Wesley's time they had the Shakers people would get under the Holy Ghost and they would Shake people would get under the Holy Ghost and they would shout under the Holy Ghost they would pass out and they throw water on them speak in tongues under the Pentecostals till they would say if you don't speak in tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost kinds of outward manifestations but that was the man anointing I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings but we are not restored to the man anointing we are restored to the original hallelujah hallelujah the gifts of the Spirit are in the church Church sanctification is in the church justification is in the church it's all been restored in the church amen but we've moved into a different anointing we're living in a different hour we now we can't look back at the man anointing and say oh how come I don't shake like they shook under the man anointing [Music] I must not have the Holy Ghost how come I don't dance like they did Under The Man anointing I believe in dancing I believe the Holy Spirit can strike a man and he can dance but it's no evidence of anything amen I believe that a man can dance in the spirit and I believe a man can dance in the [Music] flesh it's just dancing it's just dancing I don't want to hurt your feelings but I'm going to tell you straight there is no dancing mentioned in the bible after the book of Acts you want to dance dance I love to see people get so inspired with God that they just love to dance praise the Lord but if someone doesn't dance it doesn't mean they don't have the Holy [Music] [Applause] Spirit hallelujah hallelujah see the new birth that came in Acts chapter 2 is a divine revelation of who Jesus Christ is it revealed him for who he [Music] was the whole church is built upon that Jesus said to Peter as he said to the said to all the disciples who do men say that I am some say you're this and some say you're that and he said but who do you say the Peter says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas flesh and blood is not revealed this to you you didn't go to Bible school to learn this but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and Upon This Rock I'll build my church every age is built upon that the divine revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen now when Jesus was put in his body was put into the tomb Jesus wasn't there Jesus went to preach the souls and prison is that right and then he went out he left our sins there he gave our sins back to the devil where they came from not just past sin every sin hallelujah hallelujah it's like Jesus saying to the devil here you forgot something on the Earth I think it's yours your sins your sins your sins your sins hallelujah hallelujah they're not yours they belong to the devil and Jesus took them back there hallelujah hallelujah you stand spotless in the sight of God you stand spotless in amen but that's not the only place he went he ascended up on high and he went to empty out paradise and as the cry went out open up ye Everlasting Gates and be ye lifted up Let the king of glory come in and there he enters into Paradise where they are waiting for the provided sacrifice as he steps in there there he stands and and Abraham looks at him there he is MC hallelujah hallelujah Ezekiel says there he is the wheel in the wheel Daniel says there he is the Ancient of Days I seen him Moses said there he is the one I saw his H hearts on the mountain that's him now one says he's this one says he's that why were they different because it was the divine revelation of Jesus Christ in their [Applause] [Music] day hallelujah hallelujah Abraham couldn't look at Moses and say you don't even understand Moses couldn't look at Ezekiel and say what are you talking it was Christ revealing himself in that age it's the divine revelation of Jesus Christ one might say the other one didn't have the right Revelation but the Revelation is tied to the age that you're living in hallelujah hallelujah there is a revelation for this age because you are called under an eagle anointing and the eagle anointing comes to the world to give you the divine revelation of Jesus Christ for this hour it's not Luther's hour it's not Wesley's hour it's not Pentecostal it's the bride time [Applause] now brother brandham says in things that are to be he says you see the whole program the whole church is built upon divine revelation Jesus said in Matthew 16 flesh and blood is not revealed this to you but my Father in Heaven is revealed this to you what was it a revelation of who he was and the great church that he established on the day of Pentecost sorry let me go back he says the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was now [Music] hallelujah hallelujah the Bible expresses its growing in the bride to the full statue if the corn of wheat fall into the and the corn of wheat of Christ had to fall into the ground so did the bride have to fall into the ground through the Dark Ages see why are you reading this brother Tim so that you can understand I'm telling you what the prophet [Music] said we want to know what the prophet said about it he any any grain that goes in the ground must die or it cannot reproduce [Music] itself the great church that he established on the day of Pentecost by the sending of the Holy Ghost had to suffer murom he had to suffer martyrdom had to suffer martyrdom had to be [Music] martyrs and go into the dirt into the Earth in the dark [Music] to bring forth in the age of Luther and come all out to the full [Music] stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ in this last day hallelujah hallelujah rising of the sun he says that's Divine the divine revelation of the word made flesh it was made flesh in that day by the Sun the groom it's of Flesh today by the bride John 1 and verse one one and verse one of John in the beginning was the word verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us and I'll say this in the beginning was the word and now the word is being made flesh to dwell amongst us again hallelujah hallelujah we're coming to a close here brother brandom says in 1954 way back in 1954 he says what I'm trying to tell you what I'm trying to do is get to the Pentecostal people to let them realize who they are if you only knew who you was tonight there'd come such a spontaneous world of Faith through here till there wouldn't be a sick person listen what he's saying this is in the beginning of the ministry what I'm trying to do is to get you to see who you are now if he's trying to do that for the Pentecostals what's the problem they don't see who they are because if they saw who they were he said there'd be such a spontaneous move of faith that every sick person would be now I want to say that was under the man anointing but do you realize that the purpose of the eagle anointing is to show you who you are he goes on in 1954 and he said there'd be no need of having a prayer line if the people who's here realize who they are that's the only way you can do it how do you think it is in the foreign Nations walking against demons and powers and everything you have to know where you're standing Satan don't care how loud you holler Satan don't care how much you jump up and down Satan will lay right there but he has to recognize Faith how does faith come faith comes by hearing the word he has to recognize Faith it'll move him every time and that's where it is today the church has got the blessing but they don't know it let's let us pray Heavenly Father we stop there for this morning Lord I pray that you'll just take the foundational service this morning may we may we digest it into our hearts Lord come again in the next service if you would T and bring us into the fullness of what you have brought in this hour we commit this service to you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen the Lord hand of [Applause] praise he has brought the four living creatures all the way from the church in the wilderness amen and he has placed them exactly where they belong in Revelation chapter 4 brother Branham says they were now settled around the throne because the church was at home but it in Ezekiel chapter 1 you know they were moving with ar of the Covenant the anointing of the Holy Spirit goes with the word everywhere in every age are you together with me so we see that all those four living creatures with just different anointings that was necessary to operate at a certain time and so we saw that in the first three Church Ages which represented the uh first seal the word you know had to come forth as the lion of the tribe of Judah the anointing that they wanted they needed against the Antichrist and when the enemy held a SW in the Church of the the Holy Spirit poured down the anointing of anox it's the same Holy Spirit in the first one there it was holding the word from in the next one here God by the same Hol but a different anointing allowed them to give themselves over amen as sacrifice for the sake of the word then he has also told us after that came the man anointed which was the age of the Reformation we're running from sadis Philadelphia and leod amen there was a man anointing there intelligence of a man amen but then after that after the opening of the seals we are entering now into the bridge and now that's where God pourers the eego anointing amen he has told us the lion season or the lion seal amen that children of God were you know uh giving themselves out they were sewing seed in the next one the seed had to die in the ground under the O anointing under the man anointing the plant is standing again but under the ego anointing we are back to the seed again amen we need to keep under our seed anointing of the edge amen it takes us back into the full restoration of the world Alpha and Omega the thing coming together and when we are under that anointing of the our day there's no argument those things Sease in Maya the brother spoke about uh I will not say that because you are going to say it in the evening praise the Lord so under the anointing of our day if our faith is restored back under the origin I mean under the anointing of our age then it can only bring us back to the original seat the ideas of man which started in the man age we should not put a lot of concern over them you see there was the organization of the Quakers the Quakers okay qu quer quers qu qu you see this was an organization they come together and they believe that when the Holy Ghost comes you begin to quck and now this is the problem when people come into the message they come with elements of their old religions and now we start seeing people in the m the origin is the quers and they say you are not slain in the Holy Spirit it was not in the book of Acts and that's where we are being restored back we are not being restored the Pentecost as an organization where they had elements of quers dancing in the spirit it was not there those elements they come now in the age of man the evidence of the holy spirit is the word being made manifest in the life of a man whether you've danced or you not danced whether you are quing or you are not quing I don't know who told the people that when the Holy Ghost comes he [Music] speaks you just sett with the faith of the word that's enough for you that's very establishing brother team you know when we come back to the real word it plugs out those things and we must come back to the original condition to the original seat which was sown on the of P that's what God is coming back for Amen brother Moses where are you amen for living creatures praise God amen amen let me tell you the holy spirit in every age you know had to manifest in certain way depending on the need of that time and let me tell you also that in our local churches when the Holy Spirit Works he also works depending to the needs of that local church am God bless you do you appreciate our brother amen am you see when the Holy Spirit comes in the season and you receive him as he is in the season amen it puts our minds together all these arguments
