[37:41] Praise that in this vessel of
[37:46] clay you have something that the world
[37:50] can never pay
[37:54] for let's stand up and get to Matthew
[37:58] Chapter
[38:01] 13 and verse
[38:04] 44 what can you
[38:09] give praise the
[38:12] Lord so you are all
[38:16] welcome and the visitors Among
[38:19] Us brother Henry
[38:23] visitor tell us the truth
[38:28] praise the Lord amen so you are all
[38:33] welcome and just keep trusting that the
[38:37] Lord has something for everyone this
[38:42] morning verse 44
[38:46] says again the Kingdom of Heaven is like
[38:50] to treas he in a
[38:54] field the which when a man has found he
[38:59] hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and
[39:04] sell all that he has and buth the
[39:22] field I want you to view yourself as a
[39:25] ground
[39:32] where some
[39:35] precious uh gem can be
[39:41] hidden and as I've already
[39:44] said behind this Ann
[39:48] vessel they lay something so
[39:53] precious that the
[39:55] world can never
[39:58] for so by throwing away everything
[40:04] else you can be able to
[40:08] buy into
[40:10] control of the
[40:12] ground where the treasure
[40:15] is amen so by the
[40:21] field he gets a hold of the
[40:25] treasure that his
[40:28] Joy may be
[40:30] full verse
[40:33] 45 again the Kingdom of Heaven is like
[40:37] unto a merchant man seeking goodly Pals
[40:42] who when he had found one pile of great
[40:49] price or Great
[40:53] Value went and sold all that he had and
[40:57] bought
[41:13] precious Heavenly
[41:16] Father tonight to this
[41:19] morning we just feel like we are
[41:25] Prospectors men who go into the
[41:31] wild to look for something so
[41:35] precious that father when we find
[41:38] it we can sell
[41:42] everything and be able to possess
[41:45] it but today we've got
[41:49] Revelation that we don't have to go into
[41:52] all the
[41:54] wild we have to come into ourselves
[41:59] father that we may be able to
[42:01] discover the power of great
[42:04] price I pray that you may bless these
[42:08] people as they listen to your
[42:11] word and as they take by
[42:15] faith every promise that's coming to
[42:18] them this
[42:19] morning in Jesus name amen you may be
[42:25] seated so this
[42:28] morning I've got a
[42:32] title the ultimate
[42:37] value the ultimate
[42:41] value so we want to speak about
[42:46] value and
[42:50] Men Who find something very
[42:55] valuable they make
[42:58] sure that they get a very safe
[43:04] place and keep it
[43:06] there you don't keep your ultimate
[43:13] valuables you keep them in the living
[43:18] room but you take them in a remote spot
[43:22] in your
[43:24] house and sometimes most
[43:28] times you even buy a safe
[43:32] box where you are going to put those
[43:36] valuable
[43:38] things you don't just expose to every
[43:43] onlooker because it's very
[43:47] valuable so
[43:50] value means the weight invested in a
[43:53] matter
[43:57] different
[43:59] considerations could be monetary
[44:03] considerations or
[44:05] otherwise amen so in general
[44:09] terms it's the regard of
[44:13] consideration considered in
[44:17] Goods or Gos in
[44:21] life I would have gotten brother again
[44:24] to come here
[44:27] and to explain to us what legal value
[44:30] would
[44:33] me but I've not prepared it for
[44:37] him amen so when thinking about
[44:42] value your mind will always move in the
[44:50] importance attached to that particular
[44:53] valuable
[44:55] thing you always look at
[44:59] it in terms of commercial
[45:02] [Music]
[45:04] rating which is involved in that
[45:06] particular
[45:08] good and the message brother Bram
[45:11] preached
[45:14] investment is I mean is built around
[45:20] value and value invested in different
[45:23] categories
[45:27] could have
[45:28] value computed in different choices of
[45:33] life you know to many people you know
[45:38] value would mean
[45:40] anything to somebody to to be the
[45:45] education attaches very great value to
[45:49] that another person the fame
[45:53] we is the value can speak about
[45:58] to some other people value is their
[46:02] profession some is their good
[46:05] jobs and this may sound a little strange
[46:09] to
[46:10] you but to some
[46:13] people which is not your
[46:16] category it could be profitable habits
[46:28] like a
[46:29] Pros to somebody that's a
[46:32] value to some people it's
[46:35] gambling amen but you know uh
[46:40] when the scripture
[46:43] says it could be that you've invested in
[46:47] some of those
[46:49] areas but when you find something of
[46:53] Greater price
[46:57] you sell all
[46:59] that which you consider
[47:02] value in order for you to get a pile of
[47:07] great
[47:09] price are you together with me in the
[47:12] message
[47:13] invest brother Bram
[47:16] says if you are a
[47:18] [Music]
[47:19] businessman every P you
[47:22] got and buy the one of great price
[47:28] and then brother Bram
[47:30] says make your
[47:33] investment in
[47:37] Christ are you together with me he say
[47:40] sell
[47:41] everything and put your investment in
[47:45] Christ so at one point of
[47:48] life amen we
[47:51] shall all we have been faced with the
[47:55] challenge of value
[47:58] there was a rich ruler in the
[48:02] scripture at one point he was faced with
[48:07] the challenge of
[48:09] value all of us somewhere in life we
[48:14] shall be
[48:16] challenged with something that we call
[48:21] Value there will always be two
[48:23] Alternatives stand before you
[48:27] but where do you attach your
[48:29] value amen so in Mark
[48:34] 10 and verse
[48:36] 17 this
[48:38] Rich
[48:40] Young
[48:43] Ruler and you know he had three problems
[48:48] around
[48:50] him youth in itself is a
[48:54] problem you think you know
[48:57] more than everybody else that's the
[49:01] problem of being a
[49:06] youth this old men here they don't have
[49:09] any
[49:10] bra but you being old is
[49:14] wisdom praise the Lord but that's the
[49:17] problem of being
[49:21] young the next problem was wealth
[49:27] when people have
[49:29] money they become very
[49:36] arrogant they become so
[49:39] arrogant they begin to think they own
[49:42] the
[49:43] world and he had the third
[49:46] problem he was a ruler so let us have
[49:50] simpathy with this young
[49:52] man but one time he was first with the
[49:57] challenge of
[50:00] value he had come to a
[50:03] point and he had
[50:05] realized that eternal
[50:08] life in itself was more valuable than
[50:12] what he
[50:15] had amen so in verse
[50:19] 17 and when he was going forth into the
[50:23] way there came one running
[50:27] and this is the Rich Young
[50:29] Ruler and knelt down to him and asked
[50:33] him good
[50:34] Master what shall I do that I may
[50:37] inherit eternal
[50:42] life the man was faed with
[50:46] value he was controlling a
[50:50] territory he had
[50:52] money he had the fame of a
[50:55] youth when he started measuring what he
[51:00] had as opposed to eternal
[51:03] life he found out that eternal life is
[51:06] of Great
[51:09] Value he realized the
[51:13] AG and then he came
[51:16] running he was not walking he had heard
[51:20] that the master was in the
[51:22] area and he came running and he did not
[51:26] stand
[51:27] but he put all his power
[51:30] down he put all his wealth down he put
[51:34] his youth
[51:36] down he knelt down before the
[51:39] master because there is something he
[51:42] wanted to get out
[51:44] of amen he needed eternal
[51:48] life the only one who had
[51:51] the of how he could get eternal life
[51:56] says what must I
[51:59] do that I may inherit eternal
[52:03] life are you together with me so today
[52:07] we
[52:08] realize that eternal life is a
[52:11] geographical
[52:14] point where those who have got eternal
[52:18] life also dwell on one side it's
[52:23] geographical and in another life it is
[52:25] the quality of of
[52:28] life which is the life of God
[52:31] himself amen and he dwells in
[52:36] eternity so he says I want have an
[52:39] inheritance in
[52:41] eternity and some crazy
[52:44] people they start saying that now I can
[52:46] sell you a plot in heaven
[52:57] that God has got agents on Earth who
[52:59] sell his plots in
[53:02] heaven so you see the
[53:06] man F that eternal
[53:10] life is of Great
[53:13] Value but the problem with this
[53:16] man is that he wanted eternal
[53:19] life on top of what he had
[53:26] but then eternal life in
[53:29] itself there was a
[53:32] condition that you had to
[53:35] F in order for him to have
[53:38] it praise the Lord now in verse
[53:42] 19 thou knowest the
[53:45] Commandments do not commit
[53:48] adultery do not kill do not steal do not
[53:53] bear false
[53:54] witness defraud not
[53:57] thy father and
[53:59] mother and he answered and said unto
[54:02] him
[54:04] master all these have I observed from my
[54:11] youth you know and the Bible says Jesus
[54:16] beholding
[54:17] him loved him and said unto him one
[54:22] thing you
[54:24] lack because for you to have eternal
[54:27] life it's not just going to be
[54:31] a to what you have is going to be a
[54:36] takeaway to empty
[54:39] out so that eternal life can
[54:43] occupy the empty space therefore go thy
[54:48] way sell whatsoever you have give it to
[54:52] the poor and you shall have treasure in
[54:55] heaven
[54:57] and come and take up the cross and
[54:58] follow
[55:02] me the Bible says he had a lot of
[55:09] wealth so when he consider
[55:13] that looking at
[55:15] himself as poor as the rest of the
[55:19] people he
[55:20] knew he says I can I cannot my me
[55:27] look at like my
[55:29] neighbor who does not even have
[55:32] food no no
[55:36] no but the problem
[55:39] is the man did not have a conference
[55:42] with
[55:44] God sometimes we need a conference with
[55:48] God where God can
[55:50] speak and we speak back that's the
[55:54] difference between the Rich Young Ruler
[55:58] and the woman at the
[56:00] well the woman at the well had a
[56:03] conference with the
[56:05] master this man had conference with the
[56:08] master he would have come to the
[56:11] area of understanding what the master
[56:16] meant for him to sell all that he
[56:22] had that's the problem with people
[56:26] they judge
[56:28] god without giving him an
[56:31] opportunity to have a conference with
[56:34] him when you come to church you are
[56:37] having conference with God God is
[56:40] talking to you when you in your standard
[56:43] time you are in conference with God God
[56:46] is talking to you this man didn't give
[56:51] godun
[56:53] to a conference with him
[56:58] he made his own
[56:59] decision and he was
[57:02] sad at that
[57:04] same and went away
[57:08] G
[57:12] possession The
[57:14] Joy could only be
[57:17] found in the greater
[57:20] value one cannot hold
[57:23] Goods of contradicting value at the same
[57:32] time because you've got
[57:34] Goods of contradicting
[57:38] value they will always be one ultimate
[57:45] value amen you see you cannot hold two
[57:51] things and both of them read the same
[57:55] value
[57:57] it can't
[57:58] be are you together with me yes sir you
[58:03] need to take
[58:04] time and find out the True
[58:08] Value amen of the things that were
[58:12] involved
[58:14] with the things of the
[58:17] Kingdom amen now because like we are
[58:21] talking about the Prospectors
[58:27] amen those who go to prospect for
[58:31] gold maybe to prospect for
[58:35] Di Prospect for
[58:38] oil there are certain things that they
[58:41] must
[58:43] do first of all they must
[58:50] seek but this
[58:52] man did not seek into
[58:57] of the
[59:02] Lord you know he did not enter into the
[59:07] council Master what did you
[59:10] mean do you mean that only the poor that
[59:13] go to
[59:15] heaven he would have made him
[59:19] understand a little deeper than
[59:23] that and once he has s
[59:30] then he
[59:31] find hallelujah hallelujah we seek we
[59:36] find then we
[59:38] sell all the other
[59:41] things hallelujah hallelujah of less
[59:45] value to purchase the
[59:48] field which has the P of great
[59:54] price he did not do
[59:57] that so it
[1:00:00] means that we are
[1:00:03] confronted by the need to make a right
[1:00:07] decision always in
[1:00:12] life praise the Lord you see when you
[1:00:16] are
[1:00:17] first with two contr
[1:00:22] values take time
[1:00:26] and find
[1:00:27] out what holds the True
[1:00:34] Value because this
[1:00:36] man wanted to have this and wanted to
[1:00:40] have
[1:00:43] that and yet the
[1:00:46] master had given him
[1:00:49] anate you know
[1:00:53] cancel and told him
[1:00:57] sell follow
[1:01:02] me
[1:01:04] listen brother
[1:01:06] Bram lived his
[1:01:08] life by making right choices in
[1:01:14] life we need to
[1:01:17] learn how to make right
[1:01:22] counsels to make right decisions
[1:01:27] each time you make the right decision in
[1:01:31] life God gives you the
[1:01:34] strength to back
[1:01:37] up the right
[1:01:41] decision he only waits for you to make a
[1:01:45] decision the right
[1:01:48] decision the right
[1:01:50] decision and the moment you make the
[1:01:53] right decision
[1:01:56] God will always back
[1:02:00] up that
[1:02:02] decision if you always remain between
[1:02:05] two
[1:02:07] opinions you walk
[1:02:10] away amen like the rich young
[1:02:14] man you don't get what you're looking
[1:02:17] for make the right
[1:02:20] decision Amen brother BR in the message
[1:02:23] uncertain sound
[1:02:27] he's talking about uh
[1:02:30] uh uh you know the man who spoke in
[1:02:38] Tong in one of his
[1:02:41] meetings and then another
[1:02:44] man you know the man who spoke in
[1:02:47] tones actually spoke
[1:02:50] French but then another one could come I
[1:02:54] mean some men came
[1:02:57] and they say we know what this man is
[1:03:00] saying because that's
[1:03:04] French so it was
[1:03:07] interpreted and the Man I mean who was
[1:03:10] speaking in
[1:03:12] Tong he was actually
[1:03:16] God talking to brother
[1:03:18] BR saying because thou H has chosen the
[1:03:21] Narrow
[1:03:23] Path the hard way
[1:03:26] thou Hast make walked of thy own
[1:03:33] choos making a
[1:03:35] choice Moses had to
[1:03:38] walk of his own
[1:03:40] choosing he didn't have
[1:03:43] two but he made his
[1:03:46] decision thou has picked the
[1:03:50] correct and PR and precise the season
[1:03:56] and it is my
[1:03:58] way because of this momentous
[1:04:03] deis a huge portion of
[1:04:06] Heaven awaits the this in
[1:04:11] itself is that which will
[1:04:14] give and make come to pass the
[1:04:18] tremendous victory in the
[1:04:22] love hallelujah hallelujah God
[1:04:26] in his wisdom he puts two
[1:04:30] things of contradicting
[1:04:33] value and then he says what choice are
[1:04:37] you going
[1:04:39] back and you come to a
[1:04:41] moment a moment of
[1:04:44] prayer a moment of
[1:04:47] meditation you totally sell yourself to
[1:04:51] God and always the right
[1:04:53] thing we have the pool
[1:04:57] in a person's heart it will always pull
[1:05:01] and the right thing was eternal
[1:05:05] life the pull in this man's life but
[1:05:09] unfortunately the man made the wrong
[1:05:13] choice hallelujah hallelujah God gives
[1:05:16] you the
[1:05:17] choice he gave brother Bram the choice
[1:05:21] and when brother Bram made the choice he
[1:05:24] says yes
[1:05:26] that's my
[1:05:30] way the moment he
[1:05:33] presents is right there to guide you to
[1:05:38] make a
[1:05:41] decision praise the Lord so your right
[1:05:44] decision in
[1:05:46] life at the
[1:05:49] foundations to the tremendous
[1:05:52] victory in the love divine
[1:05:55] amen hallelujah so the Bible say the
[1:05:59] Kingdom of
[1:06:00] Heaven is like a treasure
[1:06:04] field treasure
[1:06:06] means a
[1:06:08] place in which
[1:06:11] good preure
[1:06:13] things are
[1:06:15] collected and laid
[1:06:17] up it's like a bank it's a treasure it
[1:06:23] keeps very precious things
[1:06:27] so the prospector
[1:06:29] therefore SS all that he
[1:06:33] has amen so that he
[1:06:37] may buy that
[1:06:40] field and possess the
[1:06:47] treasure I'm talking about value this
[1:06:51] morning sometimes we made choices
[1:06:55] that are totally
[1:06:58] valueless and they torment Us in
[1:07:03] life brother Bram says and our rights to
[1:07:07] the
[1:07:11] world we've sold
[1:07:16] out and bought this SP of great
[1:07:23] price we sold all right
[1:07:27] it's our right to be in the night
[1:07:30] club but we sold those
[1:07:34] right because you bought a
[1:07:37] power of great
[1:07:40] price you've got a right to dress and
[1:07:45] you expose your
[1:07:47] fraud but you don't do that you dress so
[1:07:52] nicely because you sold your rights
[1:07:56] to buy a pile of great
[1:08:00] PR you would have a
[1:08:02] dress like
[1:08:09] you but then you don't do that because
[1:08:13] you have got a choice in
[1:08:17] life amen and work and letting the Holy
[1:08:22] Spirit manifest itself
[1:08:26] that's what is real church
[1:08:28] is that's what you are you understand
[1:08:37] value praise the Lord with
[1:08:40] joy you sold your
[1:08:44] right to living your
[1:08:49] Liv amen like anybody else of the
[1:08:53] world you have a right to be parting
[1:08:57] somewhere drinking and
[1:09:00] gambling you go down it Sports and do
[1:09:04] whatever but you sold
[1:09:07] your and that's what
[1:09:10] God was asking the rich
[1:09:15] to sell your
[1:09:18] right come follow me did you s your
[1:09:22] right that's why you are here
[1:09:25] that's why you don't act like the
[1:09:28] world Abraham sold what he had in the
[1:09:31] land of the
[1:09:33] child to move into
[1:09:36] Canaan and in
[1:09:38] there God showed him a
[1:09:42] treasure heing called the
[1:09:46] value a
[1:09:48] land that would possess with his
[1:09:52] seed after him
[1:09:55] and when
[1:09:57] God was describing this
[1:10:00] land to Israel when they were going to
[1:10:04] possess
[1:10:05] it he called it a good land a
[1:10:11] large and a land flowing with milk and
[1:10:17] honey can you
[1:10:19] imagine he was describing
[1:10:22] Israel he was calling it a good
[1:10:26] land he was calling it
[1:10:29] large he was calling it a land flowing
[1:10:32] with milk and
[1:10:35] Hy he was describing the
[1:10:40] value God calling that little pass of
[1:10:45] land amen a large and good
[1:10:51] land which is be as small as mus
[1:10:58] are you together with me
[1:11:00] large simply because it was big enough
[1:11:04] for the
[1:11:06] purpose are you together with me amen
[1:11:10] don't look at your brother's
[1:11:13] house just have value in your own
[1:11:16] house it's big and
[1:11:20] large because it is now for the value
[1:11:24] the purpose
[1:11:27] amen sometimes we so much young to have
[1:11:32] like the one of brother
[1:11:35] Silas you know brother
[1:11:38] Silas in his mind he has a
[1:11:43] house if you need to
[1:11:48] know the people you open their
[1:11:52] mind then they plan
[1:11:56] a bedroom as big as this
[1:12:03] church but God says you don't need all
[1:12:07] that
[1:12:10] land and the little pass of
[1:12:13] land he's calling it
[1:12:16] good and
[1:12:18] large flowing with milk and
[1:12:22] honey and the song writer say
[1:12:27] little is much when God is
[1:12:31] there hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[1:12:34] Lord little is
[1:12:37] much when God is in
[1:12:40] it that little land
[1:12:42] there it controls the brain of the
[1:12:45] entire
[1:12:48] world it controls the wealth of the
[1:12:51] entire
[1:12:53] world it flows with mil
[1:12:57] and the richest
[1:12:59] men in America they are
[1:13:05] Jews you see it says
[1:13:10] large but good enough for the
[1:13:13] purpose so looking at the description of
[1:13:17] the
[1:13:17] [Music]
[1:13:19] land it was a
[1:13:22] blessing but Abraham
[1:13:25] needed
[1:13:27] SE for him to inherit
[1:13:31] it together with him in that
[1:13:35] land and you know
[1:13:37] God will always do certain things around
[1:13:41] us to help us realize the
[1:13:47] value God will do
[1:13:49] things to highlight
[1:13:52] value embedded in what is doing in our
[1:13:57] lives he trained
[1:14:00] Abraham to appreciating
[1:14:03] value of
[1:14:05] Isaac taking him 25 years in
[1:14:11] waiting when sah gave
[1:14:14] birth Abraham should have looked at this
[1:14:17] baby turn him this
[1:14:21] way his
[1:14:22] head that is value
[1:14:27] are you together with me sometimes there
[1:14:30] are certain things that we
[1:14:33] prefer and we will not
[1:14:36] realize how great they are in our
[1:14:40] lives they come so
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:44] simply God allows you to
[1:14:47] weigh and the more you
[1:14:50] wa is the more value
[1:14:55] keeps
[1:14:57] building and when it comes to you you
[1:15:01] lift up your hands you say thank you
[1:15:07] Father 40
[1:15:09] years in the
[1:15:11] wilderness God was building
[1:15:16] value in the minds of the children
[1:15:19] of so when they got in there brother it
[1:15:24] was joy and
[1:15:27] happiness
[1:15:28] amen when
[1:15:31] Solomon valed the
[1:15:36] kingdom amen God gave him
[1:15:39] wisdom because he had
[1:15:42] value for what God had put
[1:15:49] into you see what I'm saying God wants
[1:15:52] to teach us
[1:15:55] that kind of
[1:15:57] mind the mind that resports to
[1:16:02] Value God has invested in our
[1:16:05] lives and sometimes even the things
[1:16:09] around
[1:16:12] us if we don't
[1:16:17] value what God has given to
[1:16:20] us it's always very difficult to give
[1:16:24] God thanks
[1:16:26] when he does what he does for
[1:16:30] us now I've been talking about
[1:16:34] value of the things around
[1:16:37] us but I want to bring this
[1:16:40] value to us
[1:16:46] ourselves
[1:16:47] sometimes we look at
[1:16:50] ourselves and we don't give ourselves
[1:16:53] the kind of value
[1:16:58] which God attaches to
[1:17:02] us are you together with me he valued
[1:17:07] us and redeemed Us by his own
[1:17:13] blood that is Ultimate
[1:17:18] value cannot be anything
[1:17:22] greater than the blood of God himself
[1:17:26] because the life of the
[1:17:29] flesh is in the
[1:17:32] blood amen so we are
[1:17:35] worth the same value of the blood of
[1:17:40] God but how much
[1:17:43] value do we
[1:17:45] attach to
[1:17:47] ourselves and how much value do we
[1:17:51] attach to the blood of God
[1:17:56] God has had the
[1:17:59] path that he
[1:18:01] did to come and bring
[1:18:05] himself into our
[1:18:10] domain I want to take time and speak
[1:18:14] about
[1:18:21] value value
[1:18:25] ultimate
[1:18:28] value
[1:18:30] amen so he he had to come from
[1:18:35] eternity he came from what the Hebrews
[1:18:39] called
[1:18:42] Elohim and
[1:18:45] Elohim is
[1:18:47] God before even became
[1:18:50] God he God before he became a creator
[1:18:56] because he existed all by
[1:19:01] himself there was no Heaven there was no
[1:19:05] Earth because God created
[1:19:09] them so he was in a
[1:19:14] state where he needed
[1:19:18] nothing because he had no Angels around
[1:19:21] him he didn't have people around him
[1:19:25] he was by
[1:19:27] himself and the Hebrews know
[1:19:30] him as
[1:19:32] Elohim the one who exist on his
[1:19:36] own amen praise the Lord but then when
[1:19:41] he came to a
[1:19:44] point where he was going to do
[1:19:48] creation amen he needed to come into
[1:19:52] position
[1:19:55] of
[1:19:56] being amen so that that which is
[1:20:01] created could have something to look
[1:20:04] back
[1:20:07] to and so
[1:20:09] God just m himself a
[1:20:15] body which the Greek theologians called
[1:20:19] the
[1:20:23] logos amen
[1:20:25] it is at that
[1:20:27] stage that he spoke the creative
[1:20:32] word amen when he was in that
[1:20:37] logos he had built himself a
[1:20:41] body and now logos was a body of
[1:20:47] Light which
[1:20:49] light is totally different from our
[1:20:52] light
[1:20:56] so he created himself that
[1:21:00] body and that body cannot be
[1:21:04] seen by a natural man because it's a
[1:21:08] spirit
[1:21:10] body and when I die out of this body I
[1:21:15] also go into another body which is a
[1:21:20] body of
[1:21:21] Life called the
[1:21:25] are you together with me waiting for me
[1:21:29] to come back in the
[1:21:32] resurrection and pick up this one in a
[1:21:36] glorified
[1:21:40] form so
[1:21:42] logos was a body of
[1:21:45] Life totally different from this
[1:21:49] life brother Bram describes
[1:21:52] him with this words
[1:21:55] that the
[1:21:57] logos that went out of him become a
[1:22:01] little Hollow of
[1:22:06] light I'm taking it spiritual cph
[1:22:11] now and when this light came to meet
[1:22:15] sa on the way to
[1:22:18] Damascus praise the Lord this light here
[1:22:23] was am Mega light
[1:22:29] resolutions amen that
[1:22:32] Soul could not
[1:22:35] see he could not see
[1:22:37] him this was a blinding
[1:22:42] life his natural ey could not see
[1:22:46] through
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:48] that but yet he was
[1:22:51] conscious that he had met a supernatural
[1:22:54] being
[1:22:56] hallelujah hallelujah praise God out of
[1:23:00] that
[1:23:01] light
[1:23:04] voice why do
[1:23:08] you s
[1:23:10] knew this is not a man this is God then
[1:23:14] he says who are you my
[1:23:16] Lord he says I'm Jesus whom you
[1:23:22] persecute he had gone back
[1:23:25] into that original
[1:23:28] step hallelujah hallelujah that's the
[1:23:31] kind of light he
[1:23:33] is oh praise the Lord and the impact of
[1:23:37] that
[1:23:39] lighted in the life of
[1:23:43] sa until an prayed for
[1:23:47] him to be brought back into the
[1:23:55] that as a
[1:23:57] light in
[1:23:59] Genesis John called him the
[1:24:06] word because when he came into that
[1:24:11] form that's where he
[1:24:14] stands let there
[1:24:18] be so that
[1:24:21] light that God was was associated with
[1:24:25] the
[1:24:27] word and John
[1:24:30] 1:1 in the beginning was the
[1:24:34] word and the Word was with
[1:24:37] God and the Word was
[1:24:40] God okay but the
[1:24:44] word then took a
[1:24:50] turn and put on a
[1:24:53] body which
[1:24:55] body we know as the Son of
[1:25:00] God he
[1:25:03] fails and then came down to
[1:25:06] us John
[1:25:09] 11:4 and the Word was made flesh and
[1:25:14] dwelt among us and we beheld his
[1:25:18] glory the Glorious the only begotten of
[1:25:21] the father
[1:25:24] full of grace and
[1:25:27] truth so the
[1:25:31] Virgin amen what he gave birth
[1:25:35] to
[1:25:37] was the
[1:25:41] covering was
[1:25:45] theing of
[1:25:48] God
[1:25:49] God was that superal
[1:25:54] he was veiled in that
[1:25:56] body we could only look at
[1:25:59] him look at the humility of
[1:26:03] God the people of this
[1:26:08] Earth you see the only
[1:26:13] thing that shows
[1:26:16] God is
[1:26:21] humility the men of this world
[1:26:25] they like to show
[1:26:29] Power if you are a
[1:26:33] journalist or if you are a common
[1:26:36] man and you say bad
[1:26:39] word about the man in
[1:26:42] power you are in
[1:26:45] trouble but what
[1:26:48] shows that Jesus was
[1:26:51] God he could stand and take
[1:26:56] control of the power and authority which
[1:26:58] he
[1:27:00] had he could have stood and speak away
[1:27:04] this entire
[1:27:06] world as the
[1:27:10] Pharisees
[1:27:12] SES you know called him all kinds of
[1:27:16] names called
[1:27:20] him but Power
[1:27:24] under
[1:27:25] control that is
[1:27:29] God and when
[1:27:31] time he decided to take
[1:27:34] John Peter and James to the mountain to
[1:27:39] show them who he
[1:27:44] was and then he transfigured
[1:27:47] himself meaning that he got those men to
[1:27:51] see beyond the V
[1:27:58] and they saw
[1:28:00] him in the glorified
[1:28:03] for that we shall have with
[1:28:07] him after we've been
[1:28:10] resurrected then they saw here
[1:28:13] Moses they saw here Elijah and then they
[1:28:17] saw him
[1:28:18] himself are you together with me and
[1:28:21] they were so astounded
[1:28:24] you me this is the one we always play
[1:28:32] around that was
[1:28:34] God so for us to Value
[1:28:37] ourselves as Son of God we need to
[1:28:43] understand amen the worth of the
[1:28:47] blood that redeemed you because you are
[1:28:51] as valuable
[1:28:54] as the blood
[1:28:56] is that's the price of your
[1:29:01] soul you are as
[1:29:04] valuable as the
[1:29:08] money
[1:29:10] that this Bible is as
[1:29:14] worth as the money that
[1:29:17] buys so your soul is as valuable as the
[1:29:22] blood of God himself
[1:29:28] we are talking about
[1:29:30] Val and
[1:29:32] sometimes people can get valuable
[1:29:36] things and they play around with them I
[1:29:40] want tell you this morning don't play
[1:29:43] around with your
[1:29:44] soul your soul is so
[1:29:48] expensive your soul was bought by God
[1:29:53] himself he had to sell his own
[1:29:56] blood to purchase you that's how
[1:30:00] valuable you
[1:30:02] are so your soul must be
[1:30:05] friend your soul must be brought to the
[1:30:08] house of
[1:30:09] God are you together with me and when
[1:30:12] your
[1:30:13] soul is
[1:30:15] bought
[1:30:17] redeemed then your soul will begin to
[1:30:21] testify of what it is
[1:30:25] by the things on the outside of
[1:30:27] it Hallelujah hallu your soul will
[1:30:32] testify I'm a
[1:30:34] lady I'm very
[1:30:37] expensive I'm not
[1:30:39] cheap to go around putting paint on
[1:30:43] myself
[1:30:43] Soul hallelujah hallelujah my value is
[1:30:48] on the
[1:30:49] inside as
[1:30:51] expensive as God himself
[1:30:58] you don't die for something
[1:31:01] cheap
[1:31:04] value Amen brother Bram now shows us and
[1:31:09] he says God came down in a blood
[1:31:14] cell not through a
[1:31:16] man but by the Holy
[1:31:20] Ghost and in that virgin womb
[1:31:24] a tabernacle for the purpose of
[1:31:28] death was
[1:31:31] built God came down in a blood
[1:31:36] cell amen not through a
[1:31:39] man because I
[1:31:42] came by the power of a
[1:31:46] man are you together with me but that's
[1:31:49] not how Jesus
[1:31:51] came God Who is the
[1:31:54] word spoke himself into
[1:31:59] blood into the womb of the
[1:32:04] vir can you
[1:32:06] imagine God coming
[1:32:08] down amen for the purpose of
[1:32:12] death the seed of the woman came in
[1:32:18] order that he he be
[1:32:22] bruised to bring our
[1:32:24] salvation when the Holy Ghost Came Upon
[1:32:28] Mary he created within her
[1:32:32] womb the
[1:32:34] cell that would
[1:32:37] multiply and become the body of Our
[1:32:41] Lord that cell was
[1:32:45] created it was the beginning of the
[1:32:48] creation of
[1:32:50] God that's who Jesus is
[1:32:54] and that Holy
[1:32:56] One was filled with the Holy
[1:32:59] Blood even the blood of
[1:33:02] God that Tabernacle came in
[1:33:06] bir he grew to be a man he went to
[1:33:10] Jordan and there that
[1:33:13] sacrifice was washed of jining the River
[1:33:19] Jordan he was not baptized because he
[1:33:22] was a sinner
[1:33:25] but he was
[1:33:26] baptized because in the Old
[1:33:28] Testament the sacrifice had to be
[1:33:33] washed hallelujah hallelujah so that
[1:33:36] baptism was a washing of the
[1:33:41] sacrifice amen when that acceptable
[1:33:46] sacrifice rose out of the
[1:33:49] water came God
[1:33:51] came and him
[1:33:54] filling him with the spirit without
[1:33:58] Miss amen and when he died and shed his
[1:34:03] blood the perfect life of
[1:34:07] God was
[1:34:09] liberated to came back upon the
[1:34:13] sinner who would accept
[1:34:15] Christ as his
[1:34:18] savior hallelujah hallelujah that life
[1:34:21] comes down
[1:34:23] for you and
[1:34:25] me so God
[1:34:28] created his own
[1:34:30] body by speaking a blood
[1:34:34] cell in the wom of a
[1:34:36] virgin and
[1:34:39] therefore the
[1:34:40] blood to that body is the blood of God
[1:34:49] himself he created himself a body
[1:34:54] and then he came and dwed
[1:34:57] it because this is the
[1:35:03] pattern God you know when he was uh
[1:35:08] before the foundation of the
[1:35:11] world before he even had anything
[1:35:16] created he had me in his
[1:35:20] mind are you together with me I was a
[1:35:26] thought in his man waiting for a
[1:35:30] time when I would come into natural
[1:35:35] B to fit in my
[1:35:39] position so God and man have always been
[1:35:44] together God allows man to come upon the
[1:35:49] Earth to take
[1:35:52] control of all the creation that would
[1:35:56] make and because God allowed
[1:36:00] man to come into a natural
[1:36:03] world he also allowed man to have a
[1:36:07] natural
[1:36:08] body so that the
[1:36:10] creation could look back to the
[1:36:14] Lord in some form of
[1:36:17] substance hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:36:19] after that when we fell the only one God
[1:36:24] could redeem
[1:36:25] us was him to come into this
[1:36:31] substance where we are and so he became
[1:36:35] body and
[1:36:37] blood so us to be able to redeem us he
[1:36:41] are to become our
[1:36:45] brother by a birth in a
[1:36:48] body hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:51] hallelujah God created his own
[1:36:54] Body by speaking a blood
[1:36:58] cell in the wom of a virgin and there
[1:37:01] for that
[1:37:03] blood amen is the blood of God
[1:37:07] himself and
[1:37:09] we are
[1:37:11] Redeemed by the blood of
[1:37:14] God hallelujah hallelujah that's the
[1:37:17] altimate
[1:37:20] value that you should be attached to
[1:37:22] your soul
[1:37:28] do you see what I'm
[1:37:29] saying
[1:37:31] your your your
[1:37:33] soul can only be
[1:37:37] computed into the value of the blood of
[1:37:43] God can you play with such a
[1:37:49] value are you together with me natural
[1:37:52] men
[1:37:54] when they have
[1:37:55] cars and they love their
[1:37:58] car they wouldn't want a child to play
[1:38:02] with natural
[1:38:04] things which pass
[1:38:06] away there is a
[1:38:08] soul on the inside of you God redeemed
[1:38:13] it by the cost of his own
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:20] blood such value
[1:38:24] should not be sunk into garbage
[1:38:28] stuff amen saying that you are
[1:38:34] gambling gambling that
[1:38:37] value in the night
[1:38:40] club with such a
[1:38:42] value
[1:38:44] alcohol with such a value prostitution
[1:38:48] with such a
[1:38:49] value you should not Gamble that
[1:38:57] value it's ultimate
[1:39:03] value you were
[1:39:05] bought by the blood of God
[1:39:09] himself I take you to the book of
[1:39:13] Acts chapter
[1:39:15] 20 verse
[1:39:19] 28 if you knew the value
[1:39:23] you would always have time for
[1:39:27] God but because we don't understand the
[1:39:31] value we may not have
[1:39:34] time for the things of
[1:39:39] God Acts
[1:39:42] 20 verse
[1:39:44] 2 he says take he therefore unto
[1:39:47] yourselves Paul was speaking to the
[1:39:49] Elders of the church
[1:39:54] and all the
[1:39:56] flock over which the Holy Ghost has made
[1:39:59] you
[1:40:01] overseers to feed the Church of
[1:40:04] God which he has
[1:40:06] purchased with his own
[1:40:10] blood amen so the blood of
[1:40:14] God released the life of
[1:40:18] God to baptize us into the family of God
[1:40:24] as Sons and
[1:40:27] Daughters I thought somebody would
[1:40:31] say so my birth into the family by B of
[1:40:36] the Holy
[1:40:39] Ghost makes
[1:40:41] Christ become the first
[1:40:45] born among many
[1:40:48] brother because he's a Son of
[1:40:50] God is the firstborn
[1:40:54] he's my brother do you see the value
[1:40:57] that you now get
[1:40:58] to because of the blood you are
[1:41:03] elevated to a level of
[1:41:07] Brotherhood with the Lord Jesus
[1:41:12] Christ
[1:41:14] value let's talk about
[1:41:16] value
[1:41:18] Amen brother Bram says
[1:41:21] here he's one of us
[1:41:24] he's our King
[1:41:29] FK oh my he's my
[1:41:32] brother he's my savior he's my God he's
[1:41:37] my Kingsman
[1:41:39] Redeemer he's my all so what was
[1:41:45] there without
[1:41:49] him without
[1:41:53] what would you be
[1:41:57] without you see so you see he's my
[1:42:03] all he is standing
[1:42:06] there as our King
[1:42:09] folks and now he's been interceding for
[1:42:14] us till this
[1:42:17] time and now he comes forth to take the
[1:42:22] book of
[1:42:24] Redemption to claim his rights of what
[1:42:27] he did for
[1:42:29] us are you together with me yes sir that
[1:42:34] is
[1:42:39] him praise the Lord he so much protects
[1:42:45] you like we saw last time the names in
[1:42:48] the
[1:42:50] book you are so precious
[1:42:53] but do we attach that value back to
[1:43:00] the oh we are
[1:43:02] children you buy a kid a very nice
[1:43:06] little
[1:43:07] suit so that he can also appear as a
[1:43:13] gentleman and the next thing is playing
[1:43:15] in the
[1:43:19] D is that what we are do we attack
[1:43:25] value because our
[1:43:28] value can only be computed together with
[1:43:34] God nothing else can buy
[1:43:38] you praise the
[1:43:40] Lord
[1:43:44] amen he's doing that because you were in
[1:43:48] him before the foundation of the
[1:43:50] world you were Spirit of
[1:43:54] Spirit but when you stepped into
[1:43:56] flesh you were deceived by sin so you
[1:44:00] had to come in the same
[1:44:03] flesh where you
[1:44:05] sinned so that he could redeem you
[1:44:08] back amen so that you can
[1:44:12] become substance of his
[1:44:15] substance hallelujah
[1:44:20] hallelujah do you love him yes sir God
[1:44:24] values your
[1:44:27] soul listen to The Prophet

[1:44:40] it
[1:44:42] listen what is the
[1:44:45] soul it is
[1:44:48] you whatever you
[1:44:50] do is your soul
[1:44:55] are you together with me whatever you do
[1:44:59] is your soul so when you
[1:45:02] realize there is something that's not
[1:45:05] right that have come through my
[1:45:09] life you need to go back to the Fountain
[1:45:13] of
[1:45:14] blood and
[1:45:16] emphasize that I'm a Child of God by
[1:45:19] putting your sin under the blood
[1:45:23] that means you understand your
[1:45:27] value amen you are a
[1:45:30] soul the part inside of
[1:45:34] you and when you die ever what shape
[1:45:38] that so is
[1:45:40] it that's the way it goes It goes to its
[1:45:45] destination you pull it up no matter how
[1:45:49] much you don't you would
[1:45:54] that so is got to be changed
[1:45:58] here born
[1:46:02] again are you together with me so the

[1:54:44] value for you to understand
[1:54:47] it you have your
[1:54:49] clothes you go and buy a shirt
[1:54:53] it is so
[1:54:55] beautiful and when you put it on there
[1:54:58] is a way you feel like you
[1:55:04] are you in the
[1:55:12] present and then after two
[1:55:20] years no
[1:55:25] how could you wear that suit of the
[1:55:30] people the things of this
[1:55:33] world they are falling
[1:55:38] value we attached to
[1:55:42] them but they pass
[1:55:44] away brother Bram tells a
[1:55:49] story of the 1926
[1:55:53] old
[1:55:58] T he owned at the age of 16 or
[1:56:03] 17 and tells how he spent
[1:56:07] time every day polishing
[1:56:11] that polishing
[1:56:13] it and he had very great value for
[1:56:16] it he could turn
[1:56:19] aside look at it
[1:56:22] Gish
[1:56:25] it he attached Great Value to that
[1:56:29] car but when he was telling the
[1:56:33] story he was in his 40s at that
[1:56:37] time he
[1:56:39] wonders saying he would
[1:56:42] wonder if pieces of that car were
[1:56:45] brought to him
[1:56:51] now he wouldn't even want to drive
[1:56:54] it the things of this
[1:56:57] world the value
[1:57:02] Falls you have the
[1:57:04] money the value
[1:57:07] Falls you've invested in
[1:57:12] Friendship the value
[1:57:15] Falls
[1:57:20] that was now
[1:57:26] because it was not ultimate
[1:57:31] value anything that has
[1:57:35] value
[1:57:37] Falls brother then poses a
[1:57:42] question and he
[1:57:44] said what is
[1:57:48] value he posed the question
[1:57:52] he
[1:57:53] said what is
[1:58:00] value and that's the answer that we need
[1:58:03] to
[1:58:05] have he answers and
[1:58:10] says well after Sunday afternoon Sunday
[1:58:15] morning I would go
[1:58:18] down and sharpen all the bits
[1:58:22] and things for the air
[1:58:25] compressor and clean it up sunnd
[1:58:30] afternoon polish
[1:58:33] the it looked like a paint would almost
[1:58:37] come
[1:58:39] off what if I tried this morning to find
[1:58:43] one piece of that
[1:58:46] for what if I tried one of these bits of
[1:58:50] that air compressor
[1:58:54] the same time I could be winning
[1:58:59] Souls I was polishing my
[1:59:03] f i
[1:59:05] wonder where is
[1:59:14] value all these other things we
[1:59:18] have they could be things of value
[1:59:23] you could have a
[1:59:25] house it's of Great Value but there's
[1:59:29] only
[1:59:30] one that has ultimate
[1:59:35] value and that is your
[1:59:39] soul it is as
[1:59:42] expensive as God is you need to feed
[1:59:46] yourself you need to bring it into
[1:59:50] fell it is the only ultimate
[1:59:54] value of the things of the
[2:00:00] world brother the ultimate
[2:00:04] value but one so sa brother
[2:00:09] says you will see your name wrapped into
[2:00:15] it as long as the Morning Star shall
[2:00:18] glitter
[2:00:20] it so he say
[2:00:22] let us save
[2:00:25] Soul starting on your
[2:00:31] own give it
[2:00:34] regard give it
[2:00:37] time I can't be your
[2:00:41] T not your good
[2:00:44] house not your
[2:00:49] achievement praise the Lord
[2:00:52] they could be
[2:00:54] great but I want you to
[2:00:57] deal with
[2:01:00] timate which is your
[2:01:03] soul the value in
[2:01:05] Gold it
[2:01:09] perishes you go to a shop buy a
[2:01:14] car the moment you drive
[2:01:17] out you cannot get the same money you
[2:01:20] bought
[2:01:22] as long as you are
[2:01:27] out the god that
[2:01:32] perishes because it
[2:01:34] perishes by failure to maintain
[2:01:40] value and that's what people fight
[2:01:43] for is the money but it can't hold
[2:01:49] value because of money
[2:01:52] even Judas sold his
[2:01:57] soul and that man couldn't hold the
[2:02:01] value at the time of the
[2:02:04] challenge that man wouldn't meet his
[2:02:09] satisfaction he threw it away went and H
[2:02:14] him what is
[2:02:17] value answer it is my soul
[2:02:23] it is so
[2:02:29] Ultimate Gold
[2:02:33] perishes but the
[2:02:35] soul is an eternal
[2:02:39] value came from
[2:02:41] God cannot be killed in
[2:02:44] time on the way back to
[2:02:48] God that's the only thing that's times
[2:02:52] the test of
[2:02:54] time your
[2:02:57] soul
[2:03:02] listen the value in God
[2:03:07] perishes brother Bram says but there's a
[2:03:10] gold of
[2:03:16] God first Peter
[2:03:18] 1:7 the tri of your
[2:03:24] Faith being much more
[2:03:28] precious than of
[2:03:31] gold that
[2:03:33] pures the
[2:03:35] train of your
[2:03:38] faith is more
[2:03:41] precious than a billion Shillings given
[2:03:44] to you
[2:03:54] because this
[2:03:56] gold will perish we lose
[2:04:00] value
[2:04:02] but there is something
[2:04:05] Eternal when you
[2:04:07] uphold the value of your
[2:04:11] soul uphold that
[2:04:14] value tell your
[2:04:17] soul this way don't go I will not do
[2:04:21] that
[2:04:23] I don't I deny
[2:04:25] that my praise is the praise of God
[2:04:29] himself praise God the god of
[2:04:34] God is a Christlike
[2:04:38] character producing the fin of
[2:04:46] Affliction that is the right kind of God
[2:04:52] your
[2:04:54] character is a
[2:04:58] star in your
[2:05:00] crowd okay but what kind of gold does
[2:05:04] the church have
[2:05:07] today it has but the worldly God that
[2:05:10] will
[2:05:13] perish the church is
[2:05:15] rich is
[2:05:19] compl it has made
[2:05:22] the major Criterion of
[2:05:34] spirituality the evidence of God's
[2:05:38] blessing and the correctness of
[2:05:41] Doctrine is now based on how many folks
[2:05:44] are involved in it
[2:05:52] how many people in that
[2:05:54] church I don't go that one that
[2:05:59] one what is there they've lost the
[2:06:05] standard you had better come before it's
[2:06:08] too
[2:06:09] late says the Lord and by of
[2:06:14] me God tried in
[2:06:18] Fire and when you be truly rich
[2:06:23] are we getting
[2:06:25] it listen to me
[2:06:29] naked physically we came into the
[2:06:34] world but naked
[2:06:38] spiritually we will not leave it
[2:06:41] hallelujah
[2:06:44] hallelujah we've got
[2:06:46] a that gains value in service
[2:06:52] while we came naked
[2:06:55] naturally
[2:06:57] spiritually we shall not go
[2:07:00] naked hallelujah hallelujah we shall go
[2:07:03] loed with
[2:07:06] stars the soul keeps gaining
[2:07:11] value no we are going to take something
[2:07:14] with
[2:07:16] us what that something
[2:07:18] is is all we can take with
[2:07:24] us nothing less and nothing
[2:07:28] more so we had better be real careful
[2:07:32] now to see that we take
[2:07:36] something that will make us right before
[2:07:40] God so then what will we take with
[2:07:45] us we will take our
[2:07:49] character amen amen hallelujah
[2:07:52] hallelujah rather that's what we will
[2:07:54] take with
[2:07:55] us now what kind of character will you
[2:07:58] take with
[2:07:59] you will it be like his whose character
[2:08:04] was moded by suffering in
[2:08:10] fire amen or will it be the softness of
[2:08:14] this
[2:08:16] character AG
[2:08:22] it's up to each one of
[2:08:24] us for in that day every man will bear
[2:08:29] his own
[2:08:34] body learning to
[2:08:38] attach the
[2:08:41] value to the soul like a
[2:08:45] godes
[2:08:50] it God
[2:08:52] values
[2:08:55] your you know the
[2:08:57] Devil is a
[2:09:00] preacher of prosperity
[2:09:03] wealth Prosperity
[2:09:07] Gospel
[2:09:12] that's going to get even build a house
[2:09:25] are you together with me that's not a
[2:09:27] spiritual
[2:09:29] blessing because we are here we are
[2:09:32] conscious of what we ought to
[2:09:35] do that we must work and build a home
[2:09:40] care for the family amen buy a car but
[2:09:45] if that becomes the
[2:09:47] promise that makes you a child of God
[2:09:51] the devil's
[2:10:00] gopel I see you in one year you are
[2:10:04] driving he
[2:10:09] already so he knows in that year I think
[2:10:12] the brother will buy a
[2:10:22] you
[2:10:23] see the Devil is a
[2:10:27] preacher of
[2:10:30] prosperity and
[2:10:35] wealth and
[2:10:38] health is the backbone of his
[2:10:41] [Music]
[2:10:45] gospel
[2:10:47] theil would glorify the rich man
[2:10:51] over
[2:10:53] Lazarus saying
[2:10:55] Lazarus you are a man of God and the
[2:10:59] dogs are leaking
[2:11:03] your when he looks at the rich
[2:11:10] Manus great
[2:11:12] home wonderful
[2:11:15] Farms one time he came to a point of
[2:11:20] saying
[2:11:24] now I've bu the
[2:11:28] G I have got a great
[2:11:33] Yi let me just have and put in the
[2:11:36] [Music]
[2:11:38] G and
[2:11:40] rest that's how stupid he
[2:11:43] was he computed his
[2:11:45] wealth to being
[2:11:48] spiritual and God called him a fool
[2:11:52] you fo your soul will be needed
[2:12:01] today so the
[2:12:03] devil you know he believes that people
[2:12:06] come to
[2:12:08] church for two
[2:12:11] things
[2:12:16] health and
[2:12:19] wealth he doesn't know that people come
[2:12:22] to
[2:12:24] church for the welfare of their
[2:12:29] soul and when the soul
[2:12:32] prospers the blessing comes down to the
[2:12:35] body the wealth comes the healing comes
[2:12:40] you don't have to meas
[2:12:42] them and you take away the people's
[2:12:45] concern for the
[2:12:48] soul and they care for
[2:12:52] which God will certainly give to
[2:12:56] them so we had a
[2:12:58] church that was going
[2:13:01] on way back even before
[2:13:04] Moses that was the Church of
[2:13:09] job job lived before all the
[2:13:13] prophets job lived before all Moses
[2:13:19] leave because after
[2:13:22] Moses every book of the Bible which was
[2:13:26] written Moses was
[2:13:28] quoted but not job he lived before
[2:13:34] Moses so there was a church
[2:13:38] service in Job
[2:13:40] 1
[2:13:42] verse the devil came around walking back
[2:13:46] and
[2:13:48] forth and God was asking Satan
[2:13:53] what his interest was in the
[2:13:56] service then Satan answered the
[2:14:00] Lord you know first of
[2:14:03] all he says I'm just from up and walking
[2:14:07] up and
[2:14:10] down
[2:14:13] the is not
[2:14:17] specific and
[2:14:19] down but
[2:14:22] you've got your week
[2:14:28] planned W
[2:14:30] night church Sunday
[2:14:33] morning
[2:14:35] church and Sunday
[2:14:37] evening we've got the Lord's
[2:14:41] Supper you've got your
[2:14:43] days
[2:14:45] properly planned
[2:14:47] out but the devil wakes up without a
[2:14:53] plan then God asks him I know what you
[2:14:57] are looking
[2:14:59] for have you considered my servant
[2:15:04] J who is
[2:15:06] upright excuse
[2:15:09] for and nobody's like
[2:15:11] him listen to the Prosperity
[2:15:15] Gospel
[2:15:17] verse then Satan answered the Lord
[2:15:22] and
[2:15:23] say does job fear God for
[2:15:30] nothing has not Thou made a h about
[2:15:36] him and about his
[2:15:38] house and about all that he has on every
[2:15:43] side have you not bless the work of his
[2:15:48] hands and his substance is increased in
[2:15:51] the
[2:15:52] land but put forth thine hand
[2:15:57] now and touch all that he
[2:16:00] has and he will cast thee on the
[2:16:04] first that's the preach of
[2:16:08] prosperity and the Lord said unto
[2:16:11] Satan behold all that he has is in
[2:16:17] thy only
[2:16:21] upon
[2:16:21] [Music]
[2:16:28] himself so Satan went
[2:16:31] forth from the presence of the Lord this
[2:16:35] upon
[2:16:38] himself upon
[2:16:42] himself refers to the most
[2:16:47] valuable which is the soul of job
[2:16:52] Satan tamper with all that job
[2:16:57] has but he has something very
[2:17:01] valuable don't touch that
[2:17:05] song
[2:17:15] God do you care for your
[2:17:18] soul said the devil came and bat down
[2:17:21] the
[2:17:23] we and job was not
[2:17:26] moved again he came into the
[2:17:31] next sometimes we must be very
[2:17:34] careful I don't know why I'm thinking
[2:17:37] the

[2:57:04] Lord I'm just going to pick a few
[2:57:09] highlights praise the name of our Lord
[2:57:11] and I believe we shall need a service on
[2:57:13] Church
[2:57:16] order just a service praise the name of
[2:57:18] our Lord and see and see the basis of
[2:57:21] many of these things that we have to do
