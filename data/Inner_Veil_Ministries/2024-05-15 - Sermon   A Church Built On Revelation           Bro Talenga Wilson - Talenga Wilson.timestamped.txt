[40:15] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[40:18] Prevail against it
[40:32] may the Lord add a blessing to his word
[40:34] we may get
[40:36] seated I want to also draw you to the to
[40:40] a quot
[40:43] here in in exposition of the seven
[40:46] Church
[40:48] ages in the revelation of Jesus
[40:51] Christ the prophet says the Roman
[40:54] Catholics say that the church is built
[40:56] upon Peter
[41:00] now that is
[41:02] real how could God build the church Upon
[41:06] A man so unstable that he denied the
[41:08] Lord Jesus and cast while doing
[41:21] it God can't build his church upon any
[41:24] man born in sin
[41:28] and it wasn't some rock lying there as
[41:30] though God had allowed the
[41:35] ground at that spot and it isn't as the
[41:39] Protestants
[41:41] say that the church is built upon
[41:45] Jesus it was the
[41:48] Revelation read it the way it is
[41:50] written flesh and blood has not revealed
[41:55] it but my father has revealed
[42:00] it and Upon This Rock of
[42:04] Revelation I will build my
[42:07] church the church is built on
[42:11] Revelation on thus say the
[42:14] Lord praise the name of living God so
[42:18] now here Jesus when he was speaking to
[42:20] the
[42:21] disciples he asked them a
[42:25] question yes who do they people say that
[42:28] I the son of man
[42:31] am praise the Lord because Jesus had had
[42:35] what the people spoke
[42:36] about he know what the people had spoken
[42:40] about all the sorts of names that they
[42:43] called but he wanted an answer from the
[42:48] disciples you who have been taught of me
[42:51] tell me what do people say that I the
[42:53] son of man
[42:55] am and some said some call you
[42:59] Elias some John the
[43:01] Baptist some call you
[43:03] Jeremiah or even one of the prophets but
[43:06] he desired a straight answer from
[43:11] them praise the Lord and he said unto
[43:14] them but whom do you say I
[43:19] am and they looked at one another then
[43:23] it took
[43:24] Peter praise the Lord Peter that stood
[43:27] up and
[43:28] said you are the Christ the son of the
[43:33] Living God and when he spoke it Jesus
[43:37] answered him and said blessed thou
[43:41] Peter for FLH and
[43:44] blood has not revealed this unto
[43:48] you flesh and blood has not given you
[43:52] this
[43:53] revelation of who the son of man I am
[43:57] but he said but it is my father who has
[44:00] given you this
[44:01] Revelation and then he said Upon This
[44:05] Rock praise the Lord Upon This
[44:09] Rock I will build my
[44:12] church praise the Lord and here the
[44:14] prophet has
[44:15] said the Catholics say that the church
[44:19] is built upon
[44:21] Peter because when Jesus said I say un
[44:23] thee thou Peter
[44:27] they now say now you see Jesus
[44:29] quoted and say is you
[44:32] Peter and Upon This Rock but Peter was
[44:37] not a
[44:38] rock why because the prophet said down
[44:42] here Jesus the Bible says Peter denied
[44:46] Jesus three
[44:47] times he not stand his ground so there
[44:51] is no way God could build a church upon
[44:54] Peter as a man
[44:57] as a man he could
[44:59] fail God can never build his
[45:02] church upon the foundations of a
[45:05] man why because man
[45:09] fails but he said that you are
[45:12] Peter Upon This Rock The Rock of
[45:16] Revelation the Revelation that Peter
[45:20] had who the son of man is the Revelation
[45:24] that you have know who the son of is is
[45:28] that Revelation that God buil his
[45:32] church praise the name Living God th
[45:36] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[45:40] church and said the Protestants say that
[45:43] it's built on
[45:45] Jesus but the prophet of our says that
[45:49] the church is buil upon
[45:54] Revelation praise the Lord upon this
[45:58] Revelation I will build my church so now
[46:01] we want to
[46:03] study praise the lord we want to draw so
[46:05] many
[46:06] scriptures from the Old Testament on how
[46:10] God has built his
[46:13] church upon nothing else but his
[46:17] Revelation praise the lord we can draw
[46:20] now to Genesis
[46:22] 4 and and quote out verse three
[46:27] verse 5 praise the Lord this speak about
[46:30] Cain and
[46:32] Abel praise the Lord and the sacrifice
[46:35] that they brought before the
[46:37] Lord and in the process of time it came
[46:40] to
[46:40] pass that Cain brought of the fast of
[46:44] the ground and offering unto the Lord
[47:03] and he also brought of the firstlings of
[47:06] his flock and of the F thereof and the
[47:09] Lord had respect unto Abel and his
[47:11] offering
[47:21] AB but Cain un his offering he had not
[47:25] respect and Kane was very rough and his
[47:29] countenance
[47:39] fell now we notice that when these two
[47:44] children of of of of Adam brought the
[47:47] offering before the
[47:50] lordering had a
[47:53] purpose praise the Lord remember Adam
[47:56] and he had
[47:58] fallen and had come short of
[48:01] Grace and they had been driven out of
[48:03] the Garden of
[48:05] Eden and now it came it came to pass
[48:09] that they produced Kan and
[48:11] Abel and this grew
[48:14] up and they were of sound
[48:16] mind and they had a
[48:19] desire to have fellowship with God had a
[48:23] desire reconciled to God each of them
[48:27] had a
[48:28] desire serve the Lord and now it came to
[48:32] pass that they each wanted to please
[48:36] God and now Cain the says he brought of
[48:40] the uh he brought it came to pass that
[48:42] Kan brought of the fruit of the ground
[48:44] and offering unto the
[48:48] Lord he went to his garden and he picked
[48:52] the best and he came and gave it unto
[48:55] the Lord
[48:57] praise the Lord and then Abel who says
[49:00] he brought of the firstlings of his
[49:06] flock and of the
[49:09] thereof the Lord had respect for Abel's
[49:15] offering and the Lord rejected that of
[49:18] Cain why because this offering that they
[49:22] brought before
[49:24] God hard to please God
[49:27] something that pleases you it should be
[49:30] something that you like it should be
[49:32] something that is a part of
[49:34] you something that is in your mind so
[49:37] now AB he got the mind of
[49:41] God the revelation of God and now he
[49:45] went and brought of the fings of his
[49:50] flock why because in the mind of God for
[49:55] reconciliation only thing that God
[49:58] provided was the shed blood even when
[50:02] even when Adam had
[50:03] sined praise the Lord he had heed for
[50:06] himself
[50:08] leaves but that's not what God
[50:10] desired God himself came down and he
[50:14] killed the lamb and blood was shed and
[50:18] then he closed them with a skin and so
[50:21] Abel went into the mind of God prise the
[50:25] Lord got the
[50:28] Revelation what God
[50:30] required for Fellowship he got the
[50:34] Revelation what God required for
[50:37] reconciliation that's why he went to his
[50:40] flock and get of the fing of his
[50:43] FL and the first one and he came and he
[50:48] presented it before the Lord praise the
[50:51] name Living God and now how did Abel get
[50:54] that how to take God
[50:57] himself to get his mind and give it to
[51:01] AB God got his mind revealed his man to
[51:06] AB and told AB what he
[51:09] required by
[51:11] Revelation Abel got of the flock and
[51:15] heer unto the Lord Upon This Rock The
[51:19] Rock of
[51:20] Revelation I will build my church praise
[51:24] the Lord so now Abel was building an
[51:28] altar upon which he would stand to
[51:31] Worship the Lord when he was trying to
[51:34] create a
[51:37] Reconciliation him and God he had to
[51:40] make an
[51:42] offering was in the mind of
[51:45] God praise the Lord and it is God that
[51:49] gave it unto him it is God that gives us
[51:53] his
[51:54] Revelation and the word revelation means
[51:59] unveiling unveiling
[52:01] something so God had to unveil his
[52:05] mind unveiled the purpose for the
[52:09] offering and then he unveiled it before
[52:12] before
[52:13] ab ab knew exactly what to
[52:17] do praise the Lord remember this is the
[52:21] first thing that they had
[52:22] BR they had not seen their father do it
[52:27] so they were puzzled on what they had to
[52:30] bring praise the Lord but God by
[52:37] knowledge AB was of the seed of
[52:41] Adam and because Abel was of the seed of
[52:45] God he was in the mind of God so he get
[52:49] through the mind of God a revelation of
[52:52] what God desired for his
[52:54] day praise the Lord he had to get now to
[52:58] where God had
[52:59] ordained for you to atone for your
[53:03] sins and get reconciled back to me you
[53:06] need to shed blood praise the Lord
[53:10] remember in Leviticus 4 when God spoke
[53:13] to Moses when he was giving him the
[53:17] instructions on how the children of
[53:20] Israel would get reconciled from sin and
[53:24] get reconciled back to fellowship
[53:27] whoever had
[53:28] sin God spoke to him and said the Bible
[53:32] says in in lus 4:2 verse
[53:35] one and the Lord spoke unto Moses
[53:39] saying Speak unto the children of Israel
[53:43] saying if the soul shall sin through
[53:47] ignorance against any of The
[53:48] Commandments of the Lord concerning
[53:50] things which ought not be
[53:53] done and shall do against any of them
[53:58] if the priest that is Anointed do to do
[54:01] if the priest that is Anointed do sin
[54:03] according to the sin of the
[54:12] people then let him bring for his sin
[54:15] which he has seened a young bulock
[54:17] without blemish unto the Lord for a sin
[54:19] offering
[54:32] and he shall bring the block unto the
[54:34] door of the Tabernacle of the
[54:35] congregation before the Lord and shall
[54:37] lay his hand upon the Bullock's head and
[54:40] kill the bulock before the Lord
[55:03] now this was ahead of
[55:06] time and God was speaking to children of
[55:10] Israel the
[55:12] reconciliation and atonement for their
[55:15] sin and now here we find Abel that he
[55:19] went ahead of
[55:21] time praise the Lord and he got the
[55:24] instruction that God had provided
[55:29] atonment and so when he was bring the
[55:32] offering he brought exactly what was in
[55:35] the mind of
[55:37] God what was that it was based upon
[55:44] Revelation had to take
[55:46] God because God was establishing a
[55:51] tabac it was it was establishing an
[55:54] altar upon Abel could stand to Worship
[55:58] the
[55:59] Lord upon which ab could serve the
[56:02] Lord praise the Lord so he had to get
[56:05] into the pattern of God by
[56:08] Revelation to bring that which was
[56:11] acceptable before the
[56:12] Lord and Upon This Rock
[56:15] of I will build my church praise the
[56:19] Living God that does not make it doesn't
[56:23] mean that Kan was not sincere
[56:27] in his offering he was sincere that's
[56:30] why he got annoyed when God did not
[56:34] appreciate his
[56:35] offering because he toed to bring it he
[56:40] toiled he went to Pi of the best of his
[56:44] Harvest so he was a sincere man and he
[56:48] had a desire to please
[56:51] God and so he did his
[56:54] best to build the relation relationship
[56:56] back with
[56:58] God praise the Lord but it had to be by
[57:03] Revelation it had to be by Revelation
[57:06] that man could please
[57:08] God regardless of how good his offering
[57:12] was as long as it was not in the mind of
[57:16] God and as long as it was not after the
[57:19] pattern of
[57:20] God it couldn't please
[57:24] God praise the Lord so God rejected it
[57:28] but yet he tried his
[57:30] best it had be by
[57:33] Revelation know perfectly what God
[57:36] wanted praise the Lord he got this
[57:40] Revelation and he got this Revelation
[57:43] and he gave it to
[57:44] AB and did exactly what God
[57:48] wanted and the prophet says how did Abel
[57:51] know what to do in order to offer a
[57:53] proper sacrifice to God
[57:57] by faith he received the revelation of
[58:01] God of the
[58:03] blood by faith
[58:07] AB received the revelation of the
[58:11] blood
[58:13] didn't get such
[58:16] Revelation even though he had a
[58:19] commandment so he couldn't over the
[58:22] right
[58:23] sacrifice it was a revelation from
[58:27] God that made the
[58:29] difference and and gave AB eternal
[58:34] life it was the
[58:37] Revelation praise the Lord it had to be
[58:40] the
[58:41] Revelation praise the Lord that AB
[58:45] received and when he received it by
[58:49] faith he accepted it and he believed it
[58:53] and he went ahead to execute
[58:56] praise the Lord the Church of Jesus
[59:00] Christ the Church of God has to be built
[59:03] upon his
[59:05] Revelation because the revelation of God
[59:09] unveils the mind of God reation of gods
[59:14] the purpose of
[59:15] gods the pattern of
[59:18] God it brings us into
[59:21] knowledge of the person of Jesus
[59:24] Christ and Who We Are
[59:27] before him it gets us into the
[59:30] knowledge ration of the vision of the
[59:33] Bride in Jesus Christ and without that
[59:38] Revelation the church cannot stand
[59:41] without that revelation of the person of
[59:42] Jesus
[59:43] Christ the church cannot be
[59:46] built praise the Living God and now the
[59:51] Bible says in First Peter 2:9
[59:58] praise the Lord you are a chosen
[1:00:02] generation a generation that has been
[1:00:06] chosen to know
[1:00:08] God to receive the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:12] Christ I know him
[1:00:15] personally he says you are a chosen
[1:00:19] generation Our royal
[1:00:23] priesthood our holy nation
[1:00:26] A peculiar people that you should show
[1:00:29] forth the Praises of him who has called
[1:00:31] you out of the darkness Into His
[1:00:34] Marvelous Light
[1:00:36] that's chapter 2 verse 9
[1:01:06] and how do we know we are a chosen
[1:01:10] generation how do we know that we are
[1:01:12] peculiar
[1:01:13] people how do we know we are a special
[1:01:16] people the word peculiar means
[1:01:20] special
[1:01:22] unique
[1:01:24] separated set up apart so we are
[1:01:27] peculiar people that have been
[1:01:30] separated and set
[1:01:33] apart by the message of Malachi
[1:01:36] 4 praise the Lord which is the voice of
[1:01:39] the seventh
[1:01:41] angel praise the Lord which brings us
[1:01:44] the message and the
[1:01:46] revelation of the person of Jesus
[1:01:50] Christ get the
[1:01:52] revelation of the person of Jesus Christ
[1:01:56] and revelation of who we are so the
[1:01:59] message of
[1:02:00] Mali it what places us into our
[1:02:04] position positions of knowledge to know
[1:02:07] who you are and where you are standing
[1:02:11] in the gospel who you are and where
[1:02:14] you're standing in Jesus Christ praise
[1:02:18] the Lord and so he says now that you
[1:02:20] have this
[1:02:21] knowledge after you have received this
[1:02:25] revelation
[1:02:27] you are a chosen
[1:02:29] generation you are a pecul people You'
[1:02:33] been set aside set apart for what you
[1:02:37] have received the of Jesus Christ and
[1:02:40] you have received of the life of Jesus
[1:02:43] and that makes you a special person that
[1:02:46] is awaiting the rupture you are a
[1:02:49] special people have got the knowledge of
[1:02:52] the mind of God in our
[1:02:56] of
[1:02:57] Mal praise the Lord and so now it's upon
[1:03:02] this
[1:03:03] message the Church of Jesus Christ is BU
[1:03:07] today this message the message of Jesus
[1:03:11] Christ the message which is the
[1:03:14] revelation of Jesus Christ his message
[1:03:18] is not
[1:03:19] will this message is not the voice
[1:03:24] of this message is the revelation of
[1:03:28] Jesus Christ the Bible says I think in
[1:03:31] Revelation CH 10 that at the sounding of
[1:03:34] the seventh
[1:03:35] angel when he shall begin to
[1:03:39] sound mysteries of God should have been
[1:03:44] finished as declar servants the prophets
[1:03:47] and now this is the
[1:03:49] time where the seventh angel has
[1:03:52] sounded the Bible says the sounding of
[1:03:56] that seventh
[1:03:57] angel William Bram at the time of his
[1:04:01] message he says now the mysteries of God
[1:04:05] the revelation of God should have been
[1:04:09] unveiled before the bride to know who
[1:04:12] she is and come into full
[1:04:16] revelation of the person of Jesus Christ
[1:04:20] and upon that
[1:04:21] revelation of who she is upon the
[1:04:24] revelation
[1:04:26] of Jesus Christ this church is
[1:04:29] built this church is built upon the
[1:04:34] revelation of Jesus Christ this church
[1:04:36] is not built upon the foundation of
[1:04:40] Bram praise the Lord just like the
[1:04:43] prophet said that God could not build
[1:04:45] his
[1:04:46] church Upon A man
[1:04:49] Peter because man
[1:04:51] fails God has to build his church
[1:04:56] upon his
[1:04:58] Revelation praise the Lord and our
[1:05:01] church the church of the
[1:05:03] Bride church is fully
[1:05:06] built upon that
[1:05:09] tribulation and that's why call us a
[1:05:12] peculiar people very special because we
[1:05:16] have the
[1:05:17] revelation of who you are you know you
[1:05:21] special people because you received him
[1:05:25] Christ who makes you special
[1:05:29] AB received this Revelation and he
[1:05:32] believed it and it made him special
[1:05:35] that's why he offered a special
[1:05:38] offering before the Lord you are special
[1:05:42] because you have received the word of
[1:05:44] God says Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:05:49] but my word will never pass away you
[1:05:52] have received the word of God I have
[1:05:55] received the word of God so I have
[1:05:57] received the
[1:05:58] revelation of who Jesus is and Heaven
[1:06:02] and Earth shall pass
[1:06:04] away this word which you have received
[1:06:08] shall never pass away and upon that
[1:06:11] Revelation Christ will build his church
[1:06:15] this Church of Jesus Christ is built
[1:06:18] upon his
[1:06:20] Revelation praise the name of the Living
[1:06:22] God and the prophet says in the same
[1:06:26] message the exposition of the seven
[1:06:27] Church
[1:06:28] ages now you may take what your pastor
[1:06:31] says you may take what your pastor say
[1:06:34] or what the Seminary
[1:06:36] teaches and though it may be taught to
[1:06:39] you with
[1:06:42] eloquence until God reveals to you that
[1:06:45] Jesus is the
[1:06:48] Christ and that it is the blood that
[1:06:51] cleanses
[1:06:53] you and that God is your
[1:06:56] savior you will never have eternal
[1:07:00] life it is the spiritual Revelation that
[1:07:03] does
[1:07:04] it he says you may sit under your
[1:07:08] pastor and your pastor May teach you and
[1:07:12] yes he can teach you with a lot of
[1:07:14] eloquence but until God himself reveals
[1:07:19] this to
[1:07:23] you this revelation
[1:07:26] until God
[1:07:28] himself revealed itto
[1:07:31] Peter and said the person that standing
[1:07:34] before
[1:07:35] you is Jesus the
[1:07:38] Christ and the prophet says until God
[1:07:40] reveals it to you that Jesus is the
[1:07:44] Christ the same Revelation that was
[1:07:47] given unto
[1:07:49] Peter the same Revelation that is given
[1:07:51] unto
[1:07:52] us know that Jesus is the Christ
[1:07:57] he says until you come to know
[1:08:00] that that it is the blood that cleanses
[1:08:04] you not your good works not your Good
[1:08:08] Conduct but that the blood that cleanses
[1:08:11] you and that God is your savior says you
[1:08:15] will never have eternal
[1:08:17] life it is the spiritual Revelation that
[1:08:20] does
[1:08:21] it and says in another part but
[1:08:25] prevailing overcoming
[1:08:28] church is built on
[1:08:31] Revelation so we can expect
[1:08:34] God to reveal his
[1:08:37] truth to us if the church is not built
[1:08:41] upon the foundations of
[1:08:43] man praise the Lord and is built upon
[1:08:46] the foundations of the revelation of
[1:08:49] God that means the church will depend on
[1:08:52] Revelation
[1:08:55] will depend on the direction of the of
[1:08:58] the Holy
[1:08:59] Spirit the preachers the teachers the
[1:09:04] apostles praise the Lord will all be led
[1:09:07] by revelation of the word of
[1:09:10] God as they are being led by of the word
[1:09:13] of God they are able to bring the mind
[1:09:17] of God to the
[1:09:19] church praise the Lord they are able to
[1:09:22] bring the truth of the word to the
[1:09:23] church
[1:09:26] to reveal the truth of us without that
[1:09:30] Revelation there is no the
[1:09:33] church can come to
[1:09:35] knowledge of the truth of Jesus Christ
[1:09:39] praise the Lord it says you can be
[1:09:41] taught
[1:09:42] well praise the Lord but until you get
[1:09:46] the
[1:09:47] Revelation that there is but one God you
[1:09:51] cannot have this eternal life you until
[1:09:54] you have the revelation
[1:09:56] until you have the
[1:09:58] Revelation that Jesus Christ is but our
[1:10:02] God you cannot come you cannot have this
[1:10:06] eternal
[1:10:07] life is eternal life the person of Jesus
[1:10:11] Christ himself it is the life of God
[1:10:14] himself that he gives unto us freely by
[1:10:18] his
[1:10:20] grace and because he is
[1:10:22] eternal receive of his life we have
[1:10:26] received
[1:10:27] Eternal and so we become Eternal and we
[1:10:30] know it is simply a matter of
[1:10:32] time praise the Lord when we get to know
[1:10:36] and come this
[1:10:38] revelation of who you are that you are
[1:10:41] not who you are what you are seeing but
[1:10:45] you are bearing the life of Jesus
[1:10:48] Christ praise the Lord you now come to
[1:10:51] know that it is simply a matter of time
[1:10:56] praise the Lord and the scripture shall
[1:10:58] be fulfilled but when we shall see
[1:11:02] him when we shall see him we shall look
[1:11:06] at him and we shall know that he is
[1:11:11] praise the Lord as we are we shall see
[1:11:14] him and we look at ourselves and we see
[1:11:17] ourselves in him why because he has
[1:11:20] given us a part of his life because the
[1:11:24] life that we are bearing
[1:11:26] the life is eternal Jesus Christ
[1:11:29] himself praise the Living God and that's
[1:11:32] what the Revelation does it has revealed
[1:11:35] unto us the person of who we are the
[1:11:39] same Revelation that went down to job
[1:11:43] and revealed to him who he was even when
[1:11:47] he saw that he was Ro he had
[1:11:50] expectation he had hope that it was a
[1:11:53] matter of time praise the Lord that's
[1:11:56] why he confessed and said even if his
[1:11:59] body Ro praise the Lord he knew that at
[1:12:02] the end of the day he will see his Gods
[1:12:06] praise the Lord that is the the hope
[1:12:08] that we have that even if our
[1:12:12] bodies die before the rapture we know
[1:12:16] that it shall be a matter of time and
[1:12:19] still we shall be changed praise the
[1:12:22] lord we have that hope because we have
[1:12:25] the
[1:12:26] revelation of who Jesus Christ is Upon
[1:12:30] This Rock I will build my church praise
[1:12:34] the Lord and He will never give up on
[1:12:38] his
[1:12:39] church he will never give up the church
[1:12:43] that is been built upon his Revelation

[1:13:12] message that's right I guess many of you
[1:13:16] didn't I wouldn't have done it I
[1:13:19] guess myself I couldn't have done it
[1:13:22] unless God revealed it to me
[1:13:25] it is a
[1:13:27] revelation the church is built on that
[1:13:30] Revelation without the
[1:13:33] Revelation you'll never see
[1:13:35] it you are
[1:13:38] blind praise the Lord when you read the
[1:13:40] Bible the scripture say that the true
[1:13:44] baptism is in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:48] without the
[1:13:49] Revelation you can never see it when the
[1:13:52] scripture says you should worship and
[1:13:55] serve only the Lord God only one God SC
[1:14:00] says the Lord is but one
[1:14:03] God without Revelation you cannot see it
[1:14:07] when the scripture say the fullness of
[1:14:10] the
[1:14:11] godhead embed in Jesus
[1:14:14] Christ without Revelation you cannot see
[1:14:17] it you still see through existence of
[1:14:21] God prise the Lord when Jesus said
[1:14:25] unless you eat of My Flesh and drink of
[1:14:28] my blood you have no part of me you have
[1:14:31] no part in me and you have no eternal
[1:14:33] life without Revelation you cannot see
[1:14:37] what Jesus was speaking about without
[1:14:40] Revelation praise the Lord you cannot
[1:14:43] have the
[1:14:44] hope that the Rapture will come without
[1:14:48] the Revelation when you read Mal 4
[1:14:52] praise the Lord you cannot see
[1:14:55] the scripture in Mali 4 is declaring the
[1:14:58] coming of two
[1:15:00] prophets the first that is going to
[1:15:02] declare the first coming of Jesus
[1:15:05] Christ that is going to take the heart
[1:15:07] of the
[1:15:09] children their
[1:15:11] father Lord you cannot see malach
[1:15:16] 45 is the voice of the seventh angel
[1:15:19] without the Revelation you cannot come
[1:15:22] into the
[1:15:23] knowledge of the word of God
[1:15:26] see it you shall be told unless you you
[1:15:30] receive this
[1:15:32] Revelation you cannot receive it and
[1:15:35] believe
[1:15:36] it we are are very peculiar
[1:15:40] people
[1:15:42] generation God has allowed us to receive
[1:15:46] of this
[1:15:47] revelation of who we
[1:15:50] are people God has given us the grace to
[1:15:54] get
[1:15:55] Revelation praise the Lord and the
[1:15:58] things that we look at as
[1:16:00] simple are not simple before the eyes of
[1:16:03] men praise the Lord when you first heard
[1:16:07] when you first heard about the
[1:16:11] scripture when you first
[1:16:15] heard when Peter was
[1:16:17] preaching said unto them when they asked
[1:16:21] him what shall we do that we may receive
[1:16:25] this
[1:16:26] life and the and Peter said repent each
[1:16:30] one of you and be baptized in the name
[1:16:33] of Jesus Christ praise the Lord without
[1:16:36] Revelation you can you can read that
[1:16:39] scripture many years praise the Lord and
[1:16:43] you will not see that you will not see
[1:16:48] that the true
[1:16:49] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ but
[1:16:53] when Revelation knocks your way
[1:16:56] the Lord you don't need so many
[1:16:57] scriptures
[1:16:58] about when you first heard about it and
[1:17:02] Peter was proclaiming and
[1:17:04] said each one of you and bapti in the
[1:17:07] name of Jesus Christ he said I receive
[1:17:10] it somehow you believed it you didn't
[1:17:13] need to know that Jesus at one point he
[1:17:17] told his disciples when he was with them
[1:17:19] and had made them at the
[1:17:21] mountain he said go
[1:17:23] out preach the gospel and make rest of
[1:17:27] the world my
[1:17:28] disciples Bing in the
[1:17:31] name you didn't need to be told that
[1:17:34] Jesus Christ is that name that Jesus was
[1:17:39] referring to when you heard it because
[1:17:42] of Revelation you believed it and you
[1:17:46] took it up praise the Lord you didn't
[1:17:48] need another explanation about because
[1:17:51] you already had a revelation the
[1:17:53] Revelation was before you and Christ
[1:17:56] himself was making himself known to you
[1:18:00] he didn't need a third part
[1:18:02] explanation Revelation they read the
[1:18:06] scripture many read the
[1:18:08] scripture they don't believe it because
[1:18:11] they are not a part of it we are are
[1:18:14] chosen
[1:18:15] people the Lord we are people that have
[1:18:18] receive this
[1:18:19] Revelation and upon this
[1:18:22] Revelation I will build my church
[1:18:25] praise the Lord he said until God
[1:18:29] revealed it himself unto
[1:18:33] you without the Revelation you will
[1:18:36] never see
[1:18:39] it so I'm just going to put this
[1:18:43] in so you'll understand that's the
[1:18:46] prophet he say so I can give you a
[1:18:48] little spot of Grace
[1:18:51] here when ain't going to be too long
[1:18:55] you're going to change your
[1:18:56] mind some of you some of you
[1:19:00] w't but remember when Sarah first heard
[1:19:04] that that man when which she is a type
[1:19:07] of the
[1:19:09] church when she had that seen that sign
[1:19:13] take place to
[1:19:15] Abraham she actually laughed about it in
[1:19:17] her
[1:19:20] heart and disbelieved and doubted it
[1:19:25] ever being
[1:19:26] so it is that right at that time God
[1:19:30] would have rubbed her
[1:19:33] off would have rubbed her name
[1:19:36] off but he
[1:19:38] couldn't she's a part of
[1:19:42] Abraham and if you've really not been
[1:19:47] excited and walked up in
[1:19:50] Emotion not got some not got some church
[1:19:56] but really receive the Holy
[1:19:59] Ghost and you really part of
[1:20:02] Christ and still a little skeptic in
[1:20:04] your
[1:20:07] mind that God will not shove you off
[1:20:10] from
[1:20:12] that and said and you and you have a
[1:20:15] little a little skeptic in your mind God
[1:20:18] will not shove you off from
[1:20:23] that you have really received the Holy
[1:20:27] Spirit and you are cly part of
[1:20:30] Christ you still get a little skeptic in
[1:20:33] your
[1:20:37] mind God will not shove you off from
[1:20:40] that because he can't a part of Christ
[1:20:45] he will bring you to the
[1:20:47] truth by his
[1:20:50] Revelation praise the Lord just hang in
[1:20:53] there Behold a great than Solomon is
[1:20:57] here now if we talk
[1:21:02] fundamentalism if we talk about
[1:21:08] fundamentalism being
[1:21:17] fundamental now was just as fundamental
[1:21:20] as was
[1:21:26] both boys was wait was wanting to find
[1:21:28] favor with
[1:21:31] God brought a
[1:21:33] sacrifice buil an
[1:21:37] altar just as sincere as
[1:21:40] was but Abel by spiritual
[1:21:44] Revelation on which the Church of Jesus
[1:21:47] Christ is
[1:21:49] built spiritual revelation of the will
[1:21:51] and the word of God
[1:21:54] off a sacrifice that God was pleased
[1:21:57] with praise the Lord and now I believe
[1:22:00] that's the day that we are living
[1:22:03] in Praise the Lord yes sir it isn't what
[1:22:07] and how good a person
[1:22:11] is was a good person was very good and
[1:22:15] he obeyed the
[1:22:17] Commandment bring an offering before the
[1:22:19] Lord he was obedient before the
[1:22:22] Lord the Lord so it isn't how good you
[1:22:25] are praise the Lord but it must be the
[1:22:28] revelation of
[1:22:30] God praise the lord we can take another
[1:22:33] scripture we see that when had received
[1:22:36] that
[1:22:38] dream praise the Lord he
[1:22:41] interpretation and we know that
[1:22:44] God has always had his
[1:22:48] influence in every age God has always
[1:22:52] had his words
[1:22:54] estblished among his people and God has
[1:22:57] already shown his
[1:22:59] Revelation upon his people he shines his
[1:23:04] Revelation every
[1:23:06] dispensation and now in the times of
[1:23:09] Nezar we he had his people
[1:23:12] there praise the Lord he had Daniel he
[1:23:17] had
[1:23:18] shra and the rest of them there praise
[1:23:22] the Lord and so he called
[1:23:25] to have a
[1:23:26] dream and he caused him forget that
[1:23:30] dream but yet he knew that he had he had
[1:23:33] had a
[1:23:34] dream praise the Lord so now he woke up
[1:23:38] and he came to his people I said I had a
[1:23:42] disturbing
[1:23:43] dream I don't know what the dream was I
[1:23:47] don't know what the dream meant so he
[1:23:49] needed
[1:23:50] people to get to get into his mind
[1:23:55] the mind of God to bring down this dream
[1:23:59] and so he went his
[1:24:01] mag and he T them please I want know the
[1:24:08] dream and they they
[1:24:11] struggled King we can tell you this is
[1:24:16] not possible only the gods can do
[1:24:20] this man cannot get this revelation
[1:24:25] the dream that you have received what
[1:24:28] were they doing they were testifying
[1:24:31] it's only possible with
[1:24:33] god dream be made known praise the Lord
[1:24:38] and now he passed a decree he passed the
[1:24:43] decree was going to kill all the wise
[1:24:46] men they brought Daniel before him and
[1:24:50] Daniel said King just give us a little
[1:24:54] time
[1:24:55] give us a little time we shall come back
[1:24:58] here and we shall tell you the dream
[1:25:02] interet what was he doing he was waiting
[1:25:05] on Revelation from
[1:25:07] God he moved away from the Pres of the
[1:25:10] king his people and they went to pray
[1:25:14] and fast they waiting on the mind
[1:25:17] of you are waiting God to bring down his
[1:25:21] mind you are waiting God to unveil his
[1:25:23] mind
[1:25:26] because God had revealed his mind to
[1:25:30] nebz didn't know what it
[1:25:33] was God himself to bring his
[1:25:38] Revelation give it to his church that
[1:25:41] the church could be established and when
[1:25:43] they wait on the Lord they kept waiting
[1:25:46] on the Lord they knew that only God
[1:25:49] could do it so they went to inquire of
[1:25:52] the Lord and they waited
[1:25:55] on that Revelation and when it came to
[1:25:57] pass the of the Lord came down the
[1:26:01] spirit of the Lord came down it fell
[1:26:04] upon Daniel and said Daniel you are a
[1:26:08] chosen
[1:26:09] generation people a priesthood I will
[1:26:14] make
[1:26:15] known my mind to you I
[1:26:19] unil the person of me before you my
[1:26:23] church
[1:26:24] in this place may be established and so
[1:26:28] God gave the
[1:26:30] Mind God gave the dream until Daniel and
[1:26:34] Daniel came the following day he came
[1:26:37] smiling he praising the
[1:26:39] Lord he was full of
[1:26:41] Revelation he had received the
[1:26:44] Revelation he was not afraid to go and
[1:26:47] stand before
[1:26:48] NE instantly the church was established
[1:26:53] and the of the Lord for those men
[1:26:57] increased and the church was established
[1:27:02] upon that
[1:27:03] Revelation that even when it came to
[1:27:05] pass that nezeh again he laid a SN
[1:27:10] before the
[1:27:12] church he
[1:27:13] made he made an image this image that it
[1:27:17] should
[1:27:20] be shadra
[1:27:24] and
[1:27:25] ab they had received this
[1:27:28] Revelation and they had built upon the
[1:27:33] Revelation is but one God and only that
[1:27:37] God should be when they came out and
[1:27:41] they had they had the
[1:27:43] instruction that there was another God
[1:27:45] to be
[1:27:46] wor said no we have the revelation we
[1:27:50] have the knowledge that there are is by
[1:27:52] one God only him should
[1:27:55] be and they said even if it means death
[1:28:00] We Shall Not Bow Down To Worship that
[1:28:03] other God why because the church has
[1:28:06] been
[1:28:07] established upon the Revelation that
[1:28:10] there is but one God and the Lord Jesus
[1:28:13] Christ praise the Living God this church
[1:28:17] today been built upon that rock has been
[1:28:21] built upon that
[1:28:23] revelation there is but one God the Lord
[1:28:27] Jesus Christ and regardless of the
[1:28:31] distress
[1:28:33] regardless of the
[1:28:35] persecution this church is
[1:28:38] established and it shall not
[1:28:41] STG and he shall not come short of this
[1:28:44] Grace he shall not come short of this
[1:28:47] wisdom knowledge that there
[1:28:50] is but one God praise the living
[1:28:55] always establishes his
[1:28:57] church upon his
[1:28:59] Revelation praise the Lord yes sir he
[1:29:02] did the same thing Jacob praise the Lord
[1:29:07] the same way he visited
[1:29:09] AB the man he visited
[1:29:13] Jacob remember Isaiah 43
[1:29:18] ver1 God calls
[1:29:21] Jacob his own people
[1:29:24] because Israel my own
[1:29:28] people and now how did
[1:29:32] God praise the Lord come to calling
[1:29:36] Israel
[1:29:39] people given Jacob the
[1:29:43] Revelation upon which he would build the
[1:29:47] na Israel praise the Lord there was a
[1:29:50] time we all read the scriptures there is
[1:29:53] a time
[1:29:55] when ISAC was going to
[1:29:58] bless bless and
[1:30:01] Jacob was the first BN but he sold his
[1:30:06] birth he had
[1:30:08] sold he had sold it to
[1:30:11] Jacob and he wanted to steal it
[1:30:13] away at the time of being blessed so
[1:30:17] their father was old and he was striken
[1:30:20] in age and he couldn't see
[1:30:24] praise the Lord but now Jacob was a fair
[1:30:28] man praise the Lord And now when the
[1:30:31] time came both of them just like it was
[1:30:36] with and C they both had to bring
[1:30:40] something before
[1:30:42] their praise the Lord and now you know
[1:30:46] what is was
[1:30:48] doing went
[1:30:50] hunting because he knew what his father
[1:30:52] wanted
[1:30:54] and now
[1:30:55] Jacob God had to provide a
[1:30:58] way for Jacob to receive this BL because
[1:31:04] Jacob he had been
[1:31:06] predestinated receive this BL he had
[1:31:09] been
[1:31:11] predestinated out of out of him that God
[1:31:14] could form a nation out of Jacob God had
[1:31:19] promised Abraham that he would out of
[1:31:22] him would come
[1:31:24] and this was come by
[1:31:26] Jacob at that time want to take that
[1:31:31] place somehow God
[1:31:34] provided it is Jacob who received that
[1:31:38] blessing praise the Lord and now we see
[1:31:41] that when it came to Isaiah
[1:31:45] 413 verse one says now thus say the Lord
[1:31:51] God that created thee oh Jacob
[1:31:54] that he that formed thee oh Israel fear
[1:31:58] not for I have redeemed Thee I have
[1:32:02] called thee by thy
[1:32:04] name thou
[1:32:06] mine when thou passest through the
[1:32:11] waters I will be with
[1:32:14] youe this is a
[1:32:17] confirmation this is a God is trying to
[1:32:21] confess
[1:32:24] confession that God to
[1:32:26] Jacob because Jacob had received this
[1:32:31] Revelation who God
[1:32:33] was jaob had received
[1:32:36] this and now we are peculiar people God
[1:32:40] has chosen us and he has given us his
[1:32:44] Revelation he says I have chosen thee
[1:32:48] and I have created thee fear not I have
[1:32:52] redeemed thee I have called thee by your
[1:32:55] name for you are mine and therefore when
[1:32:59] you pass through the
[1:33:01] waters that church that is built upon
[1:33:05] the the foundation of of Jesus

[1:35:45] Revelation and moved by that
[1:35:49] Revelation even they even when they came
[1:35:52] the cures
[1:35:54] remember when Moses was moving the
[1:35:56] children of
[1:35:57] Israel and wanted to cast
[1:36:00] them praise the Lord and he had caused
[1:36:03] balam to C them because the promise of
[1:36:06] the Lord was with
[1:36:08] them and the of the Lord was with them
[1:36:12] there were a people that had been chosen
[1:36:15] to believe and worship only
[1:36:18] one and so the pris of God was with
[1:36:22] them they knew who they
[1:36:24] were and even if the curses came there
[1:36:28] the curses could not touch
[1:36:31] them praise the Lord the Cur could not
[1:36:33] touch them because they were a people of

[1:37:35] revelation of Jesus Christ he knows that
[1:37:39] even if these troubles come I have a
[1:37:42] promise the promise of the father he
[1:37:45] says he shall go before me and as long
[1:37:48] as that promise still
[1:37:50] stands this trouble shall come
[1:37:53] go before me shall L the ground a
[1:37:57] promise that is given to that
[1:37:59] church as long as friends we anchor upon
[1:38:04] that that promise we an our faith upon
[1:38:07] the promises of God we an ourselves upon
[1:38:11] that
[1:38:13] Revelation he said here when he was
[1:38:16] speaking to
[1:38:17] Jacob that I shall go before he shall go
[1:38:21] before us in every way
[1:38:24] even if world come our
[1:38:27] way Christ himself he will come and you
[1:38:32] come
[1:38:33] the why because you've anchored our
[1:38:37] fa upon that
[1:38:40] word our
[1:38:42] faith upon the
[1:38:44] revelation of Jesus Christ praise the
[1:38:47] Lord let me read out the last
[1:38:49] here in the same message is here
[1:38:54] he says now God in all
[1:38:57] ages always had gifts in his
[1:39:00] church has always Vindicated his
[1:39:03] people wherever you see the Living
[1:39:07] God you see the signs of a living
[1:39:11] God now there was a mo upon the
[1:39:16] hill and he was
[1:39:18] offering he had seven
[1:39:21] altars did and he had seven
[1:39:25] blocks he had seven
[1:39:27] RS that bulock a clean
[1:39:31] sacrifice R speaking of the coming just
[1:39:35] one
[1:39:39] rally he was just as fundamental as
[1:39:42] Moses
[1:39:45] was but the only difference was
[1:39:49] that God was confirming Moses by a smed
[1:39:52] rock
[1:39:55] and and a
[1:39:58] serpent and a pillar of
[1:40:01] fire of a king in there and God was
[1:40:06] vindicating that down
[1:40:08] there that is the difference so God had
[1:40:12] provided to the children of
[1:40:14] Israel praise the Lord he provided them
[1:40:17] with a pillar of
[1:40:18] fire praise the Lord and they were
[1:40:21] sure that the presence of God was with
[1:40:24] them and each time they were moving in
[1:40:28] the darkness of night the of fire was
[1:40:31] there praise the Lord so even when they
[1:40:36] errored praise the Lord and now the
[1:40:39] snakes started biting them here and
[1:40:41] there God provided another
[1:40:44] sign that his presence was seal with
[1:40:49] them
[1:40:50] happen looked up there
[1:40:54] he was healed and that made a difference
[1:40:57] whoever believed it when they were
[1:40:59] beaten I looked
[1:41:01] there they did not die but whoever did
[1:41:05] not believe after they were SM and they
[1:41:08] didn't look there they died that's what
[1:41:12] made the
[1:41:13] difference praise the Lord their FA had
[1:41:17] been built upon this Foundation they
[1:41:20] knew they had a pillar of Fire
[1:41:23] Lord and the Propet says and what made
[1:41:25] the difference was that God was
[1:41:28] confirming
[1:41:30] Moses by a SM by a smen
[1:41:34] rock a
[1:41:36] serent a pillar of fire praise the Lord
[1:41:40] in the
[1:41:42] camp that the King was
[1:41:45] there God was
[1:41:47] vindicating he was down
[1:41:50] there and now to us he has given us his
[1:41:54] word he has given us his promise praise
[1:41:57] the Lord and we know that his promises
[1:42:00] as
[1:42:01] Eternal and he never fails he never
[1:42:05] fails in his
[1:42:06] promis praise the Lord when he promised
[1:42:11] Jacob the Lord promised him that even if
[1:42:15] your you my
[1:42:17] people go through the fire you will not
[1:42:20] be burned and it came to pass
[1:42:24] when M and his friends when they went
[1:42:26] through the fire they were not burned
[1:42:30] his promises never failed so if he has
[1:42:33] given us his promise of etal life we
[1:42:35] sure know that we have eternal life
[1:42:39] praise the Lord he has promised us that
[1:42:43] he shall come back to take us in the
[1:42:46] rupture surely know that one of these
[1:42:49] days he shall come back for us and shall
[1:42:52] take the r his promises for his church
[1:42:57] never failed why because he has
[1:43:00] established this
[1:43:01] church upon his own
[1:43:04] Revelation that is a God and that is our
[1:43:08] church don't buil upon man bu upon the
