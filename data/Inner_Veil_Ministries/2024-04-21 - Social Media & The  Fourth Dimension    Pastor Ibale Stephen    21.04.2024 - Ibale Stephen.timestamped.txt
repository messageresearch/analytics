[41:17] world when you are still in your
[41:19] physical
[41:21] body so it's going to be a very special
[41:24] Dimension we deal with today
[41:29] and then from the fourth
[41:31] dimension then you begin to touch the
[41:35] spirit
[41:37] world where The Fifth
[41:41] Dimension is
[41:43] Hell the sixth
[41:45] Dimension is
[41:47] Paradise which was lifted
[41:50] up which uh the scripture would refer to
[41:54] as under the altar
[41:59] and then the seventh
[42:01] Dimension is what we would call the
[42:04] third
[42:05] Heavens the aboard of God
[42:10] himself amen so life spiritual and
[42:16] natural is experienced through seven
[42:21] levels and science cause those levels
[42:24] dimensions
[42:28] so I've told you between the natural
[42:33] world and then the spirit
[42:36] world there is a middle
[42:40] spot which we call
[42:42] Faith or we can call
[42:45] channel in you stand between the natural
[42:48] world and the spirit
[42:51] world so now the natural
[42:55] man normally through three uh Dimensions
[43:00] the first three
[43:01] [Music]
[43:03] dimensions which is
[43:05] light without light you cannot be
[43:09] operate and then the second one is
[43:13] matter whatever you deal with is
[43:17] matter if it's food if it's your
[43:21] friend if you are going to
[43:23] work that's the level of matter
[43:28] and then
[43:29] time so whatever you
[43:32] have you know you do you are doing it
[43:36] because you care how much time you
[43:40] have you needed light to be
[43:44] here you needed matter to be
[43:47] here because you watching over
[43:51] time that's how you live in the natural
[43:54] world so your natural senses
[43:58] they operate through those three
[44:01] dimensions they operate by natural
[44:06] evidence because you've got five senses
[44:09] as a
[44:12] person one of the senses is
[44:16] sight and then the next one is you
[44:20] hear then the third one you can
[44:23] test and then the next one you can feel
[44:27] when you are there and something touches
[44:30] you you said that's not part of
[44:33] me and then the fifth one you can
[44:37] smell okay so but there is a spiritual
[44:41] part of each one of
[44:44] us and this spiritual part of
[44:47] us has a spiritual
[44:52] detector and this detector might be a
[44:55] holy test
[44:59] or a you know a wicked
[45:02] test depending on the spiritual status
[45:05] of the
[45:08] individual you find a man he always
[45:12] desires holy
[45:14] stuff he wants to be in the presence of
[45:17] the
[45:18] Lord he wants to
[45:20] pray he wants to be
[45:23] postive he wants to
[45:25] study that is his
[45:28] and then there are some other
[45:31] people that you know may come to
[45:34] church but they don't care if they
[45:37] don't they don't care to study they
[45:41] don't care to pray then there are those
[45:44] who are completely
[45:46] gone they always desire to have some
[45:51] path amen something like
[45:55] drugs alcohol
[45:57] go out in a wild party of something like
[46:01] that so now there is the natural
[46:05] you and then there is the spiritual
[46:08] you the natural you
[46:11] here which is five
[46:14] senses which lives in the four three
[46:18] dimensions he goes to
[46:21] sleep when he's tired you just knock
[46:25] off and you don't know what what's
[46:27] happening around
[46:28] you but there is a spiritual
[46:31] you that does not go to
[46:35] sleep are you together with me so many
[46:38] times the spiritual
[46:41] you expresses
[46:43] himself in
[46:45] dreams amen and these dreams many times
[46:50] reflect our spiritual
[46:53] conditions that's the spiritual you
[46:57] does not sleep at
[46:59] all from the day was
[47:02] born to the day dies he never sleeps but
[47:07] there is a natural you that always goes
[47:10] to
[47:10] sleep so if your condition is all
[47:15] seen that's what you desire there is no
[47:19] way your inner man can touch a spirit
[47:24] world he cannot dream spiritual
[47:28] dreams he cannot dream going to
[47:31] heaven cannot dream having a spiritual
[47:36] service the dreams that he will have are
[47:40] the reflections of what his condition
[47:44] is are you together with me he love
[47:48] dreams when he's in a
[47:51] disco he have a dream when he's fighting
[47:55] he have a dream
[47:57] when is stilling are you together with
[48:00] me so therefore we need to keep our mind
[48:06] clear in order to keep in contact
[48:10] with are you together with me you keep
[48:13] your mind
[48:15] clear if anything passes your
[48:18] mind which you really see is not
[48:21] scripture you clean it under the
[48:25] blood and you father I want my inner man
[48:29] to be intact and
[48:32] clean are you together with me you don't
[48:35] allow the inner man to become
[48:39] negative every time you are just
[48:43] negative when we say this you turn to
[48:46] this when they say church is this you
[48:50] will say no when we say we are going to
[48:52] do this this is such a man
[48:56] get in contact with
[48:59] God and if you are a true
[49:02] Christian and you persistently dream
[49:07] evil then it's time for you to go to God
[49:11] In
[49:12] Prayer because your inner man is warning
[49:15] you about the
[49:18] future okay so that means your inner man
[49:21] is sensing
[49:24] danger in your spiritual work
[49:28] so a fact that all
[49:31] humanity is influenced by
[49:35] Spirit whether man is
[49:37] spiritual or is not spiritual he is
[49:40] influenced by a
[49:42] spiritual brother Bram says
[49:48] M amen influence for man outside
[49:53] world I should understand by the grace
[49:56] of
[49:58] God I deal with the
[50:03] spirits are you together with me so
[50:06] brother Bram now puts a principle
[50:10] here that whether this man is a
[50:13] witch or he's a murderer or he's a
[50:16] robber he's influenced by an outside
[50:20] world and if this man is a
[50:23] Christian he fears God he desires to
[50:26] grow spiritually he is also influenced
[50:29] by another
[50:31] world so they are two different
[50:33] world that control
[50:36] Humanity we are here but we don't
[50:39] control
[50:41] ourselves so if a man becomes so
[50:45] contr that he does things that you don't
[50:49] understand you don't fight him because
[50:52] you know that man is influenced by an
[50:56] outside world
[50:58] we wrestle not with flesh and
[51:00] blood are you together with me but we
[51:03] wrestle with the
[51:05] spirits from man Unseen World you don't
[51:09] need to ask a man who criticizes
[51:13] you because you know what world you are
[51:15] dealing
[51:17] with brother Bram says I understand I
[51:21] deal with the
[51:24] spirit and then he says here again
[51:27] you cannot be here a spiritual
[51:31] being s or
[51:34] Saint without having an
[51:36] influence from under
[51:39] world or from the above
[51:43] World
[51:47] [Music]
[51:48] Saint Saint from above those are the two
[51:53] influences so we are here the two World
[51:57] P upon
[52:02] us okay that's why when one deals with
[52:07] people you must
[52:10] know what kind of spirits you are
[52:12] dealing
[52:13] with we are all operated by a
[52:18] spiritual
[52:20] negative POS there is a spirit world
[52:24] that controls you
[52:28] so again in another message it
[52:31] says now in my work for my
[52:37] master I deal with Spirits all
[52:42] together nothing
[52:44] natural it is all together
[52:48] Spirits if you understand that you are
[52:52] going to live as a free Christian
[52:56] whatever Rises against
[52:59] you you know you are dealing with the
[53:03] spirit whether it's a man you are
[53:06] dealing with the
[53:08] spirit are you together with me you are
[53:11] just dealing with the
[53:12] spirit when you are dealing with a
[53:15] brother you are supposed to be dealing
[53:17] with the Holy
[53:19] Spirit you understand what I mean if you
[53:23] dealing with a non
[53:24] Christian then you know
[53:27] you are dealing with
[53:29] world and you must always put a
[53:35] distance he says you take a good
[53:39] man and let him marry a bad
[53:43] woman that woman will either become a
[53:46] good
[53:47] woman or he'll become a bad
[53:52] man
[53:53] Spirit that's my life I deal with the
[53:57] spirit I don't look at the person I
[54:01] catch him by his
[54:05] spirit amen that's how brother Bram
[54:08] dealt with
[54:10] people just by looking at
[54:13] them talking to them hearing their words
[54:18] putting them back into the
[54:20] words and then you begin to
[54:23] discern so brother Bram would say
[54:26] I'm talking to you a little bit so that
[54:29] I can be able to catch your
[54:32] SP you can never hide what you
[54:37] are to a man who has the
[54:40] word and to a man who is Holy
[54:43] Ghost you can never hide what you
[54:48] are your life is an expression of a
[54:51] spirit
[54:52] world and understanding you
[54:56] as one to go beyond what he can
[55:01] see amen and also beyond what he can
[55:06] hear together with me yes sir so to link
[55:11] to the spirit
[55:13] world one must somehow go beyond the
[55:17] five human
[55:21] senses and then you enter into a channel
[55:26] amen and that channel here is the fourth
[55:32] dimension which we either call
[55:35] Faith which in the stud we are calling a
[55:40] channel is what brings you from the
[55:42] natural
[55:44] world to the spirit world that's the
[55:47] fourth dimension is in between the
[55:53] dimensions so we need the B of the the
[55:56] Holy
[55:57] Ghost to understand
[56:00] people if you don't have the B of the
[56:03] Holy
[56:04] Ghost you can never understand
[56:07] people they can take you for a
[56:11] right they can cause the church to knock
[56:15] heads because you are dealing with them
[56:19] kind but brother Bram tells us he deals
[56:24] with his spirits
[56:26] and that's what we must learn to deal
[56:30] with amen so
[56:33] everybody is an operation center of a
[56:36] spirit
[56:40] world because both God and
[56:44] Satan must be
[56:48] embodied before they operate in this
[56:51] world so then we can ask what embodiment
[56:55] are you
[57:00] because God must use a
[57:04] man and Satan must use the man so there
[57:09] must be an
[57:11] embodiment for a man to operate in this
[57:17] world okay so the Holy Ghost now helps
[57:23] us to associate as an angoy
[57:29] Fellowship hallelujah hallelujah because
[57:31] how was supposed to be an angel
[57:36] fellow he helps
[57:39] my to contact
[57:42] your it's a Divine
[57:45] Fellowship when we talk we are actually
[57:48] dealing with a level higher than
[57:52] Humanity hallelujah hallelujah you are
[57:55] allowing
[57:56] God the nature of God
[58:00] himself that he
[58:02] created from before I mean when he
[58:05] created man he created a gene
[58:11] cell he was a spirit
[58:14] man and placed him in a
[58:17] body so our
[58:20] fellowship is not flesh to
[58:23] flesh hence forth know we no man after
[58:25] the
[58:28] our
[58:31] fellowship touching
[58:41] bestow a Divine
[58:43] Fellowship to relate by the seed gen of
[58:48] life and once you have being a by
[58:52] grace to enter into that spot of life
[58:57] then you benefit from the fruits of un
[58:59] Angelic
[59:02] W amen if you are
[59:06] gifted then Visions can
[59:08] come the word of wisdom can
[59:11] come the word of knowledge can come
[59:15] because you are now
[59:17] communicating with an Angelic
[59:19] world you can
[59:21] speak and things can be you can lay
[59:25] hands on the
[59:27] SE and they can receive their healing
[59:30] are you together with me because it's
[59:33] not this it's the inner man
[59:37] there that we must live
[59:41] back and that's why we come to church so
[59:45] that we may break out of
[59:48] this and standing that
[59:51] channel as a spirit anointed men
[59:56] and when you stand in that chel to enter
[59:59] into the spirit world you end up in the
[1:00:02] seventh
[1:00:05] Dimension where you can say like
[1:00:08] Daniel and I
[1:00:10] saw and I heard amen so you may not see
[1:00:15] natural but there can come an
[1:00:17] inspiration of the
[1:00:20] world that's why when I preach here
[1:00:24] somebody comes to you
[1:00:26] and says Pastor these were the things I
[1:00:29] was meditating
[1:00:31] on Amen you were touching a spirit
[1:00:36] world are you together with me yeah
[1:00:39] because you are trying to prepare
[1:00:42] yourself to me to the Lord You Lord I do
[1:00:47] not know when you come and as you begin
[1:00:51] to meditate like that Heavenly things
[1:00:56] begin to break
[1:01:01] down but if you are complet
[1:01:05] inhabit by spirits of
[1:01:09] negativity I don't know what will happen
[1:01:11] to that
[1:01:14] man but God God God my God my
[1:01:19] God you are
[1:01:21] cursing but you want to you to hear from
[1:01:24] God
[1:01:26] you are getting into that
[1:01:28] channel in a very s
[1:01:32] ground because once you go
[1:01:35] further then your
[1:01:37] communication will be from
[1:01:42] hell I even got a
[1:01:45] vision when he has even died in an
[1:01:52] accident you see what I mean so I'm
[1:01:56] dealing with social
[1:02:00] media and the fourth
[1:02:03] dimension so let us look at a prophet
[1:02:08] here you know brother Bram one time he
[1:02:13] was saying
[1:02:14] oh maybe when I get out of this
[1:02:18] body and we get in heaven there maybe
[1:02:22] I'll just be a
[1:02:24] spirit just flying
[1:02:27] somewhere and I say hello
[1:02:30] Papa you know maybe what am I you know
[1:02:34] so God says would you want to experience
[1:02:37] this are you seeing now where it starts
[1:02:40] from from True
[1:02:43] meditation amen you know when something
[1:02:46] is happening then God begins to take him
[1:02:49] up he says he says I would like that
[1:02:53] very
[1:02:54] much then he went out out of his body to
[1:02:58] be on the C of
[1:03:00] time then he came back to
[1:03:05] tell so what are your
[1:03:10] meditations how do you live your
[1:03:17] day trying to wish them
[1:03:20] evil you are now sliding into fourth
[1:03:23] dimension
[1:03:26] but in a very SLE
[1:03:32] man talk about Visions you can get
[1:03:37] them but from where because the fourth
[1:03:41] dimension it's just a
[1:03:45] channel praise the Lord so let us look
[1:03:49] at a prophet
[1:03:50] here a prophet is a special
[1:03:53] man he lives between natural and
[1:03:56] Supernatural
[1:03:59] World he's always stationed in that
[1:04:03] channel amen is natural here but easily
[1:04:08] falls into the supernatural
[1:04:12] World brother Bram says now I see your
[1:04:20] Visions his
[1:04:22] subconscious is not far from him
[1:04:26] he doesn't go to
[1:04:28] sleep he just breaks from from one
[1:04:31] conscious to
[1:04:35] another amen sometimes me I have to go
[1:04:39] to sleep and then I get a spiritual
[1:04:43] dream but not a prophet he lives between
[1:04:47] these two
[1:04:49] worlds so beyond the five
[1:04:52] senses one steps into the fourth
[1:04:55] dimension
[1:04:58] before he can get into spiritual
[1:05:01] world but the prophet is permanently
[1:05:04] living in that
[1:05:07] channel so the fourth
[1:05:09] dimension is the
[1:05:11] channel brother Bram called it
[1:05:15] Faith amen he also called it the
[1:05:20] super and he called it also the
[1:05:24] six because the natural man has five
[1:05:28] natural
[1:05:30] senses testing saring
[1:05:38] see are you together with me but then
[1:05:42] there is a 6
[1:05:45] sense that's now that
[1:05:47] channel brother Bram called it
[1:05:50] Fai amen then he call it a super
[1:05:56] because it's a
[1:05:57] sense above the
[1:06:00] five amen it connects you to a spirit
[1:06:04] worldall and then he calls it also the
[1:06:07] six
[1:06:09] sense because it's extra from the five
[1:06:13] natural
[1:06:15] senses but then the elected inner
[1:06:20] man amen you always will have that super
[1:06:25] sense
[1:06:28] which is called
[1:06:31] Faith hallelujah hallelujah listen to
[1:06:34] what the prophet say in the message of
[1:06:38] super and the
[1:06:41] super is the Holy Spirit the faith of
[1:06:45] God that dwells in you that's the
[1:06:52] super and you let the five senses Bei
[1:06:56] the
[1:07:05] six that's where the scripture says we
[1:07:09] don't walk by
[1:07:11] sight but we walk by
[1:07:14] faith by allowing our five
[1:07:18] senses to submit to the Super
[1:07:23] S amen it to guide
[1:07:26] you and bring all the other five senses
[1:07:29] under
[1:07:32] control of that
[1:07:34] super for it is so far above
[1:07:40] Naturals as the spiritual man is above a
[1:07:44] natural
[1:07:47] man it is
[1:07:49] far and high as the heaven is above the
[1:07:53] natural man
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:58] these five
[1:07:59] senses it makes you believe
[1:08:02] things that you cannot see it makes you
[1:08:07] act where you do not think the five
[1:08:10] senses would ever think
[1:08:14] about the devil can get into these five
[1:08:18] senses and light you but he cannot touch
[1:08:22] the super
[1:08:25] that's far beyond his
[1:08:29] reach that's why Paul says I has not
[1:08:34] seen and ears have not
[1:08:36] heard what God has
[1:08:41] prepared come on
[1:08:44] now you see where I'm coming from but
[1:08:47] this faith is a channel because it
[1:08:52] doesn't stop at itself
[1:08:57] it guides
[1:08:58] you into another
[1:09:03] dimension it is a
[1:09:05] dimension which science has already
[1:09:08] tapped
[1:09:10] into by
[1:09:12] radio and
[1:09:16] TV TV can be in
[1:09:20] America and bring you the
[1:09:24] visions of what is happening in the
[1:09:26] United States of
[1:09:29] America right now can go to the
[1:09:33] Battleground in Israel and bring to you
[1:09:37] the
[1:09:38] images as they are happening out there
[1:09:42] that's how the prophets lived their
[1:09:46] lives that's what Daniel
[1:09:49] said and I saw and eel and I heard his
[1:09:56] voices and
[1:10:00] images okay so brother
[1:10:04] Bram back and forth he Zed into that
[1:10:09] channel by stepping away from his act
[1:10:13] active
[1:10:15] self amen you know you would say let
[1:10:19] William Bram get out of the
[1:10:22] way and then he would step into the
[1:10:26] Super and then you would say you are not
[1:10:29] from
[1:10:29] here you came from a far country it's a
[1:10:33] mountaineous country you are from
[1:10:36] Tennessee your name is so and so that's
[1:10:39] not five
[1:10:43] censes the super
[1:10:45] sense has opened the
[1:10:48] channel and he seeing you like he would
[1:10:52] see a TV
[1:10:55] the way you could break into
[1:11:00] communication with the supernatural
[1:11:03] world not everybody has got that
[1:11:07] ability but yet at the same time God
[1:11:11] would allow you to enter into
[1:11:14] Dimension and then you begin receiving
[1:11:18] some
[1:11:21] inspiration and then he start saying yes
[1:11:25] yeah I know I'll ask the
[1:11:29] pastor and when you ask the pastor he
[1:11:33] ask you how did you get to thinking that
[1:11:41] way like that but you were going through
[1:11:43] a
[1:11:45] channel are you together with me yeah so
[1:11:49] many times God has allowed you to come
[1:11:52] through that channel
[1:11:55] and then you come back with
[1:11:58] blessings and you say I just even didn't
[1:12:01] know how I overcame this
[1:12:06] temptation but you opened up into
[1:12:10] Channel anointing and power came
[1:12:13] down to support you in
[1:12:17] battle amen so how does the fourth
[1:12:21] dimension
[1:12:24] operate let's go
[1:12:26] now back to the scripture we read Daniel
[1:12:31] 8
[1:12:38] verse
[1:12:41] that's just you begin to
[1:12:44] see science stopped into
[1:12:46] it eel
[1:12:49] 32 then the spirit took me
[1:12:53] up and I had behind
[1:12:56] me a
[1:12:59] voice
[1:13:01] images and
[1:13:03] voices
[1:13:05] prophets easily get into that fourth
[1:13:10] dimension and they say
[1:13:13] things and those things which they say
[1:13:16] the natural man who has not been to that
[1:13:20] Dimension can break himself over those
[1:13:26] us a son is
[1:13:29] born and then a man who is spirit I mean
[1:13:33] and
[1:13:35] intellect but these men here they think
[1:13:39] we don't have
[1:13:41] brain you know what Isaiah
[1:13:45] says the son is born I asked him where
[1:13:48] is he and he says I don't know he thinks
[1:13:53] we are going to be led by that stuff
[1:14:00] you know a fourth
[1:14:03] dimension can only be understood by
[1:14:08] spiritual are you together with me yeah
[1:14:11] it's only that you see you cannot really
[1:14:15] get into it and
[1:14:17] understand they live the state of
[1:14:22] Consecration and that's why the easily
[1:14:25] touch a superatural
[1:14:29] now you have to learn to spare some
[1:14:33] time in the morning as we send the
[1:14:40] exultations just 10
[1:14:42] minutes listen to the
[1:14:44] scripture and be able to be part of that
[1:14:48] prayer and take something and meditate
[1:14:51] for the day
[1:14:55] going to see things begin to change in
[1:14:57] your
[1:14:58] life in the evening you take some
[1:15:02] meditation to you with you to
[1:15:05] B and see what God is going to
[1:15:09] start the shepher is just helping
[1:15:12] you to get into that
[1:15:17] channel amen you see you just need to
[1:15:21] have something to take you there
[1:15:25] brother Bram had something to take him
[1:15:28] there he started
[1:15:31] meditating and then God opens the
[1:15:34] channel what do you meditate
[1:15:36] on many times your
[1:15:40] meditation Bobby wine all movement
[1:15:47] politics bed very
[1:15:49] grief because has been
[1:15:52] beat that kind of medit
[1:15:56] open up
[1:16:01] super have something
[1:16:04] spiritual that's the
[1:16:06] channel because you are going to
[1:16:09] sleep and you'll end up if you are
[1:16:11] married you kick your wife in the
[1:16:15] bed because you were in a
[1:16:17] channel and you are seeing either
[1:16:20] somebody calling a
[1:16:27] my husband the man is
[1:16:35] in he has entered into
[1:16:38] Channel he's a different
[1:16:42] control let us get into the CH of the
[1:16:46] word amen amen
[1:16:50] sacrifice let God see your commitment
[1:16:55] okay if you are not able to make it on
[1:16:57] church
[1:16:59] church but is it
[1:17:02] genuine all you just want relax back
[1:17:06] home and you are watching I
[1:17:13] love that was the days of brother
[1:17:15] brother it was there and it was always
[1:17:19] timing the Wednesday night
[1:17:25] that's the time they would put in that
[1:17:29] soap uh uhuh you know you come
[1:17:37] late you cannot enter into that Channel
[1:17:41] with that kind of a
[1:17:43] li you need to be
[1:17:47] committed amen so prophets easily enter
[1:17:53] there because they spend their
[1:17:56] time meditating and
[1:17:59] consecrating they always in a
[1:18:03] presence so I want to say now that
[1:18:07] getting into the fourth
[1:18:09] chap is the desire of
[1:18:13] everybody and some of the people who
[1:18:16] want to get into that
[1:18:18] channel so that they can come
[1:18:20] back with enough power to pray for the
[1:18:24] sick
[1:18:26] that's what they want to go
[1:18:29] there you remember
[1:18:31] Simon the S he says I'll give you some
[1:18:36] money if you lay your hands on me and
[1:18:40] then I can enter into the channel and
[1:18:43] whoever lay
[1:18:44] hand is going to be
[1:18:48] well that's what Pentecost is all
[1:18:51] about it's about power
[1:18:55] but you should be about
[1:18:58] Consecration and allowing God to use you
[1:19:02] the way he
[1:19:06] chooses
[1:19:08] amen so many of us must be
[1:19:12] careful tampering with the spirit
[1:19:17] world if you are not F to live up
[1:19:20] there you'll spiritually shut
[1:19:27] I was talking with a
[1:19:30] brother and I told him a church is the
[1:19:34] fruit of a
[1:19:38] Ministry if you get the man
[1:19:42] away by throwing him
[1:19:44] out it doesn't matter watch what happens
[1:19:49] to
[1:19:51] the you see people think
[1:20:00] but
[1:20:02] godis for a season and for a
[1:20:07] place amen amen so let's talk a little
[1:20:12] bit now we see the
[1:20:16] channel let's talk about the social
[1:20:21] media now the social media
[1:20:25] it hangs in the fourth
[1:20:28] dimension his
[1:20:30] images and voices and mostly
[1:20:34] communication from a spirit
[1:20:39] world so the fourth
[1:20:42] dimension which is a contact
[1:20:45] Dimension we launch a man into the
[1:20:50] spiritual for the
[1:20:53] believer he launches into the seventh
[1:20:57] Dimension if he's not a prophet he will
[1:21:01] not see
[1:21:02] visits if he's not a prophet he will not
[1:21:05] hear voices if he's not a prophet he
[1:21:09] will receive spiritual
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:13] inspiration over different matters of
[1:21:16] his
[1:21:18] life God will open the word to
[1:21:22] him he's always in contact with the
[1:21:25] spirit
[1:21:27] world are you together with me but for
[1:21:32] prophets it images and
[1:21:35] voices now I want to say this no man
[1:21:40] stands to
[1:21:42] preach without touching the spirit world
[1:21:50] first are you together with me no man
[1:21:53] stands
[1:21:55] to preach without first of all touching
[1:21:59] the
[1:22:01] spirit whether a
[1:22:03] cardinal or he a bishop it doesn't
[1:22:08] matter who he is he must first of all
[1:22:11] get into contact with
[1:22:14] the the first thing
[1:22:17] therefore when a man stands out to
[1:22:20] preach where does he want to take us
[1:22:27] that should be the
[1:22:29] question amen there is Noh man will
[1:22:33] produce clean
[1:22:35] water for the people when he enters into
[1:22:39] that
[1:22:40] channel when he has got
[1:22:42] hate and
[1:22:46] competition when he comes out everything
[1:22:50] that will come out of
[1:22:52] you is going to be a refle
[1:23:01] so the fourth
[1:23:02] dimension is a faith gate for the
[1:23:06] believer to link him into fellowship
[1:23:09] with
[1:23:11] God but the same
[1:23:13] Dimension is an open gate to the mind of
[1:23:18] Lucifer for the unsanctified
[1:23:21] vessel that enters into that channel
[1:23:27] so and
[1:23:30] today especially the young
[1:23:33] people we've got what they call yoga
[1:23:39] meditations yoga meditations
[1:23:42] yog
[1:23:45] yog
[1:23:52] okay you see you know they are teaching
[1:23:56] people how to enter into a spirit
[1:23:59] world and discover
[1:24:04] themselves they tell you enter just
[1:24:09] meditate they teaching people how to
[1:24:12] touch the fourth
[1:24:14] dimension enter into the spirit world
[1:24:17] and discover
[1:24:20] themselves these
[1:24:22] meditations are deser trying to push
[1:24:26] you into a heightened state of
[1:24:32] Consecration and drop you into relaxed
[1:24:37] state in the you know inner
[1:24:41] awareness it is designed
[1:24:44] method to lead you into a
[1:24:48] channel and the
[1:24:50] station is The Fifth Dimension
[1:24:54] they are B of
[1:24:57] Satan and most of the young
[1:25:00] ladies are yoger
[1:25:05] now they do a lot of
[1:25:10] yoga they
[1:25:12] KN they
[1:25:14] wait for quite a number of
[1:25:17] time until they start
[1:25:19] thinking that they are special that they
[1:25:23] are super people
[1:25:25] that they are this and they
[1:25:33] enter you know it's a designed
[1:25:37] method to lead the people into the depth
[1:25:41] of
[1:25:43] Satan area
[1:25:46] which now we've got a
[1:25:50] wichual some are genuine
[1:25:54] and some are not
[1:25:58] genuine but the real
[1:26:01] wit touches a
[1:26:04] dimension okay a real which goes into
[1:26:07] this
[1:26:09] Dimension and then steps into The Fifth
[1:26:13] Dimension and sees
[1:26:16] vision and he says you live in such and
[1:26:19] such a
[1:26:21] place and there is a place like this
[1:26:24] You've Got A Friend Of Yours he lives in
[1:26:28] such and such a
[1:26:32] place he's in a
[1:26:36] dimension brother Bram speaks of Miss
[1:26:40] Piper
[1:26:44] misser you know she was a
[1:26:47] witch and brother Bram says now she's a
[1:26:52] genuine witch
[1:26:56] now there is a real
[1:26:58] one and there is somebody
[1:27:03] impersonating he says Miss Piper was a
[1:27:06] real
[1:27:08] witch she was just an ordinary
[1:27:13] housewi and she fell into TR one
[1:27:17] day while in
[1:27:20] suffering and she began to speak to the
[1:27:23] Dead
[1:27:27] she touched a
[1:27:29] dimension and that's what brother Bram
[1:27:32] is calling a
[1:27:36] trans and she began talking to the
[1:27:39] dead so people get into those
[1:27:44] transes and draw from a
[1:27:47] dimension they come from those
[1:27:50] Dimensions with designs
[1:27:56] some
[1:27:57] Fashions and some kind of a way of
[1:28:01] look and the world today is designed by
[1:28:06] a spirit
[1:28:11] world the devil knows how to design the
[1:28:16] women it's not a good thinking
[1:28:20] person who thinks about this kind of
[1:28:23] design
[1:28:26] there are these dresses
[1:28:28] here which are tight
[1:28:30] here and they are very wide around
[1:28:34] here and now one time you are walking
[1:28:38] the wind just
[1:28:41] come that's what they want the devil
[1:28:44] designed them for
[1:28:49] that you know these designs and fashions
[1:28:54] they don't come from a right thinking
[1:28:58] person it's a person going
[1:29:04] somewhere he has been to a
[1:29:08] dimension Miss
[1:29:12] Piper so one time brother Bram saw that
[1:29:18] Dimension and then he saw it in a vision
[1:29:24] but then 40 years
[1:29:27] later he went to escort his wife for
[1:29:33] shopping thec pen
[1:29:39] store and you know while he was there
[1:29:43] his wife started going
[1:29:46] shopping you know when you go with your
[1:29:48] wife
[1:29:50] shopping you need to be
[1:29:52] patient you suff
[1:29:57] along you know because they look I think
[1:30:00] at this car po five times read all the
[1:30:04] notes then put that one down then get
[1:30:07] this one here look at it then sniff it a
[1:30:12] little
[1:30:13] bit she even call
[1:30:16] you which one do you think is better
[1:30:24] they always like
[1:30:26] shopping for the men you just want to go
[1:30:28] in the shop and get
[1:30:32] out so brother Bram excused
[1:30:35] himself and he sat outside
[1:30:38] somewhere at the end of a
[1:30:42] conveyor you know the conveyor keeps
[1:30:44] taking the
[1:30:46] people so he started
[1:30:49] watching watching these ones these ones
[1:30:52] come then he says
[1:30:54] I really turned sick at my
[1:30:58] stomach seeing these women come up
[1:31:01] there
[1:31:03] young old
[1:31:06] indifferent
[1:31:09] wrinkled and everywhere with little bit
[1:31:13] shorts
[1:31:14] on they are F body and those sexy
[1:31:18] dressed women with those great big heads
[1:31:21] like that and and here they
[1:31:27] come and one of them coming
[1:31:29] up was a Spanish
[1:31:32] speaking to another woman she was a
[1:31:36] white woman speaking to the Spanish
[1:31:41] woman and then I looked brother Bram
[1:31:44] stops a
[1:31:46] finger all at
[1:31:48] once I was
[1:31:51] changed they I had seen that before
[1:31:55] before I had seen that one
[1:31:59] before then he says painting their
[1:32:03] eyes just recent like a
[1:32:07] cut you know put put it up like this and
[1:32:11] wearing cut glasses and
[1:32:15] everything and that brings stuff under
[1:32:18] their
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:20] eyes there was that thing
[1:32:24] that I had
[1:32:25] seen when I was a
[1:32:28] child there was a woman just
[1:32:32] exactly and I just got num all
[1:32:38] over and began to look
[1:32:41] around
[1:32:42] looked like that just changed for a
[1:32:47] moment and I looked and I thought that
[1:32:51] is what I saw in Hell
[1:32:55] there they
[1:32:57] was that
[1:32:59] coner I thought because they were in
[1:33:03] Hell is What made them look that way a
[1:33:07] green blue under their eyes and there
[1:33:10] was these women painted with greenish
[1:33:13] blue just the way that Vision said about
[1:33:16] 40 years
[1:33:22] ago they were right
[1:33:24] there he saw them in a
[1:33:28] vision because when he was 14
[1:33:31] years he was
[1:33:33] hunting and he got a gun
[1:33:37] accident and then he was taken to
[1:33:40] hospital he was bleeding to death so he
[1:33:44] got into some kind of a
[1:33:45] vision he was not born again yeah so he
[1:33:50] started going down down down
[1:33:55] and he was falling
[1:33:58] bottomless and then he started getting
[1:34:00] to
[1:34:01] people that were
[1:34:05] gr and they were
[1:34:08] there he looked and he says God if you
[1:34:12] get me out of here I'll will serve you
[1:34:15] all the days of my
[1:34:20] life and down there is where he had seen
[1:34:25] those uh uh
[1:34:27] women they were painted in such a
[1:34:30] way and thought being in
[1:34:34] Hell is What made them that
[1:34:36] way but that Vision waited and came
[1:34:42] out 40 years
[1:34:44] later many of these
[1:34:47] makeups
[1:34:49] make they are just Fashions from hell
[1:34:54] all these kind of
[1:34:57] ises Amen they put out fish
[1:35:01] ones and you begin to part your eyes
[1:35:03] like a
[1:35:06] cut those are fions from
[1:35:09] hell those Spirits just come
[1:35:12] up and it comes to a season and they are
[1:35:17] popularized by the social
[1:35:22] media we have got a very big
[1:35:26] problem with the social
[1:35:28] media you do one thing overnight you are
[1:35:31] a
[1:35:35] celebrity but men who became
[1:35:39] famous in the
[1:35:42] 1960s those were real
[1:35:45] men
[1:35:47] Sportsmen like a
[1:35:49] p you know until they became famous the
[1:35:52] world over
[1:35:56] the story from one man to another to
[1:35:58] another another
[1:36:00] another social media one night you are a
[1:36:06] celebrity we are in
[1:36:09] trouble a woman picks up a fashion from
[1:36:14] hell and just goes as an act in a
[1:36:19] film you stand on the
[1:36:21] street one week later
[1:36:24] you see the
[1:36:30] fashion and I really
[1:36:32] wonder
[1:36:34] ladies you know those women who put on
[1:36:36] those high
[1:36:39] heel many of them when they are driving
[1:36:43] their
[1:36:44] cars they don't have those high heels do
[1:36:48] you know that they have driving shoes
[1:36:52] inside these shoes here are walking to
[1:36:55] the
[1:36:56] supermarket and then back to the
[1:36:59] car but poor
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:08] girls we are in
[1:37:11] trouble why don't we repent from
[1:37:14] that those are designs from
[1:37:20] hell they suffer the world
[1:37:24] there is nothing as
[1:37:26] stable as a young woman is thirsting for
[1:37:34] f we'll
[1:37:37] stand and then we'll
[1:37:39] try why I dying what I dying
[1:37:46] for God have
[1:37:51] mercy praise the Lord these souls in
[1:37:56] Hell put on
[1:37:58] bodies and they come forth with
[1:38:03] attitudes and ways of
[1:38:05] life and they begin to stay in the
[1:38:12] community and then the social
[1:38:20] media are you together with me
[1:38:24] some of them are very mean
[1:38:37] men he begins to do
[1:38:40] this and then you just wait for a few
[1:38:43] weeks
[1:38:54] they are
[1:38:57] matchs spirits put on
[1:39:01] bodies and they
[1:39:04] Negative they start using some
[1:39:08] terminologies and now some of the young
[1:39:11] people even said those words not knowing
[1:39:15] what they
[1:39:20] mean this man the spirits
[1:39:25] they come and embody the
[1:39:27] people they become
[1:39:31] unteachable you point them to this they
[1:39:34] will point to
[1:39:36] that
[1:39:38] wild and Desiring to spread their
[1:39:43] anointing amen you can never change them
[1:39:47] because they can never be
[1:39:49] reborn they are not Eternal seeds
[1:39:55] amen they proceed from The Fifth
[1:39:59] Dimension and Inspire fashion
[1:40:04] designers they pop up through the fourth
[1:40:09] dimension as
[1:40:11] designers musicians and film
[1:40:16] actors and they come up with certain
[1:40:19] words they sing words you don't
[1:40:22] understand
[1:40:24] you can never find them in any
[1:40:26] language you cannot search them
[1:40:30] in are spirits and as the people keep
[1:40:34] singing those things they are trying to
[1:40:37] invite those spirits to
[1:40:41] themselves you look at men like
[1:40:46] Hitler H man those were SS from hell
[1:40:53] amen no man could convert a
[1:40:58] devil the best you can make out of him
[1:41:02] is to make him a religious
[1:41:04] man he will not smoke he will not drink
[1:41:08] he will not not go to the next Club but
[1:41:11] even in the church is not going to be a
[1:41:14] St soul
[1:41:16] [Music]
[1:41:23] are you together with me never spend
[1:41:26] your good time meditating on something
[1:41:29] that's not the
[1:41:31] word it will launch you into a
[1:41:36] dimension so TV is a
[1:41:39] dimension like the tree of Good and
[1:41:43] Evil are you together with me the tree
[1:41:47] was there of knowing good and evil but
[1:41:51] God had given Adam and
[1:41:54] the tree of good but there was this
[1:41:57] other tree know good and evil and once
[1:42:01] they touched that tree they had no
[1:42:04] control over the evil which they
[1:42:09] discovered be
[1:42:11] careful when you are dealing with the
[1:42:13] social
[1:42:17] media Amen in the days of brother
[1:42:21] Bram it was a te
[1:42:24] program which was so
[1:42:27] popular I love
[1:42:29] Su but today is Premier League
[1:42:38] matches me at home and I
[1:42:41] sleep you see
[1:42:45] the and church we
[1:42:48] going I'm telling you that's why young
[1:42:51] men don't don't really encourage
[1:42:55] themselves with
[1:43:00] midweek did you hear what I
[1:43:04] said TV
[1:43:07] now runs on our
[1:43:11] computers which we have in our home they
[1:43:14] run on our
[1:43:16] phones it is an evil which we carry in
[1:43:20] our
[1:43:21] pockets we are
[1:43:23] potentially connected to the negative
[1:43:26] fourth
[1:43:31] dimension where brother Bram
[1:43:35] lamented that Satan has put TVs in our
[1:43:39] houses he has now decreased them in size
[1:43:43] and he has put them in our
[1:43:49] pocket are you together with me I have
[1:43:52] my
[1:43:55] but they are like the two trees in the
[1:43:59] garden which were fully
[1:44:02] interwin both good and evil in the same
[1:44:07] Dimension it now depends on how you feed
[1:44:10] on
[1:44:12] it you must be
[1:44:15] careful on how you use
[1:44:19] your it opens into a channel you cannot
[1:44:25] some young men are totally hooked up to
[1:44:28] pornography because of
[1:44:31] those a channel that is too hard for
[1:44:34] them to take
[1:44:37] control when Eve ate of the other tree
[1:44:41] for
[1:44:45] sake the Gate of knowledge was so hard
[1:44:54] it was so hard for her to
[1:44:57] control and she became a
[1:45:01] merchant of that
[1:45:04] Channel the bible says and when the
[1:45:07] woman saw that the tree was good
[1:45:10] for that it was pleas to the eyes and
[1:45:14] Tre to be desired to make one
[1:45:17] wise she took of the fruit
[1:45:20] thereof did E and became a
[1:45:23] merchant also for her husband with her
[1:45:26] and also did
[1:45:29] it and you become a merchant in
[1:45:32] church you are the one who knows the
[1:45:34] best
[1:45:37] so and you say when you see that one you
[1:45:42] will not want to
[1:45:44] stop she's
[1:45:46] tried because that gate is hard to deal
[1:45:49] with
[1:45:54] be
[1:45:55] careful there you are with social
[1:45:59] media it's a dimension
[1:46:02] pool it pours out
[1:46:06] pornography Fashions different modes of
[1:46:10] character it creates suspicion in
[1:46:15] homes everybody's monitoring the
[1:46:19] other it brings down fears and
[1:46:21] instability in family
[1:46:27] in fact researchers are
[1:46:31] found that the more a person examines
[1:46:35] their Partners Facebook
[1:46:45] activity more that person reports
[1:46:48] jealousy and mistress
[1:47:01] with the social
[1:47:03] media man has opened the
[1:47:06] channel which he can never
[1:47:10] control it's tearing
[1:47:12] families it's tearing down juvenile
[1:47:18] morals then comes this artificial
[1:47:21] intelligence
[1:47:24] which has got the capacity to destroy
[1:47:32] Society with arici
[1:47:35] idence a man can make
[1:47:38] me or can make you and make you
[1:47:43] speak even in your own words The Words
[1:47:47] which you've never said
[1:47:53] are you together with me it is going to
[1:47:56] take away people's
[1:48:01] jobs you know those I cannot go into
[1:48:06] that it becomes so hard it's destroying
[1:48:11] Society they break into
[1:48:14] Banks dig
[1:48:16] robberies and millions of dollars are
[1:48:19] transferred from bank accounts
[1:48:25] we are now launching into a driverless
[1:48:29] vehicle
[1:48:33] stage which is cyber
[1:48:37] control it will be the
[1:48:40] age of great
[1:48:45] kidnaps because a man just goes into the
[1:48:49] channel and redirects the computer of
[1:48:52] that
[1:48:56] and it takes you to where you are
[1:48:58] supposed to be
[1:49:01] kidnapped Henry you are the you are the
[1:49:05] chief people
[1:49:08] there isn't that right
[1:49:12] possible you see what I mean so the
[1:49:15] dimension is pouring
[1:49:17] out depression to young
[1:49:21] people and eating away their mental
[1:49:24] brains by
[1:49:28] volumes they don't think like we used to
[1:49:30] think
[1:49:32] anymore social media takes over brain
[1:49:37] cells and affects mental and physical
[1:49:43] health being on social media every
[1:49:47] day every hour and every minute can
[1:49:51] really cause damage
[1:49:53] your
[1:49:59] brain but we are starting our
[1:50:04] children
[1:50:10] time social
[1:50:12] media if
[1:50:16] you who just got to know
[1:50:20] this when you out
[1:50:23] would struggle to close the
[1:50:26] gates how about the children you are
[1:50:29] introducing at five years two
[1:50:35] years brother Bram saw it
[1:50:39] coming and says the lead is off of
[1:50:45] hell
[1:50:47] so and it pours out through the fourth
[1:50:51] dimension to
[1:50:53] people you better take
[1:50:56] refuge under the
[1:50:58] blood otherwise we are not
[1:51:04] say brother Bram
[1:51:06] says and
[1:51:08] brother the lead is of come of of
[1:51:13] hell that's right and streams of demon
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:21] power is in out from
[1:51:24] everywhere is conquered the Nations it's
[1:51:28] conquered
[1:51:29] politics is to
[1:51:33] the conquered the
[1:51:36] churches until they know
[1:51:38] nothing
[1:51:42] denomination he says the leads of
[1:51:46] hell so any mess you make into the
[1:51:50] fourth dimension
[1:51:53] without the lead on your
[1:51:56] soul it pours out Lords of
[1:52:00] spirits like a flood towards
[1:52:04] you amen is pouring out wild

[1:52:46] and
[1:52:47] roll brother Brenham says and the spirit
[1:52:50] is not only in America
[1:52:53] it has spread itself all over the
[1:52:56] world to bring them to the Battle of
[1:53:00] Amad Hallelujah that music has got
[1:53:05] anointing
[1:53:07] behind to lead the people to the
[1:53:13] of

[1:53:18] music they become wild and they can face
[1:53:22] a
[1:53:24] bullet they don't care they anointed and
[1:53:29] preparing
[1:53:32] them effects of social
[1:53:38] media you read about these big rock
[1:53:43] concerts they always end up with
[1:53:49] violence and depression
[1:53:54] comes
[1:53:56] thereafter because you sing about what's
[1:53:59] not
[1:54:00] real you want to touch it but you cannot
[1:54:03] feel
[1:54:05] it we thank God for Christian
[1:54:10] music
[1:54:12] I love him and you feel
[1:54:16] it I love him
[1:54:20] because he first
[1:54:24] love and you say hallelujah hallelujah
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:44] and it is
[1:54:47] relaxing you feel relaxed it's real
[1:54:52] years ago I was with brother Ro rodward
[1:54:57] in
[1:54:58] Germany he's a very good Street
[1:55:01] Preacher he gets his jitar text the
[1:55:04] younger people and then they begin to
[1:55:08] play the people would gather and you
[1:55:11] would tell me stepen now start now I
[1:55:14] would preach I would preach then the
[1:55:17] evening we had tent meetings we would go
[1:55:20] for the tent meeting so one woman had
[1:55:24] seen me in the street and then she told
[1:55:28] me you would be getting people here if
[1:55:32] you were singing better but you people
[1:55:35] you sing like you in a
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:55:40] funeral because they want something
[1:55:44] big you know just no meaning but
[1:55:48] something that's what they want you go
[1:55:51] to a crusade and the things start boom
[1:55:54] boom and
[1:55:55] then nothing has come out no voice no
[1:55:58] nothing just
[1:56:01] boom Rock
[1:56:06] sound and then in the evening when I was
[1:56:09] preaching I preached on watch man what
[1:56:12] of the
[1:56:15] night and I pinned The Edge
[1:56:19] down and this woman came to me
[1:56:23] same woman says human you come from
[1:56:26] Africa I said yes what business do you
[1:56:30] have to come here and tell us what we
[1:56:33] must
[1:56:38] do I tell you you know this age is
[1:56:43] gone they under
[1:56:46] depression they don't want to be told
[1:56:48] they
[1:56:50] are depression is a condition
[1:56:54] a person sinks into just some kind of an
[1:56:59] idiot he sinks into low
[1:57:04] Ms he sees us to participate in
[1:57:08] activities it a resigned
[1:57:12] mode and some of
[1:57:14] them if they in church they hate Church
[1:57:30] the p is on
[1:57:32] theit he's suffering from
[1:57:35] something he a mental
[1:57:40] disorder and in this condition you begin
[1:57:43] to consider yourself
[1:57:46] useless
[1:57:48] insure and in most cases to a case that
[1:57:52] you cannot even
[1:57:55] explain you just see you don't have love
[1:57:58] for
[1:58:00] anybody and today the major cause of
[1:58:04] depression among the young
[1:58:06] people is the social
[1:58:10] media it will cause young people to
[1:58:14] struggle because on the
[1:58:17] post this one is
[1:58:20] eating in a big
[1:58:23] hotel I don't know what is that big
[1:58:26] hotel
[1:58:28] Sera and you know we go to the same
[1:58:32] school but we go to the same
[1:58:35] school but we don't come from the same
[1:58:39] family this is a class for
[1:58:42] Serena but my class here it is
[1:58:49] [Music]
[1:58:50] for so you would like also to sh a
[1:58:53] little
[1:58:54] bit you begin to
[1:58:57] struggle who will take me
[1:59:03] to social
[1:59:06] media it set space in fashion and
[1:59:13] character it has become a handbook
[1:59:18] life when marriages are going wrong
[1:59:22] they don't come to the
[1:59:24] pastor Google
[1:59:27] Google how do I
[1:59:29] handle a wife who is
[1:59:34] ruthless and you'll find anything on
[1:59:39] Google you'll find all kinds of
[1:59:42] advice slap very hard in the
[1:59:49] face and by the time they are starting
[1:59:51] to
[1:59:52] the
[2:00:00] py are you together with me so just like
[2:00:04] a
[2:00:05] cancer brother Bram said
[2:00:07] cancer is a fourth dimension
[2:00:11] disease and even this kind of social
[2:00:15] media it is a fourth dimension disease
[2:00:22] it is Spirit pouring from The Fifth
[2:00:25] Dimension through the Gateway of the
[2:00:27] fourth
[2:00:30] dimension is
[2:00:32] demonology by way of
[2:00:37] Technology amen is two
[2:00:40] trees in the
[2:00:42] channel into the spirit
[2:00:45] world you enter into the
[2:00:48] channel and as you enter into the
[2:00:50] channel
[2:00:52] then there are two
[2:00:53] trees there are two
[2:00:56] highways one tree grows towards
[2:00:59] destruction and the other grows towards
[2:01:03] Harvest heading out towards two
[2:01:06] different
[2:01:08] dimensions so when you enter into the
[2:01:10] fourth
[2:01:12] dimension amen depending on the
[2:01:15] spiritual
[2:01:16] condition you either going to The Fifth
[2:01:20] Dimension and you become a Mrs
[2:01:23] paper all you end up into the seventh
[2:01:27] Dimension the inspiration where
[2:01:34] brother amen am now let me show you
[2:01:37] something here in the Philadelphia
[2:01:41] Church
[2:01:42] age are you still here this
[2:01:44] morning amen so the seventh
[2:01:48] age he says a very short age
[2:01:54] gathers into itself for one quick
[2:01:59] work all the evil of every
[2:02:03] age and yet all the reality of
[2:02:07] pentec everything good and
[2:02:10] bad that started with
[2:02:13] Ephesus amen they gather up into this
[2:02:18] age and the prophet says once the
[2:02:21] philadelph Ed has run out its
[2:02:25] course the Lan Edge quickly comes
[2:02:29] in bringing both the tears and the wheat
[2:02:33] to our
[2:02:36] best so we come into this
[2:02:39] Channel and then you enter into Harvest
[2:02:43] of some
[2:02:46] nature because around the edge of
[2:02:50] reformation is the edge of the open
[2:02:55] door it pours out of the evils of the
[2:02:59] edge and all the beauty of all the
[2:03:03] ages those are the two trees now either
[2:03:07] you lead the falsehood and
[2:03:11] evil and
[2:03:15] living which is the final
[2:03:18] harvest the depth of Satan for the tree
[2:03:22] of knowledge of Good and Evil and yet
[2:03:25] again another
[2:03:27] Branch about the stch of a
[2:03:31] perfect the beauty of Holiness and
[2:03:34] that's what you
[2:03:38] are so there will be a
[2:03:40] people that will stand in this fourth
[2:03:44] dimension the
[2:03:46] channel fully
[2:03:49] Sanctified by the word
[2:03:52] waiting for the Lord to launch them into
[2:03:55] the seventh
[2:03:57] Dimension fellowship with the
[2:04:00] supernatural
[2:04:02] Hallelujah that's where we
[2:04:06] are his Gathering us for
[2:04:09] that you are going to be so
[2:04:12] close to the real
[2:04:15] seed until you start now causing the
[2:04:19] master to come down
[2:04:23] to come and walk in his
[2:04:25] form and then he say yes the crop is
[2:04:30] ready are we ready
[2:04:33] friends yes sir amen you step it the
[2:04:37] fourth
[2:04:38] dimension for a supernatural
[2:04:41] Fellowship father we want to ascend to
[2:04:43] the
[2:04:45] holiest by the blood of
[2:04:48] Jesus Amen brother Bram again says
[2:04:52] we are now Angelic beings associate
[2:05:02] together amen you see because you
[2:05:09] being but in a
[2:05:12] body Hallelujah hallu those are also
[2:05:15] fallen
[2:05:17] angels in
[2:05:19] bodies but we live in the same
[2:05:23] Dimension what separates
[2:05:26] us is what happens in the fourth
[2:05:31] dimension where do you go when you step
[2:05:34] in
[2:05:39] there see Angelic beings associate
[2:05:44] together if you got the holy spirit in
[2:05:47] you then you are candidate for
[2:05:50] Association
[2:05:52] with the Unseen World and the
[2:05:56] Supernatural are you together did you
[2:05:58] hear that let me read it again if you've
[2:06:02] got the Holy Spirit then you are a
[2:06:06] candidate for
[2:06:09] Association and the supernatural how
[2:06:12] many candidates do we have
[2:06:15] here amen so we stand in the CH by A
[2:06:20] Perfect faith
[2:06:23] and this perfect faith is the faith of
[2:06:26] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:06:28] himself this faith is a supernatural
[2:06:32] Faith this channel here this faith is
[2:06:36] the saving faith of Jesus
[2:06:39] Christ this is the faith the prophet
[2:06:42] calls the Living
[2:06:45] Faith this Faith opens the CH for
[2:06:49] fellowship with God
[2:06:51] after your new
[2:06:53] B you go a channel you go
[2:06:57] into and you begin to
[2:06:59] grow there are certain things begin
[2:07:02] falling away and you say yes I
[2:07:06] experience his
[2:07:08] presence brother Bram says now see at
[2:07:13] first the disciples didn't have this
[2:07:17] Faith they didn't have it because they
[2:07:21] they had had
[2:07:23] Christ walking with
[2:07:25] him but then afterwards Christ was in
[2:07:30] them and so you see it's hard then to
[2:07:34] have this perfect faith without the Holy
[2:07:38] Spirit it has to bring
[2:07:41] it so perfect Faith connects the
[2:07:45] believer to the seventh
[2:07:48] Dimension amen so the fourth dimension
[2:07:52] is a and not a
[2:07:59] station it's a channel because it
[2:08:02] doesn't retain
[2:08:05] you it posts you
[2:08:08] on that's
[2:08:10] Fai amen originally let me explain this
[2:08:16] originally there was one
[2:08:20] dimension which is called the seventh
[2:08:23] Dimension where God lived with all the
[2:08:27] Angels but the fall of
[2:08:30] Lucifer God had to create The Fifth
[2:08:34] Dimension because what would he
[2:08:36] do with a
[2:08:38] fellow that has fallen and cannot
[2:08:43] repent he had to send him away from the
[2:08:47] dimension but he had to create him one
[2:08:50] so theth Di di menion of
[2:08:52] hell was created for the devil and his
[2:08:56] angels that's what the scripture says
[2:08:59] brother Bram said hell was created for
[2:09:02] the
[2:09:04] devil and his angels not for human
[2:09:11] beings just turn around and tell the
[2:09:14] brother around
[2:09:16] you hell is not my place
[2:09:24] it was created for the
[2:09:27] devil and his
[2:09:29] angels and then he says but if you go
[2:09:34] it's because you will want to
[2:09:37] go and you can't go
[2:09:44] easy you might must fight your way into
[2:09:49] it did you know that
[2:09:52] you can't go to hell
[2:09:54] EAS you have to fight your way to
[2:09:57] it
[2:10:01] imagine to serve a
[2:10:04] master who
[2:10:07] a from here he TS
[2:10:14] you
[2:10:17] you he torments you here on Earth
[2:10:22] there's no peace to the
[2:10:25] wicked says the Lord makes you an
[2:10:29] alcoholic takes you into
[2:10:31] Brothers those amen robs you of good
[2:10:40] family subjects you tonight
[2:10:43] Club it's not easy to go to
[2:10:47] hell the prophet
[2:10:49] says he still here
[2:10:53] first your
[2:10:55] family your children
[2:10:58] scatter because of
[2:11:01] alcoholism you become a
[2:11:03] wreck going to hell is not as easy as
[2:11:07] you
[2:11:09] think the torment begins
[2:11:14] here when God created
[2:11:18] man he also made man to live in the s
[2:11:21] Dimension with
[2:11:24] him when Man was created in a spirit
[2:11:30] form but then when God needed
[2:11:34] man to the
[2:11:37] Earth that's when he created these three
[2:11:41] dimensions of time light and
[2:11:47] matter okay then that makes five
[2:11:54] Dimensions the original one of
[2:11:56] God where Man was created to
[2:12:01] live and then when the devil
[2:12:04] fell then the fifth was
[2:12:07] created when man was put in the body
[2:12:10] three other dimensions
[2:12:12] come amen and
[2:12:16] still the body of
[2:12:19] Flesh in the body of Flesh
[2:12:22] God still visited man in
[2:12:26] Eden but when Adam
[2:12:29] fell amen and God redeemed
[2:12:33] him he had to
[2:12:36] create a six
[2:12:39] Dimension where when man
[2:12:42] dies he would go
[2:12:46] to before the fullness of redemption is
[2:12:49] come
[2:12:52] so when I pass
[2:12:54] away one of these days after brother
[2:12:58] Nathan from Z he was preaching the week
[2:13:04] before and the following Sunday
[2:13:07] today he's in
[2:13:10] glory who
[2:13:12] knows so when the Lord picks me
[2:13:17] up that's the dimension he takes me to
[2:13:21] the sixth
[2:13:22] Dimension but
[2:13:25] now we know that when sin came in the
[2:13:30] garden it was the
[2:13:33] serpent injecting himself into the human
[2:13:37] race and we got a serpent
[2:13:41] seed growing together with
[2:13:46] Humanity when they die God takes them
[2:13:50] back to
[2:13:52] Hell In The Fifth
[2:13:54] Dimension are you together with me okay
[2:13:58] now let me explain where we are
[2:14:02] now how many of you love
[2:14:07] God how many of you have ever felt that
[2:14:11] presence that you come to a point and
[2:14:15] you really say yes I've come into a
[2:14:18] presence and that presence is so
[2:14:22] when you touch that
[2:14:24] presence you feel like you can even
[2:14:29] melt it's a satisfying
[2:14:32] presence but then you can't explain
[2:14:37] it
[2:14:40] first
[2:14:44] verse after the
[2:14:46] fall God could not come back in the
[2:14:49] garden
[2:14:51] Amen in a physical
[2:14:53] person and talk to Adam and
[2:14:56] Eve so what did God do he created a
[2:15:01] channel the fourth
[2:15:03] dimension to connect you to him by
[2:15:08] faith that's what first Peter 18
[2:15:12] says having not
[2:15:16] seen in though now you seem not
[2:15:22] yet
[2:15:23] believing you rejoice with joy
[2:15:27] unspeakable and full of Glory you don't
[2:15:31] see him but you feel him
[2:15:35] Hallelujah you've stepped in a
[2:15:38] channel the Holy Ghost himself connects
[2:15:41] us into that
[2:15:42] channel but any man that touches that
[2:15:46] channel without the Holy Ghost touches
[2:15:50] the other tree
[2:15:53] he can come out with the true I mean
[2:15:57] with the tree of knowledge
[2:16:03] anointing a religious
[2:16:06] anointing which had having an
[2:16:12] sacrifice but yet with for his
[2:16:17] brethren we don't need to get there like
[2:16:20] that
[2:16:25] are you together with me you are
[2:16:29] called to live in Heavenly
[2:16:31] places with Christ
[2:16:35] Jesus to stay in that
[2:16:38] channel fully
[2:16:41] connected that if God has to
[2:16:44] speak Lord speak here I am I'm
[2:16:49] listening amen amen if he wants to use
[2:16:52] you you are like Isaiah you say send me
[2:16:57] I'm ready that's being in the channel
[2:17:00] and you are
[2:17:03] consecrated is that our desire this
[2:17:06] afternoon amen so our faith places Us in
[2:17:11] Heavenly
[2:17:13] places in channel to continue in
[2:17:17] fellowship with
[2:17:18] Christ in what
[2:17:21] call in Heavenly
[2:17:25] places let's go to Ephesians
[2:17:29] 2:6 I want to describe where we
[2:17:32] are in this present hour as sons of God
[2:17:38] Amen you need to go with the true
[2:17:42] meditation as you walk back home you
[2:17:45] tell the devil I'm in Heavenly places
[2:17:48] now you cannot pull me back
[2:17:51] amen I'm a Child of God you cannot lie
[2:17:55] to me amen and you tell the devil you've
[2:17:59] employed me a long time I have resigned
[2:18:02] your job I cannot be your your your your
[2:18:06] slave
[2:18:08] anymore God has redeemed Me That by the
[2:18:12] blood of his own son now I am a child of
[2:18:16] God I believe what God says about
[2:18:21] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:18:24] yes Ephesians 2 Verse
[2:18:29] 6 the scripture
[2:18:31] says and has raised us up
[2:18:35] together and made us together in
[2:18:38] Heavenly places in Christ
[2:18:43] Jesus not
[2:18:46] will but has raised us up
[2:18:51] are you together with me not
[2:18:54] we is not talking about the I mean the
[2:18:57] natural
[2:18:59] man he's talking about the spirit
[2:19:02] man that may be for 30
[2:19:05] years or for 20 years he was in this I
[2:19:09] mean dead in sin and
[2:19:12] trespass but now he has raised you
[2:19:16] up hallelujah hallelujah to his own
[2:19:19] righteousness
[2:19:21] so there is this
[2:19:23] raising of the seed gen on the
[2:19:26] inside to
[2:19:28] recognition that we are sons of
[2:19:31] God most we are
[2:19:34] confirmed when we receive the spirit of
[2:19:37] adoption so the inner man is a
[2:19:41] level amen Which is higher than the
[2:19:45] natural man in
[2:19:48] phes amen in a man is
[2:19:53] risen is already
[2:19:56] risen in Christ and is seated in
[2:20:01] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and this
[2:20:04] body here is just trying to move into
[2:20:07] that
[2:20:09] motion and when the body also gets that
[2:20:14] condition will be body
[2:20:17] change but right now you are on the
[2:20:21] ins so the inner man is contacting God
[2:20:27] through the CH of
[2:20:29] the into Heavenly places with Christ
[2:20:36] Jesus there is a part of you which is
[2:20:39] not
[2:20:40] natural
[2:20:43] natural Paul's
[2:20:45] description of heavenly places in Christ
[2:20:49] Jesus will help us to understand the
[2:20:54] level that God has placed us
[2:20:56] on when Christ
[2:20:59] came he transferred us from Mount
[2:21:03] Si of the law to Mount
[2:21:07] Zion of Grace is that amen we are not
[2:21:11] under the law anymore you were
[2:21:15] transfer from Mount Si to Mount Zion
[2:21:21] and in this
[2:21:22] transfer Paul relates the Mount
[2:21:26] Zion the Mount of grace to the present
[2:21:30] tense
[2:21:31] Fellowship of the redeemed with Heavenly
[2:21:36] beings Hallelujah there Heavenly places
[2:21:41] in Christ Jesus let's go to Hebrews and
[2:21:44] just look at where Paul says we are
[2:21:48] [Music]
[2:21:51] the fourth
[2:21:53] dimension amen under the channel of the
[2:21:57] social
[2:21:58] media is putting the people into the
[2:22:02] prison of
[2:22:04] hell but for us the fourth channel the
[2:22:08] fourth dimension and the spiritual faith
[2:22:13] is placing Us in Heavenly places in
[2:22:17] Christ Jesus that's where we are Hebrew
[2:22:21] 12 verse
[2:22:23] 18 He says for you are not come unto the
[2:22:26] mount that might for you are not come un
[2:22:31] the mount that might be
[2:22:36] touched and that bur with
[2:22:40] fire no unto Blackness and darkness and
[2:22:45] Tempest and the sound of trumpet
[2:22:50] the voice of
[2:22:52] what which voice they that had ined that
[2:22:56] the word should not be spoken to them
[2:23:03] anymore for they could not endure that
[2:23:06] which was
[2:23:08] commanded and if so much as Beast touch
[2:23:11] the
[2:23:12] mountain it should be stoned or thrust
[2:23:15] through with the D
[2:23:21] and so terrible was the sight that Moses
[2:23:25] said I exceedingly fear and
[2:23:32] [Music]
[2:23:33] quck so this allegory
[2:23:37] here defines the
[2:23:40] Wrath with which law was
[2:23:44] given all
[2:23:46] Israel could not stand before the
[2:23:49] Lord so the nature in which the law
[2:23:53] came had the connotation of judgment
[2:23:56] behind
[2:23:59] it the law is the revealer of
[2:24:03] sin and the judge of
[2:24:06] sin in it was no power to perform the
[2:24:13] law and so it was a terrifying
[2:24:17] sight and Moses said I fear
[2:24:21] greatly Moses feared because he
[2:24:25] understood the nature of
[2:24:27] man that man
[2:24:30] fails but the difference is that the
[2:24:33] next
[2:24:34] Mountain we are
[2:24:37] lifted into
[2:24:39] presence this is where we
[2:24:41] are
[2:24:43] Hallelujah he says in verse
[2:24:46] 22 but you are come to m
[2:24:50] the city of the Living God the heavenly
[2:24:55] Jerusalem
[2:24:57] inable to the general
[2:25:00] assembly and the Church of the
[2:25:02] first which is written in
[2:25:05] heaven and to God the judge of all and
[2:25:09] the spirit of
[2:25:11] judgment made perfect to Jesus the med
[2:25:16] of the
[2:25:17] Newen and to the blood of
[2:25:21] speak better things that
[2:25:24] of Hallelujah Paul was describing the
[2:25:29] divine
[2:25:30] presence that you are now lifted
[2:25:33] into that's where the new
[2:25:36] besses us once you step into the
[2:25:41] channel Hallelujah this is where you
[2:25:44] enter into a presence not a judgment but
[2:25:50] Grace speaking better things than that
[2:25:54] of what are the better things you are a
[2:25:58] son of God you were created to overcome
[2:26:02] you can never become a slave to the
[2:26:04] devil you are being released today

[2:26:09] release Hallelujah today is your day of
[2:26:13] Jubilee do you understand what I mean

[2:26:19] meeting together
[2:26:21] with the souls of just
[2:26:23] men made perfect you have been
[2:26:27] accepted into the Beloved that's what
[2:26:30] you should believe that you are a son of
[2:26:33] God you are a son of Grace you are not a
[2:26:37] son of WRA tell the devil today I am
[2:26:41] going
