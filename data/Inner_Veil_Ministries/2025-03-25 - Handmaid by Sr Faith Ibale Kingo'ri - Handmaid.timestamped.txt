[0:02] The road you've chosen for
[0:05] me has not been an easy
[0:10] one. I'm humbled by your
[0:15] grace and the fact that you chose
[0:22] me. I've been ostracized for being
[0:27] yours. have been misunderstood and
[0:31] judged by men, yet
[0:35] still I yield to your
[0:40] will. I am the handmade of the
[0:45] Lord. I have nothing much to give. I
[0:51] submit to your
[0:54] command.
[0:56] [Music]
[0:57] Holy unto
[0:59] me as you say. Oh, I am the handmade.
[1:06] The handmade of the Lord. I have nothing
[1:12] much to give.
[1:14] eyes of me to your
[1:17] [Music]
[1:19] home. Be it through
[1:23] me as you
[1:27] say like Ruth I'm
[1:31] hungry and gleaning in the
[1:36] field. I lay at your feet,
[1:40] Lord, and pray you will cover
[1:47] me. I've been headless and without a
[1:51] name. I've been praying for my king's
[1:55] man to redeem me and call
[1:59] me his bad.
[2:02] [Music]
[2:04] I am the handmade of the
[2:08] Lord. I have nothing much to give. I
[2:14] submit to your
[2:17] command.
[2:18] [Music]
[2:19] Holy unto
[2:22] me as you say.
[2:27] Like Moses in the
[2:30] wilderness, you've seated
[2:34] me and you've commissioned
[2:39] me as a bride of
[2:44] Jesus. You ask me what is it I'm
[2:49] holding? It's simply a bit upon crooked
[2:54] line. But you
[2:57] say I see I will use
[3:01] it. I am the hand of the Lord. I have
[3:08] nothing much to give. I submit to your
[3:14] command.
[3:16] [Music]
[3:17] Oh, unto
[3:20] me as you say.
[3:23] [Music]
[3:24] I walk by faith, not
[3:28] sight. I know you have great
[3:32] plans. Like Esther, I will
[3:36] say for such a time as this.
[3:42] Oh, I'm
[3:44] watching to see the fourth man in the
[3:47] fire waiting like Lazarus to hear. You
[3:52] call me. Speak low. Thy servant is
[3:58] listening. Oh, I am the hand of the
[4:03] Lord. I have nothing much to
[4:09] do to your command.
[4:15] Glor to
[4:17] me as you
[4:21] [Music]
[4:23] said I
[4:26] as your
[4:32] [Music]
[4:47] single.
[4:49] [Music]
[5:02] Oh, I am the hand. I am the high of the
[5:08] Lord. I have nothing much to give. I
[5:14] submit to
[5:19] you to
[5:21] me as you say. I am ready for your will.
[5:28] Lord to
[5:29] me as you say.
[5:33] I surrender to your will, Lord.
[5:37] To
[5:38] me as you.
[5:41] I give you my heart, Lord. I give you my
[5:46] life.
[5:48] As you
[5:50] said, my savior.
[5:56] as you say. I surrender to your will,
[6:01] Lord.
[6:03] Unto me.
[6:08] [Music]
[6:12] Amen.
