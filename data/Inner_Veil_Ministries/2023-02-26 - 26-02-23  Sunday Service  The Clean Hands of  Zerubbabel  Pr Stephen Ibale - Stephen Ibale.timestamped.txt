[20:01] foreign
[20:04] [Music]
[20:36] crystals amen Amina so let's just stand
[20:40] up how to immediately
[20:44] and get into the scripture reading
[20:47] we shall go to the book of Zechariah
[20:50] Chapter 4.
[20:53] and we read verse 9.
[20:59] before we do
[21:01] [Music]
[21:03] prayers
[21:05] precious Heavenly Father
[21:08] each time we come before your presence
[21:12] our hearts begin to burn within us
[21:17] there's a holy fire of the Holy Spirit
[21:26] of all the vessels of god
[21:30] father we come before you die
[21:34] recognizing your goodness love and mercy
[21:38] knowing that father dear Lord God as the
[21:42] fly of the Holy Spirit bans within us
[21:54] we are living in the most wicked time of
[21:58] history
[22:00] but Heavenly Father
[22:03] you are calling every one of your
[22:05] children
[22:07] to come out of the cosmos the conditions
[22:10] of this world
[22:12] so that we can come into Christ
[22:19] and we pray that you may open your door
[22:23] as you speak to us saying
[22:30] we are your children we want to walk
[22:34] under your guidance
[22:36] under your instructions
[22:38] and the teaching of the world
[22:41] therefore father we commit the word we
[22:43] are going to read
[22:45] into your hands 75
[23:15] so you are really welcome into his
[23:18] presence
[23:19] amen so let's turn to the scripture here
[23:24] Zechariah Chapter 4 verse 9.
[23:28] the hands
[23:32] I've laid the foundation of this house
[23:36] he was talking about the restaurant
[23:40] Tabernacle after the return of Israel
[23:43] from Babylon yeah
[23:49] also finish it
[23:54] and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[23:56] hosts has sent me unto you
[24:02] amen amen may the Lord that blessing the
[24:05] reading of his word
[24:10] so today we want to deal with the
[24:13] subject
[24:15] s
[24:21] amen the Clean Hands
[24:23] [Music]
[24:26] if you want anything clean
[24:30] you have to wash it
[24:33] now so the hands of zeruba they were
[24:35] watched
[24:37] as well he says the foundation of this
[24:40] house
[24:52] deals with the grace for adults
[24:56] for Israel
[24:58] to come out of their captivity
[25:02] to restore the temple
[25:04] that had been broken down
[25:07] and the same Grace
[25:10] pour us out for them
[25:12] in the time of the return from the
[25:16] dispersion
[25:19] amen so it's a compound scripture
[25:24] amen it's so compounds that it also
[25:28] deals
[25:29] with us Amen in the return of the
[25:34] theological uh captivity
[25:39] in the mystery Babylon
[25:41] so you know this is a compound scripture
[25:48] amen and so we deal with ourselves in
[25:52] this dispensation of Grace
[25:56] so this position
[25:59] is God releasing something special
[26:04] in the midst of what he's already doing
[26:07] with the people
[26:10] that while God is doing this
[26:13] he brought something in boom
[26:16] to run for a period of time
[26:20] amen and now that period of time
[26:25] where God is dealing with something new
[26:28] he has dropped into what he's already
[26:30] doing
[26:34] like the book of Acts
[26:36] whether we see the dispensation of Grace
[26:40] for the Gentiles
[26:43] being highlighted
[26:46] he's doing something among the Jews
[26:49] but because they lost the enthusiasm
[26:55] that the word produces
[26:59] gospel literally turns to the Gentiles
[27:04] that's what God does don't and when the
[27:08] gospel came among the Gentiles
[27:12] the moving of this new work
[27:14] is referred to as the dispensation of
[27:18] Grace
[27:21] so there was a turning point
[27:28] took out the benefits of Grace
[27:32] [Music]
[27:42] [Music]
[27:47] the glory
[27:52] foreign
[28:02] [Music]
[28:07] [Music]
[28:14] [Music]
[28:25] [Music]
[28:31] at this present time there is a Remnant
[28:35] according to the election of Grace
[28:39] you find the Jew here Believe In Christ
[28:42] [Music]
[28:47] I mean the major church
[28:52] it's Gentiles so now as Gentiles
[28:57] we have been grafted into the promises
[29:01] we are God's major focus
[29:05] and we must learn how to tap into this
[29:09] blessings
[29:11] while we have the crossing of the hands
[29:14] of Jacob that we don't
[29:17] know amen you remember when uh you know
[29:21] uh Joseph took the boys to be blessed
[29:26] everyone
[29:27] [Music]
[29:28] he brought the bigger on the right and
[29:31] the younger on the left
[29:36] but when he was blessing them
[29:39] he crossed the hands and Jacob says
[29:44] this is the order oh no no foreign
[29:51] [Music]
[30:04] [Music]
[30:13] [Music]
[30:42] by rejecting the uh Ministry of Jeremiah
[30:46] the prophet
[30:49] we find that they fell into Babylon
[30:52] because
[30:53] so you know Israel
[30:56] is the church natural
[30:59] then you know Church in the New
[31:01] Testament
[31:02] is the church spiritual
[31:05] Israel Israeli these are you know
[31:09] Shadows but the reality is down here how
[31:14] they fall was the shadows of how the New
[31:18] Testament Church
[31:22] [Music]
[31:23] amen
[31:27] that when the church falls it would fall
[31:31] also into a Babylon conditions
[31:35] amen and it's Paul who said
[31:39] according to the grace of God
[31:42] which is given unto me
[31:45] as a wise Master Builders
[31:48] I've learned the foundation
[31:50] and another building
[32:00] amen so while the church moves
[32:07] [Music]
[32:14] amen because
[32:17] means you know the seat of Satan
[32:20] that's where the devil was outstanding
[32:23] to take the church into captivity
[32:26] are you together with me
[32:29] [Music]
[32:30] which was during the program
[32:34] that the revelation of the openness
[32:42] they rejected
[32:45] foreign
[33:04] [Music]
[33:22] [Music]
[33:34] [Music]
[33:45] but the same way Israel is brought back
[33:49] to rebuild in the temple
[33:55] and also they are brought back everybody
[33:58] listen from and even as they are brought
[34:01] back
[34:03] Amen to rebuild the back of the nation
[34:06] of
[34:07] Israeli is the same way the church is
[34:11] called
[34:12] by the message of Malachi 4. to building
[34:17] the world's best church
[34:28] and it's at this time
[34:30] [Music]
[34:33] amen says according to the grace of God
[34:38] which is given unto me as a wise
[34:42] I have learned the foundation
[34:51] [Music]
[34:57] to continue on the foundation
[35:02] amen amen because Paul well Paul was the
[35:06] Apostle to the Gentiles
[35:09] was an apostle to the Hebrews
[35:13] amen amen praise the Lord are you here
[35:17] with me today
[35:19] amen so when you look at Moses
[35:23] amen amen I'm putting a lot of things
[35:26] together
[35:27] but you are going to see how it opens up
[35:30] for you
[35:33] when you look at Moses
[35:35] he built the ark yes
[35:37] [Music]
[35:45] and set up the veil of the covering
[35:50] and covered the Ark of the testimony
[35:54] as the Lord commanded Moses
[35:59] [Music]
[36:02] and a cloud covered in the tent of the
[36:05] congregation
[36:08] and the glory of the Lord
[36:11] [Music]
[36:14] amen amen each time the ark is brought
[36:18] into the Tabernacle is
[36:21] the glory of the Lord
[36:23] comes down among the people
[36:26] when the ark is taken away from the
[36:29] tablet went away from here the glory of
[36:33] the Lord
[36:34] departed from the people
[36:36] when Moses finished building
[36:40] [Music]
[36:42] the glory of the Lord
[36:44] when David finished
[36:49] the glory of God
[36:51] are you together when Solomon finished
[36:56] the
[36:58] glory of God came down
[37:01] even in the
[37:06] [Music]
[37:20] so when the church
[37:24] [Music]
[37:30] therefore the restoration
[37:32] brings the glory back into the house is
[37:36] that actually one number and that's why
[37:38] before the opening of the seventh seeds
[37:42] brother Brandon preached two special
[37:45] messages
[37:50] [Music]
[37:54] and in those two messages
[38:00] [Music]
[38:03] one which is not built with hands
[38:07] [Music]
[38:10] is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[38:15] [Music]
[38:21] amen amen and then God gives him the
[38:24] Revelation
[38:27] which is the revelation
[38:38] [Music]
[38:51] [Music]
[39:24] [Music]
[39:28] Miracles can
[39:35] [Music]
[39:40] once you know the ark is in the
[39:43] Tabernacles
[39:44] when the glory of God is
[39:48] and we thank God
[39:50] the opening of The Seven Seals
[39:54] God was rest over here
[40:00] which is not built by hearts
[40:05] that you are the temp of God
[40:08] and that the spirit of God
[40:11] the glory of God
[40:16] amen amen praise the Lord
[40:19] amen so we thank God we just need to
[40:23] come out of work
[40:25] to come out of the Fallen religious
[40:28] system
[40:30] back into the apostolic Foundation

[40:39] manifesting the body of foreign
[40:51] [Music]
[41:06] [Music]
[41:32] [Music]
[41:47] now verse one
[41:50] and the angel that talked with me came
[41:53] again
[41:55] and wake me
[41:57] as a man that is awakened out of sleep
[42:02] [Music]
[42:04] now
[42:06] when Israel was in captivity
[42:10] are you together with me when Israel was
[42:14] in captivity

[42:32] saying in chapter 4 verse 1.

[43:36] when you awake you brought your eyes
[43:40] open
[43:41] when the church was in the valley

[44:34] do you know that you are filled
[44:36] constantly or they try to say what would
[44:39] they do you know that there is a person
[44:41] who walks with you
[44:42] the person of the Lord
[44:45] he says I'll show you things
[44:48] at a higher level that you've never
[44:52] known before
[44:53] amen Zechariah awakened out of sleep
[44:59] [Music]
[45:00] then he was asked
[45:32] [Music]
[45:45] [Music]
[46:01] you've gone through things you cannot
[46:04] even describe
[46:06] God was dealing with you to build you
[46:10] into pure golden candlesticks
[46:15] and fill you with Glory
[46:17] of his oil of his anointing of his
[46:23] spirit that you may shine to this
[46:30] whatever
