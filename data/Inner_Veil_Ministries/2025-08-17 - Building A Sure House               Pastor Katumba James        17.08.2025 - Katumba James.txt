And father, may the word transform us. May the word release us from all captivity. May the word save the sinners, Lord. May the word wash us from all unrighteousness. May the word fill us with your holy spirit that you may have preeminence in our lives. We have preeminence here in our mid. Bless us all together, father. meet all the needs of your children preeminence upon this meeting for the grow of your holy name. We also pray for our pastor as he ministers in today. We use him for the grow of your holy name and all other meetings taking place in different places. We pray you may speak to your children and bless us all together here who are here at church and even those on online. Lord, we lift them all into your hands that your purpose and will may be done. We love you and we thank you, Lord. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and ask this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I'm happy to be back today. Praise the name of our Lord. Last Sunday I was in Camolei at Pastor S's church. I taken brother George Franklin there to minister. They sent greetings from Cami. Praise the name of the Lord. Then on Wednesday we also went to church. Pastor Charles Mu's church had also taken the visitor there to minister. They also send their greetings. Praise the name of our Lord. We keep our brother in prayers. Last Friday preached in Nakaso. Today's preaching also in Nakaso. Then on Wednesday's preaching at Zana. So I requested brother Cyrus on Thursday to go and pick him from. And I appreciate that he has a good car to do that. So I'm praying for more cars to come. Praise the name of our Lord. S that you don't only use your car for your family, for your business, but even the work of the king. Praise the name of our Lord. Even building good homes. Praise the name of our Lord. Why would we spend money in hotels when somebody has a good home? So, we're also praying for good homes. Praise the name of our Lord. Not only good house, but even the husband and wife and the children to be good. Praise your name, oh God. That's why you can find peace. The house may be good. But it's a prison. So you can't take there a visa. Praise the name of Lord. But in the house which is stable, then God can always visit that house. And those are the homes we are looking at. Praise the name over. So our pastor today is not around. He's preaching at brother Jeremas Church. Keep him in your prayers. Then we want to receive the children who came back from school. I see Benjamin &gt;&gt; and then others. We appreciate that you you're back. We have any visa coming here for the first time. If you can raise your hand for recognition, you're welcome. Our sister with you. Praise the name of our Lord. So this afternoon we shall have the youth meeting. Praise the name of our Lord. And I want to appreciate those who turned up for yesterday's meeting, praying and fasting. But our zeal is so low, very low. And these are the things of God, but we take them lightly. So we need to see that our zeal comes up and the more we have a zeal for the Lord is the more the Lord comes down in our lives and is the more the Lord fights our battles. You waste a lot of your time fighting your own battle without God. You'll run the whole year. But when you rely on the Lord, what you've taken 10 years, you can do it within less than a year. So we need that we we really take the things of God serious and then how the Lord will fight all these things that disturb you and you'll see how God is building a house. Praise the name of So on Sunday, this coming Sunday, we're going to have brother George Franklin preach here. He's a brother from Nigeria and he preached two services. So we shall have two services here. I'm expecting some people to be with us. So we shall have a meal together and I call upon your contribution. to brother Peter Aula. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, we spend about I think about 1 million to one and a half for food. 1 million to 1 million and a half for food. Praise the name of our Lord. And some of you that is just less than half of your salary. you come up and do that. Praise the name of But now everybody thinks now he's going to do it. If you don't do it, then who will do it? And when God blesses the other person then why would you think why God have you forgotten me? because you don't know where to put because it's more blessed to give but here you are giving not only to one person you're giving to many and you're giving to the kingdom I don't know how much blessings the lord will bless you we need to see that we own these burdens praise the name of let us own this burden like yesterday I received a message &gt;&gt; and then they were telling me that our internet subscription for for Wi-Fi has expired. &gt;&gt; Now I had no option. I had to make sure that is renewed. But there are so many other needs which we have among the ministers which is always not brought to the people but then others have to see that they meet those costs. So let us see that we come up to support the work. Praise the name of our lord. All these many things actually which do happen but you see some few people share that burden. Let us also take interest in participating in the services of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. So I would call upon your contribution to that cause. And then there are also other new churches new members we get from different places. Sometimes they even cannot afford to transport themselves. So sometimes we have to lend a hand. Praise the name of our Lord. In many times in missions, you get to places but even the people want the gospel but their physical life is so bad. So you spend on your costs then even to their costs. It becomes a big burden and these are areas where we need to come up. Let us lend a helping hand to others who are not privileged where we are privileged. Some people don't have even water. Some people don't have different things. Then you get a call from maybe a pastor, one of those pastors. I'm in hospital, but I even don't have money to test the blood 5,000. Somebody's calling from afar. If only 5,000. Now if they cannot ask that, how are they eating then? So let us be concerned about others &gt;&gt; to know that there are other people who are of the body of Jesus Christ but they not as privileged as we are. So we need to see that we reach out to them give them support. Praise the name of our Lord. And then some don't have even what to put on. He says, "My shoes are torn up." But he's preaching. The shirt is putting on, you know, the the collar is totally torn and he's putting a tie and he's happy, but you get him in the same shirt over the time. But the zillas for the Lord is then for us, we have too many. Let us learn to share what we have. That's part of the gospel. Praise the name of our Lord. Not saying God keep yourself warm, but you are not giving me what to cover myself. Not saying God bless you, but I'm going to sleep hungry. But then for you have a lot. The Bible says true religion, you know, is to go out and do that. Let us learn to be doing those kind of things. Praise the name of God. Let us invite the to come and sing. You're welcome. Praise the name of our Lord. Now, she has been at school and we thank God that she's back. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Jesus blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the sweetest frame but holy on Jesus name. On Christ the holy drop I stand. All of the ground is the ground. [Music] In darkness seems to hide his face. I will stoching [Music] in every high and Oh, I am the host within the Christ the grounding stand. [Music] Another round is singing sound. [Music] His blood supports me in the willing around my soul strength. Be there is all my hope and see. for Christ the soul is singing son [Music] is singing song when he shall come with trumpet sound may I [Music] crown praise in his righteousness alone to stand before Ad [Music] [Music] Christy Ro [Music] [Applause] He is in his [Music] Christ. He broke us [Music] &gt;&gt; soul broke. [Music] &gt;&gt; Christ broke guys down. Amen. Before they go, let us clap for them. Before they go, just come back. Praise the name of our Lord. These are good songs to hear more and more. Praise the name. I told brother Martin to get me all our original songs. Then I put them on a flash. &gt;&gt; So from the time he gave me the flash, I think it was on last Sunday, last Saturday the other week. So they keep on playing in the car. So I was hearing this &gt;&gt; then I heard you know Christ stand. and then let them down. &gt;&gt; Let them down. &gt;&gt; So let us stand up and sing let them down &gt;&gt; while they lead us. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of Allah. [Music] Just let all your burdens praise the name of our Lord. [Music] Rock of aes. [Music] Let me hide myself in thee. Let the The hand of God [Music] from thy Oh your semise. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Take your bodies to the rock of aes. Oh, let them down. &gt;&gt; Oh, let them down. Heaven take your mind of it. Good my dear [Music] forever. Oh my god.

We thank God for such, you know, spiritfilled singing. Praise the name of our Lord. He just revives you over and over again. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us pray before we go to the reading of the word. Father, we want to rejoice before you Lord for the great things that you do in our ministry. And now we appreciate you, Father that in every challenge, you have always put a way out of it. And we thank thee, Father. Now we pray that you may bless our hearts. Speak to us, Father. May the Holy Spirit search our hearts. Help us in the name of Jesus Christ. Receive that you've ordained for us today father and filling us with your spirit in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. Let us go to our scriptures. We're reading in first kings chapter 11 and then verse 38 only. First Kings 11 verse 38. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "And it shall be if thou will hearken unto all that I command thee, and will walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, that I will be with you and build you a sure house, as I built for David and will give Israel unto you. Amen. You may be seated. Praise the name of our Lord. So I want to preach on the subject building a sure house building a sure house. Praise the name of our Lord. And you know like in the normal house construction you know you take step by step and then you use different materials. Praise the name of our Lord and then you use different skills and then it takes time. Praise the name of our Lord. There are different skills. Praise the name of our Lord. And you know like you know in construction like if we go to the the way the world has set it you know the the mind the the owner has the mind of what they want. So then he goes to an architect And then he tells him his mind. I want a house of this number of bedrooms. I want it to be like this. I want it to be like this. So he gets your mind and then he tries to make a draft and then he tries to give you. Do you want it like this? And nowadays technology has made things easy. There is you know different software as to draw for you the building plan. So you just put this that and then it can come with a beautiful picture. Those days it was all on drawing board. You just sit on the drawing board. You said this. You do this. But now things have been made easy until they can put there for you the trees. They put for you there the bed. They put for you there, you know, the paving, the car, and then you see a real picture. Sometimes they can even make a video and then you say, "Hey, this is how the house is going to be like. This is where I'm going to sit. They can do all that." But you see, to come up with that, it takes a lot of effort. It takes time. It takes materials. And it takes Okay. It takes the right material. It takes the right skills, the right people and sometimes even the right equipment like in there is a place I I saw in Toro when I was still working there and this man built his hospital is highly educated person but then he got standard materials because he was using metals to do the roofing, not even timber and then you would look at the building. So you find out when you are outside and you look at the roof which is called the eve. It starts here with about 4 ft. But when you go to the end there, it's only 2 ft. Then you start wondering what happened. Good materials, quality materials, but poor skilled people. Then you go and then look at the ceiling spent good money, but all of it is cracked up. Then you go and look at the floor. But now when you look at that, however much you grind it, it's always dirty. He had the right materials. He had the right plan. But he used the wrong people. to do the work. So you wouldn't get a good job done. So in construction, you must have the right plan. You must have the right materials. You must have the right people to do the job and the right equipment. And then you must give it time. Now a house we should look at it as you as an individual as a house. Praise the name of our Lord. God took takes time to build you. Praise the name of the Lord. And then a house we should look at it as your family. Then a house we should look at it as a church. Our church then a house we should look at it has the kingdom of God. So we are talking about building a sure house. How do you build a sure house? You as an individual as the house. Then your family as the house. Then the church as the house. Then the kingdom of God as a house. Praise the name of our Lord. Now we see God was telling Jeroboam and he told him in the scripture that we have read and said, "If you will hearken to all that I command you and will walk in my ways, not your own ways." Because you can have your own ways, but those are not the ways of God. You can get the ways of the world. You can get the ways of your your your profession like sometimes the ways of our profession. You know the things we've been taught in school are contrary to the way the Lord does things. For example, somebody who has done economics, you know, oh maybe they are taught the more you holding the money is better for you. Then God tells you to give is more blessed than the other one. They are teaching you don't give. God is telling you give. &gt;&gt; Even they teach you if somebody has a debt with you, you try to hold some back. Then God tells you if you have somebody's debt, pay him. He comes today, don't sleep with his money. Then they tell you no, what you need to do, keep this money and put it in the bank and make more interest and you give them. God says no the ways of man than the ways of God. Then he was telling Jeroboam, if you'll walk in my ways. And then he says, and do that is right in my sight. to keep my statutes and my commandments as David my servant did that I will be with you. See the condition God is giving it's not difficult. He's telling you just follow my instruction. Just follow my guidelines. follow my plan. Praise the name of the Lord. Just follow it. And then he said, I will be with you. Now he's telling you, I have come to build you a house. But how will he build you a house? He's calling for your cooperation. Let us be co-workers, but let me be your guide. Not you to take whatever you want and then you remember me when you want, but from every step of the way that you can depend upon the leadership of God. Then he said, "I will build you a sure house as I built for David and will give you Israel." Because it's God who called Jeroboam and said, "I'm giving you the 10 tribes and is the one who made the people favor Jeroboam until they when Jerobam was even not in the country. Then they called to him please come and they said you be our leader. Then rehobam &gt;&gt; when he heard that the 10 tribes were rejecting him from being their king. He got the armies to go and fight Israel. Then God told him, "Don't go. Those are your brothers." So you see already God was protecting the kingdom of Jeroboam because it was the will of God that let Jeroboam rule distrib. But now Jeroboam after he had become the king his heart turned away from God. He started devising his own things. He started taking his own path. He started doing his own ways. And he forgot everything about God. But Jeroboam, he had an example to look to. And that was King David. And God told him, "If you'll do everything the way David did, said I'm going to build you a praise the name of our Lord." And God has not left us without a witness. You have somebody to look to who has gone through what you're going through and have been able to overcome. Praise the name of the Lord. There's somebody who is ahead of you. Somebody God has put before you in your life to overcome to be a sure house of God in your life. There's somebody God has put ahead of you. God has given grace, who has overcome what you are overcome, who has overcome what you're going through. So there is already a sure house before you. God also wants you to be a sure house in your family. There's an example God has put before you. How you can have your family also be a sure house. How we can make our church be a sure house. How we can have the kingdom of God established into a sure house. Praise the name of our Lord. God was telling Jeroboam, "David, my servant did this thing and I built him a shower house." Praise the name of our Lord. We all need to be to be building shower houses as your anid be a house. Your family, let it be a showhouse. Our church, let it be a showhouse. How will the things happen? And you know construction is step by step. Praise the name of our Lord. It's a step by step. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in Matthew chapter 7 &gt;&gt; and then verse 24 the Bible says &gt;&gt; therefore soever heareth these sayings of mine and does them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock. [Music] Praise the name of the Lord. He says, "Whoever heareth my sayings, whoever heareth my word and obeys them," then he says, "He is a wise man." What does the wise man do? He said he built his house on a rock. Praise the name of the Lord. You know when people are building, praise the name of the Lord. That having been my work for a number of years, you go to a place where they building. Somebody digs a foundation of one ft just from here up to here. down is soil. And then when they build the thing which comes above the soil, that's what they call the foundation. And you find it's about four, five ft up. But what is down is short. Now when it starts raining you will see the foundation is up this way and then you say hey what's happened this house and the house starts cracking and falls that's what they do most of the places but yet you're meant to build at least dig two and a half feet the only one because it's saving material and found you can't repair it many times. So if it damages all the upper thing cracks, crumbles. So they want to put most money up but then down there's nothing good. Like some of those buildings you see when you see the wall is too small or the columns are too small. Now when they come to finish then they put a thick layer of motor but that's not the thing that holds the house. It is this small thing which he has cheated and then he puts this outer thing then you'll say I've bought a house then after some time the house is collapsing because the builders didn't do the right job and then sometimes they build the walls and they put little cement and then when it comes to plaster they try put material insect start getting inside there. Many things. So Jesus saying a wise man will build the house on his rock. So your foundation must be strong. Praise the name of the Lord. What foundation are you building for your family? What foundation are you building for your family? What foundation are we building for the church? What foundation? And all this comes from the decisions that you make. He says, "He that heareth my words and does them." Now, if you hear the word and you don't do this, your decisions are wrong. So, if your decisions are wrong, you are building a house that will not last. You are getting your life into disaster. You are getting your family into this area. What foundation are you building? Praise the name of the Lord. Like if you want to marry, what is the choice of the person you're choosing to marry? Are you looking at something here? The way the the world looks at things, it's a wrong foundation. Ah, she looks better than the others. That's a flower. Not the flower does what? Wilts. So when it it wields, &gt;&gt; what are you going to do? So you say maybe I exchange and get another one. Building a foundation. &gt;&gt; Then he says, "And the rain descended." Verse 25. And the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock. Now you see this scripture here. You are building a house but not that there are circumstances that come adverse weather effects. You know things which are tough, storms come, floods come, vibrations come. Like when they're building some of these roads and then the road is passing vibrating and it it now vibrates and now your house you feel like as if it's going to break down wrong foundation. If now that roll alone can make that what foundation how are you building your house? How are you making the decisions that affect your life? How are you setting up your family? Praise the name of the Lord. How are you handling the things of your life? Oh, it's just like Ahab because the Bible says it was a small thing. It seemed a light thing. He does this. But that one is okay. He does the other. is okay. How are you building your house? Because the rains will come, the floods will come, the winds will come and they will come against that house. Now those frustrations in this life, circumstances come in your life, temptations will come, trials will come, conditions change. Praise the name of our Lord. Sometimes something happens which you never expected. So how do you handle those adverse conditions that it's all about how you've built your heart. how your life is standing, how your family is standing. Praise the name of the Lord. Like if you marry, your wife is married or your husband gets an accident or your husband loses the job, then it was not built right. There are things you are looking at and not the right thing. Not the oneness in marriage. Not the unity in loving one another. Until you until you vote until death. Now that one is just in the mouth but in the heart and they fire from that job and is no longer for me I want to be called Mrs. Honorable losing a parliamentary seat parliament you're losing anything &gt;&gt; and he loses everything. I can't be laughed at. The car's got problems. &gt;&gt; We start footing. Ah, baby. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. &gt;&gt; I look for another one. &gt;&gt; There was a saying which they were asking. They were asking people, would you rather laugh on or cry in a b I would rather at least be in a I'm crying people's choices doesn't know that even on you can afford the Bord and then you die soon praise the name of but people's decision are different. So we need to see that we build a sure house. Then in verse 26, he says, "And everyone that hears these sayings of mine and does them not shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand, and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and bit up. They beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it. Praise the name of God. Now the Bible says we are built upon the foundation of the prophets and the apostles Jesus Christ being the chief cornerstone. That's the foundation to build up. And so you need that you build everything. If we are building any house, build it on the rock foundation. Build it. Build it on the word of God. Your life, let it be built on the word of God. Your family, let it be built on the word of God. And then the church, we are building it on the word of God. The kingdom of God is built by the word of God. And that's what God was telling Jeroboam. If you will hear these things and then do these things, then I will build you a sure house. Praise the name of our Lord. And he was meaning the kingdom of Israel. You'll be established and you'll see the kingdom prospering. And it's the same thing even to us. How will the Lord bless us? Let us do what the Lord wants us to do. Praise the name of our Lord. That's what God wants us to do. Do what is right. Obey his word. Just like David. Because the Bible says in 1 Samuel chapter 13 and then verse 13. And Samuel said to Saul, "Thou hast done foolishly, thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee. For now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever. So the prophet was telling the king, why have you not obeyed the commandment of God said you've done foolishly? You are destroying your house. You are troubling your house. And many of us trouble our houses. We trouble our lives by going into things contrary to the word of God. And then you get yourself into more trouble. You find you in this trouble from this another trouble. It keeps on coming or even your family. You trouble your house. Today you are saying this. The other day you are saying that nobody can even understand it. How do you live in a house? Husband does not understand wife. The wife does not understand the husband. The children don't understand the father or the mother. Even the parents don't understand the children. Just in the same house by circumstance. Everybody is looking at how we can be liberated from that house. Houses are not meant to be bondages. They are meant to be places of freedom. But then how will you have freedom in your house in your household in your family if you've put God aside? Now the Bible says in the book of Proverbs verse 11 29 verse 29 he says he that traveth his own house shall inherit wind that's what the Bible is saying travel your house today you are putting new laws or you are breaking them together. You know, you just like a a shifting kind of island. This wind comes from the north, drives it to the south. Then he says, "This is where we belong." Now another wind comes from there drives it to the east shifting sun. That's a house that's built not on the word of God. Even our lives we should be reliable at your place of work. Be reliable at your home. Be reliable in your community. reliable. Now there are some people who know how to change phones every other day. Yes. Today is calling you on this number. Hey who I am so and so. Hey what happened after one month is another life. What happens do this way? You know just like parents who like changing children from one school to the other goes and gets habits of this school. term one term two is in another school then again another school until the child gives up on study this holiday with this relative when do you raise your children. This way here, the other way were there, the other way were there. Until the children become confused, traveling your house, not reliable. So you find that somebody grows up in that kind of situation, troubled life, so much exposed to many funny things until even their thoughts are corrupted. And the Bible says if you travel your house, you shall inherit wind. I don't know what how you you you inherit wind. You can't even keep it in a room. Even the wind which is put in a balloon can bust. So you end up losing everything because you are traveling your house. So that was what Saul was doing. He traveled his house when he was not obedient to the word of God. He traveled his house. These men go to fight. They are hungry for three days. They have not eaten anything. Then they find honey. They are hungry. They in the battle. He says nobody should eat anything. Then the son said, why does my father travel the house? So there are some of those decisions make which are not right. Why would you travel your house? How do you travel your house? By not following the word of God. As a wife do be as a wife as the Bible says. Praise the name of as a husband. Be as a husband as the Bible says. But now you shift goalpost. You are traveling your house. So at the end of the day, you inherit wind. Praise the name of God. You inherit wind. When the children of Israel, we are taking over the cities. God told them, "Don't take anything from those places you are conquering." And then there was a and he saw the Babylonian garment said ah this is a blessing &gt;&gt; I can't leave this he took it and many of the children of Israel perished in the now in Joshua 6:1 17 the Bible says and the city shall be a cast given it and all that are there in to the Lord. Joshua chapter chapter 6 rather verse 17 6 verse 17 the topic and the city shall be a cast even it and all that are therein to the Lord only Rahab the hallot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that went and ye and in any wise keep yourselves from the acast thing, lest you make yourself a cast and when you take of the acast thing and make the camp of Israel a curse and travel itch. I want to be Now he said if you take the accost thing you'll make the whole camp of Israel a cast. And so when you get away from the ways of God, when you get away from the word of God and then you do something contrary, then it is all not good. Praise the name of our Lord. It is something that is cast, something which is out of the way. So now if you find yourself you are out of the way, the way of the Lord, you need to get back to the way of the Lord. You need to get back to what the Lord is saying. That's how you build a sure house. That's how you can have a blessing of the Lord. But now when Akan saw the things in Joshua chapter 7 and then verse 20, &gt;&gt; the scripture says, "And Akan answered Joshua and said, "Indeed, I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done. When I saw the spoils of a goodly babylonish garment and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels weight, then I coverted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it. When [Music] Ichech Now brought death to Israel when he took the things that were cast. Now there are some of these things of the world which are so attractive, so enticing, say, I wish I would have that. &gt;&gt; I wish I would get this kind of thing. And then you find yourself, you are converting after these things, but yet they are bringing destruction in your life. They are bringing destruction in your house. So we need to see that we avoid everything that's of the world that is contrary to what the way of the Lord is. Praise the name of our Lord. see that you avoid things that are contrary to the word of God to be like a brought death to his family himself, his wife and the children were all destroyed because of the thing he lasted after. So we need to see that we build a sure house. We need to see that you know we have the kingdom of God established in our lives. Let the kingdom of God be established in your family. See that you do everything according to the way the Lord has taught us to do. Let us build a sure house. Let us follow the word of the Lord. Don't turn left. and right. That's what God was telling Joshua. Follow the law of Moses. Read it. Meditate upon it day and night. Praise the name of our God. And then how will you learn to do the right thing? If you don't give yourself over to reading the word of God, you don't take time to hear the word of God. Now the Bible says, "Praise the name of our Lord." Let us go to the book of First Corinthians chapter 13. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; First Corinthians. Chapter 13. Okay. Sorry. Chapter 14 and then verse 30. It says, Let your women keep silence in the churches, for it's not permitted unto them to speak, but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also says the Lord. [Music] Verse 35. &gt;&gt; And if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for women to speak in the church. Now you see this responsibility here. husband. &gt;&gt; Do you know the word of God? But then you find a husband is all the time re doing his work. Even time of prayer is dozing because he's tired. He's tired. But now the Bible says if the wife is to ask, let them ask their husband at home. But then your husband doesn't know the word. Troubled house. He doesn't know his position doesn't have time to read the word. He will raise his family as maybe by chance and by luck. just by chance. &gt;&gt; Today he's saying this, tomorrow is saying another you can't find him anywhere. And then people don't know the word of God because the head is Christ. The head of the man is Christ and Christ is the word. But this man doesn't have the word. He doesn't have the head. So anything is going to use it. &gt;&gt; Women of these days if she familiars you, you bless her. There is no head there. Now fear, terror. If he's going to ask anything immediately just says why do you ask me? So that shirts the question the next time headless because the head is Christ the head is the word but it's not there but then maybe sometimes you got into this marriage maybe because you saw he's good maybe he's having this good job he has a good house he has a good car and that one I can't leave. Now when you get inside then you find that there is no head. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; No head. But you are but you vote to live with that headless life. What a horrible situation you'll be in. &gt;&gt; So you need to be careful. Be careful &gt;&gt; what decisions you make. [Music] &gt;&gt; Does he have the head? Why is it &gt;&gt; so you get into troubles when he doesn't care is doing his own thing like he didn't care and then you are in that trouble first year second year 10 years how long are you going to be on earth with that make the right decision. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Or even brothers, he may just say, "Ah, this one looks good." Like Samson says, "I like that one." Say, "But we have better in Israel." For him was attracted by the appearance and he ended up losing his glory. Because the other one was a money maker. Not interested in your relationship or fellowship. what they go with. If you lose your job, marriage is over. He looks for the highest bidder. Now, let me just read this thing here. Yeah. Choosing of the bride. He says again the kind of woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition and his character. If a man chooses the wrong woman, it reflects his character and what he ties himself to shows truly what is in him. A woman reflects what's in the man. When he chooses her for a wife, it shows what's down in him. No matter what he says outside, watch what he marries. Yeah. You see, I think this one was interested in this. And because that's the thing that attracted the person, then he says, "I go to a man's office and he says he's a Christian pins up all around the walls. Those old boowig music going on. I don't care what he says. I don't believe his testimony because his spirit is feeding on them things of the world. [Music] Now you don't need to put them on the wall now. But what do you spend most of your time on phone? Because you are feeding. It's a spirit all the time. You're in rumor mongering politics. &gt;&gt; Hey, this sports betting &gt;&gt; those are spirits. &gt;&gt; Feeding on this, feeding on this, feeding on this. Then he says &gt;&gt; what say if he marries a chorus girl or what would call a sex queen or just a pretty modern ricketer. It reflects It shows what he has in his mind of what his future home is going to be because he's took the her to raise his children by now. If herself she doesn't have morals, what kind of children are they going to be raised? like you see on the streets, the mothers putting on tight things and then the children doing the same. There's a school I was told that you know they told the girls to put on pettic coats petty they said we we don't have them even our mothers don't put them on that kind of condition we have today they just don't care if the mother doesn't do it how will the daughters be raised up How are the children going to be raised up? What house are you building? What character are you molding? Same thing with us parents. What example are we giving the children? What examples are you giving them? All the time maybe you are quarreling all the time. You are dodging. Every time the child does something, keep on promising. promising. It's just deceiving me. &gt;&gt; What kind of children are you raising up? How are you building your house until your children don't trust you anymore and that's where the trouble comes in. And then there are also some situations where the parents overrust their children until they don't do due diligence. The child tells you this, you take it 100%. You don't go and find out. The child is telling me this. But let me go and find out is what the child telling me true. The child tells you about against teachers at school. Those teachers are bad and then you end up losing your children because they know how to deceive you. So everything they know where to touch. By the time you discover it's too late, why don't you do due diligence as a parent? Go and find out what's happening and do it with calmness, not being rough. They have talked about your child. Go and determine what is happening. Really that's how we raise our children. Let us look at here. Let us go to the book of Esther. Praise the name of our Lord. Let's go to the book of Esther chapter 2. And then we read in verse 10, Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred, for Modi had charged her that she should not show it. And Modi walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did and what should become of her. He took interest out how is Esther doing. He goes out there. &gt;&gt; He asks these people, "How is Esther? &gt;&gt; How is she doing? &gt;&gt; How is she behaving? Talks to her." As parents, take interest in your children and some are too busy. They have taken their children to school and have no time to visit them. When it comes to visitation, no time to talk to the teachers. So all the time he's too busy even when they call him hey what do you want have you increase school fees fees? &gt;&gt; No listen first but just rough is not concerned about how the children are fairing. How are you building your house? Praise the name of our Lord. And you know the Bible says let us speak this scripture about children. Ephesians chapter 6 verse4. The Bible says and you fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nature and admonition of the Lord. He said nature, you know, discipline, you know, find out what their condition is. Let your children not become strangers to you all the day you at work. You come back tired and then you find you have them the people help you keep your children at home but you are too rough to those people keep your children too rough. You don't want to hear what they telling you or even when they say something, you take it against them, but you don't take time. They told me this kid likes doing this and this. Take time. Find out find out the affairs of your children. You in order to discipline them, find the facts. But some people they are only watching for the mistakes of the people who keep their children only not the discipline of their children. This person who keeps your children is a hier. You remain with your children. How is the discipline of your children? How are you nurturing your children? How are you raising your children? How do you do that? &gt;&gt; You know at home when you are there no time of fellowship with them. You even don't know whether they know to do this or they don't know. Like now when you have children at home, they don't know how to wash their clothes. They don't know how to make their bed. They don't know how to wash things after eating. when they finish eating. Hey, how are you raising them now? When they grow up, maybe in future we shall have robots. &gt;&gt; So, you just command the robot, you put a program at this time when I finish come on the table and pick the things but sometimes you may not afford those robots. How are we raising our children? How are we building our houses? So the Bible says let us discipline know the affairs of your children knew the affairs of Esther followed step by step with Esther all the way. Walk with your children all the way. You stress yourself to work the money you are making. You want to raise your children but you're raising them without display. What will become of them? How are they going to have their families? Why are they going to work when they don't have display? No character. So you need to see that you take time as a parent to find out how your children are doing. Who are the friends of your children? But maybe you don't care. What do their friends spend most of the time doing? Why do don't your children trust in you? See that you find out or maybe they have gone far away from you? Do you take interest where they stay? How they live? Do you do sport checks? Like now some of the children when they go to universities or colleges they think they are free they want to do whatever they want to do. Find out where do they stay. Is there somebody mature in that area to give you a report? Because in growth we are tutored and the tutor has to give a report but now your children are without a tutor or if there is a ttor you are paying you only wait for the reports of max got 99% ah this is good but life is not only Max, there are other things about life. How are you raising your children? They don't know maybe how to pray. Maybe they don't know how to pray. Maybe they don't know how to read. Maybe they don't take interest in the things of God. As a parent, you're meant to take these things to them. like Abraham. Praise the name of our Lord. Abraham is a very good example. When God called Abraham out of the land of the child, praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Genesis chapter 12 and then verse one. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, into a land that I will show thee. That was the gospel. Now, the way Jeroboam was told, I'm giving you the kingdom of Israel. Abraham, I'm giving you a land. Then to us, I'm giving you salvation. Praise the name of our Lord. I'm giving you a family. the gospel. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm giving you this, &gt;&gt; but one thing you need to do, get out from the kindred and your father's house and the land I'm going to show you." Jeroboam was given a house, a house of Israel, but he failed the house of Israel. And God desire to build him a sure house. The same thing when God gives you something, his desire is to make it better than what it is. When he got the earth in a confused condition, void without form, darkness full of it. He wanted to build it into a sure house, a garden of Eden. But see what stages he took it through. We all have got the call of God. Come unto me you are heavy laden and I'll give you rest. So when you come now the question is if you have really come to Christ, why do you say you don't have rest? But he says come at me and I'll give you rest. Then there has to be something wrong which is happening. So God called Abraham. And then God told him, I'll make thee of a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great and you shall be a blessing. The promises says come out. I'm going to put you here. Just follow my instruction. I'm going to bless you in everything. And that's what the Lord has done the same. Come unto me. I will take care of you. I will protect you. I will meet all your needs and then somewhere you know you don't exceed. These are the things you know you were youth. It's good to put on. How would they know that you are also there? Praise the name of the Lord. You are sliding and when you are sliding sometimes you can get bruises when you fall down. So then he told him in verse, so Abraham departed, as the Lord had spoken to him. Praise the name of our Lord, he obeyed. This is what we are meant to do. Obey. Praise the name of our Lord. Just obey. You know like with the servants of Nan when Elisha told him, "Go and dip yourself seven times in Jordan." The man had leprosy, inturable leprosy. Now he goes to where the healing is and is despising instruction. And that's the same thing. You can't build a sure house when you are despising instructions. You can't build a good family when you put the word of God away. You can't be a victorious Christian if you don't fully walk by the word of the Lord. You can't do that. So despise he would tolerate his but not to go down to be washed. And some of those conditions we have in life when a meeting is called I don't have time. I'm too busy. You are despising your cleaning. You are despising your victory. You are delaying. So you end up in a trouble continuously. These are simple things but you don't want to do them but the devil holds you back until you are not obedient. So Abraham went and you see now when Abraham got in the position God put him in, God would always come down and have fellowship with Abraham. And then God went further and told Abraham, "Now that you are in this land, walk before me and be perfect. Praise the name of our Lord. He's building a sure house. He said, "I've called you. I'm going to bless you." And then Abraham obeyed. He went into the land. God kept on coming to commune with him. And as time went on, Abraham, he got to know more about God. And then God said, "Walk before me. and be ye perfect. Genesis 17:2 walk before me. In other words, let us have a continuous walk. Praise the name of our Lord. Don't depart from the word of God. Continue follow the word of God. Let us walk together. And then he influences you, changes your mind, changes your thinking, changes how you talk, changes how you make your decisions in every aspect of life. You would want to find out what is the will of God for [Music] like David here. Saul, God has told him do this. Saul is doing foolishly. Then then Samuel told God has looked for a man whose heart is like that of God. And he says he has found one. And that was David. We need to have the heart of God also. If we are going to build a heart of God with you, a heart that trembles at his word. Praise the name of Allah. You know the prophet Isaiah, &gt;&gt; God was asking, "What house will you build me?" Let us go and get that scripture. What house are you going to build me? How do you build a house of God? Praise the name of the Lord. Building a sure house. Praise the name of our Lord. How do we do it? Praise the name of the Lord. Let us get that scripture in the book of Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Let me get it here. Let me just just bear with me. Isaiah chapter 66. &gt;&gt; And then we go to verse one. &gt;&gt; He says, "Thus says the Lord, heaven is my throne and the earth is my foottool. Where is the house that you build unto me? And where is the place of my rest? Praise the name of the Lord. God is asking where will my dwelling be? What house are you going to build me? What materials are you going to use? I've made all the things. That's what the Lord is asking. Then he says in verse four, for all these things has mine hand made. And all those things have been says the Lord. So what house will you build to the Lord? Then he says, &gt;&gt; "Unto this man will I look, &gt;&gt; even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word. That's the house you build. says, "Have a contrite spirit. Have a broken heart. Tremble at the word of God." When you hear the word of God, you're not debating about it. You're not kind of in exchanging it for something else. How do you build your house? What house are you going to build for? But he says, "This is my design. If you hear my word and you tremble at my word, praise the name of the Lord. Like Abraham, he heard the word. He obeyed and followed. He trembled at the word of the Lord. David, he would not go and venture into a battle without asking the Lord, Lord, should I go ahead, what can I do at this condition? a man after God's own heart. And that should be the same thing with us that your heart is always desiring the things of God. You are building your house, a sure house formulated on what the Lord has instructed us to do. Praise the name of our Lord. Building a sure house. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message, God has a provided way. Brother Brennham says, &gt;&gt; he says, he says, "A few years ago, some normal modern witch doctors said witch doctors Let that baby cry. Don't pick it up. All things like that. Don't let grandma touch it. And you know what? They hatched out. You see what it is? A juvenile delquence. A bunch of neurotics. God made a baby to be loved. That's why he made the mother to love a baby. That's why we are supposed to be this way. God made it that way. And any time that you upset God's program, you must remember you are wrong and will be wrong. And as long as you're upsetting God's program, follow God's program. Do it the way God say do it. Praise the name of our Lord. Just follow what the Lord has said. That's what Abraham was doing. That's what David was doing. Then you are able to build a sure house. Praise the name of our Lord. You know storms will come, challenges will come and the message the world is falling apart. He says we want everything just everything so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy. Life wasn't intended to be easy. Life is a struggle. Anything that has got life is struggling. Look at the trees. How they struggle. Look at everything that has got life. It is a struggle. And when we try to get some kind of a system that takes it easy, then we are wrong. We know there is something wrong. Now just like the Bible say he built a house on the rock the storms came no storms are coming no manner know that storms are coming struggles of life come against your life against your family they keep on coming but how have you built your house. Have you built it on sand on earth that it cannot stand pressure? How are we raising our children? Praise the name of our Lord. You know like sometimes whatever they want you just give, you just give. How they learn patience. Praise the name of our Lord. But the children have to go through Okay, if I don't have this, can I be patient? Can I wait for another person? Like when they go to schools, can find somebody has another thing, the other has another thing and then they are meant to learn how to live with one another, how to live in a society. They're not going to live by themselves alone. But we live in a community, in a society, how are we raising our children? yourself. Praise the name of our Lord because challenges come. Joseph was loved by his father. But there are challenges Joseph faced. How did he handle those challenges, loved by the father, had a court of many colors. The brothers hated him. They sold him out. If he was raised badly, who would have failed in Egypt. But because the father had a character built in him, he was able to overcome in the challenges in Egypt. We need to build a sure house. The same thing with us. When the challenges of life come, is that the time I stop coming to church? Is that the time I switch off my phone? Is that the time I take off? How are you building your house? Praise the name of the Lord. How are we standing? Life is a struggle. So, you have to learn how to handle those challenges. When you are rejected once, it doesn't mean to be happening all the time. When they don't give you what you want, doesn't mean you have given up on that. &gt;&gt; And then there are some people at their places of work. You know they have challenges at place of work. But the challenges that they on which give you the job. If they are not there then why do you be employed? What user leave you there? But they are there and then you have to work. So life is a struggle. Challenges happen in life. But then you need to see that you do the right thing. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message impersonation of Christianity, he says, &gt;&gt; I said, I'll be so happy someday when I cross over to meet Joseph and shake his hand. See Daniel and ask him how he felt when he was in those lions down there. And the pillar of fire stood there and held those lions off the night long. See the Hebrew children, how they come out of the fairy furnish with that Pentecostal wind around them, railing around, keeping the breezes away. They had challenges they went through. Praise the name of our Lord. And sometimes those challenges come to prove where do you stand? They come in your life. They come in your family. They come at your place of work. They come in the community where you were prove how do you start? What really inspired you to this? What really attracted you to this? Praise the name of the Lord. And then he said, I said, what a wonderful time. I said, oh God, Now he was praying &gt;&gt; if you would ever give me a child I will call his name Joseph. See he was being actually influenced by a Bible example. That should be the same thing with us. Be influenced by a Bible character. Take time. Read about this character. Know more about it. Take interest. How did Joseph overcome that that stripping woman? How did Joseph overcome it? He didn't say I run. And he took off. And there are some of those things you just take off. For me, I'm strong. I can even go to the bar. I don't drink. &gt;&gt; I've abstained from appearance of all evil. Just leave where sin is and just go away than being sold into it. Praise the name of our Lord. So, we need to be influenced by the Bible characters. Let them influence our lives. Look at the examples. Jeroboam refused to look at David. He took his own way. But God had promised him. I'm going to build you a sure house. God fought his battles. But Jeroboam &gt;&gt; said, "No, these people when they go away from me, they are going to go back and serve Judah and then they will turn against me and kill me." So what did he do? As we finish in First Kings chapter 12 and then verse 25, &gt;&gt; he says, &gt;&gt; "Then Jeroboam built Sheckchum in Mount Ephraim and dwelt in there and went out from then and built Penel. And Jeroboam said in his heart, "Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David. So what did he do? He said in his heart, "Ah, these people, if I allow them to be going to Jerusalem to worship, they will turn against me." So he devised a device. And you know there are some people they deise a device they try to give you as if the reason is right but the motive behind is bad. You know this city is no longer a good city. Let us go and look somewhere else where we be able to build and have our own home. But the reason may be He's running away from church. We are going to be well off that side. But he's running away from church. Now for you blindly go here. So he was afraid in his heart and then he devises. You know you need to check your heart. Is your heart after God? Praise the name of our Lord. The decisions you are making, what is influencing you in those decision making? Because it is a spirit and as long as it is a spirit to bring to manifestation what exactly it is. Praise the name of the Lord to bring to manifestation. It will somehow come out but sometimes may come out when it is a lot of damage which has been done very hard to repair very hard to restore because you've been nursing a spirit over time you know okay before we continue with let me pick this scripture here &gt;&gt; in the book of first Corinthians Praise the name of our Lord. First Corinthians chapter 7 &gt;&gt; and then verse 33. The Bible says, "But he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. Now see the Bible says when you marry as a wife you're meant to please your husband. That's what the Bible is saying. When you marry as a husband you're meant to please your wife. And this where now the trouble comes in when the wife doesn't want to please the husband. Satan has options there. When the husband doesn't please the wife, Satan also comes there. He has alternatives. Like now some people are working the wife doesn't attend to the husband then you get those women who work colleagues then they will come and start what happened sorry they just remind you what your wife is failing but the wife is also busy in her thing. But then there are women showing concern. No, that is not good. But anyway, there's a place where the things can be made well. They giving ideas. They approaching us good Samaritans, good helpers and then the wife is there. For me, I'm a married wife with better what is going to to change you know and then the Satan is also preaching the other side the heart of the man is being stolen because there is a gap here the same thing with the wife the husband doesn't care then there are those serpents who come in the time of loneliness they come and start preaching gap. The husband is not pleasing the wife. The wife is not pleasing the husband. Then the serpent comes comes when you are lonely. Say no. There is this alternative. No. Now today you've been idle. Why don't you go and watch some of these films? You go to reading all the time. He comes, he gives alternatives. Now, your husband has not called you the whole week. I don't know what's happening to him. the children of Israel after giving them the law on the mountain, Moses goes to God to bring down the the tables of stone and the instructions how they can worship and then they say we don't know what has become of Moses. Then the devil started preaching. Satan began to stand the same thing was doing here. And then the Bible says in 2 Coronicles and chapter 15 and verse three. Praise the name of the Lord. The Bible says &gt;&gt; now for a long season Israel has been without the true God. The question is you mean God was not there. God was not God was there but God was not their interest. So they were without God a long season. And your life can be put in that kind of mess for the whole day you walked without God. You've left him at home. And then some people for the whole week without God left him in the church &gt;&gt; like Mary &gt;&gt; left Jesus in Jerusalem. for a whole day and now they discovered it the following day. &gt;&gt; And people get discovered when they in troubles. Why is this thing happening but a long season without God? And then the Bible says and without a teaching priest. But there was the tribe of Le who were ordained to be priests. But what had happened? They had rejected them. Jeroboam had put them off their work and put people not meant to be priests. So they were without a teaching and without the law. Everybody had the lo books and tables of but they said we have closed our ears. We no longer think of we want things that go. We want things of this age. That's what the devil does. God was there. The priests were there. The law was there. But that was not their business. So they were without God in the priesthood without the Lord. That can be somebody's condition in your life. You are without God in your family. You are without God. Things happen anyhow. You don't care what the word of God say. You are without the word. You don't care what God says. You are without God. You just what my home that's not what rules my life &gt;&gt; without God without the law without the priesthood without you make serious decisions without asking let me consult let me find out from the pastor there's this thing I'm thinking about how can I go about this they had put them aside that's the business of Jeroboah so now let us go back to first kings chapter 12 and then verse 28 okay verse yes verse 28 he says &gt;&gt; whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought you out of the land of Egypt. [Music] Now we see these are your gods and make sure that they are near them. He put one of them in and another in Bethl. Now it is easy simplified things. You see the things of marrying I just get from outside we are no longer struggling made things easy but there's a problem trouble coming let me do PCM I'll just tell her you just wait for some time but troubles along the road. &gt;&gt; You may want to turn it difficult like in the wilderness. So the Bible says and he set one in and then he said he set one in Bethl and the other in Dan. And the thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before one, even unto Dan. taken them away from God. He has given them an alternative. So this is what you need to do. Like they tell me in Japan their God is work. Until that country is not an issue, it's about work. until the government they have realized that there are more people dying than those who are being born and there are more older people than the young ones. So they said now we are going to be giving you some allowances to socialize. You go you go and you know do so you can have more children. [Music] Because they are finding they have no future but they are God is work. So all the time they on that on that an alternative. So the Bible says and he made a house of high places and made priests of the lowest of the people which were not of the sons of Levi. Jeroboam. He had an opportunity for God to build him a shower house, a kingdom that is established like the kingdom of David. But Satan corrupted his mind. until he wanted to do things the way of the world and destruction just came upon his family and upon the kingdom of Israel. Let us build a sure house. Praise the name of our Lord. See that you do it like like Abraham. The Bible says of Abraham in Genesis chapter 18, praise the name of our Lord. Genesis chapter 18 and then verse 18 and 19. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; let us start from verse 17. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" You know the Bible says the secret of God is with them that fear him. When you fear God, he will show you things. Even things about your life, what you need to do, even things about your family because you fear God. So he takes interest in your life. He takes interest in your family. He takes interest in your place of work. Praise the name of our Lord. So God had promised Abraham and said, "I have to tell Abraham what I'm going to do." Why? Because Abraham shall be a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. Like now we can say that was now the a finished house that was the target of God. One should become of Abraham. Then how will Abraham from the land of the child to the time of being a father of many nations and allow us to be blessed of him? How is that house going to be built? Allow God to be your coworker. Walk along with him. Walk before God in your life. Walk before God in your family. Walk before God. Everything you do, walk before God and then you see the blessings of God one at a time guiding you in this direction. When you reach a junction and you don't know what to do, God is right there to point you where to turn. Pray in the name of Lord. Don't use the world to make you tire. Don't use the friends make you tire. Let therations don't make you tire. But say, "Lord, I'm here. I am stuck here like he reached the well. What next? What should I do? I'm at the well. Humbled himself. He said, "Lord, I'm at the well where the daughters of men come to draw. It's not only one person, but it's a communal well." So he says, "Lord, but guide me." God revealed to Elza the girl you're going to tell give me water to drink and he gives you water to drink and then afterwards you have not told her to give the animals then she starts giving the animals that is the girl I've chosen for Isa had the secret in his heart so then he waited &gt;&gt; and then Rebecca comes oh give me to drink. She was not those girls. You're an old man. What business you have to do with me? &gt;&gt; Daddy, why do you want to to talk to me? &gt;&gt; You know, she was humble enough. You know, there are those you just talk to the first time and sparks. So, she humbled herself. She gave him water and then she went and fished for the animal. He stood at the junction and the Lord made him turn right. Praise the name of the Lord. So Abraham also God is saying I know in verse 19 for I know Abraham &gt;&gt; that he will command his children and his Genesis 18:19 and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him. How could God make it to pass what God has spoken to Abraham? Abraham, he had to follow the word of God. Abraham, he had to teach his children the word of the Lord. He had to teach his household the way of the Lord. He was building a How are you building your house? Praise the name of our Lord. How are you building your house? Abraham taught Isaac how to sacrifice. In Genesis 22, Isaac was asking the father, "Father, there is fire here, there is firewood. But where is the lamb sacrifice?" He knew because the father had taught him. How about you? Have you taught your children the way of the Lord? Praise the name of the Lord. How are you building your house? We need to build sure houses as a family. You need to build a shower house. Why would all the goodness end on you not come to your children, not come to your grandchildren? When the Bible says, praise the name of our Lord, that a wise man, you know, he lives an inheritance for his grandchildren. That's what the Bible says. The Bible says, "A good man," Proverbs 13:22, "A good man lives an inheritance to his children's children. And for you, what have you passed on? Everything just died with like generations destroyed. Nothing more to continue. We need to build a sure house. Obey the word of God. Follow the instructions of God. Walk in the light. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us be the light of the world. May God bless you. Amen. Amen. Let us sing that song. We walk in the light as the song leader comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; So next Sunday we shall have two services and God willing in the afternoon next Sunday I believe we shall have a prayer line preaching then prayer line after next Sunday. Or you can come with your requests. You can come with your people prayers. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We walk in the light. Beautiful light.

Lord, we are so thankful, heavenly father, for your word that has come to teach us.
