[0:45] unconditional our
[0:48] condition so father each time we come
[0:52] before you we've come to the presence of

[1:15] Liberty to express ourselves before

[1:21] tonight in a special way in Jesus name
[1:26] amen amen so we thank God for this
[1:30] service
[1:32] today it's going to be a very short
[1:36] one but the Lord be gracious and bless
[1:41] us so Genesis chter
[1:45] one verse
[1:48] 27 that's where we are springing
[1:52] from and I like these coup
[1:58] meetings amen
[2:00] me verse 27 so God created man in his
[2:05] own
[2:09] image in the image of God created he
[2:16] him and female created
[2:20] he so God blessed
[2:24] them
[2:26] created
[2:27] blessed created
[2:30] blessed and God blessed them
[2:36] saying be
[2:39] fruitful and
[2:42] multiply and the
[2:45] Earth and subdue
[2:47] it and and
[2:51] and and have dominion over the fish of
[2:54] the
[2:56] sea and and and
[3:00] and over the fall of the
[3:01] air and and and and
[3:06] everything every living thing that move
[3:10] upon you see it is a chain of
[3:15] blessing
[3:18] and you get into this and you get into
[3:23] this what a blessing God bless you you
[3:27] may be seated
[3:31] it's a
[3:33] chain and the chain is one link leading
[3:36] it to
[3:42] another okay so for the title
[3:47] tonight I want to speak about's
[3:53] wom's
[3:54] womb a
[3:56] womb is that area
[4:00] in a
[4:01] woman where a child is
[4:05] developed amen so a man does not have a
[4:16] wom much as he has a
[4:19] stomach he does not have a
[4:27] womb so very poor
[4:33] sometimes but a man doesn't have a
[4:38] womb we've got here maybe they can
[4:45] explain what is the
[5:08] so I think that's the
[5:14] area Adam
[5:30] so God created
[5:35] man as a
[5:38] unit he was
[5:40] male and
[5:42] female and called their name
[5:46] Adam but then he gave man in that single
[5:53] unit to
[5:55] be fruitful
[6:01] blessed and as I was speaking about the
[6:04] joints and blessing and
[6:09] blessing so being
[6:12] fruitful
[6:14] is the Capac to multiply the
[6:20] blessing amen that's being
[6:24] fruitful you have the capacity to
[6:26] multiply
[6:30] amen am and so Adam and
[6:36] Eve that unit not Adam and Eve but Adam
[6:40] in that
[6:43] unit he was
[6:46] blessed and he would
[6:49] multiply and then he
[6:52] carried that blessing with
[6:57] him even in the time when he was made
[7:05] flesh and even you know he was
[7:08] still carrying the sem with
[7:13] him that he had when he was still a
[7:16] spirit
[7:19] being in the natural he still could
[7:24] multiply he could
[7:27] replenish he could sub
[7:30] could have
[7:32] dominion now the blessing of
[7:36] God works like
[7:41] that you know which would come from a
[7:44] caterpillar to to it just keeps changing
[7:52] form the moment it comes into the first
[7:57] form it is sure that to enter into the
[8:00] second
[8:02] form enter into the third
[8:05] form and also this the way God had
[8:08] blessed Abraham I mean
[8:12] Adam that as long Adam was in the
[8:15] original
[8:19] form character and nature where God
[8:21] blessed
[8:24] him he would be
[8:26] fruitful and the moment is fruitful
[8:31] then he would also
[8:34] multiply he would also replenish the
[8:37] Earth he would also subdue it and he
[8:40] would even have
[8:42] dominion because that blessing was one
[8:45] joint into another another
[8:51] another but then for Adam to
[8:56] multiply in the natural aspect
[9:00] he needed his
[9:03] wom amen he needed his
[9:08] womb so we find
[9:11] out that in Genesis Chapter
[9:15] 2 Verse
[9:17] 18 God says I'll make him a help me for
[9:25] him where was that help
[9:29] that help
[9:31] me was a part of the unit that Adam
[9:38] was Adam being a spirit
[9:42] being and so when God made
[9:47] Adam and gave him a
[9:50] body to te the
[9:52] Earth that unit was dressed in that body
[9:59] but while in that
[10:01] body God says I'll give him a help
[10:05] meat so she was called help me for
[10:10] Adam to plant all the seeds of his
[10:16] mind because he was a
[10:18] teacher are you together with me he was
[10:22] a teacher and Eve was the
[10:26] church so Adam had had a work or an
[10:33] assignment to develop the character and
[10:38] nature of his
[10:42] [Music]
[10:43] wife now it's a responsibility of every
[10:48] man to design his
[10:57] wife okay because brother
[11:02] Bram in uh the
[11:06] message Mar and
[11:09] voice he made a very powerful
[11:13] statement which you can understand by
[11:17] virtue of
[11:20] Revelation he says that the devil was
[11:24] her designer
[11:29] and many people
[11:32] wonder how could have the devil been the
[11:35] designer
[11:38] of you see because the
[11:41] devil took over the work of Adam at a
[11:44] certain
[11:47] point where Adam was supposed to be the
[11:52] S of the seeds of
[11:56] his into this woman
[12:00] that whatsoever she was going to
[12:02] do she was going to do the
[12:06] will of Adam which was the
[12:10] will of God are you together with me so
[12:15] he had s the
[12:17] SE of the understanding of
[12:21] God and by S
[12:24] doing Adam would be designing his wife
[12:29] amen design the way she would
[12:33] dress design the way she would
[12:36] work the way she would raise her
[12:39] children all those seeds had to be
[12:43] planted into the mind of
[12:47] Eve are you together with me so it's
[12:51] exactly the same
[12:54] responsibility that when a man is going
[12:57] to marry
[13:00] he should have in his
[13:03] mind what a wife
[13:05] is and that when he finds one that meets
[13:10] his
[13:14] grace then he would do one
[13:17] thing he would start to design
[13:21] her are you together with me the word
[13:27] designs the word
[13:31] designs and when Adam didn't do
[13:36] it then the
[13:38] devil was her
[13:41] designer do you understand that yeah
[13:44] many people feel so bad about the
[13:49] statement but the
[13:51] devil designed
[13:54] her because you know she opened the of
[13:59] our
[14:00] church to a strange
[14:07] teacher the teacher was
[14:10] Adam and the church was
[14:13] Eve and you know this principles once we
[14:16] follow
[14:18] them they teach us how to leave as
[14:22] church and they teach us how to live as
[14:26] family so for us to have a productive
[14:33] family we have to have the same
[14:38] principle the man must have the right
[14:40] seeds of the
[14:43] word to plant in the womb of his
[14:47] wife to get the right kind of
[14:51] mother to raise his
[14:55] children because this woman
[14:57] here was
[14:59] Adam's
[15:02] womb when God told
[15:05] Adam that
[15:07] reproduce Adam could not have that
[15:11] capacity he needed a
[15:15] womb to raise the
[15:17] children so Adam
[15:20] here his womb was
[15:26] in you are there with me
[15:29] so when you get your
[15:34] wife there are so many things that you
[15:37] start picturing in the Journey of your
[15:42] walk with your
[15:48] wife you begin to sell your
[15:52] designer you begin to see how you are
[15:54] going to be satisfied which wish she
[15:58] should drink
[16:02] you begin to picture what kind of
[16:04] friends she would
[16:08] have you begin to picture what children
[16:11] you should
[16:13] have and you what kind of children
[16:15] should they
[16:17] be so it's a long journey of your
[16:22] mind and as you travel this long
[16:26] journey I take a junction
[16:30] you should allow this
[16:33] blessing to open up into the next Chanel
[16:37] of the
[16:40] bless are you together with me multiply
[16:44] I mean be
[16:46] fruitful and once you are
[16:49] fruitful in the physical
[16:51] room it is
[16:53] children amen and then
[16:57] replenish mean that now you are getting
[17:00] one after
[17:03] another give me
[17:06] Genesis so that we can be able to
[17:10] understand
[17:12] marriage starts on the
[17:15] day of your
[17:17] wedding when you choose really rather
[17:20] maybe a little
[17:24] back begins with your vow
[17:29] amen I think uh let's start with
[17:33] genesis8
[17:37] first let's go
[17:42] there right
[17:48] there let me get back to my praise the
[17:52] Lord so yeah 28 rather not 18
[18:00] forgive this old mind
[18:05] here and God blessed
[18:08] them and God said unto
[18:12] them be
[18:15] fruitful being
[18:18] fruitful is a
[18:22] potential to produce
[18:26] fruit he's not saying bring forth
[18:30] fruit he saying
[18:33] be I'm blessing you with the
[18:38] potential but when you step
[18:41] forward because you are
[18:44] fruitful and then you bring forth a
[18:47] child you already stepping into
[18:51] multiplication then you are
[18:54] replenishing amen then you are going to
[18:57] sub the Earth
[18:59] one step after
[19:03] another now that means that when
[19:08] God promes a
[19:11] blessing and you put there your first
[19:14] food it means that you have believed
[19:18] God then it's God who lift the next
[19:23] foot and put it in the next
[19:26] chain of the blessing
[19:30] okay I want you to understand this
[19:32] fairly
[19:34] well that God gives you a
[19:37] family and then as I said the moment you
[19:41] make your
[19:44] vow you've ceased to kind of uh uh
[19:49] trying to to cut her
[20:05] amen so everything is
[20:09] settled there is the
[20:12] future then you start talking about the
[20:16] house you start talking about
[20:20] children you are not continuing saying
[20:23] will you marry
[20:24] me that one is certain you are going
[20:28] over to the
[20:29] next you are talking real
[20:32] things the journey has
[20:36] started and then the children
[20:39] come it's just a
[20:41] beginning so in that particular
[20:46] instance the husband doesn't give
[20:52] up because he has been wed at the church
[20:59] and he says I
[21:01] do until
[21:04] death actually that
[21:07] vow is trying to
[21:10] say now have you been
[21:14] officially presented to
[21:17] me as my
[21:22] field I'm going to S the mind of God
[21:28] into the
[21:29] womb of your
[21:32] mind you are trying to get the picture
[21:35] you
[21:37] want and that picture is produced by the
[21:42] word you are talking about a wonderful
[21:47] wife who will make a beautiful
[21:50] home who will give you wonderful
[21:53] children you don't just wait at the
[21:56] wedding
[21:58] and after you've done that you go
[22:02] home you are not going to get what you
[22:06] want God made Adam and
[22:10] Eve and demanded from
[22:13] them he demanded from
[22:16] Adam to have a
[22:18] child Amen to reproduce
[22:21] himself and then that was going to be by
[22:27] Adam but Adam in a
[22:30] way at a
[22:32] point there was a
[22:34] [Applause]
[22:37] lapse and in
[22:40] that another
[22:42] farmer so in his
[22:47] father he sold something in the mind
[22:52] of amen and yet this
[22:56] e was B
[23:00] suppos to
[23:02] beam's
[23:05] wom's
[23:07] field she was called helpmate
[23:13] for I where seeds to design a good
[23:18] woman was supposed to be
[23:21] planted so once you appreciate
[23:25] her in the time of your courtship
[23:30] that's just step number
[23:33] one there is Step number
[23:35] two which is a daily continuous
[23:40] job so that you may
[23:43] continue as her
[23:46] teacher like a Christ when he found his
[23:51] church in her
[23:53] election and chose
[23:56] her that was not all
[23:59] it is a continuous
[24:02] work the church became a
[24:06] fi of the
[24:08] master so that the
[24:10] master
[24:13] that he can get a
[24:16] child in the image of the Father the St
[24:21] of a perfect
[24:22] man it's not something he does one
[24:26] day it's a
[24:30] so fellow in a
[24:33] home between a husband and
[24:36] wife is something that is
[24:39] constant Whenever there is a
[24:42] lapse the devil can plant a seed
[24:47] ofation
[24:49] amen he had to
[24:52] develop to the stage of Oneness of mind
[24:59] Amen Let the
[25:02] mind that was in Christ be in you the
[25:07] bride you together to me amen he was the
[25:11] teacher she was the church she was the
[25:15] ground she was
[25:17] growing towards the
[25:19] head so for us to have a productive
[25:24] family we must have the same principle
[25:28] the
[25:29] man must have the right seeds of the
[25:33] word to plant in the womb of his
[25:36] wife to get the right kind of
[25:40] mother raise his
[25:47] children is
[26:02] are you together with me yeah that's the
[26:05] relationship of husband and
[26:08] wife but if a man comes to
[26:12] you and
[26:15] says there is problem
[26:29] she left
[26:31] those she accepted to be where you
[26:35] are the problem you stop sewing
[26:38] seeds and in the
[26:41] morning
[26:43] exaltation with long
[26:51] suffer why didn't they give up in cour
[27:08] you understand what
[27:15] I finally it goes into the
[27:28] once you get to the right
[27:30] spot then something has been
[27:34] planted and then she begins to think
[27:38] different she begins to
[27:41] ask but why did come to
[27:45] Mar why am I behaving like
[27:48] this you see what I mean yeah with long
[27:54] suffering you are trying to make your
[27:57] form
[28:00] amen out of your wife you plant this
[28:04] seed you plant that seed you PL the
[28:07] other SE and then the people start
[28:10] saying she's not what she used to
[28:13] do when she came here she was a
[28:17] different woman that man is a good
[28:20] family he knows the seeds
[28:24] to you don't only s the natural seed
[28:29] to get the children out of
[28:31] her but also to get the right mother in
[28:37] that
[28:39] mind the fth gospel of your
[28:44] children because a
[28:47] sister who is very
[28:49] impatient will raise the
[28:52] children patient
[28:58] so you know what
[29:04] areas because you live with her in the
[29:08] morning in the afternoon in the evening
[29:12] through the night you know what areas to
[29:15] work
[29:20] with it's just like the
[29:23] church the Lord found
[29:26] us we accepted
[29:29] yes but we had so many rust
[29:36] areas some of them taken him 10
[29:40] years but to be a
[29:43] husband is not to give
[29:46] up you are trying to work around your
[29:51] womb because you don't have another
[29:54] woman you are trying to work in such a
[29:57] way
[29:59] that you may cause this
[30:02] lady the womb which God gave
[30:05] you to respect her own
[30:09] wom so we have fights in our
[30:13] families because we are not
[30:17] ready when the children came we were not
[30:21] ready the children came in when the womb
[30:25] was not properly designed
[30:29] we spent all these
[30:30] times all these years all these
[30:36] months for ad to get to fulfill the
[30:41] promise of being
[30:44] fruitful there had to be a
[30:47] separation between male and female that
[30:51] the male might have a
[30:55] womb to raise the promise
[31:00] are you together with me so let the
[31:03] young woman
[31:06] understand what it means to be a
[31:09] wife you are not just the dominant
[31:13] [Applause]
[31:14] figure no a dominant you are not the
[31:18] dominant
[31:20] figure amen because you will help
[31:25] me amen that's the reason where you
[31:29] came you don't become a dominant
[31:33] figure because you are Adam's
[31:36] womb you are Adam's
[31:39] field he s in you the seeds of the
[31:44] world you receive them because it's this
[31:48] man who has the vision of the kind of
[31:52] family he wants to
[31:54] have God has blessed you
[31:58] to be the ground that will raise those
[32:02] children so you sanctify
[32:05] yourself for the job that God called you
[32:08] to that
[32:11] family to be a beding
[32:15] ground amen and the
[32:18] female will be
[32:22] destroyed when she marries a
[32:25] male that doesn't have any seed
[32:32] she's just in a
[32:34] house when she was the eggs are
[32:42] there when she wants to get some beef
[32:45] the meat is
[32:47] there when she wants to eat some chicken
[32:50] the meat is
[32:52] there the man is working there and
[32:56] night but he has
[32:58] forgotten that apart from making her
[33:01] physically
[33:04] happy he has a right and
[33:08] responsibility to prepare as a
[33:14] mother so you find that some of these
[33:19] sisters they get
[33:22] destroyed as
[33:24] fi because they mared it areas
[33:28] where the man has no seed to
[33:31] plant he doesn't even understand the
[33:35] godhead he doesn't know what it means to
[33:38] be a
[33:39] man he doesn't know what it means a
[33:42] woman to be a
[33:46] woman and as unprepared as they
[33:50] are the biolog does
[33:54] CH the child will come and the mother is
[33:58] not
[33:59] ready the child doesn't have
[34:04] gospel because the man sold
[34:07] nothing in that home you always hear
[34:11] kids
[34:13] crying because they are raising them on
[34:18] sticks the children don't know what to
[34:21] do we know that in raising of the ship
[34:24] of the sheep fall
[34:28] the the shepherd would go ahead of the
[34:32] ship and the ship would
[34:35] fall that's Christ and the
[34:37] church husband and wife what have you
[34:41] sown in that
[34:42] family for them to walk after
[34:47] you then the children will try to go in
[34:53] front but they don't know where to
[34:55] go and that's now when you start
[34:58] [Applause]
[35:01] King because there was no
[35:05] seeds that was sown in
[35:08] there to prepare for the moment where
[35:10] you
[35:14] are are you together with me she will
[35:17] not know where to place her
[35:20] hand
[35:22] amen because you saw no seing her
[35:27] and then the next
[35:29] thing she becomes a smart
[35:34] lady because
[35:36] need always
[35:40] dictates she try to occupy your
[35:45] position simply because you did so
[35:48] no and then the next thing you start
[35:52] running to
[35:53] church the woman is becoming the head of
[35:56] the of the home
[35:59] she's now
[36:00] dominant she tells me this she sees an

[41:03] kind of child he wanted to
[41:06] have and as a Christian that's the same
[41:09] principle and the same basis you may not
[41:13] be
[41:14] able to create them the same way God
[41:17] created you into his own image in a
[41:20] particular way but you should have a

[41:48] preached and she doesn't
[41:51] understand God knows that there is a
[41:54] special bond
[41:57] between husband and
[42:00] wife she was told to go
[42:03] back and ask husband at
[42:07] home except for sister
[42:13] har praise the Lord but you know the
[42:17] reason way God created the husband and
[42:21] wife the Ison way wife will be able to

[42:28] [Music]
[42:31] oh and then sistera will say I tell you
[42:35] brother
[42:41] PR I him once understand
[42:45] everything yeah that's what it should
[42:49] be she has told you from A to
[42:53] Z so she just say this was this when I
[42:57] said this yeah then this is
[43:03] this
[43:05] not so God gave
[43:09] you a
[43:11] womb
[43:12] spiritual
[43:14] physical plant the seeds of the
[43:17] world design your
[43:19] wife for the spiritual
[43:22] seed Adam was the
[43:25] teacher and for the natural seed
[43:28] Adam was supposed to be the
[43:31] planter are you together with me but in
[43:35] that unguarded
[43:38] moment listen to what brother Bram
[43:41] say a woman in the
[43:43] beginning he took the woman from
[43:48] Adam and Adam and
[43:50] wife are really W but that was done to
[43:56] reproduce
[43:58] themselves
[44:00] again to put them in
[44:02] flesh but he took the femin part of the
[44:08] man and made the woman of
[44:11] it Hallelujah
[44:13] hallel
[44:15] Adam go and
[44:18] reproduce by the way the
[44:21] womb is in you let me remove it and put
[44:27] it
[44:29] here are you together with
[44:32] me sister Juliet sister
[44:38] brother
[44:39] [Music]
[44:42] your
[44:44] brother just you
[44:48] my you see those are
[44:51] teachers and that's what they do to
[44:53] children ATO
[44:58] praise the Lord listen to this other
[45:01] quote the first
[45:04] son Adam was the spoken seed word of
[45:10] God he was given a
[45:14] bride to reproduce
[45:17] himself amen that's why the bride was
[45:21] given to
[45:22] him to reproduce
[45:25] himself to reproduce another Son of
[45:30] God so now we are talking about the
[45:35] woman was given to Adam that Adam May
[45:40] reproduce
[45:43] himself by way of the
[45:45] womb of his wife but then this Adam is
[45:51] reproducing his
[45:53] nature that's what the scripture says
[45:56] reprod
[45:58] himself so he knew who he
[46:01] was and he knew
[46:03] what he needed to put in Eve as a mother
[46:10] to raise his
[46:12] child His
[46:15] Image okay now the
[46:20] serpent robed both WS
[46:27] when he took
[46:28] Eve in that secret
[46:31] moment he had stolen both
[46:35] WS he had taken the spiritual
[46:39] women of her
[46:41] mind and the moment he stole
[46:44] it he was able to get the
[46:51] natural are you together with it so the
[46:53] mind is so powerful
[46:57] but he was a
[46:58] husband you must be sewing the right
[47:01] seads in your husband's mind I mean your
[47:04] wife's
[47:06] mind because when the devil got the
[47:10] man he was able to get the
[47:13] body he also robbed the natural
[47:16] womb and planted a cane in
[47:20] there but it all
[47:23] started when Eve sought for knowledge
[47:31] are you together
[47:32] with it's very
[47:35] important for husband and wife to always
[47:39] have valuable
[47:42] communication if anything ever
[47:45] comes into your family that you cannot
[47:50] communicate that's a very dangerous
[47:55] moment no Man was
[47:58] created that he cannot have
[48:02] Fellowship If you deny your wife
[48:06] Fellowship that's very
[48:10] dangerous you can get
[48:13] upset but never
[48:15] choose to keep quiet on your wife or to
[48:19] keep quiet on your
[48:22] husband you know
[48:33] she's chewing but she
[48:35] doesn't that's not a Christian
[48:38] way and let me tell you that
[48:42] person is not feeling that one
[48:46] everybody only one
[48:49] person his
[48:51] wife his
[48:54] husb the rest of the people
[48:57] they laugh and they talk that's opening
[49:01] up a
[49:02] mind at that time anything but can be
[49:07] planted in the
[49:09] M keep Fellowship
[49:13] open it's very important for husband and
[49:17] wife to maintain valuable
[49:22] communication wives should not make
[49:25] decisions in life
[49:29] whether big or
[49:32] small outside of the knowledge of the
[49:36] husband you see I was having fellowship
[49:39] with brother
[49:43] Andreas this thing called the
[49:46] mind is a very terrible
[49:49] thing very
[49:51] tell and let me tell
[49:55] you the greatest ever
[49:59] fault brother Bram says it's fault in
[50:02] the
[50:06] man that's where now you have your
[50:12] battles
[50:14] so this is what
[50:18] happened the
[50:21] woman has decided take a lonely walk
[50:27] it was not
[50:31] normal and there was a
[50:33] serent who was the head
[50:37] prefect of all the
[50:39] ad because he was more
[50:42] sub all the animals of the field he was
[50:46] the head boy he knew the geograph of the
[50:50] farm he knew where to
[50:53] stand because Eve was going to pass that
[50:59] and the worst
[51:02] thing was Eve opening
[51:06] up just to talk to The
[51:09] Serpent and the serpent said certain
[51:13] things we are a mixed crowd
[51:17] here
[51:19] but the devil aimed at
[51:24] the that if I get
[51:27] mind I can get to her
[51:30] soul to her
[51:35] womb so while he says the Lord say
[51:39] should not
[51:41] eat says yeah not even to touch then the
[51:47] the serpent says do you know
[51:51] why because when you eat you'll be like
[51:55] a god knowing good and
[51:58] bad and then says okay okay I think I
[52:03] want to
[52:07] know and the CH
[52:09] open but it was so
[52:12] powerful that if could not close that
[52:18] chel are you together with me the
[52:21] channel was so
[52:24] powerful that it opened up the the
[52:26] hormones of her
[52:31] body she has been with Adam all the
[52:36] time and those kind of negative hormons
[52:39] had never been
[52:41] released but for the first
[52:45] time behaved in a certain
[52:48] way and
[52:53] theil that's how dangerous it is
[52:57] sometimes once you open up your
[53:00] mind you are going to
[53:03] fight but it's so hard to close your
[53:08] mind after you opened it for the
[53:11] devil you open up your
[53:13] mind and you want to hear certain
[53:16] things that brother the thief is Wizard
[53:22] is actually this you try to do your best
[53:27] and tell that brother go
[53:30] Bless but you opened up a
[53:34] child the devil knows that the moment he
[53:38] gets your
[53:41] mind he can be able to get
[53:44] the there's a lot of negative
[53:48] things which go around we open up our
[53:52] minds and we may never get healed out of
[53:55] them
[53:59] that's Mr Lucifer Lucifer that's how he
[54:04] works all of a
[54:07] sudden if could handle her
[54:11] body she wondered why she opened up her
[54:17] mind so even if you are seeking for
[54:22] ccel from your past on between husband
[54:27] and
[54:29] wife it is always so good for both of
[54:33] you to be
[54:37] there are you together with me yeah
[54:40] because the pastor will hear it this
[54:44] way and will give her a
[54:48] judgment based on how she told the
[54:52] story and now that gets into her mind
[54:56] sett
[54:58] in
[55:04] ands HB
[55:07] any
[55:11] me brothers are you there Genesis
[55:17] 2:25 the scripture
[55:19] says and they were both
[55:25] naked the man and his
[55:28] wife and were not
[55:31] ashamed they were in an inocent
[55:36] world but after
[55:38] that the
[55:43] Mind open up
[55:47] AEL
[55:49] and began to think and act different
[55:56] but before
[55:58] that they were both
[56:00] naked and were not
[56:03] ashamed they had nothing to
[56:06] hide they were open one to
[56:10] another we should not give one
[56:13] opportunity to a third
[56:16] hand in our
[56:18] [Music]
[56:19] marriages amen the serpent was the third
[56:25] hand and opened
[56:28] channels that even the teacher
[56:31] Adam could not
[56:36] close so that allow third Channel I me
[56:42] third to open the mind of your
[56:47] wife sometimes you will never be able to
[56:51] close let us keep the bond of our
[56:54] marriages
[56:56] let us be open one to
[56:59] another if you are
[57:02] broke be open about it and when you have
[57:06] the
[57:07] money be open about
[57:09] it amen are you together with me and let
[57:14] us keep both
[57:16] wombs the spiritual
[57:19] womb amen and the
[57:22] natural in the natural marriages here
[57:26] amen you've got a sacred
[57:32] commitment to your
[57:34] husband and as a bride you've got a
[57:37] sacred virtue to
[57:40] protect as the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[57:48] Christ now when God created the
[57:54] woman he created her
[57:57] in such a
[57:58] way that she was supposed to give a man
[58:04] child and also the
[58:11] child are you together with me I've
[58:14] always been
[58:22] wondering why he say
[58:26] they shall be
[58:30] saved in child
[58:34] bearing brother bham tried to touch
[58:38] it but he
[58:40] couldn't get to the bottom of
[58:45] it when they were writing
[58:48] scripture
[58:50] sometimes they were dealing with the
[58:53] character that was in the SE in the time
[58:57] the scripture was being
[59:03] written
[59:05] now
[59:07] in the Gentile Temple
[59:13] worship there were
[59:19] priestesses and these were virgins
[59:26] and they stayed right
[59:28] there as Temple
[59:33] priestesses they never
[59:36] married so Paul
[59:39] writes to
[59:40] Timothy no let our
[59:44] sisters be married they even be
[59:48] saved in
[59:53] child he was trying to abrace
[59:57] about that he
[1:00:00] custom that if you are so
[1:00:04] spiritual I will not
[1:00:07] marry he says no they'll be saved even
[1:00:12] in child so now you understand
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:19] that's are you together with me yeah so
[1:00:23] when you marry wife
[1:00:26] the honor of every
[1:00:28] woman is the ability to give a man a
[1:00:34] child if a child doesn't
[1:00:37] come it's just
[1:00:40] unfortunate but every
[1:00:42] mother the desire is to give a man a
[1:00:50] child and
[1:00:52] sisters you are the Ws
[1:00:56] to give a man a I mean a
[1:00:59] child and to have the
[1:01:02] ability to nure that
[1:01:06] child as a first
[1:01:09] teacher in the formative
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:14] years the husband marries his
[1:01:17] wife Des to the character of a
[1:01:21] mother the mother gets her child
[1:01:26] natur and gives
[1:01:29] basis of a faithful child to
[1:01:34] God because women have got a very strong
[1:01:39] influence over both their husbands and
[1:01:41] their
[1:01:44] children she can be an
[1:01:47] influence for the better for the
[1:01:53] wor so the question is
[1:01:57] sister I mean
[1:01:59] brother have you sown the right
[1:02:03] seat to design the character of your
[1:02:08] wife if you have
[1:02:11] done sister sister are you going to
[1:02:16] be the first positive teacher for your
[1:02:20] child
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:28] you are a very strong
[1:02:31] influence look at
[1:02:35] zakas
[1:02:38] wife and her name was
[1:02:40] re she had a powerful
[1:02:44] influence over
[1:02:46] zakas and compelled
[1:02:49] zakas to see
[1:02:52] Jesus are you going to be the kind of
[1:02:54] wife
[1:02:57] or you are going to be the kind of
[1:02:59] wife that will try to separate your
[1:03:04] husband from the influence of your
[1:03:08] pastor you are a powerful
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:14] influence are you together with
[1:03:16] me the prophet says little old zakas in
[1:03:21] the
[1:03:23] Bible his wife Rebecca
[1:03:26] she was a follower of the Lord
[1:03:29] Jesus it was her
[1:03:32] influence that helped bring him down
[1:03:36] there we are told by
[1:03:39] history she wanted
[1:03:41] zakas to believe Jesus so
[1:03:45] much that he was a prophet and she told
[1:03:49] him
[1:03:50] honey that man is a
[1:03:53] prophet I have seen him stand
[1:03:57] there and perceive their
[1:04:01] hearts now look the
[1:04:03] scripture he has exactly vated
[1:04:07] here are you together with me what kind
[1:04:11] of
[1:04:12] wife are
[1:04:17] you are you a good beding
[1:04:23] ground are the kind of wife
[1:04:27] that will bring your husband closer to
[1:04:31] church or you are the kind of
[1:04:34] wife that will separate her from
[1:04:41] church brothers are you
[1:04:45] there women
[1:04:47] are Pilot's Wife was
[1:04:52] powerful his wife sent to him
[1:04:56] when he was in the
[1:04:58] courtroom and he was trying to judge and
[1:05:01] sentence
[1:05:03] Jesus and he says have nothing to do
[1:05:08] with that just
[1:05:10] man I have suffered many things this
[1:05:14] day in a dream because of
[1:05:17] him and
[1:05:19] pilot pulled
[1:05:21] back the
[1:05:23] power of a woman
[1:05:28] are you positive
[1:05:30] power or negative
[1:05:34] power talk about
[1:05:39] herodia
[1:05:41] herodia
[1:05:45] Herod was wife to
[1:05:47] Philip who was a brother to
[1:05:51] Herod
[1:05:54] Herod amen
[1:05:56] fin
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:09] Mar I think when
[1:06:18] phod I am
[1:06:21] Herod I should have married Herod
[1:06:29] and he went and took him away from his
[1:06:32] brother and she was a very strong
[1:06:35] influence over
[1:06:37] Herod negative
[1:06:40] influence and he caused the
[1:06:43] death of John the
[1:06:46] Baptist her daughter Dan in herod's
[1:06:50] [Applause]
[1:06:51] birthday and for a word
[1:06:55] just for the Baptist
[1:06:59] head you know she
[1:07:02] danced went to the
[1:07:04] king and the King said what can I give
[1:07:08] [Music]
[1:07:09] you shees
[1:07:11] again went to the
[1:07:14] mother the King has said I have danced
[1:07:18] what should I give you says ask for the
[1:07:21] head of John the Baptist then she daned
[1:07:24] back the head of John the
[1:07:30] bapti powerful
[1:07:35] women and
[1:07:37] indeed her had nothing to
[1:07:40] do the power of the
[1:07:43] woman took the head of John the
[1:07:49] bapti so when God wanted to do something
[1:07:53] special
[1:07:55] with the men who were coming as Covenant
[1:07:59] men he
[1:08:01] chose to
[1:08:03] push the original
[1:08:07] influence through the
[1:08:12] mother they
[1:08:14] knew what God was going to do with their
[1:08:18] children even before the father's
[1:08:21] knew the power of a woman
[1:08:25] must be used
[1:08:27] POS and you men tap into that
[1:08:32] power plant seeds of
[1:08:34] character because the uses it
[1:08:38] negatively you will not like
[1:08:43] it
[1:08:46] Jacob is only the mother who
[1:08:49] knew God's plan for his
[1:08:52] life amen
[1:08:56] the angel spoke to manoah's
[1:09:00] wife manah the mother of
[1:09:04] Samson the father knew
[1:09:06] nothing when it came to Jesus the angel
[1:09:10] spoke to
[1:09:11] Mary Joseph knew
[1:09:14] nothing and when came to the prophet of
[1:09:17] this
[1:09:18] age he saw the mother who saw the pill
[1:09:22] of light at the birth of the son
[1:09:26] when it came to John
[1:09:28] Wesley is the mother who had the power
[1:09:31] of
[1:09:40] influence if you don't s good seeds in
[1:09:44] them you lose the
[1:09:50] children parents are you
[1:09:53] here how many
[1:09:56] fathers
[1:09:58] die
[1:10:00] lamenting when children have deserted
[1:10:05] them and they care for the
[1:10:09] mothers am I speaking some
[1:10:13] here the
[1:10:15] fathers failed to S the right seeds
[1:10:25] bus we are
[1:10:36] busy you know Franc she's working com
[1:10:44] back it becomes
[1:10:48] bad when you fail to get the Fifth
[1:10:51] Gospel
[1:10:56] jeel got into the
[1:10:58] house took over ahab's
[1:11:07] mind's before could take her
[1:11:11] mind and that was a
[1:11:16] disaster
[1:11:21] sisters don't you think
[1:11:25] you are
[1:11:27] okay because you
[1:11:29] control your
[1:11:34] husband you make it impossible for
[1:11:37] him to plant these
[1:11:40] seeds of the vision of his
[1:11:45] family but that
[1:11:48] part God didn't give it to
[1:11:51] you he gave it to the Man
[1:11:59] I
[1:12:00] normally don't do
[1:12:03] this
[1:12:05] marriage
[1:12:10] services but I'm so much of a believer
[1:12:14] in
[1:12:19] principles if the principles are
[1:12:22] wrong you can never get the result
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:31] right in the leadership
[1:12:34] message and I'll leave it there maybe
[1:12:38] when the Lord gives me another
[1:12:41] opportunity I'll come back again the
[1:12:44] prophet says the
[1:12:47] first this is in raising children
[1:12:50] now is the mother's kind
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:56] then the father's
[1:12:58] word after the mother gives you your
[1:13:02] first
[1:13:04] step then look to your
[1:13:07] daddy all of us for wisdom because he
[1:13:12] the head of the
[1:13:15] house so this is the principle of
[1:13:19] it the father S talks
[1:13:22] you and then you become a wife
[1:13:27] when you become a wife he PLS the mind
[1:13:30] of
[1:13:32] Christ that makes a
[1:13:34] mother and then God made a
[1:13:38] mother in such a way that a little
[1:13:42] child understands her better and then
[1:13:46] says okay raise up this
[1:13:48] child but if you retain this
[1:13:52] child and don't always subit her to the
[1:13:57] you will lose
[1:14:00] her but now after rising
[1:14:03] up you put to the hands of the
[1:14:06] father to plant continuing
[1:14:11] wisdom you will have
[1:14:14] children okay so when the children fall
[1:14:19] back into the hearts of the
[1:14:22] Father the father knows the next step
[1:14:26] he will influence
[1:14:28] them with the same
[1:14:30] seed that made the
[1:14:33] mother hallelujah hallelujah and finally
[1:14:36] they will be at the
[1:14:38] altar father we are giving our lives to
[1:14:42] you from that day we have a Christian
[1:14:47] Home amen so when the children fall
[1:14:51] back
[1:14:53] amen from the
[1:14:56] fall in the hands of the father from the
[1:14:59] hands of the
[1:15:01] father into the hands of the
[1:15:04] shepherd when he gets
[1:15:06] interested when the pastor gets
[1:15:10] interested with the lives of your
[1:15:13] children and you are a spiritual
[1:15:16] family don't
[1:15:21] interfere God bless you
[1:15:25] do
