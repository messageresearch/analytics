========================================

I wouldn't want a situation when the pastor changes Dimensions amen change his Dimensions amen Amina then the younger men that are presented as who is going to take over our sons foreign [Music] [Music] and then those tribes that were around the beginning [Music] all this kind of tries to come and torment them and then the Bible says then God would descend them and God was with that church [Music] we want a church where every family has got access to God are you together with it what is it they've got access to God so I feel good when I'm talking to families part of the church you are the ones that make the strong Foundation of a church but when the Book of Judges is starting the foundations that have been swept down almost whatever was right in their owners now it's come to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and the certain man of Bethel limited went to Saturn in the country [Music] and his true sons that was the moment of humility of humiliation that was the situation could not rise over um foreign [Music] [Music] no it's the situation better it cannot be handled moments of humility in our marriage and we're not even out escorted with the scriptures but the man has lost a job we need to put our hands together in the moments of security and entered the moments of Prayer if we know those as principles singer my name is the more we distance God from ourselves and we block our prayers but second Chronicles chapter 7 verse 13. if I shut up heaven foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] we keep God away from our families when we fight over situation which we have no control is calling us to humility that we may be able to pray together [Music] and went to Milwaukee amen America and the two of his sons [Music] died there situations like that I told him I told him but he had no man at the time and maybe the child he died that's an extreme case there's a situations that will just put us in moments of humidity rather than separate ourselves the two sons died incidentally was able to get truth so that she came back with Ruth a gentile um [Music] being grafted in the Hebrew Vines amen Amina it took life the two boys couldn't come back couldn't come back but at the end of the day all things work together amen was able to get rude and because of near me [Music] are you together foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] why does this happen right now why does this and you have no answer but we understand it better together [Music] you keep telling your husband will understand it better together keep that sweet spirit that God will come down the quicker in due time okay let me identify the title when God speaks to women amen so that you'll be able to understand First Corinthians chapter 11. we have always taught the man is the head of the family is by the way God established it first Corinthians but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is so the order is then God in Christ foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] got it so when this logos takes your body we see Jesus the Christ or Crystal amen Amina he is the headship of the Christian men yes by giving them a portion of his spirit that prayerful becomes the wisdom knowledge by which man becomes the head of the woman Hallelujah a man without Christ is not a man under the headship so it is then Christ takes the mind of the man and the man uses the mind of God [Music] to lead his wife [Music] so he certainly the Man in Christ that can have a stable Christian marriage because the one which takes Dominion Eternity for God it's not this man tell me I don't know but the Christ on the inside question who wants to marry must look for Christ I don't know your question in the mind not looking for an American height you lose the game somewhere now let's see we've got solutions to this problem I'm sure Martin didn't hear that you see but all unrestored men are outside [Music] by Menace gramatika because I told you what because there's no true story but the restaurant has the spirit of Christ I know my wife with the sweetness that it gives them [Music] are you together but men who have not been restored they've gone through by Menace the first in Genesis chapter 1 of course the spiritual man who was blessed through replenisha fill the Earth have dominion Buffalo but in the spiritual room so when your husband and wife you are together and you were born again marches were in this flesh but the Covenant of Genesis 1. puts that marriage together [Music] [Music] be fruitful [Music] [Music] shall be upon the Beast of the year they come true [Music] he uses this Roots his wife like a beast solo Fallen man that are not restored to the first Covenant will control by Menace by that form of teaching the woman will prone in fear hey in order to maintain her marriage and they'll teach them that the woman must maintain her existence in the man's home and she becomes a beggar for love many marriage was intended to be for the children of God build back the kingdom okay okay anybody who goes into it and is not a son of God does not have the blessings that goes with marriage in such marriages the men will find a problem listening to their wives I hope there are no men here that have a problem listening to their wives
