[1:26:45] opportunity that we have
[1:26:47] witnessed a teaching on the relationship
[1:26:51] of Christ and his church
[1:26:54] as we saw Peter and Juliet join in
[1:27:00] this I pray that you may bless this
[1:27:03] little
[1:27:05] sharing in Jesus name
[1:27:08] amen you may
[1:27:11] be so
[1:27:13] Adam came
[1:27:17] forth as both male and
[1:27:20] female sharing the same name
[1:27:24] sharing the same
[1:27:27] body and sharing the same
[1:27:31] spirit so God made
[1:27:34] sure that Adam remained that
[1:27:38] way until maturity was
[1:27:43] established so in Genesis 2 verse1
[1:27:48] 15 and the Lord God took the
[1:27:51] man and put him into the garden of
[1:27:55] to dress it and keep
[1:27:57] it so where was his
[1:28:00] wife his wife was still on the inside of
[1:28:04] it amen because in the beginning he was
[1:28:09] created in the image of
[1:28:11] God and the image of God is a
[1:28:15] spirit so Adam was a spirit
[1:28:19] being but he had his property on the
[1:28:22] inside of him
[1:28:25] and his property
[1:28:28] was it's the only wealth he
[1:28:32] had and now
[1:28:34] afterwards God
[1:28:36] saw that it was
[1:28:39] necessary to te the
[1:28:41] ground now he made
[1:28:43] Adam into the dust of the
[1:28:46] earth so he got the spirit and dressed
[1:28:50] it in a body but even as they came into
[1:28:53] the
[1:28:56] still he had his property on the side
[1:29:00] here amen God could not
[1:29:03] separate Adam and Eve until Adam had
[1:29:09] matured to the level where he could be
[1:29:11] able to hand a
[1:29:14] marriage are you together with me he
[1:29:17] couldn't let her
[1:29:19] go until Adam had grown to a level where
[1:29:23] he could
[1:29:24] marry a
[1:29:27] wife that's why I don't
[1:29:29] believe in Little Children going along
[1:29:33] around
[1:29:35] there somebody is about 17
[1:29:38] years and the girl is 15 years they are
[1:29:42] trying to make a
[1:29:43] marriage it's not scripture God did not
[1:29:47] allow
[1:29:48] that in the case of
[1:29:51] humanity because God allowed that with
[1:29:55] they don't care you know when he created
[1:29:58] them from day one they were a husband
[1:30:02] and
[1:30:03] wife but God did not do the same when it
[1:30:07] came to
[1:30:08] humanity so God needed man to mature
[1:30:12] first to develop a man but these days
[1:30:17] you find some people that have not
[1:30:21] matured they are men they've got painted
[1:30:26] faces and they want to come and take
[1:30:28] somebody's
[1:30:30] daughter they are coming to a house they
[1:30:33] want to get married they've got all kind
[1:30:36] of shag
[1:30:38] hair and is not grown at
[1:30:40] all he doesn't show the maturity that
[1:30:43] cares for a
[1:30:45] wife he has got a balance of a
[1:30:48] TR totally
[1:30:50] responsible but he still wants to marry
[1:30:53] somebody
[1:30:55] God did not allow that he had watch for
[1:31:01] maturity that Adam I know your wife is
[1:31:05] in your
[1:31:06] side but I'm not going to allow you to
[1:31:09] become a husband to
[1:31:11] her until you have
[1:31:15] matured okay so you see God had to put
[1:31:21] Adam in Hest at first
[1:31:25] amen so that Adam needed to be
[1:31:32] productive he was tendering his
[1:31:36] garden and God came in his
[1:31:40] farm amen so is that so that Adam was
[1:31:44] now mature
[1:31:46] enough he had to check on
[1:31:49] him how did he check on the maturity of
[1:31:54] he checked on the maturity
[1:31:56] of by causing
[1:31:58] Adam to stand right there and he said
[1:32:03] Adam I'm now going to bring both these
[1:32:06] animals and see what you going to call
[1:32:09] them when the animals came he began to
[1:32:12] name them he named them but let me say
[1:32:17] it's not Adam who named them but Adam
[1:32:21] entered into the mind of God and he knew
[1:32:24] what those
[1:32:25] animals and they called them by what God
[1:32:32] would so Adam was so
[1:32:35] mature that he
[1:32:38] worked and he also thought like a
[1:32:42] [Music]
[1:32:44] God and then he says how can I leave
[1:32:48] such a
[1:32:49] man without a help me
[1:32:56] are you together with me so
[1:32:59] God needed to see how
[1:33:02] Adam would
[1:33:04] mature now what is
[1:33:07] maturity maturity is when a
[1:33:11] man begins to think like a
[1:33:18] god when Adam thought like a
[1:33:21] God God said is mature
[1:33:24] [Music]
[1:33:26] he would see the mind of
[1:33:30] God that's
[1:33:33] matur you know God has a
[1:33:37] wife and his wife is called the
[1:33:42] church and God the same way he handles
[1:33:48] the
[1:33:50] church is the same way he will desire
[1:33:54] us to handle a
[1:33:58] wife so when God wanted to
[1:34:02] teach his
[1:34:04] relationship between him and the
[1:34:07] church he chose to bring the
[1:34:12] institution of marriage so that by
[1:34:16] marriage a man would be
[1:34:20] showing what the Mind God has towards
[1:34:24] his
[1:34:27] church so that's why it is necessary
[1:34:31] that when a man is thinking of
[1:34:34] marriage to come and be part of a
[1:34:38] church be told the mind of
[1:34:41] God to think like a god to choose like a
[1:34:46] god you see the difference between man
[1:34:50] now and man then
[1:34:55] Adam he did not have a
[1:34:58] choice but you you have the choice why
[1:35:02] do you have a choice because God gives
[1:35:05] you his
[1:35:07] mind you begin to think like him you've
[1:35:10] been in a church you've been taught and
[1:35:14] then you look among the
[1:35:17] ladies I'll have
[1:35:20] mercy on whom I'll have mercy
[1:35:24] so Peter
[1:35:28] looked and had mer upon
[1:35:33] Juliet that's how God chooses us to
[1:35:38] Salvation to
[1:35:40] Salvation he says I love I
[1:35:43] love if a husband is the image of
[1:35:46] Christ he
[1:35:48] looks with the intent I have mer on whom
[1:35:51] I love
[1:35:54] and then Juliet you are privileged
[1:35:58] somebody has had mer on
[1:36:02] you 44 years
[1:36:05] ago I had M on
[1:36:09] somebody come I had Mery upon somebody
[1:36:21] [Applause]
[1:36:24] you see she has that
[1:36:27] confidence she know somebody had Mery
[1:36:30] upon
[1:36:31] her 44 years
[1:36:35] ago
[1:36:44] yes so God bless you she has cooked my
[1:36:49] food for 44 years
[1:36:53] that's why we don't get
[1:36:57] old you can go back so
[1:37:00] Peter listen you are not going in a
[1:37:05] trial there's a song which used to to
[1:37:19] say like that go back J J
[1:37:25] this is
[1:37:27] not and when you
[1:37:30] know that you are now
[1:37:34] bound you must be bound to the love of
[1:37:38] that
[1:37:46] [Music]
[1:37:48] manes every
[1:37:51] morning you put in the
[1:37:56] I know
[1:38:00] [Music]
[1:38:07] what I tell you when he gets annoyed he
[1:38:11] looks very bad so you maintain that
[1:38:15] smile so this is what God
[1:38:19] did he allowed Peter I mean
[1:38:24] Adam and he says such a man cannot stay
[1:38:29] alone I'll give him a
[1:38:34] help made for
[1:38:38] him since now women have the right to
[1:38:44] choose we choose what is meat for
[1:38:51] us show me your level maturity
[1:38:55] and I will also give
[1:38:57] you the kind of wife you
[1:39:01] deserve that was the contract between
[1:39:04] Adam and
[1:39:06] God and when Adam displayed the
[1:39:10] maturity and maturity is having the mind
[1:39:14] of
[1:39:15] God you forgive like God and when God
[1:39:19] forgives he doesn't remember our sin
[1:39:23] sometimes we look at one another like a
[1:39:27] men of
[1:39:32] Flesh and when he repented God not
[1:39:35] forgive God is not like that he forgives
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:41] you that's what I want in your
[1:39:43] house just because you have the mind of
[1:39:47] God you know now this one here is the
[1:39:50] image of the
[1:39:52] church the church will always make
[1:39:55] mistakes will always fail but when the
[1:39:58] church fails there's the blood of Jes
[1:40:02] where she can go and watch she can be
[1:40:06] forgiven I don't know why people
[1:40:09] divorce because the Church of Christ
[1:40:12] once it commits a sin it is not
[1:40:18] divorced you know when she takes
[1:40:22] the the Lord Jesus and said father I
[1:40:26] pray you might have Grace upon
[1:40:29] me God says forgiven 70 * S A
[1:40:37] Day learn to
[1:40:40] forgive and
[1:40:46] jul hold that man is forgive me my my my
[1:40:50] my honey
[1:40:53] forgive me my
[1:40:56] Lord that's enough Peter you don't go
[1:41:00] into
[1:41:04] why like a
[1:41:08] god just
[1:41:10] forgive and you just
[1:41:18] repent you see when Adam married
[1:41:24] what he
[1:41:25] married was a byproduct from
[1:41:31] him and he recognized
[1:41:34] her and he said this is born of my
[1:41:38] B Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called
[1:41:41] a woman because she was taken
[1:41:46] out so what you
[1:41:49] marry will always be a reflection of
[1:41:52] your inner
[1:41:55] strength all your inner
[1:42:00] weakness what you marry is a reflection
[1:42:04] of what you are on the
[1:42:09] inside if you married a
[1:42:15] figure you should not buy enough food in
[1:42:17] the house
[1:42:23] because she must
[1:42:26] St in order to M the
[1:42:32] figure because you married a
[1:42:36] figure when you buy the
[1:42:39] food she start
[1:42:46] going not the
[1:42:48] wife you see how she looks
[1:42:53] if you married a smart lady with nice
[1:42:59] clothes you made a
[1:43:02] mistake because shops I mean clothes
[1:43:06] they just buy from the
[1:43:09] shop you can get a Shabby
[1:43:13] one and you dress her to that
[1:43:16] level So Adam when he looked at
[1:43:21] Eve he says hey
[1:43:24] this is exactly me in a duplicate
[1:43:30] form she's born of my B she's Flesh of
[1:43:33] My Flesh she's Spirit of my spirit she
[1:43:37] will be called woman because she was
[1:43:39] come out
[1:43:40] of so this is why the secret of who the
[1:43:45] woman
[1:43:45] [Music]
[1:43:46] is remains
[1:43:49] silent amen but when she gets married
[1:43:54] and now you know Peter begins to love
[1:43:57] her all the other ingredients begin to
[1:44:01] come
[1:44:03] out you just love her you loved her and
[1:44:08] she says I'll marry
[1:44:11] you continue to love her she will give
[1:44:15] you
[1:44:15] children you continue to love her she'll
[1:44:19] give you good food you continue loving
[1:44:21] her
[1:44:23] she'll wash your clothes She'll always
[1:44:26] call you
[1:44:28] daring one she'll call you all
[1:44:31] kind because the
[1:44:33] switch is
[1:44:37] love when the switch
[1:44:40] changes things
[1:44:42] change maintain the love
[1:44:46] switch Peter are you listening
[1:44:50] to maintain the love s
[1:44:55] now we just talk
[1:44:59] about so now you have the
[1:45:04] trick you know she's
[1:45:08] me she's
[1:45:11] me that's why you cannot hurt your own
[1:45:16] body he that ha his wife ha his own body
[1:45:23] the
[1:45:23] Revelation she's born of my
[1:45:26] B she shall be called a woman woman
[1:45:29] meaning that which came out of
[1:45:32] the and it was so much part of
[1:45:35] him she would he would even
[1:45:39] die to protect her because it's
[1:45:44] her when anything is done to your
[1:45:48] wife is being done on you you don't like
[1:45:51] it
[1:45:53] you should be that
[1:45:56] one as Christ and the church is one
[1:46:01] Christ died to protect his
[1:46:07] church you should to protect that
[1:46:10] lady you should teach
[1:46:13] her the word of God daily because that
[1:46:17] was your
[1:46:18] maturity your maturity which took you
[1:46:20] into marriage
[1:46:23] is not because you didn't have a
[1:46:26] cook you don't marry
[1:46:29] cook you marry wife you don't marry a
[1:46:33] laundry
[1:46:35] person
[1:46:37] amen you married the
[1:46:40] wife and because she's a wife she'll
[1:46:43] give you food because she's a wife she
[1:46:46] will give you you know do your
[1:46:50] clothes so you did not marry child
[1:46:56] Factory so before anything
[1:46:59] else Juliet is your
[1:47:02] wife value her as a part of your
[1:47:07] body and God knew where to get her
[1:47:11] from if he got her from the foot he
[1:47:15] would walk over
[1:47:17] her but he brought her out of your
[1:47:21] re from the side of your
[1:47:24] heart so that your heart can love her
[1:47:29] and
[1:47:34] she I want to remind you one thing you
[1:47:38] see I'm just realizing that we came
[1:47:42] late so I should be stopping here but I
[1:47:46] want to tell you that after the
[1:47:49] fall did you hear me
[1:47:53] there's something that was dropped on
[1:47:59] Eve that
[1:48:01] heart will be after her
[1:48:08] husband that's the
[1:48:11] problem I mean Eve walked
[1:48:17] alone and
[1:48:20] met sweet talked
[1:48:24] and ate the fruit and the Earth came
[1:48:28] into this
[1:48:29] cast so after the
[1:48:32] fall God said your
[1:48:35] wife you you the lady your heart will
[1:48:40] always be after your
[1:48:44] hus because she made a
[1:48:47] mistake she could almost live without
[1:48:51] him now God says you should
[1:48:56] stop living
[1:48:59] without you feeling for your husband all
[1:49:03] the
[1:49:07] time if you are from the same
[1:49:12] body Sister Sister you'll always
[1:49:16] say
[1:49:18] Peter Peter how are you
[1:49:24] have you reach at work
[1:49:26] Peter that was a problem God dropped
[1:49:29] upon
[1:49:32] them don't start
[1:49:37] say don't you give me peace
[1:49:42] uhh that problem God dropped it to them
[1:49:45] they cannot live without
[1:49:50] you you know that even at midnight
[1:49:54] she has been calling
[1:49:57] you isn't that
[1:50:02] true and then you start saying Hey Now
[1:50:06] Juliet what does she
[1:50:07] think calling me at midnight like this
[1:50:11] that's the problem God
[1:50:13] gave a woman who is not
[1:50:17] jealous has a problem
[1:50:25] it them even
[1:50:28] he
[1:50:31] minutes are you are you
[1:50:34] near is already evening is on the
[1:50:38] table don't question why that's a
[1:50:42] problem God left
[1:50:48] for if she calls you 10 times a day
[1:50:53] be just
[1:50:55] grateful that you remained in her
[1:50:58] mind as she was leaving
[1:51:02] for Peter have you
[1:51:06] had just love
[1:51:13] her I wish we had time to talk about
[1:51:21] things this
[1:51:23] here is your greatest
[1:51:27] asset in the future of your
[1:51:35] family and you should let
[1:51:38] her to have a very good
[1:51:43] influence in your
[1:51:45] life if you let somebody
[1:51:48] else have more influence in your life
[1:51:54] then your wife you'll be in
[1:51:59] trouble allow
[1:52:01] her to own
[1:52:06] you allow her to hold that
[1:52:10] house you see these houses here we build
[1:52:14] very nice
[1:52:15] houses but these houses are for
[1:52:20] women a man can stay there maybe 3 hours
[1:52:24] a
[1:52:27] day and then goes to bed but this one
[1:52:31] here lives there all the
[1:52:33] time let her make the
[1:52:36] decision here I want this
[1:52:39] color because she's the one going to
[1:52:41] watch
[1:52:46] that and the house you are building you
[1:52:50] are building for your wife
[1:52:54] when Jesus went he said to his wife I'm
[1:52:58] going to prepare you
[1:53:00] place it is for us it's not for him so
[1:53:05] Peter when you build that
[1:53:07] house it is her
[1:53:10] house you know let her say this is where
[1:53:14] I want the pant to be this is where I
[1:53:17] want the C to be I want you to build a
[1:53:21] house
[1:53:22] and let her
[1:53:24] participate let her have an
[1:53:27] influence over your life you will have
[1:53:31] an everlasting
[1:53:33] family now we've got a man called
[1:53:37] zakas she had a wife called
[1:53:40] Rebecca but she had a very strong
[1:53:42] influence over
[1:53:44] him and she compelled
[1:53:48] Zak to go and see Jesus
[1:53:53] zakas was a very rich
[1:53:56] man he was working in the
[1:53:59] UR and he was very
[1:54:02] wealthy but she he had a wife at home he
[1:54:07] could go and SE people's
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:13] businesses he could look like a very
[1:54:17] man but at home the wife had an
[1:54:20] influence
[1:54:23] you m
[1:54:25] here very
[1:54:27] tough but every time he talks about his
[1:54:31] wife even mama
[1:54:36] here you let your wife have an
[1:54:40] influence you are the only
[1:54:43] [Music]
[1:54:46] two who own your
[1:54:49] world if you allow another person
[1:54:53] to stand between you and your
[1:54:56] wife is you who suffers the
[1:55:00] div and your children
[1:55:03] suffer allow your wife to have an
[1:55:06] influence over
[1:55:09] you in the Bible we've got a very
[1:55:12] powerful
[1:55:14] judge his name was called
[1:55:17] pilot he had the power to kill Christ
[1:55:22] save him but the Bible tells his wife
[1:55:27] had an influence over
[1:55:29] him and then she
[1:55:32] sent and told pilate don't have anything
[1:55:36] to do with
[1:55:38] this I suffered a dream because
[1:55:43] of and the Pate called for water
[1:55:52] was with this
[1:55:54] case there must be a
[1:55:57] power of a woman in your wife your life
[1:56:01] and that woman must be your
[1:56:07] wife when God wants to talk to your
[1:56:12] family about your
[1:56:15] children he talks to
[1:56:18] her that's the principle of the Bible
[1:56:22] Jacob had
[1:56:25] twins he had Jacob I mean Isaac had
[1:56:31] twins and then it had Jacob and Es and
[1:56:36] these children
[1:56:37] grew and one of them was a child of

[1:57:00] God in First Peter chapter
[1:57:03] 3 he tells the men dwell with them with
[1:57:09] understanding God made them when they
[1:57:13] are very
[1:57:14] timid sometimes they are not able to
[1:57:17] explain
[1:57:18] things they cry about things
[1:57:23] don't stop
[1:57:29] saying he says dwell with them with
[1:57:33] understanding you are not dwelling with
[1:57:35] a fellow man in the
[1:57:38] house you are having a wife who has a
[1:57:41] tender
[1:57:42] heart and then the Bible says that if
