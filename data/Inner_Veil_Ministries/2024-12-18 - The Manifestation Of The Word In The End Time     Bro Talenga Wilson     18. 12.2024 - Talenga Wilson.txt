speak to you tonight amen take such Grace amen for us to always stand before you that's why you always say keep us in prayer that we are able to speak the mind of God Amen for the Bible says Heaven and Earth will pass away but only the word of God so we strive to always speak the word of God I want to appreciate the presence of our pastor and we appreciate God and we appreciate God who moved him out for the missions and he's back with us amen and pastor Pastor James is not with us he's still on Mission we keep him in prayer amen so I want to welcome you to the service tonight and I want us to turn to the Book of Genesis chapter 1 verse one amen for a title this evening it's the manifestation of the word in the end times amen amen so let's pick it from The Book of Genesis in the beginning God created the Heaven and and Earth was with without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the and God said there be there us Precious Jesus ice haveed and that I come and speak as a I Lord but I pray father that the gra that has me to speak tonight the usare us as we sail on this journey waiting for your coming I have your word know give it life I pray father that you may give life to the word which we have read that may bless each one of us and bless all the hearers those that are online and those that are present and we also pray for those that are coming to join us you may enable them toen up their feet so they can come and be part of the service we bless your holy name in the most precious name CHR amen we get seated amen so now in the beginning the Bible says God created the Heaven and Earth and in verse God said let there be praise the Lord so God made a statement God spoke let there be light praise the Lord and like we saw last Wednesday that when God spoke whatever he spoke had to be in expression it had to come into manifestation so whatever was manifested was the expression of the mind of God praise God so when God said let there be lights and the Bible says and there was light so in the mind of God thought of light and he saw the light so he spoke the words and light came forth an expression of what was the mind of God praise the Lord so now we see that everything that was created was created by the spoken word praise the Lord so at the beginning God heard the word then he began to s the word into the world and he said let there be the earth and the heaven praise the Lord let there be light praise the Lord And now when we turn to the Book of Genesis ver 26 praise the Lord now here when God was creating man he still spoke the word praise the Lord he said let us create man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the F of the air and over the CLE and over all the Earth every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him so we still see that verse 26 the first part when God was done creating the Heaven and the Earth and all the things that are in he said let us create man that was a statement he spoke the word he sold a seed praise the Lord so God sold a seed in the beginning which was the word praise the Lord so everything that was created which was created by the spoken word it was a seed that God planted and everything that he planted he expected a manifestation of the seity that's why when he said let there be light praise the Lord he planted the seed of the spoken word and then light came for a manifestation praise the lord of the seed that God had planted praise the of living God and now when he comes to man he still has man in his thoughts then he speaks the word he plants the seed and then he expects to see a manifestation of the seed that he had planted and when he said let us create man and verse 27 says so God created man in his own image praise the Lord so it first it was the spoken word then we see a manifestation of the spoken words when man is created praise the Lord so now we notice that everything that God spoke everything that God created he created everything specific when he said let there be light the Bible does not say and there was water praise the Lord so every word that went forth out of his mouth it brought forth its kindness prise if it was light it had to be light manifested if it was man it had to be man manifested so we see that whatever he planted in the beginning God expects to see the fruits to see the seeds that bear the same nature what was spoken in the beginning praise the Lord and just like we said said last Wednesday that we were in the mind of God praise the Lord and God wanted us to be manifest so he spoke the word and when he spoke the word came into existence a manifestation an expression of the thought that was in the mind of God so whatever was created it is the expression of the mind of God the Lord whatever we see praise the Lord the animals the vegetations the entire nature it is all an expression of what was in the mind of God before he began to say Let There be this praise the Lord because the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth but you see how take us back the artist praise the Lord any artist when they want to do something they first of all have the imagination in their mind praise the Lord and then they begin to ponder about it and then the picture begins to grow and when he feels the picture is ready of what he wanted to be then he gets a pen he gets a boat and he begins to draw whatever he's putting on the board is the expression of the mind that he had before he got a to draw it so whatever we see on Earth you and I and all nature were in the mind of God as a before he began creation so now he comes and says let there be and it was praise the Lord when he says Let There be this bir it had to be that b because it is what was in the mind of God before he spoke it so when I say that we are the expression of the mind of God before the foundation of the world then I am right and now I want us to drive to something the estation of the word which God s in the beginning the manifestation the expression of the word which God planted as a seed in Genesis praise the Lord because when a farmer goes out to plant he picks a seat and he throws it to the ground and he does not throw into the ground to leave it there prise Lord he gives it time but the purpose of throwing this seed to the ground to get back the seed of the same kind praise the Lord so if farmer does not get a bean seed puts it to the ground and he expects to get jack fruit praise the Lord if he wants ja fuit he will get those fruits and then he burries them to the ground and he will be expecting Jack the same way God did in the beginning praise the Lord so now when he began to create praise the Lord he also created man and now when he created man he created him by the word and so he kept man in the garden by the word praise the Lord that's why where he created Adam and he told them you can eat of any fruit of the garden this touch not it was by the word praise the Lord so he expected man to express obedience to the word why because he created him by the word and the intention of God the mind of God was to lead man by the same word which was created why because man must bring forth praise the Lord FRS must bring forths that are like what created him so if you are created by the word so we we are expected to bring forth fruits that are worthy of the words in other words we are expected to express to manest that word by which we were created praise the Lord and so now God put them in the garden and said be there enjoy everything have dominion praise the Lord and so he kept them there by the words but now along the way we know Satan comes and when he comes he also came by the word and the Bible does not say that Satan disputed disputed the word which God had given to Adam and Eve no he never said that but what Satan did he twisted a little bit of the words he said it's true he said do not eat this but this is what he meant so now Satan change the interpretation of the word which led to the fall of Man but what was the intention of Satan he also wanted to SW his seed praise the Lord and remember the parable when God spoke about a farmer when Jesus spoke about par went out to s that when he went to S he saw the seeds then he went to sleep then the Neighbors in the night they came and brought wild seeds when the servants went in the morning after the C had started gerting they saw that there were some seties that we coming up that we different what their Master had saw so now they came and they told him Master we have seen some seats that are different from what we planted and they said let us go and have fruit and what did what did Jesus say he said leave them to grow together at the time of harvest it shall be a time of Separation praise the Lord so now when Satan came into the garden he also wanted to bring a seed and pl it into the garden praise the Lord so now God could not destroy it all he allowed them to grow and at Harvest Time that's when the wheat shall be gathered together then the tears shall be buled for burning let them grow together why because God has confidence in the seed that he has planted praise the Lord he's aware that whatever he has planted it must bring forth for youth of its kind so regardless of the kind of seats regardless of the Ws that the devil has planted at the end of the day the seeds that are being planted must bring forth their kind praise the Lord and now we are created in the image of God we are created by the spoken words and now God is confident that regardless of how the devil has fought from the beginning to change the course of the words he knows that he planted the the words he created us by the words he knows that in the evening time at Harvest Time the true bride the true seed of God must bring forth the word he must bear fruits of the word praise the Lord and that's what the prophet says in the message the spoken word he says praise the Lord he says that the true bright the true seed that was planted in the Garden of Eden we shall know them by the word you test them by the word you tell them the word and see if they shall believe it praise the Lord they may all profess to be Christians praise the Lord but at the time of harvest give them the word the word shall do a separation the true seed of God the Bible says my sheep know my voice so when you speak the word he shall hear the word he shall obey the word he shall follow the word praise the lord and there is nothing that can come between that True Believer and the words why because in the beginning he was made by the word praise the Lord and now even if the devil came along the way and brought a separation because the seed is in there the seed has to grow and the seed is growing and the Bible tells us that the master the master shall come in the time of harest to harvest back whatever he put in the ground and we are confident that in the end of times God shall come down to harvest whatever he planted in the beginning praise the Lord and so what does that lead us to it means that in the end times there shall be a people that shall manifest the seed that was planted in the Garden of Eden that Living God and now goded his course to lead his people by the word he never changes it he led them by the word praise the Lord and now he's to judge the people by the word praise the Lord because it is the word that he planted when he comes to judge he simply coming to look for his SE praise the Lord and so now when he comes he has to be identified and he has to identify himself by the word praise the Lord it has to be the same spoken word he sold in the beginning praise the Lord that's why he has always led the People by the word remember Israel his people his first bride he L them by the word praise the Lord he often sent a prophet to lead the People by the word until the people came to a point why because there was a [Music] tear that had been planted in the Garden of Eden praise the Lord and it has been growing All Through the Ages and now it came to a time during the times of Samuel when Samuel had grown old that the ERS of the church they looked at him and they looked at his children so they connived they said let us go and meet Sam let's go and speak to him that now we need a king of our own to lead us praise the Lord God had been Leading the People by his words he often sent the prophets to lead the People by his word he often sent out the word time Israel was going he sent the word to bring them back on track praise the Lord each time there was something wrong God sent the word to put the people back to the life the Lord but because there was a seat there was a tear and God allowed it there for a purpose he say allow them to grow together there shall be an identification at the time of harvest why because when I come I shall be looking for the seed which I planted and anything that is of a different nature shall be boundled together shall be burned praise the Lord and now they came and said 1 Samuel 8 ver4 chapter 8 verse4 then all the Elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel and to Rama and said unto him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us they wanted to be like other nations praise the Lord yet they were as special people it was a special seed but God when he created man he gave him a fre moral agent praise the Lord he created him by the word and he gave him the word to lead him but now God has given you the the opportunity either believe him or not that's why now the people they said we want to be like other nations give us a king judge us the way other nations are so now this was a turning point it was a crossroad that now Israel was turning away from the word and they wanted to be like others praise the Lord this is the same message the serpent brought Eve praise the Lord you can do this and be like others but now we are not created to be like others but we are created be like God why because we come from God and we must go back to God praise the Lord so there is nothing of us to desire anything from the world we are not of the world praise the Lord so our desires must be guided by the word of God our SS must be guided by the word of God we should not have the desire to be like others make us a king so we can be like others free moral agent you can believe God creates you his own image by his own word then he says go and have the reion all the things in the Earth are yours go rule over them and have dominion but here is my word here is my compass shall always guide you then he gives you the word but man the nature of man because of the free moral ages he makes decisions whether to believe or not to believe praise the Lord but like I said before the master said let them grow together praise the Lord let them grow together why because in his mind he knows that those that are his can never get lost that's why Jesus says praise the Lord we read that scripture last time Jesus said all them that the father has given me I shall lose none praise the Lord oh that the father has given to me I shall lose none I shall keep them until the last day praise the Lord so regardless of the doctrines that come because Jesus warned us in the Book of Matthew I think it's in chapter 24 he said yeah I'll put you to the world I have given you my words praise the Lord I have Tau you the words but now there shall come weird doctrines there shall come false prophets and those false prophets shall bring different doctrines and he said be careful because he shall be so close to the truth that if it were possible they would receive even the very elect praise the Lord so now Satan put on his skin praise the Lord and then he came and presented the word to Eve and says it is true it is what he said but this is what he made he made a Twist you have the the moral agents to believe praise the Lord but we have an assurance that we were in the mind of God praise the Lord that God created us in his own mind he created us by his own word and so we are the word of God and if we are the word of God Heaven and Earth shall pass away anything else shall fail but the word of God shall never fail so if you are created the image of God by the spoken words and if the Bible says that heaven and Earth shall pass away but the word shall never pass away that means to you and the word one so you are Eternal and you can never fa praise the Lord so now if you have the word a mirror praise the Lord you read the word and you are able to see yourself and see your name in the words praise the Lord and the Bible says in Romans chapter 8 I think around verse 35 because we know who we are there is nothing that shall ever separate us from the love of God there is nothing that can ever separate us from the word of Praise the Lord why we are planted by the word in the words and we shall we must bring forth the manifestation of the word of God in our lives praise the Lord why because that's what God is coming coming to harvest his word and is his word right praise the Lord because Jesus said if you believe me and you keep my words and keep my judgments I will not be under I am going to come and I'm going to be in you that you and I are one praise the Lord so now if Jesus dwells in us if the word of God because the Bible tells us that Jesus is the word of God praise the Lord and everything was created by Him and for him praise the Lord so you are created by Him by his spoken word and you are created for him so you came out of the mouth of God by the spoken words and you go back to God as the spoken what so now when he's coming he's coming to harvest that se which he planted in the Book of Genesis let us create man in our own image and he created man praise the Lord and that seat which went to the ground in the Book of Genesis that seed must be harvested when the time for Harvest is praise the Lord I'll take you to the to the message here what the prophet says in the message condemnation by representation he makes a statement in paragraph 29 and he says we know that we can't take an orange tree and grow citus fruits of different kind s or8 we can put lemons on it it will grow right in because it's a citrus fruit it will grow grape fruit and many other antangin and many other citus fruits but if that tree brings forth its own Branch again it will be an orange praise the Lord take that picture friends the prophet says you can have your or and you know what science has done today they do grafting praise the Lord so now they shall get this orange tree and then they cut it and he says the life in the tree is the orange it is the life that was put here and now it has been cut up and it branches have been taken off and says even if they bring other branches from other trees and then they come and graft it together yes if they bring a mangle tree it shall it shall bear the mang fruits but as long as the life inside here still there it gets a chance to bring forth its branches rather it shall still bring an orange why because the life on the inside here the orange and God says let us create man and in chapter two the Bible says after he had created man he got a hold of him and then he got a hold of him and he gave him his life praise the Lord God gave man his life how he gave him breath he breathed man and Man became a living soul that living soul is is the seed of God it Bears the life of God and as long as that seed is still there bearing the life of God regardless of how far the devil takes as long as the life is still there when the time comes when the right time has come that life shall come out praise the Lord and when the word is spoken when the spoken word go it shall recognize the voice praise the Lord when the word of God is preached shall recognize that voice why because it Bears the life of God praise the Lord the life of God is in there can never die praise the Lord and he says and we believe that there is to be a church in the last days that will receive both former and latter Reigns it will be scattered throughout the world in this laition age will be a church that that's called back to the original faith in God it will be a church that will have Jesus Christ walking in it manifesting himself the shout of the king will be in it in thisan church that says I am rich and I need nothing I am increased with Goods praise the Lord that has rejected the word the prophet says there is going to be a church that is coming out of this laition age why because in this age is a bright in this age is a person is a people that have the life of God which theyed before the beginning says they shall come to manifestation and they shall manifest Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ will manifest himself within them and he shall be king to them there shall be a people in the end times praise the Lord that shall identify themselves with the word not because they choose to but because their nature in the first place the nature of the words and it must identify itself with the words why it is Harvest Time the te must gather together the denominations must come together and the Bri the word of God the seed that is to manifest in the end times shall also get identified with Christ and Christ will manifest himself in them praise them living and how it shall be by the spoken words praise the Lord just the same way it was in the Old Testament when God LED Israel by the spoken word through the prophets and even when Jesus was coming praise the Lord he still sent a prophet who was rejected and he found his abort in the wilderness why because the rest of the denominations rejected him they couldn't contain him his life was different praise the Lord and now he kept himself there in the wilderness until the time appointed was come and when the time appointed was come the voice came out of the Wilderness and it went out the world to proclaim the first coming of Jesus it was a word that he spoke praise the Lord and now God promised us the same thing at the second coming of Jesus Christ he says there shall be a spoken word a word shall go forth do nothing but locate praise the Lord every SE wherever they are in the world and when this spoken word came for it began loc it was spoken it began loc it found you I don't know where found me found the other one found each one of us praise the Lord it was the spoken word and you were able to to listen and hear it and believe it because in you is the seed of the spoken words let us man it was the spoken word and he created man in the image of God created he them so we come into the world with that life praise the Lord so when the message of the evening Time Goes Forth brother he shall awaken that life it shall awaken that life in the seat that each one of us is bearing praise the Lord and nothing shall come in between praise the Lord and now I will take you to another I Willen you again to the prophet Joshua praise the Lord now Joshua was a type of Christ Joshua is a very good type praise the Lord remember he was always with Moses and the rest of the people when they were crossing over to can praise the Lord and so many people when they reached there there those that doubted but Joshua kept his fa Joshua kept the word why because Joshua he was a prophet and we believe that he was and God spoke to Joshua he often came and spoke to him and he gave him his word he say stand up I will go and I will fight for you and I will give you this land until you for an inheritance Joshua got that promise josua heard the word and he believed that word praise the Lord so when they reached over the people doubted but Joshua kept the word and he knew that at the right time God would give them the land praise the Lord he believed it and he had with him they believed and surely God gave them the praise the Living God let's get the M identification of Christ in all ages the prophet makes another statement and says God with his thoughts becoming material and then that brings us with eternal life and eternal life there is only one form of it that is God and then it is God expressed in his church like God expressed in his son it's the same God in all the time God above us God With Us God in us bringing the whole thing right back because he Eternal and whatever comes out of him is eternal so when the spoken word came out of him that spoken word was eternal praise the Lord that's why can never die and if we had the spoken word that came out of him the prophet says God is still bringing it right back the same spoken word which is spoke in Genesis is still bringing it right back into place as the bride praise the Lord so the Bride of Jesus Christ is the manifestation of the word of God in the end times praise the Lord and again he says in the same message remember in the beginning the only fortifi that God gave Adam and Eve was to stay behind his word that's all that's all he gave them to stay behind the word and that's the only thing that God has given to the church that God has given to the bride is the spoken word to stay behind the spoken word to be led by the spoken words praise the Living God because the spoken word is the shepherd himself spoken Jesus himself so we are to stay be to stand behind him and allow him to lead us and he says God will judge the world not by any certain group he will judge the World by Jesus Christ and Christ is the word he is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so he is the expressed word of God in every age he makes seem the same yesterday today and forever it was Jesus in Genesis when Jesus created the Heaven and Earth it was Jesus in Genesis when God created Us Praise the Lord he's the same spoken words that's what the Bible says everything was created by Him and for him by him in the beginning and for him because whatever was created by Him it shall have to go back to him praise the Living God and in some place he said if you love his what which we certainly do we love his word what proves that we love his word because we are part of him we are part of his word praise the Lord we are part of the word and so we love his word because the word is in US you can't separate yourself from the word because that's who you are that's who we are we were created by the word and if we are created by the word so that makes us the word praise the Lord so we can't separate ourselves from the word so now the devil shall try to separate bring all sorts of Doctrine but as long as the life of the word is in there the Lord when we hear the voice of the master we shall say Here I Am shall be identified by the word so now if God is to judge the World by his word which is Christ praise the Lord and Christ the word of God dwells in us which makes us the word that means that God will judge the World by you and me praise the Lord God will judge the World by Us Praise the Lord because we stayed in the world as the manifestation of the word of God we say in the world as the reflection of the word of God praise the Lord and we bear the fruits of the world and if God is to judge my neighbor he shall not judge my neighbor by Angels you shall judge your neighbor shall judge your neighbor by we ourselves because we lived amongest them and we expressed the words we expressed obedience to the world praise the Lord and why is God going to judge the world how did he judge the world in the times of Noah he judged the world praise the Lord when he brought the flood because of unbelief they never believed they spoken what that God sent through his Prophet God sent Noah to go and preach and the word which he spoke would be the one that was going to judge the rest of them why because those that believed pass over judgment but those that never believe were destroyed it was judgment and God is going to judge the World by his spoken word Jud the World by his word those that believe have passed over judgment but those that don't believe are condemned praise the Living God let's stand here to the message all the days of our life 1959 so you see we are just getting nearer home now the Messiah is being made known brighter brighter every day like Shadow coming it gets more and more and more until it becomes completely positive th when Christ and his bride un together then we will be one in him in the evening time this word must put on flesh in the evening time this spoken word must put on flesh to manifest the nature the image and likeness of God praise the Lord it must put on flesh once again such that the image which God s the image which was in the beginning in the mind of God and the words must unite to be one and when the word unit with that image then we become the manifestation of God the word put on flesh praise the Lord so we and Christ become one praise the Lord and that's what he says praise the Lord let's stand another quote here in that message the spoken word is the original he says now he's likening this to the tears and with the evening time remember that Parable it is speaks about the Harvest Time which Harvest time we are living because we are the bright of Jesus Christ in thean church age which is the last age of the Gentiles praise the Lord so now we are in the evening of the times we at that time of harvest we are at that time when God must come down take back whatever he planted and says El's Behavior Moses's Behavior John's Behavior leaving their field of [Music] service many of the people didn't understand them it was because they was rejected their message the seed had been sown praise the Lord Elijah sold the seed Moses sold the seat John sold the seat and the seed was planted praise the Lord it had been swn and once the seed is swn what do you wait for you wait for Harvest praise the Lord and now God sold the seed what is he waiting for he's waiting for Harvest praise the Lord and what next judgment praise the Lord and say and was a sign to the people God that judgment was at hand planting was over I believe someday the real bride of Christ will be for to stop preaching the word of God the of it that's in reev denominations will force it to stop take its Mark you know when the Bible talks about the mark of the beast praise the Lord it's in the evening time that now denominations will force their rule over the church the Bri praise the Lord you either stop reaching or you have their Mark and then continue preaching praise the Lord but the true bright the true seed of God believes that there is only one God and there is nothing else other than that one God praise the Lord and regardless of the forces that denominations shall impose that will not change the faith and mind of the believer there is one God praise God and that's what shall identify Us in the last days in the evening of time praise the lord well the rest of the world Shall Gather together they shall be brought together by that doctrine of the three by that Doctrine praise the Lord of believing in Trinity and each of them shall receive the mark of the beast the Bride of Jesus Christ because she is a SE she's the wit praise the Lord she was planted by the master she cannot be adulterated her mind cannot be changed she was Tau right there is only one God and she cannot change that praise the Lord she has no control over it it's what she was told what was planted and it is what must come to manifestation there is one God the entire world gang up against her she will stand right with the words praise the Lord and we shall stand and judge the world praise the Lord because the rest of them Shall Believe The Trinity and they shall receive the mark of the be but we shall believe only one God because the Bible says there is but one God and you must love your God with all your heart he never said love your Gods love your Gods with all your heart with all your mind your soul and says I believe someday you will be forced and says then when the lamb will take his bright and judge the for this and judge the praise the Lord nothing separating the bright of Jesus from the word of God because the seed was planted it shall have to grow until it comes to maturity praise the Lord and when it reaches maturity it shall manifest the real true nature of the originator praise the Lord and says they can take away everything but man and the woman that has received the word and come into that personal relationship with it if you have believed this word and you have found a personal relationship with spoken there is nothing that can take this word out why it has found an AB and what is God we must manifest that word in the evening time praise the Lord let them grow together at the time of harvest we shall separate the wheat from the tears at the time of harvest at the time appointed of God praise the Lord God will come to harvest that seat spoken word which he saw in the beginning he says remember Moses born for the work had to wait on God for the extra gift for the job he had to go back and wait for the time appointed of God a certain phoh had to be on the throne and the people had to be had had to be wanting the bread of life in other words the prophet is saying that God everything that is to come to pass must always come to pass at the appointed time we have received the message that there is going to be a rupture that is the promise praise the lord and there shall be Rapture praise the Lord and it says that so many people look at the signs they are looking for the signs because God gave the prophet signs praise the And when they see the signs have passed and the end has not come then they begin to criticize and say this is what you believe you say your Prophet said this but now it has happened and the rupture has not come praise the Lord the prophet said Moses had to wait he was born for the work and he had to deliver the people from from Egypt to the promised land but he could not do it until the time appointed was come praise the Lord and now we cannot force the rupture to come until the time appointed of God and God cannot Place signs before his word praise the Lord God puts his word first and all the signs come after it is the word of God so the only sign that we can look for for the Rapture is the word of God it is nothing else praise the Lord it is not the signs Bible says you shall hear of w and rumors of voice but said let your hearts not be dismayed praise the Lord so signs shall come but we are not looking for the signs we are looking for the manifestation of the words we are looking for the manifestation of the children of God and the Bible says even nature is groing nature is gring nature was created by the spoken word so it has the life of God nature is able to behold the things that are coming we have seen the prophet speak about many things he spoke about I think it's a tsunami that was going to to happen somewhere and then there were birs that began migrating and leaving that that place why because nature is able to read the signs praise the Lord and now the Bible says that that nature is groaning groaning for what waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting for the manifestation of the Bride of Jesus Christ and he says how can you tell me give me the word test how can you know speak the word see what they say about it if they don't believe the word they have no se in they are of the evil one praise the Lord but the bright praise the Lord though she was deceived at first the second bride was deceived they are deceivers of the third bride by hybriding the word or trying to God never placed signs ahead of his word God never plac s ahead of his words they were added for proof of the words but the word is the first to prove it Elijah said to the woman bake me a cake first then watch the miracle happen come to the word first then watch the miracle the SE word itself is what the Holy Spirit energizes and again he says let us stand like josua and C now let us stand like Joshua and C as we see the promised land coming Insight it's nearing the time to be given Joshua in Hebrew mean savior presents the promised time leader time leader to take the church over Cal represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua so no matter what the people say they had the seed they had the seed and the seed must bring forth its kind so they exhibited the kind of the seed they they did Bear the seed of The Word of Promise the spoken word that never fails once it goes forth it says they know God promised them a l it didn't matter whether there was a a sign or not suddenly the word had to stand and they stood right with it and the time appointed God gave them the land gave them the portion now notice how God did it not move Israel until his appointed time they may have say Joshua you lost your commission you're all washed up why are you not doing something you used to do you know the Lord in moment and what was the will of God but this wise God sent prophet Prophet knew the promise of God and also knew to wait for that promise a clearcut decision from God for his time and when the time come God gave it to Jos who had stayed with him by the word for he could not not trust others he trust him so will it repeat he says God gave the promise to Joshua because Joshua stayed with the word no matter the criticism that came he stayed true with the word praise the Lord and he says the same will have to repeat that God will give the promise praise the Lord to the bride who has stood with the word no matter the criticism he said God sent our prophet and the prophet said ABCD he said you said your Prophet said that a woman will rule America but now Trump has won your Prophet is a false prophet stay with the words stay with the spoken God once he speaks his words praise the Lord it must come to pass he promised us in Malachi 4 that before the coming of the second coming of Jesus Christ he will send the Elijah the prophet and Elijah the prophet is come and he he has come and he has BR he has brought the message he has brought the mind of God for us stay right with the mind of God regardless of the criticisms praise the Lord if they come and say you said ABCD you said that Russia will destroy America but now see what what America is doing America is sponsoring Ukraine and Ukraine is killing Russia and Russia is doing nothing that has nothing to do with the spoken word the word went forth and it must come to pass the prophet says regardless of whatever they said to Joshua they told him remember Joshua you could say says the Lord speak the word that we can take this land but he said stand still at the time appointed of the Lord shall take the land and I want say this that bride of Christ we are the word manifested stay with the word regardless of the criticisms we know that it shall come to pass that the Lord shall come and he shall take away the bride and this world shall be ruled this world shall be judged for their unbelief in the same words they are criticizing stay right with the word but whatever God has spoken it shall come to pass he spoke his word and whatever he spoke it came to pass in Genesis saw the seed and the seed has been going through the world until the last age of the Gentiles and this seed must come to maturity and this seed is in me and you and it must come to manifest praise the Lord the nature of the father praise the lord we must manifest the nature of the father because this word put on flesh once again God bless you Amen brother Moses amen let's get on our feet as brother Moses to give us a
