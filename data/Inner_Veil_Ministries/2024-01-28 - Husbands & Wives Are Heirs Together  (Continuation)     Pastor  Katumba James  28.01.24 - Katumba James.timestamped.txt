[0:01] you so he requires you to show it to
[0:05] express
[0:07] it praise the name of the Lord but not
[0:10] paying evil for
[0:13] evil but where they meet
[0:16] evil you pay with
[0:19] good pay with Good
[0:22] Will desire the best for the
[0:25] other praise the name of our Lord and
[0:28] this how we shall have our families
[0:29] together
[0:31] praise the name of our Lord so God has
[0:34] called us as husband and wife to be
[0:38] hairs
[0:41] together and hairs of good
[0:44] things hairs of the blessings of
[0:47] God haers of the promises that God has
[0:51] promised
[0:52] us as a husband and the
[0:54] wife and you see the Bible
[0:57] says that if the wife is
[1:02] grieved you know he can hinder the
[1:04] prayers of the
[1:07] husband because here you are two who
[1:11] have become
[1:12] one but then the other part is Grievious
[1:15] about what
[1:16] you so you need to see that you
[1:20] reconcile let your mind be
[1:23] one then the Bible says when you become
[1:28] angry don't allow the son to go over
[1:32] your you don't want to talk to the
[1:35] other come and eat
[1:39] food that's
[1:42] terrible don't create a bad environment
[1:44] for
[1:45] yourself and then you see sometimes when
[1:48] you try to say that I'm showing that I'm
[1:52] annoyed you may end up getting sickness
[1:54] out of
[1:57] it stress stress pressure this this you
[2:03] shouldn't do that learn to say in your
[2:07] heart know there are some
[2:12] people but the B says
[2:16] forgive unconditionally
[2:20] forgive whether he comes whether she
[2:25] whether he doesn't come or she doesn't
[2:28] come forgive
[2:30] and don't have a grudge in your
[2:33] heart yesterday she did this and this
[2:36] the other day he did this I'm no longer
[2:39] forgiving this one no no no
[2:42] no that's not a
[2:44] Christian but as a Christian learn to
[2:47] bear with your husband or
[2:52] wife helping your
[2:54] children you know they may hurt you
[2:57] certainly and let me say as we live
[3:01] together one way or another you hurt the
[3:05] other but now if every part every time
[3:08] we Hur one
[3:09] another you want to
[3:12] leave go back after they didn't
[3:16] me how are you going to raise your
[3:21] children so they also think about coming
[3:28] home even at
[3:31] home I will go I will go doesn't work
[3:34] like that but learn to bear with one
[3:39] another learn to be concerned about the
[3:42] other one's
[3:45] grien praise the name of our Lord let us
[3:48] go to
[3:51] Genesis chapter
[3:56] 21 and then verse
[3:58] 9
[4:01] so the Bible says and Sarah saw the son
[4:05] of Hagi the Egyptian which he had born
[4:08] unto Abraham more
[4:20] King wherefore she said Abraham cast out
[4:25] this born woman and her son for the son
[4:28] of this Bor woman shall not be with my
[4:32] son even with
[4:45] Isaac now you see trouble
[4:49] here it is Sarah who told Abraham
[4:52] produce a child
[4:57] with and Abraham went
[5:00] they got the child now when hag was
[5:04] pregnant started despising
[5:07] s and then sah had to just chase her
[5:10] away again she came back she gave
[5:13] birth and now here Sarah has given birth
[5:17] to
[5:20] Isaac and then ishma is despising
[5:25] is
[5:27] sah that she wouldn't with these people
[5:31] anymore and then she went the
[5:34] husband Cast
[5:36] [Music]
[5:37] Away this born
[5:39] woman and her son not your
[5:45] son but her
[5:48] son in other words I'm cutting him away
[5:51] from
[5:53] you chase them
[5:55] away for the son of this Bor woman
[6:00] shall not be here with my son even
[6:05] Isaac now you look at righteous
[6:09] Abraham the Bible says it was very
[6:13] [Music]
[6:15] Grievous in the sight of
[6:19] Abraham because of his
[6:22] son such troubles can come
[6:25] at but then what do you
[6:28] do Abraham so
[6:32] sorrowful so
[6:34] sad but the wife had taken a
[6:38] stand praise the
[6:40] name and these things happen at
[6:44] home you get a
[6:49] relative or you get a
[6:53] mate or you get a house
[6:56] help and then the other party says
[7:02] I don't want to find this person here at
[7:04] home but he's the one who helps
[7:08] me does
[7:11] this prise the name
[7:13] of like maybe you have a at home and
[7:17] then your wife says I don't want that
[7:20] girl
[7:22] around don't now start see what has she
[7:26] done don't start asking what has she
[7:32] praise the name of our Lord troubles
[7:35] keep on
[7:36] coming and sometimes maybe they are
[7:40] relatives you know maybe your brother or
[7:43] your sister or your wife says I don't
[7:46] want
[7:49] that now you see the situation that
[7:51] Abraham
[7:53] had his own side and because of thy born
[7:57] woman in all that sah has said unto thee
[8:01] Heen unto her voice for in Isaac shall
[8:05] thy seed be
[8:27] called now you see how it was tough for
[8:32] Abraham to send away
[8:36] ish but that's what would bring peace at
[8:40] home so then you need to seek what can
[8:43] bring peace at
[8:46] home praise the name of our Lord you
[8:48] need to seek what the solution
[8:52] here you know and then something can
[8:54] start from
[8:56] somewhere and then it brings a terrible
[8:58] arent
[9:01] the husband and the wife and then
[9:04] another will start thinking maybe the
[9:06] wife will start thinking because I'm a
[9:09] woman you think you think I don't have
[9:11] decisions to
[9:13] make and then the husband will think you
[9:16] are despising me and then now you start
[9:19] looking at other things you despising
[9:22] because you get more
[9:25] money then the wife can start thinking
[9:27] something else you are despising me
[9:30] because of
[9:32] ABCD shouldn't go those kind of
[9:35] far but then see how you can
[9:38] reconcile don't attach those things to
[9:41] other
[9:44] things and you see don't create room for
[9:47] the devil to come at
[9:50] your those
[9:52] differences don't allow it to go further
[9:56] otherwise they can exaggerate things
[10:00] and then you pile one thing on top of
[10:02] another one thing on top of another one
[10:04] thing on top of another one thing on top
[10:06] of another at the end of the day you
[10:10] find a small
[10:11] difference has become so
[10:16] wide until people don't want sleep on
[10:18] the same
[10:20] day terrible
[10:22] differences they don't want to sleep in
[10:24] the same
[10:26] bedroom ah the wife sleeps in the
[10:28] bedroom
[10:31] the husband sleeps where the children
[10:33] sleep or the husband sleeps in the
[10:35] sitting
[10:36] room terrible differences but yet you
[10:39] started something
[10:41] small that could easily be reconc so you
[10:44] don't hold the
[10:46] grud and you as a God-fearing
[10:50] person take the step of being
[10:55] humble be the one to be
[10:58] humilated
[11:01] allow allow to take the
[11:04] blame I am
[11:07] sorry or if the other part is demanding
[11:10] something and you find it is hard you
[11:14] find say okay let us do the way you are
[11:16] talking about you are allowed to take
[11:19] the
[11:21] pain praise the name of our allow to
[11:24] take the
[11:25] pain allow to take it upon you for the
[11:29] sake of winning the
[11:32] other praise the name of our Lord that
[11:35] you can live together so Abraham took
[11:38] the
[11:39] pain to let his son
[11:42] away to be able to have peace with
[11:45] Sarah and that's the same thing we
[11:47] should look at our
[11:49] homes our families differences can come
[11:52] up from
[11:54] anywhere but you know learn not to allow
[11:57] that difference
[12:00] to put you away because we are joint
[12:05] hairs praise the name of our we are
[12:08] joint and don't pick up a difference of
[12:10] the
[12:12] other you know every day she does
[12:17] this if you have talked about it why do
[12:20] you want to repeat it all the
[12:23] time praise the name of our Lord because
[12:26] the Bible says that if you repeat an
[12:31] even separate
[12:33] friends in other words you are
[12:34] continuously grieving the
[12:37] other until one one time one temper will
[12:42] just
[12:43] flare and then just
[12:47] shouts praise the name
[12:49] of if if the one is having a thing if
[12:53] one is having a
[12:56] San the noise of the sapan will tell you
[12:59] how hungry they
[13:06] are now you shouldn't reach that kind of
[13:09] level praise the name of our Lord we are
[13:12] called to be haers
[13:14] together people can live together
[13:17] in people can live together in
[13:21] harmony praise the name over and now let
[13:24] me say

[13:39] given there's no don't put
[13:43] imaginations I wish my wife looked like
[13:46] this so you want take her for
[13:51] plastic be
[13:53] content but my
[13:57] husband I wish this party had not like
[14:02] this be content with what God has and
[14:05] then pray to God and thank God for him
[14:09] thank God for
[14:10] her praise the name of our Lord and let
[14:14] me say another thing there is no better
[14:18] person who understands you better than
[14:21] your husband
[14:23] or no person is
[14:25] better to understand you better than
[14:29] your
[14:30] husband or your
[14:34] wife praise the name of our Lord so
[14:36] don't pray for the other to die

[14:50] guiding us Lord continue leading Us
[14:55] Praise the name of the Lord that's how
[14:56] home should be
[14:59] and then you know you
[15:01] age you know you are
[15:04] moving and you know you are just like
[15:06] you've
[15:07] started until when you count the number
[15:10] of years you've been
[15:11] with you get surprised hey we have made
[15:15] this number of
[15:16] years how has it
[15:18] been the way they says count your
[15:21] blessings and then you'll see what the
[15:23] Lord Has Done praise the name of our
[15:26] Lord let us learn to live in harmony
[15:29] with one another even when your wife is
[15:32] not
[15:33] believing even when your husband is not
[15:35] believing cherish her as the best
[15:38] cherish him as the best I love my wife I
[15:42] love my husband be happy with
[15:45] them praise the name of our be happy
[15:48] with them bear with them in their
[15:52] weaknesses we are joint hairs we are
[15:56] called be hairs together
[15:59] praise the name of our Lord so then
[16:01] whether they are in the body of Christ
[16:04] or they not in the body of
[16:07] Christ give them the respect as a
[16:09] husband or as a
[16:11] wife praise the name of our Lord and
[16:14] then they will have a
[16:16] testimony praise the name of our Lord
[16:18] and then you are raising children you
[16:20] are showing them an
[16:22] example praise the name of our Lord we
[16:25] need to see that we obey the of
[16:30] God and we do
[16:33] everything how the Lord wants us to
[16:36] do we go to Romans chapter
[16:40] 8 praise the name of our Lord Romans
[16:43] chapter 8 and then verse
[16:46] 17 the Bible
[16:49] says and if children then then hairs
[16:53] hairs of God and Joint hairs with Christ
[16:56] so be that we suffer with him that we
[16:59] may also be glorified
[17:17] together amen says we are hairs with
[17:23] Christ and if we are children we are
[17:26] join tears with him
[17:29] now that is in
[17:30] Salvation even now in our
[17:33] marriage the Bible says the Two Become
[17:38] One the two become
[17:40] one so when the two become
[17:43] one then they have the same
[17:48] position they have the same kind of
[17:51] things praise the name of our Lord you
[17:54] know you share the same
[17:55] food you eat of the same food
[17:59] like the Bible talks about in second
[18:03] Samuel and then chapter
[18:07] 12
[18:09] verse when the prophet naan was talking
[18:13] to David in a
[18:16] parable
[18:20] about whom he had
[18:23] taken because
[18:26] of so now here the Bible says in verse
[18:31] three but the poor man had nothing save
[18:35] one little e Lam which he had bought and
[18:39] nourished up and it grew up together
[18:42] with him and with his children it did
[18:45] eat of his own meat and drank of his own
[18:48] cup and lay in his bosom and was unto
[18:51] him as a
[18:57] daughter
[19:27] for
[19:36] amen now he's saying he's talking
[19:40] about and said now
[19:44] this was brought up had been
[19:50] bought and then nowed
[19:55] up and grew up together with him
[20:00] praise the name of Lord so husband and
[20:02] wife should also grow up
[20:06] together as your thinking
[20:09] changes let it move
[20:11] together praise the name of our Lord
[20:14] growing up
[20:15] together developing
[20:18] together you know you Desiring for each
[20:23] other praise the name of our Lord if you
[20:25] have bought for yourself shoes but also
[20:29] for your
[20:30] wife praise the name of our Lord if you
[20:33] want to eat good food let your wife also
[20:35] eat of the
[20:37] same you know there there are some
[20:42] people like in some places you go
[20:46] to you get early in the
[20:49] morning you know in some of those joints
[20:51] where they prepare
[20:53] food and then you get many
[20:57] there
[21:01] spting but when you go to their
[21:04] homes the the husband is too
[21:08] big his wife is too
[21:11] small even the
[21:14] children that's not
[21:17] right the other man can spend 5,000 or
[21:20] 10,000 a
[21:24] day but even 500 shs at home
[21:29] doesn't want to
[21:32] leave
[21:34] no they not consider
[21:37] it but then the Bible
[21:40] says she was eating of his own
[21:44] meat she was growing together
[21:47] with so
[21:50] everything
[21:53] had shared the and should be in our
[21:57] homes also
[21:59] praise the name of our Lord desire the
[22:01] best thing for your wife or for your
[22:06] husband that's what should be in your
[22:09] mind praise the name of our Lord not
[22:11] your own
[22:12] alone your own self every good thing me
[22:16] every good thing every good thing me we
[22:20] shouldn't take the spirit of
[22:23] hm he started thinking ah but who who
[22:27] can the king think about is me then he
[22:31] started lasting after the
[22:35] throne let the king's hor be given to
[22:40] him let the king's crown be put on
[22:43] himing
[22:49] person so we need to desire the best for
[22:51] the
[22:52] other not for our own selves but let the
[22:56] other first receive
[22:59] then I come in last praise the name of
[23:01] the Lord that's a right attitude to
[23:04] bring it to our
[23:06] home so ham after he had said all all
[23:10] his kind of deadd
[23:14] dreaming they told him prepare be first
[23:19] go do that
[23:20] to go do
[23:24] that his
[23:26] enemy come to
[23:30] H to H him on the
[23:35] he to seek the
[23:37] permission and then the Lord turned
[23:39] things around
[23:42] like praise the name of our Lord we need
[23:45] to desire the best for the
[23:48] other if I find something good let me
[23:51] desire for my my husband let me desire
[23:55] it for my
[23:56] wife praise the name
[23:58] and then you live in
[24:00] harmony you live in that kind of love of
[24:04] God and the Bible says love as
[24:08] Brethren you know you know your husband
[24:12] is the son of the
[24:16] king your your wife is the daughter of
[24:19] the
[24:21] king now if you take them as
[24:26] that praise the name of Allah like here
[24:30] we have a
[24:31] president the children are
[24:33] married now maybe one of the sons inw
[24:36] mistreats the
[24:39] daughter how the president
[24:42] feel even scares
[24:45] you that should be the same thing why
[24:47] should I treat the child of the
[24:50] king why should I treat the daughter of
[24:53] the king why should I treat the son of
[24:56] the king that is not
[24:59] pleasant praise the name of our Lord we
[25:02] need to have that
[25:03] conscience and see that let me do my
[25:06] part as f as I
[25:09] can God giving me
[25:12] Grace praise the name of and let us not
[25:15] be
[25:16] doing let us not be well
[25:19] doing but doing all that we
[25:22] can for the glory of the Lord praise the
[25:26] name of our Lord we are called to be
[25:29] haers
[25:31] together so then even the way we treat
[25:34] one
[25:36] another should be to the glory of
[25:39] God praise the name of our Lord let us
[25:42] go back to First Peter chapter 3 as I
[25:44] try to
[25:49] finish First Peter chapter
[25:53] 3 and then we read
[25:56] in
[25:58] in verse
[26:00] seven likewise ye husbands dwell with
[26:03] them according to knowledge giving honor
[26:07] unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel
[26:10] and as being hairs together of the grace
[26:12] of life that your prayers be not
[26:26] hindered
[26:36] amen says deal with them according to
[26:42] knowledge giving honor unto the
[26:46] wife now in Matthew chapter
[26:49] 19 and then verse
[26:53] seven they said unto him why did Moses
[26:56] then command to give a right of
[26:58] divorcement and to put her
[27:01] away Matthew
[27:20] 19:7 and he said unto them Moses because
[27:24] of the hardness of your heart
[27:28] suffered you to put away your wives but
[27:31] from the beginning it was not
[27:43] so now the Bible says because of the
[27:47] hardness of
[27:49] heart the hardness of heart of the
[27:53] husband and as a husband if you have
[27:55] hardness in your heart
[27:58] to watch your wife take it
[28:02] away be
[28:04] kind because the Bible says she's a
[28:06] weaker
[28:08] vessel but you are also a weak
[28:11] vessel but the other one is
[28:14] weaker so then you take away the
[28:16] hardness of the
[28:18] heart and then you see that you always
[28:20] seek the grace of
[28:23] God in the challenges that you are
[28:25] facing in your family
[28:29] praise the name of our Lord see that you
[28:31] seek the grace of God we have a stuation
[28:34] here come down and help out of this mess
[28:38] there's misunderstanding here come and
[28:41] help out of this
[28:42] misunderstanding thetion that is taking
[28:45] place here it's not
[28:47] pleasant come and you know solve it and
[28:51] then you allow the Lord to take over
[28:53] your
[28:54] situation and then you pray for one
[28:56] another
[28:57] you seek the Lord for one another Lord
[29:00] help my husband Lord help my
[29:04] wife and then you desire the best for
[29:07] the
[29:08] other praise the name of the Lord and
[29:11] then you don't come to your husband you
[29:13] don't come to your wife despising them
[29:17] no the Bible says giving
[29:20] honor you know respecting one
[29:24] another and you know sometimes the devil
[29:26] always wants to bring in
[29:29] things to make people at
[29:32] Lads but it should not be so praise the
[29:36] name of our Lord you know there
[29:37] shouldn't be
[29:40] hardness there shouldn't be unforgiving
[29:44] spirit and you know when you don't
[29:47] forgive you are
[29:52] tormented if you don't
[29:55] forgive you are tormented
[29:58] you may I'm not
[29:59] tormented but the Bible say the
[30:04] servant
[30:09] dat when he refused to forgive a fellow
[30:15] dat because the other man had only
[30:20] 500 and he was failing to pay the de
[30:23] then another had
[30:26] 50,000 and he was failing to pay the
[30:28] debt and then he went to the king and
[30:30] started saying oh King forgive me I'm
[30:34] failing my businesses are failing you
[30:37] know somehow there are failures that
[30:39] come in life and then you seek Mercy
[30:42] from the Lord Lord forgive me and then
[30:46] the Lord forgives me so when the other
[30:48] servant of 50,000 was
[30:50] forgiven he went to a fellow
[30:54] servant whom was demanding 500
[30:57] and said Pay me then the fellow servant
[31:00] told him please be merciful to him be
[31:04] merciful to him he said no no no pay me
[31:08] pay me pay me now the other servants
[31:11] went and told the
[31:13] king this man you've
[31:16] forgiven is's not forgiving the other
[31:19] the king called this man said I call
[31:24] you said for you if I forgiven you
[31:28] much why don't you forgive this little
[31:32] and that's what the Lord looks at us he
[31:34] has forgiven us much why don't we
[31:37] forgive one another forgive your
[31:40] children forgive your parents forgive
[31:43] your husband forgive your wife
[31:47] why and so what the scripture says the
[31:51] Lord appointed
[31:55] tormentors to tment this man until he
[32:00] pays and the
[32:02] tormenters they are
[32:04] demons you don't forgive demons just
[32:07] come in your
[32:09] heart and they torment
[32:12] you praise the name of our Lord learn to
[32:16] forgive so the Bible says because of the
[32:19] hardness of
[32:23] heart but now the hardness of heart has
[32:27] has been taken care
[32:28] of by the blood of Jesus Christ praise
[32:32] the name of our Lord where there is
[32:34] hardness in my heart let me apply the
[32:37] blood of
[32:38] Jesus because the blood of Jesus Christ
[32:41] there is
[32:42] nothing it can't work
[32:45] on praise the name of the Lord the blood
[32:48] of Jesus Christ works on all our
[32:51] condition if we can only bring them to
[32:53] the Lord and say Lord have mer Lord help
[32:57] me to reconcile with my husband Lord
[33:00] help me to reconcile with my wife Lord
[33:02] help me to reconcile with my
[33:04] parents concern with my children say
[33:07] that everybody can be free with
[33:10] you not having anything
[33:13] against and that's what God has called
[33:15] us as children of
[33:17] God may God bless
[33:19] you amen
[33:24] amen let us sing a song and then we can
[33:26] pray
