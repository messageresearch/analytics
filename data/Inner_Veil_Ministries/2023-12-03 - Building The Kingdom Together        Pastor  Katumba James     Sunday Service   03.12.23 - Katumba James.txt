commit those to be with us today remember sister and number of them Lord may your grace reach unto them we love you and we thank you speak to us through your word in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen let us go to Daniel chapter 2 Daniel chapter 2 we are reading from verse 44 up to 45 so the Bible says and in the days of these Kings shall the king of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as those so a stone cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation there may God bless of his word you may be seated so this morning we have only one service but immediately after this service we going to have the youth meeting for just one hour so I want to preach this morning building the kingdom together praise the name of the Lord our pastor has been taking us through the CES of the Kingdom praise the name of our Lord and then you know how we told you know like in John chapter 14 where the Bible says in my father's house are many mansions and the and the house meant a kingdom praise the name of our Lord and then now the Mansion are the positions or the places we occupy in the body of Jesus Christ now here when we look at this scripture we have read Nebuchadnezzar was the king at that time when the children of Israel were in captivity actually it is Nebuchadnezzar who took the children of Israel into captivity praise the name of our Lord and then we see at that time from the time the kingdoms of the Gentiles started ruling over Israel or started having dominion over Jerusalem that's where the times of the Gentiles started from and we can see that from the time of Nebuchadnezzar up to now it is the Gentile kingdoms that are having rule over Jerusalem you can imagine Israel now that their Capital according to the world capital city is not Jerusalem but it is and then the world Nations has declared Jerusalem to be an international City in other words Jerusalem doesn't belong to the Jews so it is still under the Dominion of the Gentiles you find that East Jerusalem where many historical sites are is ruled by the Palestinians or the Muslim nations like you can imagine the Temple Mount is being ruled by either Jordan or Lebanon not Israel itself so you see that there we are still having the Gentile times praise the name of the Lord and they started in the times of Nebuchadnezzar now we see that Nebuchadnezzar he had a dream and when he had that dream he forgot the dream and then Daniel sought the Lord and then the lord gave him the interpretation of the dream praise the name of and you see the way God works that even during the times of Joseph Pharaoh had a dream so you see how the Lord works that he even uses world leaders to show them what is going to be to prepare for the Times ahead if far didn't have that dream and maybe somebody else had a dream maybe the preparations wouldn't have been but faraoh being the ruler of the world he got a dream and then he left the interpretation and then Joseph came and gave the interpretation saying that there are going to be seven years of plentiful Harvest and then there will be another seven years of fine so now it was in the heart of faraoh to make such preparations praise the name of our Lord to prepare for such a season now brother Bram teaches us God cannot give you a dream of symbols and signs if he has not put there a person to interpret it praise the name of our Lord but we see we are living in a time that many people get dreams and they always seek interpreters you know then there's a church called dream Church in then there is another one in they say we come with your dreams and we tell you what they mean but when God does not put there somebody to interpret those symbols he will give you an open dream like Joseph the husband of Mary he got a dream when he was thinking of putting Mary aside then God told him then you told him don't fear to take Mary it was an open dream the three wise men when they had gone to visit to worship Christ and the Lord knew what Herod was planning but then God came at night and then told them don't go by the same way go by another way and then even now Joseph he also got a dream the Lord told telling him take the child to Egypt so God gives us an open dream praise the name of our Lord and then you know some people want to best their decisions on the dreams they make but some dreams can be correct some dreams can be false so you shouldn't build your life based on dreaming we have the word of God where we can build our life praise the name of our Lord you check your dream with the word of God praise the name of our Lord and let the word of God be our guidance all the time so now we see here in the scriptures that in Daniel chapter 2 praise the name of our Lord let us go follow up that dream of Nebuchadnezzar verse 36 it says this is the dream and we will tell the inter ration thereof to the king king at the King of Kings for the Lord of Heaven has given you a kingdom power and strength and glory and whereever the children of men dwell the Beast of the field of the hair has given in thine hand and has made you ruler over all though at the head of God because nebz saw the head of God and then he saw the breasts and arms of silver and then he saw the belly and the thighs of brass and then he saw the legs and the feet of iron and [Music] Clay now these were four Gentile kingdoms that were going to lose the world until Christ comes down to L the world praise the name of our Lord so then what we are what we see here from the time of Nebuchadnezzar up to now we are still under those four kingdoms because Christ has not come to take over the millennial reign of this world now the first kingdom was Babylon the head of God praise the name of the Lord and then now Daniel interpreted this dream that you are the head of God in verse 39 and after you shall arise a kingdom inferior to you and another third Kingdom of the brass which shall bear rule over the earth now we see that it is in the times of Daniel that the king the first kingdom was fulfilled and it was still in the time of Daniel that the second Kingdom succeeded the first Kingdom which was the Babylonian Kingdom when we go to Daniel chter 5 and then verse 30 the Bible says in that night was Bel the king of and Darius the median took the kingdom being about three and years old so now the media and persan kingdom was the kingdom of the breast and the arms of silver is the kingdom that succeeded the Babylonian Kingdom now we see that Satan here also has been building his kingdom praise the name of the Lord from one Kingdom to another kingdom you know he from the ruling over the world and taking over the leadership of Jerusalem started by the Babylonian King and then he went into the persan kingdom which were the arms and the breast of silver and then from the Persian Kingdom he went to the Greece Kingdom which was actually the Bell and the size of brass now from the Greek Kingdom then he comes to the Roman Kingdom which at the legs of iron and feet of legs and feet of clay and iron praise the name of our Lord and now we are still living under the Roman Kingdom according to the scriptures our Lord Jesus Christ was born under the Roman Kingdom the first coming of the Lord he comes when the Roman Kingdom and now the second coming of the Lord he comes when to still the Roman Kingdom and even now during the third coming of the law he comes when the Roman Kingdom to destroy the all of it and establish his rule on Earth so right now we are still living under the Roman Kingdom Under the scriptures in the days of Jesus Christ the Roman kingdom was an emperor Rome it was being ruled by the empires you know the Emperors but during the ages it turned from the Emperors to the pope praise the name of our Lord they are still the rulers of the world now they got into the spiritual aspect and now in Revelations chapter 13 the Bible tells us that the Beast is going to rule the world and everything is gearing up to that to make sure that the Beast the man of sin lules the world we are still living under the Roman Empire but our Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says where we've read in Daniel chapter 2 that I saw a stone praise the name of our that was cut without hands let us go to Daniel 2:35 let us start from verse let us start from verse 31 get the background though oh King sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before them and the form thereof was ter this image's head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his Bell and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet and part of iron and part of clay though so is still a stone was cut out without hands which smot the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broken to pieces together and became like the cha of the saming FL and the wind carried them away and no place was found for them and the stone and the and the stone that smot the image became a great mountain and fill the whole [Music] earth praise the name of the Lord so we see that all the king OMS of the world praise the name of our Lord they all all the powers that have been have been able to congregate into or to sum up in the last Kingdom until when the stone is cut it comes and destroys all the components which were in the first Kingdom bonian Kingdom second Kingdom the made pers Kingdom the third Kingdom that was the Greek Kingdom and the fourth Kingdom which is the Roman Kingdom now I want us just relate this with another scripture here let us go to Daniel chapter 7 praise the name of the Lord and then we look at verse one he says in the first of Bel king of Babylon Daniel had the dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the of the [Music] matters Daniel SP SP and said I saw in my vision by night and behold the Four Winds of Heaven stood upon the great sea and four great beasts come from the sea diverse one from another now he says he saw great beasts four great beasts come out of the Sea and the Bible tells us praise the name of the Lord in Revelation chapter 17 praise the name of the Lord and then verse and he said unto me the waters which th sest where the was sth are the peoples and the multitudes and the Nations and the towns and then Daniel says I saw great beasts and the Beast can also stand for power come out of the sea what is the sea people Nations tongues so he says I saw beasts coming out and then he says the first Beast was like a lion and then verse five and another Beast the second one was like a bear and then verse six it says and the third Beast was like leopard and then s and I saw in the night vision Behold a fourth Beast so we see that the first Beast here in in Daniel 7 verse4 which was like a lion was the Babylonian Kingdom and then the second beast which was like a bear was the made persan Kingdom and then we see that the third Beast which was like a Le was like that Greek Kingdom and then the seventh the fourth Beast the fourth Beast which was Dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly was the Roman Kingdom now you see that all these Powers the lion you know the power of that Beast which was like Lion the powers of the Babylonian Kingdom and then the median Kingdom then the Greek Kingdom they all congregate into the fourth Beast the Roman Kingdom and we go to Revelations 1 and then verse one praise the name of our Lord the Bible says and I stood up upon the sand of the [Music] sea and so a beast rise up out of the sea and we said the sea is what people this same is matching with Daniel and then he says having seven heads and 10 horn and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his head the name of B now look at verse and now this Beast is being described and he said I saw it like a Le Greek Kingdom praise the name of the Lord and the feet were of a bear Persian Kingdom and the mouth like a mouth of a lion Babylonian Kingdom and the dragon which is Satan gave him his power and his seat and great Authority praise the name of the Lord so all the devil has been building building his kingdom and brother Bram teaches us Satan has also been working on his Eden he has been building his Eden for 6,000 years the way God took 6,000 to make the Garden of Eden even Satan has been taking 6,000 to build his enemy at the end of his Eden he wants to rule the world and now he fulfills it in the times that we are living praise the name of our Lord that there is a union of religions all of them coming together to do what to Crown the [Music] Beast praise the name of our Lord and then in Revelation 13:8 here is wisdom let te that has understanding count the number of the Beast for it is the number of a man and his name is 6003 and6 so the Beast is a man praise the name of our Lord in the beginning in Genesis in the Garden of Eden the Beast was the serent but we saw what the serpent did that was able to get his seed to bring forth King and now we see that in the end time the Beast is a man and he comes from among many people and when you read Revelation 17 and 18 the woman sits on the B and the woman is the Fallen Church mystery Babylon sitting on the man leading and then the man sits on the seat of Satan and great Authority and power is given unto him so now the devil has been building his kingdom but as the devil builds his kingom even God has been building praise the name of God has also been building his as the devil builds his God has also been building this King now we need to ask our Sinners of whose kingdom are you praise the name of the Lord of whose kingdom are you of whose building are you of whose Temple are you praise the name of our the devil has been building his and his climax is when he's worshiping by all the nations and it is going to come to pass that for 3 and a half years they will worship the devil whoever will not worship the devil will be put to death that's the scripture here let us read Revelations chapter 13 pray the name of our Lord and then verse four and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the [Music] Beast praise the name of Lord who is like the dragon who is like the Beast so we need to check ourselves where is your heart now praise the name of our Lord where is your heart's desire where are your intent do you worship Science and Technology do you worship education do you worship your wealth do you worship your culture or you worship your religion or you worship the true Living God praise the name of our Lord so now let us go back to Daniel chapter 2 praise the name of the Lord Daniel 2 and then verse 35 so the Bible says then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer th FL and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that M the image became a great mountain and filled the whole [Music] earth praise the name of the Lord so the says the stone SM the image the SM sm all the kingdoms of the world in Revelations chapter 19 Christ coming down on the White Horse and takes over all the kingdoms of the world at the end of this world and so the Bible says that stone became a great mountain and filled the whole Earth let us go to verse 44 and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and shall stand forever praise the name of the Lord so he says in the days of these Kings which Kings the kingdoms of this world God has been establishing his kingdom praise the name of our Lord God has been been getting members for his kingdom as the gospel has been going forth he has been getting members he has been recruiting members of his kingdom people who were turning away from sin people were turning away from Evil you know they were getting into the kingdom of God so God has been going through getting his members for his kingdom making them New Creations in Christ filling them with the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord are you part of that Kingdom praise the name of the Lord we are children of the king we are part of the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord the one that the Bible says our citizenship is in heaven praise the name of our just as you a citizen here you become a citizen by birth so even in heaven you become a citizen by the new bir praise the name of our Lord by the birth with our Lord Jesus Christ by being born from above so now the Bible is telling in the days of this King God has been setting up his King so now the question comes to us are you part of that kingdom are you part of the Heavenly Kingdom or you are just thinking about the kingdom of this now if you are part of the kingdom of God praise the name of you have become a building Stone praise the name of our Lord you have become part of the temple of God and then the Bible says we are Lively Stones praise the name of our Lord we are living stones of the kingdom of God we are living stones of of the temple of God let us go to First Peter chapter 2 and then verse 5 praise the name of our Lord First Peter chapter 2 and then verse five so the Bible says you also are Lively Stones I built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus [Music] Christ the Bible says we are Lively Stones we are building a spiritual house we are under construction we are building the kingdom of God the name of our Lord we are Lively Stone why it is the spirit of God that dwells in Us Praise the name of our Lord It's the spirit of God that we have given our lives to and the Lord have given you all my life take over all my life praise the name of the Lord that you are no longer yourself but it is the spirit of God that is living in you making you a lively St and then you are building a spiritual house praise the name of our Lord like in the Old Testament when they were building the Temple praise the name of our Lord let us go to First Kings chapter 5 praise the name of the Lord First Kings 5 and verse 18 so the Bible says and Solomon's Builders and Ham's Builders did H them let us start from verse 17 and the King commanded and they brought great Stones costly stones and held stones to L the foundation of the house the Bible says they were great Stones costly they had already been caught from different rocks all over the world and then the Bible says in verse 18 and Solomon's Builders and Ham's Builders did H them and the stone squares so they prepared the Timber and the stones to build the house praise the name of the Lord they were preparing to build the temple but they picked stones from different areas they went in different countries they were picking Stones praise the name of Allah like maybe they would go to this Village and then they pick a stone they go to another Village they pick a stone they go to another country they pick a stone and this is what the Lord is doing now praise the name of our Lord he's picking a stone maybe comes to your CL you are the only stone that he picks praise the name of our Lord maybe comes to your class and you the only Stone he picks maybe comes you know to your kind of of profession whatever you're doing and you the only one he picks they were picking them from different places praise the name of our Lord and then they brought them to Jerusalem praise the name of our Lord we are Lively stones and they were picking them at different times different seasons praise the name of our Lord building the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible in First Kings 6 and verse 7 and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought here so that there was neither hmer nor axe nor any tool of iron had in the house while it was in the building now you look at the inspiration of God look at the leadership of God different Builders different servants we are sent out in different places go you to all the World praise the name of our Lord and preach this gospel this Gospel of the Kingdom shall reach to All Nations why getting those livel stones together praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says when they brought them for construction in Jerusalem no stone was cut no stone was sh but where they were picked from by by inspiration of God they had a position to feel in the body of Jesus Christ and each and every one of us as a Lively Stone we have a place to fit in the king praise the name of our Lord now start asking yourself which place do you fit in the king praise the name of Lord which position are you in the body of Christ if you have recognized your position then you are in the building and you are able to build the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord now in the message Elisha the prophet he says and no matter where the person is that is a Believer God in some way will get the true message to them just as certain as he is God scattered Stones different places maybe it is a stone that is at a drinking joint maybe it a stone that's in a prostitute house maybe it is a stone that at a witchcraft is place as long as he orain of God that stone will also be picked up to build the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord he says that is right he will manage to get it somewhere he will put an ech on somebody's heart somewhere they will write to them they will hear a testimony they will turn the radio on or something another they will hear the true message God will grant that to them praise the name of God he knows where this stones are now as we have identified ourselves we need to participate in the building of this Temple praise the name of the Lord we need to build together this Tabernacle we need to build together this Kingdom if you have identified yourself as part of the Kingdom there is still another stone that is outside we need to see how we can go and pick those stones to get the stones in praise the name of our Lord we need to build the kingdom together praise the name of our Lord now in this message the dedication of the building it says remember the SAS was cut out in Lebanon fled to how to J by oats to Jerusalem the tall seders of Lebanon which is overlaid with gold in the temple there was not a sound so there was not a sound of a s somewhere here is one thing that they did and that's one thing the church is doing today The Ting of the first Tabernacle a stationary Tabernacle from being 10 to 10 to place to place he says they started the building and they went so far and they found out a funny looking Stone it was an OD Stone it didn't look like the rest of this and they rejected it and throw it over into the we pile they said that stone won't fit in this building and they picked it out in the we pile but they kept coming up to a certain place they kept running into a place and after a while they had a hall in the [Music] building and they didn't have nothing would fit it that's where you churches is to go today your denomination you built and you've plastered and got your buildings but you find there is a hall there somewhere what did they find the stone that was rejected s Jesus is the chief cornner praise the name of our Lord in building of the first Tabernacle the Temple of Solomon you know every stone was picked from a different place and then they brought them to Jerusalem and then when the builders started building they looked at a furn stone and they couldn't understand it then they bu said no this Stone let us put it away and then they kept on building now when they reached at the completion they found there was a space somewhere but the building had already been built now when they looked at it carefully the stone which was so funny the stone which the builders rejected was meant to be the chief corner and that was our Lord Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ in your heart that's now the question if Christ is not in your heart you're not part of the kingdom of God until Christ comes and be part of you that's when you can say I'm a Lively Stone I'm part of the kingdom of now in the temple of Solomon the Chief Cornerstone in Psalms 118 praise the name of our Lord Psalms 118 and then verse 28 22 the Bible says the stone which the builders refused is become the head of the corner this is the Lord is doing it is marvelous in our eyes praise the name of the Lord they rejected the stone God never gave them inspiration at that time that this is what you start with but they rejected it what was it it was a prophecy that this Temple they building is going to be broken praise the name of the Lord and the temple was broken but now here we are building a spiritual house praise the name of our Lord and we had the spiritual Stone this Temple we are building there will be no rejected Stone praise the name of our Lord in this Temple we are building there will be no unopen place why everybody will fit in their position praise the name of our Lord in this Temple we are building praise the name of our Lord and brother Bram says praise the name of our Lord the Rapture cannot take place until the last one has comeing praise the name of our Lord so you may start asking what are we doing here we are looking for the last praise the name of our Lord like yesterday in place called they baptized 11 people it's a new church hardly 3 months old it is in a brother's house he has over 20 people coming to church and 11 people were baptized and then there is a brother he believed this message last year praise the name of our Lord and invited him to come and preach here but every weekend is moving out looking for those Stone praise the name of our so on Friday he left his place he came TOA and then he spent a night in for PTO then yesterday morning he went deep into cabar and yesterday he baptized 100 30 people praise the name of our looking for the stones to build this Temple now the issue is where is your participation praise the name of our Lord is sacrificing sometimes no money to go there sometimes the children are being chased from school sometimes children are sick what are you doing to build the kingdom of praise the name of the Lord where will your reward be praise the name of our Lord oh you only interested in having eternal life but no reward we are building the kingdom together what is your participation into the kingdom praise the name of the Lord and there's no part of the body which is useless every joint supplying what are you supplying praise the name of the Lord what connection are you putting there into this Kingdom we are building the kingdom what is your contribution into this Kingdom God has blessed you God has given you eternal life God has given you good health God has given you what you do but yet there is somebody who is in need and the kingdom of God support like this brother I don't know how much money could have spent all through from from to most of those have broken up now he has to come this way then get continue up go in those Hills and those people don't have water as close as we have water here sometimes baptizing the the money is a lot what are you doing to support the kingdom of God praise the name of the Lord you God has saved you God has given you good health God has given you unemployment but what are you doing where is your contribution to build the kingdom praise the name of where is your contribution what is your joint supplying praise the name of like our pastor has been doing a lot of mission Through The Years praise the name over and from this church many churches have seted up all over the country even in other countries do you have the same vision do you have the same burden because we need to share the burden we can't give the burden to him alone but we need to come around and say let us support the vision God has given you may not accompany him to the mission field but what are you doing like the brother went to cabar yesterday if you hear about that what are you doing are you able to say let me pray for him or I have some money here let him send money he's spending his time in the missions but when for you working and generating your money which is good your mind is to store more more more and the Bible say all the silver all the gold all the iron all the timber were all ground to nothing [Music] but when you bring a sword to the kingdom it is eternal praise the name of when you bring a soul the kingdom it is eternal so when the world is vanished when the world is not there at least you can show I brought this one to Christ what have you done in building the kingdom of God praise the name of what have you done praise the name of the Lord let us go to MTH 25 and then verse 14 and the King shall answer and say unto them very very I say unto you in so much as you have done this unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me at the end of the day when Christ is sitting on the throne time to judge how will you be judged praise the name of the Lord how will you give accountability of your life on Earth how will you give accountability of your riches you've got how will you give accountability of the time God has given you first he has given you life and as he has given you life he has given you time and as he has given you time he gives you possession how are you using these things and how are you going to give accountability of these things establish your own kingdom all the kingdom of God praise the name of the Lord we need to have that burden to see that we build the kingdom together to see that we come up and put our hands together let us look at praise the name of the Lord let us go to Exodus CH 25 praise the name of the Lord Exodus 25 and then verse one the Bible says and the Lord spoke unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart he shall take my offering and this is the offering in which you shall take of them gold silver brass and blue and purple and Scarlet and fine linen and God's hair and RAM skins dyed red and bger skins and shitty mood all for Delight spices for anointing and for the sweet incense and Oak stones and stones to be set in the eort and in the breastplate for he says give me an offering willing heart and then he mention the needs why he says and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them we want God to dwell Among Us are we making him a sanctuary praise the name of Are We offering our bodies unto him offer your body as a living sacri be filled with the Holy Spirit be part of the kingdom it says let them offer willingly whatever the Lord has blessed you with put it in the Kingdom support the work of the Kingdom why you want God to be in your M you want God to bless you praise the name of our Lord what are you doing to bring the presence of God in your life to bring the presence of God in your family what are you doing what is your participation what is your contribution we need to build the kingdom together and so Moses was saying the children of Israel come and participate in the construction of the sanctuary you want God to come in your home you want God to come in your life what is your contribution what are you giving in and then he says bring gold bring silver bring brass praise the name of our offer to the Lord willingly praise the name of our Lord and then we see here in verse 36 rather in chapter 36 and then verse 1 to verse 7 the bible says let us start from verse three let start from verse one okay then wrote Bal and a AIA and every wise-hearted man in whom the Lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the son Sanctuary according to all that the Lord had commanded and Moses called bzel and aor and every wise-hearted man in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom even everyone whose heart steered him up to come unto the work to come up and do the work and they received of Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary to make it with and they brought yet unto him free offerings every [Music] morning and and all the wise men that wrote all the work of the sanctuary came every man from his work which they [Music] made and they spoke unto Moses saying the people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the Lord commanded to make and Moses gave commandment and they caus it to be proclaimed throughout the camp saying let neither man nor a woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary so the people were restrained from bringing for the stuff that was was sufficient for all the work to make it and too praise the name of the Lord a call was given bring to make the sanctuary and people were so willing the Bible says they brought too much and they said no we have got enough but the mission field has not got enough praise the name of the Lord be part of it praise the name of the Lord like every time we get requests I want this I want to go and do this Mission I want to go in the other place these people want btis but they don't have transport I want to go the other side but I'm stuck until literally the money you have you pull it out but the burden is not to one person or to a few individuals the burden is for the whole body and as a whole church we need to have that same body praise the name of Lord don't wait to be told oh there is the other brother who St isant to do this willfully given for the work of the Lord praise the name of our Lord willfully giving abundantly and then the Bible says bring all the Tes and offering that my house has full praise the name of so you start asking yourself am I faithful in paying my tit am I faithful in bringing my offerings and now those things support here how about the missions praise the name of our Lord how about those people who are in need it has been raining and many of these hundreds of churches they don't have shelter some of them we b t tapings and they are all Tor up and they need tapings in hundreds of them we need to share the burden we need to build the kingdom of God the Bible says here people brought in much how much have you given him in the building of the temple and this work is continuous it is continuous and as one place is touched then from that one place many come up and then the need keeps on growing praise the name of our and then for the young men how many of you are willing to participate to go out in those mission how many then how many Hors how many Prophet Prophet Hors let us go read in Luke Chapter 2 praise the name of our Lord Luke Chapter 2 and then verse 36 the Bible says and there was one an a prophetes the daughter of fenry of the tribe of Assa she was of a great age and had lived with her husband 70 years from her virginity and she was a widow of about four SC and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with

from morning to evening and when you on those things even you don't become hungry because your mind is in it now why don't you turn that time why don't you turn it and then you give it to the Lord reading the word meditating upon the word and thanking God Lord I Thank you for what you've given me today I thank you for speaking to my heart and then you see that your heart is in line with God and then you pray but Lord there is this request Lord there is this need Lord there is this problem Lord there is this God has spoken to you now you are talking back then he talks to you then you talk back praise the name of the Lord but here we are talking with Twitter and then Twitter talks no I want something about this so you you search you are talking to it I want this kind of thing you're talking to it then when you gole or when you do such then it talks back to you oh there is this design there is this kind of SC there is this kind of beauty there this kind of fashion it's talking back to you and then for it knows how to give you a lot you spend I've not finished what I'm doing why don't you convert that time and you give it to the Lord what are you doing you are building the kingdom you are participating in the construction you are giving your life you giving your time you may not have any money to give but whatever God has blessed you praise the name of like there are some of these new ministers not only new ministers even elderly ministers in different places you find them the best shirt is putting on a tie the col is all Tor you look at him the shoes is putting

shoes to these brother but you know now there are some people most especially ladies she can buy a shoe and doesn't even wear it the whole year every maybe is buying there's one who had a lot of pairs of shoes maybe 100 PS for what give to that who lacks praise the name of the Lord the Bible has told us in MTH 25 verse 40 as much as you did it the least of them you have done it praise the name of let us be concerned about the body participate in the construction praise the name of our Lord be like Anna in your personal life taking time the Bible also talks about Simeon that he waited for the consolation of Israel he was always waiting on the Lord and the Holy Spirit was how about you at home all the time fings and endless fings all radio programs do things in your ear all the time the music you hear oh you know you are with your friend conversing this conversing this this this this kind of why are you building your own kingdom which is going to be destroyed why don't you participate in the building of the kingdom of God that's not going to be Des praise the name of our Lord so let us go back to MTH chapter 25 and then verse 45 so the Bible says then shall he answer them saying very I say unto you in as much as you did not to one of the least of these you did it not to me what a disappointment you've hipped up riches for yourself you bought the other thing you bought the other thing you have too much until you waste it when another is going hungry and you're not concerned somebody doesn't have food somebody doesn't have this so it's wasteful and then the Lord says just as you didn't do it to them you have not done it unto me and brother Bram teaches in the message that day on Calvary that eternal life is living for others praise the name of our Lord living for others is eternal life so start asking how many are you living for at your home where you stay where you study from where you work from are you able to see that you give your life for the Salvation of somebody else taking time talking to somebody about Christ taking time praying for somebody taking time interceding for somebody picking from what you have and helping another praise the name of Jesus didn't come to live for himself but he came to live for us to die for us that we can be like him and if we have the same Spirit of Christ we shall live for others if we have the same Spirit of Christ we shall participate in the Kingdom of praise the name of our Lord where you give your life praise the name of our Lord and you know like on the day of Pentecost when Peter had preached they asked him men and Brethren what shall we do praise the name of the Lord what shall I do praise the name of the Lord where am I participating what is my contribution to the kingdom of we need to build the kingdom together and don't leave it to the other how about you if you are part of it be concerned praise the name of the Lord be concerned pray about it intered find out the needs give to the needs Supply praise the name of our Lord let us go to First coronal chapter 28 1 chonicles chapter 28 and then we read from verse 11 praise the name of the Lord the Bible says then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch and of the houses thereof and of the treasures thereof and of the upper chambers thereof and of the inner Palace thereof and of the place of the M SE and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit of the Courts of the house of the Lord and of all the chambers round about and of the treasuries of the house of God and of the treasuries of theed [Music] things now God revealed to David the way God showed Moses a vision of the Tabernacle is going to build even here God revealed to David by the Holy Spirit the temple that he wants them to build so now David got the pattern and then he wrote it down and then he gave it to Solomon and then here the Bible says in verse 19 all this said David the Lord made me to understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern so God showed him praise the name of the Lord the pattern and then he got that pattern and then he came and shared it with the people like Moses when he got the pattern he came and shared it with the people we need Builders you know like you know like different men were anointed to come and participate in this world praise the name of and even now we are building a kingdom we need different people to come and participate in this you need to participate in the building of the we need to build this Kingdom together it's not left to only one person praise the name of our Lord and don't sayh I believe the other one can give me I cannot give no there was that widow woman who had only one meal left and then the prophet of God went to her give me first how about you do you esteem the other more than yourself or it is first my need oh first my need first my children first my wife first my family first my body do you put your need aside and then say let the others need prevail that's what Elijah was telling the we give me first and then the Bible says when she made the meal from where she Drew from the oil and the wheat they never se you also need to have that kind of faith that Lord I'm giving my all and believing that you repen all that I have need of the name of our Lord you know people want to receive but are you giving praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says it is more blessed to give than to receive praise the name of our you know in the world God has given us things to look at this L of Victoria it receives water from mountains in Kenya receives water from Rivera now if L Victoria was only receiving it will be a dead Lake but when Lake Victoria Rees it gives River takes all the way to the mediterian Sea you know they are dead legs like we have here in Western Uganda then there is the Dead Sea they just receive and there's no life in them why do you have why would you want to have no life in you me give me what are you giving you become a dead L just on receive like Beggars like in London there was a beggar who was just begging and whatever he would beg he put there put there put there and when he died when they went to his place they got 2 million what was the use of that shouldn't be Beggars praise the name of our Lord we should do people who give praise name of our Lord and so when there is a need like there was a need to build the temple praise the name of our Lord and then David he came out in second cor first Corin chapter 29 and then verse 6 says then the chief of the fathers and the princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousand and of hundreds with the rulers of the king is offered willingly they offered willingly why they are building the Temple together we also need to build the temple together praise the name of our Lord verse seven and gave for the service of the house of God we need to give for the work of the Kingdom support the work of the king and then in verse 9 then the people rejoiced for that they had offered willingly because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord and the King also Rejoice with the Great Joy praise the name of our Lord they offered now if we continue reading here the Bible says wherefore David blessed the Lord and all the congregation and said blessed be the Lord God of Israel our of our father forever and ever thine oh Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in heaven and is in Earth is thine thine is the kingdom oh Lord th are exalted above all both riches and hor come of thee and th re over all and in thy hand is the power and the might in thy hand is the to make great and to give strength unto all now therefore Our God we thank thee and praise thy glorious name but whom am I and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this thought for all things come of thee and of thine have we given they received and then they gave we receive are we giving praise the name of our we need to build the kingdom together praise the name of the Lord what God has blessed you with put it in the Kingdom praise the name of the Lord and we don't have the ability to come here every Sunday to remind you about that no praise the name of Lord but get the Revelation that the kingdom the missionary work the services of the

waiting to have that meal praise the name of how much have you put into the king there are so many needs praise the name of our Lord we need to get another camera another video camera and it's in millions of sh how much are you contributing we have these needs praise the name of our Lord we need more in church praise the name of the Lord much are you giving in for the kingdom of God the Bible has told us thine oh Lord is what we are giving you but if he has given you his how much have you given him praise the name of our Lord let us go to Proverbs chapter 3 and then verse 9 Proverbs 3 and then verse so the Bible says honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increas he has blessed you with this he says with your substance praise the name of our Lord honor the Lord with what the Lord has given you then in verse 10 so shall thy Burns be filled with plenty and thy places shall burst out with new wine praise the name of he said he will give and when you learn to give to the Lord he will sustain you in hard times praise the name of he will sustain you he's very faithful when there was famine praise the name of Allah and the Widow gave her food now you look at that time other people we are eating their children other people were eating cow down but this widow woman she had faith in God and she gave to the Lord and the Lord took us through that P praise the name of our but other people we are eating people we don't want to reach such a kind of station praise the name of our we need to learn how to support the kingdom and build the kingdom of God together praise the name of our we need to build it together the shite woman s the need of Elisha she was well off and then she built him a room where would come she saw she she saw the need he travels long distances so then she gave praise the name of our she said no use this praise the name of our Lord we need to be concerned about the work of the Kingdom oh there's this need praise the name of our and then you identify the need stand there praise the name of the Lord give the support we need to build the kingdom together praise the name of our Lord we are building the kingdom of God [Music] praise the name of our Lord and now in the message Christ is identified the same in all generations say we believe in the coming of the Lord that his coming is soon at hand it is at hand now we don't know just what time it will be that he will alive view of this we want to put every effort that we know how to Father the kingdom and get the last person saved into the kingdom and when the last one is saved there will not be one extra when the last one is brought in the body of Christ is complete then the Rapture will come and we are longing for that praise the name of our so what are you doing to make that come to pass because we can't go without the last one let us participate in building the kingdom of God to get the last elect you may not be able to talk to them but are you telling them about our radio programs we have every Tuesday we have every Friday we have every Saturday and then on Sunday are you telling them you may not be to preach them but are you inviting them come for our services you have friends who trust in you tell them about Christ bring them into the fellowship why we are looking for the last St and some places you can't go but then you give the support the one going there praise the name of the Lord going to look for them like they were getting ston from different Mountains from different places praise the name of our Lord and it's still the same thing now we need to see that we get the last one to coming otherwise we can't go in the Rapture without the last person coming praise the name of our Lord we need to participate in building the kingdom praise the name of our Lord now as I finish praise the name of our Lord where we read the Bible says a stone was cut and that stone became a kingdom but then you see Daniel chapter 2 and then verse 30 he says the stone became a great mountain and then in Daniel chapter 2 and then verse 44 he says the kingdom of God which can never end took over all the Earth and now we are part of that Kingdom we are the Lively Stones building up coming to the kingdom we are the Lively stones but there are still other Stones which are outside that we need to bring in now when you look in this scriptures a mountain signifies a kingdom praise the name of the Lord it says I saw the mountain fill the Earth was that a kingdom praise the name of the Lord even in and then that mountain that Kingdom in the millennial of Christ and then we see in Revelation 21 that the New Jerusalem comes down as a mountain praise the name of our Lord it comes down as a mountain praise the name of our Lord let us go and read in Revelations chapter 21 and then verse 10 praise the name of our Lord Revelation CH 21 and then verse 10 it says and he carried me away in a spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the great city the whole Jerusalem descending out from heaven let us jump and go to verse 15 and he that talked with me had a golden R to measure the city and the g thereof and the wall thereof and the city lith for square and the length is as large as the breth and he measure the city with the read 12,000 fongs the length and the breed and the height of it equal now when you look at this 12 in the message the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom then he says in paragraph 367 now notice notice now the Earth is where you turn over to the Book of Revelation you can see how he measured it by the tubit and by the so we find out that the city is measured and then he says 1500 miles now 1500 miles 1500 miles is about 2,000 1500 2,400 km mil so 1500 miles is 1,500 miles 1500 mil and now 1,500 miles is 2 2, 400 km praise the name of our Lord and then when you look at this this distance you can go to Mombasa and back and you have not exhausted it but he's talking about the length of the city and the width of the city and so the length of the city and the width of the city is equal but even the height of the city so in other words the city is going to be 2,400 km high now when you compare with the tallest mountain Everest mountain is only 8.8 km above the sea level 8,000 Miles rather 8 8,848 m but then this one here the peak of Mount Everest ever they can see it 340 km TOA is 80 km then froma to Masa is3 so that's about 210 then from is 130 so now you have about maybe 300 something K from Ginger but this road is Zig but Mount Everest you can be here when it is in and you seeing the top but yet Mount Everest is only 8.8 km above the sea level Kil Kil but then this mountain is 2,000 400 km so you see no wonder the Bible says there will be no son because the lamb who will be on top of that City will be the son of the whole world praise the name of our Lord so now in that message he says in paragraph 368 you know how far that would reach I measured it off this week it would reach from May to Florida and from Eastern SEO to 600 miles apart West of Mississippi so now when you like let us look at what's here if you measure praise the name you know there is two Dimension and three dimension like a two Dimension is like this X and Y length width and when you take that area of 2 * 2,400 you get about 5.7 5.76 million square km 5.7 and that is the size of the East African countries E Africa you bring Kenya Uganda UGA Tanzania Randa South Sudan democra of Cong and Somalia all that big area if you measure in the two Dimension but this city is threedimensional it has this side this side and then up now that is more surface area it increases the surface area and so now in that message paragraph 370 and the bread and the height are the same that would make it 1500 miles this way and then 1500 mil that way and then 1500 miles by the height think of it transparent gold and the city had a wall around it now paragraph 371 then he says there is another geographical measure that the dimensions are the same because on top of the city the lamb was the light then he said that that geographical that kind of geometrical polygon is a pyramid a Four Square in paragraph 449 he says now you have got the city see it is a ho Mountain because Geographic we don't have a pyramid which natur we don't have a natural pyramid it's the pyramids which were made in Egypt by man but the pyramid is a depiction of a mountain so now you see here that the New Jerusalem is a mountain the New Jerusalem is a kingdom praise the name of so now what we are doing now we are building that Kingdom praise the name of the Lord and if you are part of the New Jerusalem you should also participate in the construction of Jerusalem by bringing new members in B let us build the kingdom together praise the name of our Lord let us participate praise the name of our Lord the Bible says John saw the city coming down from heaven as a bride prepared for the husband a city cannot be there without people praise the name of our Lord and we are the people that make that City we are the people that make that Kingdom but as you have got in there's somebody still outside that needs to get in we need to participate together to build the kingdom as I finish now Revelations 21 and vers one he says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth we passed away and there was no Mery and John saw the ho City the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he shall dwell with them and he shall be his people and God himself shall be their God praise the name of our Lord we are building the kingdom together praise the name of our if you are part of that City if you are part of the kingdom of God if you are part of the New Jerusalem your longing is Lord I want to be physically in it so you desire another person who is outside to come and be part of the praise the name of we need to build the kingdom God has been gracious us he has brought us in let us be concerned to bring others in that they can also become the habitation praise the name of our Lord that they can live in the presence of God that God can be dwelling in them as he told them in the Old Testament build me a sanct we are the sanctuary of God we are the Tabernacle of God we are the temple of God we are the kingdom of God we are the New Jerusalem the city of the Living God don't put it to somebody else and say I'm not there you need to be part of it you need to be in it let the Holy Spirit Come and dwell in our lives praise the name of our Lord and when we live where we work where we stud from you know where we we we do everything from
