[3:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus, [singing]
[3:46] now
[3:50] [music]
[3:52] we
[3:54] [singing] are standing [music]
[3:58] in
[4:00] his presence
[4:02] on [music] holy
[4:05] ground.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us h ourselves and pray.
[4:11] Father, how we are thankful, aren't you,
[4:12] Lord Jesus,
[4:14] that you've grown us into a holy ground.
[4:18] A place dedicated, Father,
[4:22] for your services, Lord. [music]
[4:24] And when a place is dedicated,
[4:27] you always [music] honor it, Father. And
[4:30] we believe you are here, Lord Jesus
[4:32] Christ. We pray that, Father, you hear
[4:35] all our prayers.
[4:37] You may accept our worship, Lord.
[4:40] that you may bless our [music] hearts
[4:42] heavenly father
[4:44] and you may again come and speak to us
[4:46] father
[4:48] the things of [music] eternal life.
[4:51] We dedicate ourselves for the service
[4:54] that you [music] may come and have
[4:55] preeminence upon it father
[4:58] that your will and purpose may be done.
[5:02] We lift all the needs of the [music]
[5:03] children of God into your hands.
[5:06] We know everyone their hearts desire. We
[5:09] therefore pray that father you may
[5:10] answer every need
[5:13] and bless us together Lord. Help us
[5:16] together to know in the power of your
[5:17] resurrection
[5:20] seeing that we're living in [music] the
[5:22] day of your coming.
[5:24] Help every one of us father
[5:27] to be ready [music] for the rapture.
[5:30] We love you Lord and we thank you
[5:33] in the name of the Lord Jesus. We pray
[5:34] and ask this.
[5:36] Amen. Let us turn to our Bibles.
[5:41] Praise the name of the Lord. We go to
[5:43] the book of Exodus, chapter 28.
[5:49] We're reading from verse 36.
[5:53] Up to verse 38.
[5:57] The Bible says,
[6:00] &gt;&gt; "And thou shalt make a plate of pure
[6:02] gold and grave upon it like the
[6:06] engravings of a signate holiness to the
[6:09] Lord."
[6:26] And though shall put it on a blues that
[6:30] it may be upon the miter, upon the
[6:33] forefront of the miter, it shall be
[6:53] And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead
[6:56] that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the
[6:59] holy things which the children of Israel
[7:02] shall hallow in all their holy gifts and
[7:06] it shall be always upon his forehead
[7:09] that they may be accepted before the
[7:12] Lord.
[7:37] May God blessing of his word.
[7:39] You may be seated.
[7:42] So I want to preach on the subject
[7:45] holiness to God.
[7:49] Praise the name of our Lord. Holiness to
[7:51] God.
[7:53] like we've just sung that song
[7:56] that we are standing on a holy ground.
[8:00] Praise the name of our Lord. And now you
[8:02] see that Moses
[8:05] when he was raring the the flock of his
[8:08] father-in-law
[8:14] and then he was in on the Mount Sai
[8:19] and then when he you know one thing
[8:21] Moses was doing
[8:24] he would always pass that place
[8:28] going with the sheep all the animals
[8:31] whatever ever heard and then he would
[8:33] pass that place every other day
[8:37] for about 40 years.
[8:39] But then it so happens
[8:42] that one day
[8:44] God comes to the mountain
[8:49] in Exodus 3:1.
[8:53] It says, "Now Moses kept the flock of
[8:54] Jethro, his father-in-law,
[8:57] the priest of Midian, and he led the
[9:00] flock to the backside of the desert and
[9:02] came to the mountain of God, even to
[9:05] Horeb.
[9:22] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[9:24] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[9:27] of the bush. And he looked, and behold,
[9:30] the bush burn with fire, and the bush
[9:33] was not consumed.
[9:48] And Moses said, "I will now turn aside
[9:51] and see this great sight. Why the bush
[9:55] is not burnt?
[10:09] And when the Lord saw that he turned
[10:11] aside to see, God called unto him out of
[10:15] the midst of the bush and said, "Moses,
[10:18] Moses." And he said, "Here am I.
[10:34] And he said, "Grow not nigh hither. Put
[10:38] off thy shoes from off thy feet. For the
[10:41] place where on thou standest is holy
[10:44] ground.
[10:54] Praise the name of our Lord." In other
[10:56] words, the place you are standing in
[11:00] has been dedicated to the Lord.
[11:03] And then he said it is a holy ground.
[11:07] Praise the name of our Lord. And now
[11:09] what made the place holy?
[11:12] Moses would pass there every other day.
[11:16] But then this time when the presence of
[11:18] God comes in a place,
[11:21] it made the place holy.
[11:25] Praise the name of our Lord. So once the
[11:27] presence of God comes down,
[11:30] it makes that place holy.
[11:34] That's why it became a holy ground.
[11:38] Now in the message here you him
[11:41] brother Brandham says
[11:46] he says Peter later called it the holy
[11:50] mount
[11:52] in one of his epistles
[11:55] I do not believe that St. Peter
[11:59] meant it was the it meant it was the m
[12:02] meant that it was the mountain that was
[12:04] holy.
[12:07] It ain't the holy mountain.
[12:13] It is the holy God
[12:17] on the mountain. Praise the name of God.
[12:20] Then he says it isn't a holy church.
[12:28] It is the holy all the holy people.
[12:34] It is the Holy Spirit
[12:37] in the church and in the people that
[12:41] makes them holy.
[12:44] Then he says it isn't the church that is
[12:48] holy
[12:50] nor are the people. It is the Holy
[12:52] Spirit
[12:54] that is in the church and that is what
[12:58] makes it holy.
[13:01] I'm glad of that
[13:03] God is the Holy Spirit
[13:06] and is the the one only that is holy
[13:12] and his presence
[13:14] brings his holy presence among us
[13:18] and changes our nature
[13:21] and makes us want to live
[13:25] like him. Praise the name of the Lord.
[13:28] We are talking about holiness to God.
[13:32] We are talking about holiness to God.
[13:40] Praise the name of the Lord. Now,
[13:41] brother Brandham is telling us. What
[13:44] makes a church holy
[13:47] is the presence of God in the church.
[13:50] What makes a person holy
[13:53] is the presence of God in that person.
[13:56] What made the mountain holy
[13:59] was the presence of God on that
[14:01] mountain?
[14:03] What made the ground Moses was standing
[14:05] on holy
[14:08] was the presence of God on that
[14:11] particular ground.
[14:13] And now we are living in such a time
[14:17] that God desires each and every one of
[14:19] us
[14:21] to be holy. Praise the name of our Lord.
[14:24] That's what the Lord desires every one
[14:26] of us. He wants us to be holy. But you
[14:30] can never be holy on your own.
[14:34] You cannot do anything of your own to BE
[14:38] HOLY. THE ONLY WAY YOU can be holy is by
[14:42] allowing God who is holy
[14:45] to come into your life. AND WHEN GOD
[14:48] THAT IS HOLY, when he comes in your
[14:51] life, he makes you holy.
[14:54] Praise the name of God. And so that's
[14:56] what brother Brandham is saying. When
[14:59] the presence of God comes in us,
[15:02] then it changes our nature
[15:06] because we are born in sin and shaped in
[15:08] iniquity. You had no choice about your
[15:11] first birth,
[15:13] but then you HAVE A CHOICE ABOUT YOUR
[15:15] second birth
[15:17] to be like the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise
[15:20] the name of our Lord. NOW GOD chose
[15:22] Israel.
[15:24] and he called them. I have called you
[15:29] that you can be a holy nation
[15:32] in Exodus chapter 19.
[15:35] And then verse five,
[15:37] &gt;&gt; he says, "Now therefore,
[15:40] if you'll obey my voice indeed and keep
[15:44] my commandments, then you shall be a
[15:47] partial treasure unto me above all the
[15:51] people, for all the earth is mine.
[16:17] And you shall be unto me a kingdom of
[16:20] priests, a holy nation. These are the
[16:23] words which you shall speak unto the
[16:25] children of Israel.
[16:37] So it is God that chose Israel.
[16:41] He said, "I've revealed myself to you. I
[16:44] have separated you from Egypt
[16:47] where you were worshiping idols,
[16:50] where you're doing all kind of
[16:52] abomination.
[16:54] I'm separating you to myself.
[16:58] And as I separate my you to myself,
[17:02] then I'm giving you my commandments.
[17:05] I'm telling you about my covenant.
[17:08] IF YOU'LL OBEY MY voice
[17:12] and you keep my commandments,
[17:15] you keep my covenant.
[17:17] Then you shall be a patient treasure
[17:21] ABOVE ALL [screaming]
[17:22] THE PEOPLE.
[17:25] Praise the name of God. AND WHAT A
[17:27] PRIVILEGE THAT WE HAVE NOW THAT GOD HAS
[17:31] CALLED US OUT OF denomination
[17:34] and he has separated us to himself.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. He has
[17:39] revealed himself to you and the incense
[17:43] why God has called you
[17:46] that you can be his own.
[17:48] Praise the name of THE LORD. THE WAY HE
[17:50] CHOSE ISRAEL
[17:52] and said to make you a puli people
[17:56] to make you a kingdom of priests
[17:59] TO MAKE YOU A HOLY NATION.
[18:01] NOW YOU NOTICE that Israel he gave them
[18:04] the commandment but now for us because
[18:08] for them they were taken into law
[18:12] and God tells them if you will obey my
[18:15] voice.
[18:17] But now we are living in A TIME WHERE
[18:21] THE BIBLE TELLS US IN JOHN CHAPTER ONE
[18:25] and then in verse 12 THAT AS MANY as
[18:29] received him
[18:31] to them he gave them power to become the
[18:34] children of God.
[18:36] And then the Bible says he we have
[18:39] received of him
[18:42] grace for grace,
[18:45] truth for truth. We are living in a time
[18:49] where it is the LORD HIMSELF
[18:52] WORKING out his holiness
[18:55] in our lives. In the Old Testament, IT
[18:59] WAS ABOUT OBEDIENCE.
[19:01] THAT WAS THEIR SEPARATION. BUT NOW IN
[19:04] THE NEW TESTAMENT,
[19:06] SALVATION IS OF the Lord. SO THEN WHAT
[19:09] YOU have to DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL,
[19:12] LORD, I'M HERE. LORD, I accept it to be
[19:14] my personal life. PRAISE THE NAME of our
[19:17] LORD IS YOU ALLOW GOD
[19:20] TO TAKE CHARGE OVER your life. As many
[19:22] as received him then gave you the power.
[19:27] He gave you He gives you the ability
[19:30] to overcome sin. IN THE OLD TESTAMENT,
[19:34] IT WAS THEIR STRUGGLES.
[19:37] IT WAS THEIR WORKS.
[19:40] It was all the TIME A STRUGGLE,
[19:43] A LABOR.
[19:45] But now in the New Testament, IT'S THE
[19:48] GRACE OF GOD THAT CALLS US AND SAY,
[19:51] "COME AND WALK."
[19:54] Praise the name of our Lord. When they
[19:56] looked at the prostitute,
[19:58] when the prostitute was washing the feet
[20:00] of Jesus,
[20:02] said, "This woman is not one."
[20:05] Jesus told her, "Praise the name of the
[20:07] Lord, YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN."
[20:10] WHEN THEY GOT THE WOMAN IN ADULTERY
[20:13] AND BROUGHT HER TO THE TEMPLE AND THEY
[20:15] WANTED TO STONE HER ACCORDING TO THE
[20:18] LAW, Jesus told them, "I DON'T CONDEMN
[20:21] YOU." BUT THEN JESUS TOLD THIS WOMAN,
[20:26] "Walk in the light."
[20:28] And that's what we need to walk in the
[20:30] light if we are going to be holy before
[20:33] the Lord.
[20:34] Praise the name of our Lord. AND THE
[20:36] JOURNEY HE HAS CALLED US to do
[20:39] The journey we are called to walk with
[20:41] you.
[20:43] IT'S NOT OUR ABILITY.
[20:46] IT'S all about our willingness.
[20:51] You desire.
[20:53] Praise the name of the Lord. Just be
[20:55] obedient.
[20:57] Yield yourself
[20:59] and then you see THE MORE OF GOD COMING
[21:01] DOWN IN YOUR LIFE.
[21:04] Praise the name of the Lord. It's not by
[21:06] your power. It's not by your might. BUT
[21:09] BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[21:11] Praise the name of our Lord. SO HE TOLD
[21:13] ISRAEL, "IF YOU'LL OBEY MY VOICE AND
[21:17] KEEP MY COVENANT,
[21:20] you shall be a kingdom of priest
[21:23] and a holy nation."
[21:26] Now we see that when Israel was called
[21:29] as A HOLY NATION,
[21:32] THE BIBLE says to them in Romans chapter
[21:36] 9 verse4,
[21:39] He says, "Who are the Israelites?
[21:41] To whom pertainth the adoption and the
[21:45] glory and the covenants and the giving
[21:48] of the law and the services of God and
[21:51] the promises."
[21:53] Romans 9:4.
[22:15] Praise the name of the Lord. So he says
[22:17] as a holy nation,
[22:21] adoption of God belongs to them.
[22:25] The glory of God BELONGS TO THEM.
[22:28] THE COVENANTS of God belong to them.
[22:31] The law belongs to them. The service of
[22:35] God belongs to them.
[22:37] and the promises of God did not.
[22:40] They were separated.
[22:42] He called them out of Egypt
[22:45] and then he made them his children.
[22:48] And then in Deuteronomy chapter 14
[22:51] and then verse 1 to verse three,
[22:54] the Bible says, "You are the children of
[22:57] the Lord your God. You shall not cut
[23:01] yourselves nor make any baldness between
[23:05] your eyes for the dead.
[23:22] For thou art a holy people unto the Lord
[23:25] thy God, and the Lord has chosen you to
[23:28] be a peculiar people unto himself above
[23:32] all nations that are upon the earth, you
[23:35] shall not eat any abominable thing.
[23:52] Now he called them out and God started
[23:57] expressing himself.
[24:01] He started revealing to them his will.
[24:06] There's a scripture where God was
[24:09] telling Moses,
[24:11] I WILL NOT come in the midst of these
[24:13] people.
[24:15] BECAUSE IF I COME IN THEIR MIDST,
[24:19] I will destroy most of them
[24:22] because they are stiff necked people.
[24:26] They are rebarious.
[24:28] So he said, I'll be away from them.
[24:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, so he
[24:36] was telling the children of Israel
[24:39] how to behave themselves,
[24:42] how to conduct themselves,
[24:45] how to dress, and even what to eat and
[24:49] even what not to eat. He was showing
[24:52] them that I don't want you to defile
[24:55] yourself
[24:56] in any kind of way. I don't want to
[25:00] defile yourself so that you become
[25:03] disliked before me.
[25:08] Praise the name of Lord. So there is a
[25:10] particular walk
[25:12] that THE LORD ALSO WANTS US TO WALK.
[25:16] There is a particular conduct
[25:19] that the Lord wants us to conduct us
[25:23] at your home. There is the way God wants
[25:25] you to do things at your place of work.
[25:28] This is the way God wants you to do
[25:29] things. Anywhere you go, there is a way
[25:33] that is pleasing to him
[25:36] which he desires us
[25:39] to be living in.
[25:42] Praise the name of our Lord. And this is
[25:44] what the word brings out,
[25:47] when you read in the book of Ephesians,
[25:48] for example,
[25:50] when you read in the book of Colossians,
[25:53] they show you different kind of things.
[25:57] AND THEN PAUL was telling them in some
[26:00] of these scriptures if we can pick them
[26:02] up
[26:04] in Ephesians chapter
[26:07] 4 verse 19.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Who being past
[26:13] feeling have given themselves over unto
[26:16] lasciviousness
[26:18] to work all and cleanness with
[26:20] greatness.
[26:36] But you have not learned so of Christ.
[26:42] Now he's saying the world they do
[26:45] everything they want to do.
[26:48] THEY DON'T CARE WHAT they are doing. BUT
[26:50] NOW WHEN WE COME TO CHRIST, there is a
[26:54] particular walk
[26:56] that the Lord desires from us. So he
[26:58] says, "You have not learned of Christ.
[27:03] If so be you've heard him
[27:07] and have been taught by him,
[27:09] as the truth is in Jesus
[27:13] that you put off concerning the former
[27:15] conversation, the old man
[27:23] which is corrupt according to the
[27:25] deceitful lusts.
[27:30] Praise the name of our Lord. I just got
[27:32] the book of first Peter chapter 3.
[27:37] Chapter one
[27:38] and then verse two.
[27:41] The Bible says,
[27:48] "Elect according to the forn knowledge
[27:50] of God the Father through sanctification
[27:54] of the Spirit and to obedience and
[27:57] sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[28:00] Grace unto you and peace be multiplied.
[28:20] Blessed be the God and the Father of our
[28:23] Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
[28:26] his abundant mercy has begotten us again
[28:31] unto a lively hope by the resurrection
[28:34] of Jesus Christ from the dead. Forever.
[28:59] So he says he has begotten us
[29:03] and he has begotten us
[29:05] to a lively hope
[29:10] and to be begotten.
[29:12] We have been born again
[29:15] like we were talking last Sunday. We are
[29:18] not of this world. Our citizenship
[29:22] is in heaven. And if our citizenship is
[29:25] in heaven,
[29:27] then we have been born from heaven.
[29:30] Here I can say we are Ugandans
[29:33] because you were born here.
[29:35] Even when you do a worse crime,
[29:39] they will not take you anywhere other
[29:42] than putting you in the prison. But if
[29:44] you do a worse crime and you're not from
[29:46] this country,
[29:50] they say, "Let us deport him."
[29:53] But you were born here.
[29:55] So now for you to get inheritance
[29:58] is because you were born here. You are
[30:01] recognized as a citizen.
[30:03] So even in heaven, we have to be born in
[30:07] heaven to say we are citizens of heaven.
[30:11] Praise the name of our Lord. AND THAT'S
[30:12] WHAT THE BIBLE IS TELLING US. OUR LORD
[30:16] JESUS CHRIST
[30:18] HAS BOUGHT us
[30:21] to a lively hope.
[30:23] OUR FIRST BIRTH, WE ARE BORN BY OUR
[30:26] fathers and mothers.
[30:28] But our SECOND BIRTH, WE ARE BORN BY the
[30:32] Lord from heaven.
[30:35] We are born by the spirit of God.
[30:39] Now when you are BORN BY THE SPIRIT OF
[30:41] GOD,
[30:42] YOU BECOME HOLY.
[30:45] because the spirit dwells in you.
[30:47] SO THEN THE BIBLE says he HAS WE HAVE
[30:51] BEEN born
[30:53] and when we are BORN WE ARE BORN TO an
[30:56] inheritance
[30:59] which is not corruptible
[31:02] which is not defiled
[31:04] WHICH DOES NOT FADE away
[31:07] which is reserved in heaven
[31:10] first.
[31:14] So we are born to an inheritance
[31:19] which is incorruptible
[31:21] and undeiled
[31:24] and fadeth not away
[31:27] reserved in heaven
[31:30] for you. So we are pilgrims here.
[31:35] We are strangers here. Praise the name
[31:37] of our Lord. BUT WE HAVE BEEN BORN
[31:39] AGAIN.
[31:41] BORN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[31:44] WE ARE A HOLY PEOPLE.
[31:46] THAT'S HOW THE LORD HAS CALLED US TO BE.
[31:49] SO IF YOU ARE A HOLY PERSON,
[31:52] EVEN YOUR WALK SHOULD REFLECT that you
[31:55] are holy.
[31:57] Your dressing should reflect THAT YOU
[31:59] ARE HOLY.
[32:01] YOUR TALKING SHOULD REFLECT THAT YOU ARE
[32:03] HOLY.
[32:05] Praise the name of like when you got
[32:07] some of these people who are lifting
[32:08] electricity poles.
[32:11] I don't know their motivation
[32:15] but they think by saying obscene words
[32:19] doesn't able to lift the p.
[32:23] But you are different from that
[32:26] or when you go to garages some of those
[32:28] places
[32:30] and then maybe a young woman is passing
[32:32] there
[32:33] talk of sin things but you you are
[32:36] different.
[32:38] Praise the name of the Lord. YOU ARE
[32:40] DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD.
[32:43] WHY? You are holy before the Lord.
[32:47] Praise the name of our Lord. So he SAYS
[32:49] HE HAS RESERVED us
[32:51] an inheritance
[32:54] that does not fade away.
[32:56] That is not corruptible.
[32:58] And then now in our walk,
[33:02] the Bible says in verse five,
[33:05] we are KEPT BY THE POWER OF GOD.
[33:10] THROUGH FAITH. Praise the name of God.
[33:13] So when HE CALLS YOU, HE himself
[33:18] gives you the ability to walk before him
[33:22] and be holy.
[33:24] Praise the name of our Lord. That's what
[33:26] the Lord does. He just desires our
[33:29] willingness.
[33:34] When he says
[33:36] come TO CHURCH, IT'S FOR OUR GOODNESS TO
[33:40] COME TO CHURCH.
[33:42] Praise the name of our Lord. When he
[33:44] says we have a midweek service,
[33:47] it's for our good to have a midweek
[33:48] service.
[33:50] Monday, the devil is all the time.
[33:54] Tuesday the devil is so much
[33:58] Wednesday
[33:59] he puts there a fueling station
[34:06] to refresh you to encourage you THE
[34:10] BIBLE SAYS DON'T AVOID assembling
[34:13] together
[34:15] so on Sunday YOU'VE LEFT CHURCH
[34:18] BUT BY THE TIME WEDNESDAY COMES
[34:21] maybe the devil's held you
[34:24] spoiled you.
[34:27] He has spoiled your thoughts.
[34:31] And then when you COME TO CHURCH,
[34:35] YOU COME TO BATHE.
[34:37] You come to be sanctified.
[34:40] Lord, make me clean. Lord, made me holy.
[34:44] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[34:46] helps you in this. He helps you in this.
[34:49] You live on Wednesday evening BETTER
[34:50] THAN YOU.
[34:52] YOU ABLE TO GO THROUGH THURSDAY,
[34:56] SATURDAY, come back again on Sunday. SO
[34:59] WHAT THE DEVIL does is to make you too
[35:02] busy.
[35:04] When I say we come here for only one or
[35:06] two hours,
[35:08] I don't have time for the Lord.
[35:11] We come here for just the morning most
[35:13] times,
[35:15] but he gives you business on Sunday
[35:17] morning.
[35:20] That's the time you want first wash your
[35:21] clothes.
[35:24] That's the time you want to check on the
[35:26] other thing. That's the time you want to
[35:28] catch up with the other thing. By the
[35:31] time you come to church, you are
[35:33] exhausted.
[35:36] At 11 or midday,
[35:40] you're exhausted.
[35:43] How are you going to be sanctified
[35:46] when you're not receiving the elements
[35:49] of sanctification?
[35:52] You know, our sanctification
[35:54] is continuous until we leave the earth
[35:59] because every day we pick up things
[36:00] which are not right.
[36:03] Sometimes an evil imagination,
[36:06] sometimes an evil word you spoke.
[36:08] Sometimes you've done something wrong.
[36:10] Sometimes you know even the things
[36:12] you've refused to do
[36:14] but he puts places
[36:17] to help us in the journey.
[36:20] Praise the name of our Lord. So now he
[36:23] says he keeps us by his power.
[36:27] Praise the name of our Lord. You know in
[36:29] the denomination
[36:31] they say
[36:35] the big powerful man of God has come.
[36:38] The man with power.
[36:42] Now to them they think power
[36:45] is waving the hand
[36:48] and people fall down.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; He's powerful. But now this man they
[36:56] saying is having power.
[36:59] He'll find is the man who is falling at
[37:02] a small temptation.
[37:06] Now where is that power?
[37:08] But the Bible is telling us God keeps us
[37:13] by his power. It's the power of God that
[37:17] has kept us that you are still
[37:19] confessing Christ as your person.
[37:22] It's the power of God that has brought
[37:25] us here this morning.
[37:27] It's the power of God THAT MAKES YOU
[37:30] AVOID bad things.
[37:32] It's the power of God that makes you
[37:35] repent when you do wrong.
[37:37] It's the power of God that keeps you
[37:40] going.
[37:41] It's the power of God. WHEN YOU FALL
[37:44] DOWN, YOU ARE ABLE TO RISE UP. NOT your
[37:47] ability is the power of God. That's what
[37:50] the Bible is TELLING US. AS MANY as
[37:53] received him. He gave them the power
[37:58] to be children of God.
[38:00] something inside of you
[38:04] that draws you into the presence of God.
[38:08] Something inside of you THAT DESIRES.
[38:12] LORD, I WANT TO be in your presence.
[38:14] LORD, I WANT TO BE IN CHURCH THIS
[38:16] MORNING. LORD, I WANT TO READ my
[38:18] message. LORD, I WANT TO PRAY UNTO YOU.
[38:21] IT'S THE POWER OF GOD THAT KEEPS WORKING
[38:24] in your life to bring you into his
[38:27] presence. Praise the name of our Lord.
[38:30] And you know brother Brandham says
[38:32] angelic beings
[38:35] they associate together. SO IF YOU HAVE
[38:37] THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN YOU are bound to
[38:40] bring the angels of God back.
[38:43] Praise the name of our life we want to
[38:46] live
[38:47] by Christ is always welcome in our
[38:50] heart. Christ is always welcome in your
[38:52] heart. Christ is always welcome at your
[38:55] place of
[38:56] praise the name of our Lord. He keeps us
[38:59] by his power.
[39:01] Praise the name of our Lord. So let us
[39:03] go back to Ephesians chapter 4
[39:06] and then verse 23.
[39:09] The Bible says, "And be renewed in the
[39:13] spirit of your mind."
[39:19] So it is the Holy Spirit
[39:23] that renews us. WHEN THE HOLY GHOST
[39:26] COMES IN YOUR LIFE,
[39:28] HE CHANGES YOUR THINKING.
[39:31] HE CHANGES your desires.
[39:33] He changes your passions.
[39:36] He gives you a holy man in thirst.
[39:42] Praise the name of God. LIKE DAVID, HE
[39:45] HAD A HOLY MAN.
[39:48] I was HAPPY WHEN THEY SAID unto me, let
[39:51] us go into THE HOUSE. A HOLY man is s
[39:56] BUT A DRUNKARD is s
[40:04] come to evening time you know in Kenya
[40:06] they have a lawyer don't drink during
[40:08] day time
[40:15] refuses people to drink during day
[40:17] &gt;&gt; and then there was somebody who was
[40:18] proposing it here
[40:21] but no things are not going through.
[40:26] So now like a drunkard,
[40:28] he has a thirst for alcohol.
[40:32] So when he go through catch road there,
[40:34] the upper side,
[40:37] you know, you get many bars one after
[40:39] another
[40:41] one.
[40:43] I think he can say today I'll be here,
[40:46] I'll be there, one will be there. say
[40:49] let me be on maybe
[40:51] I'll be on bell
[40:54] then maybe I'll be on prisoner
[40:57] &gt;&gt; say ah
[41:00] &gt;&gt; because that's what they are given in
[41:04] but when you are born of Christ
[41:07] when you are a new creation
[41:10] you not have those desires
[41:14] praise the name of our lord brother
[41:16] Brandham says in this message.
[41:19] Thirsting for God.
[41:21] Praise the name of our Lord. Let me pick
[41:23] it up. Thirsting for life. He said, "But
[41:28] what makes a man do it in the first
[41:30] place
[41:33] is because when God made a man,
[41:36] he created him. Thus,
[41:40] he made a man to thirst.
[41:44] There is a little place in the heart
[41:52] that nothing will fill it but God.
[41:57] And man is thirsting for something.
[42:01] And that real thirst is for God.
[42:06] And nobody has got a right
[42:09] to try to quench that holy thirst
[42:15] with giving it to the devil for the
[42:18] things of the world.
[42:21] You've got no right
[42:23] trying to hide that thirst by joining
[42:26] church.
[42:36] God is the only thing
[42:39] that will fill that up.
[42:42] The Holy Spirit is the only thing that
[42:45] can satisfy that thirst.
[42:50] Jesus said, "Blessed are they that do
[42:53] hunger
[42:56] and thirst for righteousness."
[43:00] And it is God trying to get the human
[43:02] heart
[43:04] And the devil tries to quench that by
[43:07] letting him drink themselves to death
[43:13] or run themselves to death
[43:16] or do something else. But God created
[43:19] man to have that holy thirst.
[43:25] And if you won't take God,
[43:30] then you'll have to take something else
[43:34] appeasing to that calling.
[43:37] That's what makes man that way.
[43:41] God made him to be a king.
[43:44] And God wants to set your heart to sit
[43:47] on your heart throne.
[43:51] You have, you've got no right to let the
[43:55] devil put the things of his making.
[44:00] You got no right.
[44:02] Let me say this. There's nothing that
[44:05] will satisfy
[44:07] but God. You can do what you want to do.
[44:11] drink yourself to crazy,
[44:15] but you'll never be satisfied
[44:18] until Christ
[44:21] takes his place in your heart.
[44:25] And that's what we are here to do.
[44:27] Christ come and take your place in my
[44:29] heart.
[44:31] Praise the name of the Lord. Fulfilling
[44:33] the thirst.
[44:36] Praise the name OF THE LORD. GOD PUTS A
[44:38] DESIRE IN YOUR heart and then you just
[44:41] long for God.
[44:44] I need more of you, Lord. I need more of
[44:47] you, Lord. And that should be our desire
[44:51] is that every time we come into the
[44:52] presence of God, Lord, I'm in
[44:55] expectations.
[44:57] Every day, God gives us to be alive.
[45:01] Lord, I desire to see your mercies in my
[45:03] life.
[45:04] I desire to see your goodness IN MY
[45:06] LIFE.
[45:08] EVERY DAY THAT YOU LIVE, you just leave
[45:10] it in expectations.
[45:13] Praise the name of Lord and seeking
[45:15] every day to do the things that are
[45:18] pleasing to God. Praise the name of our
[45:21] Lord. AND THAT'S THE DESIRE OF God that
[45:24] he can come down in our LIVES AND TAKE
[45:28] CHARGE OVER our lives
[45:30] because God made the heart of man
[45:34] to be his throne.
[45:37] in the name of God to be enthrone.
[45:41] You know where he can come and
[45:42] positionally sit
[45:45] and he's so happy that he's welcome.
[45:49] And when God is in your heart, you'll
[45:52] not get your fault, go in hiding
[45:56] pornography.
[45:59] You will not do that. What is inside
[46:01] here?
[46:03] doesn't it this that
[46:06] praise the name of our Lord WHEN GOD IS
[46:08] INSIDE of you do not put your earphones
[46:13] and put the phone in your pocket
[46:16] and hear secular music
[46:18] all wicked music is running through your
[46:20] mind
[46:22] DO THAT
[46:24] IS inside of you those things become
[46:27] detestable
[46:30] they are filthy
[46:33] They are wicked.
[46:35] They smell bad.
[46:38] Praise the name of Allah. You know how
[46:40] do you really a normal person,
[46:43] how do you get a good meal
[46:46] and then you go in the toilet and start
[46:47] eating from?
[46:50] There's something wrong.
[46:52] How do you get something sweet and go to
[46:54] the rubbish pits
[46:58] and that's where you want to live?
[47:00] Those are the people living in sin
[47:04] all the time night life
[47:07] and you know they sing for them
[47:12] the life of this world is enjoyable at
[47:15] night then on their in their heart the
[47:19] devil is there
[47:23] let us drink our wine because in heaven
[47:25] there is no wine
[47:26] &gt;&gt; but you can't get there with that
[47:27] mentality
[47:31] you know, they have things they they
[47:33] they kind of appease themselves
[47:38] and then he gets a song, he dances
[47:42] himself into that song,
[47:45] one needs to be born again.
[47:47] Praise the name of our Lord. When Christ
[47:49] come into your heart,
[47:52] he will change your nature.
[47:54] He will change your appetite.
[47:57] If you are the kind of person when you
[48:00] hear somebody has talked against you and
[48:03] you want to go attack them immediately
[48:05] when Christ is there when Christ is in
[48:08] your house it will be different
[48:11] I forgive him
[48:14] praise the name of maybe you are in the
[48:16] neighborhood
[48:19] you know in the neighborhood
[48:24] this one is in this
[48:26] The other one is in the other. And now
[48:28] we've been in Christmas.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Everybody was wondering
[48:36] what is this one going to eat?
[48:40] His husband uh her husband bought her a
[48:43] dress. Now if you're Christian in those
[48:46] places,
[48:48] what are you going to do when everything
[48:50] has not been good?
[48:53] Are you going to complain?
[48:59] &gt;&gt; And sometimes God permits to be in those
[49:01] places
[49:04] to check your character.
[49:06] Praise the name of our Lord. He allows
[49:09] you to be criticized
[49:13] to find out how are you going to react.
[49:17] Praise the name of our Lord. But when
[49:19] God is in your heart,
[49:22] he takes charge over all those
[49:24] strations.
[49:26] Now in the message, the unity of one God
[49:28] in the one church,
[49:33] it says, you see that little that little
[49:37] part
[49:39] compartment in a man's heart,
[49:44] God made that in there for himself.
[49:50] That is his control room.
[49:54] He sits there to control you. Praise the
[49:58] name of our Lord. That's the desire of
[50:00] God. I want to be inside of your heart.
[50:06] Praise the name of the Lord. So if you
[50:08] find that God is not in your heart,
[50:11] will you accept him today?
[50:14] Lord, I invite you to come in my heart.
[50:18] You created that part in me.
[50:22] You created that part in me
[50:25] for yourself. I'm rejecting Satan. I'm
[50:29] rejecting the things of the world. I'm
[50:32] rejecting all evil.
[50:34] I'm inviting you to come in.
[50:37] Praise the name of our Lord. That's what
[50:39] the Lord wants us.
[50:41] So Denise says that is his control room.
[50:45] He sets there.
[50:47] to control you.
[50:50] Praise the name of the Lord. So you find
[50:53] your thoughts
[50:55] just like David said when we read in
[50:58] Psalms 19.
[51:01] Praise the name of our Lord. Psalms 19.
[51:04] I just want to pick it up
[51:07] and then
[51:10] verse let me get the verse.
[51:14] Psalms 19 and verse 14.
[51:17] He says, "Let the words of my mouth
[51:22] and the meditation of my heart
[51:25] be acceptable in your sight.
[51:29] Oh Lord, my strength
[51:33] and my redeemer."
[51:35] So when God has taken charge over your
[51:38] heart,
[51:40] your thoughts are right before God.
[51:43] Your words are right BEFORE GOD.
[51:46] SO HE wants to be a control tower.
[51:51] He wants to control.
[51:54] That is his control room.
[51:56] He sets there to control you.
[52:00] That is his place.
[52:02] That's where he sends his messages from
[52:07] to the control room.
[52:10] How can he work with you
[52:13] when the nature of the spirit of the
[52:15] devil is in there?
[52:19] And every man born on earth
[52:23] is born in sin shaped in iniquity come
[52:27] to the world speaking lies
[52:30] that is right. So in thatademic nature
[52:38] of how can a man achieve anything
[52:44] only by through his intellectuals.
[52:52] But when he comes to be a new creature
[52:56] and the old man has passed out
[53:01] and the new man, Christ takes his throne
[53:07] in the human heart,
[53:10] then life
[53:12] looks different.
[53:14] Then he starts on a new road
[53:18] from his own selfish motive
[53:22] till the big ideas
[53:25] to make himself something big.
[53:29] He starts right towards Calvary
[53:34] recognize God. Then his
[53:38] all his objective,
[53:41] all his motive,
[53:43] his achievement
[53:45] and all that he is,
[53:47] he lays in the glory of the cross
[53:52] where Christ paid the price for human
[53:55] life.
[53:58] Praise the name of our Lord. And he says
[54:01] Christ is our life. Praise the name of
[54:04] our Lord. That's holiness.
[54:07] Praise the name of our Lord WHERE CHRIST
[54:09] HIMSELF HAS TAKEN charge over your life.
[54:14] No longer I that liveth but the Christ
[54:17] that liveth.
[54:19] And that should always be our desire.
[54:22] THE DAY YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING,
[54:24] LORD, I COMMIT MY DAY into your heart.
[54:27] Lord, I commit my work into your heart.
[54:29] Lord, I commit my family into your
[54:30] heart. Lord, I commit my friends into
[54:33] your heart.
[54:34] WE WANT GOD TO TAKE CHARGE over
[54:36] everything.
[54:38] Praise the name of our in the message
[54:40] the queen of the south.
[54:46] He says when God made a human heart,
[54:50] he made a little place in there for
[54:53] himself.
[54:56] He made you so you would thirst.
[55:00] Not thirst for that.
[55:04] but thirst for him.
[55:07] How dare a man or a woman
[55:11] or a citizen of any country
[55:14] to try to thirst to quench that holy
[55:17] thirst with the things of the world.
[55:21] That's the reason they do it
[55:25] because you don't need another drink.
[55:30] You don't need an cigarette.
[55:33] You smokers,
[55:35] you don't need another drink.
[55:38] You people who drink, you don't need
[55:41] another party.
[55:43] You need what you need is God
[55:47] to thirst for that righteousness.
[55:50] God made that place made you to thirst.
[55:55] That is part of you. He made that little
[55:58] place in your heart.
[56:01] to thrown himself
[56:04] and to satisfy your thirst.
[56:08] Praise the name of the Lord. That's what
[56:10] the Lord was telling Israel.
[56:13] Praise the name of the Lord. You know,
[56:15] accept my word.
[56:18] God told Abraham,
[56:20] "Walk before me and then be perfect."
[56:24] Praise the name of our Lord. So,
[56:26] holiness to God.
[56:29] It is God's own holiness,
[56:34] not our holiness.
[56:37] But we have to allow him
[56:40] to come in our lives and then he gives
[56:43] us his holiness.
[56:45] Praise the name of our Lord in the
[56:47] message Israel and the church.
[56:49] He says
[56:51] &gt;&gt; now I will.
[56:55] When God says he will do anything,
[56:59] you can look for it to be done.
[57:03] When man says he will do anything,
[57:06] I don't know how about that.
[57:09] BUT GOD told Abraham,
[57:12] I will save you and your seed after you.
[57:17] Not only Abraham
[57:19] but all Abraham's seed
[57:22] unconditionally se
[57:26] if you'll excuse me.
[57:29] Then he says
[57:34] maybe some of you have never thought
[57:36] deep enough to get into it.
[57:40] God has always glorified his church.
[57:44] Those who justify
[57:47] He has also glorified in the church in
[57:50] Christ. If you are sanctified in Christ,
[57:54] you are glorified in Christ already as
[57:57] far as God is already concerned.
[58:00] Jesus said, be therefore perfect.
[58:05] Even as your father in heaven is
[58:07] perfect,
[58:09] how can you ever be perfect?
[58:13] But in the sight of Christ tonight,
[58:18] Every born again Christian
[58:22] is perfect.
[58:24] I'm just as perfect in God
[58:28] as Christ was.
[58:31] You are too.
[58:34] Every other believer.
[58:36] So it's not my holiness.
[58:40] It is his holiness.
[58:42] God cannot accept mine.
[58:46] I have none.
[58:48] But I come in Christ by faith
[58:52] and by Christ I'm in him and perfect in
[58:57] the sight of God. So what holiness is
[59:00] God desiring of us.
[59:03] God desires his own holiness.
[59:07] How do you have his holiness?
[59:10] Allow him to come into your heart.
[59:13] Allow him to govern your thinking.
[59:16] Allow him to govern your talking.
[59:19] Allow him to govern your conduct.
[59:22] And as you allow him, you will display
[59:26] the holiness of God.
[59:29] The way he told Aaron, put on your
[59:32] forehead
[59:34] and engrave on it. Holiness to the Lord.
[59:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Now it is
[59:40] just not an outside thing
[59:44] but it's something from inside.
[59:48] Praise the name of our holiness of God
[59:51] working from the inside of us AND THEN
[59:54] BEING MANIFESTED OUTSIDE.
[59:57] Praise the name of our Lord. THAT'S WHAT
[59:59] THE LORD DESIRES OF US. Every day you
[1:00:02] live
[1:00:05] as holiness
[1:00:07] to the Lord. When the high priest would
[1:00:10] walk in the TEMPLE AND THE BELLS were
[1:00:13] ringing,
[1:00:15] everything
[1:00:17] had to be acceptable before them.
[1:00:20] His garment was holy.
[1:00:22] Praise the NAME OF GOD. EVERYTHING ABOUT
[1:00:25] HIM WAS ACCEPTABLE
[1:00:27] AND THAT WOULD BE a walk of a true
[1:00:28] Christian.
[1:00:30] Your talk is acceptable before the Lord.
[1:00:34] Your talking is accept before the LORD
[1:00:36] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:00:38] YOUR CONVERSATION,
[1:00:40] praise the name of the Lord, is actually
[1:00:42] before THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:00:44] YOUR conduct is actually before the Lord
[1:00:47] Jesus Christ. How can it be acceptable
[1:00:51] when he's not inside,
[1:00:54] you will be actually an imitator,
[1:00:58] BUT ALLOW CHRIST TO COME ON the inside
[1:01:02] and live his own life.
[1:01:05] Praise the name of our Lord. SO WHEN HE
[1:01:07] SAYS HOLY, HOLY,
[1:01:10] praise the name of like when Isaiah had
[1:01:13] that vision
[1:01:15] in Isaiah chapter 6,
[1:01:17] he was shielded by.
[1:01:22] But now when he had a vision,
[1:01:25] a personal revelation
[1:01:28] and he saw in the presence of God in
[1:01:31] front of him flying holy, holy, holy.
[1:01:36] And the BIBLE SAYS WITH TWO WINGS they
[1:01:38] covered their face
[1:01:42] with two wings. They were flying
[1:01:44] with two wings. They were covering their
[1:01:46] face.
[1:01:48] Praise the name of our Lord. And they
[1:01:49] were proclaiming
[1:01:52] You are holy. Lord, you are holy. And
[1:01:55] God accept their confession
[1:01:59] because they were also holy.
[1:02:01] Praise the name of OUR LORD. THEY
[1:02:03] RECOGNIZED God
[1:02:06] and they gave him reverence
[1:02:12] by covering their face.
[1:02:15] THEY WERE HUMBLE BEFORE him
[1:02:19] by covering their feet and then they
[1:02:22] were serving him
[1:02:24] by swinging their wings.
[1:02:26] Let night and night that should be our
[1:02:30] walk
[1:02:32] every day. The Bible says do not be
[1:02:35] wearing good doing
[1:02:38] at your place of work. Do not be wearing
[1:02:40] welloing.
[1:02:42] at your home. Don't be tired of doing
[1:02:45] well.
[1:02:46] Why? God desires a pleasant walk,
[1:02:52] a holy life,
[1:02:54] a life that is yielded to him, a life
[1:02:57] that is consecrated to him.
[1:03:00] Praise the name of our Lord. SO WHEN
[1:03:02] ISAIAH SAW THAT VISION,
[1:03:05] he came back to himself
[1:03:08] said my lips
[1:03:10] at that
[1:03:18] you are a pressari.
[1:03:24] when this one happen is
[1:03:27] there is today should I tell you
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; said ah I'm a man of that
[1:03:34] and then the angel the saraphim
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; you know god wants us to confess
[1:03:41] Lord this is my weakness come and clean
[1:03:45] me praise the name of our lord then the
[1:03:47] seraphim came and washed him
[1:03:50] and when he heard the voice he was
[1:03:53] confident and SAID, "LORD, HERE I AM.
[1:03:57] Send me." Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:04:00] That the word of the Lord will come out
[1:04:02] of him.
[1:04:05] Praise the name of our Lord. So God has
[1:04:07] chosen us
[1:04:09] also to be a holy people.
[1:04:13] Praise the name of our Lord. He has
[1:04:15] chosen us to be his own. And then the
[1:04:19] Bible says in 1 Corinthians
[1:04:23] chapter 3:E1 16
[1:04:27] the scripture says
[1:04:29] know ye not that you are the temple of
[1:04:31] God and the spirit of God dwells in you.
[1:04:35] If any man defile the temple of God him
[1:04:39] shall God destroy. For the temple of God
[1:04:42] is holy which temple you are.
[1:05:03] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[1:05:05] Bible says,
[1:05:07] right now
[1:05:09] if we have the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:11] Spirit,
[1:05:13] we are the temple of God.
[1:05:16] Let us match this with 1 Corinthians
[1:05:19] chapter 6.
[1:05:22] And then verse 19,
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; he says, "What know ye not that you are
[1:05:28] the body that your body is the temple of
[1:05:31] the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which
[1:05:34] you have of God, and you are not your
[1:05:37] own, for you are bought with a price.
[1:05:40] Therefore glorify God in your body and
[1:05:44] in your spirit which our God is.
[1:06:07] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:06:09] So he says
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; we are the temple of God
[1:06:17] and the spirit of God
[1:06:20] dwells in us
[1:06:22] and the temple of God
[1:06:26] is holy.
[1:06:28] So you are the dwelling place of God.
[1:06:31] God has called every one of us
[1:06:35] to be holy. BUT HOW CAN I be holy? Not
[1:06:39] on my own, but allowing the spirit of
[1:06:43] God
[1:06:44] TO COME AND TAKE CHARGE OVER ME.
[1:06:48] Then I become holy.
[1:06:50] Praise the name of the Lord. That's the
[1:06:52] desire of God
[1:06:55] that we can be his dwelling place.
[1:06:58] You can be the temple of God.
[1:07:01] When they had in the tabernacle in the
[1:07:03] Old Testament,
[1:07:05] they had the three apartments.
[1:07:08] There was the outer court, the middle
[1:07:11] court, and then the most in.
[1:07:16] And then the Bible says that there was
[1:07:18] the holy place.
[1:07:20] And the holy place was the middle place.
[1:07:24] But then there WAS THE MOST HOLY PLACE.
[1:07:28] And now in THE MOST HOLY PLACE,
[1:07:31] THAT'S WHERE THEY HAD THE ark of the
[1:07:33] covenant.
[1:07:35] That's where they had the master seat.
[1:07:38] And that's where God told Moses from
[1:07:41] within,
[1:07:42] I will come and commune with you.
[1:07:47] Praise the name of our Lord. That's
[1:07:48] where there was the shakina glory.
[1:07:52] And now we see that ON THE DAY OF
[1:07:53] PENTECOST,
[1:07:55] THAT SAME shakina glory
[1:07:58] came down. Praise the name of the Lord
[1:08:01] as the pillar of fire and it filled the
[1:08:04] place where they were in.
[1:08:07] And then it filled every one of them.
[1:08:10] He filled each of their hearts.
[1:08:13] So the heart of man filled with the Holy
[1:08:16] Spirit becomes the most holy place.
[1:08:21] Praise the name of our Lord. And so when
[1:08:23] he's in the MOST HOLY PLACE,
[1:08:26] THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN HE, THE SPIRIT OF
[1:08:28] TRUTH IS COME,
[1:08:30] HE WILL guide you.
[1:08:34] That's what the Bible says. SO NOW WHEN
[1:08:36] GOD IS IN YOUR HEART, it is ceases to be
[1:08:40] your thinking.
[1:08:43] You get the mind of God.
[1:08:46] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:08:49] your thoughts
[1:08:51] are the thoughts of God. Praise the name
[1:08:54] of our Lord. So the spirit
[1:08:57] reminds you,
[1:08:59] the spirit
[1:09:01] guides you, the spirit teaches you.
[1:09:06] Praise the name of the Lord. These are
[1:09:08] not hard things. Now
[1:09:11] it's just to yield YOURSELF AND SAY,
[1:09:14] "LORD, COME DOWN IN MY HEART. COME AND
[1:09:17] TAKE CHARGE over my life
[1:09:19] so that he can lead your your walk. He
[1:09:23] can guide your speech.
[1:09:26] Christ himself
[1:09:27] living in us. Christ himself the hope of
[1:09:31] glory. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:09:34] need to desire more of God. Lord, I need
[1:09:37] more of you in my life. Praise the name
[1:09:39] of the Lord. You know, God was asking
[1:09:41] the children OF ISRAEL,
[1:09:43] WHAT HAVE I DONE to you that you don't
[1:09:46] like me?
[1:09:48] Praise the name of the Lord. But when
[1:09:49] you come IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD, YOU
[1:09:52] COME, LORD, I NEED MORE of you in my
[1:09:53] life.
[1:09:55] Let him fill you. Let him refill you.
[1:10:00] Let him satisfy you. Praise the name of
[1:10:03] our Lord that he can take charge over
[1:10:05] your life.
[1:10:06] So he says we are the temple of God.
[1:10:10] So the Bible says that even our body,
[1:10:15] let the body glorify the Lord.
[1:10:19] HOW WILL MY BODY GLORIFY THE LORD? BY
[1:10:22] taking my body to the right place.
[1:10:25] Praise the name of the Lord. I will NOT
[1:10:27] TAKE MY BODY TO A PLACE WHICH is wrong.
[1:10:31] Praise the name of the Lord. I'LL NOT
[1:10:32] TAKE MY BODY TO THE DISCO.
[1:10:35] I take my body, you know, to places
[1:10:37] which are filthy.
[1:10:40] I'll not take my body to gambling
[1:10:41] places.
[1:10:43] I'll take my body right places.
[1:10:46] I will dress my body right.
[1:10:49] I WILL NOT DRESS MY BODY FOR MEN to last
[1:10:52] after me. But to SHOW HOW MY FIGURE IS,
[1:10:56] I'm not going to dress my body like
[1:10:57] that. You want your body to glorify God.
[1:11:02] When they look at you, praise the name
[1:11:05] of the Lord. You are decently dressed
[1:11:09] and men will give you respect.
[1:11:12] Praise the name of our Lord. not lusting
[1:11:14] after you to use you and dump you but to
[1:11:18] give you respect. Oh mama mama,
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:11:24] you respect your body.
[1:11:27] I will GIVE I WILL GLORIFY MY BODY.
[1:11:31] Let my body glorify God
[1:11:34] by the words that come out of my mouth.
[1:11:37] By the words that come out of my mouth.
[1:11:40] I'm not going to curse. I'm not going to
[1:11:42] be abusive. I'm not going to shout at
[1:11:45] one another.
[1:11:46] My body is glorifying the Lord. Praise
[1:11:50] the name of our Lord. That's the walk
[1:11:52] the Lord wants us to do.
[1:11:54] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[1:11:56] know the Bible says don't be equally
[1:11:59] joined.
[1:12:04] Let us go to 2 Corinthians chapter 7.
[1:12:11] Rather 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and then
[1:12:13] verse 14
[1:12:16] the Bible says
[1:12:19] be not unequally yolked together with
[1:12:23] unbelievers.
[1:12:28] Now when you get yolked with unbelievers
[1:12:33] they will influence you
[1:12:36] into doing things which are not right.
[1:12:39] So they defile you.
[1:12:42] They make you kind of you know unholy.
[1:12:47] You are going to think the way they are
[1:12:49] doing.
[1:12:51] You are going to behave the way they are
[1:12:52] behaving.
[1:12:54] But he's calling us to a separated walk.
[1:12:59] Then he says what fellowship has
[1:13:02] righteousness with unrighteousness?
[1:13:11] What communion has light with darkness?
[1:13:19] What conquered has Christ with burial?
[1:13:26] Or what part has he that believeth with
[1:13:28] an infidel?
[1:13:33] And what agreement has the temple of God
[1:13:36] with idols?
[1:13:41] You are the temple of the living God.
[1:13:46] As God has said,
[1:13:49] I will dwell in them and walk in them. I
[1:13:53] will be their God.
[1:13:56] You shall be my people.
[1:13:59] Wherefore come out from among them,
[1:14:04] and be ye separate, says God, and touch
[1:14:08] not the unclean thing,
[1:14:11] and I will receive you, and I'll be unto
[1:14:14] you a father.
[1:14:17] You shall be my sons and daughters,
[1:14:22] says the almighty God. Praise the name
[1:14:25] of our Lord. a separate life.
[1:14:28] In Nazarite life,
[1:14:31] you know, a Nazarite life, one had to
[1:14:34] separate themselves.
[1:14:36] And when you receive the baptism of the
[1:14:38] Holy Spirit,
[1:14:40] you become a Nazarite to God.
[1:14:44] Praise the name of our Lord. You are
[1:14:46] separated.
[1:14:47] Your walk is different. Your talk is
[1:14:50] different. Your conduct is different.
[1:14:53] Your thinking is different.
[1:14:56] When somebody thinking about somebody
[1:14:58] who doesn't know,
[1:15:02] they think to exploit that person.
[1:15:10] But now for you, when you know somebody
[1:15:12] is ignorant,
[1:15:16] you're not going to exploit them,
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; but you're going to help them.
[1:15:22] Praise the name of our Lord because you
[1:15:24] are different.
[1:15:26] You are not looking for advantage
[1:15:29] but you ARE LOOKING THAT GOD may be
[1:15:32] glorified.
[1:15:35] You know the Bible says let your light
[1:15:38] so shine
[1:15:40] before all men that when they see your
[1:15:43] good works,
[1:15:45] you glorify the Father which is in
[1:15:46] heaven. And that should be your walk
[1:15:50] desire.
[1:15:52] Lord, I want to live that kind of life.
[1:15:56] Praise the name of our Lord. A life that
[1:15:59] will bring glory to the Lord.
[1:16:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[1:16:05] Jeremiah 2:3,
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; "Israel was holiness unto the Lord, and
[1:16:15] the first fruit of his increase. All
[1:16:18] that devour him shall offend. Evil shall
[1:16:21] come upon him, says the Lord."
[1:16:25] Verse Jeremiah 2:3.
[1:16:55] Praise the name of the Lord. He says,
[1:16:57] "Israel
[1:16:59] was holiness to the Lord.
[1:17:03] Now we are the holiness
[1:17:06] unto the Lord." Praise the name of the
[1:17:09] Lord. So if you are holy to the Lord,
[1:17:13] praise the name of the Lord. You allow
[1:17:15] the Holy Spirit
[1:17:18] to have charge over your life. Praise
[1:17:20] the name of the Lord to guide you, to
[1:17:23] direct you. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:17:27] That's what you are about
[1:17:29] because you are dedicated yourself.
[1:17:33] You are the temple. You are the
[1:17:36] habitation.
[1:17:37] God is seated on the heart.
[1:17:40] The throne of God is now in your heart.
[1:17:44] So your desire,
[1:17:46] what's the mind of God? What is the will
[1:17:49] of God? What can I do for the Lord?
[1:17:53] Praise the name of our should be our
[1:17:55] desire every day. Lord, you have given
[1:17:57] me this new day.
[1:17:59] I want to live the life of Jesus.
[1:18:02] Like the way the Lord has given us this
[1:18:04] new year,
[1:18:06] another year. Praise the name of our
[1:18:08] Lord, another opportunity.
[1:18:11] If there are things I failed
[1:18:14] last year, I pray Lord, give me grace
[1:18:19] that I may be acceptable before.
[1:18:22] that I may do everything that would be
[1:18:24] pleasing.
[1:18:26] A walk that is accepted.
[1:18:29] And the Bible says Enoch walked with God
[1:18:33] and Enoch pleased God and God took him
[1:18:38] and Enoch is the seventh from Adam.
[1:18:43] We are the seventh church age.
[1:18:47] We are in the church age, the lician
[1:18:50] church age of which the overcomers
[1:18:55] out of this year, they are also taken up
[1:18:58] in the rapture.
[1:19:01] Praise the name of our Lord. That's the
[1:19:02] promise that we have. I don't know when
[1:19:05] he's coming. The rapture may be today.
[1:19:08] But the question is, are you ready? Or
[1:19:12] you're saying, Lord, first wait.
[1:19:15] I have some errands to do.
[1:19:20] I want finish some projects.
[1:19:23] I want to do that kind of business.
[1:19:27] You know, there are some things you just
[1:19:28] think about before the Lord.
[1:19:34] But you say, "Lord, first I finish that.
[1:19:37] I want to finish that deal.
[1:19:40] I want to finish that project.
[1:19:43] I I want to marry a very beautiful woman
[1:19:45] before you come.
[1:19:48] Try to look around.
[1:19:51] She's not here. Oh, she's the other
[1:19:53] side.
[1:19:55] What will I do?
[1:19:59] So for you that delays the coming of the
[1:20:01] Lord,
[1:20:03] come first.
[1:20:06] Wait, Lord.
[1:20:08] That should not be so. But when John was
[1:20:11] told, "Behold, I come." John said,
[1:20:16] "Amen." Amen. Even so, come Lord Jesus.
[1:20:20] Praise the name of God. That's the life
[1:20:22] we should live. A life of readiness.
[1:20:27] If he comes this evening, I'll go with
[1:20:29] him. HE COMES IN THE MORNING, I'LL GO
[1:20:32] WITH HIM. If he comes IN THE AFTERNOON,
[1:20:35] I'LL GO WITH HIM. If he comes when I'm
[1:20:37] sleeping, I'll be taken.
[1:20:41] That's what the Bible says. Two will be
[1:20:43] in bed, one will be taken.
[1:20:46] Two will be at a milling maybe place
[1:20:50] preparing lunch.
[1:20:52] One will be taken. Two will be in the
[1:20:54] field. One will be taken. I want to be
[1:20:57] that one. I want to be ready. Praise the
[1:21:01] name of the Lord. Ready every time.
[1:21:05] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:21:06] they see the world in it confusion.
[1:21:10] Praise the name of our Lord. They are
[1:21:12] just to talk about the current affairs.
[1:21:16] I think it was yesterday
[1:21:19] morning, the USA.
[1:21:22] They went and grabbed the president of
[1:21:25] Venezuela,
[1:21:28] got him in the night.
[1:21:33] He is now in USA.
[1:21:36] Now this is the world we are living in.
[1:21:39] and certain it everywhere.
[1:21:42] So you can't expect
[1:21:45] the world to bring peace.
[1:21:49] It's not there. And we see these things
[1:21:52] happening. We may say because they just
[1:21:54] want this because they want this. But
[1:21:57] these things as we get to the coming of
[1:22:00] the Lord,
[1:22:02] the world will become a worse place to
[1:22:04] live in
[1:22:07] worse.
[1:22:08] The situation itself
[1:22:11] when they they do something wrong,
[1:22:15] the other copies and words do the same
[1:22:16] thing or even worse than that.
[1:22:20] No more trust,
[1:22:22] no more anything. So we see we are
[1:22:25] living in a time I know brother Brham
[1:22:27] was teaching us that each of these ages
[1:22:32] there was an overlap.
[1:22:35] So you find that these go into another
[1:22:38] age
[1:22:40] and even the other age picks from this
[1:22:42] other age before
[1:22:45] stretches.
[1:22:47] Praise the name of our Lord. And we are
[1:22:49] living in a time where we see the
[1:22:52] suffering in the world.
[1:22:56] See all these developed countries,
[1:22:58] they don't want refugees in their
[1:23:00] countries.
[1:23:02] When this one says this, other says,
[1:23:04] another say, another say
[1:23:07] the whole world is coming a place
[1:23:11] that we just need to look for the coming
[1:23:13] of the Lord.
[1:23:15] So we need to be ready.
[1:23:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Don't wait
[1:23:19] for the time of the squeeze
[1:23:23] when maybe they say the church is closed
[1:23:26] because it doesn't belong to the
[1:23:28] religious council
[1:23:31] and then you start saying
[1:23:38] praise the name of know where you are
[1:23:40] right now before those times come and as
[1:23:45] long as the church is open
[1:23:47] why don't you be part of to the
[1:23:49] fellowship,
[1:23:50] participate in them. And as you keep on
[1:23:53] participating,
[1:23:55] the Lord keeps on revealing himself,
[1:23:58] encouraging you, strengthening you.
[1:24:01] Praise the name of our Lord. I just want
[1:24:03] to finish.
[1:24:05] Now in Luke 1:74
[1:24:11] the Bible says that he would grant unto
[1:24:15] us that we being delivered out of the
[1:24:18] hand of our enemies might serve him
[1:24:21] without fear. Amen. Luke 174
[1:24:44] Now he says, "God delivered us out of
[1:24:48] our enemies
[1:24:50] that we might serve him without fear
[1:24:56] in holiness
[1:24:59] and righteousness
[1:25:01] before him all the days of our life.
[1:25:05] So God deliver us from the powers of
[1:25:07] darkness
[1:25:10] that before him we can live in holiness.
[1:25:14] Praise the name of our Lord. Don't be
[1:25:16] afraid
[1:25:18] like we on Wednesday here
[1:25:21] talking about continued my temptation
[1:25:25] and then you know God can allow
[1:25:28] temptations to come
[1:25:31] to prove your confession.
[1:25:34] Yeah, he allows it to come. Are you
[1:25:37] going to stand with me
[1:25:40] or you're going to forsake me? He allows
[1:25:43] it to come and Peter that situation came
[1:25:48] and he denied him
[1:25:51] what we looked on last Sunday.
[1:25:53] But when Peter was converted,
[1:25:57] he wouldn't deny Christ.
[1:26:00] Christ was inside of him. And that
[1:26:02] should be our desire.
[1:26:04] Make sure he's inside.
[1:26:08] Make sure God himself is inside of you.
[1:26:12] And when God is inside of you, he will
[1:26:15] change the way you think.
[1:26:18] He will change the way you talk. He will
[1:26:21] change the way YOU CONDUCT.
[1:26:23] YOU'LL HAVE a walk,
[1:26:26] a walk of holiness, a walk of
[1:26:28] righteousness,
[1:26:30] not by yourself, but Christ that dwells
[1:26:33] in us.
[1:26:35] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in 1
[1:26:38] Thessalonians 4:1
[1:26:42] the Bible says,
[1:26:45] "Furthermore, we beseech you, brethren,
[1:26:47] and exalt you by the Lord Jesus that as
[1:26:52] you have received of us how you ought to
[1:26:56] walk and to please God, so you would
[1:26:59] abound more and more."
[1:27:06] Verse one.
[1:27:42] For you know what commandments we gave
[1:27:46] you by the Lord Jesus.
[1:27:54] For this is the will of God, even your
[1:27:57] sanctification, that should abstain from
[1:28:00] fornication.
[1:28:09] That every one of you should know how to
[1:28:11] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[1:28:14] honor.
[1:28:17] Verse
[1:28:23] seven,
[1:28:25] God has not called us unto uncleaness.
[1:28:35] But unto holiness.
[1:28:38] Praise the name of our Lord. That's the
[1:28:40] walk God wants us to live.
[1:28:43] a holy walk,
[1:28:46] sanctified before him,
[1:28:49] acceptable before him. Praise the name
[1:28:52] of our Lord. Every day that you live at
[1:28:55] your place of work, at your home, with
[1:28:58] your friends, with your family,
[1:29:01] everywhere,
[1:29:03] let it be holiness
[1:29:05] unto God. Praise the name of your life,
[1:29:09] let it be holiness to God. Your talk,
[1:29:13] let it be holiness to God. Your work,
[1:29:16] let it be holiness to God. Everything we
[1:29:19] do, may God be pleased with what
[1:29:23] praise the name of God in the message
[1:29:25] why Christ speak.
[1:29:28] Then he says,
[1:29:35] one thing that the tabernacle needs up
[1:29:38] there at our church,
[1:29:45] at the tabernacle at Jefferson
[1:29:49] is a rededication
[1:29:52] and a refilling
[1:29:54] of the Holy Ghost. That's right.
[1:29:58] Everyone to get down to the altar
[1:30:02] and pray until they get a renewing
[1:30:08] of the Holy Ghost. the whole church to
[1:30:12] be filled with the power of God.
[1:30:15] That's what we need. Not only the
[1:30:18] tabernacle there, but the body of Christ
[1:30:23] universal
[1:30:26] it needs a refilling.
[1:30:30] If David said one day,
[1:30:33] restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[1:30:38] Now he had not lost his salvation
[1:30:42] but the joy of it and when it comes to a
[1:30:45] place
[1:30:47] that I cannot enjoy my religion
[1:30:51] my salvation
[1:30:53] there is something wrong somewhere
[1:30:56] because it is joy unspeakable
[1:31:00] and full of glory.
[1:31:04] One of them said, "Test
[1:31:09] and see the Lord is good.
[1:31:12] It tastes like honey in the rock."
[1:31:18] I'm so glad that I have tested that.
[1:31:22] The Lord is good.
[1:31:25] I love honey. But I never tested
[1:31:28] anything like that.
[1:31:30] The best that I know.
[1:31:33] Praise the name of our Lord. We just
[1:31:35] need to rededicate ourselves.
[1:31:39] Praise the name of our Lord. If you have
[1:31:40] been filled with the HOLY SPIRIT, SAY,
[1:31:43] "LORD, fill me again."
[1:31:46] If you have never been filled with the
[1:31:47] Holy Ghost, say, "Lord, I need your Holy
[1:31:50] Spirit
[1:31:51] so that we can live a life of holiness
[1:31:55] in the year that the Lord has given us."
[1:31:58] Praise the name of Lord. You need a
[1:32:00] rededication
[1:32:02] each and every one of us. You need a
[1:32:05] restoration.
[1:32:07] David said, "Restore unto me the joy
[1:32:11] of that salvation." Praise the name of
[1:32:13] our Lord honestly yourself
[1:32:17] desiring within you.
[1:32:20] Praise the name of God. Look at how much
[1:32:22] time you give God.
[1:32:24] Look in the whole day. How much time do
[1:32:27] you spend in prayer?
[1:32:30] The whole day. How much time do you
[1:32:32] spend listening to the word of God?
[1:32:35] The whole day. How much time do you
[1:32:38] spend reading the word of God?
[1:32:42] How much time do you spend talking about
[1:32:44] the Lord? All these things reflect.
[1:32:48] How close we are to God.
[1:32:51] Praise the name of. So we need to see
[1:32:54] every day God gives me opportunity to
[1:32:56] live.
[1:32:58] I want to live for him. Praise the name
[1:33:01] of I want to live holiness to God.
[1:33:06] My life that is dedicated.
[1:33:08] My heart is given to him. My spirit is
[1:33:11] given to him. My body is given to me. My
[1:33:15] family is given to me. Everything about
[1:33:18] me is given to him. May God bless you.
[1:33:23] Amen. Amen. [applause]
[1:33:27] Let us stand up and sing that song. Know
[1:33:30] you not. Know you not. You are the
[1:33:31] temple.
[1:33:36] As the song leader comes.
[1:33:40] Knowing not knowing not you are the
[1:33:46] temple.
[1:33:49] No,
[1:33:51] no, [singing] not you are the temple.
[1:33:58] No, [singing] not knowing
[1:34:02] you are the temple.
[1:34:06] You are the temple of the Holy
[1:34:12] Ghost.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, I know.
[1:34:16] Yes, I know. I am that temple.
[1:34:23] Yes, I know. Yes, I know. I am that
[1:34:28] temple.
[1:34:32] Yeah.
