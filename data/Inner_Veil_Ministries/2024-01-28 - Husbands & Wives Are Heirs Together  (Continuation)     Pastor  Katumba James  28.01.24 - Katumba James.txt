========================================

you so he requires you to show it to express it praise the name of the Lord but not paying evil for evil but where they meet evil you pay with good pay with Good Will desire the best for the other praise the name of our Lord and this how we shall have our families together praise the name of our Lord so God has called us as husband and wife to be hairs together and hairs of good things hairs of the blessings of God haers of the promises that God has promised us as a husband and the wife and you see the Bible says that if the wife is grieved you know he can hinder the prayers of the husband because here you are two who have become one but then the other part is Grievious about what you so you need to see that you reconcile let your mind be one then the Bible says when you become angry don't allow the son to go over your you don't want to talk to the other come and eat food that's terrible don't create a bad environment for yourself and then you see sometimes when you try to say that I'm showing that I'm annoyed you may end up getting sickness out of it stress stress pressure this this you shouldn't do that learn to say in your heart know there are some people but the B says forgive unconditionally forgive whether he comes whether she whether he doesn't come or she doesn't come forgive and don't have a grudge in your heart yesterday she did this and this the other day he did this I'm no longer forgiving this one no no no no that's not a Christian but as a Christian learn to bear with your husband or wife helping your children you know they may hurt you certainly and let me say as we live together one way or another you hurt the other but now if every part every time we Hur one another you want to leave go back after they didn't me how are you going to raise your children so they also think about coming home even at home I will go I will go doesn't work like that but learn to bear with one another learn to be concerned about the other one's grien praise the name of our Lord let us go to Genesis chapter 21 and then verse 9 so the Bible says and Sarah saw the son of Hagi the Egyptian which he had born unto Abraham more King wherefore she said Abraham cast out this born woman and her son for the son of this Bor woman shall not be with my son even with Isaac now you see trouble here it is Sarah who told Abraham produce a child with and Abraham went they got the child now when hag was pregnant started despising s and then sah had to just chase her away again she came back she gave birth and now here Sarah has given birth to Isaac and then ishma is despising is sah that she wouldn't with these people anymore and then she went the husband Cast [Music] Away this born woman and her son not your son but her son in other words I'm cutting him away from you chase them away for the son of this Bor woman shall not be here with my son even Isaac now you look at righteous Abraham the Bible says it was very [Music] Grievous in the sight of Abraham because of his son such troubles can come at but then what do you do Abraham so sorrowful so sad but the wife had taken a stand praise the name and these things happen at home you get a relative or you get a mate or you get a house help and then the other party says I don't want to find this person here at home but he's the one who helps me does this prise the name of like maybe you have a at home and then your wife says I don't want that girl around don't now start see what has she done don't start asking what has she praise the name of our Lord troubles keep on coming and sometimes maybe they are relatives you know maybe your brother or your sister or your wife says I don't want that now you see the situation that Abraham had his own side and because of thy born woman in all that sah has said unto thee Heen unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be called now you see how it was tough for Abraham to send away ish but that's what would bring peace at home so then you need to seek what can bring peace at home praise the name of our Lord you need to seek what the solution here you know and then something can start from somewhere and then it brings a terrible arent the husband and the wife and then another will start thinking maybe the wife will start thinking because I'm a woman you think you think I don't have decisions to make and then the husband will think you are despising me and then now you start looking at other things you despising because you get more money then the wife can start thinking something else you are despising me because of ABCD shouldn't go those kind of far but then see how you can reconcile don't attach those things to other things and you see don't create room for the devil to come at your those differences don't allow it to go further otherwise they can exaggerate things and then you pile one thing on top of another one thing on top of another one thing on top of another one thing on top of another at the end of the day you find a small difference has become so wide until people don't want sleep on the same day terrible differences they don't want to sleep in the same bedroom ah the wife sleeps in the bedroom the husband sleeps where the children sleep or the husband sleeps in the sitting room terrible differences but yet you started something small that could easily be reconc so you don't hold the grud and you as a God-fearing person take the step of being humble be the one to be humilated allow allow to take the blame I am sorry or if the other part is demanding something and you find it is hard you find say okay let us do the way you are talking about you are allowed to take the pain praise the name of our allow to take the pain allow to take it upon you for the sake of winning the other praise the name of our Lord that you can live together so Abraham took the pain to let his son away to be able to have peace with Sarah and that's the same thing we should look at our homes our families differences can come up from anywhere but you know learn not to allow that difference to put you away because we are joint hairs praise the name of our we are joint and don't pick up a difference of the other you know every day she does this if you have talked about it why do you want to repeat it all the time praise the name of our Lord because the Bible says that if you repeat an even separate friends in other words you are continuously grieving the other until one one time one temper will just flare and then just shouts praise the name of if if the one is having a thing if one is having a San the noise of the sapan will tell you how hungry they are now you shouldn't reach that kind of level praise the name of our Lord we are called to be haers together people can live together in people can live together in harmony praise the name over and now let me say this the husband or wife you have there is no better husband there's no better wife than what the Lord has given there's no don't put imaginations I wish my wife looked like this so you want take her for plastic be content but my husband I wish this party had not like this be content with what God has and then pray to God and thank God for him thank God for her praise the name of our Lord and let me say another thing there is no better person who understands you better than your husband or no person is better to understand you better than your husband or your wife praise the name of our Lord so don't pray for the other to die first don't wish the other anything evil but rather said Lord bless my husband Lord bless my wife Lord continue guiding us Lord continue leading Us Praise the name of the Lord that's how home should be and then you know you age you know you are moving and you know you are just like you've started until when you count the number of years you've been with you get surprised hey we have made this number of years how has it been the way they says count your blessings and then you'll see what the Lord Has Done praise the name of our Lord let us learn to live in harmony with one another even when your wife is not believing even when your husband is not believing cherish her as the best cherish him as the best I love my wife I love my husband be happy with them praise the name of our be happy with them bear with them in their weaknesses we are joint hairs we are called be hairs together praise the name of our Lord so then whether they are in the body of Christ or they not in the body of Christ give them the respect as a husband or as a wife praise the name of our Lord and then they will have a testimony praise the name of our Lord and then you are raising children you are showing them an example praise the name of our Lord we need to see that we obey the of God and we do everything how the Lord wants us to do we go to Romans chapter 8 praise the name of our Lord Romans chapter 8 and then verse 17 the Bible says and if children then then hairs hairs of God and Joint hairs with Christ so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together amen says we are hairs with Christ and if we are children we are join tears with him now that is in Salvation even now in our marriage the Bible says the Two Become One the two become one so when the two become one then they have the same position they have the same kind of things praise the name of our Lord you know you share the same food you eat of the same food like the Bible talks about in second Samuel and then chapter 12 verse when the prophet naan was talking to David in a parable about whom he had taken because of so now here the Bible says in verse three but the poor man had nothing save one little e Lam which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter for amen now he's saying he's talking about and said now this was brought up had been bought and then nowed up and grew up together with him praise the name of Lord so husband and wife should also grow up together as your thinking changes let it move together praise the name of our Lord growing up together developing together you know you Desiring for each other praise the name of our Lord if you have bought for yourself shoes but also for your wife praise the name of our Lord if you want to eat good food let your wife also eat of the same you know there there are some people like in some places you go to you get early in the morning you know in some of those joints where they prepare food and then you get many there spting but when you go to their homes the the husband is too big his wife is too small even the children that's not right the other man can spend 5,000 or 10,000 a day but even 500 shs at home doesn't want to leave no they not consider it but then the Bible says she was eating of his own meat she was growing together with so everything had shared the and should be in our homes also praise the name of our Lord desire the best thing for your wife or for your husband that's what should be in your mind praise the name of our Lord not your own alone your own self every good thing me every good thing every good thing me we shouldn't take the spirit of hm he started thinking ah but who who can the king think about is me then he started lasting after the throne let the king's hor be given to him let the king's crown be put on himing person so we need to desire the best for the other not for our own selves but let the other first receive then I come in last praise the name of the Lord that's a right attitude to bring it to our home so ham after he had said all all his kind of deadd dreaming they told him prepare be first go do that to go do that his enemy come to H to H him on the he to seek the permission and then the Lord turned things around like praise the name of our Lord we need to desire the best for the other if I find something good let me desire for my my husband let me desire it for my wife praise the name and then you live in harmony you live in that kind of love of God and the Bible says love as Brethren you know you know your husband is the son of the king your your wife is the daughter of the king now if you take them as that praise the name of Allah like here we have a president the children are married now maybe one of the sons inw mistreats the daughter how the president feel even scares you that should be the same thing why should I treat the child of the king why should I treat the daughter of the king why should I treat the son of the king that is not pleasant praise the name of our Lord we need to have that conscience and see that let me do my part as f as I can God giving me Grace praise the name of and let us not be doing let us not be well doing but doing all that we can for the glory of the Lord praise the name of our Lord we are called to be haers together so then even the way we treat one another should be to the glory of God praise the name of our Lord let us go back to First Peter chapter 3 as I try to finish First Peter chapter 3 and then we read in in verse seven likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being hairs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered amen says deal with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife now in Matthew chapter 19 and then verse seven they said unto him why did Moses then command to give a right of divorcement and to put her away Matthew 19:7 and he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so now the Bible says because of the hardness of heart the hardness of heart of the husband and as a husband if you have hardness in your heart to watch your wife take it away be kind because the Bible says she's a weaker vessel but you are also a weak vessel but the other one is weaker so then you take away the hardness of the heart and then you see that you always seek the grace of God in the challenges that you are facing in your family praise the name of our Lord see that you seek the grace of God we have a stuation here come down and help out of this mess there's misunderstanding here come and help out of this misunderstanding thetion that is taking place here it's not pleasant come and you know solve it and then you allow the Lord to take over your situation and then you pray for one another you seek the Lord for one another Lord help my husband Lord help my wife and then you desire the best for the other praise the name of the Lord and then you don't come to your husband you don't come to your wife despising them no the Bible says giving honor you know respecting one another and you know sometimes the devil always wants to bring in things to make people at Lads but it should not be so praise the name of our Lord you know there shouldn't be hardness there shouldn't be unforgiving spirit and you know when you don't forgive you are tormented if you don't forgive you are tormented you may I'm not tormented but the Bible say the servant dat when he refused to forgive a fellow dat because the other man had only 500 and he was failing to pay the de then another had 50,000 and he was failing to pay the debt and then he went to the king and started saying oh King forgive me I'm failing my businesses are failing you know somehow there are failures that come in life and then you seek Mercy from the Lord Lord forgive me and then the Lord forgives me so when the other servant of 50,000 was forgiven he went to a fellow servant whom was demanding 500 and said Pay me then the fellow servant told him please be merciful to him be merciful to him he said no no no pay me pay me pay me now the other servants went and told the king this man you've forgiven is's not forgiving the other the king called this man said I call you said for you if I forgiven you much why don't you forgive this little and that's what the Lord looks at us he has forgiven us much why don't we forgive one another forgive your children forgive your parents forgive your husband forgive your wife why and so what the scripture says the Lord appointed tormentors to tment this man until he pays and the tormenters they are demons you don't forgive demons just come in your heart and they torment you praise the name of our Lord learn to forgive so the Bible says because of the hardness of heart but now the hardness of heart has has been taken care of by the blood of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord where there is hardness in my heart let me apply the blood of Jesus because the blood of Jesus Christ there is nothing it can't work on praise the name of the Lord the blood of Jesus Christ works on all our condition if we can only bring them to the Lord and say Lord have mer Lord help me to reconcile with my husband Lord help me to reconcile with my wife Lord help me to reconcile with my parents concern with my children say that everybody can be free with you not having anything against and that's what God has called us as children of God may God bless you amen amen let us sing a song and then we can pray I think each of us will be able to pray is that song what a fellowship what a
