let's just keep that vision of Jesus Amen let's keep focused there are so many things on the sides when you look on the side you fall off but keep your vision on Jesus amen so I was asking whether sister Stella is here I think she is uh can you please stand up Sister ah not here yet okay we shall see her later do you love him amen so we stand up and go to our scripture reading before we do let's bow heads in order of prayer father we give thanks and honor for the grace that you preferred to us Lord that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us we come before your presence trusting in that grace that brought you all the way from Heaven down to earth to pick us clean us and have fellowship with us father in that Grace we pray that you may be present as we read the word and teach it encourage us heavenly father and whatsoever needs we have we trust that in your presence Heavenly Father you are going to meet every need bless your children in a special way in the teaching of the word in Jesus name amen amen so I want once again to greet you in the precious name of our Lord amen and to have the confidence that is going to speak to us we turn to the book of uh St Luke amen chapter 10 and verse 17 it's going to be word of encouragement this morning because the journey has been a very long one and we are still going it's just like when you are running a race some of you who have done Sports you come to a point where you feel like you can't take it but the people who cheer you on they keep saying you can overtake that you can overtake that and you keep overtaking and at the end of the day you celebrate winning the race for us to win the race is just to make the mark of the high calling in Christ amen so St Luke chapter 10 verse 17 and the 17 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy and he said unto them I beheld Satan as a light and for from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you they came back rejoicing that when we stand no demon stands you see all the diseases and everything so Jesus confirms to them that I've given you all the power you need for the service of the ministry but then he pointed to the them the greater part that they should keep their eyes on and he says in verse 20 not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven may the Lord had blessing the reading of his word amen you may be seated now Jesus said that our names are written in [Music] heaven isn't that wonderful you know when you have something that's precious you don't keep it anywhere where anybody can access it you keep it far away where the most cannot reach amen so that you know all the time you are sure that it is totally secure amen so God chose to keep your names in heaven if they were here on Earth maybe some bad man would access them and choose to hurt you but he has hidden these names so seual in heaven where the devil cannot get amen and so I have for a title this morning the names in heaven amen the names in heaven of recent we have so much search for Power and manifestations of the gifts in the church that's very common in Chom but today we shall put our emphasis on the better option the joy of our names being written in heaven so I have referred to it as the better option I did not mean the other part is not important because Jesus even confirm and says that no I've given you power To Tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you so but the better option is that your name is written in heaven are you happy that your name is written in heaven so we shall look at what the names are and when they were written how the names have over time been secured and also how today those names are being revealed praise the Lord I'll take you into court of the Prophet as we build the foundation here Amen in the message hidden life with Christ he says we were in God's for knowledge you see this is how you should look at yourself don't you think that all of a sudden God just saw you somehow somewhere and then he says okay you also come the scripture says you were in the full knowledge of God and this is so special and I want you to look at it from us you know with spiritual Revelation he says we when God's for knowledge we were saved before the foundation of the world isn't that a powerful statement you were saved before the foundation of the world theologically somebody would say that very wrong but with the eye of Revelation it makes it a very powerful thing to see that you were able to receive Christ as your personal savior amen because you know maybe we shall take this scripture to back that up in John 5 and verse 24 amen you love him this morning amen so John 5 verse4 very ver I say unto you he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me everlasting life you believe because you have everlasting life you don't believe to receive everlasting life you believe because you've always had eternal life you were secured before the foundation of the world this is what actually brother Bram is trying to say he's looking [Music] behind where before you make your confession for Christ your confession for Christ only confirms that you've always been in him before the foundation of the world Amen so he says we were saved before the foundation of the world Jesus came to die for those who God by for knowledge had elected Amen in for knowledge he elected them and when that last one that's the reason we are having Rev amen pulling with the Nets everywhere and trying to S out and S out that's ministers but when the last one is took out that's all of them amen there will be a last elected one amen so I want you to understand that you are here because God for you amen you must come to the bottom of that you shouldn't say I'm here because maybe my father gave birth to me when I was you know they were in church you see that's not what you should take as a son or daughter of God you should come to the Revelation that God knew you before the foundation of the world so I'll be working around this profound statement of our Prophet amen when it says we were saved even before the foundation of the world so the names of the El were of the lamp's book of life before the foundation of the world and brother Bram is calling it The lamp's Book of Life not on the lamp's book but the L's book of life there are some people who appear in a book and those people they've got the same nature and the same character and the same manner of life with the lamb that's why they are kept in the Lamb's Book of Life not their lives but the Lamb's Book of Life until happen this morning that you exist on the Lamb's Book of Life The Book of Life where the character and the life of the lamp is prescribed or is defined amen and you happen to be part of that so these have surrendered their lives as a sacrifice there are so many things they've given up they could have gone into there but there is something that keeps beckoning them come unto me heav give praise the Lord so you surrender those things and your name simply because your name was put on the last book of life in heaven the foundation of the world praise the Lord if you catch this it's going to be your encouragement and I want to say that the world Listen Now the world where we live was made specifically amen for those who are on the Lamb's Book of Life together with me the devil here on Earth and all his disciples they are squs amen but this Earth belongs to you it was created for the sons of God and that's why God will have to secure it by the purification amen and he's going to purify it by fire and then we shall finally possess it he take away all those that were not in the Lamb's Book of Life so that you can come and come back to the purpose of the creation and this book you the only way can write a book is because it's in my mind are you together with me that's the only way I can write a book because that book is in my mind it has to exist in my mind before it comes in the book before it comes on the pages I don't want to teach the teachers who are here I don't know whether Rogers has written books yet amen but there is no way you can write a book when what you want to write is not in your mind it has to be in your mind before it can get to the pages of the book oh praise the Lord so this book is the mind of the writer amen that means we existed in the mind of God for us to be part of that we existed in the mind of God the mind of God I want you to understand it from the angle of God himself not to understand it on your angle understand it in the angle of God the mind of God is existence amen when God is thinking it is there that's the way the mind of God is that's why in Isaiah 9 ver he could say unto us a son is Born the rest of the people could look around but in the mind of God when God thinks it is UN existence so the mind of God is UN existence that's why John the Revelator could say and I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of preped as a bride aded for her husband it was a real and yet it is a future thing but John says I saw it before God it was real amen that's the mind of God praise the Lord Brother Bram says in thean chap Church watch carefully and see this before there was ever a SP of Stardust before God was God God is an object of worship an object of adoration and there was no one to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God Amen and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride the bride was already in his mind praise the Lord when there was no creation when there was no stust before there was anything The Pride was on the mind of God yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about these thoughts of God they are eternal are they not hallelujah hallelujah he says what about the thoughts of God Amen he pointing at sistera pointing at brother Ronald here he says what about these thoughts of God put yourself in there and then he says are they Eternal they are Eternal praise the Lord so I am not a product of time this body could be a product of time but the real me here is eternal in the heavens amen that's why he sees me seated in Heavenly places Christ Jesus praise the Lord amen so uh he continues to say the Eternal thoughts of God now when he's talking about this eternal thought is not talking about ideas which God has is talking about people who in the mind of God the of the Lord Jesus Christ they originate from thought let me tell you friends there is no man who will say anything without it proceeding from the mind it has to come from the Mind before it can become a word oh hallelujah hallelujah so when God f of us God would come now and put the thought into us and he says Let There Be oh Hallelujah let us make man in our own image praise God yes sir I was there before the foundation of the world don't look at this this is a product of time amen and it dies away until God will raise it again for now it dies away but there is something in there which does not die that's the one I'm talking about which was in the thoughts of God which is referring to the Eternal thoughts of God let ask you the thoughts of God Eternal he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and he knows the end from the beginning because he God that's the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has grown up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal part of God that's God praise God and brother Bram preached a message does God change his mind about his word he doesn't change his amen you are written Epistles word of all men you are God's word made manifest are you together with me praise the Lord that's how special you are you come from God I thought that's Eternal and I want to say friend God canot change his mind about you hallelujah hallelujah you will say committed a mistake the other day yes that's why he allowed the blood because you were eternal you only mess up because of this but deep down on the side there there is an eternal SE that already has eternal life praise God David said my substance was not hidden from the When I Was Made In Secret and curiously wrote in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my yet being UNF book where all my members written which in were fashion when as yet there was none of them Hallelujah Hallelujah that is David he says God show my existence and the prophet says these who are the Royal seed and the elect of God and the predestinated for of God and in the mind of God and his thought where did you come from you come from God let me tell you the trials you go through cannot rob you from the mind of God hallelujah hallelujah was so that at one time he was sinking l but God come now and says got yourself like a man I want talk to you where were you when I created the heavens he wants to bring most I mean Joy to the realization that this which is going through the trials this which is jobless this one here which doesn't have a child that you cry for daily it's just a passing kind of dust but the inside of you you come from God you just forgot who you are because you byass your are you together with me but God is telling Jo you were there when the sons of God shouted for I was there and I believe that all of you were there when the sons of God shouted for there was a worshiping moment up there brother amen and brother Bram says in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season hallelujah hallelujah that's how God allows them to come for there are those who come in the days of Noah there are those who come in the days of Moses there are those who come in the days of the Prophet there are those who come in the days of lther designated season now every SE came forth the right season are you together with me every seed came at the right season to meet your temptation to meet your trial this is the worst age but this is where God wanted you to go this is The Edge where you can be able to overcome brother Bram says in those previous ages you know it was Inquisition amen and he says that was easy but in this time the trials of the BR is more [Music] sophisticated amen we are being tried by the things that we think are necessary for life are you together with me so brother Bram looking at the trials of this hour amen where we are under pressure Amen in where we are not fitted to leave he preached a message how can I overcome but yet is the age of the Overcomer that will bring down the throne amen so your name was placed in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah hallelujah when we talk about the name we are talking about your character that your character was registered together with the character of the lamb and was placed in the same book Hallelujah hallu you are there in a family tree amen you are a son of God so you have the character of God you got the traits of God but the problem is that you are behind this curtain of time this curtain of time sometimes makes it difficult for you to understand who you are you are limited because you are covered by this flesh amen but then your name up there rather is in heaven your character is a Heavenly character what we call to overcome is look away from what the world offers us so that we can look to Jesus the and finish of our Salvation hallelujah hallelujah you are here because the author started the work amen the trials are there but the author began a work a work which he can never fail to finish praise the Lord so you are going to show how you are going to manifest the life of the Lamb here on Earth that's what you are called for to live like the love to love like the love to forgive like the that's the life of the are you together with me that's what we're called for brother you cannot fail if you come from God it's not you it's the life of the Lamb which was given to you you were given that life to love your wife to love your husband you cannot fail that's the life of the Lamb which God has given to you you can't fail to forgive that's the life of the L praise God so look at what a name is a name is anonymous with character a name speaks of a Divine reputation the of God upon a man's life that's a name and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was Mother of all living that was her reputation she was Mother of good and bad and and so she got a name from that nature are you together with me so the name speaks of character and that's why when the character of Jacob change even the name change from Jacob to Israel from a to with God when the character of Abraham CH even the name change from abrah to Abraham father of Nations from Sarah to Sarah from sa to Paul Hallelujah hallu and when you were born again your name or call it your character is also changed from son God Amen I'm not identified by this I'm identified by the SE gen on amen amen the character changed when you were born again from a smoker to Christian from a you had a change of character and they were called Christians in Antioch because they lived like a Christ amen so Redemption is looking for those whose lives were synonymous with that of the lamb and we already put in the Lamb's Book of so you not lose any of them he just goes around and he says yeah where are you then he allows situations to come in your life so that you may hate this and then you start thinking I looked for God no he's looking for you he allows you to be in the cent of the storm and then you start crying like a Jonah in the belly of the well you don't even start saying oh Father I prayed I no God is calling you he has read your name here and he knows you a special person amen he starts looking around and then he says [Music] okay praise the Lord then you know the things that you always love you start developing doubt you fight them they punch your punch they punch your punch didn't I have fought a good fight huh are you fighting a good fight PCH back and at one time you are going to get at the top of the praise the Lord so Redemption is God looking for those whose names are in heaven they have always been a part of God but were trapped they were trapped in sin due to the hybrid body are together with me because if Adam and Eve didn't get into this body they would have not Fallen amen you see this is a very bad body even when God comes into this body brother it starts working on him Abraham looked at him and he started seeing coming from Oblivion and then he comes he comes and the near he came the greater the power radiating out of him and Abraham called him my Lord but still he saw him tired this body are you together with me when Jesus went to pray and fast this body here even if he was God he got hungry this [Music] body are you together with me so you have to fight a nature deep down on their side you've always been a child of God that's why you take your time to come here that's why you take your time to fight against your weakness because you feel you don't belong here you just C in here amen amen do you love him listen the love with which God Loved You is eternal is eternal a love which you not fail so what God wants you to do is to rise and start living a life the gospel you begin to pray you begin to cry you begin to identify weaknesses you begin to identify failures and report them to God God wants to know that you know who you want to be that's where comes in to help you to make the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus you know brother Bram was a very special man he knew how to bring great facts from simple stories so I'm talking about this eternal love brother Bram talks of a hunting friend called Mr B whom he referred to as the meanest man he knew mean means but he liked him because he taught him how to hunt when they would go out there hunting brother Bram never sh anything for fun he always sh so that he could get food are you together with me but this young man here he would shoot phones which are young which is is just trying to walk that's how bad he was you know he thought by so doing he would met the heart of brother Bram he used to call Brother Bram a chicken hearted preacher so he had a whistle this Mr B he would blow and once he blows it it always sounded like you know this deer deer like it was [Music] crying for it mother and this time one time you know a de walked out straight to the face of Mr not scared it was in Hand of its baby that's a de let me ask you if a DE could risk its life to get it baby how about God could he leave you like that he could [Music] blow and then you know that's a little deer and the mother dear would come he ready to die for his son are you together with me Jesus came out in the face of death looking for you and looking for me Amen brother Bram story I turned my head when that man blew and the deer came towards him he says I turn my head and I started real soft pray Lord don't let him do that this mother is looking for his baby okay that poor mother's out there looking for her baby she can't help it there is something in her she's born a mother and there is a baby in trouble regardless of danger they don't know any danger they move out and I waited and I waited and the gun never went off and I turned to see the gun was going like this he looked up to me great big tears running down his cheek he threw the gun on the ground and grabbed me by the pants I said Billy I have had enough of it right here on this noow B teach me that Jesus that you talk about he just couldn't what was it he had seen something real he seen something displayed that wasn't put on it was something genuine they on the no bank I led that cruel hearted sinner to the Lord because a mother dear could display something real else could ever separate the Bible say a mother may forget [Music] baby but never can I forget you your name engraved upon the palm of my heart amen is's the one that give you eternal life praise God he presented that eternal love in that dramatic story that this dear came forward in the first of death to redeem a child did the master come from Heaven did he put on flesh and come in the first of danger to redeem you and me is worth to be praised is worthy to be glorified amen that eternal love that he had for the names greater love than the mother dear amen that's the love that brought him on Earth to be mocked by the Pharisees and to be stripped naked the Roman [Music] soldiers he stood in the face of death for you and me he was hang between heavens and earth for my S for that reason I want to Echo the Lord's words that do not rejoice because demons are subject to you but because our names are written in heaven my my my my my because of those names he came down in the face of death amen you talk about those names they were not only put in the book but when they were put in the book they were also sealed with seven seed hallelujah hallelujah that the devil could not PL them out before the blood has been applied praise the Lord amen the name are eternally loved of God and put under etern he sealed you to your Eternal destination you are sealed until the day of your Redemption praise the Lord I love him amen I've over you know I have over the ages I've seen you sealed and secure not in the father's left hand but in the father's right hand I wish I could make this real to you that the father has you sealed with Seven Seals and as if that's not enough he placed you in his own right hand in Revelation 5 the bride was sealed by Seven Seals and no man in heaven where El and was found wor to release the identity of these names through the edges who is worthy to open the book and lose the seals the Bible says and no man in heaven not in Earth NE Earth was able to open the book look there the names over the ages sealed and that's why you could never die until you came to the Altar and said Lord forgive my you were secure from all forms of accidents from all kinds of diseases amen I don't know what happened through your life but the SE of God upon your life could not be broken Rejoice because your names are written in heaven praise the Lord these names were on the mind of God and Christ already died for the name in the mind of God before the foundation of the world can you imagine because in the mind of God God thinks it's a reality can you see that this morning when God thinks it's a reality look at Revelation 13 and verse eight and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship the Antichrist whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world the lamp in the mind of God was already slain before you committed the first that's why you are a Christian today because God was training you to catch you at the right time amen and when he called you at the right time talk about the conviction talk about the pain of the life that you had lived that God may have mer upon you hallelujah hallelujah the lamb was found worthy and it died on Calvary Amen to open the book that holds the name so in the process he had to be born in our domain in order to become a Kinsman amen so he had to be tested by the same elements that caused man sin in the Garden of Eden John says the last of the eyes the last of the Flesh and the pride of life amen but he went through all those but he Sanctified himself to meet the standard of the Redeemer amen John 179 for their sakes I sanctify myself I offer myself I go through the requirement amen that I may be found the Redeemer to redeem this name hallelujah hallelujah they were on my mind and now when they came into the flesh they fell I have to go in the same domain the domain of the Flesh and overcome so that I may die for them and redeem them back to amen for we have a high priest which was touched with the feelings of our infirmities but in all points like we are yet without amen that way he to take our because he finally was found without sin and because he had not seen even if he died death could not hold that's why he was able to pay the price the Wes of sin is death so he went into death but he could come back because there was no on Amen so you know first Peter 3:18 for Christ also has once suffered for the for the UN that he may bring us to God so without sin he offered himself at the cross he had the power he had the ability to put down his life and take it back again and he was in this flesh here this is an attraction for sin are you together with me so when he said you know the when God moved then all the sin of the world Came Upon him on the cross he was an ad he was a he was a murderer he was a witch all the sin from when he fell and all the to the last elected one attracted to him but the difference between Adam and him is that Adam was made a living soul but this Christ he was a lifegiving spirit hallelujah hallelujah so he allowed to die and the Holy Spirit went and Rose him from the dead and by so doing he had captured every nature of sin upon himself every ofil the are you together with me he took it and took it back to the devil he went into hell and gave him his bagage of sin that's why the resurrection you will be perfect without sin or Rec because your sin were thrown back to the devil and The Temptations of time the voice of God is allowing you to take it under the BL every given time every given time so the devil is frustrated today you are perfect because you are making use of the blood so that has nothing to do with you I don't know whether you see what I'm saying amen amen he redeemed us and possessed every name which was in the book and then he started calling all the names that had died from Adam to the time of the they came up and the Bible says Jerusalem saw them and they were taken up if they were taken up me also nothing will stop me are you together with me yes sir I said this morning I wanted to encourage you to look at yourself and understand why the scripture say we are seated in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus amen so he began to call us how does he call us God is calling names this morning do you know how he calls it he shows you the word when you sayen and you mean it from the heart you are answering back to your name because what you believe gives you the character of the Lamb so you get identify with the nature that you we in Al's book of life amen so our names are written in heaven let me say this where there is no but election and in every age these names were kept Above the Law even in the time when the law of Moses was active the names in the Lamb's Book of Life kep Above the Law amen let me say this in the Garden of Eden they were by the blood innocent love that was taking them above the judgment under the law of Moses these names [Music] were on the day of the Feast of atonement their sin was atoned for and the daily sacrifice the Believers were kept Above the Law that's why there's no judgment until that day on Calvary when he died all the names that were written in heaven right from to the thief on the cross all the way to the last elected you see when the voice said the lion of the tribe of Judah prevailed to take the book and lose the Nam there John took some time and he was not seeing it and brother Bram says the reason why John took moments to see is because when the lion became the lamb he had to go back all the way from to all the names to come to where would see and then that same it flowed and covered all the seven [Music] churches when you get saved in reality you find the blood on the altar you find the blood on the altar this may be too much for you but that's the truth amen so where you would perish committed after C there is constant blood which flows from Emmanuel's veins to address your dat areas even now never come to a point where you think that you are Beyond repair I'll take you to First John chapter 1 and verse 8 can somebody say Amen praise the Lord first John 18 if we say that we have not sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US Paul specified his letters to the Gentiles except for the book of Hebrews but John Peter and James always wrote to the Believers that were Jews and were disast among the Gentiles among them there were people who had jistic attitude amen where they think they are above sea the Pharisees that would go into the temple to pray and they would punch their test and say thank you I press such a number of times a day I don't do like this I don't do like this I am not like that public the lord gave us that example so Paul were WR I mean John Peter and James their letters address those kind of people and that's why he says here we say that we have no se we deceive ourselves and the truth is not this always believed they were a sinless bunch soled with attitude of the Pharisees but I want you to know that this one here is a hybrid body it's a CO the seed is on the inside so we all make mistakes in life and some of them are FAL but today we thank God for Calvary are you together with me so verse n if we confess our sins is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness unrighteousness he says all unrighteousness take a moment and search yourself he's willing to take away all your unrighteousness just this morning take it under the blood your to God mention it to him don't imagine your forgiveness but speak with your mouth and said God I want your grace God I am a drunkard God I am a confess because confession is power are you together with me in verse 10 if we say that we have not SE we make him a liar and his word is not in us so the blood on the altar today is your eternal security did you hear that the blood on the altar is your eternal security and this eternal security was played out in Revelation 5 amen when the book was in the hand of theer Hallelujah Hallelujah he was not willing to release you until the lamb di hallelujah hallelujah until the lion of the tribe of Judah took the attribute of a lamb and took the book he was Dripping with blood to my he was Dripping with blood to secure your name every name is called out into the Bri no called out into the blood hallelujah hallelujah have you been redeemed have you said amen to the call ofation your call bles you under the blood so whenever this leads you into error speak about it put it under the blood Amen Let us look at this amen are you together with me so the book in the Tabernacle of Moses the book in the Tabernacle of Moses was represented by the two tablets that were put in the AR seal by the that's now what represented the book where the names are it was put in a box which is called the AR of the Covenant and the AR of the Covenant was covered by a piece a plate of wood amen like this and now on this there were the throne the Throne of God himself and now on that Throne there were two chab that stretched out like this amen over the AR I want ask who could reach out and pl those names are you together with me that would somebody say are you together with me nobody could have the ability to PL those names because you have to remove God from his throne before you can read the book amen so ex 25 verse 22 on that throne and there I meet with thee and I will commune with thee from above the M seat from between the two chabs which are upon the Ark of the testimony of all things which I'll give thee in commandment unto the children of are you together with me he says on that Throne I'll be talking to you and let me tell you that M was always sprled with blood amen so what is SEC what power could open that security the names in the book but when the lamb came and redeemed the book at Calvary he held it in his right hand and the right hand is you know the father held it in his right hand and the right hand is symbolic of authority in the New Testament in the Old Testament in the AR of the coven under the M SE in the New Testament Jesus came amen I mean he came and uh redeemed the book from the hand of he that sat on the throne this redeeming here is not taking away the authority of eternal security but it is the revealing of what God has done for us amen I'll give you a quot here Jesus Christ the same yesterday done forever and we here that he said that he is the same then if he's the same is God the same is God to be the same in principle attitude in every way that he was the nothing in his word contradict anything of it but his which he raised up oh God raised up from the dead and said set the right hand of his majesty to make inter upon your confession he says he has been raised up and his on the right hand of the father making intercession father forgive him father strengthen Him Father give him more grace for the trials he going through give him more grace for the sicknesses he going through he loves you he cares for you he's there keeping every name above the condemnation of the Lord interceding for you and your confession today secures you amen you just come and confess I've atude I have this I have had that so there is a fountain filled with blood flowing towards every confessed SE amen so look away from our conditions to the temple of God where Jesus sits at the right hand of his majesty with blood to make inter Upon Our confession if you don't confess he intercedes for [Music] nothing you have to say something about yourself that's how God works upon I mean upon confession amen he says here sometimes I think I'm getting too old to may I tell you what I was even about 12 years older I'm 12 years old when he said that so I'm very old some times I think I'm getting too old to preach and then I go to sing something like that and I think I'm a young man it's it does something to you for I know this that there is someone there waiting for me just remember there is somebody waiting for you there is someone paid the price that I couldn't pay he did it for me he did it for you he did it for the whole human race and now he comes forth to claim his Redemptive rights hallelujah hallelujah to claim you and me his SEC claim it for who not for himself for us is one of us is our King Fox he's my brother he's my savior he's my God he's my King's redeemer is all for what I was I without him oh what would I be without amen so you see he my all he standing there as our King folks amen and now he's been interceding for us this now he comes forth and takes the book of redemption to claim his rights of what he died for are you together with me so now he doing his [Music] claiming in every age he claiming his own in every age is claiming his own and in this age I thank God that I am one of them hallelujah hallelujah are you one of them he has claimed you by the word praise God Amen that's why there is something in you which tells you you are not giving up hallelujah hallelujah sometimes you feel so low you feel so D but something in there tells you you are not giving up praise God Amen I was telling my family this morning that I've never felt this long amen but I don't know I said I'm going to preach any you come down here go takes over amen we thank God for his Redemptive power amen am I to B in myself who am I if it were not for his grace are you together with me just turn around and tell a brother it's the grace of God Amen your name was put there and God has been fighting all the way until he presents you a BRI without spot Rec that's what the Bible says he will present himself a bride not we present ourselves he will present himself a bride without without spot or he will take you through conditions he will take you through circumstances amen because you byass yourness to come down here and be try and when you overcome then welcome home amen praise the Lord eternal security God cares in chastisement he cares you cry in pain he says that's expression of my love praise God Amen so in the BRD message here brother Bram says and what did he do now he's been back here interceding until he blood has atoned for every person and the lamb now those was written in the book so he know from the foundation of the world their names were in there so you stood back here and done mediator work until everyone that's been put on from the book has been redeemed and is finished and he walks out praise God isn't that wonderful 1963 God released to us what Cal exactly means to us in the opening of the seals 1963 he gave us the understanding of what Cal means 1963 is the opening of the seals not The Happening of the seals is the opening of what God has been doing in the Plan of Redemption amen Cal the ransom for me the life of the sacrifice to come to the worshiper Cal madeb possible bless us into the rest Calvary washed every name in the blood of the lamb and today we are the righteousness of Christ did you hear that so nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the lamp's book of life before the foundation of the world and then he says and the book is unfolding it now are you together with me [Music] nothing shall be say except what was on the Lamb's Book of Life and he says he's unfolding it now so don't get tired he's calling the names on a daily basis and once you hear your name labor to manifest the life of the L okay yeah theice to redeem you learn to live a life of sacrifice give up things that you would have loved because he says for their sakes I sanctify myself you would have desired to visit a friend today but you gave the sacrifice to be here and he this okay so the prophet says he's unfolding the names now he says the book doesn't say now is to be saved in the time of this church age [Applause] all or whoever no it don't say that it just shows the mystery ourselves by Faith ourselves by faith we believe it that's how the names are called it's not saying that's not how the names are called The Calling of the names is the revealing of the word and when you the word you are answering to your name because when you believe the word super is creating the character of the love in your [Music] life are you together with me so once the word is preach just say it is mine you say Amen we have our exhortations every morning it's only the people whose names are in the Lamb's Book of Life that will have the joy of listening to those little Concepts because it designs them into what God wants them to do praise the Lord I was thinking and I thought that we shall participate together somehow I'll be calling somebody that tonight you pray with us so when I call somebody he'll send it to me and I'll put it on the platform okay we are in this together we in the journey together do you believe it yeah that's the way calling so how can you stay away when the names are being called as you catch the revelation you are catching your name it's changing your life it's making you identify with a particular character in the Lamb's Book of Life amen so only those on the book will be able to answer to their names by receiving the word by Revelation so all is waiting for the coming forth of the sons of God that are being called by the opening of the SE all nature is waiting for you so they are you know we are in the season of the unfailing of the sons of God God is calling them back to take back their nature which they fell from he's calling them by name and remember those names are you ordained person of the character of the Lamb hallelujah hallelujah amen so the character is with the character of the Lamb that's why you are in the book of the Lamb amen so now as you take the word will be sharing his life with you amen because he has hidden that life in the word as you believe the word it positiv affects your life and causes you to live a certain way and the way you live is the life of the Lamb you say I'm not what I used to be and then you stum a little bit you run back in the blood you come back happy and I still continue will you continue on this journey don't allow the devil to F you away because God wants to share with you his life he says upon your fa virt take virtue Hallelujah upon your virtue and knowledge he giving you virtue upon upon virt until you are going to be kept with Charity which is the B of perfection hallelujah hallelujah praise God that's a good Mark check yourself that Lord I still feel some bitterness here I want you to C me with charity amen I feel negative about the brothers and God have mercy there still something missing out I was impatient with brothers so and S and you were asking God Amen that you want to see your name in the L's book of life amen so when you see the lamb when you see the life of the Lamb Amen in your own life then your name has been called amen amen praise God so who is the bride who is the bride it is Christ simple it is Christ who is allowed by you iive take over your life that's the bride the bride is Christ when you allow him to take over your life that's the bride listen St of a perfect man God representing his church as a bride a woman God represents his church as a bride that's all the bride is Christ in you the hope of glory will you let him be amen will you let him be so now we are in the time of the revealing of the sons of God by the word amen is cing them with in Readiness for the body change are you together with me if did not know who she was until are you together with me Adam came out of his sleep look you know just imagine this woman she just imag she says who am I and by the S there is a sleeping man then when Adam Rose for me sleep he says hey you are born of my bones Flesh of My Flesh you shall be called woman because you were taken out of are you together with the character was that of the master are you together with me so Jesus is raising us to that level he can never return until we are literally the Flesh of his flesh there's no wayam could wake up out of his sleep amen with the actual presence of his wife how can I say there is no way would have come without the actual presence of his wife she had to be there for him to come up there's nowh Christ can come unless you are growing it his nature and then when he comes he say yes she's Flesh of My Flesh B of my B right now we are Spirit of his Spirit we in the invisible Union our his character has taken over but now when the last elected has grown to that level of Life of his life then finally we shall take the body CH so that we can be born of hish and then he will come down and says yes this is my wife hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen okay as we finish I want to take you First John 3 amen the names in heaven my God here to keep them far away from where the devil could reach so first John 31 behold what man of love the father has best taught upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because knew him now are we the sons of God now not tomorrow now we have been Justified we've been Sanctified we have been filled with the Holy Ghost we are Spirit of his spirit and moving into flesh of his fles now are we the sons of God because the spirit of God lives on the side and does not appear what we shall be but we know that when shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as we will not only be character of his character that we are becoming by believing the word but we shall also be born of his and flesh of his flesh this is what God is doing about us he's Ming us into the image of Christ in a spiritual character and then later as he is so and the more we are coming to his image is the more that rapturing nature we are building in US you come to a time and you just don't like yourself have you ever come to that time you desire something better you just wake up in the morning and you don't like what you are there is something you are yearning for every one of us is yearning for that the change of our body amen I'll give you two qu praise the Lord and everything we have need of for the Earthly Journey Divine Healing the power of God and all these other things is in every individual in here that has received the B of the Holy Ghost everything you have need of for the journey for you planted in Christ the Holy Ghost baptism and everything you have need of for this life's journey even the Rapture is in you is in you that life is in you so just keep feeding it have joy coming to the house of God Jo amen felling about the word praise God Amen my last qu the prophet says don't resent it that's the truth the rapture is in us now I prove it by the gospel those who are called he justified and those who are Justified he has glorified then in heaven today we are glorified in the presence of God right now I'm just pushing out to it hallelujah hallelujah praise God that's what we are to that's what God has made us he has kept our names up those names are your theop Hallelujah the Bible says there was 120 names in the upper room I don't know how many names are in heaven but thank God I'm one of them hallelujah hallelujah thank God we are one of them why because each time he calls I say yes Lord how does he call presenting his word a positive treat I believe it where I have a mistake I have the
