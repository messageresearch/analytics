these days [Music] oh let me hear your voice [Music] look at the way of Escape [Music] [Music] through foreign [Music] Christmas Day [Music] so God bless you everybody I want you to stand up and we go into the scripture reading and take a few minutes to put relevance to what we've been doing here now amen amen you see sometimes these weddings and marriages are reduced to functions and locations of entertainment which is very unfortunate so let's put relevance to what has been happening here today is amen amen so Ephesians chapter five I'm going to pick out one verse which is and he says this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church Heavenly Father Guru we thank you for the next phase of this service I pray that you may use your word to speak to us in Jesus name amen so I attack and [Music] a little Comfort new comfortable both of them are kids that have grown up before me um Brother Martin is my brother-in-law organized and then Comfort here comforting I wedded the father and then I dedicated the comfort and then I've wedded him to martini and again soon I'll be dedicating her twins [Applause] so this is a very big order money and I'm really excited for that yeah amen Amina so now we're Fusion is fine when you get time read it from verse 21. talks about the relationship between a husband and a wife now a man is the first one at the head because according to scripture the husband is the head of the family and God gives the man love but then he gives the woman unless the man has got the love are you together with me so it's very important because the Bible says that the man is the head of the family and now without understanding many people think that the scripture says that the man is the boss of the house it doesn't say that it says he is now we go back into the Book of Genesis and we see the creation of man when God created all these other animals but when it came to mind two phases all these animals were created in a flesh body yeah Yama they came a God was a goat and he got the ambition but when you study the scripture it's not the same foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you must be prepared for what you are going on that we get into marriage simply because now Martin is very busy he works three jobs which he does of course so now he has no time to wash his grace and what happens [Music] now when you marry on that order you are not marrying your wife when you marry on the order but a man must have children then you are just getting some kind of a factory to produce your children we really need to get back later into the way marriage was in Genesis now in Genesis if you can really take this together with them you'll see that before God allow Adam to become a husband he had to put him on a test yeah and walked before and he says that I want to see what you call those animals and the Bible says that was the name there [Music] I mean uh foreign [Music] but you will not have married the wife and one for the Bible definition and even a man as the Bible because when God created them it's not the Heights the character that had the ability to think like a god [Music] which thinks like a God then leads and guides a family that's where we can say that he is [Music] [Music] so that I can find where the water is he goes ahead of me he has got a voice that I need to listen to him because that voice is the voice of life that's why he says my sheep hear my voice leadership by example that Martin is going to exercise that is what makes the headship of a man because the head one of them does not lead by tormenting the body but the head becomes the mind to the body the head knows the time to go to tables the intelligence is not going to bully the body formula you see that's what marriage is oh for my naturality that's how God wanted it to be amen amen that a man doesn't speak into himself just looks at us Jesus his wife and then the wife says and it is exactly what he was very hard to believe is not common in the homes but once you become one body and you become one man there are certain things you are going to do and they are going to meet exactly the demand it happens amen amen so now the scriptures he says husbands love your wife if you fail in love you are not going to get submission prayed up we'll go on that one because the love of God is productive love [Music] amen it's a productive you don't just say oh God loved us and therefore but for God so loved the world Martin Monty that's the love of God not keep going home and telling Comfort I love you that's not the love of God the love of God is to express what you feel it's two words yeah let the works every quarterback you will get it when you go back sometimes the moods are not easy the kids have been disturbing huh and you just take a chocolate chocolate everything will be fine for the next one week you see this is what I tell my friends sometimes and I always even speak to the politicians [Music] that you see these people don't need your money my community they need your attention better than those are you that's all and the same with the wife your wife is not going to turn you down America I'm telling you the truth you'll find homes but inside those Mercedes benzes they are crying they are dying on the inside they've got very expensive dressing but they don't have the peace that marriage should produce you see Martin Martini you are the one who makes the marriage every morning you look for new tricks actually you've taken someone whose daughter would she really defeat you to keep her happy every morning as first we are talking about marriage just look for how you'll make her happy birthday that's all you need then you'll have the best food your kilos will be sorted out there she's also going to look for something new every morning because you make her happy [Music] you know [Music] to the Heavenly relationship that Christ has with this church so the scripture in Ephesians 5. tells the husband laughs you are lucky you've married in a very good family these ladies are married to one man you got certain families where you think you have married all the men in the house but the Bible says foreign [Music] she's not you know I mean she's not obligated to you um anyway she replied to me when she was walking you wanted that need for you is she your wife to your own husband and I have seen that brother James here is a very special man he became a father to that family after the father died at a younger age I traveled with him I want to finish and then we stayed in a house of a deacon of the church there he had just redesigned this church and then the man woke up and says I got a dream yeah [Music] amen Amina [Applause] so that we can respect you for that and those of you who are here including the bridegroom here that way you're not sponsored by James to go to school give respect to what brother James did for us [Applause] and not all of them are here but he paid the fees for them God bless you brother Alex he doesn't want to be said who he is one of the greatest newsmen we have in the country they came like a boys [Music] in the house speakers into very high levels of Education but that was only possible because he loved his wife if you didn't love her which she wouldn't have allowed that um the words we have the entirely now is failure on love if you love your wife everything is okay now put it there was a situation that you will go back home and study in the Book of Matthew chapter 22. from verse 25. there was a man you know the scribes with Christ by any Christian and you see they believed but for you to be a husband to a wife you must produce seed out of here but then they came and said the master there is a situation here that there is a woman who was married and then the husband died without C I ain't gonna come inside Guys Without sins whose wife shall she be I did that so that you may wake up to a point that I'm bringing Jesus answers Jesus in heaven there is no marriage we shall be like the angels of God do you hear that there is no marriage to you people who are married you are not going to make your marriage good in heaven you're married you see according to the scriptures there is going to come at times in the Book of Revelations when Jesus comes back yes to take what he calls the bride under the bride is the faithful Church in the same way that Martin is taking his wife comfortable so now the taking of the Saints is called the marriage of the Lamb of woman so this marriage which we exercise is a testimony that there is going to be a marriage will come for his church are you together with me so now listen foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] what you've entered in you are really aware of it you're not the responsibilities of the world when Rebecca was going to be married in the Bible Bible was there to take her yesterday she said yes so both of you Adam had to be ready and the woman is ready you've entered something that you are you know very well she makes herself ready yet and what makes her ready looking back into the marriage of Christ and his church verse 8 says that should be arrayed in finally clean and white for the finally then is the works of righteousness [Music] righteousness meaning that she is [Music] so Martin climatic it's love Gonza Marine character but then that love which marries the characters should be like the love of Christ that marries the church he knows our weaknesses I'm sure that you realize the weaknesses foreign on the road foreign [Music] to become wife and as you go you have got the responsibility to establish characters that when you get the children they will always be like the mother all the children and you know that we teach here but a mother it mama is the Fifth Gospel that's the children learn from as they started the Bible amen amen you reject them through Matthew's roommate but unless you make the 50 gospel you will not have children maintain that character that makes you the wife that you are God loves you and I just spread that both of you and make a very successful the Lord May bless you God bless you undertakings bless your children and remember you are just an athlete I know [Music] [Applause] so as they sing and they signed the certificate certificate amen Amina after that gems will
