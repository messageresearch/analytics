[32:04] amen how many are standing on Holy
[32:07] Ground this
[32:08] morning
[32:10] amen so you are all welcome to the house
[32:12] of the
[32:14] Lord and it's the best place for all of
[32:17] us to
[32:19] be we should always remember one another
[32:22] in
[32:24] prayer because the life on this other
[32:27] side of of
[32:30] Eternity is always full of
[32:33] Trials amen you remember brother
[32:37] George uh em in your
[32:41] prayers and sister
[32:45] alel uh brother's
[32:49] daughter uh she's not doing very
[32:52] well so each time you kneel
[32:55] down remember one another in
[32:59] prayers so before we go
[33:02] into uh the teaching of the word this
[33:07] morning I want us to remind ourselves of
[33:10] the words of brother
[33:14] Bram he says Bible teaching is usually a
[33:18] little
[33:22] treacherous amen you
[33:25] know kind of walking on
[33:39] the you see when you on the sea and it
[33:42] is snow it's
[33:46] winter some of those Seas
[33:51] freeze that people can drive over
[33:55] them but when the eyes I mean begins to
[34:02] melt a car driving on there can
[34:08] sink so he says
[34:10] here Bible teaching is usually little
[34:17] treacherous amen a little you know kind
[34:19] of walking on out on
[34:25] a but we just feel that
[34:29] maybe at this point and at this
[34:33] time it might be good to kind of bring
[34:36] the church to what I
[34:41] think a complete
[34:44] understanding
[34:46] positionally of what we are in Christ
[34:50] Jesus and sometimes I think that
[34:54] preaching is a wonderful thing
[34:59] but I believe sometimes brother
[35:02] B that teaching goes beyond
[35:06] that especially to the
[35:09] church now
[35:11] preaching usually catches
[35:15] a but after catching a
[35:18] sinner so
[35:21] what this preaching would bring him into
[35:24] the hands of a teacher
[35:29] to get a real Jewel out of
[35:33] him amen so now preaching usually
[35:37] catches The
[35:40] Sinner brings him under condemnation by
[35:43] the
[35:45] word but teaching places the
[35:50] man positionally what he
[35:53] is and he can never rightly be able to
[35:56] have faith
[35:58] until
[36:00] positionally we know what we are in
[36:05] Christ amen preaching is good it catches
[36:10] you in your
[36:11] mistakes but after the preaching catches
[36:15] you you need a
[36:17] teacher after the
[36:19] preaching to shap you in object that God
[36:23] will
[36:25] use and this is what we see to be
[36:28] focused on
[36:30] here in this church amen let's stand up
[36:35] and get into the scripture
[36:37] reading do one thing this
[36:40] morning pray for me and pray for
[36:44] yourself that as the Lord speaks to
[36:47] me he will also speak to you from what
[36:51] he has spoken to
[36:52] me amen so I we get to the Book of
[36:57] Psalms
[36:59] chapter
[37:01] 96 amen but we have a word of prayer
[37:05] first precious Heavenly
[37:08] Father we give thanks and
[37:11] honor for the opportunity to be in your
[37:15] presence father songs of worship have
[37:17] been
[37:19] sung the people have expressed
[37:21] themselves to
[37:23] you they appreciate your
[37:26] love and at the end of it all we all
[37:30] profess Lord that we are standing on
[37:33] good on Holy
[37:34] Ground we pray that you may take from
[37:37] your
[37:38] word and speak to us the words be of
[37:41] eternal
[37:43] life in Jesus name amen amen so uh
[37:49] Psalms
[37:53] 96
[37:56] verse oh Worship the Lord in the beauty
[38:00] of
[38:04] Holiness fear before him on the
[38:11] earth may the Lord that blessing the
[38:13] reading of his
[38:15] word you may be
[38:17] seated so this
[38:20] morning we are going to take
[38:22] time and explore the beauty of holiness
[38:29] so the title this
[38:31] morning the
[38:34] beauty of
[38:36] Holiness and this morning by faith we
[38:40] are standing on a Holy
[38:43] Ground amen
[38:45] teaching as we said is like walking on a
[38:51] th but I pray that the Lord may visit
[38:54] each and every one of us
[38:58] with a special
[39:00] understanding on the subject that we are
[39:03] going to share this
[39:05] morning now Holiness is something that
[39:08] vocabul canot Thor
[39:13] explain because Holiness is only to God
[39:17] and God
[39:20] Alone we cannot make
[39:23] Holiness because Holiness is an
[39:25] attribute
[39:27] that identifies the nature of
[39:31] God so how can you ident I mean explain
[39:35] that Holiness
[39:38] therefore is God's unique
[39:43] characteristic a character that man's
[39:46] Fallen nature cannot
[39:51] hold because it is a condition of
[39:56] character and and then this
[40:00] Holiness is literally different from
[40:06] Perfection and it's different also from
[40:12] sanctification I want to make a
[40:14] statement
[40:15] here that in
[40:18] Holiness there is no
[40:20] repentance because it's all
[40:24] righteousness but in sanctification
[40:28] there is repentance because we make
[40:31] mistakes so holiness is a state that
[40:36] only God
[40:37] has and can
[40:40] hold amen Holiness as our title
[40:46] reads is
[40:48] beautiful and in MTH
[40:51] 5 verse
[40:53] 48 we are called to be perfect
[40:57] as our father is
[40:59] perfect now
[41:02] Perfection is the nearest thing to
[41:08] Holiness but then it is not
[41:12] Holiness because this Perfection
[41:16] here which the Lord is speaking
[41:19] about is not sinless
[41:24] Perfection and since it's not sin
[41:29] Perfection it cannot be the Holiness
[41:32] that god
[41:35] holds because in
[41:37] Holiness which means in
[41:40] God there is no sin and therefore in
[41:45] Holiness there cannot be
[41:48] repentance are you together with me so
[41:51] holiness is something that so
[41:54] deep and it belongs to God and God
[41:59] Alone this Perfection here can be
[42:03] closely related to
[42:07] sanctification amen and
[42:10] sanctification is something you step
[42:13] into and you keep growing
[42:16] in are you together with me you grow in
[42:21] sanctification but Holiness is a
[42:24] step amen which is of
[42:28] god now how can we be
[42:33] holy the only way you can be
[42:36] ho is when the presence of God has come
[42:39] to
[42:40] you are you together with me amen so now
[42:45] Holiness can be to a
[42:48] person as it can be to a
[42:51] place so that means it has nothing to do
[42:55] with your works
[42:57] because you will not say this is Holy
[43:01] Ground because it has not qued this
[43:05] morning no Holiness is a state that God
[43:10] gives which he can place in a
[43:13] person and he can also place in a
[43:17] place listen to
[43:20] brother Mage influence of New
[43:24] York he says it's the presence of God in
[43:27] our midst
[43:30] now that brings
[43:33] Holiness can you say Amen to
[43:35] that not my
[43:38] Holiness not yours but his
[43:43] Holiness his presence is what brings the
[43:48] Holiness we ought to Humble
[43:51] ourselves cover ourselves in
[43:54] reverence humility
[43:57] and say Lord
[43:59] Jesus receive me into your
[44:02] kingdom his Holiness not our Holiness
[44:07] holy
[44:09] spirit amen so
[44:12] holiness is the nature and character of
[44:17] God and if given to
[44:20] man it can only attach to the seed Je
[44:27] which is in the
[44:28] soul which
[44:30] soul is the replica of the holy of
[44:35] holies that's where you would find
[44:38] life that's where you found the sh glory
[44:41] of
[44:43] God it was in the holy of
[44:46] Hol so that
[44:49] Holiness attaching to the
[44:52] SE is a gift of
[44:55] Grace it is God coming in
[44:59] Union not because you
[45:02] Merit but it is the gift of
[45:05] Grace and then you walk in obedience to
[45:08] the
[45:09] word for the sanctification of your
[45:13] spirit are you together with me so
[45:16] brother was teaching about the New
[45:20] Birth the
[45:22] no you are born from
[45:25] above and then God attaches
[45:28] himself to your SE G and after he does
[45:33] that then it causes you to walk in the
[45:38] world and as you walk in the world you
[45:41] are constantly
[45:45] Sanctified amen and as you are
[45:47] constantly being
[45:50] Sanctified you are moving into that
[45:54] Holiness amen which Holiness can only be
[45:59] attributed to
[46:02] us in the entire
[46:05] fullness the change of our
[46:08] body are you together with me amen
[46:12] Holiness is
[46:14] beautiful because it holds the glory of
[46:17] God around
[46:20] it and the glory of
[46:23] God Is So compound
[46:29] it could be SE Divine
[46:32] H div
[46:35] digity
[46:39] magnific the Excellence of
[46:42] God the
[46:44] preeminence so whenever God in his
[46:49] Holiness comes down the glory descends
[46:53] with
[46:54] him and this Glory here
[46:57] is very
[46:59] [Music]
[47:01] commanding amen when you stand in that
[47:04] Glory you don't begin to negotiate with
[47:09] God When you stand in that
[47:12] glory amen it just takes over your
[47:18] dictat amen I will tell you certain
[47:22] things
[47:23] here when that glory of God
[47:27] amen comes down because when God comes
[47:30] down the glory comes with it because the
[47:35] glory and the Holiness is part and Par
[47:39] of
[47:41] God those are Natures of
[47:44] God that you cannot separate from him
[47:48] and he remains
[47:53] God are you together with me yeah you
[47:56] cannot separate those
[47:59] attributes the
[48:01] Holiness and the glory and remains
[48:05] God like you cannot extract oxygen out
[48:09] of
[48:11] water and it remains water are you
[48:14] together with me so when God comes
[48:19] down it pulls even the
[48:24] unconverted to realize that there is a
[48:26] presence of God in the
[48:30] area I will tell you something here that
[48:34] nobody lectured to
[48:37] Saul when the presence of God came
[48:41] down on the road to
[48:44] Damascus because the glory of
[48:48] God brought him down on his
[48:52] knees and he did not ask
[48:55] anybody and he says Lord
[48:57] I mean who is that one he only said
[49:01] Lord that's what the presence
[49:04] does when the presence comes down it
[49:08] establish humility your
[49:11] life it will establish uh you know
[49:15] reverence in your
[49:18] life and it will help
[49:20] you recognize the lordship of
[49:25] God amen that's what the glory of God
[49:29] does when God came down in Ezekiel
[49:34] 1 to meet
[49:37] eel nobody told
[49:39] eel KNE down no he says I fell down as
[49:45] though I was
[49:47] dead and then when he came to
[49:50] Daniel he says I fell down and there was
[49:54] no cess left in me
[49:57] celess means
[50:00] goodness there is nothing which we have
[50:03] done that can stand before God and
[50:07] compare to
[50:09] Holiness are you together with me and
[50:12] when God came down on the is
[50:16] of John says I
[50:21] fa as though I was
[50:23] dead praise God so glory and Holiness
[50:30] Holiness belongs to
[50:31] God and just you know that's what it
[50:35] is and when
[50:37] Ezekiel Saw the visions of
[50:40] God he was blanked in glory god was
[50:44] blanketed in
[50:47] glory which was Amber in
[50:54] brightness amen praise the Lord so let
[50:58] me say this when we come down here in
[51:02] church praise
[51:04] God you must have faith in the
[51:08] blood you must have faith in the
[51:11] blood and you must have faith that the
[51:15] grace of God has saved your
[51:18] soul and therefore when you are coming
[51:21] to
[51:22] church I want you to have one thing at
[51:25] your heart
[51:28] that we are
[51:30] coming into a beauty of
[51:34] Holiness as long as we are coming to
[51:37] meet
[51:38] him and to worship him we are coming the
[51:43] beauty of his
[51:46] Holiness are you together with me praise
[51:49] the Lord so if we Z into
[51:54] prayer with seriousness
[51:58] that's the kind of
[52:01] atmosphere we are stepping
[52:03] into the beauty of
[52:06] Holiness that is surrounded by the glory
[52:09] of
[52:10] God that's why Paul
[52:13] says having the boldness
[52:17] therefore to enter into his
[52:20] presence by the blood of Jesus Christ it
[52:24] takes
[52:25] boldness you live your house when you
[52:27] are
[52:28] pray and you say Lord I'm entering into
[52:32] the Hall of
[52:34] holies it took
[52:36] boldness for the high priest to enter
[52:39] into the holy of
[52:41] holies amen they were even tying a rope
[52:44] on his
[52:46] leg because he was entering into a holy
[52:49] place and if he died there no man has
[52:54] the right to enter in there
[52:56] just pull the
[52:58] rock so when this high priest entered
[53:01] there it was
[53:03] boldness is it boldness for you this
[53:07] morning to come into the beauty of
[53:10] Holiness and be able toship
[53:13] him we thank God that we have got
[53:17] something that we can actually attach
[53:21] our boldness
[53:23] to the blood of Jesus
[53:27] hallelujah hallelujah to enter into the
[53:30] holiest by the blood of Jesus so
[53:34] holiness is a state of
[53:37] being that we shall only fully
[53:41] behold when we step into it according to
[53:46] First
[53:47] John 3 verse
[53:50] 2 when he shall
[53:52] appear we shall be like him
[53:57] hallelujah hallelujah that's when we can
[54:01] testify about the beauty of
[54:04] Holiness Hallelujah hallu because you
[54:08] will be as
[54:10] he Hallelujah the
[54:14] interpretation will be the change of
[54:16] your
[54:17] body for you to understand the
[54:19] Holiness is when you step into that body
[54:24] change but we believe one
[54:27] thing that we come from Christ and we
[54:31] are going into
[54:32] Christ and if the root be
[54:35] holy then so are the branches
[54:39] holy we are depending on him so holiness
[54:44] is God's own life in
[54:50] you amen let's go to Ephesians chapter
[54:54] one amen
[54:57] verse
[54:58] three blessed be the God and father of
[55:03] our Lord Jesus
[55:07] Christ who has blessed us with all
[55:11] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[55:14] in

[55:23] him before the foundation of the world
[55:29] that we should be
[55:34] holy and Without
[55:36] Blame before him in
[55:38] love so you are blessed with those
[55:42] spiritual
[55:44] blessings in Heavenly
[55:46] places in Christ
[55:49] Jesus you are chosen to be holy you are
[55:55] chosen
[55:56] to come into the
[55:58] sture and nature of God
[56:02] himself to come into the
[56:04] character and nature which language
[56:08] cannot
[56:10] explain hallelujah hallelujah that's
[56:13] what we are called
[56:15] for
[56:17] amen if the root is
[56:21] Holy if the root is Holy
[56:26] also
[56:28] be but in the fullness of
[56:32] adoption amen when we have been adopted
[56:37] to W the change of our
[56:40] body amen but right

[57:04] putting the
[57:06] nature and the character of your human
[57:11] Spirit under the

[57:17] yourself because as you sanctify
[57:21] your the seed chin On th
[57:24] side keeps growing
[57:27] and growing and growing into the
[57:30] character of Christ
[57:32] himself praise the Lord amen so second
[57:36] Peter
[57:38] 1 and
[57:41] verse he says whereby are given unto us
[57:47] exceeding great and precious
[57:54] promises that by these promises you

[59:40] Mount of
[59:42] transformation Peter called it a holy
[59:47] M and he had demanded to build the three
[59:52] Tabernacles are you together with me so

[1:06:03] spirits to sing until you sing the TRS
[1:06:07] away from the hearts of the
[1:06:12] people Amen in the days of
[1:06:15] Moses the Bea of
[1:06:18] Holiness was in the holy of
[1:06:20] holies where the high priest was allowed
[1:06:25] to enter
[1:06:28] once on of the
[1:06:33] people not everybody could enter
[1:06:36] there he entered their on behalf of the
[1:06:41] people telling the people that you have
[1:06:45] the
[1:06:47] access to enter into the
[1:06:51] Hest but I'm entering there on your
[1:06:54] behalf
[1:06:56] to do a
[1:06:58] service for the atonement of your
[1:07:03] SE that's where the Holiness
[1:07:06] was that was where the throne
[1:07:09] was and brother Bram
[1:07:12] say and a man or a
[1:07:15] woman that ever walked into that
[1:07:20] sh the whole world was shut
[1:07:24] behind why
[1:07:26] because in there there was a golden
[1:07:30] sensor no
[1:07:35] aenor which was golden
[1:07:39] in they would put the incense in
[1:07:43] there and now the high priest will go in
[1:07:46] there and swing that golden
[1:07:51] in and this sensor here
[1:07:56] was an instrument of
[1:07:59] worship that was only used in
[1:08:03] worship on the day of
[1:08:06] atonement the high priest kept
[1:08:10] waving
[1:08:13] the and as the sensors were smoking out
[1:08:16] of
[1:08:19] there he was like presenting the prayers
[1:08:23] of the people
[1:08:26] as the smoke went up the prayers were
[1:08:29] going up to
[1:08:31] God and then brought it back again like
[1:08:35] he was stretching more
[1:08:37] prayers and then waving them and was
[1:08:40] sending more prayers for the people so
[1:08:44] the high priest was doing this only once
[1:08:48] a
[1:08:49] day on the day of
[1:08:51] atonment in Revelation 8 it
[1:08:56] signifies the ascending of the prayers
[1:08:58] of the
[1:09:00] Saints I'm talking about in that
[1:09:04] presence in there was an AR of the
[1:09:09] Covenant over with
[1:09:12] go speaking with Humanity of
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:19] Christ amen required
[1:09:22] God to become a man in order for him to
[1:09:27] atone for our
[1:09:29] sin with the same
[1:09:32] AR was golden
[1:09:37] P of which had
[1:09:40] man and in there there was also aon's
[1:09:46] Ro which
[1:09:50] bed and the tables of the Covenant
[1:09:55] and over the Ark of the
[1:09:57] Covenant was the chab beams of
[1:10:02] Glory who were overshadowing the The
[1:10:06] Throne of
[1:10:09] God are you together with me I'm trying
[1:10:12] to
[1:10:13] explain what God has placed on the
[1:10:16] inside of
[1:10:18] you are you together with me yes and he
[1:10:22] deposit in the holy of holies
[1:10:26] and in there the devil is not supposed
[1:10:30] to reach
[1:10:31] there hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:10:35] in the high
[1:10:37] priest who could reach there and today
[1:10:42] Christ is the high priest of our
[1:10:45] confession are you together with me he's
[1:10:48] the only one who goes in there and when
[1:10:51] he goes on the side there that that
[1:10:54] means that he has got into I mean that
[1:10:57] he has brought in there the presence of
[1:11:02] God the beauty of
[1:11:04] Holiness are you together with me and
[1:11:07] that
[1:11:08] means in there he receiving your
[1:11:12] prayers and it also means that in there
[1:11:17] there is the living
[1:11:19] manner that never gets
[1:11:22] stale that in there there's the Mery
[1:11:26] sins of the Forgiveness of sins when the
[1:11:30] holy of
[1:11:31] holies is open to the

[1:33:55] matters that's why the most obligated
[1:34:01] people are the people who prepare for
[1:34:05] the coming in of the
[1:34:11] Ark they were very
[1:34:13] necessary David prepared
[1:34:16] them he
[1:34:19] said you are going to be
[1:34:22] for amen so that you may prepare the
[1:34:26] hearts of the

[1:35:33] River Wood River river yeah River where
[1:35:38] there wasn't even a person
[1:35:42] left they just piled up
[1:35:49] crutches and wheel
[1:35:52] chairs and
[1:35:55] I was standing at the
[1:35:57] platform preaching like this and they
[1:36:01] just begin T
[1:36:03] up throwing them to the
[1:36:06] corners
[1:36:07] atmosphere was
[1:36:10] right the
[1:36:13] tradition I wait for the pastor to
[1:36:17] finish then I'll go in the line then
[1:36:20] it's going to touch me
[1:36:26] no just watch the
[1:36:29] atmosphere and Lord I think for me the
[1:36:34] atmosphere to this
[1:36:36] point is
[1:36:39] right and you step in and you surpass
[1:36:45] me you see the angel as the
[1:36:50] waters and according to the connection
[1:36:54] between you and the flow of the Holy
[1:36:57] Spirit you feel that this trouble in his
[1:37:02] mind amen the traveling of the
[1:37:05] water at the 50th
[1:37:09] me is mine stepping there going with
[1:37:15] Fai and say Lord I receive
[1:37:22] it huh are you together with me this
[1:37:26] atmosphere is for the seed
[1:37:30] gen in the soul you can you can lay a
[1:37:34] seed out there in the
[1:37:37] ground no
[1:37:40] matter how much that seed is
[1:37:44] dramatized and lay it there it's going
[1:37:48] to have an
[1:37:49] atmosphere for it to come alive
[1:37:54] atmosphere is that
[1:37:57] presence he says the son has to
[1:38:01] come to a certain
[1:38:03] power before bring it to a certain
[1:38:09] atmosphere to have an
[1:38:11] atmosphere an
[1:38:15] egg only to want
[1:38:18] out no matter how fertile it is it's
[1:38:22] going to have an atmosphere
[1:38:28] praise the
[1:38:30] Lord do you love
[1:38:34] him there must be an
[1:38:39] atmosphere I say something about
[1:38:43] sanctification and
[1:38:46] Hol you know this luganda
[1:38:51] Bibles they don't have the word word
[1:38:55] of
[1:38:58] Holiness
[1:39:01] Perfection
[1:39:02] Holiness it lamps it
[1:39:07] together they are
[1:39:11] Clos but
[1:39:14] not
[1:39:17] sanctification is something that we grow
[1:39:21] into but holiness
[1:39:24] is the state of God
[1:39:27] himself which we can
[1:39:31] partake by maintaining the
[1:39:38] presence so
[1:39:40] sanctification you
[1:39:43] grow every day you have something to
[1:39:47] take under the
[1:39:48] blood that's
[1:39:51] sanctification but then
[1:39:55] is the state of
[1:39:56] God which you can never get
[1:40:00] into unless you maintain
[1:40:05] sanctification are you together with me
[1:40:09] yeah
[1:40:12] so but the
[1:40:14] problem is that our
[1:40:17] emotions keeps leaking away the
[1:40:21] present leing leaking
[1:40:27] amen you
[1:40:29] have but
[1:40:32] something now when I say you have a
[1:40:35] Holiness you must understand what I
[1:40:38] mean you are maintaining a
[1:40:41] presence but all of a
[1:40:44] sudden something comes and punctures
[1:40:48] that Hol
[1:40:54] then it begins to
[1:41:01] leak and then that atmosphere begins to
[1:41:08] leak you
[1:41:11] lie and
[1:41:12] that you know attribute begins to
[1:41:17] leak last for
[1:41:20] women then it begins to leak
[1:41:23] last for
[1:41:26] money and then it begins to
[1:41:29] leak but the only pres time I mean the
[1:41:32] only way we can maintain the
[1:41:35] presence is by
[1:41:37] Prayer by
[1:41:39] study and meditation of the
[1:41:44] word when you step into that
[1:41:47] presence and you really
[1:41:51] know then you try your your
[1:41:55] best to maintain that
[1:41:57] presence keep your life in

[1:42:04] study and also meditate on the
[1:42:09] word you see
[1:42:12] Holiness and
[1:42:14] Glory goes
[1:42:18] together but
[1:42:20] sometimes our human nature
[1:42:25] to
[1:42:29] out
[1:42:31] fear causes it to Le
[1:42:35] out you remember the glory of
[1:42:38] God with the light on
[1:42:42] mam but then when the message came from
[1:42:47] Jezebel the
[1:42:49] fear licked out the glory
[1:42:55] Elijah began to
[1:42:57] wonder you mean this
[1:43:00] woman is coming to kill me and Elijah
[1:43:06] read like

[1:45:45] preaching on
[1:45:48] churches our church brother when you get
[1:45:51] into our church there's nothing like
[1:45:56] that brother Bram
[1:45:59] says it is a holy
[1:46:02] God not a holy
[1:46:04] man it's the Holy
[1:46:06] Ghost Peter one time referred the holy
[1:46:11] M on M
[1:46:14] Transfiguration it wasn't the mountain
[1:46:16] that was
[1:46:18] Ho it was the holy God that made them on
[1:46:23] this
[1:46:24] mountain it's not the holy church it's
[1:46:28] the holy God in that church not the holy
[1:46:33] man but the Holy Spirit working in that
[1:46:38] man are you together with me so once you
[1:46:41] also feels the beauty of
[1:46:45] Holiness step into those moments and
[1:46:49] worship sing songs of
[1:46:51] worship claim some form of
[1:46:55] promise even if you are
[1:46:57] driving amen I sometimes stop my
[1:47:01] car if I can't stop my
[1:47:04] car bring out my phone and
[1:47:09] record what the holy spirit is moving in
[1:47:11] my
[1:47:15] mouth and I meditate on
[1:47:20] it praise the Lord
[1:47:23] if you feel like the exaltation has
[1:47:26] blessed
[1:47:29] you you have got a
[1:47:31] friend call him and fellowship about
[1:47:35] that we have to maintain the beauty of
[1:47:43] Holiness amen oh I am so
[1:47:47] glad that my Holiness is not of myself
[1:47:53] Bram says I am glad that I am in
[1:47:56] Christ with all his wonderful
[1:48:00] attributes of righteousness
[1:48:03] imputed imparted down to
[1:48:08] me
[1:48:09] Holiness
[1:48:12] sanctification so let's talk about
[1:48:14] sanctification
[1:48:17] here now I know one must live a
[1:48:21] Sanctified life
[1:48:24] and Sanctified
[1:48:26] life is a constant submission to the
[1:48:30] world that
[1:48:34] sanctification there cannot be
[1:48:37] sanctification if
[1:48:39] you the
[1:48:43] ex because it's committed to the
[1:48:48] word you are trying the best you
[1:48:51] can to m the beaut of
[1:48:55] Holiness that's what the Holy Ghost led
[1:48:57] me to
[1:48:59] do that let me participate with my
[1:49:03] brethren and you do not know what it
[1:49:07] takes some of the
[1:49:09] preachers even from
[1:49:11] overseas they tell me you've got such a
[1:49:17] patience all the ministers here know
[1:49:21] that you see if you do that for a few
[1:49:24] days you begin to say
[1:49:32] nons Amen but when the Holy Ghost is
[1:49:36] maintaining
[1:49:38] something let us try the best we
[1:49:41] can to maintain the beauty of
[1:49:45] Holiness amen amen oh hallelujah oh
[1:49:50] Hallelujah you know sanctification is
[1:49:52] mission to the
[1:49:55] word and this submission I mean this
[1:50:00] submission separates you from the
[1:50:03] world because the word doesn't tell you
[1:50:07] go to the
[1:50:08] Disco it will be telling you stay away
[1:50:11] from the
[1:50:13] disc and then as long as you keep
[1:50:15] obeying the
[1:50:17] word dress right amen you the words you
[1:50:23] dress right it will keep away from Bad
[1:50:30] Company because the word can't tell you
[1:50:32] to go into Bad
[1:50:35] Company it keeps you away from the night
[1:50:40] Sports keep your lips
[1:50:43] clean amen so that you may not get it to
[1:50:46] condition of
[1:50:48] Isaiah a man who stays in the midst of
[1:50:52] man with unlean
[1:50:58] lips that is
[1:51:00] sanctification you cannot be in the word
[1:51:03] without being
[1:51:04] Sanctified because he says sanctify them
[1:51:07] with thy
[1:51:09] truth the word is
[1:51:11] trth so
[1:51:13] sanctification helps you to keep
[1:51:16] walking in such a life that attracts the
[1:51:20] Holiness of God
[1:51:26] are you together with me yeah so I think
[1:51:30] I car
[1:51:32] subject on
[1:51:34] sanctification Holiness and Perfection
[1:51:38] they seem to be
[1:51:39] connected but there are three totally
[1:51:41] different
[1:51:45] things you see so in another way of
[1:51:48] looking at
[1:51:50] it sanctification
[1:51:54] before
[1:52:00] you the
[1:52:02] atmosphere of
[1:52:04] Holiness amen word
[1:52:09] sanctification word sanctification is a
[1:52:13] characteristic of
[1:52:16] Holiness and that's why when some of our
[1:52:20] people get that good feeling of
[1:52:25] sanctification they may confuse
[1:52:27] it with the BM of the Holy
[1:52:32] Ghost they come to the
[1:52:34] Altar and shout and cry and beat the
[1:52:39] altar but you see the holy spirit is
[1:52:43] pointing his life
[1:52:45] away into
[1:52:47] sanctification you Hur the past you
[1:52:50] begin to cry people call it the Holy
[1:53:01] Ghost praise the Lord do you love him
[1:53:05] this
[1:53:06] morning amen once yourself feels the
[1:53:09] beauty of
[1:53:11] Holiness step into it and
[1:53:16] worship sing
[1:53:19] songs do something there
[1:53:23] Lord I need you at this
[1:53:25] time father do something for me Lord God
[1:53:31] whether you are
[1:53:32] driving whether you are
[1:53:35] walking God in your
[1:53:39] heart because you are meditating on the
[1:53:42] word and you cross
[1:53:45] something oh thank you Jesus praise God
[1:53:50] oh Heavenly Father possess
[1:53:53] that my heavenly father I want to give
[1:53:56] thanks to you I want to give you the
[1:53:59] glory whether you were in class whether
[1:54:02] you were at work whether you on the road
[1:54:05] you don't have to shout
[1:54:13] out sometimes you are in an
[1:54:16] examination and then something crosses
[1:54:19] your
[1:54:20] mind and then hallelujah
[1:54:24] [Laughter]
[1:54:27] hallelujah you see they are going to get
[1:54:32] confused praise the Lord amen you know
[1:54:36] those things that come to your
[1:54:38] mind as long as it's the word of
[1:54:41] God is God communing with
[1:54:44] you never bypass
[1:54:49] them let's look at Isaiah
[1:54:53] in the beauty of
[1:54:56] Holiness in the beauty of
[1:54:59] Holiness is
[1:55:01] realized that he needs to
[1:55:04] grow in the areas of his
[1:55:09] sanctification he cried
[1:55:12] saying
[1:55:14] me for I am
[1:55:17] done because I am a man of unlean lips
[1:55:23] I dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:55:24] unclean
[1:55:26] lives for my eyes have seen the
[1:55:29] king the Lord of
[1:55:31] H he realized his
[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:55:38] weakness the
[1:55:40] beauty of Holiness the beauty of his Hol
[1:55:45] of his
[1:55:47] presence it doesn't wait for you to come
[1:55:49] into church
[1:55:52] can feel the
[1:55:54] presence as you are walking brother Bram
[1:55:57] could feel the
[1:55:59] presence when he's on hunting
[1:56:02] trips and then he says Lord is there
[1:56:05] something you want to say to your
[1:56:11] Serv are you together with me since that
[1:56:16] presence and when you say that
[1:56:20] Holiness then anything passing
[1:56:23] by say some words of
[1:56:27] pray amen and Isaiah was saying
[1:56:32] that then FW the
[1:56:36] him having a call in his
[1:56:40] hand which he had taken with a tongue
[1:56:42] from The
[1:56:44] Altar and La it upon his mouth and
[1:56:48] said L this has touched thy lips
[1:56:52] and your iniquity has been taken
[1:56:55] away and your sin is
[1:56:58] bur the beauty of
[1:57:01] Holiness and in there
[1:57:05] Isaiah learn how to
[1:57:10] worship are you together with me he
[1:57:13] keeps throwing away everything I think
[1:57:16] this is not good for me what are you
[1:57:19] throwing away in this service today
[1:57:22] I know the holy spirit is passing your
[1:57:25] away what are you throwing away what you
[1:57:28] allow the seraphim
[1:57:30] come with the Call of fire he knows what
[1:57:35] areas to pass the call of fire to
[1:57:38] cleanse you and make you perfect that
[1:57:41] you may always
[1:57:43] stand in his presence in this beauty of
[1:57:48] Holiness oh Isaiah learned how to
[1:57:51] worship
[1:57:52] he knew what he
[1:57:54] needed while stepping into that pres he
[1:57:58] saw the Holy
[1:58:00] Angels hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:58:04] he comes to church and his eyes are all
[1:58:07] over the
[1:58:08] place his ears are all over the
[1:58:11] place but some people come to
[1:58:14] church and they are not here but Isaiah
[1:58:18] was there and he was able to recogize
[1:58:23] how those men the Angels who had never
[1:58:27] seen were treating themselves before
[1:58:30] the amen you come down to church we
[1:58:34] don't copy from one another but there
[1:58:37] will be certain things which brother so
[1:58:40] and so does when is in the house of the
[1:58:43] Lord and you are going to learn from
[1:58:46] that hey I mean Isaiah was learning from
[1:58:51] the serapi
[1:58:53] praise God Amen they had never sined
[1:58:58] before but they covered their
[1:59:01] faes

[1:59:07] is to be rever in the house of
[1:59:11] God are you together with me they keep
[1:59:16] reverence he saw them cover their
[1:59:20] feet in humility
[1:59:23] and they saw how they flew
[1:59:26] around in action going around shouting
[1:59:31] holy holy Lord God
[1:59:34] Almighty prise God Amen you need to get
[1:59:39] in here and you say teach me out to
[1:59:42] worship and you allow the Holy Spirit to
[1:59:46] teach you humility you allow the Holy
[1:59:49] Spirit to teach you reverence you allow
[1:59:52] the Holy Ghost to help you get into
[1:59:57] service amen praise God there is a level
[2:00:01] of
[2:00:02] sanctification we need to raise in the
[2:00:06] Heavenly
[2:00:08] places in Christ
[2:00:14] Jesus you come into the presence of God
[2:00:18] you are ready to Lear
[2:00:24] praise
[2:00:25] God there's a level of sanctification we
[2:00:29] need let's go to Ephesians
[2:00:32] 2 this is very
[2:00:41] interesting he says in verse
[2:00:46] 4 but God who is rich in Mercy
[2:00:53] for this for his great love where with
[2:00:56] he loved
[2:00:59] us even when we were dead in
[2:01:06] sin he has quickened
[2:01:09] us together with
[2:01:11] Christ by
[2:01:13] Grace you are saved and has raised us up
[2:01:18] together

[2:01:41] this no
[2:01:45] the where the glory of God goes
[2:01:49] to by the B of the Holy Ghost

[2:01:56] Redemption puts the
[2:01:58] church into Heavenly
[2:02:01] places in Christ Jesus and that is a
[2:02:05] spiritual
[2:02:07] Dimension where the
[2:02:10] blessings of the believer are
[2:02:15] hidden your
[2:02:17] blessings are hidden in a dimension
[2:02:22] so you allow the Holy Spirit to come

[2:02:26] life Lift Your Inner
[2:02:29] Man Heavenly
[2:02:31] places in Christ Jesus where your
