with him praise the name of our Lord and then the weekend I'll be in this weekend I'll be in bar so you just keep us in prayers and we appreciate all the Brethren who are in the [Music] Army you know in the days of John when he was preaching the Bible says different categories of people came to him came to him and the publicans came to him then the sers also came to him the publicans came what shall we do and then he told them don't ex more than what is meant to be you know the people who Tak taxes can cheat you so he say don't do that when they said came that's what shall we do then he told them don't do violence to anybody don't falsely atuse and be content with your wages but when the priests came they didn't ask him what shall we do they asked him who are you praise the name of so you see the priest missed salvation they even asked Jesus who gave you that Authority praise the name of our Lord so we thank God that he has Witnesses everywhere amen and then I remember in the times of Jesus Christ there was a centurion and the Bible says he was a faithful man he had built a lot of syag you know many places and then he had a sodia under him who was sick and he felt he's not worthy to meet Christ so he sent one of the Jews to pray for the servant and then he told the Jew go tell Jesus that me I'm not worthy but Christ is under Authority he can command anything and happens and then the Lord said there is no great faith like that then in Acts chapter 10 there was also another sodia a centurion and then he was called Cornelius God-fearing person he would give his arms to people and he was praying and fasting about three days and then the angel came and visited praise the name of the Lord and then our brothers here and sister You' had their leftenant Kel majors and captains and they are more than a centurion praise the name of our so we are happy that God has saved you and you are serving him in those places you also send our greetings to the Brethren who are in those different places and we pray that God blesses you in your place of work and you may be witnesses to others also praise the name of our Lord our pastor is not around today he went to campala for a converstion there's a youth convention I think is in he's not going to preach but he felt he needed to attend but then we want also to appreciate those who came for the meetings in blang on Friday we appreciate that actually these periods have been very busy for all of us preached on Friday to Services yesterday was which is beyond preaching today I going TOA then I was also in C for 3 Days on Thursday Friday and Saturday so you find that there a lot of work to do and that's why we need to challenge our young brothers and sisters to really be serious and come to the task praise the name of our Lord say that you become involved in the work be involved in these missions sometimes you know you drive a long distance when you're alone in the car and then now you start wondering whom can you move with praise the name of our Lord but these are opportunities to move with you that you learn what happens there you know such that you can be involved because this is how it goes on praise the name of so really encourage the young people to be serious don't absent yourself from ch praise the name of our Lord you know when you don't come to church the first responsibility then we find you're not serious so if you can't come to church to attend the services which are there then how will be involved in the things which take more commitment praise the name of our Lord so you need to be serious with the work of the Lord and then you see how the Lord can help you and then you see how God can lift you up praise the name of the Lord we have sister she can stand up you're welcome our young sister somebody witnessed to her and then directed that to me and so on Wednesday we want to baptize in the water in the name of Jesus Christ so thank you so much you're always welcome winning you may sit down then we are also having Pastor welcome if you can stand up he Pastor a church Ino so we appreciate your presence with us are there other people coming here for the first time if you can just raise up your hand I believe we have been to introduce all we also want to appreciate those who went yesterday for the introduction in I'm told they came back at around either almost in the morning at 4: or 3 in the morning but we appreciate you for standing with our brother Peter praise the name of our Lord and then this Saturday we shall have his wedding here at even the reception here so we call upon you to support your contribution and then put putting this place tight enough praise the name of our and then I have my young brother there if you can stand up so you are welcome last Sunday was with us here and I was asking him if he's serious to be coming here so you're always welcome Cesar amen so again on Sunday next week we are going to have a youth meeting in the afternoon praise the name of our Lord and brother William will be handling that praise the name of our Amen Let Us stand up and take a scripture reading we go to John chapter 20 John 20 verse 21 up to verse 23 the Bible says then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whoever you remit they are remitted unto them and soever since you retain they are retained let us pray father we bless your holy name and thank you for the reading of the scriptures we appreciate for what you doing in our midst we give praise and honor to your name and now we pray Heavenly Father May the Holy Spirit come down and break to us this word of eternal life everyone of us individually to know in the power of your resurrection and to be certain of where we are standing bless every one of us in such a SP in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated so I want to take some bit of time I don't know how long I will take but I request you bear with me for two hours I want to preach on the subject receiving the Holy Ghost praise the name of our Lord receiving the Holy Ghost now the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says you know he met his disciples and then he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now in the message questions and answers you can go to slide number three there's some slides I sent brother Joshua if you can follow that up I would request you go to my notes and put them directly because we are going to have a lot of things to read so in the message questions and slide number three slide number three he says under questions and answers they were asking brother Bram said dear brother Bram what is the difference when Jesus breathed on the disciples and said receive ye the Holy Ghost and when they had to go to the upper room to T then he says it was a promise he gave unto them breathed on them his promise said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a promise they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled the same thing is when we lay hands upon you to be healed then you go on about your business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled now so somebody was asking him the question what was that what was that difference you know when he breathed on on them receive the Holy Ghost and then when they were waiting in the upper room then he says it was a promise and then we see that in the book of Acts chapter one and then verse four he says I send you the promise of my father praise the name of the Lord so when we go to Acts chapter one and then verse four he says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which says he you have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days h so now you see that the Lord himself giving the promise of the baptism of the Holy Spirit now when we go to the Book of Luke and then we read in Luke 3 and then verse 16 John answered saying unto them all I indeed baptize you with water but one come the latet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize with the Holy Ghost with and fire so now John say what I can do is I baptize you with water and as a minister we can also do the same like our young sister winie to be baptized here on wedes day in the name of Jesus Christ any person can baptize you that way but only God who can baptize you with the Holy Spirit and being baptized with the Holy Spirit is the new birth being baptized with the holy spirit is being born from Heaven praise the name of our Lord because Jesus told Nicodemus that unless a man is born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of God and that word again you know the original translation was above in other words unless a man is born from above unless a man is born from heaven like John chapter 3 and then we can pick that up there the Bible says John chapter 3 and then we go to to verse Jesus answered very very I say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again so our first birth is the birth we get from our parents our mothers our fathers gave birth to our first gave birth to this bodies praise the name of our Lord that was our first bus and our first bus comes from the first Adam praise the name of our Lord we are all descendants of Adam by the first birth but now the birth of the first bir the Bible says in Psalms chapter 51 Psalms 51 and then verse 5 it says behold I was Sheed in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive meise the name of so our first bir the Bible says we were actually shapen in iniquity and in sin did our parents conceive us so in other words the original plan of God is not the way we come here on us our first birth makes us blind to the things of God our first makes us enemies of God like say for example you may have a little child at home and then the child goes and starts saking sugar and now when you meet the child you ask the child who has given you this sugar so I've not taken any sugar and then trying to wipe the mouth it is a nature of sin we are born with that is our first birth that's the birth from Adam and Adam was a fallen man praise the name of the Lord so he fell then he produced so he produced every person after his Fallen nature praise the name of the Lord you don't need somebody to tell you that you're going to die because death lives with you as long as you are born death follows you because that's the nature we are born with you get a little child dying when you're dying at any age somebody's dying why because of our F who were born in sin and shaped in iniquity that's why God had to put on flesh and come as the Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord you know God he manifests himself as the father as the son as the Holy Ghost the same God the Old Testament he showed himself as the father praise the name of our Lord and father God above us and now in the Old Testament you remember when he was giving the law in Exodus until it was so fearful to reach that mount he told them put boundaries around and said if the animal crosses those boundaries it should be killed and then even Moses said himself I feared that was how God was as a father but now he desire to redeem us so the only way he could redeem us was for God himself to get a body and that body he got we called it Emmanuel God With Us he was not the second God but it was the same God who was above he put on a body we called him Jesus Christ and then he was God With Us Praise the name of our Lord he was God With Us and now Jesus Christ in that body the Bible says in Hebrews 31 he was the expression of the invisible God because the invisible God is a spirit you can't touch a spirit you can't see a spirit so that Spirit of the invisible God put on a body called Jesus Christ and then he was born Among Us now you look at it this way the first law the first commandment and the second commandment says you shall not have other gods beside me and you shall not worship them but now you look at the wise men old men and then they came to bethleem and they bought down and they worshiped baby Jesus if they were contrast the law God would not have warned them to go and tell her what they have seen so you see it is God Who Came In the Flesh and dwelt amongst us praise the name of our Lord John chapter 1 and then verse 14 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word became flesh that was our Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was not the second God Jesus Christ is not the second person of the Trinity but Jesus Christ is the only person of God praise the name of Lord he was the manifestation of the Living God but now Jesus in his form here on us he says it's better for me that I go away but when I go away I will send you a comforter praise the name of the spirit of Truth let us go to John chapter 14 praise the name of our Lord John chapter 14 and then we start from verse 16 it says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knows him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so he says God is the father is going to send another comforter what was he meaning I'm coming in another form and the comforter is talking about is the spirit of Truth in other words the spirit of God the spirit of Christ the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost it is the same thing and then he says he dwells with you who was with them it was Christ so he says now I'm going to put off this body and then come in the form of the Holy Spirit and then he says the world cannot receive him the world cannot see him and the world cannot know him now what is that world which cannot receive the Holy Spirit which cannot see the Holy Spirit which cannot know the Holy Spirit when we got to the book of First John praise the name of our Lord first John chapter 2 and then we start from verse 15 the scripture says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him 1 John 2 verse [Music] 15 praise the name of our Lord so he says love not the world nether the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him then he explains the world is talking about for all the world for all that is in the world then he names it the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world so now if you have the lust of the flesh you have the lust of the ey you have the pride of life that is the world and he says that world you have the last of the flesh the last of the eye the pride of life cannot receive the holy spirit that one you have cannot see the holy spirit that world you have cannot know the holy spirit so now if we want to receive the Holy Spirit then we need to get rid of that world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life so if you don't get R of that word you cannot receive the true baptism of the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord because we are talking about being born again and being born again is receiving the holy spirit from God himself being born again is receiving the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord receiving the life of Jesus Christ is being born again is being born of God is the new birth becoming a new creation praise the name of our Lord so now the Lord Jesus told them unless I go away if I don't go away the comforter will not come praise the name of our Lord it says he will not come so when we go to John chapter 7 and then verse 37 praise the name of our Lord today I'm going to be quite faster praise the name of our Lord because I have a lot which I feel we need to reach to praise the name of our Lord I want you to adjust praise the name of Lord we shall be moving in different direction so John 7 verse 37 in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying in a man thirst let him come unto me and drink and he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water and then the scripture says in verse 39 but this spoke he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so you see that the Holy Spirit was given after Christ was glorified the Holy Spirit had to come down to us after the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord that's where the Holy Ghost had to come to us and you know that in the scriptures the Bible says they saw that sinness shall die but now God didn't leave us in that kind of condition so he put there an atonement in lus chter 17 and then verse 11 praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says in Leviticus 1711 for the of the flesh is in in the blood and I have given it unto you upon the altar to make an atonment for your souls for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul praise the name of the Lord now I want you to go to the church I gave you the slides praise the name of the Lord I want to go to slide number 26 praise the name of the Lord so now in luganda the soul is calling it but the soul okay okay you've got it right let us go to first Thessalonians chapter 5 we going to come back to lus chapter 17 I want to use the scriptures to explain scriptures now first Thessalonians chapter 5 and then verse 23 he says and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray that God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless un the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ 5 Leviticus 5: 23 23 now in first Thessalonians 5 verse 23 show that scripture praise the name of our Lord today I want the people controlling to be FAS I'm fast first Thessalonians chapter 5 and then verse 23 now so you see here the Bible says and I pray that your whole Spirit that's now the human spirit and then he says the soul and then the body so as a human being you have the body praise the name of our Lord then inside the body there is the human spirit and then inside the human Spirit there is the soul praise the name of our Lord there is the soul praise the name of our Lord you know the devil doesn't want us to follow this praise the name of our Lord now I want to demonstrate it praise the name of the Lord I want you to follow me what is this you respond you know to be saved to be saved you have to confess I want you to confess so what is this who hand you raise also your hand so what is this who hand what is this whose head what is this whose hand so what is this whose head what is this whose hand so where are you praise the name of the Lord because if I say what is this phone whose phone mine then I say what is this hand whose hand so where are you are you the hand are you the head or are you the body praise the name of Lord so this body here is like a house you yourself are inside that praise the name of our Lord so when you die they said the B of so and so you have already left so now the Bible is telling us that may God sanctify your whole body which our parents gave birth to but the parents giving birth to the body is not a whole human being because others give birth to bodies and still birth so at the birth God releases the human Spirit and the human spirit is the one that gives this body life the one the Bible says the body without the spirit is dead so we have these bodies but there is a human spirit that moves this body but then in that human Spirit there is a soul and that soul is what God is interested in but then he's saying let God sanctify your whole body your whole spirit and your whole soul praise the name of our Lord but then in the scriptures let us go to Genesis praise the name of our Lord we go to Genesis and then we read in chapter two Genesis chapter 2 and and then we read in verse 7 and the Lord formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into him his noes the breath of life and Man became a living Soul so he saying a living soul praise the name of our Lord and then when we go to Ezekiel chapter 18 and then verse 20 the scripture says the soul that sinth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteous of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him now he says the soul that sin now it is the soul that God is more interested in praise the name of our Lord it is the soul which is the source of life that's where God's interest is that's why God can make this body suffer for the Salvation of the Soul because that is his interest God can take this body away from us or die because of the Soul that is the interest of God not so much how the body is feeling good not so much how the body is looking not so much how the body has achieved this and this but it is the soul which is the interest of God now when we go back to Leviticus 17 and then verse 11 the Bible says for the life of the flesh is in the blood and have given it un you upon the altar to make an atonement for your soul for it is the blood that makes an atonement the soul is not talking about atonement for the body he not talking about the atonement of the spirit but he talking about the atonement of the Soul because that's where sin came from and it is in the S where sin lays it is in the soul where unbelief lays so now God had to bring an atonment to see that sin in the soul is gotten rid of and then he says I have put blood upon the altar to make an atonement for praise the name of our living so now he says the life of the body the life of the flesh is in the blood that's why Jesus Christ had to come in this body that's why Jesus Christ had to get a human body because it is the human body that could produce blood and now the blood of Jesus made atonment for our souls praise the name of our Lord and you know like somebody when they get an accident they have to rush them to the hospital or to make them stop bleeding otherwise if they bleed and the blood is over they die why because life of the flesh is in the blood so now he uses the the blood of animals in the Old Testament to make atonement but now the blood of the animals will not re remove the human life the human s because animal life could not come to human life animal life is lower than human life so now God himself had to put on a body and when he put on a body he came and shed his own blood praise the name of our Lord no wonder what the Bible says in Acts 20 and then verse 28 the Bible says take heed therefore to yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood so the Bible says we are purchased by the blood of God we are not purchased by the blood of a Jew we are not purchased by the blood of a person but we are purchased by the blood of God himself and so the blood of God had life what was the life in the blood of God the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord so the Holy Spirit was the life in the blood of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit was the life in the blood of God so now when he died he released that life praise the name of our Lord so now in John 7 and verse 39 the Bible says but this Spokey of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet gr praise the name of our Lord so now when Jesus died that's when he released his life that's when he released the holy spirit so then on the day of Pentecost the life of Jesus Christ which is the holy spirit comes down to the church comes down to the Believers praise the name of our Lord so he says they he spoke of the Holy Spirit which they that believe on him should receive now the thing is when Jesus died he released the Holy Spirit praise the name of our like if he says I've given you praise the name of the Lord like if I come and give brother cus the phone what does he do what do you do now this one is interesting he starts pressing it with me it doesn't instead receive it or take it so when they give you what do you do you receive praise the name of our Lord you receive what is given to you now he has said receive you the Holy Ghost do you do you receive now the question is why don't you receive praise the name of the Lord why don't you receive so you get somebody telling you I spent 10 years without the Holy Ghost then you start asking them what's wrong with you what did you believe I've waited for the Holy Ghost the whole year when the Holy Ghost has already been given and for you are saying you have taken year without receiving what's wrong with your faith praise the name of our Lord now when he said receive on the day of Pentecost he gave and when he gives what do you do you take praise the name of our Lord then I want to ask this who of us is here and you have asked God to give you something who of us here that God has never answered their prayers praise the name of our Lord who of us is here I desire this thing of God and God has never answered me this who of us is here and you can say ah I asked him for this and he never I've waited many years and doesn't give it to me who of us can say that and then how can you say you asked God to give you the H and he has not given how can you say that when God's interest what brought Christ on the cross is to die for you that you may receive his life and then you say I've taken years without receiving the Holy Ghost what are you up to Why did you get saved why because to get saved means that I want his life in me and he has promised that I send you the promise of my father and he said wait for a few days and on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came down the Holy Spirit and then you start running from church to church looking for the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not anywhere the Holy Ghost is right before you you receive praise the name of our Lord oh when are we going to have a conversion when are we going to have a powerful preacher come when are we going to have this man of God come you are looking for the wrong thing praise the name of the Lord looking for the wrong thing let us go to Romans chapter 10 praise the name of our Lord Romans chapter 10 and then verse 6 the Bible says but the righteousness which is of Faith speaks on this wi say not in your heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to say to bring Christ down from above praise the name of our Lord oh who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead and this is the Mind many people have about the oh God I wish I was there on the day of Pentecost and then I would be there I would say tongue of fire here then he says oh no God you sent us a prophet oh God I wish I was there in jerson Ville Indiana and they go to the prayer line and they me you're going to get the Holy Ghost where is your face but this what people think oh when are you organizing great Revival that we can come and receive the Holy Ghost where is your face praise the name of the Lord the Bible is saying in verse six that s not now this is what you're saying in your heart who shall go to heaven to do what to bring down Christ because you knew he went to heaven and you think he's still in heaven and then another say he went to hell and he's still down in hell oh you say maybe I wish I was in oh I wish I was May in Jerusalem oh I wish I was with that man of God for me lazy [Music] ghost where is your face until there was a brother who was falsely encouraging others you know if you don't make it in the Rapture will be there the foolish the foolish vir this message is not for the foolish virgins praise the name of our Lord this message is for the wise virgins why God has given us a message is to have the life of Jesus CHR praise the name of our Lord that's the purpose believe the word of Gody the word of God and the Holy Ghost comes now he says who shall bring up Christ Christ is not talking about Jesus but saying Christ and what is Christ the Holy Spirit he says don't say who bring the holy ghost from Heaven who bring the holy ghost from H verse but what says it the word is near thee how near is the word to you he explains in your mouth in your heart do you have a mouth how far is your mouth from you do you have a heart how far is your heart from you so what you need is that word to settle in your heart Holy Ghost comes praise the name of our Lord that's all you need the Bible says he gives the Holy Spirit to them that believe the question is are you a Believer or not praise the name of the Lord let us go to acts 5:32 acts 5:32 and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that obey him very simple who receives the Holy Ghost does that obey now what is wrong with you not to obey what your word then why did you confess Jesus don't want to word it's just as simple as that then somebody says I've taken a h year I'm looking for the Holy Ghost I don't know you don't know what you are looking for that's the whole thing praise the name of our Lord you don't know what you're looking for so you are going this way then again the other one tells you when I Reed the Holy Ghost the light came on the wall then I started roaring around you're not looking for the Holy Ghost you were looking for roaring around praise the name of when I got the Holy Ghost jumped up and down so you're also looking for jumping up and you're not looking for the Holy Ghost me when the Holy Ghost came felt a lot of energy I felt something burning in my heart that's what you're looking for you're not looking for the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of Lord now we have where Satan has tricked us to look for emotions for the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that is deceptive when you look at the baptism of the holy spirit in the scriptures the emotions were not the same and the things which happened were not the same so now if you are looking for you may get the emotion without the Holy Ghost and then you start CH but he fa what you call the spirit was not the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the life of Jesus and so when you are seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit look for the life of Jesus Christ don't look for jumping around dancing around running feeling nice or crying or doing whatever don't look for that the ho spirit is so sov you don't direct the Holy Ghost now you come and have a tongue of fire on on the day of Pentecost they receive tongues of fire but the rest of the scriptures you don't see that tongue of fire on there now when they didn't get the tong of fire you they didn't get the Holy Ghost praise the name of our Lord on the day of Pentecost there was a lot of sound you know it was a whole commotion until all the body emotions you know they felt the eyes saw the fire the ears had the noise the body felt the wind praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says TS of fire appeared you know like when you get a candlestick [Laughter] you know and then you put it in your sitting room or outside and then the wind blows you know it is like this so that's what was on their heads it was Vis seen but in the rest of the scriptures you don't see that on their head you mean they didn't get the Holy Ghost praise the name of on the day of Pentecost there was a mighty sound from heaven and then filled where they were when you read other places it was only one place where the Bible says they received the Holy Ghost and the place shook but other places there was no shaking of the place there was no great noise around you mean they didn't get the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came their tongues were quickened until they spoke with other but when you follow other places some places they never even spoke with us you mean they didn't get the Hol praise the name of the Lord in some places they prophesy in some places they didn't prophesy you mean they didn't get the Holy Ghost praise the name of our Lord let us go to Acts chapter 9 praise the name of the Lord and then verse 17 so the scripture says and ananas went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Soul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto the in the way at thou as thou comest has sent me that thou might receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost sa praise the name of the Lord know he was on the road to Damascus to persecute the children of God and so as he was on the way a bright shining light and then he fell down then he heard s why do you persecute me praise the name of our Lord now was the one persecuting the children of God that they under false worship because they accepted the Lord Jesus as their personal because they said Jesus Christ is the Messiah because they said Jesus Christ is the Living God so he was saying you are wrong and killing many of them and now God praise the name of you see how the grace of God work he came in the way that Saul would understand him so he came as a pillar of fire in the Old Testament the pillar of fire was the one leading the children of Israel from Egypt to Canaan praise the name of the Lord and so it was the glory of God so he came under the same Pillar of Fire saw said this is my Lord this is the god almighty this who created said oh God who are you you know he was persecuting god without knowing that he's doing that because he was in his religious system praise the name of our Lord still saying God can never put on flesh said who are you who are you my Lord did he tell I am Jesus praise the name of our Lord so now Saul that light made him blind made him totally blind so when they took him to the sit by the hand he was praying and fasting God oh God I didn't know you were God I've done those things oh God I was pouring my father's God I was pouring my God supp he was repenting Lord forgive me he was now thinking of those things he has been doing my father's religion the soul that sin it shall die if it's the religion of your father you also need to make your personal decision when you receive the Gospel to make a personal decision so now Paul rejected the traditions of his father and he accepted the revelation of Jesus Christ so now after 3 days during the three days the Bible says this is a blind man and then Jesus Christ went and to ananas who was a prophet and then he said praise the name of the Lord there is a man called sa ofis he's praying and he has seen in a vision now you can imagine a blind man seeing a vision blind but he's seeing a visional things praise the name of our he saw a man but he was blind but the vision he say man coming and laying his hands so ananas is sent by God go and pray for sa now when ananas comes to sa tells brother saw when he was laying his hands on him the Lord Jesus appear to you in the way has sent me to do what two things that I pray for you and you do what and you receive your sight the second thing and you be filled with the Holy Spirit am that's why ananas was sent his prayed for him to do what to receive the sight and to receive the Holy Spirit now the question is did Paul receive his sight and the Holy Spirit that's a question we got the next verse and immediately they fell from his eyes as had been SC and he received sight fourth you know the Bible says the scales fell down and was able to see this is ananas this is where I am and the Bible says when the scales he arose and was baptized now the question is did Paul who called sa receive the Holy Spirit or no there was no emotion there he didn't start jumping around he didn't speak in Tong he didn't prophesy they didn't seem feeling something different the scar spr from the eyes he arose and he was baptized and he was given F to did he receive the Holy Spirit oh no I know maybe the writer forgot right what happened praise the name of the day of pentec they said the TS of fire then he speaking in tongues and then they forget to write what happen Paul sa received the Holy Ghost without any sensation he received the Holy Ghost without any sensation praise the name of our Lord now let us go in the message says is this the time and then it is in slide 15 and then it says he says let us go to 260 paragraph 260 which I've highlighted there he says all these Mysteries the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without [Music] sensation I've fallen down I felt like the heart is burning I jump jump the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation it's one of the Mysteries which are revealed by this message it says the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did when you are seeking the Holy Ghost don't look for sensation but look for Christ to be in you praise the name of our Lord look for the life of Jesus Christ don't look for running around up and down feeling emotional look for the life of Jesus Christ because brother Bram says it's one of the Mysteries to be revealed by the seventh angel it's one of the Mysteries that God revealing today in the message that he has given to us and you see your soul receive the Holy Ghost without any emotion didn't receive the spirit there was no prophesying there was no speaking in Tong there was no jumping up and down there was no tongue of fire on his there was no wind around praise the name of the Lord the baptism of the Holy Ghost without emotion praise the name of our Lord now I want us to get further trying to see that we manage time so we go to slide I have to jump many things we go to slide number 12 he says you believe God and say you believe God and haven't received the Holy GH then you says there is something wrong with your face then he says because God is under obligation to give every believer that repents and is baptized is under obligation to give you the baptism of the Holy Spirit now you you see because the Bible says 2: 38 repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus CHR and you shall receive the gift of the Holy for the promise is yours and to your children and those that are far off as far as many as the Lord shall call go 2: bring it and then get back to this praise the name of our Lord he says repent have you repented or did you repent be baptized were you baptized for the remission of your sins and you shall he's not saying you may but you shall in other words it follows you shall not you may not you could or perhaps maybe no you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost to who verse 39 for the promises unto you put yourself there now and your children you can bring them in and to all that are far off your friends your colleagues all others but now in this scripture far off me the Gentiles we the Gentiles we are part of the promise and then he says as many as the Lord Our God shall call the question is are you called of God or you came here by yourself as many as the Lord praise the name of our Lord as many as the Lord shall call on the day of Pentecost there were thousands of people there at the temple and when they heard this word they said what shall we do praise the name of our Lord now we need to realize that the Holy Spirit starts working on our lives time we accept Jesus Christ as our personal the holy spirit that appointed the minister to preach to you you didn't appoint the minister to come and preach to you he's the one who sent the minister to come and preach to you it was the Ho Spirit when you heard the word it was the Holy Spirit was speaking to when you believe the word you are believing what the Holy Ghost was saying when you obey the word what the Holy Ghost is telling praise the name of so now how far is the holy ghost from you he the word obey the word the spirit comes praise the name of the Lord so now the Holy Ghost is the one that justified you the holy ghost that justified you you justify me remove you just hear the word word and then he takes away your sins you obey the word he sanctifies you obey the word FS with the Holy Spirit the only thing is to obey the that's all praise the name of our Lord hear the word of Gody the word of God the life of Jesus Christ will be formed in you praise the name of our Lord so it's the holy ghost that justifies us the holy ghost that sanctifies us and it's the holy ghost that fills us he knows your walk so he works upon your life for the reason that he wants to dwell inside of you that's what God does obey the word and then God himself he comes and enters your soul praise the name of the Lord in John chter 14 and then verse 21 the Bible says he that has my Commandments and keepeth them it is he that loveth me and he that love me shall be loved of my father and I will love him I will manifest myself praise the name of our Lord he that has my command it is he that love me and he that loveth me Will Be Loved of my father and when God loves you what does he do he says will come and manifest myself to praise the name of the Lord ver 23 he says Jesus answered and said unto him if any man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our aboard with him when you obey the word when you keep the word he says you love him and when you love him he also loves you and when he loves you he comes down and dwells inside your heart that's the baptism of the Holy and you I love God but I don't have the Holy Spirit something wrong somewhere praise the name of our Lord like now this is a bottom praise the name of our Lord this is a bottle of water why do I have this bottle because there is water praise the name of so if you get me in town walking you know the day is hot too so that's why I'm moving with the water and then maybe I siep some water I walk if you don't have money I wish also somebody to buy some water you know the cigarette smokers go ask and those who are who find that they are too thirsty for cigar if he get one which has fallen down and picks it then starts to Puff now this bottle of water I have it I move with it because there is water praise the name of our Lord there's water but now the moment I finish this water it becomes a problem with this water you start wondering where to throw it and unfortunately some of us here when we come to church we just throw bottles anywhere taking them there so you start looking for where to put it because a problem you can't keep it because there's nothing in it it's of no use to you but now when it has water I keep I can't even put it in my pocket I can't even put it around my w if I'm ring a bicyc I put it along the if I have a bag I put it on the side you remember those days of C people would move with bottles of San they are just there after shaking because you are keeping it because of but if you get me in town and this bottle the first day you get with me okay maybe he's going to drink water now if the water is not there get with the bottle then you'll start thinking maybe he's going to buy cooking oil or he's going to draw from a b or is going to buy Para so you're not mindful he's going to use it if the following day you find with EMP start looking at me is he upright why because you keep something valuable like if you have money how do you keep the money do you keep it by putting it here a bundle and then you walk in town or you put it here there are people who are interested in that money than you and the Bible says Satan steals the word of God from your heart he steals it so now the Bible is telling us here that if you love me you keep my word and to keep you train Val like the way you money when you have money don't want that you have money because you will attract feels hide it somewhere and then you move so even the word of God if we really love God we shall have the word of God and keep it in our heart and he says if you have that word in your he says I will love you when he loves you he comes where the word is praise the name of Lord and now does he come in your heart by filling you with the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord so the thing is if you obey the word of God you love God when you love God comes down himself himself that's the scripture we will come and make our AB he comes and settles there he comes and sits there then how do you say I have believed 10 years I don't have the Holy Ghost something wrong praise the name of let go back to the other praise the name of of Our Lord 12 it says and okay it says you believe God and say you believe God and you haven't received the Holy Spirit there's something wrong with your faith because God is under obligation to give who every believer that does what that repents and is baptized is under obligation to give you the baptism of the Holy Spirit and then you're saying 10 years I'm a Believer and I don't have the Holy something wrong then he says and he is more willing to give it to you than you are to receive it praise the name of God is more willing to give you the Holy Spirit than you are there to receive it you don't know what you're looking for praise the name of he's more willing and he released the Holy Ghost praise the name of our Lord so how do you say many I don't have the Holy what did you believe what do you obey something wrong then he says that is right there is something wrong somewhere you just got a mental Faith instead of a face for God is under obligation to keep his word praise the name of our Lord God is under obligation to keep his word praise the name of our Lord now let us go to the church SL 26 so now when you look at that slide it's a demonstration of who we are we have the body and the body has five senses see here smell taste feel that's our body and then the senses help us to contact the natural they don't help us to contact God but sometimes we want to contact God by the outer man I don't I don't feel that you want the natural man to feel God I feel the presence of God all over the this body was given the five senses were are given to us to contact the natural world the physical Conta now inside our bodies we have the spirit the human Spirit and the human Spirit has also got five senses affections like somebody who has affection of football if you say I love football somebody will ask you what happens on Friday what happened last week on Friday on Friday evening what happened then you start saying there was nothing and if you love football and you don't that Uganda was playing on Friday and you don't know that you know it was playing with South Africa and you don't know the number of goals they and you don't know who scored they SC and you don't know who leading the group you don't love football if you love something you follow it like now I don't know nowadays who is the leader of Chess play or the chief chess player in the world but if you say you love chess and you play and you play you don't know in you don't it you don't so if you say I love this like now if you say ah I love and then they ask you what have you planted I'm still just you don't love it you don't love it then you say oh I love teaching and I a teacher when open you don't love it so you have affection of your profession that's affection and because of that affection you find that you have Consciousness there are things you can try to feel uhuh think this is not the way that is also a sense of the spirit and then you have reasoning reason about that I think this thing may not be like this then you have [Music] imagin sports they look at the the lineup said I have a feeling we may not do wellous I wish they had put this player here this one here there is a time I think last year before last year I was getting to Ginger town and then I saw many vehicles and they were hoting I was wondering it was a team in Europe maybe had one Flags everywhere when you talk to those people they will even tell you ask them were you there today we are going to buy this player how much money are you going to put but because of the Love of the Game only spirit is there even know the lineup the age of this player how many goals you scored how much money you know those are things that are happening in the spirit the spirit has given himself to that so even memory he remembers oh last season we failed we not going to fa the human Spirit now beyond the human Spirit there is the soul now under the soul or doubt and God is interested in the soul he says the soul that sin it shall die then he said I put blood upon the alt of the Soul now the baptism of the H Spirit should go beyond your body if it comes on your body you can have those emotions crying feeling something theost can do that on your but you need to go beyond the body the Spirit can come upon your human spirit and when the Holy Ghost comes on your human Spirit you will speak in Tong you will prophesy you will see Visions holy ghost on your human Spirit praise the name of the Lord but you need the Holy Spirit to go beyond your human Spirit you need the Holy Spirit to get into your soul and in the soul one sense Faith doubt em and that's where the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that the holy ghost coming right to your soul no emotion there in the soul but the problem is people look for the Holy Ghost to come on the body to come on the spirit and says I have not received the Holy Ghost praise the name of the Lord now let us look at this in the the number slide number me get it slide number 16 it says sorry too narrow but let me read it okay it says now he was talking about those five Outlets if you'll get time you read it say now to the last man to the last man which is the soul paragraph 125 there is only one sense that controls that that is free moral agents will choose or to reject then paragraph 126 just the same place and the reason that people today don't forget this now and you'll see what the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is says now people can live in this Spirit that's a human spirit and dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit and they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed on that Spirit still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be now we got the next one par 17 so in paragraph 17 he says 209 I wish you put the slides instead so he says but when it is directed from the inside it throws all the rest of it together so he saying our control tower is in the soul and that's where God wants to sit says if you are directed from the insight it throws the spirit and the human body to be under subjection that is the guide post that is the control tower the inside of the inside the soul controls the spirit the spirit controls the body praise the name of our God and that's what we should desire that God can come down there then he says so on the outs okay let us go to paragraph 21 why don't you keep those lights there until I tell you to go to another so he says that's the reason I say people can jump up and down and speak in Tong people can shout lay hands on the sick and heal the sick and so forth by faith all these great things there by the Holy Spirit still be lost praise the name of our Lord we go to the next slide slide number 18 now brother Bram here is putting an emphasis of the baptism of the Holy Spirit to go to the soul not to stop at your human spirit and this is where people get to look for but you need to see that the Holy Spirit gets down to your soul there is no emotion in the soul the name of our Lord so now here brother Bram in 1965 in December he preached four he preached consecutive messages on fourth of December 1965 he preached the message Rapture in the place called yum Arizona the following day he preached the message things that are to be on 50th of December 1965 in a place called writer California and then on the following day 6th of December he preached on Modern events are made clear by prophecy then the following 7th of December he preached the message leadership and now in all this fortive messages he was directing that the baptism of the Holy SP should not stop on your body should not stop on your spirit but should go to your soul and that should be our desire that should be our interest so now in slide 18 in the the message Rapture he says you say you got the baptism the holy ghost that don't mean you are saved not by any long ways look here you are a trained sh you are then he demonstrated he say here is the soul next is the spirit this is the body now part 148 then he says but when it comes to oh I got the anointing is the genuine anointing remember had it too and prophesy so did balam have it and prophesy but don't have nothing to do with this the Insight that was God's seed his from the beginning predestinated then he said you are finished I don't care how much you shout speak with Tong run shout that has nothing to do with it praise the name of so he saying the body can the Holy Ghost can come on the body the Holy Ghost can come on the human spirit and you do all those things but he says if you are only dwelling on that you are lost but where the Holy Ghost should dwell is the soul because that's where the gene of life is now the following day after preaching the message Rapture he preached the message things that are to be and he says you might still dance in the spirit you might speak with Tong and them things are fine but that is not it yet remember the Bible say in the last days there shall come for Christ not false jesuses they wouldn't stand still for that but false Christ false anointed ones they are absolutely Anointed with the spirit with the Holy Spirit and still F then he comes to the church there are three peop of you the outside is the body you got the five senses that you contact your Earth home with that inside is a spirit there are five senses there love conscious and for but the inside of that is the soul the following day is talking about the same then we go to the the following after preaching the message things that are to be number 20 he says in the message modern events are made clear by prophet he says notice we find people today there's many people just can't believe it even spirit filled people I'm going to give you one that will choke you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you are going in not at all not on that don't have nothing to do with your soul that's the baptism see here is inside the soul in here that has to come from God EMP on the soul says but on the outside you have five senses you know inlets you know to contact your Earthly home that's on the body then inside you have a spirit and in that Spirit you have also five Outlets your conscience and love and so forth five Outlets to that Spirit remember that in that Spirit that's the human Spirit you can be baptized with the genine spirit of God and still be lost it is the soul that lives that was a of God praise the name of our that's the third time he's doing repeating it on the fourth day goes back to the in the message leadership he says many think many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you are going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so exactly right then he explains paragraph 163 look here you are outside person you have five senses that contact outside body God gave you five senses not to contact him your three home see test feel smell and hear then you have a spirit on the inside of that that's inside the body and it has five Outlets conscious and love and so forth five Outlets that you contact the spirit world with that with your spirit then your physical contacts the physical your spiritual contact the but inside of you you've got a soul and that soul is that gen that come from God praise the name of our Lord that's where we need the holy spirit in the soul and the holy ghost in the soul there's no emotions there's no Sensations praise the name of our Lord then he says paragra 167 and when a man has been born again by the word of God predestinated to eternal life called the elected it will be word of God on top of word word on top word on Word praise the name of our Lord so now when you are seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit don't look for emotions you can be deceived when you are seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit seek for the life of Jesus Christ that's all seek the life of Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ is inside of you you'll bear his life you'll bear his life the life that you live even the people around you to tell this man is changed praise the name of the Lord where hatred comes you pay with love praise the name of the Lord let us go to Galatians chapter 5 and then verse 22 as I try to wind up Galatians 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Fai weakness Temperance against there is no law the B is saying the fruit of the spirit the fruit of the holy spirit so where does the holy spirit bear his fruit in us so if the spirit of God is in you you will bear the fruit of the SP you'll have love you have joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness Faith weakness Temperance it will be the holy spirit in you which will bring this fruits to manifestation the Holy Ghost is indeed inside of you you know the Bible says let us go to marthew chapter 7 praise the name of our Lord Matthew Chapter 7 and then we read in verse let me get it here Verse 18 he says a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit that's the princip of God what is inside of you is manifested if you have no spirit of God you not bear the fruit of the spirit but if you have the spirit of God you bear the fruit of the SP praise the name of and that should always be our desire and now the Holy Ghost praise the name of is the one that preached to you the word of God the Holy Ghost when you repented and were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is the one who removed your sins is the one who Justified you same Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost is the one that sanctifies you what is sanctification is to be separated from anything evil he makes you to start hating that evil so he's sanctifying you he is separating you and sometimes God can bring strs in your life to cut you off from those things that make make you contrary to him sometimes he can turn your friends to hate you because he want disconnect you from them some sometimes he can make you lose your job because there see there something wrong there sometimes he can make you lose your family members yeah he's interested in the soul that's what is so precious sometimes you can lose your business God is interested in the soul he wants to cut off the that make you not walk ight before him the Young Ruler had a personal character but he locked eternal life and when he came to Christ The Giver of eternal life Jesus looked at him and he loved him praise the name of he loved him then he said go and do this he said I've done done it I've done it I've come to the law I've Obed my parents and the Bible says beholding him you lack says and this is the problem go and sell what you have now he was say it in love praise the name of so when he takes away your business he's doing it in love oh God I don't know why I'm going through this but he doing it in love he wants the most precious thing of you sometimes it can be sickness on your body but he's doing it in love chastisement as a parent if you love your child and your child is doing something funny don't do that doing it don't do that if you love that child you're not going to keep quiet or let me let him you punish him because of love and that's what the Lord does to us to separate us from things so told this young ruler in love go and sell all that you have and give to the poor and come and follow me he talk to him in love but the man was sorrowful who is this to sell the money I've worked to sell the things I've worked for and then get the money and give a poor man and you know poor man if you give him something no it may not return praise the name you've given don't go and demand and this man was a good businessman go and resign from your chairpersonship of the bank said the society is going to ask me are you mad where are you going following Jesus who is Jesus the other day he said foxes have holes have nests but the son of man has no way I one who came and asked him Master where do you dwell said how do you follow such a man who has no address what is his business preaching what is there so it was foolishness to no the Bible says the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is foolishness to the world and God has chosen the foolish things to give us eternal life praise the name of our Lord he has chosen the foolish things to defeat the wisdom of the wise you know the wisdom of the wise if you want to be rich save and don't give up when you come to God give out in and accounting make sure that you hold even somebody's money with you they come asking you just give them a little that you keep to if you have somebody's date even if it's the last money you have it to tell I don't blessed is the one who gives to come receive contr human you're giving out your money what will you he was telling this man out this man just sorrowful he refused he rejected the gospel so he lost eternal life praise the name of our Lord so God cannot dwell there God wants all our all all that you are you give to God and when God comes inside of you let him take charge this man was interested in his business wased in his money and he lost eternal life but yet in the very Bible there was a man called Matthew Levi he was a tax collector a wealthy man Jesus went to the custom and pck him come and follow me he left his business and followed Jesus there was a Man Called Moses he was meant to be the next Pharaoh everything was before him and when God revealed to him Moses Des the riches that he had the glory that he had the the opportunities that and he went to be identified with the children of God who slaves praise the name of our Lord Abraham also he had the gospel the gospel told him leave your parents leave your land come and I take you this way Genesis 12 ver Abraham obeyed we also have the same thing before us the gospel of Christ coming to us what are you going to choose Christ or the things of the world Christ awesome opportunities I have now if you take Christ away and then you follow other things then the Holy Spirit cannot sit in your heart because it is contrary praise the name of our Lord but the Holy Spirit desires to come and live in our life praise the name of our Lord desires to come and live in our lives now in the message the token he says 25 and when we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we have been accepted in Christ and that is our talk that all that we have need of is already purchased by him we are identified with our token the token must be ready the blood Covenant blood is not recognized without the token the word assures us of the promise The Talk is the sign the purchase has been made for us full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to the Token no other way there is that you could ever be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the words praise the name of our Lord that's how you receive the Holy Spirit obey the word hear the word the word you look in the book of Acts you know in the book of Acts the Holy Ghost came on the day of P and F the 12 in that the Bible says there were many who were outside who had come to the worship Feast of Pentecost and now when they had the word preached 3,000 were added to the church how were they added they received the Holy Spirit on the same day of Pentecost and when you read in the book of Acts whoever was believing and baptized they were receiving the holy GH then how do you say we have taken 10 years without
