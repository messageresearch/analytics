love you and we thank you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus this amen amen we can turn to Romans chapter 12 we're reading from verse one to verse two Romans 12 ver vers 1 to verse 2 I beseech you there for Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service [Music] and be be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so I want to preach on the subject Renewing Your Mind Renewing Your Mind praise the name of the Lord so the Bible is telling us let us not be conformed to this world you know to be ConEd in other words you are getting used to what the rest of the world does you know if somebody annoys you you hate them abuse them you know you do all kind of things of Revenge that's how the world handles that but then the Bible is telling us let us not be conformed to this world in other words there is a trend the world handles their things and then there is also a path you know there is a way that God also wants us to handle the things praise the name of our Lord you know like the world you know when you become a young man or a young woman you know when you grow up to become a young man or young woman you know the world teaches you just get a boyfriend girlfri and start living with them and then you find out and nowadays what the world does they are no longer saying boyfriendfriend though it is still there but now they are talking about whereby can live in the same house a man and a woman behave like a husband and a wife but they don't want say this is my wife this is my husband they are living said this is my partner in other words there is no much commitment they don't want to be wed but they want live like that now that's the trend of the world so now you don't get used to how the world handles their things you don't copy what the world does so there you will be conforming to this world but now the Bible is telling us that we need to be transformed and how are we transformed by you know renewing our mind in other words our thinking our understanding has to be changed praise the name of our Lord now the scripture is telling us we need to renew our mind in other words a complete change for better that actually is according to the word of God praise the name of the Lord like you know maybe at your place of work you know is that you're going to be faithful at that place of work you know when you are given an assignment you're going to do the best you can do to be diligent your home you make sure that you do your responsibility so he's saying that we have to have a renewal of our mind a renewing of our mind and now when we get a renewing of the Mind then that one puts us in a better position where we are transformed and when we are transformed we actually pattern the image of Jesus Christ and that should be our desire in everything we do to be like Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so we need to desire to be transformed and now this transformation comes by the change of our mind comes by the renewing of our mind and mind means understanding you know you understand better praise the name of the Lord handing the issues you going through you understand better in other words you can make better decisions and you know change of mind happens with growth praise the name of our Lord as you grow there are some things you have to leave and then there are some things you have to take in as you grow praise the name of Lord like a small kid who are starting learning how to talk there are some they can pronounce and they look funny but that's a great achievement as a parent you're excited then you keep on repeating and keeps on trying trying trying until you find that they able to make it complete and when they beginning to talk they speak only one word but then with time they add on two three 4 10 initi when they want something can say then you say maybe they want water but or sometimes they don't know how to speak and they see carrying something then they just cry for that something you are carrying so there is a change a change of understanding there is a growth so even us when we are walking before God there has to always be a change in our lives praise the name of our Lord when you continue walking with God you don't remain the same you are always transformed you are always changed praise the name of the Lord that means you are growing you are coming to maturity and then you'll find that your patience over issues also changes initially may not be patient with anybody you are only caring about yourself but you know as you walk with the Lord find that God keeps on changing you praise the name of our Lord so we see that understanding the Mind comes by the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord let us go to Proverbs 17 verse 27 he says he that has knowledge spares his words and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit so he says when you have understanding you have an excellent Spirit praise the name of our Lord now when we go to Isaiah chter 11 verse the says and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord so now when when the scripture told us be transformed by the renewing of our mind he's talking about the Holy Spirit giving you an understanding according to the word of God praise the name of our Lord so now as God gives you understanding so even your walk should always be different praise the name of the Lord you don't make decisions like the people don't know God you don't walk like the people who don't know God you know that this is wrong you know this is right praise the name of the Lord like if you have got the understanding of the spirit of God and then you want a cloth you go to the shop now when you go to the shop you're not going to get a transparent cloth if you have the understanding of the Holy Spirit you're not going to get a cloth which exposes your body if you have the Holy Spirit you're not going to get a cloth which is a body tight because the spirit inside is not comfortable with that decision praise the name of the Lord and you find that if you make a mistake and get such a CLA you want to dispose it of immediately why because you understanding your mind has been renewed name of Lord your mind has been renewed it's not like the people of the world praise the name of Lord like on evening Friday evening people are going for party places show places and everything but now if your mind has been renewed you know you have the understanding of the Holy Spirit you not go toes you not go to such funny places instead your mind will desire to go into Fellowship I want to be in the presence of God I want to seek the face of of the Lord because your mind has been renewed praise the name of the Lord so now when the Holy Spirit is within us he will lead us praise the name of the Lord and the Bible says the children of God are led by the spirit of God and the spirit of God does not lead you to evil places but the spirit of God will always lead you to correct places praise the name of the Lord go to First Corinthians chapter and then verse The Script says but God has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit seares all things yeah the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of God Save The Spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knows no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are free given to us of God which things we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual with spiritual praise the name of our Lord so the Bible is telling us we cannot know the things of God unless it is the spirit of God that comes and reveals them to us so then if our minds are going to be renewed we need the Holy Spirit to reveal to us the things of God and now when the things of God are revealed to you and then you are subject to that Revelation then you are transformed praise the name of our Lord you become transformed by the revelation of the word of God it empowers you praise the name of our Lord the Bible says we shall know the truth and the truth shall make us free so the Holy Spirit reveals unto you the truth and then that truth you have known when you rejoice in that truth you become delivered praise the name of our Lord you become delivered of your bondages you become delivered of your weaknesses because you have known the mind of God and the Holy Spirit reveals to us the mind of God the holy spirit gives us the understanding of God praise the name of our Lord we can look at an example of Simon Simeon was an old man and then he was waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Bible says that the Holy Spirit was upon him and now what the Holy Ghost did what the Holy Spirit did the Holy Spirit revealed to Simeon that you are not going to die until you see the Lord is Christ praise the name of our Lord so it didn't matter Simeon was bedridden if sickness would come and hit Simeon down he knew I'm not going to die the Holy Ghost has revealed to me that I'm not going to die until I see the Lord is Christ and we also need to get the same condition praise the name of the Lord that I'm not going to fail I'm not going to fail in this area I'm not going to die here I'm not going to be defeated in this condition why because the Holy Spirit has given you an understanding of the will of the Lord praise the name of our Lord that should be the same thing with us as a young man as a young woman you can make a decision in your life I am not going to be defined like the rest of the young people the of Our Lord like you know people say there are no virgin God but you can say I can stand on the Promises of God I'm not going to be defiled nobody is going to touch me I'm not going to touch anybody until I'm married you can make that decision because you have got the understanding of God and that understanding of God empowers you to fulfill the promise of God praise the name of our Lord Daniel they knew the word of God when they took them to captivity the Bible says they purposed in their heart not to defile themselves what was it they had the understanding of God said Lord your word tells us not to eat the food offer to Idols not to offer not to eat things that are defiled so they puros in their heart we are not going to defile ourselves praise the name of the Lord even you at your place of work you can decide to behave like the rest of these people at your school you can make a purpose praise the name of Lord like now there's a scenario praise the name of our Lord you know there's a univ I was told of you know children go there to study when people go there to study they go they get they call them en and you know man or a woman if a man gets a girl lives with him like a wife that that is M en and it's aure there but you see if you have had an understanding of God you're not going to be defiled with that kind of thing you purpose yourself I'm not going to be defiled by the cultes of this place I'm not going to be derailed by the behaviors of the society that I live in praise the name of our Lord you purpose you make a decision praise the name of the Lord Brother says you know when Paul when he was in the book of Acts they were actually in the ship and then they took about 3 days it was all the time were coming and then Paul was telling these people you people don't do this and this but the boss has refused to hear Paul and then now the angel of the Lord came and revealed to Paul and told him you all going to be safe until you land but now when these people were actually the storms were coming and D was becoming bad they wanted to kill the people because they were prisoners they didn't want anybody of them to escape so and these were not eating food because they were afraid told them you can now eat food we are all safe God has told me that we all going to be and then they became up and started eating food so now when they reached an island before they reached that Island you know the angel revealed to Paul that you are all going to be safe and you're going to stand before Cesar so now when Paul reached the island and then the place was too cold so he got fire firewood and then he started putting lighting fire and then a terrible snake came and beat him and then the men of the island said say this man has survived the the storms but the sins he has are not allowing him to live until he's going to die now and they looked at to die because they said this man must be terrible but the Bible says Just sh off the serpent the Viper like and then now when they Wonder Paul was not dying this one must be a God praise the name of our so brother Bram says had fa that nothing would kill him because God told him you are going to stand before Cesar so no storm would deter that no python would come and kill he had an understanding of the Holy and brother says whenever he sees a vision that was a perfect Faith issue he got perfect faith that nothing can stop what God has shown me that praise the name of the Lord so now even us we can have an assurance we can have an assurance that whatever promise God has given to us he is going to make it come to pass praise the name of the Lord you need to get that Revelation you need to have your mind changed praise the name of the Lord let your mind be renewed when God revealed to Simon you're not going to die what was Simeon waiting for every day Lord I want to see the Christ see the Christ want see the Christ that should also be our promise now the change of our bodies every day saying Lord I'm ready for the Rapture I want a bondage change praise the name of our Lord because that's the climax we are reaching that's the climax that's our adoption you know like a student when a student start school they are looking at the topmost class if a child starts piece one they start looking at pie seven the final exams if a child starts senior one they start looking at senior 4 if he's in senior five they start looking at senior if it starts University first year looking at their graduation even us now we are looking forward to the rupture praise the name of our Lord but now as we keep on looking forward to the rapture we need to have our mind renewed we need to have our mind renewed continuously praise the name of the let us go to Titus Chapter 3 praise the name of the Lord and then verse five not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and by the renewing of the Holy Ghost Titus 3 ver 5 [Music] which is shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior now you look at this very interesting scriptures let us go back to verse five he says not by works of our righteousness salvation is of the Lord praise the name of the Lord not by works of righteousness we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us let us look there both of us pray the name of the Lord but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and by the renewing of the Holy Spirit verse six now he says which he shed on us abundant through Jesus Christ Our Savior now he said which he shed on us what did he shed on us the Holy Spirit and that word sh actuallya brings it out clearly but shed is to pour in other words he poured on us his holy spirit abundantly praise the name of our Lord he saved us he regenerated us and then he poured his holy spirit abundantly salvation is of the Lord praise the name of our Lord you know you can't read these scriptures and then you said the Holy Ghost is hiding now it is hide and seek praise the name of Lord says he shed abundantly praise the name of the Lord he saved you and the baptism of the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy is only pegged on one condition and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the Holy Spirit that's where it is so the thing of it you take that promise of God you are obedient to that promise of God the Holy Ghost comes down praise the name of the Lord so he says he Shar on us the Holy Spirit abundantly praise the name of our Lord God by his grace he pourers the Holy Spirit upon us praise the name of the Lord so you can't say I've looked for the Holy Ghost 10 years then you don't know what the Holy Ghost is praise the name of our Lord because the holy spirit is the door how did you enter in praise the name of the Lord the Holy Ghost ministers to you the entrance unless a man is born again he cannot enter that means that you are still outside it's very funny praise the name of the Lord the Holy Spirit ministers to us an entrance like on Sunday we saying it's the holy spirit that picks you from your sins and walks with you and then he removes your sin justifies you it's the Holy Spirit he keeps on walking with you and then he washes you washing you Wasing you when you are clean then he fills you himself so you become the Tabernacle of God and the Holy Ghost does not stop there but it's the holy ghost that keeps you growing he he becomes your tutor and he's the one who brings to full adoption so you're not that side you're not there and the Holy Ghost is there that means it's your own working of salvation but the Salvation is of the Lord every step that we take it's the grace of God it's by the spirit of God praise the name of our now you can start asking yourself child why haven't you back it's because the holy spirit is holding you is the one working in your life praise the name of our Lord so now we need to allow the Holy Spirit to renew our mind praise the name of and then he keeps on renewing he pours on us himself praise the name of the Lord let us go to Romans chapter 5se praise the name of the Lord Romans 5 and verse 5 another interesting scripture he says and hope makes not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us amen so he says that love of God is powered in our hearts by what by your Works no by your abilities no it is powered in our hearts the love is powered in our hearts by the holy spirit that has been given to us so you can't renew your mind it is the holy spirit that renews your mind the holy spirit that renews your understanding and as the Holy Ghost renews your understanding the Holy Ghost gives you the power to fulfill the understanding of God so that love the Bible says the Holy Ghost pourers the love of God in our hearts and now when the love of God is in your heart you are able to express the love of God you become a living epist not by yourself but the holy spirit that lives in you it gives you the ability it gives you the energy to fulfill the word of God praise the name of our Lord you find that you are living you are not troubled you don't have money in on you but you're not going to behave like other people in the world when people in the world don't have money they try to make a deal of how to cheat somebody or others are not patient they go and they Canal or pick pocket all those who go to The Villages they is not coming and then they break somebody's maze but now when you have the spirit of God he will give you the ability not to do those things much as you don't have but you have enough ability to reject to do evil praise the name of the Lord that's the spirit of God working in your life not your ability praise the name of our Lord so now we need to yield to the spirit of God that the Holy Ghost may keep on transforming us to bring us into the image of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord let us make a comparison here now we go to Romans 1 verse 28 the Bible says and even as they did not retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate man mind to do those things which are not convenient now the Bible says when they reject God when they reject the renewing of their mind by the the Holy [Music] Spirit then God gives them over to an evil spirit and now that terrible spirit gives them a reprobate mind you know an understanding which is terrible not fitful not approved they have an understanding which is contr to the word of God because they have refuse the Holy Spirit to renew their mind give them a better understanding you know to show them the path to take they get a terrible understanding and when they get a terrible understanding they start doing bad things they start doing wicked things when you continue reading in that book of Romans praise the name of our Lord because of a reprobate mind the Bible says they do things which are not convenient and then he Nam some of these inconvenient things 29 being filled with all and righteousness fornication wickedness cous maliciousness let us start again being filled with all unrighteousness forication wickedness maliciousness full of Envy mder debate deit mality Whisperers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud buers inventors of evil things disobedient to Parents Without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection merciful praise the name of our so now you see rejecting the Holy Spirit then you get a terrible mind praise the name of the Lord so then we need to allow the Holy Spirit to renew our mind how is our mind renewed by the word of God the Holy Spirit revealing to us the word of God as the Holy Ghost reveals to you the word of God and you know it's the Holy Ghost doing everything reveals to you you are obedient so he fulfills what he says and then the Bible says the Holy Spirit forers the love of God in our hearts the Holy Ghost refreshes Us Praise the name of our Lord so the Holy Ghost works out our lives as our minds are renewed as we get the understanding of the mind of God so even we are transformed to be in the image of Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord let us also pick another example Romans 7 and verse 25 the Bible says I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin so now we should desire the word of God you know it is the one that renews us and now as we are getting that understanding this is what God wants me to do this is something of God it transforms you you you don't make a decision like the rest of the people praise the name of Lord don't speak like the rest of the people you don't conduct yourself like the rest of the people because you have an understanding which has been renewed praise the name of the Lord and our renewal is continuous every day as you stand before God he keeps renewing you it's a continuous flow praise the name of the Lord not just like a river it keeps on flowing and as it flows it pushes off the trash praise the name of the Lord and that's what the Holy Ghost does in our lives renewed by the Holy Spirit a continuous flow [Music] and the Bible says don't the Holy Spirit why you need it to keep on burning praise the name of our Lord I think it was the other day on Saturday my wife went to visit where our daughter studies from and then now they were sitting in a place and then they were being told that this is where the altar is and then they had put there of stones and then they put the 12 tribes of Israel and then there is a woman who is there most of the time to see that the fire keeps burning and so they tell the people this place is sacred the students so they go there to start praying doesn't want to just sit there but should go there and pray and meditate and they make sure that the fire burs 24 hours so now when my wife was telling me that so she told our daughter this is a shrine praise the name of our but now they are using the the symbols of the Old Testament to see the stones are there the fire is burning so children go there themselves pray down that have G the altar so when she was telling me that that they keep the fire burning and what came to my mind it is the holy spirit that should keep on burning in our hearts praise the name of the Lord we just need to keep the Holy Spirit burning in our hearts continuous light Continuous Flow the Holy Ghost burning maybe when you get a wrong thought the Holy Ghost Burns it you get a wrong desire the Holy Ghost Burns it you get trapped up in something the Holy Ghost Burns it praise the name of our Lord we just need that continuous fire of God in our hearts praise the name of our Lord then it renews us it gives us an understanding according to the word of God praise the name of our Lord and then you are transformed praise the name of our let us go to Titus 1 as I try to finish Titus 1 verse 15 unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled praise the name of the Lord so in our Christian walk we need to seek a renewal by the Holy Spirit as you walk you can become weary you can faint so you need a renewal you need a refresh Moses when he had got the Commandments and then he goes to the camp and the children of Israel were worshiping an idol Moses threw those stones before them you know he was disappointed so now Moses after all the effort he had putting he became so weary because what he was doing was not being followed now he had to go back to God he sought a renewal and he said Lord I want to see your grow was seeking a r he said if I found fav before you see your glory and he found favor before God and so he was renewed and now when he came from the mountain the glory of God was upon his face until was shining prise the name of our Lord and that's why we need also to be renew you need go to renew your mind understanding and then you'll find such joy unspeakable praise the name of the Lord when David sin praise the name of the Lord and then the prophet told him you have done evil David repented and he sought a renewal and then he prayed in Psalms 51 Lord restore unto me the joy of th he was seeking a renewal a refreshment praise the name of our Lord and each and every one of us can seek the same Lord renew me restore unto me praise the name of our Lord and then you see how the Lord can come in brother when he deceived and then the spirit rebuked him that you're hypocrite he went and repented and he went in the forest and he sought a renewal and then the Lord renewed him was so happy praise the name of Lord we also need to renew our mind renewing yourself before God when you renew yourself you restore your joy you restore your strength and you are able to move further than you have been praise the name of Lord when Samson they cut off his hair they removed his eyes but now when the air grew back Samson called the name of the Lord once
