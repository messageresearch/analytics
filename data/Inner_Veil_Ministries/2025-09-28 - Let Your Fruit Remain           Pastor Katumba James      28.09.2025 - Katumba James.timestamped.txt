[26:09] &gt;&gt; I greet you in the name of our Lord
[26:11] Jesus Christ.
[26:13] You're all welcome to the services of
[26:15] the Lord this morning.
[26:18] Thank God for the grace he has given
[26:20] unto us.
[26:22] We appreciate those able to attend the
[26:24] overnight last Friday.
[26:30] Praise the name of our Lord. Then the
[26:32] coming Sunday
[26:35] we are going to have two services
[26:38] that will be 5th of October.
[26:42] We're going to have the Lord's supper.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; And I believe it is good for all of us
[26:49] to be part of it.
[26:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Remember
[26:55] last time when we had the Lord's supper,
[26:59] we we took a service on communion
[27:06] and then in the afternoon we continue
[27:08] with the same
[27:11] I had planned to preach on discerning
[27:13] the lord's body
[27:17] but there was no time but how the lord
[27:19] did it
[27:21] the following day when pastor came to
[27:23] preach
[27:25] in that same area
[27:27] praise the name of so it matters a lot
[27:31] that the programs of church should be
[27:33] part of us
[27:37] because that's how the lord blesses us
[27:40] And that's how the Lord judges our
[27:42] obedience.
[27:46] When the things are given,
[27:49] let us receive them with all our heart.
[27:52] Let us be obedient
[27:55] because each of us we have challenges.
[27:58] We have problems and those will not
[28:00] stop.
[28:02] As long as we live in this body,
[28:06] sickness will always come.
[28:08] Troubles will always come.
[28:11] That's Job 14:1.
[28:19] Praise the name of our Lord. So the only
[28:21] thing we can do is to always find
[28:23] ourselves doing the will of God.
[28:27] And that's why we can get our comfort,
[28:31] our strength
[28:33] and even more grace of God help us go on
[28:35] the journey.
[28:39] Praise the name of our Lord. Coming here
[28:42] for the first time, if you can just
[28:43] raise up your hand.
[28:47] Yes, you're welcome. Quite a number of
[28:49] you.
[28:52] Thank you for being part of today's
[28:53] service.
[28:56] So, we pray for our pastor is not
[28:57] around.
[28:59] He went on
[29:01] on Thursday, I think Wednesday to
[29:04] Botswana.
[29:07] He'll be coming back on Wednesday.
[29:10] Today's having two services
[29:13] then tomorrow two services
[29:16] then on Tuesday two services
[29:20] but he preached on Friday and also
[29:21] Saturday.
[29:24] So just keep him in your prayers.
[29:26] You see part of the family is not
[29:28] around.
[29:30] Praise the name of our Lord. So keep him
[29:32] in our prayers.
[29:34] Then on 19th of October,
[29:40] we going to also two services.
[29:44] We having a visiting minister.
[29:48] Praise the name of our Lord. And we just
[29:51] need to say that we pray for those
[29:52] meetings.
[29:55] Praise the name of our lord. You know
[29:57] before last week,
[30:00] brother Edisco, I don't know how many
[30:02] know brother
[30:05] he passed on. So within this last week
[30:08] was buried
[30:11] and then this Sunday I think
[30:15] &gt;&gt; they having his memorial service at his
[30:17] church former church.
[30:21] But before he passed on,
[30:24] the pastor of that church,
[30:27] brother Tom Ray,
[30:29] &gt;&gt; had called our pastor here
[30:32] and told him that he's coming to spend a
[30:34] weekend with us,
[30:36] [Music]
[30:39] just a weekend.
[30:42] Praise the name over them. So, but we
[30:44] just pray that God gives them grace
[30:46] because being part of the family
[30:51] that they can be able to come as he had
[30:52] promised to come.
[30:54] Praise the name of our Lord. We just say
[30:56] that we prepare for those meetings of
[30:58] 19th.
[31:01] We want to invite as many new ministers
[31:03] as possible.
[31:10] Praise the name of our Lord.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; And then we always want to have a meal
[31:15] together all of us.
[31:19] Praise the name of our Lord. So I would
[31:21] request that we put our support.
[31:25] We make our contribution to brother.
[31:31] We may have quite more people than we
[31:34] have.
[31:36] Praise the name of our Lord. So about
[31:38] one and a half million we need a
[31:40] collection for that lunch.
[31:45] I call upon your contributions.
[31:49] Praise the name of our Lord. I know the
[31:51] fees issue is troubling people.
[31:54] The economy is not doing well.
[31:57] But when God sent Elijah to that widow,
[32:02] she was also giving excuse. You know
[32:04] this is my last meal.
[32:07] I die
[32:08] but that was her giving
[32:12] was her survival.
[32:15] Praise the name of our Lord. So we just
[32:17] need to learn the way of the Lord.
[32:20] Praise the name of our Lord. Brother
[32:22] Malav, you're welcome.
[32:25] Praise the name of our Lord.
[32:28] I believe I will never forget him.
[32:32] Praise the name of our Lord. You know in
[32:35] 1997
[32:38] is the one who received me when I was
[32:40] started studying at Merc.
[32:43] He was a great support to me.
[32:46] I would pick message books from his
[32:48] home,
[32:51] photocopy them, read them on and on like
[32:55] that.
[32:58] And I believe that if we can have the
[33:00] same zeal
[33:02] you know, you're reading the message
[33:03] books on a continuous basis,
[33:08] the Lord will give you grace to
[33:09] overcome.

[39:45] don't have the baptism of the Holy
[39:47] Spirit,
[39:49] if you don't have the oil in your
[39:51] vessel,
[39:54] you know Jesus, you know the wise virgin
[40:00] told the foolish virgin,
[40:03] "Go to them that sell
[40:07] and we in the shop
[40:09] where they sell the oil."
[40:12] Praise the name of Lord. So the more you

[40:16] the word of God, you receive that oil.
[40:21] That's what it is. So we already at the

[46:23] [Music]
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:29] Let us pray.
[46:31] Father, how we are thankful to you this
[46:33] morning.
[46:34] Surely fill our way with your love.
[46:38] Keep on increasing it in our hearts.
[46:41] the love of God
[46:44] that surpasses all understanding.
[46:47] Now, you've taught us in your word that
[46:50] love covers the mort of sin.
[46:53] You taught us also, Lord, that charity,
[46:57] the bond of perfectness.
[47:00] May you fill us more and more of you,
[47:02] Lord Jesus.
[47:04] Even as we've come to the living
[47:05] fountain,
[47:07] may you feel our wells, heavenly father
[47:11] that our wells may keep on springing up
[47:14] also flowing to others
[47:17] that even when we leave this place, we
[47:20] may have that life spring up to our
[47:22] neighbor,
[47:25] spring up to our colleagues,
[47:28] spring up to the people we meet
[47:31] that they may surely know that we have
[47:34] been with Jesus.
[47:36] We love you and thank you father and
[47:38] commit this service into your hands that
[47:41] you may come and speak to us
[47:43] individually
[47:45] for you know each and every one of us
[47:48] what we have need of Lord we pray may
[47:50] take preeminence Lord
[47:53] help all our needs
[47:55] deliver us from all captivity Lord and
[47:58] fill our hearts with your love and your
[48:00] holy spirit
[48:02] We may look on your heavenly father. I
[48:05] know if there be somebody who is sick or
[48:06] afflicted in our midst,
[48:09] may they all be held in the name of
[48:11] Jesus
[48:13] and all the needs of your children. May
[48:15] they all be met for the growth of your
[48:18] remember pastors and ministers in Gabon.

[48:30] your grace may be upon him
[48:33] giving him inspiration and strength
[48:36] to do ministry of your word.
[48:39] We pray you may bless us again.
[48:42] Speak to us heavenly father. Make
[48:44] yourself known to us
[48:46] and Lord your presence be with us
[48:50] and we love you and we thank you.
[48:52] And if there be somebody who has never
[48:54] known you, Lord,
[48:56] may they know you today Lord
[48:59] take you as their personal savior.
[49:02] Blessed be thy name, Lord Jesus. Forever
[49:05] in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray and
[49:07] ask this.
[49:09] Amen. Amen.
[49:11] I request we go to our Bibles.
[49:15] We're reading in the book of John
[49:17] chapter 15.
[49:21] We're reading from verse 10 to verse 16.
[49:27] John chapter 15,
[49:32] the Bible says from verse 10,
[49:41] "If you keep my commandments, you shall
[49:44] abide in my love, even as I have kept my
[49:48] father's commandment and abide in his
[49:51] love.
[50:02] These things have I spoken unto you,
[50:05] that my joy might remain in you, and
[50:08] that your joy might be full.
[50:19] This is my commandment that you love one
[50:22] another as I have loved you.
[50:35] A man laid down his life for his
[50:37] friends.
[50:46] You are my friends if you do whatsoever
[50:48] I command you.
[50:53] Henceforth I call you not servants, for
[50:57] the servant knows not what his Lord
[51:00] does. But I have called you friends. For
[51:04] all things that I have heard of my
[51:06] father, I have made known unto you.
[51:23] You have not chosen me, but I have
[51:26] chosen you and ordained you that you
[51:29] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[51:32] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[51:35] you shall ask of the Father in my name,
[51:38] he may give it you.
[51:57] may go blessing of his word. You may be
[52:00] seated.
[52:01] So I want to preach on this subject.
[52:05] Let your fruit remain.
[52:10] Let your fruit remain.
[52:14] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, very
[52:16] interesting scriptures here.
[52:20] You know, it says in verse 10,
[52:23] if you keep my commandments,
[52:27] you shall abide in my love,
[52:32] even as I have kept my father's
[52:34] commandments
[52:36] and abide in his love.
[52:41] Praise the name of the Lord. He said,
[52:43] "Keep the commandments,
[52:45] then you'll abide in my life."
[52:49] Praise the name of our Lord. And we want
[52:51] to have the love of God.
[52:54] But then how are you going to have the
[52:56] love of God?
[52:58] If you are not obedient to his voice
[53:02] and God judges our love for him
[53:07] by our response to his word
[53:12] even you yourself in our daily life
[53:16] you know this person doesn't love me
[53:19] this one maybe he loves me
[53:22] and you get attracted to the people who
[53:24] hear what you Say,
[53:29] praise the name of the Lord. Like maybe
[53:31] if you are conversing with somebody
[53:34] and then the person is looking at you
[53:38] and is following you.
[53:40] You know even psychology
[53:43] explains the people who are interested
[53:45] in you
[53:49] that that one is attracted to you
[53:53] until when you speak
[53:55] They nod their head. When you look
[53:58] somewhere, they also want to follow what
[53:59] are you looking at.
[54:01] When you make a small joke, they also
[54:03] want to follow that.
[54:07] When you are speaking a word, they also
[54:08] want to speak the same.
[54:11] And then they take all what you want.
[54:16] And then here our God,
[54:19] he gives us his word
[54:22] and he wants us to take interest in his
[54:24] word.
[54:26] Praise the name of you know like maybe
[54:28] if you're speaking to somebody and then
[54:31] a person is on their phone
[54:34] then you are speaking
[54:36] what have you said?
[54:39] You even lose the zil to continue
[54:41] speaking.
[54:43] If you have an interesting conversation,
[54:46] you just put it aside.
[54:49] He's not interested in you,
[54:52] you know. But then here is telling us if
[54:56] you keep my commandment
[54:58] then how are you going to keep the
[55:00] commandment of God
[55:03] if you've not heard the word of God?
[55:07] So you must give yourself opportunity
[55:11] to hear
[55:13] and this is what the devil fight.
[55:17] He makes sure that you don't have an ear
[55:20] to hear.
[55:23] There are some things that are taking
[55:24] your time.
[55:27] There are some things that are
[55:28] preoccupying you.
[55:31] So then you don't have the opportunity
[55:33] to hear the word of God.
[55:37] When you don't have opportunity to hear
[55:38] the word of God,
[55:41] then you can't be converted.
[55:44] That's why the Bible says that the seed
[55:46] that fell on the west side.
[55:50] You know the birds came and stole them.
[55:54] And then the scripture says the birds
[55:56] are evil spirit.
[55:59] That is Satan. So Satan's interest
[56:04] is for you not to hear the word of God.
[56:08] And as long as Satan can succeed,
[56:11] for you not hearing the word of God,
[56:14] then there is no way
[56:17] you can find the love of God in your
[56:19] heart.
[56:22] There is no way you can receive eternal
[56:25] life because the entrance is the one.
[56:31] But then the devil is standing at the
[56:33] door and hindering you from hearing.
[56:39] Then the Bible says, their hearts are
[56:43] dark
[56:45] and are preoccupied.
[56:48] Their eyes cannot see.
[56:51] Their ears cannot hear.
[56:55] So the devil plays a lot of roles
[56:59] to make sure that we have no personal
[57:03] relationship
[57:06] with God. Then the Bible says how can
[57:10] two walk together
[57:12] except they be agreed.
[57:14] But then for you how what are you going
[57:16] to agree on
[57:19] which you've not had
[57:21] because the devil has prevented you.
[57:25] from hearing.
[57:27] So now if you succeed in hearing
[57:31] there is another state,
[57:35] the stony ground,
[57:41] a stony ground.
[57:43] The Bible says they received the word
[57:47] and then they rejoiced.
[57:50] But then trials came.
[57:55] They gave up.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; That is not mine.
[58:00] They gave up.
[58:02] And so now the seed that was sown
[58:07] could not continue growing.
[58:10] So that one off.
[58:13] Then there are those who continue
[58:16] which is the worst condition the devil
[58:18] brings up.
[58:21] The plant has grown.
[58:24] It has started to flower.
[58:27] Then the thorns come,
[58:32] the cares of life,
[58:36] the riches of life,
[58:38] the pleasures of life.
[58:41] It's just the devil still playing.
[58:44] You know when the devil came to Jesus
[58:47] he started with something which was like
[58:50] ah it is critical
[58:53] you are hungry
[58:56] why don't you turn those stones into
[58:57] bread
[59:01] praise the name of our lord and then now
[59:03] Jesus was was able to overcome that
[59:07] then he takes him to the mountain
[59:10] shows him all the kingdoms of the world
[59:13] If you worship me, I will give you all
[59:16] the things.
[59:19] [Music]
[59:21] Then he said, "Okay,
[59:23] you know who to worship.
[59:25] Let us go to the temple."
[59:28] The Bible says, "Satan took Jesus to the
[59:31] temple.
[59:34] You know the devil always comes to our
[59:36] levels.
[59:40] He will come to your level
[59:43] and he comes with the things that can
[59:44] persuade you
[59:47] that can draw you from God
[59:50] to pay attention to him.
[59:53] And Satan didn't take Jesus to a shrine,
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; but he said, "Let us go to the church.
[1:00:02] Since you love worshiping,
[1:00:04] this is a place of worship
[1:00:07] and takes him to the pinnacle.
[1:00:10] And then he says, "It is written. You've
[1:00:13] been quoting. It is written." Now I'm
[1:00:16] also quoting you Psalms 9.
[1:00:19] It's written. He send his angels
[1:00:22] and you'll not fall down so you can fall
[1:00:26] down
[1:00:28] quoting the scriptures.
[1:00:31] Satan, he always comes to our level.
[1:00:36] But to overcome Satan,
[1:00:39] You must learn to continue in the word
[1:00:42] of God.
[1:00:45] Praise the name of our Lord. If you
[1:00:47] don't continue in the word,
[1:00:50] then he will take a hold of you. Now
[1:00:53] when Satan had been defeated,
[1:00:56] the Bible say he left him for a while.
[1:01:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:01:04] and read the book of Luke chapter 4.
[1:01:09] Luke chapter 4
[1:01:15] and then verse 13.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And when the devil had
[1:01:19] ended all the temptation,
[1:01:22] he departed from him for a season."
[1:01:31] So he would come back,
[1:01:34] he comes and checks
[1:01:37] How are you standing?
[1:01:39] How is your prayerful life?
[1:01:42] How is your study life?
[1:01:46] Who are your friends? Now, what you
[1:01:48] esteem more
[1:01:51] after season
[1:01:54] where Jesus was preaching
[1:01:56] and then the devil came into a woman and
[1:01:59] then the woman said,
[1:02:03] "Blessed is the womb that gave birth to
[1:02:05] you.
[1:02:08] Blessed are the breast you circle.
[1:02:12] What was he doing? Taking his attention.
[1:02:17] I don't know how she was dressed.
[1:02:20] But of course, when she said,
[1:02:23] your attention is attracted towards her.
[1:02:26] And if she's dressed in a funny way,
[1:02:29] you know, it's a target.
[1:02:34] Then he said, "Rather, blessed are they
[1:02:36] that hear the word of God."
[1:02:42] Then again he was preaching somewhere.
[1:02:45] Then again his family came and then they
[1:02:48] told him your family has come.
[1:02:52] Then he said no this is my family here.
[1:02:57] Satan keeps on coming.
[1:03:01] But how can how will he find you?
[1:03:05] Praise the name of God. Now back to the
[1:03:07] book of John chapter 15.
[1:03:12] He says, "If you abide in my command,
[1:03:16] you will abide in my love.
[1:03:19] Even as I have kept my father's command,
[1:03:22] I abide in his love."
[1:03:26] Verse 11, "These things have I spoken
[1:03:29] unto you.
[1:03:32] that my joy
[1:03:34] might remain in you.
[1:03:38] Now these are very interesting things.
[1:03:42] Verse 10 says, "If you keep my
[1:03:45] commandments, you shall abide in my
[1:03:47] word."
[1:03:49] Verse 11 says,
[1:03:51] "As I've spoken to you,
[1:03:55] so my joy may remain in you."
[1:03:58] So now if you don't hear God speak to
[1:04:01] you,
[1:04:03] how you going to have his joy?
[1:04:06] So we need to take opportunity
[1:04:09] that we desire God to speak to us
[1:04:14] as many times as possible.
[1:04:18] And then God, you know, when God speaks
[1:04:20] to you,
[1:04:22] you know, he speaks to you love,
[1:04:26] peace, salvation, that even the troubles
[1:04:29] sometimes you are going through
[1:04:32] all go away.
[1:04:34] But then you need to desire God to speak
[1:04:36] to you.
[1:04:39] reading his word,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; meditating upon his word,
[1:04:44] hearing his word,
[1:04:46] living the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:04:51] says, "This is my commandment
[1:04:54] that you love one another as I have
[1:04:57] loved you. Greater love has no man than
[1:05:00] this.
[1:05:02] A man laid down his life for his
[1:05:05] friends.
[1:05:09] Then verse 14, he says, "You are my
[1:05:12] friend.
[1:05:14] If you do whatsoever, I command you."
[1:05:19] Henceforth,
[1:05:21] verse 15, I call you not servant.
[1:05:26] For the servant knows not what his lord
[1:05:29] does,
[1:05:32] but I have called you friends.
[1:05:35] For all things that I have, Father,
[1:05:40] I've made known to you. Now, you look at
[1:05:43] the relationship
[1:05:45] that Christ brings us into.
[1:05:49] Now, you see that in John chapter 13,
[1:05:54] praise the name of our Lord. In John
[1:05:56] chapter 13
[1:05:58] and then verse 13, he says, "For you
[1:06:01] call me master and lord
[1:06:04] and you say well for so I am
[1:06:09] I then your lord and master
[1:06:15] have washed your feet." He also ought to
[1:06:18] wash one another's feet.
[1:06:23] So then he is calling them
[1:06:26] servants.
[1:06:29] Praise the name of our Lord. Then as
[1:06:32] they continue walking with him
[1:06:36] as they continue knowing the mind of
[1:06:38] God.
[1:06:40] He says you know what I'm going to do.
[1:06:43] I no longer call you servant
[1:06:46] but I call you friends.
[1:06:49] That's a better relationship.
[1:06:52] Praise the name of the Lord. That's a
[1:06:54] better relationship.
[1:06:57] But it's a continuous walk with God
[1:07:00] that your relationship with him
[1:07:04] keeps on improving.
[1:07:07] Praise the name of Lord. Don't be a
[1:07:09] don't be a person on the peripheries
[1:07:15] on the borderline.
[1:07:17] You know, you only fool the religious
[1:07:19] kind of, you know, norms and rights.
[1:07:24] I'm going to church. I go,
[1:07:26] having a Bible, have been baptized. I've
[1:07:29] been baptized.
[1:07:32] But go further than that
[1:07:35] is that when I have my Bible,
[1:07:38] I don't read it on Sunday.
[1:07:41] And you know, some people are afraid of
[1:07:43] carrying their Bible.
[1:07:46] Mine is on the phone but the main reason
[1:07:51] not because of anything
[1:07:56] but how will they see me when
[1:08:00] then you are still on the periphery
[1:08:01] there.
[1:08:05] You can't even confess God in the
[1:08:07] public.
[1:08:10] But we need to have a closer walk with
[1:08:12] God,
[1:08:13] a more relationship with God.
[1:08:17] You know that you are not afraid to
[1:08:18] testify.
[1:08:20] You're not afraid to tell people I'm
[1:08:22] born again.
[1:08:24] Tell your neighbors I'm a saved person.
[1:08:28] You don't have to tell the people around
[1:08:30] you I'm born again.
[1:08:33] Praise the name of our Lord. So we it
[1:08:36] depends on how much we relate with God.
[1:08:40] So now from service
[1:08:43] you get into a friend of Jesus.
[1:08:46] Praise the name of Lord. But then you
[1:08:49] see after the resurrection,
[1:08:52] he comes and tells the disciples,
[1:08:56] you are now my brethren,
[1:09:01] praise the name of Lord. In John 20
[1:09:04] verse 17,
[1:09:08] Jesus says unto her,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; "Touch me not.
[1:09:13] I am not yet ascended to my father,
[1:09:17] but go to my brethren
[1:09:21] and say unto them, I ascend to my father
[1:09:26] and your father to my God and your God.
[1:09:32] We need to become brethren of
[1:09:36] a sister of Jesus Christ, a brother of
[1:09:39] Jesus Christ. And then the scripture
[1:09:41] says in Romans 8,
[1:09:44] we are joint hairs
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:48] like in our families. Whom do you share
[1:09:51] your inheritance with?
[1:09:54] Your brothers and sisters.
[1:09:56] Then he brings us to that level
[1:09:59] that we are joint hairs.
[1:10:02] It's all about our personal
[1:10:04] relationship.
[1:10:08] Praise the name of have the personal
[1:10:10] relationship with God
[1:10:13] so that you continue
[1:10:16] into that intimate relationship
[1:10:20] not on the outside.
[1:10:23] Praise the name of not fulfilling the
[1:10:25] religious conditions or requirements
[1:10:30] personal relationship
[1:10:33] that when you speak, you know that God
[1:10:36] hears my prayer.
[1:10:38] Praise the name of our Lord. God knows
[1:10:41] what my heart is.
[1:10:43] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:10:45] what to do to please the Lord.
[1:10:48] Blessed be the name of our Lord.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let us go back to verse 16
[1:10:54] which is our focus tonight.
[1:10:58] John 15:E1 16.
[1:11:02] The Bible says you have not chosen me.
[1:11:08] But I have chosen you.
[1:11:11] Praise the name of God. That should make
[1:11:14] you happy
[1:11:16] that I'm not here
[1:11:18] because of my own.
[1:11:21] here because God has chosen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of We are all being
[1:11:27] chosen by God.
[1:11:29] And he says, "I have chosen you."
[1:11:33] You know, you look at the number of
[1:11:35] people who are walking on the streets.
[1:11:39] Some of them are doing their business.
[1:11:42] But then for you, put everything aside.
[1:11:46] I want to be in the presence of God.
[1:11:50] God has chosen you
[1:11:52] of the many people. You have been
[1:11:55] chosen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[1:12:00] says and ordained you.
[1:12:05] He appointed you.
[1:12:08] He made you. He has set you.
[1:12:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Now he has
[1:12:15] chosen us. And then the Bible says
[1:12:19] In Ephesians chapter 1 verse three
[1:12:26] in Ephesians 1:3
[1:12:30] blessed be the God and the father of our
[1:12:32] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:37] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:12:41] blessings in heavenly places in Christ.
[1:12:45] According
[1:12:49] as he has chosen us
[1:12:52] in him before the foundation of the
[1:12:55] world
[1:13:01] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:13:04] before him in love.
[1:13:09] Praise the name of our Lord. God has
[1:13:11] chosen us
[1:13:13] and the Bible says he has chosen us
[1:13:17] before the foundation of the world.
[1:13:20] Before you were born,
[1:13:23] God chose you.
[1:13:25] Praise the name of God. Before you know
[1:13:28] you came to know anything,
[1:13:31] God had already chosen you. The Bible
[1:13:34] says before the foundation of the world,
[1:13:38] we were in the mind of God.
[1:13:42] For what reason were we in the mind of
[1:13:44] God
[1:13:46] that we can bear fruit?
[1:13:49] Praise the name of Lord. So he chose us
[1:13:53] and when he chose us, he ordained us.
[1:13:58] He set us.
[1:14:00] Praise the name of God. So he chose us.
[1:14:04] He ordained us and then he says that we
[1:14:07] should be holy
[1:14:10] without blame
[1:14:12] before him in love.
[1:14:15] Now you look what the way God works.
[1:14:18] The one he has chosen.
[1:14:21] He takes interest.
[1:14:24] He he he goes to them to speak to them.
[1:14:30] Praise the name of our Lord. Jesus went
[1:14:32] on the on the seashore.
[1:14:35] There were so many fishermen on the sea,
[1:14:39] but none of them did Jesus take
[1:14:43] interest,
[1:14:45] other than going to to Peter,
[1:14:49] other than going to James and John.
[1:14:56] Praise the name of Paul. was moving with
[1:14:59] soldiers
[1:15:01] of the temple and then they were going
[1:15:05] but only one had a clear voice.
[1:15:10] Saul s why you persecuting
[1:15:13] the others others were also persecuting
[1:15:15] him
[1:15:17] but they never heard their names being
[1:15:19] called.
[1:15:21] Praise the name of we have been chosen.
[1:15:25] Praise the name of God. We are not here
[1:15:27] on our own
[1:15:29] but we are here because God has chosen
[1:15:32] us.
[1:15:34] Praise the name of God. So even in your
[1:15:36] trials,
[1:15:38] even in your troubles,
[1:15:40] even in the challenges you go through,
[1:15:42] you just need to tell the devil. God has
[1:15:46] chosen you. Praise the name of that
[1:15:51] can give you faith to keep on pressing
[1:15:54] on. Praise the name of our Lord. He has
[1:15:57] chosen us. Paul said, "The God who
[1:16:01] separated me from my mother's womb.
[1:16:05] How he has chosen me."
[1:16:08] That gave po encouragement
[1:16:11] in the midst of the challenges he went
[1:16:12] through.
[1:16:14] He stood firm in everything.
[1:16:17] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[1:16:19] Bible says he has chosen us before the
[1:16:23] foundation of the world.
[1:16:26] We should be holy
[1:16:28] and without blame
[1:16:30] in him in love. So he had a purpose of
[1:16:34] choosing us
[1:16:36] that we can be holy and without blame
[1:16:39] with God.
[1:16:41] Having predestinated us
[1:16:44] and to the adoption of children
[1:16:48] by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:16:52] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:16:54] will.
[1:16:57] Praise the name of our Lord. So when God
[1:17:00] chooses you,
[1:17:02] he makes everything work out
[1:17:06] to bring you to your destiny
[1:17:11] for you to fulfill the purpose of God.
[1:17:16] When he chose Abraham,
[1:17:19] praise the name of God took interest,
[1:17:24] you know, he went to him,
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; called him Abraham.
[1:17:29] leave your country.
[1:17:31] Come unto a land I'm going to show you.
[1:17:34] What did Abraham do? He obeyed. That's
[1:17:38] the same thing you also need to do. Be
[1:17:41] obedient to the word of God. And that's
[1:17:44] how you keep the commandments of God.
[1:17:47] And when you keep the commandments of
[1:17:48] God,
[1:17:50] you are going to abide in my love.
[1:17:55] Not your own love, but his love. So now
[1:17:59] the more you obey the word of God,
[1:18:01] the more God gives you his love
[1:18:06] himself.
[1:18:07] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[1:18:09] God works.
[1:18:12] He speaks, you receive, you pray, then
[1:18:16] you become the manifestation of what
[1:18:19] you manifest what he has spoken.
[1:18:22] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:18:25] God testified about Abraham.
[1:18:28] Said, "I know Abraham."
[1:18:32] Let us go to Genesis chapter 18.
[1:18:36] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:18:38] Genesis 18.
[1:18:41] And then verse 18,
[1:18:45] the scripture says,
[1:18:48] "Seeing that, okay, verse 17,
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; and the Lord said,
[1:18:54] Shall I hide from Abraham that thing
[1:18:56] which I do?
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So if you
[1:19:02] have been chosen,
[1:19:05] God will not hide from you what he's
[1:19:06] going to do.
[1:19:09] He will reveal his secret.
[1:19:12] He will show you his curse.
[1:19:15] He will direct you his purpose.
[1:19:19] Shall I hide from Abraham
[1:19:22] that which I'm going to do, seeing that
[1:19:26] Abraham
[1:19:27] shall surely become a great and mighty
[1:19:30] nation
[1:19:33] and all the nations of the earth
[1:19:37] shall be blessed in him.
[1:19:42] Praise the name of our Lord. God says,
[1:19:44] I'm not going to hide.
[1:19:47] because of what I've promised him to do.
[1:19:52] He's going to do that. He's going to
[1:19:55] become a mighty nation.
[1:19:57] All the earth is going to be blessed in
[1:19:59] him.
[1:20:01] God gave the promises.
[1:20:04] And so what do we do? We obey what he
[1:20:06] has given us.
[1:20:08] Praise the name of God. And then verse
[1:20:11] 19 is where we need to participate in.
[1:20:16] He says,
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; "For I know Abraham,
[1:20:20] what will he do?
[1:20:24] He will command his children
[1:20:30] and his household after him.
[1:20:34] And they shall keep the way of the Lord
[1:20:39] to do justice and judgment
[1:20:42] that the Lord may bring upon Abraham
[1:20:48] that which he has spoken of him.
[1:20:52] God spoke.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; So when he speaks, we believe, we obey,
[1:20:58] we do what he's telling us. And what he
[1:21:01] has spoken
[1:21:03] comes to pass in our lives. That's what
[1:21:05] he's testifying about our
[1:21:08] going to command his children
[1:21:12] to keep the way of the Lord.
[1:21:14] Then God will make to pass
[1:21:19] what he has promised.
[1:21:21] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[1:21:23] the Lord works.
[1:21:25] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[1:21:28] he has chosen us
[1:21:30] before the foundation of the world
[1:21:33] and ordained us.
[1:21:36] In other words, he has appointed us.
[1:21:40] John 15:16.
[1:21:43] Praise the name of our Lord. He says,
[1:21:45] "You have not chosen me,
[1:21:48] but I have chosen you.
[1:21:51] and ordained you
[1:21:54] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[1:22:00] and that your fruit
[1:22:04] should remain
[1:22:08] that whatsoever shall ask of my father
[1:22:10] in my name
[1:22:14] he may give it to you.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our lord. So he says
[1:22:19] he has chosen us.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; He has you know ordained us.
[1:22:27] So then he says the purpose of this
[1:22:32] we may bring forth fruit
[1:22:36] and when we bring the fruit
[1:22:38] our fruit
[1:22:40] should remain.
[1:22:42] In other words, the fruit should dwell.
[1:22:47] The fruit should continue.
[1:22:50] The fruit should not be changed.
[1:22:54] But the fruit should be alive.
[1:22:58] And you know when it remains
[1:23:01] we are looking at something that
[1:23:03] continues
[1:23:06] and continues even increasing
[1:23:10] because that's the principle of anything
[1:23:14] is one seed multiplies.
[1:23:19] Praise the name of our Lord. You can
[1:23:21] take only one seed
[1:23:24] of maze.
[1:23:26] Maybe it can be one plant.
[1:23:29] When you plant it, when it matures,
[1:23:33] that one seed of maze
[1:23:35] can produce a hundreds of seeds.
[1:23:41] Then in the next season,
[1:23:43] you planted only one plant.
[1:23:47] But those are those hundreds of seeds of
[1:23:49] from one plant
[1:23:53] can maybe plant let me say a quarter.
[1:23:59] And then now when you have harvested
[1:24:01] that
[1:24:03] you can find that quarter
[1:24:06] the harvest
[1:24:08] can plant a square mile.
[1:24:13] So the seed is remaining
[1:24:17] but then it is increasing.
[1:24:21] That should be the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:24] Praise the name of God. Let it increase.
[1:24:28] Let it continue.
[1:24:30] Praise the name of God. You as an
[1:24:32] individual, when you receive Jesus as
[1:24:35] your personal savior,
[1:24:37] it didn't stop with you. But then you
[1:24:40] testify.
[1:24:42] You tell others about the goodness of
[1:24:43] the Lord and they accept and then they
[1:24:47] increase. It keeps on increasing.
[1:24:52] Even you your way life,
[1:24:54] you find that you know you are a a a
[1:24:57] soothing point to others,
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; a point of joy,
[1:25:05] a point of comfort
[1:25:08] where people can come and rejoice
[1:25:11] because of your knowledge in Christ.
[1:25:14] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:25:16] message, wisdom versus faith,
[1:25:23] In paragraph 326
[1:25:29] he says rivers.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; The nine spiritual gifts.
[1:25:38] Rivers of one water.
[1:25:43] One spirit.
[1:25:46] One water.
[1:25:50] but coming from nine different
[1:25:52] resources.
[1:25:57] Rivers of water,
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; rivers of water
[1:26:02] that bringeth forth his fruit,
[1:26:05] fruit of the spirit
[1:26:08] in his season,
[1:26:11] his leaves also shall never wither,
[1:26:15] and whatever he does shall prosper.
[1:26:20] See, some fell down in the valley
[1:26:27] where the rivers are
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; and brought
[1:26:37] to something else.
[1:26:40] What was it done?
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; It fell down
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; in the river. It wasn't set out.
[1:26:53] Then he says, "He shall be like a tree
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; set out
[1:27:01] transposed.
[1:27:07] From this to that,
[1:27:11] he was planted."
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:27:16] predestinated.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. That sort
[1:27:21] of God
[1:27:23] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:27] placed him there
[1:27:30] not stuck out by not by chance
[1:27:35] but was planted
[1:27:38] predestinated
[1:27:41] to the rivers of water.
[1:27:45] Now he says planted
[1:27:49] who planted
[1:27:51] God himself. The way he has said he has
[1:27:55] chosen us then he has ordained us.
[1:28:00] Praise the name of our Lord. So he has
[1:28:02] chosen us. Then he has ordained us.
[1:28:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Like here
[1:28:10] we live here in Ginger.
[1:28:13] So God planted us in ginger.
[1:28:18] Praise the name of And when he planted
[1:28:20] us in ginger,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; he put a valley here
[1:28:27] where there a flow of rivers of water.
[1:28:32] He put here a fountain
[1:28:35] so that if I'm in
[1:28:39] I can come at my
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; and drink of that water.
[1:28:44] If I'm in
[1:28:46] I can come at my
[1:28:49] drink of that water. If
[1:28:52] I can come at my
[1:28:55] drink of that water he has planted us.
[1:28:59] He has set us here and he knows what we
[1:29:03] have need of.
[1:29:06] So now if he has put us around,
[1:29:09] he knows what we have need of. So what
[1:29:12] should I do? When he says service is
[1:29:15] here,
[1:29:16] I say amen and I present myself.
[1:29:21] Then I keep on drinking, keep on
[1:29:23] drinking, keep on drinking. And then you
[1:29:25] see that your weaknesses go away, your
[1:29:28] failures go away. Your life is changed.
[1:29:32] That's how the Lord replenishes us.
[1:29:36] He keeps on supplying our needs.
[1:29:39] He encourages you here. He rebukes you
[1:29:42] here. He guides you here. That's how the
[1:29:45] Lord keeps on doing it.
[1:29:48] Praise the name of Lord. So he says he
[1:29:50] has planted us.
[1:29:52] He has predestinated us.
[1:29:55] He has set us and then he gives a stream
[1:29:58] flowing
[1:30:00] and then he keeps on releasing the flow.
[1:30:05] And when he releases the flow, we keep
[1:30:07] on drinking.
[1:30:09] And now the more we keep on drinking,
[1:30:12] praise the name of our Lord. I want to
[1:30:14] get into this message.
[1:30:17] Praise the name of our Lord. In the
[1:30:20] message, show us the father.
[1:30:22] He says, "And when we take a promise of
[1:30:25] God
[1:30:27] and drop it into our heart,
[1:30:31] we keep watering it with faith
[1:30:36] and it keeps pushing out
[1:30:39] pushing out." Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:42] When Christ is planted in our heart,
[1:30:46] the Holy Ghost, the only thing we do is
[1:30:51] drink in the word of God
[1:30:55] and then it pushes out salvation.
[1:30:58] It pushes out divine healing.
[1:31:01] It pushes out glory.
[1:31:03] It pushes out
[1:31:06] healing.
[1:31:08] It pushes out everything that we have
[1:31:12] need of.
[1:31:14] What do we need to do? Keep drinking.
[1:31:19] Praise the name of our Lord. He said,
[1:31:22] "If you keep my commandments,
[1:31:24] if you keep hearing my word, you abide
[1:31:28] in my love, you abide in my job,
[1:31:32] it has to open up."
[1:31:34] Praise the name of the Lord. Lord fill
[1:31:36] me with more of yourself.
[1:31:40] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:31:42] says,
[1:31:43] here is my interpretation of him
[1:31:48] about being the water.
[1:31:51] He is the inexhaustible
[1:31:53] fountain of life.
[1:32:00] You'll never ask him too much.
[1:32:04] You can never believe him for too great
[1:32:07] a thing.
[1:32:12] He delights in you believing him
[1:32:16] for great things.
[1:32:19] You can never overdo it.
[1:32:24] Then brotherham says, could you imagine
[1:32:26] a little fish in half in long
[1:32:31] way in the middle
[1:32:35] of the ocean,
[1:32:37] saying now wait,
[1:32:40] I better think this thing over.
[1:32:46] I better drink very sparingly
[1:32:52] of this water because I may run out this
[1:32:54] year.
[1:32:59] Well, if you could figure that out,
[1:33:03] then try to exhaust the fountain of
[1:33:05] God's goodness to you.
[1:33:10] Praise the name of some of us, we limit
[1:33:13] God like that.
[1:33:18] Let me ask for 10,000.
[1:33:21] Next week I'll ask for another 10,000.
[1:33:24] That's not the God.
[1:33:26] He has everything.
[1:33:29] Ask in abundance
[1:33:32] that you may receive in abundance.
[1:33:34] Praise the name of ask sparingly.
[1:33:39] No, I think
[1:33:43] this time that is not necessary.
[1:33:46] Let me first go for God.
[1:33:49] Tell him what's on your mind.
[1:33:52] God, there is this
[1:33:56] is this just like when you're conversing
[1:33:58] with your friend, you are talking about
[1:34:00] this talking about like David when he
[1:34:04] was with Nathan the prophet said, "But
[1:34:07] you swear I'm sleeping.
[1:34:08] But see where the house of God is.
[1:34:12] Then the prophet told him, "Do what is
[1:34:14] in your heart because God is in your
[1:34:17] heart." And that night, the Lord came to
[1:34:20] the prophet and told him, "Go and tell
[1:34:24] my servant.
[1:34:26] Praise the name of you know God desires
[1:34:29] us.
[1:34:31] Talk it to Jesus.
[1:34:33] Tell him about all this kind
[1:34:35] your fears, your troubles, your needs.
[1:34:40] Praise the name of And you don't limit
[1:34:42] yourself.
[1:34:45] Don't be like that fish in the lake
[1:34:47] Victoria
[1:34:50] just only drinking one spoon of water.
[1:34:54] The water may go may go away.
[1:34:58] Our God is inexhausted.
[1:35:01] Praise the name of the Lord. Ask what
[1:35:04] you will
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; and you shall receive.
[1:35:07] And he says whatever.
[1:35:10] He didn't limit us.
[1:35:13] He says whatever.
[1:35:15] Then you say, Lord, this is my this is
[1:35:18] my desire.
[1:35:20] Praise the name of the Lord. Then he
[1:35:22] says, could you imagine a little mouse
[1:35:24] about half inch long?
[1:35:32] under the big gun of Egypt
[1:35:39] saying, "I'll just eat one grain a day.
[1:35:44] I better allow myself one grain a day
[1:35:50] because I might run before the new crop
[1:35:53] comes in."
[1:35:57] Well my what is he doing? He is
[1:36:01] depriving himself.
[1:36:05] Praise the name of I don't know how many
[1:36:07] of us do that.
[1:36:09] You wake up in the morning only one
[1:36:12] minute to God
[1:36:14] of the 24 hours.
[1:36:17] Now father even your mind is not there.
[1:36:20] So you are hurrying. Oh time has gone.
[1:36:22] You pick up very fast.
[1:36:25] How much are you praying to God?
[1:36:28] How much are you asking God?
[1:36:31] Praise the name of God. You know like
[1:36:34] conversation
[1:36:36] you know there is there is how you start
[1:36:38] it
[1:36:39] and as you go on it becomes more
[1:36:41] interesting
[1:36:43] that's how we should be with God
[1:36:46] sometime you set aside
[1:36:49] you know you start conversing
[1:36:52] Lord I thank you for the night I thank
[1:36:54] you for the day how you protect him from
[1:36:56] the other city you done this you know
[1:36:59] you are trying to take his interest
[1:37:03] to know for to tell God
[1:37:07] you understand what he does for you.
[1:37:11] How he has protected you, how he has
[1:37:13] given you food, how he has led you, how
[1:37:17] he escaped this kind of
[1:37:20] pressure at place of work. They are
[1:37:22] laying off people here. There was
[1:37:25] trouble in the neighborhood. There was
[1:37:27] an accident there. Thank the Lord you've
[1:37:29] kept it.
[1:37:31] I'm healthy. I'm strong.
[1:37:34] Thanking God. Alowed be thy name.
[1:37:39] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:37:41] you say, Lord in what I've done, I did
[1:37:44] this thing wrong.
[1:37:46] I did this thing wrong.
[1:37:49] I thought wrong. I've spoken wrong.
[1:37:52] Forgive me for what I've done.
[1:37:54] You know, you are trying to get yourself
[1:37:56] to his level.
[1:37:59] You are seeing that the blood covers
[1:38:00] your trespasses.
[1:38:03] But even the blood after it has taken
[1:38:05] away,
[1:38:07] you still have need.
[1:38:10] But there is this issue.
[1:38:13] I'm tired of paying rent.
[1:38:16] Now the month is coming to an end.
[1:38:19] Lord, I have this loan. I have this
[1:38:22] school fees issue. I have this trouble
[1:38:25] here. You are talking to him. You are
[1:38:29] presenting it to him.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of Lord. I have a
[1:38:33] weakness in this issue. I want to
[1:38:36] overcome this area.
[1:38:38] Lord, I get annoyed so fast.
[1:38:41] Lord, deliver from temper.
[1:38:44] You are getting concerned
[1:38:48] to be a better person
[1:38:51] and to see that you fulfill the purpose
[1:38:53] of God in
[1:38:57] Praise the name of find time to
[1:38:59] consecrate before God.
[1:39:03] Praise the name of you know Jesus was
[1:39:05] asking his disciples.
[1:39:07] You couldn't even wait with me one hour.
[1:39:12] Now look at your 24 hours.
[1:39:15] How much time do you give to God?
[1:39:19] You know you can plan. You you can
[1:39:21] actually find it out.
[1:39:26] work 10 hours,
[1:39:30] sleep,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; 6 hours or 8 hours.
[1:39:38] Breakfast
[1:39:39] 30 minutes or 1 hour,
[1:39:43] lunch
[1:39:45] 30 minutes or 1 hour.
[1:39:48] Then again supper
[1:39:50] or evening social time.
[1:39:54] with my friends
[1:39:56] and then you know there are now days
[1:39:59] applications on the phone
[1:40:02] which can estimate how much time you
[1:40:04] have spent on the phone the whole week
[1:40:06] or every day
[1:40:09] then they give you a report last week
[1:40:13] you spent a lot of time on Facebook
[1:40:17] how many hours 6 hours on Facebook
[1:40:22] WhatsApp
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; WhatsApp
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; YouTube
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; YouTube
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Tik Tok
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Tik Tok
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; then how much time on God?
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of God.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; How much time do you get with God?
[1:40:39] Okay. Every morning I spend three four
[1:40:40] minutes
[1:40:43] when I'm going to eat I spend one one
[1:40:45] one minute to talk to God because I fear
[1:40:47] poison.
[1:40:54] You know there are some maybe you're in
[1:40:56] a restaurant
[1:40:58] maybe you're afraid of poison in your
[1:41:00] food
[1:41:02] so you can't even close your eye you're
[1:41:03] looking at the food
[1:41:06] then you bless God bless this food amen
[1:41:12] then others start eating
[1:41:15] I have not prayed oh
[1:41:20] How much time do you spend with God?
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe one minute
[1:41:26] to eat 3 minutes
[1:41:29] to pray for the food and everything
[1:41:32] to pray
[1:41:34] in the morning. You're fearing
[1:41:36] accidents.
[1:41:37] Maybe your bosses are bad.
[1:41:41] All businesses are doing bad.
[1:41:44] Maybe five minutes
[1:41:46] Even 5 minutes by the time they reach
[1:41:50] the words are over to speak.
[1:41:55] Then it comes at night.
[1:41:58] You are tired.
[1:42:01] So you do
[1:42:03] maybe you get a bad dream at night.
[1:42:06] You have not prayed. Oh Lord be merciful
[1:42:09] to me.
[1:42:11] How much time do we give to God?
[1:42:15] reading the word
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says, "One shall not
[1:42:20] live by bread alone,
[1:42:22] but by every word
[1:42:26] that comes out of the mouth."
[1:42:29] And then how much have you eaten
[1:42:32] of the word of God?
[1:42:36] Maybe I I spent one minute one
[1:42:38] scripture, one verse.
[1:42:41] The Bible does say
[1:42:44] Ah, the Lord is my shepherd.
[1:42:47] I shall not worry. Amen. Amen. And then
[1:42:51] you can be repeating the same verse
[1:42:52] every day.
[1:42:55] Why don't you move forward?
[1:42:57] Why don't you take more time?
[1:43:00] Read the Bible.
[1:43:02] Sit down.
[1:43:04] Consecrate.
[1:43:07] Jesus says, "You can't even wait for me
[1:43:09] for 1 hour.
[1:43:12] How much time do you spend with the
[1:43:13] Lord?
[1:43:15] So it depends on how much time you spend
[1:43:17] with the Lord
[1:43:20] that will measure also what comes out.
[1:43:25] You'll get little
[1:43:28] because the more time you spend in
[1:43:30] something,
[1:43:32] the more you do better in it.
[1:43:35] The Bible says where your treasures are,
[1:43:40] that's where your heart is.
[1:43:43] If it is with God, you have to spend a
[1:43:46] lot of time with God.
[1:43:49] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[1:43:53] that's exactly what's the matter with
[1:43:54] the church today
[1:43:57] in taking church crits and doggmas
[1:44:01] trying to suck off them
[1:44:05] instead of taking the word of God
[1:44:09] and enjoying the fullness of the baptism
[1:44:11] of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:14] and the things of God. Why his seed his
[1:44:18] word is seed
[1:44:21] and his word bring forth of its kind.
[1:44:26] Amen. Amen. Now in the message inter
[1:44:38] you just set it out
[1:44:42] and water it
[1:44:46] and it has to drink
[1:44:49] and drink until it gets so much
[1:44:55] it just goes to pushing. ing up
[1:45:00] drinks more than its allotted portion
[1:45:06] and it swells out
[1:45:09] and it pushes out limbs
[1:45:15] and it pushes out birds.
[1:45:19] Then it pushes out leaves.
[1:45:21] Then it blossoms.
[1:45:26] Then the apples.
[1:45:28] Then it pushes again,
[1:45:30] pushes again, just keeps drinking
[1:45:35] till it just pushes out.
[1:45:39] He's talking about a tree. You've
[1:45:41] planted it
[1:45:43] by the water.
[1:45:45] God has given it roots
[1:45:48] and those roots reach out to the seabed
[1:45:50] or the river bed.
[1:45:54] It keeps on pulling water.
[1:45:57] And as it pulls that water,
[1:45:59] it becomes its lifeline.
[1:46:02] And as it keeps on drinking,
[1:46:05] it brings a a branch here. And then
[1:46:08] another branch here, then another branch
[1:46:10] here, then another. And then it comes,
[1:46:14] it sprouts out something like small
[1:46:16] leaves,
[1:46:18] and then they grow.
[1:46:20] Then from the leaves, the flowers come.
[1:46:24] Then the flowers the fruit come and the
[1:46:27] Bible say we shall know them by their
[1:46:29] fruit.
[1:46:31] So it is identifying himself
[1:46:35] that I'm a mango tree
[1:46:38] and then you can see the mango there.
[1:46:41] Oh, I'm an apple tree and then you can
[1:46:44] see the apple there. So what it does
[1:46:48] just keeps drinking.
[1:46:50] Even as that's what a Christian does.
[1:46:55] When you are planted in Christ Jesus,
[1:46:59] everything that you have need of
[1:47:03] in his journey
[1:47:05] is in you. When you receive the Holy
[1:47:07] Spirit
[1:47:09] and only thing you have to do
[1:47:12] is drink, drink,
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; push out, push out, drink till you can't
[1:47:20] drink no more.
[1:47:23] If you have need of divine healing,
[1:47:25] go to God's word,
[1:47:28] drink from it. Push out. have need of
[1:47:32] God, just keep drinking,
[1:47:35] pushing out. And Christ is the
[1:47:38] inexhaustible fountain of life.
[1:47:43] And you are planted in him.
[1:47:46] The only thing you have to do is drink
[1:47:49] of his goodness
[1:47:51] and push out. Whatever you have need of
[1:47:55] in this earth's journey,
[1:47:58] it's all drinking,
[1:48:00] resting, peace. It's not what you
[1:48:04] struggle
[1:48:06] and strive and pull at.
[1:48:10] You defeat the very purpose that you are
[1:48:13] representing. When you do that,
[1:48:18] Christianity
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; is not something into.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; God is not one you have to beg and cry
[1:48:28] and plead and fast and stuff and
[1:48:32] everything like that to get
[1:48:43] Certainly not. I'm not degrading a fast.
[1:48:49] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, there
[1:48:51] are sometimes when we get a a biased
[1:48:54] mindset
[1:48:57] and
[1:49:03] it's not that.
[1:49:06] Praise the name of the Lord. Just have
[1:49:08] that relationship.
[1:49:10] Take time with the word.
[1:49:13] Obey the word. Wait on the Lord. Then
[1:49:16] you see the Lord transform everything.
[1:49:20] Praise the name of the Lord. It's not
[1:49:29] let me also
[1:49:32] crucify. If you just take the word of
[1:49:35] the Lord,
[1:49:37] believe the word of God
[1:49:40] and do what the Lord tells you to do,
[1:49:43] all what the Lord has said,
[1:49:47] he will perform it. Praise the name of.
[1:49:50] So he says, I have chosen you and
[1:49:54] ordained you
[1:49:57] that you should bear fruit. And when you
[1:49:59] bear fruit, let your fruit remain.
[1:50:04] Praise the name of our Lord. Let your
[1:50:07] fruit remain.
[1:50:10] How will the fruit remain?
[1:50:13] Keep on drinking the water.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. The waters
[1:50:18] of life.
[1:50:20] Keep on believing Christ.
[1:50:22] See that your life is yielded over to
[1:50:25] him.
[1:50:27] You know, you continue depending upon
[1:50:29] God.
[1:50:31] You continue looking to God
[1:50:35] because the Bible says without him
[1:50:39] you can do nothing
[1:50:41] on your own you can't do anything
[1:50:45] in John chapter 15
[1:50:47] praise the name of our Lord John chapter
[1:50:50] 15
[1:50:52] verse four
[1:50:53] it says
[1:50:55] abide in me and I in you as the branch
[1:50:59] cannot bear fruit of itself self except
[1:51:02] it abide in the vine. No more can you
[1:51:06] except you abide in me.
[1:51:27] Praise the name of the Lord. So he says
[1:51:29] God is the husband man
[1:51:34] and then he is the vine,
[1:51:38] the true vine
[1:51:40] and we are the branches.
[1:51:44] In other words,
[1:51:46] in him.
[1:51:48] And how do you get into Christ?
[1:51:52] You get into Christ by being born again.
[1:51:56] By being baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[1:51:59] So now when you are baptized with the
[1:52:00] Holy Spirit,
[1:52:02] then you are in Christ.
[1:52:05] You are the temple of God.
[1:52:08] Now when the Holy Spirit is living in
[1:52:10] you,
[1:52:12] allow him to take charge over your life,
[1:52:16] let the Holy Spirit be the ruler of your
[1:52:19] human spirit
[1:52:22] and your human spirit. Let him subscribe
[1:52:26] to the Holy Spirit.
[1:52:29] Praise the name of the Lord. Just like
[1:52:31] this body, it has five senses.
[1:52:36] The eyes see, the nose smells, the
[1:52:40] tongue test, the ear hears, the body
[1:52:44] feels. These our earthly contact here.
[1:52:48] You will communicate with the rest of
[1:52:50] the world using.
[1:52:52] Yet there is a human spirit
[1:52:55] and that human spirit operates this
[1:52:58] human body
[1:53:01] and then this human body
[1:53:04] is operated by the human spirit.
[1:53:10] So when a person dies the human spirit
[1:53:14] the breath of life leaves that person.
[1:53:18] So you can see the person
[1:53:21] ears are there
[1:53:23] but they can't hear. There's no spirit.
[1:53:27] The eyes are there. They can't see.
[1:53:30] There's no spirit. So there is a higher
[1:53:33] form of life.
[1:53:37] Bodies.
[1:53:39] So now there's the human spirit
[1:53:42] and we get that human spirit
[1:53:45] when we get born near by our parents.
[1:53:49] But then the human spirit that we get
[1:53:53] cannot influence itself.
[1:53:59] So the scripture says in Jeremiah
[1:54:02] chapter 10
[1:54:04] and then verse 23.
[1:54:07] Oh Lord, I know that the way of man is
[1:54:11] not in himself.
[1:54:14] It's not in the man that walketh to
[1:54:16] direct his steps.
[1:54:29] That means that your human spirit
[1:54:32] cannot make his own decision.
[1:54:37] But your human spirit has to always be
[1:54:41] influenced.
[1:54:44] So then what influences your human
[1:54:49] and then the Bible tells us
[1:54:52] in 1 Corinthians chapter 2,
[1:54:56] 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[1:55:00] and then we can read in verse 10
[1:55:04] up to verse 13.
[1:55:08] He says,
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; let us start from verse 11.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; For what man knoweth the things of man
[1:55:16] save the spirit of man which is in him?
[1:55:19] Even so the things of God knows no man
[1:55:22] but the spirit of God.
[1:55:37] So he says it's the spirit of man,
[1:55:41] the human spirit that's not the things
[1:55:44] of man,
[1:55:46] but even the things of God is only the
[1:55:49] spirit of God.
[1:55:51] Then verse 12 says, "Now we have
[1:55:54] received not the spirit of the world,
[1:55:59] but the spirit which is of God,
[1:56:04] that we might know the things which are
[1:56:06] freely given to us.
[1:56:11] Praise the name of our Lord." So the
[1:56:13] spirit of the world is the spirit of the
[1:56:16] devil. So now we have our human spirit
[1:56:21] but outside of us there's the spirit of
[1:56:24] God and in the spirit of the world. So
[1:56:28] the spirit of God would desire to
[1:56:31] influence you
[1:56:33] or the spirit of the world would
[1:56:36] influence you and our first birth.
[1:56:41] We are born as sinners in this world.
[1:56:45] So the devil takes a hold of us
[1:56:46] immediately.
[1:56:49] He influences our thinking. He
[1:56:52] influences our decision making. He
[1:56:54] influences what we desire.
[1:56:57] So the moment we are born here on earth,
[1:57:01] our human spirit
[1:57:03] are bound by the spirit of the world
[1:57:07] and the human spirit
[1:57:09] has affections also.
[1:57:12] senses.
[1:57:14] The way the body has five senses,
[1:57:18] even the spirit of man, the human spirit
[1:57:22] has five senses.
[1:57:24] There is a sense of affection.
[1:57:28] There is a sense of consciousness.
[1:57:32] There is a sense of reasoning.
[1:57:35] There's a sense of imagination
[1:57:39] and a sense of memory.
[1:57:43] So now when you are bound by the devil
[1:57:47] then your affections
[1:57:49] will be of the devil
[1:57:52] things of the world the lust of the
[1:57:54] flesh the lust of the earth pride of
[1:57:58] life bound
[1:58:01] praise the name of our lord. So when the
[1:58:03] gospel comes
[1:58:06] is to come to liberate you
[1:58:09] from the bondage of Satan
[1:58:12] that your human spirit
[1:58:15] is released from the power of darkness
[1:58:19] that you can leave all the wicked things
[1:58:22] of the world
[1:58:24] and then your human spirit
[1:58:27] turns unto God.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So now when
[1:58:31] your human spirit
[1:58:34] turns unto God,
[1:58:36] it is the spirit of God
[1:58:38] that guides you that influences you. The
[1:58:43] Bible says as many as are led by the
[1:58:46] spirit of God,
[1:58:49] they are the children of God. Why? You
[1:58:52] surrendered your human spirit
[1:58:55] under the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:58] Holy Spirit together with your human
[1:59:01] spirit. Let us go to Romans chapter 8.
[1:59:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Verse 14.
[1:59:10] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:59:13] God, they are the sons of God.
[1:59:20] For you have not received a spirit of
[1:59:23] bondage again to fear, but you have
[1:59:25] received a spirit of adoption whereby we
[1:59:28] cry, "Aba, Father,
[1:59:45] so the spirit of God
[1:59:48] makes you to realize
[1:59:50] I am the son of God. So I call upon the
[1:59:54] name of the Lord.
[1:59:56] I depend upon God. I take time to read
[2:00:00] his word. I take time to obey his word.
[2:00:03] I take time to do things that please
[2:00:05] him.
[2:00:06] Then he says, "And the Holy Spirit
[2:00:10] bears witness
[2:00:14] bears witness with our human spirit that
[2:00:18] we are the children of God.
[2:00:25] Praise the name of our Lord." We need to
[2:00:28] get into that relationship.
[2:00:31] Now, when you get into that relationship
[2:00:34] that your human spirit
[2:00:36] acknowledges,
[2:00:39] accepts
[2:00:41] the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[2:00:45] and they talk the same thing. They have
[2:00:48] the same testimony,
[2:00:50] have the same witness,
[2:00:52] then your human spirit
[2:00:55] will stop going after the things of the
[2:00:58] world,
[2:01:00] but your human spirit will desire the
[2:01:04] things of God.
[2:01:06] because of the Holy Spirit that dwells
[2:01:09] in us.
[2:01:12] So then your human spirit
[2:01:15] under subjection of the Holy Spirit,
[2:01:20] you'll start manifesting,
[2:01:24] the life of Jesus Christ.
[2:01:26] Praise the name of our Lord, it's all
[2:01:28] about obedience.
[2:01:31] Hear the word, obey the word. Then he
[2:01:35] says, you shall abide in my love.
[2:01:39] Praise the name of the Lord. Let us go
[2:01:41] to Matthew chapter 24.
[2:01:45] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[2:01:47] scripture says,
[2:01:51] Matthew 24 and then verse 12.
[2:01:55] And because iniquity shall abound,
[2:01:59] the love of many shall works.
[2:02:14] Matthew 24:12
[2:02:28] He says, "Iniquity shall abound."
[2:02:33] So your human spirit is taken over by
[2:02:37] the world spirit.
[2:02:41] So then you do things which are
[2:02:43] contrary.
[2:02:46] No love of God. The Bible says if you
[2:02:49] love the world, the love of God is not
[2:02:52] in you.
[2:02:55] So you need to make sure that you see
[2:02:58] that you hate the things of the world
[2:03:02] that the spirit of God have preeminence
[2:03:05] in your life.
[2:03:07] And when the spirit of God has charge in
[2:03:09] your life,
[2:03:11] you will bear the fruit of the spirit.
[2:03:15] Praise the name of our Lord. It will be
[2:03:17] something that is in your life
[2:03:19] automatically.
[2:03:22] You force yourself to
[2:03:25] but it's alive.
[2:03:27] Praise the name of the Lord. You don't
[2:03:29] think about it. It just comes there
[2:03:34] because there is a word of God that
[2:03:36] lives in you.
[2:03:38] You know the way the Bible say in Psalms
[2:03:41] chapter one
[2:03:43] that you shall be like a tree
[2:03:46] that is planted
[2:03:49] by the rivers of water
[2:03:53] that bears its fruit in season.
[2:03:57] So you are drinking from the river
[2:04:00] and then it comes then it brings its
[2:04:03] manifestation
[2:04:06] as you connect with Christ.
[2:04:08] His life is on display in your life. His
[2:04:12] life is on display in your life.
[2:04:15] Praise the name of Lord. So let our
[2:04:18] fruit remain.
[2:04:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Avoid the
[2:04:24] things of the world.
[2:04:26] Avoid the things that are contrary to
[2:04:28] the word of God.
[2:04:31] Avoid bad companies.
[2:04:35] Your fruit should remain.
[2:04:38] Praise the name of God. Now in the
[2:04:40] message influence,
[2:04:43] he says so many today
[2:04:48] you take a family of people
[2:04:51] that will start going to church
[2:04:55] and God will heal the little family.
[2:05:00] He will bless them and give them the
[2:05:02] Holy Spirit in their life. The little
[2:05:07] children will pray around the table.
[2:05:11] They will pray before they go to bed.
[2:05:15] Mother and father will join hands and
[2:05:18] pray.
[2:05:20] And as long as they continue like that,
[2:05:25] they will stay a family.
[2:05:29] Praise the name of the Lord. Says as
[2:05:31] long as they continue,
[2:05:34] they will stay a family.
[2:05:37] You're not too busy to come to church.
[2:05:40] You're not too busy to pray.
[2:05:44] You're not too busy to read your Bible.
[2:05:47] Too busy to read to not talk about God.
[2:05:51] He says you'll stay.
[2:05:54] But see how the devil comes now.
[2:05:57] He says
[2:05:59] first thing you know
[2:06:01] they didn't have nothing.
[2:06:04] an old junk car
[2:06:08] maybe riding around in
[2:06:12] or maybe walking
[2:06:15] and they keep their time.
[2:06:18] Praise the name of our Lord. But
[2:06:20] sometimes when the things accumulate
[2:06:22] then the love works cold.
[2:06:27] That means there's a replacement.
[2:06:31] The love you had either has been taken
[2:06:34] by the car,
[2:06:37] the love you had of God,
[2:06:40] whether he has been taken by the things
[2:06:41] you possess,
[2:06:44] the love of God you had,
[2:06:47] whether has been taken by everything you
[2:06:49] think about.
[2:06:52] I just don't have enough time.
[2:06:56] There's a brother who said,
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; now I'm not saying the same.
[2:07:02] But it is true. If
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; you don't have time,
[2:07:06] when you fall sick and you're bedridden,
[2:07:08] will you have that time
[2:07:12] to go to work to go and do other things?
[2:07:16] But you're just there bedridden.
[2:07:19] Everything is cut off.
[2:07:22] You're on the bed very sick.
[2:07:24] You don't need to remember God on the
[2:07:26] bed like that.
[2:07:28] Even when you are well,
[2:07:30] see that what belongs to God, you give
[2:07:32] to God.
[2:07:35] You give him your life. You give him
[2:07:37] your time. You give him your resources.
[2:07:41] Be faithful.
[2:07:43] Praise the name over. Don't take the
[2:07:45] mind of the devil.
[2:07:47] You know the devil thinks that we serve
[2:07:49] God because of conditions or
[2:07:50] circumstance.
[2:07:54] But should not be like that.
[2:07:57] Praise the name of the Lord. So he says
[2:07:59] when that family is in that state, they
[2:08:01] continue.
[2:08:05] Then finally they get a good car,
[2:08:08] a better home. And the first thing you
[2:08:11] know,
[2:08:13] then they want to go to what the world
[2:08:16] calls a better class.
[2:08:29] high society
[2:08:32] and then they associate with that.
[2:08:38] You know when when you are very poor you
[2:08:40] don't have time to go to the lion's club
[2:08:44] or golf club
[2:08:50] they sell there soda many times the
[2:08:53] price of the normal one
[2:08:56] things of golf are very expensive
[2:09:00] they come driving
[2:09:02] carrying their bags
[2:09:05] will you come with the border
[2:09:09] So you must come with a status there
[2:09:11] also
[2:09:13] come with people are going to carry for
[2:09:14] you
[2:09:16] put on you know designer shoes
[2:09:20] [Music]
[2:09:21] designer belt
[2:09:24] designer cape
[2:09:26] designer t-shirt
[2:09:34] so it takes its own.
[2:09:38] So then when he becomes into that
[2:09:42] they move into a different neighborhood
[2:09:46] and in there they find out
[2:09:51] they become influenced by the wrong
[2:09:54] influence.
[2:09:59] Yeah. Because those people don't have
[2:10:00] time for God.
[2:10:02] like this golf club golf
[2:10:07] or sports rallies
[2:10:11] they don't have time for God
[2:10:13] and then when they are meeting in the
[2:10:15] evening
[2:10:17] drinking
[2:10:19] smoking
[2:10:20] doing all things which are not right and
[2:10:23] then you've got an influence
[2:10:28] this is the one
[2:10:30] mayor even yesterday with
[2:10:32] minister
[2:10:34] your talk is high
[2:10:38] then you see you know the Bible says
[2:10:42] cares of life
[2:10:45] and cares of life all go through the
[2:10:47] things
[2:10:49] you need the food you need the clothes
[2:10:52] you need where to reside you struggle to
[2:10:54] get those things you struggle to get
[2:10:57] those things
[2:10:59] now when you finish of life is no
[2:11:01] trouble.
[2:11:05] Then it comes the riches of life.
[2:11:08] You have possessed enough.
[2:11:11] Satan is also there.
[2:11:13] Now when you have enough,
[2:11:16] now you go to the pleasures of life.
[2:11:20] That's when you can afford,
[2:11:23] you know, to spend money on something
[2:11:25] too small.
[2:11:29] You spend that money
[2:11:32] And it takes your time and everything.
[2:11:35] So even these people put themselves like
[2:11:38] that.
[2:11:41] They had the fruit.
[2:11:43] The spirit was in their family.
[2:11:46] The Holy Spirit. But the fruit would not
[2:11:50] remain
[2:11:52] because of wrong influences.
[2:11:56] It can be at your place of work. It can
[2:11:59] be your neighbors.
[2:12:01] It can be some of your friends who have
[2:12:02] come around
[2:12:05] and when you associate with them your
[2:12:08] fruit doesn't remain
[2:12:11] but he says I have chosen you and
[2:12:14] ordained you that you bear fruit. Now
[2:12:18] when you bear fruit God wants your fruit
[2:12:21] to remain.
[2:12:24] Praise the name of the Lord. He wants
[2:12:26] your fruit to remain.
[2:12:29] He wants to come to your tree that he
[2:12:31] can find fruit to eat.
[2:12:34] Not like the other tree
[2:12:37] with leaves
[2:12:39] but no fruit. God wants to find your
[2:12:42] fruit.
[2:12:43] So he says you must always stay where
[2:12:45] the kingdom of God is,
[2:12:50] where the glory of God is pouring out.
[2:12:55] Stay where you can be spiritually fed
[2:12:57] day and night.
[2:13:01] Praise the name of our Lord. You need to
[2:13:04] see
[2:13:06] that I need to be in the services of the
[2:13:08] Lord
[2:13:10] for my spiritual good.
[2:13:13] Praise the name of the Lord to keep
[2:13:14] alive. You know what does what does the
[2:13:17] Lord want me to do?
[2:13:19] to keep on reading my Bible. I need to
[2:13:22] keep on reading my message books. I need
[2:13:25] to keep on waiting on the Lord,
[2:13:28] praying to the Lord, Lord, help me.
[2:13:32] Lord, guide me. Lord, direct me because
[2:13:36] the devil is still fighting.
[2:13:39] Praise the name of Lord now in the Sian
[2:13:41] church age.
[2:13:44] Sad. Yes. In Revelation 3:2,
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit was telling them,
[2:13:52] "Be watchful
[2:13:56] and strengthen
[2:13:58] the things which remain
[2:14:01] that are ready to die,
[2:14:04] who have not found your works perfect
[2:14:07] before God."
[2:14:10] So then he says, "Be watchful.
[2:14:15] and strengthen
[2:14:17] the things which remain
[2:14:20] that are ready to die.
[2:14:22] Now the ideas
[2:14:25] expressed in these two words
[2:14:28] watchful
[2:14:30] and strengthen
[2:14:32] are these
[2:14:35] to watch.
[2:14:37] It contains not only the idea of being
[2:14:40] awake but to be alert.
[2:14:47] to be otherwise instinct. Danger and
[2:14:49] loss.
[2:14:56] To strengthen
[2:14:58] means more than just to give strength.
[2:15:03] It means to fix
[2:15:06] and establish for permanency.
[2:15:12] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[2:15:15] see that our fruit.
[2:15:18] What we have received of the Lord, let
[2:15:21] us not lose any.
[2:15:24] Let us not lose any ground to the devil,
[2:15:28] your time to pray, your time to
[2:15:31] meditate,
[2:15:33] your time to read the word of God,
[2:15:36] that the devil doesn't take any ground.
[2:15:39] You know, because when the devil comes
[2:15:41] closer to the ground that you've been
[2:15:44] to,
[2:15:45] then he's trying to shift.
[2:15:48] That's why those western countries
[2:15:52] or Russia
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; is making sure they don't bring their
[2:15:55] their missiles along its borders
[2:16:01] because easily they can push you out.
[2:16:05] So they make sure
[2:16:07] stay there.
[2:16:09] Let us have a buffer zone around.
[2:16:14] Praise the name of our Lord. But now
[2:16:16] most of us I don't know if Satan has not
[2:16:19] already taken our buffer zone.
[2:16:23] You have taken your buffer zone.
[2:16:27] You say I don't go to disco.
[2:16:30] You say I don't go to disco.
[2:16:33] But on your phone you listen to disco
[2:16:34] music.
[2:16:37] You're already there in the disco.
[2:16:41] I don't go to to film holes.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; But you have these things here.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; You feed dirt things.
[2:16:51] He has already bleached.
[2:16:54] It's just there.
[2:16:58] How will your fruit remain?
[2:17:01] The Bible says
[2:17:03] because iniquity shall abound.
[2:17:07] The love of many shall works.
[2:17:11] So how much do you love God?
[2:17:15] Praise the name of the Lord. How much do
[2:17:17] you love God?
[2:17:20] Look at your time you spend. Praise the
[2:17:23] name of Lord. How much time do you give
[2:17:25] to God in your life?
[2:17:28] You can know I spend time on this. I
[2:17:30] spend time on this. and spend time on
[2:17:32] it. How about the message?
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. When did
[2:17:38] you get a message book
[2:17:41] and read it and completed it? How long
[2:17:45] did it take you?
[2:17:48] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[2:17:50] take your Bible
[2:17:52] and honestly pray,
[2:17:55] reading the Bible, asking God
[2:17:58] to find the mind of God in this area.
[2:18:03] When did you last do that?
[2:18:06] The weaknesses that you have. How often
[2:18:09] do you call on the name of the Lord?
[2:18:13] Deliver me from this weakness.
[2:18:15] Deliver me from this failure.
[2:18:18] How much time do you spend with the
[2:18:20] Lord?
[2:18:22] Praise the name of the Lord. You know,
[2:18:24] you need to check yourself.
[2:18:28] My fruit
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; is it there or it has already been
[2:18:32] eaten?
[2:18:34] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[2:18:36] know when the devil was attacking the
[2:18:38] bride tree,
[2:18:40] God is attacking the fruit.
[2:18:44] So when the fruit was eaten,
[2:18:47] then he came to the leaves
[2:18:50] and the fruit is your identity.
[2:18:55] And now if you don't have a fruit,
[2:19:00] they will get you in a group of people
[2:19:02] who are cursing.
[2:19:07] You think these ones fear God
[2:19:10] also among them cuz you're enjoying the
[2:19:12] dark
[2:19:14] identity.
[2:19:16] When you got people doing bad things,
[2:19:19] they think you're also their client
[2:19:23] because there's no identity.
[2:19:26] They're not afraid of you.
[2:19:29] They can do anything they want to do.
[2:19:31] Anything they want to say,
[2:19:34] identity
[2:19:40] fruit.
[2:19:42] So the the worms ate the fruit.
[2:19:46] And some people they can be without the
[2:19:50] fruit
[2:19:51] but then they have the leaves.
[2:19:54] Come to church
[2:19:56] fellowship
[2:19:58] those are leaves. But if the worm has
[2:20:01] eaten your fruit
[2:20:03] is coming to eat your your leaves.
[2:20:07] And when it eats the leaves it becomes
[2:20:10] hard to come to church.
[2:20:13] It becomes hard to wait on the Lord.
[2:20:16] It becomes hard to read the message book
[2:20:20] and you just like ah I don't know the
[2:20:23] things or even when you start reading
[2:20:26] your mind goes off.
[2:20:29] That's the devil but we are called the
[2:20:33] Bible told us we have been chosen.
[2:20:37] We have been ordained
[2:20:39] to bear fruit. Praise the name of our
[2:20:42] Lord. So how much fruit are you bearing?
[2:20:46] Praise the name of our Lord. He says
[2:20:48] that your fruit
[2:20:50] should remain.
[2:20:52] Let us finish. Praise the name of our
[2:20:54] Lord. In Ephesians chapter 5
[2:20:58] and then verse 9,
[2:21:01] the Bible says, "For the fruit of the
[2:21:04] spirit is in all goodness and
[2:21:06] righteousness and truth."
[2:21:09] Ephesians 5:9,
[2:21:13] [Music]
[2:21:23] proving what is acceptable unto the
[2:21:26] Lord,
[2:21:30] and have no fellowship with the
[2:21:32] unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
[2:21:36] reprove them.
[2:21:50] He says, "Have no fellowship,
[2:21:55] the unfruitful works of darkness.
[2:22:00] See that you don't take interest in
[2:22:02] them.
[2:22:05] See that you don't give them room.
[2:22:09] But reprove them,
[2:22:13] reject them. For it is a shame even to
[2:22:16] speak of those things which are done of
[2:22:19] them in the secret.
[2:22:31] Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[2:22:33] reject them. You don't desire them.
[2:22:37] Praise the name of our Lord. You want to
[2:22:39] have your personal relationship with the
[2:22:41] Holy Spirit,
[2:22:43] the Holy Spirit can take over your life.
[2:22:46] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[2:22:49] Hebrews 12 verse1 and verse 2
[2:22:54] the Bible says
[2:22:58] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[2:23:01] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[2:23:04] let us lay aside every weight and the
[2:23:08] sin which does easily beset us and let
[2:23:10] us run with patience the race that is
[2:23:13] set before us.
[2:23:39] looking unto Jesus, the author and the
[2:23:42] finish of our faith, who for the joy
[2:23:44] that was set before him,
[2:23:46] endured the cross, despising the shame,
[2:23:50] and he sat down at the right hand of the
[2:23:52] throne of God.
[2:24:21] Amen. Amen. It says looking unto Jesus,
[2:24:26] continuous looking
[2:24:29] because he's the one who starts our
[2:24:31] faith
[2:24:32] and he's the one who perfects it, the
[2:24:35] one who brings it to completion.
[2:24:38] So just have that continuous look to
[2:24:40] Christ,
[2:24:43] you know, a continuous love of God,
[2:24:47] fellowship of God,
[2:24:50] continuous obedience,
[2:24:52] you know, continuous reading the word,
[2:24:55] continuous meditating upon the word,
[2:24:58] continuous hearing the word,
[2:25:00] you just continue with him.
[2:25:04] as you keep on looking unto him
[2:25:07] like that song, turn your eyes unto
[2:25:10] Jesus.
[2:25:12] And the more you turn your eyes to
[2:25:14] Jesus,
[2:25:16] it says the things of the world will
[2:25:20] become strangely dim.
[2:25:26] You even start wondering what are these
[2:25:28] people talking about?
[2:25:32] People still
[2:25:34] they do those things then there are
[2:25:36] those who know where they do them from
[2:25:40] this
[2:25:42] but for you they are dim
[2:25:46] you've cut off yourself from the things
[2:25:48] of the world
[2:25:50] because you desire more of God
[2:25:54] and the more of God you desire
[2:25:57] you are drinking you're drinking and as
[2:26:00] you keep on drinking you manifest that
[2:26:03] which was ordained in your life.
[2:26:06] Praise the name of our Lord. You bear
[2:26:08] the fruit of the spirit
[2:26:11] not in little quantity.
[2:26:14] But you know the quant the measure has
[2:26:16] to continue
[2:26:18] just like this scripture here
[2:26:21] it says the more you look to him.
[2:26:25] You know in 2 Corinthians 3:18,
[2:26:31] praise the name of our Lord,
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; and he says,
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; "But we all
[2:26:38] with an open face,
[2:26:46] beholding as in the glass the glory of
[2:26:49] the Lord."
[2:26:52] So now you are looking in the glass of
[2:26:55] God
[2:26:57] which is the word of God.
[2:27:00] You are allowing the word influence you.
[2:27:04] The word influences your affection.
[2:27:07] The word influences your consciousness.
[2:27:11] The word influences your memory.
[2:27:15] The word influences your reasoning.
[2:27:19] Your decisions
[2:27:21] are based on the word of God.
[2:27:24] Then he says, "You are changed
[2:27:28] in the same image
[2:27:31] from glory
[2:27:33] to glory by the spirit of the Lord."
[2:27:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Like that
[2:27:39] rivers of water, it says it bears
[2:27:43] his fruit.
[2:27:46] Whose fruit? Christ is fruit.
[2:27:49] In Christ season
[2:27:51] when you keep on looking to the word you
[2:27:55] are changed you are transformed
[2:27:59] your mind is changed your speech is
[2:28:02] changed your action is changed and then
[2:28:05] they see the person is not like us
[2:28:10] because there is a power of
[2:28:11] transformation
[2:28:13] that works from within you
[2:28:16] and brings you to the image of the Lord
[2:28:17] Jesus.
[2:28:19] Praise the name of our Lord. We should
[2:28:21] desire to be like Jesus.
[2:28:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Be like
[2:28:26] Jesus Christ all your lifetime.
[2:28:30] Be like Jesus Christ. May God bless you
[2:28:32] so.
[2:28:34] Amen. Amen.
[2:28:37] We shall do a dedication
[2:28:41] just after the service
[2:28:43] leads us into worship.
[2:28:48] Let us sing that song to be like Jesus.
[2:28:52] If you can come after to be like Jesus,
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; I want to be like him.

[2:47:13] She's really looking at me.
[2:47:17] Let us pray.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:47:22] Christ,
[2:47:25] &gt;&gt; thank you for this baby that you've
[2:47:26] given the family of our brother and our
[2:47:28] sister.
[2:47:32] We dedicate this baby into your hands.
[2:47:37] We pray that the grace of God may come
[2:47:39] upon her life.
[2:47:42] your blessings,
[2:47:45] your protection.
[2:47:47] And Lord, we pray in the name of Jesus
[2:47:49] Christ
[2:47:51] that Lord, you may give the ability to
[2:47:53] the father and the mother
[2:47:55] to raise this child in the fear of the
[2:47:57] Lord.
[2:47:59] You also give them Lord, you may open
[2:48:01] doors for them to get incomes that can
[2:48:04] raise the wellbeing of this child.
[2:48:10] We pray the baby may be a joy to their
[2:48:12] family
[2:48:15] and Lord may watch over this baby's
[2:48:16] life.
[2:48:18] Revoke the cough that's tormenting her

[2:48:23] that Lord you may heal this child. Lord

[2:48:27] child from all negative spirits from all
[2:48:30] powers of darkness. Lord that wherever
[2:48:33] the family may be Lord may always watch
