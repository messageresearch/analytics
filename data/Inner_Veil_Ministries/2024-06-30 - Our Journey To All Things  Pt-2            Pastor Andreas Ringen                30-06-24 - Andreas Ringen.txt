Praise God. I first invited the ministers, the pastors, the the old time pastors. I've seen them always hide behind there. You come from. [Music] So these are brothers that have ministered with us over the years. And the Lord has used them. Amen. In many various ways they are very few here. So I'll allow them one by one to mention the name and the church. You don't give a preacher time to say two words. The anointing may come down upon him. God bless you. God bless you. Wilson Church. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Sir [Applause] from God bless you. [Music] [Applause] Moses M church. May you get this. The good Lord bless you all. Michael Casamba from Inavia Church. Amen. Amen. God bless you. I thank you God. Then we are going to ask the rest of the ministers whom the Lord has found and has deployed them on the field. You just woke up here. [Applause] All of us behind here. [Applause] We thank God for this. [Applause] The Lord has blessed them. They are not ashamed of the gospel. Amen. Amen. and neither they ashamed of the messenger. Amen. So we certainly appreciate them my friend. Praise the Lord. So these are brothers that we work with in the different areas. The Lord has been fishing them out. one man at a time. And they go looking for one another. Amen. And every day the multiplier effect is so big. So we pray one time we are going to get them here and their and their flocks. We don't know where we shall fit, but we shall try. Let us wave to each other from here to there. Amen. God bless you so much. These are the men you have to pray for all the time. They are waving to you. Have you seen? Okay, you pray for them. So, we don't have time to mention them name by name. They are not few. But may the Lord bless them. AMEN. AMEN. [Applause] PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. I encouraged brother James. I encouraged brother James that on your church platform he should be posting wherever we go. Sometimes we see brother James back in church but we may not know where he has been through the week. That man goes to Nakasola, goes to Bali, goes to Chiboga and on Sunday he comes here like he has been nowhere. But the Lord is giving him grace. Amen. Amen. We appreciate brothers like SA and different ones who have spent their time. Amen. And trying to reach out for the others. God bless you so much. Amen. Amen. So we do not have much time and uh we want to get ready to hear from the Lord again. The Lord knows which angle he wants us to go. You know, sometimes I get to the pulpit and I don't know what I'm going to preach. And then I have two services sometimes. And then when I come down here, you hear the singing or the direction or the need of the people, you just go to another service again. And sometimes in between there something happens that you go another angling. Like yesterday when I was preaching the funeral I just decided to I read the scriptures but after reading the scripture I found out I could not use it. The speakers went bad. Amen. But finally I discovered God was taking me another angle and I just decided to speak to the people and I believe there was somebody God who was talking. Amen. So God bless you as we welcome our brother. Let's stand up and give the Lord a hand of praise as our brother comes. Amen. Praise God. You're welcome my brother. God bless you so much. Amen. [Applause] Christ. Amen. Amen. These are wonderful God. Amen. Amen. These are wonderful God. Wonderful people. Amen. God bless you. What a what a privilege to see uh that God is uh um uh still using and speaking to people. I come from Germany and we have in Germany we have 85 million people 85 million I think double size of population than you have in Uganda. And we have only about a thousand believers. We have only about 10 to 12 churches. You see how that stirs my heart when I see so many ministers. We have in whole Germany we have not so many ministers and that is gathered here together. So, so God is good to us. Amen. God is good to you. Never take that for granted. It's just God's grace to us. Amen. Amen. Amen. So, uh, may the Lord bless you. Amen. We just straight want to go back into the word. That's why we are here. Amen. Amen. And as this morning I was just uh drawn to total aside. Amen. I think you have uh seen and felt that. So the Lord knows and we are so happy that we serve a living God. Amen. Amen. We want to go back to the same scripture. We want to read uh you want to read uh or maybe we start with Genesis 12. Amen. Amen. As we want to look in the life of Gideon, of Abraham, not of Gideon, but of Abraham. But it's just the generation that is here. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. the generation of Jesus Christ. It began with Abraham alpha and now we come to the omega. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's the same as it was with the alpha. So is it now in the omega? Amen. Alpha and omega is the same. That's why you can put your life in that principle of of Abraham. what happened happened to Abraham is happening to the elect bride of Jesus Christ and the greatest thing at the end of Abraham's life was when God tested him. So the greatest thing in your life before going home is that God will test you and by that test he will prove who you really are. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I trust I can speak like this to you. Amen. Even if you are just uh only not so many years familiar with the things, but I believe there's workers, we call them the 11 hour workers, they get the same salary. They hear the same sermons. Amen. Amen. And what some of us have waited for so many years to get to it, now you are confronted with it. Amen. Amen. Amen. May the Lord bless you richly. Amen. Amen. So don't feel it strange. I say that at home and he also I don't want to preach to um actually you know we know one another from before the foundation of the world if you give it a little time you find out it is true. Amen. Let's turn to Genesis 12. Amen. As we have we just want to read and then Genesis 15 also again or Genesis 22 maybe. Genesis 12. Here it starts with Abraham. Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee." Amen. Amen. As Bible readers, we know Paul would say later that Abraham were looking for a city. Here God told him, "Go in a land that I will show thee." Abraham, Paul said later that Abraham were looking for a city. Amen. Amen. Amen. And you're with me? Amen. Amen. So it was a land and yet it was a city. Amen. So it was just when God started with Abraham, he gave him a bright view. As just things went closer, he get more focused on what it was. Finally, he came to recognize that he was a part of that city. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. That is our journey. Okay. And then let's go to Genesis 22. Genesis 22. We want to read again. Uh after these things. Amen. Amen. And as a prophet would let us know can give you the quote for it. Brother Rana would say we are brought to a test. The seed of Abraham today is brought to that test. Will we take God's words or we take what man said about we are brought to a test. Amen. Amen. Like Abraham is brought to a test. After these things, it came to pass that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Abraham, and he said, Behold, here I am. And he said, Now take now thine son, thine only son Isaac, in whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon the one of the mountains which I will show thee of. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Let us pray together. Heavenly Father, Father, we have read your word again, Father, and now we just pray that you open up that word to us. Anoint thy word, I pray. Anoint thy servant as we stand here. Anoint the people, Father, the speaker and the hearer, that we will hear from you, oh God. We commit ourselves into your hands, the service into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. We could read much more. Amen. But I think we have read this morning already a little bit and we want to uh we want to continue with that thought on uh on uh uh Abraham's or our journey to all things. Amen. Amen. We believe we are according to uh promise. We are heir of all things. Amen. Amen. And now we are on our way to all things to the to the situation where all things are possible as Abraham was there as Abraham was on his way on his journey. Amen. And and so wonderful how God starts the journey. The Bible said it it started not even with a vision. It's just started that God talks spoke to Abraham and you know God knows h how he how he needs to talk to you that you are listening. Is that right? God knows exactly how he has to talk to you. So God was talking to Abraham in a way that Abraham understood him. And God said, "Okay, Abraham, leave your father and your mother. Leave your denomination." You know, Abraham was busy in idolatry. His father was making little idols for worship. Abraham's father was an idol worshipper. So they did make idols and Abraham was helping him and ONE DAY GOD JUST SPOKE TO HIM. Is it not our testimony? One day God just spoke to us AND GOD KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO GET YOUR ATTENTION. He knew exactly how to get Abraham's attention. How God spoke to him, we don't know. God can speak in different ways. But finally God get his attention. So he was listening. AND SO THIS IS OUR STORY, isn't it? WHO CAN SAY THAT GOD one day spoke to him? Amen. Did God spoke to you? I trust God spoke to you that you are not here because of men. That you are here because God brought you here. Yes, GOD IS USING MEN. GOD SPEAKS THROUGH MEN. GOD HAS A VARIOUS WAY. GOD SPEAK CAN EVEN SPEAK THROUGH A DONKEY. WE remember the days of Ba Ba Baum. GOD COULD SPEAK THROUGH A DONKEY TO BALAM. SO GOD CAN SPEAK HOWEVER HE WANTS to get your attention. So that's our story. I think this is where we ALL CAN SAY THAT'S WHY WE are here because God spoke to us. Amen. The way started AND LOOK HOW THE WAY STARTED WITH ABRAHAM AND JUST ENJOY how God is doing things. GOD IS NOT GIVING YOU EVERYTHING FROM THE BEGINNING. BECAUSE GOD KNOW EXACTLY YOU CANNOT HANDLE AS A LITTLE CHILD. YOU CANNOT GIVE HIM EVERYTHING BECAUSE HE CANNOT HANDLE THINGS. SO AS YOU ARE BORN AND WE ARE WHEN YOU ARE BORN AGAIN YOU ARE A BABY IN CHRIST AND GOD KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO GIVE THINGS TO YOU, WHAT TO SPEAK TO YOU, HOW TO DEAL WITH YOU. AMEN. HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO GET YOUR DREAM. HE KNOWS WHERE YOU COME FROM. HE KNOWS YOUR PARENTS. HE KNOWS YOUR PAST. HE KNOWS YOUR GRANDPARENTS. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. SO HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO get to you, WHOM TO SEND TO YOU, WHAT TO GIVE TO YOU THAT YOUR ATTENTION IS ON IT. AMEN. Isn't that amazing that Abraham listened? ABRAHAM WAS NOT A BELIEVER. ABRAHAM CAME FROM A FAMILY OF IDOLATRY AND YET GOD GET HIS ATTENTION. It's it LOOKS SO EASY. GOD SPOKE TO HIM. DID GOD SPOKE TO YOU IN THIS HOUR? WHO CAN SAY GOD SPOKE TO ME? I trust everybody can say that. Amen. Then God is pulling you. Amen. SO WHEN GOD AND GOD STARTS, THIS IS OUR STORY. THIS WAS ABRAHAM'S STORY. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS HE'S DOING TO SARAH AND ABRAHAM. He said coming along THIS WAY JUST LIKE HE PROMISED TO DO TO THEIR SEEDS and he HAS DONE IT. I CAN PROVE IT EXACTLY THE STEPS THAT ABRAHAM TOOK. AMEN. NOW LOOK WHERE HE'S AT HERE. WHEN THIS GOD COME AND TALK TO HIM. AMEN. GOD COME AND TALK TO HIM. GOD TOLD HIM ABRAHAM GET OUT OF YOUR COUNTRY. SEPARATE FROM YOUR FATHER AND AMEN. AND AND THEN GO INTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW THEE. AND WE KNOW ALL THE END OF ABRAHAM. You know WHAT IT REALLY WAS. BUT IF HE WOULD TELL ABRAHAM EVERYTHING FROM THE BEGINNING, ABRAHAM COULD NOT HAVE HANDLED IT. IF GOD WOULD TELL YOU FROM THE BEGINNING WHAT HIS PLAN IS with you, YOU COULDN'T handle it. Amen. WHEN THE MESSAGE COME YOUR WAY, WHEN THE MESSAGE SPEAKS TO YOU, IT shows it shows it shows that you are special. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. IT SHOWS THAT GOD HAS A SPECIAL PURPOSE WITH YOU. HE DOES NOT SEND THE MESSAGE TO EVERYONE. [Applause] THAT'S WHY THE MESSAGE IS NOT SPEAKING TO EVERYONE. IS IT RIGHT? WE HAVE 78 BILLION PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. And look AND LOOK HOW MANY HOW LITTLE HOW FEW PEOPLE THE MESSAGE means something to them. Yes. IT MAY BE ONE IN A MILLION. [Applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. YOU UNDERSTAND? THERE WAS, AS A PROPHET WOULD SAY, THERE WAS THAT GREAT UH THAT THERE WAS THAT GREAT uh chicken barn. [Applause] WHERE THERE WERE A LOT OF EGGS. AMEN. A lot of chicken eggs and THERE WAS ONLY ONE EGG. SOMEHOW IT GET THERE. Somehow the eagle egg get there. [Applause] The eagle egg DID NOT PUT HIMSELF THERE. YOU DID NOT PUT YOURSELF WHERE YOU ARE. God ordained you. YOU COULDN'T CHOOSE THE COUNTRY where you were born in. You couldn't choose the gender that you were born with. It's God's choice. IT'S NOT YOUR DECISION. Is it right? SO WE HAD SO MANY EGGS AND JUST ONE EAGLE EGG. NOW WATCH NOW AS AS AS ALL EGGS GET get finally uh you know uh the babies came out [Applause] and NOW THEY WERE SLOWLY GROWING TOGETHER. One day THE PROPHET WOULD TELL US THAT MAMA OR PAPA EAGLE KNEW THERE WAS SOMEWHERE AN EGG. AMEN. AND GOD KNEW THAT YOU WERE SOMEWHERE AND THEN THE EAGLE STARTS FLYING. AND AS THE EAGLE WERE FLYING, HE LET OUT A SCREAM, HE LET OUT A MESSAGE [Music] and only THE EAGLE WAS ATTRACTED. THE CHICKENS WHEN THE CHICKENS HEAR AN EAGLE SCREAM, THEY become afraid. Amen. And when BUT WHEN AN EAGLE HEARS an eagle scream, HE LOOKS UP BECAUSE HIS REDEMPTION IS DRAWING NIGH. THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. [Music] THIS MESSAGE IS ONLY FOR THE ELECT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. CAN YOU UNDERSTAND HOW GOD IS TALKING TO YOU or God IS SPEAKING TO YOU BECAUSE HE SENT YOU A MESSAGE AND YOU GET ATTRACTED. YOU BECOME INTERESTED IN SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU HERE IN THE TOP. YOU MAY SAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART IT'S SAYING THAT SOUNDS RIGHT. IT SOUNDS THE TRUTH. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT HERE IN THE CHURCH. YOUR BRAIN IS TOO SMALL FOR IT. BUT YOUR HEART WILL PULL YOU IN. YOUR HEART WILL SAY YES BEFORE YOUR BRAIN SAYS YES. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. AND YOU UNDERSTAND AS LONG AS WE ARE AS YOU ARE IN the in you're in around where where you not belong. Amen. EVERYTHING AROUND YOU IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU NEVER COME TO YOUR TRUE IDENTITY. THE DEVIL NEVER WANTS YOU TO UNDERSTAND YOUR TRUE IDENTITY. LIKE THE CHICKENS, THEY NEVER THEY NEVER WANT THE SMALL EAGLE TO BECOME MATURES. THEY ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP HIM SMALL. YOU KNOW WHY? CHICKENS UNDERSTAND AN EAGLE BECOMES BIG. BIG EAGLES EAT CHICKENS. [Applause] THE DEVIL UNDERSTANDS. THE DEVIL UNDERSTANDS AND YOU BECOME BIG. YOU EAT THEM. DID NOT JOSHUA AND CALEB SPEAK ABOUT THE ENEMIES IN THE PROMISED LAND? YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID? THEY ARE OUR FOOD. [Applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND YOU UNDERSTAND COMING BACK to back to the simple, God knows how to speak TO YOU. HE KNOWS HOW to get TO YOUR ATTENTION. BUT YOU UNDERSTAND AS WE KNOW THE STORY OF ABRAHAM. THIS IS OUR STORY. THIS IS MY STORY THAT I CAN IDENTIFY MYSELF. AND I KNOW THE END THAT HE HAS WILL BE THE END THAT I HAVE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THE END HE HAS IS MY END. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I WILL BE CHANGED LIKE HE WAS CHANGED. I WILL BRING FORTH THE SON LIKE HE BROUGHT FORTH THE SUN. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. GOD told him in the beginning. Sorry when I get excited. Sorry when I get excited. Amen. But something that stirs me and I'm emotional. AMEN. I BELIEVE WHEN WE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE. I believe when we are ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE WILL BE A NOISE SHOUTING AND I DECIDED MYSELF I start already with BROTHER RAM SAID BROTHER RAM SAID PRAY Lord brother Ram prayed that the prophet prayed it. HE SAID LORD HELP ME TO WORSHIP YOU ON THIS SIDE AS IF I WOULD BE ALREADY ON THE OTHER SIDE. [Applause] ON THE OTHER SIDE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK ME. SHOUTS. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SO WHEN YOU WANT SEE WHO YOU ARE, I KNOW THERE'S A TIME OF JUBILEE FOR THE CHURCH. OF SINGING A NEW SONG. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. JUST LET THE DEVIL KNOW on what side you are standing. Let the devil know on what side you are standing. Amen. Sometimes he WANT TO PUSH YOU ON THE SIDE of the loser, BUT SHOW HIM ON WHAT SIDE YOU ARE STANDING. [Applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Confuse the enemy. Confuse him like Jesus confused him. Jesus total confused them. Amen. TOTAL. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. So you CAN DO THE SAME. YOU CAN CONFUSE THE ENEMY. And you are not pretending. YOU KNOW THE END. YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WILL BE. YOU KNOW YOUR FUTURE BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR DESTINY. IF YOU KNOW YOUR DESTINY, IF YOU KNOW WHERE YOU COME FROM, YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING. [Applause] That's why we are not pretending. SATAN KNOWS EXACTLY if you are pretending or not. You cannot intimidate him. He knows exactly. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND JESUS WAS NOT INTIMIDATING. YET WHEN HE WAS ON THE CROSS, HE CRIED, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAS THOU FORSAKEN ME?" HE KNEW WHO he was. [Music] He stood before the temple and he said, he said, "Break this temple down and in three days I will rise it up again." HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. [Music] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND so the church today, ABRAHAM FINALLY understood who he was. HALLELUJAH. AND THEN GOD COULD TEST HIM WITH THE WORDS. Then God could test him. Yes. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And can you imagine what kind of test that was? Can you imagine how hell was confused? I trust we are so far. I trust we are all so far. And I speak to each and everyone has been matured. Because I know you are the 11th hour worker. Amen. Yes. And they become they become the same salary. Come on church. THEY HEAR THE SAME VALUES WORDS. AND SOME OF THE OTHERS WERE COMPLAINING. WE WORK FOR AGES AND NOW WE ARE ABLE TO HEAR IT. AND THOSE WORKERS ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME AND THEY HEAR THE SAME MESSAGE. [Applause] WHAT DID THE LORD SAY? IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS. That's my choosing. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So I FEEL IT'S JUST SUCH A PRIVILEGE. Sometimes people tell me at home, you must be careful what to say to the church. But there's a lot of young people. They don't understand that. I said, okay, HOW LONG SHALL WE WAIT? [Music] Because in 10 years we have another young people. We have more YOUNG PEOPLE. Shall we wait? How long shall we wait? Amen. Amen. So if you are now the new people, HOW LONG SHALL we wait? THE RAPTURE IS JUST ABOUT TO HAPPEN. I must be honest with you. You need the truth. [Applause] and you will handle the truth. Yes, I'm not afraid of that. I've seen too many things. AMEN. MAYBE YOU CANNOT handle it here, but be honest. Your heart will lead you. Mary Mary WAS A YOUNG GIRL. WAS A YOUNG GIRL AND AN ANGEL CAME to her. IS THAT RIGHT? BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE. [Music] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. NOT TOUCHED BY A MAN. THAT MEANS SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT RECEIVING, BEING PREGNANT, GIVING BIRTH. A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE, NOT A MOTHER SHALL CONCEIVE. YOU UNDERSTAND? SO WHEN THE ANGEL CAME TO MARY, SHE WAS AS NEW TO THE MESSAGE AS YOU ARE. SHE HAD NEVER HEARD ABOUT IT, NEVER EXPERIENCED IT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. AND THEN THE ANGEL SPOKE TO HER. HE SAID, "BLESSED ARE YOU." CAN I TELL YOU THIS AFTERNOON, BLESSED ARE YOU, YOU ARE BLESSED NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE MONEY. YOU ARE BLESSED NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CAR. YOU ARE BLESSED NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A HOUSE. BUT YOU ARE BLESSED BECAUSE YOU ARE CHOSEN. THAT'S THE MAIN BLESSING TODAY. YOUR HOUSE WILL DISAPPEAR. YOUR CAR WILL DISAPPEAR. YOUR MONEY WILL DISAPPEAR. BUT YOUR CHOOSING CAN NEVER DISAPPEAR BECAUSE HE HAS CHOSEN YOU FROM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. [Applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. And as that angel came to Mary, YOU GET THE PICTURE. CHURCH, YOU GET THE PICTURE. A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE. GOD MAKE IT COMPLICATED. COMPLICATED. HE NEVER SAID A WOMAN SHALL CONCEIVE. HE NEVER SAID A BROTHER SHALL CONCEIVE. NOW A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE. THAT NEVER HAD A MAN. THAT NEVER HAD SEXUAL AFFAIRS, NEVER WAS PREGNANT, SHE SHALL CONCEIVE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU UNDERSTAND TODAY WHY IT IS EASY FOR YOU TO RECEIVE. Oh God, may God help us. Hallelujah. MAY GOD HELP US. AMEN. AMEN. HOW GOD KEPT YOU. VIRGIN. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Oh my. I trust we get the picture. And then Mary had one question because you understand that was so unusual. I'm a young girl. I'm new in this message. Now the angel comes to me. God speaks to me, tells me that I'm chosen. But you understand in the beginning. Mary did not really know what that means. She didn't know what that really means. And God never told her everything from the beginning. The angel just told her what she needed to know. [Music] Don't worry, by and by TIME GOES ON, HE WILL UNVEIL more and more. AND TO YOU THAT ARE THE 11TH HOUR WORKERS, HE WILL REVEAL IT MORE FASTER. WE HAVE NO TIME FOR ANOTHER FOR ANOTHER 25 YEARS. WE HAVE NO MORE NOT ANOTHER 25 YEARS TIME. HALLELUJAH. Rapture might take place before ANY MOMENT THE CHANGE OF THE BODY. ANY MOMENT IN CHRIST SHALL RISE. Can we believe that? So the angel told Mary, he said, "Blessed are you and I can tell you this evening, blessed are you. You are a chosen generation. Amen. A royal priesthood." [Music] She just had a question. He said, "How that happened?" And then he just said what she needed to know. He said, "The Holy Spirit will overshadow you and what you will receive." He never told her of all the difficult times that will come. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He never told her that she later has to go to the upper room to RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. She just he just told her what she needed to know. And this is what God is doing. This is what he did to Abraham. He just told Abraham. He said, "Go and go out of your father. Leave your home. Leave your home and go to a land that I will show thee." Amen. Amen. That was all you understand. AND we will go continue Abraham's journey a little and you stay with me for a little while because I found it profound to to to study Abraham's life and Abraham's journey as as is really identify as our journey. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID NOW ABRAHAM'S JOURNEY HE met God along in different forms. They said he said now that we find that his royal seed travels the same journey that's the bride of Christ travels the same journey that Abraham did. And the last sign Abraham HAD SEEN BEFORE THE PROMISED SON COME WAS WHEN GOD MANIFESTED in human body and two angels came out. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. THAT WAS THE LAST SIGN. AMEN. THE LAST SIGN THAT ABRAHAM HAS SEEN AND THEN THE SON CAME. AND CHURCH, WE ARE LIVING IN THE GENERATION THAT HAVE SEEN THE LAST SIGN. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. THE NEXT GENERATION will bring forth the son. THAT MEANS THE NEXT GENERATION WILL HAVE A CHANGE of the body. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I would trust that we understand that we are the omega generation that will see that experience that IN OUR LIVES IN OUR DAILY LIVES. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THIS NOT A DREAM. THIS IS REALITY. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. But let's let's go slowly. I think we WE NEED TO START with Abraham because with Abraham is special. Why it started with Abraham? Why the generation of Jesus Christ doesn't start with Adam? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. But the generation of Jesus Christ started with Abraham. [Music] [Applause] And as I said many times, Abraham had a name change from Abraham to Abraham. In our generation, we had a a man called Branham. He God in his life, in his father's life, they had a name change from Branham to Branham. Not to make brother Brenham special, but to show that we are living in the hour, that the royal seed of Abraham is here. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Abraham could identify Elohim coming. It was not Sarah. It was Abraham identifying Elohim in Genesis 18. And it was Branheim identifying Elohim in this time. And he said, "This is our Lord. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Now we have to say ABOUT ABRAHAM. Allow me to say a few things about Abraham. Abraham. I think this is very very from the beginning of Abraham's life. It was different than it was with as it was with Adam. Yet Adam had also a covenant. God made a covenant with Adam. Is that right? NOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT GOD HERE MAKES a covenant with Abraham. Can we say amen? We all know that. WHAT IS SO SPECIAL WITH ABRAHAM? WHAT IS MORE SPECIAL THAN IT WAS WITH ADAM? ADAM, HIS COVENANT WAS on condition. Abraham's covenant was without condition. You're with me? Abraham had an unconditional covenant. Now allow me TO FIRST A LITTLE BIT TO SPEAK about the covenant. Why would God MAKE A COVENANT? NOT ABRAHAM with God. God makes a covenant. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Is that not amazing? GOD COMES TO ADAM and makes a covenant with him. And as SOON AS YOU SEE IT WITH ABRAHAM, THE COVENANT His covenant is pregnantated with relationship. [Music] Let that sink. THE COVENANT THAT GOD IS MAKING with men is pregnantated is influenced, consists of relationship. SO WHEN GOD MAKES A COVENANT WITH YOU, WHAT DOES HE HAS IN HIS MIND? [Music] REMEMBER, IT'S NOT man making a covenant WITH GOD. IT IS GOD MAKING A COVENANT with man. GOD MAKING A COVENANT WITH ADAM. [Applause] LOOK WHAT THAT COVENANT WAS. HALLELUJAH. AND EVEN THAT COVENANT, WHAT WAS ADAM? HE WAS MADE IN THE IMAGE OF HIM. AND GOD MADE A COVENANT WITH HIM. WHAT IS IN A COVENANT? A COVENANT IS ACTUALLY A RELATIONSHIP BASED UPON MUTAL COMMITMENTS. That's a covenant. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. We want to go slow because we won't understand the covenant. A covenant. Allow me to read a few things that will help us to understand the covenant a little bit better. A covenant IS ALSO an aliens of friendship. [Music] An alliance of friendship. Uh-huh. Mhm. That's a covenant also with other words. God want to be your friend. He comes down and HE MAKES A COVENANT WITH YOU AND HE TELLS you I am your friend. Do you want to be my friend? Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] Do we have the time to really to dig into it? My wife and me, we are 30 years married now. 35 years. You know what we are? We are really good friends. Good friends understand one another. [Music] Mhm. Good friends understand one another. Does God understand us? I have a question. Do you understand him? How many times in our life we ask why? WHY GOD WHY is this happening to me? How many times? You know why? Because we don't know him that good. Amen. Come on, church. I can do with my wife. Now listen. I I I LEFT MY WIFE NOW ANOTHER 14 days alone at home. And because WE ARE SO CLOSE FRIENDS, SHE UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY why I am leaving her alone at home. VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLES OF THE GOOD shepherd of the good shepherd. [Applause] THE GOOD SHEPHERD leaves the 99 sheep. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE FRIENDS. AND THE GOOD SHEPHERD CAN GO AFTER THAT ONE SHEEP. LEAVE THE OTHER ONES ALONE. AND NOBODY IS FEELING BAD ABOUT IT. [Applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. ABRAHAM, I THINK, WAS CALLED A FRIEND OF GOD. [Applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YES. Oh my. Trust that we understand when God makes A COVENANT, there's something in his mind. GOD MADE a covenant with man. IS THAT RIGHT? NOW, SO A COVENANT is an aliens of friendship, alliance of friendship. [Applause] A covenant IS ALSO A DIVINE CONSTITUTION OR A DIVINE ORDINANCE. AMEN. That's all what a covenant is. A COVENANT IS ALSO A RELATIONSHIP. SO WHEN GOD MAKES A COVENANT, HE WANTS A RELATIONSHIP. AMEN. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. He wants a relationship. Amen. is very amazing as God would now you with me follow me very very very close AS GOD WOULD MAKE THE FIRST COVENANT with mankind. He put that covenant under condition. IS THAT RIGHT? ADAM HAD A COVENANT BUT it worked if you do it was under condition. IT WAS DON'T EAT FROM THAT TREE BECAUSE THE DAY YOU EAT THE DAY YOU DIE. AMEN. SO IT WAS A COVENANT GIVING under condition. WHY WOULD GOD DO A THING LIKE THIS? KNOWING THAT MANKIND COULD NEVER KEEP UP TO THAT CONDITION. YOU KNOW GOD KNOWS THE BEGINNING FROM THE END. [Music] WHY WOULD GOD GIVE THEN A CONDITIONAL COVENANT? KNOWING ADAM COULDN'T KEEP IT. AMEN. You are with me. WHY DID HE NOT GIVE LIKE FOR ABRAHAM AN UNCONDITIONAL COVENANT? HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. Watch now. Not not even that. Actually, God made when we can we can call God make God made three covenants. Let me quickly read that to you. HE SAID GOD MADE THREE COVENANTS. One with Adam. He broke it. He failed. He eats. Is that right? So he broke the covenant. That's why GOD WOULD TELL ADAM, "WHERE ARE YOU?" He was still there, but in a fallen condition. BEFORE THAT HE HAD FALLEN. HE WAS IN A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. GOD WOULD WALK IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING AND ADAM WITH HIM TWO OF THE SAME KIND. [Music] AS SOON AS ADAM BROKE THE COVENANT AND HAD EATEN FROM THE TREE, HE WAS FALLEN. GOD WOULD COME DOWN IN THE COOLER OF THE EVENING AND ADAM WAS HIDING. [Applause] [Music] Now God is calling him. No, listen what Adam said. He said, "I HEARD YOUR VOICE AND I WAS AFRAID. FEAR HINDERS RELATIONSHIP. IF THE WIFE IS AFRAID OF THE HUSBAND, no relationship, IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF GOD, I DON'T mean the fear of God. The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. THERE'S A GREAT DIFFERENCE between the fear of God and being afraid. THE FEAR OF GOD IS RESPECT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I RESPECT GOD. HE IS GOD. BUT I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIM. YES. AMEN. COME ON, CHURCH. WHO IS AFRAID OF GOD THIS THIS AFTERNOON? NO, I I TRUST YOU ARE NOT AFRAID. GOD IS YOUR FRIEND. Now Jesus, Jesus was appearing to the disciples JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THEY HAD fellowship with him, eating with him. AND JUST A FEW MINUTES LATER, HE CAME WALKING ON THE WATER AND HERE THEY SAID, "AH, IT'S A GHOST." THEY WAS AFRAID. WHAT DID JESUS SAY? Fear not. Fear not. [Music] [Applause] Oh my my. If God would be here this EVENING AND HE IS HERE, HE WOULD TELL YOU, "FEAR NOT." [Applause] AMEN. Respect me. Be not afraid. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Be not afraid. There is in love. in love. Paul said to the Corinthians, "Perfect love cast out all. [Music] We have not RECEIVED the spirit of fear. [Applause] [Music] Oh my." Can we say amen so far? Amen. Hallelujah. This is you understand where God wants to take us. My my Adam was fallen. Amen. Adam was not drinking and smoking. ADAM HAD FALLEN out of a relationship. GOD COULD NOT FELLOWSHIP WITH him like before. GOD WANTS TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP with you on the same level. Amen. Yes. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. GOD WANTS HE SPOKE ONCE TO YOPE to Y. HE SPOKE TO Y SAID, JOB, GUARD YOUR LOINS, TALK TO ME LIKE A MAN, WHERE WAS YOU? WHEN THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTED FOR JOY. [Music] Oh church, why did this message came? To take all the fear away. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. And that's why he came to Abraham. We have to continue because just to make that plain NOW GOD MAKE THREE COVENANTS. ONE WITH ADAM, he broke it. ANOTHER ONE WITH NOAH [Music] and he broke it. Come on, go with me to very amazing scripture. Then you will SEE HOW THE COVENANT OF God is impregnated with relationship. SO WHEN GOD MAKES A COVENANT WITH YOU, HE'S LOOKING for relationship. He's looking FOR FRIENDSHIP. HE'S LOOKING FOR MARRIAGE. HE'S LOOKING for union. [Applause] He's looking for someone in the image of God. [Music] This is in the image of the beast. This is in the image of the beast. IS THAT RIGHT? BUT YOU ARE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. [Applause] THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE GREATEST BATTLE OF THE IMAGES, THE IMAGE OF GOD AND THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST. FIGHTING EVERY DAY in your life. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Paul knew that already. Okay, but we continue because I feel that's now let's go to Genesis 9. Genesis 9. Go quickly to Genesis 9. Very, very amazing scripture. The word of God is wonderful. You know, brother Random said the devil hates two books of the Bible the most. Genesis and Revelation. Because Genesis is a C chapter. Seed chapter gays beginning there. You see everything in the beginning in seed form in Revelation. You see the manifestation. Amen. Amen. Let's Genesis 9:13. We want to first see um the rainbow. Because he gave finally the rainbow as a sign. Is that right? Come on. 9:13. Chapter 9 verse 13. I DO SET MY BOW IN THE CLOUDS AND IT SHALL BE FOR A TOKEN OF A COVENANT between me and the earth. [Music] Amen. Amen. SO THE RAINBOW IS A TOKEN OF A COVENANT THAT GOD MADE WITH NOAH ON THE EARTH. Is that right? As soon AS YOU SEE THE RAINBOW, IT IS A TOKEN OF A COVENANT THAT GOD IS MAKING with Noah or with the earth. BUT AGAIN, YOU SEE THAT COVENANT IS UNDER CONDITIONS. Let's go quickly to Genesis 9:1. you see something beautiful. And when we read that, I want to stretch your spiritual jacket as we read that. I asked you, did you hear that before? AND NOAH AND HIS SONS and God blessed NOAH AND HIS SONS. AND SAID UNTO THEM, "Be fruitful, AND MULTIPLY, AND REPLENISH THE EARTH." Have you have heard that before? YES. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TO ADAM. [Applause] COME ON, CHURCH. AS HE MADE A COVENANT WITH ADAM. [Applause] HALLELUJAH. HE SAID TO ADAM, "BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY AND REPLENISH THE EARTH." NOW HE MAKES A COVENANT WITH NOAH. AND HE SAID THE SAME THING, "BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY AND REPLENISH. What is he telling to Abraham? What is he telling to Abraham? He said, "Thy seed with other words, BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY. THY SEED, THY SEED SHALL BE THE SAND AND DUST OF THIS OF THE SEA. THY SEED SHALL HAVE INFLUENCE IN ALL THE GENERATIONS with other words. He said to Adam, to Abraham, BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY AND REPLENISH THE EARTH. THY SEED SHALL BE AND THAT SEED WAS JESUS CHRIST. THAT SEED WAS JESUS CHRIST IN BRIDE FORM. [Music] is impregnated with relationship. Now to be fruitful and to multiply it has to be a union has TO BE A RELATIONSHIP. Is it right? No. Noah could NOT HAVE CHILDREN ON HIS OWN. He had to have children with his wife. COME ON CHURCH. AND BEFORE SEXUALITY WAS INTRODUCED, WHEN THE FIRST COVENANT WAS MADE, WHEN GOD SAID TO ADAM, "BE FRUITFUL AND REPLENISH." HE NEVER SPOKE OF SEXUAL MULTIPLICATION. HALLELUJAH. HE SPOKE OF SPIRITUAL MULTIPLICATION. [Applause] OH, if you had time, we could go into that. How brother Adam said then sin came in and God allowed sexuality as a multiplication when it is put into a marriage. Everybody can say amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But from the beginning it was not so. Yes. No. From the beginning it was not sexual multiplication. GOD HAS IN HIS MIND A relationship where spiritual multiplication is normal. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can your heart say amen? I know sometimes your brain especially at this time of the day. Yeah. Our brain sometimes fails especially especially after you have eaten all the blood GOES IN THE STOMACH AND THEN YOUR BRAIN fails to get. [Music] That's why I WOULD NOT SAY DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT BUT I WOULD ASK YOU DO YOU BELIEVE IT? LET YOUR HEART SPEAK. CAN YOUR HEART SAY AMEN? I REJOICE. [Music] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. So why would God make a covenant? Now let's see again what a covenant is else. But he said a covenant. Brother Brandham said in the message Christ the mystery of God reveals. He said you know a covenant what God is doing. Christ, the mystery of God, he reveals page 24. He said, "Now listen, when when God put men on partnership with him, when God MAKES WHEN GOD MAKES A COVENANT WITH MEN UPON THE BASIS OF SPIRITUAL MULTIPLICATION, NOT SEXUAL, BUT SPIRITUAL AMEN. HE'S ACTUALLY ASKING YOU, DO YOU WANT TO BE MY PARTNER? [Music] [Applause] [Music] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. WHO WANTS TO BE A PARTNER OF GOD THIS EVENING? HEY, GOD IS ASKING YOU, [Music] BE MY PARTNER. GOD IS ASKING MEN, "DO YOU WANT TO BE my partner? YOU CAN SAY AS A MAN, BUT I'M BORN IN SIN. I'M SHAKEN IN INIQUITY. HOW CAN I BE YOUR PARTNER? WHAT WILL GOD TELL YOU? THAT'S WHY I DIED AT CALVARY. THAT'S WHY I DIED AT CALVARY. GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD. GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON. WHAT DID HE DO? RECONCILING THE WORLD WITH HIMSELF [Applause] to reconcile is not only to forgive. Forgive is the first step. But to reconcile is bringing him back in the same relationship. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, I trust you see the picture. I TRUST YOU SEE THE PICTURE. WHY WE HAD THAT GLORIOUS DAY ON CALVARY. Why we had that glorious DAY ON CALVARY. WHY? IT WAS A bloody lamb taking the book. THE BOOK. ADAM LOST THE BOOK. ADAM LOST THE RELATIONSHIP. YES. ADAM LOST THE RELATIONSHIP. [Music] The Bible says God created at the seventh day. God rested. Where did God rest? What is his holiday place? When the Bible SAID GOD RESTED. YEAH. Can you bring that up? It's nice. Yeah. Yeah. And partnership a beautiful quote, right? But the Bible says and God rested on the seventh day. Is that right? God rested. You know where he rested? He rested in Adam who was giving all the names to all the animals was not God. No, he rested. Adam did it. Even when the serpent came here, the serpent came to Adam. Adam looked at the serpent said, "Oh." And the serpent could say, "I'm longer here than you church. There were seven stars in the hand of God. It was the last star that could give name to all the other stars. IT WAS NOT THE FIRST STAR. IT WAS NOT PAUL GIVING ALL NAMES TO ALL THE OTHER STARS. IT WAS THE LAST STAR IN THE HAND OF GOD WHO GAVE NAME TO ALL THE OTHER STARS. PAUL COULD SAY, "WE SEE THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY." BUT THEN WHEN THE LAST STAR IS HERE, WE SEE FROM FACE TO FACE. IT'S A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP, CHURCH. [Applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY ADAM, HE CAME AT AT LAST. FIRST GOD HAD THE CREATION THE ANIMALS. IS THAT RIGHT? FINALLY ADAM CAME. NOW WHEN GOD RESTED THEN ADAM GIVE ALL NAMES TO ALL THE ANIMALS AND GOD WAS NOT WORRIED THAT ADAM COULD GIVE NAME GIVE THEM WRONG NAMES BECAUSE ADAM GOD WAS RESTING IN ADAM. WAS A RELATIONSHIP [Applause] BECAUSE MAN WAS IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. [Applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. JUMP AND SHOUT. I UNDERSTAND WHY HE DIED AT CALVARY. WE SIT HERE TODAY IN OUR SINFUL BODIES NOT redeemed yet. AND YET GOD CAN COME DOWN AND HAVE FELLOWSHIP with us. THAT'S WHY I WOULD COUNSEL YOU. STAY under the blood. [Applause] I WOULD COUNSEL YOU. STAY EVERY MOMENT, EVERY DAY, EVERY HOUR, EVERY SECOND. STAY UNDER THE BLOOD. BECAUSE WHEN YOU STAY UNDER THE BLOOD, GOD IS ONLY HEARING YOUR VOICE AND HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. What a wonderful story. You understand? again. You understand? God make a covenant with Noah. Yes. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. No wonder we are about you know this is entering the millennium. The millennium is a seven as the seventh day. You understand the types of the shadows. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. We are entering another phase. We are entering another phase. We will have the millennium. Amen. Is that right? Come on. He has six days of creation. And now we have six days or 6,000 years of redemption. Actually on the seventh day God was resting. Where was he resting in Adam? Hallelujah. He was resting in Adam and Eve. Adam and the woman. He was resting in them. Can he rest today? Are we his place of rest? You know what Jesus said 2,000 years ago? He said, "The foxes have holes, the birds have nests, but the son of man has no place to lay his head. [Music] [Applause] The son of man came back in these days. When you see the cloud, you see only the head. Is that right? There's only the head. Is that the son of man? Jesus Christ. But you only see the head. Now that cloud, the prophet was taken up in that cloud in that constellation of seven angels which formed the cloud. Is that right? THE CLOUD IS NOT FORMED BY A ROCKET. The cloud is formed by seven angels. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And we only COULD SEE THE HEADS. YOU KNOW WHY ONLY THE HEADS? IF YOU GO AND SHE LOOKED AT YOUR PASSPORT AND THE PASSPORT, YOU ONLY HAVE THE HEADS. YOU DON'T have the whole body. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. WHY ONLY THE HEADS? 2,000 YEARS AGO, JESUS SAID, "FOXES HAVE FAULTS." BUT the son OF MAN HAS NO BODY TO LAY HIS HEAD ON. BUT IN THIS HOUR, HE FOUND A BODY REDEEMED BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB. YES. Thank God for Calvary. Stay under the blood, church. Stay quickly. If something has happened, stay under the blood. Put yourself under the blood. When you see the blood, he sees not you. He sees through the blood. What does he see? HE ONLY HEARS YOUR VOICE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND HE WOULD TALK TO US TODAY. Talk to me. LIKE I WANT YOU TO TALK TO ME. TALK TO ME LIKE ONLY MY BRIDE CAN TALK TO ME. WE CAN SEE TYPES IN THE BIBLE. WE SEE RUTH IN THE BIBLE. WE SEE ESTHER in the Bible. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But we don't go there today. Amen. Can you say praise the Lord? Hallelujah. But he was he was Abraham. Now in he has a covenant. You're still with a covenant because you want to stay true to that. Now God make three covenants. The first two covenants with Adam and with Noah he made under condition. Why God doing that? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So that man understands what I do. You have nothing to do with that. So that you understand his covenant with you is his grace. You cannot earn it. You cannot work for it. You cannot go to church for it. You cannot change your doctrine for it. You cannot be baptized in the right name for it. When God makes a covenant for you, when God comes in relationship with you, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, you have nothing to do WITH THAT. IT'S GOD'S CHOICE. IT'S GOD'S CHOICE. HIS GRACE TOWARDS YOU. THAT IS THAT'S WHY THE ANGEL SAID TO MARY, "BLESSED ARE YOU." And I CAN TELL YOU THIS EVENING, "BLESSED ARE YOU, NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE SO GOOD, NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE SO NICE, BUT God loved you. [Applause] One day Israel, you know the people of Israel would ask God and many times we we ask God, God, do you love us? Israel, they ask themselves the question, God, do you love us? You know what God told them? You know what God gave them as an answer? Jacob have I loved. Esau have I hated. [Music] God's love for you is that he chose you. Hallelujah. Listen. He chose you not to be a monkey on the tree. But he chose you to be a part of the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I trust we get the picture. GOD HAD TO ALLOW MORE THAN 2,000 years of really a covenant under condition to let go mankind to corrupt themsself. Finally, he would speak to Abraham. Said, Abraham, now with you I make a covenant. Now I can put him under no condition. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. You understand that? Because the covenant is so amazing that we need to understand We have nothing to do with that. Somebody can say amen. [Applause] [Music] With this covenant that God is making with mankind, mankind has to know I have nothing to do with that. As long as you feel you have something to do with it, God cannot use you. Somebody can say amen to that. Amen. Amen. But when you feel is just by grace, then God can do everything and he can use you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're with me. On our way to all things. [Music] Now we understand the things that we see IN THE LIFE OF OF Abraham is not conditions. It is foundations. Oh, wonderful. Yes, IT'S FOUNDATIONAL. IT'S NEVER CONDITIONED. IF ABRAHAM OBEY GOD OR NOT, NEVER CHANGED THE COVENANT. THE COVENANT WAS UNDER NO CONDITION. Somebody can say amen. BECAUSE SUCH A GOD HAS SUCH A GREAT WORK. HE DON'T WANT MAN TO BRAG ABOUT HIMSELF. He don't want men he to brag about himself. THE WORK OF GOD IS SO GREAT. HE WANT TO MAKE SURE that man has nothing to do with it. Yes, I trust I can make it that simple. Amen. Amen. As soon as we are lifting ourselves above zero, we are lifting ourselves above God. But a zero has a big value [Music] when it is behind the one. behind the one. If you take the one right and put a zero behind it, it is 10. Hallelujah. Somebody can say amen. That's why brother Brandham said If we humble ourselves, if we learn to humble ourselves, never lift yourself above zero, stay zero, stay behind the great one. AND THEN BECAUSE OF YOU, OF THE ZERO, THE FIRST, HALLELUJAH, BECOMES THE LAST HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. UM, we have a few minutes time. Yes. Because we want to see. Let's go to Matthew 7:24. Matthew 7:24. As we are speaking of conditions and no conditions because we will find a lot of things in the life of Hey, come on church. WE FIND circumcision in the life of Abraham. Is that right? A type of the Holy Ghost baptism. [Applause] CIRCUMCISION WAS NOT a condition. [Music] Here we go. Oh, I trust that sinks in. But circumcision was foundational. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The baptism OF THE HOLY GHOST is not a condition. It is a foundation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my. Oh my. We should be the happiest PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. WE HAVE A COVENANT WITHOUT ANY CONDITION AND WE STAND ABOUT A SURE FOUNDATION. Let's go a little bit. It's wonderful to see Matthew 7:24. Matthew 7:24. uh think it is like that. Therefore, whosoever heareth these things of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man who spilled his house upon a rock. The rain cometh, DESCENDANTS, AND THE FLOOD CAME, and the winds blew and beat upon the house, and it fell, not was founded upon a rock. [Music] Hallelujah. this wonderful relationship upon a rock. HALLELUJAH. UPON A ROCK. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS NOT UNDER CONDITION. THAT'S WHY WE DON'T NEED TO BE AFRAID OF GOD. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. You're with me. Hallelujah. We will we will go there. Now foundation rock. This what we read in the Bible here that the rock a rock exists of more than 30 different elements. If you have time, if we had time, we could go into the elements. But that rock, that foundation exists from different elements. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if you take the elements out, the foundation becomes weak. IF YOU TAKE ELEMENTS out of the rocks. It becomes sand and no one builds his house upon sand. God is not building his church upon sand. GOD IS BUILDING HIS CHURCH UPON THE ROCK OF REVELATION. [Applause] You're with me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Again, you understand what Abraham did as he started his journey. Let's go quickly. Let's take 10 minutes, okay? And then I trust we can come to an end. But just to show you as Abraham started his journey what God is doing and how God is bringing him to all things. Now remember, he had an unconditional covenant. So everything what he was doing was foundational. Let's quickly go through it. Genesis 12:5. Let's get quickly go quickly go Genesis 12:5. Maybe the brother can bring it and we can read it together. Genesis 12:5. Somebody can say, "Praise the Lord." You're still happy. You still love the Lord. Amen. Amen. Are we ON THE SAME ROAD THAT ABRAHAM IS WALKING? AMEN. AMEN. Verse 5. Chapter 12:5. Abraham took Sarah, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son, AND ALL THE substance that they had gathered, the souls that they had gotten in a haram, and went forth and go into the land of Canaan. SO GOD CALLED HIM ALONE BUT HE took Lot with him. Now watch Lot. THAT MEANS ALSO that Abraham TOOK A LOT OF THINGS with him THAT WAS NOT GOOD FOUND FOR THE FOUNDATION. SO GOD COULD NOT BUILD THAT HOUSE as long as love was there. Abraham never lost his covenant because the covenant was unconditional. Are you not glad the covenant is unconditional? Has nothing to do with you. Not when you do, I do. No, I have already done it. But you watch 12:5 it was Lot. He was taking Lot with him. A lot of sandy things LIKE WE TAKE IN OUR LIFE. A LOT OF THINGS LOT OF THINGS THAT doesn't help us on our journey. You're with me? Amen. Amen. But you understand he never lost his covenant. 12:10. Now Abraham was said to go into the land. In chapter 12 10 there was a famine in the land. And Abram there was a famine in the land AND ABRAM WENT DOWN INTO EGYPT. THE SOLDIER THERE FOR THE FAMINE was grievable. HE NEVER LOST HIS COVENANT. HE NEVER LOST HIS COVENANT. AMEN. BUT YOU UNDERSTAND HE DID SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT FOUNDATIONAL GOODS. Somebody can say praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. As brother Brandham would say, we don't have the time or maybe we read it quickly that you can see what brother Brandham is saying. He said finally in the he said then GOD WANTS TO SEPARATE YOURSELF AND GET SO FAR AWAY FROM THE THINGS till you don't even see them at all. [Music] AMEN. GOD WANT YOU TO SEPARATE FROM THINGS. BUT THAT IS NOT CONDITIONAL. That is foundational. See the difference? See the difference? [Music] Hallelujah. We don't we don't have the time. We go quickly through it. IN GENESIS 13:14, after Lot separated. Now watch very carefully. I trust you still with me. Look how Abraham separated from Lot. What a gentleman he was. The Bible says, come on. The Bible tells us, look, AND THE LORD SAID UNTO ABRAHAM, the Lot was separated from Oh, look. Abraham, you know how he separated from Lot? You know what he did to Lord? He said, "Lord, come. We have too many troubles with the hurts. You choose." Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brothers, that's the way God wants you to separate from the world. Hallelujah. COME ON, CHURCH. THAT'S THE WAY GOD WANTS YOU TO SEPARATE from unbelievers. What do YOU DO WITH UNBELIEVERS IN YOUR HOUSE? You kick them out. [Applause] Uhhuh. Abraham never kick Lot out. Look the LOOK THE THE CHARACTER OF ABRAHAM. HALLELUJAH. Look the quality of Abraham. Hallelujah. Somebody can say praise the Lord. CHURCH THE BRIDE HAS A DIFFERENT QUALITY BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS. SHE DON'T HAS TO FIGHT. SHE CAN LOVE HER ENEMIES BECAUSE SHE DON'T HAS TO FIGHT FOR HER RIGHTS. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Genesis 13:14. You can see Lot separated from Abraham. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Then Genesis 13, WE FIND OUT HE MOVED OUT OF EGYPT BACK TO THE PROMISED LAND. AND THE BIBLE SAYS HE DWELT IN THE PROMISED LAND. THAT WAS NOT CONDITIONAL FOUNDATIONAL. GOD CAN ONLY BLESS YOU AS LONG AS YOU ARE IN the promises. [Applause] [Music] Stay with me for a few minutes because the picture must become clear. Everything we do has nothing to do with the covenant. I DRINK AS MUCH AS I WANT. I SMOKE as much as I want. I COMMIT ADULTERY AS MUCH AS I WANT. But I don't want [Music] I'M NOT AFRAID THAT I LOSE MY COVENANT BECAUSE I CANNOT LOSE MY COVENANT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. [Music] QUICKLY. Genesis 14, Lot because of trouble, he becomes A SLAVE. AND WHAT IS ABRAHAM DOING? HE'S GOING AFTER HIM. IS THAT RIGHT? ABRAHAM IS FIGHTING FOR LOT. [Music] Somebody can say amen. But he never went to Sodom. He never went to Sodom. He stayed in Canaan. Somebody can say, "Praise the Lord." GENESIS 14, HE RECEIVED COMMUNION. AMEN. [Music] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Genesis 14, he received communion. As we talk about that, he was Mazdc coming with bread and wine after the battle of the kings. Now understand the church. YOU PERSONALLY walk the same way that Abraham went. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now we come to another one. Genesis 14:20. I think it's 14:20. Abraham paid tithe, paying tithe is not conditional, but paying tithe is foundational. [Music] Look, and he blessed be the most high God which has delivered thine enemies into thine hand. And he gave him tithe of all. Paying tithe is not a condition. Paying tithe belongs to the foundation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody can say praise the Lord. I I TELL YOU WHEN I SAW THAT I WAS JUMPING AT HOME. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Then Genesis 15:1, we quickly go through with it. After all those things, after these things, the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision. [Music] I wished I wish that goes into us. After all the foundational things, the word of the Lord came unto Abraham, saying, "Fear not, Abraham. I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward. It was church. It was after these things, after these foundational things that God spoke to him. All the things we do, we do not because it's a condition. Become that clear. WE DO THINGS NOT because they are conditional. [Music] They belong to a foundation. If you PAY TITHING AS a condition, there's no blessing connected to it. Amen. I had a brother coming to me not long ago from from my own church. He said to me, "Brother, I really don't understand. I pay my tithe and it looks like I have never enough money." I said to him, "Brother, there's nothing wrong. Just learn to pay your tithing not as a condition. Learn you pay your tithing as a foundation. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. THEN I DON'T CARE ABOUT MY bank account. then I don't care if my bank account is full or not because I pay it as a foundation. I DON'T PAY IT SO THAT GOD BLESS ME NOW. NO. HALLELUJAH. Somebody can say amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yeah. Is that okay when I talk like this? I know I'm not the pastor here. I cannot hide. I am a pastor. I cannot hide. You know, this is what I want the church to really to understand. OUR NORMAL LIFE. OUR NORMAL life in in my own life. Our normal life. Amen. Amen. Let me go on. Genesis. Uh let me read quickly what brother Brandham said in Masterpiece. Here's where I'm coming from. You bring back the the the Genesis 15 verse one. And God spoke to him in a vision. [Music] Genesis 12. God just spoke to him. But now he speaks to him through a vision. This is like prophetic. Hallelujah. AFTER ALL, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AFTER ALL THE THINGS. COME ON CHURCH. AFTER ALL THE THINGS BECOMING FOUNDATIONAL. NOW God speaks to you. Come on. God speaks to you. NOT BECAUSE OF A CONDITION BUT BECAUSE OF THESE THINGS BECOMING FOUNDATIONAL. NOW GOD can speak TO YOU TODAY THROUGH A VISION THROUGH A PROPHET THROUGH A PROPHETIC MESSAGE. GOD CAN SPEAK TO YOU PERSONALLY. COME ON CHURCH. WHEN I READ THIS MESSAGE, GOD IS SPEAKING TO ME. [Applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. We don't have time. masterpiece. NOW THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE Godman got an offer and changed FROM SUPERNATURAL TO THE VISION. The supernatural God has changed himself to a vision. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And the VISION is then projected to the image. And the vision was projected into the image. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can we understand that when God speak to us prophetic, he speaks to us through a vision and then that vision is PROJECTED into the image AND THE IMAGE IS you [Music] become the word. [Music] [Applause] Or can I say you become God? Can I say that? Is that right? BECAUSE THE SUPERNATURAL IS GOD. HE CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A VISION, prophetic message. NOW THE VISION, THE PROPHETIC MESSAGE. HE PROJECTED THE IMAGE. WHAT DO WE HAVE THEN? MAN IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Quickly we go. We don't we don't read everything. Genesis 17. Circumcision. CIRCUMCISION is not a condition. [Music] Yes. Yes. Circumcision is not a condition. Circumcision is a foundation. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is not a condition. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is a foundation. You must be born again. you're there then Genesis 18 remember Abraham on his way to all things we are on our journey to all things right who is still on his journey who still on his journey we are on our journey Not back into the mind, back to be manifested sons and daughters of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Genesis 18 after so many years. You see Elohim coming to Abraham. Abraham an old man. What an attitude. What an attitude. Attitude is not a condition. The right attitude belongs to the foundation. [Music] In one message, brother Brennan said, he said, uh, quickening power is here this morning. Do you believe quickening power is here this evening? any sense. It depends what attitude you have if it does you good or not. So the attitude, the right attitude is not a condition. But the right attitude belongs to the foundation. Can we say praise the Lord? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And then Genesis 18, what an attitude. He fell down. He worshiped. He invited him home. He make something to eat for him. No critic. No complaint. HALLELUJAH. NO COMPLAIN OF ABRAHAM. No critic. No complaints. No murmur. Where are we this evening? I trust we come into this meeting not complaining, not murmuring. I trust we came into the meeting with a heart full of thanksgiving. Who came in this meeting with a heart full of thanksgiving, [Music] WHO CAME THIS EVENING WITH A HEART FULL OF THANKS AND FULL OF GLORY. YES, WE WAIT FOR 2,000 YEARS. YES, ABRAHAM WAITED FOR SO LONG AND NOW HE CAME AGAIN. THE SAME ONE THAT MADE THE PROMISE WAS PRESENT. THE SAME ONE THAT MADE THE PROMISE IS PRESENT THIS EVENING. THE SAME ONE IS PRESENT TONIGHT. WHAT KIND OF ATTITUDE DO WE HAVE THIS EVENING SITTING IN A MEETING like this? [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. And then Abraham and Sarah brought forth then Abraham and Sarah brought forth the son. Can we believe that? Now the bride, Christ and the bride will bring forth. What son? What son you will bring forth? The son of man. Do we have sodom condition? Do we have sodom condition worse than it was in the days of brother Brandham? Hello. Hello. This is WORSE than it was when brother Brandham was here. We living in the days of Sodom. Is that right? Come on, church. What was in the days of Sodom? Remember the Lord was sitting in the gate. Two angels came. AMEN. AND THE WHOLE CITY, YOUNG AND OLD, CAME OUT BECAUSE NEW FLESH had arrived. And they KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF LOT. AND SAID, "GIVE US THESE MEN OUT." LORD TOOK HIS DAUGHTERS OUT AND TOLD HIM, "HERE YOU HAVE MY DAUGHTERS." WHAT DID THEY SAY? WE DON'T WANT DAUGHTERS. We want men. Come on, church. Where are we today? YOU AND UGANDA, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT BACK. YOUR GOVERNMENT IS still very conservative. GERMAN GOVERNMENT, EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT, ALL OTHER GOVERNMENTS, IT'S ROTTEN. IT'S SODOM. OUR CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN, [Applause] OUR CHILDREN, IN SCHOOL, they get taught different than what they are taught at home. I don't have time to go into details, but there's laws that we as parents cannot raise our children the way we want it. As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be when the son of man has been revealed. And at the end, Abraham and Sarah brought forth the son. What son? The son of man. I have five quotes. I don't want to read them. This is what brother Brandham said. He said, "Son of man ministry, son of man ministry." He said, "It is me and you together. We together. We together we will do it." That means your life is manifesting the son of man. Hallelujah. That is God's great covenant. Multiply and replenish. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A unconditional covenant. Build it upon a strong foundation. It's a picture become very clear all the things that we do. It's not conditions. It is foundation. God bless you. Let us stand together. I know it's becoming late.
