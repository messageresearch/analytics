[45:29] we want to talk about we are
[45:33] stewards over every one of us we are
[45:37] stewards praise the name of the Lord so
[45:40] let us stand up and go to our scripture
[45:45] reading Luke
[45:48] 12 and then verse
[45:54] 42 Luke 12 vers 4
[46:03] 48 so the Bible
[46:05] says and the Lord said who then is that
[46:10] faithful and wise Steward whom his Lord
[46:13] shall make ruler over his household to
[46:16] give them their portion of meat in due
[46:19] season
[46:42] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[46:45] when he cometh shall find so doing
[46:57] the truth I say unto you that he will
[46:59] make him ruler over all that he
[47:09] has but and if this that servant said in
[47:13] his heart my Lord delayeth his coming
[47:18] and shall begin to beat the men servants
[47:20] and the
[47:22] maidens and to eat and drink and to be
[47:25] drunken
[47:39] the Lord of that servant will come in a
[47:42] day when he lookth not for him and at an
[47:45] hour when he is not aware will at him in
[47:48] a and will appoint him his portion with
[47:51] the unbelievers
[48:06] and that servant which knew his Lord's
[48:09] will and prepared not himself neither
[48:13] did according to his will shall be
[48:16] beaten with many stripes
[48:29] but he that knew not and did commit
[48:31] things worth of Stripes shall be beaten
[48:34] with few stripes for un soever much is
[48:37] given of wh shall be much required andto
[48:40] whom men have committed much of they
[48:43] will ask the more
[49:14] amen so we are sharing on that we are
[49:21] stewards every one of us is a
[49:25] steward praise the name of the Lord as a
[49:29] child at home you a
[49:32] steward as a parent at home you a
[49:36] Ste as a husband you a
[49:39] Ste as a wife you are a
[49:43] Ste and you know our
[49:46] stewardship keeps on
[49:50] varing you know based on the
[49:52] responsibility that you have
[49:56] like as a
[49:59] husband I have the stewardship of being
[50:02] a husband to my
[50:05] wife but that's not the end of it I have
[50:09] also a
[50:11] steward of being a father to my
[50:15] children and that's not the end of it I
[50:18] also have a
[50:19] stewardship of being a son to my
[50:24] parents praise the name of our Lord
[50:27] and then we also have
[50:29] stewardship beyond our
[50:32] families in the communities that we
[50:35] live in the work that we do in the
[50:39] activities that we are
[50:41] involved we are all
[50:45] stewards even if you are still staying
[50:47] with your
[50:48] parents you have a
[50:51] stewardship praise the name of the Lord
[50:54] and then now in the message God does not
[50:57] call man to
[51:01] judgment brother Bram says now because
[51:06] we have a
[51:09] responsibility that we've got to answer
[51:11] to
[51:12] [Music]
[51:16] God every man that come on the face of
[51:19] the
[51:20] Earth has to answer to
[51:24] God for a respons
[51:28] and to many of us a
[51:32] stewardship we have to answer
[51:36] for this
[51:38] responsibility is
[51:41] stewardship so any responsibility that
[51:44] you
[51:45] have makes you a
[51:48] steward in that
[51:50] matter praise the name of our Lord then
[51:53] he says the stewardship that has been
[51:55] committed to Us by
[51:58] God I don't care what it
[52:02] is as I said a few moments
[52:05] ago
[52:07] AWI then be aing
[52:12] housewi that's right if it is to be a
[52:16] farmer be a genuine
[52:18] farmer whatever it is that God has put
[52:23] you to
[52:25] do you got a
[52:28] stewardship to that you've got to answer
[52:31] to God
[52:33] for because it takes all these things to
[52:36] do
[52:37] it each of us is a
[52:41] steward every responsibility you have in
[52:45] life makes you to be a
[52:48] steward praise the name of the Lord at
[52:51] our homes we are
[52:52] Steward when we come to church here we
[52:55] are also steward
[52:57] praise the name of our Lord we have a
[53:00] responsibility something that the Lord
[53:03] expects from
[53:04] us that we need to
[53:07] do so each of us has got a
[53:11] responsibility each of us has got a
[53:14] role what God has committed you to
[53:18] do praise the name of it's our
[53:21] responsibility it's our
[53:23] stewardship now we go back to Luke 12
[53:26] vers
[53:28] 42 it says and the Lord
[53:32] said who then is that
[53:38] faithful and
[53:41] [Music]
[53:42] wise so in being a steward you need to
[53:46] be
[53:47] faithful and you need to be
[53:50] wise praise the name of the Lord now to
[53:53] be a
[53:54] steward you are a
[54:06] manager you are
[54:09] entrusted with one
[54:15] Estate One
[54:17] property and
[54:20] buses or
[54:24] services that is still
[54:28] each of us we are
[54:31] stewards you are a
[54:34] manager you are an
[54:37] overseer you are
[54:39] entrusted with somebody's
[54:42] property you are
[54:44] interested with somebody's
[54:48] businesses you
[54:49] areed with somebody's
[54:53] Services we are all stewards
[54:57] and as
[54:59] stewards we need to be
[55:02] faithful in our
[55:04] stewardship and we also need to be
[55:07] wise in our
[55:09] stewardship praise the name of our now
[55:12] the Bible tells us in Psalms
[55:17] 134 praise the name of the Lord Psalms
[55:23] 134 and then verse three
[55:29] the Lord has made Heaven and
[55:32] Earth bless the out of
[55:40] Zion so he says the Lord has made
[55:46] heaven and he has made
[55:49] us so you look at the heavens and then
[55:53] you look at the Earth the Bible says
[55:56] the Lord has made
[55:58] them in Psalms 115 verse
[56:05] 15 yes it
[56:08] says Psalms 115 and verse
[56:14] 15 you are blessed of the Lord which
[56:18] made Heaven and Earth
[56:28] so it says the
[56:29] Lord has made the Heaven and
[56:32] Earth and then he has blessed
[56:36] us the
[56:38] heaven even the
[56:41] heavens the
[56:44] Lord but the Earth he has given to the
[56:47] children of
[56:50] men so it says God made the heavens and
[56:53] the
[56:54] Earth then says the heavens of the
[56:58] heavens they are thees and then when he
[57:01] made the US he gave to
[57:06] us so whatever we
[57:10] have doesn't belong to us we are
[57:14] stewards praise the name of the Lord
[57:17] then in Psalms 24
[57:20] ver1 he
[57:23] says the Earth is the lordes
[57:27] and the fullness thereof the world and
[57:31] they that dwell
[57:41] therein the ownership
[57:45] now and the fullness
[57:48] there even them thatwell on the
[57:52] Earth are
[57:55] the so you are not your
[57:58] own you are not your own you are the
[58:02] L so what are you you
[58:06] a you are a steward of your
[58:10] body praise the name over Lord you are a
[58:13] steward of your
[58:15] spirit you are a steward of your
[58:18] soul that's why there's
[58:21] judgment praise the name of our because
[58:24] God has created you
[58:26] and is the one who has given you the
[58:28] body that
[58:29] you praise the name of is the one who
[58:32] has given you the body you
[58:34] have but you know there are people are
[58:36] not comfortable with their
[58:39] bodies says the nose is too big I go for
[58:42] plastic they reduce
[58:47] it then it sees the shape of the
[58:51] head you know different ships we have
[58:56] some are like
[58:58] triangle then others are flat up
[59:01] here then others are straight
[59:04] here others are like a
[59:07] box others are like a
[59:10] ball you a steward of
[59:14] that praise the name of our Lord you are
[59:17] a
[59:19] Ste your
[59:21] soul you are a
[59:23] steward the Bible says all the fullness
[59:28] there and even them that dwell
[59:32] there so as a human being you are a
[59:37] steward of your
[59:39] body before God and there is a way God
[59:42] demands
[59:44] you to handle your
[59:47] body praise the name of you a
[59:51] steward God has made
[59:53] you and he gave you this body

[1:00:22] body God has given
[1:00:24] you and
[1:00:30] what God demands faithful
[1:00:34] stewards praise the name of Lord and
[1:00:37] then some others they are not
[1:00:39] comfortable with the color God has given
[1:00:44] them then they
[1:00:46] start and then you get there others
[1:00:49] where the formul doesn't
[1:00:52] work their pches here is yellow
[1:00:59] then others you get is
[1:01:02] brown but you look at the ears they

[1:01:12] or then you look at the an
[1:01:18] down but up is white is
[1:01:21] brown we are

[1:01:26] demands us to handle what he has given
[1:01:30] us the body God has given you you
[1:01:34] Steward that's why the Bible say you are

[1:01:45] are

[1:15:11] 29 reading from verse
[1:15:19] 10 so it
[1:15:21] says wherefore David blessed the Lord
[1:15:26] before all the congregation and David
[1:15:29] said blessed be thou Lord God of Israel
[1:15:33] Our Father forever and
[1:15:48] ever praise the name of our Lord David
[1:15:51] blessed the
[1:15:53] Lord Lord you are blessed forever
[1:15:57] and why was he
[1:15:59] blessing now in verse
[1:16:02] 11 it says thine oh Lord is the
[1:16:07] greatness and the power and the glory
[1:16:10] and the Victory and the Majesty for all
[1:16:15] that is in heaven and in the earth is
[1:16:19] thine thine is the kingdom oh Lord and
[1:16:22] th art exalted as head above above
[1:16:44] all see how he's acknowledging
[1:16:47] God lord if any
[1:16:51] greatness It's You

[1:17:13] yours even the
[1:17:16] kingdom is yours you are exalted above
[1:17:20] all
[1:17:22] things and now we need to learn that
[1:17:24] enough our
[1:17:26] Liv that even my own
[1:17:29] life is not mine the life I have the
[1:17:34] Lord is praise the name of the Lord has
[1:17:38] given me this
[1:17:39] life any time when the Lord so
[1:17:43] pleases he takes it away because it is
[1:17:46] in his
[1:17:48] hand we are
[1:17:50] stewards we are PS and
[1:17:53] strangers we just have season where we
[1:17:55] are here on
[1:17:57] Earth so even the things that we
[1:18:00] have they are not ours they all belong
[1:18:04] to you know in Kenya when the white
[1:18:07] settlers were
[1:18:09] there they
[1:18:14] made for
[1:18:16] 999
[1:18:20] years nobody can last that long
[1:18:24] the man is is just putting
[1:18:27] there maybe somebody
[1:18:32] F because they were giving
[1:18:34] themselves and they say
[1:18:37] 999
[1:18:41] years but you have no
[1:18:45] guarantee that in the 999
[1:18:50] years policies will change
[1:18:55] the government will come and change
[1:18:56] whatever you think is
[1:19:00] yours like in some countries they were
[1:19:02] nationalizing
[1:19:09] compies you're not sure you just here
[1:19:13] for a period of time a short
[1:19:16] time but David is saying all that we
[1:19:21] have yours Lord and that's one thing
[1:19:24] need to
[1:19:26] recognize that when I've committed
[1:19:29] Sunday to the
[1:19:31] Lord Sunday is the
[1:19:34] Lord praise the name of when I wake up
[1:19:37] in the morning the things I'm doing in
[1:19:39] the morning they help me to be in the
[1:19:42] presence of
[1:19:44] God taking me from the
[1:19:47] Pres yeah he start finding
[1:19:50] out and you know God when he gives us
[1:19:55] he demands
[1:19:59] 10% just
[1:20:01] one out of 10 but even the one God
[1:20:06] demands out of the 10 you
[1:20:10] have
[1:20:12] no we are
[1:20:15] stewards so are we faithful
[1:20:18] stewards are we
[1:20:20] wise we say
[1:20:23] Lord you know i' I've labored a
[1:20:26] lot I went to
[1:20:28] school I was spending sleepless nights
[1:20:31] to
[1:20:33] read aot
[1:20:40] of this this this person to get this
[1:20:45] job you a
[1:20:47] steward because even before you could
[1:20:49] have the
[1:20:50] job God has given you the life you can
[1:20:54] have the job before you enter the office
[1:20:58] no
[1:20:59] more
[1:21:01] immediately they just remove
[1:21:03] you that's one thing I see with places
[1:21:06] of work you can be there a
[1:21:10] boss everybody worships
[1:21:13] you but notice time can just come when
[1:21:16] you have no more of
[1:21:19] that you have made a big plan
[1:21:25] but God says you fool I demand your soul
[1:21:30] and Jesus asks all that you've
[1:21:34] stored what would they help you we are
[1:21:38] stewards praise the name of our so David
[1:21:43] recognized that all anything he
[1:21:47] had every opportunity would get
[1:21:50] to it is the
[1:21:52] L and we should have also the same in
[1:21:56] mind whatever I
[1:21:58] have is
[1:22:00] the the life I have is the Lord the
[1:22:04] house I have is the L the I have is the
[1:22:07] L the family I have is the L I have is
[1:22:11] the L the business I have is the L the
[1:22:15] job I have is the L so when you realize
[1:22:18] that whatever you have is
[1:22:20] the you will fear and you will learn to
[1:22:24] be
[1:22:25] Faith what the Lord has

[1:35:17] water there is a Tre bending over your
[1:35:21] house any time it's going to fall
[1:35:24] you need your neighbor to come and cut
[1:35:26] for you
[1:35:32] the you can't help
[1:35:36] yourself praise the name of the Lord we
[1:35:39] need to take responsibility over what
[1:35:40] God has
[1:35:43] given and when there is a
[1:35:45] need you look at a
[1:35:47] need as
[1:35:50] opportunity to be blessed
[1:35:53] that's the thing look at a need which is
[1:35:56] there and take it as an opportunity for
[1:36:00] you to be blessed by the Lord and then
[1:36:03] you come and say I'm going to do
[1:36:06] this praise the name of and then you
[1:36:09] take it with
[1:36:10] joy I'm going to do this kind of I'm
[1:36:13] going to do this kind of I'm going to do
[1:36:15] this kind of praise the name of our Lord
[1:36:19] sometimes we have
[1:36:20] meetings and then we invite people to
[1:36:22] come
[1:36:25] praise the name of the Lord and
[1:36:26] sometimes we call we call on to support
[1:36:29] the kind of getting meal for that
[1:36:35] day but how many of us are
[1:36:38] concerned to
[1:36:40] take to
[1:36:42] contribute how many of us are
[1:36:46] concerned praise the name
[1:36:50] of if you were at home
[1:36:54] you mean you wouldn't
[1:36:57] eat and then we want to eat
[1:37:02] together I don't have money what do you
[1:37:04] eat at
[1:37:06] home prise the
[1:37:08] name you know I I've been going to a
[1:37:11] place in
[1:37:12] par I fa to go there on
[1:37:15] Friday I fa to go there on
[1:37:17] Thursday but last year because I got
[1:37:20] there once I go there for three days
[1:37:22] every month
[1:37:25] you have to get
[1:37:26] transport your fuel you have to get
[1:37:30] accommodation and these people had the
[1:37:34] culture when you going there for a
[1:37:39] meeting they want you to buy them
[1:37:43] food that's contrary to the
[1:37:47] scriptures the Bible says he that labors
[1:37:53] you the
[1:37:55] spiritual give him the
[1:37:57] natural then I went and preached thereon
[1:38:00] one
[1:38:02] day then I told them who of you can stay
[1:38:08] home and doesn't eat
[1:38:11] food but then why would you want me to
[1:38:14] come to bring you food when you are
[1:38:18] coming for the
[1:38:19] meeting you know it is the same thing
[1:38:22] you hosting a vis
[1:38:26] you V you come with your food how crazy
[1:38:29] is
[1:38:31] that praise the name of Lord but you see
[1:38:34] the devil puts us in that kind of
[1:38:37] condition and when we feel we are poor
[1:38:41] we can't do it and you
[1:38:43] poor because you are refusing the
[1:38:51] blessing but even what
[1:38:54] giving going to
[1:38:58] e but you don't want to
[1:39:01] give no praise the name of our Lord we
[1:39:04] need to change our
[1:39:06] attitudes when a call
[1:39:09] comes to come and
[1:39:12] support be willing to give the

[1:59:58] family you have a husband you have a
[2:00:01] wife you have children you have parents
[2:00:06] and then you travel your

[2:00:18] families when they have raised their
[2:00:20] children well
[2:00:23] you see the daughters bring men who are
[2:00:25] going to marry them at

[2:18:40] there are some who remember the last day

[2:18:48] month he can't give account for his
[2:18:54] time praise the name of now there was
[2:18:57] also another
[2:18:58] one we see s lost his
[2:19:05] stewardship now let us go to verse
[2:19:09] 23 for Rebellion is as the sin of
[2:19:13] Witchcraft and stubborness is as
[2:19:15] iniquity and adultery because you have
[2:19:17] rejected the word of the Lord he also
[2:19:20] has rejected Ed you from being King
[2:19:52] so he lost his
[2:19:55] stewardship because he was not
[2:19:58] faithful we can look at another example
[2:20:02] here about being a wise
[2:20:07] Steward like now God has made us
[2:20:10] stewards you need
[2:20:12] wisdom in your

[2:20:24] skills praise the name of the Lord you
[2:20:27] know as
[2:20:28] stewards praise the name of
[2:20:31] Lord let us go to First Kings
[2:20:38] 12 and then verse
[2:20:43] one the Bible
[2:20:46] says and rehoboam went to she for all
[2:20:50] Israel were come to shim to make him
[2:20:52] King and it came to pass when jeroboam
[2:20:55] the son of nabat who was yet in Egypt
[2:20:58] had of it for he was fled from the
[2:21:01] presence of King Solomon and jerob
[2:21:04] jeroboam dwelt in Egypt
[2:21:42] that they sent and called unto him and
[2:21:45] jeroboam and all the congregation of
[2:21:47] Israel came and spoke unto rehoboam
[2:21:50] saying thy father made our yoke Grievous
[2:21:54] now therefore make th the Grievous
[2:21:56] service of thy father and his heavy yoke
[2:21:59] which he put Upon Us lighter and we will
[2:22:02] serve thee
[2:22:22] [Music]
[2:22:44] that's what they
[2:22:46] required we have Heaven Lords as king
[2:22:50] asking the
[2:22:53] king our light We Shall Serve
[2:22:57] You So
[2:23:00] what he went to the wise
[2:23:04] men who were wise who were giving
[2:23:07] counsel to his
[2:23:10] father now you can imagine Solomon as
[2:23:14] the wisest man on
[2:23:17] Earth he hadel
[2:23:21] how interesting it is
[2:23:23] wisest people are giving him
[2:23:26] C so now when reob went to the wise men
[2:23:30] who were in the days of his
[2:23:34] father he asked them in verse six and
[2:23:38] the King rehoboam consulted the old man
[2:23:41] that stood before Solomon his father
[2:23:44] while he yet lived and said how do you
[2:23:47] advise that I may answer these people
[2:24:06] and then the wise
[2:24:09] men they told
[2:24:12] him if you will be a servant unto these
[2:24:16] people this
[2:24:18] day and will serve them and answer them
[2:24:23] then speak good words to
[2:24:26] them they will be servants for you
[2:24:30] forever that's what the wise men were
[2:24:33] telling that what you do accept what
[2:24:37] they
[2:24:38] saying
[2:24:39] now hadow young
[2:24:43] men who had grown up with
[2:24:46] him who were playing with him and then
[2:24:49] he went those very young men and then he
[2:24:52] asked
[2:24:53] them and said what should I
[2:24:56] do so the Bible says in
[2:24:59] verse but he for the coun of the old
[2:25:04] men which they had given him and
[2:25:07] consulted with the young men that were
[2:25:09] grown up with
[2:25:12] him and which stood before
[2:25:15] him and he said unto them what can give
[2:25:19] you that I may answer these
[2:25:25] people who have spoken to me saying make
[2:25:27] the Yoke which father put on us
[2:25:34] later and the young men that grown up
[2:25:37] with him spoke unto him
[2:25:42] saying th shall you make these people
[2:25:45] that speak unto you saying
[2:25:51] thy father made your yoke
[2:25:56] heavy but make it light to
[2:25:59] us shall you sayto
[2:26:03] them my little
[2:26:08] finger shall be thicker than my father's
[2:26:14] Lo
[2:26:16] see the wise men have told him
[2:26:21] allow accept it the youth he grew up
[2:26:26] with now when we come to the
[2:26:31] ministry as somebody who is running in
[2:26:33] the
[2:26:35] ministry or you have
[2:26:38] started you also go to other people have
[2:26:43] started
[2:26:48] them that's what
[2:26:50] was
[2:26:52] doing he despised the wisdom of those
[2:26:55] who advised his
[2:26:59] father and he went with the wisdom of
[2:27:01] the fellow
[2:27:04] young now like you find a
[2:27:08] sister she has just got married and
[2:27:12] she's asking not
[2:27:15] married sisters who are not
[2:27:18] married people are failing in their

[2:27:35] who has just
[2:27:37] started advice can you can give you you
[2:27:41] go to somebody who has been in that
[2:27:44] thing and will tell you the story you do
[2:27:50] you do as a young man you've married a
[2:27:53] wife then you go fellow youth married my
[2:27:57] wife she was telling me this and
[2:28:01] this no no don't do that the man has

[2:28:17] kingdom he lost the stewardship
[2:28:21] when those people came back to
[2:28:23] him and he told him he told
[2:28:27] him my small
[2:28:31] finger shall be thicker than Lo of my
[2:28:36] father you know what they say what do we
[2:28:39] have in
[2:28:40] David the 10 tribes left the
[2:28:47] kingdom he lost his stewardship
[2:28:51] so now in whatever stewardship we
[2:28:54] have we need to be
[2:28:57] faithful and
[2:28:59] wise praise the name of Lord see that
[2:29:02] you seek right

[2:29:58] was he rejected the of the old
[2:30:03] men and he lost most of the
[2:30:06] Kingdom he lost most of

[2:37:42] score this is a weak point this keeper
[2:37:46] knows how to dive
[2:37:47] left so if I'm going to
[2:37:51] go a problem this keeper knows how to
[2:37:54] jump so if I'm going toore put it
[2:37:58] down they go and
[2:38:01] study praise the name of Lord so even me
[2:38:04] I
[2:38:05] go like I've preached a certain
[2:38:08] subject maybe it has not been a little
[2:38:10] bit
[2:38:12] clear how does this one handle that even
[2:38:15] I
[2:38:16] call there is this and this there
[2:38:18] something I'm not
[2:38:20] understanding oh I've read the thing in
[2:38:23] the scripture how does brother talk
[2:38:25] about
[2:38:26] this this kind of word what does it
[2:38:30] mean I'm trying to
[2:38:35] enrich praise the name of I'm a
[2:38:38] worker go for further
[2:38:42] training say my degree is
[2:38:45] enough maybe what you learned is no
[2:38:47] longer applicable
[2:38:50] so there is continuous
[2:38:53] training continuous professional
[2:38:58] development so you keep on
[2:39:00] learning that makes you relevant at your
[2:39:03] place of
[2:39:04] work how about your preaching if every
[2:39:08] we come and preach the same
[2:39:11] thing when are we moving over from
[2:39:15] here praise the name of I'm a musician
[2:39:19] let me learn new
[2:39:21] skills this one okay this is better why
[2:39:24] is this voice not coming out time praise
[2:39:28] the name of the Lord now the scripture
[2:39:30] we have read it says that these people
[2:39:33] were given
[2:39:35] money they didn't ask them for
[2:39:39] accountability why because they were
[2:39:43] faithful in other words the work that
[2:39:46] they
[2:39:47] did just give the
[2:39:53] account now you ask that where why do
[2:39:55] you ask where the m has G you see all
[2:39:57] the things so even what he has done is
[2:40:01] more than what we gave
[2:40:05] him that's how we need to be at our
[2:40:10] Steward as a steward as a father do more
[2:40:15] than a
[2:40:16] father mother do more than a mother
[2:40:20] as a husband no more than a husband as a
[2:40:23] wife more than a wife whatever God do
[2:40:27] put you
[2:40:28] into do
[2:40:31] excellen that when somebody
[2:40:33] comes what you have done talks for
[2:40:38] itself praise the name of
[2:40:41] for not you know like in
[2:40:44] construction they give you
[2:40:47] materials when boss is
[2:40:50] away some you put on money and other
[2:40:55] buses you mix the ratio mixing is
[2:41:00] poor by the time you go to hand over the
[2:41:03] building the cracks have started
[2:41:06] coming is
[2:41:08] it but the Bible says they didn't
[2:41:11] require these people to give
[2:41:15] accountability because what they did was
[2:41:18] right
[2:41:20] what they did was
[2:41:22] faithful praise the name as
[2:41:26] Christians what is our
[2:41:29] conduct that's our
[2:41:33] accountability I'm born again let them
[2:41:36] look at your conduct does it
[2:41:40] account what you believe because they
[2:41:43] has to be a physical
[2:41:45] discipline what you do
[2:41:50] you have been in a
[2:41:51] business one year at the beginning you
[2:41:55] started the sh are
[2:41:58] full at end of
[2:42:01] they they will not ask you
[2:42:06] they the next time even rent will be
[2:42:08] difficult to
[2:42:10] pay but when they see you you
[2:42:13] started you started with just a few
[2:42:15] things on the
[2:42:16] store at the end of the year the shop is
[2:42:20] full next year thinking of increasing
[2:42:24] the
[2:42:26] space then you are diligent in
[2:42:29] your praise the name of our this is what
[2:42:32] the Lord wants us to
[2:42:34] be if I'm a Christian let me be a better
[2:42:38] Christian and that's what you should
[2:42:40] strive to be a better
[2:42:43] Christian all the time praise the name
[2:42:46] of our Lord now in the message awaken
[2:42:52] Awakening
[2:42:54] Jesus now God chose to use
[2:42:59] man now he could have chose to use the
[2:43:02] son to preach the
[2:43:04] gospel he could have chose to use the
[2:43:06] wind to preach the
[2:43:08] gospel he could have chose the Stars he
[2:43:11] could choose anything he
[2:43:14] wanted but he chose
[2:43:17] man praise the name of our Lord and
[2:43:21] somebody is going to do
[2:43:23] it that is right somebody if he could
[2:43:27] just ever find a
[2:43:30] man one man that he could get in his
[2:43:35] hand he will do it he's had such a hard
[2:43:39] time to finding one
[2:43:43] man I think of
[2:43:45] Samson he found a man with plenty of
[2:43:48] strength
[2:43:51] and Samson dedicated his strength to
[2:43:54] God but he wouldn't give his
[2:43:57] heart he gave his heart
[2:44:00] to God wants your heart your strength
[2:44:06] your soul your body your mind all you
[2:44:11] got it's the only way he can use
[2:44:15] you use the whole man
[2:44:19] praise the name of our Lord and as
[2:44:22] stewards let us give everything we
[2:44:25] have to the services of the Lord praise
[2:44:28] the name of the be a faithful
[2:44:31] Steward praise the name of the Lord be a
[2:44:34] diligent
[2:44:37] Steward praise the name of the Lord let
[2:44:39] us go in this message
[2:44:42] demonology brother Bram says I take it
[2:44:47] myself and before God
[2:44:50] as my
[2:44:52] judge I put it in the gospel work
[2:44:57] Yonder so I know that one
[2:45:01] day that when I will have to give an
[2:45:05] account for my
[2:45:08] stewardship it's given
[2:45:11] correctly that is exactly right because
[2:45:15] I realize as I treat the people I'm
[2:45:19] treating
[2:45:20] God just my
[2:45:23] attitude towards you is my
[2:45:27] attitude towards Christ and your
[2:45:30] attitude towards me is the same
[2:45:34] thing so brother Bram says you will have
[2:45:38] to give
[2:45:40] accountability we also have to give
[2:45:42] accountability for all our
[2:45:45] stewardship the responsibility God has
[2:45:47] given
[2:45:49] for your life for your family for your
[2:45:52] place of work and for the work of the
[2:45:54] kingdom of we have to give
[2:45:57] accountability then in the
[2:46:00] message says and
[2:46:03] now it will be used for overseas
[2:46:08] mission was receiving
[2:46:11] money and whatever money he would
[2:46:13] receive would pick a little for himself
[2:46:17] and the rest of what he would receive
[2:46:21] would put it into the
[2:46:23] missions to send it over to the
[2:46:26] different missionaries in different
[2:46:29] places and then he says I give it for
[2:46:32] the missionary
[2:46:34] fields and preach to the people that
[2:46:38] hasn't got one
[2:46:40] penny over there missionaries preaching
[2:46:43] the
[2:46:45] gospel no shoes on
[2:46:48] no sh preaching the gospel and now you
[2:46:53] would expect people like that to sponsor
[2:46:55] a
[2:46:58] meeting they couldn't do it how could
[2:47:01] they send for me to come over there and
[2:47:04] go
[2:47:07] back remember your money that you put in
[2:47:13] will go for that
[2:47:15] purpose to help save those that Jesus
[2:47:18] died for
[2:47:20] and I know that when it is put in my
[2:47:24] heart I am a steward of
[2:47:27] that and then from then and God will
[2:47:31] make me
[2:47:32] answer for it at the day of
[2:47:36] judgment make me to answer so I want to
[2:47:40] be a good
