[26:09] I precious heavenly
[26:13] father, we are so grateful Lord
[26:16] to be in your presence this evening.
[26:21] It's our humble
[26:23] prayer that you may lead us through the
[26:26] valley, the shadows of
[26:29] death that Lord even when death appears
[26:33] before
[26:35] us that we may have the confidence, the
[26:39] courage to face
[26:41] it knowing that you are with us and
[26:44] you're close to
[26:46] us. That's the prayer of everyone this
[26:49] evening, Lord.
[26:52] that you may always walk close to us,
[26:56] Father, as we walk close to
[27:00] you. Give us that special
[27:03] grace, that even when we wander far away
[27:06] from
[27:08] you, that we may always listen to the
[27:10] still small
[27:13] voice that calls us to come back
[27:16] home. that we may continue a closer walk
[27:20] with
[27:21] you until we cross over. Oh
[27:25] God, I commit myself
[27:29] tonight. And Lord, I commit my
[27:33] spirit that Father, it may be aligned to
[27:36] thy
[27:39] thought that you may align my spirit and
[27:42] your
[27:45] thought. As I yield, Father, to be used
[27:49] as a
[27:51] vessel, you speak the purchase of blood.
[27:56] These are a worthy
[27:58] people that you have purchased with your
[28:00] own
[28:02] blood. And it takes your blood, oh
[28:05] God, to sanctify me and cleanse
[28:10] me that I may be presented
[28:14] worthy that I may be presented
[28:19] worthy to speak your word
[28:22] tonight. I therefore pray,
[28:25] Father, that through your blood, oh
[28:28] God, you may hide me behind this
[28:32] veil, and hide me, oh
[28:35] God, that you may come to the
[28:39] surface and do the speaking of thy word
[28:43] this. I pray for every soul
[28:46] tonight that you may bless
[28:49] them, those that are struggling to
[28:51] overcome
[28:55] may give them the
[28:57] courage and the strength to stand like
[29:02] Joshua to stand still like
[29:05] Joshua to be see the salvation of the
[29:09] Lord. Bless us Lord as we listen thy
[29:13] word that this word may be
[29:17] born in the maj of our
[29:19] hearts to help us live
[29:23] worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[29:27] I commit it all to
[29:29] you in the most precious name of Jesus
[29:33] Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[29:38] Amen. and are you happy to be here this
[29:41] evening? Amen. It's such a great
[29:44] evening and we appreciate
[29:48] God for once again the
[29:52] opportunity for us to be gathered
[29:56] here to share about his
[29:59] word. Amen. Amen. I don't know what to
[30:02] speak to you
[30:05] tonight, but I trust that the Lord is
[30:09] gracious and he knows each one of our
[30:13] prayers and each of our
[30:16] needs and he shall speak to our needs
[30:18] this
[30:21] evening. Amen. Amen. We want to
[30:24] appreciate God for our
[30:27] pastor. Amen. He's behind there.
[30:31] Amen. Amen. So let's turn to the book of
[30:35] Revelations chapter
[30:39] 3 and read verse
[30:43] 20 to
[30:48] 21. Behold, I stand at the door and
[30:53] knock. If any man hear my voice and open
[30:57] the door, I'll come into him and will s
[31:00] with him and he with me.
[31:19] To him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[31:22] sit with me in my throne, even
[31:25] as I also overcame, and I'm set down
[31:30] with my father in his throne.
[31:46] Let's turn to John
[31:53] 16:33. These things I have spoken unto
[31:57] you, that in me you might have peace. In
[32:01] the world you shall have tribulation,
[32:04] but be of good cheer. I have overcome
[32:06] the world.
[32:22] May the Lord bless his word. We may all
[32:24] be
[32:27] seated. Amen. Amen. So I want to share
[32:30] with
[32:31] you on the
[32:34] text, how do we
[32:38] overcome? It's a
[32:40] question. How do we
[32:43] overcome? And overcoming many things.
[32:51] overcoming
[32:53] troubles, overcoming trials,
[32:57] overcoming persecutions,
[33:00] overcoming sickness,
[33:04] overcoming
[33:06] sin, how do we
[33:09] overcome? So now Jesus
[33:13] when he was speaking to the church ages
[33:18] In Revelation 3 where we
[33:21] read, he said, "Behold, I stand at the
[33:24] door and
[33:26] knock. If any man hear my
[33:30] voice and open the door, I'll come to
[33:34] him. I'll come into
[33:37] him. Praise the Lord. And will s with
[33:40] him and he with me."
[33:43] So he gives us the first
[33:46] answer to open the doors of our
[33:51] hearts. Praise the Lord that if you hear
[33:55] the
[33:56] voice, if you hear the
[33:59] word, if you hear the voice of the Lord
[34:05] speaking, he said it is I standing at
[34:08] the door.
[34:11] Jesus Christ. And then he said, "You
[34:13] don't just
[34:15] hear when you open the door of your
[34:19] heart. I will come into
[34:22] you and I will s with
[34:25] you and you with
[34:27] me. And then says to him who has
[34:31] heard, who has opened the
[34:34] door, who has
[34:37] listened, who allowed me
[34:40] in. And to him that
[34:44] overcomes, I will grant him to sit with
[34:48] me in my throne. So it starts with
[34:51] hearing the
[34:53] voice. It starts with obedience to the
[34:57] voice. It starts by
[35:00] welcoming the Lord in our
[35:03] lives. Praise the Lord. But how do we
[35:07] overcome? We cannot overcome on our on
[35:10] our
[35:11] own because we are
[35:14] weak. We can be
[35:16] beatated. Praise the Lord. We can only
[35:20] overcome by Jesus Christ.
[35:23] Praise the Lord. And now in John
[35:28] 16:33 he say remember I have these
[35:31] things I have spoken unto
[35:34] you that in me you might have
[35:39] peace. So now when we open the
[35:42] door and then he comes in and he settles
[35:47] in then he gives us the
[35:50] peace because he becomes the master of
[35:53] our
[35:54] lives where everything is under
[35:58] control because he lives
[36:01] within. So now he said that when that
[36:05] happens you will have
[36:08] peace because you have
[36:10] me and you are in me and in the world
[36:16] you shall have
[36:18] tribulation. It's not saying that when
[36:20] you come to
[36:21] me you'll be free from
[36:25] tribulations from
[36:27] troubles. You'll be free from troubles.
[36:31] The troubles will still be
[36:34] there. The troubles will still
[36:37] come. But the most important thing
[36:40] here is for us to be in
[36:44] him, when we are in him and the troubles
[36:47] are all around us.
[36:50] have that
[36:51] peace because we know that he that lives
[36:54] in
[36:56] us is greater and
[36:59] stronger than he that is causing
[37:01] troubles in the
[37:03] world. He says in me you shall have
[37:06] peace and in the world you shall have
[37:09] tribulation but be of good
[37:13] cheer. Why? Because I have overcome the
[37:17] world.
[37:18] So now how do we
[37:20] overcome? We overcome because Jesus
[37:22] Christ overcome the world for
[37:26] us. If you're able to
[37:28] overcome, I am able to
[37:31] overcome. I have him in my
[37:34] life. So as long as he's in my
[37:37] life, I have the capacity and ability to
[37:40] overcome the world.
[37:43] First John
[37:47] 4:4 of God little
[37:50] children. You are of You are of God
[37:52] little
[37:54] children. You can read that scripture 1
[37:57] John
[38:01] 4:4 and have overcome
[38:04] them. You've overcome all the
[38:07] trials. You overcome
[38:09] sin. You overcome temptation.
[38:13] sickness and all them
[38:15] things. Why? Not because you are
[38:18] powerful.
[38:20] Not because you are born
[38:23] stronger, but simply because greater is
[38:26] he that is in
[38:29] you than he that is in the
[38:32] world. He says in the world you shall
[38:36] suffer. As long as you're in the
[38:38] world, suffering shall come.
[38:42] But again, as long as you have
[38:45] me, you have peace because I have
[38:50] overcome. I never said, "I've overcome
[38:53] some of them." He never said, "I've
[38:56] overcome some of
[38:58] them." He said, "I have
[39:01] overcome." He literally overcame
[39:07] everything. Praise the Lord. He overcame
[39:09] every
[39:11] challenge. He overcame every
[39:15] temptation. Jesus overcame everything
[39:18] that will ever happen to us in the
[39:21] world. As long as we are of
[39:24] him, as long as we are in him, we
[39:28] overcome
[39:29] them. We have the ability to
[39:32] overcome, not by power, not by
[39:36] might, but by the
[39:39] spirit that dwelleth in us. Praise the
[39:43] living God. And I want to read
[39:46] here in the message, the
[39:50] communion
[39:53] 1957. And it's a good
[39:55] thing that men and women of this earth
[39:59] stop in livong
[40:02] travel
[40:03] stop in life's long
[40:09] travel they as they walking
[40:12] along that you you
[40:17] pause and talk it with and talk it over
[40:20] with
[40:21] Jesus as you are going through the
[40:27] troubles. What Jesus said, in me shall
[40:30] have
[40:31] peace, but the troubles will still
[40:35] come. Praise the Lord. Will you have
[40:38] peace in the world you shall have
[40:41] tribulation in the world you shall have
[40:44] suffering in the world. You shall face
[40:47] battles. Praise the Lord. He said, "As
[40:51] long as you have me,
[40:53] There shall be
[40:55] peace. It shall prevail in your
[40:57] heart because you know you have the
[41:01] warrior. The one that fights all the
[41:03] battles that are
[41:06] coming. Now here the prophet says. It's
[41:09] a good thing that in these
[41:12] battles in these
[41:14] challenges that we stop over in
[41:18] life and then we start talk it over with
[41:21] Jesus.
[41:23] and then you speak with him. Why?
[41:27] Because that's where we draw our
[41:29] peace. That's where we draw our
[41:32] assurance. If we are able to
[41:36] overcome these troubles that come our
[41:40] way. Why? Because he said
[41:43] it. It is thus says the
[41:45] Lord that what Jesus
[41:48] spoke and every word that he spoke never
[41:51] fails.
[41:53] That's why the prophet
[41:55] says the troules shall
[41:58] come. But in the midst of the
[42:02] rage, we ought to stop
[42:05] over. You pause and then
[42:10] remember is Jesus in your
[42:13] life. Then you carry it
[42:16] over and start to speak with him about
[42:19] it. And then you begin to have communion
[42:21] with
[42:23] him in a
[42:25] fellowship. Then the battle
[42:28] begins. Praise the Lord. He said, "But
[42:32] when you have
[42:33] me, the battles will come." So the Bible
[42:36] says then when you stop over and start
[42:38] having communion with Christ
[42:45] where where we started
[42:47] from behold I stand at the door and
[42:50] knock. Now when you open the door of
[42:53] your
[42:54] heart and then you he comes in then he
[42:57] gives you the peace and the
[43:00] assurance and then his peace rules over.
[43:05] The enemy is not
[43:08] satisfied because he has lost
[43:10] you. So he has to fight so hard to pull
[43:13] you over back to the
[43:17] world. That's why the Bible says in me
[43:19] you have
[43:21] peace. But yet in the world there shall
[43:24] be
[43:26] tribulations. The enemy does not want to
[43:28] lose
[43:30] you. He still chases over
[43:33] you. If he looks over
[43:36] you
[43:38] says the children of
[43:41] God, we are going to assemble
[43:44] together. Satan also went with
[43:48] them. And then he saw a one
[43:51] job who was a faithful
[43:55] servant,
[43:57] perfect. Praise the Lord. said I have to
[44:01] go over
[44:02] him. So each time we are
[44:05] gathering, each time we open the doors
[44:08] of our
[44:10] hearts
[44:12] in Satan is always chasing after
[44:18] us. He chases after your
[44:21] family. He chases after your
[44:24] salvation. He chases after your
[44:27] job. Praise the Lord.
[44:29] says after your
[44:31] peace take away that
[44:33] peace. Praise the Lord. Now the prophet
[44:37] says the moment Christ comes
[44:40] in then the test the battle
[44:43] begins. The battle of
[44:46] testing because there is a
[44:48] battle between the two. There is always
[44:52] a white
[44:53] dog and a black dog. The prophet
[44:56] preached that
[44:57] message. Praise the Lord. The black one
[45:00] is always
[45:02] there also wants to feed from your
[45:06] table. But the white one is also
[45:09] there also wants to feed from your
[45:12] table. And as long as we are in this
[45:16] bodies, that still
[45:21] continues. In me shall have
[45:24] peace. In the world you shall have
[45:26] tribulation.
[45:29] Because the devil has to look after
[45:32] you to fight to make sure that he takes
[45:35] you
[45:37] back. He says battles
[45:40] begin testing and
[45:44] trying. Every
[45:46] son that
[45:48] comes to God must be
[45:51] tested. But how do we overcome
[45:54] them? by the blood of the
[45:57] lamb, by the power of the
[46:01] testimony, the testimony that he lives
[46:04] in
[46:05] us. Praise the Lord. overcome him by the
[46:08] blood of the
[46:10] lamb and the
[46:12] testimony that he lives. The
[46:16] testimony of Jesus Christ lives in
[46:19] us. The testimony that he that lives in
[46:23] us is stronger than he that is the
[46:27] world. He that lives in us is stronger
[46:31] than the
[46:32] battles that come our way. That's how we
[46:36] are able to
[46:37] overcome. Let's talk about
[46:40] Joshua. After Moses had
[46:43] died, God appointed him and God visited
[46:47] him.
[46:49] And in 1:1,
[46:53] after the death of Moses, the servant of
[46:55] the
[46:57] Lord, it came to
[46:59] pass that the Lord spoke unto Joshua,
[47:02] the son of Non, Moses's minister,
[47:23] saying Moses my servant is dead. Now
[47:26] therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
[47:28] thou and all these people, and to the
[47:30] land which I do give to them, even to
[47:33] the children of Israel.
[47:54] That's the word of the
[47:55] Lord. It came to Joshua. And in verse
[48:00] three, he gives him the
[48:02] promise. The way he has given us the
[48:05] promise. Praise the Lord. That in the
[48:08] world we shall have
[48:11] tribulation. We are in him. We have
[48:14] peace and then he give us another
[48:17] assurance that we have overcome the
[48:20] world because he has overcome for
[48:24] us. Then he is here giving a promise
[48:26] unto
[48:28] Joshua. He says every place that the
[48:30] soul of th of your foot shall tread
[48:38] upon that I have given unto you as I did
[48:41] unto Moses.
[48:45] from the
[48:47] wilderness and this
[48:49] Lebanon, even unto the great
[48:53] river, all the land of the
[48:59] Hittites, and unto the great sea toward
[49:02] the going down of the sun.
[49:08] There shall not any man be able to stand
[49:11] before you all the days of your life.
[49:20] [Music]
[49:25] That is a
[49:26] promise. Praise the Lord. How was he
[49:29] going to take conquer the
[49:32] land? He was going the
[49:35] land upon the promise that God had
[49:40] given. God had given a
[49:43] promise and he spoke to him the
[49:46] promise and says as I was with
[49:50] Moses I will be with
[49:53] you I will not fail
[49:55] you nor forsake
[49:58] you and then says you have heard this
[50:02] promise now be strong and of good
[50:08] courage for unto these people shall thou
[50:11] provide an inheritance the
[50:16] land. Be of good
[50:18] courage. Be
[50:20] strong. Praise the Lord overcome
[50:24] them because
[50:27] greater is he that is in you than he
[50:30] that is in the
[50:32] world. Therefore, when trouble
[50:36] comes, when when pain comes,
[50:41] When sickness
[50:42] comes, when troubles come and trials
[50:47] come, be strong and of good
[50:51] courage. Why? Because he has given us
[50:53] the
[50:54] promise that we overcome
[50:57] them because he is in us. So now the
[51:01] question is, have you received
[51:04] him? So now if you have received him as
[51:08] your personal savior,
[51:10] Jesus that promise that as long as you
[51:13] have
[51:15] me, you shall overcome the world.
[51:19] Only be thou
[51:21] strong and of good
[51:23] courage. Only be thou
[51:26] strong and very
[51:29] courageous that thou may observe to do
[51:33] according to the
[51:36] law.
[51:45] Listen, God gave a
[51:48] promise and he had given the promise to
[51:51] Moses. It was the same
[51:54] promise had been given to
[51:57] Abraham. Praise the Lord. 400 years
[52:01] before this
[52:03] generation and God was was maintaining
[52:07] the same
[52:09] promise. The same promise he spoke to
[52:13] Abraham, the same
[52:15] promise that he spoke to
[52:18] Moses and now Moses is
[52:20] gone. God never changed his
[52:23] promise. He maintained the same
[52:27] promise when he was speaking to Joshua.
[52:32] But then he tells Joshua,
[52:34] only be thou strong and very
[52:38] courageous, that you may open to do
[52:41] according to all the law which Moses thy
[52:44] servant commanded thee.
[52:51] through you shall overcome the
[52:54] world. But how will you overcome the
[52:57] world?
[52:58] Praise the Lord. Not because you know
[53:01] the
[53:02] word. Not because you know the
[53:05] message, not because you've heard the
[53:08] message. Praise the Lord. Because you
[53:11] have him in your
[53:13] life. And then you
[53:16] observe to do according to his word.
[53:21] How you have faith in the
[53:24] word says only be thou strong and very
[53:30] courageous. How do you exercise your
[53:33] strength is to maintain
[53:37] calmness and to keep your
[53:40] face in the finished
[53:43] work in the midst of the
[53:46] storms. He says, "Only be thou strong
[53:49] and
[53:51] courageous that you may
[53:54] observe to do according to the
[54:00] law. Turn not from
[54:07] it to the right of the
[54:10] left that thou may prosper."
[54:16] Praise the Lord. And then he says, "Have
[54:19] I not commanded
[54:21] thee? Have I not commanded?" Verse
[54:26] 9. Therefore, be
[54:29] strong. Have I not spoken unto thee that
[54:33] you have overcome the
[54:35] world? Because he that is in you is
[54:39] greater than he that is in the world.
[54:43] Therefore, be strong and of good
[54:47] courage. Be not
[54:49] afraid. In me shall have
[54:52] peace. In the world you shall face
[54:56] tribulations, in the midst of these
[54:59] tribulations, remain my
[55:03] word. Have I not commanded you?
[55:07] Have I not given you the promise?
[55:10] Praise the Lord.
[55:12] You shall
[55:14] overcome because I live in
[55:17] you and I am greater than he that is in
[55:20] the
[55:21] world. That's the same thing he was
[55:23] speaking to
[55:24] Joshua. The first gives us the
[55:28] promise. He gives us the
[55:30] promise. He gives us the word. And after
[55:34] he has given us his
[55:36] promise, he sets us up.
[55:40] Praise the Lord.
[55:41] Now he's very
[55:43] sure that by the same
[55:46] promise and the word which he has given
[55:48] unto
[55:50] us, we are able to overcome the
[55:53] world. Why? Because each time trouble
[55:58] comes. We have our reference
[56:04] point when battles
[56:07] rage. We have our reference point.
[56:11] And what is the reference
[56:13] point? The reference point is the word
[56:16] of
[56:19] God. And what does the word of God
[56:22] say? Little
[56:24] children. Be of good
[56:26] courage. You have overcome the
[56:29] world. Because he that lives in you is
[56:33] greater than he that is in the
[56:35] world. Praise the Lord. Which amount of
[56:38] travel
[56:41] can fail our
[56:44] faith. Which amount of
[56:47] problem? Which amount of
[56:49] challenge? Praise the Lord. Amount of
[56:54] testing can fail our faith in the
[56:58] word. He has provided for all of
[57:02] it. Praise the Lord.
[57:05] still read in this message as I was with
[57:09] Moses
[57:11] 1960. I want you to
[57:13] notice what taken place.
[57:17] Joshua when he come to his first
[57:21] campaign to prove that he was the real
[57:24] Joshua.
[57:32] Israel ought to have known
[57:36] that no
[57:39] doubt had a different idea.
[57:43] The
[57:45] clergy they
[57:49] said they said now we will now just
[57:57] come here until springtime.
[58:04] We'll just come here until springtime or
[58:07] till summer
[58:12] time. The Jordan will go
[58:16] down and look like God throws some of
[58:19] the most foolish things in front of the
[58:21] spiritual Joshua.
[58:35] brought him before brought him there in
[58:37] the month of of
[58:40] April. April in the month of April
[58:45] when the Jordan was three or four times
[58:48] in its
[58:51] size, he was trying him to see if he
[58:54] really was the the Joshua.
[58:59] Let everything go
[59:02] wrong. Let everybody else
[59:08] prosper. Let the others
[59:12] prosper. Let the men who have a form of
[59:17] godliness. Deny the power
[59:20] thereof prosper and shove you back.
[59:34] um prosper and shove you
[59:38] back. But if you know where you
[59:44] stand, you will surely
[59:47] stand
[59:49] regardless. If the world, the whole
[59:51] world turns you
[59:54] down, you will stand just the
[59:58] same, you won't b from the
[1:00:03] word.
[1:00:06] Amen. Because you have received the
[1:00:09] word and you know your position in the
[1:00:13] word. You know what the word says about
[1:00:16] your life.
[1:00:19] You know what the word says about your
[1:00:22] troubles. You know what the word says
[1:00:24] about your
[1:00:26] sickness. I am the Lord God that health
[1:00:28] all your
[1:00:31] diseases. Praise the Lord. I am the Lord
[1:00:35] God. Come because I am with you.
[1:00:39] So you know your
[1:00:41] position and if you will
[1:00:44] stand you know exactly where to
[1:00:48] stand. You will stand regardless of what
[1:00:51] the world says about
[1:00:54] you. You'll stand just the
[1:00:58] same and you won't vary from the
[1:01:01] word. Praise the living God.
[1:01:05] He says Joshua reached over
[1:01:08] Jordan after now he has moved
[1:01:11] over and says it was around
[1:01:15] April when the river was
[1:01:19] overflowing and the river was
[1:01:23] raging. Praise the Lord. Now it was a
[1:01:26] testing
[1:01:28] moment, testing the faiths of
[1:01:32] people and to also prove whether this is
[1:01:36] the real
[1:01:42] Joshua that the word of the Lord had
[1:01:45] come
[1:01:47] unto these troubles will come in a
[1:01:49] perfect
[1:01:52] season. Praise the Lord. proves whether
[1:01:55] you are the
[1:01:57] elect. God has chosen by his
[1:02:01] word to prove whether you will stand the
[1:02:04] test of
[1:02:06] time with the word as your reference
[1:02:10] point with the word as your
[1:02:13] anchor. So when sin
[1:02:16] arises, when the battles
[1:02:19] arise, when challenges
[1:02:22] arise, you are coming to try out your
[1:02:25] faith and your stand in the
[1:02:30] word to prove whether you it is the real
[1:02:35] you in which the Lord
[1:02:39] dwelleth. And now Joshua, he held fast
[1:02:44] the
[1:02:46] word which God spoke to
[1:02:49] him. He was led by the
[1:02:52] word and he let the word lead
[1:02:56] him. So what did he do? He closed his
[1:03:00] ears of the noise of the
[1:03:03] people. The people looked at the
[1:03:07] river. Oh, it was overflowing.
[1:03:11] We cannot cross over
[1:03:12] there. And the prophet somewhere he
[1:03:16] said there were great men
[1:03:19] there were great engineers in the
[1:03:24] group and says maybe they came and spoke
[1:03:26] to Joshua and
[1:03:29] said Joshua we know the
[1:03:32] principle we have studied this physics
[1:03:34] very
[1:03:35] well. The moment you put your foot in
[1:03:39] there, the rivers will sweep you
[1:03:43] over. We can sit and
[1:03:46] wait until Jordan
[1:03:50] rise and he shall cross
[1:03:53] over. That is what was in their
[1:03:56] mind because it is what the world had
[1:03:59] taught
[1:04:01] them.
[1:04:02] Joshua, he had been taught different.
[1:04:07] He had given a
[1:04:09] promise and the promise was that he had
[1:04:11] to cross over Jordan
[1:04:17] anyhow. When sickness comes your way
[1:04:20] when trouble comes your
[1:04:22] way to look at it
[1:04:29] differently. You cannot get over
[1:04:32] this
[1:04:34] cancer. And it is it is already known
[1:04:36] that there's no choice for
[1:04:39] cancer. Yet you have a different
[1:04:43] teaching. You have a promise that I am
[1:04:46] the Lord
[1:04:49] God. Heals all your
[1:04:51] diseases. By my stripes you are
[1:04:54] healed. So now where will you stand in
[1:04:57] the that moment of time?
[1:05:01] You know where exactly to
[1:05:04] stand like Joshua, you choose to stand
[1:05:08] with the word of
[1:05:09] God and stand with the promise that God
[1:05:12] has given in his
[1:05:15] word. Whatever that strikes your
[1:05:18] way when you in
[1:05:21] luck and now the rest of the
[1:05:23] people are prospering like the prophet
[1:05:26] said,
[1:05:29] You get dismayed in your
[1:05:31] heart. And maybe the rest of the
[1:05:35] group with which you have grown up
[1:05:38] with or studied
[1:05:41] with maybe they have all got
[1:05:44] jobs and they are doing greatly
[1:05:47] well and then you look at
[1:05:50] yourself and then you look like you are
[1:05:52] you you are
[1:05:54] defeated. Praise the Lord. God is not
[1:05:59] caring. Maybe he has put you at a
[1:06:02] spot to increase and prove your faith in
[1:06:05] his
[1:06:07] words. Where will you
[1:06:09] stand? Praise the
[1:06:11] Lord. School
[1:06:14] fees and the time has come for
[1:06:17] exams. You have no school fees. Your
[1:06:21] children are being sent from from from
[1:06:23] school.
[1:06:25] Where will your faith
[1:06:28] stand? Praise the Lord. We have only one
[1:06:32] position. We have one reference
[1:06:35] point in the midst of all these
[1:06:38] troubles and that is the unfailing word
[1:06:41] of
[1:06:43] God. Say the
[1:06:45] word, he shall keep the
[1:06:48] word. Only be thou
[1:06:52] strong be thou courageous.
[1:06:55] Turn not
[1:06:57] away from this
[1:06:59] promise. Turn not away from this word
[1:07:04] because it is your
[1:07:07] anchor. Joshua stood with the
[1:07:10] word. Even when they shouted at
[1:07:13] him, he looked at them because he
[1:07:19] personally had received this word from
[1:07:22] God.
[1:07:25] You
[1:07:26] personally, you
[1:07:28] personally receive this
[1:07:32] promise. You have a personal experience
[1:07:35] with the
[1:07:37] word. You know how God has helped you
[1:07:40] maneuver all
[1:07:43] life. And now he has built a testimony
[1:07:46] in your
[1:07:48] life. And now when this trouble
[1:07:52] comes, even if it is too
[1:07:54] big, you look at what God has done for
[1:07:59] you. Praise the Lord and you build a
[1:08:03] confidence in his word to know that the
[1:08:07] same, the same God who helped you over
[1:08:10] the
[1:08:11] other is the same that shall help you
[1:08:14] over this
[1:08:15] one. And they overcame him.
[1:08:19] by the blood of the
[1:08:21] lamb, by the power of their
[1:08:26] testimony. Every small thing that God
[1:08:28] does in our
[1:08:31] lives is a
[1:08:33] testimony, help us overcome the
[1:08:36] challenges of
[1:08:41] tomorrow. And the prophet says, "The
[1:08:43] Jordan was three or four times in size.
[1:08:53] looking. But Joshua said,
[1:08:56] God said within three
[1:08:59] days, he was very
[1:09:03] confident. God said in his
[1:09:06] word, within three
[1:09:08] days, we are going
[1:09:11] over and we are going
[1:09:15] over. He referenced the
[1:09:19] word. Praise the Lord. God said to me,
[1:09:23] "In 3 days, we shall go over." And then
[1:09:28] he convinced
[1:09:29] himself. I said, "If God
[1:09:33] said in three days, we shall go
[1:09:37] over. Yes, we are going to go
[1:09:40] over." If God
[1:09:42] said that you shall
[1:09:45] overcome, he never said that today
[1:09:48] you'll
[1:09:49] overcome but tomorrow you will
[1:09:52] not. Say one
[1:09:54] word and you shall
[1:09:57] overcome. Surely you shall
[1:10:01] overcome. That is the assurance that we
[1:10:03] can
[1:10:04] have that builds our faith in the
[1:10:07] finished work of
[1:10:09] Calvary to know that there is
[1:10:12] one who has gone before
[1:10:15] us who has fought for
[1:10:18] us who overcame for us and now he brings
[1:10:22] us a finished
[1:10:24] work. So when we take up this
[1:10:27] work and believe this finished
[1:10:30] work, there is no
[1:10:32] mountain that shall stand before us.
[1:10:37] Praise the Lord. Jesus was
[1:10:39] tempted and he
[1:10:41] overcame in Matthew chapter 4. We read
[1:10:45] about
[1:10:46] him. The devil came and tempted him two
[1:10:52] times. And each time he
[1:10:54] came, Jesus knew who he
[1:10:57] was. But he never told him, "I am a
[1:11:01] believer of the
[1:11:02] gospel. I'm a believer of the message.
[1:11:05] Don't you know that I'm a
[1:11:08] believer?" Because Satan knew that Jesus
[1:11:10] was a son of
[1:11:13] God. There was no
[1:11:15] point for Jesus to speak about
[1:11:19] himself. But he knew only one thing.
[1:11:22] that the devil can never
[1:11:25] challenge and that is the
[1:11:28] word. So how did Jesus overcome
[1:11:31] him? Overame Satan by the
[1:11:35] word. He referred to him to the
[1:11:38] word because it is the unfailing word of
[1:11:43] God. And when Satan saw
[1:11:47] that Jesus referred to the word,
[1:11:50] he was
[1:11:52] defeated and then he left
[1:11:54] him. And in verse
[1:11:57] 11 of Matthew chapter
[1:12:02] 4, never left
[1:12:05] him. Why? Because Jesus knew his
[1:12:10] position. He knew his position in a
[1:12:12] word.
[1:12:14] He was the
[1:12:16] word. I never told Satan. I don't tell
[1:12:19] that I am the
[1:12:21] word. No, but he referred to him to the
[1:12:25] word because the word of God stands
[1:12:31] forever. This is what Joshua said.
[1:12:35] said to me, "In three days, we shall
[1:12:39] have to cross
[1:12:40] over. And whether you speak
[1:12:43] what the river is
[1:12:47] raging, he's saying to
[1:12:50] me, I will cross
[1:12:53] over regardless of the of the
[1:12:57] rage, he shall set a standard for
[1:13:01] me. I will cross
[1:13:03] over. You will
[1:13:05] overcome the temptation.
[1:13:08] You will
[1:13:09] overcome sin. You will
[1:13:12] overcome
[1:13:14] sickness. Why? Because he said you'll
[1:13:17] overcome.
[1:13:20] Not because you are so
[1:13:22] strong, not because you're a good
[1:13:25] believer, not because you have a good
[1:13:28] character, not because of a good
[1:13:32] ster, but because he said
[1:13:36] so, you will overcome.
[1:13:39] only be
[1:13:41] strong and be thou
[1:13:43] courageous and keep the
[1:13:46] word and turn away not from
[1:13:50] it. You shall see your
[1:13:53] success. That's right. Jesus let the
[1:13:56] word fight for the de fight the
[1:14:00] devil. He never explained this and the
[1:14:03] other and in the like
[1:14:06] manner. We are public so
[1:14:10] often by the
[1:14:14] trials,
[1:14:15] persecutions and failures in
[1:14:19] life. But we should never give
[1:14:22] up. For we have the one who overcame all
[1:14:26] these trials and failures for us.
[1:14:34] 2 Corinthians
[1:14:37] 4:8. We are trled on every
[1:14:40] side. We are trled on every
[1:14:45] sight. Yet not
[1:14:49] distressed. Sorry. The troubles will
[1:14:52] come. We can't stop them from
[1:14:56] coming. But Paul says, "Yet not
[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:07] distressed. We are
[1:15:09] perplexed but not in
[1:15:13] despair,
[1:15:15] persecuted, but not
[1:15:18] forsaken. Sometimes we are cast
[1:15:22] down but yet not destroyed.
[1:15:29] always bearing about in the
[1:15:35] body, the dying of the Lord
[1:15:38] Jesus, that the life also of
[1:15:42] Jesus might be made manifest in our
[1:15:47] body. For we which
[1:15:50] live are already delivered unto death
[1:15:53] for Jesus's sake.
[1:15:58] But the life also of
[1:16:01] Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal
[1:16:09] flesh. So then death workketh in
[1:16:14] us but life in
[1:16:18] you. Praise the Lord. That's why he says
[1:16:21] you are troubled on every sight.
[1:16:25] that you are not
[1:16:27] distressed. You are
[1:16:29] persecuted but not
[1:16:32] forsaken. And says we having the same
[1:16:35] spirit of
[1:16:39] faith according as it is
[1:16:42] written. I
[1:16:51] believed and
[1:16:53] therefore have I
[1:16:55] spoken. We also
[1:16:59] believe and therefore
[1:17:02] speak. We believe that we have overcome
[1:17:06] the
[1:17:07] world. And we
[1:17:09] believe that he that is in
[1:17:12] us is greater than the troubles that
[1:17:16] come our
[1:17:18] way. And if we
[1:17:20] believe, so do we
[1:17:23] speak. And if we
[1:17:25] speak, so do we possess
[1:17:28] it. Because it was spoken for us.
[1:17:34] It shall come to
[1:17:35] pass, as it is
[1:17:38] written, knowing that he which raised up
[1:17:40] the Lord
[1:17:45] Jesus shall rise
[1:17:48] up as also by
[1:17:51] Jesus and shall present us with
[1:17:55] you. We
[1:17:57] overcome because he lives in us.
[1:18:00] We overcome because he said it is
[1:18:04] finished. And all
[1:18:07] power was delivered unto
[1:18:09] him. So when he has done
[1:18:13] resurrecting and before he was taken
[1:18:17] up, he told the
[1:18:19] disciples, all
[1:18:21] power is given unto me. All
[1:18:26] authority is given unto unto me. Who?
[1:18:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:18:32] And now if he lives in
[1:18:35] us, all that
[1:18:38] power lives in
[1:18:40] us. All that
[1:18:43] authority lives in us.
[1:18:46] Speak to the
[1:18:48] situation with authority.
[1:18:51] speak to sin with authority because all
[1:18:56] the
[1:18:57] authority that Jesus had dwells in us
[1:19:02] because he lives in us. Praise the Lord
[1:19:06] and he overcomes the
[1:19:07] world. He overcomes the
[1:19:10] world and he lives in
[1:19:13] us. Praise the Lord. So even when Satan
[1:19:17] comes so many times, even when Satan
[1:19:20] comes so many
[1:19:22] times to
[1:19:24] persecute, to cause
[1:19:26] distress, to cause
[1:19:29] worry, to cause
[1:19:32] failures, we have the
[1:19:34] assurance that he that lives in
[1:19:37] us is greater and he will always help
[1:19:42] us to overcome. We are a great people.
[1:19:47] We are so great.
[1:19:51] And that's what the Bible talks about
[1:19:53] us that all the great men you talk about
[1:19:56] in the
[1:19:58] Bible talk about
[1:20:00] Moses, God came down and spoke to
[1:20:03] him. But yet
[1:20:06] Moses without
[1:20:09] us, he shall not be perfected.
[1:20:12] Talk about
[1:20:14] Abraham
[1:20:16] Melisedc came and met him and spoke with
[1:20:19] him in the
[1:20:24] tent. He cannot be
[1:20:27] perfected. Talk about
[1:20:29] Noah. Praise the Lord. Talk about Jacob.
[1:20:33] man who wrestled and overcame
[1:20:37] God would not be
[1:20:40] perfected without us. So now we have
[1:20:44] such a great
[1:20:46] treasure that by all
[1:20:49] means we shall have to
[1:20:53] overcome. There is no another
[1:20:57] route for us to
[1:21:00] fail. He's called us by his word.
[1:21:04] And he called us to his
[1:21:06] word. And he has called us to
[1:21:10] perfection by
[1:21:12] us. Those gallant
[1:21:17] soldiers, the great prophets of
[1:21:20] old. Talk about Joshua
[1:21:23] himself. Talk about
[1:21:25] Adam. Talk about Elijah.
[1:21:29] Elisha.
[1:21:30] Ezekiel.
[1:21:32] Daniel, David, Nehemiah, Daniel, all
[1:21:36] those great men of
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:39] old. The Bible says
[1:21:42] in
[1:21:44] Hebrews without
[1:21:47] us, they cannot be
[1:21:50] perfected. So that gives us the
[1:21:53] assurance that we have to
[1:21:57] overcome. Surely we shall overcome.
[1:22:01] because it is a
[1:22:03] promise. He is in
[1:22:05] us. And then what shall we say about the
[1:22:09] things if he dwells in us and if that
[1:22:13] God who dwells in
[1:22:15] us is for
[1:22:18] us who can be against
[1:22:21] us. It is he that spared not his own
[1:22:26] son but delivered him up for us.
[1:22:31] How shall he not with
[1:22:35] him also freely give us all
[1:22:39] things? Who shall lay
[1:22:43] anything
[1:22:46] judge of God is
[1:22:49] elect? It is God that
[1:22:52] justifies. Who is he that
[1:22:56] condemns? It is Christ that died.
[1:23:00] Yeah. Rather that is risen
[1:23:03] again who is even at the right hand of
[1:23:07] God. Who shall then separate
[1:23:12] us if he has come
[1:23:15] down like he said I have overcome the
[1:23:19] world and because I have overcome the
[1:23:22] world you also
[1:23:25] overcome. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:28] If he left the
[1:23:32] heavens, hung up on the
[1:23:35] cross and he was made shame for
[1:23:39] us. So every
[1:23:41] trouble, every
[1:23:44] sin, every
[1:23:46] weakness, every
[1:23:48] failure was cast upon him upon the
[1:23:52] cross. Now he bore all the shame
[1:23:57] And every
[1:23:59] pain, sickness that there is in the
[1:24:03] world was pushed upon him upon the
[1:24:09] cross. Even death
[1:24:13] himself, was cast upon him upon the
[1:24:18] cross when he breathed his
[1:24:23] last. First of all, he couldn't breathe
[1:24:27] his
[1:24:28] last until it was all
[1:24:32] finished. Until you are done overcoming
[1:24:34] all your
[1:24:36] troubles, until every weakness in your
[1:24:42] body, dealt with. He couldn't breathe
[1:24:46] his
[1:24:47] lust. Then when it was all cast upon
[1:24:52] him until it was too
[1:24:57] dirty, our sins, our failures, our
[1:25:00] sickness, our pains, our sorrows, all of
[1:25:04] them after they were all cast upon
[1:25:08] him, it became so
[1:25:11] dirty, his shame was too
[1:25:15] dirty for nature to behold.
[1:25:19] old. Praise the Lord. And that's why at
[1:25:22] that
[1:25:24] time when it was all
[1:25:27] gathered and cast upon
[1:25:30] him, the the
[1:25:33] sun took took down its light. The stars
[1:25:38] took down their light because they could
[1:25:41] not afford looking at the
[1:25:45] shame that you and I were to
[1:25:48] bear. But thank God that he took it
[1:25:53] all. And upon the
[1:25:55] cross he then breathe it is
[1:25:59] finished. It is finished. All your
[1:26:02] troubles are
[1:26:03] finished. All your shame are finished.
[1:26:06] So now you know where to stand
[1:26:10] right. You stand right at the finished
[1:26:13] work of
[1:26:15] Calvary and every bit of
[1:26:19] it. Not because of your
[1:26:21] power but because it was finished at
[1:26:27] Calvary. That's why he
[1:26:29] says when uh when when Paul was taken up
[1:26:33] in the
[1:26:34] spirit and we looked at the glories of
[1:26:38] God, we looked at the elect of
[1:26:41] God, how precious she
[1:26:44] is. Then who shall separate
[1:26:48] us? That love of God that is with
[1:26:50] Christ.
[1:26:54] Tribulation, shall
[1:26:56] distress, shall
[1:26:58] persecution, shall famine, shall
[1:27:02] nakedness, bur or
[1:27:05] swat, as it is
[1:27:07] written, for thy sake, we are killed all
[1:27:11] day
[1:27:12] long. And then he
[1:27:14] says, nay, in all these things,
[1:27:19] we are more than conquerors.
[1:27:23] not on our
[1:27:25] own through
[1:27:27] him that loved us.
[1:27:31] Praise the Lord. Nothing shall separate
[1:27:33] us from that
[1:27:34] love. He did upon the cross. Then it was
[1:27:38] not
[1:27:40] over. He took out, he drained out all
[1:27:42] his
[1:27:44] blood and then he brought it and put it
[1:27:48] upon the altar
[1:27:50] and says, "I know
[1:27:52] In the world, you shall face
[1:27:57] persecution. You'll be
[1:27:59] persecuted. You'll be
[1:28:01] condemned. I have placed the blood upon
[1:28:04] the
[1:28:05] altar. And each time you get
[1:28:09] stained, come back upon the
[1:28:12] altar, wash and get
[1:28:15] clean, and come back
[1:28:18] again. So he provided for all.
[1:28:22] What shall we then
[1:28:23] say? If he loved us, what shall we then
[1:28:27] say that can separate
[1:28:29] us? The love of
[1:28:32] God in Christ
[1:28:34] Jesus. Praise the Lord. He saw so many
[1:28:38] people that went through
[1:28:41] distress and yet they
[1:28:43] overcame. And we
[1:28:45] overcome because he overcame.
[1:28:48] He overcome because at the cross he
[1:28:52] overcame. Then on the day of
[1:28:55] Pentecost once again
[1:28:58] condescended he came and dwelt in us.
[1:29:02] So that great God,
[1:29:04] the creator of the universe,
[1:29:07] the great I
[1:29:09] am, the Alpha and the Omega, omega, the
[1:29:13] one who took his blood upon the

[1:46:27] you are the truth. You are the life.
