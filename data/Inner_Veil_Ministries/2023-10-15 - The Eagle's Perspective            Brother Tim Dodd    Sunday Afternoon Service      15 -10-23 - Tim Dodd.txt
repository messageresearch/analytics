Revelation greetings to you all in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ for those of you that were not here this morning we greet you from the Saints in Canada and the Saints in Ethiopia where we were just before we came to Uganda amen amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we are thankful that you keep your word you are here in the midst of us we pray that you'll help us to rise above the flesh that is to say get out of the way that your spirit might move in power and in demonstration take these vessels we offer them unto you a Living Sacrifice may you use us For Your Glory anoint the word anoint the speaker anoint The Interpreter and anoint the hearer we pray father you are the word that discerns every heart you know exactly what needs to be spoken we humble oursel before you speak thy word oh Lord that your children will be blessed in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen Revelation chapter 4 we'll refresh our minds with this scripture verse six and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like un Crystal and in the the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion the second beast like a calf the third Beast had the face of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying let's just turn over to chapter five and verse eight and when he the lamb had taken the book the four and four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation now let's turn to the next chapter chapter 6 verse and when he had opened the fourth seal that's the lamb opening the seal when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice not of the lamb but of the fourth Beast the eagle say come and see and I looked beh and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the Earth amen the Lord add his Blessing to the word you may have your seats now we dealt this morning with the four anointings coming in their season but we have come to the end time how many believe we're in the end time it's not the events of the age that ushered in the end time it's not not the world governments that ushered in the end time it's not the United Nations that ansers in the world the end time there is one thing it is the opening of the seals that ushers in the end time so there is a people on the Earth who have caught the Revelation that the lamb has opened the seals and they know it is the end time the rest of the world doesn't know what time it is but we know what time it is amen we have received God's Vindicated Prophet we're not living under the lion anointing we're not living under the the ox anointing we're not living under the man anointing the opening of the seals or loose the eagle anointing into the church to bring forth the events of the end time we have been anointed every believer since the Acts chapter 2 has been anointed and we cannot but respond to the anointings that is sent into the church the church can only do what the anointing makes them do amen put up the slides for me if you you would all right and I want to just go quickly through some quotes of brother brandham is that okay amen a few of you will enjoy it the rest of you can enjoy can watch I want to speak tonight on the Eagles perspective so now here we are what we read this morning the Martyrs down Through the Ages suffered terribly but what were they they were under the inspiration the spirit of God the power you notice the last sentence How could a man do anything else besides the power of God that had been released to them Jesus said in Acts chapter one you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you that's all they knew they didn't know it would be a lion anointing they didn't know it would be a ox anointing they didn't know a man anointed would come after that and they didn't know it would be the eagle anointing in your day but God has finished the mystery the power that was sent in every age corresponds to the anointing around the [Music] throne and he says if God sends a certain Spirit amongst them that's the only thing that's the only thing I'll say it again that's the only thing they can work by is the spirit that works among them it's not what you want to do it's not your idea it's not my idea God has a purpose and he sends an anointing upon the church and we have come in these last days to the last anointing has to get the church ready for a Rapture the lion anointing did not get the church ready for a Rapture the ox anointing was not for the Rapture the man anointing was not for the Rapture those prepared people for a resurrection but this anointing that has come in this hour is to prepare you for a body chain amen it had to be a different anointing because this is the hour of the fullness of adoption the hour of the the Redemption of our mortal bodies isn't it what our bodies were not redeemed in any other Age come on our bodies are redeemed in this age the fullness of adoption the change of these bodies the C Gene within you says I cannot manifest myself I am constrained by this [Music] body but one day at the last Trump in a moment in the twinkling of an eye this Mortal will put on immortality hallelujah hallelujah the seed Gene within us will say now I can do what I have always believed hallelujah hallelujah glory to God this is the hour give the next one now will prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose let me just read that again if we're going to prove by the opening of the seals that means the seals are open amen watch exactly the church responds to the anointing it couldn't do nothing else Easter seal Jesus so full of quickening power said if you can destroy this Temple that you took 40 years you thought to build I'll raise it up in three days why did Jesus say that he knew what the true temple of God was it wasn't the building they were looking at it was the Temple of his body in him dwell the fullness of God he knew what the word said he was and he had perfect faith in that word amen give me the next one do you know that you're the one the Bible speaks of hello hello do you know your position in Christ if you're in Christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like every day living to you it's yours you're an eagle that's your food man shall not live by bread alone man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Jesus knew who he was the bride knows who she is I'm going to take you to the message perfect Faith now the disciples had had been given power and to heal the sick cast out devils and a man brought his [Music] son and they couldn't heal him and Jesus came and said why trouble you these men he said I brought my son and they couldn't heal him and and Sir can you help me Jesus said I can if you believe amen are you ready for this one he says Lord I believe help thou my unbelief now what he saying is Lord I believe [Music] he's saying I believe but I have a lack of faith you see that's the problem with the church as you see just a moment do Jesus gave the disciples the power but the problem wasn't the power the problem was their lack of faith this man was a Jew he saw them pray for other people other people were healed he brought his son to them heal my son but nothing happened and and they turned to Jesus Jesus said if you believe all things are possible he says I Lord I I'm believing with all the faith I have see the problem is I don't have enough Faith you see faith is not believing Here We Go Again believing is the action you take with your faith which is a substance [Music] you see you can't you can believe but if you don't have faith belie do anything all right I need to set an example here I was thinking about this I believe if I touch this pulpit if I touch this Pulpit that my body will be made Immortal see you can believe anything you want that doesn't make it happen all right why there's no faith or revelation behind that believing see there's no promise in the word that says touch the pulpit and you'll be changed because faith comes by hearing the word I can get emotional I could scream I could fast I could lay my hands I could stay here day and night nothing's going to happen because there's no promise our faith is established in the promises when it's revealed to you the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against [Music] it so touching the pulpit won't change my body by receiving the end time message being Anointed with the end time anointing has a promise that this body shall be changed Hallelujah huj Lord I believe by faith in the revealed word of God it must come to pass the gates of hell cannot Prevail against it it's thus saith the Lord God keeps his word hallelujah hallelujah all right now let's get into it now remember they had the power Jesus had given them the power to heal the sick to raise the dead to cast out Devils just a few few days before that they had the power but not the faith to use the [Music] power think about it they had the power they had the power they had the power but the power without faith is [Applause] useless next one now there's brandom Tabernacle there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power the power that's going to produce the resurrection is here the power that's going to change your body is here it's anointing you you got if you got the Holy Spirit if you have the Holy Spirit you have enough power in you to speak worlds into existence and go and live on them but it's governed by a law not a law of dos and don'ts it's a law of Faith or Revelation as much as the Lord will reveal to you that's how much power you can move now the Holy Spirit brother bandam says is here with the power but you haven't got the faith to move it resurrection power is here body change power is here all the power of the word is here but it takes faith to move it when the seals were opened catch oh Lord open our eyes when the seals were open the power the anointing the eagle of the last days was loosed upon the church it's here now but it can only be moved by revelation now he said Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he [Music] was it's written of me didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that I am see the Jews came to Jesus and said our fathers did eat man in the wilderness shadows and types Jesus said I am that bread that came down from [Music] Heaven your fathers did eat mana and are dead but whoever eats my flesh and drink my blood shall never [Music] perish he says this is the bread that your father gives he looked at Abraham Abraham rejoiced to see my and before Abraham was I am hallelujah hallelujah he knew what the word said he was he took his place in the word that's why he could say destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up because the word said I'll not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption I'll not leave his soul in Hell hallelujah hallelujah he knew the promise listen do you know your promise the Lord shall descend with a shout amen do we have the shout not shouting out the shout is a message to gather his people together in the revealing of Jesus Christ for their amen amen remember Jesus had faith in the word yes I know go ahead he knew that with that a perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I myself do nothing but it's my faith in [Music] God and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word comes in you hallelujah hallelujah it's made manifest for you are a Believer and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in [Music] you that's what you are you are the the believer is the Revelation that has been loose to him not the emotion not the memory being able to memorize the message being able to memorize the scriptures it's not about that it's what is revealed to you you are what is revealed to you you are what is revealed to you there's a that God is revealing to show you who you are hallelujah hallelujah we need to digest this because the revelation of the CG is the revelation of the power within [Music] you and the revelation of the power loses the power to you you'll see this as we go forward all right we better keep going here but Jesus lived in a world that no one knowed [Music] about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in a perfect God in which he was you do you believe that how many believe that Jesus lived in a world that nobody knowed about he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was he wasn't trying to be as I said this morning the Bible is not who you want to be the Bible is who you are and God is just taking away your unbelief line upon line taking away your man-made ideas taking away Creeds and dogmas because it's Creeds and dogmas that bind the power of the Holy Spirit and little by little well listen God has sent a supernatural message the word by the mouth of a prophet not something new but this Bible revealed we're standing with the Bible that's been revealed that's the power of the Life In You by the new birth can be loosed upon the Earth and produce a resurrection and produce a body change and produce a perfect overcoming this is who Jesus wasc if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are we would be a Mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you'd not do amen so what you do and what you don't do is based on the spirit leading [Music] you therefore there is therefore now no condemnation who walk after to those who walk after the spirit and not after the flesh [Music] oh come on this flesh tells me this flesh tells me I'm 60 years old but that's not going to hinder me because Beyond this flesh is an eternal seed dream this flesh tells me I am the son of Gerald and Dorothy do but my C Gene tells me I'm the Son of [Applause] God now you can choose to walk after the [Music] flesh or you can walk after the spirit there is no condemn Nation to them that walk after the spirit you see brother brandham was led of the spirit to go and preach to the Pentecostal but his mother-in-law his wife influenced him not to follow the leading of the spirit it cost his wife it cost child why because it brought condemnation he was in the wrong place but he was still a Son of God and God corrected his servant and sent him out so we could have this message hallelujah hallelujah see if you l no we're not done yet you and you'd be a Mystic person to them the world won't understand you why because the thing the mind of man cannot comprehend the mind of God the things of God are spiritually [Music] discerned hallelujah hallelujah go ahead next one that's the way it is to all [Music] believers they're ICS the the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves I don't come to Uganda and say you know what I have to understand this man that is a Ugandan he's poor are you going to inter for me he lives he lives in a poor country he lives in a poor house he doesn't have any money you can't understand a Son of God by the flesh no this is my brother this is a Son of God these are sons of God these are Daughters of God these are the elect of the earth it's got nothing to do with money it's got nothing to do with the flesh it's got nothing to do with the color of your skin God has chosen you to receive the greatest message that this world has ever received hallelujah hallelujah we cannot understand each other by the flesh I'm not Canadian I'm not Canadian I'm a brother to Jesus Christ I'm a joined Heir I have a right to the promises this is not brother bram's message this is not Joseph brandham message listen we can't understand one another by the flesh Joseph brandham Billy Paul brandham Rebecca brandham Sarah brandham thank you they would all say this is my daddy's message that's the flesh I say this is my daddy's [Applause] message hallelujah hallelujah this message is not after the flesh we only know each other by the [Music] spirit that's that's why Paul even said we hereby know know not one another by the flesh he went further and said henceforth we don't don't even know Jesus Christ by the flesh why because all believers are Mystics to the world they walk in faith of what the word says they are hallelujah [Music] hallelujah and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance faith isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ it doesn't matter what they're doing there it doesn't matter what they're doing there God has revealed to me personally that's why there's nobody that can stand behind the pulpit and say if you don't believe this message for this Revelation you're not going to make it no man can tell you what to believe and not to believe because no man can give Revelation but we preach the full counsel of God that God might reveal himself to you personally that you might walk by faith substance Faith isolates you from the world a new creature in Christ then brother ryom says now you're getting into bride material now you're getting into rapturing condition because that's what the eagle anointing was sent for to cause you to see who you are that you might walk by faith in what the word says you are there's a people that won't die Paul said it we shall not all sleep we shall not all sleep they slept in the first age they went into the ground in the second age the third the fourth theth sixth age on down to this age but we shall not all sleep there is a people that won't know the grave they will be changed I believe the Bible is speaking [Music] about do you believe he's speaking about you the eagle anointing is sent to give you a perfect fa in what the word says you are that's rapturing condition that means for each one of us not just the pastor deacons trustees that means for the Ley every individual every individual walks in a world with God Alone you're baptized into the kingdom there's nobody in there but you and God that's why somebody walks away from the truth means nothing to me I wasn't called because of him I wasn't called because of her I'm walking with God [Music] Alone he has revealed it to me he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt nowhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same amen now listen folks Len you might not feel you're you're there yet you might not feel like you have arrived there but you are there and you just don't realize it but because that's the bride for this age it's not your works it's not your understanding it's God doing the work in in you the Bible speaks about the bride in these last days husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her that he might present unto him a bride without spot without wrinkles without blemish or any such thing washed in the water of the word washed in the water of the word washed from what wash from unbelief wash from doubt wash from Fear wash from everything contrary to the word of God because when everything is washed away there stands a spotless bride hallelujah hallelujah there stands a perfect people with perfect faith in the word of God hallelujah hallelujah whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt nowhere you just walk right on if you got a shadow of a doubt step into the sun in the sun there's no Shadows let the revealing of the son of God shine upon your life till there's not a shadow of a doubt nowhere [Music] amen next one now you're coming into perfect Faith this is you he's talking about perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails that's you a prophet was speaking about you somebody say Amen the prophet was speaking about you the prophet was speaking about you I'm not asking you if you feel it I'm asking you if you believe [Music] it the angel of the Lord told brother brandham if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand at your prayers not even cancer he never said if you can get the people to feel it [Music] he never said if you can get the people to repent he never said if you can get the people to shout he never said if you can get the people to dance he said if you can get the people to believe you now the prophet said Do you believe what the prophet said you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot [Music] fail somebody say Amen somebody say that's me I'm not going by feelings I'm not going by understanding I'm walking by Perfect faith in what the word says [Music] that faith never fails listen I can tell you some testimonies God responds to Faith there was a boy in our church he played ice hockey ice hockey you know what ice hockey is [Music] and he took a shot right in the chest they play Ice Hockey with a frozen piece of rubber rubber rubber do you know what rubber is like a tire all right and they can shoot it at 100 miles an [Music] hour [Music] and it hit him in the chest and he was having troubles and he would it would cause him pain the doctor didn't know what it was wasn't a broken bone but something went wrong and they came into the church wasn't a service but it was between services and they said brother Tim could you pray for him so I took him in the sanctuary and I took the anointing oil and I I anointed him with oil and I prayed the prayer of faith now listen this is his testimony he said as brother Tim prayed the pain got worse got worse not better worse he says and until and then brother Tim finished praying now listen when I finished praying I thought Lord I didn't feel a thing I didn't feel anything but Lord I know your word is true we have obeyed your word and before that boy left the sanctuary the pain complet completely left and he's been painfree ever since perfect faith in a perfect word has nothing to do with your feelings there was another boy he had hurt his shoulder do you know what dislocated shoulder means many times he had dislocated his shoulder he needed surgery and he he was believing for his shoulder and his testimony was brother Tim in the service when you were preaching I don't know what happened but I was thinking Lord I would sure love to raise my hands and worship you he says you said said something and when you said that he says something like an electric went into my shoulder hallelujah hallelujah says I didn't know what it was but all I know from that time forward I could raise my [Music] arms hallelujah hallelujah we have a high praise we have a Healer we have a God that keeps his word amen now he has anointed the church in these last days to come to perfect faith and he's talking about everybody not the special preacher not the visiting Minister not the pastor everybody this is for everybody and so the Eagle anointing has come on the church and he's sent to combat the death power that's moving against this [Music] age all right now now listen what is an eagle you know what an eagle is an eagle has long range Vision an eagle has two wings that it can fly higher than any other bird an eagle can separate itself from the world if you knew where the all the eagle does he sets his wings on the [Music] wind I don't know if you understand where wind comes from but the wind comes from the sun he feing the earth and the greatest upcurrent for the Eagles is when the sun strikes exposed [Music] rock that raises the eagle higher and [Music] higher what is The Rock is the revelation of the word of God when the Sun Shines on the word it causes the Eagles to rise higher and higher the eagle has confidence in the wings that God gave it that it can fly away from its enemy one time brother Brandon was was in a storm in the mountains and as he's thinking as the sun broke through the clouds after the storm he's admiring the beauty of it and he starts worshiping God and there's a squirrel squirrel and the squirrel is going chatter chatter chatter you know that's that's what a squirrel does he's making noise and brother brandham thought the squirrel was making noise because he was worshiping God but he looked at the squirrel he says it's not upset about me he saw that there was an eagle that was standing near a tree that had been blown down in the storm now listen the eagle did not think I've been blown down in the storm I guess I just have to walk on the earth the rest of my days I've been in a storm and here I am on the earth and now I just have to walk on the earth like a lion like an ox like a man I'll just walk on the earth no that's not the way the eagle was made when the storm was over brother Ram say he just started to flex his wings he'd been given a different anointing he was not an Earthbound creature and so he be to flex his wings and when he got tired of the chatter chatter chatter of the world squirrel he just took a couple of flops set his wings on the Winds of faith and Rose up out of there Hallelujah hallu listen Eagle you might have been blown down in a storm you don't have to stay down this is not the lion age is not the man age this is not the ox age this is the eagle a hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah see God made the eagle and he Likens the eagle to himself he calls himself an eagle he calls His prophets Eagles and he says you are now under an eagle anointing the first three anointings were all Earthbound but this anointing has a higher perspective you are called to rise into a different perspective you will see what the lion saw I will restore sayith the Lord you'll see what the ox saw you'll see what the man saw but you'll rise above farther than naked [Music] rise you're not limited to what they can see you see you have been anointed the power has been sent into the church to give us the perspective that prophets of old [Music] had see what did prophets of old have when they came to worship there was Aaron Moses was up on the mountain and Aaron was down with the people and the people said Moses can't live this long on the mountain Aaron make us something to worship from a human perspective they worship the golden calf but while on the mountain Moses was seeing into Heavenly things and he was going to establish the people in Heavenly [Music] worship he was sent to bring true worship to the people all right let's look at some of these prophetic examples for [Music] us these prophets were Anointed with an eagle anointing listen the eagle flies in the heavenlies so that it can see the way God sees it that's what this is about God wants you to see yourself the way God sees you not the way man sees you not the way you see yourself but be anointed into the mind of Christ to see who you are in his thoughts because he wrote your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that's not a book that you turn pages let me see if I can find your name here uh just wait just wait let me see if you're here that's not it no the Lamb's Book of Life is the thoughts of God when God was alone that's why in John 1 when the logos comes into view the very thought and expression of God brother ROM says that's when the Lamb's Book of Life comes into view it's the beginning of creation it's the beginning of the expression of Jehovah and your name is written there I don't care what the Catholic Church thinks about me I don't care what the Baptist Church thinks about I don't care what the Pentecostal Church thinks I don't even care what this this church thinks I care what God thinks about me I want to know what he thinks about me you've been anointed to rise up into the thoughts of God Elijah Elijah there on Mount Carmel he's a commissioned by God to call people to repent rep call Israel to repentance says if ba be God serve him if the Lord be God serve him he says but let the God who is God answer by fire now Elijah meets 400 prophets of Baal up on the mountain is that right he says now you go ahead call on your God if your God is God let him answer by [Music] fire uhhuh so Elijah sits back says go ahead if your God is God they start calling on their God he says hey call a little louder maybe your God's tired maybe he's busy maybe he needs a hearing aid call a little louder he sat there and watched them what were the prophets of Bale doing they were screaming they were shouting they were dancing they were cutting themselves they were doing everything they knew how to do to try and bring the presence of God but Elijah was anointed what is anointing it's not emotions it's supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how Hallelujah and so there he was the evening time says it's time for me to put the altar or put the altar in order and he took 12 Stones the altar of Israel one for Judah one for Ephraim one for Dan what was he doing was taking the altar that was broken down and putting it back in order let me put it another way let me put it another way he was in the loose ends together that was his ministry he rebuilds the altar then he puts the sacrifice on the altar then he says bring water and they dug a trench around the now it had been a drought for three and a half years there had been no rain there was not a drop of moisture in that ground they kept pouring water on the sacrifice so much water that it filled up the ditch but before it filled up the ditch the ground had to become wet and more water and more water until finally the ditch filled up why because God had told him to do it this way now here's Elijah by Perfect faith in what the word said to do he said Lord let it be known that you are God and that I am your Prophet hallelujah hallelujah Elijah Anointed with an eagle anointing knew who he [Music] was and the fire came out of heaven and struck the altar consumed the sacrifice consumed the water and even consumed the stone there was nothing but a bird spot left on the ground why CU Elijah knew who he [Applause] was now praise the Lord he gets a message we'll call it a text message he gets a text message from Jezebel you killed my prophets I'm going to kill you tomorrow by this time you'll be dead here's the mighty prophet of God knows who he is and he says God you didn't tell me this part and he runs he's scared why cuz that part was not revealed to him he's still human but he had no Revelation so he run into the Wilderness run away from Jezebel run to the cave he thought my life is over it's all finished and he's at the cave but he's still a prophet he still knows God he still knows who he is he might not feel anything but he's there waiting for God and an earthquake goes by and God is not in the earthquake and A Mighty Wind goes through he says no God's Not In The Wind cuz he's anointed and then a fire exactly fire he had just called fire from heaven now fire goes through he goes no God's not in the fire he knows his God hallelujah he knows his God he he knows what it is to be God's prophet Bible says a still Small Voice and Elijah wraps himself in his mantle and he goes to the cave and God speaks to him says what doest thou here Elijah he says you want me to read the scripture I'm just telling the story take that down I'm not going to read it word for word you go home and read your Bible but he says I have been jealous for the Lord my God they have slain all the prophets now I'm only one left and they threatened to take my life there's nobody in Israel except me who not b b and what does God do I brother Bram said it this way he pulled back the seals a little bit he showed him there were still 7,000 that had not Hallelujah there was still a work to do Elijah it's not over yet we're Anointed with an eagle anointing to look for every last predestinated seed because we know who we are there's still another one that needs to know who they are amen God knows what he's doing let's look at another Prophet oh I love this story Elisha at Dar now Elijah had been telling King Ahab I think it was Ahab nevertheless he was telling the king of is Isel and saying don't go on this road because the syrians have an ambush and then a little while later he'd send another message to the king don't go over this way because the syrians are laying in wait for you and the king of Syria says what's going on there's a spy in our midst he says he says let's find out who the Spy is that's telling the king of Israel what we're doing and one of his servants says oh no King there's no spy Israel has a prophet and the prophet warns the king now listen the reason Israel is in the trouble it's in today is because they don't listen to their prophets there's a war going on over there there's a war and it's it was surprised to them when they were attacked because there was no Prophet to tell them what was going on but back in those days the King was listening to elishah so the the Syrian Army said the Syrian King says let's go get him and in the still of night they quietly surround the city of dotham and gesi gets up in the morning oh it's time to make coffee and he looks out the window hey help we're surrounded Elisha Elisha they we this city is surrounded we're in trouble we're going to die it's so [Music] terrible and Elijah says oh don't worry says there's more with us than there is with them now just a minute here gesi was trying to believe okay I'll take your word for it Elisha but I can just imagine he's trembling still fearful still doubting he says how can that be there's more I can't see anybody and then Elisha says Lord open his eyes or in other words let him see what I see or in other words anoint him with the anointing that I am anointed with an eagle anointing and so El G's eyes come open and he sees that the hills are filled the Chariots of Fire angels of Fire SWS of fire listen now the fear that GES had was no more the doubts that gesi had were no more now listen listen closely nothing had changed nothing had changed those angels didn't just suddenly arrive they were already there when the a when the armies of Syria [Applause] came the Lord sent his army but gesi didn't see it and he feared but they were still there so what did it take it took his eyes coming open to be raised up to see what Elisha saw hallelujah hallelujah the circumstances never changed it was the Revelation that Chang hallelujah hallelujah when God reveals something to you it is a finished work the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that's why the eagle anointing is s in this hour to raise you above what the lion saw what the man saw what the arc saw if all we know was what was down through the church ages from the book of Acts to the Pentecostal we are fearful and doubtful but let go God let God take this Eagle anointing and anoint his church to see that it's already a finished [Applause] word oh it takes Revelation I was talking about Ruth yesterday how that you know when she went into Boaz and Boaz gave her six measures of barley and she went home and Naomi saw what she had she was carrying this load of barley and she said what what where did you get this barley and she said what did he say he said I'll do the work what did Naomi say see Ruth didn't understand but but she needed a revelation and so Naomi told her girl you can rest because he won't rest until he has finished the work hallelujah hallelujah I can see that he loves you it's God revealing that he always loved you that's what the Lamb's Book of Life is your name was in his thoughts in love because God is love he can't he never there never was a time before he loved you he can never stop loving you and there's never an end to his love for you hallelujah hallelujah you know sometimes when I'm on the mission field I get feeling sorry for myself you know my children used to say Dad you have no sympathy I said that's not true I feel sorry for myself sometimes and sometimes when you're away from home for a long period of time you're missing your wife you're missing your family and you're you're just wishing you're at home I remember one time I was in the country of Ghana at a convention I had been in Tanzania and then I went over to Ghana and it was I think the last or second last day of the convention I was trying to study trying to pray and I got to praying Lord I'm sorry I miss my wife so much Lord I'm sorry I wish I was at home Lord I'm so sorry I'd been gone for three weeks I'm just waiting to get home you know what the Lord said to me he says I've been waiting 6,000 years H hallelujah hallelujah I thought if I can feel that way about my family after three weeks how does he feel about us after 6,000 years Oh How He Loves You Oh How He Loves Me hallelujah hallelujah I have to bring this to a close our time is up you have to go home I want you to just catch this here now remember the the the eagle a the eagle anointing is combating the one that's called Death combating the fighting against the death the one the Antichrist Called Death because death is in the land we've come to seed time when a plant comes to seed time the seed that went into the ground has come up through the different stages but when it comes to the seed the Harvest Time every part of the plant Must Die the shoot Must Die the stock Must Die the tosel Must Die the shock Must Die it must all die brother random even says about it that's the reason the Pentecostals are dying now because the age is here the word has been manifest the eagle time the time of the word to return back to restore the faith amen that's the time that we're living in now we're we're living in the hour where God has restored all things has brought this word into position has Anointed The Church of the last day it's time to receive it's time to accept it's time to believe it's time to let every fear and doubt Fall by the wayside that the anointing that God has sent upon the church listen I can prove it to you now by history exactly how it acts brother Bram in the seals couldn't use [Music] history to prove the eagle [Music] anointing because it was future but now we've come to the end most of it is history but there's one thing God's waiting for is for you to say Amen to every word of God you see because he hasn't just taken away our punishment he's taken away our guilt whom he forew he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son is that you moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called he justified he justifies if he calls you he justifies You by faith in the blood of Jesus Christ you stand spotless in the presence of God you don't stand forgiven you stand perfect you stand Guiltless oh my don't you understand what I'm talking about you're standing in the presence of God not by anything you did but because of Calvary I stand here without an ounce of guilt and that's why every promise in the word is mine that's why a body changes mind listen the the circumstances haven't changed the blood was shed 2,000 years ago what has changed the revelation of the word the word has become open that you see in the sight of God you bear no guilt if you stand here today and know with without a shadow of a doubt that I am Guiltless there's nothing the devil can do to you it's the devil that's lying to you he's trying to tell you you're nobody he's trying to tell you made too many mistakes he tried to tell the woman at the well you made too many mistakes she was excommunicated by the church the church couldn't do anything for her but the word in her day to her the revelation of the word is this not the very Messiah come see a man she dropped her water and ran into a city a city that had rejected her and said come see a message come see a man that told me all things isn't this the very mess hallelujah hallelujah she went from sad and guilty and depressed and anxious when the word came to her and showed her who she was in the sight of God rise up on the wings of an eagle today rise up into the thoughts of God don't let the devil lie to you you're the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah God has sent his power into the church so you can say I believe every word is spoken of me and I stand by faith I don't care what the circumstances look like I don't care what the situation looks like it doesn't matter to me what my family looks like it doesn't mean matter to me what the what my job situation is it doesn't matter to me how poor I am every promise in this word is mine hallelujah hallelujah then you can leave this service completely free cuz he took your your guilt away you have been Justified moreover whom he has Justified he is already glorified in his eyes you're already sitting by his side for you are the Bride of Jesus he took your guilt away he the word took your guilt away there was woman in the Old Testament what a woman and if her husband was jealous of her accused her of committing [Music] adultery but couldn't prove it if he could prove it she'd be stoned but he's got a jealous Spirit on him he accuses her of being unfaithful no matter how much she protested they could argue there could be Strife in the hall but he she could stand there and say I never did nothing he can say I don't believe you I don't believe you the word of God gave a a remedy for that in Numbers Chapter 5 we won't read read it you read it when you go home there was an oath that was made and the woman would have to agree to the oath and the priest would take the ashes of a sacrifice and he would write the words of the oath and he would take a sponge and he would D dip it in water and dip it on the ashes so now now that the words of the oath are in the water and he would put the water into the the cup now the words of the oath was if she was guilty the ashes would cause her thigh to rot cause her stomach to rot and she would die the words of the curse listen Jesus took your curse away but now listen to this she now had to take that water and drink that water and she say I I forget what the exact words are but you would have to say that she says Amen to the words of the curse now to a woman woman that was guilty that was a terrible thing she's hoping but the Bible's not true she's hoping that she won't die but she's guilty but if a woman is not guilty she can drink that water she can drink it down to the last drop this is good stuff I say Amen to every word of the curse why because she knows she's not guilty of the curse she knows the ashes will have no effect upon [Music] her because now now what was Strife in her home now her innocence could be proven listen Saints Jesus took your guilt away you can now take the book and you can eat the book you can say Amen to every word of God you can say Amen to Every curse you can say Amen to Every Blessing you can say Amen to every promise because Jesus took your guilt away hallelujah hallelujah We Stand spotless in the presence of God say Amen to every word amen there was a scripture that I saw recently out of the book of Jeremiah it says Jeremiah 15 and verse [Music] 16 now this one you can put up on the screen Jeremiah 15 and verse 16 I want you to see this verse thy words were found and I did eat them and Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart Thy Word was found or we could say Thy Word was revealed and I did eat it and this message it's a rejoicing of my heart for I am called by thy name I have seen my name on the L's book of lifeu oh Lord God of hosts I have seen my name I have eaten your book and it causes a rejoicing in my life because I am heir to every promise of God I stand as Guiltless in Jesus Christ can you say Amen can you say Amen to the word can you see who you are Lord help me can you see the circumstances have not changed there's been no additional atonement it's still the atonement of Calvary but what happened in this hour the power of the atonement was loosed by the full word being [Music] revealed hallelujah hallelujah we're standing in the age of the full revelation and God has sent power into the church the power of the eagle to raise you up and cause you to see yourself the way God sees you like the angel that came to Mary and said Mary you are that one that the scripture talks about a virgin shall conceive and Mary said be it unto me according to your word she couldn't make it happen she just believed I am the one the Bible's talking [Music] about Bible said there'd be a bride washed in the water of the word standing spotless in the presence of God so I ask you are you that one if you are that one why don't you stand to your feet I'm not asking how you feel I'm asking what you believe do you believe the word of a prophet do you believe the word that has come to you to anoint you to see who you are Heavenly Father Lord you see the heart of every individual here Lord we stand in your presence we are powerless human beings but inside of these Tabernacles inside of these temples there lays a power a creative power that is only hindered by a lack of faith in our lives Lord I pray you will pour in re ration I pray you'll Quicken your word let your Eagle anointing Quicken your people may they go from here in faith tonight recognizing themselves in your word may they say be it unto me according to your word we commit them into your hands father that your word would be fulfilled in their lives it's not how we feel your
