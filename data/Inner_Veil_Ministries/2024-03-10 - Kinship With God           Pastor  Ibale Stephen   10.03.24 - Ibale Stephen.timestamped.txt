[20:02] promise that by your stripes they were

[20:45] whatsoever we pray in the name of

[20:54] full we committed those Saints into your
[20:57] hands
[20:59] in Jesus name amen so while we are
[21:04] standing I think let's go to scripture
[21:09] reading and you are all welcome to the
[21:12] house of
[21:14] God Amen that's important for us to feed
[21:18] on the word of
[21:20] God Amen without that there's no
[21:25] future amen because the future
[21:29] you know is dropping into
[21:32] eternity so eternity picks us from this
[21:37] side to hand over into the fullness of
[21:42] Eternity amen so the book of Romans
[21:48] 12 and verse
[21:51] 4 amen we are going to read
[21:55] here it says for as we have many members
[22:00] in one body and all members have not the
[22:04] same
[22:11] office so we being many are one body in
[22:16] Christ and everyone members of
[22:26] another
[22:32] let's
[22:33] pray precious Heavenly
[22:36] Father we thank you for these
[22:39] scriptures a lot is hidden under
[22:42] them but I pray father that you may give
[22:46] Grace very special Grace father that you
[22:50] may Feed Us from what you have hidden
[22:53] under those
[22:54] scriptures by the power of the Holy
[22:57] Spirit
[22:59] bring quickening power father to every
[23:02] elected seed
[23:04] here they may
[23:06] Rejoice father dear Lord God in the
[23:10] newness of
[23:12] life we are committing to you the needs
[23:15] of every person
[23:17] here father I pray that you may just go
[23:20] back and
[23:22] forth touching every one of them in
[23:26] Jesus name amen you may be
[23:31] seated so it's a blessing to be in the
[23:33] house of the
[23:35] Lord and U honestly I was saying a few
[23:41] things Amen on the platform of the
[23:45] church I felt like I should really start
[23:51] participating amen so that we can keep
[23:55] talking to one
[23:56] another
[23:58] I was saying that the only joy of any
[24:03] minister is the same
[24:06] Joy of
[24:10] lady when she makes
[24:13] the there must be somebody eat
[24:16] it if you want trouble in the
[24:19] house let your wife keep cooking the
[24:23] food and then you just say it's okay
[24:26] good food but I not
[24:29] EA you are going to have a lot of
[24:32] trouble thank you for coming over to
[24:36] listen to me
[24:38] speak that's the reason why I have a
[24:42] call is because of you
[24:45] people the Lord has picked us from very
[24:49] far very very far God told
[24:54] David that I picked you from following
[24:59] ship you know just where the sheep goes
[25:03] that's where David went and then brought
[25:06] him into the Hors a
[25:09] king so the church came from very
[25:12] far there are brothers like
[25:16] brother brother David here that can tell
[25:20] where we came
[25:21] from and I appreciate you all for your
[25:25] faithfulness it's not being fath fa F to
[25:28] me is being faithful to he who called
[25:32] you amen we've got
[25:35] children and children have
[25:38] children and we are multiplying every
[25:41] day so let us just keep that
[25:46] Focus for the sake of the children that
[25:49] God has given to
[25:51] us so today I'm going to speak about
[25:55] kingship with God
[25:59] yeah you see the kingship with
[26:02] God the prophet in several areas of his
[26:07] ministry did everything possible to
[26:09] define the family of
[26:13] God you know we are a family if a
[26:17] brother wakes up in the natural
[26:20] family and walks whenever to
[26:24] return it robs peace from that house
[26:29] you keep wondering what happened to our
[26:32] brother what happened to our
[26:34] sister that's the way God does even we
[26:38] here we are a family in the body of
[26:43] Christ brother Bram used these words and
[26:46] says I'm a Bram by
[26:51] birth and you are a Christian by
[26:55] birth you don't join the family of God
[26:59] you are born in the family of
[27:03] God is that amen yeah we don't join the
[27:08] family we are born into it we are part
[27:11] of everything good in that
[27:14] family and we also part of everything
[27:17] bad in that
[27:19] family if the family is poor you don't
[27:22] deny the family because they are
[27:25] poor we are born in to it we cannot
[27:29] choose to join another
[27:32] family and then you begin rejoicing that
[27:34] I've come to a very rich
[27:37] family we are a part of the family of
[27:40] God by
[27:42] bus so we are in the family by a life
[27:47] it's a
[27:49] life brother Bram says these
[27:52] words now when the member is born by the
[27:55] Holy Ghost into the family of
[28:00] God and as provent to have these virtues
[28:04] in
[28:06] him that God can see
[28:10] virtue
[28:12] knowledge
[28:14] Temperance and patience brotherly
[28:18] kindness and godliness in him then
[28:22] God seals him or blesses him
[28:29] and there thus when you see the sons of
[28:32] God and Daughters of
[28:37] God we don't see Sons and Daughters of
[28:42] God by those who come to
[28:45] church but with sons and daughters of
[28:49] God whom God has seal his life in
[28:54] them and completely now he sees his life
[28:59] emanated through those
[29:02] people he says God then places
[29:07] them he seals them and he says that's
[29:11] the only we can tell a son and of
[29:15] God so in the
[29:17] family there is a genetic
[29:21] flaw
[29:23] influence amen you see this brother here
[29:28] when you see another brother somewhere
[29:30] else there is something that puts you
[29:34] together amen are you together with me
[29:38] there is a genetic
[29:41] flow when you see the family of Brother
[29:44] David even if you've never seen
[29:48] Joshua and then you've seen Dan there is
[29:51] something that always
[29:54] strikes it's a genetic influence
[29:58] is not something that you are going to
[30:00] put
[30:01] on it's a form of life that's managed by
[30:07] nature and that's literally un
[30:10] Inseparable from the
[30:14] G you don't have to to train how to walk
[30:18] like a
[30:20] family is naturally in on the inside of
[30:24] you are you together with me you cannot
[30:28] say
[30:29] today I want to get in the muto
[30:32] family and I start looking like them I
[30:36] start talking like them I know there are
[30:39] some that have trained like that when
[30:42] they become
[30:43] ministers they want to speak like their
[30:46] pastors but Wilson is not like that
[30:49] brother James is not like that you know
[30:52] all these young people done is not like
[30:55] that amen they are naturally what they
[31:01] are amen it's a genetic
[31:05] attribute a thing that comes from the
[31:09] SE amen and you look like your
[31:12] father and you laugh like your father
[31:15] it's a nature it's a life you are born
[31:19] into it Amen brother Bram says man in
[31:23] the
[31:26] beginning when he was
[31:28] made a man is a
[31:32] god he's absolutely a
[31:36] God for he was made in the image of
[31:39] God being a Son of God and then he is of
[31:45] all that God
[31:50] is amen not ha to what God
[31:56] has but ha to what God
[32:01] is meaning that you develop
[32:05] nature which is literally like a
[32:09] god you put on an
[32:12] image so this
[32:14] inheritance is a nature that can bring
[32:18] forth the
[32:20] supernatural because it's God
[32:22] himself so you just let me allow God
[32:28] himself through
[32:29] me amen you don't put on a fire you
[32:34] don't struggle to
[32:36] love you don't struggle to
[32:40] love you don't struggle to to be
[32:45] paent you don't struggle to be
[32:48] me it the nature it's part of you you
[32:53] don't struggle to
[32:54] forgive because it's a nature
[32:58] and it says that we are here to what God
[33:03] is we are here to Faith we are here
[33:08] tot we are here to
[33:10] knowledge we are here to Pence we are ha
[33:14] to
[33:14] Godliness we are ha to brotherly
[33:17] kindness we become a hair of
[33:22] nature amen thank you if you've got that
[33:27] praise the Lord amen do you love him you
[33:31] see you become a of what God
[33:34] is meaning that a nature of
[33:38] God begin to display itself through
[33:43] you because the all things that you come
[33:46] from God
[33:51] by this inheritance we are talking
[33:54] of is a nature that can bring
[33:58] forth all the works of God just
[34:05] involuntarily amen so brother Bram
[34:09] says that being a Son of
[34:13] God you are a nature of
[34:17] God that's what it means to be a Son of
[34:20] God you are a of
[34:23] God so listen now
[34:28] procreation we are dealing with
[34:33] je amen so when a child is born in a
[34:37] family and they want verify and
[34:41] confirm that this child belongs to the
[34:45] family they deal with
[34:48] jeans are you together with me they deal
[34:51] with
[34:52] Jes so you know being passed on
[34:56] throughout one of
[34:59] spring because that's the law of
[35:02] nature everything reproduces from its
[35:05] own
[35:08] kind so we look for the the the center
[35:11] of
[35:12] [Music]
[35:13] life that's the
[35:15] Gen that's why the prophet saying being
[35:18] a Son of
[35:19] God you are a nature of
[35:23] God you are ha to what God is
[35:28] not what God has because what God has
[35:32] people can extend a hand and touch
[35:35] it even when they are not part of
[35:39] God do you remember what on
[35:42] Fai amen so that's why God
[35:46] says in Genesis
[35:49] 111 and God said let the Earth bring
[35:53] forth
[35:55] grass the have yielding
[36:00] seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[36:04] after
[36:05] [Music]
[36:09] his whose seed is in
[36:14] itself whose gen is in
[36:18] itself upon the Earth and it was
[36:22] so so that's the law of
[36:25] nature fruit after his
[36:29] kind you put an app
[36:32] seed the life on there is the life of an
[36:36] apple you don't get an appc about
[36:40] it you just get an Apple because that's
[36:43] what you put in the
[36:45] ground that's the
[36:47] seed in itself so that's the law of
[36:52] Nature and that's why the natur of
[36:55] K
[36:57] and ab could not be
[37:01] compatible because they originate from
[37:04] totally two different
[37:07] sources
[37:09] amen was of the evil
[37:12] one and then you know Abel was from
[37:16] Adam so they could not have the same
[37:20] gen because they came from they didn't
[37:23] come from the same
[37:25] Source the ground can be the
[37:28] same but it can bring forth every type
[37:32] of seed that you put on
[37:36] it amen and that's why in God making
[37:41] man he said let us make money in our
[37:46] image and our likeness let us allow the
[37:51] SE come through man to represent God
[37:55] here on Earth
[37:57] amen So Adam proceeded from the
[38:00] spiritual Gene of
[38:02] God to this the nature of God here on
[38:06] Earth like you plant
[38:09] being God also planted in
[38:13] Sea in a ground that's called
[38:17] Adam so Adam came here on Earth to
[38:21] display the nature of God your new birth
[38:26] God quickening that se which is on the
[38:30] inside of you that you may display what
[38:33] God
[38:35] is is that amen that's a wonderful
[38:39] thing so I've always told you that the
[38:43] way God
[38:44] works when he was
[38:46] creating this was God now and he says
[38:50] let us make m in our own image in any
[38:55] case is saying
[38:57] let us
[38:58] allow a little off of
[39:02] our and
[39:04] make so this man here is the nature of
[39:08] God Amen the body he was put in it's
[39:13] just that seed being ground planted in a
[39:18] ground so that it can come forth and be
[39:23] able to display the nature of
[39:25] God a certain scripture comes my way
[39:29] now that's in Hebrews chapter
[39:32] 1 the invisible was made
[39:36] visible by planting a seed in the ground
[39:41] amen so the scripture says in Hebrews
[39:45] chapter
[39:46] 1 and verse one God who times and in
[39:51] diverse manners spake in time past unto
[39:55] the father's
[39:57] by the
[40:06] prophets amen it was God in the
[40:11] prophets it was God in
[40:14] David it was God in
[40:16] Samuel it was God in Joseph whatever
[40:20] they
[40:22] did it was God in those
[40:25] people then he says here has in this
[40:28] last days spoken unto us by his son
[40:32] meaning through his
[40:41] son he has appointed he of All Things by
[40:45] whom also he made the
[40:49] [Music]
[40:50] [Applause]
[40:54] world and he is the brightness of his
[41:01] glory the express image of his
[41:07] person now the person of God is spirit
[41:11] and is
[41:14] invisible but when he stepped into
[41:17] Christ Christ became the express
[41:22] image of the invisible
[41:24] God that's why he say
[41:27] I came in my father's name I came under
[41:31] the character of my father I come to
[41:34] displ what my father
[41:36] is are you together with me amen and I
[41:40] want to say God created Adam and placed
[41:44] him in a body of
[41:46] Flesh Adam was here to take care the
[41:50] invisible
[41:51] God Amen praise God and that's why when
[41:56] Adam
[41:58] fell he could be
[42:01] redeemable because the life which was on
[42:03] the side of
[42:05] him was God
[42:08] himself are you together with me that's
[42:11] why Adam could be
[42:14] redeemed because the life on the side
[42:17] was
[42:18] God that life is
[42:24] eternal why don't you ask why are you
[42:28] here you come down here naturally you
[42:32] would have a lot of things to
[42:34] do you would have many friends to
[42:37] Vis you have some businesses to
[42:40] do there is something that P and you
[42:44] come to the house of
[42:46] God why do you believe what you
[42:49] believe you see somehow there are so
[42:52] many natural
[42:54] things that could even make you
[42:58] doubt and that's true but down there
[43:01] there is something that
[43:03] holds the Eternal gen on the inside of
[43:08] you it can never part with
[43:11] you it will bring you into a
[43:15] way to manifest the life of
[43:19] God hallelujah hallelujah amen you are
[43:23] redeemable because on the inside of you
[43:25] there's the SE of
[43:27] God you are redeemable because the life
[43:30] on the inside of you is
[43:33] eternal amen you are not getting to
[43:37] believe so that you may have eternal
[43:40] life that's not what it is you are
[43:43] redeemed because you are Eternal
[43:47] Redemption is bringing it back to the
[43:52] or isn't that wonderful that God is
[43:56] restoring you the enemy tried to wave
[43:59] you this way the storms pull you this
[44:02] way but you are redeemable God keeps
[44:06] bringing you
[44:08] back are you together with me amen
[44:12] that's John
[44:14] 5:24 very to
[44:17] you he that Heth my
[44:20] word and believeth on him that sent
[44:24] me has ever everting
[44:27] life you don't believe to get
[44:30] everlasting
[44:31] life but you believe because you have
[44:34] everlasting life a life on the side of
[44:38] you that always seeks for
[44:42] God Amen it's like a
[44:46] compass amen it's on the side of you and
[44:49] it always locate the
[44:52] north amen it will always locate the no
[44:57] star it will always bring you to Christ
[45:01] in the midst of your
[45:03] troubles even when
[45:05] you in many different things there is
[45:09] something that keeps ping toward the
[45:11] North
[45:13] Star amen praise God we don't believe to
[45:18] receive eternal
[45:19] life we believe because the seed On th
[45:23] side is God himself
[45:26] that is why we have the Fountain of
[45:30] blood Amen to maintain you
[45:34] clean before
[45:36] the amen and this Blood here is for the
[45:40] elect because they have eternal
[45:43] life you know the enemy tries to take
[45:46] them this
[45:48] way but the voice calls you
[45:51] back and the blood is in that voice it
[45:56] keeps bringing you back to maintain you
[46:00] clean because the seed on the inside of
[46:03] you is God
[46:06] himself
[46:08] amen now when Adam took the body of
[46:13] Flesh listen he fell by
[46:21] [Music]
[46:24] sin
[46:27] amen and in this
[46:30] fall there was
[46:34] hybridization through the 16 organic
[46:37] Elements which make our
[46:41] body but the gene of
[46:43] life on the inside could not be reached
[46:47] by the
[46:51] hyd when hybridization happen
[46:57] and there was a strange nature of life
[47:01] that
[47:05] contracted amen the seed on the
[47:09] inside could not be
[47:14] touched I don't know whether you
[47:16] understand what I the seed on the side
[47:21] could not be T you've got something on
[47:24] the side
[47:26] that sin cannot
[47:28] come and totally
[47:33] overpower I don't say that you cannot
[47:38] STG you can that's why we have
[47:42] scripture that he leaves the
[47:45] 99 to go for one you can St but you
[47:49] cannot get
[47:51] lost I'm not talking to everybody now
[47:55] talking to those who are the seed of
[47:58] life from before the foundation of the
[48:02] world there is nothing that can
[48:05] completely separate them from
[48:09] God they will always be a deep calling
[48:12] to the
[48:14] Deep amen there is something in you that
[48:19] the devil cannot
[48:22] reach it is called life it cannot mix
[48:27] with
[48:30] death are you together with me it cannot
[48:33] mix with
[48:35] death because when the devil came and
[48:39] brought sin in the life of Adam the
[48:42] death did not go for the
[48:45] soul the death came by the
[48:48] flesh by which Adam
[48:51] s that's why Adam can not die a second
[48:56] death because he was
[48:58] redeemed that's why you cannot die a
[49:01] second death because you are
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:06] redeemed the effects of
[49:08] sin can affect this
[49:11] flesh you can become sick you can be
[49:15] buffeted by taking you into Hebrews
[49:18] chapter
[49:20] 12 to chastise you but the seed On th
[49:24] side we always be saved you are a child
[49:29] of God born of God and he did not redeem
[49:33] you to lose you he redeemed you to make
[49:37] sure that he brings you back
[49:41] home amen praise the Lord amen last week
[49:46] I was talking about looking at one
[49:51] another by the ey of God Amen so I I
[49:57] just can't
[50:00] understand the grace of God the love of
[50:03] God the goodness of God it
[50:07] surpasses you see sometimes we want to
[50:09] bring
[50:11] God and put him in the bracket of
[50:16] men but God knew the end from the
[50:21] beginning are you together with me
[50:24] that's why he said
[50:26] he can never lose
[50:28] you why do you want to believe you can
[50:30] be
[50:35] lost you
[50:37] cannot that's not why you were
[50:41] redeemed amen the gene of life may be
[50:47] dant for a long
[50:49] spell of time in your life 10 years 30
[50:54] years
[50:55] 40 years 50 years the seed of life is
[51:02] D but it's right there because it is
[51:07] eternal
[51:10] life amen so it is this side there could
[51:15] be D for a little
[51:18] while but when the light of the word
[51:20] strikes
[51:22] it and the life on the inside of
[51:26] Wicked then you realize you've been
[51:29] Eternal from before the foundation of
[51:31] the
[51:35] world let there be light and then the
[51:38] seeds would come forth let there be
[51:41] light of the word of God when the sein
[51:45] on the inside
[51:49] awakens
[51:51] amen yes
[51:54] therefore we did not become
[51:57] seed by the
[52:00] rebirth we were seed and therefore we
[52:03] were
[52:05] reborn for only the
[52:08] elect can be
[52:11] reborn amen because we were
[52:15] see is the reason we could be
[52:19] quickened
[52:23] in there's nothing to Quicken
[52:28] are you together with me because you
[52:30] were see there is something that appaled
[52:36] to and you said Lord forgive me Lord
[52:42] a it's only the
[52:45] seed that can realize you need help from
[52:50] God
[52:52] only that can cry for redemp
[52:58] it's only SE that can
[53:01] submit to the leadership of the Holy
[53:05] Spirit praise the Lord are you together
[53:09] with me you may say brother
[53:12] Steven what about those who
[53:15] believe and then STG along the
[53:19] way the
[53:20] answer is that the Good
[53:23] Shepherd BL them into Hebrews
[53:27] 12 to perfect their
[53:31] character Hebrews
[53:33] 12 to perfect their
[53:36] character let's go to Hebrews
[53:39] 12 in Hebrews
[53:41] 12 he makes them appreciate the
[53:46] concept of uh Psalms
[53:50] 23 where he says thy Road and thy staff
[53:54] they come from
[54:02] [Music]
[54:04] are you together with me he makes you
[54:07] appreciate that
[54:10] concept that God can get a
[54:15] road God can get a
[54:18] stuff to help the
[54:23] ship I was saying when I was on an
[54:26] interview on
[54:30] Friday saying
[54:32] that how do you
[54:35] handle the people who criticize
[54:40] you I say I ignore
[54:46] them I ignore them because this is a man
[54:50] trying to pull you into a
[54:52] fight why would you fight him
[54:56] the Bible doesn't allow me to
[54:58] fight I just ignore
[55:01] them and then the brother says oh you
[55:04] know some brothers uh take them on in
[55:07] their
[55:13] church because if they don't the people
[55:15] will
[55:17] go I told him it's okay if they go God
[55:22] didn't orain them for me
[55:26] to take them beyond the curtain
[55:29] of you see what I mean so I brought the
[55:34] concept of the
[55:36] L and the
[55:38] Sheep God told Peter feed my
[55:43] lamb feed my
[55:45] lamb feed my sheep but would you know
[55:49] why Jesus the most mature that a
[55:53] Christian can be
[55:57] was never referred to
[56:00] wor he was always called a
[56:04] lamb he never grew beyond the
[56:08] lamb he was always a
[56:12] lamb sheep
[56:16] devops an independent
[56:20] mind it can
[56:22] argue it can fight
[56:25] ship can kick the
[56:29] shepher that's
[56:32] ship and the
[56:35] Sheep doesn't
[56:37] normally
[56:39] recognize some the authority of the
[56:43] shepherd that's why Isaiah
[56:45] says all we like
[56:50] sheep have gone
[56:53] astray he doesn't say we like
[56:56] Lambs all we like
[56:59] sheep sheep devolves an independent
[57:03] mind and when one ship
[57:06] goes all the others will
[57:10] follow they'll just go by the time they
[57:14] get
[57:15] there but why have we come here I don't
[57:19] know but we are
[57:23] here that is ship
[57:26] [Music]
[57:28] in one sheep jumped over
[57:33] a and it died a second one came a third
[57:38] one came 1,500
[57:44] sheep and the man lost
[57:47] them you see when you see all these
[57:50] churches where people get
[57:53] turo it's not because they are not
[57:56] children of
[57:58] God but they've assumed the level of
[58:04] sheep Jesus never became
[58:07] sheep he always remained a
[58:10] l but God told
[58:13] Peter even for those
[58:15] sheep feed
[58:18] them what do you feed them for so that
[58:22] they can be able to Humble them
[58:26] to the nature of the
[58:28] Lamb are you together with me will you
[58:31] be lamb
[58:33] forever amen God be
[58:35] gracious so in Hebrews
[58:38] 12 that's where we get the
[58:42] concept of Thy word and thy stuff they
[58:45] comfort
[58:47] me and this Comfort
[58:50] here comes in a state of
[58:53] pain
[58:55] because here in Hebrews chapter
[58:58] 12 amen he says in verse
[59:04] three for consider him ended such
[59:08] contradiction of Sinners against
[59:21] himself lest he be worried and faint in
[59:24] your
[59:29] mind you have not resisted
[59:33] yet I mean resisted unto blood striving
[59:38] against
[59:43] him
[59:44] Jesus was
[59:47] perfect but he
[59:49] fought the contradiction of
[59:53] sinners you call yourself a Son of God
[59:58] you are not even 50
[59:59] years you said before Abraham was I
[1:00:03] am he
[1:00:05] resisted the
[1:00:08] contradiction but you he says you have
[1:00:13] also to put on some form of
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:18] resistance on the other side so that you
[1:00:22] may not give up because you are being
[1:00:26] tried to get your nature and character
[1:00:31] perfect he says in verse 5 you have
[1:00:34] forgotten the ex exaltation which
[1:00:38] speaketh unto you as unto
[1:00:48] children my
[1:00:50] son despise not the chastisement of the
[1:00:54] Lord
[1:00:56] no faint thou when thou are rebuked of
[1:01:03] him for whom the Lord
[1:01:06] loveth he
[1:01:08] chth and sces every son whom he
[1:01:13] receive now in verse
[1:01:15] 11 he says now no
[1:01:19] chastisement for the present seeth to be
[1:01:23] joyous
[1:01:30] but
[1:01:32] Grievous nevertheless
[1:01:35] afterward it heals the Peaceable fruit
[1:01:38] of
[1:01:41] righteousness unto them that are
[1:01:44] exercised
[1:01:49] thereby thy Road and thy
[1:01:52] staff goes for the one
[1:01:55] ship which is always getting out of the
[1:02:01] C and this is not because the Lord has
[1:02:04] the
[1:02:08] Sheep but whom the Lord
[1:02:15] love so if he and you are
[1:02:19] Destiny amen you need to devel patience
[1:02:27] temp that God may have a thorough
[1:02:31] work at the end of the day you are going
[1:02:35] to be benefited by
[1:02:38] that amen So when you say oh brother we
[1:02:42] used to have brother so and so here
[1:02:45] brother so and so here if there were
[1:02:48] part of that Eternal
[1:02:51] economy then God
[1:02:53] himself will go after
[1:02:58] them and puts them under
[1:03:02] chastisement he sters them in Babylon
[1:03:05] for 70
[1:03:07] years and then brings them back when
[1:03:10] they've got a great
[1:03:12] Zeal they build the Tabernacle
[1:03:16] again anything that's against the
[1:03:19] building of the Tabernacle they build me
[1:03:23] back the house of God again that's the
[1:03:26] way God
[1:03:27] works amen there will be a bride because
[1:03:33] she's an eternal
[1:03:35] gen much as she's ened in the Natural
[1:03:40] Body amen God has done all the means to
[1:03:45] make sure that you make
[1:03:47] it he'll make sure that you wash your
[1:03:51] feet amen last Sunday we had foot
[1:03:54] washing
[1:03:56] here amen and you know it's a symbol of
[1:04:01] humility but yet at the same
[1:04:04] time it is also a symbol that you are
[1:04:08] willing to walk under the
[1:04:13] blood I mean the
[1:04:15] blood together with me amen listen now
[1:04:21] when the frot washing
[1:04:23] came says you cannot wash my
[1:04:26] feet then Jesus says if I don't wash
[1:04:30] your
[1:04:31] feet you have no part in
[1:04:34] me are you together with me you can't be
[1:04:37] constantly be part of my
[1:04:42] body because your part the feet your
[1:04:46] walking must under
[1:04:51] cleaning amen you walk
[1:04:54] you get yourself that back and
[1:04:57] forth you come and wash your
[1:05:00] feet amen God has put a provision for us
[1:05:04] that we have to keep our feet
[1:05:07] clean we've got the SCS
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:11] on Amen but the scripture says keep your
[1:05:15] SCS clean we come down here to get our
[1:05:19] SCS
[1:05:20] washed amen there will be a bre
[1:05:25] because the blood shall never lose its
[1:05:28] power until the last Ransom the
[1:05:32] wor Amen to see no
[1:05:35] more amen praise God yes sir so you know
[1:05:41] those Hybrid
[1:05:43] Bodies this body is here so brother Bram
[1:05:48] knew that his natural
[1:05:51] Gene the Bram Gene
[1:05:55] not the seed gen of
[1:05:58] God he he knew that it was
[1:06:03] hidden in the same
[1:06:06] body with the seed
[1:06:08] gen that Eternal gen of
[1:06:12] God that's why when he would get here in
[1:06:16] the
[1:06:17] platform and he was going to start his
[1:06:21] service he says now let williiam Bram
[1:06:23] get
[1:06:26] are you together with me he knew that
[1:06:29] some
[1:06:31] somewhere the spirit the human Spirit
[1:06:35] that's where the nature of char andam
[1:06:41] live amen yeah he knew that but he says
[1:06:46] God have mercy that I may raise a level
[1:06:52] higher amen to the point where David
[1:06:55] will go into the house of
[1:06:58] God and he says praise the Lord all my
[1:07:02] soul and all that's within me amen he
[1:07:06] was appealing to the SE
[1:07:08] G the in the soul that's freen by the
[1:07:12] Holy Spirit and that's what we are
[1:07:16] that's why we have the
[1:07:18] battles of
[1:07:22] Romans
[1:07:26] praise the
[1:07:27] Lord
[1:07:29] amen so the same
[1:07:32] body this body here is the
[1:07:40] devil's and then right there we get the
[1:07:43] concept of the
[1:07:48] twins Kan
[1:07:52] and in the body in the
[1:07:56] garden we've got two distinct
[1:08:01] species in the Garden of
[1:08:04] Eden the wheat
[1:08:09] seed
[1:08:11] and
[1:08:15] tears which
[1:08:18] is and somehow
[1:08:21] somewhere those things bother you
[1:08:25] in teaching the
[1:08:28] message uh Kingsman
[1:08:33] Redeemer brother Bram says when
[1:08:36] Bo came to the time of redeeming
[1:08:40] R he went to the
[1:08:42] gate and gave
[1:08:45] chance and
[1:08:47] opportunity to the nearest
[1:08:51] Kinsman which was near
[1:08:55] Truth
[1:08:59] than this man looked at what he
[1:09:04] had and he says this truth
[1:09:07] here is a very expensive
[1:09:10] woman if I go to redeem her I'll my
[1:09:19] inheritance and he
[1:09:21] says given and then the
[1:09:24] says that the
[1:09:27] near is the
[1:09:31] devil are you together with me he has
[1:09:35] access to
[1:09:37] this he's the near
[1:09:41] kman but he cannot redeem the
[1:09:45] soul and restore it into the bride
[1:09:50] status because the price meant
[1:09:55] death and then back to life the devil
[1:09:59] couldn't do
[1:10:01] that are you together with me so
[1:10:05] c a product without a spiritual
[1:10:10] gen amen
[1:10:13] where had the Gen of
[1:10:16] God and he could hear from God by
[1:10:19] Revelation they both lived in the same
[1:10:22] Garden hallelujah hallelujah and when
[1:10:26] God
[1:10:27] spoke he says I want a
[1:10:30] sacrifice both of
[1:10:33] them but
[1:10:36] then by
[1:10:39] the but this man
[1:10:42] came heard by the
[1:10:44] ear and he went and brought the fruits
[1:10:47] of the
[1:10:51] ground are you together with me in this
[1:10:54] body here and so brother Bram always
[1:10:58] said let William Bram step
[1:11:02] out he has anger he has malice he has
[1:11:07] Envy he has this he had that how can you
[1:11:12] be greater than me he has all those kind
[1:11:14] of things you cannot H those things and
[1:11:18] be a servant of God at the same time you
[1:11:21] cannot H those things and to be a child
[1:11:24] of God at the same time those parts
[1:11:28] belong to the near
[1:11:31] K and we need to get out of that there
[1:11:35] must be perfect love flow out of us from
[1:11:40] the gene of
[1:11:43] life
[1:11:45] amen when the flesh man was
[1:11:50] hybridized Lucifer got himself hiding
[1:11:59] Place hiding
[1:12:02] place in your human
[1:12:06] Spirit the twin
[1:12:10] princi and that's why Paul say I find
[1:12:14] the
[1:12:18] law that when I would do
[1:12:21] good evil is present
[1:12:25] with he wants to do
[1:12:28] good but the
[1:12:30] easiest is evil
[1:12:34] before but regardless of the invion of
[1:12:38] evil there is an eternal
[1:12:43] gen on the
[1:12:45] inside that from God by Perfect
[1:12:52] fath and what he hears translates
[1:12:57] Revelation and how you
[1:12:59] overcome evil one on the
[1:13:04] outside
[1:13:06] amen that's what Paul
[1:13:09] says so then Faith cometh by
[1:13:13] hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:13:18] God by the word of
[1:13:21] God Amen so
[1:13:24] this is
[1:13:26] God Elohim elim Jehovah God is the
[1:13:32] word when you get off there by you know
[1:13:36] God creating you of
[1:13:40] himself then you become part of the
[1:13:44] word and then you hear the
[1:13:48] word the
[1:13:50] word the
[1:13:52] G makes you different from the rest of
[1:13:56] the
[1:13:59] world are you together with me the seed
[1:14:03] chin is the part of God that you
[1:14:06] are and that's the Son of
[1:14:09] God that God speaks
[1:14:14] to you know you can go on a political
[1:14:19] rally you hear everything by your ears
[1:14:23] but when you sit in church it is
[1:14:27] different you feel like you are hearing
[1:14:30] it from a different
[1:14:34] angle when you hear in the political
[1:14:39] rally 40 people were
[1:14:43] killed it is 40 people but when you come
[1:14:47] down here and we are talking about twins
[1:14:51] we are talking about jeans
[1:14:54] you are not in the scientific field the
[1:14:57] holy spirit will be talking to you from
[1:14:59] another
[1:15:01] Channel aren't you happy we have the
[1:15:04] capacity to hear from
[1:15:07] God Amen praise the Lord the Gen is a
[1:15:12] part of
[1:15:14] God Amen I want you to hear what the
[1:15:17] prophet
[1:15:18] says now you see we not a divided
[1:15:26] people we've got to be in
[1:15:30] unity because each one of
[1:15:33] us is holding a part of God hallelujah
[1:15:38] hallelujah so when
[1:15:41] God made
[1:15:43] man and hid that seed On th
[1:15:47] side then it has
[1:15:50] multiplied it has multiplied
[1:15:53] and every one of us is a part of
[1:15:59] God did you hear what I say you are a
[1:16:03] part of God and we must come
[1:16:07] together and then the pill of
[1:16:11] fire is manifested in the
[1:16:15] Wess in the fullness of it when his
[1:16:19] church sits
[1:16:22] together Heavenly
[1:16:24] places then the fullness of the power of
[1:16:27] God is in his
[1:16:32] church together with me when you are by
[1:16:35] yourself at
[1:16:37] home yes you are a part of God but there
[1:16:42] is a part that you are
[1:16:44] missing you are missing the part called
[1:16:48] me they are missing a part called
[1:16:51] another brother you are missing a part
[1:16:54] called the
[1:16:56] singer everyone is Anointed in a special
[1:17:00] way and when we come together and we
[1:17:04] bring our leaks of fire together I tell
[1:17:08] you brother there is more of God Among
[1:17:11] Us than when you stay back home
[1:17:18] alone amen am he says when his church
[1:17:22] sits together
[1:17:24] places then the fullness of the power of
[1:17:27] God in his church each one of us holding
[1:17:32] spiritual
[1:17:33] gifts and spiritual
[1:17:36] offices coming together brings that pill
[1:17:40] of fire back
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:43] again amen that's now an eternal
[1:17:47] spiritual
[1:17:50] Fellowship did you hear what I say
[1:17:53] yes sir we are not talking about this
[1:17:57] flesh no sir you may not like this man
[1:18:01] here because of the way looks
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:11] like but we don't come here to
[1:18:14] appreciate our
[1:18:16] looks we come here to get connected to
[1:18:19] that gen
[1:18:21] of
[1:18:23] are you together with me that's what
[1:18:26] brings us
[1:18:27] together one time there was a man called
[1:18:32] David he was so
[1:18:34] anointed that when he begins to sing
[1:18:37] demon flee and so was always
[1:18:42] depressed he didn't like
[1:18:44] David he would have desired to kill him
[1:18:48] but each time he came into the
[1:18:50] services where David was and was tring
[1:18:54] his that would flee we don't come
[1:18:58] together because we love one another in
[1:19:01] the natural aspect we come together
[1:19:05] because we are a part of
[1:19:10] God
[1:19:12] Amen so now the
[1:19:21] muline and we who came off of him we are
[1:19:27] the
[1:19:28] bride and when the
[1:19:32] m and The
[1:19:35] Feminine come
[1:19:42] together and that's what we call the son
[1:19:44] of
[1:19:46] God is
[1:19:48] the that comes out of
[1:19:51] that
[1:19:54] that's what the Son of
[1:19:56] God so we are the nature of God
[1:20:00] here amen gathered
[1:20:05] together
[1:20:06] amen therefore have more of
[1:20:10] God and the atmosphere of God here is
[1:20:14] greater than when you
[1:20:16] alone and when you have that
[1:20:19] understanding and you're in the house of
[1:20:21] God Anything Can
[1:20:24] Happen yes sir anything can happen you
[1:20:28] can get healed you can get
[1:20:32] sealed in the B of the Holy Ghost you
[1:20:36] can ask for your way one children God
[1:20:39] can give them to
[1:20:41] you amen because you were in a special
[1:20:47] presence amen and from
[1:20:51] beginning the devil always
[1:20:54] desired to be part of this kind of
[1:20:59] atmosphere he knew what that
[1:21:02] atmosphere when he was in
[1:21:05] heaven it was an electric
[1:21:09] atmosphere a glorious
[1:21:12] atmosphere but when he
[1:21:15] broke he wanted to be born back into
[1:21:17] that
[1:21:19] atmosphere but his nature doesn't
[1:21:24] CH each time he gets back into that
[1:21:28] atmosphere his
[1:21:36] desire he went to the
[1:21:40] fellow and he was hunting
[1:21:48] for he would
[1:21:50] always let me tell you something
[1:21:53] do you know that you are under
[1:21:57] seal do you know that the devil cannot
[1:22:00] reach
[1:22:01] you unless God
[1:22:03] allows he cannot reach it he can't you
[1:22:08] are sealed down in
[1:22:11] the are you together with me he comes he
[1:22:16] comes and God asks
[1:22:19] him
[1:22:21] Lucifer
[1:22:23] come
[1:22:24] fellowship and
[1:22:30] say maybe you thought about my servant
[1:22:34] job and that
[1:22:36] one he loves you
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:22:40] because does not fall sick you keep that
[1:22:43] command does not fall
[1:22:45] sick he says you think
[1:22:48] so I can
[1:22:50] allow and then you touch it
[1:22:57] and God
[1:23:00] allowed and he buffeted the
[1:23:02] body he could not reach the
[1:23:06] soul he took all his
[1:23:09] wealth but he could not reach
[1:23:13] this I want to say that the devil always
[1:23:18] deserved this
[1:23:20] atmosphere and brother Bram say the
[1:23:24] devil never misses
[1:23:29] church he can never miss
[1:23:33] church he's always there in
[1:23:37] service whom can I
[1:23:40] Divine whom can
[1:23:42] I but the
[1:23:44] seed is in such a secure
[1:23:48] place that the devil cannot reach
[1:23:54] bothering you he may bother
[1:23:58] you but he can never get to who you
[1:24:03] are
[1:24:05] amen he always desired to be part of
[1:24:08] this kind of
[1:24:10] atmosphere and the prophet says it was
[1:24:14] impossible for
[1:24:16] Satan for is not a created spirit
[1:24:20] being to repr himself in the
[1:24:25] manner which God reproduced
[1:24:28] himself so that Genesis tells how he
[1:24:33] produced
[1:24:36] his and introduced so injected himself
[1:24:40] into the human
[1:24:43] race so he fails behind the same color
[1:24:47] of skin
[1:24:50] now because he was finally
[1:24:54] Bor by a
[1:24:59] natural and he
[1:25:02] came into
[1:25:04] the domain of
[1:25:08] men and began to Veil behind this
[1:25:14] King so
[1:25:16] that he then had
[1:25:19] access to get your human spirit
[1:25:24] he could stain the human
[1:25:26] Spirit to stain
[1:25:31] it by reasoning like he did even in the
[1:25:36] garden so ining with his
[1:25:40] children God deals with the seed
[1:25:44] Gene that's part of the Eternal
[1:25:49] Word it's not this that God deals
[1:25:56] with are you still here this
[1:25:59] morning amen let me try to see how I can
[1:26:03] wind up with
[1:26:05] this amen so now the devil had access to
[1:26:09] the
[1:26:11] garden and now
[1:26:14] ab ab and they in the same
[1:26:19] garden and today you the
[1:26:23] garden amen the devil has access to your
[1:26:27] human
[1:26:28] Spirit but God has access to
[1:26:32] yourself the devil has access
[1:26:36] reason God has access to Faith in the
[1:26:40] same
[1:26:41] Garden we cannot tell who you
[1:26:44] are except when we
[1:26:47] check
[1:26:49] your by the word
[1:26:53] amen let's go to John chapter
[1:26:57] 8 and verse
[1:27:00] 42 Jesus said unto
[1:27:04] them if God were your
[1:27:08] father he would love
[1:27:15] me for I proceed forth and came from
[1:27:19] God neither came I of myself but he sent
[1:27:28] me your
[1:27:30] father you would love me so the
[1:27:34] separating
[1:27:36] now is the word
[1:27:39] test you would love me meaning that if
[1:27:44] you came from
[1:27:46] God will always call to the
[1:27:50] Deep amen he came by John
[1:27:55] 3:16 because he loved
[1:27:58] you and those that his will be maged to
[1:28:03] that
[1:28:04] love I love God
[1:28:08] back and then love one
[1:28:14] another are you together with me if you
[1:28:18] were of
[1:28:20] God you would love me
[1:28:26] because I didn't come on my own God sent
[1:28:29] me John
[1:28:32] 3:16 and those that are his will be
[1:28:36] magnetized to that
[1:28:38] L that's the C of love
[1:28:41] now amen from the
[1:28:44] father to the
[1:28:46] children and to one
[1:28:49] another my God God loved me and I love
[1:28:54] him back by his love and the sign is if
[1:28:59] we love one
[1:29:03] another just turn around and tell a
[1:29:05] brother or a sister I love
[1:29:09] you it's not you but the seed
[1:29:18] on he
[1:29:20] says why do you not understand my
[1:29:25] speech even because he cannot hear my
[1:29:29] word if you are part of that Eternal
[1:29:33] Word why can't you respond to the
[1:29:36] father's
[1:29:38] voice he's asking them and verse
[1:29:42] 44 he classifies
[1:29:45] them he are of your
[1:29:50] father
[1:29:54] why and the L of your father you will
[1:30:01] do he was a murderer from the
[1:30:04] beginning and not in the
[1:30:09] truth not that he never knew the
[1:30:12] truth but he AB not in the
[1:30:17] truth that's a very great sign of being
[1:30:20] a child of God
[1:30:23] the wind will
[1:30:25] blow but election brings you
[1:30:28] back amen you say I will never go
[1:30:33] nowhere it's only the devil that does
[1:30:35] not abide in the
[1:30:38] truth because there's no truth in
[1:30:41] him and Truth is a person you
[1:30:45] remember amen when he speaketh a lie he
[1:30:49] speaketh of his own for he a
[1:30:53] liar and the father of
[1:30:55] it oh hallelujah hallelujah the church
[1:30:59] is open to
[1:31:01] all but God speaks to the je in the
[1:31:06] church they hear the word and the sight
[1:31:10] act upon the
[1:31:12] word amen so we are related to God by a
[1:31:17] spiritual Gene and this gen has the Char
[1:31:23] of God the likeness and
[1:31:27] image Hallelujah hallu so being a Son of
[1:31:31] God you are in
[1:31:36] nature praise the Lord then he defines
[1:31:40] his
[1:31:42] children sometimes he calls them
[1:31:45] Sons then he Calla them SE
[1:31:48] children according to First Peter 123
[1:31:52] then he call them a chosen
[1:31:54] generation a royal
[1:31:56] priesthood a holy
[1:31:59] nation A peculiar people a kingdom of
[1:32:03] priests all these kind of says a new
[1:32:07] creation hallelujah
[1:32:11] hallelujah you see we are not ordinary
[1:32:16] people that's why you are able to
[1:32:19] stand all the trials you through you are
[1:32:23] not an ordinary
[1:32:28] person
[1:32:30] Ephesians 4 verse
[1:32:35] 24 you are a new
[1:32:42] creation he says and that he put on the
[1:32:47] new
[1:32:50] man
[1:32:52] which after God is created in
[1:32:55] righteousness and true
[1:33:02] Holiness so this new
[1:33:05] creation is not an old creation
[1:33:11] [Music]
[1:33:14] made could not be called a new
[1:33:17] creation this is exactly what it says
[1:33:22] a new
[1:33:23] creation it is another
[1:33:27] creation hallelujah hallelujah in the
[1:33:30] same body you used to live in your human
[1:33:33] Spirit
[1:33:34] area and your
[1:33:37] manifestations evil
[1:33:43] wickedness malice but then when God
[1:33:47] comes then he quickens that Eternal seed
[1:33:51] Jes
[1:33:52] and you are totally different from what
[1:33:55] you used to be in New
[1:34:00] Creation he wants you to deal he wants
[1:34:03] to deal with
[1:34:05] you by the new
[1:34:08] man new because he's quickened purposely
[1:34:11] to hear from
[1:34:15] God Amen and then when he hears from God
[1:34:19] he causes the outer man to
[1:34:23] perform that's the righteousness the
[1:34:25] scripture speaking
[1:34:27] about so the new
[1:34:29] B changes the line of
[1:34:35] command amen is now
[1:34:39] God to the

[1:34:55] praise the Lord so at that time you are
[1:34:58] born
[1:34:59] again the Giant in
[1:35:02] you is
[1:35:04] awakened and the enemy
[1:35:07] Satan begins to set
[1:35:10] back a new
[1:35:14] creation oh hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:35:17] are under new
[1:35:20] headship when you that
[1:35:22] level then we can talk about being his
[1:35:28] bride because we share in his
[1:35:35] life we've got an
[1:35:38] instructor we've got a
[1:35:40] guide he says this is the
[1:35:43] way walk in it he's a Guiding
[1:35:48] Light Romans chapter 8 trying to look at
[1:35:52] where we
[1:35:54] finish you see I do the best I can so
[1:35:58] that we may know who we
[1:36:01] are amen we must know who we
[1:36:07] are not just a matter of coming to
[1:36:10] church but to know who we are in
[1:36:15] Christ amen Romans chapter 8 verse 14
[1:36:21] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:36:27] God they are the sons of
[1:36:31] God the children are SP
[1:36:36] L for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:36:41] bondage again to
[1:36:46] fear but you have received the spirit of
[1:36:50] adoption
[1:36:55] whereby we cry AB
[1:37:01] father hallelujah hallelujah you know
[1:37:04] you are
[1:37:05] born you know you are a
[1:37:07] child
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:10] everything
[1:37:12] father Heavenly
[1:37:15] Father you know you have a
[1:37:17] father you are born again you are a
[1:37:20] child of God you have not received the
[1:37:24] spirit of
[1:37:25] bondage but you have received the spirit
[1:37:27] of
[1:37:28] adoption so the spirit of our
[1:37:32] birth takes over our lives and helps us
[1:37:36] look back to the
[1:37:38] father where we came
[1:37:41] from Christ came to demonstrate that
[1:37:46] relationship Amen to
[1:37:50] demonstrate was born man but the life on
[1:37:54] the
[1:37:54] inside was godone he came to demonstrate
[1:37:58] that to demonstrate who you are he was
[1:38:03] man he was subject to all kinds of
[1:38:07] Temptations amen he suffered I mean
[1:38:12] trials like anybody would he was man but
[1:38:17] on the inside he was God he was a
[1:38:22] greater
[1:38:24] Fountain but you were a stream of that
[1:38:26] great
[1:38:27] Fountain do you understand what I mean
[1:38:30] the same power that was in Christ making
[1:38:34] him the Son of God is the same on the
[1:38:37] side of you making a Son of
[1:38:40] God he came to demonstrate
[1:38:43] that he says now you
[1:38:46] people you do not know who you are you
[1:38:50] want to show who I am because what I am
[1:38:54] you must be it takes John it Peter he
[1:38:59] takes James takes them up on the
[1:39:01] mountain he takes
[1:39:06] away the C of time John Peter and James
[1:39:11] were able to see the Fountain of Life
[1:39:15] himself hallelujah
[1:39:19] hallelujah that's what we are
[1:39:22] and that's what you are this morning you
[1:39:24] are sons of God by that kind of life
[1:39:28] that was demonstrated on the
[1:39:31] Mount of
[1:39:34] transformation that's who you
[1:39:37] are don't get
[1:39:40] blinded by this which can be
[1:39:43] tempted and sometimes you
[1:39:45] fall but the reason why you fall is
[1:39:49] because you were standing
[1:39:51] I told you here the devil doesn't
[1:39:55] fall he doesn't fall what is he falling
[1:40:01] from it's only the sons of
[1:40:05] God but God

[1:40:51] oh don't stand on your own
[1:40:55] understanding you tell Satan there is
[1:40:59] something you can't touch on the side
[1:41:02] of praise God Amen and that's what you
[1:41:07] are so he came to restore us that
[1:41:11] spiritual
[1:41:14] kingship

[1:41:29] toward us his
[1:41:31] kingship his
[1:41:34] Spirit do you see where we are that's
[1:41:38] why the Holy Spirit does not come to
[1:41:41] anoint this man he goes down to the soul

[1:42:49] is
[1:42:51] so are
[1:42:52] we in this
[1:42:55] world but the devil doesn't
[1:42:58] know until he tries to touch
[1:43:01] you he says this man
