[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Did I hear you?
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; So, you are welcome to 2026.
[1:21:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:19] It's a joy for me to stand here
[1:21:24] and just to say we thank God for the new
[1:21:28] year.
[1:21:31] Each time we are entering a new year,
[1:21:36] we always have different needs
[1:21:40] and we always think that the incoming
[1:21:42] year is going to be a magic year.
[1:21:49] But one thing that you should do
[1:21:52] each time you come into his presence,
[1:21:55] just hold your need before him.
[1:22:00] He will meet you at that point.
[1:22:03] Amen. Amen. So we appreciate God
[1:22:07] that we are together again.
[1:22:10] Amen. Amen. and uh looking forward
[1:22:16] to the service next Sunday, God willing.
[1:22:20] I was telling the pastor,
[1:22:23] it's okay. You see, you preach
[1:22:28] and you come to a time
[1:22:30] and you want to be preached to.
[1:22:34] Are you are you together with me?
[1:22:36] Brother Steven knows
[1:22:39] that wherever he goes, they'll tell him
[1:22:42] to preach.
[1:22:44] And sometimes when our strength is gone
[1:22:50] and when we are not looking anywhere
[1:22:53] else but up,
[1:22:57] that's the time when they have to preach
[1:22:59] to us.
[1:23:02] Amen. Amen. So this is my time.
[1:23:06] Praise the Lord. So, um the seats here
[1:23:10] for the visiting ministers.
[1:23:14] So, if you are a minister in the back,
[1:23:17] be sure you are going to get one of
[1:23:19] these white chairs.
[1:23:23] Amen. Or if you are a visitor or
[1:23:25] anything,
[1:23:27] just look for the white chairs
[1:23:30] and the Lord will bless you in the
[1:23:32] service.
[1:23:34] Uh we've had services on Friday.
[1:23:38] We were in Cam and we were blessed
[1:23:42] and yesterday in brother Emmanuel's
[1:23:44] place.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; He was at brother Bachika's place
[1:23:52] and it was another blessing.
[1:23:55] But as the principle goes,
[1:23:59] he saves the best wine for the last.
[1:24:06] Amen. That's the principle. The best
[1:24:10] wine
[1:24:14] comes for last.
[1:24:17] Are you ready for the best wine?
[1:24:21] Amen. Amen. So our brother here
[1:24:25] I was saying is connected to us in
[1:24:27] multiple ways.
[1:24:31] Amen. Amen. you know that uh uh the
[1:24:34] church in Edin
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; was the strong mission
[1:24:41] foundation that birthed us into this
[1:24:44] message.
[1:24:50] Amen. Amen. We were believers for about
[1:24:53] eight years.
[1:24:55] But when we came into contact with
[1:24:58] brother Ed I mean brother Harold Brandt
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; it was a very big help for us.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; So brother Steven
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; comes from the church in Edmonton
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; and brother Harold
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; is the one who wedded him to his wife.
[1:25:23] Amen. Amen. again.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; He is a son
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; to brother Tim Doddim
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; who is a friend of ours for many years
[1:25:38] and brother Edmeister
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Hister
[1:25:48] is the pastor
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; and he has been here too.
[1:25:54] So we thank God for the waters from that
[1:25:59] well
[1:26:03] this morning. Let the thirsty drink.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Let the thirsty drink
[1:26:12] without money
[1:26:14] without price.
[1:26:16] Amen. Amen. Let the hungry feed.
[1:26:21] If you need more,
[1:26:23] you'll eat as much as you desire.
[1:26:28] And we shall also have baskets
[1:26:30] remaining.
[1:26:33] And we shall feed on those remaining
[1:26:35] baskets after we come.
[1:26:38] So we want to stand up
[1:26:41] and uh receive brother Steven
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; that he may come and speak to the
[1:26:49] purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:53] Amen. So you are welcome my brother.
[1:26:57] Take it over from where you are.
[1:27:02] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:27:05] Amen.
[1:27:13] God bless you saints.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; We want to bring you greetings from the
[1:27:21] saints in Canada.
[1:27:29] Those from the the church in Edmonton.
[1:27:34] Edmonton.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; They certainly send their love and
[1:27:38] greetings to you.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we are a part of you.
[1:27:46] Amen.
[1:27:51] And we've been uh over here for two
[1:27:54] weeks now
[1:27:58] enjoying your beautiful weather.
[1:28:06] We went up to Chisoro
[1:28:09] and it was about 14°
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; and it was it was very nice.
[1:28:23] It always seems to be a little warmer
[1:28:25] here,
[1:28:29] but we we thank God for his grace.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; He keeps us and gives us strength.
[1:28:39] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want I wonder if we could take
[1:28:43] our Bibles together.
[1:28:46] We certainly appreciate all the
[1:28:48] ministers that have come today.
[1:28:52] and all the singers that sang.
[1:28:57] I always enjoy your singing.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; And thank you for everyone in the
[1:29:03] congregation that is here this morning.
[1:29:09] If there wasn't any congregation,
[1:29:13] there wouldn't be a reason to have a
[1:29:14] service
[1:29:17] because the ministering of the word is
[1:29:20] for the perfecting of the saints.
[1:29:25] Amen. It's God gives it to you.
[1:29:31] Amen. Let's turn to the book of Romans,
[1:29:33] chapter 8.
[1:29:37] I want to speak on the revelation of
[1:29:39] sunship this morning
[1:29:46] and we're just going to read one verse
[1:29:48] there and then we're going to turn over
[1:29:49] to Hebrews.
[1:29:55] Romans 8 and verse 19. And it says, "For
[1:29:58] the earnest expectation of the creature
[1:30:01] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:30:04] sons of God.
[1:30:16] Let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11 if you
[1:30:18] would.
[1:30:23] And we'll just read verse four.
[1:30:28] By faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:30:31] excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which
[1:30:34] he obtained witness that he was
[1:30:37] righteous. God testifying of his gifts,
[1:30:40] and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
[1:31:04] Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[1:31:05] together.
[1:31:07] Precious heavenly father,
[1:31:10] we thank you Lord that you promised to
[1:31:12] be with us.
[1:31:15] As you said, where two or three are
[1:31:17] gathered in my name,
[1:31:20] there I am in the midst of them.
[1:31:24] But Lord, we don't want you to be
[1:31:26] unappreciated this morning,
[1:31:30] but we want you to have the preeminence.
[1:31:34] We want to give you the first place.
[1:31:38] We pray that you would guide us, Lord.
[1:31:42] Guide my thoughts, Lord Jesus.
[1:31:45] That I would speak the words that you
[1:31:47] want me to speak.
[1:31:50] And Lord, may you touch our hearing
[1:31:52] today.
[1:31:55] that we could hear with understanding.
[1:31:58] Bring the revelation of your word Lord.
[1:32:02] Blessed father we pray
[1:32:05] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:08] Amen.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You could have your seats.
[1:32:15] So this the scripture says the earnest
[1:32:17] expectation of the creature
[1:32:24] all it's speaking of all of creation
[1:32:29] everything that we see in the natural
[1:32:33] from from the earth
[1:32:35] and all of nature
[1:32:38] the animals
[1:32:40] right up to these mortal bodies.
[1:32:45] is in expectation
[1:32:48] looking towards something
[1:32:52] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:32:54] sons of God.
[1:32:57] The word manifestation means the
[1:33:00] revelation,
[1:33:04] the revealing,
[1:33:07] waiting for God to finish his work.
[1:33:12] be because all of creation knows
[1:33:17] that when the sons of God have come to
[1:33:19] their full redemption
[1:33:23] that all of creation will also be
[1:33:25] redeemed.
[1:33:28] So it is in expectation
[1:33:32] looking forward to the fulfillment of
[1:33:34] God's plan
[1:33:37] right from the beginning
[1:33:40] right from the fall
[1:33:43] it has been under expectation
[1:33:46] as Adam and Eve left the garden of Eden
[1:33:51] the Lord said
[1:33:54] to Eve
[1:33:55] said thy seed shall bruise the serpent's
[1:34:01] Right from that moment,
[1:34:04] that first word of God that went forth
[1:34:09] now was speaking of redemption,
[1:34:13] speaking of a coming son,
[1:34:16] speaking of the plan of God,
[1:34:20] revealing just a small portion of God's
[1:34:23] plan
[1:34:26] in all of creation. ation began to look
[1:34:28] for that fulfillment.
[1:34:34] Amen.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; So we find at the beginning
[1:34:40] we find Abel
[1:34:42] and and and he by faith he offered a
[1:34:47] more excellent sacrifice.
[1:34:52] God had quickened something to him.
[1:34:57] God had revealed something to him.
[1:35:01] It had become a reality.
[1:35:05] As he was searching for God
[1:35:08] and he was reaching out,
[1:35:11] God came and opened something to him
[1:35:16] and by faith and he offered that
[1:35:18] sacrifice.
[1:35:21] We can go back to the book of Genesis.
[1:35:25] And we can read in chapter 4 the story
[1:35:27] of Abel.
[1:35:32] In verse one, it says, "Adam knew Eve
[1:35:35] his wife, and she conceived and bear
[1:35:37] Cain and said, I've gotten a man from
[1:35:40] the Lord."
[1:35:53] And she again bare his brother Abel. And
[1:35:56] Abel was a keeper of the sheep, but Cain
[1:35:59] was a tiller of the ground.
[1:36:08] And in the process of time, it came to
[1:36:10] pass that Cain brought of the fruit of
[1:36:13] the ground an offering unto the Lord.
[1:36:22] And Abel he also brought of the
[1:36:23] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[1:36:25] thereof. And the Lord had respect unto
[1:36:28] Abel and to his offering.
[1:36:39] But unto Cain and to his offering he had
[1:36:42] not respect. And Cain was very wroth and
[1:36:45] his countenance fell.
[1:36:55] So, so
[1:36:58] here now is Cain and Abel.
[1:37:02] And brother Brandham says in questions
[1:37:03] and answers,
[1:37:06] he says, "If you notice, it's always
[1:37:08] been twins all along.
[1:37:13] There was Cain and Abel were twins.
[1:37:17] And Esau and Jacob were twins.
[1:37:21] And and Jesus and Judas come out of the
[1:37:23] same tribe
[1:37:26] and in the same church.
[1:37:29] Even the Holy Spirit and the Antichrist
[1:37:32] is to be twins.
[1:37:37] so close that it would deceive the very
[1:37:39] elected if it was possible.
[1:37:45] So here was Cain and Abel that now came
[1:37:48] forth
[1:37:51] and and Jesus tells us a parable.
[1:37:54] He said the ser went out to sew
[1:37:58] and he sowed good seed
[1:38:01] but an enemy came along and sowed tears.
[1:38:07] and and and the angel said, "Shall we re
[1:38:12] shall we pull up the tears?"
[1:38:17] But the Lord said, "No, let them grow
[1:38:19] together
[1:38:22] until the end time,
[1:38:25] and then the tears will be gathered and
[1:38:27] burned,
[1:38:30] and the wheat will be gathered into my
[1:38:32] garden.
[1:38:35] So he allows them to grow together,
[1:38:40] but but
[1:38:42] even though there's no word written
[1:38:46] about them,
[1:38:55] no Bible they could point to and say,
[1:38:58] "This is me
[1:39:01] and that's you.
[1:39:04] Yet that seed can only manifest its
[1:39:07] kind.
[1:39:11] And when the seed comes to its maturity
[1:39:15] and begins to bear its fruit,
[1:39:19] then we can see what it is.
[1:39:23] Amen.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; So they did not have the Bible back in
[1:39:26] Cain and Abel's day.
[1:39:30] That's right. They didn't grow up
[1:39:32] reading that Cain was of that wicked
[1:39:34] one.
[1:39:38] He had not yet manifested his fruit.
[1:39:44] There was no book of genealogies
[1:39:50] that said Abel was the son of Adam who
[1:39:52] was the son of God.
[1:39:58] But these were just two twins that were
[1:40:00] growing up together.
[1:40:05] And the Bible says in the process of
[1:40:07] time,
[1:40:11] they both came to bring an offering to
[1:40:13] God.
[1:40:16] They both felt assured that God would
[1:40:19] speak to them
[1:40:23] or whether or not they were assured,
[1:40:25] they had a desire that God would speak
[1:40:27] to them.
[1:40:32] They came to God for their different
[1:40:34] reasons.
[1:40:37] Cain came for for whatever his reason
[1:40:40] was.
[1:40:42] whatever he wanted from God.
[1:40:46] Abel came by revelation
[1:40:50] in the process of time.
[1:40:54] The Bible says by faith Abel offered the
[1:40:57] sacrifice.
[1:41:02] Faith doesn't come from nowhere.
[1:41:06] Faith comes from hearing the word.
[1:41:10] hearing the word of God.
[1:41:13] So Abel had been feeding on something.
[1:41:18] Abel had had been listening.
[1:41:22] Abel had been desiring
[1:41:26] and and and and here now these these
[1:41:29] boys were born
[1:41:33] and they begin to grow
[1:41:36] and and and they become young boys,
[1:41:40] not babies anymore.
[1:41:43] And they begin to look up to Adam
[1:41:47] as all sons do.
[1:41:53] Say, "Oh, there's my daddy.
[1:41:57] I want to be just like him.
[1:42:00] I want to be strong like him.
[1:42:03] I want to be handsome like him.
[1:42:07] I want to be smart like him.
[1:42:13] They're just boys
[1:42:15] with desires in their heart.
[1:42:18] And and as Adam and Eve would put them
[1:42:20] down to bed at night,
[1:42:24] they would probably say, "Daddy,
[1:42:27] tell us stories.
[1:42:29] We we we want you to tell us stories."
[1:42:33] Well, what kind of stories do you want
[1:42:35] to hear?
[1:42:37] Tell us what it was like in the Garden
[1:42:39] of Eden.
[1:42:42] I I hear you say to mom that it was
[1:42:45] different before.
[1:42:50] I hear you say to mom, "If only we could
[1:42:52] go back."
[1:42:56] What are you talking about?
[1:42:59] What do you want to go back to?
[1:43:03] Tell us about that place.
[1:43:06] You know, Adam would begin to tell them
[1:43:09] stories
[1:43:11] about how that God created the heavens
[1:43:13] and the earth.
[1:43:16] And God brought forth all the fish in
[1:43:19] the sea.
[1:43:21] And he brought forth all the birds in
[1:43:23] the air.
[1:43:25] And he brought forth all of the animals
[1:43:27] on the land.
[1:43:30] And and oh, he all of the the trees and
[1:43:34] and the flowers.
[1:43:37] And Adam would say there was a place
[1:43:41] where we used to live
[1:43:44] where God took every tree that was good
[1:43:46] for food,
[1:43:50] every tree that was pleasant to the eyes
[1:43:54] and he put them in one place
[1:43:58] that was called the garden of Eden.
[1:44:02] It was a paradise
[1:44:04] made by God.
[1:44:07] And he made it just for us
[1:44:11] so that we could enjoy it.
[1:44:14] So that we could live in this perfect
[1:44:15] place.
[1:44:17] It was so beautiful.
[1:44:19] It was such a wonderful place.
[1:44:22] And there as as God uh created me
[1:44:28] and put me in this garden,
[1:44:32] all of these animals that you see around
[1:44:34] us
[1:44:36] He began to bring them to me.
[1:44:40] And you you see that that sheep over
[1:44:42] there?
[1:44:44] He says, "Do you know why it was called
[1:44:46] a sheep?"
[1:44:48] Well, I don't know. The boys would say,
[1:44:52] "God must have called it that.
[1:44:55] No, God brought it to me."
[1:44:59] And and and God said, "What is that?"
[1:45:03] And I said, "That's a sheep.
[1:45:06] And God said, "That's a sheep."
[1:45:09] You see the the lion up there on the
[1:45:11] hill.
[1:45:13] And and you know why that's called a
[1:45:15] lion?
[1:45:17] Why is it called a lion?
[1:45:19] Because God brought that great cat to
[1:45:22] me.
[1:45:25] Said, "Adam, what is this?"
[1:45:27] I said, "That's a lion."
[1:45:30] God said, "That's a lion."
[1:45:33] My God did all of these things.
[1:45:38] How he loved us.
[1:45:41] How he created such a perfect world.
[1:45:46] The power of God was in that place.
[1:45:50] The power of the spoken word.
[1:45:53] My one time we were just resting there
[1:45:56] by the grass
[1:45:59] just enjoying the sunshine.
[1:46:02] The sun began to go down
[1:46:05] and it went behind the great the great
[1:46:08] pine tree
[1:46:11] and and it got a little bit of shade on
[1:46:14] us.
[1:46:17] And your mother said, "Adam, it's a
[1:46:19] little chilly."
[1:46:24] I said, "Tree,
[1:46:27] move over here.
[1:46:30] You're in the way.
[1:46:33] You're not in the right place."
[1:46:36] And it had to listen.
[1:46:39] It had to obey my voice.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, it was a wonderful place.
[1:46:49] Oh, he Adam would say, "Remember the
[1:46:51] other day
[1:46:53] as as we were out with the flock of
[1:46:56] sheep
[1:46:58] and and out came a lion from the bush
[1:47:02] and and it and it it it snuck up and we
[1:47:05] didn't see it coming."
[1:47:08] And my it it came and it pounced on that
[1:47:11] lamb.
[1:47:13] And before we could rescue it,
[1:47:16] it had killed that lamb,
[1:47:19] tore it apart.
[1:47:21] And all the sheep were scattered in
[1:47:23] fear,
[1:47:25] trying to find safety.
[1:47:29] And we were running trying to beat the
[1:47:31] lion.
[1:47:34] And how it took that lamb and destroyed
[1:47:36] it
[1:47:38] and ate it.
[1:47:43] ate it, ate the lamb,
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; re remember how how terrifying that was.
[1:48:01] Remember how big that lion was?
[1:48:05] Oh, I hope he doesn't come back again.
[1:48:09] Yeah. Adam would say, "But back in the
[1:48:11] garden,
[1:48:16] what about the garden?"
[1:48:19] Back in the garden, there was lions.
[1:48:24] Oh, there was lions there.
[1:48:27] Just as big as they are now.
[1:48:31] Yeah, ju just as big as they are now.
[1:48:34] Well, how did you protect the sheep?
[1:48:38] Oh, we didn't have to protect the sheep.
[1:48:42] That lion and the lamb were best of
[1:48:45] friends.
[1:48:49] They would feed together.
[1:48:52] They would go down to the stream and
[1:48:53] drink together.
[1:48:57] And when that lion would lay down to
[1:48:59] sleep,
[1:49:01] The lamb would just lay down by the
[1:49:03] light.
[1:49:06] There was no fear there.
[1:49:09] There was no death there.
[1:49:11] There was perfect joy there.
[1:49:14] There was perfect love. There
[1:49:17] was perfection.
[1:49:20] Nothing could die.
[1:49:22] None could hurt nor destroy.
[1:49:26] Oh is such a wonderful place.
[1:49:30] Oh, maybe maybe as the boys were growing
[1:49:34] and and and they'd been listening to
[1:49:36] these stories
[1:49:38] and and they're growing in maturity,
[1:49:41] their minds are beginning to think,
[1:49:44] maybe they would say, "Dad,
[1:49:47] if there was just one thing that you
[1:49:49] could have from that garden,
[1:49:54] if there was just one thing you could
[1:49:55] have back,
[1:49:59] What would you have back from that
[1:50:00] place?
[1:50:03] You talked about how your body was
[1:50:04] perfect back then.
[1:50:08] Would you take that perfect body?
[1:50:11] You talked about the lion and the lamb.
[1:50:15] Would it be to see them laid together
[1:50:16] once again?
[1:50:20] You talked about the power to move the
[1:50:22] trees.
[1:50:24] Would you would you want the power to
[1:50:26] move those trees again?
[1:50:30] If there was one thing that you could
[1:50:31] have back,
[1:50:34] what would you desire to have?
[1:50:38] Oh, Adam would say, if there was one
[1:50:41] thing,
[1:50:43] if there was only one thing
[1:50:46] there, there is one thing that I would
[1:50:48] love more than anything.
[1:50:52] Oh, they would say, what is it?
[1:50:55] What's your desire?
[1:50:57] Oh, he would say every day
[1:51:00] as the sun would begin to go down
[1:51:03] the cool of the evening,
[1:51:07] there would come a presence into the
[1:51:09] garden
[1:51:13] and I would turn to your mother.
[1:51:16] She would turn to me. I would say, "He's
[1:51:19] here.
[1:51:21] Do you feel that presence?
[1:51:23] He's here. He's come back again
[1:51:28] just as he said he would.
[1:51:31] It's the cool of the day once again.
[1:51:35] He's come down to fellowship with us.
[1:51:38] He's come down to express to us his
[1:51:41] love.
[1:51:43] He's come down to reveal himself to us.
[1:51:47] He's come down to share with us his
[1:51:49] word.
[1:51:52] Oh, how we would run to the feet of our
[1:51:54] heavenly father.
[1:51:57] I would love to sit in that presence.
[1:52:01] I would love to hear his voice.
[1:52:04] If there was one thing that I could have
[1:52:06] back,
[1:52:08] it's just the joy of sitting in his
[1:52:10] presence.
[1:52:13] the joy of fellowship with
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; when when he would call out in the cool
[1:52:21] of the evening,
[1:52:24] Adam, my son,
[1:52:27] where are you?
[1:52:29] Oh, we would come running,
[1:52:32] father, I'm here.
[1:52:35] I'm here, father.
[1:52:37] Oh, and he we would come to him.
[1:52:41] He would come to us and we would just
[1:52:43] sit and enjoy the meal of the evening.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; If there's one thing that I could go
[1:52:50] back to,
[1:52:53] I just want to be back in fellowship
[1:52:55] with
[1:52:59] Oh, they would say, "Why can't we go
[1:53:01] back?
[1:53:04] It sounds so wonderful.
[1:53:08] Why can't we hear his voice?
[1:53:11] Why can't we feel his presence?
[1:53:15] Oh, Adam would hang his head.
[1:53:18] So, one day there was sin that came into
[1:53:20] our lives.
[1:53:24] God said we could eat of all of the
[1:53:26] trees,
[1:53:28] but of that one tree we couldn't partake
[1:53:30] of.
[1:53:34] And then and one day there was a
[1:53:36] serpent.
[1:53:38] He was more subtle than every other
[1:53:40] beast.
[1:53:43] Oh, they would say that serpent.
[1:53:46] That one,
[1:53:48] how could he be more subtle?
[1:53:51] He hate him. He despised him.
[1:53:55] Oh, he wasn't always like that.
[1:53:59] God cursed him.
[1:54:02] God took his legs off of him,
[1:54:05] put him on his belly,
[1:54:08] told him he would have to go on his
[1:54:09] belly all the days of his life.
[1:54:14] But there was one time that he was more
[1:54:16] subtle than any beast in the earth.
[1:54:21] He was more subtle than that lion
[1:54:23] creeping up on the sheep.
[1:54:28] He was just like a man. do.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; And there one day he got anointed by the
[1:54:34] devil
[1:54:38] and he and he got your mother aside
[1:54:43] when we were separated from each other.
[1:54:47] Then he said, "Hath God said,
[1:54:51] oh yes, Eve said, we can eat of all of
[1:54:53] the trees,
[1:54:57] but not this tree."
[1:55:00] And and and that that that
[1:55:05] serpent
[1:55:07] beg your mother,
[1:55:12] causing her to eat of that tree.
[1:55:16] And she came back to me and I could tell
[1:55:19] something was different.
[1:55:22] I could tell something was wrong.
[1:55:26] Eve, what's going on?
[1:55:29] Oh, Adam, she said,
[1:55:32] "Come partake of this tree.
[1:55:36] It makes you wise.
[1:55:38] It makes you know good from evil."
[1:55:43] And all all I could think about
[1:55:46] was what God had said.
[1:55:50] Oh, and how wrong she had done.
[1:55:54] She had fallen into sin.
[1:55:57] But I haven't told you about how I met
[1:56:00] your mother.
[1:56:03] As every creature passed by,
[1:56:08] there was no creature that struck within
[1:56:11] my heart.
[1:56:14] every creature there was male and
[1:56:16] female.
[1:56:20] Even when that serpent came by,
[1:56:23] there was male and female,
[1:56:26] but there was nothing that spoke to me.
[1:56:30] And one day I fell into a deep sleep.
[1:56:34] God took a rib out of me
[1:56:38] and separated my spirit
[1:56:42] and put part of it in in that body
[1:56:47] and he breathed life into her
[1:56:50] and and he brought her to me
[1:56:53] and he woke me up and and he said,
[1:56:56] "Adam, what do you think of this woman?"
[1:57:00] And oh, there was something that spoke
[1:57:02] to me.
[1:57:04] I said this is flesh of my flesh.
[1:57:09] This is bone of my bone.
[1:57:13] Oh, when you find that one,
[1:57:16] you'll leave father and mother
[1:57:22] and cleave only to your wife.
[1:57:26] There's something about that connection
[1:57:30] that goes beyond the natural.
[1:57:34] And and when she fell into sin,
[1:57:38] all I could think about was losing her.
[1:57:42] All I could think about was being
[1:57:44] separated from.
[1:57:47] And even though I knew it was wrong,
[1:57:50] I had to partake.
[1:57:53] If she was going to die,
[1:57:55] I had to die with her.
[1:57:59] It was a reflection of God.
[1:58:03] as a reflection of the work of Christ
[1:58:07] that he would die for his bride.
[1:58:10] And Adam who was a son of God
[1:58:14] couldn't help but be a reflection of his
[1:58:16] heavenly father.
[1:58:21] And there we had partaken
[1:58:24] and we knew that we were naked
[1:58:28] and we began to make clothes for
[1:58:29] ourselves.
[1:58:31] Oh, we worked hard on those clothes.
[1:58:36] We worked hard making those clothes.
[1:58:40] We knew God was coming
[1:58:43] and and and and we were naked.
[1:58:47] And and we we had to cover ourselves.
[1:58:53] There was something inside of us.
[1:58:57] We need to cover ourselves.
[1:59:00] And so we worked hard.
[1:59:03] We did the best that we could.
[1:59:06] We only had hours before the end of the
[1:59:08] day.
[1:59:10] And we made the best clothes that we
[1:59:13] could make.
[1:59:17] But when his presence came down,
[1:59:21] we hid in the bushes.
[1:59:24] We said there there's no way we can come
[1:59:26] before God.
[1:59:29] fig leaves or no fig leaves,
[1:59:33] works or no works,
[1:59:36] we're not worthy to stand in his
[1:59:38] presence.
[1:59:41] We hid ourselves from him,
[1:59:47] Adam, where are you?
[1:59:49] But there was something within us that
[1:59:51] couldn't resist that call.
[1:59:56] Oh, you know what I'm talking about.
[2:00:00] It didn't matter how far from God's you
[2:00:02] were.
[2:00:05] There was something inside of you that
[2:00:06] could not resist his voice.
[2:00:11] You felt unworthy to be in his presence.
[2:00:15] You felt unworthy to even step in the
[2:00:17] doors of this world.
[2:00:20] But you couldn't resist it.
[2:00:24] There was a deep calling to the Lord.
[2:00:28] God was calling your name.
[2:00:32] Adam, where are you?
[2:00:35] No. Adam said, I couldn't resist that
[2:00:37] call.
[2:00:40] We came before God.
[2:00:42] Our hands hanging down,
[2:00:45] ashamed.
[2:00:47] God said, "Wait.
[2:00:50] I I I hear you coming."
[2:00:53] God knew what they had done.
[2:00:56] Brother Brandham says he he took two
[2:00:58] lambs
[2:01:00] and he and he and he he skinned them
[2:01:04] and and he took those skins
[2:01:07] and threw them in the bushes.
[2:01:10] Said, "Put these on
[2:01:13] and come before me.
[2:01:15] I can't stand to see you in that
[2:01:17] condition."
[2:01:21] Oh, we we knew that we were as good as
[2:01:23] dead.
[2:01:26] But God rich in mercy.
[2:01:30] God rich in his love.
[2:01:34] Oh, he never changed.
[2:01:37] He loved us from the beginning.
[2:01:41] And even when we were sinners,
[2:01:44] he slew a lamb in our place.
[2:01:49] covered our sins out of the lamb
[2:01:53] and we could come out and stand before
[2:01:55] God.
[2:01:59] But that that those lamb skkins
[2:02:03] though they could cover our sin.
[2:02:06] They couldn't take away our sins.
[2:02:10] And God said, "You cannot live in this
[2:02:12] garden anymore.
[2:02:15] You cannot stand in my presence.
[2:02:19] You must go out from the garden.
[2:02:23] There the angels took us out of the
[2:02:25] garden.
[2:02:27] And God has placed those cherubims to
[2:02:30] guard the entrance to the garden.
[2:02:35] That's why we can't go back there
[2:02:37] anymore.
[2:02:45] But in the process of time,
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; there was another son of God,
[2:02:53] a boy by the name of Abel
[2:02:56] that begin to come to his maturity.
[2:03:01] That seed within him was being
[2:03:03] manifested.
[2:03:06] Says something within him is burning.
[2:03:10] There must be a way back into
[2:03:12] fellowship.
[2:03:15] There must be a way to come into the
[2:03:17] presence of God.
[2:03:20] There must be a way that I can have that
[2:03:22] fellowship.
[2:03:28] Oh,
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; that's what burns in the heart of every
[2:03:30] son and daughter of God.
[2:03:33] Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; You come to him.
[2:03:38] You receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:03:40] Ghost,
[2:03:42] but you're not yet satisfied.
[2:03:46] There must be more.
[2:03:50] There must be a way back.
[2:03:53] This natural world doesn't satisfy what
[2:03:56] is inside of me.
[2:04:00] It's a hunger for more.
[2:04:05] All down through the ages,
[2:04:08] the sons of God have looked for the
[2:04:10] promise to be.
[2:04:13] Adam looked for a city whose builder and
[2:04:15] maker was God.
[2:04:20] He had heard God's voice.
[2:04:23] He had obeyed God's voice.
[2:04:26] He went to a land that God would show
[2:04:27] him.
[2:04:30] That didn't satisfy
[2:04:32] He looked for a city whose builder and
[2:04:34] maker was God.
[2:04:39] We're always in a hurry.
[2:04:43] But the Bible says in the process of
[2:04:45] time,
[2:04:49] at its appointed time,
[2:04:53] in God's appointed season,
[2:04:56] he fulfills his word.
[2:05:01] Brother Brandham says, he says, "Now
[2:05:03] when the brethren received the baptism
[2:05:05] of the Holy Ghost,
[2:05:08] they said, "This is the summit.
[2:05:12] This is all of it."
[2:05:15] But brethren, that's wrong.
[2:05:18] There is no summit to God's power.
[2:05:27] We move on and on and on.
[2:05:32] It's the unlimited resources of God.
[2:05:39] It's never been tapped yet.
[2:05:43] Blessings and powers
[2:05:46] that we know nothing about.
[2:05:53] When was he speaking about this?
[2:05:56] This is 1955.
[2:05:58] The seals of night have been opened.
[2:06:02] The revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:06:05] He says there's more.
[2:06:08] There's blessings and powers we don't
[2:06:10] know anything about.
[2:06:14] It's never been revealed to archangels.
[2:06:19] He says it's laying just ahead for it is
[2:06:22] his church that will believe
[2:06:28] for eye has not seen
[2:06:32] and ear has not heard
[2:06:35] neither has entered into the hearts of
[2:06:37] man
[2:06:40] what God has in store for them that are
[2:06:46] brother Brandham says
[2:06:48] So, let's move up and claim our rights.
[2:06:53] As God opens the gates
[2:06:57] and swings out the welcome mat,
[2:07:02] let's move on up into deeper depths
[2:07:07] and never colonize ourselves.
[2:07:12] Never organize ourselves
[2:07:15] to get to a place
[2:07:17] where we believe this and that's all.
[2:07:22] But let's believe this.
[2:07:25] Plus, how much more we can hear from
[2:07:27] God.
[2:07:31] Amen. He didn't know what was coming.
[2:07:35] He didn't know what God was doing with
[2:07:37] his ministry.
[2:07:40] He didn't know there was going to be a
[2:07:42] sounding of the seventh angel.
[2:07:46] But he knew there was something lying
[2:07:48] just ahead for the church.
[2:07:52] And he says, "As God opens the doors,
[2:07:55] let's move in.
[2:07:59] As God invites us in, let's come in.
[2:08:05] Don't be afraid of the word of God.
[2:08:09] If God makes it real to you,
[2:08:12] you claim it and move on in.
[2:08:17] Footsteps is possession.
[2:08:23] When they went into the promised land,
[2:08:26] God said, "I will drive the enemies out
[2:08:29] before you."
[2:08:33] But they had to take footsteps.
[2:08:37] They had to lay claim to it.
[2:08:41] Every obstacle they came up to,
[2:08:46] God was there to see them through it.
[2:08:50] And God is bringing you to the
[2:08:52] possession of your inheritance.
[2:08:57] In every step of the way,
[2:09:02] he is going to be there to guide you
[2:09:04] through it.
[2:09:08] So when he lights up a promise in his
[2:09:10] word,
[2:09:13] just stand on it and claim it as yours.
[2:09:18] Don't listen to what the devil says.
[2:09:21] Don't listen to the circumstances around
[2:09:23] you.
[2:09:28] But just hold to God's word
[2:09:33] by the faith that he has placed within
[2:09:35] you
[2:09:37] and watch him bring his promise to pass.
[2:09:42] Amen.
[2:09:44] A maturity must come.
[2:09:48] The revelation of the sons of God must
[2:09:50] come.
[2:09:53] It must be revealed what we are
[2:09:58] and who we are. And that's what he's
[2:10:01] coming this day to do.
[2:10:05] You just have to believe it.
[2:10:08] That's all that's left for you to do is
[2:10:10] to believe it.
[2:10:14] That's right.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; As many as are led by the spirit of God.
[2:10:21] They are the sons of God.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; You've not received the spirit of
[2:10:26] bondage again to fear.
[2:10:30] But you've received the spirit of
[2:10:32] adoption,
[2:10:35] whereby we cry, Aba, Father.
[2:10:39] Adoption is the finished work.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Adoption is where the son has the same
[2:10:45] authority as the father.
[2:10:51] He's saying the spirit of God is going
[2:10:53] to bring you to completion.
[2:10:57] He's going to finish the work.
[2:11:01] How do we know that we're children of
[2:11:03] God?
[2:11:05] Not because our mom says we're a child
[2:11:07] of God.
[2:11:09] Not because our dad says we're a child
[2:11:10] of God.
[2:11:12] Not because the pastor says we're a
[2:11:14] child of God.
[2:11:17] But the spirit itself beareth witness
[2:11:22] with our spirit
[2:11:24] that we are the children of God.
[2:11:28] And if children then heirs,
[2:11:32] heirs of God.
[2:11:34] joint hes with Christ.
[2:11:38] Amen.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; As many as are led by the spirit of God,
[2:11:43] they are the sons of God.
[2:11:46] Amen.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; So if his spirit is within you,
[2:11:51] then you can't help but manifest a son
[2:11:53] of God.
[2:11:59] Just like your children,
[2:12:02] they have the spirit of a human within
[2:12:04] them.
[2:12:07] They can't help but manifest who they
[2:12:09] are to be.
[2:12:14] When you have a baby,
[2:12:16] you don't have to worry.
[2:12:18] Say, "Is this one going to be a pig?
[2:12:22] Is this one going to be a dog?
[2:12:25] I wonder if this one will become a
[2:12:27] chicken.
[2:12:29] But no, you're not worried
[2:12:32] because the spirit within it must
[2:12:34] manifest itself.
[2:12:37] The life that is within it must come to
[2:12:39] its maturity.
[2:12:43] And you know that when it comes to
[2:12:44] maturity, it's going to be just like
[2:12:46] you.
[2:12:50] Those little boys and girls,
[2:12:53] they sit at your table,
[2:12:56] they look up to you,
[2:12:58] They say, "Oh, I want to be just like
[2:13:00] daddy,
[2:13:02] or I want to be just like mommy."
[2:13:05] There's a spirit within them that's
[2:13:06] bearing record.
[2:13:11] That's saying, "Aba, father.
[2:13:15] I've got to become that.
[2:13:18] That's my ambition in life."
[2:13:21] It doesn't do no good for a dog to have
[2:13:23] that ambition
[2:13:27] because it'll never be a human.
[2:13:30] Doesn't do no good for for a pig to have
[2:13:32] that ambition
[2:13:37] because it'll never become a human.
[2:13:40] But your children should have that
[2:13:42] ambition.
[2:13:45] Because it's it's their predestination
[2:13:48] to become a human.
[2:13:53] They were born to be a human
[2:13:56] and they've got to become a human.
[2:14:00] That's right. Amen.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; They listen to your stories.
[2:14:08] They listen to you. Maybe those of you
[2:14:10] that drive the bordas
[2:14:14] and they hear about about how fast you
[2:14:17] got home.
[2:14:21] And the close calls that you had,
[2:14:25] this one just about hit me.
[2:14:35] Oh, and I had to go around this big
[2:14:36] hole.
[2:14:39] I didn't see it, but I got around just
[2:14:41] in time.
[2:14:44] And they're just looking with their
[2:14:46] eyes.
[2:14:50] Oh,
[2:14:51] daddy. I want to drive a boat.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; I want to do that.
[2:14:58] I want to drive your car.
[2:15:01] Hallelujah.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; And you you just laugh.
[2:15:05] Say, "Ah, just eat your food, son."
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; And the boy might sit there and pout.
[2:15:14] Daddy doesn't love me.
[2:15:17] He won't let me drive his car.
[2:15:21] He won't let me drive his motorbike.
[2:15:26] But it's not because the father doesn't
[2:15:27] love him.
[2:15:30] The father knows that he's going to come
[2:15:32] to a place where he can do it.
[2:15:37] If he if he just eats his food,
[2:15:42] if he eats his food
[2:15:44] and does his lessons,
[2:15:47] He's going to come to a place where he
[2:15:49] can do what the father does.
[2:15:54] Amen. So he's not laughing because he's
[2:15:56] making fun of him,
[2:15:59] but he laughs because he's proud of him.
[2:16:05] He hears him crying, "Aba, father."
[2:16:09] And he says, "That's my boy.
[2:16:12] That's my son."
[2:16:15] Amen.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; I have two brother-in-laws,
[2:16:23] uh, two brothers of my wife
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; and they're twins
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; and they grew up on a farm
[2:16:35] and they had a a farm truck
[2:16:40] and and their father, he did a lot of
[2:16:43] work out of town.
[2:16:46] And one day he was out of town
[2:16:50] and and the neighbor came over
[2:16:53] and said to their mother said, "Oh, I I
[2:16:56] I see that your husband's come home."
[2:17:02] No. She said, "My husband's not home.
[2:17:06] He's still out working."
[2:17:10] Oh, they said,
[2:17:13] "We saw the farm truck going down the
[2:17:15] road the other day."
[2:17:21] And if and and come to find out
[2:17:25] that these two boys,
[2:17:28] they were about 8 years old,
[2:17:31] but they wanted to be just like their
[2:17:32] daddy.
[2:17:35] And one of them was standing up on the
[2:17:37] seat.
[2:17:41] holding the steering wheel and the gas
[2:17:46] and the other boy was on the floor
[2:17:50] and he's pushing the clutch and the gas
[2:17:52] pedal.
[2:18:00] They were in a lot of trouble when their
[2:18:02] daddy came home.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Because they weren't mature enough to be
[2:18:09] driving that truck.
[2:18:13] There was coming a time when they would
[2:18:14] be able to do it.
[2:18:19] But now was not the time.
[2:18:22] The Bible says, "Despise not the
[2:18:24] chastening of the Lord.
[2:18:29] nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.
[2:18:35] For whom the Lord loveth, he chases,
[2:18:40] brings the correction,
[2:18:43] teaches them,
[2:18:46] instructs them
[2:18:48] because he loves them and he wants you
[2:18:51] to come to maturity.
[2:18:55] Amen.
[2:18:56] That's right.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; The father knows what the children need.
[2:19:05] Amen.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8 verse 26.
[2:19:11] Amen.
[2:19:32] says, "Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth
[2:19:34] our infirmities, for we know not what we
[2:19:37] should pray for as we ought, but the
[2:19:39] Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[2:19:42] with groanings which cannot be uttered."
[2:19:45] Amen.
[2:19:59] He that searchth the hearts knoweth what
[2:20:02] is the mind of the spirit because he
[2:20:05] maketh intercession for the saints
[2:20:07] according to the will of God.
[2:20:14] Amen.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; So when you are born again,
[2:20:23] you now come into the will of God.
[2:20:28] God has a will for your life.
[2:20:31] God has a purpose for you.
[2:20:35] It's his desire that you would be just
[2:20:37] like him.
[2:20:41] That's why he gives you his spirit that
[2:20:43] cries abba father.
[2:20:48] So his spirit is making intercession
[2:20:50] according to his will.
[2:20:57] Amen. We say Lord I need this.
[2:21:01] Lord I need that.
[2:21:04] I need more money.
[2:21:07] I need a bigger house.
[2:21:11] I I need a better job.
[2:21:14] The spirit of God makes intercession for
[2:21:16] us
[2:21:19] not according to what we wanted
[2:21:23] but according to the will of God.
[2:21:28] Job went through his trial.
[2:21:31] Many times we go through trials like Job
[2:21:35] where we feel forsaken
[2:21:39] and we feel like we're on our sick bed
[2:21:43] and God is not hearing our prayer.
[2:21:47] But God had a will for Job.
[2:21:51] God had a revelation he was bringing to
[2:21:53] Job.
[2:21:55] And he's doing the same in your life.
[2:21:59] He's got more revelation to bring.
[2:22:03] He's got more faith to bring.
[2:22:07] So just hold to God's unchanging hand.
[2:22:13] He's making intercession for you
[2:22:16] according to the will of God.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:24] And we know that all things work
[2:22:27] together for good to them that love God,
[2:22:30] who are the called according to his
[2:22:33] purpose.
[2:22:37] Verse 28.
[2:22:50] For whom he did forno, he also did
[2:22:53] predestinate to be conformed to the
[2:22:56] image of his son, that he might be the
[2:22:59] firstborn among many brethren.
[2:23:14] So he didn't predestinate you to some
[2:23:17] position in this world
[2:23:22] in Satan's kingdoms.
[2:23:27] Though he might put you in certain
[2:23:28] positions
[2:23:32] in order to mold you in a certain way,
[2:23:35] he might give you certain things in this
[2:23:37] world.
[2:23:40] In order to mold you in a certain way,
[2:23:44] but his purpose and design
[2:23:48] is that you would be conformed to the
[2:23:50] image of his son.
[2:23:54] that Jesus Christ would be the firstborn
[2:23:57] among many brethren.
[2:24:03] So within the hearts of the sons and
[2:24:05] daughters of God,
[2:24:09] there is a desire
[2:24:12] to be in fellowship with God.
[2:24:16] That's right. There's something within
[2:24:18] you. There's a deep calling to the deep.
[2:24:24] And there's a deep that must respond
[2:24:30] as God calls your name.
[2:24:33] He's not finished after giving you the
[2:24:35] new birth.
[2:24:39] That's why you're still hungry.
[2:24:42] That's why you come for more.
[2:24:46] Because there's more to be had.
[2:24:51] Amen. That's right.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[2:24:58] And
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; there we find Abel,
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; that desire burning within his heart,
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; wanting to bring an offering that would
[2:25:08] bring God down.
[2:25:14] Amen.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; And by faith,
[2:25:17] he brought that lamb.
[2:25:20] He didn't figure it out.
[2:25:23] Faith doesn't come by figuring it out.
[2:25:28] But blessed are they that hunger and
[2:25:30] thirst after righteousness.
[2:25:35] For they shall be filled.
[2:25:39] Here he was hungering for God.
[2:25:44] And God begin to reveal himself to him.
[2:25:50] There was a lamb for my mother.
[2:25:55] I remember the story
[2:25:58] God coming down
[2:26:00] and throwing them those lamb skkins.
[2:26:06] There was a lamb for mother.
[2:26:09] There was a lamb for father.
[2:26:13] Surely there could be a lamb for me.
[2:26:18] something begin to answer back
[2:26:22] like brother Brandham speaks of
[2:26:25] brother Brandham says when it begins to
[2:26:27] come
[2:26:30] it's like 2 + 2 equals 4
[2:26:38] 2 + 2 = 4
[2:26:42] 2 + 2 = 4
[2:26:44] and it begins to feet together
[2:26:48] and and Abel, that revelation is coming.
[2:26:53] There can be a lamb for me.
[2:26:57] Oh, I am a sinner.
[2:27:00] I'm not worthy to come before God.
[2:27:03] But but God provided a lamb for them.
[2:27:08] Lord, I can't bring you nothing of
[2:27:10] myself.
[2:27:13] I can't bring you nothing of my works.
[2:27:16] But Lord, if you receive this lamb,
[2:27:21] let it cover my sins that I can come
[2:27:24] into fellowship.
[2:27:28] There God comes down
[2:27:31] cuz that's my son.
[2:27:34] That fruit begin to manifest itself.
[2:27:38] It manifested itself in Cain in a
[2:27:40] different way
[2:27:43] because it wasn't the same seed.
[2:27:47] It manifested in him in anger
[2:27:51] and in jealousy
[2:27:54] and in hatred
[2:27:56] and he slew his brother.
[2:27:59] But in Abel, it manifested a humility,
[2:28:05] a humility to the word,
[2:28:08] an obedience to the revelation of God.
[2:28:14] And God came down and received his
[2:28:17] offering.
[2:28:20] And God orchestrates events in your life
[2:28:27] because he's bringing you to the
[2:28:29] adoption of sons.
[2:28:34] Right from the apostles time,
[2:28:39] they said hope towards the end.
[2:28:44] They said all of creation is groaning
[2:28:47] and in travail together until now.
[2:28:54] Even we ourselves
[2:28:58] which have the first fruits of the
[2:28:59] spirit.
[2:29:02] We've got the new birth.
[2:29:04] But something is still groaning within
[2:29:06] us.
[2:29:09] Amen. Waiting for the adoption.
[2:29:13] The redemption of our bodies.
[2:29:17] Says there's something within us
[2:29:18] groaning.
[2:29:21] Peter says, "Hope to the end
[2:29:25] for the grace that is to come
[2:29:29] at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[2:29:33] John said, "Now we are the sons of God,
[2:29:38] but that does not yet appear what we
[2:29:40] shall be.
[2:29:43] But we know when we see him, we will be
[2:29:46] like him.
[2:29:49] For we shall see him as he is.
[2:29:54] And they knew that it was God's purpose
[2:29:56] to conform them to the same image.
[2:30:02] So they knew when Christ revealed all
[2:30:04] that sunship was
[2:30:09] that they would walk into the same thing
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; because it was God's purpose.
[2:30:23] what manner of love the father has
[2:30:25] bestowed upon us
[2:30:29] that we should be called the sons of
[2:30:30] god.
[2:30:33] Therefore the world knows us not
[2:30:40] because it knew him not.
[2:30:48] Then he goes on
[2:30:50] first John 3
[2:30:52] says, "Beloved, now we are the sons of
[2:30:54] God,
[2:30:57] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[2:31:00] be,
[2:31:02] but we know that when he shall appear,
[2:31:05] we shall be like him.
[2:31:08] We shall for we shall see him as he is.
[2:31:14] Every man that has this hope
[2:31:20] purifith himself
[2:31:24] even as he is puremen.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; There's a hope lying within us,
[2:31:34] a yearning.
[2:31:36] Amen.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; But hope that is seen is not hope
[2:31:40] anymore.
[2:31:44] When God reveals himself,
[2:31:48] just like he revealed himself to Abel,
[2:31:51] when God reveals Christ to the sons of
[2:31:54] God,
[2:31:57] now that hope can be turned to faith
[2:32:03] because now is the season.
[2:32:07] Jesus said, "At that day,
[2:32:10] you'll know that I am in the Father
[2:32:14] and that I am in you and you are in me."
[2:32:19] At that day, he said, "You'll know it."
[2:32:23] Brother Brandham said, "That day is this
[2:32:25] day.
[2:32:28] This day, this scripture is fulfilled.
[2:32:32] The days of the voice of the seventh
[2:32:34] angel
[2:32:38] when he began to sound.
[2:32:40] The mystery of God should be finished.
[2:32:46] All of those mysterious seals
[2:32:50] hiding the mystery of God.
[2:32:55] Brother Brandham says Christ is the
[2:32:57] mystery of God revealed.
[2:33:02] And now as he reveals his message,
[2:33:06] now you can take a hold of this message
[2:33:11] and trust that in this message
[2:33:15] is the grace that will bring you to
[2:33:17] adoption
[2:33:21] is the grace that will bring you to
[2:33:23] maturity.
[2:33:25] The grace that will finish the plan of
[2:33:27] God.
[2:33:30] A grace that will reveal the sons of
[2:33:33] God.
[2:33:36] That which all of creation has been
[2:33:39] groaning for.
[2:33:42] It is here.
[2:33:44] We just have to lay hold of it.
[2:33:48] We just have to walk in it as God gives
[2:33:51] us life.
[2:33:55] The seals have been open,
[2:33:58] but they've got to be open to you
[2:34:02] because it's a personal walk.
[2:34:06] Brother Brandham says, "When a man walks
[2:34:08] by perfect faith,
[2:34:11] he's shut in to a world with him and God
[2:34:14] alone,
[2:34:19] but the pastor's not in there with you.
[2:34:23] your mother and father not in their
[2:34:24] heart.
[2:34:27] But when God makes himself known to you,
[2:34:31] it's you and him alone
[2:34:34] in a secret place.
[2:34:37] In a hidden place,
[2:34:40] a place the world knows nothing about.
[2:34:44] A place where Christ reveals himself to
[2:34:48] where he opens his word personally.
[2:34:54] Brother Brandham said when those seals
[2:34:55] were open,
[2:34:58] he said the Bible became a new book to
[2:35:00] me.
[2:35:02] And you've got to let him open the seals
[2:35:04] to you.
[2:35:07] The Bible will become a new book to you
[2:35:12] cuz you'll see all that Christ was,
[2:35:16] all that Christ is.
[2:35:20] And you will see who you are
[2:35:24] because you must be conformed to that
[2:35:26] same image.
[2:35:30] Nothing lacking.
[2:35:38] Wow.
[2:35:40] Revelations chapter 5.
[2:35:49] All right.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; In John, in Revelations 4, John sees the
[2:35:57] throne of God
[2:36:02] and he describes it.
[2:36:06] And then in Revelations 5,
[2:36:10] he he looks a little deeper.
[2:36:14] says, "I saw in the right hand of him
[2:36:17] that sat on the throne a book written
[2:36:20] within and on the backside sealed with
[2:36:22] seven seals.
[2:36:38] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[2:36:41] with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to
[2:36:43] open the book and to loose the seals
[2:36:46] thereof?
[2:36:59] And no man in heaven, nor in earth,
[2:37:02] neither under the earth, was able to
[2:37:04] open the book, neither to look thereon.
[2:37:18] No man was worthy.
[2:37:22] Abel wasn't worthy.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; Abraham wasn't worthy.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; The father of the faith.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; Jacob wasn't worthy.
[2:37:37] His name had been changed to Israel.
[2:37:41] As a prince, thou has power with God.
[2:37:46] But he wasn't worthy.
[2:37:49] None of the prophets were worthy.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; Moses wasn't worthy
[2:37:57] who spoke lip to ear with God,
[2:38:02] but he wasn't worthy.
[2:38:05] John the Baptist wasn't worthy.
[2:38:09] Jesus said, "There's never been a man
[2:38:11] born of a woman greater than John.
[2:38:18] Maybe you thought, "Well, this is John's
[2:38:20] moment."
[2:38:23] The greatest one born of a woman.
[2:38:27] Where's John?
[2:38:30] Come on, John.
[2:38:32] Now's your moment. Now's your time. You
[2:38:36] take the book.
[2:38:38] But John said, "I'm not worthy to even
[2:38:40] loose the sheep.
[2:38:45] lamb that is coming
[2:38:49] and no one was worthy.
[2:38:52] And there John sees redemption in the
[2:38:54] hand of him that's on the throne.
[2:38:59] And without that redemption,
[2:39:02] if no one could take the book,
[2:39:06] all would be lost.
[2:39:10] John
[2:39:12] much,
[2:39:14] because no man was found worthy to open
[2:39:16] and read the book, neither to look
[2:39:18] thereon.
[2:39:27] John is weeping.
[2:39:29] He had the Holy Ghost
[2:39:32] and and and he he he he had he had seen
[2:39:36] the power of God.
[2:39:39] But but if if that book wasn't redeemed,
[2:39:45] that which is he was groaning for
[2:39:49] could not come into manifestation.
[2:39:53] The work could not be completed.
[2:39:57] He had seen Christ standing in the midst
[2:39:59] of the church.
[2:40:02] He had seen the reward to the overcomer.
[2:40:07] That they would eat from the tree of
[2:40:09] life.
[2:40:12] That they would not be heard of the
[2:40:13] second death.
[2:40:16] That God would give them a new name.
[2:40:19] Give them power over the nations.
[2:40:23] A morning star
[2:40:26] clothed in white raignment,
[2:40:29] a pillar in the temple of God
[2:40:34] to sit with him in his throne.
[2:40:38] But all of it is lost
[2:40:41] because no one's worthy to take the
[2:40:43] book.
[2:40:46] He says, "Oh, I've seen what Christ did
[2:40:48] for us.
[2:40:51] I've seen how he died on the tree.
[2:40:55] I've seen the veil was was rent.
[2:40:59] I've seen all of these things happened.
[2:41:02] He was the lamb of God.
[2:41:05] He rose again.
[2:41:08] Oh, surely
[2:41:11] somebody would be worthy to now do this
[2:41:13] part.
[2:41:16] Where's the one that will do this part?
[2:41:20] and he's crying,
[2:41:23] "No one's worthy
[2:41:26] is lost."
[2:41:28] But then one of the elders said, "Weep
[2:41:30] not, John,
[2:41:33] because the lion of the tribe of Judah
[2:41:36] has prevailed.
[2:41:40] He looks to see this lion.
[2:41:44] Where's this great lion?
[2:41:47] Where's this one?
[2:41:50] Oh, let me see this mighty one.
[2:41:54] And and behold, a lamb came from within
[2:41:57] the throne
[2:42:00] as it had been slain
[2:42:04] and takes a book out of heaven.
[2:42:08] And he says, "Every creature which is in
[2:42:10] heaven
[2:42:12] and on earth and under the earth such as
[2:42:16] are in the sea
[2:42:19] and all that are in them
[2:42:22] heard I saying, blessing
[2:42:26] and honor
[2:42:28] and glory
[2:42:30] and power be to him that siteth upon the
[2:42:33] throne
[2:42:36] and unto the lamb. him forever and ever.
[2:42:41] John said, "I see him there.
[2:42:44] He's the one that was on the cross.
[2:42:48] He's the one that was there.
[2:42:51] He's the one that saved us.
[2:42:55] He's the one that heals us.
[2:42:58] And his atonement has also paid for our
[2:43:00] redemption.
[2:43:05] Oh, he's paid for everything
[2:43:09] and he is worthy.
[2:43:12] Oh, and he rejoice.
[2:43:16] Now the work of God could be finished.
[2:43:20] And and now as we come to Revelations
[2:43:23] 10,
[2:43:25] when the mighty angel comes down with
[2:43:27] that open book
[2:43:31] and seven thunders utter their voices,
[2:43:36] John says, "Oh, I see it.
[2:43:41] I see the revealing.
[2:43:44] Let me write it." He said, "I was about
[2:43:47] to write."
[2:43:49] This is the message that needs to go to
[2:43:51] the church.
[2:43:53] This is what they need.
[2:43:56] This is going to bring faith for
[2:43:57] rapture.
[2:44:00] It's going to be faith to overcome all
[2:44:02] things.
[2:44:04] This is going to be faith to bring a
[2:44:06] body change.
[2:44:08] This is going to be faith to bring the
[2:44:10] resurrection of the saint.
[2:44:12] Let me bring this message to the church.
[2:44:16] But but he said, "No, John,
[2:44:20] don't write it. Seal it up."
[2:44:24] But in the days of the voice of the
[2:44:26] seven,
[2:44:29] when he begins to sound,
[2:44:32] the mystery of God will be finished
[2:44:36] as he's declared to his servants the
[2:44:40] day. I will break those seals.
[2:44:44] open that book that the church could
[2:44:47] know who she is.
[2:44:50] That sons of God could know what it
[2:44:52] means to be a son of God.
[2:44:57] They could see the completion of my plan
[2:45:03] and then they will be revealed to the
[2:45:05] world,
[2:45:08] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[2:45:13] That day is this day.
[2:45:17] Oh, let us walk in it, saints.
[2:45:21] We are come to Jesus, the mediator of
[2:45:24] the new covenant.
[2:45:29] That speaks better things than that of
[2:45:31] Abel.
[2:45:35] Brother Random says, "Abel was a
[2:45:37] righteous man.
[2:45:40] He died innocent
[2:45:42] because he was in the way.
[2:45:46] He was in the way standing for the real
[2:45:49] revelation that he had.
[2:45:54] He spoke. It cried out. The justice, the
[2:45:59] just blood of Abel cried out against
[2:46:02] Cain.
[2:46:06] But the blood of Jesus Christ not only
[2:46:08] cried out, it redeemed.
[2:46:14] It speaks better things.
[2:46:19] It makes you sons and daughters.
[2:46:25] That's right.
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, wherefore gird up the loins of your
[2:46:29] mind, Peter said,
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; and be sober
[2:46:37] and hope to the end
[2:46:40] for for the grace that is to be brought
[2:46:42] unto you
[2:46:45] at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:46:50] as obedient children.
[2:46:54] Not fashioning yourselves
[2:46:56] according to the former lust in your
[2:46:59] ignorance.
[2:47:04] &gt;&gt; That capstone came down with cryings of
[2:47:07] grace. Grace.
[2:47:14] Brother Brandham says
[2:47:16] he says when he started to write those
[2:47:18] seven thunders
[2:47:21] he said don't write it
[2:47:24] he had been commissioned to write
[2:47:25] everything he seen
[2:47:29] but when those seven thunders in
[2:47:31] revelations 10 uttered
[2:47:36] he said don't write them at all
[2:47:39] they are mysteries
[2:47:42] we don't know what they are Yet
[2:47:45] this is the first seal.
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "And when it do,
[2:47:52] it'll give faith
[2:47:56] for that rapturing grace
[2:48:01] for that church to move out."
[2:48:08] Amen. So we are sitting around the table
[2:48:12] of the Lord
[2:48:16] &gt;&gt; and he is saying just eat your food.
[2:48:25] There's something within you crying abba
[2:48:27] father
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; and he's saying just eat what I put
[2:48:34] before you
[2:48:38] will manifest who you are.
[2:48:42] &gt;&gt; You were in my thoughts before the
[2:48:43] foundation of the world.
[2:48:48] my spirit to quicken that seed within
[2:48:50] you
[2:48:54] and it must bring forth of its kind.
[2:48:59] Just eat the food that I put before you.
[2:49:04] As many as received him,
[2:49:09] to them gave he power to become the sons
[2:49:12] of God,
[2:49:16] even to them that believe on his name.
[2:49:19] which are born not of blood,
[2:49:22] nor of the will of the flesh,
[2:49:25] nor of the will of man,
[2:49:28] but of God.
[2:49:32] He gave you the power to become the sons
[2:49:35] of God.
[2:49:38] It wasn't an instant transformation,
[2:49:44] but the power is within you to do it.
[2:49:49] line upon line,
[2:49:53] precept upon precept,
[2:49:56] here a little and there a little.
[2:50:01] Brother Brandham says, "Now out of every
[2:50:03] kindred,
[2:50:07] tribe and nation,
[2:50:12] he he has purposed a new creation.
[2:50:18] He was the first of that creation.
[2:50:23] He was God created in the form of man.
[2:50:29] Now by his spirit,
[2:50:32] he's creating many sons unto himself.
[2:50:39] God the creator
[2:50:42] creating himself a part of his creation.
[2:50:46] This is the true revelation of God.
[2:50:51] This was his purpose.
[2:50:54] This purpose took form through election
[2:51:02] this morning
[2:51:04] today. You you might not have faith for
[2:51:08] a body change,
[2:51:12] but God is bringing you there.
[2:51:17] Bible says from faith unto faith.
[2:51:24] Today you don't need a body change.
[2:51:28] Today you need faith for the trial God
[2:51:30] has put you in today.
[2:51:36] So just walk into what God puts before
[2:51:40] you.
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing the word.
[2:51:48] If you need healing today,
[2:51:51] you aren't going to be able to work up a
[2:51:53] healing within yourself.
[2:52:07] But there's promises in the word of God.
[2:52:12] &gt;&gt; And you look to the word.
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, make this promise real
[2:52:19] in my life.
[2:52:24] Make this promise a reality to me.
[2:52:29] and you walk towards that.
[2:52:34] Come to church expecting to hear from.
[2:52:40] Lord, you know my need
[2:52:43] because you put me in this trial.
[2:52:48] You predestinated my life.
[2:52:52] You're bringing me through this walk.
[2:52:56] And if you allowed this trial to come,
[2:53:01] it must be because you have the
[2:53:03] solution.
[2:53:07] So Lord, I am coming to you
[2:53:10] under expectation
[2:53:13] that you're going to bring the solution
[2:53:17] because it's not my faith,
[2:53:20] but it's your faith.
[2:53:23] Brother Brandham said, "A believer
[2:53:26] is the faith of God that moves in us."
[2:53:31] We need God to quicken his word to us,
[2:53:35] line upon line,
[2:53:38] whatever you're facing today.
[2:53:41] Maybe maybe you have financial needs.
[2:53:45] May maybe you need deliverance,
[2:53:48] but you must walk in the word of God.
[2:53:53] saying, "Lord, this caught me by
[2:53:55] surprise.
[2:53:58] But this did not catch you by surprise.
[2:54:03] Lord, you know where the provision is.
[2:54:08] Give me the faith to walk in it."
[2:54:12] And when God drops the faith within your
[2:54:15] heart,
[2:54:18] then the all fear is gone.
[2:54:22] and and now you can walk
[2:54:26] knowing that God has provided it for
[2:54:29] you.
[2:54:31] You might not see it.
[2:54:33] You might not feel it. You might not
[2:54:36] hear it.
[2:54:38] You might not even smell it.
[2:54:41] But that doesn't matter.
[2:54:44] Because when faith is quickened,
[2:54:48] faith is the sixth sense.
[2:54:53] faith lays hold on something from beyond
[2:54:55] the veil.
[2:54:59] Faith has laid a hold of God.
[2:55:04] &gt;&gt; That nothing is impossible with God.
[2:55:09] That I can do all things through Christ
[2:55:11] who strengthens me.
[2:55:17] It's not by our might.
[2:55:20] It's not by our power,
[2:55:23] &gt;&gt; but it's by my spirit, sayeth the Lord,
[2:55:32] &gt;&gt; so give him the preeminence.
[2:55:36] Let him have his way.
[2:55:40] Don't be in a hurry,
[2:55:44] but just keep feeding on God's word.
[2:55:48] And in the process of time,
[2:55:53] in its season,
[2:55:55] God will bring you to revelation.
[2:55:59] And to revelation
[2:56:02] and to revelation
[2:56:04] to revelation
[2:56:06] until one day
[2:56:09] the saints will arise.
[2:56:13] It won't catch you by surprise
[2:56:16] because you'll be walking with the Lord.
[2:56:21] You're walking in a world with you and
[2:56:24] God alone.
[2:56:30] He's teaching you.
[2:56:32] He's instructing you.
[2:56:35] He's guiding you.
[2:56:38] &gt;&gt; So let's love him.
[2:56:40] &gt;&gt; Let's love him.
[2:56:43] And let's give him praise
[2:56:46] because he is worthy.
[2:56:48] Amen.
[2:56:52] Amen. Amen.
[2:56:54] You love the Lord.
[2:56:57] Why don't we stand together?
[2:57:02] Maybe you could just sing that song. I
[2:57:03] love him. I love him because he first
[2:57:07] loved me.
[2:57:10] You know that song?
[2:57:12] Amen. Amina.
[2:57:19] &gt;&gt; I
[2:57:21] love him.
[2:57:25] I
[2:57:28] love him.
[2:57:33] Because
[2:57:36] he first
[2:57:40] love
[2:57:41] me.
[2:57:44] Did he purchase your redemption
[2:57:47] and purchase
[2:57:51] just my
[2:57:54] salary?
[2:58:11] Just sing it one more time as your
[2:58:12] pastor comes.
[2:58:22] &gt;&gt; I
[2:58:26] love you.
[2:58:37] is
[2:58:49] my
[2:58:51] salvation.
[2:58:59] Oh
[2:59:01] calary
[2:59:07] tree gone from my heart now.
[2:59:10] Gone
[2:59:12] from my heart.
[2:59:17] My world
[2:59:22] is
[2:59:27] Now
[2:59:29] through the
[2:59:34] I see all
[2:59:50] my
[2:59:53] is bending
[2:59:56] Lord.
[2:59:59] How precious
[3:00:02] blood
[3:00:05] Jesus
[3:00:07] cleans
[3:00:14] no I love
[3:00:18] my
[3:00:22] love
[3:00:24] and love
[3:00:26] I
[3:00:30] love you
[3:00:33] make
[3:00:41] love
[3:00:43] me
[3:00:48] by
[3:00:50] just my
[3:00:54] Calvation.
[3:00:59] Oh
[3:01:01] cal.
[3:01:06] I love him. Again as we go to pray. I
[3:01:12] love him. We can raise up our hands to
[3:01:15] him.
[3:01:17] I
[3:01:20] love him.
[3:01:24] Because
[3:01:27] he
[3:01:29] found
[3:01:32] love
[3:01:34] me
[3:01:42] just my
[3:01:45] salvation.
[3:01:52] Oh
[3:01:54] come
[3:01:57] free
[3:01:59] strength. You can take time and talk to
[3:02:02] the Lord how the Lord has revealed you
[3:02:04] as his son.
[3:02:09] Father how we thank you Lord. How we
[3:02:12] give praise to your holy name. How we
