We're reading from verse 31 to verse 35. [Music] Praise the name of the Lord. And then the Bible says, "Our fathers did eat mana in the desert, as it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to eat. Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily I say unto you, Moses gave not that bread from heaven, but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. Then say to him, "Lord, ever more give us this bread. I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. May God sing of his word. I want to preach on the subject in verse 34. They told the Lord ever more this bread. So I want to talk about ever more give us this bread. Praise the name of our Lord. And you know ever more means that all the time. Praise the name of our Lord. All the time give us this bread. And then Jesus tells them I am the bread of life personal pronoun. I am the bread of life. And then when he tells them that I am the bread of life, then he introduces to them how they can partake of that I am the bread. So he says in verse 35, &gt;&gt; Jesus said unto them, &gt;&gt; I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me shall never hunger. And he that believeth on me shall never thirst. So he says he that cometh and cometh means that it's continuous. You know you are going to him all the time. You're not going to him only once. And then he says he that believeth so now when you come you need also to believe. Praise the name of our Lord. When you come, you also need to believe. And you know, so he says it has to be a continuous communion, you know, continuously, not only on Sunday when I'm at church, not only in the morning when I'm praying or reading my scriptures. But this is something that should be continuous that you know as I've started in the morning you know just seeking the Lord. &gt;&gt; So even through the course of the day you know I need to see that I'm seeking the Lord even through the week. &gt;&gt; Not only when I'm with the people who know me. So I do behave well because they know I'm a Christian. But even the people who don't know me, I should be in continuous fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ. So they were asking him even more give us this bread. And then Jesus identified himself &gt;&gt; as the bread as the living bread. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now the other bread that Moses gave them which was manner that they were referring to before the Lord was falling every day. They would wake up in the morning and then they find that the bread the mana is on the earth and then they were asking what is this? &gt;&gt; Oh, this is the bread and then they would collect as much as they wanted. Praise the name of the Lord. And then they would grind it. grinding it or make it into different kind of meals or cakes or what? Praise the name of our Lord. So, but then that bread would only last that day. They needed on a daily basis to receive bread for their life. Praise the name of that was for natural life. So Jesus tells them, "All your fathers are dead. But then the bread that I give is the bread of life, praise the name of our Lord." Now in the message the Philian church age, brother Brennham says, &gt;&gt; he says, "Take the example now of mana from heaven. God sent down angel bread from heaven for Israel. But that bread did not satisfy. It was only good for a day. Those who ate it were hungry again the next day. If it was left around, It became contaminated. But Jesus is the true bread where of man was just a type. And if a man eats of that bread that came down from heaven, he will never hunger again. He does not to come back again. The moment he partake, he had eternal life. Here indeed was reality. Praise the name of our Lord. So now Jesus is the true bread because bread is meant to give us life. But then the natural bread only give you natural life. Praise the name of like just in the scriptures. When we go to Psalms 104 [Music] and then verse 15, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "And wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengthens man's heart." Psalms 104 verse1 15. They become excited all the time laughing around. There is some form of gladness the wine or alcohol they have taken. Some of them drink to forget the problem they have. Now that's the natural part. And then he says when you get oil or vaseline and then you smear your face then your face shines it becomes attractive. And then he says but when you eat the bread the bread strengthens your heart. It strengthens. &gt;&gt; It gives strength to your heart. Now that is the natural bread. Now how about the spiritual bread? If the natural bread can give a man's heart strength, you make a decision now I can go and do this kind of work. Because you make decisions by your heart. I think let me walk this journey. Let me climb this mountain. Let me do this kind of task. All the decisions come from the heart. And the heart will decide that I'm not able to do that kind of job. I can't finish this task of the work today. And now when you eat you feel more strength and say let let us continue now. How about the spiritual bread? &gt;&gt; If we can receive the spiritual bread, how much will it give us strength to run this race? Praise the name of our Lord. The Jews were telling Jesus Christ, "ever more Lord, give us this bread." &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And our Lord Jesus Christ is that true bread that came from heaven. Praise the name of our Lord. And we need to see that we desire that true bread in our lives. Lord, give me of this bread that I may eat. Feed me more, Lord. Give me more. Because the Bible says when we go to Matthew chapter 4, &gt;&gt; Jesus was hungry. &gt;&gt; Satan told him, "You turn those stones into bread." And then Jesus told Satan, "Man shall not live by bread alone, &gt;&gt; but by every word. that comes out of the mouth of God and proceeding. In other words, continuously you must hear the word of God. The true bread of God is the one which can give you life and can keep you alive before God. Praise the name of our Lord. So now you can examine yourself. How often do you attend to the word of God? How often do you hear the word of God? How often do you read the word of God? How often do you meditate upon the word of God? And yet God told Joshua the book of law shall not depart from you, but meditate upon it day and night. &gt;&gt; That's what says in Joshua chapter one. Praise the name of our Lord. Joshua chapter one and then we can read from verse six. God. He says, "Be strong and of good courage, for unto these people shall you divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them. So God is giving Joshua a promise that you are the one going to make this people inherit the land. But that would not come anyhow. God was giving Joshua guidance. I will be able to do it. He said, "Be strong and of a good courage for you to divide the land to the people, you may be strong and of good courage." And then he tells him, "Only be strong and very courageous that you may observe to do according to all the law. So now the obedience of the law is the one that gave Joshua strength and courage. Praise the name of the Lord to do the will of God. Just as the natural food gives you natural strength, it gives your heart natural strength to resolve to do things. Praise the name of the Lord. Even the word of God gives us that spiritual strength to be able to do the will of God. Praise the name of the Lord. You cannot be able to do the will of God if you don't yield yourself to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So you need to learn that you need the word of God on a daily basis. You need to yield yourself to the word of God, obedient to the word of God. Like God was telling Joshua, Observe all the law which I commanded Moses and turn not from the right hand or to the left hand that you may prosper wherever you go. This book of the Lord shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate there in day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in the law. Then when you do that, then all your ways shall be prosperous and you shall be successful. See how the Lord defines success. See how the Lord defines to be prosperous. Take time in the word. Praise the name of our Lord. reading the word, hearing the word, meditate upon that word, obey that word, then he says you're going to be successful. You are going to be s, you know, you're going to do the will of the Lord. And that's what Jesus was saying. You don't live by bread alone, but by every word. So you need to desire to hear God. The Lord Jesus says when they told him, Lord, ever more give us this bread. Then he told them just come to me and when you come to me, believe me. So now coming and believing, you are receiving the bread of life. Praise the name of our Lord. It should not only be on Sunday when you in church or not only be this evening when we are in church but even tomorrow you know you desire Lord once more Lord I need ever more of your word and you know the Bible says that the word of God let us go and pick that from Psalms 19. Praise the name of our Lord. Psalms chapter 19 and then we pick this verse verse seven. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. It says the law of the Lord is perfect. What does it do when it is perfect? converts the soul. In other words, you are changed. So he says the law is perfect. It converts the soul. You want your soul to be converted. Praise the name of our Lord. Get to the word of God. Let the word of God take charge over your life. Take interest in the word of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. Are sleeping at this time. If you come to church, don't sleep. Stand up if you're sleeping. Praise the name of our Lord. So the Bible says the law of the Lord is perfect. So now it converts the soul. You know it converts, it changes the soul. And then he says, "The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. Praise the name of our Lord. The statutes of the Lord, you know, they rejoice the heart. The statutes of the Lord are right. Now, when you are receiving the bread, praise the name of the Lord. You're not going to be annoyed. There is an excitement when you are going to eat you know because maybe you have been waiting for some time but the true bread from heaven you know it rejoices the heart it converts the heart that's the true bread he says even more Lord &gt;&gt; give us this bread &gt;&gt; and right Now we are receiving that bread. Praise the name of our Lord. You should be in position to bring joy in your heart. He should be able to strengthen you. If you are discouraged in life, if you are frustrated in life, the bread from heaven gives you that joy, gives you that peace gives you, you know, that kind of, you know, blessing that the Lord gives you. Praise the name of our Lord. You need to desire that bread. And it's without money, without price. Praise the name of our Lord without money, without price. Praise the name of our Lord. And then he says, &gt;&gt; the commandment of the Lord is pure. The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. Stop sleeping. The commandment of the Lord is pure, &gt;&gt; enlightening the eyes. So you know when you hear the commandment of God, it enlightens the eye. In other words, you are able to look at things. You are able to make decisions. You are able to discern things. This is in the mind of God. Praise the name of our Lord. It enlightens your eye. And then the Bible says, "The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous all together. And then he says in summary, they are more to be desired. &gt;&gt; Verse 10. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Much more than fine gold. Like when you are moving on that road from through and then you reach the district of you get men and women and children all of them full of soil. They are going down to dig soils. Then they kind of save it. Others are washing it in water. Others are grinding it. What are they looking for? Gold. Now if those people looking for the natural gold can labor like that perishes, but then the Bible is telling us that the word of God is more to be desired than that gold. Now for them they are looking for unrefined gold. That's where they laboring which is having soil and everything because they are small pieces which they keep on receiving. You can imagine a whole ton of soy. You are only going to get something like 10 g. Yeah, that's the thing. And that rate there is good enough that soil has a lot of gold if it has only 10 g or 12 g in one t. Praise the name of our Lord. But people are looking for it. But then the Bible says even more desired than fine gold. Fine gold. You know fine God is the one which is ready to sell which has already been processed and they get 99.9%. That's how pure it is. But then the Bible says you desire the word of God more than that God. And then he says sweeter also than honey and honeycomb. Praise the name of our Lord. You just imagine how precious the word of God should be to us. So they said ever more Lord give us of this bread. Praise the name of our Lord. So that should always be our desire. You know when you desire the word of God, it rejoices your heart. It changes your thinking. &gt;&gt; The way you look at things also changes. If you have been bound in a particular situation, that situation you were delivered from it. Praise the name of our Lord. That's how the word of God should be to our lives. So we should take it serious that when the Lord gives us an opportunity when he's speaking to us when he told them I have this living bread when they desired Lord ever more give us this bread. Praise the name of our Lord. They were you know they are coming to the Lord Jesus Christ. they were coming for the natural bread. You know when Jesus had had made had broken bread and then he fed them then they said we need to go to his meetings because we are going to eat food and they wanted to force Jesus Christ to be their king. They wanted to force him to make him a king because as a king he would make free bread. So there's no need of laboring and going to buy as a king. He would heal them. So no need of troubling you know it was like the time of Moses. He would give protection to them. So now they kept on looking for the Lord. Let us go to John chapter 6. [Music] verse 15. Okay, let us start from verse 14. Then this those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king, he departed again into the mountain himself alone. [Music] So wherever they were hearing that Jesus is they would cross the sea. Now when they reach this place he's not there. Then they start wondering where is he? I saw him go to the mountain. Then they try to see where he goes. They took time looking for him and then they would go in different places trying to look for him wherever he went. So the Bible says &gt;&gt; in verse 19, &gt;&gt; so when they had rode about, okay, let us jump that and then verse 21, 22, the day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea, so that there was none other boat there, save the one which were in into his disciples were entered. And Jesus went not with the disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone. [Music] Verse number. [Music] Verse 24. When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, you know, they kept on looking for him everywhere. And then the Bible says, when they saw he was not there, neither his disciples, they took also shipping. and came to Capernaam seeking for Jesus. And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, "Rabbi, hey, when did you come here?" Praise the name of our Lord. But why were they looking for Jesus? Because they ate &gt;&gt; and they were full. &gt;&gt; And you know there are some of those churches, denominations you go to. When you go to preach, they will ask you what have you brought for us. They are somewhere used to being given. So brings them to the churches. Then those who are used to being being given books for going to school for those things but not really the life their life to be changed. So even this wanted to force Jesus to be the king because he was giving them free bread. They were tired of paying taxes. They were tired of going to the gardens. We better get this man as our king. And then the Bible says, "And when they had phone, he said, where how did you come here?" Then Jesus said to them, I say unto you, you seek me not because you saw the miracles. because you did eat of the loaves and were filled. So what is your intent of coming to God? Is it for denial of bread or you come to church because your father comes to church or your mother comes to church and you have not known the essence of coming to church as an individual. You are following your father's religion. You are following your mother's religion. you're following, you know, your your your your friend's religion. Why do you come before the Lord? &gt;&gt; This came because they were filled with bread. &gt;&gt; And then Jesus tells them, &gt;&gt; "Labor not for the meat which perishes." Verse 27, But for the meat which endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you, for him has God the Father sealed. Now when we go to our fields or when we go to work, you know, you are working to get food. But then he says, &gt;&gt; labor not for the things that perish. Now he says, "Labor for the meat that endures unto eternal life." Now let us look at this meat. Praise the name of the Lord. He says, "Labor not for the meat that perishes." That's where we spend most of our time, the whole day until God has no room in your program. He has no space. The way Jesus didn't have an in where he would be born from and many times we also congest our programs evening. You only think about God when you are too exhausted. You only think about God at last. When you are spending, when you are spending, you think about God last the the the old coins, the old notes, you know, those balances of maybe either something you've bought is what you say. Now this one belongs to the Lord. When you are exhausted, that's when you think about the Lord. A very bad attitude as these people were displaying. So now in John chapter 4, praise the name of our Lord. John chapter 4 and then verse 31. Now Jesus here had gone to the well. And then the disciples had gone to buy meat. And while they were away, Jesus was interacting with the woman at the well. And then he told her, "Go and bring your husband." And then she went to the city to give a testimony. Come and see this man. Isn't this the Messiah? So now when the disciples came and the food was ready, they tell Jesus in John 4:31, "In the meantime, while his disciples prayed him, saying, "Master, eat." But he said unto them, I have meat to eat and you know not of. Therefore said the disciples one to another has any man brought him out to eat. goes to the natural thing. But Jesus said unto them, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me and finish his work." That's the meat he's talking about. Doing the will of God. How often do you do the will of God in your life? You need to examine yourself. How often do I do the will of the Lord? How often do I seek to do the will of God? How often do I seek to do that which pleases the Lord? And doing the will of God, Jesus calls it meat because it involved him. It took all his mind. What takes your mind? What takes your time? What occupies you? There are people on the day. You know they came to the Lord. They will come to the Lord and say, "I've spoken in tongue. I've done great things." And then he said, "I don't know you. Go away from me, you workers of iniquity. Now he said he rejected them because they never did the will of God. So now we need to see that we seek the will of God for our lives. We need to see that we do the will of God. Because when you are doing the will of God, you are fulfilling his purpose. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message, let me pick it up here. It's in the church age book. The pagan church age. He says those in the bride do only his will. No one can make them do otherwise. They thus they have thus says the Lord or they keep still. They know that it has to be God in them doing the works, fulfilling his word. He did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry. So now he works in and through the bride. She knows that For it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do, but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time. Praise the name of our Lord. So he says the bride of Jesus Christ will always seek to do the will of God and that should always be our heart's desire. Lord I desire to do your will. As God reveals you his will do that. Praise the name of our Lord. And as you keep on doing, he keeps on bringing more, keeps on giving. But if you have rejected the food that has been given to you, if you have you're disobedient to the little, you know, how do you expect to be given much? If you're not faithful in the little, how do you expect much? So if we is going to give us more, let us rejoice with the little that is always giving us. Praise the name of our Lord. Just rejoice with that little he has given you. Take it serious in your life. Be obedient. Be like the other who was coming from Ethiopia. He was reading the scroll of Isaiah. And then he was wondering what it meant, but he was reading it aloud. He didn't know much what it meant. But God had to send Philillip. And then Philip revealed to him what it meant. He was faithful in the little that was given to him. given us. We need to be faithful to that which has been given to us. The Lord will keep on adding adding. This little that we have will create room for more. He keeps on giving you. He keeps on giving you. He keeps on supplying. Praise the name of the Lord. In the Simon church age, he says, "No true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge and adurance to the pure word of God. So now as the Lord makes the word known to us, the more we get to know the word of God is the more we are expected to be obedient to the word of God. Now the more you are obedient to the word of God and then you become stronger, you become healthier and then he keeps on revealing more to you. Praise the name of our Lord. So he says no true believer is any strong and spiritually healthy and alive. than his knowledge of and adurance to the pure word of God as said by mult of examples in the Old Testament. Organization was growing a pace confirming and augmenting the death of the membership. For the Holy Ghost leadership was disposed and the word was replaced by creeds, dogmas and man-made rituals. So it was death. So that's why we need to take interest in the word of God. As he gives us, let us receive it. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And we just say, Lord, ever more. What he gives us today, let us rejoice for that. Let us be obedient in that. Let us walk in the light of that. And he keeps on adding. Keeps on adding. keeps on adding. You know, it is just like, you know, you are walking a journey. The Bible says the word of God is a lamp to our feet. &gt;&gt; You need the lamp to see where you're putting the next step. Now, if you fail to take the next step, how are you going to reach the destination? you can't work out. So eat the same thing with food. You refuse to eat today. How are you going to reach tomorrow? But you need that daily bread. You need God to keep on adding to you, giving you more, giving you more as you keep on growing. Praise the name of the Lord. Then in this message, the church of Simmon says in the Ephesian age and in this age and in every age we contemplate, we will see that this is true. And in the last age, which is our age, we will find the blackout of the word. The complete apostasy ending in the great tribulation of them. ending in the great tribulation. If you are true seed, if you are a true seed, if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost, you will esteem his word above your necessary meat. and the young to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So he says if you are true seed and you have truly been baptized with the Holy Ghost, you desire the word of God above your daily food. Praise the name of our Lord. And you would yearn to live by every word that comes out of the mouth of God. Praise the name of our Lord. So that should always be your desire every day. Lord, you have revealed this to me. Let me be obedient to it. Praise the name of our Lord. So that's how you keep on receiving more from the Lord. It is a continuous communion. You keep on communing with him. Then he says, "This is my honest prayer for all of us. May we hear what the spirit is bringing from the word for us today. [Music] Praise the name of our Lord. So you need to see that you desire more of God. Praise the name of our Lord. And as you receive that word, praise the name of our Lord. It gives you strength. Praise the name of our Lord. It strengthens you. It encourages you. It helps you in need. and it keeps on multiplying. Praise the name of our Lord. Any seed that is true will always multiply. So you receive the word, you rejoice for that word like when he got that revelation and he said you are the son of the living God. Jesus said from now the door of heaven will be open to you and then the angels will be coming. You will see revelation upon revelation. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to desire more of God in our life. More of the Lord. Take time read your Bible. Take time read the message book. Take time. Be obedient to these things and then you'll see how these things will mold your life. How they will change your thinking, how they will help you overcome your weaknesses. You had the other weakness. You had the other weakness and they keep on changing you, washing you, changing your perspective of things. The Bible says it enlightens your eyes. It keeps on cutting things away from you. &gt;&gt; It sanctifies you. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. You are no longer desiring to go to the discourse. Even when you get, you know, those journals or those kind of magazines, you don't want to know what's going to happen over the weekend. What's going to be at this club? What's going to be here? You no longer take interest in those things. You have already been cut off from all those wicked things. You only need to say, Lord, I need more of you in my life. My desire is you to come down in my life. Praise the name of the Lord. That should be a genuine desire for each and everyone. When we at home, you desire more of God. When you at your place of work, desire more of God. When you're at school, desire more of God. That we can be in continuous communion with the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. Ever more. Give us this bread. And he has already given unto us. But what he has given to us, are we rejoicing over it? Praise the name of our Lord. Like the Bible says, &gt;&gt; when he was walking with Cleopass, their hearts were kind of like held back, you know. They couldn't rejoice. They were sorrowful until he opened their eyes. Praise the name of our Lord. Now we in the presence of God. We need the Lord to open our eyes. We need the Lord to open our hearts. We need the Lord to open our ears that we may be able to receive what he's giving us. Praise the name of our Lord. Always desire more of God in your life. Amen. May God bless you. Amen.
