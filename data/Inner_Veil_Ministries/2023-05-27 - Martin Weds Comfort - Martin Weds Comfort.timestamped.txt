[1:08:58] so God bless you everybody
[1:09:01] I want you to stand up
[1:09:05] and we go into the scripture reading
[1:09:09] and take a few minutes
[1:09:12] to put relevance to what we've been
[1:09:15] doing here now
[1:09:18] amen amen you see sometimes these
[1:09:21] weddings and marriages
[1:09:24] are reduced to functions and locations
[1:09:29] of entertainment
[1:09:35] which is very unfortunate
[1:09:38] so let's put relevance to what has been
[1:09:42] happening here today is
[1:09:45] amen amen so
[1:09:48] Ephesians chapter five
[1:09:52] I'm going to pick out one verse
[1:09:56] which is
[1:09:59] and he says this is a great mystery
[1:10:04] but I speak concerning Christ
[1:10:08] and the church
[1:10:12] Heavenly Father Guru we thank you for
[1:10:16] the next phase of this service
[1:10:20] I pray that you may use your word
[1:10:24] to speak to us
[1:10:26] in Jesus name amen
[1:10:30] so I attack
[1:10:32] and
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:43] a little Comfort new comfortable
[1:10:48] both of them are kids that have grown up
[1:10:50] before me
[1:10:54] um
[1:10:56] Brother Martin is my brother-in-law
[1:10:58] organized
[1:11:00] and then Comfort here comforting I
[1:11:05] wedded the father
[1:11:06] and then I dedicated the comfort
[1:11:11] and then I've wedded him to
[1:11:14] martini and again soon I'll be
[1:11:17] dedicating her twins
[1:11:21] [Applause]
[1:11:25] so this is a very big order
[1:11:28] money and I'm really excited for that
[1:11:31] yeah
[1:11:32] amen Amina so now we're Fusion is fine
[1:11:36] when you get time read it from verse 21.
[1:11:44] talks about the relationship between a
[1:11:48] husband and a wife
[1:11:53] now a man is the first one at the head
[1:11:59] because according to scripture
[1:12:02] the husband is the head of the family
[1:12:07] and God gives the man love
[1:12:11] but then he gives the woman
[1:12:15] unless the man has got the love
[1:12:21] are you together with me so it's very
[1:12:24] important
[1:12:25] because the Bible says that the man is
[1:12:29] the head of the family
[1:12:31] and now without understanding
[1:12:36] many people think
[1:12:38] that the scripture says that the man is
[1:12:43] the boss of the house
[1:12:45] it doesn't say that it says he is
[1:12:50] now we go back into the Book of Genesis
[1:12:54] and we see the creation of man
[1:12:57] when God created
[1:13:00] all these other animals
[1:13:08] but when it came to mind
[1:13:11] two phases
[1:13:14] all these animals were created in a
[1:13:19] flesh body yeah
[1:13:21] Yama they came a God was a goat and he
[1:13:25] got the ambition
[1:13:27] but when you study the scripture
[1:13:30] it's not the same foreign
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:14:21] foreign
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:53] [Music]
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:15:38] you must be prepared for what you are
[1:15:41] going on
[1:15:46] that we get into marriage
[1:15:49] simply because now Martin is very busy
[1:15:54] he works three jobs
[1:15:57] which he does of course so now he has no
[1:16:01] time to wash his grace
[1:16:03] and what happens
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:16:12] now when you marry on that order
[1:16:16] you are not marrying your wife
[1:16:26] when you marry on the order
[1:16:29] but a man must have children
[1:16:34] then you are just getting some kind of a
[1:16:37] factory to produce your children
[1:16:41] we really need to get back later into
[1:16:45] the way marriage was in Genesis
[1:16:48] now in Genesis
[1:16:51] if you can really take this together
[1:16:54] with them
[1:16:55] you'll see that before God
[1:16:59] allow Adam to become a husband
[1:17:03] he had to put him on a test yeah
[1:17:11] and walked before and he says that I
[1:17:15] want to see what you call those animals
[1:17:18] and the Bible says
[1:17:23] that was the name there
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:18:18] I mean uh foreign
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:35] but you will not have married the wife
[1:18:38] and one for the Bible definition
[1:18:43] and even a man as the Bible
[1:18:47] because when God created them
[1:18:50] it's not the Heights
[1:19:04] the character that had the ability to
[1:19:07] think like a god
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:12] which thinks like a God
[1:19:14] then leads and guides a family
[1:19:18] that's where we can say that he is
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:19] so that I can find where the water is
[1:20:23] he goes ahead of me
[1:20:26] he has got a voice
[1:20:28] that I need to listen to him because
[1:20:31] that voice is the voice of life
[1:20:34] that's why he says my sheep hear my
[1:20:38] voice
[1:20:53] leadership by example that Martin is
[1:20:57] going to exercise
[1:20:59] that is what makes the headship of a man
[1:21:03] because the head one of them does not
[1:21:07] lead by tormenting the body
[1:21:10] but the head becomes the mind to the
[1:21:13] body
[1:21:15] the head knows the time to go to tables
[1:21:19] the intelligence is
[1:21:22] not going to bully the body
[1:21:26] formula
[1:21:36] you see that's what marriage is oh for
[1:21:39] my naturality that's how God wanted it
[1:21:42] to be
[1:21:43] amen amen that a man doesn't speak into
[1:21:46] himself just looks at us Jesus his wife
[1:21:50] and then the wife says
[1:21:55] and it is exactly what he was
[1:22:01] very hard to believe
[1:22:06] is not common in the homes
[1:22:11] but once you become one body
[1:22:15] and you become one man there are certain
[1:22:18] things you are going to do
[1:22:20] and they are going to meet exactly the
[1:22:23] demand it happens
[1:22:25] amen amen so now the scriptures
[1:22:32] he says husbands
[1:22:35] love your wife
[1:22:39] if you fail in love
[1:22:43] you are not going to get submission
[1:22:45] prayed up we'll go on that one because
[1:22:48] the love of God
[1:22:50] is productive love
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:54] amen it's a productive
[1:22:58] you don't just say oh God loved us and
[1:23:02] therefore
[1:23:04] but for God so loved the world
[1:23:17] Martin Monty
[1:23:20] that's the love of God
[1:23:22] not keep going home
[1:23:25] and telling Comfort I love you
[1:23:30] that's not the love of God
[1:23:33] the love of God is to express what you
[1:23:37] feel it's two words yeah
[1:23:40] let the works
[1:23:43] every quarterback you will get it
[1:23:45] when you go back
[1:23:49] sometimes the moods are not easy
[1:23:53] the kids have been disturbing huh
[1:23:57] and you just take a chocolate
[1:23:59] chocolate
[1:24:05] everything will be fine
[1:24:07] for the next one week
[1:24:10] you see this is what I tell my friends
[1:24:14] sometimes
[1:24:16] and I always even speak to the
[1:24:19] politicians
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:23] that you see these people don't need
[1:24:26] your money my community
[1:24:29] they need your attention better than
[1:24:31] those are you that's all and the same
[1:24:34] with the wife
[1:24:37] your wife is not going to turn you down
[1:24:42] America
[1:24:50] I'm telling you the truth
[1:24:52] you'll find homes
[1:25:00] but inside those Mercedes benzes
[1:25:07] they are crying
[1:25:09] they are dying on the inside
[1:25:12] they've got very expensive dressing
[1:25:16] but they don't have the peace
[1:25:18] that marriage should produce
[1:25:23] you see Martin Martini you are the one
[1:25:28] who makes the marriage
[1:25:33] every morning
[1:25:36] you look for new tricks
[1:25:41] actually you've taken someone whose
[1:25:43] daughter
[1:25:46] would she really defeat you to keep her
[1:25:49] happy every morning as first we are
[1:25:53] talking about marriage just look for how
[1:25:56] you'll make her happy birthday that's
[1:25:59] all you need then you'll have the best
[1:26:02] food
[1:26:03] your kilos will be sorted out
[1:26:06] there
[1:26:11] she's also going to look for something
[1:26:14] new
[1:26:16] every morning
[1:26:19] because you make her happy
[1:26:25] [Music]
[1:26:42] you know
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:50] to the Heavenly relationship
[1:26:53] that Christ has with this church
[1:26:59] so the scripture in Ephesians 5.
[1:27:03] tells the husband laughs
[1:27:10] you are lucky you've married in a very
[1:27:12] good family
[1:27:19] these ladies are married to one man
[1:27:24] you got certain families where you think
[1:27:27] you have married all the men in the
[1:27:29] house
[1:27:35] but the Bible says
[1:27:44] foreign
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:05] she's not
[1:28:07] you know
[1:28:08] I mean
[1:28:10] she's not obligated to you
[1:28:14] um
[1:28:16] anyway she replied to me when she was
[1:28:19] walking
[1:28:20] you wanted that need for you is she your
[1:28:23] wife
[1:28:25] to your own husband
[1:28:29] and I have seen that
[1:28:34] brother James here
[1:28:37] is a very special man
[1:28:40] he became a father
[1:28:42] to that family
[1:28:44] after the father died
[1:28:48] at a younger age
[1:28:50] I traveled with him I want to finish
[1:28:55] and then we stayed in a house of a
[1:28:57] deacon of the church there
[1:29:00] he had just redesigned this church
[1:29:06] and then the man woke up and says I got
[1:29:10] a dream yeah
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:32] amen Amina
[1:29:52] [Applause]
[1:30:01] so that we can respect you for that
[1:30:06] and those of you who are here including
[1:30:09] the bridegroom here
[1:30:11] that way you're not sponsored by James
[1:30:14] to go to school
[1:30:20] give respect to what brother James did
[1:30:24] for us
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:27] and not all of them are here
[1:30:30] but he paid the fees for them
[1:30:33] God bless you brother Alex
[1:30:36] he doesn't want to be said who he is
[1:30:40] one of the greatest newsmen we have in
[1:30:43] the country
[1:30:48] they came like a boys
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:56] in the house
[1:30:59] speakers
[1:31:02] into very high levels of Education
[1:31:08] but that was only possible because he
[1:31:12] loved his wife
[1:31:16] if you didn't love her which she
[1:31:19] wouldn't have allowed that um
[1:31:23] the words we have the entirely now is
[1:31:26] failure on love
[1:31:29] if you love your wife
[1:31:34] everything is okay
[1:31:37] now put it
[1:31:39] there was a situation
[1:31:41] that you will go back home and study in
[1:31:44] the Book of Matthew chapter 22.
[1:31:48] from verse 25.
[1:31:53] there was a man you know the scribes
[1:31:59] with Christ by any Christian and you see
[1:32:02] they believed but for you to be a
[1:32:05] husband to a wife
[1:32:08] you must produce seed out of here
[1:32:15] but then they came and said the master
[1:32:21] there is a situation here that there is
[1:32:25] a woman
[1:32:26] who was married
[1:32:28] and then the husband died without C I
[1:32:32] ain't gonna come inside
[1:32:34] Guys Without sins
[1:32:42] whose wife shall she be
[1:32:48] I did that so that you may wake up to a
[1:32:50] point that I'm bringing
[1:32:53] Jesus answers
[1:32:57] Jesus
[1:33:00] in heaven there is no marriage we shall
[1:33:04] be like the angels of God
[1:33:07] do you hear that there is no marriage
[1:33:14] to you people who are married
[1:33:17] you are not going to make your marriage
[1:33:20] good in heaven
[1:33:22] you're married
[1:33:30] you see according to the scriptures
[1:33:33] there is going to come at times
[1:33:37] in the Book of Revelations
[1:33:40] when Jesus comes back yes to take what
[1:33:44] he calls the bride
[1:33:46] under the bride is the faithful Church
[1:33:55] in the same way
[1:33:58] that Martin is taking his wife
[1:34:01] comfortable
[1:34:02] so now the taking of the Saints
[1:34:09] is called the marriage of the Lamb of
[1:34:13] woman so this marriage which we exercise
[1:34:18] is a testimony that there is going to be
[1:34:21] a marriage
[1:34:23] will come for his church
[1:34:26] are you together with me so now listen

[1:35:34] what you've entered in you are really
[1:35:36] aware of it
[1:35:39] you're not the responsibilities of the
[1:35:41] world
[1:35:44] when Rebecca was going to be married
[1:35:47] in the Bible Bible was there to take her
[1:35:51] yesterday
[1:35:57] she said yes
[1:36:02] so
[1:36:04] both of you Adam had to be ready
[1:36:08] and the woman is ready
[1:36:12] you've entered something that you are
[1:36:14] you know very well
[1:36:16] she makes herself ready yet
[1:36:20] and what makes her ready
[1:36:25] looking back into the marriage of Christ
[1:36:29] and his church
[1:36:31] verse 8 says
[1:36:35] that should be arrayed in finally
[1:36:39] clean and white
[1:36:41] for the finally then
[1:36:43] is the works of righteousness
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:36:50] righteousness
[1:36:53] meaning that she is
[1:36:59] [Music]

[1:37:07] Marine character
[1:37:11] but then that love which marries the
[1:37:14] characters

[1:39:35] them through
[1:39:37] Matthew's roommate
[1:39:41] but unless you make the 50 gospel
[1:39:46] you will not have children
