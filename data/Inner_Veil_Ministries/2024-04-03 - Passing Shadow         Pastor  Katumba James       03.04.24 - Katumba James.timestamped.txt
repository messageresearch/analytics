[1:28] this amen let us go to First
[1:33] chonicles 1
[1:36] chonicles chapter
[1:44] 29 chapter 29 we're reading from verse 9
[1:48] to verse
[1:53] 18 the Bible
[1:56] says then the people rejoiced for that
[1:59] they offered willingly because with
[2:02] perfect heart they offered willingly to
[2:04] the Lord and David the king also
[2:06] rejoiced with great joy wherefore David
[2:09] blessed the Lord before all the
[2:11] congregation and David said blessed be
[2:14] thou Lord God of Israel Our Father
[2:16] forever and
[2:28] ever
[2:50] thine oh Lord is the greatness and the
[2:53] power and the glory and the Victory and
[2:56] the Majesty for all that in the heaven
[2:59] and and in the earth is thine thine is
[3:02] the kingdom oh Lord and thou art exalted
[3:05] head above
[3:11] [Music]
[3:28] all
[3:30] now therefore Our God we thank thee and
[3:33] praise thy glorious name but whom am I
[3:37] and what is my people that we should be
[3:40] able to offer so willingly after this s
[3:43] for all things come of thee and of thine
[3:47] own have we given
[3:58] thee
[4:09] verse
[4:24] [Music]
[4:27] 14 for we are stranger us before thee
[4:31] and sojourn us as were all our fathers
[4:35] our days on Earth are as a shadow and
[4:39] there is none abiding oh Lord Our God
[4:42] all this to that we have prepared to
[4:44] build the and house for thy Holy Name
[4:48] cometh of thine hand and is all thine
[4:58] own
[5:27] I know also my God that though triest
[5:29] heart and as pleasure in uprightness as
[5:33] for me in the uprightness of my heart
[5:36] have I willingly offered all these
[5:38] things and now have I seen with joy thy
[5:42] people which are present here to offer
[5:44] willingly unto thee Oh Lord God of
[5:47] Abraham Isaac and of Israel our fathers
[5:51] keep this forever in the imagination of
[5:53] the thoughts of the heart of thy people
[5:56] and prepare their heart unto thee
[6:28] is
[6:48] amen you may be
[6:52] seated I just want to take our text from
[6:55] verse
[6:58] 15
[7:00] which says for we are strangers before
[7:02] the and soin
[7:08] us as were all our
[7:13] fathers our days on Earth as a
[7:21] shadow and there is none
[7:26] abiding so I want to talk about the
[7:28] passing shadow
[7:37] praise the name of our Lord the passing
[7:41] Shadow and that's what the Bible is
[7:43] telling
[7:44] us that we are a passing
[7:50] Shadow when you try to follow
[7:54] backwards or when you want to know what
[7:58] happened then you start wondering is it
[8:01] true or it's not
[8:03] true because it's
[8:06] noral like the
[8:09] historians you know they talk about
[8:11] Napoleon
[8:13] Bon Alexander the
[8:18] Great if these things were not written
[8:20] we wouldn't know anything that those
[8:23] things but then when you read about
[8:26] nebar and then how the Bible says was a
[8:29] king of
[8:31] kings was such a great man and all those
[8:34] kind of
[8:35] things but now when you go to follow
[8:38] what he
[8:40] did or you to find out where was
[8:45] that you find that the place where
[8:47] babyon was is
[8:50] disolated you know there's nothing you
[8:53] can
[8:54] TR and then even the life he live or
[8:58] whatever things did you look at the
[9:01] Great
[9:02] temple that Solomon built So
[9:07] Glorious with a lot of gold and silver
[9:10] and
[9:12] everything and then he built this Temple
[9:15] for the
[9:16] Lord but then you see that the glory of
[9:20] that
[9:21] Temple even Solomon
[9:24] himself in his time he was such a wise
[9:28] man but now when you try to follow
[9:31] Solomon where do you find him there's no
[9:35] more the temple he
[9:37] built there the great many things he did
[9:41] maybe his
[9:43] Palace maybe the streets of
[9:46] gold they're not there they are all a
[9:50] passing
[9:52] Shadow and so we see that even our life
[9:55] here on
[9:56] Earth is a passing shadow
[10:01] it doesn't matter our
[10:04] achievement our
[10:07] recognition the awards that we can
[10:10] get the education which we can
[10:13] attain the
[10:15] fame you know maybe the riches we have
[10:19] or the wealth we have the knowledge we
[10:24] have the wisdom we
[10:26] have our good health and then maybe they
[10:30] said this one is the most healthy person
[10:32] in the
[10:34] world maybe the hor most honorable
[10:39] person oh glorious
[10:42] person oh
[10:44] power might strength there is a friend I
[10:49] had
[10:51] sometime when I was still working in
[10:54] to and for him he said he had never
[10:57] fallen
[10:58] sick very healthy
[11:01] man but it only took some small kind of
[11:06] sickness he was
[11:08] hospitalized and within one week the man
[11:11] died and I remember I went to the
[11:13] hospital to visit him said I've never
[11:16] fallen sick and he looked strong but
[11:20] he's in the hospital after some few days
[11:24] we that the man has
[11:26] died all these things are a passing sh
[11:32] so regardless of our achievements that
[11:34] we
[11:35] get they all vanish
[11:38] away it's like chasing
[11:41] wi so we see that a natural
[11:44] man is a passing
[11:46] Shadow passing through the Earth even
[11:50] whatever we do is All
[11:53] Temporary praise the name of our Lord
[11:56] It's All Temporary like now you look at
[11:59] that building I think it's
[12:00] around CH Road around the lake
[12:06] Victoria Hotel which hosted the queen
[12:08] when she was still when she was still I
[12:11] think a
[12:14] princess when you go to the place right
[12:17] now it's not attractive at all but yet
[12:20] was glorious in the
[12:23] 1950s very great place but now when you
[12:27] go to the place you find rats asleeping
[12:29] there maybe snakes are there different
[12:32] things it's not
[12:35] attractive it's not
[12:37] attractive passing
[12:39] Shadow and then you look at now the
[12:42] great queen of
[12:44] Britain you know the name she had the
[12:47] glory she had the
[12:51] Majesty you know the the things when you
[12:54] would get into her
[12:56] presence but she's no more so we see
[12:59] that all our life here on
[13:03] Earth the Bible says is like a
[13:07] shadow our days on Earth are as a
[13:12] shadow and the Bible says there is none
[13:18] abiding it doesn't regardless of how
[13:21] much you may try to
[13:23] say oh let me be careful let me do this
[13:28] there is a time that it will come to
[13:30] pass that you are
[13:33] noral whether it is great honor or great
[13:38] digity praise the name of our Lord it
[13:41] all passes
[13:43] away it all comes to an
[13:46] end it doesn't matter the status of a
[13:49] person it doesn't matter the possessions
[13:52] of a
[13:53] person it doesn't matter the
[13:55] achievements of a person they all pass
[13:58] away it's just a passing
[14:01] Shadow and that's why the Bible is
[14:03] telling us praise the name of our Lord
[14:06] that's why the Bible tells us we need to
[14:10] learn praise the name of our Lord to
[14:13] number our
[14:16] days can be honored by the
[14:19] Lord praise the name of our Lord now in
[14:22] Psalms 90
[14:26] ver9 the scripture says
[14:36] for all our days are passed away in thy
[14:39] wrath we spend our years as a tale that
[14:43] is
[14:53] told just as a
[14:56] tale it just becomes a story
[15:00] maybe somebody looks at some kind of
[15:03] stone
[15:05] somewhere when he goes there it's a
[15:12] tombstone and then he reads so and so
[15:16] born
[15:18] this died this then maybe they can put
[15:22] the
[15:23] recognition maybe the
[15:25] best maybe they did
[15:27] this it's it's just a
[15:31] story no more there that's what the
[15:34] Bible is telling us all our
[15:38] years you know they are just like a tale
[15:42] that is
[15:44] told just tell in other words somebody
[15:46] may not take much interest in
[15:50] it why do you tell me about that what
[15:53] concern it's no
[15:56] more praise the name of our Lord so
[15:59] now but one thing that the Lord wants us
[16:03] to
[16:04] do is that when we are put here on
[16:08] Earth we shouldn't look at the things of
[16:11] this
[16:13] world much as we are going through this
[16:16] world and this world and everything
[16:19] vanishes
[16:21] away but during this time God is
[16:24] establishing his
[16:27] kingdom and it is very very important
[16:29] for us that we are part of the
[16:32] Kingdom the kingdom of God that shall
[16:36] live forever and that should be the main
[16:39] thing here on
[16:40] us that while we are passing on Earth as
[16:43] a
[16:46] shadow but one thing we have to be
[16:49] certain we are part of the Kingdom that
[16:52] being
[16:53] establish praise the name of our Lord we
[16:55] are part of that Eternal
[16:57] Kingdom
[16:59] that is being
[17:01] established because the Bible says all
[17:04] the kingdoms of this
[17:06] world are going to
[17:09] perish they are going to vanish it
[17:12] doesn't matter how strong the kingdom is
[17:15] it doesn't matter how powerful the
[17:17] kingdom
[17:18] is it doesn't matter how recognized the
[17:21] kingdom
[17:22] is all they are going to pass
[17:25] away like right now when we look at the
[17:28] kingdoms of the
[17:30] when we look at America every country
[17:33] wants be like United States
[17:36] ofer so powerful in everything powerful
[17:39] in
[17:41] ammunition they are powerful in
[17:43] technology they have the richest people
[17:45] in the world they have the best
[17:48] infrastructure in the
[17:49] world everything is almost the
[17:53] best everything is the best
[17:56] there powerful Kingdom
[17:59] but according to the prophet of our
[18:02] day America is going to be
[18:05] burned and it will be the end of that
[18:08] Kingdom you know brother Bram in
[18:11] 1933 all the land of
[18:15] America just burning
[18:19] de everything to
[18:22] ashes the people there the
[18:25] infrastructure there the technology
[18:27] there of them burning
[18:31] to praise the name of our Lord and the
[18:33] Bible says there is no continuing City
[18:37] here on
[18:39] Earth but we are seeking a city whose
[18:43] Builder and maker is God we are seeking
[18:47] a continuing
[18:48] City whose foundations are built by
[18:52] God we are seeking for that city that is
[18:56] built on
[18:57] righteousness that built on a purpose of
[19:00] living
[19:02] eternally not the cities of this world
[19:05] because the more the city of this world
[19:09] develop the more wicked they
[19:11] become praise the name of the more evil
[19:15] they become the more immoral they
[19:19] become praise the name of our Lord like
[19:22] now you see a place is having good
[19:26] neighborhood but then when they put
[19:28] there a
[19:30] bar then you see all forms of immorality
[19:34] there prostitutions there drunkness
[19:38] there King one another
[19:41] there completely set up
[19:45] change praise the name of our Lord like
[19:48] now when you move like on this road
[19:50] going to
[19:52] cam there's a place there around
[19:56] Randa they put there something like
[19:59] either or
[20:02] what and then I remember when we were
[20:04] having the overnight last
[20:06] week and then moving along there on Good
[20:11] Friday got there a lot of
[20:15] wickedness but the neighborhood was
[20:17] before better than what it is
[20:20] now and then there's also another place
[20:23] as you are turning getting to Tak and
[20:27] then also that place but those places
[20:29] were better than
[20:30] that but they put
[20:33] buildings and then they use those
[20:35] buildings for
[20:37] immoral and it brings destruction at the
[20:40] end of the
[20:41] day praise the name of our Lord now in
[20:44] the Book of
[20:46] Daniel Daniel chapter
[20:48] [Music]
[20:54] 2 and then verse
[20:57] 44
[20:59] he says and in the days of these Kings
[21:02] shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom
[21:06] which shall never be destroyed and the
[21:09] kingdom shall not be left to the other
[21:11] people but it shall break in pieces and
[21:15] consume all these kingdoms and shall
[21:18] stand
[21:27] forever
[21:45] for as much as th the stone was cut out
[21:48] of the mountain without hands and that
[21:51] it break in pieces the iron the brass
[21:55] the clay the silver and the gold the
[21:58] great God has made known to the king
[22:01] what shall come to pass Hereafter and
[22:04] the dream is certain and interpretation
[22:27] thereof
[22:37] praise the name of the Lord so he says
[22:39] all these
[22:40] kingdoms are all going to be
[22:44] destroyed praise the name of our when
[22:46] the Lord Jesus comes the third
[22:49] time in Revelations chapter 19 that's
[22:53] when he takes over all the
[22:56] Earth you know and everything Kingdom of
[23:00] us will be
[23:02] destroyed and then Christ will become
[23:04] the King of
[23:06] Kings to get into the millennial
[23:09] R praise the name of our Lord so now the
[23:12] Bible is telling us that in the days of
[23:15] these kingdoms of this
[23:16] world even now Christ is establishing
[23:21] his
[23:22] kingdom and is's establishing it under
[23:26] righteousness so much as we are living
[23:29] in these
[23:30] bodies much as we are living in the
[23:32] passing
[23:34] Shadow out of Us Praise the name of our
[23:38] Lord God is establishing an
[23:41] eternal praise the name of our Lord and
[23:43] that should always encourage us every
[23:45] other
[23:46] day seeking the kingdom of God seeking
[23:50] the righteousness of God everything that
[23:54] we
[23:55] do like now when we can go back and
[23:58] maybe we are going to follow
[24:00] up you know maybe the days of Adam the
[24:04] days of you
[24:06] know no and all those people through you
[24:10] may not find whatever thing they did on
[24:13] Earth you may not find what they did
[24:15] here on
[24:16] us but now for them when they were here
[24:19] on
[24:20] us they became a cloud of
[24:25] witnesses people who lived by the grace
[24:27] of God
[24:30] being obedient to the word of God should
[24:33] also be our desire to be part of the
[24:36] cloud of
[24:37] witnesses part of the kingdom of God
[24:41] part of the redeemed of the Lord that
[24:43] regardless of the days they were living
[24:46] in they were also
[24:48] evil they were having challenges in
[24:50] their
[24:51] times yet they overcame in
[24:54] their even us now in the midst of all
[24:58] the wickedness we see in the midst of
[25:01] all the evil that we see we need to live
[25:05] upright and overcome also in our
[25:08] generation praise the name of our Lord
[25:10] because it is at this
[25:12] time that God is making a bride for
[25:16] Jesus
[25:17] Christ it is at this time that God wants
[25:20] to get a Perfect
[25:23] Bride a church without Sports a church
[25:27] without wrinkles a church without any
[25:30] blemish praise the name of our Lord and
[25:33] God has given us the blood of Jesus
[25:36] Christ by which we can overcome every
[25:39] kind
[25:40] of praise the name of our Lord we have
[25:43] the blood the cloud of witnesses in
[25:46] Hebrews chapter
[25:48] 11 they had the blood of
[25:51] animals so we have a greater
[25:54] witness than those people in the Old
[25:57] Testament depending upon themselves but
[26:00] then here we are depending upon God to
[26:03] give us the grace to overcome every day
[26:06] that we
[26:07] live praise the name of our Lord we have
[26:10] a great cloud of
[26:12] witness praise the name of our so as we
[26:15] are going through this passing
[26:18] Shadow praise the name of our Lord when
[26:21] we go to Hebrews
[26:25] 12 and then verse
[26:27] one
[26:31] Hebrews
[26:32] 12 and then verse
[26:35] one he
[26:38] says wherefor seeing also we are
[26:41] compassed about with great a cloud of
[26:46] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[26:50] and the sin which does easily beset us
[26:52] and run with patience the race that is
[26:56] set before us
[27:25] praise the name of the Lord so he says
[27:27] let us run with
[27:31] patience the rest that is set before
[27:35] us so the rest is what is what is the
[27:40] passing
[27:42] Shadow so while the others there it is a
[27:45] l to
[27:50] them for us there is a purpose God has
[27:54] created
[27:55] us to come in our generation
[27:59] and run our
[28:00] race praise the name of our Lord to us
[28:03] it is not a loss people without Christ
[28:08] it is a
[28:09] loss praise the name of our Lord because
[28:12] they come to Earth for a short
[28:14] time and then from Earth to
[28:19] destruction praise the name of our Lord
[28:21] but then we come on us we are
[28:25] manifested we are
[28:27] tempted that we be able to possess the
[28:30] kingdom praise the name of our Lord so
[28:32] he says it is a
[28:35] rest praise the name of our Lord and
[28:39] Paul when he had run his rest he said I
[28:43] have finished my
[28:45] course praise the name of our Lord my
[28:48] set time has already been
[28:52] done and said I'm now ready to be
[28:55] offered
[28:56] up he
[28:58] scared he saw that he had done the
[29:01] purpose of
[29:02] God he was depending upon the leadership
[29:05] of the God every other
[29:07] day and that should also be the same
[29:09] thing with our lives every day that you
[29:12] raise up ask the Lord lead me through
[29:15] this day guide me through this day help
[29:19] me to know what you want me to do
[29:21] today that should be the way we pass
[29:24] through our lives every other
[29:26] day seeking the Lord
[29:29] serving the lord woring the Lord and
[29:33] doing the things that are Pleasant unto
[29:35] the
[29:36] Lord so he says when we are in
[29:40] distress let us run with
[29:43] patience and then we should look unto
[29:47] Jesus the and finish of our
[29:51] fa praise the name of just have a
[29:56] focus wherever you go whatever you do
[30:01] look on to Jesus and then you depend
[30:03] upon God and then the Lord will help you
[30:06] to run your
[30:08] race then at the end of the race you can
[30:12] say I've done the best I can for the
[30:15] Lord praise the name of our Lord and
[30:18] then the Lord will say Well done though
[30:20] my good and faithful
[30:23] Ser praise the name of our Lord you've
[30:26] done what the Lord desired
[30:29] you know you've done what the Lord has
[30:31] sent you to
[30:32] do and so we should always be
[30:36] Desiring do the will of God in our
[30:39] lives praise the name of our look at the
[30:42] story where we have
[30:44] R
[30:45] David when he had come to the end of his
[30:50] life and then he had the Zeal to build
[30:53] the house of the Lord and then the Lord
[30:56] said no but then Lord revealed to him
[30:59] the pattern of the
[31:01] house and so they were able to know what
[31:03] is
[31:04] needed so he labored and encouraged the
[31:08] people to give in and then they were
[31:11] giving all their
[31:13] possession gold they are silver every
[31:17] precious thing that they had and then
[31:19] they put them in the
[31:21] store it was exceedingly
[31:24] abundant and then David called for a
[31:26] Thanksgiving Day
[31:29] and then he started praising the
[31:31] Lord and said oh God who are
[31:36] we praise the name of our
[31:39] recognizing that he has done what is
[31:42] pleasing unto the
[31:44] Lord and the people have offered freely
[31:46] to the Lord and that's the same thing we
[31:49] should do also to freely offer our lives
[31:52] unto the Lord all your life all your
[31:56] life without your
[31:59] reservation your body you have given it
[32:01] to the Lord your human Spirit you've
[32:03] given it to the Lord your soul you've
[32:05] given it to the Lord your time you're
[32:08] giving it to the Lord your resources
[32:10] you're giving it to the Lord and so they
[32:13] offered themselves freely unto the
[32:16] Lord
[32:18] willingly with a perfect heart and they
[32:22] offered them to the Lord and David
[32:25] rejoiced with such great Jo and that
[32:29] should be our daily
[32:31] living Lord here I Amad Me Guide Me Lord
[32:36] praise the name of the Lord that's how
[32:37] we need to pass through our
[32:40] time to know that the whole of last week
[32:43] God gave me the grace I was able to do
[32:45] what he wanted to do this week I'm going
[32:48] to do the same thing so that makes you
[32:52] ready it makes you ready for the
[32:55] Rapture you're not saying oh God first

[33:06] Our Lord you are ready like Paul saying
[33:09] now I'm ready to be offered but for us
[33:12] we are not preparing to be
[33:15] offered but we are being
[33:18] prepared to be changed in our
[33:20] bodies praise the name of our Lord in a
[33:23] trinkling of night that our M bodies put
[33:28] imortality because that's the promise we
[33:30] have today the promise is the change of
[33:33] our
[33:33] bodies the promise is the
[33:37] adoption of our bodies where our motal
[33:40] bodies will become imortal that's the
[33:43] promise of the day that we have the
[33:46] rupture praise the name of our Lord this
[33:49] is the thing that is before
[33:51] us this is the crown that is set before
[33:54] us that is the mark of the High Calling
[33:59] that is our
[34:04] Target that is the the
[34:09] climax praise the name of our Lord that
[34:12] is it so every day you live I'm ready
[34:16] Lord for the change of my body praise
[34:20] the name of our Lord so David recognized
[34:23] that everything that he
[34:26] had the richest that he had the honor
[34:29] that he had he said they come from the
[34:32] Lord and then he gave that back to the
[34:37] Lord praise the name of our Lord and now
[34:39] we need to recognize also the same that
[34:42] we are not of our
[34:44] own praise the name of our Lord we are
[34:47] of the
[34:48] lordes and we need to depend upon the
[34:52] Lord in everything that we do and if the
[34:56] Lord desired something out from
[34:59] you don't be mean and say no this one
[35:01] I'm not
[35:03] giving just really say Lord It's Your I
[35:07] give it back to you praise the name of
[35:09] our Lord that's what David was doing and
[35:12] all the children of Israel praise the
[35:15] name of our Lord our days here on Earth
[35:18] the Bible says we are
[35:20] strangers and we are
[35:23] soour we just passed through just a
[35:27] short time and it's
[35:29] noal praise the name of our time it's no
[35:33] more sometimes you can be bed let me
[35:35] prepare for my children
[35:39] this but when you pass away they dispose
[35:42] them of even your grave is sold
[35:48] off they have no value for
[35:52] it
[35:54] everything say but me I don't want to
[35:57] live in that place
[35:58] I want to live in the other place for
[36:00] you what you had that's up to
[36:04] you tell it's just like a
[36:08] thought it has gone

[36:13] the days that the Lord has given unto
[36:16] us let us learn to live for
[36:19] him praise the name of our Lord let us
[36:22] go to Jeremiah
[36:24] 9 and then verse 23
[36:30] Jemiah 9 ver
[36:35] 23 the Bible
[36:37] says thus says the Lord let not the wise
[36:41] man glory in his wisdom neither let the
[36:44] Mighty Man glory in his might let not
[36:47] the rich man glory in his
[36:56] riches
[37:04] praise the name he says don't Glory when
[37:07] you have
[37:10] wisdom don't Glory because you have
[37:13] might and don't because you have
[37:16] riches and you know the days people
[37:19] strive to acquire
[37:22] this somebody will try to do a lot of
[37:26] exercises
[37:28] body praise the name of Lord another
[37:31] will try to do the best he can to
[37:33] conquer the rest to be
[37:37] powerful or work very hard and become
[37:39] too
[37:41] rich or read a lot until you get a lot
[37:44] of wisdom and
[37:47] knowledge and now the Lord is telling
[37:50] us don't glory in these
[37:53] things why it's a passing shadow they
[37:58] vanish away praise the name of our Lord
[38:01] you know the Bible says that God
[38:04] knows how to turn the wisdom of the
[38:08] wise into
[38:10] foolishness praise the name of our Lord
[38:13] that God can do it he knows how to turn
[38:16] the
[38:18] riches into
[38:20] nothing
[38:22] vanish he knows how to turn the
[38:26] powerful to a
[38:29] prisoner he does it then he says then
[38:33] the
[38:34] princess are just
[38:37] down
[38:50] rulers know how to do that so he says
[38:53] you don't have to glory in those kind
[38:56] of but what should you glory
[38:59] in in verse 24 but let him that glories
[39:03] glory in
[39:08] this that he understand and knows
[39:14] me that I am the
[39:17] Lord which exercises loving
[39:22] kindness judgment and righteousness in
[39:25] the
[39:26] eyes for in these things do I Delight
[39:30] says the
[39:33] Lord praise the name so then that should
[39:37] be the
[39:39] timate the
[39:41] desire do you know
[39:43] God praise the name of our Lord have you
[39:46] received
[39:48] salvation has have you been changed do
[39:51] you have the mind of God are you moving
[39:54] by the will of
[39:56] God you doing things that are pleasing
[39:58] to the
[39:59] Lord And now when you are doing that and
[40:03] then you have all these other
[40:05] things you not going to be
[40:08] troubled praise the name of our but when
[40:11] you have them and they are more
[40:13] important to
[40:14] you your wisdom is more important to you
[40:17] than
[40:20] God knowledge is more important to you
[40:22] than
[40:24] God riches are more important to you
[40:26] than God
[40:28] your might is all power all H is more
[40:31] important you than
[40:35] God it is a passing
[40:38] Shadow
[40:40] vanity praise the name of our Lord and
[40:42] the Bible says it is the chasing of
[40:46] wind praise the name of our Lord so we
[40:49] need to see that the time that God has
[40:51] given us here on
[40:53] Earth we use it for his service we use
[40:57] it to live for his
[40:59] kingdom we use it to seek his face and
[41:03] say Lord here I am praise the name of
[41:06] our what will you have me to
[41:08] do praise the name of our Lord let us go
[41:11] to Psalms
[41:14] 49 the wise men die likewise the fool
[41:18] and the British people person perish and
[41:21] leave their wealth to
[41:26] others
[41:39] their inward thought is that their
[41:41] houses shall continue forever and they
[41:44] ding places to all generations they call
[41:47] their lands after their own
[41:56] names
[42:05] nevertheless man being in honor abideth
[42:08] not he is like the beasts that
[42:16] perish this there way is their fly yet
[42:19] their posterity approve their
[42:26] sayings
[42:34] like ship they are laid in the grave
[42:36] Death Shall feed on them and the upright
[42:39] shall have dominion over them in the
[42:41] morning and their beauty shall consume
[42:44] in the grave from their
[42:56] dring
[43:20] but will redeem my soul from the power
[43:23] of the Grave for he shall receive
[43:25] me now
[43:36] be not though afraid when one is made
[43:38] Rich when the glory of his house is
[43:52] increased for when he dieth he shall
[43:55] carry nothing away his glory shall not
[43:57] descend after
[44:08] him praise the name of our Lord so the
[44:11] Bible says they
[44:13] perish even what they have done is Left
[44:16] Behind and it also
[44:19] perishes praise the name of our Lord but
[44:22] it says but the
[44:25] upright they shall
[44:29] dominion over them in the
[44:32] morning the Bible says that the
[44:35] meek shall inherit the
[44:38] earth praise the name of our so now
[44:41] while we are living on Earth in this
[44:44] season of passing
[44:46] Shadow we need to be
[44:49] certain that we are part of the kingdom
[44:52] of God a kingdom that's being
[44:55] established Kingdom that lives forever
[44:57] and ever praise the name of our Lord
[45:00] because that's the
[45:01] kingdom that will live here on Earth
[45:06] eternally praise the name of our Lord
[45:09] and so God showed
[45:11] Daniel when Daniel saw how these
[45:13] kingdoms come and Conquer one
[45:17] another they use
[45:19] deception they use you know kind of old
[45:22] funny things to conquer from one to the
[45:25] other we see the current state of the
[45:29] world in some other countries they use
[45:32] dictators in some other countries they
[45:34] use
[45:36] monarchies you know like the Kings and
[45:38] so
[45:39] on some other countries you know it it
[45:43] is just taking
[45:45] over then some other countries whatever
[45:49] systems that they are all over the world
[45:53] it's all going to come to pass away
[45:57] praise the name of our Lord but during
[45:59] this time God is establishing
[46:03] his God is getting his
[46:06] people God is getting people into the
[46:09] kingdom being born again in the
[46:13] kingdom and that's our desire to be born
[46:16] into the kingdom of God a kingdom that
[46:19] is forever a kingdom that shall not
[46:22] perish a kingdom that is eternal all
[46:26] other kingdoms will vanish all these
[46:29] other systems of the world will vanish
[46:31] away but the kingdom of God will never
[46:34] be moved praise the name of our Lord and
[46:37] that should be our desire every other
[46:39] day to live in that Kingdom to seek that
[46:43] Kingdom to know the will of God prise
[46:46] the name of our the Lord Tau us in our
[46:49] Lord's
[46:50] prayer that let your will be done on
[46:54] Earth as it is done in heaven
[46:58] let your kingdom come in other words be
[47:01] a subject to the kingdom of
[47:07] God prise the name of our Lord because
[47:09] it's an everlasting King it is an
[47:12] eternal
[47:13] Kingdom and then the spirit
[47:17] says the kingdom of God is within
[47:21] you says it is the Holy Ghost so then
[47:25] you have the Holy Ghost In You
[47:28] you have the Holy Ghost you get the Holy
[47:31] Ghost to be in you that's the kingdom of
[47:35] God and then the Holy Ghost will direct
[47:38] you the Holy Ghost will reveal to you
[47:40] the will of
[47:42] God every other day that you live you
[47:46] know you are living by the grace of God
[47:49] it's the will of God working in your
[47:51] life praise the name of our Lord you
[47:54] cannot enjoy the benefits of the king
[47:59] without having the power of the
[48:03] kingdom and that's the ghost working in
[48:05] our lives the Holy Ghost will give you
[48:08] the
[48:09] victory over all your
[48:11] weaknesses the Holy Ghost will give you
[48:13] the victory over all things the devil is
[48:16] trying to put around you and then you be
[48:18] able that you live above
[48:21] thetion you live above the issues that
[48:24] are happening now in the world you live
[48:26] above

[48:43] when you are sick you are
[48:46] hopeful praise the name of our Lord like
[48:49] job he said even in this body the skin
[48:53] worms eat up this
[48:55] body in my body will I see my Lord the

[49:20] the kingdom of
[49:22] God praise the name of our Lord let us
[49:25] go to Daniel chapter 7

[49:55] know Daniel when you read the book of
[49:57] Daniel you will see how the kingdoms of
[50:00] this world they take over from one
[50:03] another this one comes with reception
[50:07] this one uses
[50:08] INRI this one uses this and when Daniel
[50:12] was seeing all these
[50:14] things it terrified him but the Lord
[50:18] showed him that the sense of the most
[50:22] high shall take over the
[50:25] kingdom that Kingdom shall be forever
[50:29] and ever and
[50:31] ever and it will not be conquered by

[59:41] dirty I feel so much of a
[59:44] sinner but if you are sick and you know
[59:47] there is a hospital why don't you go to
[59:50] the
[59:51] hospital and the Bible says is the sick
[59:54] that need the physician
[59:57] and the church is for sick
[59:59] people the church is for Sinners to come
[1:00:01] and be changed into the sense of
[1:00:03] the you don't allow the devil to put
[1:00:07] that in your mind that I've sined until
[1:00:10] I can't be wored you just come there is
[1:00:14] enough blood of Jesus Christ to
[1:00:17] our praise the name of our Lord don't
[1:00:19] allow the devil to bind you out but just
[1:00:22] say Lord I'm running back to you Lord
[1:00:25] I'm coming back to you Lord I need
[1:00:27] Deliverance Lord I need
[1:00:30] healing the door is still open as long
[1:00:33] as you are still alive that means
[1:00:36] there's still Grace to
[1:00:37] help praise the name of our Lord so
[1:00:40] don't allow that kind of thing to happen
[1:00:42] to you if you fall the Bible says a
[1:00:47] righteous person falls seven
[1:00:49] times day but what makes him
[1:00:53] righteous is when he falls he doesn't
[1:00:56] remain down praise the name of our why
[1:00:59] there's the blood of Jesus Christ you
[1:01:01] just come and reach out and say Lord
[1:01:03] have
[1:01:04] mer like the prodal son he went and
[1:01:08] wasted everything of his father half of
[1:01:11] his father's living he went into a far
[1:01:14] country but when he was in the far
[1:01:17] country it came to his heart let me go
[1:01:21] back to my father and when the father
[1:01:24] saw him far away the father didn't
[1:01:27] condemn him the father didn't say don't
[1:01:29] come back but the Bible says the father
[1:01:32] R to him and so this my son was lost but
[1:01:37] now he found was dead but now he alive
[1:01:41] and that's the same thing with our Lord
[1:01:42] Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord
[1:01:46] you know the Bible says when a Shepherd
[1:01:48] is having 100
[1:01:51] sheep and then one gets
[1:01:53] lost does the and look for the
[1:01:58] one that's our Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:02:01] interested that every member of the
[1:02:05] body is in this position and so you have
[1:02:08] to believe I'm part of the body of Jesus
[1:02:13] the Rapture cannot take
[1:02:14] place without me praise the name of you
