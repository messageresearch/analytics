[32:32] hope you know whatever you fail to do
[32:37] yesterday is another opportun to do
[32:41] it today is another
[32:44] time and then Jeremiah tells
[32:48] us that thees of
[32:51] God a new every
[32:56] morning so you don't allow
[33:00] Satan to bring the sorrow of
[33:04] yesterday and then he brings it also
[33:07] today because the Bible
[33:10] sayses of the Lord are new every

[33:48] day so even us also we need to rejoice
[33:53] in the day that God has given unto us
[33:59] that song that this is the
[34:02] day the Lord has
[34:05] made will rejoice in
[34:07] it and that should be how our life
[34:10] should be
[34:12] moved praise the name of
[34:18] Lord every
[34:20] morning so when God gives you life to
[34:23] live the new day
[34:28] Grace that is given to us for that
[34:31] day there Mery that is given to us that

[34:47] your disappointments of
[34:49] yesterday your weaknesses of
[34:51] yesterday it's a new day so now you rise

[35:13] life it's a time to rejoice in his
[35:17] goodness praise the name of our Lord God

[35:36] name
[35:38] mine praise the name of the Lord God
[35:42] says you are
[35:44] mine that means he takes charge over
[35:49] everything that happens to
[35:52] you everything that you go
[35:55] through every trouble that you go go
[35:58] through he is concerned about your very
[36:02] life he knows every
[36:06] detail he knows what lays
[36:09] ahead in the life that we living
[36:12] in there's a lot of
[36:16] uncertainty you don't know what's going
[36:18] to
[36:19] happen but then you need to commit all
[36:22] your ways unto
[36:26] God will bring them to come to
[36:30] pass God will take charge over all those
[36:33] issues that concern your
[36:38] life praise the name of let us go to
[36:42] verse
[36:44] two the Bible says when you pass through
[36:48] the
[36:50] waters I will be with
[36:53] you praise the name of our Lord say when
[36:57] you pass through the
[37:00] waters so there are circumstances that
[37:03] God allows to come to our
[37:07] lives you were not created to pass
[37:10] through the
[37:11] waters you were created to pass on dry
[37:16] ground but yet the waters can
[37:19] come the floods may
[37:22] come so now when the floods
[37:25] come he gives us the assur
[37:29] that I will be with
[37:32] you so in other words he will lift you
[37:37] up that they will do you no
[37:40] harm praise the name of our Lord then he
[37:43] says when you go through the
[37:47] rivers praise the name of the Lord you
[37:50] going through the rivers a lot of
[37:53] water but what does the scripture say
[37:56] here
[37:57] they shall not overflow
[38:03] you in other words you are not going to
[38:06] drown but he raises you
[38:09] up now he does not say I will take you I
[38:14] remove the
[38:16] rivers he does not say I will remove the
[38:20] waters but he says if the waters
[38:24] come I will be with you
[38:28] if the rivers
[38:30] come they will not overtake you but you
[38:33] will go through
[38:35] them praise the name of the Lord he said
[38:39] also about the
[38:40] fires when you walk through the
[38:44] fire he didn't say I'm going to quench
[38:46] the fire
[38:49] down praise the name of but he said when
[38:52] you go through the
[38:54] fire it will not burn you
[38:58] neither shall
[38:59] def upon
[39:06] you praise the name of the Lord you see
[39:09] how interesting the promises of God
[39:12] are he says I will not stop the the
[39:17] rivers I will not stop the
[39:19] waters but now when they
[39:22] come he gives you
[39:25] Grace to pass through those St
[39:29] praise the name of Lord like the Hebrew
[39:33] children in Daniel chter
[39:37] 3 and then verse
[39:41] 25 okay we can start from ear than that
[39:45] Daniel
[39:52] 3 Daniel chapter 3 Daniel
[40:01] and then we read in
[40:07] verse and then the Bible says there are
[40:10] certain Jews whom thou Hast set over the
[40:13] Affairs of the province of Babylon
[40:15] Shadrach mishak and abano these men oh
[40:18] King have not regarded thee they serve
[40:22] not thy Gods nor I worship the golden
[40:25] image which thou Hast set up
[40:54] then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[40:57] commanded to bring Shadrach mishak and
[41:00] abano then they brought this men before
[41:04] the
[41:23] King Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto
[41:26] them is it true or shedrach mishak
[41:29] abano do not you serve my gods nor I
[41:32] worship the golden image which I have
[41:34] set
[41:55] up now you see that the three Hebrew
[41:59] children were put to a
[42:03] challenge and then they rejected
[42:06] worshiping other
[42:10] gods they rejected worshiping the golden
[42:17] image praise the name of Lord now they
[42:20] took them to the
[42:22] king and the King gave them an
[42:24] opportunity
[42:27] decide
[42:29] now whether toship my
[42:34] images or to go into the
[42:37] fire praise the name of Lord so there
[42:41] was a
[42:43] choice praise the name of our Lord goded
[42:47] them to go through
[42:50] it and then there are some STS in our
[42:53] lives
[42:57] the name of our Lord maybe God would
[43:00] permit
[43:02] them for the purpose of our
[43:08] Redemption for the purpose of his name
[43:10] being
[43:13] glorified to find out what is your
[43:17] stand to find out what is in your
[43:23] mind what decision do you make in your
[43:25] life
[43:27] [Music]
[43:28] so then we see
[43:33] that were not afraid of the King's
[43:39] Command in
[43:42] verse Shadrach mishak and abano answered
[43:45] and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar
[43:49] we are not careful to answer thee in
[43:52] this matter if it be so our God whom we
[43:56] ser love is able to Deliver Us From The
[44:00] Burning fairy furnace and he will
[44:03] deliver us out of thine hand O King but
[44:06] if not be it known unto you oh King that
[44:10] we will not serve thy Gods norship theen
[44:15] image
[44:26] set for
[44:57] praise the name of our Lord they made a
[45:01] decision we are not going to do
[45:04] something
[45:05] wrong we're not going to turn against
[45:07] our
[45:09] God even when we are faced with
[45:11] challenges in
[45:14] life you shouldn't stand against the
[45:16] word of
[45:18] God you need to stand up with the word
[45:22] of
[45:24] God praise the name of our Lord you know
[45:27] like sometimes young young
[45:31] ladies you know they want to get
[45:34] jobs and then when they go to the B of
[45:37] the
[45:39] company then the of the company tells
[45:43] them if you don't sleep with me there's
[45:46] no
[45:48] joke so you must make a
[45:52] decision I am not going to do something
[45:55] evil
[45:57] to get favor from
[46:00] you that's
[46:02] what
[46:04] doing they we are not going to serve
[46:07] your
[46:09] God our God will deliver
[46:12] us even if he doesn't Deliver
[46:15] us we are not going to do anything
[46:20] contrary praise the name of the Lord
[46:23] nez's anger raged up
[46:28] and the Bible
[46:30] says make theurn hotter seven
[46:37] times they had made it seven
[46:42] times
[46:50] says the fire consumed
[46:53] them but now Shadrach Mish and
[46:59] when they went into the
[47:01] fire praise the name of the Lord fire
[47:05] never burn
[47:07] them neither
[47:10] cloes praise the name of the Lord the
[47:13] Bible
[47:14] says nothing harmed them at
[47:20] all praise the name of our Lord where
[47:23] God has said even if you go through the
[47:26] fire
[47:29] it will not burn
[47:31] you praise the name of our Lord why
[47:34] doesn't the fire
[47:36] you because God is right there with
[47:40] you praise the name of the Lord why
[47:43] doesn't the water overtake
[47:46] you because the Lord is right there with
[47:50] you why don't the rivers sweep you away
[47:57] is because the Lord is there with
[48:00] you so you need to have
[48:03] confidence in whatever challenge you are
[48:05] going through in
[48:08] life that God is a present help in
[48:14] trouble praise the name of the Lord he
[48:17] gives you
[48:19] strength he gives you
[48:21] comfort he gives you you know
[48:25] ability to keep on going
[48:29] forward so he tells us Be not
[48:34] Afraid don't be
[48:37] troubled be a trial you're going
[48:41] through don't be
[48:44] trou just have your focus on
[48:47] God and just depend upon
[48:51] God take you whatever challenge of life
[48:54] you're going through
[48:56] I said Lord I need your
[49:00] help I need your
[49:03] deliverance praise the name of
[49:05] Lord be not
[49:09] trou not your heart be
[49:12] troubled believe in

[49:22] Jesus
[49:23] Christ because is right there in your
[49:26] strength
[49:29] the of Lord you don't allow theil to
[49:32] tell
[49:34] you now for me God has deserted
[49:39] me David say even if I go in
[49:44] hell I will get him
[49:47] there praise the name of the Lord
[49:49] there's no one place than hell right
[49:53] now but he says when if I go in hell
[49:58] I find him there how about your
[50:02] station you just need to
[50:04] recognize that the Lord is present with
[50:08] me the way he was with
[50:13] shadra praise the name of our Lord now
[50:16] in the message I
[50:18] know brother Bram says and sometimes we
[50:22] have more troubles
[50:27] when we become a
[50:30] Christian than we did when we were
[50:37] Sinners it is
[50:39] written many is the Affliction of the
[50:46] right but God delivers him from them
[50:52] all God promised many afflictions
[50:59] strange
[51:02] feelings strange
[51:05] things that would be beyond our
[51:11] understanding but it is always done for
[51:15] our
[51:17] good we just can't understand
[51:21] it because if we
[51:23] did then it would not be a Fai to
[51:28] us we would go with an
[51:34] understanding but we do it and we have
[51:39] it and we believe by
[51:44] faith his word that it is going to work
[51:48] some good thing for
[51:50] us if we could grasp that
[51:54] today all this morning
[51:58] if we could grasp that all of our
[52:02] trbl and there is none of us IM
[52:14] from and if we could realize that those
[52:17] things are for our
[52:22] good it is written in one of the
[52:25] scriptures in the
[52:27] Bible that the trials are brought upon
[52:33] us are more precious to us than
[52:38] gold for it is God giving us those this
[52:47] trials after we become his
[52:53] property our confession and our baptism
[52:59] and our promise to walk in life for
[53:05] him then every
[53:08] trial that comes upon
[53:11] us is to perfect
[53:16] us for his
[53:18] glory it is to bring us to a place where
[53:21] God can make himself more real to us
[53:30] than he was before the trial
[53:35] come I want to join this
[53:39] morning
[53:41] with to send that I've lived long
[53:46] enough to know that's the
[53:50] truth I have seen it in my own
[53:53] life that every great every time
[53:57] great stuation
[54:02] Rises I can't get around
[54:06] it or I can't go under
[54:13] it I can't go over
[54:18] it God makes a
[54:21] way and comes out glorious
[54:28] I just wonder how his grace ever does
[54:32] it but he does
[54:36] it and remember in all these
[54:40] things Satan tries to make us
[54:47] nervous upset
[54:50] us and get us to
[54:54] think oh why did this
[54:58] happen why couldn't I have been like
[55:02] this praise the name that's what brother
[55:06] is telling
[55:07] us that all Ds God permits to come our
[55:13] way they make us to know God better than
[55:17] we ever knew him
[55:19] before they make you get a
[55:23] testimony a personal testimony
[55:27] a person
[55:29] experience praise the name of our Lord
[55:32] and then he say sometimes DS
[55:36] come you cannot go over
[55:40] it you cannot go around
[55:43] it you cannot go under
[55:46] it but you are in a
[55:49] fix like the children of
[55:51] Israel when they were living Egypt
[55:57] and then the Army OFA started following
[55:59] them
[56:01] first they were walking on
[56:04] foot but the arm of was on
[56:09] chariots and now God made sure that they
[56:11] pass between mountains and so
[56:15] on and then in front they reach the Red
[56:20] Sea the armies of were coming behind
[56:23] them
[56:26] this side was a
[56:28] mountain this side was a
[56:31] mountain and the waters was before
[56:34] them and the enemy was behind
[56:38] them praise the name of Lord sometimes
[56:41] those are STS that we go
[56:44] through you can't help
[56:47] yourself you can't do anything
[56:51] much the only thing that you need to
[56:54] learn in whatever Stu you're going
[56:55] through
[56:59] the Bible
[57:00] says cast all your cares unto the
[57:05] Lord every
[57:07] burden every
[57:09] trial Lord here it
[57:12] is I don't know how to go through
[57:15] it and sometimes God permits us to make
[57:17] foolish foolish
[57:22] decisions you make a foolish decision
[57:27] then you say Lord
[57:30] me and then you allow God to give you
[57:33] the
[57:35] grace overcome that kind
[57:39] of praise the name of our
[57:41] Lord and so here brother Bram
[57:45] says that when we are going through this
[57:49] STS The Devil Makes Us to become nervous
[57:56] you know you become
[57:59] afraid you become
[58:02] troubled and then you start wondering
[58:04] how can this be
[58:08] how how overcome
[58:11] this as Satan makes us
[58:16] nervous then you can find that you are
[58:18] getting other
[58:21] diseases now there is in this message
[58:24] it's I be not afraid
[58:28] praise the name of the
[58:30] Lord he
[58:35] says now he was on
[58:38] discernment and then he was talking to
[58:40] this
[58:41] woman but you
[58:44] are one of your main
[58:49] Tres and your main trouble
[58:53] is nervious condition
[58:58] you are
[59:01] bed which has given you a stomach
[59:08] TR now you can
[59:11] imagine
[59:12] happens then you become thinking about
[59:15] that sitation all the
[59:18] time how will I clear this
[59:21] debt how am I going to pay school fees
[59:23] for my children
[59:26] how am I going to handle this
[59:29] trouble and then you think about it all
[59:32] the
[59:33] time even at night you're thinking about
[59:36] it when you wake up you're thinking
[59:38] about
[59:40] it through the night you're thinking
[59:42] about and yet the Bible tells
[59:46] us let us go to MTH then we shall come
[59:48] back to that
[59:52] scripture Matthew
[59:57] praise the name of our
[59:59] Lord and then verse
[1:00:02] 31 it says therefore take no thought
[1:00:07] saying what shall we eat or what shall
[1:00:11] we drink or where shall we be closed
[1:00:27] for all these things do the Gentile seek
[1:00:30] for your heavenly father knows that you
[1:00:32] have need of
[1:00:46] all praise the name of the Lord so TRS
[1:00:50] come STS
[1:00:52] come but what does he tell us in his
[1:00:55] word
[1:00:57] in verse 33
[1:00:59] says but seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:01:05] God
[1:01:10] his and all the things shall be added
[1:01:14] unto
[1:01:23] you take therefore no thought for for
[1:01:26] the
[1:01:27] moral for the moral shall take for the
[1:01:31] things of
[1:01:35] itself sufficient the day is the evil
[1:01:42] thereof that's what the scripture is
[1:01:44] telling
[1:01:45] us so you commit your ways unto the
[1:01:51] Lord commit your trto God
[1:01:56] I commit everything about me into your
[1:02:01] hands guide me through
[1:02:04] this if it is a
[1:02:06] river Lord give me
[1:02:09] Grace to pass through this
[1:02:12] river that I'm not overtaken by the
[1:02:17] fls praise the name of Lord don't allow
[1:02:20] to Fall by the trial you're going
[1:02:22] through
[1:02:26] to come to
[1:02:27] church I'm no longer going to read my
[1:02:31] Bible I'm no going to read message
[1:02:35] book The
[1:02:37] Devil you know the devil now is trying
[1:02:39] to trap
[1:02:41] you and then when the devil traps
[1:02:44] you it will become worse than what you
[1:02:47] are
[1:02:49] in praise the name of our Lord so that's
[1:02:52] the time you just said Lord here I am
[1:02:57] Lord help me Lord deliver
[1:03:00] me praise the name of the Lord you the
[1:03:04] example of the life of
[1:03:08] Job praise the name of our Lord he lost
[1:03:12] the children in one
[1:03:13] day he lost his animals in one day he
[1:03:17] lost many things in one day and God
[1:03:21] would
[1:03:23] permit one person to survive
[1:03:27] and comes and tells
[1:03:29] job then when this one is giving this
[1:03:33] report just finished like this another
[1:03:35] comes when this one has finished another
[1:03:38] comes when this one finishes another
[1:03:41] comes and the destruction happened in
[1:03:44] different
[1:03:45] [Music]
[1:03:48] ways the wind came and Brew the
[1:03:51] house and the house fell on the children
[1:03:54] and they all
[1:03:56] the lightning came and threw some
[1:04:00] animals then the SE also came and took
[1:04:02] some other
[1:04:04] animals then the other one again
[1:04:06] something else
[1:04:08] happened he received all these reports
[1:04:11] in one
[1:04:14] day but then the Bible says inob
[1:04:20] 1 and
[1:04:23] verse then job arose
[1:04:28] and rent his
[1:04:30] mant shaved his
[1:04:32] head fell down upon the
[1:04:35] ground and what did he do he
[1:04:39] woried praise the name of our Lord he
[1:04:42] said you are worthy oh God you worthy to
[1:04:45] be
[1:04:46] praised worth of all
[1:04:49] honor praise the name of the Lord like
[1:04:52] when Shadrach and Mish were in the fire
[1:04:56] they had a great time of
[1:04:59] worship the Bible says they were just
[1:05:02] walking in the
[1:05:04] fire and then there was the fourth
[1:05:08] person like the Son of
[1:05:11] God working with
[1:05:13] them having a great
[1:05:17] jubile praise the name of our Lord so
[1:05:20] the trials we go through are
[1:05:23] opportunities to know God better
[1:05:28] praise the name of Lord you get to know
[1:05:30] God
[1:05:34] better when you fall sick you get know
[1:05:38] God better that is
[1:05:41] healer praise the name of the Lord he
[1:05:44] killed me in this kind of disease he
[1:05:47] delivered me this kind of
[1:05:49] sttion he will also deliver me in this
[1:05:52] kind of
[1:05:54] situation God allow
[1:05:57] David to go and take of the sheep of his
[1:06:02] father and allowed the bear to come and
[1:06:05] attack the
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:07] ship and when David saw the bear taking
[1:06:10] the
[1:06:12] ship he didn't run away but he went and
[1:06:16] killed the
[1:06:18] bear praise the name of our Lord and
[1:06:21] from one Tri to another
[1:06:23] one the lion came
[1:06:27] he had more boldness to face the
[1:06:29] lion he also
[1:06:31] killed he was developing his
[1:06:36] testimony he was not
[1:06:40] troubled he was not
[1:06:42] afraid he had that kind of
[1:06:46] boldness he had that kind of
[1:06:50] confidence praise the name of our Lord
[1:06:53] and now when he goes to see his brothers
[1:06:57] and then stands up and gives a
[1:07:02] challenge prise the name of our Lord go
[1:07:05] the book of First
[1:07:09] Samuel praise the name of our
[1:07:11] Lord
[1:07:13] Samuel
[1:07:21] 1 and then we can start reading from
[1:07:25] verse vers
[1:07:27] four and there went out a champion out
[1:07:30] of the camp of the Philistines named
[1:07:32] gorus of GA whose height was six cubits
[1:07:37] and a span
[1:08:01] now when you look at these
[1:08:04] measurements Oneal and half
[1:08:14] ft you know theb is like from the the
[1:08:18] nails here up to
[1:08:32] and
[1:08:35] so when he would stand
