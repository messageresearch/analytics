[32:46] Do you love the Lord?
[32:51] You know, I remember when I was a young
[32:53] boy,
[32:56] sitting and listening to the testimonies
[32:59] of Brother Harold
[33:03] Hildebrandt and seeing what God was
[33:06] doing over in
[33:09] Africa. I never imagined
[33:14] that I would one day come and and share
[33:17] in that work of the
[33:24] Lord. But it is a real
[33:29] honor to serve with you
[33:32] brothers in what the Lord is doing over
[33:34] here.
[33:37] So, thank you for inviting me.
[33:41] And we want to
[33:47] just we want to take our Bibles and go
[33:50] back to second Peter once
[33:54] again and continue on where we left off.
[34:24] Just before we read, why don't we just
[34:26] bow our heads in a word of prayer?
[34:31] Precious heavenly father,
[34:35] Lord, we have come once again into the
[34:37] house of the Lord.
[34:41] Father, gathering with our brothers and
[34:44] sisters in Christ,
[34:48] desiring to once again look into the
[34:51] depths of your word.
[34:56] Lord, you said, "I thank thee, Father,
[35:01] that you have hid these things from the
[35:03] eyes of the wise and
[35:07] prudent and revealed them to babes such
[35:10] as we'll learn.
[35:14] Father, we have come to you believing
[35:19] and you have given us of your Holy
[35:22] Spirit,
[35:25] sparking new life within us.
[35:30] And Lord, we just desire that you would
[35:33] feed our hungry
[35:36] souls as babes that are desiring to
[35:41] learn. Father, take the word of God
[35:46] tonight. Bless the reading of
[35:49] it. Bless the hearing of
[35:52] it. Give us the uncction of the Holy
[35:57] Spirit. We ask in the name of Jesus
[35:59] Christ. Amen.
[36:03] Amen. Amen. Let's read from
[36:13] We want to read from from verse seven.
[36:21] Uh let's start at verse
[36:27] six. To knowledge
[36:30] temperance and to temperance patience
[36:33] and to patience godliness.
[36:45] into godliness brotherly kindness and to
[36:48] brotherly kindness
[36:54] charity. For if these things be in you
[36:57] and abound, they make you that you shall
[36:59] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[37:02] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:18] May God add his blessing to the word.
[37:19] You could have receipts.
[37:25] So the Bible says,
[37:28] "Add to patience
[37:32] godliness." As Peter is admonishing
[37:37] us to give
[37:41] diligence and he says add to your faith
[37:44] virtue
[37:47] to virtue
[37:50] knowledge to knowledge
[37:55] temperance and to temperance
[37:59] patience. And now he says add to
[38:02] patience
[38:06] godliness. So we find as we are walking
[38:09] with the
[38:11] Lord that he brings us higher and higher
[38:14] in Jesus
[38:18] Christ. Brother Brandham says in it is
[38:21] the rising of the
[38:23] sun. Says notice
[38:27] now if that spirit that raised up Jesus
[38:30] from the
[38:34] grave dwells in
[38:37] you, you potentially have
[38:41] life led by the
[38:44] spirit to quicken the word to you.
[38:50] to believe
[38:51] it. The little thing keeps pushing up as
[38:55] it
[38:59] grows. Remember, as we read this
[39:02] morning, he says that's the person that
[39:04] new life starts
[39:07] from, from this new
[39:10] birth. It builds another person in this
[39:13] im in the image of this person you are.
[39:20] around that
[39:22] life. So potentially it's
[39:27] here. So So he says potentially you have
[39:34] life. Led by the
[39:37] spirit. Those who are led by the spirit
[39:39] of
[39:40] God, they're the sons of God.
[39:44] So his spirit is leading
[39:47] us quickening the
[39:52] word. Faith is coming by hearing the
[39:56] word hear of
[39:59] God and that word now the spirit is
[40:03] taking that
[40:06] word and quickening that life within
[40:12] us. So everything that you need is
[40:15] already inside of you.
[40:20] But it takes the word of God
[40:24] anointed by the
[40:26] spirit to bring it to
[40:29] life to bring it into its
[40:33] potential. When we plant the seed of a
[40:37] tree and we water that
[40:41] seed, one
[40:44] plants and another
[40:49] waters, God gives the
[40:52] increase. It's his spirit that brings
[40:57] life. Potentially, all of the life is in
[41:00] there.
[41:05] In that one seed that we
[41:08] planted is all the potentials of the
[41:11] fruit the tree will bear.
[41:18] But it must keep
[41:21] feeding, feeding upon the
[41:26] sunlight, drinking in the
[41:30] water, spreading its roots in the good
[41:36] soil. And as it feeds on those
[41:41] things, it begins to
[41:44] grow and produce the
[41:48] potentials. But if we planted that
[41:52] seed, we're not happy with just a little
[41:55] green
[41:57] chute. We're not happy with a couple
[42:02] branches. If we planted the mango seed,
[42:08] We're not happy until we receive mangoes
[42:15] back. So, it's our desire that it would
[42:18] grow into a great
[42:21] [Music]
[42:23] tree and produce much
[42:27] fruit. And it's God's desire that we
[42:30] would produce much fruit.
[42:35] He's not happy with just a little bit of
[42:37] life in our
[42:40] hearts. He's not happy with just the
[42:43] quickening of his
[42:45] spirit. But he wants to keep quickening
[42:49] you word after
[42:53] word, line after
[42:55] line, that you would not be
[42:59] barren, that you would not be
[43:01] [Music]
[43:03] unfruitful, because he saw an image of
[43:05] you before the world
[43:08] began, of a fruitful
[43:12] tree, a tree with much leaves.
[43:17] to give shade to those around
[43:21] it. A tree with much
[43:25] fruit to give life to those around
[43:29] it. Jesus said, "I'm the
[43:33] vine, but you are the
[43:36] branches. And except the branch abides
[43:39] in the
[43:41] vine, it cannot bear fruit.
[43:46] He said, "Except you abide in
[43:49] me and my words abide in
[43:52] you, you cannot bear
[43:55] fruit." So we we have come into Jesus
[44:00] Christ and now we are growing into a
[44:03] fruitful
[44:07] tree. We can read about that tree in
[44:09] Psalms chapter one.
[44:14] I'm sure you all know the
[44:22] scripture. Psalms 1 and verse one says,
[44:25] "Blessed is the man that walketh not in
[44:28] the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth
[44:32] in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the
[44:34] seat of the scornful.
[44:49] That's the believer. Come again. That's
[44:51] the
[44:54] believer. He's come out of the way of
[44:58] sinners and he's been birthed into a new
[45:01] and a living
[45:04] way. But his delight is in the law of
[45:08] the Lord.
[45:13] When you are born again by the spirit of
[45:17] God, Christian life is not a
[45:24] hardship. It's
[45:27] hard. It's
[45:30] difficult. There's much
[45:33] suffering, but but it's it's not a
[45:36] hardship.
[45:40] it. It's something that you delight to
[45:44] do. Our delight is in the law of the
[45:47] Lord.
[45:50] We delight in the chastening of the
[45:54] Lord because we know that when we are
[45:58] chasened, brought back in line with the
[46:02] word, that means that we are sons.
[46:07] And if children then
[46:11] hes of God and joint hes with
[46:16] Christ. So our delight now by the new
[46:21] birth is in his
[46:25] law. Let me just turn to Romans chapter
[46:28] 12 for a moment.
[46:36] He says,"I beseech you therefore,
[46:38] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[46:41] you present your bodies a living
[46:44] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[46:47] which is your reasonable service.
[47:04] So before we entered into
[47:08] God through the blood of Jesus
[47:12] Christ, Christian life was a
[47:17] hardship. It was a life of dos and
[47:22] don'ts. You do this, you do this, you do
[47:24] this.
[47:27] You don't do this. You don't do this.
[47:28] You
[47:30] don't. It was a life of pointing fingers
[47:32] at one
[47:36] another. You're doing this
[47:38] wrong. You're doing that
[47:41] wrong. You're doing this wrong. You're
[47:44] doing that
[47:45] wrong. But so, so there there was much
[47:50] strife. But now you have come into
[47:53] Christ.
[47:56] and and now we present our bodies as a
[47:59] living sacrifice to God.
[48:05] Paul said, "I am crucified with
[48:10] Christ." Nevertheless, I
[48:14] live yet not I, it's Christ that lives
[48:17] in
[48:19] me. And the life that I now
[48:23] live, I live through faith in the Lord
[48:28] Jesus. So something has changed.
[48:34] There's a a new
[48:36] nature. And now we willingly offer
[48:39] ourselves to
[48:42] God. We're not offering our mighty
[48:45] works. We're not offering our good
[48:47] deeds.
[48:49] We have offered our life unto
[48:53] him. All that we
[48:55] have, all of our
[48:57] ambitions, all of our
[49:00] hopes, all of our
[49:02] dreams, we lay them at his
[49:05] feet. Say, Lord, my life now belongs to
[49:11] you. and and this
[49:14] sacrifice now through
[49:17] Christ is acceptable unto God.
[49:22] There there was many sacrifices that the
[49:24] Pharisees
[49:27] made. Many many sacrifices the priests
[49:31] made. They made so many
[49:35] rules. Oh, you have to wash your pots.
[49:40] Make sure you wash your hands before you
[49:43] eat. And they they saw the disciples of
[49:47] the
[49:48] Lord and they were eating with unwashed
[49:53] hands. Said, "Oh, your disciples eat
[49:56] without
[49:59] washing." They're going against the
[50:02] traditions of the
[50:05] elders. But Jesus said, "By their
[50:07] traditions,
[50:11] They made the word of God of no
[50:18] effect. When
[50:23] when when when you live a life of dos
[50:26] and
[50:29] don'ts, the word of God has no
[50:34] effect. When you try to live by a set of
[50:37] rules,
[50:40] The word of God has no
[50:43] effect. Because the word did not come to
[50:46] bring a set of
[50:49] rules. The word of God came to bring us
[50:52] into Jesus
[50:56] Christ. And now in Jesus
[51:00] Christ, now we've become a love slave to
[51:04] him.
[51:09] Now the things we do, we do them because
[51:11] we love
[51:15] God, because we want to do
[51:20] them. Because we want to be pleasing to
[51:24] him. So he says in
[51:28] Christ, this is an acceptable sacrifice
[51:31] to God.
[51:37] which is your reasonable
[51:42] service. Before you came to
[51:45] Christ, it was
[51:50] unreasonable. You could never be good
[51:54] enough. When you thought you were doing
[51:57] so
[52:00] good, somebody would find something that
[52:02] you weren't doing
[52:06] right and say, "Oh, I've tried so
[52:10] hard." And now I have to also do
[52:15] this. It's not good enough that I come
[52:17] to church on
[52:20] Sunday. Now I have to pay my tithes.
[52:25] It's not good enough that I pay my
[52:27] tithes. Now you want me to come to
[52:29] church two
[52:32] times. Now you want me to live a clean
[52:35] life at
[52:39] home. Now you're saying you want my wife
[52:42] to dress
[52:45] properly. Now you're saying I can't go
[52:48] to the
[52:50] bar. You're saying I can't have a drink
[52:52] with my friends.
[52:55] Oh, this is too
[52:57] difficult. This is
[53:01] unreasonable. But when you come to
[53:05] Christ and you lay your life at his
[53:08] feet and he fills you with his Holy
[53:12] Spirit, now what once seemed
[53:17] unreasonable now becomes a reasonable
[53:19] soul.
[53:22] [Applause]
[53:24] Now it becomes something that is natural
[53:26] to
[53:30] you. Now you're wondering when the
[53:33] church doors
[53:36] open because you want to be
[53:38] there. Now you're wondering about every
[53:41] place that you go
[53:45] into. Lord, is this pleasing to you?
[53:50] this is grievious to your
[53:53] spirit then Lord I don't want to go
[53:57] here the the life that we
[54:00] live is now totally
[54:05] different we think that reasoning is a
[54:08] bad
[54:11] thing it was reasoning that caused the
[54:14] fall in the garden of
[54:18] Eden but there is a right kind of
[54:23] reasoning. The Bible says, "Come and let
[54:26] us reason together sayeth the
[54:31] Lord." Now, when you are walking with
[54:34] the
[54:35] Lord, you are reasoning with the
[54:39] Lord. Lord, what is pleasing to
[54:42] you? What What about this over here?
[54:47] and and and we might feel condemned
[54:49] about something that we're
[54:52] doing. We say, "Lord, I feel condemned
[54:55] about
[54:55] this. Is this thing not pleasing to
[54:59] you? Show me in thy
[55:02] word. Open my
[55:04] eyes. Then I might see why this is
[55:07] convicting me.
[55:09] You're reasoning with the
[55:12] Lord and his spirit is bringing you back
[55:14] in line with the will of God.
[55:18] What was once
[55:20] unreasonable now becomes
[55:26] reasonable and be not conformed to this
[55:31] world, but be transformed by the
[55:34] renewing of your mind.
[55:39] that you may prove what is that good and
[55:42] acceptable and perfect will of
[55:47] God. So by coming to the
[55:50] word and by letting the word of God mold
[55:55] you and transform your mind,
[56:00] transform
[56:02] you by the renewing of your
[56:06] mind. Changing your character from the
[56:09] ways of the
[56:13] world to the ways of his word.
[56:19] God is going to prove through your
[56:24] life what is that good and acceptable
[56:27] and perfect will of
[56:31] God. He's taking
[56:34] you. You are his proof.
[56:40] The de the devil comes before
[56:44] God and and God
[56:46] says, "Have you considered my servant
[56:49] Job?"
[56:52] And and God proved his word through
[56:57] Job. And the devil is the accuser of the
[57:01] brethren.
[57:04] He comes before
[57:07] God and and accuses us of things that
[57:10] we've done.
[57:13] Lord, look at what they did
[57:15] here. Look at what they did over there.
[57:18] Look at all their
[57:20] mistakes. Oh, God says he's a perfect
[57:25] man. He is
[57:28] evil because God is not looking at your
[57:32] flesh.
[57:34] When God looks down at
[57:36] you, he's looking through the blood of
[57:39] Jesus Christ.
[57:42] And he doesn't see your
[57:44] mistakes. He doesn't see your
[57:47] failures because you put them under the
[57:49] blood of
[57:51] Jesus. And he says, "That is my virtuous
[57:56] heart. That's my spotless people."
[58:02] The devil says, "God, how can you not
[58:05] see these
[58:07] things?" God says, "I don't know what
[58:10] you're talking
[58:12] about. All I see is the
[58:17] perfection that I saw in my mind before
[58:19] the
[58:24] through the blood of Jesus
[58:26] Christ." Amen. His delight is in the law
[58:30] of the Lord.
[58:34] And in his law do he meditate day and
[58:40] night. So what kind of a people are
[58:44] we? We're not meditating on our favorite
[58:47] sports
[58:52] team. We're not meditating on our
[58:54] favorite movies.
[59:00] We're not meditating on the music of
[59:02] this
[59:05] world in all of its ungodly
[59:10] forms. But we are meditating upon the
[59:13] law of
[59:16] God. We are meditating upon his word.
[59:21] It's written upon our
[59:23] hearts, the tables of our
[59:27] hearts. It's all we want to think
[59:31] about. Oh, this flesh wants to do other
[59:35] things. This flesh wants to get caught
[59:37] up in
[59:39] sports. This flesh wants to get caught
[59:41] up in
[59:44] entertainment. But when we get caught up
[59:46] in those things,
[59:50] something inside of us begins to well
[59:55] up. Somehow the things that we once
[1:00:00] enjoyed, we don't enjoy them
[1:00:04] anymore. And before
[1:00:07] long, we think, "What am I doing here?
[1:00:12] I want to be at
[1:00:13] church or I want to be in
[1:00:16] prayer or I want to be feeding on the
[1:00:20] word. Something within us has
[1:00:24] changed and we want to meditate upon his
[1:00:26] word day and
[1:00:29] night. And anything that hinders us from
[1:00:33] meditating with the
[1:00:37] Lord begins to be something that we no
[1:00:42] longer are interested in
[1:00:47] doing because it keeps us from that
[1:00:49] which we really
[1:00:54] enjoy. The Bible says he shall be like a
[1:00:57] tree.
[1:01:01] planted by rivers of
[1:01:04] water and bringeth bringeth forth his
[1:01:07] fruit in his season.
[1:01:12] His leaf also will not
[1:01:16] wither. And whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:01:19] prosper.
[1:01:23] We've entered into the Lord
[1:01:27] and we've given diligence to the things
[1:01:29] of
[1:01:31] God. That's where our stability comes
[1:01:35] from. That's where our strength comes
[1:01:37] from.
[1:01:39] Not because we come from a good
[1:01:42] family, not because we go to church on
[1:01:45] Sunday, but because we are meditating
[1:01:48] upon the word of
[1:01:50] God. We are walking with the Lord day
[1:01:53] and
[1:01:55] night. And that has strengthened
[1:01:58] us, that has stabilized
[1:02:01] us, that has rooted and grounded us.
[1:02:08] God will test you
[1:02:12] to prove what you're standing
[1:02:19] on. We all have to come to a place in
[1:02:22] our
[1:02:24] lives where we recognize that Christ is
[1:02:27] the most important one in our life.
[1:02:34] Not not that He wants to be the most
[1:02:36] important
[1:02:39] thing, but because of the new
[1:02:43] birth, he is the most important
[1:02:48] thing. So, he will pull everything else
[1:02:51] away from our
[1:02:55] lives until it's just us and God alone.
[1:03:02] Just like he did with Job.
[1:03:05] He might not take away your family.
[1:03:08] He might not take away your wealth.
[1:03:12] But if we allow something to raise up in
[1:03:14] our
[1:03:17] life that we that begins to come between
[1:03:20] us and
[1:03:23] God and we begin to say, "Ah, this has
[1:03:27] given me success.
[1:03:30] This has given me strength.
[1:03:33] Oh, I'm a believer because my family was
[1:03:35] a believer.
[1:03:38] I'm a believer because my dad was a
[1:03:41] believer, because my grandpa's a
[1:03:45] believer. But it but when if we begin to
[1:03:48] develop that kind of an
[1:03:52] attitude, God will pull those things out
[1:03:55] of our life.
[1:04:02] He had to take my own mother out of my
[1:04:07] life. He had to send my father to a city
[1:04:10] that was far
[1:04:13] away. All my brothers and sisters left
[1:04:16] the town that I lived
[1:04:19] in until it was just me standing alone.
[1:04:27] God had a purpose for those things in in
[1:04:30] all of their lives
[1:04:33] also. But for
[1:04:35] me, God had to separate me
[1:04:40] away to show
[1:04:42] me that my walk was not based on my
[1:04:48] father. My walk was not based on my
[1:04:51] mother.
[1:04:53] It was not based upon having family
[1:04:58] around. But he wanted a personal
[1:05:00] relationship with
[1:05:04] me. He wanted He wanted to show me that
[1:05:07] he was my
[1:05:10] strength. He wanted to show me that he
[1:05:13] was my
[1:05:16] comfort. He wanted to show me that he
[1:05:18] was my refuge.
[1:05:22] that though all else should
[1:05:25] leave yet he would never leave
[1:05:28] me nor forsake
[1:05:31] me. So God will take you to that place
[1:05:34] in your
[1:05:37] life. Whatever it
[1:05:39] takes because you are a son or daughter
[1:05:42] of
[1:05:43] God, he will take you to that
[1:05:47] place so that you can recognize
[1:05:51] that he is everything to you.
[1:05:55] That when you have him, you have
[1:06:01] everything and he will prove to the
[1:06:05] devil that you are his
[1:06:10] child. No matter what hardship comes
[1:06:13] your
[1:06:15] way, you will not turn away from the
[1:06:17] word of God.
[1:06:20] Not because you're so
[1:06:22] strong, not because you're able,
[1:06:27] but because his spirit dwells in you.
[1:06:35] Amen.
[1:06:41] Godliness means to be like God.
[1:06:52] Many think to be like God is is uh to
[1:06:56] have authority over
[1:07:03] everybody. But the pope was not the
[1:07:05] image of God.
[1:07:11] is the image of the invisible
[1:07:15] God. So if we want to know what it means
[1:07:18] to be like
[1:07:21] God, we don't look for the holiest
[1:07:23] bishop in the
[1:07:26] area, who is the most
[1:07:29] powerful, who has the most
[1:07:32] churches. But we must look to
[1:07:36] Christ. Then we can know what it means
[1:07:39] to be like God.
[1:07:43] In Revelations chapter
[1:07:45] 3, Bible says, "I counsel thee to buy of
[1:07:48] me gold tried in the
[1:07:54] fire that thou mayest be
[1:07:56] rich." In the Leodysian church
[1:08:00] age, brother Brennham says, "You better
[1:08:02] come before it's too
[1:08:06] late, sayaeth the Lord and buy of me
[1:08:10] gold tried in the
[1:08:13] fire, and then you will be truly
[1:08:16] rich." He says, "Are we getting
[1:08:19] it?" Listen to me.
[1:08:23] Naked physically, we came into the
[1:08:25] world.
[1:08:27] But naked spiritually we will not leave
[1:08:30] it.
[1:08:34] Oh no, we're going to take something
[1:08:36] with us.
[1:08:39] What that something
[1:08:41] is all that we can take with
[1:08:44] us. Nothing less and nothing
[1:08:49] more. So we had better be real careful
[1:08:52] now
[1:08:55] to see that we take something that will
[1:08:57] make us right before
[1:09:03] God. So then what will we take with
[1:09:07] us? We will take our character
[1:09:11] brother. That is what we will take with
[1:09:13] us. Now what kind of a character will
[1:09:16] you take with you?
[1:09:19] Will it be like
[1:09:22] his character was molded by
[1:09:28] suffering in the fiery furnace of
[1:09:34] affliction? Or will it be the
[1:09:40] softness of this of this characterless
[1:09:44] Leodysian
[1:09:47] people? It is up to each one of
[1:09:51] us. Each one of us from the young people
[1:09:55] to the old
[1:09:57] people. For in that day every man will
[1:10:00] bear his own.
[1:10:04] So what kind of a character did Christ
[1:10:06] have
[1:10:09] in in Philippians chapter 2?
[1:10:13] The Bible says let this mind be in you
[1:10:15] which was also in
[1:10:18] Christ who being in the form of
[1:10:22] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:10:25] with God.
[1:10:33] Philippians 2 and verse 7,
[1:10:39] but made himself of no reputation and
[1:10:42] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:10:45] was made in the likeness of
[1:10:52] man. We want to have godliness.
[1:10:59] We want to be like
[1:11:01] God. Are we willing to take upon us the
[1:11:04] form of a
[1:11:09] servant? Are we willing to
[1:11:12] serve? Are we willing to
[1:11:15] give or do we just want to
[1:11:18] take? To be like God, we need to be
[1:11:21] willing to serve.
[1:11:26] And being found in fashion as a man, he
[1:11:29] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:11:32] death, even the death of the cross.
[1:11:48] So he knew who he
[1:11:50] was. He knew that the fullness of the
[1:11:53] God had b dwelt bodily in
[1:11:57] him. But that didn't make him
[1:12:01] proud. when when he found himself in in
[1:12:05] fashion as a
[1:12:08] man, he looked into the word of
[1:12:12] God and he found who he
[1:12:17] was and he humbled himself to be the
[1:12:20] word that he was called to be.
[1:12:24] [Music]
[1:12:27] And when we find out that it's God that
[1:12:29] dwells in us,
[1:12:34] Now we have a piece of God in
[1:12:38] us. In Christ the mystery of God
[1:12:41] revealed.
[1:12:44] Brother Brandham says the whole thing is
[1:12:46] God and man one.
[1:12:52] So when we find out that God has been
[1:12:54] united with
[1:12:57] us by the new
[1:12:59] birth, the work of the Holy
[1:13:02] Spirit, the question
[1:13:04] is, are we willing to humble
[1:13:08] ourselves and become obedient to the
[1:13:11] word of God?
[1:13:14] Not the word for another day.
[1:13:18] But the word for
[1:13:20] today because it's the word for today
[1:13:23] that tells you who you
[1:13:27] are. The word for Luther's day told them
[1:13:30] who they
[1:13:33] were. That the just shall live by
[1:13:36] faith. The word for Wesley's day told
[1:13:39] them who they were.
[1:13:42] that they ought to live a sanctified
[1:13:46] life. But the word for your day is
[1:13:51] more. It takes you beyond
[1:13:55] justification, beyond living a
[1:13:57] sanctified
[1:13:59] life into the fullness of the revelation
[1:14:02] of
[1:14:04] God that you are the bride of Jesus
[1:14:09] Christ. And it's your purpose to be the
[1:14:12] word of God in your
[1:14:16] day, to be the expression of Christ.
[1:14:21] And are you willing to humble
[1:14:24] yourself and no longer become an
[1:14:26] expression of your own
[1:14:29] self, but become an expression of the
[1:14:32] word of God.
[1:14:37] Peter said we need to give all
[1:14:42] diligence and if we would add these
[1:14:46] things that we would desire to do the
[1:14:49] will of
[1:14:50] God instead of our own
[1:14:53] will then we shall be neither barren nor
[1:14:56] unfruitful.
[1:15:05] So he says he became obedient unto death
[1:15:09] even the death of the
[1:15:13] cross. Then in verse
[1:15:16] 12 he says wherefore my
[1:15:19] beloved as ye have always
[1:15:23] obeyed not in my presence
[1:15:27] only but now much more in my absence.
[1:15:33] Work out your own salvation with fear
[1:15:36] and
[1:15:41] trembling. Paul was not worried whether
[1:15:44] or not they obeyed
[1:15:47] him. But he was talking about being
[1:15:50] obedient to the
[1:15:53] word. He says, "You've been obedient
[1:15:55] when I was
[1:15:57] there, and you've been obedient to the
[1:16:00] word when I'm gone.
[1:16:04] And it's important that you are obedient
[1:16:06] to the
[1:16:08] word because as we yield ourselves to
[1:16:11] the
[1:16:12] word to what God has for us
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:16] today, we will work out our own
[1:16:19] salvation with fear and
[1:16:24] tremble. For it is God that workketh in
[1:16:27] you.
[1:16:30] You can't do it on your
[1:16:32] own, but it's God that works in
[1:16:36] you to will and to do his good pleasure.
[1:16:43] He will bring you right into the will of
[1:16:45] God.
[1:16:50] Jesus said it's it's not whoever saith
[1:16:53] Lord Lord
[1:16:56] that will enter into the kingdom of
[1:17:00] heaven but it's whosoever doeth the will
[1:17:03] of my
[1:17:05] father. He said, "Many will come to me
[1:17:08] in that
[1:17:10] day, say, have not we done many mighty
[1:17:14] works, and we've cast out
[1:17:17] devils, done all these great
[1:17:20] things?" And he will say unto them,
[1:17:23] "Depart from me, you workers of
[1:17:27] iniquity, for I never knew
[1:17:30] you." So the will of God is not great
[1:17:33] mighty works.
[1:17:36] The will of God is that you would know
[1:17:42] him. For we are his
[1:17:46] workmanship, created in Christ
[1:17:50] Jesus unto good
[1:17:52] works, which God hath before ordained
[1:17:56] that we should walk in them.
[1:18:00] So God always had something for you to
[1:18:04] do. Not your own
[1:18:07] works, but his
[1:18:10] works. And so he has brought you into
[1:18:13] Christ that you might do the works that
[1:18:16] he's always ordained for you to
[1:18:19] do that you might be the reflection of
[1:18:22] him that you are called to
[1:18:25] be. Amen.
[1:18:28] Brother Brandham says in the Pergamian
[1:18:29] church age,
[1:18:32] he says, "Notice the harmony of the son
[1:18:35] of the father and the son."
[1:18:41] Jesus never did anything until it was
[1:18:43] first showed him by the
[1:18:47] father. That's John 5:19.
[1:18:52] This harmony is now to
[1:18:58] exist between the groom and his
[1:19:04] bride. He shows her his word of
[1:19:09] life. She receives
[1:19:12] it. She never doubts
[1:19:15] it. Therefore, nothing can harm her.
[1:19:21] Not even
[1:19:24] death. That's you. He's speaking about
[1:19:27] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:30] The word and the bride become
[1:19:34] one perfectly in
[1:19:37] harmony. Says nothing can harm
[1:19:40] her. Nothing can harm
[1:19:43] you, not even death.
[1:19:47] For if the seed be
[1:19:50] planted, the water will raise it up
[1:19:53] again. Here is the secret of
[1:19:56] this. The word is in the
[1:20:00] bride as it was in
[1:20:03] Mary. The bride has the mind of
[1:20:09] Christ. For she knows what he wants done
[1:20:12] with the word.
[1:20:16] she performs the command of the
[1:20:21] word in his
[1:20:23] name for she has thus sayeth the
[1:20:28] Lord. Oh, she knows what he wants done
[1:20:31] with the
[1:20:33] word. She is great. She's recognized the
[1:20:37] will of God.
[1:20:40] She's not taking the
[1:20:42] word and trying to produce many signs
[1:20:46] and
[1:20:48] wonders and miracles.
[1:20:52] But she is taking the
[1:20:54] word and she is being clothed in the
[1:20:58] word. She's walking in oneness with the
[1:21:03] word. She she is in fellowship with the
[1:21:06] person of the word.
[1:21:11] The marriage supper of the lamb is
[1:21:15] come and his wife has made herself
[1:21:20] ready. She didn't have to raise herself
[1:21:23] up to a certain level of
[1:21:27] greatness. No, she had to be
[1:21:32] clothed. to her was
[1:21:36] granted that she might be arrayed in
[1:21:38] white linen,
[1:21:42] which is the righteousness of the
[1:21:45] saints. The righteousness of the saints
[1:21:48] is not our
[1:21:52] righteousness, but he became sin for
[1:21:57] us so that we might become the
[1:22:00] righteousness of God.
[1:22:03] So we have taken his
[1:22:06] word and been clothed in it.
[1:22:11] Not put it on a shelf
[1:22:14] somewhere. Not put a big list of quotes
[1:22:18] somewhere. Not a stack of dusty
[1:22:21] Bibles. She has become the
[1:22:25] word. She and the word are one.
[1:22:30] She is clothed in this word,
[1:22:35] ready for the mar's supper of the lamb.
[1:22:47] Says, she performs the command of the
[1:22:50] word in his
[1:22:54] name, for she has thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:22:59] Then the word is quickened by the
[1:23:04] spirit and it comes to
[1:23:07] pass. Heavens and earth will pass
[1:23:10] away. But Jesus said, "My word shall not
[1:23:15] fail. Our word will
[1:23:18] fail." Amen. We're not here to feed on
[1:23:20] the word of a man
[1:23:23] dream, but we're feeding upon the
[1:23:26] unfailing body word of the son of
[1:23:30] God. His word will not fail.
[1:23:34] There will be a
[1:23:36] bride that is clothed in his
[1:23:40] word prepared for a
[1:23:44] rapture. Prepared for a wedding
[1:23:48] supper. What prepares a bride for the
[1:23:51] wedding
[1:23:53] supper? Not that the not that she showed
[1:23:56] up on that
[1:23:59] day, but what prepares her for the
[1:24:01] wedding supper.
[1:24:05] is that she was part of the wedding
[1:24:09] ceremony. And when she is united with
[1:24:13] her
[1:24:16] groom, now she is ready for the wedding
[1:24:20] supper. Okay, let me just explain that.
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:40] You can continue.
[1:24:52] Amen. It says, "Then the word is
[1:24:55] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[1:24:56] pass.
[1:25:02] like a seed that is planted and
[1:25:06] watered. It comes to full
[1:25:12] harvest, serving its
[1:25:16] purpose. Those in the bride do only his
[1:25:22] will. No one can make them do otherwise.
[1:25:29] She's become a mature
[1:25:32] woman. She's not a child
[1:25:35] anymore tossed to and fro by winds of
[1:25:41] doctrine. She's a mature
[1:25:44] woman and she accepts his
[1:25:47] word. She doesn't want any other man's
[1:25:51] word. She doesn't want any other
[1:25:53] husband.
[1:25:58] As Paul said, I have espoused you to
[1:26:05] Christ. She's not interested in a man's
[1:26:11] word. She's not interested in
[1:26:16] organizing. She's not interested in
[1:26:18] building a headquarters.
[1:26:22] She is interested in her
[1:26:27] husband, in her bridegroom,
[1:26:31] which is the word of
[1:26:34] God. She wants the word of God
[1:26:39] alone, and that's all she
[1:26:45] wants. They have thus sayaeth the Lord,
[1:26:48] or they keep still.
[1:26:56] They know that it has to be
[1:27:03] God. God in them doing the
[1:27:09] works, fulfilling his own
[1:27:14] word. It's not her word.
[1:27:19] The word is the
[1:27:21] seed. The woman doesn't have her own
[1:27:25] seed. It's the seed of a man.
[1:27:29] The bride doesn't have her own
[1:27:33] word. But it's the word of Christ.
[1:27:38] She knows it has to be God in them doing
[1:27:41] the
[1:27:45] works, fulfilling his own
[1:27:55] word. She's not chasing after mighty
[1:28:02] works. The Bible says, "These signs
[1:28:05] shall follow them that believe.
[1:28:10] The Bible or the bride is not chasing
[1:28:13] after
[1:28:18] works, but these signs are following the
[1:28:27] bride. They're following her because she
[1:28:30] has the
[1:28:34] word. And God always vindicates his word
[1:28:38] with signs and
[1:28:43] wonders. Signs naturally follow the
[1:28:50] believer. But because she and the word
[1:28:53] are
[1:28:56] one and God always vindicates that he is
[1:29:00] with you.
[1:29:05] Not just
[1:29:08] sometimes but all the time.
[1:29:12] He said, "I will never leave
[1:29:16] you. I will never forsake you."
[1:29:23] And she knows that his
[1:29:27] will is to be conformed to his image.
[1:29:43] godliness. She's putting on
[1:29:49] godliness. Sons and daughters of God
[1:29:51] putting on
[1:29:54] godliness. What makes them
[1:29:57] godly? Not this outside man.
[1:30:02] but because she's doing the will of
[1:30:07] God because she does nothing but what
[1:30:10] the word shows her
[1:30:20] first. Add to brotherly kind Add to
[1:30:23] godliness brotherly kindness.
[1:30:30] the inner man that God is
[1:30:35] molding bringing you into perfect
[1:30:37] harmony with
[1:30:41] him in the message the
[1:30:45] Messiah Brandham says now when a man is
[1:30:49] converted just like that little white
[1:30:52] button starts in his
[1:30:56] heart says now that part is
[1:31:00] God when he's born again with the spirit
[1:31:03] of
[1:31:06] God. God's spirit dwells in
[1:31:10] him. Now he can let that spirit
[1:31:16] grow and take out all the roots of
[1:31:19] bitterness.
[1:31:24] and press God's way through him
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:30] again, he can become back in the same
[1:31:36] condition that he was when he was in the
[1:31:39] Garden of Eden.
[1:31:44] So this this work that God is doing in
[1:31:46] your
[1:31:48] life will push out all of the
[1:31:53] bitterness will push God's way
[1:31:56] completely through
[1:31:59] you. Brother Brandham says God wants to
[1:32:02] fill every fiber of your
[1:32:06] being. He doesn't want to fill you just
[1:32:08] a little
[1:32:09] bit, but he wants to fill every fiber of
[1:32:12] your being.
[1:32:15] He wants to fill all of your
[1:32:19] thoughts. He wants to fill your every
[1:32:21] action
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:24] until you're completely God and man
[1:32:27] united
[1:32:32] together in perfect
[1:32:35] harmony back in the condition that we
[1:32:38] were in Eden.
[1:32:41] perfect harmony with
[1:32:45] God. So God will push out all the
[1:32:48] bitterness out of your
[1:32:52] life. So as God is building you up into
[1:32:55] the perfection of his
[1:32:59] character, when we come close to
[1:33:03] God, we don't become bitter.
[1:33:09] It doesn't make us proud.
[1:33:13] It doesn't make us think we're better
[1:33:15] than everybody
[1:33:18] else. If we begin to think that we are
[1:33:21] better than everybody
[1:33:23] else, then we have gotten off of the
[1:33:26] trail somewhere.
[1:33:30] We have left the truth of God's word
[1:33:32] behind
[1:33:35] and we need to come back to
[1:33:39] Christ because it doesn't say add to
[1:33:42] godliness
[1:33:46] pride. It doesn't say add to to
[1:33:49] godliness
[1:33:51] uh important looking clothes.
[1:33:59] It doesn't say with godliness you have
[1:34:01] the ability to lift yourself
[1:34:08] up, but add to godliness brotherly
[1:34:14] kindness. So the closer you get to
[1:34:18] God, the more that God is able to use
[1:34:23] you, the more you will love one
[1:34:27] another, the more you will love your
[1:34:29] brothers and
[1:34:31] sisters. The more you will want to help
[1:34:35] them, the more you will want to lift
[1:34:38] them
[1:34:40] up. The more you will care for the
[1:34:42] sinner,
[1:34:46] the more you will want to bring them to
[1:34:50] Christ. When you get close to
[1:34:54] God, it doesn't make you want to push
[1:34:56] everybody else
[1:34:59] away so that you can stand
[1:35:01] alone. So everybody can see
[1:35:04] you. But it makes you want to gather
[1:35:09] everybody to see what you have seen.
[1:35:15] Now you're becoming like a
[1:35:18] tree. Your branches are spreading out
[1:35:23] wide. And under those
[1:35:26] branches comes
[1:35:30] fellowship. Under those branches comes
[1:35:34] peace. Under those branches comes
[1:35:38] happiness. Comes refuge.
[1:35:45] because you've come close to
[1:35:48] God and now his spirit is working
[1:35:51] through
[1:35:53] you. The life of Christ is on display.
[1:36:00] Jesus said, "By this shall all men
[1:36:05] know that you're my disciples,
[1:36:09] that you have love one for
[1:36:14] another. Not because there's more
[1:36:17] miracles, not because there's more more
[1:36:21] riches, not because the churches are
[1:36:24] nicer, not because the people are
[1:36:27] better. This shall all men know you are
[1:36:31] his
[1:36:33] disciples because you love one
[1:36:36] another. Because when a brother
[1:36:41] falls, you don't want to push him
[1:36:44] away. You want to bring him back to
[1:36:48] Christ. There's a love one for
[1:36:51] another. When brother Brandham was on
[1:36:53] the
[1:36:54] earth and they tried to draw him out of
[1:36:57] their circle,
[1:37:01] say you don't believe it the way I
[1:37:02] believe
[1:37:04] it. Therefore, I'm drawing you out of my
[1:37:12] circle. Brother Brandham said, "I'm
[1:37:14] going to just draw a bigger
[1:37:18] circle and I'm going to draw you right
[1:37:20] back into my
[1:37:24] circle." That's brotherly kindness.
[1:37:28] a loved one for
[1:37:30] another. They might be
[1:37:32] wrong. They might be off the word,
[1:37:36] but your heart
[1:37:38] hungers. But they would come back to the
[1:37:43] fold. Don't stay away,
[1:37:46] brother. Just come back into Christ.
[1:37:53] Amen.
[1:38:00] and to brotherly kindness, charity.
[1:38:07] The stature of a perfect
[1:38:10] man is capped off in charity.
[1:38:19] Love, love and
[1:38:23] action, God's
[1:38:26] love, the power of God working freely
[1:38:29] through
[1:38:32] you to perform his
[1:38:36] word. Not our will but his word.
[1:38:42] All of
[1:38:44] us is died
[1:38:48] out and now is Christ living through
[1:38:53] us. As we quoted
[1:38:56] earlier, Paul said, "I'm crucified with
[1:39:01] Christ. I've died to
[1:39:05] myself. Nevertheless, I
[1:39:08] live. Yet not I, but Christ liveth in
[1:39:13] me. And the life which I now live is in
[1:39:17] the
[1:39:18] flesh. I live by the faith of the son of
[1:39:24] God who loved
[1:39:27] me and gave himself for
[1:39:31] me. Oh, it's not a sacrifice to a
[1:39:34] church,
[1:39:37] but you recognize the love of God for
[1:39:44] you in personal fellowship with
[1:39:49] God in the Leodysian church
[1:39:52] age. Christ is standing on the
[1:39:56] outside knocking on the
[1:39:59] door. Said, "Whosoever will open the
[1:40:03] door, I will come into
[1:40:07] him and will suck with
[1:40:09] him, a personal
[1:40:15] relationship."
[1:40:17] Amen. If these things be in you and
[1:40:24] They make you that you shall be neither
[1:40:26] barren nor unfruitful
[1:40:32] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:40:34] Christ.
[1:40:37] What kind of fruit are we called to
[1:40:41] bear? Say, "Oh, here's where the mighty
[1:40:44] works come in.
[1:40:48] where we're just going to be able to
[1:40:50] speak and it's going to
[1:40:53] happen as much as God
[1:40:58] allows if that's his
[1:41:00] word because we're doing the will of the
[1:41:04] father. Jesus one time stood on the bow
[1:41:07] of the
[1:41:09] ship and said, "Peace be
[1:41:13] still." And the winds and the waves had
[1:41:16] to obey him.
[1:41:20] All things have to come under subjection
[1:41:22] to the word of
[1:41:25] God. And in the line of
[1:41:29] duty, God, there will be some things
[1:41:34] happen. There will be incredible things
[1:41:37] happen. There's incredible things that
[1:41:40] happen in all of our
[1:41:42] lives.
[1:41:44] Miracles, incredible things.
[1:41:48] because those things are following the
[1:41:51] believer because you are doing the will
[1:41:53] of the father.
[1:41:57] But this fruit that you
[1:42:01] bear, the fruit of the
[1:42:04] spirit is love
[1:42:07] and joy and peace,
[1:42:11] longsuffering,
[1:42:14] gentleness, goodness,
[1:42:17] faith, meekness,
[1:42:22] temperance. Against such there is no
[1:42:25] law.
[1:42:28] And they that are Christ have crucified
[1:42:30] the flesh
[1:42:34] with the affections and lusts.
[1:42:42] So this is this is the fruit that we are
[1:42:45] called to bear in
[1:42:50] him in this
[1:42:53] age in the last days. Perilous time
[1:42:56] shall
[1:42:59] come. Men shall be lovers of their own
[1:43:03] selves, truce
[1:43:05] breakers, false
[1:43:08] accusers, despisers of those that are
[1:43:11] good, having a form of
[1:43:14] godliness and denying the power
[1:43:18] thereof. But in the midst of such a
[1:43:20] wicked
[1:43:23] age, in the midst of such a godless
[1:43:27] age, in the midst of such a selfish
[1:43:33] age, you are bearing the fruit of
[1:43:39] love. You're bearing the fruit of joy
[1:43:42] where there is no joy.
[1:43:46] You're bearing the fruit of peace in a
[1:43:48] time when there is no
[1:43:52] peace. You're bearing the fruit of
[1:43:54] longsuffering when everybody is
[1:43:59] impatient. You're bearing the fruit of
[1:44:02] gentleness when everyone else is
[1:44:08] hardened. You're bearing the the the
[1:44:10] fruit of goodness when everybody else is
[1:44:13] looking after themselves.
[1:44:18] You're bearing the fruit of faith when
[1:44:20] all men are turning away from the word
[1:44:22] of
[1:44:26] God. You're bearing the fruit of
[1:44:28] meekness when men are lifted up in
[1:44:34] pride. Bearing the fruit of temperance
[1:44:37] when all men want to just do whatever
[1:44:39] their flesh leads them.
[1:44:46] That's the fruit of the
[1:44:48] spirit to be able to live that kind of a
[1:44:52] life when it looks
[1:44:55] impossible when nobody else is doing
[1:44:59] it. And God looks
[1:45:03] down says, "Have you considered my
[1:45:08] servant?" He's perfect in all his ways.
[1:45:13] a shoe in
[1:45:15] evil. Oh, the devil
[1:45:17] says, "It's because you put a hedge
[1:45:20] around
[1:45:21] him. Oh, let me give him a trial and
[1:45:24] he'll curse you to your
[1:45:27] face. Let me bring sickness. He'll curse
[1:45:29] you to his
[1:45:31] face. Let me take all their possessions.
[1:45:33] He'll curse you to your
[1:45:35] face." God says, "Go ahead and try it.
[1:45:41] put them through some
[1:45:43] suffering because it's only going to
[1:45:45] perform my will in their
[1:45:50] lives. It's just going to perfect a
[1:45:52] Christlike character with
[1:45:57] me. And once that that character is
[1:46:00] perfected through
[1:46:03] suffering, then they are fit to rule.
[1:46:09] Then the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:46:10] will
[1:46:13] come. Then judgments can come upon the
[1:46:16] earth. Then the righteous can walk on
[1:46:19] the ashes of the
[1:46:22] w. Then my sons and
[1:46:25] daughters can rule and reign with me for
[1:46:33] thy. Amen.
[1:46:35] Wherefore the brethren, give
[1:46:40] diligence to make your calling and
[1:46:43] election
[1:46:48] sure. For if you do these
[1:46:52] things, you shall never
[1:46:56] fall. Praise the Lord. That's the word
[1:46:59] of God.
[1:47:02] He will bring us to a place
[1:47:06] where we will not be deceived.
[1:47:10] Eve was deceived.
[1:47:13] But God will bring his bride to a
[1:47:16] place where she cannot be
[1:47:21] deceived by the molding of his holy
[1:47:24] spirit.
[1:47:27] That's his will
[1:47:30] that you would come to a place of
[1:47:31] maturity
[1:47:34] where you will not be deceived.
[1:47:40] For so an
[1:47:43] entrance shall be ministered unto
[1:47:51] you abundantly.
[1:47:58] Uganda.
[1:48:22] Verse uh verse verse 11. Verse 11.
[1:48:25] Readers. Oh yeah. Yeah. I've read verse
[1:48:26] 10. Okay. I'll read verse 11. For so an
[1:48:29] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[1:48:32] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[1:48:35] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:48:48] All of these things that God is doing,
[1:48:54] building your
[1:48:56] character to be like pure
[1:49:00] gold, partakers of his divine
[1:49:06] nature, molding you into the perfection
[1:49:09] of
[1:49:11] Christ that we would only do the will of
[1:49:14] God.
[1:49:17] It will it will minister an entrance
[1:49:20] into his
[1:49:24] kingdom. Jesus said the kingdom of
[1:49:26] heaven's within you.
[1:49:30] The kingdom of heaven doesn't come with
[1:49:34] observation, but it comes from the
[1:49:37] inside
[1:49:40] out. God working from the inside.
[1:49:46] building his
[1:49:48] kingdom. His kingdom is his
[1:49:52] people, his sons and
[1:49:55] daughters. His kingdom is perfect
[1:49:59] harmony. God man
[1:50:02] one that we might once again walk in the
[1:50:05] cool of the
[1:50:08] evening in the Garden of Eden.
[1:50:12] So he he's he's bringing this molding in
[1:50:15] our
[1:50:17] lives so that we can enter into the
[1:50:20] fullness of this
[1:50:23] kingdom in in our hearts is the Holy
[1:50:27] Spirit which is the earnest of our
[1:50:32] inheritance. It's the down payment for
[1:50:34] our
[1:50:36] inheritance. The down payment for all
[1:50:39] that belongs to us.
[1:50:43] But God doesn't want to just give you
[1:50:44] the down
[1:50:49] payment. God wants to give you
[1:50:53] everything. So he is preparing
[1:50:57] you so that you can receive
[1:51:02] everything because it's your
[1:51:05] inheritance. It belongs to you.
[1:51:09] So as we quoted earlier,
[1:51:12] he says it's it's not this outside see,
[1:51:15] taste, feel, smell, and
[1:51:21] hear. He says that's subject to death
[1:51:23] and it will
[1:51:25] die. But the inside part of
[1:51:31] you, that person cannot die.
[1:51:36] And that's the person the new life
[1:51:38] starts
[1:51:41] from from this new
[1:51:44] birth. Builds another person in the
[1:51:47] image of this person you
[1:51:50] are around that
[1:51:54] life. So potentially it's in
[1:51:59] here. And what is it?
[1:52:02] The word promised before the foundation
[1:52:04] of the
[1:52:07] world and around there this only
[1:52:10] reflects the
[1:52:16] negative but
[1:52:18] that will reflect the
[1:52:22] positive the word.
[1:52:25] Then he
[1:52:26] says the translation of the bride will
[1:52:30] be the same
[1:52:35] thing. He says the word that's in
[1:52:40] you will material the the body will
[1:52:44] materialize around that word.
[1:52:52] So God wants you to receive the fullness
[1:52:54] of who you
[1:52:57] are. He's molding
[1:53:00] you. He's preparing you for that
[1:53:05] day. The fullness of
[1:53:09] adoption. You've not received the spirit
[1:53:12] of a bondage of bondage again to
[1:53:16] fear but you've received the spirit of
[1:53:18] adoption whereby we cry aba
[1:53:24] father. So we are looking for the
[1:53:27] fullness of the do of
[1:53:31] adoption the completing of God's
[1:53:36] plan. Paul says in Romans
[1:53:40] 8, which is the redemption of our mortal
[1:53:47] bodies, so when God has completed the
[1:53:50] work on the
[1:53:52] inside, that same word that transformed
[1:53:56] the inside
[1:53:59] man will also transform the outside man.
[1:54:06] the word that's in you.
[1:54:10] We're not waiting for another message.
[1:54:14] We're not waiting for another
[1:54:17] messenger. We're not waiting for more
[1:54:21] mysteries. But the word is in
[1:54:24] you. The word is in the
[1:54:27] bride. And she's patiently
[1:54:31] waiting because it's not her word.
[1:54:35] It's not her finishing the work.
[1:54:40] He's the one that started the
[1:54:42] work and he will finish the
[1:54:47] work and and when he's done working on
[1:54:51] the
[1:54:53] inside, then he's ready to finish the
[1:54:58] work. Then these bodies will be changed.
[1:55:04] We worry so much about this body.
[1:55:09] That's all man wants to worry about this
[1:55:11] in these days.
[1:55:15] They say in
[1:55:17] America they say if you want to get
[1:55:21] rich then write a book, write a diet
[1:55:28] book, write an exercise book.
[1:55:34] exercise. Why? Because everybody wants
[1:55:36] to look after this
[1:55:41] body. Everybody wants to make a perfect
[1:55:46] flesh. So, everybody's looking for that
[1:55:51] way and they're searching through all
[1:55:53] these different
[1:55:56] ways. And one says, "You you need to
[1:55:59] only eat meat.
[1:56:02] Oh, okay. I'll only eat
[1:56:04] meat. But then another one comes along
[1:56:06] and says, "You you need to only eat
[1:56:11] vegetables." Oh, okay. I'll only eat,
[1:56:16] but that doesn't
[1:56:17] work. Oh, well, another one says, "You
[1:56:20] need to eat those vegetables
[1:56:23] cooked." Oh, that's the
[1:56:26] problem. Another one says, "No, you need
[1:56:28] to eat the vegetables raw.
[1:56:33] And another one says, "No, you need to
[1:56:35] take
[1:56:39] vitamins." And another one says, "No,
[1:56:41] no, no. You need to take
[1:56:46] minerals." Another one says, "No, no,
[1:56:48] no. We have modern science
[1:56:52] today. You need to take these pills that
[1:56:54] will make for you."
[1:56:59] And another one says, "No, no, those
[1:57:00] pills are no good for
[1:57:02] you. You need to take only natural
[1:57:07] things." Oh, and we struggle so hard to
[1:57:09] figure it
[1:57:11] out. Another one says, "Oh, you're just
[1:57:14] not exercising
[1:57:17] enough." You need to go to the gym and
[1:57:19] lift.
[1:57:23] Oh, no. Another one says, "You just need
[1:57:25] to do yoga.
[1:57:31] Oh, no. Another one says you need to
[1:57:33] ride your
[1:57:35] bicycle. That'll give you a perfect
[1:57:39] body. Another one says, "No, no, you
[1:57:41] need to play
[1:57:43] sports. You need to swim in the swimming
[1:57:47] pool." All of these different
[1:57:50] ideas on how to perfect this
[1:57:54] body. But God doesn't have an exercise
[1:57:59] program for this natural
[1:58:02] body. He doesn't have a diet program for
[1:58:05] this natural
[1:58:08] body. But God spends all his time on the
[1:58:12] inside
[1:58:19] man to make you just like
[1:58:23] Christ. And when that day
[1:58:26] comes, then God pulls out his exercise
[1:58:33] program. He says, "Now you're ready for
[1:58:36] a perfect
[1:58:39] body." And how how long does that
[1:58:42] exercise program take?
[1:58:46] The Bible says in a
[1:58:49] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:58:53] we shall all be changed.
[1:58:58] Amen. And what what's the purpose that
[1:59:00] we receive this change of our bodies?
[1:59:04] Because corruption cannot inherit
[1:59:11] incorruption because God wants to give
[1:59:13] you
[1:59:15] everything. So when you are ready to
[1:59:18] receive
[1:59:19] everything, when you're ready to receive
[1:59:22] that which is
[1:59:25] incorruptible, this flesh body is no
[1:59:28] longer good enough.
[1:59:32] This mortal body is just a
[1:59:36] tool. God has been using it to mold
[1:59:42] us, using it to bring the inner man in
[1:59:45] line with the
[1:59:49] word. Now God is done using the
[1:59:54] tool and he lays it back in the tool
[1:59:57] box.
[2:00:01] and gives you a new
[2:00:03] body in the moment, in a twinkling of an
[2:00:09] eye. The Bible says, "If this earthly
[2:00:11] tabernacle be
[2:00:15] dissolved, we have another one waiting
[2:00:18] for
[2:00:20] us." Jesus said, "I'm going to prepare a
[2:00:23] place for you.
[2:00:29] Oh, let me just read that
[2:00:31] as we're closing
[2:00:47] John 14.
[2:00:52] In my father's house are all let's start
[2:00:55] at verse one. Let not your heart be
[2:00:58] troubled. You believe in God, believe
[2:01:00] also in me.
[2:01:06] Oh, have you believed in him?
[2:01:10] In my father's house are many
[2:01:15] mansions. If it were not so, I would
[2:01:18] have told you.
[2:01:22] The word of God is always true.
[2:01:26] He doesn't tell us stories to try to
[2:01:28] make us
[2:01:31] happy. But he always tells us the
[2:01:35] truth. He says, "If there wasn't many
[2:01:37] mansions, I would have told
[2:01:40] you. But in my father's house are many
[2:01:45] mansions. And I go to prepare a place
[2:01:48] for you.
[2:01:50] And if I go and prepare a place for
[2:01:54] you, I will come
[2:01:57] again and receive you to myself.
[2:02:01] That where I am, there you may
[2:02:05] be. Whether I go, you know, and the way
[2:02:09] you know.
[2:02:12] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:02:14] He said, "At that day,
[2:02:18] in that day you shall
[2:02:20] know that I am in the
[2:02:24] father and that you are in
[2:02:27] me and I am in you."
[2:02:32] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:34] He He has gone to prepare a place for
[2:02:37] us.
[2:02:40] It doesn't do any good to build somebody
[2:02:42] a home.
[2:02:46] if they're never going to live in
[2:02:49] it. But he went to prepare place for us,
[2:02:54] a home for
[2:02:58] us because he always intended to come
[2:03:02] back and receive us.
[2:03:09] We have a home.
[2:03:11] We have a place that we can call home.
[2:03:16] A place where we can rest.
[2:03:20] A seat at the
[2:03:22] table at the marriage supper of the
[2:03:27] lamb. And it doesn't have anybody else's
[2:03:30] name on it.
[2:03:34] It's not a house that was built for
[2:03:36] somebody
[2:03:38] else and then they never showed up. So
[2:03:40] God's going to give it to
[2:03:44] you. You're not going to wake up in a
[2:03:46] new
[2:03:49] body and look down at
[2:03:52] yourself and say, "Who is
[2:03:55] this? I don't recognize this
[2:03:58] body. I don't feel comfortable in this
[2:04:03] body. I wonder who this was made for."
[2:04:08] But no, he went to prepare a place
[2:04:10] especially for
[2:04:13] you. It's got your name on
[2:04:17] it. And it's reserved in heaven for
[2:04:22] you. It has a reserve sign sitting on
[2:04:25] it.
[2:04:29] A reserved sign
[2:04:33] say like in front of your
[2:04:35] banks says this this parking is only for
[2:04:39] the bank of
[2:04:44] Bara chair in heaven with with a sign on
[2:04:49] it says says Steven Abali
[2:04:55] or whatever your name might be.
[2:04:59] sitting on
[2:05:01] there. Somebody else comes to try to sit
[2:05:03] in that
[2:05:05] chair. You can't sit there. That's your
[2:05:09] name.
[2:05:11] We're waiting for brother Stevenali to
[2:05:14] come fill this chair.
[2:05:17] That's his
[2:05:18] chair. We're waiting for brother Wilson
[2:05:20] Sea to come fill it.
[2:05:24] This one's got his name on it.
[2:05:27] Nobody else can take your
[2:05:30] place. You spell your name on it.
[2:05:36] The word that's in
[2:05:39] you, the body will materialize around
[2:05:43] that
[2:05:48] word. Give
[2:05:51] diligence to make your calling an
[2:05:53] election.
[2:05:56] For so an entrance shall be ministered
[2:06:02] unto the kingdom of
[2:06:04] God. God bless his
[2:06:14] saints. Hallelujah.
[2:06:23] Gazena, we thank you so much, brother
[2:06:26] Steven. God bless you. Let us clap for
[2:06:27] him.
[2:06:34] We want to appreciate you for
[2:06:40] laboring. The word has been rich.
[2:06:44] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:50] I don't know whether you saw that your
[2:06:52] seat is there in heaven.
[2:06:56] So it doesn't
[2:06:58] matter whatever the devil tells you that
[2:07:02] you're of this
[2:07:05] earth. Jesus was telling them you are
[2:07:09] from
[2:07:11] beneath me. I'm from above.
[2:07:15] So we should have the same testimony
[2:07:17] with Jesus that we are also from
[2:07:20] above. We are pilgrims and
[2:07:23] strangers. We are just passing through
[2:07:25] this land. We are going to home
[2:07:31] yonder. We are pilgrims and strangers
[2:07:34] wandering through this world.
[2:07:36] Amen.
[2:07:38] Brother Joshua should come and lead us
[2:07:40] in worship.
[2:07:41] Amen.
[2:07:43] So send our greetings the brethren in
[2:07:45] Canada.
[2:07:52] All the pastors here, God bless you.
[2:07:54] Amen. God bless you so much.
[2:08:07] I'm a
[2:08:09] pilgrim and a
[2:08:13] strange wondering through this
[2:08:17] wild sea.
[2:08:21] On my way to that fair
[2:08:26] city. When the saints go
[2:08:33] maring. Oh, when the
