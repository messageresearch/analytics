[1:25] at your feet.
[1:29] [Music]
[1:31] Sweet
[1:32] spirit,
[1:36] sweet
[1:38] [Music]
[1:42] my
[1:44] soul.
[1:46] Everyone, let let him speak to the Lord.
[1:49] Dear Lord Jesus,
[1:52] we thank you for your grace.
[1:55] You've given us
[1:58] to come into your presence, Lord, this
[2:01] evening, Lord Jesus.
[2:04] We are so humbled, Father,
[2:07] that Lord, who are we, Lord Jesus, that
[2:10] we've received the invitation from the
[2:12] eternal one. Loving Jesus,
[2:16] Father, fill us with your goodness.
[2:19] Fill us with the power of the holiness,
[2:22] Lord, that we may worship you in the
[2:24] power and the beauty of your holiness,
[2:26] Lord. Dear loving Jesus,
[2:30] we have nothing to do, Lord Jesus, with
[2:32] holiness. Neither does our works
[2:36] makes us holy. Neither does our
[2:39] ambitions Lord makes us holy people Lord
[2:43] Jesus. But what makes us holy? It is
[2:46] when the spirit of God is upon us.
[2:49] Like who made uh Samson stronger?
[2:53] The scripture says
[2:56] the spirit of our Lord fell upon him.
[2:59] Lord Jesus where you are that's where
[3:02] Lord holiness is. And where you are,
[3:05] Lord, that is where strength is. Lord,
[3:08] as you told Abraham
[3:11] to n from thee, to n from your breast,
[3:14] which is the word of God, it was a sign
[3:17] that you are the God who gives us
[3:19] strength, Lord. Father, sometimes
[3:22] we are beaten to be weak. Sometimes,
[3:25] Lord, we don't feel like we are are
[3:28] moving onward, Lord. But in the name of
[3:31] Jesus, a little a while, Lord Jesus, you
[3:35] give us an grace and you strengthen us,
[3:37] Lord, by the word of God, by the
[3:40] meditations of the scriptures, by the
[3:43] remembering, Lord, of the word, Lord
[3:45] Jesus, which is written, Father. That's
[3:47] why we pray, Father, as you promised us,
[3:51] Lord, that you will never leave us. I
[3:53] pray in the name of Jesus, may you come
[3:56] now and live with us, Lord. May you come
[3:58] and direct our paths Lord. May you come
[4:02] and guide our footsteps Lord. And may
[4:05] you come and lead our decision making
[4:08] father. Sometimes Lord we move quick to
[4:12] the extent that Lord we decide wrongly
[4:16] Father but Lord Jesus forgive us Lord
[4:21] and all all together forgive our
[4:23] shortcoming Lord and Lord Jesus
[4:27] fill us with your love Lord as we
[4:30] approach
[4:31] the coming of our Lord
[4:34] we see nations are breaking Israel Lord
[4:37] they awakening Lord that fig tree is
[4:39] putting parts but Lord Jesus the
[4:43] Gentiles days are numbered and father we
[4:46] see the message is been rejected Lord
[4:50] until it will be uh fulfilled that as
[4:53] Israel rejected the word the same thing
[4:57] is going to happen Lord in the days you
[5:00] know of Gentiles but I pray in the name
[5:03] of Jesus may you seal us Lord with the
[5:06] power of the spirit of God that Lord
[5:08] Jesus you may keep us Lord and you
[5:11] preserve us Lord that Lord we may be
[5:14] father revealed to the last day in the
[5:17] days of that rapturing day Lord when the
[5:20] uh rising saints shall be rising up Lord
[5:24] let our faith Lord may you increase our
[5:26] faith Lord and may our faith stand Lord
[5:29] that Lord Jesus as the Lord looked in
[5:32] time he said will I find faith I pray in
[5:35] the name of Jesus may you Lord keep our
[5:38] faith in the name of Jesus as you kept
[5:41] the faith Lord of William Marion Brham
[5:44] in the times Lord when his life was
[5:47] almost
[5:48] disorganized Lord and he had nothing to
[5:51] do Lord but he promis he said the faith
[5:55] kept him Lord so Lord Jesus may you keep
[5:58] our faith Lord that we may stand Lord
[6:01] sure and confidence Lord oh precious
[6:04] heavenly father
[6:06] we are yours Lord as you've chosen in us
[6:08] Lord. May you sustain our lives Lord
[6:11] spiritually Lord and may you make our
[6:14] lives to live worth of this gospel Lord.
[6:17] Father Lord Jesus without this gospel
[6:19] there is nothing Lord we can cling unto
[6:22] Lord. Without this way Lord the other
[6:25] way Lord Jesus is the way of destruction
[6:28] Lord. However much it is straight.
[6:30] However much Lord it is so squeezed Lord
[6:33] and few are choose it Lord or find it. I
[6:37] pray Lord Jesus may these few people
[6:39] Lord
[6:41] maintain their walk in this way Lord
[6:43] Jesus as the prophet says we stay in the
[6:46] way we stay in the white line we stay
[6:50] straight with the word of God father
[6:52] Lord if we've gone short of your glory
[6:55] if we've gone short of your word if
[6:57] there is some little unbelief in the
[6:59] hearts Lord may you melt it Lord and
[7:02] forgive us Lord that we may come back
[7:05] Lord that we may really Father esteem
[7:07] your word more precious Lord that as
[7:10] Moses Lord esteem the reproach of Christ
[7:13] more than the riches of the world.
[7:16] Father I pray in the name of Jesus may
[7:18] you make us one of you know your
[7:20] servants. May you make us one of your
[7:22] children. May you make us uh obedient
[7:25] Lord
[7:27] to your word. We thank you Jesus. I
[7:29] commit your ser the service into your
[7:31] hands and I commit father your children
[7:34] as they have come to hear the word. May
[7:37] you Lord Jesus Christ give them grace
[7:39] and uh revelation Lord that Lord
[7:43] whatever the minister is going to preach
[7:45] the pastor Lord let it come inside of
[7:48] our hearts Lord inside of our souls
[7:51] father Lord Jesus that it may find a
[7:53] bedding ground Lord that when the water
[7:55] comes the waters of the rains of the
[7:59] Holy Spirit let it find a seed in there
[8:02] Lord that Lord in due time that seed is
[8:06] going to Jatiz Lord we appreciate we
[8:08] appreciate you Lord we give you thanks
[8:10] and glory in the mighty name Lord God of
[8:13] our Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen Lord

[16:40] I will come to thee. Amen. Praise the
[16:47] name of our Lord. We thank God for this
[16:50] opportunity of being again in his
[16:51] presence.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[16:55] Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[16:57] Christ,
[16:59] we want to thank you so much, Lord,
[17:02] for the privilege that you've given unto
[17:04] us that we can come into your presence,
[17:07] Lord, and you promised us that where two
[17:11] or three are gathered in your name,
[17:14] you will be there in their midst. And
[17:17] so, we believe you are here, Lord. You
[17:20] also promised us that they shall be
[17:23] taught of the Lord
[17:25] and great shall be their peace.
[17:28] May you teach us heavenly father
[17:31] that in such troubleous times
[17:34] we can have an anchor holding
[17:38] and be ready for the rapture that will
[17:39] happen.
[17:41] We bring all our burdens and needs into
[17:44] your hands.
[17:46] Praying that lord may have preeminence
[17:48] father.
[17:50] and reveal yourself to us and show us
[17:53] the path that we have to take
[17:57] and heal the sick in our midst.
[18:00] Deliver the captives Father
[18:02] and grant grace to every one of us
[18:05] as we walk in this journey. We love you
[18:08] Lord and we thank you.
[18:11] Bless us with your word
[18:13] revealing yourself to us father in the
[18:16] name of the Lord Jesus.
[18:20] Amen.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Let us go to our Bibles.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; We're reading in the book of Deuteronomy
[18:30] from verse one to verse 6.
[18:37] Deuteronomy chapter
[18:39] 8 from verse one to verse 6.
[18:46] So the Bible says, "All the commandments
[18:50] which I command thee this day shall you
[18:53] observe to do that you may live and
[18:57] multiply and go in and possess the land
[19:02] which the Lord swear unto your fathers."
[19:09] And thou shalt remember all the way
[19:11] which the Lord thy God led thee these 40
[19:15] years in the wilderness to humble thee
[19:19] and to prove thee to
[19:22] know what was in thine heart whether th
[19:26] would keep his commandments or not.
[19:34] for
[19:43] [Music]
[20:18] And he humbled thee, and suffered thee
[20:20] to hunger, and feed thee with mana which
[20:23] thou knowest not. Neither did thy
[20:25] fathers know that he might make thee
[20:29] know that man does not live by bread
[20:32] alone, but by everyone that proceeds out
[20:36] of the mouth of the Lord does man live.
[21:06] Thy remarks not old upon thee, neither
[21:10] did thy foot swell these 40 years.
[21:16] So
[21:23] thou shalt also consider in thine heart
[21:26] that as man chastises his son, so the
[21:29] Lord thy God chastises thee.
[21:50] Therefore, you shall keep the
[21:52] commandments of the Lord your God, to
[21:55] walk in his ways, and to fear him.
[22:06] May God bless his word. You may be
[22:09] seated.
[22:11] I want to preach on the subject
[22:14] living by the word.
[22:18] Praise the name of our Lord. Living by
[22:20] the word.
[22:23] Now we can just get maybe an
[22:25] understanding
[22:28] that like our natural bodies,
[22:33] they need the natural food
[22:36] to be alive.
[22:39] Praise the name of the Lord. Because
[22:41] like if you don't eat,
[22:44] you'll finally die.
[22:47] Because these bodies,
[22:49] they draw from the natural food.
[22:54] they draw from the natural food,
[22:59] you know, the food which is natural here
[23:01] on earth.
[23:03] And when you look at the scriptures
[23:05] here,
[23:07] when we go to Genesis chapter one,
[23:11] praise the name of our Lord. Then we can
[23:14] take from chapter 1
[23:18] &gt;&gt; and then we read in verse 12 or verse
[23:23] 11.
[23:25] And the Lord said, "Let the earth bring
[23:27] forth grass and the hub yielding seed,
[23:30] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[23:33] his kind, whose seed is in itself upon
[23:36] the earth." And it was so.
[23:57] Amen. Amen. We want to receive our
[23:59] pastor back.
[24:01] Thank God he granted himself covering
[24:03] mercies.
[24:05] So now when God wanted plants,
[24:09] he commanded the earth to bring the
[24:11] plants,
[24:14] you know, the trees,
[24:17] you know, the grass,
[24:19] &gt;&gt; the crops and everything.
[24:22] And now as the earth brought forth those
[24:25] plants,
[24:28] you'll find that for the plant to be
[24:31] alive,
[24:35] It will need to be from feeding from the
[24:38] source where it came from
[24:43] because the plants came from the earth
[24:48] and even it is food
[24:51] is on the earth
[24:54] you know. So they have to draw their
[24:55] livelihood from the earth
[24:58] [Music]
[25:00] where they came from.
[25:03] But now if you say okay I want this
[25:04] plant so much
[25:08] maybe like a flower and then you say
[25:11] okay I want I want this flower.
[25:14] I'm going to hang it in my sitting room
[25:22] because I love it.
[25:24] you're already killing it because if it
[25:27] is not attached from on the earth where
[25:29] it came from
[25:33] is going to perish.
[25:36] It is the same thing also here
[25:39] when God wanted fish
[25:43] in Genesis chapter one. And then in
[25:47] verse 20,
[25:50] he says, "And God said, let the waters
[25:52] bring forth abundantly the moving
[25:55] creature that has life and fall that may
[25:57] fly above earth upon the firmament of
[26:00] heaven.
[26:13] And God created the wells and every
[26:15] living creature that moveth which the
[26:18] waters brought forth abundantly after
[26:21] their kind, and every winged fall after
[26:23] his kind. And God saw that it was good.
[26:46] praise the name of the Lord. So now when
[26:48] God wanted the fish,
[26:51] he spoke to the waters
[26:53] on the earth. And when he wanted the
[26:56] birds,
[26:58] you know, he talked to the waters in the
[27:00] in the space
[27:03] and then the water brought forth birds.
[27:07] Then the oceans brought forth fish.
[27:12] And so you find that for a fish to be
[27:15] alive,
[27:17] it will need to live in the waters
[27:22] because that's where it came from.
[27:25] Praise the name of the Lord. But if you
[27:27] remove the fish from the water,
[27:30] you are killing it. The same thing with
[27:33] animals. Now,
[27:35] when God wanted animals,
[27:39] he said in verse 24,
[27:42] and the Lord said, "Let the earth bring
[27:44] forth the living creature after his
[27:46] kind,
[27:48] [Music]
[27:51] cattle and creeping things,
[27:54] and the beast of the earth after his
[27:56] kind.
[27:58] And it was so.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; So the animals
[28:03] had to come from the earth.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; So even their livelihood,
[28:10] they get their food from the earth.
[28:14] Praise the name of our Lord. So they
[28:16] live by the earth.
[28:19] Now when you turn around to man,
[28:23] when God wanted fish,
[28:27] it spoke to the waters.
[28:30] When God wanted animals,
[28:32] he spoke to the earth. When God wanted
[28:36] plants,
[28:38] he spoke to the earth. But now when God
[28:41] wanted man,
[28:44] whom did he speak to?
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. When God
[28:49] wanted man,
[28:51] he spoke to himself.
[28:54] Let us make man in our image.
[28:58] Now we see that as the fish cannot live
[29:01] without the waters.
[29:05] The plants cannot live without the
[29:07] earth.
[29:10] The animals cannot live without the
[29:12] earth.
[29:15] So even man cannot live without God.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Man came
[29:24] from God.
[29:26] So the livelihood of man
[29:29] is drawn from God.
[29:32] That's why he said man cannot live by
[29:35] bread alone
[29:38] but only the word of God.
[29:42] Now to live by the word of God
[29:46] means that the word of God
[29:50] guides your path
[29:53] all the way.
[29:55] It guides your decision making.
[30:00] It guides your speech.
[30:03] It guides your action.
[30:07] Whether you at home,
[30:09] let the word take charge over everything
[30:12] you do
[30:14] or you are at a place of work, let the
[30:18] word take charge over everything you do.
[30:22] And that's how you can live by the word
[30:25] of God,
[30:28] implying that every decision you make
[30:32] is based upon what the word of God says.
[30:38] You know in the circumstances that you
[30:41] are in
[30:43] in the message God's provided way of
[30:46] healing.
[30:49] Brother Brandham says so I am a
[30:52] fundamental believer in the Bible.
[30:56] [Music]
[30:57] what the Bible says.
[31:00] I believe it
[31:02] and I believe it is the truth
[31:05] and ready to hang my soul
[31:11] on any phrase of the Bible,
[31:15] on any sentence of the Bible,
[31:22] whatever it might be
[31:26] that God's word
[31:29] is everlasting truth.
[31:33] It is inspired
[31:36] and written
[31:39] and we stay with it.
[31:43] Praise the name of our Lord. He says
[31:45] he's ready to hang his soul
[31:49] on what the Bible says.
[31:53] So now you are allowing the Bible
[31:57] to influence your life in everything.
[32:00] [Music]
[32:02] So then in every walk you walk,
[32:06] you have faith in the word of God,
[32:10] praise the name of our Lord. So now
[32:12] Moses was telling the children of Israel
[32:16] in Deuteronomy chapter 8
[32:19] that God led you these 40 years
[32:25] [Music]
[32:27] and his desire for you
[32:31] is that you observe all the commandments
[32:34] of God
[32:37] that you may live.
[32:40] Praise the name of our Lord. living by
[32:42] the word of God.
[32:45] So to live by the word of God
[32:50] that means that you obey the word of God
[32:55] in every instance
[32:59] not on some.
[33:02] Praise the name of our Lord. God told
[33:05] Timothy,
[33:07] "Praise the name of our Lord. Take the
[33:10] word of God
[33:13] without partiality,
[33:16] you know, taking only what you want and
[33:19] leaving what you don't want.
[33:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[33:27] to first 5:21.
[33:34] 1 Timothy chapter 5
[33:39] verse 21.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; It says, "I charge thee before God and
[33:45] the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect
[33:47] angels that though observe these things
[33:51] without preferring one before another,
[33:55] doing nothing by partiality.
[34:17] you know without taking this that I
[34:19] would take this and then I would reject
[34:21] this.
[34:24] If you take the word of God
[34:28] like when Paul was telling the king,
[34:32] I was not disobedient to the heavenly
[34:34] vision,
[34:38] but I've declared unto you the whole
[34:40] council of God.
[34:45] And that's how we need to receive the
[34:47] word of God.
[34:49] Take it with all your heart,
[34:53] all your mind.
[34:55] And then the word influences your
[34:57] lifestyle.
[35:00] The word determines your decision.
[35:04] It's what guides you.
[35:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Because the
[35:10] word of God is described in the
[35:13] scriptures
[35:15] in different forms.
[35:17] Like in the book of Psalms, the Bible
[35:20] says that the word of God
[35:24] is a lamp unto my feet.
[35:28] And you need a lamp when you are making
[35:31] one step at a time.
[35:35] You know when you are moving step by
[35:37] step
[35:41] because you need to see where you're
[35:42] putting the next step.
[35:47] So it helps you on your daily walk.
[35:52] It helps you the decisions you make in
[35:54] the morning.
[35:57] It should influence your decision at the
[35:59] beginning of the journey.
[36:04] The small things that you do.
[36:08] You know the small things you get
[36:10] involved in,
[36:13] the light things you take charge of
[36:19] one step at a time.
[36:21] That's a lamp.
[36:24] You know, it helps you to see where you
[36:25] are
[36:27] so that you can make the next step.
[36:31] But the word does not only stop at being
[36:34] a lamp,
[36:37] but the word of God still.
[36:41] The Bible says it is a light,
[36:45] you know, a light unto my path.
[36:49] In other words, it shows you where your
[36:51] destination is,
[36:54] where you are going.
[36:57] So you are seeing your destiny.
[37:00] It may be hundreds of miles.
[37:03] It may be a 100 years ahead.
[37:07] Praise the name of the Lord. And
[37:09] sometimes you can make a decision today
[37:13] that can affect you the rest of your
[37:15] life.
[37:17] So the word of God
[37:20] has got the ability
[37:22] to guide you in making a longlasting
[37:26] decision
[37:29] that you'll appreciate even when you are
[37:31] old.
[37:32] I said Lord I thank you. I accepted the
[37:36] Lord Jesus as my personal savior
[37:39] when I was still young.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; So you don't regret about middle life
[37:43] crisis.
[37:50] Because you made the wrong decision of
[37:52] you made the right decision of marriage.
[37:57] You made the right decision of accepting
[37:58] the Lord Jesus as your personal savior.
[38:02] You made the right decision of who your
[38:05] friends are.
[38:08] You made the right decision of the kind
[38:10] of work you're going to do.
[38:14] Long-term impacts.
[38:18] So the word of God is a light unto my
[38:21] path
[38:24] so I can see my destination.
[38:27] Praise the name of our Lord. So now
[38:29] again the Bible expresses the word of
[38:32] God
[38:34] not only as the light
[38:38] or not only as the lamp
[38:41] but then the Bible again guides shows
[38:44] the word of God.
[38:47] as the living water.
[38:50] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[38:52] shows the word of God
[38:55] as the living bread.
[38:58] You know, it shows the everything.
[39:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Why?
[39:05] Because the word of God
[39:08] is God himself.
[39:10] Praise the name of our Lord. God
[39:13] himself.
[39:16] Now in this in the message the great
[39:19] greater than Solomon is here
[39:23] &gt;&gt; he says you know there is something
[39:26] about it
[39:29] man knows that he come from somewhere
[39:34] and he is here
[39:38] and he don't know why he is here
[39:42] and he is going somewhere Yeah.
[39:46] And he doesn't know where he is going.
[39:51] And there is only one book in the world
[39:56] that tells us,
[39:58] who we are,
[40:00] where you come from,
[40:03] what you are,
[40:05] and where you are going.
[40:08] And that is the Bible.
[40:11] It's the only one.
[40:14] That tells you
[40:16] and it is God's book
[40:19] it is God himself
[40:22] manifested in word form
[40:28] called a seed.
[40:30] That seed in the right kind of ground
[40:36] will produce every promise that he made
[40:42] because it is God himself.
[40:46] But it has to be watered by faith
[40:53] to make it come to pass
[40:57] like any other seed.
[40:59] Praise the name of our Lord. So now when
[41:02] you receive the word of God, when you
[41:05] hear the word of God, you must have
[41:08] faith in the word.
[41:11] Praise the name of our Lord because the
[41:13] Bible tells us without faith. It is
[41:17] impossible to please God.
[41:20] And faith comes
[41:22] by hearing of the word. So now the more
[41:26] you hear the word of God,
[41:28] it builds your faith.
[41:31] You know, you believe in that same word
[41:34] and then as you believe that word,
[41:38] it influences you,
[41:41] the word becomes flesh in you
[41:44] so that you become the manifestation
[41:49] of the word of God.
[41:51] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[41:54] message Christ is the mystery of God
[41:55] revealed.
[41:58] He says he is the thing.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; He was the prophets.
[42:05] He was in them. He was in the psalms.
[42:10] He was in the history
[42:12] and he is the things to come.
[42:16] The same yesterday, today and forever.
[42:21] Hebrews 13:8
[42:24] he should be then he should be the
[42:27] principle
[42:28] [Music]
[42:30] if that is he is
[42:33] and we believe then if he is that then
[42:38] he should be the principal theme of our
[42:41] talking
[42:45] of our thinking
[42:48] of our singing
[42:51] So he says Christ should be the
[42:54] principal theme
[42:57] of our talking.
[43:00] He should be the principal theme
[43:02] of our thinking.
[43:04] It should be the principal theme of our
[43:08] singing.
[43:10] It should be the principal theme
[43:13] of our works.
[43:15] Praise the name of our Lord. So it is
[43:18] Christ
[43:20] in my talking.
[43:22] It's Christ I'm exalting
[43:25] in my thinking.
[43:27] It is Christ I'm exalting
[43:30] in my singing.
[43:33] It is Christ I'm exalting
[43:35] in my walking.
[43:38] It is Christ I'm exalting.
[43:41] It should be the principal theme of our
[43:43] life.
[43:45] If is the principal theme of the Bible
[43:50] and the Bible is in us
[43:54] then he should be the principal theme of
[43:57] everything.
[44:01] Everything that we do
[44:04] that we say
[44:06] or think
[44:08] should be Christ.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Christ is
[44:13] the word of God.
[44:16] So then you are living by the word.
[44:20] You are depending upon God.
[44:24] All your life.
[44:26] You know your your decision making.
[44:29] Your walking.
[44:32] Praise the name of the Lord should be
[44:33] based on Christ.
[44:36] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[44:38] to Matthew chapter 4.
[44:42] And then we start reading from verse
[44:44] one.
[44:47] The Bible says, "Then was Jesus led up
[44:51] of the spirit into the wilderness to be
[44:54] tempted of the devil.
[45:03] And when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[45:05] nights, he was afterward and hungered.
[45:12] [Music]
[45:15] And when the tempter came to him, he
[45:17] said, "If thou be the son of God,
[45:20] command that these stones be made bread.
[45:32] Now the devil always comes to tempt us
[45:37] and the purpose of Satan
[45:40] that he can take you from the word of
[45:42] God.
[45:44] That's the main purpose of Satan.
[45:48] When he came to Eve in the garden,
[45:51] it was to make her
[45:54] turn away from the tree of life
[45:58] and focus on the tree of knowledge of
[46:00] good and evil.
[46:03] Satan that's how he keeps on playing.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; So now he finds Christ hungry
[46:10] and then he tells him there are stones
[46:12] here.
[46:13] Why don't you make them break
[46:16] to take his attention
[46:19] and put him to the natural things
[46:23] and that's what the devil does all the
[46:25] time.
[46:27] But Jesus answered and said, "It is
[46:30] written,
[46:31] man shall not live by bread alone,
[46:38] but by every word
[46:41] that proceeds out of the mouth of God,
[46:46] you know, because he tested him on the
[46:48] basic things.
[46:52] What do you live by?
[46:54] Praise the name of our Lord." And we can
[46:56] also find out ourselves.
[46:59] What do we live by?
[47:02] When you are in trouble,
[47:04] what is your immediate reaction when you
[47:06] get into trouble?
[47:10] When you fall sick, what is your first
[47:13] action?
[47:15] Where is my insurance card? Insurance?
[47:18] How much money do I have? Can we run to
[47:21] the hospital?
[47:23] Can I move in time? Which hospital am I
[47:26] going to?
[47:28] What is your first reaction?
[47:34] Do you think about God as the healer?
[47:38] And then you say, Lord,
[47:40] I am sick.
[47:42] But you say it,
[47:44] &gt;&gt; by your stripes we are healed.
[47:47] Praise the name of our Lord. That's why
[47:49] you should start from.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:52] That's what you should start by
[47:56] in any kind of situation you get into
[48:00] first acknowledge God.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says in in
[48:06] Proverbs chapter 3. I think we can go
[48:08] there.
[48:10] Proverbs chapter 3
[48:14] and then we read in
[48:17] verse 4.
[48:19] Proverbs chapter 3
[48:22] and then
[48:24] we read verse 6.
[48:29] Let us start from verse five.
[48:32] The Bible says, "Trust in the Lord
[48:36] with all thine heart."
[48:43] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible is telling us.
[48:45] with all your heart
[48:48] trust in the Lord and lean not on thy
[48:52] own understanding
[48:58] in all thy ways.
[49:03] Acknowledge God
[49:06] and he shall direct your paths.
[49:11] That's where you start from.
[49:14] If any trouble comes in,
[49:17] bring God on board.
[49:20] Lord, this is the situation I'm going
[49:22] in.
[49:23] Lord, this is the trouble I'm going in.
[49:26] Lord, I call upon your name.
[49:29] So, you are depending upon God.
[49:32] You are not looking at the money you
[49:34] have.
[49:36] You're not looking at the friends you
[49:37] have. You are not looking at the family
[49:40] you have. not looking at the systems
[49:43] you've put in place
[49:47] like now maybe you hear thieves outside
[49:51] then you say is this camera working
[49:53] about this one here is the dog awake is
[49:56] the alarm awake
[50:00] first call upon the name of the Lord
[50:03] because the Bible says that the watchman
[50:08] watches in vain
[50:11] If the Lord does not watch over the
[50:13] city.
[50:14] So you commit everything into the hands
[50:17] of God
[50:19] and say, "Lord, I'm hearing this. Lord,
[50:22] there is this trouble. Lord, there is
[50:25] terrible headache I'm feeling.
[50:27] Lord, there is a trouble that has
[50:29] befallen us.
[50:32] Come and take charge over this."
[50:35] That's where you start from. And then
[50:38] the Bible says then God from there
[50:42] he will guide your steps.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. He will
[50:48] direct your paths.
[50:52] Then you can say ah I'm attacked by
[50:54] thieves. I'm committed to the Lord in
[50:57] prayer.
[50:58] Then you can say oh do I have police
[51:00] line?
[51:02] Can I call my neighbor?
[51:05] You know the Lord is guiding in
[51:06] everything.
[51:09] The child is very sick at home.
[51:12] You've laid your hands on the child.
[51:14] Let's pray for the mercies of God. You
[51:17] rebuked that fever.
[51:20] You rebuke that demon. You said, "Lord,
[51:22] deliver my child. Heal my child." Then
[51:26] you can say, "Let me take the child to
[51:27] the hospital."
[51:29] He guides your footsteps.
[51:32] He knows exactly where to go.
[51:36] Praise the name of our Lord. So that's
[51:39] how we live
[51:41] by God
[51:43] depending upon him in everything that we
[51:46] go through.
[51:49] Praise the name of our Lord. You rely on
[51:51] him and say, "Lord, come to my rescue.
[51:56] Lord, I'm troubled here.
[51:59] I can't proceed further.
[52:02] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[52:03] you depend on him. You call upon his
[52:07] name not first taking a a running
[52:12] then when you reach there and you are
[52:13] getting stuck
[52:16] then you start remembering God. Oh God
[52:17] now
[52:20] when time has gone you wasted a lot
[52:26] how to call upon the name of the Lord.
[52:29] Praise the name of our Lord because
[52:31] that's what the Bible tells us that
[52:34] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[52:37] in Romans chapter 10.
[52:40] Romans chapter 10
[52:43] and then we can read in
[52:48] in verse
[52:49] 13,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; whosoever shall call upon the name of
[52:55] the Lord shall be saved.
[53:01] Praise the name of our Lord. Whosoever
[53:03] calls upon his name
[53:06] shall be delivered.
[53:09] God will come down to your rescue.
[53:13] So you are depending upon God. You are
[53:16] living by the word of God.
[53:20] Every scenario you get to.
[53:23] Every challenge that comes along,
[53:26] you call upon the name of the Lord. And
[53:28] this is how Christ lived in the
[53:30] temptation.
[53:33] It was not looking at the the need of
[53:35] the natural food,
[53:41] but he said living by the word of God.
[53:46] So then the devil takes him to another
[53:48] point.
[53:51] Praise the name of our Lord. And the
[53:53] Bible says verse 5 of Mark 4, then the
[53:57] devil takes him up in the holy city and
[54:00] set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
[54:17] and says unto him, "If you be the son of
[54:20] God, cast yourself down. For it is
[54:22] written, he shall give his angels charge
[54:26] concerning you, and in their hands they
[54:29] shall bear you up, lest at any time you
[54:33] dash your foot against a stone.
[54:57] Now see the devil,
[55:00] brother Brham says the devil was
[55:03] quoting.
[55:06] He was not quoting.
[55:09] So he was quoting it
[55:12] so that he presented to you very
[55:14] attractive.
[55:16] God said this
[55:20] like there is an instance I think it was
[55:22] during the time of
[55:26] and then somebody wrote
[55:29] that I will give you all things.
[55:35] He went and took half of the scriptures
[55:37] of Matthew chapter 19.
[55:42] All these things will I give you
[55:46] if you worship me
[55:48] quoting.
[55:50] Then people were responding
[55:53] and this man who was doing the survey
[55:58] he said 97% of the people are saying
[56:02] amen. Amen. Amen.
[56:08] And then he followed some of them were
[56:10] pastors.
[56:12] And then he followed them. Then he was
[56:15] asking whom were you responding to as a
[56:17] man?
[56:20] But this was the devil telling telling
[56:22] Jesus.
[56:26] If you worship me, I'm going to give you
[56:28] all the things. Then you also go and cut
[56:32] half of that scripture.
[56:35] And then you use it and then say, "Amen.
[56:39] I receive this." Amen.
[56:41] Not going back to find out
[56:45] where does this apply.
[56:50] Praise the name of our Lord. What is the
[56:52] application of this?
[56:55] Because the word has a season of
[56:58] application.
[57:01] Praise the name of our Lord. As it is
[57:04] season,
[57:06] there is a time of its fulfillment in a
[57:08] particular condition.
[57:14] So now Satan was tempting Jesus
[57:18] and then Jesus had to go back to the
[57:21] word
[57:23] to make the right application of the
[57:26] word
[57:29] not the way the devil uses the word
[57:32] because Jesus is the word himself
[57:35] and he said don't tempt me Satan
[57:43] praise the name overlord. So we need to
[57:45] learn how to live by the word of God
[57:52] that we live in life.
[57:55] Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us
[57:58] go to Psalms 104
[58:02] and then verse 27.
[58:09] Psalms 104 verse 27.
[58:13] The Bible says
[58:15] &gt;&gt; this wait all upon thee that thou may
[58:19] give them their meat in due season.
[58:27] Praise the name of our Lord. So the word
[58:29] has to be fulfilled in the due season
[58:35] in the season that God has ordained
[58:40] in the plan of God
[58:43] in the mind of God
[58:46] like now when the scripture says
[58:49] in Acts chapter let us first start with
[58:52] Luke 1 verse 20
[58:57] the Bible says
[58:59] And behold, you shall be dumped and not
[59:02] be able to speak until the day that did
[59:05] things shall be performed because you
[59:08] believe not my words which shall be
[59:10] fulfilled in their season.
[59:18] [Music]
[59:27] Now you notice that the word has been
[59:29] given to us.
[59:33] But the word must be fulfilled in his
[59:36] season.
[59:39] The season that God has planned that be
[59:42] fulfilled.
[59:46] And that's why we need the Holy Spirit.
[59:50] Because the Holy Spirit
[59:52] is the giver of the word and he knows
[59:56] when the word has to be fulfilled.
[1:00:00] Like when Simeon was waiting upon the
[1:00:03] consolation of Israel,
[1:00:07] the Bible says the Holy Spirit was upon
[1:00:10] him
[1:00:12] and the Holy Spirit promised him
[1:00:16] that you will not die until you see the
[1:00:19] Lord is Christ.
[1:00:22] So now the Holy Spirit
[1:00:25] gave the promise. It was the word of
[1:00:27] God. The same Holy Spirit
[1:00:31] that gave the promise
[1:00:34] knew the time of fulfillment.
[1:00:37] [Music]
[1:00:39] And now we are living in the time of
[1:00:41] fulfillment
[1:00:44] of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:00:47] Praise the name of the Lord. We are
[1:00:49] living in the season
[1:00:51] for the rapture.
[1:00:53] And so now we have to come back to
[1:00:55] ourselves
[1:00:57] and then find out am I ready for the
[1:01:00] rapture
[1:01:02] because this is the season. These are
[1:01:05] the times of preparation.
[1:01:08] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:01:10] when Jesus Christ was had finished as
[1:01:13] had resurrected,
[1:01:17] the disciples came to him
[1:01:20] in Acts chapter one.
[1:01:23] And then verse six and when they were
[1:01:26] there come together, they asked him of
[1:01:29] saying, Lord, will you at this time
[1:01:33] restore again the kingdom to Israel?
[1:01:45] You know, they desired that time to come
[1:01:47] first.
[1:01:49] They desired the fulfillment of that.
[1:01:53] But then Jesus tells them,
[1:01:56] "It is not for you to know the times or
[1:02:00] the seasons which the father has put in
[1:02:03] his power.
[1:02:16] So they were looking at something
[1:02:20] which was not of their time,
[1:02:23] which was not of their season
[1:02:26] and desired to be fulfilled,
[1:02:30] but he told them, "You shall receive
[1:02:33] power."
[1:02:35] Praise the name of our Lord after the
[1:02:37] Holy Ghost is come upon. He said this is
[1:02:40] what you need now.
[1:02:43] Praise the name of our Lord. That was
[1:02:45] now in the second exodus.
[1:02:49] We are living in the time of the third
[1:02:52] Exodus.
[1:02:54] And the third exodus
[1:02:57] has a fulfillment
[1:03:00] has got its fulfillment
[1:03:04] of the things that God has promised.
[1:03:08] And in this third Exodus, the promise
[1:03:11] that we have is the change of our bodies
[1:03:16] from this mortal bodies to immortality.
[1:03:20] Praise the name of our Lord. where these
[1:03:23] bodies can no more die.
[1:03:26] It is a time to manifest our full
[1:03:29] redemption.
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:33] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:03:35] the Bible tells us that we need to be
[1:03:38] born again of the incorruptible seed
[1:03:45] which is the word of God. And we are
[1:03:47] living in a time where these corruptible
[1:03:50] bodies
[1:03:52] We are going to put on the incorruptible
[1:03:54] bodies.
[1:03:57] Praise the name of our Lord. It's the
[1:03:59] season of fulfillment of this.
[1:04:04] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:04:06] to Luke chapter 21.
[1:04:09] And then we read from verse 29.
[1:04:16] Luke chapter
[1:04:22] Luke chapter 21 29
[1:04:27] the Bible says and he spoke to them a
[1:04:30] parable behold the fig tree and all the
[1:04:32] trees
[1:04:40] and when they now shoot forth you see
[1:04:43] and know of your own selves that summer
[1:04:46] is now at hand.
[1:04:58] So likewise ye, when you see these
[1:05:00] things come to pass, know that the
[1:05:03] kingdom of God is nigh at hand.
[1:05:11] Very
[1:05:16] I say unto you, this generation shall
[1:05:19] not pass away till all be fulfilled.
[1:05:31] Now he's referring to the fig tree
[1:05:35] and brother Brandham tells us the fig
[1:05:37] tree is Israel
[1:05:42] and Israel is our time calendar.
[1:05:47] It shows the time we are living in.
[1:05:51] They are in their homeland.
[1:05:54] You know, you know on Monday I was
[1:05:56] listening to the speeches of their
[1:05:58] leaders when they were hosting the
[1:06:01] president of USA.
[1:06:08] When they when they were talking,
[1:06:11] they speak of parliament,
[1:06:14] you know, he would refer to the
[1:06:16] scriptures
[1:06:18] and then he would pray. Then again the
[1:06:21] prime minister.
[1:06:23] He would also refer to the scriptures.
[1:06:26] Everybody was just about scriptures.
[1:06:31] They were identifying their position.
[1:06:36] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[1:06:37] promises of God were calling upon them.
[1:06:42] A fig tree. They are just ready to
[1:06:45] receive the Messiah.
[1:06:48] But now before they can receive the
[1:06:49] Messiah,
[1:06:51] the rapture has to take place
[1:06:54] because the gospel has to leave the
[1:06:56] Gentiles
[1:06:59] and then go to the Jews.
[1:07:04] Now Jesus says when you see these things
[1:07:07] happen
[1:07:09] praise the name of our Lord know that
[1:07:12] the kingdom of God is very near
[1:07:17] and says this generation shall not pass
[1:07:20] away
[1:07:22] till all be fulfilled.
[1:07:26] Now you look at the emphas.
[1:07:32] Heaven and earth will pass away
[1:07:36] but my words shall not pass away.
[1:07:41] Praise the name of our Lord. And this is
[1:07:43] where we are standing
[1:07:45] that all the word of God has to come to
[1:07:48] pass.
[1:07:50] But now when it comes to ourselves,
[1:07:54] are we ready?
[1:07:57] What our preparations like?
[1:08:00] Are we living by the word of God?
[1:08:04] Verse 34. And take it to yourselves.
[1:08:09] But lest any time your hearts be
[1:08:11] overcharged with suffing
[1:08:16] and drunkenness
[1:08:20] and cares of this life.
[1:08:25] that day come upon you unaware.
[1:08:33] Now that's now what we need to check
[1:08:35] every other day. How am I living?
[1:08:39] Am I overcharged with drunkenness?
[1:08:45] You know you are taken up by the things
[1:08:47] of this life.
[1:08:49] The word of God has no control over your
[1:08:51] life.
[1:08:53] So then that day comes upon you unawares
[1:08:58] the economic situation is not good all
[1:09:00] over the world.
[1:09:13] And then they were saying there are many
[1:09:15] people in USA.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord who are even
[1:09:24] begging to buy groceries,
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:32] poverty increasing
[1:09:35] in Canada. People are not giving birth
[1:09:38] to children because of the cost of of
[1:09:40] housing.
[1:09:45] in Europe and on other countries.
[1:09:49] And you see the Bible says
[1:09:52] that there will be a time
[1:09:55] where you're not going to buy where
[1:09:57] you're not going to sell
[1:10:00] until you have the mark of the beast.
[1:10:04] So the economies of the world have to
[1:10:06] reach that level.
[1:10:09] They have to collapse until they are
[1:10:11] governed by the beast.
[1:10:17] We are living in the season of
[1:10:18] fulfilling of these scriptures.
[1:10:22] The troubles
[1:10:25] of the cares of life
[1:10:29] have to increase.
[1:10:32] What am I going to eat? What am I going
[1:10:35] to do? until people are trying to check
[1:10:38] everything they do.
[1:10:41] Those developed countries, they're
[1:10:43] wondering, do I need to take my children
[1:10:45] to the university to this expensive
[1:10:47] economy?
[1:10:51] Is there any need to take children for
[1:10:53] further studies?
[1:11:00] You know the things are turning upside
[1:11:03] down.
[1:11:05] the cares of life.
[1:11:07] It's becoming a big burden.
[1:11:11] And so now you find that all your mind
[1:11:14] goes into the cares of life.
[1:11:19] No time for church because you have to
[1:11:22] look for the next money.
[1:11:25] If you have even
[1:11:28] you'll still find it's not enough
[1:11:33] because troubles keep on coming,
[1:11:36] needs keep on coming,
[1:11:38] uncertainties keep on coming.
[1:11:42] So it's the time we have to live by the
[1:11:44] word of God.
[1:11:47] Praise the name of the Lord. depending
[1:11:49] upon God in every situation.
[1:11:53] But even when you get something small,
[1:11:57] you put it in the hands of God.
[1:12:00] Praise the name of the Lord. Pay your
[1:12:02] tes,
[1:12:03] pay your offerings and how God can
[1:12:06] magnify that little that you
[1:12:10] not postponing
[1:12:16] it.
[1:12:18] Maybe next time next month may be even
[1:12:19] harder
[1:12:22] and very unfortunate
[1:12:24] even the little of next month may not
[1:12:26] come
[1:12:30] but you need the protection of God
[1:12:33] to see that he guards whatever you have.
[1:12:38] So he says for as a snare
[1:12:41] shall it come upon all of them that
[1:12:43] dwell upon the whole earth.
[1:12:48] Watch ye therefore
[1:12:50] and pray always
[1:12:54] that you may be accounted worthy to
[1:12:56] escape all these things
[1:13:01] that shall come upon the earth and stand
[1:13:04] before the son of man.
[1:13:08] Praise the name of our lord. We need to
[1:13:10] live by the word of God.
[1:13:14] Praise the name of our lord. I want I
[1:13:16] can conclude.
[1:13:19] Now let us go to numbers chapter 15
[1:13:24] and then verse 37.
[1:13:29] Numbers chapter 15 and then verse 37.
[1:13:36] sound.
[1:13:38] So the Bible says,
[1:13:42] "And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; speak unto the children of Israel,
[1:13:52] and bid them that they make fringes in
[1:13:55] the borders of their garments throughout
[1:13:58] their generations, and that they put
[1:14:02] upon them fringe of borders a ribbon of
[1:14:05] blue.
[1:14:30] And it shall be upon you for a fringe
[1:14:33] that you may look upon it and remember
[1:14:38] all the commandments of the Lord and do
[1:14:41] them and that you seek not after your
[1:14:44] own heart and your own eyes after which
[1:14:48] you go a waring
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:23] that you may remember and do all my
[1:15:26] commandments and be holy unto your God.
[1:15:39] I am the Lord your God which brought you
[1:15:42] out of the land of Egypt to be your God.
[1:15:45] I am the Lord your God.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[1:15:56] in your garments
[1:15:59] You put fringes,
[1:16:02] you know, at the borders of your
[1:16:03] garment.
[1:16:06] You put the fringes of blue,
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; you know, a ribbon, something you you
[1:16:12] you saw around like this
[1:16:16] and then it was blue,
[1:16:19] you know, a heavenly color.
[1:16:23] You may look at them
[1:16:27] and then when you look at them, you
[1:16:30] remember the word of God
[1:16:35] so that you don't go by what you see.
[1:16:40] You don't go by what you see.
[1:16:47] So that you don't go by the desires of
[1:16:50] your heart.
[1:16:52] But then when you look at the reband of
[1:16:55] blue,
[1:16:59] then you remember the word of God
[1:17:04] that can guide you in the scenario that
[1:17:06] you are going through.
[1:17:10] Maybe it is a temptation.
[1:17:12] Maybe it is a trial. Maybe it is a
[1:17:15] trouble that you are going through.
[1:17:18] You look at the reband
[1:17:21] And then you remember the word of God.
[1:17:25] What does the word of God say in the
[1:17:27] situation that I'm living in?
[1:17:31] Praise the name of our Lord. They had to
[1:17:34] be influenced by the word of God
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:38] in every situation that they were going
[1:17:40] through.
[1:17:42] What does God require me to do in this
[1:17:44] circumstance?
[1:17:47] How should I take the Christian walk?
[1:17:51] Praise the name of our Lord. And so when
[1:17:53] God commanded the priests also
[1:17:57] when God commanded the priests,
[1:18:00] he told them, "Put on garments
[1:18:04] which are for glory and beauty."
[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:09] And then on your crown,
[1:18:11] you know, on the crown of the high
[1:18:13] priest,
[1:18:15] he had to put the words
[1:18:18] holiness unto God.
[1:18:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Living by
[1:18:24] the word of God.
[1:18:27] So when you allow the word of God
[1:18:30] to influence your decision making,
[1:18:34] every decision that you do,
[1:18:37] like when he told them in Deuteronomy
[1:18:39] chapter 6
[1:18:42] and then verse six,
[1:18:44] he says these words
[1:18:47] which I command you this day
[1:18:52] shall be in your heart.
[1:18:56] Praise the name of our Lord. You keep
[1:18:58] the word of God in your heart
[1:19:02] because in the heart of man,
[1:19:05] that's where understanding is.
[1:19:08] In the heart of man, that's where the
[1:19:11] issues of life come from.
[1:19:13] In the heart of man, that's where the
[1:19:16] thoughts come from.
[1:19:18] That's where decisions come from. So
[1:19:21] then in your heart, you need to have the
[1:19:24] word of God.
[1:19:27] That word of God in your heart will
[1:19:30] influence your decision making
[1:19:34] will influence your walk
[1:19:37] will influence your talk.
[1:19:39] You'll not just move anyhow.
[1:19:42] But the word of God that's in your heart
[1:19:46] will guide you in everything that you
[1:19:48] do.
[1:19:49] And when the word of God is in your
[1:19:51] heart, the word of God becomes your
[1:19:55] protection.
[1:19:58] But it can't protect you if it is not in
[1:20:02] the heart.
[1:20:03] Praise the name of our Lord. So make
[1:20:05] sure that the word of God is in your
[1:20:08] heart. That's how it can protect you.
[1:20:12] That's how it can safeguard you.
[1:20:15] That's how that word
[1:20:18] can become alive in your life
[1:20:21] if it can be in your heart
[1:20:24] because the word is the seed
[1:20:27] and the heart is the ground. So how will
[1:20:31] the seed grow in the ground when the
[1:20:32] seed is not in the ground?
[1:20:37] How will the seed grow in the grow when
[1:20:39] it's not in the ground?
[1:20:42] So you have to have the word of God.
[1:20:46] into your ground
[1:20:48] which is the heart and your heart must
[1:20:51] be a fertile ground
[1:20:54] watered by faith
[1:20:57] meditating upon the word of God
[1:21:00] like in Psalms 1 verse two
[1:21:04] but his delight is in the word of God
[1:21:09] and in the word of God he meditates upon
[1:21:12] it day and night
[1:21:15] That's how you can live by the word of
[1:21:17] God.
[1:21:19] Praise the name of the Lord. And then
[1:21:21] the life, the benefits of the word
[1:21:25] all come to be manifested in your life.
[1:21:28] If you are troubled with evil thoughts,
[1:21:32] put the word of God in your heart.
[1:21:36] If you fear at night,
[1:21:38] put the word of God in your heart.
[1:21:41] Situations are bad about you.
[1:21:44] Put the word of God in your heart
[1:21:47] because the word of God is light.
[1:21:50] All that darkness,
[1:21:53] all the darkness
[1:21:55] will disappear from there. Praise the
[1:21:58] name of our Lord. So then the Bible says
[1:22:02] in Deuteronomy chapter 6
[1:22:05] and then verse 7,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; "And you shall teach the word diligently
[1:22:10] unto your children, and shall talk of
[1:22:13] them when you sit in your house, and
[1:22:16] when you walk by the way, and when you
[1:22:19] lie down, and when you rise up.
[1:22:44] So he says the word is in your heart.
[1:22:47] So you teach it
[1:22:50] to your children, to your house, you
[1:22:54] talk of the word.
[1:22:56] When you sit down, you talk about the
[1:22:59] word. When you are walking, you talk
[1:23:02] about the word. When you lie down, you
[1:23:05] talk about the word. When you rise up,
[1:23:09] what is it? Man shall not live by bread
[1:23:12] alone.
[1:23:14] but by every word
[1:23:17] that proceedth.
[1:23:19] And proceeding is continuous.
[1:23:23] That means you have allowed the Holy
[1:23:25] Spirit
[1:23:27] to teach you continuously.
[1:23:30] You take time and read. You pray, "Lord,
[1:23:33] I don't understand this scripture. Lord,
[1:23:35] I don't understand this message." You
[1:23:38] wait on the Lord. You think about it.
[1:23:41] You pray about it. And then the Lord
[1:23:44] gives you understanding.
[1:23:46] You know, you keep on moving.
[1:23:49] Sometimes you may not understand.
[1:23:52] You may be like the who was coming from
[1:23:53] Ethopia.
[1:23:57] He was reading the book of Isaiah.
[1:24:00] How they took him like a sheep and he
[1:24:04] didn't have any understanding.
[1:24:06] And then he was wondering who does the
[1:24:09] prophet talk about? Is he talking about
[1:24:11] himself or somebody else? But this man,
[1:24:15] this un much as he had limited
[1:24:18] understanding,
[1:24:20] he kept on reading his Bible.
[1:24:23] Praise the name over. And that should be
[1:24:24] the same thing with us. The little that
[1:24:27] he knew,
[1:24:29] he would go to Jerusalem to worship.
[1:24:32] Even us, we need to hold the little we
[1:24:35] know.
[1:24:37] We need to be obedient. The little we
[1:24:39] know.
[1:24:40] And we keep on reading. Lord, I don't
[1:24:43] understand this. And then one day, God,
[1:24:46] brought Philip
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; and then Philip was able to break it.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit in his time comes
[1:24:55] and reveals to you what it is. So then
[1:24:58] he says, "And you shall bind the word
[1:25:01] upon your hand
[1:25:08] and in the frontlets between your eyes,
[1:25:15] and you shall write them upon the posts
[1:25:17] of your house
[1:25:23] and on your gates."
[1:25:26] So you see the word should influence
[1:25:30] whatever you do in your work, at home,
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; your work,
[1:25:37] what you see, all aspects of life.
[1:25:41] You need to allow the word to take
[1:25:43] charge.
[1:25:45] And that's how you shall live by the
[1:25:47] word of God.
[1:25:49] Living by the word of God.
[1:25:52] Amen. May God bless you so much.
[1:25:55] Amen.
[1:25:58] God bless you.
[1:26:01] So I would call upon the youth to come
[1:26:03] on Friday afternoon
[1:26:07] so that we help in doing the cleaning of
[1:26:09] the church. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:26:12] Then on Sunday we have two services.
[1:26:16] So see that you come early enough. We
[1:26:18] shall be having a number of visitors.
[1:26:21] about 200 people have already confirmed
[1:26:23] the coming and then also call upon your
[1:26:27] contributions. Praise the name of our
[1:26:29] Lord. So let us sing that song.
[1:26:37] Let us sing that song which says living
[1:26:40] by faith. Amen.
[1:26:43] Let us stand up.
