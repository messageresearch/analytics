[16:14] Jesus amen let us go to Isaiah chapter
[16:19] 6 and then we're going to read from
[16:23] verse 1 to verse
[16:26] 8 praise the name of our Lord
[16:29] so the Bible
[16:31] says in the year that King uz died I saw
[16:35] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[16:38] and lifted up and his train filled the
[16:41] temple
[17:01] and above it stood The Sims each one had
[17:04] six wings with TR he covered his face
[17:07] and with TR he covered his feet and with
[17:09] TR he did fly
[17:20] [Music]
[17:32] and one Cried unto another and said holy
[17:36] holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole
[17:40] earth is full of his
[17:52] glory and the post of the D moved at the
[17:55] voice of him that cried and the house
[17:57] was filled with
[18:09] smoke then said I what is me for I'm
[18:12] undone because I am a man of unclean
[18:15] lips and I dwell in the midst of a
[18:18] people of unclean lips for mine eyes
[18:20] have seen the king of the king the Lord
[18:24] of hosts
[18:45] then f one of the cims unto me having a
[18:48] life call in his hand which he had taken
[18:51] with the tongues from off the altar
[19:15] and laid it upon my mouth and said Lord
[19:17] this has touched your lips and thy
[19:19] iniquity is taken away and thy sin is
[19:40] I also heard the voice of the Lord
[19:41] saying whom shall I send and who will go
[19:45] for us then said I here am I send me
[20:04] word so I want to preach on the
[20:09] subject being in God's
[20:12] presence praise the name of the Lord
[20:15] being in God's
[20:18] presence and we can see from the story
[20:22] in the Book of
[20:27] Genesis that when When sin
[20:31] came man ran away from the presence of
[20:35] God and it is always
[20:38] sin that makes people run away from the
[20:42] presence of
[20:44] God it is always
[20:47] SE that makes
[20:50] people lose a prayerful
[20:54] life it is always
[20:57] sin that makes people lose interest in
[21:00] reading the word of
[21:04] God it is always
[21:06] SE that makes not wanting to come to
[21:11] church When sin
[21:14] comes people don't want to be in the
[21:17] presence
[21:19] of when Adam and Eve ate of the
[21:24] fruit and then they heard the voice of
[21:27] God Walk In The Garden of
[21:31] the Bible says they hid themselves in
[21:34] the
[21:36] trees say that they are not
[21:39] sin that was the condition of
[21:42] sin because when God when God reached at
[21:46] the meeting
[21:48] place he said wondering where are these
[21:52] people
[21:55] called where are you
[21:59] and then he he
[22:02] confessed we are hidden
[22:04] here because we are
[22:07] naked we are afraid and that's normally
[22:10] what sin
[22:12] does it takes people away from the
[22:15] presence of
[22:18] God sin will even make
[22:22] people not want talk about
[22:25] God or if they are talking about God
[22:29] it's about
[22:31] judgment oh how terrible God
[22:35] is when such a person gets a
[22:39] problem they want to God for what they
[22:41] are going
[22:43] through then you know that they are far
[22:46] away from
[22:48] God and that's what sin
[22:52] does you know just choose the other
[22:58] praise the name of our Lord but you see
[23:01] we want to see how can we always be in
[23:03] the presence
[23:06] of how can you keep your
[23:09] life in constant presence of
[23:14] God at home you're in the continuous
[23:16] presence of
[23:18] God at a place of work you're in the
[23:20] continuous presence of
[23:22] God even when you're a B in the
[23:25] continuous presence of
[23:28] even when you at maybe in the tax
[23:30] traveling
[23:32] somewhere you in the continuous presence
[23:34] of
[23:35] God maybe you are
[23:37] driving you're in the continuous
[23:39] presence of
[23:40] God even in the
[23:43] marketplace where there is a lot of
[23:45] confusion and
[23:47] noise the other comes with this the
[23:50] other one comes with that the other one
[23:52] comes with this you can keep the
[23:55] presence of
[23:56] God in your life
[23:59] even when you're in those funny
[24:01] places praise the name of our Lord you
[24:04] can keep the presence of
[24:06] God you know David said that even if I
[24:10] lay my my bed in
[24:14] hell I will find the presence of
[24:17] God praise the name of our you know that
[24:20] you are not scared wherever you
[24:22] are because you know the presence of
[24:26] gods inside of
[24:30] praise the name of our Lord and that
[24:32] should always be our
[24:35] desire am I in the presence of
[24:38] God praise the name of our are you
[24:41] dwelling in the presence of
[24:44] God praise the name of our Lord now in
[24:48] the message
[24:50] influence he
[24:54] says he says everybody just thinks he so
[24:57] secured
[25:02] they don't reverent God like they
[25:11] should why why do they do
[25:15] this because they are not
[25:23] conscious of his
[25:26] presence they are not
[25:30] conscious you know somebody can come and
[25:34] talk to you words which you feel they
[25:36] are not worth
[25:40] talking they not
[25:43] cons can do
[25:46] anything they have no
[25:48] shame praise the name of the Lord so
[25:52] they are not conscious of the presence
[25:53] of
[25:56] God that's the reason people do
[26:00] that they don't recognize
[26:03] it they
[26:06] can't they can't
[26:11] comprehend that they are in the presence
[26:14] of
[26:16] God their
[26:18] minds become so
[26:22] perverted and taken up in the things of
[26:24] the
[26:26] world till they don't even pay any
[26:29] attention to
[26:32] it they go to church sure but realize
[26:37] that they you are in the presence of
[26:40] God they says they go to
[26:44] church but to
[26:46] realize that you are in the presence of
[26:49] God says not only in a
[26:52] church but wherever you
[26:55] are you are in the presence of God
[26:59] praise the name of our Lord so we need
[27:01] to be
[27:03] conscious when I'm at my place of
[27:06] work I need to be conscious I have the
[27:09] presence of God
[27:12] there when I'm at school I need to be
[27:16] conscious the presence of God is
[27:19] there when I'm doing my
[27:21] business when I'm in my
[27:24] garden when I'm at home or when I'm in
[27:27] my bed
[27:30] I need to be conscious that I'm in in
[27:33] the presence of God so when I'm in my
[27:37] bed maybe that's around midnight 2m.
[27:45] a. everyone is sleeping then you start
[27:47] watching dir
[27:50] things hearing dir things you're not
[27:53] conscious about God's
[27:56] presence because you feel that now I can
[27:59] do the dirty
[28:01] things but we need to be conscious about
[28:04] the presence of
[28:07] God all the time in our
[28:10] lives and wherever we
[28:13] are in whatever we are
[28:16] doing we need to be conscious about the
[28:19] presence of
[28:22] God and
[28:24] now in the message the proof of his
[28:26] resurrection
[28:29] he was talking about those people on the
[28:31] road to
[28:34] ous I think we can go to Luke chap
[28:38] 24 then we can get back to that
[28:42] quot praise the name of our Lord Luke
[28:51] 24 the scripture
[28:54] says and behold two of them went that
[28:57] same day to a Village called imos which
[29:00] was from Jerusalem about three SC
[29:22] Falls and they talk together of all
[29:25] these things which had happened
[29:32] and it came to pass while they communed
[29:36] together and
[29:39] reasoned Jesus himself Drew
[29:43] near and went with
[29:46] them but their eyes were Holden that
[29:49] they should not know
[29:53] him and they said unto and he said unto
[29:57] them
[29:58] what manner of communications are these
[30:01] that you have one to another as you walk
[30:03] and
[30:23] ass and one of them said whose name was
[30:26] cleopas answering and said unto him him
[30:28] at TH the only Stranger in Jerusalem
[30:30] that has not known the things which are
[30:33] come to pass in these
[30:51] days and he said unto them what things
[30:54] and they said unto him concerning Jesus
[30:57] of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty
[30:59] indeed and word before God and all the
[31:17] people now you see they were talking
[31:19] about Jesus
[31:21] Christ and now when they were talking
[31:23] about Jesus
[31:25] Christ you know talking a convers
[31:29] know talking this has
[31:31] happened how expect to be
[31:34] Messiah to be the Redeemer to Deliver Us
[31:38] from the
[31:39] Romans but have killed him and now all
[31:43] disciples are
[31:45] scattered they were talking about him
[31:49] and now when they continue talking about
[31:53] Jesus then Jesus Christ appeared
[31:58] praise the name of the Lord and then
[32:00] brother Bram says the message the proof
[32:03] of his
[32:05] resurrection the conversation was
[32:08] right they were talking about
[32:12] him that is when he
[32:16] appeared and that's the
[32:18] reason he doesn't appear to so many of
[32:22] us
[32:24] today our
[32:26] conversations is talking about
[32:28] everything
[32:31] else and not
[32:33] Christ we are always talking about when
[32:36] we are going to get the work
[32:39] done or what we are going to do
[32:42] here let your
[32:45] conversations be on
[32:47] Christ that's when he
[32:50] appears is when you talk about
[32:54] him be speaking about him
[32:58] and you know that's that's the principle
[33:00] even in the spirit
[33:06] world Spirits when you start talking
[33:09] about any
[33:12] Spirit it comes
[33:15] close any
[33:18] Spirit when you start talking about
[33:22] witches they know you are you are
[33:24] inciting the Demons of which to just
[33:26] come around
[33:30] and the more you continue talking about
[33:32] them is the more they take a hold of
[33:35] you you start
[33:38] fearing even something which start
[33:40] Imaging maybe is the
[33:44] one and then at night you dream
[33:48] about that's the
[33:50] principle these
[33:54] people who go and start enchanting
[34:01] they start praising their
[34:03] Spirits then you start seeing them
[34:06] landing on One landing on anothering on
[34:09] another and then they start in communion
[34:12] with the
[34:16] spirit because they know how to start
[34:18] calling those spirits to
[34:20] come calling their names calling
[34:24] what it's just like us somebody calls
[34:28] your
[34:29] name you'll turn and say who is
[34:32] this then you also start calling the
[34:34] name of a
[34:37] demon why you invite
[34:41] the and but you see there are people who
[34:43] just like that kind of
[34:48] conversation when they talk about
[34:50] something that's not
[34:52] right those demons just
[34:54] come you are worshiping them you are
[34:58] opening channels for
[35:01] them and so they give you more
[35:05] imagination and then you get yourself
[35:07] you are lost in the world of
[35:10] Dem so when we talk about
[35:14] Christ he
[35:17] appears like here they were on the road
[35:21] to and then they started talking about
[35:25] Christ and when they talked about
[35:28] Christ Christ came there and he
[35:33] appeared praise the name of our Lord we
[35:36] can also have the presence of God in our
[35:39] Liv when we talk about
[35:42] God praise the name of our Lord talk
[35:45] about
[35:46] God wherever you're going in whatever
[35:50] you're doing testify about the goodness
[35:53] of the Lord and then you'll see the
[35:56] presence of God coming down
[35:59] praise the name of our Lord I believe
[36:01] let us go to Deuteronomy chapter
[36:06] 6 praise the name of our
[36:12] lordy and then we read from verse let me
[36:15] pick the verse
[36:18] here Deuteronomy chapter
[36:21] 6 and then
[36:24] verse he says and these words which I
[36:27] command you this day shall be in your
[36:36] heart it says they shall be in your
[36:42] hearts they have to be in your heart
[36:46] permanently so you can think
[36:49] about you can meditate
[36:52] about you can talk about them praise the
[36:56] name of there in your
[36:59] heart and the Bible says the mouth
[37:03] speaketh from the
[37:13] abundance now you find out what you like
[37:16] talking
[37:18] about praise the name of know there some
[37:21] places of
[37:24] work maybe mechanics
[37:28] when a woman passes where they are
[37:30] repairing
[37:32] from then they start talking about
[37:35] women all those
[37:42] elting their motivation is making obene
[37:47] words when they are pulling the PO
[37:51] making
[37:53] that you know kind of different places
[37:58] you go maybe to a
[38:01] salon there also a conversation that is
[38:04] there you go to a drinking
[38:07] place there also conversations are
[38:10] there they have dir in their
[38:14] hearts it comes out of
[38:21] their now the Bible is telling us that
[38:25] the word of God
[38:28] should always be in our
[38:32] heart praise the name of our Lord the
[38:35] word of God should be such a great
[38:40] resource in our heart let us go to
[38:43] Psalms
[38:46] 119 and then verse
[38:49] 11 praise the name of our Lord Psalms
[38:52] 119 verse
[38:59] Psalms 119
[39:03] verse1 he
[39:08] says Thy word have I hid in my heart
[39:12] that I may not sin
[39:19] against praise the name that should be
[39:22] the same issue we should
[39:25] have have that depos of the
[39:30] word you know deposit it in your
[39:33] heart keep on feeding on the word
[39:37] daily keep on meditating upon the word
[39:40] of God
[39:42] daily I have hid your word in my
[39:47] heart that I may not sin against
[39:51] you and you know the devil fights us so
[39:55] much that in your heart there's no word
[39:59] of
[40:00] God the devil fights that so
[40:04] much because he knows if the word of God
[40:07] is not in your
[40:10] heart that word of God can never
[40:13] transform
[40:15] you the word of God can never influence
[40:20] you it can't change your
[40:23] soul it can't change your
[40:26] spe is not in the heart so Satan fights
[40:30] the word from coming to the
[40:34] heart that's what the scripture tells us
[40:37] let us go to Matthew
[40:40] 13 praise the name of our Lord MTH
[40:45] 13 and then the Bible
[40:51] says verse
[40:53] four and when the and when he sold seed
[40:58] some fell by the wayside and the Falls
[41:01] came and died them
[41:12] up so he says the seed was
[41:16] sown but then it fell on the West
[41:21] Side a heart that is not
[41:25] concerned so the devil comes and steals
[41:28] that
[41:30] seed in verse
[41:33] 19 it says when anyone hears the word of
[41:37] the
[41:39] kingdom and understands it
[41:44] not then cometh the wicked
[41:47] one and catches away that which is sown
[41:51] in his
[41:55] heart this is which received the seed by
[41:58] the
[42:01] way so we shouldn't allow our hearts to
[42:04] be
[42:08] a because you the devil has
[42:11] access he comes and steals the
[42:15] word praise the name of our Lord you
[42:18] know the Bible says we shouldn't be a
[42:21] forgetful
[42:24] hearers you've heard the word
[42:27] but then the following day you are doing
[42:29] the same
[42:32] thing that shows the word is not in
[42:36] the Satan has C it
[42:39] away when we hear the word
[42:42] of we need to mix
[42:46] faith in that word we have
[42:48] received it doesn't matter what your
[42:51] condition
[42:53] is praise the name of our Lord and then
[42:55] you say Lord I have
[42:59] your we need to be like
[43:02] Isaiah when Isaiah got into the presence
[43:06] of
[43:07] God and then he saw the
[43:10] sarapin crying
[43:14] holy that was a
[43:17] gospel he saw saying God You Are
[43:21] Holy You Are Holy and that's the gospel
[43:25] we also hear the word of God Isaiah came
[43:30] to his
[43:31] senses he
[43:33] realized that he was a man of unlean
[43:36] lips and he said oh I'm a man of unclean
[43:40] lips in other words he was saying Lord
[43:43] have mercy
[43:44] upon help me this condition I'm
[43:48] In Praise the name of should be
[43:52] ourselves you know you don't hide your
[43:55] weaknesses before God
[43:58] but then confess them and said Lord this
[44:01] is my
[44:02] weakness Lord this is my
[44:04] failure is where I need
[44:07] help praise the name of Lord then you
[44:10] see the help of God
[44:12] coming and then you see those chains
[44:14] being
[44:17] broken praise the name of the Lord the
[44:20] Lord comes and delivers
[44:22] you when you get into the presence of
[44:25] God when you come into the service like
[44:28] now you need to realize your
[44:32] weaknesses and when you realize your
[44:34] weaknesses that's a time to say Lord I
[44:36] need help in this area Lord I need to be
[44:40] delivered in this
[44:41] area like Isaiah he cried I'm
[44:47] unlean praise the name of our Lord like
[44:50] those lepers who were sitting away from
[44:52] the
[44:54] public when they saw the Lord
[44:57] Christ himself then they CED we
[45:04] unan what did he tell them be made whole
[45:09] praise the name of our and that's what
[45:11] the presence of God does to
[45:13] us when you know the priest
[45:17] Joshua the high priest in Zaria chapter
[45:22] 3 now you can imagine the high priest in
[45:24] this kind of condition
[45:29] go to zarter
[45:32] 3 and then verse one he showed me Joshua
[45:36] the high priest standing before the
[45:39] angel of the Lord and Satan standing at
[45:42] his right
[45:54] res can you imagine
[45:57] this is the high
[46:00] priest is meant to be the most holy man
[46:03] upon the whole
[46:06] earth is the man who at for the sins of
[46:09] the whole
[46:12] world he goes in the holy of
[46:15] holies once in a year and then offers
[46:19] sacrifices and inters for
[46:23] Mercy all the people and then you see
[46:26] his condition
[46:28] the Bible says he was standing before
[46:31] the angel of the
[46:34] Lord as he stood before the
[46:36] angel Satan also stood on his right
[46:41] hand and right hand means
[46:44] Authority it means power in other words
[46:49] Satan was
[46:52] resisting Satan was hindering him
[46:57] he was preventing
[47:00] him he was refusing
[47:02] him he was pulling him
[47:06] back and there are some people come into
[47:08] the presence of
[47:10] God and the devil keeps on resisting
[47:12] them through the
[47:16] service you're not meant to be
[47:19] here for you know they not talking
[47:22] about for you you are off
[47:27] or on the other hand the devil
[47:29] does has come for
[47:32] you and then now you say but why is
[47:34] talking
[47:36] about a
[47:38] demon don't own that
[47:41] demon praise the name of just reject
[47:45] it and say Lord I want your
[47:48] deliverance Lord I need to be
[47:52] helped the devil is
[47:55] so even at
[47:57] homes when the husband and wife
[48:02] disagree and then you have not resoled
[48:05] it or even if you have resolved it but
[48:08] if one of them makes a
[48:10] mistake then the spirit comes you
[48:14] see you see this is what I was even
[48:17] telling I was telling you and then the
[48:20] devil starts preaching to you and then
[48:23] you get
[48:24] back in difference
[48:29] now Satan was resisting the high
[48:33] priest and then the scripture says and
[48:36] the Lord said unto
[48:39] Satan the Lord rebuke you oh
[48:43] Satan even the Lord that has chosen
[48:46] Jalem reuk
[48:50] you is not this a brand pled out of the
[48:53] fire
[48:58] now Joshua was clothed with filthy
[49:08] garments and stood before the
[49:12] angel praise the name of a high
[49:15] priest F
[49:18] gar but stood before the presence
[49:22] of he needed to be
[49:24] helped he needed to be
[49:28] the same thing with us we need to be
[49:31] helped we need to be
[49:33] delivered so you don't run away from the
[49:36] presence
[49:37] of you just come before the
[49:40] Lord Lord I wanton stand before
[49:44] you make me
[49:46] clean make me
[49:48] whole deliver me from my
[49:51] weaknesses deliver me from my
[49:54] weaknesses deliver me from my failures
[49:58] that's what Joshua was standing there
[50:00] and when Joshua stood
[50:02] there then he was made
[50:06] clean praise the name of our Lord and
[50:09] when we come to the presence of
[50:11] God that's what we should always
[50:14] desire Lord make me
[50:17] clean Lord make
[50:20] me when Adam and
[50:23] Eve got into the presence of God of
[50:27] course they had run away from
[50:29] God God went to
[50:32] them and they had made themselves fig
[50:35] leaves but the
[50:37] Fig which is
[50:40] religion would not take away their
[50:46] iniquity would not take away their
[50:51] nakedness that's why they were in the
[50:53] leaves in the trees hiding themselves
[50:57] but you can't hide yourself from
[51:00] God so the best thing is you come to the
[51:04] Lord Lord Here I
[51:07] Am Lord I'm
[51:09] unan Lord Wash Me In the Blood of
[51:12] Jesus deliver me from this kind of
[51:15] scenario Lord make
[51:18] me and when the Lord was was with Adam
[51:21] and
[51:22] Eve he had the
[51:24] solution he had to SL an
[51:27] animal praise the name of the and the
[51:30] blood of the
[51:32] animal covered their sin and then he
[51:35] dressed them in the ship
[51:40] skin and their nakedness was not
[51:43] there praise the name of our Lord so now
[51:46] we see also that in the vision of
[51:50] Isaiah he saw the
[51:53] sarim
[51:55] flying and crying holy
[52:01] holy and the Bible says two Wings
[52:04] covered the
[52:06] face and the wings that covered the
[52:09] face they meant
[52:13] reverence reverencing God we can't look
[52:17] at your
[52:19] face had never
[52:22] seen they were holy
[52:25] sarapin they cover their faces wouldn't
[52:29] exactly see the presence of God and they
[52:32] were flying
[52:35] holy and then two
[52:38] Wings covered their
[52:40] feet which meant
[52:43] humility they were humble before the
[52:45] presence of
[52:47] God they feared the presence of God and
[52:51] then they humbled
[52:53] themselves and then the two wings were
[52:55] flying
[52:57] which meant
[53:00] service praise the name of so they were
[53:04] covered praise the name of the Lord now
[53:07] in the message
[53:09] influence he
[53:14] says let us think them two Wings he had
[53:19] over his
[53:22] face in the presence of
[53:25] God and secondly two weeks over his
[53:30] feet what was it
[53:33] humility third he f with them up himself
[53:37] in
[53:41] action then covered his face in
[53:45] reverence two Wings covered his in
[53:49] humility was in
[53:52] action what was he doing he was showing
[53:56] the pro
[53:58] by this he was showing the prophet how
[54:02] he pre his prepared servants must
[54:07] be God prepared service must be
[54:14] rever
[54:16] humble and in
[54:19] action if you uncover
[54:23] yourself uncover your feet
[54:27] your action isn't going to do no
[54:31] good because you are steered
[54:36] wrong it all to guide
[54:42] you
[54:45] R
[54:46] humble and in action that's what God
[54:50] wants his Pentecostal group to be
[54:56] for God wants his church to be in
[55:01] action praise the name of and you know
[55:03] when they in the presence of
[55:05] God they covered their faces they
[55:09] covered their feet and then he says in
[55:12] paragraph
[55:15] 126 you say well brother Bram you just
[55:20] said they were provided with two
[55:23] wings and you are provided with
[55:26] something
[55:29] too the blood of Jesus
[55:32] Christ that is your
[55:37] [Music]
[55:40] covering you don't stand as
[55:43] a you don't stand as
[55:46] a you don't stand as an
[55:49] angel but you stand as a redeemed son or
[55:53] daughter of God
[55:58] by this by his blood you don't have to
[56:01] have these wings that they
[56:04] had there are a special covering for
[56:07] them in in that
[56:10] presence but you got the blood of Jesus
[56:14] Christ for a
[56:16] covering to stand
[56:19] there now if you've got that
[56:23] blood then you honor God
[56:27] you love God you respect God and God is
[56:32] the
[56:33] word praise the name of our Lord so when
[56:36] we want to get into the presence of
[56:39] God we need to be in the blood of
[56:42] Jesus and when we in the blood of Jesus
[56:45] Christ all our
[56:49] unrighteousness all our sin all our
[56:53] trespasses all our imperfection
[56:57] is all taken care of by the blood of
[57:01] Jesus praise the name of our and the
[57:04] blood of Jesus Christ is the bleeding
[57:07] word of
[57:09] God so David say I have put your word
[57:14] I've hid your word in my
[57:16] heart that I may not
[57:19] sin and the Bible says the word should
[57:22] be in our
[57:24] hearts now when the word is in
[57:27] our you will not
[57:29] sin and sin is
[57:33] unbelief praise the name of the Lord so
[57:36] when the word is in your
[57:37] heart then you need to have faith in
[57:40] that
[57:42] word praise the name of and when you
[57:45] have faith in the word and the word is
[57:48] in your
[57:48] heart praise the name of our lord it's
[57:51] not difficult for you to be in the
[57:54] presence of God
[57:56] think about the
[57:58] word you'll get in the presence of
[58:02] God upon the word you get in the
[58:05] presence of God praise the name of our
[58:08] lord it's not
[58:10] difficult praise the name of our Lord
[58:12] even when you are alone at
[58:14] home you can swich yourself into the
[58:17] presence of
[58:19] God it's not
[58:21] difficult praise the name of right now
[58:26] we are under the New
[58:29] Testament and the New Testament is the
[58:33] blood of Jesus
[58:34] Christ in the Old Testament they had a
[58:37] place God had chosen for
[58:41] worship there's a place that God had
[58:45] selected where his presence
[58:48] was so they would travel long distances
[58:51] to go to that
[58:53] place but right now the Bible tell
[58:57] in
[58:59] joh verse 24 and
[59:03] 25 can go and read that
[59:06] scripture praise the name of our Lord
[59:09] John
[59:10] 4 and then
[59:13] verse let us start from verse
[59:16] 23 let us start from verse 21 to give us
[59:18] a good
[59:20] backround he says Jesus said unto her
[59:28] believe me the hour
[59:32] cometh when you shall neither in this
[59:35] mountain nor at Jerusalem worship the
[59:44] father that was the Old Testament but
[59:47] says the time is
[59:50] coming and says now is the
[59:54] time not going to the Temple
[59:57] Mount not only waiting on
[1:00:01] Sunday not waiting only when the church
[1:00:03] is
[1:00:04] open but even where you are you can
[1:00:08] bring down the presence
[1:00:09] of praise the name of our Lord verse 22
[1:00:14] you worship ye not what you
[1:00:17] know we know what we
[1:00:20] worship salvation is of the Jews
[1:00:26] come and now
[1:00:29] is when the true
[1:00:32] worshipers shall worship the father in
[1:00:37] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:00:41] seeketh such toship
[1:00:47] him is a spirit and they that worship
[1:00:52] God must worship Him
[1:00:56] spirit and in truth praise the name of
[1:01:00] our Lord that's how the Lord seeketh us
[1:01:04] toship that we may worship him in the
[1:01:08] spirit and in the truth which is Spirit
[1:01:13] the holy
[1:01:14] spirit in the
[1:01:16] truth what is truth Thy word is
[1:01:21] truth so he wants us to worship him in
[1:01:23] the spirit
[1:01:26] and in the
[1:01:28] words praise the name of our Lord the
[1:01:31] two
[1:01:33] pens that
[1:01:36] Christ gave to the inkeeper
[1:01:41] so when we come to
[1:01:43] church and the word of God is
[1:01:47] ministered we are receiving the
[1:01:50] spirit and the word praise the name of
[1:01:54] our Lord you receiving both of them the
[1:01:57] spirit and the word and so it is a
[1:02:03] resource it
[1:02:06] is so now you receive it you put it in
[1:02:11] your
[1:02:12] heart praise the name of and then it
[1:02:14] will bring
[1:02:17] life praise the name of our Lord it will
[1:02:19] bring the life of Jesus
[1:02:23] Christ praise the name of the Lord when
[1:02:26] you have you allow the Holy
[1:02:29] Spirit to have charge over your
[1:02:32] heart then the holy
[1:02:34] spirit in your heart will take over all
[1:02:38] your
[1:02:41] thinking praise the name of he will take
[1:02:44] charge over your
[1:02:45] mind you will not allow evil
[1:02:49] thoughts you know you reject
[1:02:52] them somebody does you something
[1:02:56] and then the demon of hatred
[1:03:01] comes manyon
[1:03:06] possessed so when you H another person
[1:03:08] your demon
[1:03:11] possess demon of
[1:03:13] hatred so now the demons the demon of
[1:03:16] hatred
[1:03:19] comes why is done this hate
[1:03:23] him but when the Holy Ghost is there
[1:03:27] say Lord forgive
[1:03:29] him praise the name of the Lord so it
[1:03:32] keeps pushing the sin
[1:03:35] away why because the presence of God is
[1:03:38] right
[1:03:40] inside so keeps on pushing that
[1:03:44] out he pushes Darkness
[1:03:47] out praise the name of so we can live in
[1:03:50] the presence of
[1:03:52] God continuously
[1:03:58] praise the name of
[1:04:00] continuously praise the name of our Lord
[1:04:03] you don't
[1:04:04] say this m has been a bad M for
[1:04:08] me I don't know when we are going to go
[1:04:11] back to
[1:04:13] church you don't need
[1:04:15] that once the presence of God is
[1:04:18] there it will keep you through
[1:04:21] Monday keep you through Tuesday on
