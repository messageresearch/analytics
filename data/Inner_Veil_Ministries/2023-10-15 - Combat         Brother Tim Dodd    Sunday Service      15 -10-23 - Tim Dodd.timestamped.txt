[1:31:54] not uh because you know you really feel
[1:31:58] like you want talk to the soul of a
[1:32:02] man and once you talk and you know the
[1:32:06] soul
[1:32:08] receives amen I mean it it will honestly
[1:32:13] say
[1:32:15] Amen or it will lift a hand

[1:33:17] into
[1:33:20] millions to get the value that we

[1:37:47] and turn to the Book of
[1:37:50] Revelation
[1:37:51] you know who I am so I don't need much
[1:37:58] introduction Revelation chapter
[1:38:02] 4 now I want to spend both Services
[1:38:06] dealing with the anointings around the
[1:38:08] Throne of
[1:38:13] God the anointing that he sends upon the
[1:38:17] church and this morning we're going to
[1:38:19] take and lay the found
[1:38:23] Nation so that this evening we can this
[1:38:26] afternoon we can speak specifically of
[1:38:29] your
[1:38:33] anointing so I trust you'll stay with me
[1:38:37] today as brother Steven
[1:38:39] said if the word strikes
[1:38:43] you then just say
[1:38:45] Amen or raise your hand or if you're
[1:38:49] Baptist nod your head
[1:38:57] praise the
[1:38:58] lord it's good to be here let's bow our
[1:39:00] heads in a word of
[1:39:02] prayer Heavenly
[1:39:05] Father we come now to a very sacred
[1:39:09] time recognizing Lord that no man can
[1:39:12] give
[1:39:14] Revelation you alone are the revealer of
[1:39:17] the
[1:39:19] word but you have our by the foolishness
[1:39:22] of
[1:39:24] preaching that your word would go
[1:39:27] forth that it would save
[1:39:30] Souls that it would edify the
[1:39:33] church that it would bring us into a
[1:39:36] perfect
[1:39:38] stature that it would loose Divine love
[1:39:40] amongst the
[1:39:42] people Lord I pray you take the
[1:39:44] preeminence
[1:39:46] today as we read the word and speak of
[1:39:50] it Lord may you anoint the
[1:39:53] speaker anoint The
[1:39:56] Interpreter anoint the
[1:39:58] hearer may we all come into one mind and
[1:40:01] one
[1:40:03] Accord for we know if we can come into
[1:40:05] one
[1:40:07] mind then Lord you would move
[1:40:10] spontaneously healings would take place
[1:40:14] Deliverance would
[1:40:15] happen demons would be set to
[1:40:18] fight and so we ask your blessing
[1:40:22] this service is yours
[1:40:24] father blessed we pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:40:28] name amen amen Revelation 4 and verse
[1:40:35] 6 and Before the Throne there was a sea
[1:40:37] of glass like unto Crystal and in the
[1:40:39] midst of the throne and round about The
[1:40:41] Throne were four beasts full of eyes
[1:40:45] before and
[1:40:49] behind
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:01] and the first Beast was like a lion and
[1:41:03] the second beast like a calf and the
[1:41:05] third Beast had the face of a man and
[1:41:08] the fourth Beast was like a flying
[1:41:19] eagle
[1:41:23] and the four beasts had each of them six
[1:41:26] wings about him and they were full of
[1:41:28] eyes within and they rest not day and
[1:41:31] night saying holy holy holy Lord God
[1:41:34] Almighty which was and is and
[1:41:49] is
[1:41:55] amen the Lord add his Blessing to the
[1:41:57] word you may have your
[1:42:01] seats now as we read in the Book of
[1:42:05] Revelation we recognize that the Book of
[1:42:07] Revelation is a book of
[1:42:11] symbols that these four
[1:42:14] beasts they were representing
[1:42:18] something John saw them in a vision
[1:42:22] Ezekiel Saw them in a
[1:42:25] vision they were even reflected in the
[1:42:28] Old
[1:42:29] Testament now the Book of Revelation is
[1:42:31] a book of
[1:42:33] symbols but the Old Testament is shadows
[1:42:36] and
[1:42:39] types but you are the
[1:42:42] reality hallelujah hallelujah you are
[1:42:45] the reality that God has come to dwell
[1:42:48] in you are the house of God
[1:42:52] you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you
[1:42:55] are the one that he is his ultimate
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:42:59] purpose is that God would come from
[1:43:03] Elohim the self-existing
[1:43:06] God and take the name
[1:43:10] Jehovah which means a God the god that
[1:43:12] dwells with his people for his
[1:43:17] family amen we are the family of God
[1:43:22] I think I heard you singing it this
[1:43:24] morning I'm so glad I'm a part of the
[1:43:26] family of
[1:43:28] God how many are
[1:43:30] glad amen now we see that we are in
[1:43:35] great distress of
[1:43:38] times and the enemy is trying to destroy
[1:43:42] the
[1:43:45] world and he has rights in this
[1:43:49] world But ultimately what he wants to
[1:43:55] destroy is the predestinated of
[1:43:59] God for they are the word made manifest
[1:44:03] in this
[1:44:06] age that's
[1:44:08] you that's
[1:44:11] Israel amen God has a purpose and a
[1:44:16] place the for the ones that he
[1:44:19] forew and he wrote on the Lamb's Book of
[1:44:23] Life before the foundation of the
[1:44:27] world in other words we were always on
[1:44:31] in his
[1:44:33] mind but now have become manifest in
[1:44:37] this
[1:44:39] age all right now I want to read some
[1:44:43] quotes from God's Prophet this
[1:44:47] morning I know you're a church that
[1:44:49] believes brother ROM was God's
[1:44:51] Vindicated
[1:44:55] prophet and you could put the slides up
[1:44:58] for me on the
[1:45:01] screen it will just help us to follow
[1:45:03] along a little
[1:45:06] bit amen now these are out of the fifth
[1:45:12] seal and if I have go back
[1:45:14] one if I have a title for the service
[1:45:17] this morning it's
[1:45:19] combat
[1:45:22] you are in a
[1:45:24] combat a
[1:45:26] battle you you are in a high intensity
[1:45:33] combat but it's not flesh and
[1:45:36] blood is spiritual
[1:45:39] powers that you are fighting
[1:45:42] against but you're not fighting by your
[1:45:44] own
[1:45:45] power you're fighting by the power of
[1:45:48] the holy spirit in the church
[1:45:53] all right let's put this first page up
[1:45:55] I'm not sure why the um uh transitions
[1:45:58] aren't working they should go step by
[1:46:00] step and uh just give me okay well we'll
[1:46:05] leave this up here and uh are you using
[1:46:08] space bar to
[1:46:13] transition I just want to get it good
[1:46:15] for you so you can follow along should
[1:46:18] go what are we in F5 click
[1:46:21] F5 F5 F5 function five all right and
[1:46:26] then space bar to get from one spot to
[1:46:28] the
[1:46:29] other no all right we'll leave we'll
[1:46:32] leave this here all right I'll follow
[1:46:34] along on this page all right then just
[1:46:37] what as we when I tell you just press
[1:46:39] the space bar okay all right here we go
[1:46:43] are you
[1:46:44] ready all right now brother Ram says in
[1:46:46] the fifth
[1:46:48] seal we find out in the church ages that
[1:46:51] those four
[1:46:52] beasts meaning four
[1:46:58] powers was gathered around the Acts of
[1:47:01] the Apostles just the way that the
[1:47:04] Tabernacle in the
[1:47:09] wilderness so the prophet of God is
[1:47:11] saying these four
[1:47:14] beasts is gathered around the Acts of
[1:47:16] the
[1:47:18] Apostles now I want you to
[1:47:21] remember the church is a continuation of
[1:47:24] the book of
[1:47:27] Acts so it's not just the Acts of the
[1:47:30] Apostles in the first
[1:47:37] age but it's the acts of the holy spirit
[1:47:41] in the church through every
[1:47:46] age
[1:47:47] amen now he goes on he says say they
[1:47:51] were watching over
[1:47:55] this the lamb and the word to perform
[1:47:59] the
[1:48:02] word just as they did the Ark of the
[1:48:08] Covenant in the Holy place in the
[1:48:13] wilderness amen and so forth next he
[1:48:17] says
[1:48:19] notice the even the nature of the Beast
[1:48:22] was exactly a tribal
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:32] emblem now in order to show you this I
[1:48:34] have a little diagram for
[1:48:38] you to show you what brother brandham
[1:48:41] was talking
[1:48:44] about this is the ark the Tabernacle in
[1:48:47] the
[1:48:49] wilderness
[1:48:51] now notice that it has three
[1:48:54] courts it has the outer
[1:48:57] Court the holy place and the holy of
[1:49:01] holies in the outer Court the whole of
[1:49:03] the congregation could
[1:49:08] enter the holy place was where the
[1:49:10] priesthood would
[1:49:13] Minister and the table of showbread was
[1:49:16] in
[1:49:17] there and the candlesticks were in there
[1:49:21] and the altar of incense was in
[1:49:25] there but then there was a third
[1:49:28] place that was the holy of
[1:49:31] holies and God dwelt in the holy of
[1:49:34] H and the high priest entered in there
[1:49:38] once a
[1:49:39] year with blood to make intercession for
[1:49:43] the
[1:49:45] people it was a
[1:49:47] representation and that representation
[1:49:49] is is
[1:49:51] you you have three
[1:49:54] courts your body your spirit your
[1:49:59] soul see it shows that in the flesh the
[1:50:02] world has access to the
[1:50:07] flesh you live in this
[1:50:09] world you contact This World by this
[1:50:13] body see taste feel smell and
[1:50:19] hear that's that's the outer Court by
[1:50:22] which we contact the
[1:50:25] world
[1:50:27] Amen now and the next
[1:50:31] court no no no sorry go back page up no
[1:50:36] I'll tell you when just give me the
[1:50:37] whole court
[1:50:38] again next one he's
[1:50:42] up here we go we'll stay here for a
[1:50:46] while all right now in this
[1:50:49] court in the second
[1:50:51] Court we have the we have where the
[1:50:54] priesthood
[1:50:56] goes represents your
[1:51:00] spirit listen now the the priesthood is
[1:51:03] the
[1:51:06] ministry see the ministry deals with the
[1:51:08] battle that's going on in your
[1:51:13] mind that's showing us the purpose of
[1:51:16] the
[1:51:18] ministry to preach
[1:51:20] word because the ministry in general
[1:51:23] does not go into the holy of
[1:51:27] holies the holy of holies is God's
[1:51:30] domain
[1:51:33] alone your soul is God's domain
[1:51:38] alone when God comes into your
[1:51:42] soul you are sealed until the day of
[1:51:44] your
[1:51:46] Redemption amen the devil can't get in
[1:51:49] there
[1:51:50] no man can get in
[1:51:52] there but there's a high
[1:51:55] priest the one high priest the Lord
[1:51:58] Jesus
[1:52:00] Christ with his own blood who
[1:52:03] sanctifieth
[1:52:05] forever those that
[1:52:08] believe he enters into the soul realm
[1:52:11] and your nature is
[1:52:15] changed from
[1:52:17] unbelief to
[1:52:18] Faith
[1:52:20] amen from sin to perfect
[1:52:25] love and he is our high
[1:52:28] priest listen now Paul says in the book
[1:52:32] of
[1:52:33] Hebrews and he goes through the first
[1:52:35] seven
[1:52:38] chapters establishing the deity of Jesus
[1:52:43] Christ and then chapter 8 and verse
[1:52:48] one he says the sum of these things
[1:52:54] is we have a high
[1:52:57] priest
[1:52:59] amen now brother brandham preached on
[1:53:01] the first seven chapters of
[1:53:05] Hebrews but if you take chapter 8 to
[1:53:08] chapter
[1:53:11] 10 you'll find that Jesus is the high
[1:53:15] priest all right and the ministration of
[1:53:18] the high priest
[1:53:21] listen closely now he is the high priest
[1:53:24] of our
[1:53:27] confession
[1:53:28] if you are a temple of the Living
[1:53:33] God he is a high priest of the Temple of
[1:53:37] the Living
[1:53:39] God he is not everyone's high
[1:53:43] priest he is a high priest of the
[1:53:47] temple which was represented in in the
[1:53:50] wilderness so he is your high priest
[1:53:54] when by faith you have received the
[1:53:57] blood one
[1:54:00] sacrifice all
[1:54:02] sin past present and
[1:54:05] future you are sealed to the day of your
[1:54:09] Redemption and the high priest makes
[1:54:12] intercession for
[1:54:14] you ministering for
[1:54:17] you hallelujah hallelujah because you
[1:54:20] are a temple of the Living
[1:54:25] God all right so this is what God's
[1:54:29] protection is
[1:54:32] for for his Dwelling
[1:54:35] Place he is the
[1:54:37] word John 1 and
[1:54:39] one in the beginning was the
[1:54:42] word John 1:14 and the word became flesh
[1:54:46] and dwelt Among
[1:54:48] Us
[1:54:50] Jesus was the Temple of the fullness of
[1:54:55] God but he went to
[1:54:57] Calvary to loose the feminine part of
[1:55:00] his
[1:55:02] Spirit to come back to the church in
[1:55:04] Acts chapter
[1:55:07] 2 so we could also say about
[1:55:12] you the word became flesh and dwelt
[1:55:15] Among
[1:55:18] Us you you are the Temple of the Living
[1:55:22] God and God is protecting his Dwelling
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:29] Place
[1:55:31] amen now you can give
[1:55:35] me amen
[1:55:39] amen Next
[1:55:42] Step all right there we are let's just
[1:55:46] shrink it down because I want to show
[1:55:47] you the layout here around the
[1:55:50] Tabernacle in the
[1:55:53] wilderness all right now let me take a
[1:55:55] step back
[1:55:57] here now Moses saw the pattern in
[1:56:02] heaven he saw what John
[1:56:05] saw you saw what Ezekiel
[1:56:08] Saw and he was told to take the
[1:56:12] pattern set it up on
[1:56:14] earth now Israel coming out of Egypt
[1:56:20] were not anything but a what would be
[1:56:23] the right word for it an a
[1:56:26] disorganized mass of
[1:56:32] people all they knew was the god of
[1:56:35] Abraham Isaac and
[1:56:38] Jacob that was their claim to
[1:56:42] God but now God is going to reveal
[1:56:45] himself of his final
[1:56:48] manifestation
[1:56:50] in a shadow here amongst Israel in the
[1:56:54] wilderness now listen when Moses comes
[1:56:57] down from the
[1:56:59] mountain he doesn't come into the midst
[1:57:01] of the
[1:57:03] people say okay we need to get all
[1:57:05] organized
[1:57:07] here you go here and you go
[1:57:10] there and so give us some space here to
[1:57:13] set up the
[1:57:15] Tabernacle that wasn't how it happened
[1:57:18] the Bible says Moses set up the
[1:57:20] Tabernacle a far off but he brought the
[1:57:25] he built the Tabernacle outside the
[1:57:31] camp and then he began to place the
[1:57:37] people around the
[1:57:40] word you see the word places the
[1:57:45] people now the first placing was the
[1:57:48] placing of the ministry
[1:57:53] they at the door to the
[1:57:57] Tabernacle we find Moses and Aaron
[1:57:59] dwelling
[1:58:01] there the messenger of the
[1:58:04] age and his
[1:58:06] representative and then all around the
[1:58:09] Tabernacle was was camped the
[1:58:14] ministry the
[1:58:16] Levites because it's always the Levites
[1:58:19] that carry the burden of the
[1:58:22] word and the word is a
[1:58:25] burden the word is a
[1:58:27] Ministry the word is something that must
[1:58:30] be dealt
[1:58:32] with it's not just here it is and
[1:58:34] believe whatever you
[1:58:37] want no the word is a revelation of God
[1:58:41] himself and God wants to dwell amongst
[1:58:44] his
[1:58:45] people but he doesn't dwell amongst his
[1:58:48] people the way you want him
[1:58:51] he dwells in his Heavenly
[1:58:55] order he has a Heavenly
[1:58:57] order and it takes the eyes of a prophet
[1:59:00] to reveal the Heavenly
[1:59:04] order that that Heavenly order would
[1:59:06] come into our
[1:59:09] lives and declare the glory of
[1:59:14] God because it's not the glory of
[1:59:17] man it's not the Glory of a
[1:59:20] church it's not a glory of a
[1:59:23] priesthood it's the glory of God
[1:59:27] himself he's declaring
[1:59:30] himself hallelujah hallelujah he's
[1:59:32] declaring himself
[1:59:36] bride
[1:59:38] amen now we lost our screen
[1:59:41] here there we are oh there it is now
[1:59:47] after he set the priesthood in order
[1:59:52] oh my we could really go through
[1:59:54] Ephesians 4
[1:59:55] now he sent gifts unto
[1:59:58] men Apostles prophets evangelists
[2:00:01] pastors and
[2:00:04] teachers for the work of the ministry
[2:00:07] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[2:00:10] what's
[2:00:11] edifying building up not tearing down
[2:00:16] building up amen for the until they all
[2:00:20] come into the measure of the fullness of
[2:00:22] the stature of
[2:00:27] Christ all right so first God
[2:00:29] establishes five-fold
[2:00:33] Ministry for the work of the
[2:00:37] ministry to bring the body into the
[2:00:40] stature of Jesus
[2:00:43] Christ amen amen so then Moses put the
[2:00:47] rest of the congregation in order
[2:00:49] [Music]
[2:00:52] and around the priesthood was camped the
[2:00:54] 12
[2:00:57] tribes this was according to the order
[2:01:00] that Moses saw in
[2:01:02] heaven because the tribes had certain
[2:01:08] symbols they were
[2:01:11] emblems all right give me the next one
[2:01:15] and the emblems of these
[2:01:18] tribes was the lion the ox the man and
[2:01:21] the
[2:01:25] eagle the lion the ox the man and the
[2:01:35] eagle why this is what Moses saw in
[2:01:40] heaven a lion AR a man and
[2:01:46] E so he says dan you go here
[2:01:50] Ephraim you go here Judah you go here
[2:01:54] Reuben you go here because it's a
[2:01:56] representation of what he saw in
[2:02:00] heaven are you with
[2:02:02] me now there's a purpose of
[2:02:05] this because these are protecting the
[2:02:08] word in their
[2:02:12] day because the enemy May attack the
[2:02:17] camp but what at the the center of the
[2:02:21] camp it's the
[2:02:23] Tabernacle and what's the
[2:02:25] Tabernacle it's
[2:02:27] [Music]
[2:02:29] you the purpose of the anointings is to
[2:02:32] protect
[2:02:35] you because you are God's Dwelling
[2:02:41] Place
[2:02:42] amen amen amen the
[2:02:46] enemy we've got some symbols here
[2:02:50] in the first four seals there's four
[2:02:52] horse
[2:02:56] horses one
[2:02:58] Rider Changing
[2:03:01] Horses The White Horse the red horse the
[2:03:06] Black Horse and the
[2:03:09] pale and when the right horse comes
[2:03:13] in the standard of the Lord is the lion
[2:03:17] anointing
[2:03:20] and when the red horse comes in he's
[2:03:23] against a different
[2:03:25] standard that's the ox
[2:03:27] anointing when the when the Black Horse
[2:03:30] comes
[2:03:31] in he's against the man
[2:03:34] anointing and when the Pale Horse the
[2:03:37] combination of all the powers of the
[2:03:40] horse and the Antichrist Spirit riding
[2:03:43] on the
[2:03:45] horse the greatest
[2:03:47] enemy the Bible says says hell follows
[2:03:49] after
[2:03:51] him the greatest anointing God sends in
[2:03:54] the
[2:03:56] church is the eagle
[2:04:02] anointing the greatest anointing to
[2:04:05] combat the greatest
[2:04:09] enemy these are also represented in the
[2:04:12] gospels Matthew Mark Luke and
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:17] John
[2:04:21] their character fits these
[2:04:24] anointings all right next
[2:04:30] one brother brandom says now we see that
[2:04:33] the devil
[2:04:38] changing four
[2:04:41] Beast meant that what power he revealed
[2:04:44] to the world and how they ended on this
[2:04:47] pale death
[2:05:00] now let's look at God's powers of these
[2:05:02] beasts to combat
[2:05:10] them and that's where I take my
[2:05:13] title
[2:05:15] combat he says when the Antichrist was
[2:05:18] right in with his false
[2:05:24] teaching God sent his teaching
[2:05:27] out the word the lion of the tribe of
[2:05:32] Judah which is the word made manifest in
[2:05:36] the Holy
[2:05:38] Spirit notice that
[2:05:41] statement the
[2:05:43] lion it's an
[2:05:47] anointing an anointing
[2:05:50] what is an
[2:05:52] anointing it's a word made manifest in
[2:05:55] the Holy
[2:06:00] Spirit we think the anointing is
[2:06:05] emotions we think the ano anointing is
[2:06:10] Sensations but that's not what an
[2:06:12] anointing
[2:06:14] is in Luke chapter
[2:06:16] 4 Jesus Takes the scroll and reads the
[2:06:21] scroll the spirit of the Lord is upon
[2:06:24] me to preach the
[2:06:27] gospel to loose the
[2:06:29] captives to mend the broken
[2:06:34] hearts to bring Deliverance to the
[2:06:39] captives and he finished the reading of
[2:06:42] the
[2:06:43] script and what did he
[2:06:46] do he sat down
[2:06:50] brother brandham says it this
[2:06:53] way we would think with the greatest
[2:06:56] anointing that was ever Upon A
[2:07:03] man that that man would run all over the
[2:07:06] room and dance and
[2:07:09] Shout that man under that anointing
[2:07:11] would run all over the room run around
[2:07:15] and dance and
[2:07:17] Shout
[2:07:22] because that's what we think anointing
[2:07:25] is but brother Brown says anointing is
[2:07:28] not
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:34] emotions anointing is supreme power in
[2:07:41] control knowing exactly what and
[2:07:47] how in other words words in an
[2:07:50] anointing comes
[2:07:53] Revelation and Revelation shows you
[2:07:56] exactly how to
[2:08:01] act and Jesus under the greatest
[2:08:05] anointing sat down and precious words
[2:08:09] proceeded from his
[2:08:12] mouth hallelujah hallelujah all right so
[2:08:16] he says this anointing
[2:08:19] the lion of the tribe of
[2:08:22] Judah which is the word made manifest in
[2:08:26] the Holy
[2:08:29] Spirit and a holy spirit there to
[2:08:31] manifest himself which is the
[2:08:38] word double emphasis
[2:08:41] here brother I'm showing you can't
[2:08:43] disconnect the word from the Holy
[2:08:47] Spirit
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:50] because the holy spirit is the
[2:08:53] word amen give me the next
[2:08:56] part that's the
[2:08:58] reason the early church had healings and
[2:09:02] miracles and vision and
[2:09:08] power is because it was the Living Word
[2:09:11] in the form of the
[2:09:17] Lion the lion of the tribe of Judah
[2:09:20] riding out to combat
[2:09:25] that says amen now you got
[2:09:29] it said he sends his power
[2:09:34] Antichrist and God sends his the
[2:09:40] word wait a
[2:09:42] minute wait a
[2:09:45] minute God sends his what
[2:09:50] his power what is his
[2:09:53] power the
[2:09:57] word amen
[2:10:05] amen all right no I think we missed
[2:10:07] something here go
[2:10:10] back all right we'll stop there for a
[2:10:14] moment just you can just turn the screen
[2:10:16] off thank
[2:10:17] you I'll come back to
[2:10:20] it now in Acts chapter 1 and verse
[2:10:26] 8 are you still with
[2:10:29] me all right in Acts chapter 1 and verse
[2:10:34] 8 it says but you shall receive
[2:10:38] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[2:10:42] upon
[2:10:44] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[2:10:48] both in Jerusalem
[2:10:51] Judea and
[2:10:53] Samaria and unto the other most parts of
[2:10:55] the
[2:10:57] Earth all right so these these four
[2:11:00] anointings Around The
[2:11:03] Throne are the power that God sends in
[2:11:06] the
[2:11:08] church all right the new
[2:11:11] birth God himself taking up
[2:11:16] residence he says and and to that new
[2:11:19] birth you shall receive
[2:11:22] power now the
[2:11:25] Pentecostals they just think it's just
[2:11:27] power when you holy got the Holy Ghost
[2:11:30] you got
[2:11:31] power no the power is the anointing that
[2:11:34] is sent to protect the
[2:11:37] [Music]
[2:11:39] word because the word has taken up
[2:11:41] residence in your
[2:11:43] soul and the enemy is going to attack
[2:11:46] that
[2:11:47] word but when the enemy comes in like
[2:11:50] the
[2:11:51] flag the spirit of the Lord raises up a
[2:11:55] standard and the standard in the first
[2:11:58] stage was the lion
[2:12:00] [Music]
[2:12:02] anointing the power of those
[2:12:06] anointings is identified by their by
[2:12:09] their
[2:12:11] standard
[2:12:15] amen God sends powers to combat the
[2:12:21] enemy now listen where's the greatest
[2:12:25] battle it's in your
[2:12:29] mind the enemy comes into your
[2:12:32] mind so then God sends his power to
[2:12:35] combat
[2:12:38] that oh wait till you see it
[2:12:41] tonight I I want to go right there
[2:12:45] now but let's just stay with the
[2:12:47] foundation
[2:12:50] let's just nail it
[2:12:53] down you going to help
[2:12:56] me we're going to nail this down so we
[2:13:00] know exactly where we're standing in
[2:13:02] this okay because the power is to combat
[2:13:06] the enemy in your
[2:13:11] mind it's not power to change who you
[2:13:15] are it's power to show show you who you
[2:13:20] [Music]
[2:13:21] are amen it's a
[2:13:24] Warfare and Corinthians Paul says in
[2:13:28] Corinthians though we walk in the
[2:13:31] flesh it's 2 Corinthians 10 and
[2:13:35] three though we walk in the flesh we do
[2:13:38] not war after the
[2:13:40] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[2:13:43] not
[2:13:45] carnal But Mighty through God
[2:13:49] to the pulling down of
[2:13:52] strongholds where are these
[2:13:54] strongholds are they in the government
[2:13:57] are they in the
[2:13:59] Vatican are they in hell no they're in
[2:14:02] your
[2:14:04] mind says casting down
[2:14:08] imaginations and every High
[2:14:11] thing that exalts itself against the
[2:14:14] knowledge of
[2:14:16] God and bringing into
[2:14:20] captivity remember these
[2:14:23] anointings are the power to do
[2:14:26] this bringing into
[2:14:30] captivity bringing into
[2:14:33] captivity every
[2:14:39] thought where's the
[2:14:41] battle in your
[2:14:44] thoughts bringing into captivity every
[2:14:47] thought
[2:14:49] because our minds are
[2:14:51] weak but God sends you an
[2:14:54] anointing to combat the evil
[2:14:57] thoughts that the devil puts in your
[2:15:01] mind somebody asked brother
[2:15:04] brandom said how can I tell the
[2:15:06] difference between my thoughts and the
[2:15:08] devil's
[2:15:10] thoughts and brother Bram says if it
[2:15:13] agrees if it disagrees with the word of
[2:15:16] God Devil's
[2:15:19] thoughts if it agrees with the word of
[2:15:22] God it's God's
[2:15:26] thoughts hallelujah hallelujah your mind
[2:15:29] is where the battle
[2:15:31] is your mind is where the battle is the
[2:15:35] battle is in your
[2:15:40] mind hallelujah hallelujah but God sends
[2:15:43] an
[2:15:44] anointing against what the Antichrist is
[2:15:47] trying to
[2:15:50] do in your
[2:15:54] mind bringing into captivity every
[2:15:59] thought to The Obedience of
[2:16:03] Christ the
[2:16:06] word hallelujah hallelujah let's use an
[2:16:11] example you might be sick this
[2:16:15] morning and the devil's saying you
[2:16:19] you're going to be sick a long
[2:16:24] time the devil's saying you're a bad
[2:16:29] person the devil's saying you deserve to
[2:16:31] be
[2:16:37] sick the devil's telling you you can't
[2:16:39] be
[2:16:42] healed he might even he might even use a
[2:16:46] doctor to tell you there's no hope for
[2:16:54] you but that thought is brought into
[2:16:58] captivity to The Obedience of the word
[2:17:01] of
[2:17:03] God for by his stripes you are
[2:17:08] healed
[2:17:11] Hallelujah now there's no there's no
[2:17:14] difference in the
[2:17:16] sacrifice
[2:17:18] oh if you could catch this you'll catch
[2:17:20] it tonight but if you could catch this
[2:17:24] now there's no difference to the
[2:17:28] atonement there's no difference to the
[2:17:30] reality of the
[2:17:33] promise the promise doesn't
[2:17:36] change the word doesn't
[2:17:39] change what needs to change is your
[2:17:44] thoughts to line up with the word of God
[2:17:50] as brother Bram said it the right
[2:17:53] attitude towards any Divine promise will
[2:17:57] bring it to
[2:18:00] [Music]
[2:18:03] pass hallelujah
[2:18:07] hallelujah so when the Antichrist was
[2:18:11] writing with his false
[2:18:15] teaching God sent out his te shout out
[2:18:18] the
[2:18:20] word the devil sends his
[2:18:23] power God sends his power the
[2:18:27] word amen and there in the book of
[2:18:30] Acts chapter 2 when God sent the Holy
[2:18:34] Ghost and they were born
[2:18:36] again and as Jesus said and then they
[2:18:39] received
[2:18:41] power those that were
[2:18:44] cowards became
[2:18:46] lions
[2:18:48] amen they moved out under the power of
[2:18:50] the Holy
[2:18:52] Spirit and said these men are not drunk
[2:18:55] as you
[2:18:57] suppose but this is that which was
[2:19:00] spoken by the
[2:19:02] prophet I pour out my spirit in the last
[2:19:06] days your sons and your daughters will
[2:19:11] prophesy their young men shall see
[2:19:14] Visions their old men will dream dreams
[2:19:19] this day this scripture
[2:19:20] [Applause]
[2:19:23] isah what was it the word
[2:19:26] manifest the anointing of the
[2:19:29] hour identified the word
[2:19:33] manifest hallelujah hallelujah they they
[2:19:36] went out from
[2:19:38] there and conquered that
[2:19:41] age under that Fearless lion
[2:19:46] anointing
[2:19:48] all
[2:19:48] right now that was the first
[2:19:52] seal the white horse
[2:19:54] rider in combat against the lion
[2:19:58] [Music]
[2:19:59] anointing but then came the Dark
[2:20:03] Ages the second
[2:20:05] seal and the devil the Antichrist
[2:20:09] changed his
[2:20:11] horse changed his
[2:20:13] power changed his false
[2:20:16] anointing as he stepped onto the red
[2:20:19] horse and the Bible says that power was
[2:20:23] given to
[2:20:25] him to take peace from the
[2:20:28] Earth all right now what
[2:20:32] happened why don't you put the slideshow
[2:20:34] back up for
[2:20:38] me slide number five I think it
[2:20:44] is all right
[2:20:50] all right no stop at the first paragraph
[2:20:53] there we go now the second
[2:20:55] beast that the Antichrist sent out was a
[2:20:58] red horse Red
[2:21:02] Beast that he rode on to take peace from
[2:21:05] the
[2:21:07] earth and
[2:21:09] War now the second one that went out to
[2:21:12] combat him was the ox
[2:21:16] Beast
[2:21:19] [Music]
[2:21:21] amen it means a labor a beast of
[2:21:27] [Music]
[2:21:29] burden all right let's look at what
[2:21:32] happened the enemy now went out to
[2:21:36] destroy to kill in the
[2:21:40] natural and 68 million Martyrs gave
[2:21:43] their
[2:21:46] lives
[2:21:55] all right now these these Martyrs what
[2:21:58] what happened
[2:22:00] here they were not Anointed with the
[2:22:02] lion anointing
[2:22:08] anymore they were not the Bold Fearless
[2:22:13] group did they become
[2:22:16] cowards
[2:22:19] did the Lions become
[2:22:22] cowards no the anointing
[2:22:27] changed they who went throughout the
[2:22:29] world
[2:22:30] fearlessly protected under that
[2:22:37] anointing now in this
[2:22:39] age they freely gave their
[2:22:43] lives for the testimony of the word of
[2:22:46] God
[2:22:48] they freely were burned at the
[2:22:52] stake fed to wild
[2:22:55] animals they were saw
[2:22:58] aunder all manner of
[2:23:02] death they were anointed to do
[2:23:05] that the seed must fall into the ground
[2:23:08] and
[2:23:10] die there was a purpose that God
[2:23:14] has as the as the bridegroom seed fell
[2:23:18] into the
[2:23:20] ground now the bride seed falls into the
[2:23:24] ground but it will come out
[2:23:27] again under Luther Wesley and
[2:23:31] Pentecost all right so they were they
[2:23:34] were Martyrs give me the
[2:23:39] next that shows that the th tyan
[2:23:43] age after the Antichrist got settled
[2:23:46] down
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:51] and they come into the thra
[2:23:53] age the little church could do nothing
[2:23:56] but just simply
[2:23:59] labor and another thing the ox is also a
[2:24:04] beast of
[2:24:07] sacrifice see they give their
[2:24:11] lives just as freely as they could give
[2:24:16] them all right next
[2:24:19] one goes on here the martyrs down
[2:24:22] Through the Ages there suffered
[2:24:32] terribly I'm sorry I cannot change the
[2:24:34] word
[2:24:35] martyrs you'll get it the martyrs
[2:24:39] suffered
[2:24:41] but the martyrs
[2:24:44] suffered but what were they listen now
[2:24:48] they were under the
[2:24:52] inspiration the spirit of God the
[2:24:57] power now here here's a
[2:25:00] key and he says don't forget this
[2:25:03] church and you Brethren on
[2:25:09] tape I want you to examine
[2:25:13] this who's he talking
[2:25:15] to you you get all right he says how
[2:25:20] could man do anything else besides the
[2:25:23] power of God that had been relased to
[2:25:28] [Music]
[2:25:31] them see when you look at it through the
[2:25:33] human
[2:25:35] mind you think what's wrong with these
[2:25:38] people didn't they have the Holy
[2:25:40] Ghost they're not acting like they did
[2:25:43] in the first
[2:25:45] age now they're all being
[2:25:48] murdered they're giving their
[2:25:50] lives is there something wrong with
[2:25:53] them no it was the baptism of the Holy
[2:25:55] Ghost through every
[2:25:58] age the new birth is the
[2:26:02] same the difference is the
[2:26:05] anointing the difference is the power
[2:26:08] that is sent into the
[2:26:11] church so brother random says how could
[2:26:14] man do anything else besides the power
[2:26:17] of God that's released to
[2:26:22] [Music]
[2:26:24] them amen amen he say he says now I'm
[2:26:29] going to put a box up here to represent
[2:26:34] that I put it on the slide but it's not
[2:26:36] relevant to what we're saying the next
[2:26:39] sentence is what I want to get to no no
[2:26:41] stay there go back all right he says
[2:26:44] here if God sends a certain Spirit among
[2:26:50] them that's the only thing they can work
[2:26:56] by this is a principle
[2:26:59] here when God sends his power into the
[2:27:02] church a specific
[2:27:05] anointing that's the only thing that
[2:27:08] they can work
[2:27:11] by is the spirit that works among
[2:27:15] them amen amen all right next one
[2:27:20] now now will prove you to you by the
[2:27:24] history of the
[2:27:27] church and by the opening of the
[2:27:31] seals and the powers that let
[2:27:35] loose and watch
[2:27:39] exactly the church responded to the
[2:27:42] anointing and they couldn't do nothing
[2:27:45] else
[2:27:53] amen let's go let's keep going and they
[2:27:56] didn't
[2:27:57] care because the spirit of the church in
[2:28:00] that day was
[2:28:05] sacrificed listen you don't understand
[2:28:07] what they went
[2:28:09] through because you're under a different
[2:28:13] anointing but they were anointed to do
[2:28:15] that
[2:28:17] it says they brother said they walked up
[2:28:19] just as freely as they could
[2:28:23] walk they were Anointed with the true
[2:28:26] spirit of God for that
[2:28:31] age and they died like Heroes of
[2:28:36] sacrifice thousands times
[2:28:40] thousands 68 million of them on the
[2:28:45] record
[2:28:48] o
[2:28:50] sacrifice
[2:28:55] amen all
[2:28:57] right you can take it down now turn it
[2:29:01] off thank you we'll go we'll go to the
[2:29:04] next slide in a
[2:29:06] moment because I want you to notice now
[2:29:08] that something
[2:29:10] changes actually I'm sorry put it back
[2:29:12] up we we'll read the next
[2:29:14] portion all right
[2:29:17] hallelujah it's the last one the next
[2:29:20] thing that went out to combat that was a
[2:29:23] beast with the face of a
[2:29:30] man smart
[2:29:35] educated now what does that tell
[2:29:38] us the anointing was to
[2:29:44] education under this an
[2:29:48] anointing I'll just I'll just drop this
[2:29:52] in that's why in the last anointing the
[2:29:56] eagle God used a prophet with only a
[2:30:00] seventh grade
[2:30:03] education because under the eagle the
[2:30:06] anointing is no longer to
[2:30:11] education all right so now we see he
[2:30:13] says a man
[2:30:15] anointing
[2:30:17] smart educated
[2:30:20] shrew
[2:30:22] fine Anointed with the spirit of that
[2:30:28] day amen all right next notice idolatry
[2:30:34] brought the man
[2:30:36] Beast went forth with the power of God
[2:30:40] by the wisdom of
[2:30:45] God
[2:30:59] wisdom that God gave
[2:31:03] him and brought the church from idolatry
[2:31:06] back to
[2:31:09] God all right now you can put it
[2:31:13] down all right now let's look at that
[2:31:16] age
[2:31:18] okay who was Martin
[2:31:21] Luther he was a highly educated Catholic
[2:31:29] monk who was John
[2:31:32] Wesley he was a highly educated Anglican
[2:31:40] priest they were moving under the
[2:31:42] anointing of a
[2:31:45] man now now let's go back to Martin
[2:31:49] Luther just to show you the transition
[2:31:52] or the change from the ox anointing to
[2:31:55] the man
[2:32:00] anointing as Martin Luther was as Martin
[2:32:03] Luther was studying the word of
[2:32:05] God in particular The Book of
[2:32:08] Romans God began to anoint his word in a
[2:32:12] fresh
[2:32:15] way and the Holy Spirit began to deal
[2:32:17] with Martin
[2:32:20] Luther who had been taught that it was
[2:32:23] by works you attain
[2:32:28] salvation but he could never attain
[2:32:30] peace in
[2:32:32] that why not there was a seed Gene in
[2:32:37] there and it was had a deep
[2:32:41] calling and there had to be a deep to
[2:32:43] respond to that
[2:32:45] call
[2:32:47] and so he went where to the word of
[2:32:51] God and he began to see the
[2:32:54] word and the just shall live by
[2:32:58] faith hallelujah hallelujah till Martin
[2:33:01] SL slogan became the word
[2:33:04] alone the word
[2:33:07] alone faith
[2:33:10] alone grace
[2:33:12] alone no Works
[2:33:15] involved why because God was opening
[2:33:17] something up
[2:33:20] here now Luther was not the first one to
[2:33:23] see
[2:33:25] this matter of fact as he studied the
[2:33:28] teachings of a man by John
[2:33:34] hus John hus was born or ministered a
[2:33:38] hundred years before
[2:33:43] Luther and John hus taught the same
[2:33:46] thing that Luther
[2:33:50] taught why didn't John hus cause the
[2:33:58] Reformation he was under an O
[2:34:02] anointing and John hus was burned at the
[2:34:05] stake for what he
[2:34:11] taught he was burned he was you just say
[2:34:14] he was burned yeah yeah
[2:34:21] he was tied to a post and
[2:34:24] burned but you know many of the martyrs
[2:34:26] said you don't have to tie
[2:34:29] me I'll just stand
[2:34:32] here why they were
[2:34:36] anointed anointed to give their
[2:34:39] lives all right listen
[2:34:41] now on as he was
[2:34:45] dying John hus cried
[2:34:48] out all right now hope you remember the
[2:34:52] words John hus means
[2:34:56] Goose all right and he said you can cook
[2:34:59] this
[2:35:02] Goose but there's coming a
[2:35:05] swan that you won't be able to
[2:35:10] cook hallelujah hallelujah he was
[2:35:15] prophesying and 100 years
[2:35:17] later the family called
[2:35:22] Luther had on their emblem a
[2:35:31] swan
[2:35:34] and and Martin Luther moved under the
[2:35:37] inspiration of the
[2:35:40] word and began to preach the just shall
[2:35:43] live by
[2:35:44] faith
[2:35:47] and he and he was called to the council
[2:35:49] by the Roman Catholic
[2:35:53] church and at the council it was
[2:35:57] ruled Martin Luther is a
[2:36:01] heretic he is in
[2:36:05] error his teaching is false
[2:36:09] teaching and the emperor of the Roman
[2:36:13] Empire said from this day
[2:36:17] anybody that finds Martin
[2:36:19] Luther sees Martin
[2:36:21] Luther will kill Martin
[2:36:24] Luther Martin Luther was sentenced to
[2:36:29] death but he never
[2:36:31] died why the anointing had
[2:36:37] [Music]
[2:36:40] changed John hus was under an ox's
[2:36:44] anointing
[2:36:46] but Martin Luther was under a man
[2:36:51] anointing because the time had moved
[2:36:55] forward I will restore sayth the
[2:36:59] Lord all that the Palmer
[2:37:01] worm the canker worm the caterpillar the
[2:37:05] Locust have
[2:37:07] eaten I will
[2:37:09] restore it was the beginning of the
[2:37:12] restoration hallelujah hallelujah the
[2:37:16] Roman Church couldn't touch
[2:37:18] him because God has sent an anointing
[2:37:21] into the
[2:37:23] church to bring the word back to
[2:37:27] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah God was
[2:37:32] restoring hallelujah
[2:37:34] hallelujah and and Martin Luther
[2:37:37] teaching
[2:37:40] justification brought the church out of
[2:37:43] idolatry but that wasn't all the the
[2:37:47] restoration God was restoring the life
[2:37:49] of the
[2:37:51] believer bringing the church out of form
[2:37:55] being
[2:37:56] [Music]
[2:37:58] formal that and Mar and John Wesley
[2:38:00] began to preach a Sanctified
[2:38:04] life that you are Sanctified by the
[2:38:07] blood of Jesus
[2:38:09] Christ a consecrated
[2:38:13] life what was God doing
[2:38:16] it was a move of God it was a move of
[2:38:19] God under
[2:38:20] Luther it was a move of God under
[2:38:23] Wesley it was a move of God under
[2:38:27] Pentecost it was God bringing the church
[2:38:31] out of
[2:38:33] death and bringing them to the fullness
[2:38:36] of the
[2:38:39] life hallelujah hallelujah it wasn't an
[2:38:42] event it was a
[2:38:44] journey
[2:38:47] hallelujah hallelujah he said brother
[2:38:50] now this isn't on a slide so now I'm
[2:38:51] just going to quote you Hallelujah take
[2:38:53] a
[2:38:54] drink have some
[2:39:01] water all right here's brother brandham
[2:39:05] now he says when the wlans come along
[2:39:07] with their
[2:39:10] [Music]
[2:39:12] Revival they said we don't need you luin
[2:39:18] anymore but did you know the very life
[2:39:21] that was in the blade made the
[2:39:28] [Music]
[2:39:29] tossle all right so now brother R was
[2:39:32] talking about the wheat
[2:39:35] plant the seed
[2:39:38] goes the sea goes into the ground and
[2:39:42] dies and the first thing to come out is
[2:39:44] a little a little
[2:39:47] shoot a blade of
[2:39:49] grass now remember Matthew
[2:39:53] 25 are you with
[2:39:56] me is this too much for
[2:39:59] you all right we keep going so the shoot
[2:40:03] come out of the
[2:40:04] ground now in Matthew
[2:40:07] 25 the parable of the weed in the
[2:40:12] tears it says that the weed and the
[2:40:15] tears came up
[2:40:18] together in the original shoot that
[2:40:21] comes out of the
[2:40:23] ground it's like a blade of
[2:40:26] grass you can't tell them
[2:40:29] apart and the and the angel said should
[2:40:31] we separate
[2:40:34] them oh we can spend a lot of time on
[2:40:37] Luther's day right
[2:40:38] now and the fanaticism that causes the
[2:40:41] Revival that enters the
[2:40:44] Revival
[2:40:46] the Angels were said don't separate
[2:40:50] them don't separate the fanaticism from
[2:40:52] the
[2:40:54] Revival don't separate the false from
[2:40:56] the
[2:40:58] true but in the Harvest Time in the last
[2:41:02] days there will be sent an
[2:41:05] anointing that will cause a
[2:41:10] separation but under Luther's day they
[2:41:13] grow side by side
[2:41:16] all right then the plant grows into the
[2:41:20] tossel and it's the life that was in the
[2:41:23] blade that goes into the
[2:41:28] tossel and that tossel represented
[2:41:32] Wesley now let's go back to what brother
[2:41:34] brand was talking
[2:41:36] about he said the very life that was in
[2:41:40] the blade made the
[2:41:41] [Music]
[2:41:44] toss
[2:41:47] it can't go no further until it uses the
[2:41:52] blade he said it's a PO it's a
[2:41:56] pollen and shakes off of itself into the
[2:42:03] blade and then comes out and then comes
[2:42:06] out the
[2:42:08] ear or you might call it the head of the
[2:42:14] grain he said
[2:42:16] he says that was the
[2:42:19] Pentecostal the restoration of the gifts
[2:42:21] coming back into the
[2:42:25] church now the ear can't look back and
[2:42:28] say tossel I have no need of
[2:42:33] you or of the
[2:42:35] [Music]
[2:42:38] blade because it takes the blade and the
[2:42:41] tossle to make the
[2:42:44] ear
[2:42:50] all right so brother ROM's describing
[2:42:52] something to us
[2:42:54] here he's saying now he's not talking
[2:42:57] about
[2:42:59] farming he's talking about the
[2:43:03] church he says Luther was the first life
[2:43:06] to come out of the
[2:43:09] sea it was
[2:43:12] life but then Wesley come along
[2:43:16] and says you don't have
[2:43:17] life we don't need you now
[2:43:22] listen if Luther didn't have
[2:43:25] life then Wesley doesn't have
[2:43:30] life because the life that was in Luther
[2:43:33] moved into a different form in
[2:43:39] Wesley and then Along come the
[2:43:43] Pentecostals and the life that was in
[2:43:45] the Pentecostals was first in
[2:43:49] Wesley it's moving into a different
[2:43:54] form and the Pentecostals could not say
[2:43:56] we have no need of justification and no
[2:43:58] need of
[2:44:01] [Music]
[2:44:03] sanctification it's the same life in a
[2:44:06] further
[2:44:09] form hallelujah hallelujah all right so
[2:44:14] brother Ram says we can see these things
[2:44:17] [Music]
[2:44:18] now that the ear is
[2:44:23] ripe he says and it ends at the end time
[2:44:27] at the time of the
[2:44:30] end and he says I know we got a lot of
[2:44:32] fungus on this
[2:44:34] ear but it's still an ear just the
[2:44:39] same we got a lot of ins and
[2:44:44] outs little
[2:44:53] ISS in and
[2:44:57] out he says but God will shave that all
[2:45:00] off one of these
[2:45:06] days now listen watch what he says here
[2:45:11] and he will have a perfect ear of corn
[2:45:14] one of the these
[2:45:19] days he says Luther Wesley Pentecost
[2:45:23] were not
[2:45:29] perfect but it's the same Holy
[2:45:32] Spirit but then at the end
[2:45:36] time hallelujah hallelujah God is going
[2:45:39] to bring it to its
[2:45:43] Perfection Hallelujah
[2:45:46] Hallelujah can I keep
[2:45:49] going maybe we should
[2:45:53] close nobody's here
[2:45:57] anymore everybody's
[2:46:00] quiet should we go or
[2:46:05] stop go most of are for
[2:46:08] go the Baptist say
[2:46:14] stop
[2:46:16] praise the
[2:46:18] Lord if you're a Baptist don't be
[2:46:22] offended we're all coming into the
[2:46:24] fullness of the
[2:46:27] word all
[2:46:32] right my my
[2:46:41] my okay all right
[2:46:47] now in the opening of the
[2:46:53] seals brother bam describes these
[2:46:56] four living
[2:47:01] creatures these four
[2:47:06] powers they have a purpose as we've
[2:47:08] already
[2:47:11] described but brother Ram spent time
[2:47:14] showing us what the lion anointing
[2:47:20] did he showed us what the ox anointing
[2:47:26] did he showed us what the man anointing
[2:47:32] did but he never showed us what the
[2:47:34] eagle anointing
[2:47:38] did because the opening of the
[2:47:42] seals was the change between the man
[2:47:45] anointing and the eagle
[2:47:50] anointing the eagle anointing was not
[2:47:56] history the eagle anointing was
[2:48:01] future from the time of the opening of
[2:48:04] the
[2:48:06] seals until this time the church has
[2:48:09] been under the eagle
[2:48:13] anointing I want to go into that
[2:48:17] tonight but but I want you to see
[2:48:19] something
[2:48:20] here if you don't see a change of
[2:48:24] anointings you'll miss a lot that's in
[2:48:27] the
[2:48:28] message you have to
[2:48:31] understand that brother Brandon preached
[2:48:33] under a man
[2:48:36] anointing though he was a prophet the
[2:48:39] church was under a man
[2:48:41] anointing until the time of the opening
[2:48:44] of the SE
[2:48:46] SE and then in the opening of the
[2:48:49] seals the church comes under an eagle
[2:48:53] anointing and if you don't understand
[2:48:55] what that's
[2:48:57] for if you don't understand the corner
[2:49:00] that's been
[2:49:02] turn you'll think you're still living
[2:49:04] under a man
[2:49:07] anointing in the second
[2:49:09] age the second anointing the AR
[2:49:13] anointing they couldn't look back to the
[2:49:16] lion
[2:49:18] anointing and say why aren't we more
[2:49:20] like they were
[2:49:21] [Music]
[2:49:22] then why don't we have the same power
[2:49:25] they had in the day of
[2:49:30] Pentecost they had the Holy Ghost but
[2:49:33] the power was
[2:49:35] changed amen they couldn't ex they
[2:49:38] couldn't do anything but respond to the
[2:49:40] power that was given to
[2:49:43] them
[2:49:46] they couldn't live anywhere anyway
[2:49:49] else they could look back they could
[2:49:53] look
[2:49:54] backwards and say oh we need to try and
[2:49:56] be more like
[2:49:58] that but they would never be able to be
[2:50:01] like
[2:50:02] that unless it was
[2:50:06] intellectual intellectual they they
[2:50:08] could look at the
[2:50:11] history but by the spirit of God they
[2:50:15] were under an ox
[2:50:18] anointing hallelujah hallelujah they
[2:50:20] looked into the word of
[2:50:22] God the same word that
[2:50:26] Peter
[2:50:27] John that Paul
[2:50:29] preached they looked at the same word by
[2:50:33] a different
[2:50:34] anointing and it manifested the way it
[2:50:37] did in their
[2:50:39] lives because of the anointing they're
[2:50:42] under amen
[2:50:45] now Luther Wesley and the
[2:50:48] Pentecostal they couldn't look back to
[2:50:50] the arc
[2:50:52] age and say we should be sacrificing Our
[2:50:57] Lives we must not be real
[2:51:00] Believers we must not have the Holy
[2:51:03] Ghost nobody's killing
[2:51:09] us cuz they look to the previous
[2:51:13] age and that's what happened under a
[2:51:16] previous
[2:51:17] anointing now it's not saying that
[2:51:19] nobody died for the
[2:51:23] gospel people still will die for the
[2:51:26] gospel but that's not the
[2:51:29] anointing that's not what the church was
[2:51:31] called
[2:51:33] to they were called to take this
[2:51:36] word by the anointing of their
[2:51:39] age bring the church out of
[2:51:43] idolatry into the absoluteness of the
[2:51:46] word of
[2:51:49] God hallelujah
[2:51:54] hallelujah they couldn't say Oh we must
[2:51:56] not have the Holy
[2:52:01] Ghost cuz we're not acting like they
[2:52:03] acted in the in the Dark
[2:52:07] Ages no they had the Holy
[2:52:10] Ghost they had the Holy
[2:52:12] Ghost but it was a an
[2:52:18] anointing
[2:52:21] now what came under the man
[2:52:26] anointing what manifested under the man
[2:52:32] anointing all kinds of isms all kinds of
[2:52:35] uh outward
[2:52:43] manifestations not just justification

[2:52:55] more than that see under the man
[2:52:58] anointing is where altar calls come
[2:53:02] from did you know that doesn't come from
[2:53:05] the book of
[2:53:13] Acts
[2:53:25] all kinds of evidences came out of the
[2:53:27] man
[2:53:28] anointing
[2:53:43] evidences Wesley's time they had the
[2:53:48] Shakers people would get under the Holy
[2:53:50] Ghost and they would
[2:53:53] Shake people would get under the Holy
[2:53:55] Ghost and they would
[2:53:57] shout under the Holy Ghost they would
[2:53:59] pass
[2:54:01] out and they throw water on
[2:54:04] them speak in tongues under the
[2:54:08] Pentecostals till they would say if you
[2:54:10] don't speak in tongues you don't have
[2:54:12] the Holy
[2:54:13] Ghost kinds of outward
[2:54:18] manifestations but that was the man
[2:54:26] anointing I don't want to hurt anybody's
[2:54:29] feelings but we are not restored to the
[2:54:32] man

[2:54:54] church amen but we've moved into a
[2:54:57] different
[2:54:59] anointing we're living in a different
[2:55:03] hour we now we can't look
[2:55:06] back at the man
[2:55:09] anointing and say oh how come I don't
[2:55:12] shake like they shook under the man
[2:55:13] anointing
[2:55:18] [Music]

[2:55:27] Ghost how come I don't dance like they
[2:55:29] did Under The Man

[2:55:38] dancing I believe the Holy Spirit can
[2:55:41] strike a man and he can
[2:55:43] dance
[2:55:45] but it's no evidence of
[2:55:49] anything amen I believe that a man can
[2:55:51] dance in the
[2:55:52] spirit and I believe a man can dance in
[2:55:55] the

[2:56:09] feelings but I'm going to tell you
[2:56:12] straight there is no dancing mentioned
[2:56:15] in the bible after the book of
[2:56:26] Acts you want to dance
[2:56:30] dance I love to see people get so
[2:56:32] inspired with
[2:56:36] God that they just love to
[2:56:39] dance praise the Lord but if someone
[2:56:42] doesn't dance it doesn't mean they don't
[2:56:44] have the Holy

[3:01:12] Ezekiel and say what are you talking

[3:01:22] age it's the divine revelation of Jesus
[3:01:28] Christ one might say the other one
[3:01:30] didn't have the right
[3:01:33] Revelation but the Revelation is tied to
[3:01:36] the age that you're living

[3:01:44] revelation for this

[3:03:29] the and the corn of wheat of Christ had
[3:03:32] to fall into the

[3:04:03] ground must die or it cannot reproduce
[3:04:08] [Music]
[3:04:10] itself the great church that he
[3:04:12] established on the day of
[3:04:16] Pentecost by the sending of the Holy
[3:04:19] Ghost had to suffer
[3:04:22] murom he had to suffer
[3:04:30] martyrdom had to suffer martyrdom had to
[3:04:32] be

[3:04:59] Christ in this last
[3:05:03] day hallelujah hallelujah rising of the
[3:05:06] sun he says that's Divine the divine
[3:05:09] revelation of the word made
[3:05:12] flesh
[3:05:17] it was made flesh in that day by the
[3:05:22] Sun the
[3:05:24] groom it's of Flesh today by the
[3:05:29] bride John 1 and verse one one and verse
[3:05:33] one of John in the beginning was the
[3:05:36] word verse 14 and the Word was made
[3:05:40] flesh and dwell Among
[3:05:42] Us and I'll say this in the beginning
[3:05:46] was the
[3:05:47] word and now the word is being made
[3:05:50] flesh to dwell amongst us
[3:05:53] again hallelujah
[3:05:56] hallelujah we're coming to a close
[3:06:01] here brother brandom says in
[3:06:06] 1954 way back in
[3:06:11] 1954 he says
[3:06:14] what I'm trying to tell you what I'm
[3:06:16] trying to do is get to the Pentecostal
[3:06:23] people to let them realize who they
[3:06:30] are if you only knew who you was
[3:06:35] tonight there'd come such a spontaneous
[3:06:38] world of
[3:06:41] Faith through
[3:06:43] here till there wouldn't be a sick
[3:06:51] person listen what he's saying this is
[3:06:54] in the beginning of the
[3:06:56] ministry what I'm trying to
[3:06:59] do is to get you to see who you
[3:07:02] are now if he's trying to do that for
[3:07:04] the
[3:07:06] Pentecostals what's the problem they
[3:07:09] don't see who they
[3:07:12] are
[3:07:13] because if they saw who they
[3:07:15] were he said there'd be such a
[3:07:18] spontaneous move of
[3:07:21] faith that every sick person would
[3:07:25] be now I want to say that was under the
[3:07:29] man
[3:07:31] anointing but do you
[3:07:33] realize that the purpose of the eagle
[3:07:37] anointing is to show you who you
[3:07:42] are he goes on in 1954 and he said
[3:07:45] there'd be no need of having a prayer
[3:07:49] line if the people who's here realize
[3:07:53] who they
[3:07:55] are that's the only way you can do
[3:07:59] it how do you think it is in the foreign
[3:08:05] Nations walking against demons and
[3:08:07] powers and
[3:08:12] everything you have to know where you're
[3:08:17] standing Satan don't care how loud you
[3:08:22] holler Satan don't care how much you
[3:08:25] jump up and
[3:08:28] down Satan will lay right
[3:08:31] there but he has to recognize
[3:08:37] Faith how does faith
[3:08:40] come faith comes by hearing the word
[3:08:45] he has to recognize
[3:08:48] Faith it'll move him every
[3:08:52] time and that's where it is
[3:08:56] today the church has got the
[3:09:00] blessing but they don't know
[3:09:02] it let's let us pray Heavenly
[3:09:07] Father we stop there for this
[3:09:11] morning Lord I pray that you'll just
[3:09:13] take the foundational service this
[3:09:16] morning may we may we digest it into our
[3:09:22] hearts Lord come again in the next
[3:09:25] service if you would
[3:09:27] T and bring us into the fullness of what
[3:09:31] you have brought in this
[3:09:33] hour we commit this service to you in
[3:09:37] Jesus Christ's
[3:09:38] name amen
[3:09:41] amen
[3:10:04] amen the Lord hand of
[3:10:07] [Applause]
[3:10:11] praise
[3:10:13] he has brought the four living
[3:10:16] creatures all the way from the church in
[3:10:19] the
[3:10:21] wilderness amen and he has placed them
[3:10:24] exactly where they
[3:10:27] belong in Revelation chapter
[3:10:30] 4 brother Branham says they were now
[3:10:34] settled around the
[3:10:38] throne because the church was at
[3:10:41] home but it in Ezekiel chapter
[3:10:45] 1 you know they were moving with
[3:10:49] ar of the Covenant the anointing of the
[3:10:53] Holy
[3:10:54] Spirit goes with the
[3:10:57] word
[3:10:59] everywhere in every age are you together
[3:11:02] with me so we see that all those four
[3:11:06] living
[3:11:08] creatures with just different
[3:11:11] anointings
[3:11:13] that was necessary to operate at a
[3:11:15] certain
[3:11:18] time and so we saw that in the first
[3:11:21] three Church
[3:11:24] Ages which represented the uh first
[3:11:29] seal the
[3:11:31] word you know had to come
[3:11:36] forth as the lion of the tribe of
[3:11:39] Judah the anointing that they wanted
[3:11:42] they needed against the
[3:11:46] Antichrist and when the enemy held a
[3:11:49] SW in the Church of
[3:11:53] the the Holy Spirit poured down the
[3:11:56] anointing of
[3:11:59] anox it's the same Holy
[3:12:01] Spirit in the first one there it was
[3:12:05] holding the
[3:12:06] word from in the next one here God by
[3:12:11] the same Hol
[3:12:14] but a different
[3:12:16] anointing allowed them to give
[3:12:18] themselves
[3:12:20] over amen as
[3:12:22] sacrifice for the sake of the
[3:12:25] word then he has also told us after that
[3:12:30] came the man
[3:12:32] anointed which was the age of the
[3:12:36] Reformation we're running from sadis
[3:12:40] Philadelphia and leod
[3:12:44] amen there was a man anointing
[3:12:47] there intelligence of a
[3:12:50] man amen but then after that after the
[3:12:54] opening of the seals we are entering now
[3:12:58] into the
[3:13:00] bridge and now that's where God pourers
[3:13:04] the eego
[3:13:05] anointing amen he has told us the lion
[3:13:10] season or the lion seal
[3:13:17] amen that children of God were you know
[3:13:20] uh giving themselves out they were
[3:13:22] sewing
[3:13:24] seed in the next one the seed had to die
[3:13:29] in the
[3:13:30] ground under the O
[3:13:32] anointing under the man anointing the
[3:13:35] plant is standing
[3:13:37] again but under the ego anointing we are
[3:13:41] back to the seed again
[3:13:44] amen we need to keep under our seed
[3:13:47] anointing of the
[3:13:49] edge amen it takes us back into the full
[3:13:53] restoration of the
[3:13:56] world Alpha and
[3:13:58] Omega the thing coming
[3:14:01] together and when we are under that
[3:14:04] anointing of the our day there's no
[3:14:09] argument those things Sease
[3:14:13] in Maya the brother spoke about uh I
[3:14:16] will not say that because you are going
[3:14:18] to say it in the evening praise the Lord
[3:14:21] so under the
[3:14:22] anointing of our day if our faith is
[3:14:26] restored
[3:14:29] back under the origin I mean under the
[3:14:32] anointing of our
[3:14:34] age then it can only bring us
[3:14:37] back to the original
[3:14:41] seat
[3:14:43] the ideas of
[3:14:44] man which started in the man
[3:14:48] age we should not put a
[3:14:51] lot of concern over
[3:14:55] them you see there was the organization
[3:14:57] of the
[3:14:58] Quakers the
[3:15:01] Quakers okay qu quer quers
[3:15:07] qu qu you see this was an
[3:15:11] organization
[3:15:14] they come together and they believe that
[3:15:18] when the Holy Ghost comes you begin to
[3:15:25] quck and now this is the
[3:15:28] problem when people come into the
[3:15:31] message they come with elements of their
[3:15:34] old
[3:15:39] religions and now we start seeing people
[3:15:41] in the m
[3:15:44] the origin is the
[3:15:51] quers and they say you are not slain in
[3:15:55] the Holy
[3:16:01] Spirit it was not in the book of
[3:16:04] Acts and that's where we are being
[3:16:07] restored
[3:16:08] back we are not being restored the
[3:16:12] Pentecost as an
[3:16:15] organization where they had elements of
[3:16:19] quers dancing in the
[3:16:25] spirit it was not there those elements
[3:16:30] they come now in the age of
[3:16:38] man the
[3:16:41] evidence
[3:16:43] of the holy spirit is the word being
[3:16:48] made
[3:16:49] manifest in the life of a
[3:16:52] man whether you've danced or you not
[3:16:56] danced whether you are
[3:16:59] quing or you are not
[3:17:07] quing I don't know who told the
[3:17:10] people that when the Holy Ghost
[3:17:13] comes he
[3:17:19] [Music]
[3:17:26] speaks you just sett with the faith of
[3:17:29] the
[3:17:30] word that's enough for
[3:17:33] you that's very establishing brother
[3:17:38] team you know when we come back to the
[3:17:41] real word
[3:17:43] it plugs out those
[3:17:46] things and we must come back to the
[3:17:49] original condition to the original seat
[3:17:54] which was sown on the of P that's what
[3:17:58] God is coming back
[3:18:01] for Amen brother Moses where are you
[3:18:07] amen for living
[3:18:09] creatures praise God amen amen let me
[3:18:13] tell you the holy spirit in every
[3:18:17] age you know had to manifest in certain
[3:18:21] way depending on the need of that
[3:18:25] time and let me tell you also that in
[3:18:28] our local churches when the Holy Spirit
[3:18:32] Works he also works depending to the
[3:18:36] needs of that local
[3:18:41] church
[3:18:42] am God bless you do you appreciate our
[3:18:48] brother amen am you see when the Holy
[3:18:52] Spirit
