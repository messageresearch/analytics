[17:53] of his saving
[17:55] grace. All the sweets of
[17:59] glory. Let me lift my voice
[18:04] scales. Oh, at last ever to
[18:10] rejoice when in service. Oh my God. Dark
[18:15] may be the
[18:17] night, but I'll cling more close to him.
[18:22] He will give me
[18:24] life. Satan snares may veg my soul. Turn
[18:29] my thoughts
[18:32] aside, but my Lord goes
[18:35] ahead. It's whatever
[18:39] be. Oh, I want to
[18:42] see and look on his
[18:46] face there and to sing forever.
[18:51] Oh my saving
[18:53] grace on the streets of glory.
[18:58] Let me leave my
[19:02] voice and home at last ever till when we
[19:07] in the valley when it far is
[19:12] low towards the mountain
[19:15] high and behold my
[19:19] savior leading in the
[19:23] fire with a hand or stretch to The
[19:28] [Music]
[19:30] valley guiding me. I can see as I
[19:37] own. Oh, I want to see him
[19:43] and may I sing
[19:45] [Music]
[19:47] forever. Oh my saving grace.
[19:53] All that sweets of
[19:55] glory let me lift my
[19:59] voice all passing all my glass ever to
[20:06] rejoice when before me be rise from the
[20:12] mighty deep.
[20:14] Then my Lord directs my path. He does
[20:21] me and he leads me gently on through
[20:26] this
[20:28] valley. He's a real friend to me.
[20:34] Oh hallelujah.
[20:36] Oh, I want to
[20:38] see and
[20:41] know they sing
[20:44] forever,

[23:59] [Music]
[24:19] I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus
[24:22] Christ and we thank God for the
[24:24] opportunity to come back here
[24:28] today. Let us ourselves and
[24:31] pray. Father in the name of our Lord
[24:33] Jesus
[24:34] Christ, we thank you Lord for this
[24:38] evening for your love, grace and mercy.
[24:42] that you've never us to come into your
[24:45] presence and we've come with different
[24:49] situations. But Lord, you know how to
[24:52] help every one of
[24:54] us. We pray may bless us dear
[24:58] Lord. Make yourself known unto
[25:01] us and deliver us from all captivity of
[25:06] Satan that indeed we be able to serve
[25:08] you and worship you.
[25:13] free. Remember sister
[25:17] Lord Lord commit her into your
[25:20] hands. We pray that you may completely
[25:22] touch her
[25:24] father in the name of
[25:26] Jesus. We also pray for brother
[25:31] George in such
[25:35] special
[25:37] heavenly also remember others in
[25:39] different
[25:41] places different
[25:44] situations that your grace may come to
[25:46] help them
[25:48] out and bless us
[25:50] all. May you speak to our hearts,
[25:52] heavenly
[25:54] father such as sick and weaken
[25:58] our fill us with your
[26:00] spirit in the name of the Lord
[26:04] Jesus. Amen.
[26:06] Amen. Let us go to John chapter
[26:12] 14. We're reading from we're reading
[26:15] verse 26 only.
[26:23] So the Bible says, "But the comforter,
[26:26] which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
[26:29] will send in my name, he shall teach you
[26:32] all things and bring all things to your
[26:35] remeance, whatsoever I have said unto
[26:37] you.
[26:52] of his
[26:55] word. So I want to continue with our
[26:57] subject on the Holy
[27:01] Ghost. Today we want focus on the Holy
[27:04] Ghost as the inside
[27:09] teacher. Our subject is the inside
[27:12] teacher.
[27:16] I want to get right into
[27:19] this age bookage
[27:26] 143
[27:36] 143. Now when God is
[27:40] silent, we had better be
[27:44] silent. But where he has
[27:47] spoken, we had better speak
[27:50] to and say what he has already said.
[27:56] He told us the
[27:58] evidence or what would happen after
[28:01] being baptized with the Holy
[28:05] Ghost was that we would have the teacher
[28:09] come and teach us all
[28:14] truth. But that
[28:17] teacher was an inside
[28:22] teacher, not an outside teacher.
[28:27] If the spirit wasn't
[28:30] inside, you wouldn't hear the
[28:36] truth and receive it by
[28:40] revelation. If you had it every moment
[28:44] of the
[28:47] day, that was the sign of the indwelling
[28:54] spirit in the days of
[28:56] Paul. Those who were filled with the
[29:00] Holy
[29:03] Ghost had the
[29:06] word received
[29:08] it and lived by
[29:11] it.
[29:13] Those who did not have the
[29:16] spirit had it only as can
[29:22] men put a wrong interpretation on it and
[29:26] went into
[29:31] sin in every
[29:34] age and every age is the age of the Holy
[29:37] Ghost for the true believer.
[29:43] I say in every
[29:45] age the evidence was the same.
[29:50] Those who had the
[29:53] spirit, the
[29:55] teacher, they had the
[29:58] word. And that spirit in them took the
[30:03] word and taught
[30:06] it or revealed
[30:08] it to
[30:10] them. And they were of the group that
[30:13] had the messenger.
[30:20] and his
[30:21] message and took
[30:23] it and lived
[30:26] it. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[30:29] that's what brother Brham is telling us
[30:31] in the seven church
[30:35] ages. I believe in the course of the
[30:37] study we shall take some service on the
[30:39] evidence of the Holy
[30:43] Spirit. But then here is telling us
[30:47] The proof that somebody has the spirit
[30:49] of
[30:51] God is to receive the message of your
[30:56] day and then you live the life of that
[31:01] message like when you read in in
[31:04] Revelations chapter
[31:06] 2, you know, every end of the church
[31:10] church message
[31:19] He would say, "He that has an
[31:21] ear, let him hear what the spirit says
[31:25] to the
[31:27] churches." So then it has to be the Holy
[31:29] Spirit within
[31:32] us that gives us the
[31:35] ability to hear what the message is for
[31:38] our day.
[31:42] So now brother Brham
[31:44] says that those being baptized with the
[31:46] Holy
[31:48] Ghost, they would have the teacher
[31:53] come and that teacher is the Holy Spirit
[31:57] himself who comes as an inside
[32:02] teacher. So then he gives you the
[32:05] ability to receive the word of God.
[32:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Even
[32:12] sometimes when you are doing a
[32:15] mistake, when you have the spirit of God
[32:17] in
[32:19] you and then you are
[32:22] corrected, you receive that correction
[32:25] in good
[32:30] faith. You know, you don't take it that
[32:32] you know they are criticizing
[32:34] me against
[32:37] me. Like many times, brother would talk
[32:40] to the Pentecostal
[32:44] people and says, "If you really have the
[32:46] spirit of
[32:48] God, you will know that as a woman to
[32:51] cut off your hair is
[32:55] wrong." Because that's what the spirit
[32:58] says. If you really have the spirit of
[33:01] God, you would know as a woman, it's
[33:03] wrong for you to be a preacher.
[33:09] or if you have the spirit of God, you
[33:12] know that to live like the world is
[33:15] wrong because the Holy Spirit in our
[33:19] lives will not like those
[33:23] things. The spirit is grieved by the
[33:25] things contrary to the word of
[33:31] God. Praise the name of our Lord.
[33:34] telling them you can if you hear the
[33:37] word and then you obey the word then
[33:41] they will know that maybe you have the
[33:42] spirit of
[33:43] God but if you hear the word and dislike
[33:47] the word and you reject the word that
[33:52] shows there's no spirit of God in
[33:55] you so that's what he's telling us
[33:58] here that the proof that one has the
[34:01] spirit of
[34:03] God is for you to receive the word of
[34:07] God. The message of the
[34:10] day and then you live the life of that
[34:16] message. Praise the name of our Lord.
[34:18] And you see that would prove that the
[34:20] spirit of God dwells in
[34:24] us. Praise the name of our Lord. Now let
[34:27] us go back to John 14:26.
[34:32] So the Bible says, "But the comforter,
[34:35] which is the Holy
[34:37] Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
[34:42] name, he will teach you all
[34:47] things and bring all things to your
[34:51] remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
[34:54] you."
[34:57] So now the Holy Spirit
[35:00] teaches us all
[35:03] things. In other words, he comes and
[35:06] reveals to
[35:08] us the message of the hour that God has
[35:12] given to
[35:14] us because it is the spirit that uses
[35:16] the
[35:18] messenger. And when the messenger comes
[35:21] with the
[35:22] message, then the Holy Spirit in
[35:25] you will lead you to the message the
[35:28] messenger has given unto
[35:31] us. Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[35:33] know if you look at the church
[35:36] ages, each age had its
[35:40] portion and that was the word that was
[35:43] quickened in that time.
[35:48] Praise the name of our Lord. But now we
[35:50] are living at the end
[35:52] time. So all the fullness of the
[35:56] word has already been given to
[35:59] us. Praise the name of our Lord. We have
[36:03] more than what other ages
[36:07] had. The fullness of God has come
[36:12] down. And it is a time where Christ
[36:16] is uniting with the
[36:19] body. Praise the name of our Lord. Come
[36:22] and take us into the
[36:25] rapture. So we need to be
[36:28] certain that we have the spirit of God
[36:31] living within
[36:33] us. Praise the name of our Lord. Spirit
[36:37] being real in our
[36:39] lives, taking over our decision making.
[36:45] Praise the name of our Lord. That's one
[36:47] thing we should always be
[36:50] certain. Praise the name of our
[36:53] Lord. Now in the message here
[36:57] him says remember the Holy
[37:01] Spirit will
[37:03] [Music]
[37:04] tutor the children by the direction of
[37:08] the book of the father.
[37:16] That is the
[37:17] word. God will raise his church by the
[37:24] word and the Holy Spirit will teach the
[37:28] church the
[37:31] word
[37:34] notism.
[37:38] Soism, not the rules of the
[37:45] church, but the power of the
[37:49] word of the living
[37:52] God. The Holy
[37:54] Spirit will give that to the
[37:59] church. Did not our blessed Lord say,
[38:06] Man shall not live by bread
[38:13] alone, but by every word that proceeds
[38:16] out of the mouth of
[38:19] God. That is the thing the Holy Spirit
[38:23] will
[38:25] teach. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[38:28] the Holy
[38:29] Spirit all the time will teach us the
[38:33] word of
[38:35] God. Praise the name of our Lord and the
[38:38] Holy Spirit is the one who speaks to us
[38:41] the word of
[38:43] God. And when we obey the word of
[38:47] God, he gives us the
[38:50] ability to live the life of that very
[38:54] word. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[38:57] now for us
[38:59] to be taught of the spirit,
[39:03] we must have a yearning for the word of
[39:08] God. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[39:10] know, the Bible says, "I shall not live
[39:13] by bread
[39:15] alone, but by every word that proceeds
[39:18] out of the mouth of
[39:21] God." So you must have a desire in your
[39:25] heart. Lord, I need to hear more of your
[39:29] word. And the more you desire the word
[39:33] of
[39:34] God, the more the Holy Spirit brings the
[39:37] word of
[39:39] God like here in Matthew chapter
[39:43] 5. Let us go and pick up that
[39:46] scripture. Praise the name of our Lord.
[39:50] Matthew chapter 5.
[39:53] And then we read
[39:55] in let us speak verse six
[40:00] he says blessed are they that hunger and
[40:02] thirst after righteousness for they
[40:04] shall be
[40:14] filled. So he says you are blessed if
[40:16] you hunger and thirst after
[40:18] righteousness.
[40:23] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[40:25] have a desire to know more of
[40:29] God, he says you shall be
[40:33] filled. In other words, you are going to
[40:35] be
[40:37] fed. You are going to be given that you
[40:40] are desiring
[40:41] for. And so the Holy
[40:44] Spirit creates a yearning in our
[40:48] heart that we desire to hear more of
[40:53] God. We desire to know more of
[40:58] God. There's a scenario in the book of
[41:00] Acts chapter
[41:04] 13. Acts chapter
[41:07] 13 and then verse
[41:10] 44. The Bible
[41:12] says, "And the next Sabbath, the next
[41:15] Sabbath day, came almost the whole city
[41:18] together to hear the word of God.
[41:30] But when the Jews saw the multitudes,
[41:33] they were filled with envy and spoke
[41:35] against those things which were spoken
[41:38] by Paul, contradicting and blaming.
[41:43] [Music]
[41:54] Then Paul and Barabas waxed bold and
[41:57] said, "It was necessary that the word of
[42:00] God should first have been spoken to
[42:02] you. But seeing you put it from you and
[42:07] judge yourselves and worthy of
[42:10] everlasting life, law, we turn to the
[42:13] Gentiles.
[42:31] For so has the Lord commanded us,
[42:33] saying, I have set thee to be a light of
[42:36] the Gentiles, that thou should be for
[42:38] salvation unto the ends of the earth.
[42:55] And when the Gentiles heard this, they
[42:58] were glad and glorified the word of the
[43:01] Lord. And as many as were ordained to
[43:04] eternal life believed.
[43:18] And the word of the Lord was published
[43:21] throughout all the
[43:26] region. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[43:29] you see they went to this
[43:32] city. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[43:35] then they started preaching.
[43:39] But then the
[43:41] Jews, you know, that was in Antioch,
[43:45] they opposed the things Paul was
[43:49] preaching. And then Paul says, "Now you
[43:52] Jews, you've counted yourself and worth
[43:53] of eternal
[43:57] life." So we are turning to the
[44:01] Gentiles because this is what the Lord
[44:03] has told
[44:05] us that we take the gospel to the
[44:07] Gentiles.
[44:10] Now when the Gentiles heard
[44:13] this, the Bible says they were
[44:17] glad and then the Bible says they
[44:21] glorified the word of
[44:24] God and as many of them were ordained to
[44:28] eternal
[44:30] life, they believed the word. In other
[44:33] words, there was a fasting in them which
[44:35] was created.
[44:40] until they would desire to hear more of
[44:42] the word of
[44:46] God. So the Holy Spirit became an inside
[44:50] teacher in
[44:53] them and the more they desire to hear
[44:55] the word of
[44:58] God, the more they were taught by the
[45:00] Holy
[45:02] Spirit. And when they are taught by the
[45:04] Holy
[45:05] Spirit, then the Holy Spirit would give
[45:09] them the
[45:11] ability to leave their
[45:15] idols, to leave their
[45:18] sins and turn unto
[45:20] God. And it should also be the same
[45:23] thing with
[45:24] us. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[45:27] know, there was a place also in the
[45:29] scriptures here
[45:33] Praise the name of our Lord. It talks
[45:35] about the people of Belair.
[45:39] And the Bible says they did
[45:44] well. They searched the
[45:48] scriptures to see if these things be
[45:53] so. They desire to know more of
[45:57] God. Praise the name of our Lord. In
[46:00] Acts chapter
[46:02] 17 and then verse 10,
[46:06] and the brethren immediately sent away
[46:09] Paul and Silas by night una who coming
[46:12] thither went into the synagogue of the
[46:15] Jews.
[46:31] These were more noble than those in
[46:34] Thessalonica in that they received the
[46:36] word with all readiness of mind and
[46:39] search the scriptures daily whether
[46:41] those things were so.
[47:01] Therefore, many of them believed also of
[47:03] honorable women, which were Greeks, and
[47:06] of men, not a few.
[47:19] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[47:21] says they searched the word
[47:25] daily. They went back
[47:27] home and they picked their
[47:30] Bibles all their scrolls and started
[47:34] studying these
[47:35] things. And these things so that should
[47:39] also be the same thing with us. Praise
[47:42] the name of our Lord because the Bible
[47:44] says, "Blessed are they that
[47:48] read and hear and do the things written
[47:52] in the
[47:54] prophecy." So there is a
[47:57] blessing, you get further into the
[48:00] spirit of
[48:02] God. Like now when Christ revealed
[48:05] himself to Saul when he was still
[48:10] soul, he took three days praying and
[48:15] fasting. When Anas came and prayed for
[48:19] him, he went to Arabia for 3
[48:26] years and then he started reading this
[48:29] Old
[48:31] Testament before he met
[48:34] Christ. He couldn't have an
[48:36] understanding of the
[48:38] things. He was following the knowledge
[48:40] of theological schools and
[48:44] seminaries. And that is also the same
[48:46] thing in those
[48:50] denominations. They can tell you the
[48:53] scripture, but they don't know how to
[48:55] apply that
[48:58] scripture like maybe you in scripture
[49:03] quiz. What is the shortest verse in the
[49:06] Bible?
[49:08] Bible Jesus wept.
[49:10] John chapter is it 11 or 12 or 13? This
[49:13] and this. Mhm. What is the longest verse
[49:17] in the Bible?
[49:20] And then you are able to quote
[49:22] that. Which book in the Bible has many
[49:27] chapters?
[49:30] Psalms. Which chapter is the longest in
[49:32] the
[49:34] Bible? Psalms 119.
[49:38] You can be able to pick up those
[49:42] things, but they don't give you
[49:46] life because you have not been taught of
[49:48] the
[49:50] spirit. When the spirit teaches
[49:53] you, it gives you understanding of the
[49:58] scriptures. Praise the name of our Lord.
[50:00] You know, they came and asking Jesus
[50:02] Christ.
[50:04] There were some Pharisees and
[50:08] Sadducees. They came and tempted him and
[50:12] then they told him there was a man who
[50:14] married a
[50:17] wife. Unfortunately, he
[50:20] died because in the Old Testament there
[50:22] was wife
[50:25] inheritance. And so when the first son,
[50:28] the first husband died, the brother took
[50:30] over. Even the second, the third up to
[50:32] the
[50:37] seventh until the seventh took the same
[50:42] wife. Then they were asking Jesus
[50:44] Christ in the
[50:47] resurrection. Whose wife is it going to
[50:51] be
[50:54] understanding? There's a religion which
[50:56] says when you go to heaven, you have
[50:57] four women.
[51:02] Marriages of
[51:05] earth. Praise the name of So gets
[51:09] consolation. I've been disappointed here
[51:10] in this marriage. Maybe they are have
[51:13] better.
[51:18] No. Jesus told them you don't understand
[51:22] the
[51:24] scriptures. Because they had no
[51:26] revelation of the word of God.
[51:30] And then Jesus started telling them
[51:32] about the
[51:34] scriptures and told them those who will
[51:37] be counted worthy of the next
[51:42] life. They will be like
[51:45] angels because angels don't
[51:48] marry and are not given in
[51:51] marriage. And then you find some
[51:54] people taking this doctrine
[52:00] of you know that demons catch women and
[52:04] we rape
[52:06] women and then somebody says there's a
[52:08] female demon and a male
[52:13] demon. That's not
[52:15] scripture. But somebody can believe
[52:20] that like I think about 15 years or 20
[52:24] years
[52:28] in they were saying that you know they
[52:31] were catching
[52:34] women. But until they found it was men
[52:37] not
[52:40] demons. But people can have those kind
[52:42] of spirits
[52:46] like some of these novels of Emanuel and
[52:50] others and then somebody believes those
[52:53] kind of
[52:55] things. Ah they can turn into
[52:58] this. They can turn into this and
[53:02] disappear. Why don't they disappear when
[53:04] death has
[53:07] come? Praise the name of our Lord. But
[53:10] people have different kind of funny
[53:14] understanding. So Jesus was telling
[53:17] them, you don't know the
[53:20] scriptures and you don't understand the
[53:23] power of
[53:25] God. And that's what is in the
[53:28] denomination. They can read for you the
[53:31] scripture, but they lack the revelation
[53:34] of the
[53:36] scriptures. When they go to the water
[53:38] baptism,
[53:42] They say me, I'm doing the way the Lord
[53:44] Jesus Christ said
[53:46] do. Jesus said, "Baptize in the name of
[53:48] the father, the son, and the holy
[53:51] ghost." And then they go with
[53:53] that. The book is still sealed to
[53:58] them. The seals are not broken before
[54:01] them. They don't know the scriptures and
[54:05] they don't understand the power of God.
[54:08] So now when the Holy Spirit
[54:11] comes because the Bible says when he the
[54:15] spirit of truth is
[54:18] come he will guide us into all
[54:23] truth. In other words he reveals to us
[54:26] the word of
[54:28] God. Let us go to John
[54:34] 16:12. He says, "I have yet many things
[54:37] to say unto you, but you cannot bear
[54:40] them
[54:41] now." John
[54:54] 16:12. Spirit of truth is come. He will
[54:57] guide you into all truth. For he shall
[55:00] not speak of himself, but whatever he
[55:03] shall hear, that shall he speak, and
[55:05] will show you things to come.
[55:26] Praise the name of the Lord. So we need
[55:28] the spirit of
[55:30] God to have a clear understanding of the
[55:34] word of
[55:37] God. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[55:40] need that
[55:41] spirit to come and teach us
[55:45] that we can be able to know the things
[55:48] of
[55:49] God. And that's what the Bible says in 1
[55:52] Corinthians chapter
[55:56] 2. Praise the name of our
[55:59] Lord. 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and then
[56:02] verse
[56:07] 12 it says
[56:11] Now we have received not the spirit of
[56:13] the world, but the spirit which is of
[56:15] God, that we might know the things that
[56:18] are freely given to us of God.
[56:29] So now the Holy
[56:31] Spirit shows us the things that God has
[56:34] given to
[56:36] us, reveals them to
[56:38] us, manifest them to us.
[56:42] Then he says, "Which things we also
[56:45] speak
[56:47] not in what with man's wisdom teaches,
[56:49] but the Holy Spirit teaches comparing
[56:53] spiritual things with spiritual.
[57:10] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[57:12] spiritual
[57:13] things are told to us by the Holy
[57:18] Spirit. It helps
[57:20] us to do the will of
[57:24] God. Praise the name of our Lord. Even
[57:27] if you had a spiritual
[57:30] dream, bring it under the word.
[57:34] The dream I'm
[57:36] having, does it match with the word of
[57:39] God? The vision that I
[57:42] have, does it match with the word of
[57:45] God? The decision that I'm
[57:48] making, does it match with the word of
[57:51] God? The desires that I have, does it
[57:55] match with the word of God?
[57:58] back to the
[58:00] word and then you check using the
[58:04] word because the Holy Spirit teaches us
[58:08] the word of
[58:09] God. The Holy Spirit will not teach us
[58:12] away from the word of
[58:14] God because he is meant to guide
[58:18] us into all
[58:21] truth. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[58:24] need to have the Holy Spirit in our
[58:25] lives.
[58:27] as an inside
[58:29] teacher and when you have the spirit of
[58:33] God that is your
[58:35] protection. Praise the name of our Lord.
[58:38] When a false teacher
[58:40] comes or something which doesn't match
[58:43] with the
[58:44] word, the spirit will tell you
[58:48] inside this thing is not
[58:51] right. Or you may even not know exactly
[58:54] what the word of God says.
[58:57] But somehow the spirit of
[58:59] God will be
[59:02] sensitive and will hold you to
[59:06] be. What is this thing
[59:08] here? Praise the name of our Lord
[59:11] because he's an inside
[59:13] teacher. He's given to us to be
[59:18] guided to lead us to show us things to
[59:23] come. Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[59:26] need to see that the spirit of
[59:29] God dwells within
[59:32] us. Then we continue in 1 Corinthians
[59:35] chapter 12 chapter 2 and then verse
[59:38] 15. That's verse 14. But the natural man
[59:42] receives not the things of the spirit of
[59:44] God. For they are foolishness unto him.
[59:47] Neither can he know them because they
[59:50] are spiritually discerned.
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:08] But he that is spiritual judges all
[1:00:12] things. Yet he himself is judged of no
[1:00:16] man.
[1:00:24] For who has known the mind of the Lord
[1:00:27] that he has instructed him? We have the
[1:00:31] mind of Christ.
[1:00:43] Amen. Amen. So he says we have the mind
[1:00:46] of God.
[1:00:49] How do we have the mind of God? By
[1:00:52] having the spirit of God living in
[1:00:55] us. Because the spirit of
[1:00:57] God, the Bible says searches all
[1:01:03] things, even the deep things of
[1:01:07] God. He knows the will of God.
[1:01:11] So the Holy
[1:01:12] Spirit will always reveal to you the
[1:01:15] will of
[1:01:18] God. You know what is the will of God
[1:01:20] concerning what I'm going
[1:01:23] through? What is the will of God
[1:01:26] concerning the decisions I'm going to
[1:01:29] make? So the spirit of God takes charge
[1:01:34] over your
[1:01:35] life or even in your daily affairs.
[1:01:41] every
[1:01:42] day, your
[1:01:45] footsteps, the people you associate
[1:01:47] with, where you spend most of your
[1:01:50] time, the spirit of God takes interest
[1:01:53] in all those small
[1:01:57] details. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[1:02:00] cares in every
[1:02:02] situation. What decision am I
[1:02:06] making? What thoughts am I having?
[1:02:09] Where am I spending most of my
[1:02:11] time? Praise the name of our Lord. So,
[1:02:14] we need to allow the spirit of
[1:02:17] God to take charge over our
[1:02:20] lives. Praise the name of our
[1:02:24] Lord. Let us go and read in John 1 John
[1:02:27] chapter 2:4.
[1:02:32] The Bible says, "Let that let that
[1:02:36] therefore abide in you, which you have
[1:02:38] heard from the beginning, if that which
[1:02:41] you have heard from the beginning shall
[1:02:43] remain in you, ye also shall continue in
[1:02:48] the Son and in the Father." 1 John 2:4.
[1:03:18] Praise the name of our Lord. He says
[1:03:21] that which you've heard from the
[1:03:25] beginning and if you continue
[1:03:29] in you should be in the
[1:03:32] son and in the
[1:03:35] father and this is the promise that he
[1:03:38] has promised us even eternal life.
[1:03:49] These things have I written unto you
[1:03:52] concerning them that seduce
[1:03:59] you. But the anointing which you have
[1:04:02] received of him abideth in you, and you
[1:04:07] need not that any man teach you, but as
[1:04:10] the same anointing teaches you all
[1:04:14] things. and is truth and is no lie. Even
[1:04:18] as I have taught you, you shall abide in
[1:04:23] him.
[1:04:53] [Music]
[1:05:00] Praise the name of our Lord. says that
[1:05:02] as he has taught
[1:05:04] us how the Holy Spirit keeps on teaching
[1:05:08] us, he says we need to abide in what we
[1:05:11] are
[1:05:14] taught. And how do you abide in the
[1:05:17] word by doing the word what the word
[1:05:20] tells you to
[1:05:22] do? Praise the name of our Lord. That's
[1:05:25] how you abide in
[1:05:27] it. Like the scripture we're sharing, I
[1:05:29] believe it was in the morning.
[1:05:33] in John chapter
[1:05:37] 8 and then verse 30.
[1:05:42] As he spoke these words, many believed
[1:05:45] on
[1:05:46] him. John chapter 8 verse 30.
[1:05:57] Then he
[1:05:59] says to those Jews which believed on
[1:06:01] him,
[1:06:03] if you continue in my word, then you are
[1:06:07] my disciples
[1:06:18] indeed. And you shall know the truth,
[1:06:21] and the truth shall make you free.
[1:06:27] Praise the name of our Lord. You have
[1:06:31] believed. Continue in the
[1:06:35] word. And when you continue in the word,
[1:06:39] it changes
[1:06:40] you. You know
[1:06:43] him in the power of his resurrection.
[1:06:48] So your life is
[1:06:50] transformed and then you are set free
[1:06:53] from any form of
[1:06:56] bondage. Now the
[1:06:58] devil in the beginning was in the
[1:07:03] truth but he never abode in the
[1:07:07] truth. John 8:44.
[1:07:12] You are of your father the devil and the
[1:07:15] lust of your father you will do. He was
[1:07:17] a murderer from the beginning and abode
[1:07:20] not in the truth. When he speaks a lie,
[1:07:23] he speaks of his own. For he is a liar
[1:07:25] and the father of
[1:07:28] it. Verse 44.
[1:07:58] Now that's the devil. He had the
[1:08:02] truth, but he left the
[1:08:06] truth. He didn't dwell in the
[1:08:09] truth. He didn't get transformed by the
[1:08:14] truth. And now this is where the spirit
[1:08:17] comes
[1:08:18] in that we may continue with all the
[1:08:23] truth. The spirit keeps on teaching
[1:08:26] us, guiding us, directing us. Praise the
[1:08:31] name of our Lord and the time you leave
[1:08:34] the leadership of the Holy
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:38] Spirit, then you are on your
[1:08:41] own. Praise the name of our Lord. But we
[1:08:44] need to allow the spirit of
[1:08:46] God to take charge in our
[1:08:49] lives every day. Being led of the Holy
[1:08:53] Spirit, being taught of the Holy
[1:08:55] Spirit, taking your
[1:08:58] time, reading your
[1:09:00] Bible, reading your message
[1:09:03] book. Brother Brandham says, "The Holy
[1:09:06] Spirit feeds on the word of God."
[1:09:10] So you need to see that you are feeding
[1:09:12] on the
[1:09:14] word and then the spirit keeps on
[1:09:16] revealing to those things you
[1:09:19] read and you know as you read
[1:09:22] them you find that there is a time of
[1:09:29] need. You'll need the word that you have
[1:09:32] read.
[1:09:34] Praise the name of our Lord. You'll need
[1:09:36] it at a particular instance.
[1:09:41] you know, which can come at any
[1:09:44] time. Maybe the devil has planned
[1:09:48] something, but then the Holy Ghost gives
[1:09:50] you a warning ahead of
[1:09:55] time, you know, whereby you get in
[1:09:58] desperation for
[1:10:00] something, you pray over
[1:10:02] it. You know there's some danger that is
[1:10:07] coming. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:10:10] we need to see that we allow the Holy
[1:10:13] Spirit to take charge over our lives at
[1:10:17] our places of work at our
[1:10:21] homes in our communities where we live
[1:10:24] and wherever we
[1:10:26] are. We allow the spirit of God to lead
[1:10:29] us in everything.
[1:10:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:10:35] message here it
[1:10:38] says and when the Holy Spirit teaches
[1:10:40] unadulterated holiness before the
[1:10:43] Lord. When the Holy Spirit teaches
[1:10:47] unadulterated
[1:10:53] holiness, how do you think the Holy
[1:10:58] Spirit
[1:11:00] feels to bring the word before the
[1:11:02] father that we are
[1:11:07] selfish? We are not
[1:11:10] concerned. We stay home on prayer
[1:11:13] meeting
[1:11:14] nights. We stay
[1:11:17] home in prayer meeting
[1:11:22] nights. We watch old religious
[1:11:27] programs and censored with dirty jokes
[1:11:30] and
[1:11:33] everything and then calling
[1:11:36] ourselves the church of the living God.
[1:11:40] What do you think he thinks
[1:11:44] tonight? Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:11:47] it depends on what is inside of
[1:11:52] you. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:11:55] know like we in service and somebody
[1:11:59] feels comfort to attend a certain
[1:12:03] program. Then how will the Holy Spirit
[1:12:06] teach
[1:12:07] you? Praise the name of our Lord. You
[1:12:10] are staying away from
[1:12:14] class, you know. So, how are you going
[1:12:16] to pass the exams or the trials that are
[1:12:20] coming? Because the trials keep on
[1:12:23] coming. And you know, sometimes some
[1:12:25] things just happen and you don't know
[1:12:26] how it has started.
[1:12:31] If the Holy Spirit has been building in
[1:12:36] you, you'll be able to face those
[1:12:41] challenges and be able to overcome every
[1:12:43] one of
[1:12:45] them. Praise the name of our Lord
[1:12:47] because the spirit of God has taken time
[1:12:51] preparing you for that
[1:12:55] hour. Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[1:12:58] need to see that we take time
[1:13:01] Wait on the Lord. Read our message
[1:13:05] books. Read the word of
[1:13:08] God. And as you receive
[1:13:11] it, take time and meditate upon the
[1:13:15] word. Take time and testify about the
[1:13:18] word you've
[1:13:20] heard. Talk to your
[1:13:22] colleagues. Talk to your
[1:13:24] neighbors. Talk to your family members.
[1:13:27] Tell them about the goodness of
[1:13:30] God. Tell them what the Lord has done in
[1:13:33] your
[1:13:34] life. And then you say the Lord will
[1:13:36] also work out in their
[1:13:39] lives and bring transformation to
[1:13:43] them. Praise the name of our Lord. Now,
[1:13:46] in the message, the mark of the
[1:13:50] beast, notice, except a man be born
[1:13:54] again, he can no wise enter into the
[1:13:58] kingdom. That's right. You must
[1:14:02] come, no matter how religious you
[1:14:05] are, what you all
[1:14:08] do, that has nothing to
[1:14:11] do that makes you pretty good citizen.
[1:14:17] but not a citizen of the
[1:14:20] kingdom. Maybe of this kingdom
[1:14:23] here. But the kingdom of
[1:14:26] God is within you. You are born in the
[1:14:31] kingdom. The kingdom of God is the Holy
[1:14:37] Spirit. You belong to that kingdom.
[1:14:42] That's the reason women don't bo their
[1:14:47] hair. They don't wear
[1:14:53] shorts. That's the reason men don't
[1:14:56] smoke cigarettes and things like
[1:15:00] that. They are from
[1:15:04] above. Their
[1:15:07] spirit teaches them righteousness.
[1:15:13] holiness. They don't
[1:15:16] swear. They don't use bad
[1:15:20] language and things like that. They are
[1:15:23] born from
[1:15:24] above. They are
[1:15:26] different. They are from the citizens
[1:15:31] above. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[1:15:34] need to have the inside teacher in
[1:15:36] us. That is the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:40] guiding us in every
[1:15:42] step. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:15:45] you know as you accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:15:47] as your personal
[1:15:50] savior, allow him to be your Lord and
[1:15:55] Savior. It takes
[1:15:59] lulership. You know your
[1:16:01] mind, your heart, your
[1:16:05] desire, you whatever you go,
[1:16:09] praise the name of our Lord. Fully
[1:16:11] surrender to the Lord Jesus
[1:16:13] Christ. And then you see how the Holy
[1:16:16] Spirit will keep on leading
[1:16:18] you, you directing
[1:16:21] you and bringing you to higher levels
[1:16:24] than you have ever been to.
[1:16:28] Praise the name of our Lord. We just
[1:16:30] need to learn how to surrender to the
[1:16:32] Holy
[1:16:33] Spirit and say, "Lord, lead me. Lord,
[1:16:37] guide me. Lord, direct
[1:16:40] me." Praise the name of the Lord. And
[1:16:43] you know to live a life that the Holy
[1:16:45] Ghost is comfortable with
[1:16:48] you. You know the Bible says, "Grieve
[1:16:52] not the Holy Spirit of
[1:16:54] God, whereby you are sealed unto the day
[1:16:57] of your
[1:17:01] redemption in Ephesians
[1:17:07] 4:30." And then in verse 31,
[1:17:10] let all
[1:17:12] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[1:17:16] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[1:17:20] from you with all malice.
[1:17:34] Praise the name of the Lord because
[1:17:36] these are the things that grieve the
[1:17:38] Holy
[1:17:40] Spirit. In other words, they make the
[1:17:44] Holy Spirit timid or shy
[1:17:49] away. So the Holy Spirit becomes
[1:17:53] silent. Brother Brham says he goes away.
[1:17:59] and waits for you to make amends with
[1:18:03] God. So you find you're doing things by
[1:18:09] yourself, you know, like when people
[1:18:11] start abusing one
[1:18:14] another and then you like those dirty
[1:18:16] jokes and things like
[1:18:19] that, you can't say you can pray at that
[1:18:22] time.
[1:18:24] Now you find everything is just
[1:18:29] hard because there's some spirit you've
[1:18:32] eaten
[1:18:34] on. The Holy Spirit has been
[1:18:37] grieved and yet the Bible says that the
[1:18:40] Holy Spirit helps our
[1:18:44] infirmities such as our
[1:18:46] hearts. But now you have grieved the
[1:18:49] Holy
[1:18:50] Spirit. You are now with a wrong
[1:18:55] company. So you find even the joy of
[1:18:58] your salvation is taken
[1:19:05] away. Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[1:19:08] should not grieve the Holy
[1:19:11] Spirit. Get away all
[1:19:14] bitterness. Get away all
[1:19:17] wrath. Get away all anger.
[1:19:22] and then
[1:19:25] clamor. And then he says, "And be kind
[1:19:29] one to
[1:19:33] another,
[1:19:35] tenderhearted, forgiving one
[1:19:38] another, even as God for Christ's sake
[1:19:41] has forgiven you."
[1:19:49] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:19:52] to Luke 12 and verse
[1:19:56] 11. The Bible
[1:19:59] says, "And when they bring you unto the
[1:20:01] synagogues, and unto magistrates and
[1:20:04] powers, take ye no thought how or what
[1:20:08] thing you shall answer, or what you
[1:20:11] shall say. For the Holy Ghost shall
[1:20:14] teach you in the same hour what you
[1:20:17] ought to say.
[1:20:46] Praise the name of the Lord. Now he said
[1:20:48] when you are put before those
[1:20:52] councils or you are challenged where you
[1:20:55] are living or you are working
[1:20:59] allow the Holy
[1:21:01] Spirit to give you the right words to
[1:21:04] respond. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:21:07] Now, that does not only apply when you
[1:21:10] are being asked a question or
[1:21:17] challenged. That does not only apply.
[1:21:25] What happens is
[1:21:27] this. The Holy Spirit takes over your
[1:21:33] life. He rules your
[1:21:35] life. So in whatever challenge you face
[1:21:38] in
[1:21:41] life whether before
[1:21:45] cancels whether before maybe you know
[1:21:48] home or place of work or
[1:21:52] wherever or you are put in a situation
[1:21:55] you don't know what to
[1:21:58] do. The Bible is saying that same
[1:22:03] hour the Holy
[1:22:06] Spirit will show you what to
[1:22:09] do, will tell you what to
[1:22:13] do or will speak to you what to
[1:22:17] speak. If they ask you the
[1:22:19] question, the Holy Ghost will give you
[1:22:21] the
[1:22:22] answer. If you are
[1:22:25] tempted, the Holy Ghost will give you
[1:22:27] the ability to overcome that temptation.
[1:22:32] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[1:22:34] the Holy Ghost works in our lives.
[1:22:37] And you know like when you read in the
[1:22:40] brother Brandham testifying several
[1:22:45] times you know when that mad
[1:22:51] [Music]
[1:22:52] cow he didn't have the
[1:22:55] gun. He had crossed into the fence where
[1:22:57] the cow
[1:23:01] was. He wouldn't go back.
[1:23:05] We don't want to go forward. The car was
[1:23:08] coming right
[1:23:10] away. Then the Holy Spirit just came
[1:23:14] down and then made him
[1:23:17] come as if nothing is
[1:23:22] happening. Then he talked to the cow.
[1:23:25] I'm sorry I've come in your
[1:23:27] place, but I have this reason of going
[1:23:30] passing through here.
[1:23:33] Please come down and sit
[1:23:37] there. That's the Holy
[1:23:39] Spirit coming at the time of
[1:23:43] need to make you do the right thing at
[1:23:46] that
[1:23:48] time. If it is a question, he will give
[1:23:51] you the right
[1:23:53] answer. If it is a challenge, he will
[1:23:56] make you do the right
[1:23:59] action. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:24:02] when the Holy Spirit told him that there
[1:24:03] is a trap set for
[1:24:07] you and then people came in the church
[1:24:09] and were doing things which are not
[1:24:11] appropriate a man and a
[1:24:17] woman. Then the spirit told him speak
[1:24:20] what you
[1:24:22] will and he looked at those people and
[1:24:26] he said I forgive them.
[1:24:29] That was the Holy Spirit coming
[1:24:32] down to make you do the right thing.
[1:24:37] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:24:39] how we should be able to bring the third
[1:24:41] pole into full
[1:24:45] operation. When we yield to the Holy
[1:24:50] Spirit in the challenge of stress, you
[1:24:53] know, in our
[1:24:55] lives and say Lord, I stop
[1:25:00] this. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:25:02] Because he says if you speak to this
[1:25:06] mountain be moved it shall be
[1:25:09] moved. And then the spirit was telling
[1:25:12] brother
[1:25:13] Brham that if a man's life is so
[1:25:21] consecrated you know
[1:25:23] until God can use
[1:25:26] him he'll be able to speak those things
[1:25:29] to existence.
[1:25:31] So it is no more you that
[1:25:34] liveth but it is Christ in
[1:25:37] you living his own life. Praise the name
[1:25:41] of our Lord. We need to grow to that
[1:25:45] stature. Until the Bible
[1:25:48] says the fruit of the
[1:25:52] spirit. But where does the spirit bear
[1:25:54] his
[1:25:56] fruit? In us. So you manifest the life
[1:26:00] of the Holy
[1:26:03] Spirit.
[1:26:04] Love, love of God. But where is the love
[1:26:08] of God
[1:26:10] expressed inside of you expressing it to
[1:26:15] others? The joy of the Lord is expressed
[1:26:19] in us.
[1:26:21] you. In other words, the Holy
[1:26:23] Spirit has taken over all your
[1:26:26] life until it is no longer you living
[1:26:29] but is Christ himself
[1:26:32] living. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:26:34] This is what we should always design our
[1:26:37] life. Christ live inside of
[1:26:40] me. Take over my life. Direct me. Guide
[1:26:46] me. Let me have the mind of God himself.
[1:26:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[1:26:52] allow the Holy
[1:26:54] Spirit to be our inside
[1:26:58] teacher. And you know we've read brother
[1:27:00] Brennham says the Holy Spirit is our
[1:27:09] tutor. The Holy Spirit is our
[1:27:13] tutor. And the
[1:27:15] tutor takes you through practical
[1:27:18] lessons.
[1:27:21] It's not
[1:27:24] theories theory theory according to
[1:27:30] this practical they take you into the
[1:27:34] field. Praise the name of our Lord. If
[1:27:37] you're learning how to
[1:27:41] drive, you're not good to you're not
[1:27:43] good enough when you're still driving in
[1:27:45] the field.
[1:27:52] Good learning is when you're driving on
[1:27:54] the road because that's where you're
[1:27:55] going to pract from.
[1:28:01] So the Holy Spirit also takes us in
[1:28:07] practicals real things, real life
[1:28:11] situation. What exactly
[1:28:15] happens? Maybe a bad neighbor rises up
[1:28:18] against
[1:28:21] you to prove what fruit is inside of
[1:28:24] you or a bad boss rises up against you.
[1:28:29] a bad subordinate rises up against
[1:28:33] you. Just to
[1:28:35] prove whether you have the spirit of
[1:28:38] God, praise the name of the Lord. So we
[1:28:41] need to allow the Holy
[1:28:43] Spirit to teach us. We need to yield the
[1:28:47] Holy
[1:28:48] Spirit that he continuously guides
[1:28:53] us. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:28:56] says he brings all these things to our
[1:29:02] remembrance, guiding us, teaching us,
[1:29:06] showing us things to come and bringing
[1:29:08] them to our
[1:29:10] remembrance. Praise the name of our
[1:29:12] Lord. How we need to have more of the
[1:29:14] Holy Spirit in our
[1:29:17] lives and that should always be our
[1:29:21] desire. Lord, fill me with your spirit.
[1:29:25] May the spirit of Christ live in every
[1:29:27] one of
[1:29:29] us. Amen. Amen. May God bless
[1:29:32] you.
[1:29:35] Amen. Let us stand up and sing that song
[1:29:44] 136. They were in the upper chamber.
[1:29:47] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:29:54] They were in an upper
[1:29:59] chamber. They were all with one accord.
[1:30:06] When the
[1:30:07] Holy Ghost
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:11] descended as was promised by our
[1:30:16] God,
[1:30:17] oh Lord, send
[1:30:21] upon. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, send the
[1:30:27] power just now.
[1:30:30] Oh Lord, send the power just now. You
[1:30:36] can
[1:30:37] go
[1:30:40] every send power now.
[1:30:44] Oh Lord, send the
[1:30:47] power. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, send the
[1:30:53] power just now.
[1:30:57] Oh Lord, send a power just now and
[1:31:04] baptize
[1:31:08] everyone. Yes, this power from heaven
[1:31:15] descended with a sound of
[1:31:19] rushing wind.
[1:31:22] GS of
[1:31:24] fire came down upon
[1:31:28] them. As the Lord say he will sing. Send
[1:31:34] the power now.
[1:31:37] Oh Lord
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:41] say hallelujah.
[1:31:43] Oh Lord send a power just now.
[1:31:51] Oh Lord send the power just now and
[1:31:58] baptize
[1:32:02] everyone. Yes. This all time power
[1:32:07] was
[1:32:09] there to our
[1:32:12] fathers who were true.
[1:32:17] is a
[1:32:18] proise
[1:32:22] you and we all may have
[1:32:27] it. Send the power
[1:32:32] now
[1:32:36] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:32:39] Oh Lord, send the power just now.
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:32:46] Oh Lord, send power just now and
[1:32:53] baptize
[1:32:55] everyone. Amen. Praise the name of our
[1:32:59] Lord. You know, it's the promise of
[1:33:01] God. Praise the name of our Lord. So,
[1:33:04] you shouldn't be scared or afraid. I
[1:33:08] don't know if I have it or what. Just
[1:33:11] have faith in the promise of God. Amen.
[1:33:14] Let us sing that Psalm 151. I'm so glad
[1:33:17] I'm one of them. Praise the name of our
[1:33:21] Lord. There are people almost everywhere
[1:33:27] whose hearts were all a flame with a
[1:33:32] fire that fell at
[1:33:35] Pentecost which cleansed and made them
[1:33:38] clean.
[1:33:40] It is burning now within my heart. Oh,
[1:33:46] glory to his
[1:33:48] name. I'm so glad that I can see I'm one
[1:33:54] of
[1:33:56] the Oh, one of the Oh,
[1:34:02] hallelujah. One of
[1:34:04] thee. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad that I
[1:34:10] can say I'm one
[1:34:15] of one
[1:34:24] of I'm so glad I can sing one
[1:34:33] of his People may not love
[1:34:38] me
[1:34:54] also
[1:34:56] find his power.
[1:35:00] Oh, I'm so glad that I can confess I'm
[1:35:05] one of the I'm one of
[1:35:09] the one of
[1:35:12] the hallelujah.
[1:35:18] Oh, I'm so glad I can see
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:29] what Hallelujah.
[1:35:36] of I'm so glad that I can see one of
[1:35:46] the
