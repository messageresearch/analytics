[3:33] us to come into your
[3:35] presence. You said where two or three
[3:37] are gathered in your
[3:39] name, they are in their midst.
[3:42] Lord we believe you in our midst. May
[3:45] you therefore speak to our hearts father
[3:48] that your purpose may be fulfilled in
[3:50] our
[3:50] lives our preeminence upon this
[3:54] service. We also pray for those who are
[3:57] traveling. Bring them to be part of the
[4:00] service and bless us all
[4:02] together. Love you Lord. We thank you
[4:06] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[4:09] this. Amen. Amen. I greet in the name of
[4:12] our Lord Jesus
[4:14] Christ. You are welcome for this
[4:18] service. Praise the name of our Lord.
[4:21] Brother M. You are
[4:23] welcome from
[4:28] Cami and he's helping
[4:31] us. Praise the name of the Lord. Let us
[4:34] go to 2 Corinthians chapter 1
[4:40] and then we're reading verse 20 to verse
[4:46] 22. The Bible
[4:50] says for all the promises of God in him
[4:53] are yeah and in him amen and to the
[4:56] glory of God by us.
[5:01] 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 20.
[5:21] [Music]
[5:23] Now he which establishes us with you in
[5:26] Christ has anointed us is God.
[5:40] who has also sealed us and given the
[5:44] earnest of the spirit in our
[5:53] hearts of his
[5:55] word. We may be seated. So I want to
[5:58] talk about the earnest of the Holy
[6:00] Spirit.
[6:09] the earnest of the Holy
[6:12] Spirit. Now the
[6:14] earnest is a down
[6:17] payment. Praise the name of our Lord.
[6:20] It's not like you make a
[6:24] deposit on something that you desire.
[6:29] So now the Bible is telling
[6:31] us that we are given the Holy
[6:35] Spirit as a as the
[6:39] earnest as the down
[6:42] payment. And what does the down payment
[6:46] mean? That there is more that is going
[6:49] to
[6:52] come. So now God fills us with the Holy
[6:57] Spirit and then it's an
[6:59] indication that there is more that is
[7:02] going to do for
[7:05] us. There is more that is going to give
[7:07] to
[7:09] us. There is more that is going to fill
[7:12] with
[7:13] us. And you see the hol when the Holy
[7:16] Spirit comes in your
[7:19] life, it confirms to you that you are
[7:24] eternal. You are not a person of just a
[7:29] time. And you see the goodness of the
[7:32] Lord that he gives us the Holy
[7:35] Spirit while we are still living in
[7:38] these mortal
[7:40] bodies, while we are still living in
[7:42] these natural bodies.
[7:45] And then the Holy Spirit goes and fills
[7:49] our
[7:50] hearts. And then the Bible says the
[7:53] hidden man of the
[7:58] heart like let us look at this scripture
[8:00] pastor will make it clearer for
[8:04] us in first Peter chapter
[8:09] 3. Praise the name of our Lord. Brother,
[8:12] if you can help me with some water need
[8:15] to drink water. First Peter chapter 3.
[8:21] And then we read in verse four. Let us
[8:24] start from reading from verse three.
[8:26] book said, he says, "Whose adoning, let
[8:31] it not be the outward adoning of plating
[8:35] of the hair and of wearing of gold or
[8:38] the putting on of
[8:53] appro he's talking about the
[8:57] women you know of course it's natural to
[9:00] look
[9:03] nice you know to see that you are
[9:05] looking
[9:07] nice you know to see that you know
[9:09] everything is okay about
[9:12] you so but then he's
[9:15] saying the
[9:18] adoning your
[9:20] emphasis not just remain on the outward
[9:24] adoning
[9:25] [Music]
[9:28] Because saying whose adorn let it not be
[9:30] the outward adorning of plating of hair
[9:33] and of wearing of gold of putting on of
[9:36] the
[9:45] apparel. Now he's saying that don't
[9:48] adorn
[9:50] yourself. He's not saying you don't put
[9:52] on clothes.
[9:55] But he's
[9:57] saying it should be more than the
[9:59] outward appearance.
[10:04] And then he says in verse four, thank
[10:06] you.
[10:08] But let it be the hidden man of the
[10:10] heart in that which is not corruptible,
[10:14] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[10:17] spirit, which is in the sight of God of
[10:20] great price.
[10:40] So he's saying that the hidden
[10:43] man should be
[10:46] adorned in an
[10:49] incorruptible garment.
[10:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Outside
[10:56] person, you know, you adorn them with
[10:59] change of clothes.
[11:03] Like I remember there's a person I was
[11:06] working with I was working with in
[11:09] Toro and this
[11:12] lady she would put on matching
[11:18] colors. She has put on maybe a a light
[11:21] green
[11:23] blouse green. Then the skirt is maybe
[11:26] dark
[11:27] green. The shoes are also green.
[11:31] The wristwatch is
[11:33] green.
[11:35] Green. The hair pins are
[11:38] green and the back is
[11:41] green. Every shirt to change different
[11:43] colors how we should match them.
[11:48] Nothing wrong with
[11:50] that. He's saying let it go beyond the
[11:53] outward
[11:55] one. Let our
[11:58] adoning the hidden man of the
[12:01] heart be adorned with an incorruptible
[12:04] seed of God.
[12:07] And then he says that one who is
[12:09] incorruptible in the inner
[12:14] man, he says that is of great price
[12:18] before
[12:20] God. Praise the name of our Lord. That
[12:23] is what God
[12:26] values. It is more precious to
[12:30] God than the external one.
[12:34] Praise the name of our Lord. That's a
[12:36] very interesting
[12:38] scripture. If somebody is looking for a
[12:41] wife, see what God
[12:45] values. Praise the name of our Lord.
[12:48] Somebody is looking for a
[12:50] husband. See what God
[12:53] values. The
[12:57] inside. the inside is what God values
[13:02] more than even the
[13:05] outside. How she looks like, how he
[13:08] looks
[13:09] like, what she
[13:11] is, what she has or then maybe what he
[13:17] has the thing is how much value of God
[13:20] has she got
[13:26] in. how much of God is in their
[13:31] inside because that's the incorruptible
[13:35] thing. But then the outside perishes by
[13:40] anything perish any
[13:43] time. Praise the name of our Lord. Can
[13:46] change any
[13:48] time. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[13:50] know like maybe if somebody is
[13:53] attractive after a few years they will
[13:56] start developing
[14:00] wrinkles the body shape is going to
[14:04] change you know many things change about
[14:08] his
[14:09] bodies. So now if you are marrying the
[14:13] body, if you are marrying somebody
[14:15] because of how they look
[14:19] like or what they
[14:21] have, those are temporary
[14:24] things. But then it should be the inner
[14:28] man and then the inner man should be God
[14:32] himself in the inside.
[14:36] If God is in the
[14:38] inside, then you know that this person
[14:40] is
[14:43] reliable cannot change over
[14:47] time because God is inside of
[14:50] him. So now God fills us with the Holy
[14:54] Spirit. And now when we get the baptism
[14:57] of the Holy
[14:59] Spirit, the spirit in
[15:01] us keeps on transforming
[15:05] us changes our
[15:08] mind. Praise the name of our Lord.
[15:11] Renewing
[15:13] us as we go on walking with the
[15:18] Lord. Praise the name of our Lord.
[15:22] Let us first go to
[15:24] Titus then we shall come to Romans
[15:27] chapter
[15:29] 12. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[15:32] Titus chapter
[15:35] 3 and then we read in verse
[15:42] three. For we ourselves also were
[15:47] sometimes foolish, disobedient,
[15:51] deceived, serving diverse lusts and
[15:54] pleasures, living in malice and envy,
[15:57] hateful and hating one another.
[16:26] [Music]
[16:29] He said we were sometimes
[16:34] foolish, disobedient.
[16:44] Then he says, "Deceiving one another."
[16:49] Then he says, "Serving divers
[16:56] lusts and
[16:59] pleasures." That was our condition
[17:01] before we were born again.
[17:05] doing things that are not acceptable
[17:08] before
[17:11] God, living in
[17:13] malice, in
[17:15] envy,
[17:17] hateful and then hating one
[17:19] another. That was our condition
[17:23] initially. And then he says, "But after
[17:27] the kindness and the love of God our
[17:29] savior toward men appeared,
[17:39] not by works of righteousness which we
[17:42] have
[17:48] done. In other words, for you to stop
[17:51] doing those kind of
[17:54] things. It was not your
[17:58] ability. It was not your determination.
[18:02] But he
[18:03] says it was according to his
[18:09] mercy that he saved
[18:12] us by the washing of
[18:17] regeneration renewing of the Holy
[18:23] Spirit. Now, in order for us to overcome
[18:26] the the lusts of the flesh,
[18:32] the pride of life, the lust of the
[18:35] eye. We need to be regenerated by the
[18:39] baptism of the Holy
[18:42] Spirit. And then we need to have the
[18:45] renewal of our
[18:49] mind. In other words, the Holy
[18:52] Spirit keeps on changing our
[18:56] thoughts, keeps on, you know, turning us
[18:58] from things which are not right.
[19:02] The Holy Ghost keeps on renewing
[19:06] us. Praise the name of our Lord. That's
[19:09] why the Holy Ghost is given to
[19:12] us. It makes you a new
[19:15] creation. And when the Holy Ghost makes
[19:18] you a new creation,
[19:21] Then he transforms
[19:23] you, you know, from a bad
[19:26] image to the image of Jesus
[19:30] Christ. That's what the scripture here
[19:32] is
[19:33] saying. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[19:36] then he says which he shed on us
[19:38] abundantly through Jesus Christ our
[19:45] savior. That being justified by his
[19:48] grace,
[19:51] We should be made hairs according to the
[19:54] hope of eternal
[20:04] [Music]
[20:08] life.
[20:11] desire. Lord, change me. Lord, transform
[20:15] me. Lord, deliver me out of this kind
[20:18] of. And then you allow God to take
[20:21] charge over your
[20:23] life. You allow God to make you a new
[20:28] creation. Allow God to give you
[20:31] victory over all your
[20:35] weaknesses. Praise the name of our Lord.
[20:38] Now in Romans chapter
[20:40] 12 and then verse one to verse
[20:44] two he says I beseech you therefore
[20:46] brethren by the mercies of God that you
[20:50] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[20:53] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[20:56] reasonable service.
[21:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Present
[21:12] your
[21:14] body as a living
[21:17] sacrifice which is
[21:20] holy and
[21:22] acceptable unto God. And then he says,
[21:26] "This is your reasonable service."
[21:31] And then he says, "Don't be conformed to
[21:34] this world."
[21:39] In other words, don't allow the things
[21:41] of the world to influence
[21:45] you. Praise the name of the Lord.
[21:48] Besides it, a new fashion that has
[21:51] come, you also run with that new
[21:55] fashion. Praise the name of the Lord.
[21:58] You know those days people didn't want
[22:00] to have gray
[22:03] hair but then they get was it called?
[22:07] Then they put in the hair to make it
[22:11] black. But now want to have gray
[22:14] hair. Nowadays want to have gray hair.
[22:19] You get somebody getting white
[22:24] braids in the head. Then others put
[22:27] green in the head, red in the head,
[22:31] yellow in the head, yellow. And when one
[22:33] does
[22:34] it, then others keep on doing
[22:37] it. Then others want to put on hair like
[22:40] m
[22:42] people. And then others also start doing
[22:45] the same thing.
[22:47] Then others want to make hair like you
[22:49] know hips of potatoes on the
[22:56] head and then others also follow the
[22:58] same thing.
[23:00] So you see the trend keeps on
[23:03] going being conformed to this
[23:08] world functioning like the rest of the
[23:12] world like now you see what's
[23:15] happening they come I think they call
[23:17] them with a legging I don't
[23:19] know just something which is tight on
[23:21] the
[23:23] skin as good as
[23:26] naked and then he puts on a short
[23:30] top and then walks and everybody just
[23:33] follows the
[23:37] same. There's a sister
[23:40] yesterday and I I was just checking then
[23:43] I found on her status of
[23:48] WhatsApp and then what she did she got
[23:52] two women in
[23:55] pants and then you know and then I was
[23:58] wondering why is the sister putting
[24:00] these things on her
[24:03] what? And then the man had braided hair
[24:06] something like that.
[24:10] then ask her,
[24:12] "Hey, what what are you communicating to
[24:14] us by
[24:16] this?" He said, "I like the
[24:21] message." And know she told me, "I like
[24:23] the
[24:24] message, what they were
[24:27] saying." Then I said, "But with people
[24:29] with
[24:34] pants and then a man with braided
[24:38] hair and you think there's a good
[24:40] message to pick from these
[24:44] people." But this is what is
[24:46] happening. We are just picking the
[24:48] world. Whatever the world gives us, we
[24:50] just embrace
[24:52] it. Just embrace it. Just embrace it.
[24:57] You know so it is becoming normal to
[25:01] us. So the Bible says be not conformed
[25:04] to this
[25:06] world but be transformed.
[25:10] just remembered a certain
[25:13] sister and now she was telling the
[25:17] husband since I've got the baptism of
[25:19] the Holy
[25:22] Spirit I don't need to come to
[25:26] church that's what she was telling the
[25:30] husband now that is very strange but
[25:33] when you have a portion of the Holy
[25:36] Spirit you'll desire more of
[25:39] God, praise the name of the Lord. You
[25:42] just desire
[25:44] more,
[25:46] more, praise the name of our Lord. You
[25:49] know that's the danger of teaching the
[25:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then say
[25:52] it is a
[25:56] sensation and then when somebody gets
[25:59] that
[26:03] sensation so I will
[26:06] never I don't need to pray. I don't need
[26:08] to go to church. There's something wrong
[26:09] there.
[26:11] Praise the name of our Lord. But when
[26:13] the spirit of God gets in us,
[26:16] it makes you to yearn for more of
[26:19] God, desire more of
[26:22] God. And you know, the more you realize
[26:24] your
[26:27] weaknesses like now in this, let me read
[26:29] also this message
[26:32] here. Praise the name of our Lord. in
[26:35] the message greater than Solomon is
[26:37] here.
[26:39] He says now he
[26:42] said I'm going to give you the earnest
[26:44] of your
[26:47] salvation. You know the
[26:50] earnest is the down
[26:53] payment. If I wanted to pay a boat from
[26:56] one of
[26:59] you and I went out and
[27:02] said, "How much do you want for the
[27:07] boat?" Then you say, "
[27:11] $2,000." I would say, "Well, I will tell
[27:16] you what I will
[27:17] do. I'll give you
[27:20] $50 to hold it for me until next
[27:26] week. Will you do
[27:28] it? Will you hold it for
[27:31] me? I will do,
[27:35] brother. Then you give me a
[27:38] receipt and I will give you
[27:44] $50. Now, you can't sell that boat.
[27:49] because I got the first bid on
[27:53] it. That's the
[27:56] earnest that I am going to get the
[28:00] boat. It belongs to me. Praise the name
[28:04] of our Lord. That's what the Holy Spirit
[28:07] is. It's a down
[28:10] payment. In other words, there is more
[28:13] that is
[28:15] coming. Now, if you've just got a small
[28:20] portion, how would you say
[28:24] that when there is more to
[28:27] come? So, you would desire
[28:31] everything. So now when you get the
[28:34] baptism of the Holy
[28:36] Spirit, the Bible says that we
[28:41] ourselves, we do
[28:44] grown. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[28:47] can't live on this world and you are
[28:48] contented with what the world is
[28:52] having. You say, "Lord, where is that
[28:56] place?" When God promised
[29:00] Abraham an eternal
[29:03] inheritance, when God first gave him the
[29:05] natural
[29:08] inheritance, the Bible says he was in
[29:11] the land of
[29:13] Canaan as a stranger and a
[29:17] pre and the Bible says he was looking
[29:20] for a
[29:22] city whose builder and maker is God
[29:25] himself.
[29:27] And that's what the Holy Spirit does
[29:29] when he's in our
[29:31] lives. You know, you are always moving
[29:33] out.
[29:34] Lord, I long for that land where there's
[29:37] [Music]
[29:39] righteousness. I long for that
[29:41] land. I long for that
[29:44] condition where I will have no more
[29:47] temptations. I long for that
[29:50] condition. I will have no more troubles
[29:52] the way I'm
[29:53] having. I long for that condition.
[29:56] where I will not feel backachche and
[29:58] headache and everything like
[30:00] that because it's a reality. It is
[30:04] there. So there is a yearning in your
[30:09] heart. Praise the name of our Lord to
[30:12] live in a better condition than what you
[30:14] are living
[30:15] in because God has given you an
[30:18] assurance that surely there is a
[30:21] land. Praise the name of our Lord. There
[30:24] is a learn beyond this.
[30:27] There are better things beyond what we
[30:30] have. So even when you have the things
[30:32] of this
[30:34] life, praise the name of our Lord, it
[30:37] cannot hold you back here.
[30:40] There is a reality in
[30:42] you. There is an eternal portion in
[30:46] you that keeps on moving you like
[30:50] Abraham moving in the land of
[30:53] Canaan as if it is not his but looking
[30:56] for a city whose maker and builder is
[31:00] God. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[31:03] look at Jacob. When Jacob was before
[31:07] Pharaoh, he told Pharaoh, "The days of
[31:10] my
[31:13] primage has been very few and full of
[31:18] evil." So he was looking for something
[31:21] beyond
[31:22] that. And then our Lord Jesus comes and
[31:25] tells
[31:26] us that in the land to
[31:29] come, in the kingdom to
[31:32] come, many will be moving from the east
[31:34] and the
[31:36] west and they'll be going to sit
[31:40] together with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[31:46] Praise the name of the Lord. And the
[31:48] Holy
[31:49] Spirit brings such hope and expectation
[31:52] is in
[31:55] us that there is more that is
[31:58] coming and your heart keeps on longing
[32:00] for more that is
[32:02] coming. Praise the name of our Lord in
[32:05] the city where there is no
[32:07] sorrow in the city where there's no
[32:10] sickness in the city where there is no
[32:13] death. So you just keep on
[32:16] longing. Lord, I want to be there. Lord,
[32:19] I want to be there. Lord, I want to be
[32:21] there. Praise the name of our Lord.
[32:24] That's what the Holy Ghost does in our
[32:25] lives. He keeps that
[32:28] longing, fasting. Lord, I want more of
[32:33] you. Sometimes you do something to
[32:37] somebody. It's not that it is
[32:39] evil, but you find you can do better
[32:42] than that.
[32:44] help me to do better the next
[32:47] time. And so the Holy Ghost keeps moving
[32:49] into
[32:52] you to do better than what you did
[33:00] today. Praise the name of
[33:03] God. Then he said,
[33:10] well, God came back
[33:14] go up there to
[33:16] Jerusalem and I'm going to send the
[33:19] earnest of your
[33:24] salvation. And they were up there all in
[33:26] one accord in one
[33:30] place. And suddenly there came
[33:37] the come down from heaven like a rushing
[33:40] mighty wind.
[33:44] and filled the house where they were
[33:47] sitting. Look here. We can look
[33:51] back and see we were once
[33:56] unbelievers. We seen where we would have
[33:59] walked around a meeting like this and
[34:02] laughed at
[34:05] it. We seen once back there in our lives
[34:08] where we would criticize divine healing.
[34:15] One time we didn't believe in
[34:18] God. One time we didn't believe in his
[34:22] word. But now we have been raised up
[34:25] from
[34:28] that, lifted up, died in
[34:32] Christ, buried with
[34:34] him, raised with with
[34:37] him in his
[34:39] resurrection. and are now sitting in
[34:42] heavenly places in Christ
[34:45] Jesus. And here we are today in the
[34:49] earnest of our salvation.
[34:54] We stand here tonight already
[34:59] dead, buried in
[35:02] Christ and raised with
[35:04] him and sitting in heavenly
[35:08] places, enjoying spiritual
[35:12] things, coming back from the cross, the
[35:19] way heavenly places
[35:22] It makes us shout and think about it
[35:27] like a negro like an old woman a negro
[35:32] woman. She
[35:35] said Dr. I want to give a
[35:39] testimony. Go ahead. Go ahead. Sister
[35:44] testify. She said I want to say this.
[35:50] I ain't what I ought to
[35:54] be and I ain't what I want to be to do
[35:58] to be.
[36:01] But then one thing I
[36:04] know. I ain't what I used to
[36:09] be. So that is
[36:12] good. She know something had happened.
[36:18] I
[36:19] do. Every man that is born of the spirit
[36:22] of
[36:24] God knows you are not what you used to
[36:29] be. I ain't what I want to
[36:33] be. I ain't what I ought to
[36:36] be. I ain't what I used to be either.
[36:41] See, I have raised with
[36:45] him and I'm now on high
[36:49] up waiting for my change to
[36:53] come. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[36:56] need to desire the Holy Spirit in our
[36:59] lives. It picks you like the Bible said
[37:03] the ways of sin. You even hate those
[37:06] things which are not right.
[37:09] And then he changes your
[37:11] mind and then you desire the things of
[37:15] God. Praise the name of our Lord. In the
[37:19] book of Ephesians chapter 1 verse
[37:23] 13, he says, "Nom also you trusted.
[37:27] After that you heard the word of truth,
[37:29] the gospel of your salvation. In whom
[37:32] also after that you believed, you were
[37:34] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
[37:37] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[37:40] until the redemption of the purchased
[37:42] possession unto the praise of his glory.
[38:06] [Music]
[38:10] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[38:12] the Holy
[38:13] Spirit is the earnest of our
[38:21] inheritance and our
[38:24] inheritance is an eternal
[38:30] inheritance. Praise the name of our
[38:32] Lord. And if it is an eternal
[38:36] inheritance and brother Brham says there
[38:39] is only one form of eternal
[38:51] life and
[38:53] that praise the name of our God. Brother
[38:56] Moses called this
[39:00] Zoe. So it says
[39:03] Zoe is God's own
[39:07] life. So when we get eternal
[39:10] life then we are getting a portion of
[39:14] God. And then the Bible says it is the
[39:18] earnest of our
[39:21] inheritance and our inheritance is
[39:25] eternal. In other words, it's a down
[39:29] payment of that portion of
[39:34] God that he has given to
[39:37] us. Now, our souls are
[39:44] eternal by the new
[39:46] birth. But right now, we live in
[39:50] bodies which are not yet
[39:53] eternal. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[39:56] that's why he gives us the down
[40:00] payment. And now that down
[40:03] payment goes to the
[40:06] soul and makes the soul
[40:10] eternal but the body is not yet
[40:14] eternal. Praise the name of our Lord.
[40:17] That's why this
[40:19] body feels
[40:22] pain can be false.
[40:25] can die, grows
[40:29] old because it's not yet
[40:31] eternal. But yet within us, we have an
[40:35] eternal
[40:38] inheritance. We have a portion of God
[40:40] living within
[40:43] us. Praise the name of our Lord.
[40:48] So if you are looking for somebody to
[40:52] marry, brother Khalib is
[40:56] smiling and he's looking for to his
[40:59] friend in the same
[41:02] condition. If you are looking for
[41:04] somebody to
[41:06] marry, look for God in that
[41:11] person. Praise the name of our Lord.
[41:13] Look for God in that person.
[41:16] The other sister who did
[41:20] PCM she got somebody in the
[41:23] church and sometimes you don't know what
[41:25] they
[41:27] doing. We weded them but when the
[41:30] brother
[41:32] came said I had a radio program of a
[41:34] pastor in
[41:39] Campala. Then I wondered you in Ginger
[41:43] and you said the radio program in
[41:44] Campala is the one which you
[41:47] had when we have many radio programs in
[41:51] Ginger and you've not had any of the
[41:53] hours here but you had the one
[41:57] of that was a red
[42:00] flag you of course you hear what they
[42:03] telling
[42:04] you said they directed him to come to
[42:06] this
[42:11] church the other person of the radio
[42:14] program said okay so I've come to be
[42:18] baptized so we baptized him after
[42:21] baptizing him I get the message books
[42:26] and I don't remember the message books
[42:27] but I think two three that was
[42:30] after you can read his message
[42:35] book the Next time I see the
[42:39] brother when he was coming to me, I
[42:42] thought he was coming to ask me
[42:44] questions on the message books I gave
[42:45] him.
[42:49] I thought he was coming to ask me
[42:50] questions on the message books he
[42:54] got. So what he came I went and visited
[42:58] the other
[43:01] family and then the mother said that I
[43:03] can bring my parents to get their
[43:05] daughter.
[43:08] I was
[43:09] like, I'm on this
[43:14] channel. How you what would you do?
[43:17] You're telling him the message
[43:19] books. He's telling you about
[43:25] marriage. Ver unfortunate situation.
[43:29] She got somebody without
[43:33] God, married with a man without
[43:39] God, a man without a
[43:42] head,
[43:48] headless. And at the end of the
[43:50] day, he doesn't have time for
[43:53] church. I'm too busy.
[43:57] What? Can I Can we find time together?
[44:01] I'm too busy. I've been too busy. I've
[44:04] been too busy. Too
[44:07] busy.
[44:09] Trouble marrying a man without
[44:14] God, headless
[44:17] man. Things of God are not concerned
[44:19] about
[44:20] him. How are you going to bring that
[44:23] person under control?
[44:28] Praise the name of our Lord. Then
[44:29] there's another
[44:31] one. He also went and did
[44:35] PCM and some of this know that what
[44:37] you're doing is
[44:41] wrong. Praise the name of the Lord like
[44:44] you know when people are not
[44:48] married or they talking with one
[44:50] another and then they make a mess with
[44:53] one another.
[44:57] They will not trust one another
[44:58] afterwards.
[45:02] So this is this brother says, "I've
[45:05] brought one who is an
[45:08] angel." Ah, she even kneels down and
[45:11] down even if I bring
[45:20] greens six months.
[45:24] He realized who she
[45:26] was. Then he would start reading the
[45:28] Bible.
[45:30] Let us read this Bible.
[45:33] He starts reading the scripture. She
[45:35] starts choosing
[45:38] him. That one is condemning you. It's
[45:41] condemning
[45:44] you. He just stopped that kind of
[45:47] thing. And they're no longer living
[45:49] together.
[45:52] people without
[45:55] God
[45:58] trouble. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[46:00] you need to say that somebody has the
[46:02] Holy
[46:04] Spirit. There's something that can hold
[46:08] them. There is a fear of God that can
[46:10] hold
[46:12] them. Not somebody who is
[46:18] headless. They are still animals.
[46:21] Any person without God is a
[46:26] beast. So don't marry
[46:29] beast. And beasts are always tied in the
[46:34] zoos. I don't know if you're going to
[46:36] make at
[46:38] home to control
[46:41] him
[46:48] appetites night life.
[46:51] in the bar there's a brother also did
[46:56] another
[46:57] one and then when there was a
[47:01] show she goes to the show she doesn't
[47:04] want to leave the
[47:06] show she wants to sleep in the
[47:08] show then he would say sister believers
[47:12] don't do like
[47:15] that but she was not a
[47:18] believer saying believer But you didn't
[47:20] get as a
[47:23] believer
[47:25] headache. So we need to see that we we
[47:28] get people who have the baptism of the
[47:30] Holy
[47:32] Spirit. See the life of the
[47:35] person. Let them have the word of God
[47:37] ruling in their
[47:40] lives. Somebody who has got an eternal
[47:43] inheritance.
[47:47] And then the Bible says that this
[47:50] eternal
[47:52] inheritance is reserved for us in
[47:55] heaven.
[47:58] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us read
[48:00] first Peter chapter 1
[48:03] verse4. He says to an incorruptible in
[48:07] to an inheritance incorruptible and
[48:10] undefiled that fadeth not away reserved
[48:14] in heaven for you.
[48:20] 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 4.
[48:43] So the Bible says this
[48:47] inheritance which is reserved for
[48:50] us is
[48:54] incorruptible. It is not
[48:58] defiled. It fed us not
[49:00] away and it is reserved in heaven for
[49:05] us. Praise the name of our Lord.
[49:09] something which God has reserved for
[49:12] us. Something which God has kept for
[49:17] us. Praise the name of Lord. So when the
[49:20] Holy Ghost
[49:21] comes, you know, it keeps
[49:24] you
[49:28] desiring. And the Bible says in this
[49:31] house we
[49:33] grown to. We desire to be go into the
[49:38] house which is in the
[49:43] heavens. Our inheritance reserved in
[49:46] heaven.
[49:49] So then the Holy Spirit in us
[49:52] now gives us the
[49:55] assurance that there is a house of
[50:00] God which is not built by
[50:03] hands which is eternal in
[50:07] heaven. In 2 Corinthians
[50:14] 5:1 he says, "For we know that if our
[50:18] earthly house of this tabernacle, we are
[50:20] dissolved, we have a building of God and
[50:24] a house not made with hands eternal in
[50:27] the
[50:33] heavens." Um, sorry. 2 Corinthians 5:1
[51:00] For in this we do grown earnestly,
[51:02] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[51:04] house which is from heaven.
[51:14] If so be that being clothed, we shall
[51:17] not be found
[51:23] naked. For we that are in this
[51:26] tabernacle do grown, being burdened, not
[51:30] for what we would be unclothed, but
[51:34] closed upon, that mortarity may be
[51:37] swallowed up of life.
[51:58] So, Praise the name of the Lord. He says
[52:01] we do
[52:03] grown. In other words, there is the Holy
[52:05] Spirit puts a desire in you.
[52:10] to be in that body that's waiting for
[52:14] us, the theophony
[52:17] body, the celestial body in
[52:20] heaven. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[52:23] live in this earthly
[52:25] one, which has a lot of
[52:28] troubles. But when the Holy Spirit comes
[52:31] down, we get an
[52:34] assurance. There is a body waiting for
[52:36] us in heaven.
[52:39] So regardless of what you go through in
[52:41] life
[52:43] here, this is not your
[52:46] focus. Focus is that body right at
[52:50] home. So he says we grown in this one
[52:54] here like Paul. He says I desire to be
[52:58] with the
[53:00] Lord. He says in this body we are absent
[53:04] from the Lord.
[53:10] But then when we get in the other body,
[53:13] we are in the presence of the
[53:16] Lord. Then he says in verse five, now he
[53:20] that has wrought for us the self same
[53:21] thing is
[53:25] God who has also given unto us the
[53:28] earnest of the spirit.
[53:33] He gives us the earnest of the spirit.
[53:36] giving us an
[53:38] assurance there is more to
[53:41] come. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[53:44] have a body in heaven waiting for
[53:47] us. We have an eternal inheritance.
[53:52] And to get this internal
[53:55] inheritance, the Bible says in first
[53:58] Peter chapter
[54:01] one and verse
[54:04] 23, being born again not of the
[54:07] corruptible seed, but of the
[54:09] incorruptible by the word of God which
[54:11] liveth and abideth
[54:15] forever. Verse 23.
[54:18] Okay.
[54:32] Um, praise the name of our Lord. So we
[54:36] need to be born of the incorruptible
[54:42] seat which is the word of God. And then
[54:46] inside we have an incorruptible
[54:51] inheritance. We have the hidden
[54:55] man.
[54:57] Uncorruptible. So he's not subject to
[54:59] the conditions
[55:02] there. Praise the name of our Lord. He's
[55:04] not affected by what the natural body go
[55:08] through because he is
[55:11] eternal. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[55:14] let me try to
[55:16] finish and then we go to this message.
[55:18] The future home of the heavenly
[55:26] bridegroom. He says like he did this
[55:29] like he did
[55:31] us his
[55:33] creation to live in to live
[55:37] in before he could come in it.
[55:42] He had to give us the baptism of
[55:46] fire. Then the Holy Ghost come in and
[55:49] leave.
[55:52] Baptism of
[55:53] fire. Then when you get that baptism of
[55:57] fire, then the Holy Ghost can come in.
[56:03] But as it does,
[56:06] it it burns up
[56:10] everything out of
[56:13] you. It won't it won't believe nothing
[56:16] else but the
[56:20] word. Because it is the
[56:23] word. Now that's what
[56:27] we evidence of the Holy
[56:31] Ghost. The evidence of the Holy
[56:34] Ghost is when you can receive the
[56:39] word not some
[56:41] system but have a clear
[56:46] understand. Do you know the word is
[56:51] clear? Watch
[56:54] it. Vindicate
[56:56] itself. Where do you say I I see do this
[57:00] that
[57:02] Oh yes, the WS live the same
[57:08] way. But it's got to be the entire
[57:13] word to be the
[57:15] bride. You have to be part of
[57:19] him. He is the
[57:21] word. And what part of whom is
[57:25] it? the promised one that's for this
[57:31] day when he calls his
[57:35] bride be a part of
[57:37] it. Praise the name of our Lord. Then
[57:40] there is also in this one here.
[57:44] says still the message the future
[57:47] home says Christ came and called the
[57:50] church
[57:53] repentance baptism in the name of Jesus
[57:57] Christ for the
[57:59] remission sanctify the
[58:01] church and with fire of God come down
[58:04] and burn all
[58:09] filth and come and dwells in the human
[58:12] heart.
[58:15] Now the world to be redeemed for the
[58:16] redeemed
[58:22] person, he uses the same
[58:25] method. He baptized it in
[58:29] water after
[58:31] the
[58:34] destruction, shed his blood upon
[58:38] it, sanctified and claim it.
[58:43] Then he says, "But now it has to go
[58:46] through a baptism of
[58:50] fire, holy fire from
[58:53] God, which cleanses the earth and the
[58:56] heavens around
[59:00] it. Praise the name of Lord." So the
[59:04] world in its
[59:06] condition is ready to be burned
[59:10] up for the redeemed people of God to
[59:12] come and live on
[59:15] earth. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[59:18] the earnest of the Holy
[59:21] Spirit is a down
[59:23] payment meaning that there is more to
[59:27] come. There is more that God has
[59:29] prepared.
[59:32] So the Holy Spirit in us puts that hope
[59:36] in
[59:36] us, that yearning in
[59:39] us, expectation us and then we keep on
[59:43] longing for more of
[59:46] God. Praise the name of the Lord. Like a
[59:49] divine
[59:51] healing, it is a
[59:53] sign that there is a
[59:55] life where there is no becoming sick.
[1:00:01] Praise the name of our Lord. All these
[1:00:03] things are a forward
[1:00:05] test. We are just forward
[1:00:08] testing of the things that are to come.
[1:00:12] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[1:00:13] to desire the Holy Spirit in our lives,
[1:00:16] a down payment, showing us there are
[1:00:19] more things to
[1:00:21] come, a better
[1:00:24] body, a better world to live
[1:00:26] in. Praise the name of our Lord. So let
[1:00:29] us on keep on
[1:00:31] striving
[1:00:33] striving. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:00:36] There's a scripture I think I want to
[1:00:37] read
[1:00:40] last. Praise the name of our Lord in
[1:00:43] first Corinthians chapter
[1:00:45] 9. And then verse
[1:00:48] 25 he says, "And every man that strives
[1:00:52] for mastery is temporate in all things.
[1:01:02] Now they do it to obtain a corruptible
[1:01:05] crown.
[1:01:18] crown. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[1:01:21] have an incorruptible crown ahead of
[1:01:25] us. So keep on
[1:01:27] striving. Do the best you
[1:01:31] can. Stand
[1:01:33] firm. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:01:35] don't allow anything to move
[1:01:38] you. But just stay
[1:01:41] focused. Allow the Holy Ghost keep you
[1:01:43] moving.
[1:01:46] In the name of the Lord, don't look at
[1:01:49] your weaknesses
[1:01:50] now. Don't look at your failures
[1:01:53] now. Look at the
[1:01:56] promise. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:01:58] And keep on desiring more of
[1:02:00] God. And as you keep on looking into the
[1:02:04] word, then the Bible says you are
[1:02:07] changed. So your weaknesses
[1:02:10] today when you become more submissive to
[1:02:13] the
[1:02:14] word they disappear and every day you
[1:02:18] are moving you are being
[1:02:21] transformed into the image of Jesus
[1:02:24] Christ. The more submission you
[1:02:27] do, the more
[1:02:29] becoming kind of know like devoted you
[1:02:34] do, you know, the more you keep on
[1:02:36] overcoming, you keep on gaining, you
[1:02:39] keep on gaining and keeps on
[1:02:41] transforming you. Praise the name of our
[1:02:44] Lord. May God bless
[1:02:46] you. Amen.
