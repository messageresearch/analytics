[18:52] not playing again
[18:54] the foundation
[18:57] of repentance from dead ones
[19:00] because the foundation is being
[19:03] described here
[19:06] the faith towards God
[19:08] the doctrine of the baptisms
[19:14] the resurrection of the Dead
[19:16] you see the doctrine Eternal judgment

[19:23] but we are not going to burn ourselves
[19:26] in that forever

[22:05] class
[22:06] talking by way the teachers would say um
[22:34] why would you kind of neglect the land
[22:39] so it's a matter of a delicate balance
[22:44] but I trust that when the Holy Spirit
[22:47] himself
[22:49] the inside teachers
[22:52] amen opens up to teach you the words
[23:05] for example you know what you don't

[31:45] another might Angel come down from
[31:47] heaven
[31:50] meaning there was one word then I see
[31:54] another one come from Heaven together
[31:59] closed with the cloud and the rainbow
[32:01] was upon his head
[32:05] and his face was as it were the sun
[32:08] Namaste
[32:10] and his feet as pillars of fire
[32:13] Navigator
[32:15] and the yard in his and a little book
[32:21] and he said his right foot upon the sea
[32:25] garage
[32:32] it was in total control
[32:35] may God bless the reading of the world
[32:39] you may be seated
[32:42] so today for
[32:47] we are still Christ in the bridge
[32:51] but the emphasis is his directly coming
[32:55] to the Jews
[32:56] [Music]
[32:59] and you know many people who don't see
[33:02] this message
[33:04] in the right perspective
[33:08] they don't really see
[33:12] you know that
[33:14] uh
[33:16] uh quote in his perspective
[33:21] but before we get to the court I Want To
[33:23] Live Foundation
[33:27] I do not know how long it will take me
[33:32] but I will try my level best to let down
[33:37] uh something that will help us to
[33:40] understand Revelation 10.
[33:46] and then we shall keep carrying on with
[33:49] it
[33:51] so I want to let the foundation first
[33:55] and I want you to know that and it came
[33:58] to pass
[34:00] in the days when the judges rule
[34:05] that there was a farming in the land it
[34:08] is
[34:09] so in those days
[34:11] grace for the people oh
[34:16] was always upheld by one man
[34:20] and that was the judge that was given in
[34:24] the season
[34:26] and you know when you look at the book
[34:29] of the judges
[34:31] you just keep looking at it exactly the
[34:34] moving of the seven churches
[34:41] there were seven cycles of the judges
[34:54] there was some I mean cycles that had
[34:57] more than one job
[35:00] and then the last cycle
[35:04] is
[35:07] losing his eyesight
[35:10] amen last three weeks we dealt with
[35:15] naked Souls foreign
[35:20] [Music]
[35:31] [Music]
[35:37] [Music]
[36:05] [Music]
[36:25] but in the days when the judges rule
[36:30] there was a famine in the land
[36:33] because you know the grace was only
[36:36] upheld by one person
[36:39] you see you know uh if I can say
[36:44] is the same thing with most of our
[36:47] Believers
[36:49] most times the people just enjoy the
[36:54] grace of the pastor of the church he
[36:56] said everything about them
[36:58] [Music]
[36:59] and sometimes our young people
[37:02] they just enjoy the grace that the Paris
[37:06] of race demanded
[37:09] and that was exactly the time
[37:13] when the judges
[37:26] amen we do not look to the grace given
[37:30] to our past
[37:33] we need every one of us to dig in the
[37:36] world
[37:37] and to be able to touch the grace of God
[37:43] because we saw here at the other time
[37:46] but the token is personal to the holders
[37:51] you cannot have the token for your local
[37:54] church
[38:01] and some of the young people
[38:04] they just ask under the grace
[38:07] that's the parents have raised them
[38:11] amen amen but the best they can show you
[38:15] that the tradition of the world
[38:19] exemplary
[38:21] because they say we have never smoke
[38:25] never used any drugs
[38:28] amen they are very respectful
[38:32] amen amen praise the Lord but you are
[38:36] cold
[38:37] to make you a calling an election
[38:42] amen amen the good character the person
[38:47] can give you
[38:48] is the correct of the
[38:51] richest
[39:03] they made leaks with the inhabitants of
[39:06] the land
[39:07] and they did not throw away those uh he
[39:11] I mean the altars of the heaven God
[39:15] foreign
[39:20] [Music]
[39:30] [Music]
[39:36] [Music]
[40:34] [Applause]
[40:56] [Music]
[41:13] are continuous
[41:15] there is nothing like a justification
[41:18] stuff
[41:20] sanctifications
[41:39] [Music]
[42:03] so everyone Junction of Grace
[42:06] is present continuous
[42:11] we live in them daily
[43:14] foreign walking God keeps crossing his
[43:18] own borders
[43:20] through those Junctions
[43:22] with his child
[43:24] amen amen you have gone up here but then
[43:29] he says okay you've got the best Mothers
[43:32] but you've got a problem
[43:36] it cropped up yesterday
[43:38] oh it came growing through the time
[43:43] he can take you back again
[43:46] it's a stage of sanctification
[43:48] it's actually not taking you back
[43:52] because that stream is
[43:58] the stream of Grace
[44:00] but with three Junctions
[44:10] being justified free I'll come out
[44:52] a major
[44:54] [Music]
[45:17] but you need this more
[46:09] [Applause]
[46:16] it's a continuing process
[46:19] you know
[46:36] it's a continuing revelation of holiness
[46:44] a life of prayer
[46:47] dedication where are you all those
[46:49] things they keep breaking before you and
[46:53] you obey we are going down that's your
[46:55] sanctification
[46:56] amen Amina John 17 19.
[47:00] let's look at the sanctification of
[47:04] Christ
[47:06] the sanctification of Christ who has
[47:09] dedication for the purpose
[47:12] because that's what sanctification is
[47:15] set aside before service
[47:23] [Music]
[47:24] I Sanctified myself
[47:27] that they also might be Sanctified
[47:31] through the truth
[47:33] Jesus says I sanctify myself yes
[47:38] meaning that I keep myself in the volume
[47:41] of the book
[48:04] reading the message
[48:28] [Music]
[48:31] for the purpose
[48:35] are you together with the man what is it
[48:38] I wish you not that statement for the
[48:40] purpose
[48:42] let's go to Acts chapter four
[48:45] verse
[48:54] because they had gone out to preaching
[49:11] the place was shaken where they were
[49:13] assembled together thank you foreign
[49:39] are you together with one is you cannot
[49:41] say justifications
[49:49] it's one stream
[49:52] amen called Grace
[49:54] praise God I'm brother Branham teachers
[49:59] that's the Dynamics in Germany of this
[50:02] church will be a revealing of the Holy
[50:05] Spirit
[50:07] that's the Dynamics that's the moving
[50:11] dynamics of the church
[50:14] is
[50:19] what keeps the church
[50:25] some of the tribes of Israel
[50:28] did not destroy the men of the land
[50:32] and the Man became thought round
[50:51] their entire life
[50:54] for Christ every Christian
[50:58] he came because he had a bothering
[51:01] disease
[51:03] when the hands were laid on him
[51:06] and then got healed he said oh thank you
[51:13] he did not know that even the little
[51:15] things
[51:17] that was at the bottom of the Heart
[51:20] Like a mini spirit
[51:23] amen despising people
[51:27] little fights back and forth
[51:30] a working time
[51:32] to a problem
[51:50] the night of our confession
[51:56] the night of our confession
[52:01] the problem is
[52:06] you considered the greater problem you
[52:10] had at the time
[52:21] not the Great
[52:25] the great every weight
[52:27] and the scene which does so easily
[52:31] besirt Us
[52:33] in the continuing process of
[52:36] sanctification
[52:46] amen Amina so laying aside
[52:50] by believing the world
[52:56] amen amen because when Revelation breaks
[53:00] from the world
[53:10] foreign
[53:59] by staying away from the world
[54:09] Uganda
[54:11] everything that's in the Bible
[54:14] has got a purpose
[54:18] under the car is electricity a certain
[54:22] form of anointing
[54:27] amen Amina you can never say I love a
[54:31] cam 20
[54:32] when you start from the world
[54:35] you don't study your Bible you don't
[54:39] come to church you cannot claim any form
[54:42] of Victory
[54:44] amen Amina Hebrews
[54:48] God puts a believer
[54:51] in a state of chastisements
[55:12] in the days when the judges wrote
[55:17] but there was a famine in the land
[55:24] I want you to absorb that
[55:26] is
[55:29] when the judges ruled however I was ever
[55:32] forgot
[55:33] Grace was held for the People by one man
[55:38] it is
[55:43] and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah
[55:45] went to surgeon in the country of Moana
[55:48] um
[55:59] foreign
[56:44] [Music]
[56:46] are you together with me when is it when
[56:49] you are you say man
[56:52] so judges
[56:57] look at the people in the land of
[57:00] Israeli in the days of the judges
[57:03] and the people served the Lord all the
[57:07] days of Joshua
[57:10] and all the days of the elders that have
[57:13] lived Joshua
[57:16] who had seen all the great works of the
[57:19] Lord
[57:21] for Israel is
[57:27] [Music]
[57:40] and that was the condition
[57:44] that Israel was in during the time of
[57:47] the judges
[58:02] are you together with me when is it they
[58:05] are not back into the world
[58:08] and yet they were supposed to be the
[58:10] teachers
[58:11] and because they can't put these things
[58:15] together
[58:17] then they start saying the prophet was
[58:19] wrong
[58:21] this is the time which we are living
[58:24] here
[58:27] [Music]
[58:29] foreign
[58:31] [Music]
[59:12] praise the Lord
[59:13] you see you go back in every
[59:17] congregation
[59:19] there is a testimony
[59:22] about the elders
[59:25] they had
[59:28] you know a personal experience with God
[59:30] right enough
[59:33] like we used to hold services for a full
[59:36] week
[59:37] number and the entire church used to
[59:40] come
[59:43] foreign
[59:52] [Applause]
[1:00:06] but when they die are you always Judges
[1:00:10] chapter 2 verse 10.
[1:00:13] and also that generation were gathered
[1:00:16] unto their fathers
[1:00:21] another generation after them
[1:00:25] reaching you not the Lord
[1:00:28] nor yet The Works
[1:00:31] which he had done for his wife
[1:00:34] and the children of Israel
[1:00:37] in the sight of the Lord
[1:00:41] they had an experience
[1:00:48] so the evil the kids
[1:00:53] was to serve another God challenge
[1:00:58] that's what you see now yes
[1:01:01] they go and serve another God
[1:01:06] no experience
[1:01:08] we want a church
[1:01:10] that will dig into the message
[1:01:13] and you said this message is
[1:01:18] and you get proud about it I need young
[1:01:22] people that will view the personal
[1:01:25] testimony
[1:01:28] amen Amina in the land mostly amen amen
[1:01:32] at that time their Joy
[1:01:36] was listening to motivational preachers
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:02:00] that will lend them to the foundation
[1:02:04] and the purpose
[1:02:11] and you know and when they came into
[1:02:15] church
[1:02:16] they could not catch up with the
[1:02:19] teaching of the holocausts
[1:02:23] get the messages
[1:02:31] you bled the tapes but at the same time
[1:02:34] be feed on the wall

[1:30:45] these seven sealed books
[1:30:49] is revealed at the time of the seven
[1:30:53] wonders of Revelation 10.
[1:30:59] and then he quotes the scripture we've
[1:31:01] used
[1:31:03] then he says if you notice
[1:31:06] that is Christ when he says and I saw
[1:31:10] another Angel
[1:31:12] because he in the Old Testament
[1:31:17] was called the end of the confidence

[1:34:14] Israel Israeli was The Junction to the
[1:34:17] Nations
[1:34:21] amen amen so Israel I mean Israel gave
[1:34:26] to us the gospel yet
[1:34:29] is that right how did they give it to us
[1:34:33] by rejecting it
[1:34:38] praise God so then Acts chapter 13.
[1:34:43] if the Jews have refused
[1:34:46] we now turn to the Gentiles
[1:34:51] foreign
[1:35:00] now when we talk about the gospel
[1:35:03] we are not talking about the
[1:35:06] denomination
[1:35:08] we are talking about the message of the
[1:35:11] hour
[1:35:13] the moment you see that people begin to

[1:36:24] and these feet are Spillers
[1:36:34] and
[1:36:38] he's left upon the Earth
[1:36:51] in the
[1:36:53] Angel's hand
[1:36:55] could only be revealed

[1:37:14] coming to the Jews
[1:37:21] the rejecting people
[1:37:23] then finally to the Jews
[1:37:29] okay got it so brother Branham says
[1:37:33] he's coming directly to the Jews
[1:37:38] at that statement is
[1:37:41] Right
[1:37:43] following that in according to the
[1:37:46] Gentiles
[1:37:49] the Jews he
[1:37:51] is
[1:37:53] coming to the Gentiles
[1:37:56] he will be able to catch the Jews
[1:38:00] foreign
[1:38:27] [Music]
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:43] [Music]
[1:38:51] under the
[1:38:53] I succeed
[1:38:57] because the seventh seed is silence
[1:39:05] you need to connect these things
[1:39:08] that's the same day
[1:39:11] Israel became a nation
[1:39:14] being gathered back
[1:39:18] into the land of Israel
[1:39:20] to wait for their Messiah
[1:39:23] for their Redemption
[1:39:26] under the seventh trumpet
[1:39:34] is the same thing the age of the Lord
[1:39:38] came to the prophet to commission him
[1:39:45] foreign
[1:40:14] so the message of the Covenant
[1:40:18] comes to fulfill Daniel 10. I know to
[1:40:23] increase Daniel 12. which is connected
[1:40:27] to Revelation 10.
[1:40:30] redeeming Daniel's people
[1:40:33] and that way
[1:40:38] are connected together
[1:40:41] between the sixth and the seventh seals
[1:40:47] at the time of the opening of The Bible
[1:40:51] Hallelujah what's the book being open
[1:40:54] foreign
[1:40:59] amen
[1:41:14] are you together with me
[1:41:16] so we just want to link Daniel 12.
[1:41:20] and Revelation 10.
[1:41:24] amen Amina Daniels
[1:41:28] is connected to Daniel
[1:41:49] please please
[1:42:09] I Daniel
[1:42:11] understood by books the number of years
[1:42:16] is it Daniel
[1:42:19] now
[1:42:42] Israel here this is
[1:42:44] 70 years before this is
[1:42:52] but because of disobedience
[1:42:56] God allowed Nebuchadnezzar
[1:43:01] the king of Babylon
[1:43:04] to take these people
[1:43:07] into Babylon for
[1:43:12] chastisements
[1:43:18] I never left the message
[1:43:24] I kept myself in the message
[1:43:27] and I understood by books
[1:43:33] are you going to study tonight
[1:43:36] amen Daniel understood by books
[1:43:44] you to say that they were going to be
[1:43:47] redeemed
[1:43:49] out of Babylonia and be taken back to
[1:43:53] Jerusalem
[1:43:54] to rebuild the Temple okay foreign
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:15] [Applause]
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:26] [Applause]
[1:44:54] we actually
[1:45:34] he's talking about two
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:34] then we shall go beyond that
[1:46:37] and then come to this season yeah
[1:46:47] [Applause]
[1:46:53] [Music]
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:12] so from the time Daniel received the
[1:47:15] Commandments
[1:47:17] of the restoration of the temple in
[1:47:20] Jerusalem
[1:47:24] would be six to nine weeks
[1:47:31] so the professor spoke of the time
[1:47:35] from the Commandments
[1:47:44] which would be 69 weeks
[1:47:48] I'm wearing down
[1:47:51] prophetically
[1:47:56] praise the Lord
[1:47:59] look how perfect it was
[1:48:08] a sacrifice in the middle of the week
[1:48:34] to continue for a full week
[1:48:42] are you together with me one is it and
[1:48:44] the full week is how many years
[1:48:51] but then the scripture says in the midst
[1:48:54] of the week it is
[1:49:00] meaning that when Jesus right now he
[1:49:04] would be able to Ministry for three and
[1:49:07] a half yes
[1:49:15] so he was cut off
[1:49:19] he could not go all the seven years
[1:49:27] three and a half years
[1:49:30] of the last week of the prophecy
[1:49:34] then there is still three and a half
[1:49:37] years
[1:49:38] which we are waiting for because
[1:49:49] I want you to understand this is
[1:50:04] now among the Gentiles
[1:50:08] Hallelujah that's why you are here
[1:50:11] that's why you're a Believer
[1:50:16] the Jews rejected
[1:50:22] so this is our season this is our time
[1:50:26] this is our disposition
[1:50:31] amen amen God gave it to us
[1:50:35] so there is this time because you know
[1:50:38] where we are now great Liberty this is
[1:50:40] where we find the seven Church ages
[1:50:44] [Music]
[1:50:58] this is where Revelation 10 is
[1:51:01] [Music]
[1:51:04] that
[1:51:06] entire Redemption
[1:51:09] has to be finished
[1:51:12] but yet at this time I want you to be
[1:51:16] very emphatic in the queen
[1:51:18] at the closing of this time
[1:51:26] begins to awaken the Jews
[1:51:30] that's their time is over
[1:51:33] to say time is over Saturday
[1:51:37] and when time is over it's going on
[1:51:40] the Jews
[1:51:43] are trying to make laws
[1:51:46] in their country that Christianity
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:52:07] will start walking away from the message
[1:52:13] and what will God do because directs to
[1:52:16] the Jews
[1:52:18] and time shall be over
[1:52:27] praise the Lord don't ever ask me let me
[1:52:29] try to make it clear here
[1:52:31] so from Calvary to death
[1:52:35] the 70th week
[1:52:43] now listen here I'm trying to finish in
[1:52:46] the shortest time possible
[1:52:49] and in the midst of this week
[1:52:55] amen Amina now if this exactly was seven
[1:52:59] years
[1:53:01] each of the weeks
[1:53:03] and we've already had six to nine weeks
[1:53:07] then we have got the Gentile age
[1:53:10] [Music]
[1:53:12] okay so now let me say this you know
[1:53:17] that this message
[1:53:18] is one unit
[1:53:21] foreign
[1:53:23] this message is
[1:53:25] one unit like in the Bible is one unit
[1:53:30] called the word of God
[1:53:34] and even this message
[1:53:38] called the message
[1:53:42] in over one thousand messages
[1:54:07] you know the way it does in one of the
[1:54:11] messages
[1:54:15] told us that the 70th week
[1:54:21] that we shall get the quote I think
[1:54:24] there remains one week
[1:54:28] seven years
[1:54:31] and some people say yeah
[1:54:35] you look at this question
[1:54:40] he said seven years
[1:54:44] seven years
[1:54:46] but he picks it up later
[1:54:49] in the bridge
[1:54:51] and he says
[1:54:53] Messiah was cut off in half the week
[1:54:57] so we've got another half weeks
[1:55:03] which is three and a half years
[1:55:05] amen and it does not give one revelation
[1:55:10] and then
[1:55:12] he changes it
[1:55:14] what he does chocolate
[1:55:16] so the prophet says God can't give a
[1:55:19] fast Revelation is
[1:55:25] changing his mind
[1:55:33] when he promises
[1:55:40] had to come through Abraham and then
[1:55:44] later said it would be by the Bloodlines
[1:55:47] but it was the same Revelation it only
[1:55:51] gave the people more information
[1:55:59] so let us go by the same principle here
[1:56:02] and bringing the bridge
[1:56:05] Amen in the last half weeks
[1:56:10] [Music]
[1:56:13] the prophet says that's the end
[1:56:17] when the tribulation period comes
[1:56:20] now here is a little thing we are going
[1:56:24] to reverse back a minute
[1:56:28] where the three and a half years of
[1:56:31] Daniel's 70 weeks is
[1:56:37] the last half of Daniel 70 weeks
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:43] which is three and a half years
[1:56:47] how many remembers that from the church
[1:56:50] ages
[1:56:52] there is 70 weeks
[1:57:01] and will be cut off Foreign
[1:57:21] [Music]
[1:57:27] for the
[1:57:31] you know because of the overspread of
[1:57:33] the Abominations
[1:57:43] amen down that Calvary and then the
[1:57:48] chastisement of what they did
[1:57:53] amen Amina you see because they
[1:57:56] contained in the overspread of
[1:57:58] abomination
[1:58:00] foreign
[1:58:06] [Music]
[1:58:27] so he has to go back to the Jews
[1:58:33] but via the Gentiles
[1:58:37] and that's how he's connecting us to
[1:58:40] revelation 10.
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:48] because in Daniel welcome Daniel he says
[1:58:51] that that time
[1:58:53] your people shall be ready
[1:58:59] amen amen but then again by the opening
[1:59:04] of the Bulls
[1:59:07] we find that we also connected together
[1:59:10] around the same time
[1:59:13] amen amen at this time Daniel sees the
[1:59:18] season of redemption of the names
[1:59:25] so Daniel chapter 12.
[1:59:31] and at that time shall Michael stand up
[1:59:35] that great Prince which stand there for
[1:59:38] the children of thy people
[1:59:42] a time of trouble
[1:59:48] even to the same time
[1:59:54] people shall be delivered
[1:59:57] everyone that shall be found written in
[2:00:01] the book
[2:00:03] Hallelujah now listen
[2:00:06] at that time
[2:00:08] [Applause]
[2:00:11] the great Prince
[2:00:14] for the children of the people
[2:00:18] hallelujah
[2:00:23] and again
[2:00:27] he sees the same Mighty Angels
[2:00:33] standing right there so I want us to say
[2:00:38] that at the closing of time yeah
[2:00:47] like there was
[2:00:50] a season of the overallah between
[2:01:00] amen amen it happened so simultaneously
[2:01:06] by having near me
[2:01:14] they gave us the gospel we had it
[2:01:18] immediately
[2:01:19] amen amen and that's the end of it that
[2:01:23] will be also a novel you are rejecting
[2:01:26] it
[2:01:28] so it's true characters of Revelation 10
[2:01:31] work we create Community is coming
[2:01:33] directly to the Jews
[2:01:35] like in the Book of Ruth he was coming
[2:01:39] directly for us
[2:01:46] amen Amina so that's the time that John
[2:01:50] desires
[2:01:53] since we believe in the principle of the
[2:01:55] overlap
[2:01:57] the redeeming of the name
[2:02:01] begins with the Gentiles
[2:02:05] at the ending of the time
[2:02:09] when the remnant will stand up and say
[2:02:13] and to whom shall we go
[2:02:17] you've got the words of eternal life
[2:02:20] as the servant walk away there will be a
[2:02:25] genuine belief that will hold this
[2:02:29] message and be taken to the Rapture and
[2:02:33] at that time
[2:02:35] I mean the Jew comes
[2:02:40] amen
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:03:08] it was the opening of the six seals
[2:03:13] when he got to the seventh seal himself
[2:03:17] he told us
[2:03:23] and so this spider over here
[2:03:26] was about the seventh seal the coming of
[2:03:30] the Lord is
[2:03:32] I prefer to go in Luke chapter 21 yes
[2:03:37] because it is

[2:04:39] when they now shoot forth wherever you
[2:04:43] see and know of your own Souls that
[2:04:46] summer is not at hand
[2:04:52] then the prophet says

[2:08:31] we keep looking at our prophecies
