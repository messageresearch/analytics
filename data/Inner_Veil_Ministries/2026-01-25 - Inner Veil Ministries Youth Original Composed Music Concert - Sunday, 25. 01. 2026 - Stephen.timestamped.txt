[34:18] amen. Amen. Maybe before I continue
[34:22] there's a brother called Joseph. Has he
[34:25] reached?
[34:29] He has not yet reached. Okay. Let us go
[34:32] to the book of Exodus.
[34:36] Exodus chapter 15.
[34:40] We reading from verse one.
[34:44] The Bible says,
[34:46] &gt;&gt; "Then sung Moses and the children of
[34:48] Israel this song unto the Lord, and
[34:52] spoke, saying, I will sing unto the
[34:54] Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously
[34:58] the horse and his rider as it thrown
[35:01] into the sea.
[35:17] The Lord is my strength and my song and
[35:20] he is become my salvation. He is my God
[35:25] and I will prepare him an habitation, my
[35:28] father's God and I will exalt him.
[35:46] The Lord is a man of war. The Lord is
[35:48] name
[35:52] and this has cast into the sea. His
[35:54] chosen captains also are drowned in the
[35:55] Red Sea.
[36:02] The death have covered them. They sunk
[36:04] into the bottom as a storm.
[36:08] Thy right hand, oh Lord, is become
[36:10] glorious in power. hand as the enemy
[36:17] and the greatness of excess
[36:20] against the Lord says thy thy which as
[36:31] the prophet the sister of Aaron took in
[36:33] her hand and all the women went out of
[36:35] her house with Sing
[36:41] it to the Lord for he has enough.
[36:49] Amen. Amen. So I just want to take some
[36:52] time
[36:54] maybe 1 hour or less
[36:58] then we shall continue with our songs
[37:00] maybe for another one hour.
[37:04] We shall maybe break up at break up
[37:06] break off at 2
[37:10] then at 3 we come back again.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; We've given the whole day to praise the
[37:15] Lord.
[38:45] Praise the name of our Lord. So from the
[38:47] text that we have read,
[38:50] I want to to minister on the subject.
[38:54] Songs carry a message.
[38:58] Praise the name of the Lord. Songs carry
[39:01] a message.
[39:04] songs have a message.
[39:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Like we
[39:09] were singing this song that the children
[39:11] of Israel sang.
[39:16] You know they had just crossed the Red
[39:18] Sea.
[39:20] And you know the Red Sea was like
[39:22] burying everything
[39:26] that tormented them.
[39:30] All the leaders of their task masters
[39:34] were all drowned in the sea
[39:38] spiritually
[39:41] by the power of God.
[39:43] Praise the name of our Lord and
[39:45] sometimes we look at the stress we go
[39:47] through life
[39:49] and then we sometimes get scared of
[39:52] distress.
[39:54] But yet God has a purpose in every
[39:58] situation
[40:00] that you know he can bring that
[40:01] situation to an end
[40:05] like when the children of Israel
[40:08] were leaving Egypt.
[40:10] At first Pharaoh could not allow them to
[40:12] leave Egypt.
[40:14] He wanted to hold them bondage.
[40:18] You know, he wanted them to continue
[40:19] serving him.
[40:21] Until when Moses told him, "Let my
[40:24] people go that they may serve me in the
[40:27] wilderness."
[40:29] Pharaoh sought it. They have a lot of
[40:32] free time.
[40:34] So let us give them more work.
[40:37] And sometimes that sometimes can come to
[40:40] our mind
[40:42] or maybe your family or your friends
[40:45] thinking that the time you put in the
[40:48] things of God,
[40:51] you are wasting time or you don't have
[40:53] what to do really.
[40:55] But you see God requires us
[40:58] to give him time.
[41:01] And when you come before the presence of
[41:03] God, he says, "Be still,
[41:08] be quiet."
[41:10] You know,
[41:12] be calm. Don't be in a hurry.
[41:16] Like when we come here in the presence
[41:18] of God,
[41:20] relax.
[41:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Put
[41:24] everything down
[41:26] and then be quiet there. Then allow God
[41:32] to come and speak to you
[41:35] now in the message God providing healing
[41:38] for this generation.
[41:41] Brother Brandham says
[41:44] he says but I want to ask you
[41:50] something.
[41:51] You know I do not know you.
[41:54] Now, he was in the in the prayer line.
[41:58] And you see, brother Brham,
[42:01] even other prophets or people who really
[42:05] wait on God,
[42:07] even the people that wait on the Lord.
[42:11] You must take your time,
[42:14] your precious time, and then you wait on
[42:17] the Lord. You don't want to be in a
[42:20] hurry here or a rush the other side. So
[42:24] now he was telling them
[42:27] now we just got plenty of time.
[42:33] Don't be in a rush.
[42:37] You get to rushing.
[42:42] The Holy Spirit is very timid.
[42:48] it easy
[42:50] and I don't want you to rush
[42:57] when is the service ending. Now you can
[43:00] imagine today we have a program of 23
[43:03] songs
[43:06] and then your mind starts troubling.
[43:09] Do you mean we're going to leave this at
[43:10] night?
[43:12] Don't be in a rush.
[43:18] Come down.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Come down.
[43:23] You know if you're going to receive from
[43:24] the Lord,
[43:26] come down.
[43:28] Even when you have many troubles,
[43:32] just come down.
[43:34] Praise the name of the Lord. And when
[43:36] you are come, you can hear well.
[43:41] Praise the name of the Lord. You can get
[43:43] the right answer back.
[43:47] You know just that's what God wants us
[43:50] to do when you come into his presence
[43:54] here. Brother Brandham was telling them
[43:57] just come down
[44:00] wait on the Lord.
[44:03] Praise the name of our Lord like the way
[44:05] Elijah was telling Elisha
[44:08] if you see me taken away from you.
[44:13] So then all Elisha's mind
[44:16] was to be turned to Elijah
[44:20] because Elijah was strange that day.
[44:24] He says, "God has sent me here. When
[44:27] they reach there, then he say again, God
[44:30] has sent me here." He was wondering, but
[44:33] he was patient.
[44:36] And the Lord requires that patience with
[44:37] us
[44:39] that when you go to pray,
[44:42] wait on the Lord, be calm. So he says,
[44:49] then I want you to be deep in prayer
[44:55] and do this
[44:58] while this song is being played.
[45:02] Then Jesus came,
[45:05] &gt;&gt; delivered the maniacs.
[45:09] He set the captive free.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; He is here tonight to do the same thing.
[45:17] Praise the name of our Lord. So then you
[45:19] hear the music
[45:22] with, you know, a desire to understand
[45:27] what is this song saying.
[45:31] Praise the name of the Lord. Like you
[45:33] know the songs that have been sung.
[45:35] You know every song has a depth of
[45:38] meaning.
[45:41] Every song is inspired.
[45:45] Every song has a message it gives you.
[45:49] And when you take time meditating upon
[45:51] it,
[45:53] it will also change your confession.
[45:57] Praise the name of Lord. like brother
[46:00] Brham
[46:01] &gt;&gt; in the Brham tabernacle tabernacle. Then
[46:03] he went he went in the early times of
[46:06] his ministry
[46:08] when he entered the church there was a
[46:11] brother called I think Paul Ryder
[46:14] &gt;&gt; and then he was singing a song
[46:19] believe
[46:21] only
[46:23] believe
[46:25] all things are possible and then he said
[46:30] &gt;&gt; that's the time the angel had revealed
[46:32] himself to
[46:35] Then he said the angel was pleased about
[46:37] that song
[46:40] until that song the theme
[46:44] of all the revivals was moving around.
[46:48] It had a meaning because the Bible says
[46:52] only believe
[46:55] all things are possible. Praise the name
[46:57] of our Lord. And so when you have that
[46:59] song with you
[47:02] even when you are in hard conditions
[47:04] and then say let me get to sing to the
[47:06] Lord. Only believe only believe all
[47:11] things are possible
[47:13] and then your faith
[47:15] gets up. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[47:18] you don't get afraid of the stress
[47:20] you're going through.
[47:23] So songs have a message.
[47:26] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[47:28] you need to sing a song
[47:30] and that song as you sing it,
[47:34] it changes your feelings.
[47:37] Praise the name of our Lord, it changes
[47:40] your emotions.
[47:43] When we go to the scriptures,
[47:45] a man like Elisha,
[47:48] a whole prophet of God,
[47:51] you know, when he saw
[47:54] the son of Ahab
[47:57] coming
[47:59] with, you know, with, you know, another
[48:02] king of Israel,
[48:05] the man's spirit was troubled.
[48:09] And so now when the spirit was troubled,
[48:14] you know, like you know, he's
[48:15] disappointed
[48:18] like we go through some circumstances in
[48:20] life and then you get yourself
[48:23] disappointed.
[48:26] Sometimes you're broken down maybe of
[48:29] what you've heard or what you have seen
[48:33] like a lot in Sodom. The Bible says his
[48:37] righteous soul.
[48:40] was vexed,
[48:42] you know,
[48:47] &gt;&gt; by the things that he saw, by the things
[48:51] that he had. And we see we are living in
[48:54] Sodom and Gomorrah.
[48:56] We are living in an evil environment.
[48:59] We are we are working in an evil
[49:01] environment.
[49:03] Sometimes your neighborhood is evil.
[49:06] You put here your house or your
[49:09] residence, your neighbor is playing
[49:11] secular music
[49:13] to the top of it. So it troubles you. It
[49:18] vexes you. So even the prophet
[49:22] when you know he saw this son of Ahab,
[49:27] it troubled him.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; So his spirit
[49:32] was grieved.
[49:35] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[49:37] told them, "Bring me a mistro."
[49:42] Praise the name of our Lord. And now
[49:44] when they brought him a mistro,
[49:47] that's when the spirit of the Lord was
[49:49] able to come.
[49:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[49:54] to the book of Second Kings.
[49:58] Second Kings
[50:03] chapter 3 and then verse 14.
[50:08] The scripture says
[50:11] &gt;&gt; 2 Kings 3:14
[50:28] Okay, let us start from
[50:32] let us start from verse 10.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; And the king of Israel said, "Alas, the
[50:39] Lord has called these three kings
[50:41] together to deliver them into the hand
[50:44] of Moab.
[51:05] But Joseph had said, "Is there not here
[51:08] a prophet of the Lord that we may
[51:11] inquire of the Lord by him?" And one of
[51:14] the king of Israel's servants answered
[51:16] and said, "Here is Elisha, the son of
[51:19] Shafett, which poured water on the hands
[51:22] of Elijah.
[51:39] And Joshua said, "The word of the Lord
[51:41] is with him." So the king of Israel and
[51:43] the king of Edom went to him.
[51:54] said unto the king of Israel, "What have
[51:55] I to do with you? Get the prophet and
[51:58] the prophet your mother." And the king
[52:00] of Israel said unto him, "Nigh, for the
[52:01] Lord has delivered things together to
[52:03] deliver them into the hand of Mo.
[52:15] as the Lord. Surely were it not that I
[52:18] prese
[52:20] nor
[52:30] you know he felt hurt
[52:33] saying why don't you go to the to the
[52:35] prophets of your father
[52:39] why don't you go there why do you come
[52:40] to us
[52:42] so then that made him troubled
[52:46] And brother Brandham calls it,
[52:49] &gt;&gt; he got righteous indignation.
[53:58] You know,
[54:00] and so now the spirit of God would not
[54:02] work in that kind of environment
[54:06] because he was upset.
[54:09] And so now even you see in the first
[54:11] quote we read
[54:13] when brother Brandham would be in the
[54:15] prayer line, he would tell the people,
[54:17] "Come down.
[54:19] Don't walk up and down, coming in, going
[54:23] out. He said you upset the Holy Spirit.
[54:28] In other words, you hindered the Holy
[54:30] Spirit
[54:32] from going further
[54:34] to move and there are some situations
[54:37] also in our lives
[54:39] that can hinder the work of God
[54:44] in our lives or in the things that we
[54:46] are doing.
[54:48] So now here was the prophet anointed of
[54:51] God.
[54:53] But then he was upset,
[54:56] you know, he was troubled
[54:59] and the prophet knew that the spirit of
[55:02] God cannot work in that kind of way.
[55:06] Praise the name of God. Like when people
[55:08] were coming to the prayer line,
[55:11] brother Brandham would tell them, "Come
[55:13] down."
[55:15] But now when you look at some of these
[55:17] televisions,
[55:19] when somebody's coming, they're scared,
[55:23] they are shaking,
[55:27] and then they wave their hand, they
[55:29] fall. That's not how the Holy Spirit
[55:32] works.
[55:34] Praise the name of our Lord. He wants
[55:36] you to come down.
[55:40] Listen.
[55:42] So the the prophet then he knew how to
[55:46] get back into the spirit.
[55:50] Praise the name of the Lord and see how
[55:52] the prophet told them.
[55:56] Verse 15.
[55:58] But now bring me a mistro.
[56:03] And it came to pass when the mist plague
[56:09] that the hand of the Lord came upon him.
[56:14] Praise the name of Lord. That's why it
[56:16] is important for us
[56:19] to come to church early enough
[56:23] that you can hear the mro playing.
[56:26] You can be part of the song service.
[56:30] Then those demons that trouble you about
[56:33] your debts
[56:35] will go away.
[56:37] Praise the name of you have enough
[56:40] faith.
[56:42] These days are not anything before me.
[56:46] Why? Because the spirits have gone away.
[56:50] Those demons that trouble you maybe at
[56:54] home, at a place of work, they will go
[56:57] away. And you know when brother Brandham
[57:00] was discerning
[57:02] the demons would manifest themselves
[57:04] like darkness
[57:08] darkness. So you would see the whole
[57:10] groom darkness all over
[57:14] and then he tries to press through
[57:18] giving some testimony
[57:20] giving something.
[57:22] The darkness starts reducing
[57:26] and then he sees a light somewhere in
[57:28] one corner
[57:30] and then he gets further into that to
[57:34] increase the faith of the people and as
[57:37] he keeps on pressing on. You see the
[57:40] darkness has gone away. The whole place
[57:42] is white
[57:45] milky.
[57:47] Then he says now faith is here.
[57:51] Then he tells everybody
[57:54] you are here. If you know you are sick,
[57:58] raise up on your feet and stand. Even
[58:00] people who come from the wheelchairs,
[58:03] everybody was standing rejoicing because
[58:05] of the power of the Lord.
[58:08] Praise the name of our Lord. And even
[58:10] when we come to church, we need to come
[58:12] for deliverance.
[58:14] We need to come. If there is distress
[58:17] troubling you, there is this demon that
[58:19] bothers me, let it be released from you.
[58:24] Praise the name of Lord. So when they
[58:26] played the mistro,
[58:28] the spirit of the Lord came down upon
[58:30] the prophet.
[58:31] And then he was able to see the mind of
[58:33] God. And whenever we come to church, let
[58:37] us come. Lord, I've come to learn your
[58:40] counsel. I've come to know your mind.
[58:43] There's something troubling me at place
[58:45] of work. There's something troubling me
[58:47] at home. There's something troubling me
[58:49] at my my my life.
[58:52] Lord, help me to know your will. So when
[58:54] you come, come to be delivered.
[58:58] Praise the name of our Lord. So when
[59:00] they play the music,
[59:02] the Holy Spirit came back.
[59:05] Even King Saul, the Bible says he had an
[59:09] evil spirit
[59:12] in 1st Samuel 16:14.
[59:18] And then verse 14,
[59:20] but the spirit of the Lord departed from
[59:23] Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord
[59:26] troubled him.
[59:46] And Saul's servant said unto him,
[59:48] "Behold now, an evil spirit from God
[59:52] troubles you." Amen.
[1:00:02] Let our Lord now command
[1:00:05] thy servants which are before you to
[1:00:08] seek out a man who is cunning player of
[1:00:12] a harp, a mistro. And it came to pass
[1:00:15] when the evil spirit from God is upon
[1:00:17] you that he shall play with his hand and
[1:00:20] thou shalt be well.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:46] Praise the name of Lord. Troubled by an
[1:00:47] evil spirit. You may also be troubled
[1:00:50] with different things. But here the
[1:00:52] Bible says get the right music
[1:00:56] the demons will leave the name of maybe
[1:00:58] at your home. You come back from work so
[1:01:01] troubled so down. Put on your music.
[1:01:07] You know the people of the world they
[1:01:08] have music that consoles them. They go
[1:01:11] in their funny things there you know and
[1:01:13] the world have particular music
[1:01:17] but the music which mostly the world
[1:01:20] music about women.
[1:01:23] Somebody playing.
[1:01:26] Then there's another one who sang a
[1:01:27] music about being disappointed.
[1:02:01] I'm tired,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; different musics
[1:02:07] and then there are people
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; who now put that music on their status.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; It may not be music, it may be a photo.
[1:02:17] a message.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; How could you do this?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; They put it there on the status.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; You know, music has a message.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:02:33] the music that can bring us deliverance
[1:02:38] should be the music that is focused on
[1:02:41] God.
[1:02:44] Praise the name of God. Music that is
[1:02:46] praising God.
[1:02:49] Music that is bringing back the
[1:02:51] scriptures to you.
[1:02:54] Music that's taking you into worship.
[1:02:59] Music that brings you into the presence
[1:03:01] of God.
[1:03:04] Like Elisha
[1:03:05] said, "Come and play to me."
[1:03:08] You know David had written many psalms.
[1:03:12] So now they would come and start playing
[1:03:14] those songs.
[1:03:16] And when they start playing those songs,
[1:03:19] then the Holy Spirit would come down.
[1:03:22] And when the Holy Spirit comes down,
[1:03:25] the station changes.
[1:03:28] So he had David was anointed by God.
[1:03:33] He had a skill.
[1:03:36] Praise the name of Lord. So when he
[1:03:38] started playing,
[1:03:41] you know, the demons that were on Saul,
[1:03:45] they left him and then he was relieved.
[1:03:48] Praise the name of our Lord. You even
[1:03:50] see that the systems of the world,
[1:03:54] you know, like in in the security
[1:03:56] forces, all different organizations,
[1:04:00] they have a band,
[1:04:05] you know, they have kind of like a
[1:04:07] department of music,
[1:04:11] you know, it encourages them when they
[1:04:13] going to work. Then they can sing and
[1:04:15] sing and sing
[1:04:17] and then fear goes away.
[1:04:20] Where they are going is not walking in a
[1:04:23] parking.
[1:04:28] No, there is death.
[1:04:30] But they go there with courage
[1:04:33] because of the singing that they sing.
[1:04:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Now if
[1:04:39] those things can help them naturally,
[1:04:42] how about us spiritually?
[1:04:46] Praise the name of our Lord. No wonder
[1:04:48] the Bible says
[1:04:50] praise the name of our Lord that you
[1:04:52] know sing a song.
[1:04:55] The Bible says is there anybody sick?
[1:04:59] Pray.
[1:05:00] Is there anybody Mary?
[1:05:03] Sing a psalm.
[1:05:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Sing sweet
[1:05:08] melody unto the Lord.
[1:05:12] Praise the name of our Lord. So when
[1:05:14] David started playing
[1:05:17] Saul was relieved.
[1:05:20] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:05:23] to verse 21.
[1:05:26] The Bible says, "And David came to Saul
[1:05:29] and stood before him, and he loved him
[1:05:31] greatly, and he became his army
[1:05:34] armbbearer."
[1:05:45] And Saul sent to Jesus, saying, "Let
[1:05:47] David, I pray thee, stand before me, for
[1:05:50] he has found favor in my sight."
[1:06:02] And it came to pass when the evil spirit
[1:06:05] from God was upon Saul that David took
[1:06:09] an harp and played with his hand. So
[1:06:13] Saul was refreshed and well, and the
[1:06:16] evil spirit departed from him.
[1:06:36] Praise the name of our Lord. When he had
[1:06:39] the song,
[1:06:41] he was praise the name of our Lord. Take
[1:06:44] time. Listen to this message.
[1:06:48] the message in the song.
[1:06:52] Play these songs over and over.
[1:06:55] Meditate upon them.
[1:06:58] That's how their impact will come down
[1:07:00] in your life.
[1:07:04] Praise the name of our Lord. Maybe you
[1:07:06] are playing them
[1:07:08] maybe at your place of work. Now I don't
[1:07:11] mean maybe you are an officer.
[1:07:17] So you put your loud music.
[1:07:22] I want all of them to know
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; it's not that there are systems that can
[1:07:27] make you have that music. Listen to
[1:07:29] yourself.
[1:07:34] Amen. Without somebody saying you are
[1:07:36] interfering.
[1:07:40] Praise the name of the Lord. Take time
[1:07:41] listen to it on your journeys.
[1:07:46] Take time listen to it at home. Take
[1:07:49] time listen to it. Why don't you learn
[1:07:51] them yourself?
[1:07:54] Praise the name of the Lord. You know
[1:07:55] you learn it by heart. Amen.
[1:08:00] And then when some comes
[1:08:03] then the mind is able to recall
[1:08:07] and then you start singing that song.
[1:08:10] Sometimes you can sing it in your heart,
[1:08:13] you know, it has an impact in your life.
[1:08:17] Praise the name of you. You may not be
[1:08:19] able to get another singer to move with
[1:08:21] you or
[1:08:25] praise the name of our Lord. Or you say,
[1:08:27] Joshua, let us be moving with you and
[1:08:28] you sing for me.
[1:08:33] Praise the name of our Lord. But we have
[1:08:35] recorded voices.
[1:08:38] Praise the name of our Lord. So you get
[1:08:39] that voice,
[1:08:41] declare it, you are moving. Praise the
[1:08:45] name of our Lord. And you know music can
[1:08:48] bring souls to Christ.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. They can
[1:08:53] draw people to Christ.
[1:08:56] You know music like we have seen here
[1:09:00] casts out demons.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; It casts out demons.
[1:09:05] Music can bring healing.
[1:09:09] Praise the name of the Lord. It does a
[1:09:11] lot.
[1:09:13] Praise the name of our Lord. Like in
[1:09:16] Kenya,
[1:09:17] some of the farms there, dairy farms,
[1:09:22] when they want to get more milk from the
[1:09:24] cow,
[1:09:26] they go and play some sweet music there
[1:09:28] for the cow.
[1:09:31] And they milk and the cow gives more
[1:09:33] milk.
[1:09:38] praise the name of our Lord. How about
[1:09:40] us?
[1:09:42] Like if you have troubles at home,
[1:09:45] put good music
[1:09:48] to cast those demons of complaining all
[1:09:50] the time.
[1:09:54] Every day we don't have sugar
[1:09:57] and then you learn how to survive
[1:09:59] without sugar.
[1:10:02] But not that's not to say if you're a
[1:10:05] husband
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; and the wife is telling you I want sugar
[1:10:09] then you put the symbol
[1:10:19] if you have little children at home
[1:10:22] they may not listen to your songs
[1:10:29] but Music has an impact.
[1:10:33] It brings a change.
[1:10:36] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:10:39] to
[1:10:41] Psalms 137.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Psalm 137.
[1:10:48] Praise the name of our Lord. These were
[1:10:51] children of Israel.
[1:10:54] They were in Babylon.
[1:10:58] And then the the captures
[1:11:02] they started telling them
[1:11:05] we want to hear
[1:11:07] of the songs of Zion.
[1:11:11] You see what their testimony was.
[1:11:15] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:11:18] Psalms 137
[1:11:22] verse one says, "By the rivers of
[1:11:25] Babylon, where there we sat down, yeah,
[1:11:29] we wept, we remembered Zion,
[1:11:50] You know they were taken in captivity
[1:11:54] and then they remembered the worship
[1:11:58] in the temple mount.
[1:12:00] How I wish I was back to the temple.
[1:12:04] Praise the name of our Lord. How I wish
[1:12:06] I was there,
[1:12:08] you know, to hear
[1:12:10] the music being sung.
[1:12:13] Until the Bible says when Solomon was
[1:12:16] dedicating the temple
[1:12:19] and then they were singing
[1:12:22] the musicians were one voice
[1:12:26] and then they were singing songs of
[1:12:28] praise.
[1:12:30] We can pick that scripture and then we
[1:12:32] come back to this.
[1:12:34] Praise the name of our Lord in 2
[1:12:36] Coronicles chapter 5
[1:12:42] and then verse 13.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass as the trumpeters
[1:12:48] and singers were as one to make one's
[1:12:52] sound be heard in praising and thanking
[1:12:54] the Lord. When they lifted up their
[1:12:57] voice with trumpets and symbols and
[1:13:00] instruments of music and praised the
[1:13:03] Lord, saying, "For he is good, for his
[1:13:07] mercy endures forever."
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; That the house was filled with a cloud,
[1:13:13] even the house of the Lord.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Verse 13,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; chapter 5, verse 13. Second Chronicles.
[1:13:32] Fore! Foreign! Foreign!
[1:13:59] Praise the name of the Lord. The Bible
[1:14:01] says they sung
[1:14:04] as one.
[1:14:06] Praise the name of the Lord. You know
[1:14:08] you may be gifted
[1:14:11] but your gift
[1:14:14] needs to be polished.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:14:21] like the singing we are singing today
[1:14:25] songs we are receiving today
[1:14:28] is not something that has come only one
[1:14:29] day.
[1:14:31] It has taken time.
[1:14:34] working upon it,
[1:14:36] working upon it. Praise the name of our
[1:14:39] Lord. And if you even you when you want
[1:14:43] to be perfected in your gift,
[1:14:46] you need to exercise it.
[1:14:50] You need to put it to testing.
[1:14:53] You're not going to get get an
[1:14:54] instrument and then just start playing
[1:14:57] it.
[1:15:02] and I can just get
[1:15:07] God has the way he works out. Praise the
[1:15:10] name of the Lord. He has a way
[1:15:14] how he works out. He gives you the
[1:15:17] skill,
[1:15:19] but the skill also develops.
[1:15:23] Praise the name of the Lord. It grows.
[1:15:27] It must be trained.
[1:15:30] And to be trained, to be tutored,
[1:15:34] you must be humble.
[1:15:38] And to work as a group,
[1:15:41] to be in harmony with others,
[1:15:44] it takes humility.
[1:15:47] Praise the name of Allah. I can't sing
[1:15:49] with them.
[1:15:51] Then there's something wrong with it.
[1:15:54] Praise the name of It takes discipline.
[1:15:58] Like in football matches,
[1:16:01] you get some of these good talents.
[1:16:05] But if they don't have discipline
[1:16:08] to work with others,
[1:16:11] that gift is no good.
[1:16:14] Praise the name of our Lord. They give
[1:16:16] you the ball. You You want to show that
[1:16:19] you're the only person on the football
[1:16:20] team.
[1:16:25] I'm greater than them.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Take
[1:16:27] one. Put here the ball. Put the ball.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And you know some stations when people
[1:16:33] are doing as a group some want to grab
[1:16:36] the mic from others
[1:16:40] and then when they moving working as a
[1:16:42] group
[1:16:44] maybe you have one mic
[1:16:47] the other wants to personalize it.
[1:16:52] not seeing the voices come together to
[1:16:53] that.
[1:16:58] So there should be discipline.
[1:17:02] There should be you know bearing with
[1:17:04] one another.
[1:17:08] Praise the name of our Lord not an issue
[1:17:10] of competition.
[1:17:13] I'm better
[1:17:15] if I was not there
[1:17:18] nothing would happen.
[1:17:20] No,
[1:17:22] you just humble yourself
[1:17:25] and thank God. If you are better than
[1:17:27] another person,
[1:17:29] support them to go together.
[1:17:32] Praise the name of the Lord. How you can
[1:17:34] move together,
[1:17:35] how you can improve.
[1:17:38] Praise the name of our Lord because
[1:17:40] every joint
[1:17:42] has to supply.
[1:17:44] But if it's only your joint supply,
[1:17:48] the impact will be less.
[1:17:51] But if every joint can supply,
[1:17:55] praise the name of our Lord, it will be
[1:17:56] very glorious.
[1:17:59] So they had to sing in harmony.
[1:18:02] And the Bible says when it was only one
[1:18:05] voice
[1:18:07] and God was pleased with it, then the
[1:18:10] glory of God came to
[1:18:13] praise the name of Lord. And that's the
[1:18:15] harmony that we should have
[1:18:18] in our lives. in our families, even us
[1:18:22] as a church, we need to have that
[1:18:24] harmony.
[1:18:26] Praise the name of Lord.
[1:18:30] Praise the name of our Lord that
[1:18:32] everything may be done,
[1:18:34] led of the spirit of God.
[1:18:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:18:40] back to Psalms 137.
[1:18:44] The Bible says, "By the rivers of
[1:18:47] Babylon, there we sat down." Yeah, we
[1:18:51] wept when we remembered Zion.
[1:19:03] upon the willows in the midst thereof.
[1:19:19] Now you can imagine
[1:19:21] they were in sorrow,
[1:19:24] they were in bondage
[1:19:27] but then the music were not being
[1:19:30] played.
[1:19:33] They were not playing.
[1:19:35] They were not singing.
[1:19:37] What a gloomy condition that is.
[1:19:42] We shouldn't allow that to happen in our
[1:19:44] lives
[1:19:46] where the devil completely binds you
[1:19:51] until there's nothing good. You see,
[1:19:56] praise the name of the Lord. Don't allow
[1:19:58] your life to get to such a condition
[1:20:01] and then you just have the yesterday.
[1:20:09] You know last brother S's family song
[1:20:11] has a song about
[1:20:13] years
[1:20:18] you know seeing you know how can we get
[1:20:21] things better
[1:20:24] praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[1:20:26] to see
[1:20:28] we don't get into this condition.
[1:20:32] You are in captivity.
[1:20:34] You are bound. Even your hop
[1:20:39] is hung there.
[1:20:44] You come to church
[1:20:47] you are bound.
[1:20:49] When the song leader says
[1:20:51] let us rise up and sing.
[1:20:56] Why is he disturbing us?
[1:20:58] Want to see it?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; What a terrible condition.
[1:21:02] But get in the spirit
[1:21:05] here. The song leader
[1:21:08] is led by the spirit
[1:21:11] like a Miriam
[1:21:13] was leading the women
[1:21:15] and then she got the timber
[1:21:18] and then all the women followed up.
[1:21:22] Praise the name of the Lord. We need to
[1:21:23] get into the spirit of worship.
[1:21:27] When we come here to church, praise the
[1:21:29] name of our Lord. If you have been
[1:21:31] disappointed somewhere,
[1:21:34] when you come to church, I have come to
[1:21:37] worship.
[1:21:38] Praise the name of the Lord. I have come
[1:21:40] to worship the Lord. Whether I don't
[1:21:43] have a job or I have a job, I have come
[1:21:47] to worship the Lord. Whether I have food
[1:21:49] at home or I don't have food at home, I
[1:21:52] have come to worship the Lord. Whether
[1:21:55] I'm sick, I'm not sick, I have come to
[1:21:59] worship the Lord. Praise the name of the
[1:22:01] Lord. And the Bible says, "Let the weak
[1:22:05] say.
[1:22:06] I am strong." Praise the name of our
[1:22:08] Lord. It's a positive confession.
[1:22:12] I don't want to hang my when I'm in a
[1:22:14] church.
[1:22:17] I don't want to keep my mouth quiet
[1:22:19] when I'm in the presence of the Lord.
[1:22:22] Praise the name of the Lord. So you get
[1:22:24] into the spirit.
[1:22:27] Praise the name of the Lord. Don't allow
[1:22:29] the devil to start troubling you. You
[1:22:32] what you are singing, you don't know.
[1:22:35] No. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:22:38] know, like the song which was sung,
[1:22:41] it's the blood
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; that atones for our souls.
[1:22:46] And brother Brandham teaches us that the
[1:22:49] blood is the word. So when we come in
[1:22:53] the presence of God,
[1:22:55] there is enough blood
[1:22:58] to wash us from all unrighteousness.
[1:23:02] Now the devil can tell you. Last night
[1:23:05] you did this and this.
[1:23:08] Last week you did something.
[1:23:10] When you come into the presence of God,
[1:23:13] allow that blood to wash.
[1:23:15] Praise the name of the Lord. Be
[1:23:17] cleansed.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. When Isaiah
[1:23:22] was in his presence, he identified his
[1:23:25] sin.
[1:23:27] Oh Lord, my lips.
[1:23:30] He confessed it. And then he got the
[1:23:33] cleansing.
[1:23:35] And we have enough cleansing right here.
[1:23:38] Praise the name over. Say, Lord, wash
[1:23:40] me. Lord, wash me. Lord make me whole.
[1:23:46] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[1:23:48] Bible says they hung their hops.
[1:23:52] And then they said in verse three, for
[1:23:54] they are they that carried us away
[1:23:56] captive required us a song. And they
[1:24:00] said, they that wasted us, required us
[1:24:03] of mass, saying, sing unto us one of the
[1:24:06] songs of Zion.
[1:24:30] How shall we sing the Lord's song in a
[1:24:33] strange land?
[1:24:38] Praise the name of our Lord. They were
[1:24:40] wondering,
[1:24:41] "We are captives.
[1:24:44] We are bound.
[1:24:46] Then these people are telling us
[1:24:49] to sing unto them."
[1:24:54] And this is what the world is doing.
[1:24:57] They want to get the Lord song
[1:25:00] and sing it in a strange place.
[1:25:08] They want to get a song
[1:25:11] like when they having their discos the
[1:25:13] whole nightclubs.
[1:25:17] Maybe they have drunk too much. They
[1:25:20] have danced too much. They are very
[1:25:22] tired.
[1:25:23] They are disappointed.
[1:25:26] Then they want to put on a song
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; and they put them in the morning
[1:25:36] around 3, four, five there
[1:25:40] after doing all the dirty things that
[1:25:44] they just like that.
[1:25:47] You know, you hear them in the places
[1:25:48] where we live when there is a when they
[1:25:51] are going to have maybe a party the
[1:25:53] following day,
[1:25:55] maybe an introduction
[1:25:57] or what. So the whole night is playing
[1:25:59] funny music.
[1:26:03] Now at around 3 4
[1:26:06] then they want to sing the Lord song
[1:26:11] in a strange place.
[1:26:15] That's what the world is.
[1:26:18] They want to sing the Lord's song in a
[1:26:20] strange place
[1:26:23] just trying to soo themselves
[1:26:26] to take gospel music in our way.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Then they put on Jes
[1:26:36] and they can keep on dancing.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; They have that music that soothes them
[1:26:43] in that kind of area.
[1:26:48] But if you get real anointed music,
[1:27:06] You know the Bible says that the
[1:27:10] prostitutes
[1:27:11] they also have a song.
[1:27:15] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:27:17] to the book of Isaiah chapter 23.
[1:27:22] And then verse 15.
[1:27:25] And it shall come to pass in that day
[1:27:28] that Tyra shall be forgotten seven years
[1:27:32] according to the days of one king. After
[1:27:35] the end of seven years shall Tyra sing a
[1:27:38] song as a hallot.
[1:28:03] Take an h, go about the city, though
[1:28:07] harot that has been forgotten, make
[1:28:09] sweet melody, sing many songs that you
[1:28:13] may be remembered.
[1:28:25] So they have their songs
[1:28:28] and they said they sing
[1:28:31] to be remembered.
[1:28:37] Yeah. One composed that song. Don't you
[1:28:39] remember? And those songs.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Now if music can cast out demons,
[1:28:47] Music can bring demons into your life.
[1:28:53] What song are you listening to?
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. What do you
[1:28:58] like? Because these songs have spirits.
[1:29:03] They carried demons.
[1:29:07] You get a song of some of these pop
[1:29:10] stars,
[1:29:13] the demons just get a hold of you.
[1:29:17] Like you get little children now, they
[1:29:18] can dance around, roll, break dance.
[1:29:26] They want to act like a chameleon.
[1:29:32] One is on the back, one is on the legs,
[1:29:34] one is doing this. You know, so many
[1:29:36] styles,
[1:29:38] so many things. But the message in the
[1:29:42] songs,
[1:29:44] the message in the songs we should
[1:29:46] listen to
[1:29:50] should be Christ.
[1:29:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Not
[1:29:54] praising some woman,
[1:29:57] not praising some politician,
[1:30:00] not praising your place of work, but
[1:30:03] praising the Lord.
[1:30:05] That should be our message
[1:30:08] in the songs that we listen.
[1:30:11] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[1:30:12] will bring deliverance,
[1:30:15] to bring healing, it will increase your
[1:30:17] faith.
[1:30:19] Praise the name of our Lord, music that
[1:30:22] has God
[1:30:24] as the theme.
[1:30:27] Praise the name of Lord. Now, just as I
[1:30:30] finish, let me read this quote.
[1:30:32] In the message Christ the mystery of God
[1:30:34] revealed.
[1:30:36] Brother Brandham says now he was saying
[1:30:39] that all psalms
[1:30:43] and all the prophets
[1:30:45] spoke of him. Well, there therefore
[1:30:49] that shows the all the Old Testament,
[1:30:54] all of the New Testament,
[1:30:57] and all of the psalms,
[1:30:59] the singing, the songs that we sang, we
[1:31:05] are sung of him.
[1:31:08] Praise the name of our Lord. That's the
[1:31:10] music we should desire to listen to.
[1:31:12] Those are the songs you desire to listen
[1:31:14] to.
[1:31:16] something that brings Christ
[1:31:19] before you. Praise the name of Lord.
[1:31:22] Then he says, take Psalm 22
[1:31:26] and sing it and compare it with the
[1:31:29] morning of crucifixion.
[1:31:33] See, my God, my God, why have you
[1:31:37] forsaken me? All my bones
[1:31:41] stare at me.
[1:31:45] They pierced my feet
[1:31:48] and my hands. Yet all those things there
[1:31:53] them singing the psalm
[1:31:56] down there in the temple and crucifying
[1:31:59] the very one.
[1:32:04] those great religious leaders,
[1:32:07] those great men, those great teachers,
[1:32:11] and they were so blinded
[1:32:14] that was reading the prophets
[1:32:17] and singing the songs and doing the same
[1:32:21] crime
[1:32:26] that they said they would do.
[1:32:30] How strange it is. Praise the name of
[1:32:32] our Lord. So we need
[1:32:36] songs with a message
[1:32:38] and let that message
[1:32:41] become real to our lives.
[1:32:44] When I'm singing only believe,
[1:32:48] let that be my confession.
[1:32:51] Lord, I believe. Lord, I receive. Lord,
[1:32:54] I accept.
[1:32:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Let the
[1:32:58] music bring such
[1:33:01] praise the name of our Lord. I sing it
[1:33:04] in my heart.
[1:33:05] I testify about the goodness of the
[1:33:07] Lord. Transformation
[1:33:11] in my life.
[1:33:13] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:33:15] to Ephesians chapter 5
[1:33:19] and then verse 18.
[1:33:23] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:33:25] The Bible says, "And be not drunk with
[1:33:28] wine, wherein is excess, but be filled
[1:33:32] with the spirit."
[1:33:35] Ephesians 5:18. So,
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; speaking to yourselves in psalms and
[1:33:54] hymns and spiritual songs, singing and
[1:33:58] making melody in your heart to the Lord.
[1:34:18] Now he says
[1:34:21] speaking to yourself.
[1:34:24] In other words, you are speaking to
[1:34:26] yourself.
[1:34:32] How do you speak to yourself?
[1:34:36] You have maybe some trouble
[1:34:39] and now you can speak to yourself
[1:34:47] and then now you have some trouble
[1:34:52] and then you remember
[1:34:54] not by power,
[1:34:57] not by might
[1:34:59] but by my spirit.
[1:35:02] You get it? whose spirit God is spirit
[1:35:06] not my strength
[1:35:08] not my ability in the trouble that I'm
[1:35:11] going through but by the spirit of God
[1:35:16] I know who knows yourself you're
[1:35:20] speaking to yourself
[1:35:22] I know that this mountain
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; shall be moved
[1:35:29] it's a song but as you sing it. You are
[1:35:33] speaking to yourself.
[1:35:37] You are confessing it.
[1:35:40] Praise the name of our Lord. Each of us
[1:35:43] has that liberty.
[1:35:46] Praise the name of our Lord. Maybe you
[1:35:48] are in trespasses,
[1:35:51] too much.
[1:35:53] Then you remember the song. There is a
[1:35:56] fountain.
[1:35:58] You are speaking to yourself.
[1:36:01] There is a you know you sing it and then
[1:36:06] you know the the song when you look at
[1:36:10] it he went through different phases.
[1:36:14] I just want to look at the different
[1:36:16] paragraphs on this song
[1:36:20] 54.
[1:36:22] He first confesses
[1:36:25] there is a fountain
[1:36:27] from Emmanuel's vein.
[1:36:31] And then he says sinners,
[1:36:34] he opens the door to everybody.
[1:36:38] Then he starts testifying.
[1:36:41] There was a dying thief.
[1:36:44] Now you can imagine a dying thief
[1:36:48] finding that fountain. How about you?
[1:36:52] Then he says again the dying lamp.
[1:36:58] Then he says, "Ever since by faith
[1:37:02] and then he confesses to himself,
[1:37:06] praise the name of our Lord how that
[1:37:08] fountain
[1:37:10] can bring me to deliverance."
[1:37:12] So the Bible is saying, speaking to
[1:37:16] yourselves,
[1:37:18] you yourself speaking to yourself
[1:37:22] the situation you are going through.
[1:37:25] Get that song that matches your
[1:37:28] condition
[1:37:30] and sing it.
[1:37:32] Praise the Lord about it.
[1:37:35] Tell God he cannot overcome this
[1:37:38] condition.
[1:37:40] Praise the name of Allah. So he says
[1:37:42] speaking to yourself
[1:37:44] in psalms, in hymns, spiritual songs,
[1:37:49] singing and making melody in your heart
[1:37:54] unto the Lord. Praise the name of those
[1:37:57] demons go away. Fear goes away. This
[1:38:01] changes. Why? Singing a spiritual song.
[1:38:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:38:09] says, "Giving thanks always
[1:38:13] all things unto God
[1:38:16] and the Father in the name of our Lord
[1:38:18] Jesus Christ."
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. We thank
[1:38:22] God. We have many songs
[1:38:27] spiritually inspired
[1:38:29] that we can sing to ourselves
[1:38:33] and the environment changes
[1:38:36] the atmosphere changes in Colossians
[1:38:39] 3:15
[1:38:42] the Bible says and let the peace of God
[1:38:45] rule in your hearts to which also you
[1:38:48] are called in one body and be thankful.
[1:39:02] Let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:39:05] richly in all wisdom, teaching and
[1:39:08] admonishing one another in psalms and
[1:39:12] hymns and spiritual songs, singing with
[1:39:16] grace in your hearts to the Lord.
[1:39:39] And whatever you do in word or deed, do
[1:39:42] all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:39:45] giving thanks to God and the Father by
[1:39:47] him.
[1:39:59] Praise the name of the Lord. Everything
[1:40:02] we do in the name of the Lord. Do in the
[1:40:05] word of God. All our songs that we need
[1:40:09] to listen to,
[1:40:11] let them be about the word of God.
[1:40:15] What the Lord has done.
[1:40:17] Praise the name of God. the things that
[1:40:19] the Lord is promising to do to us.
[1:40:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So songs
[1:40:26] must have a message. Praise the name of
[1:40:28] our Lord. And even as singing,
[1:40:31] take time,
[1:40:33] listen to that message in the song.
[1:40:36] Not only enjoying the melod,
[1:40:40] not only enjoying how everything is
[1:40:41] going on.
[1:40:43] I like the arrangement.
[1:40:47] I like the way she dressed up.
[1:40:50] I liked this.
[1:40:52] You're missing the message.
[1:40:56] Get that song. Let it bring a message in
[1:41:00] your heart.
[1:41:01] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[1:41:03] one will always live with you
[1:41:08] and will help you in the time of need.
[1:41:11] Amen. May God bless you so much.
[1:41:15] Amen. Amen. I just want to invite
[1:41:17] brother Joshua.
[1:41:20] Praise the name of our lord. There is
[1:41:22] that song brother Joshua su
[1:41:25] says is it I will sing a song. I will
[1:41:28] sing a what is it? So
[1:41:31] that's why I sing. Let us first sing
[1:41:33] that song. I just like it.
[1:41:36] Praise the name of God bless you.
[1:41:43] This is
[1:42:23] singing to the King of Kings. Can we get
[1:42:25] on our feet?
[1:42:29] Amen. That's why I sing. That's why I
[1:42:32] praise

[2:09:45] the still waters. He restoth my soul. He
[2:09:49] leadeth me into the paths of
[2:09:52] righteousness for his name's sake. Yeah,

[2:09:58] shadow of death, I will fear no evil,
[2:10:01] for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy
[2:10:04] staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a
[2:10:08] table before me in the presence of my
[2:10:11] enemies. Thou anointest my head with
[2:10:14] oil. My cup runth over. Surely goodness
[2:10:18] and mercy shall fall. Follow me all the
[2:10:22] days of my life and I will dwell in the
[2:10:25] house of the Lord forever. Be blessed.

[2:23:15] uh from uh the message victory day
[2:23:19] and uh
[2:23:24] I'm just going to read it here. The
[2:23:26] brother will type. It says,
[2:23:30] I think that the word victory is a great
[2:23:33] word in the English language. It means
[2:23:36] that you have defeated the enemy and
[2:23:39] you've overcome and you are a victor
[2:23:41] holding victory and we sing songs and
[2:23:44] share a victory. When you you have a
[2:23:48] trial or a test, it shows the grace of
[2:23:51] God has found as you have found favor
[2:23:55] with God and God believes that you stand
[2:23:58] the test. When it looks like everything
[2:24:02] is gone wrong, God is giving you a
[2:24:04] trial. He's got confidence in you. You
[2:24:08] don't have to baby you around. You are
[2:24:11] not a hot bed plant hybrid. You are a
[2:24:15] real Christian. God is giving you a test
[2:24:18] to see that to see what you will do
[2:24:20] about it. Amen. Amen.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; The song is titled I have victory.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[2:24:43] Mech and
[2:24:49] a story of victory.
[2:24:53] Victory in itself.
[2:24:58] He showed himself my dear.
[2:25:02] As the fourth man in the fire,
[2:25:06] there is victory
[2:25:10] in the Lord.
[2:25:15] When Daniel
[2:25:17] was Daniel, born in the lion's den,
[2:25:24] having sweet fellowship
[2:25:27] instead of judgment,
[2:25:32] a reminder of God's faithfulness
[2:25:36] that he will bring you out.
[2:25:40] There is victory
[2:25:44] in the Lord.
[2:25:49] There is victory.
[2:25:53] So much victory
[2:25:57] in the lamb of Calvary.
[2:26:02] are crucified.

[2:26:08] daily.
[2:26:10] I'm part in his wings. I have victory

[2:26:22] David the chosen,
[2:26:26] anointed of God,
[2:26:30] trained as a shaper
[2:26:34] and warrior in battle.
[2:26:39] And so as he walking

[2:31:12] song is by brother Joshua
[2:31:17] sorry brother Mesa
[2:31:19] and uh it is titled destiny choices.
[2:31:23] So he picks his inspiration
[2:31:26] from the message the choosing of the
[2:31:29] bride 1965
[2:31:32] from paragraph 31.
[2:31:35] Amen. So as the brother steps up,
[2:31:40] let me take Oh,
[2:31:47] you're going
[2:32:11] God bless you.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; I'm quoting from the choosing of a bride
[2:32:16] paragraph 31.
[2:32:20] In many things of life, we are given a
[2:32:23] choice. The way of life itself is a
[2:32:27] choice. We have a right to make our own
[2:32:30] way, choose our own way that we want to
[2:32:33] live.
[2:32:37] Right and wrong is a choice. Every man,
[2:32:41] every woman, boy and girl has to has to
[2:32:45] choose whether they are going to try to
[2:32:47] live right or not to live right. It's a
[2:32:50] choice.
[2:32:52] Choice is a great thing. Your eternal
[2:32:56] destination is a choice.
[2:32:58] And maybe tonight some of you will make
[2:33:00] that choice of where you will spend
[2:33:03] eternity. Before this service ends,
[2:33:07] there will be one time that if you turn
[2:33:09] if you turned God down many times, there
[2:33:12] will be one time you turn him down the
[2:33:15] last time. There is a line between mercy
[2:33:18] and judgment. And it's danger. It's a
[2:33:21] dangerous thing for a man or woman, boy
[2:33:23] or girl, to step across that line.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; For there is no return when you step
[2:33:29] across that line. So tonight, it may be
[2:33:33] the time that many will make their
[2:33:35] decision where they will spend their
[2:33:38] endless eternity.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; God
[2:34:02] We are given
[2:34:04] a choice to live or to die.
[2:34:12] to follow the path that leads to the
[2:34:16] sky.
[2:34:20] Oh, to wonder in darkness
[2:34:24] without the light.
[2:34:28] The decision is ours. They
[2:34:33] are none.
[2:34:37] In many things of life we are given
[2:34:44] a choice.
[2:34:46] The way of life itself
[2:34:50] is a choice.
[2:34:54] We have a right to choose life for all
[2:34:59] day.
[2:35:02] have a right to choose heaven or hell.
[2:35:10] Choose life. Choose love. Choose the way
[2:35:16] that leads to life.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus is the way, the truth and life.
[2:35:26] Oh, before you stand right and wrong,
[2:35:30] they unaware of Satan's way. The choice
[2:35:35] is yours to make. Decide tonight.
[2:35:42] Choose love. Choose love. Choose the
[2:35:47] way. There is no
[2:35:50] Jesus is the way, the truth, and life.
[2:35:58] Before you stand right and wrong,
[2:36:02] eternal
[2:36:04] sat.
[2:36:05] Oh, the choice is yours to make his eyes
[2:36:09] tonight.
[2:36:13] God made us free moral agents in life to
[2:36:19] choose
[2:36:21] between the good and bad like in for
[2:36:26] Adam and Eve.
[2:36:29] He say that the tree of knowledge
[2:36:33] or the tree of life to choose
[2:36:37] and the choice they made affected the
[2:36:41] human race.
[2:36:46] God made us free moral agency in life to
[2:36:52] choose
[2:36:54] between the good and bad like he made
[2:36:59] for Adam and Eve.
[2:37:02] and say that the tree of knowledge
[2:37:06] or the tree of life to choose
[2:37:10] and the choice they made affected the
[2:37:13] human race.
[2:37:18] Choose life, choose love, choose the way
[2:37:24] that your life Jesus is the way, the
[2:37:29] truth and life. Before
[2:37:34] you stand right and wrong, it's unaware
[2:37:39] of Satan's way. For a choice is yours to
[2:37:44] make. Decide tonight.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; Choose life. Choose life. Choose the way
[2:37:55] that life. Oh, Jesus is that way. The
[2:38:00] truth and life.
[2:38:04] Oh, before you stand, right and wrong,
[2:38:09] etc.
[2:38:13] is yours to make. Besides tonight,
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; etc.
[2:38:29] tonight.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; You have a choice to make. Amen.
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; So, let's have our sister Meda with
[2:38:47] trust in you.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; She picks her inspiration from Psalms
[2:38:53] and Pastor Martin is going to take us
[2:38:55] through the inspiration.
[2:39:02] God bless you.
[2:39:05] &gt;&gt; Psalms
[2:39:07] chapter 25 1-10.
[2:39:10] Unto thee, oh Lord, do I lift up my
[2:39:13] soul. Oh my God, I trust in thee. Let me
[2:39:17] not be ashamed. Let not mine enemies
[2:39:20] triumph over me. Yeah. Let none that
[2:39:24] wait on thee be ashamed. Let them be
[2:39:28] ashamed which transgress without cause.
[2:39:32] Show me thy ways, oh Lord. Teach me thy
[2:39:36] path. Lead me in thy truth and teach me,
[2:39:39] for thou art the God of my salvation. On
[2:39:43] thee do I wait all the day. Remember, O
[2:39:46] Lord, thy tender mercies and thy loving
[2:39:50] kindness, for they have been ever of
[2:39:54] old. Remember not the sins of my youth,
[2:39:58] nor my transgressions. According to thy
[2:40:01] mercy, remember thou me for thy goodness
[2:40:04] sake, O Lord. Good and upright is the
[2:40:08] Lord.
[2:40:09] Therefore will he teach sinners in the
[2:40:13] way.
[2:40:15] The meek will he guide in judgment, and
[2:40:19] the meek will he teach in his way. All
[2:40:22] the paths of the Lord are mercy and
[2:40:25] truth and such as keep his covenant and

[3:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:32:54] So, let's have sister Karen
[3:32:57] with the with the voice of the Lord.
[3:33:01] She picks her inspiration
[3:33:03] from the message, the voice of God in
[3:33:07] these last days. In these last days,
[3:33:10] &gt;&gt; paragraph 105.
[3:33:13] It reads, "Closing, I may say this.
[3:33:17] There was a man one time who was a
[3:33:20] believer. He had been dead four days. He
[3:33:24] was in the grave stinking, rotten, but
[3:33:28] heard the voice of God speak. Lazarus,
[3:33:32] come forth." And if if it brought a man
[3:33:36] forth after being dead and rotten, what
[3:33:40] ought it to do to a church that still
[3:33:42] has life in it?
[3:33:45] It ought resurrect them in the mess of
[3:33:48] all of these voices that we've talked
[3:33:51] about, religious, politics, Hollywood,
[3:33:54] all the false prophecies and things
[3:33:56] that's gone out. In the midst of all of
[3:34:00] all of it, the true voice of God will
[3:34:03] call a man that is dead in sin and
[3:34:06] trespasses to life again. It ought to
[3:34:09] take a basian church and call it to life
[3:34:12] again. Sure. Amen. God bless you.
[3:34:25] God bless you.
[3:34:36] We hear many
[3:34:44] but Lord
[3:34:46] we
[3:34:48] for
[3:34:49] your voice
[3:34:52] give us the strength
[3:34:55] to
[3:34:59] And lords of our hearts
[3:35:03] to obey
[3:35:05] because
[3:35:09] it's
[3:35:12] geny.
[3:35:16] It's set the table
[3:35:21] please.
[3:35:24] It can raise the dry bones, heal the
[3:35:31] sin, and renew our soul.
[3:35:41] You receive
[3:35:47] it
[3:35:49] the day of flee.
[3:35:55] Each time
[3:35:57] the dry bones heal the sink and renew a
[3:36:05] sing
[3:36:10] it can purify
[3:36:14] shify.
[3:36:18] It's
[3:36:20] all
[3:36:22] glory.
[3:36:25] Oh, it can raise the dry bones until he
[3:36:40] can.
[3:36:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, it can.
[3:36:45] It can.
[3:36:48] Oh, it can send.
[3:36:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, it can.
[3:37:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, it
[3:37:08] renew.
[3:37:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, it can.
[3:37:17] chase and divide.
[3:37:21] It can save the
[3:37:25] holy.
[3:37:29] It can raise the dry bones. Heal the sea
[3:37:37] and renew our sins. Sing.
[3:37:45] Oh, we hear
[3:37:48] many voice
[3:37:52] this day.
[3:37:55] But Lord
[3:37:57] are with us.
[3:37:59] Oh, for
[3:38:01] your voice.
[3:38:04] Give us a strength
[3:38:08] to be
[3:38:12] and Lord soften our hearts
[3:38:16] to obey
[3:38:18] because
[3:38:22] it can purify
[3:38:26] genify
[3:38:30] it.
[3:38:35] Going
[3:38:39] it
[3:38:41] the trial
[3:38:46] the sin and renew
[3:38:50] our
[3:38:53] You read my chlor.
[3:39:04] can be holy
[3:39:11] Praise the trials
[3:39:19] and renew
[3:39:21] our sing.
[3:39:33] Amen.
[3:39:37] Amen. That voice
[3:39:41] It can heal the sick.
[3:39:44] It can save every sinner. Amen.
[3:39:47] So we have
[3:39:49] Lel G and L G with a song. Oh Jesus,
[3:39:55] what a lovely friend you are.

[3:42:11] friend you are.
[3:42:15] Such grace and love and know.
[3:42:21] You have done me very well.
[3:42:27] The moment I wake up
[3:42:30] and see the sun,
[3:42:33] I'm reminded of the love you have for
[3:42:37] me.
[3:42:39] When I hear the birds sing
[3:42:42] in the trees,
[3:42:45] I know that all creation sings your
[3:42:49] praise.
[3:42:51] Oh Jesus,
[3:42:53] Jesus, Jesus.
[3:42:57] Oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[3:43:02] what a lovely
[3:43:05] friend you are.
[3:43:08] Such grace and love and know.
[3:43:14] You have done me very well.
[3:43:20] In moments of triumph
[3:43:23] that I face,
[3:43:26] I remember that you died because of
[3:43:30] love.
[3:43:31] So I'll take this moment
[3:43:35] and every day
[3:43:38] to live my life in worship to you, Lord.
[3:43:44] Oh Jesus,
[3:43:46] Jesus, Jesus.
[3:43:50] Oh Jesus,
[3:43:52] Jesus, Jesus.
[3:43:55] What a lovely
[3:43:57] friend you are.
[3:44:01] Such grace and love and know.
[3:44:07] You have done me very well.
[3:44:13] Oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[3:44:19] Oh Jesus, Jesus,
[3:44:22] Jesus.
[3:44:24] What a lovely friend you are.
[3:44:30] Such grace and love and know.
[3:44:36] You have done me very well.
[3:44:42] What a lovely friend you are.

[3:45:12] Amen. He has grace and his grace and
[3:45:15] love is such unknown. Amen.
[3:45:17] &gt;&gt; So, thank you so much for the song.
[3:45:19] Let's have sister Faith King with still
[3:45:24] our trust in you. She draws her
[3:45:26] inspiration from a number of books.
[3:45:29] James chapter 1 verse 23, Romans 8:28,
[3:45:35] Proverbs 3:11-2,
[3:45:38] and then a sermon, a message that was
[3:45:41] preached by brother Tim Dodd entitled
[3:45:46] human spirit. So we shall simply pick
[3:45:49] out an extract of that sermon uh and we
[3:45:53] shall listen it where she picks her
[3:45:55] inspiration. May God bless you.
[3:46:09] The last one comes in.
[3:46:11] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take very long.
[3:46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:46:28] Amen.
[3:46:29] &gt;&gt; You know him.
[3:46:31] &gt;&gt; He was that man
[3:46:33] that was hanging at the cross.
[3:46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:46:38] &gt;&gt; There was a man, how do you call him?
[3:46:41] We call him the sheer.
[3:46:44] There's that man that was hanging at the
[3:46:45] cross
[3:46:47] with Jesus together.
[3:46:50] Is that right? With Jesus together.
[3:46:53] There was someone hanging with him.
[3:46:56] and one.
[3:46:58] &gt;&gt; Hey
[3:47:30] It's okay. It's okay.
[3:47:53] It's all for a purpose.
[3:48:25] The Bible says resist not the evil
[3:48:31] evil with good.
[3:48:35] Hallelujah.
[3:48:37] &gt;&gt; When something bad happens to you,
[3:48:41] just raise your hand.
[3:48:44] Lord, I don't understand.
[3:48:47] You have a purpose in this.
[3:48:50] I'm not backing up.
[3:48:52] I'm moving forward.
[3:48:55] God has a rapture.
[3:48:58] God has a body change.
[3:49:05] God has a bride
[3:49:08] that overcometh
[3:49:10] will I grant you sit with me.
[3:49:18] Hallelujah.
[3:49:36] Lord, I wasn't there
[3:49:44] when you met up with the tempter
[3:49:52] and said, "Have you seen my serant?
[3:50:00] and set me to the test.
[3:50:07] Oh,
[3:50:09] all I see is pain
[3:50:16] as my word crumbles down.
[3:50:24] And they whisper, "You can't make it.
[3:50:33] Just cast Gordon D.
[3:50:40] I may not understand
[3:50:48] when you hand me to the tempter.
[3:50:56] When I'm walking through the fire.
[3:51:04] Oh, drowning in life scares.
[3:51:12] I may not understand.
[3:51:19] when you take the ones I love.
[3:51:27] But Lord, even when you slay me,
[3:51:35] still I trust you.
[3:51:42] &gt;&gt; I really didn't know.
[3:51:49] that you are testing my faith
[3:51:57] when you said take your only son
[3:52:04] and give him for a sacrifice.
[3:52:10] Lord,
[3:52:12] how could I understand
[3:52:19] that you only sought obedience
[3:52:26] and with God's provided way,
[3:52:34] he gave a lamb for sacrifice.
[3:52:40] Oh, I may not understand
[3:52:48] when you hand me to the tempter.
[3:52:55] When I'm walking through the fire.
[3:53:03] Oh, drowning in life scares.
[3:53:09] Lord, I may not understand
[3:53:17] when you take the ones I love.
[3:53:24] But Lord, even when you slay me,
[3:53:32] still will I trust you.
[3:53:39] Joseph was betrayed
[3:53:45] by the ones who should have loved him
[3:53:49] most.
[3:53:52] and Hosea had to your
[3:53:59] to someone deemed unworthy.
[3:54:06] No, they didn't understand
[3:54:14] the purpose of their heartache.
[3:54:20] Their lives were just a small time
[3:54:27] of your redeeming love.
[3:54:34] Lord, I may not understand
[3:54:41] when you hand me to the temper.
[3:54:48] When I'm walking through the fire.
[3:54:55] Oh, drowning in life scares.
[3:55:01] Oh, I may not understand.
[3:55:07] Oh,
[3:55:09] and you take the ones I love.
[3:55:16] Lord, even when you slay me,
[3:55:23] still will I trust you.
[3:55:30] I face Goliath down.
[3:55:36] I went in the name of Jesus.
[3:55:42] Oh, in the den of hungry lions,
[3:55:50] I saw your perfect love.
[3:55:57] And when I face the fire,
[3:56:04] I'm sure
[3:56:06] of your will.
[3:56:10] There was a fourth man in the fire
[3:56:17] and he delivered me again.
[3:56:23] Lord, I may not understand.
[3:56:29] I may not see it
[3:56:32] to the temp. Oh, and I'm walking through
[3:56:38] the fire.
[3:56:39] &gt;&gt; Through the fire.
[3:56:41] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[3:56:42] Lord, when I'm drowning,
[3:56:45] &gt;&gt; drowning in life,
[3:56:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, I may not understand it. Oh,
[3:56:52] &gt;&gt; I may not understand.
[3:56:54] &gt;&gt; I may not understand.
[3:56:59] When you take the ones I love,
[3:57:03] &gt;&gt; when you pay me, Lord,
[3:57:06] &gt;&gt; even when you slay me.
[3:57:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, still will I trust you.
[3:57:13] &gt;&gt; Still will I trust you.
[3:57:17] Oh,
[3:57:19] I may not understand
[3:57:26] when you hand me to the temple.
[3:57:34] &gt;&gt; When I'm walking through the fire.
[3:57:44] Oh, drowning in life.
[3:57:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, I may not understand it.
[3:57:53] &gt;&gt; I may not understand.
[3:57:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I may not understand it. Oh Lord,
[3:58:02] &gt;&gt; when you take the ones I love,
[3:58:07] &gt;&gt; but I know that it's working for my
[3:58:11] girl.
[3:58:14] Oh Lord, it's working for my good.
[3:58:21] Still will I trust you.
[3:58:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:58:34] &gt;&gt; I may not understand when you hand me
[3:58:36] the tempter, but still I'll trust in
[3:58:39] you.
[3:58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58:42] So let's have uh eyes on you by by
[3:58:47] sister OJ Victor Esther
[3:58:50] and she picks her inspiration from
[3:58:53] Matthew 14 and uh brother Martin will
[3:58:56] read that scripture
[3:59:09] Matthew
[3:59:11] 28-31
[3:59:15] and Peter answered him and said, "Lord,
[3:59:20] if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on
[3:59:24] the water."
[3:59:26] And he said, "Come." And when Peter was
[3:59:29] come down out of the ship, he walked on
[3:59:32] the water to go to Jesus.
[3:59:36] But when he saw the wind boisterous, he
[3:59:39] was afraid. And beginning to sink, he
[3:59:43] cried, saying, "Lord, save me." And
[3:59:47] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[3:59:50] hand, and caught him, and said unto him,
[3:59:54] "Oh, thou of little faith, wherefore did
[3:59:58] thou doubt?" God bless you.
[4:00:13] Help
[4:00:22] me
[4:00:28] when I'm sinking. Help me keep my eyes
[4:00:32] on you.
[4:00:36] When my faith is winging,
[4:00:40] when I can't keep on standing,
[4:00:44] scared by waves, you reach your hand to
[4:00:47] me.
[4:00:51] So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Even when
[4:00:55] the storm is out, you're the anchor that
[4:01:00] I cling to when my fears are pulling me
[4:01:04] down.
[4:01:05] You're the only one who says the only
[4:01:09] truth that never fades.
[4:01:13] So keep my eyes on you, Lord.
[4:01:16] Keep my eyes on you.
[4:01:20] Keep my eyes on you, Lord. Even when the
[4:01:24] storm is loud,
[4:01:27] you're the anchor that I cling to when
[4:01:30] my faith are pulling me down.
[4:01:34] You're the only one who says, the only
[4:01:38] truth that never fades.
[4:01:41] So keep my eyes on you, Lord.
[4:01:45] Keep my eyes on you.
[4:01:50] When the work of the walls felt
[4:01:52] impossible and high.
[4:01:56] When I was mocked for listening when you
[4:02:04] when they laughed and spoke against him
[4:02:07] tried to check his heart and spirit knew
[4:02:11] his eyes were fixed and he kept building
[4:02:14] through it all.
[4:02:18] So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Even when
[4:02:22] the storm is loud. You're the anchor
[4:02:26] that I cling to. When my face are
[4:02:30] pulling me down.
[4:02:32] You're the only one who says, the only
[4:02:36] truth that never fad.
[4:02:39] So keep my eyes on you, Lord.
[4:02:43] Keep my eyes on you.
[4:02:48] When the fire was lit and the king gave
[4:02:51] his command,
[4:02:54] when the three children refused to bow
[4:02:58] and no
[4:03:02] even in the flames they trusted a forth
[4:03:06] came and walked alone, you did not
[4:03:09] disappoint. The eyes never turned away.
[4:03:16] So keep my eyes on you, Lord. Even when
[4:03:20] the storm is loud. You're the anchor
[4:03:24] that I cling to. When my fears are
[4:03:27] pulling me down,
[4:03:29] you're the only one who says, the only
[4:03:33] truth I never fail.
[4:03:36] So keep my eyes on you, Lord.
[4:03:40] Keep my eyes on you.
[4:03:44] Keep my eyes on you, Lord. Even when the
[4:03:48] storm is loud. You're the anchor that I
[4:03:52] came to. When my fears are pulling me
[4:03:56] down, you're the only one who says, the
[4:04:00] only truth that never fades.
[4:04:04] So keep my eyes on you, Lord.
[4:04:08] Keep my eyes on you.
[4:04:13] You're the only one who saves,
[4:04:16] &gt;&gt; the only truth that never fails.
[4:04:21] So keep my eyes on you, Lord.
[4:04:27] Keep my eyes on you.
[4:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:04:36] Keep my eyes on you. That's everyone's
[4:04:39] prayer
[4:04:40] &gt;&gt; that the Lord may keep our eyes on him.
[4:04:43] Amen.
[4:04:44] &gt;&gt; In the regs of troubles, let him keep
[4:04:48] our eyes on him. Amen. So, let's have uh
[4:04:52] sister Karen with I believe
[4:04:56] and she picks in from Hebrews and Mark
[4:05:00] and I'll invite brother Silas to come
[4:05:03] and read out her inspiration. Amen.
[4:05:16] Hebrews 11 verse 6.
[4:05:22] But without faith it is impossible to
[4:05:25] please God, to please him.
[4:05:29] For he that cometh to God must believe
[4:05:31] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[4:05:36] them that diligently seek him.
[4:05:39] Then Mark 9 supposed to read from 17 to
[4:05:42] 24 but uh we skipped Psalm. There was a
[4:05:46] man who brought his child to Jesus who
[4:05:48] was suffering from an evil spirit. And
[4:05:51] we'll read the last two verses.
[4:05:54] Jesus said unto him, "If thou canst
[4:05:57] believe, all things are possible to him
[4:05:59] that believeth."
[4:06:01] &gt;&gt; And straightway the father of the child
[4:06:03] cried out and said with tears, "Lord, I
[4:06:08] believe, help thou my unbelief.
[4:06:34] God bless you.
[4:07:05] My heart is full
[4:07:09] of uncertainty.
[4:07:13] And all I see
[4:07:16] is h.
[4:07:20] But I know
[4:07:24] that you care for me.
[4:07:27] So dear Lord
[4:07:30] save
[4:07:32] me.
[4:07:34] I believe.
[4:07:37] Lord, I believe.
[4:07:41] Please help my
[4:07:45] belie.
[4:07:49] Check my heart,
[4:07:52] Lord. Check my heart
[4:07:56] and remove
[4:07:58] any
[4:08:00] doubt.
[4:08:04] I believe,
[4:08:06] Lord, I believe.
[4:08:10] Please help my eyes believe.
[4:08:17] Oh, shake my heart.
[4:08:21] Lord, shake my heart
[4:08:24] and remove
[4:08:27] any
[4:08:29] doubt.
[4:08:31] I'm sinking in
[4:08:35] the deep ocean.
[4:08:38] You never make it
[4:08:42] is all I hear.
[4:08:46] Oh my Lord.
[4:08:49] I know you're standing by.

[4:09:40] believe.
[4:09:44] &gt;&gt; Shake my heart, Lord. Lord, shake my
[4:09:48] hands for the glory. Glory, glory,
[4:09:53] glory, holy God.
[4:09:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sinking in
[4:10:01] that deep portion of it. You never make
[4:10:07] it
[4:10:08] is all I hear.
[4:10:12] Oh my Lord,
[4:10:15] I know you're standing by.
[4:10:19] Stretch your hand
[4:10:22] out to me.
[4:10:28] I believe,
[4:10:30] Lord, I believe.

[4:11:04] Help my heart
[4:11:07] believe.
[4:11:11] Shake my heart,
[4:11:14] Lord. Shake my heart
[4:11:19] and remove
[4:11:22] any
[4:11:24] doubt.
[4:11:28] Oh, I believe
[4:11:32] Lord, I believe.
[4:11:37] Please remove
[4:11:41] any
[4:11:43] doubt.
[4:11:54] Amen.
[4:11:56] I believe and God says I know. Amen. So
[4:12:01] I believe from Sister Karen.
[4:12:05] And the next song
[4:12:46] baby with parental care. But God said
[4:12:50] that his love was elective love. The
[4:12:53] proof of his love is election. And no
[4:12:57] matter what happened, his love was
[4:12:59] proven truly by the fact that by the
[4:13:03] fact they were chosen unto salvation.
[4:13:06] Because God has chosen you to salvation
[4:13:08] through sanctification of the spirit and
[4:13:11] belief of the truth. He may commit you
[4:13:15] to death as he did Paul. He may commit
[4:13:17] you to suffering as he did Job. That is
[4:13:21] his prerogative. He is sovereign but it
[4:13:25] is all with a purpose.
[4:13:28] &gt;&gt; Why does he stand by? The reason is in
[4:13:31] Romans 8 chapter 8 verse 17 to 18. And
[4:13:36] if children then hes of God and joint
[4:13:40] hes with Christ if so be that we suffer
[4:13:44] with him that we may also
[4:13:47] glorify together. For I reckon that the
[4:13:50] sufferings of the present time are not
[4:13:54] worthy to be compared with the glory
[4:13:56] which shall be revealed in us. Unless we
[4:13:59] suffer with him, we cannot reign with
[4:14:02] him.
[4:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:14:07] &gt;&gt; God says, "I know."
[4:14:17] And God says, "I know.
[4:14:23] I know
[4:14:25] all that you're going
[4:14:29] through.
[4:14:34] &gt;&gt; My grace to you
[4:14:37] in all
[4:14:39] is sufficient."
[4:14:46] And he says, "I know.
[4:14:51] I know
[4:14:53] it's all working out for good.
[4:15:01] Be still, my child, and know
[4:15:07] that I am God."
[4:15:10] And he says, "I know." When God says, "I
[4:15:15] know."
[4:15:18] Ooh, I know
[4:15:21] all that you're going
[4:15:24] through.
[4:15:25] &gt;&gt; My grace to you in all is sufficient.
[4:15:28] My grace to you in all
[4:15:34] is sufficient.
[4:15:37] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I know."
[4:15:41] when he says I know
[4:15:46] I know
[4:15:48] it's all working out for you. Be still
[4:15:52] my child and know. Oh,
[4:15:56] &gt;&gt; be still my child and know
[4:16:01] that I am love.
[4:16:09] through the body of oppression like
[4:16:13] Joseph.
[4:16:15] He says I know
[4:16:22] &gt;&gt; Shadrach Me ago
[4:16:26] thrown in the fire.
[4:16:29] &gt;&gt; I know.
[4:16:33] Oh,
[4:16:36] he can hold back the plagues and the
[4:16:40] suffering. For Job some came through
[4:16:46] painful moments of trial and humility
[4:16:55] &gt;&gt; through the valley.
[4:16:59] All through the valley of oppression
[4:17:02] like Joseph,
[4:17:05] &gt;&gt; he says, "I know."
[4:17:09] &gt;&gt; He says, "I know." Even when you're in
[4:17:11] the valley of oppression, Shadrach,
[4:17:13] Meak, Abednego
[4:17:16] in the fire.
[4:17:19] &gt;&gt; He doesn't rush even when he knows you
[4:17:21] are in the fire.
[4:17:23] Oh,
[4:17:25] he can hold back the plagues and the
[4:17:29] suffering. But for Job, some came
[4:17:33] through.
[4:17:35] Painful moments of trial and humility.
[4:17:41] God says, "I know."
[4:17:44] &gt;&gt; Friends, God says, "I know." Oh, and God
[4:17:48] says, "I know.
[4:17:52] I know
[4:17:54] all that you're going
[4:17:57] through.
[4:17:58] &gt;&gt; My grace to you.
[4:18:02] &gt;&gt; My grace to
[4:18:04] &gt;&gt; to you.
[4:18:05] &gt;&gt; My grace to you. We know
[4:18:09] sufficient.
[4:18:09] &gt;&gt; His grace is sufficient. No matter the
[4:18:12] circumstance.
[4:18:13] Oh, when he says, "I know."
[4:18:17] Oh, I know. It's all working out for
[4:18:24] good.
[4:18:24] &gt;&gt; Just be still and know that he is God.
[4:18:28] Oh,
[4:18:28] &gt;&gt; be still, my child, and know
[4:18:33] that I am God.
[4:18:38] &gt;&gt; See, God is a God of purpose. Oh, see,
[4:18:42] God is a God
[4:18:45] of purpose.
[4:18:48] lest he would be frustrating
[4:18:52] us. But he has a great plan. Through it
[4:18:56] he unfolds his great plan.
[4:19:00] For his ways
[4:19:03] are higher than ours.
[4:19:07] Oh, he molds me through the darkest
[4:19:11] trials.
[4:19:13] With these good thoughts, my redeemer
[4:19:17] refineses me. Character training,
[4:19:21] character training and molding
[4:19:27] to bring me to an expected end. See God,
[4:19:33] oh see God is our God. hope
[4:19:40] lest he would be frustrating
[4:19:44] us. Oh,
[4:19:47] in it he unfolds his great plans
[4:19:52] for his ways they are higher than us.
[4:19:59] Slowly molds me through the darkest
[4:20:04] trials.
[4:20:06] With these good thoughts, my redeemer
[4:20:10] refineses a character training.
[4:20:14] Character training and holding
[4:20:20] to bring me to an expected end. Can we
[4:20:25] go higher?
[4:20:28] When God says, "I know. I know. I know."
[4:20:35] Oh, God. You're glorying
[4:20:39] and my grace
[4:20:41] to you.
[4:20:43] &gt;&gt; My grace,
[4:20:43] &gt;&gt; my grace to you in all
[4:20:50] the finishes. He says, "I know.
[4:20:56] I know.
[4:20:57] I know.
[4:20:59] &gt;&gt; I know.
[4:21:00] &gt;&gt; I know.
[4:21:01] &gt;&gt; It's all I
[4:21:04] for. Just be still, my child.
[4:21:09] &gt;&gt; Be still.
[4:21:10] &gt;&gt; Be still,
[4:21:10] &gt;&gt; my child.
[4:21:12] &gt;&gt; And know
[4:21:14] that I am God.
[4:21:16] &gt;&gt; I just want to sing with you together.
[4:21:18] Just the drums. God says I know. Come
[4:21:20] on.
[4:21:21] &gt;&gt; God says I know.
[4:21:25] I know.
[4:21:27] all that you're going through.
[4:21:30] &gt;&gt; He knows, brother, sister, he knows what
[4:21:33] you're going through. And my grace to
[4:21:37] you
[4:21:39] in all
[4:21:41] is sufficient.
[4:21:45] He says,
[4:21:47] &gt;&gt; and he says, I know,
[4:21:52] I know
[4:21:54] it's all working out for
[4:21:59] still my child.
[4:22:02] &gt;&gt; He's still my child.
[4:22:05] &gt;&gt; I know
[4:22:07] that I am.
[4:22:09] &gt;&gt; God says, "I know." Just one more time.
[4:22:11] He says, "I know."
[4:22:14] God says, "I know.
[4:22:16] &gt;&gt; I know.
[4:22:18] &gt;&gt; I know
[4:22:21] all that you're going through."
[4:22:25] &gt;&gt; And my grace
[4:22:27] to you.
[4:22:28] &gt;&gt; My grace,
[4:22:30] &gt;&gt; my grace,
[4:22:32] &gt;&gt; you know
[4:22:35] sufficient.
[4:22:37] &gt;&gt; He says, "I know."
[4:22:40] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I know. Oh,
[4:22:45] I know.
[4:22:47] So, I'll be out your

[4:23:40] says, I know. And if God be for us,

[4:23:47] a wonderful sermon. Amen. We notice that
[4:23:50] every one of these songs is a sermon.

[4:23:58] inspirations.

[4:29:51] Sister Faith got the inspiration to
[4:29:54] write the song Redeeming Grace.
[4:29:57] And she also draws her inspiration from
[4:29:59] the message preached by
[4:30:02] uh pastor Andreas.
[4:30:05] The bride has made herself ready.
[4:30:08] &gt;&gt; The bride has made herself ready. Amen.
[4:30:12] &gt;&gt; And so we shall listen to a clip of this
[4:30:15] message and thereafter the sister will

[4:30:24] When the last one comes in,
[4:30:28] when the last one comes in,
[4:30:30] it doesn't take very long.
[4:30:33] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[4:30:35] as we go there a little later,
[4:30:38] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years ago,
[4:30:40] there was already a last one.
[4:30:45] Amen.
[4:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:30:48] &gt;&gt; You know him.
[4:30:50] &gt;&gt; He was that man
[4:30:52] &gt;&gt; that was hanging at the cross.
[4:30:55] Amen.
[4:30:57] &gt;&gt; There was a man. How do you call him?
[4:31:00] We call him the sheh.
[4:31:03] There man that was hanging at the cross
[4:31:06] with Jesus together.
[4:31:09] Is that right? With Jesus together.
[4:31:12] There was someone hanging with him.
[4:31:15] And one said, "Hey, if you are the son
[4:31:19] of God,
[4:31:21] help us do something. Help us from the
[4:31:25] cross. Do it yourself.
[4:31:29] The other one said,
[4:31:31] &gt;&gt; "What?" The other one said, "Hey, he
[4:31:34] deserved our punishment.
[4:31:36] We have done wrong in our life.
[4:31:39] We have deserved our punishment. Has
[4:31:41] done nothing.
[4:31:43] But is it
[4:31:45] all about attitude?"
[4:31:49] And then he is asking.
[4:31:52] &gt;&gt; He's asking
[4:31:53] He's asking can I find grace,
[4:31:57] remember me.
[4:32:00] Remember me when you come into your
[4:32:02] kingdom.
[4:32:04] Jesus turned around. And he said,
[4:32:07] "Today,
[4:32:09] today
[4:32:11] you will be with me
[4:32:13] in paradise."
[4:32:15] Is that right? What did this man do
[4:32:19] &gt;&gt; to go?
[4:32:57] He said there was among you
[4:33:03] when he said my wretched soul.
[4:33:08] Oh, when he left the 99,
[4:33:13] the gentle shepherd was seeking me.
[4:33:20] I am the prodigal
[4:33:24] that he led back home.
[4:33:30] He simply saved me
[4:33:35] because of his love.
[4:33:41] But for the grace of God,
[4:33:46] I would be lost.
[4:33:51] But for the grace of God,
[4:33:56] I'd be the cheapest of sin.
[4:34:02] But for his grace,
[4:34:07] his love and his power.
[4:34:12] All that I am, every breath that I take
[4:34:17] is simply by grace.
[4:34:23] But for the grace of God,
[4:34:28] I would be lost.
[4:34:33] But for the grace of God,
[4:34:38] I'd be the cheapest of s.
[4:34:44] for his grace,
[4:34:49] his love and his power.
[4:34:55] All that I am, every breath that I take
[4:35:00] is simply by grace.
[4:35:05] Grace takes over.
[4:35:10] When love protests,
[4:35:15] there is nothing I could have done
[4:35:21] to deserve his mercy.
[4:35:26] Just be sure that your unbelief.
[4:35:31] Oh, it can't hinder God.
[4:35:37] Just look to the promise. is
[4:35:41] not the way that you feel. It's only by
[4:35:47] grace
[4:35:48] for the grace of God.
[4:35:50] &gt;&gt; But for his grace,
[4:35:53] &gt;&gt; I would be lost.
[4:35:58] But for the grace of God,
[4:36:02] I be the chief that stops s
[4:36:09] for his grace.
[4:36:14] His love and his power.
[4:36:19] All that I am, every breath that I take
[4:36:24] is simply by grace.
[4:36:30] Elective love
[4:36:35] that is my potion.
[4:36:40] Oh, I've caught my rapturing faith
[4:36:45] because he said it is finished.
[4:36:50] Oh yes, I am righteous
[4:36:56] because of his righteousness
[4:37:01] and the right attitude.
[4:37:05] Lord be done to me only by grace
[4:37:15] but for his grace.
[4:37:19] Oh, I want to be so Lord
[4:37:23] &gt;&gt; for the grace of God,
[4:37:25] &gt;&gt; but for his grace,
[4:37:30] &gt;&gt; but for his grad
[4:37:34] for his
[4:37:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, but for his
[4:37:40] power,
[4:37:42] &gt;&gt; all that I am,
[4:37:44] &gt;&gt; all that I am,
[4:37:45] &gt;&gt; all that I am,
[4:37:47] &gt;&gt; that
[4:37:49] is simply by graduate.
[4:38:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my for the grace of God for the
[4:38:06] praise.
[4:38:06] &gt;&gt; We achieve our sing.
[4:38:12] Oh, for your grace, Lord.
[4:38:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you for grace, Lord.
[4:38:21] &gt;&gt; All that I am, all that I am,
[4:38:23] &gt;&gt; all that I am
[4:38:26] simply my
[4:38:30] for his grace,
[4:38:33] his love and his power.
[4:38:37] All that I am, every breath that I take
[4:38:41] is
[4:38:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:38:47] Amen.
[4:38:50] Amen.
[4:38:52] Hallelujah.
[4:38:53] &gt;&gt; For we are a product of grace. Amen.
[4:39:12] And it's by grace that we are all saved.
[4:39:16] &gt;&gt; Without grace, where would we be? It has
[4:39:19] to be grace. Amen.
[4:39:21] &gt;&gt; And because of grace, he says, because
[4:39:25] he said, "It is finished. I am
[4:39:27] righteous."
[4:39:29] Because of his righteousness, the right
[4:39:32] attitude is Lord be it unto me and that
[4:39:36] settles it. Amen.
[4:39:37] &gt;&gt; And so because of his grace, he loves
[4:39:40] you. He loves me. And so the next song
[4:39:43] from Sister Mambbo Faith says you love
[4:39:47] me. Without grace, he would not find me
[4:39:50] and would not love me. Amen. May the
[4:39:52] Lord bless you.
[4:40:48] You have called me by my name. My name
[4:40:51] is inscribed in your palms.
[4:40:54] You embrace me like a little child.
[4:41:02] You say I am yours.
[4:41:05] You say I'm complete.
[4:41:08] You impress me with your love.
[4:41:15] You love me. You
[4:41:19] &gt;&gt; love me.
[4:41:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have called me by my name.
[4:41:25] &gt;&gt; Love me.
[4:41:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have chosen me as your own.
[4:41:32] &gt;&gt; Love me,
[4:41:34] &gt;&gt; Lord. You love me. You
[4:41:38] love me, Lord.
[4:41:42] There is no greater love than this. That
[4:41:46] one would lay down his life and pay it
[4:41:50] all for a friend.
[4:41:56] With an everlasting love says you're the
[4:42:00] upper of my eye,
[4:42:02] my beloved, you are mine.
[4:42:09] You love me. You
[4:42:12] love me, Lord.

[4:42:19] &gt;&gt; love me,
[4:42:20] &gt;&gt; Lord. You have chosen me.
[4:42:26] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[4:42:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, you love me.
[4:42:30] &gt;&gt; You love me, Lord.
[4:42:35] &gt;&gt; You were nailed to the cross. gave your
[4:42:39] life to wretched soul
[4:42:42] all the way to Calvary you went
[4:42:48] with mercy in your eyes
[4:42:52] with grace you looked at me
[4:42:55] and poured out your love
[4:43:01] I love you
[4:43:06] Lord
[4:43:08] cause you fall.
[4:43:12] Oh Lord, I love you.
[4:43:18] Lord, I love
[4:43:23] you.
[4:43:24] Oh yes.
[4:43:30] Oh yes.
[4:43:36] Oh.
[4:43:42] Oh.
[4:43:44] Yes.
[4:44:02] Oh,
[4:44:19] anal.
[4:44:30] Oh, she
[4:44:34] get
[4:44:37] Oh yes.
[4:44:43] Oh yes.
[4:44:55] No one
[4:45:00] guessing.
[4:45:11] Oh yes.
[4:45:17] Oh yeah.
[4:45:24] One full
[4:45:30] time.
[4:45:35] Oh yes.
[4:45:42] Qualing
[4:46:06] is a much.
[4:46:10] Oh yes.
[4:46:16] Oh yes.
[4:46:22] Oh.
[4:46:29] Oh yes.
[4:46:35] Oh yes.
[4:46:40] Wow.
[4:46:53] Oh yes.
[4:47:05] Oh yes.
[4:47:11] Oh yes.
[4:47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:47:32] Amen. He loves you. He loves me. And we
[4:47:36] are here tonight because he loves us.
[4:47:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he called us by his name.
[4:47:43] That's so wonderful. Amen.
[4:47:45] &gt;&gt; So let's have a personal experience.
[4:47:48] A song inspired from first kings chapter
[4:47:52] 10 verse9
[4:47:54] Matthew 16:13-17
[4:47:58] Judges 13 verse 3-5
[4:48:01] Judges 16 17- 21 and chapter 28 verse
[4:48:07] from 28-30
[4:48:10] then Exodus chapter 2 and chapter 3 and
[4:48:14] also from the message the experience
[4:48:18] with and a personal experience with God
[4:48:20] preached 19
[4:48:23] 54
[4:48:25] uh and we shall have brother Sam read
[4:48:28] out a few lines from that message and
[4:48:32] this song was written by sister Ruth
[4:48:38] Oangi
[4:48:40] and I think she'll also be singing it.
[4:48:43] Amen.
[4:49:02] And now Moses had been a bitter failure.
[4:49:06] But out there we see his attention
[4:49:09] attracted to the burning bush. and he
[4:49:12] looks to the burning bush to find out
[4:49:15] what the trouble was and walking close
[4:49:18] to it. Fire usually brings an attraction
[4:49:22] usually the Holy Spirit when it comes in
[4:49:25] a manner of fire attracts the attention
[4:49:28] of the people. And when Moses turned
[4:49:30] aside to consider this burning tree that
[4:49:34] would not burn up, God spoke to him
[4:49:37] aresh a vision by an angel. Now watch
[4:49:41] faith take a hold right quick. The old
[4:49:44] things are passed away. But Moses now
[4:49:46] has a new vision. He has a revelation.
[4:49:50] He has an experience. He had met God. He
[4:49:53] had talked to God. Before that he had
[4:49:56] not met God. He had only read and know
[4:50:00] what his mother had told him by hearing
[4:50:03] what his mother had said and hearing
[4:50:06] what the pastor had said. But now Moses
[4:50:10] has a personal experience. God bless.
[4:50:42] Bless you.
[4:50:44] An angel came to Manua's wife said you
[4:50:49] will bear a son
[4:50:53] from the womb
[4:50:56] deliveries
[4:50:57] will come.
[4:51:00] She kept the vow, raised him right, did
[4:51:04] all she was told.
[4:51:08] But Samson took his gift for granted.
[4:51:11] Training secrets grow
[4:51:15] his love to the let her cut his glory
[4:51:21] down. Light and shade between two
[4:51:25] pillars. It is darkness finally bound.
[4:51:30] And I have peace
[4:51:33] of seding
[4:51:35] what was blessed in me.
[4:51:38] It was once but never caught
[4:51:43] what I was called to be.
[4:51:48] I need a personal experience.
[4:51:52] I need to know it for myself.
[4:51:56] The stories that they told me could
[4:52:00] never be enough.
[4:52:09] It is pain.
[4:52:11] I'm reaching for the
[4:52:15] Lord. I need to know
[4:52:19] you more.
[4:52:28] a basket
[4:52:31] on the river's bed.
[4:52:34] She knew her son was chosen
[4:52:38] but could not see the end.
[4:52:42] He grew up in the palace
[4:52:45] of the wisdom of the land.
[4:52:49] But when he moved without a vision,
[4:52:53] blood was on his hand
[4:52:58] and waiting till a few shiny
[4:53:06] answer.
[4:53:08] It was a time to rise. I've been in my
[4:53:13] own desert wondering far from the cold.
[4:53:19] I've heard they had no
[4:53:23] but that is
[4:53:26] not all.
[4:53:30] I need to find some noise and
[4:53:32] experience.
[4:53:34] I need to know you for myself.
[4:53:38] The stories that they told me could
[4:53:42] never be enough.
[4:53:46] Pick me up the body.
[4:53:49] Like you met him in the days.
[4:53:53] I'm standing on holy ground. But I need
[4:53:58] to meet you.
[4:54:03] Hallelujah.
[4:54:10] &gt;&gt; The stories of the king and all his
[4:54:13] pain,
[4:54:15] but she crossed the desert to go and see
[4:54:20] the gate firsthand.
[4:54:23] She stood before his throne. She said
[4:54:27] the heart was never told. What she
[4:54:30] witnessed for herself
[4:54:34] was one more
[4:54:38] walk beside the master. I didn't teach
[4:54:42] and watch the
[4:54:44] but when he said you are the Christ
[4:54:49] heaven made it real.
[4:54:52] So I'm done with second heart f like a
[4:54:56] queen have come to see
[4:54:59] like little go revelation
[4:55:03] father but I speak
[4:55:06] to me
[4:55:10] I need a
[4:55:12] spirit I need to know you for myself
[4:55:17] the stories they told me. You never be
[4:55:23] enough.
[4:55:25] Leave me in the secret place. Reveal
[4:55:29] yourself to me. I'm a living de.
[4:55:46] Give me a pass and not experience.
[4:55:50] I want to know you for myself.
[4:55:53] Not my mama's present. Lord, I need you
[4:55:57] to reveal yourself.
[4:56:01] Beats me in my midnight hour like sun in
[4:56:06] his sh
[4:56:09] from my eyes. Lord, I need to know
[4:56:15] you more.
[4:56:22] I just need to know
[4:56:26] you more.
[4:56:33] &gt;&gt; I just need to know
[4:56:37] you more.
[4:56:44] Give me a personal experience
[4:56:51] with you.
[4:56:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:57:06] Amen.
[4:57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a sermon.
[4:57:13] &gt;&gt; The preachers have preached, the
[4:57:15] teachers have taught, but each one of us
[4:57:18] needs to have a personal experience.
[4:57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not what the preachers preached,
[4:57:25] but you need to find your own a personal
[4:57:29] experience with Christ.
[4:57:30] &gt;&gt; That's all that matters. Amen.
[4:57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are so blessed. Are you
[4:57:36] blessed?
[4:57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am so blessed to be in his
[4:57:39] presence. Amen. So, let's have another
[4:57:43] song. We just have a few songs remaining
[4:57:47] around two or three
[4:57:50] to close the session.
[4:57:53] So, we have the next song,
[4:57:55] The Crimson Ribbon.
[4:57:58] And sister faith
[4:58:01] wrote this song and she got the
[4:58:03] inspiration from the message that pastor
[4:58:07] I preached
[4:58:09] last week
[4:58:12] the world that Jesus died for. And so we
[4:58:16] shall have an extract
[4:58:20] of this message
[4:58:23] to get to know her inspiration. So we
[4:58:26] shall have the audio played as we
[4:58:27] listen.
[4:58:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:58:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The sea of glass.
[4:58:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:58:39] &gt;&gt; Is the representation
[4:58:42] of the present altar
[4:58:45] where the sacrifice
[4:58:47] was laid.
[4:58:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:58:50] &gt;&gt; And these people here were standing on
[4:58:53] the sea of glass.
[4:58:55] Thank God for the lamb that was slain.
[4:58:59] Thank God for the lamb that was slain.
[4:59:02] And they glorified God. They sang the
[4:59:05] song of Moses. They sang the song of the
[4:59:07] lamb. They were glorifying God for the
[4:59:11] atonement. What you worship him today?
[4:59:14] What you thank him that you are
[4:59:17] redeemed.
[4:59:19] Who are you to bring yourself in the sea
[4:59:22] of Galile? It is the hand of grace.
[4:59:27] God bless you. God bless you. It's the
[4:59:31] hand of grace that finally brings us at
[4:59:35] the Sea of Galass. Hallelujah. And the
[4:59:39] reflections
[4:59:40] of the greatness of Jehovah being seen
[4:59:44] through you.
[4:59:46] No power, no sir. Not by might, not by
[4:59:51] power, but by strength.
[4:59:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you, brother
[4:59:58] Moses.
[5:00:18] The blood sacrifice of Jesus gave me the
[5:00:23] key.
[5:00:26] When he said, "Behold, I stand and knock
[5:00:30] at the door.
[5:00:34] I opened up my heart." There was an
[5:00:38] invisible
[5:00:40] union
[5:00:41] as the word stepped in and breathed life
[5:00:45] into me.
[5:00:48] So I will hold on to the green sun
[5:00:53] ribbon as Jericho
[5:00:56] crumble.
[5:00:58] Paint the blood over the door. Let the
[5:01:03] death angel pass. I will claim the blood
[5:01:07] of Jesus and redemption for my life. The
[5:01:13] sacrifice
[5:01:15] was given. I am free.
[5:01:21] I'm chosen and elected by
[5:01:24] predestination.
[5:01:29] The seing of life within me is eternal.
[5:01:36] I'm confident in what he promised that
[5:01:40] he will do for me. And when I falter, I
[5:01:46] bring it under the blood.
[5:01:49] So I will hold on to that prince son
[5:01:57] from home.
[5:01:59] May the blood of God adore and let the
[5:02:03] death angel cast. I will claim the blood
[5:02:08] on Jesus and redemption for my life. The
[5:02:13] sacrifice
[5:02:15] was given. I am free.
[5:02:21] He didn't save me today to lose me
[5:02:25] tomorrow.
[5:02:28] And I know that my salvation is of the
[5:02:32] Lord.
[5:02:35] I'll feed upon the word to quicken my
[5:02:40] rapuring faith
[5:02:43] is taught by might by the spirit and the
[5:02:47] blood.
[5:02:49] I will hold on to the green stars
[5:02:53] relevant
[5:03:02] death angel pass. I will claim the blood
[5:03:06] of Jesus and repent for my life.
[5:03:10] Sacrifice
[5:03:11] receive and I are free. I want to honor
[5:03:18] Jerry was crumb
[5:03:24] and let the death angel pass. I will
[5:03:28] claim the blood on Jesus as redemption.
[5:03:32] All my life is sacrifice.
[5:03:42] Even I am free.
[5:03:46] &gt;&gt; I will hold on to the green river.
[5:03:51] Jericho
[5:03:53] crumble.
[5:03:55] May the blood of adore. Let the death
[5:04:00] show pass. I will claim the blood of
[5:04:03] Jesus and redemption for my life. The
[5:04:08] sacrifice
[5:04:10] was given. I am free.
[5:04:15] The sacrifice
[5:04:17] was given. I am free.
[5:04:25] I am.
[5:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:04:31] And the sacrifice was given and I am
[5:04:33] free.
[5:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Chosen and elected by
[5:04:38] predestination.
[5:04:40] Not because you wanted to be but because
[5:04:43] he chose you to be.
[5:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the next is body change
[5:04:50] from brother Joshua
[5:04:53] and
[5:04:56] he was inspired
[5:04:59] from the book of 1 Corinthians
[5:05:02] chapter 15 verse 51 and 55
[5:05:05] and 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1-4
[5:05:10] and a few more other scriptures but I'll
[5:05:12] read out 1 Corinthians 15 verse 51
[5:05:18] to 55. The song is titled body change.
[5:05:23] Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall
[5:05:27] not all sleep, but we shall we shall all
[5:05:31] be changed in a moment, in the twinkling
[5:05:34] of an eye, at the last trump. For the
[5:05:38] trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
[5:05:40] be raised incorruptible, and we shall be
[5:05:44] changed. For this corruptible must put
[5:05:47] on incorruption, and this moto must put
[5:05:51] on immortality. So when this corruptible
[5:05:55] shall have put on incorruption, and this
[5:05:57] moto shall have put on immortality, then
[5:06:01] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[5:06:04] is written, death is swallowed up in
[5:06:08] victory. Oh death, where is thy string?
[5:06:13] Oh grave, where is thy victory? We shall
[5:06:17] be changed.
[5:06:42] How I long
[5:06:47] to be clothed
[5:06:52] clothed upon
[5:06:56] with mighty
[5:06:58] of my knee.
[5:07:02] How I long
[5:07:07] to be changed.
[5:07:11] Oh yes. From this mortal
[5:07:16] to evil.
[5:07:20] How I long,
[5:07:22] how I long
[5:07:27] to be clothed, float upon,
[5:07:32] flow upon
[5:07:36] with mighty.
[5:07:40] How I long,
[5:07:43] how I long
[5:07:48] to be changed.
[5:07:51] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. From this mortal
[5:07:56] to immortality.
[5:08:04] Someday
[5:08:06] this vessel of earth will dissolve.
[5:08:13] into a glorious
[5:08:16] building that never dies.
[5:08:23] There are so many cracks
[5:08:26] and pests that infest this house.
[5:08:33] I long to change
[5:08:36] my dwelling place from here.
[5:08:41] How I long,
[5:08:43] how I long
[5:08:48] to be
[5:08:52] the poor,
[5:08:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, the
[5:08:57] &gt;&gt; with my
[5:09:00] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, how I long,
[5:09:03] &gt;&gt; how I long
[5:09:08] to be changed.
[5:09:11] Oh yes. From this portal
[5:09:16] to immortality.
[5:09:23] Behold
[5:09:26] now so plain. This is the mystery.
[5:09:33] Be that alive.
[5:09:36] Want to sleep but be chained.
[5:09:43] Now being quickened
[5:09:46] by rapturing faith in the word
[5:09:53] will be translated
[5:09:56] to meet loved ones and cry. Behold now
[5:10:01] so plain.
[5:10:03] Behold
[5:10:05] now so plain.
[5:10:08] This is the mystery. Paul tells us a
[5:10:11] mystery without a lie.
[5:10:15] Won't all sleep
[5:10:18] but we'll be changed.
[5:10:22] We are now being weakened
[5:10:26] by rapturing faith in the word. Faith in
[5:10:31] the word that is preached will be
[5:10:34] translated
[5:10:36] and we'll meet our loved ones in Christ.
[5:10:40] Oh, how I long,
[5:10:43] how I long
[5:10:48] to be clothed. I want to be clothed,
[5:10:51] Lord.
[5:10:55] Let my Theophony speak to me every day.
[5:11:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I Lord,
[5:11:03] &gt;&gt; how I
[5:11:08] &gt;&gt; to be changed
[5:11:11] &gt;&gt; from this mortal. From this water
[5:11:14] &gt;&gt; from this mortal
[5:11:16] &gt;&gt; to give immortality.
[5:11:20] &gt;&gt; How I long
[5:11:23] &gt;&gt; How I long
[5:11:28] to be clothed
[5:11:31] &gt;&gt; clothe the
[5:11:37] mighty.
[5:11:41] How I long,
[5:11:44] &gt;&gt; how I long
[5:11:49] to be
[5:11:52] &gt;&gt; from this home.
[5:11:55] &gt;&gt; From this.
[5:11:57] &gt;&gt; Just sing it with me everyone.
[5:12:00] &gt;&gt; How I long.
[5:12:02] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[5:12:03] I
[5:12:06] alone.
[5:12:08] alone
[5:12:10] to be clothed.
[5:12:13] &gt;&gt; Clothe.
[5:12:19] &gt;&gt; I want my body to glow me. Oh, I know.
[5:12:26] &gt;&gt; How I know I know
[5:12:31] &gt;&gt; to be changed
[5:12:33] &gt;&gt; from this mortal. Proise mortal
[5:12:39] to immortality.
[5:12:44] &gt;&gt; Promise mot
[5:12:48] &gt;&gt; from this mortal
[5:12:50] &gt;&gt; to be immortal.
[5:12:51] &gt;&gt; I want to be changed from this mortal
[5:12:54] from this mortal
[5:12:57] &gt;&gt; from
[5:12:58] &gt;&gt; as the word is preached every day. May
[5:13:00] it give me rapturing faith.
[5:13:03] Oh J from this bottle
[5:13:07] &gt;&gt; from this portal
[5:13:10] to him.
[5:13:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:13:20] Amen.
[5:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a prayer.
[5:13:26] &gt;&gt; How we all long to be changed.
[5:13:29] And sure the scripture says we shall be
[5:13:32] changed.
[5:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is a sure thing. We shall have
[5:13:36] to be changed.
[5:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:13:41] &gt;&gt; It's been such a wonderful experience.
[5:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:13:46] &gt;&gt; We have been blessed. Amen.
[5:13:55] &gt;&gt; And I trust that
[5:13:58] we shall not go back the same.
[5:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Such a dozen sermons from every
[5:14:06] song. It cannot leave us the same.
[5:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have our last song.
[5:14:16] I was there.
[5:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:14:20] &gt;&gt; The song is I was there.
[5:14:24] &gt;&gt; Were you there?
[5:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this song is one of the very
[5:14:31] first
[5:14:33] songs that we are written original songs
[5:14:36] and uh I'll invite sister Faith to come
[5:14:40] and credit those that sang the song.
[5:14:46] And afterwards,
[5:14:51] hope sister hope the pastor says you
[5:14:54] have to be here.
[5:14:56] You were there.
[5:14:58] So you come and be here.
[5:15:01] Amen. Even sister Pes
[5:15:06] and
[5:15:08] and Pastor Sa.
[5:15:13] So sister faith will create the song
[5:15:15] then pastor I will come
[5:15:18] and take the inspiration of the song.
[5:15:22] Amen. Are you blessed?
[5:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:15:45] God bless you.
[5:15:48] &gt;&gt; I was there
[5:15:50] &gt;&gt; and I've always been there
[5:15:53] &gt;&gt; and that's why I'm here.
[5:15:55] So we thank God for these moments of
[5:15:59] fellowship
[5:16:01] &gt;&gt; having
[5:16:02] worship you know Sundays and one of
[5:16:06] these days we shall need testimony
[5:16:10] Sundays.
[5:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:16:11] &gt;&gt; Where we can get people like brother
[5:16:14] Samson come and tell their story. you
[5:16:18] know why he ends up limping when he was
[5:16:20] born straight and those kind of things
[5:16:24] we may need to hear them. So I certainly
[5:16:27] appreciate God. No I remember one thing
[5:16:31] that up in Matthew 17 on the mount of
[5:16:35] transfiguration
[5:16:37] John Peter and James were taken up
[5:16:41] before the blood was released on Mount
[5:16:44] Calvary.
[5:16:46] And you know Jesus transfigured himself
[5:16:51] from the flesh Jesus to the supernatural
[5:16:54] Christ and then stood by his side.
[5:17:00] Elijah and Moses representing the
[5:17:03] resurrection
[5:17:05] and
[5:17:06] the the rapture. They were up there and
[5:17:10] then John were just being shown a forest
[5:17:14] of what it shall be. So they were
[5:17:17] outside of the ring before Calvary.
[5:17:22] After Calvary, we come to the center of
[5:17:24] the ring.
[5:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:17:27] &gt;&gt; We are not worshiping from the the
[5:17:29] perimeters. We are at the center.
[5:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to say we were there.
[5:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were there. Amen.
[5:17:38] &gt;&gt; Even when the sons of God shouted for
[5:17:41] joy, we were there.
[5:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are not strangers here.
[5:17:46] &gt;&gt; We are here. And today we are in
[5:17:48] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[5:17:52] &gt;&gt; And as brother Joshua singing about the
[5:17:54] theophony, you know, in the heavenly
[5:17:57] places in Christ Jesus where we are
[5:18:00] seated, I want to tell you one thing
[5:18:03] that we are just a thought away from our
[5:18:06] theopanic.
[5:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:18:07] One of these days we shall be changed.
[5:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:18:12] &gt;&gt; So I'll do one thing.
[5:18:14] I
[5:18:16] present the quote where the inspiration
[5:18:20] comes from.
[5:18:22] And this is the message serpent seed of
[5:18:25] 1958 September 28th.
[5:18:29] The prophet says, "I want to ask you,
[5:18:32] who is this?"
[5:18:34] Job 27 all through to 38. When he said,
[5:18:39] "Where was you when I laid the
[5:18:42] foundation of the earth? When the
[5:18:44] morning star sang together and the sons
[5:18:47] of God shouted for joy, who were those
[5:18:50] sons of God that were shouting for joy?"
[5:18:54] Jesus told them that I had joy with you
[5:18:57] before the foundation of the world. We
[5:19:00] are not creatures of time.
[5:19:03] &gt;&gt; We are creatures of eternity.
[5:19:08] &gt;&gt; No man can come to me except my father
[5:19:11] draws him. And all that comes to me,
[5:19:15] I'll give them eternal life and raise
[5:19:18] him upon the last days. No one can pluck
[5:19:22] them from my father's hand.
[5:19:25] &gt;&gt; Who gave them to me? How are you going
[5:19:28] to lose? He's asking how are you going
[5:19:31] to lose? So I was there.
[5:19:35] &gt;&gt; You was there.
[5:19:37] &gt;&gt; That's why we are together meeting in
[5:19:40] fellowship in heavenly places in Christ
[5:19:44] Jesus.
[5:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:19:46] &gt;&gt; If you are there, stand up.
[5:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. and just rejoice as this song is
[5:19:52] being sung and you know shake your
[5:19:55] brother's hand and give a testimony. I
[5:19:57] was there.
[5:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was there, brother Wilson.
[5:20:02] I was there. I was there. I was there.
[5:20:06] God bless you.
[5:20:17] &gt;&gt; We are going to use
[5:20:35] Sweet meories
[5:20:40] of glory land.
[5:20:45] What a cross
[5:20:49] my ransom soul.
[5:20:55] And as before,
[5:20:59] ghost I stand
[5:21:05] as
[5:21:08] I do recall.
[5:21:14] I was there.
[5:21:18] Yes, I was there.
[5:21:22] When the sons of God
[5:21:27] together,
[5:21:32] I was there.
[5:21:36] Yes, I was there.
[5:21:41] When the stars are born,
[5:21:46] he shall be joy.
[5:21:52] I am surely
[5:21:55] an angel spirit
[5:21:58] me
[5:22:02] through this world
[5:22:05] to it. Oh
[5:22:09] to the sea.
[5:22:16] I was
[5:22:19] I was
[5:22:29] I was there.
[5:22:32] Yes, I was there.
[5:22:35] When I
[5:22:38] he
[5:22:44] my child s
[5:22:48] my
[5:22:54] Oh my go.
[5:23:00] I came from God.
[5:23:03] Hallelujah is
[5:23:16] to
[5:23:19] I was there.
[5:23:22] Yes, I was there.
[5:23:28] He shall be
[5:23:31] there. I was there.
[5:23:34] Yes, I was there.
[5:23:41] You
[5:23:45] will
[5:23:51] fall.
[5:23:53] We shall rejoice.
[5:23:57] I was
[5:23:59] Yes, I was
[5:24:02] with
[5:24:06] you.
[5:24:09] I was
[5:24:12] Yes, I was
[5:24:17] shall reordall.
[5:24:34] I don't think we should
[5:24:42] stop here.
[5:24:48] I just wait like as we have just
[5:24:50] started.
[5:24:53] I wish we having this all the time. All
[5:24:55] the time. All the time. All the time.
[5:24:58] And every time we have this kind of
[5:25:00] singing, there are new songs that keep
[5:25:01] on coming until you want to repeat them.
[5:25:04] Lay them down.
[5:25:09] There's also another one. I'm told.
[5:25:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So, we want
[5:25:14] to let us clap for them.
[5:25:21] We want to appreciate We want to
[5:25:23] appreciate all of you. I know this
[5:25:26] season has been harder. Last year was
[5:25:29] hard. Last year we almost failed. But
[5:25:32] this day, this time we didn't have faith
[5:25:34] that oh, we didn't have doubt that we
[5:25:35] were going to fail. But again, it was
[5:25:37] harder this year. But nonetheless, we
[5:25:39] want to thank God who has given us the
[5:25:41] grace to be here. It has been
[5:25:44] challenging. And I remember I think it
[5:25:47] was in 2021
[5:25:51] or 22
[5:25:54] when we started our own when we started
[5:25:57] streaming. I think either 2021 or 22 and
[5:26:01] one of the things that compelled us to
[5:26:03] start streaming was you know these kind
[5:26:06] of original songs because many times
[5:26:08] those other previous years where we
[5:26:09] would hire people to come and record
[5:26:12] they don't do good work but you're
[5:26:13] paying them but we thank God that
[5:26:15] everything we sing nowadays is always
[5:26:17] recorded and it's permanent. Praise the
[5:26:20] name of our Lord. So we are so much
[5:26:22] grateful for all the sacrifices.
[5:26:26] Pastors just reminded me that this song
[5:26:28] I was there was sung about 30 years ago.
[5:26:34] Original composition here about 30 years
[5:26:37] ago and that is now in the '9s. There's
[5:26:40] also another song but I'm just
[5:26:43] forgetting. There were quite a number of
[5:26:44] songs.
[5:26:46] The Holy Ghost right now is passing.
[5:26:48] There are other songs nonetheless but
[5:26:50] that was done about 30 years ago and we
[5:26:53] just feel like we shouldn't stop here.
[5:26:57] The way brother work Elijah was saying
[5:26:59] that he got inspiration by seeing what
[5:27:03] has been done here and we appreciate God
[5:27:06] that the gifts keep on multiplying.
[5:27:09] Praise the name of our Lord. There is a
[5:27:11] year we had I think it was over a
[5:27:13] hundred original songs written some time
[5:27:17] but we failed to sing all of them but I
[5:27:20] believe that as we go on the Lord will
[5:27:22] be giving us more grace to keep on
[5:27:24] singing. I want to recognize Mida SA so
[5:27:28] much for the song. I'm happy I saw you
[5:27:29] sing together with Vicky or Joke then
[5:27:33] little Lyel.
[5:27:36] We want to see most of those young gifts
[5:27:38] come up and grow up. Then patients was
[5:27:41] telling me that
[5:27:43] Faith, Ruth and Comfort that they
[5:27:47] started singing when they were 5 years,
[5:27:50] you know, in special singing and they
[5:27:52] are still singing more than 20 years. So
[5:27:54] we appreciate that. Praise the name of
[5:27:57] our Lord. And we just want to encourage
[5:27:59] more and more.
[5:28:01] One thing perhaps which is strange is
[5:28:03] that most of the people stayed here are
[5:28:05] sisters.
[5:28:07] Then I was wondering except the young
[5:28:09] brother behind and when I looked at also
[5:28:12] the Langa team I think there was also
[5:28:16] just a few brothers two or three then I
[5:28:18] looked at the Mayuga team I don't think
[5:28:21] there was a brother there so I'm
[5:28:22] wondering what's happening to the
[5:28:24] brothers
[5:28:27] of course I know some of them on
[5:28:29] equipment there but we need to come up
[5:28:32] praise the name of our Lord let let us
[5:28:34] see that we don't leave it to the
[5:28:36] sisters us alone. Let us be involved
[5:28:39] such that you know we can be able to
[5:28:41] rejoice together for what the Lord has
[5:28:43] done. We want to appreciate you all who
[5:28:45] have been able to come from far and near
[5:28:48] from different places to be part of
[5:28:50] this. We appreciate those who did
[5:28:53] contributions in one or another. We
[5:28:55] appreciate all the sacrifices that have
[5:28:58] been done that we've been able to have
[5:29:00] this day. We always desire to have more
[5:29:02] days but sometimes it becomes
[5:29:04] challenging because some brothers work
[5:29:06] in Campala and some sisters and
[5:29:08] different places. So coming together
[5:29:10] becomes a challenge but we thank God the
[5:29:12] grace that he keeps on giving us. We are
[5:29:15] praying for more grace that we may be
[5:29:17] able to do more and more. Then there's a
[5:29:20] brother who was challenging me. Why
[5:29:22] don't you have these songs produced you
[5:29:24] know like to put them in professional
[5:29:26] production. Now that's a hurdle which we
[5:29:29] still have but we pray that the Lord
[5:29:31] helps us that this music does not end in
[5:29:35] our sosia
[5:29:37] and maybe in our church or on our
[5:29:39] YouTube channel but to see how that it
[5:29:42] can be of help also to other places. So
[5:29:45] thank you so much for all who have come.
[5:29:46] We appreciate you. We the youth so much
[5:29:49] for your sacrifices and time and I pray
[5:29:52] that the Lord blesses you so much. I
[5:29:55] don't know if I'm also to give prayer
[5:29:58] brother. Okay, let us stand up and pray.
[5:30:05] Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[5:30:07] Christ, we thank you for your love,
[5:30:09] grace, and mercy. We thank you for this
[5:30:12] day that you've given us this
[5:30:13] opportunity to come, Lord, and hear all
[5:30:16] these songs that you've inspired our
[5:30:19] brothers and our sisters to write. We
[5:30:21] rejoice together, Father, for the great
[5:30:24] testimonies, the great messages, and the
[5:30:26] things that encourage us and strengthen
[5:30:29] us for the journey that still lays ahead
[5:30:32] of us. Father, we want to give praise
[5:30:34] and honor to your name. You alone are
[5:30:37] worthy of all praise and honor. Lord,
[5:30:39] you alone our holy heavenly father. And
[5:30:42] Lord, Father, this shows that there are
[5:30:44] more things to be done, Lord. And we
[5:30:47] pray therefore Lord you may give us the
[5:30:48] ability to step out Lord into that great
[5:30:53] sphere that Lord you've opened dear God
[5:30:55] and continue heavenly father anointing
[5:30:58] each and everyone using each and
[5:31:00] everyone for the services of the kingdom
[5:31:02] of God. May you bless every gift
[5:31:05] heavenly father and polish it for the
[5:31:07] glor of your holy name Lord. We honestly
[5:31:09] look on you and depend upon you Lord for
[5:31:12] the great things that you do. We love
[5:31:14] you Lord and we thank you father. And
[5:31:16] even as we've come the end of this day
[5:31:17] Lord we pray that father you may grant
[5:31:20] every one of us safe traveling mercies
[5:31:22] as we shall be going back to our places
[5:31:24] of abboard. And bless us again father
[5:31:26] that even these songs we've heard may
