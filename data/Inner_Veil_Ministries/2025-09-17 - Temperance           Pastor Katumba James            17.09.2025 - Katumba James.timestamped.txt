[4:29] A friend of Jesus. Oh, what a bliss that
[4:34] burns over fire.
[4:37] You never have a friend like this to

[4:46] Hallelujah.
[4:48] Friendship
[4:50] Jesus.
[4:53] Yes. Fellowship.
[5:00] Oh, what a blessing communion.
[5:06] Jesus is a friend of mine.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. As pastors come,
[5:12] &gt;&gt; let's let's assure the pastor with this
[5:14] song.
[5:19] I am weak, but thou art strong.
[5:25] Jesus keep me from borrowed

[5:38] [Applause]
[5:40] [Music]
[5:45] Jesus is my king.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Who is my king
[5:52] walking close to me?
[5:57] Let it be.
[5:59] Dear Lord, let it be through this now.
[6:05] through his blood of care
[6:12] in I
[6:15] don't care
[6:19] [Music]
[6:21] with me my care
[6:33] again. Oh
[6:38] with you, Lord.
[6:40] [Music]
[6:44] Jesus is my pleas.

[7:02] They alone.

[7:13] life is all right
[7:21] for me will be no more
[7:37] thy
[7:38] [Music]
[7:40] through
[7:48] walk with me.
[7:51] [Music]
[7:56] Jesus is my
[8:08] Let it be.
[8:12] Let it be.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of our Lord. Just
[8:15] close our Lord. Amen. Let us pray.
[8:17] Father, we thank you for this evening
[8:19] for the grace you've given us, Father,
[8:21] that we can come before your presence.
[8:24] You said where two are gathered in your
[8:26] name, you will be there in their
[8:28] ministry. And Lord, we believe you are
[8:30] here, Lord. We just want a closer walk
[8:32] with you, Lord. You have blessed us this
[8:35] evening father. May you wash us from all
[8:37] unrighteousness.
[8:39] Father you may help us Lordake
[8:42] of your divine nature that we all be
[8:44] changed and be transformed into the
[8:47] image of Jesus Christ.
[8:50] All our prayers Lord
[8:52] all the needs of your children heal the
[8:54] sick in our minist.
[9:09] Amen. I greet in the name of our Lord
[9:12] Jesus Christ. Let us go to second Peter
[9:14] chapter one.
[9:17] Reading from verse 8,
[9:22] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[9:24] &gt;&gt; "Simon Peter, a servant and anost of
[9:26] Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained
[9:29] life, precious faith with through the
[9:31] righteousness of God and our savior
[9:32] Jesus Christ."
[9:46] Sorry,
[9:52] Simon. Simon,
[10:04] grace and peace multiplied unto you
[10:06] through the knowledge of God and of
[10:08] Jesus our Lord.
[10:14] According as his divine power, has given
[10:16] unto us all things that pertain to life
[10:18] and godliness through the knowledge of
[10:20] him that has called us to glory and
[10:22] virtue.
[10:34] Whereby are given unto us
[11:36] like nowadays they are they automatic
[11:38] things or electrical things.
[11:42] He sets maybe the speed
[11:46] of the thing
[11:48] or even the size of the the vessel is
[11:50] going to use
[11:54] the world, you know. Praise the name of
[11:57] the Lord.
[12:02] Praise the name of our Lord. He sets the
[12:04] conditions.
[12:06] He sets the circumstances.
[12:10] Praise the name of our Lord. He knows
[12:13] maybe this one I'm going to pass him
[12:14] through the flood.
[12:17] But it's all molding.
[12:21] He's molding the character.
[12:24] He's mold the nature or his own nature.
[12:27] Then he knows maybe this one I'm going
[12:29] to take him through the fire.
[12:32] This one I'm going to take him through
[12:34] sorrow.
[12:36] This one I'm going to take him to have
[12:37] no job.
[12:40] Sometimes the things we have,
[12:43] they affect the divine nature of God's
[12:46] development in our lives.
[12:50] When the Lord wants you to do this,
[12:54] something along the way,
[12:56] obstructing the work of God,
[12:59] God decides to put it away,
[13:03] his work can come to perfection.
[13:06] Praise the name of our Lord. God is
[13:08] sovereign.
[13:10] He knows where to touch.
[13:13] He knows what button to press.
[13:17] His desire in all these things
[13:20] will bring us into the image of Jesus
[13:22] Christ.
[13:25] So now the Bible says his divine power
[13:30] which he which he has given unto us.
[13:36] Praise the name of our Lord brings us
[13:38] into that life
[13:41] and godliness
[13:44] and the knowledge
[13:46] that we may be able to attain the glory
[13:49] and the virtue.
[13:52] So now you need to be under the hand of
[13:55] the potter.
[13:58] Let him work upon your life.
[14:01] Let him mold your life.
[14:04] You know just like an eagle
[14:07] when it is raising the small eagle
[14:10] it can steer the nest.
[14:14] Praise the name of the Lord. Where there
[14:16] were thorns.
[14:18] It removes you know it removes the
[14:20] feathers on top the soft landing and
[14:22] then removes everything.
[14:27] But the desire of the mother eagle
[14:31] is that the iglet
[14:34] can develop its nature
[14:37] that the igllet can develop its ability
[14:43] that the iglet can develop the mother
[14:46] ego skills.
[14:50] You know it's just like in life.
[14:53] You can't say me I have a skill when
[14:55] there's no training.
[14:59] Ah, when they give you a motorcycle,
[15:01] say I have the skill of driving riding a
[15:03] motorcycle
[15:05] and so you jump on a motorcycle. You
[15:08] don't know where the gear is. You don't
[15:10] know where the brake is. You don't know
[15:12] where the ignition is. You don't pedal
[15:15] is you don't even know how to balance.
[15:18] You are going to cause an accident.
[15:22] So you were taken through a training.
[15:26] So even the Holy Spirit works upon our
[15:30] lives
[15:32] to bring us into the image of Jesus
[15:34] Christ
[15:35] like the mother ego. Praise the name of
[15:38] our Lord. You may think that the ego has
[15:40] become so cruel.
[15:44] You know how can it start treating the
[15:46] little one?
[15:48] This is part of development of the
[15:51] nature.
[15:55] And then the Bible tells us
[15:58] in Hebrews chapter 5,
[16:01] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord,
[16:05] the book of Hebrews chapter 5
[16:10] and then verse 8. Let us start from
[16:13] verse
[16:15] six.
[16:18] and as he also in another place though
[16:21] at a priest forever after the order of
[16:24] Melisedc.
[16:34] Now you see Christ
[16:36] as the high priest,
[16:38] he came into the bodies that we are.
[16:42] And then the Bible says in verse seven,
[16:47] "For in the days of his flesh,
[16:51] when he had offered up prayers and
[16:54] supplications with strong crying and
[16:56] tears, and to him that was able to save
[16:59] him from death, and was heard, in that
[17:02] he feared.
[17:08] [Music]
[17:26] Though he were a son, yet learned
[17:29] obedience by the things he suffered.
[17:39] The Bible says Christ our savior
[17:48] the things he went through.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord the
[17:54] character molding.
[17:58] There are things that God permits in our
[18:00] lives
[18:03] to develop his nature in us.
[18:07] But then one thing the Lord tells us,
[18:11] he gives us the guideline
[18:14] and that is the word of God.
[18:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[18:18] tells us that you need to have
[18:21] temperance.
[18:25] What does it mean? There are many
[18:27] situations that come in life.
[18:31] There are many things that come
[18:34] where you are exposed
[18:37] you know which are before you
[18:42] know they come at your place of work.
[18:47] Let us start with some things.
[18:50] Praise the name of our Lord.
[18:52] Right now, everybody is looking for
[18:54] money to go back to take children back
[18:56] to school.
[18:59] It's the pressure of the day.
[19:03] And you can have excuses
[19:06] not to come to church because your
[19:09] children have not yet gone back to
[19:10] school.
[19:12] But when you have the temperance of
[19:14] Jesus Christ,
[19:17] you will know that I have to control
[19:20] myself.
[19:25] Praise the name of the Lord.
[19:28] Like now if my work is riding a
[19:30] motorcycle,
[19:33] [Music]
[19:35] praise the name of the Lord. And you
[19:37] know for that business this is a peak
[19:39] hour.
[19:44] Many people are moving.
[19:47] Actually some people know that their
[19:49] money they get it in the morning and in
[19:50] the evening.
[19:55] But now if you have the consciousness of
[19:58] God,
[20:02] temperance will come forward
[20:05] and then you close your business
[20:08] and say let me be in the presence of the
[20:10] Lord
[20:13] because all these things are before us.
[20:16] Praise the name of our Lord. They all
[20:19] before us. But we are called upon
[20:24] to exercise temperance.
[20:28] And temperance
[20:30] is selfont control.
[20:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[20:36] message the state of a perfect man
[20:40] brother Brham says in paragraph 221
[20:46] temperance doesn't mean stop drinking
[20:52] in the world. That's one of the meaning
[20:54] of temperance.
[21:00] But he says no
[21:02] temperance doesn't mean alcoholic chure
[21:10] the Bible temperance
[21:14] the Holy Spirit temperance
[21:18] that is then he says the Holy Spirit
[21:22] temperance
[21:24] is what we are talking about
[21:27] that means
[21:29] how to Control your tongue.
[21:34] Not to be a tler.
[21:38] How to control your temper.
[21:43] Not to fly off every time anybody speaks
[21:46] across to you.
[21:50] You know it it is so broad.
[21:54] But it matters more about your reaction.
[22:00] After an action has come to you,
[22:04] somebody is criticizing you.
[22:07] Somebody's abusing you. Are you going to
[22:10] abuse back?
[22:12] Somebody has stepped on you.
[22:15] Are you going to kick them?
[22:18] Somebody is busy riding you.
[22:22] How are you going to handle such a
[22:24] condition?
[22:26] And you know the things of God, he takes
[22:30] us through the actions.
[22:32] Praise the name of our Lord. God does
[22:34] not assume
[22:37] but he takes you through it to prove
[22:40] what is inside.
[22:44] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[22:46] says
[22:50] and add these things
[22:53] add temperance to it.
[22:56] Temperance.
[22:58] How to answer in kindness.
[23:03] When wrath is spoke to you,
[23:08] somebody say, you bunch of holy rollers
[23:14] down there.
[23:16] Don't jump out
[23:18] and then roll your sleeves.
[23:23] Know that.
[23:25] But talk with godly love,
[23:29] temperance,
[23:31] kindness.
[23:32] Is that the way you want to be?
[23:36] When you are railed upon,
[23:41] you ra not back.
[23:45] Let Christ be your example.
[23:49] Like we can pick up a scripture here
[23:53] in first Peter chapter 2
[23:57] and then verse 21.
[24:02] Chapter 2 verse 21 the Bible says for
[24:05] even here unto were you called because
[24:08] Christ also suffered for us leaving us
[24:11] an example that you should follow his
[24:14] steps.
[24:27] Praise the name of our Lord. Christ gave
[24:29] us an example.
[24:32] And then the Bible says there was no
[24:35] girl found in him.
[24:40] There was no sin found in him.
[24:43] He never spoke anything evil.
[24:47] Now in verse 23,
[24:50] who when he was riled, rod not again.
[24:56] Now you look at Christ,
[24:59] the high priest,
[25:01] the creator of the heavens and the
[25:02] earth. They are calling him Belab.
[25:08] They are calling him all kinds of names.
[25:11] They are accusing him falsely.
[25:14] They are abusing him.
[25:16] The Bible says he never rolled back.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Neither did he show them his authority.
[25:25] He never threatened them.
[25:28] Praise the name of our Lord. But then
[25:30] how many of us can do that?
[25:34] Then you can start telling somebody,
[25:39] &gt;&gt; you will see me today. That was not
[25:42] Christ bragging about his power,
[25:47] telling them that you are going to meet
[25:49] me at the white throne judgment
[25:53] and I'm going to throw you in the fire.
[25:56] He never did that kind of thing.
[25:59] How about us?
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe in our communities where we live.
[26:05] Perhaps maybe you have leadership
[26:07] position
[26:09] or you have some kind of responsibility,
[26:13] maybe in your family,
[26:15] scaring another person,
[26:18] threatening another person.
[26:21] You know maybe at places of work you are
[26:24] a boss over some people
[26:26] and say I'm also going to show him
[26:30] I'm also going to show her
[26:33] that was not Christ.
[26:35] When they abused him when they
[26:38] criticized him he said father forgive
[26:42] them
[26:44] we need to have that same temperance of
[26:46] Jesus Christ.
[26:49] You know whereby you allow to take the
[26:52] pain.
[26:55] Praise the name of our Lord. And you are
[26:57] not seeking revenging.
[27:00] You are not seeking to do harm to
[27:02] somebody else,
[27:05] but you take the pain
[27:07] of what has been put on you.
[27:10] So the Bible says he never threatened
[27:16] but he committed himself to him that
[27:18] judges righteously.
[27:22] Praise the name of our Lord in Matthew 5
[27:25] and verse 39.
[27:28] The Bible says
[27:31] Matthew 5:39,
[27:35] &gt;&gt; "Praise the name of our Lord."
[27:42] So he says,
[27:46] &gt;&gt; "But I say unto you that you should
[27:49] resist no evil, but soever shall smite
[27:54] thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the
[27:58] other also.
[28:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Of course,
[28:15] a smiting on a cheek is painful.
[28:20] But you can imagine turning and even
[28:21] this side.
[28:26] You don't smite them also.
[28:30] Temperance.
[28:32] Praise the name of our Lord. It's the
[28:34] nature of God himself
[28:38] that he comes and molds in us.
[28:42] Praise the name of our Lord and we
[28:44] desire to be like Jesus Christ.
[28:48] And this what brother Brandham was
[28:49] saying. Somebody talks bad about you,
[28:54] you don't talk bad about them.
[28:57] But with love, you forgive them, you
[29:01] bear with them. Praise the name of our
[29:04] Lord. The divine nature of God,
[29:09] but the Holy Spirit that comes and puts
[29:13] that in you.
[29:16] You know, somebody has talked all evil
[29:18] about you.
[29:21] Then you say also also release the
[29:23] gazette.
[29:25] No, it's not like that. Praise the name
[29:28] of our Lord. You know, brother Brandham
[29:30] teaches us that eternal life is living
[29:33] for others.
[29:36] You intercede for that person doing such
[29:38] things.
[29:40] Father forgive them
[29:43] because they don't know what they are
[29:44] doing.
[29:46] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[29:48] message still
[29:51] the state of a perfect man paragraph 224
[29:55] he says when they said
[29:59] if thou be the son of God
[30:03] turn these stones into bread.
[30:07] He could have done it
[30:10] and show he was God.
[30:13] But he had temperance.
[30:17] When they called him Belzeba,
[30:21] he said, "I'll forgive you for it."
[30:25] That's right. They pulled handfuls of
[30:28] his beard out of his face and spit in
[30:30] his face.
[30:35] And they said, "Come down of the cross."
[30:40] He said, "Father, forgive them.
[30:44] They don't even know what they are
[30:47] doing."
[30:50] Temperance. Praise the name of Jesus. We
[30:53] need it in our lives.
[30:55] At our homes, at our places of work,
[30:59] where we study from, wherever we spend
[31:02] our lives,
[31:04] we need to have the temperance of Jesus
[31:06] Christ.
[31:09] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[31:11] says, when he had the gift,
[31:14] he knowed all things.
[31:17] For in him was the fullness of the
[31:19] Godhead bodily.
[31:23] Seen him perform miracles
[31:26] by telling people what was wrong with
[31:29] them.
[31:32] And so forth like that.
[31:35] They put a rug around his head like
[31:37] that,
[31:40] around his eyes and hit him on the head
[31:43] with a stick
[31:46] and said, "Prophesy.
[31:48] Tell us who hit you.
[31:52] We will believe you."
[31:54] See, he had temperance.
[31:58] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[32:00] said, "Now, if you got it like that,
[32:05] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[32:07] there is something the Lord has done in
[32:08] your life.
[32:11] Change that God has done in your life.
[32:14] Then he says if you still blow up
[32:21] and fast and stew
[32:25] and carry on
[32:28] you ain't got no.
[32:32] Praise the name of the Lord.
[32:34] Add that
[32:37] because it won't add.
[32:40] It won't vulcanize.
[32:45] You can't take a piece of rubber,
[32:50] you know, and vulcanize it to a piece of
[32:53] iron.
[32:57] Praise the name of our Lord. There has
[32:59] to be something that is of likeness.
[33:04] Praise the name of our Lord. You can't
[33:06] add temper
[33:09] to the divine nature of God.
[33:12] You can't add you know boastfulness
[33:16] or regret
[33:18] you know to the divine nature of God
[33:22] that is outside completely.
[33:25] So we need to find out where are we in
[33:27] our lives.
[33:29] Praise the name of the Lord. Then he
[33:32] says it just won't work.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; No, it's got to be flexible
[33:44] just like the rubber is. And when your
[33:47] faith
[33:49] and your temperance
[33:52] becomes the same kind of holy ghost
[33:55] temperance
[33:58] that he had
[34:01] then it will vulcanize with him.
[34:05] You are added to it.
[34:10] When your virtue is like his virtue
[34:14] then it will add to it.
[34:17] When your knowledge is like his
[34:19] knowledge,
[34:22] I will come to do thy will. Oh God,
[34:27] see with the father's word,
[34:30] he defeated every devil.
[34:35] Heaven and earth will pass away,
[34:38] but the word will not.
[34:42] When you got that kind of knowledge,
[34:46] It will vulcanize with your faith.
[34:51] When you got the right kind of
[34:53] temperance
[34:56] like a heart, it will vulcanize.
[35:00] If you haven't
[35:03] just a man, a man made halfway
[35:09] sed up belief.
[35:14] Oh, I ought to slap him down,
[35:19] but maybe I better not.
[35:24] They might put my name in the paper
[35:27] about it.
[35:30] And that ain't the kind of temperance
[35:35] we talking about.
[35:37] Now, you know, there are some of these
[35:39] natural things people can try to figure
[35:42] out.
[35:45] You know, he can try to pretend to be
[35:46] patient.
[35:48] He can try to be good. But it is
[35:52] manmade.
[35:53] Even temperance.
[35:55] But for him is looking at the other side
[35:57] of the coin.
[36:00] If I react like that, people will
[36:02] mistaken me.
[36:06] But when he is alone,
[36:08] he will do that because there's nobody
[36:11] who's going to see him.
[36:13] Then he says that is not what it is. But
[36:16] this is something that should come from
[36:18] you
[36:21] because it's a nature that God has
[36:23] molded in you.
[36:26] You're not looking at maybe the
[36:28] publicist of your name.
[36:32] Praise the name of our Lord. But you
[36:34] know you are looking at obeying the word
[36:37] of God.
[36:41] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[36:43] know it also works on the other side.
[36:47] Praise the name of the Lord. You know
[36:49] when the politicians are giving out
[36:51] money,
[36:57] they want the cameras to look at them.
[37:01] There is a minister who was giving out a
[37:03] check
[37:06] and then the camera man was not ready.
[37:09] and they get big dummy checks.
[37:14] Then they put their 50 million shillings
[37:18] on the bank of Uganda
[37:21] and they want the cameraman to be
[37:23] looking at them.
[37:26] So there's a minister who was giving out
[37:29] the check and the cameraman didn't take
[37:32] it. Have you taken it? Not yet. So you
[37:36] bring it back.
[37:38] until now he said are you ready
[37:44] for them they want the left hand to know
[37:46] what the right hand has has given
[37:51] but that's not of Christ
[37:53] said when the right hand gives
[37:57] the left hand not know about it you
[38:00] don't start blowing it up
[38:03] let them know
[38:07] like a soul when he had victory
[38:11] he wanted everybody to know about it.
[38:15] Praise the name of our Lord. That is not
[38:17] of Christ.
[38:19] It's not for show up
[38:23] you know it's not for kind of publicity
[38:27] you know like politicians now
[38:30] they know how to pretend.
[38:33] Now he will go and get some good
[38:35] cameramen.
[38:41] Then he goes
[38:46] and he sits with people
[38:48] eating
[38:51] a show off
[38:55] you know but that's not the way of the
[38:56] Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:59] Praise the name of our Lord. That's not
[39:01] the way of the divine nature of God.
[39:06] Praise the name of our Lord. So then he
[39:08] says
[39:11] that ain't the kind of temperance he's
[39:13] talking about.
[39:16] You don't try to add that
[39:19] it won't work. But when you can really
[39:25] with the sweetness from your heart,
[39:30] forgive every man,
[39:34] hold your peace,
[39:38] let it be gone.
[39:42] See, it will vulcanize.
[39:46] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[39:49] have the temperance of Jesus Christ.
[39:53] Now we see in one of the scriptures here
[39:57] in Genesis chapter 34.
[40:01] Praise the name of our Lord.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Let us go and read that story.
[40:07] Genesis chapter 34.
[40:11] I remember some weeks ago we're talking
[40:13] about seeing the daughters of the land.
[40:19] When dinner the daughter of Jacob went
[40:22] out to see the daughters of the land
[40:28] and then she
[40:31] defiled her.
[40:33] So now the Bible says
[40:36] when Jacob heard in Genesis 34:5
[40:43] When Jacob heard that
[40:46] they had defiled his daughter Dina
[40:52] Genesis 34:5
[40:54] Okay.
[41:07] Now his sons were with him were with his
[41:10] cattle in the field. And Jacob held his
[41:13] peace until they were come.
[41:24] of our Lord. The Bible says he held his
[41:27] peace
[41:30] temperance.
[41:32] He never went immediately and reacted
[41:35] over that situation.
[41:39] And many times we are we are kind of
[41:42] subjected to different situations in
[41:44] life.
[41:47] Praise the name of our Lord. Something
[41:49] happens which you never expected.
[41:53] Do you react to that kind of thing
[41:57] or you just become furious and make a
[42:00] decision immediately
[42:02] or you want to immediately follow the
[42:04] line and say this thing has to I have to
[42:07] destroy this kind of person.
[42:12] The Bible says Jacob held his peace
[42:18] &gt;&gt; until even
[42:22] and his father they came and started
[42:25] talking to him.
[42:28] Praise the name of our Lord. But then
[42:31] you see that the sons of Jacob,
[42:36] they never had any temperance of
[42:37] anything.
[42:40] But they tried to make a way how to
[42:41] treat these people.
[42:46] Tell them if you can circumcise yourself
[42:50] and then you know you can be part of us.
[42:54] We can all circumcise.
[42:58] And when all the men of the city
[42:59] circumcised
[43:03] and they knew that their wounds were now
[43:05] painful.
[43:10] Simeon Simeon
[43:12] &gt;&gt; with his brother went and killed all the
[43:14] male in the city.
[43:18] They never had any form of temperance.
[43:23] Revenge,
[43:26] kill everybody.
[43:28] Yet it was only one person responsible.
[43:32] They just destroyed all the male in the
[43:34] city.
[43:37] And so sometimes we can be we can get
[43:41] ourself into those kind of situations.
[43:45] If you don't have temperance,
[43:48] you may end up speaking something which
[43:50] is not right
[43:54] unadvisably.
[43:58] Praise the name of our Lord. You just do
[44:00] it immediately
[44:03] like Elisha
[44:05] when the children were cursing him.
[44:09] You know they were ridiculing him.
[44:12] You baldheaded maned
[44:15] man had temperance on that.
[44:21] He just cast them until all those
[44:25] children were killed.
[44:27] So now Christ desires us to have
[44:30] temperance in our lives.
[44:34] One day the Lord Jesus was going to a
[44:36] city to preach
[44:39] and then they never received them.
[44:43] So John and James told Jesus,
[44:47] let us call fire like Elijah from
[44:49] heaven.
[44:52] Now for them they were saying we need to
[44:54] follow this Old Testament example here.
[44:56] Now
[45:00] But Jesus told them, you don't know what
[45:03] kind of spirit is on you.
[45:08] He had temperance.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And we also
[45:13] need to exercise temperance to one
[45:15] another.
[45:18] Jesus told them, "The son of man never
[45:21] came to destroy lives.
[45:26] But to save lives,
[45:28] praise the name of we need to have the
[45:31] divine nature of Jesus Christ.
[45:35] Exercising temperance at your place of
[45:37] work.
[45:39] Exercising temperance at your home.
[45:43] Exercising temperance to your neighbor
[45:47] or the people that we interact with
[45:49] anywhere.
[45:51] We need to have temperance for one
[45:53] another.
[45:55] Praise the name of our Lord. Not showing
[45:57] how powerful you are.
[46:00] Not showing how influential you are.
[46:04] Not showing how privileged you are.
[46:08] But the humility of Jesus Christ.
[46:11] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[46:14] exercise temperance.
[46:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[46:20] message
[46:22] the stage of a perfect man.
[46:25] Praise the name of our Lord.
[46:28] And then paragraph 2 230
[46:34] &gt;&gt; he says
[46:42] and then it is put right before you
[46:48] and then you walk away.
[46:51] Well, we will get to that just a few
[46:54] minutes.
[46:56] But when you fly loose,
[47:01] want to jump at every conclusion,
[47:06] that is not it.
[47:09] You haven't got Bible temperance.
[47:13] When you do that, how to answer back,
[47:19] then if you got all this,
[47:22] you can add this to your faith.
[47:26] Temperance,
[47:28] how to handle situations as they come,
[47:32] how you handle challenges as they come.
[47:36] You already pressured by something.
[47:40] But then how do you relate? How do you
[47:41] handle that?
[47:43] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[47:46] message, Christ is the mystery of God
[47:47] revealed.
[47:51] Brother Brenham says
[47:54] a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[47:58] for a prisoner.
[48:01] See when God gets you to be his prisoner
[48:06] then you can't do nothing
[48:11] but what the spirit says do.
[48:15] Praise the name of our lord. You know
[48:17] you are developed in nature.
[48:20] I can do nothing of my own
[48:23] but what I see the father doing
[48:26] you'll find it is something that is
[48:28] automatic.
[48:31] It's not something that you think about
[48:35] the options.
[48:38] Ah maybe this one is bad, this one is
[48:40] okay.
[48:41] But it is a nature that is in you.
[48:45] You know the way it is that when a fly
[48:48] is coming to your eyes
[48:53] then your eyes automatically blinks.
[48:57] So even the nature of Christ,
[49:00] it just comes out
[49:03] selfcontrol.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Like Job,
[49:10] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord. He
[49:12] exercised temperance
[49:16] when he had bad news in one day of all
[49:19] the things that befell him in Job
[49:20] chapter one.
[49:24] The children have died. The animals have
[49:27] been stolen. These have been done. This
[49:30] have been
[49:31] done. He exercised self-control.
[49:36] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[49:39] just woripped.
[49:41] Naked I came into the world. Naked will
[49:44] I go. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[49:48] exercised temperance.
[49:50] How about us?
[49:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Maybe
[49:54] you're going through hardrations at home
[49:58] or hardrations at your place of work.
[50:02] Are you going to start cursing God
[50:05] or are you going to blame the time
[50:07] you've spent in church
[50:12] temperance,
[50:14] you know, you learn how to control
[50:16] yourself.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Job learned
[50:21] that
[50:23] even Paul here, brother Brandham says he
[50:27] was a prisoner
[50:29] he could not do anything.
[50:32] Paul with all the his great intellect.
[50:36] He was taught by Gile
[50:41] to be a great priest or a rabbi someday.
[50:46] He had high ambitions.
[50:49] He was intellectual, a great man,
[50:57] great authority,
[51:00] great man in the nation.
[51:02] But he had to sacrifice every bit of it.
[51:08] see to become part of the word
[51:14] to express Jesus Christ.
[51:17] There was a trade off to do.
[51:25] Praise the name of our Lord, empty
[51:28] himself
[51:31] in order to receive.
[51:33] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[51:35] the same thing the Lord desires of us.
[51:39] Praise the name of our Lord. That's why
[51:41] the Bible says, "If you're a man of high
[51:44] estate,
[51:46] humble yourself down to the least of the
[51:49] people
[51:54] like our Lord Jesus Christ. He
[51:57] condescended himself
[52:00] to the least of the people to the lowest
[52:03] of the place
[52:05] going to hell
[52:07] until even the least person in work
[52:13] you know the the flank the one who
[52:15] washes the feet
[52:18] he found I can't do the job on this man
[52:21] here
[52:23] he went to the list of the places
[52:28] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[52:30] the Bible, brother Brandham says,
[52:33] &gt;&gt; but he had to sacrifice every bit of it
[52:39] to become part of the word to express
[52:43] Jesus Christ. He knowed what it was.
[52:48] Praise the name of the Lord. He had a
[52:50] notion to go over some place.
[52:56] Some brethren had called him
[52:59] but he was forbidden by the spirit
[53:02] to do his own will.
[53:05] If people have spiritual can pick that
[53:08] up.
[53:15] He was forbidden to do his own will.
[53:20] The spirit forbide him.
[53:22] He was a prisoner to Christ.
[53:25] Then this little fortune teller one day
[53:35] one day who he knowed
[53:39] Paul know he had power to cast that
[53:42] devil out
[53:45] but he could not only do it
[53:49] as God willed it
[53:53] day after day
[53:56] she followed him, cried out after him.
[54:01] See the temperance,
[54:04] it is something bad they are doing to
[54:06] you.
[54:08] But he was patient
[54:12] until it was the will of God
[54:15] to cast out that evil spirit,
[54:18] crying after him.
[54:21] But wanted the spirit give him
[54:23] permission.
[54:24] [Music]
[54:26] Then he rebuked her. The spirit that was
[54:30] in her,
[54:32] he knowed what it was to be a prisoner.
[54:38] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[54:40] exercise the temperance of God
[54:43] at our places of work, at our schools,
[54:47] even at our home and wherever we are.
[54:51] Praise the name of our Lord. You deny
[54:53] your rights.
[54:55] You are not there to use your power all
[54:57] the time.
[54:59] All the authority you have, all the
[55:02] privileges you have.
[55:04] Praise the name of our Lord. But you
[55:06] want to take the way of the Lord is
[55:08] despised.
[55:11] Learning selfont control.
[55:15] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[55:17] know temperance
[55:20] can cover so many things.
[55:26] Even our very lifestyle.
[55:29] How we behave ourselves, how we conduct
[55:32] ourselves.
[55:34] Are you there to show off all the time?
[55:38] Praise the name of the Lord. Are you
[55:40] there to do things in the extremes?
[55:44] No. We need to exercise the temperance.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. The Lord
[55:51] Jesus Christ coming down to the lower
[55:54] level.
[55:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Not showing
[55:59] who you are.
[56:01] Not you know being up everywhere.
[56:05] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[56:07] have that temperance.
[56:10] We see that Jacob exercised
[56:12] self-control.
[56:16] He humbled himself.
[56:20] He handled things calmly.
[56:23] Praise the name of our Lord. And in
[56:25] life, we are required to do the same
[56:26] thing. He just react over everything.
[56:31] But you take time.
[56:33] Praise the name of our Lord. How you
[56:36] handle things how you relate things.
[56:40] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[56:42] have the temperance of Jesus Christ.
[56:45] May God bless you.
[56:47] Amen.
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:54] Amen. Let us stand up and sing a song
[56:55] and we can pray to the Lord.
[57:00] Must Jesus bear the cross alone. Praise
[57:02] the name of our Lord.
[57:08] Must Jesus
[57:10] bear the cross alone
[57:15] and all the world go free.
[57:22] No, there is a cross for everyone.
[57:30] And there is a cross for me.
[57:38] The cause
[57:42] cross I'll bear till death shall set me
[57:50] free.
[57:53] Then go
[57:56] home
[57:57] my crown to wear for there is a crown
[58:05] for me

[58:10] the cream. Stop pment

[58:53] day.
[58:57] The angels
[59:00] from the stars
[59:03] come down
[59:06] and bear my soul
[59:10] away. M Jesus again has got to pray.
[59:14] As Jesus
[59:17] fell the cross
[59:20] alone
[59:23] and all the world
[59:27] go free
