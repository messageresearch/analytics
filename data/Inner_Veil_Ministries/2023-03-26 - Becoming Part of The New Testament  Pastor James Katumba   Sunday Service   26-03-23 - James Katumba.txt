and break it and gave it the disciples and said take it this is my body yes and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it not always for this is my blood of the new testament which is shared for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom series Lord we thank you for the reading of the world now call Upon Your Name Lord the Holy Spirit these scriptures may come Lord and make them known unto us as we have need of today bless our hearts all together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated so I want to preach on the subject becoming part of the New Testament okay first we want to appreciate brother Wilson for the Sunday School Sunday school praise the name of our Lord and I just pray that we do better on our coming to church area that we may not miss any activity of the church I also forgot to tell you that from Wednesday I was away on Wednesday I was preaching in its District then on Thursday I was preaching's District I was in those areas foreign so now here in Matthew 26 verse 28. it says for this is the blood of the new testament which is shared for many for the remission of sins praise the name of our Lord so I want to preach on the subject becoming part of the New Testament praise the name of our Lord how do you become part of the New Testament and you know many people because they see that Jesus came yesterday and when Jesus came yes and we see that the New Testament praise the name of our Lord when you read in Matthew chapter one and then verse it says the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham so it starts with Jesus Christ himself praise the name of Allah so now people think that because Jesus came so they are also automatically in the New Testament but the New Testament is a convenience praise the name of Allah the New Testament is an agreement and you see an agreement you have to also agree to be part of it praise the name of Allah you know when when somebody is selling their land you know they write about who is sailing who is how much money is this person what is the size of the land who are the neighbors around where is the land located it's maybe on this plot in this Village or in this District here there are details in that agreement so even our God doesn't enjoying us to his convenience without first introducing to us his testimony he introduces to us that Covenant president and the seventh Elders of Israel and worship you are far off and Moses alone shall come near the Lord but you shall not come nigh neither shall the people go up with him so now in verse he says and Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the judgments and all the people answered with one voice all the ones which the Lord has said we will do now we see here Moses was making a testament with the children of Israel and joining them to the Lord but before Moses would enjoying the children of Israel [Music] he came and read to all the people now the words of the Lord and the judgments what does this mean he came and read to them Exodus chapter 20. which talks about the ten commands and then after telling them he told them the judgments for each commandment and if and then so he told them Exodus chapter 20. Exodus chapter 21. praise the name of our Lord so he wrote them all these things he made them known unto them and then the Bible says and all the people answer let us go to Romans foreign and then here we start from the verse 14. how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and thou shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and thou shalt they hear without a preacher so then here Moses was sent to them and when Moses was sent to them he was sent with a gospel he was sent with the word so then he comes with the word and then he ministers the word of God unto them and now when these people hear the words then they say all that the Lord has said we will do the same pattern on the day of Pentecost Peter comes and preaches to these people who are gathered there on the day and tell them about Jesus Christ how we should die and now we should research and now we should take away the sins and now when these people the word of the news what shall we do praise the name of our Lord in the same format in the Old Testament when we go back to Exodus chapter 24. the people heard the words of Moses I said all the ones which the Lord has said we will do so what is it they have known The Testament they have known the contents of the testimony and even the same thing you know you get to know the information about the property and then when you are contented about everything then you proceed father to endorse it you know to to sign on it to own it now when you go to Exodus chapter young men of the children of Israel which is offerings of oxen unto the Lord never were you everywhere and Moses took half of the blood and put it in person and half of the blood is sprinkled on the altars and he took the book of the convenience and read it in the audience of the people and they say [Applause] and be obey the Bible says when the people had accepted the convenience Supreme Court the blood upon them and he sprinkled the blood upon the books then he says in verse 8. and Moses took the blood Moses which the Lord has made with you concerning all these words foreign so here the scripture says for when Moses had every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of Curves and gods with water and Scarlet wool and high soap and sprinkled both the book and all the people foreign [Music] which God has enjoined moreover his sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry um praise the name of our Lord so he sprinkled the blood on the book of The Testament and on the people in an equivalent to make them part of the Testament praise the name of Allah so in the Old Testament the children of Israel were enjoying to The Testament by the blood of animals praise the name of our Lord in the New Testament we are enjoying together we become part of the New Testament by the same way by the blood of Jesus Christ we become part of the New Testament foreign let us start from verse 32. this this Jesus has God raised up whereof we are all Witnesses yes therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shared forth this which you now see and hear our way for this David is not ascended into the heavens but he has saved himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit on my right hand until I make the foreign therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made the same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ is the name of Allah so then Peter here was introducing to them the New Testament so then for you to be part of the New Testament you must first hear the content of the Testaments what is the word of The Testament you must hear it for yourself when you hear that word when you believe that one you received that one now when you believe that [Music] he says what the New Testament means New Covenant of what Jesus Christ has raised from the dead yes show that Jesus has met every requirement for us yes yes and is alive today the token proves is alive to identify himself with us according to his promise praise the name of our Lord so the New Testament is the Holy Ghost Testament so now to be part of the New Testament it means that the blood of Jesus Christ it means that you have accepted into akiriza the blood of Jesus Christ to take away your sins and now when the blood has taken away you have also received the life from the black praise the name of Allah because the blood has the life so now if God has remitted yourself then you should also have the Life of Christ and this is what Peter was by receiving the spirit of God by receiving a new life by receiving the life of Jesus Christ the life of Jesus himself then you can confidently saying I know so even now in the new Texas you receive the word of God after receiving the words you accept it when you accept it you repent you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of yourself and then you receive the gift of God praise the name of Allah as a confirmation that you are in the New Testament praise the name of Allah and that should always be our hearts desire if I have received Christ I need also to have the life if you have repented of the other things why do you go back to the same way why don't you deny the nature of sin right away why don't you get away from the things that are right over that we surrender ourselves for the life of Jesus Christ to be effective in us for the life of Jesus Christ to be completely taking a hold of our lives but you see a challenge that we have something people don't thoroughly repent Advance they won't hold something by themselves and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins there is no uncertain about that you shall receive the gift of the Holy ghosts maybe you win perhapsuna [Music] is emphasizing it it is if you really repent and then you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ through the scripture says you shall receive the gift of the Holy ghosts but it says when when you've repented you go you go in there without repenting and you won't get it for now I don't know why you're not broadcasting that quote but when you started repentance and Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ but when you started a repentance and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you are going to get it are you hearing he says when you salary and Believe on the Lord Jesus I'm saying well yes you are going to get it for now so then when you want to be part of the New Testament they determined to be part of it praise the name of Allah not changing churches not having new ideas turn yourself from away from the things of the world and you fully accept the Lord you know you repent and turn your back away from it is just like the two sons the scripture says he went to the first [Music] the question receive my life they didn't consider you know their failures and weaknesses we can make it praise the name of Allah they were like those lepers in the days of samaris when there was swimming all over the land praise the name of us when those lepers told one another let us go to the camp of this so they never considered you know they are leprosy all their infirmities so your sins be as Scarlet baby [Music] shall be whiters you shall eat the good of them the scriptures so they'd be like red like Crimson they shall be like praise the name of them so you see the blood of Jesus Christ takes away all our pasties and it also takes away our present sins praise the name of our Lord it took away all your past sins when you [Music] it changes your character [Music] foreign now I want to read in this message praise the name of our lord it's in the Cod he says I don't care how dark the night is I'm coming to Father it might be so dark till you could feel it you could put your hands up like this and could not see a shadow of no type then this little bit of light will expose that Darkness certainly that's the way life does in the presence of death that's the way life does in the presence of Rome [Music] that's the way Faith does in the presence so you need to have that little faith as a mustard seed foreign Abraham restored Ibrahimovic when you have that list little tinkling in your heart for Christ you do it right away because that is the greatest thing of color that ever happened to you that is for God to call you to the wedding supper of his son I don't know anything greater yo so when you hear the chords go to my garden maybe it was two weeks maybe was failing a lot but he turned and went he was not like the Pharisees praise the name of Allah but he accepted the calling we also need to do the same thing to receive them praise the name of it so then we need to see that when we receive the world so let us thoroughly repent praise the name of Allah with all your hearts praise the name of our Lord you know telling God I'm sure I'll accept my failure I'm sure I'll accept my sins when the prophet Nathan came to him in Psalms 51. let us go there yeah Psalms 51 and verse 1. the scripture says have mercy upon me o oh according to thy loving kind according transgressions me from my sins my sin is foreign [Music] [Music] is the same one [Music] you also need to get for eign but you need to believe that as I have repented praise the name of Allah you just need to have faith like last time we were seeing because that they were applying the Blood using High soap and you can get this with everywhere what God requires of us is praise the name of us so when you hear the words that is mine it's not for someone I'm receiving this word for myself and then the word transforms the word changes that's how it works praise the name of Allah you know the Pharisees when they come to John the Baptista they asked him who are you accordingly when they come to Jesus who gave you that Authority but when the publicans and the Sinners come to jump what shall we do total difference is depending upon himself righteousness are you preaching to us what is your level of Education where do you come from but the one who wants it what shall we do a right attitude praise the name of Allah they came with the right attitude so they were able to receive delivery they were to receive forgiveness who are you what are your credentials no [Music] I'm anointed no but he said Lord have sinned against you I'm not against you only today so we need to learn how to thoroughly repentance you know there are some people praise the name of our Lord like I ever saw it somewhere somebody came in a meeting and started talking all the dirty things he was doing no that that's not what I'm talking about you come before and tell them which doctor how you used to get eggs I used to get these things broken bottles or broken [Music] we don't want those narratives because even the Bible says it is a shame to speak about these things which are done in darkness that's what the scripture says and the scripture says even communication be corrupt so you find that you're destroying somebody's mind but if you are coming to repent before just say Lord has delivered me from maybe this evil don't point to the details praise the name of Allah and then praise the name of Allah if you have done it against the Lord you do it before the Lord you repent it in your prayer time let us continue in Psalms 51. and then verse 16. he says for your desire not sacrifice else I would give it you desire not you'd like you'd like band offering everywhere the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and the contrite heart oh God thou will not despise so the scripture is telling us the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh God you will not despise the sacrifice a broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart um one which is sincere before God you know you have broken the Stony heart condition out of your heart you are not you are not hiding anything no you are being sincere you know when like in the Old Testament when they had the word they said all that is saying we will do now they were doing they were confessing in their own in let me say in the ability of man but then you see that in the Old Testament after Moses making a covenant with them thank you and the first Commandments the first the first the first kind of article of the Covenant you shall have no other gods before me then the second commandment you shall not worship them foreign statements of the convenience even if you before you finish reading the whole documentary you started with these ones before you okay but now when Moses went to the mountains and he was there for a number of days 40 days why did the children of Israel do they went we don't know what has become of this month make us gods they were breaking the Covenant they had met but now this Covenant of the the New Testament s made by the blood of animals so the life of animals would not come on the worshipers the life of Jesus Christ comes down to the worshipers and that should be your honest desire is that as you repent fill me with your holy spirit let your life come down so when the life comes down in you you are not going to go back to the things you left you're not going to have the love of the things of the world you're not going to go back to things which are not right before there is a newness of life you have turned your back the things of the world right because the life of Jesus Christ lives of animals not come on the worship but in the New Testament The Life of Christ comes down in the heart of the worship praise the name of Allah so it creates you it makes your new creation so when we come you need to [Music] knitting how to be sincere Lord have my support now if you have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ you have confessed to him you need to be baptized with the name of Jesus you need to be baptized in water you need to be immersed in what way the scripture says in Acts chapter 2 and then verse 38. praise the name of our Lord Acts 2 38. then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy ghosts um foreign [Music] it's not written in the description you know some denominations they sprinkle water in the foreign foreign in the message the church and its conditions that's what's the matter with people don't receive the Holy Ghost when they are baptized they just don't thoroughly repent God is trying to give them the Holy Ghost he wants you to be meek and gentlemen quiet that's the reason you get up with that same selfishness that would not make you have the Holy Ghost you've got to get up from there a different person you've got to get up from there quiet it's not difficult [Music] foreign so it is us to receive he has been given why don't you receive then the issue is how do you receive homophones now in the message the Feast of the trumpets also that the church has bound the whole Maybe you see the Holy Ghost was raised on the day of Pentacles but he says the church the denominational system the religious system have bound the Holy Ghost for two thousand years back there and under the church ages but at the though of Creeds and doggyers that the Holy Ghost cannot work in the church because of man-made systems but she is going to be liberated she is coming back that's what the Bible says the religious system they bound the Holocaust by their Creeds by their unbelief there's something with us we can also bind the holies by our unbelief by our doubt I don't think it is mine I don't think I can make it here by the things that we get ourselves so that you don't receive the Holy Ghost so now okay but now when you get the true word of God the true word of God liberates because you put away those things that are contrary to them foreign [Music] to have Liberty to come down in our songs so let us not bind the Holy Spirit by our unbelief let us not bind the horse by the things that we hear that have contrary today praise the name of our Lord now in the message what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Spirit what is it and now the reason I have taken this subject in line like this you cannot come to his and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive foreign and you cannot receive it if you know what unless you believe it is given to you and it is for you it doesn't work then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings so if you know what it is and who it is and what action it brings when it comes then you will know right now what you've got when you get it that just would say to it so then he says you need to know what is foreign [Music] Christ himself living in you are working in you transforming into our future so what do you do Lord I Surrender just to surrender to him Lord I give you all my life I give you all my mind I give you all my desires sure deliver me from this you must have a desire [Music] [Music] you know Christian Life foreign [Music] allow an exchange [Music] let it be a testimony foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign we are learning from him and then he says when you come to him you learn from him you take upon you where Tika he's your question praise the name of it what is the Yoke of God praise the name of Allah what is the York you know a York they put it on the shoulder foreign rest unto your soul and then he tells us for my Yorkies and my burden is light so it is easy Chango why do you carry your heavy burdens when there is a light bar in here because it is him who comes in your life when you become part of the Testament the New Testament it is Christ his own life it's no longer your life it is the life of Jesus himself that governs you that takes a hold of your life praise the name of Allah like a person it's no longer I that living but it's the Lord Jesus Christ and so we need to allow God to take over our lives and to rule over our lives to take over our lives [Music] by this we know that we love the children of God and when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and these Commandments are not Grievous he says his Commandments Matthew chapter 11. and then verse 29. my burden is not a difficult thing [Music] and let the word of God be fully in you that it will instruct you in your decision making instruction every thought that you go through like a normal person a normal person when you go to bed you wake up that's normal there is a principle in the natural life but when I sleep I wake up and as I move around today I feel hungry and when I feel hungry it's a different life part of you foreign [Music] [Music] he says if any person loves me if a man love me he will keep my words where is your love for God your love for God is expressed in obedience to the word of God so you cannot say Lord I love you and then you don't obey himself so he says if any man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him so when you hear the word when you hear the word of the Testaments and that word of The Testament then the blood of the sacrifice the life from the blood of Jesus will come down in your heart this is what he's saying here if any man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him you know so let me get good animals and then give sacrifices but that was not the thing and then the prophet told him let us go and pick that scripture praise the name of our Lord in the book of First Samuel chapter 15. praise the name of our Lord verse 20. and so say that somewhere yeah I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and I've gone the way the law which the Lord sent to me and have brought the king of amalek and of utterly destroyed the amalekites of America but the people took of the spoil the sheep and The Oxen the chief of the things which should have been utter destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in gilgar about and Samuel said has the Lord has great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hacking than the fight of rams same way you know some people they think sacrifices are above obedience the word of God and so you find people have different programs now the word of God tells us to pray very good the word of God tells us to fast very good the words the word of God tells us to to give it and all the different things which you can do as a sacrifice which you can do as a Living Sacrifice but none of those things and then he's saying I'm bringing to sacrifice to the Lord [Music] but then he was told to destroy everything then why wouldn't you destroy everything and then you give offerings after you've destroyed everything so then you get people they think that God can change his mind over his words this is what I think I'm not going to pray about it what are you going to who are you going to pray too until the sun goes down supposing Jesus comes in the evening foreign praise the name of our Lord so we need to be obedient more than sacrifices and this is what Samuel was telling so praise the name of it so God Delights when our hearts are obedient unto him praise the name of Allah broken heart contrite spirit let us go to Psalms 34 18. as I try to wind up foreign and then verse 18. so the scripture says whether Psalm is 34 18 sorry he says the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and serve such as be of a contrite spirit um you want God to be near you you want to be the dwelling place of God God is near those of a broken heart experience see that you have that you are genuine you are sincere the most simple praise the name of Allah you know Lord this is my mistake this is the thing I've done which is wrong have a broken heart have a contrite spirit and let this be part of you daily not the ones praise the name of Allah always seek forgiveness when you do something wrong repenting to one another forgiving one another not having a Stony heart I will not forgive that one I will not repent to that that is the Stony house but we need to have you know a broken heart experience Lord sure this is my mistake Lord is my friend foreign [Music] and the none of the other three grounds that could be foreign [Music] being under the same conditions in this world we are living under the same Temptations we are living under the same trials there's some challenges if there is it for school fees but why does it come for you in the times of Trials what kind of heart do you have what kind of ground do you have praise the name of Allah so what you need break the stones remove your Stony house when the wine drops there it will be able to grow even in the midst of all challenges the word will sink it will continue the roots will go deeper foreign [Music] it also makes mistakes it also fails in one way or another one but this heart when it makes mistakes when it sins it is the honest that it is broken down and says Lord have mercy upwards is a contractor when I do something wrong then I call on the name of the Lord Lord have mercy promise US Lord this is my mistake Lord this is my area look what David a man with the heart of God when he went in sin praise the name of Allah you have spoken the truth it's all about me foreign [Music] [Music] let us go to Isaiah Isaiah 57 and verse 15 Isaiah praise the name of our Lord the scripture says in verse 15. that says the high and loved one that inhabited eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and revive the heart of the contrite foreign guava [Music] [Music] we have an opportunity that the Holy Spirit has given us Liberty and has given us you know opportunity to come and Dread in us to abide in us to watch over us [Music] [Music] becomes a pleasure to every believer you are focused people just live enough religion to make them miserable knowing that they ought to do this they are trying to escape if that's the way I felt about it I don't know what I would do oh get in with Christ for to commune with him my word is not Grievous you know you just love it it is part of you praise the name of it it's just something that is inside of you so he says to commune with God is a pleasure it is beautiful it is something that feels and satisfies the soul something that gives you the peace that surpasses all understands all the crosses become a flying wings all the burdens are chariots [Music] [Music] but we need to get in the New Testament foreign [Music] [Music] when I was in that place I was telling them praise the name of Allah
