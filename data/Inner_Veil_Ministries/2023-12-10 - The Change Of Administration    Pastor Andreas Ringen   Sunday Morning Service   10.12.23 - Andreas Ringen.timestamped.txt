[19:33] Samuel you all know the story of
[19:37] David second
[19:42] Samuel
[19:46] 1 we want to read I think this is a
[19:50] Bible
[19:51] story that we are very familiar
[19:55] with and so but from that Bible story
[19:59] because as we know our
[20:01] Bible and as
[20:03] Believers whatever Branch we come
[20:07] from whatever background we
[20:10] have those Bible
[20:13] stories should be known unto
[20:16] us amen so everybody should really know
[20:20] about
[20:22] David that's why I want to use this
[20:24] Bible
[20:26] story to show the change of
[20:31] administration that taken place in our
[20:36] day amen amen can we say praise the
[20:40] Lord hallelujah you are wonderful people

[21:26] had taken place
[21:30] you understand that it was from
[21:34] Saul to
[21:36] David amen
[21:39] amen Again David gathered together all
[21:42] the chosen men of Israel 30,000 and
[21:45] David arose and went with all the people
[21:47] that were with him from Bal and Judah to
[21:50] bring up from hence the AR of God whose
[21:53] name is called by the name of the Lord
[21:55] of host that dwelleth between the kobin

[24:06] floor USA put forth his hand to the Ark
[24:08] of God and took hold of it for the oxen
[24:11] shook
[24:14] [Music]
[24:25] it and the anger of the Lord was
[24:27] kindered against us and God smed him
[24:29] there for his error and there he died by
[24:32] the Ark of
[24:40] [Music]
[24:44] God and David was displeased because the
[24:47] Lord had made a breach upon us and he
[24:49] called the name of the place Paris us to

[25:46] David how David made a
[25:50] mistake that mistake
[25:52] was because he was not

[28:00] hallelujah hallelujah amen am amen am
[28:04] change of
[28:07] administration amen as we are here and
[28:10] and as we are
[28:12] in I believe we are living in a
[28:14] tremendous
[28:17] time I don't know if we are aware of it
[28:20] as
[28:22] Believers if you would ask the political
[28:26] leaders of every
[28:30] country they cannot be honest in
[28:36] public if the if the leaders of the
[28:40] nations of the
[28:43] countries would be
[28:46] honest how the situation
[28:50] is people would start a
[28:54] war amen that's why by the the leaders
[28:58] of
[29:01] Nations you cannot expect them to tell
[29:04] the
[29:06] truth because people cannot handle the
[29:09] truth
[29:13] anymore sometimes people are
[29:16] complaining that the leaders is not
[29:19] telling the
[29:21] truth but if they would tell you the
[29:24] truth how could handle truth
[29:30] how could handle
[29:32] that amen amen if they really the lead
[29:36] and and we are so far in every leader of
[29:38] every nation we have a leader in
[29:42] [Music]
[29:43] Germany we have our presidents and we
[29:45] have our
[29:48] Governors and if you would really if you
[29:51] would really get them
[29:55] personally and uh
[29:57] they they will tell you a great change
[30:00] is taking
[30:02] place the president of
[30:05] Germany could tell
[30:07] you I have not to say
[30:11] so I'm not the real
[30:15] administrator there's another
[30:18] administrator that stands above
[30:20] me you have seen that in
[30:24] Corona the corona uh uh what was there
[30:27] around the
[30:29] world actually no
[30:32] country decided on their
[30:34] own is that right no
[30:38] country decided on their
[30:41] own you here in
[30:43] Uganda you get a certain
[30:47] support if you would do what somebody
[30:51] else
[30:53] said amen this is what it was
[30:58] remember the president of Tanzania at
[31:00] that
[31:01] time he was he was fighting against
[31:04] certain because he he was a
[31:08] Christian amen and finally he
[31:11] died finally he died because somebody
[31:14] else has to say
[31:17] so you here in
[31:19] Uganda with your
[31:21] government is trying to keep up a
[31:23] certain
[31:26] standard to
[31:30] morality is is that right we had in
[31:33] Germany we had a
[31:35] law from the
[31:39] 1950s that to be a
[31:43] homosexual you had to go to
[31:48] prison it was a
[31:50] law that law was
[31:54] removed a long time ago
[32:00] amen so you understand why was this law
[32:04] removed we still had
[32:07] presidents that believed in that
[32:10] law but there was a greater force behind
[32:15] it it said
[32:17] plainly you have to remove the
[32:21] law amen you you know who standing
[32:24] behind so all leaders
[32:28] they are the leaders of a
[32:30] Nation but in the
[32:32] background somebody else is
[32:36] standing and if you not
[32:39] conform to a certain
[32:42] image they put sanctions on
[32:45] you they put pressure on the
[32:49] Nations amen they put sanctions on the
[32:53] people so finally there's a great change
[32:55] of administration
[32:59] can we believe
[33:00] that there is no place on
[33:05] Earth which we could call
[33:12] Paradise absolutely not you go to the I
[33:16] go to I go to a very far away
[33:20] places I am on the islands in the
[33:24] Pacific you go to a little Island far
[33:27] away in the
[33:30] Pacific just far
[33:32] away they're living some native
[33:37] people but even
[33:39] they cannot
[33:41] hide on their little
[33:45] Islands because this has also reached
[33:50] them it has reached
[33:53] them amen they sometimes they don't have
[33:56] much to
[33:59] eat but they they they have all
[34:05] this amen so you understand
[34:08] they they are under influence
[34:13] anyhow you know how much that influences
[34:19] you you know how much that influences
[34:23] you you know that today in Wars
[34:27] you know they have the
[34:30] saying the first thing that dies in a
[34:34] war is the
[34:38] truth the first thing that dies in a
[34:43] war is the
[34:45] truth because
[34:47] everyone V in media V
[34:52] media bringing out his
[34:55] View to the
[34:57] people you wake up in the
[35:00] morning and on your news there's all
[35:02] kind of news what's going
[35:05] on in Uganda in the
[35:08] world and people trying to influence
[35:12] you their
[35:14] view what is going on is that right so
[35:18] the Bible would say in Revelations
[35:23] 13:8 all that dwell upon the Earth
[35:28] all that dwell upon the Earth if they
[35:30] are in Uganda if they in Germany if they
[35:34] in the Pacific if they on an Islands
[35:38] wherever they are all will
[35:41] worship all will
[35:43] worship finally Satan
[35:46] all whose names were not written in
[35:51] the and we see such an IM immense change
[35:55] of administration taking
[35:59] just a
[36:01] change where where you can see your own
[36:06] home where the husband is actually the
[36:09] head of the
[36:11] home but because of because of all the
[36:15] influences many times other people
[36:18] decide with
[36:20] him you send your children to
[36:23] school which is the normal way
[36:27] that we are living now somebody else is
[36:31] influencing your
[36:32] child somebody else it's just helping
[36:36] you to raise your
[36:39] child is that right so it's an
[36:42] administration of
[36:44] change and you cannot go against it you
[36:48] cannot change
[36:49] it this world sooner or
[36:53] later like the world in the days of Noah
[36:57] it will be destroyed with
[37:00] fire why why because it's a rotten
[37:05] system you cannot go against
[37:08] it have patience and wait till the Lord
[37:11] is doing
[37:14] it amen so there's a change of
[37:20] administration also as we see that in
[37:22] the
[37:23] natural as brother Bram would say and I
[37:27] want I trust you you you understand the
[37:30] message and and uh as brother Ron would
[37:34] say he said it I think in The Sixth
[37:38] Seal maybe I can still read it quickly
[37:41] to remind
[37:43] you brother R said in the six
[37:46] seal brother Ram said about the same
[37:51] time the anti
[37:55] Antichrist moves himself fully on the
[38:01] scene the
[38:03] Antichrist he is the one that is finally
[38:06] controlling the
[38:08] [Music]
[38:09] world is that right the Antichrist
[38:13] finally he's the one that controls the
[38:17] world and and and we don't have to try
[38:20] to excuse
[38:22] that even here in
[38:25] Uganda you are not your
[38:28] own you will find that out very
[38:32] soon when they have to bring laws
[38:37] in that allow
[38:41] homosexuality in Germany not only
[38:44] homosexuality is
[38:47] allowed everything else is
[38:50] allowed they just was discussing a law
[38:53] in the in the parliament just
[38:57] maybe I told you that before but
[39:01] I they debated a law in the
[39:06] Parliament that would allow
[39:09] people to change their
[39:15] [Music]
[39:16] gender as often as they
[39:25] want
[39:28] so that's not a
[39:30] joke grownup
[39:34] men grownup
[39:37] woman debating in the
[39:40] parliament how
[39:44] often people could change their
[39:48] genda so for
[39:50] example I'm I'm a
[39:53] male
[39:55] but I decide tomorrow I want to be a
[40:03] female so I go to the
[40:05] government and tell them from
[40:09] tomorrow you call I want to be called
[40:14] M they changed my
[40:17] passport yes they changed my
[40:20] passport my passport I'm not Ming
[40:25] him Miss is ringing
[40:28] [Music]
[40:31] now so I can do
[40:34] that and if I'm
[40:36] tired next
[40:38] week or next
[40:41] month somebody calling me
[40:46] Ms I can
[40:49] change to be a
[40:55] cat
[40:56] it's not a joke it's not a joke
[40:59] it's it happened in our
[41:03] Parliament so they change my
[41:08] passport I don't know how they call Mr
[41:11] or Mrs
[41:19] I'm then if I'm half year
[41:22] later have year later
[41:25] come I'm tired of somebody calling me
[41:33] cat I have the right to be a
[41:43] [Applause]
[41:45] [Music]
[41:49] tree we love about
[41:51] it and that is the best thing to
[41:55] do but that happened in
[41:59] reality why do they do that become
[42:03] somebody else tell
[42:05] them you have to conform in
[42:10] Germany to a certain
[42:14] standard and don't laugh
[42:17] now that will happen to you
[42:20] also comes there comes a day when your
[42:24] government can hide away from
[42:27] that because behind
[42:30] it as brother Bren would say is the
[42:35] Antichrist that that
[42:38] Satan he shows his dirty
[42:44] being and
[42:46] manifesting and forcing
[42:48] people now to do it for
[42:54] him well listen listen what brother bam
[42:57] said he said he said as the
[43:02] Antichrist and the
[43:05] Antichrist he he is
[43:08] copying the same thing as Christ is
[43:15] doing remember it is the
[43:19] Antichrist it's against
[43:22] Christ amen and he is C
[43:26] in the same
[43:29] system what Christ is
[43:32] doing the
[43:35] Antichrist is like
[43:37] Christ the head of a
[43:44] body and the
[43:47] body is the
[43:51] people come on
[43:53] Church the body of the Antichrist
[43:58] is the
[43:59] people that's why the Bible said All
[44:02] Shall worship
[44:04] Him All Shall worship
[44:07] him we have seen
[44:09] yesterday worship requires a
[44:16] w
[44:18] amen and allow me to say that to make
[44:20] that
[44:22] clear the womb of the
[44:25] Antichrist
[44:26] is the
[44:28] people All Shall
[44:32] worship All Shall
[44:34] worship whose names were not written in
[44:37] the ls of
[44:38] God the whole world will worship
[44:41] him they will be the
[44:44] womb and then brother Bram said he said
[44:48] when the Antichrist
[44:50] spirit moves fully on the
[44:54] scene gods moves fully on the
[45:00] seene what you see in the
[45:04] negative God is doing in the
[45:09] positive it was always like
[45:12] this actually Satan is only
[45:16] copying what God is already
[45:20] doing at the day of
[45:23] Pentecost the Holy Spirit fell on the
[45:25] people
[45:27] brother bam says in the same time the
[45:34] Antichrist it was running next to one
[45:38] another every
[45:41] Revival bring forth
[45:43] twins when Jesus was there Judas was
[45:47] there when Cain was there Abel was there
[45:52] is it right they came
[45:54] together abble were born as
[45:59] [Music]
[46:01] twins amen hallelujah hallelujah we just
[46:05] see that we just see that through all
[46:08] the
[46:08] Bible we see it comes as
[46:11] Twins and twins are growing
[46:14] together twins are becoming mature
[46:17] together and what we see now is the
[46:22] Antichrist in its
[46:24] fullness
[46:26] living in the
[46:28] people brother Bram even
[46:31] says it is
[46:33] Satan
[46:37] incarnated not only in one
[46:40] man incarnated in his
[46:46] people
[46:47] Satan
[46:50] incarnated in his
[46:53] people hallelujah hallelujah so is
[46:56] Christ now Christ now Christ now God
[47:02] coming into full
[47:04] view Christ
[47:08] incarnated in his
[47:12] people it is
[47:15] finally Christ walking in
[47:20] them they are not only influenced by the
[47:23] Holy
[47:24] Ghost not only anointed by the Holy
[47:28] Ghost but
[47:30] literally it is Christ the person of the
[47:33] Holy
[47:35] Ghost walking in your
[47:38] [Applause]
[47:40] flesh
[47:42] your living in your
[47:45] being living in your
[47:48] hands it is
[47:51] literally God himself becoming flesh
[47:58] that's right what a change of
[47:59] administration
[48:01] we what we see in the
[48:03] Nations what we see in the world don't
[48:07] hide away in your
[48:10] Hut understand don't run away and hide
[48:14] yourself face the
[48:17] situation because no Hut you can hide
[48:21] in there's no hole you can jump
[48:24] into don't be like an
[48:28] ostrich you know know what he does he
[48:31] puts his he puts his hand in the
[48:37] S not
[48:39] realizing that the biggest part of his
[48:43] body it's still
[48:48] outside
[48:50] canot we have to face those
[48:54] things don't excuse
[48:58] yourself you just come from
[49:01] Uganda don't excuse
[49:03] yourself that you are too
[49:06] simple don't excuse yourself that you
[49:09] are too
[49:10] young don't excuse
[49:13] yourself who you
[49:15] are there is a
[49:17] maturity that is taking place right
[49:19] now there's a change of
[49:22] administration that is taking place
[49:24] today
[49:26] and we have to face that
[49:29] reality this is what Christ is doing
[49:32] today where is Christ today where is he
[49:36] today where is he do you believe he's
[49:40] here at that day at that day which is
[49:44] this day you shall know that I in the
[49:49] Father the father in me I in you and you
[49:54] in me
[49:56] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[49:58] hallelujah this is
[50:00] more than the baptism of the Holy
[50:04] Ghost this is more than just to be
[50:08] baptized with the Holy
[50:11] Ghost as Paul would say the baptism of
[50:15] the Holy Ghost is the down
[50:20] payment did he say
[50:23] that it's a down payment
[50:26] and all of you
[50:28] know when you have the down
[50:30] payments you still
[50:33] need the
[50:39] rest amen and the down
[50:42] payment is only a part of the
[50:45] price it's not the full
[50:48] price but now he himself
[50:51] came the full price
[50:54] came
[50:56] this is why brother Ram could say the
[50:59] baptism of the Holy
[51:01] Ghost do we agree that we need
[51:06] justification we need
[51:08] justification do we agree we need
[51:12] sanctification without
[51:15] Holiness nobody can see
[51:17] God don't
[51:19] allow Satan to delude
[51:24] sanctification
[51:26] [Music]
[51:27] don't
[51:29] delute
[51:34] justification amen don't delude
[51:38] that with your own
[51:42] Works Martin Luther said the just shall
[51:47] live by
[51:49] faith don't delute that don't let a cath
[51:53] don't let a Catholic Spirit come in
[51:58] that to try to earn your
[52:02] salvation amen you cannot
[52:04] earn you cannot
[52:07] earn your good works is an
[52:11] appreciation for what God has done for
[52:14] you not what he will do for
[52:17] you you cannot make God love you
[52:24] more
[52:26] if you from
[52:28] Tomorrow only
[52:30] fasting and praying to the end of your
[52:35] life God don't love you
[52:43] more amen he loved you when you were in
[52:50] sin and his love for
[52:54] you
[52:56] increasing and cannot
[53:00] [Applause]
[53:01] decrease because his love is
[53:06] elective so whatever you
[53:08] do however you serve the
[53:11] Lord we should do it because we love him
[53:16] because we know what he has done for
[53:20] us
[53:22] amen so we should not dilute
[53:27] water down water
[53:32] down never water down
[53:36] sanctification we should never dilute
[53:39] water down baptism of the Holy
[53:43] [Music]
[53:48] Ghost amen but as the prophet would say
[53:54] justification for
[53:56] sanctification and everybody can say
[54:01] Amen way for
[54:04] sanctification
[54:07] sanctification without you being
[54:10] Sanctified sorry you get me better
[54:12] now sanctify
[54:15] sanctification makes the way for the
[54:19] Holy Ghost to
[54:21] come because he cannot fill a dirty
[54:26] vessel he cannot
[54:29] fill a dirty
[54:35] vessel that's how brother could say and
[54:39] he cannot really
[54:42] stify oh I trust you get
[54:45] that first is
[54:50] justification and
[54:52] justification real justification
[54:56] makes a way for
[55:00] sanctification real
[55:03] sanctification and I want to tell you
[55:06] don't try to perfect your
[55:12] body
[55:14] sanctification is not trying to perfect
[55:17] your
[55:21] flesh you cannot perfect your body
[55:26] that's why he
[55:27] [Music]
[55:29] died if you could perfect your
[55:32] body he died he died in
[55:37] vain so you understand what real
[55:39] sanctification
[55:42] is and
[55:44] justification get that
[55:47] church
[55:49] justification makes way for real
[55:54] sanctification
[55:56] hallelujah hallelujah how many people we
[55:59] have today on
[56:00] Earth they live in
[56:03] monasteries they live in
[56:07] monasteries they never go in the
[56:10] world they spent their whole
[56:13] life behind
[56:17] walls is it
[56:19] right trying to get away not be
[56:22] influenced by the
[56:23] world living a Sanctified
[56:28] life and at the end of their
[56:31] Road it helps them
[56:36] [Applause]
[56:37] nothing
[56:39] because they don't see
[56:42] justification they are trying to
[56:45] earn with their
[56:49] lifestyle to
[56:50] earn eternal life who is their lifestyle
[56:56] you cannot earn eternal life with your
[57:04] lifestyle eternal
[57:06] life is granted to
[57:09] you on the
[57:11] basis of God's Sovereign
[57:15] Grace Jacob have I loved Jacob have I
[57:20] love have I
[57:23] hated
[57:26] hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so you
[57:29] see as brother B was placing
[57:32] it justification made a way for
[57:37] sanctification hallelujah hallelujah
[57:41] hallelujah it just opens up to me oh we
[57:44] need
[57:45] justification true
[57:47] justification to really be real
[57:51] Sanctified if really sanctified
[57:55] then it makes a way for the baptism of
[57:57] the Holy
[57:59] Ghost and brother bam says the baptism
[58:02] of the Holy
[58:03] Ghost makes the way
[58:06] now for the Holy Ghost to come
[58:09] himself down in
[58:13] Perfection and that is a change of
[58:17] administration that is a change of
[58:20] administration that we are speaking of
[58:22] this
[58:23] morning there took place a change of
[58:28] administration the baptism of the Holy
[58:30] Ghost prepared the way for a new
[58:36] administrator for the Holy Ghost
[58:40] himself
[58:44] amen hallelujah hallelujah as we see in
[58:47] the as we see with uh with
[58:51] David I don't know if you if you watched
[58:53] that
[58:56] how the whole story
[58:58] started amen how the whole story
[59:02] started oh my oh my oh my my my amen
[59:06] here uh here uh it started actually with
[59:09] the coming of a
[59:13] prophet
[59:15] David's
[59:18] kingship
[59:19] began with the coming of the
[59:23] prophet
[59:25] amen amen is that
[59:28] right hallelujah hallelujah oh I trust
[59:31] we watch that very
[59:33] carefully and you
[59:35] understand so from a young boy's
[59:38] life David became
[59:42] familiar
[59:45] confident with that spiritual
[59:49] administrator his name
[59:52] was Samuel Samu
[59:55] he was the one that came to
[59:58] Bethlehem he was the one anointing
[1:00:03] David is that right it was Samuel the
[1:00:07] prophet so David was not anointing
[1:00:12] himself but he was anointed by a
[1:00:15] prophet he was anointed by a
[1:00:19] messenger came with the
[1:00:21] message that God is changing
[1:00:23] Administration
[1:00:26] he already
[1:00:27] said at that day when David was
[1:00:32] anointed the spirit left
[1:00:37] s and the Spirit came on
[1:00:40] David is that right is that right and
[1:00:44] amazing how David
[1:00:47] behaved you know why David behaved why
[1:00:49] he
[1:00:51] behaved hallelujah hallelujah you know
[1:00:53] why he could stay
[1:00:55] humble because he had an
[1:00:59] administrator his name was
[1:01:02] Samuel that make him to be
[1:01:07] [Applause]
[1:01:09] humble praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:01:12] hallelujah so we need an
[1:01:15] administrator we agree we need an
[1:01:19] administrator yes I can say without a
[1:01:24] prophet
[1:01:25] we will never make
[1:01:31] it hallelujah hallelujah amen am can we
[1:01:35] agree on that it was a
[1:01:38] prophet came to the house of
[1:01:41] Jesse that brought the
[1:01:45] change God did not hand Haden Special
[1:01:48] Angel he used the prophet for
[1:01:51] that and David became conf
[1:01:56] confident with that
[1:02:02] administrator hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:02:05] is an
[1:02:07] administrator
[1:02:09] amen but you know something
[1:02:12] happened that
[1:02:16] administrator
[1:02:21] died Samuel died Sam
[1:02:26] is it right come on
[1:02:30] Church Samuel
[1:02:33] died the one that David was confident
[1:02:39] in that maybe even from time to time
[1:02:42] would counsel
[1:02:46] him he
[1:02:51] died amen amen amen amen but you
[1:02:55] understand God has a
[1:02:59] plan and you cannot tell
[1:03:02] God why did Samuel
[1:03:07] die just at the
[1:03:09] time when David needed him the
[1:03:14] most I tell you
[1:03:16] church as brother BR
[1:03:18] died the whole church the whole message
[1:03:23] round they asked themselves the
[1:03:26] question why did Brother
[1:03:34] Brenham amen why did God allow to take
[1:03:38] him
[1:03:43] away nobody understood
[1:03:46] it but the prophet already had told
[1:03:50] them as Jesus had told the disciples
[1:03:55] long time before his
[1:03:58] departing Jesus had told the
[1:04:01] disci because of you I have to
[1:04:07] go it is expedient for
[1:04:11] you that I
[1:04:13] go because if I don't
[1:04:16] go the Holy Ghost will not
[1:04:21] come change of administration
[1:04:29] that for sure there would be no one in
[1:04:32] the upper
[1:04:35] room I would not go in the upper
[1:04:38] room Jesus would be
[1:04:43] present no need is that right you
[1:04:47] remember the
[1:04:48] story of the feeding of the
[1:04:51] 5,000 Jesus and his disciples
[1:04:55] his disciples told
[1:04:57] Jesus you have preached a little bit too
[1:04:59] long
[1:05:02] today the people are
[1:05:05] angry let them quickly
[1:05:08] go it becomes late transport is
[1:05:13] difficult they need
[1:05:15] food let them go that they can buy
[1:05:19] Foods you know what Jesus says no no no
[1:05:22] no no don't let them go
[1:05:25] it's too late for
[1:05:26] going the shops have already closed so
[1:05:30] they don't need to go make them
[1:05:34] sit and as soon as Jesus said makes them
[1:05:38] sit the discip it's new something is
[1:05:42] going
[1:05:43] on something is good is going to
[1:05:46] happen is it right because we know when
[1:05:49] he
[1:05:51] speaks we know something good is about
[1:05:53] to happen
[1:05:55] if he speaks this
[1:05:57] morning if he speaks this morning we
[1:06:01] know exactly something's good is going
[1:06:03] to
[1:06:06] happen is that right and I believe the
[1:06:09] disciples was
[1:06:11] excited they talked about one another
[1:06:14] have you heard what he said we shall
[1:06:17] make them s oh my
[1:06:20] goodness you can expect the great thing
[1:06:25] and you know what you know what Jesus
[1:06:26] told
[1:06:30] them you know what Jesus told
[1:06:33] them you give them to
[1:06:42] eat is that right this is what Jesus
[1:06:51] said now the disciples said

[1:08:17] one let's take what we
[1:08:20] have and let's
[1:08:22] start
[1:08:24] Jesus told them you feed
[1:08:28] them but because of Jesus was
[1:08:33] there it never fell into their
[1:08:36] heart it fell into their
[1:08:40] head and then they said no he can do it
[1:08:44] much better than
[1:08:48] we come on
[1:08:51] church

[1:10:02] man dispensation is coming fully
[1:10:07] in it means Son of God

[1:10:12] dispensation Fade
[1:10:16] Out you're with
[1:10:18] me hallelujah hallelujah no no no no no
[1:10:21] the Holy Ghost is not gone
[1:10:24] it comes in a more extensive
[1:10:29] way now the entire Holy
[1:10:33] Ghost not just a dip not just a
[1:10:37] bit did Martin Luther had the Holy
[1:10:41] Ghost did Martin Luther had the Holy
[1:10:45] Ghost did he had the same Holy Ghost you
[1:10:48] have there's no two holy
[1:10:52] spirits but he had it in a
[1:10:55] measure that's why he could drink and
[1:10:58] smoke and
[1:11:00] everything he h it in a
[1:11:03] measure but you have
[1:11:06] promised to
[1:11:08] haveit in
[1:11:13] fullness
[1:11:15] all all that God was he poured into
[1:11:20] Christ oh can we say that together
[1:11:27] that God
[1:11:29] was where is it
[1:11:31] today in the
[1:11:34] church and even brother brandham
[1:11:38] said in the
[1:11:44] individual amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:48] amen amen so what the change of
[1:11:52] administration
[1:11:54] that we are living in what a change of
[1:11:58] administration as brother brandham would
[1:12:00] say in the message
[1:12:03] leadership just want to go slowly into
[1:12:05] that
[1:12:07] subject because it's a change of
[1:12:11] administration as it was in David's
[1:12:14] time
[1:12:16] right the change of
[1:12:18] administration and the change of
[1:12:22] administrator and
[1:12:24] as Samuel
[1:12:27] died want you to get
[1:12:30] that Samuel
[1:12:32] dies God had another
[1:12:37] one is that
[1:12:39] right God had another
[1:12:42] one I can give him even a
[1:12:44] name his name was
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:12:50] Nathan but David was not
[1:12:56] confident in the new
[1:13:02] Prophet that's why he get
[1:13:08] distracted and he listened to the
[1:13:13] multitudes he listened to the
[1:13:17] captains because he was not
[1:13:20] confident in the new administrator
[1:13:25] amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so we
[1:13:28] should not get our
[1:13:32] confidence because we are
[1:13:37] many we should not be confident
[1:13:41] today because you have a big group of
[1:13:46] people because the Bible says fear not
[1:13:49] little
[1:13:52] flock amen so our
[1:13:56] confidence should not be how big our
[1:13:58] church
[1:14:01] is our
[1:14:03] confidence should be in
[1:14:08] him hallelujah hallelujah in him should
[1:14:12] be our
[1:14:14] confidence that we are
[1:14:16] confident we say
[1:14:19] administrator what you if you read the
[1:14:22] story
[1:14:24] um as we read 2 Samuel chapter
[1:14:29] 6 so
[1:14:31] David never
[1:14:36] consulted uh
[1:14:42] Na very
[1:14:44] simple because he was not
[1:14:50] confident and Samuel
[1:14:54] was not there
[1:14:56] anymore God had taken in
[1:15:03] the
[1:15:05] Hallelujah God had taken
[1:15:11] Samuel can we say praise the
[1:15:14] lord we see how God is doing
[1:15:17] things and we should
[1:15:19] learn so as as SC
[1:15:24] is taken
[1:15:25] away William
[1:15:28] Branham 60 years
[1:15:34] ago there was a new
[1:15:39] administrator already
[1:15:42] [Music]
[1:15:45] present because brother
[1:15:47] brandham introduced
[1:15:52] him yeah
[1:15:54] yes it was the prophet who told us I
[1:15:59] must
[1:16:00] decrease he must
[1:16:03] increas is that right who is
[1:16:07] he who is
[1:16:10] he who is he it was not the son of man
[1:16:16] Son of God dispensation it was not the
[1:16:18] Son of God
[1:16:21] dispensation now he was introducing the
[1:16:24] son of man
[1:16:30] dispensation amen can we say praise the
[1:16:34] Lord amen so that people become
[1:16:39] confident he said it is him it is our
[1:16:43] Lord up
[1:16:48] there hallelujah hallelujah do we get
[1:16:50] the
[1:16:52] picture
[1:16:54] the change of
[1:16:56] administration that happened in our
[1:16:58] day I ask you the
[1:17:01] question are you
[1:17:04] confident are you
[1:17:07] confident with the new
[1:17:12] administrator do you see him in that
[1:17:18] [Music]
[1:17:20] message hallelujah hallelujah there's
[1:17:23] not a new message
[1:17:25] coming there's not a new man
[1:17:28] coming there's not a eight messenger
[1:17:32] coming Christ
[1:17:34] himself the words the words unveiling
[1:17:43] himself oh I trust you to see what we
[1:17:45] have in our
[1:17:47] hands Hallelujah I trust you see what we
[1:17:50] have in our

[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:18] interesting if you go to second Samuel
[1:18:21] Samuel chapter 7
[1:18:23] [Music]
[1:18:26] you can see that David
[1:18:30] learned David learned from his
[1:18:34] mistake and we should learn from our
[1:18:42] mistakes Hallelujah we should
[1:18:45] learn from something that is not
[1:18:50] working when David saw a dead person
[1:18:53] coming out of
[1:18:55] that he understood something is
[1:18:58] wrong David
[1:19:00] understood I counseled the wrong
[1:19:04] people yes I asked the wrong
[1:19:08] people because David said it's
[1:19:11] impossible when God is in it that we
[1:19:15] have dead people among
[1:19:17] us come on
[1:19:19] church is this
[1:19:21] movement
[1:19:23] there's no debt
[1:19:30] allowed amen David
[1:19:33] understood when Dad is
[1:19:36] here I did something
[1:19:38] wrong when that is here David
[1:19:43] understood something is
[1:19:47] wrong
[1:19:49] amen amen let me say to you
[1:19:54] when spiritual death is
[1:19:58] in natural death is not so
[1:20:03] important spiritual death is much more
[1:20:07] important
[1:20:10] today if you have SE spiritual de
[1:20:15] people with this
[1:20:18] message you know something is
[1:20:21] wrong
[1:20:24] amen you know something is
[1:20:26] wrong and we should understand this
[1:20:30] message this message cannot produce
[1:20:33] spiritual
[1:20:36] death this
[1:20:38] message is
[1:20:41] [Applause]
[1:20:42] life I trust you get
[1:20:45] that where we are going so David
[1:20:49] understood in that time it was natural
[1:20:52] death
[1:20:54] David
[1:20:55] understood that cannot be today is
[1:20:58] spiritual
[1:20:59] death today is spiritual death and it
[1:21:03] cannot be that he is here and people are
[1:21:07] dying
[1:21:10] spiritually people are dying
[1:21:12] spiritually with this
[1:21:14] message we have not we have not
[1:21:17] seen the new
[1:21:21] Administration we just take
[1:21:23] it from William
[1:21:25] Bram but we have to take it this message
[1:21:30] doesn't come from William
[1:21:32] Brenham this message comes from almighty
[1:21:39] God it was sent from the
[1:21:43] father a father William
[1:21:47] Bram William Bram was only a
[1:21:51] tool like elazar was a
[1:21:55] toour but it was Abraham sending forth a
[1:21:59] message was Abraham the
[1:22:02] father Abraham the
[1:22:05] father sending force a
[1:22:08] message to
[1:22:10] elazar as brother Bram hallelujah
[1:22:14] hallelujah brother Bram was not the Holy
[1:22:16] Ghost brother BR was not the son of
[1:22:19] man brother Brenham was just like El
[1:22:24] getting a
[1:22:25] message from the
[1:22:27] father you go out you go out and look
[1:22:31] for a

[1:23:17] himself you're with me the Lord will
[1:23:20] come himself the Lord
[1:23:24] himself shall
[1:23:28] descend is that right so it was not
[1:23:32] elazer making himself a bride trying to
[1:23:36] look somewhere in the place or she
[1:23:40] looks it was not
[1:23:42] elazar amen elazar was not the
[1:23:47] bridegroom Ela is not the
[1:23:51] bridegroom
[1:23:53] it was the
[1:23:55] father understand
[1:23:57] that it is again the
[1:24:00] father is the
[1:24:02] father sending a
[1:24:04] message this message comes from
[1:24:10] God hallelujah hallelujah can we believe
[1:24:13] that hallelujah hallelujah and here

[1:24:40] place go to a certain kind of
[1:24:43] people go to a certain kind of
[1:24:48] people and then brother Bram

[1:24:52] Lord was a half
[1:24:57] hour before elator
[1:25:01] arrived the angel of the Lord
[1:25:07] arrived so before before El

[1:25:15] came God was on the
[1:25:19] scene so it was not actually a is
[1:25:24] looking it was God
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:29] preparing hallelujah hallelujah and then
[1:25:32] elaz came to the place and you remember
[1:25:35] how he
[1:25:36] prayed remember how he prayed he said
[1:25:40] Lord let the first
[1:25:43] damel the first damel that comes
[1:25:46] out and that I ask for a drink of
[1:25:50] water and that and she that shall be a
[1:25:55] sign that shall be the
[1:25:59] sign that shall be the sign that this is
[1:26:01] the
[1:26:02] bride she has to do
[1:26:05] something without
[1:26:07] me telling
[1:26:10] her it has to be God
[1:26:14] himself dealing with
[1:26:19] Rebecca you're with me so you are not
[1:26:23] following just a
[1:26:27] man yet in the
[1:26:30] beginning you follow a
[1:26:33] man that's why Rebecca
[1:26:36] said I Will Follow That
[1:26:39] Man remember in the
[1:26:42] Tabernacle if you go from from the outer
[1:26:45] Court into the holy place to come into
[1:26:49] the holiest of holies
[1:26:53] you have to cross Badger
[1:26:56] skins Come Again Come Again you have to
[1:27:01] cross Bader
[1:27:07] skins you're with me because between the
[1:27:10] holy place and the holies of
[1:27:13] holies there was a
[1:27:16] veil of
[1:27:19] humanity bger skins
[1:27:22] Bader
[1:27:24] skins God has orchestrated
[1:27:27] that so you have to come to that Badger
[1:27:32] skin in order to go into the
[1:27:39] holy is that right yes yes but you never
[1:27:44] stop with the Bader
[1:27:46] skins if you come to the badges
[1:27:49] skins you cannot say I'm there
[1:27:53] coming to
[1:27:55] Eleazar Rebecca could not say I'm
[1:27:58] there said no I'm not the bright
[1:28:02] group I'm just the
[1:28:06] veil you with me but once if you can
[1:28:11] break through the
[1:28:14] veil of
[1:28:16] humanity you see who wel Brenham really
[1:28:21] was because the badger
[1:28:24] skin is
[1:28:26] failing the Hol of
[1:28:29] holies from the
[1:28:31] outside not only with
[1:28:34] brandham not only with the
[1:28:37] messengers that's the same with you you
[1:28:40] bger
[1:28:41] skin your flesh is
[1:28:48] veiling who you really are
[1:28:54] can you understand
[1:28:56] that we are not going into the holies of
[1:28:59] holies
[1:29:00] just we are a
[1:29:03] part of the holiest of
[1:29:06] [Applause]
[1:29:09] holiest hallelujah
[1:29:15] hallelujah change of administration is
[1:29:18] happening come on Church wake up what a
[1:29:22] change of
[1:29:27] administration hallelujah
[1:29:31] hallelujah amen and he was
[1:29:34] eleazer outside
[1:29:37] praying now Rebecca came out she was the
[1:29:41] first
[1:29:42] damsel or maybe she was not even the
[1:29:45] first maybe she was the
[1:29:47] first but he asked the
[1:29:50] question let the first
[1:29:53] stel that comes out and which I asked to
[1:29:57] drink and then she gives me to
[1:30:00] drink and then she will feed the
[1:30:03] camels but I will not tell
[1:30:07] her that will be the
[1:30:10] sign so elaz said this is not my
[1:30:15] choice it must be the
[1:30:18] Lord and as Rebecca came out
[1:30:22] I believe she was also the
[1:30:24] first but even if she would be the
[1:30:27] second
[1:30:31] imaginea would ask the
[1:30:34] first give can you give me to drink and
[1:30:37] the one said yes you look like a
[1:30:41] very you thirsty person I will give you
[1:30:45] to drink thank you very much okay God
[1:30:49] bless
[1:30:50] you
[1:30:52] knew that's not the
[1:31:00] bride but now Rebecca comes
[1:31:04] out maybe she was the first one
[1:31:08] yes but just not really in numbers the
[1:31:11] first
[1:31:12] one but she was the first
[1:31:15] one that he asked for a
[1:31:17] drink and as he asked for a
[1:31:20] drink she
[1:31:23] said she
[1:31:25] said I will not only give you but you
[1:31:29] canel also look very
[1:31:31] thirsty I will also feed your
[1:31:34] camel and as she said that he said
[1:31:38] praise the
[1:31:42] Lord
[1:31:44] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:31:47] you understand
[1:31:50] that behind everything was the
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:56] father
[1:31:58] Abraham Abraham was guilty of
[1:32:02] that Abraham was guilty of that
[1:32:07] all and now she's asked the question you
[1:32:11] understand when I say
[1:32:12] that amen God is behind that
[1:32:19] all Hallelujah
[1:32:22] [Applause]

[1:32:27] don't finish what we want to
[1:32:31] do come on
[1:32:33] chur so the sign of being the
[1:32:37] bride was asking an extra
[1:32:44] work to
[1:32:47] feed the
[1:32:50] animals those those
[1:32:52] animals would bring her finally
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:33:01] back so you are not saying Amen to the
[1:33:07] minister you are not saying Amen to the
[1:33:12] messenger you're not saying just Amen to
[1:33:15] William
[1:33:17] branon was not just saying Amen to
[1:33:19] William Brandon
[1:33:22] right was saying
[1:33:24] Amen to the Holy Ghost
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:30] himself that's why as she
[1:33:32] said this is nothing but the
[1:33:36] truth she did not say it just to William
[1:33:40] Brandon she said it to the one that was
[1:33:43] higher than William
[1:33:46] BR that's why there's a higher authority
[1:33:50] present
[1:33:52] who told the
[1:33:54] prophets tell
[1:33:56] her whatever she
[1:33:59] asked you understand
[1:34:01] that William Brandon was not the
[1:34:04] administrator he was the
[1:34:08] administrator the mighty one was the
[1:34:11] administrator
[1:34:13] yes trust we get
[1:34:16] that brother Brandon could not say
[1:34:19] whatever you want it was he
[1:34:23] himself said whatever she
[1:34:25] was give it
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:31] her can we see the new
[1:34:36] Administration right being a part of
[1:34:44] it hallelujah hallelujah the bride being
[1:34:48] a part of
[1:34:50] it it was was not the administrator
[1:34:56] speaking it was not the
[1:34:59] administrator speaking to the sons of
[1:35:02] hetti
[1:35:04] right it was not the
[1:35:08] administrator speaking to the
[1:35:11] squirrels it was William
[1:35:14] brandham speaking to the
[1:35:18] squirrel is that right you get the
[1:35:22] picture

[1:35:26] carefully that is the new
[1:35:29] Administration we have to become
[1:35:31] confident

[1:52:54] man I am a son of man revealing
[1:53:01] [Applause]
[1:53:05] the as brother brandham would
[1:53:08] say as long as you are building a
[1:53:12] wall it's all
[1:53:15] fine everyone can do
[1:53:17] that to build a wall
[1:53:21] but God don't want just a wall to be
[1:53:26] built he would ask the
[1:53:29] question what
[1:53:30] house do you build
[1:53:33] me
[1:53:34] hallelujah what house is being
[1:53:37] built so this God is not building a
[1:53:41] wall he is orchestrating a
[1:53:44] house a
[1:53:48] temple
[1:53:50] hallelujah hallelujah and the last
[1:53:52] thing the last
[1:53:55] thing that comes to finish up the
[1:53:59] temple is The
[1:54:04] Headstone hallelujah hallelujah that's

[1:54:12] straight way it's all
[1:54:15] fine The Brick Layers can do right down
[1:54:18] the road
[1:54:20] but when you have to turn the
[1:54:22] corner that's where the time and we are
[1:54:25] not building a
[1:54:26] wall we are building a house you see
[1:54:30] these turns has to come they come in the

[1:54:55] him this is not just William brandham
[1:54:58] speaking this is the one Speaking who is
[1:55:01] the
[1:55:03] Builder because God told
[1:55:06] David you are not building me a
[1:55:09] house Solomon is not just building me a
[1:55:13] house but God said to
[1:55:15] David I will build you a
[1:55:18] house

[1:56:03] Corner when you see when you turn the
[1:56:06] last corner of a
[1:56:09] house nothing else is
[1:56:13] left then the roof to come
[1:56:17] down Hallelujah
[1:56:20] nothing else is
[1:56:22] left so the last Corner that will be
[1:56:27] turned is not for making another
[1:56:32] wall but the last turn of the that is
[1:56:37] made is now for The Headstone to come
[1:56:41] down that is the last turn of the
[1:56:46] house if the words are finished
[1:56:50] have the last
[1:56:52] turn you see it's

[1:56:58] turn hallelujah hallelujah the last
[1:57:02] turn is to look
[1:57:04] up your Redemption draws
[1:57:11] now hallelujah
[1:57:13] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah then
[1:57:16] brother R said in birth
[1:57:18] pains
[1:57:21] amen he said we are not building a
[1:57:25] wall start of his Luther's
[1:57:27] message ly on the Pentecost message we
[1:57:31] are turning
[1:57:33] Corners we are building a
[1:57:36] building and it's a prophet's
[1:57:38] Age and and they turn those
[1:57:41] Corners made those
[1:57:44] different but the builders wanted to
[1:57:46] build a
[1:57:48] wall but it is a
[1:57:50] building the building of
[1:57:53] God in another quote brother Ram
[1:57:56] said he said we had those
[1:57:59] Specialists we had those
[1:58:02] Specialists
[1:58:04] Luther specialist
[1:58:07] Wesley do you believe Luther turned a
[1:58:11] corner the
[1:58:13] just shall live by
[1:58:18] faith absolutely
[1:58:21] ET then Wesley came another specialist
[1:58:27] brother the
[1:58:29] Pentecost is it not
[1:58:31] amazing watch very
[1:58:34] carefully that brother said
[1:58:37] lther
[1:58:38] Wesley and then
[1:58:45] Pentecost is it not
[1:58:48] amazing
[1:58:50] he said Luther
[1:58:52] h w
[1:58:55] h and Pentecostal
[1:58:58] H you know what the the church age of
[1:59:01] Martin Luther's name
[1:59:03] [Music]
[1:59:09] wasis Wesley was
[1:59:13] Philadelphia and then we had the
[1:59:15] Pentecostal
[1:59:17] age which is the lene age
[1:59:22] is it not
[1:59:23] amazing brother said
[1:59:26] Luther wle Luther was a
[1:59:31] specialist Wesley was a
[1:59:34] specialist and then he said
[1:59:40] Pentecost why is he doing
[1:59:45] that he had to
[1:59:47] say BR him
[1:59:52] is a
[2:00:00] specialist right because William Martin
[2:00:05] Luther he was the
[2:00:07] messenger of the church
[2:00:10] age and that's why brother said Luther
[2:00:12] was the
[2:00:15] specialist Wesley was the messenger to
[2:00:19] that church age and brother said Wesley
[2:00:22] was that
[2:00:23] specialist now when he came to the
[2:00:25] Pentecost age of the Lan
[2:00:29] church he had to say William Bram was
[2:00:33] that
[2:00:36] specialist but the prophet if he's a
[2:00:40] true
[2:00:42] prophet he never puts himself in the
[2:00:48] picture
[2:00:50] but it was the last
[2:00:53] star in the hand of
[2:00:57] God Adam was the latest edition that
[2:01:03] [Music]
[2:01:05] came naming all other species before
[2:01:12] him so the last angel that was in the
[2:01:15] hand of
[2:01:17] God was giv to give names to all the
[2:01:21] other and when it came to his own
[2:01:24] name he had to keep
[2:01:27] silence no prophets no man is projecting
[2:01:31] [Music]
[2:01:34] himself can you say Amen to that what's
[2:01:37] William Bram the messenger to the line
[2:01:45] churches amen amen now bring that quote
[2:01:50] again bring the quote
[2:01:56] again that's because I really want you
[2:01:58] to get
[2:02:00] something that we see with a change of
[2:02:04] administration remember how how David
[2:02:07] was not
[2:02:11] confident as you read at home 2 Samuel
[2:02:15] [Music]
[2:02:17] 7 it is about the temple
[2:02:21] worship right Solomon wanted to build a
[2:02:25] temple actually David he wanted to make
[2:02:28] a
[2:02:29] temple is that
[2:02:31] right amen and then suddenly naan is
[2:02:36] with
[2:02:38] David Nathan is actually telling David
[2:02:44] finally you don't build the temple
[2:02:47] David God told me to tell you your son
[2:02:52] Solomon
[2:02:57] will oh my oh my oh my if we had time we
[2:03:00] would go into
[2:03:02] that if
[2:03:04] David would not be confident by
[2:03:09] now in the new
[2:03:13] administrator he would ask again the
[2:03:17] public and then he would would have
[2:03:19] probably build a
[2:03:23] temple you with me but God says you are
[2:03:27] not the man to build the temple because
[2:03:30] you have too many blood on your
[2:03:33] fingers is that right David would have
[2:03:36] made the next
[2:03:40] mistake but now he was
[2:03:44] confident with
[2:03:46] Nathan now he asked Nathan
[2:03:49] what shall I do
[2:03:52] Nan and then God could
[2:03:56] speak through the new new
[2:03:59] administrator hallelujah hallelujah and
[2:04:02] David became a part of that
[2:04:06] administ trust you can
[2:04:11] follow message go right down the straet
[2:04:14] then and anybody can run a straight line
[2:04:16] but it takes amazing to the corner it
[2:04:19] takes the power of God to to have to

[2:17:22] ready to say we follow that
[2:17:27] man because we
[2:17:29] know where he leads us
[2:17:32] to he leads us to the second
[2:17:37] Adam the entire Holy
[2:17:40] Ghost the son of man Christ himself the
[2:17:46] bridegroom
[2:17:50] intelligence Hallelujah Hallelujah
[2:17:52] Hallelujah the
[2:17:55] heads
[2:17:57] Hallelujah quickly go through
[2:18:01] it um to show
[2:18:05] plainly that Paul did not
[2:18:09] came at the end of
[2:18:16] Ephesus
[2:18:18] I want to let really let that sink
[2:18:22] now Paul did not
[2:18:25] came the end of
[2:18:27] Ephesus yet he was the
[2:18:30] messenger to the church age of
[2:18:35] Ephesus is that right I also showed you
[2:18:39] this Paul was
[2:18:42] born in
[2:18:44] 10 after the birth of Christ
[2:18:48] and he died in 67
[2:18:55] ad you can you can find it
[2:18:58] out that's what the historical
[2:19:02] is Paul was born one
[2:19:04] day like
[2:19:06] you and Paul died one
[2:19:09] day so he was born in 10
[2:19:13] ad and he died in 67 ad
[2:19:21] and he didn't
[2:19:22] came at the end of
[2:19:29] Ephesus
[2:19:31] amen
[2:19:33] amen we let that
[2:19:37] sink brother said Luther came end at the
[2:19:42] end of the Jewish
[2:19:46] dispensation Paul
[2:19:48] Paul Paul came at the end of the Jewish
[2:19:52] [Music]
[2:19:55] time you're with
[2:19:58] me see the
[2:20:00] principle that will help you to be more
[2:20:06] confident is what this message really
[2:20:10] is this message is not a message of
[2:20:12] William
[2:20:14] brandham this message is the message of
[2:20:17] God
[2:20:19] this is not the unveiling of William
[2:20:23] Brandon this is the unveiling of
[2:20:28] God
[2:20:30] Christ is the
[2:20:32] mystery of
[2:20:34] God
[2:20:36] revealed what was the mystery behind
[2:20:42] Christ what was his
[2:20:44] mystery his mystery was that he was
[2:20:51] God he was unveiling God is that
[2:20:55] right so Christ was the mystery of
[2:21:00] God and the mystery of Christ was
[2:21:05] God the bride is the
[2:21:08] mystery of
[2:21:10] Christ
[2:21:12] revealed what is the mystery of the
[2:21:16] Bride of the
[2:21:18] bright is
[2:21:23] God hallelujah hallelujah because head
[2:21:27] and
[2:21:28] body
[2:21:32] Hallelujah according to
[2:21:35] scripture the one that
[2:21:39] sanctifies and the one that are
[2:21:45] Sanctified are of the
[2:21:49] same at scripture Paul is tell I think
[2:21:53] Paul is telling us
[2:21:54] this the one that
[2:21:58] sanctifies which is Christ and the one
[2:22:02] that are
[2:22:03] Sanctified that's me are all of
[2:22:10] God so the mystery behind
[2:22:13] Christ was God and the Mystery behind
[2:22:17] the
[2:22:19] church is God
[2:22:25] again hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:22:28] hallelujah can we say praise the
[2:22:31] Lord just to I do
[2:22:34] that so we become
[2:22:37] confident with a new
[2:22:42] administrator because if we become
[2:22:45] confident like David
[2:22:47] became confident with
[2:22:50] na that helped him in his life in his
[2:22:57] [Music]

[2:37:59] Elijah of the Old
[2:38:01] Testament what did the Lord told him

[2:38:07] than an Old Testament
[2:38:13] Prophet is that right
[2:38:17] hallelujah hallelujah total
[2:38:20] confidence in this
[2:38:22] message because I know how to
[2:38:25] [Music]
[2:38:30] read you remember the
[2:38:33] story of a man he was so excited about
[2:38:37] the
[2:38:38] message or so excited about the
[2:38:41] Bible so excited about the message and
[2:38:45] he went went to his
[2:38:46] boss and he said boss you must read this
[2:38:51] read it the Bible the message is so
[2:38:57] wonderful so the boss said okay give it
[2:38:59] to me I
[2:39:01] read so after a week the boss came back
[2:39:05] to the
[2:39:06] worker you can have it
[2:39:11] back why
[2:39:14] boss
[2:39:16] I was reading
[2:39:17] it he was always calling me Buzzard Buzz
[2:39:31] Buzzard the brother said
[2:39:34] strange I read the same
[2:39:38] book and he's calling me Eagle all the
[2:39:44] time
[2:39:48] how do we
[2:39:52] read how readest
[2:39:55] [Applause]

[2:40:03] thou
[2:40:05] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah this is
[2:40:08] what this message
[2:40:10] is that's why brother Ram did not get
[2:40:14] confused he had the
[2:40:17] potentials to be
[2:40:21] confused
[2:40:23] yes you see in his
[2:40:25] life he had the
[2:40:28] potentials to be confused like John the

[2:41:07] confused but I cannot be
[2:41:11] confused you know why
[2:41:13] not because I have a different
[2:41:18] Ministry that's why the
[2:41:20] brides cannot
[2:41:23] fall yet she has the potential of
[2:41:27] falling but she cannot fall because she
[2:41:31] has a

[2:50:07] king needed another
[2:50:13] queen that right
[2:50:16] and here we see
[2:50:18] hay the type of the
[2:50:21] Prophet telling
[2:50:24] Esther what it needs to become
[2:50:29] bright that time Esther is chosen to be
[2:50:32] the

[2:50:41] confident with her new administrator
[2:50:47] [Music]
[2:50:49] she don't know the
[2:50:51] king
[2:50:53] yet do you know why Eve is

[2:51:43] confident she was not confident and then
[2:51:46] we see
[2:51:48] mukai the type of the Holy
[2:51:51] Spirit moving into the
[2:51:54] church today the holy spirit is moving
[2:51:57] into the

[2:52:51] are and then
[2:52:53] Esther was praying for
[2:52:57] Revelation this is what brother random
[2:52:59] said this is what the church should pray
[2:53:03] for more than before our daily
[2:53:05] Foods more than for anything else we
[2:53:09] should pray for
