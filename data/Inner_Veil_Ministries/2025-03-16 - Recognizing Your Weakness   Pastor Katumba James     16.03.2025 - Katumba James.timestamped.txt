[29:03] tell
[29:04] Jesus amen amen let us stand up and take
[29:07] a scripture
[29:13] reading we're going to
[29:16] read in Psalms
[29:22] 32 from verse 1 to verse 8
[29:33] okay before we read us
[29:35] again father again we approach your
[29:38] throne of grace and
[29:40] mercy and Sur we are here to tell you
[29:43] all our burdens and
[29:46] TRS for you care in
[29:50] everything and now we got the opening of
[29:52] the
[29:53] word you've Tau us heavenly
[29:56] father that the word did not come by the
[29:59] desire of
[30:01] man but the holy men of God we are moved
[30:05] by the Holy
[30:07] Spirit and you also Tau Us in this end
[30:11] time that you interpret your own
[30:14] word you therefore come and interpret us
[30:17] your
[30:18] word according to the STS we
[30:21] have and also what we have need of that
[30:25] you may speak to us personally
[30:28] and help each and every one of us to
[30:31] have a personal relationship with
[30:34] you that can be better than it has ever
[30:37] been
[30:38] before we love you and we thank you Lord
[30:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus and ask
[30:44] this amen so Psalms
[30:48] 32 we're reading in verse
[30:53] one I had forgotten also brother Henry
[30:56] is in IMA Henry M
[30:59] so so just keep him in your
[31:02] prayers amen so Psalms
[31:06] 32 verse 1 to verse
[31:09] 8 says blessed is he whose transgression
[31:13] Is Forgiven whose sin is
[31:22] covered blessed is the man unto whom the
[31:25] Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose
[31:28] Spirit there is no
[31:42] gu when I kept silence my bones worked
[31:46] out through my roaring all day long
[32:00] for day and night thy hand was Heavy
[32:03] upon me
[32:20] my for this shall everyone that is Godly
[32:24] pray unto thee in a time when th found
[32:28] surely in the floods of Great Waters
[32:31] they shall not come nigh unto
[32:54] him though at my Hiding Place Thou shalt
[32:58] preserve me from travel thou shal
[33:01] Compass me about with songs of
[33:03] Deliverance
[33:18] Sarah I will instruct thee and teach
[33:22] thee in the way which Thou shalt go I'll
[33:25] guide thee with mine eye
[33:42] verse what may seated so I want to
[33:47] preach on the
[33:49] subject recognizing your
[33:53] weakness praise the name of the Lord
[33:56] recognizing your
[33:59] weakness and it is actually very
[34:03] important for each and every one of
[34:07] us to know our
[34:10] weaknesses praise the name of our Lord
[34:12] in one way or
[34:14] another you find yourself there is
[34:19] weakness there is something that is not
[34:21] adding
[34:22] up there is something that is not
[34:25] right there is something that you're not
[34:28] happy with in your
[34:30] life there's something that actually you
[34:33] know like frustrates
[34:37] you praise the name of our Lord so here
[34:40] in verse
[34:42] five David
[34:44] says I acknowledge my sin unto
[34:50] thee and my
[34:53] iniquity I not
[34:55] H I said I will confess my
[34:59] transgressions unto the
[35:03] Lord and th forgest the iniquity of my
[35:10] sin praise the name of our Lord he said
[35:13] I will acknowledge my
[35:15] sin I will not hide it but I will tell
[35:19] say Lord this is my area
[35:23] of Lord this is where I
[35:26] fa Lord this is where I'm beaten
[35:29] down that's why David was confessing
[35:32] that I will not
[35:34] hide my iniquity but I will acknowledge
[35:39] it I will say it is me who has done
[35:43] this it's me Lord who has a
[35:46] problem it's me Lord among
[35:51] us it's me who hates
[35:54] another it's me who has a bad spirit
[35:58] it's me who has a bad heart it's me who
[36:02] steals it's me who does
[36:05] prostitution it's me who
[36:08] drinks it's me who does this words you
[36:11] are acknowledging it before
[36:14] God when you acknowledge it before God
[36:17] and cry Lord have mercy
[36:21] upon praise the name of our Lord
[36:23] recognizing our
[36:25] weaknesses before the Lord
[36:28] and then you call upon the name of the
[36:31] Lord Lord help me in this
[36:34] area Lord there is a challenge I have in
[36:36] my
[36:37] life I want you to come in this area and
[36:41] then work upon
[36:43] it mold me praise the name of our Lord
[36:47] in the way that is pleasing unto
[36:50] you praise the name of our Lord so then
[36:52] the Bible says I will not hide my
[36:56] iniquity
[36:58] but I will
[37:00] confess by transgression to the Lord and
[37:05] when you confess to the Lord then the
[37:08] Bible says then the Lord forgives
[37:11] you praise the name of the the Lord
[37:14] forgives you praise the name of our Lord
[37:18] but then you see where the challenge
[37:19] comes
[37:20] in is when you hide your
[37:23] sin when you hide your weakness and you
[37:27] are not able to declare it before the
[37:29] Lord and then you tell Lord this is my
[37:32] weakness Lord this is my failure and you
[37:36] know genine
[37:37] [Music]
[37:38] repentance is you know to come and tell
[37:40] God about
[37:43] yourself praise the name of our Lord
[37:45] like David when David went and committed
[37:50] adultery and then he
[37:52] murdered and then the prophet came to
[37:55] David and told David that you are the
[37:59] man David did not just start kind of
[38:03] doing something
[38:05] else he admitted his
[38:08] weaknesses he admitted his sin and said
[38:12] Lord surely I am the
[38:14] man whatever you are saying is the
[38:17] truth everything you've talked about me
[38:20] like the woman at the word he said he
[38:23] has told me
[38:25] everything and that's the simp bis when
[38:28] we come to the Lord you know you don't
[38:31] come to hide
[38:32] anything because the Lord knows
[38:35] everything so you're not doing well to
[38:38] hide anything from God now when you come
[38:41] before the Lord you declare your
[38:44] condition so Lord I'm not good here Lord
[38:48] I have a weakness here Lord I have a
[38:50] failure here so let us go to Psalms
[38:54] 51 praise the name of our Lord and then
[38:58] verse
[38:59] one the Bible
[39:02] says to the chief musician a of David
[39:06] when Nathan the prophet came unto him
[39:09] after he had gone into
[39:13] BBA may not have those words but just
[39:26] interpret then David says have mercy
[39:29] upon me oh
[39:32] God according to thy loving
[39:37] kindness according to the m of thy
[39:40] Tender
[39:41] Mercies BL out my
[39:46] transgression you know you see how David
[39:48] is approaching the
[39:49] Lord Lord surely I'm the
[39:53] problem Sur I'm the one who has
[39:55] committed adter
[39:57] the one who has
[39:59] murdered so have mercy upon you then he
[40:03] says wash me thary from my
[40:08] iniquity and cleanse
[40:11] me from my
[40:15] sin praise the name of our Lord he
[40:17] calling upon the name of the Lord says
[40:20] lord I can't help
[40:23] myself I can't deliver myself out of
[40:26] this so I'm depending upon your grace to
[40:30] come and deliver me out of my weakness
[40:35] come and deliver me out of blood
[40:40] guilt then inse three
[40:44] acknowledges he's
[40:46] confessing he's
[40:48] recognizing his weakness says for I
[40:51] acknowledge my
[40:55] transgression and my sin is ever before
[41:00] me your weakness before
[41:02] you bring it to the Lord said Lord this
[41:06] is my
[41:08] weakness this is my
[41:10] failure this is my sin Lord acknowledge
[41:15] it Lord this is where I
[41:19] fail this is where I am
[41:23] limited then he then he says acknowledge
[41:26] my sin
[41:28] my sin is ever before
[41:31] me against you and you only have I
[41:37] seen and done this evil in your
[41:41] sight that you may be
[41:45] justified when you speak and be
[41:49] clear when you
[41:52] judge saying
[41:54] nothing whatever you are saying is
[41:56] correct
[41:58] praise the name of you know David a king
[42:02] he humbled
[42:04] himself and when the prophet came to the
[42:07] king and told the king his
[42:11] problem David never started arguing with
[42:14] the
[42:16] K he never started saying don't you know
[42:18] that I'm a man after God's
[42:22] Own don't you know that God anointed
[42:25] me by a great proph
[42:28] called who are to come
[42:31] to that was not David praise the name of
[42:35] you know he had a heart like the heart
[42:37] of
[42:38] God you know he said Lord this is my
[42:43] transgression this is my sin I admit my
[42:48] weaknesses and you see that's what the
[42:51] Lord wants us also to
[42:53] do to admit our weaknesses
[42:58] recognize our
[43:00] failures and say Lord this is where I'm
[43:03] failing Lord this is the
[43:06] condition that bothers me praise the
[43:09] name of our David he never argued with
[43:12] the
[43:13] prophet but then when you read in some
[43:16] scriptures you find that when a king is
[43:19] told of his
[43:22] weakness they they kind of punish that
[43:26] Prophet but but to David it was not
[43:29] so a man with a right
[43:32] heart and should also be the same thing
[43:35] with us that when the word of God
[43:38] identifies our weak
[43:40] areas you said Lord have mercy upon
[43:44] Min praise the name of our Lord you
[43:46] don't take it to be against the
[43:49] minister why is it talking against me
[43:53] why is it spoiling my
[43:55] name why is it that I do this and
[43:59] this if it is true you do it say Lord
[44:03] have mer
[44:04] supp praise the name of our lord it's
[44:07] not good that we hide our
[44:10] sins it's not good that we hide our
[44:14] weaknesses but then you bring it before
[44:16] the Lord and ask the mercies of God come
[44:21] in your
[44:22] weakness to come in your
[44:25] area and that's how you can be
[44:28] helped that's how you can be
[44:32] delivered praise the name of our Lord in
[44:34] Proverbs
[44:37] 28 and then
[44:41] verse3 the Bible
[44:43] says he that covers his sins shall not
[44:47] Prosper but soever confesses and
[44:50] forsakes them Shall Have
[44:55] Mercy 18 28 verse
[45:14] 13 verse 14
[45:28] praise the name of our Lord so he says
[45:31] he that covers his
[45:34] sin shall not
[45:37] Prosper so you don't cover your
[45:40] sins you don't cover your
[45:43] weakness so you bring it and confess it
[45:46] before the Lord and say Lord this is my
[45:49] area
[45:50] of Lord this is where I'm
[45:53] failing Lord this is where the devil is
[45:55] holding me down
[45:58] praise the name of our Lord whenever I
[46:00] get my
[46:01] phone and I have dat on my phone I go to
[46:05] bad
[46:06] things and I take time on bad
[46:10] things Facebook or Tik Tok or
[46:15] YouTube you know feeding things which
[46:17] are not
[46:18] right that's your weakness so then you
[46:22] declare it before the Lord no this is
[46:25] the problem that
[46:27] most of my
[46:28] time I spend it on
[46:31] L most of my time I spend it on
[46:36] backbiting most of my time I spend it on
[46:39] abusing
[46:41] others most of my time I spend it
[46:44] despising
[46:46] others most of my time I spend it seeing
[46:50] how I can frustrate
[46:53] others you know you declare it to the
[46:55] Lord and say Lord this is the point he
[46:59] has Mercy other words when I
[47:03] confess like David I have committed
[47:07] adultery I have murdered he confessed
[47:12] and
[47:13] for and that should be the same thing
[47:16] praise the name of our Lord if I know my
[47:19] weakness is
[47:21] ring praise the name of our Lord you
[47:23] know Spirits keep on attracting one
[47:25] another
[47:27] when brother Bram would identify a
[47:29] certain
[47:31] disease in a particular person when he
[47:35] Discerning then he would see
[47:39] darkness in the different parts of the
[47:42] congregation demons calling to one
[47:45] another to defend this one here say that
[47:48] this one doesn't leave and then now when
[47:51] he sees that kind of
[47:52] situation then he tells all the
[47:55] people people with you know you know
[47:58] maybe this kind of
[48:00] condition stand up on your feet then
[48:03] cast out that
[48:05] demon so now you find that somebody who
[48:07] has an evil spirit
[48:10] in that evil spirit in you will identify
[48:14] another person with the same evil
[48:17] spirit and you find you become friends
[48:19] with that
[48:21] person cuz you're feeding from the same
[48:24] thing
[48:26] is
[48:28] rering your best friend is a
[48:32] Rumer then you can just get and each
[48:35] each and every person brings
[48:38] more other brings this the other brings
[48:41] this other BRS other and then time
[48:45] goes so then you need to see that you
[48:47] forsake
[48:49] that if you know this person is
[48:53] Rong and I want to overcome Rong
[48:57] avoid Fellowship
[49:01] on praise the name of our Lord not
[49:04] asking have you had
[49:06] this you have not had there also this
[49:10] also brings another so you
[49:14] confess and
[49:16] forsake praise the name of our Lord if
[49:19] the weakness is going to the
[49:21] bar there's a particular friend of yours
[49:24] who called you to go to the bar
[49:28] then you know that I have to cut off
[49:30] contact with this
[49:32] person I have to cut off contact going
[49:35] to such a
[49:37] place you know you are
[49:40] forsaking you are you are actually the
[49:42] Bible
[49:43] says let us go to first Thessalonians
[49:45] chapter
[49:48] 5 praise the name of our Lord first
[49:51] thians chapter
[49:54] 5 and then we go to ver
[49:57] let me get the verse
[50:02] here we go to verse
[50:06] 20 we go to verse
[50:10] 22 okay start from verse
[50:13] 20 it says prove all
[50:19] things hold first that which is
[50:24] good says proof
[50:28] all things if it is not good leave it if
[50:33] it is good says hold it then verse 22
[50:38] abstain from all appearance of
[50:44] evil
[50:46] appearance of evil you've not done it
[50:51] you've not got into it but when you know
[50:54] that there's something evil there
[50:58] avoid praise the name of our Lord avoid
[51:01] it you know they are like now sometimes
[51:04] an example is
[51:06] this maybe at school or at University or
[51:10] at place of
[51:11] work you have end of your
[51:15] party and now maybe they going to choose
[51:18] you with another woman
[51:21] man to open the
[51:24] dance why would you be there
[51:28] but you know our company policy
[51:31] no stand for what is
[51:34] right don't say you know I was caught up
[51:37] in a
[51:38] sttion you avoid that appearance of
[51:43] evil praise the name of our you avoid
[51:46] places where you know nothing is
[51:49] discussed but
[51:52] evil you know like
[51:55] clubs you know there's nothing good they
[51:57] discuss there why would you go to a
[52:00] club why would you sit in a
[52:03] bar you know all around people are
[52:05] drinking
[52:06] beers for you also there then they said
[52:10] this not a
[52:11] joke then you also receive it then also
[52:15] you throw back
[52:16] another you are actually defiling
[52:20] yourself so you avoid that you abstain
[52:25] from that
[52:27] praise the name of our Lord you know
[52:29] this place they do this kind of things
[52:31] you avoid it you live things that are
[52:35] not
[52:36] right to keep yourself
[52:39] pure praise the name of our Lord and
[52:41] then the Bible says in Proverbs
[52:47] 28:4 happy is the man that fear
[52:54] all in other words you have the fear of
[52:58] God you don't want to be identified with
[53:01] evil you don't want to go into
[53:03] associations of evil
[53:06] doers you don't want to be identified
[53:09] with people are doing
[53:12] wrong it's the fear of God that keeps
[53:15] you from going into such kind of
[53:19] areas then the Bible says but he that
[53:22] hardens his
[53:25] heart shall fall into
[53:29] Mischief so when you harden your heart
[53:33] what is to harden your heart you don't
[53:36] care ah me I'm strong enough I will not
[53:40] fall by
[53:44] that you know you are hardening your
[53:47] heart but you need to see that you flee
[53:53] evil you abstain from evil
[53:57] but you say me I'm strong I can't fall
[54:00] you are hardening your
[54:02] heart praise the name of you are just on
[54:06] where you are maybe
[54:08] renting your
[54:11] neighbors every morning they busy
[54:13] discussing about
[54:16] people you abstain from
[54:19] that you don't go and associate with
[54:23] them no but for me I know how to keep
[54:27] quiet but what are you
[54:30] receiving from them because there are
[54:33] demons coming from them
[54:36] you and not
[54:38] long you'll be doing the
[54:41] same and always the devil wants where to
[54:46] S he always seeks where to
[54:49] S now for you have hardened your heart
[54:52] so the devil can so there so we need to
[54:55] see that we avoid all the
[54:58] things that are contrary to the word of
[55:02] God praise the name of our Lord let us
[55:05] go to Proverbs 28 again verse
[55:10] 9
[55:14] Proverbs praise the name of our Lord so
[55:17] the Bible says he that turth away his
[55:21] ear from hearing the law even his prayer
[55:24] shall be abomination
[55:35] praise the name of Lord he says you
[55:37] refuse
[55:39] instruction you refuse
[55:44] counsel you know you refuse to be
[55:49] guided ah me I don't care what they say
[55:52] then the Bible says even your prayer is
[55:57] Abomination because youve hardened your
[55:59] heart praise the name of our Lord in
[56:02] other words you're not ready to be led
[56:04] by the
[56:05] spirit the spirit is telling you live
[56:08] this kind
[56:09] of the spirit is telling you don't go to
[56:12] that
[56:14] place you say me I don't
[56:16] care me I can overcome that then the
[56:20] Bible says even your prayer is an
[56:25] abomination because you have rejected to
[56:27] hear the
[56:28] word so then God says I will also not
[56:31] hear
[56:32] you that's what the scripture say so in
[56:36] zear
[56:38] 7 and then verse
[56:41] 11 the Bible says but they refused to
[56:44] Heen and pulled away the shoulder and
[56:48] stopped their ears that they should do
[56:51] not
[56:52] hear zecharia 7: 11 Z for
[57:31] yeah they made their hearts as a damant
[57:34] stone lest they should hear the law and
[57:38] the words which the Lord of host had
[57:40] sent in his Spirit by the former
[57:44] prophets therefore came a great wrath
[57:48] from The Lord of hosts
[58:19] therefore it it is come to pass that as
[58:23] he cried and they would not hear so they
[58:27] cried and I not hear says the Lord of
[58:49] hosts he says if you don't hear
[58:52] me then I also not hear you
[58:56] now so we need to see that we are
[58:58] obedient to the word of
[59:01] God and as the Lord speaks to
[59:04] us then we have hearts of
[59:07] Flesh that can
[59:10] receive if we know there something wrong
[59:13] that we have
[59:14] done then you said Lord help me in this
[59:17] kind of
[59:18] area deliver me from my
[59:21] weaknesses I need your
[59:24] help praise the name of our
[59:26] and then he says if you don't hear the
[59:29] word then the Lord also will not hear
[59:32] your
[59:33] prayers so he says your prayer is an
[59:38] Abomination because you've refused to
[59:40] hear
[59:42] instruction but when you hear
[59:44] instruction and Obey instruction then
[59:48] you confess your
[59:50] sins and then you forsake
[59:53] them and then now you can pray to the
[59:55] Lord
[59:57] and then the Lord can hear
[59:59] you praise the name of our Lord he can
[1:00:01] hear your prayers because there's
[1:00:04] nothing between you and
[1:00:06] him you know you are doing something
[1:00:09] which is right before God so the Lord is
[1:00:12] delighted in your
[1:00:14] prayer praise the name of our Lord like
[1:00:16] in the scriptures in Proverbs
[1:00:19] 15 he says the sacrifice of the wicked
[1:00:24] is an Abomination to the Lord
[1:00:26] but the prayer of the upright is his
[1:00:31] Delight
[1:00:45] verse The Way of the Wicked is an
[1:00:47] Abomination unto the
[1:00:49] Lord but he loveth him that follows
[1:00:53] after righteousness
[1:01:04] correction is Grievous unto him that
[1:01:06] forsaketh the way and he that hateth
[1:01:08] reproof shall
[1:01:22] die praise the name of our Lord so he
[1:01:24] says the sacrifice of the
[1:01:27] wicked is an Abomination to the
[1:01:31] Lord so the prayer is just an
[1:01:34] Abomination whatever that is doing for
[1:01:36] the Lord is an
[1:01:38] Abomination but now when the upright
[1:01:42] praise God is delighted in his
[1:01:46] prayer then says The Way of the Wicked
[1:01:48] is an Abomination unto the
[1:01:51] Lord but he love him that follows after
[1:01:55] righteous
[1:01:58] and that should always be our
[1:02:00] desire to follow
[1:02:03] righteousness to follow the word of God
[1:02:07] not to follow
[1:02:08] groups not to follow this one or follow
[1:02:11] the other one but we need to see that we
[1:02:14] follow the word of
[1:02:15] God and then do that which is right
[1:02:19] before do that which is acceptable
[1:02:21] before the
[1:02:22] Lord that's how the Lord wants us to be
[1:02:26] praise the name of our Lord that you
[1:02:28] know you hate
[1:02:29] sin like job heed
[1:02:33] evil and you know he didn't want do
[1:02:35] anything contrary
[1:02:37] to praise the name of our Lord and when
[1:02:40] job was keeping himself in that
[1:02:43] condition then the Lord would hear his
[1:02:46] pray praise the name of our Lord when
[1:02:49] his friends testified against
[1:02:51] him his
[1:02:54] friends then God told told them go to
[1:02:58] job job him will I he when he
[1:03:02] prays praise the name of our Lord we
[1:03:05] also need to be in that kind of
[1:03:07] condition that God can hear our
[1:03:10] prayers praise the name of the Lord the
[1:03:13] same thing with Abraham God told
[1:03:16] AB go to Abraham he's my Prophet then he
[1:03:21] prays for you then I will heal you PR
[1:03:26] so we need to see that we have the same
[1:03:28] kind of you know condition before
[1:03:32] God that we are acceptable before the
[1:03:35] Lord our life is acceptable before the
[1:03:38] Lord our you know prayer is acceptable
[1:03:41] before the
[1:03:43] Lord you know when I stand before the
[1:03:45] Lord you know I'm speaking the truth
[1:03:48] from my
[1:03:49] heart you know I'm not hiding about you
[1:03:53] know there are some people who are smart
[1:03:56] he tells you this when the heart is on
[1:03:59] something
[1:04:00] else that's not how we need to be before
[1:04:03] the
[1:04:04] Lord David was telling
[1:04:06] Solomon in 1 chonicles
[1:04:10] 28 and then
[1:04:12] verse it says and th Solomon my
[1:04:17] son know the god of thy
[1:04:20] father and serve him with a perfect
[1:04:23] heart
[1:04:26] and with a willing
[1:04:29] mind for the Lord searches all
[1:04:34] hearts and understand all imaginations
[1:04:37] of the
[1:04:40] thoughts if you seek Him He will be
[1:04:44] found of you but if you forsake
[1:04:48] Him He will cast you a far
[1:04:52] off so he says seek the Lord
[1:04:56] serve the Lord with a perfect
[1:05:00] heart with a willing
[1:05:03] mind praise the name of our Lord you
[1:05:05] need to be genuine before the
[1:05:08] Lord you not hiding
[1:05:11] something not pretending over
[1:05:14] something but you know your heart being
[1:05:17] upright before
[1:05:19] the praise the name of our Lord if there
[1:05:21] is Iniquity
[1:05:23] somewhere you acknowledge it before the
[1:05:26] Lord he said Lord have mercy upon me in
[1:05:29] this are Lord deliver me in this kind of
[1:05:33] weakness and then when you do that God
[1:05:36] knowing that you you know that there's
[1:05:38] something wrong before
[1:05:41] you and then Lord have mercy upon you
[1:05:45] then the Lord forgives you and hears
[1:05:48] your prayer praise the name of our Lord
[1:05:51] that's the kind of life we need to live
[1:05:53] every other day
[1:05:56] praise the name of our Lord a life of
[1:06:00] repentance and forgiveness that is a
[1:06:03] continuous life in our Christian
[1:06:06] world that every day in one way or
[1:06:09] another you've done something wrong you
[1:06:13] have thought something wrong you've
[1:06:15] spoken something wrong then when you
[1:06:17] come before the Lord Lord have mercy
[1:06:20] upon me wash me from my weaknesses wash
[1:06:24] me from my failur
[1:06:26] and then you are bringing the the spirit
[1:06:28] of
[1:06:29] God you bringing the spirit of God to be
[1:06:33] friendly with
[1:06:34] you you know to have fellowship with
[1:06:38] you praise the name of our Lord you know
[1:06:40] you need to be
[1:06:42] genuine he says a perfect
[1:06:44] heart and a willing
[1:06:47] mind there's nothing you are
[1:06:50] hiding praise the name of our Lord but
[1:06:53] these days we have smart people
[1:06:56] he says this but he's meaning something
[1:06:59] else and then you start wondering what
[1:07:01] to
[1:07:02] do said but he told me this then he says
[1:07:05] but I didn't tell you
[1:07:07] that then you start
[1:07:10] wondering you know Paul says in 2
[1:07:14] Corinthians chapter
[1:07:17] 4 praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:07:20] verse one says therefore seeing we have
[1:07:24] this ministry as we have received Mercy
[1:07:27] we faint
[1:07:34] not but have renounced the hidden things
[1:07:38] of dishonesty not walking in craftiness
[1:07:41] nor handling the word of God deceitfully
[1:07:44] but by manifestation of the truth
[1:07:47] commending ourselves to every man is
[1:07:50] conscious in the sight of God
[1:08:21] praise the name of our Lord he says we
[1:08:24] have renounced hidden things of
[1:08:31] dishonesty not walking in
[1:08:35] craftiness not handling the word of God
[1:08:40] deceitfully but by the manifestation of
[1:08:43] the
[1:08:44] truth commending
[1:08:48] ourselves to Every Man's
[1:08:52] conscious in the sight of God praise the
[1:08:55] name
[1:08:56] he says we have renounced hidden things
[1:08:58] of
[1:09:02] this you know just like the
[1:09:05] Pharisees when the
[1:09:07] Pharisees when they came to John the
[1:09:12] Baptist they ask John who are
[1:09:17] you no they they say we don't understand
[1:09:21] you and they rejected the baptism of
[1:09:24] John
[1:09:27] when they come to Jesus Christ they ask
[1:09:30] him who gave you that
[1:09:33] power they just rejected the councel of
[1:09:37] God they were walking in this
[1:09:41] honesty they were just crafted
[1:09:45] people you know people who are you know
[1:09:49] like double
[1:09:52] dealers he says this but it means
[1:09:56] another so when they came to Jesus
[1:09:59] Christ and then they were asking Jesus
[1:10:01] Christ who gave you that
[1:10:04] power then Jesus asked them the baptism
[1:10:07] of John is it of men or it's of
[1:10:12] God they excused
[1:10:15] themselves let us go to a
[1:10:17] conference then they went and discuss
[1:10:20] then they
[1:10:22] said and there were many people around
[1:10:26] now if we say that the baptism of
[1:10:29] John is of men these people
[1:10:33] around they us now if Jesus was
[1:10:38] alone they would have told him of
[1:10:41] men but because there were people who
[1:10:43] were their
[1:10:46] congregation they fear the people would
[1:10:47] Stone them because they believed that
[1:10:50] John was a
[1:10:52] prophet then they said ah we don't want
[1:10:55] to be
[1:10:56] Stone what do we do then they said
[1:11:00] because the question was this or
[1:11:03] this now they refused to choose any of
[1:11:06] them but they knew what exactly the
[1:11:09] truth
[1:11:10] is and then they say if we tell him that
[1:11:13] it's of
[1:11:14] God which is true and which people
[1:11:17] believe then will ask us why didn't you
[1:11:20] receive
[1:11:22] John craftiness
[1:11:26] dishonesty so what did they do we tell
[1:11:29] him we don't
[1:11:32] know
[1:11:33] craftiness and there are some people
[1:11:35] their lives they move like
[1:11:39] that today it as if it is
[1:11:42] white the following day you find
[1:11:47] gray double
[1:11:51] standards you know then the other day it
[1:11:53] is black
[1:11:55] and black comes when they're in
[1:12:00] darkness you know just kind of like
[1:12:04] pretense
[1:12:05] craftiness and Paul is saying that we
[1:12:08] have renounced hidden things of
[1:12:13] dishonesty not walking in
[1:12:17] craftiness not Hing the word of God
[1:12:21] deceitfully you know you are not
[1:12:24] deceiving on the word of
[1:12:27] praise the name of our Lord you know
[1:12:29] just like you know the religious
[1:12:32] world love one another love one another
[1:12:36] but behind here they sewing
[1:12:40] hatred that's what they are
[1:12:43] promoting so Paul says we have renounced
[1:12:46] those kind
[1:12:48] of praise the name of our Lord we just
[1:12:51] want to be upright before the Lord
[1:12:55] we just want to do what the Lord wants
[1:12:57] us to
[1:12:58] do praise the name of our Lord in the
[1:13:02] message faith without works is
[1:13:06] dead he
[1:13:09] says now you couldn't have powered
[1:13:11] enough oil on
[1:13:14] her Anointed with
[1:13:18] oil you couldn't have stopped
[1:13:22] or or the devil don't care how loud you
[1:13:28] H he don't pay no attention to
[1:13:32] that that's right but he will recognize
[1:13:37] Faith he will have to know where the
[1:13:40] truth
[1:13:41] lays and recognize the
[1:13:44] truth and recognize
[1:13:47] faith and if you've got
[1:13:50] something that's the reason I watch
[1:13:52] cloth
[1:13:55] now on these lines like we are going to
[1:13:59] have
[1:14:01] tonight we just pray for the
[1:14:04] people and lay hands on them and so
[1:14:08] forth that's the way that's going to be
[1:14:12] up to
[1:14:14] you so you confess your sins before you
[1:14:18] come to the
[1:14:19] platform and say
[1:14:21] Lord anything that's in your life
[1:14:25] you straighten it up from
[1:14:28] now before you come for be it assured to
[1:14:33] you that that thing which will hang
[1:14:36] right over
[1:14:38] you as long as you got un confessed
[1:14:43] sin or maybe something in your
[1:14:46] life that you should you should have
[1:14:50] done that you did not
[1:14:52] do maybe something
[1:14:55] you did that you ought not to have
[1:14:59] done but any of
[1:15:01] those Lord have mercy upon me this kind
[1:15:05] I want to do that which is right I want
[1:15:08] to follow
[1:15:10] instructions I want to be right before
[1:15:13] you I want to live a true life before
[1:15:16] you you know you are not
[1:15:18] hiding you're not hiding your sin and
[1:15:22] then the Bible says if you hide your sin
[1:15:25] you shall not
[1:15:27] Prosper so then you want to declare your
[1:15:29] weaknesses before God and Lord this is
[1:15:33] my area of weakness this is my failure
[1:15:36] this is why I'm ever
[1:15:38] failing praise the name of our Lord and
[1:15:40] then that's how the Lord can come and
[1:15:42] help
[1:15:43] you praise the name of our Lord but then
[1:15:46] if you
[1:15:47] don't then there you not going to
[1:15:51] overcome God reveals it if there is
[1:15:56] anything
[1:15:57] wrong then you make that
[1:16:01] right your healing is
[1:16:04] complete praise the name of our Lord he
[1:16:07] say
[1:16:08] Satan will keep
[1:16:11] there because you have not confessed
[1:16:14] it praise the name of our Lord so then
[1:16:16] you acknowledge your
[1:16:19] weakness like David he acknowledged this
[1:16:23] weakness slow this is my weakness Lord
[1:16:27] this is my area of
[1:16:29] failure in the message how the angel
[1:16:31] came to
[1:16:32] me he
[1:16:34] says in a few
[1:16:37] minutes here they come back up the
[1:16:42] steps tears streaming down their
[1:16:47] cheeks her Satan lost his hold on
[1:16:51] them now there is where it is at
[1:16:56] now that settled it but as long as that
[1:17:00] sin was under
[1:17:04] there no matter how loud you would
[1:17:08] scream how hard you
[1:17:16] would how much all you pour
[1:17:20] on how loud you pray
[1:17:25] easy you
[1:17:26] pray or whatever you
[1:17:29] do that devil will stay right
[1:17:35] there why he has
[1:17:40] a as long as you got UNC confessed
[1:17:44] sin he just stays there that's what
[1:17:47] brother is telling us when you have
[1:17:50] unconfessed sin when you don't
[1:17:53] acknowledge your sin
[1:17:56] he says Satan has got a right to stay
[1:18:01] there because you have his
[1:18:05] own because sin is of the devil and now
[1:18:09] for you have something wrong you
[1:18:11] did and you're refusing to acknowledge
[1:18:14] it so the devil stays there because you
[1:18:18] have his
[1:18:19] good stays
[1:18:21] there so you need to reject the good of
[1:18:24] the devil
[1:18:26] and then the devil will go away you have
[1:18:29] no more
[1:18:30] company you have no more
[1:18:33] Association in that kind of area of your
[1:18:36] weakness and said I acknowledge my
[1:18:39] weakness acknowledge my sin acknowledge
[1:18:43] my
[1:18:43] transgression so you are rejecting
[1:18:46] Satan and whatever he can do you know
[1:18:50] you are rejecting him and then brother
[1:18:53] Bram says if you don't
[1:18:56] confess Satan has got a legal
[1:19:00] right to stay
[1:19:02] there so you reject whatever is of
[1:19:05] Satan you confess it before
[1:19:08] Christ then you are rejecting him you're
[1:19:11] rejecting Satan and then there Satan has
[1:19:15] no right to keep
[1:19:17] there why because you have rejected
[1:19:20] these
[1:19:20] things praise the name of our Lord and
[1:19:23] that's what we need to see that in our
[1:19:26] lives whatever is not of God we reject
[1:19:30] it we throw it away praise the name of
[1:19:34] our Lord we see that we don't entertain
[1:19:37] evil we don't
[1:19:40] Rejoice Lord help me in this
[1:19:43] area and now when you come before the
[1:19:45] presence of
[1:19:46] God like when we see in the
[1:19:49] scriptures in Zaria
[1:19:52] 3 Joshua the high priest
[1:19:57] he came before the presence of God and
[1:20:01] then Satan was resisting
[1:20:05] him Josh 3 rather Zar
[1:20:11] 3:1 the Bible says and he showed me
[1:20:14] Joshua the high priest standing before
[1:20:16] the angel of the Lord and Satan standing
[1:20:19] at his right hand to resist him
[1:20:32] now imagine Joshua the high
[1:20:36] priest and the high priest was the most
[1:20:40] righteous person in the whole
[1:20:43] world was the man who was meant to
[1:20:45] intercede for the sin of the
[1:20:49] world once in would go and take blood in
[1:20:53] the holies of holies
[1:20:56] he intered for himself and for his house
[1:21:00] and for all the children of
[1:21:02] Israel and then here Joshua has gone
[1:21:04] into the presence of
[1:21:07] God to intercede for the
[1:21:10] people but now the Bible says he was
[1:21:14] actually being resisted by
[1:21:18] Satan Satan was offending
[1:21:22] him Satan was kind of in
[1:21:26] him Satan was pulling him
[1:21:30] back and then the Bible says Satan was
[1:21:33] standing at his on his right
[1:21:36] hand and right hand is the right hand of
[1:21:40] authority in other words whatever josua
[1:21:43] was
[1:21:43] doing Satan had taken over it in other
[1:21:47] words to make him do things which are
[1:21:49] not
[1:21:50] right to make him not worship right to
[1:21:54] make him not talk right to make him not
[1:21:58] get time to read the word of
[1:22:00] God and that's how Satan also resists
[1:22:04] us standing on your right
[1:22:06] hand you find you want do this but
[1:22:09] you're doing something different you
[1:22:12] find your meant to go forward in this
[1:22:14] but Satan pulls you back that's what the
[1:22:17] devil was doing to Joshua and many times
[1:22:19] you also get caught up in that kind of
[1:22:23] condition that the w weakness of the
[1:22:25] flesh overwhelms
[1:22:28] you until you find you are you get
[1:22:31] yourself into
[1:22:33] something and then you come to know that
[1:22:35] what I've done is
[1:22:37] wrong that's Satan getting a hold of you
[1:22:42] making you to do something which is not
[1:22:45] right and then the Bible says the Lord
[1:22:48] said unto
[1:22:50] Satan the Lord rebuke you Satan
[1:22:54] even the Lord that has chosen
[1:22:59] Jerusalem is not this a brand pred out
[1:23:02] of
[1:23:07] fire now Joshua was clothed with filthy
[1:23:13] [Music]
[1:23:14] garments and stood before the angel of
[1:23:17] the
[1:23:19] Lord praise the name of Lord he came
[1:23:22] before the presence of God
[1:23:25] so even us in all our
[1:23:27] weaknesses in all our failures when we
[1:23:31] come before the presence of God we allow
[1:23:34] him to wash
[1:23:37] us we allow God to wash us like we have
[1:23:42] come in his presence this
[1:23:44] morning we allow the word of God to wash
[1:23:48] us we allow the word of God voice of him
[1:23:52] that cry
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:23:57] and the house was filled with
[1:24:01] smoke verse five then said I who is me
[1:24:06] for I am undone because I'm a man of
[1:24:08] unclean lips and I dwell in with people
[1:24:12] of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen
[1:24:16] the king the Lord of hosts
[1:24:36] praise the name of the Lord so when
[1:24:37] Isaiah got into the presence of
[1:24:41] God he recognized his
[1:24:45] weakness praise the name of our Lord we
[1:24:47] need to recognize our
[1:24:49] weaknesses where is your weak
[1:24:51] area and when Isaiah recognized his
[1:24:55] weakness he confessed it he acknowledged
[1:24:59] it Lord I'm a man of
[1:25:04] uncleanness how about you what is your
[1:25:08] weakness what is your
[1:25:10] failure acknowledge it before
[1:25:13] God Lord this is my
[1:25:16] wak Lord this is my
[1:25:18] fa no this is where I do a lot of things
[1:25:22] are not right
[1:25:24] whenever I'm tempted in this area I fall
[1:25:29] Lord I need you to give me the
[1:25:32] ability to help you overcome in this
[1:25:34] kind
[1:25:35] of that's what Isaiah was crying he said
[1:25:40] Lord I'm a man of
[1:25:44] uncleanness what is
[1:25:46] me I'm
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:49] undone I'm
[1:25:51] unworthy and then he also re
[1:25:55] realized where I was getting those
[1:25:57] things
[1:25:58] from oh I D in the midst of unclean
[1:26:03] people he realized this
[1:26:06] condition and then he confessed
[1:26:09] it said Lord it's
[1:26:12] me I'm
[1:26:14] undone praise the name of our Lord and
[1:26:17] when he confessed then the Bible says
[1:26:21] one of the Sims
[1:26:23] came with the call of fire and touched
[1:26:27] his
[1:26:27] lips and told him your iniquity is taken
[1:26:32] away and your sin is
[1:26:34] p praise the name of Lord he
[1:26:37] acknowledged his
[1:26:39] weakness he recognized his weakness he
[1:26:42] confessed it before the Lord and then
[1:26:45] the Lord came and delivered him out
[1:26:47] of we also need to be delivered out of
[1:26:49] our
[1:26:51] weaknesses to be delivered out of our
[1:26:53] failure and say Lord this is my weakness
[1:26:57] Lord this is my failure come in this
[1:26:59] area and deliver me come and change me
[1:27:02] this kind of
[1:27:04] condition Isaiah was
[1:27:06] changed he was
[1:27:08] dressed and after they addressed
[1:27:11] Joshua after they had cleaned
[1:27:15] Isaiah there was some work to
[1:27:17] do praise the name of our Lord there was
[1:27:20] some work to
[1:27:21] do and then Isaiah had the voice of the
[1:27:24] Lord
[1:27:26] saying Whom Shall I
[1:27:29] sing praise the name of our Lord he had
[1:27:32] the confidence to say Lord send me now
[1:27:37] praise the name of our Lord and that
[1:27:38] should be the same thing that at the end
[1:27:41] of this service each of us all our sins
[1:27:45] washed
[1:27:46] away all our un rightousness taken away
[1:27:50] and when the Lord says whom I I going to
[1:27:52] S he say Lord I'm
[1:27:55] praise the name of the Lord that when
[1:27:57] you go to your place of work tomorrow
[1:27:59] you are there as a
[1:28:01] witness to tell people about the
[1:28:03] goodness of the Lord at your place where
[1:28:06] you stay you are there as a witness tesy
[1:28:10] of the mercies of
[1:28:11] God the same thing David was in David
[1:28:15] was also in that
[1:28:16] condition the
[1:28:19] guilt you know he says restore unto me
[1:28:22] the joy of your salvation
[1:28:25] praise the name of our Lord says take
[1:28:27] out all the blood
[1:28:31] guilt let us go back to Psalms
[1:28:35] 51 praise the name of our Lord we are
[1:28:39] right before the Lord walking
[1:28:42] upright praise the name of Psalms
[1:28:47] 51 it says restore unto me the joy of
[1:28:50] your
[1:28:53] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[1:29:03] spirit then will I teach transgressors
[1:29:06] thy
[1:29:11] ways and sinners shall be converted to
[1:29:16] you prise the name of our Lord when
[1:29:19] David was
[1:29:20] changed when David the sin was taken
[1:29:23] away
[1:29:24] say now I'm going to those
[1:29:28] transgressors and I'm going to teach
[1:29:30] them your
[1:29:32] way I'm going to tell
[1:29:35] Sinners how they need to
[1:29:37] change praise the name of our Lord so
[1:29:40] you go and become an ambassador of
[1:29:43] God and tell the
[1:29:46] people God doesn't want you to be in
[1:29:48] that
[1:29:49] condition you got your neighbors with
[1:29:54] say ruming is

[1:30:11] people he says

[1:30:21] seven praise the name of our Lord
[1:30:24] the scripture
[1:30:26] says thus says the Lord of hosts if you
[1:30:30] will walk in my ways and if you will

[1:32:04] spiritual but I am caral sold under sin
[1:32:26] for that I do not but what I hate that I

[1:34:37] says who also after you
[1:34:40] believe you were sealed with the Holy
[1:34:43] Spirit of
[1:34:45] Promise Redemption of the purchased
[1:34:50] possession unto the praise of his glory
[1:34:54] so then we need to see that God fills us
[1:34:57] with the Holy
[1:34:59] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is the
[1:35:03] Hest of our
[1:35:05] inheritance in other words our soul has
[1:35:08] been
[1:35:09] redeemed now we are waiting for the
[1:35:11] Redemption of this
[1:35:13] body our soul has got eternal life but
[1:35:17] this body can
[1:35:19] die this body can become
[1:35:21] sick this body
[1:35:25] this body can attract
[1:35:27] sin Satan can attack our bodies but the
[1:35:31] Inside Man is
[1:35:33] converted so that's why we need the new
[1:35:35] birth on the ins
[1:35:38] side so that the man on the
[1:35:41] inside you know the Inner Man the
[1:35:44] converted
[1:35:46] man the converted man on the inside can
[1:35:51] bring the outer man
[1:35:54] under subjection to the word
[1:35:56] of regardless of our
[1:35:59] weaknesses praise the name of our Lord
[1:36:01] the outer man can still be
[1:36:05] subject to the word of God praise the
[1:36:09] name of our Lord that's why we need the
[1:36:10] Holy Spirit on the
[1:36:12] inside and when the Holy Spirit is on
[1:36:14] the
[1:36:15] inside then the Bible says in Romans
[1:36:19] 12 and then verse one praise the name of
[1:36:23] our
[1:36:24] says I beseech you
[1:36:29] Brethren you present your caral
[1:36:33] nature as a Living
[1:36:37] Sacrifice holy
[1:36:40] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:36:43] reasonable
[1:36:44] service but you can only do
[1:36:47] this in case the inside is
[1:36:50] converted but if the inside is not
[1:36:53] converted
[1:36:55] the can nature can never be subject at
[1:36:59] all praise the name of our Lord and so
[1:37:02] the more praise the name of our Lord you
[1:37:05] desire the things of God the more you
[1:37:08] desire the spirit of
[1:37:10] God is the more the Power of this
[1:37:14] flesh is put
[1:37:16] down praise the name of our Lord in
[1:37:19] Galatians chapter
[1:37:22] 5 praise praise the name of the Lord
[1:37:25] Galatians chter
[1:37:27] 5 and then we read in
[1:37:34] verse verse
[1:37:37] 16 it says this I said then walk in the
[1:37:42] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[1:37:44] lust of the
[1:37:52] flesh for the flesh lasts against the
[1:37:55] spirit and the spirit against the Flesh
[1:37:58] and these are contrary the one to the
[1:38:00] other so that you cannot do the things
[1:38:03] that you ought to
[1:38:15] do praise the name of the Lord it says
[1:38:18] the flesh we are
[1:38:19] in will always last against the spirit
[1:38:23] in the Inner
[1:38:26] Man even the spirit in the Inner Man
[1:38:30] will contrary to the
[1:38:33] flesh says each of them is contrary to
[1:38:36] the one
[1:38:38] another praise the name of our Lord so
[1:38:41] then you learn how to yield to the holy
[1:38:44] spirit that you bring the body under
[1:38:49] subjection praise the name of the Lord
[1:38:52] to see how you stay in the Pres of
[1:38:54] God to see how you can be in continuous
[1:38:59] Fellowship that the Lord can give you
[1:39:01] the that such as the heart knows what
[1:39:03] deliver me in this kind
[1:39:05] of deliver me in this kind
[1:39:07] of praise the name of our we need to
[1:39:10] recognize our weaknesses and when you
[1:39:12] recognize it you say Lord have my
[1:39:16] support Lord he said Lord have my
[1:39:19] support Lord deliver me in this kind of
[1:39:22] are deliver me in this kind of
[1:39:25] condition praise the name of our Lord
[1:39:27] and brother Bram says as long as we are
[1:39:30] living in this
[1:39:32] body this body because it's not yet
[1:39:37] converted the conversion of this
[1:39:39] body will be at the time when these
[1:39:43] moral bodies shall become immortal when
[1:39:47] the corruptible body shall become
[1:39:50] Incorruptible so at that time not be
[1:39:53] able to become
[1:39:55] sick it not be not be troubled not be
[1:39:59] worried praise the name of our
[1:40:01] Lord do not be worried praise the name
[1:40:05] of our but right now right now with the
[1:40:08] B of the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:40:13] you because we are still under
[1:40:16] bodies that can easily be
[1:40:20] influenced to do something wrong
[1:40:23] so you avoid things that are not
[1:40:26] try your body is not yet
[1:40:30] converted it can easily be taken in that
[1:40:34] sin it can easily be taken to do
[1:40:36] something
[1:40:38] wrong praise the name of our Lord so you
[1:40:40] don't give room to the
[1:40:42] body to pull you into something wrong
[1:40:46] but then you allow the Holy Spirit to
[1:40:49] govern all your life to take charge over
[1:40:52] your life
[1:40:54] you know you the Holy Spirit leads you
[1:40:56] to the other place gu you to the other
[1:40:58] place and then you allow the spirit to
[1:41:01] take charge over your
[1:41:03] life now it's still back to that most of
[1:41:05] your
[1:41:06] time giving most of your time to that
[1:41:09] character of Christ giving most of your
[1:41:11] time to that character of
[1:41:14] Christ you are yielding yourself to the
[1:41:18] spirit and brother Bram tells us that
[1:41:21] the Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God
[1:41:25] so you take time to read the word you
[1:41:28] take time to hear the
[1:41:30] word take time to obey the word you take
[1:41:34] time to talk about the word of God and
[1:41:38] that's how we can be in
[1:41:41] position to weaken the power of the
[1:41:44] caral
[1:41:46] nature that's we can be able to bring
[1:41:48] our body under
[1:41:51] subjection so that you are under subject
[1:41:54] the leadership of
[1:41:56] God and now when you yield to the spirit
[1:41:59] of
[1:42:00] God praise the name of the Lord when you
[1:42:03] take your time into the things of God
[1:42:08] then the character of
[1:42:10] God will be manifested in your
[1:42:14] life praise the name of our Lord where
[1:42:22] somebody you you are testifying about
[1:42:24] the goodness
[1:42:25] of it's a contrary thing the flesh wants
[1:42:30] you to
[1:42:31] rumor the spirit wants you to
[1:42:34] testify praise the name of our Lord the
[1:42:36] flesh wants you to hate but the spirit
[1:42:41] wants you to love so which side are you
[1:42:44] falling
[1:42:45] on the flesh wants you to be
[1:42:49] bitter the spirit wants you to be good
[1:42:54] praise the name of our Lord so when you
[1:42:56] go by the way of the
[1:42:58] Lord when your Delight is in the word of
[1:43:02] God you take most of your time
[1:43:05] in then the Bible says you shall be like
[1:43:09] a tree
[1:43:11] planted by the rivers of water
[1:43:14] as and it says it brings its fruit in
[1:43:20] season praise the name of the Lord when
[1:43:23] is
[1:43:24] hatred that's the season of
[1:43:27] love praise the name of you don't make
[1:43:31] it you don't just manufacture
[1:43:35] it praise the name of like last the
[1:43:38] other sat on the wedding of Isaac and
[1:43:42] Rose one parent was
[1:43:45] saying you know when he
[1:43:48] calls you keep quiet that is psychology
[1:43:54] praise the but the true fruit of the
[1:43:58] spirit when somebody is
[1:44:00] crowing you'll meet it with
[1:44:04] sweetness praise the name of the Lord
[1:44:06] there's a can nature but there's also a
[1:44:09] spiritual
[1:44:11] nature praise the name of our Lord so
[1:44:13] then you'll find that your
[1:44:16] life is after the things of
[1:44:20] God praise the name of our Lord and this
[1:44:22] is that we can be
[1:44:24] able to overcome our
[1:44:28] weaknesses the things that trouble
[1:44:30] us let us yield to the Holy
[1:44:34] Spirit praise the name of the Lord when
[1:44:36] you recognize where your weakness is say
[1:44:39] Lord have mercy upon me in this area
[1:44:42] deliver me in this kind of area and then
[1:44:45] you allow God to take over your
[1:44:48] weakness praise the name of our Lord we
[1:44:50] need to recognize our weaknesses
[1:44:54] and then bring it before the
[1:44:57] Lord with prayers and
[1:45:01] supplication praise the name of our Lord
[1:45:03] let us go and look at another example as
[1:45:05] I try to
[1:45:08] finish praise the name of our
[1:45:11] Lord let us go to the Book of
[1:45:17] Luke Luke chapter
[1:45:19] 18 and then verse 9
[1:45:26] Luke 18:9 the scripture
[1:45:32] says and he spoke this Parable unto them
[1:45:35] certain which trusted in themselves that
[1:45:38] they were righteous and despised
[1:45:51] others two men went up into the temple
[1:45:54] to pray and one a Pharisee and other
[1:46:03] Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed
[1:46:06] thus himself God I thank thee that I am
[1:46:10] not as the other men extortioners unjust
[1:46:15] adulterers even as this public
[1:46:40] I fast twice in the week I give titles
[1:46:43] of all that I
[1:46:50] possess now that was the Pharisees
[1:46:54] when he went to the presence of God he
[1:46:57] started exting
[1:46:59] himself I do this I do this I have
[1:47:04] strength to do
[1:47:05] this this one I don't do I'm not like
[1:47:08] the other man not like the other one I
[1:47:12] pay my
[1:47:13] ties I fast two times a
[1:47:15] week I'm not like even this other man
[1:47:18] praying
[1:47:20] here how do you approach God
[1:47:24] praise the name of our Lord so when you
[1:47:26] go to God don't tell God your
[1:47:31] strength like
[1:47:33] Nezar all the world is under
[1:47:37] me you tell God your
[1:47:40] weakness Lord this is where I'm failing
[1:47:44] Lord this is where I'm not doing right
[1:47:46] Lord this is where I'm not doing this
[1:47:48] and then the other man the publican
[1:47:53] the Bible says in verse
[1:47:54] 13 and the Publican standing a far
[1:48:01] off would not lift up so much his eyes
[1:48:05] unto
[1:48:08] heaven but SM upon his breast
[1:48:13] saying God be merciful to me a
[1:48:18] sinner praise the name of our that's how
[1:48:21] we approach God Lord have mercy upon
[1:48:25] me Lord deliver me from my
[1:48:28] weakness Lord deliver me from my
[1:48:31] failures that's why the Lord wants us to
[1:48:34] hear recognizing your
[1:48:37] weaknesses Lord this is the area I'm not
[1:48:40] doing
[1:48:40] well this is the area I'm
[1:48:43] failing and then Jesus said I tell you
[1:48:48] this man went down to the house
[1:48:50] Justified
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:56] rather than the
[1:48:58] other for everyone that exalts
[1:49:01] himself shall be Abed and that humbles
[1:49:06] himself shall be
[1:49:08] exalted praise the name of when we
[1:49:12] approach God In
[1:49:14] Prayer acknowledge your
[1:49:16] weaknesses Lord this is my area of need
[1:49:20] you know this is where I'm fa
[1:49:23] be like the
[1:49:25] Publican admit your
[1:49:28] weaknesses tell them before the Lord and
[1:49:31] then ask God for his
[1:49:34] Mercy Lord come down in my are
[1:49:38] of come down in my AGA of
[1:49:41] failure you know the Bible has told us
[1:49:44] if we hide our
[1:49:46] sin we shall not
[1:49:48] Prosper so then you see that you make it
[1:49:51] known before the Lord
[1:49:55] you know like in the Old
[1:49:57] Testament when people had
[1:50:01] leprosy the Bible says in Leviticus
[1:50:05] 13 and then verse
[1:50:07] 44 it says he is a leprous man he is
[1:50:13] unclean the priest shall pronounce him
[1:50:16] utterly unclean his plague is in his
[1:50:18] head
[1:50:45] now he says because the priest checks
[1:50:48] the
[1:50:50] person and then after checking the
[1:50:54] based on the word of God he pronounces
[1:50:57] him
[1:50:59] unclean and when we come before the
[1:51:02] presence of God he examines
[1:51:06] us and then he says this point you are
[1:51:10] lacking this one you're doing is not
[1:51:12] right this thought you're doing is not
[1:51:15] right this word you're saying are not
[1:51:19] right that's what was happening
[1:51:22] and lepos stands for
[1:51:25] sin and then the Bible says in verse
[1:51:28] 45 and the leper whom the plague
[1:51:33] is his clothes shall be
[1:51:50] rent and his head shall bear his head
[1:51:59] bear and shall put on a covering upon
[1:52:02] the upper
[1:52:06] lip and and shall
[1:52:11] cry
[1:52:12] unan un what is he doing he's confessing
[1:52:18] he's confessing his condition he's
[1:52:21] confessing the condition of his
[1:52:24] I
[1:52:25] acknowledge my
[1:52:27] transgression praise the name of our
[1:52:29] Lord I ackowledge my sin I'm not hiding
[1:52:33] it but Lord I'm confessing it I have
[1:52:38] this
[1:52:39] leprosy
[1:52:41] unclean unlean unlean why do you confess
[1:52:46] unclean like Isaiah unlean
[1:52:51] lips when confessed un clean lips then
[1:52:55] he was
[1:52:57] clean praise the name of our Lord also
[1:52:59] when we
[1:53:00] confess before the Lord Lord this is my
[1:53:04] condition Lord this is my
[1:53:07] weakness spirit of God
[1:53:10] comes washes us makes us clean and
[1:53:14] restor us back praise the name of our
[1:53:17] Lord don't hide your weakness before God
[1:53:23] it confess it praise the name of our
[1:53:26] Lord and that's how the Lord will
[1:53:28] forgive you that's how the Lord will
[1:53:30] deliver you praise the name of our Lord
[1:53:34] you know there are some
[1:53:35] people who know how to
[1:53:38] hide praise the name of our Lord and
[1:53:41] they now to hide where you can't
[1:53:44] reach either in the
[1:53:46] bedroom and in the bedroom there is a
[1:53:48] pit
[1:53:52] hidden there then you beat about here
[1:53:56] beat about there you can't
[1:54:00] Prosper but then you said
[1:54:03] Lord you know there are some
[1:54:06] people who have
[1:54:12] tasas and they put it in the west of
[1:54:16] their
[1:54:20] trousers and they saw around it
[1:54:27] it is there some of them put them in
[1:54:29] their inner
[1:54:32] garet just there you can't get it
[1:54:36] however much you search it but he knows
[1:54:37] that is
[1:54:40] there and then some at their
[1:54:43] home you get there is a plant which does
[1:54:46] not
[1:54:49] dry and it's always protected green
[1:54:53] something is
[1:54:55] bur
[1:54:57] hidden there was a
[1:55:00] woman who was a Sunday school teacher in
[1:55:03] the days of brother
[1:55:06] Bram and then she had been taken to in
[1:55:09] institions
[1:55:16] but she would not be delivered at
[1:55:20] all and now she calls sister
[1:55:24] Mida if brother Bram is under the
[1:55:28] anointing you call me so one day brother
[1:55:31] Bram was under
[1:55:32] anointing they called her and then she
[1:55:36] came her problem she had been prayed for
[1:55:39] several times several years she's not
[1:55:43] delivered but now when brother BR was
[1:55:45] under the
[1:55:46] anointing he
[1:55:48] went and got where the problem was
[1:55:53] and then started Discerning her said you
[1:55:56] were in this
[1:55:57] car you were with this person no don't
[1:56:00] say don't say
[1:56:01] don't said but that's where the problem
[1:56:04] is you're with a man committing
[1:56:07] adulter when your husband was in was
[1:56:11] military
[1:56:13] away and then you were in the car the
[1:56:16] train was almost crashing
[1:56:19] you then he told you need to go and
[1:56:21] confess it
[1:56:23] said my marriage will not be
[1:56:27] there she was already
[1:56:31] mad you know she was now
[1:56:34] afraid but something
[1:56:38] hidden and brother Bram says the devil
[1:56:41] has a legal right
[1:56:46] St to stay
[1:56:48] there as long as you have unconfessed
[1:56:50] sin
[1:56:52] so even this woman however much she was
[1:56:55] prayed for she wouldn't be
[1:56:58] delivered because she had the good of
[1:57:01] Satan and brother identified
[1:57:04] it this is the area you need to make
[1:57:10] right and then when brother Bram was
[1:57:12] telling about the
[1:57:14] husband isn't your husband this and this
[1:57:17] doesn't your husband look like this or
[1:57:18] this he said yes he's the one he said a
[1:57:22] problem and then she said my husband is
[1:57:25] a Deon cannot do such a
[1:57:28] thing then he said you can't bring him
[1:57:31] here praise the name of our Lord so
[1:57:35] there are things people
[1:57:37] hide they need to make before
[1:57:40] God said Lord this is my
[1:57:44] weakness like the leper I'm
[1:57:48] unlean
[1:57:50] confession why am I I'm
[1:57:53] unclean Isaiah I'm
[1:57:56] unlean you are calling for
[1:57:59] deliverance you are calling for your
[1:58:02] cleansing praise the name of our Lord
[1:58:04] and Isaiah when he said I'm un
[1:58:08] clean then the the
[1:58:10] sarapin came and made him clean praise
[1:58:14] the name of our Lord and we are now in
[1:58:16] the presence of God to be made
[1:58:20] clean all of us praise the name of our
[1:58:23] Lord that we can be made
[1:58:25] whole whatever weakness that we have

[1:58:36] deliver every one of us praise the name
[1:58:39] of our Lord to change you from that
[1:58:41] condition to restore you back to the joy
[1:58:45] of your salvation to change your nature

[1:58:59] first love of
[1:59:01] God where you used to love God but now
[1:59:05] you don't love him anymore why the
[1:59:08] weaknesses have taken
[1:59:09] over so you say Lord this is my
[1:59:12] weakness Lord this is my failure I don't
[1:59:16] care any about the things of
[1:59:19] God praise the name of the Lord like
[1:59:21] last Saturday when we had the
[1:59:23] wedding praise the name of our Lord most
[1:59:26] of us stayed around up to

[2:00:09] conversation but the whole day you're
[2:00:10] not at
[2:00:12] church because you're going to pray
[2:00:14] because you're going to have the
[2:00:16] Lord praise the name of our Lord then we
[2:00:19] have the wedding the meetings of the
[2:00:21] married people
[2:00:26] and many of them don't want to
[2:00:28] attend then you start wondering where is
[2:00:31] the
[2:00:33] weakness we need to recognize our
[2:00:36] weaknesses and then come and say Lord
[2:00:38] this is my
[2:00:40] area but you see if you don't recognize
[2:00:43] your
[2:00:44] weakness you're not going to be
[2:00:46] help otherwise you are taking a
[2:00:49] Cancer and it keeps on growing
[2:00:53] eating you by the time you come for
[2:00:57] help it may be too
[2:01:00] much maybe the damage is
[2:01:03] Big maybe a number of your children have
[2:01:05] been
[2:01:07] destroyed they're no longer interested
[2:01:09] in the things of God because they see
[2:01:11] the
[2:01:13] parents they don't come for the
[2:01:15] afternoon service they are visiting
[2:01:17] their friends they in their
[2:01:20] businesses what will your children do do
[2:01:23] what example are you giving your
[2:01:25] children Lord this supper you have other
[2:01:28] programs but the things we have them
[2:01:30] once in a
[2:01:31] month but you cannot put time for those
[2:01:34] things of
[2:01:35] God it's a
[2:01:37] weakness praise the name of our Lord so
[2:01:40] you said Lord here I'm
[2:01:42] unclean Lord I need to be helped in this
[2:01:45] kind of
[2:01:46] area are coming to church any time we
[2:01:50] want to come
[2:01:55] time the preacher starts at
[2:01:58] 11 then you also start working out on
[2:02:00] that
[2:02:01] time it's a
[2:02:04] weakness and it's the devil just taking
[2:02:06] a hold of you slowly by
[2:02:10] slow until when the preacher starts
[2:02:13] preaching your mind is still
[2:02:16] troubled just up and down up and down
[2:02:22] by the time you settle the service is
[2:02:24] almost over and then you go back with
[2:02:28] the same weaknesses
[2:02:30] you even more dangerous
[2:02:35] condition yeah because the devil also
[2:02:38] comes to
[2:02:40] church either you've received from
[2:02:42] God or from the
[2:02:45] devil so you go weaker than you
[2:02:48] can instead of stronger than you can
[2:02:53] because you didn't have respect for the
[2:02:55] things so we need to see that we
[2:02:59] recognize our
[2:03:00] weaknesses and then the Bible says when
[2:03:03] we confess we
[2:03:11] forsake praise the name of the Lord if
[2:03:13] my weakness has been going to the
[2:03:16] B I said Lord forgive me for going to
[2:03:18] the B then I stop going to the B
[2:03:22] praise the name of our Lord whatever
[2:03:24] your weakness is praise the name of our
[2:03:27] Lord you confess it and you forsake it
[2:03:31] that's how you are
[2:03:33] delivered praise the name of our Lord
[2:03:35] and one way the Lord
[2:03:37] works when God talks about your
[2:03:40] weakness it means he's there to deliver
[2:03:43] you praise the name of our Lord and I
[2:03:46] believe the Lord is here to deliver
[2:03:48] every one of
[2:03:50] us all our
[2:03:53] it doesn't matter what kind of weakness
[2:03:55] it doesn't matter what kind of
[2:03:58] failure the Lord is here to Deliver Us
[2:04:01] Praise the name of our Lord may God
[2:04:03] bless you
[2:04:09] amen we have an afternoon service for
[2:04:12] the
[2:04:13] Youth praise the name of the Lord I want
