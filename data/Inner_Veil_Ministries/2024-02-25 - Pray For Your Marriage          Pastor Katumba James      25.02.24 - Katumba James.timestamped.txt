[24:06] the
[24:07] message let me get it
[24:26] here
[24:34] the trumpet gives un sound uncertain
[24:39] sound he
[24:40] says any woman that's going to marry a
[24:45] man she's not certain of that
[24:51] man she would better leave him
[24:56] alone and any man that's going to marry
[24:59] a
[25:01] woman and not
[25:03] certain you better leave her
[25:08] alone you would better pray
[25:11] through on
[25:13] it until God gives you the
[25:18] answer and then what God joins
[25:22] together let no man put
[25:26] a but we we must first pray
[25:32] through praise the name of the Lord
[25:34] because it's a serious
[25:38] issue you know you need to
[25:41] pray pray when you are getting into
[25:44] marriage pray for the person you are
[25:46] going to
[25:47] marry even when you
[25:50] marry pray for your
[25:53] marriage praise the name of our Lord
[25:56] pray for your
[25:58] marriage you know the devil is always
[26:03] there praise the name of the lord the
[26:05] devil is always there and what the
[26:09] interest of the devil
[26:11] is is to always see how he puts you
[26:15] off either you are married he wants to
[26:19] put you off if you not married he wants
[26:22] to put you off so what Satan does he
[26:26] always seek things that are contrary to
[26:29] the word of
[26:30] God and he wants you to take that
[26:34] line of living contrary to the word of
[26:39] God if you are not married the devil
[26:42] will seek for you to be in
[26:46] fornication and he will try to make all
[26:48] kind of
[26:50] suggestions and you see this is the
[26:52] order of the
[26:53] day you know everywhere a lot of
[26:57] immorality
[26:59] you go mostly now on thiss of
[27:04] learning boyriend girlfriend
[27:06] boyfriendfriend when the insts are just
[27:10] opening then they call there is a
[27:12] precious
[27:15] ball you know kind of like a party for
[27:19] [Music]
[27:24] freshers those new ones and then now
[27:26] this poor boys and
[27:29] girls they also want to get
[27:32] excited go to the
[27:34] campus and then these continuing
[27:37] students they all excited to pick new
[27:40] ones from
[27:42] them and you know every time and then
[27:45] you go to some of these institions
[27:47] they have culture institutions
[27:52] also like we
[27:55] have and then there is different
[27:58] ones and they also have you know welcome
[28:03] parties and you know they put all this
[28:05] kind of
[28:07] things and if you not careful at these
[28:11] institutions every weekend you in
[28:15] parties if you're not
[28:17] careful this weekend next weekend the
[28:20] other weekend the weekend and some of
[28:23] these businessmen
[28:26] know the business
[28:28] people they know that University
[28:31] students students have
[28:35] money so they bring all Leisure things
[28:38] around those
[28:41] campuses HS
[28:45] [Music]
[28:47] dis all
[28:49] around but they are targeting
[28:52] you that's what the devil is
[28:55] doing so you see see that Satan is out
[28:59] there to see that he destroys
[29:03] you to see that he brings your testimony
[29:07] down to see that you don't have a true
[29:10] Christian
[29:12] Living Praise the name of our Lord and
[29:15] then maybe places of
[29:17] work and then you get a boss is
[29:19] interested in
[29:21] you if you don't do this no
[29:26] job there are no more ethics at places
[29:29] of
[29:34] work just don't
[29:37] care you know gets a young girl from the
[29:40] University
[29:43] institution tries to persuade her in
[29:45] some kind of
[29:46] thing and wants to make her his
[29:53] mistress somebody who can be there to
[29:55] any time he wants her
[29:59] you know so it is so
[30:01] evil it is so
[30:03] wicked and this is the order of the day
[30:06] that we're living
[30:08] in you know just so
[30:12] immoral so now you have to be
[30:16] careful and now in the
[30:19] message enticing
[30:21] Spirits he says now all things ought to
[30:24] be considered prayerfully first
[30:30] seek ye first the kingdom of
[30:34] God and his
[30:36] righteousness and all these
[30:39] things will be
[30:42] added I am positive sure this
[30:46] morning if men and
[30:48] women could only get into the position
[30:52] of where their
[30:55] soul they
[30:57] thinking their
[31:02] attitude will be perfect in the sight of
[31:07] God that would be one of the most
[31:10] powerful
[31:13] churches that ever existed so everything
[31:17] consider it
[31:20] prayerfully where you going to study
[31:22] from consider it
[31:24] prayerfully where you are going to live
[31:28] consider it prayerfully where you are
[31:30] going to
[31:31] rent why would you go and rent in the
[31:34] neighborhood where
[31:37] theyes you know prostitutes running
[31:40] around every
[31:41] time why would you want to to rent in a
[31:44] place where there is a
[31:47] bar why would you want to rent in a
[31:49] place where a lot of wickedness is
[31:53] done why so you need to consider
[31:56] everything
[31:58] prayerfully even your place of work you
[32:01] need to consider it
[32:03] prayerfully if your place of work is

[32:39] this person this person is going to be
[32:41] my friend you don't do that kind of
[32:44] thing you need to consider everything
[32:48] prayerfully because the devil is out
[32:52] there all the time seeking whom he may
[32:56] divine
[32:58] praise the name of our Lord he's seeking
[33:00] whom he
[33:01] made and maybe for you may be on some
[33:04] kind of free range
[33:06] stretch you are just saying ah let me do
[33:09] some relaxation here and then the devil
[33:11] takes a hold of you so we need to
[33:14] consider

[33:19] every decision you make in life find out

[33:39] marriage if you are praying Lord this
[33:42] time I want to
[33:44] marri pray for that seek the Lord that
[33:47] you may get the right
[33:50] person praise the name of our Lord you
[33:53] know you need to seek the
[33:55] Lord to get the the right person and
[33:58] when you get the right person and you
[34:01] are in marriage do the right
[34:04] thing praise the name of the
[34:08] Lord you don't say that all now is done
[34:11] now you've got you say I've got the
[34:12] right
[34:13] person you need to work
[34:16] out in your marriage to be
[34:20] good praise the name of our Lord you
[34:23] need to work out in your marriage to be
[34:27] good now let us Pi this scripture
[34:31] here praise the name of our
[34:35] Lord let me get it
[34:40] here Psalms
[34:43] 34 and then verse
[34:55] 14 the Bible
[34:58] says depart from
[35:05] Evil and do
[35:11] good seek
[35:15] peace and pursue
[35:19] it this is the principle
[35:21] now you want something
[35:24] good depart from evil
[35:28] and when you depart from Evil do
[35:34] good you want peace at home the Bible
[35:38] says seek
[35:40] it and when you find it pursue
[35:45] it you want a good
[35:49] home praise the name
[35:52] of seek
[35:54] it when you find it pursue it maintain
[36:00] it do
[36:03] good praise the name of you know like if
[36:06] you want to be well in your
[36:09] body you don't start biting your
[36:12] finger when you bite your
[36:15] finger what happens you feel the pain
[36:19] and now here the Bible tells
[36:21] us in Proverbs
[36:25] 11
[36:27] Proverbs
[36:30] 11 and then verse
[36:37] 29 he that travels his own house shall
[36:42] inherit Wind And The Fool shall be
[36:45] servant to the wise of
[36:53] [Music]
[36:55] heart
[37:01] now the Bible says he that travels his
[37:05] own
[37:07] house you travel your own house you are
[37:11] the source of conflict at your
[37:13] house you are the source of accusations
[37:16] at your
[37:17] house you are the source of everything
[37:20] that's not
[37:22] pleasant so you are traveling your house
[37:25] and when you travel your
[37:27] house the Bible says you are going to
[37:31] inherit
[37:33] winds in other words you are breaking
[37:37] your
[37:37] home you are going to lose your
[37:40] home you are going to lose your
[37:44] marriage why because you are traveling
[37:48] it so then you need to make sure that
[37:52] you don't do things that are not
[37:55] right you don't do things that are not
[37:59] appropriate praise the name of our Lord
[38:01] now when we continue in Proverbs
[38:06] 24:3 he
[38:09] says through wisdom is a house builded
[38:13] and by understanding it is
[38:24] established he says through wisdom
[38:27] a house is
[38:29] built and by
[38:31] understanding it is
[38:35] established so it is a
[38:37] process you take time to build your
[38:41] house take time to establish your
[38:45] house maintaining it cherishing it
[38:51] working upon it now start asking
[38:54] yourself if things are not the best at
[38:58] home what is my contribution to the
[39:08] mess what have I done to bring that find
[39:11] out
[39:12] yourself ask yourself why are we in this
[39:17] mess you just didn't wake up one morning
[39:19] and everything is
[39:21] bad but there is something
[39:25] gradually that has been shifting from
[39:28] good to
[39:30] bad so then you take
[39:33] responsibility and find out where has
[39:37] this
[39:38] happened what has caused this kind of
[39:41] problem and then you see that in homes
[39:45] it can start from something
[39:47] small and then it brings a
[39:51] complex you know something which is not
[39:53] understood
[39:55] well and then people start living by
[39:58] those kind of
[40:01] Tes the husband is decide and the wife
[40:05] is decid but something
[40:09] small praise the name of our Lord there
[40:12] some homes you go
[40:14] to the husband doesn't talk to the wife
[40:18] the wife doesn't talk to the husband but
[40:20] it's when they get a
[40:22] vist that's when they can sit together
[40:25] and then they come
[40:27] then they start asking what's
[40:29] wrong when the visitor goes end of the
[40:34] conversation
[40:38] wondering very
[40:40] strange during the time of
[40:43] Corona it was
[40:46] tough no
[40:48] visitors everybody was scared of
[40:51] Corona and then you find the children
[40:54] are in the house the husband is at home
[40:58] the wife is at home then you see the
[41:02] complex but we shouldn't allow things to
[41:04] reach that kind of
[41:07] extent praise the name of our Lord God
[41:10] has given you a house God has given you
[41:13] a family God has given you a
[41:17] marriage see that you build
[41:20] it see that you establish it and don't
[41:24] be the pillar
[41:27] where the marriage
[41:28] collapses don't be that pillar where the
[41:32] marriage fails don't be that pillar
[41:36] where the marriage becomes
[41:41] detest you know there are some people
[41:44] they experiencing
[41:47] marriage
[41:49] bitterness when you talk about
[41:53] husband tell me when you talk about a
[41:55] wife don't tell me don't tell
[41:58] me there's something wrong with you and
[42:01] in your home you need to build your
[42:04] house you need to build your marriage
[42:08] praise the name of our Lord now when
[42:10] when people are getting into
[42:13] marriage it is always an
[42:16] excitement like when we look at the
[42:18] marriage in Revelations 19
[42:23] verse let us go there
[42:28] Revelations
[42:35] 197 the scripture
[42:39] says let us be glad and rejoice and give
[42:43] honor to him for the marriage of the
[42:46] Lamb is come and his wife has made
[42:49] herself
[42:55] ready
[43:01] so the Bible is telling us be
[43:05] glad
[43:07] Rejoice give honor to
[43:10] him marriage always brings happiness in
[43:15] homes from the the where the wife is
[43:18] coming where the husband is coming it
[43:21] always brings
[43:23] joy and the institution of marriage
[43:27] God made
[43:29] it that it can bring
[43:32] joy can bring peace can bring Glad
[43:37] Tidings praise the name of our Lord and
[43:39] you know many times when you have a
[43:42] friend and then the friend maybe gets a
[43:46] spouse or or somebody is going to marry
[43:50] they always want to tell you this is
[43:53] what's happening and you know you can
[43:55] even can find Joy all over their
[43:59] faces
[44:01] excitement if you make a program with
[44:04] them and then the spouse makes a program
[44:07] with them the
[44:10] fian they will even forget your
[44:12] program because the mind is the other
[44:15] side you know there is an excitement
[44:18] into
[44:19] marriage and yet the Bible says let us
[44:21] be
[44:22] glad and rejoice for the marriage of the
[44:26] lers come and marriage brings that kind
[44:29] of you know
[44:32] happiness that kind of
[44:35] contentment you know you see when
[44:37] somebody is not
[44:39] married they always working out to reach
[44:42] that
[44:43] marriage until they said this is the day
[44:46] of my
[44:47] life don't spoil my day you know they
[44:51] take it a special day the day that I
[44:54] married the day that I was wed the day
[44:58] that I got a husband the day that I got
[45:01] a wife it a happy day praise the name of
[45:05] our Lord but then now down the
[45:08] road we are asking why is that
[45:12] Joy why is that
[45:15] happiness down along the
[45:17] road what has happen praise the name of
[45:21] our Lord now in Psalms
[45:24] 19 praise the name of our Lord and then
[45:28] we read in verse
[45:30] five the Bible says which is as the
[45:34] bridegroom coming out of his chamber and
[45:37] rejoicing as a strong man to run the
[45:43] rest Psalms 19
[45:54] verse
[46:14] [Music]
[46:17] now the Bible says when the bridegroom
[46:21] is coming out of his
[46:24] chamber he
[46:27] rejoices because he's going to get the
[46:30] bright what a day praise the name of the
[46:33] Lord like last year we had a lot of
[46:36] weddings and then you know they bring
[46:38] them they inside there they
[46:42] waiting they are waiting and then they
[46:45] say now you come in everybody wants you
[46:48] that they are strong move forward really
[46:53] exciting start looking at the time when
[46:56] is the bride coming who is going to
[46:57] bring the
[46:58] bride you know like sometime maybe the
[47:02] parents of the Bride are saying no those
[47:03] have not cleared
[47:06] everything and then negotiations go
[47:09] please we have prepared everything and
[47:13] now when they say she has come somebody
[47:15] says we are happy now there is Joy
[47:19] praise the name of our Lord and now God
[47:22] expects you to keep that joy in your
[47:26] marriage to keep that happiness in your
[47:30] marriage like a young man remember the
[47:34] day when you proposed to her and then
[47:38] she said I accept you how you felt I'm
[47:42] the only man in the
[47:44] world and she also felt I'm the only
[47:47] woman in the world what about
[47:51] now praise the name of the Lord what
[47:54] about now why do you think there are
[47:56] other
[47:57] men why do you think there are other
[48:00] women when you at that time you felt you
[48:03] are the only
[48:04] one I'm the special person and then they
[48:09] write the new bride in the town or the
[48:12] new couple in the
[48:16] town work out your
[48:18] marriage to be
[48:21] pleasant if you are not interested in
[48:23] your
[48:24] marriage nobody will praise
[48:27] it take care of your
[48:29] marriage cherish your
[48:32] marriage pray for your
[48:34] marriage praise the name of our Lord
[48:37] pray for your
[48:38] marriage now the Bible says he that find
[48:42] a
[48:44] wife find a good
[48:49] thing that's what the Bible says he that
[48:52] findeth a
[48:54] wife in Proverbs
[49:02] 1822 provers
[49:08] 1822 whoever find a wife find a good
[49:11] thing and obtains favor of the
[49:24] Lord so my question is where has the
[49:28] good thing
[49:30] gone praise the name of Lord what has
[49:34] happened that the good has become
[49:38] bad why because the Bible says when you
[49:42] find a wife you find a good
[49:46] thing and then you obtain
[49:52] favor now how how do you say
[49:56] to me it's not good to me there is no
[50:00] peace where is the favor of God in your
[50:04] marriage why is
[50:07] it praise the name of our Lord so then
[50:10] you need to find out where where did the
[50:13] problem come
[50:16] from and then you look on your side not
[50:19] again pointing the finger at the other
[50:22] one What contributions have I made
[50:26] to make my marriage
[50:30] hard to make my marriage
[50:33] difficult to make my marriage not work
[50:37] out to make my home
[50:41] unpleasant you know if you are the kind
[50:44] of
[50:45] person where at home you have no
[50:48] peace there's something
[50:50] wrong but you need to have peace at
[50:53] home whereby any time you are happy to
[50:57] be at
[50:59] home and that is the responsibility of
[51:01] both the husband and the
[51:04] wife the wife to make sure that the
[51:07] husband is happy to be at home the wife
[51:11] the the the wife to make sure that the
[51:15] husband is happy to be at home the wife
[51:17] to make sure that my husband is happy to
[51:20] be at
[51:21] home but now if these things at home
[51:25] only take their
[51:27] sleep there's something wrong you find
[51:30] it easy to associate with other
[51:33] people more than your husband or your
[51:37] wife there is something wrong with you
[51:40] you need to see that you made your
[51:43] marriage you need to build your
[51:46] house you need to work out to make it
[51:51] successful and every family every
[51:55] marriage has got
[51:58] challenges don't
[52:01] challenges you don't know what
[52:03] happening how they come yeah find out
[52:06] how did they come
[52:14] there praise the name of our Lord let us
[52:17] look at one marriage here the marriage
[52:20] of Isaac and
[52:23] Rebecca praise the name of our Lord let
[52:25] us go to
[52:27] Genesis chapter
[52:31] 25 Genesis chapter 25 and then verse
[52:38] 19 the Bible says and this are the
[52:41] generations of Isaac Abraham's son
[52:44] Abraham begot
[52:52] Isaac and Isaac was 40 years old when
[52:55] when he took Rebecca to wife the
[52:58] daughter of Beth the Syrian padanam the
[53:01] sister of
[53:03] Laban the
[53:23] Syrian they married
[53:26] at 40 years Isaac got a
[53:29] wife they spent 20
[53:34] years without a
[53:38] child 20 years without a
[53:41] child that's what the Bible says
[53:44] here when you read in verse
[53:49] 26 and after that came his brother out
[53:52] and his head hold on esa's heel and his
[53:55] name was called Jacob and Isaac was
[53:58] three score years old when he bear
[54:24] them 20
[54:28] years no child
[54:31] crying no child
[54:34] crying and you know we have some
[54:38] cultures when the wife is not giving
[54:48] birth and they make sure they put
[54:51] pressure on the
[54:54] man
[54:58] put pressure on the
[54:59] man to get another
[55:02] one but we have Bible examples
[55:05] here look at Zaria and
[55:08] Elizabeth how old they took without a
[55:11] child but Zakaria was
[55:14] faithful that he stood with his wife
[55:18] elizabethe so every home they have
[55:22] varying
[55:24] challenges
[55:25] but when you get a
[55:27] challenge what do you do how do you
[55:30] handle it look at Isaac when Rebecca was
[55:35] not giving birth so many years not
[55:38] giving birth the Bible says that
[55:43] Isaac in chapter 25 verse
[55:49] 21 in
[55:51] Genesis and Isaac ENT the Lord for his
[55:55] wife because she was baren and the Lord
[55:58] was inated of him and Rebecca his wife
[56:13] conceived praise the name of the Lord he
[56:17] entreated now the question
[56:19] is you how much time have you put in
[56:22] seeking the Lord
[56:25] to help in your
[56:27] problem how many times have you brought
[56:30] it before the Lord Lord this is our
[56:33] station the challenge at home may not be
[56:38] barness your challenge at
[56:40] home may not be being
[56:43] baren maybe your challenge at home maybe
[56:47] that you don't have sufficient
[56:49] income you challenge at home maybe you
[56:52] don't have your own house you challenge
[56:55] at home maybe that you live in a place
[56:58] that's not
[57:00] pleasant take it together to the
[57:03] Lord Lord this is our challenge Lord
[57:06] this is our need and then you petition
[57:09] God about that
[57:11] issue and then you don't start blaming
[57:14] the other one for not giving birth you
[57:17] blame your
[57:23] wife blame your
[57:26] husband no put it to the Lord in prayer
[57:31] and learn to be supportive of each
[57:35] other you know there are people who are
[57:44] com the man is
[57:47] already the wife is already Hur and then
[57:50] you keep on hurting her you keep on
[57:53] hurting him
[57:56] maybe she's not giving birth then you
[57:58] hurt her you why did I bring you my
[58:02] house you you're wasting my time that's
[58:05] not right all the man is struggling to
[58:08] get
[58:10] jobs you you man why is the other house
[58:13] doing well you man why haven't you got
[58:17] this that's not the way to do
[58:19] it do everything in love and
[58:23] consideration learn to be supportive of
[58:26] the
[58:27] other praise the name of our Lord but
[58:30] you see there are some groups people got
[58:33] to and then they get advice from their
[58:36] friends you better go this time without
[58:39] greeting her without smiling and you
[58:43] handle that issue how you handle it
[58:47] Isaac didn't do such a kind
[58:49] of you Rebecca did we pay a lot
[58:53] of you were here
[58:56] wasting no Isaac went to prayers in the
[59:01] Lord you need to pray for your
[59:03] marriage praise the name of our Lord he
[59:06] entreated the Lord 20
[59:09] years waiting for the church how long

[59:17] long have you waited why don't you learn
[59:20] to pray over distractions that

[59:27] than able to change the circumstances we
[59:29] are in you are more than able to change
[59:31] the the suffering we are going through
[59:34] more than to change this kind
[59:36] of pray for your marriage praise the
[59:40] name of our Lord and now when I when
[59:42] Rebecca
[59:43] conceived and then the children started
[59:45] struggling in the
[59:47] womb and then she felt
[59:50] discomfort now Rebecca didn't go to
[59:53] which doctors
[59:55] he didn't go
[59:57] there praise the name of our Lord and
[1:00:00] then in verse
[1:00:01] 22 and the children struggled together
[1:00:04] within her and she said if it be so why
[1:00:08] am I thus and she went to inquire of the
[1:00:13] [Music]

[1:11:51] read then the wife would start are
[1:11:53] choosing him what are you going to read
[1:11:57] then the husband starts reading the wife
[1:12:00] say that scripture there is choosing you
[1:12:05] choing you what a
[1:12:09] home we shouldn't have those Stony
[1:12:12] hearts unforgiving hearts hearts that

[1:12:21] another what kind of are you going to
[1:12:24] have how are you going to raise your
[1:12:27] children you know the children are
[1:12:30] watching

[1:13:03] wife in First Peter chapter
[1:13:07] 3 praise the name of our Lord First
[1:13:10] Peter chapter
[1:13:15] 3 and then we go to
[1:13:21] verse verse seven
[1:13:24] the Bible says likewise ye husbands
[1:13:27] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:13:30] giving honor unto the wife as unto the
[1:13:32] weaker vessel and as being hairs
[1:13:36] together of the grace of life that your
[1:13:38] prayers
[1:13:52] beind
[1:13:59] the Bible says there a problem at
[1:14:04] home and you're not dealing well with
[1:14:07] one
[1:14:08] another your prayers can be
[1:14:12] hindered you need to
[1:14:15] reconcile praise the name of our Lord
[1:14:18] you need to be considerate with one
[1:14:21] another by the time you your
[1:14:24] parents and you came together you needed
[1:14:28] one another and that should be the same
[1:14:31] thing now that I love my wife I love my
[1:14:36] husband you need one
[1:14:39] another and you see what the devil
[1:14:42] does when you are
[1:14:49] single you now admire those who are
[1:14:52] married to get there then you get there
[1:14:56] and then the devil what he
[1:14:58] does he comes and makes the
[1:15:01] confusion and then you start ad those
[1:15:04] are
[1:15:08] single that's the devil when you were
[1:15:11] out you wanted to get him when you were
[1:15:14] in you want to get
[1:15:15] up why there's something
[1:15:19] wrong so
[1:15:21] learn to bear with one
[1:15:24] another now that you are
[1:15:27] together don't start looking
[1:15:33] at but now you are together out not
[1:15:37] sleep
[1:15:38] hungry not looking at
[1:15:45] the your of being at home is
[1:15:50] pass praise the name of our Lord now
[1:15:52] it's for you to be together so work out
[1:15:55] to be
[1:15:57] together and then you know there are
[1:16:00] some when they find here in the marriage
[1:16:03] is
[1:16:06] hot they
[1:16:09] Retreat and this happens both to both to
[1:16:12] men and
[1:16:13] women you may find a man doesn't want to
[1:16:16] leave the parent
[1:16:20] home he's failing to meet
[1:16:22] responsibilities
[1:16:24] and then also you find a
[1:16:28] wife but the reason of going there
[1:16:32] things are not working out make them
[1:16:35] work
[1:16:36] out praise the name of the Lord how many
[1:16:39] make
[1:16:42] year every time I'm going back every
[1:16:45] time I'm going back the
[1:16:48] husband also when things are hot starts
[1:16:52] are choosing the wife
[1:16:54] and then he Retreats back home that's
[1:16:56] not what it's meant to be learn to live
[1:17:00] together as
[1:17:01] husband learn to bear with one
[1:17:05] another then the Bible says finally be
[1:17:09] all of One
[1:17:10] mind having compassion one of another
[1:17:14] love as Brethren be pitiful be
[1:17:22] cous
[1:17:33] the Bible says be of one
[1:17:37] mind husband and wife be of one
[1:17:42] mind and you see in the interest of
[1:17:46] Christ he wants to have the same mind
[1:17:49] with the
[1:17:51] brother even as a wife and a
[1:17:54] husband have the same mind try to do
[1:17:58] things
[1:18:00] together trying to share your
[1:18:03] ideas your plans your desires I think we
[1:18:08] could do this I think we could do this
[1:18:11] but then you find this one is going left
[1:18:13] the other one is going
[1:18:15] right how are you going to
[1:18:18] meet how are you going to have a common
[1:18:21] ground
[1:18:23] so we need to have one mind in our
[1:18:27] marriages and when you have one mind the
[1:18:30] Bible says have
[1:18:34] compassion one of
[1:18:37] another have
[1:18:39] compassion when you need
[1:18:41] compassion when you see there's weakness
[1:18:43] in your when you see there's weakness in
[1:18:46] your then you have compassion trying to
[1:18:50] support each
[1:18:51] other against one another prise the name
[1:18:55] of our for example if somebody is your

[1:19:06] weak where you where you are weak let
[1:19:10] your wife be strong where your husband
[1:19:13] is weak let the wife be strong when the
[1:19:17] wife is weak let the husband be
[1:19:21] strong be one
[1:19:24] praise the name of our Lord pleas make
[1:19:26] sure that you're moving together as
[1:19:28] husband and wife and then you're not
[1:19:30] seeking
[1:19:32] differences he said this me I refused it
[1:19:36] now let me also wait for
[1:19:38] him also now it is my turn the other
[1:19:41] time you refused I'm also refusing
[1:19:45] that's not the right attitude you can't
[1:19:47] build a house together when you are
[1:19:50] contrary this one is Raising
[1:19:53] this one is bringing down it can't work
[1:19:57] out let us have one mind let us have
[1:20:00] compassion one for another and then the
[1:20:03] Bible says love as
[1:20:08] Brethren be
[1:20:10] pitiful be
[1:20:12] cous and if he has done you
[1:20:15] evil don't render evil for
[1:20:20] evil when he does raing that's now in

[1:20:38] blessing knowing that you are there

[1:21:04] you are supporting one another you are
[1:21:07] blessing one another if he has done you
[1:21:10] something wrong forgive him don't seek
[1:21:14] to
[1:21:15] Revenge if he shouts at you don't shout
[1:21:20] back praise the name of our Lord
[1:21:23] but then you get in some places it is
[1:21:25] really

[1:22:12] medicine or you'll take the water and
[1:22:16] the
[1:22:17] medicine said please take this is the
[1:22:20] time because the man is
[1:22:23] weak but what the devil does when he's
[1:22:26] weak is when you show him that you are
[1:22:30] weak that's not the thing that's when
[1:22:33] your support is

[1:24:05] quot praise the name of our
[1:24:08] Lord in the message why are people so
[1:24:12] tossed
[1:24:14] about he
[1:24:21] said I stood a few weeks ago where there
[1:24:24] was a big tent
[1:24:29] erected and where a man said he could
[1:24:33] cast out evil
[1:24:36] spirits which I have no doubt by
[1:24:39] that but evil spirits are not cast out
[1:24:43] by cruel indifferent
[1:24:51] living
[1:24:52] you're getting it you may think your
[1:24:55] wife has evil spirit your husband has
[1:24:58] evil spirit so you don't say I'm going
[1:25:00] to become
[1:25:04] tough that's not the way then he says
[1:25:09] the most powerful weapon there is in the
[1:25:11] world is
[1:25:14] love I stood by a little
[1:25:17] lady the other night where the husband
[1:25:21] was fixing to leave
[1:25:24] her and marry another

[1:26:15] excuse and they do something
[1:26:18] different but yet that is not solving
[1:26:21] the problem
[1:26:23] but you are creating a greater

[1:40:00] God praise the name of our Lord now in
[1:40:03] this message look to
[1:40:06] Jesus brother Bram says and I said this
[1:40:10] not because she's sitting
[1:40:12] there because I say it when she is not
[1:40:16] there and you know that I don't believe
[1:40:20] there could be a better wife in the
[1:40:26] world than my
[1:40:30] wife how about you is there a better
[1:40:34] husband in the world than your
[1:40:36] husband or is there a better wife in the
[1:40:39] world than your
[1:40:40] wife no she's the
[1:40:44] best and work it out to be so
[1:40:48] always praise the name of our Lord and
[1:40:51] he says I hope she always remains that
[1:40:54] way and I want to be a royal
[1:40:58] husband and I hope that every young man
[1:41:01] in this
[1:41:04] building when he gets
[1:41:07] married gets a wife like my
[1:41:11] wife I don't know how long we live that
[1:41:15] way but I hope the rest of our days on
[1:41:19] us
[1:41:21] we've been very happy
[1:41:23] together God was the one who told me to
[1:41:26] marry
[1:41:28] her at the same time not
[1:41:34] knowing I was trying not to marry
[1:41:37] her not because I didn't love her but
[1:41:41] because I would think I was not I was I
[1:41:45] I didn't think I was able to make a
[1:41:47] living for
[1:41:49] her
[1:41:51] and she was a fine woman and I just
[1:41:55] didn't deserve
[1:41:57] that and she went out to pray and opened
[1:42:02] the Bible and said Lord I've never did
[1:42:05] this
[1:42:08] before give me a scripture that will
[1:42:11] help me if I I got forget
[1:42:16] him I have forget it open the Bible
[1:42:21] and she went out in the little shed and
[1:42:24] prayed and when she opened the Bible
[1:42:28] Malachi 4 behold I sent you Elijah the
[1:42:32] prophet that was something years
[1:42:39] ago knowing nothing about the ministry
[1:42:42] of this
[1:42:43] day and I couldn't
[1:42:46] be I was lying down on the river there
[1:42:52] and he woke me up one night and I heard
[1:42:57] him standing there by the
[1:42:59] door he's now talking of Christ he
[1:43:03] saying go get
[1:43:05] her and your wedding shall be this
[1:43:09] coming
[1:43:13] October the
[1:43:14] 23 and that's just exactly what I
[1:43:19] did and we've lived Happy by the grace
[1:43:23] of God we've never heard one
[1:43:26] word she's been a
[1:43:28] sweetheart now I'm bringing this
[1:43:31] example to look to see how brother Bram
[1:43:36] married he waited on the Lord until the
[1:43:40] Lord said she's the
[1:43:41] one waited on the
[1:43:46] Lord until the Lord said he is the one
[1:43:49] and then the Lord told them you are
[1:43:51] going to wait on 23rd of
[1:43:53] October this
[1:43:55] year and then the Bible says what God
[1:43:59] has joined
[1:44:00] together let no man put a now you see
[1:44:04] that their
[1:44:05] marriage it is God that purposed
[1:44:09] it their marriage it's God that revealed
[1:44:12] to each of
[1:44:14] them that they should be
[1:44:16] married and they followed every point
[1:44:19] that the Lord guided
[1:44:23] and now they had been living together
[1:44:25] for quite many
[1:44:27] years but now brother Bram because of
[1:44:31] his
[1:44:32] ministry he develops a
[1:44:35] challenge and then he desire to go and
[1:44:38] live in the
[1:44:41] mountains you remember even on his hon
[1:44:44] with
[1:44:45] mid they went to
[1:44:48] hunting what a hon
[1:44:52] was praise the name of the Lord and then
[1:44:55] here he felt after number of years that
[1:44:59] you see God has called me to be a
[1:45:02] prophet so let me go to the
[1:45:05] mountains let me go to the
[1:45:07] Wilderness and I should put my home
[1:45:10] that that's what he was developing in
[1:45:12] his
[1:45:13] mind now in the message standing in the
[1:45:18] Gap so he went so he went to
[1:45:22] sleep and I went speeding down the
[1:45:25] road about 55 miles an
[1:45:30] hour in a
[1:45:32] track going over the
[1:45:35] mountain coming on towards the
[1:45:38] Border down coming to
[1:45:40] Arizona but I was coming now in
[1:45:44] water and I got there coming down from
[1:45:48] the
[1:45:48] mountains and about 20 miles out of the
[1:45:53] city you you've heard it as I told you
[1:45:57] about the morning about the squirrel and
[1:46:01] all these things how something somebody
[1:46:05] went to talking to
[1:46:07] me a voice just as same as you hear mine
[1:46:12] I know it sounds
[1:46:17] neurotic but as I've got through but as
[1:46:20] I have got through
[1:46:23] expressing have I ever told you anything
[1:46:26] but what was
[1:46:28] right and a voice go to talking to
[1:46:32] me I was talking to him it said carry
[1:46:37] out your
[1:46:40] plans and you will be like
[1:46:43] that I said Lord I don't want to be like
[1:46:47] that he said your wife
[1:46:51] will go
[1:46:53] to so she won't live up there in them
[1:46:56] Hills like
[1:46:58] that and you'll become a
[1:47:01] bum just as the dream showed you
[1:47:05] would I said I don't want to be
[1:47:08] that I don't want to have like to live
[1:47:11] like that I want to do something
[1:47:14] different but I was told that you called
[1:47:18] me to be a prophet and I want to live in
[1:47:21] the wilderness like the
[1:47:23] prophet but I was using my own
[1:47:27] excuse so I could
[1:47:31] hunt my own good he said but the prophet
[1:47:36] was the Old
[1:47:39] Testament you've been called to be there
[1:47:42] in a much higher office than
[1:47:46] that he saying you have more gifts
[1:47:49] besides that
[1:47:51] you are called to pray for the SE and to
[1:47:54] preach the gospel and in the apostolic
[1:47:57] form you know of greater
[1:48:00] things many great
[1:48:03] gifts praise the name of our Lord now
[1:48:06] you see the scenario here a complex
[1:48:09] comes to the
[1:48:11] husband and the husband feels ah I
[1:48:14] should go to the
[1:48:16] mountains and then the Lord tells him
[1:48:20] wife is going to leave
[1:48:23] you so then we need to find out
[1:48:26] ourselves what have I
[1:48:28] contributed to the
[1:48:31] condition of my marriage
[1:48:33] now what have I
[1:48:35] done maybe you have made a mistake
[1:48:38] some maybe you took some things slightly
[1:48:42] some and then you don't start choosing
[1:48:44] your
[1:48:45] husband don't start at choosing your
[1:48:48] wife but now you who is
[1:48:51] here you is
[1:48:53] hearing you need to do something about
[1:48:55] your
[1:48:56] mind to make your marriage work
[1:49:00] out and don't say no my husband doesn't
[1:49:03] care my wife doesn't
[1:49:05] care what have you
[1:49:08] done have you taken the challenge in
[1:49:13] love you know with love with prayer and
[1:49:17] said Lord intervene in the St of my mind
[1:49:21] praise the name of our Lord you know
[1:49:23] it's a challenging time that we have
[1:49:26] now when you hear what happens in
[1:49:29] marriage is not really
[1:49:31] Pleasant fighting abusing one another
[1:49:36] denying one another
[1:49:38] this this it's not pleasant at
[1:49:41] all but yet God put the marriage
[1:49:45] institution where you could live
[1:49:48] happily he said if when you get a wife
[1:49:52] you got a good thing but then how does
[1:49:54] your good thing become
[1:49:56] bad how does it be the Bible says when
[1:50:00] you get a wife you find favor of the
[1:50:03] Lord but how does it become this favor
[1:50:06] in your
[1:50:08] home there something wrong which need to
[1:50:11] be handled by
[1:50:13] yourself praise the name of our Lord and
[1:50:15] then the Bible says you know people can
[1:50:18] inherit riches
[1:50:20] they can inherit houses from their
[1:50:23] parents they can inherit whatever
[1:50:25] possessions from their
[1:50:28] parents praise the name of our Lord let
[1:50:31] us go to
[1:50:34] Proverbs praise the name of our
[1:50:37] Lord Proverbs 19
[1:50:41] verse4 Proverbs 19
[1:50:48] verse4 the scripture says
[1:50:53] 19 verse 19
[1:51:06] verse4 houses and riches are the
[1:51:09] inheritance of fathers and a Prudent
[1:51:12] Wife is from the
[1:51:18] Lord
[1:51:23] he says you can
[1:51:25] inherit
[1:51:27] houses
[1:51:29] riches your parents can give you that
[1:51:32] but when it comes to get a Prudent
[1:51:36] Wife comes from the Lord and now as a
[1:51:40] husband you must
[1:51:42] believe you have a Prudent
[1:51:45] Wife but if you don't believe that
[1:51:48] you'll be thinking of exchanging
[1:51:52] you must believe my wife is
[1:51:56] prudent my wife is the best and work out
[1:52:00] on that to bring happiness in your
[1:52:04] home praise the name of our says a
[1:52:07] Prudent Wife is from the
[1:52:11] Lord now the Lord doesn't give
[1:52:15] to
[1:52:17] one till death praise the name of our
[1:52:21] Lord one till
[1:52:24] death so work out your
[1:52:27] marriage to be
[1:52:29] successful don't look for
[1:52:32] excuses you know my wife doesn't do this
[1:52:34] she doesn't how do
[1:52:36] this sh upon
[1:52:42] you give her
[1:52:46] support encourage her strengthen her
[1:52:51] but then you go to your
[1:52:52] relatives and then you are talking about
[1:52:55] your wife every fun who will give
[1:52:58] respect to you who will give respect to
