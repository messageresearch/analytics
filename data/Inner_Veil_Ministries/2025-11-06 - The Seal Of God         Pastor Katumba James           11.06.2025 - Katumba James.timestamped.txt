[22:05] Amen. Are you marked tonight? Praise the
[22:07] name of the Lord.
[22:09] What a good confession.
[22:12] Let us pray. Father, we thank you for
[22:15] this evening.
[22:16] We give praise and honor to your name.
[22:20] Know that we are yours, Lord.
[22:23] We are the ones who have been redeemed
[22:25] of the Lord
[22:28] by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[22:31] And how you assured us, Father,
[22:34] that nobody
[22:36] can block us out of your hands.
[22:39] And now you assured us father
[22:42] that none of us will be lost.
[22:45] How we thank the heavenly father for the
[22:49] seal of the holy spirit
[22:52] that is real in our lives.
[22:55] We give praise and honor to you. We
[22:58] commit ourselves this evening into your
[22:59] hands. Praying that you may come and
[23:02] speak to us, Father,
[23:04] the words of eternal life and encourage
[23:07] us, Lord. Strengthen us, Father. Give us
[23:11] more faith and grace
[23:14] to run the rest that still lays ahead of
[23:16] us.
[23:18] May you fill every one of us dear Lord
[23:21] with your holy spirit Lord and more and
[23:24] more of the Lord
[23:27] more of you coming in us father for we
[23:30] desire you Lord Jesus heal the sick mid
[23:34] heavenly
[23:35] deliver the captives heavenly
[23:38] meet all the needs of your children
[23:41] thy own
[23:44] we love you Lord and we thank you Lord
[23:47] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[23:51] Amen. Amen. Let us go to Ephesians
[23:53] chapter one.
[23:57] We're reading from verse 12 to verse 14.
[24:06] The Bible says
[24:08] that we should be to the praise of his
[24:11] glory, who first trusted in Christ, in
[24:14] whom ye also trusted. After that you had
[24:18] the word of truth, the gospel of your
[24:21] salvation, in whom also after that you
[24:24] believed, you were sealed with the Holy
[24:26] Spirit of promise, which is the earnest
[24:29] of our inheritance until the redemption
[24:32] of the purchased possession unto the
[24:34] praise of his glory.
[25:12] Amen.
[25:16] So I want to preach on the seal of the
[25:18] Holy Spirit.
[25:23] You know the seal itself
[25:28] is the Holy Spirit.
[25:32] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says,
[25:36] you know when you read in the scriptures
[25:38] in from verse 12
[25:43] says we trusted in Christ.
[25:49] You know when you hear the gospel of
[25:51] your salvation
[25:54] the first day that you heard
[25:57] you know God telling you you need to be
[25:59] saved
[26:02] you need to be born again
[26:05] accept the Lord Jesus as your personal
[26:07] savior.
[26:10] So then the scripture says, "I trusted
[26:13] in Christ,
[26:16] praise the name of our Lord, accepted
[26:18] him."
[26:20] You know, just like a young man trying
[26:22] to espouse a young woman,
[26:29] you know, the woman has to put have
[26:32] trust in that man.
[26:37] If she doesn't trust,
[26:39] she will not accept any further
[26:41] relationship
[26:45] because now you can set us have a date
[26:47] somewhere
[26:51] then if the girl
[26:54] if he doesn't trust that person
[26:58] will give all kind of excuses.
[27:02] I'm very busy.
[27:05] you know my parents cannot allow me to
[27:07] get there
[27:09] or I'm not feeling well.
[27:11] You know there are many excuses
[27:15] just like the Bible talks about a man
[27:17] who had prepared a wedding supper
[27:22] and then when he invited people
[27:26] they went to one person
[27:29] the other person said you know I've just
[27:32] bought a cow
[27:35] I need to go and try this bull.
[27:39] How does it perform?
[27:41] So the issue of going to the wedding was
[27:43] not relevant to him.
[27:48] And then another when they went to him,
[27:51] I've just married a wife.
[27:55] You know very well.
[27:58] I need to go and cherish my wife.
[28:02] You know, I need to make my wife happy,
[28:06] spend some time with her, you know, make
[28:08] her, you know, feel good.
[28:11] So, I have no time for you.
[28:15] And then another people kept on giving
[28:17] excuses
[28:20] and so now even
[28:22] when we hear the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[28:26] what is your reaction to the gospel of
[28:28] Jesus Christ?
[28:32] When you heard the message of the hour,
[28:35] what is your response to it?
[28:38] Did you kind of take interest
[28:42] or let me find out what this thing is
[28:44] talking about?
[28:47] What is this message all talking about?
[28:50] Like on the day of Pentecost,
[28:53] these devote Jews had come from
[28:55] different countries
[28:59] and then they were assembled at
[29:00] Jerusalem
[29:03] and then they it was early in the
[29:04] morning
[29:06] and then they heard it was noised abroad
[29:10] people glorifying God in their languages
[29:12] where they coming from.
[29:16] So let us find out what is this thing?
[29:20] what is going on here? And then now they
[29:23] were wondering
[29:25] all these are Galians,
[29:28] are they drunk?
[29:30] And then when they were keeping on
[29:32] asking themselves, wondering what was
[29:34] going on,
[29:38] Peter started preaching to them the
[29:40] gospel,
[29:42] identifying what is happening,
[29:46] what is written in the scriptures.
[29:49] Praise the name of our Lord for getting
[29:51] their attention.
[29:55] And now when he told them, let the house
[29:58] of Israel surely know
[30:02] that this Jesus who was crucified
[30:06] as God made both Lord and Christ.
[30:12] And then he said there's no salvation
[30:14] outside of any.
[30:18] So now they were hearing the word of
[30:21] truth.
[30:23] Praise the name of our Lord, the gospel
[30:26] of our salvation.
[30:29] And so now when they heard the word of
[30:31] truth,
[30:33] the gospel of salvation,
[30:36] the Bible says,
[30:38] they believe that gospel.
[30:42] Even us when we had the word of God, we
[30:46] believe the word of God.
[30:48] We put trust in the word of God.
[30:51] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[30:53] the Bible says when we get to Ephesians
[30:56] chapter 1 verse 13,
[31:00] in whom he also trusted
[31:03] after that you had the word of truth,
[31:08] which is the gospel of your salvation.
[31:12] In whom also after that you believed,
[31:18] You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[31:21] promise.
[31:24] You see how he brings it here.
[31:28] You heard the gospel of your salvation.
[31:32] And then you trusted that gospel.
[31:37] So you believed.
[31:40] If you didn't trust it,
[31:43] you wouldn't believe it. In other words,
[31:46] you accepted it.
[31:48] You said this is mine.
[31:51] This is my portion.
[31:53] You believed.
[31:55] And now in believing,
[31:58] praise the name of the Lord. There is
[32:00] justification.
[32:04] There is sanctification.
[32:07] Now in believing
[32:09] you have to demonstrate that I have
[32:11] believed
[32:14] like in the day of Pentecost
[32:17] they heard the gospel of their
[32:18] salvation.
[32:21] Then they asked the question
[32:24] men and brethren what shall we do?
[32:28] Then Peter told them repent every one of
[32:32] you and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[32:35] Christ.
[32:36] for the remission of your sins
[32:39] and you shall receive the gift of the
[32:41] Holy Spirit.
[32:48] So now that still remains
[32:52] it has never changed.
[32:55] Praise the name of our Lord. It still
[32:57] remains up to now.
[33:00] And that is the formula of the being
[33:03] sealed with the Holy Spirit.
[33:09] hear the gospel.
[33:11] Repent of your sins,
[33:15] believe it.
[33:17] You know, confess it. Be baptized in the
[33:21] name of Jesus Christ.
[33:24] Then God himself
[33:27] will fill with the Holy Ghost. And now
[33:30] you can never fill yourself with the
[33:31] Holy Spirit.
[33:34] It doesn't matter what you think. I I
[33:36] want it so much.
[33:39] It's a sovereign act of God himself.
[33:44] John told them, I can only baptize you
[33:48] in the water.
[33:50] And any minister can baptize you in the
[33:52] water.
[33:54] Come to the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[33:58] He's completely sovereign.
[34:01] God himself does it.
[34:05] So now if you have accepted the Lord
[34:07] Jesus as your personal savior
[34:11] and then you have repented of your sins
[34:14] and you have gone into water baptism in
[34:16] the name of Jesus Christ.
[34:21] Then you say, "Lord, I've done what you
[34:22] wanted me to do.
[34:24] Praise the name of our Lord. I've done
[34:27] as I've been told.
[34:29] So Lord, I'm here. I need your Holy
[34:31] Spirit.
[34:33] The seal of the Holy Ghost to come down
[34:35] in my life.
[34:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Just like a
[34:41] woman who has been who is being talked
[34:42] to about.
[34:45] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[34:47] somebody came and started telling you,
[34:49] "Oh, you look so good."
[34:52] They took your attention.
[34:56] So now every time you're following the
[34:58] man's program,
[35:03] And it is the man himself to w you
[35:08] not you to the man.
[35:11] The responsibility comes back to him
[35:16] to see that he concludes the
[35:18] transaction.
[35:21] Praise the name of the Lord. That's the
[35:23] same thing we need to do with God.
[35:26] Say Lord, you have promised me this.
[35:29] Lord, you promised me this. Lord, here I
[35:32] am. I'm ready to receive what you've
[35:33] promised.
[35:36] Praise the name of our Lord. Like when
[35:38] Ruth
[35:40] went and told, you know, went and told
[35:43] Boaz
[35:45] you are a near kinsman.
[35:49] The Bible says Boaz could not rest
[35:54] until he made sure the issue of Ruth is
[35:57] settled out.
[36:00] And that's the desire of God for all our
[36:02] lives.
[36:04] He shed his blood. And you know it is
[36:08] God who sent the minister to us
[36:13] to preach to us the gospel of salvation.
[36:17] And your responsibility
[36:19] is to accept it is to obey it and then
[36:24] God fulfills his portion.
[36:28] Praise the name of our Lord. God is so
[36:30] faithful.
[36:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Brother
[36:35] says in one message
[36:38] that God desires so much to fill us with
[36:41] the Holy Spirit.
[36:46] That's God's desire. That's why the Holy
[36:49] Ghost was given
[36:52] because God knows that on our own
[36:57] we can't overcome without the Holy
[36:59] Spirit
[37:01] otherwise it will be too heavy for you.
[37:04] It will be hard for you.
[37:07] You will give up along the way
[37:10] because we are kind of by nature in the
[37:12] past.
[37:15] So it's only the spirit of God
[37:18] that comes down in our hearts
[37:22] to make us desire the things of God.
[37:27] Praise the name of our Lord. There is
[37:30] some scripture I want us to pick up
[37:33] in Romans 5:5.
[37:37] The Bible says,
[37:40] "And hope maketh not ashamed because the
[37:43] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[37:48] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
[37:50] us.
[38:02] So he says the Holy Spirit
[38:06] that has been given to us
[38:10] you know brings that love of God.
[38:15] So your desire for God,
[38:19] the Holy Ghost himself,
[38:22] introducing that thirst in your heart
[38:27] for God.
[38:29] Praise the name of our Lord. God creates
[38:31] the thirst in you.
[38:35] God creates that thirst in you
[38:38] and then you desire more of God.
[38:42] You have the love of God.
[38:45] You have the love for the things of God.
[38:49] You have the love to say that no this
[38:50] time is to read the word of God.
[38:55] This time is for me to seek the face of
[38:57] the Lord.
[38:59] The Holy Spirit
[39:02] that creates that kind of thirst in us.
[39:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Jesus says,
[39:10] "You didn't seek me.
[39:12] You didn't choose me.
[39:14] But I chose you. Praise the name of our
[39:17] Lord. So you see, salvation is the way
[39:20] of the Lord.
[39:23] Praise the name of our Lord. From the
[39:25] beginning
[39:27] to the end. So what do you do? You yield
[39:32] yourself to God
[39:34] and say, "Lord, here I am. I surrender
[39:38] myself to you. I'm seeking your face.
[39:42] I'm depending upon you. I believe your
[39:45] promises
[39:47] in the name of the Lord. It's the Holy
[39:50] Ghost that puts the love of God in our
[39:53] hearts.
[39:55] We desire more of God.
[39:59] Praise the name of our Lord. We desire
[40:01] more of God.
[40:04] You know that God is born in your life.
[40:08] God is formed in your life.
[40:12] Praise the name of our Lord. So that
[40:13] when the Holy Ghost comes down,
[40:17] he makes you to start hating the things
[40:19] of the world.
[40:22] You despise the things which to other
[40:24] people they are okay.
[40:30] Praise the name of our Lord. in the in
[40:32] the book of first John chapter 2.
[40:39] First John chapter 2
[40:43] and then verse 15 to verse 17
[40:47] he says
[40:48] love not the world neither the things
[40:51] that are in the world. If any man love
[40:54] the world the love of the father is not
[40:57] in him.
[41:06] Praise the name of the Lord says love
[41:09] not the world
[41:11] you know the order of the world
[41:14] the system of the world
[41:18] like now you know you move everywhere
[41:20] it's a political time
[41:25] this one is poster this one is poster
[41:30] or if maybe others are putting a rally
[41:35] you know but your love is not in those
[41:37] things
[41:40] because it is you are dead to those kind
[41:42] of things.
[41:45] So he says love not the world
[41:49] neither the things that are in the
[41:51] world.
[41:54] If any man love the world,
[41:57] the love of the father is not in him.
[42:02] Praise the name of the Lord. So you see
[42:04] now in Romans 5:5,
[42:10] he says the Holy Spirit
[42:13] has put the love of God in our hearts.
[42:18] When we have the love of God in us,
[42:21] we hate the things of the world.
[42:24] Praise the name of our Lord. You can't
[42:27] take the things of the world
[42:30] in exchange for the things of God,
[42:33] the things of God will matter a lot to
[42:36] you.
[42:39] So in verse 16 he says, "For all that is
[42:42] in the world, the lust of the flesh, the
[42:45] lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,
[42:48] is not of the father, but is of the
[42:50] world.
[43:05] Praise the name of our Lord. The last of
[43:08] the flesh.
[43:11] You know the flesh lusts after this.
[43:15] The flesh lusts after this things which
[43:17] are contrary to the word.
[43:20] If the love of God is there,
[43:24] you not go after the fashions of the
[43:26] world,
[43:29] you know, you're not going to do things
[43:31] the way the people of the world do
[43:32] things.
[43:35] Then he says the lust of the eyes,
[43:40] you know, like you know, everything
[43:42] which is attractive, you desire it.
[43:48] You just put that aside.
[43:51] Then the pride of life
[43:54] you know to show you are so famous,
[43:57] you are a great person,
[43:59] all those kind of games and things like
[44:01] that.
[44:03] Let me know about me everywhere.
[44:07] You are dead to those kind of things.
[44:11] What matters most is Christ being born
[44:13] in you.
[44:17] Praise the name of our Lord. The world
[44:19] passes away and the last day are off.
[44:22] But he that does the will of God abideth
[44:25] forever.
[44:32] Praise the name of our Lord. So now when
[44:35] God puts his love in you,
[44:40] the love of other things becomes dead.
[44:44] In other words, you mortify your flesh.
[44:54] Let us go to Romans chapter 8.
[44:58] Praise the name of our Lord.
[45:01] And then in verse 13,
[45:04] he says, "For if you live after the
[45:07] flesh, you shall die. But if ye through
[45:10] the spirit do modify the deeds of the
[45:14] body, you shall live.
[45:27] So you mortify
[45:30] the deeds of the body,
[45:34] the love of the world,
[45:36] the pride of life,
[45:39] the pride, the the lust of the flesh,
[45:42] the lust of the eye.
[45:45] You mortify them.
[45:48] You die to them.
[45:50] Praise the name of the Lord that you can
[45:52] live to God.
[45:55] And this should be our desire all the
[45:57] time.
[45:59] A life that we live
[46:02] should be a life that is devoted to God,
[46:08] consecrated,
[46:10] given into God.
[46:13] The things of God matter to us more than
[46:16] the rest of the things of the world.
[46:21] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[46:23] Romans 12 and verse one,
[46:28] the scripture says,
[46:31] "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
[46:33] the mercies of God, that you present
[46:36] your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[46:40] acceptable unto God, which is your
[46:42] reasonable service, and be not conformed
[46:45] to the world, but be ye transformed by
[46:48] the renewing of your mind, that you may
[46:51] prove what is that good and acceptable
[46:54] and perfect will of God.
[47:11] So,
[47:24] praise the name of the Lord.
[47:27] Make your body a living sacrifice.
[47:33] In other words, you are allowing the
[47:34] Holy Spirit to take charge over your
[47:36] body.
[47:40] You are not being conformed to this
[47:42] world,
[47:44] but you are being transformed
[47:47] by the renewing of your mind.
[47:52] Praise the name of Lord. Now in the
[47:54] message the 10 virgins
[47:57] and 144,000 Jews he says now
[48:04] I want for the squeezing down part
[48:11] before we leave in the next few minutes.
[48:16] The seal of God
[48:19] is the Holy Spirit.
[48:22] all know that
[48:24] the seal of God
[48:27] is the Holy Spirit.
[48:30] Then he says
[48:33] in first he says you'll find that they
[48:36] all had the seal in their forehead.
[48:47] They had the seal
[48:49] in their forehead.
[48:52] In 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 22
[48:58] verse 22
[49:01] whereby he has sealed us by his holy
[49:04] spirit
[49:06] just read just respond whereby he has
[49:09] sealed us by his holy spirit until the
[49:12] day
[49:16] 4:30
[49:21] Bre not the Holy Spirit.
[49:25] That's that angel that come forth
[49:27] sealing upon their forehead.
[49:32] Now that doesn't mean
[49:36] he takes and puts a spot up here
[49:41] in your forehead.
[49:45] That doesn't mean
[49:48] he takes and puts a spot up here up
[49:50] there.
[49:54] Your forehead is your revelation.
[49:59] See, and your hand is the thing you do
[50:02] about it.
[50:05] See, it is a spiritual mark.
[50:09] He don't take a big stamp and stamp you
[50:12] like that.
[50:15] Now what I wanted here
[50:18] is saying that the mark in the forehead
[50:21] the seal in the forehead
[50:26] you know we can pick that in revelations
[50:28] chapter 7
[50:32] and then we read in verse two and verse
[50:35] four verse three and verse four
[50:38] he says saying heart not the earth
[50:41] neither the sea nor the trees till we
[50:45] have sealed the servants of our God in
[50:47] their foreheads.
[51:04] And I had the number of them which were
[51:06] sealed, and they were sealed 144,000 of
[51:11] all the tribes of the children of
[51:12] Israel.
[51:30] Now he said he put the seal in their
[51:32] foreheads.
[51:40] Praise the name of God. And brother
[51:42] Brennham says the seal of God is the
[51:45] Holy Spirit.
[51:50] And then the forehead
[51:53] [Music]
[51:54] is the revelation.
[51:56] Now when you go to Revelations chapter
[51:58] 13
[52:01] and then he says they put the mark of
[52:03] the beast in their forehead
[52:09] and even in their right hand.
[52:13] Now in Revelation 13,
[52:16] the mark of the beast in the forehead
[52:21] is to accept their false doctrine.
[52:27] The mark of the beast in the right hand
[52:32] is to give them the right hand of
[52:35] fellowship
[52:38] like their doctrine of trinity.
[52:44] the doctrine of trinity.
[52:50] You know you are taking the mark of the
[52:52] beast.
[52:55] Now you may not accept their doctrine
[52:59] but you accept to fellowship with them.
[53:03] Praise the name of the Lord. Taking the
[53:05] mark in the right hand.
[53:10] Praise the name of our Lord. But then
[53:12] here when it comes to the seal of God in
[53:15] the forehead,
[53:19] he says it's the revelation,
[53:22] you know, the revelation of who Christ
[53:24] is.
[53:26] Like brother Brham says
[53:28] new birth is a revelation.
[53:32] God revealing himself to you.
[53:36] Praise the name of our Lord.
[53:38] Now in the message elai
[53:45] he says
[53:55] now
[53:58] okay he says how many knows that God's
[54:01] word says the seal of God is the Holy
[54:03] Ghost.
[54:12] Now then, what is the mark of the beast?
[54:17] Is to reject the Holy Ghost.
[54:22] The mark of apostasy.
[54:29] Remember in the old days when the
[54:32] trumpet, the jubile come,
[54:37] And it trump the trumpet sound it
[54:41] every slave had a right to go free
[54:46] but if he didn't choose to go free
[54:50] taken to the temple
[54:53] and they took an all and b a hole in his
[54:56] ear
[55:00] and he was marked out for the rest of
[55:03] his days.
[55:07] And what is it
[55:10] here? When God calls you
[55:14] to receive the Holy Ghost
[55:17] and you refuse it, then God marks your
[55:20] ear
[55:23] to where you never want to try it
[55:26] anymore.
[55:30] Then that's the mark of apostasy.
[55:36] And in the Bible it said
[55:39] these last days that there would be two
[55:40] classes of people.
[55:45] One with the mark of God,
[55:48] the seal of God
[55:50] and the other the mark of the beast.
[55:55] Praise the name of our Lord. Now you see
[55:58] one has to make a choice.
[56:02] When you accept the gospel
[56:05] go on till you are sealed with the Holy
[56:08] Spirit.
[56:10] Let your life be changed.
[56:14] Don't stop halfway.
[56:17] Don't stop I'm saved.
[56:21] And you don't want to go into water
[56:22] baptism because there are so many people
[56:25] who are like that.
[56:27] how I'm saved. I go to the saved church,
[56:31] the church of saved people.
[56:33] Many people that kind of thing,
[56:37] their lives are not changed.
[56:40] You want to hear the word of God
[56:44] to the word of God. But when you hear
[56:47] the gospel,
[56:49] allow the gospel to fully transform you.
[56:54] And if you are saying you are saved,
[56:57] mean that you are saved.
[57:00] I will no longer go to the nightclubs.
[57:03] I will no longer go to those drinking
[57:04] points.
[57:06] I no longer go to gambling places,
[57:10] standing in sports betting the whole day
[57:15] or the whole which one is winning.
[57:18] You turn your back to those kind of
[57:20] things.
[57:22] I will no longer go to this kind of
[57:24] things which are evil.
[57:27] So now you have heard the gospel and you
[57:30] are accepting the what the gospel is
[57:32] telling you
[57:35] and now when you obey the gospel fully.
[57:39] Praise the name of the Lord. When God
[57:42] seals you,
[57:44] the condition of being filled with the
[57:46] Holy Spirit
[57:51] is obedience to the word of God.
[57:54] You've heard the word. Obey the word to
[57:58] its fullness.
[58:00] Walk all the way.
[58:03] Don't stop halfway.
[58:05] Let us get that in Acts chapter 5.
[58:12] And then we
[58:14] read in verse 32,
[58:18] he says, "And we are his witnesses of
[58:22] these things, and so is also the Holy
[58:25] Ghost whom God has given to them that
[58:27] obey him."
[58:36] Praise the name of our Lord. Obey the
[58:39] word.
[58:42] Praise the name of our Lord. And when
[58:44] you come to Christ,
[58:46] don't come with conditions of your
[58:47] former religion.
[58:52] You know when in this kind of religion
[58:56] this is how we need to do it and you
[58:58] won't continue with the same. You will
[59:01] be that person rejecting the year of
[59:04] Jubilee trumpet.
[59:11] Let us read that in Acts in Exodus
[59:14] chapter 21
[59:18] from verse two.
[59:23] Exodus chapter 21
[59:26] from verse to verse 6
[59:30] said if you buy a Hebrew servant six
[59:33] years he shall serve and in the seventh
[59:36] he shall go out free for nothing
[59:51] because there was a a trumpet sounding.
[59:56] You are free.
[59:58] You are free. But now if himself he
[1:00:02] shall and then he says if he came by
[1:00:04] himself shall go out by himself.
[1:00:11] Now in verse
[1:00:13] six,
[1:00:15] okay, we can pick it from verse seven
[1:00:19] rather from verse five. And if the
[1:00:22] servant shall plainly say,
[1:00:26] I love my master,
[1:00:29] I love my wife
[1:00:31] and my children, I will not go out free.
[1:00:37] Now that's where the challenge is
[1:00:40] because here when you read in the verse
[1:00:41] three and four,
[1:00:44] you get a servant
[1:00:47] and then he comes and to serve you.
[1:00:51] And then you marry for him a wife.
[1:00:54] And then he produces children.
[1:00:57] And the year of Jubilee comes
[1:01:01] and then you tell and the trumpet says
[1:01:03] you are free.
[1:01:06] And now for him he sees.
[1:01:09] How will I live my wife? How will I live
[1:01:12] my children? Because the condition was
[1:01:17] if you married for him, if you gave him
[1:01:19] the wife,
[1:01:21] the the woman remains with you.
[1:01:24] And if you produce children by the woman
[1:01:26] you gave him,
[1:01:29] even the children remain with you. Then
[1:01:32] he says, "No, no, no, no. I'm not
[1:01:34] leaving my wife and my children."
[1:01:38] Then the scripture says in verse six,
[1:01:42] "Then his master shall bring him unto
[1:01:44] the judges,
[1:01:51] He shall also bring him to the door unto
[1:01:54] the doorpost.
[1:02:00] And his master shall bow his ear through
[1:02:03] with an all and he shall serve him
[1:02:06] forever.
[1:02:15] Praise the name of our Lord. You look at
[1:02:17] that.
[1:02:19] So there are some people who have gotten
[1:02:21] the things of this world
[1:02:25] until they can't let those things of the
[1:02:28] world leave them.
[1:02:32] It can be social status.
[1:02:45] How will I leave this place and I go to
[1:02:47] the Christians? No. So he's bound by
[1:02:51] something,
[1:02:54] you know. How can I leave my my kind of
[1:02:57] wealth I have made
[1:03:01] and then go to a poor church or people
[1:03:03] with poor so poor stricken poverty
[1:03:09] like the rich young ruler.
[1:03:12] He knew he needed eternal life
[1:03:15] and he went to eternal life
[1:03:18] and eternal life told him.
[1:03:21] If you're going to do better,
[1:03:24] sell what you have.
[1:03:26] He was not telling him get shares and
[1:03:28] dividends.
[1:03:33] He says, "Sell what you have
[1:03:36] and give to
[1:03:38] not your rich friends that you'll go
[1:03:40] back and ask them.
[1:03:43] Give to the poor."
[1:03:46] So you were not going to demand them.
[1:03:50] The man was married to his wealth.
[1:03:55] So he had his ear b.
[1:04:00] No more desire for the things of God.
[1:04:04] And that's what sometimes the devil gets
[1:04:07] a hold of people.
[1:04:11] Somebody can take a journey
[1:04:15] like they left Egypt
[1:04:17] and then they went into the wilderness.
[1:04:20] But while they were in the wilderness,
[1:04:23] they wanted to go back to Egypt.
[1:04:26] The journey to the promised land was
[1:04:28] hard for them.
[1:04:31] They even made themselves armies to
[1:04:33] fight and go back to the land of Egypt.
[1:04:40] So now even us now
[1:04:43] we shouldn't allow the things of this
[1:04:45] life
[1:04:48] to draw us back
[1:04:51] to prevent us from moving forward.
[1:04:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Don't allow
[1:04:58] those things to make you completely dead
[1:05:00] to the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:05:05] until you despise the word of God.
[1:05:08] You despise fellowship,
[1:05:11] you despise reading the Bible,
[1:05:14] you despise reading the message book.
[1:05:18] All those are spirits of drawing one
[1:05:20] back.
[1:05:24] Praise the name of our Lord. So when we
[1:05:26] hear the gospel,
[1:05:28] we are meant to obey the gospel
[1:05:32] and allow the work of God
[1:05:36] to be completed in our lives.
[1:05:39] Praise the name of our Lord in the
[1:05:41] message the seal of God.
[1:05:44] Brother Brandham says the seal is a
[1:05:47] finished work.
[1:05:51] God has completed his work in that
[1:05:53] person.
[1:06:01] Praise the name of the Lord. He says it
[1:06:03] is a finished
[1:06:08] God himself
[1:06:10] has worked upon that person
[1:06:14] and so he seals him.
[1:06:18] Praise the name of our Lord. He gives
[1:06:20] him the seal.
[1:06:23] his seal.
[1:06:25] So a seal signifies a finished work
[1:06:29] and then a seal signifies ownership
[1:06:35] and a seal signifies security.
[1:06:40] Praise the name of our Lord. So now when
[1:06:43] a seal is given to a person,
[1:06:47] it shows it is a finished transaction.
[1:06:55] Praise the name of our Lord. And then it
[1:06:58] shows that you belong to God.
[1:07:03] And then it shows you are secure.
[1:07:08] Ephesians 4:30
[1:07:12] the Holy Spirit of God.
[1:07:17] Praise the name of our Lord. We are
[1:07:19] sealed until the day of redemption.
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:24] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:07:27] Now in the message the bridge between
[1:07:29] the seven churches and the seven seals
[1:07:37] he says another thing a seal signifies
[1:07:40] is ownership.
[1:07:45] The seal has a mark on it.
[1:07:51] shows ownership.
[1:07:54] When you are bought by the blood of
[1:07:56] Jesus Christ
[1:07:59] and sealed by the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:03] you no longer belong to the world
[1:08:06] or anything pertaining to the world
[1:08:11] owned by God.
[1:08:13] And another thing is
[1:08:16] a seal is security.
[1:08:21] A seal means you are secured.
[1:08:26] Now you don't now you don't believe in
[1:08:30] eternal security.
[1:08:34] But the seal signifies security to its
[1:08:37] destination.
[1:08:44] Wo unto the guy that would try to break
[1:08:46] that seal
[1:08:49] and the Holy Spirit seal
[1:08:53] cannot be broken.
[1:08:57] Praise the name of our Lord. So you see
[1:08:59] when he seals us,
[1:09:02] he shows I've already paid the price.
[1:09:06] I've paid for your sins.
[1:09:09] I've given you my righteousness.
[1:09:12] I've given you my life.
[1:09:15] Praise the name of our Lord. It shows
[1:09:17] that we belong to God.
[1:09:20] We are not of our own. And then shows
[1:09:24] that we are secure forever more.
[1:09:28] Praise the name of our Lord. So if we
[1:09:30] are not sealed,
[1:09:33] we need to desire to be sealed.
[1:09:38] Praise the name of our Lord. In the
[1:09:40] message, the mark of the beast and the
[1:09:42] seal of God.
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:09:47] He says a mark is a distinction.
[1:09:53] It makes a difference.
[1:09:56] separate something.
[1:09:59] You got one mark against you,
[1:10:04] but you never said you had one seal
[1:10:06] against you.
[1:10:16] A mark.
[1:10:19] He said, "If you say you got a mark
[1:10:21] against you,
[1:10:24] that means there's something wrong about
[1:10:26] you,
[1:10:28] but not a seal against you.
[1:10:36] A seal is a sign of ownership.
[1:10:45] A mark is a distinction
[1:10:49] and a church is sealed by the Holy
[1:10:51] Spirit
[1:10:54] showing as ownership.
[1:10:58] God owns the church.
[1:11:02] But the mark of the beast is where the
[1:11:05] outcast
[1:11:09] refuse to take and come God's provided
[1:11:12] way.
[1:11:16] Like a good example is when you buy
[1:11:18] water
[1:11:23] there is always a seal
[1:11:29] like a polyin paper
[1:11:32] and then they say and then they put
[1:11:34] there where you can tear it.
[1:11:39] But if the seal is broken then it's not
[1:11:42] safe.
[1:11:48] So when you are going to drink the water
[1:11:51] you tear the seal
[1:11:53] and then even like now seals are used so
[1:11:56] much in businesses
[1:12:00] like when the goods are coming from
[1:12:02] Mombasa
[1:12:05] a container
[1:12:07] they put a seal
[1:12:12] And it is so simple
[1:12:16] but it has a record on it
[1:12:20] and then it can be having a tracking
[1:12:22] device on it.
[1:12:27] So if you get along the way and you
[1:12:30] break it,
[1:12:34] if you tamper with it,
[1:12:37] your things may be rejected.
[1:12:41] So but that is very delicate.
[1:12:46] So it it has to make sure that this
[1:12:48] thing is secure until it destination
[1:12:56] and maybe like even some other example
[1:12:58] documents we use.
[1:13:02] If it is an office
[1:13:04] then they have something like which can
[1:13:07] inscribe a seal on the paper.
[1:13:16] And then it shows this is the seal of
[1:13:18] this and this is the seal of citizen
[1:13:22] to show that this thing is official and
[1:13:24] authentic.
[1:13:31] So even God,
[1:13:33] he gives us a seal
[1:13:37] and the seal of God
[1:13:40] is the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:42] And the Holy Spirit
[1:13:45] is God himself.
[1:13:47] Praise the name of our Lord. He owns us.
[1:13:52] He owns us.
[1:13:56] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:13:58] when he owns us,
[1:14:01] He manifest himself in our lives.
[1:14:05] Praise the name of our Lord. The life
[1:14:08] which you live
[1:14:11] that shows you are surely of God.
[1:14:15] You surely belong to God.
[1:14:19] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us read
[1:14:21] Galatians chapter 3 and then verse 26.
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:27] He says, "For you are all children of
[1:14:30] God by faith in Jesus Christ."
[1:14:39] For as many of you as have been baptized
[1:14:43] into Christ have put on Christ.
[1:14:50] Galatians 3 27.
[1:15:04] praise the name of our Lord. He says we
[1:15:07] have put on Christ.
[1:15:10] So when we receive Christ as our
[1:15:12] personal savior,
[1:15:15] we need to allow him
[1:15:18] to fill us with his spirit
[1:15:20] to seal us with his life
[1:15:23] so that we are no longer our own
[1:15:28] but we belong to him.
[1:15:31] Praise the name of the Lord. That should
[1:15:33] be your desire every day.
[1:15:35] Fill me with your spirit. And if God has
[1:15:38] filled you with his spirit,
[1:15:41] desire more of his spirit in your life,
[1:15:45] fill me more. Fill me more. Praise the
[1:15:48] name of our Lord. Like that song that
[1:15:50] says, "Fill my cup, oh God.
[1:15:55] Let it run over.
[1:15:57] Run over. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:16:00] Running over in the love of God.
[1:16:03] Running over in the faith of God.
[1:16:06] running over in the patience of God.
[1:16:09] It just keeps on running,
[1:16:13] running. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:16:16] When they ask the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:16:19] when they ask the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:21] that if a person trespasses against me,
[1:16:26] how many times should I forgive him?
[1:16:29] Say seven times
[1:16:31] seven times 70.
[1:16:37] That shows you have the spirit of God.
[1:16:40] You can forgive and continually forgive.
[1:16:46] That's the life of Jesus Christ. Praise
[1:16:48] the name of our Lord. When it comes to
[1:16:50] love,
[1:16:52] you don't only love the people love you,
[1:16:55] but you even love the enemies.
[1:16:58] That's the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:01] So, you allow that spirit to take charge
[1:17:03] over your life.
[1:17:06] and the life itself is manifested.
[1:17:11] So you can't say I'm filled with the
[1:17:12] Holy Ghost
[1:17:15] without the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:18] Praise the name of our Lord. It's the
[1:17:20] life of Christ himself
[1:17:23] that comes down,
[1:17:25] controls your thinking,
[1:17:28] controls your speech,
[1:17:31] controls your conduct.
[1:17:34] It's the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:37] Because the spirit is the spirit of
[1:17:40] life.
[1:17:42] How do you say you have the Holy Spirit
[1:17:45] and you're living contrary to the word
[1:17:46] of God?
[1:17:49] You cannot match. Praise the name of the
[1:17:52] Lord. The seal of God,
[1:17:55] the spirit of God should be real in our
[1:17:58] lives.
[1:18:00] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:18:02] So the seal of God signifies ownership.
[1:18:08] We belong to God.
[1:18:10] The seal of God signifies a finished
[1:18:13] work.
[1:18:15] Our redemption has been done by the
[1:18:17] Lord.
[1:18:20] Much as we are waiting for the day of
[1:18:22] redemption,
[1:18:25] the soul has been redeemed.
[1:18:28] The body is not yet redeemed.
[1:18:30] He has given us the spirit
[1:18:33] to help a pass in this body
[1:18:37] in the weaknesses the body brings to
[1:18:39] you.
[1:18:42] Then the Holy Ghost comes and gives you
[1:18:43] strength,
[1:18:46] comes and helps you to overcome those
[1:18:47] evil thoughts and evil desires
[1:18:52] until the Bible says the Holy Spirit
[1:18:54] helps our infirmities.
[1:18:58] Praise the name of our Lord. And the
[1:19:00] Holy Spirit, the seal signifies
[1:19:04] security.
[1:19:06] So you're not afraid.
[1:19:08] I don't know whether I'm going to hell
[1:19:10] or to heaven.
[1:19:13] You know where you belong.
[1:19:16] You know where you're going
[1:19:18] because you are sealed
[1:19:21] until the day of redemption,
[1:19:23] until the change of these bodies.
[1:19:27] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:19:29] desire to be sealed by God.
[1:19:33] Praise the name of our Lord. So everyone
[1:19:35] knows that you don't have the seal of
[1:19:36] God.
[1:19:39] The seal of God is freely available.
[1:19:44] Praise the name of our Lord. He has
[1:19:46] freely given it to us.
[1:19:49] Just dedicate yourself.
[1:19:51] Commit yourself to the Lord.
[1:19:55] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:19:57] and have faith that Lord surely I need
[1:19:59] you.
[1:20:02] I need your spirit.
[1:20:05] Fill me with your spirit Lord.
[1:20:08] Praise the name of our Lord. May God
[1:20:10] bless you.
[1:20:13] I don't know if we can get that song.
[1:20:16] How easily can we get it? Fill my cup,
[1:20:19] oh Lord.
[1:20:24] Okay, it is not possible. Let us sing
[1:20:26] song 28.
[1:20:30] Okay,
[1:20:32] if you can broadcast it.
[1:20:40] Okay. Can you start it for us?
[1:20:42] Feel my
[1:20:48] I lift it up.
[1:20:52] [Music]
[1:20:54] Come unquench
[1:20:58] the soundings
[1:21:00] of my soul.
[1:21:06] Great heaven.
[1:21:10] Feed me till I want
[1:21:15] no more.
[1:21:18] Fill my cup.
[1:21:20] Fill it up and make me whole.
[1:21:26] Fill my cup.
[1:21:29] Fill my cup, Lord.
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:35] I lift it up, Lord.
[1:21:39] [Music]
[1:21:42] Come and quench
[1:21:45] this casting of my soul.
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:53] Bread of heaven.
[1:21:58] Feed me till I walk
[1:22:03] no more.
[1:22:06] Feel my cup,
[1:22:09] fill it down, and make me.
[1:22:14] Amen. Let us sing Psalm 28.
[1:22:18] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:22:25] Let me walk blessed Lord
[1:22:30] in the way
[1:22:33] has gone. leading strength to the land,
[1:22:43] [Music]

[1:22:58] every day
[1:23:00] with your love. Fill my way.

[1:27:06] Lord. That's our desire. Amen. Let us

[1:27:19] Oh.
[1:27:21] Oh,
[1:27:23] sorry.
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:28] Hallelujah.
[1:27:30] Oh Lord, send a power just now.
[1:27:37] Oh
[1:27:38] Lord, send a power just now and baptize
[1:27:46] everyone.
[1:27:49] Send up power now. Oh

[1:28:07] Oh
[1:28:09] Lord, send the power just now and
[1:28:15] baptize
[1:28:17] everyone.
[1:28:19] They were in the upper chamber now. They
[1:28:22] were in an upper
[1:28:26] chamber.
[1:28:29] They were all with one
[1:28:37] when the Holy
[1:28:40] Ghost descended
[1:28:45] as was promised
[1:28:48] by our Lord. Send the power now. Oh
[1:28:56] Lord,

[1:29:31] with the sound of rushing
[1:29:36] wind.

[1:31:43] Halleluah.
[1:31:45] Oh

[1:31:55] everyone.
[1:31:57] Each of us can speak to the Lord.
