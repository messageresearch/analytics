end is him have you conceited have you conceited for Revelations [Music] this message now and then forever [Applause] the end is here The brighties Awakening Nick Nations We Believe [Music] for the end is [Music] [Applause] [Music] the end is here is routes away [Music] the end is [Applause] [Music] Revelation chapter 10. amen amen have you considered Revelation 10 roses amen amen foreign [Music] another might Angel come down from heaven meaning there was one word then I see another one come from Heaven together closed with the cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun Namaste and his feet as pillars of fire Navigator and the yard in his and a little book and he said his right foot upon the sea garage it was in total control may God bless the reading of the world you may be seated so today for we are still Christ in the bridge but the emphasis is his directly coming to the Jews [Music] and you know many people who don't see this message in the right perspective they don't really see you know that uh uh quote in his perspective but before we get to the court I Want To Live Foundation I do not know how long it will take me but I will try my level best to let down uh something that will help us to understand Revelation 10. and then we shall keep carrying on with it so I want to let the foundation first and I want you to know that and it came to pass in the days when the judges rule that there was a farming in the land it is so in those days grace for the people oh was always upheld by one man and that was the judge that was given in the season and you know when you look at the book of the judges you just keep looking at it exactly the moving of the seven churches there were seven cycles of the judges there was some I mean cycles that had more than one job and then the last cycle is losing his eyesight amen last three weeks we dealt with naked Souls foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but in the days when the judges rule there was a famine in the land because you know the grace was only upheld by one person you see you know uh if I can say is the same thing with most of our Believers most times the people just enjoy the grace of the pastor of the church he said everything about them [Music] and sometimes our young people they just enjoy the grace that the Paris of race demanded and that was exactly the time when the judges amen we do not look to the grace given to our past we need every one of us to dig in the world and to be able to touch the grace of God because we saw here at the other time but the token is personal to the holders you cannot have the token for your local church and some of the young people they just ask under the grace that's the parents have raised them amen amen but the best they can show you that the tradition of the world exemplary because they say we have never smoke never used any drugs amen they are very respectful amen amen praise the Lord but you are cold to make you a calling an election amen amen the good character the person can give you is the correct of the richest they made leaks with the inhabitants of the land and they did not throw away those uh he I mean the altars of the heaven God foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] are continuous there is nothing like a justification stuff sanctifications [Music] so everyone Junction of Grace is present continuous we live in them daily foreign walking God keeps crossing his own borders through those Junctions with his child amen amen you have gone up here but then he says okay you've got the best Mothers but you've got a problem it cropped up yesterday oh it came growing through the time he can take you back again it's a stage of sanctification it's actually not taking you back because that stream is the stream of Grace but with three Junctions being justified free I'll come out a major [Music] but you need this more [Applause] it's a continuing process you know it's a continuing revelation of holiness a life of prayer dedication where are you all those things they keep breaking before you and you obey we are going down that's your sanctification amen Amina John 17 19. let's look at the sanctification of Christ the sanctification of Christ who has dedication for the purpose because that's what sanctification is set aside before service [Music] I Sanctified myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth Jesus says I sanctify myself yes meaning that I keep myself in the volume of the book reading the message [Music] for the purpose are you together with the man what is it I wish you not that statement for the purpose let's go to Acts chapter four verse because they had gone out to preaching the place was shaken where they were assembled together thank you foreign are you together with one is you cannot say justifications it's one stream amen called Grace praise God I'm brother Branham teachers that's the Dynamics in Germany of this church will be a revealing of the Holy Spirit that's the Dynamics that's the moving dynamics of the church is what keeps the church some of the tribes of Israel did not destroy the men of the land and the Man became thought round their entire life for Christ every Christian he came because he had a bothering disease when the hands were laid on him and then got healed he said oh thank you he did not know that even the little things that was at the bottom of the Heart Like a mini spirit amen despising people little fights back and forth a working time to a problem the night of our confession the night of our confession the problem is you considered the greater problem you had at the time not the Great the great every weight and the scene which does so easily besirt Us in the continuing process of sanctification amen Amina so laying aside by believing the world amen amen because when Revelation breaks from the world foreign by staying away from the world Uganda everything that's in the Bible has got a purpose under the car is electricity a certain form of anointing amen Amina you can never say I love a cam 20 when you start from the world you don't study your Bible you don't come to church you cannot claim any form of Victory amen Amina Hebrews God puts a believer in a state of chastisements in the days when the judges wrote but there was a famine in the land I want you to absorb that is when the judges ruled however I was ever forgot Grace was held for the People by one man it is and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to surgeon in the country of Moana um foreign [Music] are you together with me when is it when you are you say man so judges look at the people in the land of Israeli in the days of the judges and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that have lived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord for Israel is [Music] and that was the condition that Israel was in during the time of the judges are you together with me when is it they are not back into the world and yet they were supposed to be the teachers and because they can't put these things together then they start saying the prophet was wrong this is the time which we are living here [Music] foreign [Music] praise the Lord you see you go back in every congregation there is a testimony about the elders they had you know a personal experience with God right enough like we used to hold services for a full week number and the entire church used to come foreign [Applause] but when they die are you always Judges chapter 2 verse 10. and also that generation were gathered unto their fathers another generation after them reaching you not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for his wife and the children of Israel in the sight of the Lord they had an experience so the evil the kids was to serve another God challenge that's what you see now yes they go and serve another God no experience we want a church that will dig into the message and you said this message is and you get proud about it I need young people that will view the personal testimony amen Amina in the land mostly amen amen at that time their Joy was listening to motivational preachers [Music] that will lend them to the foundation and the purpose and you know and when they came into church they could not catch up with the teaching of the holocausts get the messages you bled the tapes but at the same time be feed on the wall build a personal experience verse 14. and the young of the Lord was hurt against his wife the hands of spoilers the hand of the Lord was against them foreign [Music] greatly distressed [Music] are you together with them when is it you need not be distressed if there was Grace held by everybody they wouldn't get into that condition but in the land I am in the land mostly and distressed longer dresses everyone but distressed because they don't put them on one by revelation my dad taught me my mother told me in the land but Mercy distress they were greatly distrusted and verse 16. nevertheless the Lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoon and when the judge died he died with the grace and again those Nations just take your personal token and so Lord this message is some of the younger brothers in the church who don't come from believing family foreign they didn't have a good time because the farming was a necessary tools for chastisement upon Israel and In the Heat of the farming some of Israel they took the weight of least resistors foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] I'm trying to run through because to get to the message so Ruth one two okay he says and the name of the man was one of the rich people he had the ability to move his family yeah because they were running away from the trails they were running away from Justice that God is pointing now in your life it doesn't matter where you go you can never run away from Justice that was a mistake and the name of the man who was in America and the name of his wife and the name of these two are Sons now this story starts out something on that manner imagine of a lovable sweet woman her name was amen Amina and then the husband was saying milk which means worship looking at that family you would see please that's what they were before God but as names characterize us the names of the boys prophesied of the condition they would meet in Milwaukee simply because they were not patient with God they had their son melon by no Mana Maloney which means sickness which means groom sadness amen I mean do I want to find the food but with the worst conditions when there is a condition in your life you are not right by running away from church from Canada foreign [Music] foreign amen Amina and they came to a famine in the land of Israel come on yes brother Branham says [Music] God gave them that land and Abraham was given that life not to live that life when God Saves you is not trying to see if we can save when it brings you into the land of the world later never live that way a Jew is never to leave Palestine as a Believer as a Believer should never think outside of the word box you should always think within the world a Jew is never to leave Palestine and you should never think and try to find Solutions outside of the world what works for the rest it does not work for you you have to stay in the world and prosper is without paying times foreign [Applause] [Music] it was not working for electricity [Music] and then he ran out he was always in trouble if you've got trouble leaving the world is not the best solution foreign you know this is about children whatever it is foreign but Ruth I Ruth and treated him saying amen Amina I will not leave I'll return from following after this yeah [Applause] [Applause] that's what you do when you are giving your life to Christ you break the bridge workloading up you are God amen amen so [Applause] [Music] they too went until they came to visit him and when they came to bethlehemism foreign because she's trying to be restored back um she cannot come back on the same standard science and when she and Ruth entered Bethlehem the city was moved about them is this from a distance it was mixed reactions [Music] that is the light of glitter by which is upon your face when you leave the world everything about you will never be the same the people will meet you about vaccine and they will say is this for the glitter of the presence of the Holy ghosts [Music] when you fall from grace you lose the glory of elective that you are your own health you need total humility rather when you are being restored she lost the beauty of Holiness [Music] the glitter of the rich man's wife was no longer upon our face the people are saying hey gambo did you hear that I'll say it again [Music] and knowing that they had left the church because of just five reasons foreign [Music] is not a pleasant experience not just telling of the present seems to be joyous but grievance nevertheless the Lord uses it to produce out of us Peaceable fruit of righteousness is dealt with by chastisement a bitter experience [Music] the lives [Music] with [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I know the wisdom of God here a magazine the Divine wisdom of God will always reap the best singer even when we feel we are faulted with rose and this is where you never know the story of the bridge is coming in here America [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] foreign among the Hebrews going to be redeemed if there was a wedding Kingsman are you together with me what is it and now the people say you are not Revelation 10. he's coming directly for the Jews listen to me [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] whose damn self is this and I want you to remember I mean Sidious the servants said it is [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah they did say she's Ruthie she's being identified as a more obviously even if you have interests yeah [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] was directly are you together with me there's no way because she was and they keep saying you know Revelation she's coming for the Jews understand the principles amen Amina listen now to this point where the message we are dealing with comes from overcome these seven sealed books is revealed at the time of the seven wonders of Revelation 10. and then he quotes the scripture we've used then he says if you notice that is Christ when he says and I saw another Angel because he in the Old Testament was called the end of the confidence and his directly coming to the Jews now it is for the church is finished are you together so that that's true he's coming directly for the Jews [Music] um so the only way he could get her and get it was to reduce hahaha foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Israel foreign foreign was the god of Israel yeah so Israel carries ready like Naomi was the junction truth Israel Israeli was The Junction to the Nations amen amen so Israel I mean Israel gave to us the gospel yet is that right how did they give it to us by rejecting it praise God so then Acts chapter 13. if the Jews have refused we now turn to the Gentiles foreign now when we talk about the gospel we are not talking about the denomination we are talking about the message of the hour the moment you see that people begin to walk out what are they coming up then Israel is ready amen amen Israel gave us foreign Israel is ready Revelation 10 1. and I saw another might change come down from heaven and the rainbow was upon his hair and his face was as it were the Sun and these feet are Spillers and he's left upon the Earth in the Angel's hand could only be revealed in the time okay Sarah of the seven Finders okay and at that time brother Branham says he's directly coming to the Jews the rejecting people then finally to the Jews okay got it so brother Branham says he's coming directly to the Jews at that statement is Right following that in according to the Gentiles the Jews he is coming to the Gentiles he will be able to catch the Jews foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] under the I succeed because the seventh seed is silence you need to connect these things that's the same day Israel became a nation being gathered back into the land of Israel to wait for their Messiah for their Redemption under the seventh trumpet is the same thing the age of the Lord came to the prophet to commission him foreign so the message of the Covenant comes to fulfill Daniel 10. I know to increase Daniel 12. which is connected to Revelation 10. redeeming Daniel's people and that way are connected together between the sixth and the seventh seals at the time of the opening of The Bible Hallelujah what's the book being open foreign amen are you together with me so we just want to link Daniel 12. and Revelation 10. amen Amina Daniels is connected to Daniel please please I Daniel understood by books the number of years is it Daniel now Israel here this is 70 years before this is but because of disobedience God allowed Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon to take these people into Babylon for chastisements I never left the message I kept myself in the message and I understood by books are you going to study tonight amen Daniel understood by books you to say that they were going to be redeemed out of Babylonia and be taken back to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple okay foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we actually he's talking about two [Music] [Music] [Music] then we shall go beyond that and then come to this season yeah [Applause] [Music] [Music] so from the time Daniel received the Commandments of the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem would be six to nine weeks so the professor spoke of the time from the Commandments which would be 69 weeks I'm wearing down prophetically praise the Lord look how perfect it was a sacrifice in the middle of the week to continue for a full week are you together with me one is it and the full week is how many years but then the scripture says in the midst of the week it is meaning that when Jesus right now he would be able to Ministry for three and a half yes so he was cut off he could not go all the seven years three and a half years of the last week of the prophecy then there is still three and a half years which we are waiting for because I want you to understand this is now among the Gentiles Hallelujah that's why you are here that's why you're a Believer the Jews rejected so this is our season this is our time this is our disposition amen amen God gave it to us so there is this time because you know where we are now great Liberty this is where we find the seven Church ages [Music] this is where Revelation 10 is [Music] that entire Redemption has to be finished but yet at this time I want you to be very emphatic in the queen at the closing of this time begins to awaken the Jews that's their time is over to say time is over Saturday and when time is over it's going on the Jews are trying to make laws in their country that Christianity [Music] will start walking away from the message and what will God do because directs to the Jews and time shall be over praise the Lord don't ever ask me let me try to make it clear here so from Calvary to death the 70th week now listen here I'm trying to finish in the shortest time possible and in the midst of this week amen Amina now if this exactly was seven years each of the weeks and we've already had six to nine weeks then we have got the Gentile age [Music] okay so now let me say this you know that this message is one unit foreign this message is one unit like in the Bible is one unit called the word of God and even this message called the message in over one thousand messages you know the way it does in one of the messages told us that the 70th week that we shall get the quote I think there remains one week seven years and some people say yeah you look at this question he said seven years seven years but he picks it up later in the bridge and he says Messiah was cut off in half the week so we've got another half weeks which is three and a half years amen and it does not give one revelation and then he changes it what he does chocolate so the prophet says God can't give a fast Revelation is changing his mind when he promises had to come through Abraham and then later said it would be by the Bloodlines but it was the same Revelation it only gave the people more information so let us go by the same principle here and bringing the bridge Amen in the last half weeks [Music] the prophet says that's the end when the tribulation period comes now here is a little thing we are going to reverse back a minute where the three and a half years of Daniel's 70 weeks is the last half of Daniel 70 weeks [Music] which is three and a half years how many remembers that from the church ages there is 70 weeks and will be cut off Foreign [Music] for the you know because of the overspread of the Abominations amen down that Calvary and then the chastisement of what they did amen Amina you see because they contained in the overspread of abomination foreign [Music] so he has to go back to the Jews but via the Gentiles and that's how he's connecting us to revelation 10. [Music] because in Daniel welcome Daniel he says that that time your people shall be ready amen amen but then again by the opening of the Bulls we find that we also connected together around the same time amen amen at this time Daniel sees the season of redemption of the names so Daniel chapter 12. and at that time shall Michael stand up that great Prince which stand there for the children of thy people a time of trouble even to the same time people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book Hallelujah now listen at that time [Applause] the great Prince for the children of the people hallelujah and again he sees the same Mighty Angels standing right there so I want us to say that at the closing of time yeah like there was a season of the overallah between amen amen it happened so simultaneously by having near me they gave us the gospel we had it immediately amen amen and that's the end of it that will be also a novel you are rejecting it so it's true characters of Revelation 10 work we create Community is coming directly to the Jews like in the Book of Ruth he was coming directly for us amen Amina so that's the time that John desires since we believe in the principle of the overlap the redeeming of the name begins with the Gentiles at the ending of the time when the remnant will stand up and say and to whom shall we go you've got the words of eternal life as the servant walk away there will be a genuine belief that will hold this message and be taken to the Rapture and at that time I mean the Jew comes amen [Music] it was the opening of the six seals when he got to the seventh seal himself he told us and so this spider over here was about the seventh seal the coming of the Lord is I prefer to go in Luke chapter 21 yes because it is foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there are all kinds of trees when they begin to have an awareness that the Lord will be coming soon behold the fig trees when they now shoot forth wherever you see and know of your own Souls that summer is not at hand then the prophet says [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] brother Godfrey he understands these things very well amen he's not going to restore tradition when he comes he's going to give Israel the same gospel you believe [Music] that's what he's going to give them at this Junction here [Music] Amen in about 15-20 minutes we've got a couple's meeting in the afternoon the Kumi [Music] [Music] the spirit of Grace and of Supplication they shall look upon me it shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one morning for his own son and shall be bitterness for him as one is in bitterness for his first born previously blinded by the law [Music] to her just like it is today we keep looking at this message that one over coming on as a stagnant prophecy and we fail to see the Fulfillment we keep looking at our prophecies as the bride and we keep putting it back to the prophet as an individual classical foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] now listen now listen he says here and the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet same everything is to call the people the bride out of Pentacles and World Traditions Christ impersonated in his word here are you seeing this year he's going to call them out of their tradition do you see that Israel is Awakening they've got a wrong perception they are flying planes to go to Texas and look for red heifers he's not going to restore them to help us then there is a lot of talk about the uh the the Tabernacle of this what does that mean not against that awareness Israel is awake Nations [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] they'll go and look for heifers but as he ruptures us he'll call them out of this Traditions amen Amina praise the Lord yeah just this overlap here there will be a desire among the Jews and all these bills that they are putting out to ban Christianity they are getting aware they are hungry they are fasting they want their Messiah and you play with the message foreign and then he says that John the Baptist was sent foreign [Music] [Music] directly coming foreign [Music] sink yourself in the message when the people are getting out of the message it is a sign that we are giving it back to the Jews foreign [Music] foreign [Music] do what the game with the wild be glad to see him when alone shall come again [Music] [Applause] when our Lord shall come again that is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] they'll be singing [Music] before [Applause] [Music] when our Lord shall come again [Music] bring rejoice [Music] effects to receiving [Music] [Applause] [Music] brother Moses [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Amina [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
