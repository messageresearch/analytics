are great Lord Jesus you are awesome Lord and we bless your Hol name us through Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus us amen let us go to the Book of Luke chapter 1 we are reading from verse 5 praise the name of the Lord says there was in the days of Herod the King of Judea a certain priest named zacharius of the coast of ABIA and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth and they were both righteous before God walking in all the Commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless and they had no child because that Elizabeth was baren and they both were now well stricken in age and it came to bir that while he exed the pri's office before God in the order of his cause according to the custom of the priest's office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the Temple of the Lord and the whole mud of the people were praying without at the time of incense and there appeared un him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when Zacharia saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon Him n but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharia for thy prayer is had and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shall call his name John and thou shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his may God of his word may be SE I want to preach about the joy of being born the joy of being born now here we see that Zacharia and Elizabeth they didn't have a child and you know if when a family does doesn't have a child many times there is sorrow in that family praise the name of our Lord there is always sorrow and you see the way the scripture says that there are certain things which they say it's not enough praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible gives about the examples of the things that say it's not enough I just want to get that scripture but one of them is a baren wom when a woman doesn't give birth it's she says it's not enough praise the name of our Lord and so now when they are not producing let us go to Proverbs Chapter 30 Proverbs 1 verse 15 he says the H has two daughters crying give give there are three things that are never satisfied yeah four things it is not it's not enough he says the grave so the grave is ready to take all the people and you know there's a scripture which says When sin increases even hell expands in other words ready to bring more now then he again he says and the bar womb it says it's not enough then he says the Earth that is not filled with water whatever water comes is all taken up and the fire that says not it's not enough praise the name of the Lord so now we see that in the family of Zakaria he saw a vision of an Angel and then the angel told him you are going to give birth to a son and then the angel says that many people shall rejoice at his birth now we see that the natural birth bring such Joy praise the name of our Lord brings Joy to the family brings Joy to the community pray the every person is Happy praise the name of our you know there is no morning when somebody is born but there is celebration there is joy everybody shows the kindness they want to come and look at the baby they want to come and hold the baby then they come and congratulate the mother congratulate the father and everybody is Happy praise the name of our living and so now the birth of John brought Jo to the family and even Joy to the Community Praise the name of our Lord so Elizabeth conceived praise the name of our Lord when she conceived you know it was something like she was like such a great joy in her until the Bible says she hid herself months praise the name of our Lord and then she said God is taking away my reproach among men there is a lot of joy in the natural B there's a lot of celebration in our natural B but now if the first birth brings such Joy how about the second bus praise the name of our Lord yet the first bus brings something of time something that's going to die something that's literally temporary how much more about the second bir how much joy does it bring if you are born again praise the name of our Lord the Bible says there is a lot of joy in heaven when one sinner is converted praise the name of our Lord the makes the seven celebrate praise the name of our Lord like when our sister here praise the name of our Lord when she accepted the Lord Jesus as her personal savior there was great joy in heaven praise the name of our Lord here on Earth under the Earth Kingdom there is Joy but now in the kingdom of God the Angels celebrate when one sinner is converted into the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord let us go to Luke chapter 15 and then read from verse one so the Bible says then then Drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and the Pharisees and scribes mama saying this man receiveth Sinners and eateth with them spoke this Parable unto them saying what man of you having a 100 sheep if he lose one of them does not leave the 90 and N in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it and when he has found it he lays it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home he calls together his friends and neighbors saying unto them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sin that repentance more than over the 99 just persons which need no repentance praise the name of our Lord so there is Joy at our new bir and this Joy the Bible says is in heaven Angels rejoice when a sinner is Born Again praise the name of our Lord Angels rejoice when you identify your position Angels rejoice when you are born into the kingdom just like when you are born here on Earth and you are born in a family you receive a possession you receive you know kind of like a portion so even us when we are born into the kingdom of God we receive our inheritance praise the name of our Lord we identify that we are part of the Kingdom praise the name of our Lord and that's why we need to desire to be born again don't be satisfied by only your first birth but make sure that you are born again make sure that you are born into the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord make sure that you have the new birth make sure that you have your possession in heaven praise the name of our Lord because these natural things are going to pass away they are so temporary it is a shadow of life and the Bible says it is a passing Shadow and when it's a passing Shadow you can't follow it but when you are born into the kingdom of God it brings a lot of joy and should also bring you Joy like that song we s it was a happy day praise the name of our Lord when Jesus redeemed me and you see when you have truly been born again the Bible says you find peace with God and that peace that God only can give you it brings you Joy Joy that I'm a Child of God joy that I'm born again joy that I have eternal life joy that I'm not my own joy that I'm of the Lord and regardless of what you going through maybe hards maybe trials or you don't have this or you lack this there is a satisfaction that comes in you that I belong to the Lord praise the name of our Lord and that should be something that keeps us going every day that I am not of my own but I am of God praise the name of our Lord he should give us joy now the Bible says John 16 ver 21 he says a woman when she is in travel has sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she's delivered of the child she remember no more the anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the [Music] world Amen now you see there is joy for the natural birth such great joy praise the name of our Lord you know it is something that people now start thinking now if they they have had no child said now we have a hair now we have somebody who is part of us and then you see some families when they don't have a child differences can rise up very fast and then In some cultures when the wife doesn't produce then they start choosing the wife some cures then others but that was not so with Zakaria and Elizabeth they aged together even without a child Zakaria fear and respected Elizabeth that much is not giving back she was his wife but then in some areas they look for substitutions immediately that was not Z praise the name of the Lord the Bible says they lived in righteousness they lived in Holiness and even in the fear of God praise the name of our Lord so when you get into marriage be ready for what will happen in it praise the name of our Lord not just looking if this one doesn't happen I will have plan B that was not zakar and Elizabeth they were committed to one another praise the name of our Lord they lived the righteous life they had the fear of God they were advanced in age and then they kept on praying kep on praying praying until God in his time unites us what puts us together for one another and now you should make sure that you know you live the lives that are we just need to be patient Elizabeth didn't go out neither did Zar one another and waited on the Lord praise the name of our Lord that the testimony of God can be with them praise the name of the Lord let us go to Philippians 3: 20 phili Philippians 3:20 the Bible says for our conversation is in heaven from when also we look for the Savior Lord praise the name of our Lord he says our citizenship is in heaven praise the name of our Lord like now when you go to a place they ask where were you born I was born from which is the village which is the sub but then you identify that place you mention that place as your birth place but then the Bible saying our citizenship is in heaven now how can you be a citizen of heaven without being born there so then as we were born here on Earth we also need to be born in heaven and being born in heaven is being born by the Holy Spirit which comes from Heaven here on Earth you were born in the flesh and the Bible says that which is born of flesh is flesh and that's the first birth and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit that's the second ver so we also need to be born in heaven as we were born here on Earth we also need to be born in heaven then we can say our citizenship is in heaven but if you have never been born In Heaven There is no inheritance in Heaven until you are born in heaven that's when you get inheritance in heaven that's when you get possessions in heaven and now God is calling us to be born again Jesus told Nicodemus unless a man is born again that word again meant above let us go to John 3:3 John 3:3 the scripture says Jesus answered and said unto him V I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now that word again again is from above that's what he meant when you go back and follow the original translations it says unless a man is born from above so there is being born here on Earth and there also being born from from above now our first bir comes from the first Adam that which is born of flesh is flesh the First Corinthians chapter 15 the first man then the second man is the Lord From Above then he said as we have taken the ly body so we shall also take the Heavenly so now when we are born from Ab when we are born from Heaven because the second Lord the second man the second Adam is the Lord From Heaven so by Jesus Christ we are born of his Spirit praise the name of our Lord so then you are born again you are born from Heaven praise the name of our Lord so then the baptism of the holy spirit makes you to be born again and now when you are born again then you can testify my citizenship is in heaven praise the name of our Lord my citizenship is in heaven you look at Abraham God told him the country of your parents come to the land I'm going to show you and then the Bible says when Abraham reached Canan he was in Canan as a stranger yet God had given him that country but he knew in Canan he knew that being in Canan there was fine there was sickness there was death there were Wars so he looked for a he looked for a city who build and make his where there's no sickness where there's no sorrow where there's no death where there's no fing praise the name of our Lord and the Bible says he stayed in that country waiting praise the name of our Lord then even others Isaac came also looking for that then when jaob came there was fing in the land and then Jacob had to go to Egypt and when Jacob went to Egypt he met with pharaoh and Pharaoh asked him how old are you then he told Pharaoh the days of my prage can you imagine a person is 100 and something like that that there are few days compared to my fathers so even Jacob knew this is not the land that we inherit forever so our inheritance is in Christ praise the name of our Lord and until we are born in Christ we can't receive that inheritance praise the name of our Lord the Bible says our inheritances in Christ let us go to Ephesians chapter 1 praise the name of our Lord Ephesians chapter 1 and then we'll read in verse let us start from verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works on things after the C of his own will praise the name of the Lord so until you are born in Christ by the New Birth by the B of the Holy Spirit you have no inheritance in but when you are born in him then you have inheritance in just like the natural way you don't go to your neighbor because he's having a lot and then you say neighbor now you're my father now I need my inheritance you don't do that it's until you are born in that family so even us until we are born from Christ that's when we can have an inheritance praise the name of I know Pastor was preaching here about the trees being intertwined now if you are on the tree of the devil you can't get inheritance from the Tree of Christ praise the name of our can't be so we need to be born in the kingdom of God to have inheritance from ch now the Bible says in verse 12 of Ephesians 1 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ whom also you trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of yourself salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise praise the name of the Lord so he says when we believe and obedient to the gospel he seals you with the Holy Spirit of promise and then the Holy Spirit of Promise is the Hest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory he says he gives us the honest the down payment which is the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit declaring to us that there is more to come more of what Christ redeemed is coming but then the holy spirit gives us an assurance that we are his children gives us an assurance that we are not of our own but we are owned by God the Holy Ghost gives us an by sealing Our Lives praise the name of our Lord then we can say our citizenship is in heaven we are strangers here on Earth but we are not strangers in heaven we have been born in heaven praise the name of our Lord we have been born from above so when time on Earth is over the Bible says he has a body waiting praise the name of the Lord there is a body of theophany that when you leave this Natural Body you get into the body in heaven and now the Bible says the body in heaven is eternal so how can I know that my body is there when I receive the Holy Spirit identifies that there is a body waiting for that there is a waiting praise the name of our Lord I come to get to know about it that oh there is a body waiting for me praise the name of our Lord so we need to be born again be born of the Holy Spirit receive the spirit of Christ Living in you praise the name of our Lord let the Holy Ghost take over our lives that we don't live by our own selves but we live by the grace of God praise the name of our Lord and you know the holy spirit is not far praise the name of the Lord the holy spirit is not far you know the Bible says don't say who shall go in heaven to bring him down or who shall go down in hell to bring him up what does the Bible say in Romans chapter 10 praise the name of our Lord Romans chapter 10 and then verse six but the righteousness which is of Faith speaks on this wise say not in thine heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ from the dead and what is Christ anointed which anointing the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord so don't say the Holy Ghost is in heaven the Holy Ghost is in hell I don't know where I can get the Holy Ghost you don't say like that praise the name of the Lord like some scenarios the devil can put in your mind you say now when are we going to have a convention you know when the convention comes that's when we get you know those anointed preachers don't in ging we no longer have conversions the Bible says don't say that praise the name of the Lord God I wish I was there the day of Pentecost I not know whether I have the Holy Ghost or not also be among there and I see the fire there and I I have the Holy Ghost the Bible says don't say like that so God I wish I was there in the days of brother and then I go in the prayer line then he says now you wanting the Holy Ghost I receive the Holy Ghost oh God I wish I was there the Bible says don't say like that praise the name of the Lord oh now they organizing another meeting it's going to be now I don't have transport I don't know what to do the Bible says don't like what does the Bible say verse seven rather verse eight but what sayth it the word is near thee even in thine mouth and in thine heart that is the word of fa which we preach how far is your mouth from you how far is your heart from you praise the name of our Lord now the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord started working on your life the day you accepted the Lord Jesus as your P you didn't accept Jesus as your savior by your own ability Bible says salvation is of the lord it's God that brought the preacher there the Bible says that Philip Philip let us go to acts acts chap 8 verse 26 and the angel of the Lord spoke un Philip saying arise and go to one the South and the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza which is Desert and he arose and went and behold a man of ethopia a un of great Authority Under candas queen of ethopians who had charge over all her treasure had come to Jerusalem for to worship and was returning and sitting in his Chariot read ASAS the prophet spirit said unto Philip go near join thyself to this Chariot praise the name of the Lord who was telling Philip to go there the angel told him go when he saw the Chariot the Holy Spirit told Philip join that Chariot so it was the Holy Spirit that used philli to preach so even when you hear the word of God the Hest spirit that is speaking to you so how far is the holy ghost from you so he says don't go don't say who go in heaven to bring Christ down who go in hell to K him from down the holy spirit is the one that brings you to conviction of your sin the Holy Ghost is the one that gives you the ability to accept the Lord Jesus as your personal savior so how f is the Holy Ghost and the holy spirit is the one that justifies you it's the Holy Spirit the same holy spirit is the one that sanctifies you how far is the Holy Ghost you mean you stopped those things by your own it was the spirit of God giving you the ability to live those things so it has been the Holy Spirit working upon your life from the time you had the gospel and when you are going to destruction you turned your back away from the evil things and started going this direction it is the Hest spirit is the Holy Ghost working upon your life so don't just imagine he's so far from me no the thing you need to do is allow the spirit to continue doing his work in your life that's all you need to do surrendering yourself obeying the word you are obeying the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord and the more you surrender the more the Holy Ghost takes over your life the more you read the word of God more the Holy Ghost changes your thinking is the more the Holy Ghost changes your speech the more the Holy Ghost changes your confession and you find that you are completely changed even your life you live Romans chapter 12 let us go there and read verse one praise the name of our Lord I besch you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service so he says offer your bodies yield your bodies as a sacrifice that is ho acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service praise the name of our Lord then verse two and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that which is good acceptable the perfect will of God and brother Brandon preaches a message on God's power of transformation it is the holy ghost that transforms us from a sinner to the righteous person you don't do it by yourself but you just yield yourself and then the Holy Ghost Works upon you and then he brings you into His Image praise the name of our Lord you learn to surrender you learn to yield if you are doing something wrong then the spirit of God tells you it's wrong then you turn from that wrong thing and start following that which is right what is happening you are being transformed by the power of God and the more you yield yourself the more only ghost takes over your life in John chapter 15 praise the name of our Lord he says without me you can do nothing salvation is of the Lord so we need to allow the Lord do his finished work praise the name of our Lord in John 15 verse 5 I am the vine and you are the branches he that abideth me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing praise the name of our Lord we just need to learn how to surrender to Christ every

remembering the death of our Lord Jesus Christ and the resurrection for it is through the death of our Lord Jesus Christ that will receive eternal life and Lord you left us these ordinances observe that it can be always in our mind so Lord now we commit this communion night into your hands that father you may come and lead us through it Lord and observe according to your word what you've given unto us Lord may you bless father all the things we are going to use the unleavened bread the alar wine and then later on the foot washing that you may be with us through these processes father and bless us in such a special Lord for the obedience to your word we commit ourselves into your hands we pray that your purpose may be done Lord we love you and we thank you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus ask this amen am let us turn to our Bibles First Corinthians chapter 11 he says in verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betro took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the the cup when he had sted saying this is the cup the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord is death till he come wherefor soever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unw worthly shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord but a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh and worthly eateth and drinketh domination of himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many Sleep God blessing of his word we may be seated praise the name of our Lord so tonight is a night we are going to observe the Lord supper and normally we use the unleavened bread you only get the FL of whe FL and then you mix it just with water and then you bake it you don't put there oil or any other thing and then for wine we get the alar wine now in the denominations they get maybe Tip Top bread which has living in it and then they get F now those don't present the things of Christ and we Des that we observe this every month but as the Lord gives us the grace we shall be doing that praise the name of alone and also just the same thing you first eat then you drink so they first ate then they drun so we have the bread here before us 11 bread and we are going to see that we break it praise the name of not the secular things like for the Catholics but this one is broken the body of Christ was pierced praise the name of the Lord the body of Christ was bruised praise the name of our Lord and all these are symbols actually and now the Bible say we examine ourselves if you are worthy you know your personal walk are you worthy now if you find you're not worthy you can ask God for Mercy to make you Worthy on our own we are not worthy but we are only worthy by the blood of Jesus Christ and that's why now you bring the blood of Jesus Christ in your stuation to make you worthy now if somebody here who has never accepted the Lord Jesus as their personal savior he first needs to accept the Lord Jesus as their personal savior somebody has not been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he also P to be baptized in the name of Jesus so if you find that you you have not accepted the Lord Jesus as your personal you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't partake of it praise the name of the Lord because it's not just a religious fulfillment of a ceremony but we need to do it following the footsteps of the Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so call Brother William Brother wison to come so you just keep yourself under meditation [Music] it's different [Music] [Music] [Music] in [Music] than [Music]
