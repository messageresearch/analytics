[0:00] Now in Uganda
[0:02] [Music]
[0:16] all
[0:19] [Music]
[0:26] hallelujah.
[0:28] Oh,
[0:34] once more
[0:40] never
[0:47] [Music]
[0:50] just close your eyes and
[0:53] say a word of prayer to the Lord.
[0:57] If we if you are all so glad that he set
[1:00] us free,
[1:02] his mercy searched for you and he found
[1:06] you. You didn't seek him, he looked for
[1:10] you. All the ditches wherever we were,
[1:14] the mercies of the Lord that I knew
[1:17] every morning. He has never closed that
[1:20] door of mercy. He's always calling on
[1:23] us. Whoever is heavy is burdened, just
[1:27] come to him because his arms of grace
[1:31] are wide open.
[1:33] Heavenly Father, we thank you for this
[1:36] moment. Lord, we are not the best out
[1:39] there. We are not worthy. Father, you
[1:42] found us
[1:44] and you called us, Lord, Father, to be
[1:47] your sons, not give your glory. You
[1:50] ordained us, Father, to be who we are.
[1:52] And father we pray this evening that may
[1:55] you come oh God and minister to this
[1:57] seed that you put in us Lord come change
[2:00] us Lord come continue to mold us Lord
[2:03] for we have declare into your hands Lord
[2:06] that father you mold us into what you
[2:08] want us to be heavenly father I lay my
[2:11] brothers and sisters here this evening
[2:14] and those on online father the lord the
[2:16] king of glory you may come Lord and
[2:19] minister to each one of them may you
[2:22] answer their prayers. Lord, may you
[2:24] grant them at their points of needing of
[2:26] glory. Father, maybe some are sick,
[2:28] Lord, were afflicted in one way or the
[2:30] other. Father, for you search the heart
[2:32] and you know each and everything that
[2:35] every person is going through. I pray
[2:37] even father for the word that may you
[2:40] come and grant to bless us. Oh heavenly
[2:42] father, for without you, we can't get
[2:45] anything out of it. You are the one that
[2:47] gives the revelation. You are the one
[2:49] that opens the word. Heavenly Father, we
[2:51] call on you God that father as you lead
[2:53] us through the song service. May you
[2:55] continuously father come and minister to
[2:58] us Lord. We pray for our pastors Lord.
[3:01] We pray for all the ministers here. We
[3:03] pray for all father the leaders in this
[3:05] church Lord that you may cause a
[3:07] blessing upon each one of them. In the
[3:09] name of our Lord our savior Jesus Christ
[3:11] we pray. Amen.
[3:14] Amen. Let's go to the book of Job.
[3:20] The book of Job.
[3:24] Praise the name of the Lord.
[3:26] Uh time has really gone, but
[3:30] &gt;&gt; we shall use that God has given us.
[3:35] The prophet says
[3:38] that God does not use what he has not
[3:40] given us.
[3:43] If he calls for something from us,
[3:47] that means he has given it to us.
[3:50] That's where David stood
[3:54] and said, "All that I'm giving you is
[3:56] what you gave me."
[3:58] So, I'm giving you of what is yours.
[4:03] Praise the name of the Lord. So let's
[4:05] turn to the book of Job chapter 8
[4:09] and then verse
[4:13] [Music]
[5:11] Oh my goodness.
[6:04] that grows in a muddy wet, you know,
[6:07] swamp areas.
[6:11] And that's what Maya means.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; And then flag
[6:23] means uh it's a species of plant that
[6:26] grows on water
[6:30] and indeed without water
[6:33] you cannot find a flag.
[6:36] So without you know muddy or swampy
[6:39] areas
[6:41] you can find rush.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the lord.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; So using this scripture
[6:49] I just pray that you know we get an
[6:51] aspect or concept of growth
[6:56] that for anything to grow
[6:59] there are some conditions that they have
[7:00] to meet
[7:02] and we know that growth is a is a
[7:05] principle of god.
[7:08] that anything with life
[7:11] will grow as long as it is in the right
[7:14] condition.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So growth
[7:19] can only be mentioned
[7:22] where there is a seed
[7:24] and this seed here has life. Praise the
[7:28] name of the Lord. Because you can talk
[7:31] about a seed
[7:33] and a seed means, you know,
[7:37] a
[7:38] something that has life or something
[7:40] that can bring forth another.
[7:46] But yet there are seeds
[7:48] that do not have life. Some of these
[7:51] seeds
[7:53] are manufactured in the machines
[7:57] and some of them
[7:59] during their growth
[8:01] maybe they did get some nutrients.
[8:05] So we can't talk about growth
[8:08] without a seed and a seed with life.
[8:13] So a seed means a storage of life
[8:18] and a seed without life
[8:21] cannot grow. It can only be used for
[8:24] food
[8:26] decoration
[8:29] and any other purpose. Praise the name
[8:31] of the Lord. So in in an in a dictionary
[8:37] English man you know defines a seed
[8:41] as a self-contained package.
[8:45] Praise the name of the Lord. So this
[8:48] seed here it is self-contained
[8:52] and it's a package that has genetical
[8:55] you know materials
[8:59] for a plant.
[9:01] So when you talk about mice,
[9:04] when you talk about mice,
[9:08] mice, mice.
[9:11] So for you to to have mice
[9:14] and to find it genetical material,
[9:18] it is found in it seed.
[9:21] For a m seal
[9:27] material,
[9:29] praise the name of the lord.
[9:31] He continues and says
[9:34] &gt;&gt; that this seed here has an embryo
[9:39] &gt;&gt; and an embryo
[9:41] &gt;&gt; is a tiny unveloped plant
[9:46] that is contained within this seed.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So in the
[9:51] seed also
[9:53] we find the stored food
[9:56] and all that is protected by a court.
[10:02] which is called a seed coat.
[10:05] So all these things here they are they
[10:08] are designed
[10:10] to bring forth life
[10:13] of the same species
[10:16] when it is planted
[10:19] in the right atmosphere.
[10:21] Praise the name of the Lord. So a seed,
[10:25] the main purpose for a seed is to bring
[10:28] forth reproduction.
[10:30] Praise the name of the Lord. So this
[10:32] evening as we take on this subject, I
[10:36] want us to look at the seed as the word
[10:40] of God and the seed as you the
[10:44] individual seed
[10:46] Abraham.
[10:48] Praise the name of the Lord. I want us
[10:50] to pick a quote here.
[10:53] show us the father where the prophet was
[10:56] talking about two kinds of seeds
[11:00] made in a machine
[11:03] that is spoken of God.
[11:06] He say so notice
[11:09] while he was there the radio was on in
[11:12] the little confectionary
[11:15] and and old Dr. Spun, a very fine friend
[11:19] of mine.
[11:22] And so the radio was on
[11:31] and the little 4 club in Louisville,
[11:34] Kentucky had a machine over there
[11:39] that they had made
[11:41] that could reproduce a grain of corn
[11:45] so perfect that you couldn't tell it
[11:47] from one grown in the field.
[11:52] You take a handful of of the sack
[11:57] that's grown in the field
[12:01] and a handful out of the sack
[12:04] that the machine produced
[12:08] them together
[12:10] and you would never tell them apart
[12:12] again
[12:14] at any size. You cut them open.
[12:19] The same amount of calcium,
[12:22] the same amount of moisture
[12:26] just right.
[12:28] It would make the same cornmeal
[12:31] and the same corn bread,
[12:34] the same conflicts
[12:37] just exactly.
[12:40] There is only one way you could you
[12:42] could ever tell them apart.
[12:46] that's bury them
[12:48] and the one that that the machine made
[12:51] rot
[12:55] and never live again but the one that
[12:58] God made lives again
[13:02] because it's got life in it.
[13:06] Praise the name of the Lord. So the
[13:08] prophet is telling us
[13:10] &gt;&gt; that there are two seeds.
[13:12] One seed that is made in a machine
[13:15] and one which is spoken of God that is
[13:17] grown.
[13:19] One has life and the other does not have
[13:22] life. The only way to know that this
[13:26] seed has life when you bury it. One with
[13:30] life will grow and another without life
[13:35] it cannot grow. And so the prophet
[13:37] continues down paragraph 44
[13:41] about you and I and says you can take a
[13:45] man that looks like a Christian
[13:49] like a Christian but if that man hasn't
[13:51] got the word of God in him if there
[13:54] isn't a life in there
[13:58] is that he will never rise in the
[14:00] resurrection.
[14:03] is right because he can't rise.
[14:08] Praise the name of the Lord. So we see
[14:11] here that any seed that has life, it
[14:16] will grow. Praise the name of the Lord,
[14:19] it says every person that has a life, a
[14:23] life of God, will grow. Praise the name
[14:27] of the Lord. So as we continue with the
[14:31] rush seed
[14:33] with the rush seed,
[14:36] &gt;&gt; the rush seed
[14:39] in the way that it grows, we see that it
[14:42] needs moisture,
[14:45] it needs soil contact.
[14:50] So when you get a seed in your home
[14:53] and you put it down on the floor, it
[14:55] will not grow as though it has life. And
[15:00] when you put it in the garden,
[15:03] soils that you have filed very well,
[15:08] it will bring life.
[15:10] Let's pick up here in the book of Luke
[15:13] chapter 8.
[15:17] Praise the name of the Lord.
[15:24] Luke chapter 8
[15:26] and then verse 11.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "Now the parable is this,
[15:32] the seed is the word
[15:34] by the wayside are they that hear
[15:39] then cometh the devil and taketh away
[15:42] the word out of their hearts. Least they
[15:44] should be least they should believe and
[15:46] be saved.
[15:56] Praise the name of the Lord. Jesus was
[15:59] talking about a seed. The seed that
[16:02] Jesus was talking about
[16:04] with life. Praise the name of the Lord.
[16:07] A seed with life. When you put it on the
[16:10] west side, you cannot grow. And that's
[16:14] what Jesus says. The birds come and take
[16:18] it away.
[16:20] A type of a Christian that has sat in
[16:22] the sanctuary
[16:24] hearing the word yet is thinking about
[16:27] something else
[16:29] about his businesses to think about his
[16:32] education. He think about his welfares
[16:35] at home
[16:37] of other things. Jesus is telling us
[16:40] that the birth of Babylon will come and
[16:43] take away the sin.
[16:46] does not grow.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; And then he continues down
[16:50] verse 13 that they on the rock are they
[16:53] which when they hear receive the word
[16:56] with joy and these have no root which
[16:59] for which for a while believe and in
[17:02] time of temptation they fall away.
[17:19] Praise the name of the Lord. I want you
[17:21] to get from this scripture here
[17:24] that it's not just about having a seat
[17:29] with life.
[17:31] The conditions
[17:32] of the bedding ground
[17:35] matters a lot. Praise the name of the
[17:38] Lord. The condition of the ground where
[17:40] you are putting your seed
[17:43] matters a lot on the fusion of this
[17:45] seed.
[17:47] So he says when you put on the rock
[17:51] it may be to grow because maybe there is
[17:54] some sw
[17:56] but because it has no place to put it
[18:01] wither. Praise the name of the Lord. In
[18:04] verse 14, he says, "And that which fell
[18:07] among thorns,
[18:14] &gt;&gt; are they which when they which when they
[18:17] have heard go forth and are chocked with
[18:20] cares and riches and pleasures of this
[18:22] life, and you bring no fruit to
[18:25] perfection.
[18:33] never.
[18:50] Praise the name of the Lord. These are
[18:52] they that think about the things of the
[18:56] world.
[18:58] And John calls them
[19:00] the lust of the flesh,
[19:04] the lust of the eye
[19:06] and the pride of life.
[19:08] Sometimes he's, you know, he has the
[19:10] right seed in him
[19:13] because of lack of food.
[19:16] He has his birthight
[19:18] to get what to eat. Maybe he has what to
[19:20] eat. He has the chaos. He has what to
[19:24] put on,
[19:26] but he wants to make more money.
[19:29] get the riches of the world. He sells
[19:32] his birthight
[19:34] yet the riches of the world
[19:36] to get a job and he compromises on his
[19:39] way of life
[19:42] a job. Praise the name of the Lord. He
[19:45] says that chalks the tree
[19:48] and he does not bring forth good healthy
[19:51] fruit.
[19:53] And he talks about the pleasures
[19:56] I've got. I have the chaos.
[20:00] I have the riches.
[20:02] And now I am going to enjoy life.
[20:06] Calls the pride of life.
[20:10] Enjoy your life.
[20:12] You may have your friends out there.
[20:15] Go out with them. Enjoy life. Why you
[20:19] enjoying life? You're walking contrary
[20:22] to the word of God,
[20:25] but you know, you're selling out your
[20:27] birthright.
[20:29] Praise the name of the Lord. So he
[20:31] continues and says in verse 15,
[20:34] on the good ground are they which in
[20:38] honest and good heart, having heard the
[20:40] word, keep it and bring forth fruit with
[20:43] patience.
[20:55] Praise the name of the Lord. I believe
[20:58] our prayer this evening
[21:00] is for us to to stand in this scripture
[21:04] of our lives. Praise the name of the
[21:06] Lord. The ground has been broken
[21:10] and you know it's ready for planting.
[21:14] And when you put a seed there,
[21:16] There is nothing it does
[21:19] to grow. And when it grows, God wers it
[21:23] with the Holy Spirit.
[21:26] It grows forth as a plant planted by the
[21:30] rivers of water
[21:33] in it.
[21:36] So the prophet the message God's only
[21:39] provided place of worship.
[21:43] The word of God has a seed and size.
[21:47] praying is great author of this book.
[21:52] It is a seed.
[21:55] We are taught that a sour sword
[21:59] say the author.
[22:02] We do realize that a seed will grow if
[22:04] it's in the right kind of ground.
[22:09] You this morning take all the prayers
[22:13] and theos
[22:15] and unbelief
[22:17] [Music]
[22:19] and skeptical
[22:22] out of our hearts
[22:24] that the word of God might grow freely
[22:29] by the spirit in our heart
[22:33] that we might be
[22:37] when we come pray that God takes away
[22:40] the prayers.
[22:44] has been found
[22:49] here on India. He says
[22:54] the Holy Spirit which will produce the
[22:56] signs of Mark 16.
[23:16] of the only way
[23:20] it is in your heart when it grow and a
[23:24] heart that is a good ground
[23:28] here
[23:30] accept.
[24:24] went fall into the ground.
[24:29] And then when the word is brought into a
[24:31] heart of faith,
[24:35] every promise in the Bible again
[24:39] the Lord the word is brought heart of
[24:43] Christ
[24:45] putting it in the heart,
[24:47] not holding the word with
[24:50] this
[24:52] brings it into
[24:54] when there is fight in there
[24:57] of God.
[24:59] the promise
[25:01] withering. You're not
[25:04] walking in the promise.
[25:07] God, you said so.
[25:10] I said, God, you said so.
[25:17] And the prophet continues and says here,
[25:20] God lives.
[25:22] Word
[25:24] must live if it is received in the right
[25:26] place.
[25:28] condition
[25:30] when you leave a guy
[25:32] put under the right condition.
[25:36] It is not about the life in you
[25:39] condition around.
[25:41] You see, and then he lies down. And
[25:44] brethren, may I say this, reverence and
[25:48] respect you as my brethren,
[25:51] &gt;&gt; knowing that maybe before night,
[25:54] we stand at the judgment seat of Christ.
[25:56] You know,
[26:00] and listen, see what he says down.
[26:02] Brother, can you scroll it down?
[26:06] He says it's the atmosphere
[26:10] that brings forth the product.
[26:13] You see it is the atmosphere
[26:17] that brings the product. They might have
[26:20] 100 seats of mice.
[26:23] Something is not right
[26:28] and sometimes they may grow and they
[26:31] will stand
[26:34] because the atmosphere
[26:36] does not favor the growth of this seed.
[26:41] The name of God. Now let's pick up
[26:43] Galatians chapter 3.
[26:48] Galatians 3:16,
[26:51] he says, "Now to Abraham,
[26:54] and his seed were the promises made. He
[26:56] saith not to seeds as of many, but as of
[27:00] one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.
[27:14] Praise the name of the Lord. Getting
[27:17] back to Genesis chapter 15,
[27:20] God opened the heavens.
[27:23] Opened the sky
[27:25] and showed Abraham,
[27:27] all the stars that you're seeing up
[27:29] there, that is your seed. God was
[27:33] talking about you and I.
[27:36] seed Abraham shall be as many as
[27:42] the name of the Lord. And God was
[27:44] talking about a seed
[27:47] coming through the sun Christ
[27:57] seed that seed was the person of Christ.
[28:02] Christ came and down in the book of John
[28:05] 12 verse 20
[28:09] came as Andrew
[28:12] would want to see Jesus Christ the seed
[28:15] that Abraham spoke that God spoke to
[28:17] Abraham about
[28:20] praise the name of the Lord Jesus the
[28:24] seed that was that was talked about
[28:28] for himself
[28:30] he said unless Yes.
[28:33] The corn of which falls into the ground
[28:37] looking at you
[28:39] looking at you sister.
[28:41] There is a seed that we must look at the
[28:45] word of the Lord. Jesus was not looking
[28:47] at the individual seed that he was.
[28:50] Jesus
[28:52] but it is until that seed is planted.
[28:57] Praise the name of the Lord. The
[28:59] scripture says in the book of John
[29:02] chapter 22
[29:04] and then he says Philip cometh and
[29:05] tellth Andrew and again Andrew and
[29:08] Philip tell Jesus. And Jesus answered
[29:11] them saying the hour is come that the
[29:13] son of go that the son of man shall be
[29:16] glorified. And then he says very I say
[29:19] unto you except a corn of it fall into
[29:22] the ground and die it abadeth alone. Uh,
[29:26] Philippise
[29:46] God. Now the question to us this
[29:48] evening, if Jesus did not look at
[29:52] himself as the individual that he was
[29:55] living
[29:56] that was pointing,
[30:00] how much more other people
[30:03] is looking for Christ looking for you. I
[30:06] have a seed inside of me to grow another
[30:10] seed
[30:12] and produce the same life
[30:16] because Jesus talking about the seed
[30:18] coming after him.
[30:21] Just like when you have a seed of maze
[30:22] in your house
[30:25] is not talking about yourself alone.
[30:27] He's talking about others of mind and
[30:29] have plant this seed here.
[30:35] Now here in the book of Galatians
[30:38] was talking about a seed Christ
[30:42] and says we are the seed of Christ.
[30:44] Likewise, no principle.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Now listen what he says here in the book
[30:51] of Galatians
[30:53] and then chapter 3
[30:56] verse 27. He says, "For as many of you
[31:00] as have been baptized into Christ have
[31:03] put on Christ.
[31:12] There is neither Jew nor Greek. There is
[31:15] neither bond nor free. There is neither
[31:17] male nor female. For ye are all in one
[31:21] in Christ.
[31:35] So Paul is trying to say
[31:37] as long as you've come
[31:40] and you have accepted the Lord Jesus
[31:42] Christ,
[31:43] you've been baptized into Christ
[31:46] and being baptized into Christ
[31:49] just burying you in water.
[31:52] That's the beginning. The coming down of
[31:54] the Holy Ghost
[31:56] brings you into the seat of God
[31:59] in the name of the Lord. That's why Paul
[32:02] said, "If the spirit of him that raised
[32:05] up Jesus
[32:08] from the dead dwell in you, he that
[32:11] raised up Christ
[32:13] from the dead shall also quicken your
[32:17] that was in Christ.
[32:23] I hear
[32:29] the name of the Lord. You are the people
[32:32] that Christ spoke of my sheep hear my
[32:35] word.
[32:37] They hear when I call them and they
[32:40] follow me. He said, "I lay down my life.
[32:44] No one takes it away. But when I lay it
[32:48] up and I lay it down,
[32:53] no one can take it away from me.
[32:56] No one can take it away. The ship that
[32:58] Jesus was talking about
[33:02] comes and take up Christ
[33:05] and there
[33:15] are
[33:18] Christ and through Christ comes you and
[33:21] I
[33:23] by the Holy Spirit.
[33:27] Sorry. Who would ask God
[33:31] of the Lord and he contin
[33:40] same children with being dead in Christ
[33:44] Abraham
[33:45] and according to promise to
[33:52] God
[33:57] and the name of the Lord Christ and
[34:00] through Christ
[34:02] and that brings us into the government
[34:05] of the promises
[34:08] but you are the head of all
[34:11] you are not as
[34:13] standing the promises
[34:15] he promises
[34:18] not to be a hair you were born a hair
[34:22] when you sick not to pray no healing
[34:26] what belongs to you.
[34:28] When you need a blessing from God,
[34:31] what does not belong to you?
[34:35] The name of the Lord. And now realizing
[34:38] the word of God is in
[34:40] knowing that the word of God of God
[34:46] has told us the word until it is put in
[34:50] the ground
[34:52] that is on the inside. word of God
[34:55] receive it in the book.
[35:00] Praise the name of the Lord. I hope we
[35:01] can relate the scripture
[35:05] looking at the name and looking at the
[35:07] word to look at ourselves even
[35:20] to see that we just run through by the
[35:22] grace of God.
[35:23] If newborn babies desire the sincere
[35:26] meaning of the word that you may grow
[35:27] thereby okay
[35:30] sorry
[35:32] if so be you have tested that the Lord
[35:34] is gracious
[35:45] praise the name of the lord Peter is
[35:48] speaking to us because Peter knows my
[35:50] son the seed of Abraham
[35:53] that can receive the word in the name of
[35:55] the Lord
[35:56] speak to everyone
[36:01] where his genes
[36:05] are of God
[36:08] when the word is being preached
[36:11] Jesus on the inside of you praise the
[36:13] name of the prophecy when Christ was on
[36:16] the cross he was not there for the
[36:19] entire people of the world he was there
[36:20] for the it
[36:25] was talking to
[36:28] Christ.
[36:29] Therefore, you have to grow
[36:33] fire
[36:46] on
[36:48] the second Verse 18
[36:52] says, "But grow in grace and in the
[36:54] knowledge of God and Jesus Christ. To
[36:57] him be glory both now and forever."
[37:00] Second Peter 3:18. Second Peter. Okay.
[37:06] Praise the name of the Lord.
[37:21] Amen.
[37:23] So in the in the previous scripture
[37:26] growing by reading on the word of God
[37:29] but now he's telling us growing in what?
[37:33] Growing in education
[37:35] growing in the word growing in the
[37:37] fashionist
[37:40] talking about growing in grace and in
[37:43] the knowledge of our Lord Jesus.
[37:47] the other morning. You realize that you
[37:49] are not worthy
[37:51] because you know once you know that you
[37:53] have done something
[37:55] yourself
[37:59] in the name of the Lord as the prophet
[38:00] says
[38:02] choosing law
[38:04] anything to make
[38:08] it
[38:14] for every other day
[38:17] when came to him and preach to David was
[38:21] a man
[38:24] and David was not understanding
[38:27] broke the
[38:29] knew that he was the man. He went into a
[38:32] thinking and he went into his wives.
[38:36] He went to a searching moment
[38:39] and then he came up with Psalm 51.
[38:43] I was I was born realize man. So it is
[38:49] the breath of God that brought us where
[38:50] we are
[38:54] from there. But when you realize that it
[38:56] is the god grow in that that you can
[38:59] share the same grace your neighbor
[39:02] says we must grow in the grace of God
[39:05] and the knowledge of the person of not
[39:07] the person of the world
[39:09] knowledge of the person of
[39:12] the knowled Jesus Christ about reading
[39:14] the law
[39:17] of the person of Christ knowing him
[39:20] the name of the
[39:23] firstian chapter
[39:25] size
[39:27] 131.
[45:30] Jesus
[45:32] in the world
[45:39] was talking to a church who was not
[45:41] growing
[45:43] and grace of the pastor of God.
[45:49] that hear the word
[45:51] taken by the
[45:56] thinking about their businesses
[45:59] about their
[46:03] word of the Lord
[46:06] as good as they came
[46:10] that has been done in their life.
[46:16] time to feed on the word
[46:21] of God. These are people that you know
[46:26] leave the word of God
[46:29] in the Bible and they don't feed on the
[46:32] word.
[46:40] Praise the name of the Lord. Are you
[46:42] friends? The word of God has life and it
[46:47] must
[46:50] even
[46:59] atmosphere.
[47:00] Praise the name of the Lord. pick up the
[47:03] prophet here in the message that
[47:07] he says therefore
[47:09] if you just come
[47:12] say I offer Jesus Christ my life
[47:16] and you've never received the Holy Ghost
[47:21] come into it
[47:24] you must do it
[47:26] you must grow into it
[47:31] on top of
[47:34] like that until you become the full of a
[47:38] son of God
[47:42] of God
[47:43] taking the things of the world.
[47:47] First John says, if you love the world,
[47:51] the things of the world, it is because
[47:53] the love of God is not even in you.
[47:56] You've been deceived.
[47:58] You got the love of the world there.
[48:01] It has deceived you. The devil has by
[48:05] pinging things things on on onto there
[48:10] and showing see
[48:12] and then you cannot take one word of God
[48:15] out of the Bible
[48:18] by the name of the Lord. The prophet is
[48:20] telling us
[48:22] the only way you can grow when you word
[48:26] upon word.
[48:30] Ask God
[48:33] word upon word.
[48:36] Put word of God upon the word of God
[48:40] of the world here.
[48:45] The person of the world,
[48:48] putting the word of God on the word of
[48:50] God in a way.
[48:54] And then he says here that the devil has
[48:57] deceived us.
[48:59] You know by making us think that you can
[49:02] put one leg here
[49:06] walk in the middle of the line. He
[49:10] continues and says here he says what
[49:12] caused the first sin
[49:15] &gt;&gt; not by just a big point blank lie
[49:18] but because miscon con constitute. The
[49:22] devil did it to her. One word. One word
[49:26] broke the child and refused to take one
[49:29] word. That was the beginning of the
[49:30] Bible.
[49:32] [Music]
[49:41] that you see you can have this here.
[49:44] Just go and listen
[49:47] it upon here and after it go back
[49:55] the time that you meant to read the word
[49:56] of God
[50:03] before you leave the birds have eaten
[50:06] the word.
[50:07] Sometimes you go back and you have the
[50:10] word on the inside of you. Jesus told us
[50:14] and they receive the word and they go
[50:16] out rejoicing.
[50:18] God has spoken to my heart. God has
[50:21] blessed me. But in the morning there was
[50:24] no for for the word to put the root.
[50:30] It is choked.
[50:32] It withers away.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; And what do you do? The de the devil
[50:36] deceives you and you add on the world.
[50:40] Yet there is a life on the inside
[50:44] but because of the condition
[50:46] of the things that you're living in
[50:49] allowing the sick
[50:51] to grow. Let's pick up here in the
[50:54] message thirsting for life.
[50:58] He says I wish to read just some now
[51:01] from the Bible.
[51:03] [Music]
[51:05] I just love the reading of the word.
[51:09] And then he says,
[51:11] &gt;&gt; you know, the Holy Spirit
[51:13] feeds on the word.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "It is written,
[51:19] man shall not live by bread alone."
[51:24] And by every word that proceedth out of
[51:26] the mouth of God,
[51:30] you just take it each day.
[51:34] You see where the emphasis is
[51:37] the word each day
[51:40] taking it only on Sunday.
[51:45] And then he says
[51:47] &gt;&gt; not as just a routine
[51:50] but just I would say to just make it
[51:53] that your heart craves for it
[51:58] to just sit down each day
[52:02] to read so much out of the Bible.
[52:05] It says you will be surprised
[52:07] what do spiritual growth.
[52:11] It will certainly it certainly will. Man
[52:14] shall not live by bread.
[52:18] You will be surprised
[52:20] when you continue in the word
[52:24] upon the word.
[52:26] Go back and read the word of the Lord.
[52:29] Get on the word of the Lord. Try to walk
[52:32] in the word of the Lord.
[52:34] God
[52:36] you in his way
[52:38] of the word the revealer of the wording
[52:42] it as a routine.
[52:44] Draw a calendar
[52:47] and say by every day we read the word at
[52:49] this time
[52:51] but craving for it
[52:54] because the nature the deep on the
[52:56] inside
[52:58] is calling for the deep.
[53:00] He says here in in another message
[53:03] planting the void.
[53:08] He says because that unbelief
[53:11] the cares of the world
[53:14] has bound the people
[53:17] until it cannot produce spirit of God.
[53:21] You see the problem the cares of the
[53:23] world
[53:27] it has bounded the people.
[53:30] It is not that they don't have the life.
[53:32] The life is on the inside
[53:35] of the cares.
[53:38] You see, it has bound the people until
[53:42] it cannot produce spiritual growth.
[53:47] That's what's the matter with our
[53:50] nation.
[53:52] That's the matter with our churches.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; They have no joy.
[53:58] The joy of the Lord has departed
[54:01] repeated one time in scripture. The
[54:05] Hebrew word of
[54:11] the presence of the Lord has departed.
[54:15] They no longer crave for the word.
[54:18] They are traditional religious people
[54:22] in the name of the Lord stand at a
[54:24] certain level.
[54:26] They are not growing
[54:28] because the Bible is not close to their
[54:31] hearts.
[54:34] They pray for for other things of the
[54:36] world
[54:37] and they are not craving
[54:39] for the word of God.
[54:42] You see that's why they not have time
[54:46] for coming for service.
[54:50] the prophet side that some people on
[54:54] Wednesday evening
[54:56] they put on a soap
[55:00] a TV
[55:01] to watch than going to church
[55:05] and then they say we are Christians
[55:08] because they are traditional
[55:11] Christians.
[55:13] Isaiah stood there
[55:16] &gt;&gt; and told the people that these
[55:18] sacrifices that God ordained himself,
[55:23] they are an abomination to them
[55:26] because they were offering them
[55:29] the tradition.
[55:31] It is se to be a revelation
[55:35] to be
[55:37] that they prayed for.
[55:39] So the prophet continues here and says
[55:46] that's over our churches
[55:52] &gt;&gt; because that we have left off of the
[55:54] original foundation
[55:58] and placed ourselves into creeds
[56:02] and denominations
[56:04] and permitted the things of the world
[56:07] to dry Yeah.
[56:09] Our experience with God.
[56:13] So when we walk
[56:15] each
[56:19] has departed.
[56:21] Praise the name of the Lord. The things
[56:24] of the world they have dried up our
[56:27] experience with God.
[56:34] Let's go in the comfort.
[56:38] As I see how it laid down here,
[56:44] &gt;&gt; the prophet says,
[56:48] "And if a man
[56:51] will shut himself from God spiritual
[56:53] son,
[56:57] sunship,
[57:00] there is something wrong with his
[57:01] spiritual condition."
[57:05] You see,
[57:07] It is just like getting a plant out
[57:11] and you put it on the inside here.
[57:15] You put it from the sun
[57:18] and you expect it to grow.
[57:23] There is something wrong with it.
[57:27] He continues and says, "For when a man
[57:30] refuses to walk in the leading of a good
[57:33] God,
[57:36] like
[57:38] who is our comfort,
[57:40] our strength and to live in his sunship
[57:45] sunshine
[57:47] is spiritual growth.
[57:53] It is spiritual strength to live in his
[57:55] sunshine,
[57:59] the shining of his glory.
[58:03] You see friends,
[58:05] Living in the sunshine of God,
[58:08] living in the presence of God,
[58:11] it is our spiritual strength.
[58:16] That's what gives us the flourishing of
[58:18] the of the fruit.
[58:21] We continue living in his presence,
[58:25] not standing in unchanging
[58:29] in the sunshine of God.
[58:32] It brings the glory of God around you.
[58:36] Praise the name of the Lord. And that's
[58:39] what brings up the fruit of the spirit.
[58:43] Not only coming in the presence on
[58:45] Sunday,
[58:47] and dwelling in his presence daily,
[58:50] walking in his sunship, in his sunshine
[58:52] daily,
[58:54] praise the name of the Lord. And then he
[58:57] continues and says,
[59:00] he says here and to live in his sunshine
[59:05] is spiritual growth. It is spiritual
[59:07] strength to live in his sunshine,
[59:10] the shining of his glory.
[59:13] It is the greatest privilege
[59:16] that we have to live under the sunlight
[59:19] of God.
[59:22] Look at that good healthy Christian.
[59:26] A Christian that is living in the
[59:28] presence of the Lord.
[59:30] Paragraph 58 says, "I the man or the
[59:34] woman
[59:36] that would put himself down into some
[59:38] cellar
[59:41] and would not see the sunshine,
[59:44] the natural sunshine
[59:47] that God has provided for him.
[59:50] He refuses to believe it and because of
[59:53] selfishness
[59:55] shut himself off,
[59:58] that man will soon become an
[1:00:10] of the Lord. Why? He has hidden away
[1:00:13] from the sunshine.
[1:00:16] He has hidden away from the presence.
[1:00:19] So he becomes anemic. He become fail.
[1:00:24] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:00:27] And then he says he want to have good
[1:00:28] strength
[1:00:30] and have good health
[1:00:32] and he will stone because that he has
[1:00:35] shut himself off from the very privilege
[1:00:38] that God gave him.
[1:00:41] and he did it willfully.
[1:00:44] And then he says, "Then if we shut
[1:00:46] ourselves off from the glory of God,
[1:00:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:00:53] the fellowship of the spirit,
[1:00:55] the first thing that you know,
[1:00:58] we become pale
[1:01:02] Christians.
[1:01:04] Our experiences growing out and
[1:01:10] When the great trials come, we can go
[1:01:14] back.
[1:01:18] We have shut ourselves
[1:01:21] from the right conditions
[1:01:24] of the city.
[1:01:28] He contin
[1:01:35] of God
[1:01:38] It takes that spirit who knows God
[1:01:43] where there is not a wave of doubt.
[1:01:46] I can stand in the midst of the trouble.
[1:01:51] cry out, my redeemer liveth, praise the
[1:01:55] name of the Lord that the soldier
[1:01:59] that we are praying this evening
[1:02:01] and we should be
[1:02:04] that are not shutting themselves away
[1:02:06] from the sunlight of God.
[1:02:09] And then he says down
[1:02:11] we shut ourselves off
[1:02:14] and they do it automatically.
[1:02:17] We do it because that we want to do it.
[1:02:21] But God is good.
[1:02:23] He provides it for us.
[1:02:27] But too many today
[1:02:29] want to get into that healthy place.
[1:02:34] God, a health Christian
[1:02:38] has a healthy spirit.
[1:02:42] Praise the name of the Lord. You see
[1:02:44] friends taking the word
[1:02:48] upon the word.
[1:02:50] the word
[1:02:52] upon the word you see.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; So let's pick up James chapter one
[1:03:00] and then verse one
[1:03:04] just to take an
[1:03:06] testimony
[1:03:09] and we shall stop somewhere there.
[1:03:12] So in the book of James 1 verse 21 he
[1:03:15] says
[1:03:17] wherefore lay apart all filthness and
[1:03:20] spute of noutness and receive with
[1:03:23] meekness the enrafted word which
[1:08:08] He had
[1:08:11] to leave his church.
[1:08:13] He had to leave all the doctrines that
[1:08:14] he had back then
[1:08:17] cross over here
[1:08:20] father son and the holy ghost. when Paul
[1:08:23] left the other side everything there
[1:08:27] I suffered them was a loss
[1:08:30] in the person of Jesus Christ. So when
[1:08:32] you come in here you leave the things of
[1:08:35] the word there and the word that is
[1:08:38] being planted on the inside of you may
[1:08:40] find
[1:08:42] ground
[1:08:44] to grow in the name of the Lord. The
[1:08:47] prophet continues down here and says,
[1:08:50] "Let's pick up in the in the message of
[1:08:51] wisdom
[1:08:54] five,
[1:08:55] how can it happen? How can the true word
[1:08:58] of God grow on this bobbed hair
[1:09:03] wearing cigarette smoking
[1:09:07] away?
[1:09:09] How can it do you
[1:09:12] when such pleasure loving
[1:09:16] seeking crowds as that
[1:09:19] hang out
[1:09:21] such things as that and the love of the
[1:09:24] world? How can the love of God come in?
[1:09:29] How can the seed of grow in such a
[1:09:31] ground?
[1:09:33] It will never it will never take root.
[1:09:36] It will never bring any life to it.
[1:09:39] It will lay there
[1:09:42] old dusted nomination rock.
[1:09:48] It will never bring life.
[1:09:51] Why? You have come and you have come
[1:09:54] with everything of the world.
[1:09:57] You see, he says the word will be there
[1:10:02] on the inside. You can't grow because
[1:10:06] you've come with your bobby hair,
[1:10:09] your cigarette,
[1:10:12] with your fornication.
[1:10:13] You've come with your adultery.
[1:10:16] You come with all of the things of the
[1:10:17] world
[1:10:19] around you there.
[1:10:21] Talking the word.
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:25] And then he says pleasure seekers
[1:10:29] pleasures more than lovers of God. And
[1:10:32] then he says,
[1:10:35] "Why
[1:10:38] the word?"
[1:10:42] He says, "Yet they are smart.
[1:10:45] They are twice as smart as the other
[1:10:48] class."
[1:10:50] Praise the name of the Lord. And then he
[1:10:53] says down in paragraph 382,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; how can a lily live?
[1:10:58] How can a lily live
[1:11:03] and grow
[1:11:05] when it thrives on waters
[1:11:09] grow in one of those? How can it grow in
[1:11:12] one of those dust dominations?
[1:11:15] How can it do it
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; when it thrives on water?
[1:11:20] Water is the spirit. As the prophet is
[1:11:23] telling us, we know the lily grows on
[1:11:27] the water. And when it is growing, it is
[1:11:30] you know it struggles through overcome
[1:11:34] the mud
[1:11:37] to bring it on top of the water.
[1:11:44] That you know dusted denomination is
[1:11:49] to grow
[1:11:51] a condition that does not favor its
[1:11:52] growth
[1:11:55] in the name of the Lord. And then he
[1:11:57] says here that they form they have a
[1:12:01] form of godliness
[1:12:04] the power of the spirit
[1:12:06] but the word falls on them
[1:12:10] they can't grow.
[1:12:12] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:12:14] Hallelujah.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; The word falls on them.
[1:12:18] and it can't grow.
[1:12:21] And then he says
[1:12:26] just like the word was on Eve
[1:12:30] but it couldn't grow. Why? She accepted
[1:12:33] wisdom.
[1:12:35] Satan is wisdom. The word comes to them.
[1:12:39] It falls on them does
[1:12:42] it will fall on them. They hear the word
[1:12:45] preached.
[1:12:47] Do you ever see people sit in the
[1:12:49] church? Did you ever see people sitting
[1:12:51] there?
[1:12:53] They never will make a move.
[1:12:57] To a woman about bobby hair
[1:13:00] after
[1:13:02] pass,
[1:13:06] talk to men about smoking,
[1:13:10] about drinking,
[1:13:12] drink.
[1:13:16] It's like pouring water on a duck's
[1:13:17] back.
[1:13:19] The ant got no place to grow.
[1:13:23] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:13:25] It's that old pleasure seeking
[1:13:27] popularity
[1:13:29] and let the rest of the women do it
[1:13:32] fast.
[1:13:35] I hope you are following this friend. He
[1:13:37] says people come and sit in church
[1:13:40] because of the conditions around them.
[1:13:43] They hear the word and the word does not
[1:13:46] grow on the inside
[1:13:48] because of the situations that they are
[1:13:49] living.
[1:13:51] They are living in anishable condition
[1:13:55] where there is no
[1:13:57] praise the name of the Lord. And then he
[1:13:59] says in paragraph 384
[1:14:02] though the word falls on them
[1:14:05] can't grow his wisdom seeomination
[1:14:11] dust.
[1:14:14] They can't believe in Hebrews 13
[1:14:19] with wisdom
[1:14:21] for it to grow. How come they believe
[1:14:24] Hebrews 13?
[1:14:28] Tell them they say they believe it then
[1:14:32] show me the fruit of it
[1:14:35] of the Lord. He says if they believe it
[1:14:38] let them show it by the fruit.
[1:14:41] So getting back to James 1:29-21
[1:14:44] where James is telling us to put away
[1:14:46] all the filthness
[1:14:49] of the world David says in verse 22
[1:14:53] when you hear the word after making the
[1:14:55] condition is right
[1:15:00] the word
[1:15:03] be the doer of the word
[1:15:05] be doers of the wording
[1:15:10] your
[1:15:11] For if any of the
[1:15:14] do
[1:15:16] a man beholding his natural in a glass
[1:15:20] for he beholdeth himself goeth his way
[1:15:24] and straight away forgetth what man of
[1:15:26] God
[1:15:28] he was he was why
[1:15:32] he's hearing the word
[1:15:35] in the tradition
[1:15:38] in the
[1:15:40] After hearing thus say the Lord here
[1:15:43] he goes out and he has some Pentecostal
[1:15:46] friends.
[1:15:49] Even the other sister is a Christian
[1:15:52] wearing like this
[1:15:57] and then he and then she also takes it
[1:15:58] up that comes to every aspect of life
[1:16:03] in the word with another denomination
[1:16:06] out there.
[1:16:08] the law of liberty
[1:16:11] the word
[1:16:13] and then you go out and don't walk in
[1:16:16] it.
[1:16:19] You are like a man that looks at himself
[1:16:22] in the mirror. This is where his nose is
[1:16:27] out for where his nose is.
[1:16:31] Himself as the seed of Abraham
[1:16:36] is like the seed of
[1:16:39] who he is
[1:16:41] who he is. Praise the name of the Lord
[1:16:44] because the word is the thought of God.
[1:16:47] We come to hear the word. We are coming
[1:16:50] to identify ourselves with the songs of
[1:16:52] God for us today.
[1:16:55] Identify yourself
[1:16:57] of God and you go out and you don't
[1:17:00] remember who you are of God.
[1:17:05] That is forgetting himself.
[1:17:09] Praise the name of the Lord. He says,
[1:17:11] "But those
[1:17:14] who look
[1:17:16] the perfect law of liberty
[1:17:19] there
[1:17:20] being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer
[1:17:24] of the work." This man shall be blessed
[1:17:29] in all his deeds.
[1:17:31] That's the man that is going to grow.
[1:17:35] That is the seed that is going to grow.
[1:17:38] Because when he comes prayerfully
[1:17:42] to hear the word of God,
[1:17:44] he goes out with that wine with that
[1:17:47] word in his heart. When he gets home, he
[1:17:52] takes time to meditate upon the word to
[1:17:56] remind himself of what the thoughts of
[1:17:59] God have spoken
[1:18:02] and then he begin to manifest. the fault
[1:18:05] of God in his life.
[1:18:10] That's why Jesus
[1:18:13] the people that believed on him
[1:18:15] continue in the word
[1:18:18] continuing in the word. No brings growth
[1:18:22] daily.
[1:18:24] Jesus does not desire unbelievers to
[1:18:29] continue his word because there is
[1:18:31] nothing to grow back
[1:18:35] to believe on the word mean there is a
[1:18:37] seed on the inside
[1:18:40] continuing the word continuing in the
[1:18:42] word revelation every day new revelation
[1:18:47] on a higher ground
[1:18:50] growing
[1:18:51] physally
[1:18:53] spiritually
[1:18:55] claiming the promises of God.
[1:19:01] Praise the name of the Lord. Spiritual
[1:19:03] growth can only come when the word of
[1:19:07] God has been sown
[1:19:10] in our heart with fertile bedding ground
[1:19:16] where the seed has a place to put its
[1:19:18] roots.
[1:19:21] And when the seed grows,
[1:19:24] The few are not choked by the by the
[1:19:26] cares and the riches and the pleasures
[1:19:28] of the world.
[1:19:33] Let us put them away. And Paul being a
[1:19:37] witness
[1:19:39] for me to amount to what amounted to you
[1:19:43] can write you letters
[1:19:46] you in the word of God
[1:19:50] some things praise the name of the Lord
[1:19:53] and he says that I continued on
[1:19:57] pressing to the mark of my high calling
[1:20:01] stop just start writing the letters
[1:20:05] The revelation that he had all the
[1:20:07] manner of word that he had
[1:20:11] pressing on
[1:20:16] and feeding on the word walking in the
[1:20:19] word spend three years in
[1:20:25] the revelation of God
[1:20:28] revealed to you.
[1:20:30] Praise the name of the Lord. Thereby he
[1:20:34] grew
[1:20:36] what we read about
[1:20:39] and Paul was a greater person.
[1:20:42] He lived a life of the gospel.
[1:20:46] God bless you. God bless you. Let's
[1:20:49] pray. Father, your word has told us that
[1:20:55] it is until the bed grounds are right,

[1:22:01] number of years. the Lord

[1:22:06] how he
[1:22:08] realized and he sought for your mercy.
[1:22:12] All your mercies were present for him.
[1:22:14] Father, we pray this evening

[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[1:24:02] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus.
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:12] To be like Jesus.
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:19] Oh,
[1:24:21] I long
[1:24:26] to be like him.
[1:24:31] Amen.
[1:24:35] Like John
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:24:40] from
[1:24:55] King. Do you appreciate Brother Martin?
[1:24:59] Amen.
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:02] We appreciate God. Sorry, we started the
[1:25:04] service a little bit late because of
[1:25:05] power and a problem with our generator,
[1:25:08] but we thank God that we've been able to
[1:25:10] catch up. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:25:13] Actually,
[1:25:15] I was just still enjoying praise the
[1:25:17] name of our Lord. You know, it was
[1:25:19] becoming more interesting the way the
[1:25:21] scripture says that the word of God is
[1:25:24] sweeter than honey. Praise the name of
[1:25:26] our Lord. So, it just becoming sweeter
[1:25:28] and sweeter and you know to know about
[1:25:31] our spiritual growth. Just like when
[1:25:34] you're growing up, you know, you always
[1:25:36] try to find out how high have I grown up
[1:25:38] or how big have I grown up. Maybe you
[1:25:41] check the clothes you put on, you find
[1:25:43] maybe they are becoming shorter or
[1:25:46] tighter and then say I'm growing up. Or
[1:25:50] if maybe you can maybe run a longer
[1:25:51] distance, you know, and then for young
[1:25:54] men when they start developing beards,
[1:25:56] they want the beards to be seen that
[1:25:57] they are growing up. When the voice box
[1:26:00] also increase and say, you know, they
[1:26:02] want to talk like men, you know, it
[1:26:04] brings some form of excitement. Even
[1:26:07] young girls when they start putting on,
[1:26:09] you know, some breast coming up and
[1:26:11] different futures changing in their
[1:26:12] bodies, they say, "Yeah, I'm getting
[1:26:15] myself in the form that I need to be."
[1:26:17] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[1:26:19] should be the same thing about the word
[1:26:21] of the Lord is, you know, the more we
[1:26:23] yield ourselves to the Lord is the more
[1:26:25] the life of God keeps on coming in us.
[1:26:28] That should be our desire. When you have
[1:26:30] the spirit of God, you'll always be
[1:26:32] motivated by that spirit of God to read
[1:26:35] the word to really testify about the
[1:26:39] word to really obey the word. And then
[1:26:42] you'll find that your life keeps on
[1:26:44] changing. There are things you took
[1:26:45] interest in, but then you find that you
[1:26:48] don't have even time for those things.
[1:26:50] But things of God are so exciting. You
[1:26:52] know that means that is growth. And you
[1:26:55] know growth brings maturity. Praise the
[1:26:59] name of our Lord. And we are living in
[1:27:01] the time whereby
[1:27:04] every seed that was sown in Genesis has
[1:27:07] to come to maturity at this age. We have
[1:27:10] got the fullness of the word of God, the
[1:27:12] maturity of the word, the full
[1:27:14] restoration. And so even Christ is
[1:27:17] coming for a mature bride. And the
[1:27:20] Bible, brother Brandham teaches us in
[1:27:23] the message
[1:27:25] the statue of a perfect man. He says
[1:27:27] that those people are waiting on us who
[1:27:30] have gone. You can imagine even brother
[1:27:32] Brham where he's lying resting is
[1:27:35] they're waiting on us. The Peter the
[1:27:38] apostles you know just imagine all those
[1:27:41] people from the day of Pentecost who
[1:27:43] have been sleeping on they are waiting
[1:27:45] on us the omega church omega bride of
[1:27:49] Jesus Christ. So we need to really see
[1:27:51] that we grow. If I had some weakness
[1:27:54] yesterday, let me call on the name of
[1:27:56] the Lord and say, "Lord, deliver me from
[1:27:57] this weakness." Praise the name of the
[1:28:00] Lord. If I had some form of failure, if
[1:28:02] I had some kind of thing, you know what
[1:28:04] the Bible says that even that which is
[1:28:07] lame, you know, let it not be taken out
[1:28:10] out of the way, but just aspire, Lord,
[1:28:13] I'm crawling on my knees. Father, give
[1:28:15] me grace to bend. And now when you bend,
[1:28:17] you thank God. If you can stand up, say,
[1:28:19] Lord, I thank you that I'm standing.
[1:28:22] Even if you take one step at a time,
[1:28:24] say, "Lord, I thank you." That is
[1:28:25] growth. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:28:27] That should always be exciting us. You
[1:28:30] know that last week I did something
[1:28:31] wrong. I pray the Lord gives me grace
[1:28:33] not to do it this week. Praise the name
[1:28:35] of our Lord. That is growth. And the
[1:28:38] more we yield to the spirit of God, the
[1:28:41] brother Brandham says that you need to
[1:28:43] put the seed under the sun. If we also
[1:28:46] allow the sunlight of God to really
[1:28:49] continue to shine in our hearts, then
[1:28:51] you'll see ourselves changing our
[1:28:53] attitudes, changing, you know, hatred
[1:28:56] goes away, enimity goes away. So many
[1:28:59] those funny spirits keep on leaving. And
[1:29:01] then you'll see yourself that, hey, I
[1:29:03] used to have this kind of weakness, but
[1:29:05] it's no longer there. I used to do this
[1:29:07] kind of thing. I used to hate people. I
[1:29:09] used not to like people at all. But you
[1:29:11] see, but that has gone. This has gone.
[1:29:13] This has gone. That is growth. Praise
[1:29:16] the name of our Lord. And as long as we
[1:29:18] are still here on earth, we are still
[1:29:20] growing. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:29:22] You know, like when you're still here
[1:29:24] alive, you need to eat. And this is the
[1:29:27] food the Lord has given unto us, the
[1:29:30] food in due season. Praise the name of
[1:29:32] our Lord. So let us be encouraged. Don't
[1:29:36] give up coming to services. Don't give
[1:29:38] up praying. Don't give up reading the
[1:29:40] word. Don't give up in any way. Don't
[1:29:44] just keep on pressing on as the Lord
[1:29:46] gives us more grace. So we appreciate
[1:29:48] brother Martin
[1:29:50] [Applause]
[1:29:51] when he told me yesterday that he wanted
[1:29:53] to travel today because he was
[1:29:56] delivering us 100 1,000 pieces of Bibles
[1:30:00] which were in Mukonos. So I told him if
[1:30:02] you can come and minister today it will
[1:30:04] be good and I thank God has given him
[1:30:06] grace. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:30:08] we appreciate God so much for that.
[1:30:10] We've come to the end of the service.
[1:30:12] Now on Friday, we have an overnight. You
[1:30:15] are likewise welcome. You know, all
[1:30:17] these are feasting points to grow.
[1:30:20] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[1:30:22] wait on the Lord, pray to the Lord, seek
[1:30:24] the face of the Lord. Then on Sunday, we
[1:30:26] shall have two services. The morning
[1:30:28] services for all of us. Then the
[1:30:30] afternoon service will be for the youth
[1:30:33] who are out of school, those who are not
[1:30:36] yet married and even those who are
[1:30:37] married. And I believe it will be more
[1:30:39] of an interactive
[1:30:41] to just see that you know we can get
[1:30:43] over to do the things you know here we
[1:30:46] rarely organize conversions
[1:30:49] you know but because they there are
[1:30:52] other burdens that we have like mostly
[1:30:54] the new believers that's a big burden
[1:30:56] the lord has put upon our heart so
[1:30:57] trying to reach out to those ones there
[1:31:00] we s we can handle that and then as a
[1:31:02] church here we find it is more effective
[1:31:06] if we can be with you in these kind of
[1:31:09] classes. Praise the name of our Lord. At
[1:31:11] least on a monthly basis, then you can
[1:31:13] know that there are things which can be
[1:31:15] helped in your life and then they are
[1:31:17] follow up. You know there is a brother I
[1:31:20] I text a message yesterday and then I
[1:31:24] was asking him
[1:31:26] because okay I was first conscious is he
[1:31:28] on WhatsApp or is not. I found he's on
[1:31:30] WhatsApp. Then I found is he in the
[1:31:33] church group or not? Then after I asked
[1:31:35] him, you know, I sent him a text
[1:31:37] message. Say, "God bless you." Jesse, is
[1:31:39] he active? I found he's active. He said,
[1:31:41] "God bless you. I'm fine." Then I asked
[1:31:43] him another, "Hey brother, do you really
[1:31:46] listen to our daily exaltations in the
[1:31:49] morning?" Now that was yesterday.
[1:31:52] He opened and read it, but up to now he
[1:31:54] has not responded.
[1:31:57] So when I checked his phone, of course
[1:31:59] he was on WhatsApp today, but my
[1:32:01] question has not yet been responded.

[1:32:06] good points of check. Is this one
[1:32:09] feeding or is not feeding? Is this one
[1:32:11] healthy or is not healthy? So some
[1:32:14] extent I also try to reach to one by
[1:32:16] one. So when I get to you of course it
[1:32:18] will be an inbox but this what I feel I
[1:32:21] should really get out. This brother is
[1:32:23] on WhatsApp brother what's happening?

[1:32:29] name of our lord. So you know we need to
[1:32:31] see that we grow together. Praise the
[1:32:33] name of our Lord. So as I said we have
[1:32:37] overnight on Friday. Then on Sunday we
