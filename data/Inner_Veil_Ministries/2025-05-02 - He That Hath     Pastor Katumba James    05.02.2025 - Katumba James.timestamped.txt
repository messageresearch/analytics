[0:06] 10 and then we are reading from verse
[0:09] rather MTH 13 verse
[0:17] 10 so the Bible
[0:20] says and the disciples came and said
[0:23] unto him why speak thou unto them in
[0:27] Parables and he answered and said unto
[0:29] them because it is given unto you to
[0:31] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[0:33] heaven but to them it is not given for
[0:36] soever has to him shall be given and he
[0:39] shall have more abundance but soever has
[0:42] not from him shall be taken or even that
[0:45] he has
[1:19] we may be
[1:21] seated so today I want to preach on the
[1:25] subject he that
[1:30] praise the name of the Lord he
[1:34] that so the Bible
[1:38] says that without
[1:41] Parables Jesus never spoke to the
[1:45] people so he was always speaking to them
[1:48] in
[1:50] Parables and then the disciples came and
[1:53] asking the
[1:56] Lord Master why are speaking to them in
[1:59] parables
[2:01] and then he
[2:08] answer therefore speak I to them in
[2:11] Parables because
[2:13] seeing seeing they see not and hearing
[2:18] hear not neither do they understand
[2:30] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[2:32] Isaiah which said by hearing you shall
[2:35] hear and you shall not understand and
[2:37] seeing you shall see and shall
[2:47] [Music]
[2:54] not for these people's hearts is waxed
[2:57] gross and their ears are D of he Ing and
[3:00] their eyes they have closed lest at any
[3:04] time they should see with their eyes and
[3:06] hear with their ears and should
[3:09] understand with their heart and should
[3:11] be converted and I should heal them
[3:35] praise the name of our Lord so now the
[3:37] Lord Jesus gave them the
[3:42] reason these
[3:45] people you know I speak to them in
[3:48] Parables that when they
[3:51] hear they have heard the word but they
[3:55] don't have the understanding of the word
[4:00] they have
[4:01] seen but they cannot
[4:05] perceive so now we see here that it is
[4:08] very important for
[4:10] us that whenever we come to the services
[4:14] of the
[4:15] Lord whenever we come to
[4:18] church we need to pray that God gives us
[4:24] understanding Lord give me understanding
[4:26] in this
[4:28] service that I may know the move of the
[4:32] Holy
[4:34] Spirit I may know the purpose of God
[4:37] speaking to us this
[4:39] [Music]
[4:41] message why has God chosen to speak to
[4:44] us this
[4:46] way praise the name of the Lord that we
[4:49] may not be in a
[4:51] sttion that you know our eyes can see
[4:54] but we don't
[4:57] understand our ears here but we can't
[5:00] understand and how to do
[5:03] everything so if we can't
[5:07] understand then it means that the sound
[5:10] that we are
[5:12] receiving is uncertain
[5:17] sound in other words you can never
[5:19] prepare
[5:21] yourself you know you don't know what
[5:24] the noise comes is
[5:27] meaning like in the Old Testament
[5:31] when they would blow a
[5:33] trumpet it had different kind of
[5:39] significances there is a way they would
[5:41] blow a
[5:44] trumpet in one way it would tell them
[5:47] that you come for the
[5:51] feast and then in another way it would
[5:53] tell them there is a war going on
[5:59] people had to
[6:02] understand you know the voice of the
[6:06] trumpet and what it
[6:11] signifies praise the name of our Lord
[6:14] what does the trumpet
[6:16] signify so that even as when we come to
[6:19] the services of the
[6:21] lord we need to seek the Lord and say
[6:24] Lord speak to
[6:28] me speak to me way I can understand
[6:32] you that I can make
[6:35] preparation based on what you desire me
[6:38] to
[6:40] do praise the name of the Lord so now
[6:43] when we go back to MTH
[6:46] 13 and then verse
[6:49] 11 he says he answered and said unto
[6:54] them because it is given unto you to
[6:57] know
[7:00] praise the name of the Lord so the Bible
[7:03] says it is given to us to
[7:08] know and then when you continue reading
[7:11] that
[7:13] scripture the mysteries of the kingdom
[7:15] of
[7:18] heaven but unto them it is not
[7:23] given and then we see that we are living
[7:25] in an
[7:27] age where all the Myster my of the
[7:32] book have to be
[7:35] revealed and the mysteries of the book
[7:37] have all been
[7:40] revealed in Revelations
[7:45] 10 now what the devil does is to
[7:49] discredit the
[7:52] message you know and then say it is
[8:00] so
[8:01] that people don't pay attention to what
[8:04] is
[8:07] spoken you know that's what the devil
[8:10] does he makes sure that he he puts it
[8:15] down he makes sure that it means
[8:20] it he makes sure that it is of no
[8:22] relevance to
[8:25] you you may not give your ear
[8:30] it's the same
[8:32] spirit that was there even in the times
[8:34] of
[8:36] Jeremiah let us go to Jeremiah
[8:42] 18: amen amen Jeremiah 18 and then Verse
[8:49] 18 the Bible
[8:57] says then said they come come and let us
[9:01] devise devices against Jeremiah for the
[9:04] law shall not perish from the priest nor
[9:07] a counsel from the wise nor the word
[9:10] from the Prophet come and let us Smite
[9:13] him with the tongue and let us not give
[9:16] heed to any of his words
[9:44] that's always what the devil
[9:47] does that you may not give he to what is
[9:52] spoken you know like discrediting the
[9:55] message
[10:00] [Music]
[10:01] discrediting the
[10:03] minister so that you don't have
[10:08] confidence you know to what is being
[10:12] spoken that's how the devil
[10:15] does he says let us go and smite his
[10:20] mouth and then us talk bad about
[10:24] him let us make sure that we put
[10:27] something bad about that person
[10:32] nobody would want to hear
[10:36] him nobody wants to go to those
[10:40] meetings nobody wants to go to that
[10:48] church that's what theil
[10:50] does and so now he keeps people
[10:54] away from hearing the truth
[10:59] the name of our Lord like now we we used
[11:02] to have this message books with an
[11:10] eego and so now what those people are
[11:14] saying when you see a book
[11:19] with it don't read it at
[11:23] all what are they doing they smiting
[11:27] with the tongue
[11:30] so that somebody who would be
[11:34] helped they have rejected what can help
[11:39] them praise the name of our Lord so let
[11:42] us go back to MTH 13 verse
[11:47] 11 he answered and said unto them
[11:50] because it is given unto you to know the
[11:52] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[11:55] them it is not given
[12:09] verse 12 for soever ha to him shall be
[12:12] given and he shall have more abundance
[12:15] but soever has not from him shall be
[12:18] taken away even that he
[12:24] [Music]
[12:32] praise the name of our Lord so now you
[12:35] see it says Whoever
[12:39] has now we want to see what is that you
[12:45] have and then he said when you
[12:49] have you shall be
[12:54] given and when you are
[12:56] given you shall love more about
[13:00] AB praise the name of Lord
[13:05] whoever now you can't
[13:08] have if you are not
[13:11] given praise the name of the Lord so
[13:14] then there had to be a
[13:17] giving in order for you to
[13:20] receive praise the name of the Lord the
[13:23] Bible says it is given to you to know
[13:27] the Mysteries
[13:33] now when it is given to us to know the
[13:39] Mysteries then we have
[13:42] access you know we have the
[13:46] Liberty we have a
[13:49] link to know more of
[13:55] God we have the access
[13:59] to receive more of God in
[14:03] us praise the name of the Lord just like
[14:07] the
[14:07] river once the river
[14:10] flows it doesn't stop
[14:13] flowing so it keeps on
[14:15] flowing keeps on flowing and that should
[14:19] also be our
[14:22] relationship should always be continuous
[14:25] before God
[14:29] the name of our Lord so the Bible says
[14:31] he that
[14:33] has so what do we
[14:36] have praise the name of our
[14:38] Lord now in the
[14:41] message brother let us go to MTH
[14:47] 11 and then verse 25
[14:53] verse
[14:54] say at that time Jesus answered and said
[14:58] I thank thee of father Lord of Heaven
[15:01] and Earth because thou Hast healed these
[15:03] things from the wise and prudent and has
[15:06] revealed themto the babies
[15:29] even so father for it seemed good in thy
[15:39] sight all things are delivered unto me
[15:41] of my father and no man knoweth the son
[15:44] but the father neither knoweth any man
[15:47] the father save the son and he to whom
[15:50] soever the son will reveal him
[16:10] so he says nobody knows the
[16:15] father except the son and nobody knows
[16:19] the
[16:20] son except the father and he to whom the
[16:24] son will
[16:27] reveal so to to whom does he reveal
[16:31] himself praise the name of our Lord now
[16:34] in the message the Ephesian Church
[16:38] AG he says he that has an
[16:43] ear let him hear what the spirit says
[16:46] unto the
[16:48] churches then he says it may be that
[16:51] Millions will hear this words or read
[16:53] them
[17:04] but how will to
[17:10] them that we don't
[17:13] know but he who will lend his
[17:19] ear and want to know the words of the
[17:24] truth will find the spirit of
[17:27] God en lightening
[17:31] him if your ear is open to the
[17:36] word the spirit of God will make the
[17:39] word real to
[17:44] you now that is a work of the
[17:48] spirit I can teach you the
[17:51] truth but if you don't have an open ear
[17:55] to hear it
[17:58] and your heart receive
[18:01] it you won't get
[18:05] Revelation praise the name of our Lord
[18:07] so we must have a willing
[18:11] heart desire to
[18:13] learn praise the name of the Lord desire
[18:16] to know more of
[18:20] God and we can see that in the
[18:24] scriptures when we go to the book of
[18:27] Acts
[18:29] and then we read in Chapter
[18:33] 13 praise the name of our Lord
[18:38] 1 and then verse
[18:43] 44 and the next Sabbath day came almost
[18:46] the whole city together to hear the word
[18:48] of
[18:57] God but when the saw the multitudes they
[19:00] were filled with envy and spoke against
[19:03] those things which were spoken by Paul
[19:07] contradicting and
[19:20] baming then Paul and Barabas waed bold
[19:23] and say it was necessary that the word
[19:26] of God should first have been spoken to
[19:28] to you but seeing you put it from you
[19:31] and judge yourselves
[19:34] Unworthy of everlasting life La we turn
[19:38] to the Gentiles
[20:01] now the Jews rejected the word of
[20:05] God and then they Gentiles received the
[20:08] word of
[20:10] God and now as many as Gentiles received
[20:13] the word of
[20:16] God then they were delivered by the word
[20:19] of
[20:20] God as many as received the word of
[20:25] God they received eternal life
[20:29] but then those ones who rejected the
[20:31] word of
[20:33] God they counted themselves
[20:38] unworthy it's just like the
[20:41] invitation come to the wedding
[20:44] supper the Bible says each of them had
[20:50] excuses and then the scripture
[20:53] says they counted themselves unworthy
[20:59] now it's the people who count themselves
[21:01] as
[21:04] unworthy and then they reject the
[21:07] truth they reject the word of God but
[21:10] now when the Gentiles heard the word of
[21:16] God the Bible says they were
[21:20] glad and glorify the word of the
[21:26] Lord they glorified the word of the
[21:30] Lord and as many as we ordained to
[21:33] eternal
[21:36] life
[21:38] believed and the word of the Lord was
[21:40] published throughout all the
[21:47] region praise the name of so when we
[21:50] have been given opportunity to
[21:55] hear desire to hear more of God
[21:59] desire to receive more of
[22:02] God praise the name of our Lord the more
[22:05] you
[22:06] hear is the more you receive
[22:10] God the more delivers you from your
[22:14] weaknesses is the more the Lord changes
[22:17] your
[22:19] mind is the more God works in your
[22:24] life praise the name of our Lord just
[22:27] the more you receive from
[22:33] the more youire from
[22:35] God praise the name of the Lord so now
[22:38] the Bible is telling us that as many as
[22:42] we are ordained to eternal
[22:46] life they believed so now if we are
[22:50] ordained to eternal
[22:54] life then it is us
[22:58] who
[23:01] have because the Bible says he that
[23:06] has what do you have you have been
[23:10] ordained to eternal
[23:14] life before the foundation of the
[23:17] world your name was put in the Lamb's
[23:20] Book of
[23:22] Life before the world was
[23:25] there God already predestinated
[23:31] so now when you come here on
[23:33] Earth you already
[23:36] have praise the name of our Lord you
[23:39] already been ordained to eternal
[23:44] life you have already your name has
[23:46] already been written in
[23:50] heaven so now in the process of
[23:54] time you just come to your realization
[23:59] that my name is written in
[24:01] heaven and the name is not written in
[24:05] heaven the time the day you
[24:08] believe the name is not written in
[24:11] heaven the day you were
[24:13] born the name was written in
[24:16] heaven before the foundation of the
[24:20] world so then you
[24:23] have and so the Bible is addressing the
[24:26] people
[24:29] he
[24:31] that who are those who were known by God
[24:35] before the foundation of the
[24:40] world praise the name of our Lord let us
[24:43] go back to
[24:48] Matthew okay we can I think pick up from
[24:51] Luke chapter 10 verse 20
[24:58] CH 10:
[25:03] 20 not withstanding in this Rejoice not
[25:07] that the spirits are subject unto you
[25:09] but rather Rejoice because your names
[25:12] are written in
[25:22] heaven praise the name of the Lord it
[25:24] says
[25:26] Rejoice because your name is written in
[25:31] heaven so you don't Rejoice because you
[25:33] can cast out
[25:35] demons you don't Rejoice because you can
[25:39] prophesy you don't Rejoice because you
[25:42] can do
[25:44] Miracles but you rejoice because your
[25:47] name is written in
[25:50] heaven and because your name is written
[25:53] in
[25:55] heaven then God has given you the
[26:01] ability to hear from
[26:04] him praise the name of Lord God has
[26:08] given you the
[26:09] ability to be able to hear from
[26:13] him because your name is written in
[26:17] heaven you look at the scenario of
[26:21] Paul praise the name of our Lord Paul
[26:24] was moving from Jerusalem
[26:28] and then he was going to
[26:31] Damascus and then he was having people
[26:33] with
[26:34] him coming from the temple in
[26:39] Jerusalem praise the name of the Lord
[26:42] now in Acts
[26:49] 26:3 he
[26:51] says at midday oh King I saw in the way
[26:54] a light from heaven above the brightness
[26:57] of the Sun shining round about me and
[27:01] them which Jour with
[27:23] me and when we were have all Fallen to
[27:26] the earth I had a voice speaking unto me
[27:30] and saying in the Hebrew Tong soul soul
[27:35] why me it is hard for to kick against
[27:38] the
[27:54] PRI now you see Paul is moving with a
[27:57] group of people
[28:00] soldiers of the
[28:02] temple to go and arrest
[28:05] people who are worshiping Jesus Christ
[28:09] and then a light
[28:12] appears and then they all fall to the
[28:16] ground but it is only
[28:20] Paul who had the
[28:23] voice and whose name was mentioned
[28:30] praise the name of our Lord PA had his
[28:32] name
[28:34] called Christ revealed himself
[28:41] to but then to the other people were
[28:43] moving with
[28:45] Paul they never understood what was
[28:48] taking
[28:49] place the only thing they would go back
[28:51] to
[28:54] Jerusalem and then maybe give a report
[28:59] the other man we went we went we were
[29:01] moving
[29:02] with there that came from
[29:06] heaven we met a light from
[29:09] heaven and we all fell to the ground and
[29:13] we just had a
[29:15] sound but we didn't know what it
[29:18] is we just had kind of
[29:22] noise and we didn't know what exactly it
[29:25] is so for them they went back to do
[29:27] their
[29:29] work but it's only
[29:32] sa who got the true revelation of Jesus
[29:36] Christ and now when his eyes were blind
[29:39] because of the glory of the
[29:46] light you know he was blind for three
[29:48] days and
[29:50] night he never or Dr
[29:53] anything so he was in praying and
[29:56] fasting
[29:58] because he said who are you
[30:01] Lord I'm Jesus so he took Time Lord
[30:05] forgive me confessing his sins Lord I
[30:08] didn't know you are the
[30:12] one when was waiting on the
[30:16] Lord then God showed him a
[30:19] vision anas coming and laying his on
[30:24] him and him receiving the sight
[30:30] now Saul he never went back to the high
[30:34] [Music]
[30:35] priests he never went back to his
[30:38] religion he never went back to his
[30:42] denomination he had found the true path
[30:44] of
[30:46] Christ so Paul
[30:50] heard praise the name of the Lord
[30:54] that Paul
[30:58] praise the name of our Lord and because
[31:00] his name was written in
[31:03] heaven he had the
[31:05] ability to hear the voice of
[31:08] God calling him out of the
[31:12] confusion praise the name of our Lord
[31:15] and they can also give the same
[31:17] testimony we can also give the same
[31:21] testimony that because our names are
[31:23] written in
[31:25] heaven that's why we've had the voice of
[31:28] this
[31:30] message come out of her my
[31:33] people and be not partakers of her
[31:37] sins we heard praise the name of our
[31:40] Lord because our names were written in
[31:44] heaven so we had the
[31:50] ability to hear the voice of
[31:52] God praise the name of like the mother
[31:56] eag
[31:57] is the name of Lord Brother gives that
[32:00] story of of an eag which lay an
[32:11] egg and now when it laid
[32:16] somewhere then the hand also laid eggs
[32:19] and then that egg was put together with
[32:21] those of the
[32:26] hand handed
[32:30] and then now this small
[32:33] eag was among the
[32:37] cheeks denominational kind of you know
[32:42] Believers and so now the mother would
[32:44] teach this
[32:52] scratch and so this e would try but it
[32:55] was hard
[32:59] you know being kind of trying to
[33:01] accustomed in the religious
[33:08] systems baptism in the name of the
[33:10] Father the Son and the Holy
[33:13] Ghost baptism of little
[33:16] children that's in
[33:19] the praise the name of the Lord women
[33:22] preachers that is in
[33:26] the women putting men's
[33:30] clothes that is in
[33:32] the you know women bleaching themselves
[33:35] and all kind of
[33:39] things in the and theet was held up in
[33:43] that kind
[33:46] ofation but one day the mother e was
[33:50] flying over that
[33:53] place and then started
[33:56] screaming and then small
[33:59] ego had a voice which is identical to
[34:03] it and then it flew
[34:06] away praise the name of the Lord he
[34:10] that to him shall be given
[34:13] more praise the name of the Lord now in
[34:17] the
[34:19] message the revelation of Jesus
[34:22] Christ he says
[34:28] it's going to take the operation of the
[34:31] Holy
[34:34] Ghost that this means this book can't be
[34:37] revealed to
[34:43] anyone but a special class of
[34:47] people it will take one with a prophetic
[34:53] Insight it will require the ability to
[34:56] hear from
[35:01] God so God gives us that
[35:05] ability to hear from
[35:08] him a special class of
[35:11] people who are those special classes of
[35:15] people whose names were written in
[35:19] heaven like we read in the book of Acts
[35:21] chapter
[35:24] 13 the Jews were contradicting and
[35:27] baming after the preaching of the
[35:31] word and they rejected it but now when
[35:35] Gentiles
[35:37] heart they received it with all their
[35:42] heart praise the name of now in theim
[35:45] church
[35:48] age he
[35:54] says he that has here let him here
[36:02] singular he what the spirit says to the
[36:08] churches notice here that
[36:12] Jesus by the
[36:15] spirit in every
[36:18] age addresses himself to only one
[36:23] person relative to the word of that age
[36:31] only one
[36:33] messenger for each
[36:36] age receives what the spirit has to say
[36:40] to that
[36:44] age and that one
[36:47] messenger is the messenger to the true
[36:52] church he speaks for God
[36:59] by the Revelation to the
[37:03] churches both true and
[37:08] false the message is then broadcast to
[37:16] all but though it is broadcast for all
[37:19] who come within the range of the
[37:22] message though it is broadcast to all
[37:29] who come to the the range of the
[37:35] message that
[37:38] message is received
[37:46] individually by only a certain qualified
[37:49] group in a certain
[37:53] way it's received individually
[37:56] [Music]
[37:59] by a certain cified
[38:12] group each
[38:15] individual of that
[38:18] group is the one who has the
[38:22] ability to
[38:24] hear what the spirit is saying
[38:29] by the of the
[38:31] messenger praise the name of Lord so
[38:34] there's a special class of
[38:37] people there is a special people God
[38:42] hased praise the name of the Lord all
[38:45] the
[38:47] Earth there are people God has
[38:51] selected praise the name of our Lord who
[38:54] has ordained to eternal life
[38:59] and their names are written in
[39:03] heaven their names are written in the
[39:05] lambus Book of
[39:09] Life they are the people who have the
[39:13] ability to hear what the spirit is
[39:17] saying praise the name of our Lord and
[39:20] so
[39:22] godain that is only those people
[39:27] who will receive the word of
[39:30] God praise the name of the Lord those
[39:33] are the
[39:35] people who
[39:37] have praise the name of the Lord the
[39:40] Bible says he that
[39:45] has praise the name of our Lord my name
[39:48] is written in the Lamb's Book of
[39:51] Life so it doesn't matter what the devil
[39:55] may try to mess around with you
[40:00] if your name is written in
[40:02] heaven praise the name of the Lord you
[40:05] will
[40:06] hear praise the name of our Lord and you
[40:09] will be
[40:10] quickened praise the name of our Lord
[40:13] you hear and you'll be
[40:16] quickened the same thing with
[40:20] Daniel Daniel had men
[40:23] somewhere and then an earthquake
[40:26] came and men took
[40:28] off for them they stopped at the
[40:32] earthquake but Daniel had the
[40:35] voice so even when we come into the
[40:37] services of the Lord like
[40:41] now are you
[40:43] hearing praise the name of or maybe you
[40:47] got I don't even what they were talking
[40:51] about I don't know what this thing was
[40:55] meaning we need to the ability to
[41:00] hear praise the name of our Lord and
[41:02] until we have the ability to
[41:11] hear that's how we can be
[41:16] converted that's how praise the name of
[41:19] the Lord you can
[41:22] understand and then
[41:25] know this is mine
[41:28] praise the name of the Lord you know
[41:30] it's just like when
[41:32] God you know when Moses was weing on the
[41:37] herob
[41:41] mountain and then he saw the fire and
[41:44] then he said let me look at the
[41:46] fire the fire attracted his
[41:54] attention and then when he went
[41:57] then the voice said this is a Holy
[42:00] Ground remove your shoes and now when
[42:04] God saw that his attention was
[42:08] attracted he called him by
[42:11] name Moses Moses Moses m praise the name
[42:17] of our Lord and that's what the Gospel
[42:19] of Jesus Christ does to
[42:22] us it calls us by
[42:25] name praise the name of Lord so when you
[42:28] hear your
[42:30] name in other words it has been revealed
[42:34] to
[42:35] you that your name is written in
[42:39] heaven praise the name of our Lord then
[42:42] it quickens
[42:44] you it brings your
[42:49] conversion you know where you are
[42:52] converted praise the name of our Lord so
[42:55] there is no way outside of the
[42:59] word for you to know your name is
[43:04] written if it doesn't come by
[43:08] Revelation praise the name of the Lord
[43:11] now in the message the P Church
[43:15] age did you get that last
[43:19] thought I repeat every Church age ends
[43:22] with the same admonition
[43:31] he that
[43:35] an an individual hear what the spirit
[43:38] says to the
[43:40] church the spirit gives the
[43:44] word he that has the truth for each
[43:52] age each H has had its own El
[44:02] and that elect
[44:05] group already heard the
[44:10] word and received
[44:12] it
[44:14] proving that they had the seed in
[44:18] them praise the name of the
[44:20] Lord every
[44:24] El in their age
[44:27] they had the word which the spirit was
[44:32] saying and then they received that
[44:36] word they received the word as their
[44:41] portion praise the name of our and we
[44:44] have also received the word of God as
[44:47] our
[44:50] portion and the word we have
[44:53] received you know let us allow that word
[44:56] to trans transform
[44:59] us to change our
[45:02] thinking to change our
[45:04] speech to change our
[45:07] character so that the word of God May
[45:10] mold
[45:12] us into the image of Jesus
[45:16] Christ because he's coming for a church
[45:18] without spot or
[45:20] wrinkle so the word that we
[45:24] receive washes us sanctifies us and
[45:29] makes us to be into the image of
[45:32] Christ it takes away all your
[45:35] blemishes it takes away all you know
[45:38] your kind of
[45:42] spots and then it takes away anything
[45:45] that is contrary to
[45:48] God praise the name of our and then in
[45:51] John 8 ver
[45:55] 47 and he he that is of god Heth God's
[46:00] word
[46:04] read you therefore hear them
[46:08] not because you are not of
[46:13] God they refuse the word
[46:18] Jesus and his words for their
[46:22] days but the TR seat
[46:27] received the
[46:29] word because they were of
[46:33] God praise the name of so when you
[46:37] receive the
[46:38] word it
[46:41] means you are of
[46:43] God it
[46:45] means you
[46:47] have he
[46:50] that praise the name of our all thy
[46:55] children shall be told of
[46:58] God Holy Spirit that's Isaiah
[47:04] 54:3 Jesus said the same thing in John
[47:11] 6:4 being one with the
[47:14] word proves whether you are of God and
[47:17] spirit
[47:21] fill no other
[47:24] Criterion praise the name of our Lord
[47:27] so if you have the
[47:29] word and you are one with the
[47:33] word you are of
[47:36] God and you spirit
[47:38] filled there's no other way to prove
[47:42] that
[47:44] the now the
[47:49] message he says now here we are coming
[47:53] to a conclusion
[47:57] as the Eternal logos
[48:02] God was manifest in the
[48:06] Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness
[48:10] of the
[48:13] godhead and the Eternal one was the
[48:16] father manifest in
[48:20] flesh and thereby gained the title of
[48:23] son
[48:28] even so
[48:29] we Eternal in his
[48:34] thoughts in our turn became the many
[48:38] membered spoken word
[48:45] seed manif in the
[48:49] flesh those Eternal
[48:53] thoughts now manifest in the flesh
[48:59] are the sons of
[49:01] God even as we are so
[49:05] called we did not become the
[49:09] seit by the
[49:15] rebirth we were
[49:18] SE
[49:20] and we are
[49:23] reborn for only the elect
[49:28] can be
[49:29] reborn praise the name of the Lord say
[49:32] the
[49:43] new praise the name of the Lorden it is
[49:46] only the
[49:48] elect it's only the
[49:54] Elise the name of Lord only the
[49:58] elect that can be born
[50:02] again if one is not an
[50:07] elect can never be born
[50:12] again it's only those whose names were
[50:15] written in the numbers Book of
[50:20] Life are the only
[50:23] people who can be born again
[50:28] they come from God and then they go back
[50:32] to
[50:32] God but then they are putting the
[50:34] manifestation of this flesh during this
[50:41] time praise the name of our so the new
[50:45] birth does not make any person the seed
[50:48] of
[50:50] God it's only those who we seed in God
[51:04] and the only people can be born
[51:08] again those are the people who
[51:12] have he that
[51:15] has what do you have my name is written
[51:18] in the Lamb's Book of
[51:21] Life what do you have have been ordained
[51:24] to eternal life
[51:27] what do you have I come from God and I
[51:31] go back to God what do you have praise
[51:34] the name of our Lord I come from
[51:38] God so I
[51:40] have now because I come from
[51:44] God then I have the
[51:47] ability that seed inside of
[51:51] me quickens
[51:54] me when the word of God comes
[51:57] me so when the word
[52:00] comes you receive the
[52:03] word praise the name of our Lord like
[52:06] the woman at
[52:08] the she was living in
[52:12] prostitution she was a
[52:14] Samar said you tell us to go to
[52:16] Jerusalem
[52:22] toship and for us she was just in that
[52:25] kind of mess
[52:29] but now when the word came to
[52:32] her and then revealed her nature of
[52:38] life she said when the Messiah
[52:43] come he will tell us these
[52:46] things she was a
[52:48] seed praise the name of the Lord seed
[52:51] buried in the concrete of prosecution
[52:56] but as long as the light goes to that
[53:00] seed praise the name of Lord like when
[53:03] you get a
[53:04] seed and then put it on
[53:08] concrete allow a small of light to go
[53:11] where the seed
[53:14] is you'll see the the plant coming down
[53:17] below the
[53:19] concrete coming
[53:22] up when you hear your
[53:24] name praise the name of
[53:27] when you hear the word of
[53:29] God calling your
[53:31] name it doesn't matter the condition you
[53:34] are
[53:35] in you just respond Here I Am
[53:39] Lord that woman responded to the
[53:42] call she left her Port there and then
[53:46] she ran to the city and then she said
[53:49] come and see the man who has told me
[53:52] everything about my
[53:55] life praise the name
[53:58] he
[53:59] that praise the name of our Lord God
[54:02] ordained us to eternal
[54:04] life so he has given us the
[54:07] ability to hear the
[54:10] word praise the name of our Lord now let
[54:13] us go back as I try to
[54:20] finish and then verse
[54:24] 11 he answered and said unto them
[54:27] because it is given unto you to know the
[54:29] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[54:32] to them it's not
[54:42] [Music]
[54:45] given says it is given to
[54:49] us praise the name of our Lord then he
[54:52] says forever has
[54:56] shall be
[54:59] given so we
[55:02] have our names written in the Lamb's
[55:04] Book of
[55:06] Life so we are
[55:09] given the ability to hear the
[55:13] word and because we have the ability to
[55:15] hear the
[55:18] word then it is revealed to
[55:22] us and when it is revealed to us then we
[55:26] can be born
[55:28] again and when you are born
[55:31] again you become a living
[55:35] Fountain praise the name of the Lord and
[55:38] the
[55:39] fountain it keeps on
[55:41] flowing flowing flowing so he says you
