she say she want to be a doctor so whenever we go to preach I invite my doctor J to come and sing for us you know last year I was in Canada and there was a a brother whose parent are doctors and I didn't know the course he was studying in the University but I began to call him Dr Kai and I keep calling him so he sent me a testimony said you have been calling me a doctor now I have been aced in a medical school in Australia I said I I see that in you so even though you have not grabbed it already faith is a substance of things hopeful hallelujah hallelujah the day I heard a story he went to the hospital with the mother little I'm talking about and the nurses and the doctors were not allowing her to enter the world because he's a child she told the mother don't they know I'm going to be a doctor one day I said why did they prevent The Future Doctor to enter the hospital that is Faith whatever you want to be in future whatever your ambition is Proclaim it and it will come to pass when I was young when I was a child I told my siblings I am going to be an ambassador so politically I went to University to study political science and the Ambassador I was thinking is to represent my country in another foreign country but God also have a different ambassador it is not a political government Ambassador but in God's book he's an ambassador he's a missionary to another country and by his grace I have traveled to over 23 countries preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ across Africa across the Caribbean islands America I am still a young man but it is what God put in me and what I confess and that is what is happening amen and amen I want to thank Pastor for giving me the opportunity to come and be a blessing to you I want to appreciate Pastor James also for his love and I want to thank my dear friend pastor jeremia for hosting me it has been a blessing I want to thank sister Deb also we had a wonderful Crusade last week it was a real blessing and we really have a good time in the presence of the Lord all the musicians that came from this place to help us the Lord bless you we are grateful unto the Lord the pastor told me to take my time so why I'm taking my time don't be hurry this is the last Sunday of the year you can even spend the whole day when you go to Israel in the Sabbath day they spend the whole day from the sunset of Friday to the sunset of Saturday they in the temple praising the Lord so don't be in hurry I want to fail at home I chose my friend to interpret me because he has interpreted me in many places when I talk naturally sometimes he doesn't hear me when I'm preaching under anointing interpret accordingly now you wonder is this this person was not hearing you when you were talking and I'm a little bit fast preacher so sometimes I tell the interpreters before they come amen and amen and sometimes by the grace of God even in a strange Country When The Interpreter make a mistake the Holy Ghost tells me and I stopped them and I say it in their language I was it happened in Mal and I was telling that testimony in Kenya and after telling that testimony we're preaching was saying something else so the Lord helped me to stop him so I said it in the language that is how sometimes God confirm his word so the world is in a Christmas season that is the world and there is nothing we can do about it brother Abraham says Christmas have come to stay we don't believe in Christmas we don't celebrate Christmas but we take opportunity of the holiday amen and amen don't be too holy when the sister send you Merry Christmas iuke you no no no no the days of the week Monday Tuesday Wednesday those names were given by the Roman Catholics the months of the year the month every month January February it was still given by the catalst that is a Roman Calendar and we are using it today don't be too holy oh brother Happy New Year I rebuke you we don't celebrate Christmas no hallelujah hallelujah it's true we don't celebrate Christmas to the believer every day is a Christmas Christmas if you understand the real meaning of Christmas you know it is not a particular Day in the year is every day every day is my Christmas Merry Christmas Merry Christmas you shake your brother shake your sister Merry Christmas hallelujah hallelujah don't be a legalist and don't be a fanatic hallelujah hallelujah when I said don't be a legalist don't wait for only 25th December before you travel to visit your parents in the village don't wait for Christmas before you buy your wife a gift I think the sisters will say amen and the sisters also but Abraham wife gave him a Christmas gift also you can buy a gift for your husband hallelujah hallelujah but don't wait for a particular Day in the year to help somebody to love somebody or to do good for somebody every day is a Christmas just like the Sabbath the Sabbath is not on Saturday to the Gentiles to the believer every day is a Sabbath because we don't have a day but we have an internal Sabbath the Holy Ghost giving us rest in our Souls praise be the name of the Lord I bring greetings from the family back home as we prepare to stand on our feet the Church of God back home also sends their greetings do you receive them we thank the lord we have two Services yesterday we went to uh let me check the name so that I don't make mistake we went to a place in the in the morning that [Music] is me then we went to in the afternoon we thank God for the great work he is doing and he will continue to do amen and amen amen amen we want to read from Matthew chapter 2 but read first from Luke 2 I don't know why somehow God made those scriptures or those stories fall in these two scriptures read from Luke 2 verse one then we read again from Matthew Chapter 2 it looks as if they are two different context but he give us the same inspiration I am now bringing my Christmas message I hope I am not out of order Luke Chapter 2 ver praise the Lord Luke 2 verse says and it came to pass in those days that there went a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when serenus was governor of Syria and all went to be tax everyone to his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea onto the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of to be taxed with Mary his wife being great with child verse six and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she be delivered and she brought forth her first son and wrapped him in swling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the in and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord sh ran about them and they were so afraid and the said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the bab WRA in swling clothes laying in the manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of of heavenly host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will towards men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to the other let us now go onto Bethlehem and see these things which is come to pass which the Lord had made [Music] known blessed be the name of the Lord and they came with h and found Mary and Joseph and a babe laying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the same which was told them concerning this child and all they that had it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and in how many of you are going to be married this morning and the Shepherds turn glorifying and praising God for all the things that they have heard and seen as it was told unto them our shall we pray again Heavenly Father we want to be married this morning over all these things that you are revealing unto us word be established in our souls let it do us good may he never sleep from our hands we be doers of the word but not the hearers of the word come Lord and anoint that word into our hearts amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord shall we humbly be seated so my title this morning is why it to be Shepherd and Bethlehem the prophet of God preached a message why it had to be Shepherds and now he preached another message why little bethle and these are all Christmas messages now we put them together why it had to be Shepherds and Bethlehem hallelujah hallelujah so that is my Christmas message for you hallelujah hallelujah and we will take our time I know you are good listeners when you are being trained under a great teacher you have a quality of a great gift to listenting amen and amen and I know the things that we preach this morning is some things you have heard them before but it's all good the prophet said a true Revelation to a True Believer can never be overemphasized no matter how many times you hear it it always become new new to you hallelujah hallelujah so maybe you have heard it before but open your heart God have something for you maybe you have also heard anything about it before do not worry the Holy Ghost will water the word into your heart amen and amen so our sin begins this morning in a place hallelujah hallelujah where the king made a decree that everybody should go to their City to be taxed just as many people are living in ginger here some are coming from Cala different places that maybe because of job or one or you find yourself here and the pressure came the decree went forth now everybody should go to your home state to be tax and the time of the decree came it was a time that Mary was Heavy with a child you might say this is a wicked King can't you see my baby is heavy my wife is heavy to and you must travel far to Bethlehem hallelujah hallelujah but the scripture says all things were together for good to them that love the Lord to them who are called according to his purpose it may look is going wrong for you but all things give thanks to the Lord hallelujah he knows what is best for you Joseph did not understand it even Mary couldn't understand it but they were traveling hallelujah hallelujah to go to Bethlehem hallelujah hallelujah so he went from Galilee after the city of Nazareth into Juda onto the city of David which is called Bethlehem blessed be the name of because he was of the house and the lineage of David amen and amen we are going to read another scripture blessed be the name of the Lord we read from Matthew chapter 1 it gives us the chronology of Jesus Christ the generation of Jesus we will just uh read from Matthew chapter 1 we read from verse 5 and Salon begot B of R and B begat of root and Jess and Jess beg David the king and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Hallelujah Hallelujah are we together then we will jump to verse 16 the same scripture or we start from 15 and elud beg elah and beg andan beg Jacob and Jacob beg Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ hallelujah hallelujah why little bethle why it had to be Shepherds amen and amen amen amen the city of Bethlehem was founded by [Music] salonon who Wason Salon was a great warrior you see we can never understand God we are only taught to believe the gentle prostitute that means the great great great great great great great great grandmother of Jesus [Music] Christ is a prostitute that is RAB and not just a prostitute was a gentile was a gentile not a Jew hallelujah hallelujah and the Jews are not supposed to marry any other religion or tribe except the Jew and look at a general High estate but will look down and marry a gentot hallelujah hallelujah God was trying to show us that in the Plan of Redemption the Gentiles comes in by marriage hallu Hallelujah so Bethlehem was founded byon and beg boas hallelujah hallelujah and boas also married a gentile Ruth hallelujah hallelujah was the nearest Kinsman who was Worthy to redeem hallelujah hallelujah in order to redeem Naomi he have to redeem root and when he is redeeming root he redeem Naomi amen and amen it is just as what the prophet says that Naomi T the Jewish church and Ruth Ruth ties a gentile Church hallelujah hallelujah he came to his own his own receiving him not but to them that Reed him he gave them power to become Sons and Daughters of God when Jesus came he told the disciples go nowhere unless after the lost sheep of Israel but unfortunately for our sake they rejected him to come and take a gentle and after our Redemption that is when they come in to be saved are we together blessed be the name of the Lord and that is how it was going then they gave bir toed Jessie and Jessie is a father of David and David was first anointed in Bethlehem David had two anointing this just fit in what I was telling you before the message when God sent to go to the house of Jesse I God I have anointed myself a king to go and anoint the king I chosen a king for myself God chose that King when King sa was already on the seat so when samel came the people of Israel knows and understand who a prophet is the coming of a prophet is not something to joke about they know he doesn't appear anyhow unless he has a message from God so when that Prophet comes around whatever he says they take it seriously so behold here com Sam with his anointing say hey Jesse God said I have chosen myself a again in your home Jesse begin to look around who is [Music] Jessie and who is in the house of Jess that God will choose a king okay if he's a king oh I have big boys big shoulders begin to call them and God is so wonderful hallelujah hallelujah any time they come I always demonstrated this way and begin to move the oil God begin to draw his hand the man begin to move the anointing but God draws it back he said not this one and they were coming Serv sons and were coming but God cannot make a mistake if God said he has chosen himself a king there must be a king here Jesse please tell me is it all your sons oh these are the big boys in the house I have one b a little rascal in the field taking care of my sheep please God does not make a mistake and God's Prophet does not make a mistake hallelujah hallelujah the man can make a mistake but not God's Prophet you have to come to a place to be able to separate between the man and GI but Abraham can make a mistake but Prophet Braham does not make a mistake if God says he have chosen himself a king then there must be a king in this house David said this man must be wasting his time hey you guys go and bring him he will see that a small boy he's nothing to write him about by the time David was appearing this time it was not samel moving anointing this time it was anointing moving hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there was no question because God God's Gift always find it Place God's anointing always find Place someone not ask [Music] question all on him David did not even understand he did not even know what was going on but he was taught to only believe ho hallelujah hallelujah many things will go on in your life things will go on in a church you might not understand you might not know why but only believe only believe that is why the scripture says God does not look at appearance of man but what he has placed in him what gods in David he has not place in his Brethren hallelujah hallelujah and it was David who was watching the fathership at the back side of the desert so God was training David at the back side of the shepherd to be able to watch over God's people God did not just choose anybody to come and Rule Israel and when David was on the back side of the desert a liar will take a lamb approach a liar open his mou and take the L David was so concerned about the father's business the life of the sheep need so much to that his very life that he was not really for just one ship to be taken away that my father has commed me to watch over the SE hallelujah hallelujah and be will take one and David will move and give the beard Ander another thing young men listen to me young Brothers listen to me when samel anointed David and told him God sent me to anoint you to be king of Israel David did not wake up the next morning I went to the Palace I am the new Young anointed king of Israel oh you have to wake up from the seat I am the chosen of God to come and sit down no no no it was not so do you know what happened even though he was anointed he knew there was an anointed king before him his anointing attracted persecution he went through trials but he didn't back down he respected the authority he respected the Elder and he was waiting waiting that the same God that anointed me to the king of his people in his appointed time Hallelujah hallu he will place me where I feel fit the vision is for appointed time hallelujah hallelujah though it may hallelujah hallelujah it will surely come to pass it will not carry anymore whatever Vision whatever word whatever promise God have concerning your life it will surely come to pass no matter how long it in God's appointed time hallelujah hallelujah it will come to pass it will turn no longer [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord it took David many years oh blessed be the name of the Lord God was working bringing him closer to that Vision what happened Israel went to war and go was blaspheming against them all the time and somehow somewhere just he called David come and take bread and water and go to the field find out how your brothers are doing give them the food and bring me a word David was not even chosen he was not selected be part of the battle but even though he was not chosen and selected God was mindful of him so to David he was just going to give a bread and come but somehow somewhere unfortunately fortunately it was at a time that David was coming that is where go made his last boast I said the last boast

meet your situation Hallelujah and the whole go fell down and the ground shake David went the two go C David lift up the head and Shout to the people of Israel oh children of Israel the UN SI phis has been defeated and you know what happened the moment David did that all the rest of the food soldiers begin to take their knif and went against Philistines Philistines the children of Israel they did not wait for that victory for David alone they took inspiration from the victory of David and they went ahead and were able to kill their enemies and that is what God does when God does something for somebody you must also take an inspiration from that Victory from that deliverance from that healing hallelujah hallelujah if God fill your brother with the Holy Ghost oh God now fill my sister the Holy Ghost Lord F me to oh Lord deliver that brother deliver me also hallelujah hallelujah enough of the David but do you know s f David all his [Music] David never killed Saul he had opportunity when Saul and the soldiers were asleep David could have SM him but David did not do that he only cut the piece of His Garment went to the high mountain and he shout immediately some want to take his sword David took the away took all the body guard their away so were disarmed is that not your s is that not your cloth and I love the response of Saul he said David thou are righteous than I that is the power of forgiveness when somebody do anything bad against you then you forgive that person it shows you are stronger that is why you can forgive but when you are not able to forgive is a sign of your weakness hallelujah hallelujah David remember even though sa is bleed the scripture says touch not man hallelujah hallelujah when the right time came and Saul died David was in Hebrew the Elders of Israel came to him and they anointed him again the second time before he was brought to Jerusalem to rule over the people of Israel so Bethlehem is a special place but the question is why little bethle why he had to be shepher imagine the birth of the great king the announcement of the birth of the great king when nothing but to Shepherds hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord now in verse seven of Luke 2 the scripture made it clear hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrap him in swander clothes and L him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the in Jesus the highest great Mah there was no place in the hotel all the hotels in ginger were fully booked we cannot receive anybody again Joseph didn't know what he was doing the only place was an in manger where LS are kept why must he be born day he must be born there because Jesus is the Lamb of God and Lambs are not born in the hospital Lambs are not born in the Palaces they are not born in the castles they are not b in the hotel Lambs are born in a stable oh blessed be the name of the Lord and that way in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night oh blessed be the name of the Lord there is a difference between the one that takes care of cattles and the one that takes care of PS and the one that care of goats and the one that takes care of sheep blessed be the name of the Lord why you have to be shepher sometime they are all called Shepherds or headsmen but the keeper of the sheep they are special but Abraham said when when he went to the old country in Israel in the daytime said he will see those animals following their Shepherd to go and eat but when night time came listen carefully all the other headsmen who put their animals in the cage and they go home and sleep the cattle is kept and go home and sleep the peig they keep them and go and sleep but he realize at night time only the Shepherd that keeps the Sheep he's the only one that does not live by the time the angel brought the news to the Shepherds the scripture says they were biding in the field keeping water over their flocks By Night hallelujah hallelujah what actually happened every night before they sleep every evening the shepherd begin to count the sheep and put them where they belong then when he finish the shepherd lays down at the entrance he lays down and sleep as he lays down to sleep he automatically becomes the door the shipold and Jesus says in John 10 that I am the door to the [Applause] sheep and when the shepherd is sleeping and hear any sound he wakes up hallelujah hallelujah no one can comes in or goes out unless through the in other words the shepherd is so mindful of his sheep until he lays down his life for the sheep and Jesus Christ he our great sheer hallelujah hallelujah he's the keeper of our soul he cares for us he loves us he nourish us hallelujah no one understand the she the sheer the sheer smells like a sheep he even talks like a sheep he even like the Sheep Hallelujah hallah and it takes a real shepher to differentiate the bleeding of a god of shepher why he had to be shepher hallelujah hallelujah and when one of the shepher the Sheep fall in a ditch the shepher don't care if he uses a rock and he uses a staff to pull out the sheep and he does not come out the shepherd does not care to enter the dit with the sheep and take it from there and David saw all those things in the wilderness and David said in Psalm 23 Psalm 23 thy rod and thy staff they comfort [Applause] me because the great Shepherd when we are going astray he has a ro he has a ro St that Deliver us from sin that Deliver Us from Wellness he is a chief shepher of the she hallelujah hallelujah and when one of the sheep get lost No Good Shepherd will say I have thousand sheep let him go no no no Jesus say which good shepher will not leave the 9 and go after the one just the one one soul mean so much to God each person here mean so much to God even the poorest of the brother or sister you so to God you can not be important to anybody but I want to tell you of God valuable and when a sheep get lost and he's finally found the shepherd takes the sheep and he put it at his shoulder the shoulder of a man is a strongest part of a man that is why Isaiah hallelujah hallelujah Isaiah 9:7 says and his government shall be upon his should and you see the shepherd coming with the lost sheep at the strongest path that he cannot be broken on the strong past that he cannot be lost hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and when the Sheep is sick he have a little bag bag the Shepherd have honey he have a limestone Stone then he will bring the Sheep closer he pour some horny on the stone as the Sheep begin to lick the h he Lees the Limestone as he Lees the sweetness he Lees the medicine in the stone there is honey in a rock for you my brother hallelujah hallelujah stone is a revelation the rock of Revelation as we are preaching if you are sick I want you to Le on the rock of there is money in a rock there is money in a rock you my sister hallelujah hallelujah and they get well they get well and when you were stubborn ship that doesn't always go with the group that doesn't not go with the group with the ship and if the shepherd is going this way and all the rest of the Sheep follow him you go this way tomorrow you go this way running from Pillar To Post running from this church to this church everybody must have a home church where you supported with your presence where you supported with your tide where you supported with your offering your presence your tith and your offering qualifies you to be a member of a local church it is not my mother is in that church or I was born in that church after you were born in that church where do you find yourself when you are that stubborn stubborn the shepherd himself will take your leg and you will break it and we next time go asay when your leg is broken the same way happens sometimes when you are going astray God breaks your leg God breaks your business then you know I have to go to prayer meeting I have to go and pray [Music] you will say you the shepherd you are a wicked man brother Abraham says One Day in Israel he saw a shepher with a little lamb that has broken leg oh my friend did the lamp fall off a clip the shepher said no I broke it you must be a wicked person he said no I love it you love it and you br the leg it was not minding me I have to break the leg so I can draw him closer and give him a little extra attention those I love I rebuke and I and rep and go back to do your first work hallelujah hallelujah the love of God is greater is hallelujah hallelujah the love of God is not the parental love for the baby that will play with the baby like this God's love is corrected if you ha correction you cannot be a Son of God only Bast that cannot be corrected no one is above the No diing No Pastor no pastor's wife is above the way the word is above everybody and it is a word that always correct the error we must have a spirit in us that accept correction if you cannot be corrected then I am sorry you are a goat [Applause] you are a God because who have seen a goat they are Bing before when you are baffing a goat leave me leave me leave me it's my private life go to struggle to be B but when they are Bing a sheep when the shepherd turns the head of the sheep theying him when he raise the leg of a sheep because a sheep has no right and Christians we have no right we have fited our rights to Christ leave me alone leave me alone you have no right you sisters when your husband touch you like this leave me alone who should you go and touch don't you know the day you took his name on The Altar you have no right of yourself all your right is given to that can the sister say Amen ah this amen is too small can the sister say a big

want me to go to kitchen and cook I'm tired I'm tired you don't want to cook why do you get married you to you can go to the kitchen when you marry leave your PhD in the school when you come home God has an [Applause] order God's order cannot be changed [Applause] there are qualities of a Shepherd hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that is why it had to be sheer the announcing of the birth of the Messiah was not told to the high priest come on church was told to theak but shepher hallelujah hallelujah it was not told to the president but the birth of the Messiah was revealed to the of the imagine the god of creation is coming and there must be a thousand Angel salute with a grown man coming from Heaven sitting on the throne and the high priest will come to the airport with King Herod to receive the king but when he came he was born a [Applause] baby not in the Hotel not in the Parliament House but he was born in a mjor that is the real Christmas the real Christmas is Christ to be [Applause] born and after he was born the mother did not get a clean pink pinky cloth to cover him he look everywhere look everywhere and at the back of the donkey the r that is spread on

multitude of heavenly host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest on Earth PE Good Will towards men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said to one another let us now go into Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the Lord has made us known and they came with haste and found Mary and Jose and a bab lying in a Manger they did not say oh I cannot make it this Sunday oh 31st night oh next January no when God speaks to your heart and he's calling you to give your life to him don't wait for tomorrow because you don't know tomorrow yesterday when we are having some water baptism we were about to go and there was a young boy sitting there looking at the program and he says I would like to baptize to but he didn't come to the church and we find out he was a Fisher man and he had been sitting there all the time and he have seen many water baptism but this one was different he said me I want where there is much water one of the brothers say we should follow the pastor to the church they take him through some teachings later they baptize him I said my brother do you know what God is dealing with his heart do

that had is wondered out those things which were told them by the she but Mary kept all these things and pounded over them in the and the shepherd returned glorifying and praising God for all the things we they have heard and seen as it was told them why it had to be shepher when they heard the announcement of the message of the first coming of Christ they went about preaching it they went about telling it that is shepher God sheep is not governed by CEO CEO not managers but Shepherds Jesus is a cheap Shepherd bless the be the name of the why it had to be sheer and little Bethlehem I want to some quot from the message God's rap gift paragraph 19 the prophet said thinking of Bethlehem and why it did happen to be that it was chosen to be the bir place of the kings of Kings King of and you know Bethlehem is a small place hallelujah hallelujah before we continue we can read from the book of mAh M 5 vers or vers let's see the prophecy 5ou bethle EP though be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of the shall come forth unto me that is to be the ruler in Israel who going forth have been from old Everlasting Hallelujah there was a prophecy by the prophet Mah that the ruler of the Jews the King of Kings the Prince of Life to be born in Bethlehem hallelujah hallelujah they are great cities Jerusalem they are Hallelujah they are Roman but why little butram Contin to say I often wondered why God didn't choose a more religious place these great events such as Shiloh Shiloh was the first place that AR was set after cross J G another great religious City or Zion on the mountain another great religious City or even the proud capital of Jerusalem with all his stages and sent through the age why didn't God choose [Music] Jerusalem come on church is this sing deep down blessed be the name of the Lord we continue from The Book of Matthew 2 we will come back to this quote and read Matthew 2: one I am bringing two different scenes together to see what God have for us how many of you are tired hallelujah hallelujah Matthew 2:1 now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Jud in the days of King behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem now the Bible did nor right three wise men look at it carefully the Bible say wise men but today every time we hear three wise men three wise men it was because they gave three gifts the wise men were more than three are we together they came from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and we have come to worship him they didn't say we have seen his star and we have come to worship the star but we have seen the star and we have come to worship they do not worship the messenger but they worship who the messenger introduced that is why we don't worship Abraham but we believe what he preached the messenger point to the birth of the word the birth of the word I I not to himself hallelujah hallelujah and when her the king heard this he was troubled all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests all the people together he of them where Christ to be born Jesus says search the scriptures search the scriptures in them you think you have life for they testify these these astrologers these wise men they saw a star in Jerusalem and they realize this is not a just normal star this star is a special star this star looks like enough star Hallelujah there is something about this something something special must be going on and they were following the star they were following the star and they were following the star and it begin to shout born and when they went to Jerusalem they Jerusalem is a capital city they will find a star there when they went to Jerusalem the star disappeared and they said unto him when the scribes and the said the scriptures they said to King Herod that in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet Mah hallelujah hallelujah and Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the princess of Judah for out of the shall come a governor people amen and Herod when he had privately called a wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to bethle and said go and search dently for the young child watch carefully the young child not a baby they asked he asked them when did the star appear but the Bible did not write the answer here but if you read between the lines you will know when it appears the Shepherds find a baby in a Manger but the wise man did not come to see a baby they came to see a young child go and search for the young child and when you are find him bring me a word that I may come and worship also when theye King they departed and low the star which they saw in the East went it came and stood over where the young child was the star disappeared then went to the World Council of churches the star got disappeared when they went to Rome they start disappear when they went to the headquarter of the denomination you cannot find a star in your denomination you cannot find your messenger the denominations Hallelujah when they came out of Jerusalem the W City saw the star hallelujah hallelujah and they begin to follow the star blessed be the name of the Lord and when they had heard a king they departed and low the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was they the star they Rejoice with exceeding great joy because the star was their guide without your guide you lost just as the god lost in Jerusalem without the star and without the messenger of your age you miss God's program [Applause] foration the message of the hour is a revelation of Jesus Christ it is not a revelation of the Prophet not come to introduce himself he came to introduce a bride Jesus Christ [Applause] the wi revealed hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and when they saw the star they Rejoice with great joy when you find the messenger of your age you rejoice with great joy and when they were come into the house they saw a young child marry his mother and they fell down and worship but they did not worship the star they worship Him the word revealed that the star LED them to and when they open their Treasures they presented unto him [Applause] what gifts gold and frankincense and M and being one of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed unto their own country in another way hallelujah hallelujah the gift they presented hallelujah hallelujah display the revelation of that young child the gift they gave show their Revelation they have AB the way but preach a message God's Gift always find it Place among all the things in the why did they give a gold to a little boy or does a baby need a go for they give a because stand for da that child is a god of Hallelujah Hallelujah so they G him a go that we have acknowledged you you are the and you cannot live higher than your revelation of the word the word we preach you can scream and jump Hallelujah that is good but you cannot jump higher than the revelation of the word don't be jumping because somebody is jumping because if I ask my friend why are you jumping I don't know just jumping I'm also jumping jump because you have cut a revelation don't jump because others are jumping and your sacrifice is your Revelation it brings us back to Cain and Abel Pastor Adam preached a message and they all say Amen now go and sacrifice K brought the farm produce butel said pastor Adam you said when God came what did he do he covered us with the lamb skin lamb skin then he took a lamb because before you get a lamb skin a lamp Must Die to get the skin without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin and he offered it so Abel

of the Lord you see and the man that is what they used to embar the de that was a gift they brought to him even though he was a baby so the gift displays reveals the life of Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord let us continue reading from God's rap gift why would he choose Bethlehem maybe it looked like he might have chose some place one of the great Cities of Refuge that would have protected his son in the case there some trouble come up the Refuge places like Roman Gilead that was a great Refuge that was built for the people could run into those Towers Kadesh was another great City of Refuge another great city of refug why would God pick on little Bethlehem then did not choose the greater cities and they had a greater name of more spiritual background but my sister you know hallelujah hallelujah God has a way of doing things God has a way of doing things just that just his own way about things I'm so glad he does sometimes he takes things that doesn't have a spiritual background he takes a boy from a parent of drunkard who are not Christians and said I want to use him as my messenger of my age or doesn't have any background at all and that's why he is God he can take something that is nothing and make something out of it oh you will say I am nothing in a church you are the one God is interested I am nothing in my family you are the one God want to take to make something out of you blessed be the name of the Lord I thank God that I worship a God that can take nothing and make something out of it praise the Lord and that's what makes him God that's what makes us love him that's what makes us poor people appreciate him because that even though we PO with no God can do great things with us if he ever get us under his control hallelujah hallelujah oh
