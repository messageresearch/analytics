and I pray that the message becomes a blessing to us all amen let's our Bibles and turn to the Book of Matthew 16th read out five from 13 to and for our stud tonight shall be studying on a church built on Revelation amen a church that is built on the foundations of Revelation amen and when Jesus came un into the coast of ceria Philip he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah oh one of theet he sayith unto them but whom say that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed thou Simon bonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it may the Lord add a blessing to his word we may get seated I want to also draw you to the to a quot here in in exposition of the seven Church ages in the revelation of Jesus Christ the prophet says the Roman Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter now that is real how could God build the church Upon A man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and cast while doing it God can't build his church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had allowed the ground at that spot and it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was the Revelation read it the way it is written flesh and blood has not revealed it but my father has revealed it and Upon This Rock of Revelation I will build my church the church is built on Revelation on thus say the Lord praise the name of living God so now here Jesus when he was speaking to the disciples he asked them a question yes who do they people say that I the son of man am praise the Lord because Jesus had had what the people spoke about he know what the people had spoken about all the sorts of names that they called but he wanted an answer from the disciples you who have been taught of me tell me what do people say that I the son of man am and some said some call you Elias some John the Baptist some call you Jeremiah or even one of the prophets but he desired a straight answer from them praise the Lord and he said unto them but whom do you say I am and they looked at one another then it took Peter praise the Lord Peter that stood up and said you are the Christ the son of the Living God and when he spoke it Jesus answered him and said blessed thou Peter for FLH and blood has not revealed this unto you flesh and blood has not given you this revelation of who the son of man I am but he said but it is my father who has given you this Revelation and then he said Upon This Rock praise the Lord Upon This Rock I will build my church praise the Lord and here the prophet has said the Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter because when Jesus said I say un thee thou Peter they now say now you see Jesus quoted and say is you Peter and Upon This Rock but Peter was not a rock why because the prophet said down here Jesus the Bible says Peter denied Jesus three times he not stand his ground so there is no way God could build a church upon Peter as a man as a man he could fail God can never build his church upon the foundations of a man why because man fails but he said that you are Peter Upon This Rock The Rock of Revelation the Revelation that Peter had who the son of man is the Revelation that you have know who the son of is is that Revelation that God buil his church praise the name Living God th Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and said the Protestants say that it's built on Jesus but the prophet of our says that the church is buil upon Revelation praise the Lord upon this Revelation I will build my church so now we want to study praise the lord we want to draw so many scriptures from the Old Testament on how God has built his church upon nothing else but his Revelation praise the lord we can draw now to Genesis 4 and and quote out verse three verse 5 praise the Lord this speak about Cain and Abel praise the Lord and the sacrifice that they brought before the Lord and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fast of the ground and offering unto the Lord and he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the F thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering AB but Cain un his offering he had not respect and Kane was very rough and his countenance fell now we notice that when these two children of of of of Adam brought the offering before the lordering had a purpose praise the Lord remember Adam and he had fallen and had come short of Grace and they had been driven out of the Garden of Eden and now it came it came to pass that they produced Kan and Abel and this grew up and they were of sound mind and they had a desire to have fellowship with God had a desire reconciled to God each of them had a desire serve the Lord and now it came to pass that they each wanted to please God and now Cain the says he brought of the uh he brought it came to pass that Kan brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord he went to his garden and he picked the best and he came and gave it unto the Lord praise the Lord and then Abel who says he brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the thereof the Lord had respect for Abel's offering and the Lord rejected that of Cain why because this offering that they brought before God hard to please God something that pleases you it should be something that you like it should be something that is a part of you something that is in your mind so now AB he got the mind of God the revelation of God and now he went and brought of the fings of his flock why because in the mind of God for reconciliation only thing that God provided was the shed blood even when even when Adam had sined praise the Lord he had heed for himself leaves but that's not what God desired God himself came down and he killed the lamb and blood was shed and then he closed them with a skin and so Abel went into the mind of God prise the Lord got the Revelation what God required for Fellowship he got the Revelation what God required for reconciliation that's why he went to his flock and get of the fing of his FL and the first one and he came and he presented it before the Lord praise the name Living God and now how did Abel get that how to take God himself to get his mind and give it to AB God got his mind revealed his man to AB and told AB what he required by Revelation Abel got of the flock and heer unto the Lord Upon This Rock The Rock of Revelation I will build my church praise the Lord so now Abel was building an altar upon which he would stand to Worship the Lord when he was trying to create a Reconciliation him and God he had to make an offering was in the mind of God praise the Lord and it is God that gave it unto him it is God that gives us his Revelation and the word revelation means unveiling unveiling something so God had to unveil his mind unveiled the purpose for the offering and then he unveiled it before before ab ab knew exactly what to do praise the Lord remember this is the first thing that they had BR they had not seen their father do it so they were puzzled on what they had to bring praise the Lord but God by knowledge AB was of the seed of Adam and because Abel was of the seed of God he was in the mind of God so he get through the mind of God a revelation of what God desired for his day praise the Lord he had to get now to where God had ordained for you to atone for your sins and get reconciled back to me you need to shed blood praise the Lord remember in Leviticus 4 when God spoke to Moses when he was giving him the instructions on how the children of Israel would get reconciled from sin and get reconciled back to fellowship whoever had sin God spoke to him and said the Bible says in in lus 4:2 verse one and the Lord spoke unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel saying if the soul shall sin through ignorance against any of The Commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not be done and shall do against any of them if the priest that is Anointed do to do if the priest that is Anointed do sin according to the sin of the people then let him bring for his sin which he has seened a young bulock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering and he shall bring the block unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord and shall lay his hand upon the Bullock's head and kill the bulock before the Lord now this was ahead of time and God was speaking to children of Israel the reconciliation and atonement for their sin and now here we find Abel that he went ahead of time praise the Lord and he got the instruction that God had provided atonment and so when he was bring the offering he brought exactly what was in the mind of God what was that it was based upon Revelation had to take God because God was establishing a tabac it was it was establishing an altar upon Abel could stand to Worship the Lord upon which ab could serve the Lord praise the Lord so he had to get into the pattern of God by Revelation to bring that which was acceptable before the Lord and Upon This Rock of I will build my church praise the Living God that does not make it doesn't mean that Kan was not sincere in his offering he was sincere that's why he got annoyed when God did not appreciate his offering because he toed to bring it he toiled he went to Pi of the best of his Harvest so he was a sincere man and he had a desire to please God and so he did his best to build the relation relationship back with God praise the Lord but it had to be by Revelation it had to be by Revelation that man could please God regardless of how good his offering was as long as it was not in the mind of God and as long as it was not after the pattern of God it couldn't please God praise the Lord so God rejected it but yet he tried his best it had be by Revelation know perfectly what God wanted praise the Lord he got this Revelation and he got this Revelation and he gave it to AB and did exactly what God wanted and the prophet says how did Abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God by faith he received the revelation of God of the blood by faith AB received the revelation of the blood didn't get such Revelation even though he had a commandment so he couldn't over the right sacrifice it was a revelation from God that made the difference and and gave AB eternal life it was the Revelation praise the Lord it had to be the Revelation praise the Lord that AB received and when he received it by faith he accepted it and he believed it and he went ahead to execute praise the Lord the Church of Jesus Christ the Church of God has to be built upon his Revelation because the revelation of God unveils the mind of God reation of gods the purpose of gods the pattern of God it brings us into knowledge of the person of Jesus Christ and Who We Are before him it gets us into the knowledge ration of the vision of the Bride in Jesus Christ and without that Revelation the church cannot stand without that revelation of the person of Jesus Christ the church cannot be built praise the Living God and now the Bible says in First Peter 2:9 praise the Lord you are a chosen generation a generation that has been chosen to know God to receive the revelation of Jesus Christ I know him personally he says you are a chosen generation Our royal priesthood our holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of the darkness Into His Marvelous Light that's chapter 2 verse 9 and how do we know we are a chosen generation how do we know that we are peculiar people how do we know we are a special people the word peculiar means special unique separated set up apart so we are peculiar people that have been separated and set apart by the message of Malachi 4 praise the Lord which is the voice of the seventh angel praise the Lord which brings us the message and the revelation of the person of Jesus Christ get the revelation of the person of Jesus Christ and revelation of who we are so the message of Mali it what places us into our position positions of knowledge to know who you are and where you are standing in the gospel who you are and where you're standing in Jesus Christ praise the Lord and so he says now that you have this knowledge after you have received this revelation you are a chosen generation you are a pecul people You' been set aside set apart for what you have received the of Jesus Christ and you have received of the life of Jesus and that makes you a special person that is awaiting the rupture you are a special people have got the knowledge of the mind of God in our of Mal praise the Lord and so now it's upon this message the Church of Jesus Christ is BU today this message the message of Jesus Christ the message which is the revelation of Jesus Christ his message is not will this message is not the voice of this message is the revelation of Jesus Christ the Bible says I think in Revelation CH 10 that at the sounding of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound mysteries of God should have been finished as declar servants the prophets and now this is the time where the seventh angel has sounded the Bible says the sounding of that seventh angel William Bram at the time of his message he says now the mysteries of God the revelation of God should have been unveiled before the bride to know who she is and come into full revelation of the person of Jesus Christ and upon that revelation of who she is upon the revelation of Jesus Christ this church is built this church is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ this church is not built upon the foundation of Bram praise the Lord just like the prophet said that God could not build his church Upon A man Peter because man fails God has to build his church upon his Revelation praise the Lord and our church the church of the Bride church is fully built upon that tribulation and that's why call us a peculiar people very special because we have the revelation of who you are you know you special people because you received him Christ who makes you special AB received this Revelation and he believed it and it made him special that's why he offered a special offering before the Lord you are special because you have received the word of God says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away you have received the word of God I have received the word of God so I have received the revelation of who Jesus is and Heaven and Earth shall pass away this word which you have received shall never pass away and upon that Revelation Christ will build his church this Church of Jesus Christ is built upon his Revelation praise the name of the Living God and the prophet says in the same message the exposition of the seven Church ages now you may take what your pastor says you may take what your pastor say or what the Seminary teaches and though it may be taught to you with eloquence until God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and that God is your savior you will never have eternal life it is the spiritual Revelation that does it he says you may sit under your pastor and your pastor May teach you and yes he can teach you with a lot of eloquence but until God himself reveals this to you this revelation until God himself revealed itto Peter and said the person that standing before you is Jesus the Christ and the prophet says until God reveals it to you that Jesus is the Christ the same Revelation that was given unto Peter the same Revelation that is given unto us know that Jesus is the Christ he says until you come to know that that it is the blood that cleanses you not your good works not your Good Conduct but that the blood that cleanses you and that God is your savior says you will never have eternal life it is the spiritual Revelation that does it and says in another part but prevailing overcoming church is built on Revelation so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us if the church is not built upon the foundations of man praise the Lord and is built upon the foundations of the revelation of God that means the church will depend on Revelation will depend on the direction of the of the Holy Spirit the preachers the teachers the apostles praise the Lord will all be led by revelation of the word of God as they are being led by of the word of God they are able to bring the mind of God to the church praise the Lord they are able to bring the truth of the word to the church to reveal the truth of us without that Revelation there is no the church can come to knowledge of the truth of Jesus Christ praise the Lord it says you can be taught well praise the Lord but until you get the Revelation that there is but one God you cannot have this eternal life you until you have the revelation until you have the Revelation that Jesus Christ is but our God you cannot come you cannot have this eternal life is eternal life the person of Jesus Christ himself it is the life of God himself that he gives unto us freely by his grace and because he is eternal receive of his life we have received Eternal and so we become Eternal and we know it is simply a matter of time praise the Lord when we get to know and come this revelation of who you are that you are not who you are what you are seeing but you are bearing the life of Jesus Christ praise the Lord you now come to know that it is simply a matter of time praise the Lord and the scripture shall be fulfilled but when we shall see him when we shall see him we shall look at him and we shall know that he is praise the Lord as we are we shall see him and we look at ourselves and we see ourselves in him why because he has given us a part of his life because the life that we are bearing the life is eternal Jesus Christ himself praise the Living God and that's what the Revelation does it has revealed unto us the person of who we are the same Revelation that went down to job and revealed to him who he was even when he saw that he was Ro he had expectation he had hope that it was a matter of time praise the Lord that's why he confessed and said even if his body Ro praise the Lord he knew that at the end of the day he will see his Gods praise the Lord that is the the hope that we have that even if our bodies die before the rapture we know that it shall be a matter of time and still we shall be changed praise the lord we have that hope because we have the revelation of who Jesus Christ is Upon This Rock I will build my church praise the Lord and He will never give up on his church he will never give up the church that is been built upon his Revelation the prophet says in the message Abraham's Covenant confirmed now you will make your mistakes you say brother Bram no matter what I would ever do I've never I I would never be worthy right but look you say brother Bram at one time didn't believe this message that's right I guess many of you didn't I wouldn't have done it I guess myself I couldn't have done it unless God revealed it to me it is a revelation the church is built on that Revelation without the Revelation you'll never see it you are blind praise the Lord when you read the Bible the scripture say that the true baptism is in the name of Jesus Christ without the Revelation you can never see it when the scripture says you should worship and serve only the Lord God only one God SC says the Lord is but one God without Revelation you cannot see it when the scripture say the fullness of the godhead embed in Jesus Christ without Revelation you cannot see it you still see through existence of God prise the Lord when Jesus said unless you eat of My Flesh and drink of my blood you have no part of me you have no part in me and you have no eternal life without Revelation you cannot see what Jesus was speaking about without Revelation praise the Lord you cannot have the hope that the Rapture will come without the Revelation when you read Mal 4 praise the Lord you cannot see the scripture in Mali 4 is declaring the coming of two prophets the first that is going to declare the first coming of Jesus Christ that is going to take the heart of the children their father Lord you cannot see malach 45 is the voice of the seventh angel without the Revelation you cannot come into the knowledge of the word of God see it you shall be told unless you you receive this Revelation you cannot receive it and believe it we are are very peculiar people generation God has allowed us to receive of this revelation of who we are people God has given us the grace to get Revelation praise the Lord and the things that we look at as simple are not simple before the eyes of men praise the Lord when you first heard when you first heard about the scripture when you first heard when Peter was preaching said unto them when they asked him what shall we do that we may receive this life and the and Peter said repent each one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ praise the Lord without Revelation you can you can read that scripture many years praise the Lord and you will not see that you will not see that the true baptism in the name of Jesus Christ but when Revelation knocks your way the Lord you don't need so many scriptures about when you first heard about it and Peter was proclaiming and said each one of you and bapti in the name of Jesus Christ he said I receive it somehow you believed it you didn't need to know that Jesus at one point he told his disciples when he was with them and had made them at the mountain he said go out preach the gospel and make rest of the world my disciples Bing in the name you didn't need to be told that Jesus Christ is that name that Jesus was referring to when you heard it because of Revelation you believed it and you took it up praise the Lord you didn't need another explanation about because you already had a revelation the Revelation was before you and Christ himself was making himself known to you he didn't need a third part explanation Revelation they read the scripture many read the scripture they don't believe it because they are not a part of it we are are chosen people the Lord we are people that have receive this Revelation and upon this Revelation I will build my church praise the Lord he said until God revealed it himself unto you without the Revelation you will never see it so I'm just going to put this in so you'll understand that's the prophet he say so I can give you a little spot of Grace here when ain't going to be too long you're going to change your mind some of you some of you w't but remember when Sarah first heard that that man when which she is a type of the church when she had that seen that sign take place to Abraham she actually laughed about it in her heart and disbelieved and doubted it ever being so it is that right at that time God would have rubbed her off would have rubbed her name off but he couldn't she's a part of Abraham and if you've really not been excited and walked up in Emotion not got some not got some church but really receive the Holy Ghost and you really part of Christ and still a little skeptic in your mind that God will not shove you off from that and said and you and you have a little a little skeptic in your mind God will not shove you off from that you have really received the Holy Spirit and you are cly part of Christ you still get a little skeptic in your mind God will not shove you off from that because he can't a part of Christ he will bring you to the truth by his Revelation praise the Lord just hang in there Behold a great than Solomon is here now if we talk fundamentalism if we talk about fundamentalism being fundamental now was just as fundamental as was both boys was wait was wanting to find favor with God brought a sacrifice buil an altar just as sincere as was but Abel by spiritual Revelation on which the Church of Jesus Christ is built spiritual revelation of the will and the word of God off a sacrifice that God was pleased with praise the Lord and now I believe that's the day that we are living in Praise the Lord yes sir it isn't what and how good a person is was a good person was very good and he obeyed the Commandment bring an offering before the Lord he was obedient before the Lord the Lord so it isn't how good you are praise the Lord but it must be the revelation of God praise the lord we can take another scripture we see that when had received that dream praise the Lord he interpretation and we know that God has always had his influence in every age God has always had his words estblished among his people and God has already shown his Revelation upon his people he shines his Revelation every dispensation and now in the times of Nezar we he had his people there praise the Lord he had Daniel he had shra and the rest of them there praise the Lord and so he called to have a dream and he caused him forget that dream but yet he knew that he had he had had a dream praise the Lord so now he woke up and he came to his people I said I had a disturbing dream I don't know what the dream was I don't know what the dream meant so he needed people to get to get into his mind the mind of God to bring down this dream and so he went his mag and he T them please I want know the dream and they they struggled King we can tell you this is not possible only the gods can do this man cannot get this revelation the dream that you have received what were they doing they were testifying it's only possible with god dream be made known praise the Lord and now he passed a decree he passed the decree was going to kill all the wise men they brought Daniel before him and Daniel said King just give us a little time give us a little time we shall come back here and we shall tell you the dream interet what was he doing he was waiting on Revelation from God he moved away from the Pres of the king his people and they went to pray and fast they waiting on the mind of you are waiting God to bring down his mind you are waiting God to unveil his mind because God had revealed his mind to nebz didn't know what it was God himself to bring his Revelation give it to his church that the church could be established and when they wait on the Lord they kept waiting on the Lord they knew that only God could do it so they went to inquire of the Lord and they waited on that Revelation and when it came to pass the of the Lord came down the spirit of the Lord came down it fell upon Daniel and said Daniel you are a chosen generation people a priesthood I will make known my mind to you I unil the person of me before you my church in this place may be established and so God gave the Mind God gave the dream until Daniel and Daniel came the following day he came smiling he praising the Lord he was full of Revelation he had received the Revelation he was not afraid to go and stand before NE instantly the church was established and the of the Lord for those men increased and the church was established upon that Revelation that even when it came to pass that nezeh again he laid a SN before the church he made he made an image this image that it should be shadra and ab they had received this Revelation and they had built upon the Revelation is but one God and only that God should be when they came out and they had they had the instruction that there was another God to be wor said no we have the revelation we have the knowledge that there are is by one God only him should be and they said even if it means death We Shall Not Bow Down To Worship that other God why because the church has been established upon the Revelation that there is but one God and the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Living God this church today been built upon that rock has been built upon that revelation there is but one God the Lord Jesus Christ and regardless of the distress regardless of the persecution this church is established and it shall not STG and he shall not come short of this Grace he shall not come short of this wisdom knowledge that there is but one God praise the living always establishes his church upon his Revelation praise the Lord yes sir he did the same thing Jacob praise the Lord the same way he visited AB the man he visited Jacob remember Isaiah 43 ver1 God calls Jacob his own people because Israel my own people and now how did God praise the Lord come to calling Israel people given Jacob the Revelation upon which he would build the na Israel praise the Lord there was a time we all read the scriptures there is a time when ISAC was going to bless bless and Jacob was the first BN but he sold his birth he had sold he had sold it to Jacob and he wanted to steal it away at the time of being blessed so their father was old and he was striken in age and he couldn't see praise the Lord but now Jacob was a fair man praise the Lord And now when the time came both of them just like it was with and C they both had to bring something before their praise the Lord and now you know what is was doing went hunting because he knew what his father wanted and now Jacob God had to provide a way for Jacob to receive this BL because Jacob he had been predestinated receive this BL he had been predestinated out of out of him that God could form a nation out of Jacob God had promised Abraham that he would out of him would come and this was come by Jacob at that time want to take that place somehow God provided it is Jacob who received that blessing praise the Lord and now we see that when it came to Isaiah 413 verse one says now thus say the Lord God that created thee oh Jacob that he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name thou mine when thou passest through the waters I will be with youe this is a confirmation this is a God is trying to confess confession that God to Jacob because Jacob had received this Revelation who God was jaob had received this and now we are peculiar people God has chosen us and he has given us his Revelation he says I have chosen thee and I have created thee fear not I have redeemed thee I have called thee by your name for you are mine and therefore when you pass through the waters that church that is built upon the the foundation of of Jesus Christ and is called by his name Christ himself he says I have called you and therefore even if you pass through the waters I will be with you and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee and when you walk through the fire thou shall not be burned that is a kind godra and Abed they had received this Revelation praise the Lord and even when they moved through the fire the promise was there that even when you move through the fire you shall not be burned so because they had a revelation they move through the fire not even smoke touched them says neither shall the flame K upon thee the promise that God gives to his people whom he has called by his name we are people that have received this revelation we are people that have received this word we have been identified by his word praise the Lord we have been identified by his word his promises for us are yes and amen if you pass through the waters the rivers shall not overflow you what does that mean this shall come but you anchored you've been anchored Faith have been anchored unfailing word of God and Earth shall pass away but this word upon which your faith has been buil shall never pass away says when you pass through the waters I will be with you and the rivers shall never overflow upon thee for I am the Lord God th God the of Israel th savior amen so that's how God bu is he buil it upon his ration and every time presented himself to them I am the Lord God presented himself as only one God praise the Lord and once Israel got that Revelation and moved by that Revelation even they even when they came the cures remember when Moses was moving the children of Israel and wanted to cast them praise the Lord and he had caused balam to C them because the promise of the Lord was with them and the of the Lord was with them there were a people that had been chosen to believe and worship only one and so the pris of God was with them they knew who they were and even if the curses came there the curses could not touch them praise the Lord the Cur could not touch them because they were a people of the Lord praise the Lord distress shall come TR shall come yes sir snares shall come and they shall try to fight against the church but as long as this church is built upon the foundation praise the Lord that never fath it shall anchor itself it shall Anchor It fath anchor our faith upon the word of God and even when these trou come they shall swing us s shall swing us poverty shall swing us and whatever circumstance shall swing us but we shall remain unch the unfailing word of God a church that has been built upon revelation of Jesus Christ he knows that even if these troubles come I have a promise the promise of the father he says he shall go before me and as long as that promise still stands this trouble shall come go before me shall L the ground a promise that is given to that church as long as friends we anchor upon that that promise we an our faith upon the promises of God we an ourselves upon that Revelation he said here when he was speaking to Jacob that I shall go before he shall go before us in every way even if world come our way Christ himself he will come and you come the why because you've anchored our fa upon that word our faith upon the revelation of Jesus Christ praise the Lord let me read out the last here in the same message is here he says now God in all ages always had gifts in his church has always Vindicated his people wherever you see the Living God you see the signs of a living God now there was a mo upon the hill and he was offering he had seven altars did and he had seven blocks he had seven RS that bulock a clean sacrifice R speaking of the coming just one rally he was just as fundamental as Moses was but the only difference was that God was confirming Moses by a smed rock and and a serpent and a pillar of fire of a king in there and God was vindicating that down there that is the difference so God had provided to the children of Israel praise the Lord he provided them with a pillar of fire praise the Lord and they were sure that the presence of God was with them and each time they were moving in the darkness of night the of fire was there praise the Lord so even when they errored praise the Lord and now the snakes started biting them here and there God provided another sign that his presence was seal with them happen looked up there he was healed and that made a difference whoever believed it when they were beaten I looked there they did not die but whoever did not believe after they were SM and they didn't look there they died that's what made the difference praise the Lord their FA had been built upon this Foundation they knew they had a pillar of Fire Lord and the Propet says and what made the difference was that God was confirming Moses by a SM by a smen rock a serent a pillar of fire praise the Lord in the camp that the King was there God was vindicating he was down there and now to us he has given us his word he has given us his promise praise the Lord and we know that his promises as Eternal and he never fails he never fails in his promis praise the Lord when he promised Jacob the Lord promised him that even if your you my people go through the fire you will not be burned and it came to pass when M and his friends when they went through the fire they were not burned his promises never failed so if he has given us his promise of etal life we sure know that we have eternal life praise the Lord he has promised us that he shall come back to take us in the rupture surely know that one of these days he shall come back for us and shall take the r his promises for his church never failed why because he has established this church upon his own Revelation that is a God and that is our church don't buil upon man bu upon the of a pastor no buil Upon Jesus Christ and this church a built upon that revelation shall never fail may the Lord bless you Amen brother [Applause] mes we can get on our feet as we get into worship they that wait upon the Lord shall renew the strength the they shall Mount up with wings as a KN go
