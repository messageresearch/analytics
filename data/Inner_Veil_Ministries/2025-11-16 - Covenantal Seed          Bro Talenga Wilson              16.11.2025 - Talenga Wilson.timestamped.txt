[31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. Loving precious
[31:19] father,

[31:37] We are so grateful this morning.
[31:40] Lord, you have permitted us once again
[31:44] to be back in the house of God. Lord
[31:47] God, you spoke in thy word that where
[31:51] two or three
[31:54] shall gather in my name,
[31:57] I will always be in their midst.
[32:00] And precious father, we invite you this

[32:41] teaching of thy word.
[32:43] Precious Lord you may come and take a
[32:46] total preeminence.
[32:49] May you take this your word
[32:51] Lord God and father. May you speak into
[32:53] our hearts.
[32:55] May you circumcise the lips of the
[32:56] speakers
[32:58] that Lord they may only speak thy minds
[33:01] and may also circumcise Lord the ears of
[33:04] the audience
[33:05] that Lord may receive your word this
[33:09] morning as you have prepared for each
[33:12] one of us.
[33:14] Bless us all together. Lord, we bless
[33:16] our pastors
[33:19] wherever they are, oh God. We bless
[33:22] Pastor James. We bless Pastoral
[33:26] and their entire families, Lord, that
[33:29] you may bless them, oh God, with good
[33:31] health, with protection and anointing,
[33:34] Lord, that they may continue, Lord, of
[33:36] glory, in the ministry of your word.
[33:40] Father Lord Jesus come and take
[33:44] I commit myself to you Lord just as a
[33:47] person not worthy fil with filthy
[33:51] garments
[33:53] God when you come down father that I may
[33:56] hide behind thee oh God I know I'll be
[33:59] able to speak Lord the patches of blood
[34:02] permit it oh God in the most precious
[34:04] name Jesus Christ I pray
[34:08] &gt;&gt; amen Amen. Amen.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be here this morning?
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Our pastors are not around.
[34:22] They have barriers.
[34:27] Pastor James,
[34:29] the sister lost a husband
[34:33] &gt;&gt; and that sister is also a sister to
[34:36] pastor Eal's wife.
[34:44] So the two families are not with us
[34:46] today.
[34:49] They are going to be part of the barrier
[34:51] today.
[34:53] So we keep them in prayer.
[34:55] Amen. So I was permitted
[34:59] and asked by the pastor
[35:02] to stand in the gap today.
[35:04] That's why I was not able to preach in
[35:06] the Sunday school.
[35:09] Amen. Will you allow me to speak to you?
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; You know, it's not me that will be
[35:15] speaking.
[35:17] I believe it's the grace and the spirit
[35:20] of God that will be speaking to us this
[35:22] morning.
[35:24] Amen. And I have just yielded myself
[35:28] as a vessel to be used by God
[35:33] to speak to each of our minds
[35:36] to speak to each of our hearts.
[35:39] Amen. So now without wasting a lot of
[35:42] time,
[35:43] I'll invite you to the reading of the
[35:45] word
[35:47] in the book of Romans
[35:49] chapter 9 verse 8.
[35:53] Amen. Amen.
[36:05] The scripture says
[36:08] &gt;&gt; that is
[36:12] that is they which are the children of
[36:15] the flesh. These are not the children of
[36:17] God. But the children of the promise are
[36:20] counted for the seed.
[36:34] For this is the word of promise. At this
[36:37] time will I come and Sarah shall have a
[36:41] son.
[36:53] And not only this, but when Rebecca also
[36:57] had conceived by one, even by our father
[37:01] Isaac,
[37:13] for the children being not yet born,
[37:16] neither having done any good or evil,
[37:20] that the purpose of God according to
[37:22] election may stand not of works but of
[37:26] him that calleth. Amen.
[37:44] Amen. Amen. That the purpose of God
[37:49] according to election
[37:52] may stand
[37:54] not of works
[37:57] but of him that calleth.
[38:01] Praise the Lord. less than Ephesians 1
[38:04] verse one
[38:07] to verse 6.
[38:10] Amen. Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; The scripture says
[38:14] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[38:17] will of God to the saints which are at
[38:20] Ephesus and the faithful in Christ
[38:23] Jesus.
[38:32] Grace be to you and peace from God our
[38:35] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:47] Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all
[38:51] the spiritual blessings in heavenly
[38:53] places in Christ
[39:04] according as he has chosen us in him
[39:06] before the foundation of the world that
[39:08] we should be holy and without blame
[39:11] before him in love. Amen.
[39:22] having predestinated us unto the
[39:25] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[39:27] himself according to the good pleasure
[39:30] of his will
[39:39] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[39:42] wherein he has made us accepted in the
[39:46] beloved
[39:55] according as he has chosen us.
[39:59] In him before the foundation of the
[40:02] world,
[40:04] a covenantal seed
[40:08] elected by for knowledge.
[40:12] Praise the Lord.
[40:14] May the Lord add a bless be seated.
[40:18] Amen. Amen. So for this morning I want
[40:22] to be sharing on a convened
[40:27] by fornowledge.
[40:31] So now here in Romans,
[40:33] the scripture speaks about Isaac and and
[40:36] and his father Abraham
[40:41] and speaks about the word of promise
[40:45] which God had given to Abraham
[40:49] that he would have a son.
[40:53] And the scripture says this is the word
[40:55] of promise.
[40:58] It was God speaking.
[41:00] At this time I will come.
[41:05] And when he said I will come, he said
[41:08] and Sarah
[41:10] shall have a son.
[41:13] That was a promise.
[41:15] Praise the Lord. And now according to
[41:17] Sarah.
[41:19] She couldn't see where the sun was
[41:21] coming from.
[41:23] According to Abraham, he couldn't see
[41:26] the sun.
[41:27] Praise the Lord. But yet according to
[41:30] God,
[41:31] the son had already existed.
[41:35] And so God told Abraham
[41:38] that it has to be your son.
[41:40] There shall be hair over your property
[41:44] because God had rather seen the
[41:45] existence of the son
[41:48] even when the son was not yet in
[41:50] manifestation.
[41:52] And then he said, "For the children
[41:54] being not yet born,
[41:57] neither having done any good or evil,
[42:02] that the purpose of God
[42:05] according to election
[42:09] may stand." Praise the Lord, not of
[42:12] works, but of him that.
[42:16] And then he comes here in Ephesians
[42:19] and says, "Grace be to you and peace
[42:24] from God our father and from the Lord
[42:26] Jesus Christ.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the God and father of our
[42:30] Lord Jesus Christ
[42:34] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[42:36] blessings
[42:39] with all spiritual blessings
[42:42] in the heavenly places in Christ."
[42:45] And then he says in verse four,
[42:48] according as he has chosen us in him
[42:54] before the foundation of the world.
[42:58] So now we see where we are here. We see
[43:01] ourselves
[43:03] that we were chosen in Christ
[43:06] before even the world was laid
[43:10] by calling us. He has chosen us in him.
[43:13] Before the foundation of the world,
[43:17] we should be holy
[43:20] without blame.
[43:23] Before him,
[43:25] having predestinated us unto the
[43:27] adoption of children,
[43:31] But Jesus took himself
[43:35] upon the good pleasure of his will. So
[43:38] now we see here in the scripture that
[43:42] God shows us by for knowledge. He chose
[43:47] us in him
[43:49] even before laying the foundation of the
[43:52] world
[43:54] that we should be holy.
[43:56] Praise the Lord. So he sought about us
[44:00] and our holiness
[44:02] even before the world was late.
[44:06] And then he says then he chose us in him
[44:10] to live a holy life.
[44:13] Praise the Lord to the glory of him that
[44:17] will
[44:19] praise the Lord. Let's listen close
[44:21] here. The choice of God.
[44:24] I want to liken you today
[44:27] the natural birth.
[44:29] Praise the Lord. You see each time the
[44:31] prophet preached,
[44:33] he picked out a natural
[44:36] to type the spiritual
[44:39] because it is the natural
[44:41] man. What is the spiritual realm?
[44:45] So now the choice of God must liken it
[44:48] to the natural birth.
[44:51] Every man, every young man, praise the
[44:55] Lord, right from their infants,
[44:59] they have a seat
[45:02] or they have seats
[45:05] of their children
[45:07] whom they would bear when they grow up.
[45:11] Praise the Lord. Every little baby,
[45:14] every little boy that you see, he has
[45:17] his children with him.
[45:20] Praise the Lord. So as he is growing, in
[45:23] him are the seeds of his children.
[45:28] In him are his children,
[45:31] but yet they are not yet into
[45:33] manifestation.
[45:34] But the reality of it
[45:37] is that he has his children in me.
[45:41] Praise the Lord. We see brother Cyrus
[45:43] here. He's not yet married. He has no
[45:46] children. But in him are his children.
[45:51] Praise the Lord. He is carrying his
[45:53] children with him
[45:55] in form of his seat. Praise the Lord.
[45:59] But yet his children are not yet
[46:01] manifested.
[46:03] Praise the Lord. But now when the
[46:04] brother grows up and he has reached his
[46:08] stage of maturity,
[46:10] and he feels he wants to have a family,
[46:14] he will go get a woman and make her his
[46:18] wife and then they will begin to bear
[46:22] children.
[46:23] But before that, the brother cannot call
[46:27] his children.
[46:29] Praise the Lord. He even doesn't know
[46:32] the picture. He has doesn't know how his
[46:36] children shall look like.
[46:38] Praise the Lord. And yet he is very sure
[46:42] that in him are his children. That's why
[46:45] he makes a choice and says, "I want to
[46:48] marry because now I want to have
[46:51] children."
[46:54] Praise the Lord. Now he has faith
[46:57] that he has the seed. He has faith that
[47:01] he can bear children. Praise the Lord.
[47:04] And now because of that choice, he makes
[47:08] to go and have children
[47:11] by way of marriage.
[47:14] Praise the Lord. He is very confident
[47:17] that he shall bear children.
[47:20] But as long as he's still single,
[47:23] he can say he has children,
[47:25] but yet he has them, but they are not
[47:28] yet in manifestation.
[47:31] Until they into manifestation,
[47:34] That's when the brother will call his
[47:36] children by name.
[47:39] Praise the Lord. And that's exactly how
[47:41] we were.
[47:44] The Bible says according he has chosen
[47:47] us in him before the foundation of the
[47:52] world.
[47:53] So now in Christ, before the foundation
[47:56] of the world, we existed in him as a
[48:00] seat. against God. We existed in him as
[48:03] children
[48:05] although we were not yet into
[48:06] manifestation.
[48:08] Praise the Lord. And now when Silas
[48:11] bears his children,
[48:13] praise the Lord, he now begins to name
[48:16] them.
[48:18] Now he identifies them.
[48:21] He says this woman shall be called
[48:24] Joseph.
[48:26] Praise the Lord. Because Joseph has now
[48:29] come from his loins.
[48:32] Praise the Lord. And now Joseph is into
[48:34] manifestation.
[48:36] And when he looks at Joseph, he shall
[48:38] say, "This is my son Joseph."
[48:42] Because Joseph has been brought into
[48:45] manifestation.
[48:47] Praise the Lord. So now when God came to
[48:49] Sarah and Abraham, he told them, "You
[48:53] will bear children."
[48:55] Why? Because God had already made those
[48:58] children. Before even Sarah had met
[49:03] Abraham,
[49:05] before even Sarah and Abraham were made,
[49:09] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. And he saw them because
[49:13] he created them before the foundation of
[49:16] the world. Praise the Lord. And so when
[49:19] we are born, we don't have a choice of
[49:23] who we shall be born to.
[49:26] We have no choice. We select our
[49:28] fathers. Praise the Lord. We have no
[49:31] choice. We select our children.
[49:35] Praise the Lord. But yet our children
[49:38] don't have also a choice of who their
[49:41] father will be
[49:43] by default
[49:46] that they are our children. My children
[49:50] are my children by predestination.
[49:54] God prepared
[49:56] that I will have children. Praise the
[49:59] Lord. So when the time came and I
[50:02] produce children, they have no choice
[50:05] who their father should be because in
[50:08] the first place
[50:10] they were born in me. Praise the Lord.
[50:13] God created me and he created me along
[50:16] them
[50:18] when they come manifestation.
[50:20] Praise the Lord. They only coming to
[50:24] manifest that which was a part of me.
[50:28] Praise the Lord. So the same way the
[50:31] scripture says
[50:33] according as he has chosen us in him
[50:36] before the foundation of the world.
[50:39] Praise the Lord. That means before the
[50:42] foundation of the world
[50:44] thought about you
[50:47] thought about me and then he chose us.
[50:50] Praise the Lord that our existence
[50:54] already existed in him before the
[50:57] foundation of the world. So now when we
[51:00] are born into the world, we are simply
[51:03] manifesting that
[51:05] which existed in Christ before the
[51:08] foundation of the world.
[51:11] Praise the living God. So now you are
[51:13] who you are today
[51:15] because God chose you before the
[51:18] foundation of the world. So now he has
[51:21] brought you here simply as a
[51:24] manifestation
[51:25] of that which was part of him before he
[51:29] laid the foundations of the world.
[51:32] And then he said he has chosen us to be
[51:35] holy.
[51:37] Praise the Lord. He has chosen you to be
[51:38] holy. He has given you the grace to be
[51:43] holy. Not because he has a choice now,
[51:47] but because you were meant to be holy.
[51:52] Because you were from God.
[51:55] If you are from God, you must be holy.
[51:59] That's why he has chosen you to be holy.
[52:03] Praise the Lord. So your holiness is
[52:06] simply picking up from your your seat.
[52:10] which is in God according as he has
[52:13] chosen us in him in Christ Jesus before
[52:18] the foundation of the world.
[52:20] Praise the Lord. You are here today
[52:25] because God knew you.
[52:27] You are here today because God chose
[52:30] you. Praise the Lord. You didn't choose
[52:34] to be here. You didn't choose to believe
[52:36] what you believe. You believe what you
[52:39] believe because you are recognizing your
[52:42] position
[52:44] that you were in him who is holy. So
[52:48] when he speaks his word and you are able
[52:51] to recognize it that means is the deep
[52:55] that is responding to the deep. It is
[52:57] his word that you came from that speaks
[53:01] to you and you are able to hear. When
[53:04] you hear you are able to recognize that
[53:08] this is speaking about you how you
[53:11] believe. Praise the Lord. You are not
[53:14] believing today. You are not coming to
[53:16] God today. You were already in him
[53:20] before you were even born. Praise the
[53:23] Lord. So now when time comes
[53:26] and he begins to speak, when time comes
[53:30] and begins to search for you, Jesus
[53:33] said,
[53:34] I came to seek and save them that were
[53:40] lost. Lost from where? Because they are
[53:43] part of him. They are part of God. And
[53:47] now when you born to the world, they
[53:50] somehow got lost.
[53:53] But God is very faithful. They even have
[53:56] thought about how he would save us.
[54:00] Praise the Lord. By for knowledge he saw
[54:03] us into existence.
[54:06] Even before we were even before the
[54:09] world was laid.
[54:11] And by poor knowledge he saw how we
[54:14] would be perverted.
[54:17] Before we were even here and by
[54:21] knowledge he thought about a plan
[54:25] how he would reconcile us back to him.
[54:28] And so he brought the lamb of God.
[54:31] Behold the lamb of God that was slain
[54:35] before the foundation of the world. For
[54:37] he slew his lamb.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; He slew the lamb in his mind. Praise the
[54:44] Lord. He slew the lamb Jesus Christ.
[54:48] So he would die and then he would bring
[54:51] the blood
[54:53] to atone for our sin,
[54:56] to atone for our mistakes.
[55:00] This is a plan that God had even before
[55:04] he laid the foundation.
[55:07] Praise the Lord. So when we were born,
[55:10] we were already born when the plan had
[55:14] been laid.
[55:16] The plan to save you didn't come when
[55:19] you had the gospel. The plan to save you
[55:23] was written before the foundation.
[55:28] Jesus is existing.
[55:31] He did not exist at the time when he was
[55:34] born by Mary.
[55:36] He existed in the mind of God before the
[55:40] foundation of the world.
[55:43] God knew
[55:45] the devil would pervert
[55:48] us from the lineage of God.
[55:53] Satan will try to take us off the
[55:55] stripes
[55:57] and he thought about you and says this
[56:00] Silus, this Wilson, this S is mine and
[56:06] he has to be mine and nobody will be
[56:10] able to take him away from you.
[56:13] And so he laid a plan. I said, I know
[56:17] when he's born, he'll be born with
[56:19] amnesia.
[56:21] Praise the Lord because he will be born
[56:23] in sin.
[56:25] But then I must lay a plan. But how I
[56:29] will reconcile him to
[56:32] say behold the lamb. So he killed the
[56:35] lamb to die for us before the foundation
[56:39] of the world. So when Jesus came, he was
[56:43] only fulfilling that
[56:45] he was bringing to manifestation
[56:48] the plan that God had before the
[56:52] foundation of the world.
[56:54] Praise the Lord. And I once said this,
[56:56] brother. We did not believe.
[56:59] We simply recognized
[57:02] the voice that spoke to us. And that
[57:05] voice was speaking directly to our
[57:07] hearts.
[57:09] Because in our spirit is the seed of
[57:12] God. In your spirit, your spirit is the
[57:16] seed of God because your spirit came
[57:20] from God.
[57:22] As long as you have the spirit of God in
[57:24] you,
[57:26] you will somehow hear the voice
[57:29] and recognize that this voice is
[57:31] speaking to you.
[57:33] That's when you shall say, I believe.
[57:36] Praise the Lord. There is no you are
[57:37] able to believe.
[57:39] that seed is not in you.
[57:42] The son of man came to seek and save
[57:46] them that were lost. They were lost
[57:49] because they are part of Jesus.
[57:52] They are part of him. Praise the Lord.
[57:55] So you are simply recognized
[57:58] that he speaks to you.
[58:01] So you know a metal
[58:03] &gt;&gt; and a wood
[58:05] when you bring a magnet
[58:07] &gt;&gt; and you put here a pieces of wood
[58:11] you put here pieces of metal pure metal
[58:14] the magnet
[58:16] &gt;&gt; will only look for a a nature that
[58:20] resembles his
[58:23] praise the Lord much as the woods may
[58:26] want to be attracted
[58:29] but because they not the nature of a
[58:31] magnet.
[58:33] They cannot be attracted to it
[58:37] because the magnet will not be able to
[58:39] seek it
[58:41] will not be able to recognize it. Praise
[58:44] the Lord. But the pieces of metal
[58:47] as they are being covered in swelise
[58:51] the Lord. When you place the magnet
[58:53] there, they will be able to organize the
[58:55] force.
[58:57] Praise the Lord. And somehow they make
[58:59] their way towards the magnet
[59:02] because the nature of the magnet
[59:05] has been organized by the nature
[59:08] that is in the metal. That's how we are
[59:11] born, brothers. Praise the Lord. When we
[59:14] are born, we have the seed of God in us.
[59:20] Praise the Lord. So when we hear the
[59:22] voice,
[59:24] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. We are men in those
[59:26] groups.
[59:28] We were many in the groups, many in the
[59:30] communities
[59:32] and we all heard this voice.
[59:35] It only took the life of God
[59:39] to recognize that voice.
[59:42] You know that oh there is a voice that
[59:46] is calling you and then you accepted the
[59:49] voice and you began to make your way
[59:52] towards the voice.
[59:55] We came to seek those that were lost. We
[59:59] had been lost and covered.
[1:00:02] We mentioned the teachings of the world.
[1:00:05] But when he brought his word,
[1:00:08] that word had to be recognized
[1:00:12] by the life that is in us. Praise the
[1:00:15] Lord. As I once said his brothers, Jesus
[1:00:19] said, "No man can come to me,
[1:00:23] except the father has drawn himself,
[1:00:26] there's no man that can come to me,
[1:00:30] except the father
[1:00:33] and he goes ahead to say there is no you
[1:00:36] can come to the father
[1:00:38] except you are known of him." Praise the
[1:00:41] Lord. So now when Jesus speaks, he's
[1:00:45] speaking to those that were a part of
[1:00:48] him as covenantal seed,
[1:00:52] a seed of promise that was elected
[1:00:56] before the foundation of the world.
[1:00:59] Praise the Lord. Now, no matter
[1:01:02] how far you could have gone,
[1:01:06] anyhow, when you hear the voice, when
[1:01:10] you hear the words, praise the Lord, you
[1:01:13] will make your way out.
[1:01:16] Praise the Lord. And remember, when
[1:01:18] these small metals are coming towards
[1:01:20] the magnet,
[1:01:22] they don't come by their force.
[1:01:25] It is the force of the magnet
[1:01:27] that pulls them towards
[1:01:30] when you come to Christ. It's not by
[1:01:33] your effort.
[1:01:35] It is God that gives you the grace
[1:01:38] to march towards him. Praise the Lord
[1:01:42] because you were a part of him. Praise
[1:01:45] the Lord. That's how we can look at
[1:01:46] ourselves
[1:01:48] that we are who we are because we are
[1:01:51] part of him. And if if you are part of
[1:01:54] him, Jesus said that there is no way you
[1:01:59] will ever get lost.
[1:02:01] Praise the Lord. Because when you came
[1:02:03] to him, it was not in your personal
[1:02:06] effort.
[1:02:07] But he gave you the grace.
[1:02:10] Praise the Lord. Much as his seat was
[1:02:12] there,
[1:02:14] he still gave you the grace to move
[1:02:17] towards.
[1:02:19] Praise the Lord. You have not chosen me.
[1:02:22] I have chosen you. Praise the Lord. So
[1:02:26] now he has chosen us to come here on
[1:02:29] earth that we may begin to manifest his
[1:02:34] attributes. Praise the Lord. My
[1:02:37] children, Sam's children, when they look
[1:02:40] at Sam's child, they will not say this
[1:02:42] is Wilson's child. No sir, because Sam's
[1:02:46] child has the attributes of his father
[1:02:49] son.
[1:02:51] Praise the Lord. The way he looks, the
[1:02:54] way he walks, it is all depicting some.
[1:02:58] So you can't say this is Wilson's child.
[1:03:00] No sir. Even if you told him that
[1:03:04] Gabriel,
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; your father is Wilson. You say no, my
[1:03:08] papa is Sam. Because by nature, Sam and
[1:03:13] Gabriel are connected.
[1:03:16] There is no way you can break that bone.
[1:03:20] nature by for knowledge the sons of God
[1:03:25] are connected to God.
[1:03:27] Praise the Lord. There is nothing that
[1:03:31] can wreck that relationship.
[1:03:34] There is nothing that can wreak that
[1:03:37] bond.
[1:03:38] Why? Because we were in him before the
[1:03:42] foundation of the world.
[1:03:44] So when we come here, the way the
[1:03:47] children manifest the attributes of
[1:03:50] their parents
[1:03:52] is the same way the sons and daughters
[1:03:54] of God
[1:03:56] are able to manifest the attributes of
[1:03:59] their fathers.
[1:04:01] Praise the Lord. And the prophet says in
[1:04:03] the message the invisal union of the
[1:04:05] bride
[1:04:07] preach 1965
[1:04:10] paragraph 59 says and a son
[1:04:14] is the attributes of his father.
[1:04:17] And just as you were in the genes of
[1:04:19] your father,
[1:04:21] in the body of your father when he was a
[1:04:24] young boy,
[1:04:26] you were in him. Yet he could not have
[1:04:30] fellowship with you
[1:04:32] because he didn't know you. But then
[1:04:35] through the bing grounds of a mother,
[1:04:39] you were brought forth into the earth
[1:04:42] and became in the image of your father.
[1:04:46] Then he could have fellowship with you.
[1:04:51] So were you sons of God and daughters of
[1:04:56] God before there were even was a moon.
[1:05:02] Friends, I want us to perceive this
[1:05:04] clear. I want us to see our positions
[1:05:09] in Christ. I want us to see our position
[1:05:12] that we existed in him
[1:05:16] before even the stars and the moons were
[1:05:18] created.
[1:05:21] So you are not here this afternoon by
[1:05:23] mistake.
[1:05:26] You are here because God predestinated
[1:05:28] you to be here.
[1:05:31] You are here because you are his son.
[1:05:34] You are his daughter.
[1:05:36] You are here because he knew you before
[1:05:40] you even existed.
[1:05:42] Praise the Lord. So you are able to
[1:05:45] overcome
[1:05:47] not because you have the ability
[1:05:50] but because the nature in you is the
[1:05:54] nature of victory. Because Christ
[1:05:56] overcame
[1:05:58] and he overcame for who?
[1:06:00] He ever came for you and me.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; So the nature that we have because he
[1:06:06] says according he has chosen us in him.
[1:06:10] So if he has chosen us in him and we are
[1:06:13] his children that means we have his
[1:06:16] nature.
[1:06:17] The nature of God is the nature of
[1:06:20] victory.
[1:06:21] Praise the Lord. And he says praise the
[1:06:24] Lord. And he says, "But then through the
[1:06:28] bedding grounds of a mother,
[1:06:31] you were brought forth into the earth
[1:06:33] and became in the image of your father.
[1:06:37] Then he could have fellowship with you.
[1:06:40] So you were sons and daughters of God
[1:06:44] before there were even a moon, stars, or
[1:06:46] a molecule.
[1:06:50] You were sons and daughters of God.
[1:06:54] For you are only the physical
[1:06:57] manifestation of the attributes that was
[1:07:00] in God.
[1:07:06] At the beginning,
[1:07:08] remember how God created man.
[1:07:11] Praise the Lord. He had created
[1:07:12] everything in the earth.
[1:07:15] Praise the Lord. But then I had created
[1:07:18] everything.
[1:07:20] He said, "But now I have created
[1:07:23] everything.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; But nothing have I am I able to have
[1:07:27] fellowship with.
[1:07:30] And how did God create? He created by
[1:07:33] the spoken word.
[1:07:35] Praise the Lord. He spoke things into
[1:07:37] existence."
[1:07:38] The brothers preached last Sunday that
[1:07:41] he was expressing his thought.
[1:07:44] He had a thought.
[1:07:46] Praise the Lord. And now some of us have
[1:07:49] been to school
[1:07:50] and now we studied
[1:07:53] uh fine art.
[1:07:56] Praise the Lord. So the teacher could
[1:07:58] come and tell you
[1:08:00] you are going to draw a port
[1:08:03] and that port should have these
[1:08:04] attributes.
[1:08:07] So now the only way you are able
[1:08:10] to draw this pot is when you have the
[1:08:13] pot in your mind.
[1:08:15] So you you begin to have the picture of
[1:08:17] the pot in your mind
[1:08:20] and how this port is going to look like.
[1:08:24] Praise the Lord. So that when you get a
[1:08:26] pencil and a paper,
[1:08:29] you begin to depict to display
[1:08:32] that which is in your mind.
[1:08:35] Every artist
[1:08:37] Praise the Lord. When they begin to put
[1:08:39] their pens on a paper,
[1:08:42] they are simply making a point a
[1:08:44] painting of that
[1:08:47] which is in their mind. They are
[1:08:50] expressing their soul.
[1:08:53] So God had his thoughts
[1:08:56] and those thoughts were already.
[1:09:00] Praise the Lord. They were typing who
[1:09:02] God is.
[1:09:04] Praise the Lord. Because when you hear
[1:09:06] me speaking, I am speaking myself. So if
[1:09:10] I am speaking myself, you say it is
[1:09:12] Wilson speaking.
[1:09:14] Because my voice cannot be separated
[1:09:17] from the person of me.
[1:09:20] Praise the Lord. When you hear my voice,
[1:09:22] you know it is me that is speaking. When
[1:09:24] you hear the brother, you know it is him
[1:09:27] that is speaking. So when he's speaking,
[1:09:30] he's speaking that which is which is in
[1:09:32] his throat.
[1:09:35] expressing his thoughts. So now in the
[1:09:38] beginning when God was creating, he
[1:09:41] created everything
[1:09:44] by the spoken word. Where did the spoken
[1:09:47] word come from?
[1:09:49] It had to come from God
[1:09:52] because it was a part of God. It was the
[1:09:55] thought of God being expressed. Praise
[1:09:59] the Lord. And when he spoke, whatever he
[1:10:02] spoke came into existence.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now when the Bible
[1:10:07] says we were in Christ, we were in him.
[1:10:12] That means we were a part of his
[1:10:15] thought.
[1:10:17] Praise the Lord. So time had to come and
[1:10:21] God wanted to have God wanted to have
[1:10:26] fellowship
[1:10:28] with the people with the children which
[1:10:32] he had thought of.
[1:10:35] When my time came I needed to have
[1:10:38] fellowship. I wanted to have a family so
[1:10:41] now I could get a wife and produce
[1:10:44] children
[1:10:46] and produce children. So the children
[1:10:48] that were in me are now no longer in me.
[1:10:53] They are now into the world being
[1:10:55] manifested as objects
[1:10:59] came from me. So I am able to look at
[1:11:02] them and have fellowship with them.
[1:11:06] That was my desire.
[1:11:09] That was the desire of God.
[1:11:12] And God said let us create man in our
[1:11:16] own image. So he created man and then he
[1:11:19] went ahead. Praise the Lord. When he got
[1:11:22] the ground to create this man to create
[1:11:26] this body which is governed by the five
[1:11:29] senses.
[1:11:31] Praise the Lord. Then he went ahead and
[1:11:34] he picked a part of him
[1:11:37] that was in him and he got mad and the
[1:11:41] Bible says and he breathed in his
[1:11:44] nostrils.
[1:11:46] So now God was speaking part of his own
[1:11:49] life
[1:11:51] and putting it into man. And the Bible
[1:11:54] says it was until that time
[1:11:58] that man became a living soul.
[1:12:02] When he had created him, he was simply
[1:12:05] an object
[1:12:06] until God picked a part of him and
[1:12:10] raised in this man. Then this man became
[1:12:14] a living soul.
[1:12:16] That means something had to come from
[1:12:18] God
[1:12:20] to bring life to man.
[1:12:22] That is the seed that God put in man.
[1:12:26] And that seed shall never get lost.
[1:12:29] That seed can never get lost.
[1:12:32] Because where does that seed live? It
[1:12:34] does not live in the on the in the body
[1:12:38] because this body is governed by the
[1:12:42] five senses. Praise the Lord. And then
[1:12:45] we have the soul inside of this body
[1:12:48] and it's also governed by senses of
[1:12:51] emotion.
[1:12:52] Praise the Lord. You have sensations in
[1:12:54] your soul.
[1:12:56] You are moved by emotions. You feel
[1:12:59] angry. Much as the body is not showing
[1:13:03] but you can get upset. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:06] But yet in that soul
[1:13:09] is the spirit and that spirit is the
[1:13:13] seed of God that came from God. So when
[1:13:18] God is coming, he speaks to your spirit
[1:13:22] because it is your spirit that
[1:13:24] identifies with him.
[1:13:27] That's why he says we are a part of him
[1:13:30] not this body because this body will rot
[1:13:35] and die but that spirit
[1:13:38] cannot die.
[1:13:41] Why? Because it is eternal.
[1:13:44] It is a seed of God and it is a seed of
[1:13:47] God and God is eternal. That seed can
[1:13:51] never die. That's why Jesus said, "I
[1:13:55] will raise them up
[1:13:57] to the last day." Why? Because that seed
[1:14:02] is totally eternal.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's who we are.
[1:14:07] That's who you are.
[1:14:10] You are the seed of God because in you
[1:14:13] is the spirit of God.
[1:14:15] The spirit of God is.
[1:14:18] Praise the Lord. That is a blessing.
[1:14:22] According he has chosen us. In him
[1:14:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:27] and says, "Therefore,
[1:14:31] as sure as your gene heart be in your
[1:14:34] father
[1:14:37] before your natural birth,
[1:14:39] your spiritual gene had be in God
[1:14:43] because you are an expression of the
[1:14:46] attributes of his thoughts.
[1:14:51] before the foundation of the world.
[1:14:54] Right? No way around it.
[1:14:58] That is right. Now we notice together
[1:15:01] then that that life
[1:15:04] being in you. God is life being in you
[1:15:08] from the foundation of the world.
[1:15:11] Praise the Lord. So when we come to this
[1:15:13] body, we are only coming to manifest his
[1:15:16] attributes.
[1:15:18] Praise the Lord. And now he again says
[1:15:21] here
[1:15:23] that what I mean
[1:15:26] attributes was his thoughts
[1:15:30] a word is a thought expressed
[1:15:33] and then that was in his thinking.
[1:15:38] And when he said
[1:15:41] let there be
[1:15:44] there was and let there be
[1:15:48] And there I was. And now remember you
[1:15:50] Christians
[1:15:52] were his thoughts before there was a
[1:15:54] world.
[1:15:57] Do you believe that?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And you are the
[1:16:01] manifestation of his thinking.
[1:16:06] Before there was even a world,
[1:16:09] you were in Christ,
[1:16:12] in God in the beginning. That makes you
[1:16:16] then you see his subjects.
[1:16:20] That makes you his subjects.
[1:16:23] And the whole thing is
[1:16:25] is God himself materializing himself
[1:16:30] tangible
[1:16:36] so he could be handled.
[1:16:39] When I touch him, I am able to feel God
[1:16:43] because him is is the expression of God
[1:16:47] because before he was God. Praise the
[1:16:50] Lord. He was simply an eternal being,
[1:16:54] an eternal being.
[1:16:56] Praise the Lord. He was simply
[1:16:58] selfexisting,
[1:17:01] eternal. And the Bible says he used to
[1:17:04] move upon the face of the waters.
[1:17:07] Praise the Lord. Because he had not yet
[1:17:09] created man
[1:17:11] to worship him to make him the object of
[1:17:14] worship.
[1:17:16] So he was simply an eternal being.
[1:17:19] So now his thoughts wanted to be
[1:17:22] expressed.
[1:17:24] He makes something tangible
[1:17:26] that would manifest his attribute.
[1:17:29] that tangible thing.
[1:17:32] Let us create man in our own image in
[1:17:36] the image of God. Created he man, male
[1:17:40] and female,
[1:17:43] created he them. And then God breathed
[1:17:47] his air.
[1:17:51] He gave a part of him
[1:17:54] in this man to manifest his attributes.
[1:17:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:00] and says so he could not be handled
[1:18:04] sin and so forth and that's what God is
[1:18:08] the whole thing praise the lord I would
[1:18:12] quote in uh Genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[1:18:16] I would quote James Genesis 126
[1:18:20] where God say let us create man our own
[1:18:22] image
[1:18:24] and after Genesis 1:26
[1:18:27] when we move Genesis 2:7.
[1:18:31] Now that's where God picked his spirit,
[1:18:35] his seat, and put in this box.
[1:18:39] Praise the Lord. And that seat
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; is the reason Jesus Christ came
[1:18:45] to climb it back. Praise the Lord.
[1:18:49] Because that seed had been lost in this
[1:18:52] body,
[1:18:53] in the lusts of the flesh, in the
[1:18:56] desires of the body, in the affairs of
[1:18:59] men. Praise the Lord. And when God saw
[1:19:02] it, he was not pleased. So he made his
[1:19:06] plan. And Jesus came. When Jesus came,
[1:19:11] he came to die to seek and find. Not we
[1:19:17] seek him. He never said I came so those
[1:19:21] that were part of me could seek me.
[1:19:25] He came to seek. It is God seeking.
[1:19:30] It is God looking for you. It is God
[1:19:32] locating you. So when you believe it is
[1:19:36] not your ability, it is not your own
[1:19:38] works. It is not your own power. It is
[1:19:42] God looking for you. because we are part
[1:19:46] of him before the foundation of the
[1:19:48] world
[1:19:50] raised the Lord. You notice that Adam
[1:19:53] did not tell God what form he should
[1:19:56] look like
[1:19:58] but God in his thought when he created
[1:20:02] him. He said Adam should be in my own
[1:20:06] image.
[1:20:08] It was God that chose
[1:20:11] not Adam that did the choosing.
[1:20:14] It is God that chose us and we did not
[1:20:17] choose him.
[1:20:20] Praise the Lord. And that's what it is.
[1:20:23] By election,
[1:20:25] God looks for his seeds.
[1:20:29] By election, he has sent his servants.
[1:20:34] He sent prophets.
[1:20:36] He sent so many of them. And then when
[1:20:39] they all failed,
[1:20:41] he had to send his own son
[1:20:45] because by election,
[1:20:47] God had children.
[1:20:50] By election,
[1:20:52] he had brought his children into
[1:20:54] manifestation
[1:20:56] and they were out there. I want to tell
[1:20:59] you brothers.
[1:21:00] Each one of us is able to believe,
[1:21:04] each one of us is able to obey.
[1:21:07] Each one of us Is he able to recognize
[1:21:10] the voice of God?
[1:21:13] One because there is a seed of God in
[1:21:15] the in in there.
[1:21:18] Two, God gives us the grace to believe
[1:21:22] his word. Praise the Lord. This same
[1:21:25] word is preached
[1:21:28] every day to the rest of the world. But
[1:21:31] how many are able
[1:21:34] to organize this word and know that this
[1:21:37] is the word of God?
[1:21:39] This is the truth. Only those that were
[1:21:43] known before the foundation of the
[1:21:46] world. So you being here is a proof that
[1:21:51] you were known.
[1:21:53] You were chosen in him before the
[1:21:56] foundation of the world. Because when
[1:21:59] you had a voice, you were able to hear
[1:22:03] and recognize it.
[1:22:07] God gave you grace to have faith. Where
[1:22:11] does faith sit?
[1:22:14] Faith sits in the spirit.
[1:22:17] It is the spirit that has faith. That's
[1:22:20] the only thing that governs the spirit.
[1:22:23] So when the word is being preached, this
[1:22:26] word goes direct to the spirit.
[1:22:30] So if the spirit of God is not in you,
[1:22:33] this will sound like any other thing
[1:22:35] that you do.
[1:22:37] Praise the Lord. But if the spirit of
[1:22:39] God is in you, you will be able to hear
[1:22:43] and know that this is speaking to you.
[1:22:46] Praise the Lord. Because in you is that
[1:22:50] seed
[1:22:51] is that seed. Yet that seed is still the
[1:22:55] word of God manifested.
[1:22:58] So when he speaks and you say amen, you
[1:23:02] said amen because the seed was there.
[1:23:07] Praise the Lord and it received life.
[1:23:11] And now the more you hear, the more this
[1:23:14] word begins to water.
[1:23:17] Praise the Lord. The seed was dormant
[1:23:20] before you had the word of God.
[1:23:24] Praise the Lord. There was no desire for
[1:23:26] salvation
[1:23:28] before you had the word of God. But when
[1:23:31] you had the word of God, you felt the
[1:23:33] desire for salvation.
[1:23:36] You felt the desire for repentance.
[1:23:39] Why? Because when the word lands on the
[1:23:41] fertile ground,
[1:23:44] the seed must bring forth life.
[1:23:47] So now when it landed in your heart, in
[1:23:50] your spirit, it gave it faith.
[1:23:54] It it rejuvenated that faith.
[1:23:57] Praise the Lord. Then it began to grow
[1:24:00] to grow until it bore the fruit
[1:24:05] of faith
[1:24:07] to believe. Praise the Lord that this is
[1:24:10] the truth. Not of your works, but
[1:24:14] because he chose you.
[1:24:16] Praise the Lord. Not because you were
[1:24:18] very attentive,
[1:24:21] but because you were known of him
[1:24:23] before the foundation of the world.
[1:24:26] Praise the Lord. So it is it is and he
[1:24:29] says, so now when we say obedience to
[1:24:33] the voice,
[1:24:36] what is obedience? It is simply a
[1:24:39] response,
[1:24:41] a response to the word.
[1:24:45] Simply responding
[1:24:47] to the word because you have the faith
[1:24:51] to believe the word. So when you begin
[1:24:53] to obey,
[1:24:55] simply responding
[1:24:58] to the word of God. Praise the Lord. So
[1:25:01] you begin acting
[1:25:03] according to the word.
[1:25:05] Praise the Lord. So now the seed that is
[1:25:08] in us,
[1:25:10] that seed must grow.
[1:25:13] That seed must grow.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; And like in the natural when they throw
[1:25:18] a seed
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; into the ground, praise the Lord. That
[1:25:24] seed may not grow
[1:25:26] if you don't water it. If it does not
[1:25:29] receive
[1:25:31] conducive environment,
[1:25:34] the seed will die.
[1:25:36] Praise the Lord. It must be watered. It
[1:25:40] must be given the right environment
[1:25:44] for it to grow. Unlike the seed
[1:25:48] in the ground, we are different because
[1:25:52] the seed that is in us,
[1:25:55] that seed can never die.
[1:25:57] Friends, the seed that you have
[1:26:01] in the first place, you've not received
[1:26:04] it today.
[1:26:06] No sir, you didn't receive it when you
[1:26:08] believed.
[1:26:10] No sir, that seed was already there
[1:26:14] before the foundation of the world.
[1:26:17] So that seed can never die.
[1:26:20] It is eternal. All it needs is to grow
[1:26:25] and manifest the attributes of the
[1:26:27] father.
[1:26:29] It needs the word of God because the
[1:26:32] spirit feeds on the word.
[1:26:35] That's why when you heard the word,
[1:26:38] you received energy to believe.
[1:26:41] You noticed that this
[1:26:44] is something that is speaking about God.
[1:26:47] But before you heard the word, it was
[1:26:49] business as usual.
[1:26:52] But when you hear this word, there is no
[1:26:55] way you can settle down there
[1:26:59] because
[1:27:01] the deep was called the deep
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; and the deep has to respond
[1:27:09] and he said, "Father,
[1:27:11] forgive me. Forgive me. I am sorry for
[1:27:16] all the things I've committed."
[1:27:18] And as you are crying,
[1:27:21] it is the deep calling. The magnet is
[1:27:24] attractive.
[1:27:26] As you are crying and now you have
[1:27:28] things that you hold dear to yourself.
[1:27:31] And then you hear the word and say,
[1:27:33] "Thou shalt not do this." And says,
[1:27:36] "Father, I'm sorry. I have been doing
[1:27:39] this without my knowledge.
[1:27:41] You are coming until you come out and
[1:27:45] you get the magnet."
[1:27:47] And the moment you get there by way of
[1:27:51] the new birth,
[1:27:53] praise the Lord, there is no way you can
[1:27:57] ever get lost.
[1:28:00] Praise the Lord. We are the covenantal
[1:28:03] seed,
[1:28:05] chosen by election
[1:28:08] before the foundation of the world.
[1:28:10] Praise the living God. and Luke when
[1:28:13] Jesus came he says I have come to look
[1:28:17] for you
[1:28:19] Luke 19:2
[1:28:22] and Jesus entered and passed through
[1:28:24] Jericho
[1:28:32] and Jesus entered and passed through
[1:28:35] Jericho
[1:28:39] 192
[1:28:44] It's okay. You can read.
[1:28:48] So you can read that. Okay.
[1:28:59] And he was sold to see Jesus. He and and
[1:29:03] he saw to see Jesus who he was and could
[1:29:06] not for the for the press, but he was
[1:29:08] little of stature.
[1:29:20] And he ran before and climbed up into a
[1:29:22] psycho tree to see him. And for he was
[1:29:27] to pass that way.
[1:29:36] He had
[1:29:39] Zakias had a desire.
[1:29:43] He had heard that Jesus was going to
[1:29:45] pass that way.
[1:29:47] And when he had a news,
[1:29:50] that news spoke his heart
[1:29:53] because in there was a seat.
[1:29:56] So he ran up there.
[1:29:59] He was a short man.
[1:30:02] So he could not see Jesus. But because
[1:30:05] of the desire in him.
[1:30:07] The deep was called into the deep.
[1:30:10] So he looked for how possible
[1:30:14] to see Jesus.
[1:30:16] And the Bible says, "And when Jesus came
[1:30:18] to the place, he looked up and saw him
[1:30:22] and said unto him, Zakius, make haste
[1:30:25] and come down, for today I must abide at
[1:30:28] thy house.
[1:30:40] Because you have heard, you've expressed
[1:30:43] the desire.
[1:30:45] Today I must pass your way.
[1:30:49] Praise the Lord. That is his our desire.
[1:30:53] That was the desire of Zakas
[1:30:56] that he could see him. For him, his
[1:30:58] desire was to simply see him.
[1:31:02] And yet Christ, praise the Lord, had
[1:31:05] Zakayas in his mind before the
[1:31:06] foundation of the world.
[1:31:09] So when he passed that way, he knew
[1:31:12] there would be Zakayas
[1:31:14] with a desire to receive him. That's all
[1:31:17] God requires of us to simply express our
[1:31:20] desire
[1:31:22] and says because you have expressed your
[1:31:24] desire,
[1:31:26] today I will pass by your way.
[1:31:30] today I will abide with you
[1:31:33] and he made haste
[1:31:36] and came down and received him joyfully
[1:31:40] and when they saw it the rest of the
[1:31:43] people you see the world does not want
[1:31:47] to lose you the world does not want to
[1:31:50] lose us praise the Lord so when you hear
[1:31:53] Jesus coming your way
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; and then you recognize
[1:31:58] that he is passing by. When he express
[1:32:02] your desire for him to come and abide
[1:32:05] with you, when he surely comes to call
[1:32:08] you out, the world does not want to lose
[1:32:11] you. So the world will begin to throw
[1:32:14] things against you.
[1:32:17] Praise the Lord to bring down your
[1:32:19] desire.
[1:32:21] Praise the Lord. But hold fast.
[1:32:25] It is in the right direction.
[1:32:28] It is in the right place that you are
[1:32:30] being called untrue.
[1:32:33] They said
[1:32:36] they began to mama saying verse seven
[1:32:40] that he was going to to be guest with a
[1:32:43] man that is a sinner.
[1:32:53] And Zakias,
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; he never said he was wasn't a sinner.
[1:32:58] His desire was to see Jesus.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He never wanted to
[1:33:04] prove to anyone
[1:33:06] how good he was. He only wanted to
[1:33:09] receive Jesus
[1:33:11] because in him was the seed of God. Our
[1:33:15] desire is to see Jesus is not be good
[1:33:20] or better than anyone. Your desire as a
[1:33:23] Christian
[1:33:25] is to receive Jesus in your name.
[1:33:28] Praise the Lord. And Jesus when we
[1:33:31] express our desire,
[1:33:33] he will pass by.
[1:33:36] And stood and said unto the unto the
[1:33:40] unto the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of my
[1:33:44] goods I give to the poor. And if I have
[1:33:46] taken anything from any man by false
[1:33:48] accusation, I restore I restore him for
[1:33:52] fault.
[1:34:12] a repentant heart.
[1:34:15] Praise the Lord. He was trying to say
[1:34:17] no, you calling me a sinner. But now
[1:34:21] look, God, this is my desire. All I want
[1:34:24] is to be with you.
[1:34:27] Praise the Lord. And says, if I have
[1:34:28] done anything wrong, I am sorry.
[1:34:32] Jesus smiled and said, "That's not what
[1:34:34] I'm looking for.
[1:34:37] I have found you because the son of man
[1:34:41] came to look for you who was lost. And
[1:34:44] now that I have found you, Zakiah,
[1:34:47] that is my desire." Praise the Lord.
[1:34:50] Yes, repent.
[1:34:52] Praise the Lord. But my interest is the
[1:34:54] seed.
[1:34:56] Praise the Lord. is to perfect the seed
[1:34:58] that is in there which was a part of him
[1:35:01] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:04] for the son of man
[1:35:07] is come to seek and save that which was
[1:35:12] lost. Therefore Jesus said unto him,
[1:35:16] "This day is salvation, come to this
[1:35:18] house,
[1:35:23] for so much as he also is a son of
[1:35:27] Abraham."
[1:35:30] Zakius
[1:35:31] was in Abraham
[1:35:34] more than 2,000 years ago,
[1:35:38] but Jesus was able to see him.
[1:35:42] Praise the Lord that he was in Abraham.
[1:35:46] Abraham could not did not see Zakayas.
[1:35:50] Praise the Lord. But yet Zakayas existed
[1:35:53] in him. And now here was the
[1:35:56] manifestation of the seed of Abraham.
[1:35:59] Praise the Lord. We were in God. Praise
[1:36:03] the Lord. And now here we are simply
[1:36:05] manifestation
[1:36:08] of that which was in him.
[1:36:11] Friends, how do you look at yourself
[1:36:13] today?
[1:36:15] Don't look at yourself as a failure.
[1:36:18] Don't look at yourself as a sinner.
[1:36:21] Look at yourself as a son and daughter
[1:36:24] of God
[1:36:26] that existed in God
[1:36:29] before the foundation of the world. So
[1:36:32] if you existed,
[1:36:34] why call yourself a sinner?
[1:36:36] Praise the Lord. You are holy because he
[1:36:40] that is in you is holy.
[1:36:44] Praise the Lord. You've overcome the
[1:36:46] world because he that is in you is
[1:36:50] greater than he that is in the world.
[1:36:55] The son of man simply came to seek for
[1:36:58] you and to entrust you with his power,
[1:37:03] entrust you with his authority.
[1:37:05] Because Jesus said that you see the
[1:37:08] things I have done, I am simply
[1:37:10] manifesting the attributes of my father.
[1:37:14] Praise the Lord. He walked on the water.
[1:37:17] He raised the dead. He healed the sick.
[1:37:20] And yet he said, "Greater things than
[1:37:23] this
[1:37:24] shall you do." Why? Because the power
[1:37:30] with which I have to make these miracles
[1:37:34] is the same power that rests in you.
[1:37:39] Praise the Lord. So now if we could look
[1:37:41] at ourselves
[1:37:43] as sons and daughters of God, praise the
[1:37:47] Lord. We shall have the courage to pick
[1:37:50] up when we fail
[1:37:53] because we know that the victory that we
[1:37:56] have
[1:37:57] is but not ours.
[1:38:00] It was already done for us
[1:38:04] God already ordered your way. He already
[1:38:07] ordered your path.
[1:38:09] All we got to do is to be patient with
[1:38:11] him.
[1:38:13] Praise the Lord. And he says here in the
[1:38:17] book of John 6:35,
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said unto them, I am the bread
[1:38:24] of life. He that cometh to me shall
[1:38:28] never hunger, and he that believeth on
[1:38:30] me shall never thirst.
[1:38:43] But I said unto you that you also have
[1:38:47] seen me and believe not.
[1:38:53] Praise the Lord. They had seen him yet
[1:38:57] they had not believed him. Why? All that
[1:39:00] the father giveth me shall come to me.
[1:39:06] And him that cometh to me, I will not in
[1:39:10] no wise cast out.
[1:39:15] That's the secret of salvation.
[1:39:18] Praise the Lord. Jesus, God makes him a
[1:39:21] go between.
[1:39:24] God makes him a go between.
[1:39:28] Praise the Lord. God locates each one of
[1:39:31] us
[1:39:32] and brings us close to him to hear the
[1:39:36] word, believe the word by Jesus Christ.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord because the Bible says
[1:39:44] the faith that we have
[1:39:46] comes to us by hearing
[1:39:49] and hearing
[1:39:51] by the word of God.
[1:39:54] So you hear the word of God and by the
[1:39:57] word of God you receive faith to
[1:40:00] believe.
[1:40:02] Jesus said you have heard me yet you do
[1:40:06] not believe.
[1:40:08] Why? Because the father has not known
[1:40:11] you.
[1:40:12] But those who the father knew he will
[1:40:16] bring them to me.
[1:40:19] How? When they hear the word
[1:40:22] they will believe it.
[1:40:24] It is a finished work. It is a work that
[1:40:27] was done for you to believe. It is a
[1:40:31] work that was already done for you to
[1:40:32] believe.
[1:40:36] So when you you hear the word,
[1:40:39] you believe because God ordained you to
[1:40:43] believe.
[1:40:45] Blessed be the God and father
[1:40:48] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. who has begotten us in
[1:40:54] him
[1:40:56] before the foundation of the world
[1:40:58] and he has predestated us
[1:41:01] and to the adoption of children.
[1:41:05] You see in the Old Testament when a
[1:41:08] father produced a son
[1:41:11] by birth this son belongs to the father.
[1:41:15] Praise the Lord by birth. The child has
[1:41:18] a right to be part of the father. And
[1:41:20] now the father brought this son and took
[1:41:25] this son to a family to be adopted.
[1:41:29] Praise the Lord. And so this child had
[1:41:32] to be mentored.
[1:41:34] And now until that child
[1:41:38] is fully matured
[1:41:41] that he has the attributes of the father
[1:41:44] and he has the capacity
[1:41:46] to hold his possessions.
[1:41:49] That's when he was brought back.
[1:41:51] And now when he when he was fully
[1:41:53] tutoed,
[1:41:55] taught by the one who adopted,
[1:41:59] instructed,
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord and brought up well.
[1:42:04] Then when he was brought the father, he
[1:42:07] was adopted back to the family.
[1:42:10] He was adopted
[1:42:12] to have ownership to have the rights
[1:42:15] over the possession of his father.
[1:42:18] Not until he'd been tutored.
[1:42:21] There is no way he could be adopted
[1:42:25] into the family. We are sons of God by
[1:42:30] birth. Praise the Lord because it is him
[1:42:33] who begotten us who begot us before the
[1:42:36] foundation of the world.
[1:42:39] But then when we are born into the
[1:42:41] world, we have to be adopted
[1:42:45] back to the family by Jesus Christ.
[1:42:48] That's why he says unless my father
[1:42:52] gives you to me to adopt you into his
[1:42:55] family
[1:42:57] there is no way you can come to me. But
[1:43:00] we are so blessed that God he begot us
[1:43:06] and he begot us.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And when he begot us,
[1:43:11] he got us and gave us over to Jesus
[1:43:15] to tutor us to nurture us. Praise the
[1:43:19] Lord. And when we are ready by the new
[1:43:22] birth, we adopted back
[1:43:26] into the family to have possession.
[1:43:29] That's why
[1:43:31] he has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:43:34] blessings,
[1:43:36] all the blessings that we have.
[1:43:39] Even those that you've not thought
[1:43:40] about,
[1:43:42] they are all ours
[1:43:44] because we have the first
[1:43:47] receive them.
[1:43:50] Praise the Lord. He has begotten us and
[1:43:53] he has given us all those spiritual
[1:43:54] blessings.
[1:43:56] Amen. Amen. And now he says,
[1:44:00] for I came down from heaven.
[1:44:05] Can you give a sound?
[1:44:13] Amen. I came down from heaven
[1:44:16] not to do my own will
[1:44:19] but the will of him that sent me.
[1:44:23] And this is the father's will which has
[1:44:26] sent me that all o that all of which he
[1:44:31] has given me
[1:44:34] adoption.
[1:44:36] He got us and he gave us Christ. Praise
[1:44:40] the Lord. He got you in whatever
[1:44:43] condition of life. Even right now in
[1:44:45] whatever condition of lives you are in,
[1:44:49] God gave us over at Christ to tutor us
[1:44:54] to adopt us into his family.
[1:44:57] He says, "And this is the Father's will,
[1:45:01] which he has sent me, that of all which
[1:45:05] he has given me,
[1:45:08] I should lose nothing,
[1:45:11] but should raise it up again at the last
[1:45:13] day.
[1:45:15] Praise the Lord. And this is the will of
[1:45:17] him that sent me, that everyone
[1:45:21] which seeth the Son and believeth on him
[1:45:25] may have everlasting life, and I will
[1:45:28] raise him up on the last day. And no man
[1:45:31] can come to me except the father which
[1:45:35] sent me draw him.
[1:45:39] No man can come to me. There is no way
[1:45:43] you can come to Jesus.
[1:45:45] There is no you can believe Jesus except
[1:45:48] God.
[1:45:50] Who sent Jesus
[1:45:53] to redeem us to tutor us except God has
[1:45:58] drawn you to him
[1:46:00] and it has to be by predestination.
[1:46:04] It has to be by election. You must have
[1:46:07] been a part of him
[1:46:09] before he can draw you back to himself.
[1:46:13] No man can come to me except the father
[1:46:16] which sent me draw him and I raise him
[1:46:18] up at the last day. And he says it is
[1:46:22] written in the prophets
[1:46:24] that they shall be all taught of God.
[1:46:29] And every man therefore that has had and
[1:46:33] has learn of the father comes to me.
[1:46:44] Every man that has heard of the father.
[1:46:49] Praise the Lord. Oh, have you heard?
[1:46:53] Have you recognized
[1:46:55] this word? Have you heard a word? Do you
[1:46:59] recognize that it is coming from God?
[1:47:02] Have you recognized your father? Do you
[1:47:05] believe that you have been restored
[1:47:07] Jesus Christ? He says, "Every man that
[1:47:09] hears
[1:47:11] and learns of the father."
[1:47:14] So it begins with God
[1:47:16] and it has to end with God.
[1:47:19] Every man that has heard of the father
[1:47:23] and learn of him. That means it has to
[1:47:26] be God
[1:47:28] to teach you. He says there's no you can
[1:47:31] come to me even the very first day that
[1:47:36] you feel you believed.
[1:47:39] He said God was there teaching you.
[1:47:42] God was there all through the way. Even
[1:47:45] when you are still in the denominations,
[1:47:48] God was there with you.
[1:47:52] He was there teaching you.
[1:47:54] Praise the Lord. Because you are his
[1:47:58] seat and you are his seat and his seat
[1:48:02] can never be lost.
[1:48:05] So while you were down there,
[1:48:07] he still thought about you. He still
[1:48:10] thought about you. We were in his mind.
[1:48:14] Praise the Lord. You think about it,
[1:48:16] friends. Look at wherever we have come
[1:48:18] from.
[1:48:20] God was there with us.
[1:48:22] He was there speaking to us
[1:48:26] until when you heard the voice
[1:48:30] coming from inside
[1:48:33] and it spoke to you that this that
[1:48:35] you've heard is of God.
[1:48:39] Then you believed and you came. No man
[1:48:43] can come to me except the father draws
[1:48:46] him to me. But before the father draws
[1:48:49] him to me, no man can come except he has
[1:48:53] heard of the father and he has learned
[1:48:56] of the father.
[1:48:58] Then the father brings him to me to be
[1:49:01] tutored. There is no you can be brought
[1:49:03] to Christ to be tutoed
[1:49:06] unless you a part of god
[1:49:11] and Jesus Christ is the word of god.
[1:49:16] So you cannot come to the word
[1:49:18] unless God has drawn you.
[1:49:22] And God cannot draw you unless you were
[1:49:26] a part of him before the foundation of
[1:49:29] the world.
[1:49:30] Not any man has seen the father save he
[1:49:35] which is of God.
[1:49:38] No man has seen the father except that
[1:49:42] man is of the father.
[1:49:46] So you have seen, you have heard
[1:49:50] because you are of the father
[1:49:54] because the father knew you.
[1:49:57] Praise the Lord. That's our position in
[1:49:59] Christ. It is entirely determined of
[1:50:02] God.
[1:50:04] So we do not choose to be identified
[1:50:06] with God.
[1:50:08] But God does.
[1:50:10] Praise the Lord. You know how the
[1:50:13] children of Jesse,
[1:50:15] how Samuel was uh picking a king out of
[1:50:18] them.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; You see Jesse had children
[1:50:23] and now he brought the seven to the
[1:50:25] front
[1:50:27] and then the very first one he thought
[1:50:31] would be the choice of God.
[1:50:34] But that was not his choice.
[1:50:37] God had already chosen David
[1:50:40] to be king over Israel
[1:50:43] even before the foundation of the world.
[1:50:47] And now David was a reject
[1:50:53] he was looking after ship.
[1:50:56] And so when they ordered Jesse to bring
[1:50:59] his to be anointed,
[1:51:02] he never thought about David.
[1:51:06] So he brought these ones and the first
[1:51:09] were a giant.
[1:51:12] And even Samuel was convinced
[1:51:15] that this is the choice of God.
[1:51:18] And God spoke to Samuel and said, "No,
[1:51:21] do not anoint him.
[1:51:25] Him is not he that have chosen."
[1:51:28] They brought a second and all of them.
[1:51:32] And God had not accepted them because
[1:51:35] God had already elected someone
[1:51:39] to be. He had already elected someone
[1:51:43] by forn knowledge to be king over
[1:51:46] Israel.
[1:51:47] And Samuel so that they were all over.
[1:51:52] But he said he said there any other one
[1:51:55] left?
[1:51:56] Then was like but the one who is left he
[1:51:59] even smells sheep.
[1:52:03] He's always in the bush.
[1:52:05] He's not worthy to be brought close and
[1:52:08] says it is he who God has chosen to be
[1:52:13] king over Israel. The choice of God is
[1:52:17] not the choice of man.
[1:52:20] It is not dictated by who
[1:52:24] is not dictated by who we are.
[1:52:28] Is not dictated by how you look like.
[1:52:31] It is not dictated by what you have
[1:52:34] done.
[1:52:36] But it is what God has chosen.
[1:52:41] It's not what you have done, brother.
[1:52:44] It's not what I have done
[1:52:46] for God to choose us. But because he
[1:52:49] chose us in him before the foundation of
[1:52:52] the world.
[1:52:55] So you are here today
[1:52:58] because you are God's perfect choice.
[1:53:02] You are here because you are his seed
[1:53:06] by election.
[1:53:08] There is nothing man can do
[1:53:11] to deserve salvation.
[1:53:14] Doing good is just fine.
[1:53:18] But God has not chosen you
[1:53:21] based on your good works.
[1:53:23] He's chosen you because he already chose
[1:53:27] you
[1:53:29] before the foundation of the world.
[1:53:32] He knew you and chose you to be adopted
[1:53:37] and the children of promise.
[1:53:39] Ephesians 2:10,
[1:53:43] by grace are you saved through faith,
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; and that not of yourselves. It is the
[1:53:51] gift of God.
[1:53:57] So you can start from eight.
[1:54:05] So
[1:54:10] you are saved by grace.
[1:54:14] He chose you by his own grace.
[1:54:18] He chose you by his own love
[1:54:22] because he loved you as his children
[1:54:25] and he's not ready to lose each one of
[1:54:27] us.
[1:54:30] That's how he chose us.
[1:54:32] Not because we were good-looking.
[1:54:35] No, David wasn't good-looking,
[1:54:39] but he was God's perfect choice.
[1:54:44] His father could not see the attributes
[1:54:47] of God in him.
[1:54:50] Yet in him were the attributes of a
[1:54:52] warrior,
[1:54:55] an overcomer.
[1:54:57] But because was a small boy,
[1:55:00] his father could not see those
[1:55:02] attributes.
[1:55:04] And yet God saw his own attributes in
[1:55:07] David.
[1:55:12] Because David had been chosen.
[1:55:16] God has not chosen us
[1:55:19] based on anything.
[1:55:23] He has chosen us because he loved us and
[1:55:27] he already chose us in him before the
[1:55:30] foundation of the world.
[1:55:33] He says not of works
[1:55:38] lest any man should boast.
[1:55:41] You would say, "Oh, I fasted and prayed.
[1:55:44] I saw the face of God. I had to pray for
[1:55:48] 30 days and fasted
[1:55:50] and then I found God."
[1:55:54] You can't boast.
[1:55:57] He just chose you because he loved you.
[1:56:02] For we are his workmanship.
[1:56:08] That's why he chose you.
[1:56:11] created in Christ Jesus
[1:56:15] unto good works
[1:56:18] which God has before ordained
[1:56:24] that we should walk in them
[1:56:26] before you even are
[1:56:29] God ordained
[1:56:32] how you should walk
[1:56:35] it's not by mistake
[1:56:39] what your path has been.
[1:56:42] It is all God.
[1:56:45] God has ordained our parts
[1:56:48] even before we were into existence
[1:56:52] because he said we are his workmanship
[1:56:56] created in Christ Jesus unto good works.
[1:57:01] So you can't boast of your good works.
[1:57:04] No, it has to be the grace of God.
[1:57:09] By grace, by grace are you saved.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Ephesians
[1:57:22] 1:1 has told us
[1:57:28] according as he has chosen us.
[1:57:32] Verse two,
[1:57:34] grace be to you
[1:57:37] and peace. from God our father
[1:57:41] and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the God
[1:57:47] and attribute.
[1:57:50] Paul was worshiping.
[1:57:52] He was magnifying God. The spirit of God
[1:57:56] was upon him.
[1:57:58] He said, "Blessed be the God and father
[1:58:02] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:04] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:58:07] blessings in heaven places in Christ
[1:58:12] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:58:16] by grace. He has chosen us by grace. you
[1:58:21] are saved before the foundation of the
[1:58:23] world
[1:58:26] that you are going to be holy
[1:58:29] and without blame.
[1:58:31] The world may see like
[1:58:35] a sinner yet God
[1:58:38] sees one that is holy
[1:58:41] because he has ordained you to be holy
[1:58:44] and it is his duty
[1:58:47] to make you holy.
[1:58:50] God will make you holy.
[1:58:53] God will help you overcome.
[1:58:56] God will help you overcome every
[1:58:57] challenge,
[1:58:59] every weakness.
[1:59:02] Why? Because when he came, his Bible
[1:59:05] says he has to create out of us a church
[1:59:10] that has no spot or wrinkle.
[1:59:14] That church is not coming from the
[1:59:16] angels.
[1:59:18] That church is you and me.
[1:59:23] Regardless of your weaknesses,
[1:59:25] God says he's creating out of you a
[1:59:28] church
[1:59:30] that has no spot or wrinkle.
[1:59:34] It is his duty to create that church out
[1:59:37] of you
[1:59:40] because he has chosen you in him before
[1:59:43] the foundation of the world
[1:59:45] and given you the grace
[1:59:48] to be saved,
[1:59:50] to be a son of God, to be a daughter of
[1:59:54] God.
[1:59:57] That's what it is.
[1:59:59] Not of our works, not our abilities,
[2:00:04] but because
[2:00:06] he has chosen us.
[2:00:09] 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 7.
[2:00:14] For God has not given us the spirit of
[2:00:16] fear.
[2:00:20] For God has not given us the spirit of
[2:00:21] fear, but of power and of love and of
[2:00:24] sound mind.
[2:00:33] Be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[2:00:36] testimony of our Lord,
[2:00:42] nor of me his prisoner,
[2:00:49] but be thou partaker of the afflictions
[2:00:51] of the gospel according to the power of
[2:00:53] God.
[2:01:07] Who has saved us
[2:01:12] and called us
[2:01:14] with unholy calling?
[2:01:17] Not according to our works,
[2:01:22] but according to his own purpose and
[2:01:25] grace.
[2:01:29] which was given in Christ Jesus
[2:01:34] before the world began.
[2:01:39] Recognizing your position,
[2:01:42] that's where we are
[2:01:44] in Christ.
[2:01:47] We were saved.
[2:01:49] And God called us with unholy calling
[2:01:54] to be holy without spot or wrinkle, not
[2:01:59] according to our works of righteousness,
[2:02:04] but according to his own purpose
[2:02:07] and grace
[2:02:09] which was given us.
[2:02:12] So he gave us the grace to be saved.
[2:02:16] He gave us the grace to be sons of God.
[2:02:19] and daughters of God
[2:02:23] in Christ before the world began.
[2:02:29] So where is your victory?
[2:02:33] Your victory was in Christ
[2:02:36] before even the world began.
[2:02:39] That's how we can see ourselves as
[2:02:41] Christians.
[2:02:45] We are a finished work.
[2:02:49] We are a finished work.
[2:02:52] Even before the world began,
[2:02:56] you had overcome.
[2:02:58] Even before the world began,
[2:03:01] you had a power to overcome.
[2:03:04] You had a grace to overcome.
[2:03:07] He chose us
[2:03:10] unconditionally.
[2:03:14] He he said, "Not of your works.
[2:03:17] He chose you unconditionally.
[2:03:21] My son,
[2:03:24] I didn't choose him to be my son because
[2:03:25] he did something
[2:03:29] unconditionally. He's my son.
[2:03:33] You are a son and daughter of God.
[2:03:36] Not because there is any condition in
[2:03:38] there.
[2:03:40] No, unconditionally because you are his
[2:03:43] seed.
[2:03:48] When he chose Israel,
[2:03:50] he never chose them because they were
[2:03:53] good people.
[2:03:55] We know how Israel was
[2:03:58] stiffnecked people,
[2:04:02] very hard.
[2:04:04] God does something today, then tomorrow
[2:04:07] they forget and complain. But yet God
[2:04:11] chose them and he called him his people.
[2:04:16] And he told them in Deuteronomy 7 verse
[2:04:21] 6,
[2:04:24] for thou art unholy people unto the Lord
[2:04:26] thy God.
[2:04:28] The Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a
[2:04:32] special people unto himself.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Above all people that are upon the face
[2:04:37] of the earth.
[2:04:59] The Lord God has chosen you to be a
[2:05:02] special people.
[2:05:06] You have not chosen him
[2:05:09] above all people that are upon the face
[2:05:10] of the earth.
[2:05:13] And it says, "The Lord did not set his
[2:05:15] love upon you,
[2:05:19] nor choose you
[2:05:22] because you were in you were more in
[2:05:24] number than any people,
[2:05:29] for you were the fewest.
[2:05:33] But because the Lord loved you,
[2:05:38] because he would keep the oath which he
[2:05:40] had swn unto your fathers, Has
[2:05:47] the Lord brought you out with a mighty
[2:05:48] hand?
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Verse N. Know therefore that the Lord
[2:05:55] thy God, he is God,
[2:06:01] the faithful God,
[2:06:03] which keepeth covenant and mercy
[2:06:10] with them that love him,
[2:06:13] and keep his commandments to a thousand
[2:06:16] generations.
[2:06:23] How do you love him?
[2:06:25] Because he first loved you.
[2:06:28] Not of your works,
[2:06:31] not your abilities.
[2:06:34] He loved us because we were in him
[2:06:39] before the foundation of the world.
[2:06:42] You love your children, you fathers
[2:06:45] with no condition
[2:06:47] because those children were in you
[2:06:51] before they existed.
[2:06:53] It's unconditional love.
[2:06:58] He said, "I loved you."
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Not because you did so great things,
[2:07:05] but because he has chosen you to be his
[2:07:07] special people
[2:07:10] special because there is a special thing
[2:07:12] in you
[2:07:15] which identifies you with God.
[2:07:19] That thing identifies you with God.
[2:07:23] That is the life of God in you.
[2:07:26] That is the spirit of God in you. His
[2:07:29] seed
[2:07:31] which he created before the foundation
[2:07:33] of the world.
[2:07:36] Praise the Lord. I have made you a
[2:07:38] special people.
[2:07:41] Praise the Lord. That's what God does
[2:07:45] according as he has chosen us in him
[2:07:49] before the foundation of the world.
[2:07:52] And the prophet quotes I quote him in
[2:07:55] the message the believer's position in
[2:07:56] Christ
[2:07:58] the believer's position in Christ.
[2:08:01] Now if we can find our position
[2:08:05] and know that it is God's word that has
[2:08:08] promised it.
[2:08:12] If we as believers
[2:08:16] in our weaknesses,
[2:08:18] in our points of failures
[2:08:21] can recognize our position
[2:08:25] and know that it is God's word that has
[2:08:28] promised that position to us.
[2:08:33] He says that's the reason Joshua and
[2:08:35] Caleb
[2:08:37] had no fear
[2:08:39] that they could take the promised land.
[2:08:44] because they had been promised.
[2:08:47] It is God who gave a promise.
[2:08:51] It is God who has said,
[2:08:54] "I have called you. I have chosen you.
[2:08:58] You have not chosen me."
[2:09:01] It is God who has said
[2:09:05] all that he has brought Christ,
[2:09:10] all them that he has called Christ,
[2:09:13] he shall lose none.
[2:09:16] Why do you get worried?
[2:09:20] You will make it, brother.
[2:09:23] We shall all make it.
[2:09:25] Not because you have the ability to make
[2:09:27] it,
[2:09:29] but because God has ordained it,
[2:09:34] it's a finished work.
[2:09:36] Not our abilities.
[2:09:39] Cuz he chose us.
[2:09:41] He just chose us.
[2:09:45] Joshua and Calb,
[2:09:48] they don't look at what the rest of the
[2:09:50] people said.
[2:09:52] They had a promise.
[2:09:54] They believed the promise
[2:09:57] and God gave them grace
[2:10:02] to execute the promise.
[2:10:05] That's all we we pray for that God may
[2:10:08] give us the grace to understand him in
[2:10:12] every situation
[2:10:17] to understand him.
[2:10:19] The prophet says in some message, the
[2:10:22] greatest battle ever fought
[2:10:26] that when he locates you
[2:10:29] and you recognize him,
[2:10:32] you come to a battle.
[2:10:36] You come to a battlefield.
[2:10:39] But even in the battlefield,
[2:10:41] you simply have to him
[2:10:46] that he is the war captain.
[2:10:51] That's what he said to Moses.
[2:10:54] Just lift up your hands.
[2:10:57] Keep them up.
[2:10:59] Moses did not know the magic,
[2:11:02] but he recognized
[2:11:05] the voice
[2:11:07] and he believed it and he did it. Each
[2:11:10] time his hands were up,
[2:11:13] Israel prevailed.
[2:11:17] Just recognize God
[2:11:20] in every one of our situations.
[2:11:23] Just recognize our positions,
[2:11:26] who we are in him.
[2:11:29] And that settles it.
[2:11:31] There will be no worries.
[2:11:34] Oh brother, I don't know whether I'll
[2:11:36] make it. Oh sister, I don't know whether
[2:11:39] I'll make it.
[2:11:41] you are making it
[2:11:43] is not determined by who you are.
[2:11:48] It was predestinated
[2:11:50] before the foundation of the world.
[2:11:54] And he says,
[2:11:56] you can't look at this sense of
[2:11:58] reasoning.
[2:12:00] You've got to look at the promise of
[2:12:02] God.
[2:12:04] Sometimes situations take us to a moment
[2:12:07] of reasoning.
[2:12:09] I'm like, but surely am I a daughter or
[2:12:11] a son of God?
[2:12:14] You are a daughter and son of God.
[2:12:20] He says, don't look at that sense.
[2:12:23] God had already sent his angel and the
[2:12:27] angel was in the camp moving with the
[2:12:29] children of Israel
[2:12:32] and the revelation of God had brought
[2:12:34] the word of God manifested.
[2:12:38] And now they was ready to push into the
[2:12:41] promised land.
[2:12:44] Grace unto you and peace from God our
[2:12:49] father
[2:12:51] from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:12:54] He says he's given his salute
[2:12:57] all his salutation to the church.
[2:13:00] Blessed be the God and father of our
[2:13:02] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:13:06] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[2:13:09] blessings
[2:13:11] and he says think of it.
[2:13:15] He has blessed us with all spiritual
[2:13:17] blessings.
[2:13:20] Don't think yourself poor.
[2:13:23] You could be poor,
[2:13:27] but don't think of yourself poor.
[2:13:30] Believe God.
[2:13:32] Trust God.
[2:13:35] He says, "I am the Lord God
[2:13:38] who health all your diseases
[2:13:41] and supplies all your needs.
[2:13:47] He has blessed us with all spiritual
[2:13:49] blessings."
[2:13:52] And he says,
[2:13:54] But he has chosen us in him
[2:13:57] before the foundation of the world. Did
[2:13:59] you think of that?
[2:14:02] He chose us in him before the foundation
[2:14:05] of the world. That we
[2:14:08] should be holy.
[2:14:11] Not because I lived right,
[2:14:15] but because he chose me to be that way.
[2:14:20] He done it, not I.
[2:14:24] that we should be holy.
[2:14:26] That's the reason you are holy this
[2:14:28] afternoon.
[2:14:31] Not because you deserve it,
[2:14:34] but because he chose you to be that way.
[2:14:38] When did he do it? When you believed?
[2:14:42] No, sir. When you had no s before the
[2:14:47] foundation of the world
[2:14:50] holy without blame before him in love.
[2:14:56] How could he do it?
[2:14:59] There had to be a masterpiece. Do it. Do
[2:15:01] that.
[2:15:04] And that was Jesus Christ.
[2:15:06] Now, back there before the foundation of
[2:15:08] the world, God chose you in Jes in
[2:15:12] Christ Jesus to appear holy at the end
[2:15:14] time
[2:15:18] all the way from the foundation of the
[2:15:20] world.
[2:15:22] Do you see it? Think about it, friends,
[2:15:25] that me, God chose me to be holy before
[2:15:31] the foundation of the world. So now
[2:15:34] which force
[2:15:36] can take away my holiness?
[2:15:40] There is nothing.
[2:15:43] Paul says, what shall we then say?
[2:15:47] If God is for us who can be against us,
[2:15:54] who can be against us? If he has chosen
[2:15:57] us before the foundation of the world
[2:16:01] and we are in him,
[2:16:05] then who can be against us?
[2:16:10] What shall we say to the things that
[2:16:13] Christ has done for us?
[2:16:17] Will tribulation separate us?
[2:16:22] Who can separate us from this love with
[2:16:26] which he loved us and chose us and he
[2:16:31] begot us in him and he has adopted us
[2:16:35] into his family.
[2:16:38] What can separate us from that love?
[2:16:42] It's not hunger.
[2:16:44] No sir. It's not sickness.
[2:16:48] It's not tribulation.
[2:16:50] It's not things present,
[2:16:53] nor things to come that shall ever
[2:16:56] separate us from the love of God which
[2:16:59] we have in Christ Jesus.
[2:17:04] According
[2:17:06] now listen close
[2:17:09] according as he has chosen us in him
[2:17:11] before the foundation of the world.
[2:17:14] Who is the us
[2:17:17] there? the church.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; You, me, we are the us.
[2:17:26] He has chosen us. He chose us in him
[2:17:31] before the foundation.
[2:17:33] He chose us in Christ.
[2:17:36] The earth that we should be holy without
[2:17:39] blame.
[2:17:43] Who did it?
[2:17:45] God did it.
[2:17:47] God knowed from the beginning
[2:17:51] who would be saved
[2:17:53] and who would not be saved.
[2:17:56] That's why he said you have not believed
[2:17:58] me.
[2:17:59] You have not believed yet you've heard
[2:18:04] because no man can come to me
[2:18:08] except my father draw him.
[2:18:11] So who did it? It is the father because
[2:18:14] he knowed from the beginning who would
[2:18:17] be saved and who would not be saved.
[2:18:21] Certainly he was
[2:18:24] he was not willing
[2:18:26] for any to perish.
[2:18:30] But he didn't send Jesus here just to
[2:18:32] see
[2:18:36] just to see if you would act or you you
[2:18:40] would not act
[2:18:42] well. Poor Jesus, I feel sorry for him.
[2:18:48] Oh, maybe I would better get saved and
[2:18:50] approve it.
[2:18:52] No, sir. That's not why he sent Jesus.
[2:18:59] God knoweth in the beginning
[2:19:02] who would and who not.
[2:19:05] So therefore he knew
[2:19:08] that some would.
[2:19:10] So he sent Jesus to make appropriation
[2:19:13] for those that he forneew.
[2:19:18] Praise the Lord. That's why he sent
[2:19:20] Jesus.
[2:19:23] For those who he forneew.
[2:19:28] By the fact that we are here today,
[2:19:32] we are those that he forneew
[2:19:37] by the fact that we have believed him.
[2:19:40] We are those that he forneew before the
[2:19:44] foundation of the world.
[2:19:46] For those who he forneew,
[2:19:49] he has called.
[2:19:51] As that he forneew, he has called. And
[2:19:54] those he who he has called,
[2:19:57] he has justified.
[2:19:59] And those who he has justified,
[2:20:03] he has past tense glorified.
[2:20:08] There you are.
[2:20:11] He forneew you. He called you. He has
[2:20:15] justified you. And then he has glorified
[2:20:19] you to be holy in him without any
[2:20:23] blemish.
[2:20:25] So how can you say it's something you
[2:20:27] could do?
[2:20:29] It's nothing you can do. It's God is
[2:20:32] love and grace to you
[2:20:35] that you are even here.
[2:20:38] Nothing you could do but God called you
[2:20:41] by his grace.
[2:20:43] You listened,
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; you heard, you accepted because in you
[2:20:49] is a seed,
[2:20:52] a seed life of God
[2:20:55] that hears and responds to the things of
[2:20:58] God.
[2:21:01] He has chosen us. He has called us.
[2:21:06] He has justified us. He has glorified
[2:21:09] us.
[2:21:11] And he says in questions and answers,
[2:21:14] I stood out yonder
[2:21:17] where that big glass you I stood up
[2:21:21] where that big glass where that big
[2:21:24] glass
[2:21:28] you can see 120 million years of light
[2:21:31] space.
[2:21:34] He was standing up there. The prophet
[2:21:36] says when I looked and seen that
[2:21:40] I didn't get to see through the glass.
[2:21:44] But I seen the picture where they took
[2:21:46] it.
[2:21:48] I just had to raise up my hands
[2:21:51] in there in that place. And I said, "How
[2:21:54] great thou art, how great thou art." And
[2:21:58] before one of those planets ever turned,
[2:22:02] before any of those planets ever turned,
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; planets
[2:22:11] God chose us in Christ Jesus.
[2:22:14] Now, how great thou art.
[2:22:18] Before there was a world, before there
[2:22:20] was a planet, before there was a sun,
[2:22:24] before there was a moon, before there
[2:22:27] was anything,
[2:22:30] when it was still God,
[2:22:32] God and his thoughts, the eternal
[2:22:35] thoughts of God
[2:22:37] shows you by predestination.
[2:22:40] He chose you by forn knowledge
[2:22:43] to know that you would be on earth
[2:22:47] to know there would be sin.
[2:22:50] So if he knew, if God knew us and chose
[2:22:54] us before the world was
[2:22:57] then why the fall?
[2:22:59] Why the fall?
[2:23:02] He say someone said why was there sin?
[2:23:07] Why was there sin?
[2:23:12] If there would never been sin,
[2:23:15] his attributes would have never have
[2:23:18] been a savior.
[2:23:23] There had to be a sinner
[2:23:26] so he could be a savior.
[2:23:29] There had to be a sick man so he could
[2:23:32] be a healer. There you are. It had to be
[2:23:36] that way. It it was God who saw it and
[2:23:41] for day in it. The devil ain't even in a
[2:23:44] picture.
[2:23:46] He's just a stamp on the side
[2:23:50] at a stamp at the side of the road that
[2:23:53] God used to bring children to him
[2:23:57] crying aba father.
[2:24:00] Praise the Lord. No wonder on that day
[2:24:02] how the angels will sing
[2:24:05] when we are singing the redemption
[2:24:07] stories
[2:24:09] the songs of victory.
[2:24:11] Praise the Lord. How we have overcome
[2:24:14] how we have been reconciled.
[2:24:16] How we've overcome the world. Oh, she
[2:24:19] says we will be singing redemption
[2:24:21] stories and the angels will bow their
[2:24:25] heads.
[2:24:26] Why? because they don't know what we are
[2:24:29] talking about.
[2:24:31] Praise the Lord. They were not lost in
[2:24:33] the first place. They never know what
[2:24:36] sin is.
[2:24:38] They don't have any weaknesses.
[2:24:40] But you looking at your weaknesses
[2:24:43] and seeing yourself out there.
[2:24:46] [screaming] You shall sing redemptive
[2:24:47] song,
[2:24:49] songs of victory.
[2:24:51] Praise the Lord, songs of joy
[2:24:55] because you made it there.
[2:24:58] Not by your ability, but because he
[2:25:01] chose you to be there.
[2:25:03] He says, "And angels will bow their
[2:25:05] heads."
[2:25:07] They don't know what you're talking
[2:25:08] about.
[2:25:10] They don't know what you have been
[2:25:11] through.
[2:25:13] You have been hungry
[2:25:17] and you've slept without food. Yet,
[2:25:19] you've not rejected the word.
[2:25:22] You've been through struggles,
[2:25:25] financial struggles,
[2:25:28] and yet you have not rejected the word.
[2:25:32] You have been through sickness.
[2:25:34] You have been through sin,
[2:25:37] and yet you have not given up.
[2:25:40] The angels can't understand that
[2:25:43] because they have not been through it.
[2:25:47] He says they don't know how good
[2:25:50] we feel. know how good we feel to know
[2:25:54] that we which were once sinners
[2:25:58] and alienated from God
[2:26:01] without hope without mercy
[2:26:05] without God in a world of corruption
[2:26:11] dying
[2:26:13] going to a devil's hell
[2:26:16] and God stooped down
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; and picked us up and redeemed us and now
[2:26:23] we are above
[2:26:26] the angels right now.
[2:26:30] Nothing did it. It is his love that did
[2:26:33] it.
[2:26:35] His love paid for my sins.
[2:26:38] His love taken it away.
[2:26:41] Love is the most powerful force there
[2:26:44] is.
[2:26:46] God loved us. Love chosen us in love
[2:26:51] before the foundation of the world.
[2:26:54] Praise the Lord.
[2:27:00] That love
[2:27:02] constrained him provide for our fall
[2:27:06] constrained him to provide for our fall.
[2:27:11] It constrained him to make a plan of
[2:27:13] redemption,
[2:27:15] a plan to preserve his seed.
[2:27:20] Because being an all- knowing God,
[2:27:25] he knew the diversions that would
[2:27:27] surface in the world.
[2:27:31] And he laid a lamp, Jesus Christ,
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; to die and let his blood cleanse us
[2:27:39] from all sin. He loved you. He loved you
[2:27:43] before there was a world.
[2:27:46] Do you believe that?
[2:27:48] He loved you. He knowed your nature.
[2:27:53] Look at yourself. God loved you. Even in
[2:27:56] your nature,
[2:27:59] he loved you anyhow
[2:28:02] because it's not him that gave you that
[2:28:04] nature.
[2:28:06] It is the body and life you born in.
[2:28:09] But he loved you anyhow. Because in you
[2:28:13] is his life.
[2:28:15] And that life will somehow
[2:28:20] fight through and overcome this nature
[2:28:24] to present you as a holy vessel
[2:28:28] before him in love.
[2:28:31] And then he looked all over the great
[2:28:33] universe
[2:28:36] and it was he said I choose you.
[2:28:39] And when he did that before there was
[2:28:41] even a speck of light
[2:28:44] then you were eternal with God.
[2:28:51] When you receive the Holy Ghost, when
[2:28:53] you receive the Holy Ghost,
[2:28:56] then you become eternal
[2:28:58] because you are with God. You are part
[2:29:02] of God. Can you see what I mean? You are
[2:29:05] as eternal as God is.
[2:29:09] You are as eternal as God is
[2:29:14] because you are his seed.
[2:29:18] Praise the Lord.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 7:22 says,
[2:29:25] "For I spake not unto your fathers, nor
[2:29:31] commanded them in that day that I
[2:29:33] brought them out of the land of Egypt
[2:29:35] concerning burnt offerings or
[2:29:36] sacrifices.
[2:30:01] But this thing commanded I them, saying,
[2:30:04] "Obey my voice,
[2:30:08] and I will be your God,
[2:30:11] and you shall be my people and walk in
[2:30:13] all the ways that I have commanded you
[2:30:16] that it may be well unto you.
[2:30:41] Verse 23.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; 23.
[2:30:46] Okay.
[2:31:06] Obey the voice of God. Just obey his
[2:31:09] word and he will be he'll take care of
[2:31:13] us. Praise the Lord. So what when we you
[2:31:16] fall into trials or temptation
[2:31:21] when we fall into such trials and
[2:31:23] temptation.
[2:31:25] Praise the Lord. When trials come, you
[2:31:28] go to stand on the basis
[2:31:31] that you are a covenantal seat
[2:31:35] that it is God that has brought you to
[2:31:37] this battlefield.
[2:31:39] Regardless of the trial,
[2:31:43] be reminded
[2:31:45] that it is God that started your
[2:31:47] journey.
[2:31:49] It has to be God to finish it.
[2:31:53] Stand firm. Believe God and let God
[2:31:55] move.
[2:31:58] It is God that loved you, that chose
[2:32:00] you, and it is God that will protect
[2:32:02] you. Praise the Lord. The prophet says
[2:32:06] now you've got if now if you've got a
[2:32:09] way that you say ups and downs
[2:32:15] ups and downs
[2:32:17] ups you say ups and downs ups and downs.
[2:32:23] Praise the Lord. Ups and downs.
[2:32:26] I would advise you to go to God
[2:32:29] and stay there until you are really born
[2:32:33] again.
[2:32:35] When trials and troubles and heartaches
[2:32:41] and disappointments set in
[2:32:46] something holds,
[2:32:48] not you holding,
[2:32:51] something holding you.
[2:32:53] It isn't a question whether I hold or
[2:32:56] not.
[2:32:58] It's a question whether he held or not.
[2:33:02] It isn't looking at me. It's looking at
[2:33:06] him.
[2:33:07] Praise the Lord. He says when trouble
[2:33:09] set in, you know your position.
[2:33:13] Praise the Lord. It is not you that is
[2:33:15] holding on to him.
[2:33:17] Praise the Lord. It's not a question
[2:33:19] whether you are holding on to him
[2:33:22] or not. Praise the Lord. It is him that
[2:33:26] held
[2:33:28] or held not. But if it is him that held
[2:33:31] you, he will still hold you in that
[2:33:34] situation.
[2:33:36] Why? Because you are his he to be a part
[2:33:41] of him.
[2:33:43] Praise the Lord. So because I stand on
[2:33:45] the foundation
[2:33:47] that he he by fornowledge
[2:33:50] knew me and one condition of life
[2:33:55] and what condition of life I would be.
[2:33:59] this particular time and how I will come
[2:34:02] out of it. He knows my end from the
[2:34:05] beginning
[2:34:07] because this is what makes him God. I
[2:34:10] stand on the basis that I have believed
[2:34:13] him and obeyed his word when he called
[2:34:17] me and now I am certain that he will
[2:34:21] take over my mind
[2:34:24] and to help me look beyond my trial.
[2:34:29] and look away to Jesus because he is the
[2:34:32] author and finisher of my faith. So when
[2:34:37] I'm into trouble,
[2:34:39] I am certain. He says, "Be still.
[2:34:43] Be still.
[2:34:45] Be still
[2:34:47] and know that I am God."
[2:34:53] Praise the Lord. Not how much you hold
[2:34:56] on to.
[2:34:58] situations come.
[2:35:01] Praise the Lord. And you feel so weak to
[2:35:04] hold on.
[2:35:06] But even in that situation,
[2:35:09] praise the Lord. It does not matter
[2:35:11] whether you hold on or not.
[2:35:14] What matters is that he held you.
[2:35:18] Praise the Lord. What matters is that
[2:35:21] he's still holding you.
[2:35:23] Just be still
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; and know that he is God.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And he says in the
[2:35:31] message, redemption by judgment,
[2:35:36] now we base our thoughts this morning
[2:35:39] as people coming to be prayed for.
[2:35:42] We can base our thoughts this
[2:35:46] this evening, this afternoon
[2:35:50] that God has prom what that God has
[2:35:52] promised.
[2:35:54] If you were here this morning, you'd
[2:35:57] say, "Well, brother Brham, brother Bill,
[2:36:00] I've had an up and down
[2:36:04] in life and others have had challenges
[2:36:07] in life. I've always wanted to live a
[2:36:10] Christian life.
[2:36:12] I just never could get myself settled
[2:36:14] down.
[2:36:16] Well, I can base my promise my faith to
[2:36:20] this
[2:36:21] to my brother, sister this morning.
[2:36:24] If you will make that complete
[2:36:26] consecration right now,
[2:36:30] don't wait till you come up to the
[2:36:31] altar. He says you can come up here and
[2:36:35] say
[2:36:37] I now have accepted it. But right where
[2:36:41] you are now, he say God be merciful to
[2:36:44] me, a backslider or a sinner, whatever
[2:36:48] it is. And I now base my hopes on
[2:36:53] nothing
[2:36:56] but your word, I believe it. And he
[2:36:59] says, "Then brother, something is going
[2:37:02] to take place because you you've got a
[2:37:05] real foundation
[2:37:07] for God in no way can cast you out.
[2:37:12] Temptations come. There will never be a
[2:37:15] temptation unless he gives you grace to
[2:37:17] bear it.
[2:37:20] He's promised
[2:37:22] to meet you on every battle front
[2:37:27] right there. He will bless.
[2:37:31] He will bless you. That's where your
[2:37:33] hope is. You'll get to the place. You
[2:37:38] say, "Well, brother Bill, I have so many
[2:37:41] temptations."
[2:37:42] Tell me one Christian that doesn't have
[2:37:45] temptation.
[2:37:47] We never come to a picnic.
[2:37:53] We've come to a battleground.
[2:37:55] We are out here to fight the enemy.
[2:37:59] Why sure we don't put on our armor just
[2:38:04] be looked at.
[2:38:07] If you be if you became a Christian
[2:38:10] just be looked at then you are I'm
[2:38:13] afraid
[2:38:15] you go I'm afraid you got in the wrong
[2:38:16] place.
[2:38:18] Christian sometimes
[2:38:20] is looked down
[2:38:24] upon or made fun of.
[2:38:27] But we come as a warrior
[2:38:30] come sprinkled in the blood.
[2:38:33] The old raggedy cross
[2:38:36] going before us. The morning star
[2:38:39] lighting up the way.
[2:38:42] Why? We are on our road somewhere.
[2:38:46] Don't care what the word says.
[2:38:49] What God said, the field belongs to us.
[2:38:53] The field belongs to us. The field
[2:38:56] belongs to us.
[2:39:02] Praise the Lord. The field belongs to us
[2:39:05] because God said so. It is a promise. We
[2:39:09] are on the road. He promised us eternal
[2:39:12] life. No matter what the devil says
[2:39:16] about it, we are sure we have eternal
[2:39:19] life
[2:39:21] because he promised it, it belongs to
[2:39:24] us. Whether whatever temptation the
[2:39:27] devil brings our way. Whatever trial the
[2:39:30] devil brings our way, the Bible says
[2:39:34] there is no temptation,
[2:39:36] that shall come our way beyond which we
[2:39:40] can overcome. Because in every
[2:39:42] temptation, in every trial, he gives us
[2:39:46] sufficient grace to overcome it. Praise
[2:39:50] the Lord. He says, "Yes, sir. There is
[2:39:53] nothing to be scared about.
[2:39:56] Even if this earth tabernacle is gone,
[2:40:03] we've got one already waiting yonder.
[2:40:07] There is nothing to be scared about."
[2:40:10] Yes sir. Everything belongs to us
[2:40:14] because Christ has redeemed it all to us
[2:40:19] through him and he loved us. And we
[2:40:22] could not come to him unless God rose us
[2:40:25] to him. [clears throat]
[2:40:28] Praise the Lord. And he said, "No man
[2:40:30] can come to me except my father draws
[2:40:32] him to me first.
[2:40:35] All that comes I'll give everlasting
[2:40:37] life and will raise him up at the last
[2:40:40] day.
[2:40:42] What worry have we got at all?
[2:40:45] There is nothing to worry about. Nothing
[2:40:48] to be scared about because all that we
[2:40:51] are, all that we shall be was known
[2:40:55] before the foundation of the world. If
[2:40:58] it is eternal life, it was given to us
[2:41:01] in Christ Jesus
[2:41:03] before the foundation of the world.
[2:41:05] Praise the Lord. So all we got to do is
[2:41:08] to believe God in every situation.
[2:41:12] Recognize who you are that you finished
[2:41:15] work. Then when you learn into fa
[2:41:17] trials,
[2:41:19] reorganize God. That is he who started
[2:41:21] the work. It is he that is going to
[2:41:24] bring to a completion because he knows
[2:41:26] the end.
[2:41:28] From the beginning, he has chosen us in
[2:41:30] him before the foundation of the world
[2:41:33] to be holy
[2:41:36] without any blame
[2:41:38] before him in love.
[2:41:40] And he gives us eternal life.
[2:41:43] Praise the Lord. Not because we
[2:41:45] negotiated for it,
[2:41:48] but we are mandated to receive it.
[2:41:52] Because in us is the seed of God
[2:41:56] which shall never die. When recognize
[2:41:59] that position, we rest the case. In
[2:42:03] trials, you rest the case. In
[2:42:06] temptations, you rest the case. Praise
[2:42:09] the Lord. In tribulations,
[2:42:12] you rest your case.
[2:42:15] Praise the Lord. Because you know God is
[2:42:18] in care. He's in total control.
[2:42:22] He is taking care of everything.
[2:42:26] Praise the Lord. What then shall we say?
[2:42:29] Praise the Lord. Romans 8:28.
[2:42:32] And we know that all things work
[2:42:34] together
[2:42:37] for good to them that love God,
[2:42:40] to them who are called according to his
[2:42:44] purpose.
[2:42:46] interpret
[2:42:50] for whom he did for know.
[2:42:54] He also did predestinate
[2:42:57] to be conformed to the image of his son
[2:43:01] that he might be the firstborn among
[2:43:03] many brethren.
[2:43:06] He for one knew you. He for one knew me.
[2:43:09] Praise the Lord. to be conformed
[2:43:14] to the image of his son.
[2:43:18] Praise the Lord. Moreover, whom he did
[2:43:20] predestinate
[2:43:23] them, he also called.
[2:43:26] So because he predestinated us, he knew
[2:43:30] us before the foundation of the world.
[2:43:32] So he also called us. Praise the Lord.
[2:43:36] And them that he called, he also
[2:43:38] justified.
[2:43:40] He also justified
[2:43:44] and whom he justified
[2:43:47] them he also glorified.
[2:43:51] What then
[2:43:53] shall we say these things?
[2:43:56] If God be for us,
[2:43:59] who can be against us?
[2:44:04] He has loved us. He loves you brother.
[2:44:07] He loves you sister. You are here this
[2:44:10] afternoon
[2:44:11] because he loves you. You are here this
[2:44:14] afternoon because he chose you. You have
[2:44:17] not believed today. You didn't believe
[2:44:19] the day you you think you believed
[2:44:23] and you did not receive salvation
[2:44:26] on the day you accepted this message.
[2:44:28] Salvation has always been a part of you
[2:44:32] because he saved you and he g he gave
[2:44:35] you grace
[2:44:37] before the foundation
[2:44:39] of the world. If he has done all the
[2:44:42] things for us, what then shall we say?
[2:44:46] It is him that loved us. It is him that
[2:44:50] chose us in him before the foundation of
[2:44:53] the world. So we are overcomers.
[2:44:56] We are victorious. We overcome every
[2:44:59] situation
[2:45:00] because he that is in us is much greater
[2:45:05] that any situation that shall come
[2:45:08] before us in this world be assured of
[2:45:13] your victory. Be assured of your eternal
[2:45:16] life.
[2:45:18] Why? Because he has already done it for
[2:45:21] us. So we are simply coming to manifest
[2:45:24] it.
[2:45:25] the manifestation
[2:45:27] of the sons of God. May the Lord bless
[2:45:29] you.
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:33] [applause]
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:41] &gt;&gt; We are the sons of God
[2:45:44] by grace, by predestination,
[2:45:47] by forn knowledge, not of our own works,
[2:45:52] but because he loved us.
[2:45:54] Amen.
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; I
[2:46:03] love him.
[2:46:08] I
[2:46:11] love him.
[2:46:16] Because
[2:46:19] he fast
[2:46:23] love me
[2:46:28] and
[2:46:33] sm
[2:46:45] Oh,
[2:46:47] God.
[2:46:53] I love him. I
[2:46:58] love him.
[2:47:02] I
[2:47:04] love it
[2:47:07] because
[2:47:10] he
[2:47:12] found
[2:47:14] love
[2:47:16] me.
[2:47:20] I
[2:47:25] might [screaming]

[2:47:48] love him.
[2:47:52] I

[2:48:01] he
[2:48:06] love
[2:48:08] me
[2:48:11] and
[2:48:14] passes
[2:48:17] my
