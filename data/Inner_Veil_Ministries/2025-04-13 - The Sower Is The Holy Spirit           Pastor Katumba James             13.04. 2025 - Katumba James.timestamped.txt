[4:53] beyond my
[4:56] ear, but they don't see the eyes of me.
[5:01] I'm hiding all my tears. They don't
[5:06] know that I come running home when I
[5:12] fall. They don't
[5:15] know who picks me up when no one is
[5:20] around.
[5:22] I drop my sword and cry for just a
[5:27] while.
[5:31] But deep inside is a
[5:36] man. The warrior is a
[5:42] child. They don't
[5:47] knowing home when I fall down. Oh, they
[5:52] don't
[5:54] know who picks me up when no one is

[7:04] fall
[7:05] down. They don't

[9:31] Have a few testimonies here.
[9:36] This comes from our precious
[9:45] brother. He says, "God bless you,
[9:47] saints.
[9:50] I greet you all in the name of our Lord
[9:52] Jesus
[9:55] Christ. I thank the grace of God
[10:01] that has held me after a great
[10:07] tragedy after a great
[10:09] [Music]
[10:15] tragedy that happened through the course
[10:18] of the
[10:20] week. I lost my beloved grandmother
[10:26] on the 5th last
[10:29] Saturday and before that we had lost the
[10:32] mother to
[10:40] brother even lost his
[10:43] [Music]
[10:45] beloved. So I departed to go from the
[10:48] barria.
[10:50] [Music]
[10:52] It was a hard time for
[10:55] me and it was
[10:58] challenging. All of a sudden, when we
[11:00] had
[11:03] finished, the burial of my beloved
[11:07] grandmother, we received a phone call
[11:09] that my grandmother had
[11:18] died. The stepmother to my mother again.
[11:22] Mhm.
[11:27] But I thank God for his
[11:29] grace that enabled to stand as a warrior
[11:33] in
[11:36] Christ with gratitude. I thank pastor
[11:38] James
[11:41] Kumba stood with me in this
[11:46] tragedy and others who stood with me in
[11:50] prayer. Not forgetting
[11:54] brother to comfort
[11:57] me and he says yours in Christ
[12:01] brother
[12:03] Joshua. Amen. Amen.
[12:09] That's why he sang that song, a warrior.
[12:15] This comes from our brother Matianka.
[12:22] He says, "I greet you brethren in the
[12:25] name of the risen Lord Jesus Christ.
[12:33] Glory to the master who exalted
[12:38] himself on 1st April
[12:44] 2025 by turning the severe and fatal
[12:47] accident into a
[12:49] mishap by turning the severe and fatal
[12:55] accident.
[12:57] Okay.
[13:00] Before this
[13:02] incident, a certain mechanic went to
[13:05] repair a
[13:09] car model,
[13:13] but he failed to examine the faults on
[13:16] the
[13:19] car. He was referred to me,
[13:25] but after having addressed the fault of
[13:27] the car,
[13:30] The owner was rejecting to pay the
[13:32] [Music]
[13:35] expenses. So the mechanic who referred
[13:38] me the
[13:41] car told me to drive the car to the
[13:46] garage.
[13:48] [Music]
[13:51] But I hit a
[13:55] man carrying a woman.
[13:59] because the braking system instantly
[14:03] failed. I thought I had been I thought
[14:06] they had been so much
[14:10] injured or
[14:12] killed after having been hit by the
[14:16] car. I got out of the car
[14:20] and took
[14:22] off. As many were gathering around the
[14:28] scene, it was not easy to
[14:32] escape. But I thank God that they were
[14:34] not so much injured.
[14:38] It was it was God's intervention that
[14:40] protected and saved
[14:45] me from such a would be greater
[14:48] [Music]
[14:50] case and he says may God bless
[14:54] you. This is brother
[14:59] Matianka. He may be in the
[15:02] background. Yeah. God bless you brother.

[33:32] It's a good morning.
[33:36] Praise the name of the Lord.
[33:40] I've actually seen Victor, but I'm not
[33:42] seeing Steven.
[33:46] He's right here.
[33:49] Congratulations. We're happy that they
[33:51] with us
[33:55] today. Victory gave Steven many titles.
[34:02] When I was calling
[34:04] Steven, I told
[34:11] him and I forgot
[34:16] others. I just pray they keep up in that
[34:19] love.
[34:22] Praise the name of our you know when you
[34:24] are loving one another in
[34:27] marriage you don't grow old or you don't
[34:30] get fed up of one
[34:33] another praise the name of you not be
[34:36] complaining of your
[34:38] wife not be complaining of your
[34:41] husband even if the issues are
[34:44] serious you learn to bear with one
[34:47] another doesn't mean that you don't
[34:49] disagree
[34:53] But the Bible says, don't allow the sun
[34:57] to go over your anger if you're
[35:01] angry. In other words, don't hold
[35:05] anger for the whole day, but learn to be
[35:08] forgiving. Then you saw you can age
[35:12] together. Praise the name of God.
[35:15] Because as you go
[35:17] on, you find that you're only two people
[35:20] at
[35:21] home. If you are hating one
[35:24] another, I don't know you're going to
[35:26] live in the same
[35:28] house. Praise the name of our Lord. So,
[35:30] we just learned to see that, you know,
[35:32] as married
[35:34] people, just keep on loving one
[35:37] another. Praise the name of our Lord.
[35:40] So, our brother Dan is not around with
[35:41] his wife.
[35:44] They traveled to Numar
[35:47] yesterday and you know when the
[35:48] mother-in-law wanted him to go when the
[35:51] mother-in-law Grace's wife wanted them
[35:53] to
[35:56] go so Dan every time escorts the wife to
[35:59] the in-laws
[36:06] place then I told
[36:09] them you keep in that kind of
[36:12] have. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[36:15] families be something which we would
[36:17] love to
[36:19] have. Not again the parents be afraid
[36:22] about their daughter going
[36:25] away or the parents be afraid of their
[36:28] son is going to be taken by another
[36:30] woman or another
[36:34] family. But just to know that we become
[36:37] one when we
[36:39] marry. Praise the name of God. So today
[36:43] we have a sister called Judith.
[36:49] Judith from Wing. If you can stand up,
[36:54] you're
[36:55] [Applause]
[36:57] welcome. She came with our
[37:00] children. Last time when we had the

[37:11] Campala told me that he witnessed to a
[37:14] certain
[37:16] family and then he baptized them in the
[37:18] name of Jesus
[37:20] Christ and told me that one of them is
[37:22] she lives
[37:24] in and so he made me get in touch with
[37:28] her. So we receive to be part of
[37:32] us. Amen.
[37:35] Amen. Our pastor is not around
[37:38] today with his
[37:40] wife. Just keep him in your
[37:43] prayers. He will not be around until
[37:45] next
[37:46] month. So just keep praying for
[37:49] him. Today we'll be ministering in the
[37:52] church of brother
[37:54] Boris. Boris. Their brothers we had
[37:57] there many years ago who came from
[38:02] Congo. So they received him in
[38:05] Canada. So just keep him in your
[38:07] prayers. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[38:10] today we have two
[38:12] services. We have this morning
[38:15] service then the afternoon service
[38:17] starting at 3 to
[38:21] 5. Then after that we have the Lord's
[38:24] supper.
[38:26] Praise the name of our Lord. So we wish
[38:28] to all of us participate in
[38:31] them. Then next Sunday is
[38:34] Easter. We shall have only one service
[38:38] here. Praise the name of our Lord. Then
[38:41] another thing which others should get to
[38:45] know on 18th of
[38:51] May. We want to have a handover
[38:54] function.
[38:56] We shall have a service here at
[39:00] church and then some of the brethren
[39:04] will be making their kind of
[39:07] remarks. Those who have been around for
[39:10] some
[39:11] time, some are not with us now. And then
[39:15] in the lunch
[39:16] time, we shall have lunch all of us
[39:20] together. And then we shall have the
[39:22] function outside the church in the
[39:23] afternoon.
[39:26] We expecting about 600
[39:29] people. They may even be more. We don't
[39:32] know. But we're trying to say that we
[39:34] budget for
[39:36] that. So in that
[39:38] regard we started a handover
[39:45] group that's on WhatsApp. WhatsApp. So
[39:49] if you're not part of the group at least
[39:51] you can
[39:52] approach you can approach I think
[39:55] William
[39:59] Wilson or brother David or myself that
[40:03] you are part of
[40:04] it. Praise the name of our lord. So
[40:07] that's one thing I we should also
[40:09] know. Then in the holidays of
[40:14] children, I think it will start at the
[40:16] end of this month or early next
[40:20] month, we shall be having afternoon
[40:22] services especially for the youth every
[40:29] Sunday in
[40:31] holidays. So we shall just see that we
[40:34] take time with the young
[40:38] people how close we can get to them and
[40:41] how best we can help
[40:44] them because the pressures of the
[40:47] day are not as they were
[40:49] before. Praise the name of our lord.
[40:52] It's also that we say that we pray for
[40:54] it. Then another thing which I wanted
[40:57] also to call at your attention
[41:00] to every morning we have morning
[41:05] exaltations most especially from when
[41:09] Monday up to Friday or
[41:13] Saturday remember from
[41:16] January we've been talking about
[41:19] different
[41:21] scriptures and then on
[41:23] Friday we were to end on the divine
[41:29] nature. But then
[41:31] tomorrow with effect from
[41:35] tomorrow, we want to start the church
[41:37] age
[41:41] book. The seven church age
[41:44] book. So I don't know how many people
[41:46] don't have seven church age. You can
[41:48] just raise your
[41:49] hand personal copy if you don't have
[41:52] English Uganda.
[41:56] If you don't have, you can just raise
[41:57] your
[41:58] hand. I believe everybody has
[42:01] got because we have those books with
[42:04] us, English
[42:06] copies and then Luganda copies and I
[42:10] would urge that we start reading those
[42:15] books. I don't know how long we may take
[42:17] on the seven church age book.
[42:21] We just need to see because the time we
[42:22] have here at church is just not
[42:26] enough. So we're trying to see avenues
[42:29] of where we can go on studying the word
[42:31] of God
[42:35] continuously. And perhaps if you're not
[42:36] on the church WhatsApp group WhatsApp,
[42:40] you can also get to us and then we can
[42:44] make you part of
[42:46] it so that you take be consistent with
[42:49] what we are studying.
[42:52] Praise the name of our Lord. So before
[42:54] you go to the reg invite faith,
[42:59] praise the name of our Lord.
[43:14] [Music]
[43:24] [Music]
[43:45] What's happening if
[43:46] [Music]
[43:58] [Music]
[44:12] It's so cool.
[44:14] [Music]
[44:35] [Music]
[44:46] Thank you.
[44:48] [Music]
[45:05] There were so
[45:07] many
[45:09] others that he
[45:12] might have
[45:15] chosen to follow
[45:21] him.
[45:23] Others with
[45:26] learning and
[45:28] greater
[45:31] distinction to follow
[45:37] him. Men
[45:40] with
[45:42] authority and
[45:45] forceful ability.
[45:49] knew
[45:50] how to speak and be
[45:59] heard. I don't
[46:02] know
[46:04] exactly why I'm
[46:07] here at all.
[46:11] But
[46:13] today I
[46:15] follow my
[46:30] Lord.
[46:35] Heat.
[46:45] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[46:53] [Music]
[46:55] Heat.
[46:57] Heat. Heat.
[47:21] [Music]
[47:25] [Applause]
[47:28] Heat.
[47:32] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[47:49] [Music]
[47:51] It was
[47:53] business as
[47:56] usual. The day
[48:02] Jes come follow
[48:07] me. I left
[48:10] all behind me.
[48:14] The
[48:15] day Jesus said to
[48:18] me, "Come follow me."
[48:25] I
[48:27] emptied myself
[48:30] of my own
[48:33] life
[48:35] completely with no
[48:38] thought that this could be wrong.
[48:47] And as long
[48:49] as I'm
[48:52] [Music]
[48:55] follow the
[48:57] master, then I
[49:01] know I'm where I belong.
[49:28] is I will
[49:38] not
[49:40] for Heat. Heat.
[49:50] [Music]
[50:08] [Music]
[50:13] Heat. Heat.
[50:21] How
[50:22] long does
[50:25] that
[50:27] be? But he chose
[50:30] me to fall.
[50:36] Oh, he touch me.
[50:54] [Music]
[51:00] I could
[51:07] not be
[51:13] following and
[51:17] you
[51:19] shall be.
[51:21] Oh, so strong now.
[51:26] [Music]
[51:33] from now
[51:38] [Music]
[51:44] on. I will
[51:50] not be left behind.
[51:56] But he just needs
[52:00] he just needs to
[52:04] follow him.
[52:07] I will not lose
[52:18] look behind. He chose me. He chose me.
[52:25] to follow.
[52:32] Amen. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[52:35] chose me. Praise the name of our
[52:37] Lord. I believe he chose each and every
[52:40] one of
[52:41] us. I wish we could sing it
[52:44] together. We don't have enough
[52:46] time. Let us stand up. Praise the name
[52:50] of our Lord. He chose me.
[52:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us pray
[52:56] again.
[52:58] Father, we thank you
[53:00] Lord that you chose us
[53:02] Lord out of so
[53:05] many. You said many are
[53:08] called and few are
[53:11] chosen. We are here this morning because
[53:14] you've chosen us. We are the elect of
[53:18] God. Elect lady.
[53:22] Thank thee father that even given us the
[53:25] word of
[53:27] assurance. You've given us the earnest
[53:30] of the
[53:31] spirit that we are your children and we
[53:35] are the bride of Jesus
[53:37] Christ. Pray you may speak to us the
[53:39] word of eternal
[53:41] life establish us that father nothing
[53:45] can sway us away from
[53:48] you. We love you and we thank you Lord.
[53:52] In the name of the Lord Jesus, we do
[53:53] pray and ask
[53:54] this. Amen. Amen. Let us go to
[53:57] Revelation chapter
[54:01] 2 and then reading only verse
[54:05] seven. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[54:08] the Bible
[54:09] says, he that has an
[54:12] ear, let him hear what the spirit says
[54:16] unto the churches. To him that
[54:18] overcomemeth will I give to eat of the
[54:21] tree of life, which is in the midst of
[54:24] the paradise of God.
[54:38] Maying of his
[54:40] word be seated. Praise the name of the
[54:43] Lord. I remember more than a month
[54:47] ago I took a morning
[54:51] exultation and then we were talking
[54:53] about the Ser is the Holy
[54:57] Spirit and I want take that subject
[55:01] today this morning. The Ser is the Holy
[55:05] Spirit.
[55:07] And then in the afternoon, God
[55:10] willing, we want to talk
[55:12] about the
[55:14] anointing is not
[55:19] emotions. This
[55:21] afternoon, so now the Ser is the Holy
[55:26] Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[55:29] see in this
[55:31] scripture, he says, "He that hath an
[55:36] ear, let him hear what the spirit says
[55:39] to the
[55:42] churches." And now the
[55:45] ear is an inside
[55:48] ear. And that
[55:50] year are those people who have been
[55:55] chosen are those people who have been
[55:59] elected who have the
[56:01] ability to hear what the Lord
[56:04] says. Not everybody has the ability to
[56:07] hear what the spirit
[56:10] says. There are people who go to
[56:12] theological
[56:14] schools and then they can read from
[56:17] Genesis to Revelation.
[56:20] And they all you know kind of discussing
[56:23] these
[56:25] scriptures or some can even write books
[56:27] about the
[56:29] scriptures. They take their good time
[56:31] studying
[56:33] it. But you see if they don't have that
[56:36] ear from
[56:39] God know what God has ordained inside of
[56:43] them they cannot hear.
[56:47] Therefore, the seed of
[56:50] life can never be settled in their
[56:54] lives. Praise the name of Lord. You
[56:57] know, a good example is
[56:59] here. When Paul was moving from
[57:02] Jerusalem to
[57:05] Damascus, the Bible says the light shone
[57:09] before
[57:10] them and then they all fell to the
[57:14] ground. Paul had soldiers with him.
[57:18] But it's only
[57:19] Paul who
[57:21] understood what the voice was saying. I
[57:25] believe the other soldiers went back and
[57:26] did their work as
[57:29] soldiers as temple
[57:32] guards. But then Paul had a personal
[57:37] revelation. And then the Bible says he
[57:41] was blind.
[57:43] And when he was cast
[57:45] blind, they just led him by the hand to
[57:47] the
[57:49] city. And then he was in the city three
[57:52] days praying and
[57:54] fasting. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[57:57] it's only Paul who had the
[57:59] voice. It's only Paul had the
[58:03] ear, the ear to
[58:06] hear. Praise the name of the Bible says,
[58:10] "He that has an
[58:12] ear, let him hear what the spirit says
[58:15] unto the
[58:17] churches." So it is the Holy
[58:20] Spirit speaking to the
[58:23] churches. And then what does the Holy
[58:27] Spirit what does he speak to the
[58:30] churches? The Holy Spirit speaks to the
[58:34] churches. The word of God.
[58:37] He does not take his own
[58:40] word. Now in the scriptures here in John
[58:44] chapter
[58:45] 16, praise the name of our
[58:48] Lord. Jesus Christ says in verse 12, I
[58:53] have yet many things to say unto
[58:56] you, but you cannot bear them now.
[59:03] The Lord is saying you have a lot to
[59:05] tell
[59:06] us. You cannot bear them
[59:10] now. And you know what the Lord does? He
[59:13] speaks to
[59:14] us as we have need
[59:18] of. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[59:21] speak to us as we have need
[59:24] of. So he says you cannot bear them now.
[59:29] So then he says, "How bet when he, the
[59:31] Holy
[59:32] Spirit, the Spirit of
[59:35] truth is come, he will guide you into
[59:39] all
[59:40] truth. For he shall not speak of
[59:46] himself, but whatsoever he shall
[59:51] hear, that shall he speak, and he will
[59:54] show you things to come.
[59:58] Praise the name of God. So the Holy
[1:00:01] Spirit is the
[1:00:03] swer. Praise the name of God. It's the
[1:00:06] spirit of
[1:00:07] God that sws the seed of
[1:00:11] God. So now you cannot say praise the
[1:00:15] name of our Lord. Somebody else saw the
[1:00:17] seed and then somebody
[1:00:20] else. It is the same
[1:00:23] spirit. Praise the name of the Lord that
[1:00:26] sews the seed in the
[1:00:28] heart and it's the same Holy
[1:00:31] Spirit that comes behind that
[1:00:34] seed and gives it life.
[1:00:38] Praise the name of the Lord because it's
[1:00:40] the spirit of God speaking to
[1:00:42] us and you know the spirit of God speaks
[1:00:46] to us in different
[1:00:48] ways. The spirit of God can speak to us
[1:00:51] through a
[1:00:53] minister. The spirit of God speak to us
[1:00:56] through somebody
[1:00:58] else. The spirit of God speak to us
[1:01:01] through the
[1:01:02] Bible. The spirit of God speak to us
[1:01:05] through the
[1:01:07] message. The spirit of God speak to us
[1:01:10] when we are hearing the
[1:01:12] message. The spirit of God speak to
[1:01:16] us as an
[1:01:19] individual. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:01:21] The spirit speaks to you.
[1:01:24] You can hear the voice speaking to
[1:01:26] you. The spirit of God can speak to you
[1:01:30] through the
[1:01:31] vision. The spirit of God can speak to
[1:01:35] you through the
[1:01:36] dream. Praise the name of Lord. Like you
[1:01:39] know when the the the wise
[1:01:43] men, God spoke to them through a
[1:01:46] dream. Joseph, God spoke to him through
[1:01:49] a dream.
[1:01:51] Praise the name of Lord. Then Mary saw
[1:01:53] an angel
[1:01:54] coming. The angel spoke to
[1:01:57] her. So the spirit of
[1:01:59] God different ways he can speak to
[1:02:03] us. And the spirit of God speaks nothing
[1:02:08] else but the word of God. So now when
[1:02:12] you hear the word of
[1:02:13] God, the Holy
[1:02:16] Spirit speaking to you. Now the question
[1:02:19] is how far is the Holy Ghost from
[1:02:23] you. It's all about
[1:02:27] obedience. Just obey what the spirit is
[1:02:29] telling you and the spirit himself will
[1:02:34] come and give
[1:02:36] life to the word that you've
[1:02:39] heard. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:02:41] now in verse 14 he says he shall glorify
[1:02:46] me for he shall receive of
[1:02:49] mine and shall show it unto
[1:02:53] you all things that the father has are
[1:02:59] mine. Therefore said
[1:03:02] I shall take of
[1:03:05] mine and show it unto
[1:03:08] you. Praise the name of the Lord. that
[1:03:10] the spirit is the
[1:03:13] swer. He's the one who sws the word of
[1:03:17] God. Now in the message God
[1:03:20] commissioning
[1:03:21] Moses, brother Brham was in prayer now
[1:03:24] saying, "Our heavenly father, we thank
[1:03:28] thee tonight for the word." Jesus our
[1:03:32] Lord
[1:03:33] said, "Search the
[1:03:35] scriptures, for in them you think you
[1:03:38] have eternal
[1:03:40] life, and the idea which testify of
[1:03:45] me, and we thank thee for thy written
[1:03:49] word. And now father we pray that the
[1:03:53] great swer of all
[1:03:57] ages the Holy Spirit will show the seed
[1:04:01] into will sow the seed into the hearts
[1:04:04] of the
[1:04:05] people and may it be
[1:04:09] watered and bring forth a great harvest
[1:04:12] of the
[1:04:15] souls and healing for those who are
[1:04:17] already wfairing men in the
[1:04:23] forgive us of our many sins and
[1:04:26] trespasses. We pray that you bless us
[1:04:30] now and open the word, oh lamb of
[1:04:35] God. We might read from the Bible, but
[1:04:39] at the only
[1:04:41] one who can open the
[1:04:43] book or lose the seals
[1:04:47] there slain from the foundation of the
[1:04:51] world. Help us tonight.
[1:04:54] May the Holy
[1:04:55] Spirit take the word of
[1:04:58] God and place it in every
[1:05:02] heart just where it is needed.
[1:05:06] Give us great faith
[1:05:08] Lord that what we are
[1:05:11] needing a stimulation of
[1:05:14] faith is
[1:05:16] steering. Praise the name of God. He
[1:05:18] says the Holy
[1:05:20] Spirit let the Holy Ghost take the word
[1:05:22] of God.
[1:05:25] and put it in our heart. So the Holy
[1:05:28] Spirit is the
[1:05:30] Ser. So if the word of God to be
[1:05:34] sown, he has to take the Holy
[1:05:38] Spirit using any
[1:05:41] instrument either a minister or through
[1:05:44] the Bible or through the text or
[1:05:48] wherever
[1:05:50] you praise the name of our Lord. The
[1:05:53] Holy Spirit is the
[1:05:54] swer. Now, if the Holy Ghost has swed
[1:05:58] the
[1:05:59] seed, how will the Holy
[1:06:03] Spirit refused it to
[1:06:07] rain? Ask yourself, if the Holy Spirit
[1:06:12] has sown the seed in your
[1:06:14] heart, how God say, "I'm not releasing
[1:06:16] the rain."
[1:06:19] How would the Holy Ghost say I'm not
[1:06:22] following that
[1:06:23] word? It's not
[1:06:26] possible. Praise the name of it's not
[1:06:29] possible. So when you receive the word
[1:06:31] of
[1:06:32] God, just open up your heart and say,
[1:06:36] Lord, this is mine. Praise the name of
[1:06:39] Lord. And then you rejoice at the word
[1:06:41] of
[1:06:41] God. Obey the word of God. And then you
[1:06:45] will see the word being quickened.
[1:06:49] by the same Holy
[1:06:51] Spirit that held it in your heart.
[1:06:54] Praise the name of our Lord. So now the
[1:06:56] issue of
[1:06:59] complication about the baptism of the
[1:07:01] Holy
[1:07:02] Spirit, it's not
[1:07:04] there. Praise the name of God. Because
[1:07:07] it is God
[1:07:09] himself
[1:07:10] promised. And when God
[1:07:13] promises, he does it. What do you do?
[1:07:17] Be
[1:07:18] obedient and that's
[1:07:20] all. Praise the name of our Lord. Be
[1:07:23] obedient and that is all. And then the
[1:07:27] spirit comes out and manifest his word
[1:07:29] in your
[1:07:30] life. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:07:33] in the parable of the
[1:07:35] Ser before we got the parable of the
[1:07:38] Ser let us go back to Revelation chapter
[1:07:42] 2 in verse 11.
[1:07:46] So you see that in the church in the
[1:07:48] church
[1:07:50] ages it was the Holy
[1:07:53] Spirit that was speaking the
[1:07:56] word. In verse
[1:07:58] 11 was speaking to the church of
[1:08:02] Sima, he that has an
[1:08:05] ear, let him hear what the spirit says
[1:08:08] unto the
[1:08:10] churches. When it comes to the church of
[1:08:13] Pgamos, again he says in verse
[1:08:16] 17, he that has an ear, let him hear
[1:08:20] what the spirit says unto the
[1:08:22] church. When he come to the church of
[1:08:25] Stitus, he again says in verse
[1:08:28] 29, he
[1:08:31] hear what the spirit says unto the
[1:08:34] churches. When he come to the church of
[1:08:37] Sadis, he says in Revelation 3:6,
[1:08:41] He that has an ear, let him hear what
[1:08:44] the spirit says unto the
[1:08:47] churches when he comes to the church of
[1:08:51] Philadelphia. Revelation
[1:08:54] 3:13, he says, "He that has an
[1:08:56] ear, let him hear what the spirit
[1:09:00] says." And finally in the Lician
[1:09:04] church, Revelation
[1:09:07] 3:22, he that has an
[1:09:10] ear, let him hear what the spirit says
[1:09:13] about the
[1:09:15] churches. So it is the Holy
[1:09:18] Spirit that has been the
[1:09:20] swer through all the seven church
[1:09:24] ages. But then how was the Holy Ghost
[1:09:27] so in every church age?
[1:09:31] there was a
[1:09:33] messenger. And that's why you see that
[1:09:35] at every introduction of an
[1:09:38] age like in the in the church age of
[1:09:42] Ephesus, it says unto the angel of the
[1:09:45] church of
[1:09:48] Ephesus. So in each age there was a
[1:09:52] single
[1:09:53] man who is the messenger of the age who
[1:09:57] was receiving a true revelation from
[1:09:59] God.
[1:10:01] And the revelation that God was giving
[1:10:03] each
[1:10:05] message was what the spirit was saying
[1:10:08] to that church.
[1:10:10] But the spirit was sent to that church
[1:10:13] age. And then brother Brandham tells us
[1:10:16] the faithful
[1:10:18] ministers they will go to the
[1:10:21] messenger and then take what the
[1:10:23] messenger has
[1:10:24] told and then broadcast it to
[1:10:28] others like what we are doing now. We
[1:10:31] are receiving from the
[1:10:33] messenger and then giving it to the
[1:10:35] people. So it is still the same Holy
[1:10:39] Spirit speaking to us. Praise the name
[1:10:43] of our Lord. So you see that the order
[1:10:44] of the
[1:10:46] Lord, God leads his
[1:10:50] church. God guides his church by the
[1:10:54] Holy
[1:10:56] Spirit. But then God has set men in the
[1:11:00] church like in Ephesians 4:1.
[1:11:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Ephesians
[1:11:11] 4:11. The scripture
[1:11:15] says, "And he gave some apostles and
[1:11:18] some prophets and some evangelists and
[1:11:21] some pastors and
[1:11:32] teachers." Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:11:34] So he says he gave
[1:11:37] some not
[1:11:39] all. So he chooses a select
[1:11:43] people for the purpose of the
[1:11:47] ministry. And then they become the gifts
[1:11:50] to the
[1:11:52] church. They become the gifts to the
[1:11:55] body. And now by the grace that God has
[1:11:59] given, God is able to use
[1:12:02] them. Praise the name of our Lord to
[1:12:05] speak to the body of
[1:12:06] Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:12:09] in the message the fundamental
[1:12:10] foundation of our
[1:12:13] faith, brother Brham says that is right.
[1:12:18] For it does not lay within
[1:12:21] man. We are only
[1:12:24] instruments that the revelation of God
[1:12:27] can be brought forth through our
[1:12:31] lips as the Holy
[1:12:33] Spirit speaks as we yield ourself to
[1:12:38] him. Then he says, "Many of you
[1:12:41] ministers
[1:12:43] here, you don't want to say
[1:12:46] that you just spitted out a sermon and
[1:12:49] stood and popped it off.
[1:12:54] You don't you would want to say it from
[1:12:59] inspiration. I believe it certainly.
[1:13:03] Well, it has to come from the Holy
[1:13:06] Spirit that energizes you to
[1:13:10] speak that message. If it
[1:13:13] isn't, you'll never be
[1:13:16] successful. Praise the name of God. Then
[1:13:19] he says, "This is Charlesy
[1:13:22] and so forth." And the man who copied
[1:13:25] their
[1:13:27] sermons. And when they got up
[1:13:30] there and preached it with the
[1:13:33] inspiration, the Holy Ghost, the same
[1:13:36] sermon, he
[1:13:38] preached the night
[1:13:40] before, hundreds brought to the
[1:13:44] altar. There is such a difference.
[1:13:47] is go to be
[1:13:49] inspired. The Holy Ghost is God to
[1:13:52] anctionize
[1:13:55] it. So it is with
[1:13:58] healing. There's got to be something
[1:14:00] takes place through a divine
[1:14:04] gift that will energize the
[1:14:07] people with the Holy Ghost to
[1:14:11] believe. Praise the name of God. So the
[1:14:14] Holy
[1:14:15] Spirit is the
[1:14:17] s uses the ministers to sow the
[1:14:21] word and then when we receive the word
[1:14:25] we need to obey the word for the word to
[1:14:28] become
[1:14:29] alive. Praise the name of our lord. So
[1:14:32] the spirit of
[1:14:33] God guides us in
[1:14:37] everything. Praise the name of our lord.
[1:14:39] Let us go the parable of the sword.
[1:14:44] in Mark 13 and then verse three.
[1:14:51] The Bible
[1:14:54] says, "And he spoke many things unto
[1:14:57] them in parables, saying, Behold, a s
[1:14:59] went forth to
[1:15:07] s." And when he saw, some fell by the
[1:15:10] west side, and the falls came and
[1:15:13] divided them up.
[1:15:22] And some fell upon stony places where
[1:15:25] they had not much earth. And forth with
[1:15:27] they sprung up because they had no
[1:15:30] deepness of earth.
[1:15:48] And when the sun was up, they were
[1:15:50] scorched. And because they had no root,
[1:15:53] they withered
[1:15:59] away. And some fell among thorns, and
[1:16:03] the thorns sprung up and chokeed them.
[1:16:10] But other fell in good ground and
[1:16:13] brought forth fruit. Some 100, some
[1:16:16] 60fold, and some
[1:16:26] 30fold. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:16:29] he says, "The ser went out to
[1:16:32] SW." We look at the Holy
[1:16:35] Spirit. sowing the seed. Praise the name
[1:16:39] of Lord. Then he say some fell on the
[1:16:42] west
[1:16:43] side and then some fell in the stony
[1:16:47] ground. Some fell in the stony
[1:16:50] ground and then some fell in the good
[1:16:54] ground. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:16:57] when Christ is interpreting that
[1:17:00] parable, we go further to verse 18.
[1:17:06] He says, "Hear therefore the parable of
[1:17:09] the
[1:17:12] ser." Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:17:15] Believe I can pick it up in a more
[1:17:16] clearer
[1:17:19] place. Luke chapter
[1:17:22] 8. Praise the name of our Lord. Luke
[1:17:25] chapter
[1:17:26] [Music]
[1:17:28] 8. And then we go to verse 11.
[1:17:33] He says, "Now the parable is
[1:17:36] this. The seed is the word of God.
[1:17:42] The seed is the word of God. The seed is
[1:17:46] not
[1:17:48] money. Praise the name of our Lord." Now
[1:17:50] we have our brother who
[1:17:54] say, but they meaning money. But here
[1:17:58] the seed is the word of God.
[1:18:01] Praise the name of God. The seed is not
[1:18:05] money. The seed is the word of
[1:18:09] God. And what is the
[1:18:12] ground? Verse 12. Those by the
[1:18:18] wayside. Are they that hear?
[1:18:22] and cometh the
[1:18:24] devil and take away the word out of
[1:18:27] their
[1:18:29] heart, lest they should believe and be
[1:18:34] saved. So the the
[1:18:36] ground is the nature of the
[1:18:41] heart. What is the condition of your
[1:18:45] heart? Just as we've come to church this
[1:18:48] morning, what is the condition of my
[1:18:50] heart?
[1:18:52] Now that's where we need to find
[1:18:56] ourselves. Will the seed sown
[1:18:59] grow or it will not grow? Because he
[1:19:03] talks about three kinds of
[1:19:06] ground the west
[1:19:08] side. Then he talks about the stony
[1:19:13] ground. Then he talks about the stony
[1:19:16] ground. And then he talks about the good
[1:19:19] ground.
[1:19:21] Now the condition of your
[1:19:23] heart, you have control over
[1:19:26] it that is in your
[1:19:29] hand. What is the condition of my heart?
[1:19:34] When I come to the church, am I in
[1:19:39] expectation when I come to church? I
[1:19:42] don't know how it's going to be. When I
[1:19:45] come to church, I just come to come and
[1:19:48] maybe for a roll
[1:19:52] call, a show
[1:19:54] up or when I come to church, do I come
[1:19:57] to meet
[1:19:59] friends or when I come to church? Do I
[1:20:02] come to make business
[1:20:06] networks? You know there are some people
[1:20:08] who are
[1:20:09] smart and he wants you and he knows you
[1:20:13] pray from the other
[1:20:15] church says let me go there let me be
[1:20:18] part of the choir so I can also be known
[1:20:22] but the target is somebody
[1:20:25] else or let me go and be
[1:20:28] an welcome and you only show that person
[1:20:32] kindness.
[1:20:35] You know there are some people who are
[1:20:38] smart. Praise the name of you know some
[1:20:42] years ago they used to tell us that
[1:20:46] university students would go to some of
[1:20:47] those popular churches in
[1:20:51] Kala was called Pentecostal
[1:20:55] Church. Now it
[1:20:57] is. So university students go
[1:21:00] there and so they know at a certain time
[1:21:05] Either the pastor will tell
[1:21:08] them hug one
[1:21:10] another. So he touches a girl he wants
[1:21:13] or a boy he
[1:21:15] wants. When the time
[1:21:19] comes and then he tells them now we can
[1:21:23] go out for
[1:21:25] evangelism and then go two by two and
[1:21:28] then they start from
[1:21:30] there just target
[1:21:33] workers. So you know that
[1:21:36] heart is a
[1:21:40] wayside not to receive the
[1:21:42] seat but to seek their
[1:21:46] own or when a prominent person comes to
[1:21:49] this
[1:21:50] church maybe like we have the mayor or
[1:21:54] maybe we have a
[1:21:55] minister he goes to the other church
[1:21:58] then somebody goes to that church he has
[1:22:00] to seek
[1:22:02] appointments or like here in
[1:22:05] district we have district service
[1:22:09] commission. So he says the chairperson
[1:22:12] prays from that
[1:22:16] church from that church. So he becomes
[1:22:19] so
[1:22:22] close but he wants a job. He wants a job
[1:22:26] for his
[1:22:28] children for his friends. Just see how
[1:22:31] he lobbies.
[1:22:34] People are
[1:22:36] smart. But when we come to church, let
[1:22:40] us come to receive the seed
[1:22:43] of praise the name of above
[1:22:46] opportunities. Oh, if we have a bank
[1:22:50] manager and you have a
[1:22:53] loan, you want a
[1:22:56] loan. He goes from that church. goes
[1:23:00] there, sees where he's going to sit,
[1:23:03] then he goes and sits
[1:23:05] nearby. Sir, how are you? The service
[1:23:08] has been
[1:23:10] good just to make a
[1:23:14] connection. Some of us
[1:23:17] cheeky and those who want wives or
[1:23:21] husbands, they can also do the same. Now
[1:23:24] for you, you think this brother is so
[1:23:26] kind to
[1:23:27] me. Oh, this sister is so kind to
[1:23:31] me. But you know, things have to be
[1:23:35] proved. You don't just
[1:23:38] rush. Praise the name of God. So he says
[1:23:41] the
[1:23:42] heart is the condition of the
[1:23:46] ground. So now when we come to church,
[1:23:49] what is the condition of our
[1:23:52] heart? And that's m that matters a
[1:23:55] lot. Like right now it's raining.
[1:23:59] You may have a good
[1:24:02] ground, but as long as the good ground
[1:24:04] has got
[1:24:08] weeds, then the seed which is
[1:24:11] sown will face a lot of competition from
[1:24:15] the
[1:24:17] weeds. The
[1:24:20] thorns, praise the name of our Lord,
[1:24:22] they will choke it. And you know the
[1:24:25] seed that fell in the thorny ground
[1:24:29] was a very danger was a very bad
[1:24:32] condition because the Bible says it grew
[1:24:36] up. But now when the time of putting on
[1:24:40] fruit, the thorns choked
[1:24:44] it. The thorns choked
[1:24:47] it. And that's where the problem we have
[1:24:50] many
[1:24:51] times. The thorns in our lives they
[1:24:56] choke this. They choke this. They choke
[1:24:59] this. Let us take more time on the
[1:25:03] thorns. Let us read in Luke chapter
[1:25:07] 8 and then verse
[1:25:10] 14. And they which fell among the
[1:25:14] thorns are they
[1:25:16] which when they have heard
[1:25:20] go forth.
[1:25:22] and are choked with
[1:25:26] cares,
[1:25:28] riches and pleasures of this
[1:25:31] life and bring no fruit to
[1:25:37] perfection. Very unfortunate
[1:25:40] condition. He says the thorns are the
[1:25:44] cares. That's one stage of life.
[1:25:49] Riches, thorns, another stage. Then
[1:25:54] pleasures another
[1:25:56] stage. You cannot be troubled by
[1:25:59] pleasure which
[1:26:05] cares and then you think about
[1:26:09] pleasures. You can't. You don't have any
[1:26:14] money. There's no food at home.
[1:26:18] There is no
[1:26:20] treatment. There is no
[1:26:23] rent, school fees, school fees. And then
[1:26:26] you say, "Let me go to
[1:26:30] Chivanda." It's hard. It's another
[1:26:34] stage. You don't have any
[1:26:37] money. You'll not think about buying
[1:26:40] something
[1:26:42] luxurious. Instead, you look at it as
[1:26:44] wasting money.
[1:26:50] You're just wasting money wearing that
[1:26:51] shirt because you you feel like that's
[1:26:54] too
[1:26:55] much. I have better value for
[1:26:58] it. But you see the devil comes to us at
[1:27:02] every level of life we are
[1:27:05] in. When you don't have
[1:27:08] anything, Satan is there. When you have
[1:27:12] things, Satan is there. When we have
[1:27:15] more than you
[1:27:16] need, Satan is
[1:27:18] there. So you have to overcome him at
[1:27:21] every stage of
[1:27:24] life. When you don't
[1:27:27] have, the devil can tempt
[1:27:30] you. Go and steal because you don't
[1:27:34] have. When you don't have, the devil can
[1:27:37] tell you you are wasting your time to go
[1:27:39] to church.
[1:27:42] Now it has rained today. Why don't you
[1:27:45] go in your
[1:27:46] garden? You're just wasting there. You
[1:27:48] don't yet poor and you think it's a good
[1:27:53] idea. But the
[1:27:56] devil
[1:27:59] cares now the time of
[1:28:04] service but the customers are
[1:28:08] coming and then they are calling you all
[1:28:10] the time.
[1:28:12] So what can I tell
[1:28:13] them? You find an
[1:28:17] excuse like you can come to
[1:28:20] church and your mind is on the business
[1:28:30] call. So you the preacher is preaching
[1:28:34] all the time thinking I put the phone on
[1:28:37] silent
[1:28:41] miss
[1:28:44] thorns. So it is choking the
[1:28:48] seed. It is hindering
[1:28:51] you. So you come out
[1:28:55] immediately. Your mind is not with the
[1:28:57] people for
[1:29:00] fellowship but what you've been thinking
[1:29:03] about trouble of
[1:29:05] chaos. So then the Bible says it
[1:29:10] chokes you all the time
[1:29:16] afraid. We are going to have two
[1:29:20] services now again.
[1:29:25] Amen. Then you start looking around for
[1:29:27] an excuse.
[1:29:30] But sometimes there's
[1:29:33] cars. Praise the name
[1:29:35] of there's a brother I
[1:29:38] called. Then I asked him, "Brother, what
[1:29:43] happened? Why were you around for
[1:29:45] afternoon
[1:29:46] s?" And even the Lord is up. Then he
[1:29:49] told me you have to go to look for money
[1:29:51] for
[1:29:53] food
[1:29:57] cares. It's
[1:30:00] trouble but you know Satan targeted us
[1:30:03] at every
[1:30:06] stage. You know the way the Bible say
[1:30:10] you had enough six
[1:30:13] days then on Sunday you bring your
[1:30:17] problem and you can't plan some of those
[1:30:20] things the other
[1:30:24] days you know Sunday is the most
[1:30:26] conducive
[1:30:28] day
[1:30:30] ths so they are choking that
[1:30:34] seed it's a heart
[1:30:38] condition. You know what is
[1:30:40] happening? It is this. We had a brother
[1:30:44] here over 10 years
[1:30:48] ago and you know he was participating a
[1:30:51] lot in the
[1:30:52] ministry. He was a very good upcoming up
[1:30:55] song
[1:30:57] leader and then it so
[1:31:02] happened when he started his final exams
[1:31:07] He
[1:31:09] disappeared. He
[1:31:11] disappeared to connect with him. It was
[1:31:14] after
[1:31:16] year that's what happened. You know, I
[1:31:19] was busy in exams and
[1:31:22] unfortunately he didn't do well in those
[1:31:25] exams
[1:31:27] cares. In other
[1:31:29] words, the things of God are secondary.
[1:31:35] They are not the primary
[1:31:37] thing. They're not the most important
[1:31:39] thing in my
[1:31:41] life. But the Bible says, "Seek you
[1:31:44] first the kingdom of
[1:31:47] God, his
[1:31:49] righteousness, then all these things
[1:31:51] shall be
[1:31:52] added." But the brother didn't have
[1:31:54] faith for
[1:31:57] that. He didn't have enough faith.
[1:32:01] So now he
[1:32:02] went in church
[1:32:06] reading and he lacked
[1:32:11] wisdom. You are reading the whole
[1:32:13] night then you go to the exams and then
[1:32:17] you
[1:32:20] sleep
[1:32:22] cares
[1:32:24] thorns then they
[1:32:26] choke and you know
[1:32:28] sometimes we don't reach our full
[1:32:33] potential because we put the things of
[1:32:35] God to be of much of less
[1:32:40] importance. So you find that somebody is
[1:32:42] being overcome by the same situation all
[1:32:44] the
[1:32:47] time. What is the
[1:32:49] problem? Where are the
[1:32:52] thorns? All the time you have this
[1:32:55] habit. All the time you have this issue.
[1:32:58] All the time you have this issue.
[1:33:02] Thorns. They just need to be uprooted
[1:33:05] out. Praise the name of. So when cares
[1:33:09] trouble
[1:33:12] you, you know, you can even hate
[1:33:16] church, you can even start despising
[1:33:21] others.
[1:33:22] Cares. So now when you know that I have
[1:33:26] chaos, then you work hard and when you
[1:33:30] work hard, you get
[1:33:32] money. Now Satan comes at that level as
[1:33:36] well.
[1:33:39] riches. You find your minds all the time
[1:33:42] on your
[1:33:44] possessions. Now I don't
[1:33:46] know now maybe you have installed the
[1:33:49] cameras on your
[1:33:51] phone. So instead of going in the
[1:33:54] service on the
[1:33:56] cameras let me count how many clients
[1:33:58] are coming to my
[1:34:01] shop. Trouble of
[1:34:05] riches. How much money have we made
[1:34:09] today? 12 of
[1:34:11] riches. You have possessions that have
[1:34:14] taken all your
[1:34:16] heart. You are far away from
[1:34:19] God. Like the rich young
[1:34:22] ruler. He wanted eternal
[1:34:25] life, but he wanted it without losing
[1:34:30] anything. So when he had Christ telling
[1:34:33] him, "Here is eternal life.
[1:34:36] But you have riches. And then he says,
[1:34:39] dispose what you
[1:34:41] have and come and follow eternal
[1:34:44] life. No,
[1:34:47] he lost eternal
[1:34:49] life. He had his
[1:34:51] riches, but it is
[1:34:54] temporary. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:34:57] You look at what's happening all over
[1:34:58] the
[1:35:00] world. Tariffs rising taxes
[1:35:04] here until people are just
[1:35:09] confused. They're now wondering what are
[1:35:11] we going to do? What are we going to do?
[1:35:13] Because their hearts are in those
[1:35:16] things like during the time
[1:35:18] of many rich men in those developed
[1:35:21] countries were committing suicide.
[1:35:25] They were committing
[1:35:26] suicide because they seeing their wealth
[1:35:28] just coming down all of a
[1:35:33] sudden. You know riches of this
[1:35:36] world then pleasures of
[1:35:40] life. When you have more
[1:35:43] money on Sunday, you can afford to go
[1:35:47] for
[1:35:50] rallies. When you can afford to go for
[1:35:52] those big shows somewhere
[1:35:55] else, the things of God are not
[1:35:58] important to
[1:36:00] you, the pleasures of this
[1:36:03] life. And Satan always comes to your
[1:36:06] level.
[1:36:10] He comes to your
[1:36:11] level. If you're a religious person,
[1:36:15] he'll come as a religious
[1:36:17] person. Whatever level you are at, he
[1:36:20] always
[1:36:21] comes as a friend to just take a hold of
[1:36:26] you. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[1:36:29] verse 15, Luke
[1:36:33] 8:15, the Bible says, "But that on the
[1:36:37] good
[1:36:39] ground are they in an honest and good
[1:36:45] heart, having heard the
[1:36:48] word and keep
[1:36:50] it, and bring forth fruit with
[1:36:55] patience." And this should be our
[1:36:58] concern.
[1:37:00] Lord, I want to be a good
[1:37:02] ground. Praise the name of when I come
[1:37:05] to
[1:37:06] church. Lord, I want to be that good
[1:37:09] ground. And when I'm a good ground, the
[1:37:13] Bible says, when you hear the
[1:37:16] word, what do you do to the word? You
[1:37:19] keep
[1:37:21] it. Praise the name of Lord. And you
[1:37:23] know,
[1:37:24] keeping, you keep what is precious.
[1:37:29] You treasure
[1:37:31] it. You value
[1:37:33] it. You
[1:37:37] estimate. You think about
[1:37:39] it. How secure is
[1:37:42] this? He says you keep the word. When
[1:37:46] you hear the word, you keep the word.
[1:37:49] And now when you keep the word then the
[1:37:52] Bible says bring forth
[1:37:56] fruit with patience.
[1:38:00] Praise the name of Lord. So there's
[1:38:02] there are things that you go
[1:38:05] through. You know there are testing that
[1:38:07] you go
[1:38:08] through. There are trials that you go
[1:38:10] through. But then you have to be
[1:38:13] patient.
[1:38:15] The word you have
[1:38:17] received comes to
[1:38:20] manifestation. The same thing with the
[1:38:22] word of
[1:38:23] God. Like the farmer planting
[1:38:26] now, do you not expect to harvest
[1:38:30] tomorrow, but then there are stages you
[1:38:32] have to go
[1:38:33] through. And then you see that you
[1:38:35] protect
[1:38:37] yourself from animals eating the
[1:38:41] plant, from pests eating the
[1:38:43] plants, from wheat suffocating the
[1:38:47] plant. And then you are
[1:38:49] careful. You see that it grows
[1:38:52] up. It requires
[1:38:55] patience. And that's the same thing with
[1:38:57] the Christian
[1:38:58] life. It requires patience.
[1:39:03] But you have to know where you are
[1:39:05] going. Praise the name of Jesus. So make
[1:39:08] sure that your
[1:39:10] heart doesn't have
[1:39:13] pests, pests of
[1:39:15] unbelief, ps of
[1:39:19] contradiction, pace of
[1:39:22] doubt. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:39:24] that you bring the seed with
[1:39:29] patience. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:39:31] So he says you keep the
[1:39:33] word when you hear the word you keep the
[1:39:38] word. Now let us follow
[1:39:41] upkeeping in Luke in John chapter
[1:39:45] 14 and then verse
[1:39:48] 21. The Bible says he that hath my
[1:39:54] commandments and keepeth them.
[1:39:59] In other words, you've heard the
[1:40:01] word. So, as you have heard the
[1:40:04] word, how about
[1:40:07] it? You've heard the word, are you
[1:40:10] keeping the
[1:40:11] word? Are you talking about the
[1:40:14] word? Are you meditating on the
[1:40:17] word? You know, are you, you know,
[1:40:19] testifying about the
[1:40:21] word? Are you desiring the
[1:40:24] word? All these avenues of keeping the
[1:40:28] word
[1:40:31] had the word, meditate upon the word of
[1:40:35] God day and night. And when you met upon
[1:40:39] the word of God
[1:40:41] day, the Bible says, but his
[1:40:46] delight is in the law of the
[1:40:49] law. His
[1:40:51] delight, what actually pleases
[1:40:56] him is the word of God.
[1:40:59] That should be the same thing with us.
[1:41:01] When I hear the word of
[1:41:03] God is my
[1:41:07] response of God, it should make you
[1:41:11] happy. Praise the name of our Lord. It
[1:41:14] should make you
[1:41:16] joyous, you know, thankful to
[1:41:19] God. The Bible says the word is not
[1:41:26] grievious. Let us go to the book of
[1:41:28] John. Let me get that
[1:41:31] scripture. Praise the name of our
[1:41:38] Lord. First
[1:41:41] John chapter
[1:41:45] 5:3 chapter 5 and then verse
[1:41:50] three. The Bible
[1:41:52] says, "For this is the love of God,
[1:41:59] that we keep his
[1:42:03] commandment and his
[1:42:07] commandments are not
[1:42:12] grievious. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:42:15] He says this is the love of
[1:42:18] God. Oh Lord, I love you. I love you and
[1:42:22] then you don't keep the word. Says no.
[1:42:26] You don't love me because when I give
[1:42:29] you the
[1:42:31] seat, you throw it
[1:42:35] out, you abort
[1:42:41] it like a husband and a
[1:42:44] wife. when the wife becomes conceives
[1:42:47] because of the
[1:42:49] husband and then removes it and then
[1:42:52] says I love my
[1:42:56] husband. There's no love
[1:42:58] there. So we receive the word in our
[1:43:02] heart in the womb of our
[1:43:06] heart and then we abort it.
[1:43:12] I love
[1:43:13] God but I have hatred for another
[1:43:17] person. Then the Bible says how do you
[1:43:21] love God who you don't
[1:43:24] see and then you hate the person that
[1:43:26] you
[1:43:27] see says
[1:43:29] no praise the name of our Lord. So in
[1:43:32] verse two he
[1:43:34] says 1 John
[1:43:39] 5:2 he says by this we know that we love
[1:43:43] the children of
[1:43:52] God when we love
[1:43:54] God and keep his
[1:43:58] commandments for this is the love of
[1:44:01] God that we keep his
[1:44:05] commandments and his commandments are
[1:44:07] not
[1:44:10] grievious. In other words, it should
[1:44:12] rejoice your
[1:44:13] heart, you know, to hear the word and
[1:44:16] then you obey the
[1:44:19] word. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:44:21] when you hear the word and then you obey
[1:44:24] the word, you keep the
[1:44:27] word then shows that you love God. And
[1:44:32] he says,
[1:44:33] he that loveth
[1:44:36] me, and he that loveth me shall be loved
[1:44:40] of my
[1:44:42] father, and I will love him, and will
[1:44:46] manifest myself to him.
[1:44:50] Praise the name of Lord. Then Judas says
[1:44:52] unto him,
[1:44:54] not Escariot,
[1:44:56] Lord, how is it that you will manifest
[1:44:58] yourself to
[1:45:00] us and not unto the
[1:45:04] world? Then he says in verse
[1:45:06] 23, Jesus answered and said unto him, if
[1:45:10] a man love
[1:45:12] me, he will keep my
[1:45:16] words. Good ground.
[1:45:20] keeps the
[1:45:21] word. You take away the
[1:45:23] thorns, the cares of this
[1:45:26] life. Much as you may have
[1:45:28] cares, but you don't bring them to the
[1:45:31] same level of the word of
[1:45:33] God, put the word of God
[1:45:35] above, and cares
[1:45:38] follow. It's the word of
[1:45:41] God that gives you
[1:45:43] comfort in the midst of the troubles
[1:45:45] that you're going through. In the midst
[1:45:48] of the cars that you're going
[1:45:50] through, praise the name of. So he says,
[1:45:53] "He that loveth
[1:45:55] me, he will keep my
[1:45:58] word. My father will love
[1:46:01] him." That's what he says. If you love
[1:46:04] him, you will keep the word. Good
[1:46:07] ground. You keep the word. You obey the
[1:46:11] word. You think about the word. You
[1:46:14] meditate upon the
[1:46:16] word every day
[1:46:19] daily. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:46:22] have time. And you take time and you
[1:46:25] read your
[1:46:26] Bible and then you are busy reading
[1:46:29] it. Praise the name of the Lord. There's
[1:46:32] somebody who came some years
[1:46:35] ago. Then I said, "But do you really
[1:46:37] love God?
[1:46:39] He said, "Yes." Said, "Are you
[1:46:41] sure? When did you last read your
[1:46:45] Bible?" He told me just a few
[1:46:49] days. Then I asked him, "Do you know
[1:46:51] your
[1:46:52] Bible?" Then I said, "What's the last
[1:46:55] book in the
[1:46:57] Bible?" Then he said,
[1:47:02] "Abraham." Then you know he doesn't know
[1:47:04] his Bible.
[1:47:06] So he thinks that Daniel is a
[1:47:09] book. So even Abra is a
[1:47:13] book he doesn't
[1:47:15] know. Then there's another
[1:47:18] sister gave her the church age
[1:47:21] book after some time then I asked her
[1:47:26] which age are you on? They said I think
[1:47:29] is
[1:47:31] vision. I wondered you have the book.
[1:47:36] you're not reading it.
[1:47:39] And some sometimes that's what most of
[1:47:41] us
[1:47:44] are. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[1:47:47] have the word that doesn't help
[1:47:51] you. And some people think by putting
[1:47:54] the Bible below their
[1:47:58] pillow
[1:48:00] protected. You have this Bible. Put it
[1:48:03] in your heart. That's how it will
[1:48:05] protect you.
[1:48:08] Praise the name of you know people just
[1:48:10] don't have enough time for
[1:48:14] God. They don't have enough time but
[1:48:18] somebody can spend a whole
[1:48:21] night on a movie or on a
[1:48:28] rumor. And you know the televisions have
[1:48:32] dozy gossip corners.
[1:48:36] You know there are shows of
[1:48:42] gossip you had this person and then the
[1:48:45] other
[1:48:45] one and then you are there feeding
[1:48:50] yourself but when it comes the things of
[1:48:53] God they are
[1:48:55] boring. Then he said, "If you love
[1:49:01] me, you will keep my
[1:49:04] words." How do you keep what you don't
[1:49:07] have? You must have it, then you keep
[1:49:11] it. In other words, take time, receive
[1:49:14] the word, read the word, hear the word.
[1:49:19] Now, when you receive it, that's when
[1:49:22] you can keep it.
[1:49:25] Praise the name of our Lord. And then it
[1:49:27] is in your
[1:49:28] heart. Every decision you
[1:49:30] make, the word guides you in the
[1:49:33] decision
[1:49:34] making. The word helps you in everything
[1:49:37] you do.
[1:49:40] You know, just like the scriptures in
[1:49:41] Deuteronomy chapter
[1:49:44] 6, let us go to Deuteronomy chapter
[1:49:47] 6 and read a part of that
[1:49:52] scripture in verse
[1:49:54] four. Here, oh
[1:49:57] Israel, the Lord our God is one
[1:50:02] Lord, and you shall love the Lord with
[1:50:05] thy God with all your heart.
[1:50:10] and with all thy mind, with all your
[1:50:14] soul. Then he says, "And these words
[1:50:17] which I command thee this
[1:50:22] day." Now he's not
[1:50:24] saying the words he's commanded
[1:50:27] you, they be in the
[1:50:31] book. He says, "The words that I command
[1:50:35] you
[1:50:38] Where are they meant to
[1:50:40] be? In your
[1:50:42] heart. The good
[1:50:44] ground. So if that seed, if that word is
[1:50:48] in the
[1:50:50] heart, the good
[1:50:52] ground, what will it to do in verse
[1:50:57] six? Verse seven rather. And you shall
[1:51:00] teach them diligently unto your
[1:51:02] children.
[1:51:07] Like a
[1:51:08] parent, take time, teach your children
[1:51:11] the way of the
[1:51:14] Lord. Don't be too
[1:51:17] busy for your children. Others, you may
[1:51:20] lose
[1:51:21] them. Take time with your family. Show
[1:51:26] them the way of the
[1:51:28] Lord. Be like
[1:51:31] Abraham. Abraham taught his son Isaac.
[1:51:35] the way of the Lord. When he was still
[1:51:38] young until when Isaac was a small
[1:51:41] boy and he was moving with his father
[1:51:43] for
[1:51:45] sacrifice, the father put firewood on
[1:51:48] him. And then he got the knife and then
[1:51:51] the
[1:51:52] fire. And then Isaac asked his
[1:51:55] father, "Father, give the
[1:51:59] firewood and then the fire, where is the
[1:52:02] lamb for
[1:52:05] sacrifice?" Isaac didn't say vision
[1:52:07] about
[1:52:09] that.
[1:52:10] Abraham told
[1:52:12] Isaac that to give a sacrifice to
[1:52:15] God, he need a
[1:52:18] lamb. Praise the name of Lord. He had
[1:52:21] taught him the way of the Lord.
[1:52:24] And that's what the Lord is telling us
[1:52:26] that you should teach your children
[1:52:31] diligently and talk about them when you
[1:52:34] sit in your
[1:52:37] house. Now let us go back home
[1:52:41] now. How much time do you have for God
[1:52:43] at
[1:52:45] home? Praise the name of the Lord. Or
[1:52:48] what governs most of your time at
[1:52:52] home? What governs?
[1:52:55] Is it a television set? Is it a radio?
[1:53:00] Is it a certain
[1:53:02] program? What governs you at
[1:53:06] home? And sometimes at home, everybody's
[1:53:09] on their
[1:53:12] phone and then you start dozing.
[1:53:15] Supper is not yet
[1:53:18] ready. When supper comes, you are too
[1:53:22] heavy. Did you know we have not prayed
[1:53:25] today? Okay, let us pray. One
[1:53:29] minute. Somebody's already
[1:53:33] sleeping. How are you going to talk
[1:53:35] about the word of God at your
[1:53:37] home with a lot of program
[1:53:42] packed? No time for God. And then it
[1:53:45] becomes a
[1:53:47] habit today. So the devil
[1:53:53] says another problem comes in the
[1:53:59] morning and instead of what you should
[1:54:01] have fed on
[1:54:05] yesterday would have helped you the
[1:54:08] following
[1:54:09] day. You know the Bible tells us, let us
[1:54:12] go to Hebrews chapter
[1:54:15] 4. Praise the name of our Lord. Hebrews
[1:54:18] chapter 4.
[1:54:27] And then verse
[1:54:31] 16, the Bible says, "Let us
[1:54:36] therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[1:54:43] grace." The throne of
[1:54:46] grace, you know, things concerning
[1:54:50] God, reading the word,
[1:54:53] praying unto
[1:54:54] God, fasting, hearing the word,
[1:54:58] testifying about the word, sharing about
[1:55:01] the word before the throne of God. Why?
[1:55:06] That we may obtain
[1:55:09] mercy and find
[1:55:13] grace to
[1:55:15] help in the time of need. But you've not
[1:55:18] been before the throne of God.
[1:55:23] the whole
[1:55:25] day, not talking about God, not praying
[1:55:29] about
[1:55:29] God, not testifying about God. So you
[1:55:33] you're not before the presence of
[1:55:35] God. So how are you going to obtain
[1:55:39] mercy and grace to help in the time of
[1:55:43] need and yet mercy is here? Grace is
[1:55:47] here. No time for
[1:55:51] You get
[1:55:53] it? No time for the program of God at
[1:55:59] home. No time for God in your
[1:56:04] life. So trials come and you just
[1:56:08] fought cuz there's nothing to help you
[1:56:10] in that time of
[1:56:12] need. Now if you have taken in
[1:56:15] enough, praise the name of God. When
[1:56:18] such a trial come or temptation or
[1:56:23] persecution, you said, "Look at this one
[1:56:26] here. You just go over it. You'll be
[1:56:29] like Paul, praise the name of you, you
[1:56:33] know, Paul before, you know, when they
[1:56:36] were in the
[1:56:39] ship, the angel of the Lord came and
[1:56:42] told him, "You are all going to be
[1:56:45] delivered." And then he said, you'll
[1:56:48] indeed appear before
[1:56:51] Caesar. And so when this were
[1:56:55] troubled, the people he had hundreds of
[1:56:58] people in the
[1:57:00] ship, you know, they were
[1:57:02] sorrowful and then he encouraged them
[1:57:06] that the angel of the Lord came and
[1:57:07] talked to me at
[1:57:09] night. We are not going to perish. These
[1:57:12] were not eaten for a number of days.
[1:57:16] When he said, "So you cheer up." It
[1:57:18] break. God assured that we all going to
[1:57:21] be but the goods we have are going to be
[1:57:25] lost. So the ship
[1:57:28] broke able to reach the
[1:57:33] island. And now when they reach there,
[1:57:36] those men of the island said,
[1:57:38] "Hey, of course they knew they were
[1:57:40] criminals.
[1:57:45] said, "Hey, this shipwreck with all
[1:57:48] these
[1:57:50] criminals." So now Paul gathered some
[1:57:53] firewood and now when he was lighting a
[1:57:56] fire, a viper came and stuck on
[1:58:00] him and then the people of the island
[1:58:03] said,
[1:58:03] "Hey, this man is a big must be a
[1:58:07] serious criminal
[1:58:10] here. He has survived the
[1:58:12] ocean, but the viper just wants to kill
[1:58:15] him now. So they expecting him to
[1:58:18] die. But what did the supposed to do?
[1:58:22] Just shook it
[1:58:24] off. Grace to help in the time of
[1:58:28] need. Praise the name of because he
[1:58:30] heard from the Lord. And brother say he
[1:58:35] knew that the poison of the
[1:58:38] serpent will do him no harm because he
[1:58:42] was going to meet
[1:58:44] Caesar. Grace to help in the time of
[1:58:47] need. So you need to get time at
[1:58:51] home. Talk about
[1:58:54] God. Speak about his
[1:58:56] goodness. Read the Bible. Praise the
[1:58:59] name of Because the Bible says
[1:59:03] Blessed are
[1:59:04] they when you read in Revelations
[1:59:07] 1:3. Blessed are they that
[1:59:10] read. So just to take time to
[1:59:14] read, you are blessed. Praise the name
[1:59:17] of Lord, just to sit and
[1:59:19] hear. You are
[1:59:21] blessed. And we want to be
[1:59:24] blessed. Why don't you take time and be
[1:59:27] blessed at
[1:59:28] home? The way you have come to church,
[1:59:31] you are
[1:59:33] blessed. And then others will say,
[1:59:39] the blessings can turn away the
[1:59:43] curses. Praise the name of
[1:59:46] blessed. Let us go back to chapter
[1:59:50] 6. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:59:54] Deuteronomy chapter
[1:59:55] 6 and then verse 7.
[1:59:59] He says, "When you sit in thine
[2:00:03] house and when you walk
[2:00:08] away and when you lie
[2:00:11] down and when you rise
[2:00:16] up, how often are meant to talk about
[2:00:18] the word of
[2:00:20] God?" Praise the name of Lord. When I
[2:00:23] sit down, I talk about God. When I rise
[2:00:26] up, I talk about when I'm at my place of
[2:00:30] work, I'm talking about I'm thinking
[2:00:33] about when I lie down talking
[2:00:37] about what are you doing, you are
[2:00:40] getting more of that
[2:00:42] word and so you keep
[2:00:45] it. Praise the name of the Lord. And he
[2:00:48] said when you keep the
[2:00:50] word in John
[2:00:54] 14:23, the Bible says, let us go back to
[2:00:57] John 14:23.
[2:01:05] And my father will love
[2:01:11] him. And we will come unto
[2:01:14] him and make our abode with
[2:01:20] him. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[2:01:23] says we shall make our abode with
[2:01:27] him. That's the baptism of the Holy
[2:01:29] Spirit. How hard is that?
[2:01:32] Praise the name of the Lord because it's
[2:01:34] the spirit of God that has spoken to you
[2:01:37] the
[2:01:38] word. And when you obey that word, then
[2:01:42] that word will bring the same
[2:01:45] spirit will be resident in your
[2:01:49] heart. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[2:01:52] it's not
[2:01:53] far. It's about obeying the
[2:01:57] word, believing the word. And then you
[2:02:01] see the word will have effect upon your
[2:02:05] life. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[2:02:08] the Bible says that the word of
[2:02:13] God is
[2:02:15] quick. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[2:02:18] us go to the book of
[2:02:20] Hebrews. Hebrews chapter
[2:02:27] 4. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:02:33] the book of
[2:02:39] Hebrews. Let me get the scripture
[2:02:49] here. Hebrews chapter 4 and then verse
[2:02:56] 12. It says, "For the word of God is
[2:03:07] quick and sharper." Okay. Quick and
[2:03:10] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[2:03:13] sword, piercing even the dividing asand
[2:03:16] of soul and spirit and of joints and
[2:03:19] marrow. And is a discerner of the
[2:03:20] thoughts and intents of the heart.
[2:03:44] Praise the name of our Lord. So the word
[2:03:46] of God is
[2:03:48] quick. So he says the word quick means
[2:03:51] it is alive.
[2:03:55] That word
[2:03:56] [Music]
[2:03:58] quick, you know, it is
[2:04:01] alive. In other words, it has
[2:04:06] life. When God said, "Let there
[2:04:10] be." It had to come to
[2:04:13] pass. So even to us, when God says, "Let
[2:04:17] there be love in your
[2:04:20] life." And then you receive that word
[2:04:23] in your heart and you obey that
[2:04:27] word love will come to
[2:04:29] pass it will become a
[2:04:32] manifestation not be something you know
[2:04:35] say I don't know I can work on
[2:04:39] this just allow the word to come in the
[2:04:41] heart and then you see the manifestation
[2:04:44] come
[2:04:45] forth that's what the scripture is
[2:04:47] saying the word of God is
[2:04:51] quick is
[2:04:53] alive. And when it is alive, the Bible
[2:04:56] says it is
[2:04:59] powerful. It is
[2:05:01] powerful. If it is the word of
[2:05:05] love, the power in that word of
[2:05:08] love will bring hatred
[2:05:11] down. Praise the name of Allah. And then
[2:05:14] love will be
[2:05:15] manifested. The fruit of the spirit will
[2:05:19] become so real in your life.
[2:05:22] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[2:05:24] to be obedient to the
[2:05:26] word. Be obedient to the
[2:05:29] word and then the Holy Spirit speaks to
[2:05:33] us the word of God. We need to be
[2:05:35] obedient to the word of
[2:05:37] God. The word
[2:05:40] himself will be manifested in our
[2:05:43] lives. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[2:05:46] in the message the greatest battle ever
[2:05:49] fought brother Brandham says he
[2:05:53] says what do you do
[2:05:55] then take the
[2:05:58] word what is the word the Bible say here
[2:06:03] we just read it for the
[2:06:07] spirit and of
[2:06:09] God is the word see and take the helmet
[2:06:14] of salvation
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:19] And the
[2:06:20] sword, the sword of the
[2:06:22] spirit, the sword of the
[2:06:25] spirit, what?
[2:06:27] The spirit that comes in through your
[2:06:32] mind and enters into
[2:06:34] you. And the sword of that
[2:06:38] spirit is the word of
[2:06:42] God. Praise the name of the Lord. like
[2:06:45] our Lord Jesus Christ when he was being
[2:06:48] tempted, you know, he was
[2:06:51] hungry and then the devil says stones
[2:06:54] are here. Make them bread. What did he
[2:06:58] say? Man shall not live by bread
[2:07:01] alone, but by every word that proceeds
[2:07:05] out of the mouth
[2:07:06] of. So it was the sword of the
[2:07:10] spirit which is the word of
[2:07:13] God to defeat that
[2:07:15] temptation. And we can do also the same
[2:07:17] thing in our
[2:07:18] lives. But then how are you going to
[2:07:20] defeat
[2:07:21] Satan when you don't know the word of
[2:07:24] God? You don't know anything. Maybe you
[2:07:27] know some things which are contrary.
[2:07:30] And Satan will take you as a
[2:07:33] captive because you've not heard the
[2:07:35] word of
[2:07:36] God. And then he says, "What does the
[2:07:39] spirit fight
[2:07:41] with? What does the spirit fight
[2:07:44] with?
[2:07:47] Sensations,
[2:07:49] feelings, the
[2:07:51] word, heart, glory, what does it fight
[2:07:57] with?
[2:07:59] Feeling no word. Word. Then he says,
[2:08:04] "Let us say
[2:08:05] word. Word." Word of God is what the
[2:08:10] spirit fights
[2:08:13] with. Praise the name of the sword of
[2:08:17] the
[2:08:17] spirit. The word of God. So you see that
[2:08:21] the spirit of
[2:08:22] God because we are talking about the
[2:08:26] swer is the Holy Spirit.
[2:08:29] And what that the Holy Spirit
[2:08:31] saw the seed. What is the seed is the
[2:08:36] word. And then he says praise the name
[2:08:39] of our Lord. The sword of the spirit is
[2:08:43] the word of God. So you cannot
[2:08:46] say I have received the word of
[2:08:49] God. And if it is under a right
[2:08:52] condition of the
[2:08:56] heart, the word of
[2:08:59] God has become alive in
[2:09:01] you. Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[2:09:04] need to see that we check our
[2:09:07] hearts in the message. The spoken word
[2:09:09] is the original
[2:09:11] seed. He says, "What is the seed of
[2:09:15] life?" The word of God. Therefore for
[2:09:19] life you cannot come through a
[2:09:23] creed. You cannot come through a
[2:09:26] denomination. You got to come back to
[2:09:28] the
[2:09:30] word. The seed of life. His
[2:09:35] word is his seed and his spirit is the
[2:09:40] water. Jesus is the word of God.
[2:09:44] and was busted
[2:09:46] open. That
[2:09:48] life, the life inside the
[2:09:52] sea, that's this
[2:09:54] life which is
[2:09:57] spirit, water flowing
[2:10:00] over, the spirit over the
[2:10:05] seed, the seed of God will bring forth
[2:10:09] the life of God.
[2:10:12] Praise the name of God. So we need to
[2:10:15] allow the spirit of God to speak to
[2:10:18] us and then the same
[2:10:21] spirit to release the
[2:10:23] rain which is the same spirit. What is
[2:10:27] it doing? It's the spirit following the
[2:10:31] word he has spoken to
[2:10:33] you to make it alive in our life. The
[2:10:37] swer is the holy spirit.
[2:10:40] So what do you do? You open your heart
[2:10:42] to the
[2:10:43] soul. And when he sws, he follows what
[2:10:47] he has
[2:10:48] saw to make it alive. Praise the name of
[2:10:51] our Lord. Then we can become the
[2:10:55] manifestation of that same word of
[2:10:59] God. Praise the name of our Lord. In the
[2:11:02] book of Luke
[2:11:05] 10:25, the scripture
[2:11:07] says, "And behold, a certain lawyer
[2:11:10] stood up and tempted him, saying,
[2:11:12] Master, what shall I do to inherit
[2:11:15] eternal life?
[2:11:27] He said unto him, "What is written in
[2:11:30] the
[2:11:31] law, how do you read?" And he answering
[2:11:35] said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[2:11:38] with all your
[2:11:41] heart, and with all thy soul, and with
[2:11:44] all thy strength, and with all thy mind,
[2:11:48] and thy neighbor as thyself."
[2:11:52] And he said unto him, "Thou hast
[2:11:55] answered
[2:11:57] right, this do and you shall
[2:12:01] live." This is a very interesting story.
[2:12:04] A lawyer came to tempt
[2:12:07] him. How can I have eternal life? Then
[2:12:10] Jesus asks him, "What does what is
[2:12:14] written in the
[2:12:15] law? How do you read?" Then he told him,
[2:12:19] he reported to him. What is Jesus
[2:12:21] telling him? You know it what you need
[2:12:24] to do. Do it and you shall live. In
[2:12:29] other words, what you know, allow it to
[2:12:33] govern your
[2:12:34] life. Praise the name of Lord. Allow the
[2:12:38] seed that has been sown in
[2:12:40] you to influence your
[2:12:44] thoughts, your decision
[2:12:48] making. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:12:50] Allow it to influence your decision
[2:12:55] making. You know the word of God says
[2:12:58] this. So you'll not go by your
[2:13:02] enticement. The things that are pleasant
[2:13:05] unto you.
[2:13:07] But what does the word of God say about
[2:13:11] this? So it influences your
[2:13:14] decisions. And you see the word of
[2:13:17] God. Praise the name of the Lord. It
[2:13:20] should be able to influence our human
[2:13:25] spirit. Like the human spirit has got
[2:13:28] five
[2:13:30] senses. He has the sense of affection.
[2:13:35] He has the sense of
[2:13:38] consciousness. He has the sense of know
[2:13:42] memory has the sense of
[2:13:46] imagination and he has the sense of
[2:13:50] reasoning. Now if the word of
[2:13:54] God has taken a hold of your
[2:13:57] life, it will affect your affections.
[2:14:04] your
[2:14:05] affection like
[2:14:07] David, the word of
[2:14:09] God had taken a hold of his
[2:14:12] life. Then he said, I was glad when they
[2:14:17] said unto
[2:14:19] me, let us go into the house of God.
[2:14:22] That was an affection.
[2:14:26] And then he
[2:14:27] testified I would rather be a domat in
[2:14:30] the house of
[2:14:32] God than stay in
[2:14:35] palises. But it's a man who was in the
[2:14:37] palace but the affection he
[2:14:40] had. He desired to be in the
[2:14:43] present. So now the word takes a hold of
[2:14:47] you. It affects your desires.
[2:14:53] It affects your
[2:14:57] delight. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:14:59] When I was listening to radio program
[2:15:01] this
[2:15:02] morning and then they were announc
[2:15:05] making announcements before airing our
[2:15:06] radio
[2:15:08] program and then in the news then they
[2:15:11] said today there is
[2:15:15] premiership said is it around 3 or four
[2:15:17] or
[2:15:18] five and then they talked about the
[2:15:20] teams which are going to
[2:15:22] play and now when we were coming from
[2:15:26] home we had a a coaster
[2:15:30] There was a coaster passing by us and
[2:15:33] then another tax and then they had flags
[2:15:37] outside. Then we're wondering then my
[2:15:40] wife said, "Hey, can you imagine this is
[2:15:42] Manchester
[2:15:43] United? Manchester United Manchester
[2:15:50] United brainwashed
[2:15:53] instead of if they had a flag of Ugandan
[2:15:55] team you would say but something which
[2:15:57] is far from
[2:16:03] you and some of them can even tell from
[2:16:06] number one to number
[2:16:09] 11. Today we are going to fill this
[2:16:13] one. Are you part of the decision makers
[2:16:15] in Europe
[2:16:17] then? But saying
[2:16:20] that because of the affection of the
[2:16:24] game the other we bought him a lot of
[2:16:29] money but when half time we are going to
[2:16:33] change affection.
[2:16:39] He loves football because he loves
[2:16:41] football very
[2:16:43] much. He knows number one the
[2:16:46] goalkeeper. He knows number 11. Knows
[2:16:49] number five. He knows how many players
[2:16:52] can play number
[2:16:53] four. And he can tell even the name.
[2:16:57] This is our best goal. This is our best
[2:17:00] scorer. You know they have even given
[2:17:02] him number 20 as permanent number of
[2:17:06] his. Even if he dies that number remains
[2:17:09] in his
[2:17:11] name,
[2:17:14] perfection. So he knows everything into
[2:17:17] it
[2:17:19] there. But then ask him, hey, can you
[2:17:22] give me a scripture in the
[2:17:25] Bible? Then he starts looking on the
[2:17:28] phone. No
[2:17:31] affection. But
[2:17:33] football even knows how much the coach
[2:17:35] is paid.
[2:17:39] He knows the sitting
[2:17:43] capacium. He knows all those
[2:17:48] details. If you really have affection
[2:17:50] for the message of the
[2:17:54] hour, they ask you a
[2:17:58] question. Hey
[2:18:00] brother, what are the gifts that God
[2:18:03] gave
[2:18:03] him? Then you start wondering I don't
[2:18:07] know what he's talking
[2:18:09] about. And then you say you have
[2:18:12] affection. You love the message of the
[2:18:15] hour. You don't know the
[2:18:17] messenger. You don't know the things God
[2:18:19] used him to
[2:18:21] do. You start wondering. But that one,
[2:18:24] you don't read it in
[2:18:26] history. You don't get them
[2:18:30] there.
[2:18:32] Affection. And so the affection that you
[2:18:37] have, it influences your
[2:18:44] consciousness. I'm
[2:18:47] conscious this thing may not
[2:18:51] happen. You know, do you know that the
[2:18:53] other footballer became sick and
[2:18:57] so you have affection in those
[2:18:59] things? They are so much engraved in
[2:19:02] your
[2:19:03] spirit. So even reasoning you about
[2:19:07] that. Maybe you are dreaming at night
[2:19:10] the memories about
[2:19:14] football
[2:19:16] affection. But we need to put there the
[2:19:18] word of
[2:19:19] God. Praise the name of. So Jesus asked
[2:19:23] this
[2:19:24] lawyer these things. Go and do them. Be
[2:19:28] obedient to them.
[2:19:30] and you shall live. Praise the name of
[2:19:33] our Lord. So we need to see that we
[2:19:36] allow the spirit of
[2:19:39] God. Praise the name of our Lord as the
[2:19:41] word is spoken to
[2:19:43] us. Let us be obedient to the word. Then
[2:19:48] the spirit comes and gives that word
[2:19:52] life and you become a manifested word of
[2:19:56] God.
[2:19:59] Praise the name of our Lord. In 2
[2:20:02] Corinthians chapter
[2:20:04] 3, the scripture
[2:20:07] says verse
[2:20:09] two, you are our epistles written in our
[2:20:13] hearts, known and read of all men.
[2:20:17] 2 Corinthians 3:2.
[2:20:32] For as much as you are man manifestedly
[2:20:34] declared to be epistles of Christ,
[2:20:37] minister to us written not with ink, but
[2:20:41] with the spirit of the living God, not
[2:20:44] in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables
[2:20:48] of the heart.
[2:21:09] praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[2:21:12] it is the
[2:21:14] spirit that has written this
[2:21:17] epistle and it's not written on the
[2:21:20] tables of
[2:21:22] stone maybe like in this book but what
[2:21:26] is in the book which we have heard the
[2:21:29] holy spirit speak to
[2:21:31] us the holy spirit
[2:21:33] himself who has sown the word has
[2:21:37] written it in our
[2:21:38] heart. So it influences your
[2:21:42] decision. It influences your
[2:21:45] speech. You're not going to be negative
[2:21:48] all the
[2:21:50] time. No. Once the word is
[2:21:53] inside, it's the word you're going to be
[2:21:57] speaking. The Bible says this. The
[2:22:00] message says this. Praise the name of
[2:22:03] the other time I was in
[2:22:05] Zimbabwe. I was so
[2:22:07] challenged that even a person in
[2:22:11] church, not even a minister, but they
[2:22:14] are telling you what brother Brandham
[2:22:16] says about an
[2:22:19] issue. How about
[2:22:21] us? How often do we take time to read
[2:22:23] our message
[2:22:25] book? We have read
[2:22:30] available. But then have you taken time
[2:22:33] to read the things?
[2:22:36] Have you taken time to hear the voice of
[2:22:38] the
[2:22:40] prophet? So he says the
[2:22:42] spirit has written the word on the
[2:22:45] tables of our
[2:22:47] heart. And now when the word of God is
[2:22:50] written in the tables of our
[2:22:53] heart, it makes us live the life of the
[2:22:58] word. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[2:23:01] become the manifestation of the word of
[2:23:03] God.
[2:23:05] Why? Because you have allowed the Holy
[2:23:08] Spirit to take charge over your life. So
[2:23:12] you are no longer living
[2:23:14] yourself, but it is the Holy
[2:23:18] Spirit in you. Praise the name of our
[2:23:21] Lord that is displaying
[2:23:23] himself. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:23:26] Let us conclude because I see time is
[2:23:29] going. Let us go to Galatians chapter 5.
[2:23:34] The Bible says, "But the fruit of the
[2:23:37] spirit is love, joy, peace,
[2:23:42] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[2:23:45] faith, meekness, temperance. Against
[2:23:49] such there is no
[2:23:51] law 5 22 Galatians 5:22.
[2:24:13] He says the fruit of the
[2:24:18] spirit. But if it is a
[2:24:20] fruit, there has to be a
[2:24:23] [Music]
[2:24:24] seed. And what is the
[2:24:26] seed? The word of God.
[2:24:29] Who sows the seed? The ser. And what
[2:24:32] fruit do you
[2:24:34] manifest? The fruit of the
[2:24:37] swer. The Holy Spirit. So he says the
[2:24:41] fruit of the
[2:24:42] spirit. So how can you bear the
[2:24:45] fruit without receiving from the
[2:24:49] s? Praise the name of our lord. So we
[2:24:51] allow the sower, the Holy Spirit to sow
[2:24:57] himself in us. Praise the name of our
[2:25:01] Lord. And as he sows himself in
[2:25:04] us by the word of
[2:25:06] God, we manifest the spirit of
[2:25:10] God, the fruit of the
[2:25:13] spirit. And the Bible says the fruit of
[2:25:15] the
[2:25:17] spirit not your fruit but his
[2:25:21] fruit. Praise the name of our Lord. What
[2:25:24] you do? Lord I surrender
[2:25:27] myself. Lord I yield
[2:25:29] myself and then he bears his
[2:25:32] fruit in you. Praise the name of you
[2:25:37] take his
[2:25:39] identity. You bear his
[2:25:42] nature. You bear his
[2:25:44] name. Praise the name of Christ living
[2:25:48] in
[2:25:49] us. The fruit of the
[2:25:52] spirit. Where does he bear his fruit? In
[2:25:55] us. Just having our hearts to
[2:25:58] him. Then he bears his
[2:26:01] fruit. He sws the seed. He quickens the
[2:26:05] seed. and then the seed manifest the
[2:26:09] life of the spirit of
[2:26:11] God. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[2:26:15] just as we said that the swer is the
[2:26:17] holy
[2:26:19] spirit, we also need to know that Satan
[2:26:23] is also a
[2:26:25] ser. You need to be
[2:26:28] careful which seed are you
[2:26:31] receiving. There are two
[2:26:35] sers like in that
[2:26:37] parable in Matthew chapter
[2:26:40] 13. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[2:26:43] read it and so we can
[2:26:46] finish. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:26:50] Matthew chapter 13 and then
[2:26:52] verse 24.
[2:26:57] And another par put forth them, saying,
[2:27:01] "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a
[2:27:03] man which sowed good seed in his
[2:27:11] field. But while men
[2:27:14] slept, the enemy came and saw tears
[2:27:19] among the
[2:27:22] wheat and went away.
[2:27:26] two sers
[2:27:28] Christ and Satan.
[2:27:32] So who s who who is sowing in our
[2:27:34] hearts?
[2:27:36] What seed are we
[2:27:38] receiving? And you know the principle of
[2:27:40] the
[2:27:41] seed is every
[2:27:44] seed shall bring after his
[2:27:48] kind. What seed are you
[2:27:51] receiving? When you receive the seed of
[2:27:53] hatred,
[2:27:56] You'll manifest
[2:27:57] hatred. When you receive the seed of
[2:28:00] love, you'll manifest
[2:28:03] love. Whatever seed that is
[2:28:06] sown must come to
[2:28:09] maturity must come to
[2:28:12] manifestation. So what seed are we
[2:28:15] receiving? Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:28:18] So any seed that is contrary to the word
[2:28:20] of
[2:28:23] God is of the devil. So we need to avoid
[2:28:27] the seeds of
[2:28:29] Satan. And the most unfortunate
[2:28:33] thing most of our
[2:28:36] time we are in
[2:28:40] interface Satan
[2:28:42] sowing at the place of work. people
[2:28:47] abusive, people doing funny
[2:28:49] things. Satan is sowing on the
[2:28:54] roads. Satan is sowing through naked
[2:28:59] women through bad
[2:29:02] adverts. He's
[2:29:04] sowing people here
[2:29:06] fighting sowing. Satan is sowing. Most
[2:29:10] of the
[2:29:13] day we are being exposed to Satan
[2:29:18] sowing. That's why you need
[2:29:21] time to have the Holy Spirit to sew in
[2:29:24] your seed.
[2:29:26] Praise the name of our Lord in your
[2:29:28] heart and you know get time that some of
[2:29:32] these wicked seeds that have been swn
[2:29:34] around the
[2:29:37] day traveling your mind tring your heart
[2:29:42] allow them to be washed
[2:29:44] away. Allow them to be
[2:29:47] plucked that they don't influence your
[2:29:49] decision
[2:29:50] making that they don't influence your
[2:29:53] life that they don't influence
[2:29:56] how you
[2:29:57] speak. If the other people are
[2:30:00] abusive, why do you involve yourself
[2:30:03] in the other people are rumor mongering?
[2:30:07] Why do you involve yourself in those
[2:30:09] things? You
[2:30:10] avoid all those evil seeds being
[2:30:14] sown. So you avoid Satan sowing those
[2:30:17] dirty seeds in your
[2:30:20] heart. Consecrate yourselves to the
[2:30:23] Lord.
[2:30:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Give
[2:30:27] yourself all your
[2:30:29] life and just give it to the Lord.
[2:30:32] Praise the name of Lord and take the
[2:30:34] Lord to allow the Lord to govern all
[2:30:36] your
[2:30:38] life, your decision making, your speech
[2:30:43] and your life. And it starts by changing
[2:30:45] your
[2:30:46] mind. Then it changes your
[2:30:49] testimony or your test your what you
[2:30:52] speak your confession and then your life
[2:30:55] will be
[2:30:57] changed written a piece of red of all
[2:31:00] men. May God bless
[2:31:02] you. Amen.
[2:31:05] Amen. As the song leader
[2:31:08] comes there's that song that says we are
