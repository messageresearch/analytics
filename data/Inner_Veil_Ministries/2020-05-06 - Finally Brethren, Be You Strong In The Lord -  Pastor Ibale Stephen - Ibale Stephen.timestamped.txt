[1:14] devil is
[1:22] not against flesh and blood but against
[1:26] principalities against Powers against
[1:29] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:32] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:34] places
[1:52] withstand the devil that even the in the
[1:56] evil day and having done all to start
[2:08] foreign
[2:45] ERS of the wicked
[2:55] is
[3:03] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[3:06] which is the word of God is
[3:15] praying always with our prayer and
[3:17] supplication in the spirit and watching
[3:20] there unto with all perseverance and
[3:23] supplication for All Saints
[3:36] foreign
[4:02] finally Brethren be strong in the Lord
[4:05] now
[4:09] that's the subject we are going to deal

[4:24] be strong
[4:29] now the scripture doesn't say
[4:32] be strong for the Lord
[4:37] but be strong in the Lord
[4:41] you have to be in the Lord
[4:44] in order for you to be strong
[4:48] you cannot be strong for the Lord

[5:03] after everything has been done
[5:07] the Holy Spirit has sealed you in the
[5:10] body of Christ
[5:13] to be strong in the Lord
[5:17] yeah because
[5:19] you know Paul sees anybody coming up
[5:26] and then he wants the Christian to
[5:29] divorce not unwavering trust in the Lord
[5:35] so a Christian therefore must know the
[5:39] source of his armor
[5:43] and his might never is not the Christian
[5:48] strength
[5:50] but dependence on the finished work of
[5:54] Calvary
[5:57] amen amen you cannot be strong outside
[6:00] of the Lord
[6:06] be strong in the Lord
[6:10] you see if we are talking about being

[7:10] and the strength
[7:12] is the strength in the Lord
[7:17] amen and then he says

[48:02] Bible calls it wild
[48:05] in the end times
[48:07] it's time to deal with pressure
[48:14] and yet this pressure here
[48:17] will as well help us to be raptured out
[48:20] of here
[48:22] when the plan is going to take off
[48:24] [Applause]
[48:26] it has to be pressurized
[48:35] it has to be
[48:36] used
[48:41] Is pressurizing Us
[48:46] you just find like you don't want to
[48:48] stay here anymore
[48:50] because
[48:52] the wires of the enemy are becoming more
[48:55] and more
[48:57] but over now anointed
[49:01] to come down in a fashion World okay
[49:07] and then you are pressurized
[49:11] you'll find you bought a dress about two
[49:14] years ago
[49:17] but that dress does not come to the
[49:20] standard anymore
[49:26] sometimes to get a new fashion and said
[49:29] everything
[49:30] and sometimes that new fashion
[49:34] does not speak well in the world
[49:40] you get all this kind of pooping
[49:44] and then you have to open a little bit
[49:46] of your bus
[49:48] and then you need to make a dress
[49:52] you know these days
[49:57] the pastor says
[50:04] but then this dress is too loose
[50:15] that when the wind comes
[50:22] you see it's a problem
[50:26] it's pressure it's wireless
[50:33] it's the wise of the enemies
[50:39] and right now
[50:40] we can realize
[50:43] with that we are under pressure
[50:47] the Bible says the wives
[50:51] Music World anybody
[51:03] and it designs the thinking of the
[51:06] people
[51:10] The Wiles of the enemies
[51:14] anointing men
[51:17] so that they can take control of the
[51:22] spirits of the people
[51:24] today the most popular people in the
[51:28] world musicians
[51:33] everywhere in the world
[51:36] president president
[51:38] are trying to reach
[51:40] and bring these men
[51:43] under their control
[51:46] because they speak
[51:48] and you dance to what they are saying
[51:51] everybody
[51:55] you understand what I mean while they
[51:58] speak you dance
[51:59] but when the president speaks
[52:07] and then before even he says anything
[52:14] foreign
[52:53] the power of music amen again those are
[52:57] wires

[54:35] voice from Africa
[54:37] the power of music a man again the Wilds
[54:44] you see that everybody knows standing
[54:47] what he's going to do
[54:49] amen amen but then the scripture says
[54:57] he may be able to stand against the
[55:00] walls
[55:07] it's not what you see
[55:10] but it's some kind of invisible effects
[55:16] of things that are happening around here
[55:25] and for you to overcome this is
[55:34] Judge everything that comes your way
[55:41] ready man I may not listen now what is
[55:45] something this is the manager Noni
[55:47] manager of the Beatles
[55:52] okay you can call them

[56:43] The Beatles
[56:47] foreign
[57:01] [Music]
[57:10] and they've taken over the world
[57:16] if a man comes up and just becomes
[57:26] but when it comes
[57:32] foreign
[57:50] they've taken over the world this is as
[57:53] if they founded a new religion
[57:56] they are corporate antichrists
[58:00] and I mean antichristers and I mean they
[58:04] are so Antichrist they shock me and that
[58:07] went against that whatever
[58:10] but I'm obsessed with them
[58:15] isn't everybody
[58:18] I'm obsessed with the honesty
[58:22] and the people who like the most
[58:26] people should have out been outraged the
[58:30] most
[58:37] in Australia for example
[58:39] Australia each time we arrive at an
[58:42] airport
[58:44] it was as if the goal had landed
[58:48] the goal was the a great
[58:52] challenge I mean French president
[58:57] but better yet the Messiah
[59:02] amen The Roots were lined solid let me
[59:07] see darling at the roots
[59:25] as if to touch one of the boys would
[59:28] make them well again
[59:37] all the women stood watching
[59:42] with their grandchildren as if we as we
[59:46] pass by neighbors
[59:48] I could look see the look on their faces
[59:56] foreign
[1:00:01] [Music]

[1:00:47] and then this man says the last thing is
[1:00:51] to go out on a healing Tower
[1:00:58] I was seeing
[1:01:02] Bobby
[1:01:09] [Applause]
[1:01:19] he's in prison
[1:01:21] and the whole world is on demonstration
[1:01:24] who knows
[1:01:29] America America London London everywhere
[1:01:32] the power of music
[1:01:38] the power man when it's going anywhere
[1:01:41] he starts to musical like this
[1:01:53] what is he giving them
[1:01:56] those are wires
[1:02:01] and now they take control of the people
[1:02:06] and the young people can have been taken
[1:02:10] by the Wilds
[1:02:17] are you hearing what I'm saying

[1:24:13] is
[1:24:14] what the Lord was speaking about
