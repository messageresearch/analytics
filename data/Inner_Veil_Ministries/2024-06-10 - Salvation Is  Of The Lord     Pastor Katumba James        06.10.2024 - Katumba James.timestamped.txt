[56:36] 2 and then we're reading from verse 1 to
[56:39] verse
[56:43] 10 the Bible
[56:45] says then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his
[56:49] God out of the fishes
[56:54] B and said I cried by reason of my
[56:59] Affliction unto the
[57:03] Lord and he heard
[57:07] me out of the belly of Hell cried
[57:12] I and th hardest my

[57:44] yet will I look again toward thy Holy
[57:48] Temple the wat compassed about
[57:53] me even to the soul
[57:56] the Dos closed me round
[58:01] about the weeds were wrapped about my
[58:07] head I went down to the bottoms of the
[58:16] mountain the Earth with her was about me

[58:47] Temple they that observe lying
[58:52] vanities forsake their own Mercy

[59:00] of
[59:04] Thanksgiving I'll pay that I have
[59:08] V salvation is of the
[59:11] Lord and the Lord spoke unto the
[59:15] fish and vomited out
[59:19] Jonah upon the dry
[59:21] ground may God of his words you may be
[59:25] seated
[59:27] praise the name of our Lord so I want to
[59:29] preach about salvation EAS of the
[59:35] Lord praise the name of our Lord
[59:38] salvation is of the
[59:42] Lord praise the name of our Lord at
[59:45] least as you come to the service
[59:48] today have that taken in your
[59:52] heart praise the name of the Lord that
[59:55] your
[59:57] Sal is
[59:59] all the work of the
[1:00:02] Lord praise the name of our Lord your
[1:00:06] salvation is all the work of the
[1:00:10] Lord praise the name of our Lord that
[1:00:13] should sink
[1:00:16] deep such that you know in whatever
[1:00:19] situation you may find yourself
[1:00:22] in it may be a a circumstance you don't
[1:00:27] understand you know as we live in this
[1:00:30] life we are
[1:00:34] limited praise the name of our Lord
[1:00:36] there are many things we don't
[1:00:38] know there are many things we don't
[1:00:42] understand there are many things we
[1:00:44] don't
[1:00:45] see the greatest the reality is the
[1:00:50] reality which we know is the smallest
[1:00:56] and what we don't know is the
[1:00:59] greatest praise the name of our Lord you
[1:01:02] know I think it was last
[1:01:05] year and then last year there were some
[1:01:10] tourists and then there's a man who made
[1:01:13] some kind of thing I'm forgetting how
[1:01:14] they called
[1:01:17] it but it was kind of like a speci
[1:01:22] craft rather water craft
[1:01:26] and then he made that kind of
[1:01:29] craft kind of like a
[1:01:33] vehicle you know and then he put in it
[1:01:37] everything and then he said people
[1:01:39] should pay I think was $1
[1:01:44] million and so people about five people
[1:01:49] pay they paid and then they were going
[1:01:52] to wear the Titanic ship of what kind
[1:01:56] ofed in that
[1:02:00] ocean just to look at
[1:02:03] it so he made this thing he was the
[1:02:07] pilot and then they
[1:02:10] went but now when they reached the under
[1:02:14] the
[1:02:15] SE there was I think it was called an
[1:02:20] implosion you know something to blow up
[1:02:22] from within
[1:02:26] because of the pressure from the
[1:02:29] water itself inside wouldn't
[1:02:34] stand and they all
[1:02:36] perished and then they were writing
[1:02:38] about that and they
[1:02:41] said that the Sea
[1:02:48] World very
[1:02:52] little which is known by man
[1:02:56] they said there's too much
[1:03:00] there until you know they just don't
[1:03:03] know
[1:03:04] much now you can imagine how the Lord
[1:03:07] has made so many
[1:03:11] things praise the name of our Lord and
[1:03:13] then here the Bible is telling us that
[1:03:17] salvation is of the Lord praise the name
[1:03:21] of the Lord you see that Adam and Eve in
[1:03:23] the Garden of Eden
[1:03:27] you know when they went and ate of the
[1:03:31] fruit they came to awareness that they
[1:03:34] were
[1:03:36] naked and now when they knew that they
[1:03:39] were
[1:03:40] naked in Genesis chapter 3 then they saw
[1:03:44] fig lives around their
[1:03:47] bodies and now when Adam had the voice
[1:03:51] of God walking in the garden
[1:03:57] they hid
[1:03:58] themselves but they had got fig leaves
[1:04:01] around
[1:04:03] themselves because they felt that they
[1:04:05] were
[1:04:06] naked it came to their understanding
[1:04:09] that they were
[1:04:11] naked now when they had God
[1:04:14] walking that's when they
[1:04:17] realized that the figs that put around
[1:04:21] themselves were not sufficient covering
[1:04:27] so they hid in the leaves again in the
[1:04:32] trees hiding against
[1:04:35] what praise the name of the Lord because
[1:04:37] it was only Adam and Eve in the
[1:04:40] Gard but they were
[1:04:42] hiding and you see now you look at a
[1:04:46] situation a woman lives
[1:04:51] home with body tight
[1:04:57] so you see all her
[1:04:59] figure she's walking on the
[1:05:02] street that's blindness of
[1:05:07] Satan they live home with bedroom
[1:05:12] clothes or bathroom
[1:05:16] clothes tight things transparent things
[1:05:20] and then they're afraid to walk on the
[1:05:22] streets so it's blindness
[1:05:26] until there is no
[1:05:29] shame but then now in the Garden of
[1:05:33] Eden they they knew they were
[1:05:36] naked and they tried to cover
[1:05:40] themselves and then brother Bram
[1:05:42] teaches that the
[1:05:45] Fig is a form of
[1:05:49] [Music]
[1:05:52] religion like
[1:05:54] people want to belong to a
[1:05:58] religion I belong to this religion I
[1:06:01] blame to this religion I blame to this
[1:06:03] religion and some of them when you talk
[1:06:05] about
[1:06:07] them about
[1:06:08] salvation they say this is my father's
[1:06:12] religion this is my mother's
[1:06:14] religion you know it's your
[1:06:17] fathers your mothers how about you you
[1:06:21] have to make your own
[1:06:23] decision praise the name of our Lord and
[1:06:26] this is our family
[1:06:28] religion God demands each and every one
[1:06:30] of
[1:06:31] us to make a personal
[1:06:35] decision about your personal
[1:06:39] walk with Christ praise the name of our
[1:06:42] Lord so now
[1:06:44] Adam their religion was not
[1:06:48] enough to remove their
[1:06:51] nakedness even now
[1:06:53] religion is not enough
[1:06:56] to bring
[1:06:57] Salvation praise the name of our Lord
[1:07:00] our
[1:07:01] works are not enough to bring our
[1:07:05] Salvation our Good
[1:07:07] Conduct is not enough to bring our
[1:07:11] Salvation whatever we do is not enough
[1:07:15] to bring our salvation Salvation is all
[1:07:19] of the
[1:07:21] Lord praise the name of our Lord It's
[1:07:23] the Lord that works that salvation in
[1:07:26] your so now God had to
[1:07:30] find you know then when he reached the
[1:07:32] place of
[1:07:34] Fellowship you know where they were
[1:07:36] meant to
[1:07:37] congregate because they were meeting at
[1:07:39] the every
[1:07:41] evening in the co of the day now when he
[1:07:44] goes to
[1:07:45] church when he goes to the place of
[1:07:48] Fellowship he wouldn't get Adam there
[1:07:51] you don't get Eve there it's also the
[1:07:54] same thing for us
[1:07:56] God comes to the place of Fellowship but
[1:08:01] then when he comes will he find you
[1:08:04] there will he find you in your
[1:08:07] position praise the name of our Lord or
[1:08:10] you would have
[1:08:11] excuses or you have programs
[1:08:14] to or I'm busy today I have this kind of
[1:08:18] activity
[1:08:19] today but God brother brandham teaches
[1:08:23] us that Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] he keeps his
[1:08:29] appointments when he said where two or
[1:08:31] three are gathered in my
[1:08:34] name I will be there in the minut but
[1:08:37] then the question is where he has
[1:08:40] appointed to meet
[1:08:42] us will you will he find you
[1:08:45] there praise the name of our Lord then
[1:08:48] the Bible says will he find you so
[1:08:53] doing praise the name of our Lord
[1:08:56] So Adam they were running away from the
[1:08:59] presence of
[1:09:00] God until God said
[1:09:04] Adam where are
[1:09:06] you and then said now we are here we are
[1:09:09] hiding
[1:09:10] ourselves we are afraid of
[1:09:13] you Adam praise the name of the
[1:09:17] Lord Adam was very
[1:09:20] sincere and that's how we approach to
[1:09:23] God
[1:09:25] sincere when you come before the
[1:09:27] presence of
[1:09:28] God Lord I'm
[1:09:31] naked Lord I was afraid of
[1:09:34] you at least God had his
[1:09:38] voice how about your voice is God
[1:09:41] hearing your voice about the condition
[1:09:44] you are in this
[1:09:45] morning about the things you're going
[1:09:48] through in this
[1:09:49] morning about the things that are
[1:09:51] troubling you
[1:09:52] today you tell Lord this is my problem
[1:09:56] Lord this is my trouble Lord this is my
[1:10:00] weakness Adam
[1:10:02] confessed Lord let us go to Genesis
[1:10:05] chapter
[1:10:07] 3 praise the name of our
[1:10:09] Lord Genesis chapter
[1:10:13] 3 and then
[1:10:17] verse
[1:10:19] 7 and The Eyes of them both were open
[1:10:23] and they knew that they were naked and
[1:10:25] they sold fig leaves together and made
[1:10:27] themselves
[1:10:39] arons and they heard the voice of the
[1:10:41] Lord Walking In The Garden in the cool
[1:10:43] of the day and Adam and his wife hid
[1:10:46] themselves from the presence of God
[1:10:49] amongst the Trees of the garden
[1:11:06] and this is what sin always
[1:11:09] does sin will always make you
[1:11:13] afraid of the presence of
[1:11:16] God Satan taking you
[1:11:19] further sin will always make you dislike
[1:11:23] coming to church
[1:11:26] you don't like
[1:11:28] Fellowship will always make you not
[1:11:30] wanting to have time of
[1:11:33] prayer sin will always make you not
[1:11:36] having time to read your
[1:11:39] Bible you don't have time to read your
[1:11:41] message books you don't have time you
[1:11:44] know to listen to the
[1:11:46] message or to listen to the
[1:11:49] sermons sin will always make you too
[1:11:52] busy until you don't have time
[1:11:56] like every morning we have a morning
[1:11:59] devotion or morning
[1:12:02] meditation then even in the evening so
[1:12:05] you are too
[1:12:06] busy to put on your phone and listen
[1:12:10] what the pastor is
[1:12:14] exting you are too busy the 10 minutes
[1:12:18] or 15 Mees it seems is a whole day to
[1:12:23] you so it is SE that has drawn you away
[1:12:26] from
[1:12:27] that and that's what happened with
[1:12:30] Adam you know God was walking in the
[1:12:34] garden and then he came to the place of
[1:12:37] fellowship and he couldn't find their
[1:12:40] Adam and then God was concerned about
[1:12:44] Adam it's not that God didn't know what
[1:12:46] Adam was
[1:12:48] in but God keeps his
[1:12:52] appointments praise the name of the Lord
[1:12:54] when they immediately
[1:12:57] se he came at his
[1:13:00] time praise the name of the Lord he came
[1:13:03] in his time and then he said
[1:13:07] Adam where are you you should also be
[1:13:10] the same thing this morning that the
[1:13:12] Lord may be asking
[1:13:14] you where are
[1:13:16] you what is troubling
[1:13:19] you what is binding
[1:13:22] you praise the name of our Lord like you
[1:13:24] know the times of
[1:13:26] Jeremiah and then God was
[1:13:29] asking is it
[1:13:31] because there is no B
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:38] in praise the name of the Lord and then
[1:13:42] you find that the son of
[1:13:44] Ahab you know he had de clim maybe a
[1:13:46] storage
[1:13:49] building and then he fell through you
[1:13:51] know space
[1:13:55] and then he got
[1:13:57] wounds and they were so
[1:14:02] Grievous then he sent one of his
[1:14:06] servants to go to the gods of
[1:14:10] B to ask them can I
[1:14:15] recover then God sends
[1:14:18] Elijah and tells him is it because
[1:14:21] there's no God in
[1:14:23] Israel but you see sin always wants to
[1:14:26] bring wrong suggestions to
[1:14:30] you and then some people when they in
[1:14:34] trouble then the devil tells them maybe
[1:14:37] they bewitching me let me also go to a
[1:14:40] witch
[1:14:42] doctor you know they get
[1:14:45] suggestions things which are
[1:14:47] contrary so now Adam God called
[1:14:51] Adam Adam where are you
[1:14:55] and then the Bible
[1:14:58] says and they heard the voice of the
[1:15:00] Lord God walking in the garden verse
[1:15:06] 8 in the of the day and AD and his wife
[1:15:11] hid themselves from the presence of
[1:15:15] God amongest the
[1:15:18] trees and the Lord called unto
[1:15:22] Adam said Adam
[1:15:26] where are
[1:15:28] you praise the name of the Lord the same
[1:15:31] voice this
[1:15:33] morning where are
[1:15:35] you praise the name of our Lord Brother
[1:15:38] Where are you this morning sister where
[1:15:41] are you this

[1:15:49] thoughts praise the name of the Lord all
[1:15:52] your thoughts already at a place of work
[1:15:53] tomorrow
[1:15:56] all your thoughts are to yesterday's
[1:16:00] disappointments all your thoughts are
[1:16:02] for the travels of
[1:16:04] today I don't know what I'm going to
[1:16:07] eat now would have called for the second
[1:16:12] service I don't know what I'm going to
[1:16:15] do had an
[1:16:18] appointment again there is
[1:16:21] ler when I have my team with is playing
[1:16:27] tonight maybe I'll try to watch using my
[1:16:30] phone and
[1:16:32] check you know where are
[1:16:35] you God was
[1:16:37] asking what has trapped
[1:16:41] you what has caught you in the
[1:16:45] cage praise the name of our Lord and
[1:16:48] then he said I heard thy voice in the
[1:16:51] garden
[1:16:55] and I was
[1:16:57] afraid because I was
[1:17:00] naked and I hid
[1:17:02] myself the condition of
[1:17:05] man when he
[1:17:07] falls he can't save
[1:17:12] himself praise the name of the Lord
[1:17:14] that's the condition of
[1:17:16] man and when man
[1:17:19] fell he couldn't save himself
[1:17:25] in the message
[1:17:27] Jehovah but they wanted something for
[1:17:32] themselves that they could
[1:17:35] do do have their own creats and
[1:17:40] denominations and what more make
[1:17:44] Pharisees sades and
[1:17:47] something they could do
[1:17:52] their man is is trying to save
[1:17:58] his you can't do
[1:18:01] that God has already done
[1:18:03] it you just have to accept
[1:18:07] it and believe
[1:18:10] it the pillar of fire Leed them and
[1:18:13] guide
[1:18:15] them to lead them in a
[1:18:18] way a
[1:18:20] power Grace had provided a power
[1:18:25] to condemn their
[1:18:28] enemy and to make them free the power
[1:18:32] had already been
[1:18:33] given they crossed the Red
[1:18:36] Sea they smart Pharaoh they done all
[1:18:40] those things with
[1:18:42] Grace and then they exchang Grace for a
[1:18:47] long but that had nothing to do with the
[1:18:50] Royal Seed of
[1:18:53] Abraham so brother is telling us that
[1:18:56] the nature of man you feel you need to
[1:18:59] do something about
[1:19:01] yourself when Adam and Eve realized that
[1:19:03] they were
[1:19:05] naked they put fig leaves
[1:19:08] around it was until the presence of God
[1:19:11] came that's when they realized that
[1:19:15] their
[1:19:16] fig was not a good
[1:19:18] covering still they were
[1:19:20] naked even us also it is the same
[1:19:25] praise the name of our Lord let us go to
[1:19:27] the book of
[1:19:29] Isaiah praise the name of our Lord let's
[1:19:32] go to Isaiah chapter
[1:19:38] 65 okay we start from Isaiah
[1:19:44] 64:6 says but we are all as unlean thing
[1:19:49] and all our righteousness are filthy
[1:19:52] rugs and we do all fed as a leaf and our
[1:19:56] iniquities like wind have taken us away
[1:20:31] praise the name of our Lord says our
[1:20:34] righteousness is like filthy
[1:20:43] rugs praise the name of our Lord
[1:20:46] F our
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:20:53] righteous was not a covering
[1:20:57] sufficient when the Lord came he was
[1:21:01] afraid of the presence of
[1:21:03] God until he ran in the in the
[1:21:07] trees and when God said
[1:21:11] Adam where are you then Adam said we are
[1:21:15] here we were afraid of your
[1:21:18] presence we hid
[1:21:20] ourselves because we are naked and sin
[1:21:24] does the same thing even to us is that
[1:21:27] sin takes you
[1:21:29] away sin takes you away from
[1:21:32] fellowship sin takes you away from the
[1:21:34] presence of
[1:21:35] God sin takes you away from the joy of
[1:21:38] the
[1:21:39] Lord sin takes you away from all the
[1:21:43] blessings of
[1:21:45] God but now this morning we want to hear
[1:21:49] that our
[1:21:51] Salvation is of the Lord Praise name of
[1:21:55] regardless of your condition this
[1:21:58] morning regardless of what you have
[1:22:01] done doesn't matter whatever you have
[1:22:04] done it's only God who can deliver you
[1:22:07] out of
[1:22:09] that and then you must have
[1:22:12] faith praise the name of the Lord that
[1:22:14] have come to church this morning I have
[1:22:17] come for my
[1:22:19] salvation I have come for my
[1:22:21] Deliverance I have come to be set free
[1:22:25] from whatever kind of
[1:22:27] bondage from whatever kind of condition
[1:22:30] that is troubling me praise the name of
[1:22:33] our Lord and you shouldn't desire
[1:22:36] today to go back home with the same
[1:22:40] bondage that that's troubling your
[1:22:42] life praise the name of the Lord you
[1:22:44] shouldn't desire today to go back with
[1:22:48] the same bad
[1:22:50] mind that you have been having but you
[1:22:54] need to stand before the
[1:22:55] Lord here I am praise the name of the
[1:22:59] Lord like Adam when he heard the voice
[1:23:02] of he said Lord I'm here but I'm
[1:23:07] naked praise the name of our Lord you
[1:23:09] also need to do the same
[1:23:11] confession Lord come to church but have
[1:23:14] this
[1:23:15] bondage Lord have come to church but
[1:23:18] have these things traveling me not come
[1:23:21] to church but have these trou
[1:23:25] praise the name of the Lord now when
[1:23:27] Adam after his realization the Bible
[1:23:31] says that
[1:23:33] God dressed
[1:23:35] them with animal
[1:23:38] skin he sacrificed an
[1:23:41] animal the blood was shed to Aton for
[1:23:45] their sins and then he covered their
[1:23:49] nakedness the same thing now Adam would
[1:23:53] not serve himself
[1:23:55] Adam would not deliver himself so we are
[1:23:59] also here this morning that is only God
[1:24:03] who can handle my Str it's only God who
[1:24:07] can deliver me from whatever condition
[1:24:09] I'm in and God knows what condition you
[1:24:13] are
[1:24:13] in praise the name of our Lord you only
[1:24:16] need to say Lord Here I Am Lord Set Me
[1:24:19] Free Lord deliver me from whatever is
[1:24:22] traveling Me Lord deliver me in whatever
[1:24:26] bondage I'm
[1:24:27] In Praise the name of our so we see in
[1:24:31] Jonah chapter 2 that Jonah was caught up
[1:24:34] in a
[1:24:35] sttion he was in the bury of the sheep
[1:24:39] of the
[1:24:41] fish for three days and three
[1:24:44] nights nobody will deliver
[1:24:47] Jon praise the name of our Lord nobody
[1:24:50] knew where Jonah was even as today may
[1:24:54] not know where you are you may be in
[1:24:57] church but you are more
[1:25:00] troubled praise the name of you have a
[1:25:03] lot of negative
[1:25:06] thoughts until you are not comfortable
[1:25:08] with
[1:25:10] everybody at home nobody knows where you
[1:25:13] are you are so troubled you are in such
[1:25:17] a great
[1:25:18] bondage Jonah was also in such a great
[1:25:22] bondage nobody would save Jonah
[1:25:24] but the Bible says Jonah Cried unto the
[1:25:28] Lord out of instraction you can also do
[1:25:32] the same thing out of in whatever
[1:25:35] condition you in and then say Lord Here
[1:25:37] I Am Lord deliver me out of
[1:25:40] this Lord deliver me out of
[1:25:43] distra your neighbors may not understand
[1:25:47] your friends may not understand your
[1:25:49] wife may not understand your husband may
[1:25:52] not understand your children not
[1:25:54] understand your parents may not be
[1:25:57] understanding but in whatever condition
[1:25:59] you are in like Jonah in the
[1:26:02] fish he cry to the Lord praise the name
[1:26:06] of our Lord and then the Bible says the
[1:26:09] Lord had
[1:26:12] Jonah and he still here today praise the
[1:26:16] name of our Lord he can hear you praise
[1:26:19] the name of our Lord say Lord this is my
[1:26:22] condition praise the name of our
[1:26:25] salvation is of the
[1:26:27] Lord praise the name of our Lord so now
[1:26:30] Jonah realized he couldn't help
[1:26:34] himself and that's also we need to
[1:26:37] realize that in the condition I'm going
[1:26:39] through in the circumstance I'm in I

[1:26:53] recognize weaknesses you need to
[1:26:56] recognize your failures and then you

[1:27:01] the Bible tells us in Romans chapter
[1:27:05] 10 praise the name of our Lord Romans
[1:27:09] chapter
[1:27:10] 10 and then verse
[1:27:13] 13 the Bible says whosoever shall call
[1:27:17] upon the name of the
[1:27:21] Lord shall be saved

[1:28:14] set free how hard is
[1:28:17] that praise the name of the Lord you

[1:28:22] need to take some time
[1:28:25] and I need to go to the other Prayer
[1:28:28] Mountain and he looks at his work
[1:28:31] schedule there is no
[1:28:33] leave then he says now let me plan to
[1:28:36] get leave next
[1:28:37] month and wait on the
[1:28:41] Lord even now when you call upon him he
[1:28:46] hears you praise the name of if you're a
[1:28:49] student oh when are we getting

[1:29:03] hears praise the name of the Lord look
[1:29:05] atation of
[1:29:07] Jonah three days and three
[1:29:11] nights in the fish and then he said the
[1:29:14] RS were around my
[1:29:16] head I was at the bottom of the
[1:29:21] mountain then he said
[1:29:24] I remembered the
[1:29:26] Lord praise the name of the Lord you

[1:29:45] name of the Lord and when you call upon
[1:29:48] the name of the Lord the Bible says you
[1:29:51] shall be saved you shall be delivered
[1:29:55] you shall be set

[1:35:08] your
[1:35:09] deliver praise the name of the Lord like
[1:35:12] in the Year of
[1:35:13] Jubilee when the trumpet
[1:35:16] sounded somebody was a
[1:35:18] slave to do
[1:35:22] well was to leave that
[1:35:25] bondage obey the
[1:35:28] trumpets praise the name of our Lord
[1:35:30] when the trumpet sounds you are free you
[1:35:33] are free you run away from that
[1:35:36] condition praise the name of but now if

[1:35:52] house they but you're
[1:35:55] slave you're slave now they telling
[1:36:00] you the time you have been spending with
[1:36:02] that task
[1:36:04] master working for him and it doesn't
[1:36:08] pay you you only gives you food the
[1:36:12] house health
[1:36:18] insurance if you fall sick will take you
[1:36:20] for
[1:36:21] treatment give
[1:36:26] your
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:32] own you see there are some people who
[1:36:34] are bound in
[1:36:36] sttion until at some places of
[1:36:39] work some people don't want
[1:36:43] promotions because there are some
[1:36:45] benefits there
[1:36:54] when they are transferring them they
[1:36:57] have
[1:36:57] excuses you know I come from this
[1:37:01] region
[1:37:04] this but if they saying this is a
[1:37:07] time to be free why are still lock
[1:37:12] there praise the name of the Lord what
[1:37:15] benefits is
[1:37:16] there to live with the
[1:37:20] T like the children of Israel
[1:37:24] they were with the Egyptian
[1:37:27] torment but now they were saying where
[1:37:29] will be the
[1:37:32] grave praise the name of Lord you know
[1:37:35] like some people in the
[1:37:37] denominations when you tell them
[1:37:44] get they just thinking about a a church
[1:37:50] building where they're going to bring
[1:37:52] their cops
[1:37:56] and that's all why they staying
[1:38:00] there the trumpet is
[1:38:03] sounding you are
[1:38:11] free what is
[1:38:13] important is not how you're going to be
[1:38:16] bued what is important how you're going
[1:38:19] to come out of
[1:38:20] that praise the name of the Lord but
[1:38:23] looking at how to go
[1:38:25] inside but not how they going to come
[1:38:29] out whether you are buried with such
[1:38:32] great
[1:38:33] Hors like the Rich Young
[1:38:35] Ruler the Bible says he was
[1:38:38] bued you know here
[1:38:41] in we had an M there elderly man so when
[1:38:46] he was made an
[1:38:48] M when he was contesting for the second
[1:38:51] time
[1:38:55] you people V me you put me
[1:38:58] back let me
[1:39:01] be for him that was all he was looking
[1:39:04] forward the second
[1:39:07] time so he was not even believing of
[1:39:10] finishing the second
[1:39:13] time how you can imagine
[1:39:16] such so there are people who are bound
[1:39:18] in bondages
[1:39:21] [Music]
[1:39:23] this is where I
[1:39:25] benefit again if I
[1:39:27] get I will not be able to do this and
[1:39:30] this and
[1:39:32] this praise the name of our Lord but God
[1:39:35] is telling
[1:39:36] us this is the year of
[1:39:39] jubile this is the time to be delivered
[1:39:42] this is the time to be set free you
[1:39:45] accept
[1:39:46] it praise the name of the Lord was
[1:39:49] telling if you do well
[1:39:53] you'll be
[1:39:54] accepted but Kan refused to do
[1:39:57] well and so sin took over him so what
[1:40:01] did he do he goes and Dees his
[1:40:07] brother and then he escs him and then
[1:40:10] slays him now after killing
[1:40:14] AB God comes and asks
[1:40:17] Kan where is your
[1:40:19] brother am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:40:24] that kind of
[1:40:26] attitude then God pronounced judgment
[1:40:29] upon
[1:40:32] Kain now when Kan saw the Judgment was
[1:40:35] too heavy for
[1:40:37] him he
[1:40:40] prayed let us go further to that
[1:40:45] scripture verse
[1:40:48] 13 Cain said unto the Lord my punishment
[1:40:52] is great than I can
[1:40:59] bear he
[1:41:01] prayed he has killed his brother he
[1:41:04] doesn't want to die said but Lord all
[1:41:07] this
[1:41:08] curses it's too much for me too much for
[1:41:12] me then he says verse 15 and the Lord
[1:41:18] said unto
[1:41:19] him therefore whoever slay
[1:41:24] VG shall be taken on him
[1:41:30] Sevenfold you
[1:41:32] see is too much people will kill me then
[1:41:37] God says the one who kills you I punish
[1:41:40] them seven
[1:41:41] times now you can imagine a fallen man
[1:41:46] like a serpent seed
[1:41:49] like praying to God and God here
[1:41:54] how about
[1:41:56] you praise the name of Lord how about
[1:41:59] you in whatever
[1:42:07] condition don't
[1:42:09] understand whosoever shall call upon the
[1:42:12] name of the
[1:42:13] Lord praise the name of our Lord take
[1:42:16] that
[1:42:17] promise as yours that when I call upon
[1:42:21] the name of the Lord
[1:42:23] He Shall Set Me Free praise the name of
[1:42:26] our Lord we can look at another
[1:42:29] example we go to the book of First
[1:42:33] Kings praise the name of our
[1:42:36] Lord First Kings chapter
[1:42:46] 2 and then we go to verse 18
[1:42:55] God was telling
[1:42:57] Elijah go arise and meet Ahab king of
[1:43:00] Israel which is in Samaria behold he is
[1:43:03] in the vineard of nabo with he gone down
[1:43:07] to possess it
[1:43:24] and thou shal speak unto him saying thus
[1:43:27] says the Lord hast thou killed and th
[1:43:31] taken possession and thou shallal speak
[1:43:33] unto him saying thus says the Lord in
[1:43:36] the place where dogs leaked the blood of
[1:43:39] nabo shall the dogs lick thy blood even
[1:43:42] thine
[1:44:05] andab said unto
[1:44:08] Elijah thou Hast Found Me Oh My Enemy
[1:44:11] and he answered I have found thee
[1:44:14] because thou Hast so thyself to work
[1:44:16] evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:44:33] behold I'll bring evil upon thee and
[1:44:36] will take away thy posterity and will
[1:44:40] cut off from Ahab him that PES against
[1:44:42] the wall and him that is shut up and
[1:44:45] left in Israel
[1:45:06] and I'll make thine house like the house
[1:45:07] of jeroboam the son of nebat and like
[1:45:10] the house of Basha the son of aijah for
[1:45:13] the provocation where withth thou has
[1:45:14] provoked me to anger and made Israel to
[1:45:17] s
[1:45:34] and of Jezebel also shall also spoke the
[1:45:38] Lord saying the dogs shall eat Jezebel
[1:45:41] by the wall of
[1:45:51] jezrael him that dieth Ahab in the city
[1:45:54] the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in
[1:45:57] the field shall the Falls of the air
[1:46:17] eat but there was none like Ahab which
[1:46:22] did sell himself to work wickedness in
[1:46:25] the sight of the Lord whom Jezebel his
[1:46:28] wife steered up
[1:46:38] yet and he did very abdominally in
[1:46:42] following Idols according to all the
[1:46:44] things as did the amorites whom the Lord
[1:46:47] cast out before the children of Israel
[1:47:10] now you can
[1:47:13] imagine the
[1:47:16] wickedness what he has
[1:47:19] done when Elijah proclaimed judgment on
[1:47:22] Earth
[1:47:25] what did do the man said
[1:47:28] Lord have upon
[1:47:31] me in verse
[1:47:33] 27 and it came to pass when Ahab heard
[1:47:37] those
[1:47:39] words that he rent his
[1:47:42] clothes and put sack cloth upon his
[1:47:47] flesh and
[1:47:49] fasted and laid low in the SA
[1:47:56] close and went
[1:47:59] Sly and the word of the Lord came to
[1:48:04] Elijah theer
[1:48:07] saying see how Ahab humbles himself
[1:48:10] before
[1:48:13] me because he humbles himself before
[1:48:17] me I will not bring this evil in his
[1:48:21] days
[1:48:24] but in the sun days will I bring the
[1:48:26] evil upon his
[1:48:30] house if God would
[1:48:34] hear God would
[1:48:37] hear and the Bible say when the te
[1:48:43] Pray when the teers pray for the
[1:48:50] rain what happens trains on
[1:48:54] them how about
