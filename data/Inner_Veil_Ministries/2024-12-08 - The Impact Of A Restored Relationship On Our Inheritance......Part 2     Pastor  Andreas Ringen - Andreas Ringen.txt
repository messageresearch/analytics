where shall s the king Place amen amen so you are welcome not around I will not say the next so um the ministers come up here just to recognize your presence I know you are very responsible people but you put down these meetings I mean your meetings to come and be with us here and uh we certain to recognize you so much and we pray that the Lord may continue to bless you in your undertakings as you work to build the kingdom of God Amen so we are just short of time you know one time when brother Bram went to the Pentecostal people for the first time there was an Minister that was preaching and he preached out into eternity back here on so he screamed and said you don't have enough space for me to preach and we want to say we don't have enough time for brother Andreas to preach so we shall not go into the merits of introducing everybody but together let us just say God bless you amen these are the Servants of God they every week on the field they are doing the work of God so keep praying for them amen because it's very necessary I normally use my statement keep the prayers coming amen we like that so God bless you thank you for being present amen amen uh we don't have oh brother Steven St yeah God bless you amen we appreciate you being here amen amen we thank God and uh we shall just ask my brother to come right away and speak to the people what God has put upon his heart God bless you all do you love him let's help our brother preach okay amen amen yes the Lord is good praise the lord we serve a wonderful [Music] God that is actually my uh my uh introduction many times this is my introduction many times uh that what brother Steven just spoke of uh the time is always not my friend so amen so uh but I'm I'm we're looking forward for the time when we don't have to go home when we sit together spend eternity together I don't think I will preach there I I think we will have Fellowship together amen so but that Fellowship was brothers and sisters that Fellowship there's there's no big no small an important man unimportant because in in Christ we are all the same there's neither here on Earth we still have the difference as long as we are in these bodies we will have even the difference between man and woman when you come on the to the other side it's just brothers and sisters and as the Bible say in Christ there's neither neither male nor female in Christ We Are All One amen what a great time we are going to a time where time where time doesn't matter amen a time where time is not so important amen a time when we don't have to look at the time what what we are facing amen and we believe the Lord has blessed us so much amen and we want to give all the preeminence to the word in the beginning was the word in the word was with God and the Word was God and finally that word became flesh and dwelt Among Us amen that word we are speaking of Amen not the Bible not the book but in the beginning and in the beginning was the words and if you are Eternal as brother R would say if you are Eternal you was with him in the beginning amen eternal life eternal life this is who you really were you know brother made a statement he said he said there was a time when we knew that but our mind is darkened to that now we we come here with amnesia you know Amnesia brother venam said comes by different things comes by different things it comes by a shock and your birth was a shock to you so you came here to Earth with total Amnesia amen amen you didn't know that's why you need to be born again something needs to wake up the real you needs to wake up [Music] amen but brother random said there was a time when you knew who you were amen hallelujah where are we coming from what what destination do we have amen hallelujah and when when you know where you come from then you know where you are going Hallelujah maybe we are not there yet we are still in the body of Flesh when we know where we are come from then we know where we are going we come from the mind of God and we come come back expressed we don't go back into the mind of God but we go back to be expressed my own son that was in my loins will never go back into my loins but he will be he will be with me he's constantly there this we will be in eternity we don't go back to the mind of God we go back to be expressed with him what a future we have this world is falling apart this world is falling apart but Jesus was praying for another world Hallelujah Jesus was praying for another world he said he said to in John he said my little children the Bible would say say the Bible would say so does God love the world that he gave his only begotten son what world does God love hallelujah what world does God love amen when John tells us little children if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not in you so what world is it that God loves you are the world that God L amen for you he gave his only begotten and what kind of a world we go back to a world of brothers and sisters world a world of the True Believers what a great time that we are facing God bless you amen amen it's wonderful to when you start start and the pool is there I'm very attentive to the pool sometimes ruins the service but I'm not sometimes I'm sometimes I want Wonder but I say Lord what can I do if you just feel the spirit pulling in that direction what what shall we do amen we just believe that is a deep calling to the de and there's if there's a deep calling there's a deep respond believe that there's there's a deep calling now a call from deep inside a call from the from the real you when the deep is calling to the Deep Hallelujah then the Deep will respond and I believe that God is really moving in a mighty way God bless you let us stand this evening and uh we just want to go quick back read only one scripture Genesis we want to uh we want to look if we can continue a little bit we want to speak on the impact of restored relationship on our inheritance amen the Promised Land Genesis 5 and he just said to you this morning just keep that this will be our finally closing scripture this evening as the Lord permits amen Genesis 5:24 very wonderful scripture and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him amen let us pray together Heavenly Father what a great story and we know what Enoch is a type of Enoch lived his life and maybe he didn't know that we would speak about him today but you put him there he just went there he lived his life as an example for us to come so that we can come at the final stage the sevens from the second [Music] Adam we know how the Rapture will take place father we pray just take us behind the holy behind the veil take us into the holies of holies and may the curtains fall behind us and father let me May each and everyone have Fellowship relationship with you we ask for your honor and For Your Glory in Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you may be seated um as I maybe want to start with a with a again with a statement of brother Brenham what he does in the Rapture brother Ram in the Rapture message he made like in any other messages also makes a very very profound statement now the rapture is only he said is the rapture that we are talking about is only for the bride amen the re is only for the bride hallelujah hallelujah so the church can do what they want they can be as nice as they try try you cannot earn to be in the Rapture you cannot work yourself in the Rapture remember as we said this as we said this morning they came people to him and they told him have we not done this in your name we have done everything in your name we have preached in your name we have cast out even de devils in your name and Jesus would look to him them and he said I don't even know you so the Rapture is only for the bride I want to say that again it's nice and remember as we speak of foolish and wise virgin amen the the foolish virgins they were virgins but the others were wise and they were foolish but they were virgins that means that means they had kept themselves clean you understand that they have they have done also a lot in their life they refused the wrong and it is wonderful if you refuse wrong but if you just refuse wrong you never make a mistake in your life does is not the qualification to go in the [Music] Rapture hallelujah amen amen that's not the qualification [Music] to we should do our best because we love him there will be good people in hell and there will be bad people in heaven remember the Rich Young Ruler he was a very very good boy respectful I have done everything from my you Jesus loved him because he was a nice boy but he opened his eyes in Hell amen the prophet showed us that it was this Rich Young Ruler that opened his eyes in hell and we read the the we read the the wonderful example of Matthew 22 when when a king was making wedding for his son again like this morning it was not the son making wedding for himself it was the father making wedding for his son amen again you see the principle again through all the Bible always the father because it is unveiling of God God wants to unveil himself God needs a church God needs a bride where the head is Jesus Christ like the head was Adam amen but Adam needed the woman God said it is not good that man is why because if man is alone can Express himself man is alone he cannot manif he cannot multiply if man is alone if the woman is in the man he cannot multiply all that God was he pour into Christ God needed Christ to express who he is and dwell as the fullness of the godhead B that's why God said this is my beloved Son in him I can express myself completely Hallelujah and I believe that's for that's why God needs the bride today and so it's always the father and as we saw that as we said there's good there's there was there will be good good people in hell like the Rich Young Ruler there will be bad people in heaven they don't stay bad amen but God can take bad people God can take bad people come on Church Matthew 22 read it not now take it home and here the father you know it's it's again amazing it was the king the father [Music] inviting this should make us Marvel why is the father inviting it was not the son inviting people it was not the son inviting guests it was the father is that right and people refused to come to the wedding is it right allow me to say that might maybe shock you people refuse people refused to be the bride Matthew 22 there's the king the father where's the bride where's the bridegroom it was the father inviting remember it was always the father was making Adam a wife the father was making Christ a bride he put Christ into a deep sleep at Calvary and then he caused the bride to take him he ca a deep sleep on Adam then the father took something and made the bride out of it he was the father he was the king inviting come to the wedding come to the wedding of my son all of them refused and he get so upset the father gets so upset I mean he should be happy less people are coming less expenses W but the father is abset come on Church why is the father this is a type church this is a type that people are invited to come to the wedding for the marriage supper of the land finally the father said go everywhere take good and evil so there will be evil people at the wedding that's why I said there will be evil people in heaven but what happens at the wedding Watch What Happens at the wedding if you follow the invitation if you are willing to be a part of the marriage of the L that character God needs then when you come to the wedding at the door because we all have to enter through that door and that door is Christ there you see the husband standing the husband standing at the door what he has in store the wedding garment he has [Applause] inore so good and evil as they come to that process through the door they get a wedding garments you follow hallelujah oh if he could walk that principle why is the father so anxious why is the king upset when people said I'm sorry I have no time to come to church I have something to do it my my cows and my animals and my my crop my field I'm sorry hey come on how many times we have excuses to come to church how many times we have excuses to come up to church this is more important and that is more important God wants to have you here because you are God's potential why was the king so upset of them refusing to come to did you ever thought of it like I said he should be happy because less people less eating but you understand the principle everyone that refused to come taken the chance away from the King to express himself Abraham he was very careful what kind of bride Isaac would have Abraham was more cared than Isaac himself is it not amazing it was not Isaac saying if you go you find me a bride don't go to wrong places just go to my family no it was Abraham Abraham Abraham listen very carefully Abraham but Rebecca should not be Abraham's bride Rebecca should be Isaac's bride but you know what Abraham knew Isaac is me in another form and when Isaac has a bride the right kind of bright the next one will be in further expression am this is what Abraham knew this is what God knows that's why God is careful God is looking for a bride for Christ it is always the father it is always the father because this is the unveiling of [Music] God I trust you can take that sorry I trust you can take that not the unveiling of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the head of the body but this is the unveiling of God hallelujah can you say praise the Lord oh I trust you understand amen as we go slowly so the the Rapture is only for the bride she it's only for the bride so you cannot work yourself into it canot pray prayers to be a part of it you you cannot pay money to be a part of it whatever you can do the Rapture is only for the bride are you not glad that by grace he chose you that's why the scripture said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you he understands election it's God's love to you that he chose that he chose you not not to be a man or a woman in Uganda to be a part of the Bride if you are a part of the Bride cannot miss the Rapture the Rapture the Rapture will come to you the dead in Christ will come to you they will only come to Bright material Hallelujah can be say thank you Lord yes can we say thank you Lord hallelujah so regardless how clever you are in school how good you are with your hands that doesn't qualify you to be the hallelujah hallelujah amen am you you are you are you you are God chose you to be a part of the Bride so as brother R would say brother Ram said um remember also the prophet would speak about little children you know when little children when they die people ask brother Rand the question when little babies little children die they had no chance to decide they had no chance they never came to the age of decision so when they die they're born in sin is that right but the blood of Jesus Christ come on Church they said brother R where does little babies and children go he said babies when they die he say they go to heaven amen amen and then they asked him another question what about the Rapture brother Adam said if they are predestinated for that again hallelujah amen you understand it's not your choice it's not what you can do or what you have not done it's only by Grace just God's Grace Church never forget that the Rapture it's God's grace to you if we if we receive it like that God can show us very very far Hallelujah never get puffed up never think you have earned you the Rapture I have preached all of my life there's people that preach much more than myself there's people in the world they pray much more than you pray brother bam said the church with the Zeal they have will push the bride aside that's why they come to him and say have not we done it in your name we were hard workers in your name we have cast out Devils we have laid hands on the SI in your name and Jesus just looked at them he said I don't know you Hallelujah come on church it's God's grace because it's God's grace you should love him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen my have we started yes okay we have started because we understand when we speak of bright listen brother Bram never said all that are saved go in the Rapture he said only the bride will go in the amen amen hallelujah amen there's many people saved they know Jesus Christ as their savior do you know Jesus Christ as your savior can I see your hands okay hallelujah what a wonderful relationship that [Music] is but when he saved you for what he saved you uhuh when I save some money it is for a purpose when I have 100o when I have 100o and I know a bill is coming from 50 then I will save from the hundred 50 and don't give it way because I save it because I have a purpose Hallelujah am hallelujah amen am amen am so that's why when you are saved you should not stop walking you said walking walking walking when you are saved you should ask the Lord what is the reason you saved me hallelujah hallelujah but only the bride will go in the rapture hallelujah amen and as we speak of the Bride it speaks of a certain relationship it is the bride of Christ it was the Bride of Isaac but Abraham choose her Hallelujah it is the bride of Christ but God chose you yeah you follow the principle because Abraham knew Isaac is me in another form and when he has a good bride the potential is there that another expression of myself comes through Isaac God knows if the Bride is a good bride he can express himself through Jesus Christ Hallelujah am Hallelujah yes what a story that is can we see that in the amen It's a Wonderful we show it from genes from Genesis you can see from the Garden of Eden that's why brother Ram said the oldest institution the oldest institution gave to his children is what marriage before there any church was even before the fall and I want to say marriage was not introduced because of the Fall marriage was introduced before the fall hallelujah amen hallelujah who was the performer oh my if we understand what God is doing we understand that God has to inherit something and and for inheriting something he needs somebody that takes that inheritance you understand that there's things that God cannot do Hallelujah amen amen the level the level the level and kind of relationship you have to the one who inherits defines what your inheritance will be amen I want to give you a very simple example so powerful I'm married I have a wife I have one wife I have 10 children if my time has come if my time has come and the Lord calls me home then I have certain things to inherit maybe I have a house or whatever who herit who inherits the who inherits the most they are say the wife yes my [Applause] wife my children also but first is my wife [Applause] amen you find that principle in the Bible [Music] oh hallelujah oh my oh my oh you are saying something different yes cannot inherit we find that in the Bible we find that in the Bible go back to the Book of Esther go back to the book of es now we don't go take the ex if you take the example of Esther when she came to the king because of her position I don't know if children were there [Music] already maybe maybe she had children the king had many wives there was a lot of children lot of children maybe Esther and the King they had children but the King was not so much interested in the children the King was interested in his wife that's why when Esther came what what the king said half of my kingdom I give you hallelujah amen amen amen so it is very interesting because if we come to relationship and I want you to be very careful Adam and his wife was not created as little [Music] children amen is it right they were grown up yes ah I trust we can get that the position of the [Music] Bride when God Saves you you become and you are his son and his daughter but when he places you then you become the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah am amen amen so as you allow me to say that you can see that even with the with the Patriarchs you can see that in many types in the Bible that the woman even when it came to Adam and his wife Adam had a strong bound to the woman then he had to his own son because the wife came out of him do you know what brother Bram said when you marry the right kind of person here on Earth you have you have a partner for eternity amen but we will not have sexual desire in eternity it's just a higher order can we say praise the Lord I just want to show you the position that the bride has when it comes to inheritance hallelujah amen amen you know why why my wife stays closer to me than my children I never unveil myself to my children is that correct come on church I only unveil myself to my wife she knows me so much better than all of my children yeah come on come on come on I trust I can say that the Bride of Jesus Christ knows God better than all the children of God God has many children but a small [Applause] Bri is it right every every one knows that with whom does a husband share the deepest Secrets not with his children with his wife come on church I'm a father I know have children but to my children I cannot speak the way brother Ram actually said my children have no claims on me as husband only my wife has hallelujah amen and watch what brother V is say he said today Christ is Whispering the secrets to [Applause] whom come on church to whom God is unveiling himself that's why God has many children God has many children in denomination God has only one bride [Applause] hallelujah amen I tell you this message is something special do you believe he's here today what is he doing today sorry what is he doing today whispering to you it's not the minister telling you as a minister is preaching the holy spirit is telling you speaking personally to you revealing himself personally you know why because you are the Bride of Jesus Christ am Hallelujah am it's not just only to get us emotional this is what we have at home honestly at home I know maybe in Africa you have the custom of many wives not all but but some have but in the beginning it was not so God has only one [Music] wife come on church I have only one wife but I have many children come on church God has only one wife but God has many children and God today he's sharing his Secrets he's sharing his Insight not just because all the children is [Applause] his amen hallelujah yes sir amen that's why we need the prophet to come that's why the marriage of the Lamb has to come because The Marriage of the Lamb brings us back the first marriage happened in Eden the fall came by eating now in Satan's Eden restoration comes back to you while you eat and the marriage of the Lamb takes place the marriage of the Lamb Tak that brings us back to our original relationship Hallelujah that brings us back to where we belong [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah my don't forget Adam and Eve Adam and the woman was made in the image of God amen amen they were made and help help me they were created but also made as we can say it's it's it's beautiful because also Satan is created Satan is created but like we said this morning he is Created from nothing but when God made Adam and his wife he made them from something that's why the true bride goes not back to nothing the bright the true bright let's go quickly first John let's go together first John 3:9 it makes it it makes it very plain chose it very beautiful uh as we can say Satan was created is that right who created him God Adam and Eve was made they were also created in the image of God created but watch the difference 1 John 3:9 whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for the seed remains in then he cannot sin because he is born of [Music] God allow me to make that [Music] simple you are born of God Satan is born from God because God has created him but he that is born of God he cannot commit sin we see the difference every remember as the woman would say I have received a man from the Lord speaking of Cain oh yeah yeah yeah yeah how many people got confused because they say why should became serpent but watch what she said I have received from the Lord and it was Cain brother Ram said every life comes from God but not every life is of god you get that he never said I got the man of the Lord he said I got the man from the Lord and that was Kain you are there and he that is born of God cannot sin because the seed remains in it are you not glad that you are born of God let me let me expound a little on that because I we want to really make that relationship so hallelujah hallelujah oh my if I had time what kind of relationship it was between Adam and God what relationship they had he was made in the image of God is that right so as you would see them walking in Eden you wouldn't see a great Pillar of Fire you wouldn't see a great Pillar of Fire and a small pillar of as father on what would you see he was in the image of God if you see an image of me you don't see a little baby if you're an image of me you see me in another form hallelujah amen that relationship existed and because of that relationship there was an inheritance it was there was an inheritance and God said multiplied [Music] God never said I will multiply he said to Adam and his wife multiply replenish the Earth Hallelujah one an inheritance with other words with other words you make more of the kind that I started can we get that hallelujah what an inheritance what an air of God come on Church Jesus did not only die yes he did he did not only die sorry that your sins are forgiven he died so you can come back to your full inheritance yes if you speak to the mountain brother random asked the question is said all in the atonement he said sure hey sure God would tell him that's why Jesus died when God said Jesus said it's finished salvation was complete the same carabines the same car the same angels that guarded the way to the Tree of Life Hallelujah now pushing elect back to the tree of life which is now CA the restoration of the brid [Applause] tree Hallelujah can we see in the [Music] beginning that tree in the garden was a person is it okay when I say that okay male and female together mean because male and female create did he them were they not made in the image of God the Bible tells us male and female created he them it was one tree my church let us wake up that's why brother Adam could say this is the restoration of the Bride tree not a different tree not another tree the same tree tree of life hallelujah hallelujah oh I tell you marriage I I I I hope I can say say that understanding in the light of the examples of the Bible marriage is more powerful than birth I trust I can say that father God has many children but only one bride and many and many membered body don't mix that Hallelujah somebody can say Amen if they shakes a little bit your culture Let It Be Shaken our culture we have a different culture I'm not bound by the German culture you should not be bound and limited by the African culture we have a Heavenly culture we should not bound by national Spirits we have the German national Spirits we have the African National Spirits the national Spirit of the Bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ is the Holy Spirit is that okay Hallelujah see if I my my my my my God help us God help us what the church what the Bible tells us with examples how powerful marriage is how powerful marriage is not because of birth not because of birth Ruth was born nothing to inherit come on church by marriage by marriage not by birth by marriage not by birth by marriage but I want to let you know this marriage is a true birth this marriage is a true baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah he Lord help us to paint a complete picture Ruth by marriage by marriage is it right because of marriage you find her in Matthew 1 in the lineage of Jesus Christ Hallelujah because of marriage let us say praise the Lord if you if you cannot say [Music] Amen say praise the Lord hallelujah if you say long enough praise the Lord you finally will say Amen this is not what the minister thinks the first Covenant before children were born God gave the marriage covenant hallelujah amen amen hallelujah oh my if God is showing that come on church and I want to say something the woman was not the child the woman was the Bride of oh my oh my oh my I trust we understand this message church is different than everything else this planet that's why God have to send the prophet behold I will send you and then he shall come the mystery of God shall be finished shall be completed Ruth had no rights she had no legal rights even the Israelites they should avoid Moab is that right so she had no Ruth has no chance by natural birth to come into the lineage but then somebody came somebody came and lifted her up oh yes yes yes come on Church lifted gave her a new name I don't call you Church any longer I call you bride now lifting you up Hallelujah when God comes down God gets only dark can only Unite with dark human being can only Unite with human being God can only unite his [Applause] hallelujah what did he do by the blood of the Lamb takes you not only forgives you you only forgives you you and here you stands virtuous you have never done it you have never done it hallelujah hallelujah is that right darks marry darks you never saw horses marrying men doesn't work amen hallelujah hallelujah come on Church hallelujah oh my like if if we had the time you see how many details start opening the holy spirit is here now to bring all the lose ends together Hallelujah and then somebody came and married her that marriage lifted her up Suddenly she was not Ruth the moabit suddenly she was Ruth the wife of Hallelujah what about what about RAB a what about RAB the Harlot a harlot it's good to think about she had come on Church what you say and she was good to the T boys good to the day boys [Music] Church she applied the token I trust I can say that that was not enough I was that mother it needed a man to come and marry her you see all the types in the Bible I trust it is not confusing to you but is it not the truth she was the Harlot she obeyed the Prophet The Messengers she even applied the token but that did not brought her into the lineage of Jesus Christ now this is go Church justification made a way for [Music] sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes a way for the entire Holy Ghost now come back to the church to be United isn't that wonderful and so mysterious and here she is still Raab the H Hallelujah and I can understand as she was there in the whole city the walls of Jericho they fall down and I can imagine many people died there in that and then the time came then the time came when she should be lifted up from RAB the har who is Forgiven to RAB the wife of Salomon come on church and as the wedding ceremony went on you know that Jericho was lot of and Solomon fell in love with Rahab Solon was a general in Israel yes he saw the potentials of that woman he saw the potential in that girl she's obeying every word yes she received the Holy Ghost oh yes oh yes yes isn't that beautiful I'm sorry I enjoy not what I preach but I enjoy what is in the word I enjoy what is in the Bible read your Bible it becomes a new book things come out of your Bible that you have never seen before and as they were in the wedding ceremony maybe Joshua performed it he said and he's asking the public here we have we have we have we have ought RAB the har and here we have Salon salmon do you want to take this wife you a Godly weeded wife and Salon said yes before Joshua had to ask is there somebody here in the audience that has legal rights on that woman remember she was a harlot there was many men in Jer Hallelujah but when when Joshua asked the question he stood bold because all of them had died come on church God told Israel what did God told Israel clean the place come on Church hello [Music] hello so as they were standing there and maybe Rahab was a little nervous Hallelujah because she knew her past Solomon said to her don't worry Salon said we killed them all your bridegroom Jesus Christ today tell you don't worry about your old husband they are all dead hey hallelujah hallelujah listen is that okay when I say that what lifted her up from a har to a mother in the lineage of Jesus Christ hallelujah what lifted her up is it okay when I say that it was not the obedience to the tap boys many people trust oh we are good to the Bram family we should be good to the BR we should pray for the BR [Music] but that didn't lifted her up she stayed right the Harlot is that okay when I say that even with the Scarlet Strat outside hanging even with a Scarlet threat that was just the down payment that's why the baptism of the Holy Ghost Paul said is a down payment can we say praise the Lord what did Paul say to the Ephesians Paul Paul what he tells you the Ephesians I have heard of your faith I have heard of your faith I have heard of your love I have heard that you have all reive the Holy Spirit and Paul said now I pray come on church that God gives you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation that's why Paul could say the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a down payment but the full price is when he comes [Applause] [Music] down how powerful that isina I asked you a question was Martin Luther Martin Lu was he born again come on was he born again has had Martin Luther the Holy Ghost yes yes amen am he was born again he had the Holy Ghost and the people around him the same and yet there was no Rapture Pentecost was the restoration of the gifts the sign of the baptism of the Holy Ghost justification under Luther sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost under the Pentecost but it never produced a Rapture because the Rapture is only for the [Applause] bride but what came to us in this hour is able to bring forth a rapture now here reab the remember her past how many husbands she had had how many lovers she had had they were all dead but the devil were always reminding her maybe they were family of them around and they all reminded her hey pH they phon her every day he sayab rabab are you know what her husband her husband told right next time when they phone you tell them your new name [Music] next next time she picked up the phone and there isab the said no we want to speak toab the she's not here any [Applause] I'm a new creation I a brand new man the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed me total I'm so much forgiven that I have not done it come on come on come on come on come on red red if you s we read a scarlet and here you have the red blood of Jesus Christ red Church red true red is a white wedding white wedding [Music] [Applause] garment you ever thought of white the Bible would say white as snow but now you Africans who has seen snow of you not too many I guess said right maybe you have seen snow on a picture but when I can tell you you will be white as the wedding garment is white amen hallelujah am hallelujah amen can you say praise the Lord praise the Lord that's the power of [Music] marriage goodness my goodness we could go we could go into another type in the Bible you read Genesis 38 you read it at home is a story of we don't go in that now Hallelujah but because he was chosen into marriage it had an inheritance Hallelujah and that inheritance was so big at the end Judah Judah the word in action said to Tamar you are more righteous than me this is your Bible right all the examples in the Bible hallelujah hallelujah or we could we have to skip we have to skip what about Esther what about ES sadly she had no father and no mother she was an orphan raised by her raised by her or raised by the uncle of morai no inheritance no father no mother birth didn't matter but one day one day church at the 10th year at the 10th month of the seventh year of the reign of a in the days of the voice of the seventh angel Revelation 107 at the 10th month of the seventh year go to Esther too you can find it something something changed something changed a King married Esther is that okay when I say that okay it was never his daughter aerus had many daughters had many sons but there was only one Queen hallelujah it's very plain all of you people that know that you need to be born again all of you people that need to you know you need to be saved that all you need to have the ghost it's very plain why God has to send a message to you because what you have received right now is not enough to make the rapture Hallelujah isn't that beautiful Hallelujah and what an inheritance Esther was stepped in church we have to come to the close amen so we have to come to an end you could go to all the scriptures from Israel how Israel God was showing them I am your maker then Isaiah tells them your maker is also your savior and then he didn't stop he didn't stop then Isaiah tells Israel You're is also your husband hallelujah [Music] hallelujah if I had time this the word is full of itch the Bible is full of it the message is full of it what God has done in this day how God is trying to lift up the relationship it's not only calling you out of denomination it's trying to come back and unite yourself with him the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom the Earthly bride and there is no Union taking place when before not a marriage happens there should never be a union come on Church there should never be a union before a marriage takes place this is what Satan is trying to do he's trying to take you young ladies he's trying to make a mother out of you you become wife of some God is not prating a a woman that he did not marry before Hallelujah this is the marriage of the Lamb rejoice and be glad H do you have few minutes few minutes in Esther 2:7 you see a woman that has no father and no mother that's Esther Esther 2 ver7 brought up hadasa that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the mate was fair and beautiful obviously her father and her mother could not leave her any inheritance in Esther 5 verse three when we have that Esther 5 verse3 now this is now after Esther is married then said the king unto her what wil thou Queen Esther and what is thy request it shall be even given thee to half of the [Music] Kingdom Queen is it clear what half of the Kingdom means the king said one half belongs to me and the other half belongs to you only Together We Are One Kingdom other words the king said you are co-equal with me this is my relationship that's why I married you to share my kingdom with what an inheritance what an effect it had are you ready let's turn quickly to Nehemiah Nehemiah Nehemiah chapter 2 verse [Music] 6 if you take the whole book of Nehemiah you know it's a very the story of Nehemiah rebuilding the temple and the walls and here in Nehemiah listen he nemiah go goes to that King that married Esther AOS also name just watch how God is doing things the restoration of the temple yes h right come on Church restoration of the Bride tree he brought Esther to be married to a King that that King that kingdom was involved to give permission to nemiah and his God God knows how to do things he knows how to place you I remember it was four or five years ago 10 years 10 years ago we were on the Fiji islands there's a nice group nice group of people wonderful Believers Church double at three times as much as this on the whole island and they had the new building a new church building and as it was in that time there were so many oppositions in rebuilding the temple so many problem came to that amen they troubled from the government people had left the church they had caused trouble finally we came to the opening of the church I was invited to preach the open a big church where all the people from the Fiji Island can get together absolutely a blessing of the Lord a day before they had a letter from the government you're not allowed to have that opening because of this has a claim and that has a CLA but you know what had happened one brother in the church in his years before he became the personal bodyguard of the president and he was such a loyal man he he saved the life of the president once a message believer a wonderful brother very skilled man very strong man there was once a coupe in Fiji and he and he took the president run with him on the sea hiding in boats and saved the life of the president all that had happened and now this trouble arose the government was against finally the brother said it's enough now he found the he found the president he said Mr President and the president knew him he said President we have so much trouble we cannot open our church because there too many trouble you know what the President says your words is my words if you have any trouble they must call me [Music] next day we had the opening of the church nobody could say [Applause] nothing God knows how to do things church and watch God knew exactly what would come that's why God placed Esther next to our for us bring bring Nehemiah 2 ver6 and the King said unto me and what what the Bible said the queen also sitting by him history tells us that that Queen should be [Music] Esther what an inheritance your relationship defines your inheritance and the Rapture is only for the bride now we close with that scripture want you bring that up please what we Genesis 524 show you the mystery of the translation of Enoch why Enoch was raptured he walked with God are you walking with God are you walking in step of the word who is Walking with God today not walking with the god of yesterday not walking in the light of yesterday if we walk in the light as he is in the light there is forgiveness for sins is that right if we walk in the light as he is in the light oh my we could spend another hour there I tell you I give you a few quotes you can choose them at home brother speaks of Noah and of Enoch Noah and Enoch amen right normally between Noah and Enoch is gap of 70 years it's a gap according to the Bible you can read when Noah was born was born was born between Enoch and Noah was a gap of 70 years you can read it for yourself listen what brother bam said he said Enoch and Noah preached [Music] together brother said Noah watched Enoch he said said when Enoch when Noah saw that Enoch was taken up he knew it's time to go into the ark the other quotes I don't give you ah the Bible said how long walked Enoch with God when the bring the Bible he walked 365 years he walked with God is it right you know what brother bam said how many years he worked with God 500 there's something special about Enoch there's something special about this bride yes many have made calculations based on the word of the Bible remember brother brandham he took things of the Bible and he said according to my looking at things about 1977 is that right somebody can say Amen you all know that not only once brother said that he said I can miss that that's why he said I do not prophesy or predict or prophesy but as a student of the Bible do you know said there's a great difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ [Music] but we are living not in the second appearing in the second [Music] coming what is the difference between the appearing and the coming the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen hallelujah aen the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Ram said he first takes first Thessalonians he said when he is taken out of the way then the Antichrist will be manifest fully that mean he is holding it back brother said that he is the church that he is the bride that is her inheritance Hallelujah am remember brother Bram 60 years ago he would tell his people God allow me to tell you you are forgiven and only God can forgive I want to say again brother told his people God allowed me to tell you you are forgiven and only God can forgive it was not brilliant Brandon forgiving it was God through William br Hallelujah am my special person that Enoch special person that that's the scripture please yes Genesis 5:24 you can bring it and with that I'm closing I'm just closing my Bible watch beautiful and Enoch walked with God are you walking with God who is Walking with God that means you're not stagnating you're walking with him move with the spirit this is what God wants his people to do move with the spirit move with the time listen the Bible said and he was not he was translated he was changed you know what he was changed the reason why he was changed the reason why he was translated the reason why he was raptured is for God took him that word took means in the Greek no in the Hebrew it means to take possession to select to choose to marry to Mary that means for because God married [Music] Enoch that's why he was not Hallelujah there you see what happened there a secret to Enoch he went to the process can we say that you see the pyramid that you can understand knew the mystery of salvation but then came a time when he walked with God God was so pleased Hallelujah and God is so was so so pleased with his bride he comes back to church said I don't call you church I call you [Music] bride and because God came down in this day for marriage Revelation 10 is a marriage Revelation 101 is Christ 107 is brother brandham the marriage counselor and 108 is John a type of the bride and 108 to 11 as it was in the Garden of Eden prise the Lord can we say praise the Lord can praise the Lord let us rejoice not let us be said not let us be said let us
