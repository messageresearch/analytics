[4:58] Oh,
[5:02] I will pray to my God.
[5:06] Oh,

[5:15] and lift my eyes to the east.
[5:20] From where cometh thy faith we wait on
[5:25] you Jehovah never fails.

[5:33] I will pray to my God.
[5:37] Oh,
[5:41] let us go on and lift my eyes and lift
[5:47] my eyes to the heels
[5:51] from when cometh him with faith we wait
[5:55] on you till just speak to him in your
[5:59] own way. Speak to him and tell him,
[6:01] "Lord, I come before your presence this
[6:04] morning, Lord. Father, I'm not clean. I
[6:08] come before your presence this morning,
[6:10] Lord. I'm not worthy. I come before your
[6:14] presence, Lord, this morning. I'm just
[6:16] as I am, Lord. But, Father, I want to
[6:20] thank you, oh God. Your word has taught
[6:22] us this morning that Hezekiah came back.
[6:26] Oh father, when you told him he was
[6:29] going to die, he said, "Oh God, have I
[6:32] not served you with a faithful heart? Oh
[6:35] God, have I not obeyed your commands?
[6:39] Father, be merciful to me. Lord, I want
[6:43] to be that Hezekiah this morning, Lord.
[6:46] May you have mercy and compassion upon
[6:48] me, Lord. all my weaknesses, Lord. All
[6:52] my shortcomings, oh heavenly father,
[6:54] Lord, I'm thankful this morning, Lord,
[6:57] because you are that friend, oh Lord,
[7:00] who never forsakes me. Oh Lord, you are
[7:03] that friend when other friendships
[7:05] cease. You are that friend when my job
[7:08] is no more. You are that friend, Lord,
[7:11] when my neighbors forsake me. You are my
[7:14] friend, oh God, when I'm sick, when I'm
[7:17] ailing and dying. You are that only
[7:19] friend, oh Lord, who restores, oh God,
[7:23] who comes and gives me strength in a
[7:25] fading body. You are that same God, oh
[7:28] king of glory. You said, oh God, in your
[7:31] word that even if your sins be as red as
[7:35] crimson, come and I wash them white as
[7:38] snow. Father, this morning we are coming
[7:40] before your presence, Lord, presenting
[7:43] ourselves, oh God, not because we are
[7:46] righteous, oh God, but because the
[7:49] fountain, oh God, it flows daily. Oh
[7:52] Lord, the fountain flows with power, oh
[7:55] God. The fountain cleanses us, oh God.
[7:58] The fountain forgives us, oh Lord. Have
[8:01] mercy, oh God, this morning, upon every
[8:04] sinner in your sanctuary, Lord. May you
[8:07] forgive us, oh Lord. May you cleanse us,
[8:10] oh heavenly father. May you pour out
[8:12] your Holy Ghost this morning, Lord, upon
[8:15] them children, Lord, who are calling
[8:17] upon thy name this morning. May you set
[8:20] free, oh God, them that are bound, oh
[8:22] heavenly father, lose, oh king of glory,
[8:26] every person, oh God, that is bound this
[8:28] morning, that we will have the liberty,
[8:30] oh God, we will have, oh Lord, the
[8:34] freedom to praise and worship you this
[8:36] morning. We want to invite you, oh Holy
[8:39] Spirit, this morning that you'll come
[8:41] and speak to our hearts, oh God. We want
[8:44] to invite you, heavenly father. May you
[8:46] come and anoint the word, oh Lord. We
[8:49] pray that you come down, heavenly
[8:51] father, this morning, Lord. May you
[8:53] anoint our hearts, oh God. May a fire
[8:56] burn within us, Lord, this morning,
[8:58] Lord, to hear from thee, oh God. May we
[9:02] be forgiven, Lord. May we be
[9:05] re-energized in your presence, oh Lord.
[9:08] Speak to us, oh God. Encourage us in
[9:11] your word this morning, Lord. Oh, we
[9:13] love you, Lord. Because our help comes
[9:16] from you, oh Lord. We look to thee, oh
[9:19] Lord. Our help comes from nowhere but
[9:22] you, oh Lord. Our help in time of
[9:25] trouble, Lord. A present help in need.
[9:28] Oh Lord, we thank you, Lord. We bless
[9:31] your holy name.
[9:33] We glorify your name.

[9:41] I will pray to my God.

[27:29] alone learning to lean as the pastor
[27:31] comes. Learning

[27:54] Oh, I'm gaining
[27:58] more power
[28:02] than I ever
[28:05] dream.
[28:07] I am

[28:16] [Music]
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Are you learning to lean on him this
[28:21] morning?
[28:23] Amen. You may be seated.
[28:27] So I greet you in the precious name of
[28:28] our Lord Jesus.
[28:31] And it's a great blessing to be in his
[28:33] presence.
[28:35] Amen. Amen.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; We are in a as I always say in a time of
[28:40] transition.
[28:43] And now transition is when two
[28:47] uh different phases kind of merge
[28:52] together.
[28:58] And I appreciate God
[29:01] that brother James has really been very
[29:04] effective in this.
[29:08] He has been able to catch up quickly.
[29:14] You know when you look at some of the
[29:16] great stories in the Bible,
[29:19] it is around 17 years
[29:23] when David killed Goreas.
[29:27] He was just a little lad, a little boy.
[29:31] And then you know we can look back
[29:36] and from the time when he was anointed
[29:38] by Samuel
[29:41] to the time when he went to the wall
[29:45] was about five or six years.
[29:48] So he was anointed at around 12 years
[29:53] and then he was able to kill Goras.
[29:57] And all that is now a time of
[29:59] transition.
[30:03] He has been anointed to be king
[30:06] at 12 years. But he takes the throne
[30:11] at 30 years. You see it is very
[30:14] interesting
[30:16] that after the killing of Goras
[30:21] that is about uh it took another seven
[30:24] and a half years
[30:27] and he was reigning over Judah
[30:31] and he had taken over the 10 tribes.
[30:42] So at 30 years he unified the entire
[30:46] Israel.
[30:49] So it was 18 years
[30:52] when the gift of a king
[30:54] was being formed.
[30:57] Isn't that a long time?
[31:00] Yeah. A lot of things come
[31:02] during the time of the transition.
[31:06] And you see when you look at men like
[31:08] Elisha,
[31:11] you know, he gets the mantle of Elijah
[31:16] parted on him and he felt the anointing
[31:21] and he began to fall for about eight
[31:23] years
[31:26] and then the mantle of Elijah fell on
[31:29] him.
[31:31] But it took another 10 years
[31:34] to fit into that matter.
[31:37] So the transition is always a long time.
[31:41] But we appreciate that in that period of
[31:44] time, God is preparing the mind of the
[31:48] man going to take over
[31:52] and even the mind of the people that are
[31:54] going to receive it.
[31:57] So we appreciate God.
[31:59] that he has been able to merge the two
[32:01] together.
[32:04] Amen. Amen.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; You know, we just appreciate God for
[32:08] that.
[32:10] And one thing I say is that I am blessed
[32:17] to have a pastor.
[32:19] Amen. Amen. Don't you say the same thing
[32:21] today?
[32:23] It's a blessing to have a pastor,
[32:26] a man who cares for your soul.
[32:30] Amen. Amen.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; So I want to greet everyone of you
[32:34] and welcome you to the house of the Lord
[32:38] and I want to say what a blessing it is
[32:42] to be called the sons of God.
[32:45] You know I thank God for my family.
[32:49] Amen. They are all here this morning.
[32:55] Amen. Amen. you know, except two of
[32:59] them.
[33:02] Amen. Amen.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; I think three of them.
[33:06] Uh my son-in-law John,
[33:13] &gt;&gt; my son-in-law Reuben,
[33:16] and then my granddaughter.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; They are the only three that are not
[33:24] here with us.
[33:26] But the entire family is here.
[33:29] All my four daughters are here this
[33:31] morning.
[33:34] Amen. And the six grandchildren are
[33:38] here.
[33:40] The one missing is
[33:43] Amen.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; So we certainly appreciate
[33:47] that God is good to us.
[33:51] Amen. Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; I've got brother Sam here, my
[33:54] son-in-law.
[33:57] Brother William,
[33:59] I really appreciate my family.
[34:02] Amen. Amen.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing for God to give you a
[34:07] family that serves the Lord.
[34:11] It's a special grace
[34:14] and I want to say
[34:17] you may not be able to understand that
[34:22] until you have grown children.
[34:27] When they are very young, you can always
[34:30] command them around.
[34:33] But when they are grown and they remain
[34:36] under the inspiration you placed them,
[34:40] it's a great blessing.
[34:43] Amen. Amen. So of recent,
[34:47] I was caring for the back condition of
[34:49] my wife.
[34:53] So attending to her at home,
[34:56] I was the one doing everything she
[34:58] wanted to have
[35:02] and taking her to hospital three times a
[35:05] week.
[35:07] And while we did that,
[35:10] a little Remma became sick.
[35:14] She got me and she could not continue at
[35:16] school.
[35:19] I had to attend to her also
[35:22] because her mother was in Nairobi.
[35:26] So my wife in the circumstance
[35:30] wrote me a heartwarming message.
[35:35] You know it's very interesting. You stay
[35:37] in the same room,
[35:40] but somebody chooses
[35:43] to write you a message
[35:46] and she says, "Thanks
[35:48] for taking care of me.
[35:52] May the Almighty God bless you,
[35:56] reward your love for me,
[36:01] the girls,
[36:03] the grandchildren,
[36:05] and especially Yadel,
[36:08] your labor is not in vain.
[36:11] God sees all your sacrifices
[36:15] and he rewards his faithful children.
[36:19] I loved that.
[36:24] Praise the Lord. Yeah. You know, it's
[36:27] nice to stay in a home
[36:31] when your friends
[36:33] is not a man having a woman in the
[36:36] house,
[36:38] but a man having a wife in the house
[36:43] who fits in what a wife must be.
[36:47] and I appreciate my wife
[36:50] for the last 45 years.
[36:53] Amen.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; So before we can continue,
[36:58] I think you know uh
[37:02] the little girls here admiring that.
[37:09] God bless you. The musicians you can
[37:11] come
[37:15] give us one song and we can get into the
[37:18] word.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Have you come to church?
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Have you come to church?
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; So when you come to church,
[37:29] you act to church.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Feel happy. Worship God.
[37:37] Say how great he is.
[37:40] Amen. Brother Brham says in message
[37:44] experiences,
[37:46] don't be late at your church.
[37:51] You who have to go to church,
[37:54] you get right on.
[37:58] Did you hear the admonition of the
[37:59] prophet?
[38:02] Don't be late at your church.
[38:07] How many know that this is your church?
[38:11] Don't be late at your church.
[38:17] You who have to go church,
[38:21] you get right on. Okay.
[38:25] God bless you as we get to hear from
[38:29] these brethren.
[38:38] [Music]
[38:52] [Music]
[39:00] God.
[39:08] At night I lay in bed
[39:12] and I
[39:14] [Music]
[39:15] begin to cry.
[39:20] [Music]
[39:23] And my mind just fails
[39:27] to know
[39:29] exactly
[39:32] why.
[39:37] I can't explain
[39:40] with tongue or pain.
[39:44] The spirit's groing
[39:48] deep
[39:50] within.
[39:52] It must be
[39:56] here in my soul.
[39:59] As I feel
[40:02] the pool,
[40:06] I feel
[40:09] the
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[40:14] I hear the call.
[40:20] [Music]
[40:22] And I know his spirit's
[40:26] moving
[40:28] me
[40:29] to give my all
[40:39] to me.
[40:41] [Music]
[40:42] Oh,
[40:44] and I
[40:46] agree.
[40:50] [Music]
[40:52] Lord, please come and take
[40:57] on shore.
[40:59] I feel the poor.
[41:07] I went to hear the word
[41:12] and we
[41:14] each line and phrase.
[41:22] He was drawing me
[41:26] to give
[41:28] a higher
[41:31] praise.
[41:36] These are deep.
[41:40] Cold to the deep
[41:44] like a great magnet
[41:47] pulling
[41:49] me.
[41:51] I know for sure
[41:55] that I receive
[41:58] cuz I feel
[42:01] the
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[42:05] I feel the
[42:10] praise God.
[42:12] Oh, I hear the call
[42:21] and I know his spirit is moving
[42:26] me to give my all.
[42:35] His speak to me.
[42:41] Oh,
[42:42] and I
[42:45] [Music]
[42:50] Lord, please come and take on joy. I
[42:57] feel the P.
[43:04] I feel the P.
[43:10] Oh,
[43:12] I hear the call
[43:20] and I know his spirit is moving
[43:25] me
[43:27] to give my heart.
[43:31] He speaks to me. He speaks to me.
[43:38] [Music]
[43:39] Oh,
[43:41] and I
[43:43] am free.
[43:48] My Lord, please come and take control.
[43:56] I feel the P.
[44:03] He speaks
[44:05] to me.
[44:09] Oh
[44:11] &gt;&gt; and I
[44:16] Lord please come.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Lord please come
[44:22] and take control.
[44:26] I feel
[44:28] the
[44:29] [Music]
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:36] Do you feel the pull this morning?
[44:40] Is something pulling?
[44:43] Amen. That's what we need to feel this
[44:45] morning.
[44:47] If you got a deep on the inside.
[44:51] Amen. Amen. Then you are going to hear
[44:53] from another deep this morning.
[44:56] Deep call to the deep.
[44:59] Amen. So let's stand up. Get into the
[45:03] scripture reading.
[45:06] We shall go to Romans chapter 7
[45:11] and we shall read the first four verses.
[45:15] But before we do,
[45:17] I invite you
[45:20] to a word of prayer.
[45:22] Father,
[45:24] we want to thank you
[45:27] for giving us the grace to come before
[45:29] your presence.
[45:31] The pathway has already been sprinkled
[45:33] by blood
[45:36] and we have come through the blood.
[45:39] We feel we are fresh and clean
[45:44] to come before your presence and we pray
[45:47] Lord that you may receive us with open
[45:50] hands
[45:52] and that you may break of your bread
[45:56] that you may share with us the words of
[45:59] eternal life.
[46:01] Bring our burdens, Lord.
[46:04] All our fears Lord,
[46:07] all our weaknesses,
[46:09] Father, that you may address them this
[46:11] morning.
[46:13] Encourage us. Speak to us. Teach us,
[46:16] Lord, and above all in your word, in the
[46:22] circuits of our hearts.
[46:24] water it with water of the spirit.
[46:29] As father we keep moving
[46:33] along this pilgrim journey,
[46:35] whatever of these words you fulfill,
[46:40] help us remember them
[46:42] and say like those of old
[46:45] that this day this scripture has been
[46:49] fulfilled. We pray for our pastor
[46:53] and all the offices that hold his hand
[46:57] that together you may bless us in Jesus
[47:01] name. Amen. Amen.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. Romans chapter 7 verse one
[47:08] know ye not brethren
[47:11] for I speak to them
[47:14] know the law.
[47:19] That's a very great spring point.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; I speak to those
[47:27] that know the law.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; How that the law has dominion over a man
[47:37] as long as he liveth.
[47:40] Amen. Amen. As long as a man is alive,
[47:45] the law rules over him.
[47:48] And then after showing that the law
[47:51] rules over him,
[47:55] then he singles out a woman out of the
[47:58] man race
[48:02] and tells her, "For a woman which has
[48:06] for the woman which has an husband
[48:10] has is bound by the law of husband,
[48:15] so long as he liveth. Yes.
[48:20] But if the husband be there,
[48:25] she's lose from the law of husband.
[48:30] So there was a law for this. There was a
[48:33] law for that. There was law for
[48:36] everything.
[48:38] And then Paul
[48:40] is bringing forth the law
[48:43] concerning a woman in marriage.
[48:47] So the subject matter here is the woman.
[48:51] She's bound to the law of a living
[48:54] husband.
[48:58] Amen. Amen. Verse three.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; So then if while her husband leaveth,
[49:07] she be married to another man,
[49:12] she shall be called an adult.
[49:15] But if husband be dead,
[49:19] she's free from that law
[49:24] so that she's not an adulteress
[49:28] though she be married to another man.
[49:32] So the death of a former husband
[49:37] releases this woman
[49:39] to be married to another.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[49:44] Yes sir. Verse four.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, my brethren,
[49:50] &gt;&gt; you also are become dead to the law by
[49:55] the body of Christ.
[50:00] So now Paul
[50:02] changes the tone
[50:07] and he talks to you as a woman
[50:11] which is the bride of the Lord Jesus
[50:13] Christ.
[50:15] Are you together with me? So he says
[50:18] wherefore my brethren
[50:21] you also are become to the law by the
[50:24] body of Christ.
[50:28] that he should be married to another,
[50:32] &gt;&gt; even to him who is raised from the dead,
[50:38] &gt;&gt; that we should be, I mean, we should
[50:41] bring forth fruit unto God.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; God bless the word that has been read.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Do you love him this morning?
[50:57] I've got a very interesting title here.
[51:02] We all know that brother Brandham taught
[51:04] the message invisible union.
[51:10] But this morning,
[51:12] I want to speak on the mind
[51:17] behind the invisible union.
[51:21] Amen. Amen. So Paul takes a junction
[51:24] here.
[51:26] and brings in the church.
[51:30] Therefore, this part of scripture
[51:33] uses a natural marriage
[51:37] to help us to understand
[51:41] that after the law,
[51:44] the church was free
[51:47] to be married to another
[51:50] and the other is Christ
[51:54] so that we may bring forth fruit unto
[51:56] him.
[51:58] Are you together with me? Okay. So the
[52:02] law is out of the way.
[52:05] So what is in the way now?
[52:09] It is grace. So when I preach grace
[52:13] I am not promoting sin whatsoever.
[52:18] Are you together with me? but rather
[52:21] that grace is the pathway
[52:25] to our eternal salvation.
[52:29] The grace failed I mean the law failed
[52:33] and therefore grace came.
[52:36] Amen. So grace is the strength of God
[52:42] to bring a person
[52:45] to living the life of Christ.
[52:48] Amen. So there is no other way we can be
[52:51] saved
[52:53] and sustained in our salvation
[52:57] except by grace.
[53:00] And this eternal grace
[53:03] will walk a man through his
[53:04] justification.
[53:08] Amen. Then lead him into his
[53:10] sanctification
[53:12] by keeping him in the word.
[53:16] As long as a man saved by grace
[53:21] will keep himself in the word,
[53:24] that man will be sanctified
[53:29] to the intent that he may be filled with
[53:32] the Holy Ghost.
[53:35] Amen. Are you together with me? Yeah.
[53:38] That's what we are supposed to be.
[53:42] that when the Lord died,
[53:45] the church was free
[53:48] to be married to another husband
[53:52] and that husband
[53:54] is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[53:57] So, brother Brham
[53:59] uses Romans chapter 7
[54:03] to teach
[54:05] the invisible union.
[54:09] And I want to title this message
[54:13] The mind
[54:16] behind the invisible union.
[54:19] The mind which brother Brham had
[54:23] while he was teaching the invisible
[54:25] union.
[54:27] The mind is a thought
[54:30] that drives the direction of the
[54:33] objective.
[54:36] Well, we can call it the concept.
[54:41] The concept is a standing picture
[54:46] that is that stands in the mind of a
[54:49] minister.
[54:51] And while the minister is preaching,
[54:55] he's having every area of his effort
[55:02] to kind of paint that concept before
[55:05] you.
[55:07] to paint the reality of the picture.
[55:12] So, brother Brham who understood the
[55:15] Bible,
[55:16] he understood it because he always went
[55:20] behind the mind of the writer.
[55:26] He could not go by what he saw the
[55:28] letters were,
[55:32] but he went behind the writer's mind.
[55:37] Because listen here, this is an old
[55:41] woman.
[55:44] She's about 75 years old.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; And there is a young king
[55:50] called me.
[55:52] And now when you know uh uh David was uh
[55:57] uh out of the kingdom because of the
[56:00] pressure of famine.
[56:04] I mean Abraham rather.
[56:08] And now he goes out there.
[56:11] He goes with his wife Sarah.
[56:14] Are you together with me? She was not a
[56:16] young girl. She was an old woman. But
[56:20] this young king
[56:22] admired this woman.
[56:25] And brother Brham says for Sarah to have
[56:30] a child
[56:32] to reverse her age.
[56:37] Are you together with me?
[56:39] &gt;&gt; You see, he was really understanding the
[56:42] Bible
[56:44] was getting behind
[56:47] the righteous man.
[56:50] So the letter
[56:52] without an abstract idea to it kills.
[56:59] So we must teach the life behind the
[57:02] word.
[57:05] So in the natural aspect
[57:08] we sometimes fail
[57:11] to paint the concept
[57:14] by a natural vocabulary.
[57:18] That's why you must get in the spirit
[57:22] that you may not just listen to the
[57:25] words you are hearing
[57:28] but trying to get behind
[57:32] the minister's mind
[57:34] and see what the spirit spoke to him.
[57:39] Amen. so that you may listen to this
[57:41] minister
[57:44] by the concept
[57:47] like John says
[57:50] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[57:53] then I heard if he was in the not in the
[57:56] spirit he would have not heard if you
[58:00] want to understand what I speak this
[58:02] morning
[58:04] it's necessary to get in the spirit
[58:09] and Be like a John.
[58:12] Like a John. Now let me tell you
[58:14] something.
[58:16] If you come to church to hear me, you'll
[58:20] stop at my word.
[58:24] But then you don't have an interpreter.
[58:28] But if you come to church in the spirit,
[58:32] are you together with me? You will not
[58:34] only hear me,
[58:37] but you will hear.
[58:39] And the interpreter
[58:41] will interpret
[58:43] what you're hearing.
[58:45] Because the same interpreter
[58:49] that will interpret for you is the same
[58:52] one who brought it as revelation to the
[58:55] preacher.
[59:00] Amen. Amen. So if you enter
[59:03] and get it
[59:05] from the teaching of the spirit
[59:09] You will be getting revelation.
[59:12] You will not be hearing the word of
[59:14] knowledge.
[59:16] Are you together with me? You'll be
[59:18] hearing revelation.
[59:21] So by being in the spirit, you catch the
[59:24] word
[59:26] by the concept
[59:28] and not by the letter.
[59:31] You begin to see a stunning picture
[59:35] that the minister was looking at.
[59:38] as you try to labor
[59:41] to bring forth the message. So the
[59:44] concept here
[59:46] is like the full crumb
[59:49] or a pivot point
[59:52] where you know this arm
[59:55] can move this way can move that way. If
[59:59] it didn't have this focus
[1:00:02] wouldn't be able to move easily.
[1:00:06] Amen. Amen. The concept of this message
[1:00:08] today
[1:00:11] is the invisible union.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; In church, we've got different husbands
[1:00:22] and uh different wives to different
[1:00:25] husbands.
[1:00:29] Amen. I'll take one example.
[1:00:33] Brother Mutambbo here is married to her
[1:00:36] sister Julia.
[1:00:39] I don't want to bring them here again.
[1:00:42] But if I do, what's the problem?
[1:00:46] Brother, come here. Where is your wife?
[1:00:50] Come here. Clap for them as they come.
[1:00:53] [Applause]
[1:01:00] Praise the Lord. Now one day
[1:01:05] I joined these people
[1:01:08] in a marriage union.
[1:01:11] Now they are looking at one another
[1:01:13] smiling.
[1:01:16] Now this man here
[1:01:19] and this woman here
[1:01:22] and united in a marriage.
[1:01:27] But these two here are not an invisible
[1:01:31] union.
[1:01:35] We saw them coming
[1:01:37] like we are seeing them come here.
[1:01:41] They are a visible union.
[1:01:45] So now the prophet
[1:01:49] uses this kind of picture
[1:01:52] of a visible union
[1:01:56] to illustrate an invisible union.
[1:02:00] God bless you.
[1:02:02] [Applause]
[1:02:06] So we are going to take that kind of uh
[1:02:09] avenue as we talk today.
[1:02:14] Romans 7
[1:02:16] Paul uses the example of a natural woman
[1:02:20] while his focus is on the church
[1:02:24] which is liberated from the power of the
[1:02:27] law.
[1:02:31] Amen. So, brother in the message
[1:02:33] invisible union,
[1:02:36] he says now
[1:02:40] in Romans 7
[1:02:43] this message out of here.
[1:02:51] It seems like it's on marriage and
[1:02:54] divorce,
[1:02:57] but it really isn't.
[1:03:00] To me it's a prophecy
[1:03:03] for the church in the last day.
[1:03:08] So while you study the message invisible
[1:03:10] union,
[1:03:13] don't you look for a visible union.
[1:03:18] So the mind behind visual union
[1:03:22] has nothing to do about marriage and
[1:03:24] divorce
[1:03:27] but is a prophecy
[1:03:29] for the church in the end time. So set
[1:03:33] your mind right now.
[1:03:36] So this church moves towards the union
[1:03:41] with the capstone.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the church keeps growing
[1:03:49] from
[1:03:57] service
[1:03:58] to Philadelphia
[1:04:03] and it's growing towards marriage to
[1:04:06] become stone.
[1:04:11] Are you together with me?
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. This is the prophecy of the church
[1:04:15] in the end time
[1:04:18] that in the end time
[1:04:20] there will be an invisible union
[1:04:24] between Christ and the church.
[1:04:27] Are you together with me at the opening
[1:04:30] of the seven seals
[1:04:32] at the sunset mountains
[1:04:35] the Lord himself came down.
[1:04:39] What was happening there
[1:04:42] was now the fulfillment of the message
[1:04:44] of visible union.
[1:04:48] Amen. So this union
[1:04:51] starts building after the death of the
[1:04:54] law.
[1:04:58] But it comes to maturity
[1:05:01] in the end time when we see the
[1:05:03] headstone coming down
[1:05:07] and is crying grace grace grace.
[1:05:14] Why grace?
[1:05:16] Because you cannot save yourself.
[1:05:19] So he comes down to save you and to lead
[1:05:24] you in your sanctification.
[1:05:29] All that is grace.
[1:05:32] Justification is his grace.
[1:05:35] Sanctification is his grace.
[1:05:38] And even the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:43] is his grace.
[1:05:45] Because you don't have the
[1:05:47] righteousness.
[1:05:49] that would really bring down the holy
[1:05:51] God
[1:05:53] but is just coming down saying grace.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? So this
[1:06:03] capstone
[1:06:05] comes after Christ has built the life of
[1:06:09] grace
[1:06:12] in his bride
[1:06:15] by giving her
[1:06:17] what she needs to overcome.
[1:06:22] Hallelujah.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Do you overcome on your own?
[1:06:26] No. God himself
[1:06:29] will give you what you need to overcome
[1:06:33] the enemy.
[1:06:38] Amen.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; He will give you his faith.
[1:06:42] And he says after you take your faith
[1:06:47] upon your faith
[1:06:50] and virtue
[1:06:52] is giving you everything
[1:06:55] that you need to overcome the devil.
[1:06:59] Amen. It is God
[1:07:02] who is going to make sure
[1:07:06] that he that started a good work
[1:07:10] will bring it to completion.
[1:07:12] through your sanctification
[1:07:16] to the change of your life to the b of
[1:07:19] the Holy Ghost to the testimony of
[1:07:22] adoption.
[1:07:24] It will be him.
[1:07:27] He started a good work.
[1:07:29] He will bring it to the end.
[1:07:32] Amen. So the captain comes crying grace
[1:07:36] grace
[1:07:39] and this grace
[1:07:42] as revealed
[1:07:44] in the opening
[1:07:47] of the seven seals.
[1:07:49] Not the grace
[1:07:52] to mean
[1:07:53] this grace.
[1:08:01] But grace
[1:08:03] as revealed
[1:08:06] in the opening of the word.
[1:08:08] Are you together with me? Okay. In the
[1:08:12] message, is this the sign of the enders?
[1:08:17] The prophet says that is some of the
[1:08:20] mysteries
[1:08:22] that this angel is supposed to wind up.
[1:08:27] All the mystery,
[1:08:29] all the mysteries of God.
[1:08:32] So that's paragraph 255.
[1:08:37] And then he begins to name those
[1:08:40] mysteries.
[1:08:42] Then when he comes to verse paragraph
[1:08:44] 258,
[1:08:48] he names one of them
[1:08:51] as the grace
[1:08:53] straightened out.
[1:08:58] Not disgrace
[1:09:01] but real true grace.
[1:09:05] Amen. So in the end time
[1:09:08] true grace
[1:09:10] could not unfold
[1:09:13] if the church
[1:09:15] was still married to law.
[1:09:20] Are you together with me? Yeah. They
[1:09:23] could not mar together.
[1:09:28] And we must understand
[1:09:31] that the law
[1:09:34] was until John the Baptist
[1:09:38] that after that
[1:09:41] grace and truth comes by Christ.
[1:09:46] Amen. And this grace here
[1:09:49] was pouring out.
[1:09:52] Amen. until the end
[1:09:56] in the end of the church ages
[1:10:00] the fullness of God's grace
[1:10:03] is revealed
[1:10:05] with the fullness of atonement
[1:10:09] and then that headstone
[1:10:12] which comes down which is the invisible
[1:10:16] union
[1:10:17] come crying grace grace grace
[1:10:23] So right now the church is not under the
[1:10:27] law.
[1:10:30] And what the people call a legalistic
[1:10:32] preacher
[1:10:35] is not there at all
[1:10:39] because the law
[1:10:42] was given to Moses and it is defined
[1:10:47] defined.
[1:10:50] So we know what the law is.
[1:10:53] If you are not preaching the law
[1:10:57] as defined by Moses,
[1:11:00] then you are not preaching law.
[1:11:04] Because the law has been defined
[1:11:08] as ten commandments,
[1:11:11] as the seven feasts,
[1:11:14] as the judgments,
[1:11:16] like a one caught in adultery was
[1:11:18] stoned,
[1:11:21] like a cutting off the thieving hand.
[1:11:25] Then the society principles
[1:11:36] Thou shalt not love I mean thou shalt
[1:11:39] love thy neighbors thyself
[1:11:43] owe no man anything
[1:11:51] but love one another
[1:11:53] for he that loveth another
[1:11:56] fulfilled the law
[1:11:59] that's now society
[1:12:01] laws.
[1:12:04] And finally, the moral responsibility
[1:12:09] that have not died up to now
[1:12:13] because they are summed up
[1:12:16] in the love of the brotherhood.
[1:12:19] Are you together with me? Praise God.
[1:12:23] Romans 39.
[1:12:26] Be very attentive.
[1:12:30] be in the spirit
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; like a John to catch the word.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Romans 3:9.
[1:12:40] For this, thou shalt not commit
[1:12:43] adultery.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not kill.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not steal.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not bear false witness.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not coveret.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; And if there be any other commandment,
[1:13:02] It's briefly comprehended in this
[1:13:05] saying,
[1:13:09] "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:13:12] thyself."
[1:13:15] So that's the nutshell of the law.
[1:13:20] It is properly defined.
[1:13:23] So if a man is preaching
[1:13:26] and is known to be legalistic,
[1:13:30] And if he's not coming by this law,
[1:13:33] then he's not a legalistic preacher.
[1:13:36] He preaches the commandments of men.
[1:13:42] Are you together with me? He's preaching
[1:13:44] the commandments of men.
[1:13:47] You must you must not you must and you
[1:13:52] must not and bring even some kind of uh
[1:13:56] uh uh measuring tape.
[1:14:01] We said the dress must be 2 in from the
[1:14:04] ankle.
[1:14:10] And then you say where is that written?
[1:14:14] He bring out scripture.
[1:14:17] that ladies must be decent.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; But who has the definition of decent?
[1:14:31] The one who has the Holy Ghost
[1:14:34] understands what decent mean.
[1:14:38] There are certain passions
[1:14:42] that she will throw out
[1:14:45] because that they are not decent.
[1:14:50] They give up the V
[1:14:56] because it's intended to to show the
[1:14:59] split.
[1:15:04] Let them also see.
[1:15:07] Why do you show him?
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; You see what I mean?
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But a person with the Holy Ghost
[1:15:15] will know will know
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; and will say this is too tight for me.
[1:15:22] I I want something that's a little
[1:15:24] better.
[1:15:27] This is too loose,
[1:15:30] you know. I think let it be moderate.
[1:15:35] A person with the Holy Ghost will know.
[1:15:40] I don't have to give you a commandment.
[1:15:43] I just want to teach you modesty
[1:15:47] and that modesty
[1:16:00] can only be done by a Holy Ghost filled
[1:16:03] woman.
[1:16:07] Anybody else cannot be able to do that.
[1:16:11] You don't argue with people.
[1:16:14] The people will know they are lying
[1:16:17] because they in contact with the Holy
[1:16:19] Ghost all the time.
[1:16:22] When they go to the shop to shop for a
[1:16:25] dress, they're in contact with the Holy
[1:16:28] Ghost.
[1:16:34] So
[1:16:36] now
[1:16:38] the law as given to Moses
[1:16:42] cannot live together with grace.
[1:16:46] The law was a husband
[1:16:49] that had to die
[1:16:53] for us to be married to Christ by grace.
[1:16:58] But as I said,
[1:17:00] when I preach sanctification,
[1:17:03] it's not under the law,
[1:17:06] sanctification is part of the unfolding
[1:17:08] of grace.
[1:17:13] Amen. Amen. Because when the Holy Ghost
[1:17:15] comes into the life of a believer,
[1:17:19] one thing he does first is to justify
[1:17:22] this man.
[1:17:24] To justify
[1:17:26] is to make him feel like he never did it
[1:17:29] before.
[1:17:32] God justifies it
[1:17:35] in the times of ignorance.
[1:17:38] As far as the elect is concerned,
[1:17:42] God wked.
[1:17:45] He never saw your past.
[1:17:48] Amen. But as the pastor was preaching
[1:17:51] here last Wednesday,
[1:17:54] When you come under the blood,
[1:17:58] you must keep everything under the
[1:18:00] blood.
[1:18:03] Whatever happens,
[1:18:05] take it back to the blood. That is
[1:18:08] sanctification.
[1:18:10] How will you take it back to the blood?
[1:18:13] Because whatever is not of the word
[1:18:18] is made manifest in the word.
[1:18:22] So when you go to the word,
[1:18:25] you'll always throw off what is not of
[1:18:27] the word.
[1:18:30] That is sanctification.
[1:18:32] It's not of the word for a sister to cut
[1:18:35] off her hair.
[1:18:38] So you retain your hair.
[1:18:41] It's not of the word. for a sister to
[1:18:44] paint her face.
[1:18:47] So you throw it off because you see the
[1:18:50] first woman who did it
[1:18:53] was Jezebel that was fair to the dogs.
[1:18:58] If you have the Holy Ghost, you don't
[1:19:01] need a pastor to come and tell you stop
[1:19:05] painting your face.
[1:19:09] Why? Because the Holy Ghost is the one
[1:19:12] who sanctifies your spirit.
[1:19:16] Amen. If your pastor tells you and you
[1:19:21] stop it, but you are grudging
[1:19:25] blessed you
[1:19:27] need to get into whatever you get into.
[1:19:32] Amen. By the conviction of the Holy
[1:19:35] Spirit himself.
[1:19:38] Amen. Amen. When I preach
[1:19:40] sanctification,
[1:19:42] I'm not preaching the law. Are you
[1:19:45] together with me? Is part of grace. Now,
[1:19:49] Hebrews chapter 8,
[1:19:52] I'm just trying to jump through this
[1:19:54] that we may be able to cover the Lord.
[1:19:58] Hebrews chapter 8
[1:20:01] verse seven.
[1:20:02] The scripture said, "For if that first
[1:20:06] covenant
[1:20:08] had been fruitless,
[1:20:12] then should no place have been sold for
[1:20:14] the second.
[1:20:19] If the first husband,
[1:20:22] the Lord,
[1:20:24] Amen, was perfect,
[1:20:27] then there was no need for another
[1:20:30] husband.
[1:20:32] called grace to take the church.
[1:20:36] But the first husband, the Lord had to
[1:20:40] die first.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what the invisible union
[1:20:46] is dealing with.
[1:20:48] The bride qualifies by sovereign grace.
[1:20:55] Hallelujah. Praise God. The law has
[1:20:58] died.
[1:21:00] They must do, they must not, they must
[1:21:02] do.
[1:21:05] Amen. But then grace comes in and he
[1:21:09] said,
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; I will have mercy
[1:21:13] because I love mercy.
[1:21:16] Are you together with me? And he had
[1:21:19] mercy on you.
[1:21:21] And stems back
[1:21:24] to your election
[1:21:27] because God forneew you.
[1:21:30] from before the foundation of the world
[1:21:33] and fitted you
[1:21:36] with a seed gene of life.
[1:21:39] That's the only thing that God can show
[1:21:42] mercy.
[1:21:44] That gene right there.
[1:21:47] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. He bypasses
[1:21:50] Esau
[1:21:52] who was a good boy to his father
[1:21:55] and picks a sisfied Jacob.
[1:22:00] reflection of grace.
[1:22:05] I have a quote here in the vis
[1:22:09] here is giving an illustration in our
[1:22:12] scripture
[1:22:15] about the law
[1:22:18] and grace and illustrating it like a
[1:22:21] marriage
[1:22:24] and knowledge and divorce.
[1:22:27] This passage
[1:22:29] is seldom preached on
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; because it's more or less pertains to
[1:22:36] like marriage and divorce.
[1:22:43] You know, not many preachers pick Roman
[1:22:46] 7
[1:22:48] because they look at it
[1:22:51] as something that deals with marriage
[1:22:53] and divorce.
[1:22:57] But boy is picking it up to illustrate
[1:23:00] your salvation by grace.
[1:23:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; So the natural marriage here
[1:23:09] is being used as a physical illustration
[1:23:14] to describe our spiritual union with
[1:23:17] Christ.
[1:23:20] So in the first union
[1:23:23] there must be a death first
[1:23:26] before there can be another marriage.
[1:23:29] The first husband
[1:23:32] called Mr. Lo
[1:23:34] that was given to Moses
[1:23:37] and was wedded to the church of Israel
[1:23:42] and to die first.
[1:23:45] And when Israel
[1:23:47] rejected,
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then Christ moved over to the
[1:23:53] Gentiles
[1:23:54] that had no knowledge of the Lord
[1:23:59] to save them but knew not the Lord.
[1:24:05] Are you together with me? So in the
[1:24:08] first union,
[1:24:10] there must be a death.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; So is that union?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; How can she
[1:24:22] be united to another husband
[1:24:25] when another is still alive?
[1:24:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:36] Joshua, come here.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; I want to make it easy.
[1:24:44] Where is
[1:24:48] the woman?
[1:24:53] She loses her name.
[1:24:57] Praise the Lord. I want an illustration
[1:25:03] down here
[1:25:10] so that I can make this clear
[1:25:14] and
[1:25:16] you are going to live.
[1:25:19] You are going to live.
[1:25:24] You are not going to die.
[1:25:27] Now
[1:25:29] this song leader here
[1:25:33] out there on YouTube.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; This is his beautiful wife
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; so that you may know.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:25:44] so this man here
[1:25:47] loves his wife.
[1:25:50] You see them?
[1:25:54] And then
[1:25:56] come
[1:25:58] The travel begins.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; You are not taking her. Just illustrate
[1:26:07] when this man is alive
[1:26:10] and you are trying to take her.
[1:26:15] [Laughter]
[1:26:18] You see what I mean? It doesn't work. It
[1:26:22] creates a battle,
[1:26:24] a conflict between law and grace.
[1:26:28] Because this grace here
[1:26:31] cannot marry her as long as the law is
[1:26:35] still alive.
[1:26:37] Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; But when
[1:26:41] the Lord dies,
[1:26:43] this woman becomes lonely.
[1:26:49] And I'm not going to describe to
[1:26:51] demonstrate.
[1:26:54] Do you understand what I mean?
[1:27:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; I think you understand it very well.
[1:27:06] So in the natural marriage
[1:27:10] until the first husband died,
[1:27:14] she cannot marry
[1:27:16] in the spiritual marriage.
[1:27:19] Unless the Lord died,
[1:27:22] Christ wouldn't have come.
[1:27:25] So the law
[1:27:27] was until John the Baptist
[1:27:31] but after that grace came by grace and
[1:27:36] truth.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; This is the quote here.
[1:27:43] The prophet Paul
[1:27:45] invisible union. here is saying that a
[1:27:49] woman
[1:27:51] cannot marry another
[1:27:54] until her husband is dead.
[1:27:57] She cannot remarry
[1:28:00] as long as her first husband is leaving
[1:28:05] by no circumstance at all.
[1:28:09] She must remain single
[1:28:13] as long as her first band is leaving.
[1:28:17] And if she should do such a thing,
[1:28:22] she shall be called an adulterous.
[1:28:25] I'm speaking of the natural now
[1:28:29] to type with the spirit.
[1:28:34] So that's now the prophet saying.
[1:28:38] Now according to the illustration here
[1:28:42] we are going to look at the death of the
[1:28:45] three husbands.
[1:28:50] The first illustration
[1:28:53] is that if a woman is married
[1:28:56] naturally
[1:29:00] and the husband is still alive
[1:29:03] no chance for another husband.
[1:29:06] There must be a death
[1:29:08] of the first husband.
[1:29:11] And then the second illustration
[1:29:14] is the death of the law
[1:29:18] for grace to come in. The second husband
[1:29:21] is the law.
[1:29:24] Then there is a third husband
[1:29:28] that must die.
[1:29:31] The third husband
[1:29:33] is the old Adamic nature
[1:29:41] with the pleasures of the world.
[1:29:45] It must die
[1:29:48] for the newness of Christ to come.
[1:29:53] Brother Brham says we were born married
[1:29:57] to the nature
[1:30:00] and the character of the first Adam.
[1:30:04] The nature that must die
[1:30:07] for us to be married to Christ.
[1:30:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So three
[1:30:12] husbands must die.
[1:30:15] But in our case now,
[1:30:19] which is the church,
[1:30:21] we are going to concentrate on two,
[1:30:25] the law
[1:30:27] and the fallen nature of Adam.
[1:30:31] For us to be fully married to Christ,
[1:30:35] the law must die.
[1:30:39] And the second thing is that the nature
[1:30:44] that commits sin and is married to sin
[1:30:49] also die.
[1:30:51] Two husbands when they are dead when you
[1:30:55] are fully married to Christ.
[1:30:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you want to
[1:31:00] be married to Christ
[1:31:03] in entire fullness?
[1:31:05] Let us go to Romans chapter 6.
[1:31:09] and verse six.
[1:31:11] Knowing this that our old man is
[1:31:15] crucified with him,
[1:31:19] that the body of sin
[1:31:22] might be destroyed
[1:31:25] that henceforth
[1:31:27] we should not serve sin.
[1:31:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; So you put to death,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. the old man
[1:31:38] that live to sin
[1:31:41] so that sin may not have dominion over
[1:31:44] you.
[1:31:47] This old man here
[1:31:50] is the nature of sin that we inherited
[1:31:54] by the natural birth.
[1:31:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A natural birth
[1:32:01] is possible
[1:32:05] but it comes through
[1:32:08] or it comes with certain attributes
[1:32:13] that is passed on from parent to parent.
[1:32:19] some kind of a DNA
[1:32:22] may be the nature the look
[1:32:26] the behavior
[1:32:28] the ways of Adam
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; which chose sin.
[1:32:34] Amen to redeem his wife.
[1:32:37] Are you together with me? Are you
[1:32:39] together with me this morning? the
[1:32:42] nature of Adam chose a sin
[1:32:45] to redeem his wife. But when he redeemed
[1:32:50] her, he could not get rid of that
[1:32:52] nature.
[1:32:57] So now the children that were born
[1:33:02] took of that nature
[1:33:06] which chooses him.
[1:33:11] So it doesn't matter whether you are
[1:33:14] born and you are hidden in a house
[1:33:18] and you never see anybody
[1:33:21] and food was being brought by robots
[1:33:25] so that you cannot admire any woman.
[1:33:30] And if you are a man, you could not have
[1:33:33] an opportunity to lie to anybody.
[1:33:36] You would still be a sinner by
[1:33:39] representation
[1:33:42] because Adam represented you.
[1:33:45] And all the birth that comes in the
[1:33:48] world
[1:33:50] comes by the possibility of passing on a
[1:33:52] gene
[1:33:56] except by one birth
[1:33:58] which was born of a virgin
[1:34:02] without an interaction of a man.
[1:34:05] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. No wonder
[1:34:08] that was the only life that could redeem
[1:34:11] a man.
[1:34:17] Are you together with me? So this old
[1:34:20] man
[1:34:22] is the nature of sin
[1:34:25] and it must die
[1:34:27] so that the new man
[1:34:30] could be born and the new man after this
[1:34:34] only man is dead.
[1:34:36] He begins to form his life.
[1:34:40] Amen. justification
[1:34:43] sanctification
[1:34:45] best of the Holy Ghost and then then
[1:34:49] comes all the virtuous life of Christ
[1:34:52] for me.
[1:34:55] Praise God.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Go to Ephesians 4:22.
[1:35:01] Ephesians 4:22.
[1:35:04] That you put off concerning the former
[1:35:07] conversation, the old man.
[1:35:14] which is corrupt according to that
[1:35:16] deceitfulness of lust.
[1:35:21] So the old man is corrupt
[1:35:26] and will always lean towards the
[1:35:29] deceitfulness of sin.
[1:35:34] He's deceitful.
[1:35:37] When he's alive,
[1:35:39] he will desire to lie.
[1:35:42] There will be a little bit of malice,
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; envy,
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:50] you know, he will lean towards the wrong
[1:35:52] thing.
[1:35:55] When she goes to the shop,
[1:35:59] she will choose this kind of shoe
[1:36:03] because it will form a form of a a way
[1:36:06] to walk.
[1:36:11] That's what she'll choose
[1:36:14] very high
[1:36:16] will choose
[1:36:18] the dress
[1:36:22] that they have told me to wear. what
[1:36:23] ends here then I'll put on one which
[1:36:25] comes here
[1:36:28] but it will look like plastic upon my
[1:36:31] body
[1:36:35] and then reveal every part of my body
[1:36:38] and if you go two inches
[1:36:43] everything
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; and you see them like
[1:36:47] they cannot stretch their leg
[1:36:52] oh these are designed
[1:36:54] to walk in a certain way
[1:36:57] and that's what a person will choose
[1:37:00] sitfulness of sin.
[1:37:03] But when he put off the old man
[1:37:07] by the new birth and then we constantly
[1:37:10] renew our mind
[1:37:14] by the word,
[1:37:16] then you are referred to as the new man
[1:37:21] in Christ.
[1:37:24] Verse 23 says, "Be renewed
[1:37:30] in the spirit of your mind.
[1:37:33] and that you put on a new man
[1:37:37] which after God
[1:37:40] is created in righteousness and true
[1:37:42] holiness.
[1:37:45] The new man is a creation.
[1:37:49] Hallelujah.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; And creation
[1:37:54] comes by the word.
[1:37:57] Let there be.
[1:37:59] Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; So as you study the word,
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; you are recreating yourself
[1:38:09] every day. There is more of God that's
[1:38:13] created around you.
[1:38:16] Amen. So the first birth
[1:38:20] is your father and mother.
[1:38:22] That's the old man.
[1:38:25] But the new birth
[1:38:27] is the new man.
[1:38:29] And that new man responsed
[1:38:37] in righteousness.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This man here,
[1:38:43] he rejoices in studying the word
[1:38:47] that when he comes to church, he's not a
[1:38:50] stranger to the pastor.
[1:38:52] When the pastor says something here, the
[1:38:55] Holy Ghost will tell you that's the
[1:38:58] message you read yesterday.
[1:39:00] That's the verse you were meditating on
[1:39:02] yesterday. And you always be saying that
[1:39:06] you rejoice in the life of prayer.
[1:39:10] His life pulls towards fellowship
[1:39:13] not going on Sunday clubs
[1:39:17] and women's groups
[1:39:20] chapters rotary clubs you know Sunday's
[1:39:27] day nothing should take it away from you
[1:39:31] there is something in you that you pull
[1:39:34] towards
[1:39:37] that's the new man the new
[1:39:40] loves the brotherhood
[1:39:43] and will produce a nature
[1:39:46] of his parent.
[1:39:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You don't
[1:39:50] struggle
[1:39:51] to walk like your father.
[1:39:54] No. It's natural.
[1:39:57] You don't struggle to walk like your
[1:40:01] father.
[1:40:03] I know one young man
[1:40:06] who talks like his father.
[1:40:09] my grandson.
[1:40:11] You push a chest up to the front
[1:40:15] and you will know that's a
[1:40:18] [Laughter]
[1:40:22] Are you together with him? He doesn't
[1:40:25] struggle.
[1:40:26] He doesn't go to a training.
[1:40:29] But there is a life in him that starts
[1:40:32] coming out.
[1:40:34] Amen. There's a life in you that will
[1:40:37] start coming up as you study the word.
[1:40:42] You are not going to struggle to produce
[1:40:45] the life of your parent.
[1:40:48] Love,
[1:40:49] joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:40:53] gentleness,
[1:40:55] goodness, faith, meekness,
[1:40:59] temperance.
[1:41:01] Paul says against such there is no law.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's no law
[1:41:10] that will cause me to love you.
[1:41:13] It's the life of Christ in me that will
[1:41:16] love you.
[1:41:18] Amen. Hallelujah. It's a lived life
[1:41:22] on the inside
[1:41:24] bearing the fruit.
[1:41:26] Hallelujah.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; I think let's go back a little bit.
[1:41:31] Romans chapter 7.
[1:41:33] Do you love him this morning?
[1:41:36] Amen. And verse 4.
[1:41:40] That scripture.
[1:41:43] Amen. Amen. Romans 7:4,
[1:41:47] the Holy Spirit says, "Wherefore, my
[1:41:51] brethren,
[1:41:52] he also become dead to the law
[1:41:56] by the body of Christ, that you should
[1:41:59] be married to another,
[1:42:02] even to him who is raised from the dead,
[1:42:06] that we
[1:42:08] should bring forth
[1:42:10] fruit unto God,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; mangoes,
[1:42:16] No
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; apples.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; But the life of Christ will begin to
[1:42:22] flow.
[1:42:26] So the allegiance of your mind
[1:42:30] [Music]
[1:42:35] changes from the natural mind
[1:42:38] where we think like all the people
[1:42:42] and you begin to think like a god.
[1:42:47] What dies
[1:42:52] is your nature that dies.
[1:42:55] the old man,
[1:42:57] the traits of your father
[1:43:00] and your mother, they begin to die.
[1:43:05] Amen.
[1:43:09] Are you together with me? I don't say
[1:43:12] that you begin to look different
[1:43:15] but there are certain forced behaviors
[1:43:21] because you come from a certain lining
[1:43:26] I'll say this
[1:43:28] there are certain traits
[1:43:33] that will come
[1:43:35] forced in your life
[1:43:38] because you come from a certain line
[1:43:43] The German behave a certain way,
[1:43:47] the German behave a certain way,
[1:43:50] the Americans behave certain way
[1:43:54] and when you get a German
[1:43:57] and an American, put them together, if
[1:44:01] there's no Christ in them, they clash.
[1:44:11] A friend of mine
[1:44:14] took me to a place and said, "Come here,
[1:44:17] brother Steven.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take you somewhere here
[1:44:22] in a very great castle,
[1:44:27] which was built hundreds and hundreds of
[1:44:30] years
[1:44:33] while the Americans were still living in
[1:44:35] Kenya.
[1:44:39] It's a competition.
[1:44:43] This nation against that nation,
[1:44:46] this tribe against that tribe.
[1:44:50] And some of these things, they get
[1:44:53] forced on you,
[1:44:56] short temper,
[1:45:00] short temper.
[1:45:02] It runs through the family.
[1:45:05] And when you sit down
[1:45:07] to listen to the history of the family,
[1:45:11] oh that great grandfather,
[1:45:14] he killed a person
[1:45:17] had a lot of temper.
[1:45:19] Is that right?
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, those things are true.
[1:45:25] But when Christ comes in, those are the
[1:45:28] things he believe
[1:45:33] in you. That's the killing of the
[1:45:36] nature.
[1:45:38] The killing of the Adamic nature
[1:45:42] is God coming in
[1:45:45] to make you stronger
[1:45:48] by making you weaker.
[1:45:51] He first of all makes you weaker
[1:45:55] because you lose
[1:45:57] all the things you think make you
[1:45:59] strong.
[1:46:02] me. I'm not ashamed. I can tell you to
[1:46:05] your face.
[1:46:07] He takes those things away.
[1:46:10] And you may think you are becoming
[1:46:11] weaker, but he'll make you stronger
[1:46:16] because he'll be giving you his virtuous
[1:46:18] life.
[1:46:23] Have you heard what I said? He'll be
[1:46:25] giving you his virtuous life.
[1:46:30] You learn how to be patient
[1:46:34] instead of blowing up with people
[1:46:38] that's killing that nature.
[1:46:40] That's the nature of Christ
[1:46:43] and be built on this earth
[1:46:46] here now is talking about this husband.
[1:46:52] called the nature of
[1:46:55] she was born
[1:46:58] or married
[1:47:00] connected with her first husband
[1:47:03] the first Adam by the adulterous wife of
[1:47:07] Eve's
[1:47:09] first wife.
[1:47:12] Amen. Amen. But she claims
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; that
[1:47:17] this Adam,
[1:47:19] this first Adam is dead.
[1:47:22] Oh, sure. He died long a time ago.
[1:47:27] I'm reborn again.
[1:47:30] She said, "And I'm certainly married to
[1:47:33] the second Adam, Christ, the word,
[1:47:38] how
[1:47:40] notice
[1:47:42] what she loves,
[1:47:48] what her love
[1:47:51] You want to see who she is in love with.
[1:48:03] Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; You need to look at what she loves.
[1:48:07] for you to know whether the oldic nature
[1:48:09] is dead.
[1:48:14] The movies
[1:48:16] on your phone,
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; the words
[1:48:22] that you use,
[1:48:24] the love
[1:48:27] of the nightclub.
[1:48:30] One time
[1:48:32] I testified to a certain lady with my
[1:48:34] wife.
[1:48:36] She was married to a very famous
[1:48:38] footballer
[1:48:43] in the 70s and 80s
[1:48:47] and she was such a nice beautiful lady.
[1:48:53] Her mother was a believer of this
[1:48:54] message
[1:48:57] and there was a man called Moses in
[1:48:59] Jericho.
[1:49:01] That was the husband. She loved
[1:49:04] nightclub.
[1:49:06] So she kind of believed
[1:49:10] in her heart
[1:49:12] but she was
[1:49:14] you know still bound
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; by the first husband.
[1:49:20] Are you together with her? The first
[1:49:22] husband had so much bound her.
[1:49:26] And so one time she was sleeping
[1:49:30] and she had a dream
[1:49:32] that the end was coming
[1:49:37] and people were getting being bound
[1:49:41] and thrown into the fire
[1:49:44] and bound thrown into the fire. And then
[1:49:48] all of a sudden
[1:49:50] her turn came
[1:49:52] and she was getting bound.
[1:49:56] When she was being thrown into the fire,
[1:49:59] she woke up out of the dream
[1:50:02] and was jumping out of bed.
[1:50:05] So she decided to follow Christ.
[1:50:09] But the man
[1:50:11] Adam
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; was not dead in her life.
[1:50:16] She lived very close to a nightclub.
[1:50:20] So whenever the nightclub would start to
[1:50:22] play,
[1:50:25] she would put on her dancing clothes
[1:50:29] and dress like she was going to the
[1:50:31] nightclub
[1:50:33] and she would dance.
[1:50:40] That's what brother Brandham says.
[1:50:43] Watch what she loves.
[1:50:48] Who is her husband?
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Her own fruits prove what she is.
[1:50:56] Exactly. Shows what she is.
[1:51:00] She was born fast
[1:51:03] to Adam because that's her natural
[1:51:06] birth.
[1:51:09] Hallelujah.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. This here is a servant.
[1:51:16] But the nature of Adam
[1:51:20] is built around the human spirit.
[1:51:24] The human spirit, your choices,
[1:51:28] your desires,
[1:51:30] your reasoning
[1:51:33] are the things that must die.
[1:51:37] Help this one bear the fruit of the
[1:51:40] spirit.
[1:51:42] Okay. So the first influence
[1:51:46] of the fallen nature
[1:51:49] must die.
[1:51:51] Love for the things of the world.
[1:51:54] That's the nature that must die
[1:51:58] justified.
[1:52:00] Yes. But there must be a sanctification
[1:52:04] of your spirit.
[1:52:07] Amen. Listen to stretch of a perfect man
[1:52:11] now.
[1:52:13] Last for money,
[1:52:16] lust for big things.
[1:52:19] Last for popularity,
[1:52:22] these things are dead to the believer.
[1:52:28] Let me count them again.
[1:52:30] Last for money,
[1:52:33] it doesn't mean you must not work.
[1:52:38] I'm sitting at home. You know,
[1:52:41] l for money
[1:52:44] things are dead to the believer.
[1:52:47] No,
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; what we mean
[1:52:50] is the love for money
[1:52:53] to the extent that when you go to work,
[1:52:57] you can misuse your pain
[1:53:00] and it doubles the figures.
[1:53:04] You love the money.
[1:53:06] That's what he means. Last for big
[1:53:09] things.
[1:53:11] It's not bad to have a big house.
[1:53:15] It's not bad to have a big car,
[1:53:19] but do you afford it?
[1:53:21] That's what he's talking about.
[1:53:24] L for popularity.
[1:53:26] Do you put somebody down
[1:53:29] that you may be up? That way of life
[1:53:32] must come, must die.
[1:53:36] All those things are dead to the
[1:53:38] believer.
[1:53:40] Amen. And you are not under struggle
[1:53:44] to change your life
[1:53:46] even when you cannot afford.
[1:53:49] You wait for the opportunity.
[1:53:54] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So as a
[1:53:59] believer, a tent or a cage, we don't
[1:54:02] care.
[1:54:03] a tent or a cottage.
[1:54:09] Why should I care?
[1:54:11] Live or die.
[1:54:14] Sink or drown.
[1:54:17] This is the thing that I am interested
[1:54:19] in
[1:54:21] the kingdom of God.
[1:54:24] Whether I maintain my home, whether I
[1:54:26] maintain my family, whe maintain
[1:54:29] whatever it is, let me maintain Christ
[1:54:33] our hope of glory.
[1:54:37] Then Christ build me up, oh Lord,
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; into this. Let Christ be my head
[1:54:48] that's working through me.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the old husband,
[1:54:55] the lust of the flesh
[1:54:57] must die. We die to the Adamic nature.
[1:55:03] The nightclubs are dead to the believer.
[1:55:06] The versions of the world are dead to
[1:55:08] the believer.
[1:55:11] Even the law
[1:55:13] is dead to the believer.
[1:55:15] The spirits of competition
[1:55:18] are dead to the believer. The spirits of
[1:55:21] marriage
[1:55:22] are dead to the believer.
[1:55:25] That's the nature. The husband of Adam
[1:55:29] nature
[1:55:31] must die.
[1:55:35] God help me
[1:55:39] that I may get into Galatians 2:20.
[1:55:44] that no longer I
[1:55:47] liveth but Christ lives in
[1:55:53] the next
[1:55:55] you know that must die
[1:55:58] is the denominational husband
[1:56:03] God help us
[1:56:09] this husband has a dying life
[1:56:13] if doesn't die easily.
[1:56:17] The denominational husband,
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Israel was redeemed
[1:56:24] from their denomination
[1:56:27] called Egypt.
[1:56:29] But when they were brought into the
[1:56:30] promise,
[1:56:32] they kept their eyes
[1:56:35] on the other denomination
[1:56:38] across the road.
[1:56:42] And they said
[1:56:46] to Samuel, "Give us a king
[1:56:50] that we may dance like that group there,
[1:56:56] that we may also do hard rock.
[1:57:05] And these fingers are tempted. My
[1:57:06] friend,
[1:57:11] you can ask Steen.
[1:57:14] He struggles with his fingers.
[1:57:18] But then his spirit says,
[1:57:21] "Stay in balance.
[1:57:23] Stay in balance.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; You are a child of God." And he says,
[1:57:28] "Amen."
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; You know that husband
[1:57:38] must die.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; We need kings
[1:57:42] that we may be like,
[1:57:48] friends,
[1:57:49] we've got this thing here.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; But when you look at people post
[1:57:58] They forget their believers.
[1:58:03] They post
[1:58:05] they post people,
[1:58:10] you know, they are looking at those
[1:58:11] kings there.
[1:58:13] [Music]
[1:58:15] They've got good music,
[1:58:18] but they are horribly dressed
[1:58:25] and they post them.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; What are they saying? We want to be like
[1:58:31] those people.
[1:58:34] Give us those kings.
[1:58:36] They've never fully come out.
[1:58:41] Amen.
[1:58:44] Give us the cakes
[1:58:47] that would think like those people
[1:58:50] and plan our church like those people
[1:58:58] is old.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Listen to this quote.
[1:59:03] So to be married to the second Adam,
[1:59:05] Christ
[1:59:08] the word, you must separate yourself by
[1:59:12] death
[1:59:15] from your first denominational husband
[1:59:19] because there isn't one of them
[1:59:23] that can take all the word of God.
[1:59:29] Did you hear that?
[1:59:31] You must die.
[1:59:34] Amen. That we fish out a little thing
[1:59:38] and I can be able to tell where you came
[1:59:40] from
[1:59:43] because some of those little things
[1:59:46] when I look at them. They are Baptist
[1:59:49] concepts,
[1:59:51] maybe Catholic concepts,
[1:59:53] maybe Pentecostal concepts.
[1:59:56] And then you know that this one here is
[2:00:00] Jacob's wife
[2:00:03] escaping with the gods of lab.
[2:00:12] Why would you bring those evil gods
[2:00:19] you know just come out come out of her
[2:00:23] my people.
[2:00:25] So the message of Israel reunion
[2:00:29] may have some components
[2:00:31] of marriage and divorce,
[2:00:34] but it's not about marriage and divorce.
[2:00:38] It's about the horning of the church
[2:00:42] [Music]
[2:00:46] at the end time. Everything must be horn
[2:00:49] out.
[2:00:51] The bride will have to hone away.
[2:00:54] Everything that cannot make the stretch
[2:00:57] of the path.
[2:01:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Like the church
[2:01:04] has been horny
[2:01:06] from the wide base
[2:01:09] of Ephesus then smaller
[2:01:14] much smaller smaller to smaller.
[2:01:17] Lord, this you're so small so that the
[2:01:20] headstone can fit.
[2:01:24] Even you as an individual, there are
[2:01:27] certain things that God wants to horn
[2:01:29] out over.
[2:01:31] [Music]
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; He wants to horn them out.
[2:01:36] He knows you are your child is your
[2:01:38] child. I mean, you are his child.
[2:01:41] But you got things
[2:01:44] that don't belong to the kingdom.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; So it takes time with you.
[2:01:53] And sometimes the horning is a bit
[2:01:56] painful.
[2:01:58] He cuts off this. He cuts off that. And
[2:02:02] God is very good. When you are bleeding,
[2:02:06] he gives you a time to heal.
[2:02:09] When you are healed, then he cuts off
[2:02:12] this.
[2:02:14] Then you cry a little bit. He nurses
[2:02:17] you. He gives you a time to heal. That's
[2:02:20] what God is doing. Sanctification
[2:02:24] is not God cutting you down at once.
[2:02:28] God keeps horning you. Sanctification
[2:02:33] is continuous
[2:02:36] until we come to the stage of a perfect
[2:02:43] God is good.
[2:02:46] Now listen to the true Easter Seal.
[2:02:50] Now that's what God is doing to his
[2:02:52] church.
[2:02:54] He's horning off the people
[2:02:57] and making it in such a perfect way
[2:03:02] that when the headstone come
[2:03:05] it fits the building together.
[2:03:09] and then a resurrection of the world
[2:03:11] theme.
[2:03:13] The church is gone up. So he's taking
[2:03:17] the church into the horning
[2:03:21] because when Christ comes down
[2:03:24] Indian time.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:30] First
[2:03:31] in the invisible union
[2:03:35] before the visible union.
[2:03:39] First in the invisible union.
[2:03:43] He must find After the when the the the
[2:03:48] Christian has been home,
[2:03:52] the church has been home,
[2:03:55] the house has been swept.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He wants to come
[2:04:00] into a clean house.
[2:04:03] He's taking the church
[2:04:05] into the horning
[2:04:08] because he must find a fitting spot
[2:04:11] where he can sit.
[2:04:15] Amen. Amen. To take on the whole arm of
[2:04:18] God.
[2:04:20] In this message, the prophet says
[2:04:23] there's no other age to come,
[2:04:26] but he's taking that Pentecostal church
[2:04:30] and taking the elect out of that.
[2:04:35] Taking the elect out of that.
[2:04:39] Out of what? Out of the Pentecostal
[2:04:42] church.
[2:04:44] So we come out
[2:04:47] out of Lisa
[2:04:49] and then he says horning it.
[2:04:53] Who is he horning?
[2:04:56] He's horning the one who has come out of
[2:04:58] organization.
[2:05:00] What is he horning of?
[2:05:03] Everything that belongs to organization,
[2:05:07] he holds it.
[2:05:10] What is he doing?
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; He's killing
[2:05:14] that denominational husband,
[2:05:19] horning it so that when his ed comes
[2:05:21] upon it,
[2:05:25] we have to be like the rest of it.
[2:05:29] So every weight
[2:05:32] that we brought out of Pentecost,
[2:05:35] out of Baptist,
[2:05:37] out of Catholic,
[2:05:39] We throw it out of the window.
[2:05:43] We go to be born
[2:05:46] into this message.
[2:05:49] Amen. Are you together with me? He swore
[2:05:53] by himself
[2:05:54] in this message he says. And when he
[2:05:58] pulls that sinner
[2:06:01] through that blood cell,
[2:06:05] he cleanses him from all unrighteousness
[2:06:10] and brings him in
[2:06:12] by the Holy Ghost into himself.
[2:06:17] And the sinner
[2:06:19] is a new creature in Christ
[2:06:22] baptized in there by the Holy Spirit.
[2:06:25] Pulls him in here.
[2:06:29] And the part of man in there is godly.
[2:06:34] He's the son of God. He's the daughter
[2:06:36] of God.
[2:06:38] And the desires of the world
[2:06:41] is dead.
[2:06:43] between him
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; and the world is the blood of Jesus.
[2:06:51] So you cannot pull those things across
[2:06:53] the blood.
[2:06:57] Amen.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; So between the two husbands,
[2:07:01] the world
[2:07:03] and your nature, they are two.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; I mean the two worlds.
[2:07:12] That's the denominational world and your
[2:07:16] fallen nature
[2:07:18] between you and your foreign nature.
[2:07:21] God push the blood
[2:07:24] between you and your denomination.
[2:07:28] He puts the blood.
[2:07:30] So it's impossible
[2:07:33] anything
[2:07:35] from your natural
[2:07:38] weakness
[2:07:42] God will not want you to cross the
[2:07:44] blood.
[2:07:48] Amen. Anything from organization
[2:07:54] don't pass through my blood. He puts the
[2:07:57] boundary of the blood.
[2:08:01] Are you under that?
[2:08:04] Amen. Amen.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; So I want to get into the message.
[2:08:09] I've already laid down the foundation.
[2:08:13] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:15] Amen. So tie your belts. Now
[2:08:20] you need to take your mind away
[2:08:23] from you know marriage and divorce
[2:08:29] because this is an invisible union.
[2:08:33] It's nothing to do with what we do here.
[2:08:38] When we are marrying these young people
[2:08:39] to one another,
[2:08:42] those are visible union
[2:08:47] where a physical man walks to the
[2:08:48] platform
[2:08:51] with a physical woman
[2:08:53] and they united into marriage.
[2:08:57] So take your mind away from that.
[2:09:00] God does not know you.
[2:09:03] by this.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; God does not you know you by this.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; God knows you
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; by the seed
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; that came from him.
[2:09:19] I've always
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; tried to let you know
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; that man
[2:09:28] was created in the image
[2:09:32] and likeness of God.
[2:09:34] God just cut off a piece of himself
[2:09:39] to make Adam.
[2:09:41] And in Adam was hidden the book of life
[2:09:47] that was supposed
[2:09:49] to multiply.
[2:09:53] Amen. And make children to fill the
[2:09:57] earth. But Adam failed.
[2:10:01] But those sons
[2:10:03] were there predestinated of God.
[2:10:07] Is there a soul store somewhere
[2:10:13] that was created before the foundation
[2:10:15] of?
[2:10:17] No. What is there is the
[2:10:20] predetermination of God
[2:10:25] that so and so will come in this age.
[2:10:30] So and so will come into this age. And
[2:10:34] whenever that age comes,
[2:10:37] those souls
[2:10:39] and those predestinated genes
[2:10:43] which were predestinated of God,
[2:10:46] they come out and take a body.
[2:10:52] But when they enter into the world,
[2:10:56] they enter a fallen world.
[2:10:59] Are you together with me?
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; They get out of the kingdom
[2:11:04] and they are blind to the kingdom.
[2:11:07] That's what Jesus told Nicodemus.
[2:11:10] Unless you are born again,
[2:11:13] you cannot see the kingdom, unless you
[2:11:16] are born again, you cannot enter. He was
[2:11:20] telling Nicodemus
[2:11:22] and Nicodemus
[2:11:24] who was the seed gene on the inside.
[2:11:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; He was the seed chin of Israel.
[2:11:33] When we come here on earth, we are
[2:11:35] blinded by denominationalism.
[2:11:38] We are blinded by the fall of the
[2:11:40] nature.
[2:11:44] Hallelujah. So when God comes
[2:11:48] in every age and sends the word, the
[2:11:52] word is looking for those seeds
[2:11:56] that have been cast in a body of flesh.
[2:12:01] That's what God is looking for. He's not
[2:12:05] looking for this.
[2:12:07] Amen. He'll bypass you.
[2:12:11] If you want a blessing from him,
[2:12:14] he will bless you. If you want healing,
[2:12:17] he can heal you. But when he's talking
[2:12:20] about salvation,
[2:12:22] he's talking about the seed on the
[2:12:24] inside.
[2:12:27] Amen. That egg,
[2:12:30] the egg
[2:12:33] which the mother eagle lost.
[2:12:37] Are you together with me? And when he's
[2:12:40] coming down, he look for this seed.
[2:12:44] He preaches the word.
[2:12:47] And that Jesus,
[2:12:50] it has a memory
[2:12:52] of where it came from. When it hears the
[2:12:55] word, it says, "Amen."
[2:13:01] And the word is not strange.
[2:13:04] Even if you've never heard the word,
[2:13:08] but if you are a seed gin
[2:13:11] came from God and you've never heard the
[2:13:14] word preached in that way, the day you
[2:13:18] hear it, you just feel like you've
[2:13:20] always heard it.
[2:13:23] There is something which tells you
[2:13:24] that's the truth
[2:13:26] and you take it. That's the truth and
[2:13:30] you take it. That's the truth, brother.
[2:13:34] You are an ego.
[2:13:37] The ego that was looking for the lost
[2:13:40] egg
[2:13:42] began to click in a certain way.
[2:13:47] And then this little igllet
[2:13:50] that had suffered in a chicken
[2:13:54] had a voice like this is not new to me.
[2:14:01] And when it tried the voice
[2:14:05] It found out that it could cry like that
[2:14:08] voice.
[2:14:11] The deep calling to the deep.
[2:14:15] There is a deep to answer.
[2:14:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So this little
[2:14:21] igllet
[2:14:23] tries to cry
[2:14:25] and immediately the mother eagle says,
[2:14:29] "You are the seed G. come up yonder.
[2:14:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why you
[2:14:35] are here today.
[2:14:37] That's why you are not in the Catholic
[2:14:39] church in the ugly country. You come to
[2:14:43] the right clicking.
[2:14:46] Amen. So now we are coming to the real
[2:14:50] point. Now
[2:14:52] I pray that the Lord may store this into
[2:14:54] your soul.
[2:14:57] God knows you by your city
[2:15:01] and this is the the the turning point
[2:15:04] here.
[2:15:06] So this union here we are talking about
[2:15:10] is the union
[2:15:13] of your invisible Jesus
[2:15:19] and the invisible God
[2:15:22] coming to unite with it.
[2:15:27] Are you together with me?
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; And now he says here in the invisible
[2:15:34] union,
[2:15:37] excuse me,
[2:15:39] he says, "Oh,
[2:15:41] that spiritual union of Christ and his
[2:15:44] church." Now
[2:15:49] the spiritual union
[2:15:54] of Christ and his church.
[2:16:00] So in this reunion
[2:16:03] is God
[2:16:05] dealing with your seed gene of God
[2:16:09] and not just anoint your flesh
[2:16:14] which can produce emotion
[2:16:18] which is okay
[2:16:20] but going beyond that
[2:16:25] to that CG
[2:16:28] that he predestinated
[2:16:31] to come forth in this age.
[2:16:36] Are you together with me? So, it's more
[2:16:39] than just a little shaking.
[2:16:44] Amen. And then you say that well,
[2:16:48] the path is a mess.
[2:16:52] And then you want to fall
[2:16:55] and you roll
[2:16:57] and you come into a mess.
[2:17:01] No,
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; this is an invisible union.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; Invisible
[2:17:13] union.
[2:17:18] When the Lord comes
[2:17:21] like a thief
[2:17:24] slowly
[2:17:26] catches your soul
[2:17:29] and begins to build it
[2:17:31] and like a thief, he will take you into
[2:17:34] the rapture,
[2:17:37] invisible union,
[2:17:41] and put in his own life
[2:17:45] like the seed in Mark 4.
[2:17:49] When it goes into the ground,
[2:17:52] we know not how it grows,
[2:17:55] but it grows. Anyway,
[2:17:58] invisible union
[2:18:01] to impart life
[2:18:04] in the believer. There was an invisible
[2:18:07] union,
[2:18:09] hallelujah, in the womb of a virgin.
[2:18:15] Are you together with me? and the life
[2:18:17] come up.
[2:18:19] There was no emotion.
[2:18:22] There was no man holding.
[2:18:27] It was just the seed
[2:18:31] coming down to the egg.
[2:18:34] [Music]
[2:18:35] That's the way the Holy Spirit comes
[2:18:36] into the life.
[2:18:41] Now, why do we see people quake?
[2:18:46] I'll give you a quote here. Stretch of a
[2:18:49] perfect man.
[2:18:51] Not it.
[2:18:54] I'm not opposed to emotion.
[2:18:59] But the emotion
[2:19:02] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost are
[2:19:05] two different things.
[2:19:08] And the pastor has been preaching here
[2:19:11] through the church ages
[2:19:14] about the evidence.
[2:19:17] Many people look for the evidence,
[2:19:21] but you may never get
[2:19:24] what you're looking for. And yet you've
[2:19:28] got what matters in your life
[2:19:32] that you already have the baptism of the
[2:19:34] Holy Spirit
[2:19:36] but you are looking for emotion.
[2:19:40] Listen now. A lot of people go to the
[2:19:43] altar
[2:19:45] and pray and say, "Lord, forgive me."
[2:19:49] And a great experience of sanctification
[2:19:55] come upon them.
[2:20:00] Then you have a great time.
[2:20:04] Get up to the altar
[2:20:06] shouting.
[2:20:08] You go back saying,
[2:20:10] Bless God.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; He says, "No,
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; you just started to a place
[2:20:22] where you can grow. You ain't done
[2:20:24] nothing yet.
[2:20:27] The only thing you done
[2:20:30] is just lay the foundation."
[2:20:34] Now, whenever the Holy Spirit comes
[2:20:37] down,
[2:20:39] There is always an emotion.
[2:20:45] Understand me right?
[2:20:49] When the Holy Ghost comes into group,
[2:20:54] not everyone
[2:20:57] that go through an emotion
[2:21:00] has got the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:03] Understand it right?
[2:21:06] Because the Holy Spirit has come down
[2:21:10] among the people. Sometimes as the
[2:21:14] prophet says people get conviction for
[2:21:17] sin
[2:21:20] a great experience of sanctification
[2:21:23] come upon them.
[2:21:27] Then they begin shouting at the oath
[2:21:31] is not saying they got the baptism of
[2:21:33] the Holy Spirit.
[2:21:35] There is a star
[2:21:38] of starring
[2:21:41] when the Holy Spirit many times
[2:21:45] came down in the meetings.
[2:21:48] But there is a difference
[2:21:51] between the baptism
[2:21:54] and these emotions.
[2:21:57] And sometimes
[2:22:00] you already got the Holy Ghost,
[2:22:03] but your problem is you are looking for
[2:22:06] emotions
[2:22:09] which may never come your way
[2:22:13] and you suffer all your time
[2:22:17] and you looking for the Holy Ghost.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:22:27] He is your teacher.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Don't go by experience.
[2:22:35] We've had a prophet messenger in this
[2:22:37] age.
[2:22:40] He has explained those things to us many
[2:22:42] times.
[2:22:45] We know
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; see a great experience of sanctification
[2:22:55] when it comes down it is God
[2:22:59] dealing with your human spirit
[2:23:06] because that's where emotions dwell
[2:23:11] your reasoning
[2:23:13] your emotions,
[2:23:15] your affection,
[2:23:17] your memory.
[2:23:22] You remember how you drank,
[2:23:26] you are now remembering in that that
[2:23:28] time in the witchcraft shrine,
[2:23:35] you are remembering things
[2:23:39] is your human spirit.
[2:23:42] And then you cry
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; in the spirit area
[2:23:49] is where we have all these emotions.
[2:23:53] But the seal of God
[2:23:59] does not come with emotions.
[2:24:03] It's an invisible union.
[2:24:09] That's how we get into marriage with
[2:24:11] God.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; The spirit
[2:24:17] and the natural
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; cannot come into marriage in that way.
[2:24:25] Is only the spiritual
[2:24:29] to the spiritual G.
[2:24:32] That's when the Holy Spirit
[2:24:35] can bond
[2:24:38] to produce fruit.
[2:24:42] Listen to this quote.
[2:24:44] And so were you, sons of God
[2:24:49] and daughters of God. Before there even
[2:24:53] was a moon,
[2:24:56] stars or molecule,
[2:24:59] you were sons and daughters of God.
[2:25:03] for you only physical manifestation of
[2:25:06] the attribute
[2:25:09] that was in God at the beginning.
[2:25:13] For there is only one etern one form of
[2:25:16] eternal life
[2:25:18] and that was you
[2:25:21] before.
[2:25:24] Thou is talking about you
[2:25:27] before this.
[2:25:31] Are you together with me?
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; So now when it comes down to the union,
[2:25:38] he's coming to unite with you
[2:25:43] that was
[2:25:45] eternal
[2:25:47] before this.
[2:25:53] We understand it. I'm taking about 24
[2:25:56] five minutes.
[2:26:00] He says, "Neither do you know when you
[2:26:02] was in your earthly father,
[2:26:07] but you are manifested in his image.
[2:26:10] In the image of God, you are made
[2:26:13] and you are manifested for the glory and
[2:26:16] fellowship of God.
[2:26:20] Therefore, as sure as your gene had to
[2:26:24] be in your father
[2:26:28] before your natural birth,
[2:26:30] your spiritual G
[2:26:33] had to be in God
[2:26:37] because you are an expression
[2:26:41] of the attributes of his thoughts
[2:26:46] before the foundation of the world.
[2:26:49] Amen. Amen.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; So your attribute,
[2:26:54] your attribute
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; is not your flesh,
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; but the germ of life.
[2:27:04] That's what you are. And that's what the
[2:27:07] Holy Ghost
[2:27:09] comes to baptize.
[2:27:12] He comes to baptize that seed.
[2:27:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why
[2:27:18] brother Brham says that the Holy Ghost
[2:27:23] can baptize your human spirit
[2:27:26] all the time and still go to hell.
[2:27:34] But if it touches the soul,
[2:27:37] that's where the life is.
[2:27:39] And there is no sensation there.
[2:27:43] one invisible junior
[2:27:47] to produce a spiritual life.
[2:27:51] And this man here then becomes a
[2:27:54] faithful servant.
[2:27:58] Don't go to the bar. He says amen. Don't
[2:28:02] fight. He says amen. Don't do marries.
[2:28:07] He says amen. Why is he getting the
[2:28:09] commands?
[2:28:11] The man at the center there
[2:28:14] has been renewed
[2:28:17] from an old man to a new man. Ephesians
[2:28:21] 2. Before you were born again, you were
[2:28:25] servant to the old man. But after the
[2:28:28] new part, you are now somebody who takes
[2:28:32] control.
[2:28:34] You are married to produce fruit.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. In the visible
[2:28:43] union,
[2:28:45] flesh unites with flesh
[2:28:48] to bring forth fruit, the natural
[2:28:51] children.
[2:28:52] But in the invisible union, the
[2:28:55] invisible God unites with the invisible
[2:28:58] G
[2:29:00] that's in the soul to bring forth the
[2:29:03] fruit of the spirit.
[2:29:05] Is that amen?
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Okay. So the message invisible union
[2:29:11] is not a doctrine but the reality of the
[2:29:15] token life of Christ
[2:29:18] coming down in the end time
[2:29:21] with the seed Jes. And this token life
[2:29:26] is the Lord himself.
[2:29:28] Hallelujah.
[2:29:30] Invisible union
[2:29:32] is the prophecy
[2:29:34] to the church in the end time
[2:29:37] that the Lord himself the invisible
[2:29:41] broken life will come down. And what is
[2:29:46] he coming down for? To look for the seed
[2:29:50] that's on the inside there.
[2:29:54] The Holy Ghost is the high priest
[2:29:58] who walks through, he walks you
[2:30:02] through justification,
[2:30:05] sanctification
[2:30:06] and unites you into marriage with the
[2:30:10] seed gene on this side.
[2:30:13] So you are hidden
[2:30:15] beyond the veil.
[2:30:20] That's where you are and that's where
[2:30:23] God wants to come.
[2:30:26] That's why brother Brham says
[2:30:30] it he says to me
[2:30:33] Romans 7 is a prophecy for the church in
[2:30:39] the last day.
[2:30:41] It's the Lord himself
[2:30:45] coming down first
[2:30:48] into your soul to seal you.
[2:30:53] Then second, he comes to the church to
[2:30:58] bring the life of the word into the
[2:31:00] church.
[2:31:03] Now let's go to first Thessalonians
[2:31:05] chapter 4
[2:31:10] verse 16.
[2:31:12] For the Lord
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; himself
[2:31:17] shall descend
[2:31:19] from heaven with a shout,
[2:31:22] with a voice of an archangel,
[2:31:26] and with the trump of God,
[2:31:29] and the dead in Christ shall rise fast.
[2:31:33] that is the invisible union.
[2:31:37] The prophecy
[2:31:38] for the church in the last day,
[2:31:43] the Lord himself
[2:31:45] at the opening of the seven seals,
[2:31:49] he stood
[2:31:51] at the sunset mountainset
[2:31:54] and at the opening of the seal,
[2:31:58] Christ was being married.
[2:32:02] to his bride,
[2:32:04] the church, an invisible union.
[2:32:08] He's here to find a bride
[2:32:12] that would seal
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; into the true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:32:18] Amen. Amen. He says by visible union,
[2:32:22] the coming down
[2:32:24] of that headstone,
[2:32:28] what was it coming to?
[2:32:35] to the bride that's ready
[2:32:39] for marriage.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Listen, do you love him?
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; I know you do.
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus is giving us this now.
[2:32:52] Jesus is giving us this description of
[2:32:54] himself
[2:32:56] in relation to the last age.
[2:33:00] The days of grace
[2:33:02] are winding up. He has looked from the
[2:33:06] first century
[2:33:10] right through the 20th century
[2:33:13] and told us all things
[2:33:15] concerning this age.
[2:33:18] Before he reveals the characteristics of
[2:33:20] the last age to us,
[2:33:24] he gives us one final look.
[2:33:29] at his own glorious and supreme duty.
[2:33:34] This is the capsule revelation of
[2:33:36] himself.
[2:33:38] [Applause]
[2:33:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, thus
[2:33:42] says the amen
[2:33:46] because this is where we are in the
[2:33:48] final work
[2:33:51] of the church.
[2:33:53] Amen. Amen.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen?
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, we are praying for this
[2:33:59] food.
[2:34:01] No. Amen. Comes at the last.
[2:34:05] And now to the Loudesian churches,
[2:34:09] identify himself as the
[2:34:16] [Music]
[2:34:18] main.
[2:34:22] Are you together with me?
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; Because I have found my bride.
[2:34:29] through the seven church ages.
[2:34:33] This seven
[2:34:35] which is the last is why I'm saying
[2:34:38] amen.
[2:34:44] That's why there is no other church.
[2:34:47] That's why the next
[2:34:50] is a throne,
[2:34:52] a kingdom.
[2:34:54] So why are we friends?
[2:34:57] Look at what is happening in the world.
[2:35:00] The pastor always talks about it.
[2:35:03] Even in the exaltations,
[2:35:06] look at Israel,
[2:35:09] our calendar.
[2:35:11] Look at Russia. Look at America. The
[2:35:15] whole world
[2:35:17] is becoming a war field.
[2:35:21] We have come to the end.
[2:35:24] Everything which spells amen.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Everything which says life is over.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; The whole world
[2:35:36] has become a global
[2:35:39] sodomite condition
[2:35:44] prophesying
[2:35:46] the end of life.
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; This is where we are. He says thus says
[2:35:52] the amen.
[2:35:54] Jesus is the man of God.
[2:35:57] Jesus is the so let it be of God.
[2:36:02] Amen stands for finality.
[2:36:06] It stands for approval.
[2:36:08] It stands for prevailing promise.
[2:36:12] It stands for the unchanging promise.
[2:36:16] It stands for the
[2:36:19] seal of God.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; So the person
[2:36:23] has come down
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; as the token.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[2:36:33] So right now
[2:36:36] when we talk about the
[2:36:40] invisible union,
[2:36:42] there must be two.
[2:36:46] the eternal CDG
[2:36:52] and the person
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; who is revealing himself
[2:37:01] as the capstone headship to the church.
[2:37:07] So these are the two invisibles.
[2:37:10] The seed in you
[2:37:13] and Christ himself
[2:37:15] coming to baptize that seed
[2:37:18] in their time. The seed
[2:37:22] which is the entire body of Christ
[2:37:25] and then the Lord himself
[2:37:28] coming down as the message of the hour
[2:37:32] to baptize that sea.
[2:37:35] Amen. Let me break it up this way.
[2:37:39] Genesis 1:26.
[2:37:42] As I finish, Amen.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Let us make man in our
[2:37:47] image."
[2:37:49] Amen. and let and after our likeness
[2:37:54] and let them have dominion over the fish
[2:37:56] of the sea
[2:37:58] and over the fall of the air and over
[2:38:01] the cattle and over all the earth and
[2:38:04] over the creeping thing that creepeth
[2:38:06] upon them.
[2:38:08] So the image
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; here
[2:38:12] is Adam
[2:38:15] as an invisible
[2:38:20] He didn't have a body,
[2:38:23] but Adam coming forth as a spirit being.
[2:38:28] So this image
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; is what
[2:38:33] God looks for
[2:38:35] to baptize with the Holy Ghost.
[2:38:39] That's the seed
[2:38:41] he looks for to marry as his wife.
[2:38:47] the invisible union.
[2:38:52] So the union
[2:38:54] is uniting with what?
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; The word.
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; And what's the word?
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; The word
[2:39:03] is the spirit of life.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; So when the spirit of life comes down
[2:39:12] in the end time to anoint and baptize
[2:39:17] his own bride. He's looking for the seed
[2:39:21] Jesus.
[2:39:23] And when he comes down as the revealed
[2:39:27] word,
[2:39:29] the word made alive,
[2:39:32] it's only the bride who has got a
[2:39:35] representation in eternity
[2:39:39] that will say amen.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; So this union
[2:39:46] is a union with the world
[2:39:49] in the uniting time and sign.
[2:39:52] He says God is uniting his bride.
[2:39:56] She is coming together
[2:39:58] from east and from west
[2:40:02] and north and south.
[2:40:04] There is a uniting time
[2:40:07] and that's on right now. What is she
[2:40:11] uniting for?
[2:40:14] The rapture.
[2:40:16] God getting her ready.
[2:40:18] Uniting.
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; What is she uniting with?
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; The word.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; So listen now.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; This seed here.
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; Let us make man in our own image.
[2:40:33] It was supposed to multiply.
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; And fill the earth. But at the end of it
[2:40:41] all, it was supposed to be gathered back
[2:40:44] together,
[2:40:46] one thing called the bride of witches.
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; So the bride
[2:40:54] while they are called seeds
[2:40:57] in their individual identity,
[2:41:01] they are one seed,
[2:41:03] the bride of Christ.
[2:41:09] This is a little deep.
[2:41:13] You go back to the tape.
[2:41:16] He says, "Then here is this man."
[2:41:19] Now the man sinned
[2:41:22] and when he sinned and fell,
[2:41:26] then that little cloud there
[2:41:30] become mad and blood.
[2:41:34] Then the logos came down
[2:41:37] and made flesh
[2:41:40] and wrote among us to redeem this man
[2:41:43] back
[2:41:45] to the love of the father. And he came
[2:41:48] in by the Holy Spirit
[2:41:52] and chest sin out of the human
[2:41:59] and brings man back again
[2:42:03] in fellowship with God. So right now God
[2:42:08] deals with the inner man
[2:42:11] to resurrelect him by a union.
[2:42:16] Are you together with me? Until he comes
[2:42:19] on the side,
[2:42:21] there cannot be a reunion.
[2:42:26] So he says, I'm going down
[2:42:29] to unite myself
[2:42:31] with my bride. And this union is an
[2:42:36] invisible union
[2:42:38] to the single individual
[2:42:40] and to the entire body.
[2:42:43] We are united
[2:42:46] to produce the fruit.
[2:42:49] Amen. The fruit of the spirit
[2:42:52] an invisible union.
[2:42:56] Amen. Then invisible union as I'm
[2:42:59] winding up.
[2:43:01] Amen. He says that you are separated
[2:43:04] from your first union
[2:43:08] by spiritual death. Now you are born
[2:43:11] again.
[2:43:12] Or you are married again to the new
[2:43:15] spiritual union
[2:43:17] of not your natural life
[2:43:20] of the things of the world but of the
[2:43:23] eternal life
[2:43:27] that was in you at the beginning found
[2:43:30] you.
[2:43:32] Hallelujah. Then again he says that's my
[2:43:36] message to you.
[2:43:38] That's a union.
[2:43:41] Union
[2:43:44] that you are dead to the old husbands,
[2:43:47] you are born a new
[2:43:49] try to dig them up.
[2:43:52] If you are born again
[2:43:55] Christian,
[2:43:57] that little gem that was predestinated
[2:44:00] to you,
[2:44:02] it's word coming on word
[2:44:05] on word on word on word
[2:44:08] and come in full stature
[2:44:10] Jesus Christ. That's right. So he can
[2:44:14] get his bride.
[2:44:16] Are you together with me? Oh, praise
[2:44:19] God. The word comes down, the Holy
[2:44:23] Spirit comes down, baptize you into the
[2:44:27] bas of the Holy Spirit. Not this one
[2:44:30] here, but the seed Jes. And when he gets
[2:44:34] in there, he's more like a B of a shirt.
[2:44:39] But as you feed on the word, he keeps
[2:44:42] growing and growing to crowd out all the
[2:44:46] darkness.
[2:44:48] And when you are light,
[2:44:53] then are you ready for the rapture?
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:44:59] Why? Because now you are light. You are
[2:45:03] light of his light.
[2:45:07] You are what?
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; Of his word.
[2:45:10] Now that means the bride
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; which is the seed
[2:45:18] has made herself ready.
[2:45:22] And what God will do is to come and
[2:45:26] change this thing
[2:45:29] so that it can come into the same form
[2:45:32] with inside life.
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; Are you born again?
[2:45:40] Children of God,
[2:45:42] you got the invisible union.
[2:45:46] That's why you're here.
[2:45:48] That's why you leave all those things.
[2:45:52] There is a power
[2:45:54] that is controlling you from the inside,
[2:45:59] controlling you purely. Amen. That's why
[2:46:04] you are becoming better
[2:46:07] every day. That's why when you make a
[2:46:10] mistake, you run back to the blood.
[2:46:13] There is a command from the center.
[2:46:17] Amen. There is a union.
[2:46:20] The person of the Holy Spirit has come
[2:46:23] into your life. Don't baptize this, but
[2:46:28] awaken the things.
[2:46:30] water it, bring it to life, into union,
[2:46:35] and be able to bring forth fruit. God
[2:46:38] bless you. Amen. Amen.
[2:46:43] The mind
[2:46:45] behind
[2:46:47] the invisible union,
[2:46:50] we can stand up. Do you love him?
[2:46:53] &gt;&gt; Do you love the word? Amen. Amen. The
[2:46:57] invisible union
[2:46:59] is not about marriage and divorce,
[2:47:04] but it's God
[2:47:06] coming into your life in a secret way
[2:47:10] of the third pool to a wakened word
[2:47:15] which is on the side of you. And then
[2:47:17] that word seed gin once it's woken up
[2:47:23] then the life of God begins to form on
[2:47:26] the inside
[2:47:28] and then grow to the out.
[2:47:31] Where does the life begin from
[2:47:34] the holy of holies?
[2:47:37] Are you together with me? It begins from
[2:47:40] the inside.
[2:47:42] Then it pours out on the earth.
[2:47:44] So, I'm looking forward
[2:47:47] to looking at some of the children to
[2:47:49] see some of the children of God
[2:47:52] that are going to start pouring out that
[2:47:55] life
[2:47:57] in their life, in their work, in their
[2:48:01] places of work, in the way they dress,
[2:48:05] in the way they live, and life will
[2:48:07] start pouring out.
[2:48:10] Why? Because there has been an invisible
[2:48:14] union
[2:48:16] and that pouring out
[2:48:19] is the fruit of your union.
[2:48:22] God bless you. God bless you. Do you
[2:48:26] love him? Amen. Thank God for that
