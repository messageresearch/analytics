to say God bless you so much amen uh let's get our Bibles and we start the service with B with the scripture reading you'll turn with me to the Book of John 16 ver3 amen the scripture says how when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show he will show you things to come amen and for our text tonight I'll be talking on the Holy Spirit our inside teacher so may the Lord bless his word we may get seated amen amen so I want to take to pick it up from the Old Testament once again in chapter 41 of Genesis amen the scripture we read in John 16 said that when the Holy Spirit when he come he will guide us through all truth amen so now here in the Book of Genesis chter 41 here is the scripture talking about pharaoh and the dream that he had dreamed amen and the scripture says in verse one and it came to pass at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river and behold there came up out of the river seven well favored kind and flat fleshed and they fed in in [Music] a and behold seven other can came up after them out of the river ill favored and L fleshed and stood by the other can upon the brink of the river and Ill favored and lean fleshed kind did eat up the flesh well favored and F kind so Pharaoh awoke and he slept again and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon One stock Rank and [Music] good and behold seven thin ear and blasted with the East Wind sprung up after them and the Seven thin ears divide the seven Rank and full ears and Pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream and it came to pass in the morning that his Spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magans of Egypt and all the wise men thereof and Pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh then spoke the chief Butler unto Pharaoh saying I do remember my faults this day Pharaoh was rough with his servants and put me in what in the captain of the God's house both me and the chief beaker and we dreamed a dream in one night I and he we dreamed each one each men according to the interpretation of his dream and there was with us a young man an Hebrew servant the captain of the god and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret so now this was Joseph the Hebrew boy young man they were talking about so now here is Pharaoh he has a dream and the first Dream is confusing the Bible says again he slept and again he dream a dream and the second dream was much like the first Dream he called the magans and the wise men of the land he tried praise the Lord but he could not interpret the dream and Pharaoh became so furious with here is a man who remembered something that had happened the chief Butler he said I remember my faults this day then he began telling Pharaoh how he and his friend were in prison and how they had a dream each of them and how they spoke that dream to a young Hebrew Joseph interpreted dream and how they came to pass exactly the way they had dreamed praise the Lord And now when Pharaoh calls him he's able to tell Pharaoh the dream and the interpretation thereof when he had a dream he said praise the Lord I want us to get there and see how what what he answered he said Joseph answered pharaoh saying in verse 16 it is not in Me God shall give Pharaoh an answer of Praise the Lord so he recognized praise the Lord that it was not him that had ability to interpret the dream he recognized that it was God that had the power to go in the mind of a person to go ahead of time prise the Lord because the dream that Pharaoh had it was a future phenomenon it was something that was going to happen in the future it's only God it's only the holy spirit that has the ability to go ahead of time and bring things into existence and bring the things of the future and make them known unto us today praise the Lord so he said it is not in me but it is God and the God that I serve shall give Pharaoh an answer of this so he went ahead to tell him the interpretation he told him of the seven years plenty and the seven years ofine are going to hit the land and when Pharaoh heard it was so much amazed praise the Lord so we do two we see two things here that there was going to be a fine in the future praise the Lord around maybe 14 years ahead and then was going be of food and now there were a people of God that God must preserve praise the Lord and now there was also a Joseph who was in prison in a Strange Land and he was serving a sentence a he had not committed and now God gives a dream first of all the chief battler and Joseph interprets the dream and the CH leaves prison and Joseph remains in there then after some time when even this man had forgotten about Joseph after Pharaoh had pressed each of them now God reminds him that there was a man who did favor for you when you got this dream he interpreted and it got you out of prison when he remembered he told Pharaoh there is a man who I know can give this interpretation praise the Lord why because when he was with Joseph he saw the spirit that was in Joseph he saw that the spirit was very strange there was something special about Joseph that was not common with the rest of the people praise the Lord that Joseph was able to listen to The Dream he had the spirit which is the holy spirit which is God himself who was in position to look at the dream even if the dream was to happen 100 years ahead the spirit of God would get the event in 100 years time to and bring them now and be able to give the interpretation there of praise the Lord but we see that in all that Joseph never exalted himself he remained humble and recognized that it was not Joseph that was giving the interpretation of the dreams the God that was with him was the one that was able to interpret the dreams raise the name of the Living God so what do we notice here we see that Joseph as a humble servant of God Joseph as a man that was bearing the spirit of God was able to recognize the hand and the spirit of God that was with him but even when he noticed that he had something special he never exalted himself he still remained humble and he waited upon the Lord until when God could possibly bring it to happen that he get rescued from the prison praise the Lord and now if God was in position praise the Lord after he had given this dream to Pharaoh if God wanted to show Joseph the God would have given Joseph the dream interpretation but God got this dream gave it to Pharaoh praise the Lord such that Joseph praise the Lord it was time for Joseph to be recognized in the day that was living because if God had given Joseph the dream maybe Pharaoh would not would not appreciate it he would not accept it but if Pharaoh had a dream it is Joseph to come and give the interpretation the Bible tells us that God shall do nothing praise the Lord but he speaks he speaks all these Mysteries he all these Mysteries and he gives them unto his servants the prophet and now we appreciate that Joseph was a prophet because from the time when he was young he had these dreams he could for these things that's why he was hated of his brother praise the Lord but now when this time came God had to bring a future event bring it near and give it to Pharaoh in order for Joseph rescued out of prison it was not only to bring him out of prison but it was to elevate him to a position recognized in the rest of the land praise the name of the Living God so the Prophet Joseph confessed and said is not I but God shall give Pharaoh an answer of Peace God was God was was in Joseph and the spirit of God was upon him to give him direction to show him things that we are coming to pass to show him things that in the future to manifest the future events and show him what was coming along the way so the Holy Spirit goes ahead of time looks at the events that would be brings them closer to us with the eye of Prophecy and so Joseph confessed that it was not me but the spirit that is that is upon me and the god in me shall give the interpretation of the dream shall bring the secret in the dream to manifestation God has always done the same things prise the Lord we know that God has always chosen a special message in in in every age God chose Joseph in that day Joseph would be a savior for his people still Joseph be a light a star be a beacon of light of the light of God in the land of Egypt praise the Lord that when everybody heard what Joseph spoke about the dream they were all waiting for the manifestation of the dream but now we see something strange here that Pharaoh did not wait for the dream to come to pass when he had he looked at the knowledge and the wisdom with which Joseph gave the interpretation and recognized that Joseph was not alone but Joseph had the hand of God that testimony was enough to convince Pharaoh that the interpret that Joseph was giving was ordered of the Lord he believed him and he elevated him and he gave him Authority and he gave him Powers praise the Lord the testimony that people were carrying about Joseph about the mixed Spirit the special street that he was carrying was just enough to give a special testimony to pharaoh and the rest of the house this word that Joseph was car was the truth praise the Lord and now we also recognize that this same God who worked through Joseph he worked through so many prophets in the land he has visited so many prophets and could tell he could tell them things that we are going to happen in the future and could bring them closer and could make them known to the people the Lord and whatever he gave came perfectly exactly the way he mentioned we know that there was also a dream that Nebuchadnezzar had and still God elevated still elevated Daniel to come up praise the Lord the spirit of God was upon Daniel the spirit of God was in Daniel So Daniel got the dream and interpretation gave it unto him King Nebuchadnezzar was something that was going to happen in the future but God brought it down through the vision through the dream and he gave it unto Daniel and when Daniel spoke it believed that whatever Daniel spoke was the truth praise the Lord why when he looked atel and the wisdom with which Daniel spoke and their humility you recognize that there was a special Spirit upon Daniel praise the Lord what was that it was God working through his people try to give a direction of the that we are going to come to pass it was God in Daniel it was God in Joseph trying to show the Kings the things that we are going to come to pass many years ahead but he is a God praise the Lord the god that lives in us that lives in us he such a special God that he reveals these secrets prise the Lord the prophets and when the prophets when they come to speak to us praise the Lord they prophesy and whatever they speak comes to pass exactly as they have mentioned we have the prophet of our day very many years ago God gave him seven Visions he gave him visions of the things that we are coming to pass praise the Lord the spirit of God that was upon William Bram had the ability to go many years ahead and see the things that we are going to happen the things that you going to be the world then you could bring them down and showed them to the prophet praise the Lord and he would tell him these are the things that are going to come to pass and the prophet after he was convinced why because in in a dream the prophet would go ahead of time he could see things happening he see exactly things manifesting and so he was convinced by what he saw that he would come to pass that's when he could come tell the people I saw this it is says the Lord shall come to pass exactly the way he saw it in 1933 he gave him seven Visions praise the Lord and all the seven Visions prise the Lord we saw we saw one at at a go one at a time coming to happen exactly the way God has showed you the first Vision praise the Lord was M was a division about mine and his invasion of ethopia and in a message once more he says the Holy Spirit came one morning and told me seven things that would take place before this nation was destroyed one of them is that it's on it's on Old Paper there at the church and many has looked at it five of those things has perfectly been fulfilled exactly now would rise and go to ethopia fall at his steps and would be turned to the people in shame with a woman and many many years before it happened perfectly it's never failed and it would fail because it is th says the Lord and it is not contr to this Bible and another message church he says First Vision was that musin would invade Ethiopia and that and that Nation would fall at his steps that Vision surely did cause more repercussions and some were very angry when I said it would it would and would not believe it but it happened that way he just walked in there he just walked in there with his mod arms and took over the natives didn't have a chance but the vision also say that M would come to a horrible end with his own people standing on him that came to pass just exactly as it was saying now God had gone ahead of time and go the spirit of this messenger or the spirit of his servant and he carried it over ahead of time and he showed him how things were going to happen how would invade eia and how would come to end and it happened exactly the way he spoke and these are some of the facts about his happening there's a newspaper that writes and says praise the Lord ethopia ethopia which Italy had unsuccessfully tried to conquer in the 1890s was in 1934 one of the few independent states in European dominant Africa in the European dominated inant a b inant between Ethiopia and an Italian somal land that December gave Benito Molin an excuse to intervene there was a conflict between ethopia and Italian somand and the Italian somal land no no no no and and and somal and the Somali land Som ethopia and somal ethopia Somalia praise the Lord decle says it gave Benito an excuse to intervene rejecting allra offers Italians invaded on October 3rd 1935 under generals rodol once and Petro the invading forces steadily pushed back thearmed and poorly trained ethopian Army stead pushed back the ill ared and poor train ethopian Army winning a major victory near aangi on April 9th 1936 yes on April 9th 1936 taking the and on May the nation's leader Emperor went into Exile in Rome proclaimed Italy's King Victor Emmanuel emperor of ethopia so now we see that 1935 and 1936 35 and 36 around four years after the vision God had given the prophet invaded eia praise the Lord so now we see that the spirit of God went ahead of time you were to give leadership it was giving guidance praise the Lord guidance to the messenger of the day so now when he heard it and when he saw it he spoke it and three four years after became past exactly the way he said what was that it was God it was the Holy Spirit trying to give guidance praise the Lord trying to guide the scripture has said that when the Holy Spirit the spirit of truth comes upon us he shall guide us through all truth he shall be the teacher he shall point us to the way so now here 1933 that same Holy Spirit was giving guid us to the prophet of our day and he was showing him things that we going to come and they came to pass exactly the way he say praise the Living God there are so many articles that WR about this Invasion and their writing is very independent of what the prophet spoke in fact many of them may not even have known that there was a prophet who spoke about it but they wrote about the invasion of ethopia but we know that the prophet had spoken about it around 3 to four years ago praise the lord and there is another Vision about the rise of Hitler the prophet got this vision3 and he spoke about the rise of Hitler praise the Lord and how the dictator would take over German he would dra the world into war and it says it showed it showed the The Siege freight line and how our troops would have a terrible time to overcome it then it showed that Hitler would come to a mysterious end praise the Lord and still a few years after the way the prophet spoke about it it came to pass and it was an article that was published in the Holocaust encyclopedia how Hitler came to power and they narrated how the N party elector electoral succession made it difficult to govern German and how Hitler and Nazis refus to work with other political parties and how Hitler demanded to be appointed Chancellor how he he demanded to be appointed the German president PA V ini resisted this demand however he gave in and appointed Hitler as a chancellor of German on jary 30th and appointed Hitler to this position as the result of a political deal and later did not immediately become a dictator when he had become and the article says Germany's Democratic constition was still in effect however Hitler manipulated democ the Democratic political system and in August 1934 the president died and Hitler was he proclaimed himself leader of German and from that point forward he became a dictator of German but in 1945 he came to a horrible end and the article says until today there are sever conspir theories about his death others say he was exhumed to prevent from recognizing him he was exhumed put in or something like but witnesses that include his bodyguard pilot and [Applause] Commander he said in the in the back he said that he died in the backyard or the leaders Garden anded there with a bomb that may have consumed him and as of today there isn't a clear report about Hitler's death confirming the prophecy given in 1933 come horrible end God had given this Vision to [Applause] will later R around 12 years after had raised to power and he came to a mysterious end the way the prophet saw it in a vision and the third Vision speaks about the three he speaks about coming into play fism Nazism naism and communism communism praise the Lord and many years after each of these systems was coming to play it started with fism which describes capitalism capitalism the rise and dominance of Italy in World Systems which is of course the Roman religious movement active dominance of all systems which later led to the evolvement of Nazism and Nazism describes the great powers of Germany which later collapsed mysteriously at the hands of the Communist Russia and now when nazm Andis joined all lost to Russia's communism when Russia captured and put ADF Hitler's route an end and these things had been prophesied in 1933 in a vision and later they came to pass exactly the prophet spoke about we saw the rise of the of we saw the rise of of Roman religious movement we saw the rise of Nazism in Germany praise the Lord when ad Hitler took over then we saw that these all lost to Russia the communism system when it came and took over and the prophet had mentioned about them in a vision God confirming his word praise the Lord that is there ever present with his Messengers ever present with his servants as the Holy Spirit who give them the direction praise the Lord he gives him the vision gives them inspiration and inspiration that he gives unto them comes to pass exactly the way they have spoken it because they are not speaking words of themselves they are speaking as thus says the Lord praise the Lord God comes down inside of them praise the Lord in form of the Holy Spirit and he Vis them and he takes them a little bit ahead of time he show them things he reveals things unto them praise the Lord and then when they listen to him they are convinced that it is God when they come down to bring the vision that they have received of God before the people to guide the people through the times and Seasons the holy spirit being our inside teacher guiding us through all truth praise the Lord and here comes another Vision fourth Vision speaking about the technology advancement with evolvement of a d car 1939 a company published their first driverless car praise the Lord and Vision that Prophet had seen came to pass six years later he saw another Vision about Mor Decay and it was so much lik to a woman it was speaking about moral Decay speaking about women and he says the vision had to do with moral problem of our ageing mostly around women God showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote with the granting of the vote and we see the Clause of the 19th century we start witnessing movements advocating for women emancipation advocating for women uh equality gender equality trying to get women from their position blessing them at the same level as men God show the prophet and it came to pass exactly that even today we see so many women into active politics women leaving their position coming to take over positions that that belong to men and in the in the sixth division he saw the rise of a woman praise the Lord a woman in America a most beautiful but cruel woman and he says she held the people in her complete power I believe that was that this was the rise of the of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman raising in great in America to popular vote praise the Lord and now around 45 years 47 years we see a woman rising up in America like he said he Reon it maybe to a Roman Catholic church but maybe it could be a woman raising up in America with great power praise the Lord and in 2001 in 2001 we saw the rise of harala as one of the most powerful woman in America holding the one of the most powerful positions as the Vice President of America and we see today she's now advocating for the most powerful position in the whole world [Music] she's buying to be a president of the United States of America uned States of America and the prophet saw vision and around 45 years ahead of time the vision is coming to pass exactly the way he saw it what was that the Holy Spirit praise the Lord it has been good from the beginning and now God that was with with Joseph to see the visions see the dreams and see the interpretations and making things happen exactly the way he saw them the same God that was with Daniel the same God that was with job Jeremiah and the of the prophets it's the same God that was with William Bram trying to show him things that would come to pass the holy spirit being the leader being the teacher being the guide the messenger of our day and as we shall see is the same spirit that is in the church today this is the same spirit that is in you and me today trying to teach us through all truth guide us towards the word praise the Lord and the last Vision he saw the explosion in America he saw explosion of America the most terrible explosion and it says I turn look I saw nothing but de de CR and smoke all over the land of America praise the Lord and the New York Times the New York Times paper York on October 2nd 2023 [Music] october3 they wrote and said Russia may be planning to test to test a nuclear powered missile Visual Evidence from a remote base in the Artic shows launch operations and you have seen articles when Russia is warning America that America would be soled up in a hint of one nuclear bomb America and that is the last Vision we looking out to see the rest of them have happened and we are convinced that if the rest of the Visions have come to pass this Vision shall come to pass one of days why he is the same God has made all of things possible and now in jph God was down in jph showing him things that we are going to come to pass the in Joseph was trying to guide the people trying to guide the king and Pharaoh listened and we have the Holy Spirit today as our inside teacher don't have to fall asleep before before he tells us what to do did like Pharaoh did did for us to be able to know what to do where to go and how to walk and all that he is very present with us to guide us through all truth to teach us the right path to show us things present to show us things to come praise the Lord he is still present with us is that still Small Voice that speak to us every day of Our Lives he is that same spirit that speaks to us through the scriptures the Lord to guide us on how we should do it praise the Lord to guide us on how we should walk to guide us on how we should relate with others to guide us on how we should worship the holy spirit is with us today why praise the Lord in the Old Testament he used to Vis individuals now when Jesus comes the day of Pentecost praise the Lord he said when the spirit is come he shall get you through all truth and the day of Pentecost the Lord we see the Holy Spirit coming down prise the Lord and he fell upon each one of them and he did come once but he came praise the Lord to be upon us to be upon us because the Bible says this promise is for you and to as many as the Lord shall call praise the Lord whosoever shall come thereafter it was a promise that would be given the Holy Spirit praise the Lord and now that we have this Holy Spirit we have believe the word of God accepted last Sunday last last Wednesdays we've been teaching about the three courts praise the Lord that when we open our hearts praise the after we have believed we allow God to come in our hearts we allow him to come and work in our hearts and cleans us and sanctify us and then he extends deeper into the soul and when he makes AB he is here to stay prise the

to be teaching the church nothing but the truth the holy spirit being our inside teacher praise the Lord he is our comforter he speaks to us through the words about the times and the seasons he tells us through the scriptures which we are living and we can surely say that we are living the day of becoming of the Lord our Compass teaching us the truth and bringing the things manifestation showing

has showed it how shall they preach except they have heard the preacher that preaches the gospel of peace the gospel of salvation must first be sent of God they are messengers carriers and must not possess anything on their own they don't car their own mind to the people they are carriers of a message they have seen and heard from God and the Holy Spirit is there to guide them to the innermost chamber to the innermost Court the chambers of God to first see and witness and get convinced that what they have seen and heard is the truth and then they come to pass it on the message that they

pastors praise the Lord that there are men who wait upon the Lord praise the Lord who get to the inner Chambers who open up themselves and wait upon the Lord to receive the mind of God before they come and take it upon the people so doing they are not paying fors glories but they laboring and striking so hard point the people to Jesus Christ when the Holy Spirit comes he shall do nothing but he shall point you towards the and when a man has been sent of God he shall preach nothing but the word of God shall point the people to nothing else but the truth praise the Lord the Bible has said that
