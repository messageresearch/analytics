let the spirit of of the Lord Cal down amen I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ let us ourselves and pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for this evening the grace that you've given unto us to come into your presence Lord you said where two or three are gathered in your name you will be there in their midst and Lord we believe you are here Lord we praise that you may bless every one of us and you may speak to us in such special alone and they are all the prayers of your children PR upon this service in the name of the Lord Jesus amen let us go to the Book of Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 we're reading from verse 26 to verse 27 so the Bible says likewise the spirit also helps our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself makes intercession for us with groaning which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because he makes intercession for the Saints according to the will of God may we just want to continue with the subject we had last Wednesday but this time we want to call it the intercession of the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord the holy spirit intercedes for us praise the name of our Lord last wedes were talking about the comforter has come praise the name of the Lord and the comforter we saw is actually the spirit of the truth which is the Holy Spirit and then the word Comfort also means anate the one who stands on your side the one who pleads for you praise the name of our Lord and so we want to see that the holy spirit intercedes for us praise the name of our Lord and you know the Holy Spirit takes our place praise the name of our Lord the Bible has told us that the holy spirit makes intercession for us with the groanings which can not be uttered praise the name of the Lord and then he says he intercedes for us according to our weaknesses our infirmities our failures praise the name of the Lord so that the Holy Spirit comes and works in our lives and then he identifies the different weaknesses that we have and then intercedes praise the name of the Lord and then we see that the intercession work is continuous until you know the rupture takes place praise the name of our Lord until Christ takes the whole possession when Christ claims all that he has redeemed praise the name of our Lord but right now is interceding for us and you know brother Bram says that the prayers praise the name of Lord of the Saints you know they have to pass through Christ or it's by the blood of Jesus Christ that you know we have all these intercessions praise the name of our Lord for us praise the name of our Lord Blood on the altar you know helping us in our infirmities praise the name of our Lord so brother Bram says in the 50th seal he says notice this now now if there is no altar of sacrifice in heaven where is the sacri sacrifice for sin laying then L there has to be a place where the slain lamb blood is laying there where the blood now the incense was the ous stuff that they B which the Bible said was the prayers of the Saints if there isn't No sacrifice on the altar then the prayers cannot be received it's only by the blood on the sacrificial altar that lets the prayers go through to God praise the name of the Lord we see we have a privilege what the Bible says that we have boldness now that we can go to the holies of holies by the blood of Jesus Christ so we have access the door has not been closed praise the name of our Lord and you see that the Gospel of Jesus Christ it was it has always been an Open Door praise the name of our Lord it has always been an open door it's the person themselves who says I'm not worthy that's what the scripture says that those who were bidden to [Music] come and they did not come they were unworthy they consider themselves not worthy the way Paul Wasing to the Jews we've been sent to preach to you the gospel in the book of Acts 13 in verse 46 then Paul and Barabas worked B and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life LA turn to the Gentiles praise the name of the Lord he says we pre come to preach to you declare you that the door is open deare to you that there is forgiveness of sin that the sacrifice still on the altar but now you have rejected it then you count yourselves unworthy praise the name of our Lord so we should count ourselves that we are worthy because Christ has given us the gospel praise the name of our Lord that's what makes us worthy because he says come unto me you are Heaven I will give you rest praise the name of our Lord so you don't cut off yourself that's why the Bible is telling us we have a high priest praise the name of our Lord who maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God praise the name of the Lord in Hebrews 7 verse 24 says but this man because he continues ever has unchangeable priesthood 24 wherefore he is able also to serve them to the atmost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them [Music] praise the name of our Lord the Bible says he ever liveth and why is he ever living to to to intercede for us and then the Bible says he wants to save us the most in other words our complete [Music] Redemption until nobody of us can sin anymore until we have no more weaknesses so now in the time when we have weaknesses he says I'm interceding for you praise the name of our Lord that's the confidence that we should have that once accepted the Lord Jesus as my personal Savior and then his Spirit lives within me then the holy spirit is in our life to help us in our weaknesses to help us overcome our failures that's why is a high priest up this is where I'm having failures and then you believe in him to help you in your weaknesses praise the name of our Lord in the message proving his word the Bible said the Bible Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he says he a high priest sitting there making intercessions Upon Our confession we have to confess it first before he can be a high priest praise the name of Lord says we have to confess it what you want him to intercede for you you know just like when you have an advocate you tell the advocate all your issues and then the ADV T your issues before the judge so now we tell God we tell God all our weaknesses and then Christ intercedes on our behalf and he says intered on our confessions we have to confess it first before he can be a high priest because he only intered to our confession is that right he only inters Upon Our confession what we confess that he is what what he has done for us not what he will do he has already done it we have to confess that he's done it he's wounded for our transgressions withes were healed praise the name of so we confess to Christ and then when we confess to Christ then he intercedes based on our confession amen aen then in the message why brother Bram says that's the same thing with Divine Healing you don't I see people all worked up and try to get nervous and saying or if I could know you got over the top of it you leave it behind you you are going out there excited and trying to reach for something right there by you just simple just say thank you Father you promised it to me I now receive it for my healing what is he Christ is the high priest of our confession he the high priest of our confession then he can do one thing for you can make no intercession until you first conf that it's done is that scripture high priest of our confession then he can only act when we confess praise the name of our Lord and then he continues to say now if you say Lord I lost the joy of my salvation I want you I stayed away from prayer meeting wednes night will find me right back or Tuesday whatever it is I'll be right back all right mean that believe it say I have confessed I'm wrong now start working on it start Christ starts interceding for you I'm sorry that I sinned Lord I'm going to be a Christian from now on then see you made your confession start right on it if you are sick say Lord you are my healer if I sin to cause this to come upon me forgive me Lord I'm taking you at your word you said you would heal me I believe it you are the high priest of My Confession now I'm confessing that by your stripes I was healed you are the high priest of My Confession now I'm confess your stripes I was healed thank you Lord go right on see then he can go to work on know that God is and God is a rewarder those that diligently seek him praise the name of our Lord so you must have confidence that when you confess because you are confessing based on the Promises of God so you take the claims and then brother Bram says the Holy Spirit enforces those promises make sure that they come to pass praise the name of our Lord so we have the high priest who is touched by the feeling of our infirmities praise the name of our Lord in Romans 8:3 the Bible says who shall lay anything to the charge of God is elect it is God that justifi who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yeah rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake are we killed all day long we are counted as sheep for Slaughter now in all these things we are more than us through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord [Music] amen praise the name of our Lord he says nothing shall separate us from the word love of God he says we are more than conquerors through our Lord Jesus Christ so then we have to yield all our lives to the Lord Jesus Christ you surrender all your life unto him and allow him to take over all your life to take over all your desires to take over all your mind praise the name of our Lord the Lord can take over and then in your weaknesses the Bible says the holy spirit makes intercession for us so in the mid of all our challenges we have a high priest praise the name of our Lord who is Ever standing there to help us praise the name of our Lord every rest that we have so then you allow him to take over your condition praise the name of our in Hebrews chter 4 and then in verse 14 the Bible says seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold our profession the Bible says let us hold first our profession what is your confession what would you want the Lord to do for you because each of us has different station so you tell the Lord this is my need this is my weak like our Lord Jesus Christ wherever he went you would ask them what would you want me to do for you the Le I want to be clean and he would make them clean I want to walk and make them walk every person had their own weaknesses and based on their confession and desire for help Christ would help them according to their need Christ is the same yesterday today and forever even us to help us on our needs to help us in our weaknesses praise the name of our Lord so he ever leaveth to make intercession for us now in verse 15 the Bible says for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like we are yet without sin praise the name of our Lord says he a high priest who is touched you know he has compassion he sympathizes with us he is concerned about our Affairs so then you tell him your condition Lord this is my weakness and the infirmities here the Bible is talking about says he touched with the feeling of our infirmities weaknesses and spiritual weaknesses praise the name of so he is touched by all our weaknesses our weaknesses in these bodies Our weaknesses in the soul so then you confess it to him Lord this is where the devil is taking a hold of my life and God wants to know that you are also concerned about your weakness so then you confess it to him and then the Bible says he is touched praise the name of the Lord and then he confesses it praise the name of our Lord the high priest of our confession so inters for US based on our confession praise the name of our so then he says let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace in the time of need praise the name of our Lord he says come boldly don't come with fear come depending on Christ not depending upon yourself one thing we need to know is what does the Lord want me to do in this kind of situation and then you come by the word of God the Lord wants you to address that kind of condition in your life Lord this is my weakness this is my failure I depending upon you to help me out of this condition depending upon you to deliver me from this kind of situation so you confessing it you are presenting it before the high priest and then brother Bram says believe that the Lord is going to handle that issue praise the name of our Lord like our Salvation you have to believe that you are saved if you don't believe that you are saved then you as well you are out but you have to believe it that I am saved why do I believe that I'm saved because I've done what the word requires me to do praise the name of the Lord so even our healing by his stripes I was healed so you also believe that he has healed you and then you don't allow the negative to come in your mind healed it's not for me to be healed praise the name of our Lord Brother talks about pardon and then he talks about a man who was taken in prison during the time of Abraham LOL and then when a friend went and talked to the president and then for him then the president wrote on AER and said this one is pardoned and this man ran to the prison told him the president has pardoned you and then he say it is here now what this man was looking for where is the seat of the president where is the where is the stamp of the president he didn't believe the pardon the foll he was executed when it went to court then they said that a pardon is not a pardon until it is accepted the name of our Lord so we also have to believe our pardon we have to believe the Forgiveness of our sins we have to believe the healing of our bodies we have to believe the salvation of our souls whatever he has promised us you say Lord I believe it Lord I receive it and that's how the Holy Ghost can intercede for us because we are believing what the Holy Spirit has told us through the word praise the name of the Lord so then he says come boldly to the throne of grace that you may obtain mercy and Grace to help in the time of need praise the name of our Lord we go to Hebrews 2: 17 the Bible says wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he's able to sucker them that are tempted praise the name of our he says he was also tempted so he's able also to [Music] help is able to suer them in other words to bring assistance you know in our weaknesses when we are tempted then he comes and helps you you see the Bible says that there's no temptation that takes you than what God knows that you are able to withand and then he says in every Temptation he always makes a way of Escape that is how he helps us that's how he comes and assists us he becomes our Advocate praise the name of our Lord he gives us the strength when we are weak praise the name of our Lord so we need to depend upon God praise the name of our Lord to do his work in our lives that he can help us at all the time so you can depend upon him the Bible says is a merciful and faithful high priest he's here to make reconciliation for our sins to bring us back to line to bring us to the image of God praise the name of our Lord so we need to yield to the Holy Spirit and allow the spirit of God to completely take over all our lives praise the name of our Lord in Hebrews chapter 5 verse 1 verse3 the scripture says for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity [Music] praise the name of the Lord it says the priesthood the priesthood of Levi there were men born in sin they weaknesses so the Bible says they have compassion because they also go through the the same challenges praise the name of the Lord they had compassion those who are ignorant they don't know anything left or right like people who have never accepted the Lord Jesus as their personal Savior and they they have compassion upon them so that they can turn out of the evil way that they can walk in the way of Truth and righteousness but then there are also those who know the truth but then they go asay you know they go off the line so they has compassion on those who are ignorant and even those who are out of the way so that they can be br brought back into the F of Christ so now the priesthood is to intercede for the weaknesses of the people to bring reconciliation between man and God the Holy Ghost does this in our lives the name of our Lord bring us that we can be able to stand in the presence of God now in first John chapter 2 and then verse one he says my little children the things right I unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous praise the name of our Lord we have an advocate our Lord Jesus Christ so he says don't s but when somebodys that's not the end of the person says we have an advocate praise the name of the Lord so you don't allow your sttion to hold you back from The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit but then you bring it before God and say Lord this is where my weakness is this is where I'm failing you allow the Holy Spirit take over that weakness praise the name of the Lord you know we had a sister that's after and then she came to study from one of the schools around and then she ended up missing herself in the school not and she stopped coming to church when they asked her said I'm dirty but how long will you be dirty outside there and she didn't come back till she left but here the Bible says we have an advocate you don't allow Satan to hold you back there continuous condemnation there and then you don't come and say Lord have mercy upon so he says if any person sin we have an advocate with the father verse then he says and is the pration for our sins and not only ours only but also for the sins of the whole world praise the name of the Lord so we have an advocate so whatever one go through Christ is ready to forgive us of any failures you just bring it before the Lord praise the name of our Lord whatever weakness is whatever failure is you just bring it before the Lord Lord this is my weakness Lord this is my failure know our Lord Jesus Christ said it is the sick that need the physician and that's why he came praise the name of our Lord and he says he whom the son of man has set free he's free indeed praise the name of our Lord that's why brother bras told us right now the blood is on the Altar for what for our forgiveness for our remission of sins for whatever weaknesses that we have bring it to the Lord and say Lord this is what I'm requesting you to help me today you may have this weakness take it to the Lord tomorrow it may be another thing take it to the Lord and as long as we in this bodies praise the name of our Lord weaknesses will keep on coming one thing is constantly put them in the blood of Jesus why Lord's Prayer that's why our Lord's Prayer it has repentance and forgiveness praise the name of the Lord that is part of a Christian Life praise the name of Lord you know one day brother Bram went to a restaurant and then there was this kind of woman she was dressed F and she was an elderly woman and then she was sitting with around with men and doing Maybe funny things and brother said how can this thing happen in his heart saying how can my children be raised in this kind of then the Lord told him come out and I show you something and then he showed you know brother Bram and brother would make mistakes or do things which are wrong and then he s those things actually you know they were going before God but Christ was there receiving them as a bum and then he said Lord for for continuous interceding for his weaknesses praise the name of our Lord great Preacher Brother Bram talks about he dreamed that he he went to heaven before he reached the gate then they asked him who are you he said I'm so and so a great preacher then they checked but you we're not seeing you he said but I a preacher then they started asking him did you deceive he said no then they were showing him those small small things and he found himself not worthy but Christ came and said all that he has done all that he did I stand for him praise the name of our Lord we have a high priest of our confession we allow him to intercede for us praise the name of our Lord and so we need to see that the blood of Jesus Christ washes away all our unrighteousness apply the blood of Jesus Christ in all your weaknesses all your failures every day that you live live under the blood of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord and we see that the Lord will make us overcome all our weaknesses praise the name of our Lord and so when brother Bram was in that vision and then he was God showed him the blood of Jesus Christ covering the sins of the world and says for you you are forgiven but don't want this woman to be forgiven praise the name of our so we need to see that we allow the blood of Jesus Christ to work in us if we are forgiven we also need to have compassion for one another praise the name of our Lord praying for one another interceding for one another asking God have Mery upon my brother God have Mery upon my sister praise the name of our Lord L Abraham had to intered for Lord intered for Sodom Andor praise the name of our that's the same thing as children of God praying for one another interceding for one another if you hear a brother is in this kind of weakness pray for them you don't start moving around telling everybody you know that brother did this and this this and this but pray for that brother a sister is in a bad condition not to start trumpeting we have hot news now put it in prayers before God said Lord help my sister there a weakness is CAU in there which is unpleasant is C in and then you bring it to the Lord in prayer praise the name of our the Bible says we go and help those who are kind of bound in the spirit of meekness praise the name of our Lord help other brothers to lift others who are low lifting them up prise the Lord so when you pray to God don't only pray for yourself but also pray for others and them to God In Prayer praise the name of our Lord may God bless you amen we can stand up and then sing a song and each of us can take time and
