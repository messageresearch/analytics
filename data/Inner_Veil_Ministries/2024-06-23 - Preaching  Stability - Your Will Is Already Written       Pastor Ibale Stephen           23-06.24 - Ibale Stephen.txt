follower I would be for by his hand me he faithful follower I would be Oh by he is [Music] and me [Music] [Applause] amen so we are ready to go now let us stand up we shall turn to the Book of Jeremiah chapter 32 amen let's ser pray father we thank you for your presence Among Us father it's such a great opportunity to see that we can walk through under the blood and come to your presence that we may find Mercy in the time of need and this time father we just pray that you may step out as a teacher speak to our hearts and whatsoever seed you give I pray that you may store it into our souls and then water it with the Waters of the Holy Ghost for it to bring life we commit the entire service and the needs of the people into your hands that never fail in Jesus name amen so here we are in Jeremiah chapter 32 when Jeremiah was in prison for the prophecy uh concerning Israel going to Babylon for 70 years the word of the Lord came to him in prison say your cousin amen will come demanding that you buy his field he did not come to Hanah the prophet that was opposed to Jeremiah but Jeremiah and that prophecy there has to declare that there will be a return amen if you are a seed there will always be a return when the enemy touches his that hand upon him and you know hania was so strong among the people that he was even stronger than the right Prophet sometimes your position is stronger than your authentic voice but when we remember the principle Fe not little FL we shall always hold on the center amen so we shall pick up from verse 9 and I bought the field of Hanam my uncle's son that was in another thought and weighed him the money and 17 shakles of silver and I subscribed the [Music] evidence and sealed it and took witness and weighed him the money in the balances may the Lord had blessing the reading of his word amen the scripture you may be seated the SC says I subscribed the evidence and sealed it amen you know to seal it was to hide it away from public scrutiny it can only be seen at a time when it should be authenticated with the original copy amen so the sealed copy contains the same details of the cell as the same I mean as the open copy did amen let's take a Bible which has got a seal like this like a man so you write and you seal you understand what I mean just an example and then again the same material is in an open copy that is not sealed are you together with me so then we come and read the details about the ownership now if there is an argument we shall go to the sealed copy when it's revealed it must agree with what is written in the book are you together with me the book was sealed on the back side amen but when it was revealed it had to agree with what was in the book amen so I took evidence of the PES verse 11 both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open I gave the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of nah the son of Messiah the in the sight of Han my uncle son in the presence of the witnesses subscribe to the book of the purch before all the Jews that s in the court of the prison and I charged bar before them th say the Lord of host the god of Israel take this evidences this evidence of the purchese both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in vessel that they may continue many days amen for thus says the Lord of host the god of Israel houses and field houses and field and Vineyards shall be possessed again in this land amen so they were going soon in captivity but you see for Jeremiah to redeem his brother's property was a sign was a sign that they will come back into the land again there'll be possession they'll be buying they'll be selling amen and at that time everybody returns to his own inheritance praise the Lord so Hebrews chapter 10 I want to go there with you and verse seven he says then say I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God the will of God you see because this is Jesus prophetically speaking amen and he says I come in the volume of the book which is written of me when Jesus came everything that he was going to do not my will oh father but your will be done and he's saying here that the will of God was already written of him in the volume of the are you together with me amen so I want for a title this morning your will your will is written your will is written so I want to speak on the will of God to them the word will is very rich I don't know how we can interpret this but like the word will in English in grammar will is an expression of a future tense you will finish the work tomorrow you will go to church tomorrow like my grandchildren when they asking about church they always ask you now it becomes night and morning then we go to church so they count the day the day and the night to be one day that's the accounting of the Lord amen so it's an expression of what will be handled in the future will I will I'll go to church amen so you people in the English language just keep the word will of the future test then we have a will to meet a person making known his desire of how maybe his to be uh administered after his demise he makes a will in this a man desires to die tested you know not in tested but to die tested so it's a will he reflected his will so and so becomes the hair and this is what he's going to do so in this two you know will and will we shall cross the borders at will because in both of them is actually determination of the future amen so I want to say that the will of God is the will for you are you together with me yeah we shall get to a point where you see the grace of God so in the natural life like in my life the testator writes the will amen when he sees the demise in view you know if I'm dying I write a will because I see my demise but in Christ your will was written before the foundation of are you together with me me I will write that my car goes to so and so my land go to so and so my house go to so and so became because I came without anything I worked for that and I see that my end is coming I testate and I write but now the most important thing is that in Christ your will was written before the foundation of okay so Ephesians chapter 1 and verse one I want us to be very very very observant this morning Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God Ephesians 1 to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus he anost by the will of God amen you know God desired that was the testate of God God a will that Paul you are going to become an apostle you see the test read thou Apostle amen inance amen so in verse five of the same chapter here is the general will of God for the body for Paul says Paul an apostle by the will of God so I said the will of God becomes a will for you are you together with me so here we come now that God has already will he's a rich father amen he C on a thousand hills amen and you are born into a wealth and you are born with an estate for you Paul and AP of Jesus Christ oh praise the Lord so in Ephesians he says having predestinated us the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will he predestinated us to the adoption that every one of us will be blessed finally according to the good pleasure of his will his will is your will amen so I'll go to the adoption message here brother Bram says you say oh AB father here we begin to come predestinated us to our inheritance in him which was predestinated to us we inherited it before the foundation of the world oh hallelujah hallelujah you inherit before the foundation of the world for his own purpose to work out his own good will to be a God and the Savior his will is my will his will to me amen amen then again he says here inheritance by predestination Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first amen your inheritance comes first so Jesus came to clear the darkness between you and your inheritance isn't that wonderful every one of you has got an inheritance in the wealth of our father amen so the service today is preaching stability that your will is already written that's the title preaching stability your will is already isn't that wonderful that all of us here we are possesses we got an inheritance the will of God is for us to step into into our inheritance or we can call it in our adoption is predestinated for you but finally you have to be blessed amen so God is Not not a man that tested at death Our God has got his mind made up about you before the foundation of the world so what God does when he saves you is to clear the darkness between you and your inheritance having predestinated us the adoption of children we are born manifested signs you know we are born then manifested Sons then we we occupy our iner let us say something about our inheritance here do you love him this morning nothing will permanently stand between you and your inheritance because your inheritance is your portion of the Holy Ghost which you receive amen you see when the Holy Ghost comes because we are different members of the body we cannot operate the same the hand is different the leg is different but both of them they've got a portion amen from I mean of the are you together with me so when you receive the Holy Ghost there is an inheritance you've received and that inheritance will work in your life according to how God for you amen listen now we shall go to Galatians it has been a very wonderful work for me there amen the book of Galatians is a very wonderful book you see Jesus is so upset between you know to much upset with the Galatians more than he does get upset with the Corinthians are you together with me yeah the Corinthians were but if they knew the grace of God then the grace of God would deliver them and build them into the state of a perfect but the Galatians who had begun in that Grace had come down into the law and Paul was wondering how will the law which has already failed perfect them come on now let's go to Galatians 3:15 Breen I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's Covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disal or there praise the Lord he says listen here we are dealing with the Divine Covenant there's no way it can fail so he telling the Galatians that any kind of Covenant even if it's a natural Covenant once it has been appended no can no man can add to it no man can change it are you together with me so he comes to verse 16 now where the promises made he says not un to seeds of many but as of one unto thy seed which is Christ so theen possess the land is you know a shadow of was receiving the Holy Ghost are you together with me you see the Covenant of Israel entering into the land is a shadow for you receiving the Holy Ghost amen the promise to Israel was a natural but the promise to the Seed of Abraham which is you is the Bas of the Holy Spirit and when this Holy Spirit comes he comes you know designed to own the spirit which comes [Music] brother he comes the work that for in Him Praise the Lord so our brother s here he receives the Holy Ghost but the way he receives the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has been designed in such a way that he can only be able to help Silas to do what God ordained for him so that's an inheritance oh praise the Lord so the law which came 430 years after the promise to Abraham amen could not defy could not deter amen Israel from occupying the promise because the law came at SI after they had even left the land of Egypt and they were headed into the promise when the law came it could not put them back they had to go forward because God had made a covenant he doesn't fail on Covenant Amen to the Jews the promise was the land and they received it even after Mount Si the law could not hinder the gra to possess the land amen and listen now out here in the galatian people they were trying to put them back on the law which law had failed to give Israel the land because if they were going in by the strength of the Lord nobody would make it but they went in by the strength of Grace he tells them you did not POS that land because you were righteous but you were Hard Hearted people amen that's what God told so there is no law which gave them the Land There is no law which can give you the B of the Holy Ghost amen it's a gift of Grace that God has given to us and I was telling you in our galatian series that many people think that Grace is a weakness but Grace is strength the law is weakness because it was handled by man are you together with me it was handled by man which man had to pay amen his own atonment before you could even atone for the people but Grace priest here the Lord Jesus himself amen praise the Lord so the Holy Ghost is a straight promise to the elect amen so Galatians 3:18 it says for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise our inheritance is already written our inheritance was given before the foundation of the world our inheritance was given before the LA [Applause] amen so the L has given as a Prohibition to sin are not a requirement to the B of the Holy Ghost but when you receive the Hool GH you again live Above the Law are you together with me yeah we've got some laws of the land Thou shalt not murder you don't wake up any morning and say heavenly father help me that I may not murder the bre on the inside of you makes you live above that law amen we have got the laws of the land we should not beit our wives it's a law about Family Violence but you don't wake up in the morning Heavenly Father help me today that I may not beat sister there's a problem with you because the grace on the inside of you helps you to live a b the law of the land that's how Grace works in your life Grace is not a weakness gra is God on the inside of you lifting you above the Lord amen amen so there was therefore no law that could bring life we are made righteous by the grace of Calvary it drives us and takes us into our promise are you together with me amen that's why Paul amen comes out here in Ephesians 1 amen and he says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself did you hear that somebody say having made known unto us the mystery of his will the mystery of the will of God the scripture says God makes it known you amen so God has a will for everybody and his desire is that you may know the will of God for your life and I've already told you the will of God is your will amen he makes his desire known to everybody Paul says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God it places him there the will of God placed him there God will always make his will known for his children and this will is God's desire for our lives and that's handed over to us as a valid will amen I want us to go to abah here we go to Genesis 12 do you love him this morning yes sir I love him now the Lord said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy father's house unto a land I'll show thee so now he says I will so he's making his perfect will no opening the path into Abraham's inheritance so in verse two he says I will make of the a great nation making known to Abraham the M of his will for his life and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessed and I will bless them that bless thee and C that CES thee and in this shall all the families of the earth be blessed so and in every will we have the details you don't just say I've given you my land on the hill there must be details of the plot number because you could be in but you are not the only one there there are sever many people you can be a pastor but you are not the only Pastor there are several pastors when God anoints other Pastor is different from another Pastor oh hallelujah hallelujah there is a way God anoints us specifically for a particular purpose God makes you a song leader He blesses you a different way makes another that's God I want us to understand that so he defines he makes you know the world plan known and in this inheritance it is exactly like when you are going to get into it it's living one day at a time so let me say this every one of us is on pass to that inheritance if you were there even then you live in the inheritance one day at a time so it's constant obedience is working in the will of God that is your adoption staying in the presence and subject to the presence are you together with me oh praise the Lord Abraham get up begin the Journey I'm taking you to a land that you've never known before and Adam Rises and Abraham Rises and he walks according to the will of God the will of God works him into his will so before going into detail with Abraham let us Branch a little bit and he go into Moses and then theal son you see the whole thing is that our inheritance our spiritual inheritance is not something we are working for it was given to us before the foundation of the world what God desires of us to exact that will in that inheritance is obedience that's all when you walk in obedience you are working in the will of God and the will of God is a will for you so when you lose the will of God your life you are walking away from your will so every day as we walk in the Lord we are walking in the will of God to fulfill his will for us amen inheritance is a very interesting one but we shall get there look at the book of Exodus 3:7 and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the land of the Egyptians and in to bring them up out of a land a good land and at a land flowing with milk and honey verse now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel come unto me and I have come and I've also seen the oppression where we the Egyptians oppress them and I'll send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my children out of Egypt so Moses was not told all the details amen of the commission but what God required was commission I mean was was submission just subit yourself now my will my desire for you Moses is that you become a delivering Prophet that's the anointing that will be upon you that's your inheritance are you together with me yes so now Moses would begin to walk under that anointing is fulfilling the will of God therefore the will of God is the will of God for him simple we want to get into an inheritance and then we begin to pray Heavenly Father help me Heavenly Father help me he help you but you disobey the will of God is your will is your inheritance just obey God says go left go left go right you go right so Moses took his two and ventured into the desire of God which in turn was his will amen God's tested for him so in the tested what belongs to the testator is now yours amen the testator says I have given you and you own it's yours nobody can challenge the ownership so the testator gives a portion of his wealth to you are you together with me he gives it to you so you are now a [Music] possessor come now therefore and I send you to Pharaoh are you together with me I am come down amen praise the Lord I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians is saying I have come down but now Moses I'm giving a portion of my Ministry is going to be your inheritance come now Moses and I make you a deliverer praise the Lord I am the deliverer but Moses I will to you amen my power I will to you Authority go and bring the people out I Le you the creative Authority amen mes would say let be come God L him a portion of himself hallelujah hallelujah and once you are adopted as a Son of God position in Christ God will portion of his authority of his of his glory to you this is my son in whom I am well pleased here him amen because when he speaks is as God speaking I make you like a God and shall be your hallelujah hallelujah finding a position in Christ is God trusting you and giving you some of his authority to do his [Applause] will praise the Lord ah do you love him Aon amen you know shall be your Prophet so when Moses spoke it was as God has spoken and then Aon ran and said what Moses said God fulfilled we have had a prophet in this AG he has prophesied everything for us to know in this age but Revelation 10:7 he says Thou must prophesy amen who will prophesy again we handle the word of Prophecy and we prophesy again that's finding your position in the body and does not mean that you are not going to have challenges they may be so many but God will always stand on your side Moses had the challenges but once you are positioned and S of God God will always be at your side as you deal with the challenges of life amen praise the Lord the challenges and now God constantly made Away by submission amen so we read Hebrews chapter 10 verse 7 and he says then said I lo I can in the book of the in the volume of the book written of me to doy will that's the way God works God before Christ came and when Christ came he says now those people were testing of what Christ was going to be are you together with me and if we are a portion of that word we are also in the volume of the book we shall find that out in his adoption Christ had to submit the will of the father I come in the volume of the book meaning that I don't want to set my foot away from what is written of me if I'm setting my foot here it should have been written that my foot will be there if I'm taking this CA it must be written that out take that cause my will amen is always underwritten or is always checked out by the written word you don't come up here the God has called me and then you start writing or doing something which is not in the word because when Jesus came he came in the volume of the book If God sends a man he sends him in the volume of the book when God anoints you he anoints you in the volume of the book so where is your position in the if you stand in your volume then God will back you up amen God Amen so you know it's Christ in the king is Christ in the prophets is Christ in the holy man so when Jesus came he saw himself in the volume of the book you would go back into the prophets and look at his path so he came in the volume of the book and I want to set this afternoon also that our inheritance is hidden in the volume of the book also he promises in the word so by Looking Back back into the scripture we can find out who we are we can know God's will in his you know in this season for us let's go down to firster maybe we can understand it better verse 9 receiving the end of your Faith even the salvation of your souls the end of your faith is the Salvation of your soul that's the purpose of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched d who prophesied of the grace that should come after you are you together with me the prophets already prophesy concerning the grace that was coming unto you amen they wrote the book of our in praise God verse 11 searching what what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify how it testified before the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow so the The Works of the prophets testified beforehand and mapped out the path of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ so Christ came to step into his adoption to step into his place and buy the same token you and I come to step into predestin form of service hallelujah hallelujah because it was predestinated for us before the foundation of the world like a Christ came and stepped into the map into the past of his life and he said this point here when Jeremiah said this point here is when Isaiah said this point here is when eel say you your points your sports in your journey that individ is already mapped in the work hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen so in verse 12 what happens here maybe I can say that we grow into our so we have also the volume of book that has gone before us and when Paul read that book he called us written Epistles of all men you become the work amen to express the will of God are you together with me verse 12 he says to was revealed that not unto themselves he's talking about the prophets but unto us the prophets unto us amen they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that had preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost from Heaven which things the Angels desire to look into so as the prophets also preached they were preaching unto you because it says as they preached the things which and now preached unto you so now these things we preach to you we pick them from the sayings of the prophets so God saw you he saw you in this season hallelujah hallelujah it was not in the days of Noah it is in this season where God saw and when God spoke about you he wanted you to come forth now because this is where your position is it's not in the days of Moses it is now so I want to tell you my brother God is not a man a man testes before he di but godes before he gives birth so we come here to step into the position which God has ordained for us so God Minister down to us the book of volumes of our inheritance prophets and the apostles let's go to Ephesians 1 1 he says in whom Soul we have obtained an inheritance in who in Christ being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workes all things after the Cel of his own will so you are in Christ your inheritance is guaranteed amen once you are in Christ your inheritance is guaranteed in whom also we have obtained an inheritance and he gave some Apostles some prophets Hallelujah so our [Applause] inheritance is not the [Music] same amen then he says whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith amen everybody in a gift which God gives him he gives him a proportion don't jump your borders our ministry verse S let us wait on our ministry oh he that teaches on teaching oh he that on he that give let him do with simpli with Dy cheerfulness every has got a position and brother James was teaching last Sunday about the different positions how can we identify them amen so I thank God for the scripture says let us wait on our ministry oh he that teaches on teaching if God called you to teach when you wait on the LA the teaching anointing which comes because that's your will that's your inheritance that's what God has given you and I always wait on the Lord until the word unfold you are in bed you jump out at midnight because you've been waiting before I preach here I preached the message for about a week or two Amen in my mind and then you were doing this I sent him the scriptures I was going to use this morning but when we went along he discovered hey these were not were not there and then I saw him fug so you keep preaching you finish preaching you see there is a way God works we come by the volume of the book you need to see your calling and then search out your [Applause] borders by the volume of the book in order to maintain stability amen I will repeat this we come by the volume of the book we see our calling and then search our borders by the book and that is stability if God has called you to be a teacher what is a teacher what's the purpose there and find out discover your borders if God has called you to be an apostle go into the world your B amen I repeat the third time you come by the volume of the so where is your inheritance it is in the volume of the book when Jesus came his inheritance was in the volume of the you can never come with anything that's not in the volume of the because our inheritance was predestinated before we were born the foundation of the world it was M out it was given borders this is Zeon he cannot go beyond that when the children of Israel were being born amen the PS everybody mother was crying a certain way and the mother in the Le P he cried in a certain way and the way C the Bain also meant the area of inheritance in the promised land are you together with me amen that is God yes sir before they even there amen God knew where they were going to be and as they were being born God was allocating inhance amen meaning by the Seas somebody else's corner but don't do that you can never raise Cor in ep's corner if you are you got to take your place in Christ positionally take it amen yeah you take your position that's where you are blessed amen your own landow a straight straight line so the right seeds God will always bless you your own borders amen if you are a housewife your marriage is your B don't interfere in another man's marriage youry your marriage that's your B that's where God blesses you amen amen adoption by the volume of the book amen keeping your own calling amen adoption is in him and that's in the volume of the book that's what verse 11 said Ephesians 1 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance outside of him there's no inheritance but in him we have obtained an inheritance out a little bit you know when you out of the Border you lose the signals of the guide you know it's just like this the form it's gazed to work range if you go out of the rench you lose the signals yeah hello I'm not hearing very well Al you lose the signal you don't hear from the [Laughter] father and yet adoption works by constant submission hallelujah hallelujah you have gone here there is a challenge Moses goes back to the father God gives him more instruction again he goes forward challenge he goes back to the father that's how God works with he'll never give you everything you have need of God wants to walk with you one day at a time amen listen here the prophet says how was our inheritance given to us through what predestination predestination is for knowled how did God know he could trust you to be a preacher his for knowledge not that will or he that run God that showeth Mercy that's right predestination he knew what was in you he knowed what was in you before the foundation of the Earth he know that was in you before there was even on Earth that's the infinite God Amen we are we can only think that's the infinite God away from him you detach yourself from The Inheritance because in him only when in him when you step out you lose the signal so our inheritance is a daily submission of the Christ was talking to the Jews who understood the principle of The Bling of a son praise the Lord because they knew that a son to bet trayed and be brought to understanding the trade of his father so that he can be able to make right judgments over the father's business therefore this prodal son had gone through the entire process and when he asked for what belonged to him so that he could go into a far country and exercises adoption the father gave him to prove him there are certain times we do things to teach people you let them do that they may learn from the experience the father was a very experience man so he says this boy wants I will give him I want to prove him but without me you can do nothing that's adoption without me you can do nothing so the father allows you sometimes amen and he allows you to go knowing he has got the ability to bring you back praise the Lord so that you may learn my experience that's why there's the principle of the good sheer who goes after the Lost ship are you together with he you a little bit you were so much anxious you desire you go beyond the borders God will let you go that you may learn by experence he allowed the prodal side he gave him what belonged to him and he went into a far country went further the borders and when he lost the signal wouldn't manag the F anymore are you together with me the boy knew one thing he was smart is that he had an inheritance that was a very great Revelation that I have an inheritance but how you manage the inheritance is another question but he knew he had an inheritance and when the father gave him he went and messed it up why because he went beyond the Border when God commits his inheritance you you must stay in the father's will because the father's will is your [Applause] will praise the Lord adoption is continuing in submission to father look at this adoption here I mean Abraham is going out of the natural life he called all his children those that He with KRA and is and gave them gifts but Abraham but Isaac remained with him as hair of all things are you together with me the gifts sometimes without him you miss mismanage them you mismanage them but he said I want is here don't go away I want you to stay under submission for the management of all this estate are you together with me adoption is Solomon anointed as king before his father was dead so the will of the father is different from our natural will because our natural will involves death but the will of God only requires submission to his presence know your borders remain humble to him that is stability amen because our inheritance is called haip are you together with me we learn that it was when Isaac remained with this father and his took the gift we know it was C when Israel cried out and said God Save the King God Save the King was going on his father's M and David was still alive we know it is God trusts us with positions in the [Music] but we must understand our B my father is rich in houses and land that's what the scripture says not will be rich but he is Rich he holds our inheritance in his own hands amen amen so our land of adoption is predestinated but you must win the battles of character in order to remain in your inheritance child training amen like Israel needed child training across the Red Sea across the Wilderness across the Jordan and the battles of possession so we need also our training to win the battles in your child training justification sanctification then the bapm with his own life that's the way God prepares us to go into our inheritance in some of us studing the Galatians yesterday morning we were looking at a child when he born a child much as his of all things he's not better than than a servant until he has been trained through child training am I a child of God yes you are what is my possession I know what it is just be patient with God is taking you through the process to possess your inheritance let's get a little bit um do you give me some 30 minutes amen keep looking at your watch I don't want to be like brother Tim who says do you give me some five minutes how many people give me five minutes then he counted about 200 then he says okay time so uh ification all of us we start the Journey of cleansing of character through justification let's go to I mean Romans chapter verse 1 and two therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this gra weing we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God justification by faith that gave you peace with God and open the door into the grace wherein you stand amen justification what is justification is God Beginning to Look At You different from what he looked at you before you repented your past but when you repent your past then you are Justified and the priesthood this Grace where you stand is not the one of Aon it's the priesthood of in his priesthood Hallelujah hallu he's the [Music] Creator but Aon could not create but God himself the priesthood in this place where we he becomes the Creator he only he alone can bring conviction to any man and the justification is the work of the Holy Ghost and once he comes to work in your life he creates you into new man there's there no condemnation that in Christ and new creatures is the priesthood of Grace the pr that has created you into a new man amen now after justification he was still being tuted into character you are taken into your sanctification John 1717 sanctify them through th truth word is trth the word is our only means of sanctification there's no other way my laws will not JY my L they become just some kind of traditions of aner it's obedience to a man it doesn't change you but the world is what will change you as we hear believe and perform that word then we are [Music] Sanctified are you together with me let me tell you the Galatians were better than some of our people today the Galatians held on the law which came from Moses god to Moses but today what people call law in our churches is even has nothing to do with God it's not even the law it's the traditions of the elders how can you say you've got the Holy Ghost when you come to church late everybody comes very early how can you say you have the Holy Ghost when you miss two services in a week everybody comes to the services that will not help you want God to convict your life by the word that's what brings the B of the when God has reached your life by sanctification of your spirit it makes you a new creature but you know there is a nature human nature when something they had nothing to eat in the wild and then God would give them money and they still said we are tired of this bread now what will you eat that's human nature as long as nature is not converted it will get tired of everything amen it will get tired of everything when the pastor begins to bring these lessons on your phon other things that's an unconverted nature what can we do you know have they think we also what can we do that's human but as a minister you continue you may be helping one or two you see you never take wisdom from a man I did my posting I tell you I tell you but that's the nature of a man the traditions of the elders have nothing to do with our sanctification sanctification is a work of Grace that teaches the word into the soul of a man to make him a new creature amen ification is believing sanctification is the cleansing the Holy Ghost is the feeling of Life brother Bram says so after teaching them three and a half years he told them turn in Jerusalem till you be ued with life so justification is the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit statements of brother BR so it is the character of Christ that will bring us to the predestinated purpose to the world to do thy will God are you together with me that's what we should be saying I come to do to the world to do thy will oh God if we suffer with him with him suffering with him is a cause to adoption he did not suffer because he was a sinner rather because it was necessary to build character hallelujah hallelujah if he that was born sinless could be T to develop character how about us praise the Lord so I'll go to the doctrine of the testator here as I'm finishing amen when the testator dies the power of possession comes to the hair amen and I want you people to make your personal Wheels let me you a little bit without a will you can dilize the church because people take sight I'm the one who was with my dad most of the time were just there abroad make your personal Wheels amen amen s Luke 12 13 15 and one of the company said unto him master speak to my brother that heed The Inheritance with me he said unto him who made me a judge or divider over you they come to [Music] the now Pastor I want you to reconcile us our father died without a will now this one big house this small one for us and Jesus says yes who has made me a judge or a divider over you go and make your wheels and he said unto them take heed and beware ofous man's life consist not in the abess of the things he has so I want to say here that God's children Must Die Tate we must make our will to help in church stability because it always comes back here when we started out were boys 40 plus years 45 4 years ago amen no thought about death but many of us have beg to live dying intested shows a lack of love for your family and it destabilizes the church we should not get in cornered into walls of inheritance God's love put him forth according to the volume of the book it pleased God so let's look at the mystery of his will here and then we shall go to Jeremiah and finish amen Jeremiah said much as I'm buying from my cousin and I'm going to die maybe I not live 70 years I need the Testament here so the Myster of God's will for you is hidden and then revealed in the word in the word is where we find the revelation of who we are the will of your inheritance the will of your inheritance is in the word in the adoption message part four brother Ephesians 1 and he says having made known unto us the mster of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself yes sir then after reading this scripture brother says this words and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or God's every one of us has to seek out the will of God for himself for how do we find out Paul it was known to him he said he didn't confer with any man no Flesh and Blood he went to no school no Seminary he had nothing to do with it it was revealed to him by Jesus Christ who met him on the road to Damascus in a light like a pill of fire and called him and went to Arabia and there DW three years oh three years Paul was down there in Arabia rented him a little building somewhere walking up and down the floor with old Scrolls in his hand amen he was in a little room he was in the scoss that's how found it out he would pounce back and forth when sleep was about to take him then he would put that scroll down he would pick up another one because Paul knew that the will of God every individual was written in the book Hallelujah It Was Written In the book upon you his will was detriment in the world and that's where the will that defines you individually is hidden also hidden in the world when you feed on the word you'll be able to know who you are when you say the word you will find sections of the will of God that pertains to you amen so the inheritance is hidden in vessels which vessels you are Hallelujah and you study the word from the inside you study from the level of revelation the Holy Spirit Will sh some lights upon certain hidden areas of the world that you that is me that is me because you are standing before the mirror of God's word you you don't read you study uh-uh you don't just read like a man reading a new paper you [Applause] there we call it feeding from the you feed from the clet of your soul because the fresh man was kept in the holy of holies so you withdraw you withdraw from the public into the closet of your soul to be able to study yourself into an inheritance that's what did with himself amen into closet Amen in Arabia and he s himself into the volume how many of you will seink in the volume of the amen you pick the Bible and stud take the tpes and hear them take the books and read them and you are going to say now I see why brother Steven says the things he say many people say where do you get these things from they are in the world you have to stand them they give you an inheritance they give you a change of Direction amen you allow God to speak to yourself oh praise God yes sir the volume of the book amen now let's look at Jeremiah and H here God told Jeremiah that cin would come to him that he could redeem his land because the rights of redemption was in Jeremiah's and Jeremiah b the land Amen on the strength that houses and Fields and vineard shall be possessed again in the land Hallelujah hallu hous and vineard shall be possessed again but Israel was going into captivity was going to chasti knew that once a son always a son do you hear what I say but you can feel a little bit of weakness a little bit of failure in your life and then you start saying I think I'm not unelect but Jeremiah says again in this land hous and lands shall be possessed Amen Let The Devil not sit on you permanently once you were a child of God you were known before the foundation of the you can be weak but that's for a while be like Jeremiah houses and lands shall be possessed today there will be a return in the land of possession amen so brother Bram uses this scenario to teach on Revelation 5 on the book which was written within and on the back side of the book but I also want to look at the angle where he uses it to describe where the documents were kept Amen brother Bram descries the documents but we want to dwell on where the document was kept hallelujah hallelujah it was not kept in Golden vessels it was kept in nothing vessels vessels represent you that was formed Out of the Dust of the Earth are you together with me brother Bram says and it was kept in Earthly [Music] vessel shows where the power of God and the Scrolls and the secrets of God is known in the heart our Plan of Redemption the same being kept in the earth Jesus name in our hearts amen and the Revelation so I want to tell you friends that there is something on the side of you hallelujah hallelujah once you take this book here and you studed it [Music] copy Hallelujah when you stand it it will Echo with something in the is something on side there will say yes yes yes and then something begins to change on the outside of you because the inside is aging on the outside the outside is agreeing on the inside the open copy and the closed copy say you are a son of God copy and the open copy encourage you to testify the copy and the close copy encourage you to pray you are completely in the will of God fulfilling the will of God your will is already written hallelujah hallelujah where is it kept on the inside of you God on your inside has kept sections of the w he has kept them on side and as he stud the word which is the open copy on the inside there there is something which jubilates that somebody is coming to the knowledge of the will of God Amen so we Retreat to the closet of our heart and that's what Paul did in the desert of Arabia in order reach his inheritance we have an eternal life through the grace of God so this treasure that we hold in this vers amen not put in there by man but by the power of the resurrection of God something is on the inside hallelujah hallelujah it was placed in the SE gen of God the foundation of the world and God has permanently kept it on the side of did you hear that you have something that identifies you as a Son of God in there is where God has kept your inheritance it's not something you going to look
