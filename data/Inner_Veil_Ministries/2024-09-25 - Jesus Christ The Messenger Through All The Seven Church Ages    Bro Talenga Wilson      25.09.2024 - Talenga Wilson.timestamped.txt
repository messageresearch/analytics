[10:53] edified in Jesus Christ we
[10:56] pray amen amen
[11:05] amen it's such old
[11:09] evening amen but we thank God for his
[11:14] grace that we are finally
[11:17] here amen let's get on our
[11:22] feet and now that we are very
[11:25] few I would request that we we come and
[11:30] up the
[11:32] front amen amen so let's get our
[11:37] Bibles and turn to the Book of
[11:41] Revelations amen chapter
[11:45] one amen and we shall pick up from verse
[11:54] 9 amen amen
[11:59] let us
[12:02] read I
[12:04] John who also am your brother and
[12:07] companion in
[12:11] Tribulation and in the kingdom and
[12:14] patience of Jesus
[12:18] Christ was in the is that is
[12:23] called for the word of God and for the
[12:27] testimony of Jesus Christ
[12:31] I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[12:35] day and had behind me great
[12:39] voice as of a
[12:41] trumpet saying I am Alpha and
[12:49] Omega first and
[12:52] last and what thou
[12:55] seest write in a
[12:57] book and send it unto the church the
[13:00] seven churches which are in
[13:05] Asia in
[13:15] Asia
[13:16] sad
[13:18] Philadelphia
[13:21] Andia and I turn to see the voice that
[13:23] spake with
[13:26] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[13:33] candlesticks and in the mid of the seven
[13:38] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[13:42] man closed with a garment down to the
[13:45] foot and got about the PS with a
[13:56] golden may the Lord a blessing the
[13:59] reading of his word we may all be
[14:04] seated amen I want to welcome once
[14:08] again amen and I want to pick pick it
[14:12] from where we we started from on
[14:15] Wednesday last
[14:18] week where we saw Jesus
[14:20] Christ being the Alpha and the
[14:25] Omega amen describing himself in the
[14:28] scripture
[14:30] as the first and the
[14:32] last the beginning and the
[14:35] end praise the name of the Living
[14:38] God and now here we saw when John was
[14:42] telling us what he
[14:45] saw the Bible says that when he was in
[14:48] the
[14:49] spirit he heard behind him a great
[14:53] voice and he describes it as of a
[14:56] trumpet
[15:00] praise the Lord and this is what the
[15:03] voice spoke to
[15:04] him says I am
[15:08] Al and I'm
[15:10] Omega the first and the
[15:12] last and said the things that you
[15:16] see write them in a book and send it to
[15:21] the seven
[15:22] churches which are in
[15:24] Asia praise the Lord And now when John
[15:28] turn to see the voice that spoke with
[15:32] him the Bible says being
[15:36] turned to see the voice that spake with
[15:40] me when he turned praise the Lord he did
[15:44] not turn to see the person that was
[15:47] speaking but he turned to see the
[15:50] voice that spoke to him and he says when
[15:54] he
[15:54] turned he what he saw he saw seven go
[15:59] gold
[16:01] candlesticks and in the midst of these
[16:03] seven golden
[16:06] candlesticks he saw one like unto the
[16:08] son of
[16:10] man closed with a gar down to the
[16:15] foot praise the Lord and now the
[16:18] scriptures describe
[16:20] him that when he was speaking to him to
[16:25] John he said I am the Al and the Omega
[16:29] praise the Lord the beginning and the
[16:33] end and now that means before
[16:36] him he was confirming that before
[16:40] him there was none and after him there
[16:44] was still none praise the Lord and now
[16:48] he's here in the mid of the seven golden
[16:52] candlesticks and now the Bible says he
[16:54] spoke to John and said the things that
[16:56] you hear
[17:00] write them and send them to the seven
[17:03] Church
[17:05] ages praise the Lord and now we see that
[17:08] this is Jesus
[17:10] Christ praise the Lord the Alpha and the
[17:14] Omega and now he's in the midd of the
[17:16] seven golden
[17:19] candlesticks praise the Lord which are
[17:22] the seven Church
[17:24] ages praise the Lord and the B if you
[17:26] continue down there like we saw last
[17:28] week
[17:30] that he has seven
[17:34] stars which are The Messengers The Seven
[17:37] Church
[17:39] ages and then he started giving the
[17:42] message to deliver the message to the to
[17:46] each of the
[17:48] ages to the first age the first church
[17:53] Ephesus he said
[17:55] right praise the Lord and again the
[17:58] second age
[18:06] says
[18:08] Philadelphia
[18:11] Andia so to each of the
[18:14] ages there was a message being sent
[18:18] out praise the Lord the purpose of this
[18:22] message was to Reve Jesus Christ each of
[18:26] thees
[18:35] amen amen so now the Bible says write
[18:39] the things that you have
[18:40] seen and send them
[18:43] out that is the voice that he turned to
[18:46] see praise the Lord the voice that he
[18:49] turned to see instructed him to get the
[18:53] things that he saw and
[18:57] heard then them to each of the
[19:02] stars that were in his right hand so now
[19:06] we see that
[19:07] Jesus who was in the midst of these
[19:09] Church
[19:11] ages he held the Seven
[19:14] Stars he held the Seven
[19:17] Stars and he was sending them out
[19:22] [Music]
[19:31] amen
[19:47] Amina amen
[19:51] am what
[20:17] so now he had he got the
[20:19] message and gave the message to each of
[20:22] the
[20:24] messengers to go and reveal Christ in
[20:27] each of the ages
[20:31] for our text
[20:32] tonight the title
[20:35] is Jesus Christ the messenger through
[20:39] all the Seven
[20:42] Ages praise the Living God so now if we
[20:45] go back to a little
[20:47] history we know that God praise the Lord
[20:52] sent Jesus
[20:54] Christ in form of a
[20:57] body when he wanted to redeem us back to
[21:01] himself when he wanted to reconcile
[21:04] Us Praise the Lord he had to make a
[21:08] body the body in form of Jesus
[21:12] Christ when he sent the angel to
[21:15] Mary and he spoke to Mary that would
[21:19] bear a son and his name would be called
[21:23] Jesus praise the Lord the Son of God so
[21:27] now God made himself a
[21:30] body in order to come and Deliver us to
[21:34] save us from sin so he
[21:38] condescended praise the Lord and He tled
[21:42] himself in the body as
[21:44] Emmanuel Son of God and he came and did
[21:49] suffer and then he was
[21:53] crucified and then he
[21:55] resected when he
[21:57] resected praise on the third day he met
[22:01] the people he met the
[22:03] disciples he met
[22:05] them he made the disciples and gave them
[22:10] instructions and then he told them that
[22:13] he would come he would send a promise he
[22:17] would come in form of the Holy
[22:19] Spirit to instruct the
[22:23] church to guide them through the
[22:26] truth praise the Lord so again when he
[22:29] are sended up on the day of
[22:32] Pentecost again
[22:34] descended into the church to teach the
[22:38] church and to instruct the church
[22:41] through the truth because he says when
[22:44] the Holy
[22:46] Spirit is come he shall guide you
[22:49] through all
[22:50] truth and now here when he's revealing
[22:53] himself to
[22:55] John as the alha and
[22:58] Omega the beginning and the end now he
[23:03] says write the things that you're going
[23:05] to
[23:06] hear and send them to each of the
[23:11] churches praise the Lord and he started
[23:14] with the first
[23:15] Ag and the
[23:18] church at Ephesus right and John wrote
[23:22] down and he sent that message and he
[23:26] sent it to the church at Ephesus
[23:29] and search the church at
[23:33] Min then joh wrote
[23:36] it sent it to the church at
[23:39] Min each of those church has a
[23:44] messenger each of the
[23:46] churches had a
[23:48] messenger praise the Lord and now who
[23:51] are this
[23:53] messenger these
[23:54] Messengers and nothing else but Jesus
[23:58] Jesus Christ prise the lord called in
[24:02] this
[24:03] men in order to reveal him to the
[24:06] church praise the Lord each of the
[24:09] messengers were men who were
[24:14] veils and behind those
[24:16] veils was Jesus Christ
[24:20] himself revealing himself the rest of
[24:23] the
[24:24] church praise the Lord that's why I
[24:27] titled it
[24:29] Jesus Christ the messenger through all
[24:33] the seven Church
[24:35] ages praise the Lord so now when he
[24:38] tabernacled
[24:42] himself when he came down praise the
[24:45] Lord he now took the form of
[24:48] man so he takes up the body of a
[24:52] man to bring his mind to the the rest of
[24:56] the people
[24:58] not in a glorified
[25:00] body but in a body just as we
[25:03] are so all the Seven
[25:06] Stars that we are that we are in his
[25:09] right
[25:10] hand praise the Lord those were
[25:14] men that God had
[25:17] picked that God had
[25:19] Chosen and he instructed each of
[25:22] them with a special
[25:25] message to each of the churches
[25:29] praise the Lord and now the prophet says
[25:32] here he says that when Jesus was
[25:36] dying upon the cross he cried and when
[25:40] he was
[25:41] praying he says father into thine hands
[25:45] I command my spirit and here the prophet
[25:49] says when he said that he T the life of
[25:54] of the life out of
[25:56] Christ God told life out of Christ he he
[26:00] took the body and set it on his right
[26:04] hand and then he sent the Holy Ghost
[26:07] back to the
[26:09] church which is the UN which is the
[26:12] unconditional Covenant
[26:14] [Music]
[26:35] [Music]
[26:39] given to man
[26:41] tonight the life of Jesus Christ must be
[26:45] in every individual that is God
[26:50] Covenant and as sure as you are born of
[26:53] the spirit of
[26:54] God the Holy Ghost is in you
[26:59] God is under
[27:02] statement that he raise you up in the
[27:05] last
[27:07] days he will heal the
[27:10] sickness praise the Lord so here the
[27:12] prophet is trying to tell
[27:22] us and when he took up the body of Jesus
[27:25] praise the Living God he told the
[27:29] body and when he tore the body he got
[27:32] the body of Christ and set it upon his
[27:35] right hand and then he got the Holy
[27:39] Spirit and sent it back to the
[27:41] church praise the Lord for one purpose
[27:45] praise the Lord to guide the church to
[27:49] teach the church to reveal Christ to the
[27:53] church so now when he was speaking to
[27:56] each of the Messengers
[27:58] he came down praise the Lord and then he
[28:02] indwelled in each of these
[28:06] Messengers praise the Lord he
[28:08] tabernacled himself in each of the
[28:11] messengers and then he came to speak his
[28:15] word to the
[28:17] people in each of the ages so now we
[28:21] notice that all those
[28:24] Messengers The Messengers that were sent
[28:27] each of the church
[28:29] churches and the message that They
[28:32] Carried was to reveal Jesus Christ to
[28:35] the
[28:37] people praise the name Living God and
[28:40] now we see him standing in the midst of
[28:44] the
[28:45] churches we see him standing in the
[28:49] middle of the
[28:50] church speaking to the
[28:53] church speaking to each of the ages
[28:58] Lord and he had made himself these
[29:01] Stars he had made
[29:06] himself praise the Lord he had created
[29:08] for
[29:09] himself these vessels to express himself
[29:14] into
[29:16] them praise the Lord such that when they
[29:19] stand out to
[29:20] speak when they are speaking they are
[29:24] not speaking words of
[29:26] themselves but they are speak speaking
[29:28] that which they have heard of the
[29:31] father so now the message right from
[29:36] Ephesus
[29:37] toia is revealing Jesus
[29:40] Christ praise the Lord why because it is
[29:43] Christ
[29:44] himself speaking through these
[29:48] Messengers that's why the message of
[29:51] Paul in the first church age the same
[29:55] message that William and preached
[29:59] praise the Lord why because he's the
[30:02] alpha and he's the Omega he was in the
[30:05] beginning with with
[30:07] Paul in the first church and he spoke to
[30:11] Paul and he gave him the
[30:13] instructions and he gave him the message
[30:16] and Paul spoke the
[30:18] message Paul instructed the
[30:20] church he told the church through all
[30:23] the
[30:24] truth he told the church he called The
[30:27] Church
[30:29] repentance he rebuked sin and he told
[30:32] the baptism of the Holy
[30:34] Spirit and he told that man should first
[30:37] of all
[30:38] repent and when man believes and they
[30:42] confess and they baptized they shall
[30:45] receive the gift of the Holy
[30:47] Spirit praise the Lord and when will
[30:51] came he never taugh anything different
[30:54] from what Paul
[30:55] taugh he also rebukes
[30:59] he also told the people that they must
[31:02] repent and be baptized in the name of
[31:06] Jesus
[31:07] Christ for the remission of sins and
[31:10] they receive the gift of the Holy
[31:13] Spirit why because Paul heard from The
[31:18] Voice William and Bram heard from the
[31:21] same voice is Jesus Christ
[31:25] himself speaking to the churches
[31:28] praise the name of the Living God and
[31:31] now in the message
[31:35] sadan San Church
[31:37] H now we can see that Jesus
[31:41] Christ is revealing himself Through the
[31:45] Ages by his Spirit In The
[31:49] Messengers they are just as
[31:52] Moses was to the children of
[31:55] Israel as he had Revelation for
[31:59] so as he had Revelation for his
[32:03] day so each
[32:06] messenger had God's
[32:09] revelation and Ministry for that day so
[32:13] just like
[32:14] Moses he had the
[32:17] Revelation and the re he
[32:20] had reation he had was to redeem the
[32:25] children of Israel
[32:28] moved them from
[32:29] Egypt to the promised land that is the
[32:33] message he had praise the Lord for his
[32:37] day that is the that was purpose of God
[32:41] he could not reveal
[32:43] Jesus he could not Reve the birth of
[32:45] Jesus he could not teach them about
[32:48] baptism the message that God gave to him
[32:52] was a message to move the people from
[32:56] Egypt to Canaan
[32:58] and he says that God did the same thing
[33:02] to each of the
[33:05] messengers each
[33:07] messenger had God's
[33:12] revelation of them received God's
[33:16] revelation and the ministry for that
[33:19] day that's when we see the messengers
[33:22] are in his
[33:24] hand we see the Lord identifying himself
[33:27] with these
[33:29] men and granting them his
[33:33] power praise the Lord it is not enough
[33:37] that he has Associated
[33:39] himself with the whole
[33:42] church which we saw when he was seen
[33:45] standing among the seven golden
[33:50] Lambs no is it even
[33:53] enough that we see the fivefold ministry
[33:58] of Ephesians
[33:59] 4
[34:02] Apostles prophets teachers
[34:06] evangelists pastors for each for in each
[34:11] age the church goes
[34:13] astray and it is not just the
[34:17] L but the CL group shepherds are are
[34:22] wrong as well
[34:32] then God brings himself on the scene as
[34:35] the Sheep
[34:38] Shepherd so we see what the prophet is
[34:41] telling us
[34:42] here
[34:44] Christ praise the Lord he gave each of
[34:47] the messengers a
[34:50] message because in each of the of the
[34:54] churches the people went astray
[34:58] so God had to send a
[35:00] voice God had to send a
[35:03] message to bring the people back to
[35:06] himself in each of the ages so the
[35:10] purpose of this was to bring the people
[35:14] back to
[35:15] God recile the
[35:17] people back to God praise the Lord so he
[35:21] said in each of the
[35:23] ages that people went AR even the
[35:27] Shepherds went
[35:28] as then God brings himself on the
[35:32] sea as the Sheep
[35:35] Shepherd in the
[35:37] ministries of these seven men to lead
[35:40] his people back to the
[35:43] truth his ultimate
[35:46] purpose in each of the Ages was to bring
[35:49] the
[35:50] people back to the
[35:52] truth praise the name of the Living God
[35:55] so we see Christ himself coming coming
[35:58] down God himself coming on the
[36:01] sea in the ministries of these
[36:05] men the seven golden the Seven Stars The
[36:10] Messengers to each
[36:12] age God comes down praise the Lord he
[36:16] comes into these men and then he starts
[36:19] rebuking the
[36:21] generation he rebukes the church he
[36:24] rebukes them of sin then asks them to
[36:28] repent praise the Lord then he brings
[36:31] them back to the
[36:33] truth from
[36:35] Ephesus he rebuked them and turned them
[36:38] to the truth in sadness he rebuked them
[36:42] and brought them back the truth to
[36:45] Philadelphia
[36:47] toia he rebukes them and brings them to
[36:51] the
[36:52] truth it is the same God Walking Through
[36:56] the Ages
[36:58] to reconcile us and bring us back to the
[37:02] truth praise the name of the Living God
[37:05] is the same
[37:07] Christ revealing himself to the bride in
[37:10] each
[37:12] age and doing the work of calling
[37:15] out by way of
[37:18] rebuking
[37:19] cleansing and preparing the
[37:22] church and preparing the bride in each
[37:25] of those ages
[37:27] for
[37:28] eternity praise the Lord and then
[37:31] Through The
[37:33] Messengers the church is able to receive
[37:36] Jesus
[37:37] Christ praise the Lord by which he
[37:40] expresses
[37:42] himself then he comes All Through the
[37:46] Ages praise the lord we see him when he
[37:49] spoke Through the
[37:50] Ages then now he comes down to the
[37:53] seals which bring down his secrets
[37:57] that had been hidden from the foundation
[38:00] of the world the same
[38:03] Jesus praise the lord we see him in the
[38:06] Revelation chapter
[38:08] 5 when the angel when John said I saw in
[38:13] the right
[38:15] hand of him that sat on the
[38:18] throne a book
[38:21] written within and on the back site
[38:24] sealed with Seven Seals
[38:28] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[38:30] with a loud
[38:33] voice who is worth open the book and to
[38:37] lose the seals
[38:39] there and no man in
[38:42] heaven on Earth nether under the Earth
[38:47] was able to open the
[38:49] book neither to look there
[38:52] own praise the Lord so when John saw the
[38:55] book on the thr
[38:58] the book having Seven Seals he had the
[39:03] angel
[39:04] proclaiming who worthy and he says there
[39:07] was no man in
[39:09] heaven on Earth that was able to open
[39:14] the book nether look there own and he
[39:18] wept because no one was
[39:20] worthy and verse five says and one of
[39:24] the ERS said unto me
[39:28] weep
[39:29] not the same Jesus that was in the
[39:33] middle of the seven golden
[39:36] candles instructing the
[39:39] church through all the ages is the same
[39:43] Jesus that we see coming down and taking
[39:48] the seals and revealing them to the
[39:52] church praise the Lord no one was worthy
[39:56] except himself
[39:58] and says Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[40:02] Judah the root of
[40:04] David has prevailed open the
[40:08] book and lose the seals
[40:12] [Music]
[40:16] thereof and I beheld
[40:19] and in the midst of the
[40:22] throne and of the
[40:24] fasts and in the midst of the elders
[40:28] St a lamb as it had been
[40:32] slain having seven
[40:35] horns and seven seven eyes which are the
[40:39] seven spirits of
[40:42] God praise the Lord which are the seven
[40:46] spirits praise the Lord which he sent
[40:49] into the
[40:50] Earth to instruct the
[40:53] church to guide the church to bring
[40:56] theur church back to the
[40:58] truth it is still
[41:01] Christ who had the seven
[41:03] [Applause]
[41:04] hnes and the Seven's eyes which are the
[41:08] seven
[41:10] spirits Christ praise the Lord back to
[41:14] the church to reveal the
[41:18] secrets to reveal the
[41:20] seals to each of the church
[41:24] ages and he came and took the book out
[41:27] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[41:29] the
[41:33] throne and when he had taken the book
[41:37] the four and the four and and 20 Elders
[41:40] fell down before the
[41:45] [Music]
[41:48] lamb having every one of them
[41:52] HS and golden
[41:55] FS full of oers which are the prayers of
[42:01] saints and they sang a new song
[42:04] saying thou
[42:06] worthy to take the book and to open the
[42:10] seals
[42:12] thereof for thou was
[42:14] slain and has redeemed us unto
[42:20] God and has redeemed has redeemed us to
[42:25] God by thy blood out of every
[42:29] Kindred so the same
[42:32] Jesus praise the Lord the same
[42:35] Alpha and Omega the same that was in the
[42:39] midst of the church
[42:42] ages even through all the church
[42:45] ages he is the same praise the Lord that
[42:50] had a
[42:51] power to
[42:52] redeem that had the power praise the
[42:56] Lord redeem the book from the
[42:58] judge so he here who the power to redeem
[43:03] us unto
[43:05] God that's why they all suang a new
[43:08] song say to take the book and open the
[43:13] seals there are
[43:14] of because you were
[43:16] slain and now you have redeemed us to
[43:20] God by your own blood and you've made us
[43:24] unto our God Kings and Priests
[43:31] so now we see
[43:33] Christ praise the Lord once again
[43:37] condescending coming down into the
[43:41] church praise the Lord when he came down
[43:44] to each of the church
[43:46] ages he never came once and left but
[43:51] when he comes through the
[43:54] messengers he gives them a message to
[43:57] take to the people and when the people
[43:59] receive this message they are receiving
[44:03] Jesus Christ and when they accept the
[44:06] message praise the Lord when they
[44:09] believe the message of their day they
[44:12] are receiving Jesus Christ and when you
[44:16] receive Jesus Christ praise the Lord and
[44:19] you accept him and you confess him and
[44:23] you repent of your sins and you are
[44:25] baptized
[44:27] then receive the new
[44:30] birth Christ
[44:32] himself he comes to
[44:35] indell in the person so now it
[44:40] ceases to be a group
[44:44] aair because when he sent the
[44:47] messengers he sent the messengers to the
[44:50] church which is a group of people praise
[44:54] the Lord he sent the
[44:56] Messengers full age which had so many
[45:00] people but now when The Messengers come
[45:02] down with a particular
[45:05] message this message goes down to any
[45:08] individual
[45:10] person so it is upon us as individuals
[45:14] to receive the
[45:15] message and believe it because when
[45:18] Christ comes he comes to deal with
[45:22] us on individual
[45:25] basis praise the name of the Living God
[45:28] and now when he comes to deal with us on
[45:31] individual
[45:33] basis now that's when we receive the new
[45:37] birth and the new birth is Christ
[45:41] himself praise the Lord he has separated
[45:45] you and set you apart and he has
[45:48] cleansed you by the preaching of the
[45:51] word and when you're
[45:54] worthy and you're fully cleansed
[45:57] he indwells
[45:58] himself and he makes an
[46:01] abort in your soul by the baptism of the
[46:04] Holy Spirit then he begins to guide us
[46:09] he begins to teach you the Bible says he
[46:13] guides us through all
[46:15] truth it now begins to be an
[46:20] individual praise the Lord he has
[46:23] revealed himself to the
[46:25] edge but each person in every
[46:28] age must receive him as an
[46:32] individual each person in every age must
[46:35] come into that person
[46:38] experience with the word of God being
[46:41] revealed in their
[46:42] day and the people in the age of Paul
[46:48] had to receive Christ
[46:52] individually the same with us in this
[46:54] age
[46:58] each of us must receive Christ as an
[47:03] individual it becomes an individual
[47:07] affair because he has
[47:09] condescended and now he has
[47:12] himself in the words praise the Lord in
[47:16] the message of the
[47:18] messenger and now through the message we
[47:22] are able to receive him as individuals
[47:27] why
[47:27] salvation to us
[47:30] Gentiles is not a group
[47:33] Affair it is an individual fair and each
[47:37] of us must
[47:39] hear when we hear each of us must
[47:42] receive Jesus Christ
[47:46] personally it doesn't matter whether my
[47:50] father is a
[47:52] preacher whether my father is the
[47:55] messenger of this age
[47:57] I must receive Jesus
[48:00] personally that's when you become born
[48:04] again when you receive Jesus Christ
[48:08] personally because when he
[48:10] condescended on the day of Pentecost he
[48:14] came and indwelled each one of
[48:16] them that were in the upper room praise
[48:20] the Lord he never took over the whole
[48:22] church but he came and sat on each one
[48:25] of them
[48:27] it was an individual
[48:29] Affair praise the Lord they shouted and
[48:33] said you're worthy you're worthy because
[48:37] you have taken the book and you're
[48:39] worthy to open the
[48:41] seals you were killed and by your
[48:46] blood you have redeemed us unto
[48:49] God praise the Lord by his own blood he
[48:54] redeems each one of us
[48:57] unto God and the Bible says and you've
[49:00] made
[49:01] us to our god Kings and
[49:05] Priests how does he make us unto our God
[49:10] Kings and
[49:13] Priests it has to be through the new
[49:17] birth praise the Lord it has to be
[49:20] through the
[49:22] new when you receive the Holy
[49:25] Spirit you receive the new
[49:28] birth then he becomes a part of you and
[49:32] become a part of him praise the Lord and
[49:35] the prophet says in the message
[49:38] identification now in so
[49:41] doing when he was
[49:43] slain he took our
[49:46] place when he was slain he took my
[49:50] personality when he was slain he took my
[49:54] entire
[49:55] life he replaced it with
[50:00] his by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[50:04] praise the Lord because when you accept
[50:07] him when you accept the message for your
[50:10] day you receive Jesus Christ and when
[50:14] you receive him you must be born again
[50:18] and when you are born again and you have
[50:21] received the Life of Christ in
[50:25] you now he takes over your
[50:28] part he takes your place he takes over
[50:32] your life and he sees us to be you but
[50:36] it is Christ that is
[50:37] living so now when he takes over you he
[50:41] takes over your whole life he takes over
[50:44] your
[50:45] weaknesses praise the Lord he takes over
[50:48] your
[50:48] sins he takes over everything about
[50:52] you praise the Lord and then in the fa
[50:55] trials that you your
[50:58] first it is Christ praise the Lord that
[51:02] helps you to
[51:03] overcome in your weaknesses it is Christ
[51:07] that encourages you it is Christ on the
[51:11] inside of you that teaches you the way
[51:14] of
[51:15] God why you become a part of him and has
[51:19] become a part of an individual Affair
[51:24] now praise the Lord and now what
[51:28] proves that we have the right
[51:32] Spirit what
[51:34] proves that we have the spirit in our
[51:38] Edge is
[51:40] accepting the message of our day praise
[51:45] the Lord you cannot say you believe what
[51:48] Paul preached you leave the entire
[51:51] message of
[51:52] Paul praise the Lord and then you reject
[51:55] the message
[51:57] of William Mar
[51:59] Bram praise the Lord there is something
[52:02] wrong because William
[52:05] Bram preached exactly what Paul
[52:08] preached he picked from the same
[52:13] route it was the same person it was the
[52:17] same Jesus who was in the midst over the
[52:21] seven Church ages praise the Lord so
[52:24] what shows that you have the the r
[52:27] spirit is when you accept the message of
[52:31] your day because it
[52:34] aligns perfectly with the
[52:36] message of all other
[52:39] Messengers when Paul preached he
[52:42] preached the
[52:43] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:46] Christ praise the Lord and you cannot
[52:48] say that you believe the message of Paul
[52:52] when you reject the baptism in the name
[52:56] of the Jesus
[52:57] Christ and how do we test
[53:00] them praise the Lord
[53:03] Willam when he came to preach he
[53:06] preached the
[53:08] message and preached the baptism in the
[53:12] name of the Lord Jesus Christ remember
[53:17] when uh when they received the the Holy
[53:19] Spirit on the day of Pentecost the same
[53:23] Jesus Christ when he descended once
[53:26] again
[53:27] and he came among the people when they
[53:30] stood out there when Peter was
[53:34] preaching he rebuked the people he
[53:37] rebuked them of sin and told them
[53:40] repent each one of you and be baptized
[53:45] in the name of Jesus Christ when he
[53:48] stood out to preach he preached to them
[53:51] Jesus Christ resurrected he preached to
[53:55] them that he was was dead and now he's
[53:58] alive when Paul was preaching he
[54:01] preached Jesus Christ resurrected when
[54:05] Bram was preaching he preached Jesus
[54:07] Christ resurrected and says each one of
[54:11] us must be born again and must be
[54:15] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[54:19] when we do that we have the gift of the
[54:22] Holy Spirit praise the Lord so believe
[54:28] faith in this
[54:30] message praise the Lord your
[54:33] obedience toward this message entitles
[54:37] us to the New Birth praise the Lord why
[54:41] you
[54:43] accepted Jesus Christ himself praise the
[54:46] Lord because the message of
[54:48] Bram is not his
[54:53] word but it is Christ Jesus himself
[54:58] raling himself to the seventh Church
[55:03] age behold I stand at the door and
[55:06] knock an indid call I stand at the door
[55:10] and knock any man hear my voice when he
[55:14] opens the door I'll come into and he
[55:19] will be with me and I be with him praise
[55:23] the Lord an individual affair
[55:27] he sent first the
[55:29] message and then Bram told the
[55:32] message and then he left the message
[55:35] which is Jesus Christ and then the
[55:38] message he says I stand at the
[55:41] door each one of us has a door each one
[55:46] of us has the soul each one of us has to
[55:51] open the door for Christ to come in and
[55:56] when he comes in he gives us the new
[55:59] birth praise the name of the Living God
[56:03] he now dwells in
[56:05] Us Praise the Lord and now I want us to
[56:10] go down here we
[56:13] notice that when he comes
[56:16] down he takes our
[56:19] place for the Bible says he takes away
[56:23] our iniquity
[56:26] receive his
[56:27] Revelation when we accept his words when
[56:31] we believe the message of our
[56:33] day which is the word of
[56:36] God Jesus Christ comes in and then he
[56:40] takes away our
[56:41] iniquity he takes away our sin and he
[56:45] takes
[56:46] over for the Bible says in second
[56:50] Corinthians 5 ver
[56:53] 21 for he has made him to be sin for
[57:00] us who knew no
[57:02] sin that we might be made the
[57:05] righteousness of God in
[57:08] Him Praise the Lord so he made him
[57:13] sin he made him
[57:17] sin praise the Lord when he got this
[57:20] body of Jesus
[57:22] Christ and he gave it up
[57:26] at Calvary at the cross to sacrifice him
[57:31] for our sins so he became sin for
[57:35] us yes he knew no
[57:38] sin that we who have accepted
[57:41] him we who have accepted his
[57:45] words we may be made the righteous of
[57:48] God in
[57:50] him through the new
[57:52] birth praise the Lord so now
[57:57] when he takes
[57:58] over he pours himself in
[58:01] Us Praise the Lord and he makes us the
[58:04] righteousness of
[58:06] God but this does not mean that you are
[58:10] free from trials that you are free from
[58:15] TRS we are not free from these TRS as
[58:20] long as we still have these Veil
[58:22] bodies but as long as he still stays on
[58:25] the
[58:28] he says I know I know your weaknesses I
[58:32] know your
[58:33] works I know your
[58:35] history I know your
[58:37] history but I have taken over praise the
[58:41] Lord him taking the form of
[58:44] man replacing
[58:47] us to live in our place to feel our
[58:53] pain praise the Lord to live through our
[58:55] weak
[58:57] to encourage us to fight for us all the
[59:01] battles that we may
[59:04] encounter praise the Lord but still he
[59:06] gives us
[59:08] strength then he fights to
[59:10] overcome because he lives on the
[59:13] inside praise the Lord his purpose is to
[59:17] make sure that you and I are righteous
[59:22] before God that is his purpose that the
[59:25] reason
[59:27] God sent him upon the cross to die for
[59:30] the sins that's the reason he sent him
[59:33] down in the form of the Holy Spirit to
[59:37] come and indwell each one of
[59:40] us to support us through all our
[59:44] weaknesses to arrive each one of
[59:47] us to the state of a perfect
[59:51] man such that we are
[59:54] ready we are worthy
[59:56] when we are presented before
[59:59] God but right now because he sits inside
[1:00:03] of
[1:00:04] us he presents himself before
[1:00:08] God as a perfect sacrifice for our
[1:00:12] sins he presents himself before God as a
[1:00:17] sacrifice worthy of all our
[1:00:20] iniquities praise the name of the Living
[1:00:22] God so when we stand before
[1:00:24] God he already recognizes the
[1:00:29] sacrifice which is Jesus Christ to
[1:00:32] receive all our
[1:00:34] petitions and forgive us of all our
[1:00:36] troubles and forgive us of all our sins
[1:00:39] and
[1:00:40] iniquities praise the name of living God
[1:00:43] and the Bible says the eyes of your
[1:00:47] understanding in Ephesians 1 verse Verse
[1:00:51] 18 the eyes of your understanding being
[1:00:54] enlightened
[1:01:10] 118
[1:01:13] be the eyes of your understanding being
[1:01:20] enlightened that you may know what is
[1:01:22] the hope of his calling
[1:01:26] and what the riches of the glory of his
[1:01:28] inheritance in the
[1:01:36] Saints and what is the exceeding
[1:01:39] greatness of his power to us what who
[1:01:42] believe according the working of his
[1:01:44] mighty power
[1:01:56] has wrot which he wrote In
[1:02:00] Christ when he raised him from the
[1:02:03] dead and set him at his own right hand
[1:02:07] in the Heavenly
[1:02:11] places amen our understanding being
[1:02:14] enlightened by the
[1:02:16] truth by the
[1:02:19] word the spoken word Christ expressed in
[1:02:23] his word
[1:02:26] side at the right hand of
[1:02:28] God above all
[1:02:32] principality and power and
[1:02:34] M and dominion and every name that is
[1:02:39] named not only in this world but also in
[1:02:42] that which is to
[1:02:44] come and has put all things under his
[1:02:49] feet and gave him to be the head over
[1:02:52] all
[1:02:54] things to the church
[1:02:57] which is his body praise the Lord so now
[1:03:00] God got all
[1:03:02] things into Christ and the says he has
[1:03:06] put all things under his
[1:03:09] feet not
[1:03:11] some put all things praise the name of
[1:03:15] the Living God so now when Christ
[1:03:17] becomes a part of
[1:03:20] us when he becomes a part of you praise
[1:03:24] the Lord he takes over your life and
[1:03:27] puts all things under his
[1:03:30] feet all your weaknesses under his
[1:03:33] feet all things under your
[1:03:36] subjection says he gave him to be the
[1:03:39] head of all things to the
[1:03:43] church which is nothing else but his
[1:03:47] body praise the Lord fullness of him
[1:03:50] that fth all in
[1:03:54] all he has made all things to be under
[1:03:57] Christ so he has got
[1:04:00] Christ the word and gave him over to the
[1:04:04] church to manifest him because the Bible
[1:04:08] says here that he gave him to be the
[1:04:11] head of all things to the
[1:04:14] church which is his body and the church
[1:04:17] the B is talking
[1:04:19] about a bunch of
[1:04:21] people but it is an individual
[1:04:26] says that we are the Tabernacle of
[1:04:30] God praise the Lord so we are the
[1:04:33] Tabernacle of
[1:04:34] Christ so God got this Christ in the
[1:04:38] form of the Holy Spirit and he gives him
[1:04:41] over to us to sit in our souls and then
[1:04:45] he puts all
[1:04:47] things under his feet talk about our
[1:04:51] weaknesses praise the Lord talk about
[1:04:53] the hardships
[1:04:56] talk about the failures he gets all
[1:05:00] things and puts all of them under his
[1:05:03] feet praise the Lord and then he gives
[1:05:06] us
[1:05:07] control because he has control over all
[1:05:10] things and so the fullness of
[1:05:13] Christ is poured into the church which
[1:05:17] is his body to manifest him the fullness
[1:05:21] of Christ all that Christ was is given
[1:05:26] to you praise the lord it's given to the
[1:05:30] church it's given to indwell in our
[1:05:34] bodies to manifest him and then he takes
[1:05:37] this
[1:05:38] church this Tabernacle of
[1:05:42] mine this
[1:05:44] viers and takes control over it he's in
[1:05:48] control over
[1:05:50] everything he is in the body bringing it
[1:05:54] under subjection
[1:05:57] to his own
[1:05:58] leadership praise the Lord he was in the
[1:06:01] midst of the SP
[1:06:03] candlesticks and then he became part he
[1:06:06] became the
[1:06:08] church praise the Lord by getting this
[1:06:11] message and bring it to the church
[1:06:15] Through The Messengers and then Through
[1:06:17] The
[1:06:18] Messengers The Church receives him and
[1:06:21] when the church receives him the Bible
[1:06:24] says God gets the
[1:06:27] Christ and he pours it into the
[1:06:30] church to live in the church to control
[1:06:34] the church to guide the church to bring
[1:06:38] the
[1:06:39] church his own
[1:06:41] subjection to bring the church to the
[1:06:44] truth that's why the prophet says that
[1:06:47] time the church goes
[1:06:50] astray each time the church
[1:06:53] weakens God himself
[1:06:56] Jesus
[1:06:57] Christ praise the Lord he comes down and
[1:07:01] he takes over the
[1:07:03] church by way of The
[1:07:05] Messengers through the message and he
[1:07:08] rebukes it and he turns it back to the
[1:07:11] truth praise the Lord and that's how we
[1:07:14] are able to receive
[1:07:16] him because himself must
[1:07:19] come and take over the words praise the
[1:07:22] Lord and then he gives us his words
[1:07:26] he reveals himself to us and then he
[1:07:29] asks us to open the doors of our heart
[1:07:33] and open the door of our hearts he comes
[1:07:36] in and says when I come in I'll shut the
[1:07:39] door and no man will be able to open it
[1:07:44] when you receive the New Birth the H
[1:07:47] Spirit doesn't come to come and go but
[1:07:51] he comes to stay to teach us through all
[1:07:54] truth he comes to prepare us he comes to
[1:07:58] guide us to walk upon us until we are
[1:08:03] perfect to prepare us for the wedding
[1:08:06] supper Colossians
[1:08:09] 1:12 giving thanks unto the
[1:08:12] Father which has made us meat to be
[1:08:16] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:08:17] Saints in
[1:08:24] light has delivered us from the power of
[1:08:28] darkness and has translated
[1:08:30] us unto the kingdom of his dear
[1:08:33] son in whom we have Redemption through
[1:08:36] his
[1:08:42] blood our
[1:08:44] Redemption is is through the blood even
[1:08:47] the Forgiveness of sins who is the image
[1:08:51] of the invisible
[1:08:52] God that is Jesus Christ the firstborn
[1:08:56] of every
[1:08:57] creature for by him were all things
[1:09:01] created that are in heaven and that are
[1:09:04] in Earth visible or
[1:09:07] invisible we saw that last week him
[1:09:10] being the spoken words that in the
[1:09:13] beginning all things were created by
[1:09:17] Him Praise the Lord and the Bible says
[1:09:20] for by him all things were
[1:09:23] created that heaven and that are in
[1:09:27] Earth visible or
[1:09:29] invisible whether by the
[1:09:32] Thrones all
[1:09:34] dominions all principalities all powers
[1:09:38] all things were created by
[1:09:41] Him and for his
[1:09:44] purpose and now he is before all
[1:09:51] things and by him all things consist
[1:09:56] and he is the head of the
[1:09:58] body the church praise the Lord when he
[1:10:02] comes when you receive him and he makes
[1:10:06] an AB in you he becomes the head of the
[1:10:09] church he becomes your head and all
[1:10:13] things get under his
[1:10:16] control who is the beginning and the
[1:10:18] first
[1:10:20] B from the de that in all things he made
[1:10:25] have the
[1:10:26] preeminence he's the head of this
[1:10:29] Tabernacle he's the head of your life
[1:10:32] he's the head of my life is the head of
[1:10:35] the bright praise the Lord that's why he
[1:10:38] brings all things under
[1:10:41] subjection and now when the bride
[1:10:44] recognizes that Christ lives on the
[1:10:47] Insight she has the
[1:10:49] potential to overcome all
[1:10:52] trials she has the ability
[1:10:55] all battles why Christ on the inside he
[1:11:00] has control over
[1:11:02] everything not some but
[1:11:05] everything for it pleased the father
[1:11:08] that in him should all fullness
[1:11:13] dwell and having made peace through the
[1:11:16] blood of his
[1:11:18] cross verse
[1:11:21] 20 having made peace through the blood
[1:11:24] of his cross
[1:11:29] by him to reconcile all things unto
[1:11:31] himself by
[1:11:35] him by him I say whether they be things
[1:11:39] in Earth or in he or things in
[1:11:44] heaven now and
[1:11:47] we that we are sometime alienated and
[1:11:50] enemies in our mind by Wicked works
[1:11:58] yet now has he
[1:12:01] reconciled through Jesus Christ the
[1:12:05] blood of Jesus Christ that is the
[1:12:07] ministry of The Messengers to reconcile
[1:12:11] us to God reconcile us to Christ so each
[1:12:16] time we get
[1:12:19] AR brings his
[1:12:21] blood praise the Lord to reconcile us to
[1:12:25] himself in the body of his
[1:12:30] flesh through death to present you holy
[1:12:34] and unblameable and
[1:12:37] unreprovable in his
[1:12:42] sight that is it that was the goal that
[1:12:47] is the goal death he took on the church
[1:12:52] he took on this body he took on your
[1:12:57] he may present himself in my
[1:13:01] place as holy without any
[1:13:05] blemish praise the Lord not just without
[1:13:10] blemish praise the Lord not just without
[1:13:14] blemish but unblamable
[1:13:16] that means when we in
[1:13:19] Christ when Christ is in us and we in
[1:13:24] him we cannot be
[1:13:26] blamed because before God We Are Holy
[1:13:31] praise the Lord and then he takes his
[1:13:34] glory and he gives it to us to bring us
[1:13:38] into
[1:13:39] Unity of the Spirit by word to bring us
[1:13:45] into the sub Obedience of the
[1:13:48] word in John 17:22 he
[1:13:52] says and the glory which th Gest me I

[1:19:05] the same Jesus Christ through all the
[1:19:09] ages praise the name Living God and the

[1:19:43] was save you he become
[1:19:46] you that you become him he took your
[1:19:50] lord of

[1:19:56] we will not have to stand we could not
[1:19:59] stand in the presence of
[1:20:01] God there is no way for us to do it but

[1:20:25] receive you as
[1:20:27] holy without any
[1:20:29] blemish and when we do this we can do

[1:20:37] us and when we shall see him which is
[1:20:41] now we shall see him as he is and we
[1:20:45] shall know that he is in the father and
