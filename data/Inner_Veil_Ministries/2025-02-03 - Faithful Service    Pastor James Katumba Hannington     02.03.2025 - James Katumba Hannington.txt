you may come and speak to us again bless us again in such a special that your purpose and will may be done upon this service in the name of the Lord Jesus this amen I request somebody to close the water we shall be having a baptism service I think after the Lord supper maybe during foot washing amen so let go to marthew chter 24 and then verse 45 Matthew chapter 24 verse 45 up to verse 51 so the Bible says who then is a faithful and and wise Steward whom his Lord has made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so very I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods but but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my Lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants and to eat and to drink with the drunken the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he lookth not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him a s and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth may God bless of his word you may be SE so this afternoon I just want to more of continue with what we had in the morning but we want to focus on faithful service praise the name of our Lord faithful service so the lord requires us to do every service Faithfully you know being faithful in the things that the Lord has committed to you being faithful in the work that you're doing being faithful you know in the responsibilities that you're doing because somebody has committed to you what you have and you'll know that at the end of the day there will be somebody concerned how are these people praise the name of the Lord like let me just put it this way like when you marry you marry Somebody's Daughter or you get married somebody's son either side will concerned about their person in that relationship the The Father's Side the husband side they'll always want to find out how is their son and sometimes they can become suspicious maybe he's being mistreated oh my son is not being given enough food or maybe there's some conflict and they will always want to find out what's happening at even the other side even if you have stayed for 10 years the other side wants to know how is our daughter how is our son because they are concerned about what they own I found my brother was annoyed the other day I found my sister is annoyed the other day and those who can be rush they can start saying you're mistreating my son you're mistreating my daughter you know they can just get phone calls and call you maybe they realize it is not so maybe later they realize it is not so but then the message has reached home don't mistreat my daughter my son so there is a concern on either side but then we are require to be faithful and then he says who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord has made ruler over his household to give them meat in this season blessed is that servant whom is Lord when he cometh shall find so doing in other words in our services we are meant to do what is required of us what the Lord has really appointed you and you know when the Lord appoints you to do a certain thing do it with all your heart you don't do it as men Pleasers praise the name of our Lord you do everything with your heart and you know there's a scripture here which I want to read we should have read it in the morning but we didn't read it let us go to the Book of Luke Luke chapter 17 and then we start reading from Luke 17 and then verse 7 he says but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding CLE will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meet you know he is a servant so his responsibility is to serve you so now the whole day has been in the field and he's tired and now when he comes home you're not going to tell him go and sit down and eat when you have a respon when you have a service for him to do he says and will not rather say unto him make ready therewi I may sa and guard thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunken and afterward th sh eat and drink that's what the scripture is saying says when he comes back much as is tired even if the food is in the kitchen and for you in the sitting room and then he has come from maybe far and then he has reached but as long as it's your Serv please serve me food don't say you have been here you mean you have not been seeing the no he says that is your responsibility then he says does he thank that the servant because he did the things that were commanded him verse I TR not so likewise ye when you have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do amen he says say we are unprofitable servants in other words I've done that which is my role and even if people don't thank you don't appreciate for what you doing just be happy that you've done what you meant to do praise the name of and be content with that and then you know you do it with joy you know because the Bible says as you are doing whatever you doing you are doing it unto the Lord not doing it unto men and these are the things we just need to know that in our stewardship in our services we are serving the lord we are not doing it unto men now in Ephesians 6 and verse 5 he says servants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the the flesh with fear and trembling in singl of your heart as unto Christ so he says do it be obedient to your masters with fear and trembling in singleness of heart as unto Christ not with eyes Service as many Pleasers but as Servants of Christ doing the will of God from their heart with Good Will doing Service as unto the Lord and not unto men you may have a Ser a master at your place of work and it doesn't fear God but still as long as you have work there the Bible says you need to give him respect and when he's given you assignment do the assignment as if you are doing it unto the Lord notto your [Music] master that's the scripture says so now in every work that we do we need to do it Faithfully faithful service you do it you know you do it as your best do it as if it's the only thing for you to do praise the name of our Lord you know like sometimes maybe if I'm a work at home there is this example here you know there are people who are hired to clean toilets now what some of these people do they loock some toilets but why are the TOs built they leave only one room and then the other three rooms are closed now they know that maybe at Mid this one will be very dirty so he comes and loocks the dir one and open another one which is clean then why you given that job you know they don't want to do work or they will give excuses and then some will pretend as if they are too busy when the work is too small how can you be cleaning the same room for one you know so you are not you're doing it with high service when when they are coming then you are busy now when they away now you know this when you he's coming and there are some people who go to their Gardens to dig they're just there the they holding the whole like this then they start conversing they went ear enough inste of digging now they start feeling we what small I'm so tired the sunshine is too much you feel the Sunshine because you're not working but if you are working you move first and then you leave you know so there are some with those kind of wrong attitudes and they places of work assignment you give them it's too much work too much work work they gave you that because actually you have the job because that work is hard but if it becomes easy you have lost your job why would they hire if the work is not worth why so then we need to appreciate the things that God has given us to our responsibility and then you do it diligently you do it with all your heart praise the name of our Lord this what the scripture is talking about not with I service not as men Pleasers but you're doing your work as if you are doing it to the Lord and that's how you can be blessed because you're recognizing that what I'm doing I'm serving the lord and then the scripture says in verse 8 knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does the same shall he receive of the Lord whether he be bor or free now he says whatever good thing you do sometimes you're working for a master and he is not happy about what you're but you're doing the right thing sometimes you're working for a master he doesn't appreciate you at all but the master in heaven should be the one to to be pleased most even this one when they don't say thank you do the best you can do and then the Bible says then of the Lord you will also be rewarded for what you have done whether you are bound or you are free in other words whether you are saved or you are not as long as you are doing work that is worth of worth of Praise of honor the Lord will bless you in that whether you in his kingdom or you're not in his kingdom that's concerning work he says he will give you the reward praise the name of our Lord like if you are a diligent farmer you are doing your work very diligently the Lord will bless your G whether you are born again or you not born again that's about work so then we need to be faithful and then we have another challenge that a brother or a sister when they get to work for a certain believer they despise that word they not [Music] serious why are you working there you working there for free if you know that you are being paid not that they can remove you and put another person and again don't say that brother is heartless you fa to do the job given you work open the shop by 7 for you are coming at 9 now what will he do and sometimes you hear them I give that brother work he doesn't want to do my work then the brother sometimes when he's out of work oh pray for me I get but when you get work you desp it you don't finish the work you on this then immediately on another you have not pleased the other one why don't you finish the other one thoroughly say that from what you have done you can now recomendations to get another job but then you on this on this half Hazard you losing out so then we need to see that we give honor praise the name of our Lord to the bosses that we have whether he born again or is not born again whether he understands or he doesn't understand like here in our country even here in Gia you find most of the companies are owned by Asians and you know some of them your bosses don't know even what to do he's just there putting you on pressure to learn from you finish finish finish finish finish finish he's busy learning from you he doesn't know your he's your boss write report he wants learn from because he your boss but then there are some others they want this one to go away when he comes he pretends as if he's doing something but then he's doing the wrong thing you know there are somewhere like that when he knows your me to connect this wire in this place when the boss comes tries to pretend as if he passes here and the thing fails to work when the says they calling me then he comes fixes very fast people are very chcken just just to pretend but the Bible is telling we shouldn't do as I service and then verse and you Masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening if you a boss at a place of work why would you threaten why and you know some places God has given you a privilege that there are many people under you but now as a child of God be an example to them praise the name of our Lord why would you demand them to greet you first when for you when you meet them which is okay for them to greet you first but why don't you so go and say how are you but then when they are greeting you just busy walking you can't have some bit of time to talk and you can't tell the Affairs of your workers but you know you need to see that you live in a community with that kind of friendship and relationship maybe you have people who help you at home but you don't care how they sleep you don't care what they are eating you don't care how they are maybe they are really but you don't care I pay you my money you need to work you know there is a way you need to do it as you doing it to the child of God so he says you Masters do the same unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also in heaven there is neither respect of persons with pra the name of so you need to see that you are Faithfully in the services that the Lord has committed before you first Timothy 6 verse one the Bible says let as many servants as are under the Yoke Count Their Own Masters worthy of all honor that the name of God and his Doctrine be not bamed so he says if you a servant count your master with all honor give them respect he's your master you know there are some companies again they owned by families oh big rich people then they bring their child of maybe 14 years that is your boss sometimes is younger than your children is your because you want their money here is your boss you know there are some scenarios in life which are challenging but you have gone to their place do the work faithfully and then he says and they that have believing Masters let them not despise them because they are Brethren but rather do to them service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit these things teach and exalt amen he said even when you have a master kind person don't exploit him don't take things don't take him for granted my the time I reach when a problem comes you may end up being losing that job that's what may happen so you need to be faithful serving do everything diligently they given you an assignment do it in time and deliver and you know some people don't know that the more you on a particular work is The More You Hinder more work to be given to you so you're hindering your progress you are hindering your income you are hindering your Eary and you know this this places of work sometimes it can be a place of opportunity to get a better job than what you have but how will you get a better job if you are despising what you have now you're not doing it effectively who will be attracted to your work nobody will be attracted there's a brother here okay we had a brother here and then he was working Ina in a certain Farm or company in the marketing section and then know he was doing work well and it so happened that he he handled some work with a some top manager in one of the big companies in the country and now this the way he handled this work of course that's how would do you know but now some people want to work for you when known you a big that's service even somebody who you think is nobody do the work well maybe you're working for example in public offices the government and maybe somebody has an issue or maybe somebody has put in a request handle it diligently as you would handle it for another person that's the attitude we need to have a place of work you don't say if he a woman I'm going to Del if he a man I'm going maybe to do this if he a child said don't come to you do it Faithfully so this brother handled the work and he pleased this man but he didn't know that this man was responsible so when opportunity came in that big company for a particular work he came back to this young and asked him can you get a job in this place said it's okay said okay you apply this is this and this and this so he applied and he got a very big job being paid I believe more than 10 times what was earning in this job but how did it come because of serving Faithfully even when the job was small but he did it diligent that's what the scripture say if you are faithful in the little you'll be faithful in the mar now if you are failing the small one to do it diligent how are you going to be given a bigger responsibility you'll end up making the company collapse praise the name of the Lord so now the Bible is telling us let us not despise when our masters are believe but then we do it diligently we do it you know with all our heart a Believer has given you some work to do you now you can afford to delay the [Music] believer patience about to pay your money will you be patient with him because you're working because you want to [Music] earn diligent you know let us do the work with all our hearts What the Lord Has put before us praise the name of the Lord now David when he was a son he Faithfully served his father and the father would send him go and do this David would be on that business know there sometimes when you have children at home you send a child yeah you can't buy for me this instead of buying the thing is just with the friends maybe he has reached in a place and then there are some of these people who are showing some magic and things like that and then goes there stands around the people and he forgets that they have sent him anything that was not David they send you to do this you go and do it come back that was David now when he was given the role of being a shepherd he was faithful that when he saw the bear coming he didn't take off but go went ahead against the bear to save the Sheep when the lion came he did the same and now when David was a soldier under Soul he was faithful praise the name of our Lord he was faithful until one of the priests in second in first 1 Samuel chapter 22 and then verse 11 verse 15 then the king sent to call aich the priest the son of aibu and all his father's house the priests that were in no and they came all of them to the king and Saul said here now though son of aibu and he answered here am I my Lord and Saul said unto him why have you conspired against me though and the son of Jesse in that thou Hast given him bread and a sword and Hast inquired of God for him that he should rise against me to lie in weight as as this day then answered the king and said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as David which is the King's son-in-law and goeth at thy biding and is Honorable in thine house so now was giving a testimony that David is faithful in the house of Saul David is faithful in the Kingdom of Saul until Saul would persecute David you know in this instance here Saul made sure that all the seven priests are killed because of David and then he goes and still hunts and chases for David and now David understands that Saul is after him he goes and hides himself and when he hides himself still Saul keeps on looking for him until one day sa was tired with his army and they were sleeping and then David came to their camp [Music] and one of the Servants of David said God has given us our enemy and David said don't do anything wrong don't touch the Lord's anointed don't hurt him so David praise the name of our Lord let us go to 1 Samuel chapter 26 and then verse one and it came to pass when Saul returned from following the Philistines that it was told him saying behold David is in the wilderness ofed 1 chapter 24 verse1 1 samel CH4 vers to now then Saul took 3,000 chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the rock of the wild Gods continue okay and he came to the ship cats by the way where he was there was a cave and so went in to cover his feet and David and his men remained in the sights of the cave [Music] and the men of David said unto him behold the day of which the Lord has said unto thee behold I will deliver thine enemies into thy hand that thou shalt do to them as shall seem good to thee then David arose and cut off the scirt of Saul's Rob privately praise the name of our Lord and so David his heart could not allow him to do harm to Saul Saul was his master sa was his King and David was a servant so now David you have a king as a servant you are required to be faithful to the king in other words there is no harm that should come to the king and you know so David was convicted when he cut off Soul's garments but then he went out to show the king yeah and then show him you see what has happened to your Rob to show him that God has given you in my heart but I couldn't kill you I couldn't do any harm to you then sa went back again s he has David is and then again he come he was always after the life of David to see how he can do harm to David now in second 1 Samuel chapter 26 praise the name of our Lord and then the scripture says and then verse five and David arose and came to the place where Saul had prited and David beheld the place where Saul lay and abna the son of Neil the captain of his host and so lay in the trench and the people pitched around about him for then said abish to David God has delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day now therefore let me Smite him I pray thee with the spear even to the Earth at once and I will not Smite him the second time said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed and be Guiltless David said furthermore as the Lord liveth the Lord shall Smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and the Lord forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed but I pray thee take th now the spear that is in his bolster and the cruise of water and let us go praise the name of our Lord so then when David had gone with the things of sa he stood a far off and then he called the Servants of sa AB the captain why aren't you doing your job Faithfully there are people who came to the camp where the king is you see what he was meant the the bolster see where they know the water are they still there and then AB was saying don't make noise for to keep the king if wanted do they would have done and then you see how David now was telling abam in verse 14 David cried to the people AB the son of saying not abna then abna answered I said who are you to cry to the [Music] king but the man was sleeping he was sleeping on his job then things were becoming a mess then he said David said unto AB not a viant man and who is like thee in Israel wherefore then hast thou not kept thy Lord the King for there came one of the people to destroy the king thy Lord the thing you have is not good that you have done as the Lord liveth you are worthy to die because you have not kept your m Master the Lord is Anointed and now see where the king spear is and the cruise of water that was at his bolster so we need to be faithful in our service abna was not faithful in his service and then David Is Telling You Are Meant to die because you have not kept the king and now when s realized that it is David then he said oh my son and then he said why are you chasing me that was David asking him why are you chasing me from my in inance you know I've done nothing wrong to you and then David says in verse 23 the Lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness for the Lord delivered you into my hand today but I will not stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed so David was faithful in his services that he wouldn't see want to do anything wrong to his master much as his master was against we need to do services to the Lord in faithfulness praise the name of our Lord and God has given you your responsibility God has given you your stewardship because he has counted you to be faithful that's why you given so then fulfill the trust that God has given unto you that he has committed a certain role to you he has committed a certain responsibility to you then you do it like now Paul says in first Timothy 1 verse [Music] 12 1 vers and I than CHR Jesus our lord who has enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry so when you have a ro the one who has given you that Ro the one who has committed that stewardship to you has counted you Faithful so don't disappoint the person you know don't disappoint them somebody has given you their money like the Bible says in Matthew 25 we can go there we meant to read it in the morning but we didn't have enough time Mathew chapter 25 and then verse 14 for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his Goods he says hiss and then he gave them his Goods like we looked at the morning we are not our own our own lives are the lordes even what we have is thees we are his servants and he has given us his Goods the talent that you have the gift that you have the job that you have the family that you have the work that you do it's the Lord who has given it to you so he says he gave them his Goods and one he gave five talents another two another one to every man according to his several ability and straight away he took his journey so God gives us based on our ability at that time if God has given you something be thankful that something and do it the best you can he's measuring your faithfulness now if you Faithful in the small God has given you he says I'm more than able to give you more the way God was telling David he told David if such and such were not enough I would have given you more let us go to 2 Samuel chter 12 praise the name of our Lord 2 Samuel chapter 12 and then we read in verse verse 8 and I gave thee thy Master's house and thy Master's wife into thy bosom and gave Thee the house of Israel and of Judah and if that had been too little I would have more over have given you such and such things [Music] praise the name of the Lord is saying what I've given you if it is less is small or if you have learned how to manage it better if youve learned how to manage what have given you [Music] better then I would give you more praise the name of our Lord say he delivered to them his Goods [Music] one he gave five talents another two talents another one talent and he says based on their several ability and now the ability that they had would enable them to multiply their stewardship praise the name of would enable them to multiply their stewardship praise the name of let me put it this way if you can be a good Steward as a father as as a husband if you can be a good Steward as a wife you can be added another stewardship what is that as a husband I'm a faithful Steward to my wife then I can receive the stewardship of being a father that's what happens so it keeps on broadening the more you do Faithfully the more it increases the one was given five Talent was able to trade the five talents and then they became 10 talents and you know the master was interested in their service until the Bible say the one who who got five talents and added more five talents see what reward was given let us go back to MTH CH 25 praise the name of our Lord MTH 25 verse 20 and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord though delivered me unto me five talents behold I've gained beside them five more talents his lord said unto him well done you good and faithful servant you have been Faithful over a few things I will make you a ruler over many things enter th into the joy of thy Lord says good and faithful to the world had five Talent people were saying yeah you have too much but the master was committed to you little because he owns a lot praise the name of the Lord so we need to be faithful in all our services if God has given you anything in be faithful in that service be a faithful Steward and then you see how the Lord will expand it praise the name of our the Bible says if a man is diligent you know he will C what he has praise the name of our Lord and then it talks about parents that they even live wealth to their great grandchildren faithfulness in stewardship that's what we should do praise the name of the Lord but then you get in some places the father has had a lot of things when when the father dies and the children take over they just sell things they were not raised they were not trying to take over to manage those businesses your father has left you with 10 acres but after 5 years you on a plot you know it is dangerous so we need to be faithful stewards we need to Faith y serve the things that the Lord has given unto us and now what the Lord has given you you know like he says one who was given one Talent he buried it he never traded it he never put it in action praise the name of the Lord so we need to see that we use the things that God has given unto us for the purpose of his kingdom if God has given you this gift God has given you that gift use it for the services of the Lord praise the name of our Lord come up and be supportive you see there is a gap here there be supportive over that see that you f that g see that you participate in the work of the Kingdom praise the name of our Lord so we need to be faithful stewards Faithfully serving in what the Lord has given unto us the says what I've given even small he told David if such and such is not enough I have ability to even give you more and give you more and give you more it's unlimited what the Lord can do for us praise the name of our Lord but in our small places of small property in the things we have don't despise the little thing that you have don't despise your small family don't despise your small house don't despise your small job do the best that you can be faithful in what God has given you and then you the Lord will magnify it praise the name of God and thank God for what he has given you if God has given me a bicycle I shouldn't despise my bicycle because another is riding a motorcycle let me take care of my small bicycle why should I leave it to R you know all the time it is full of mud until now the the room is becoming Rusty the spokes have come out SP which are out and I can't replace them I'm not doing well at the end of the day everything will crumble now if you can't maintain a bicyc why you need a motorcycle what what what you under the motorcycle there fuel putting their G servicing but now when you have a motorcycle even don't want take it for servicing the thing is making noise you got the thing in the air at the end of the as if it is 10 years who will give you a c the motorcycle the tires are getting worn out how will you manage your car they are giving you one tire at 200 or 300 or 500 or one million so you need to see that you cherish what you have to show that you are faithful God has given me this morning I like it and then you take care of that they say ah this one can get this will be able to be a better manager and then somebody can you with more things but the you're interested with you can't handle it who will give you more God has given you your own life but you can't take care of your own life how will you handle other people's Liv how will you handle other people's Affairs you know there's that question Jesus was asking I want to pick in that message praise the name of the Lord as I try to finish praise the name of the Lord he said if you have been given your own and you can't take care of your own then who will give you another person's businesses it is somebody else's thing but you're not taking care praise the name of our Lord Luke chapter 16 and then verse 10 he says he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in the March so he's looking at the attitude small don't appreciate you can't say thank you will give you much then he says ver 11 if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mmon who will commit to you your trust the two riches two riches things of this life you're failing how about the true things of the life to come the the question and if you have not been faithful in that which is another M who shall give you that which is your own praise the name of Lord when they give you work you're not fath work how will you get your own how how will you get Capital start your business they give you somebody gives you his business you are just throwing it how will you manage your own if you don't have fear to manage somebody else's thing how will you have self respect to respect what you have and then be patient for it to grow praise the name of our Lord so we need to do faithful service praise the name of our Lord Faithfully serving you know doing everything diligently and doing it from your heart praise the name of our not many Pleasers but doing it as if you are doing it unto the Lord like David praise the name of our Lord you know the Bible says Moses was faithful in all the house of God in other words whatever all God wanted Moses to do Moses was faithful we also need to be faithful in the services of the Lord praise the name of our Lord now in the scripture here in nemiah chter 7 verse 2 that I gave my brother Hanan and hania the ruler of the parish charge over Jerusalem for he was a faithful man and fear God above many nemiah 7 verse2 chter 7 vers so they give you responsibility because they see you can do it it says he gave Hanan and hania the church over Jerusalem for he was faithful man and feared the Lord praise the name of our Lord we need to be faithful in our services praise the name of whatever Ro God has given you be faithful praise the name of Lord as a parent be faithful as a parent as a child be faithful as a child as a husband be faithful as a husband as a wife be faithful as a wife let us be faithful let us be concerned about the things God has put before us praise the name of our Lord concerned at your place of work you that one is the boss's concern concerned see that your work environment is well pray for your work environment pray for your colleagues wish them the best desire Harmon where you are your village is where you stay desire Harmony there desire the best there your home your home desire also the best praise the name of anything good bring it at home praise the name of our Lord now in Proverbs 25: 19 praise the name of our Lord you know this is a scripture which is very interesting he says confidence Proverbs 25: 19 confidence in Unfaithful man in time of trouble is like broken tooth and Joint out of foot out of joint now we need to judge ourselves are you Faithful or you not that one even if you give him a you just say broken joint a broken tooth joint out of a put out of joint now a broken teeth you can salvate for chicken this chicken is good maybe you've G to and then you get it and sometimes you forget that you have a broken to there you want to eat the pain you are salivating for the chicken putting here but the T doesn't do its job it's broken bringing you pain tell me the disappoint when you already paid for that or you are seed in a place and the snake is coming but your joint is out of place the joints are out of place the snake is coming the leg which is meant to help you they are disjointed you try to grow that's Unfaithful person Unfaithful they cannot be trusted they cannot be depended you can't leave an assignment with them and then you are sure he's going to do them you have excuses all the time you know when you left there was this again the other day there is this stories all the time then nobody will be trusting you with more because you're behaving like a tooth which is broken so if a tooth is broken can you feed the mouth you can't if the joint is out of order can you really take off can you fre move you can't so then we need to see that we Faithfully do whatever is committed to and when you say yes let it be yes not yes again no you Mist me I was this speak from the heart what is in the heart is what you speak out if the work is much I'm not able to do it or give me more days oh no there's this and this when you make a mistake learn to be apologetic I'm sorry I fail to do it give me a chance maybe I'll do it better and also work out to improve to do what you meant to be committed praise the name of our Lord so we need to see that we do our services Faithfully you know be faithful in the things that the Lord has committed and then you know it's unlimited what the Lord can give you more say you're being faithful in the you're going to be a ruler over much it's that's what happens praise the name like the job you may be having it may be insignificant but you know when you do it well your bses will realize your character and ability says Ah because that small job is an opportunity for you to be known by other people but then nowadays you get people that have finished school sitting at home do you have any experience anyway do you know what you meant to do and they sit at home don't want to get to work it's just I want to be a boss it's not your father's business even in your father's business he doesn't he doesn't want to take risks you know those people outside or in some places when they want their children to take over their businesses they don't put them up here they put them down here to start learning casual work if it is a farm let him learn how to make Po how to make a fence to dig a hole feet how they put this he also leave some of those things when when he's among them he knows how hard work is when it comes to going to pick animals is not there on phone hey have you brought the animals back he has to go where they are they feeding on that's tutorship that's what they were doing and you know the Bible says that a child as long as he young is not better than a servant actually the servant rules over the child like David when he was young he had a sheep keeper who was teaching him how to keep the so they would go here go chase that can't bring the other one other has given back it up here this is what they do he was under tutorship so they don't just take you to become a manager when you don't know what to manage they ask you how many gos do we have let me go to the records and find out are you really a manager how much money have you made let me check you even don't know the straight things praise the name of our Lord like sometimes I challeng the person how many lers have you made this morning if he goes in the book then you know how there's something wrong here so you must have these things at finger points to know okay my business runs like this my wife does like this like a child going to school and then they come back in the evening and then you ask him what did you learn today and then he goes and picks his books what he has learned has he really learned he was absent minded he can't tell today we learn in geography about the map of Uganda this point this point but if he's just thinking of first reading then he tells what he Lear you don't trust that so we need to be diligent be careful put all your hearts in the things that God is is putting you to do praise the name of our Lord you're ready to talk about what you do you're ready to give accountability how I spent my yesterday how I've spent today you know what I've done through last week I can give somebody narrative yeah you understand what you're doing but now if you start saying oh let me go to my diary okay today you not even forgotten the other day I did this who will give you a lot of work if even a small work you can't give accountability of it but how are you going to give accountability for a lot so then we need to be faithful in our services praise the name of our Lord faithfulness in our services is much required praise the name of our Lord that know when you are faithful in the services of the Lord and then the scriptures told us that you know when you are working for your Masters do the best that they don't Bame you know what to believe they not basing the doctrine because they see your your life your services don't mat with what you're talking about praise the name of our Lord we need to do Services unto the Lord praise the name of our Lord we need to do Services unto the Lord and we do them Faithfully Faithfully in the service not with I service but with the whole of your heart saying Lord I'm here to serve you Lord I want to do what you've committed me to that's what the Lord wants us the name of let us be faithful in our services amen may God bless you let us sing this song as the song leader comes to lead us into praise and worship and prayer then iMed
