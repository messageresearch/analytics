brother SE I believe this is of my family I thank you for praying for the success of our son's wedding Enoch we appreciate the financial support for the wedding amen he mentions brother his wife

Sister father I pray that may grant our traveling mes we also thank you heavenly father for the word of appreciation that has been given by Brother SEI above all father we pray that those young people may have a successful stay together in marriage we also want to commit this service into your hands father and as we go into reading the word we pray that you may anoint it in a special way in Jesus name amen so we shall go to John chapter 1 and verse 14 teaching is very important preaching is wonderful and you can put the church on fire they can claim their promises but better of holding those promises better off holding those promises when you are founded anchored in Jehovah amen John [Music] 114 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the Glorious of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth may the Lord blessing the reading of his word you may be seated so today we are dealing with preaching stability part two and I want to call the service today the word was made flesh amen many times when we talk about the word made flesh we sometimes look so much on Christ but then we forget that the word was also made flesh in the bride and that's where my standing is going to be this morning so I beg to build a foundation to fully establish the word becoming flesh amen so I'll go to the Book of Genesis with you and then I'll take chapter two and out of the ground made the Lord go to grow every tree that's Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen so in this scripture we see our categories I mean we see four categories four categories of trees in the Garden of Eden there were the trees Pleasant to the site you can talk about the flower trees whatsoever there and then you can talk about the trees good for food so you can be talking about fruit trees and then there was another set of trees that stood in the middle of the garden the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil those are two other sets of trees there so we want to concentrate on these two trees that stood in the middle of the garden the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen because when Satan fell he retained what he knew so Satan has knowledge amen but at the same time he is evil that's the opposite of the tree of life and the Tree of Life Is Christ himself so the seven Church edge book it pours more light on those two trees uh which light we would put amen before us Amen to understand the importance of Revelation and discernment so I want you to be stud students this morning because we are laying another Foundation you know we've been here for so many years but then we also have so many other people so here in the Ephesian churches he says religion and spiritual world are made of two trees which had their roots in Eden both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt they very branches inter each other thus in Ephesian church is the same [Music] Paradox are you together with me so we need to understand here that the trees that were good for food was not one tree and then the trees Pleasant decide was not one tree but in the midst of the garden there were two independent trees the tree of life which is Christ and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and that was Lucifer he retained the knowledge of good but he insisted in iniquity amen which makes him evil the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but then we've been told the same Paradox stands in the Ephesian churches meaning that since it has had its seeds right here in Ephesus amen this Tre is going to keep carrying on all this principle is going to keep carrying amen they were in the midst of the garden and now again in Ephesus that's the same thing so these trees have been again planted into the church world that's why the prophet says religion and the spirit world are made up of those two trees which had their roots in Ed so I'll show you something here that one tree is Christ and the other tree is the Antichrist in first John chapter 4 and verse three John is trying to warn the Believers he says and every tree I mean every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh is not of God first first John 43 and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is coming the flesh is not of God are you together with me because it was Christ in eternity he was made flesh are you together with me in the Lord Jesus Christ the word was made flesh and the same word must be made flesh in the it must be Christ in you and if a person comes to church but is not confessing that Christ is alive in his life by the manifestation of his works this is what John is pointing to amen are you together with me so we read it again and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit of antichrist whereof he had that it should come and even now already is in the world so we shall always have those two trees even in every local church we shall always have those two trees amen are you together with me so one must come to a point where he can point to Christ taking over his life amen so the spirit of the Antichrist has always been around right from the Garden of Eden when Christ came into manifestation Judas came into manifestation when Christ was hanged on the cross Judas went and hanged on the tree and that same Spirit was released and came down on the door Pentecost also when the spirit of God came down into body on the day of Pentecost even the spirit of the Antichrist came right down there on the day of pente and that's what John is pointing to and he says now he already in the world are you together with me amen that's the spirit that was mocking the people on the day of pent and saying they are drunk on you are you together with me so this Spirit later amen adopted the name of Jesus Christ in religious worship but their confession of Christ does not come from the heart or El the confession would positively affect the character to a good fruit are you together with me so they adopt the name also in worship they use the very word you use but the difference is when the word is made flesh are you together with me will you be the word made flesh the Holy Spirit controlling your life guiding your works that is what I'm talking about this morning so in the Garden of Eden these two trees were so intertwined listen now that if needed revelation of what she would involve herself into but unfortunately Adam was not in range to give her the spiritual understanding especially when you know it is so hard that this thing you know intertwin I'm trying to come to you this morning amen the prophet says the ch is made up of good and bad two Vines make the church they are like wheat and tears in the same garden growing up side by side but one is true and the other is false now God will speak to each one and will talk about each one amen so when these two are in the same Garden he speaks to both of them and speaks about both of them amen are you together with me so he will call them the church those two together he call them the church so we are looking at the principle of the two trees in the middle of the garden and the same principle keeps going on when Jesus came Judas came to keep the principle when Jesus died Judas died to keep the principle when the Holy Ghost came the spirit of the Antichrist came to keep the princip and he says he call both of them the church and only the elect we really know which is the true Spirit only the elect will not be deceived amen so that's what we have in church again and we need Revelation as we seek to feed on the tree of life that's why church is built on Revelation and to an extent discernment of spirits when we fail in those two areas then there cannot be stability in the local church amen so brother Bram says now remember this Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of Acts are you together with me so Christ the true church is the continuation so the church I mean the book of of Acts is not over because the book of Acts is the Holy Ghost in church it's actually not the book of Acts of the Apostles but it's the book of Acts of the Holy Ghost in the church so he's a continuation of the book of Acts not a repeat the history of the Acts of the Apostles so this means that the book of Acts is an unfolding book through the seven churches Ephesus itself as a chapter to you know this book we can call it a chapter we can call it a chapter amen we can call some minor chapter amen we call chapter because the book is one amen and now the holy ghost in the church is the continuation of that book of Acts amen it is Christ walking through the seven Garden kind it's a church that has been tested and proved amen it is one V but with seven branches all that edges they are just branches of that vine I put a quote to this the prophet in the message believest thou this amen he says I am the Vine quoting Jesus you are the branches well now if that vine put forth the first branch and out of that Branch wrote a book of Acts the second Branch will make another book of Acts the second branch the second Branch will make another book of Acts the third branch will make another book of Acts and never branch that comes out of that vine will be the same as the first Branch was different branches but the life is one and that's the life of the Holy Ghost it was the life in the first church and all the churches that were in the first chur and we still have the same life today that flows through all the Believers and as long as it's the same life has bear the acts of the book of the Apostles this is the principles of Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever continually unfolding his character amen it is Christ releasing the revelation of himself amen upon which the church is built amen I'll give you a few quotes today we go to the revelation of Jesus Christ he says he meaning Satan knows that if the people get the true Revelation listen here of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she the church will be an invisible Army are you together with me that is worth somebody saying amen now this church is not our local church because somebody might say yes I've got a revelation of the true church it is our local church no it's not talking about the local church you must take a note of that the church is talking about is the invisible body built upon the revelation of Christ that's the church that the devil cannot bring down amen and this Revelation that I'm talking about is not the understanding of the godhead is Christ revealing himself in living reality in the different individuals that's Christ coming in the flesh again are you together with me so we want to understand a few things upon which we can build and establish stability as a local church amen this revelation will be Christ in youing living fruit in living I mean in the season so this Christ in you Amen in this bright age cannot bear fruit of Luther's age it must be the fruit of this age that's the Revelation I am speaking of that's the Revelation upon which the church is buil amen so I go and you are going to pick the concept as we keep going so the Revelation is not Doctrine but a living presence of the living Christ until we see him in our [Music] lives th Christ in flesh again the word made flesh amen that's why Paul says you are a written EP that must have life amen that's why he says greater than Solomon is here but expressed in your life who is this not the historic embed in the present tense in your life the Prince of Peace amen the prince of righteousness amen has put on another body not the body of Jesus that was hunged on the cross but you becoming the body of Christ again know ye not that you are the body of Christ and that you are members of that body in particular so we worship The everpresent God Who identifies himself in the present test when he met Moses he did not say I was the god of thy father he told Moses I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob is that amen not I was all the time he is founded on Hebrews 138 and that's what the theme of brother bram's Ministry Jesus Christ the same yesterday is not I will be is not I was but he told Moses I am that I am amen so Christ revealed in SE will not only be the revelation of the person of Christ but it will also be the revelation of his Future Works in the coming seven Church ages that's the book of Acts you see people think they in the message simply because they can explain the godhead what puts you in the Mery is when you are living in the present tense with Jesus Christ you don't know him by history but you know him because he lives on the side of you are the word made flesh again you are written a p R of all men working gospel that's a great Foundation amen thus the book of Acts must be the same life running through the seven branches his fruit in every season amen the revelation of Christ through the seven churches was relevant to the season as I told you that in every local church God hides in the weaknesses of the people because that's where you need your help is not in the strong areas but in the weak areas that's where God hides and then unfolds himself and then you can say this day this scripture is fulfilled because you have seen something which Humanity cannot produce the superatural wants to from our weakness amen he wants to from our needs in the days of Abraham when he was taking his son to go and sacrifice him that was the area of Abraham's need amen and then God comes down to bring down a lamb then Abraham says that's Jehovah go to the local church will always hide in the wickedness of the people and reveal himself day by day by making the people become Overcomers then you start going from glory to glory to glory until you stand in glory himself amen so now the Revelation was always intended to bring his life even in the local churches amen the message we have now could not come in the time of Ephesus the founding of the church it would be relevant are you together with me he reveals himself with our need you tell me I have a weak Pastor that's where you are going to find [Applause] God that's where you're going to find it just keep your ear to the ground he's going to say something God will always be relevant to the need of the edge to the need of a local church as he will be relevant to the need of every individual believer amen your need is different and then he comes before you and he says I'm Jehovah you are not sick that is not helping you we serve a God who is relevant to the needs of his church [Applause] you see what I mean so nobody will import his Doctrine and then dump it on you because sometimes that's not your area of amen God will not just come and testify to you that I am a God who keeps the families together the problem is not that because you are in good union with your wife you want to see God in another area because you've got a sick child you want to see Jehovah RAF God is [Music] always amen so now his true Revelation brings forth the L relevant to the age and the same is true the same is all so true that the true revelation of Christ to you will bring forth life relevant to your position in the body amen yeah you cannot bear my fruit you have your own position in the body you are also a branch to that body so you must bear some fruit praise the Lord okay uh let's go down to Psalms chapter 1 and then verse three he says here and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water whom is David talking about David is talking about you listen to what David say you shall be like a tree thus planted By the Waters and that tree brings forth his fruit not another man fruit but bring forth his fruit in his season his leave also shall not wer andever shall prosper Hallelujah his fruit in his season sometimes your season is the need of temperance that's the fruit you are going to Bear you not talking about the fruit of Faith because that's not your area of a tree planted by the rivers of water be every whole fruit but in his season are you together with me and that's the same way God works with the churches and with the local church he knows what we have need of here amen now every messenger brought forth Divine fruit for his age just like you should also bear Divine fruit which is relevant to the calling of God in your life amen you don't go down kneeling and praying God give me a message today God speak to me and you are not a pastor you are telling God to give you something to preach you see you are not being relevant but when you are a song leader you don't go to God and start saying God today I pray that you may give me a great message you ask God to help you to get into the mind of God for the service so that whatever song you come up with is relevant with the moving of the Holy [Music] Spirit bearing fruit in your season is the evidence of the presence of Christ that you are planted by the rivers of water amen listen to what brother Bram says about you this morning as a tree planted by the rivers of water out of you shall flow rivers of Liv water amen those Rivers will keep going to your branches to bring to fruit your fruit not another man's fruit but your fruit sometimes we are so concerned about somebody else than ourselves it's a very big mistake you go back home did you hear that did you hear that no you feed yourself and come to a level of bearing good fruit we should come to church as individuals because we are not Jews Jews are called out as a nation but for us it's individual calling so I am the Church of Christ which comes together with you to have [Applause] Fellowship listen he shall bring forth his fruit in his season it his the personal pronoun there it is his fruit meaning God's fruit in the season that the Prophet is bringing it hallelujah hallelujah a prophet brings God's fruit in God season for the people so he comes and says it will be in the prophet season God's fruit In God's Time by The Prophet season is it the season of Lu is it the season of Wesley is it the season of Mal he brings God's fruit for the season when he comes as a messenger to the people he says he shall bring for his season his fruit in his season see if there isn't two he [Applause] there bring forth his God's fruit in the season that the messenger is ordained to come he bring forth those are you together with me and it's exactly the same way God works with the local church [Applause] when a pastor comes forth a minister comes forth is bringing God's fruit in God's season in the season that he come so God is speaking to you this morning amen bring forth his God's fruit in the season that the messenger Ed to come now remember that the messenger that brings the fruit of God will bring it in God's seon in the season of the bringer he bring forth his fruit in his season and it cannot wither are you together with me when he brings forth that fruit it cannot wither it has eternal [Applause] life amen it has eternal life amen he says it's got predestinated fruit in there it cannot destroy it because it's predestinated so the fruit it cannot wither it's Eternal and I am preaching stability today God ordained ministry will always plow a straight line amen and will always be in season and if you stand as an individual and catch Revelation and you take that fruit as your fruit it will not with us because it has come in season amen the prophet again says in Revelation of Jesus Christ he says if they get a true Revelation hallelujah hallelujah of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and with the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen that's where Eve failed in discernment what is the right tree she had the intellectual understanding of it but she didn't have Revelation amen so friends it has to be both Revelation and discernment because the two are interwin it is two spirits in the framework of the Christian churcham and the serpent Christ and the Antichrist two trees in the same form no brother Bram preached the message three kinds of believers in every local church God give me Grace To Be A True Believer to be a True Believer we need Revelation and discernment because both these Spirits have come through W's door of reformation and both these trees they populate themselves with [Applause] fruit are you together with me they populate themselves so and this is the condition in every local church and that's why the Gentile church is an individual buil on the revelation of Jesus Christ Israel is called out as a nation they go into this passion as a nation and now they end up Inon as a nation again redeemed from Babylon as a nation going dispersion as a nation again now 1948 in the Feast of trumpet the sixth trumpet amen they are called back again as a nation but they are still blind amen when the bride is taken away again their eyes will be open as a nation for you it is an individual built on the revelation of Jesus Christ are you together with me so this is the condition in every local church that's why we must stand as individuals a church built on the principle of spirit and life not only Doctrine amen because it says the words which I speak unto you are spirit and life meaning that if it's the word it must bring forth fruit is that Amen Let there be light if there was no light that's not God's word the word brings forth life and once you listen to the word and you take it in faith it bear fruit for it to be the word amen so they must bear manifestation of Christ in their individual life you just say Lord make me a fruitful tree amen Revelation 38 he says I Know Thy Works God is not ignorant behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou a little strength you cannot keep the door open on your own but I have set before and has kept my word and not denied my name the word and the name kept the the door open we have a little strength but when whenever the word comes Lord help me to take it amen let me maintain the name which is the character of Christ it keeps the door open are you together with me but while the door was open again the other tree which was in Ephesus came through this door that's how terrible it is so we are going to use this scripture here to understand the two doors the door of reformation which brought back amen which was bringing back the church from the de ages of reformation God kept it open and the enemy sneaked through that door are you together with me but when you know here again here we are both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil still intertwin but God in his wisdom he put another door and this door here is for the individual behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice the individual com to me I eat with him and he with me then he stands in that door the door of the bridge and he says come up here he calling an individual is calling you today come up and through that door the tree of knowledge and evil cannot go through that's the breach praise the Lord so once we catch this then we are standing first to First with stability when you realize this door here I go through it as an individual that is stability praying Lord I understand the principle how you work with the Gentiles you need my soul father amen okay listen to brother Bram here in order to understand the wealth meaning the wealth of meaning involved in behold I set before you an Open Door and no can we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age there is an overlapping meaning melting into Fading Into and not clear clear this age particularly flows into the next age let me show you when the church age is ending and this is another age the life of the old age begins to pep it the new age and then the new age also begins to peep into the old age until now afterwards a new AG starts out so let me tell you do you know what cometh next it's going to be the tribulation after the church is taken out of but all the seeds of the tribulation are here with us they are here with us in the tribulation we have got Jacob's trouble Israel going through their ping amen and right now look at what is happening every nation is throwing them away until they are Christ Hallelujah hallu we come down praise God so of the tribulation here that's the principle of how God works amen and then he says and not only does this age flow into the last age but this last age is in manys simply carrying of the the seventh age a very short age we have brother he always says this is a very short age and then he was always culated and he says big man I don't see the future he was ready he was right his mind had gone ahead of him and God took him but there are some of us TI into the things of this world that we don't even have enough time for God you see what I mean if you are going into the Rapture the seeds that excitement of the Rapture must speak on you now like the seeds of the tribulation have fallen on the Antichrist Lord anoint me with rupturing faith can we say Amen then okay the seventh age a very short age gathers up into one quick work all of the evil of every age and yet all the reality of Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has brought has about run its course the Lan Edge quickly comes in bringing forth both the tears and the wheat into the Harvest are you together with me we are in the harest the separation happens in the Lan churches that's where we are are you together with me so now I I want you to see let's go to MTH 13 Verse 30 you don't have to go continue with the quote because brother Bram just quotes that scripture he says first bind the tears to bur them first bind the ti to bur them but the whe into the are you together with me so there are two activities here the is the Gathering of the tears to burn them but gather the wheat into my so the are gathered here in but GA the wheat into my bur that's the next door which is the bridge where God is gathering you amen that's where he gathers the elect so the prophet continues to say remember please that the sadan age started the Reformation that must still go on until the grain that was planted at Pentecost go through the full cycle of planting watering and nishing until it comes right back to the original SE while this is going on that was s we have to go through that cycle we have a that's exactly what we see happening if you can just think of the Season what's the season you can get a very good picture of it the plant that you see growing in full strength in summer suddenly appears to be going to seed you can't tell exactly when summer become it just Fades into it that's how the edges are and espe two last ages amen so the PRP of those two trees in Ephesus they keep growing together this and that this and that and then when God opens the door of the Reformation to bring the church back from the fall of what happens even this Antichrist tree also comes through and it comes into the Lan church are you together with me but aren't you thankful to God that there is one door for you the door of the bridge hallelujah hallelujah only the elect will enter in there that's the door where says behold I stand at the door and and if any man hears my voice comes out an individual Foundation amen so we must be really watching as individuals this is where we are we are dealing with two different [Music] seeds they come through the door of Wesley and they grow together with the right sea but then as I told you there is another door called the bridge the door that separates the wheat and the tears hallelujah hallelujah praise God but then this door is in itself a spiritual condition this door is a spiritual condition that none can get into it except the [Music] SE th going back into the image of Jesus Christ the word made flesh written of all men praise the lord it's a spiritual condition and the true seed must go in past that door and in here is where we catch the divine revelation the divine revelation of who this Christ is because every age had to have his own Revelation relevant to the challenges of the age so this Revelation which we need in this age is the revelation of who and not the doctr of who he is okay so we are being built on the Rock The Rock of Revelation it must keep hanging over you praise the Lord you see Ephesus was the best and The Rock was there when it grew the rock also grew went up higher went up higher went up higher went up higher that's reation Christ was always over his church but right now he's coming to a point must come and see amen as the headone to the body of Believers so that he can transmit his will in this final Edge that's the revelation of Christ today is the revelation of Christ the person in fellowship with that individual not coming to church to show a presence but father make me better amen you listen to how brother Bram says it in the Blasphemous names he says and that's [Applause] been each Church age has had that rock confession all up to this rock confession of lodia so every age had the necessary identification of Christ that was relevant to them amen amen Revelation 2 verse1 are you here do you love him amen we shall go slow and bring this down when what you miss just go back to the tape in your time and listen to it amen Revelation 21 we are talking about the word made flesh the revelation upon which Christ builds his church not on your knowledge of the godhead that's theological knowledge but Christ becoming flesh so Revelation 21 unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things says he that holds the Seven Stars in his right hand in the midst of the seven golden can the Revelation here to the Ed of Ephesus was the person of Jesus Christ that was walking in the church and as I said last time last week there was no pop with him there was no Cardinal with him there was no Archbishop there was no Bishop there there was no Pastor there it was Christ and the believer the being made flesh a personal relationship amen so he's telling them I hold the Seven Stars in the right hand I walk through the seven I am sov I require Preen in the second age verse 8 and un the end of the church in Sam these things says the first and the last which was dead and is alive so the Revelation here was the person of the Lord Jesus Christ who had the power toher life into people that were dead in sins and trespasses amen and he transformed I mean he he manifested it when he died and rose again so the Rock Box the rock box has always been over every Church AG it is always Christ in everye he comes up at the beginning of the church and he calls them to this revelation of who he is I am he that walks through the seven Goen and then he exactly does that amen so it's always the person of the Lord Jesus Christ in never Church age just working in that church age a certain way but at the end of the Lan Church age and before theum there is a gap that's called the bridge where the qu is gathered into a [Applause] presence put in the gers waiting for the second coming of Christ are you together with me have you been gathered have you been taken through the door of security has God separated you amen from the CH amen as God separated you from the te now this question here is not to the local church but it's to the individual God needs to deal with you as an [Applause] individual listen here brother Bram says the two vines that grew together and intertwin their branches and now to be separated they are to be separated you cannot have one foot in organization and one foot in the message he says they have to be separated we cannot stand the risk anymore like Eve stood in the risk which fruit am I going to eat and when she took the fruit because the branches were intertwin she was CAU in a Trap God says this time I'm going to separate them Hallelujah to such an extent that the elect cannot be deceived the elect will have that says the Lord and that says the Lord will dominate the life of one elect is that amen my brother amen he says they are now to be separated the fruits of those Vine which at such variance will be gathered in separate ghh amen the two spirits will go to separate destinations now it time the final call that comes to only the wheat Bride come out of her my people that he be not partakers of our SE that he quit you quit receive not their tears amen their plagues and he says the Great Tribulation the separation is now but it's individual that takes that St Revelation 41 are you together with me and after this I looked and behold the door was open in after this I looked after what after Jesus and stood on the door and he says behold I stand at the door open amen go to the verse up 320 Revelation 3:20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man oh God the emphasis of an individual relationship with Christ behold I stand at the door and knock If any man my voice I will come into him and will s with him and he with me we are Gentiles God deals with you as an [Applause] IND so he comes to verse four I mean 4 verse1 he says after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it way of a trumpet talking with me which come up I will show thee things which must be Hereafter so God calls you out of not to come to the knowledge of the godhead but to the revelation of the teaching Christ I will show you because you have got ears to hear are you together with me I will show you so this revelation of Christ is not Doctrine but Christ made manifest to his bride it is a presence I have now separated you I put you into the bridge so that you can enjoy fellowship with the son of man amen we must know that you you know at at this stage the rock the you know he has come and is now uniting himself to the bride body we are faing away from the invisible Union and melting into the visible Union that will bring him down on the he is here right now in an invisible Union but fully identified with his fruit with this bride by a fruitful life the word flesh made flesh in Christ blessing the bride listen in future home see you were made for an eternal [Applause] purpose because are the manifestation of the attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you and he made an ask to take you out of amen and make you a human being amen you were made for an eternal purpose you are the manifestation of the attribute of God for us to have the fullness of God then we come together that's when we make a church but first of all you must be a manifested attribute with the Revelation revealing the Life of Christ in you amen show a manri of the Eternal God and the other brother reveals is an attribute of the Eternal God then that's when we come together as a Church Fellowship and that is stability because you know who you are and you know what you're here for amen so the rock box today is Christ made manifest in his bra not the letter now but a manifested life your life is God's Divine attribute manifest that's where we are growing to that's why it says from glory to glory we grow in the presence of light that light shows every that you wash it away when you wash one daughter away that's a greater glory the light keeps shining in a certain way and you see another dot here was it away the light is our Wasing that's why we are in Ephesus I mean in in the preach praise God I'll give you a very interesting quote here amen because we have to understand that actually what we are coming to is not the letter the letter has always puffed up the people but that's not what what we are coming to we are coming into presence and in the presence it is humility but where the letter is can you manage me can you manage me should we open the Scrolls God have mercy it's preeminence it is Christ feeling all things Christ becoming the center of our Focus Amen in the monolog brother Bram says let me give you something I see your fields are full of wheat a full of always BS praise the Lord Little Old Spring sticks [Laughter] out and flopping around like it knows everything it got in the head that's the with a lot of these guys that they think they got a whole lot in their head and nothing in their heart will bow to the power recognize Jesus Christ as the son of God believe his works this is where we are it is humility it's presence it is a light a washing light we need the revelation of Jesus Christ and that will make our heads bow in respect of the return of the sea because we shall know that is coming into his F amen it is Harvest time is checking on his wheat checking on his wheat and you know this doesn't happen in winter it comes in great Heat where every seed begins to dry all the life gathers goes into the head hallelujah hallelujah in the presence of great light and the heat of his presence are you together with me this is where we are this is the season this is how God want R himself to us amen am we are in the presence now and the humility that the presence brings must be manifest so listen brother Bram in Third Exodus said we are going to deal with quite a number of qu today church has to do the same thing get out of that group of rejectors over into the promise before Messiah can ever be manifested before them he says you see the life of the Messiah manifested making church ready a bride you love him right on down the edges to the present time of the last day messenger the same life and the same light is manifested by a life that he with Christ in God Amen so down here is the MST of God revealed praise the Lord amen I don't know whether we shall finish this but I think we should are you patient amen the prophet says now you can see now the end time message why it is rejected can you now no denomination but the revelation of his mystery no denomination amen so the emphasis in the end time message is not let us make a great group but let us get individ that will accept Christ that will find their position in the body and when we come together we make the church amen he saids the revelation God is not known by denomination he known by Revelation in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride oh man God made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in the did you hear that the word made flesh Christ in the bride amen so the message is rejected because the emphasis of Revelation today is Christ made manifest in an individual life amen not just building this church against that church this Camp against this campy then these ones here specialize in this philosophy of the message I and Christ becoming one the word made flesh the Gentile Church is built on individual revelation of Christ when we speak of church think of yourself as church that Divine attribute that's made manifest in this season denomination of Minds cannot fit in here it cannot fit in here amen because this seon is Christ in all things listen wonderful quot here God expressed in Jesus Christ who was both Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the godhead B now the complete fullness of the b in his church the preces all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he has poured into the church the believer that's where the individual Ministry begins from when when a man has seen Christ not just Christ the doctrine but Christ made manifest in the life of an individual the foundation matters a lot amen so let's seeit the fin octave here word word made flesh together with me when God says Let There be there will be God is speaking the word to you to make you what he wants you to be his word never fail and once you become a written piece you are become part of the word the word made flesh and God does not change his mind about his word hallelujah he will do everything to help you overcome are you together with me just say Lord I Surrender I come to you just come and live your life in my life you become the world he will not change his mind about you he fight every one of your battles amen amen let's get final octave here in Isaiah 55: and I want you to listen to this very care he says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not come it shall not returnto me void but it will accomplish that which I please and shall prosper in everything I sent it hallelujah hallelujah do you believe the message that's the word of God it will never go back to God void without creating a bride and that bride is you the believer and then he comes here in John 663 and he says it is the spirit that quickness the flesh proest nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirits and they Al life so Lucifer listen chose to deal with the intellectual PR of a man amen that's the devil he deals with int but God CH his heart to the Head Lucifer Minister theology from the same message but to the god Minister life amen Lucifer can pick up the letter amen and use it like he lied to Eve in the Garden of Eden he can give the letter a false application amen but he can as well Minister it exactly but without pointing to the life behind the letter he feels uncomfortable tell the people to come to life he wants you just leave that thing there amen there's no way the devil can ever emphasize life in the word because that life is the life of the blood and the devil wouldn't have nothing to do with the blood are you together with me so Lucifer can Minister the letter but he can never open the CH of life to that letter that's what you want this morning that we may open up the channels of life that the revelation of Christ you have becomes a foundation upon which the church is built and the gates of hell can never Prevail against amen you know the devil can give you the letter to give you a conscious that you are in the word because you can explain the godhead but today we are looking beyond the godhead the life itself the ministry of Christ must reflect his life the words I speak unto you are spirit and life praise God second Corinthians 36 you see so much contented with the letter but not comfortable with the life behind the letter we pray God to have Grace because it will be from glory to glory I don't know you are not I believe that you are not going to remain the same by the time you go out here you'll have stepped on another higher level of God Amen Corinthians 3:6 the holy spirit says who also has made us Ministers of the New Testament hallelujah hallelujah the Old Testament Don't touch don't eat rest Sabbath do this and do that but the new Testament is the life from those ordinances amen that's the New Testament the New Testament is not a period of time a new testament is the life in the blood so what we are doing today is God help us touch the life from under the blood and let that life transform our lives so that we may become Christ revealed in bodies again and the revelation we have you will have the confidence to build your church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against who alsoo made us Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit give life so we are not in the word until you know we know that the word in itself is life the word of God Isaiah says is not void the word of God is life amen it returns manifestation and brings the purpose for which it was sent the word was sent not for me to remain the same way no the word was sent that the spirit the life in the word may give me power of transformation amen okay so the word of God is Not vo Isaiah says so shall my word be that goeth out of my mouth it shall not turn me voice but it shall accomplish it shall fulfill it shall make a way amen praise God this is the word of God so God is not in vain in his words because his word is a spirit and life once he has spoken the word father make me a good ground what that word let it come to life amen so when that word Goes Forth it always creates a body of manifestation around that's true when he says Let There Be then the word was the description but then the word put up a body to produce the purpose for which the word was spoken when he says let there be light then there BR forth a body of light the word will always create a body behind itself the one is always made flesh praise the Lord are you happy this morning is the spirit that Quicken the flesh proth nothing but the words I speak unto you their spirit and life meaning that under the spoken word there is a creative power the words that I speak spirit and life amen so God's word has enough power in it to transform itself into living substance are you written Epistles are you the word of God then there is creative power behind the word to make you Bri [Applause] you know the devil is a liar he always gets your eyes on the impossible it God who says you are my bride you don't have to say but can I can I it's God who says he says you are perfect you are complete and can I can I that's the be positive the word is not only sound but a creative revelation of the father you hear what the prophet says here before a word it is a thought and a thought has to be created so God's thoughts become creation when spoken by the word he said there will be a briad it came from the mind of God with creative power and the bride is you amen he says here and you happy for that day that our God makes every word manest he doesn't speak ID words he told us not do but he speaks every word just exactly so listen friend the word we are ministering this morning to you is the creative revelation of what God wants you to be and brother Bram says there is anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the result it Bears that's the word it always creative it will bring forth fruit amen amen amen you need to to know who you are amen the word must bear fruit it must come alive because it is life in itself amen sir I love him this morning you know the church must have a solid ground to stand without which you be blown by every wind of doct the people will come with anything and they call it word and you say Amen the word became flesh and therefore the word we teach as long as it's Christ it also become flesh in the many member body amen so when this word Goes Forth in this age it must build itself another body and this body is called The Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's what it is the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ so believe the word meditate on it take it ask God to make it life so we go to the scripture we read and then we shall finish right there John 114 the holy spirit says and the Word was made flesh now the word was made there was the action of forming that the word that was Spirit now found a body dwelling the word became flesh in the Lord Jesus Christ so in this drama when he becomes Christ he is the same one God with the same creative power same authority to subdue and to have dominion same God in changing forms and brother Bram called this Anor he used the Greek word meaning a form by which a person or thing strikes division external appearance so the word became flesh it took Anor it took a body to translate the Unseen word and today as you believe the word you are the body that is going to be the translation of the word you are the written EP and the people look at you and they will call you the body of the Lord Jesus Christ made flesh amen so friends here we are we build ourselves in the local church this man that man that woman that woman we come together but why because every one of us is an attribute of the father and we have the Revelation that God puts us in this place because he knows us and he puts us under a [Music] Ministry when I say Ministry and meaning of the other ministers that minister so that God can use this men to help you overcome he [Applause] hides behind the wickedness of the people to make himself known so when you see the weakness when you see the Christ it doesn't mean God is not there just watch when the ministers put the word in the area the lamb will come forth and you'll say Jehovah Gyra God will always Supply amen what's your trouble what's your problem this one says family that one says that another one says another thing this one says sickness but in the right season God will come and V you in the area of your need and God will show himself alive praise the Lord the word made flesh what do you think flesh is praise the Lord yes sir you know the flesh is weak it fails even when God came down into this flesh certain things would happen to him when he visited Abraham he walked fromon he walked from eternity a long journey and then he came down in the ples of memory by the time he came came to Abraham he was visibly hungry he was dirty he was tired but God he behind that and still say in the time of life you shall have a child together with me praise God don't look at where you fail that's where God wants to meet you the family the individual the local church our weakness is where God hide himself and show himself a life praise the Lord God bless you we shall not have it all today but we shall continue building on it it's being a Believer is not just taking ah yes I was baptized yeah and I got such and such a church no it's presenting yourself in the presence of the world that the lightting you what God wants Hallelujah hallelu and as long as the word has formed it brings such a humility like it did with Mary and said Let It Be unto meing to word the word in her became flesh [Applause] amen are you we are you we are you in the Harvest is your head full let the humility of the Holy Spirit create us into what he wants us to Amen to be like Jes everybody to be as we stand up to be [Music] like life J oh yes [Music] take that's true [Music] I be the word was made flesh Amen in the Lord Jesus Christ and the same word is made flesh in the body of the Bride now the fullness of the godhead body is in the bride and every one of us if we are part of the world every one of us therefore is the verse in this Rich word hallelujah hallelujah that's why Paul says let Christ dwell in you amen all richness oh praise the Lord amen if we are part of him then we attributes that are put on flesh and God in this time is separating us from the tears to bring us into his eternal life oh sh light revealing your problems your mistakes failur so that you may wash in the presence of the world that when Jesus comes there will be no spto R yes sir you are the word made flesh as the Bride of the
