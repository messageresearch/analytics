[14:30] 37 and read about uh
[14:35] Joseph
[14:37] amen chapter
[14:39] 37 and we shall pick it from verse
[14:44] 12 amen
[14:48] amen it
[14:50] saysand and his Brethren went to feed
[14:53] their father's flock in sheim
[15:01] and Israel said unto Joseph do not do
[15:06] not thy Brethren feed the flock in sheim
[15:08] come and I'll send thee unto them and he
[15:12] said to him here am
[15:26] I and he said to him go I pray the see
[15:29] whether it be well with thy Brethren and
[15:32] well with the flocks and bring me word
[15:34] again so he sent him out of the veil of
[15:37] Hebron and he came to shake him
[15:57] [Music]
[15:59] and a certain man found him and behold
[16:02] he was wandering in the field and the
[16:04] man asked him saying
[16:17] what and he said I seek my brethren tell
[16:22] me I pray thee where they feed their
[16:24] flocks
[16:33] and the man said they are departed hence
[16:36] and for I heard them say let us go to to
[16:39] Dothan and Joseph went after his
[16:41] Brethren and found them in Dothan
[17:00] and when they saw him a far off even
[17:02] before he came near unto them they
[17:05] conspired against him to
[17:16] slay and they said one to another behold
[17:18] this dreamer cometh come now therefore
[17:21] and let us slay him and cast him into
[17:23] some pit and wish we will say some evil
[17:27] Beast have divided him and we shall see
[17:30] what will become of his dreams
[18:00] may the Lord add a blessing to his word
[18:02] we may get
[18:07] seen so we are reading about the story
[18:09] here of
[18:11] Joseph and we've all heard about
[18:15] Joseph and his story praise the lord we
[18:20] know that
[18:21] Joseph was one of the children of
[18:24] Israel the children of
[18:27] Jacob and he was a special
[18:31] man he had a special gift from the
[18:34] Lord in other words he had a special
[18:37] favor from the
[18:40] Lord because he had a special
[18:43] favor even his father loved
[18:46] him from his from his
[18:50] childhood he exhibited certain
[18:54] character he was a little bit
[18:57] different so he could have
[18:59] dreams then he could come tell his
[19:01] father about the
[19:03] dreams and each time he did
[19:05] that his brothers were
[19:09] angry they became jealous of
[19:12] him and from where we have picked it
[19:15] from now hisen had gone to look after
[19:20] flock and now his father wanted know
[19:23] about
[19:24] them and how they were doing and how the
[19:27] flock was doing
[19:30] so now as they were down in the
[19:32] bush he comes and now he finds them and
[19:37] the first thing while he was looking for
[19:41] them anly wanting to know how they were
[19:44] doing and he wanted to take information
[19:47] back to the
[19:49] father different with their
[19:52] brothers for them when they saw him it
[19:56] was an opportunity to get rid of him
[20:00] praise the Lord and they said now let us
[20:04] slay him and cast him in some pit and we
[20:08] will say some evil Beast has divide
[20:12] him and we shall see what will become of
[20:15] his
[20:17] dreams they wanted to get rid of the
[20:21] dreams in other words they were trying
[20:23] to
[20:24] fight against the anointing that Joseph
[20:28] had received of the
[20:31] Lord when they got the opportunity to
[20:34] slay him they said let us slay him for
[20:38] they thought that when they get rid of
[20:40] him they would get rid of the plan of
[20:44] God praise the Lord but as we shall see
[20:47] down the road we see that everything
[20:51] that was happening to
[20:53] Joseph was after the patterns of God
[20:58] and the Bible says in verse
[21:01] 21 and Reuben had heard it and delivered
[21:06] him out of their hands and said not kill
[21:13] him Reuben said unto them shed no blood
[21:17] but cast him into this pit that is in
[21:20] the wilderness and lay no hand upon him
[21:23] that he might read him out of their
[21:26] hands to deliver him to his father
[21:48] again and it came to pass when was come
[21:52] into his father into his unto his
[21:55] Brethren that they strip Joseph out of
[21:58] his coat his coat of many colors that
[22:01] was on
[22:16] him and they took him and cast him into
[22:19] a pit and the pit was empty there was no
[22:21] water in it
[22:28] and they sat down to eat bread and they
[22:30] lifted up their eyes and looked and
[22:32] behold a company of
[22:35] ishmaelites came from Gilead with their
[22:38] camels bearings
[22:41] spicy and B and Maya going
[23:14] and Judah said unto his Brethren what
[23:17] profit is it if we slay our brother and
[23:21] conceal his blood come let us sell him
[23:24] to the
[23:25] ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon
[23:29] him for he is our brother and our flesh
[23:32] and his brethren we content
[24:00] and see Joseph was a very calm
[24:03] man and they kept tossing him here and
[24:08] there because of the anointing that he
[24:11] was
[24:13] carrying so now they got a hold of him
[24:17] and they sold him and They Carried him
[24:20] over to
[24:21] Egypt praise the Lord and then they came
[24:24] and deceived their
[24:26] father but now
[24:29] it wasn't over with
[24:32] him even when he reached
[24:36] Egypt he still had to go through another
[24:41] toll praise the Lord when he reached out
[24:45] there and he found himself again the
[24:48] house of
[24:50] pharaoh again Pharaoh's
[24:53] wife bled after him praise the Lord
[24:58] because he was a
[25:01] man praise the Lord was a very faithful
[25:06] man he had learned of his father and he
[25:10] had a special
[25:12] anointing he could not fall at the test
[25:15] that God had laid him before the wife of
[25:20] pharaoh even even when he had passed it
[25:24] praise the Lord Pharaoh's wife assed him
[25:29] which landed him into
[25:31] trouble and he was cast into prison
[25:36] praise the Lord he leaves his
[25:39] father sold by his brothers then he's in
[25:43] a Strange
[25:45] Land
[25:46] accused praise the Lord and he's thrown
[25:49] into
[25:50] prison and then he begins to Ser the
[25:56] sentence praise the Lord we want to see
[25:59] the
[26:00] nature praise the Lord the nature of
[26:03] Joseph and how God dealt with
[26:07] him through all these
[26:10] troubles praise the Lord and for our
[26:13] text this
[26:14] evening we shall be looking at through
[26:17] it
[26:19] all through it
[26:21] all which is a Christian's
[26:25] theme is a Believer song
[26:29] is a believer's
[26:31] theme it is our
[26:33] topic praise the Lord through it
[26:36] all God is always patient with his
[26:41] plan God is always patient with his
[26:45] people and through it all he remains God
[26:51] so now we see that this man
[26:53] Joseph after he thrown there and he
[26:57] serving the
[27:00] anointing of the Lord was still with
[27:03] him but the prophet says at some
[27:08] point God allows
[27:11] us to feel the
[27:14] weight praise the Lord he allows us to
[27:18] feel some
[27:19] weight no wonder the song writer
[27:22] says must Jesus bear the cross alone
[27:28] praise the Lord even when we are bearing
[27:30] the
[27:32] cross God is still patient with us and
[27:36] is still faithful to his
[27:38] promises that through it all he comes to
[27:42] our
[27:43] refuge praise the Lord Joseph is
[27:46] thr and he's
[27:49] suffering and now at some
[27:52] point people
[27:54] dream one of his inates dream
[27:58] some of two prisoners had a dream and
[28:02] they were confused of the
[28:04] dream then because
[28:06] J God had chosen
[28:09] Joseph and Joseph was a special man with
[28:13] a special
[28:14] [Applause]
[28:15] anointing no matter where they had
[28:17] thrown
[28:18] him the anointing of God never left
[28:22] him God still walked with him through
[28:26] the pit walked with him when was selling
[28:30] him he walked with him when they when he
[28:33] went to Pharaoh's house even when he was
[28:36] accused God saw him and God could not
[28:40] protect him at that
[28:42] point because God had a purpose for
[28:45] Joseph
[28:46] life praise the Lord all that God could
[28:49] do was preserve Joseph through it
[28:52] all such that the plan of
[28:55] God must come to pass
[28:58] praise the Lord so now he's in
[29:00] prison and two inates
[29:03] dream and now because God is with him
[29:07] praise the Lord he tells him of the
[29:10] interpretation of the dream then he
[29:13] interprets and one of them praise the
[29:16] Lord is
[29:19] freed and Joseph is left he continues to
[29:23] serve praise the Lord but it was the
[29:26] purpose of God
[29:28] these two
[29:29] inates have a dream and they are freed
[29:34] such that it is the two
[29:36] inmates one of them had to carry the
[29:40] testimony about the work that God was
[29:43] doing in
[29:44] Joseph through to
[29:47] Pharaoh praise the Lord so Joseph is
[29:50] there
[29:52] suffering in prison then on the other
[29:55] hand God visits him once again
[29:59] and now Pharaoh gets a
[30:01] dream and Confused of what it
[30:05] is but because God had planted one of
[30:09] these praise the Lord he carried the
[30:12] testimony over to
[30:14] pharaoh and now when Pharaoh heard about
[30:16] the existing of
[30:18] Joseph regardless of whether Joseph had
[30:22] committed a sin that the wife accused
[30:25] him
[30:28] or not and Pharaoh was being furious
[30:32] with
[30:34] Joseph because of this that had
[30:36] happened he needed to know what the
[30:39] dream was all
[30:40] about and he only to be
[30:44] Joseph to give him the
[30:47] interpretation that was the purpose of
[30:49] God he caused him to have the
[30:52] dream that that Joseph could not it was
[30:56] time for him to be pulled out of
[30:59] prison it was now the plan of
[31:02] God Joseph lears
[31:06] patience he's taken to prison and he's
[31:10] patient yes he can dream and he can make
[31:14] interpret but he was he wasn't proud
[31:17] about
[31:18] it he couldn't go on telling people
[31:21] about the dreams and interpretations
[31:22] there
[31:23] are he often waited upon the Lord and
[31:28] now when he waited on the
[31:30] Lord Pharaoh has a
[31:32] dream and he needs a
[31:35] Joseph to come and give the
[31:37] interpretation so they have to ask
[31:39] Joseph out of
[31:42] prison come and give the
[31:44] interpretation praise the Lord And now
[31:47] when Pharaoh listens and is
[31:50] convinced Joseph from prison the grace
[31:55] of God lifts him
[31:56] up and he became the Prime
[32:00] Minister next to Pharaoh the one who was
[32:04] in charge of over all the
[32:08] stores praise the Lord but that wasn't
[32:11] the plan of
[32:12] God ends there God had a special
[32:17] purpose a special
[32:19] plan why Joseph had to suffer at the
[32:23] hands of his
[32:25] brothers thrown and sold
[32:29] accused and
[32:32] imprisoned now he is the
[32:34] primer of the entire
[32:37] country that wasn't
[32:40] enough God was trying to preserve his
[32:44] own
[32:46] seed God had seen what would be the
[32:51] land what was going to before the land
[32:55] and he noticed that Israel
[32:58] and his children could not
[33:01] survive praise the Lord the drought and
[33:04] the famine that was going to
[33:07] come so now when the brothers
[33:10] thought that were doing Mischief against
[33:13] against
[33:15] Joseph God was
[33:18] watching and it was the plan of
[33:21] God preserves Joseph's
[33:24] life until he becomes Prim
[33:27] God could not allow Joseph to remain the
[33:30] house of of
[33:32] pharaoh when he was not yet
[33:35] rained when he was not yet
[33:38] ready God had got rid of
[33:41] him God allowed
[33:44] Joseph to feel the weight of
[33:48] trou to feel the weight of
[33:51] persecution but yet God had a plan for
[33:56] Joseph praise
[33:58] and now when Israel heard of the
[34:02] news that his son had been killed and
[34:06] the Animals had
[34:08] divided he cried he became so sorrowful
[34:12] and
[34:13] sad God watched over him praise the Lord
[34:18] remember Israel had come into continents
[34:21] with
[34:23] God and he knew God God knew him but God
[34:28] could not show him the
[34:31] vision that his son was still
[34:35] alive God still concealed the
[34:41] inspiration until the right
[34:44] time praise the Lord so now sometimes
[34:48] the prophet says God conceals
[34:52] it God conceals this inspiration
[34:57] best of the weight of the
[35:00] situation to prepare and preserve
[35:04] us for the best that God has planned and
[35:07] prepared for
[35:10] us he allowed Joseph to go through
[35:13] it and at end of the
[35:16] day God brought him
[35:19] up and elevated him to a
[35:22] position and the Bible says in Romans 5
[35:26] ver1 justified by faith we have peace
[35:30] with God through our Lord Jesus
[35:36] Christ by whom also we have access by
[35:39] faith into his grace wherein we stand
[35:43] and rejoice in the hope of the glory of
[35:46] God
[36:09] praise the name of the Living God so now
[36:12] as
[36:13] Believers as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[36:17] the Bible has said we have access into
[36:20] his
[36:23] grace by
[36:26] faith now through through it all through
[36:29] all the TRS that God could allow our
[36:34] way the element of
[36:38] faith that drives us and we GL into the
[36:42] grace of
[36:43] God to preserve and protect
[36:47] us and to make us stand the test of
[36:52] time and rejoice in Hope of the glory of
[36:55] God
[36:58] not only
[36:59] so but we glory in
[37:04] tribulations knowing that tribulation
[37:06] Works
[37:09] patience patience
[37:14] experience and experience
[37:20] hope so now we notice that that
[37:24] Joseph had patience
[37:27] when his brother
[37:29] thrown when they threw him he didn't
[37:31] fight
[37:32] back he was patient with
[37:35] them why because he had had the
[37:38] dreams and he had seen his dreams come
[37:41] to pass so he knew that there was a
[37:45] God who gave him his these dreams and
[37:49] gave him the
[37:50] interpretation this God would not allow
[37:54] him to die could not allow him to be
[37:57] destroyed
[37:58] so he had that
[38:00] patience he he had the
[38:03] faith to go through whatever life he was
[38:06] going through knowing that God was
[38:09] present with
[38:10] him praise the Lord when they choed him
[38:14] of of a wanting Pharaoh's
[38:18] wife he he he he not defend himself
[38:23] enough it was a test that was brought
[38:25] before him
[38:27] it is a weight that he had to
[38:29] carry for that which God had planned for
[38:32] him
[38:33] ahead praise the Lord and the prophet
[38:36] says in the message God has pro has a
[38:39] provided
[38:40] way
[38:42] 1956 and that's the way it is
[38:45] today God has made a way to destroy that
[38:50] cancer God has made a way to take the
[38:52] blindness out of them
[38:55] eyes God has made a way
[38:58] that are we God has made a way and what
[39:02] are we trying to do with with this
[39:08] word build something for you to write
[39:10] through
[39:12] on your
[39:14] Victory God's word thus says the Lord
[39:19] see thus says the
[39:23] Lord read through on his word
[39:28] God said so after a while when God got
[39:32] ready for it to
[39:34] happen when was speaking about the
[39:37] rains says the rain was up
[39:40] there praise the Lord and says all right
[39:43] he did the same
[39:45] thing he was going to glorify himself in
[39:48] the Hebrew
[39:49] children speaking about the Hebrew
[39:52] children praise the Lord these were
[39:55] God's children
[39:57] we have often spoken about the Hebrew
[40:00] children there are a special
[40:02] encouragement to us in moments of
[40:05] trouble these
[40:07] children praise the Lord they are very
[40:10] faithful with
[40:12] God praise the Lord and the prophet says
[40:16] they did not have any promises written
[40:18] down for them to
[40:21] read that they could read and say God
[40:23] you promised
[40:25] this praise the Lord but they moved
[40:29] through it all by
[40:32] faith praise the Lord he says they
[40:35] didn't have any
[40:36] promise they couldn't get back there and
[40:38] read in the Bible and say Lord you
[40:40] promise in your
[40:43] word of your children ever went into a
[40:46] fair
[40:47] furnace you deliver them all right we
[40:52] are coming right there
[40:54] down well that wouldn't have been so
[40:58] hard just their faith because God had
[41:02] already promised
[41:03] it but God had not promise them
[41:07] so but here is the words they
[41:11] heard God was so real to
[41:14] them they said our God is
[41:17] able praise the Lord now God was
[41:20] watching over those
[41:22] children he was watching over the
[41:25] situation he was watching over the
[41:28] and because God knew that these were
[41:31] faithful
[41:33] children he wouldn't allow them to go
[41:35] through the
[41:36] furnace you would have done something to
[41:38] stop them from going
[41:40] there you even come down and he could
[41:44] pour maybe water upon the
[41:47] furnace to make it cool and run and fire
[41:50] runs
[41:52] out but God didn't do that he was
[41:56] watching over them
[41:58] he was watching over the situation he
[42:00] was allowing them to feel the weight of
[42:04] the
[42:05] situation such that they could
[42:08] learn patience with God prise the Lord
[42:12] they knew that God would deliver
[42:15] them because they knew that God would do
[42:18] it but even when they reached the door
[42:21] of the
[42:22] Furnace they still saw that the fire was
[42:25] still burning
[42:27] yet God was watching them enter the
[42:30] furnace praise the Lord it does not mean
[42:33] that God had deserted
[42:35] them but God had a plan for that he had
[42:40] his special
[42:41] plan praise the Lord because if maybe
[42:44] God had run down the
[42:46] fire the people would not see the hand
[42:49] of the Lord in the
[42:51] fire praise the Lord but he had to allow
[42:55] them to go through the fire enter into
[42:58] the furnace at the end of the day the
[43:02] people would see the hand of the Lord in
[43:04] the
[43:05] fire and now even to M and his
[43:09] friends they had to learn patience with
[43:13] God they knew God delivered them and yet
[43:17] God allowed them to enter in that's why
[43:20] the prophet
[43:21] says God sometimes allows us to feel the
[43:25] weights
[43:28] praise the Lord he allowed Joseph to the
[43:31] we thrown into the pit sold out in the
[43:36] land drawn into
[43:38] prison but it was all the purpose of
[43:42] God whatever life has to do with
[43:46] us as children of God as people that
[43:49] have believed on his
[43:51] word that have gotten a promise we know
[43:55] that whatever life has to bring to
[43:58] us God has not allowed it to
[44:01] come it will never come that if it comes
[44:06] still God has the ability to deliver us
[44:09] out of it now through it all we need to
[44:14] Anchor our faith on his
[44:16] promises praise the Lord he says this
[44:19] did not have the
[44:21] promise but they said our God is
[44:24] able how about that the fail that don't
[44:28] believe in Divine
[44:30] Healing they said our God is able we can
[44:33] find that in Daniel chapter 3 we pick it
[44:36] from 17
[44:38] says if it be
[44:42] so our God whom we
[44:45] serve is able to Deliver Us From The
[44:48] Burning F
[44:50] furnace that's all they
[44:53] had he is able and because he is able
[44:58] if we get in
[44:59] there he will deliver us out of
[45:03] your verse 22 God is able Deliver Us
[45:09] come this very
[45:11] furnace but we will not bow down to your
[45:16] images and when they walk down to the
[45:19] F upon bear she
[45:25] faith that God was
[45:28] able not that he promised but that he
[45:31] was
[45:32] able God sent Christ in the
[45:37] furnace and fire away from
[45:41] them and protected them and brought them
[45:45] out by
[45:48] Saving God is by the saying God is
[45:52] able the Lord that's all they had
[45:57] is able and now for us we have a promise
[46:02] praise the lord we have a promise we
[46:04] have a cloud of
[46:06] witness praise the Lord when we get
[46:09] through situations of
[46:11] life we have the word to refer to we see
[46:16] that the same
[46:17] God M confessed that he was
[46:20] able that same God is able to deliver me
[46:25] out of this situation
[46:27] and he is a faithful God based upon our
[46:30] faith in his
[46:32] promises based upon our faith in his
[46:34] words he is still faithful to deliver us
[46:38] out praise the Lord now you don't come
[46:41] saying God is
[46:43] able you don't have to come to that you
[46:47] promised God you
[46:49] promised you prepared it at
[46:52] Calvary and have come to receive it it's
[46:56] your preparation
[46:58] the prophet says now for us we have the
[47:02] promise so now we have to meet God
[47:05] according to his
[47:06] promises praise the Lord when when when
[47:10] the children of Israel at one time we
[47:13] talked about them in the Sunday
[47:15] School when God wanted destroy
[47:18] them when when Moses had gone to meet
[47:21] God in Mount
[47:23] Si and while he was receiving the
[47:25] Commandments
[47:27] and they were here
[47:28] impatient and now they went on to make a
[47:31] golden
[47:33] cup
[47:35] worship and when God saw it and he was
[47:39] very angry with them and he wanted
[47:41] destroy them and he was determined to
[47:45] destroy them now we see one Moses
[47:49] coming Moses had nothing
[47:52] else to stand on to remind God
[47:57] God from from from destroying his
[48:01] people he stood on the
[48:04] promise God had met with
[48:06] Abraham he stood with the promise that
[48:09] God had met with
[48:11] Israel out of them he would make a great
[48:14] nation and when he reminded
[48:17] God out you said you promise you
[48:22] promised Abraham that out of him will
[48:25] come a great nation
[48:27] if he destroy his
[48:29] people where shall that Nation come from
[48:33] and when God looked at his
[48:35] promise he it repented
[48:38] God and God repented and he never
[48:42] destroyed them and now to us Believers
[48:45] we have the promises in the word and we
[48:48] are sure that the promises of
[48:51] God yes and
[48:53] amen God promises and he fulfills
[48:58] praise the Lord even if he has not
[49:00] fulfilled anything in your
[49:02] life you have about him he made a
[49:06] promise when he sent the
[49:08] angel the Angel and the angel came down
[49:11] and said
[49:12] Mary you shall
[49:16] conceive without knowing a man you shall
[49:20] conceive and we see that it came to pass
[49:23] Andy
[49:25] conceived prises the Bible we see Father
[49:29] Abraham God promised that you have a
[49:33] child even if you've not seen another
[49:36] person having a child at least you have
[49:40] read and you believe that God promise
[49:43] Abraham him a child that's why the
[49:46] prophet says here praise the Lord that
[49:49] you should stand on the Promises of
[49:52] God the Lord when you going through it
[49:55] all
[49:56] promise you remind God that you made a
[50:00] promise and I have
[50:03] faith in your promises and God is
[50:07] faithful and you'll get us through and
[50:10] he says you'll go away a different
[50:14] person when you meet God at his
[50:17] promises and you have faith in his
[50:20] promises you go away a different
[50:23] person you go away with SE an anchor
[50:26] inside your
[50:28] soul that nothing can upset
[50:31] you you know that you are
[50:34] healed when you're sick you know that
[50:37] you are healed because it is in the
[50:39] promises of God he promised that he will
[50:43] heal all our
[50:44] diseases not some but all our diseases
[50:48] so now what is that
[50:50] disease that is too big before the eyes
[50:52] of the Lord that is so big before the
[50:55] Lord
[50:57] praise the Lord now you meet God at his
[51:00] promise and you remind him of your
[51:03] healing he gives you your healing bu
[51:06] upon your Fai say you know that God has
[51:09] taken care of of this matter for
[51:12] you because he has promised he gives
[51:16] testings and
[51:19] trials with these promises many times he
[51:23] let the Hebrew children feel the weights
[51:28] Fire coming upon
[51:30] them but yet he could not allow them to
[51:32] be
[51:34] burned we may carry a
[51:36] weight it could be a weight of a
[51:39] disease it could be a weight of some
[51:42] kind of
[51:43] trouble be weight of a spiritual
[51:46] condition and somehow God could allow
[51:49] you to feel that
[51:51] weight the same God is watching over
[51:54] you and the same God still
[51:58] faithful to take you through it
[52:00] all praise the Lord you may carry it and
[52:05] sometimes we become
[52:08] impatient and we begin to complain to
[52:12] God praise the lord it's not
[52:15] news praise the Lord job he was a
[52:19] faithful man a very perfect man the most
[52:23] perfect on the face of the Earth
[52:26] God was confident about
[52:29] him but yet God allowed the devil when
[52:34] Satan wanted to prove
[52:37] himself that he would come and play
[52:39] around with job's
[52:42] life God allowed it he said I am very
[52:47] confident about my
[52:49] child there is nothing you can do about
[52:53] him because he has received of my life
[52:58] job had the life of God
[53:00] in so he was a faithful
[53:03] man job was a prophet praise the Lord
[53:07] and now we notice what God
[53:09] did God concealed this vision from
[53:13] job and allowed job to test the
[53:17] weight allowed him to feel the
[53:20] weight and when Satan came and struck
[53:25] God job's children
[53:27] God was watching and he was still
[53:30] faithful through
[53:32] it praise the Lord job started
[53:36] crying God was
[53:38] watching Praise the Lord not that God
[53:41] was not feeling the
[53:43] pain but God had a special plan for the
[53:46] life of
[53:48] Job and even when job's
[53:51] flock and his home was
[53:54] destroyed God was watching
[53:57] praise the Lord but God concealed job
[54:02] from seeing this vision and yet job was
[54:07] a prophet who Could See Vision praise
[54:10] the Lord but God had a purpose to prove
[54:14] to the devil that he could not do
[54:17] anything to take away the faith that job
[54:21] had
[54:22] received
[54:24] sometimes sometimes
[54:27] God sees the devil Satan coming around
[54:32] our
[54:33] lives he may play with our
[54:36] health prise the Lord God is seeing he
[54:40] is watching but God is confident of one
[54:43] sure
[54:45] thing the faith that he has given unto
[54:48] you that the devil regardless of these
[54:53] troubles he cannot take away that faith
[54:57] regardless of how hard the devil
[55:00] F he brought cancer
[55:04] and's
[55:06] body and he began
[55:08] roting
[55:10] yet never denounced his faith in
[55:14] God and God was watching he was waiting
[55:18] for the time
[55:20] Appo to prove devil that he couldn't
[55:24] take away the fa
[55:29] some when he felt was becoming so
[55:32] heavy when he was testing of the
[55:35] weight he now began complaining to
[55:38] God and now at that point it is the
[55:42] point that God was
[55:44] waiting himself to come and meet with
[55:47] job praise the Lord this this
[55:51] point God never sends a
[55:55] messenger he will not send another
[55:57] person come and speak to
[55:59] you God himself comes down speaks your
[56:05] heart had now tested the
[56:08] way and God was
[56:11] convinced praise the Lord now God came
[56:14] down he didn't allow job to over
[56:17] complain because he saw that he was a
[56:19] just man and now he came to him and he
[56:23] now started taking away the cover
[56:26] he took off the seal one by one and
[56:30] started reminding him that you job you
[56:33] are a prophet you are able to see these
[56:37] things you you are the Son of God you
[56:41] have received this word you have this
[56:44] promise and these promises are written
[56:46] in the
[56:47] Bible get down to the word began reading
[56:51] for him one by
[56:52] one now job when God had taken off the
[56:57] cover began to
[57:00] see the Lord that's when God asked
[57:04] him where were you when the Sons and
[57:07] Daughters of God for
[57:10] joy and now when he heard that voice God
[57:15] had taken off the
[57:16] cover he got into the vision and he saw
[57:20] himself there and he saw himself even if
[57:24] he was
[57:25] roting see his skin dropping but saw a
[57:29] young
[57:30] job why because God had taken off the
[57:34] cover job entered into the
[57:37] expression and he was able to see the
[57:40] plan of
[57:41] God
[57:43] noticed suffering that was going through
[57:47] was but for a moment but there after
[57:50] there is a body that is awaiting him and
[57:53] then when he saw it now God remind
[57:57] that you are not to suffer this has been
[58:00] for a moment you are a special person
[58:03] you are my child and I have made you you
[58:07] are my own you've gone through this
[58:09] situation children have died you come so
[58:13] poor you lost your job you lost your
[58:18] reputation but yet you are job you are
[58:22] my son I have not you I have left you
[58:27] just get down to the word and see your
[58:30] name and see your
[58:32] promises and see that the promises of
[58:34] God are sure and
[58:37] amen and now when we come to that
[58:40] point God steps in he steps in Praise
[58:45] the Lord and the anointing come through
[58:49] praise the Lord now he begins to speak
[58:51] to you
[58:53] individually that's the point when you
[58:56] get the bible to read the scripture you
[59:00] get exactly to that point that he
[59:01] speaking about your
[59:03] situation you come you come to
[59:06] fellowship and the pastor is speaking he
[59:09] speaks exactly to your heart
[59:12] condition that is the point when
[59:15] God has had your
[59:17] complaining and now he has come to speak
[59:19] to your
[59:21] heart remind you that you're a special
[59:23] person remind you that you're a special
[59:27] remind that you not
[59:29] die in the situation there that
[59:34] faithful and that he is faithful and he
[59:37] will deliver you through it all but what
[59:40] we learn from all the
[59:41] situations we learn to be faithful to
[59:45] his
[59:46] promises we learn to be faithful to his
[59:50] words we learn to keep our faith
[59:54] anchored on the promise of
[59:57] God God sometimes allows us to feel the
[1:00:03] weight look at Daniel a very faithful
[1:00:07] man Daniel had been
[1:00:09] tested praise the Lord he had been
[1:00:12] tested and at some point Nez was going
[1:00:15] to kill all of
[1:00:17] them and still he tested of the goodness
[1:00:20] of the
[1:00:21] Lord and God gave him the dream and
[1:00:23] interation thereof
[1:00:26] and now this was a
[1:00:28] point God was still Wasing over
[1:00:31] Daniel but this point Daniel had to feel
[1:00:35] the
[1:00:36] weight when they conspired against
[1:00:39] him and the King ordered that Daniel be
[1:00:42] thrown into the
[1:00:44] den God Wasing over him Wasing over
[1:00:49] Daniel he saw Daniel
[1:00:52] marching he saw him being tied and he
[1:00:55] saw the animals the Lions being
[1:00:59] stared and they were very
[1:01:01] hungry and anything that was thrown in
[1:01:05] there be smashed and
[1:01:07] crushed God was washing over the
[1:01:10] situation and when he was
[1:01:12] smashing the Landes were
[1:01:15] roaring when they had the vibration of
[1:01:17] people coming
[1:01:18] through they began
[1:01:20] lowering and and now Daniel still Maring
[1:01:26] he was thrown in
[1:01:28] there and he became so
[1:01:31] frightened he had to feel the
[1:01:35] weight the says he saw the animals
[1:01:38] coming with open
[1:01:41] tooths were open ready to grab him
[1:01:46] that's when God sent the
[1:01:48] angel to cover Daniel and protected him
[1:01:52] from the
[1:01:53] Lions situations
[1:01:56] will come even families things will get
[1:02:00] bad for a Believer because that's what
[1:02:04] Satan is looking for to distort your
[1:02:08] life to make you miserable to make you
[1:02:11] worried all the
[1:02:13] time that you lose your
[1:02:16] concentration you lose your
[1:02:18] faith Daniel even when he was thrown in
[1:02:22] there he knew that God would still
[1:02:26] him he had his
[1:02:29] Fai on God because God had done it for
[1:02:33] him
[1:02:33] before and he was still faithful to help
[1:02:37] him so many times we have heard people

[1:06:43] but it had to take
[1:06:45] patience it had to take their
[1:06:48] faith praise the Lord even if you have a
[1:06:51] small Faith left
[1:06:56] hang on that
[1:06:57] Faith praise the Lord even if you have a
[1:07:00] very small
[1:07:03] Faith raise up on that
[1:07:06] Fai and pray and wait on the Lord he
[1:07:10] shall stand upon that little
[1:07:12] face lift you up to

[1:07:47] keep our
[1:07:48] faith the road may seem to be so rough
[1:07:52] but let us keep our Fai I take few
[1:07:55] quotes here he says the prophet says the
[1:07:59] message I have heard but now I
[1:08:02] see so then as soon as you get these
[1:08:06] places you know that it's been revealed
[1:08:09] to you by the word of
[1:08:12] God
[1:08:14] Revelation by the word that God requires
[1:08:16] you to
[1:08:18] do then you have
[1:08:20] faith now just like Abraham when he was
[1:08:24] 99 years old
[1:08:28] I
[1:08:29] believe appear this
[1:08:32] old now 9 years
[1:08:36] old when he was almost 100 years
[1:08:40] old that God had been waiting upon that
[1:08:45] promise that that had been waiting upon
[1:08:48] that promise all these
[1:08:50] years appear to him the name of el
[1:08:53] Shai he appeared to him in the name of
[1:08:58] el
[1:09:00] shed God and what an encouragement it
[1:09:04] was yet the promise wasn't fulfilled
[1:09:08] then Abra but
[1:09:11] Abraham I am the almighty
[1:09:15] God the strength Giver the breasted God
[1:09:20] he was waiting he had become so old and
[1:09:24] God visited him
[1:09:26] the name
[1:09:27] El the Blessed God the strength Giver he
[1:09:31] shall Vis
[1:09:33] me he shall visit you in that time as El
[1:09:39] the breasted God the strength giver and
[1:09:42] when your strength is run
[1:09:44] out he shall give you the strength to
[1:09:48] rise up because at the end of the day
[1:09:51] each of us must have the strength
[1:09:55] of us must have the
[1:09:57] anointing each of us must have that
[1:10:01] fire each of us must have the power to
[1:10:05] get into the Rapture so even when your
[1:10:08] faith is running
[1:10:10] low hold on to the promises of God hold
[1:10:15] on to the word of God for he promised
[1:10:19] that he's coming for a church he's
[1:10:21] coming for the brides and you will be
[1:10:24] sure
[1:10:25] that he is coming for
[1:10:28] me praise the Lord hold onto that Faith
[1:10:31] he
[1:10:32] says like I've told you
[1:10:34] before like the little baby that is
[1:10:37] Fring and sick and
[1:10:40] crying lays upon his mother's
[1:10:43] breast and nures his
[1:10:46] strength back from her because it is
[1:10:49] satisfied where it is
[1:10:53] ning because the only access has a knows
[1:10:56] of it of of his his mother's
[1:11:00] breast he knows no other do of
[1:11:03] medicine you might give him a dose of
[1:11:06] medicine he would SC and
[1:11:10] cry give him a shot in the
[1:11:13] arm and he would carry on but the only
[1:11:16] access to satisfy him is the mother's
[1:11:20] bre said Abraham you are old your
[1:11:24] strength is gone
[1:11:26] your arms are withed
[1:11:29] up but I am your
[1:11:32] mother just take a hold of my
[1:11:36] promise and be satisfied while you are
[1:11:42] waiting he says I am your
[1:11:45] strength he spoke to Abraham and says
[1:11:49] Abraham it's me who gave you the
[1:11:52] promise and I am your strength in your
