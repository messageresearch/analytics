[48:28] really seeing it a special
[48:30] privilege to stand before you and
[48:34] Daughters of
[48:35] God especially the pastor of this
[48:39] church I knew him when I was a very
[48:41] young
[48:43] boy just a believer in the
[48:46] church and he used to come to C where I
[48:50] was
[48:51] working and I would attend his
[48:55] meetings sometimes he could bring as
[48:58] visitors and we would really enjoy their
[49:01] fellowships so for me I knew him many
[49:04] years
[49:05] ago early
[49:07] 90s but for him to know
[49:10] me saw some good years but that is when
[49:15] I was in the
[49:16] ministry he Le there is a Ministry
[49:20] inana where God sent
[49:23] me so there again we joined together
[49:27] but for me I'd known him
[49:30] before I'm very much
[49:32] privileged last Sunday
[49:36] but I was also in Pastor James
[49:45] Church where I used to
[49:49] meet I was still a young
[49:51] boy and for the first time also he gave
[49:55] me an opportunity to minister to the
[49:59] church good enough most of his church
[50:03] members they remember my young my my
[50:06] early
[50:09] days so I had very good time with
[50:12] them and they were aware that I'm coming
[50:16] here I can say they also sent their
[50:21] greetings yeah online we have been
[50:24] following your the musicians
[50:29] singers I can just plainly and sincerely
[50:34] say you are the blessing to the body of

[1:07:31] story what happened this
[1:07:34] day I see people very
[1:07:38] hungry hungering for the word of
[1:07:41] God they were blessing one
[1:07:44] another wanting to hear the word of God
[1:07:48] and Jesus called their
[1:07:50] spirit and he had to give them what they

[1:08:17] Simon that the
[1:08:20] deep and let down your nets for a
[1:08:23] drought
[1:08:25] morning I'm sharing something very
[1:08:27] little the title is out into the
[1:08:33] deep there is a voice telling you and
[1:08:36] me that my brother my
[1:08:39] sister don't give
[1:08:41] up justun out a little
[1:08:44] deep you receive your
[1:08:49] cat blessed be the there is a voice
[1:08:52] telling you this morning that out into
[1:08:55] the
[1:08:56] deep for your
[1:09:01] C
[1:09:03] bless I repeat it there is someone
[1:09:06] telling
[1:09:07] you that out a little
[1:09:11] deep for you are
[1:09:14] C blessed be the of the Lord when he
[1:09:16] said that here the words of the Apostle
[1:09:21] Peter and said master
[1:09:25] told all the
[1:09:28] night my brother my sister I don't know
[1:09:31] what you are passing
[1:09:33] through I hope you are well
[1:09:36] taught that there is never been a
[1:09:39] pastor when is there in the office then
[1:09:43] the pastor tells him brother I'm
[1:09:45] inviting you you come and preach to my
[1:09:48] people tell them about this tell them
[1:09:52] about this they have this habit they
[1:09:54] have this
[1:09:56] it's not that visiting Pastor to to tell
[1:09:59] them about
[1:10:04] their not his
[1:10:06] responsibility to come and tell those
[1:10:09] habits but is the RO to take it out so
[1:10:13] sometimes it has happened in my church a
[1:10:16] pastor can stand and
[1:10:18] speak speaks things which are exactly in
[1:10:21] the
[1:10:22] church like the cases you have been
[1:10:27] when he has never heard of them then you
[1:10:30] find someone who
[1:10:31] is says the pastor has told
[1:10:35] him some pastors even call out
[1:10:38] names V just calls you gives you as a
[1:10:42] reference where is not him but the Lord
[1:10:44] speaking to and then you get
[1:10:47] annoyed you say Pastor has told
[1:10:50] him never never never it's never blessed
[1:10:54] be the name of the Lord so here we

[2:00:38] Jews and they tied
[2:00:40] him with

[2:02:03] grave put a strong
[2:02:05] Stone and they commanded command

[2:10:47] everying out the de
[2:10:52] hallelujah hallelujah Ephesians
[2:10:57] 3 I'm still
[2:11:06] myse
[2:11:08] verse 3
[2:11:12] ver
[2:11:13] Ephesians he
[2:11:15] says may be may be able to comprehend
[2:11:19] with all things with all s what is the
[2:11:23] breadth and length and depth and
[2:11:50] height know the love of Christ which
[2:11:53] passes knowledge that you might be
[2:11:56] filled with all the fullness of
[2:12:09] God hallelujah hallelujah verse now him

[2:12:16] above all that we ask of we ask or think

[2:12:42] 21 be in the church by Christ Jesus
[2:12:45] throughout all ages World Without End
[2:12:48] Amen
[2:12:57] hallelujah hallelujah all me to conclude
[2:12:59] with the words of a prophet
[2:13:01] here how is cautioning us how to go
[2:13:04] deeper depths in the
[2:13:07] Jesus he spoke this in the message in
[2:13:10] the church age
[2:13:14] book Church
[2:13:16] age thean Church age
[2:13:23] then he says these words I'm just heing
[2:13:26] now uh he says they have not known depth
[2:13:30] of
[2:13:32] Saturn they have not known the depth of
[2:13:36] Saturn it seems that this verse is
[2:13:39] quoting this very
[2:13:41] scripture that seems that this verse has
[2:13:43] been left out by the
[2:13:46] commentators they were not able to
[2:13:48] figure out what Doctrine
[2:13:52] what
[2:13:53] experiences are meant by this
[2:13:55] phrase Prophet says
[2:13:58] actually it is simple to
[2:14:00] know what is meant let us first know
[2:14:06] what the depth of God
[2:14:08] is and the opposite will be true for the
[2:14:11] dep of
[2:14:14] Satan so which means if you are not in
[2:14:18] the depth of God
[2:14:21] not deep if you don't want to launch
[2:14:23] deeper in the Lord Jesus
[2:14:25] Christ you are launching deeper in
[2:14:29] sat and Satan is
[2:14:32] toed so my brother my sister let us
[2:14:36] deeper into the Lord
[2:14:38] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah yeah I'm
[2:14:41] told today we have a second
[2:14:46] service uh where we shall have the
[2:14:48] communion
[2:14:51] be the name of the is that it still so
[2:14:55] that is still so and also
[2:15:00] everywhere we don't force people to take
[2:15:02] the
[2:15:06] supper hallelujah hallelujah oh
[2:15:09] communion it is your
[2:15:12] choice and I
[2:15:14] know like
[2:15:16] everywhere there will be people
[2:15:19] going not taking the road
[2:15:23] before you
[2:15:24] go I'm talking to that person could be a
[2:15:28] visitor
[2:15:29] here just on my
[2:15:31] behalf I was I I'm
[2:15:34] requesting all of you to be there I say
[2:15:38] even if you are not to take
[2:15:40] it at least join us in that
[2:15:43] service be with us in that
[2:15:46] service blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:15:49] be with us it's like when we are
[2:15:52] baptizing and it's good everyone has to
[2:15:55] participate
[2:15:58] watch blessed be the name of the Lord so
[2:16:00] I'm also
[2:16:01] asking at least everyone to be
[2:16:04] there so why there are things we remind
[2:16:10] ourselves which are very
[2:16:12] important to all of us as
[2:16:17] Christians blessed be the name of very
[2:16:19] important
[2:16:21] to all of us as
[2:16:24] Christians blessed be the of Lord
[2:16:27] because there are three there are three
[2:16:32] important
[2:16:35] ordinances which our Lord Jesus
[2:16:39] Christ commands us to
[2:16:42] do in the
[2:16:45] flesh blessed be the name of the Lord if
[2:16:48] we are
[2:16:49] Christians I want you to hear those few
[2:16:52] words which I'm trying to say that those
[2:16:56] ordinances we are
[2:16:58] commanded to do them in the flesh so
[2:17:03] that's why I would urge at everyone to
[2:17:06] be there and at least we remind
[2:17:09] ourselves of those things blessed be the
[2:17:12] name of the Lord
[2:17:14] because for the sake of those who are
[2:17:17] going some could be our visitors as I
[2:17:20] said
[2:17:22] and some could just be
[2:17:24] going listen to these words just I want
[2:17:27] to throw to you these few
[2:17:30] words the prophet
[2:17:32] says now we only have three physical
[2:17:36] Divine orders left to
[2:17:43] us one of them is
[2:17:47] communion another one is Fe
[2:17:49] washing another one is water
[2:17:53] baptism let me pause a little bit if you
[2:17:57] were
[2:17:58] baptized because we know very well that
[2:18:02] baptism is only
[2:18:04] one there is only and only one
[2:18:08] BM which must be in
[2:18:11] mansion in much water and in the name of
[2:18:15] our Lord Jesus

[2:18:21] for what after that you receive the Holy
[2:18:24] Ghost you receive you connect with the
[2:18:29] Lord connection with

[2:19:24] baptized you you heard the message about
[2:19:28] baptism and you received it
[2:19:31] grad and you embrace the message of the

[2:19:47] aity blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:19:51] hey they
[2:19:52] say if you take it when your life is not
[2:19:56] right you eating for yourself

[2:20:20] right with
[2:20:21] God right here to receive you back and
[2:20:25] you take communion with your
[2:20:27] people
[2:20:29] blessed this is a very important
[2:20:33] event in the life of a
[2:20:36] Christian and you should thank your
[2:20:39] pastor because he puts that provision
[2:20:41] for
[2:20:42] you he fulfills everything the word
[2:20:47] requires hallelujah hallelujah
[2:20:52] your when you always miss
[2:20:59] theer hallelujah
[2:21:02] hallelujah some may not like this but
[2:21:04] let me
[2:21:05] continue he says that's the only three
[2:21:10] things that is the
[2:21:13] Perfection hallelujah hallelujah which
[2:21:16] means these things take us into
[2:21:19] perfection
[2:21:22] how many believe
[2:21:24] that hallelujah hallelujah because these
[2:21:27] are the ordinances of our Lord Jesus
[2:21:31] Christ he left them for us to
[2:21:36] do
[2:21:38] communion
[2:21:40] waterm
[2:21:43] and blessed be the name of the
[2:21:46] Lord very very important
[2:21:50] for my your
[2:21:57] Perfection these are not my
[2:21:59] words hallelujah hallelujah of the three
[2:22:03] those three bring us take us
[2:22:06] Perfection and that's the only three
[2:22:08] orders we
[2:22:10] have we realize that that was the issue
[2:22:14] given by St
[2:22:16] Paul in the New Testament
[2:22:20] if we would
[2:22:22] say the communion should just be take
[2:22:25] the communion should just be taking the
[2:22:31] word you just say I have eaten yes my
[2:22:35] brother s even here we have already
[2:22:39] communed we have enjoyed the word you
[2:22:42] have been feeding on the word that is
[2:22:45] communion real
[2:22:47] communion blessed be the but you must
[2:22:52] also do this of bread and
[2:22:59] wine
[2:23:01] Hallelujah he says if you just take it
[2:23:04] for
[2:23:05] granted that's only the word I hear is
[2:23:09] enough listen listen my brother I want
[2:23:13] to leave these words to those who are
[2:23:15] going
[2:23:18] away they gave a prover
[2:23:21] there's a proverb which
[2:23:26] says I not bring it
[2:23:29] well let me I don't believe
[2:23:32] anyone has a right to take the Lord
[2:23:35] supper until he Hasen the word of the
[2:23:37] Lord into
[2:23:45] his he must be a genuine believer
[2:23:50] the word of God and is ruling in his
[2:23:53] life and has pushed him into
[2:23:56] relationship with
[2:23:58] Christ Hallelujah so the prophet says I
[2:24:01] don't believe of anyone taking theer the
[2:24:04] Lord
[2:24:05] supper he has taken the word of the Lord
[2:24:08] into his
[2:24:10] heart are we together he says
[2:24:14] because I'm
[2:24:17] going says I will read something for you
[2:24:20] in a few moments not then why
[2:24:24] then why we would on the same
[2:24:28] basis 19 says on the same
[2:24:31] basis we could
[2:24:33] absolutely justify the
[2:24:37] Salvation if you can say eating the word
[2:24:41] of God of the preacher that's enough you
[2:24:43] don't to go the
[2:24:45] roer then the prophet says the Salvation
[2:24:49] arm denomination is
[2:24:53] correct in other words you wasted your
[2:24:55] time coming in the
[2:24:56] message have remained
[2:25:02] there the Salvation Army they do not
[2:25:06] believe in any form of water
[2:25:09] baptism listen to this for them they
[2:25:12] don't believe in
[2:25:17] what they don't believe in waterm why
[2:25:21] then why are we
[2:25:23] baptized the water cannot save you the
[2:25:26] blood saves
[2:25:28] you that's how they believe and someh is
[2:25:32] true it's not this water that saves
[2:25:37] you let me continue I will agree with
[2:25:40] that the prophet says I will agree with
[2:25:42] that he says I will agree with
[2:25:48] that that that's right the blood saves
[2:25:52] you not the water not the
[2:25:56] water but we must take the water as an
[2:26:00] outward emotion that an inward work of
[2:26:04] Grace has been
[2:26:12] done blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:26:14] this water is has no power to
[2:26:17] save but this water represents the blood
[2:26:20] of
[2:26:21] Jesus and when you do this
[2:26:24] physically it is an evidence that there
[2:26:26] is something which is done
[2:26:30] in let me give you a testimony we are
[2:26:33] going to the to
[2:26:35] bapti and we are baptizing one
[2:26:38] brother anyone of you can maybe could be
[2:26:41] one who knows

[2:27:01] man even himself still
[2:27:05] testifies he was an officer was really
[2:27:08] very

[2:27:14] immoral he would
[2:27:16] say if in a day we could say I want to
[2:27:20] sleep with five
[2:27:22] women his testimony was no woman could
[2:27:26] refuse
[2:27:30] him which means he had some powers
[2:27:35] of but there is one woman he tried and
[2:27:38] defeated
[2:27:41] him that was my
[2:27:44] wife operating a
[2:27:47] sh he he saw a very beautiful

[2:28:59] now listen to this when we took him for
[2:29:03] water to to be
[2:29:05] baptized I was I don't know God gave me
[2:29:09] wisdom I went in water with another
[2:29:12] Pastor
[2:29:14] Sunday we went there two of us the Lord
[2:29:18] spoke to us we went there
[2:29:21] two brother sister we just dipped the
[2:29:25] brother in
[2:29:27] water in the name of our Lord
[2:29:31] Jesus brother
[2:29:35] became I don't know how many
[2:29:38] times he almost we almost Dred in the
[2:29:42] water we struggled with the
[2:29:45] man then we lifted him and put him in
[2:29:48] the boat
[2:29:50] and put
[2:29:51] aside do you know his testimony he said
[2:29:55] the moment we said I
[2:29:58] said I bapti you in the name of our Lord
[2:30:01] Jesus Christ he said the whole leg
[2:30:04] turned into
[2:30:08] [Music]
[2:30:13] blood saw the water became blood the
[2:30:20] like they said the darkness was
[2:30:22] touchable which was hiding the children
[2:30:25] of Israel from the
[2:30:28] Egyptians or like the stones which were
[2:30:31] bur to ashes which I mean
[2:30:35] on brother saw the water which
[2:30:43] Wasing from that
[2:30:45] day all those demons that were operating
[2:30:49] in him
[2:30:51] they died
[2:30:55] completely hallelujah hallelujah he
[2:30:57] would about
[2:30:59] himself am I the one who can look at
[2:31:02] woman now and I don't admire
[2:31:18] don't that
[2:31:20] di this is what our Prophet is telling
[2:31:23] us my
[2:31:24] brother this baptism we receive this
[2:31:27] very crucial in our
[2:31:30] life so if you received that
[2:31:34] baptism my dear brother
[2:31:37] sister it's the same thing with
[2:31:40] communion very very important in your
[2:31:43] life Jesus Christ said do continue doing
[2:31:46] this in remance of me
[2:31:51] Hallelujah so if you just
[2:31:54] say the sharing of the word is enough
[2:31:56] for me I don't need to go
[2:32:06] communion take these issues very
[2:32:10] serious hallelujah hallelujah do you
[2:32:13] still love
[2:32:15] me hallelujah hallelujah I would proph
[2:32:18] say I would agree with that
[2:32:21] he says that's right the blood saves
[2:32:23] saves you not the water but we must take
[2:32:27] the water as an outward emotion that an
[2:32:31] inward work of
[2:32:33] Grace has been done he says you see so
[2:32:39] must we own
[2:32:43] commun hallelujah hallelujah if you are
[2:32:47] privileged that there's communion
[2:32:50] it's a must for you to take
[2:32:53] it if you understand
[2:32:57] it verse
[2:33:00] 21ag 21 when we have taken the
[2:33:04] road our sacrifice into
[2:33:08] us take into
[2:33:10] you as a matter of spiritual birth into
[2:33:15] us and his
[2:33:17] body we live by
[2:33:20] him we live by his
[2:33:23] word we also should symbolize
[2:33:26] it because a
[2:33:29] commandment repent
[2:33:33] everyone and be baptized in the name of
[2:33:35] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[2:33:39] sins Paul said I have received of the
[2:33:43] Lord that which I also deliver unto
[2:33:46] you that the the same night in the which
[2:33:49] was
[2:33:51] betrayed he took bread and break it and
[2:33:55] gave it to the disciples and say Take
[2:33:59] and
[2:34:00] Eat This do in remance of
[2:34:05] me listen to this for as often as you
[2:34:08] take this
[2:34:10] bread you show forth his
[2:34:14] death he
[2:34:15] comes now we find out that in that
[2:34:21] they had people who
[2:34:23] come the precious Brothers dear brother
[2:34:26] he came and he
[2:34:28] said I never take it brother
[2:34:31] Bram I don't take communion I don't
[2:34:34] understand what it is said I been told
[2:34:37] the other side I said but
[2:34:41] remember will you remember we will admit
[2:34:45] that Paul S Paul
[2:34:50] in the Christian
[2:34:51] church they went from church from house
[2:34:54] to
[2:34:55] house with sing
[2:35:00] of now I say he did it he did put it in
[2:35:05] the
[2:35:07] church and Gans one says if an angel
[2:35:11] from heaven comes and says
[2:35:15] anything
[2:35:17] be you see one that had them to be
[2:35:21] reaped again from the baptism of
[2:35:25] John in the of our Jesus Christ there
[2:35:29] are three things that we must three
[2:35:33] things that we must do as
[2:35:37] symbols the RO
[2:35:40] supper Wasing and water baptism you say
[2:35:45] salvation takes it from The Point
[2:35:48] Salvation it from the
[2:35:52] point they can say the dying Thief when
[2:35:55] he died he was not
[2:35:57] [Music]
[2:36:01] baptized Jesus said he would be in
[2:36:05] heaven that's exactly the truth that's
[2:36:09] exact but you see he only recognized
[2:36:14] Jesus there in the hour he was dying you
[2:36:18] see what I'm saying
[2:36:20] don't refuse
[2:36:22] baptism if you have never been baptized
[2:36:26] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for
[2:36:28] the remission of sins when an
[2:36:31] opportunity is there please use it he
[2:36:34] says this on the on the cross you only
[2:36:38] had his message that
[2:36:40] day for you you have been listening to
[2:36:43] it you been hearing it when you refuse
[2:36:47] it and die
[2:36:49] die a so is the other two the same thing
[2:36:54] with the other
[2:36:56] twoing and
[2:36:58] communion hallelu he says only
[2:37:02] opportunity he had he was aief he was

[2:42:17] deeper and the deeper
[2:42:19] go the S it
[2:42:22] becomes praise the name of our Lord the
[2:42:25] deeper you
[2:42:27] go the more you become like
[2:42:30] God in the message questions and
[2:42:33] answers I think it was of
[2:42:37] 1964 they were asking brother
[2:42:40] Bram actually let me just get
[2:42:44] that praise the name of our Lord in the
[2:42:47] message questions answer of 196
[2:42:50] before they were asking brother
[2:42:53] Bram how can a Christian get deeper in
[2:42:57] the love of
[2:43:01] God and then brother Bram
[2:43:04] answered read the
[2:43:07] word and
[2:43:09] pray read the word of
[2:43:13] God and
[2:43:15] pray praise the name of our Lord the
[2:43:18] same thing which Peter also
[2:43:21] says when you go to the book of
[2:43:25] Acts I think isap
[2:43:29] 6s chapter
[2:43:33] 6 and
[2:43:35] then and then the Bible says in
[2:43:40] verse excuse me Acts chapter 6 and verse
[2:43:44] 4 he says but we will give ourselves
[2:43:49] continually to
[2:43:52] prayer and to the ministry of the
[2:43:56] word praise the name of our Lord and
[2:43:59] these are the sacred trust that God has
[2:44:02] given unto
[2:44:04] us that as you've believed the
[2:44:08] word continue reading the
[2:44:11] word continue meditating upon
[2:44:14] the continue obeying the
[2:44:17] word and continue
[2:44:19] praying you will get deeper and deeper
[2:44:22] in the
[2:44:25] Lord praise the name over and then
[2:44:28] you'll see that all your challenges keep
[2:44:30] on going
[2:44:32] away all those demons keep on going
[2:44:36] away all those bad spirits keep on going
[2:44:38] our
[2:44:39] way all bitterness keeps on going our
[2:44:43] way all any form of thing contrary to
[2:44:48] God completely disappear from your
[2:44:52] life praise the name of our and brother
[2:44:55] has been
[2:44:57] saying you know when we say we are
[2:45:00] believers we are called to be obedient
[2:45:03] to the word of
[2:45:06] God praise the name of our Lord like if
[2:45:08] you talking about the thief on the
[2:45:12] cross when he heard at the last
[2:45:16] moment he obeyed had opportunity to live
[2:45:20] longer than that day he
[2:45:24] died he would have gone into water
[2:45:27] baptism he would have gone into foot
[2:45:30] washing would have gone into
[2:45:33] communion so there is no reason for any
[2:45:36] of
[2:45:37] us who has accepted the Lord Jesus as
[2:45:40] your personal
[2:45:42] savior to avoid foot washing and the
[2:45:46] Lord supper
[2:45:50] otherwise you are playing to be a
[2:45:54] hypocrite praise the name of our Lord
[2:45:56] you're not walking straight with
[2:46:00] God because if you're walking straight
[2:46:02] with
[2:46:04] God challenge in your
[2:46:07] life you seek to rectify there and
[2:46:14] then praise the name of Lord and this is
[2:46:17] the life we have been called this
[2:46:18] morning
[2:46:20] to we need to live a consecrated
[2:46:28] life that should be our continu work as
[2:46:31] children of
[2:46:35] God praise the name of Lord let us sing
[2:46:38] one song Let Us stand up and sing one
[2:46:41] song and then we can each of us
[2:46:44] pray praise the name of our

[2:46:53] fountain
[2:46:55] filled with blood drawn
