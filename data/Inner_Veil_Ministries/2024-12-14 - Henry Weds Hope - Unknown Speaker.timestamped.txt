[50:41] or two minutes to stand
[50:45] up and we read from First Corinthians

[51:14] verses it says but I would have you
[51:18] without
[51:21] carefulness watch those
[51:24] words but I would have you without
[51:30] careful
[51:33] is cares for the things that belong to
[51:36] the
[51:38] Lord how he may please the
[51:43] Lord but he that is
[51:46] married cares for the things that are of
[51:50] the
[51:52] world how he may please his wife
[51:57] there is a difference between a wife and
[51:59] a
[52:02] virgin the unmarried woman cares for the
[52:05] things of the
[52:07] Lord that both in body and in
[52:13] spirit but she that is
[52:17] married cares for the things of the
[52:21] world how she may please her husband
[52:28] and this I speak for your own Prophet
[52:31] not I cast a SN upon you for that which
[52:35] is
[52:36] C that you may attend upon the Lord
[52:39] without
[52:41] destruction If any man think that he
[52:44] behaves himself UNC toward his virgin if
[52:48] she pass the flow of her edge and need
[52:50] so require let him do what he will he
[52:54] sinth not let them marry
[53:02] [Music]
[53:25] may God had blessing the reading
[53:28] we may get SE amen
[53:32] amen so we all come you all in the name
[53:35] of the Lord Jesus
[53:38] Christ and we must be able to uh thank
[53:41] God for Henry and
[53:46] H they are the guests of
[53:50] hon amen amen and the guests of
[53:54] honor I'm told they are never late
[53:58] they are only
[54:01] delayed is that amen so some
[54:03] circumstances have delayed
[54:06] them and it's already
[54:11] 130 so I try my
[54:14] best to make sure that they don't I
[54:16] don't eat much of their
[54:19] time because they have got other guests
[54:23] around amen amen so thank you than you
[54:26] Pastor James
[54:28] katumba for allowing me to come and
[54:31] preside over
[54:33] here amen our Elder understand is in
[54:40] Tania is in the
[54:43] missionary and I'm grateful to Stand
[54:46] Here amen you should congratulate
[54:51] me I was able to I was able to get the
[54:54] color of the of
[54:56] the
[54:59] bride it's not easy because they hide
[55:02] and do
[55:04] whatever I don't know how I
[55:08] was I have made
[55:12] it amen amen so brother Henry and sister
[55:16] hope I'm so grateful I just want to
[55:20] speak
[55:21] something that is quite uh good and I
[55:25] think it should be able to help of
[55:28] us Paul saying I would have you without
[55:40] carefulness so says if you are not
[55:43] married you care for the things that
[55:46] belong to the
[55:48] Lord how you may please
[55:51] God and Paul are saying I would have you
[55:55] so that you don't have that care you
[55:58] don't get away from
[56:00] that because the unmarried person is
[56:03] caring for
[56:05] God but the moment you get married but
[56:09] he that is married he cares for the
[56:13] things of the
[56:15] world how he may please his
[56:18] wife amen and he said there is a a wide
[56:21] difference between a married girl and an
[56:23] unmarried
[56:29] why the
[56:31] unmar is caring about God keeping her
[56:37] body looking for Spiritual things but
[56:40] the married one he
[56:43] cares how he may please her
[56:47] husband the same thing with a man when a
[56:51] man is not married he's caring about
[56:53] things of the Lord but the moment he
[56:56] gets
[56:57] married there is another
[57:00] care that comes upon them and Paul
[57:03] saying I wish you are like
[57:06] me because for him he never married and
[57:09] all his life was caring for
[57:11] God when a man gets married a woman gets
[57:17] married then the
[57:21] care changes and this this afternoon
[57:27] I want to speak about caring to
[57:32] police he says because when you marry
[57:36] you always caring to please your
[57:39] part so the Bible expects us to marry
[57:45] and when we marry we must care to please
[57:49] the people we have got married
[57:52] to is that amen just like the way
[57:56] man who is not married cares to please
[58:01] God but when a man gets
[58:04] married part of
[58:07] the for God is given unto the wife and
[58:12] when a woman is married part of the care
[58:16] which was given
[58:17] unto is is given unto the husband so you
[58:22] have taken a part that was of God and
[58:26] you are giving it to another person you
[58:28] must keep it
[58:31] well so that's why I'm saying caring to
[58:37] pleas because it says they care to
[58:39] please their
[58:43] pattern you have you get a companion of
[58:46] your
[58:49] pleasure when you get married you get a
[58:53] companion of your pleasure
[58:56] and that word
[58:58] pleasure it means a feeling of
[59:02] satisfaction or an
[59:04] enjoyment so the people or the person
[59:07] you got you get married
[59:10] to is a
[59:12] companion of your
[59:14] satisfaction or your
[59:16] enjoyment because while you were serving
[59:19] God there was something which was
[59:22] missing you are like Adam while he was
[59:26] God there was something missing and when
[59:30] God saw it he says it is not good is
[59:34] that amen it's like the woman while she
[59:37] was alone she was safe deep inside of
[59:41] her she was looking for a
[59:44] companion God brings her God brings
[59:49] him to please one
[59:53] another is that amen so marriage starts
[59:58] with
[59:59] choices that are
[1:00:02] pleasing you don't marry a person who
[1:00:04] doesn't please
[1:00:07] you the very
[1:00:09] choice you are
[1:00:12] pleased so the young man the woman girl
[1:00:17] or the
[1:00:18] boy must find
[1:00:21] somebody in whom they are pleased
[1:00:26] to dwell
[1:00:28] with is that
[1:00:30] amen the beginning of it should be
[1:00:34] pleasing amen you know somebody are
[1:00:37] pleased
[1:00:38] with so she must
[1:00:41] be pleasing to you he must be
[1:00:46] pleasing
[1:00:48] your morning we are looking at two
[1:00:51] Pleasant
[1:00:56] amen Henry saw somebody who pleased
[1:01:03] him and hope found somebody who pleased
[1:01:08] her that amen so a part that you get
[1:01:12] married
[1:01:13] to you must be pleased to
[1:01:18] please is that amen somebody you are
[1:01:21] pleased
[1:01:23] with but you are ready to please that
[1:01:28] because the saying that's your
[1:01:31] work is saying the the married person
[1:01:35] must please their wies they must please
[1:01:38] their husband is that amen and so he
[1:01:42] she must be
[1:01:45] pleased to please
[1:01:48] you there are people that you work to
[1:01:53] please and you are pleased
[1:01:56] to please
[1:01:59] them so when we marry we find people
[1:02:02] that are pleased to
[1:02:07] pleas God cares for
[1:02:10] us and the tells us in Jeremiah
[1:02:15] 2911 he has got good
[1:02:18] thoughts thoughts of
[1:02:20] Peace not thoughts of evil to bring us
[1:02:24] to unexpected end
[1:02:28] so God cares for
[1:02:30] us
[1:02:31] amen a prophet preacher said he cares do
[1:02:34] you
[1:02:39] care amen God cares but do you care if
[1:02:44] is
[1:02:45] caring then you must also
[1:02:50] care amen it's a double way if Henry is
[1:02:54] car
[1:02:56] to please hope then hope must also care
[1:03:00] to please
[1:03:01] Henry that's the way things move he
[1:03:05] cares but you
[1:03:07] care amen and when you find
[1:03:10] somebody who is caring to please you you
[1:03:14] must care to please those people is that
[1:03:19] amen if you find a wife or you find a
[1:03:22] husband who is caring to make you
[1:03:25] pleased you must also care make that
[1:03:31] husband if it is the one who
[1:03:34] train it will not
[1:03:39] work is that amen he cares do you
[1:03:44] care God he has got a good plan for us
[1:03:50] we as human beings we think we can plan
[1:03:53] better than God
[1:03:56] but not at all God has the best plan and
[1:03:59] if you give your life unto him I have
[1:04:03] got better
[1:04:04] plans got good plans for you to bring
[1:04:07] you to unexpected
[1:04:10] end and when you get into his
[1:04:13] hands you must care so that you fulfill
[1:04:17] his
[1:04:18] will amen and that's why we pray and say
[1:04:22] your will be
[1:04:23] done amen the will of God is not to do
[1:04:28] us evil it's not to do us Havoc to do us
[1:04:32] well when hope comes to
[1:04:35] Henry as a husband and wife he should be
[1:04:38] able to know that he has got good
[1:04:43] plans amen a husband should have good
[1:04:47] plans to make the wife happy and the
[1:04:50] wife also should have good plans make a
[1:04:53] husband Happ so you can be able to say
[1:04:57] your will be done because you know the
[1:04:59] will of the husband and the will of the
[1:05:02] wife is to do
[1:05:05] good is that amen the Bible tells us in
[1:05:09] in Proverbs
[1:05:11] 31 he talks about that woman she will
[1:05:14] always do her husband
[1:05:17] good and her husband is
[1:05:19] pleased her husband is respected because
[1:05:23] she wants him to be happy
[1:05:27] amen and when we are
[1:05:29] praying God we don't ask the Lord to
[1:05:34] change to we don't ask to change God's
[1:05:37] mind because we know his mind is
[1:05:40] perfect we ask God to change our
[1:05:44] mind God change my mind because your
[1:05:48] will is good if you have got something
[1:05:50] which is not right in a marriage and you
[1:05:54] know your spouse has has got good
[1:05:57] intentions you to change your mind so
[1:06:01] that you can have the same
[1:06:04] mind amen and when you have the same
[1:06:07] mind you will
[1:06:09] achieve when you are united you can
[1:06:12] achieve
[1:06:14] greatly and that comes when your minds
[1:06:17] come
[1:06:19] together there was a young man he was a
[1:06:23] Catholic he was given a book to
[1:06:26] pray and he was praying for his mother
[1:06:30] the mother to get
[1:06:32] well and later on the mother died the
[1:06:36] boy got the book went and B the
[1:06:39] book said I don't need it because I was
[1:06:43] praying for the mother to live and she
[1:06:46] has
[1:06:47] died
[1:06:49] why sometimes we react like that is that
[1:06:53] amen we throw away the books
[1:06:56] this because it hasn't given us what we
[1:06:59] wanted but did you know the will of
[1:07:03] God he has better
[1:07:07] plans amen if things are not working in
[1:07:10] your way it doesn't mean that God
[1:07:14] doesn't love you that he doesn't
[1:07:17] exist when we marry there are times
[1:07:21] things don't work
[1:07:22] exactly don't throw away
[1:07:26] amen amen ask the Lord will you change
[1:07:29] my
[1:07:30] mind your word because you have better
[1:07:33] plans if somebody has got good
[1:07:36] intentions good attitude good motive and
[1:07:41] you is mistaking
[1:07:42] it you should really pray that God
[1:07:46] changes your
[1:07:49] mind do you love the Lord because the
[1:07:52] Bible tells us everything works together
[1:07:55] for
[1:07:56] good to them that love God so if you in
[1:07:59] the love of God whatever is going to
[1:08:02] happen it will be for your good because
[1:08:06] he has got good
[1:08:08] plans amen so when we get married we
[1:08:12] need to please
[1:08:14] others it's a very hard thing to please
[1:08:16] a
[1:08:19] person we are going to look at it it's
[1:08:22] not easy to please a
[1:08:23] person but when you get
[1:08:26] the Bible says You must care to please
[1:08:28] that
[1:08:31] person is that amen uh there was a
[1:08:35] question
[1:08:36] asked that if you are going to get
[1:08:39] married you are just the beginning you
[1:08:43] get a dream and then the dream is
[1:08:45] showing you a certain
[1:08:48] sister you see her we having good time
[1:08:53] we are going to have a bright future
[1:08:56] and then when you look at that dream you
[1:08:58] say I wish this dream comes to pass
[1:09:01] because I was so
[1:09:03] happy amen then you wake up you go and
[1:09:07] meet that sister and said sister do you
[1:09:10] know what I have a
[1:09:13] dream and the dream was we were living
[1:09:16] together and we were so
[1:09:20] happy then the sister
[1:09:22] looks says brother I would have nothing
[1:09:26] about against
[1:09:27] that but one thing when I look at it me
[1:09:32] I think I would not be happy with
[1:09:35] you there's a brother whom I feel I
[1:09:39] would be much happier
[1:09:45] with how do you
[1:09:48] feel what would be your
[1:09:53] reaction somebody is telling you be
[1:09:57] happier with another
[1:10:00] person but for you you have had a dream
[1:10:04] that you would be happy together if you
[1:10:07] a real
[1:10:08] Christian are together you would say God
[1:10:12] bless you Sister I want you to be happy
[1:10:15] if you would be happier there I think I
[1:10:18] would be
[1:10:19] happy why you care for the happiness of
[1:10:24] that person
[1:10:25] but if you don't care for the happiness
[1:10:28] of that person you save these people
[1:10:31] that's why you never Prosper that's why
[1:10:33] you
[1:10:34] unfortunate you are missing a lot you
[1:10:37] know you be get all sorts of words who
[1:10:40] never help you who whoever bring you
[1:10:43] out together but we must be
[1:10:47] careful other people are happy as we are
[1:10:51] happy is that amen if she's not going to
[1:10:54] be happy
[1:10:56] it's very difficult to keep an unhappy
[1:11:03] person somebody who is not happy with
[1:11:06] you your looks
[1:11:08] irritate your looks irritate
[1:11:14] them your words they they so
[1:11:19] bad even when they hear you are coming
[1:11:22] back they feel you I wish you never came
[1:11:25] back
[1:11:29] am but when somebody loves you and is
[1:11:33] happen with you when you delay a little
[1:11:36] bit they saying we are waiting for you
[1:11:39] we are waiting for
[1:11:40] you but if they don't like you you can
[1:11:47] St it's very hard to stay with somebody
[1:11:49] who is not
[1:11:50] happy so we must Endeavor to have our
[1:11:54] partners happy
[1:11:56] is that amen we must make sure that they
[1:11:59] are really they are
[1:12:02] enjoying do you love the Lord so one who
[1:12:06] happiness should be one who
[1:12:10] Joy if your wife is not happy you can
[1:12:14] never be happy but if she's happy you
[1:12:17] will be happy I believe God is happy
[1:12:21] when we are
[1:12:22] happy is that amen so the same thing
[1:12:26] should be husband is not happy you
[1:12:30] wondering how can I make this man
[1:12:34] happy so great
[1:12:37] care is that amen so the happiness of
[1:12:40] others should
[1:12:43] matter even much more than our
[1:12:48] happiness I want my wife to be
[1:12:52] happy my wife would want me to be happy
[1:12:56] amen so we are always working our ways
[1:12:59] to make sure that we make each other
[1:13:02] happy you pray for one another amen it's
[1:13:06] like the way you are saying let God be
[1:13:08] pleased with
[1:13:11] me amen you know you there are things
[1:13:14] that would be good for you if God is not
[1:13:17] happy with that you feel like you have
[1:13:20] lost
[1:13:20] it I want something that would make God
[1:13:23] happy
[1:13:25] amen may God make the marriage of Henry
[1:13:28] and and
[1:13:30] hope a happy
[1:13:32] marriage a blessed
[1:13:34] marriage amen because happiness it
[1:13:38] cannot be

[1:32:23] cre a home which will be satisfying as
[1:32:26] the home where the man and and the woman
[1:32:28] have come from is a
[1:32:38] problem is a
[1:32:41] feeling of some memories in the
[1:32:48] past there are times it's a sickness
[1:32:51] serious sickness I'm saying
[1:32:55] you know when you away from
[1:32:57] home there are times when a feeling
[1:33:00] comes upon

[1:33:41] Nostalgia and now when this happens it
[1:33:45] always can happen at the beginning of
[1:33:48] the
[1:33:48] marriage it can happen in the middle of
[1:33:50] the marriage it can even happen at the
[1:33:53] end of the marriage

[1:37:30] older sometimes before they even die
[1:37:33] saying take me home take me home what
[1:37:36] the problem they want to look at that
[1:37:39] land there's something calling back
[1:37:42] there something about home always home
[1:37:46] is the best you must be able to know how
[1:37:49] to
[1:37:54] sometimes you have to say let us go

[1:38:15] visit I stop on that there are changes
[1:38:19] that happen in life and you must be able
[1:38:21] to understand your pattern don't
[1:38:24] sometime there are menual
[1:38:27] changes amen the sisters you find them
[1:38:30] behaving
[1:38:33] well something has
[1:38:36] happened I was a teacher one time but
[1:38:39] when he would be at school I would see
[1:38:41] how teachers would K those big
[1:38:45] girls and I now come to understand when
[1:38:47] I
[1:38:48] grow that they lacked understanding
[1:38:51] because some of these girls
[1:38:53] when they are big they go through
[1:38:55] menstrual
[1:38:57] cycles and when they are suffing like
[1:39:00] that I mean change they can't do things
[1:39:04] like the way
[1:39:05] they
[1:39:16] say sometimes even husbands do that you
[1:39:21] dodging you doging
[1:39:24] I will end
[1:39:27] there sometimes a change in
[1:39:29] life sometimes when women get
[1:39:32] pregnant they become
[1:39:38] wild they become
[1:39:40] sickly they become dodgy and if you are
[1:39:44] not careful you say This Woman This
[1:39:47] Woman what's wrong with the woman it's
[1:39:49] wrong with your
[1:39:51] understanding I will go the last one
[1:39:54] it's called
[1:39:58] menopause when a
[1:40:00] woman
[1:40:02] man
[1:40:05] gr you stop going through cycles
[1:40:08] of and that change of
[1:40:12] cycle is very
[1:40:16] difficult some of them feel like the
[1:40:18] world is Turing upside down
[1:40:23] the women they can become
[1:40:26] sickly some of them they run away from
[1:40:29] their
[1:40:30] homes 30 years in
