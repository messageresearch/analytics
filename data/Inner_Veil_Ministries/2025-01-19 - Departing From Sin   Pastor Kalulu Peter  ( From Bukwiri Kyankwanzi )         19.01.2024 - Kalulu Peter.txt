that time we never had message books many message books at that time and there were no smartphones even the C were not we rarely there actually without having one praise the name of our Lord but I would go to brother Mal's Place Mal and then I pick the message books and then iotop those message books and then I had my copies and then I read when I finish I take those then I pick so it helped me be strong when I was studying praise the name of our so you have no you have the smartphones you have the table on the phone and then you said that you are dying when the food is there praise the name of our Lord so there are no excuses for this generation even our pastor would say in the early 80s old late 70s he would go to maybe a place like or anywhere where a brother had a message book and then would sit and read that message book from there and write what you want because there were no many photoping machines at that Compu but now we have many message you can have all the message in the Bible the phone you can have all the Mage on the computer to get a of message it was rare you find that one message is having either something like two or you may end up may feeling car but all

praise the name of our Lord so on S Sunday Sunday we are going to have a concert of Music original music to be a worship when you talk the word concert some people get stumbled they think it's just like the world you check the messages find brother talking about it praise the name of our Lord so we are not thinking about evil things but we are thinking about glorifying the name of the Lord so on Sunday next week the whole day that God can be woried in the songs that the brothers have have composed on Sunday afternoon last Sunday I happen to come and sit when they were singing one of the songs

God is doing a lot of things it's only that many times we don't share what God is doing you know maybe like photos or testimonies and things like that but the Lord is doing a lot like a number of

God who gave me the safe travel must reach here reached here around 4 p.m. yesterday God was gracious the most important things I God he gave me salvation amen and he gave me complete salvation not partial salvation when he got this message and then the eyes were opened amen before I got the message we reading the Bible and they were teaching us the Bible from Revelation to from Genesis to Revelation and I've read the Bible six times but I'm got surprised when I got into the message I was as if I never read the Bible hallelujah amen and I understood the Bible better the Bible became a new book and became so precious more than all the read the Bible that he gave me Grace and blessed me to know him praise the name of our Lord I'm a married person having a wife she's a woman and is a human being understand why do I speak such a word the world is completely spoiled where somebody comes and declares that a man should be married to a man but me God helped that I was married woman and understanding woman that's a t that I thank God hallelujah amen this morning we shall share with you you'll hear part of my testimony having a lot of testimony just pick a but if I'm said to speak all that the Lord has done we can leave this place in the night I just speak a few I have a big testimony from the time I was born up to right now the pastor told me that we going I'm going share with you the word of God I felt happy when like David felt happy praise the name to be in the temple of God for me to come and share with you praise the name of the Brethren from church they sent you their greetings they love you so much even my wife sent you his hers they knew that I'm going to be here they love you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ let us stand up and take scripture reading the title in all of what we going to talk about departing from sin hallelujah amen we go to the Book of Romans Romans chapter 12 the first verse and the second verse it says Romans 12 vers1 to verse2 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen amen let us pray oh our heavenly father we thank you because you are good we thank for this time you have given us it is the time to break your bread the Lord was there when you giving you are the same now I believe that every person you are going to feed them and they going to be full give me Grace oh God talk to your children I pray father you bring a blessing your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you can be seated praise the name of our Lord I just am pleased with this scripture whenever I read this scripture my life gets prepared Paul was talking saying iech you Breen give your bodies as a Living Sacrifice praise the name of our Lord he was talking about the word beeking pleading withen to give their bodies as a Living Sacrifice to give our bodies as a Living Sacrifice there are so many things because this body especially it brings us into sin it is what has brought everything to get bad even in home but saw it that's why he said I besch you Breen by thees of God present your bodies to be a Living Sacrifice now that means allow to have your body as a Living Sacrifice there is where you have to leave the body to die to die and to sinaise the name of our Lord when I read about for explaining that word and then I say Lord I Thank thank you to deliver me from the pcal organization I used to read this scripture but it was more like news to me and even the one reading news there some understanding he get but for me I was not getting anything out of and you know I was reading this while I was teaching when I was even what I was teaching I was not understanding but when I got the Living God that's when I got the true understanding of this scripture praise the name of our Lord how do you offer your body as a Living Sacrifice so first of all your body has to live the things of the world to give your body as a Living Sacrifice in other words you have to bring your body to church that is the sacrifice if you have come to church knowing whom you are worshiping hallelujah amen so you have to give the body what you want not what the bodys Hallelujah am what the spirit wants is what you have to give to the body not what the body wants now that's a Living Sacrifice hallelujah amen for example the says in firsty chapter 2 verse 9 let us read there and see in 1 Timothy chapter 2:9 in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest appro with shamefacedness and sober and not with braded hair or gold or pearls or costly Arrow but which becometh women professing godliness with good works amen praise the name of our Lord we see that giving our bodies to be a Living Sacrifice you have to get away from the pleasures of this life you must make sure that where you putting your body isure knowing that also where you you are settled not up and down the clo of dress your body is worth here they said that even women you know they should be with putting on they ad themselves with modest even men should like dress decently even when he goes to the shop to buy a cloth should buy a cloth that's worth of a Christian so that when people find you on the road they will know that you have God like you can get a youth on the road is dressed like somebody who stays in the but they is saying that I'm saved I found somebody who that and he had bought a and then I got him going to the terring and he wanted to be cut and he wanted it to be tight I asked him when you bought the TR didn't you see it he said that this was so big here that one is good for old people the name of saying that dressing with which are you need to find out if I'm dressed this way and then I witness to somebody that get saved will the person really say truly I'm saying the right thing the second verse in Romans chapter 12 it was telling us and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that which is good and acceptable and perfect will of God hallelujah amen whenever you prepare your body you are actually kind of calling upon the ghost to come upon you and when you know you determine yourself that you are saved you are inv to come into your life so now if you allow your body for if you have been putting on a you start now putting your body as sacrifice before God praise the name of our Lord when you live putting on trousers when you a woman and then you see other women putting on trousers and and then for you give that up giving your body as a Living Sacrifice before God praise the name of our Lord the moment you start being ashamed there's a message I was reading by Brother asking that is your life worth of the was asking is your life worth of the Gospel then he said you move maybe past three blocks of houses if you not find women who are naked you'll come and tell me and then he said people have become mad if somebody you know doesn't have any shame becomes a if somebody undresses when if somebody if somebody starts putting on a night dress and goes to the town if somebody has put on a me that person has an evil spirit now that evil spirit is the madness somebody a woman buying a TR knowing that for men that person is already mad and there something compar and I found it was and he says many people see mad people eating from rubbish and they think those are the only but then there are mad people in the church and they are just mad get a good cloth and then they go that one is mise the name of when I read that message I said this is a great so I brought it to Romans don't be like the generations of because the time we are in the generation is spoiled the living in every person wants follow but if you follow the Fashions Of The World God can never be in such a he say we should not be confounded to this [Music] world but let us be transformed renewing our mind that's how we shall serve the Lord to be the truth and then we shall see that it's pleasing praise the name of whenever you whenever you behave well you can even tell somebody th says the Lord in that message is your life worth of the go and then he said that even men they have also started becoming mad you find a man just direly doesn't then he says isn't that person mad you know there are three things there is being in the village and then there's also being in the and then is also being in your but all those things though they exist you don't requ those things to be in you when you in the village you don't need the village when Village don't allow the village to be new but that that one cannot refuse from being in the village if you are in the town you in town but don't allow the town to influence because there are many evil things done in the town so if you going to know everything which is in town you are ending up when you're not born again or saved we are in this age but you don't need this age to be in you but yet living in this age because this is the age you are preaching in the gospel we in the but we shouldn't allow the influence of this age praise the name of our Lord then he said that for men they have started becoming mad they have started you know become you know bleaching themselves and then you find him maybe the way he has worked in the and then he stays at home and then stays there he doesn't wash his but again demanding food from the wife praise the name of our Lord now when you get that one on the way between a mad person and this and this one who says because a mad person is always dir and you also dirty now who how will differentiate between the right the person who is sober and one who is M whenever I read the message I always ra my that even this a man be clean especially man who has [Music] beli because you're the one with the true how would you say thus says the Lord when you are dirty your sht is dirty your shoes and maybe sometimes you're not there even those who get names in the village that the shirt is always dir so they just call them dirty person when the people have given you a bad name in the vage even the Bible says don't be like confounded but be renewed praise the name of our Lord this verse did me a lot when I understood it and then I started witnessing the gospel because when I knew it and I knew I'm not of this as I'm in this world I'm not of this world so my knowledge has to be changed the which was thinking of other things let it go away that I may get the true knowledge the things that are pleasing to God you may be there and everything you doing there is nothing and there is nothing whiches but you may think that you are correct praise the name of our Lord but whenever you get you know the knowledge your mind be renewed that's where God can reveal himself hallelujah praise the name of because like somebody is going to marry reveals himself to the wife even the wife reveals to the husband praise the name of our Lord now that one put it in the but now when we go to the spiritual Christ is our husband now Christ is our groom your husband has to reveal himself and then you get to know him well even you as a wife you must reveal yourself to your husband for your husband to know you so Christ reveals himself to the one who is ready to be revealed to so Christ will be revealed to you you must change your mind you must depart away from the things of the world I always get surprised in God has always been helping us I've always been teaching it while praying to the Lord you find a man you find a you find a you find even a woman they have the thinking a lot of thinking they have a lot of thinking but more than what they think about God for example we have youth can have a football team supports can tell you the first SC SC the first goal inal the first goal Aral can even take tell you that hisory but when you ask them tell me where did preaching theel and you can that person the and they don't know it praise the name of Lord hallelujah amen but then he goes and sits in the can even know the the price of each player the they going to play and all the things about the football so you find such a person with all the know the [Music] world but when you ask him just about eight verses in the scriptures tell you what they mean he doesn't know anything praise the name of our Lord but he knows all the things of the world somebody can Nar you a bus how the business canate Mone and how the business you can all that is in his and can even do Accounting in your business but when you tell them okay you tell me about the Bible from Genesis Revelation tell me more about the how many books are there in the Bible I say that one is for the pastor praise the but he knows how to calculate profits and losses in his business and then you can get a woman in a village when for the songs all the the world the songs of the world when she's maybe sorrowful start singing those and then tries to count them and he tell them sing for me five songs when you have not looked in the book and say that that to sing but other songs which are of the world they can sing but for the gospel they can't sing praise the name of I always tell the church I tell them let us learn the songs when all the songs are in your heart or in your it's not that going to going to move with the going to your most of those mothers don't have so if you don't know the songs how are you going to sing the song which can help you in need now when when I get into the message we first desire the message songs come with my wife here and then he said how can we learn those songs then I do you want those songs she said she wanted these songs of the goel then I told her you take them in the name of Jesus Christ we never had any song book not Engish we have many language we have many tribes there so there are many songs so they have multiple tribes and people have learned songs in their tribes but one thing which excit me the message songs The Voice is the same if you are singing and then when he singing [Music] also the is the so it excites us when we singing the ryms are the the words may be different but the rythm is the same praise the name of our Lord and then my wife said I want those songs Church the song we first Learned was number two amazing whenever I wanted to sing a song from the message we sing about and there is Pastor Ian from us that song he came to our church he it in English we as him you interpret TOA he he was challenged but we when he went back it took two days and then he he sent us the the voice audio and we learned that song and we enjoyed that song we borrowed a song book from a brother for three days I told my children don't go to class but spend time writing these songs we bought the books and they started writing those books in their notebooks when they finished writing the books the songs now we needed to know how these songs are Su but we are happy we got those songs written down everybody was keeping their book and they were sleeping they were having their books led by themselves when they were going to church and it was raining they would rather leave the books inad of the book being spoed by rain so God helped us there is a pastor called Pastor M there so I told him help us with one person from your church that he can come to our church and teach us at least for two weeks and then he said I'm sending you a person from my church for one month praise the name of our Lord and so he gave us that brother and that brother taugh us the songs when he us the songs in the song book and we said Lord we want to learn more and God Made A Way brother James sent us songs of in audio form from that time we have been learning these songs and I have my daughtered she's able to know each song by the number it is in the book so for you when you start singing say is number number so we got knowing where the songs are hallelujah praise the name of what I'm really talking about a generation the things of the world and thinking of the mind of the and then the mind of God gets God can reveal many things to you praise the name and God can use you hallelujah praise the name of our Lord and God using you and you also become faithful to God and you also become faithful to the people even you become faithful to the village for you who is saved and now you in the if you become a past of that Village you are the pastor of that Village you become the past of your neighbors even if there is a person but you become a [Music] pel jeel but God knew Elijah the that Elijah was the P of those people prise the Lord hallelujah amen so what God Delights let us not go by the world we should speak like people are born again if we are to dress let us dress like born again the church that has only been there for two years in the message but even a Muslim because I found a sh Muslim sh and stopped me and the sh was the Muslim sh was telling me I want to talk to you then I asked him why why do you want talk because when I was under the PC organization we're always fighting with Muslims you know interpreting the Bible and thean to me that was my work we bring the Bible and even bring the Quan so he bring things which will hurt you or he also criticizes he criticizes what the B what in the Quran praise the name and then he stopped me then I told him I to do things of fighting one another why why do you want me so this sh who is a Muslim leader told me I want to appreciate you I said what is it said that I thank you because you have made things well how you've made your church well even your family and then I said how does it be he Liv in a village called so he said in the of this Village that even me as a person I'm I've failed to raise my children but we've searched this town and this Village your church is the one people dress properly praise the name of and he said I can give you my child and start spraying from your church and he says I fully support you all these other churches I can't allow my children to go there he says I see your we see your children going to church and then we look at this generation and then we look at your daughters we look at your wife and then we said there are no people disciplined or behaved well like this praise the name of why am I saying that you are the in your V so if you say you're message believer but you're the one in gambling in complaining in all sports betting you will not get somebody get born again Hallelujah there's nobody who will admire you as an example if are examp to the rest in dressing in you speak in your behavior in every praise the name of our Lord if you know that maybe you cut your hair after one week now don't allow it to grow you must be what you meant to be if you decide that when I'm going to church then put on the next day they will ask you today you're not going to pray because you not put on a so they know when you're going to church you are smart you have touched in well your so when they find you sh today you have not g to church is Sunday so you don't you don't but continue doing good prise the so you have been renewed your mind has been renewed and so you have departed from the things of this generation praise the name so I pray for the sister that God Contin reveals to his grace when the Bible says that the woman should not put on what pertains to a man and a man put on what pertains to a woman the B say such but now some some people have changed the way they dress they go and buy a trouser and then gets also a long dress so he says the the trous is inside and then the dress on top not knowing that still she has put on a trous so anything that's long like maybe like you know trouser that one is a TR and now it pertains to a man when I got the message you know I tried it on my little children and then I brought a p trying to prove this pants they put on a day for the men or for the women so he got a book and Drew the I put you know the stretched [Music] legs and then put drew the pant or the trous way then he also put there a and then put also a dress my son has never gone to school he's very young then I asked him what is this then he told me that this is a trouser and then asked him who put on this trouser then he said it's men then ask what is this this is a dress who put on the dress says it's women and then now I this is now then now a woman says that the leing or the PS are for women the Bible says when you do that Abomination to it means is abominable it means something deceitful DET tful like you know f f treise the so when the Bible says leave it you also have to leave it when the Bible says leave this you have now that's preparing for the bride when the bride still and when she's a bride of Christ the time they are going to they are going to find out the and you know that there is no bride who be picked when they are not upright there is no bride going to be picked when they find doing hous but bride are going to find when they outs but the true bride the bride of Christ must prepare herself to prepare you have to leave what the body and then you go and do what the body the spirit wants praise the name of our Lord huah Amen Let me give you my testimony from the time I was given birth to up to now it can also help you it can help one another he was born on 12th April 1978 ande and then the father called Francis but the I was born you know it was more like pick play or something which was my mother was 14 years mostly 14 years and then the father was 15 years mother was in p and then the father was learning how to S and then saw the mother conceived and then he was given birth to so to know my father he knew the father after 14 years praise the name of our Lord so I didn't know all that Mom going to and then married in another place so I was raised like that then I came back to the grandparents so I was there so going to school was a challenging thing but God raised me up because my mom was married to person who was drinking and then one day I got you know MOS was a painful dise children become blind and dump then the mother said and say that it was almost like that when I got sick so the father-in-law called her and then he says the son has died so they started weeping but he had given the father money to buy medicine you know there was things which happened during those days and you know like when they bury somebody they would spend a lot of days there and so the father was at the funeral so they picked him that your son has and even he had used the money so about for about 3 hours so after 3 hours they found that there was some kind of pation in the body and then then I was able [Music] to so they tell me that I was about six years when that happened so when when actually I was awakened up and then I became fully healed so I've never been to the hospital because of that kind of sickness but I see people fall sick we have been seeing people going hospitals and even some have died so when I raised up I thank God for protecting but I don't know why God had to make me you know be delivered from Death so now I was raised by my mother so I started demanding my mother where is my father then she told me just keep quiet then I went to my grandparents my grandparent then I asked my grandparent where is my father then they showed me my father when they showed me my father then i' say let me be here so I stayed there with my father for trying to know his condition you know he was a witch doctor I hope you know you understand not these ones who F but the other one would use a lot of charms when I was in p and I told him then I told him chased us from school for 2000s then he told me you better get at this age you need to marry I felt bad then he told me if not you better go and line up because when I was at school children would fear me saying that you're coming from my home of each doctor because all these people who are IM whenever they would hug their wi they would die praise the name of Lord so all the children actually isolated themselves from me because I was coming from which doctor's home so I left that home of my father I went to my grandparents and then I stayed at my grandparents and the grandparent Raised Me Up So my father migrated from went to but my father was just was running away from because they were choosing him of things he has done using witchcraft so when I grew up after around 18 years [Music] so they told me that there was good land there in ch when I reached there I reached there and it was land he gave me about 17 Aces but then the drinking water was brown this side used to clean water so I left that place and came back back in7 1997 and so the conditions became tough this8 there was a pcor preached to me the gospel and then accept the Lord Jesus as but why was I getting saved I wanted my name to be changed that is the son of that I'm not more counted to be a doctor but I wanted to be called a saved person and then I said that will be a good tile I AC the Lord Jesus as my personal sai8 the same month that I I I was born is the same month that accept the lordes as my personal savior now in 2000 they gave me a church to Pastor it was in and then I was a pastor of that church we had about people in the church but then economically was very hard to be there then I said I have why don't go there so he had told him let me he went to at that was part of not yet been divided so I was in and then we started you know planting then I said let me do all that I can but then i' accept the Lord Jesus as my when I told my father that you know there should not be anything you should do like a rual may have accept the Lord Jesus as my personal savior then he told me if you have taken Christ as your personal savior you better live in my life I've never I've never been with people are foolish like saved people so again I left I went to another Village so as a parent he told me when I came back he went to at that time he had over 60 children right now he's having over 100 children praise the name of Lord but me I'm the child now so when he told me that you come back I came back but he came back with two wives just young women then he told me that this one is yours and then this other one is mine then him why did you do such a thing so he said I'm giving you this wife this other one is mine then I told him father thank you for us ased people we don't marry like that and then he became angry he tell tells me come back but again he brings a wife for me I refuse her so he says either I should just kill you then went in my heart said God help me and then the Lord helped me and in the following day he got a person would give that girl and then they gave him his money the girl was in that place mon they got when she had stolen then I told my father you see what you you going to do then he said please forgive me then he told me let your people get you a wife then there I was able to get some Rel and then I started preaching the gospel in on that Village there is a place which was given out it is called and then Village is called they said we put there five AC every place of worship should come and get a free land here to worship from here were were there protests and now for me I was the only person who was p then I told them also give me the land for a child then they gave me one then I said God we going toship from here and I saw God brought one woman she was saved then I said let us start praying from here we started from there a church and that was the first church of Pentecostal in that place in that same Village the church grew up you know they they got many cones into church and even from and so would sing language so when they reached about 100 so they found somebody who knew their language and they said this is the person should P us said let that person p and then I went to another place we started many churches in West UGA so I came back to to and then I came and handed over started and then I was because he was a bishop we started many churches I was a pastor in church many years now in 2021 we had to as I told that they will teach you the Bible from Genesis to Revelation and we learn the Bible so he had a friend called he a pastor inal so they were under the same Pastor in then he told me do you know I left all that confusion of Pentecostal said if it is possible you would have received this message then I said ah then I told him let us prepare for a meeting so we prepared for a meeting and the meeting would be then I called [Music] him about one week to the meeting date my sister me from and then she told me that Pastor just bring Breen she knows then she told me that if you know that we breastfeed the same bre don't allow those men to come then he said that gospel is wrong that if you going to receive them you are finished then I if my sister told me what should I do now and then called Pastor do you you know what we better of me you know there Cheng so we better postp that's how I and so we can the meeting for he kept quiet now was over we went into the year 2022 in February and then he asked me why don't we prepare again another meeting and I had many churches under myol then I told if this gospel is bad let me not bring in my church because wasters even my wife was pastoring in that church then I said I will not take this gospel to where I stay even where my wife pastors let me take them to new churches if if the gospel is false we shall handle with those new people don't anything so he invited Pastor then he said I'm coming with my pastor in a district of place and I had friend of mine was a p in that church called he was also a bishop so he had told me that for him being a bishop he doesn't Pastor churches so he had told me to come and Pastor his churches they told me that these are churches under you betterle them then I told him as you have handled this churches let me also bring this new teaching now when the dayed that's when he saw brother James then he came and ministered then he started ministering the first day he preached the one God and that is Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord and I just kept [Music] quiet I didn't want to because he Wasing and I would check in the Bible what is reading and is the same then I said am I the one who is wrong or not [Music] then he told me that Jesus is God for us we used to three Gods then he said God is one not two not three then he said those three gods are in Witchcraft and I thought that was hurting me then I thought maybe this is the truth when we finished the meetings there was a meeting in then he told us that if you have accepted that this is the truth so the bishop where at the church we had going to say that this is the truth and we have accepted it so he picked us from and brought us to his home so the following after coming back we went to when we reached was also preaching and again preach that woman should not be a then I started asking what has this then I said my wife is a good pre for the you know and then the thought came that you know after 3 days they had given us 600,000 then I said my wife to miss this I was working this they were giving me she was and giving and we doing well and a woman should not be a and then he read all the and I also reading those scriptures then I said how am I going to start telling my wife these things so we left when we reached brother's place I thank God that brother I've learned many things from just like they that AES the young to F so he has learned a lot from pastor and Pastor James so he went back to i' written down all the subjects then my wife said welcome then I told her I've come back but the other was a meeting then I gave her the book a notebook that you better read yourself said where did you get these things from I got from the Bible where learning then she said isn't it what your sister warned you against that be careful of those people then I told her you better leave what my sister said you better read the Bible don't about what the sister but what the Bible says she read the but she would not understand she would repeat the scripture for six times and said I don't understand this it came in the morning and then another month there was a meeting in May so they were able to travel so came with other six people the wife then the wife of the bishop and then the overseer was taking over the was heading all the churches in then I told you better come so they came with their gos with the go was putting on was you know distinguishing differently you know the other had something a little bit different then we came for the meetings in May and then Pastor St started PR he preached for two hours and 47 minutes we listen to the message well heot the message and then goes back into the Bible for the message were not understanding and then wondering why he was reading this we not seeing them in our Bibles so my wife don't you think this is the truth so when they were lunch in house then Pastor asked her pastor pastor's wife what have you heard she said that I've heard this is the truth then she said what what do you think about this then the wife said the wife said I don't want to go to hell so when they were going back home to the wife told him that you better get another person to become the pastor to be you know under Pentecostal being you know a great hon whenever they say Pastor coming they run very fast pick the Bible from him now when she reach the church as a pastor they ran to pick the Bible from she refused they asked Pastor what has happened to so the wife said you better leave me alone now that day I had to go to church because told me I'm no longer a pastor then you know like the owner takes up the then I told her you better leave I'm going to do a pastoring work put chair they put her chair at the ppit she removed it and she put it behind what has happened to you Pastor she said that I've seen the truth and then she said those women who like the pulpit you like the pulpit but not that there is Hell praise the name of our Lord so they thought she was joking then I also got the mic I preach to them the truth that wife of mine you see she has seen the truth she's no longer a pastor but she's just a Christian a true Christian of God and now you see as the bride ofr she's preparing for Christ's coming praise the name of our they were not understanding but for us we tell them for us we have understood what we are on WEAU we came with another brother called in those meetings he also believed the message the overse of the district refused and then started theel is totally different we told you many are but few are chosen we started preaching in our church and then about the was put then I told those were put on those are just H but when Jesus was on when he was preaching he did never put on a disting I said if he had a a different dress maybe AAR [Music] they would have come knowing that Jesus but because he was dring like the he was it was somebody among them but when I preached that go CH they people were covering my the video and then they sent to my bishop and then he called me he said why are you abusing me put on don't you know that from America you didn't see the white man who dressed Us in those don't you know that your dressing of priest came from America now what's wrong with that the wrong thing is putting on those kind of if you want to preach the true gospel even our I say those put on those callar and those PRI ropes are the ones who just go in the market who want to be recognized in meeting I said we don't want those things anymore praise the name of then he told me what I'm you you better leave my church we had just finished building that church in bricks and cement and prayed from there 6 months now so he told me you better leave my church but you know he never had the agement he never put there any sign then I was wondering and even now the other Christians were not wanting that why have I removed their Pastor who is a woman others didn't want it others wanted it so when I saw that every Sunday would come to church and we were fighting among ourselves I was preaching like at this time then I told this is my lastone in your church here today I'm this message want it stay here but from today on I'm no longer your I've left this church the one who wants to follow me because of this TR let them follow me so I took with my wife will you follow me I said I will follow you then even my children will you follow me then they say we shall follow then I said you better say bye to these people so they told those people we are going others were crying then I told them you are cry you weeping like for which if you have known the truth I wouldn't have but because you have refus the truth that's why I'm leaving this so I raised the those who are going to follow me I'm going to my home to start a church there we were felling for my home for six months until the lord gave us our place as you know for town you couldn't GA from a place without a until the Lord provided that we to build and we started now gathering in that that was in July 2023 and we started fellowshipping from our own place so we separated ourselves from they knew that this is a church for the message of the hour and we started preaching the gospel then people told me that I'm mad then I said if I'm mad I'm mad for for Christ then the mayor of the town called me then he told me you people are born again we thought you as you have built your building you're going to what is left for you to get and now we seeing you have left a building said now you you are confusing us then I told him you can't understand but me I know what I'm doing the bishop called them then he said the people from him aot of then he started blacking that they tried to give him a car bapti in the name of Jesus Christ and then he refused then I told him then I told him for you you miss for me they baptized me without anything now for they were promising you things why did you refuse those things praise the name of our Lord and then the Lord started establishing brother so come frequently that two or months then also come this way so the wife has been saving us from the time we started the first time my wife visited when she had a small baby not knowing anything about the message then when you breastfeeding do you cover yourself so she breastfeed any so for she was just to bre fre not knowing [Music] anything so when we started reading about a true church we started seeing these things the way the church should be conduct how should the Christian conduct how should the woman conduct herself when she saw that said God forgive me I went to G and I was breastfeeding showing people my breastfeed said I don't know what they about I the times of ignorance wined said you have understood it better not and God told us how we should conduct ourselves that's why the you people in our church there's no woman no girl who puts on a Dr just stopping actually at the knee and we don't have those young men or boys who put on tight and we don't have youth in the church who have their cards we don't person unless maybe hallelujah praise the name of so our sisters come with the clothes if somebody comes not dressed decently they give them to cover themselves then they give a please cover yourself properly so maybe when we have preached to somebody in other Villages but the village where we are the people in the village know those dress the youth don't don't dress in a very fun way they don't kind of sh their those are not there we learn how to conduct ourselves praise the name of our Lord we learn not eat from the church not take phone calls from the so I ask the people do you have any program on phone said then you better switch off your phone when you're in church because they would you put it in silence but then still vibrate I said now if Muslims respect their M yet what they worship is not right they respect their mes what about why don't you respect God remind people your maybe when you want to take but if you're not going to for things of church why do you have a phone and rece receive it and then you miss eternal life praise the name so we learn the discipline of the church and God kept on removing the things of the world and my daughters were completely Disturbed with the is of hair and then my said that she she allow issues of air when she but when we got the message we told her if you don't obey the word you are justed if you don't obey the word you're destined for now she has accepted the message and then I told don't stop at only having long hair and having good dresses when you don't have the word inside of because you like good dresses and they message but when you have rejected the word it's not good praise the name of the Lord so God gave me Grace and give me boldness to preach this message to other people and then I said if I've been opening churches when I'm a pcal now I've got the message of the should I just sit back then I said I better arise every church that I pastored in I should go and preach the gospel if they refuse that's not my but I would have witness to them those who receive me I also receive them so started preaching the gospel and started believing the message accepting this message I went and preached in we have bed 50 people and then we went in the oil fields Ino the first time I baptized people who accepted the message the first day and then after two weeks I went back and baptized about 80 people then I went to R and then I bz another 50 people accepted the message and others would call you on phone come and tell us that message you got the first subject I learned in the message it's only one God they not two they not three but it's only one and that's the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ even if you come at night I would still preach to you one I went and preached to them we are worshiping other gods we don't know but we've got one God andus talking about we didn't know him when I went to I Bap about then the bishop told me you better go to all my churches praise the name I went back to I baptized another 50 people when we left that place we came to Joo we also baptized and there I went toana so in all those places churches open so I would go back those places then I preached there church has about 300 people that time we bz only 180 people when they had known the truth so I continued moving on with the word just last year in in September brother James came for a meeting in our place it was for only two days days we had two days meeting in that place in is the place where people who are cannibal most of them come from there so in that same town there is a church it was being ped by a woman the woman was coming from preaching on the loud speaker she was my friend and then she wanted me to become her P when she left gospel killed her so she left that church there so they received me then I told them you're not going to receive me alone but I have other Brethren so went there with brother James so in September I preached there after preaching there that same day people accept to be bapti were 53 when I have to go back the following I bapz 53 and there were even women pastors there now among the people Bap others were coming from then they called and come and preach in so I went to I preached in people accepted we baptized 84 people now they were coming they were coming from different churches who had come for the meetings now the bishop of that town they became envious they arrested US they took me to the police and then they told the policeman that that this man should produce documents that allow him to be a preacher and even to baptize when I when I was at the police then I asked them what do you want concerning me then they were telling me produce the documents that perm you toe then I gave them the Bible per me to preach then they said they call the Bishop Bop called the bishop and ask him what where does he get authority to preach the gospel preaches then I told them Mark 16 that go and preach the gospel then I told him that's where my permission is and the docent that commission me to go and preach then I asked the police tell ask the bishop to tell us where he gets his authority then he said that I have docents from the government I I told I for if it is for government work forment I'm working for

bring it and we give him the 50,000 the bishop checked all the Bible and couldn't get that and so God helped that I was able to get a ppit at the police station and started preaching to people had gaed there then the polican said me I'm a Muslim but I know it's only one and then the polican asked him you saying this one was preaching one God for you how many gods do you have and then I glorify the Lord if you have the message with you even if you're among 5000 people when you God will not leave you alone praise the name of our Lord then the policeman said you have no CA you have no case to answer you better and then he said if he arrest you again we are here to help so we went ahead and people kept on collect Gathering even the mayor of the Town accepted the message prise the and then

from that place so one of the people have prayed for who was possessed was delivered and then say that he has a wife who is also having a problem so they took me there reached there and then prayed for that woman the leg had actually some kind of for long time and she was giving a testimony they were amputating the leg I prayed for that woman when I just finished praying for her when the leg was still swelling but she was not feeling any pain and then she started walking the one was not walking but the leg was still swollen but then she was saying no long and then she was moving around and people were surprised the following day the swelling started disappearing and then again God raised his the Father the father-in-law to this woman who was healed was a witch doctor in that place she he was one of the head of which doct when he saw that then he said call for me that Pastor I went to the his place then said did you pray for my daughter-in-law I said I'm the one said are you who healed him I said no the Lord Jesus who healed him if you accept the Lord Jesus he will do something in your life then said for a long time he said I've been with wit doctors and he said I've been a witch doctor for many years but there's no life in Witch Doctors then I told but the life if you can accept the Lord Jesus if you accept the Lord Jesus even if you are dead you'll be alive that what actually convicted the told him when you accept the Lord Jesus even if you are dead you will be alive this body will die but then you have eternal life so now he was being convicted in his heart then he said I have a lot of my witchcraft can I bring all my Witchcraft and then you take them and then I get that life said do it then he went then he brought something like dead body then he brought a pot and then things were blood boiling in the pot like burning almost overing but not overing then he said all these are my charms are here then he said if you can take these things away from me then I will get sa then I said all these things which are in the they have no power and then it stopped boiling and then he saw that the things in the PO boiling then he got surprised then he was surprised then I told if I've been in in were also all these people who make people walk at night we would pray for them and then now that I've accepted the message of the can God really refuse to help me then I told them you bring fire and we burn all these things we burnt all those things I got that PO and then I went and pour the substances in the and then I got a and broke it into pieces I didn't do you accept the Lord Jesus then you accept the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah am then I prayed for him he wased with people and then the lorded working like that why am I saying that when I told you my birth was not easy then maybe go so that if this if I die when I'm still young there is some work I should have done praise the name of our Lord so God gave me Grace but one thing which has strengthened me is to read the message whenever I read the message it gives me encouragement I got I read about that message of AUD the prophet was saying that God is hidden behind a veil of a person that was behind the veil of Elijah that was behind the veil of Jesus Christ when I learned that God was in those days the same God we Ser then I said God be behind my ve that message strengthened meise the name then I read another message the Misunderstood God we can maybe read that message the Misunderstood God yes in January 1963 uh there is a portion which talks about your descent descent or descendant asking the prophet question I was baptized when I got saved in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ how can I live a stubborn Spirit which is as if I can't overcome that to leave that stubborn Spirit praise the name of our Lord that question Disturbed me and when the prophet was answering that question that even if you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ can you get away from that evil spirit the prophet said it's okay it's true so he says so my brother oh my sister you as a Christian this question many times many times when you get people who get those which make them like [Music] M there are always complexes that brings this out one of them either they from their father mother Auntie grandar father mother or anybody like that and if yourself you chase it back down through your life you'll find you have taken it has happened to you but now I've taken it by experience discernment those things but then the eyes but in future I've seen those things when I'm on the and many people in thousands who have that kind of spirit the first I was Discerning that Spirit Discerning it by The Things Not Seen then I found out there was a grandfather or a grandmother or there somebody else who is behind these things so you inherit this by your birth praise the name of our Lord that message I read it and then I it took me into some depth many times our faith is limited because of our birth when somebody says I'm born again because there is a spirit there's a spirit from the of maybe anger or maybe Strife or maybe quing mayal praise the name those Spirits can follow from even if they been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you can find somebody still lying but was in the name of Jesus Christ it is EAS to find a he a saved person in church even the wife when God bless you God bless you and then they but when they reach home complaining M starts from there everybody at chur say that person when they reach home they different it's not the other brother you know now that one comes from a when I got this message when the prophet was talking about it is not you you it from your par because you were born in that and then others follows the I'm I don't know what was he like the but because of that because it was not mine it is EAS when you don't know and then you cut them yourself off and then that thing cannot come back so this message remed me from where I come from there was a woman who gave birth to they gave the child a name when they gave the birth the child so the child was crying the whole day when the child was crying the whole day then they went to the witch doctors then wit doctors actually when they reached there then they were told the name you this child the the the grandfather died because he had stolen m bananas that she had stolen she had stolen said if you you going to stop this child from go and steal for her and then cook it and then put one of them then in that soup and then make the that not Contin they did the same they stole the banana they cooked it they gave the child was 3 days and the child sto now don't you see that person was in you may also not know what was done that's what the prophet was talking about somebody can baptize in the name ofes but then still having that nature and then you see somebody doing and then when they come say I don't know what I'm but when they go home they see the same and then they give them the name in the village praise the name when I got this message then I also discovered myself then I went back I was I was actually born in a family where immoral things happen all my decent none of them was going Beyond P so whenever I go to see what is happening then I said this Spirit of not going to school is maybe from generation not maybe there's no or maybe saying why do you take children to school praise the name of our so I called all my children and I told them then I told them you know from our grandparents five generations they have not been going to school make sure that you don't follow this same habit which has happened before or maybe in your family there are people who are drun when that person that Spirit comes and get for another person you know they say know that what happens to your neighbor can at the same time come and happen to your home so when people die Spirits can come back on other people it may not it may not come and catch the one who has received the message but then you can get another person or a child who has never because the Bible says that I Vis the iniquity of your your fathers from the third generation up the fourth generation when you read in Exodus the name God has a generation but now for us who accept the Lord Jesus in truth we have to remove everything because the prophet was talking about it when you discover yourself so now for my background my mother and father the generation was not good okay what happened there whenever they would say that they collecting people okay whenever there was people gathering at it was a funeral there was nothing like any function somebody's having over 100 children how what will happen like a function of marriage then I said that one is the way we come then I tell now you better get the message you'll be married right when they are and they will come at home then I told them young don't take the spirit of my grand my grandfa you better take a hold of the message you make sure that you Mar right praise the name of our so the message is preparing us to be that we established in the truth this is where the Prophet said in that message Audible there is nothing which can be as pleasing God like the life that is fully surrendered to Christ come praise the name of our Lord if you give all your life to Christ he said even if you don't have shoes to put on even if you don't have cloes but if your life sinks the life your life sinks the Life of Christ and then he says what does it what do you benefit by putting on expensive clothes but when your life doesn't have Christ that's why we go back first Timothy Chapter 2 says that even women should Ador themselves in modest not in putting on expensive things or costly up or whatever but women who profess to be doing good works what was the Bible talking about your well dressing let it be inside if you are dressed well you man but even is singing Christ I don't see you appearing well outside but then inside something contrary to what is outside Christ was talking about you know Graves that they make the gra look nice outside but but inside they are rotten bones praise the name of the Lord the Bible says should not be like this generation now you try to put them together what has been missing in your life there is a person in the bible let us read there first Kings chapter 22 [Music] and then verse 34 the scripture says for so First Kings 2:34 and a certain man drew a b at Venture and smot the king of Israel between the joints of the hes wherefore he said to the drive of his Chariot turn thine hand and Carry Me Out of the host for I am wounded and the battle increased that day and the King was stayed up in his Chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of The Chariot and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun saying every man to his City and every man to his own country so the king died and was brought Samaria and they buried the king in Samaria so I I read this place and it was good to me King was in battle they were fighting Ahab wanted Victory but among his them there's somebody who drew a b and then it went up so the Bible says released the bow with without you know without maybe it went actually unconsciously he didn't know whom he was he was Notting anybody but now when the bow went so the arrow actually hit Ahab and so this Arrow went to the Joint where the metals they cover the knees The Joint where in other a free space between the metals the Bible says he was covered with a metal to a joint between the metals praise the name of our Lord what does that mean in that time was one fighting when he was fighting right now we are the ones fighting fighting the enemy he want to take you back for you want to go for ofab was for a physical but for us we have a spiritual dressing so even Satan is not settled he was there when they were shooting that Arrow even now Satan can release that b so how does he find your protection does he find your protection with gaps the if there are gaps in your your your your spiritual we that's where Satan's b or are all that is going to pass what do I mean if you are a saved person but you have refused to leave sin now that's where the devil uses to pass through when we were still young a person in the village you know they would kind of like fight one another they would wrestle with one another and then they would box each other to find out who is the best in the village but God helped us when you knew when you know somebody has been hurt by maybe a then maybe you go and try to disturb that person because they already had you know that the person you are going to fight with is not a so when you fight with person who is having a prick in the foot so for you you step in somebody's even if they are so strong then they would plead please forgive us because they knew they know they have a wound which you can press into prise the Satan knows where your where your weaknesses that's Satan wants to attack so now when Satan know that you left him right he can't bring kind of wom toct I don't drink even if you put in maybe in a place even if they have a lot of Jans of I just when noten so Satan knows that one you overcame Satan knows so Satan knows where your weaknesses so he attacks you by your weaknesses and that's where the arrow passes because this arrow goes in the air it is looking so when it finds a place which is free that free space is where when it finds a place of that's where the arrow will pass when it finds a place of that's where it will pass when it finds a place where there is that's where the [Music] AR when it finds a place where they give that's where it will pass praise the name of our Lord now your weakness you know where your weak but then that's where Satan comes and that's why somebody's in the church a is over and still in the same habit praise the name of our Lord Satan know that when I TCH he doesn't have power so the of the devil looks where you are relax so what covers that Gap you need to go to the AL of and then you cry to the Lord and then he covers when where even if he Pier all that place is covered with praise the name of our Lord so it's only the alar praying to the Lord and then the Lord covers all those weak points praise the name of our David say when I knew that I'm going to I was when I there are people got the presence of but they don't know why they have come in the Pres Prophet says when you go into the church keep hum yourself the S leer comes and then starts the but when he not yet your life now meditate upon that God can that time when you're waiting on the Lord praise the name of it's not good for a person to go to the church then you start creting one another or doing things of conversation it's not good if you read the message some people don't have phones others have but for us we use that opportunity for us who don't haveon as we've been told at the [Music] beginning there were no phones there there were no messages that so for don't have any excuse we have many message books to read if you have a message book get it and read if you have a t listen instead of spending all the time on the phone on things which don't help praise the name of our Lord Jesus said that if your right eye stumble you PL it out praise the name of if there's something stumbling you from going forward you better remove it say that you get eternal life hallelujah amen praise the name of our Lord I Thank that he has done good to us I than God has given us opportunity because of the service we've had today I wanted to share with you my testimony to share with you the word but as I said in Romans 12 verse every day I read Romans 12 it becomes new to but whenever I see it that scripture comes back to me the spirit tells me don't be like the world there's some woman I saw Ina she actually split her tongue She split her whenever she goes to eat she removes the pen when she finishes eating she puts back the then I remember said don't be like those people of the world and you know women have bleached up themselves until they were becoming too brown but even if all those things they just take you to Hell praise the name of our Lord you beat stay with the word of God and then the Lord will your hallelujah amen God has healed my children last year and even this year there was my child who who had a prostate problem then he called me hospital they treated us but there's a message which I read which says why cry speak the prophet was saying when you go to a doctor and they that you have cancer don't just take it like reject that thought and just take it to God do you continue going not saying that I don't have that cancer somebody tells you're not going to leave this place you continue moving so when were in the hospital then he said that your child is sick with prostate then I remember that then I remember the prophet said why Christ we started praying it was the month of July they spent four days in the hospital so he had swollen and then he was all brown rather all the body was swollen up when we prayed and then again they started asking that why is the child started changing then they told us you go and check the K they said we thinking we're going to spend here two months when they checked the kidney then they found that the problem was reducing then I told them you better release us then the doctor said we can't relase you in this we have just spent there three days said you wait when it came in the morning or the child was no more and I told the doctor release us and then he released us we came back home all that time I was reading the message the prophet was saying there's a woman he prayed for after praying for her then he told that go back they check you and then they you come and tell me when the woman went she found that she was healed already then I said let us take the child back so I took the child back then the doctor asked what treatment do you give this child and then I was very happy when he asked me that then I praised the Lord then he wrote to me then I came back with it and when the Lord had heal the child completely I have was doing senior 4 and then started that hicup at school and he almost passed away they gave him all the medicine when he came back home when him to go back home we laid hands on him and prayed for him and then it that same day he went back to school de Master said go back you are still sick say I'm already healed the master said the child was very bad because took a Jer of about just within three days but the child was healed now my last son of two years that come for a meeting which was decided around November when brother Tim came when we went back the child was speaking so well but we reached home when the child was D was not talking at all was only when you tell him give me water just go to the Jer so I called the brother that my child cannot speak anymore then we prayed then we prayed I went to the hospital then they told me he must have been too sick and so the nervous system was affected then I went into the message saying that you better continue praying why do you Christ the one God you serve is we pray to the Lord now the child has been restored and all the Village People and the neighbors say if that child will speak we shall know that your God is but when we had left that they sent a Coke to come home but the way they had worked on it when it comes at night and then start standing around as if then it work goes in the morning so one time my wife followed it it went into the neighbor's house when they had got they were speaking words but every day would come back when I knew that I got that I'm the one who bought with my money if there are any demons in you you know at night it was strange what was happening I I command you to walk and then the the coke turned and then stood I told him you better start walking it was at night around 9 and then I did when the children are the coke walked I said if there is any demon in you I command it to leave in the morning the coke moved properly he went it never came back then for us we left to come in these meetings when we went back the child was not speaking we said we've never produced a death the child was speaking before why does he do such a thing and then just remember Satan was still fighting when you go into the ministry then the devil gets a word to attack you that you leave what you're then but the prophet said continue moving forward whatever challenge comes or whether it is on the or in your business or your wife or husband just ra don't cry but speak from the beginning there was the word even now we have the word speak the word don't cry in concluding I want to thank God for this church and Ministry you stood a lot with the church in your prayers in your finances in all in all circumstances brother James brother St and I thank God for standing with us and even making us to be one with you when you reach and you ask they call when you ask they will direct where the church is who don't allow to cut off hair I tell them it's not us who refuse but it's the Bible which refuses may God bless you so [Applause] much amen praise the name of our Lord do you appreciate that testimony [Applause] amen we thank God for what he's doing in our mid praise the name of our Lord do you appreciate our brother there are very many things he didn't talk about which he didn't talk about praise the name of our Lord but the Lord has been so gracious praise the name of our Lord you know when he went to and then after he had prayed for that Pastor who was backing like a dog and then the people believed so the following day when he was baptizing people a white bir came down and then it stood on the water where I was baptizing and then he was wondering what this is and he said if this is evil power May It Go in the name of Jesus Christ but if it is God manifesting something let it stay so the bir was there where he was baptizing people and the moment iing the last person the bir went away praise the name of and then that same night he dreamed about something which was going to happen and then God showing that there are powers of darkness which were coming and then God showed him how he would be able to overcome and now that's the day he went to the wit doctor's place and the Lord took over everything that there was nothing which happened other than destroying all the witch now that doctor had son in doing the same Witchcraft and the son that the father had accept the Lord Jesus as person the son left Campa with his family and said father I also want to accept the same Jes so you find that a new church

following day for baptism using Mot CES about a distance of 30 km and unfortunately when they were coming back there was a truck coming and there was a lot of dust so the rer went head on on on the track so the the the the motorcycle who was the motorcycle was riding him he died then was in the middle so the person who was behind him he broke the leg I think it's the leg the one who was riding motorcycle brother Peter they took them to hospital and then you know he was having chest pain and then the other one the one was behind him was baptized and then he was saying even if I die now I've taken but unfortunately the one who was riding the motorcycle for him it was just on his business he didn't receive the baptism so he died in repentant sinner but then God protected brother Peter that he never broke anything in his body but he was feeling chest pain so when he went to the HOA hospital they scanned him and then they found there was some blood collected outside the heart somewhere and then they said it was shock and then they told him that one is going to be heal they gave him medicine and God protected him like that but you can see the protection of God in front of you the person has died then behind you the person has broken their leg and then you see the hand of the Lord praise the name of so we always need to continue praying for the people go out in the fields
