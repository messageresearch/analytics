pleasure to be standing before for you this morning and not because I am any better but it's by the grace of God if at all I respect The Men Who stand before the sacred desk if at all I respect The Men Who stand behind the sacred desk because they are men of God and it's not an easy thing to stand here especially when you are preaching to people who have been taught well I always say it's one of the hardest things to preach to people that know what you're talking about because if you make a mistake they can actually look at you and say brother you mised there and the elders will call you after church and say my brother go and sit down a little bit more and start to prove yourself worthy of the vocation whereby you are called so I respect them I always feel nervous when I stand here one can never get used so it's such a pleasure to be in front of You The Chosen bride of Christ in this last day and hour this is the greatest time that any believer would have wanted to live in the prophet explains and say Daniel wanted to leave in this day David wanted to live in this day where all things that were being spoken of by the prophets are being made manifest but it was not given to them but to you and me so like Esther perhaps we were born for such a time as this to prove the devil dead to prove the devil dead and to prove to him that the second Eve will not fail such a privilege I will kindly ask you to join in with me this uh one verse from this song down from his glory we are just going to sing the last verse in the chorus then we can open with a word of prayer oh

love him tonight oh how I love you how I adore you how I adore my bre my son shine my the great Creator great Creator he he I dwell in him may we close our eyes for word of prayer precious gracious heavenly father who dwelleth Inn [Music] bodies with thank you Lord for the privilege and the opportunity to come and Minister your word to your [Music] people Lord any man that went to school can open the pages of the Bible and read on but it takes the very same spirit that inspired the writing of the words to come down and make it PL and reveal it before your children the Bible tells us that the letter but the spirit give life come and Quicken now your mystery before your children that they might be identified and see their lives written in scripture as they look into the mirror of God's word such a time where there is Fe mine upon the land not aine of bread only but of the truth but you have stored up food spiritual food in our season Lord and we are here gather is Eagles around the ccus master to Feast upon th table hide me behind the cross that I may never be seen hide me in the corridors of Calvary that I may never be seen but that you oh God and you alone come and speak to your children I take every spirit and I put it under my feet the glory of God the bound be set free May the sick be healed Lord May them that are lacking Heavenly Father get to meet with you Jehovah J there issues that that are at heart as we believe they are under expectation expectation is the breeding ground for the miraculous we are not going to go back the same way we came thank you Holy Spirit we invite you now come and use oh Lord these lips oh Father and take over this stinking body and use it to speak your oracles to your children in the mighty name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord how many deem it to be a privilege to be here hallelujah hallelujah glory to God I'll kindly ask us to open our Bibles in the Book of Genesis CH 2: 24 I always I always like to preach from The Book of Genesis you know why I love the book so much is is because the devil hates it the prophet tells us that there are two books that the devil hates so much the Book of Genesis because it shows things the way they were before we we fell and he also hates the Book of Revelations because it shows his final destination that's the reason why I like it so much so we shall open our Bibles from The Book of Genesis CH 2:4 so that we can all sit down we shall read from Genesis 224 es 2 ver 15 and first Peter 2 ver 5 it reads in Genesis therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and the twain shall become one the Book of Esther 2:1 [Music] 15 it reads now when the turn of Esther the daughter of abeh the uncle of modai who had been taken for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what her guy the king's ch Bain the keeper of women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all of them that looked upon her 2 15 oh okay Esther chter 2 verse1 15 oh right a second the Book of Esther it's just before the book of JN okay take minut time sorry then we go to the book of second Peter 2 ver 5 we are reading a lot from the second chapter there happens that all of our scriptures are in chapter two it's spoke in Genesis and said the two shall become one flesh so now it's just on the number two number two number two amen second Peter 2 verse 5 and says and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to goodliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity amen God bless the reading of the word may please take our seats first of all I would like to thank the pastors Andor James for making it possible for me to stand here you know it really means a lot when they can trust a young man who is unmarried who is unstable as Paul says Thou shalt not appoint anyone of an office to be a bishop because young men are not stable one minute they are here in Uganda the next thing they get a job in the United States and so if you make them a pastor of a church be rest assured that they are going to leave you behind so it really means a lot for them to trust me and give me an opportunity to stand here I'd like to also thank and extend warm regards from Pastor bu who also made it possible and decided not to hug the gift to himself but decided to share it with the bride of Christ for the edification of his body and above all I would like to thank my pastor he sends his very warm greetings all the way from Zimbabwe you see it really means a lot as well for him to trust me to fly all the way from Zimbabwe to come here without a patron to look after me he says the young man might fall but he trusted me to be a representative of the lighthouse burner it's a privilege hallelujah hallelujah we give God a CL offering may we give God a clip offering without wasting much of our time we are getting right into the word of God hallelujah hallelujah if there is one thing that I'm kindly asking of you please may you give me your amens let the place feels like a Mor F like a m amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen so we have read here in the Book of Genesis and we find out that it is God who instituted marriage marriage was not brought about by any man it was God himself that's why the devil hated so much that's why he fighted so much because it was an original plan of God before even men fell God said and the twain shall become one flesh one might say that was after men had fallen but this is before men had fallen that God said now a man shall C unto his wife he shall leave his father and his mother and them two shall become one flesh then we also read in the Book of Esther where we find out that it was in the time that Jerusalem had [Applause] sied it was under the king that one of the days you see as we shall find out later that there was a queen who used to be there but this queen was against the very law of marriage itself boed to make sure that she get replaced and that's when we see a young girl coming in and Es coming onto the scene and taking the place of v and we've read again in the book of second Peter and we've heard that he's telling the Bride of CH the church that you should add onto these virtues on to your Christian faith got to Virtue you have got to and kindness and long suffering and patience and all those seven hallelujah hallelujah my message tonight is the mystery of the Bride hidden throughout the ages now being revealed and a subtopic or [Music] subheading I would like to call it the bride the mystery of Christ revealed hallelujah hallelujah in my inspiration I got it from Christ The Mystery of God reveal you see Christ is the mystery of God revealed but also the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed because remember it say the twain shall become one flesh and when God created was a part of him but there came a time when God had to take a part out of Adam and form a woman called Eve now the prophet in the message called leadership he tells us that the the kind of a woman that a man marries is a reflection of who he is how many believe that tonight if you marry a sex Queen that just shows what is on your heart now we find that this bride in this hour is the bride that was chosen by Christ himself so the condition of the Bride is a revelation of what is in Christ because Eve was just an extension that came out of Adam I want us to move along this thought and let us not forget this that a woman is an extension of a husband a woman is a revelation of who the husband is hallelujah hallelujah if you see a woman in the streets there wearing a pair of shorts it show no doubt that the father is home drunk because you can easily see by the wife the condition that is at home praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now we want to move to move forward remember I said the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed it has been the mystery of the Bride that has been hidden throughout all the ages you see the prophet tells us that when you read the word of God from Genesis to Revelations and do not find Christ go back and read it again and I want to tell you this morning that wheresoever Christ is spoken of his bride is identified there with him as Eve was identified with Adam so is the bride of Christ identified with Christ himself when you read from Genesis all the way down to Revelations and do not see your name if you are the bride of Christ go back and read it again because it's the mystery of the Bride that has been hidden throughout all the ages and now is being revealed praise God hallelujah now we are going to look at different examples where we find the the Bible showing us exactly what was going to be the Old Testament is a reflection of the New Testament is a shadow so whatsoever was there in the Old Testament is a representation of what is now hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah uh before we go in further I want to read to read a quotation from the message the marriage of the Lamb that was pre 6212 you see it says from paragraph 95 and then the ceremony and that's when the bride takes the bridegroom's name she is no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom's name in other words she becomes one with the with the groom and then when the church has the ceremony makes their promise then she takes the bridegroom's name then she is no longer a church of the world of the world she is the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ amen not I don't mean by that by name I mean that by birth by Nature the power of God by the revealed truth of God in the heart she becomes a Christian the great Universal Apostolic Church when she becomes the part of Christ when she does that Christ injects into her his own spirit and his own life the Bible said So Adam and Eve there you are no longer Twain but one and when the woman the church is married to Christ are no longer two they are one Christ in you amen and this also says here in Christ the Myster of God R he is the principal theme of the entire Bible if you read the Bible and do not see Christ in every verse of it go back and read it again see if you can see Christ in every verse in the Bible then you read it again because you missed something the Bible is Christ he is the word when you read in the beginning God created there is Christ every from that to Amen in Revelation is every word testifying of the Lord Jesus Christ now I want to take you a bit further in the same Book of Genesis as we go into the Book of Genesis chap 24 there there was a man of the name Abraham he was now old and of age hallelujah hallelujah and after a long time after he had waited for the promise of a son to finally the son came and after he had grown to to be a mature man the father thought to himself I must find myself my son's a wife but I'm not just going to find any wife because remember the type of a woman the man marries is the representation of who the man is so now Abraham calls one of his most trusted servants I am going to be to be comparing this with the bride of Christ today now he takes one of his most important servants the most trusted this reminds me of God Jesus Christ himself wanting to search for a bride but what he does now he does not just go to any Bride for a very Trusted Man by the name elaz in our day we have who is none other than the prophet William very trusted by God himself a man that never drank nor smoked nor defiled himself in any way he was surely a trusted man you realize that even Luther when he was a messenger he would smoke a pipe but it was different with elaz the level of the proph that we have received is different from any other Prophet hallelujah praise God how many believe that so now Abraham goes to elaz he says El my friend I have something that I want you to do for me but before you do this I want you to come here and take your right hand put it under my thigh now a th resembles a hidden place it's not something that you just find out there it's a hidden part of a man's body in other words abam was telling elaz come forth so that I give you the mystery of the Bride I want you to get for my life hallelujah praise God it is only a prophet who gets to see the better parts of God's life that's why even when Moses was not there when the world was created he says in the beginning but the prophet that we have went before Genesis 1 says let us examine God 400 million years before there was any creation says in his mind God got lonely and then he said in his mind let us make men in our own image it is only a prophet that can put his hand under the thigh of God himself that's why one time Moses he said to God I want to see the back parts and God showed him the back Parts he showed him the hidden things he showed him the mystery so we find him elaz being given the mystery of who the bride of Christ is supposed to be oh praise God hallelujah you glad that you are the bright tonight glory to God now he put his hand behind of Abraham he says swear to me that you will not get for my son a wife from out there go to my people people where I come from when Christ is coming for a bride he's coming for a bride with the same blood he's coming to the bride with the same nature he is not going to look for a denominational that sits under a denominational teaching that and allows women to preach but he's going to find himself a bride that is called by his name that is standing in his expressed image so now when goes Abraham gives him of the right to take any of the treasures that he had that's why in our day all the Mysteries and the Loose Ends that were left All Through the Ages Willam Mar BR was given the privilege to take all of the treasure the mystery of God and take it with him to go and find himself hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen how wonderful is our God how wonderful is this message of the hour it is filled with Mysteries the Hidden Treasures of the kingdom of God so now you find out elaz takes the wealth then he goes after he goes there he gets to a city and it's evening time hallelujah hallelujah the prophet says we are in an evening time but in the evening time they shall be praise God the bride was called by an evening message the bride was called by a sunsetting message oh hallelujah praise that's why elaz gets there the time of of dusk when the sun was going down and he makes a prayer and he says God if you I will only find favor and if you have favor to my master please give me good spe and he said in his mind in his prayer in the absence of Rebeca he said if a woman is to come here give me water and also give water to my camels she is the one I want you to notice when Rebecca came only as for water for himself he did not speak anything about the C hallelujah praise but remember it takes a bride to reveal who Christ is so a bride has got a mystery that is written in her that she can know the mind of God she can hear the unspoken part the bride was called by an unspoken part the bride was called by an unrevealed mystery it was revealed to her that Not only was he supposed to give but also he coming Hallelujah pra and Rebecca did that and elaz was convinced that's why when the prophet Comes The Mystery of the seven seal is not just revealed to anyone it is revealed in the bride it is revealed to you and to me that's why Christ had one time said to you it is given to understand of the Mysteries and of the hiden things of God so it had to take an evening PR to catch the mystery of God reminds me of Abel in the Garden of Eden it was by Revelation that he got know true worship hallelujah praise God praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God now when she she did that El was sure that this is indeed the bride hallelujah praise God oh isn't he wonderful hallelujah hallu we're going to read the quotation here praise God from the message the seventh seal paragraph 393 it says but there will be seven voices of these Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time this time so I believe to us the prophet is saying if we don't know it if it won't be known till that time but it will be revealed in that day in that hour that it's supposed to be revealed so the thing for us is to be reverent before God and to serve him and do all that we know and live good Christian lives here now we find that the Sixth Seal has been open to us we see it and we know that the seventh seal cannot be broke to the public does not say cannot be broken to the church or to the bride of Christ he says to the public it's an unspoken part just like in the time of elz when he had unspoken part the bride of Christ read between the letters as the BL of Christ will do today between the letters to find they in the Seven Seals in the seven seal the calling out of your name in the seven seal the revelation of who Jesus Christ is to us we know because it is given to us because it is by his nature that we can know his Mysteries remember he said you go to my people get for me a bride there not a denominational bride that's why the prophet was told Thou shalt not teach the spiritual things to this people to this denominational baby so this mystery is not revealed to the public but it is revealed to the bride of Christ hallelujah praise God remember we say it's the mystery of the Bride that has been hidden throughout the ages hallelujah hallelujah it is in the evening message that the bride is called Rebecca has got the ability to hear the unspoken mystery that is revealed in her hallelujah hallelujah praise God that's why you realize when you read the book of Malachi 4 says behold I sent you Elijah it does not say behold I sent you William Bren but how did we get to know that it was William Bram how did we get to know that the messenger being spoken of in Revelations in zear chter 4 is none other than the prophet it was by Revelation these things cannot be revealed to anyone else but only to the bride of Christ that's why when you were told that there is a messenger In This Very hour you did not doubt it in your heart unlike your brothers are like your sisters you believed it anyhow without even the evidence to prove it something in you told you that this is nothing but the truth and you say in your heart I am going to follow this message it's a mystery that can only be revealed to the bride of Christ hallelujah hallelujah the bride of Christ is called under a seal and it says there was silence in heaven the space of half an hour that's all there is to it but we have Malachi 4 is saying at that moment God was calling out your name and he was calling out my name in The Silence the bride is called by a silent Ser hallelujah hallelujah and he goes on to for bride that has not been tainted by denominational doctrines hallelujah hallelujah as you go on I want you to realize and find out that after they done everything and Rebecca was now supposed to come but the clothes that she put on and the Jewel that she put on she did not look for herself was given to her by because Ela is the one who knew the secret and the Mystery what the blood of Christ was supposed to be hallelujah hallelujah praise God that's why we have a prophet on the you come and tell you that you have got to be filled with the Holy Ghost or else you are not going into the that's why he had to come and tell you that without perfect love there is no rupture for you that's why he had to come and tell you that as I went beyond the C of time I saw young boys and young girls and it was told to me that some of these people you L them to Christ when they were past 8 it is the prophet of the hour who knows the mystery of what the bride of Christ is to Hallelujah praise it is given to know the kind of Rob that she must put on my brother you don't just put on any rob you don't just believe any message that's why we do not follow after T that's why we do not follow after T because that's not our garment the W garment that we put on can only be brought by because he has the mind of God praise God hallelujah huah it is only who has got the mind of God oh praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah and how do you get to put on that garment that wedding garment how do you get to put on those je it is whenever every time you sit under the preaching of the word your heart is being changed that's why it says I'll send malach you literally you literally send your hearts to the faith forefathers he is the one will come down with the mystery of the wedding garment hallelujah praise God is only who knows the mind of God notor not Billy not this Pentecostal PR but the prophet says all that you need for the Rapture is hidden in those stes and books because that's where you find that mysty garment that's when you find your nature being changed being made to look like that of Isaac oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen how many believe it tonight that as you listening to the tapes you are putting on the Garment glory to God now we go into the Book of Ruth the greatest love story and we realize how the book ofu starts it says and there was a fine in the Land There was a fine in the land the prophet explains it says it was not just a femine of but it was also a femine of the word of God the bride is called tonight in the time ofine when the word of God is casted when this poop is no longer preach the word of God men's ideas hallelujah hallelujah that's why you find Ruth it starts with end there was a femine in the land hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when we go into the message Jezebel religion paragraph 100 it says when God sends forth a message and tells the people and they don't believe it then he withdraws his servant and sends his death spiritually speaking physically also you watch for a depression brother watch for a depression brother you think you have seen something you just wait after a while you haven't seen nothing you think you are dying for good spiritual Revival you wait till after a little bit you just can't wait long and cry to hear the word of God the Bible said so there will be a femine in the last days said the prophet not for bread and water alone but for hearing of the true word of God but that will that voice will be quiet in the wilderness hiding somewhere away hallelujah hallelujah that's why in the desert of Kentucky the message of the hour somewhere and it was a time of drought it was there was femine in the Land There was in great need for the word to be restored that's the time the bride is called in the time of feminine H hallelujah praise now we find that there was a Ruth Ruth is a Fel word what does five stand for five stand for Grace five is the number of Grace is called under grace because by right she was not supposed to be a part of the children of Israel because he was a gentile but it's by Grace it's by Naomi that Ruth comes into the sea hallelujah it's by grace that the Bride of Christ comes into the seene oh hallelujah praise God praise God Amen now Ruth she did not know anything about there being a Kingsman Redeemer but it was Nomi who had the secret who had seen the B parts of God's mind was Naomi who knew that they back home was a messenger he knew that back home there was a Kingman Redeemer Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the mystery of redemption of was held by Naomi the same way the mystery of the Redemption of Rebecca was held by El is the mystery of the Bride that has been hid throughout all the we are reading now we find that it is exactly a reflection of what the bread of Christ Jes hallelujah hallelujah now Naomi tried to tell them to go back after they had walked with her for some that's why the prophet tells us that the Lutheran yes they walked with him but they got to a certain point when they denominated and like they returned back to that mother of churches where they had come from hallelujah hallelujah the bride of Christ was there the same time with her she did not go back she said I will not go back I will go with the there I will also go where thou sleepest there I will also sleep you see the tells us an explain says when Copus and theop cop and theopus and theopus theopus were going they were speaking about Christ right there he appeared but they go to a certain place and the prophet says Christ likes to do this he likes to act as though he's passing by he's just waiting for you to invite and it says that's the greatest decision that they made when they invited him in hallelujah praise godu hallelujah hallelujah because God will test you on your profession on your testimony you say you are the bride of Christ you say I'm picking up my cross to follow Christ say liketh and Naomi we are going with you but there sometime God will throw a pit there to see what you will do if you are the true bride of Christ you will say like Ruth whe thou goest I will go whe thouest I willu went on to say something say where you die I will also die that's the problem with the bright T the bride does not want to die to their Human Nature what the bride needs is a dying out and she says where you will be buried where will I be buried where are we buried bride of Christ we are buried in Christ where do we die we die in Christ so Ruth quot the Revelation that for me to go with Naomi I have got to die to my selfish that's why we read in the book of second Peter say put on these virtues virtues can only come my brother when you die out yourself when you are still in your human nature there is no perfect love when you're still in your human nature there's no brotherly kindness so you got to die for you to be identified with with him had to die to be identified with Naomi Oh Glory to God like the Methodist they denominated and they went back like but Ruth like Peter where else can we go Lord you alone have got the out there there is nothing else but David says the rock where I stand That Rock of Ages the ground out there sinking there is only one place where you can stand is when you are buried under that rock was saying I want to be buried under that Ro Naomi Grace Naomi represents Grace hallelujah hallelujah but truth was steast and then Naomi let come hallelujah hallelujah and I want you to watch the season in which Ruth came the season in which Ruth was called it says now Naomi heard that the Lord remembered his people and had given them Harvest and given them bread and had given them B what does bread and b stand for for the word of God so when she was there the denomination day she heard that God had restored the word she that there was a Malachi 4 in the land she that there was a revelation 10 in the and she purpos in that I am going the bride is called time of restoration hallelujah praise God that's why there is a message restoration of the Bride that is when the bride is called restoration seal the Bride Comes now and becomes a part of Naomi a part of Christ in the time where the B the bread has been restored in the hallelujah praise God represents the word b represents the word and who brings the word it than the prophet because the prophet carries the mind of God hallelujah hallelujah and she say in heart I'm going to go back to Bethlehem Bethlehem what does it mean means the house of God's BL she purp in heart that I am going to seek under theor of Mal that house of God's bread I will and I will die out and I will give my life until I become like him oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah in the message the kingsman Redeemer paragraph 122 the prophet says Naomi and Ruth come in just at B season bar season was bread season the season when fresh bread was being served it says fresh bread that's why we don't believe the gospel of L that's why we don't follow after this that's why we follow a fresh kill because the anointing that we are under is an eagle anointing and an eagle can only feast on a fresh kill that's why our gospel is not a gospel of yesterday but it's the message of the hour hallelujah hallelujah it's the message of the hour it's a message of the now where you have fresh bread and fresh manner restored in the hallelujah praise God so there was fresh man the bride can only come after fresh manner the bride cannot be drawn by false doctrines and teachings the bride cannot be drawn by Miracles although they are good but today it's the revelation of the word that callus the bride because it was in a season when there was fresh bread when God had remembered his people and decided to rest hallelujah hallelujah says in the last days through 2,000 years of pagan teachings and things has come in at bar season the freshness of Life new bread honey Out of Heaven that's why we believe that this message of the hour is not a men's Doctrine this message of the hour has got a man who says I've come sent from the presence of God it's fresh bread and honey coming straight from the Throne of God it's not a men's doct brother it's not a man's teaching because we cannot take stale food we can only take fresh bread the Throne of God hallelujah hallelujah say talk about hyr bread this is it bread from Heaven I am the bread of life fathers did eat mana and are dead and are dead but I am the bread of life that comes from Heaven If any man eats this bread he will never die and the church in this last day here is brought in right now at Bary season we are called back at a season when God has remembered his people and God is restoring the bre people it's the mystery of the Bride the bride revealing Christ the bride being called in a time ofine but God has restored that's why he said he shall restore your heart back to your Pentecostal fathers hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen the kingsman Redeemer was of the tribe of Judah now who else can be of the tribe of Judah except for the Lord Jesus you see Hallelujah now you have Boaz representing Christ now Boaz I want you to notice something Boaz is a fourl name what does number four represent the number four represents Deliverance the number four represents Redemption because when you read the book of the word of God you will find out that is had been caught and put in Siege Hallelujah but there were four lepers that were sitting at outside of the gate that purp in theirs that purpose in their hearts said we are going to go if we perish we perish that's the attitude that the CH myself that's God we are giving and fully in our Liv if we perish we perish and also the number four reminds me of the fourth men in the fire those three men were thrown in the fire Deliverance came ring on the number four Deliverance came riding on the number four praise God hallelujah glory to God now here we find Redemption coming ring the number four is a fouret name he was a Kingsman Redeemer representing Redemption oh hallelujah oh hallelujah praise God and it was revealed to truth who Boaz was and how to get his attention hallelujah hallelujah praise God it has got to be revealed to the bride who your Kingsman redeemer is and how do you draw his attention you can only draw the attention of the kingsman Redeemer if like Ruth you stayed true to the word because after the death of her husband Ruth stayed true to Naomi and when Bo heard about all thatth had done then his attention was when you bride of Christ hold on to the go of Christ and put away the law of the first husband which is your human nature hallelujah hallelujah you will draw the attention of the kingsman Redeemer praise God Amen now Ruth goes to GLE and pick up you know food food in the in in the in the garden of uh in the field of Boaz hallelujah hallelujah she gleed after the Reapers personally I would like to believe that there were only seven rippers there were there were seven rppers and Ruth representing the bride was gleaning after in other words she was following after the messenger of the first church age there was a Ruth in a day that followed after Paul to the seventh Church age there is a Ruth tonight following behind the reaper which is none other than Malachi 4 praise God Amen so she was following picking up the food it is only when you follow the messenger and you follow Christ that is the only time when you get to Feast of the food that is at the table of God so CAU the mystery I have got to follow after this of I've got to follow his sermons I've got to listen to Faith is the subance I have got to listen to the spoken word the original I have got to listen to Jezebel religion I have got to listen to indictment to indictment indictment I've got to listen to all those so that I can have food in a time of praise God hallelujah praise God now when Bo asked who is this fine woman I can see by the way that she is dressed she dresses different she walks different she has shamefacedness she does not speak above a husband this woman does not speak above Naomi she listens to every word that Naomi says who is this woman it was the seventh messenger the seventh that gave him the information of who that truth was is the messenger of the hour who carries your identity of who you really are and he will present you before Christ Christ your without SP wrinkle without blemish hallelujah hallelujah praise God in verse eight of Ruth you find out that goes to Ruth and tells Ruth do not go out there gleaning from other fields you are just supposed to pick food from here and here alone bride of Christ don't go to those false teachings to take your spiritual food there get your spiritual food only in this field of B that's the only place where there is spiritual food for you the food hallelujah hallelujah CA you to have eups TOS it Willa you TOS all this other food make you to have hicup spiritually you start believing funny things and later before you know it brother comes on and there's no interpretation there it's a false teaching it's a false Doctrine but where did you get it from the other field from the field of Billy those denominational preachers cannot give you spiritual f that's why Ruth you have got only to G from this field you have got only to take your spiritual food here that's the only place and when you begin to take your spiritual food himself will tell his servants drop a little bit more than you dropped yesterday drop a little bit more Revelation than you dropped yesterday Tru is following Now The Messengers they start to drop secrets that cannot be heard understood by a denominational being but only Ruth to have the privilege following and getting of the extra man getting of the extra oil the field of when you follow that you begin to understand m is when you follow daily that you get to understand what was hidden in that pyramid is when you follow that's when you get to understand what was written in that unrated language it is when you follow that you get to realize that it was not just a cloud but it was Christ coming down the SE it is only when you follow that you get to realize that it was not just a sword but it was a sword of the king it is when you follow that you get to understand what was there in the T pool what represent and what what was it speaking about the prophet said nothing about it you when you follow that's when you get extra B that's when you get extra man you when you follow that's when you get the hidden man that's you get to stand on the sacred s and understand the mystery of God will you get to understand the Myst of is your kman redeemer is the bride mystery being hidden through all the ages now being revealed hallelujah hallelujah praise God oh that ought to make someone shout that to make someone jump out of their seat and say oh thank you Jesus I have become a Believer this message of the hour say oh thank you Lord I have been following from 1947 1965 I am following each day oh praise hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah now boas was told how Ruth stuck to Naomi after the death of her first husband Hallelujah when you read the Bible in the Book of Romans chapter 7 Romans chapter 7 in First Corinthians chapter 7 I love this verses and I love how just God lines it hallelujah hallelujah you realize that the law of the first husband is spoken of in the seventh chapter I want you to get this it is spoken in the seventh chapter of Romans in the seventh chapter of First Corinthians question is why seven remember that woman at the well when she went to the well and met with Jesus he told her go and get your husband she said I have no husband said you have answered correctly you have five and the one that you living with the sixth one is not but six is an incomplete number there's got to be a seventh husband somewhere that's why we find the law of the first husband dies on the seventh child when the seventh husband comes on the seene hallelujah praise God Jesus Christ was the seventh husband he says once you become part of this husband you will not test anymore after all these other husbands there were six Cities of Refuge six incomplete number there's got to be a seven City somewhere seven City somewhere says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runto thee sa we have a safe house tonight M Zion we have a seventh husband tonight the Lord Jesus Christ we have the seventh City the Lord Jesus Christ when you die to the law of your first husband then you get the privilege to partake of the wealth of the seventh husband that's why church when you are not yet dead to yourself forget about the mysteries of God forget about the hidden thoughts of God because you are no part of it it is only when you die to your first husband that the message is brought to and say this woman you see she stuck with Ruth this woman you see she would not raise a voice this woman you see when the pastors are preaching she's not saying in there are men just like me what to they know she is believing the word and she is staying with the word then you get to to understand the mystery of the seventh husband hallelujah hallelujah and Ruth was told to stay with the young men in the field of Boaz until the end of the Harvest Redemption my brother comes at the end of the Harvest Revelations 10 and it says but in the days of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished it is the end of the Harvest Hallelujah that you are redeemed back that you are brought back in chapter in verse it will tell you that time shall be no more time shall be no more and here is saying at the end of the Harvest continue following this young man continue following the teaching of you following the teaching of the Bible until the end of time and when you do that Ruth then you are redeemed and when you do that then you are one with your husband and when you do that then the MST of Christ hiden in you is revealed before the world until when people look at you they can see Christ they can see Christ in you because you are a revelation of who Christ is for you to get there you have got to stay with the message of the hour until the end of time praise God hallelujah glory to God Ruth was to stay with young men until the end of the Harvest until the end of the seven Church ages becoming of Christ the seventh seal Ruth is in the third chapter in the third chapter and chapter of Ruth and in Matthew 25 you hear of another bride that bride was a mixed a mixed Church five wise five wise and five foolish but of the 10 the five who were wise stayed with the word stayed with the oil the end of the time when the Midnight Cry went out behold the bright coming it is because they stayed with the word Until the End of Time the end of the and then they entered in but don't be like the foolish virgin who will follow but as soon as they get the money that they were praying for they will backslide and go into the world after they get the job that they were asking for slide and go into the world you have got to stay my brother stay at the threshing floor stay there in prayer stay there in fasting stay there in eating the W until the

dreed and clear the end of the world oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God you've got to stay with the word praise God hallelujah we are going to read a quotation from the message the Rapture that was preached by the prophet 1965 124 12 of May 12th of April yeah that's when it was preached it says here she was the word they looked like one out of every nation he speaking about the bride this is the preview of the Bride when God gave the prophet the privilege to see what the bride looks like she was the word she was Christ because the word is Christ and you being here tonight you are revealing who Christ was so the bride of Christ was revealing Christ that's why he says she was the word they looked like one from every nation there were some brothers from Uganda there were some brothers from Zimbabwe there were some brothers from Kenya but there were one bride it says I was looking as they passed by and seen them pass by but instead of going down see all these other Brides after they would mat and match and go meing wearing tiny skirts with [Applause] B with their faces looking like peacocks painted faces Jezebel wearing hog nailed shoes Where Angels Fear to tr they would go meing

always asked myself why the F of all places why go to the head because the head of the body is Christ the bride has got to know a place the bride has got to know a place you women must know their

the sh of B was n than himself glory to God you labor with Christ don't worry the seven ship is coming your sth husband is coming Jesus Christ is on the way oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah I have so many quotations here but I'm just going to skip some of them now we get into the Book of Esther I love the book of es It's a Wonderful book it's a book that was written in such a time as this when the children of God had been taken captive like some children of God tonight from generational Spirit from generational Spirits captive spirit of pornography under captive from the spirits of hollyood that's the time comes on the SC of Christ not perhaps you perhaps you were called for such a time as this the book of es starts with a feast s day Feast Hallelujah it the Myster of the Bride start with the seven Church ages a seven day feast it's a seven day Feast the seven Church ages start with the Myster of the bride of Christ hallelujah hallelujah and in the seventh day God decides to show for his bride the seventh age that God decides to take his Bri by the and walk with the sth day that King to take the bride F to the world don't you know brother sister that all creation wait eagly the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God the church age seventh day of the feast King decides let me bring my queen show him for before the world let me bring my bride and take before the Luan doct take before the oness before the meod look at Bri that's my sweee the bride Hallelujah has got to be shown forth to R the mystery of Christ day decid and I want you to look at this he had seven men seven princes that attended to the king and we told in the Book of Revelations that there are seven stars in the right hand of God there are seven of them but when calls them he called them to do one man's job but all of them were supposed to do the same thing he calls all seven of them he says go and call my wife God call Seven Messengers to go and call out one wife go and call out one wife seven prin a duty go and look for a bride Brides but one bride and they came and they went and called a queen V queen V nowen and the same time that the king decides to throw a party she also decides to throw a party what an example of the women of today who do not submit themselves under their husbands because how can you when the King has called for a and she calls all the women why was she calling them to have a meeting on civil rights to have a meeting on women's rights to tell them what this men can do we also can do to tell them we do not need M we have money we are okay that's the doctrine that V was spreading that's the false doct the Jezebel religion is spreading they have an uprising for churches to have an uprising against King Jesus that's what she was calling them for she says come women let us discuss this calling our husbands my Lord that is backward let's together talk of of cooking for husbands they also have hands they can cook for that's the doct had called the women for at the same time when you have the bride of Christ you have the Antichrist on the scene you the true SE of God you have a false seed when you have a True Vine you have a false vine when you haveing call you haveen youen jeel for at the very same time hallelujah hallelujah those prin came the king requires their presence he says can the king see that I'm busy can you see that I'm busy with can you see that I'm in a business meeting that was the spirit of V that was the spirit of Jezebel the spirit of Jezebel did not the spirit of Jezebel started back Genesis there that's when started thought that I can do without an Adam and she took a walk in the garden away from then she met the serent find The Jezebel spirit then she was defiled she committed fornications the Jezebel spirit the spirit of fornications with false teaching and anointed by jeze says I listen to my husband that's what we have tonight praise God Church where men with beard men with beard they sit in the benches and these women with stilos faces and long nails that they cannot even eat food with their hands they come say hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah raising those painted nails the spirit that was upon that's the spirit in the church today even in the message of the hour you find wives who do not respect their husbands because she ears more money than him because she's more UC than about to be replaced you are about to be replaced so in verse 10 all the princes seven of them from Paul Willam the seventh Angel's message pronounces the Judgment now of the prin there was a seventh prince who name was mean and when you read mean is a seven letter name and the prophet says never from Abraham did God ever call and use a man with seven letters except in the seven Church except the seventh messenger name was who really represents William who has seven letter names in the seventh age on the seventh day of the feast she will come and preach the message Indi and give judgment to that Jezebel religion and say judgment struck the West Coast it's the message of mean that brings about the Judgment of jeel that brings about the Judgment of that foolish woman some them can stood up said King you know if we let this go all the women are going to take example and there's going to be an uprising and women shall rule over us she says it is better now that you replace her another in hallelujah hallelujah praise God with another in state praise God hallelujah hallelujah so the message shows that in prison now glory to God from paragra 300 it says oh listen all those who rejected the message of the hour before doomed gospel was preached to the doomed before they went without Mery without Mercy Mercy no shut up was a testimony God shut the door after his PO after the third po at Sodom the door was shut there was no Morey the 10 couldn't be found and the L the gospel preached that could not be saved because it was just being that way in every age every age reject the messenger before the judgments that's why we have a m who comes on the scene and has got books that are open and say you Roman Catholic Church you refused to turn away from trinitarian do you are doomed never to be used by God anymore that's what happened in the book of hallelujah hallelujah praise God when came on the scene it says replace her and now they took comes on the scene and is given again to a guy five name Naomi five letter name we see Grace Grace Grace gra we see Christ Christ Christ bride bride Whenever there is Grace there is a bride represented Whenever there is a Christ there is a bride represent now guy looks at es and she finds favor faor in his sight and all these women were given things to purify themselves and they would go and say give me makeup give me uniformi to wear like the Methodist so that I can be seen by the King give me a lot of lipstick so that I can go and entice the king shoes so that I can go and entice the king perhaps that's what the king wants perhaps the king is going to see my figure is going to want me the king is going to see my he going to want me my brother that's not what we are after we are not after yellow legs we are not after your figure we are after that soul that is come back to Christ so these women would go and ask for makeup the guy would give them give them what they wanted says they were given they are seducing spirit in the last day they will be given seducing Spirits because they've become of pleasure more than lovers of God God will permit them to use makeup God will perm them to paint their lips God will permit them to walk with breast outside they want to prfe the whole world permit them to walk with legs outside if we wanted legs we would go and get chicken legs at we would go and get chicken legs not your legs my sister properly properly before you come here to sing a special song don't dress in that Dr look like you poured into it be like those women that went and ask for that and ask for snakes and those skin tights and t-shirts to walk before the king but the King was noted because he had seen that before he had seen that in jeze and knew that any woman who dresses like this will against your husband every woman who dresses like this does not have the spirit of submission every woman who dresses like this will go and vote for equal rights give you that that's why he was not touched you dismiss them I'm used to this seen this before I don't like this are you are naked before me that's why God says Thou Art naked blind in the wor part of it you know with it not you think that is righteousness to come with your knees outside Church to the judgment is at the door judgment is knocking repent come back to the Cross you sisters who speak back to their husbands come back to the Cross come back to Calvary stay in line hallelujah hallelujah so the king would dismiss them go away go away go away go away I want something different that's why God did not take the denomination of that's why God in the prev of the Bride take the Ang Pride did not take the Methodist bride did not take the calvinist bride but he took the Jesus bride took the word she was clothed in the word and all the women would go and ask for things butto es because was true true to the Lord Jesus Christ she was true to a guy she listened to the instructions of the guy appointed to seven maidens we see in the book of second Peter 5 Seven Virtues when you continue to listen to a guy he will come and give you patience he will come and give you peace long suffering all seven V they were given to es because she stood by a guy listened to a guy she did not mix a doct of devil hallelujah hallelujah bride of Christ if you do not mix the do with the do of devils you will receive the S virtues he Reed The Seven Virtues the prophet calls them seven steps Perfection seven steps to the Chamber of the king would take a step the first virt she would walk in the virtues she was getting closer to King she was getting closer and closer to the image that King was looking for step by step step by step walking into she was stepping a lady stepping like the bride of Christ stepping on
