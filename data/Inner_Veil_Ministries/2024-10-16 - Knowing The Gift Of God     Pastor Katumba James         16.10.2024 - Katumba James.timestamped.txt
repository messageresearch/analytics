[25:06] M and we believe Lord you are here in

[25:19] needs before

[25:30] Lord and bless us together
[25:34] Lord in the name of Jesus
[25:37] Christ amen amen I greet in the name of
[25:40] our Lord Jesus
[25:42] Christ I'm sorry I came a little bit
[25:45] late praise the name of the Lord let us
[25:49] go to John
[25:53] 4 John
[26:02] and then we starting from verse
[26:08] 9 the Bible
[26:12] says then say the woman of Samaria unto
[26:16] him how is it that thou being a Jew ask
[26:20] drink of me which I'm a woman of Samaria
[26:24] for the Jews have no dealings with the
[26:26] Samaritans a
[26:44] Jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[26:47] knowest the gift of God and who it is
[26:50] that says to thee give me to drink thou
[26:54] do have asked of him and he would have
[26:56] given thee Li
[27:14] says unto him sir thou Hast nothing to
[27:17] draw with and the well is deep from when
[27:20] then thou Hast that Living Water
[27:37] may God bless of his
[27:39] word we may be
[27:45] seated I've seen our sister from sister
[27:48] Faith is
[27:55] it so I want to preach on knowing the
[27:59] gift of
[28:04] God praise the name of our Lord knowing
[28:07] the gift of
[28:10] God so now the Lord Jesus
[28:14] Christ he met this woman at the
[28:19] well the woman found Christ sitting
[28:22] there at
[28:25] the praise the name of our Lord
[28:28] and then you know how brother Bram tells
[28:34] us and said that Jesus was contacting
[28:37] her
[28:41] spirit that's why he started talking to
[28:44] her you know from a common
[28:50] ground give me some water to
[28:53] drink you know because Jesus was already
[28:56] there
[28:58] and then he wanted to get the attention
[29:00] of this
[29:04] woman and then she starts giving
[29:08] reason that we have no
[29:12] dealings the Samaritans and the
[29:17] Jews and then Jesus draws her
[29:23] attention that it's not only the drink
[29:26] is asking her to give him
[29:31] but he wanted her to know the gift of
[29:37] God and that gift of
[29:40] God was Christ
[29:43] himself praise the name of the Lord say
[29:47] if you can know the gift of
[29:53] God praise the name of our Lord you
[29:56] would have asked him
[29:59] and he would have given you living
[30:05] water praise the name of the
[30:09] Lord now we see that this
[30:16] scenario that when Christ kept on
[30:19] talking to the
[30:22] woman then he was able to know what her
[30:25] problem was
[30:28] and then her problem was about unclean
[30:35] living she was living in
[30:41] immorality and then he starts that can
[30:43] you bring your
[30:47] husband don't
[30:49] have but then she was living with man
[30:52] there at
[30:54] home and then you know when Christ
[30:58] kept on you know desending father her
[31:05] life the woman was awakened
[31:12] spiritually and then she started talking
[31:14] about
[31:16] worship and then said that you know tell
[31:19] us that we should come and worship at
[31:26] Jerusalem
[31:30] Jem praise the name of our Lord now
[31:34] Christ was revealing the gift of
[31:39] God to the
[31:41] woman until it draw the attention of the
[31:47] woman toire
[31:51] toship to desire living
[31:55] water and then she said I you are a
[32:00] prophet and when the Messiah
[32:03] cometh he will tell us this things and
[32:07] then Jesus declares to
[32:10] her I am
[32:13] he praise the name of the Lord and then
[32:16] she was able to get into true
[32:20] worship praise the name of the Lord even
[32:24] as if we can get to know the gift of God
[32:29] what God has given to
[32:32] us then we shall be blessed by the gift
[32:35] of
[32:38] God prise the name of the Lord and
[32:41] brother tells
[32:43] us approach to the gift of
[32:47] God you towards the gift of
[32:52] God will either bless
[32:55] you praise the name of our Lord it will
[32:58] bless
[32:59] you so now even us we need to recognize
[33:04] the gift of
[33:06] God that God has given to
[33:09] us and then that's how we shall be
[33:16] blessed when we know the gift of
[33:19] God we shall be blessed by
[33:23] God using that
[33:26] gift praise the name of
[33:28] you know when Jesus was before the
[33:32] people when Jesus was before the
[33:36] people you know the Pharisees
[33:39] came and then they were asking
[33:42] him who who gave you that
[33:46] power they were not
[33:49] blessed they were not
[33:52] blessed praise the name of our Lord but
[33:54] when the publicans came
[33:58] you know they were
[34:01] repenting they were turning away from
[34:03] their evil
[34:06] ways the same thing when they come to
[34:08] John the
[34:11] Baptist when they come to John the
[34:17] Baptist
[34:20] the the
[34:22] Sinners they were asking John what shall
[34:25] we do
[34:28] praise the name of our Lord and then he
[34:30] was telling them what they should
[34:35] do and when they were
[34:37] obedient they were blessed by the gift
[34:40] of
[34:41] God but when the priests came to
[34:46] John when the phes came to
[34:49] John they were asking him who are
[34:53] you praise the name of our Lord and they
[34:56] were not blessed
[34:59] praise the name of our Lord so now we
[35:01] need to see that we have a right
[35:03] approach to the gift of
[35:10] God praise the name of our Lord must the
[35:13] right approach to the gift of
[35:17] God if we are going to be blessed by the
[35:20] gift of
[35:23] God and we must have faith
[35:28] that you know that gift will bless
[35:31] us brother
[35:33] Bram was a gift to our
[35:40] age was a gift to the
[35:48] age when
[35:52] brother the angel told
[35:55] him when if the people believe
[35:59] you in words if they accept
[36:04] you if they believe what you are telling
[36:08] them there is nothing going to stand
[36:10] between you and
[36:14] cancer and that is also the same thing
[36:17] also to
[36:19] us that any gift that God gives to
[36:23] us we need to believe that gift
[36:29] praise the name of our Lord God gave us
[36:34] Christ as a gift to the
[36:37] world to give us eternal
[36:40] life praise the name of the Lord if you
[36:43] don't believe
[36:45] Christ you can't have eternal
[36:48] life praise the name of the Lord so if
[36:51] we are going to be blessed by the gift
[36:53] of Christ
[36:57] then we need to believe that
[37:01] gift we need to accept that
[37:05] gift we need to obey that
[37:09] gift praise the name of our Lord the
[37:12] Holy Ghost is a gift that is given to
[37:15] the
[37:19] church to guide
[37:22] us to teach us to comfort
[37:26] us EMP power
[37:28] us to tutor
[37:31] us as long as we are able to believe
[37:35] that
[37:37] gift as long as we able to know that
[37:41] gift a personal relationship with the
[37:44] Holy
[37:48] Ghost then the purpose of the holy
[37:54] spirit will be fulfilled in our lives
[37:59] praise the name of our the fivefold
[38:03] ministry are gifts to the body of Jesus
[38:08] Christ that God has given to
[38:11] us so if we can receive the fivefold
[38:19] ministry then we shall be blessed of the
[38:23] lord we shall be positionally placed in
[38:26] our position
[38:29] and then we shall not have that thing of
[38:31] running up and
[38:33] down you know running from this church
[38:35] to the other
[38:37] Church you are running with this again
[38:43] anotherr praise the name of the Lord and

[39:07] saying let me leave this church
[39:10] now evangelist

[39:31] home praise the name of
[39:37] Lord praise the name of the Lord you
[39:40] know children are not raised from the
[39:41] neighbor
[39:47] home I've taken long without eating meat
[39:49] then I go to my
[39:54] neighbor you don't know what is prepared
[39:56] there
[39:59] praise the name of our Lord but the gift
[40:02] will find us
[40:04] here praise the name of our Lord because
[40:08] you have an
[40:10] overseer praise the name of our Lord
[40:13] gift of that God has given to
[40:17] us to raise us to shepher us to feed us
[40:24] so he oversees every spirit that comes
[40:30] with praise the name of our Lord when
[40:32] you go
[40:34] AR when you go to some of those
[40:39] places the P may not know what you're
[40:41] going to feed
[40:43] on praise the name of the Lord and then
[40:46] you may find that you are eating maybe
[40:48] wild
[40:53] GS there's that in second Kings chapter
[40:56] 2 second Kings chapter
[41:01] 4 praise the name of our
[41:05] Lord let us go to the book of Second
[41:11] Kings Second
[41:14] Kings and then we going
[41:18] reading in
[41:22] chapter beg your pardon Second Kings
[41:33] let us go the book of second Kings
[41:35] chapter
[41:43] 2 and then we read in
[41:51] verse I beg your pardon so the sons of
[41:55] the Prophet had going to get to go and
[41:58] get food from the
[42:03] field and now they L the spirit of
[42:09] discernment so they were they were able
[42:11] to get GS because they were
[42:19] hungry and then they cooked
[42:22] it and they found that there was poison
[42:26] in the pot
[42:31] and then they cry to the
[42:34] prophet oh there's death in the
[42:38] pot praise the name of our Lord so we
[42:41] need to see that we recognize the gift
[42:44] that God has given to
[42:49] us praise the name of our and receive
[42:52] the
[42:54] gift the Bible says that receives a
[43:01] prophet in the name of the
[43:04] Prophet receives the prophet's
[43:08] blessing he that receives a righteous
[43:13] man in the name of a righteous
[43:17] man receives a righteous
[43:21] man and that's the same thing about all
[43:24] the gifts of God
[43:29] when the woman at the
[43:32] well when she recognized the gift of
[43:36] Christ and then he said oh give me to
[43:39] drink of that Living
[43:42] Water you know she desired
[43:45] Christ until when Christ revealed her
[43:50] life she said you are a
[43:54] prophet so she was blessed by the gift
[43:57] of Jesus
[44:00] Christ but now when the Pharisees
[44:03] criticize that
[44:05] gift when thees rejected that
[44:10] gift they will not be able to be blessed
[44:13] by the
[44:16] gift praise the name of our Lord now in
[44:19] the message it shall be even as it was
[44:22] told me
[44:27] he
[44:28] says looking around over the
[44:32] city and seeing the
[44:34] conditions walking in the
[44:37] city and
[44:40] see many of the people go
[44:44] out this gift is a
[44:50] pioneering it must go into
[44:54] places it must bring for
[44:59] there will be people who will follow me
[45:01] in
[45:03] here gopel
[45:06] ministers and so forth with
[45:10] revivals but
[45:12] first before you can get the
[45:16] people there's got to be a Godly
[45:19] demonstration of something to pull the
[45:21] people
[45:28] to let them
[45:30] recognize that it is the
[45:33] truth that is right and now
[45:37] notice the meetings are glorious and
[45:42] wonderful and I love you
[45:44] all gifts must be
[45:48] confirmed anyone can say anything they
[45:51] wish
[45:53] to and they can have impressions
[46:00] but when God really sent
[46:05] something he will vindicate that to be
[46:08] the
[46:10] truth God will speak of
[46:13] it the Bible said in
[46:17] Hebrews God testifying of his
[46:22] gifts Hebrews 11
[46:27] the is that right God
[46:33] testifying then you got God's
[46:40] testimony the holy spirit is the gift of
[46:45] God you believe it when he comes to you
[46:50] he will
[46:52] testify that it is there
[46:57] all God's gifts
[47:01] testify it isn't nothing you try to
[47:12] make work you got to be
[47:18] positive now a confirmation of the
[47:20] presence of God is that he's here
[47:23] through the word
[47:28] then he's here through the
[47:32] gifts now
[47:34] notice they work and how they are
[47:40] confirmed then he says quickly I shall
[47:45] hurry quickly
[47:46] now and your faith is getting real
[47:52] high I believe just about as high as I
[47:55] can see faith
[48:00] the thing you need now is to let your
[48:03] faith
[48:13] lose but what you you you you are
[48:18] wondering is to get up here on the
[48:23] platform seeing those people healed here
[48:28] but if you just turn
[48:32] yourself your faith
[48:35] lose out there where you
[48:38] are it will be just the same where you
[48:44] are it is your faith
[48:48] anyhow it is your
[48:50] faith only faith is the way to get it
[48:54] from God anything
[48:59] you get
[49:01] salvation
[49:03] forgiveness
[49:05] anything comes from God through
[49:10] faith you believe it you accept
[49:14] it praise the name of our so now when
[49:18] God sends us a
[49:21] gift we must have faith in that
[49:25] gift this gift is going to help
[49:29] me praise the name of the Lord but if
[49:32] you don't have faith in the gift of
[49:37] God there is no way the gift of God is
[49:40] going to help
[49:42] you praise the name of the Lord and this
[49:45] is how God wants us to
[49:49] relate with whatever gift he puts in our
[49:54] midst praise the name of our Lord and
[49:57] being part of the body of Jesus
[50:00] Christ we all have various
[50:05] gifts praise the name of our Lord so you
[50:08] must
[50:10] believe that one whose gift is going to
[50:12] bless
[50:14] you you must believe that the other
[50:17] one's gift is going to benefit
[50:21] you praise the name of our Lord and this
[50:24] is how the body can really grow
[50:29] up recognizing the gift that God has put
[50:32] in our
[50:36] mid and then cherishing this
[50:39] gift praise the name of our Lord so now
[50:42] as we have been saying the fivefold
[50:45] ministry is a gift to the
[50:51] [Music]
[50:52] body a pastor is a gift to the church
[50:57] praise the name of our and then now in
[51:01] your
[51:03] family praise the name of our Lord your
[51:06] wife is a gift to
[51:11] you even your husband is a gift to
[51:15] you and each of them have got their
[51:20] positions a wife is a gift to the
[51:23] husband
[51:26] as a
[51:28] helpmate and then a husband is a gift to
[51:31] the
[51:34] wife as the
[51:36] head praise the name of our Lord then
[51:40] the
[51:41] parents are gifts to the
[51:45] children to raise
[51:47] them to nurture
[51:50] them to provide for
[51:53] them to guide them
[51:56] and so you find that each and every one
[51:59] of
[52:00] us we have been blessed by various
[52:05] gifts praise the name of our Lord church
[52:08] we are blessed with the
[52:11] pastor when we go home we are blessed
[52:15] with our
[52:18] families even as
[52:20] parents your children are a gift to
[52:25] you praise the name of our Lord there
[52:27] are gifts to you and now if God has
[52:30] given us a
[52:32] gift you need to cherish the gift that
[52:35] God has given
[52:38] you we need to embrace the gifts that
[52:41] God has given to
[52:44] us praise the name of our Lord God has
[52:48] given you
[52:50] children he gives them to you to bring
[52:53] your Generations
[52:58] you know they are they your
[53:03] Generations you know your generation is
[53:06] passing through
[53:08] that the Bible says that the book of the
[53:11] generation
[53:17] of let us go to Genesis 5 verse1
[53:27] the Bible says this is the book of the
[53:30] generations of Adam in the day that God
[53:33] created man in the likeness of of God
[53:36] made
[53:46] him so then he starts mentioning all the
[53:49] people that came
[53:53] from a generation
[53:57] praise the name of our Lord you bringing
[54:01] offsprings you know and then they go to
[54:04] Future
[54:07] Generations so children are a gift to a
[54:13] family praise the name of our Lord so
[54:15] you need to see that you cherish
[54:17] whatever gift that God has given to
[54:22] us and then even us as members of the
[54:25] body of Christ
[54:29] we are a gift one to
[54:33] another every one of us is a gift to
[54:37] another
[54:40] person as the body of
[54:43] Christ if we are
[54:45] members we are a gift to one
[54:51] [Music]
[54:54] another praise the name of our Lord so
[54:56] there is a way we can bless one
[55:00] another and now in the
[55:03] body we have various
[55:07] gifts praise the name of the Lord and
[55:10] even these gifts that we
[55:12] have are of different
[55:17] measures praise the name of our Lord we
[55:20] may have the same
[55:22] gift but the measure is different
[55:27] based on the grace that God has given to
[55:33] us the Bible says he gave some five
[55:39] talents and then another two
[55:43] talents based on their several
[55:48] abilities praise the name of the Lord so
[55:51] if God has given you a small measure
[55:57] don't despise that small
[56:01] measure and then you go and bury
[56:04] it but you know use that small measure
[56:07] God has given
[56:11] you that you can build the kingdom of
[56:17] God let us go to MTH
[56:24] 25:4 the Bible says
[56:27] for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man
[56:29] traveling into a country who called his
[56:32] own servants and delivered unto them his
[56:37] Goods Matthew
[56:43] [Music]
[56:51] [Music]
[56:53] 25:14 so the Bible says he delivered
[56:56] them to them his
[57:01] Goods so each of us we have been there
[57:04] are Goods that God has delivered to
[57:11] us he has gifted Us in various
[57:17] ways so whatever he has delivered with
[57:22] us he wants us to use it to establish
[57:26] his
[57:28] Kingdom praise the name of at your place
[57:32] of
[57:33] work God has put you
[57:36] there to be an example of a true
[57:42] Christian that's why God has placed you
[57:44] in that
[57:46] position and if God's time is
[57:50] up he will take you away from
[57:53] there but as long as God has placed you
[57:58] there he wants you to trade his
[58:03] talent the life he has given you he
[58:07] wants you to show it to the
[58:10] people to demonstrate it to the
[58:13] people that there are still people who
[58:16] fear
[58:17] God there are still people who are
[58:21] faithful there are still people who are
[58:24] sincere there are still people who
[58:26] follow the word of
[58:28] God and then when you are there you need
[58:32] to testify of the name of the
[58:35] Lord when the woman at the
[58:38] well she got the revelation of Jesus
[58:42] Christ she didn't hold the Revelation to
[58:46] herself but she went and declared the
[58:50] gift of
[58:52] God to the other people telling them
[58:56] come and see come and see this man who
[59:00] has told me all about my
[59:03] life the name of our Lord even at our
[59:06] places of
[59:08] work let us interest the
[59:11] people you know to know what we
[59:14] believe to testify to
[59:17] them the gospel that we have to testify
[59:21] to them the message that we have
[59:24] believed
[59:26] tell them this is what I
[59:29] believe and this is what God has blessed
[59:32] me
[59:33] with this is what has kept me upright up
[59:36] to
[59:38] now and invite them come Fellowship
[59:44] together praise the name of the Lord you
[59:46] are trading your
[59:49] gift you are not buing it you're not
[59:53] hiding
[59:54] yourself but know when they see your
[59:57] life and then they tear what you are
[1:00:03] speaking they said these things much
[1:00:09] together then he says in verse
[1:00:12] 15 and to one he gave five talents to
[1:00:16] another two and to another one to every
[1:00:19] man according to his several ability and
[1:00:23] straightway took his journey now
[1:00:36] praise the name of the Lord so our
[1:00:38] measures may be are
[1:00:41] different but based on the ability that
[1:00:44] God has given to
[1:00:47] us he wants us to train this
[1:00:53] Talent he wants us to train
[1:00:56] these
[1:00:58] gifts to bring more children to the
[1:01:01] kingdom of
[1:01:03] God that you yield yourself to
[1:01:08] God that God may use
[1:01:11] you that the spirit of God
[1:01:15] himself who gives the gifts we
[1:01:19] have come and operate his own
[1:01:24] gift that has blessed us
[1:01:27] with praise the name of the Lord the
[1:01:30] eternal life he has given
[1:01:33] you he wants others also to get that
[1:01:35] same eternal
[1:01:38] life prise the name of Lord look at
[1:01:42] Cornelius when Corel the vision of the
[1:01:47] Angel he didn't just keep quiet about
[1:01:51] it but he told even his friends
[1:01:55] told his
[1:01:57] neighbors he told his
[1:01:59] relatives and then told them come we are
[1:02:03] going to have a meeting at
[1:02:05] home what the Lord has has prepared for
[1:02:09] us and that should always be our desire
[1:02:14] also the places that we're living
[1:02:17] in interest your
[1:02:21] neighbors tell your neighbors about what
[1:02:23] you believe
[1:02:26] tell your families about what you
[1:02:29] believe where you are studying
[1:02:32] from let others know what you
[1:02:36] believe let know God has given us a
[1:02:41] message praise the name of the Lord then
[1:02:44] you are trading your
[1:02:46] talent you are making many people to
[1:02:52] know what God is doing in your life
[1:02:57] praise the name of our
[1:02:59] Lord now in the message The Works that I
[1:03:03] do bear The Works that I do bear witness
[1:03:06] of
[1:03:10] me he says now we pass over those
[1:03:16] things these great words that we
[1:03:21] learn and things that we
[1:03:24] do and gifts
[1:03:26] and
[1:03:28] everything that is fine but you would
[1:03:31] better get the giver before you start
[1:03:35] after the
[1:03:39] gift God can't trust his gift with
[1:03:45] everybody do you believe that when God
[1:03:49] gives you a
[1:03:51] gift you have to watch what you are
[1:03:54] doing with it
[1:03:58] do you believe that praise the name of
[1:04:02] so when God blesses us with
[1:04:05] gifts he says we have to watch what we
[1:04:08] use the
[1:04:11] gift then he says did you know a man
[1:04:14] could take a gift of
[1:04:19] God and send his soul to hell with it
[1:04:27] do you believe that praise the name of
[1:04:29] the Lord so as God has blessed
[1:04:33] us we need to use the gifts of
[1:04:37] God to build the kingdom of
[1:04:41] God praise the name of our Lord we allow
[1:04:44] the Holy
[1:04:46] Spirit to to use
[1:04:49] Us Praise the name of our Lord to bring
[1:04:52] to manifestation
[1:04:55] the ability that God has blessed us
[1:04:59] with praise the name of the Lord then
[1:05:02] the message the Angel and the
[1:05:05] commission he says now
[1:05:08] watch the gift is what God has sent
[1:05:14] down now if he sent it in the form of a
[1:05:17] brass serpent
[1:05:27] water whatever it
[1:05:30] is you
[1:05:32] believe not the
[1:05:34] water not the
[1:05:37] serpent but the gift of
[1:05:41] God is that right the BR
[1:05:46] serent did not pray for
[1:05:49] nobody neither could the pool of water
[1:05:52] pray for anybody
[1:05:55] but God said Jesus ascended on
[1:06:00] high he gave gifts back to
[1:06:05] man and now of
[1:06:08] course God operates by the Holy
[1:06:14] Spirit through
[1:06:16] man man is God's
[1:06:21] agent praise the name of the Lord now
[1:06:24] you see how God has blessed us with
[1:06:26] several
[1:06:29] gifts when the snakes were killing the
[1:06:31] people in the
[1:06:34] wilderness brother says he gave them the
[1:06:37] BR serent as a
[1:06:43] gift thato looks at theen
[1:06:52] serpent he
[1:06:54] was praise the name of our Lord so you
[1:06:57] see that God has put several gifts in
[1:06:59] our
[1:07:03] midst to edify us to deliver us so in
[1:07:09] whatever station you may get
[1:07:15] yourself there always a gift of God has
[1:07:18] put
[1:07:19] there to deliver you out of that
[1:07:23] St praise the name of our Lord
[1:07:26] there's a gift that God has put
[1:07:29] there in the in the years after the
[1:07:32] breast
[1:07:36] serent you know he they were were there
[1:07:39] was a pool of
[1:07:41] water and then the Bible says that an
[1:07:45] angel would come and travel the
[1:07:49] water and soever was dropping in that
[1:07:52] water
[1:07:56] he would be
[1:07:58] healed praise the name of the Lord now
[1:08:00] you imagine how they were living in the
[1:08:02] Old
[1:08:06] Testament only one person to be healed
[1:08:08] in the when
[1:08:14] Falls during the times of
[1:08:18] el the Bible says only one
[1:08:23] leper was healed
[1:08:26] but right
[1:08:27] now the Bible says Christ has
[1:08:33] ascended and when he
[1:08:36] ascended he has given gifts to
[1:08:41] men praise the name of our Lord so right
[1:08:44] now we have no
[1:08:47] limit praise the name of our Lord all
[1:08:50] that we have need
[1:08:53] of is actually in Christ
[1:08:56] so it's now your faith in
[1:09:00] Christ that will bring the gift of
[1:09:05] God to
[1:09:07] manifestation praise the name of our
[1:09:09] Lord this is how God is so
[1:09:13] gracious until now praise the name of
[1:09:17] our Lord in the Old
[1:09:19] Testament he would tell the lepers you
[1:09:22] go and offer a sacrifice to the priests
[1:09:28] to be
[1:09:30] healed but right now the Bible says we
[1:09:34] are Kings and
[1:09:37] Priests praise the name of the Lord you
[1:09:40] can pray for somebody who is
[1:09:44] sick praise the name of our Lord and you
[1:09:47] can bless
[1:09:48] them praise the name of our Lord the
[1:09:52] Bible says if you believe
[1:09:56] in The Book of Mark chapter
[1:09:59] 16 let us go and read that
[1:10:03] scripture Mark
[1:10:06] 16 and then verse
[1:10:10] 1 he
[1:10:12] says and this signs shall follow them
[1:10:15] that
[1:10:22] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:10:27] Devils they shall speak with new
[1:10:30] tongues they shall take up
[1:10:34] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[1:10:39] thing it shall not hurt
[1:10:43] them they shall lay hand on the
[1:10:48] sick shall
[1:10:51] recover
[1:10:52] who the Believers
[1:10:56] praise the name of the Lord so we are
[1:10:58] all endued with
[1:11:02] gifts praise the name of the Lord like
[1:11:05] maybe at
[1:11:06] home you know the devil likes attacking
[1:11:09] children when it's deep in the
[1:11:14] Night 2
[1:11:16] a 2
[1:11:20] a maybe the phones are off
[1:11:25] can pick you and the devil attacks
[1:11:28] anybody at your
[1:11:31] home take this
[1:11:34] scripture the name of our Lord as a
[1:11:38] remedy then you lay hand on the
[1:11:42] sick and pray for that person the Bible
[1:11:46] says they shall
[1:11:48] recover praise the name of our Lord so
[1:11:51] God has endued us with various gifts
[1:11:56] but then we need to know how to use the
[1:11:58] gifts that God has given
[1:12:02] us praise the name of our Lord in the
[1:12:05] time of
[1:12:08] need know what what to
[1:12:13] apply praise the name of our Lord know
[1:12:16] what scripture background you're
[1:12:17] standing
[1:12:20] on know where your backup is
[1:12:25] and then you can Proclaim that
[1:12:31] gift the
[1:12:34] believer a brother or
[1:12:37] sister can pray for the person and they
[1:12:40] are
[1:12:43] healed praise the name of Lord Brother
[1:12:46] gives a
[1:12:49] testimony you know he was conducting a
[1:12:52] prayer line
[1:12:55] and then there was a mother who was
[1:12:57] carrying a sick
[1:13:00] child but now there was also another
[1:13:03] mother in that
[1:13:06] meeting and then that mother was moved
[1:13:09] by
[1:13:18] compassion and then in her heart she
[1:13:21] felt she needed to go and pray for that
[1:13:23] child
[1:13:27] and then the mother who had a sick child
[1:13:29] was in the prayer
[1:13:34] line so now she went to the
[1:13:38] mother excuse me I want to pray for your
[1:13:43] child she laid hands on the child prayed
[1:13:46] for the child said that but you can

[1:20:29] in him a well of water springing up into
[1:20:33] everlasting
[1:20:53] life praise the name

[1:20:59] water you've become a well of
[1:21:02] water because you have drunk from
[1:21:05] Christ but there are people who have not
[1:21:07] yet drunk from the will of

[1:22:33] person is a person of
[1:22:37] God praise the name of our Lord they
[1:22:40] recognize
[1:22:42] God and you testify to
[1:22:45] them turn away from your evil
[1:22:47] ways turn away from your wicked
[1:22:51] ways and come to the Lord
[1:22:54] the name of our Lord Jesus told that
[1:22:57] woman I will give you living
[1:23:02] water and indeed when she drank of that
[1:23:06] water she didn't keep quiet she went to
[1:23:09] the
[1:23:11] city come and here come and here this
[1:23:16] come and
[1:23:17] here and the Bible
[1:23:19] says the whole city believed
[1:23:26] John 14 and verse
[1:23:31] 29 verse
[1:23:34] 39 and many of the Samaritans of that
[1:23:37] City believed on him for the saying of
[1:23:41] the woman which testified he told me all
[1:23:45] that I ever
[1:23:47] did John
[1:23:53] 4:39 you
[1:24:06] John chapter 14 chter 4: 39
[1:24:26] praise the name of the Lord the Bible
[1:24:28] says many Samaritans
[1:24:32] believed because of the saying of the
[1:24:38] woman which
[1:24:42] testified what testimony are you giving
[1:24:44] out to the
[1:24:46] people how are you trading your
[1:24:50] talent how are you trading your gift
[1:24:55] this woman went and
[1:24:58] testified and many people
[1:25:02] believed and the Bible says when the
[1:25:05] Samaritans
[1:25:07] believed they came to
[1:25:10] Jesus when you
[1:25:13] testify bring them to
[1:25:15] Christ let them come and drink of the
[1:25:18] living
[1:25:20] Fountain let them come and know the gift
[1:25:23] of God
[1:25:26] and they also become a gift of God to
[1:25:30] others so the Bible says in
[1:25:34] verse so when the Samaritans came unto
[1:25:37] him they besought him that he would t
[1:25:40] with them and ab there two
[1:25:52] days and said unto the woman now we
[1:25:55] believe not because of thy saying for we
[1:25:59] have had them ourselves and not that
[1:26:01] this indeed the Christ the savior of the
[1:26:05] world
[1:26:31] praise the name of Lord when they came
[1:26:33] to
[1:26:34] Christ she's the one who showed them
[1:26:38] Christ we need also to show the people
[1:26:43] Christ we need to show the people the
[1:26:45] message that we have
[1:26:48] received this is what I
[1:26:50] believe this is my
[1:26:52] testimony when believe they will have a
[1:26:56] personal
[1:26:58] revelation of who Christ
[1:27:01] is and when they get a personal
[1:27:04] revelation they also tell
[1:27:08] others praise the name of the fountain
[1:27:11] is
[1:27:13] Flowing it's not stopping at
[1:27:17] you but it keeps on flowing
[1:27:21] flowing praise the name of our Lord at
[1:27:24] the time where we are looking for the
[1:27:26] last
[1:27:30] elect praise the name of Lord how will
[1:27:33] they know if somebody doesn't tell
[1:27:36] them praise the name of our Lord how
[1:27:39] will they
[1:27:40] drink if somebody doesn't release the
[1:27:42] Living Water to
[1:27:45] them praise the name of the Lord so God
[1:27:48] has blessed
[1:27:50] us he has blessed us with many gifts
[1:27:56] and even you are a
[1:27:58] gift use the gift that God has given
[1:28:01] you to bring many Souls into the kingdom
[1:28:04] of

[1:28:22] gift of of the gift of

[1:28:34] of Jesus
[1:28:36] Christ praise the name of our Lord we
[1:28:39] need to be like that woman at the
[1:28:42] well she knew the gift of
[1:28:45] God and she used the gift of
