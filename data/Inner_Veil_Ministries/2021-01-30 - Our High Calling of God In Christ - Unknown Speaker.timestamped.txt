[0:11] solar tattoo from verse seven to verse
[0:14] fourteen
[0:14] studios and i requested my brother to
[0:18] read it
[0:28] philippe
[2:05] father in the name of jesus christ
[2:09] thank you lord for this day we thank you
[2:12] again for the service
[2:15] we pray that lord you may grant speak to
[2:17] us again tonight
[2:20] and
[2:47] once again a great in the name of our
[2:49] lord jesus christ
[2:52] i appreciate the pastor for yet another
[2:54] opportunity
[2:59] amen amen i want to preach on our high
[3:02] calling of god in
[3:03] christ
[3:09] our high calling of god in christ
[3:15] and now that word
[3:30] it's not an earthly calling see or
[3:32] without yani
[3:33] it's not a political calling so it talks
[3:36] here sir
[3:36] not not even a professional calling well
[3:39] i see we told what he saw me
[3:41] but it's an upward calling
[3:44] the jew
[4:13] too it is an upward calling that paul
[4:15] was talking about
[4:16] we told uh about paulo
[4:20] now let us maybe try to look at the
[4:22] different scenarios
[4:26] then we get
[4:40] praise and you know like maybe
[4:43] somebody is a teacher ah penguin named
[4:47] that is their calling you want your me
[4:49] to work that is something they like the
[4:51] most
[4:52] okay so a teacher will know how to make
[4:56] lesson plans
[4:59] know how to handle children
[5:03] or whatever level so he has to go
[5:06] through some form of training computer
[5:09] my friends are flying
[5:10] and you know as teachers they also have
[5:14] grades or levels
[5:18] maybe from teaching the young children
[5:19] to get on a physician
[5:21] maybe to teaching primarily i want
[5:36] um
[5:54] are very high levels like somebody maybe
[5:58] can do
[5:59] dog traits then again
[6:04] i'll find out that you are using you
[6:05] know those kind of levels
[6:08] for a teacher
[6:11] if we can strike that level of having a
[6:14] post-doctorate degree
[6:34] [Music]
[6:46] it's just the same thing maybe for
[6:49] doctors maybe
[6:52] and then he's able to to treat the most
[6:55] complicated
[6:56] case analysis
[7:00] then he will be having that kind of
[7:02] satisfaction
[7:10] you know and then maybe a businessman
[7:14] it may start with the capital of maybe
[7:15] ten thousand tanzanian shillings
[7:20] he does his merchandise
[7:23] and now it increases to one million and
[7:26] now
[7:26] millionaire there you find it has
[7:28] increased so much
[7:31] like there is a man i read the entire of
[7:34] in tanzania
[7:37] i'm forgetting his name but it was an
[7:40] elderly man i think he died when he was
[7:41] seven something he was just as i died
[7:43] last year uh
[7:44] you know they kind of told me and they
[7:46] married the young wife was maybe a
[7:48] popular person
[7:52] he was talking about how he started from
[7:55] a humble family
[8:10] putting money in to help other people
[8:17] now here paul is telling us
[8:20] praise the name of us when we go to
[8:22] philippians chapter 3.
[8:46] now for us to gain christ that's an
[8:53] in our illegici
[8:56] praise and the movement then he said
[8:59] yeah
[8:59] doubtlessly ah and i count all things
[9:03] but
[9:03] loss for the excellence of the knowledge
[9:05] of christ that's an amazing
[9:12] [Music]
[9:21] and account them but down that i may win
[9:24] christ
[9:27] crystal praise the name of our lord
[9:30] there has to be an
[9:31] exchange there are things you have
[9:59] that he counted all the things he had
[10:02] known
[10:02] okay i
[10:07] that he may gain the excellence of
[10:09] christ really our part of
[10:11] a crystal and then you know and it
[10:13] should be something that is continuous
[10:15] in our lives
[10:30] us may be bringing you just confess the
[10:34] lord jesus as your personal savior you
[10:36] know i'm curious to christopher

[10:45] because you've just come in
[10:49] and as you keep on moving up in the left
[10:52] so you start
[10:52] learning that this thing is wrong

[18:39] things that god takes you through
[18:42] a christian competition praise the name
[18:44] of our lord you know whatever

[20:20] about your sin come out and they're not
[20:22] clear
[20:23] you will not succeed to overcome the
[20:25] devil
[20:28] pray in the name of our lord you know
[20:29] whatever you see how you can overcome
[20:31] the devil can you know
[20:46] my little
[21:17] [Applause]
[21:37] in the calling of christ or christian he
[21:39] doesn't want you to sing
[21:41] attack
[21:47] [Applause]
[22:00] [Applause]
[22:09] that as you are moving in this year
[22:11] that's not pointless
[22:13] and you are falling short of the
[22:15] requirement of not sinning
[22:21] the blood of jesus christ
[22:24] that if you become inadequate come out
[22:27] here to shaykh
[22:28] if you sin come on on this journey
[22:32] then he points you to the blood so you
[22:35] still have to go
[22:36] into the blood and there you go and
[22:38] confess your sin
[22:39] now you're moving now in the land is the
[22:43] name of ours
[22:44] so our highway our high calling for your

[22:50] have need of in this year
[23:21] called us were you really acquitted he
[23:23] is faithful
[23:25] so then we look at the lord that's what
[23:28] the bible is told
[23:30] hebrews chapter 12 verse 1
[23:34] with patience
[23:37] and the patience and any patience there
[23:40] is suffering
[23:43] familiar there is pain praise the name
[23:47] of god
[23:47] because to be patient means
[23:51] there's something you are suffering
[23:55] there is something you are tolerating
[23:58] it is not pleasant
[24:02] you have somebody you
[24:32] [Applause]
[24:45] by anyone's relationship who is this
[24:46] initiator behind the orientation who is
[24:49] the one who starts your face
[24:52] he starts your faith and he's the one to
[24:55] complete your faith
[24:57] is the author and finisher yeah in the
[25:00] men's relation
[25:01] you need to start the journey with
[25:03] christ
[25:06] you need to complete it with christ
[25:12] now when

[26:21] which is
[26:30] [Applause]
[26:38] now you see at that point in this book
[26:40] of philippians
[26:42] look at the question of philippi which
[26:44] is according to the historians
[26:47] he wrote it in 1864.
[27:19] that paul didn't know him uh he managed
[27:21] to come back
[27:22] home do we paul knew christ our lord him
[27:25] from christ but
[27:25] he deserved to know more of christ
[27:30] praying the name of god the holy spirit
[27:35] [Applause]
[27:49] [Applause]
[28:01] not as though i had already attained
[28:04] security
[28:05] configure either were already perfect
[28:10] but i follow after luckily
[28:14] if that i may apprehend healing
[28:19] that for which also i'm apprehended of
[28:22] christ
[28:26] that i follow after you
[28:43] just the calling that god has called us
[28:45] listen we talk about movement twitter
[28:47] is something that is continuous
[28:52] praise the name of god is a continuous
[28:55] kind of
[28:56] holding god
[28:58] [Music]
[29:12] [Applause]
[29:52] not he that comes in see are you
[29:54] annoying here and then he goes out
[29:56] naked but the bible says can you believe
[29:58] it
[29:59] endures yes to the end how the mission
[30:03] the same shall be saved
[30:05] so even when jesus was telling his
[30:07] disciples
[30:10] you have believed in me how can you harm
[30:12] your
[30:13] ministry you continue in my wife
[30:17] if you continue come up and this
[30:31] [Applause]
[30:34] it's not coming in today if we check
[30:37] with each other you'll go out the
[30:38] following day now
[30:39] shall not talk it will not help you it
[30:41] actually idea what does the bible say of
[30:43] the devil
[30:45] what does the bible say about satan
[30:57] [Applause]
[31:16] you are of your father the devil ah
[31:20] and the last of your father you will do
[31:23] not
[31:24] know he was a murderer
[31:27] from the beginning
[31:30] and
[32:09] and then let us read that verse four
[32:12] and five and that because of false
[32:15] brother unaware is brought in
[32:21] who came in privately to spy out our
[32:24] liberty
[32:27] company
[32:54] their liberty and then he says
[32:58] they came that they can take us
[33:01] back into bondage you have to release
[33:04] your turn upon your tumor and then in
[33:05] verse five he says that's some study
[33:07] to whom we gave place by
[33:10] subjection
[33:16] not for an hour
[33:21] you see now they entered into the p
[33:25] they entered among the people but they
[33:28] were false brethren
[33:31] and now when they started saying what
[33:32] they were saying
[33:35] they heard them what do you say didn't
[33:38] obey them for one hour
[33:44] that the truth of the gospel
[33:49] might continue with you
[34:06] [Applause]
[34:23] and then we start reading from verse 30.
[34:26] and as he spoke these words many
[34:28] believed on him
[34:32] then jesus said to those jews which
[34:34] believed on him
[34:35] yes if you continue
[34:39] in my wife then you
[34:42] are my disciples
[34:46] praise
[34:58] [Music]
[35:16] as long as your faith lasts really in
[35:18] bloody immanuel command so
[35:20] if you get healed now come on upon
[35:22] yourself
[35:23] you need to believe in a possible
[35:25] meaning that you are healed
[35:28] but along the way if you believe i'm not
[35:32] healed come out i mean one person's your
[35:33] opponent you'll get back into the
[35:35] problem you have a base out i wrote the
[35:37] ten community
[35:38] that's what it is even the believer
[35:40] praise the name of god
[35:41] what does the bible say when an evil
[35:44] spirit is cast out of a person you're a
[35:46] wrong child foreign
[35:49] in the wilderness in dry places
[35:53] and then he desires to come back
[36:10] of the house is your face
[36:14] me money so if that evil spirit comes
[36:17] back and doesn't get their face
[36:22] it goes back and rude and gets
[36:37] so now when jesus was delivering the
[36:39] people oh yeah yeah yes
[36:41] he told them go and sin
[36:44] no more when they stand up
[36:48] is the good master of this man indeed
[36:51] even our salvation i talk of where to
[36:54] you shouldn't
[36:55] lose what you're saying
[36:58] a man in christ christian that he saves
[37:01] you
[37:01] i'm buying liquor pray in the name of
[37:04] god you're never gonna kill me you
[37:05] shouldn't lose faith
[37:08] [Applause]
[37:19] [Applause]
[37:21] where is it because salvation is of the
[37:24] lord
[37:26] don't look at your abilities we need to
[37:29] look what the finished work on the
[37:30] caravan is
[37:32] called finished
[37:57] [Applause]
[38:16] be hard beginning but you just call upon
[38:19] the name of the lord
[38:21] what does the bible say even the bible
[38:23] shall call upon the name
[38:26] shall be said pray is the name of our
[38:28] lord
[38:29] daniel daniel when he saw

[38:46] [Applause]
[38:55] let us read the book of daniel daniel
[38:58] praise the name of our lord you know
[39:00] barnabas here and then we read the verse
[39:02] then in chapter 10. daniel cooper and
[39:04] verse 15.
[39:05] started and when he had spoken such
[39:08] words unto me
[39:10] i set my face toward the ground and i
[39:12] became
[39:26] then i opened my mouth and spoke and
[39:28] said unto him that stood before me
[39:30] oh my lord by the vision my sorrows are
[39:34] turned
[39:34] upon me and i've have retained no
[39:37] strength
[39:58] [Applause]
[40:23] anyway praise the name of our lord
[40:26] don't be ashamed to tell god your
[40:28] condition
[40:31] open enough to god oh this is my
[40:34] weakness
[40:36] this is where
[41:04] how come you know there are people who
[41:07] make mistakes
[41:10] and then they don't care like anyhow you
[41:12] just go away
[41:14] no apparently praise the name of god
[41:17] daniel told the angel
[41:18] daniela
[41:25] [Applause]
[41:35] for how can the servant of my lord talk
[41:37] with this my lord
[41:39] as for me straight away there remained
[41:41] no strength in me
[41:42] neither is there a breath left in me
[42:19] are you concerned about your weaknesses
[42:22] are you concerned about your failures
[42:25] then you mention them to god
[42:26] deposit targeting you have confidence in
[42:29] you
[42:30] know the sickness i said lord jesus
[42:33] look what peter have mongodb pray is the
[42:35] name of god
[42:37] when they saw jesus walking on the wall
[42:39] yesterday
[42:40] on the master at first they were scared
[42:42] now one's all equipped and that's what
[42:44] the devil always does
[42:45] you're turning off you look at your help
[42:50] as something so bad
[42:53] they saw jesus walking on water
[43:10] finished
[43:13] that is causing storms
[43:17] and then jesus said it is me deeper yes
[43:20] peter saying no you wanna come anywhere
[43:24] build me come here
[43:38] no
[43:52] a pepper who was walking towards christ
[43:56] peter petrol was obeying the word of god
[44:00] to walk on water what's christ when they
[44:03] are crystal
[44:03] so his claim max we talk about you his
[44:48] peter was walking there's a petrol
[44:50] worked in bed then what the devil did
[44:52] people maybe brought a very high storm
[44:55] again
[44:56] will be kubwa a lot of water mainly
[45:00] until maybe he couldn't see jesus
[45:04] [Applause]
[45:27] but it doesn't mean that because there
[45:29] is darkness
[45:58] is
[46:03] [Music]
[46:12] water and he lost the vision of jesus
[46:17] he started drowning deeper and that's
[46:19] what the devil always does
[46:22] he wants you to turn your eyes from god
[47:04] [Applause]
[47:28] one like the appearance of a man and he
[47:31] strengthened me
[47:35] praise the name of
[48:05] what was the purpose of the storms
[48:08] that you may not continue following
[48:11] and you see the devil is scheming
[48:14] turning him down he always comes in he
[48:16] wants to put you down
[48:46] we said that a christian journey you
[48:48] know steve mcquambis
[48:50] is a marathon near safari and beyond
[48:53] therefore
[48:53] and a marathon beautiful you reach
[48:56] somewhere
[48:57] who now think i'm having a cue and the
[48:59] devil can start making you think that
[49:00] you're not going in the right direction
[49:05] praise the name of god
[49:08] then you start looking at maybe another
[49:10] rule you're taking your attention
[49:19] my little children first john chapter 2
[49:21] versus
[49:24] my little children you think i write
[49:27] unto you that you see
[49:41] and is the propagation for our sins
[49:47] and no tone not for hours only
[49:51] but also for the sins of the world
[50:10] say that
[50:16] [Applause]
[50:23] so now when the devil puts you in any
[50:25] form of stress
[50:30] crystal right now currently
[50:34] in your condition still appropriations
[50:50] you just only need to have confidence in
[50:52] the blood of
[51:15] [Applause]

[1:16:32] good to
[1:16:46] but he lost the greatest thing
[1:16:51] and the rest of them didn't mean very
[1:16:54] much to him
[1:16:57] when he turned down the leadership of
[1:17:00] eternal life
[1:17:14] mark the bible says
[1:17:18] i knelt it down good master
[1:17:22] what shall i do he was young
[1:17:26] he was rich and he was a lullaby
[1:17:30] and all these things achieving wealth
[1:17:32] and leadership is not something of one
[1:17:35] day
[1:17:41] the prophet is
[1:17:54] [Applause]
[1:17:56] obey his parents he was able to be a
[1:17:59] good
[1:17:59] businessman

[1:19:52] but now when eternal life was presented
[1:19:59] it was hard for him to let the
[1:20:18] this young man
[1:20:21] is stumbling
[1:20:24] his achievements happening
[1:20:28] he looked at aryana how can i as a
[1:20:32] businessman
