[29:42] what
[29:43] by [singing] thy grace
[29:47] can
[29:49] foil [singing]
[29:50] the tempest [music]
[29:52] power.
[29:56] Ooh, [music and singing]
[29:57] like thyself,
[30:01] my

[31:16] me. [music]
[31:20] me [singing]
[31:22] feel thyself
[31:25] before [singing]
[31:28] my closing
[31:31] eyes.
[31:34] Shine
[31:36] through the blue
[31:40] [music]
[31:41] points [singing]
[31:42] me to the skies.
[31:47] [singing]
[31:48] [music]
[31:50] morning
[31:51] breaks
[31:53] and [music and singing]
[31:55] us
[31:57] shadows
[31:59] sleep
[32:01] [music]
[32:02] in [singing]
[32:04] life in death. Oh [singing] Lord abide
[32:11] with [music]
[32:13] me. [singing]
[32:15] He abide. [music]
[32:18] Heal [singing]
[32:22] [music]
[32:26] [singing]
[32:31] [music]
[32:32] [singing]
[32:35] [music] with [singing] me.
[32:42] [music]
[32:43] I'm rejoicing
[32:46] night [singing] and [music] day
[32:50] as I walk the narrow
[32:54] way.
[32:57] For [singing and music] the comfort
[33:01] abide [singing]
[33:04] with
[33:05] me, [music]
[33:07] he [singing] abide.
[33:13] Are you
[33:23] [singing]
[33:24] here
[33:27] [music] with
[33:29] me? [singing]
[33:32] [music]
[33:34] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[33:34] &gt;&gt; I'm rejoicing
[33:37] night and day
[33:41] as [singing] I walk the narrow [music]
[33:46] way.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, the comforter
[33:52] abise
[33:55] with [singing]
[33:56] me.
[34:01] Oh, [music and singing] I'm rejoicing
[34:05] night and day [music and singing]
[34:08] as I walk the narrow
[34:13] way.
[34:15] for [singing and music]
[34:16] the confessor
[34:20] abise
[34:22] [singing] with
[34:24] me.
[34:26] [music]
[34:29] [applause]
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning?
[34:38] &gt;&gt; The dove abides.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; The dove abides.
[34:45] Amen.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; So, uh
[34:49] just want us to get into the scripture
[34:53] reading
[34:55] if we can stand up.
[34:59] Uh
[35:01] you know when you come to
[35:06] this age
[35:10] &gt;&gt; the things you do
[35:14] are not for any purpose
[35:19] because you are doing the last things
[35:25] and you think you are doing the best.
[35:31] When you come to our age,
[35:34] you'll be able to understand that
[35:38] you can find out from brother, brother
[35:41] seai
[35:44] that when you come to a certain
[35:47] particular age,
[35:50] brother Fred knows,
[35:52] you don't dress to impress anybody
[35:57] anymore. more.
[36:01] No, you are the world begins to narrow
[36:04] down
[36:06] and you are just looking at the channel
[36:10] the way out.
[36:14] Amen.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; And so sometimes
[36:19] uh when I stand down here to preach,
[36:23] it's because I pondered over certain
[36:25] things.
[36:29] Amen. Amen.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit
[36:34] causes you to get into a certain
[36:36] scripture
[36:38] and it drives you maybe for a week, a
[36:41] month,
[36:43] it keeps coming back.
[36:46] Amen. Amen. We are on the home stretch.
[36:58] Amen. Amen.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; So if you don't mind,
[37:03] let us bow our heads to the earth.
[37:09] Hence where we came
[37:12] and God who created us
[37:15] and put us in the dust of the earth.
[37:20] I pray that he'll be present with us.
[37:24] to speak to us this morning
[37:27] and to make these words alive.
[37:31] Father, we ask for your presence
[37:34] and not only for presence,
[37:37] but father that your presence
[37:41] may produce his effects among us
[37:46] as we preach this morning.
[37:48] Bless the pastor of the church. Bless
[37:51] the support hands, Lord.
[37:54] Bless the families here gathered.
[37:58] And Lord, I pray that you may open the
[38:01] eyes
[38:03] like Elisha prayed to open the eyes of
[38:06] his servants
[38:08] that he may look to the unseen
[38:12] and be able to look into dimension of
[38:14] life.
[38:16] We need you father in Jesus name. Amen.
[38:20] Amen.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; So John 15,
[38:25] I'll start with two verses.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Verse one
[38:32] and verse two.
[38:34] Brother Masa, you are welcome.
[38:38] Amen. Amen. Brother Masa is one of the
[38:40] people who can drive you in the Kayola
[38:42] bus.
[38:46] Amen. He's a deacon in the church in
[38:49] Toro.
[38:51] But now by work is best here.
[38:55] So John 15 verse one and two
[39:00] he says I am
[39:03] the true vine
[39:07] and my father is the husband man.
[39:11] He doesn't say I am a vine
[39:15] but he says I am the true vine.
[39:20] Every branch in me,
[39:25] that's very wonderful statement,
[39:29] that beareth not fruit,
[39:32] he taketh away. The branch is in him.
[39:39] And for a season,
[39:42] it may fail to bear fruit,
[39:46] but yet it's a branch in him,
[39:52] and every branch in me
[39:56] that beareth fruit
[39:59] that beareth fruit
[40:05] He purges it
[40:09] &gt;&gt; that it may bring forth more fruit.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add blessing to the reading
[40:18] of his word.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[40:22] So he says I am.
[40:28] And this I am
[40:31] is a reference to the alpha and omega.
[40:36] The unchanging God.
[40:38] He doesn't have yesterday.
[40:41] He doesn't have a tomorrow. He's always
[40:44] I am.
[40:46] The I am was the father of Abraham.
[40:51] I am the father of Isaac.
[40:54] I am the father of Jacob.
[40:58] Not I was but I am.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; So God in Christ
[41:04] identified himself under several
[41:07] attributes.
[41:09] He says I am the bread of life
[41:14] meaning the alpha and omega
[41:17] was the bread of life.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; I am the bread which came down from
[41:24] heaven.
[41:28] I am the living bread which came down
[41:30] from heaven.
[41:34] Then he says, I am the light of the
[41:36] world.
[41:39] I am the door to the ship.
[41:42] I am the good shepherd.
[41:45] I am the resurrection.
[41:47] Not I will be but I am.
[41:52] So I am is the description
[41:57] of the allsufficient God.
[42:02] The God that David speaks about
[42:06] in Psalms 23.
[42:09] The Lord is my shepherd.
[42:12] Now the Lord is actually in there
[42:17] is all the attributes that God is.
[42:23] And because David sees him
[42:27] under that fullness
[42:30] then he says I lack nothing.
[42:34] I know I have got family deeds
[42:37] but I am is here.
[42:40] I know my body is sick
[42:43] but I am is here.
[42:46] Are you together with me? Just in the
[42:49] week, I couldn't even come out of bed.
[42:53] Amen. I was just beaten flat down
[42:58] and we had to get some kind of a a
[43:01] physician.
[43:03] I know one thing. I am was present there
[43:07] with
[43:08] amen. So I always believe
[43:12] that whatever I do,
[43:14] I might be doing it for the last time.
[43:19] Amen. So John 15
[43:22] that we are dealing with today
[43:26] is we are dealing with the I am
[43:30] that is taking the identity
[43:34] of a true vine
[43:37] a true vine. So he's not saying I am a
[43:40] vine
[43:42] but he's saying I am a true vine.
[43:46] meaning that is totally different
[43:49] from all the vines upon the earth.
[43:52] But he has chosen to use the vine
[43:57] to explain himself
[44:00] his character, his nature, his
[44:03] relationship with the church.
[44:06] So when the word true is used of Christ,
[44:11] it brings or it speaks about the
[44:14] capstone revelation of Christ.
[44:19] Amen. You see you know the cupstone
[44:23] revelation
[44:26] meaning there isn't any form of
[44:28] revelation
[44:31] below that but he is the capstone
[44:34] revelation.
[44:37] Meaning that he is the one who has
[44:41] finally come out and projected himself
[44:46] as the manifested fullness
[44:49] of the Goded body.
[44:52] And that also speaks
[44:55] about a finished work
[44:58] because when he's working,
[45:01] he's still revealing himself
[45:04] in his work.
[45:06] And by revelation of what?
[45:09] BUT WHEN WE talk about the capstone
[45:12] revelation,
[45:14] we are talking about him at the top
[45:18] revealing himself.
[45:21] He has come to a point
[45:23] where he needs no prophet
[45:27] to prophesy about him because he is that
[45:31] prophecy now
[45:33] and it is present.
[45:36] So true means that we are looking at
[45:38] Christ
[45:41] beyond the shadows that represented him.
[45:46] I will show you something here. That
[45:49] when he is presenting himself to the
[45:51] seven church ages.
[45:54] Amen. He presents particular attributes
[45:58] about himself
[46:01] to particular church age
[46:04] that was necessary
[46:07] for that church to hold on
[46:11] and be able to overcome the enemy.
[46:14] So now in the first church
[46:18] he says he that holds the seven stars in
[46:21] his right hand
[46:24] who walks in the midst of the seven
[46:27] golden candles.
[46:30] So he was in control
[46:33] of all the messengers
[46:36] of the churches
[46:38] that were going to come through.
[46:41] And the way God uses a messenger
[46:45] and the way he protects that messenger
[46:48] is a reflection of how he's going to use
[46:51] the church and he protects the church.
[46:55] for we were firmly in his right hand.
[47:01] Amen. When he comes into the next
[47:03] churches,
[47:05] he says, "I'm the first and the last
[47:09] which was dead and is alive." Now, we
[47:13] would say he was alive, but he's dead
[47:18] naturally speaking.
[47:21] But here he says, "I was dead,
[47:24] but now I'm alive." So he's presenting
[47:28] himself
[47:29] as the victory over death.
[47:34] Amen.
[47:37] Amen. Are you together with me? So he
[47:39] presents himself
[47:42] as that great victory
[47:45] when all the attributes
[47:48] that revealed Christ through the seven
[47:51] churches
[47:53] were revealed in the last church age.
[47:57] That is when Malachi 4 comes with the
[48:01] capstone revelation of Christ
[48:06] because there was no more to reveal.
[48:10] Amen. That's why at this time he says,
[48:14] "He that overcometh
[48:16] will I grant to seat
[48:19] in my throne?" Because the journey right
[48:23] now
[48:25] is almost over.
[48:29] We are walking the last stretch
[48:33] and be able to go home
[48:36] and rest from the labors.
[48:39] And he wipes our tears.
[48:43] So whatever you do, do the best way you
[48:46] know how.
[48:49] Are you together with me? If you come to
[48:52] church, mean what you are doing.
[48:56] Because we are in the capstone area.
[49:01] If we fall now, Amen. There is no
[49:05] redeeming messenger to come.
[49:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; So we must do the best we can.
[49:14] Whenever we do what we do
[49:17] now, the in the book of uh seven church
[49:20] ages,
[49:22] the Lordian church, brother Brham says,
[49:26] Jesus is giving us this description of
[49:29] himself
[49:32] in relation to the last age.
[49:35] The days of grace are winding up.
[49:40] He has looked from the first century
[49:45] right through to the 20th
[49:48] and told us all things concerning these
[49:50] ages.
[49:52] Before he reveals the characteristics of
[49:55] this last church
[50:00] to us, he gives us one final look
[50:05] at his own glorious and supreme deity.
[50:12] This is the capstone revelation
[50:16] of himself.
[50:18] So we are in the last churches.
[50:22] AND GOD is giving us
[50:26] the last of the revelations
[50:30] about himself
[50:32] in this flesh. The next we shall have of
[50:35] him
[50:38] is when we shall be like him
[50:42] after our body change
[50:45] and I trust we are all looking for those
[50:47] hours.
[50:49] Amen. So in this last church,
[50:53] Christ is now revealed
[50:56] in doctrine.
[50:58] You cannot add any scripture
[51:02] that can change what we know Christ to
[51:04] be.
[51:07] Christ is being revealed
[51:09] as the fullness of the Godhead
[51:13] this time in the body
[51:16] of the bride. Are you together with me?
[51:20] So Christ is revealed
[51:23] and having preeminence among his people.
[51:28] So we come to a point where Christ
[51:31] should be
[51:33] everything in our lives.
[51:36] Amen. Capstone revelation
[51:40] appealing to capstone response
[51:45] from the bride.
[51:48] Amen. Amen. So Christ is revealed
[51:52] and having preeminence.
[51:55] If you say, "Show me Christ."
[51:59] I want us to turn to one another
[52:03] and say, "This is the only way you can
[52:06] understand
[52:08] the fullness of the Godhead body.
[52:12] not in the Jesus body.
[52:15] But he has taken another body, the body
[52:18] of the bride.
[52:20] Amen. That's the capstone revelation.
[52:25] Amen. So, uh, also we see that the son
[52:31] of man ministry
[52:33] which was promised in St. Luke 17
[52:38] and in agreement with Revelation 10:7,
[52:43] is all fulfilled.
[52:45] There is nothing to look forward to
[52:49] but the change of our bodies
[52:54] in the coming of the Lord.
[52:56] So currently we are not looking forward
[52:59] for more prophets
[53:02] in the end time. Amen. He introduces
[53:06] himself to this age.
[53:09] Now in Revelation
[53:12] chapter 3 verse14
[53:15] and he says unto the angel of the church
[53:18] of the lordicians right
[53:24] this thing says the amen
[53:29] the true witness
[53:32] the beginning of the creation of God.
[53:36] So he's giving now
[53:39] the titles of his identification.
[53:43] He now calls himself the man.
[53:47] Meaning that there is nothing more to
[53:50] look forward for.
[53:53] Because when you say faith prayer,
[53:57] amen, you when you say amen,
[54:01] what happens
[54:03] is that your prayer is done.
[54:08] So he says, "I am the amen."
[54:12] AND THEN HE SAYS, "THE faithful
[54:16] and true witness,
[54:19] the beginning
[54:21] of the creation of God." Are you
[54:24] together with me? Because we are now the
[54:28] forming for
[54:30] of a new creation.
[54:33] The fallen creation
[54:36] IS GOING TO PHASE OUT.
[54:38] But there is a new creation.
[54:42] And part of that creation
[54:45] is me and you. But he calls himself the
[54:50] beginning of that creation.
[54:53] So as a true witness,
[54:56] he stands OUT
[54:59] ABOVE ALL THE SHADOWS.
[55:03] That's what makes him a true witness.
[55:07] Are you together with me? Yeah. A
[55:10] faithful witness.
[55:12] The way you know like in a a case or
[55:15] court
[55:18] he must say I saw I have I this or the
[55:22] evidence.
[55:26] at himself. NOW HE BECOMES THE faithful
[55:31] witness,
[55:33] the manifestation
[55:36] of every shadow that came over to us.
[55:41] And I told you that whenever there is a
[55:45] shadow
[55:48] is because there is an object standing
[55:50] somewhere
[55:53] and the light is hitting ON THAT OBJECT.
[55:57] AND THEREFORE A SHADOW COMING over here.
[56:01] And then he has been coming.
[56:04] And at the time now he's going to face
[56:08] out the shadows
[56:12] because he has finally come.
[56:17] SO HE SAYS I'M NOW a true witness.
[56:22] Amen.
[56:23] The prophet says in the Philadelphiaian
[56:26] churches,
[56:28] &gt;&gt; he says these things
[56:31] says he
[56:34] is true.
[56:37] Now this word true
[56:41] is a very wonderful word.
[56:44] It does not mean true
[56:48] in just the sense
[56:51] that it is opposite of false.
[56:55] Are you together with me? Like ideas
[57:00] and then you say that's wrong, this is
[57:01] right.
[57:03] like a production of objects,
[57:07] you know, in a factory
[57:09] &gt;&gt; and you say this one is genuine, this
[57:11] one is not.
[57:14] You know, is the prophet says that's not
[57:17] what he means when he says true.
[57:23] It is it expresses perfect realization
[57:27] of an idea
[57:32] as contrasted with partial realization.
[57:38] Are you together with me like the lamb
[57:42] was a partial realization
[57:46] of the Messiah the redeemer.
[57:50] So when he comes forth
[57:53] is not that lamb anymore.
[57:57] It is I that is true.
[58:01] And John introduces him as the lamb of
[58:05] God who takes away the sins of the
[58:08] world.
[58:10] Amen. Praise the Lord. So Moses the
[58:15] prophet says gave you that bread from
[58:18] heaven.
[58:20] But my father
[58:22] giveth you the bread from heaven.
[58:27] Are you together with me?
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So John 5 and 15 verse one he
[58:35] says I am the true v.
[58:40] Now in Hebrews 9:24
[58:44] if we can go there a little bit.
[58:47] Christ Christ
[58:51] is not entered into the holy places made
[58:55] with hands,
[59:00] which are the figures of the truth,
[59:05] but into heaven itself,
[59:09] now to appear
[59:11] in the presence of God for us.
[59:16] Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; He did not enter into the holy places
[59:23] made with hands
[59:25] because in the Old Testament
[59:28] on the day of atonement,
[59:31] the priest comes from among the people
[59:36] to enter places
[59:38] that are made by man.
[59:41] He enters into the first court,
[59:44] goes into the second court, goes into
[59:47] the third court, presents the blood,
[59:52] and after he presents the blood, he
[59:54] walks out.
[59:56] But now, [screaming]
[59:58] when Jesus comes to do the redemption,
[1:00:03] what happens here is not going into
[1:00:06] places
[1:00:08] which are made by heart.
[1:00:11] when he was sacrificed,
[1:00:14] crucified
[1:00:15] on Calvary, and he died, rose on the
[1:00:19] third day, AND HE COME ALIVE.
[1:00:23] Praise God. I want you to know this.
[1:00:27] We, you know, he met Mary Magdalene,
[1:00:32] a man in the garden. And Mary wanted to
[1:00:35] touch her.
[1:00:37] And he says, "Woman,
[1:00:40] don't touch me. I'm not ascended to the
[1:00:43] father."
[1:00:44] He was not ascending
[1:00:47] to places made with many.
[1:00:52] He was going to ascend
[1:00:56] into the heavens.
[1:00:58] HALLELUJAH. AND BETWEEN THAT day
[1:01:03] and the coming I mean and the appearing
[1:01:07] in the meeting where Tom was.
[1:01:11] Amen. Who wanted to touch him and he
[1:01:15] allowed him he had already ascended.
[1:01:19] Hallelujah. And when he ascended
[1:01:23] it means IF HE WAS ACCEPTED
[1:01:26] he was accepted for you.
[1:01:31] BUT IF YOU ALSO FACE OUT TODAY,
[1:01:37] you have got the access.
[1:01:40] He's the firstborn
[1:01:42] among many brethren.
[1:01:45] He's the beginning
[1:01:47] of THAT NEW CREATION
[1:01:50] THAT WHEN THEY GET OUT OF THE BODY, THEY
[1:01:53] JUST ASCEND direct to the father.
[1:01:57] Oh, that way he is the true lamb.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; And John 1:28,
[1:02:07] first John 2:8,
[1:02:10] he says, "Because the darkness is
[1:02:12] passed,
[1:02:15] the darkness is passed
[1:02:18] and the true light now shineth."
[1:02:22] Since the word indeed expresses perfect
[1:02:26] realization
[1:02:31] as against the idea of partial
[1:02:34] REALIZATION
[1:02:38] as illustrated in these verses.
[1:02:42] We can now understand
[1:02:45] as never before
[1:02:48] antype
[1:02:51] contrasted with type
[1:02:55] the substance
[1:02:57] with the shadow.
[1:03:02] Take the example of now mana from
[1:03:04] heaven.
[1:03:07] God sent down angel bread.
[1:03:12] from heaven for Israel.
[1:03:15] But that bread did not satisfy.
[1:03:20] It was only good for a day.
[1:03:23] Those who ate it were hungry again the
[1:03:25] next day.
[1:03:28] It was left around.
[1:03:30] It was contaminated.
[1:03:33] But Jesus is the true bread from heaven.
[1:03:38] Amen. where of mana was just a type.
[1:03:43] And if any man eats of that bread
[1:03:47] that came from heaven, he will never
[1:03:50] hunger again.
[1:03:53] He does not need to come back and eat
[1:03:55] again.
[1:03:58] The moment he parttook
[1:04:02] of the eternal life.
[1:04:07] Amen. So he indeed was reality
[1:04:14] not needed any longer
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; for the shadow.
[1:04:19] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; NO NEED OF a shadow now
[1:04:24] because the light has come
[1:04:28] and that light
[1:04:30] is now shining out.
[1:04:34] Amen. to identify
[1:04:37] the Lord Jesus before us. And I want you
[1:04:42] to know that when you come to church,
[1:04:46] you don't come to prostrate before an
[1:04:48] idea.
[1:04:52] You don't come to prostrate
[1:04:55] before a good doctrine.
[1:04:59] You don't come to prostrate. Amen.
[1:05:04] before a good teacher.
[1:05:07] When you come down here, you are coming
[1:05:10] in the presence of he that is true.
[1:05:17] That's how far we have come
[1:05:20] into the capstone revelation of Christ
[1:05:25] which is not an idea but a reality.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see, we come to a
[1:05:37] point
[1:05:38] where there must come something
[1:05:42] that makes what we do become real.
[1:05:48] Whereby if I have come to church,
[1:05:52] I have not come to please my brother.
[1:05:57] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:06:01] Hallelujah. That's why today
[1:06:04] we are looking at these two vines I mean
[1:06:08] branches.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Which are in uh uh which are in John
[1:06:16] 15:2
[1:06:19] and he says I am the true vine.
[1:06:26] So we are NOT TALKING ABOUT VINES AS IN
[1:06:29] A FORM.
[1:06:33] BUT WE are talking about the Lord Jesus
[1:06:36] Christ
[1:06:38] showing himself this morning before us
[1:06:43] as a true vine
[1:06:46] upon which every branch is you know in
[1:06:52] amen is not grafted in
[1:06:56] but it is growing
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; from him.
[1:07:02] It lives not by its life,
[1:07:07] but it lives, by his life.
[1:07:11] Hallelujah.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's why the title this morning
[1:07:17] is he cares for the two branches.
[1:07:22] He cares for the two branches.
[1:07:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:28] So uh I I want you to know here
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; that uh you know
[1:07:37] in this case
[1:07:39] we look at the vine
[1:07:42] as a creeper plant
[1:07:53] for example
[1:07:57] You know that's a creeper.
[1:08:02] That's a vine. That's what a vine is.
[1:08:06] So while we look at that,
[1:08:09] it is hiding the details
[1:08:14] in there
[1:08:16] to teach our relationship
[1:08:19] with Christ the true vine.
[1:08:23] Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So a vine is a creeper.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Although brother Brham
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; takes the same vine principle
[1:08:40] and uses it
[1:08:42] in preaching sometimes on the bride
[1:08:44] tree.
[1:08:50] Praise the Lord. So I'll give you this
[1:08:53] quote here
[1:08:55] in letting off the pressure.
[1:08:59] If you love him, say amen.
[1:09:06] He says, "I preached the other day
[1:09:10] on the bright tree
[1:09:14] on EASTER MORNING.
[1:09:16] NOW THAT Christ was the tree
[1:09:20] that was perfect,
[1:09:23] David saw it and said, "Is standing by
[1:09:29] the rivers of water
[1:09:33] and how Rome cut that tree down
[1:09:42] and perfect tree
[1:09:45] bearing perfect fruits of God
[1:09:49] and hung it on a manmade tree.
[1:09:55] Amen. Amen. But God
[1:09:58] raised it up on the third day.
[1:10:03] And then there come a bride, a bride
[1:10:07] tree,
[1:10:09] coming forth, bringing forth his fruit.
[1:10:14] and come the enemy again
[1:10:17] and cut it down through the dark ages.
[1:10:22] I we restore says the Lord
[1:10:26] how that Lutheran raised and dominated
[1:10:31] and the vine was pruned.
[1:10:35] Are you together with me? He's now
[1:10:37] talking about a bright tree.
[1:10:41] But then he uses the pris again.
[1:10:45] And so he brings in the word, the vine
[1:10:48] was pruned.
[1:10:53] Up come the Methodist
[1:10:56] denominated.
[1:10:58] The vine was pruned.
[1:11:01] Up come the Pentecostal denominations
[1:11:05] was pruned.
[1:11:07] But the fruit
[1:11:09] ripens in the top of the tree
[1:11:13] when THE EVENING LIGHTS COME OUT,
[1:11:17] we are near the ro.
[1:11:21] So we are expecting great things in the
[1:11:24] future.
[1:11:26] Hallelujah. So now right at the top of
[1:11:29] the tree,
[1:11:31] we are not at the bottom.
[1:11:34] We are not in the MIDDLE BUT WE ARE AT
[1:11:37] the top.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And as the light shines,
[1:11:45] the fruit begins to ripen.
[1:11:49] So I want you to bear in mind
[1:11:52] that John 15
[1:11:56] is not dealing with a tree
[1:11:59] is dealing with the vine
[1:12:03] WHICH HAS THREE TYPES of branches.
[1:12:10] Are you together with me? Amen. Amen. So
[1:12:13] John 15
[1:12:16] verse two
[1:12:18] he says
[1:12:20] every branch in me
[1:12:25] that beareth not fruit
[1:12:28] he takes away.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; There is a temptation to think
[1:12:36] that he cuts it off.
[1:12:39] But this branch
[1:12:42] is IN HIM
[1:12:45] BY CUTTING IT is cutting his own life.
[1:12:52] You get get to understand that very
[1:12:55] well.
[1:12:56] AND EVERY BRANCH THAT BEARETH FRUIT,
[1:13:02] he purges it that it may
[1:13:06] bring forth more fruit.
[1:13:09] So here we have got the branch that it
[1:13:13] taketh away,
[1:13:16] but it is in him.
[1:13:19] And we have a branch here
[1:13:22] which beareth fruit
[1:13:25] and it is in him. He purges it.
[1:13:29] And when then we have another category
[1:13:32] of branch.
[1:13:35] This one here is spoken about in John 15
[1:13:41] verse six.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Listen to the words she begins with.
[1:13:50] If a man abide not in me,
[1:13:56] he's using the word a man.
[1:14:02] And remember when we spoke about man and
[1:14:05] a man,
[1:14:11] are you together with me? In the
[1:14:13] beginning, it was man.
[1:14:16] God created man.
[1:14:20] He carried the image of God.
[1:14:23] But after the fall,
[1:14:26] then there was a man
[1:14:28] that was the car man.
[1:14:33] And in the Bible, when they say a man,
[1:14:37] a certain man
[1:14:39] means that that man
[1:14:42] is not under the will OF GOD.
[1:14:46] SO HE SAYS, "IF A MAN ABIDE NOT in me,
[1:14:54] HE'S CAST OFF AS A branch
[1:14:59] and is withered
[1:15:02] and men gather them
[1:15:04] and cast them in the fire
[1:15:07] and they aband
[1:15:15] There IS NO GRACE. HE CUTS IT. HE THROWS
[1:15:20] IT IN THE FIRE. BUT THE BRANCHES OF
[1:15:23] VERSE TWO,
[1:15:26] they carry his life.
[1:15:31] YOU CAN BE IN CHRIST
[1:15:34] AND FOR a moment fail to bear fruit.
[1:15:39] [sighs]
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; So we are going to bring it together.
[1:15:45] and see where the scripture takes us.
[1:15:49] So I've said this other category of
[1:15:51] branch
[1:15:53] he refers to it as a man.
[1:15:57] So to this branch
[1:16:00] he cast forth as a branch.
[1:16:05] SO THE WORD TO CAST here
[1:16:09] means to throw
[1:16:12] or let go of anything
[1:16:15] without caring where it falls.
[1:16:20] You understand what I mean? Cast it
[1:16:23] away.
[1:16:27] You don't care WHERE IT FALLS.
[1:16:30] IT DOESN'T have the father's love.
[1:16:37] Are you together with me? So the
[1:16:39] language in verse six
[1:16:43] disowns the third branch.
[1:16:47] Uh disowns.
[1:16:53] But in verse two, he owns the two
[1:16:56] branches.
[1:17:01] every branch in me
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; which is in him by birth.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; A BRANCH THAT DID NOT JOIN CHURCH.
[1:17:17] IT'S NOT A GRAFTED BRANCH,
[1:17:21] but it's an original branch.
[1:17:25] IT HAS GOT HIS DNA.
[1:17:29] IT COMES FROM THE FATHER.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; IT COMES FROM THE SAME SOURCE WITH HIM.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; You see this is where it's very
[1:17:40] important
[1:17:43] that father I must be born again.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. The new birth is very important
[1:17:55] because it makes you part of him.
[1:18:01] You share in his DNA
[1:18:04] and the only way you can be born
[1:18:08] is because in the father
[1:18:14] are you together with me? But this other
[1:18:17] one here,
[1:18:19] if a man
[1:18:21] if a man abide not in me,
[1:18:26] if he does not have my seed,
[1:18:30] if he's only in church
[1:18:33] as a sucker of blessings,
[1:18:41] he said that one
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; I CAN CAST AWAY NOT CARING. where it
[1:18:46] falls.
[1:18:49] But this John 15
[1:18:52] IS GOD taking care of his children.
[1:19:00] If I am If I am
[1:19:05] is the alpha and omega,
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; the unchanging God,
[1:19:10] he has got enough power
[1:19:13] to protect his children.
[1:19:18] Amen.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; And to cause them
[1:19:21] to bear fruit.
[1:19:24] Amen.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE FRUIT
[1:19:28] COMES FROM A LIFE that doesn't belong to
[1:19:31] the branch,
[1:19:35] but it comes from the vine. [screaming]
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; You see, that's why I say when you come
[1:19:43] to church,
[1:19:46] mean what you're doing.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Don't be a man.
[1:19:52] Be that branch.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; God
[1:19:58] in Christ
[1:20:01] identifies himself
[1:20:04] under several attributes.
[1:20:08] He said, "I am the bread of life
[1:20:11] and all those others."
[1:20:13] Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; So I am
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; is the description
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; of all the allsufficient God.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; So now when the word true is used
[1:20:31] I told you of Christ
[1:20:34] it means
[1:20:36] that he's real.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; He's true. He's not an idea.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; He's that living and present God.
[1:20:53] Praise God.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Yeah. I'm
[1:20:58] trying to get myself out here in order.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:05] [snorts and clears throat]
[1:21:07] Now
[1:21:09] God Christ
[1:21:11] cannot get his own life
[1:21:15] and throw it in fire.
[1:21:18] This one of verse six
[1:21:21] is a grafted branch.
[1:21:28] Amen. That's true.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; You know the science of today,
[1:21:34] they can get an avocado tree
[1:21:39] and they go and cut a lemon branch
[1:21:44] and bring it here on the avocado tree.
[1:21:49] And this lemon branch
[1:21:52] will feed on the life of an AVOCADO
[1:21:55] TREE.
[1:21:58] AND still produce lemons.
[1:22:06] So when I say like that
[1:22:10] then it helps us
[1:22:12] to identify ourselves.
[1:22:15] Am I a lemon tree branch? I mean am I a
[1:22:19] lemon branch?
[1:22:26] That's where the question is.
[1:22:29] Am [screaming] I a lemon branch?
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me to identify myself.
[1:22:37] IF I'M NOT A LEMON branch
[1:22:40] and I'm failing to bear fruit,
[1:22:44] I must be the branch.
[1:22:47] If any man
[1:22:51] abide in me and fails to bring fruit
[1:22:56] from that point down you begin to cry,
[1:23:01] Lord, help me to bring forth fruit.
[1:23:06] I cannot bear fruit on my own.
[1:23:11] I don't want by accident. I don't even
[1:23:14] want to imagine.
[1:23:17] that I am the grafted branch.
[1:23:21] Otherwise, any time you cast me away,
[1:23:25] not even caring where I fall.
[1:23:29] Amen.
[1:23:32] Somebody say amen.
[1:23:37] He says here
[1:23:39] in uh we would see Jesus
[1:23:43] he says now the vine
[1:23:46] doesn't bear fruit
[1:23:49] it's the branch
[1:23:53] just turn around to your brother
[1:23:56] and tell him I am supposed to bear
[1:23:58] fruit.
[1:24:02] That's a good confession. Do it again.
[1:24:07] Do it until the devil hears it.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; I am supposed to breathe,
[1:24:20] not man.
[1:24:24] But if I'm an original branch,
[1:24:27] I'm supposed to bring forth.
[1:24:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Now, if that first branch
[1:24:38] that come out of the vine
[1:24:41] produced a book of Acts behind it,
[1:24:46] that first church,
[1:24:49] if that VINE
[1:24:52] ever puts forth another branch,
[1:24:57] it will write another book of Acts
[1:24:59] behind.
[1:25:02] For the life of that vine
[1:25:08] brings forth into the branch.
[1:25:12] Sure, we got a lot of grafted branches
[1:25:16] in here.
[1:25:20] That's what the prophet says.
[1:25:25] Amen.
[1:25:28] A grafted branch
[1:25:31] will certainly bring forth I mean forth
[1:25:35] the life of the parent seat.
[1:25:41] It cannot therefore write another page
[1:25:47] of another book of acts.
[1:25:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now you are not
[1:25:53] going to write THIS BOOK ALONE.
[1:25:56] MAYBE YOU ARE GOING to contribute a
[1:25:58] verse.
[1:26:01] Hallelujah. BUT YOU ARE CERTAINLY GOING
[1:26:04] TO PRODUCE something
[1:26:08] because you are an attribute
[1:26:11] of the life that is in the fire.
[1:26:18] Are you together with me? But John, I
[1:26:21] mean 15:6,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE
[1:26:26] GRAFTED branches
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; of Hebrews 6.
[1:26:37] Are you together with me? AND THESE
[1:26:39] BRANCHES
[1:26:41] CAN be around CHURCH
[1:26:44] FOR A LONG TIME BUT still fail
[1:26:49] to bring forth fruit. They are cast
[1:26:51] away.
[1:26:54] I don't want to be that fruit.
[1:26:59] When they are cast away,
[1:27:02] you know,
[1:27:04] start looking at the midweek services.
[1:27:10] Start looking at the evening service
[1:27:14] on Sunday.
[1:27:17] Then you know cast away.
[1:27:21] I don't even care where they fall.
[1:27:25] Start looking at the communion service.
[1:27:35] He cares
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; for the two branches.
[1:27:42] Listen
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; in Hebrews chapter 6. If we turn there,
[1:27:54] [cough]
[1:27:55] excuse me.
[1:27:58] He says,
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; "For it is impossible
[1:28:04] for those who were once enlightened
[1:28:07] in verse four
[1:28:12] and have tested of the heavenly gift
[1:28:17] and were made partakers of the Holy
[1:28:19] Ghost.
[1:28:29] those who tested what the Holy Spirit
[1:28:31] does. Amen. And tested the good word of
[1:28:35] God
[1:28:39] and the powers of the world to come.
[1:28:45] All the time they are testing and
[1:28:47] testing and testing.
[1:28:51] No wonder these days they say
[1:28:55] try Jesus.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; They test.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; But the other vine,
[1:29:07] it does not have another alternative
[1:29:12] but Christ.
[1:29:15] Amen. Because it come from Christ.
[1:29:21] Where shall we go?
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have the words of eternal
[1:29:25] life.
[1:29:27] Isn't that amen?
[1:29:29] He has the words of eternal life.
[1:29:32] We don't have anywhere else to go
[1:29:37] but to him.
[1:29:40] Amen. Verse six.
[1:29:43] If they fall away
[1:29:48] to renew them again unto repentance,
[1:29:55] Seeing they crucified themselves to the
[1:29:58] son of God aresh
[1:30:00] and put him to an open shell.
[1:30:08] Now they are falling away
[1:30:12] NOT CARING WHERE THEY FALL.
[1:30:16] Either they fall into this organization
[1:30:19] or they fall into that denomination
[1:30:22] or they fall into this habit or they
[1:30:25] fall into that habit. He says, "Well,
[1:30:28] that's a branch cut off."
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? So these
[1:30:39] are the cast away branches
[1:30:43] and to these
[1:30:45] Christ does not care where they fall.
[1:30:52] You start looking
[1:30:54] amen at the interest
[1:30:59] you know he has to hide under a status.
[1:31:06] I know.
[1:31:10] Uhhuh. Status on the phone.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:31:29] and he puts a song
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; and it is a rock and roll.
[1:31:36] Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:31:42] That means
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; he's hanging out somewhere
[1:31:49] trying to fall
[1:31:51] and he doesn't care where he fall.
[1:31:55] They hide behind status.
[1:31:59] Happy birthday
[1:32:03] my friend. and the picture of the dress.
[1:32:09] I'm sure she has some better dresses.
[1:32:15] Are you together with me? You see, you
[1:32:18] know, hanging on a thread,
[1:32:23] waiting to be upset.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We just want to get these things
[1:32:41] right.
[1:32:43] Brother Brham called them borderline
[1:32:46] believers.
[1:32:51] They are in church
[1:32:54] but not in the church.
[1:33:00] the invisible church of Christ.
[1:33:05] Amen. They stay around the message for
[1:33:07] long periods,
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; but they don't fully surrender their
[1:33:13] soul.
[1:33:16] Amen. They don't own what they believe.
[1:33:22] Why do you GO TO THAT CHURCH? Then they
[1:33:25] give an explanation.
[1:33:27] But if you aren't what you believe,
[1:33:31] then you stand to give witness
[1:33:36] what you believe.
[1:33:38] Amen. They are in church because
[1:33:44] you know the reason why I'm in that
[1:33:45] church,
[1:33:47] I'm in this town because I stay with my
[1:33:49] brother who goes to that church.
[1:33:53] You know they are that other third
[1:33:57] branch.
[1:34:01] The best they could produce
[1:34:06] is the picture.
[1:34:09] The image of a rich younger ruler.
[1:34:17] You
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; must be born again.
[1:34:23] Brother Brham in questions and answers
[1:34:25] of 59.
[1:34:29] He says is now explaining this grip.
[1:34:34] The third branch
[1:34:37] you know it stands between out and in.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uticus
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; in the midnight service.
[1:34:53] He was not in
[1:34:56] he was not out.
[1:34:59] He sat in the window,
[1:35:03] the legs in
[1:35:06] the body out.
[1:35:08] And when he fell,
[1:35:11] he doesn't fall in.
[1:35:20] You have to be in completely.
[1:35:26] Amen.
[1:35:27] Years ago, we used to have young men.
[1:35:31] They used to sit at the front here
[1:35:34] and they were the amen of the church.
[1:35:39] And then the next thing they started
[1:35:42] sitting in the back
[1:35:44] and that was a sign the branch was being
[1:35:47] cut off.
[1:35:53] You see the prophet says let me just
[1:35:57] give it a parable
[1:36:00] so that you'll see and won't miss it
[1:36:04] now.
[1:36:07] Now he is writing to these Jews.
[1:36:13] Some of them are borderline believers.
[1:36:22] So he's writing to those people.
[1:36:26] Now they are in the border
[1:36:30] trying to hold the law
[1:36:35] and enter it with it into the New
[1:36:39] Testament
[1:36:43] under the blood sacrifice
[1:36:46] of Christ.
[1:36:48] And they are going in there
[1:36:50] with the ministrations of death
[1:36:54] because the law is a ministration of
[1:36:58] death.
[1:36:59] Is a revealer of where you fail
[1:37:04] but is not having enough power
[1:37:08] to help you live the life.
[1:37:12] [sighs] Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; So these are coming
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; exactly through from you know repentance
[1:37:20] from dead works
[1:37:24] and faith towards God.
[1:37:26] THEY HAD COME by the doctrine of baptism
[1:37:30] and laying on of hands,
[1:37:33] the resurrection of the dead and of
[1:37:36] eternal judgment.
[1:37:39] They had come through that phase
[1:37:43] but they were not willing.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; TO GO beyond that
[1:37:52] into union with Christ.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; They were not WILLING
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; TO GO into perfection.
[1:38:06] AND SOMETIMES YOU COME THROUGH the water
[1:38:09] baptism and you come through all these
[1:38:11] other things.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; But then you are failing
[1:38:18] to go beyond THAT
[1:38:21] personal connection to Christ
[1:38:26] where you are going to say I'm a branch
[1:38:29] in him.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:33] BY THE BASEL OF THE HOLY GHOST
[1:38:37] AND FAITH in every teaching
[1:38:40] and practicing every teaching.
[1:38:44] Are you together with me?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, see, he said now
[1:38:53] we are going to leave these WORKS
[1:38:58] and go on to TALK ABOUT PERFECTION.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU together with me?
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, you know they are talking
[1:39:09] about thunders now.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; They are talking about deep things.
[1:39:15] Uhhuh. Let us go on to perfection.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; If you don't ever hear them,
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; how will you ever learn them?
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:33] Amen.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; You must be born
[1:39:38] into this message.
[1:39:41] Don't come one limb Catholic doctrine
[1:39:46] and then on this other side you want it
[1:39:49] to be in the message.
[1:39:51] In this side you've got a Baptist
[1:39:53] teaching
[1:39:55] and again this other side you want to
[1:39:57] come to the message. That's why you fail
[1:40:01] to bear fruit.
[1:40:06] Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN
[1:40:10] by the message of the hour.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [laughter]
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; He says now we are talking about now we
[1:40:23] are talking
[1:40:27] about baptisms
[1:40:30] and resurrection of the dead
[1:40:32] and laying of the hands
[1:40:35] and everything.
[1:40:37] But let us go ahead
[1:40:41] and talk about perfection.
[1:40:44] Now we are going to talk about when
[1:40:49] you COME INTO THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:40:53] AMEN. Now you've been hanging around the
[1:40:56] meeting a long time.
[1:41:00] Hallelujah. Hanging around the meeting.
[1:41:05] YOU COME into the overnight.
[1:41:07] BUT IT HAS TO BE. YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN
[1:41:13] ACCORDING to the message of the hour.
[1:41:18] Any branch in me,
[1:41:22] I will be responsible.
[1:41:25] WHEN IT DOESN'T BEAR FRUIT,
[1:41:28] I'll be responsible.
[1:41:31] I'll take it away.
[1:41:33] Amen. And if IT BEARS,
[1:41:37] I CONTINUE TO PARD IT,
[1:41:40] BUT IT BRINGS MORE FRUIT.
[1:41:43] He wants YOU TO COME TO a level where he
[1:41:47] becomes concerned
[1:41:50] and responsible.
[1:41:53] Amen. And you've seen those people,
[1:41:57] they'll stay around. They won't come in
[1:42:01] or go out.
[1:42:03] They appreciate the Holy Ghost. They
[1:42:06] will come around. Maybe the Holy Ghost
[1:42:08] do something
[1:42:10] and man, they will get up and shout and
[1:42:14] jump down the floor about it. But they
[1:42:18] never want to receive those things.
[1:42:22] And they will say, "Oh yes, that's good.
[1:42:26] I don't know how about that." Now
[1:42:30] borderline believers
[1:42:33] just so close
[1:42:35] they can test it
[1:42:41] they yet they don't receive it.
[1:42:47] They just test.
[1:42:50] They don't swallow.
[1:42:52] You swallow the whole thing
[1:42:56] and become a message believer.
[1:43:00] Amen.
[1:43:02] He says now they hang around like that
[1:43:04] so long
[1:43:07] till after a while
[1:43:09] they drift completely away
[1:43:13] TO RENEW THEM
[1:43:15] TO repentance there's no repentance for
[1:43:18] them.
[1:43:20] Amen. Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; We must own what we believe
[1:43:28] and be part of it. Oh, you always have
[1:43:32] long dresses.
[1:43:35] You always have long dresses.
[1:43:44] That is that is mommy.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, your mommy.
[1:43:51] Can't you trim this
[1:44:01] and we see them
[1:44:05] and you can't put them out
[1:44:09] because we are not legalist.
[1:44:14] You must be
[1:44:17] a branch
[1:44:19] born in him.
[1:44:24] We need to be identified
[1:44:28] as the two branches of John 15:2
[1:44:34] that carry his life
[1:44:36] because they are in him.
[1:44:40] Hallelujah.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The John 152 branches
[1:44:45] HAVE CERTAIN QUALITIES TO them
[1:44:49] that are synonymous with eternal life
[1:44:54] because the scriptures the branch in me.
[1:45:00] THAT MEANS THAT BRANCH is an elected
[1:45:03] branch.
[1:45:06] Therefore, it has eternal security.
[1:45:09] THE HUSBAND MAINTAINED AS THESE BRANCHES
[1:45:14] TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY MAY BRING FORTH
[1:45:17] FRUIT.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Elected branches.
[1:45:26] Now election means
[1:45:29] something chosen of God
[1:45:33] and this choosing
[1:45:35] is himself put out.
[1:45:39] Amen.
[1:45:40] A little form of attribute of himself
[1:45:45] into another body called you.
[1:45:49] Therefore you ARE THE SAME SOURCE.
[1:45:52] YOU ARE THE SAME LIFE.
[1:45:55] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. ELECTION
[1:45:59] MEANS THAT YOU attribute that was in
[1:46:03] him.
[1:46:05] BUT YOU ALLOW
[1:46:08] TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT BODY.
[1:46:11] THEREFORE, YOU WERE IN HIM BEFORE THE
[1:46:14] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. YOU ARE AN
[1:46:17] extension
[1:46:19] of who Christ is. [clears throat]
[1:46:22] Hallelujah.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; In a way,
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; we can say YOU ARE THE WOMB
[1:46:30] OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE CREATED
[1:46:35] TO BEAR FRUIT FOR HIM.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU MAY TAKE A LITTLE longer
[1:46:45] like Elizabeth,
[1:46:47] BUT JOHN THE BAPTIST, YOU MUST BE BORN.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU MAY TAKE A
[1:46:54] LITTLE LONG LIKE SAMUEL'S MAN. BUT THE
[1:46:59] RIGHT SEASON
[1:47:01] MUST be
[1:47:05] ah praise the Lord. That's where we are
[1:47:08] coming from.
[1:47:10] We must be the same source of life
[1:47:15] with the vine.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Let's go to first Peter
[1:47:20] chapter one
[1:47:22] verse.
[1:47:29] You know it's not good to be an old man.
[1:47:36] I'll ask some
[1:47:39] Steven, you want to be an old man?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; He says no.
[1:47:47] So you keep drinking here and here
[1:47:50] trying to keep yourself alive.
[1:47:59] So first Peter 1 verse 2
[1:48:04] he says elect
[1:48:08] according to the fornowledge of God the
[1:48:11] father
[1:48:17] you don't come
[1:48:19] as an accident
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; like I was teaching substance
[1:48:27] God knew you
[1:48:30] and your path.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; And whatever you needed,
[1:48:39] HE PUT IT ALONG THAT JOURNEY
[1:48:42] AS SUBSTANCE.
[1:48:45] FAITH IS THE SUBSTANCE
[1:48:48] OF THINGS HOPED FOR.
[1:48:50] YOU WALK INTO your substance.
[1:48:53] pull it down.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; SO, ELECT ACCORDING TO THE FULL
[1:48:59] KNOWLEDGE OF GOD THE FATHER.
[1:49:03] SO, God knew
[1:49:06] he would be here
[1:49:08] AS A BRANCH TO THE VINE.
[1:49:14] AMEN.
[1:49:16] through sanctification of THE SPIRIT
[1:49:20] and obedience
[1:49:23] and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
[1:49:25] Christ.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Grace unto you
[1:49:31] and peace be multiplied. HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:34] HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; HE HAS GOT AN UMBRELLA [screaming]
[1:49:39] OF PEACE
[1:49:41] AND GRACE over you.
[1:49:44] Amen.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; So according to full knowledge
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; OF GOD
[1:49:52] BY sanctification
[1:49:54] of your spirit.
[1:49:57] Now we come to these two branches.
[1:50:01] We have cast the other one away
[1:50:04] not caring where it falls.
[1:50:09] Now we are dealing with these two
[1:50:10] branches.
[1:50:14] NOW HE'S TALKING ACCORDING to the full
[1:50:17] knowledge of God
[1:50:21] by sanctification of your spirit.
[1:50:27] So this form of sanctification
[1:50:31] causes certain concerns in life.
[1:50:36] You are concerned.
[1:50:38] You care.
[1:50:40] There is something in you that causes
[1:50:43] you to care.
[1:50:46] Concerned about how you walk.
[1:50:49] Amen. Concerned about HOW [screaming]
[1:50:54] you are going to dress.
[1:50:58] If your dress
[1:51:00] causes any QUESTION
[1:51:05] in you DOES NOW THE HOLY GHOST
[1:51:10] SANCTIFYING your spirit
[1:51:13] leave it. Amen. My daughters would come
[1:51:18] with certain dresses
[1:51:21] that daddy this one HERE IF IT OFFENDS
[1:51:25] you in any way if it causes a question
[1:51:28] in any way
[1:51:30] sanctification of spirit.
[1:51:36] NOW HE'S PREPARING you to THE FACT
[1:51:41] THAT YOU may bear fruit.
[1:51:47] IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN QUESTIONS
[1:51:50] ABOUT your hairstyle,
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; DROP IT
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S NOW YOUR HOLY SPIRIT,
[1:51:57] YOUR ASSIAN spirit
[1:52:00] being sanctified.
[1:52:03] Amen. You get concerned over this, you
[1:52:06] get concerned over that. YOU GET
[1:52:09] CONCERNED OVER how you deal with your
[1:52:10] husband or your wife. IF YOU HAVE THOSE
[1:52:14] QUESTION IS God
[1:52:17] bringing caution
[1:52:20] to your human spirit
[1:52:23] is deal WITH SANCTIFICATION OF SPIRIT.
[1:52:27] You do a daily sanctification
[1:52:31] because you have chosen to live under
[1:52:33] the blood.
[1:52:36] Hallelujah. If you are a man AND YOU
[1:52:40] BEGIN TO ASK,
[1:52:42] how about this one here? Is it tight?
[1:52:46] You know, many times we talk about the
[1:52:48] the women,
[1:52:50] but the men
[1:52:53] they are getting their 12 tighter.
[1:53:01] When you come to ask
[1:53:05] SANCTIFICATION OF SPIRIT
[1:53:08] YOU PUT IT OUT
[1:53:10] because your spirit
[1:53:13] should not have questions.
[1:53:17] IF THE QUESTIONS ARE THERE, THE HOLY
[1:53:20] SPIRIT is trying to clean it.
[1:53:26] Elect according to the fornowledge.
[1:53:30] And this election
[1:53:33] speaks of eternal security.
[1:53:38] Are you together with me? Because
[1:53:41] election
[1:53:42] is that you came
[1:53:46] from him
[1:53:48] as a little gene
[1:53:51] and you were kept in a box
[1:53:56] which is called you
[1:53:58] and because you have got an attribute of
[1:54:01] the father.
[1:54:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Put in YOU THEN THE SECURITY OF GOD
[1:54:10] will watch over that body.
[1:54:14] [screaming] Hallelujah.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. YOU MAY TAKE A LONG
[1:54:19] TIME WHEN YOU ARE NOT bearing fruit.
[1:54:23] BUT A TIME WILL COME and God will order
[1:54:28] man TO GO AND PULL YOU OUT OF THE FIRE
[1:54:33] LIKE JOSHUA THE PRIEST.
[1:54:35] AND BRING YOU HERE so that YOU MAY BE
[1:54:38] WASHED AND THEN be dressed AND BECOME A
[1:54:42] PRIEST with God.
[1:54:49] That means abiding presence
[1:54:53] because you are a branch in him
[1:54:57] that must bring forth fruit.
[1:55:02] AMEN. HE SAYS, "EVERY [screaming]
[1:55:04] BRANCH in me,
[1:55:08] amen, that beareth not fruit,
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; he taketh away."
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Notice the setting of that verse.
[1:55:22] HE SAYS EVERY BRANCH in me
[1:55:27] it means
[1:55:29] that this branch here
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; is not grafted.
[1:55:36] It is
[1:55:38] an original branch
[1:55:41] and an original BRANCH
[1:55:44] ROSE from inside
[1:55:47] and comes the outside.
[1:55:52] is different
[1:55:54] from verse six
[1:55:57] if a man abides not in me.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; So there is A WAY A BRANCH in him
[1:56:09] may for a season bear no fruit.
[1:56:14] But he does not cast it away
[1:56:17] like the one of verse six
[1:56:21] because he can't cut his own life.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; He cannot cut off I mean his own
[1:56:30] you know attribute
[1:56:33] in the garden.
[1:56:35] This man ADAM
[1:56:38] HE COMES here and he finds Eve there and
[1:56:42] the serpent there.
[1:56:44] Do you think Adam
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; would walk back home
[1:56:49] and he says, "I don't care."
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; He had to redeem
[1:56:57] his branch.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; He had to go IN
[1:57:04] AND REDEEM his branch.
[1:57:07] SO,
[1:57:09] RESTORE HEART TO ME.
[1:57:12] AMEN.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Did you come from God?
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; You are in the wrong corner.
[1:57:25] He walks towards you this morning.
[1:57:30] He wants to restore you.
[1:57:33] Praise the Lord. Let's talk about the
[1:57:36] vine.
[1:57:40] To fully understand verse two,
[1:57:44] we must remind ourselves
[1:57:47] that we are not dealing with a tree.
[1:57:51] We are dealing with a vine.
[1:57:54] A vine is a creeper.
[1:57:58] And for it to bear good fruit,
[1:58:02] it must be taken away.
[1:58:07] And this taken away
[1:58:10] in the Greek let
[1:58:13] it doesn't mean to cut off
[1:58:17] it means to lift
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; like you know people who know how to
[1:58:27] farm tomatoes
[1:58:30] so that they may not rot
[1:58:34] They always try to bring some kind of
[1:58:37] poles
[1:58:39] and they cause
[1:58:42] those tomatoes to go around that pole.
[1:58:47] Have you seen that
[1:58:51] is taking away?
[1:58:58] Are you together with me now?
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A BRANCH TAKEN AWAY.
[1:59:05] IS NOT A BRANCH CUT OFF.
[1:59:09] IT'S A [screaming] BRANCH TAKEN AWAY
[1:59:12] SO THAT IT may bear.
[1:59:16] The passion fruit
[1:59:20] is a vine is the vine.
[1:59:25] You know when you let it flow on the
[1:59:27] ground,
[1:59:30] it can bring FORTH SOME FRUIT.
[1:59:33] BUT IF YOU TAKE IT AWAY,
[1:59:38] it will be able to bear more.
[1:59:42] So he CARES
[1:59:45] FOR both branches
[1:59:48] in John 15:2.
[1:59:52] The statement take away
[1:59:56] means TO LIVE
[1:59:59] so that it can fairly bear good fruit
[2:00:05] in the Greek lexical.
[2:00:10] You see, every branch in me
[2:00:15] that beareth no fruit,
[2:00:18] he taketh away.
[2:00:21] So it only makes sense
[2:00:25] when you know
[2:00:28] the vine
[2:00:30] is a creeper
[2:00:35] is not talking about a tree
[2:00:38] are you together with me.
[2:00:41] The branch
[2:00:43] in the is, you know, which is not
[2:00:45] bearing fruit.
[2:00:48] It's in the category
[2:00:51] of a lamp
[2:00:53] that is lit
[2:00:55] and put on the bush.
[2:00:59] It doesn't mean it cannot produce light,
[2:01:04] but the environment around it
[2:01:08] is trying to hamper the light.
[2:01:12] So God only removes the bush
[2:01:17] AND THEN THE LIGHT CAN COVER THE HOUSE.
[2:01:21] AMEN. This first BRANCH
[2:01:26] that cannot BEAR UP FRUIT,
[2:01:28] IT DOESN'T mean it can never
[2:01:32] just the circumstance.
[2:01:36] God wants to begin to deal with your
[2:01:39] circumstance
[2:01:41] to the effect THAT YOU MAY BRING FORTH.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Sometimes in teaching
[2:01:51] we deal
[2:01:53] with English statements
[2:01:56] that are used interchangeably
[2:02:00] in certain verses.
[2:02:02] And if you do not get careful,
[2:02:06] you start contradicting yourself.
[2:02:11] I will take an example of Matthew 11:28.
[2:02:15] I'll take you there. Next time if the
[2:02:18] Lord permits,
[2:02:20] we shall talk about rest.
[2:02:24] How many people are seeking to rest
[2:02:27] who are like Ruth?
[2:02:29] They are seeking to rest.
[2:02:33] Amen. Amen. So in Matthew 11:28,
[2:02:39] he says, "COME UNTO ME,
[2:02:42] oh ye that labor,
[2:02:46] and that makes labor negative
[2:02:52] and are heavy
[2:02:55] and I'll give you rest."
[2:03:00] And we follow the concept of rest.
[2:03:05] And we got to Hebrews chapter 4
[2:03:08] verse 10. For he that is entered into
[2:03:12] his rest,
[2:03:15] he has also seized from his own works,
[2:03:20] as God did from his.
[2:03:24] Let us LABOR THEREFORE.
[2:03:28] NOW THE WORD labor here
[2:03:31] becomes positive.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; So if you don't get careful,
[2:03:41] you kind of hit the people's head.
[2:03:46] He says, "Let us labor therefore
[2:03:49] enter the rest
[2:03:51] lest any man fall after the same example
[2:03:55] of
[2:03:58] So we need to vis now the word labor.
[2:04:04] Labor in Matthew 11:28
[2:04:09] it means to grow weary.
[2:04:15] It means tired
[2:04:18] with toil and burdens and grief.
[2:04:24] bodily labor
[2:04:27] just like Israel was in Egypt.
[2:04:32] So in Matthew
[2:04:34] he was calling Israel
[2:04:37] from the grievous labor of the law.
[2:04:44] They had labored WITH THE LAW
[2:04:47] and they HAD HARVESTED NOTHING.
[2:04:50] SO WHEN JESUS CAME, he says, "Come unto
[2:04:53] me all you who labor
[2:04:56] and I'll give you rest."
[2:04:58] So when YOU DEAL with labor
[2:05:01] in Hebrews 4:11
[2:05:05] again seems to contradict Matthew 4, I
[2:05:08] mean Matthew 11:28.
[2:05:13] If you don't go
[2:05:16] and try to understand
[2:05:19] the concept of labor in Hebrews 41,
[2:05:24] he says, "Let us labor therefore
[2:05:28] to enter into the rest."
[2:05:31] SO DEALING with grammar,
[2:05:34] one would wonder
[2:05:36] why Christ would give rest freely
[2:05:41] and Paul would put forth labor first.
[2:05:48] Are you together with me?
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise God. So you know the word
[2:05:56] to labor in Hebrews 4:11
[2:06:01] is interpreted to mean being diligent
[2:06:09] to
[2:06:13] meaning
[2:06:18] and take the rest.
[2:06:21] Are you together with me?
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; So it would mean if you are not careful.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; It would mean that you want TAKE THE
[2:06:33] PEOPLE BACK again
[2:06:36] in trying to search for the Holy Ghost
[2:06:39] to go to the mountain
[2:06:41] to go to the forest.
[2:06:44] I don't know who taught the people
[2:06:47] that the Holy Ghost comes on mountains.
[2:06:55] and they go into forests
[2:06:58] to endanger their lives
[2:07:02] while searching for the Holy Ghost.
[2:07:05] They are back in labor
[2:07:10] when Christ gave us rest.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why the Greek
[2:07:21] translation
[2:07:24] for the branch is taken away
[2:07:28] does not mean to be cut.
[2:07:33] LET'S READ THE VERSE.
[2:07:35] EVERY BRANCH IN me
[2:07:39] that beareth not fruit,
[2:07:42] he taketh away.
[2:07:48] meaning he lifts it.
[2:07:53] He taketh away
[2:07:56] is NOT JUDGMENT TO THE branch
[2:08:01] but rather to raise it
[2:08:04] to elevate it to lift it in a wider
[2:08:09] sense.
[2:08:12] It is to TAKE UPON
[2:08:19] THE condition
[2:08:21] one has been raised to
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; so that he can bear fruit.
[2:08:32] So this morning service
[2:08:36] we are trying to help that branch
[2:08:41] and tell that branch
[2:08:44] that you are not rejected.
[2:08:48] But God brings you here
[2:08:50] every Sunday EVERY WEDNESDAY TO LIFT YOU
[2:08:55] SO THAT YOU CAN bear fruit.
[2:09:00] So you TAKE SERIOUS
[2:09:03] EVERY word that is given to you here is
[2:09:06] instructing you on how you can bear
[2:09:08] fruit.
[2:09:12] Amen. In that sense it is Christ being
[2:09:16] the good shepherd.
[2:09:19] IT IS CHRIST GOING AFTER THE I mean the
[2:09:22] one lost and you know
[2:09:25] and that when he finds it he takes it
[2:09:29] into the past.
[2:09:32] Are you together with me? In that sense,
[2:09:36] God is not an Indian giver
[2:09:42] and is not trying. And in that way, he
[2:09:45] does not encourage you to do evil.
[2:09:52] He's only giving the principle of how he
[2:09:55] works.
[2:09:59] If I come here and preach
[2:10:03] to threaten you,
[2:10:05] it will not help you
[2:10:08] because there is no power in there. But
[2:10:10] when I tell you the principle
[2:10:13] and you accept THE PRINCIPLE, THERE IS
[2:10:16] POWER in the principle.
[2:10:22] Are you together with me? THERE IS POWER
[2:10:24] IN THE PRINCIPLE.
[2:10:27] THE LAW HAD AS IT was
[2:10:34] it didn't change the character of the
[2:10:36] people.
[2:10:39] He has to lift the branch.
[2:10:44] Listen to this quote
[2:10:47] from the Hebrew chap I mean Hebrew chap
[2:10:51] I mean chapter 6 part three.
[2:10:55] The message of brother brother
[2:10:58] listen
[2:11:00] this message
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; belongs to the elect
[2:11:06] and he listens it to it
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; by the ear
[2:11:12] not by the ears
[2:11:14] but by the ear
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; of the inner seed.
[2:11:23] Amen.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; If a man puts an interpretation
[2:11:30] to the instruction of the spirit,
[2:11:35] then you know he might be verse six.
[2:11:44] Listen
[2:11:46] this is the message
[2:11:48] Hebrews as I've already said. He said
[2:11:52] you will make mistakes.
[2:11:57] He's talking about the good br I mean
[2:11:59] the good branch.
[2:12:01] You'll fall.
[2:12:04] You will do wrong.
[2:12:10] You'll go out sometimes and do things.
[2:12:15] That doesn't mean you are lost.
[2:12:20] And this is meaning
[2:12:23] don't go and do them.
[2:12:30] [laughter]
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; That means
[2:12:33] you are going to get correction.
[2:12:38] My little boy
[2:12:41] lots of time
[2:12:44] my children will do things
[2:12:47] yours do also.
[2:12:50] They know that is against your rules
[2:12:57] and they know what happens when they do
[2:13:01] it.
[2:13:04] They are going to get a whipping for it.
[2:13:09] But still
[2:13:12] it is your child.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; It's impossible
[2:13:18] for that man to ever be God again.
[2:13:26] That's was been born of eternal life.
[2:13:34] THAT ONE CAN'T BE THROWN AWAY.
[2:13:38] CANNOT BE THROWN AWAY.
[2:13:41] BUT THE ONE OF SIX
[2:13:43] is cast away
[2:13:46] not caring where he falls.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "God
[2:13:57] is not an Indian GIVER
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; WHO gives
[2:14:02] and then takes away.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; I'm getting Indian uh tenants in my
[2:14:13] place.
[2:14:16] But you really need to understand them.
[2:14:20] The way they understand
[2:14:22] they are accepting
[2:14:24] and they are saying no. Sometimes when
[2:14:27] they are saying no, they are saying yes.
[2:14:31] But they are trying to play on your
[2:14:33] mind.
[2:14:35] God does not play on your mind.
[2:14:39] Once you are born
[2:14:42] that branch in me,
[2:14:46] it cannot be unborn.
[2:14:57] [laughter]
[2:15:03] I will I will be I will unparent you.
[2:15:08] That's a very angry father.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; So whatever he does he does it but that
[2:15:16] does not mean that your DNA has changed.
[2:15:23] [laughter]
[2:15:24] Are you together with me? So this is
[2:15:26] what BROTHER BRHAM SAID. IF GOD has
[2:15:30] given you eternal life,
[2:15:34] it is not everlasting,
[2:15:42] but it is eternal
[2:15:45] and is not GIVING IT TO YOU NOW.
[2:15:50] HALLELUJAH. THE GENE ON THE INSIDE IS
[2:15:54] GIVEN ANOTHER BODY. YOU ARE AN EXTENSION
[2:15:58] OF JESUS CHRIST.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; So he that heareth my word
[2:16:09] and believeth on him that sent me
[2:16:13] everlasting life. I shall never come to
[2:16:16] JUDGMENT BUT IS PASSED FROM death unto
[2:16:19] life with him upon the last day.
[2:16:24] Amen. SO WHAT GOD DOES,
[2:16:28] HE DEALS WITH THE BRANCH
[2:16:31] IN JOHN 15:2,
[2:16:34] HE TAKETH AWAY.
[2:16:36] He just lifts it.
[2:16:40] OKAY? HE DOESN'T CAST IT AWAY BECAUSE IT
[2:16:44] has his own life in the air.
[2:16:50] Amen. He deals with the circumstances
[2:16:53] AROUND THE BRANCH.
[2:16:56] THAT HINDERS IT TO BEAR FRUIT.
[2:17:00] Oh hallelujah.
[2:17:02] HE INSPECTS OUR CHARACTER.
[2:17:05] AMEN. Searches our hearts.
[2:17:09] INSPECTS OUR FAMILIES.
[2:17:11] He inspects our areas OF INTEREST.
[2:17:15] WHAT IS HINDERING THIS BRANCH
[2:17:18] TO BEAR A THREAT?
[2:17:20] OH HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SOMETIMES
[2:17:23] they are shortteered.
[2:17:26] Sometimes they've got some kind of an
[2:17:29] inferiority complex.
[2:17:33] Sometimes they've got a superiority
[2:17:35] complex.
[2:17:38] IT BLOCKS THE GOING IN OF THE SEA.
[2:17:42] IT BLOCKS THE LIFE FLOW SOMEWHERE.
[2:17:46] So he wants to drill that area.
[2:17:51] SO THAT his life
[2:17:54] could GO TO THE POINT
[2:17:57] WHERE THE BRANCH BRINGETH FORTH FRUIT.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[2:18:04] he wants to inspect our families.
[2:18:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; And then a minister will say things TO
[2:18:12] BRING CORRECTION
[2:18:14] TO the man. And the man if he's the
[2:18:18] seed, HE HAS GOT THE COMPONENT IN THERE
[2:18:23] that can hear the father.
[2:18:26] And the moment he begins to change,
[2:18:30] then life begins to come into the
[2:18:32] father.
[2:18:34] The fruit becomes evident.
[2:18:38] He inspects our areas of interest.
[2:18:42] Do we spend most of our time?
[2:18:46] watching European League
[2:18:50] instead of at least visiting the word.
[2:18:54] HE GOES to the little details
[2:18:58] ABOUT THIS BRANCH BECAUSE IT MUST BRING
[2:19:02] FRESH.
[2:19:05] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. The husband man
[2:19:07] does not cut it off
[2:19:10] because he's not interested
[2:19:12] just to cut branches.
[2:19:16] Where will the profit of the FRUIT COME
[2:19:18] FROM?
[2:19:20] When you cut off ALL THE BRANCHES,
[2:19:23] what he does. Amen. He starts to do
[2:19:26] certain THINGS
[2:19:29] FIRST OF all to improve the soil health.
[2:19:34] Hallelujah. And in that condition
[2:19:38] talking about the heart condition of a
[2:19:40] believer.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Let us go to Luke
[2:19:48] chapter 13.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; He cares that you bring forth fruit.
[2:19:59] Doctor is that. Amen.
[2:20:04] He cares.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; You are the bride
[2:20:12] and every lady
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; would desire to have a child.
[2:20:22] She went before this priest
[2:20:26] and she was acting in a very funny way.
[2:20:31] She was praying in the heart
[2:20:34] and then the mouth began to to mimic
[2:20:38] until the priest felt that this woman
[2:20:43] had come into the house drunk.
[2:20:48] A real woman will care to bring fruit.
[2:20:57] Amen.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; So Luke 13:6
[2:21:05] HE SPOKE ALSO THIS PARABLE. A CERTAIN
[2:21:08] man had a fig tree planted in his
[2:21:11] vineyard and he came and sought fruit
[2:21:14] thereon and found none.
[2:21:29] Verse seven. Then said he to the dresser
[2:21:34] of his vineard,
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; behold these years,
[2:21:40] I have come seeking fruit on this fig
[2:21:43] tree
[2:21:48] and find none.
[2:21:50] cut it down.
[2:21:52] Why come it to the ground?
[2:21:58] And the dresser answering said that to
[2:22:02] the Lord,
[2:22:05] Lord,
[2:22:07] let it alone this year also.
[2:22:11] I shall dig about it
[2:22:14] and dang it,
[2:22:18] and if it bear fruit,
[2:22:21] Well, if not
[2:22:24] then then it will be
[2:22:27] verse six.
[2:22:29] We shall cast it away not caring where
[2:22:33] it falls.
[2:22:39] Amen.
[2:22:45] The vine dresser.
[2:22:48] The vine dresser
[2:22:52] had special redemptive attributes
[2:22:59] that cared for the branch
[2:23:02] that could not bring forth fruit.
[2:23:06] He was Moses to his people.
[2:23:12] MOSES,
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; GET AWAY that I may destroy them. Moses
[2:23:18] would get right
[2:23:20] and he says why do you kill them? If you
[2:23:23] are going to THE PEOPLE WOULD SAY
[2:23:26] THERE ARE NO enough graves in Egypt
[2:23:29] for burying these people that would
[2:23:32] bring them in the wilderness and kill
[2:23:34] them here. Okay.
[2:23:38] Moses
[2:23:42] and this Moses
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; is the burden of your pastor. HE'S
[2:23:48] TRYING TO SAY, "LORD, HELP THEM
[2:23:53] THAT they may bring forth fruit."
[2:23:56] IN HIS PRAYER, LORD, HELP THEM
[2:23:59] THAT you may bear fruit. AND IF YOU HANA
[2:24:04] THE MAN OF SAM SAMUEL
[2:24:08] AND YOU ARE DESPERATE ON THEIR SIDE
[2:24:11] AND THE DRESSER IS DESPERATE ON THEIR
[2:24:13] SIDE, there will be fruit
[2:24:17] upon fruit upon fruit in this church.
[2:24:25] The dresser,
[2:24:27] he knows what to do. He will do the
[2:24:30] mounting
[2:24:33] of HUV
[2:24:35] saying maybe
[2:24:36] the moisture goes out very fast.
[2:24:40] We must find ways of retaining moisture
[2:24:45] THAT THE BRANCH
[2:24:47] can bring forth fruit.
[2:24:50] He taketh away
[2:24:55] that
[2:24:56] it may bear fruit.
[2:25:01] God himself
[2:25:04] causes the revival.
[2:25:07] Hallelujah.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Hebrews and we look at
[2:25:11] Israel.
[2:25:14] Don't mind.
[2:25:17] I'm trying my best
[2:25:20] to get to the third branch
[2:25:24] and then I mean yeah on the second the
[2:25:27] third branch and then we are gone.
[2:25:30] [snorts]
[2:25:31] Praise God.
[2:25:34] We've dealt with the one which is cast
[2:25:37] away.
[2:25:39] We are dealing with this one which is
[2:25:41] taken away.
[2:25:44] But yet
[2:25:46] we've got the third branch
[2:25:49] which the pastors love.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; Which the pastor calls the church.
[2:26:00] It bears fruit
[2:26:02] but it is parched to bring more fruit.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:26:12] Amen.
[2:26:13] Okay. Hebrews 8:9.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; Not according to the covenant that I
[2:26:20] made with their fathers
[2:26:23] in the day when I took them by the hand
[2:26:27] to lead them out of the land of Egypt.
[2:26:42] because they continued not in my
[2:26:46] covenant.
[2:26:48] I regarded them not, says the Lord.
[2:26:58] But that was not the end of God
[2:27:01] with Israel because they had his life.
[2:27:09] You see, this is where my emphasis is
[2:27:13] seek
[2:27:14] to be born again.
[2:27:18] He cares for the two branches.
[2:27:21] The third one, he doesn't care.
[2:27:27] Verse 10. For this is the covenant I
[2:27:30] will make with the house of Israel
[2:27:34] after those days.
[2:27:41] Says the Lord,
[2:27:43] I'll put my laws into their mind.
[2:27:50] is beginning to [screaming] lift the
[2:27:52] branch
[2:27:55] and write them in their heart.
[2:27:59] And I'll be to them a god
[2:28:03] and they shall be to me a people
[2:28:08] in separable.
[2:28:12] He just improves
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; the CONDITION OF THE SOIL.
[2:28:20] THE HEART.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SHALL NOT TEACH every man his
[2:28:26] neighbor.
[2:28:29] Hallelujah.
[2:28:31] AND EVERY MAN HIS BROTHER,
[2:28:34] SAYING, "Know the Lord.
[2:28:37] They shall know me
[2:28:39] from the least to THE GREATEST."
[2:28:43] HOW CAN THAT BE POSSIBLE? I [screaming]
[2:28:46] WILL CAUSE THEM. I WILL LIFT THEM. LET
[2:28:51] THE WEAK ONE SAY I AM STRONG.
[2:28:56] Praise God.
[2:28:58] THAT'S GOD DEALING WITH THE ELECT.
[2:29:02] SO THE BRANCH IN HIM
[2:29:04] THAT BEARETH no fruit, he will instill
[2:29:08] hunger
[2:29:11] and thirst
[2:29:13] for the word. He put you in A STATE
[2:29:17] WHERE YOU CAN BEAR FRUIT.
[2:29:20] AMEN. HE DOES [screaming] THAT.
[2:29:24] OH, PRAISE GOD. Does he put new laws?
[2:29:30] No sir. That lifts you,
[2:29:34] lifts your spirit.
[2:29:36] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. This will not
[2:29:38] be putting a new law
[2:29:42] but rather coming forth of Christ in the
[2:29:46] individual lives of the people.
[2:29:50] He comes down to make the capstone
[2:29:54] revelation of Christ
[2:29:56] REAL IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE.
[2:30:01] Do you love him? And it's THIS THAT WILL
[2:30:05] CHANGE THE HEART CONDITION.
[2:30:08] THE PERSON OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[2:30:11] And when he's inside there, he begins TO
[2:30:15] COME
[2:30:16] AS THE latter rain
[2:30:19] to WATER THAT BRANCH.
[2:30:22] AND THEN something in THERE
[2:30:25] BEGINS TO FORM FORTH,
[2:30:28] THE LIFE of [screaming] Christ,
[2:30:31] and then we bring forth fruit.
[2:30:35] BECAUSE JOHN 15
[2:30:38] is a harvest season.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] Hallelujah.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; It's not a sewing season.
[2:30:48] It's a harvest season.
[2:30:50] SO GOD CARES,
[2:30:52] BUT you bear fruit.
[2:30:56] He cares lift you
[2:30:59] to raise you to the occasion.
[2:31:03] All the messages you hear are for the
[2:31:06] intent
[2:31:08] that you become desperate
[2:31:11] to become a mother.
[2:31:15] Amen. IF YOU ARE DESPERATE
[2:31:19] AND the minister is desperate,
[2:31:22] there will be a harvest.
[2:31:27] Amen.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God does not only put the
[2:31:33] principles of redemption
[2:31:36] and leave them there.
[2:31:40] He makes sure that he gets the child of
[2:31:45] he has come to redeem
[2:31:48] connecting to those principles.
[2:31:53] I'll give you a quote.
[2:31:56] The pastor just you know went through it
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; during the you know broadcast on the
[2:32:03] church ages. [snorts]
[2:32:06] He says in the book of Ludicia
[2:32:10] these things says the faithful and true
[2:32:13] witness.
[2:32:17] Now I am to show you what I find
[2:32:22] in the thought of faithful.
[2:32:25] You know we often take talk about a
[2:32:29] great unchanging God
[2:32:34] whose word
[2:32:36] does not change.
[2:32:39] And when we speak of him after that
[2:32:42] manner, we often get a view
[2:32:47] of him that makes him seem very
[2:32:51] impersonal.
[2:33:00] For me, I died for them. I worked. I did
[2:33:02] my work. My part is up to them.
[2:33:06] If they don't bear fruit, that's what
[2:33:08] you think.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; But God
[2:33:12] lifts the branch.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; But you must come to a point
[2:33:21] where you are desperate for a child.
[2:33:27] Amen.
[2:33:29] Amen.
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:31] So it is as though God made a way of
[2:33:35] salvation
[2:33:38] for lost mankind
[2:33:41] that way being the cross.
[2:33:46] And then when the death of Christ was
[2:33:49] atoned for our sins
[2:33:52] and his resurrection gave us an open
[2:33:54] door,
[2:33:56] God just folded his arms
[2:34:00] and stood back.
[2:34:09] That's not the God we serve.
[2:34:16] He cares about you.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; Just turn around and tell your brother,
[2:34:22] "God cares
[2:34:26] that you bear fruit."
[2:34:29] Amen.
[2:34:31] [laughter]
[2:34:32] He says it's as if we major
[2:34:38] in believing in a great creator
[2:34:42] who having created
[2:34:45] lost personal interest in his creation.
[2:34:55] He created you but did not love you.
[2:34:59] That's how you see.
[2:35:02] That's why you say
[2:35:05] I wish I could bear fruit.
[2:35:09] Do you think it is easy?
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; God cares
[2:35:13] that you bring forth fruit.
[2:35:17] THE PROPHET SAYS NOW I say that's how
[2:35:21] too many people
[2:35:23] are up TO THINK
[2:35:26] BUT THAT is the wrong THINKING
[2:35:29] FOR GOD IS GOVERNING in the affairs of
[2:35:32] men right now.
[2:35:36] He's both creator
[2:35:38] and sustainer.
[2:35:41] Hallelujah.
[2:35:42] Praise God. So let us go to THE THIRD
[2:35:45] BRANCH.
[2:35:48] THE THIRD BRANCH.
[2:35:50] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. The branch which
[2:35:52] bears fruit
[2:35:55] but still God does not fold HIS HAND.
[2:36:00] AH, THAT'S a wonderful branch.
[2:36:04] Every day I go and pick about 10
[2:36:06] tomatoes.
[2:36:09] No, he still says, "I'm very interested
[2:36:14] THAT YOU MAY BRING MORE FRUIT.
[2:36:18] HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; DON'T LOOK AT YOURSELF AND YOU THINK I'M
[2:36:23] BETTER than so and so until God cares
[2:36:27] about YOU BRINGING MORE FRUIT.
[2:36:32] AMEN. So John 15:2
[2:36:35] has another branch
[2:36:38] AND THIS IS THE branch as I say
[2:36:40] which the pastors are very interested in
[2:36:44] and it's the only branch
[2:36:47] that recognizes itself
[2:36:50] as church
[2:36:52] because it bears fruit.
[2:36:55] It carries a testimony.
[2:36:58] The street knows who they are. So the
[2:37:01] fruit of the spirit
[2:37:03] is manifested in them.
[2:37:06] It is not looked for.
[2:37:09] It is manifested.
[2:37:11] Amen. Some of the things they attend
[2:37:15] every service.
[2:37:17] They are not Sunday service believers.
[2:37:21] They attend the communion.
[2:37:24] They pay their tithes.
[2:37:27] They you know have settled families.
[2:37:31] They listen to the taste. They testify
[2:37:34] around the field.
[2:37:36] They dress in a reasonable manner.
[2:37:40] THEY ARE A BRANCH
[2:37:42] THAT BEARS FRUIT.
[2:37:44] AND THE PASTOR IS ALWAYS PROUD OF THOSE.
[2:37:49] BUT I WANT TELL THE PASTOR EVEN THOSE
[2:37:52] STRUGGLING THEY ARE STILL his sheep.
[2:38:00] Hallelujah.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; I've been a pastor and I know what I'm
[2:38:04] talking about.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; SO EVERY BRANCH THAT BEAR FRUIT, he
[2:38:11] purges it.
[2:38:13] That it may bring forth more fruit.
[2:38:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So I want the
[2:38:20] good branches
[2:38:23] to pay attention to me THIS MORNING.
[2:38:26] I SOMETIMES SAY, "I've got a good
[2:38:29] family.
[2:38:31] My family comes to church." You know, we
[2:38:34] we are not beggars around the church.
[2:38:38] We've got a good job.
[2:38:40] YES, THAT'S RIGHT. But I want talk to
[2:38:44] you. You are forgetting the other part
[2:38:48] that he wants to p you
[2:38:52] may bring more fruit.
[2:38:55] Amen.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; This is a bearing branch
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; that testifies to the life of Christ
[2:39:08] and the CHARACTER OF THE PARENT seed
[2:39:13] which is Christ himself.
[2:39:15] IT IS AN EXPRESSION
[2:39:18] OF THE EXTENSION
[2:39:20] OF CHRIST.
[2:39:22] BUT HE MAKES sure that that branch
[2:39:26] MAKES YOU KNOW KEPT pugged
[2:39:30] to bring more fruit.
[2:39:33] So this ping
[2:39:36] listen friends is different from the
[2:39:39] ping of Calvary.
[2:39:46] Amen. where all the two branches
[2:39:51] were washed.
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; This is an individual py.
[2:40:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And when we talk about PY
[2:40:06] MOST people relate it to chastisement
[2:40:10] of Hebrews chapter 12
[2:40:13] which is also could be another FORM OF P
[2:40:18] BUT I WANT TO DEAL WITH THE WORD. THE
[2:40:21] WORD,
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; the washing waters of the world
[2:40:28] to make you brighter
[2:40:30] and better that you may be able to bring
[2:40:34] forth fruit
[2:40:36] because you are already
[2:40:38] a fruitbearing branch.
[2:40:42] But in you God's interest
[2:40:46] is more fruit.
[2:40:48] Amen. You know our pastor is a farmer.
[2:40:52] He has got cows. Some give this milk.
[2:40:57] Some give this much. You know it doesn't
[2:41:00] matter when the one which gives small
[2:41:03] liters
[2:41:05] drops by two liters.
[2:41:08] is more concerned
[2:41:10] about this one here than the other one
[2:41:14] which naturally brings little meat.
[2:41:17] Is that true pastor? So the CONCERN OF
[2:41:20] GOD
[2:41:22] IS SPECIAL on the branch that bears.
[2:41:27] He wants to talk to you
[2:41:30] so that you may bring more fruit.
[2:41:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What God does,
[2:41:36] HE WANTS TO IMPROVE
[2:41:39] THE QUALITY of production.
[2:41:43] Amen. This ping
[2:41:46] is NOT INTENDED TO have to inflict pain
[2:41:51] on the branch, but rather to improve
[2:41:56] the quality of production.
[2:42:01] He purges.
[2:42:04] Amen. HE PUNCHES THAT branch
[2:42:09] by separating.
[2:42:12] Amen. Two elements.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; He separates the soul.
[2:42:20] and spirit
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; so that you can live
[2:42:25] conscious of your soul
[2:42:29] and improves
[2:42:32] on the quality of your human spirit.
[2:42:37] Hallelujah. HE GOES INTO THE SIGHT OF
[2:42:40] life
[2:42:42] with the word
[2:42:44] and splits the atone.
[2:42:47] THREADS THE SOUL AND SPIRIT.
[2:42:51] Then deals
[2:42:53] with the character of spirit
[2:42:56] in areas
[2:42:58] where it affects
[2:43:01] more production.
[2:43:06] Let's go to Hebrews chapter 4.
[2:43:10] Are you praying with me?
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; My children were saying, "Are you going
[2:43:17] to preach?
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; Are you going to preach?"
[2:43:23] Let me tell you,
[2:43:25] if it were possible,
[2:43:28] I would preach
[2:43:31] and say, "Good night.
[2:43:35] God bless you.
[2:43:37] It would be good.
[2:43:42] What can I do if I don't preach?
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; You get healed today.
[2:43:50] You get healed today. You go to office
[2:43:53] tomorrow
[2:43:55] who asks you, "Are you going to office?
[2:43:59] Are you going to office?"
[2:44:01] The pastor was calling me, "Will you
[2:44:03] really be able
[2:44:08] It's always been grace.
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; I want to take you to Hebrews here
[2:44:16] chapter 4
[2:44:18] and verse 12.
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; For the word
[2:44:24] of God is quick.
[2:44:29] Now in developing the quality
[2:44:36] He deals
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; with this branch
[2:44:41] by the word
[2:44:45] because this branch is a believer.
[2:44:50] [laughter] That's why he brings forth
[2:44:52] fruit
[2:44:54] because he's a believer.
[2:44:57] Amen.
[2:44:59] &gt;&gt; He allows the washing waters of the
[2:45:02] world
[2:45:05] So I know whom I'm talking to.
[2:45:09] I'm talking to the part of church
[2:45:13] that the pastor is proud of.
[2:45:19] For the WORD OF GOD IS quick
[2:45:23] and powerful and sharper than any
[2:45:26] two-edged sword.
[2:45:29] He has seen given to the dividing
[2:45:35] of soul and spirit
[2:45:39] and of joints and marrow
[2:45:42] AND IS A DISCERNER
[2:45:45] OF THE thoughts and the intents of the
[2:45:47] heart.
[2:45:49] So that is the process
[2:45:53] of purging the branch.
[2:45:57] The word goes in there
[2:46:00] to divide the soul
[2:46:03] AND SPIRIT AND BEGINS to inspect that.
[2:46:10] Is there a way we can improve on the
[2:46:13] quality of production?
[2:46:17] Yes, I've been very faithful.
[2:46:20] Father, what else can I do?
[2:46:24] You see, you don't sit back.
[2:46:26] And you are so complicent.
[2:46:29] And he says, "Who doesn't know
[2:46:32] what I've been around here? I have done
[2:46:36] this. I have done this and I've done
[2:46:37] that."
[2:46:41] You can't get complicit.
[2:46:44] He says you must grow more fruit.
[2:46:51] Amen. So he concentrates on this
[2:46:54] department.
[2:46:57] Amen. He goes and brings the word
[2:47:01] to the soul and THEN BRINGS THE WORD OF
[2:47:06] SANCTIFICATION
[2:47:07] to the human spirit to keep bringing out
[2:47:11] a little bit of the dust
[2:47:14] that's on the inside.
[2:47:17] So he concentrates more on the human
[2:47:20] spirit
[2:47:22] where your daily activities
[2:47:26] are brood.
[2:47:29] Amen. And some of these ACTIVITIES
[2:47:32] ARE GOOD AND SOME OF them are bad. God
[2:47:38] must watch
[2:47:40] especially when you are that kind of of
[2:47:43] great cal.
[2:47:53] He cares so much
[2:47:56] when you he says ah which cow is that
[2:48:00] one.
[2:48:02] He says that one. [laughter]
[2:48:05] He says
[2:48:07] let me go around it. That's how God
[2:48:11] cares for the branch that brings forth
[2:48:14] fruit.
[2:48:18] There are some others
[2:48:20] they go for days without service.
[2:48:25] But when you go there without a service,
[2:48:30] he's going to look around
[2:48:32] and say, "Hey, where is Sister Har now?
[2:48:37] Because for years YOU HAVE BEEN VERY
[2:48:40] FAITHFUL, BUT HE STILL WANTS MORE FRUIT
[2:48:43] FROM YOU."
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:48:47] &gt;&gt; OH, praise the Lord. So there he does
[2:48:50] the work of checking through the
[2:48:53] activities.
[2:48:55] HE'S A DISCERNER OF THE THOUGHTS AND
[2:48:58] intents of the heart.
[2:49:01] AND NOW he works around you not by what
[2:49:05] you are doing
[2:49:07] but your intent.
[2:49:10] He doesn't want you even to error.
[2:49:13] is trying to watch. [snorts]
[2:49:16] What are your intentions
[2:49:19] in doing this? He's deleting certain
[2:49:22] THINGS
[2:49:24] THAT AFFECT YOUR CHARACTER
[2:49:27] much as you are still a fruitbearing
[2:49:30] branch.
[2:49:33] He deals with YOU IN FORM of intent.
[2:49:39] He comes and checks your human spirit.
[2:49:42] Amen. There are certain people when they
[2:49:46] do certain things maybe you will not
[2:49:49] care but when some other people they do
[2:49:53] certain things you get to get concerned
[2:49:57] because you are judging
[2:50:00] by the intent
[2:50:02] you are checking the human spirit. The
[2:50:06] purpose is to improve
[2:50:10] quality. Amen.
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; Verse 13, he says, "Neither is there any
[2:50:20] CREATURE
[2:50:22] &gt;&gt; THAT is not manifest in his sight,
[2:50:26] but all things are naked
[2:50:29] and open the eyes of him
[2:50:32] with whom we have to do."
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; We are played.
[2:50:40] We are open
[2:50:41] and sometimes the Holy Spirit knows how
[2:50:46] to talk directly
[2:50:48] to your intentions.
[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; If you are still a good branch bearing
[2:50:55] fruit,
[2:50:58] listen and change your way.
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we all come through the
[2:51:05] blood ping of Calvary
[2:51:09] as the body of Christ. BUT WE MUST come
[2:51:12] through this individual paging.
[2:51:17] And brother Brana related his gift of
[2:51:21] DISCERNMENT
[2:51:24] while pulling things from undercover
[2:51:28] to the people. Amen. as ping.
[2:51:36] &gt;&gt; HE HAD THE GIFT OF THE prophet
[2:51:39] and he ped the branch by discernment.
[2:51:46] But me, I am a preacher.
[2:51:50] I use the gift OF A PREACHER TO PUG the
[2:51:54] branch.
[2:51:59] There's no way you can ever get to your
[2:52:01] branch p
[2:52:05] when you don't have the confidence
[2:52:08] of the man who is the vine dresser
[2:52:15] who is going to preach her.
[2:52:21] Huh?
[2:52:23] That is a branch
[2:52:25] &gt;&gt; that does not bear fruit.
[2:52:31] Listen,
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; brother Brham
[2:52:35] connecting his gift to Py.
[2:52:40] He says in Jesus Christ the same
[2:52:43] yesterday,
[2:52:45] he says, "Let it be known to you that
[2:52:48] the God of heaven
[2:52:51] has made himself manifest
[2:52:54] in the form of Jesus Christ and has went
[2:52:58] into glory
[2:52:59] and come back into his church
[2:53:02] as set in his church." HE SAID, "YOU ARE
[2:53:07] the branches.
[2:53:10] I am the vine.
[2:53:13] You cannot bear no fruit
[2:53:17] lest I give you the life
[2:53:20] to bear it with.
[2:53:28] Did you hear that?
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; Then he say I am
[2:53:36] the vine.
[2:53:45] YOU CANNOT BEAR NO fruit le I give you
[2:53:50] the life to bear it with
[2:53:55] you. Ah,
[2:54:00] YOU WILL BEAR THE KIND OF fruit
[2:54:05] that I p you to.
[2:54:11] SO DON'T LOOK AT YOUR BROTHER.
[2:54:15] God has pugged him in a certain way
[2:54:19] to bring that fruit. HE WANTS TO BAG YOU
[2:54:22] A CERTAIN way
[2:54:25] to bring forth a certain form of fruit.
[2:54:29] He says, "And it happened to be
[2:54:34] this discernment happens
[2:54:38] TO BE PART THAT HE PES."
[2:54:46] AMEN. AMEN. SO GOD
[2:54:49] PED HIM THAT way
[2:54:52] to produce that gift.
[2:54:55] THAT AS YOU GET UNDER THE WORD,
[2:54:59] GOD IS PUGGING YOU A CERTAIN way
[2:55:02] to bring your fruit
[2:55:05] and that's why as church you don't have
[2:55:09] that habit
[2:55:11] and don't produce that habit.
[2:55:15] I I I even don't know what he was
[2:55:17] talking about.
[2:55:19] You are not me.
[2:55:22] God talks to individual branches.
[2:55:27] If you saw nothing,
[2:55:29] I saw everything.
[2:55:34] He does the pingging by the word
[2:55:38] and HE PES IN SUCH A WAY
[2:55:41] THAT YOU MAY BEAR A PARTICULAR FORM of
[2:55:44] fruit.
[2:55:47] So ping deals with natures.
[2:55:51] certain times that this paging deals
[2:55:54] with the nature
[2:55:57] that sometimes the environment
[2:56:01] has placed us into.
[2:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:06] &gt;&gt; Because once you are a doctor,
[2:56:09] I don't mean my brother here.
[2:56:12] There is a way God wants to make
[2:56:18] that crude thing sometimes.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:56:25] &gt;&gt; that your profession puts in you.
[2:56:29] He wants to pug that out
[2:56:32] that you may produce
[2:56:35] a believer's fruit,
[2:56:38] not a doctor's fruit.
[2:56:40] Our pastor is an engineer.
[2:56:43] But God pes
[2:56:46] amen that he may distill THAT ENGINEER
[2:56:50] THING.
[2:56:54] THAT THE gift of a pastor
[2:56:57] may be refined
[2:57:00] to BRING MORE FRUIT.
[2:57:02] HE WANTS to refine the character.
[2:57:05] Amen. OF THE BRANCH THAT BEARS FRUIT
[2:57:09] to a level where you become the adopted
[2:57:14] son of God
[2:57:17] in the NATURE OF GOD.
[2:57:20] AMEN. Where being a doctor.
[2:57:24] Amen. It's just a grafting.
[2:57:28] That's right.
[2:57:30] Amen. But the LIFE IS CHRIST HIMSELF.
[2:57:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You may be a mechanic,
[2:57:38] BUT THERE'S A GRAFTING. THE life is
[2:57:41] Christ.
[2:57:43] HALLELUJAH.
[2:57:45] HE SEPARATES
[2:57:47] THE SOUL AND SPIRIT AND THEN BEGINS TO
[2:57:51] GO IN THERE TO REFINE YOU that you may
[2:57:55] bring more fruit.
[2:57:59] Amen.
[2:58:00] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:58:02] &gt;&gt; He gets into our family.
[2:58:05] He begins to refine the families.
[2:58:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:58:10] &gt;&gt; You know, he he goes into the young.
[2:58:14] &gt;&gt; He looks at the lives of the children.
[2:58:17] &gt;&gt; You know, he's doing what he wants to
[2:58:19] do. He wants to bring more fruit.
[2:58:23] Hallelujah. The next thing we are going
[2:58:26] TO SEE
[2:58:28] IS THAT GOD
[2:58:30] is doing the refining
[2:58:33] in our families. And the next thing he
[2:58:37] says, we've got a a special
[2:58:41] a special soul
[2:58:43] by the family
[2:58:45] and then they come forward. You know,
[2:58:48] God is dealing with them in a certain
[2:58:51] way. Then you know they take time to
[2:58:56] worship God.
[2:59:00] That's right.
[2:59:01] God
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; is not condemning this branch.
[2:59:08] &gt;&gt; Why are you purging me?
[2:59:11] What wrong have I done?
[2:59:14] &gt;&gt; No, he's purging you because he loves
[2:59:18] more people.
[2:59:22] [laughter]
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:59:26] &gt;&gt; God is not condemning King Hezekiah.
[2:59:32] BUT HE SAYZEKIAH,
[2:59:35] YOU HAVE DONE A LOT, BUT I STILL NEED
[2:59:38] MORE FRUIT.
[2:59:40] SO HE SENDS PROPHET ISAIAH,
[2:59:42] GO AND TELL KING HEZEKIAH
[2:59:45] THAT HE'S going to die and let him put
[2:59:48] his family together.
[2:59:50] The man turns to the wall. HE BEGINS TO
[2:59:53] CRY. OH GOD, I have been A GOOD MAN. I
[2:59:58] have been bearing fruit. I mean, YES,
[3:00:02] GOD KNOWS THAT, BUT HE WANTS MORE FRUIT.
[3:00:07] Put your family right.
[3:00:12] HE WANTS TO SEE MORE FRUIT.
[3:00:15] HE DOESN'T ONLY WANT TO SEE THE FRUIT OF
[3:00:17] THE KING.
[3:00:20] He needs to see more fruit,
[3:00:23] the fruit of the father.
[3:00:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:00:29] &gt;&gt; God is not condemning you
[3:00:34] for the areas you've not brought fruit.
[3:00:39] He's only inviting you to a further
[3:00:41] growth.
[3:00:46] Amen. He pes fruit
[3:00:51] and he branches
[3:00:53] that bear fruit.
[3:00:56] Amen.
[3:00:57] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:00:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:01:00] &gt;&gt; So he pes fruit.
[3:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean he pes fruit branches.
[3:01:12] Because we are in the harvest time.
[3:01:17] He pes the doctors
[3:01:20] fil out that feeling.
[3:01:22] He pes the businessmen.
[3:01:26] to filter out the feeling of
[3:01:29] you know of I am here.
[3:01:33] He purges the teacher.
[3:01:36] &gt;&gt; You know the teachers
[3:01:39] &gt;&gt; they always know everything.
[3:01:43] If you tell him something
[3:01:46] the next minute he wants to teach you.
[3:01:50] &gt;&gt; You're not pastor. It's true. But Yeah,
[3:01:59] &gt;&gt; you ask sister Maria.
[3:02:01] &gt;&gt; Sister Maria, [laughter]
[3:02:03] &gt;&gt; where is brother David?
[3:02:08] &gt;&gt; He wants to pack them.
[3:02:11] &gt;&gt; Not because they are bad people,
[3:02:14] but he wants something better.
[3:02:19] Amen.
[3:02:20] &gt;&gt; When he comes to the ministers,
[3:02:23] &gt;&gt; he wants to pack them.
[3:02:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:02:28] &gt;&gt; Because this is the season of the
[3:02:31] harvest.
[3:02:34] This is the season of entering into
[3:02:36] possession.
[3:02:40] WHEN ISRAEL started out in Egypt,
[3:02:44] they needed ministers
[3:02:46] that were men of war
[3:02:50] because they were going to capture
[3:02:51] property. I mean, they were going to
[3:02:53] capture land.
[3:02:56] They were going to fight THROUGH
[3:02:59] THE PROMISE.
[3:03:01] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[3:03:02] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. BUT GOD
[3:03:06] WHEN THE TIME OF ENTERING CAME
[3:03:09] HE MADE SURE THAT ALL THE MEN OF WAR
[3:03:14] WERE GONE.
[3:03:20] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T COME IN HERE
[3:03:23] to fight in the promise.
[3:03:27] Amen. That's right. He purges everybody
[3:03:32] to bring more fruit.
[3:03:35] He needed the man of war.
[3:03:38] when the church was forming,
[3:03:41] cut out of I mean cutting out of
[3:03:43] denominations.
[3:03:46] But now we have our land
[3:03:50] and David has fought the last war
[3:03:56] against the Philistines.
[3:03:58] Amen. And just ahead of us is the
[3:04:02] kingdom of Solomon,
[3:04:05] the kingdom of peace.
[3:04:08] So he has to p
[3:04:11] the field of the ministers
[3:04:15] and filter out the attitude of war.
[3:04:23] We need the presence of mechised
[3:04:27] because he's the incoming king,
[3:04:31] THE KING OF PEACE,
[3:04:33] KING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[3:04:35] OH, HALLELUJAH.
[3:04:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY [screaming] I'VE NEVER FOUGHT
[3:04:40] wars here.
[3:04:45] &gt;&gt; I only preach
[3:04:48] the promises of the word because I know
[3:04:51] the season where we are.
[3:04:54] We are in the season
[3:04:56] of building the tabernacle
[3:05:00] because the master wants to come in HIS
[3:05:03] TAB.
[3:05:04] BUT LOOK AT DAVID. HE WAS ESTABLISHING a
[3:05:08] kingdom.
[3:05:09] He's a warrior. He's a man of war. When
[3:05:13] you wanted to put up the tabernacle,
[3:05:16] told him, "No, no, no, no, no. You were
[3:05:19] fighting my wars, but no, no, you cannot
[3:05:22] put up the tabernacle.
[3:05:30] God had to waste all the men of war.
[3:05:35] in the wilderness before God to get
[3:05:39] Israel into the possession.
[3:05:45] He's pinging
[3:05:47] these branches.
[3:05:50] They bring fruit. They are ministers.
[3:05:54] But he says,
[3:05:56] "Tone down. Turn down."
[3:06:02] You remember the anointing of Elijah?
[3:06:06] It went to Elisha
[3:06:09] &gt;&gt; uh and then down to uh Ju
[3:06:15] and the other one is who?
[3:06:19] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; And this sword,
[3:06:26] &gt;&gt; they were supposed to work together.
[3:06:29] that he that survives the sword of Ju,
[3:06:34] the sword of uh Elisha
[3:06:38] shall slay.
[3:06:42] So everybody was given a field
[3:06:47] to work in.
[3:06:49] Je was given a position
[3:06:53] to be king of Samaria.
[3:06:56] Amen. Aina
[3:06:59] &gt;&gt; and then also just eliminate
[3:07:02] the family of Ahab.
[3:07:08] &gt;&gt; But he became more zealous.
[3:07:22] And he was so beyond his call.
[3:07:28] And he said,
[3:07:29] "That woman Jezebel,
[3:07:33] she brought the worship of Ba.
[3:07:36] I'm going to eliminate all these B
[3:07:38] worippers."
[3:07:43] And then he pretended,
[3:07:45] &gt;&gt; I am now one of the Bal worshippers.
[3:07:50] And all of that,
[3:07:53] you come. And there was a revival in the
[3:07:56] land and everybody WENT
[3:08:01] back again.
[3:08:09] Are you together with me? And the people
[3:08:12] came and he says now
[3:08:17] I don't want anyone
[3:08:20] who doesn't worship
[3:08:23] to mix himself with us
[3:08:26] who just coming here
[3:08:29] simply because now the king
[3:08:32] is also woring by. So they say this one
[3:08:35] does it you go out you go out he says
[3:08:38] anymore he says anymore.
[3:08:41] Then he went out
[3:08:44] and he said,
[3:08:47] "Put men at the gate
[3:08:50] with swords.
[3:08:52] Kill all these men
[3:08:59] and if [laughter] no one escapes,
[3:09:03] you are going to pay for your for his
[3:09:05] life."
[3:09:07] So there was a sling the screams and the
[3:09:10] cries and
[3:09:13] you see he went beyond his call
[3:09:18] and God was unhappy with him.
[3:09:22] There is no any other from your line
[3:09:28] that will ever sit on that throne as
[3:09:32] king.
[3:09:37] Sometimes
[3:09:38] the ministers become very overzealous.
[3:09:48] But this is the time
[3:09:51] of King Maris,
[3:09:54] the king of peace.
[3:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:59] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[3:10:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:10:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:10:03] &gt;&gt; MEN OF WAR.
[3:10:06] COULD NOT ENTER THE KINGDOM.
[3:10:09] They couldn't enter this the the the
[3:10:12] promise.
[3:10:14] So God
[3:10:16] needs to filter out
[3:10:19] any little element
[3:10:23] in the man he allows
[3:10:26] to bear fruit.
[3:10:30] I'm trying to finish.
[3:10:33] So there is a growth
[3:10:36] the church has to take.
[3:10:44] We must be a kingdom of peace.
[3:10:50] Bring forth fruit.
[3:10:52] &gt;&gt; Be a brother. Be a sister. God is
[3:10:57] looking for more fruit.
[3:11:02] You've done a lot of things. Thank you
[3:11:05] so much. But he says, I want more.
[3:11:10] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[3:11:12] Easter Seal of Phoenix,
[3:11:15] &gt;&gt; the pro the prophet says. Now notice
[3:11:19] he's talking about the Holy Spirit is
[3:11:22] the unesting
[3:11:30] power
[3:11:32] of your resurrection.
[3:11:34] When you receive the Holy Spirit
[3:11:38] is then growing in you the potential of
[3:11:42] it.
[3:11:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:11:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:11:47] ALL THAT THE HOLY GHOST CAN do
[3:11:52] is already in you.
[3:11:56] HE SAYS WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY
[3:11:58] SPIRIT,
[3:12:00] IF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[3:12:03] BRINGS REST,
[3:12:05] the rest is in you.
[3:12:10] IF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[3:12:13] can conquer hate,
[3:12:17] then love is in you.
[3:12:21] &gt;&gt; So he comes now
[3:12:24] to deal with the HUMAN SPIRIT
[3:12:27] JUST TO IRON OUT
[3:12:30] THE FIELD THAT KIND OF BLOCK the
[3:12:34] potentials
[3:12:36] of the Holy Spirit to come to the
[3:12:39] surface.
[3:12:40] When he manages that, you will bear more
[3:12:44] fruit.
[3:12:46] Amen. So the POTENTIAL OF THE ALL THE
[3:12:49] HOLY SPIRIT INTENDS to build you into
[3:12:53] is already in you at your new birth.
[3:12:58] Amen. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND TIME
[3:13:01] AND TIME AGAIN,
[3:13:04] he will keep pugging you
[3:13:07] so that more of what the spirit can do
[3:13:12] will keep coming to you.
[3:13:15] He purges you because you ARE A GOOD
[3:13:18] BRANCH.
[3:13:19] HALLELUJAH. Tell your brother I'm a good
[3:13:22] branch.
[3:13:25] The devil doesn't want to hear that.
[3:13:28] He wants you to BELIEVE YOU'RE BACK.
[3:13:31] BUT THE MOMENT YOU discover that THE
[3:13:34] GOOD BRANCH, the devil has lost the
[3:13:37] battle.
[3:13:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:40] &gt;&gt; The prophet continues to say, "Amen."
[3:13:44] Notice
[3:13:46] you are now on your way growing
[3:13:50] to the full resurrection.
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So no tree
[3:13:58] just comes up overnight.
[3:14:01] It's got to grow.
[3:14:04] As we grow in the grace and knowledge of
[3:14:07] God,
[3:14:09] you are baptized into the Holy Spirit.
[3:14:12] Now as the Pentecostal church
[3:14:15] baptized into the Holy Spirit
[3:14:19] to growing,
[3:14:21] limbs has died.
[3:14:27] Hallelujah. Because he's ping.
[3:14:31] So now let nature graft certain things
[3:14:35] there.
[3:14:37] He plants them. Hallelujah. And when
[3:14:40] those suckers go then you bring more
[3:14:43] fruit. Hallelujah. YOU ARE A TREE. THIS
[3:14:48] FIRST TIME YOU ARE BRINGING the first
[3:14:50] mango.
[3:14:52] Then you could have 10 mangoes. Maybe
[3:14:56] that's a sign you can grow more.
[3:15:00] HALLELUJAH.
[3:15:02] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO GROW MORE BECAUSE THE LIFE
[3:15:06] THAT YOU CAN GROW FRUIT HAS ALREADY been
[3:15:09] vindicated.
[3:15:12] Amen. HALLELUJAH. THERE LIMBS THAT ARE
[3:15:14] CUT, CIGARETTES WERE CUT, ALCOHOL,
[3:15:20] THINGS WERE CUT,
[3:15:22] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS A SIGN. YOU CAN GROW MORE
[3:15:24] FRUIT.
[3:15:27] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[3:15:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:15:31] [sighs]
[3:15:31] &gt;&gt; They were spring. They were pruning them
[3:15:34] off.
[3:15:36] But the tree is still growing.
[3:15:39] is still going on because it's got to
[3:15:42] come to the resurrection.
[3:15:46] They are led by the spirit to quicken
[3:15:49] the word to you. You who is believers.
[3:15:55] Amen. The word keeps quickening.
[3:15:59] As you come to the first limb,
[3:16:02] second limb, third limb, it just keeps
[3:16:06] quickening.
[3:16:07] The spirit of God
