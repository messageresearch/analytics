[16:19] Jesus amen I GRE again in the name of
[16:22] the Lord Jesus
[16:24] Christ I request we go back to the
[16:27] scripture we read in the morning
[16:31] Jonah chapter
[16:33] 2 praise the name of our
[16:37] Lord Jonah
[16:40] 2 shall read
[16:45] verse praise the name of the
[16:52] Lord the Bible
[16:55] says I will sacrifice unto thee with
[16:59] voice of Thanksgiving I will repay that
[17:02] I have vought salvation is of the
[17:19] Lord
[17:22] seated I just want to continue with what
[17:25] we started in the
[17:27] morning praise the name of a lord I took
[17:30] almost a different direction in the
[17:36] morning praise the name of our Lord just
[17:39] something to build our
[17:41] Fai praise the name of our Lord just sng
[17:45] that
[17:46] song that he is Lord praise the name of
[17:50] our Lord now if he is
[17:53] Lord then what is difficult for him to
[17:56] do praise the name of our Lord we just
[17:59] need to see that we have confidence in
[18:01] the
[18:02] Lord praise the name of our Lord and
[18:05] then believe
[18:07] him now salvation is of the
[18:12] Lord praise the name of our Lord and
[18:14] many times when we talk about
[18:18] salvation we sometimes limit
[18:22] it know
[18:29] and then we put it at that
[18:31] time and then we don't bring it in our
[18:34] daily
[18:37] circumstances praise the name of our
[18:39] Lord maybe you are stuck in this kind of
[18:42] Str you have this kind of need you are
[18:45] traveled in this kind of things and we
[18:48] rarely bring those
[18:50] scriptures we don't always bring those
[18:54] scriptures to pass every
[18:57] day in daily
[19:00] living praise the name of our Lord we
[19:03] really do
[19:04] that we really do that but okay now I
[19:08] want us to
[19:10] move now you see here the Bible says
[19:14] that salvation is of the
[19:18] Lord it is only
[19:22] Christ that works it
[19:24] out now in the message the phian church
[19:27] age
[19:31] brother Bram
[19:35] says now works are
[19:39] fine but they don't save you they don't
[19:43] make you
[19:45] perfect it is Christ or
[19:49] perish and it is not even Christ and
[19:54] works it is Christ Alone
[19:58] this age began the years of
[20:04] arminianism that does not believe in
[20:06] Christ as the
[20:09] reality it does not sing of nothing but
[20:12] the
[20:19] blood but it SS
[20:22] of nothing but the blood and my own
[20:25] conduct
[20:30] now I believe in Good
[20:32] Conduct and if you are
[20:34] saved you will do
[20:37] righteously we have already gone over
[20:41] that but let me tell you now salvation
[20:45] is not
[20:50] Jesus it is Jesus
[20:52] alone salvation is of the
[20:56] Lord from start to finish
[21:00] all
[21:02] God let his life be in
[21:06] me let it be his blood that cleanses
[21:10] me let it be his spirit that FS
[21:14] me let it be his word in my
[21:18] heart and mouth let it be his stripes
[21:22] that H
[21:24] me be Jesus and Jesus alone
[21:29] not by works of
[21:32] righteous that I have done no sir Christ
[21:36] is my
[21:38] life amen so it is the Lord
[21:42] himself who starts out our
[21:46] Salvation from the very
[21:48] beginning to the end praise the name of
[21:52] our and just to bring it in the simplest
[21:54] it can
[21:56] be it is the
[22:00] who led you the first
[22:03] time when you interacted with the
[22:07] minister it's the Lord maybe you were on
[22:10] other
[22:11] things and then someh the Lord you in a
[22:14] certain
[22:16] place maybe it was a crusade or radio
[22:19] program or some book and then
[22:23] you unless you get saved then you start
[22:27] thinking this it was the Lord who led
[22:31] you to that
[22:33] point and it is the same Lord who
[22:37] appointed that
[22:39] minister to preach to you praise the
[22:43] name of our Lord now we just want to
[22:45] look at some scripture
[22:47] here you know
[22:50] Cornelius was
[22:53] praying until the angel came
[22:56] down and then when the angel came
[22:59] down the angel told
[23:01] Cornelius go call for
[23:05] Peter and now Peter where he
[23:08] was was also praying and
[23:11] fasting and then the Lord showed him you
[23:14] know different animals to be
[23:17] eaten and the voice was telling him slay
[23:20] and
[23:21] eat said I don't eat
[23:24] those the second time it came the third
[23:27] time went away and then Peter was
[23:31] wondering what is
[23:33] this and then at that same
[23:36] time people who were sent by
[23:40] Cornelius had reached where Peter
[23:43] reses praise the name of our Lord go to
[23:45] acts chap
[23:49] 10 and then we read
[23:53] in verse
[23:56] 17 now while Peter doubted in himself
[24:00] what this Vision which he had seen
[24:02] should mean behold men which were sent
[24:05] from Cornelius had made inquiry of
[24:08] Simon's house and stood before the gate
[24:12] and called and asked whether Simon Peter
[24:15] which was son named Peter was lodged
[24:17] there
[24:52] sought on this Vision the spirit said
[24:56] unto him behold three men seek
[24:58] arise therefore and get thee down go
[25:02] with them doubting nothing for I
[25:21] have now you see the spirit was telling
[25:26] Peter the Holy Spirit was telling
[25:29] Peter I'm the one who has sent these
[25:32] people go don't doubt anything and now
[25:36] when Peter reached the house of
[25:38] Cornelius he started wondering why did
[25:40] you call for me Cornelius told him the
[25:43] vision Peter started preaching to them
[25:46] the Lord Jesus
[25:48] Christ praise the name of our Lord now
[25:51] in Acts
[25:54] chapter8 praise the name of the Lord and
[25:57] then vers
[25:59] 26 and the angel of the Lord spoke unto
[26:02] Philip saying arise go toward the South
[26:05] unto the way that goes down from
[26:07] Jerusalem unto Gaz which is
[26:26] Desert and he AR and went and behold a
[26:29] man of Ethiopia an unar of great
[26:32] Authority Under The Queen Under cand
[26:35] queen of ethopians who had the charge of
[26:38] all her treasure and had come to
[26:40] Jerusalem for to worship
[27:03] and was returning and sitting in his
[27:05] Chariot read the
[27:17] prophet then the spirit said unto Philip
[27:20] go near and join thyself to The Chariot
[27:29] so you see it is always the Holy
[27:32] Spirit appointing the
[27:36] minister and it's the Holy Ghost using
[27:38] the
[27:39] minister to preach the word praise the
[27:43] name of our Lord so it is the spirit
[27:45] that ministers to
[27:48] you it's the spirit that preaches to you
[27:51] the word of
[27:53] God so now the Holy Spirit praise the
[27:57] name of our Lord like if we can now
[27:59] demonstrate it you are not at you are
[28:02] not at this
[28:04] wall and then the Holy Ghost is other
[28:08] world praise the name of our Lord that's
[28:11] not what it is but the Holy Ghost comes
[28:14] to where you
[28:16] are praise the name of our Lord and then
[28:19] starts taking you through all the
[28:22] way up to where he wants you to
[28:25] be praise the name of the Lord so the
[28:28] Holy Ghost ministers to you the word of
[28:32] God to bring you under
[28:36] conviction it is the holy spirit that
[28:38] convicts
[28:40] us let us go to John chapter
[28:43] 16 praise the name of the Lord John
[28:47] chapter 16 and
[28:49] verse
[28:52] 7 nevertheless I tell you truth it's
[28:55] expedient for you that I go away for if
[28:58] I go not away the comforter will not
[29:01] come unto you but if I depart I will
[29:03] send him unto
[29:23] you and when he is come he will reprove
[29:27] the world of sin
[29:28] and of righteousness and of
[29:37] judgment praise the name of our Lord so
[29:40] it's the Holy
[29:42] Ghost who brings
[29:45] conviction so when you are convicted in
[29:47] your heart it the holy spirit so then
[29:51] you can't say the Holy Ghost is far away
[29:53] from
[29:54] me it's the holy ghost that preaches to
[29:57] the word and when you hear the word it's
[30:00] the holy ghost that convicts
[30:02] you and now when you get
[30:04] convicted and you repent of your sins
[30:08] and you are baptized in the name of
[30:10] Jesus Christ it is the holy spirit that
[30:14] justifies
[30:16] you praise the name of our Lord so you
[30:18] see that it is this work of the
[30:22] lord it's the Lord who justifies you
[30:26] it's the Lord who sanctifies you
[30:29] it's the Lord who fills you with the
[30:30] holy spirit it's the Lord who raises you
[30:34] up it's the Lord who makes you grow
[30:38] up and it's the Lord who positionally
[30:41] places
[30:43] you that's the Holy Spirit the Holy
[30:46] Spirit preaches to you the Holy Spirit
[30:50] convicts you the Holy Spirit forgives
[30:53] your
[30:54] sins the holy spirit separates you from
[30:56] your evil
[31:00] nature
[31:02] sanctification then the same Holy Spirit
[31:05] after he has cleaned you
[31:08] himself he fills you himself so how is
[31:12] the holy spirit from
[31:14] you so the only thing that you need in
[31:17] this
[31:18] work is to be
[31:21] obedient to be willing and
[31:25] obedient that's how your full salvation
[31:28] can be
[31:29] worked you allow the Lord to take over
[31:32] your
[31:33] life and then he works in your life to
[31:37] bring you to his image to bring you to
[31:40] his St that's what salvation is all
[31:43] about is allow him to take over your
[31:47] life praise the name of our Lord let us
[31:50] go to
[31:53] E chapter 36
[31:58] and then we read from verse
[32:02] 24 the Bible
[32:05] says for I will take you from among the
[32:08] heaven and gather you out of all
[32:11] countries and I'll bring you into your
[32:24] own it is God who is saying
[32:29] I will take
[32:31] you from the
[32:33] heaven from
[32:35] unbelief and then take you to the place
[32:38] I want you to be
[32:41] in how does he do that then says then I
[32:44] will sprinkle clean water upon you verse
[32:53] 25 and you shall be
[32:56] clean from all all your
[32:59] filth and from all your
[33:03] Idols will I cleanse
[33:09] you praise the name of the Lord It's God
[33:12] himself saying I
[33:14] will
[33:16] I I will not
[33:19] yourself not your so much kind of works
[33:22] you want to

[37:23] it pleases
[37:24] you praise the name of the Lord so you
[37:27] can't say
[37:29] now I've taken 10 years without the Holy
[37:33] Spirit you don't know what you're
[37:34] looking
[37:36] for praise the name of our Lord you
[37:38] can't have look for the Holy Ghost the
[37:40] whole
[37:41] year you don't know what you're looking
[37:44] for praise the name of our Lord you
[37:46] don't
[37:49] know maybe you're looking for something
[37:52] different but is God himself saying I
[37:56] will do this
[37:58] I will do this I will do this I will do
[38:02] this you can imagine
[38:05] conar praise the name of our Lord the
[38:07] man was doing
[38:09] well praying giving for
[38:13] support praise the name of our Lord and
[38:16] then the angel came down and says your
[38:19] prayers have been
[38:21] heard then he says now what you need to
[38:25] do if you are going to do
[38:28] if you going to do better send for
[38:32] Peter and now when Peter is told please
[38:36] come he realized it's the Holy Ghost
[38:38] sending
[38:39] him but the Holy Ghost doesn't tell him
[38:42] everything but maybe along the road he
[38:45] hear the story of those men was
[38:47] moving and then he reaches cornelius's
[38:50] house why did you call
[38:53] for said you know I had this and this
[38:56] said okay I know God is a respect of no
[38:59] person but every person in every country
[39:03] where is respected know he does this he
[39:07] was talking then talked about Jesus how
[39:11] he died how he resurrected how we took
[39:14] our sins and then the Bible says while
[39:17] Peter yet spoke
[39:19] this and now you can imagine it was
[39:22] corus who was praying and
[39:24] fasting but when he heard that Peter is
[39:26] coming
[39:28] he called his neighbors and friends and
[39:30] fames come and we hear this is something
[39:33] God wants us to hear and now those
[39:35] people were all
[39:37] there praise the name of our Lord and
[39:40] then when they heard the word believed
[39:43] the word the Holy Ghost came and then
[39:46] you
[39:47] say and you say I've taken 10 years
[39:51] without the Holy
[39:53] Ghost praise the name of the lord it's
[39:56] not right
[39:58] there's something different you're
[39:59] looking
[40:00] for the Holy Spirit works out our
[40:05] Salvation from the very
[40:08] beginning to the very end that's what
[40:12] the Holy Ghost
[40:13] is praise the name of the Lord but we go
[40:16] and limit the Holy
[40:19] Spirit to what we want to see what we
[40:22] want to feel but it's the Holy
[40:26] Spirit brings conviction in your
[40:29] heart and it's the Holy Spirit when you
[40:33] are convicted and Lord forgive me you
[40:36] repent of your sins you go to the water
[40:39] baptism it's the holy spirit that
[40:43] justifies
[40:44] you praise the name of the Lord It's the
[40:46] holy spirit that sanctifies you it's the
[40:50] Holy Ghost himself that comes and BRS
[40:54] ins and here we are seeing what God is
[40:56] saying I will take you from the country
[40:58] of the
[41:00] heaven so you didn't say let me leave
[41:02] these sins and go
[41:05] and it was the work of
[41:08] God praise the name of our Lord that
[41:11] took you from there and put you
[41:13] somewhere
[41:14] else for his
[41:16] purpose praise the name of our Lord and
[41:19] then God changes your
[41:22] heart praise the name of the Lord I just
[41:24] want to read the quot here
[41:27] in the message what it it takes to make
[41:31] a
[41:34] Christian he says now I want you to
[41:36] listen for a few
[41:38] moments before closing I want you to
[41:42] notice one
[41:43] thing and watch closely
[41:47] now watch the order of the
[41:51] scripture I will take away the ston
[41:56] heart and give you a new
[41:59] heart now the heart is the dwelling
[42:03] place of the Holy
[42:06] Spirit and I will give you a new
[42:11] spirit I want you to watch the
[42:14] order now many people get mixed up
[42:20] there they think they got the Holy
[42:24] Ghost but they just get a new spirit
[42:28] watch I'll will give you a new
[42:32] heart and a new
[42:34] spirit and then I will put my
[42:39] spirit it says God had to give
[42:44] you a new
[42:46] spirit but that's a new spirit God give
[42:51] you so you could get along with the Holy
[42:55] Ghost
[42:59] with that old Spirit you
[43:02] had you couldn't get along with your
[43:06] neighbor you couldn't get along with
[43:11] yourself so you know you couldn't get
[43:14] along with
[43:16] God so God gives you a new
[43:20] spirit that's what he
[43:22] does so he gives you a new
[43:26] heart that you can be
[43:28] patient and you hear the word praise the
[43:32] name of the Lord and sometimes things
[43:34] being spoken are not pleasant to
[43:39] you but you are you are the the new
[43:42] heart becomes
[43:44] patient he puts the new
[43:47] spirit you know to get
[43:50] alone to get along with your
[43:53] neighbor to get along with the word to
[43:57] get along with God you're not going to
[44:00] quarrel with
[44:02] God you're not going you know to just
[44:04] say I don't like this so he gives you
[44:07] that spirit and then you can sit

[44:24] work upon your life
[44:28] praise the name of our Lord and as the
[44:30] Holy Ghost Works upon your
[44:32] life then the Holy Spirit
[44:35] himself comes and fills your
[44:37] heart praise the name of our Lord so you
[44:42] see that it's you to yield to
[44:45] God and many times under
[44:51] enthusiasm if you watch the
[44:54] life that it bears
[44:58] I hope I'm not
[44:59] hurting but I hope I'm
[45:03] uncovering see a lot of times you think
[45:08] that you would have the Holy
[45:10] Spirit oh you say I sng I spoke in Tong
[45:16] certainly being that close to
[45:20] it you might do all that but that isn't
[45:25] the holy spirit yet
[45:27] see the Holy Spirit Bears record of
[45:31] Jesus
[45:33] Christ now he
[45:36] taken what did he do he give you in your
[45:41] heart he give you in your spirit then he
[45:44] puts his
[45:46] Spirit his spirit in
[45:49] you you don't have to go
[45:52] around and pretend that you are a
[45:55] Christian man
[45:57] that new spirit brings the new life the
[46:02] holy spirit in your new
[46:06] spirit your new heart your new spirit
[46:11] and the Holy
[46:12] Spirit goes right in the center of your
[46:15] new
[46:18] spirit and your new spirit goes right in
[46:21] the center of your new
[46:24] heart but all these things they done by

[46:49] pick a cup that is
[46:53] justification but you can't use that cup
[46:55] in that condition
[46:58] because still dirty but you've already
[47:00] picked it that's how that's what happens
[47:03] to us when you accept Jesus as your
[47:06] personal
[47:07] savior he forgives all your past
[47:12] sins but in you there is still a
[47:17] nature to desire to do
[47:20] evil and now this is where
[47:22] sanctification starts from
[47:27] destroy that can
[47:29] nature that nature that desires to do
[47:32] evil praise the name of our Lord so he
[47:35] sanctifies you you know that's the time

[48:16] Lord he
[48:18] says the hidden life with
[48:21] Christ that's what the church needs
[48:24] today

[48:31] life you can't be D doubling along with
[48:36] the
[48:39] world and

[49:00] Church you are trying to belong to a
[49:03] better
[49:05] organization we better

[49:11] so that's not complying with
[49:15] Christianity
[49:16] Christianity is a sacrificed
[49:20] life hidden with
[49:23] God through Christ sealed by by the Holy
[49:28] Ghost that's what real Christian Life

[1:11:22] transformed you'll only pick the right
[1:11:24] thing
[1:11:27] praise the name of the Lord why because
[1:11:29] you are changed there is a life it's a
[1:11:33] pleasure praise the name of our Lord
[1:11:36] while the others are

[1:12:43] Sin if I go to church if I pay my dues
[1:12:48] if I do this do that if I quit this and
[1:12:53] stop that that is still on
[1:12:58] Mount it's
[1:13:00] you not

[1:16:12] the children of
[1:16:13] Israel they were in bondage 400
[1:16:18] years but it is God himself who came
[1:16:22] down praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:16:25] go in the book of
[1:16:27] Exodus chter 3 and verse
[1:16:33] 6 Exodus
[1:16:38] 3:6 moreover he said I am the god of thy
[1:16:42] father the god of Abraham the god of
[1:16:45] Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his
[1:16:48] face for he was afraid to look upon God
[1:17:03] and the Lord say I have sure seen the
[1:17:07] Affliction of my
[1:17:09] people which are in Egypt and have heard
[1:17:13] the Cry of by reason of their task
[1:17:18] Masters for I know their

[1:18:25] it's God who came down says I have come
[1:18:29] down to deliver
[1:18:32] them praise the name of our so it's God
[1:18:36] working out in our
[1:18:38] Salvation they were in bondage in Egypt
[1:18:41] then God said I've come
[1:18:43] down and then God identified
[1:18:47] Moses and said I'm sending you to bring
[1:18:52] these
[1:18:52] people praise the name of our
[1:18:55] so it was the grace of
[1:18:58] God that provided a
[1:19:02] deliverer it's
[1:19:04] Grace praise the name of our Lord
[1:19:07] salvation is of the
[1:19:09] Lord praise the name of our Lord you
[1:19:12] have to recognize it and accept it

[1:19:18] message
[1:19:20] atesh he says yes they had not lost
[1:19:24] their convence
[1:19:27] they had lost their
[1:19:31] freedom they were slaves but the
[1:19:33] Covenant still
[1:19:36] lasting and one day down there when they
[1:19:39] were groaning and crying under the task
[1:19:45] masters of the Egypt because they had
[1:19:48] become
[1:19:49] slaves I want you to notice this
[1:19:51] beautiful picture
[1:19:54] and this would be good for the
[1:19:58] legalists listen God never come down and
[1:20:03] say if you'll do certain things I'll do
[1:20:07] certain things God is
[1:20:10] Grace provided a
[1:20:13] savior Moses that's right not under any
[1:20:19] conditions was Moses
[1:20:21] brought but by The Sovereign Grace of

[1:20:29] savior but Grace provided a
[1:20:34] deliverer without any law without
[1:20:37] anything just solemn grace of God he
[1:20:41] sent down Moses to be a
[1:20:44] deliverer and the savior of the nation
[1:20:48] to bring them
[1:20:50] out praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:20:53] he said when when I think of that then I
[1:20:56] begin to
[1:20:58] remember that the same God that was with
[1:21:02] the Covenant people
[1:21:04] in is surely under all the
[1:21:09] strain he says under all the strength
[1:21:12] and difference that is in the church

[1:21:38] people without the efforts of
[1:21:42] theirs but he sent
[1:21:46] freely from Heaven to his Covenant
[1:21:50] people an act of
[1:21:52] Grace upon the servant of his
[1:21:56] promise he sent Moses and in the same
[1:21:59] crisis when the people is in

[1:22:07] and sickness and trouble today is just
[1:22:11] certain to send Jesus
