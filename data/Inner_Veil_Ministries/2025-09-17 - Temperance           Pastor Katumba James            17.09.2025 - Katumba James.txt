You have blessed us this evening father. May you wash us from all unrighteousness. Father you may help us Lordake of your divine nature that we all be changed and be transformed into the image of Jesus Christ. All our prayers Lord all the needs of your children heal the sick in our minist. Amen. I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us go to second Peter chapter one. Reading from verse 8, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Simon Peter, a servant and anost of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained life, precious faith with through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ." Sorry, Simon. Simon, grace and peace multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. According as his divine power, has given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue. Whereby are given unto us like nowadays they are they automatic things or electrical things. He sets maybe the speed of the thing or even the size of the the vessel is going to use the world, you know. Praise the name of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. He sets the conditions. He sets the circumstances. Praise the name of our Lord. He knows maybe this one I'm going to pass him through the flood. But it's all molding. He's molding the character. He's mold the nature or his own nature. Then he knows maybe this one I'm going to take him through the fire. This one I'm going to take him through sorrow. This one I'm going to take him to have no job. Sometimes the things we have, they affect the divine nature of God's development in our lives. When the Lord wants you to do this, something along the way, obstructing the work of God, God decides to put it away, his work can come to perfection. Praise the name of our Lord. God is sovereign. He knows where to touch. He knows what button to press. His desire in all these things will bring us into the image of Jesus Christ. So now the Bible says his divine power which he which he has given unto us. Praise the name of our Lord brings us into that life and godliness and the knowledge that we may be able to attain the glory and the virtue. So now you need to be under the hand of the potter. Let him work upon your life. Let him mold your life. You know just like an eagle when it is raising the small eagle it can steer the nest. Praise the name of the Lord. Where there were thorns. It removes you know it removes the feathers on top the soft landing and then removes everything. But the desire of the mother eagle is that the iglet can develop its nature that the igllet can develop its ability that the iglet can develop the mother ego skills. You know it's just like in life. You can't say me I have a skill when there's no training. Ah, when they give you a motorcycle, say I have the skill of driving riding a motorcycle and so you jump on a motorcycle. You don't know where the gear is. You don't know where the brake is. You don't know where the ignition is. You don't pedal is you don't even know how to balance. You are going to cause an accident. So you were taken through a training. So even the Holy Spirit works upon our lives to bring us into the image of Jesus Christ like the mother ego. Praise the name of our Lord. You may think that the ego has become so cruel. You know how can it start treating the little one? This is part of development of the nature. And then the Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter 5, &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord, the book of Hebrews chapter 5 and then verse 8. Let us start from verse six. and as he also in another place though at a priest forever after the order of Melisedc. Now you see Christ as the high priest, he came into the bodies that we are. And then the Bible says in verse seven, "For in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears, and to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard, in that he feared. [Music] Though he were a son, yet learned obedience by the things he suffered. The Bible says Christ our savior the things he went through. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord the character molding. There are things that God permits in our lives to develop his nature in us. But then one thing the Lord tells us, he gives us the guideline and that is the word of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he tells us that you need to have temperance. What does it mean? There are many situations that come in life. There are many things that come where you are exposed you know which are before you know they come at your place of work. Let us start with some things. Praise the name of our Lord. Right now, everybody is looking for money to go back to take children back to school. It's the pressure of the day. And you can have excuses not to come to church because your children have not yet gone back to school. But when you have the temperance of Jesus Christ, you will know that I have to control myself. Praise the name of the Lord. Like now if my work is riding a motorcycle, [Music] praise the name of the Lord. And you know for that business this is a peak hour. Many people are moving. Actually some people know that their money they get it in the morning and in the evening. But now if you have the consciousness of God, temperance will come forward and then you close your business and say let me be in the presence of the Lord because all these things are before us. Praise the name of our Lord. They all before us. But we are called upon to exercise temperance. And temperance is selfont control. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message the state of a perfect man brother Brham says in paragraph 221 temperance doesn't mean stop drinking in the world. That's one of the meaning of temperance. But he says no temperance doesn't mean alcoholic chure the Bible temperance the Holy Spirit temperance that is then he says the Holy Spirit temperance is what we are talking about that means how to Control your tongue. Not to be a tler. How to control your temper. Not to fly off every time anybody speaks across to you. You know it it is so broad. But it matters more about your reaction. After an action has come to you, somebody is criticizing you. Somebody's abusing you. Are you going to abuse back? Somebody has stepped on you. Are you going to kick them? Somebody is busy riding you. How are you going to handle such a condition? And you know the things of God, he takes us through the actions. Praise the name of our Lord. God does not assume but he takes you through it to prove what is inside. Praise the name of our Lord. And then he says and add these things add temperance to it. Temperance. How to answer in kindness. When wrath is spoke to you, somebody say, you bunch of holy rollers down there. Don't jump out and then roll your sleeves. Know that. But talk with godly love, temperance, kindness. Is that the way you want to be? When you are railed upon, you ra not back. Let Christ be your example. Like we can pick up a scripture here in first Peter chapter 2 and then verse 21. Chapter 2 verse 21 the Bible says for even here unto were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow his steps. Praise the name of our Lord. Christ gave us an example. And then the Bible says there was no girl found in him. There was no sin found in him. He never spoke anything evil. Now in verse 23, who when he was riled, rod not again. Now you look at Christ, the high priest, the creator of the heavens and the earth. They are calling him Belab. They are calling him all kinds of names. They are accusing him falsely. They are abusing him. The Bible says he never rolled back. &gt;&gt; Neither did he show them his authority. He never threatened them. Praise the name of our Lord. But then how many of us can do that? Then you can start telling somebody, &gt;&gt; you will see me today. That was not Christ bragging about his power, telling them that you are going to meet me at the white throne judgment and I'm going to throw you in the fire. He never did that kind of thing. How about us? &gt;&gt; Maybe in our communities where we live. Perhaps maybe you have leadership position or you have some kind of responsibility, maybe in your family, scaring another person, threatening another person. You know maybe at places of work you are a boss over some people and say I'm also going to show him I'm also going to show her that was not Christ. When they abused him when they criticized him he said father forgive them we need to have that same temperance of Jesus Christ. You know whereby you allow to take the pain. Praise the name of our Lord. And you are not seeking revenging. You are not seeking to do harm to somebody else, but you take the pain of what has been put on you. So the Bible says he never threatened but he committed himself to him that judges righteously. Praise the name of our Lord in Matthew 5 and verse 39. The Bible says Matthew 5:39, &gt;&gt; "Praise the name of our Lord." So he says, &gt;&gt; "But I say unto you that you should resist no evil, but soever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. Praise the name of our Lord. Of course, a smiting on a cheek is painful. But you can imagine turning and even this side. You don't smite them also. Temperance. Praise the name of our Lord. It's the nature of God himself that he comes and molds in us. Praise the name of our Lord and we desire to be like Jesus Christ. And this what brother Brandham was saying. Somebody talks bad about you, you don't talk bad about them. But with love, you forgive them, you bear with them. Praise the name of our Lord. The divine nature of God, but the Holy Spirit that comes and puts that in you. You know, somebody has talked all evil about you. Then you say also also release the gazette. No, it's not like that. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, brother Brandham teaches us that eternal life is living for others. You intercede for that person doing such things. Father forgive them because they don't know what they are doing. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message still the state of a perfect man paragraph 224 he says when they said if thou be the son of God turn these stones into bread. He could have done it and show he was God. But he had temperance. When they called him Belzeba, he said, "I'll forgive you for it." That's right. They pulled handfuls of his beard out of his face and spit in his face. And they said, "Come down of the cross." He said, "Father, forgive them. They don't even know what they are doing." Temperance. Praise the name of Jesus. We need it in our lives. At our homes, at our places of work, where we study from, wherever we spend our lives, we need to have the temperance of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. And then he says, when he had the gift, he knowed all things. For in him was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Seen him perform miracles by telling people what was wrong with them. And so forth like that. They put a rug around his head like that, around his eyes and hit him on the head with a stick and said, "Prophesy. Tell us who hit you. We will believe you." See, he had temperance. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he said, "Now, if you got it like that, Praise the name of our Lord. You know there is something the Lord has done in your life. Change that God has done in your life. Then he says if you still blow up and fast and stew and carry on you ain't got no. Praise the name of the Lord. Add that because it won't add. It won't vulcanize. You can't take a piece of rubber, you know, and vulcanize it to a piece of iron. Praise the name of our Lord. There has to be something that is of likeness. Praise the name of our Lord. You can't add temper to the divine nature of God. You can't add you know boastfulness or regret you know to the divine nature of God that is outside completely. So we need to find out where are we in our lives. Praise the name of the Lord. Then he says it just won't work. &gt;&gt; No, it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is. And when your faith and your temperance becomes the same kind of holy ghost temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him. You are added to it. When your virtue is like his virtue then it will add to it. When your knowledge is like his knowledge, I will come to do thy will. Oh God, see with the father's word, he defeated every devil. Heaven and earth will pass away, but the word will not. When you got that kind of knowledge, It will vulcanize with your faith. When you got the right kind of temperance like a heart, it will vulcanize. If you haven't just a man, a man made halfway sed up belief. Oh, I ought to slap him down, but maybe I better not. They might put my name in the paper about it. And that ain't the kind of temperance we talking about. Now, you know, there are some of these natural things people can try to figure out. You know, he can try to pretend to be patient. He can try to be good. But it is manmade. Even temperance. But for him is looking at the other side of the coin. If I react like that, people will mistaken me. But when he is alone, he will do that because there's nobody who's going to see him. Then he says that is not what it is. But this is something that should come from you because it's a nature that God has molded in you. You're not looking at maybe the publicist of your name. Praise the name of our Lord. But you know you are looking at obeying the word of God. Praise the name of our Lord. And you know it also works on the other side. Praise the name of the Lord. You know when the politicians are giving out money, they want the cameras to look at them. There is a minister who was giving out a check and then the camera man was not ready. and they get big dummy checks. Then they put their 50 million shillings on the bank of Uganda and they want the cameraman to be looking at them. So there's a minister who was giving out the check and the cameraman didn't take it. Have you taken it? Not yet. So you bring it back. until now he said are you ready for them they want the left hand to know what the right hand has has given but that's not of Christ said when the right hand gives the left hand not know about it you don't start blowing it up let them know like a soul when he had victory he wanted everybody to know about it. Praise the name of our Lord. That is not of Christ. It's not for show up you know it's not for kind of publicity you know like politicians now they know how to pretend. Now he will go and get some good cameramen. Then he goes and he sits with people eating a show off you know but that's not the way of the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. That's not the way of the divine nature of God. Praise the name of our Lord. So then he says that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about. You don't try to add that it won't work. But when you can really with the sweetness from your heart, forgive every man, hold your peace, let it be gone. See, it will vulcanize. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to have the temperance of Jesus Christ. Now we see in one of the scriptures here in Genesis chapter 34. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; Let us go and read that story. Genesis chapter 34. I remember some weeks ago we're talking about seeing the daughters of the land. When dinner the daughter of Jacob went out to see the daughters of the land and then she defiled her. So now the Bible says when Jacob heard in Genesis 34:5 When Jacob heard that they had defiled his daughter Dina Genesis 34:5 Okay. Now his sons were with him were with his cattle in the field. And Jacob held his peace until they were come. of our Lord. The Bible says he held his peace temperance. He never went immediately and reacted over that situation. And many times we are we are kind of subjected to different situations in life. Praise the name of our Lord. Something happens which you never expected. Do you react to that kind of thing or you just become furious and make a decision immediately or you want to immediately follow the line and say this thing has to I have to destroy this kind of person. The Bible says Jacob held his peace &gt;&gt; until even and his father they came and started talking to him. Praise the name of our Lord. But then you see that the sons of Jacob, they never had any temperance of anything. But they tried to make a way how to treat these people. Tell them if you can circumcise yourself and then you know you can be part of us. We can all circumcise. And when all the men of the city circumcised and they knew that their wounds were now painful. Simeon Simeon &gt;&gt; with his brother went and killed all the male in the city. They never had any form of temperance. Revenge, kill everybody. Yet it was only one person responsible. They just destroyed all the male in the city. And so sometimes we can be we can get ourself into those kind of situations. If you don't have temperance, you may end up speaking something which is not right unadvisably. Praise the name of our Lord. You just do it immediately like Elisha when the children were cursing him. You know they were ridiculing him. You baldheaded maned man had temperance on that. He just cast them until all those children were killed. So now Christ desires us to have temperance in our lives. One day the Lord Jesus was going to a city to preach and then they never received them. So John and James told Jesus, let us call fire like Elijah from heaven. Now for them they were saying we need to follow this Old Testament example here. Now But Jesus told them, you don't know what kind of spirit is on you. He had temperance. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And we also need to exercise temperance to one another. Jesus told them, "The son of man never came to destroy lives. But to save lives, praise the name of we need to have the divine nature of Jesus Christ. Exercising temperance at your place of work. Exercising temperance at your home. Exercising temperance to your neighbor or the people that we interact with anywhere. We need to have temperance for one another. Praise the name of our Lord. Not showing how powerful you are. Not showing how influential you are. Not showing how privileged you are. But the humility of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to exercise temperance. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message the stage of a perfect man. Praise the name of our Lord. And then paragraph 2 230 &gt;&gt; he says and then it is put right before you and then you walk away. Well, we will get to that just a few minutes. But when you fly loose, want to jump at every conclusion, that is not it. You haven't got Bible temperance. When you do that, how to answer back, then if you got all this, you can add this to your faith. Temperance, how to handle situations as they come, how you handle challenges as they come. You already pressured by something. But then how do you relate? How do you handle that? Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message, Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Brother Brenham says a prisoner of Jesus Christ for a prisoner. See when God gets you to be his prisoner then you can't do nothing but what the spirit says do. Praise the name of our lord. You know you are developed in nature. I can do nothing of my own but what I see the father doing you'll find it is something that is automatic. It's not something that you think about the options. Ah maybe this one is bad, this one is okay. But it is a nature that is in you. You know the way it is that when a fly is coming to your eyes then your eyes automatically blinks. So even the nature of Christ, it just comes out selfcontrol. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Like Job, &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord. He exercised temperance when he had bad news in one day of all the things that befell him in Job chapter one. The children have died. The animals have been stolen. These have been done. This have been done. He exercised self-control. Praise the name of our Lord. And then he just woripped. Naked I came into the world. Naked will I go. Praise the name of our Lord. He exercised temperance. How about us? Praise the name of our Lord. Maybe you're going through hardrations at home or hardrations at your place of work. Are you going to start cursing God or are you going to blame the time you've spent in church temperance, you know, you learn how to control yourself. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Job learned that even Paul here, brother Brandham says he was a prisoner he could not do anything. Paul with all the his great intellect. He was taught by Gile to be a great priest or a rabbi someday. He had high ambitions. He was intellectual, a great man, great authority, great man in the nation. But he had to sacrifice every bit of it. see to become part of the word to express Jesus Christ. There was a trade off to do. Praise the name of our Lord, empty himself in order to receive. Praise the name of our Lord. And that's the same thing the Lord desires of us. Praise the name of our Lord. That's why the Bible says, "If you're a man of high estate, humble yourself down to the least of the people like our Lord Jesus Christ. He condescended himself to the least of the people to the lowest of the place going to hell until even the least person in work you know the the flank the one who washes the feet he found I can't do the job on this man here he went to the list of the places Praise the name of our Lord. And then the Bible, brother Brandham says, &gt;&gt; but he had to sacrifice every bit of it to become part of the word to express Jesus Christ. He knowed what it was. Praise the name of the Lord. He had a notion to go over some place. Some brethren had called him but he was forbidden by the spirit to do his own will. If people have spiritual can pick that up. He was forbidden to do his own will. The spirit forbide him. He was a prisoner to Christ. Then this little fortune teller one day one day who he knowed Paul know he had power to cast that devil out but he could not only do it as God willed it day after day she followed him, cried out after him. See the temperance, it is something bad they are doing to you. But he was patient until it was the will of God to cast out that evil spirit, crying after him. But wanted the spirit give him permission. [Music] Then he rebuked her. The spirit that was in her, he knowed what it was to be a prisoner. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to exercise the temperance of God at our places of work, at our schools, even at our home and wherever we are. Praise the name of our Lord. You deny your rights. You are not there to use your power all the time. All the authority you have, all the privileges you have. Praise the name of our Lord. But you want to take the way of the Lord is despised. Learning selfont control. Praise the name of our Lord. And you know temperance can cover so many things. Even our very lifestyle. How we behave ourselves, how we conduct ourselves. Are you there to show off all the time? Praise the name of the Lord. Are you there to do things in the extremes? No. We need to exercise the temperance. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. The Lord Jesus Christ coming down to the lower level. Praise the name of our Lord. Not showing who you are. Not you know being up everywhere. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to have that temperance. We see that Jacob exercised self-control. He humbled himself. He handled things calmly. Praise the name of our Lord. And in life, we are required to do the same thing. He just react over everything. But you take time. Praise the name of our Lord. How you handle things how you relate things. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to have the temperance of Jesus Christ. May God bless you. Amen. [Applause] Amen. Let us stand up and sing a song and we can pray to the Lord. Must Jesus bear the cross alone. Praise the name of our Lord. Must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free. No, there is a cross for everyone. And there is a cross for me. The cause cross I'll bear till death shall set me free. Then go home my crown to wear for there is a crown for me upon the cream.
