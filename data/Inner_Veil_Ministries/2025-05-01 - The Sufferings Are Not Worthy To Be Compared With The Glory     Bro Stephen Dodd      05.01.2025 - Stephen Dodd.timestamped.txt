[18:20] uh we trust the Lord is
[18:24] here and is going to use every
[18:29] gift or to be used
[18:33] today to bless you. So, what you need to
[18:37] do this
[18:39] morning, just enter into that
[18:43] presence and tell the Lord, "I'm
[18:46] here. I want to hear from
[18:49] you. Bless my
[18:52] soul. Give me what I need to know
[18:55] now. Hide it in my
[18:57] soul. Water it. Bring
[19:01] fruit." Amen. Amen. That's what we need
[19:04] to do this
[19:05] morning. Just relax in the
[19:08] presence and allow the Lord to bless
[19:12] you. So today
[19:15] um we've got just two three things to
[19:19] take out of the
[19:22] way so that uh brother
[19:27] Steven comes to speak to
[19:30] us. Amen. Amen.
[19:36] Brother Steven
[19:38] Doden Dod is son to brother Tim
[19:48] Dod. It's a great pleasure having a
[19:53] son who has been brought to your
[19:55] adoption.
[19:58] Amen.
[20:00] Praise the Lord.
[20:02] He can speak like the
[20:05] father. He has the mind of the
[20:08] father. His signature is as good as the
[20:11] father's
[20:14] signature. Amen. The things we learned
[20:17] from the natural
[20:20] adoption and looking at your son walking
[20:23] into the
[20:25] ministry is a real blessing. Amen. Amen.
[20:29] Will you also help your children?
[20:32] Yes, it's a pleasure seeing your child
[20:35] stand behind the holy
[20:39] desk and challenge the spirit.
[20:43] Amen.
[20:44] Praise the Lord. Uh so, brother George
[20:50] Emoj has got
[20:53] uh his grandchildren once dedicated this
[20:59] morning. If you can have them coming, it
[21:02] will be a
[21:06] blessing. Bring them
[21:09] in.
[21:14] Bring in from the
[21:19] field. Bring them.
[21:27] Bring
[21:30] bring little ones to
[21:37] Jesus. Praise the Lord.
[21:40] All the
[21:46] four. Okay.
[21:49] [Music]
[21:50] So they all have to be dedicated to the
[21:53] Lord
[21:57] today.
[21:59] Okay. Praise the Lord.
[22:02] So brother George
[22:06] has
[22:07] been here with
[22:10] us I think from 1989
[22:14] or Amen. Amen. So he's trying
[22:18] the best he
[22:22] can to take the token to his
[22:26] children and to his
[22:29] grandchildren. The children could have
[22:32] strayed, but he couldn't let the
[22:35] grandchildren go.
[22:38] He tries the best he
[22:40] can to bring them to
[22:43] church and be able to hear the
[22:47] word. So I want us to remember one
[22:52] thing that you know
[22:56] children were not
[22:59] baptized. They were only dedicated to
[23:03] God that God's hand can be with them.
[23:08] walk with them, protect them, and when
[23:12] they come to the age of
[23:16] responsibility to know what the gospel
[23:19] means, they love to
[23:22] repent, be
[23:24] baptized in that special for the baptism
[23:27] of the Holy
[23:29] Spirit, and then walk a
[23:32] walk that testifies of the goodness of
[23:35] Jesus Christ.
[23:37] So we want wherever we
[23:40] are just to bow our
[23:42] heads. I'm going to pray for these
[23:45] children that the Lord may have a hold
[23:48] of their
[23:50] lives. Precious heavenly
[23:53] father, these four little
[23:56] children have been brought to
[23:59] you and father their grandfather is
[24:03] dedicating them.
[24:06] that father you may get a hold of
[24:09] them like Samuel was
[24:12] dedicated. You got a hold of
[24:15] him. You anointed him. You positioned
[24:19] him in the body and you used him.
[24:23] Heavenly Father, that's the same prayer
[24:26] we have here this
[24:27] morning that your great
[24:30] presence may overshadow these children.
[24:34] Protect them, Lord, from the
[24:37] spirit that always try to
[24:41] capture the hearts of the young
[24:43] people to an early age. Father, I pray
[24:47] that you may protect
[24:49] them, give them the grace they need.
[24:51] Lord, and as they continue walking in
[24:55] this
[24:55] life, Father, as they hear the word, I
[24:59] pray that the word may get to the point.
[25:03] heavenly father who can arrest them and
[25:08] bring them to you as
[25:11] tokens of Calvary. I pray heavenly
[25:14] father that the blood of Jesus may be
[25:18] applied upon them in a special way. I
[25:22] pray that you may protect them, Father,
[25:26] even from any kind of wild
[25:30] spirit that moves among the young
[25:34] people, Lord, they may stand out with a
[25:38] little fear of God they
[25:40] have that they may resist all
[25:43] evil and dedicate them to you that you
[25:47] may walk with them until you bring them
[25:49] to the altar. give their lives to you in
[25:54] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[25:58] you. God bless you. God bless you. God
[26:02] bless you. Amen. God bless you. Um so I
[26:08] need the young people to come
[26:12] forward to do your song.
[26:16] Amen. Amen. And
[26:21] then
[26:25] thereafter we shall be able to change
[26:28] the order of
[26:33] service from
[26:35] us to our visiting
[26:38] brothers. Amen. Amen. and uh brother
[26:42] Judah
[26:44] will also give a song.
[26:55] So I'll give the
[26:59] opportunity to his
[27:01] father to invite him. So, we've got
[27:05] father
[27:07] and then we've had the
[27:12] son and
[27:14] uh the
[27:22] grandson they've walked our
[27:26] path and I want to tell you brother
[27:29] Judah
[27:31] that the name No,
[27:34] he's very respected here.

[37:29] live. This is my
[37:33] prayer. This is my plea.
[37:37] Let the
[37:38] worshipers
[37:41] [Music]
[37:43] arise. Oh, let the sons and the
[37:46] daughters
[37:48] [Music]
[37:52] sing. I surrendering my
[37:59] all. I surrender to the king.
[38:10] Father, I hear it growing
[38:13] louder. Song of the redeemed. As the
[38:18] saints of every
[38:21] nation, our awakening to sing. From our
[38:26] hearts there comes an
[38:28] anthem. Oh, hear the heavens ring. This
[38:32] is our
[38:35] song. Song to our king. Let the
[38:40] worippers
[38:43] arise. Oh, let them
[38:45] arise. Let the sons and daughters
[38:52] sing. Oh, I'm surrendering my all.
[39:00] my all I surrender to the
[39:09] king and
[39:11] father I see the lamb
[39:14] rising with the book of
[39:18] history he has opened up the
[39:22] seeds and now the bride can see it's a
[39:28] brand new revelation
[39:30] ation. The shout of the seven seal. He
[39:34] is the
[39:37] lamb. He is our
[39:40] king. Let the worippers
[39:45] arise. Oh, let them
[39:47] arise. Let the sons and daughters
[39:52] sing. Oh yes, Lord. I'm surrendering my
[39:59] [Music]
[40:00] all. My
[40:03] all. I surrender to the
[40:10] [Music]
[40:11] king. And father, I see the bride
[40:17] adorning in the word of her king. She is
[40:22] rising now in
[40:25] power. And she's
[40:27] anointed to see for the seals they have
[40:32] been open. It's the last great mystery.
[40:37] This is our
[40:39] song. Song of the redeemed.
[40:43] [Music]
[40:45] Father, I see your bride
[40:48] rejoicing in the song of victory. Amen.
[40:53] Every chain of death is
[40:56] broken. And we have been set free.
[41:01] Satan's kingdom is
[41:04] defeated. And now we worship free praise
[41:09] to our Lord.
[41:12] He's the king of
[41:14] kings. Let the worippers
[41:18] arise. Oh yes. Let them
[41:22] arise. Let the sons and the daughters
[41:27] sing. Oh yes. I'm surrendering my
[41:34] all. I surrender all.
[41:38] I'm surrender to the
[41:44] king. Oh, let the worippers
[41:53] arise. Oh, let the sons and the
[41:56] daughters
[41:57] [Music]
[41:59] sing. Yes, Lord. I'm surrendering my
[42:04] all.
[42:07] Surrender all. I surrender to the king.
[42:13] [Music]
[42:21] [Applause]
[42:27] Amen. Have you surrendered to your king?
[42:31] Praise the Lord.
[42:33] Why don't we stand and take our Bibles
[42:35] together?
[42:38] We're going to turn to the book of
[42:40] second Peter chapter 1.
[42:50] Just before we read, why don't we bow
[42:53] our heads in prayer?
[42:58] Our precious heavenly father,
[43:02] Lord, we thank you for another
[43:04] opportunity today.
[43:07] to gather with saints of like precious
[43:12] faith with sons and daughters of the
[43:15] king.
[43:18] Lord, we just want to make the most of
[43:20] this opportunity,
[43:24] Lord. Therefore, we want to welcome you.
[43:28] We want to give you the preeminence,
[43:30] Lord.
[43:33] But Lord, we did not come here to hear a
[43:36] man. For we are not feeding upon a
[43:40] man. We are feeding upon the unfailing
[43:44] body word of the son of
[43:48] man. Lord, you have opened your word to
[43:50] us in this last
[43:53] days. But Lord, it takes you to reveal
[43:56] it to our
[43:59] hearts. And we just welcome you to
[44:02] come as you promised Lord that you would
[44:05] be
[44:07] here wherever two or three are gathered
[44:09] in your
[44:11] name. You said there I am in the midst
[44:13] of
[44:14] them. We just give you the preeminence
[44:17] today
[44:18] Lord. We ask you bless the reading of
[44:20] the
[44:22] word. Bless the hearing of
[44:25] it. May our hearts be open to you this
[44:28] morning.
[44:30] In the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[44:34] Amen. Amen.
[44:36] Amen. Let's read from verse 5 of second
[44:40] Peter chapter
[44:43] 1. It says, "Besides this, giving all
[44:46] diligence, add to your faith virtue and
[44:49] to virtue knowledge.
[45:08] into and to knowledge temperance and to
[45:10] temperance patience and to patience
[45:21] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[45:24] kindness into brotherly kindness,
[45:33] charity. For if these things be in you
[45:36] and abound, they make you that you shall
[45:39] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[45:42] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[46:02] Let's turn also to Romans chapter 8.
[46:07] And we'll read there in verse 17.
[46:18] And if children then hes of God and
[46:22] joint hes with Christ, if so be that we
[46:25] suffer with him, that we may be also
[46:28] glorified
[46:42] together For I reckon that the
[46:44] sufferings of this present time are not
[46:48] worthy to be compared with the glory
[46:51] that shall be revealed in us.
[47:10] Let's read one more scripture in
[47:12] Colossians chapter 1 and we'll just read
[47:15] verse 27.
[47:23] to whom God would make known what is the
[47:26] riches of the glory of this mystery
[47:29] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[47:32] you the hope of glory
[47:36] Colossians 1 verse Colossians 1 verse 27
[47:55] Amen. May God add his blessing to the
[47:56] word. You could have your
[47:59] seats. We want to speak today on the
[48:02] suffering is not worthy to be compared
[48:05] with the glory.
[48:13] So the Bible says there's
[48:17] sufferings and there's glory.
[48:20] But the sufferings that we
[48:24] face, they're not worthy to be compared
[48:27] with the glory.
[48:31] The glory that shall be revealed in
[48:35] us through what God has done for us.
[48:41] is worth more than all of the sufferings
[48:44] that we could go
[48:51] through. The sufferings are not worthy
[48:54] to be compared to
[48:57] it. They're they're not even in the
[49:00] same the same
[49:05] classification. They're so far apart.
[49:10] So God has a
[49:13] purpose and God has a plan for what he
[49:16] is
[49:18] doing. He said in Jeremiah that he would
[49:21] give us unexpected
[49:25] end. He didn't tell Jeremiah what that
[49:28] end would
[49:31] be. The mysteries were not yet
[49:35] revealed. But he said, "Be patient.
[49:39] because there is an expected
[49:42] end. There is a purpose to all that
[49:45] you're going
[49:47] through. There is a purpose to this
[49:52] molding. There there's a purpose to this
[49:57] suffering. One day it will be
[50:00] revealed. But in the days of Jeremiah it
[50:03] was not
[50:05] revealed. But he told his
[50:09] people, his
[50:11] children, there is an expected
[50:17] end right from the
[50:19] beginning from before the foundation of
[50:22] the
[50:23] world. The mystery was hidden in
[50:27] God. God didn't reveal his entire
[50:32] purpose, but he hid it within himself.
[50:37] that it might be revealed in its
[50:40] time, in its
[50:43] season. Because the fullness of the
[50:45] mystery of God,
[50:49] would bring forth the
[50:51] rapture, would bring forth the body
[50:55] change, would bring forth the fullness
[50:57] of our
[50:59] inheritance. So God could not reveal it
[51:02] before its time.
[51:06] Because faith comes by
[51:09] hearing, hearing the word of
[51:12] God. So if God would give the fullness
[51:15] of his
[51:17] word at the
[51:20] beginning, it would bring faith for a
[51:23] rapture. But God held it back.
[51:28] He hid it.
[51:31] It it says that uh u they they received
[51:35] not the promise.
[51:38] They obtained the elders obtained a good
[51:40] report through
[51:46] faith. But yet they receive not the
[51:49] promise, the expected
[51:52] end city whose builder and maker is God.
[51:58] They received not the
[52:00] promise that they without us would not
[52:04] be made
[52:08] perfect. Because if they had received
[52:10] the promise
[52:12] in, they would have been
[52:15] perfected and the plan of God would have
[52:19] finished. But all of creation is
[52:21] groaning.
[52:25] Not waiting for the fullness of God's
[52:28] plan to be
[52:31] revealed, but it's waiting for the
[52:33] manifestation of the sons of God.
[52:41] So God could not bring creation back
[52:43] into its original
[52:47] estate until every son of God had been
[52:53] manifested till every attribute of God
[52:56] had been
[52:59] revealed. It had to wait for this
[53:03] day because there was attributes of God
[53:06] in this day that needed to be revealed.
[53:13] So he says if children then
[53:18] hes of
[53:20] God and joint airs with
[53:24] Christ if we suffer with him
[53:29] that we may also be glorified
[53:33] together. So potentially all of the
[53:36] glory is there
[53:40] but it is revealed through suffering.
[53:47] It's brought to its full potentials
[53:50] through
[53:54] suffering the glory that shall be
[53:59] revealed. If we hold
[54:02] steady, we stay
[54:05] steadfast walking in what God reveals to
[54:09] us day by day.
[54:12] There is a glory which shall be
[54:17] revealed. Not around us,
[54:21] not something else,
[54:23] but in us.
[54:26] The mystery among the Gentiles,
[54:30] which is Christ in you,
[54:34] not Christ in God,
[54:38] Christ in you,
[54:40] the hope of glory.
[54:44] So the Holy Spirit within us
[54:48] gives us hope of glory,
[54:52] hope of of um hope of reaching our full
[54:56] potentials in
[55:02] Christ. Will Brandham says in the
[55:04] stature of a perfect
[55:08] man says now Peter is saying here
[55:12] how that we must be partakers of his
[55:15] divine
[55:19] nature. Now each one of us is trying to
[55:22] grow into the stature of
[55:28] God. So there's a
[55:31] growing we must grow into the stature of
[55:36] God. The full potentials is within us.
[55:41] but we must grow into
[55:46] it all that God has for
[55:51] us. So Peter says, "So we need to give
[55:58] diligence." Diligence means
[56:03] quickly. Don't waste any
[56:07] time with haste.
[56:13] So we need to give
[56:16] diligence. If we have accepted the
[56:19] molding of God in our
[56:22] lives, we must give diligence to every
[56:26] word of
[56:29] God. The word from yesterday is not
[56:32] enough.
[56:35] We don't need to worry about the word
[56:37] for tomorrow.
[56:42] But we need to give diligence to the
[56:44] word that God has revealed to us
[56:50] today. We're all children growing in
[56:54] Christ. We're all at different
[56:59] stages. Some have just received the new
[57:02] birth. Some have been growing in Christ
[57:05] for many years.
[57:08] But we are all growing together
[57:12] until we all come into the fullness.
[57:22] Jude in Jude 1 and verse
[57:25] three. Jude come again. Jude,
[57:35] he says, "Beloved, when I gave all
[57:37] diligence to write unto you of the
[57:39] common salvation, it was needful for me
[57:42] to write unto you and exhort you that
[57:46] you should earnestly contend for the
[57:49] faith which was once delivered unto the
[57:52] saints.
[58:13] So all these
[58:16] brothers, brother Jude,
[58:19] brother Peter, Peter, we'll read about
[58:22] brother Paul.
[58:24] They're all admonishing
[58:26] us, saying, "Give
[58:29] diligence. Earnestly contend for it."
[58:34] They're not writing to the unbeliever,
[58:37] but they're writing to the
[58:40] churches to as as the word
[58:43] says to provoke one
[58:47] another to love and to good works.
[58:52] Why are they admonishing us to do
[58:56] so? In verse
[58:59] four, Jude says, "Because there's
[59:01] certain men crept in
[59:06] unawares in in second Peter chapter
[59:11] 2, he says, "Because there are false
[59:14] prophets and false teachers."
[59:19] And now Paul in in Ephesians chapter
[59:24] 4, he's talking about the five-fold
[59:27] ministry that was
[59:30] given says for the perfecting of the
[59:34] saints, for the work of the
[59:37] ministry, for the edifying of the body
[59:40] of
[59:41] Christ, till we all come in the unity of
[59:44] the faith,
[59:48] Not just the
[59:50] ministers, not just the
[59:52] deacons, not just the song
[59:54] leaders, but until we all come in the
[59:57] unity of
[1:00:00] Christ, till we all come into the
[1:00:02] knowledge of the Son of
[1:00:05] God, unto a perfect
[1:00:09] man, unto the measure of the stature of
[1:00:12] the fullness of
[1:00:15] Christ. So Paul is admonishing
[1:00:18] us. We need to press
[1:00:21] in. There's a
[1:00:24] destination. There's an expected
[1:00:28] end. You've got to press into
[1:00:31] it. In verse
[1:00:34] 14 says that we henceforth be no more
[1:00:40] children. Because what happens if we
[1:00:42] remain children?
[1:00:45] If we don't press
[1:00:47] in, if we don't give
[1:00:50] diligence, he says, "Children tossed to
[1:00:54] and
[1:00:58] froed about with every wind of
[1:01:02] doctrine. By the slight of
[1:01:05] men and cunning
[1:01:08] craftiness, whereby they lie in way to
[1:01:11] deceive.
[1:01:14] So Jude says there's men crept in
[1:01:16] unawares.
[1:01:21] Peter says there's false prophets and
[1:01:23] false
[1:01:26] teachers. But there is a way to not be
[1:01:32] deceived. There is a way to not be blown
[1:01:35] away by winds of doctrine.
[1:01:40] And that is if we give
[1:01:44] diligence to feed upon the
[1:01:48] word to be anchored in the word that God
[1:01:51] reveals to
[1:01:54] us to press into
[1:01:58] it. Say, "Lord, I receive
[1:02:02] it. I believe
[1:02:04] it. Let me live it.
[1:02:08] according as you have revealed it to me.
[1:02:10] Give us our daily
[1:02:13] bread. Give me the word that I need to
[1:02:16] live by
[1:02:19] today. We don't need to worry about
[1:02:23] tomorrow. Jesus didn't say, "Give me
[1:02:26] bread for a
[1:02:29] week." Lord, just give me my daily
[1:02:33] bread so that I know what to do today.
[1:02:39] Because if there ever was a
[1:02:42] day that we could
[1:02:45] say sufficient today is the evil
[1:02:52] thereof. That's
[1:02:54] today. There is enough evil that we face
[1:02:57] in one
[1:02:59] day. That we need our daily bread.
[1:03:04] We need the Lord to keep us every
[1:03:08] moment. We know we need to know each
[1:03:11] step that we need to
[1:03:15] take. Therefore, we must give
[1:03:19] diligence in God's provided way for this
[1:03:24] day. Brother Brandham says God told
[1:03:27] Moses he give him the land.
[1:03:33] He told
[1:03:34] Joshua, "Every place the sole of your
[1:03:37] foot treads, I have given to
[1:03:41] you." But they had to fight for every
[1:03:45] inch of
[1:03:49] it. The promised land is the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:54] It's what you've come into by the new
[1:03:56] birth.
[1:03:59] All of your inheritance is in the Holy
[1:04:02] Ghost. All of your potentials is in the
[1:04:05] Holy
[1:04:07] Ghost. It's already inside of
[1:04:12] you. But he says they had to fight for
[1:04:15] every inch of
[1:04:18] it. So do we fight for every inch of it.
[1:04:25] It isn't something to be
[1:04:31] babyed. Amen. Like God would
[1:04:35] say, "Well, I'll take you over
[1:04:38] there. See what you think about
[1:04:41] it. You can give me your
[1:04:44] opinion." He says, "That's no way to
[1:04:48] come. Come with a determination.
[1:04:53] come that you're going to stay there
[1:04:55] till it's
[1:04:58] over. Stay there till God answers and
[1:05:05] vindicates. We could say, "Well, God
[1:05:07] vindicated the
[1:05:10] prophet." Isn't that good
[1:05:13] enough? But you need a word for you.
[1:05:19] You need God to quicken it to your
[1:05:21] heart.
[1:05:24] The Bible says, "The letter
[1:05:27] killth, but the spirit giveth
[1:05:31] life." If all you have is the words of
[1:05:34] the
[1:05:36] message and the words of the
[1:05:39] Bible, you won't have enough for life.
[1:05:45] But you need the spirit to come behind
[1:05:49] it to quicken what you have need
[1:05:54] of because you need a word from
[1:05:58] God. You need God to show what he's
[1:06:01] speaking to
[1:06:03] you for your
[1:06:05] situation for your
[1:06:08] trial. So he says stay there till God
[1:06:12] answers and vindicates.
[1:06:17] A man that believes in
[1:06:20] God can see the presence of
[1:06:23] God, feel the presence of God,
[1:06:27] sense the presence of
[1:06:30] God and know he's
[1:06:33] here. Says that's the kind of men that
[1:06:36] we need to
[1:06:38] be. He said he is here to answer
[1:06:42] everything.
[1:06:45] that he made promise for in this
[1:06:49] day. Then cry till you get
[1:06:54] it. Hold on to
[1:06:58] him. Don't
[1:07:00] leave. If you have to stay and
[1:07:04] night, God don't want his children to
[1:07:07] listen to intellectual speeches.
[1:07:12] He wants them to cry out to
[1:07:15] it till the promise is
[1:07:21] vindicated. Now, he's not saying you
[1:07:23] need to stay in church day and
[1:07:27] night. He's saying you need to hold on
[1:07:29] to God day and
[1:07:33] night. Stay with it.
[1:07:39] when you when you're dealing with a
[1:07:42] situation, he's saying don't just come
[1:07:45] to God one
[1:07:48] time and say, "Well, I guess I didn't
[1:07:51] hear from
[1:07:53] God." So, I guess I'll just go try the
[1:07:56] best I
[1:07:59] can. But no, he's saying, "Hold on to
[1:08:04] God. He has a word for you.
[1:08:09] He has daily bread for your
[1:08:12] need. So just hold on to
[1:08:15] him. Keep
[1:08:18] feeding. Keep
[1:08:21] searching. Keep
[1:08:23] diligent until he vindicates the word to
[1:08:29] you. This is my word for your
[1:08:33] situation. Amen.
[1:08:36] The Bible says we must give diligence to
[1:08:38] add to our faith virtue.
[1:08:45] By faith we are
[1:08:48] saved that by
[1:08:50] grace. It's not of works lest any man
[1:08:53] should
[1:08:55] boast. We've come to him in
[1:08:58] faith. God's dropped faith into our
[1:09:01] hearts.
[1:09:04] revealed himself to
[1:09:06] us. But now that we have entered into
[1:09:09] Christ,
[1:09:11] we need to add to that faith
[1:09:15] virtue
[1:09:18] diligently. Virtue means strength.
[1:09:24] When a baby is born into the
[1:09:30] world, the first thing it must do is
[1:09:36] eat.
[1:09:37] Why? Because it needs
[1:09:41] strength. When a baby is
[1:09:44] born and it cries
[1:09:47] out, life is
[1:09:50] there. That's not a stillborn child.
[1:09:54] It's
[1:09:55] crying. There's life there.
[1:09:59] And and God put that cry within
[1:10:03] it. It has a desire within
[1:10:08] it. It's
[1:10:10] hungry. The baby doesn't know what it
[1:10:15] needs. The baby doesn't know what food
[1:10:18] is.
[1:10:21] It's been connected to its
[1:10:26] mothering from its mother's side.
[1:10:30] But now it is it is on its
[1:10:34] own and now it has a new
[1:10:39] feeling and it's
[1:10:43] uncomfortable and it causes it to cry
[1:10:45] out in discomfort.
[1:10:49] But it doesn't know what it needs.
[1:10:54] But the mother knows what it needs.
[1:11:11] Maybe the baby wants a new
[1:11:15] car. Maybe the baby is crying for a
[1:11:19] house. Maybe the baby is crying for some
[1:11:23] clothes. But no, we know the baby is
[1:11:26] crying for
[1:11:30] food. And when as soon as the baby
[1:11:33] begins to receive that food,
[1:11:37] it becomes contented.
[1:11:41] Oh, this is what I was looking
[1:11:44] for. This is satisfying that hunger
[1:11:47] within
[1:11:50] me. And so is it when we come to
[1:11:55] God, God says, "Cry out for
[1:11:59] it." You have needs.
[1:12:03] You might not even know what you need.
[1:12:07] You just know that something is wrong.
[1:12:11] You just know that you need more of God.
[1:12:15] You don't know what you need.
[1:12:18] You don't know what word God is going to
[1:12:20] give you
[1:12:21] today, but you know that you need
[1:12:26] it. And when he gives you his
[1:12:29] word, that's where you find
[1:12:31] satisfaction.
[1:12:39] There's many children that have grown up
[1:12:41] in message
[1:12:46] homes, listening to tapes every
[1:12:50] day, hearing good music every
[1:12:54] day. Maybe they were even reading the
[1:12:56] message
[1:12:58] book, but they didn't understand what
[1:13:01] life was all about.
[1:13:05] They didn't really hunger for
[1:13:07] it. They were just living under mom and
[1:13:11] dad. But when the spirit of God be to
[1:13:14] call them
[1:13:17] and they accepted the call of
[1:13:20] God and they received the new
[1:13:23] birth. Now there's a hunger inside of
[1:13:28] them. Now mom and dad doesn't have to
[1:13:31] say, "Pick up your Bible.
[1:13:35] pick up a message
[1:13:37] book. Now they're hungry for
[1:13:41] it. Sometimes, especially as
[1:13:45] children, they can get distracted by the
[1:13:47] things of the
[1:13:49] world and they become
[1:13:53] disgruntled. They become
[1:13:56] upset and they lose their
[1:13:59] peace and but but mom and dad can
[1:14:04] say, "I see you're
[1:14:06] upset. I I I see there's something
[1:14:10] wrong. Have you been spending time with
[1:14:13] God?"
[1:14:15] And we need to remind them,
[1:14:19] you're upset.
[1:14:22] You're not
[1:14:24] yourself because you have not been
[1:14:26] feeding.
[1:14:34] If you've ever had to feed a newborn
[1:14:36] baby with a
[1:14:41] bottle, when Judah was born,
[1:14:45] He had to be in uh intensive
[1:14:52] care because we almost lost him when he
[1:14:55] was
[1:14:58] born. And so he was in the intensive
[1:15:00] care unit.
[1:15:06] And they put the milk into
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:09] bottles so that they could feed him when
[1:15:12] mother wasn't
[1:15:15] there. And I went up there to the room
[1:15:18] where he
[1:15:20] was. And they gave me a bottle to feed
[1:15:24] him. And in that bottle was just a tiny
[1:15:27] bit of milk.
[1:15:31] It was such a small
[1:15:33] amount, but that was all that he could
[1:15:36] handle.
[1:15:41] And when we come to
[1:15:44] Christ, sometimes we can only handle a
[1:15:47] little bit of
[1:15:50] work. We can only handle a little bit at
[1:15:53] a
[1:15:55] time. So, we should not get impatient
[1:15:58] with the children of the Lord.
[1:16:04] But when they are newly birthed into
[1:16:07] Christ, if they've received a little bit
[1:16:10] of
[1:16:12] word and it seems like they're
[1:16:15] full, that's
[1:16:17] okay. Because a baby can only eat a
[1:16:20] little
[1:16:22] bit. But there's something else about a
[1:16:25] baby.
[1:16:27] You can't just feed him that little bit
[1:16:29] of
[1:16:31] milk and then leave him until
[1:16:36] tomorrow. He needs to be fed many times
[1:16:42] today. Just a little bit at a
[1:16:48] time. How did God say that he would
[1:16:50] speak to us?
[1:16:53] He said he would give us line upon
[1:16:58] line, precept upon
[1:17:01] precept. Here a little bit, there a
[1:17:04] little
[1:17:06] bit. Oh, when would this time
[1:17:09] come? when he was doing a new
[1:17:13] thing. When the Holy Ghost was
[1:17:16] come, then his word would begin to teach
[1:17:20] us little by
[1:17:23] little just as much as we could
[1:17:28] sustain that it might bring
[1:17:32] growth. For we are all trying to grow
[1:17:36] into the stature of men.
[1:17:45] The Bible says, "Add to our virtue
[1:17:47] knowledge."
[1:17:51] In Jeremiah 9 and verse
[1:17:55] 23 says, "Thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:18:00] let not the wise man glory in his
[1:18:05] wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory
[1:18:08] in his
[1:18:11] might. Let not the rich man glory in his
[1:18:15] riches.
[1:18:18] But let him that glorieth
[1:18:22] glory in
[1:18:24] this, that he understandeth and knoweth
[1:18:28] me,
[1:18:32] that I am the
[1:18:34] Lord, that I am the
[1:18:37] Lord. Oh, a wise man likes to
[1:18:43] glory. Say, "Oh, I am so wise.
[1:18:47] A rich man likes the
[1:18:50] glory. Say, "Oh, I am so
[1:18:53] rich. A strong man likes to glory."
[1:18:58] Say, "I am so
[1:19:03] strong." But God says, "Let us glory in
[1:19:06] that we know him,
[1:19:11] that I am the Lord.
[1:19:16] Amen. Which exercises loving kindness?
[1:19:23] What kind of a Lord are we glorying
[1:19:27] in? Oh, God burned down
[1:19:31] Sodom. And God sunk Capernium below the
[1:19:38] ocean. You better watch out or the wrath
[1:19:41] of God will come upon you.
[1:19:46] But no, we are to glory in the
[1:19:50] Lord that he is the Lord with ex which
[1:19:54] exercise the loving
[1:20:01] kindness and
[1:20:04] judgment. So don't glory in the wrath of
[1:20:07] God.
[1:20:10] glory in the the judgments of
[1:20:14] God, that his word is
[1:20:17] true, that his word is
[1:20:21] righteous. Oh, there's too many that
[1:20:23] want to glory in themselves
[1:20:26] today. Oh, they can put the scriptures
[1:20:31] together. They can put the quotes
[1:20:35] together. They can condemn you.
[1:20:39] But God says, "Don't glory in our own
[1:20:42] wisdom,
[1:20:45] but glory in the Lord."
[1:20:49] We're not the judge,
[1:20:52] but he is the
[1:20:55] judge. We don't know the hearts of one
[1:20:58] another. We don't know where we are
[1:21:02] at, but God knows where we are at.
[1:21:07] And he exercises loving
[1:21:12] kindness. He exercises
[1:21:16] judgment. He brings us back in line with
[1:21:19] the word of
[1:21:21] God. He exercises
[1:21:26] righteousness. For in these things I
[1:21:29] delight, say the
[1:21:32] Lord, all we can do is preach the word.
[1:21:38] All we can do is give what God lays upon
[1:21:41] our
[1:21:43] heart. God gave these gifts into the
[1:21:49] church so that you would be
[1:21:53] edified as
[1:21:56] babies. You would be given the pure milk
[1:21:59] of the word of
[1:22:01] God that you might
[1:22:04] grow. that you would not just need
[1:22:08] milk, but you would grow to to be able
[1:22:11] to handle the meat of the word of
[1:22:16] God so that you might come to
[1:22:19] maturity, so that you might know who you
[1:22:27] are. Paul says in Ephesians 3,
[1:22:32] he is praying for the church.
[1:22:36] Oh, that you might be strengthened with
[1:22:39] might by his spirit in the inner
[1:22:47] man. That Christ may dwell in your
[1:22:50] hearts by
[1:22:53] faith. That you being rooted and
[1:22:55] grounded in
[1:22:59] love. How can you be rooted and grounded
[1:23:02] in love?
[1:23:06] by
[1:23:07] giving, by giving
[1:23:10] diligence, by being
[1:23:13] faithful, by feeding on the
[1:23:16] word, by accepting what God reveals to
[1:23:20] you. You become rooted and grounded in
[1:23:25] love. Paul's desiring for the
[1:23:29] church that they might know the love of
[1:23:32] God.
[1:23:34] which passes
[1:23:37] knowledge, that you might be filled with
[1:23:39] all the fullness of
[1:23:43] God, that you might know the love of
[1:23:48] God, a a knowing that comes not
[1:23:53] by
[1:23:57] intellect, not by our
[1:24:00] intelligence, not by knowing every
[1:24:03] scripture in
[1:24:05] the not by knowing every quote in the
[1:24:10] message, but that you might know the
[1:24:13] love of
[1:24:15] Christ which passes
[1:24:20] knowledge. So the love of Christ is not
[1:24:22] known by
[1:24:26] knowledge. It passes knowledge.
[1:24:30] It is known only by experience.
[1:24:35] It is known only as we walk with the
[1:24:38] Lord.
[1:24:52] and you're walking with
[1:24:54] him. As many as are led by the spirit of
[1:24:59] God, they are the sons of
[1:25:04] God. So there's a
[1:25:08] relationship. He's leading and you're
[1:25:12] following walking with him day by day.
[1:25:17] We don't leave him at
[1:25:19] church and go do our own
[1:25:22] thing and then come back and see God at
[1:25:26] church. But no, it's a
[1:25:31] relationship where he is leading
[1:25:34] us and we are
[1:25:37] following. It doesn't do any good for
[1:25:40] him to
[1:25:42] lead if we don't follow.
[1:25:46] as he reveals his word to
[1:25:50] us, we have to take that
[1:25:54] step. If we don't take that
[1:25:57] step, he will not go any
[1:26:00] further because he's not going to leave
[1:26:03] us
[1:26:04] behind. He's both the author of our
[1:26:09] faith and the finisher of our faith.
[1:26:13] What he has begun
[1:26:16] He will also finish.
[1:26:19] So every step that he
[1:26:25] reveals, we must follow
[1:26:28] him so that we can walk further in
[1:26:33] Christ. We need to know him by
[1:26:36] experience.
[1:26:44] I could claim to know brother James.
[1:26:50] I could read brother James's life story
[1:26:55] and I could study it
[1:26:59] and I could memorize it
[1:27:03] and I could think I really know brother
[1:27:05] James
[1:27:08] but yet never having met
[1:27:11] him and I could go to brother Steven
[1:27:16] I could say do you know brother
[1:27:20] James, he would say, "Yes, I know
[1:27:22] brother James,
[1:27:24] we are good
[1:27:26] friends. We spend a lot of time
[1:27:28] together."
[1:27:30] And I could say, "Are you sure that you
[1:27:32] really are a friend of brother James?"
[1:27:36] Well, yes. He would say, "I I am."
[1:27:41] And I could say, "Okay, well, let me put
[1:27:43] it to the test."
[1:27:47] I could say, "Brother Steven,
[1:27:50] do you know what kind of toothpaste
[1:27:53] brother James uses?"
[1:28:01] He doesn't know.
[1:28:03] Oh, but I have studied the life of
[1:28:07] Christ. And I could say, "Oh, brother
[1:28:10] James uses Crest toothpaste.
[1:28:15] And if you didn't know
[1:28:18] that then you really don't know
[1:28:24] brother you know we can meet many
[1:28:27] intellectual People
[1:29:07] So we can know we can meet many
[1:29:09] intellectual
[1:29:13] people, people that have studied the
[1:29:16] word of
[1:29:19] God, people that have been to Bible
[1:29:23] schools, people that have got degrees,
[1:29:29] in the Bible
[1:29:32] and they can speak words that you have
[1:29:35] no idea what they're talking about.
[1:29:39] Then they can say, "Do you know about
[1:29:41] this
[1:29:44] concept?" You say, "I never heard about
[1:29:47] it." Oh, do you know what this big word
[1:29:52] means? And and you say, "I've never
[1:29:54] heard of that.
[1:29:56] I have no idea what it means.
[1:29:59] And they would say, uh, if you don't
[1:30:01] know those things, how could you say you
[1:30:03] know
[1:30:08] God? But that's not how we are to know
[1:30:16] him. Down in our heart, we know God
[1:30:22] and we say, "I don't know what that word
[1:30:24] means.
[1:30:27] I don't know what you're talking
[1:30:31] about, but the spirit of God within
[1:30:35] me bears record with my
[1:30:41] spirit that I am a son of
[1:30:48] God. may not know all of the information
[1:30:52] that you
[1:30:56] know, but I know my heavenly
[1:31:00] father for he has quickened my
[1:31:05] heart. He has changed my
[1:31:08] life. He is walking with
[1:31:11] me. He is molding me from day to day.
[1:31:17] He is adding line upon
[1:31:22] line. Glory to
[1:31:25] God. Thank you. Amen. He says in
[1:31:30] question, brother Brandham says in
[1:31:31] questions and
[1:31:34] answers, he says it's not this
[1:31:39] outside our five senses of sea, taste,
[1:31:41] feel, smell, and
[1:31:45] hear. It
[1:31:47] isn't. It's subject to death and it will
[1:31:51] die. But the inside part of
[1:31:56] you down in here
[1:32:00] inside.
[1:32:02] That is the person that cannot die.
[1:32:07] And that's the person that the new life
[1:32:09] starts
[1:32:14] from this new
[1:32:17] birth. And it builds another
[1:32:22] person in the image of this person you
[1:32:25] are.
[1:32:30] around that
[1:32:33] life. So potentially it's in here.
[1:32:39] And what is it? It's the word promised
[1:32:43] before the foundation of the world.
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:49] So it's not this that is on the outside.
[1:32:54] This is just a tool that God is
[1:32:59] using. A tool that came into existence
[1:33:02] by
[1:33:06] sin. Without sin, we would not have this
[1:33:09] fallen nature.
[1:33:13] But God needed a certain tool in his
[1:33:20] toolbox to mold where whereby he might
[1:33:23] mold this inside man.
[1:33:28] So he allowed the fall in the garden of
[1:33:33] Eden so that he might use this fallen
[1:33:38] nature to mold this inside
[1:33:43] man into the person of who you
[1:33:49] are. the person of who you were in the
[1:33:52] mind of
[1:33:56] God from before the foundation of the
[1:33:59] world. So that which is on the
[1:34:03] inside, that's who you
[1:34:06] are. Not who you thought you
[1:34:10] were, not who the devil tells you you
[1:34:13] are, but what does the word say about
[1:34:16] you?
[1:34:19] What does the word say you are?
[1:34:23] The Holy Spirit bears record with our
[1:34:28] spirit that we are the sons of
[1:34:32] God. That's the real
[1:34:36] you. That's the true you.
[1:34:40] And around that
[1:34:42] life, God is bringing you to your full
[1:34:47] potential of who you are in Christ,
[1:34:53] building another
[1:34:56] person. Amen.
[1:34:59] That's why we need to give
[1:35:02] diligence because God is not done
[1:35:04] building.
[1:35:08] If God was done
[1:35:11] building, we would not be here
[1:35:17] anymore. Because God is not the author
[1:35:20] of
[1:35:23] confusion. We say, "Lord, I'm perfect.
[1:35:26] Why am I still
[1:35:29] here?" But we're here because we have
[1:35:31] yet to be perfected.
[1:35:40] Bible says, "Add to your knowledge
[1:35:46] temperance." And temperance is
[1:35:53] self-control. It's by grace that we're
[1:35:57] saved. But many want to take the grace
[1:36:00] of
[1:36:02] God and turn it into
[1:36:08] disgrace. Say, "Oh, now I am saved by
[1:36:12] grace. Therefore, I can do anything I
[1:36:16] want." Because now I'm
[1:36:19] saved. But no, God saved you for a
[1:36:24] purpose. God b brought his grace by your
[1:36:27] way for a purpose.
[1:36:30] Because you were in his mind before the
[1:36:32] foundation
[1:36:34] of whom he
[1:36:38] forneew not who was good
[1:36:42] enough who finally reached a place where
[1:36:45] God would notice
[1:36:49] them. But it's whom he
[1:36:54] forneew by
[1:36:57] election. He knew who was
[1:37:02] his. And Jesus said, "I will not lose
[1:37:06] one of
[1:37:09] them whom he forneew." He
[1:37:16] predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:37:18] image of his son.
[1:37:26] Let's turn to that scripture just for a
[1:37:38] moment. is I know I missed a couple
[1:37:40] words
[1:37:44] there. Romans 8 and verse 29.
[1:37:51] Oh
[1:37:53] yes. So whom he
[1:37:57] forneew them he predestinated to be
[1:38:00] conformed to the image of his
[1:38:05] son that he might be the firstborn among
[1:38:08] many
[1:38:11] brethren. So he recognized God's
[1:38:14] purpose that it wasn't just to save
[1:38:18] us but it was to conform us.
[1:38:24] Not us molding
[1:38:27] ourselves by what we think the word of
[1:38:30] God
[1:38:33] is, but by the filling of his Holy
[1:38:37] Spirit. Now he is molding
[1:38:41] us. He conforms
[1:38:44] us into the image of his
[1:38:47] son that he might be the firstborn among
[1:38:50] many brothers.
[1:38:53] For over whom he did
[1:38:57] predestinate, them he also
[1:39:00] called. And whom he
[1:39:02] called, them he also justified.
[1:39:06] And whom he has justified,
[1:39:10] them he also glorified.
[1:39:14] Christ in you
[1:39:16] is the hope of glory.
[1:39:20] the potentials of bringing you to
[1:39:24] glory. So who he predestinated them he
[1:39:29] called. You might you might think within
[1:39:33] yourself. How could I ever hope to be
[1:39:38] one of God's elected?
[1:39:44] There's so many people in this world
[1:39:46] that look good to our
[1:39:52] eyes, but God doesn't look on the
[1:39:54] outward
[1:39:57] man. God looks on the heart.
[1:40:02] So, we don't need to uh we don't need
[1:40:06] to have our own worries.
[1:40:12] wonder how how could I possibly
[1:40:17] qualify? How could I ever be good
[1:40:22] enough? But you felt a call in your
[1:40:25] heart one
[1:40:27] day. You did not put that call in
[1:40:32] there. No man ever sought
[1:40:36] God, but God seeks man.
[1:40:43] It wasn't Adam in the Garden of Eden
[1:40:45] say, "Oh God, let me come
[1:40:50] back. I have sinned. Let me come back to
[1:40:55] you." But it was God calling
[1:40:59] Adam, saying, "Adam, Adam, where are
[1:41:03] you? You're always here when I come
[1:41:06] down.
[1:41:09] always desiring
[1:41:12] fellowship and something has
[1:41:15] happened. Something has come between
[1:41:19] us and now you are not
[1:41:22] here and now you are hiding from
[1:41:26] me but I am calling for
[1:41:29] you. So you felt a call of God in your
[1:41:35] heart when the word came by your
[1:41:39] way. It was calling your name
[1:41:44] and you fell to
[1:41:46] pull. That's for
[1:41:50] me. There's something in there that's
[1:41:52] calling to
[1:41:55] me. It wasn't you desiring these things.
[1:42:00] It was God calling his
[1:42:04] children. So if you've heard the call of
[1:42:06] God in your
[1:42:09] heart, then you are a son of God.
[1:42:14] You are a daughter of
[1:42:17] God. He doesn't call those that are not
[1:42:21] his. But whom he
[1:42:27] forneew. Amen.
[1:42:34] So we need to add to our knowledge
[1:42:39] temperance which is
[1:42:43] self-control. We are saved by grace for
[1:42:46] a
[1:42:47] purpose to be molded into the image of
[1:42:52] Christ. So he is molding his desires
[1:42:56] into you.
[1:43:00] When when we came to
[1:43:03] Christ, we received the new birth
[1:43:06] and we are now new creatures in
[1:43:10] him. All things have passed
[1:43:13] away and all and all things are become
[1:43:18] new. So our nature now was changed.
[1:43:24] that seed gene within us has sprung
[1:43:26] forth into
[1:43:31] life. But this flesh grew up in the
[1:43:36] world. This flesh was born in
[1:43:40] sin. It was shaped in
[1:43:44] iniquity. It come in the world speaking
[1:43:49] lies. and we're used to living with
[1:43:54] it. And so the devil comes and wants to
[1:43:57] anoint our
[1:44:00] flesh, wants to bring us back to our old
[1:44:06] ways, but that which is on the
[1:44:09] inside now is waring against that which
[1:44:13] is on the outside.
[1:44:20] The spirit wars against the flesh,
[1:44:27] and the flesh lusteth against the
[1:44:33] spirit. These two are contrary one to
[1:44:38] another and they'll always be
[1:44:42] contrary until we receive a new
[1:44:48] body. God is God is not molding our
[1:44:54] flesh. God is molding our
[1:45:00] character. He's molding our
[1:45:02] self-control.
[1:45:06] You have scars in your
[1:45:10] flesh, scars in your spirit,
[1:45:15] but in the soul, you've received a new
[1:45:20] nature. And that nature is pushing out
[1:45:23] from the
[1:45:28] inside, building a new body on the
[1:45:30] inside.
[1:45:35] bringing this flesh into subjection to
[1:45:38] the word of
[1:45:49] God. He is building you into an
[1:45:52] expression of his love.
[1:45:58] Because we know at the top of the
[1:46:00] stature of a perfect man
[1:46:04] is
[1:46:07] charity which is the love
[1:46:12] expressed. It's not just love
[1:46:16] stationary that we have
[1:46:19] love but that we become an expression of
[1:46:24] love. Not an expression of our own
[1:46:28] love but through the molding of God.
[1:46:32] that we might be an expression of the
[1:46:34] love of
[1:46:37] God. And God's love is the most powerful
[1:46:41] force that there
[1:46:47] is. Brother Brandham says when love
[1:46:54] projects, then sovereign grace comes on
[1:46:57] the scene.
[1:47:01] and produces the
[1:47:03] result. When love
[1:47:07] projects, love is the most powerful
[1:47:09] force there
[1:47:12] is. One time, Brother Brandham stepped
[1:47:15] into a
[1:47:18] field. And in that field was a a raging
[1:47:24] bull. And he was
[1:47:26] across the field.
[1:47:31] When the bull noticed
[1:47:34] him and the bull came charging at
[1:47:39] him, he could not stop the
[1:47:42] bull. He could not reach the
[1:47:45] fence. He'd forgotten his
[1:47:48] gun. So, he had no
[1:47:51] protection. And he thought, "Well, this
[1:47:53] is the
[1:47:55] end." But then love projected
[1:48:00] and stopped that bowl in its
[1:48:05] tracks. One time he was mowing his
[1:48:11] backyard and he ran the lawn mower into
[1:48:14] the
[1:48:17] fence and it shook the hornets's nest
[1:48:20] that was
[1:48:23] there and the the hornets came and
[1:48:26] covered brother Brham.
[1:48:32] in ourselves. We would be
[1:48:35] afraid. We would know this. This is
[1:48:38] it. There's no way I can withstand all
[1:48:41] of these
[1:48:44] things. But then something came over
[1:48:48] him. Love
[1:48:51] projected. And he spoke to those
[1:48:55] hornets and they went back to their
[1:48:59] nest without doing any
[1:49:02] harm. Storm came
[1:49:05] in and and the voice of the Lord told
[1:49:08] him, "Go back up the
[1:49:11] mountain into the
[1:49:14] storm." And he thought,
[1:49:17] "Okay, this must be the end."
[1:49:21] But the Lord spoke to
[1:49:23] him and said, "Speak to the
[1:49:26] storm and he spoke to the
[1:49:29] storm and the storm went back to where
[1:49:32] it came
[1:49:33] from. Love
[1:49:37] projected." One day, Hadtie Wright was
[1:49:40] listening to the
[1:49:42] word and she said, "That's nothing but
[1:49:45] the truth.
[1:49:51] and love
[1:49:53] projected. The presence of God came
[1:49:57] down and brother Brandham
[1:50:00] said under the anointing of the Holy
[1:50:04] Spirit, "Ask whatever you will and it'll
[1:50:07] be given to
[1:50:09] you." She said, "What should I ask for?"
[1:50:13] Well, you could ask for a million
[1:50:16] dollars if your parents are
[1:50:18] poor. You could ask for the healing of
[1:50:21] your
[1:50:23] sister who's in a
[1:50:26] wheelchair. Well, she thought about it
[1:50:28] for a little
[1:50:29] bit, for the desire of my
[1:50:34] heart, for the salvation of my two
[1:50:39] boys. And they fell over her lap.
[1:50:44] repenting and giving their hearts to
[1:50:49] God. One day, Brother Brandham was in a
[1:50:54] service. And in the back of the
[1:50:58] church, there was a young
[1:51:01] couple and they were being unclean right
[1:51:04] in the
[1:51:07] service. He was climbing into her lap.
[1:51:12] They were kissing one
[1:51:14] another. The deacons had asked them to
[1:51:18] stop, but they wouldn't
[1:51:21] stop. Brother Brandham had asked them to
[1:51:25] stop, but they wouldn't
[1:51:28] stop. But then the presence of God came
[1:51:31] down in
[1:51:33] them. And they knew that they were in
[1:51:36] trouble.
[1:51:38] They were sitting there white in the
[1:51:42] face and the the the spirit of God spoke
[1:51:45] to brother
[1:51:47] Brandham said whatever you say it'll
[1:51:52] happen and thoughts begin to come to
[1:51:56] him say
[1:52:00] paralysis pack them out of the
[1:52:03] room anything he said would have
[1:52:07] happened. But he
[1:52:09] waited and when the inspiration came
[1:52:12] from the
[1:52:14] Lord, love
[1:52:17] projected and he said, "I forgive
[1:52:21] you and the presence of God came
[1:52:25] down and at the end of the
[1:52:29] service, that couple was the first ones
[1:52:31] at the altar.
[1:52:35] given their hearts to the
[1:52:37] Lord. So love is the most powerful force
[1:52:41] there
[1:52:43] is and God is molding
[1:52:47] you to be a projection of that
[1:52:52] love. Not to be a powerful person in the
[1:52:57] world, not to bring might unto
[1:53:02] yourself, but he is molding
[1:53:05] you that you might be a projection of
[1:53:08] his
[1:53:11] love that your life would project love
[1:53:14] to those around
[1:53:18] you. As many as received him, the Bible
[1:53:21] says,
[1:53:24] to them gave he
[1:53:27] power for
[1:53:28] what? Not power to work signs and
[1:53:33] wonders. Not power to to bring great
[1:53:38] miracles, but power to become the sons
[1:53:41] of God.
[1:53:45] That Holy Ghost power within
[1:53:48] you has all the
[1:53:51] potentials to mold you into the image of
[1:53:56] Christ that you might be a manifested
[1:53:59] son of God.
[1:54:04] Brother Brandham says in the Smyrnian
[1:54:06] church
[1:54:07] age, he says, "Unless we suffer with
[1:54:10] him, we cannot reign with him.
[1:54:16] You have to suffer to
[1:54:19] reign. But remember the
[1:54:23] suffering is not worthy to be compared
[1:54:27] with the
[1:54:30] glory in all the
[1:54:33] trials, all the
[1:54:36] tribulations, all the
[1:54:39] sickness, all the
[1:54:42] hardship, all of the
[1:54:46] suffering is to reveal the glory within
[1:54:53] us. You have to suffer to
[1:54:58] reign. The Bible says we shall reign
[1:55:01] with him upon the
[1:55:04] earth. Says he has made us kings and
[1:55:07] priests unto
[1:55:10] God. It's your
[1:55:13] calling. It's who you will be on the
[1:55:15] other
[1:55:18] side in the new heavens and new
[1:55:21] earth. But he needs to make you ready
[1:55:24] for
[1:55:26] that. So he's molding your
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:31] character. Brother Brandham says the
[1:55:33] reason for
[1:55:36] this that you have to suffer to
[1:55:40] reign is that character simply is never
[1:55:44] made without
[1:55:49] suffering. Character is a victory, not a
[1:55:56] gift. Salvation is a gift.
[1:56:00] The Holy Ghost is a gift,
[1:56:03] but character is a victory.
[1:56:08] We must fight for every inch.
[1:56:16] Bible says of
[1:56:18] Christ in Hebrews chapter
[1:56:21] 5 says, "Though he were a son,
[1:56:25] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:56:28] which he suffered.
[1:56:33] And being made
[1:56:36] perfect, he became the author of eternal
[1:56:40] salvation
[1:56:44] unto all them that obey
[1:56:49] him. Every son that comes to God must be
[1:56:52] chasened,
[1:56:57] must be tried.
[1:57:00] The Bible says in Romans 8:13,
[1:57:05] "If you live after the
[1:57:10] flesh, you shall
[1:57:12] die. But if you through the spirit do
[1:57:15] mortify the deeds of the
[1:57:20] body, you shall live.
[1:57:30] But if the spirit that raised up Jesus
[1:57:33] from the
[1:57:37] dead dwell in
[1:57:40] you, he that raised up Christ from the
[1:57:45] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[1:57:51] bodies. spirit that dwelleth in
[1:57:55] you. And in the message, it is the
[1:57:58] rising of the sun.
[1:58:02] Brother Brennan says, "The the spirit
[1:58:05] that raised him from the
[1:58:09] dead, dwelling in
[1:58:11] you will also bring your mortal
[1:58:16] bodies, the dust of the
[1:58:19] earth into subjection."
[1:58:24] He says, "You see what is it?"
[1:58:28] Subjection to what?
[1:58:30] to Christ.
[1:58:33] Who is Christ?
[1:58:35] The word.
[1:58:37] Not the theology, but the word.
[1:58:43] So the spirit within
[1:58:46] us is tempering our lives.
[1:58:51] Every time we get out of
[1:58:54] line, every time we make a
[1:58:57] mistake, every time we go against the
[1:59:00] word of
[1:59:01] God, the spirit within
[1:59:04] us brings us back in line with the word
[1:59:07] of God.
[1:59:15] Jesus said
[1:59:17] he the when he the spirit of truth is
[1:59:23] come he will guide you into all
[1:59:27] truth. He is
[1:59:29] leading and we are
[1:59:33] following. So and the Bible says to
[1:59:36] temperance we must add patience.
[1:59:42] James said, "Brethren, count it all joy
[1:59:45] when you fall into diverse
[1:59:53] temptation, knowing
[1:59:55] this, that the trying of your faith
[1:59:58] workketh
[2:00:03] patience, but let patience have her
[2:00:05] perfect work.
[2:00:10] that you may be
[2:00:12] perfect and
[2:00:14] entire wanting
[2:00:18] nothing. So how do we reach this place
[2:00:21] where we have
[2:00:24] patience? It's a molding
[2:00:30] process. It takes faith to have
[2:00:32] patience.
[2:00:35] It takes faith to have
[2:00:41] patience. It takes strength in the word
[2:00:43] of God to have
[2:00:48] patience. It takes knowledge to have
[2:00:55] patience. If we know
[2:00:58] God, we've been walking with
[2:01:01] him. We've experienced the way he works.
[2:01:06] We've learned to hold to the promises of
[2:01:11] God. From the little
[2:01:14] things, God doesn't give us a trial we
[2:01:16] can't
[2:01:19] handle. He begins with little
[2:01:22] things that seem so big to
[2:01:26] us. But the reason you're going through
[2:01:30] it is because you can handle
[2:01:35] it. So now as you've grown in
[2:01:39] Christ and he's now tempered you by his
[2:01:45] word through all of these things that
[2:01:47] you've been
[2:01:49] through. Now you learn to have
[2:01:54] patience. I know God will come.
[2:01:58] I know God will
[2:01:59] speak because he did back
[2:02:02] here. He did over
[2:02:05] here. Brother so and so gave this
[2:02:08] testimony. Sister so and so
[2:02:12] gave. I seen God heal me
[2:02:15] here. So I know he'll heal me
[2:02:18] here. I seen God deliver me back
[2:02:22] here. So I know he will deliver me here.
[2:02:26] So through the knowledge of
[2:02:29] him, he has now brought us to this place
[2:02:32] of
[2:02:34] patience and and and we we learn to let
[2:02:38] God let patience have its perfect
[2:02:45] work. We learn to wait on
[2:02:49] God that he has a
[2:02:52] reason why the answer has not come yet.
[2:02:57] When Job went through his
[2:03:00] trial, he knew there was no
[2:03:04] sin. And yet he lost his his all of his
[2:03:08] live, his
[2:03:11] wealth. He lost his
[2:03:14] donkeys. He lost his
[2:03:16] camels. He lost his sheep.
[2:03:20] He lost all of his children.
[2:03:23] His wife turned against him.
[2:03:25] His friends said, "There must be sin in
[2:03:28] your
[2:03:30] life." But he said, "I know I have not
[2:03:34] sinned. I've done all that God showed me
[2:03:37] to
[2:03:39] do. I've kept the word of God that he's
[2:03:42] given to
[2:03:43] me. There must be some other
[2:03:47] purpose." And he patiently waited for
[2:03:51] God.
[2:03:56] the patience of Job.
[2:03:59] And we're called to be just like
[2:04:03] Job that we do all that God calls us to
[2:04:08] do. We believe every word that he's
[2:04:11] revealed to
[2:04:14] us and then we wait for
[2:04:18] God knowing he will come on the scene.
[2:04:24] We don't just wait with our arms
[2:04:28] folded saying one day God will come
[2:04:33] until that day I'll just wait
[2:04:39] here but no we are
[2:04:43] searching we are
[2:04:45] seeking saying Lord what is your
[2:04:49] will is your purpose in this situation
[2:04:54] Where is the answer that I'm waiting
[2:04:57] for? I'm waiting for
[2:05:01] healing. Where is that quickening word?
[2:05:06] I know the Bible
[2:05:08] says that by your stripes I'm
[2:05:12] healed. But where is the quickening
[2:05:15] power?
[2:05:22] patient.
[2:05:28] God has not given us the spirit of fear,
[2:05:34] but of power
[2:05:36] and of
[2:05:38] love and of a sound mind.
[2:05:49] I want to tell you a
[2:05:51] testimony of what God did in our
[2:05:55] home and maybe it will encourage
[2:06:00] you earlier this this summer.
[2:06:07] My wife began to experience a lot of
[2:06:10] pain
[2:06:14] and I began to notice that she was
[2:06:19] uncomfortable. And I said, "Are you
[2:06:23] hurting?" She said, "Oh, maybe a little
[2:06:26] bit, but I'm sure it'll be
[2:06:30] okay." And I said, "Okay."
[2:06:34] and and uh I kept watching her
[2:06:39] and I seen that the pain was not going
[2:06:41] away
[2:06:43] and it was getting
[2:06:45] worse and I said do you want to go to
[2:06:49] the
[2:06:50] doctor find out what's
[2:06:53] wrong? She said no I I don't want to go
[2:06:56] to the
[2:06:57] doctor. And we waited a few more
[2:07:01] days and she was still in
[2:07:04] pain. And I said, "We're taking you to
[2:07:06] the
[2:07:07] doctor. We're going to find out what's
[2:07:11] wrong. We know that God is our
[2:07:15] healer. But let's go find out what's
[2:07:19] wrong. Maybe there's a simple solution."
[2:07:24] And so we went to the
[2:07:26] doctor and the doctor told
[2:07:30] her as my wife told her all of her
[2:07:36] symptoms and that she was having pain in
[2:07:39] her
[2:07:42] abdomen and it wouldn't go
[2:07:45] away and she could feel something inside
[2:07:48] of
[2:07:50] her and the doctor said, "I think you
[2:07:52] have a growth.
[2:07:56] a
[2:07:58] tumor. So we must send you for
[2:08:02] tests. So the doctor booked her for
[2:08:07] tests. She went for an
[2:08:11] ultrasound and and uh the doctor did the
[2:08:15] ultrasound and did I think a CT scan.
[2:08:21] Um I'm not exactly sure of all the names
[2:08:23] of the tests,
[2:08:30] but but they said yes, you have a growth
[2:08:32] in
[2:08:35] you there. There's a tumor about the
[2:08:38] size of an
[2:08:41] orange in your your female
[2:08:45] parts and it must be removed
[2:08:48] immediately.
[2:08:52] So she went home
[2:08:55] and she began to
[2:08:57] pray because she was
[2:09:00] afraid. She said, "This could be
[2:09:03] cancer. I have six
[2:09:06] children. What could happen to
[2:09:08] me?" So she begin to
[2:09:10] pray. Say, "Lord, I need
[2:09:13] you. I need you to come on the scene for
[2:09:16] me.
[2:09:17] I need your healing virtues in my life.
[2:09:22] She was
[2:09:24] afraid of what might happen to
[2:09:27] her. So we had a visiting minister
[2:09:32] come brother Ed
[2:09:35] Hammermeister maybe you know
[2:09:37] him and and he ministered the
[2:09:41] word and God spoke to my wife.
[2:09:51] And he he was telling the story of
[2:09:53] brother
[2:09:55] Brham, how that when brother Brandham
[2:09:58] was out
[2:10:00] hunting, how God had shown him a
[2:10:03] vision, how he would shoot the big
[2:10:07] caribou. And before he got back to
[2:10:11] camp, he would also shoot a big grizzly
[2:10:14] bear.
[2:10:17] And so he was on this hunting
[2:10:20] trip and he shot the big
[2:10:26] caribou and they were walking down the
[2:10:30] mountain and you could see for miles
[2:10:35] around and it didn't look like there was
[2:10:38] any grizzly bear
[2:10:42] there. And the hunting guide
[2:10:46] said to brother
[2:10:47] Brham, "Didn't you say there was going
[2:10:50] to be a grizzly bear?"
[2:10:53] Brother Brandham said, "Are you doubting
[2:10:55] the
[2:10:59] vision?" The hunting guide
[2:11:03] said, "I no, I'm not
[2:11:07] doubting. I've seen God do too
[2:11:10] much that I can't doubt the vision.
[2:11:14] And so they carried
[2:11:17] on. They were getting close to the
[2:11:22] camp. And brother Brandham says, "What's
[2:11:25] that over
[2:11:27] there?" And there was that grizzly
[2:11:32] bear. They could see for miles
[2:11:36] around. And all of a sudden, here was
[2:11:39] this grizzly
[2:11:41] bear fulfilling the
[2:11:44] vision. And and so this brother was
[2:11:48] preaching, showing that when God had
[2:11:51] given his
[2:11:53] word, it might look
[2:11:57] impossible, but between here and
[2:12:01] there, God is going to come on the
[2:12:04] scene.
[2:12:06] So that anchored within the heart of my
[2:12:10] wife and and and I caught
[2:12:13] it. I said I said I I think that was for
[2:12:18] you. She said yes that was for
[2:12:21] me. I received it for
[2:12:25] me. And from that
[2:12:28] time all of the fear was gone.
[2:12:33] We have not received the spirit of
[2:12:37] fear, but of
[2:12:40] power and of
[2:12:42] love and of a sound mind.
[2:12:47] So when the word of God came for her
[2:12:52] situation that it might look
[2:12:55] impossible, but between here and
[2:12:59] there, God is going to come on the
[2:13:03] scene. And she knew that God was saying
[2:13:06] to
[2:13:08] her that between now and the surgery,
[2:13:15] God is going to come on the
[2:13:18] scene. She knew the word said that by
[2:13:21] his stripes we are
[2:13:24] healed. But she needed God to come and
[2:13:26] vindicate his word.
[2:13:30] She needed God to bring the spirit
[2:13:32] behind the
[2:13:35] word and she had been molded by the word
[2:13:38] of
[2:13:40] God. One time my son fell out of a
[2:13:45] tree and came crying
[2:13:48] inside and he had a big lump on his
[2:13:53] back. And so she laid him on the couch.
[2:13:58] She phoned me and said, "What should I
[2:14:00] do?" I was out of town
[2:14:04] working. I said, "Just lay your hands on
[2:14:07] him and pray for
[2:14:09] him." And she laid her hands on him and
[2:14:12] prayed for
[2:14:14] him. And then she left him on the
[2:14:18] couch and soon she looked
[2:14:22] outside and there was my son playing
[2:14:25] outside.
[2:14:28] [Applause]
[2:14:30] She she said, "Why are you
[2:14:33] outside? Come here." And she lifted up
[2:14:36] his shirt.
[2:14:38] And the lump was
[2:14:41] gone. So she had seen God come on the
[2:14:45] scene. He beholded her
[2:14:49] faith through the little
[2:14:52] things, preparing her for each trial
[2:14:55] that lies.
[2:14:59] And now when God quickened the word for
[2:15:02] her
[2:15:06] situation, she knew it was God's
[2:15:10] word. And the spirit of God removed all
[2:15:16] fear. Perfect
[2:15:19] love casts out all fear.
[2:15:25] But she still felt that lump
[2:15:29] inside. She went to another test after
[2:15:32] those services.
[2:15:36] They said, "Yes, that lump is
[2:15:40] there and it needs to be
[2:15:43] removed." But there was no
[2:15:46] fear. And they booked the surgery.
[2:15:51] God never told us what he was going to
[2:15:55] do. He never told us when it was going
[2:15:58] to
[2:15:59] happen. He just confirmed to us that it
[2:16:02] was going to
[2:16:07] happen. So we went to the
[2:16:11] surgery resting in the promises of God.
[2:16:16] In the morning of the
[2:16:18] surgery, she still felt that lump
[2:16:23] inside and she lay there on the
[2:16:27] bed and we were there was no
[2:16:33] fear. I brought her to the
[2:16:36] hospital and I and then I went to
[2:16:40] work. I can't explain why I would go to
[2:16:43] work.
[2:16:47] We were driving to the
[2:16:50] hospital and I said, "I'm so
[2:16:55] sorry. I haven't been worried about you
[2:16:58] at
[2:17:01] all. I haven't even been praying about
[2:17:06] it." She said, "That's
[2:17:09] okay. I haven't been worried about it
[2:17:12] either.
[2:17:15] So I left her there in the hospital
[2:17:17] bed and went to
[2:17:20] work and and they they took her into the
[2:17:25] surgery. They called me when they were
[2:17:27] done
[2:17:29] and I came back
[2:17:32] and she was sleeping on the bed
[2:17:36] just beginning to wake up out of the
[2:17:41] medication and the nurse came into the
[2:17:43] room
[2:17:47] and we asked her how did the surgery go?
[2:17:52] She said well let me read the report.
[2:17:56] And she began reading the
[2:17:59] report and she was looking at the commu
[2:18:02] computer
[2:18:05] monitor and she was
[2:18:08] frowning and she was
[2:18:10] looking. She was
[2:18:12] reading. We said, "So, how did the
[2:18:15] surgery
[2:18:17] go?" She said, "It doesn't look like
[2:18:20] they removed anything.
[2:18:26] So we said, "Okay."
[2:18:29] And she we said, "So so was there
[2:18:32] nothing in there?"
[2:18:35] She said, "Well, you have to wait for
[2:18:37] the doctor to
[2:18:38] come." And it didn't seem like the
[2:18:41] doctor was going to come again. It
[2:18:44] didn't seem like the doctor was
[2:18:47] coming. The nurse said, "You'll have an
[2:18:50] appointment in 6 weeks.
[2:18:56] and then you can find out from the
[2:18:59] doctor. But just then the doctor walked
[2:19:02] into the
[2:19:06] room. He said, "You don't need a six
[2:19:09] week
[2:19:12] appointment." He said, "We went in to do
[2:19:15] the
[2:19:17] surgery and there was nothing in there.
[2:19:23] Between here and there, God had come on
[2:19:26] the
[2:19:30] scene. It looked
[2:19:33] impossible. the very morning of the
[2:19:37] surgery, as she was getting ready to be
[2:19:39] rolled in the
[2:19:42] room, she knew it was still inside of
[2:19:45] her. And and there had been some some
[2:19:48] confusion with the
[2:19:54] tests. One one report said it's on the
[2:19:57] left
[2:19:59] side. One report said it's on the right
[2:20:02] side.
[2:20:04] So as the doctor was bringing her into
[2:20:06] the
[2:20:09] room, he said the only question
[2:20:13] is whether it's on the right side or the
[2:20:15] left
[2:20:18] side. But when he went in to do the
[2:20:22] surgery, there was nothing
[2:20:26] there. He said, "We could see a little
[2:20:28] spot where it used to
[2:20:32] be, but there was nothing on the left
[2:20:34] side and nothing on the right
[2:20:37] side. And everything looks perfectly
[2:20:42] normal. So, we gave God the glory.
[2:20:49] But there was a reason for the
[2:20:53] surgery because a few days
[2:20:58] later, those pains begin to come
[2:21:03] back and I and I asked I asked my
[2:21:08] wife said, "Are you feeling pain
[2:21:12] again?" She said,
[2:21:14] "Yes." I said, "Do you want to go to the
[2:21:16] doctor?
[2:21:19] and we had a we had a word of prayer
[2:21:21] together
[2:21:24] and and and
[2:21:28] and I began to see I could see the the
[2:21:32] purpose of the
[2:21:36] surgery because if there had been no
[2:21:40] surgery then the devil could
[2:21:43] say see you were never really healed.
[2:21:48] But because the doctor had done the
[2:21:50] surgery,
[2:21:53] she could say, "No, I know that God
[2:21:55] healed
[2:21:58] me beyond the shadow of a
[2:22:03] doubt." So I encouraged
[2:22:07] her, "The same God, you know that God
[2:22:10] did a miracle in your life.
[2:22:14] The same God that healed you the first
[2:22:18] time can also heal you the second time.
[2:22:24] I said, "Are you just hoping that God's
[2:22:26] going to make you
[2:22:29] better or are you trusting in the word
[2:22:32] of
[2:22:34] God?" She said, "No, I am trusting in
[2:22:37] the word of
[2:22:39] God." And a few days after that,
[2:22:44] I asked her, "How are you
[2:22:47] feeling?" She said, "What do you
[2:22:51] mean?" I said, "Those pains that you
[2:22:54] were feeling."
[2:22:57] Oh, she
[2:22:58] said, "I haven't felt any pain now for a
[2:23:02] long
[2:23:04] time." And since that time, she's never
[2:23:07] felt pain anymore.
[2:23:13] So we need to have confidence in the
[2:23:15] word of God.
[2:23:19] He has given us exceeding great and
[2:23:22] precious
[2:23:24] promises that by these we might be
[2:23:28] partakers of his divine
[2:23:33] nature. So the promise is in the
[2:23:38] word but now the molding
[2:23:42] comes. Are you going to believe what the
[2:23:45] word of God says about
[2:23:47] you or are you going to believe what the
[2:23:50] devil wants to tell you?
[2:23:54] Brother Brandham says,
[2:23:58] he says,
[2:23:59] "When when we refuse the devil's
[2:24:06] lie," and I'm just
[2:24:09] paraphrasing. But when we refuse what
[2:24:12] the devil says about
[2:24:18] it, church believes what the word of God
[2:24:22] says about
[2:24:26] it, then the gates of hell cannot
[2:24:29] prevail against
[2:24:34] you. God is molding
[2:24:37] you. God is perfecting your
[2:24:41] life. Not this
[2:24:43] flesh, but he's perfecting your
[2:24:45] character.
[2:24:49] to believe the word of
[2:24:51] God, no matter what the
[2:24:54] trial, no matter what situation you find
[2:24:58] yourself, no matter what sickness comes
[2:25:02] upon that you believe the word of
[2:25:05] God, you hold to his
[2:25:11] promises. That's a Christlike character.
[2:25:15] Crystal,
[2:25:19] why don't we stand together?
[2:25:23] [Applause]
[2:25:29] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[2:25:31] prayer.
[2:25:33] Precious heavenly father,
[2:25:37] Lord, your word is the truth
[2:25:41] and we love it more than anything else
[2:25:44] in the world.
[2:25:47] Lord, you said the greatest
[2:25:53] commandment was to love the Lord our
[2:25:57] God with all our
[2:25:59] heart, with all our
[2:26:02] mind, with all our
[2:26:05] soul. And Lord, we that that isn't just
[2:26:09] words to us, oh God,
[2:26:13] but Lord, we've really come to love you
[2:26:15] that much.
[2:26:19] We pray, Father, that you would continue
[2:26:22] to increase our
[2:26:26] faith. Don't give up on us when we make
[2:26:32] mistakes. And we know that you won't.
[2:26:36] because you said, "I will never leave
[2:26:39] you. I will never forsake you."
[2:26:43] Lord, may we not give up on
[2:26:47] ourselves despite what circumstances
[2:26:50] might
[2:26:53] say. May we believe what your word
[2:26:58] says. and may we find strength in your
[2:27:03] word to stand in this evil
[2:27:07] day in Jesus name we pray.
[2:27:11] Amen. Amen.
[2:27:15] Amen. God bless you.
[2:27:18] [Music]
[2:27:28] God bless
[2:27:29] you. We may be seated.
[2:27:32] Brother Joshua, you can come.
[2:27:37] Amen. Are you blessed this
[2:27:42] afternoon? When it comes to
[2:27:48] suffering, yes, we shall suffer.
[2:27:52] But that suffering cannot be
[2:27:55] compared to the glory that shall be
[2:27:58] revealed in
[2:28:00] us. So the full opening of the
[2:28:04] word could only come to this
[2:28:07] age. And we thank God because we have
[2:28:10] this
[2:28:12] age. And he says if it came in the time
[2:28:15] of you know
[2:28:18] Jeremiah then of course the rapture
[2:28:20] would have taken
[2:28:22] place and God needed
[2:28:25] you to be part of
[2:28:27] it and you need to thank
[2:28:30] God that you are part of what God is
[2:28:33] doing
[2:28:34] now. So if we suffer with
[2:28:37] him we shall rule with him. When you
[2:28:41] choose Christ,
[2:28:43] Amen. Amen. The world will certainly,
[2:28:47] you know, reject you.
[2:28:51] So we thank God for our brother Steven.
[2:28:54] Amen. Amen. For the burden he has had
[2:28:57] for
[2:28:59] us that God
[2:29:01] himself is doing the
[2:29:05] conforming, conforming us into his own
[2:29:07] image.
[2:29:10] He's giving us of his own virtuous
[2:29:14] life. And he says, "Upon your faith
[2:29:18] advert." It's not what we worked
[2:29:21] for, but the grace that God has been
[2:29:24] conferring upon
[2:29:26] us. He's giving us his
[2:29:29] nature, becoming
[2:29:32] partakers of that glorious nature.
[2:29:36] Amen. Brother Steven called it
[2:29:40] creating his desires in
[2:29:44] us. Amen. Amen. Are you feeling that
[2:29:48] way? Day after day, God is changing
[2:29:52] you so that we can become the
[2:29:55] expressions of his
[2:29:57] love. Amen. Like the brother said, your
[2:30:01] life in
[2:30:02] itself becomes the expression of God's
[2:30:06] love. Amen. He has loved you. He has
[2:30:10] brought you that far. He's not going to
[2:30:13] give up on you. He'll work on
[2:30:16] you until he brings you into the stage
[2:30:20] of a
[2:30:22] perfect. God knows what he's doing with
[2:30:25] our God bless you. Amen. Let's have
[2:30:28] brother Joshua. Did you love the
[2:30:30] ministry of the brother?
[2:30:33] Amen. Amen. There is such a
[2:30:37] depth especially the revelation of
[2:30:41] Christ knowing
[2:30:43] Christ not by the
[2:30:45] letter but by the experience of a
[2:30:51] relationship. Amen. Not what we have
[2:30:54] studied much as it helps us but there
[2:30:58] must be a
[2:31:00] way to break into relationship with him.
[2:31:05] by
[2:31:07] relationship. We may never be able to
[2:31:10] know certain
[2:31:12] details and that is true. You will never
[2:31:16] know everything in the
[2:31:18] world because you can only
[2:31:21] know what pertains to your
[2:31:25] part as far as God is concerned with
[2:31:29] you. Amen. Amen. God will only reveal
[2:31:34] what is necessary for you and at a
[2:31:37] certain season of your
[2:31:39] life and that's what will be
[2:31:42] necessary to give you the rapturing
[2:31:46] power. Amen. Amen. Do you love him?
[2:31:49] Amen. We are part of the
[2:31:52] world. We are not all the
[2:31:55] world but you are a part of the word
[2:31:59] that God wants you to be.
[2:32:01] I am a
[2:32:02] verse as you are a verse. And every one
[2:32:06] of us is a verse from the
[2:32:09] world to portray what God wanted you to
[2:32:13] portray to become the expression of
[2:32:17] Islam in the age where we are living.
[2:32:20] Amen. We thank God. We appreciate our
[2:32:23] brother. God bless you. Amen. Amen. So
[2:32:28] let's have brother Joshua.
[2:32:31] lead us a little bit in worship.
[2:32:34] Amen. Amen. And then give us the
[2:32:37] instructions of our
[2:32:38] return. I told you by the devil trying
[2:32:41] to tamper with what he
[2:32:44] did. He was trying to stop
[2:32:48] this. Thank God we got it.
[2:32:54] [Applause]
[2:32:58] [Music]
[2:33:08] and I request that we
[2:33:12] [Music]
[2:33:14] stand. I know whom have believed
[2:33:19] and I'm persuaded that he's
[2:33:21] able. Passover. But I
[2:33:27] know I've
[2:33:30] believed and I'm
[2:33:34] persuaded that he's
[2:33:39] able to keep
[2:33:42] that which
[2:33:46] means and to
[2:33:49] him against the death. But I know But I
[2:33:57] know whom have
[2:34:01] believe and I'm
[2:34:05] persuaded that he's
[2:34:09] able to give
[2:34:13] the
[2:34:17] [Music]
[2:34:21] command. I know not
[2:34:24] why. I know not why. God wonderous grace
[2:34:32] to
[2:34:34] me he may
[2:34:39] know. No
[2:34:41] one unworthy.
[2:34:44] Christ in love
[2:34:49] redeemed me
[2:34:52] before. Oh, but I know but I
[2:34:57] know whom I
[2:35:00] [Music]
[2:35:01] believe and I'm
[2:35:05] persuaded that he is
[2:35:09] able to give life.
[2:35:14] We shall be
[2:35:17] there until
[2:35:20] he again.
[2:35:27] [Music]

[2:37:30] father, king of glory. Lord, we want to
[2:37:32] thank you. We appreciate you, heavenly
[2:37:35] father, king of glory, for the word,
[2:37:38] heavenly father, that has come our way,
[2:37:41] father, this morning. The trials father
[2:37:45] Lord that we go through, the suffering,
[2:37:48] oh king of glory that we go through, it
[2:37:51] cannot be compared to the glory that we
[2:37:54] shall receive.
[2:37:56] Father, we read in your word about Job.
[2:38:00] Father, he was tried. He lost many
[2:38:04] things. But father at the end of it all,
[2:38:07] oh king of glory, Lord God, the
[2:38:09] suffering, oh king of glory, that you
[2:38:11] took him through was to mold his
[2:38:15] character. The suffering that he went
[2:38:17] through was to shape his character until
[2:38:21] Father he was able to confess naked came
[2:38:25] I in this world and naked will I go out
[2:38:29] of this world and blessed be the name of
[2:38:32] the Lord. Father, we want to come, oh
[2:38:34] Lord, to such a confession. Oh, heavenly
[2:38:37] father, in our lives, Lord, when we are
[2:38:40] distressed in our lives, oh heavenly
[2:38:42] father, may our confession still be
[2:38:45] positive. Oh Lord, even when, oh king of
[2:38:49] glory, we are deep down in sickness. So
[2:38:53] heavenly father, may we have a positive
[2:38:56] confession, Lord, in our lives, oh king
[2:38:59] of glory, because father, we know that
[2:39:03] all things work together for good to
[2:39:05] them that love him, Father, we always
[2:39:08] want, oh king of glory, Lord God, that
[2:39:11] through the suffering that we go
[2:39:13] through, oh Lord, we know, oh Lord, that
[2:39:16] you are not a God of frustration. You
[2:39:18] have a purpose, or king of glory. You
[2:39:21] have a a plan, oh king of glory, Lord.
[2:39:25] You have an expected end, oh heavenly
[2:39:27] father, that you desire to bring us to.
[2:39:30] Oh king of glory, may you help us, oh
[2:39:33] king of glory, Lord God, in our times of
[2:39:36] unbelief. For heavenly father, may you
[2:39:39] hold us, oh king of glory. Lord, as we
[2:39:42] hold on to you, oh king of glory, Lord,
[2:39:45] we've been told, oh heavenly father,
[2:39:46] this morning, Lord, never to let go,
[2:39:49] Lord, like Abraham, oh Lord, waiting
[2:39:53] patiently for the promise. Oh king of
[2:39:55] glory Lord 25 years oh heavenly father
[2:39:59] still holding on oh king of glory may
[2:40:02] you help us to hold on oh king of glory
[2:40:05] because it is you heavenly father who
[2:40:07] has given the word oh lord you have
[2:40:10] given the promise oh king of glory and
[2:40:13] father we know lord that whatever comes
[2:40:16] out of your mouth oh lord had not
[2:40:18] returned void oh heavenly father we want
[2:40:21] to hold on to that oh king of glory lord
[2:40:24] god God, we want to believe every
[2:40:26] promise. Oh, heavenly father, like we
[2:40:29] have been told. Oh father, every one of
[2:40:31] us, oh Lord, is a verse. Oh Lord, every
[2:40:34] one of us is a chapter of the book. Oh
[2:40:36] Lord, may you help us, oh Lord, that we
[2:40:39] can be, oh heavenly father, true
[2:40:41] manifestations of your word. Oh Lord,
[2:40:44] when our time comes, oh heavenly father,
[2:40:46] to manifest longsuffering, oh father, I
[2:40:49] pray that our chapter, oh king of glory,
[2:40:52] may bring forth a positive
[2:40:54] manifestation. Oh king of glory, if it
[2:40:57] is our time, oh heavenly father, to
[2:41:00] manifest, oh king of glory, the
[2:41:02] goodness, oh heavenly father, to
[2:41:04] manifest, oh king of glory, Lord God,
[2:41:07] faith in your word, oh Lord, may it be
[2:41:09] so. Heavenly Father, we want to thank
[2:41:12] you and we appreciate you Lord for your
[2:41:15] word that has been spoken unto us. And
[2:41:17] Lord, we pray heavenly father that you

[2:41:21] precious brother. Father, may you
[2:41:23] restore strength to him, oh Lord, even
[2:41:25] for the service in the afternoon. Oh
[2:41:27] Lord and even for these your children.
[2:41:30] Lord I pray may you continue father to
[2:41:32] come and speak to us words of life to
[2:41:35] encourage us oh heavenly father. Father
[2:41:38] that the suffering that we are going
