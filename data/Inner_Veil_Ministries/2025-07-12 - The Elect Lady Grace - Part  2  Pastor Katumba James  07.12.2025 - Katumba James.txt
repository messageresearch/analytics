We can ourselves who we are. Praise the name. Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for this afternoon, for the grace again you've given unto us, Father, that we can come into your presence, Lord. How we are grateful that Lord, you've made yourself known unto us and that we are able to know that our names are written in the Lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. And we're here, heavenly father, to respond to the calling of our names. You may speak to us again and help us in all our weaknesses and failures. That father, we may do that which is right and acceptable before. Bless our hearts, heavenly father. Let the joy of the Lord fill our hearts. Make yourself known unto us even more. We love you and we bless you, Lord. In the name of the Lord Jesus pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us go back to second John still. &gt;&gt; I just we just handled only part of what that subject was and I feel maybe we just continue in the same afternoon. First John, 2 John rather chapter 1 verse one verse3 the Bible says the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and not I only but also they that have known the truth. for the truth's sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us forever. Grace be with you. Mercy, peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God in truth and in love. May God bless his word. We are still continuing with our subject. The elect lady grace. Praise the name of our lord. You know the spirit works in different ways. Praise the name of our lord. You know there is sometimes there's a way the spirit can work at this time and then there's also again can work in another time praise the name of our lord pastor was always saying that when brother perig was speaking brother perig would say those who love the church. Those who love the church, they come on Sunday morning. Then those who love the pastor, they come in the Sunday afternoon. Then who those who love God, they come on Wednesday. Praise the name of Lord. And then you find that every time there is where the spirit moves when it is a mixed multitude. There is how the spirit works. When it is an inner room when he was outside would speak a lot of things and not get you. But when he would come with the few then he reveals more. Praise the name of the Lord. We just need to have a desire of more of God in our lives. So now you see here that brother Brandham was calling the church misgrace. It's actually by the grace of God that we are what we are. It's not our ability at all. It's the grace that God gives us that you know from one year to another standing you are moving even when other people are falling away even when other people don't see what you see but then God gives you the grace that you are able to press on you able to stand on now in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday done forever It says the first chapter of Jeremiah fourth verse I believe it is God said before you was even formed in your mother's belly. I knew you and called you and sanctified you and ordained you a prophet over the nations before he was ever born. You believe in predestination for ordination. You know, we could go right on down through the scripture. Yes, sir. It's all together by grace. It is not by our desire. It is by grace. God called Abraham out of the whole world of people. Why was it? Because Abraham was better. No sir, it is grace. God is chosen, election, and call. You are what you are. Because the grace of God has made you what you are. Who taking thought can add one to his teacher? Is that right? It's by grace these things are called God has set in the church. So now one thing we need to appreciate that our salvation is of the Lord. It's not of your ability. Praise the name of our Lord. It's by grace that God called you. It's by grace that God revealed himself to you. Not because you say, you know, I born from a religious family. Oh, you know, I've never done this thing. It is God himself that ordained the path you have to go through and then you found yourself. Praise the name of the Lord. There is something pressing you in your heart. Maybe let me pass this side or let me go to this grocery or let me listen to this program or let me go by that church. There was just something that was drawing him. You see even people who say that me I sought God it is God that puts that burden upon you to seek him. Praise the name of our Lord. You know when you read in the messages and even when you read in the scriptures you'll find that something God starts working in your life and then there's a desire something that keeps pulling you pulling you or sometimes you in a school and then there's a particular person there may not be the famous person may not be you know anything you need but you find you are drawn on to that person along the path you find that God uses that person for you to find a truth. Praise the name of our Lord. That's how God works. When the Lord wanted to reveal himself to brother Brana, you know, he had a burden. He started a burden, you know, and then he said, "I have to go and wait on the Lord. I cannot continue living with these things. Everybody is criticizing me and telling me that there's something wrong in my life. So he told his wife, I'm going to wait on the Lord. If I don't come back, I'm not coming back. But let me know why I'm sold this kind of life. Everybody is telling me there's something wrong with my life. It was a burden that the Lord put upon him because God wanted to visit him. Praise the name of our Lord. You see, that's how things work out. The Lord moves you to do something because there's something he wants to do. When the Lord wanted to take the gospel to the Gentiles, he moved Cornelius to go into a praying and a fasting session. And then when Cornelius was praying and fasting, you know, and then the angel comes down and says, "God has heard your prayer. Are you pleased with your arms?" And then he told him, "If you want to do better, send for Peter." And then you see on the other side Peter was also in praying I'm waiting on the Lord and then was saying Lord God had put a burden upon him AND WHEN HE KEPT ON praying he started feeling hungry and then a vision came and then it came three TIMES TELLING HIM SLAY and kill said I've never eaten such things and then the Bible says the Holy Spirit tells him Don't call what God has sanctified defiled. Then he started wondering what does this mean? And at that same time the men sent by Cornelius already knocking at the door. God working from either side. Praise the name of our Lord. He moves your heart to a particular section, you know, and then because there is a response like brother Brandon preaches, the deep calls the deep, there has to be a response before there is a need. He said, "How dare be a fish with, you know, with fins? Ah no, not scary. You know how could the fish swim when there's no water? How would the earth grow in the earth if the earth was not there? How would the tree grow in the earth if the earth was not there? So the first thing which was meant to be there is the water. And then God told the waters to bring forth the fish. the tree. How would it be there if the earth was not there? So God made the the earth and then he told the earth bring the trees. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So it starts from what is needed and then the need comes. Praise the name of the Lord. And that's the same thing in our lives. If you have a need, if you feel a burden, if you feel a desire, you have it because there is a response waiting. Praise the name of our Lord. So then what do you do? Lord, I'm here waiting to receive my response. Praise the name of the Lord. So now God in his sovereign, he set some to do a certain work. Praise the name of our Lord. He ordained. He chose. Praise the name of our Lord. And now we are in the message adoption. He says, &gt;&gt; "When were our names put in the lamb's book of life? When was the lamb slain before when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world? When God was Jehovah, &gt;&gt; l Elohim, &gt;&gt; the selfexistence one, &gt;&gt; one like a great big diamond. He could not be nothing else. But inside of this diamond, his attribute was a savior. In this attribute, on the inside of him was a healer. Well, there was nothing to save and nothing to heal. But his attributes produced it. So then before the foundation of the world, when he known that the great display is in here of him, that he would be a savior, that he would come and be made flesh and dwelt among us. And he knowed and he knowed by his stripes would be healed. slain the lamb on his book before the foundation of the world and wrote your name on the book before the foundation of the world. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he says election looks back to for knowledge. and predestination looks to destiny. Now the the prophet is telling to be chosen. He had first forward knowledge. You know, before there was anything, God knew everything. And after knowing everything, he knew that Isaac would give birth to two sons, the first born Esau, the second born Jacob is for one knowledge. So even if he's the first born, even if he's loved by his father, you despise the firstborn, the birthight, he knew that with every opportunity he had, he never regretted the things of God until when it came the time of his marriage. He was maring around the place. Neighbor's daughter here, the other one there, the other one there until it became grievious to his father. That was Esau. So God by forward knowledge that he wouldn't care about the God. He would care about his choices. So now the foreign knowledge of God made God to reject Esau and elect Jacob. Even Jacob had his weaknesses. BUT GOD by foreign knowledge he chose Jacob. And then he said Jacob have love. Praise the name of our Lord. Then now after he has chosen then he predestinates he determines the destiny. He determined the destiny of Jacob. And then he say for Jacob's destiny to be there, I must reveal my secret to the mother and tell the mother, "The younger shall rule the older, but the father, my son is Esau. We go with him to hunting. He doesn't stay in the house like Jacob. That means going all the time. &gt;&gt; So what did God do? &gt;&gt; Isaac, a prophet, &gt;&gt; you know, he gave birth to these children when he was 40 years. And Isaac lived for many years older than even Abraham. Think about60 or something years. But now when you look at this, you'll find that almost half of Isaac's life, he was blind. But he was a prophet OF GOD. SO GOD to make the destiny come to pass to become blind. Blind So that the blessing would pass on to Jacob not &gt;&gt; the father loves praise the name of our lord and the mother knew he was there in the house when the father was telling his son my son I'm here in your father wants to give you land and he says that you bring and then for you refuse. So even Isaac told the son give me that meal which is very good and hunt and bring for me and I eat then I bless you my son. Now before that had sold his birthight for food he sold his birth to Jacob. Jacob was just an opportunistic just waiting there on the door. Then he tells the son, "My son, your father wants to bless Isa, but now my son, I want you now. I'm you can bring a a a lamp. I dress it for you the way your father likes and then you take to your father and he blesses you instead of Isaac was there waiting for But the mother was doing something different. Then Jacob said, "My mother, supposing my father discover that I'm not the one, I will be cast." No, it will be upon me only do what I'm going to do. So she finishes cooking, tells him, "You come." Then he puts the wool because body was hairy. And then after some time he comes, I'm your son. Yes, you've got the the kill very fast. You come here and I smell you. Then it touches him. He says, "Yeah, he smells the field. The border is my son." But the voices of Jacob said, "I'm the one." is a prophet and brother Brandham tells us that God does not show his prophets everything like Jacob the death of the saint telling him that Joseph is dead. God never revealed him anything until they came and told him that Joseph is in Egypt and then God told him you are going to touch his face. But all those years he never told him. So God had prepared the path we go through. Praise the name of our Lord. And that's the same thing that God works out in our lives that everything that comes to your life is ordained of God. Please find the goodness of God in the challenges that you face in the troubles that you go through. Lord, where is your path in this? Lord, what you desire me to do in this life? Praise the name of God. So then he says that predestination looks to destiny. So God had to prepare. Isaac should be blind. Despise this and this. And now when Isaac blessed Jacob not knowing and then his son came with the food the started trembling the father started trembling said what have I done said your brother's been here I'm the brother I'm the one said I've already blessed He said, "Isn't there another blessing left for me?" He said, "What is left for you? You're going to serve him because I've already blessed that you he's going to be ruler." And now Esau determined to kill Jacob in his heart. And the Bible says, "God revealed to Rebecca the heart of Esau. Then Rebecca told Jacob, "Run to my father." So God was preparing the path to go through. Then you look at the life of Jacob. When he goes to the well, Rachel comes with the animals, he helps her, then he goes to Laban's place. And then when he's there, after he had worked for a number of years, he says, "I want to get a wife. Because the mother told him you go and marry from her the daughters there and then the father tells him seven years. Praise the name of our lord. So is scripture. Praise the name of our lord. It is there. And you know when your time of marriage has come, you prove that your worth is the name of that you are worth to take somebody's daughter and you don't hate that family because of the charging people. They think I'm just going to work for them. You love the daughter. negotiate with them. Negotiate with them. Praise the name of So we are not going to preach that is unscriptural. Praise the name of our Lord. you know, of course, but if you choose to go where they pay, it's your choice. Praise the name of Yeah. So, you can't negotiate with them. He doesn't know what lies ahead. [laughter] You know that is scripture. &gt;&gt; But now I'm not saying you overcharge. Praise the name of our Lord. So now he had to work seven years. And when he worked seven years, the Bible says they seemed as a short time. Now you see the mind of God in the scriptures in the book of revelation. You know the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 11 that Abraham was looking for a city whose maker and builder. He kept on looking for the city. He knew the city is there. He kept on looking for it. But he didn't know. THAT THE FOUNDATION OF THAT CITY, praise the name of our Lord, and the gates of that city where the 12 patriarchs and the 12 apostles. He didn't know that &gt;&gt; because the Bible says that the foundation had the names of the apostles and the gates had the names of the tri 12 tribes of Israel. SO HOW COULD THAT CITY BECOME actual without the 12 tribes of Israel? So God had to harden the heart of Laban. Praise the name of our Lord. And when the time to give away came just put their layer. By the morning you realize this is not Rachel. Then preach his go and marry when the elder has not believe in those doctrines at home you know my elder sister let her first go then I will go no it should not be like that and so for another seven years He worked for Rachel. &gt;&gt; But the whole thing God wanted to get the 12 tribes of Israel for 14 years. The first seven years with Leia, no birth. When he gets Rachel, no birth. Then he opened the womb of Leia. She gives the first birth. But she's hated by the husband, gives the second birth, second, third. Then Rachel says, "Let me give my mate." So you find that Jacob had no interest to get more than one wife. Never the same mind of Abra Abraham. They never wanted. You see that even Isaac had a maid. Rebecca had a mate. But Isaac could not say, "Let me go to the maid." They were faithful to their voice. Praise the name of our Lord. They had a fear of God. So they have to live true to their commitment. So now when you look at the story OF JACOB, YOU SEE IT was ordained of God. When Rachel saw the sisters produce children, she told the husband, "Have my maid." He produced two children with the maid. Then Leia said, "Ah, even my maid is also here. no children. Now when God saw that there were 10 sons of Jacob, then he opened the womb of Rachel. He produced Joseph and there Jacob will not go to another woman. Then again another son and that was the end. Praise the name of our Lord. So he prepared his destiny, the things that Jacob had to go through to fulfill the mind of God. And that same thing also works in our lives. He prepares the path that we have to go through. And so it is by the grace of God. Praise the name of God that we are elected. Blessed be the name of our Lord. When you look at the story of Paul where he says here, &gt;&gt; let us go to the book of 2 Corinthians. I beg your pardon. Let us go to the book of second Corinthians. I think I never put it here. Praise the name of Let me just get it here in the scriptures where I wrote it. First Timothy, 1 Timothy then chapter one and then let us start reading from verse let me get the verse here. verse 10. Let us start to verse 11. &gt;&gt; The Bible says according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust. And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a Bmer a persecutor and injurous, but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. Now when you look at the the background of Apostle Paul, you would think this is a man God will never trust with anything. We killed people, we criticized, we arrested the churches, you know, being a witness at the death of Stevie. And then he says, "I was a blamemer, a persecutor, injurous." You know, he did everything he could to twist the church of Christ. And then he says, "I did all this in ignorance in unbelief, but the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. Praise the name of our Lord." So it is the grace of God. The abundant grace of God that he has shown us. It was the abundant grace OF GOD THAT GOD GAVE to Jacob. Not worth really. He was a suppler. That was his name. That was his nature. Even when he was in the womb, he was fighting. when he comes out doing the same thing wherever he was even now that affects even the Jews when you deal with them in business you must know that they are too smart it's a nature until somebody is born again so Jacob That WAS HIS NATURE. BUT THE LOVE OF GOD, THE GRACE OF God came down and then he wrestled with an angel. Praise the name of our Lord. So even Paul, praise the name of our Lord, when he had got authority from the chief priest, where he was going to persecute, the grace of God came down. And a bright shining light came and then called soul soul me Christ revealed himself to Paul and from that time he saw something totally different. And so even the elect lady we were in the denominations. Praise the name of our Lord. So some some of us were maybe alter boys. You know those boys who walk and when they reach their cathedrals they walk as if they are not offensive at all slowly. But what they do outside, there was a story, I think it was in Italy. &gt;&gt; And so now after this priest had given communion for just put full doors then started falling on the altar. You know, so some of us were in those kind of places, maybe in the choir, you're there singing in the choir. You're the one who escorts the priest. You did it in ignorance. But then a time came that your eyes were open. So even Paul with that kind of zeal Then he said, "I did it after the Jewish religion ignorantly." But now when Christ revealed himself and then he says, "The abundant grace of the Lord, down to me." And then he says in verse 15, "This is a faithful saying and worth of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief." He said, "I'm the chiefest of the sinners." He was recognizing the grace of God that came to save him. And we also need to recognize the grace of God that I'm whom I am not because of inability, but I am what I am. because of the grace of God. Praise the name of our Lord. How many started out and no longer standing? Who are you? Praise the name of our Lord. Who are you that GOD SO CARED ABOUT YOU that you were born from a believing family? That's a great privilege. It's a great protection that you were born FROM A FAMILY. MAYBE YOUR PARENTS, your father is not a drunker, your mother is not a prostitute. And they give you a good value, a good kind of character to. And then for you, it may also now be opposite. Your mother even can't tell you the father. But the grace of God comes and say, "Lord, I'm here. I've accept the Lord Jesus as my not looking AT YOUR PAST. HE NEVER looked at our backward. But his grace has made us to be the bride of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. It is something you look what I say in all my family. I'm the only person who has known this. It's election. It's the grace of God that Praise the name of Then he said, "How abide for this cause I obtained mercy that in me first Christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. Praise the name of our Lord. He said he chose me that he can express himself in my life. And the same thing God has chosen us that can express himself in our lives in your neighborhood at your place of work at your home among a strangers. Praise the name of the Lord. When the people revenge but for you is THE FEAR OF GOD in your life not going to do the way those people do. Praise the name of our Lord. is expressing himself in you. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message, the message of grace, he says that old prophet them eyes narrowed down. He said, David, surely you'll not die. Now we know the story. When the prophet Nathan went to David, when David had committed adultery and even killed and then the prophet told him a story, a parable and David immediately judged that man need to die. Then the prophet is telling him, David, surely you will not die. Watch grace then go to work right quick. The spirit struck the prophet saved David his life. Grace surely you will not die. But the sword will not leave your heart till it thoroughly ped your heart for you are not for you are that rich man. Oh, it was different then, wasn't it? What saved David when his own judgment said that man will die the utmost. He will pay for it with his life. And the prophet said, "Surely grace you will not die. You will not die. David, grace has saved you. It was grace to David that saved him. Praise the name of our Lord. It's always the grace of God. In everything we do, it's always the grace of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he said, if it hadn't been for grace, where would we be? Sovereign grace is from a sovereign one. Sovereign grace from a sovereign one. What can it do? Sovereign sovereign grace can do whatever it wants. Listen to this. Now sovereign grace can only be given by one that is sovereign. God is sovereign so he can give sovereign grace. Therefore, being sovereign grace, don't ask anybody. It doesn't do that. It does what it wants. Isn't that wonderful? You don't have to ask can I do this or shall I do this? Can I must I? Or doesn't it? It does itself sovereign. Therefore, he can save the vilest. He can save the worst. He can the impurest. He can save the immoral. He can heal the sick. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He can save a rich like me. He did. What is it? Grace. William Brham. William a drunkard son. That don't make any difference. The grace of God saved me. Praise the name of each and every one of us. It has been the grace of God. Amazing grace. How sweet is the sound. Praise the name of our save. The rich like me coming down to your levels. Maybe coming down in your gut. you know in those channels drunk and thrown down there grace picks you maybe in a prostitute's house just picks you there maybe in a gambling place just picks you there maybe Even they are wicked places. &gt;&gt; Wicked places. &gt;&gt; It takes you from that where you want to watch team after team after team after team all night. It saves you from there and then says no. You've lived a wasted years. Wasted years. Wasted years. Oh, how foolish. Now come and I'll make you somebody. Praise the name of our Lord. The grace of God coming down that can bring transformation. Praise the name of our Lord in our lives. He said it's only God who can do that. Me, I'm a woman's daughter. That was no good. That don't make any difference. The grace of God says it is sovereign. It has to ask nobody nothing. I'm so glad of that. Praise the name of can take the vilest sinner and make him as white as snow. You don't have to ask anybody about it. Sure. &gt;&gt; Like when you read the story of Paul, you know there was a prophet called Ananas and then he was praying and then the Lord showed him a vision. Arise Anas, go to that city under this in this house. Get one called Saul. You'll find him praying. HE SAID, "GOD, GOD, THAT MAN is dangerous. That one is terrible. He started reporting. Oh, you have wasted your charge. Even Steven, one of the deco, he was killed by that man. And the Lord was looking at. You know what he told? He is a chosen vessel unto me. Praise the name of sovereign grace. What did God do? took all what Saul has done and threw it in the soul forgetting the name of the Lord. And then he counted soul faithful to take what he was fighting and take it all over the world. Praise the name of God looked at his heart said, "Let me get this one." Praise the name of our Lord. Said, "Let me get this." And you see how the Lord the grace of God works. Paul with his zeal with HIS EDUCATION, ABILITY TO read and everything, God took him and said, "All this is now rubbish. All this is now dumb. This is the way I want to show you. Praise the name of the sovereign grace of God. So when God told it is a chosen vessel and Nanas's mind completely changed when he came to Saul and he laid his hands on him. He called him brother Saul. Praise the name of sovereign grace of God. How we need that grace. Praise the name of our Lord to continuously work in our life. He has chosen us. Praise the name of Lord to be the bride of Jesus Christ. And you must believe it for yourself. Don't believe a foolish virgin. I don't know if I will also make it. Believe you are that material. Praise the name of our Lord so you kind of pull away be in the middle of it. Praise the name of our Lord. IT'S THE GRACE OF GOD. Praise the name of our Lord. You know you must have that love of God. Say Lord here I am. Praise the name of our Lord. Now the Bible says in the book of Hebrews chapter 4, Hebrews chapter 4 and then verse 14. &gt;&gt; Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold first our profession. He said, "Behold it fast, your confession. I am the bride of Jesus. I am redeemed. I am saved. You're not looking at your abilities. You're not looking at your failures. You're not looking at your mistakes yesterday. You're not looking at the challenges ahead of you. But you are holding your confession. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he says, "For we have a high priest which cannot be touched which which we have not a high priest cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. But was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. SO THE BIBLE IS TELLING US let us come boldly &gt;&gt; not not saying I don't know whether you will answer me come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace in the time of need. Praise the name of Lord. So you come with boldness like Esther. &gt;&gt; The Lord was put. NOBODY should see the king until the king calls him. BUT NOW ESTHER CAME BEFORE THE throne boldly as the bride, as the queen came boldly. The Bible says he obtained favor. Even the bride of Jesus Christ have obtained favor before the Lord. So what is your challenge? What is your problem? What is your need? Praise the name of the Lord. MENTION IT BEFORE THE LORD. LORD, THIS IS my need. glor come with BOLD GLORY BEFORE THE THRONE of grace tell God this is myrration today like Esther she came AND THEN THE KING TOLD HER WHATEVER YOU will need even to the half of the KING AND THEN THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT WE ARE JOINT hairs we sit with Christ on the throne now if you can share with him with throne. What about your current need? HOW ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT IS TROUBLING YOU? WHY DON'T YOU BRING IT BEFORE THE LORD? LORD, THIS IS MY DESIRE. LORD, this is my need and our needs could keep on changing. Praise the name of our Lord. Our needs keep on changing like my brother Adonai. the need Lord if I can finish these functions when you go to him is prayer he's not praying about school fees &gt;&gt; for what now but there's a time he's going to pray for that praise the name that's what life is needed keep on changing if I'm renting Lord help me to pay. Now the month has started. Lord help me to pay rent. But then I get fed up of paying rent. Lord help me to build my house. When I build my house, how will I pray about rent? The needs keep on changing. Praise the name of the Lord. SO HE SAID WHATEVER need you have At any time you just say Lord this is my need. Praise the name of Lord. For me my need may be something different. To you it will be foolishness. This is my need. And then I pray about that. And the Lord is faithful to answer our needs. Praise the name of our Lord. So he says, "Let us come to the throne with boldness that we may obtain mercy to help us in the time of need. Praise the name of our Lord." Let us go to Psalms 103 as I try to wind up. Psalms 103:8. The Bible says, "The Lord is merciful and gracious. slow to anger and plenteous in mercy. Praise the name of the Lord. That's how should be in your mind. Don't allow the devil to put in you, God is too rough. God is against me. Don't allow negative thoughts in your mind. He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger forever. Verse 10. &gt;&gt; Verse n. He has not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. Praise the name of our Lord. So kind, so precious. So you come to him with boldness knowing that the Lord will sure help me out. The Lord will deliver me. The Lord will set me free from distress. The Lord will answer my prayers. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to first Peter chapter 2 and then verse 9. The scripture says, "But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should show forth the praise of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. which in the time past were not a people, but are now the people of God, which had not obtained mercy, but have now obtained mercy. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims obtained from fleshy lusts which war against the soul, having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify God in the day of visitation. Praise the name of our Lord. Hallelujah. So the Bible says we are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a pulia people. Praise the name of our Lord. We have been chosen by God that we should shine as light in this dark world as the elect lady grace. You are required by God to show his life, to show his praise, to show his character, the character of Jesus Christ. You know, wherever you are, let them know there goes a true Christian. Praise the name of Allah. Let be a testimony in your village. Let be a testimony at your school. Let be a testimony at your place of God. We are looking for a true Christian. We have one here. Praise the name of our Lord because we have been chosen. And as God has chosen us, he has given us grace. And grace means that he gives us the abilities. He helps us. He has given us the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit is the comforter. What does the comforter do? He aids you. You know, he helps you. He enables you when you are feeling weak. He comes and lifts you up. You know he's a help me. Praise the name of Allah and is always with us to help us in every condition we are in to help us in every situation we get in. The Bible say a very present help when you're in trouble. But it doesn't STOP AT THAT. ALL THE TIME IS WITH US. NOT ONLY IN TROUBLE, even in your good time, he's always there present. Praise the name of So then as God has chosen us as the elect, as the bride of Jesus, praise the name of our Lord, reflect the image of Jesus. Praise the name of our Lord because you are the manifestation of the word of God. Let that be seen. Praise the name of our Lord. Let it be seen at your place, Lord. Let it be seen in your home. Let it be seen in the neighborhood. Praise the name of our Lord. YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, WE know there's going to be a manifestation of the sons of God. Re Romans chapter 8. Many things are going to happen at that short time. But right now we have the life of Jesus Christ. Manifest that. LET THEM KNOW THERE is surely a man. There is surely a woman who live by the word of God. So you are showing his praise. YOU ARE SHOWING his marvelous life. You are showing the good works is working in your life. And all this is happening by the ability that God gives. Not because you fear the Lord, BUT THE LOVE of God. Put his word in you. What you desire, what you desire is to do the will of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Lord, I want to do your will. I have no other mind but your mind. Praise the name of Allah. WHILE THE OTHER VIRGINS, you know, THEY WERE ALL VIRGINS. THEY WERE ALL VERY BEAUTIFUL. But the king had to choose one. Praise the name of our Lord. One. And what did he choose? He chose the right attitude. What is our attitude towards God? What's attitude towards the word of God? Because that's what God will bless you. Bless your motive. Bless your attitude. When you think about God, what comes to your mind? Remember last Sunday how the Holy Spirit by the word of God divides the soul and the spirit to make them pure. Praise the name of our Lord. How is your life? How what do you think about Christ? When he asked them, what think ye of Christ? What do you think yourself of Christ? Praise the name of our Lord. We need to just desire Lord. He told me, "Let us be like Esther." &gt;&gt; Esther, &gt;&gt; she only obeyed whatever the king's chamber line told her. And we have the king's chamber line. You know, you know, you know, a unac doesn't have his own seat. &gt;&gt; So what is given and that's the messenger, the messenger of the age. The messengers of the age where the king is chamberling. So they had to tell the instructions of the king. And now this chamber line had the mind of the king. And then he started telling the virgin the king like this like this. But then there are those virgins who were coming for me. I'm going to show him. I have to show him the day. They have to show they have to see the way. They have to see the the V here. That was the others came. Different virgins. Pentecost and so that speaking in tong is what we preach and he's prophesying. Another one came just put aside. [laughter] Then another came just put aside. He was looking for the one with his mind. Then another one came walk. The king will not fall for that. But there one came with his character. Praise the name of her and say this is the one. The Bible says Esther obtained favor and as the bride of Christ we have also obtained favor in the midst of this evil world in the midst of this wicked world. Yet God gives us grace to overcome our temptation. It's just grace that you overcome this temptation. You overcome distress. You overcome this. Many things keep on coming. The way the Bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them. Every one of them. It is his grace. Praise the name of our Lord. Amazing grace. How the sound. May God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; As the song leader comes, let us sing that song. Amazing grace. Grace that has brought us this far. Amazing. Praise how sweet the sound that a rich like me.

Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; But 5:00 is already supper time. It's evening. Praise the name of our Lord. He did it in the evening. So let us stand up and take this scripture reading. Let us go to 1 Corinthians chapter 11. &gt;&gt; We are reading from verse 23. up to verse 29. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, this is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sapped, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord this death till he come. Wherefore soever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth of damination to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. Let us pray. Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, We appreciate for this opportunity Lord that you have given unto us to come again into your presence to observe the Lord's supper. That Lord, you started [music] that night before you were crucified and you did it the way did it before Abraham. Oh Lord, we are grateful [music] that we can come before your table and remember of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. [music] And you told us in your word that we [music] should do this as often as possible. And dear Lord, we have come not in our own, but we are believing the grace of God. that has saved every one of us. That that [music] same grace that released the blood on car even release the blood of Jesus Christ [music] to wash every one of us from all unrighteousness from all uncleanness. [music] None of us is worthy. But Lord, when we're in your blood, we are worthy. Lord, [music] we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, you may forgive every one of us all our sins and trespasses, [music] of anything that is contrary to contrary thoughts or imaginations, desires, Lord, may the blood of Jesus wash every one of us, Lord, and make us all heavenly. for your mother and your heavenly father. Now you went about healing the lepers which represented sin. And now we have the blood of Jesus [music] that shall never lose its power till the last one is redeemed to sin. We pray may bless us father as we partake of the Lord this summer. [music] Lord, we also pray in the name of Jesus that you may sanctify this unleavened bread that father you will make it worthy to serve the occasion of remembering you Lord. Even [music] as we eat of it, may we get the benefits heavenly father and all the promises of God. As you said, heavenly father by your prophet, [music] but that Abraham when he ate of this unleavened bread, he was able to walk the journey [music] stronger and healthier in our midst. And Lord, as they partake [music] of this bread, let them be And Lord [music] bless every one of us that all our hearts desires may be even the bottle of wine [music] that we shall be taking after the breaking of bread. Bless the wine fun that may serve the purpose of God. Oh God, as you called us to do, bless us all together as we wait upon you and as we meditate upon this [music] in the name of Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. [music] I would call brother Dan and brother Joshua to come [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music]
