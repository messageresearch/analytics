amen God is good he didn't you know wait for us to choose him but he chose us he will be responsible for every step of your way amen amen so today we want to have two Services just on something special amen your marriage how many people are married herey there are quite a number of you okay there is something we are dealing with here that will help our marriage in the morning and also in the evening so I greet all the ministers in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ thank you for being able to come those of you have been able to come you left your church back home to come and be with us and the Lord bless you for that amen this is very important for you as ministers because you need it as your people need it amen let's just stand up and get into the scripture reading we don't have enough time today not enough time in the morning are not even enough time in the evening God bless you brother amen for accepting to be here with us this morning amen so we shall go into First Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 7 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man may the Lord had blessing the reading of his word you may be seated so I have a subject today she is the glory of the husband amen so any married sisters here you add the glory of your husband and this is what I want to emphasize this morning and I want to take you know from Genesis so that we can systematically go with this thought amen we know very well that life began in life amen because he is the life himself he existed alone when there was nothing like an angel there were no atoms there was no gas but he existed by himself the self existent one and the Hebrews called him Elohim El Elohim means the one who exists by himself then that invisible Spirit took a the body called the logos the word body that way he was stepping into form because asoh him he did not have the form he was an invisible spirit that existed by himself there was nobody who would look into who he was so he existed without a form but then he took a form of a body and this form here was a form of a light a body of light but then he retained the same power the same glory and the same Authority so he just proceeded from invisibility to a body of light called the logos and that's the same body that Saul met when he was on his way to Damascus to continue persecuting the Christians there is something that brother Bram says here he says and in the evening when the sun was going down and they went to the cathedral under the palm trees whatever trees it was in Eden and they began to worship and a soft M [Music] light God the logos came down over the top of the trees and he said children have you enjoyed yourself today on the earth God was coming down to Adam and Eve as a soft glowing light and then he would speak to them about how they spent the day did you enjoy the day and then they would say yes we had a very wonderful day we went down into the we had sought out that mountain we brought this Mountain from here to there you see we just organized the Earth according to the way it would really be nice for us because he was an God God had given him a kingdom where he could exercise God's Authority on us and then God would say ni okay have a good night that was God and man so God if we can see it this way he formed himself into Supernatural [Applause] light and then spoke a natural light let there be light he had formed himself a body of life a supernatural and in that body he said let there be life and when John speaks about him as light he calls him the True Light which means is different from this solar light the lunar light the natural light is totally different from those light therefore he calls him a True Light he such a light that when he steps into the natural light the natural light turns into darkness because that's what happens when Saul was on his way to Damascus when that great light the person of the Lord Jesus Christ came down to meet sa this natural light which you know sa would use to see it became Darkness oh praise the Lord so in the beginning Elohim stepped into that Supernatural body of life and he started to create he created the vegetation he created the sea life he created the birs of the air he created the animals of the field and finally created Man In His Image man was the Capstone of his creation but I want you to see what the Bible says about that man in Genesis chter 5 and verse one he says this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God him now what was the likeness of God God was a great light Supernatural and God created Adam in the same image then he says in verse two male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when he when they were created so Man created in the image of God and the likeness of God Amen so that you know there was a mystery in this man and the Mystery was that there was a woman on the side of it are you together with me so what does that mean it means that since God created man in his own image and therefore man had a mystery bride in him even God from before the foundation of the world he had a bride in him is that amen yeah he didn't find me now I was in him before the foundation of the world and when he created Adam he was representing the idea of what he was and the Bible says when he created I mean male and female he cre he called their name Adam meaning that a bride shares in the name of the man are you together with me he called their name meaning that she shares of his name meaning that she is part of him and the name means the character are you together with me that when Eve would proceed from Adam then that thing would be seen except the nature of Adam in this woman are you together with me so now let us say we also share in the likeness of the nature of God so Adam could not function to his full function I mean to to the fullness when Eve was not made manifest there was something there that needed to be made manifest so that Adam could fully function are you together with me yes sir now a real Christian man cannot really Excel to his limits unless something special happens that he finds a help meat are you together with me Adam could not function to his fullness there are certain things he could not do until this woman was made manifest because she comes to manifestation to become a help me Amen to become somebody to support him [Applause] so there are certain limits that Adam could not attain to are you together with me I want to tell you men that there are certain limits that you cannot attend to without your wife there are certain things that your wife is supposed to help you out amen so the process of marriage was made like a work of art that could hang in the Hall of critics to be criticized to be proved before it could be hang out in the Hall of [Applause] Faith amen praise the Lord now let me say this it's like those people who make a craft on the streets they put this you know uh craft so that they can criticize it this head is Big let me trim it this hand here is not proportional to the body let me do this amen and marriage the we came it was like a god allowed this process to be taken in a hall of critics so that it can be proved before it could be brought before realization God had to watch Adam and then he sees Adam he says there are certain limits he cannot attain to I want to tell the young man here that there are certain I mean Heights you cannot attain to unless you are married you cannot reproduce yourself unless you are married you cannot practice fatherhood without a marriage there are certain Heights you cannot attain so God put Adam there so that he can develop a mind and then God would prove him and then he says it's not good for a man to stay alone Amen brother it's not good for a man to stay alone amen So Adam had to prove that he had developed his mind and therefore God would allow the mystery of the Bride to be made manifest amen so marriage therefore exposes and our levels of maturity because a mature man is known by the way he relates to his wife that's very important there marriage will expose the love of your thinking it will expose the love of your Administration Expos the of your patience and that's why the Bible attaches to the ministry attaches the ministry to the success of a man's marriage because this man by way of marriage the of his PES by his marriage he's expressing the way of his Thinking by his marriage he's expressing the ability of management of a community and that's why the Bible attaches the ministry to the success of the man is marriage let's go to First Timothy chter 3 and verse he says a bishop V must be blameless the husband of one wife sober of good behavior given to hospitality and a to teach not given to Wine no Striker not g of fer but patient not a not one that ruleth well his house having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man know not how true his how shall he take care of the Church of God there are certain things you cannot attend to unless you are married so the points to Mark here a bishop must be married to one wife he rules this family well by the word not by what he thinks but by the word having children in subjection then for one to pass the test of the Bishop one must be seen living with his wife as one body you see there are many people who love their [Music] bodies they'll wash them they'll care for them they eat very well you see what I mean they love their body you cannot separate from their body some of these people go to some kind of a shop and he look at every suit because he loves his body he'll get the best suit because he loves his body he looks at the color of his skin and then the color of the suit it takes about an hour to choose the right one do you know why because he loves his body you see what I mean so a bishop a pastor must be a man who knows how to dwell with his wife as one body are you together with me loves it nourishes it amen and then he comes down here in first Timothy 310 and let those also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless amen Deon is now here even so must their wives be great not slanderers faithful in all th let the deons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own house as well no I'm saying that there are certain areas of life a man cannot attend to because the only way he can get to them as if he has been tested in the field of his marriage that's why a bishop meaning a pastor cannot be a woman because the Bible says must be a man of one wife there cannot be a deacon because even a deacon must be a husband of one wife and also tested before he set out to work so all these scriptures show that a wife is a very strong determinant in accessing a church off because your marriage will expose your levels of maturity if you married for convenience it will be exposed if you Mar a wife for a cook in the house it will be exposed but if you married a wife because you want to take the type of Christ and the church it will also be exposed amen hallelujah hallelujah so marriage exposes your levels of respect Amen to see how you respect your wife to see whether you pass to become a person who will be able to respect the church if you became a pastor you she a training ground marriage exposes your level of patience amen and CED with the children we shall see the level of your administration of the community so in First Peter 3 verse 1 listen to what Peter says here likewise you wi be in subjection to your own husband now the Bible doesn't say be in subjection to all men no he says be in subjection to your own husband you don't go to a man's house is uh her husband is not there and then you say she didn't cook for me a cup of tea women be in subjection to your own husband that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be one by the conversation of their wives so now wives are called to subjection so a wife should not compete for the headship of the home because that position is not H that position is given to the man but the men having that position should not abuse their leadership because your headship is channeled through one channel and that's the channel of love are you together with me your headship works by love if you tell me there is a family violence in this house we are given only two things we are given love and submission there is no woman that will hurt you for loving her I loved my wife so much until she hated me there must be something else are you together with me love and submission so what do the sister submit to the sister submits to your love the more you love her is the more she's going to subit sisters are you there amen so in verse seven he says likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge meaning that the first time God allowed Adam to have a wife he had to test his level of understanding first then he says it's not good such a man to alone because he has passed the test he has the mind of God to dwell with a wife with understanding it's not just keep them in the house but dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the we as a man you are mular you got big Muses but she's a weaker vess you got a muline spirit but she's got a tender feminine Spirit you cannot dwell with your wife like you are dwelling with a man in your house the Bible says You must realize she's a weaker [Applause] vess and while you are dealing with in the house you must know that both of you you are ha to the grace of life so as far as God is concerned he has put two children together saved by the same Grace talking to the same God In Prayer but this one here is looking to you to love her because it began from you will you marry me didn't we hear the song It Started from you so you must keep that standard love her thank you she's a tender timid spirit and must be handled as so and once you Hur her confidence sometimes it's very hard to repair it you see when my daughter just married I went to visit them and then you know I found her alone in the house and I told her you leave our country and you go to this far country to a man whom you don't know and she said it was a revelation she loves you she has trusted her life to you you must treat that life right they called little Rea and they said Becca will you go with this man and she says I will go her mind was way out for Isaac they made a party and poor girl went where was she going she was going to a kingdom she was going to meet her husband the woman sells you all her trust you need to love them so in verse eight he say finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be cous those are things that you must make sure you exercise in your house to be of one mind to have compassion one for another so seek to be of the same mind with your wife because basically you are one body and going back to the beginning your wife was your Revelation are you together with me because here is Adam he has been put to sleep and now you know a re is moved and the wife is M when he comes out of sleep he sees this woman here and he says hey you are Flesh of My Flesh you are born of my born you shall be called woman because you came out of the M who told Adam it was his Revelation who told you to marry that your own you must love [Applause] amen amen amen then he says not rendering evil for evil you are not a man when you say I beat her because she did this no the Bible says not rendering evil for evil or rendering I mean raing for raing amen knowing that you are there that you should inherit a blessing amen so a marriage relationship must be free of Revenge I'm I'm I'm waiting for for her when she does this I'll do it to her also and when she says this I say don't you remember you are not a man you are not a man because we are talking about husband and wife and I want you to look at Christ and his church you mishandle her Christ he says for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain from Evil and his lips that they speak in or G so here the the the Bible is teaching family order by giving the husband and the wife guidelines when you come to church you subject to a church order when you get married you subject yourself to family order that you must not break don't be bitter to one another and as a Son of God cannot fail to keep his wife happy regardless of what challenges they are going through you have got the ability to keep your wife up let me show you something here you know some people ISB when get M Bey if you are not able to be happy with your wife and your husband in time of poverty even when you get the money that joy and peace will not be there and it even become worse I'll give you you an example in the message choosing a bride brother Bram brings before us two couples the rich and the poor and he wedlocked both of them so he goes back to check on them okay so and then one day he says I thought I would go down and visit this Rich couple and then he tells us something about them he says that they don't have to work their fathers were millionaires had had given them a nice home they didn't have to work they had a nice CAD which was given to them every year they were given a new CAD and only children and they had just everything they wanted and I went there got their little clothes and I had them and they were really fasing rich they don't have to work wake up in the morning make these eggs and sausage and then ride in the their CAD brand new driven for 12 months they given another one but they were jealousy of one another they had gone to a dance and you know this girl was really beautiful and she was kind of those beauty queen I'm telling the young man now marriage is not [Applause] praise the Lord and I looked at them and one was sitting in one corner the other was SE in the other Corner fing about a certain boy and the cring of another girl because they had been in at night club and this boy danc with the girl and this man danced with you know and so they were fasty so then I went slowly and as he got into the house they jumped to one another oh brother BR how are you doing it's nice to see you here hiding their situations I'm a pastor I know how to read people you get to a home and you know where there's true love you see if I get to a home and the man is saying something has to look to the wife to affirm but if there's true love the man does not have to say you must say yes you know you get to the house there and you can see whether is a genuine smile whether the smile is fake you see what I mean yeah I'm a pastor I read people you get into a house and the conversation flows but you get into a house you are trying to say certain things and the wife has to force to join the conversation you know you know when there is peace in the house you just look at the wife when there is no peace in the house you look at the house you know wives women they emotional they can't hide their emotions that's how God made them when they are not happy they are not happy you cannot force it on them just look at the woman that's the woman that's the church brother Bram says you want to see the level of the church look at the women in the church they are the reflection of the life of that church that's how God made a woman amen so he says he then went and visited the old I mean the poor couple they had a little old children amen and uh I slipped around so I could look through the crack you we the door being shoved open amen and there he was sitting in there and her on his lap and his hand around her and arm around him and he pulled out the paycheck he was laying it on the table say so much for groceries so much insurance and so much for the car and they couldn't make their ends meat you see come to find out he had seen a little dress up there in the window which he has been looking at for a couple of weeks and then he went and bought it and he says well honey you could look so pretty in this she said but honey I don't really need it it's not wealth that makes a home it's not wealth that makes a home because the scripture tells us a man's life consist not in the abundance of the things which he possesses amen there must be a life on the inside when the man has the love of Christ automatically the woman will produce the submission of the church so the scriptures instruct you on how to love her and keep her happy the scripture say husbands love your wives as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for [Applause] it when you go back from here just go and tell your wife honey I love you how many will do that husband okay somebody is lucky just go and tell I love you that's a CH amen let's go to Ephesians 5 verse 28 brother Fred that's good news let's go to ephes 528 so out men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loves himself because in the beginning he called their name Adam the wife was a mystery in this man here so they were one body but why did God allow this woman here to be BR Revelation it was because she was supposed to be the glory of the man are you together with me okay let's go a little further first for no man ever yet HED his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes even as the Lord the church so the word demands that you love her that you nourish her that you cherish her do three things love her nourish her cherish her to nourish is to nurture with nut trents and to change is to keep is to keep one Spirit warm amen by attend care and this is a culture that must be cultivated from day today in our marriages now let me tell you one thing we are supposed to stay together with these sister not until one day until two death till death death amen so if you are going to sit together I'll tell you one thing I went to a house somewhere in Tu Arizona and I found [Music] this you know the skin pulled off and put on some kind of uh uh a craft sort of whatever I can call it so it was put in the sitting room and I said oh you've got Takis here and brother M told me yes yeah there are so many in the wild I said no in Uganda these are birs we find in our homes he says in America they in the wild I didn't know that so he put on a tap for me to show me how they hunt tury these tur fly in the air up there in America and the people go and hunt them what am I saying here that for you to stay with something wild you have to tame it but I want to tell you one thing your wife is not something to [Music] tame yes you are not going to do that your wife we've been only told to do one thing love her love will tame your wife amen a wife is not a wild animal that has to be domesticated or Tamed the Bible just says nourish her cherish her These Are Spiritual standards you don't break your wife like you are breaking a wild hor ride it amen because you don't just come and climb the back of a horse it will and throw you off there are certain things you do to break that horse but that's not your wife your wife is not a wild horse marriage is not r on your terms it's both of you fting in Ephesians [Applause] 5 husbands wife's sub the husband's love here is not an addictionary this dictionary description where you go to Google and you are looking for love you see these days marriages are not run by the word it's run by Google I'll go and Google about how to tame your wife no you don't have to go to Google we've got the instructions out of the word God Amen it's a scriptural translation so this love is the nature of Christ in the man hallelujah hallelujah if you don't have Christ in you there's no way you can have the love to love your wife because the love you give to your wife is the nature of Christ himself it must be expressed to the wife and it's not how much supplies you finish in the house amen because some people say me I bring food at home me I bring out the clothes me I do this that's not what it is amen she didn't come to marry your food she came to Mar there is more [Applause] to it's more than that it must go with passion she did not marry your Mary she's married to your love the woman in Genesis chapter 3 he told her thy desire shall be after your husband Hallelujah your desire shall be after your husband so men don't begin to [Music] complain after 530 after 5:30 I've just closed office she's saying honey how are you now these are the complains that come to the pastor I don't have peace she's giving me calls calls calls the Bible says her desire will be after you she has just been waiting 5:00 her heart boom to you

of how spiritual she is she'll kick back when her position is threatened she'll kick back doesn't matter how spiritual she is she will kick you see it doesn't matter how spiritual she is can I tell you about one woman very spiritual she kicked back her name is Sarah with the deep mean the deepest of respect to Abraham always calling him Lord she kicked back and she said cast out to this born woman and son for the son of this born woman shall not be with my son even ISAC she's kicking back amen Abram stood his ground but God took s with and God will always stand with sah in your stupid games a strange woman God will stand with s of the time and God said unto Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the [Applause] L because of th B woman all that s has said how canot have voice in Isaac shall thy seed be called oh man God will always stand on the side of your [Applause] wife are you together with me let's look at Adam's marriage now now for Adam to marry the mind of the father had to be proved first and that's the mind that loves God says you know when he created he created two things come together husband wife husband wife husb but for the sake of being united and being one when he created ad he hid the wife in him and he called them their name Adam they share the name they share the character they share the flesh they share the B they share the spirit and then God he says for me to release this woman let me check out the mind of so he brings the animals to see what Adam would call and the scripture says whatever Adam called that was the name there not that Adam named the animals but that Adam got into the mind of God and knew every animal that passed by him he had the mind of God immediately after that he says it's not good for such a man who has my mind alone a man like this one who thinks like a God can forgive like a God can reconcile like a god no no no no no no no it's not good for him to D Hallelujah Hallelujah to the men that are here this morning it's not good for you to dwell alone and God gives you a wife because you have got the mind of God to lead her you don't lead her because you are a boss you don't lead her by your mind you lead up by the mind of God when you mature to the mind of God then that's the moment that God is going to release Your Glory that's the mind that loves a [Applause] wife that love that we should love our wife's by is God's Own Divine mind a man who has not studied the word cannot be able to love his wife you must study the word to get the mind of God listen to the test to get the mind of God that where you are going to be able to love your wife let this mind be you which was also in Christ Jesus and the nature of this man is described in the verses which you know follows the Philippians 2 because Jesus condescended to the level of his Bri praise God Amen while he was godone he condescended and came to the level of his brother what she suffered he also suffered he learned obedience by the things he suffer don't call your wife a fool she will ask you very stupid things because she doesn't know but because you are a husband you come down to her level he condescended to the love of his Bri in practice he acted as a man but yet he was God husband learn to condent to the Lev of your wife if she's not educated you are the one who went for her you stay you mustc to to redeem the bride he had to become king with her you need to develop and maintain a keen relationship in order to maintain the marriage bond it's about handling her as a wicker vessel it's dwelling with her with understanding she's not a ml Spirit like you yet she is the glory of the [Applause] husband hallelujah hallelujah so was well neded once welled amen she produces the character of The Bible bride she becomes the glory of the man she portrays you as a man of character she portrays as a man of character a man who has been able to lift his wife to such a respectable level amen she portrays you to the level that you can even stand in church as a deacon you can as well stand in church as a pastor because you have been able Amen to pass through the Gat of leadership that's managing your wife we are two two different Natures of spirit a woman has the feminine Spirit and the man is mass and God deals with a man as a man and deals with a woman as a woman you as a man should learn how to deal with your wife the same way God deals with the church he's not rough to the church he loves the church listen God we are getting into the title now she is the glory of the husband listen he made him in his own image that's Adam and God is a spirit so when he separated him and put him in flesh he put the muline spirit in a man body and The Feminine spirit in a woman body those two bodies are different they act different and they even dress different and even God put a law that a man should not put on that which belongs to a woman different structures and a man must behave as a man you are not a man when you start kind of bleaching yourself because you want to look like a woman and then you start walking like you are a woman you are not a man you must prove that you have a m Spirit he made the muline spirit to overwhelm the feminine spirit with Redemptive [Applause] love amen so that she could have a strong arm to fall into Hallelujah that's why you are a sickly not bump her but that you may be the strong arm that your wife will fall into amen you cannot keep your wife by blaming in and out practice a Redemptive love towards your wife and that's what Adam did he stepped down to her level in order to redeem her oh Hallelujah he had to walk away from the and let me go and redeem her he knew what it meant but he had to get her back you must be able to have a Redemptive love for your praise the Lord amen love doesn't dump your wife into situation love does not threaten your wife I will divorce you rest us am your wife should not craw for your love you are her Redeemer amen you cannot make your wife to become a beg of your life you must always remind her for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten I'm going to give everything I have to keep loving you hu your wife should not be a love beggar it's something that would should flow automatically towards her we must not reverse the principles here because if we do that's where marriages failed love her the same way you love your body that love for your body is inseparable it is inseparable sometimes you are trying to walk and then your foot you know triples and you fall and then you see the head is Hur you don't get a hammer to discipline the to member of your body would be sorry that the toall has stumbled you love your body you are one body with your wife she's your glory just as you are one with your body you must be one with your wife she born of your born flesh of your flesh she's your glory and if she fails in certain areas just n her and cherish her all that she's doing you know you start saying I don't know what's wrong with this woman she's trying to appeal to the hidden elements your love is hidden so she tries to do certain things to reach your concern don't blame her for crying don't call her a child that's the way God made amen amen women will always communicate by emotions if you are not a man you'll hate those emotions but when you are a man you know somebody is appealing to me respect her tears she's a weak she's a woman if you are a man you start crying there is a problem with you you don't have a m [Applause] SP the Bible says dwell with her with understanding you must know their nature and their character Let's Just DE a little bit with the father condition God gives the man an opportunity to play two parts the part of the bridegroom and the part of Father the wife has only one part to play the part of the Bride the children have only one part but the husband has been given two parts he has a part to play as a husband amen the bridegroom and a part to play as father so manhood is about expression of love and also to be a guide to love your wife and then guide your children you don't become a father and you have children and you are totally useless to the crop that God has given you you are not putting them in the word you are not instructing them they are just grow listen Ephesians chapter 6 verse one says children obey your parents in the Lord for it is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with the promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth now parents use these scriptures to pull children into obedience but they are trying to reap where they did not s just like a man demanding submission from a woman he doesn't it doesn't work you see what I mean verse four says and you fathers provoke not your children Trust but bring them up in the natur and admonition of the Lord the scriptures expect the father to be a s of good seed in both friends and the wife by loving her and in the children by becoming their [Applause] gu amen God wants you to express both attributes play the part of the bridegroom and play the part of father when we are redeemed God plays both attributes in our lives he is our bridegroom as he is our [Applause] father amen so when the man CED was facing the final hours of his ministry on Earth Christ was facing the final hours of his Min he started viewing himself as the Lamb of God shifting from a a a teaching Prophet to enter into the attribute of the sacrifice from the son of man to the Son of God was near him and he needed his father by his side because he feared are you here with me you see now I'm trying to bring out something here to show you what a father is I've shown you what a bridegroom is but you need to know that the father is The Giver of comfort the cross was near him and he needed his father because he feared Hebrews chapter 5 verse 7 he says who in the days of his flesh when he offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears him that was able to save him from death and he was heard in that he feared Jesus yes here reveals the Reliance of the son to the father a father must be present in the lives of his children he must be present because the moments come when the children fear they want to touch the concern of the father you must turn true to the two attributes that God is you have been given your wife to lead her by the mind of God and your children to play fatherhood too amen now listen in Mark 14 verse4 and says unto them this is the son now is now not son of man anymore a teaching prophet he phasing into the Son of God a sacrifice a redeemer the work of priesthood he says unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful after death tell he and watch and went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him and he said father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will but Thou Art wi so the lamb was bleeding in the garden of GE in that last hour he was a son pleading to the father because he feared you see how God changes his offices at one time he's a bridegroom at another time he's a father and as a man at one time you are a husband at another time you are a wife I mean you are a father are you together with me to fulfill both attributes that Christ plays in as bridegroom and father father all things are possible unto thee father that he could run to and cry father your children need you how we need to be a present father they need to see you first to first when they come to the crossroads of Life the scripture advises you to be a friend to your children he says don't provoke them playing both attributes bridegroom father praise the Lord just turn around and tell your friend I have to be a father to my children be a father be a husband to your wife amen sunship needs leadership I'll take you to Romans 8 verse 14 we want to finish up the first service soon and make sure we get into the second service amen amen he says in Romans 8:14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of godship needs leadership you don't give birth to children and just keep feeding them you must be giving them the best food taking them to the best schools but they need your leadership for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB father you remove the negative person from yourself and put on the love of God that could receive a sin in love that's what you need so that you can play the part of a father don't provoke your children amen don't impart the spirit of fear upon them even when they have done something wrong for God so loved the world bring them close to you and become a leader of your children when God gave us the spirit of adoption Hallelujah the spirit of adoption means the spirit that guides us to adoption but before we get here we have made many mistakes from here to get to there but he gave us the spirit to bear with us to encourage to teach us to rebuke us until he brings us here that's the work of a [Applause] father when God gave us the spirit of adoption he was not looking at the spot where he gave us the spirit of adoption he was giving us the guide to take us to the adoption are you together with me praise the Lord start a work that will not be a short one to Tender your children a man who serves well in both these attributes the Bible says can either be a minister if able to teach or a Deon because he has passed in the office listen I'll take you to this message leadership so that you can understand this very well the first is a mother's kindness then the father's word she's a kind mother but then the father's well and then you see this person who doesn't understand these things when I them mother but the word of the father are you together with me okay after the mother gives your first step then you look to your daddy all of us for wisdom because he the head of the house from the mother bringing you up to show you love of a parent then you go to the father for the word of wisdom how much do we know that can help our children as a Word of Wisdom what do we have stay in the word study the word because we equipping yourself to be able to help your family grow amen and he not that he's any smart but he's just made a leader of his family so we follow what our dadd says do when he says now son I would like for you to do a certain certain thing then we listen to him because it's wisdom but listen he has learned a whole lot and we go to ask him to see what he learned and then we can profit by his what he has learned a student and the Bible says I refused for a woman to speak in church if there is anything she wants to learn let her ask her husband at home but today we have even husbands who cannot explain the [Music] godhead the say that [Music] you choose your lack of time to study let me advise your sister from here go and ask your husband some of the things we've studed challenge him let him go to the book because he's supposed to be a father are you together with me show me father that has the mind of Christ by the word and I'll show you the man who has played both these attributes brother Bram preaching the message Elisha was in a discernment line and then turned to a man all of a sudden whose family was breaking up but you find that situation had a play of the spirit world to it the devil will not allow you to play bridegroom and father without a fight let me take you here in the message the prophet elishah he says how do you do all of a sudden he's turning to this man he's asking him how do you do do you believe me to be the servant of God many many other servants are here but I am his servant immediately there is a spirit pulling from this young man this boy is in trouble he's in trouble deeply in trouble the boy is suffering with a mental disorder you have just come from an institution and I see them giving you some kind of a a shock treatment they've given you shock treatment and you have an phobia that's it you see a face before you all the time and it's it's your mother's face that you see you are a married man you have a wife and two children brother Bram is in a discernment L amen so there is a spiritual at play in the breaking of this marriage the first of a mother always stood before this boy whatever the first spoke to him we don't know but maybe to this boy the mother's qualities were the qualities of the best wife and he's not seeing them in him so he said there is a face that keeps standing before you oh it's the first of your mother and brother Bram is dealing with a marriage trouble and there are some men here to them a true wife is the character and nature of their mother they've not gone into the world to study the lives of the Holy Women he's looking like this my mother she used to do like this my mother at that time she do like this and the sisters would get tired hearing mama Mama brother said there is a first standing before you he was a he was a mama's boy and the mother has not died out of his face instead of putting his wife into the images of ho Bible women he wanted to keep seeing his mother in the life of his wife everything my mother my mother told my mother and the Bible says for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother to be joined to his wife and they too shall be one Bo are you together with me we continue with the quot Jesus Christ that come along and delivered the man in Gad is here tonight to deliver you from this and take that fobia from you theia was the first of a mother and drive the devil from you that you can return to your home well do you believe that do you believe that he sent me to do this for you you would you know would you bow your head and be reverent this is very treacherous and dangerous keep your head bow till you hear my voice say raise your head come here young man before this before I ask this blessing I'm going to ask you something will you obey me as his servant and do as I tell you to do you are going to get well the time of Deliverance is at this time this is a devil doing this young man he would drive you stuck mad keep you that way the rest of your life but God can restore you in your right mind and right mental conditions I see another thing you been to a psychiatrist trying to talk to you that's not the idea it takes more than that that for you it it takes the power of the Living God you understand me if you don't you will in a moment bow your head in reverence then he says Heavenly Father this young man standing here fin looking young fellow standing here in the stat of a Young Manhood and Satan has come to him to tear his home break up his family and drive this young man out into the wild once the fatherhood is broken the family is torn and the tearing of the family comes with a permanent Cloud over the family depression set sin over the father over the mother and over the children so we ministers we are not gifted like brother Bram to look under family situations and then tell it like he could but the only thing that tears down a family is a spirit world it's a spirit love love and submission does not break a family we enter into this institution with love and submission the prophet continues to pray but your God who made the heavens and the Earth who created all things through Christ Jesus I come as your servant in prayer of faith for this young man knowing that just now he can't have faith for himself because of his condition his mind had been blackened by a progressive Dark Cloud it has taken years maybe because they already have children they couldn't even get back to the Genesis they don't know where it started from but it's a progressive Cloud then he says Lord here the pray of your servant Satan is haunting at him and making his life misery but the Lord Jesus that set the maniac free that was Far Beyond this boy you can make this boy well tonight the prophet is dealing with this condition as a sickness are you together with me as a sickness so we step into the family to deal with their situations but the roots already planted and they are so deep and some of them are unique we need to rescue our [Applause] marriages the prophet you know he had the ability to see but for me God has just given me the word a normal Christian would not like to break the image that connects him to the nature of God Amen to be a bridegroom and to be a father the prophet continues and Satan you who bound him you kept the psychist hallelujah amen they got the psychist but the prophet is saying the devil has escaped those ones you've escaped the medical treatment he says but you cannot escape the power of God come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ go from him the thing wild passed out of the boy going in that direction are you seeing there spirit are responsible for breaking of families the prophet says the fers W coming out of that Bo so for any standing family is God for any breaking family it is for any standing family it is God and for any breaking family it's a spirit it's a spirit so on the side there could be a beautiful lady maybe who playing that jokes around you and when you nurse those jokes they tamper with the image of a man him being a bridegroom and him being a father it tempers let's go back identify the subject and we finish First Corinthians 11 verse 7 where we read for a man indeed not to cover his head for as much as the image and the glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man so there are two glories we are dealing with here the glory of God in the man and the glory of the man in the woman two things here so what's the glory of God in the man so when God speaks about the Bible man being the image and the glory of God is speaking about us like in the pr of Abraham who was the father of Nations even before he had seen Isaac adoption is the potential that every Son of God must have and must progressively grow into okay so second Corinthians 3:18 he says but we all with open f beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from Glory to Glory even as the spirit of the Lord did you hear that so behold That Glory behold that glory and start walking into it progress get into the word and know what that glory is the man born again is in the glory of God Amen just like Adam was supposed to display the nature of God to Creation Adam was the glory of God presented before the animals so when Adam stood all nature stood with him and when he fell all and up to now is GR amen we want to see the first man the man before he fell in s Hallelujah Hall we want to see him he was the glory of God before all nature and so you as a man you are the foundation of your family when you stand the family will start you fall the family will fall Romans 819 he says for the honest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope so all creation is waiting for man to be restored into the glory of God the Redemption of all nature lies in man restoring back into the glory of God okay so nature was subject to man in the glory of God and the success form also is subject to a man in the glory of God and when a man falls in those principles the subject suffer okay the wife suffers the kids suffer because the man has failed to find his position so there is no Son of God who understands himself to be so to be the strong Foundation that the fames built upon that would watch a crack coming into his life and does not care to breach it where is my weakness as a bridegroom and as a father I know you know but any Son of God who sees that crack will seal it he will repair the cracks he got God and cried to God for his family amen that man will enter Isaiah 58 and spend his time in prayer and fasting to become the repair of the bridge the repair of the paths to dwell in because they shall be of the you know because they that be of thee shall build the old west places sh up the foundation of many generations when you realize your weaknesses and your failures and you going prayer and fasting then you become the repairer amen of the bridge and the restor of the part of your family amen because those who come out of you shall build the worst places and you shall raise up the foundation of many generation the whole creation is for fathers like that when a man falls from that position I don't mean by drinking or by adultery but rather when he fails from upholding those principles everything around him Falls with him when Adam fell amen everything fell with in divorce a Son of God can never think about divor because in divorce family scatters the joys flee your prayers will hit a Breen scy amen so your glory and there will be a dark cloud that will permanently go around with you the streets will Point At You the wonderful father a man is the glory of God and your wife needs to best That Glory so that she can shine you are the Sun and she's the moon she needs some Glory from the husband to this place Amen brother Bram says when God made the heavens and the Earth he made the moon to shine in the obsess of the sun to give light while the sun was gone a beautiful type of Christ and the church the church is the Moon to give the glory to the world while the son is God so what I mean a lesser light amen and then otherwise the moon and the sun is husband and wife as Christ and the church his husband and wife the wife being the weak of Vel only gives a smaller light in the absence of the husband and the church can only make manifestation of the Holy Spirit and remember the moon cannot give any light of and when you see the Moonlight it's not the Moonlight it's the reflection of the sunlight and Christ ascends up is that right and shines his light on the church to reflect the light and the power of the church in his absence amen so the moon broadcast the light of the you must give her you must give your wife a certain amount of light to shine hallelujah hallelujah you must give her a certain amount of respect that when she walks among the rest of the women she has some honor to reflect hallelujah praise God you are the teacher you must teach her you are the bridegroom you must love her you are the Light Shine the Light is going to be a reflector the wife is the glory of the husband she's looking for some Glory out of your character so that she may manifest it she's the manifestation of the man's glory and that's what the Bible teaches hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord amen turn around your wife and you tell her you are my glory [Music] tell your wife you are my glory have some light Her [Music] Shine I'm not it I'm This Little Light of M going let it shine it Shine sh It Shine Christ is the light of the world is the husband to the church you you taking the light from the husband of the church to play back that image and you become the light so that she can have some light to shine God bless you God bless you we shall start from there do you him when you go home get your wife I know some of you ministers who are visiting your wives are not here but look her in the face and tell her you are my glory you are my glory then you start saying ah my wife is a wild love love cause that bull to get on her knees my wife is a very terrible Maniac brother Bram says let him alone let him come love brought that man to the feet of the Prophet the love of God kept them in their nest your wife Can Only Be Tamed you go back love her you go back love her and then she start smiling because she knows you are not coming home to blame her you are coming home to love her you are not coming home with your mother's image you are coming home to see the one whom the Lord give her as a part of your body get those images out my mother my mother mother do you love him do you love the Lord God bless you so much Shalom
