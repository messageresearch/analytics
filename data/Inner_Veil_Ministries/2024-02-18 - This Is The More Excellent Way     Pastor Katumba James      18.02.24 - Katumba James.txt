Happ should be continuous praise the name of the Lord not being happy today then tomorrow you are miserable because you don't have money in your pocket because you didn't eat well because you don't have clothes because you don't have school fees because you don't have job those are not the things to make you happy but what brings happiness is the Lord himself being in your life praise the name of the Lord and that should be our confidence praise the name of our Lord you know brother who came here at the beginning of this year from Zimbabwe we first had the meeting in May and then he preached for 4 hours and he was preaching about money what the Lord Jesus talks about money and there is the way I had not looked at these scriptures the way he brought them and then you know there are many scriptures actually when the Apostles of when the Disciples of John came to Jesus when John had sent them find out is he the one then Jesus told them go and tell John that the blind see the lamb walk the deaf here the dead are raised and to the poor the gospel is preached now when you are blind what you need is to see and the Lord was doing it when you are dead what you need is to rise up and the Lord was doing it when you are lame what you need is to walk and the Lord was doing it when you are deaf what you need is to hear and the Lord was doing it when you are dump what you need is to speak and the Lord was doing it but when you are poor he didn't give them money he gave them the gospel praise the name of our Lord and the Bible says let the poor say I am rich praise the name of the Lord so you shouldn't be unhappy because you don't have money because you don't have school Fe but be happy because you have the Lord in your heart praise the name of our Lord and the Lord will take care of every situation and the Bible says let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich praise the name of our lord it's very interesting praise the name of our Lord and you see when poor people live longer than sometimes richer people praise the name of our Lord but then we are bothered I don't have money I don't have job my plants are not doing well my animals are not doing well and then you have a lot of stress for the things of this world so just be happy in the Lord praise the name of our so we want to receive all the visitors who have come here for the first time amen is there somebody coming here for the first time if you just raise up your hand that recogize you yeah there is a sister somebody behind there you're welcome happy to have you around so our pastor is not around today he went to Nairobi yesterday so we just keep him in our prayers praise the name of our Lord and then also we want to appreciate those to come for the midweek services and just want to encourage every one of us let us keep on coming praise the name of our Lord yesterday we had praying and fasting and I want to appreciate those who able to turn up this coming Friday going to have the overnight praise the name of our so again come and we pray together praise the name of then on Wednesday last week we had more of a prayer meeting and then we just want so we can make more Wednesdays into prayer meetings preaching for 30 minutes but most of the time is dedication praise the name we just how much time we can yield to the Lord and you know on that Wednesday that's the day they referred brother Isaac to Mango hospital and he's still in mango hospital but his condition is not pleasing yesterday they put him on a life support machine up to now Andis that's for two times now his heart and kidy kind of like malfunctioning so IAL to sister betri this morning and she likewise appreciates you for your prayers and request to continue praying for them they found that the heart and the lungs are you know in the in the ordinary man's language they are sitting in water and then they found that there is carbon oxide in the lungs yeah so now the issue of removing from a life support machine to take is a challenge is feeding through the tubes and then now she was telling me that they may have to ref again to praise the name of but remember on Wednesday when you read in the book of Acts when James had been killed and then Herod saw that it was a good political tool to kill even Peter if you read in Acts 12 that's what we're sharing on Wednesday so Herod was determined to kill Peter and he arrested him and put a number of gods arounder but the Bible says prayer was made without ceasing of the Church of God for Peter because Herod was determined to kill him he was already prison and then he at the church continually prayed for Peter until now the angel came and delivered Peter and then the angel told Peter go and tell them and show yourself to them so it is until they saw Peter that they stopped praying and it should be the same thing with us now praise the name of until we brother Isaac back in church we shouldn't stop praying for him praise the name of our Lord that should be this burden we have on our heart Lord deliver our brother Lord restore our brother and the Lord is more than able to change things likewise brother the son of our brother he wants appreciate you brother wants to appreciate you for your prayer John's wife was able to give birth and now they dioniz because before they dioniz the child that some systems in the heart are not working but now they have found out that a section of the heart is not developed at all and so they don't understand the child is breathing or is alive I talk to John this morning they also still in mango hospital but then they are being referred to hospital to better manage that situation should also pray for that little son that the Lord May fully deliver him praise the name of our Lord and you know these things come that we can all stand up in prayer for praise the name of the Lord you know at least take some sleep away and then you say this time I'm praying for Johnny's son this time I'm praying for brother Isaac because if it is in your house you'll know how hard it is like the time sister B has been in hospital attending to the husband so we just need to have that kind of love for one another praise the name of our Lord so today we have an afternoon service for the Youth and then next time we shall have only one service praise the name of our Lord so now before we go into the reading of the word we have a dedication of a baby brother Ben's child that song bring them in as they bring the child forward amen bring them in bring them in bring them from the fields of s bring them in bring them in bring the wondering ones to Jes bring them in bring them Hallelujah bring them in oh yes bring them from from the fears of s bring them in bring them in bring [Applause] wondering ones to Jesus amen before we dedicate I always like reading this scripture that's Matthew chapter 19 from verse 13 to verse 15 praise the name of the Lord the Bible says there were brought unto him little children that he should to put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked [Music] them but Jesus said suffer little children and forb them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of [Music] heaven and he laid his hands on them and departed [Music] them now we see that in the denominations they baptize little children but in the Bible there was no little child baptized praise the name of the Lord because for you to qualify to be baptized the Bible says You must hear the gospel this child cannot hear the gospel and when you hear the gospel you believe the gospel with your heart This Little Child cannot believe anything and when you believe the gospel with your heart that's in Romans chapter 10 and then verse 8 to verse 10 and then after you've believed the gospel you confess with your mouth this child can not confess anything but now in the denomination they bring an aunt and an uncle are the ones who confess for the child what a deception it is and then they Scar the mothers that if your child dies when they are young they are going to hell but the Lord Jesus is saying these little children of such is the kingdom then how are you putting them out of the Kingdom because the child is faultless in MTH 18 and then verse two it says and Jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of [Music] them verse three and said V I say unto you except you be converted and become as Little Children You shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven [Music] nowo therefore shall not humble himself as little child the same is the greatest whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven now you see saying the children have no fault the kingdom belongs to them and then they are scaring parents that they are going to help if they not baptized that's just the deception of Satan as the little children are even when they pass on they are not going into any judgment or cond because the kingdom belongs to them praise the name of our Lord and that's why we are dedicating this little church [Music] amen this is Elijah the gift that the Lord has given the family of our brother Ben and sister let us pray father in the name of Jesus Christ here is Elijah who has been brought into your presence when our lord Jesus was here on Earth he laid his hands upon them and we therefore lay our hands Lord upon Elijah pronouncing your blessings upon his life in the name of Jesus Christ bind all forces and Powers of Darkness all plans of Satan that they may come again that may come against the life of this child we pray that Lord you may appoint your guardian angels upon his life to watch over his life Heavenly f as he grows up Lord father the coming of the Lord Tes we pray for the Salvation of this child that he may come to the know of Jesus Christ and accept the Lord Jesus as his personal we pray you may watch over his life father and Lord the time that you have appointed me on Earth may he dedicate his life unto you Lord he lived the life of Jesus Christ may you prosper Him Father physically Health Lord Jesus and spiritually in the name of Jesus CHR may we also pray father you may give the ability to the father and the mother of this child to provide for all his needs and also to have a positive influence in the way of the Lord Jesus Christ Grant this child good health Heavenly Father may the blessings from above be upon his life and even the household where he has been born in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen am God bless you [Music] amen praise the name of our Lord I want us to stand up and we return to our Bibles we go in the book of First Corinthians chapter 12 and then we're reading from verse 27 verse 31 271 so the Bible says 1 Corinthians 12 verse 27 to verse 31 praise the name of the Lord now you are the body of Christ and members in particular and God has set some in the church first apostles secondly prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues having all gifts have all gifts of healing do all speak with Tong do all interpret but honestly the best gift and yet I show you a more excellent way verse 311 let us pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we are so blessed people Lord that we can come before your presence and Lord sit under your arms of Love That Lord you may speak to our hearts we pray you may set our minds father and Lord May the Holy Spirit come down to search our hearts and to reach all our needs bless everyone of here this morning all the needs of your children Lord Your Divine Purpose and will be done for your glory and for your honor even pray for our Pastors in ministers May anoint him for the services of the Lord and we even remember Heavenly Father our brother in hospital then our brother John's wife Naomi and the son also forth your hands upon them and father deliver them from any kind of bondage affli or any sickness and restore them back to their homes we love you Lord and we thank you in the name of the Lord Jesus and ask this amen you may be seated amen so I just want to use that scripture in verse 31 which says yet I show unto you a more excellent way so I want to preach on the subject this is the more excellent way this is the more excellent way praise the name of the Lord you know it's just like when you are born you grow into something praise the name of the Lord and then at your maturity then you are able to bring to manifestation all that was inside of you the abilities that you had I want us to receive brother I'm sorry he a pastor in brother and's brother he was once here with us some years ago praise the name of our Lord we happy to have you around brother praise the name of our Lord and then there is Sister Edith you're also welcome amen so we are happy to be in the presence of God and I just request that you pay your attention praise the name of our Lord so the isas is a more excellent way praise the name of our Lord and you know in life you always aspire to do better praise the name of our Lord you always aspire to do to Excel or even then you see that even people who have some things they want to have more you know like I was reading some article sometime and then he said when you get a million do you admire the one who is having two so you want to increase one to two again when you reach two you want to get five when you get five to 10 and then you read about people who having now billions then you start wondering how you can reach there so there is that kind of urge in life of doing better than what I'm doing so here the Bible is telling us that there is a more excellent way you can have different gifts like now the Bible has talked about Apostles as the first gift and then he said secondly puts prophets thirdly puts teachers and then after Miracles then Gifts of healing then helps then governments and diversities of tongues and you know all these things are very good and then he says desire them and then we need to find ourselves what is our position in the body of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord what is your position in the body of Jesus Christ what are you serving in the body of Jesus Christ why has the Lord created you why are you still living praise the name of the Lord why has God put you here on Earth so then here he says when you get into the body of Jesus Christ there are gifts that he gives us but then he says we need to desire we need to see that we get into the more excellent way something which is more than all these kind of things now you may not be an apostle you may not be a prophet you may not be a teacher you may not be working miracles you may not be having maybe speaking tongues or interpretation of tongues but all of us should honestly desire the more excellent way more excellent way when we go to First Corinthians chapter 13 and then verse one the Bible says though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass and a tinkering symbol and though I have the gifts of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I can remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing now you look at this these gifts God gives them he gives you speaking in tongues you can speak in the tongues of angels you can speak in the tones of men but then the Bible says if you don't have charity then you have become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol so the Bible is telling us let us desire the more excellent way and then the more excellent way is Charity the more excellent way the love and the Bible says God is love and then the Bible says how do you say that you love God if you don't love your neighbor praise the name of the Lord so love is what the holy spirit is calling us upon this morning each of us should get that love in our lives get the love of God in your heart and when you have the love of God in your heart you will hate evil when you love the love of God in your heart you will love your enemies when you have the love of God in your heart you will love your children when you have the love of God in your heart you will love your parents when you have the love of God in your heart you will love your husband when you have the love of God in your heart you will love your you know your wife you will love your neighbors you will love your colleagues you will love strangers so now but you know the the kind of deception of Satan now is you can't become religious you can become religious and you know Satan allows you to be religious you can speak in Tong you can do Miracles or maybe you can preach a gospel or you can confess a message beli now if you don't have the love of God all in West it's all in vain so now the Bible is telling us there is a more excellent and the more excellent way charity the more excellent way is love each of us should have love in our heart and you should grow in love praise the name of our Lord the measure of your love may be small praise the name of the Lord if the measure of Love is bigger grow it praise the name of and you see when you look at the words of English the word more it means that but then he says excellent and excellent there's nothing Beyond excellent when you get 100% say excellent Excell but then he says more Excellence praise the name of Lord so you have to keep on growing in other words there is still room for you to grow there is need for you to surrender yourself more unto God praise the name of the Lord and you see the more you yield yourself to God the Bible says dra n to God and then God will draw n to you so the more you open your heart the more you grow into the love of God the more you grow the life of Jesus Christ and this is the desire of God for everyone of us now in verse three the Bible says 1 Corinthians 13:3 where have you been and though I best all my goods feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits me nothing praise the name of the Lord so you can imagine somebody can do charity work you know like these foundations yesterday I was in par and then and they were asking me it was were preaching to and then they were asking me we have many widows here does your church support widows then I told them we preach the word and I remember un the poor he gave the what the gospel because when you have the gospel will open those what you have need of praise the name of so now he says even if I best Goods to feed the poor and so I give my body to be burn and have not charity it pro me nothing and charity is God so you just need to have God within you to take over all your life and then verse for the Bible says charity suffers long and is kind charity EnV not charity V not itself charity is not puffed up see what charity is see what the more excellent way is Charity suffers long check your life I my patient oh every time you are off you know you just want ping pong when somebody speaks you sure that you hit back but the Bible says charity suffers long charity is kind find out yourself am I really kind do I really care charity EnV not you know that kind of jealous Spirit hatred you know Envy you don't desire something good for somebody and then the Bible says charity vth not itself you know is not bful is not want to be puffed up let everybody know who I am we need to strike the most excellent way does not behave s [Applause] unseemingly verse five seek not her own praise the name of the Lord is not easily provoked think no evil praise the name of the Lord thinks no evil may God be gracious to us someone does something bad it's not in your heart you need Grace praise the name of the Lord but the village some of us come from you find a gage for Generations the grandparent who had the other neighbor it's like between the Jews and the Palestinians from childhood they teach their children hate those Jews those Jews are bad we shouldn't have those kind of hearts and then sometimes it becomes so terrible that when the child hurts the parents the parents the thing they think about is curing the child why why is your Char for your child you will not have anything in future are you the father or the mother of that child why don't you bless your children why don't you bear with your children why don't you encourage your children so if you really have the love of God you say Lord have mercy upon my child Lord have mer upon my son you see there are those kind of grudges you know that people are not willing to live they ready to go in GRA with those gr why you are binding yourself you are failing to strike the more excellent way so you just need to leave all those grudges grud against your children grud against your parents and you know there are some children and they will talk bad about their parents and just make sure they don't help their parents that's not the way of the Lord and again you get to married people ah if my husband went with another woman no forgiveness and then he holds that Grudge there the Bible has told us there is a more excellent way praise the name of the Lord and admit and say Lord have mercy upon me Lord deliver me from this kind of Str they from this kind of hatred they from this kind of you know Str and bound praise the name of our Lord and then you allow God to release you praise the name of the Lord you look at the prodal son he took half of his [Applause] inheritance and then he went and wasted it withous living you know and then he after he had spent everything you know he cut off contact with the Father the father had worked hard to get these things but then the son wasted everything and went to a far country and started feeding swine and you know when the pigs would eat Huskers they would just can you imagine fall that child was but God was gracious that he remembered his father he said my father cannot mistreat me like that and there should be the same thing with us let your children have confidence that even when I've sinned so much against my father or my mother they can have an open door for me praise the name of the Lord and then you know in some families you know when maybe a child messes up they want to cast that child to the grandparents I'm not even paying your fees I'm not even doing this that one is still your child you have the responsibility to help that child until they succeed and that's the love of God praise the name of our Lord so the father didn't refuse the prod son when he was coming the Bible says when he saw him were far off he R to what an attitude we need to have he had compassion and we need to have compassion for one another don't hold on the grudges you all the time you are talking about that gra that gra it shouldn't be like that praise the name of the Lord have compassion have forgiveness so now the Bible says charity does not seek her [Applause] own you know you give your life over to another person and then charity rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth and the truth is the word of God and that should be where your joy is where your happiness is Charity Bears all things beli all things verse seven hopes all things endures all things charity never fath but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be Tong they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish that's the more excellent way charity we need to seek charity if you don't have Love in Your Heart pray to God and say Lord fill me with your love praise the name of our Lord let your love come down in my heart excise that love praise the name of the Lord he's not saying I love you but there's no action there has to be action following your confession praise the name of our Lord now in first John chapter 4 first John 4 verse the Bible says beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God the Bible says let us love one another a more excellent way is love when you have the love you love one another and then the Bible says love is of God so if you want God in your life love one another praise the name of our Lord and then the scripture says he that loveth is born of God and knoweth God verse seven praise the name of the Lord the Bible says let us love one another for love is of God praise the name of in other words it's God that gives us love in other words you've opened yourself and you have allowed God to come and sit in your heart and then you are exercising the attribute of God himself even to the benefit of another and if God comes down in your heart praise the name of our Lord you will love you will forgive praise the name of our Lord you will not rejoice in doing evil you want to rejoice in the truth praise the name of our Lord and then he says he verse 8 he that love not knoweth not God for God is love now let us measure our knowledge of God how much much do you know God the Bible says if you don't love you don't know God so how much of God do you have it's expressed by your love if you have hatred that's not of God that is of Satan so now we need to grow in love we need to get a more measure of love in our lives praise the name of our Lord then in verse 9 in this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in is love not that we loved God he loved us and sent his son to be the appropriation for our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelle in us and his love is perfected in Us Praise the name of our Lord he says if God is in us then we love one another and this is what the Lord Jesus say by this shall men know that you are my disciples when you love one another so love is of God and love is God so how much of God do you have check your love praise the name of our now you know there are some things which are strange praise the name of our somebody can be friends with the neighbor but he not friends with his children [Music] somebody can be friends with their colleagues but is not friends with the wife or the husband hypocrisy praise the name of the person you live with and then there is hatred there is enmity that's not of God praise the name of Lord you wish the other to die got a problem you are happy that's not of God praise the name of our Lord but we just need to allow God to come down in our hearts you know when God comes down in your heart he changes you he takes that bad mind or bad desire out of you he transforms you praise the name of our Lord the love of God himself comes down your heart that even you love your enemies you even love for you even love your bosses who who exploit you they don't pay your money you're not praying a problem to come upon them but you see you love them how about your own household praise the name of our Lord so we need to exercise the love of God and then the Bible says in John 14 and then verse Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man comes unto the father but by meise the name of Lord so you need Christ in your life to exercise his love when Christ is not in your heart you will not have that love you will pretend but then you need Christ himself he says I am the way without Christ you can't find that I am the truth it is Christ himself so when you are in the way you will find the truth and then you get life and the Bible says Abundant Life the life of God himself the love of God being exercised in you praise the name of our Lord so you start by removing hatred from your heart stop those conf at least be ashamed to mention that praise the name of be ashamed to say that and when you ashamed then you remember I need to Love My Enemy and then there are people who hate others without any cause there is nothing somebody has done to them they hate they hate praise the name of the Lord you know we need not to have broken systems let us go to Jeremiah chapter 2 and then verse 13i the Bible says for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and have held them out systems broken systems that can hold no water now these broken systems the Bible says they cannot hold any water you shouldn't be that kind of Christian who cannot have the spirit of God who cannot retain the spirit of God so the Bible is saying my people have committed two they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters so when you don't have love you have forsaken the Lord because God is love and now the Bible says love one another the Bible says you have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Water now if you forsake the Fountain of Living wat then what are you going to retain praise the name of the Lord what are you going to contain how shall many know who you are and then the Bible says by this shall men know that you are my disciples if you love one another but then you have forsaken the Fountain of Living Water how are you going to be a well how are you going to to have water flowing through how how is it going to happen and yet when God makes you aware he also you know he also wants you to be giving out that's the principle of God when there is life in you that life must be manifested that life must also be tested by others it's not you saying I have life but there is no benefit to others praise the name of Allah Jesus was telling the woman at the word that the Living Water that I give you shall also be a well shall be springing up to life in John chapter 4 and then verse 14 but soever drink of this water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life praise the name of our Lord he says he gives you that water the living water and then the Living Water becomes a spring and then that Springs keeps on flowing out flowing out praise the name of and that's what we need the life of Jesus Christ himself to come down in us and when you have the Life of Christ it will keep on flowing out like Psalms 1 the Bible says blessed is the man who does not praise the name of our Lord let us go and pick that scripture there Psalms 1 and then verse one blessed is the man that walks not in the C of the ungodly nor stand in the of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scold the Bible says he does not to walk in the Cel of the ungodly the ungodly will never forgive they don't have anything like forgiveness in their until the Bible says that the tender masses of of an evil person is Cru and then and the Bible says The Tender Mercies of the wicked person is to well for you see spping is so cruel but this man Sayes have forgiven him I would have even killed him now the Bible is telling us you don't stand in that cel of the ungodly you don't stand in the C of Revenge you don't stand in the C of envy you don't stand in the C of hatred you take hatred from this generation to the other generation until some people I don't want made da Mar in that family or in that you know there is just that kind of ungodly C because they saw somebody do this only one person is a conclusion to condemn all the Bible says you don't stand in that c and you don't stand in the way of sinners in other words you are not following what they are doing praise the name of the Lord you don't take that as your stand I also do that's not the word of a Christian then the Bible says they don't sit in the seat of the scornful how to pick on this until people make decisions on rumors this one oh no and then there are those who know how to make rumors and they experts the news have moved everywhere we shouldn't sit on the seat of the SC praise the name of our Lord for you what what the hot news is H this has happened should not be our purpose if you know somebody has done something wrong take that in prayer and say Lord I Saw sister son so do I son so do this Lord have mercy upon and don't take that as a ground to put another person down praise the name of the Lord now the Bible says in verse two but his Delight is in the law of the Lord praise the name of our Lord your Delight is in the law of the Lord and then if you Delight in something you take time in that thing praise the name of our Lord you take time because you Delight in the word of God you meditate upon the word of God day and night so you don't Delight to sit in the seat of the scornful other if you sit in the seat of the then you Delight inning you Delight in ruming but if that is your weakness say Lord have mercy upon me Lord deliver me from this kind of situation Lord change me praise the name of our Lord so we need to Delight in the word of the Lord you hear the word you think about the word you meditate upon the word when you hear the word of God it will change your thinking when it changes your thinking when your enemy comes and you've been meditating upon the word of God you remember the word of God says love your enemies and now if the devil was bringing something to do bad about him the word said I should love my enemy now the devil can now come and tell you maybe speak bad things then you remember Ah that's not right and then the devil can tell you ah let me do this bad thing no that's not right so when you take the word of God it changes your thinking it changes your speech changes your action and so as you keep on yielding the word of God will bring you into the maturity of that and when you get into the maturity of the world then you are striking a more excellent Way You Are yelding you allowed that Fountain of Living Water to keep on flowing through you and when the fountain is Flowing it keeps on washing that that away it washes away head it washes our evil imaginations it washes our evil things it washes away all those things that are contrary to the world and then you find that when the clean water comes it comes inside when it is going out it is dirty but just keep allowing it flowing it will keep on kind of cleaning the channel it will clean your heart the other evil spirit of Envy the other evil spirit of this kind of things they will all keep on going away going away going away going away praise the name of our Lord so we need to be The Fountains of Living Water praise the name of the Lord and allow the Lord to take over your life praise the name of the Lord now in the message questions and answers I hope you get it it is in 1963 there's something I want to read questions and answers of March 24th it says rivers of water I don't know if you can type that rivers of water rivers of water sea same water I'm trying to get it also on my phone now he says let us start from this way and then and like in the prayer for the sick that's all together different it is visions and things you study different and you are anointed different it's just like the Bible say a tree that's planted by the rivers of water rivers of water same water but there is Outlet Comes This Way while your outlet comes com this way there is this way and that way in other words it is the same spring but he has different Outlets praise the name of our Lord and so when you have the Fountain of Living Water it releases its attributes like the Bible says the fruit of the spirit let us go to Galatians chapter 6 let us go to the book of Galatians rather chapter 5 and verse 22 says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith weekness Temperance against such there is no law Galatians Galatians 5:2 and verse 23 oh God but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law verse 22 verse 5 verse 5 Galatians 5 verse 22 verse 23 so now you see it is the same Holy Spirit it is the same Fountain of Living Water but now when it goes into your system when it comes in your heart it will give an outlet of love to give an outlet of Joy give Outlet of peace to give an outlet of long suffering to give an outlet of gentleness to give an outlet of meekness an outlet of goodness an outlet of Fai an outlet of temperance same Fountain praise the name of our Lord and that's what we should always desire make me a fountain not a broken system which cannot retain anything but a fountain you know a broken system it can have it can have those things like frogs things there your system should not have those kind of things praise the name of our Lord now in the message broken systems he says be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect can you be because a perfect one represents us that Fountain is there every day fresh it is continuous it's a living Fountain even when the storms are so high it's a living Fountain and that that's which D desire you know have the spirit of God through in your life and now when the spirit of God is with a challenge of hatred the outlet of love will come out the spirit of hatred when bitterness come the spirit of God in you will come out with goodness to combat that bitterness when kind of fear and and unrest comes then the spirit of God will come out with that kind of meekness with that kind of gentleness it keeps on flowing out and that is the life of Jesus Christ that's the more excellent way that we need to desire in our Liv in the midst of the challenges you face at your place of work at your home let the fountain keep on flowing praise the name of our Lord let it not be a broken system let it not contain things that are wrong let it be a living Fountain and so the prophet says not some something but fresh every day washes away all my sins and he is that Fountain praise the name of our Lord you know a living Fountain has life in it we should also have Life of Christ and when we have the life of Jesus Christ let us manifest that life let it be manifested in us let it become alive in us praise the name of our Lord then he says now in closing I may say this anything different from this is broken systems and we will finally will and we finally lick out in it if you are putting all your hopes all your time and everything in one of those staged systems Jesus said they were broken systems they are broken they will lick out whatever you put in them you can't go any fur with them because they leak out for he is the only way to the truth the life and to Eternal joy and eternal peace he is the only one and the only one to that the inexhaustable Fountain of Life is Jesus Christ and who is he the word the same the same word the life the fountain the same yesterday to done forever the True Believer it is his sueme Joy his Supreme life and his Supreme satisfaction is in Christ no pumping no pulling no joining no bailing just believing and resting that's what is he is to the believing like Father Abraham he never pulled he never threatened he never worried he heard the word he laid upon El Shad bre when Abraham was 100 years old God appeared to him and said I am the almighty the Hebrew word El means the blessed one and you are old and your strength is gone out but let upon my bosom and enance your strength from this Fountain amen what did himself to a a new body he had the baby by Sarah and 50 years later had seven children by another that's what we need to depend upon a living Fountain and when that fountain comes into you you also become a living Fountain you start flowing out and let the people see your good works and glorify the father who is in heaven we need to strive the more excellent praise the name of our Lord the more excellent way now it may have stages you know like for example when we go to John chapter 15 and then we read in verse one praise the name of our Lord John 15 and verse one I am the True Vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he pures it that it may bring forth more now you look at these stages here he says if you don't bear fruit he cuts it in other words you are in a bad condition you are scoring 0% you have not allowed the life to pass through but if you are planted in the vine if you are joined in the vine allow the life of the vine to flow through you and now when the life of the vine throw you the Bible says you bear fruit praise the name of the Lord allow that life to flow through you allow the word of God richly dwell in you and when the word of God is richly dwelling in youy that word follow that word and that's how that word will bear its own kind praise the name of our Lord so now if you are in the branch or if you are the branch and then you are joined and then you are joined to the vine allow the life of the vine flow through you and then when the life of the vine flows through you then you will bear fruit but that should not be the end the Bible says there is a more excellent way in other words there are more fruit to Bear praise the name of our Lord so now if you have allowed the life to flow through you then you bear fruit but then when you bear fruit the Bible say he PES you he cleans you he sanctifies you he rebukes you don't do this don't go in that kind of place stop those kind of evil what is he doing he is puding you he is cleaning you why because wants you to Bear more fruit you are bearing fruit but he wants you to Bear more fruit he's calling you to a higher level he's calling you to a more excellent level praise the name of our Lord each and every one of us the Lord is calling us to a higher level than what we are now praise the name of our Lord you can say me I don't hate anybody but the issue is do you love everybody praise the name of the Lord I'm not guilty of hating anybody but yet you don't love everybody so he's calling you to a higher level come up praise the name of the Lord and then I will show you things that are going to happen and you know you can't when you are down here you can look at the trees here but when you go up you look at them better and when you go higher the the vision broadens praise the name of our Lord and that's what should be our desire higher higher every day living higher praise the name of the Lord more excellent way so he says if you bear fruites you you know some of this business the things that take your time yeah you know you are all the time on social media until even sleeping at night you don't there is a higher to live than that and then you find the whole week you've not read any message book week even the scriptures you don't know is it Jesus who said this or it is joh it doubt has already started coming in your mind and then the devil can start telling youh Jesus didn't die and then you can believe that why because your mind has been taken away from the truth the life is not flowing but now you talk about these programs on television you know there are some of those movies they put then they put the next one then they give you a preview and then maybe if you at home you start discussing I don't know what they are going to do I don't know how this is going to receive this where is the word of God what are you benefiting from that even those people don't know you just like the Sports World somebody will have a team he likes and then he will convince the other are going to buy the other one how much money have you put there and then he says the other time we didn't allow the other one to play they even don't know you but you're putting your time into the and then there is a time here in ginger I was moving to town and then I saw a vles in Convoy and then they had the flag of some team in Europe and they were busy moving on the streets that they celebrating because they want another team them actually brainwashed NE colonialism they can't even support their local teams like they can't support these teams which are here but the other ones there out they know them you how the devil place I was yesterday in a village a Countryside and then I was surprised there is there in the village and then they put European teams are play brainwashed so how are you going to Bear more fruit if you put your time in those things you don't have time to wait on the Lord you don't have time to seek the face of the Lord but the devil has put Alternatives and you know the devil is smart he puts alternatives you don't want to spend time on phone he puts there television you don't want that he puts there radio if you don't want that he put in the trading center or he put their sports betting so all these things are there to cheat you this one takes you other one Tak if you can't afford he puts also friends who can't afford and then you're going to L and you are just there busy because you may say I don't go to disco but there's something Satan has put around you so you can't bear fruit and then the Bible says he cuts off the branch you become dry praying at home is difficult reading the Bible you feel and you know there some people after church they forget where they put their Bible they remember on Sunday is my Bible and some of them have got new Bibles and it is still new for 5 years don't read it they don't know where to find this book talking about the book of Nehemiah Isiah a book you know they just don't know where they're standing sometime has been put in something but when you ask that person who was the top scorer oh the other man his 23 years of age he was able to save this was able to this where is your heart now and the Bible says where are your Pleasures are that's where your heart but those things don't have life they have pleasure praise the name of our Lord there's a scripture you have just remembered in Luke chapter 8 and then verse 14 the Bible says and that which fell among the thores are they which have heard go forth and are chocked with the cares and riches and the pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection now you look at how the devil is also a strategist now the Lord is telling us if one doesn't bear cuts off but when you bear fruit he purges you and you bear more fruit praise the name of our Lord we shall get back to this scripture let us go back to John chapter 15 and then we read in verse verse four abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide no more can you except you abide in me I am the vine and you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing look at these four stages first of all no bearing fruit zero bad condition then the next stage you bear fruit but the master God himself he wants you to do better he wants you to excel from bearing fruit to bearing more fruit and there are things that he does in our lives to take us higher come up here you've been doing well but you know to do better than each and every one of us we do well to come to church but we need to do better to come in time to church praise the name of our Lord you do well to come to church on Sunday but you need to do better to come on Wednesday to church praise the name of our Lord you do well to come on Wednesday I don't Sunday but you also need to do better by coming also on Saturday coming for the overnight what is too busy for you that you deny God the time to power his living water in your life to refresh you and every time we come to church there is a refreshment of God something that encourages you something that lifts you up so the Lord is calling us to a higher level you be at 30% but you need to go to 60% You' been at 60% but you need to go to 100% that's what the Lord is calling us there is a more excellent way and we need to strive to get that way so the Bible is telling us if he doesn't bear cuts off if you bear fruit he pures you praise the name of the Lord when he pures you you bear more fruit and when you bear more fruit he says abide in me in other words deny yourself abide in me then I abide in you let the mind of God be in you the mind that was in Christ he offered himself he surrendered himself he allowed all God to pass through him and if we can also do the same then he says you'll bring much fruit from zero pray for grace then you bear fruit 30% he works upon you so that you bear 60% so that you bear more fruit when you bear more fruit you at 60% he wants you to get much too 100% there is a more excellent way praise the name of and now don't allow the devil to deceive you be involved in all the church programs praise the name of the Lord if the door has been open be there available and be faithful in your duty praise the name of our Lord let us go to Luke chapter 8 praise the name of our Lord Luke chapter 8 and then verse 15 verse 14 so he says and that which fell among the thorns a day which when they have heard go forth and and are chocked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection now you know the devil is so evil and he a strategist you know he says cares now that is a stage of its own praise the name of our then another stage is riches that's a stage of its own and then another stage is Pleasures now you can't have Pleasures if they are disturbing you don't e you don't have you don't have enough money for Pleasures so you work hard and when you work hard you get riches but every stage has its own Temptations every stage has traps so because you and you know there are some of those people because I'm poor so he goes and gets where he can get and then he thinks after becoming rich he will come to praise the name of Lord the Bible says he that is faithful in the little is faithful in the much if you don't have and you're not faithful you think you'll be when you have so the devil puts all these kind of things now when you get the riches they getting Temptations there is this mind has come that mind has come now when you get the riches then another level is pleasur we have football this afternoon time is coming to one
