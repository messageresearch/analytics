I've got a few things to take out of the way I'm sometimes very nervous when I'm going to preach I don't want anything to go wrong okay because it takes my mind that way amen Amina so when we come to the house of the Lord let everything be in order praise the Lord amen amen so uh there is amen she has a bad condition that is uh literally putting her down she's a very young lady but she has to have a walking stick to get around it's not good to go on clutches at that age so we are going to put our faith together because she is being suggested to be taken for a spinal surgery but we can pray that God the creator of heavens and earth can create a new spy eyes let this be a testimony to us that we serve a living God just put your faith together with me let us stand up now don't leave this to me alone everybody has brought a leak of fire and so we need to lift up our hearts foreign foreign [Music] [Music] with the opportunities [Music] see praise the Lord You're gonna be remembering them in prayers and just watch for The Testament amen amen so you may be seated I've got another uh special thing to put out of their way I want to invite amen this is Brother Martin Brother Martin is a very he has got a group of his young people that he has mobilized together and he does a lot of ministry our own life so any of you that do not know that just not the channel and just listen to the sermons that brother martin preachers we are going to allow him to stand behind our desks so in his life is somebody special and let her come foreign amen Amina so now we need to know from the bridegroom what's her name is Grace so I think she's comforting Grace amen amen so I am privileged this morning to announce the engagement and also marriage plans between our brother martin and our sister Comfort Grace Comfort is one of those young girls who have grown up with us but when the Lord gives us the gift of life life just flourishes like that children become women and now they become mothers and not long after that amen amen so we serve a living God because we used to see some of the people growing before us amen sister plus is a good example and then she is now a grandmother isn't that wonderful sometimes as the ministers we don't see that we are aging away when I first traveled to North America North America I was working with elder ministers and many others brother Doug Matthews but right now when I was there yes most of the ministers are younger people so we need the younger people to come and stand in the garden because we are walking away we are not going to be here foreign [Music] so it's going to be here and just you know you are invited and let us prayer 75 we give thanks that have made their way father to become husband and wife they've announced their engagements before us and the plans for their marriage I therefore father pray blessings for everything they have needed and I pray dear Lord Jesus as you get them together of the goodness of God amen Amen in Jesus name May the grace of God amen so um I want the young people to come again to give us two songs before we get into the teaching of the world Amen Amina so today as we teach the world I want you to go a totally different path this is the Easter morning and I want you to go with such a glorious amen Amina God bless you as we listen to these young people before we go into the teaching of the world looks like you're guilty now what do you say I spoke your honor I have no [Music] deep and that's when my sea will tears oh let's see what Peter [Music] praise [Music] [Music] forgiven Witness [Music] ES [Music] [Music] is [Music] wonder how these [Music] but someone is so guilty I had just been set free foreign [Music] can it please [Music] [Music] the blood was presented [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] Hallelujah amen when the when the court was set the court was sent uh amen Amina the only thing that could save was muscle foreign [Music] [Music] days [Music] [Music] [Music] things [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] even [Music] the talking today [Music] [Music] [Music] oh the Lost will be if you want your loved ones [Music] before us together [Music] describes [Music] [Music] Lord the blood is [Music] to cry [Music] and glory to God [Music] [Music] baby praise the lord it's a good Easter morning it's the rising of the sun amen Amina praise the Lord so um we know that Bible teaching is a little treacherous but then every teacher must not teach the people away from scripture because our Prophet was a Biblical teacher amen amen so the problem is that men who have read their message they read it not side by side with the Bible but we thank God he has given us the grace to put the two together and we can never go wrong I believe you all have the seven seal book it is so I want you to go and start the the bridge between the seven Church edges and the Seven Seals you see I like that message because it teaches us the fullness of redemption you may not really be able to understand it fully but when you come next Sunday you are going to be able to piece up those missing links that you could not put together because I love people who study abasama and develop questions so I just choose this message foreign [Music] foreign [Music] the message bridge is what gives a man of true Founders in this message amen amen let's stand up and get to the scripture reading Romans there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spiritual is let's buy heads and other prayer father he said for me we bow our heads to go take him into a day because the hearts are bowed before you Quran we are before a supernatural presence and there is nowhere Heavenly Father we can be able to have this Fellowship unless your grace Texas where are we don't here by the natural hereby that he that is foreign and so you know when the court is is Set uh there are certain processes that always happens there is a criminal [Music] and then there is a judge many times so you know then the accused that the prosecutors and mentions because this Christ of Nazareth claims to be God yeah and in the case of Christ anyway there was no Advocates there is a [Music] that there is a loss of the case certain times when he was bringing your Redemption he did not pass through a court system he brought it directly to you yeah you didn't have to prove you are sinless you are not concerned because you didn't go through a Judicial System are you getting where I'm going this morning that's what Grace means that Grace just comes when that you know Courtney said and the master says there is no case here is forgiveness so my title this morning by passing the judicial system foreign [Music] amen Amina we shall understand it better together by passing the judicial system upstairs the power money of the Easter seal again amen Amina that's where we are going to work from so the Bible call in the Bible refers to the mystical Body of Christ that is chosen out of the church spiritual wife to Christ and God has chosen the institution of the Bible marriage to Define this relationship amen Amina so the true Bible marriage husband and wife the little Israeli Define the relationship of Christ at this church Christians because their marriages must be a clean Testament concerning Christ's relationship with the church yes so when the Bible speaks of holy women I want you to see them as women that were showing us images [Music] [Music] we [Music] got women like a Mary anymore to look at those with the land years of the true church and foreign [Music] amen [Music] [Music] as a teacher are you together with me what is it he was the manifested that is now the restored to the church in the last days amen when Christ came among using he came as the teacher amen amen that's the Sonoma he's always a teaching Prophet now everybody they always say thus says the Lord we're bringing the word to the people even when Jesus came here he would also teach the wife [Music] so as the boy by faith we stand on the sure word of Prophecy and then I want you to see that these women in the Bible they always reflected in this time that the church has today are you together the faithfulness of Surah to Abraham interprets to us amen Amina amen amen the faithfulness that we as the brother amen amen so the faithfulness of Sorrow to Abraham speaks of the church amen amen in Hebrews chapter 11. we are going to look at these women how their lives were always challenging because a woman represents the church if the people want to know about to have a documentary the standard of our church they are going to look at the women that come to the church how would they behave themselves how they do their faces you reflect the standard of the church and your opinions and marriage in you I mean you your obedience in the marriage amen you also testify of the standard of the church [Music] [Music] [Music] women don't have women don't have food but you see the scripture says to the country women know how to enter into the spirit they know how to enter into the spirit of their husbands when certain things are failing the mother says I will handle your father don't mind mama she knows how to enter into the spirit just like the church would know how to enter into the spirit of Christ wants to teach us about the church he talks I mean he talks women meaning women are Faith received their dead rest life again we've got Elijah to Greninja Anderson [Music] [Music] [Music] received their loved ones back [Music] on the third today [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] let me tell you more about these women here at three o'clock that afternoon amen nine o'clock no chairs they leaned against each other and they were waiting till that night my brother that was special people coming in tonight to be able to go into the beach [Music] until the later in the night amen maybe seven o'clock when brother Brenda would come and preacher such a face are you together with realism but some of us they just look at the watch the pastor begins at such and such the pastor is not the fullness of the service the service begins with one preparing himself getting in the spirit meditating you have me into design praying for the service and then the song The testimony [Music] against the set of styled groups my anymore and it's pouring down it was raining and Mr MOA kept telling me my mind there's something going on in that line there is something going up there and the Billy came to me right and said yeah he can't hold that line any longer amen amen there is a little woman with a dead baby that died this morning and she's climbing over the moon received their loved ones back to life the mother mama would that let the baby girl yeah wouldn't imagine the baby to be laid in the grave she was fighting yeah will you fight all the way to the change of your body that's the faith of a woman does not easily give up there will be so many obstacles you go down there and pray for them and Brother Moore started down and I looked out here in front of me and the vision come of course of the little baby raising amen now Khan said these things unless they're authentic and the little baby I'm not the little mother down there screaming Padre Padre the word Padres Padre means father she was a Catholic and when I said bring the little bloody here [Music] and she had a blanket over it it's soaking wet again couldn't speak to her amen no one there to interpret I just laid my hands and offered to God a little prayer [Music] which was actually inherited conditions so we went down to hospital they looked at him and the doctors said this is that condition doesn't heal but then we were given medicine so that we could go back and so when we were given foreign and I wanted to tell you we kept you watching past that wanna but the condition never came back amen Amina area Bible Church must possess they didn't know Korea the faith of those holy women Hallelujah a real Bible Church must possess rapturing faith in her quick it is the faith that brought the loved ones back to life is the same thing God has given to the brother to use so that she herself and come to her body amen so I truly believe that before the church can have instructions it must have a rupturing Faith amen but God's just now loosening up the foreign [Music] [Music] is literally personal contact [Music] that's not your revenge is not via the rich younger ruler Doctrine but I have done these things you may not have smoked you may not have drank your services [Music] [Music] [Music] to bring to you your Redemption foreign [Music] [Music] are you together with it one is it God bypass the judiciousness preaching is wonderful and sometimes it catches us in our position and then realize we are sin I went to America and then we get that Godly soul for sin but there are so many people that have cried about their sins but they don't abide they walk away they don't receive it they just got sorrowful and the body was lived in the same we always have the feeling of course are you together with me but that condemnation the judicial system and then it comes to you that you never did it from the beginning there has always been another Spirit the spirit of the sport is the one who did that now in the name of Jesus and you need to have your peace just being justified by faith we have faith with god he has Justified us he has taken away the root of seeds he has declared a son and the daughter of God where does that come from again went out there to see them they make the communion wine for the church yeah this was sitting there in the room she had been seek all her life foreign [Music] [Music] you started looking for the spirit he couldn't find them and then God came down and told him ask him how many do you like yeah [Music] [Laughter] so that's what they were talking about it's just happened a few days before and while sitting around that they were talking about all at once I say just I said brother right you are anonymous haunted Spirits all your life your brother Shelby you were unexpected also I invited them since the key did you ever see a squirrel in this ticket and they said I want you to see how God gets close you should always pay very close attention when you come to the house look at how you know Jesus took that woman at the well one step at a time until she said that I know you are the one the prophet to come foreign [Music] you don't come here they don't know to hear an intellectual uh preach it is a man today was so special you come to touch God in that message maybe he's telling his experience like brother Brandon was telling his experience but that's where the channel to get to the boys maybe when you come down here what you needed so wait wait is the testimony of sisters for you to get also in the channel to bring down the supernatural Hallelujah [Music] [Music] God bless you brother handclap praise the Lord foreign through our composition I took a series here how the dead Race by a simple question from Sister Maria here and we've got about 20 Services when we are together and we are children of God we should watch for God in one another amen Amina she says that's nothing but the truth sister and when she said the right thing okay let's go back to you when she said that all right okay the Holy Spirit dropped off in the channel again every one of them I said sister my sister sister the holy spirit is speaking to me now and said to me to give you the desire of your house yes sir she was able to twelve the Holy Spirit to the points in the beginning foreign [Music] you don't have to give up when you can keep training she trailed that you know Fellowship okay and then the prophecy says ask for the desire and then she was confused if the Holy Spirit God wants to this for you right now say what you want if I was here because when God needed to come to the resurrection he says Lazarus come forward why did I mention him if I were him I would take the promise amen amen you know I said now if I be God's servant if it will happen if I had God's suffered and it won't happen I'm a deceiver I said now try and see what is the spirit of God and everyone who was crying she said what shall I asked you got a preposition amen I had twenty dollars in my pockets that she had put in the foreign [Music] [Music] foreign now listen her boys had got to be regular rickies I mean school days [Music] and 15 16 years old and all they were standing over there laughing at what I was saying [Music] it sounds like a soul could say [Music] is God [Music] [Music] ask for your sister I knew then like a job there is just something you know when you strike it while you waiting to it is happiness was going into the prayer line he wouldn't say nothing he would just be fellowshipping here and there he says I'm waiting on here immediately knows when he strikes that channel okay [Music] you are going to come down here and give a testimony amen Amina so I I I I knew here I stand before about 10 people I said if it doesn't happen then I'm a false prophet because I said it's up to you make your decisions I cannot make your decisions she looked around a little woman and all at once Jesus they were laughing they were coughing about our brother was acting the presence he was just up and down you can ask foreign [Music] he did not look at the yesterday of souls did not look up the yesterday of the man at the cross I tell you when it's going to save you bypasses the judicious because all I'm sinned and come short of the glory of God you are not an exceptions you are going to be worried because you are not sure because you know there are certain things behind this is he does not look at you yesterday he didn't look at the yesterday of those boys foreign [Music] do you believe when he was coming your way he did not look at you yesterday [Music] and it convicts us to see it it's not our sorrow to sin that saves us [Music] amen Titus Chapter three amen verse 5. not by works of righteousness see why because which we have died now Paul is not saying you've not done them he says you have done this you are like the rich younger rules but yet your good works is not what saves you the Easter sealer when Jesus broke death yes that's what releases the grace that saves us not by walks of righteousness which we have died but according to his mercies he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy ghosts through Jesus Christ that being justified by his grace according to the hope of eternal life that being justified by Grace not through the future of the Lord because by the fruit of the law you lose it so look at the grace of Calvary this is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that Jesus has given you his grace it was death by firing squad and many times you know brother Branham talks about it but a pattern was written by President Abraham Lincoln is because you know this boy here hard to personally give the pardon to the Executioner yeah execution and the one who is going to hang him but then due to the hurry it was not this pattern was not written on the letterhead amen letterheads amen Amina and you see it also had to have a sale don't think so we're not there I mean and this young man rejected it yet because of the Simplicity of How It Was Written yeah Hallelujah I just wish you can understand that's your mind keeps telling you you've not done enough to be saved yes and your mind keeps you under condemnation so this boy condemned himself to death but a pattern in the external world could not be written on such a simple page when the curse was tried in the court um when white the boy was executed when the boy was executed you see foreign [Music] laughs so he had nothing to show against his judgments I know there are many here in Detroit but feel the condemnation they feel a pull to come to church and they come down here however no but they've never been assured amen of their salvation today I want you to learn from this year you should not reject your path you should stand before the devil and tell him I am justified amen and the verdict was passed by the federal judge that a pardon is not a pattern if not accepted as a pad are you together with me a pardon is not a patterns foreign it comes directly to you oh yeah that's what is to me the judge himself [Music] that when you stand before death sentence [Music] see you complicate your salvation [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you now the system to bypass the Judicial Systems stems from the Shadows of the law every day that will help in the presence of judgment Grace will always be somewhere doesn't matter since but when you release on it you hold on it releases the showers of the washing Waters of the world foreign [Music] you know the devil standing can never allow you that in South Ghana to see the good that's in you every time because he's called I mean he's a condom yeah he can't encourage you on God he can't do that he just keeps you know foreign [Music] are you together with it so CeCe was not his campaign he has only had to bring out the back as long as the devil is not the campaigner of God He will always be disappointing at your weak area [Music] and when you look at that you cannot receive Department you get into battle you sink into the pressure okay foreign [Music] [Music] that's Grace okay so by passing judgments are you together with it what is it amen Grace was before the Lord exactly myself and I mean during the law and after the Lord amen amen but could not be enforced as long as the law was still in its proper place so God who is reaching in myself did not want anybody you know many people don't like the preaching of God's grace but there is no way you will never save yourself if you bypass singles the grace you'll stand before the Lord you see what I mean God who is rich in mercies never wanted you to die in your seats listen about this woman who was coaching a doubt praise God every time looks for a way of setting you free you begin to get gloomy foreign hahaha so now in verse John 8 7. he says so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself what is that he that is without sin among you let him fast cast the first story [Music] that he can save himself let him cast the fastest they discovered they are under the same bracket they all needed the grace of God when he brought them before the Lord they needed they discovered they cannot be perfect but in the midst of the Lord everyone who came with the storm dropped one stone and then it says or 20 years ago he throws up yeah and then Jesus lifts up in his face and he says where are your choosers say that to her yes oh no so Grace is not encouraging adults but rather Grace is bypassing the judicial system it is it amen so that's why we are happy today [Music] foreign [Music] people like it to feel condom about today even when the word says we're forgiveness they don't want to believe the church has sealed him away they wanted everybody to come through their system you go into the confession books [Music] and then you tell the father then the father will tell you you are forgiveness he shall come to pass in the last days there's nothing going to stop it there will be light in the evening times I don't care how many series you try to put over it to foreign forever [Music] and he cannot be sealed away from people anymore that you can relax do you feel released this morning the same seal that I wear is that he may break in the form of addiction as well said this token here is personal to order it's personal to order come together it's the oil now I'm after you cannot share it is he would hang his wrath away are you together but this young man rejected let me tell you it doesn't matter how light Grace may sound it's the only thing that can save yourself amen Amina so you know this Grace comes in Korea with justification which is a pattern in itself justification and took the spirit of adoption the moment you accept that father thank you foreign that Spirit takes into the study of the world and the more word you are ready sanctification God has started the work in your life let's go to Romans 8. amen amen you see I always want to bring something from several different angles if you miss me here you can't miss me then so when I'm coming down here I chose always the Sunday morning because sun is the Lord's Day [Music] is the Lord's Day let me tell you when brother door your wisdom take their cards to worship they have to sit until it is over we have to see it until it's done amen amen Romans 8 15. for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear [Music] when the problem is given explain but the fear of death and the fear of Hell steps are you together with me praise God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption you realize that you are a lovely son um [Music] it [Music] [Music] [Music] that begins the work of Justice [Music] that keeps the testimony foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you don't believe to receive you believe because you have foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] has been seen as seen foreign [Music] you know Abraham Lincoln Ibrahim Lincoln was the way of the gravity of the boy's sea yeah but he was the only one that had the power he had enough wings of justification to qualify this boy as though he never did it in the first place if then they say you are forgiving then you did it again [Music] foreign are you together so your Redemption is to remove this nature and once that nature is removed foreign that's the way God works us the evidence if you get Jake and you put it in this shirt it becomes as white as this one if the name the evidence of this color is no longer there but foreign [Music] one blood sacrifice of God's forgetfulness but God's forgetful are you together because you have memories America [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] he insisted in the Judgment listen to the mind of cake he weighed his own sin and it was so great and the only thing that could take the Sea church amen Amina are you together with the bunnies and once we get into the way of cave [Music] it becomes and finally when you look at the blood it looks so simple and then you dis I mean you declare yourself yo [Music] he says my punishment is greater than I can bear yeah if you know it's greater than you can bear this is you reject the remedy of the blood [Music] [Music] for that particular purpose [Music] because if you start looking at church you want to make it look at yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign say no [Music] because there is nobody that is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] that's how to approach God Amen so by looking at us through the eye of Justice we would not qualify it was going to step into that presence but he looks at us through the blood of Jesus Christ it's not judgments amen amen he says oh Lord according Truth by righteousness is not according to my righteousness but you're righteous be turned away from thy City Jerusalem we won't overcome [Music] away very Holy Mountain because of us and for the iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people have become a reproach to all that are about us and this supplication and because thy first to shine upon thy sanctuary [Music] for we do not present our supplications before the for our righteousness [Music] my God for my city and thy people are called by thy name for thy great masses and not your Justice not our Justice foreign amen I mean I pray that God may see me through the sacrifice of his own son amen Amina that's why he says Be Justified by faitha you have to take it by faith if you take it by faith then he says we have peace with God if we take a justification when you say God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you get your peace foreign three things he reproves of righteousness then he distributes all the three outs he gives an independent scripture righteousness because they believe not on me amen so he rebukes the world because they believe not on him and because they don't belong they commit sins is what the yeah you are a Believer flips the scriptures to bring the condemnation to you [Music] that we have a high priest of our confession is black offered for your conditions that's where the holy spirit says don't put yourself into the state of sin come into the state of the righteousness of Jesus Christ foreign amen Amina so like if I can take him to Romans 5 1. therefore being justified by faith but why we're talking about have peace with God [Music] that's not where he's condemning him he's pushing you into it except you're right accept your sins to come and live his life away in your life foreign Romans 4 25 says who they live but for our offenses and he was raised again for our justifications so his resurrection is your righteous that's what the Holy Spirit convicts the believer accept your righteousness let the holy spirit amen amen so when the high priest for example walked into the holy of holies with the blood of sacrifice he was doing it for himself that was for the atonement but then when he came out praise the Lord when he came out let me tell you what happened the people were so happy that the blood of sacrifice has been accepted amen Amina that the blood of sacrifice has been accepted we could received and according to that question that people Rejoice Hallelujah we are free that's where the holy spirit is convicting that you have a sacrifice to represent you to present now you are not only forgiven you are Justified why can't we give the Lord foreign anything else that is the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us away from our sins the blood of Jesus Christ think of it that dripping blooded well um amen amen the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride yes sir she stands perfect unadulterated in the first place that's what the holy spirit is convicting you on this Easter morning by faith and once you take it myself that's your righteousness that's where the holy spirit is impressing you all right call yourself out of condemnation hallelujah praise God you are not supposed to be in the Judgment he says because the priests of the world [Music] Hallelujah so now here we are out praise God call yourself [Music] [Applause] he has no part in me Hallelujah on this Easter Sunday this is your righteousness foreign [Music] you know when we're growing up [Music] how many I know they are very sweet I know brother Fred there in the back but that one grew up in town might be brothers you know on this Easter Sunday in The Villages when they are going to church they would wave to one another is it true is he rose because of me if I'm not part of the picture that is two parties whose sin is taken away not given a total relationship amen amen let's go to Hebrews 9 14. he says the blood of Christ who are through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God your conscience the word here is actually the work of the bleach completely takes away the conscious [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] that's what Easter does amen I mean he said the old worshipers of the Old Testament but their hand put their hands upon us they took a hook please [Music] has died in his place but he went back out with the same desired when he came here you understand now because the life one problem the blood cells was animal life therefore it could not come back to the worship Hallelujah ladies removed the past but he walked out with the desire to do more foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] I'm not hearing that amen today praise the Lord that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first system they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance he met a tournament for the transgressions that were done under the Old Testament and then close this permanently and made us here Eternal inheritance I want you to understand one thing here from the
