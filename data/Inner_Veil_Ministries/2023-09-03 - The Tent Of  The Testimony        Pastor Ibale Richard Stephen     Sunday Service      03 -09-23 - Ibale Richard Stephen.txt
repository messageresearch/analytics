[Music] [Applause] you know brother Joshua is one of those people that are always standing here to lead in worship yes and you know when you're here there is uh a certain few back that you really want to feel from the people you don't speak to statues expect living beings praise the Lord you know they are expected to speak back to you so you know he was telling me Pastor can I say something about that you know it was his uh uh motivation to do that so we give him a few minutes you can come over so we allow him share his uh expressions because he ministers Among Us amen um you know he doesn't want to come here and sing without you yeah and he doesn't want to come here and sing when you are not really knowing what you're singing about yeah you're in buying God so he really feels good when you all join In Worship will you always join in that worship from the beginning of the service to the end of the service it is all a worship service amen amen it's not when the brother comes up here and says oh let us worship together but right from the time you step in here foreign foreign see by the time and this has been the burden of my heart and I pray that it also becomes your body because when we come to church like scripture says it we all bring our league so far so it doesn't start from the preaching of the word you know it when you stand here sometimes you can feel how the people and uh sometimes you feel when you are struggling through a service you're struggling because the prophet teaches us that come early to change why do we come Ali because many times we are rushing to come to church beginning to preach all through the week you haven't even listened to a sermon and these are the things that the prophet teaches us in the Bible say we should meditate yeah so you meditate through the week the pastors have always labor tell us at least pick a someone go and read Because when you come and the song service is starting maybe the Lord has inspired the song leader to go a certain way sometimes you come to church and and we are just seated we are not praying pray for the service pray for the songs that they will bless you and that they will also bless the service that that is the only way you're going to benefit from the gift that is going to come you have meditated through the week foreign [Music] and the prophet says you come expect him and you you get what you expect if you come believing that God is going to heal me in this service yeah people think we don't have the Holy Spirit he's here but which condition do we come in in the church it's it's something that we really need to think about because worshiping is not just close your eyes and you know singing slowly we are playing very nice music it comes from the heart what's the condition of your heart as you come in his presence the fountain is here it's it's here to wash you so when you step here step and wash yourself if there is any guilty staying wash it off so that when the song service starts and you can easily feel it from here where the people well the people pray you don't even ask the people to pray they just begin to pray so the question is what condition do you come in in the church have you come prayed up you come early this is scripture and I'm just encouraging us that we we should do these things because they will really help us a lot amen and then as the as the as the minister comes Nehemiah just flash for me that scripture Nehemiah chapter 8. I'll read it just quickly we'll read it while we are seated it says and Ezra describes stood Upon A palpit of wood which he had made for that purpose okay let me skip down to verse 5 and Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people is and when he opened it foreign that were actually um always done yeah when you read in the Old Testament every time that the word of God was to be presented in any case if you see the minister coming don't wait to be told because scripture tells us that is how we welcome the wife with gladness we welcome it by standing up and then the minister then comes to take over the service and preach the word so that has prayed so that has been waiting on the Lord so that has been meditating it has been part of the song service those are key things otherwise the minister has a very hard time preaching for the congregation that has not prayed up the congregation that has not read the world so it's my prayer that every time you see the minister is coming like the scripture says the people stand up in respect and to accept to receive the wine no quicker that is going to come to bless yourself this is a tradition in the Bible and I think we should embrace it we come to church empty it's really hard to break through so when we come and we operate up it will always help with the move of the Holy Spirit and you will see people delivered here you see people set free let the pastor do is [Applause] so we appreciate God foreign [Applause] foreign let's stand up and get to Numbers chapter 9. and verse 15. before we read let us just buy heads in our prayers Heavenly Father we come before your presence Lord with humility believing that the blood of Jesus Christ has made our way for us we want to dedicate ourselves to this service believing that you always speak to the election what your heavenly father speak to us this morning but Lord you may get into the depths of the world that Lord we may not starve in the midst of the Plenty that you have given us in the message give grace to the people that the inside teacher [Music] amen amen so Numbers chapter 9. and verse 15. let's see what the holy spirit says here amen amen 9 15 and on that day that the Tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the Tabernacles namely the tent of the testimony in other words is called the tent of the testimony and that even there was upon the Tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire engage foreign and when the cloud came down he did not die down until the morning may God bless the reading of the world so today I want to speak on the 10th of the testimony the tent of the testimony and you know here where do you know God has given us the grace that we present the word in today's gamble in a teaching format so we really need to follow so closely because if you miss me at one Junction I'm sure you'll get me at the second chance you don't need to stay around if you miss something and you are meditating on that and then you're left behind when you come to church there will always be your personal path right certainly when you come pray that your part will always be so this state of the testimonies the 10 of the testimony [Music] was built on a human specification yes so the layout of the temple had three chords there was the first court amen Amina this was the General Assembly place of all the circumcised Israel and then there was another cutter that divided there amen and beyond that was the middle court which was the religious Court where the priests performed their services amen so as one entered the holy there was such a great Bright Lights which was a testimony amen that God was in the camp of Israel so when the tattoo was the glory of God justified by a pillars and then the third was caught the tenth of the testimony he testified of his presence amen amen so when God is in the tents they will always be a testimony and the testimony is not what we say that is the testimony was the glory of God are you together with me and I've told you this stubbornness was built on a human specifications Soul spirit and body amen so this shows that God constructed us on the same premise amen we are under the same structures and that's why the scripture says knowing not that ye are the temp of God and that the spirit of God dwells in you when is the Tabernacle was the glory of God came over and when you become the Tabernacle of God the testimony will be the glory of God over here amen so when Ezekiel saw him himself you're welcome back to the house praise the Lord amen Amina he has got a very good testimony it was very short why won't people and I told Brother James to read it after the servants praise the Lord amen Amina so when exactly you saw him exactly when he was a ghost so when you see the pillars that's the glory that surrounds God amen amen so Ezekiel chapter one and verse 26 now Jeremiah is justifying what he saw that question he says and above the family that was over the four living creatures who was the likeness of the throne and the appearance of sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above a pony question describing God as he saw him so verse [Applause] as the appearance so far around about with it from the appearance of his life foreign foreign foreign this was the appearance the likeness of the glory of the Lord and I said the Lord was engulfed in that fire you see and that's the same fire that came forth in the prayer line when brother Branham was up there foreign amen Amina so and that's the same pillar as I said that went around in the ministry of brother the fire would have come over brother branham's heads as a testimony of the fourth film of the son of man amen amen so when God finds success at the tent of your body but Glory will just come and hover over here you may not understand but the glory of God will normally go around with it yourself traveled with my children sometimes but the people just offer you the respect even when you know they don't know you amen amen the other day was with my wife and we met this man guarding at us foreign that pillow fire goes around with you anyway you may not break into the dimensions that sees the spiritual world to see the pillars praise the Lord amen so we don't seek to produce good works we seek the Bucks that's all you need and everything else will work out by itself but you break your neck that I may turn away from this call for the glory of God that's what you need to calm down God's glory and once that Glory card he is establishing a testimony is pleased with you and when that Glory doesn't go away until the resurrection so when that Glory comes down foreign foreign [Applause] Hallelujah foreign the commitment out of Ezekiel died but he says incidentally I just find myself fell upon my face amen amen and then in that posture matriculation of humility the voice of God began to speak shall we receive the Holy Spirit to build a state of humility so that God will begin to speak to us if he wants us to remove the shoes amen not saying I will never do this again you will do it in the absence of the glory you have entered your rest God is responsible for everything that you do in your life praise the Lord [Music] he teaches us how to stand in his presence okay amen that's the glory of God we will teach you how to start we'll teach you how to love the brothers he will teach you how to love your words foreign [Music] see what I'm saying there must be the love of God that pulls upon your children amen he teaches us how to stand in his presence when that Glory came face to face with Daniel let us go to Daniel chapter 10. and we will see what happens for the man that were with me but a great quirking fell upon them so that they fled tried themselves you can never run away from the glory of God are you together you see there are some people that will run away from that Glory especially when God is lifting his foreign when God is coming down as a teacher preparing these people for the rain that's going to fall there are some people that will call it says amen they have the voice but when that Glory comes down to the voice of God to the word of God amen amen so therefore I was left alone amen the glory is only foreign [Music] of that Glory foreign he says my comedyness according to you I want to wear again meaning my beauty is my attractive my Majesty myself standing in the glory women the voice of his word and when I had the voice of his wife in a deep sleep on my face and my friends toward the ground which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my heart and brought him and to cause them to start yeah when the glory comes [Applause] Into Darkness so couldn't see because of that bright shining life it was a normal life sunlight was there but when that light came the light of the sun became darker Soul could not see nothing that's the glory of the Lord when he comes down he deems all the things of this world they become nothing before us before before nightclubs become worse football games It all becomes when he stands out there we pray that the glory of the Lord I'm not always stand in front of us so that everything of this world that's the goodness of the Lord in the righteousness amen Amina so in Acts chapter 9 verse another voice saying unto him yeah why prostitute us down and he said foreign even to fight what God is doing that's what show was doing let me eliminate Stephen always you understand what I mean dismantle this word that's what he thought he had the ability to do I tell you no man can stop what God started it carries the Glorious identity the voice is distinct to the elected amen are you together with me when this voice comes down even if he's fallen in the gutter a drunk man amen that voice there is distinct amen she could be looked at in the morning and that voice swings she will know that is my master praise the Lord he is foreign [Applause] hahaha praise the Lord and He trembling yeah what will you have me to do oh yes and the Lord said that to him going to the city and shall be told unto thee what thou must do and the Lord said that to him he teaches us hahaha are you together with him what is it tell your brother he teaches me how to stand up but you never get into this experience Until That Glory has come back I say sometimes you may think you are standing every seven years and you boss because you are better than brother so and so many were dogs when that Glory comes your comeliness comes to nothing then you learn to respect to the brothers amen amen look at Revelation 117. the testimony of John he says when I saw him I fell at his feet and he laid his right hand upon me yeah I am the first and the last tender glorious right hand um [Music] [Music] [Music] praise God foreign stand there foreign Sabha foreign foreign pray that Hunter is that's how we stand under the glory and we may never see the fire literally over our tents but the fruit of his presence will testify of his presence this man who stood outside here they did not know that in the Hall of holies there was the presence of the Lord this is [Music] when he presented you to the people I said yes I pray that the Lord may present me to the people amen praise God so that you may stand down maybe the testimony of the pillars there can never be a dry almond when he steps into that presence okay so the entire house amen has totally become a Wilderness under the body of Christ must Institute itself to bring up the fruit of the spirit because elsewhere it's a desert it's a Wilderness that are receiving the Reigns of the Holy Spirit foreign [Music] they'll come around and say how have you been able to bring up your children but you brought them into the presence for my soul and the pillars what's going around with them until they come to their maturity and the people they will come to you the healing of the nation those are the things that the world is dying of even they've been through every quittency the family is a scattering the children are on drugs amen amen you become a perfect influence like a John the Baptist Church because that's where the spiritual awareness is [Music] for the healing of the nation [Music] when the soldiers went to him he knew that they've got a chronic disease where the people are going to come to you Hallelujah Jesus he says you agree with him before he takes you to the judges because they are the prosecutors amen Amina we've got lawyers here you know what I'm talking about this is the man who man the testimony of conviction just agree with him that's their character that's their nature foreign amen which was replaced later foreign why right so that the prophets of haggai makes time because he was speaking about a coming temples he says the glory of this letter house shall be greater than the former so is the Lord of hosts in this place will I give peace says the Lord Of Us in what place which fortune in this greater give peace all these other temples were in them amen but they were scared of the enemy I died he would come anytime in the time of Eli because he was always fighting every day to keep away the enemies from the kingdom welcome back now look at the one of Solomon only yes the Babylonians are you together but then when they did it was also now thought to be not perfect so they brought the herodian temple in 87. promise you are in the greater glory amen can we give the Lord the under pressure to say thank you for making me that Temple because you understand what I mean these 10 point prophecy is the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ through the seven churches [Applause] [Applause] so the holy city foreign what a temple we are making yeah you are that Temple not bed with hearts that will carry the glory of God upon her and that glory is [Music] so this Glory correctly what you know if he says it never left you the money but then at the end of it in the morning of the Resurrection when I mean at the end of it amen Amina this Glory here foreign it's going to be yakuba a permanent presence and then John says in that City there will be no need for the sun because the son himself where we shall love charity to bond us together we've been going from glorious Glory but soon amen we know it will be right in the glory and in his glory we shall say so this Glory comes because through the seven churches the fruit has been packing in the very Life of Christ what's happening there praise the Lord amen amen so he has been packing us with that Glory because he packs in the faith of Jesus Christ he backs in the body of Jesus Christ he packs in that knowledge of Jesus Christ he packs in the tempers of Jesus Christ of Jesus Christ and then charity comes and dwells as the glory over us and when he does Look what comes through foreign [Applause] foreign they come from therefore they come by that to seek for the sun that's wisdom magazine and Solomon says wisdom has builded our house Seven Pillars stands out here talking about the wisdom of revelation God helped him build her house is not speaking as a man is not speaking as a male is not speaking he's speaking as a feminine has built her house amen so he refreshed himself in the feminine because the spirit of wisdom is the spirit of God Amen that God who gave his pride through the seventh Church amen amen she has killed her peace [Applause] she has also furnished her table at the finishing of this house at the seventh Church she will be under an ego anointing that's why Solomon is that she has killed her beasts are you together praise the Lord she goes into the word with the Precision and she will catch Revelation are you together foreign busy get the message she has you know killed that peace she goes into the depth of the world Hallelujah I tell you when you see this Eagle he's very bored when he comes please foreign [Music] [Music] that we have now she has killed her Beast she goes into the message you can become very proud for discovering something which is given to you not depending on what your place amen Amina she's feeding on the depth of Revelation and she has also means foreign [Music] foreign [Music] and then gets up there he knows what to do he finds the Rock and onion was released then he comes has no respect for a snake even if it's a cobra you know one time we shall come and show the nature of money he comes down straight putting yeah he'll bruise and then goes up there with it when it goes to the Rock are you a ghost this morning you must learn to kill your beasts amen so Proverbs right now listen he says whose soul is simple aquarity Italian but it's so simple magazine [Music] who is so simple let him turn yourself as for him that wanted understanding she says to him so Solomon is saying here who so is simple according to you let him come to the unveiling of Christ foreign in bringing the best in the preaching of the Seven Seals he begins with simplistic God in his simplest praise the Lord amen he starts on God in simplest so now we are talking about the latter house we are that house we at the tent of testimony and the glory of the Lord amen Amina that is the house amen so the world currency will see that light over you saw the light over the Tabernacle foreign that's what it is Matthew chapter five and verse 14. you are the light um when the light came over the Tabernacles and says look at the god of Israel is a bright shining light Hallelujah and when Israel went out eating Nation upon Nations [Applause] because the gods that were with Israel in the wilderness has come against us Hallelujah just receive that and all your fears amen amen so the way you remember the way the candles were leaders because when you are the light of the world remind you about how these candles will lead each other they picked the fire battle from the Holy Father and then they lit this candle and this kind of after it was the seven candles when you got your understanding of the Southern charges [Music] was the light of the next foreign that's the fire which we receive that's how the candles have been lighted that's why I tell you my brothers you need to become a bright candle but you may become a source of influence of the Brethren around here you become a tent of witnesses praise the Lord tell your brothers you are not going to be healed because you are the testimony in your place because they can't produce that's why the criticize not because they hate you but because they are jealous the Nations they knew that God the Philistines don't care about the future God will take care of them you just keep burning amen amen so his life becomes our life and he's righteousness we are here and this dedication was not a religious ceremony but the coming down of the glory of God when they went through and they tested the ceremonies amen Amina you know what happened the glory of God came down and shut down the preachers [Music] praise the Lord are you together with me when the glory of God comes down in its Majesty it is going to shut us down God himself will attack his ministers why have you deceived in the Holy Ghost so when it comes to the ministry God's law foreign no no let the testimony be seen to be in you the fruit of the spirit should be said the life of Christopher brother and the Holy Ghost is a positive token but your lamb died and you received the token upon yourself for his real life is in you there's no make believe there's no put on there's no impersonation the world knows that talking is a positive died and he was carrying his cross foreign not that the pastor preaches but there is a Revelations but the lamb that your father knows and brings you too cannot release foreign [Music] amen amen so then you said brother Stephen could do this yes so Romans 9 27. Isaiah also Christ concerning Israel is the number of children of Israel be as the son of sea is [Music] so there is a church natural that's Israel Israel and it's a modern how God is complete his work among the Gentiles so Israel is our timetable keep looking at them and we can know what time it is he says in verse 28. he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work when the Lord make upon the Earth is speaking not about Israel but the same application is used on the Gentile church are you together with him God wants to do a quick walk upon his brother but the question is how does he do it to complete and release the glory you have turn around and tell your brother I'm the Tabernacle of the Living God are you the Tabernacle of the Living God rejoicing it is foreign [Music] [Music] amen amen we apart of this quick work so what does that bride do okay to become that brings down the glory what must I do the answer is simple Mission going down which wisdom has built a magazine so you cannot enter yourself into the holy of holies how this happens are you together with me I told you that the Tabernacles is built on the specification of a man we are soul on this is and then we are Flesh on the outside Guru [Music] saw you at the temple okay now the Bible teaches us but it is did you hear that oh he did so what do I do to become a red Tabernacle yeah you do nothing you just have to be there to the high priest Christ the high priests Wonder yeah the temple it was just a new house we need to go and uh that's what the people are teaching on the bathroom of the holidays and the people bang at their heads on the walls they are looking for the holidays tattoo are you together with me what is it so you only need to present yourself for the holy priests are you together with me what is it just submit when there is the service be there when there's the church programs foreign boom boom because when they are going to school they kick with them you keep seeing them they are in the spirit they've allowed something go to the center Vikings another thing is the temple had to be in existence do you know why you're here at least every one of us has a testimony that the high priest has entered the first court that's why you're here keep your doors open when he finishes work on the outside he'll go into the middle course then keep patients when he finishes with you he enters into the song there is no emotions the Holy Ghost doesn't come to your flesh he goes into the holy of holies and in there there are no physical Sensations does not have Sensations see when you find people in the church they are kicking tables they are doing everything because the Holy Ghost is coming from Amazon if the Holy Ghost baptize the outward um it could be possible and that's what brother Branham says this Holy Spirit on the flesh it's possible they will kick around but they cannot produce and yes I think you are supposed to be the tent of testimony so he gets in the first Court brother Branham says everything notice this you know justification sanctification the bathroom let me illustrate it I'm down here I'm walking this way and after a while something speaks to me and nothing can turn me but God what is meaning Japanese is that I'm going this way and God speaks to me amen Amina I'm tired this way now when I turn around that is my justification I mean that's what you say how many of you have time to yourself you don't enjoy night clubs I don't mean you never go you may have the weakness but that's not your desire [Music] [Applause] you are not wasting time everything you are now come to the person of the word amen now when you've come down here why did I know and the word begins to work on your life and you begin to throw certain things because of the word that's what we call sanctification foreign so each time you come here you are coming to yourself when you fight the word says you are fighting the waters I don't need that water because that's the only way energy God sent John Wesley with the message of sanctification the cleanliness [Music] with holiness are you together so that's the middle court you know you write that that's where the candle's way that will lead and that was a natural life but good enough to start showing you your debts because you are no longer in the world you are not in that Perfect Light here but you are in that sanctifying life it's bright enough to show you the better areas Lord help me I've not totally committed myself to yourself amen it is in the middle I got who was one of the greatest footballers in the history of this country his name was the circle they used to call him he was so strong he could play all the games in the for his it never happened again so I was justifying to his wife I mean to his wife with my wife and she said come on what you have told him is right [Music] like she should not go to the night club foreign now one day she said I don't know what happened no people came and told me these things like some angels we're carrying people I'm throwing them in very heavy fires and then I started screaming because they had to come to me and then I woke up laughs see Science Education is the work of God himself just open up allow him to do a work in you and after the you know high priest has finishes work in the middle course then he has to enter into the holy of holies listen here this is whether we have our message foreign I want you to know that you are here and you already know because the high priest entered your first court you were Justified and you lost love of the things of the world you don't just gladly go in there anymore and now after that you come to a point where are your spirits begins to be convicted when you feel there is something wrong in your life you apply the washing Waters of the world that's your middle card then after that the Holy Spirit has to enter into the holy of holies now if you are a Sin Gene of God that's where your seed dwells against you may have never known that because you bypass your fearfulness but at this time he comes on the inside to make you know who you are [Applause] Divine
