word [Music] shall be and all will be [Music] well then go and become better people not better for the world but become better in the word amen being transformed anded children and ConEd to be like Jesus amen amen so we've read in the first chapter of Genesis in the beginning when God created heaven and the Earth upon the face of the Earth amen leared and when he looked when he looked he saw that it was beautiful praise the Lord then he separated each one of them and he put all things in order praise the Lord doing when he spoke the word was transforming praise the Lord the element which he spoke to conform to what was in his thoughts he had thought how things should be he had a thought how the Earth should look like the thought creating a garden praise the Lord whatever he spoke he spoke to transform into existence what was in his thoughts so we see the power of transformation and that this power works by a certain Factor praise the Lord because when God spoke to the waters if the waters did not hear the voice of the spoken word and obeyed to it Waters would not separate and when he spoke to Darkness Darkness heard it the voice of the spoken word I did not obey not be moved everything would a mess but we see that whatever he spoke to it obeyed the voice of God praise the Lord factor of obedience and total subjection total surrender total obedience the spoken what that toal obedience transformed things and it ConEd them to the mind that God had praise the living and the scripture tells us in the Book of Romans 12 verse 1 verse I you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable sacri and be not conformed to this world but be yet transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so now this is the desire of God that we be not conformed to this world but that we be transformed in other words that we align [Music] ourselves with Godly virtues to have a change of [Music] mind to have a change of nature to have a change of nature to be changed praise the Lord by the renewing of our minds praise the name Living God that we may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God praise the Lord so the desire of God is that we be transformed praise the lord we be transformed to the mind of God we be transformed praise the Lord by the word of God so we may be perfect praise the Lord and then present ourselves acceptable which is according to his perfect will now we see that back then when he spoke the word and he spoke to the mountain and he spoke the he spoke to the stars and the mo and the rest of them when they heard the voice of God when they heard that God wanted them to be transformed to be changed to be conformed to his mind they all obeyed the voice of God praise the Lord and they were all transformed by the word of God and by obedience they were all put to order so we see that we are transformed by our obedience to the word of God we are transformed when we hear the voice of the spoken words when we receive the words praise the Lord and when we accept it by obedience settles in our hearts and then it begins to do the work of transformation to transform Us Praise the Lord to transform us to change our nature to change our thoughts change our mind align to the mind of God praise the Lord and as we notice in Genesis when the Heaven and Earth all the things that were there heard the voice and they obeyed it regardless of how long it took there was a transformation that took place there praise the Lord so now it all what matters here obedience to that voice when they obeyed it regardless of how long it took but the Bible tells us took six days and we know that one day like a thousand years so now we know it took 6,000 years for all those things to be transformed and be set in order regardless of how many years it took as long as there was OB it begins to change our nature change our lives praise the Lord it begins to transform us more points of weakness it drives our way point areas of weakness the more you subject yourself to the word of God the more you become obedience to the voice of the word word transforms you prise the Lord you may not reach where you want to be in in the space of an hour you may have weakness when you believe the word of God the day you believe found with weaknesses and you prayed asked God to change you praise the Lord be obedient subject yourself to the word shall certainly transform you why because it is in his mind presents Us Praise the Lord as a perfect sacrifice he presents us as a bride that is Holy and has no blemish him praise the Lord so the transformation process begin at the time when we hear the voice and obey the voice of he begins now the work prise the Lord he begins the work and the more you keep yourself the word the more you keep yourself in his presence he transforms you praise the Lord he changes you praise the Lord you may not be perfect today but you are not what you are yesterday suddenly there is a transformation is taking place in your life praise the Lord and the purpose of this transformation you praise the Lord the image of God because the Bible says that when he was done creating the Heaven and the Earth and all the things that are in he then said let us create man in our own image praise the Lord so he created man in his own image and now when man fa the desire of God he he gets this man he transforms him he changes him to conform him to the original image of God praise the Lord so how do we get there keep obeying praise the Lord I will Stillen it to the SE that goes into the ground this seed when it goes to the ground it does not want to remain there it must bear fruits praise the Lord it does not want to live alone it wants to Bear other fruits have more seeds around it in order for it to Bear it must first of all be thrown down the ground and it must die the seed must first of all die and how does it die it must come into subject the conditions of the ground in order for it praise the Lord around three three or four weeks ago SP about this seat that this seed has a life on theide of it praise the Lord but it has a support system around support system protects that that seat life of the SE praise the Lord so when it is burried in the ground it must accommodate it must subject it must obey the conditions of the ground in order praise the Lord for the body to Die the body of this SE must first of all die in order for the SE to manifest it life praise the Lord and the conditions may become tough but the body of the seed has to Bear it must bear the heat it has to die in order to produce life praise the Lord so now our lives can only receive a of Our Lives a transformation a transformation of our body when we allow the conditions of the word to operate in our lives praise the lord we read about the par of the S when goes out he gets his seats and he throws them out only those seats fall in good ground praise the Lord have the opportunity to germinate and grow and bring forth fruits praise the Lord but those seats that fall on a bad ground those that fell by the way sight those that fell on the Rocks those that fell in grounds they don't have the opportunity to grow up but we thank God that we are the seed that has been thrown on good ground we have been planted on good ground which is the word of God so we allow the word of God Work Upon Our Lives and only the word of God change us when we obey it get subjection the leadership of the world when we get in there then our bodies the Shar the sh begins to die and when it begins to die it gives way for the life for us to survive praise the Lord but God gives us strength through his word be during that process of transformation sing us from one bit to another from this weakness changes us he drives it out from this character he takes it out praise the Lord and throughout that process he gives us the grace praise the Lord he gives us that sufficient Grace see the prophet was speaking about a child being formed in the womb and he said the moment the Lord the baby began to be formed in the womb of Mary persecution set in the Lord that's when Joseph rejected his praise the Lord that's when the community began to question her character the baby was formed when Jesus is born in our life praise the Lord that transformation is so tough sometimes we Face rejection praise the lord we Face rejection we get into a moment of persecution is a transformation moment trying to change you to move you from that position to place you and position in his words during that persecution he gives us the grace to Bear the moments of pers he says I know that you have a little strength level the church when he was speaking chur at Philadelphia he says these things say he that is Holy he that is true he that has the Key of David he that opens and no man shuts and shut no man opens praise the Lord he says these words speaks he has the key that when he opens when he calls you when he speaks out praise the Lord when the spoken word go for you hear it when you receive it and when you open the door no man can shut the Lord he opens the door he says come in says no man can shut when you come and he shuts it there's no amount of pressure there no amount of persecution that can open that door for he allows you to come in come in the word and he locks and he locks himself in he begins to transform you to conform you his own likeness say I know your Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it thou has a little strength that's Revelations 3 verse 8 it says I know your works that thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word the word which you have received you you have obeyed the voice of you have been obedience you have yielded yourself the leadership of the spoken one he says I know you have a little strength and that little strength you have kept my words and you have not denied my you have a little strength to keep my words to obey my words upon my word upon the word of God it will strengthen you in those moments of Rejection it will work upon you it will renew your strength when your strength is running out it will renew your mind it will transform you praise the Lord I know that you have a little strength praise the Lord that moment of when the word has been rejected says I know that you have a little strength and you have not rejected my name you have not denied my name but you have stood by my name you have walked by my name behold I have the key and I'll open the door for you no man can shut praise the Lord so he says you have a little strength that was the only Beacon of Hope it was the only beon of hope that was left to the church the little strength left of the church by that Jesus says I know and I have opened the door and left it open and no man can shut so that you will come in and you keep coming in regardless of how hard you've been hit you keep coming in you keep walking in when the doors are open when the church doors are open you have the desire there is that little strength that small desire to come before God come and speak to the Lord come and pour yourself out there is that small desire left behold I open the door and as long as that small desire is in there no will shut the door keep coming in keep coming in keep walking in Praise the Lord you put yourself out there and you seek his face and you'll be found of him is open and the grace is free and sufficient and with that little strength rise up rise up come confess confess your faults praise the Lord confess your weaknesses put yourself right obey The Voice come in he will receive and transform you praise the Lord I have an open door is full of forgiveness have an open door it is full of strength you come in and I'll give you strength to transform you because his desire is not leave you in your condition of Life desire not leave us in our condition of life is to work Upon Us transform us and conform us his children to be like Jesus he says I have set an Open Door in other words I have set an open book to fill up your emptiness praise the Lord I have an open book read it to renew your fa minde you read The Words which is the open book the open door to transform your mind to trans you to change your and to give you his strength to keep walking in say you have a little strength and you Haven denied my name hold onto that little light and declare the name of the Lord that little light has the power to transform you to change you into Sons Daughters of God to conform us to the image of God to bring us to Perfection that's how we get into our Perfection is by the renewing of our minds through the word of God which has the transforming power praise the Lord that's all we want by the transformation of God Spirit by his word that's all we want to be transformed the will of God praise the Lord to be perfect be changed praise the Lord into his Perfect Image because what Christ is coming for is coming for a church that has got his life he coming for a church praise the Lord that is full of his life a church that has eaten the word that has taken up the book and that has eaten the book praise the Lord a church which the book has transformed his own likeness praise the Lord because he coming for a bright and the Bible tells us in the Book of Genesis that when God wanted to make for Adam a bright he never created a BRI from outside he looked at Adam and he got a part of him and out of him he created a bright and then woke up and he saw her praise the Lord she called him a woman who was a part of him a b of his b and flesh of his flesh so she was like himing his life because she came out of him so when Jesus is coming back is bright it must be a church that is like him praise the Lord it must be a church has been conformed to the nature of Jesus Christ that is like Jesus praise the Lord he's not coming for a church that has accepted but not transformed when you accept the word you must obey the word transform you until the image of God praise the Lord so you don't accept and then you walk out you must live by the you must walk by the words you must stay by the words Lord you must be conformed by the word to be conformed to the life of God and so the prophet says that's all that we all want to have the mind of Christ to have the mind that was in Christ that we may be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God Spirit by his word that should be our motive to be transformed daily praise the lord we must be ready to be transformed daily praise the Lord you cannot stand say I am perfect praise the Lord because if you are perfect he have no reason to be here but he's working on us transforming us is changing us to be perfect like him praise the Lord and when we be perfect like Jesus then he will come to take us home because his purpose is to change us to be like him be perfect so we should accept and allow the word of God to work on our lives transform us daily like Paul cried out he cried to be transformed daily and said I Must Die daily for myself to allow the transforming power of God to transform me and drive out all the elements of the Flesh and the desires of the flesh that are always at war with my spirit praise the Lord he said when I try to do good when I find myself and I think I have become perfect I find myself doing wrong praise the Lord when the word of caution put you right with God accept and Obey praise the Lord even if it is so hard for you you accept and Obey and allow God to take his cause to transform you to make you obedience to align you with his words praise the Lord Die daily of all your fears to Die daily of all your fears praise the Lord the fear to present yourself as a Christian as a Believer as a child of God before the rest of the world before the rest of the world praise the Lord you die daily praise the Lord you have proclaimed my word regardless of the situation persecution you mention the word of Jesus they deny you from speaking about it you speak about him because you know that he has the transforming power praise the Lord to transform you and he says I open the door and no man can shut not ashamed has opened the door for you and you have come to knowledge of the word of God asham speak about Jesus in the Dark Ages prise the Lord there were men and women who are not ashamed to speak about the name of the Lord praise the Lord they were beaten some of them the women those that stood by the word of God and left their hair to grow their hair was was set a bless they set fire on their and they were burned but they never rejected they were not ashamed of the name of the Lord praise the Lord and now there was a man the prophet talks about in that message the Masterpiece he says there was a man who wrote and says but where is that God that was very silent when his people were subjected to all that humiliation all the torture that God was present with them that God is present with you in your dark moments of life in your moment of persecution that God is present with you praise the Lord and he says I have a crown for you because you have not rejected my name you have not denied my name keep the name of the Lord and keep that little strength praise the Lord because the goal of every believer accepted Christ is to be like him is to talk like him is to walk like praise the Lord is to be lost yourself and allow him to be become blind to and thees of yourself to allow the person of Christ to dwell in there so he can transform you to be like him that's our desire and the prophet says now that's what we are here for that's my message has been all along is the word of God we must hold to that regardless of what others other things take place always stay with that word always check out your motives and objectives if it is according to the word of God if it isn't leave it alone if it is with the word of God and lines up with the word of God hold to that praise the Lord amen hold to that shake your life check your motives check your character check your speech he says if it is not aligning the word of God As a Christian as aie who has received the word praise the Lord leave it and only hold onto the word why because the word has the power and ability to transform you it will transform your mind your mind has a thinking align with the mind of God the word of God trans praise the Lord that's why message and what you have asked for has not been given to you praise the Lord you will not C God you will love him more and you will know that is not in his perfect will to give you what youve asked for but as long as in love with him you being transformed and your life aligns the word of God praise the Lord when you ask something and has not been given you will know is not in the will of God why because the Christian of every Christian to live the will of God that's why when Jesus told us say when you pray you pray for the will of God to not our own will why because our will may not align with the word of God but his will aligns with his own when you ask for the will of God to praise the Lord it shall surely be because he only wishes good things for us the Bible says God is Not unjust that he allows you to be tempted to be beyond that you cannot Lord he is not unjust that he has not called you to get into his word to align with his word he has not transformed you to leave you there to be beyond your strength every trial that comes God gives you the strength praise the Lord to overcome it he gives you the strength sometimes it may take too long but it is in his own will be patient with and allow his word all his will to be it may take but certainly it shall come to pass praise the Lord that's how he transforms by his spoken words because he spoke his word and when he spoke his word he does not go back void praise the Lord he spoke his word he accept his word and you live by his word and walk by his word Pray by his word mated to give his word so let's live by the word of God let's be guided by the word of God let our souls Beed by the word of gods don't leave it and seek the will of God praise the lord we must walk by the word of God we must walk in the spirit in Galatians 5 verse 16 this I said then 516 this I said then walk in the spirit and shall not fulfill the last of the flesh walk in the spirit how you walk in the spirit praise the Lord how do you walk in the spirit by walking by the word of God praise the Lord obedience to the word praise the Lord meditating the word of God living by the word of God prise the Lord we can be able to walk in the spirit because the word of God keep us in the spirit of God praise the Lord so when you walk by the word by the word you are able to walk in the spirit praise the Lord and by the word when the flesh begins to walk to Walk praise the Lord when raes a war against the spirit it may be your own flesh praise the Lord or it may be the people around it may be situations they begin to walk against the spirit praise the Lord by the word of God established in the word by the word of God the courage you are guided praise the Lord you read about PA and say PA says he was a per then he reached the time and said I have walked praise the Lord says but in my walk I have a few things in my body praise the Lord when I am trying to the will of God my body is Waring against praise the Lord and what did he do he never walked out because of wrong praise the Lord he never said I'm tired striving every day to do good and the tired let me walk out stay right there and he cried out and says so God I have a will in me to do good but again my body is always fighting against me bringing me down every day and he cried out and says oh what person Am I who shall deliver me from this body and he cried out to God to give him strength praise the Lord and the Bible says when he cried out God said unto him my strength is sufficient for you my strength is sufficient for you that little strength that you have that little faith that you have God says it is sufficient rise up and get established in the words get back to the words walk by the word confess the word speak about the word meditate upon the word my grace is sufficient for you praise the Lord and that grace shall transform you shall change you until you become perfect praise the Lord so when you get into your moments of weakness praise the Lord don't sh away from the word don't sh away from God get back to God if you still have that desire for God speak to him right back to him and tell him of your weaknesses and tell him of your difficulties streng which is his strength because it's not your strength the faith that we have is given of us freely of Jesus Christ so even that little strength says that small strength is that sufficient for me rise up and walk the that's what did he rose up and that's why he said for me to live praise the Lord I Have To Die daily that's why he had to Die daily he had to repent he had speak to him tell him his weakness and when he told him of his weakness the grace was already sufficient Grace was sufficient was already sufficient that's why he says when you are weak praise the Lord that's when you are strong because the moment you realize that you are weak praise the Lord that means you've looked at the words and you have put yourself at the balance and you found yourself wanting praise the Lord you found yourself underway in light of the word so now you feel you are weak and because you feel you are weak beginning for more of that is your moment of strength praise the Lord your moment of strength is when you on the Flat Road but your of strength is exhibited in your moments of law it manest at those moments of Life why you are able to know that you need more of God you canot live on your own praise the Lord that's the moment when you surrender that's the moment God wants when you surrender and on yourself you feel you cannot then he comes in and he takes the will gives you the strength he transforms you he changes you he gets you from that level he takes you to his level praise the Lord he said unto me my grace is sufficient for you and my power my strength is made perfect in your weakness praise the Lord and how did know when he measured himself he weighed himself in light of the word of God so what do we have our anchor praise the Lord the word of God our anchor is in the word of God praise the Lord when the storms have come hit you the other side it is the anchor praise the Lord that keeps you strong standing if you stand on your own you will fail if you stand on your own you will fa if you stand by the word of God and you get into the spirit of God praise the Lord he anchors you in his word he's transforming us he's working on us every day to make us better Christians until we come to a point when we are like him our desire is to be like him praise the Lord be transformed and conformed to the image of God but how how are the heavens and the Earth that were all mixed up all there how they put to order obedience to that spoken word transform how will I be transformed by obedience to the word of God how will I be transformed by living by the word of how will I be conformed into the image of God by dying daily to myself to allow God and the spirit of God to live praise the Lord the and all the Els theyey the spoken praise the Lord when they obeyed the Earth got stuck in there the Earth got stuck in theit the earth got stuck praise the Lord into theit praise the Lord and the son got standing the son also got standing praise the Lord and the rest of the galaxies they all went into plac the Stars the moon when they obeyed that voice they went and were position in their places when you obey the voice when you li The Voice you get position in the word of God and when you get position anchors your soul praise the Lord he transforms your soul and when he transforms your soul he wants to make you a better person better than you were yesterday praise the Lord he wants make you a better person we want make ourselves why because his will is to make us a perfect like the Lord if the will of God put us in order make us perfect praise the Lord us Our obligation is obedience Our obligation is obey the word of our Our obligation just and walk by his word he shall transform you praise the lord we may look at our s and judge ourselves praise the Lord but he knows that he is working on you is working on meise the Lord it is taking longer in his own time praise the Lord he transforms us and he shall make us a better person he shall make us perfect in his own image we got weaknesses and usually these weaknesses stand in the way of the world but if we can only obey the word it has the ability cleans all these SPS and to transform our minds the mind of Christ take away all weakness May stand in the way of the word and then this wordforms us his likeness praise the Lord his word that is born in our lives that is born in our thens us children born born in the image and likeness of God praise then Living God you have a little strength by that strength the Lord he shall work on us he shall transform us and we know that someday we shall not only be transformed we shall only be conformed praise the Lord but we shall be taken to be where he is praise the Lord when Jesus was leaving he left us with the Covenant he says I go to prepare a place for you and when he had gone prepare a place for us he sends us his holy spirit send us his word to guide us to change us to transform us to conform us onto his own image to make us ready that when he comes back we are ready to go with him praise the Lord so this word of God not only did not only transform praise the Lord the beginning of creation but also has the power to transform Us Praise the Lord and conform us theage of God praise the Lord and when we are confirmed when we are confirmed praise the Lord children praise the Lord when we are transformed and conformed you begin to think like him praise the Lord you become dead of yourself and you become dead of your desires sometimes you may not understand yourself people only who are like be able to understand you because you are like a pregnant woman those mothers when they conceive their life begins to change praise the Lord and they do not have power over the changes that are taking place in their lives there is something strange something new that has been born in their lives praise the Lord and as this thing keeps growing
