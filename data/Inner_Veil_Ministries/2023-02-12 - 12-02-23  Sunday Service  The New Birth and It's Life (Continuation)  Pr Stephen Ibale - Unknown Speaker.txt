foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] which we are born he says born by the word of God is he stepped away she didn't ever from the life that the word gives each gamble which Gaba and he stepped out of it yet once you step away from the world Robert gamble you die Oliver offer the only level you can be given life is to take the life behind that to us to come back into your position

then migrate under which I sent amongst there was a practical expression of what happens when you step away from the world it was in the time now there is what happened there that they are foreign flowing through you foreign are you together with the men one is it so the Palmer one uh [Music] it's away the fruit and all the fruit is eaten it is immediately it was eaten the fruit and it looks and there is nothing more to eat then it changes and changes the appetite and it becomes the locus it's not that lives away when it says there's no more leaves it changes this nature with the back of the tree completely and afterwards if the back is fully eaten away it changes and it begins to suck the life out of the back and when they saw it it was a complete dead tree um are you together with me it was dry but he says I'll restore this tree represents the weather never does if first of all eats away the fruit The Love Is Your Peace you are easily irritated you're not the fruit of the spirituality and the moment the fruit of the spirit is in dangerous [Music] you begin to disappear from church those are effects I'm the foundation of the world who is our I will restore because if you were known of God restless back in the roots the life retreated in The Roots but God promised I can't understand you may not be feeling the kind of feeling of the newborn foreign for messengers of righteousness are you together the church was destroyed by four Banks but again it takes foreign I got it right down here no that means that my name is ezekiel's Dry Bones come through life not when the snooze skin was on them but when the wind bloweth upon them come back that fourth messenger of life which is the spirit the person himself are you together with me the fourth message of life is not just an anointing but the person of the word himself being born again but by the incorruption is foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] are here together so the light begins to shine they cannot be fruits are you taking the light the fourth message of life to ripen your fruits because the Harvest is coming soon foreign amen Amina an invisible universe made visible foreign the reason that lies on the inside Munda shows also on the outside whatever lies here from the inside let me show them and then you eat water that's the life on this but when the Holy Ghost is on the inside he shows on the outside are you together with me the life that behind the blood evidently displayed on the outer door amen the blood was put on the house it is will be a former fellowship with a form of sweetness that was to build heaven and not to destroyed positive effects you as they leave meaning that once you in Christ you don't start tofuba you love your wife you love your family you love the Brotherhood you grow up amen amen they are born again and their lives begin to ship like a baby it's transformed and begins to grow candy you know it's okay already here they

statement yeah foreign we are not born to die we are burning dreams I want to grow turn around I want to grow praise the Lord amen amen now the prophet says this is very interesting your adoption of your blessings you don't adopt a baby he has to grow man I know we are born and raised to be blessed doesn't matter who you are in the body if you feel you got a gift to sing then you must know that you are supposed to grow into original to a blessing you don't just come here pray that we don't know to sing nice voices [Music] you know here's what I'm trying to get you too for this day we were predestinated unto adoption we were born here amen by the bathroom but after that God wants to see us here we've taken our positions [Music] foreign [Applause] amen amen okay got it listen to this who is that you know now this is what Hearts pentecostalito they say I got born again praise the Lord go to the Holy Ghost you are a child of God that's right but yet that ain't what I'm talking about we were predestinated but you don't have to remain a baby you are born your father doesn't have temper your father is not a liar are you together your father doesn't enjoy nightlife so you are growing manifest the Lord you don't give birth to a child and the guest started there um you cannot walk alone that's not what God is think like our father do things like our father that's blessing that's the father having hair galinda um led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Sons are born and led by the spirit born very well and led into character mode that gives us the nature of our father somebody verse 15. he says he have received the spirit of adoption where we cry yeah foreign [Music] this is the same minority again that Christ receives on the Jordan Riverside [Music] together with him he was not the spirit I mean he was not the spirit of fear he says we receive not the spirit of fear according because there was a Janet work between the Jordan River and the amount of transference depend on the spirit of the fear you have to be given the spirit of adaptation going through those foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign you have not received the spirit of fearful you've received the spirit of both to throw away the Fashions of the world are you together the spirit of bodiness you go to the shop I will not take it see that's what like you know is the spiritual born I'm going to stand out there as a daughter of God you've not received the spirit of fear simply because you've never had a dress before you always had trousers and it becomes a happiness amen amen if you and your destiny everyone God deals with you as we decide for what son is he whom the father yes we no longer have our own mind it's the mind of the father the faith of Jesus quick is the quietest Christian knowledge of Jesus Christ too amen I mean you see the temperance of Jesus Christ you are born again God sent this message amen Amina that's the number yeah when a dog drops Bible a dog drops that little dog has the life of a dog and it grows towards the image of his spirit he can never behave like a person that brings us to inheritance did you hear what I say you cannot be unborn you cannot become Seeker unless you've been born together the only reason why you can behave is coming to manifestation I want to come up of what we are here amen I mean we become heirs to a nature to focus in the nature of the father we become yes that's what we are out foreign foreign so adoption means that the Inner Man together [Music] this is how God looks you need to have a revelation not like the boy the prophet speaks of thing amen who is Mother educated and went to the far country amen and then while he was there he was sending some checks to the mother some chicks
