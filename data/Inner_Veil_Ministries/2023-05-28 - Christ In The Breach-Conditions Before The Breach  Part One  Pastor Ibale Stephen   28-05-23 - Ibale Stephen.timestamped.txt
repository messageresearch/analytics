[34:56] amen amen so uh we just want to give
[35:01] thanks for the service today
[35:04] let's go to
[35:08] the reading of the word gambo
[35:11] our scripture
[35:19] on the bridge
[35:26] Revelation chapter 4 verse 1.
[35:32] after this
[35:35] I looked and behold the door was opened
[35:38] in heaven
[35:41] [Music]
[35:43] and the first voice which I heard was as
[35:46] it were of the trumpet talking with me
[35:48] neither was in Ahsoka leader
[35:53] which side come up here
[35:57] and I'll show the things which must be
[36:00] Hereafter nange
[36:04] and immediately I was in the spirit
[36:09] and behold the throne was set in heaven
[36:15] and the one sat on the throne
[36:23] we thank you for this opportunity again
[36:27] to come before you as a teacher
[36:31] I pray father that you may take your
[36:34] word
[36:35] and teach it to our hearts
[36:38] and story to the bottom of our hearts
[36:42] because
[37:29] in Jesus name
[37:31] amen amen
[37:35] so today
[37:37] I'm going to
[37:40] do a small job
[37:45] and I trust that the Lord will be
[37:47] gracious to us
[37:50] as we do what we are going to do today
[37:55] amen amen I'm going to speak on the
[37:58] simple subject
[38:00] [Music]
[38:02] Christ in the bridge christendo
[38:05] the conditions before the bridge
[38:10] because we are going on with the Bridge
[38:13] series
[38:15] but today we deal with the conditions
[38:19] that really led to the bridge
[38:23] so the conditions before the bridge now
[38:28] verse 2 of I mean verse 1 of the
[38:32] scripture we read
[38:34] it says after this I looked
[38:39] where is the statement after this
[38:44] then you should always go back
[38:47] and see what the scripture would have
[38:50] been referring to
[38:52] get without which you cannot comprehend
[38:56] what's going to be said
[39:00] so since Revelation chapter four and
[39:02] five
[39:05] is the bridge then Revelation three
[39:09] should be the conditions that led to the
[39:13] bridge
[39:19] the condition that led to the bridge
[39:25] that's what causes that statement
[39:41] that those two chapters
[39:44] you know
[39:46] uh causes us to understand exactly what
[39:51] Christ was about in the bridge
[39:55] we know that the bridge opens up
[39:59] as the revelation of Christ
[40:02] to the Overcomers of the origin churches
[40:08] they overcame Lord this year
[40:11] which was Lord this year is Babylon
[40:15] Babylon amen religious confusion
[40:19] are you together with me now amen so now
[40:23] would you have to call them
[40:29] with those who withstood the whales of
[40:33] the enemies
[40:35] now listen here
[40:38] was overcome by the wires
[40:41] [Music]
[40:47] is counting craftiness
[40:50] [Music]
[40:52] when the serpent first Eve
[40:56] in the garden he used wires
[41:05] which Moses called subatility
[41:10] amen Amina now the serpent was more
[41:14] subtle everybody
[41:19] you know he was rude
[41:23] to mean that he was life
[41:28] but then Eve said
[41:32] the serpent beguiled me into um
[41:38] amen Amina so the devil uses the same
[41:41] method says
[41:43] in the Harvest
[41:45] as he did in the seeding in the Genesis
[41:50] you see we are now in the Harvest time
[41:55] but Genesis was the city
[42:00] amen and we see that in Genesis
[42:04] the enemy used while
[42:09] he used craftiness
[42:12] the Bible says he was rude
[42:17] he was
[42:41] [Music]
[42:52] so your mind should be corrupted from
[42:56] the Simplicity that is in Christ amen
[43:19] foreign
[43:20] [Music]
[43:35] are you together with me what is it so
[43:37] it involved a female Spirit In The
[43:41] Genesis
[43:43] and I want to tell you that even in the
[43:46] Harvest
[43:48] the same two Spirits operates
[43:51] it is still this happened
[43:54] amen amen and also a female spirit
[44:00] that was in the sitting and it has to be
[44:05] in the Harvest Church
[44:09] when you saw corn you Repcon
[44:13] [Music]
[44:15] meaning that the wives of the enemy have
[44:19] never taken
[44:21] so I want to introduce you to the age of
[44:25] Lord this year
[44:27] because the age of Lord this year is the
[44:30] last Church
[44:32] [Music]
[44:34] and I mean so it's the edge of the
[44:37] Harvest as I've always said
[44:41] so all the good on the back
[44:44] comes to the Harvest during this age
[44:48] amen and you know that in the city
[44:55] and there was also details
[44:58] I know this comes up into the Harvest
[45:01] here
[45:03] so that the which can be taken to the
[45:05] guns
[45:08] gather together for burning
[45:12] amen so Lord this year is predominantly
[45:17] overwhelmed by a female spirit
[45:22] this is the woman's world
[45:26] as we wind up with the time
[45:30] everybody believes this is a woman's
[45:33] world
[45:35] [Music]
[45:44] [Music]
[45:57] as president of the United States
[46:04] are you together with it what is it so
[46:07] in the salutation
[46:11] God is addressing himself to the Church
[46:14] of Lord this year
[46:17] to a female
[46:20] dominated
[46:22] [Music]
[46:23] that's in Revelation chapter 3 verse
[46:28] he says and unto the angel of the Church
[46:32] of the Lord
[46:37] whatever
[46:41] [Music]
[46:52] [Music]
[47:00] you understand language
[47:03] not enter the church in Lord this is
[47:07] but the Church of the Lord this year
[47:11] now in the end times
[47:18] and this church here is not under the
[47:22] country of Christ
[47:26] they just have the convention
[47:29] of some kind
[47:31] and now there is decide to say now we
[47:35] can legalize the homosexual marriages
[47:43] it's the people the people put out
[47:47] crying
[47:48] it's a church of the Lord this year
[47:52] amen so in dealing with this age
[47:56] we are dealing with the power of the
[47:58] female
[48:00] amen my sisters I'm not talking about
[48:04] you
[48:06] who has got the Holy Ghost
[48:08] amen because you don't fit in the
[48:11] picture
[48:13] of the woman Indian time
[48:16] you are Justified
[48:18] you are Sanctified you are filled with
[48:22] the Holy Ghost and your life for bless
[48:25] the instructions of the world
[48:27] so I'm not talking about the sisters
[48:31] I'm talking about the woman
[48:34] but not the sister a sister mother she's
[48:38] female
[48:39] she's completely under different domain
[48:43] I'm talking about women I'm talking
[48:47] about the spirit of a woman
[48:49] a spirit of a woman who does not care
[48:53] how she appears
[48:55] amen one of these days it's going to be
[48:59] a fashion
[49:00] for them to walk out of the house
[49:02] decades
[49:04] if there was no law against indecence
[49:08] saying that you have a day
[49:11] foreign
[49:44] because you must know why
[49:49] that's the problem of the law
[49:53] when the law comes to promote
[49:57] you turn you tell everybody you don't
[49:59] open this room
[50:01] you try everything possible to happen
[50:06] and I'm telling you this you can go and
[50:10] practice
[50:11] just tell a child or anybody but never
[50:16] look under this mattress
[50:19] and then you make your dream I mean your
[50:23] your your bed in a certain way
[50:26] when you come back you will find out
[50:29] that that bed has been tampered
[50:36] it's just projected
[50:39] without the Lord there was nothing
[50:42] when you tell the person don't do this
[50:46] he will do it to see what you are going
[50:49] to do this is the nature of a man so he
[50:53] says
[50:57] I'm a human that's yeah
[51:13] and she was shopping
[51:15] how many years ago are those yeah
[51:24] if there is no law
[51:26] they will come first
[51:31] how many of you ever heard of the
[51:33] hippies
[51:36] hippies
[51:38] there was a time
[51:41] in our our second year
[51:45] I don't know I think sister Beatrice was
[51:47] not very curious those years
[52:03] you know a hip is a person
[52:07] who is just there to do wrong yeah
[52:12] they started and it flourished in the
[52:15] universities
[52:17] they would just go somewhere in a public
[52:20] place
[52:24] and then they run around the city
[52:30] this is the age that we are living
[52:34] so the woman
[52:37] this age reflects
[52:43] is not Sarah my wife
[52:47] she has Faithfully lived the life of the
[52:50] 50 gospel
[52:54] so this Lord this is
[52:57] not speak about a woman like her
[53:01] no you don't speak about a woman like
[53:04] you that comes to a message
[53:13] amen amen that advocated for the rights
[53:17] of the people
[53:18] and this gave this city
[53:22] and another definition
[53:24] other than being a female dominated City
[53:40] [Music]
[54:03] [Music]
[54:28] because his life foreign
[54:48] [Music]
[55:52] and so those men took Jesus
[56:03] are you together with me I went from the
[56:06] land of Israel
[56:08] praise God everybody
[56:11] amen amen so they completely took him
[56:14] out
[56:18] like when Jesus came out of the grace
[56:21] the Jews totally rejected
[56:24] and he went out among the Gentiles
[56:28] that's why you have the gospel today
[56:31] [Music]
[56:33] so now that's prophecy might believe the
[56:37] life
[56:39] might be the voice of the Prophet
[56:43] that says the Lord
[56:46] unto us the sun is born
[56:49] like I said
[56:53] we've go to the church the church Begins
[56:59] the Holy Spirit comes down
[57:02] Hallelujah and now as we have the uh
[57:08] Church beginning languages
[57:10] the church was supposed to move
[57:14] all the way back to the coming of Christ
[57:18] second coming of Christ
[57:22] the lord
[57:25] wanted to tell the story

[1:09:36] place
[1:09:38] and the second was human rights

[1:11:19] I know that you cannot have a speaker
[1:11:23] that's a man named and you have a deputy
[1:11:27] speaker is
[1:11:29] it has to be either the speaker is a man
[1:11:34] and then the deputy must be a woman
[1:11:37] because if the top is
[1:11:41] then the deputy should I mean he is a
[1:11:44] woman should be a man
[1:11:46] and it's the same in the church
[1:11:49] you know you need to have a spiritual
[1:11:53] and look at things by the spirit
[1:11:56] amen in all these churches
[1:12:03] the woman is The Interpreter
[1:12:13] we we just look at things
[1:12:18] and we don't bring them back into
[1:12:21] preface
[1:12:23] amen amen but then Isaiah says in
[1:12:28] chapter 3
[1:12:29] verse 12. and for many people
[1:12:34] children are there oppressors
[1:12:37] and the women rule over there
[1:12:43] you see when we say children
[1:12:47] we are talking in our spiritually here
[1:12:51] no visas
[1:12:56] men who have not dug deep into the world
[1:13:03] you know the oppressors of the people
[1:13:08] you see in scripture
[1:13:10] age is not chronological
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:46] that's the age
[1:13:53] I want to hear a very good amen
[1:13:57] is it all
[1:13:58] which has grown on the fertile ground
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:05] which has life amen
[1:14:08] praise the Lord you see we need to look
[1:14:11] at these things spiritually
[1:14:13] they do things which have nothing to do
[1:14:17] with the Bible every time
[1:14:19] amen where the Bible says that you lay
[1:14:22] hands on the the sick and they recover
[1:14:25] Bible
[1:14:36] they put their hearts in the pockets
[1:14:40] and tell people we are going to pray
[1:14:43] that you may possess money in your
[1:14:46] pocket
[1:14:48] children oppress the people
[1:14:52] and the other day in Kenya Kenya this
[1:14:56] man here was holding his foreign
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:42] [Music]
[1:15:44] and women
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:45] foreign
[1:17:00] [Music]
[1:17:07] foreign when she prays for them for
[1:17:10] healing
[1:17:11] will they not get healed
[1:17:14] they will get their healing
[1:17:19] is a very simple answer
[1:17:28] if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you
[1:17:31] are not a Believer you cannot take it
[1:17:34] because you are blessing yourself in
[1:17:37] Lord this year
[1:17:40] where they put out the answers of the
[1:17:42] world
[1:17:45] answers to everything
[1:17:49] are you together
[1:17:51] so the question was
[1:17:53] is answered
[1:17:58] was first formed then is
[1:18:04] what does that mean when Eve came
[1:18:07] foreign
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:53] are you together with me
[1:18:55] listen now Adam was not deceased but the
[1:19:01] woman being deceased
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:05] so now when Ephesians
[1:19:09] teach us about marriage
[1:19:12] at the end of it
[1:19:16] from verse
[1:19:31] and you love your wife
[1:19:36] and I see whether you love them
[1:19:44] I'm not seeing those who are changing
[1:19:47] places amen I mean you see
[1:19:51] men love your words
[1:19:54] this means they were far away from Eve
[1:20:00] I need to give the serpent to the
[1:20:02] opportunity
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:52] [Music]
[1:20:59] are you together with me that's why the
[1:21:02] Bible says
[1:21:04] let your women keep silence
[1:21:09] is not permitted that to them to speak
[1:21:11] but they are commanded to be and
[1:21:14] obedient
[1:21:15] as also says
[1:21:18] and the Bible says if they don't
[1:21:22] understand anything
[1:21:30] [Applause]
[1:21:33] who want to be pastors
[1:21:36] your first church is your wife if you
[1:21:42] cannot be able to teach your wife
[1:21:45] the work of Christ you have no business
[1:22:08] it has to be the husband
[1:22:10] then the wife
[1:22:17] praise the Lord this is a very
[1:22:20] interesting thing
[1:22:22] that let them keep silence in the church
[1:22:26] but they are commanded to be under
[1:22:30] obedience
[1:22:32] about what they say as also says the law
[1:22:38] Grace and the law it is
[1:22:43] to this best thing on the happening in
[1:22:46] the garden
[1:22:49] and the chronological order of creation
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:55] what is that position in the church
[1:22:59] there are many things that she can do
[1:23:02] but I will not take that subject to do
[1:23:05] today
[1:23:06] but she can be a political activist
[1:23:11] if she was out there in the world
[1:23:17] she can even be a prophetess like
[1:23:20] Deborah is
[1:23:29] foreign
[1:24:02] and some of them say a pastor or
[1:24:06] something
[1:24:07] but that contradicts the world
[1:24:11] cannot say they should not preach
[1:24:15] to the Corinthians
[1:24:17] and then it goes to the Romans
[1:24:20] and he says I've sent freebie to Quarry
[1:24:23] that conventional
[1:24:30] just look at what the scripture says
[1:24:34] Paul introduces himself differently
[1:24:39] he never first verse
[1:24:44] he never called himself a servant of the
[1:24:47] church
[1:24:51] a man who wonders the gospel mustard
[1:24:56] is not a servant of the church
[1:24:59] he's a servant of Jesus Christ
[1:25:04] that's the difference now Paul knew what
[1:25:07] he was saying he says
[1:25:14] she's coming to visit in that area
[1:25:18] she's a very commendable woman
[1:25:22] [Music]
[1:25:24] because she is the servant of the church
[1:25:33] I would become a servant of the church
[1:25:41] how to become a servant of the church
[1:25:43] today
[1:25:47] when he was sending them out
[1:25:50] he was sending men
[1:25:53] not because he didn't have women
[1:25:56] but he understood the order of the world
[1:26:00] the women were there some people say you
[1:26:04] know Jesus
[1:26:06] situations
[1:26:08] and therefore
[1:26:10] he did not have women there
[1:26:15] amen amen
[1:26:18] oh praise the Lord hear those women
[1:26:23] [Music]
[1:26:29] but he never said to them but they
[1:26:33] ministered to his Jesus
[1:26:37] the servant of the church
[1:26:39] look at how the church
[1:26:43] behind that is
[1:26:54] foreign
[1:27:05] it never meant a preacher
[1:27:07] in Romans chapter 1 for the servant of
[1:27:11] Jesus Christ
[1:27:13] amen Amina when you go to Galatians I
[1:27:17] mean First Corinthians it says
[1:27:21] of Jesus Christ
[1:27:24] when you go to First Corinthians chapter
[1:27:27] I mean second Corinthians chapter one
[1:27:30] verses
[1:27:32] of Jesus Christ
[1:27:35] when you go to Galatians chapter one he
[1:27:40] says
[1:27:45] by Jesus Christ
[1:27:48] amen amen you go to Ephesians
[1:27:53] of Jesus Christ
[1:27:55] he knew how to use his words
[1:27:59] so Romans 16 1.
[1:28:03] is not a preacher feedback
[1:28:13] is not a preacher amen
[1:28:15] foreign
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:40] [Music]

[1:30:11] there
[1:30:12] you'll find about 40 women
[1:30:16] and 15 minutes
[1:30:25] it is most worthy of note that the very
[1:30:29] names attire means dominating female
[1:30:36] [Music]

[1:36:58] after that another messenger had to come
[1:37:04] yeah and now they would say
[1:37:07] unto the angels of the church
[1:37:15] now Stephen here is coming here at the
[1:37:20] end of the church
[1:37:22] he gets a message which is the Lord has

[2:08:33] as they could have been around
[2:08:36] amen Amina enlightened because they were
[2:08:41] in cubanda sometimes by doctrines
