is very beautiful singing Praise the name of you feel like you don't want to stop but we still live in time may be I've just been at Baba F you know the arranged the programs for the different denominations of Faith through the whole being the last day of the year so different Faith have been there so then our time was there to be from 300 p.m. up to 3:30 that's where I have been and then I didn't know what to talk about but now when I reached there the Mind came to me about Genesis 8 verse 22 where the Bible says that seasons and times time time winter summer night and day will not cease so I talked about it is God that gives us the time praise the name of our who created it when you read in Genesis 1 verse 14 he says he has put the lives in the Heavens to give us times years month and everything that's now the life here live on earth like when you look at how they talk about a year a year is when the sun has fully rotated I mean the Earth has fully rated around the sun and the day this the Earth rotates in one place and as it keeps on turning then the hours keep on changing when it is when it is on this other side and the Sun is this way then it is dark this side this side is light then it turns like now in Australia Australia they in a new day already in a new year in America is still night so you how the Lord has made it but yet these things are just temporary things praise the name but we have the true son the son of God God praise the name of our Lord and when the Son of God shines there is no Darkness praise the name of the Lord in Revelations 21 and 22 there will be no sun like this one but it will be the lamp of God will be the light of and then it will be eternity there will be no night there so then I was challenging the people as we have got this light the natural light we have the True Light which we also need to get into and that one puts us into eternity praise the name of as we thank God for the new year we need Christ to be in Us Praise the name of our Lord so now I have your testimony our sister da is very grateful for brother o and sister MAA for giving her this radio and she wants us to dedicate it you know I was almost hesitant of bringing it here I said maybe I will pray it from away but you see as small as it may be it signifies something very important praise the name of our Lord and so she requests us to pray for them to pray for the radi and also to pray for our brother and S there is a brother I know of he wanted to buy a camera video camera and even still photo and then he moved around to borrow money and some people were could not even lend him money and others were saying if I'm going to give you the money you'll become my worker and then another said have you have1 million and now you want me to give you 3 million and he brought he got the million and put it before him have you this kind of money so he told me told him no you be patient God will open so he got his friends who are doing that kind of video coverage and so on and then he was able to get little money and then he start paying half half and then they gave him the camera on credit now he got that camera and then he brought it to his pastor and said pastor I want you to dedicate this camer and the pastor was humble enough got camera brought it before the church and said you're seeing this camera it's for brother so and so said he wants to dedicate it that from it may come other things so they dedicated the C they pray for that camera and if you looked at that camera and the things that came from that camera it is so strange from that camera he got a car from that camera he got land from that camera he built a house from that camera he got a job so small but because it was blessed of the Lord many things came from praise the name of the Lord let us dedicate this radio in the hands of the Lord father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for this radio Lord that has been given by the family of our brother and our sister to our sister da dedicate it into your hands Lord and Lord we know how sister da loves you so much we pray father you may watch over this father and help her to use it for the glory of your holy name as be using it for listening to the messages of the hour the church programs we pray that father from it Lord Jesus Christ you may make yourself known in such a special we also Grant all her heart desires even bless our brother and of given it to her and we pray you may help us father to be concerned about one another be able to support and stand with one another love we thank you in the name of the Lord Jesus amen am God bless you so much so I would request we turn on our feet sorry taken we thought that would start by I would start preaching by 4 but it's already 420 something but I pray you'll bear with us and then we take at least maybe 1 hour also let us go to the book of First Corinthians chapter 6 from verse 15 to verse 20 before we read let us pray father we thank you for this afternoon the grace you've given us to come back here Lord that father we can Worship You Lord and thank you for the things that you have done in our lives we pray again you may speak to us Lord may direct us Lord and manifest yourself to us we love you Lord and we thank you ified and glorified in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen so First Corinthians 6 from verse 15 up to verse 20 know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of unh harot God forbid what know ye not that he which is joined to a hot is one body for the two says he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit free fornication every sin that a man does is without the body but that commits fornication sins against his body what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are godes may God blessing of his word may be seated so I want to speak about rededication praise the name of our Lord you know when you read in the scriptures you find actually like in the Book of Judges the Bible says when you know when God didn't have a judge there then the people were Fallen but then when God would bring the judge then the people would be brought back in the hands of God and the Victory of the people lasted as long as the judge was there when the judge was not there the people went back to the things which are not right and now we see that we are living in a time that even we've had also the seven Church ages you know as the Gentile church and each Church age God has has been sending a messenger praise the name of our Lord and then you see that when God had finished sending a messenger then after some time when the messenger has gone then the people who believed then the others who come in denominate and then the cycle continued on but now we are living at the end time where the Revival that God sent by the prophet can never be denominated praise the name of our Lord so then because this is the word in its fullness and then you see also let us read in this message the spoken word is the Original Seed he says but in every generation every Revival bring forth some prophet of God a prophet is a preacher true preacher on the word that stays with the word and they bring forth a Revival that gathers that elect out of that generation then in paragraph 104 he says each generation has its Revival God raises up a man sets him with his word and starts him out for the message of that age and as soon as that man is taken off the scene somebody else catches it and hybrids it praise the name of our Lord and now we see even what's happening in our time that if we are not careful you find yourself with a message that has been hybridized you know the me the true message some people would get it and then they mix it with their ideas and then maybe some people because they are having a different background maybe he was a Baptist he wants to mix the Baptist understanding in and bring it in the message or maybe he was a Catholic get the Catholic understanding and bring it into the message or he was a Pentecostal still as the p h and wants to bring it in the message kind of like making it a hybd not something that is pure so we see that this Spirit still exist but the true bride of Christ will overcome all these Spirits praise the name of Lord the true bride of Christ will overcome all this deception and now we know that we are living in a time where the challenge is great praise the name of our Lord and that's why we need to rededicate our lives you know you rededicate it praise the name of our Lord and you know like Paul say I'm crucified so Christ has to be risen in our lives I Die daily so if I die daily then I can only become alive in Christ and that should always be our desire a rededication if yesterday didn't do something right if yesterday didn't do something well Lord help me today to do better than I did yesterday what are you doing you are rededicating Yourself Praise the name of our Lord you're saying Lord help me in this kind of situation and that should be a Christian Burden Burden in your heart that you know you seek the Lord and say Lord I want to please you Lord I Want To Know Your will for my life Lord I want to find out what you want me to do that should be always a burden in our hearts you know every time that you leave every day that you raise up in the morning you are saying Lord come to my rescue Lord come and help me in this kind of Lord come and help me this kind of weakness read dedication of Our Lives praise the name of our Lord now in the message it's the seven Church age book page 113 he says no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually health and Alive than his knowledge of and adance to the pure word of God God as seen by multitudes of examples in the Old Testament I just love that he says there is no True Believer is stronger spiritually healthy alive more than his knowledge and obedience to the word of God so now if you have got the knowledge of the word of God then you need to be obedient to that word of God that's how you overcome Spirits that's how you overcome habits praise the name of our Lord you know you hear the word of God and the word of God brings to your knowledge that this thing is wrong so now when you get to know that it is wrong you start hating the wrong thing I don't want to do that kind of praise the name of the Lord like I this thing just keeps on coming to my mind because it is the basic thing we can our like if you hate somebody and then you hear the Bible says you should not hate anyone say ah it is easier to hate than to love because it's a nature to hate now you know you hear that is bad say Lord help me so then your enemy comes he really hates you but the Bible says you shouldn't hate him you shouldn't hate him you shouldn't think wrong against now initially you may not love them but now there's a conviction in your heart that I should not hate them so now when you see them coming sometimes you feel I don't want to meet him so the first time you may Dodge you pass this way you give them their peace then you say but they say I should love my en and then God brings you back into the same test and this time either he will get you in a bank maybe you are the one ahead he has lined up a little bit behind you you come and then your eyes meet what are you going to do okay you may not say much I'm not comfortable with that how are you how are you and then you feel B so it keeps on breaking and then you find that that terrible heart you had about that person it vanishes away the more you continue dedicating yourself to God it goes away praise the name of our Lord you are able to overcome that situation so now you know the word of God you need to oby the word of God and that's where our strength is praise the name of our Lord we grow praise the name of our Lord like if a child is starting to to walk they walk by stumbling and they not certain but it doesn't matter how many times they they will still endeav to walk because it is in nature and so even the word of God is a seat so we just allow it right inside of us and then it will bring a transformation in our Liv just obey it just allow it take over in other words you are dedicating yourself you are surrendering yourself the Bible has told us here in First Corinthians chapter 6 that we are with a price verse therefore glorify God in your body in your spirit which are godes praise the name of our Lord you just allow him take over your life you allowed the Holy Spirit to do what he wants to do now in the book of Exodus chter 25 praise the name of our Lord Exodus 25 and then verse verse 8 the scripture says and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them so now God told Moses that I want to dwell in their midst so then God tells Moses make me a sanctuary and then he told the children of Israel to contribute the materials for the s and then he gave the pattern to Moses and then Moses saw the pattern and then when Moses you know and even God sent the people are going to build the sanctu he gave them the spirit of understanding and then the people contributed the materials and then Moses was under instruction that he should do everything according to the pattern that he saw and now the Bible says Moses did everything according to the pattern which God has shown him in Exodus 4 Exodus chapter 40 and then verse 31 and Moses and Aaron his and his sons wash their hands and their feet there at exod 4 ver 31 and when they went into the tent of the congregation and when they came near unto the altar they wased as the Lord commanded Moses and heared up the round about the Tabernacle and the Altar and set up the hanging of the Court gate so so Moses finished the work praise the name of the Lord so Moses finished the work the work that he was instructed to do he did everything according to the Commandment of God and that should also be the same thing with us to do everything according to the Commandment of God what the commanded us to do we also should seek to do the same thing so now when Moses had put everything in its position the Bible says then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of congregation because the cloud AB there on and the glory of the Lord fill the Tabernacle praise the name of the Lord the glory of God came down he was satisfied with the work that was done praise the name of our Lord and that should be also our lives himself comes down and settles in us he is satisfied with our life he is satisfied to come and dwell in our hearts he is satisfied to say that now you are my Tabernacle I will walk in you I will dwell in you praise the name of the Lord that should be the same thing and then you see that when we follow the instructions of God the Lord will humble himself and come down that's what happened in the Days of Elijah you know Elijah when he got the instruction of God go and gather all the children of Israel let them come to mount C so elah told Ahab bring the 450 prophets of bir bring all of them and then he told them we need now to have a showdown who is God if B be God worship but if the Lord God be godship him and then he says let us get two bulls and he told them you get the bull yourself pick what you want you are very many start calling on to come and bring fire on the Altar and then these people here praise the name of they started jumping on the altar oh we see of now bariers they called B from morning up to evening and the bar was not there and was saying maybe he has going to hunt maybe sleeping oh shout louder they started cutting now our God is not like that that you punish your your PR you know this sin which have committed need SE be shed his blood praise the name of the Lord why did Jesus shed his blood and then you hear somebody saying going in they call it dry fast and is it how many days and this person starts feeling hungry but he says no I should not break the F the Bible says when the fasting ended he was hungry so the moment hunger comes the first is over but somebody says I said I said this number of days number ofs now your mind is going to go to food and not God praise the name of you know Peter was praying and fasting and he felt hungry and when he felt hungry Heaven came down Jesus was fasting for 40 days and the Bible says when he had finished fasting he became hungry so when you become hungry and you are fasting no that's the end of the F but somebody say no it is this this no it's not like that and then the Bible says that these people pray with vain repetition and then Jesus says you think by much speaking God will hear you repeating repeating and some would want to go to market places and in corners of streets you know like you go you got Main Street and Main Street and nisam Road in the corner there he want everybody to know oh come and I pray for you come what come I do the was leaving Fellowship in I think two weeks ago and then we had stopped at the traffic light around Road I say woman come she was holding a Bible and then she comes I was wondering what is she up to praise the Lord give me some Christmas is it you to ask me to feel to give you no that's not right they doing things in v and then you're using the Bible to no praise the name of our Lord but you see there is a lot of B worship too much B worship but now you look at Elijah the Bible says when the time of the evening oblation came he was referring the scripture he knew the time where the sacrifice has to be made and then he started repairing the altar of using the 12 Stones of represent the children of Israel and then he laid every stone according to the word of God and then he cut the animal and then he put it on the on the Altar and then he told them pour water several times until when they pour the water over and then he he rose up and said Lord I have done everything sing according to your word praise the name of our Lord and I've done it according to your word I'm not doing it according to my understanding but I'm following your word and then the scripture says and then fire came from heaven and then burn the sacrif the same thing like now when Moses was dedicated was having that Tabernacle finished the same thing when Solomon was dedicating the temple everything was put in place the Bible says the glory of God came down and the ministers could not Minister because of the glory of God that filled the temple and that should be also the same thing with us when we have done everything according to the command of God come and take over all my life you rededicate yourself you surrender yourself Lord Here I Am Lord I am nothing but I want you to fill my heart I want you to fill my life I want you to take over my life to direct me to use me that's the same thing he is the same God on the day of Pentecost they had also done everything according to the Commandment of God and then the Bible says the Holy Ghost came down from heaven Like A Mighty Wind and fill the house where they were and then CL tanks appeared on them and then it settled in them and then their ts were quickened and then they started speaking with and the Holy Ghost filled every one of God recognizes when we obey his word and that should be our desire if this is what the Lord wants you to do be obedient to that praise the name of our Lord in other words you are becoming a building because it is the word that builds us and when we are obeying the word we are becoming the temple you are making the place ready you preparing yourself the holy spirit will surely come into that place praise the name of our Lord the Holy Ghost will not t because he's looking for people to F he wants us to be his Dwelling Place praise the name of our Lord this year has been maybe we have done a lot of mistakes or we have failed in many things but then we said Lord like Samson once more Lord praise the name of the Lord and as long as you are still alive there is still opportunity for you to be filled with God himself there still opportunity for you to overcome all your weaknesses there still opportunity for you to do the will of God in your life and that should be our Zeal our desire Lord not my own but let your will be done in my life praise the name of our Lord we should honestly desire seek the Lord rededicate ourselves to him praise the name of the Lord and to rededicate yourself is to be available to God lord use me the way it's pleasing you you are obeying the word of God you know you are being obedient to the word and the Holy Spirit doesn't have difficulty to direct you praise the name of the Lord the Holy Ghost finds it easy you have not grieved the Holy Spirit you g the Holy Spirit by not being obedient to the word of God praise the name of the Lord but you are obeying the word the scripture says giving ourselves to the word of God and to prayer praise the name of our Lord when you don't pray you are quenching the spirit when you don't obey the word of God read the word of God Obe the word of God you are grieving the spirit so you should not grieve the spirit and you should not quench the spirit you know you need to have that Zeal in your life Let It Be continuous be something a one off but you know it is a life that you live a continuous dedication praise the name of the Lord in the message how can I overcome the prophet says and I want to take my subject this morning of the how can I overcome now I chose this because that I think that it is a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die we've got to keep in Revival constantly revive every day said he had to Die daily that Christ could live and we should never let that Revival die within us praise the name of our Lord we should live under that Spirit of Revival Revival praise the name of Lord keep that Spirit flowing keep that river flowing praise the name of the Lord let it be continuous in you praise the name of the Lord you know like the Bible says how we sing Jesus is the River of Life let us go to John chapter 7 praise the name of the Lord John 7 and then verse 37 he says in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Praise the name of the Lord says if any man thirst let him come and drink praise the name of the Lord so in other words Jesus is that great Fountain and this Fountain it is a continuous flow praise the name of the Lord It's not a temporary work but it is a continuous flow and you also need to strike in that continuous way praise the name of our Lord like when you want to dig a well you don't dig a well when it is raining because you may reach false Waters when it is dry even becomes dry that's not our Lord Jesus Christ but when you want to have a constant flow you dig when it is so dry and then you reach the real constant flow down it may be deep but worth it praise the name of our Lord you know it will never dry it's a continuous flow that's our Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord it shouldn't be something temporary shouldn't be something for only Sunday something for only the end of the year the name of our Lord like this night and somebody is going to be desperate praying for this and this and this and then after that you put it back it shouldn't be like that it should be a continuous FL a constant flow continuous Revival the Lord Reviving your heart praise the name of the Lord we should be in that kind of continuity he says he that believeth you know it is something that is continuous not he that believed or who will believe but he that believeth in other words you are continuously drinking you are continuously partaking and as you keep on drinking it keeps on refreshing you keeps on changing keeps on transforming you and bringing you into the image of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's why the Lord was telling the woman at the world that this water that I give it Springs up into everlasting life praise the name of our Lord and now when you drink of that water you also become aware why because you are connected there is a flow that is continuous and as it flows in you you also start bubbling out flowing out different streams coming out of you the stream of love comes out of you the stream of Joy comes out of you the stream of Peace comes out of you the stream of longsuffering comes out of you the stream of faith comes out of you the stream of patience comes out of you the of weakness comes out of you the stream of goodness comes out of you now if these streams are flowing out of you so they will come and wash any bitterness along the way the stream of Love is Flowing then it will wash away the hatred if the stream of joy is flowing it will

from the Lord it keeps on flowing a continuous flow praise the name of our Lord and that's what we need to desire in our Liv Let Me Be Connected praise the name of our Lord fully connected to him now in the message why Christ speak he says one thing that the Tabernacle needs up here at our church is a rededication and a refilling of the Holy Ghost right everyone to get down to the Altar and pray until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost the whole church be filled with the power of God that's what we need not only the Tabernacle there but the body of Christ Universal it needs a refilling David said one day restore unto me the joy of my Sal now he had not lost his salvation but the joy of it and when it comes to a place that I cannot enjoy my religion I cannot enjoy my salvation there is something wrong somewhere because it is joy unspeakable and full of Glory one of them said test and see the Lord is good it tastes like Honey in the Rock oh I'm so glad that I have tested that the Lord is good and I love honey but I never tested any like that that's the best that I know praise the name of our Lord he said we need a refilling if you have been filled with the Holy Ghost tell God I need to be filled SE the Lord I need to be filled if you have never been filled you need also to call upon the name of the Lord come and fill your heart with this spirit with his power to transform you to become a new creation praise the name of our Lord Christ so he says we need that dedication Ying God himself to come down in our lives it's no longer I that lives but it is God that lives in a rededication you hear the word of God you're obedient to the word of God and then you are prayerful you are seeking the face of God and saying Lord here I am guide me direct me praise the name of our Lord and the more you yield to God the more he uses you for his kingdom praise the name of our Lord he uses you even to help others to pray for others support others to encourage others he comes down and uses you because you have rededicated yourself praise the name of our Lord and that's that we need to be that when somebody comes and talks to you they find peace when they are talking to they find Comfort when they are talking to like when David would start struming his instrument then the demons which are troubling Soul should even you also at your place of work when they are traveled and then they come to you they find a presence that is so sweet until they don't want please pray for me there is this problem at home there is this at home because they seeing the life is differ praise the name of our Lord so your your fountains are flowing they are blessing others others find joy to be in your company you know they just want to be around you why there is a presence of God praise the name of our Lord you created an environment of a spiritual being until people just want to be in your presence praise the name of our Lord like when Peter were walking on the streets and the Bible says there are shadows were healing the people that was a presence that was an overflow a flowing fountain they took the hand from body and they were healing people it's the same God even here and that should be the same with us praise the name of our Lord until you can lay your hand on a person and pray for them even at place of work or at school or at home and then the Lord hears your prayer praise the name of our Lord we need to rededicate our that these things become a reality praise the name of some people are disturbed by demons you know it's not difficult for you to chase them away and you'll see the light and then you'll run away praise the name of our Lord you know we need to have that kind of life where the presence of God is real in our lives the life that we live the fruit that we bear and even the demonstration of the Holy The Works that I do shall you do also praise the name of our Lord God is the same he's the same God and he should Believe in Us demonstrating his presence in our lives with the more you yield yourself to is the more your fountains is the more your well Keeps On Blessing others praise the name of our Lord now let us go to the message brother we go to Psalms chapter 1 praise the name of our Lord Psalms chapter 1 and then verse two start from verse one blessed is the man that walks not in the C of the ungodly nor that stands in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night praise the name of our Lord so he says but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and He meditates upon it day and night then the Bible says shall be like a river planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Le also shall not wither and whatsoever he does he shall prosper and then brother Bram says rivers of water see same water but there is an outlet that comes this way this way and this way depends on what Outlet it's the same spirit so the fountain is here but there's an outlet of love and then of Peace Jo of patience of goodness keeps on flowing from that Fountain same water this one FL does this same water does this same water you know bearing the fruit of the spirit same water demonstrating the power of God bringing healing bringing Deliverance praise the name of our Lord and bringing the gifts of the Spirit water praise the name of the Lord It's just coming from the same Fountain but the manifestations keep on varing different Ministries different gifts different administrations praise the name of our Lord same Fountain when we rededicate ourselves praise the name of our Lord and then you will see that we Shall Have No Lack of anything but everybody has been able to find their position positionally placed praise the name of our Lord now in the message the unfailing realities of the Living God he says God can only use what you give him now there is a lot of you will say I'll give him 15 minutes on Sunday morning if you preach any longer than that I'll just get up and go home where you got 15 minutes on Sunday morning that's what you give to God it depends but we need to give him our all then he says what can you give God will receive what ever you'll give but God wants all of you he wants every bit of you he wants all he wants everything you are he wants your life he wants your testimony he wants every minute you live he wants you to live right act right talk right do right he wants everything perfectly surrender to him that he can lead you and guide you and put you into places where

all that I am I am not my own but I Surrender myself to you praise the name of the Lord let us go to Colossians 3 as I try to finish colians 3 verse one verse one says if you be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on the things above not on the things on the Earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory praise the name of the Lord set your affection on the things above the desires on the invisible things the things of God to manifest the life of God in us praise the name of our Lord and we should not look at the things on earth all your mind all your attention everything but about the things above praise the name of God how much Investments have you made up there praise the name of the Lord how much have you put up there like that song that says there are men trying to do a lot of investment here on Earth

Creator [Music] myor and all [Music] good amen praise the name of the Lord so come the time of the Lord supper in the [Music] denominations they even take in the morning but the Lord is supper so we also try to observe that the time should be similar the time of the supper praise the name of the Lord and you know when the supper time has come like you can see mostly in schools they start around this [Music] time it is always in the evening praise the name of our Lord that's why we try to observe it at the time when it is relevant praise the name of the Lord and we know that the Lord is supper was the time of the Passover and you see in the book of Exodus chapter 12 they also observed it in the evening and then our Lord Jesus Christ comes when we go to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and then we read in verse 23 [Music] for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betro took [Music] bread and when had given thanks he broke it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of [Music] me so now the bread is unle bread nothing is put inside it other than mixing it with water no oil is put no salt is put no nothing is put unle bread and said this is my body which represents the word and then in verse 25 after the same manner also he took the cup when he had Saed saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of [Music] me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord is death till he come whereever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord andw worthily shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him that eat of the bread and drink of the [Music] cup so we know our lives and when we come before the Lord we always need to be sincere and you know you examine yourself you find you are not worthy then you cry to the Lord to help you to make you worthy nobody can make you worth the Lord himself that's why we have the blood of Jesus Christ that makes us worthy by your faith in the word makes you worthy and then you see that this this cup and then the bread he says if you don't partake of them then you are not part of me so it is necessary that you partake of it and as we said we want to be doing it every month praise the name of our Lord so let us pray as we are going to start partaking of it also keep yourself in prayer father in the name of
