[39:36] Spirit welcoming the word of
[39:39] God already have sung the
[39:41] song it had a very powerful
[39:44] message about the
[39:46] revelation of the hour that we are
[39:48] living in because the revelation of the
[39:51] hour that we are living in is the one
[39:54] which brings the power of transformation
[39:57] to change our lives that we can be
[40:00] different from the people of the world

[41:45] 17 always is a blessing to come
[41:49] home blessed me of the
[41:52] Lord John 1
[42:00] we want to look at verse
[42:03] six I have manifested thy name and the
[42:06] men which thou has given me out of the
[42:09] world they are were and they are given
[42:13] them me they have kept
[42:24] word so I want to talk about the
[42:30] word bless
[42:33] word you may be SE so I want to welcome
[42:36] you I know yesterday we
[42:39] tired because of the
[42:41] function but the prophet said in the
[42:43] message tusting for
[42:46] life if you are a Christian you long to
[42:49] go where other Christians
[42:51] are and fellowship with other
[42:55] Christians so you cannot stay away from
[42:58] church and live the same life so just
[43:02] coming to church it changed your life
[43:05] because we among the people who are
[43:09] prated who has the hand of the Lord who
[43:12] knows the will of God so that's why I
[43:14] want to thank you for putting the
[43:17] sacrifice this
[43:18] morning to be in the house of the Lord
[43:21] so the prophet
[43:23] says the prophet says
[43:30] you stay right on the
[43:32] word the word is life every time you
[43:36] receive the
[43:37] word you receive
[43:39] life stay with the word stay right with
[43:42] the
[43:43] word that word is life every time you
[43:47] receive the word you receive
[43:50] life take it in your
[43:52] heart not only receiving it
[43:57] take it in your
[43:59] heart and when you take it in your
[44:01] heart believe it as you your own
[44:08] possession so the word must become part
[44:10] of
[44:11] you that's why
[44:13] Christianity is more than coming to
[44:16] church Christianity is to have a
[44:19] personal
[44:20] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:23] the life of
[44:24] Christianity when you receive the word
[44:27] it gives you the
[44:29] direction in your life you don't do what
[44:32] you want because the word becomes part
[44:36] of you it becomes the center of your
[44:40] decision like in this hour that we are
[44:42] living in when there a lot of spirits
[44:45] going on the enticing Spirits the only
[44:49] thing that can control us and protect us
[44:54] it must be the word so the word should
[44:57] to take the
[44:58] preeminence in everything that we do we
[45:02] must allow the word to become our guide
[45:06] and
[45:06] our in everything that we do he says the
[45:10] word should become your
[45:12] possession every promise is
[45:15] yours God gives you a
[45:18] checkbook when you receive the Holy
[45:21] Ghost blessed name of the Lord whoever
[45:24] you receive the Holy G God gives you a
[45:26] CH
[45:28] you can use that check to receive
[45:30] anything that you
[45:32] want praise the Lord you need a personal
[45:35] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:38] because every time we gather here we are
[45:41] gathering in this building but there's
[45:43] another church again in this building
[45:47] which is the of Jesus Christ but the
[45:50] only way you can enter
[45:51] in by seeing your name when you see your
[45:55] name you can have person
[45:57] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:00] the while you look at things it changed
[46:04] even the friends you walk with they
[46:07] change bless name of the
[46:10] Lord so we need to we need to keep the
[46:14] word like the apostles kept the
[46:16] word the word should become part of
[46:19] us because the thing we
[46:22] desire when we pray we receive it in the
[46:25] name of Jesus
[46:27] he says ask anything in my
[46:29] name God will give it unto you blessed
[46:33] name of the Lord you just need to stand
[46:35] in the presence of the Lord and you say
[46:38] Lord give me Grace that I can receive
[46:40] your word that the word can become part
[46:43] of
[46:44] me blessed the Lord because the word has
[46:48] everything the word has
[46:50] Redemption bless name of the Lord once
[46:53] you reject the word praise the Lord in
[46:58] Redemption because only the word that
[47:01] can prepare you for change of your body
[47:05] the Bible says walked with
[47:08] the until the Lord took him
[47:10] home it was not just one
[47:14] day took it took 500
[47:18] years walking
[47:20] with we should never get tired of
[47:23] walking with the word because the word
[47:25] is life blessed name of the Lord we must
[47:29] receive the word with the spirit of Joy
[47:33] blessed name of the Lord and this word
[47:35] here can only be seen when it's
[47:40] manifested in in the life of a
[47:42] body praise the Lord this word can be
[47:46] manifested you can go in the place and
[47:50] you don't preach a
[47:51] message but if you are there the way you
[47:54] live
[47:58] that you
[47:59] Christian because our
[48:01] Christianity is not just talking but
[48:04] Christianity is the life we live blessed
[48:08] name of the Lord so it's our
[48:10] responsibility to keep the word in this
[48:13] age that we are living in that in all
[48:18] circumstances we become more than
[48:21] conquerors bless the name of the Lord we
[48:23] can see all the
[48:25] prophets they ested the word and once
[48:29] everybody who accepted the
[48:31] word that God gave the prophet they Reed
[48:35] their
[48:36] Redemption and those who
[48:38] rejected the word they receed their Cur
[48:42] so we are blessed people because we have
[48:45] received the message of
[48:47] the bless the Lord a prophet a prophet
[48:52] is God's reflection what a prophet is
[48:55] God's reflection
[48:57] how many who knows
[49:00] that is the prophet he reflected the
[49:04] word of
[49:05] God and we believe that we are here
[49:09] because God has sent us
[49:11] a and if God has sent us a prophet we
[49:14] have to reflect the same word that the
[49:17] prophet
[49:18] reflected the prophet become the word he
[49:21] had to feed on the W he had to eat the
[49:25] scoll until that
[49:27] word put on body so even today the word
[49:32] must embold in your
[49:35] life desire blessed the Lord because
[49:39] this word here once you take it it has
[49:42] the ability to defeat Satan any place
[49:47] anywhere any time in the days of Jesus
[49:51] praise the Lord inth 4 Jesus used the
[49:55] word defeat the
[49:57] Devil he quoted Moses man shall not live
[50:01] by bread alone but every word that comes
[50:04] from the
[50:05] m so you must stand on God's word you
[50:09] have the ability to defeat the Devil in
[50:12] every circumstance that we are going
[50:15] through the word should become
[50:17] Royal your
[50:19] tempations the word should become
[50:22] Royal trials the word should become
[50:25] Royal
[50:27] you are suffering in everything that you
[50:30] do put the word
[50:33] first that will bring
[50:35] victory in your life bless name of the
[50:38] Lord now God God wants us to deal with
[50:43] us on the basis of the
[50:45] word praise the Lord not our
[50:49] ideas praise the lord we are living in a
[50:51] very terrible hour that sometimes when
[50:55] the word is being preached
[50:57] the people goes back and they make a
[51:00] research praise the Lord you cannot make
[51:03] a research on the
[51:05] word we are called to believe because
[51:08] the Bible says all things are possible
[51:12] to that believe not all things are
[51:15] possible go
[51:17] researching begin
[51:19] researching you become an
[51:23] intellectual praise the Lord and once
[51:26] you become
[51:27] intellectual the word cannot bring a
[51:30] change bless the name of the Lord when
[51:32] the angel Gabriel came to
[51:35] Mary praise the Lord and the angel told
[51:39] Mary you are blessed among all
[51:42] women praise the Lord you are going to
[51:44] receive a SE Mary say how shall it be I
[51:49] don't name praise the Lord and the angel
[51:53] say the power from the most high shall
[51:56] come upon you and Mary said Let It Be
[52:00] according to your word so every bride
[52:04] Let It Be according to your word bless
[52:08] the Lord the prophet says that the
[52:11] greatest
[52:12] mistake that Kan made was to walk away
[52:17] from the presence of the Lord and the
[52:21] greatest mistake that you can do today
[52:24] is to walk away from the present
[52:28] blessed name of the Lord in a
[52:30] message praise the Lord the power of
[52:34] transformation he says the first thing
[52:37] he did Kan walked out from the presence
[52:41] of the
[52:42] Lord there he made his first
[52:47] mistake and there is where we make our
[52:51] mistakes when you walk away from the
[52:53] presence of the Lord that's the first m
[52:56] you
[52:58] make so if you're going to live as a
[53:01] Christian you never walk away from the
[53:05] word even if you are so weak even if you
[53:09] are so tired it's the word that has to
[53:13] give you strength because the Bible says
[53:16] that Waits upon the Lord shall renew
[53:19] their
[53:20] strength blessed the Lord we are living
[53:23] in a very terrible hour when a lot of En
[53:27] Spirit going go in this hour that we are
[53:30] living so if you don't stay with the
[53:33] word you'll find yourself are
[53:35] defeated but if you stay with the world
[53:39] you'll be an overcomer because in Christ
[53:42] Jesus we are more than
[53:44] Overcomers bless the we are walking on
[53:48] the Journey of Grace we are we are
[53:51] standing on the finished work where God
[53:55] has done everything
[53:58] we just come to believe then things can
[54:00] change our
[54:01] lives bless name of the lord it's very
[54:04] very
[54:05] important God has given us an
[54:09] inheritance God can never call
[54:11] anybody and just leave him and just
[54:14] leave him hanging not having a position
[54:19] when God calls you he gives you a
[54:22] position he gives you an inheritance and
[54:25] you know what we are holding on
[54:27] bless name of the Lord Joshua and Cal
[54:30] when they were fighting enter the promis
[54:34] land C was holding on something and
[54:37] after the battle was over he tells
[54:40] Joshua give me my Mountain so you cannot
[54:44] become you cannot be an
[54:45] overcomer without holding on the promise
[54:49] that God has given you in this day bless
[54:51] name of the
[54:52] Lord may God help us and give us
[54:58] we can never be like
[55:00] Kan Kan never kept his
[55:03] position God was a merciful
[55:05] god when Kan killed his
[55:08] brother
[55:10] immediately was worried that killed AB
[55:15] but also they are going to
[55:16] kill when
[55:19] Wasing God came down and to put a mark
[55:22] on
[55:24] him bless the Lord so it's always God's
[55:29] grace that we can stand to keep the word
[55:33] bless the
[55:35] Lord we must allow the Lord to deal with
[55:38] our
[55:39] lives so that we can reflect the message
[55:41] of the
[55:42] hour bless the
[55:48] Lord so the word operates in the
[55:52] body and when it's operating in the body
[55:55] it can be seen
[55:57] everywhere blessed name of the Lord God
[56:00] spoke the word and gave it the
[56:03] Lites to take care of
[56:05] [Music]
[56:07] it the way we
[56:09] live what we think about the people we
[56:13] stay with matters a lot to determine our
[56:17] our
[56:18] destination because we find out this day
[56:20] that we are
[56:21] living the prophet
[56:24] said in the
[56:26] SE that like the God gave Egypt time to
[56:32] repent but they fa to
[56:34] repent and all
[56:36] died and he says even today he
[56:41] pente time to rep but they dead but you
[56:46] find a Believer
[56:47] today enjoying to feed on the people who
[56:52] are dead spiritually yet there is a
[56:54] spiritual food
[56:56] in season when you listen to
[57:00] organizations your life will never
[57:02] change because the prophet say they have
[57:05] a spirit behind
[57:10] them so if you listen to
[57:14] them the blindness that they
[57:16] have it comes to
[57:20] you that's why the prophet say that's
[57:23] why you must know which voice are we
[57:25] listen
[57:29] because God has sent a
[57:31] message God has given us food there is
[57:35] spiritual food in you season these
[57:39] people are living in
[57:40] Egypt in Egypt it's just darkness it's
[57:44] just crying it's just alarming there is
[57:48] no hope there is no
[57:51] chance they are
[57:53] God is material things
[57:58] and the prophet said in the end
[58:02] time material
[58:04] things will take the place of the Holy
[58:08] Ghost and he says the hearts of the
[58:11] people will become
[58:15] called bless the name of the Lord that's
[58:17] why people can come in the presence of
[58:19] the
[58:20] Lord and they bothering about the dicks
[58:23] they having
[58:26] why it's because they are not realizing
[58:31] the position God has given
[58:34] them we must rest in this
[58:38] message because this
[58:40] message is
[58:42] rest bless the name of the Lord this
[58:45] message is
[58:46] rest we cannot struggle
[58:49] anymore when we enter in this message
[58:52] once you receive the message you have
[58:54] entered in rest
[58:56] you need to keep the
[58:58] word praise the Lord it is God's
[59:01] word when it's G when it's given to the
[59:05] ordained
[59:08] men there is no way you could be part of
[59:11] the
[59:12] work while you rejecting the CH of
[59:18] administration somebody can come to
[59:21] church I say this this I believe what
[59:24] I but this one I don't believe
[59:27] and enticing Spirits are destroing our
[59:30] churches when somebody is in church and
[59:33] having marriage
[59:35] problems he wants other people he the
[59:38] same
[59:41] problems these aning
[59:45] spirits but the purpose of our
[59:48] gathering is to unite with the
[59:53] word to wait for the change of our body
[59:57] because the greatest purpose of this
[59:59] message is to wait for the change of our
[1:00:03] bodies first seek the kingdom of God and
[1:00:06] his righteousness then other things
[1:00:09] shall be added
[1:00:10] done it's very dangerous to be in church
[1:00:14] and lack the revelation of whom you
[1:00:19] are because the victory of a Believer is
[1:00:23] to recognize your
[1:00:24] position Christ
[1:00:26] Jesus I'm called of God I'm elected of
[1:00:31] God I came from eternity and I'm going
[1:00:34] back
[1:00:35] to praise the Lord but every time we
[1:00:39] gather together we are
[1:00:41] fellowshipping about football about
[1:00:44] Arenal but Christ cannot come among us
[1:00:48] when we are felling about the things of
[1:00:51] the world we always come among us when
[1:00:54] we are talking about
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:58] every time we meet
[1:01:00] together must see the word those who are
[1:01:03] coming
[1:01:04] from they were talking about and United
[1:01:08] with them and began talking with them
[1:01:11] blessed of the Lord but every time the
[1:01:13] service is over my brother I have too
[1:01:17] many dates I don't know what to do but
[1:01:20] you have been the presence of the Lord
[1:01:23] you have not told him the Lord
[1:01:26] my trouble I'm having Lord I'm having
[1:01:31] problems in my home come down lord and
[1:01:35] bring peace in my home but every time we
[1:01:40] are just conversing about our
[1:01:42] problems then they become songs they
[1:01:45] become
[1:01:49] songs many times I wonder you you tell
[1:01:52] somebody a
[1:01:53] problem and just says
[1:01:56] sorry my brother oh sorry my sister he
[1:01:59] has not carried the
[1:02:00] burden but if you enter in prayer and
[1:02:03] you present it before the
[1:02:05] Lord all things are possible to them
[1:02:08] that believe we can change
[1:02:12] circumstances by bringing all our
[1:02:14] worries and our ab and the feet of the
[1:02:17] Lord Jesus
[1:02:19] Christ bless the name of the Lord we
[1:02:22] need to realize that we are living in a
[1:02:24] very terrible hour where as if the word
[1:02:27] is losing his
[1:02:30] power but the word never lose his
[1:02:32] power but the how you behave your
[1:02:36] conduct praise the Lord the way you
[1:02:39] behave matters a lot towards the
[1:02:43] word you must have a right
[1:02:47] attitude praise the Lord one thing that
[1:02:49] I realized that those days when we are
[1:02:52] growing
[1:02:53] here when the pastor was preaching here
[1:02:56] we are looking at him as God and
[1:03:00] anything that came from
[1:03:01] his as God has
[1:03:03] spoken and that's why you have stood up
[1:03:05] to
[1:03:06] today but these days somebody will
[1:03:09] separate this is the word of the pastor
[1:03:12] this one of
[1:03:14] God we are coming to church when they
[1:03:16] are
[1:03:18] preaching to receive the word they give
[1:03:20] it to
[1:03:21] us where there is a re we take it with
[1:03:24] happiness but these days somebody look
[1:03:27] for a
[1:03:28] court supp his
[1:03:35] weakness you are totally out of the
[1:03:38] way because once you come in the
[1:03:41] presence of the Lord you must have the
[1:03:43] spirit like of
[1:03:45] David when Prophet came to him when the
[1:03:48] word came to him he said there is a man
[1:03:51] here in your country he got a Visa
[1:03:56] and when received the V he decided to go
[1:04:00] certain man took the ship of that man
[1:04:04] and David is say is that man here if he
[1:04:08] here will be killed right now and the
[1:04:11] prop say you are the one you have been
[1:04:13] having 500 wies but you took wife and
[1:04:18] fell
[1:04:21] down he never told the prophet you don't
[1:04:24] know that I'm a king
[1:04:26] I can do what I
[1:04:29] want we must have a welcoming
[1:04:32] Spirit when the message is coming to us
[1:04:35] that's the way we can bring we can
[1:04:37] receive the change of
[1:04:38] life but we don't come with welcoming
[1:04:41] Spirit if we don't come with the
[1:04:42] welcoming Spirit to receive the message
[1:04:46] our lives canot be
[1:04:49] changed blessed name of the Lord you
[1:04:52] must know where you are
[1:04:53] standing before the Lord deals with
[1:04:57] you you must know where you are standing
[1:05:01] either you outside or you are inside
[1:05:04] blessed the Lord you must know where you
[1:05:06] are
[1:05:07] standing we must stand with the word we
[1:05:10] must allow the Lord to deal with us that
[1:05:13] God has given us
[1:05:15] Administration that gives us the message
[1:05:19] we must feed on the
[1:05:22] message but you find out these days
[1:05:25] people want to and these foreign
[1:05:29] men
[1:05:32] because the
[1:05:34] prophesying you are going to take a
[1:05:36] blessing the fire is coming your way the
[1:05:39] life is remain the same but you must
[1:05:42] understand that if you are not going
[1:05:45] through
[1:05:46] trials you have never met
[1:05:50] God the prophet said if you have ever if
[1:05:53] you have met God
[1:05:55] you have met God through the tri you go
[1:06:00] through in the message
[1:06:03] ofb more before the
[1:06:06] Lord more you go
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:11] through more before the
[1:06:13] Lord you go through because you become
[1:06:17] the
[1:06:18] reflection of the Living God bless the
[1:06:21] name of the lord it's very very
[1:06:23] important we can see
[1:06:26] that when in when Brothers of Joseph
[1:06:29] rejected
[1:06:30] him you can see what happened they end
[1:06:33] up in in in in
[1:06:35] slavery if they stayed with the
[1:06:38] word praise the Lord they were
[1:06:41] secure praise the Lord but when they
[1:06:43] rejected him when they rejected the wife
[1:06:47] of their day they they end up in
[1:06:50] slavery praise the Lord when they
[1:06:53] rejected Moses see what happened they
[1:06:57] moved in the wilderness for 40
[1:07:00] years so the only way you can enter in
[1:07:02] the
[1:07:04] prise is by keeping the word and being
[1:07:07] part of the
[1:07:08] word praise the Lord the Bible says
[1:07:11] great is he that's in
[1:07:13] you than this body which is in the
[1:07:15] world praise the lord we must keep
[1:07:19] ourselves in the word we must walk in
[1:07:22] the word the word should become part of
[1:07:24] us
[1:07:26] when they rejected
[1:07:28] Elijah judgment stri
[1:07:30] them praise the Lord
[1:07:34] when
[1:07:35] rejected Christ he missed eternal life
[1:07:39] you reject the word you miss eternal
[1:07:42] life once you receive once you receive
[1:07:45] the word you receive eternal life bless
[1:07:48] name the Lord and the prophet says etal
[1:07:51] life is living for others you cannot
[1:07:55] live for
[1:07:56] others have
[1:07:57] etal praise the Lord since God has
[1:08:00] opened up
[1:08:01] doors of witnessing we should become
[1:08:05] part of this
[1:08:06] work praying for this work supporting it
[1:08:11] because eternal life is living for
[1:08:13] others friends our
[1:08:16] problems they will not be over until we
[1:08:19] go
[1:08:20] eternity God is telling us what you have
[1:08:24] in your hands you are crying for a
[1:08:27] blessing but what have you done for
[1:08:32] me every time you are crying for the
[1:08:35] blessing but what have you done for
[1:08:41] me bless the
[1:08:44] Lord had something to show the
[1:08:48] Lord when he said prepare your you're
[1:08:50] going to
[1:08:51] die he said see the been walking
[1:08:55] I've kept your word I've done this I've
[1:08:59] done this you must do something for the
[1:09:02] Lord praise the Lord in order the lord
[1:09:05] to bless you it's very very important
[1:09:09] you can look at several
[1:09:11] people in the Bible who accepted
[1:09:15] Elijah they were blessed even the widow
[1:09:19] woman do
[1:09:21] something the Lord blesses her the word
[1:09:24] came to the Widow
[1:09:26] in the time of
[1:09:28] starving had taken over but immediately
[1:09:33] when Elijah came he said give me a
[1:09:36] dream praise the Lord after asking for
[1:09:39] the
[1:09:39] dream the wiow womaning for me to bring
[1:09:43] for me something to eat theow say I one
[1:09:49] I was going to eat it with my son and we
[1:09:52] die and Elijah say bring
[1:09:57] seek the kingdom of God
[1:09:59] [Music]
[1:10:03] his praise the Lord support the work of
[1:10:06] God in all circumstances the Lord will
[1:10:09] take care over you don't look at your
[1:10:12] problems because the problem will never
[1:10:15] be
[1:10:17] over blessed name of the Lord we must
[1:10:19] take up our
[1:10:21] position to support the work
[1:10:24] of praise
[1:10:26] because the prophet told us God is not
[1:10:29] having hands but your hands God not
[1:10:33] having eyes
[1:10:36] eyes let the word embold in
[1:10:39] you and once it comes in you life can
[1:10:43] never remain the
[1:10:44] same praise the Lord the widow woman he
[1:10:48] brought
[1:10:50] food he never looked at the
[1:10:52] circumstances but the woman could say
[1:10:55] even if Elijah eats right now even if
[1:10:58] the prophet eats right now and from I
[1:11:01] die he has a greater work to
[1:11:04] do even if I die I'm going in the
[1:11:07] presence of the
[1:11:08] Lord I'm blessed have a prophet in my
[1:11:13] house let me take food we should take it
[1:11:16] as a
[1:11:17] blessing that we have received this
[1:11:19] message so that we can support it to
[1:11:22] move in every corner
[1:11:27] the job God has given to you is for one
[1:11:30] purpose support his work because God is
[1:11:34] a business man he does not invest where
[1:11:37] he not going
[1:11:41] toest and the Bible says the faithful in
[1:11:43] the
[1:11:44] small and the faithful in the big if you
[1:11:47] cannot be
[1:11:48] faithful
[1:11:50] ,000 once you get a million you'll never
[1:11:53] be faithful
[1:11:58] the prophet talks about
[1:12:00] sister sister was so
[1:12:02] poor WID woman but they were preparing
[1:12:06] to work on the
[1:12:07] church and and sister pledged to bring
[1:12:11] money but the amount was
[1:12:13] big and the prophet felt so sorry for
[1:12:17] sister but but immediately there was a
[1:12:21] brother who talked to the prophet and
[1:12:23] said leave
[1:12:24] sister is the of the
[1:12:28] Lord paid all his
[1:12:30] bills before they reach
[1:12:36] before so when the prophet went in
[1:12:40] hunting and spoke SPS into
[1:12:43] existence the Holy Spirit led the
[1:12:46] prophet in the house of
[1:12:48] sister when the prophet was giving a
[1:12:51] testimony in church about the squ he
[1:12:55] says the Deacon of the
[1:12:57] church doubted what the prophet was
[1:12:59] saying because sister was part of the
[1:13:03] word when the prophet came in and began
[1:13:07] speaking saying is the truth the man of
[1:13:10] God it has happened and God told the
[1:13:14] prophet sister United with the
[1:13:17] word let something that she wants right
[1:13:21] now it shall be done it was the first
[1:13:24] time
[1:13:26] because the Bible
[1:13:30] says you believe the all of your
[1:13:32] heart and you confess with their lips
[1:13:36] but sister he said I want the
[1:13:39] salvation of my two boys
[1:13:42] immediately the prophet say they in your
[1:13:45] hands and the boy came and fell the feet
[1:13:49] of the prophet and receive the Holy
[1:13:51] Ghost without saying we want to receive
[1:13:53] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:57] and the prophet says that was the third
[1:13:59] pool the opening of the word so we
[1:14:02] already in the opening of the word in
[1:14:05] our hearts how can we go back to the
[1:14:09] Pentecostal looking for prophecy and
[1:14:13] T yet we have the opening of the
[1:14:17] word because once the word is inside of
[1:14:20] you you receive anything that you
[1:14:23] want but simply because you have not
[1:14:25] United with the world you are still
[1:14:27] struggling and they are telling you
[1:14:30] there is somebody this way who can
[1:14:32] prophesy about you and pray for you and
[1:14:36] your problems will vanish those are the
[1:14:38] lies of the devil those are enticing
[1:14:41] Spirit we must Unite with the word once
[1:14:45] you Unite with the word you have
[1:14:48] everything life
[1:14:50] changes Life Changes once you Unite with
[1:14:53] the word
[1:14:55] the Bible does not say that you go to
[1:14:58] the
[1:14:59] prophet and pray for you or the pastor
[1:15:02] but it says whatever thing you desire
[1:15:05] When you pray you shall receive it you
[1:15:08] must know your position in the
[1:15:10] world support the word be part of the
[1:15:14] work and the Lord will bless you bless
[1:15:17] the name of the Lord we must receive the
[1:15:19] word with the welcoming Spirit like
[1:15:23] elishah elishah
[1:15:25] was a
[1:15:27] man when he was plowing the
[1:15:31] garden immediately Elijah came and
[1:15:35] looked at him and when was when was
[1:15:39] digging his lines were
[1:15:41] straight and Elijah said see a man who
[1:15:45] does his work perfect if he comes in the
[1:15:48] word will be a perfect
[1:15:52] man and he smashed on him and
[1:15:55] immediately elishah said because of the
[1:15:59] anointing which was in Elijah he said
[1:16:02] let me go and I tell my
[1:16:05] parents then I come I follow Elijah say
[1:16:09] what have I done unto you do your work
[1:16:11] but when United with the word the life
[1:16:14] of elishah never remain the same and
[1:16:17] once you Unite with the word your life
[1:16:21] can never remain the same and
[1:16:23] immediately
[1:16:25] for the sake of the word elishah
[1:16:28] destroyed all the
[1:16:30] animals and the people ate so that can
[1:16:35] fall bless the name of the Lord he
[1:16:38] destroyed everything he was not like a
[1:16:41] Peter when Peter Jesus told
[1:16:44] him come and become fishes of
[1:16:47] me he deci
[1:16:51] tode that when this business fails
[1:16:55] I'll go back where I've come from and
[1:16:58] there are very many people in church
[1:17:00] that's their condition they are living
[1:17:02] in they are here but every time they
[1:17:06] enter in trials they are looking at
[1:17:09] theirin where they came
[1:17:16] from it's very very important once we
[1:17:19] come from those
[1:17:22] religions we must bu them
[1:17:25] we must kill them so that we can Unite
[1:17:29] with the
[1:17:30] word Peter said when the business of
[1:17:33] Jesus
[1:17:34] fails I will go back to my
[1:17:40] business blessed name of the
[1:17:42] Lord and when the time
[1:17:45] came Peter entered in a
[1:17:49] tri
[1:17:52] immediately Jesus said you are going to
[1:17:54] deny
[1:17:56] and said I cannot
[1:17:58] deny but when time
[1:18:01] came the people began pointing
[1:18:03] at have you not been with
[1:18:07] Jesus and began walking out he went back
[1:18:10] to his business but we thank God that
[1:18:13] still Grace when he was going Grace went
[1:18:17] with him and brought him back even this
[1:18:21] morning there is still Grace in the
[1:18:24] presence of the Lord in the presence of
[1:18:26] the Lord there is still Grace that can
[1:18:29] help you to unite with the
[1:18:34] word blessed name of the lord it's very
[1:18:38] very important to understand that we are
[1:18:41] living in a different
[1:18:44] Covenant and this Covenant is the
[1:18:47] Covenant of Grace he has done
[1:18:50] everything praise the lord we need to
[1:18:53] unite with the word
[1:18:55] so elishah follow
[1:18:57] Elijah praise the Lord until the life
[1:19:00] which was in
[1:19:01] Elijah came in Elisha and that's how
[1:19:05] this morning that the life which was in
[1:19:07] the prophet is the same life that should
[1:19:11] be in
[1:19:12] us not just speaking about the
[1:19:15] word or hearers of the word should be
[1:19:18] doers of
[1:19:19] the may God give us Grace this
[1:19:22] morning kindness to the ministry
[1:19:26] can give you eternal
[1:19:28] life you cannot be part of the
[1:19:32] church when you only speak evil things
[1:19:34] about the
[1:19:35] church about brothers and about sisters
[1:19:40] and the prophet says you kill the
[1:19:42] influence of the church we must learn to
[1:19:46] speak good things about our
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:19:52] church because when if you talk about
[1:19:55] your
[1:19:56] home you are not shifting you're not
[1:19:59] shifting from it you are part of that
[1:20:01] family even if your father is a
[1:20:04] drunker talking about him does not
[1:20:07] change anything he remains your
[1:20:13] father we must learn
[1:20:16] respect our mother our mother which is
[1:20:21] dischar and respect our father
[1:20:25] who is the
[1:20:27] pastor that's the principle
[1:20:31] friends if we are going to leave as
[1:20:34] Overcomers we must keep the
[1:20:37] word bless name the Lord we want to go
[1:20:40] in Marth chapter 13 verse
[1:20:43] 23 kindness to the
[1:20:46] ministry it gives you eternal
[1:20:51] life the Bible says Marth
[1:20:55] 13:23 but he that receives the seed in
[1:20:58] the good ground is he that hears the
[1:21:01] word and understand
[1:21:04] seed which also bears fruit brings forth
[1:21:08] much 100 fold Psalm
[1:21:12] 60 Psalm
[1:21:15] 30 and Psalm 100 no
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:32] and this is where the battle is when we
[1:21:34] come to
[1:21:35] church the devil will allow you to leave
[1:21:37] your
[1:21:38] home and you come to church but as you
[1:21:41] are sitting there the word is going on
[1:21:45] it begins it begins telling you on
[1:21:48] Monday the guys of black are coming for
[1:22:01] because he knows once you
[1:22:04] miss to see your portion in the word you
[1:22:08] are
[1:22:11] defeated sometimes even the prophet says
[1:22:14] that once you receive the
[1:22:16] word when you go back in your home the
[1:22:20] devil is waiting for you on the way to
[1:22:24] challenge you on what you have
[1:22:29] received bless the name of the Lord so
[1:22:32] you must have the ability of receiving
[1:22:34] the
[1:22:35] seed in the good ground not the ston
[1:22:39] ground not the side
[1:22:42] way praise the Lord and he says You must
[1:22:46] have an
[1:22:47] understanding of what the word has
[1:22:50] said you hear
[1:22:53] it and understand it it brings
[1:22:57] fruits it changes your life it Chang the
[1:23:01] while you look at
[1:23:03] things praise the Lord so the while you
[1:23:06] receive the word you remember in The
[1:23:09] Message
[1:23:11] Church the prophet says Satan comes as a
[1:23:14] robbing
[1:23:15] Spirit hold fast what you have in your
[1:23:19] hand that no man should take away what
[1:23:23] you have
[1:23:25] he comes as a robbing
[1:23:27] Spirit everywhere we go we can feel this
[1:23:32] robbing spirits who has thr the word
[1:23:34] from
[1:23:35] us the enticing
[1:23:38] Spirits there are many praise the Lord
[1:23:41] may God help us that we can take up a
[1:23:44] position of allowing the Lord take the
[1:23:47] first
[1:23:49] PR in our
[1:23:51] lives we should allow God to our lives
[1:23:54] in the message the end time
[1:24:00] sign he says then you say well Jesus
[1:24:04] healed the
[1:24:07] sick and the prophet says he is the
[1:24:11] word he is the word when you receive the
[1:24:15] word you receive Jesus Christ for he is
[1:24:19] the word once you receive the word you
[1:24:23] receive Jesus Christ
[1:24:25] because Jesus is the word the word was
[1:24:29] made flesh and DW among us and we
[1:24:33] believe that praise the lord we believe
[1:24:36] every bit of it we believe that Christ
[1:24:40] is is God's
[1:24:42] word made
[1:24:44] manifest and we believe that his bride
[1:24:48] must be the same
[1:24:50] thing the Bride of God must be the
[1:24:55] same like the Jesus was the same
[1:24:59] thing was the same praise the
[1:25:03] Lord and we believe that his
[1:25:05] bride must be the same
[1:25:08] thing and we believe that she must she
[1:25:12] must believe every bit of the
[1:25:15] word not a half of the
[1:25:19] word bless name of the Lord every bit of
[1:25:23] the word
[1:25:24] not a half of the word you need to take
[1:25:27] the entire
[1:25:29] word God has given
[1:25:33] itto blessed name of the Lord and once
[1:25:36] you take him that
[1:25:37] way change comes in your
[1:25:43] life you have that word in
[1:25:47] her because she is part of the she is
[1:25:50] part of the
[1:25:52] body she is the body where he is the
[1:25:56] head you become the body and Christ
[1:26:00] becomes the
[1:26:02] head we must allow the word to deal with
[1:26:07] our lives in every
[1:26:10] Circumstance the word should take the
[1:26:13] first praise the Lord we thank God for
[1:26:16] the message of the
[1:26:18] hour that God has called us in this day
[1:26:21] that we are living in that we no longer
[1:26:25] desire to be to desire for the people
[1:26:27] goes on
[1:26:31] mixing because it's the age of
[1:26:33] mixing praise the Lord but we must only
[1:26:36] stay with the
[1:26:40] word Jesus had a perfect
[1:26:43] faith and he had it it it come because
[1:26:48] he was the
[1:26:50] word they had the perfect
[1:26:52] Faith he had it
[1:26:55] it come because he he was the
[1:26:58] word and you become the word you become
[1:27:02] the word as you receive the
[1:27:06] word you become the word as you receive
[1:27:09] the
[1:27:10] word so that's why many times we have to
[1:27:14] come
[1:27:15] prepared the service begins in our
[1:27:18] homes the service does not begin from
[1:27:21] here it begins from our homes
[1:27:24] Lord I'm coming in your presence but may
[1:27:27] you deal with me Lord may you use the
[1:27:29] minister Lord I Sur my life bless the
[1:27:34] Lord when you receive the word you

[1:27:40] word praise the Lord when you receive
[1:27:43] the
[1:27:44] word you you become the word Jesus said
[1:27:48] if you AB in
[1:27:50] me and my words in you
[1:27:54] Words which is the
[1:27:56] word abids in you then ask whatsoever

[1:35:20] things which are not real
[1:35:25] once you receive the Lord Jesus
[1:35:28] Christ who is the word all your sins all
[1:35:32] your sins is thrown in the S
[1:35:39] forgetfulness but people are Desiring

[1:36:09] word you shall know the truth and the
[1:36:12] truth shall set
[1:36:13] you listen the lord it's very very
[1:36:16] important to know that God has given us
[1:36:19] a good
[1:36:20] church and a good Ministry
[1:36:23] appreciate God for
[1:36:26] it praying for it and knowing that the
[1:36:31] responsibility is upon us to continue
[1:36:35] taking up this
[1:36:37] light in different
[1:36:39] places at the place of work in your home
[1:36:43] praise the
[1:36:44] lord it's very very important to allow
[1:36:48] the Lord to deal with our lives
[1:36:53] the prophet
[1:36:55] says now it is the holy spirit in the
[1:36:57] last
[1:36:59] day to shine forth the evening
[1:37:04] light restoring back the
[1:37:07] faith that's what he's
[1:37:10] doing bring back the oral
[1:37:14] Faith the oral Bible
[1:37:18] Faith the original Bible believing every
[1:37:22] word of it praise the Lord taking it
[1:37:28] back that's what the Lord is
[1:37:32] doing we must always stay in the
[1:37:35] presence of the
[1:37:36] Lord by saying Lord give me Grace to
[1:37:41] stand Before You When I'm Not
[1:37:45] Afraid once you have the word you have
[1:37:49] everything the enticing Spirits are
[1:37:51] robbing our joy in our homes
[1:37:57] because we want to compare
[1:38:01] ourselves but we are not being called to
[1:38:03] compare
[1:38:05] ourselves we have to compare
[1:38:07] ourselves with the
[1:38:11] word blessed of the lord it's very very
[1:38:14] important to keep ourselves in such
[1:38:19] position in such
[1:38:21] position I want to wind up bless name of
[1:38:24] the
[1:38:25] Lord so God is calling
[1:38:28] us for one purpose to unite with the
[1:38:31] word so that we can be we we can be
[1:38:34] ready for the change of our
[1:38:36] bodies he calls us he calls us to give
[1:38:40] us a
[1:38:41] position and God wants you to identify
[1:38:43] himself he wants you to identify
[1:38:45] yourself with
[1:38:48] him he says you shall dwell in this
[1:38:51] land I'll that I give gave unto your
[1:38:54] fathers and you shall be my people and I
[1:38:58] will be your God but when God is dealing
[1:39:00] with you toite with the word he wants
[1:39:05] you to separate
[1:39:06] yourself when the word is going toite
[1:39:08] with
[1:39:09] you looks at your
[1:39:12] attitude people wants the Holy Spirit
[1:39:16] but they don't want to be
[1:39:19] changed the attitud change
[1:39:23] thinking when he was in the
[1:39:25] religion the want to think in the
[1:39:30] message bless the name of the Lord and
[1:39:33] you see you have to understand many
[1:39:35] times people thinks that
[1:39:38] repentance just coming to say oh forgive
[1:39:41] me
[1:39:42] please repentance is change of
[1:39:46] attitude like thetical
[1:39:48] son he changed the attitude the Bible
[1:39:52] says when was there
[1:39:54] suffering eating the food of the
[1:39:57] pigs he came to himself he came to
[1:40:00] himself and said how long I be in this
[1:40:04] condition when the Servants of my father
[1:40:08] are eating well he said no I not remain
[1:40:11] in this condition I must return back and
[1:40:14] I go to my father change of
[1:40:18] attitude brought him back home change of
[1:40:21] attitude made
[1:40:23] father be ready to receive him change of
[1:40:28] your atude makes God be ready to receive
[1:40:32] you any time any hour if you have
[1:40:36] changed
[1:40:41] your bless the name of the Lord so
[1:40:44] sometimes we fail because of lack of
[1:40:46] change
[1:40:49] of so
[1:40:51] repentance is changing
[1:40:57] you have been taken this way and the
[1:40:59] Lord says turn
[1:41:03] please bless name the Lord and that's
[1:41:06] what Jesus said If any man comes after
[1:41:08] me let him take up the cross and follow
[1:41:13] me you take up the cross and the prophet
[1:41:16] says
[1:41:18] Christianity is a
[1:41:20] self-denial if you say you want to unite
[1:41:22] with the wife
[1:41:24] you first deny your
[1:41:27] life blessed the Lord so change of
[1:41:30] attitude brings change of
[1:41:36] character bless the name of the Lord
[1:41:38] change of
[1:41:40] attitude brings change of
[1:41:45] character it brings the
[1:41:47] faith that makes us separate
[1:41:50] ourselves from the people who can hinder
[1:41:54] us from uniting with the
[1:41:56] word in the Old Testament Israel
[1:42:01] separated from the natural
[1:42:05] land they are to separate from the
[1:42:08] natural land praise the Lord but today
[1:42:12] we separate ourselves praise the Lord in
[1:42:15] a spiritual
[1:42:18] way bless the name of the lord it's very
[1:42:21] very important so that we can
[1:42:24] Unite with the
[1:42:27] word the prophet
[1:42:31] says now all those types of of the
[1:42:36] old they were just Shadows of the
[1:42:39] things to come I believe that I believe
[1:42:43] that I believe that was the church in in
[1:42:49] natural the Jewish church was brought
[1:42:53] out of
[1:42:59] Egypt blessed the Lord who had the
[1:43:03] natural law that church natural
[1:43:06] law but
[1:43:08] today God's spiritual
[1:43:11] church with a spiritual law written on
[1:43:15] the tables of their
[1:43:19] hearts LED in the spiritual form
[1:43:23] what is laid on the spiritual
[1:43:26] for now it looked up to see where the
[1:43:30] pillar of fire
[1:43:32] was the angel of the
[1:43:37] Lord but we do not look
[1:43:41] today there is something
[1:43:44] happening that we know that is there so
[1:43:48] those on are dealing with things which
[1:43:49] are natural
[1:43:53] spiritual way there is something that
[1:43:55] the Lord is doing right
[1:43:58] now bless name of the Lord so you must
[1:44:01] be spiritual enough in order to see what
[1:44:05] the Lord is
[1:44:06] doing enticing Spirits are going on
[1:44:10] everywhere but we must keep the word
[1:44:13] that's the way we going to defeat
[1:44:15] them Joseph in
[1:44:18] circumstances of being in Egypt he
[1:44:22] defeated every
[1:44:24] by keeping the
[1:44:27] word bless name of the
[1:44:29] Lord but these days the Youth of these
[1:44:33] days once he get such an
[1:44:36] opportunity he says I'm
[1:44:39] resting but was not
[1:44:41] Joseph Joseph kept the word because he
[1:44:45] knew was climbing the mountain at the
[1:44:48] end of the road he knew there was joy
[1:44:50] for him
[1:44:53] blessed name of the Lord there has to be
[1:44:55] a life of a
[1:44:57] sacrifice praise the Lord because
[1:44:59] there's something that's happening right
[1:45:02] now he
[1:45:04] says there were the people of
[1:45:08] God Israel down in
[1:45:11] Egypt they were the people of
[1:45:15] God till they came out of
[1:45:18] Egypt they were the people of God when
[1:45:21] they were still in Egypt
[1:45:23] and started towards the promised
[1:45:26] land then they became the Church of
[1:45:29] God the word church means called
[1:45:34] out I love that we are called out praise
[1:45:39] the Lord from Babylon to enter in the
[1:45:42] promised line toite with the word I love
[1:45:46] that separated ones God said God said
[1:45:52] separate
[1:45:53] separate me
[1:45:55] and to do the work that I've called them
[1:45:59] to do so he has called you to unite with
[1:46:03] the word so that you can do his work if
[1:46:06] you cannot Unite with the word you
[1:46:09] cannot do his work blessing name of the
[1:46:11] Lord there is a level of
[1:46:14] Separation God separated
[1:46:17] Israel and made them a holy
[1:46:20] nation so what Israel was in the Old
[1:46:22] Testament
[1:46:25] God is what is what God is
[1:46:27] doing in the New Testament
[1:46:30] Church what he did in the Old
[1:46:32] Testament is what he's doing right now
[1:46:36] separating us so that we can Unite with
[1:46:38] the
[1:46:39] word blessed the Lord this is what the
[1:46:42] prophet says in the message
[1:46:45] Jehovah now you see where the
[1:46:47] Pentecostal church is
[1:46:50] today he says the
[1:46:54] weakness
[1:46:56] weakness that's right he says that once
[1:46:59] you look at them they are full of
[1:47:01] weaknesses just dropping along like
[1:47:05] flies praise the Lord falling off
[1:47:10] themselves the younger people are
[1:47:12] running
[1:47:16] for they are running for such
[1:47:19] people ministers
[1:47:24] who can speak things in
[1:47:25] existence who are
[1:47:27] intellectual but the prophet is saying
[1:47:30] they are falling like
[1:47:34] flies you must have spiritual
[1:47:37] eyes the prophet says you cannot go in
[1:47:39] the
[1:47:41] restaurant and they bring for you fish
[1:47:44] or food when the coach is there and you
[1:47:51] eat oh obviously you know that once you
[1:47:55] eat the food which is having
[1:47:58] Co you are going to get
[1:48:00] sick but spiritually the Believers are
[1:48:03] not afraid they eat everything
[1:48:11] that anything that
[1:48:14] comes too much fire is going on but they
[1:48:18] don't stand and they say where is this
[1:48:20] fire coming
[1:48:23] who has begun it the sons of
[1:48:26] Aaron they brought Strange Fire and that
[1:48:30] Strange
[1:48:31] Fire brought death in the
[1:48:34] camp we die spiritually because we look
[1:48:37] for the Str
[1:48:40] fire and that Str fire kills you
[1:48:47] Spirit that's why we must have a
[1:48:51] standard we must have a
[1:48:54] standard of what we listen
[1:48:58] to and what we feed
[1:49:01] on bless the name of the lord it's very
[1:49:04] very
[1:49:05] important because the hour we are living
[1:49:08] in is a very terrible
[1:49:14] hour praise the lord we bless the Lord
[1:49:18] for his
[1:49:19] goodness that he has called us for a
[1:49:21] purpose
[1:49:26] when he called
[1:49:27] Abraham praise the Lord Abraham knew the
[1:49:31] voice of
[1:49:33] God and when he fell
[1:49:36] from the promised
[1:49:38] land he
[1:49:40] understood that I'm in the wrong
[1:49:45] place we must have a standard of the
[1:49:49] word when you see that something is
[1:49:51] influencing you
[1:49:54] you say uhuh let me stop
[1:49:57] here football is taking me Beyond where
[1:50:00] I have to
[1:50:04] stop
[1:50:05] blessed and the prophet says that many
[1:50:09] times people do not enter in the
[1:50:14] spirit the spirit of Christ that's why
[1:50:18] they cannot be
[1:50:20] connected with Christ because even the
[1:50:23] things of the world you enter in their
[1:50:27] Spirits when you see the PO
[1:50:30] bicycles you find bigger
[1:50:33] men closing up their shops and they
[1:50:36] watching the
[1:50:39] bicycles they have enter in the
[1:50:44] spirit people of
[1:50:46] football they enter in the
[1:50:49] spirit he leaves his home at night
[1:50:53] and goes in the
[1:50:54] film he wants to watch
[1:50:57] man recently a man died in
[1:50:59] may he has been a
[1:51:02] manager in a pet
[1:51:05] station but he loved so much
[1:51:08] baiting so that time went in the
[1:51:11] film and they had put those things of
[1:51:14] baiting 1
[1:51:17] million when he had put in that money he
[1:51:21] Lo he lost
[1:51:32] he claps from
[1:51:38] there bless
[1:51:41] the so the people of the world enters in
[1:51:43] the
[1:51:45] spirit when they are doing those
[1:51:48] things look
[1:51:49] at when they enter that spirit even if
[1:51:52] you're not part of them and you are
[1:51:55] cooking at home but when they
[1:51:57] begin also you live there the
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:03] food you
[1:52:05] reach I've let me go
[1:52:10] back we must have such an
[1:52:13] anointing that even at the place of work
[1:52:16] the people who surrounds us we can
[1:52:18] influence them and they believe what we
[1:52:20] believe
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:25] we must enter in the spirit of the
[1:52:28] word blessed name of the Lord so that
[1:52:31] the word can become
[1:52:33] Royal that our sons and daughters can
[1:52:36] become part of the
[1:52:38] word it's very
[1:52:40] dangerous to talk about the word but
[1:52:43] when you're not doing the
[1:52:46] word we need to
[1:52:48] talk what we
[1:52:51] do it brings an impact upon our
[1:52:55] families L the Lord so you find out
[1:52:58] people they watching
[1:53:00] football on
[1:53:04] television but the body is here but the
[1:53:07] spirit is where
[1:53:11] is so we are sitting here but our
[1:53:15] Spirits be in the presence of
[1:53:20] the because somebody just
[1:53:23] watching watching a
[1:53:25] television and says you find out that
[1:53:28] people have never gone to
[1:53:30] school they can count all the lineups of
[1:53:33] those
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:35] players and the coach and the
[1:53:38] money and the
[1:53:43] money they have entered in the
[1:53:47] spirit but we Christians the prophet
[1:53:50] says many times we fail to enter in the
[1:53:54] spirit of
[1:53:58] Christ but once we enter in the spirit
[1:54:00] of
[1:54:01] Christ the life can never remain the
[1:54:05] same you can know your
[1:54:07] position where you are standing you
[1:54:10] become an
[1:54:12] overcomer you can imagine once somebody
[1:54:15] enters in the
[1:54:16] spirit he does not think about his
[1:54:21] titles when he's watching football oh
[1:54:24] Ron
[1:54:28] Ron he has entered in the SP once you
[1:54:31] enter in the spirit of Christ you not
[1:54:34] think about your
[1:54:36] titles you are
[1:54:39] failur your
[1:54:41] worries they they rolled
[1:54:43] away we must enter in the spirit of CHR
[1:54:47] in order by uniting with the
[1:54:49] word bless the Lord
[1:54:52] and when when did Abraham's seed lose
[1:54:56] this greater
[1:54:59] Fellowship when it went down in
[1:55:03] Egypt he never lost his
[1:55:06] Covenant but he lost his
[1:55:09] Blessing that is what I'm trying to get
[1:55:12] to you people
[1:55:14] tonight the Pentecostal
[1:55:16] church has lost its form of
[1:55:20] blessing there is something wrong
[1:55:23] there is something wrong and we know
[1:55:26] that everybody that ever read the
[1:55:29] history of the church knows that there
[1:55:32] is
[1:55:34] something there there is
[1:55:36] something wrong within the
[1:55:39] church now you have now you have lost
[1:55:43] your now you now now you have not lost
[1:55:46] your
[1:55:48] Covenant but you have lost your
[1:55:51] blessings
[1:55:54] once you fail to unite with the
[1:55:57] word you are losing your
[1:56:00] blessings because the promise of God
[1:56:03] is I'll bless you and I'll make you a
[1:56:08] blessing you yourself you become a
[1:56:11] blessing among the people where you stay
[1:56:15] to your neighbors not only being
[1:56:18] blessed become a bless
[1:56:22] when you Unite with the
[1:56:24] word blessed name of the Lord we must
[1:56:27] allow God to deal with our
[1:56:29] lives because has called us for a
[1:56:32] purpose staying in the
[1:56:35] word is our
[1:56:38] separation when you stay in the
[1:56:41] word that's your
[1:56:43] separation blessed the Lord we must
[1:56:46] allow God to deal with our lives there
[1:56:51] is a purpose for your
[1:56:53] calling God has not called you when he's
[1:56:57] not having a purpose in your
[1:57:00] life when he calls
[1:57:03] you he has a purpose for you and it's
[1:57:06] your
[1:57:07] responsibility to go in the presence of
[1:57:09] the Lord and you tell him Lord what is
[1:57:13] your purpose for my
[1:57:17] life talk to him you cannot wake up in
[1:57:20] the morning and you going somebody's
[1:57:22] garden and You Begin digging and you
[1:57:25] tell the person you pay
[1:57:31] me bless name of the Lord so you need to
[1:57:34] enter in the presence of the
[1:57:36] Lord and you talk to him bless the it's
[1:57:40] very very
[1:57:42] important so we want to
[1:57:47] go in look
[1:57:53] chapter
[1:57:55] 8 and verse
[1:57:58] 15 the Bible
[1:58:00] says but that on the good ground are
[1:58:04] they which in unhonest good heart having
[1:58:09] heard the word keep it brings forth
[1:58:12] fruit with patience
[1:58:26] praise the Lord he says those the seeds
[1:58:29] which are in the good
[1:58:31] ground they are which are with
[1:58:35] unhonest with a good
[1:58:37] heart having heard the word after they
[1:58:41] have heard the word they keep it they
[1:58:44] bring forth fruits with
[1:58:47] patience once you Unite with a
[1:58:50] word with the honest
[1:58:55] he
[1:58:56] says and you keep it you bring forth
[1:58:59] fruits with
[1:59:03] patience blessed name of the Lord
[1:59:06] patience is
[1:59:07] needed in this hour that we are living
[1:59:10] in people are losing the
[1:59:13] battle because of lack of
[1:59:17] patience blessing of the Lord but once
[1:59:20] you walking with the word
[1:59:23] you need say Lord give me the spirit of
[1:59:27] patience praise the Lord give me the
[1:59:31] spirit of
[1:59:32] patience that I can overcome the
[1:59:35] circumstances that are surrounding me
[1:59:38] Lord I know your grace will do it for me
[1:59:42] blessed name of the Lord we should keep
[1:59:45] ourselves close to the word because time
[1:59:48] is no more one of these days we are
[1:59:52] going back in
[1:59:53] eternity I want
[1:59:57] to when God called
[2:00:00] Joshua the high priest in the book of
[2:00:03] Zar
[2:00:05] 3 he came with
[2:00:13] with but recognize that God has called
[2:00:17] him he was not afraid of what will come
[2:00:21] his way
[2:00:22] since is God has called
[2:00:24] him and when was standing there the
[2:00:28] devil began rebuking him because of
[2:00:31] the but God himself said is me who has
[2:00:37] chosen and God commanded take gments
[2:00:40] from josua give him new
[2:00:44] clothes when God calls you he takes out
[2:00:47] the that
[2:00:48] Gars and gives you the new clothes
[2:00:53] we should have
[2:00:54] confidence in our calling God is
[2:00:59] responsible for your Purity BL name of
[2:01:02] the Lord he has given us the blood that
[2:01:05] shall never lose his
[2:01:06] power praise alone to take away all our
[2:01:10] sins because in Ephesians 5 verse 26 he
[2:01:16] says that he may sanctify us to clean us
[2:01:19] to clean to clean eat with the washing
[2:01:22] Waters of the
[2:01:24] world that he may present it
[2:01:27] himself as a glorious Church it is God
[2:01:30] who makes it
[2:01:32] possible for me to obey the word praise
[2:01:36] the Lord to unite with the wife who have
[2:01:40] faith in God's
[2:01:41] word prise the Lord because the Bible
[2:01:44] says the just shall live by
[2:01:48] fa so everything is happening
[2:01:52] it's the Lord who is doing
[2:01:54] it we must rest in the hands of the
[2:01:58] Lord praise the
[2:02:02] Lord in the message
[2:02:06] Abram's we must remember always that
[2:02:09] salvation is of the
[2:02:11] Lord young
[2:02:14] people the parents have done their
[2:02:18] work to show you the way but he must
[2:02:21] take the
[2:02:22] responsibility of saying Lord open up my
[2:02:26] eyes you must have a personal
[2:02:34] experience Jesus defeated the devil on
[2:02:37] the
[2:02:39] word if thou be the Son of
[2:02:42] God command those stones to be turned to
[2:02:47] bread said it's
[2:02:49] written Jesus said it's written
[2:02:52] man shall not live by bread
[2:02:54] alone so he defeated
[2:02:57] Satan praise the Lord he defeated him
[2:03:01] with the word of
[2:03:02] God yourself you defe sat when you stand
[2:03:07] on God
[2:03:08] word you must learn the to use the
[2:03:13] word bless name of the Lord because the
[2:03:16] word is spirit and life learn the world
[2:03:21] to use it the word is not a Doctrine the
[2:03:25] word is not a do but the word is spirit
[2:03:28] and
[2:03:29] life Jesus Jesus told the disciples the
[2:03:32] words that I speak unto you in spirit
[2:03:35] and life so God is word is spirit and
[2:03:39] life so Jesus defeated the
[2:03:42] Devil by using God's word that is how we
[2:03:46] can defeat
[2:03:47] him is by the word of God that says the
[2:03:51] Lord
[2:03:52] praise the Lord and once you stand on
[2:03:54] that you overcome the enemy
[2:03:58] Satan stand on the word God is faithful
[2:04:03] to keep his word bless the name of the
[2:04:06] lord it's a matter of believing it asite
[2:04:10] with it a man who was on the pool for 38
[2:04:15] years not throw himself
[2:04:17] in when Jesus came he used the word C up
[2:04:22] your bed and go the man believed it and
[2:04:26] he carried the bed and he walked away
[2:04:29] the Lord there's no there's no need of
[2:04:33] lamenting praise the Lord and crying
[2:04:36] just use the word you are going to
[2:04:42] defeat when they came on the Red Sea
[2:04:45] they were crying and God told Moses why
[2:04:49] Christ
[2:04:50] speak SE the word that the can be
[2:04:54] created in the Red Sea you have to keep
[2:04:57] the word that's the way you're going to
[2:04:59] overcome the
[2:05:01] devil bless the Lord in the message the
[2:05:05] revelation of Jesus
[2:05:08] Christ you have to remember anything
[2:05:12] thing God making you an
[2:05:17] overcomer he relases the
[2:05:20] revelation of knowledge
[2:05:24] and
[2:05:26] revelation of the
[2:05:28] knowledge of Christ it is our
[2:05:32] salvation and our
[2:05:34] Victory once brings that
[2:05:37] Revelation he says now you now you can
[2:05:40] know why it says that everyone who reads
[2:05:44] or hears it is blessed
[2:05:52] anybody who hears the
[2:05:54] word and reads it he says is
[2:05:57] blessed it is the revelation of God that
[2:06:01] will give you the
[2:06:04] authority over the devil the
[2:06:07] word once you get the revelation of the
[2:06:10] word will give you the
[2:06:13] authority over the devil because you
[2:06:15] know where you are
[2:06:18] standing you can see why who would add
[2:06:22] or take away from it would be
[2:06:28] cast it would have to be
[2:06:30] so for who can add or take away from
[2:06:33] from the perfect revelation of
[2:06:38] God and overcome the
[2:06:40] enemy so you cannot take away the
[2:06:44] perfect
[2:06:45] revelation of God and you expect to
[2:06:48] overcome the eny
[2:06:51] overcome the enemy when you take the
[2:06:54] entire
[2:06:57] Revelation blessed name of the
[2:07:03] Lord so
[2:07:05] Revelation is the greatest tool against
[2:07:11] Satan he told Peter
[2:07:14] upon where I build my
[2:07:16] church and the g of Hell shall not
[2:07:20] Prevail against
[2:07:23] it's God himself who will make the bride
[2:07:27] tree
[2:07:29] fruitful that's why we are living in the
[2:07:31] hour of uniting with the word praise the
[2:07:34] Lord to be in Psalms
[2:07:38] 1:1 planted by the rivers of
[2:07:42] water even if it's raining is still
[2:07:46] drinking even if it's shining is still
[2:07:49] drinking we must be a tree

[2:17:25] USIS is the life we
[2:17:29] live amen your life is
[2:17:34] chistian stay
[2:17:37] somewhere
[2:17:42] people you have not
[2:17:44] preached they have seen
[2:17:47] something amen amen sometimes I go
[2:17:53] somewhere ask
[2:17:55] me are you a
[2:17:57] teacher then I
[2:18:00] wonder what have they seen maybe the
[2:18:03] life of a
[2:18:06] teacher do they see chisan in
[2:18:09] us our brothers also told
[2:18:13] us put everything we
[2:18:16] do in the
[2:18:19] word he yes
[2:18:21] said do not research on the
[2:18:26] word but believe the
[2:18:30] word amen our
[2:18:37] education no
[2:18:39] research which we get
[2:18:43] in here
[2:18:47] believing
[2:18:49] amen we must allow the Lord to live in
[2:18:52] our lives we must
[2:18:56] allow the Lord to live in our
[2:19:00] lives then he asked us a very important
[2:19:05] question which voice are you listening
[2:19:10] to I'm also asking
[2:19:13] also which songs do you listen
[2:19:17] to which terms do you use in your daily
[2:19:20] language
[2:19:29] I I don't fear
[2:19:31] l i don't
[2:19:35] hurry Uncle s you
[2:19:39] know which which terms do you
[2:19:43] use in your
[2:19:46] language what confessions do we do
[2:19:53] what
[2:19:57] do are we
[2:20:00] there so the brothers asked us what do
[2:20:04] you listen
[2:20:07] to I wanted to expand it a
[2:20:10] bit songs we listen
[2:20:13] TOS we
[2:20:16] use the names we give
[2:20:19] ourselves maybe the groups we move
[2:20:24] with young
[2:20:26] people which group do you move
[2:20:30] with but even
[2:20:32] us which group do you sit with in the
[2:20:38] evening okay then he says
[2:20:42] attitude is
[2:20:45] important towards the
[2:20:49] word when we start saying that word they
[2:20:53] preach and say that one is from God that
[2:20:55] word is from
[2:20:57] God that one is from the
[2:21:02] pastor's then we are
[2:21:04] finished let us believe every
[2:21:08] word having a welcoming
[2:21:11] spirit and becoming a
[2:21:16] reflection of God of Jesus Christ
[2:21:18] himself
[2:21:21] amen becoming being
[2:21:26] blessed and becoming a
[2:21:30] blessing
[2:21:33] coming without hiding the
[2:21:37] Nets when
[2:21:41] things I go back to my
[2:21:46] fishing those Nets
[2:21:50] amen amen if this church
[2:21:54] fails I will go back to my previous
[2:21:58] Church even call it my
[2:22:08] prchs are we there amen amen we must he
[2:22:14] has also told
[2:22:16] us we must learn to respect our mother
[2:22:28] father
[2:22:31] the amen is not saying God is Not is God
[2:22:36] is the p is replacing to be your
[2:22:43] father uh-uh the preacher is not saying
[2:22:47] that the pastor has taken the place of
[2:22:49] God
[2:22:54] saying
[2:22:59] that the person leading
[2:23:04] us that's why he's calling him our
[2:23:09] father leading us in our
[2:23:12] mother mother called the
