[2:01:23] here and speak to the Bride of Jesus
[2:01:27] Christ amen we know one another for
[2:01:29] quite some
[2:01:31] years we know one another for some years
[2:01:34] already amen and uh and it's good to to
[2:01:38] get to know one
[2:01:41] another not after the
[2:01:44] flesh amen I'm not really a
[2:01:50] German oh
[2:01:52] amen amen I'm not really a
[2:01:55] German this outside flesh is German
[2:01:59] yes but I come from
[2:02:03] eternity eternity is my
[2:02:06] home I trust I trust your home is also
[2:02:11] eternity and we are on our way back
[2:02:15] home home where we come from we come
[2:02:18] from God because he is the only one that
[2:02:21] is eternal
[2:02:24] and we going back to
[2:02:25] God Amen it is so wonderful to meet one
[2:02:28] another
[2:02:30] again seeing through all those years
[2:02:33] seeing through all those
[2:02:36] years how how the bride is
[2:02:40] maturing amen maturing in the
[2:02:44] word amen remember I remember not
[2:02:47] remember but I can think of my first
[2:02:48] time being here in Uganda
[2:02:52] uh I don't count the years so I don't
[2:02:53] know how many years ago it
[2:02:57] was but I think it was some full moons
[2:03:00] ago some full moons
[2:03:05] ago full moons ago some years
[2:03:09] ago amen amen it was some years
[2:03:13] ago amen so we not only become
[2:03:17] older but I believe the Bride of Jesus
[2:03:20] Christ has become more mature
[2:03:24] and we can speak today of
[2:03:26] things that we couldn't speak 10 years
[2:03:30] ago amen I believe we're living in a
[2:03:33] wonderful
[2:03:34] time are you not happy to be a Christian
[2:03:37] today to live
[2:03:42] today I know there's many things
[2:03:44] happening which is uh which is difficult
[2:03:47] to
[2:03:50] understand we have same in Europe and
[2:03:53] Germany our in our
[2:03:56] church we still suffer death sometimes
[2:03:59] death
[2:04:01] comes not only in of old age but also
[2:04:04] with with young
[2:04:06] people and many times we don't
[2:04:09] understand but God has a
[2:04:12] plan and I want to encourage each and
[2:04:15] everyone just stay in God's
[2:04:18] plan and then he will work it out
[2:04:22] because finally the Bible
[2:04:24] said all things work together for the
[2:04:28] good amen all things not all things are
[2:04:33] good but all things work together for
[2:04:36] the
[2:04:37] good to them that love God do you love
[2:04:42] God and to
[2:04:45] them that has a purpose that is
[2:04:49] ordained and that's not that's not your
[2:04:52] plan that's God's plan that's God's
[2:04:55] grace to
[2:04:56] you amen so that's why we trust all
[2:04:59] things work together for
[2:05:01] good and many things we might not know
[2:05:04] why we're here on
[2:05:07] Earth God don't need to tell us
[2:05:10] everything he he will tell us what we
[2:05:14] need but there's many
[2:05:16] things that we will see when we are on
[2:05:18] the other
[2:05:20] side God don't need to tell you
[2:05:22] everything
[2:05:24] here God is trusting you
[2:05:27] anyhow God is trusting you amen and if
[2:05:31] God is trusting you he don't need to
[2:05:34] tell you
[2:05:35] everything because he knows you will
[2:05:37] make
[2:05:38] it because you are a part of
[2:05:41] him amen so God bless you all this
[2:05:44] morning and uh I I'm just feel like I
[2:05:47] want to say thank you very much for
[2:05:49] having me here again
[2:05:53] can just share a little bit what the
[2:05:55] Lord put on our
[2:05:58] hearts amen amen the Lord is good isn't
[2:06:01] he and his mercy endureth
[2:06:06] forever hallelujah amen are you happy in
[2:06:09] the Lord this
[2:06:11] morning amen amen let us stand
[2:06:15] together as we go into the
[2:06:18] scripture and uh I just want to speak
[2:06:22] this
[2:06:23] morning something in my
[2:06:27] heart and uh I want to speak of the our
[2:06:34] journey towards all
[2:06:37] [Music]
[2:06:40] things we know the Bible said all things
[2:06:44] are
[2:06:46] possible do you believe that all things
[2:06:51] are
[2:06:52] possible can we say that
[2:06:55] together all
[2:06:58] things say it to
[2:07:01] yourself all
[2:07:03] things are
[2:07:05] possible to them that
[2:07:08] believe amen and we want to see this
[2:07:12] morning our
[2:07:14] journey to all
[2:07:17] things because there's a journey towards
[2:07:19] all things
[2:07:25] amen there is a journey to
[2:07:28] go to come to All
[2:07:31] Things amen you're with
[2:07:34] me we believe all things are
[2:07:37] possible but there's a journey to
[2:07:41] go that we reach that
[2:07:44] goal of all
[2:07:47] things amen let's turn to Genesis uh and
[2:07:51] we want to have Abraham in this uh this
[2:07:55] morning maybe also this afternoon we
[2:07:57] will see how the Lord
[2:08:01] leads uh Abraham uh you know actually
[2:08:05] because you know why
[2:08:07] Abraham you know Abraham has a has a
[2:08:11] special meaning to the
[2:08:15] believer he's a special Tye of the
[2:08:18] Bible because with him God started a
[2:08:21] different
[2:08:24] work amen with him God started a
[2:08:27] different
[2:08:28] work that's why the generation of Jesus
[2:08:32] Christ in Matthew 1 does not start with
[2:08:37] Adam but it starts with
[2:08:40] Abraham you read Matthew 1 the
[2:08:44] generation of Jesus
[2:08:46] Christ starts with Abraham
[2:08:51] amen amen amen that's why Abraham has
[2:08:56] such a great impact on
[2:09:02] us and Abraham's life is such an
[2:09:07] example for our
[2:09:09] life can we say Amen to
[2:09:12] that Genesis 15 we want to read from
[2:09:16] verse one
[2:09:22] after these
[2:09:25] things the word of the Lord came to
[2:09:28] Abraham in a vision saying fear not
[2:09:31] Abraham I am thy shield and thy
[2:09:34] exceeding great
[2:09:46] reward and Abraham said Lord God what
[2:09:49] will thou give me seeing I go childless
[2:09:52] and the steward of my house is elasa of
[2:10:05] Damascus and Abraham said behold me thou
[2:10:08] uh to me thou has given no seed and lo
[2:10:12] one born in my house is mine heir
[2:10:24] amen and behold the word of the Lord
[2:10:25] came unto him saying this shall not be
[2:10:28] thine Heir but he that shall come forth
[2:10:31] out of thine own bowels shall be thine
[2:10:44] air and he brought him forth abroad and
[2:10:47] said look now towards heaven and tell
[2:10:49] the Stars if th be able bble to number
[2:10:52] them and he said unto him so shall thy
[2:10:55] seed
[2:11:06] be hallelujah hallelujah amen just keep
[2:11:10] in
[2:11:11] mind verse 15 chapter 15 start with
[2:11:16] after these things
[2:11:23] let's turn to Genesis
[2:11:26] 22 Genesis
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:31] 2 and again Watch how it
[2:11:36] [Music]

[2:11:41] 22 Genesis 22 ver chapter 22 verse
[2:11:46] one and it came to pass that after these
[2:11:50] things things that God did tempt Abraham
[2:11:54] and said unto him Abraham he said behold
[2:11:57] here I am
[2:12:06] I amen amen again it starts with after
[2:12:12] these
[2:12:14] things then verse 15 to

[2:16:47] was in the mind together now manifest
[2:16:56] there's a
[2:16:58] journey believe ABR had
[2:17:01] Journey you see how the journey
[2:17:04] ended we in
[2:17:08] genesis2 that great
[2:17:11] chapter of
[2:17:12] Abraham you know Abraham was finally
[2:17:17] tested it also started with after these
[2:17:22] in Genesis 15
[2:17:24] we told us that after these
[2:17:28] things came to
[2:17:31] in I tell you today it is important that
[2:17:36] comes to to
[2:17:37] us takes us into the
[2:17:40] vision the vision to Abraham came in the
[2:17:45] time of great great trials and dis
[2:17:51] you see as in Genesis
[2:17:53] 15 spoke
[2:17:55] to immediately Abraham was answering
[2:18:00] back understand after these things the
[2:18:04] Lord came to
[2:18:06] Abraham Vision you know when God gives
[2:18:10] Vision amen God gives
[2:18:13] Vision
[2:18:15] urg know
[2:18:18] necessary God was not just only talking
[2:18:21] [Applause]
[2:18:24] in
[2:18:25] Vision he in vision and and the vision
[2:18:30] is the Second
[2:18:32] Step from the
[2:18:34] Eternal from the from
[2:18:37] eternity from the
[2:18:39] supernatural God steps into a
[2:18:41] vision when finally the
[2:18:44] vision
[2:18:46] man
[2:18:48] materialized is God's way
[2:18:51] com
[2:18:52] [Applause]
[2:18:59] downal the supernatural God comes down
[2:19:03] in form of a
[2:19:04] vision when God
[2:19:07] Appears see
[2:19:10] how as
[2:19:13] Wasing as his journey
[2:19:16] stop was God just talking
[2:19:18] to God calling
[2:19:21] come out
[2:19:22] of out of out of your father's
[2:19:26] house you the place that I
[2:19:29] show the Bible did not say it was a
[2:19:32] vision so you see God speaks to us in
[2:19:35] different
[2:19:36] ways so he he Abraham in Genesis 15 he
[2:19:41] need to come to him in Vision
[2:19:44] 4 vision is the Second Step from
[2:19:49] Supernatural
[2:19:52] Vis
[2:19:56] Vis need to come down
[2:20:01] AB because Abram was in a very very uh
[2:20:05] urgent a very difficult
[2:20:09] condition as God said to
[2:20:12] him Fe not I am shield and exceeding
[2:20:15] great

[2:22:53] Bride of Jesus Christ even when it was
[2:22:55] 60 years
[2:22:57] ago spoke in of
[2:23:01] vision who can believe

[2:23:33] needed a prophetic
[2:23:43] message message is
[2:23:48] prophetic Hallelujah hallelujah amen now
[2:23:52] we
[2:23:53] [Applause]

[2:24:21] his amen so he could read in his he
[2:24:26] could call in
[2:24:29] his
[2:24:31] amen was
[2:24:34] theiling the
[2:24:37] word then
[2:24:40] Jesus he said

[2:25:00] Rec hallelujah amen but he could not be
[2:25:04] a part of the
[2:25:06] [Music]

[2:25:21] by
[2:25:22] somebody quoting
[2:25:27] scripture hallelujah hallelujah do you
[2:25:30] know how brother
[2:25:31] random he just spoke to the to the

[2:25:43] what the final test of the Bride
[2:25:47] is the prophet said the final test to

[2:26:13] test because Jesus was the
[2:26:16] words that that's why he stood the words
[2:26:18] test
[2:26:21] and you you catch that Satan only can
[2:26:25] quote
[2:26:27] scripture but Satan is not a part of the
[2:26:32] vision that's why he can just go what
[2:26:34] it's
[2:26:36] written but Jesus could go beyond what
[2:26:40] was
[2:26:42] written he could go and find out why it
[2:26:48] was written

[2:27:50] H you can follow
[2:27:52] me amen you
[2:27:55] understand how Abraham was brought to a
[2:27:59] test and it was God tempting
[2:28:04] him the Bible tells us the Lord tempted
[2:28:11] Abraham why was he temp tempting
[2:28:14] him just to prove
[2:28:16] him who he
[2:28:18] was God God likes to
[2:28:21] show who you
[2:28:24] are God wants to
[2:28:27] show to your

[2:28:50] by testing

[2:29:06] strange don't feel
[2:29:08] strange if you fall into fiery
[2:29:13] trials is it right Peter saying don't
[2:29:16] feel

[2:41:42] what is happening in the
[2:41:44] negative God is doing in the positive
[2:41:52] was it not the
[2:41:53] enemy in the time of
[2:41:56] Gideon
[2:41:58] confessing
[2:42:00] proclaiming his
[2:42:02] position when Gideon was afraid
[2:42:06] himself the Lord told him go into the
[2:42:10] camp of the
[2:42:11] enemy when he went into the camp of the
[2:42:14] enemy there was someone that had a dream
[2:42:16] in the camp of the enemy
[2:42:21] the
[2:42:21] enemy
[2:42:23] confessed the enemy had to
[2:42:26] witness who Gideon was and when Gideon
[2:42:31] heard the enemy speaking of his
[2:42:35] position he gets
[2:42:41] strengthened and if you cannot believe
[2:42:43] who you
[2:42:44] are then believe the
[2:42:46] enemy telling you who you are
[2:42:51] [Music]
[2:42:55] hallelujah
[2:42:56] hallelujah I can
[2:42:58] imagine I I know I can remember it was
[2:43:01] the year
[2:43:04] 2017 I think I preached about it here
[2:43:07] there was a was a great celebration
[2:43:10] going on in the
[2:43:13] churches the Catholic Church made a
[2:43:16] great celebration
[2:43:20] 2017 a great a great Crusade a great
[2:43:25] campaign amen and they did it and at
[2:43:29] that great
[2:43:30] campaign one of the one of the one of
[2:43:33] the young young
[2:43:35] Bishops but a very influ very
[2:43:38] influential
[2:43:42] one they called it Harvest Time
[2:43:49] they called it Harvest
[2:43:54] Time amen amen they called
[2:43:59] it it's harvest time you know what that
[2:44:02] man said
[2:44:05] 2017 he was in direct connection with
[2:44:08] the
[2:44:09] Pope you know what he said we are
[2:44:15] united protest is over
[2:44:21] he was saying protest is
[2:44:22] over there's not not such a thing as a
[2:44:25] Protestant church
[2:44:31] anymore amen the Protestant church is a
[2:44:35] church that came forth with Martin
[2:44:41] Luther who protested against the
[2:44:44] Catholic
[2:44:46] church that man says
[2:44:49] protest is
[2:44:52] over that man said we are all
[2:45:00] one he said
[2:45:02] that amen am short after it he died in
[2:45:07] an
[2:45:11] accident he
[2:45:13] said we are
[2:45:15] united now listen what brother bham said
[2:45:19] between The
[2:45:21] Binding of the wrong churches of the
[2:45:25] wheat between The Binding of the
[2:45:28] wheat and the
[2:45:32] man
[2:45:38] whe we we could I don't know if I
[2:45:40] quickly have the church AG booked for
[2:45:45] it let me quickly see if I have the
[2:45:47] church asbook then you can see what
[2:45:49] brother Bon
[2:45:56] said other I would just quote
[2:46:07] it brother Bram said between The Binding
[2:46:11] of the
[2:46:16] tears and the full manifestation of the
[2:46:22] Antichrist he said the Rapture will take
[2:46:29] place so now the enemy is telling
[2:46:33] us how far we
[2:46:39] are can we say praise the
[2:46:43] Lord if you cannot believe
[2:46:46] it as the minister is preaching
[2:46:50] it because it sounds too
[2:46:53] um yeah too
[2:46:58] fanatic Gideon couldn't believe
[2:47:02] it even the Lord told him different even
[2:47:06] the even the Lord told him the Lord told
[2:47:09] him the the
[2:47:11] Lord Gideon could not believe
[2:47:15] it even God told him
[2:47:19] what did God told him thou Mighty Man
[2:47:24] of but he couldn't believe that he asked
[2:47:28] for signs he asked for
[2:47:30] wonders but he couldn't believe it even
[2:47:34] the Lord told him who he was but he
[2:47:38] couldn't believe
[2:47:41] it how many times the minister in this
[2:47:45] Pulpit is trying to tell you who you
[2:47:52] [Music]
[2:47:54] are Watch The Life of
[2:47:57] Gideon amen finally God used the
[2:48:03] enemy to convince
[2:48:07] him because when Gideon you you
[2:48:10] understand Church how we
[2:48:12] awake we see the Bible
[2:48:15] stories speaking of our condition time
[2:48:19] that we are living in after Joshua after
[2:48:22] the Holy Spirit has left the
[2:48:25] church that was a time when Gideon
[2:48:30] was hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:48:33] hallelujah all

[2:50:23] [Music]
[2:50:25] him let us stay there for a
[2:50:28] moment because I just feel that is a
[2:50:31] point where we are many times
[2:50:35] at God told him thou are Mighty Man of
[2:50:41] valure this is who you
[2:50:43] are and then said If God be with us if
[2:50:48] God is with us where is all those
[2:50:57] Miracles yes if that is
[2:51:00] so I am a mighty man of
[2:51:04] well why do I hide wheat in the wine
[2:51:09] press why do I hide wheat in the wine
[2:51:13] press
[2:51:18] you all go and read the Book of Judges
[2:51:21] the story of
[2:51:22] Gideon you understand when God talked to
[2:51:26] him he was just
[2:51:29] threshing wheat in the wine
[2:51:34] press somebody have read the
[2:51:37] story if you not go ahead and read
[2:51:40] it because it
[2:51:42] shows typically what the believer is
[2:51:46] today hallelujah hallelujah amen and
[2:51:48] then God came to him God spoke to him as
[2:51:52] he was threshing wheat in the wine
[2:51:58] press God came to him and told him thou
[2:52:02] Mighty Man of well now God in your
[2:52:05] condition that you
[2:52:08] are God comes down
[2:52:10] himself did God came down in this
[2:52:14] hour did God came down himself in this
[2:52:17] hour
[2:52:18] [Applause]
[2:52:21] hallelujah hallelujah first he sent the
[2:52:24] prophets as it was with
[2:52:26] Gideon you read your Bible Gideon had
[2:52:30] received the
[2:52:32] prophet and brother ROM says as Gideon
[2:52:35] was just reading a message book under a
[2:52:39] tree the Lord himself came
[2:52:42] [Applause]
[2:52:44] down hallelujah hallelujah amen so if
[2:52:49] you are busy with the message of the
[2:52:53] hour is a good
[2:52:55] chance that God comes straight to
[2:53:01] you hallelujah hallelujah amen and you
[2:53:05] understand then the Lord made himself
[2:53:08] known to
[2:53:09] Gideon finally Gideon
[2:53:12] understood this is the Lord
[2:53:16] himself talking to me now
[2:53:19] do you understand that this message is
[2:53:23] the Lord
[2:53:25] himself talking to you
[2:53:29] now can you
[2:53:31] believe what he said about
[2:53:34] [Applause]

[2:54:09] Testament amen and you know who does it
[2:54:13] they call themselves The

[2:55:26] that was
[2:55:28] there amen could call themselves the
[2:55:31] last
[2:55:32] generation the last
[2:55:34] generation amen it was
[2:55:37] after Joshua had gone the Book of Judges
[2:55:43] begins with the death of Joshua
[2:55:48] and we understand today according to
[2:55:51] what the prophet said the holy spirit in
[2:55:55] laia that's the
[2:55:57] condition are we in laia this is the
[2:56:00] last Church

[2:56:30] emotion but God is not there
[2:56:35] [Applause]
[2:56:39] anymore according to scripture this will
[2:56:42] be the
[2:56:43] condition of the
[2:56:46] church is it
[2:56:48] right amen Christ has left the
[2:56:53] church they have rejected the message of

[3:00:47] difference
[3:00:51] we are not brothers because we have the

[3:01:24] Africa culture plays a big role in
[3:01:30] Germany there's a strong spirit in
[3:01:35] Germany called the national German
[3:01:40] spirit and you have that in
[3:01:42] Africa you have strong
[3:01:46] spirits nationalistic
[3:01:56] you can see this this man comes from
[3:01:58] that area that man comes from that
[3:02:04] area amen am and that's our
[3:02:08] outside but that shouldn't rule the
[3:02:13] church because we are all baptized into
[3:02:16] one body
[3:02:19] and our national
[3:02:22] Spirits our home
[3:02:24] Spirits our
[3:02:26] spirits that we are living

[3:02:39] himself hallelujah hallelujah amen
[3:02:43] amen amen you see let's shortly stay
[3:02:47] with Gideon
[3:02:49] because it is this is so much a type of
[3:02:53] what the believer is
[3:02:56] today and as I said if you cannot
[3:02:59] believe God speaking to
[3:03:02] you gon wanted to believe
[3:03:06] him but the circumstances in
[3:03:09] life he said if God is with
[3:03:15] us why is all these problems
[3:03:18] [Music]
[3:03:21] that's a question you
[3:03:25] had amen am and he was
[3:03:33] right you know when he asked God where
[3:03:37] is all those
[3:03:40] Miracles that our father spoke
[3:03:42] of you know what God give him as an
[3:03:46] answer he said you go in your
[3:03:51] might that was God's
[3:03:54] answer go in your
[3:03:57] might
[3:03:59] go know who you are because you are the
[3:04:05] continuation of what your father's
[3:04:09] had and this is what God has telling her
[3:04:12] this
[3:04:13] morning do you believe this church today
[3:04:17] is it's a continuation of the book of
[3:04:21] Acts do you believe that do you believe
[3:04:25] that that Jesus Christ is the same today
[3:04:29] as he was 50 years
[3:04:31] ago do you believe he's the
[3:04:37] same hallelujah hallelujah amen amen but
[3:04:41] you
[3:04:44] see Gideon G he was still afraid
[3:04:50] and then suddenly you had a you know big
[3:04:54] following the church grew bigger they
[3:04:57] had 30,000
[3:04:59] people and you know it's always becomes
[3:05:03] a
[3:05:04] mistake when we start counting how many
[3:05:07] people are in
[3:05:13] church mhm mhm oh our church is bigger
[3:05:18] than the brother's
[3:05:20] [Music]

[3:05:25] displeased with
[3:05:29] David when he was numbering the
[3:05:35] people you know
[3:05:40] why I trust you can get
[3:05:44] that as
[3:05:46] David was numbering the
[3:05:49] people one of his generals told
[3:05:52] him don't do
[3:05:55] that God don't like it if we are going
[3:05:58] by
[3:05:59] numbers and feel because we are so
[3:06:03] many that's why we are we we are we are
[3:06:05] we are

[3:07:40] Uganda not because of numbers
[3:07:47] hallelujah hallelujah but I know a

[3:07:52] on because the people come to know who
[3:07:56] they
[3:08:00] are the bright
[3:08:04] Revival cannot be counted in
[3:08:08] numbers it's never the

[3:11:24] stand remember brother brandom one day
[3:11:29] he was looking at a at a
[3:11:39] sign and the sign
[3:11:43] was it does not
[3:11:45] matter it does not matter how big the
[3:11:50] dog is in a
[3:11:54] fight it
[3:11:56] matters how big the fight is in the
[3:12:12] dog is it
[3:12:14] right sometimes you have these big
[3:12:18] dogs and they hardly can move because
[3:12:21] they are too
[3:12:26] fed you don't have to be scared of
[3:12:29] them but then you have these little
[3:12:36] dogs oh I saw little
[3:12:39] dogs fighting against big
[3:12:42] dog so doesn't matter how big the dog is
[3:12:47] what matters is how big the fight is in
[3:12:49] the
[3:12:51] door it doesn't matter how big the
[3:12:53] church
[3:12:55] is what is matters what kind of spirit
[3:12:59] is in the
[3:13:03] church hallelujah hallelujah what
[3:13:05] quality of spirit is in the
[3:13:09] church hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my
[3:13:15] Hallelujah you remember
[3:13:17] it was told to
[3:13:19] Moses in behalf of the
[3:13:24] Tabernacle it was told to him you know
[3:13:27] they had Lambs in the
[3:13:29] temple Lambs
[3:13:35] lambs is that right and God told him to
[3:13:39] have the Lambs burning constantly
[3:13:47] you need
[3:13:49] oil and
[3:13:52] important pure
[3:13:55] [Music]
[3:14:00] oil so it's not so important how much
[3:14:04] oil you
[3:14:07] have it's important what kind of quality
[3:14:10] you
[3:14:15] have Hallelujah
[3:14:18] and you can see sometimes you can be in
[3:14:21] a in a church and there quality of the
[3:14:26] spirit is very
[3:14:31] high hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[3:14:33] hallelujah and sometimes you find lot of
[3:14:36] human Spirit mixed
[3:14:41] within amen and when human spirit is
[3:14:45] mixed Within
[3:14:47] the oil is not pure
[3:14:50] again and the
[3:14:53] L and the Lord told Moses when you use
[3:14:57] oil to make the lamb burn
[3:15:02] constantly you have to have pure
[3:15:05] oil
[3:15:07] Hallelujah and this
[3:15:09] message is pure
[3:15:14] oil Hallelujah this message is the
[3:15:18] entire Holy
[3:15:20] [Applause]
[3:15:22] Ghost no human Spirit mixed
[3:15:25] [Applause]
[3:15:29] within hallelujah hallelujah amen so I
[3:15:33] care about the fight in the
[3:15:36] dark I don't care about the big dark in
[3:15:38] the
[3:15:40] fight when I want to see the quality you
[3:15:45] have then you have
[3:15:47] enough to win every
[3:15:51] [Applause]
[3:15:55] battle hallelujah hallelujah oh as I'm
[3:15:58] I'm going amen just finish that with
[3:16:01] Gideon because I think it's
[3:16:04] important because it's again the enemy
[3:16:07] church is the
[3:16:09] enemy now finally they had
[3:16:15] 30,000 Gideon had with him
[3:16:18] 30,000 so if you're 30,000 with
[3:16:21] you you feel
[3:16:24] strong you know what God
[3:16:26] said there's too
[3:16:32] many you know what Gideon said no
[3:16:36] there's not too many God said yes
[3:16:38] there's too
[3:16:40] many let
[3:16:42] them that are
[3:16:44] afraid go home
[3:16:47] so Gideon had to ask are you
[3:16:51] afraid who's afraid that goes
[3:16:53] home how many people
[3:16:57] went I believe 20,000
[3:17:01] went I think 10,000
[3:17:04] left and God said still too
[3:17:09] many gion said
[3:17:12] no God said
[3:17:14] yes too many opinions
[3:17:22] said many times when a church grows in
[3:17:28] numbers they come away from the real
[3:17:38] thing so don't look for
[3:17:42] numbers don't hide behind numbers
[3:17:48] don't hide behind
[3:17:50] numbers because God has chosen
[3:17:59] you so it comes back and back again it
[3:18:02] comes back and back again you know what
[3:18:04] the problem was when David was numbering
[3:18:06] the people
[3:18:16] soon as he has numbered the
[3:18:20] people God said because you have done
[3:18:26] this God was
[3:18:30] angry why was God
[3:18:35] angry not
[3:18:38] only because David didn't trust in God
[3:18:45] anymore yeah it's
[3:18:47] true he numbered the people because he
[3:18:51] didn't trust
[3:18:55] God if you trust God you don't need
[3:19:05] numbers amen amen but not only because
[3:19:09] of
[3:19:09] that God was angry with
[3:19:12] him because David had no trust in
[3:19:16] himself
[3:19:28] mm come on who killed the
[3:19:35] lion who killed the
[3:19:40] bear who killed Goliath
[3:19:52] uh-huh
[3:19:53] uh-huh and David now you are counting
[3:20:04] people let that
[3:20:09] sink he had already received the
[3:20:13] prophet where the message telling him
[3:20:16] who he
[3:20:18] is was he
[3:20:21] anointed was he
[3:20:24] anointed who anointed
[3:20:27] him the prophet who anointed us the
[3:20:35] prophet only
[3:20:38] Kings get anointed
[3:20:48] I want to repeat
[3:20:50] that when David was
[3:20:52] there he was about to anoint the first
[3:20:57] born yeah he was anointed the he was
[3:21:00] about to anoint the first
[3:21:07] born he was a big
[3:21:08] [Applause]
[3:21:11] guy and while he was going God said
[3:21:15] no don't
[3:21:17] him he's not the
[3:21:19] [Music]
[3:21:22] king only
[3:21:26] Kings get
[3:21:31] anointed is the message anointing

[3:45:27] Bible from Babylon to
[3:45:30] Christ 14
[3:45:34] Generations if you count carefully in
[3:45:37] the
[3:45:38] Bible there's only 13 Generations
[3:45:41] written

[3:47:08] beginning and the end God never has a

[4:03:31] day amen uh the minister spoken to
[4:03:36] us it begins from the
[4:03:40] Supernatural and when it comes to the
[4:03:42] vision

[4:03:47] sure that we are the
[4:03:51] materialization amen of what the prophet

[4:04:19] vision is from him that is the word and
[4:04:24] about him that is the word so Christ
[4:04:28] being the word from whom the visions of
[4:04:31] the word
[4:04:33] comes could not be fooled by the
[4:04:37] devil who was trying to quote
[4:04:41] scriptures because Christ himself
[4:04:44] was the life behind every
[4:04:48] scripture and as he to he did not see
[4:04:51] himself his
[4:04:54] life backing up those
[4:04:57] scriptures that the devil was coming up
[4:05:00] with are you together with me but we

[4:05:34] test is to prove who you
[4:05:37] are Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[4:05:40] today forever
[4:05:44] does not mean a God who repeats
[4:05:47] himself but a God who has got constant
[4:05:52] unfolding
[4:05:55] abilities and it tells us that
[4:05:59] eternally this God will keep unfolding
[4:06:04] himself amen he says once the te are
[4:06:10] bound the rupture can take place
[4:06:13] is that amen and out there the has
[4:06:18] already
[4:06:19] bound so any time the rupture can take
[4:06:23] place and that's so at some
