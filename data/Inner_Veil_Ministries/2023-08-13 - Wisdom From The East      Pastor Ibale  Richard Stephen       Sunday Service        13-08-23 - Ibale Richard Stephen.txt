his place to appreciate him amen amen so he's one of our new pastors not very dedicated is working in two different localities amen so he writes his motorcycle amen amen preachers then he goes and preaches again in his original Church yeah foreign as we come to church always we just come with an open heart Omega and when the message is coming forth God speaks to every one of us in a different way amen amen he may say to you in a different way and then it speaks to another from the same message a different way so as we teach the message I'm sure that the Lord knows how to distribute it among the peace amen and you remember faith comes by hearing people and hearing by the word of God Amen and when I say by the word of God I'm not saying from the word by the word of God because all of us come from the spoken word church is a very interesting thing the word the Holy Spirit even if you are coming for the first time amen Amina so brother Elijah God bless you I was just checking on this temperature yesterday I think he's doing well I mean so let's stand up up and get into the scripture reading you remember when Jesus was before in Bethlehem of Jordan basically came into Jesus Christ are you together with me so we are really talking about those men this morning amen Matthew chapter 2 verse now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judah yes in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem from the East to Jerusalem May the Lord that blessing the reading of Israel the scripture says There came wise men from the East so we are taking foreign from the East a magazine wisdom a magazine from the East that's going to be our title this morning so we need to look at the significance of two things in this scripture wisdom a magazine under the East Andover wisdom a magazine and the East so symbolically the East is associated with falling from the presence of the Lord amen so Genesis chapter four and verse 16. the scripture says and Cain went from the presence of the Lord and drought in the land of Lord on the East of Eden Eden that's the East away from the presence of the Lord now Genesis 13 11. then Lord chose him on the plane of Jordan and Lord Janet East and they separated themselves [Music] the one from the other is separated with Abraham and the scripture says he went you may call it a way of life that lives away from the presence of God and as brother Branham teaches he tells us that civilization began from the East so after Cain moves the Bible says that he started to build modern civilizations amen amen so Genesis 4 17. he built the first city and Genesis 4 21. he was I mean his line started music for entertainment not for worship now but music for entertainment and in Genesis in Genesis chapter four we find that the morals completely were corrupted polygamous because in the lineage of King Genesis chapter 4 verse hear my voice [Music] [Music] [Music] in amen [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] not that and then you get home and you study how Israel settled around the Tabernacles amen I think we need our lives to settle around the presence amen that whatsoever you did you are mining the presence of God because by faith Israel news they knew they were staying around the presence amen let's go to Genesis chapter numbers [Applause] [Music] shall preach by his standard [Music] foreignty he recognizes he recognize the sovereignty of Judah you have to get away the sovereignty of zebulance the sovereignty of them he respected them according to their own tries and they also had an answer [Applause] you know the tribes of his because this message is related to the sovereignty of that local child and the condition and the level of maturity amen praise the Lord you hear some of the young churches when you go out there you may start saying these Believers the love of God is working with because this is the love of maturity are you together with me so God works uniquely recognizes the existence of the local churches and then he partners with them along that level and then he understands their battles and deals with them to help them win their battles so there are so many local churches [Applause] that has come down in our days uh [Applause] [Applause] their lives was weaved around [Applause] say no just [Applause] by the door exactly God allowed the two special men that was Moses they gathered that door are you together with me yes sir why would God put Moses that's what we are going to find out amen wisdom from the ears he says but those that encamp before the Tabernacle whenever towards the east even before the Tabernacle of the congregation is keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel complete read it and the stranger that comes nice if it was in the New Testament they were ministering the entrance to the people that were under the blood are you together with me anybody that's not under the blood in the New Testament is looked at as a stranger that had no right to enter if it was in the days of Moses are you together with me foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] he says [Music] [Music] [Applause] is the boldness foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign all right are you together with me what is it so let us go into the New Testament a bit Ephesians wear foreign [Music] [Applause] were represented by unclean Foods [Applause] who was uh you know devout yeah his name was called Cornelius you know he was a gentile and he prayed yes he prayed yes he wanted to see God in his life and then the angel came down came down he told him your prayers are high yeah into Japan there is a man called Simon he's upstairs [Applause] he got men and they went to the house of sauce and they were looking for Peter foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] because of the blood amen now verse 13. now in Christ Jesus yes you sometimes we have been accepted in the Commonwealth foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] who cannot come in foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] everyone [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] God gives the messenger the message and now what's the messenger does every minister in that age and remember when uh you know the man that was coming from Jerusalem and he had fallen Amen in the Jericho Praise the Lord when he was brought back he was given to the pastor um sometimes we like a lot of Independence and we develop problems you don't just come pray the reading and join the society God gives you to The Innkeeper and any keepers given the two pairs to nurse the injured man welcome back and that's what we are doing this morning to allow you in okay to take you into presence [Applause] amenities [Applause] so this man touched the wisdom of Revelation that's very important amen and we'll walk through the open door of Moses [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] when Adam and Eve sin Adam they walked out but the Garden of Eden music that's where every person [Applause] he's born in the East with a fallen nature [Applause] [Applause] you need the wisdom of Revelation he says that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ to the front of Glory give unto you and again the spirit of wisdom and Revelation amen amen wisdom magazine of Revelation catch that door Hallelujah and the moment you catch that door that means You've Got Confidence immediately [Applause] let's go to Matthew 16 18. thank you you know he says Thou Art the Christ thank you the son of the Living God then Jesus answered him and I say unto thee yeah and Upon This Rock and build my church and the gifts of Hell shall not Prevail against it [Music] [Applause] had never heard of that name Peter yeah he was called Simon [Applause] son of Jonah um but when it got that Revelations is this man confused he doesn't know me a word she he kept him a new name and he helped him cuts that door okay and Upon This Rock I'll build my church Upon This Rock Quran upon the rock rushing of the wisdom of Revelations foreign [Applause] all of us have got a new name and we all have to grow into that name did you hear what I say we have to Grant a particular character amen so he gave him the keys that's the wisdom of Revelations [Applause] [Music] are you together with him what is it yes sir when I'm talking of the doors [Applause] and they're looking at the door to the house [Applause] but Jesus are you together with me so the spirit of wisdom in Revelation of him [Applause] the revelation of Christ becoming the foundation of our faith who focuses [Applause] wisdom is following the Stars amen [Applause] [Applause] because they kept falling to the east falling to the east but they realize there is something that is lacking and yet they are a part of the gene of God Amen then they begin to see the stars taking them towards where he's born hallelujah praise God so the wise men they will not want to stay in a life of sins we are here but the East is the nature of sin that is you don't want to live there foreign but you need to realize you are living in the city and you want to be restored back to God and so this was men here it is [Music] [Music] with such a releasing baldness I don't want to remain in this condition you know foreign [Music] [Music] The Whispers of evil movie Satan is Eden is the best look at that you charge your mind you remember you leave the house how can you live a life without weed about yeah The Whispers Obama dot accept foreign [Music] he was saying how can I live this life he was a circled by prostitution drugs nightlife don't go witchcraft the condition was so bad but deep down inside there he knew he had the father you see once you are a child of God even if you fall well the reality to that there is a loving father does not depart from a man's heart yeah the Bible says he kept in the struggles and the Bible says one day he came to himself away from the father's guidance and Leadership but the Bible says he came to himself so wisdom is turning around wisdom magazine is taking the step of justification I'm going to my father he will justify the morning I'm walking this way after a while something speaks to me that's not where the Bible says and he came to himself brother Branham says and something speaks to me and nothing can tell me about God I'm turn this away when I turn around that's my justification the pictures my object of going is the picture so you know he turns around instead of going further east he stops at a certain point and he says I have a loving father and then he begins to work and the object finally is the loving father um oh Lord he turns around praise God now his objections is just Christ and where was Christ where was the anointing um it was way out here in the holy of holies when they put a bright Road of iron it's better than fruited we go when they put the money instead fresh all the time when everyone entered there alone there was a bright shining lights that is our objects to get into holy presence so that we can return [Applause] amen Amina so wisdom was repentance wisdom foreign so Luke 15 16. we are talking about this man in Australia and the old friend of filled his body with the husks you ever surrendered it and no man gave it unto him yes he was so sincere we know you see when you backslide there are certain qualities that never leave are you together with him what is it there are certain qualities that never leave amen he would not steal Pig's food because he was morally better than the man of the place but yet his problem was away from the presence of hey man I mean so it doesn't matter that is hunger you may not be drinking you may not be smoking I don't know because the qualities you retained but what I'm talking about is coming back through the door so that you can enjoy Divine fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm supposed to be a Son of God I'm supposed to be perfect I'm supposed to be walking right then you come back to yourself many ways that's always positive towards holiness amen amen when he came to himself he said how many higher Servants of my fathers have prayed enough to spare and I Perce with Hunger yeah he remembered he had the loving fathers who could not treat him like Hallelujah you are not happy with yourself you don't have restful nights but once you come to yourself that's where you find the truer device [Applause] hey no more nice me as one of thy hired sons all this morning [Applause] remember that you have a lovely and walk towards the west back in a constant Fellowship amen praise God but that does not mean I am no longer [Music] that's not what it means [Applause] so he realized I'm your son but I've completely soiled my wife [Applause] he's dealing with the words he said that I've completed destroyed my wife [Applause] but then I'm still yourself [Applause] [Applause] the desire foreign [Applause] [Music] you see it's the devil strongly but always tries to nag you we don't know you know where are you going to oh come on do you remember the other day you remember you remember the other day it says I've got a loving father oh yeah do you have the loving father this afternoon that should be the joy of everybody I have I love it the mistakes will committed in life he says bring the best rope put it on him and put a ring on his hands and shoes on his feet not that I am no longer your son but I missed my wife I missed the Integrity of sonship because Sons don't go to the bar that's where I went Sons don't go to disco restaurant the joy of yourself [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] you see we are in a time where everybody knows everything but the Revelation to the desire of their hearts came with recognizing the star first yeah and we know the star is whether it is praise the Lord you see it's important coming to realize who the star is because the stars is the messenger of the age is the Moses that stands at the door of Everett [Applause] into the presence of the Lord are you together with me so where does it start foreign amen I mean it's important coming in his presence again with the true revelation of what Christ means to us and what he can do in our family we don't come to church we don't come to church to prostrate before [Applause] he says I have a loving father he was going back to our reality Hallelujah it was not looking for going to a society [Applause] and that's what we need to come to electricity we don't come to church because of the good teaching we enjoy we come to church the loving living family foreign when you are coming back whenever um you are not coming to an imagination you are not coming to a mindset area you are not coming to a belief system [Applause] you are coming to a living God that's where you need to start from an imaginary way they believe that imaginary God speaks back to them so they go on for prostrate to the images of marriage that's not what we do here there is a living God Among Us afternoon foreign they said this is a stranger this should be the star of Jacob they looked at it then they saw it then they say Where's that going where's that star going they keep following this time is our message saying that message believe it make it easy follow it it will lead you to Christ a request to born on the east side of yours amen amen they come with the gifts they didn't come with them to Hearts they came with a gift right inevitable that spoke of their revelation of him in Matthew and when they will come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and washed him and when they had opened their presence they presented that to him God and frankincense so the wise men from there is [Applause] [Applause] who was going to die to give them life so they brought gold and the God speaks of deity amen they come with Frank kisses which speaks about the service to Jehovah [Applause] and then they come with which speaks about death and that's what it was the very thing that they brought everything I don't find what they thought of him and here we are coming to church what do we come with oh [Applause] because I've got my grandkids I have my grandchildren some of them say oh we are going to see to church to see Tata I am going to church now you don't know what it is we are going to church we just see uh Mama hope or something like that but what do you come to church foreign [Music] these men when they came they were carrying something that identified they are burning desires that yes indeed we are going to meet Jehovah yes we are going in the service yes we are going to die to our sins they were coming with something specific but when we present ourselves the wisdom of revelation we have of him foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] that's the wisdom from this that's the revelation we have of him wisdom by that Friday in the first coming and now wisdom Fighters where is he born King of the Jews into the coming of Christ praise the Lord those men looked at the stars and it took them years they were following that stuffs they were under the light of the Stars yeah are we going to remain under the light of the Stars take those messages stay under the light of that stuff it will guide you to the second coming of Christ my Ministry that is but how can we know him unless we are in the world amen amen so the first major gift because you know I want you to it was God and then frankincense service to Jehovah and then the last one was saying that he's going to die for us amen Amina so we need to look at the new testament's church I want you to follow me very well first permanent giftable is in the beginning of the church was the gift of one Apostle Charlie and everybody wanted to be an apostle until the scripture says you checked them that said that they were Apostles it was a great gift they wanted to be like a poem James amen amen and after that the next gift was the Teaching Ministry it became so powerful Amen in second Peter chapter 2 verse 1. there were false prophets also among the people who privilege shall bringing dominant [Applause] the apostolic message to me foreign haha everybody then wanted to be an evangelist a revengers the great missionary that went to India in 1773 Livingston to South Africa although some of those great men I got names or plenty of them here the white man the brown man all wars broken down and this man went out into Mission fields evangelists to me so many of them in the beginning of the church and then after that comes the teachers and then finally come on so the last two major gifts is hahaha standing at the EastEnders to bring the people back into the presence are you together with me Ronnie let us look at this you know after the age of the open door then we just stepped into the edge of the restoration the age of the Elijah Ministry um and you know like Malachi 45 says behold I will send you Elijah the prophets before the coming of the great and red food of the Lords of the fathers to the children and hearts of the children to their fathers I come to Smite the Earth with the curse so at the time of this gift everybody wanted to be a restaurant foreign [Applause] when brother Branham and he had that anointing then everybody anointed everybody I also have a mentor then I know listen what is it praise the Lord he promised that yes of his auntie so that says the Bible just exactly this day that wasn't a lady that was that was the spirit of Elijah Elijah was just a man now we have heard Elijah this is everything but the light of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ after [Applause] so once you lose that anointing I mean you lose that understanding well if we went again then you are going to kill him to a man to but it's an anointing after that came by Elijah that is that goes to the Jews will be the Lord Jesus Christ the ministry of the son of man so Saint Luke 17 says the son of man is to revealing himself among his people it will come through a prophet are you hearing me he never had two major professor at the same time amen it has to be one hand allowed us to get one man under his control there's one God there's one father and Holy Ghost but one God so has he with Elijah the spirit of Elijah he used that Spirit but the same God controlling the time he said to fulfill his wife when that anointing came down everybody they measure for you so the last Ministry that will stand with this alleged anointing is the Minister of the past to keep the door open for the people amen amen so the last Ministry now is like a twice when Moses built the Tabernacles and put Amos I mean Aaron and himself [Applause] that were not coming by my future but the prophet of the entire the anointing of Christ himself [Applause] to the revelation of Christ again amen Amina yes sir that's what I'm here for wow not to become some big fellow man to help you back into that Divine Fellowship amen Amina so all the rest of the body must not start there is a special Grace upon the ministry of the pastor today and now when you look around we're together everybody who starts he also wants to be a pastor that's the anointing when the anointing fell upon the apostles went fell upon the teachings everybody when it came down evangelists but the last four I mean the last Ministry anointed by you amen amen which is going to be murdered in the church is the anointing of the past standing together with the message the revelation of Christ when brother Branham says don't never leave your church stay with your pastor he means to stay with the feeding gifts not with everybody who claims the anointing but stay with the feeding gifts because the minister of the past to feed the people on the revelation of Christ we must have something from Malachi to feed the flock back and then a minister that holds the people all of them holds the people under them without a Feeling decorated you keep the people you've got authority over them but you don't feed them listen to what brother Branham says and I want this church when I leave into the ministry here to go out into the fields I want you to stay with your past understanding that teaching that has been taught here no now is not only saying the pastor but the food to stay with the kind of food stay with this word you stay with you stay right with the world no matter what comes oh God and then it comes down into the Ephesian churches what have Disney collisions the word comes from two Greek words which means which means somebody was doing something in that early church which was Conquering the people if the people were being conquered when it had been some Authority amen amen so what was it that God hated that was happening in the church what was going on there and it's now going on today is exactly what is the word inequality means that was absolutely contrary to the world but what we are here is to feed on that word believe that message take it as you're staying amen I mean and so Lord I Thank you for the message if he's correcting you thank God thank God for that because the purpose at the end of it is to bring you to the Christ born in our time amen amen wisdom will bring people back from the east of sin to the presence of the anointed person of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Amina so let us identify wisdom here amen we've seen the east whenever we've already identified the Easter symbolic of whereas in Texas foreign because we are coming back through the world it is saying something to you is giving you a robe of the world producing watts of righteousness your work is getting different you experience the authority of a God over you amen so by looking at the three wise men because traditional religious history they started looking for him where he was not they went to the curse of religious men where is he born King of the Jews stayed away but when they sold the stay again the grace of God you could have strayed a little bit in your mind and you put away your mind God is trying to call you back yeah [Music] because the sun let the Stars which is the message the message that knows where that door is leading Us by the light of the world Amen and that's wisdom when we seek leadership from the Star Messenger of our age [Applause] amen praise the Lord wisdom foreign it begins from seeing something the authority of the star or winds we have seen a story It's Beginning from Revelation that God has sent us this time they said we have seen his stuff and we have come to worship we have come to build on some Revelations [Applause] of something that we are convinced of according to questions [Applause] is defining what our determination is [Applause] praise God what do you come in church just to be part of a gallery just be part of the religion you need to become a wife Ukraine amen Amina the wise men brought with them particular gifts that Spock of their Revelations we have been following up the Tabernacles there was the Tabernacle of Moses until we come to the Tabernacle in Revelation 21. amen which is listen here listen magazine [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] our Lord oh [Applause] so I want to call you wisdom from the East you realized your fault and you say I have a loving father abandoned that you are wisdom from the East you know wait how to found your Tabernacle is Seven Pillars praise God Upon This Rock I build my church it's Revelation that builds the church wisdom magaz is permitting God no ganachunder to guide your path amen Amina so the bride is led by revelations has laid down by the messenger in Everest to build ourselves amen I mean So speaking about the construction of his Temple Solomon he fast to himself as whiskey magazine praise God he says that wisdom has builded his 10.7 pillars he had built this Temple all the specifications given by the father then the glory of God comes down in the temple and the priests are one of these days there will be a time when all these Ministries are going to be overrun by the glory of the Lord are you together with it when is it what are we going to need the ministry for in the millennium there will be no sick to prefer there'll be no Revelation to preach we shall be in the reality you need Revelation if you don't use the ministry you've lost it there is coming a time where the glory of the Lord shall completely shut down the ministry currency [Music] when Moses finished the glory of God came down when David finished his Temple the glory of God came down when Solomon finishes the glory of God amen amen but then the scripture says [Applause] he says it's going to be greater Hallelujah there was nothing now let me take you after Solomon builds his house in First Kings chapter 8. amen Amina he said there was nothing in the earth which was the sport that horrible in the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egyptian are you together with me what is it look at the word that's been put in the Tabernacles it was not added with anything it was pure child he says there was nothing in the ACT except for the two tablets but in our Ark I am you find this Pentecostal things and it stops the glory of God but there was nothing right except for the two tablets of laws and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the Holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord praise the Lord when the priests were come out of the Holy place that loud filled the house could not stand to minister for the glory of the Lord what do you mean inside the presence of the glory what are you going to do he has come down he has filled the house this is the only opportunity to minister to you the gospel of life time is going to come where there will be no Apostles no prophets no teachers the glory of the Lord will just filled the house and we are getting into that time friends when we are coming into the time of being caught away we shall step into the time of Look Away to Jesus we shall stop in the time of the squeeze time is coming when these churches will close and those who have not faded with the two tablets of law anybody is we need to feed now that's wisdom is feeding on the world for the time we look up when this word will not be that freedom so there was a seventh seal the dedication of the Templeton to take over from the ministry God comes down foreign who just came into our pastors uh services on Thursday he has never been part of it but he was you know in a Pentecostal world and out there his friends were telling him let's look for people want Power so I don't know what that power will anointed when it comes on thy site we are feeding to The Courier because the anointing is going to fall this is we are built ourselves and the anointing is coming down are you together with me what is it so the first coming they found Christ in the manger that's where the wise men found him but in the second coming it is pulling the seals away from the world and unveiling himself before usually amen amen let me take about 10 15 minutes he says now to him that is the power according to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began praise God so the revelation of the Mysteries which is from himself making himself known this is where the wise men are gathering too to the revealing of Christ in the first coming they gathered in the manger but now here everything I know they are gatherings amen Amina but now it's made manifested by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith he is revealing himself as John 1 1. Hallelujah in the beginning was the world revealing himself [Music] the anointed [Applause] amen Amina he is revealing himself as John 1 1. put your videos you don't give them anything and they take it no they know what they are located they went into Jerusalem they were mistaken a little bit when they were there they said this is not what it is and today now the wise men have been in all this kind of organizations and all kinds of teachings but finally after the revelation of the world revealing the person of the Lord Jesus Christ making us different there is something real evaluation so that's what it is we are sliding into the seventh seal today the manifestation of it and let me tell you right there hey you it will be creative power right is it is creating something accrediting to out of nothing allowing us that weakness to experience the life of the world he created in Genesis in the beginning but then time came but God gave Moses the opportunity to use the creative anointing foreign hahaha praise God I said one time here when I was teaching and I said God has given us the authority to create and I said you can create your own opportunity you can create your own job he says Pastor I'm creating my job he created his own big business are you together that's what God is doing you are going to test that once you come to Christ with all reality you believe him you are free from sin you will have come back to your adoption to the time before the foreign [Applause] foreign it's not making noise is coming to the reality of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Applause] that's what the wisdom from the East is bringing you too [Applause] when you come to him Christ made the Manifest you can speak mountains out of your ways you can speak life in your home amen you can say anything because we are not coming to the bed because the fullness of the Lord is now present once you discover it is lift up your voices this is a different form of thing that we are coming to yeah not a form of religion brother but being restored to the reality of Christ Solomon says wisdom has builded his house on Seven Pillars and all those Seven Pillars are over you through the seven churches now we are living in the time of the dedication of the temple let the glory of God come and fill the house [Applause] do you appreciate our pastor [Applause] amen sing that song not by power
