Brother Hillary he was around. &gt;&gt; Okay. You know last time when we had brother Tim do preaching and then he was preaching about you know I think it was about the birth talking about the spirit and the soul and then the body when was in November. Brother Hillary testified in the forum that he had never known the difference between the soul and the human spirit. and how they affect our relationship with God. But he says that sermon of brother Tim which opened all his eyes. Praise the name of our Lord. You know sometimes you may keep on coming but there is always a day that the Lord can open your eyes to the reality. So just keep on coming you know like the unsapter 8 when he went to worship and he was coming back God sent Philillip praise the name of our Lord and he was busy reading his Bible. So even as we keep on reading our Bibles, we keep on reading our message books. Sometimes you may not understand the things but keep on being faithful, reading, meditating upon it, coming to the services. One day God can send Philillip to you who will bring these things plain to you. And these are our Philips amongst us. Praise the name of our Lord coming from a far land with a special message. open our eyes to some of these things we may not be able to understand. Praise the name of our Lord. So we're going to brother, &gt;&gt; let us sing that song. Redeemed how I love to proclaim it. Psalm 100. Let us stand up. 140 if you can give me a key. I don't know.

Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. The sheep of his pasture. We don't belong in anybody else's pasture, but we're his sheep. &gt;&gt; He said, "I won't lose one of them." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's good good to be in the house of the Lord once again. Amen. Why don't we Why don't we just take our Bibles together and we want to turn to the book of John, chapter 14. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself. Amen. &gt;&gt; That where I am, there you may be also. and whether I whether I go you know and the way you know. &gt;&gt; Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whether thou goest, how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. Amen. Let's pray together. Blessed heavenly father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we are just reaching out to you tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, what what good would it do, Father, &gt;&gt; to try to stand here and and say anything without your spirit? The letter killth, but the spirit giveth life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask that you would come tonight. &gt;&gt; Give us strength, Lord. &gt;&gt; Give us your uncction, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Lord, as as you speak, may we open our mouth to allow you to speak through us, oh God. Open our hearts to hear your voice, Lord. Lord, we just commit this service to you. In Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You could have your seats. Jesus says, &gt;&gt; "I'm going to prepare a place for you. says, "If if I go to prepare a place for you, &gt;&gt; it wouldn't do no good for me to make you a place and then leave you down here." But he says, "If I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again &gt;&gt; and receive you to myself. that where I am &gt;&gt; there you may be also. &gt;&gt; He says where I am &gt;&gt; not where I go &gt;&gt; but that where I am there you may be also. &gt;&gt; So where where was he? while they were looking at him. He's saying, "Well, you're right here. We're already here with you. Where where else could we could we find you?" &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Where else would we go?" You alone have the words of eternal life. But there was something that they were missing, something that they didn't have access to. that Jesus had access to. &gt;&gt; And he says where I am, I want you to be in that same place. [Music] The fellowship that I have with the father, I want you to come into that fellowship as well. &gt;&gt; So I need to go and finish the work so that you can come into fellowship. He says, "The way, you know, and where I'm going, you know." They said, "We don't know the way." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the way." &gt;&gt; They didn't Jesus wasn't saying, "You should already have it figured out." He says, "You know the way because you know me. You don't realize it, but you already know the way. You've been walking with the way. You've been talking with the way. You've been in fellowship with the way. And I must complete the way so that where I am, there you may also be. In John chapter 3, he says, "No man ascends up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven," so there he was standing in their midst. But he was also in heaven. Amen. He was still connected to that place of fellowship. He was still connected to the place where God dwelt. There there was no no uh chasm between him and God. But he and God were one. And he's saying, "What I have now, you must also have the same thing." &gt;&gt; Right now, I am in heaven. &gt;&gt; And I want you to also be in heaven. &gt;&gt; Even though you are still on earth, you must be connected to heaven. And when he finished the work, he bridged the gap between heaven and earth that through the blood of Jesus Christ, we could be seated in heavenly places in heaven. [Applause] Therefore, we must walk after the spirit and not after the flesh. As long as we're walking in the flesh, this is what we see. We think, well, I'm not in heaven. I I all I see around me are my faults. I see this flesh, this mortal body that doesn't live the way that I want it to live. But the scripture says, "They that walk in the spirit, they that are led by the spirit of God. They are the sons of God. They're seated in heavenly places. They're not looking at what these five senses can see. But they're walking by what has happened on the inside. They're walking by a connection that now ties them to heaven. Amen. Amen. He said, "At that day, as we quoted this morning, you'll know that I'm in the Father that I'm in you and you're in me. That day is this day." So, this message came to show us that he is in us and we can say amen to that. But we are also in him. [Music] &gt;&gt; If we don't recognize it yet, then we need to say, "Lord, for us, Lord, let me recognize all that you did for me." That you didn't just pay the price for my salvation, but you paid the price for complete redemption. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "When the bride recognizes who she is, then should be an invincible army, then the gates of hell cannot prevail against her. All the armies of the enemy won't be able to touch you. Not because you became something different. But because you recognize who you are, &gt;&gt; when you recognize that where he is, you are also in Hebrews 10, scripture says, says, "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days. Verse 16, &gt;&gt; sayaeth the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in my minds will I write them. and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. If we could recognize that we wouldn't fear the trials of life anymore. Because when we don't see that, then we think, well, I'm going through this cuz I deserve it. I'm going through this cuz I did something wrong. I'm going through this cuz I did something bad. No, his their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. [Music] And where remission of these is, there's no more offering for sin. Your trials don't pay for your sins. Your trials don't pay for your iniquities. They don't pay for your mistakes. Your trials mold you. The blood of Jesus Christ paid for every mistake, paid for every sin, paid for every iniquity. [Music] Says, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. Amen. By a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh &gt;&gt; beyond the veil. So what was beyond the veil? &gt;&gt; The place of fellowship. &gt;&gt; God said to Moses, "By the veil, between the wings of the cherubim, there's where I will commune with you. There's where communion is. fellowship with God beyond the veil in that secret place in the place where God dwells. And and Paul says, we can have boldness to enter into that place. That was the place that you belonged. That was the place. That was your place. &gt;&gt; That was the place that that Adam and Eve were barred from entering. What was what was on the the veil of the holy place, the holy of holies was cherubim. Moses making it after the pattern he saw in heaven. And what was standing guarding the way into the Garden of Eden? Cherubam guarding the entrance. The entrance back into fellowship with God. The entrance back into the place where God dwells. the place where you belong. Jesus said, "I'm going to prepare that place. That where I am, there you may be also. &gt;&gt; I'm the way. I'm the truth. I'm the tree of life." &gt;&gt; Amen. So those cherubims were guarding the way back to the tree of life. God said to Adam and Eve that came to combat it. When the red horse rider rode forth, there was an anointing there to combat it. When the black horse rider went forth, there was an anointing there to combat it. when the the pale horse rolled forth. There was an anointing there to combat it. Nothing could come past these beasts. These living creatures though they they could affect the earth. They could they could have an impact upon the world around them. whatever God allowed them to have yet. They couldn't touch the throne of God. They couldn't touch that place. &gt;&gt; It was protected &gt;&gt; behind the cherubim. But now there came a time when those seals begin to break in as we talked about this morning in the the breaking of those seals in in how that that each one of those seals begin to open God opening his book, not to the world, but to those that would receive the word. If you come in with your own ideas and you come in with your own interpretation, trying to bring the anointing of some system with you, trying to bring some anointing of the world with you. There's a there's a guard standing in the way saying you cannot come beyond this. You cannot see what is inside of here. The only way to come into there is through the way that has been made. And Christ is the way that has been made. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. So when he comes and reveals the seals because he's the only one that could open the book, he's the only one that could break those seals. And so when he comes down in the in the seventh angel's message, as he begins to sound, Christ now begins to reveal those mysteries through that message. Christ, the mystery of God revealed. The only way to come in is to accept the word of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus says, I am the way. I am the truth. I am the life. It doesn't matter how much we might disagree. But the word when God reveals his word that is the truth. [Applause] We must accept it. If we refuse to accept God's revealing of those seals and want to stay with our own interpretation, then we are SEALING THE BOOK BACK UP TO OURSELVES. AND YOU cannot go in. But those that are born of the spirit. Jesus said, "Except a man be born again." Now when you come in this day, this revelation, the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. So when he comes in your day, your day happens to be in the revealing of the word. Your day happens to be when the seals are open. &gt;&gt; So to accept the word in your day is to accept the message of this hour. There was messages for every hour. That was Christ revealing himself IN THAT AGE. BUT TODAY IS not yesterday. Today is today. And we need the revelation of Jesus Christ for today. And and because you you're now living in the opening of the word to receive Christ is to receive the opening of those seals. to receive this message will take you right into the mystery of God. Brother Brandham says, "Oh, come take the tree of life." Now, instead of the cherubims, he says, "I want to say something. Instead of those cherubims guarding this throne, They're out here seeking, trying to run people to the throne, trying to bring them through the gate, back to the tree of life again, that they might take this. So when you come under the breaking of those seals, you receive Christ in your day as he reveals himself to you. He says you must be baptized in my name because I am the way. There's no other name given under heaven. You can't be baptized in the titles, &gt;&gt; but you've got to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because he's the only one that can bring you in. So when you accept now that truth and he quickens it to you by his spirit and you're born again by the spirit of God. Now as we heard this morning there that's not the end of it that there's NO LIMIT TO GOD'S POWER. There's no summit. But now you've accepted the word in your day and now he is taking you in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, those those cherubims." What about those great living creatures with their six wings crying out holy, holy, and the post of the temple were shaking at the sound of their voice. But but Christ now has brought you through there. He says they're actually standing on the outside now. You're on the inside. Those creatures that you afraid of, they're actually guarding you. Because you're not on the outside looking in, but you're ON THE INSIDE LOOKING OUT. At that day, you'll know that I'm in you and in me. [Applause] Oh, YOU CAN SEE GOD'S PROTECTION around you. The scripture says, "Who will lay anything to the charge of God's life? Who is he that condemnth? Who is he that's able to get beyond the protection of God's anointing? It's Christ that died. He's the one that now has brought them under his protection. Brought them into the throne room. They've been ushered in there. and you come and you see that that fifth seal, those souls under the altar, the Lord says, "That's not you. That's that's not your place. Come in a little further and you see that sixth seal before you that tribulation that is to come upon the world. Men's hearts failing for fear and your heart was once failing for fear. But now you've come into Christ. How you can, he says, you can't be touched by that. He says, how can I bring you through the judgment? You've already accepted the blood of the lamb. Your sins and iniquities I can remember no more. &gt;&gt; So he brings you in beyond that. into that seventh seal. Some people want to say the seventh seal isn't revealed. That's just because they haven't been inside. But if the seven seals not revealed, then the mystery of God can't be finished. But Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And now Christ is bringing his bride. And through that seventh seal, we come to this place. What is this place? It it's it's something something that can't be explained. You're now being ushered beyond the veil. [Music] You're now coming into the Holy of Holies. You're coming into a place that shuts the world out. YOU COME INTO A PLACE where it's you and God alone. You become a mystic to the world. &gt;&gt; The world can't understand you. You can't explain it to the world, but you've COME INTO FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD. You're now walking with him and him alone. He is your satisfying place. He is your peace. He is your joy. He is your overcoming. &gt;&gt; He is your provision. He said, "I'm going to prepare a place for you." So that where I am there you can be also the revelation of Jesus Christ. The third pole then the opening of the seals the capstone message of grace. The mystery of God a hidden room. You can't explain it. It's a revelation. It's you and God alone walking together in the Garden of Eden once again. Not not in this flesh, but in the soul. You've been sealed into Christ. Brother Brandham said, "You can no more die than God can die. God and man become one. He says this. Brother Brandham says this is God's great mystery of love expressed that God and man became one. The whole thing is God and man one. God and man was one there. And God and man is one here. So what is it? Being filled with his spirit him having the preeminences that was God's achievement. God's achievement. That's God's purpose to do that. that he might be in Christ and Christ in us in all of us together one. &gt;&gt; That was Paul's desire. Brother Brandham said, "I preach the same message that Paul preached." And the saints beyond the veil, they said, "We're resting on that. We're resting on that." [Applause] In Ephesians chapter 3, &gt;&gt; Paul says, "For this cause I bow my knees," verse 14, "for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Ephesians 3 verse 14. It's your &gt;&gt; It's a lot shorter in your language. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let's go now to verse 17. &gt;&gt; So, so this is now part of Paul's prayer. Says, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height. and to know the love of Christ that passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what was Paul's desire? The same thing brother Brandham preached. That Christ would be in us. That let me just read it again. Christ in us and all of us together one. All that was in Christ, all that was in God, he poured into Christ. And all that was in Christ, he poured into the church that he might have the preeminences that he might bring her back to the Garden of Eden once again, [Music] back into fellowship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you, &gt;&gt; the bride, &gt;&gt; might be filled with all the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; Now you are on the inside looking out. You have entered into the throne room. &gt;&gt; That's where you belong. Paul said you can have boldness to enter into [Music] &gt;&gt; God has enthroned himself in you. [Music] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 7 says Solomon built him a house. I'll try to go slowly. But the Most High doesn't dwell in temples made with hands. [Music] Heaven is your throne. God says, "Heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool. What house will you build for me?" What is the place of my rest? Amen. In &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2 says, "You are therefore no more strangers and foreigners, &gt;&gt; but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God, and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. Yes, in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord, in whom also you are built together. for a habitation of God through the spirit. &gt;&gt; So God has enthroned himself within your heart. &gt;&gt; The new birth now the spirit of God dwells within your soul. God dwells in you. God enthroned in your heart and we have been builded up into the habitation of the Lord. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 12 says, "You are come unto Mount Zion, &gt;&gt; unto the city of the living God, &gt;&gt; the heavenly Jerusalem. This is where you are come to." Amen. &gt;&gt; Not where you are going. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Revelations 21. &gt;&gt; Here we see the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; But you are come to the heavenly Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; You are there already. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what do we see here in Revelations 21? [Music] Let's start reading at verse n. And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the lamb's wife. Hallelujah. And he carried me away in the spirit. So where was the new Jerusalem? It was in heaven. Jerusalem. But now this is after the millennium. Now the the heavenly Jerusalem begins to descend out of heaven, descending into this dimension, descending down to where it can be seen. By the eyes of man, I saw a new heaven and a new earth. And now the presence of God is coming down to dwell on the earth. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and when he when he sees the new Jerusalem, the angel says, "Let me show you the bride. Where's the bride? She's seated in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. one day. This mortal body will be quickened and we will step into that place as a Christ. And one day then that place, that presence of God, that place where we dwell descends down onto the earth. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm making a way for you." He &gt;&gt; He said, "I go to prepare a place for you. And when I've prepared that place, I will come and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also. So we know that we've entered in beyond the veil. &gt;&gt; We know we've entered in to the throne of God. Brother Brandham says those cherubims are ushering us into the throne of God. You're built upon the foundation of the apostles. &gt;&gt; You are this heavenly Jerusalem. Amen. &gt;&gt; In in verse 22, &gt;&gt; oh I'm sorry. verse let's let's keep reading here in verse 11 &gt;&gt; having the glory of God and her light was like a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal ginger and and had a wall great and high, and had 12 gates, and at the gates 12 angels, and names written thereon, which were the names of the 12 tribes of the children of Israel. In verse 14, and the wall of the city had 12 foundations, and in them the names of the 12 apostles of the lamb. Amen. What is built upon the foundation of the twel apostles? You are being built upon the foundation of the twel apostles. Jesus said the kingdom of heaven is within you. God is building himself a habitation. [Music] &gt;&gt; And and when the new Jerusalem begins to descend down, now we don't see thunderings and lightnings. Now the light of God is shining through his bride. God has now completed his plan. And the light of God is shining through the bride of Christ. And that light is like a stone most precious. This is the way that God desired to reflect himself was through the the through his sons and daughters through the life of his bride. Jesus said, "You are the light of the world. Hill cannot be hid. You are meant to shine your light to the world. &gt;&gt; Right now, the world sees this flesh. They see your mistakes. They see every every time you fall short, they say, "How could that be God? But you're not looking at those things. You're looking at Christ. You're looking beyond the veil. You're in fellowship with God. to you. It doesn't matter what the world thinks because you're in a world with you and God alone. &gt;&gt; And that world has not yet descended into the physical, but you are seated in heavenly places. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what you've been sealed into by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Now, what comes out of the heavenly Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; we can see that that is us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that is us now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That God has enthroned himself in us. &gt;&gt; So now what comes out of this throne? What? How? Why has God made us this way? What was God's design? What was his purpose in bringing sons and daughters to himself? That he might be become the complete expression of himself. Because you are the attributes of God. You are a part of him and he's molded your life in a certain way. because he wants to shine through your life in a certain way. Not someday a thousand years from now when we rule and reign with him. Though though we shall be his expression in that day, but today you are his expression. You are the word in flesh in your day. The bride is the new Jerusalem today. So now what should flow out from her? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What should flow out from her? We want we want thunderings. We want lightning. We want to strike this one. Strike that one. Do away with this stuff. Speak the power of God. But that's not God's design. God is the immutable God. He is unchangeable in his ways. So when the heavenly Jerusalem comes down, &gt;&gt; it's not a different idea, it's not a different purpose, but it's the same God expressing himself in his complete form. So if if he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, then the way that he will express himself in the new Jerusalem, in the new heavens, [Music] the way the the bride will be expressed in that day must be the way the bride is expressed today. So what then is meant to come out from the heavenly Jerusalem? &gt;&gt; We are on the inside looking out. Now what is supposed to flow from the inside to the outside? In Revelations 22 says, "And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. So now that God is expressing himself through a bride, we don't see thunderings and lightnings in mysteries. We see a river of the water of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; John chapter 7 says, "In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, if any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. And he that believeth on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. Amen. Says this, he spake of the spirit, which they that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. But but that was what he was. So So now he's saying by his spirit. When you drink of that spirit now out of you shall flow rivers of living water. The same expression of the bride in the new heavens and new earth is the same way God wants to express himself through you today. &gt;&gt; That's who you are called to be a vessel of God. a channel through which the rivers of life can flow. Amen. &gt;&gt; In verse 17 says, "The spirit and the bride say come." And let him that heareth say, "Come." Let him that is a thirst come. Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. So now we see the spirit in the bride. They've become united. They're saying the same thing. They're saying, "Come and drink of these waters." Bible says, "Judge no man. that you be not judged. We're not called to walk around pronouncing judgment. We're called to cry, "Come, drink of the waters of life. Whosoever will, let him come." That's your calling. That the spirit of God might speak through you. that his spirit would live through you, that your life would become a reflection of him. Amen. Verse two, it says, "In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, that was the tree of life, which bear 12 manner of fruit and yielded her fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations." Uh, Revelations 22:2 Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are the vessel of God's love. The fruit of the spirit is love and joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, meekness, goodness, faith. Against such there is no law. You're called to bear the fruit of Christ, to bear the fruit of the tree of life. He says, "I'm the vine. You're the branches." Where do we find the leaves? We find the leaves in the branches. the spirit pouring out through Christ through your life to bring healing to whosoever will whosoever will receive [Applause] &gt;&gt; in the message restoration of the bride tree he says what is fellowship ship. What do the leaves do? Makes it cool. Where the birds fly in under the leaves to cool off. There's your tree again. He shall be like a tree that's planted. &gt;&gt; Who will be like a tree that's planted? &gt;&gt; That's Psalms chapter one. &gt;&gt; Somebody's somebody's having their good time. Well, we're having our good time says, "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. He shall be like a tree planted by rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season. His leaf also shall not wither and whatever he doeth shall prosper. Amen. Amen. whose whose delight is in the law of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's many that delight in laying down the law in in bringing persecution with the law. But whose delight is in the law of the Lord? Whose delight is in that word of God? Who wants to meditate day and night on his law? Only the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because with the bride, &gt;&gt; she's come under a new covenant and his law has been written upon the tables of &gt;&gt; So, brother Brennham says he'll be like a tree that's planted where people can come and sit down under the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. cool off a little bit. You're all flustered and don't know what's happened. Whether you die, whether you're saved, [Music] whether you're saved or not, you don't know whether this church is right or that is right. Just come down under the tree that's got some leaves on it. Set the set down there. Let the winds of heaven go to blowing like a rushing mighty wind through the leaves, you know, and you begin to cool off a little bit. The fellowship in the spirit of Christ &gt;&gt; flowing through your life brings healing. Amen. &gt;&gt; How does that how does that come into practice? When we sit there in our living room and just begin to pray and just try to be so holy. Hush children, I'm praying. Hush wife, I'm praying. No, he says, "When you pray, go into your prayer closet. When you pray, go into your closet &gt;&gt; that the God which sees in secret might reward you openly. So how then is is this practiced? How can we create this atmosphere of love? How can we let the spirit of God flow through us? Brother Brandham came into his home one time and his wife was all upset and his children were fighting and he came in and he put his wife's apron on. her ap her uh kitchen apron and he goes to the sink. and and he begins to wash the dishes. [Music] &gt;&gt; And and he begins to talk about that he's going to make supper for the family. His wife says, "Oh, you can't make supper." You know, like like our wives would say to us. At least I know my wife would say to me, she'd say, "You're not going to cook supper. Nobody's going to want to eat that." But but it began to change the atmosphere. [Music] The love of God begin to come on the scene. Soon his wife was happy. Soon the children were playing nicely. Why? Because he had changed the atmosphere. Not by coming in and laying down the law, saying this is how you're supposed to act. You should have supper on THE TABLE BY NOW. KIDS. I'VE TOLD YOU not to fight. No, that wouldn't have expressed the love of God. But when he came in the humility and just began to to let the spirit of God move, not saying, "I'm going to bring the spirit of God on the scene." But no, he's just praying on the inside. [Music] Lord, give me inspiration. Give me leadership. Now, if the Holy Spirit told us just go and wash the dishes. &gt;&gt; Would we be humble enough to Amen. &gt;&gt; What What about sisters? May maybe the children are all frustrated and we want to just set them down and give them a good licking. But maybe we haven't been in the right atmosphere, maybe instead of trying to push them off to the side, say, "Oh, go entertain yourselves. [Music] go and find something to do. We need to sit down with them and maybe begin to play with them a little bit. Maybe begin to enter into their conversation. begin to come down to their level that the spirit of God can begin to move in our home, in our places of work. The spirit of God wants to move. Not Not everyone can receive it. That's right. &gt;&gt; But you have a promise. says, "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." You didn't come in there into work to try to set everything straight, but you've come in there to be a representation of Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the word walking amongst your workplace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says you're anointed messiahs to this age. [Music] In perfect faith, brother Brennham says, "Now faith is based on forgiveness. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And then as we said this morning, &gt;&gt; trying to get the church into a place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us. That's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door. We see it, but we want to see more of it. We want it to be such a flow that it'll be a help to us. Us flow out to others. [Music] Says remember Jesus never used his power for himself. [Music] That's what it was. He He used it for others. &gt;&gt; That's what it was sent for. &gt;&gt; Can you see who you are today? &gt;&gt; You are the salt of the earth. You are the light of the world. your living epistles read of all men. [Music] &gt;&gt; You are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; You are what he has built. Amen. &gt;&gt; Created in Christ Jesus unto good works. That's right. that God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Wherefore we receiving a kingdom that cannot be moved, &gt;&gt; who can separate us from the love of God? You're on the inside looking out. You are protected by God. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom that cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. Let your light so shine before men [Music] that they might see your good works and glorify your father. God has called you to be his voice to be the manifestation of his word in this day to be a conduit through which his love can flow. One one day that new Jerusalem will come down in the flesh and we shall reign and rule with him forever. &gt;&gt; But right now, you are the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't wait. Don't wait and say over on the other side will be an expression of God. [Music] But he wants to flow through you right now. In every trial you're going through, &gt;&gt; he wants to express himself. In every situation you come up against, he wants to express himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us give him room. Let us just be the candle that his light is shining from. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we just love you so much. And Lord, we we want to be all that you want us to be. Lord, we want to express you in the way that you want to be expressed. Lord, you have a design. You have a purpose. You have a thought. we were before the foundation of the world. And Lord, as we come into manifestation in our day, forgive us for trying to be who we wanted to be. Lord, we want to lay all those things down. We lay down our own ambitions. We lay down our own dreams. Say, "Father, not my will, but thine be done. Let us be found in your will, Lord." Lord, if we have come outside of your will. We pray that your spirit would bring us back under the blood today, Lord. that we can walk before you that we can express you, that we can express your love to those that are so in need of it. Lord, that they might know the grace of God that we have received. Grant it, Father, we pray to commit ourselves into your hands. In &gt;&gt; Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
