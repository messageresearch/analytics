[47:18] can you read it with me
[47:21] let's just read it like it's in the
[47:22] board
[47:23] then the soldiers of the governor took
[47:27] Jesus into the common hole and gathered
[47:30] unto him the whole band of soldiers
[47:39] next verse
[47:42] and they stripped him and put on him a
[47:46] Scarlet room yes
[47:50] next verse
[47:53] and when they had planted a crown of
[47:55] thorns they put it upon his head and
[47:59] they read in his right hand and they
[48:01] bowed the knee before him and mocked him
[48:04] saying hail King of the Jews
[48:15] next verse
[48:18] and they spit upon him and took the Reed
[48:22] and smote him on the head yes
[48:28] let's read that again
[48:30] and they spit on him and took the Reed
[48:34] and smote him on the head yes
[48:40] next verse
[48:43] and after they had mocked him they took
[48:46] the robe off from him and put his own
[48:49] Raymond on him and led him away to
[48:53] crucify him yes
[49:00] next verse
[49:03] and as they came out they found a man of
[49:06] sereni Simon by name him they compelled
[49:09] to bear his cross
[49:15] next verse
[49:18] and when they were come into a place
[49:20] called Golgotha that is to say a place
[49:23] of a skull
[49:25] because
[49:29] next verse
[49:32] they gave him vinegar to drink mingle
[49:35] with gall and when he had tasted thereof
[49:37] he would not drink
[49:43] next verse
[49:46] and they crucified him and parted his
[49:49] garments casting lots that it might be
[49:52] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[49:54] prophet they pardoned my garments among
[49:57] them and upon my vesture did they cast
[49:59] lots
[50:09] let us pray foreign
[50:13] we've read one of the most tremendous if
[50:16] not the most tremendous
[50:20] scriptures in the Bible
[50:23] where you paid
[50:25] for our sins
[50:28] Lord may we never forget that
[50:31] day on Calvary is we pray Lord Jesus
[50:36] Jesus that you help us today
[50:39] as we try to help each other
[50:44] with the word that you have spoken
[50:53] thank you Lord Jesus gracias Jesus you

[50:59] the honor and Glory
[51:02] it belongs to you
[51:04] we thank you Father yeah
[51:13] in the first place
[51:17] I hope I can hear myself
[51:20] I don't know what's happening to my ears
[51:23] I can hardly hear it
[51:26] so if I
[51:28] hollerito forgive me now my intention to
[51:32] do that
[51:35] it's it's
[51:36] just something it's solo album
[51:41] we have a
[51:42] a privilege the name is
[51:46] how many know that we have a great
[51:47] privilege
[51:50] you know what the Privileges sounds the
[51:52] quality privilege you
[51:54] to come to the house of the Lord
[51:58] it's a great privilege
[52:01] I remember years ago
[52:06] for me but I mean
[52:09] I was passing through that road could
[52:11] you stop us and
[52:14] it was impressed upon me by the holy
[52:16] ghosts
[52:22] to build this church
[52:24] Iglesia my brother Abraham was with me
[52:30] but
[52:31] it's been a few years back
[52:37] and uh
[52:40] when Billy Paul was here
[52:43] we were in the tape room
[52:47] and
[52:49] he told me these words
[52:52] he said brother Tommy hermano Tomas
[52:56] you have a nice church
[52:58] he said you know what the beauty of it
[53:01] is
[53:02] he says that you provide a place
[53:08] for that all of Silver City Silver City
[53:13] will not have an excuse in that day
[53:17] you have opened a place
[53:20] where you
[53:23] bring the eternal life
[53:28] to all this County
[53:30] he said if you have nothing to offered
[53:36] you can offer this to Jesus
[53:39] that you build him a place for people to
[53:43] come and hear the words
[53:46] I thought those were nice words
[53:50] I rejoice and
[53:56] lately or the last week or so
[54:01] there's been a lot of things being said
[54:04] according to Calvary avido muchas cosas
[54:09] especially with the new movie that came
[54:12] out
[54:14] I'm sure most of you have seen it
[54:18] I have not seen it myself
[54:21] but I would like to see it
[54:24] it won't change anything in me than me
[54:28] uh I already know this part but
[54:34] but that doesn't mean that because we
[54:36] know Calvary there is
[54:44] prophet of God says
[54:46] Calvary should be remembered every day
[54:51] I don't think we remember it every day
[54:55] for if we would
[54:59] we would be
[55:01] some type of people
[55:03] we would hardly do anything wrong
[55:08] we will need to be entertained by the
[55:10] world
[55:13] because we remember it every day
[55:18] so
[55:19] it should mean a lot to us
[55:24] what a day that was
[55:28] um
[55:29] the movie they made is called The
[55:32] Passion of the
[55:35] Christo I
[55:37] did hear
[55:39] the interview that Mel Gibson had with
[55:41] Diane Sawyer Mel Gibson
[55:44] and uh
[55:48] um he said he was inspired
[55:50] by the Holy Ghost foreign
[55:56] somebody had to show it
[56:01] there's movies that have been made I
[56:04] peliculas
[56:05] probably the latest movie they made was
[56:08] that Drew the most people was
[56:13] The Lord of the Rings
[56:17] that's based on Bible but a lot of
[56:20] fiction
[56:23] but this certain movie
[56:26] was the 12 hours of Jesus Christ
[56:31] many many strange things happened during
[56:35] the filming of this movie
[56:42] actually happened while they were
[56:43] filming it
[56:46] the the man that was supposed to be
[56:48] Simon asirini El Hombres
[56:51] they were carrying the cross
[56:55] and they fell ikayo and
[57:00] his shoulder was yeah I don't know if it
[57:02] was broken but it was busted pretty good
[57:06] when that happened
[57:09] when they crucified Jesus
[57:12] actual lightning hit the top of the
[57:14] Cross
[57:18] there was fire all around the cross
[57:22] at times Mel Gibson felt like not
[57:26] filming it anymore
[57:29] even felt like suicide ounces
[57:34] and as he describes it
[57:38] in contrast to people
[57:43] or critics
[57:45] that he was against the Jews and so on
[57:48] and so on
[57:50] continue
[57:52] omitted a scripture
[57:54] and there was this scripture
[57:57] on Matthew 27 in Mateo it's not in the
[58:01] movie that's scripture but he had it
[58:06] one of the things that they uh
[58:09] uh theologians
[58:13] were so much against him in Contra was
[58:18] that he didn't portray a
[58:24] Christo that was passionate
[58:29] that's why the movie is called The
[58:31] Passion of the Christ is
[58:34] that he he made him look terrible
[58:39] so then how can you present Jesus Christ
[58:42] on the cross
[58:45] to little children
[58:48] because there's people for caihente that
[58:51] have seen this movie
[58:53] and said they never see it the second
[58:55] time
[58:57] it's too graphic it's my grafica it's
[59:00] it's too terrible
[59:03] they had Bill Mel Gibson about it
[59:08] and he's made this remark is declaration
[59:12] how I portrayed Christ
[59:15] o does not do justice to what they did
[59:19] to him
[59:22] see a lot of people
[59:24] Christians called so-called Christians
[59:26] christianos
[59:34] he went to the cross and they hit him a
[59:37] little bit you know slapped him a little
[59:39] bit
[59:42] they just spit on him like that because
[59:47] Manos
[59:55] I don't think we could describe calories
[1:00:02] so they they they they asked him so many
[1:00:05] questions
[1:00:07] I like
[1:00:09] the answer to this question is
[1:00:14] who really killed him
[1:00:19] the Romans the Romanos or the Jews
[1:00:22] he said well it was under Roman room
[1:00:28] but he said but the Jews
[1:00:31] they are the ones that really crucified
[1:00:34] him
[1:00:36] and that's why they call him
[1:00:38] anti-seminist or whatever and
[1:00:44] Diana
[1:00:50] you and I are really the ones that
[1:00:52] crucified
[1:00:54] crucified and I was watching the report
[1:00:56] and I said
[1:00:58] I said that is the truth is
[1:01:03] I wanted this morning
[1:01:06] uh I don't know if you have it Anthony
[1:01:08] but the three questions
[1:01:12] I gave him to Anthony this morning
[1:01:15] I I want to take it
[1:01:19] tomorrow
[1:01:21] and and I'm bringing out what the
[1:01:23] prophet brought
[1:01:25] I have nothing else to say but what our
[1:01:28] Prophet says
[1:01:30] I'm not here trying to be a great man
[1:01:34] I am not
[1:01:37] sorry but Jesus is
[1:01:41] Calvary should be remembered every day
[1:01:45] can you imagine if every day you got up
[1:01:48] you remember Calvary is
[1:01:52] I mean the people go to the movie
[1:01:56] and they see these Graphics of this
[1:01:59] movie
[1:02:00] and they come out crying he's telling
[1:02:03] yorando and really disgusted with
[1:02:07] himself
[1:02:10] but I wonder
[1:02:13] in a week's time in in
[1:02:18] what they will be lo que sera they'll go
[1:02:22] back to the same routine
[1:02:24] because that day in Calgary
[1:02:29] didn't mean that much to them knowledge
[1:02:31] significance
[1:02:33] if you see it
[1:02:35] you are you're gonna cry and you're
[1:02:39] going to cry and you're going to say
[1:02:41] what a movie
[1:02:43] but what after that is
[1:02:47] I don't have time this morning
[1:02:50] because he gets so rich
[1:02:54] this thing about Calvary is
[1:02:58] that I I wanted to take maybe one
[1:03:01] tomorrow
[1:03:05] three things that they meant to us
[1:03:10] how many know that brother Branham
[1:03:13] uh
[1:03:15] said
[1:03:17] that we should carry a cross in our car
[1:03:20] okay
[1:03:22] and when you see something
[1:03:25] that is not right
[1:03:28] he said always look to the Cross
[1:03:31] okay
[1:03:33] that's one point is
[1:03:36] in another place
[1:03:39] he says you got to look beyond the cross
[1:03:44] man that's another thing I mean but
[1:03:48] there's no way
[1:03:49] to look to the Cross
[1:03:52] to look to the other side of the Cross
[1:03:55] because you don't know what's on the
[1:03:57] other side
[1:03:59] we don't want to get too high-minded
[1:04:04] to say that we have this we are
[1:04:07] possessors of this is
[1:04:11] before we get to the other side
[1:04:14] never go to the other side
[1:04:17] until you see this side
[1:04:20] then you enter in with reverence
[1:04:25] you're not what you think you are
[1:04:29] amen but it was that day
[1:04:36] number one numerono we should seek what
[1:04:40] that day Meant For Us
[1:04:45] everybody would you repeat number one
[1:04:57] then number two would you read it
[1:05:02] oh and nobody knows how to read nobody
[1:05:03] went to school here
[1:05:05] what
[1:05:07] foreign
[1:05:37] again the Nuevo we should seek what that
[1:05:42] day Meant For Us
[1:05:46] what what was said that he got crucified
[1:05:50] crucified what is it okay
[1:05:54] it settled
[1:05:58] terminal
[1:06:00] the same question terminal
[1:06:05] no
[1:06:09] same question
[1:06:11] see I have an advantage over your dad
[1:06:13] you think
[1:06:16] that I know what you're saying
[1:06:19] in two languages
[1:06:21] so I can help him God bless Brothers
[1:06:26] we had off tremendous meetings
[1:06:31] amen God bless him now that's my friend
[1:06:38] amen
[1:06:40] how many get tired
[1:06:43] see if you get tired raise your hands
[1:06:46] you get tired
[1:06:49] I'm answering the first one is
[1:06:53] attention
[1:06:54] if that day meant something to you it's
[1:06:57] yesterday
[1:06:58] you know it's almost every day we say
[1:07:01] I'm so tired
[1:07:05] I heard right
[1:07:11] oh what a drag today okay
[1:07:15] we all do that and nobody works more
[1:07:19] than me yo
[1:07:36] I'm so tired
[1:07:40] amen
[1:07:41] now let's see what that day meant for us
[1:07:46] you know we we go to funerals
[1:07:48] and uh we see like gramita
[1:07:52] mother-in-laws
[1:07:55] how she
[1:07:57] she just went to sleep
[1:08:00] she was laying in bed and she just went
[1:08:03] to sleep she didn't struggle I just
[1:08:04] started to lecture yourself and
[1:08:08] she probably in her says I'm so tired
[1:08:13] but she's not tired no more
[1:08:16] she's resting
[1:08:18] right correct but
[1:08:22] the Bible speaks
[1:08:24] I'm going to take it real slow
[1:08:26] I'm not trying to be as simple as I can
[1:08:29] because I can get into this
[1:08:32] but the Bible speaks
[1:08:36] about arrest
[1:08:41] because we we are tired
[1:08:46] because we live in a world of routine
[1:08:51] how many people
[1:08:54] are tired of their life is
[1:08:58] let's see
[1:09:00] raise your hands if you I won't say your
[1:09:02] promise
[1:09:05] you're tired
[1:09:07] but would you do anything about it
[1:09:11] you're tired
[1:09:13] all right we bien
[1:09:17] cansado
[1:09:23] can you imagine the people that have
[1:09:25] gone on before us
[1:09:28] are they tired
[1:09:32] are they happy
[1:09:33] people listen just as simple as it is
[1:09:38] very happy content do you think
[1:09:42] that is
[1:09:47] are we gonna squirrel hunt in the
[1:09:49] millennium
[1:09:53] he said no sir no senor he says why
[1:09:58] would you want to do that
[1:10:00] he says because I like to squirrel hunt
[1:10:05] he said oh in this life is
[1:10:10] apply the pleasure that you get out of
[1:10:14] squirrel hunting it's the multiplication
[1:10:17] and multiply it by a million
[1:10:21] you see it's it's it's a it's another
[1:10:24] it's another life it's it's otra Vida
[1:10:28] happy Felicia foreign
[1:10:58] Nuevo
[1:11:04] [Music]
[1:11:05] we go fishing
[1:11:09] and we're happy and then we're bored
[1:11:12] because it's too hot
[1:11:17] we go hunting then we get mad because it
[1:11:21] rains all the time we're hunting
[1:11:26] and then the constant word that comes
[1:11:29] from our mouths
[1:11:32] it's so boring I am just so important
[1:11:39] so we flip on the television
[1:11:43] and we look at the television
[1:11:46] find the same movie five ten times
[1:11:53] and then we don't like that so we got a
[1:11:57] little control that we can change it
[1:11:58] then
[1:12:00] we see Sports
[1:12:02] and our team loses
[1:12:05] and we get tired of seeing them loose
[1:12:07] you know
[1:12:08] wait till next year
[1:12:11] everything is next year everything is
[1:12:14] tomorrow
[1:12:17] so you you cannot it doesn't satisfied
[1:12:20] satisfaction so they serve your steaks
[1:12:25] and then after you eat it and your
[1:12:27] stomach is this
[1:12:29] you as yourself
[1:12:32] why did I eat so much
[1:12:36] and then the wife comes what do you want
[1:12:39] to eat today
[1:12:41] I wanna I want this
[1:12:44] and this better be cooked right or I
[1:12:46] won't I don't want it
[1:12:48] then you eat it and then the next day
[1:12:53] the wife says I'm going to make you some
[1:12:56] of this again
[1:12:59] I don't like that I'm tired of that when
[1:13:03] you change your menu a little bit
[1:13:05] and it goes
[1:13:11] well if I could just take a vacation
[1:13:15] so you go on a vacation and you spend
[1:13:19] all your money
[1:13:20] and when you come back you say why did I
[1:13:24] do that
[1:13:25] because the same question has not been
[1:13:28] said
[1:13:32] yesterday
[1:13:43] the same question hasn't been settled
[1:13:46] now in all the things I mentioned
[1:13:50] it's not wrong to have another house
[1:13:54] or to take a little vacation
[1:13:58] but remember one thing you're going to
[1:14:01] be tired until you find out
[1:14:05] what that day meant for you
[1:14:09] what Calvary meant for me
[1:14:13] we worry about our children
[1:14:19] do you know that we worry more for
[1:14:21] children that are married than for those
[1:14:22] that are not married
[1:14:27] we worry about them
[1:14:29] we worry about everything
[1:14:32] we're a nervous wreck
[1:14:35] we got a bunch of nerves
[1:14:39] because we're always worried
[1:14:42] and as long as that happens
[1:14:48] doesn't mean that much for us
[1:14:52] what that they meant for us
[1:14:55] we hear preachers
[1:14:58] like you hear me
[1:15:01] and we hear them preach about Calvary
[1:15:08] you want to see my notes
[1:15:10] I want you to watch how many notes
[1:15:14] say all these notes
[1:15:18] I'm going in the same thing but I'm
[1:15:22] preaching them now
[1:15:26] how do you how do you get this
[1:15:29] are you very smart
[1:15:35] but I do believe
[1:15:39] that Calvary meant something to me
[1:15:45] everybody knows I'm a preachers
[1:15:49] what is a preacher yes he is simply a
[1:15:53] public servant supplementation services
[1:16:01] to see what he can preacher
[1:16:08] to help foreign
[1:16:13] that's all now if he preaches for any
[1:16:16] other reason
[1:16:19] are you with me I'm just talking
[1:16:23] I'm preaching do you understand I'm just
[1:16:25] talking to you
[1:16:27] I said good morning friends
[1:16:33] I'm trying to help you
[1:16:35] I pray that I'm trying to help you
[1:16:39] but maybe I preach because I get good
[1:16:42] times
[1:16:46] maybe I preach because it's
[1:16:48] for different reasons
[1:16:52] but but if I don't preacher
[1:16:57] what that day meant for me
[1:17:00] I wanna and if I preach this is your
[1:17:04] predico
[1:17:05] on the third part
[1:17:07] look what we ought to do for that day
[1:17:12] then we have to answer Modis and
[1:17:16] objectives
[1:17:20] amen you see he gets serious he said you
[1:17:24] amen amen that day meant a lot to us
[1:17:31] what did it did why did that day have to
[1:17:35] happen
[1:17:37] you ever think about things that you do
[1:17:41] is
[1:17:45] you'll go back and you say why did I do
[1:17:48] that
[1:17:51] how many of you have done something that
[1:17:54] you wish you never had done I don't know
[1:17:57] because if you all of you don't answer
[1:17:59] your hands you're you're lying because
[1:18:04] has done things
[1:18:07] that we are ashamed of get them and we
[1:18:11] we don't want to remember
[1:18:14] but there's something in us
[1:18:17] that makes us remember
[1:18:20] how would you like to forget it
[1:18:23] is it possible to forget it
[1:18:26] yes see if the sin question is answered
[1:18:32] then you don't have to carry that load
[1:18:35] as long as you still remember it
[1:18:39] that means that day on Calvary
[1:18:42] significant El calvario hasn't really
[1:18:45] happened to you
[1:18:47] you see where the movie
[1:18:49] you're saying that the people can see
[1:18:51] these little things I'm telling you
[1:18:54] know
[1:18:55] most of them can some can't see
[1:19:00] tired cancel
[1:19:03] oppressed
[1:19:06] tired and oppressed
[1:19:09] same thing
[1:19:12] same body
[1:19:15] but every day
[1:19:17] the body takes a little different change
[1:19:20] is
[1:19:22] that right
[1:19:23] I looked in the mirror the other day
[1:19:26] and I said you used to be handsome
[1:19:32] particles
[1:19:35] there's a lot of changes and there will
[1:19:38] be more yeah what do you do it
[1:19:44] I'm sick of myself
[1:19:47] sometimes we're not so sick of other
[1:19:49] people we're sick of ourselves
[1:19:53] and as long as something points us to
[1:19:57] that
[1:19:59] we are feeling that way
[1:20:03] we believe it that way
[1:20:06] the sin question has not been answered
[1:20:09] ah
[1:20:23] why do we go to church
[1:20:25] ask the question why am I in church
[1:20:30] because I want to sing to the Lord
[1:20:33] that's good but that does not answer the
[1:20:37] sin question
[1:20:39] we go to church we want to hear the
[1:20:42] preaching
[1:20:43] that's good it'll help you but that
[1:20:47] still doesn't answer the thing amen
[1:20:53] preachers preach singers singers
[1:20:57] and
[1:20:59] the prophet says I differ with you my
[1:21:02] Pentecostal Brothers
[1:21:04] it's not just going to church I'm
[1:21:06] hitting banging on a tambourine and
[1:21:08] singing songs
[1:21:11] can you see people doing that in the
[1:21:14] church
[1:21:18] and praising God yeah and raise their
[1:21:22] hands
[1:21:23] and one year later you go to the church
[1:21:27] and they're not there no more they stop
[1:21:31] going to church because they were
[1:21:33] seeking something they never found
[1:21:37] that's where I want to get to I is
[1:21:42] never answered
[1:21:44] and they go to church Ivana Iglesia oh
[1:21:47] yes
[1:21:48] and everybody goes to it for everybody
[1:21:51] follows something
[1:21:54] they can find
[1:21:56] the rest
[1:21:58] are you with me they can't find it amen
[1:22:04] amen but when you find it
[1:22:06] what it is what that day Meant For Us
[1:22:12] what did that day do for you
[1:22:17] because if that day meant something
[1:22:19] foreign
[1:22:46] is to settle is the terminal the same
[1:22:49] question
[1:22:51] all right
[1:22:57] how many is tired of this life
[1:23:00] well let's get a new life
[1:23:06] let's start a new life

[1:23:13] for that day meant for us
[1:23:16] if not you know we can be looking for a
[1:23:20] city
[1:23:22] we can be looking for eternal life
[1:23:26] and we can seek so many things
[1:23:31] in ourselves
[1:23:35] individuals
[1:23:36] know what Calvary did for me
[1:23:41] we will always have sin in our lives
[1:23:46] because
[1:24:00] amen amen if not she know you'll go to
[1:24:05] church Iglesia
[1:24:08] how do you like this Foundation pretty
[1:24:09] good foundation because
[1:24:11] I've preached at least five messages
[1:24:15] I'm gonna get to the actual Calvary
[1:24:20] that Calvary is
[1:24:22] Jesus Christ amen
[1:24:27] and I'm gonna explain a little bit that
[1:24:28] they did to him
[1:24:31] but do you know that each one of us
[1:24:35] must have our calories
[1:24:42] we don't pay the price
[1:24:46] but
[1:24:52] we're gonna see there what did they did
[1:24:55] for us
[1:24:59] and then we're gonna see what we should
[1:25:02] do for that day
[1:25:04] it'll get really warm in here
[1:25:08] not to use the word heart no foreign
[1:25:11] amen

[1:25:40] Iglesias
[1:25:41] they teach people
[1:25:47] that they should dress a certain way
[1:25:52] that's all right but they don't settle
[1:25:55] the same questions
[1:25:59] that they should abstain from certain
[1:26:02] things because
[1:26:04] that's fine but they don't sell it
[1:26:10] every church
[1:26:11] every Persona is seeking God is
[1:26:16] but there's a difference
[1:26:19] where it settles the things that
[1:26:25] I might have this wrong
[1:26:29] I don't think so but if you think I'm
[1:26:32] wrong you come and tell me
[1:26:35] I don't believe
[1:26:38] that people
[1:26:40] can find God
[1:26:42] I don't believe it
[1:26:45] I don't believe that anybody has the
[1:26:49] capacity to find God
[1:26:54] they look for him they dress a certain
[1:26:57] way
[1:26:59] they do certain things
[1:27:01] so one says that a woman can wear high
[1:27:04] heels the other one says she cannot work
[1:27:08] they don't settle the same questions
[1:27:12] one says that you can should go to
[1:27:14] church on Saturday one says you can
[1:27:16] should go to church on Sundays
[1:27:20] they're missing the same questions
[1:27:25] I don't believe that
[1:27:30] men
[1:27:32] will find God
[1:27:35] like that
[1:27:37] I don't believe it
[1:27:40] but I do believe foreign
[1:28:00] back to God the regress to adios and
[1:28:03] unless God
[1:28:06] puts that man
[1:28:09] on this Earth not just any roads
[1:28:12] it's one rose
[1:28:17] that leads back to God Amen
[1:28:23] back to God the regressors
[1:28:26] it's back to him it's the regression
[1:28:30] that he won't come
[1:28:33] and you can get on the road
[1:28:37] there's no way you can get on that road
[1:28:42] unless anuser something
[1:28:46] strikes you like Vegas
[1:28:50] on that road back to God the regress
[1:28:54] values you don't have God you're going
[1:28:57] back to God
[1:28:59] you have received something
[1:29:02] that will take you back together
[1:29:07] you understand that I don't think you do
[1:29:11] you know remember I think you understand
[1:29:14] you don't have God
[1:29:16] no what you have
[1:29:18] you have something in your hands
[1:29:22] something in your hands
[1:29:24] that puts you on a roll
[1:29:27] back together
[1:29:32] at any time
[1:29:39] think about it
[1:29:40] just a little bit amen
[1:29:45] it's a sin question is
[1:29:47] and the reason I'm speaking the way I'm
[1:29:49] speaking last morning
[1:29:52] because it's very delicate
[1:29:56] but we're going to settlement
[1:29:59] the same question
[1:30:02] amen amen
[1:30:06] when they hacked him
[1:30:11] you know you saw like I said I haven't
[1:30:14] seen the movie
[1:30:17] but one day I'm gonna give you brother
[1:30:20] Brown's description not Mel Gibson's
[1:30:22] description
[1:30:23] I sincerely believe that Mel Gibson red
[1:30:26] brother branham's books
[1:30:31] and if he didn't he got it from the
[1:30:35] church in Colorado
[1:30:37] one of the largest Pentecostal churches
[1:30:40] in the world
[1:30:42] because he comfort with them
[1:30:46] before he made this movie
[1:30:50] amen he was in Colorado
[1:30:53] Denver Colorado making this movie and
[1:30:57] this was one of the things that critics
[1:30:58] threw the most yes
[1:31:01] well when when they hacked him
[1:31:05] and they they smear him
[1:31:09] the I'm describing brother Brandon
[1:31:12] the leather
[1:31:15] strings I'll call them
[1:31:20] they had big spikes on the end
[1:31:22] centennials
[1:31:24] every time they hit him
[1:31:27] and these spikes would go into his body
[1:31:30] it is
[1:31:34] when they pulled it
[1:31:36] actual flash came out
[1:31:40] when they when they hit him here on the
[1:31:42] side
[1:31:44] this part of this body it didn't just it
[1:31:47] didn't bleach
[1:31:49] the whole flesh came out
[1:31:55] and you could actually see his wrists
[1:31:59] brother Branham describes him element
[1:32:02] he would look like a bunch of hamburgers
[1:32:11] When They Crucified him
[1:32:15] you see some crosses that he had a
[1:32:18] little thing on the middle part of his
[1:32:20] body
[1:32:24] well there was nothing there was no
[1:32:27] clothes
[1:32:30] one mistake that Mel Gibson did
[1:32:34] he put a nice young handsome guy
[1:32:37] portraying Jesus
[1:32:41] Jesus and Jesus was not a handsome man
[1:32:45] in fact Bible says there was no Beauty
[1:32:48] in him
[1:32:53] this man that played the part of Jesus
[1:32:55] said green eyes I believe and and he was
[1:32:57] kind of tall is
[1:32:58] Jesus
[1:33:01] Jesus Christ was five foot four inches
[1:33:04] tall yes
[1:33:13] the beauty of Jesus foreign
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:24] Los Angeles
[1:34:27] man
[1:34:28] and he made Michael
[1:34:30] and Michael was a
[1:34:34] big
[1:34:36] Grande Grande
[1:34:39] pretty good looking
[1:34:40] um
[1:34:41] that's good look at this but
[1:34:47] he was very humble humility and God
[1:34:52] is yours
[1:34:53] walk with them
[1:34:55] and he put charge
[1:35:04] and two
[1:35:06] and to Michael yeah Miguel
[1:35:08] and God is yours
[1:35:11] knowing what he was doing
[1:35:28] God put it in there
[1:35:32] that he didn't put in Michael okay
[1:35:34] Miguel
[1:35:36] so in so because of this little thing
[1:35:39] that God put in luciferation
[1:35:44] Lucifer exalted himself
[1:35:50] watch it when you ask for a
[1:35:55] gifts can
[1:35:58] failure amen
[1:36:05] had a little special foreign
[1:36:35] [Music]
[1:36:40] a question simpatico
[1:36:45] a question okay
[1:36:56] yeah
[1:37:00] that's that's what they use we don't use
[1:37:04] it
[1:37:04] but it's good for Henry that he has me
[1:37:08] for that to help him but he can help me
[1:37:11] too
[1:37:11] because Henry knows a lot of words I
[1:37:14] don't know
[1:37:14] I'm not smarter than him but but if you
[1:37:17] say if he says these words here
[1:37:30] [Applause]
[1:37:39] see he had something
[1:37:42] well in his
[1:37:45] in his way in sumanera
[1:37:48] God yours what you call God
[1:37:53] I'm gonna describe him watch carefully
[1:37:59] see if you can understand me
[1:38:00] I'm gonna describe him as Elohim
[1:38:08] now
[1:38:11] I'm gonna go into the other part
[1:38:14] okay so Elohim
[1:38:20] foreign
[1:38:59] well it was the same
[1:39:02] kingdomeno but it was divided
[1:39:06] but it never should have been
[1:39:10] it had to be once
[1:39:14] but one had control of one part and the
[1:39:17] other one had control of it
[1:39:21] today we have churches
[1:39:24] or we have kingdoms
[1:39:27] or we have a different things like voice
[1:39:32] of restoration
[1:39:40] yeah see divided
[1:39:44] who is Joseph Guinness Jose
[1:39:47] I don't believe in Joseph
[1:39:51] I don't believe in the fightful movies
[1:39:56] I I'm not dealing with the Pentecostals
[1:39:59] I'm dealing with a message
[1:40:04] I believe brother Bernie I believe
[1:40:07] brothers
[1:40:10] and then Paul says is Christ divided
[1:40:17] terminal
[1:40:29] the question has not been said
[1:40:33] and then the prophet says
[1:40:39] many times
[1:40:41] sin did not first begin on the Earth
[1:40:48] sin began in heaven
[1:40:51] amen amen was did God make a man's
[1:40:56] sinful
[1:40:58] I don't know which way I'm going to go
[1:41:00] right now
[1:41:02] I'm waiting on the Holy Ghost to see
[1:41:04] which Rod I'm going to take
[1:41:07] because when they put the man here
[1:41:11] they say man was born of sinful flesh
[1:41:16] of course not everybody a lot of people
[1:41:18] know that man was not born of that the
[1:41:21] flesh
[1:41:33] it was more sinful
[1:41:37] up close to where God lived
[1:41:43] are you with me is
[1:41:45] in what God made
[1:41:48] when God put the man on the edge
[1:41:52] the man was
[1:41:54] without sins
[1:42:04] not with God no condos
[1:42:07] but they you you're going to a question
[1:42:10] and I don't want to go into too many of
[1:42:13] these questions
[1:42:15] concerning the Heaven and the same
[1:42:17] country
[1:42:18] and one question would be who made the
[1:42:21] devil sin
[1:42:23] is who made the devil devil okay Diablo
[1:42:31] who is the one that put this little
[1:42:35] thing in Satan yes
[1:42:40] and I'll tell you who did it
[1:42:43] God himself
[1:42:46] put that otherwise
[1:42:56] what was it insane that he had
[1:43:00] let's call him for this moment he wasn't
[1:43:02] safe and say he was Lucifer son of the
[1:43:05] morning
[1:43:08] do you know that he walked where the
[1:43:12] volcanoes were erupting
[1:43:16] do you know that in those hard rocks hot
[1:43:20] Stones he stepped on us
[1:43:24] do you know that his kingdom that he has
[1:43:28] a beautiful kingdom
[1:43:31] when he came here
[1:43:33] every one of the Angels
[1:43:39] Lucifer hola
[1:43:50] Lucifer
[1:43:52] a they see him over here they say he's
[1:43:55] awesome
[1:43:57] man this creature whatever they call him
[1:44:01] he's so beautiful
[1:44:04] he's so great
[1:44:06] a man
[1:44:08] and that's the way that a lot of
[1:44:10] preachers and a lot of churches think
[1:44:11] they're the greatest yes
[1:44:19] well muy bien
[1:44:22] I'd like to cut in on that but
[1:44:24] I feel checked on it yes
[1:44:30] and I I I leave that a little bit God
[1:44:38] but God gave him that party
[1:44:41] now I want you to think one thing
[1:44:45] every one of us
[1:44:49] there has to be a place
[1:44:52] where God give find their appropriate
[1:44:56] place
[1:45:00] we receive
[1:45:06] it's a tree is
[1:45:16] is
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:46:17] some people can't help it but be Devils
[1:46:20] Diablos
[1:46:23] you know why they don't have a
[1:46:26] representation
[1:46:29] because they said
[1:46:31] the same thing happened here
[1:46:34] the angel Sin is
[1:46:46] Sin was imputed to them
[1:46:51] but probably
[1:46:53] see
[1:46:54] but Peru the Bible says
[1:46:57] blessed is the man
[1:47:02] that's sin quebeca
[1:47:06] is not imputed to him
[1:47:17] it's not imputed
[1:47:19] because if if this Angel sin purchase
[1:47:23] that sin is important to them but if
[1:47:28] this was yesterday because
[1:47:43] who it was
[1:47:45] Guinness
[1:47:49] and the sin was not imputed
[1:47:52] I
[1:47:55] know you had never heard
[1:48:02] did my Angels Sing
[1:48:07] I don't know you want to say
[1:48:10] did your angel sin because
[1:48:15] if my angel didn't sin Simeone
[1:48:18] my angel have no sin no tiene
[1:48:24] but when God made us from this Earth
[1:48:28] there was two aviendos
[1:48:31] Abel and James
[1:48:33] one from Satan who knows and the other
[1:48:37] one from the state of God
[1:48:39] is that right that's what we call
[1:48:42] serpency
[1:48:47] as we were made bar takers
[1:48:53] we were manifested in trash
[1:48:56] we were manifested in French
[1:49:00] God didn't make Adam down here
[1:49:03] first he made him a spirit
[1:49:06] then when he breathed into his Naturals
[1:49:12] amen
[1:49:22] foreign
[1:50:08] but we know that we know the story
[1:50:11] then he got to that rib Costilla
[1:50:17] and he deceived her yeah when he
[1:50:20] deceived him
[1:50:26] no
[1:50:27] no he didn't have nothing Africa
[1:50:29] not a bit of sin
[1:50:32] and God still was with him
[1:50:35] you know you know
[1:50:38] everything's okay
[1:50:40] uh-huh see
[1:50:42] what sins look at PECO was when he took
[1:50:49] his wife and
[1:50:55] committed for he did with her the
[1:50:57] committed
[1:50:59] was what he did that foreign
[1:51:09] I don't know if I can answer this
[1:51:12] was that the sin what he did with her
[1:51:18] foreign
[1:51:59] except except
[1:52:01] that Lucifer Lucifer thought that he
[1:52:05] could do things a little bit better than
[1:52:08] God then circuits
[1:52:10] and that's the same yes
[1:52:16] when you in your life
[1:52:18] think that you can preach this better
[1:52:21] than brother
[1:52:25] a lot of problems
[1:52:44] and that was a
[1:52:46] that he believes he believed that he
[1:52:48] could do could do it better than guys
[1:52:51] well he's gonna try it
[1:52:55] to do it better than God yes
[1:52:58] he's going to try to do it
[1:53:00] so he couldn't handle it he already
[1:53:03] happened
[1:53:05] in his kingdom
[1:53:08] so then he saw God yes
[1:53:11] forming a man
[1:53:13] or another civilization
[1:53:16] he's forming it down here
[1:53:19] and he found a way to get into that
[1:53:23] garden
[1:53:26] and to make it
[1:53:31] he had to
[1:53:33] first look at what was down there
[1:53:37] and he said Adam Adam I can take him
[1:53:44] if ever
[1:53:48] fussy fussy
[1:53:50] I just need somebody to work here
[1:53:57] so he saw Aaron's friend
[1:54:00] the serpent was his friend
[1:54:03] Adam and the serpent were friends
[1:54:07] the Bible says
[1:54:14] and you know the story I'm trying to
[1:54:16] just get to this little park
[1:54:18] I got about 20 minutes
[1:54:26] so you can settle the scene
[1:54:30] well we know how Satan
[1:54:34] that little gift is
[1:54:39] he said this
[1:54:41] so God has said
[1:54:46] he never should have said God has said
[1:54:51] just leave it alone
[1:54:53] oh that's a good part here oh just going
[1:54:56] around me right now
[1:54:58] watch what see what I see
[1:55:02] so God has said
[1:55:05] when the sin question is
[1:55:10] you don't have to tell anybody God said
[1:55:15] did you become part of his nature
[1:55:20] determina
[1:55:45] you give somebody something
[1:55:48] or you do something good
[1:55:51] what do you do you take out your your
[1:55:55] your whistle or your trumpets
[1:55:57] and you Turtle the horn you say you said
[1:56:06] is
[1:56:27] KK Joe
[1:56:30] regalos
[1:56:32] did I pray
[1:56:36] I fasted the other day
[1:56:39] somebody needed help and I helped him
[1:56:42] you don't have to say that
[1:56:46] you automatically leave that the
[1:56:49] automatically
[1:56:52] and if if you don't leave it
[1:56:54] automatically
[1:56:56] the same question has never been settled
[1:56:59] in here
[1:57:01] I don't have to tell somebody I need
[1:57:03] something
[1:57:04] and we always humans hey fall short of
[1:57:08] that
[1:57:10] you do something
[1:57:12] you go to somebody
[1:57:14] you have a need inside of you to help
[1:57:17] this person is
[1:57:24] that's God's nature
[1:57:26] you give usted why did God give foreign
[1:57:33] that's his nature to give life did he
[1:57:38] have to come down
[1:57:40] now here's sin question here's another
[1:57:43] little party
[1:57:46] do you think be crusted that God as a
[1:57:51] man
[1:57:52] hombre called Jesus Jesus
[1:57:57] you say well God is one and Jesus is
[1:57:59] Alive
[1:58:01] no they're not no no soon not in that
[1:58:04] way
[1:58:04] here he expressed himself as men
[1:58:09] and here he expresses himself as God
[1:58:11] yeah
[1:58:13] he is God man
[1:58:15] but he left this part
[1:58:19] to fulfill the part of a man
[1:58:22] was he tempted
[1:58:24] above anybody
[1:58:26] sovere todos in every
[1:58:30] Temptation
[1:58:31] imagine
[1:58:35] he was tempted amen
[1:58:40] as a man I separate now God Joseph you
[1:58:45] can separate them
[1:58:46] but if I can put these parts
[1:58:50] that's what I am a public servant is
[1:58:53] I study your studio to see if I can find
[1:58:56] some way to help you
[1:58:58] as a man he went to the Garden
[1:59:03] Satan sat on us thought and so that he
[1:59:07] could not endure
[1:59:10] in
[1:59:14] um
[1:59:20] and every human Temptation that came to
[1:59:23] him
[1:59:25] he already thought that he had a better
[1:59:29] thing than God
[1:59:33] when he was in the garden
[1:59:38] a part or a secret that pertains to God
[1:59:46] it was hard for him to enter Gethsemane
[1:59:51] and when he went he left his disciples
[1:59:56] and then he took only three years he
[2:00:00] took Peter
[2:00:06] he took him with him and he began to
[2:00:09] pray
[2:00:10] and he prayed do you think that he was
[2:00:14] praying let your will be done
[2:00:18] he was trying to get out of it
[2:00:21] because
[2:00:51] you try not to do this
[2:00:54] but as long as we're in this place is
[2:01:02] foreign
[2:01:41] [Music]
[2:01:45] you gotta says
[2:01:50] it is automatic it's automatically
[2:01:54] I'm not condemned because I drink
[2:01:57] I'm condemned because I have not settled
[2:02:01] the sin questions
[2:02:16] warning how
[2:02:29] hands was his prayer
[2:02:32] Bible says
[2:02:35] he started bleeding
[2:02:39] Thorns

[2:02:43] the Bible says separated
[2:02:53] foreign
[2:03:57] foreign
[2:04:57] yellow
[2:05:23] a few days later
[2:05:47] he was wounded
[2:05:53] that in this last day
[2:05:56] is called God of the Civil age
[2:05:59] and he will conquer
[2:06:02] Every Nation every person he's vicious
