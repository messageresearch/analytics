[34:34] last
[34:36] year pastor of a little
[34:39] church he said brother Morton we were
[34:42] asking about him and he sent brother
[34:43] Morton a little uh a breakdown a little
[34:47] report of what's going on over there in

[34:52] Israel so we just wanted to play that
[34:55] for you amen
[34:58] amen so if we can if we if you can be so

[35:12] 41st and 42nd verse
[35:21] here when you have it you can say
[35:25] Amen
[35:27] amen and while the Pharisees were
[35:29] gathered
[35:30] together Jesus asked
[35:34] them saying what think ye of
[35:41] Christ who son is
[35:44] he and they say unto him the son of
[35:49] David they got out his blessings for the
[35:51] reading of his word you may be
[35:55] seated
[35:57] and uh we're going to ask them if they
[35:59] would put that video
[36:22] up hi friends a short
[36:25] update today we took back control of the
[36:28] surrounding towns around
[36:30] Gaza many tanks have lined up around
[36:33] Gaza to enter by ground
[36:36] Invasion 300,000 Reserve soldiers have
[36:39] been called up and going into Gaza and
[36:42] North to Lebanese border almost everyone
[36:45] has a family member or dear friend going
[36:49] in Rockets from Islamic Jihad and
[36:52] Hezbollah in Lebanon and Soldier
[36:55] infiltration into Israel
[36:58] the Israeli Defense Force has made it
[37:01] clear they are going in to completely
[37:03] destroy Hamas no matter the expense of
[37:07] the
[37:08] hostages 900 plus Israeli casualties
[37:12] total but it is almost certainly much
[37:15] bigger many hostages some of which are
[37:18] British and American
[37:21] citizens Hamas Rockets landed also in
[37:24] the Arab areas such as Bethlehem and
[37:28] mosques the northern border towns have
[37:30] been ordered into shelters
[37:33] today Believers at the moment are all
[37:36] okay many are waiting at any moment to
[37:38] be called into
[37:40] service today we bought some supplies
[37:42] for soldiers and the sense of heaviness
[37:46] dread and emergency as such that has not
[37:49] been felt before in
[37:52] Israel many are shutting themselves in
[37:54] their homes and creating in homemade
[37:57] door jams from wood and metal pipe to
[38:01] effectively lock themselves in the bomb
[38:05] shelter the home front command has
[38:07] ordered all residents to have 72 hours
[38:11] of emergency supplies and be
[38:14] ready we greatly appreciate the prayers
[38:17] and support at this difficult time we
[38:20] know he who keeps Israel is not asleep
[38:24] God bless you brother fiser
[38:29] [Applause]
[38:35] at this at this point there is nothing
[38:38] else to to trust in
[38:42] amen he who keeps Israel is not asleep
[38:45] what a
[38:49] statement as this war started in
[38:54] Israel I have been asked of course many
[38:57] times by many
[39:00] people of course what I think about it
[39:03] right everybody's looking to see well
[39:06] what's going on and where do you see
[39:08] this going and so
[39:11] forth but I try to always look at what's
[39:15] going on around the
[39:18] world always in the scope of the
[39:20] scriptures and through the scope of the
[39:22] message of the
[39:25] hour I don't believe that we can ever
[39:28] understand truly what is going on
[39:29] without understanding the message and
[39:31] the
[39:35] scriptures because without this we would
[39:38] be like anyone else we would be
[39:43] afraid we would be fearful for our
[39:47] lives but as I was reading this and I
[39:49] began to and I just want to put a
[39:51] foundation today on this
[39:55] message building next next Sunday we'll
[39:58] we'll we'll start getting into it a
[39:59] little bit
[40:02] deeper but as we see this and he asked
[40:05] the question that that was very hard for
[40:08] them to to really
[40:12] understand because the way that they
[40:14] view this
[40:17] question they had their minds made up
[40:19] already of what they believed it
[40:23] was what think ye of
[40:28] Christ can you just maybe for a moment
[40:30] just ask your neighbor that
[40:33] question just ask your neighbor neighbor
[40:36] what think ye of
[40:38] Christ the question was asked to the
[40:40] Pharisees and now the question is asked
[40:43] to each one of
[40:46] us whose son is he that's a good one
[40:50] because it put them in a precarious
[40:55] situation
[40:59] they say unto him the son of
[41:01] David so when we look into the
[41:05] Greek we see that Christ uh in the Greek
[41:09] is
[41:11] Christos I think it's up there yes
[41:15] Christ is Christos Christos which means
[41:18] the anointed one or the
[41:21] Messiah in other words what he was
[41:24] asking
[41:25] them
[41:26] what do you think about the anointed
[41:29] one what do you think about
[41:33] Messiah and so he's asking this
[41:35] religious
[41:38] group it would be the same as if he were
[41:40] to ask the rabbis
[41:44] today I believe that they would give the
[41:47] same answer that they gave back
[41:50] then what do you think of
[41:53] Christ well whose son is he he's the son
[41:56] son of
[41:59] David we begin to understand more as we
[42:03] as we get into the
[42:06] message and I began to see this message
[42:08] in a way that I had never seen it
[42:13] before we can very easily we get into
[42:16] the message and and we we hear it Christ
[42:18] is the mystery of God
[42:23] revealed and it's easy to give that
[42:25] answer
[42:28] my question this morning then would
[42:31] be is Christ still a
[42:36] mystery he preached this message years
[42:39] and years
[42:41] ago but we ask the question again is he
[42:45] still is Christ still a
[42:49] mystery maybe to many people he's not a
[42:51] mystery no
[42:53] more if it's been revealed to them
[42:56] but to many many people Christ is still
[42:59] a
[43:01] mystery the Messiah is still a
[43:05] Myster when we look into the message and
[43:07] it tells us that all that God
[43:11] was he poured into
[43:14] Christ then Christ has got to be the the
[43:18] center of
[43:21] everything you'll never understand the
[43:23] mystery of
[43:24] it you never understand who God
[43:28] is without understanding
[43:31] Christ because as brother bradam says in
[43:33] the
[43:35] message he says why why God or Elohim
[43:39] was so
[43:42] great he covered all Space and Time and
[43:47] Eternity he said that he was too
[43:50] mysterious for for us humans to ever
[43:53] understand
[43:55] him
[43:57] how could you understand a a a being
[43:59] that that has had no beginning has no
[44:04] end that covered everything how could
[44:06] you understand
[44:08] that so then the only way that he could
[44:10] express himself we know this we've heard
[44:13] this many
[44:16] times he had to express himself in
[44:20] Christ brother brandham says that Christ
[44:23] is the logos of God
[44:28] can you repeat that after me today
[44:30] Christ is the logos of God don't forget
[44:36] that now Christ must be the center of
[44:39] everything that we
[44:42] do he's got to be the center of our
[44:45] whole
[44:51] lives you believe
[44:53] that all right God had a three-fold
[44:59] purpose can you somebody help me with
[45:02] them well they put it up there and they
[45:04] took it
[45:12] down let's see if our young people know
[45:14] what the three-fold
[45:17] purpose real simple somebody help me out
[45:19] what was the
[45:22] first as we as as we know through life
[45:27] there's a purpose behind
[45:30] everything and that's what we're all
[45:32] we're trying to find
[45:35] out if you're going through a hard time
[45:38] what's the
[45:40] purpose we get so stuck with I'm going
[45:43] through a rough time
[45:46] brother that we never find out the
[45:49] purpose why the rough time
[45:53] came maybe you're struggling with
[45:55] something
[45:57] what's the purpose of it if we don't
[45:59] know the
[46:00] purpose we're always going to be on the
[46:03] on this side of the
[46:06] fence and complaining why we have it the
[46:09] worse than anyone
[46:11] else then to begin to understand God a
[46:16] little we have to understand
[46:20] Christ because there's a purpose why God
[46:23] was doing everything that he's doing
[46:28] the whole plan of God there's a purpose
[46:30] behind
[46:31] it if you catch the the the the plan and
[46:34] what it purpose
[46:37] is there's no reason to freak out when
[46:39] there's a war when there's when there's
[46:41] things going on in this in this
[46:45] world so somebody want to help me out
[46:47] here first the young people come on help
[46:50] God had a three-fold
[46:52] purpose and later on as we get into
[46:55] these messages
[46:57] we're going to find out how this
[46:59] threefold
[47:02] purpose is goes perfectly with the with
[47:06] the three parts of the seven
[47:10] seal but that's just for you to think
[47:13] about I won get there today but number
[47:16] one somebody help
[47:20] me say it out loud if
[47:24] you in
[47:28] first there you go all right we got one
[47:30] over here so number one it's was to
[47:33] reveal himself in
[47:37] Christ everybody in agreement there that
[47:40] was the first thing that was the first
[47:42] purpose you can't find no other purpose
[47:45] if you don't get the first
[47:47] purpose because then you're going to be
[47:49] looking for something else but no no no
[47:51] no you've got to catch it in the order
[47:53] that he gives it
[47:57] number one was to reveal himself in
[48:01] Christ okay number
[48:06] two come on dig deep dig deep on
[48:15] this how how do you even H how can you
[48:18] even know what your purpose
[48:23] is without knowing that God God had a
[48:28] purpose doing what he did you got to
[48:31] find out what his purpose
[48:34] is and in that purpose is where you find
[48:37] your
[48:39] purpose so you got to know these
[48:45] things redeem us yeah but but a little
[48:48] bit more specific that's that's part of
[48:50] the whole plan that's a good
[48:52] answer but but but after revealing
[48:54] himself in Christ
[48:56] Christ his next purpose was
[49:08] to somebody
[49:12] alen okay brother Jim let
[49:19] him amen right number two write these
[49:22] things down you're not going to find
[49:24] purpose without
[49:26] this so number one to reveal himself in
[49:30] Christ to have preeminence in his bride
[49:34] the body of
[49:36] Believers and number
[49:38] three this is the three-fold
[49:42] purpose everything is found in this
[49:45] purpose last one
[49:54] somebody that's all that's in the
[49:57] preeminence what's the third
[50:02] one but good that you
[50:05] try come on somebody nobody has ever
[50:09] read Christ is the
[50:14] mystery okay let let me see how many of
[50:16] you have read Christ as the
[50:18] Myst now now this is a church of
[50:21] Believers of the
[50:23] message I believe brother Ram
[50:26] how many listen to the
[50:31] messages how many have read the message
[50:34] Christ is the mystery of God
[50:38] revealed you can't even
[50:42] fathom this great Elohim without
[50:45] understanding
[50:47] this I'm telling you go home this week
[50:49] and read and hear this message over and
[50:52] over and over
[50:54] again
[50:56] I don't remember how long it is but it's
[50:58] it's it's it's long so
[51:01] what all
[51:03] right all right am the last one is what
[51:07] restom is to restore the kingdom restore
[51:11] us back to
[51:14] Eden okay so everybody got this got to
[51:17] know these purposes number one reveal
[51:19] himself in Christ if that's all I did
[51:22] was go over this and over and over with
[51:24] you today and I I think we we we we will
[51:27] have made some
[51:29] progress to reveal himself in Christ to
[51:33] have preeminence in his bride
[51:36] his and to restore the
[51:39] kingdom then we can now see then what
[51:43] God is
[51:46] doing we cannot look at God's
[51:49] people and the events that surround
[51:54] them without seen them through the lens
[51:56] of God's
[51:59] word without seeing them through the
[52:01] lens of the purpose that God
[52:05] has if I try to understand the the the
[52:08] the modern events made clear by
[52:12] prophecy but I don't see it through the
[52:14] lens of Christ is the
[52:18] mystery never understand the
[52:21] events all I will do is is become afraid
[52:24] every time 's a
[52:26] war and what's going to happen and oh my
[52:30] goodness what will put on the mind of
[52:33] Christ
[52:34] first that's what we are called to
[52:37] do put on his mind first because in his
[52:42] mind we find
[52:44] purpose in his mind we begin to
[52:47] understand what these attributes that
[52:49] were in
[52:52] God we know that then that there is an
[52:54] eternal etal purpose of what is going on
[52:59] here we all know that God or that Israel
[53:02] is God's people
[53:05] amen that's something we've we since we
[53:08] were babies we we understood or we we
[53:12] knew and knowing this
[53:15] then we know that those that bless
[53:19] Israel would be
[53:22] blessed those that cursed Israel
[53:26] will be cursed
[53:27] also we also know that the Jews or
[53:31] Israel is God's time
[53:35] piece so we watch
[53:37] them and especially anything that goes
[53:40] on with
[53:41] Israel the whole world takes
[53:45] note what's going on oh because we just
[53:49] know that there's prophecy being
[53:53] fulfilled whenever
[53:55] this war broke
[53:57] out we we we began to it brings back our
[54:02] understanding of what we've learned
[54:04] about
[54:07] Israel there is roughly 16 million Jews
[54:10] in the world
[54:13] today we know that Hitler killed about a
[54:16] third of them in the
[54:20] 1940s they say about 51% of them live in
[54:23] North America
[54:27] and between 35 and 40% live in
[54:30] Israel now we also know the scripture
[54:33] says that not all Israel is
[54:37] Israel and and and we see that through
[54:40] through many things and I I don't want
[54:42] to get into details right
[54:45] now but we we see that this war started
[54:48] uh uh last
[54:51] weekend it was exactly 50 years
[54:56] after the yam kapor war in
[55:02] 1973 and they say that this is the
[55:05] deadliest or it was the deadliest
[55:11] day for the Jews since the
[55:16] Holocaust so so as I see this unfold and
[55:20] and we all are witnesses to
[55:24] this it brings us then to an
[55:27] understanding of of of or or it causes
[55:29] us to dig deeper into the
[55:33] word things come up because we got to
[55:36] dig a little bit
[55:39] deeper we always look at Wars as oh it's
[55:42] far away it's in Israel and Ukraine and
[55:46] the other side of the
[55:50] world and yet with us we have become so
[55:53] comfortable in our lives
[55:57] we we we don't know what it is to be out
[55:59] to be to be fearful of a rocket hitting
[56:02] or or bombs
[56:06] dropping but believe
[56:08] me our time is
[56:13] coming when I say our time I'm talking
[56:16] about as a
[56:19] whole we don't know what it is really to
[56:23] suffer heartaches we've had hard
[56:27] times I'm not saying it's not
[56:30] rough and we understand that we have a
[56:32] war going on which is which is a
[56:34] spiritual
[56:37] war but if I'm going to understand
[56:39] what's going on I've got to go back to
[56:42] the
[56:45] scriptures Luke the 17th chapter and the
[56:47] 26th
[56:49] verse I just want to read just the very
[56:52] first few part the first part of this
[56:57] scripture we're in Sunday school and I
[56:59] want you to learn
[57:02] this okay now I'm going to hold on what
[57:05] was the first
[57:07] purpose
[57:11] had reveal himself in Christ number
[57:17] two you have preeminence in his bride
[57:20] number
[57:23] three or the kingdom okay make sure
[57:27] you're learning tonight
[57:30] today you just want me to preach 100
[57:32] miles an hour
[57:34] huh no
[57:39] no we're in
[57:42] Africa and we had jumped and shouted all
[57:45] weekend
[57:49] long Sunday morning comes and our pastor
[57:52] founding Pastor he he gets up and he
[57:54] says
[57:55] all right dancing and
[58:00] shouting you haven't learned
[58:03] nothing now sit down and listen I'm
[58:05] going to give you
[58:07] Doctrine you ever seen the most the
[58:09] quietest group of Africans you ever
[58:14] seen but they
[58:15] learned as it was in the days of
[58:19] Noah let's go back and find the
[58:22] condition there just real quick cuz I'm
[58:23] going to get into the to my message but
[58:25] I want to I want to tie this
[58:29] in let's find out the condition in the
[58:32] times of
[58:34] Noah we always go through the same thing
[58:37] yeah in time of L and and there are all
[58:39] these you know homosexuals and
[58:43] D we we can we can go down that road but
[58:46] but I'm going to go down a little bit
[58:47] different road
[58:49] today Genesis 611
[58:52] now we want to tie this
[58:56] together because there's a purpose for
[58:59] this the Earth also was corrupt before
[59:03] God and the Earth was filled with
[59:12] violence God looked upon the Earth and
[59:14] behold it was corrupt for All Flesh had
[59:17] corrupted his way upon the
[59:23] Earth
[59:26] and God said unto Noah the end of all
[59:28] fleshes come before me for the Earth is
[59:31] filled with
[59:39] violence with violence through
[59:42] them and behold I will destroy them from
[59:44] the
[59:46] earth this is not
[59:49] coincidence if you notice those two
[59:52] verses the first and the last one
[59:56] did you that it used the word violence
[1:00:01] twice anybody as it was in the days of
[1:00:05] Noah there was
[1:00:07] violence if you go into the
[1:00:10] Hebrew the very word
[1:00:14] violence
[1:00:19] isas okay do I have your attention
[1:00:22] now all right now this is what's going
[1:00:25] on
[1:00:26] here that's why we're trying to find how
[1:00:28] things connect no no no the Holy Spirit
[1:00:30] already has told
[1:00:33] us the very word violence in Hebrew is
[1:00:38] Hamas which means
[1:00:40] cruelty false
[1:00:43] Injustice
[1:00:46] oppressor
[1:00:48] unrighteous now if you take the the the
[1:00:50] the same
[1:00:52] word into the Arabic
[1:00:55] Hamas means brave and
[1:00:59] courageous well it depends on what side
[1:01:01] of the fence you're
[1:01:03] on that's whether you're seeing somebody
[1:01:05] Brave and
[1:01:07] courageous or if you're seeing an
[1:01:10] oppressor someone that brings
[1:01:13] violence now notice this now remember
[1:01:16] keep in
[1:01:17] mind God's purpose of revealing
[1:01:22] himself Ephesians 311 tells
[1:01:26] us according to the Eternal
[1:01:31] purpose which he purposed in Christ
[1:01:34] Jesus our
[1:01:36] lord then in Luke 218 he
[1:01:42] says take heed that ye be not
[1:01:46] deceived for many shall come in my name
[1:01:49] saying I am
[1:01:53] Christ I am the
[1:01:55] Messiah and the time draweth
[1:01:59] near go ye not therefore after
[1:02:03] them they're claiming
[1:02:06] now that Messiah is could be there in
[1:02:09] Israel
[1:02:11] already because there's a certain Rabbi
[1:02:14] who has they say has done certain
[1:02:15] Miracles
[1:02:17] right keep up with these
[1:02:23] things
[1:02:25] what do we do with our
[1:02:34] time we're a people prepared for a
[1:02:38] Rapture
[1:02:41] right my
[1:02:50] goodness when and what will it take
[1:02:55] for God to get our
[1:02:57] attention we have become so
[1:03:03] Earthbound so carnal in the way we think
[1:03:06] and the way we do
[1:03:08] things that we become million miles from
[1:03:12] where we need to
[1:03:15] be God have
[1:03:18] mercy anyways there's this there's a
[1:03:20] rabbi that they say he's done many
[1:03:23] miracles
[1:03:25] and they say this he could be the
[1:03:30] Messiah no no there are things that have
[1:03:34] to
[1:03:35] happen there are two prophets that need
[1:03:38] to come on the
[1:03:40] scene there's much more so when you try
[1:03:42] to put the card in front of the
[1:03:45] horse can it doesn't come out right
[1:03:48] because that's not the
[1:03:50] purpose there's a purpose where with
[1:03:53] Christ
[1:03:55] is what is who is revealing this unseen
[1:03:58] this invisible
[1:04:01] God and ye shall be betrayed verse
[1:04:04] 16 by betrayed both by parents and
[1:04:11] Brethren and kins folks and
[1:04:14] friends tell me it's not a
[1:04:16] day we are betrayed by
[1:04:23] friends yes
[1:04:27] amen we don't like to hear those
[1:04:30] things because we like to play two sides
[1:04:33] both sides of the
[1:04:35] fence you'll answer one of these
[1:04:39] days I'm not talking about taking sides
[1:04:41] with
[1:04:42] people you catch the spirits coming
[1:04:45] bouncing
[1:04:46] back oh he wants us to take side
[1:04:49] no you take sides with the
[1:04:53] word is the anointed word of the
[1:04:57] hour but the question is how have you
[1:05:01] answered what think he of
[1:05:06] Christ well we're going to get into
[1:05:08] something good here in a
[1:05:10] moment but there's so the atmospheres
[1:05:12] are so full of devils right
[1:05:15] now we got to clear out the atmosphere
[1:05:19] first you'll be betrayed by kin folks
[1:05:22] and friends and some of you shall they
[1:05:25] cause to be put to
[1:05:30] death and you shall be hated of all men
[1:05:33] for my name's
[1:05:36] sake oh brother that's that's
[1:05:39] Israel that's Israel in the
[1:05:41] natural remember Israel parallels the
[1:05:46] church but there shall not an hair of
[1:05:49] your head
[1:05:53] perish
[1:05:55] he just said some of you will be put to
[1:06:00] death and then he turns around and says
[1:06:02] but not a hair on your head will will
[1:06:08] perish could put to
[1:06:10] death get out of hair in your
[1:06:14] head watch this now in your patience
[1:06:19] though in your
[1:06:21] patience possess ye your
[1:06:25] Souls it's in your
[1:06:27] patience that you will save your
[1:06:31] soul this this scripture is
[1:06:35] tremendous there is no other
[1:06:38] nation that has ever been dispossessed
[1:06:41] of their native
[1:06:44] land and still maintain their
[1:06:48] identity no other no other nation has
[1:06:52] this ever happened to
[1:06:55] once again no other
[1:06:58] nation that has ever been dispossessed
[1:07:00] of their native
[1:07:03] land maintain their
[1:07:06] identity except
[1:07:09] Israel Jacob went off to
[1:07:13] Egypt and they returned during The
[1:07:17] Exodus then they were carried off to
[1:07:20] Babylon for 70
[1:07:22] years they get their land back during
[1:07:25] the times of the
[1:07:28] Persians then they were scattered
[1:07:30] throughout the world by the
[1:07:34] Romans and
[1:07:37] supernaturally trumpet
[1:07:39] sounded and they returned to their
[1:07:43] Homeland and still recognized as a
[1:07:48] nation with their own flag their own
[1:07:51] money their own language
[1:07:55] still with their own
[1:07:59] identity there's some theology out there
[1:08:02] that's called replacement
[1:08:07] theology that states that the Jew has
[1:08:09] completely passed off the scene of Bible
[1:08:14] prophecy passed off the
[1:08:17] scene of Bible
[1:08:19] prophecy and that anything in the Bible
[1:08:21] that's after the time of Christ
[1:08:25] it's only talking about spiritual
[1:08:28] Israel but watch what Paul has to say in
[1:08:32] Romans
[1:08:35] 11 verse 1-5 and then 25 I say then hath
[1:08:40] God Cast Away his
[1:08:44] people God
[1:08:45] forbid for I also am an Israelite of the
[1:08:49] Seed of
[1:08:50] Abraham The Tribe of Benjamin was go
[1:09:04] God hath not Cast Away his people which
[1:09:06] he
[1:09:07] forew watch ye not what the scripture
[1:09:10] saith of Elias how he maketh
[1:09:13] intercession to God against Israel
[1:09:22] saying
[1:09:29] Lord they have killed thy prophets and
[1:09:31] dig down thine altars and I am left
[1:09:33] alone and they seek my
[1:09:44] life but what saith the answer of God
[1:09:48] unto Elias or unto
[1:09:52] him
[1:09:55] I have reserved to
[1:09:57] myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the
[1:10:02] knee to the image of
[1:10:09] ba so then at this present
[1:10:14] time and I'm going to say at this
[1:10:16] present
[1:10:18] time there is a Remnant according to the
[1:10:21] election of Grace
[1:10:25] even though they're still under the
[1:10:28] law but Grace is coming to
[1:10:32] them the message of Grace that we have
[1:10:36] received that's in the
[1:10:39] purpose that's what God from before the
[1:10:42] foundation of the
[1:10:44] world he knew he would have a
[1:10:47] people no matter what they would go
[1:10:51] through he's telling you here even at
[1:10:53] this present
[1:10:55] time there is a
[1:10:58] Remnant according to the election of
[1:11:02] Grace watch 25 for I would not Brethren
[1:11:06] that ye should be ignorant of this
[1:11:10] mystery lest ye should be wise in your
[1:11:13] own
[1:11:18] conceits arant that blindness in part is
[1:11:22] happened to Israel
[1:11:27] until the fullness of the Gentiles be
[1:11:32] in you can see that Satan has always
[1:11:34] tried to eradicate God's
[1:11:38] people but praise God for
[1:11:43] Grace well well then they asked well
[1:11:45] brother Caleb what do you see in this
[1:11:47] conflict in this
[1:11:50] War I want you to hear closely so you
[1:11:53] can know what brother Caleb what I
[1:11:56] believe to me this war this conflict
[1:12:00] this war that's going
[1:12:03] on there's a purpose behind
[1:12:06] it and the
[1:12:09] purpose is to for them to open up their
[1:12:12] minds and their
[1:12:15] hearts so that they can ask or answer
[1:12:19] the
[1:12:22] question what think ye of
[1:12:27] Christ they have not been able to answer
[1:12:30] that
[1:12:32] question they did it and they said oh
[1:12:34] he's the son of son of of of
[1:12:37] Abraham or of David he's the son of
[1:12:41] David yeah they gave an
[1:12:44] answer but that answer was not
[1:12:48] correct it was partially
[1:12:51] correct because they were they they were
[1:12:53] blinded in
[1:12:56] part so according to the to the
[1:13:00] Natural they they said it right but they
[1:13:04] could not see farther than
[1:13:06] that that's where we're at we can see to
[1:13:10] a certain
[1:13:11] point and we just seem to we can't seem
[1:13:14] to see any farther than
[1:13:17] that listen listen to this
[1:13:20] closely pray that you get this now
[1:13:24] the purpose of
[1:13:26] this is because it is it is causing
[1:13:31] Israel notice how important this
[1:13:35] is it is causing them to ask the
[1:13:41] question what have we
[1:13:47] missed oh come on every one of us it
[1:13:51] makes me
[1:13:54] to look back in the scriptures and the
[1:13:55] message and say what did I
[1:14:00] miss I'm many of you ever stop and and
[1:14:02] ask yourself the
[1:14:03] question I missed something you got to
[1:14:06] you got to ask yourself
[1:14:08] constantly what did I
[1:14:11] miss something if if I continue to be
[1:14:14] sick and sick and sick I got to
[1:14:18] ask am I missing
[1:14:21] something come on chch you got to wake
[1:14:23] your yourself up H your conscience this
[1:14:26] morning ask the question have I missed
[1:14:30] something that's the purpose that I see
[1:14:32] of this
[1:14:35] war as the Gentile dispensation is
[1:14:38] coming to a
[1:14:41] close God doesn't deal with both at the
[1:14:44] same
[1:14:46] time so as it as as our dispensation is
[1:14:49] coming to an
[1:14:51] end he's beginning to turn back to the
[1:14:56] Jews then they have to be in the right
[1:14:59] frame of
[1:15:01] mind what think ye of
[1:15:03] Christ have we missed
[1:15:06] something is there something that we've
[1:15:09] overlooked notice this
[1:15:12] now what are we
[1:15:15] missing Nations and armies rising up
[1:15:18] against
[1:15:20] them to annihilate them we see the end
[1:15:24] of the Gentile dispensation quickly
[1:15:30] approaching but I will say
[1:15:33] this their
[1:15:36] salvation is in answering the
[1:15:45] question why are we going to look
[1:15:47] everywhere
[1:15:48] else brother what's going to
[1:15:50] happen they need to answer the question
[1:15:54] and every one of us need to answer the
[1:15:59] question what think ye of
[1:16:01] Christ I know Christ as Jesus Christ
[1:16:04] lived 2,000 years
[1:16:06] ago no no no what think ye of
[1:16:09] Christ because he's the same yesterday
[1:16:12] today and forever you might think of him
[1:16:16] as in
[1:16:19] yesterday but what do you think of him
[1:16:21] right now in your day
[1:16:24] come on Church B yourself what is he
[1:16:27] today ah let's find this
[1:16:31] out they cannot answer this
[1:16:34] question until two prophets arise arrive
[1:16:38] on the
[1:16:40] scene my neighbor was asking me the
[1:16:42] question couple days
[1:16:46] ago tell me what you see in
[1:16:48] this when I finished with
[1:16:51] him he just said
[1:16:53] forgive me the expression but this is
[1:16:55] what he
[1:16:56] said you just scare the hell out of me
[1:17:02] every and I said good that's what I'm
[1:17:04] trying to
[1:17:07] do that's where the world is at
[1:17:11] fearful but what is there to
[1:17:15] fear the only thing we should fear is
[1:17:17] that we're not
[1:17:20] ready we're stuck in our own mind
[1:17:24] our own concept of what we think the
[1:17:26] message
[1:17:27] is there is an eternal purpose behind it
[1:17:31] all I can't look at a
[1:17:34] war I can't look at at what's going on
[1:17:37] in with with this
[1:17:40] AI yeah artificial
[1:17:43] intelligence I can't see all the
[1:17:45] violence that's going
[1:17:46] on if I just look at
[1:17:49] that why I'm going to be a nervous in a
[1:17:52] nervous
[1:17:54] condition but when I look at it through
[1:17:58] the lenss of of the very
[1:18:03] purpose of what God had in his
[1:18:07] mind and it's now
[1:18:10] revealed oh it takes me to another level
[1:18:13] here we we we we can't stay living down
[1:18:17] here we got to come up a little
[1:18:20] higher we've got to understand and be
[1:18:23] aware of the Eternal
[1:18:27] purpose and the timing of all these
[1:18:31] things watch what is going
[1:18:34] on stop for a moment because if you
[1:18:37] don't follow this you're going to get
[1:18:41] bored that's the way we I have to tell
[1:18:45] people sometimes
[1:18:46] hey maybe I had to pass some some
[1:18:49] mirrors
[1:18:51] around
[1:18:53] that's
[1:18:56] right do you know how you look
[1:19:00] sometimes really do you know how you
[1:19:08] lookes you get more excited when you go
[1:19:10] to
[1:19:14] McDonald's get a Happy Meal Happy Meal W
[1:19:19] but you give life to people what do they
[1:19:21] do amen
[1:19:24] I don't feel like being
[1:19:27] here listen to this I I I pray that the
[1:19:30] Holy Spirit puts this all together for
[1:19:35] you it's very important to understand
[1:19:37] the the Eternal
[1:19:41] purpose notice what's going
[1:19:45] on I didn't ask the Lord to go to Norway
[1:19:48] or to go to Poland or to go to
[1:19:51] Africa but there was
[1:19:54] pool why was there a
[1:19:56] pool I don't know at first I was like
[1:19:58] what am I doing
[1:20:03] here what am I going just for that
[1:20:05] people oh look at the brother goes to
[1:20:07] all these
[1:20:09] countries if that's my
[1:20:12] purpose my goodness I missed it a
[1:20:15] million but I want them wherever we go I
[1:20:20] want
[1:20:21] them I want that wherever we
[1:20:24] go I want them to begin to see the
[1:20:27] Eternal
[1:20:30] purpose scriptures being
[1:20:33] fulfilled the message is being
[1:20:36] fulfilled what what is really going
[1:20:39] on the gospel is going back to the
[1:20:44] east I don't know why I was
[1:20:46] there until he begins to
[1:20:50] show the purpose why he's p pulling us
[1:20:54] there I I I am I am a a servant of the
[1:20:58] Lord I am a
[1:21:00] prisoner where he pulls me that's where
[1:21:03] I
[1:21:07] go civilization traveled with the
[1:21:11] Sun from the East to the
[1:21:13] West he says we're on the west coast
[1:21:17] now East and West has
[1:21:20] met can't go any further
[1:21:24] sin has traveled with
[1:21:27] civilization yet every thought of man is
[1:21:30] continually
[1:21:32] evil it's just like it was in the days
[1:21:34] of
[1:21:36] Noah and we've come back to that time
[1:21:39] yet
[1:21:41] again the Eastern people received the
[1:21:44] Holy Ghost
[1:21:47] first civilization always travels with
[1:21:50] the
[1:21:51] Sun and so has the gospel traveled with
[1:21:55] the
[1:21:57] Sun but now we are
[1:22:01] realizing there's no place to
[1:22:04] go except back to the
[1:22:09] east oh come on Church you got to get
[1:22:11] this now there's nowhere no nowhere else
[1:22:14] to
[1:22:14] go we went as far west as we could
[1:22:18] go now he's pushing us or calling us
[1:22:21] back
[1:22:24] oh the word has gone around the the
[1:22:27] globe but here's our
[1:22:30] pastor and he says yes the word has but
[1:22:35] what about the
[1:22:37] [Music]
[1:22:38] gospel because the gospel did not come
[1:22:41] in word
[1:22:43] only but in the power and the
[1:22:47] demonstration so then the word is
[1:22:50] there so many people don't know know
[1:22:52] what to do with the
[1:22:54] word so what what what needs to
[1:22:57] happen the gospel s got to sweep back to
[1:23:01] the
[1:23:02] east to get to get back
[1:23:05] where to the place it first
[1:23:09] fell in
[1:23:11] Jerusalem this is all a
[1:23:14] setup I'm telling you it's all a setup
[1:23:17] it's
[1:23:17] all everything that goes on it's the
[1:23:20] plan of
[1:23:21] God no notice this now how many are with
[1:23:25] me once again while the Pharisees were
[1:23:28] gathered together he asked
[1:23:31] them what think you of Christ whose son
[1:23:34] is
[1:23:36] he he saith unto
[1:23:38] them how then this is verse
[1:23:41] 43 how then do David in
[1:23:45] spirit
[1:23:47] Lord saying the Lord said unto my
[1:23:51] Lord sit thou on my right
[1:23:54] hand that's a hand of power or
[1:23:57] opposition of power till I make thine
[1:24:00] enemies thy foot
[1:24:03] stool if David then call him Lord how is
[1:24:07] he his
[1:24:09] son how is a father GNA tell his son my
[1:24:14] Lord capital
[1:24:21] L that doesn't even seem
[1:24:24] possible and he's telling them how if
[1:24:27] David called him Lord how is he his
[1:24:31] son and no man was able to answer him a
[1:24:37] word neither D any man from that day
[1:24:40] forth ask him any more
[1:24:44] questions just by asking them one
[1:24:48] question what think he of
[1:24:50] Christ we have our our hands full with
[1:24:53] this subject
[1:24:54] now I'm going to get into this to this
[1:24:57] subject
[1:24:58] now what think he of Christ ask yourself
[1:25:01] right
[1:25:02] now what think you of
[1:25:04] Christ and we better be able to answer
[1:25:07] this
[1:25:09] question because our Salvation is in
[1:25:12] this
[1:25:16] question oh come on I got to tell you
[1:25:19] again our salvation
[1:25:23] is in this
[1:25:30] question we can say a lot of
[1:25:34] things but our
[1:25:36] lives our
[1:25:38] actions our
[1:25:39] speech tell the real story of what we
[1:25:42] really think of
[1:25:46] Christ I'm getting to something now I'm
[1:25:48] I'm just I just just putting a
[1:25:50] foundation here
[1:25:53] if Jesus
[1:25:54] Christ the God
[1:25:57] man that lived 2,000 years
[1:26:00] ago was standing right next to you right
[1:26:05] now right at this very moment he was
[1:26:08] sitting next to
[1:26:11] you would you act any different than
[1:26:13] what you're acting right
[1:26:15] now on now what do you think of
[1:26:19] Christ it tells what you think
[1:26:22] when we come to
[1:26:29] church look at
[1:26:33] them see who else I can talk
[1:26:38] about you you haven't answered the
[1:26:43] question what think you of
[1:26:47] Christ would you act different right now
[1:26:49] if he was sitting right next to you
[1:26:53] the question is for every one of
[1:26:55] you would you worship any
[1:26:59] different if you knew that he was
[1:27:01] standing next to
[1:27:05] you oh come on come on
[1:27:08] church this is what I'm talking
[1:27:10] about Christ is simply a fairy
[1:27:15] tale simply someone that lives way out
[1:27:18] in there way out somewhere in
[1:27:21] space it's someone that we are not
[1:27:25] conscious of the presence of the Lord in
[1:27:28] our
[1:27:29] midst that's why we we freak out with
[1:27:32] everything that's going
[1:27:33] on we don't need to freak out no more we
[1:27:37] need to become
[1:27:39] conscious that Christ is the
[1:27:43] mystery of God
[1:27:45] revealed and I can
[1:27:48] answer whose son is
[1:27:51] he a I got to answer and every one of us
[1:27:54] has to answer this
[1:27:57] question how would you
[1:28:00] talk standing right next to
[1:28:04] you that
[1:28:09] brother it would be an instant
[1:28:15] stop I don't like
[1:28:20] that that's right
[1:28:23] amen amen yes sir would we would we be
[1:28:26] nervous if he was standing next to
[1:28:33] you would we be
[1:28:35] sick if he was next to
[1:28:39] us come on church it's just the
[1:28:42] realities of this
[1:28:43] now I I I'm so done with with it's it's
[1:28:47] just like he's far
[1:28:49] away and we preach and we preach and
[1:28:53] wonderful messages everything good I'm
[1:28:56] not I'm not throwing
[1:28:57] against but but I I I need more right
[1:29:00] now we need more than than what we have
[1:29:03] seen what we what we
[1:29:06] know we already have the
[1:29:09] mechanics we have the
[1:29:12] theology we can tell you everything that
[1:29:14] the messenger
[1:29:16] says but we need the Dynamics
[1:29:19] now we need the Dynamics
[1:29:22] to take the
[1:29:24] mechanics and make those mechanics do
[1:29:27] something that it says it will
[1:29:31] do we have not recognized that we are
[1:29:34] the Temple of the
[1:29:38] Dynamics
[1:29:43] Hallelujah and our
[1:29:46] children and all we do is yes
[1:29:50] yes
[1:29:53] the problem is is that the question
[1:29:55] hasn't been
[1:29:59] answered
[1:30:01] Christ
[1:30:03] amen oh this this message won't make me
[1:30:09] popular I don't really
[1:30:11] care I'm not trying to be
[1:30:14] popular as the pastor I have a
[1:30:16] responsibility to get you prepared for
[1:30:19] the
[1:30:20] rapture
[1:30:24] if you went home after
[1:30:27] service and you knew he was in the car
[1:30:29] with
[1:30:32] you and you got
[1:30:34] home would you change your routine of
[1:30:38] the things that you
[1:30:42] do would you or not yeah I'm going home
[1:30:47] get
[1:30:48] food back back and
[1:30:52] and then I don't know go off and see
[1:30:55] somebody and see what I can find out do
[1:30:58] would you change your
[1:31:02] routine would you still
[1:31:05] visit the same sites on your phone if he
[1:31:08] was standing
[1:31:12] [Music]
[1:31:20] next would you TR try and fight off
[1:31:22] those bad
[1:31:25] thoughts or would you allow them to
[1:31:27] dominate
[1:31:29] you if he was standing next to
[1:31:34] you come on my subtitle is we have found
[1:31:38] the
[1:31:44] Messiah get to something
[1:31:48] here you were sick would you ask him to
[1:31:50] heal you
[1:31:53] or would you go to the medicine
[1:32:00] cabin would you talk with him if he was
[1:32:03] standing next to
[1:32:05] you so that you could know more about
[1:32:14] him if you had that opportunity what
[1:32:16] would you
[1:32:17] do what would you do with
[1:32:20] it
[1:32:22] would you want to know what he thinks
[1:32:24] about
[1:32:28] you what would you
[1:32:30] do could you answer the
[1:32:33] question what thinking of
[1:32:37] Christ sadly most people would continue
[1:32:40] acting and living the same
[1:32:45] way you know why because they would
[1:32:48] still not recognize that it was
[1:32:50] him
[1:32:56] come on the presence of the
[1:32:58] Lord not
[1:33:01] recognized we
[1:33:03] would because we'd say oh it's another
[1:33:07] brother God bless
[1:33:11] you that's why after four months after
[1:33:14] preaching the
[1:33:18] seals brother Brandon preaches the
[1:33:20] message Christ is the mystery of God
[1:33:25] revealed and in this
[1:33:28] message we find out such a vast
[1:33:31] understanding a vast revealing of of who
[1:33:34] God is who Christ
[1:33:41] is who he
[1:33:43] is and who Christ is and his bride and
[1:33:48] it's all laid
[1:33:50] out
[1:33:57] brother Shake
[1:34:00] Yourself come on nowen stay awake come
[1:34:05] on don't you don't have to look over
[1:34:07] there to see who I was talking
[1:34:09] to we we
[1:34:13] are let's see who that was for for lunch
[1:34:16] that we
[1:34:16] say he was napping there uhhuh yeah
[1:34:20] that's that's that's a about the size of
[1:34:22] what the way we
[1:34:24] are listen
[1:34:26] closely this little scripture brother
[1:34:29] brandom
[1:34:30] says what think you of
[1:34:33] Christ your
[1:34:35] decision on what that scripture
[1:34:40] ask that
[1:34:42] question will fill your
[1:34:50] eternal if I said nothing else I could
[1:34:52] walk off the stage right
[1:34:55] now that simple
[1:35:00] question it'll seal your Eternal
[1:35:08] destination I don't know if you're
[1:35:10] shocked or else you don't
[1:35:14] care maybe it's making you check
[1:35:18] yourself that simple question he says
[1:35:23] it might mean your

[1:36:56] mystery I realized I didn't understand
[1:36:59] what I thought I

[1:37:15] question he makes it in
[1:37:18] general but it's actually individually

[1:37:59] generation and then he goes on to
[1:38:01] say let's accept him as the Virgin born
[1:38:05] son of
[1:38:07] God build our hopes on nothing less than
[1:38:11] Jesus blood and

[1:39:19] this question

[1:39:25] the moment you go to bed at night and
[1:39:26] the moment you get up in the

[1:39:44] question you'll ever have in

[1:39:49] question it'll answer every question
[1:39:51] that ever comes
[1:39:53] up uh where did I come from what think
[1:39:57] you of
[1:39:58] Christ what am I doing
[1:40:01] here what think you of
[1:40:03] Christ where am I going what think you
[1:40:06] of
[1:40:07] Christ are you getting
[1:40:11] it you're acting like you're a deer in
[1:40:13] the
[1:40:19] Headlights
[1:40:21] what think you of Christ what a
[1:40:26] question even his enemies will tell you
[1:40:32] now what they think of
[1:40:36] Christ he says this if Judas if we could
[1:40:39] go down to the regions of the
[1:40:43] lost to this worrisome place called
[1:40:47] hell and you could call the deceiving
[1:40:50] spirits of Judas is scar it to the
[1:40:51] platform
[1:40:57] tonight and would say
[1:41:00] Judas what think you of
[1:41:03] Christ I could imagine you could hear 30
[1:41:06] pieces of silver rattle across the
[1:41:12] platform and he would say I have
[1:41:15] betrayed innocent
[1:41:18] blood what if I could go to the
[1:41:20] smoldering regions of the
[1:41:24] Lost no I could go to the smoldering
[1:41:26] regions of
[1:41:29] the and called the Roman
[1:41:33] soldier who took the spear and pushed it
[1:41:35] into his
[1:41:37] heart and I would say what think ye of
[1:41:41] Christ whose son is
[1:41:44] he he would say truly that is the son of
[1:41:49] God
[1:41:52] when Christ was placed before Pontius
[1:41:57] pilot he had to make a decision of what
[1:42:00] he thought of
[1:42:02] him and my brother and
[1:42:04] sister Christ is placed before you
[1:42:09] tonight for you to give your
[1:42:12] opinion and make your
[1:42:15] decision what you think of him and your
[1:42:19] action will speak much louder than your
[1:42:25] words
[1:42:27] right I'm a Christian let me see your
[1:42:30] actions by your fruits you're
[1:42:33] known the first thing God wanted to
[1:42:37] reveal himself to the
[1:42:39] people he couldn't do it as Jehovah
[1:42:45] God so then comes forth from
[1:42:49] him
[1:42:51] something visible a
[1:42:54] light oh now now it's coming and we'll
[1:42:58] get into a lot of those things in our
[1:42:59] next
[1:43:02] one but I I I I just want to come to
[1:43:04] this
[1:43:06] now that and this is in the message
[1:43:08] Christ is the
[1:43:11] mystery goes on to
[1:43:14] say he wanted to be a loving father for
[1:43:17] he was a
[1:43:19] father and the only way he could do it
[1:43:21] was express it was to become a son a
[1:43:26] man that's why Jesus kept saying son of
[1:43:30] man see they didn't know what he was
[1:43:33] talking
[1:43:34] about many of them he said but now you
[1:43:38] get
[1:43:39] it they didn't know it back then but now
[1:43:42] you get
[1:43:43] it he wanted to express
[1:43:47] himself that was his one of his great
[1:43:50] three full
[1:43:53] purposes and so as we continue on he
[1:43:56] says now the logos that went out of
[1:43:59] God which was the
[1:44:01] logos all this began to form into a body
[1:44:06] shape and this body
[1:44:09] shape was
[1:44:11] called in the scholars
[1:44:14] teachings the
[1:44:16] logos Loos the logos that went out of
[1:44:19] God
[1:44:21] in other words a better word for
[1:44:23] it was what we call a
[1:44:28] theophany sir theophany is a human body
[1:44:31] that's
[1:44:34] glorified then he says well not exactly
[1:44:36] with flesh and blood like it will be in
[1:44:38] a glorified
[1:44:42] state but it is of a form of a human
[1:44:47] body that doesn't eat neither does it
[1:44:49] drink
[1:44:51] but it's a body that's waiting for
[1:44:55] us as soon as we leave this
[1:44:58] one now now we're barely beginning to
[1:45:00] see who Christ
[1:45:03] is not a third person of the
[1:45:07] Trinity but a furtherance of the of the
[1:45:12] unfolding of this great mystery of who
[1:45:15] God
[1:45:16] is finally man could have at least some
[1:45:20] idea of who he
[1:45:23] is so we know the scripture John
[1:45:27] 1: was the word the
[1:45:30] logos the word logos was with
[1:45:34] God and the Word was
[1:45:37] God and the Word was
[1:45:42] God and the word logos was made
[1:45:46] flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld
[1:45:51] his
[1:45:52] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[1:45:55] of the
[1:45:58] father full of grace and truth the Bible
[1:46:02] says he was the image of the invisible
[1:46:05] God Church don't let me lose you right
[1:46:08] now you can feel the spirit start to
[1:46:10] drift
[1:46:13] away your Eternal
[1:46:17] destination come on now
[1:46:21] we don't learn huh we don't
[1:46:23] learn we like never
[1:46:29] mind comes to
[1:46:31] Earth come a
[1:46:34] man name was Jesus that was his
[1:46:38] Tabernacle the Tabernacle of the
[1:46:40] invisible
[1:46:41] God and Christ means the anointed
[1:46:45] one now how many of you know
[1:46:49] Christ
[1:46:52] what do you think of
[1:46:54] him good thoughts or bad
[1:47:01] thoughts how often do you think about
[1:47:08] him I know sometimes service is so
[1:47:12] long brother Bram says you're just not
[1:47:15] in
[1:47:19] love
[1:47:22] when I was going out with my
[1:47:24] wife and I was in Colorado she was over
[1:47:28] here it didn't even matter if we said
[1:47:31] anything I just like to hear oh just
[1:47:34] just her breath on the
[1:47:37] phone I was in
[1:47:43] love oh next time you complain about
[1:47:46] church you need to ask yourself the
[1:47:48] question am I in love with him or not
[1:47:53] where else are you going to
[1:48:00] go
[1:48:02] Christ is the principal theme of the
[1:48:05] entire
[1:48:08] Bible we got to know
[1:48:10] this if you read the
[1:48:12] Bible and don't see Christ in every
[1:48:17] scripture go back and read it again
[1:48:21] because you missed
[1:48:22] something come on now this is this is
[1:48:25] it's what I said earlier of
[1:48:27] Israel it's making them think have we
[1:48:30] missed
[1:48:32] something if you read the Bible and you
[1:48:34] and you and you don't see him in every
[1:48:38] scripture you miss
[1:48:40] something the Bible is
[1:48:43] Christ he is the
[1:48:45] word he was in the
[1:48:48] prophets he was in the Psalms
[1:48:51] he was in the history of the
[1:48:53] Bible the Bible is a prophetic
[1:48:56] book it's a historical book it's a book
[1:49:00] of love it's a book of
[1:49:03] songs it's a book of life and in there
[1:49:07] you find
[1:49:09] Christ come on now you haven't found him
[1:49:12] that he's telling you where to find
[1:49:16] him but you'll find the mechanics
[1:49:21] but once it comes inside of you you got
[1:49:23] to become the Temple of the
[1:49:27] Dynamics Dynamics is what makes the
[1:49:29] mechanics do what it's supposed to
[1:49:34] do he's the same yesterday today and
[1:49:38] forever he should
[1:49:40] be the Principal theme of our
[1:49:48] talking what think you of Christ
[1:49:51] he should be the Principal theme of our
[1:49:55] talking he should be the Principal theme
[1:49:58] of our
[1:50:00] thinking of our
[1:50:02] singing of our
[1:50:05] walks he should be the Principal theme
[1:50:07] of our
[1:50:09] life what think he of
[1:50:12] Christ once again our
[1:50:15] talking our thinking our singing it
[1:50:19] shows what we really think of
[1:50:22] Christ oh we're going to get into
[1:50:24] something good
[1:50:26] here the problem is and listen
[1:50:31] closely we may have an understanding of
[1:50:35] who Christ
[1:50:38] is but where we
[1:50:40] fail is that we lack the furtherance of
[1:50:45] the revelation of
[1:50:49] Christ
[1:50:50] how many of you ever heard M how many of
[1:50:52] you ever heard the message that our
[1:50:53] founding pastor
[1:50:57] preached what of Adam's
[1:51:01] Rib what of Adam's
[1:51:05] Rib what about that rib of
[1:51:09] Adam oh come on now I'm talking about
[1:51:12] the furtherance of the of the revelation
[1:51:14] of
[1:51:15] Christ we know Jesus Christ of 2,000
[1:51:18] years ago
[1:51:20] now let me throw a curve at
[1:51:22] you is it just Christ is just that body
[1:51:25] that man 2,000 years
[1:51:30] ago brother brandom says Revelations
[1:51:34] 101 another Mighty
[1:51:37] Angel come down from
[1:51:39] heaven brother brandham says that's
[1:51:43] Christ okay now where are you
[1:51:45] at what are you thinking of Christ now
[1:51:48] huh that's right uh
[1:51:53] oh what think you of
[1:51:56] Christ I'm telling you we got to answer
[1:51:59] this question or we ain't going
[1:52:02] nowhere your action speaks louder than
[1:52:05] your
[1:52:07] words he should be the principle of
[1:52:10] everything in our
[1:52:13] life and when you answer the finally
[1:52:16] answer the
[1:52:18] question what think he of
[1:52:21] Christ then you can make the same
[1:52:23] declaration that Andrew
[1:52:26] made John 140 and
[1:52:32] 41 and one of the two which heard John
[1:52:35] speak and followed him was Andrew Simon
[1:52:37] Peter's
[1:52:45] brother he first findeth his own brother
[1:52:48] Simon
[1:52:51] and sayth unto
[1:52:53] him we have
[1:52:56] found the
[1:52:58] Messiah we have found the
[1:53:01] Messiah which is being
[1:53:05] interpreted the
[1:53:07] Christ now what think ye of
[1:53:13] Christ we have found
[1:53:15] him and his whole
[1:53:18] purpose was not to stand next to you to
[1:53:21] see what you're
[1:53:23] doing that was not the
[1:53:26] purpose it was to reveal himself in
[1:53:29] Christ and to have preeminence in his
[1:53:34] bride he's not going to just ride along
[1:53:38] in the seat next to you in your
[1:53:40] car he's not just going to sit next to
[1:53:43] you in
[1:53:44] church he wants to dwell inside of
[1:53:47] you so that you can answer the the
[1:53:51] question what think you of
[1:53:54] Christ for when Christ is in his
[1:53:57] throne we don't have to check and see
[1:54:00] what we're looking
[1:54:03] at no that stuff doesn't I don't care
[1:54:06] about that stuff I have nothing inside
[1:54:09] of me that's that's crying or or
[1:54:11] Desiring
[1:54:15] pornography is to please the
[1:54:18] groom what of me is to know
[1:54:23] him and to know what he thinks about
[1:54:26] me now I'm on the right track and when I
[1:54:29] get to church what think you of Christ
[1:54:33] first thing we do is raise our
[1:54:36] hands we clap our hands we sing the
[1:54:39] Psalms we read the scriptures why
[1:54:42] because he's the principal theme of
[1:54:44] everything in our
[1:54:47] Liv oh we have found found him
[1:54:51] Peter Peter was not the first one to say
[1:54:53] he was the
[1:54:56] Christ no Andrew beat him to
[1:55:00] it Andrew is the one that actually told
[1:55:03] him we have found the
[1:55:06] Messiah which being interpreted as
[1:55:10] Christ my question is how many of you
[1:55:12] can say we have found the
[1:55:18] Messiah
[1:55:21] no you all haven't found
[1:55:22] him well first of all you got to be
[1:55:25] looking for
[1:55:27] him every one of
[1:55:30] you that's why
[1:55:32] everybody's and and they have a
[1:55:34] boyfriend and I
[1:55:36] don't and he's got a
[1:55:40] girlfriend first the kingdom of
[1:55:44] God and all these other things will be
[1:55:46] added to
[1:55:48] you quit trying to add everything to
[1:55:52] yourself come on I'm going to say it
[1:55:54] again quit trying to add everything to
[1:55:58] yourself there's a triple
[1:56:01] purpose why God is doing what he's
[1:56:05] doing do you not think that he already
[1:56:07] has somebody for
[1:56:10] you why are we making wrong de bad
[1:56:14] decisions because we get try to get
[1:56:16] ahead of the
[1:56:18] plan we have found the
[1:56:21] Messiah we have found the
[1:56:24] Christ Colossians 1 127
[1:56:27] says to whom God would make known what
[1:56:31] is the riches of the glory of this
[1:56:33] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:56:36] Christ in you the hope of
[1:56:43] glory we have found the
[1:56:47] Messiah many of you have found the
[1:56:50] Messiah years ago you found him maybe
[1:56:53] years ago there are people here that
[1:56:55] have found the Messiah years
[1:56:58] ago and that's what we do is to
[1:57:01] preach tell you we have found
[1:57:06] him if they tell you he's in the
[1:57:09] desert don't believe him if they tell
[1:57:12] you he's in the secret chamber somewhere
[1:57:15] don't believe him we found
[1:57:18] him
[1:57:21] W I'm I can't finish but I'm I'm going
[1:57:25] to start winding down a little bit
[1:57:28] okay we have found
[1:57:31] him you know where I found
[1:57:34] him he's living in his body of Believers
[1:57:42] today that then outside of that you
[1:57:46] you'll never find
[1:57:48] him Oh either you believe me or you
[1:57:52] don't outside of that you're never going
[1:57:54] to find
[1:57:55] him he's not out there Christ in you is
[1:57:59] the hope of
[1:58:00] glory got the
[1:58:04] question you think of
[1:58:06] Christ he's awesome ask me what I think
[1:58:10] of Christ he Liv in my heart oh we talk
[1:58:14] every
[1:58:15] day oh Lord I go I go out running in the
[1:58:18] morning
[1:58:20] to the love of my life good morning my
[1:58:23] love I'm not talking to him way out
[1:58:26] there right here ah Lord we we've got
[1:58:30] these
[1:58:31] issues we need your help
[1:58:33] Lord so I'm asking you to come on the
[1:58:35] scene today we have our conversations
[1:58:38] I'm sure many of you do
[1:58:41] too but don't look any
[1:58:45] further that's why to many people they
[1:58:48] say they'll repeat brother Brandon and
[1:58:50] say oh the sickest body is the body of
[1:58:52] the Lord
[1:58:56] Jesus and and that's all we
[1:58:58] know sick
[1:59:00] body and I look at that and I'm
[1:59:05] like it's still the sickest
[1:59:10] body wow on it he said that 50 60 years
[1:59:16] later
[1:59:17] and the sickest body
[1:59:21] what do you mean by
[1:59:23] that is not there healing in that
[1:59:29] body I I I don't get
[1:59:32] it it's the
[1:59:34] members it's the
[1:59:37] people we're the sick
[1:59:40] ones because we cannot recognize or or
[1:59:43] discern the Lord's
[1:59:48] body but when when I looked at again and
[1:59:50] I and I read it
[1:59:52] again and it said the sickest
[1:59:56] body and I looked at that and it hit
[1:59:59] me I we were in Norway when it hit
[2:00:02] me he says is it still sick
[2:00:05] son and I looked at that and he says
[2:00:08] what does the word sick there
[2:00:11] mean and I looked it up and you know
[2:00:13] what it sick
[2:00:15] means it means that when you're love
[2:00:18] sick
[2:00:20] it means that there's a
[2:00:22] longing it's the sickest
[2:00:25] body in the sense that it's a there's a
[2:00:28] longing in
[2:00:29] us for all the members to come together
[2:00:33] now then it don't have to be
[2:00:37] sick now they can rise up as an army
[2:00:42] of but we're still with the same thing
[2:00:45] we're sick and we're sick and we're sick
[2:00:46] come on now you should be Desiring to
[2:00:49] have
[2:00:51] Fellowship come on why aren't we
[2:00:53] Desiring
[2:00:55] that because we don't ever get around
[2:00:56] each
[2:01:01] other we should be
[2:01:04] Lovick to get around each
[2:01:07] other I got my own
[2:01:12] people I don't have to go there because
[2:01:14] you know that you're
[2:01:16] wrong not that you have people that you
[2:01:18] like to finger
[2:01:21] out what I'm saying that is we don't
[2:01:24] ever make an
[2:01:26] effort we can always talk about the
[2:01:29] brother and the
[2:01:31] sister but when do we ever go
[2:01:34] in and visit those people that we talk
[2:01:39] about when do we ever do that is there
[2:01:42] not a
[2:01:43] longing oh no they can go you
[2:01:46] knowwhere you've never answered the
[2:01:48] question
[2:01:51] I'm going to say it again you've never
[2:01:52] answered the
[2:01:54] question come around the
[2:01:56] corner just we we'll have to stop
[2:01:58] somewhere
[2:02:00] because this this this this series is
[2:02:05] loaded we found the we found the
[2:02:12] Messiah he says here in the message of
[2:02:15] the
[2:02:17] Messiah his standing light is the light
[2:02:20] of
[2:02:27] Messiah risen
[2:02:29] Christ in his
[2:02:34] people the fance of the
[2:02:37] Revelation the anointed
[2:02:40] ones carrying forth his light into all
[2:02:44] the church
[2:02:46] AG sometime it almost completely goes
[2:02:48] out
[2:02:50] out and then he comes back
[2:02:53] again God's anointed
[2:02:56] one God's me Messiah
[2:03:00] Church Messiah means the anointed
[2:03:04] one it means king and then if the church
[2:03:08] is Anointed by the Messiah
[2:03:12] Spirit it becomes a lesser but still a
[2:03:17] messiah
[2:03:19] we know we know our founding Pastor he'
[2:03:21] say I don't believe in little
[2:03:24] christs
[2:03:26] right little
[2:03:28] CH do you ever know of a little part of
[2:03:32] Christ never seen a little part of
[2:03:35] Christ but I don't believe it's little
[2:03:37] in that
[2:03:39] sense I believe it's little in the sense
[2:03:41] that that each one is given a
[2:03:46] portion but when you get it all together
[2:03:50] ain't nothing little
[2:03:52] about she is
[2:03:55] him now let me get this now then if the
[2:03:58] church is Anointed by the Messiah
[2:04:00] Spirit it becomes a lesser but still a
[2:04:05] messiah because it has his light
[2:04:07] reflecting his
[2:04:09] power reflecting his glory reflecting
[2:04:11] his
[2:04:13] Dominion now we are the
[2:04:15] light if we are we reflect his Messiah
[2:04:20] light the Messiah sign
[2:04:24] follows the
[2:04:26] Messi the same as it followed the
[2:04:29] Messiah once again the Messiah
[2:04:33] sign follows the
[2:04:37] Messi the same as it followed the
[2:04:40] Messiah that's the way God's
[2:04:43] churches his Eagles or his
[2:04:47] eaglets his Messiah
[2:04:50] they look like
[2:04:51] him they act like him they preach like
[2:04:55] him they do the works that he
[2:04:58] did these are the
[2:05:01] Messi we have found the
[2:05:04] Messiah where'd you find him not way out
[2:05:10] there I found
[2:05:13] him I'm going to stop with
[2:05:17] this
[2:05:19] and it's a story that
[2:05:21] I that I came
[2:05:26] across and I pray that it
[2:05:29] uh pray that it blesses
[2:05:34] you I have your undivided attention just
[2:05:36] for five
[2:05:41] minutes I'll stop for
[2:05:47] now the story is
[2:05:51] this says that there was a monastery
[2:05:54] deep in the
[2:05:57] forest that these monks were so full of
[2:06:03] joy The Joy was
[2:06:06] contagious the people traveled from far
[2:06:08] and wide
[2:06:09] to to receive some of that
[2:06:15] Joy one day young man asked
[2:06:20] the
[2:06:21] Abbott which the Abbott is the head of
[2:06:23] the
[2:06:26] monastery why do people
[2:06:29] come he replied they come looking for an
[2:06:34] answer looking for answers to their
[2:06:37] questions such as what should I do with
[2:06:39] my
[2:06:41] life coming on pilgrimage
[2:06:46] pilgrimages how do I get the most out of
[2:06:48] life
[2:06:51] and as time
[2:06:53] passed things began to change
[2:06:58] there the older monks began to be a
[2:07:01] little
[2:07:05] cranky began to close their hearts off
[2:07:08] to God and each
[2:07:09] other hear close their hearts off to God
[2:07:13] and each
[2:07:15] other the very joy that attracted the
[2:07:18] VIS
[2:07:20] visitors was no longer
[2:07:23] there this is a process that goes
[2:07:26] through so many
[2:07:29] churches As Time passed fewer and fewer
[2:07:32] visitors came to
[2:07:34] visit no one came at
[2:07:38] all and one morning the
[2:07:40] head the Abbot was
[2:07:44] praying asking God to restore the place
[2:07:49] wonder what had gone
[2:07:51] wrong what had gone wrong with her with
[2:07:54] place that once was filled with
[2:07:57] joy when he felt impressed to go on a
[2:08:01] journey
[2:08:04] himself he went deeper into the
[2:08:09] woods to go see a friend of his that was
[2:08:12] the supposed to be the wisest man in the
[2:08:17] land when arrived
[2:08:19] he he simply said I need to ask you a
[2:08:25] question the hermit said not
[2:08:29] now follow me says that he took him to a
[2:08:33] lake and they stood there meditating for
[2:08:38] hours the lake was so
[2:08:42] still it was perfectly reflecting the
[2:08:46] Sun and after some time the hermit tells
[2:08:49] the
[2:08:52] Abbot he said you see the son is we can
[2:08:55] say is
[2:08:58] God the sun is
[2:09:00] God and the lake is
[2:09:03] you he said and as long as everything is
[2:09:08] still and there's
[2:09:10] peace we reflect God
[2:09:14] perfectly he said but throughout the day
[2:09:19] the winds begin to
[2:09:21] blow he said and all of a sudden with
[2:09:24] all the ripples he
[2:09:26] says it doesn't reflect the sun like it
[2:09:28] used
[2:09:30] to he said so it is with us in our
[2:09:34] soul and all is well and there is peace
[2:09:37] we reflect
[2:09:39] God but when troubles and Trials
[2:09:42] Come is where we have the
[2:09:45] problem and as he returned back he said
[2:09:48] let's go back to my my
[2:09:51] place ask me your
[2:09:54] questions the ab began what wisdom do
[2:09:57] you have for us his first
[2:10:01] question and how do we rejuvenate the
[2:10:06] monastery and how can we best serve the
[2:10:08] people who come to
[2:10:12] visit the hermit
[2:10:14] said I will answer your three questions
[2:10:17] with one answer
[2:10:20] go back and tell the Brethren
[2:10:25] this as the Abbot returned back to the
[2:10:29] monastery he gathered all the monks
[2:10:32] together and he says I have heard from
[2:10:34] the from the her the The
[2:10:37] Hermit and I have something to tell you
[2:10:41] I've asked the three
[2:10:43] questions he gave me an answer that
[2:10:45] answered all of
[2:10:47] them could possibly be they all
[2:10:51] said what answer could give be the
[2:10:54] answer for all the
[2:10:58] questions simply said this he told me to
[2:11:01] come back and tell you
[2:11:03] brothers that Messiah is among
[2:11:08] you think about this just tell them that
[2:11:12] Messiah is among
[2:11:15] them for one moment they looked at each
[2:11:19] other
[2:11:20] differently they thought of each other
[2:11:24] differently they began to treat each
[2:11:26] other
[2:11:28] differently the Brethren wondered day
[2:11:30] and
[2:11:32] night who is this Messiah that that is
[2:11:35] amongst
[2:11:37] us was it brother
[2:11:39] Adrian
[2:11:42] Bartholomew they wondered but as they
[2:11:45] wondered they began to treat each other
[2:11:47] with a renewed
[2:11:50] kindness and now a profound
[2:11:54] respect things began to
[2:11:57] change there was a new spirit of
[2:12:01] cooperation they encouraged one
[2:12:05] another compassion and forgiveness
[2:12:08] returned to their
[2:12:11] hearts and they were kind to one
[2:12:14] another and they spoke well of one
[2:12:16] another knew life was breathed to the
[2:12:22] community and before they knew it the
[2:12:24] visitors began to
[2:12:28] return one afternoon as the Abbot was
[2:12:30] sitting on a
[2:12:33] bench a woman approached him and
[2:12:36] says what happened here this place has
[2:12:40] been completely
[2:12:42] transformed he said it wasn't or isn't
[2:12:45] the place that was
[2:12:47] transformed it isn't the
[2:12:50] place it was the brothers that were
[2:12:54] transformed how did it
[2:12:56] happen we started Living as if the
[2:12:59] Messiah was amongst
[2:13:03] us she began to tell her tell him her
[2:13:07] problems struggles and she asked him
[2:13:10] what advice can you give
[2:13:13] me he looked at her and gave her these
[2:13:16] words of wisdom
[2:13:19] from now
[2:13:21] on treat every
[2:13:23] person that you ever meet like the
[2:13:27] second coming of Jesus in

[2:58:19] I got to before we
[2:58:22] go uh I I I I I want to read a
[2:58:30] Thanksgiving after a seven-year battle
[2:58:33] after sustaining an injury in my
[2:58:42] tooth it was was finally pronounced
[2:58:46] dead this Wednesday I was scheduled to
[2:58:49] get it
[2:58:53] removed I had done all to
[2:58:57] stand and was willing to take God at his
[2:59:03] word even though it seemed I had come to
[2:59:06] the end of this
[2:59:11] battle nonetheless I kept believing his
[2:59:16] word and believing that I am
[2:59:20] one who would know their God and do
[2:59:28] exploits I had been scheduled that day
[2:59:31] to have an extensive
[2:59:36] procedure but before the doctor
[2:59:40] started I told the doctor that I was
[2:59:43] seeking
[2:59:45] shalom shalom and and that I wanted him
[2:59:49] to First retest the dead
[2:59:55] tooth and repeat the
[2:59:59] X-rays at first it seemed the machine
[3:00:02] wasn't
[3:00:05] working so he asked for
[3:00:08] another when he finally
[3:00:12] finished he found just the complete
[3:00:16] opposite a resurrected
[3:00:20] tooth that could
[3:00:22] feel and that had no in signs of
[3:00:26] infection he stopped all the
[3:00:30] procedure and told us he would never
[3:00:33] take a good living tooth
[3:00:38] out he was in
[3:00:40] shock and a bit in
[3:00:42] fear that he almost took it
[3:00:46] out but Tim and I were in
[3:00:51] awe and raptured into Heavenly
[3:00:56] places of
[3:00:59] bliss an eternal
[3:01:02] gratitude to see the supernatural hand
[3:01:05] of God on the
[3:01:08] scene all glory and honor to my
[3:01:11] beautiful
[3:01:12] savior
[3:01:15] for having mercy on
[3:01:16] me and as a testimony to my
[3:01:20] doctor and his
[3:01:23] staff who all witnessed the
[3:01:27] supernatural but the people that do know
[3:01:30] their
[3:01:31] God shall be
[3:01:34] strong and do
[3:01:36] exploits Daniel
