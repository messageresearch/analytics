[52:15] mabel in my name

[52:46] david's men traveled to carmel then and
[52:48] there they found
[52:49] nabel in his fine pressed purple robe
[52:53] drinking wine and while acting like
[52:56] naval
[52:57] able sir i bring greetings from my lord
[53:00] david
[53:01] the anointed servant of the almighty god

[53:11] that you're having this
[53:12] chief chilling contest he wants to know

[53:19] taking care of all your shepherds while
[53:21] they're out with their flocks
[53:23] he's made sure their possessions are
[53:24] safe david has asked if you could send
[53:27] us back with some food
[53:29] it's been a couple days now we only had
[53:32] one birth to eat
[53:34] we're starving

[53:45] the david hey david who is david and who
[53:48] is
[53:48] the son of jesse better yet
[53:52] who are you bunch of fools with your
[53:54] crusty sandals on my nice clean floors
[53:58] how do i know you're not so cool again
[54:00] pretending to be with david
[54:02] i'm not giving you fools or crumb so you
[54:05] can tell david
[54:06] to eat dirt for all i care blasphemy
[54:15] and with the sad heart the men delivered
[54:18] the news to david
[54:21] my lord we're so sorry
[54:24] neville was so wicked and mean he said
[54:27] that we had crusty sandals
[54:30] he claimed that he did not even know you
[54:32] and that he could care less if we starve
[54:34] to death out here
[54:36] he said what yes lord

[54:43] this man will find out who david the son
[54:45] of jesse
[54:46] is he's a dead man yeah thank you sir
[54:53] david girded his sword and left the camp
[54:56] with 400 men following him
[54:58] meanwhile back in carmel avio had no
[55:01] idea
[55:01] of the great danger her husband had
[55:03] gotten them all into
[55:07] abigail abigail please
[55:10] you must talk to your husband what is
[55:13] going
[55:13] on oh abigail david the anointed sent
[55:17] messengers
[55:18] from the village to greet our master
[55:20] what do you refuse to hear them
[55:22] he doesn't understand david and his man
[55:25] have been
[55:26] a great wall of protection for our
[55:27] people he's so foolish he doesn't want
[55:30] to help him
[55:42] when abigail heard the words of the
[55:44] young man she quickly gathered 200
[55:46] loaves of bread
[55:48] two bottles of wine five dressed sheep
[55:51] four quarts of roasted grain 100
[55:54] clusters
[55:56] of grain and 200 fig cakes she loaded
[55:59] all the supplies
[56:00] into her donkey and quickly snuck out of
[56:02] the city without telling her husband
[56:04] nabel
[56:06] as she rode deeper into the wilderness
[56:08] she could see david and his men
[56:10] and they were coming straight towards
[56:11] her but abigail stood bravely
[56:13] as they approached her
[56:19] where is this man nabel after all we
[56:22] have done for this fallow
[56:24] and this is how he repays me all i
[56:27] wanted was for my men to have a bite to
[56:29] eat and drink
[56:31] how dare he rebuke the man that i sent
[56:33] in my name
[56:34] because he did not help me he didn't
[56:37] help my man
[56:39] and now there won't be a man or boy or
[56:42] even a servant of his that will not pay
[56:44] for his foolishness
[56:46] please let me explain my lord pay no
[56:49] attention to nabel
[56:51] he is exactly what his name means
[56:54] just a fool please accept this food and
[56:57] share it with all your men
[56:59] may the lord keep you from taking
[57:01] revenge and taking the lives of innocent
[57:04] people
[57:05] david i pray that the lord will deliver
[57:07] you from all your enemies and may all
[57:09] the people who tried to kill you
[57:11] be as naval i swear by the living lord

[57:48] him who sent

[57:52] from killing
[57:53] innocent people if you hadn't come so
[57:56] quickly
[57:57] all these families would have been
[57:58] killed by morning
[58:00] don't worry you may return home in peace
[58:03] i will do all you have asked
[58:08] when abigail returned home she found
[58:11] nabel
[58:12] very drunk so she waited until morning
[58:15] to tell him
[58:16] all that had happened with david nabal
[58:20] do you realize the danger that you put
[58:22] our entire family
[58:24] with the way you treated david and his
[58:26] men david is a man of god
[58:28] and deserves respect do you know that he
[58:31] was on his way to kill
[58:32] our entire house but god was merciful to
[58:36] us i want you to know that i gave david
