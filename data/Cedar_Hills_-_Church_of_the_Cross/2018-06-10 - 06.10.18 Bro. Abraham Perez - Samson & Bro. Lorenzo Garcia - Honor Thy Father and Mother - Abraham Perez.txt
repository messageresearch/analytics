[Music] like to like to thank you all for coming this evening and God bless all of you that are here internet hookup if you do please turn into judges the thirteenth chapter will be reading the first verse to the fifth and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years and there was a certain man of Zorah of the family of the Danites whose name was Manoah and his wife was barren and bare not and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren and Barriss not but not shall conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for a lo thou shall conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall began deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines at the word word the word of the Lord you may be seated we start with Samson when he's going to a town called Timnath where he meets this young lady you know get to know his name though but we know that she's a daughter of a Philistines but this woman does please Samson very well so Samson goes to his father and mother and he tells them if he can take this woman to be his wife but they tell him if he has any interest in any other girls and they're amongst their people but he does not so they go to Timnath to go meet the young lady while Samson as the Bible describes it goes down where he comes upon this young lion and he he ends up beating this line at battle cause lion attacked him Worthen we meet up with Samson again where he goes and goes to his new wife and goes and takes her but when he's walking he comes upon the lion and he sees that a foreign bees have gone to the corpse and then he sees that they had they made the sweetness stuff he gets it and he eats upon it and then of course it's honey where he gifts some to his father and mother and of course then we see Samson again at the wedding where they say that he has companions to be with there with with him where then he tells or then he tells the Philistines because the Philistines were there also he tells the Philistines I shall put forth a riddle and the riddle goes like this and if you do want to read the riddle of the riddle will be located in judges 14 14 and they say out of the eater come forth meat and out of the strong come forth sweetness the Philistines cannot cannot know the riddle they were confused of the riddle so days the Samson said if they get the riddle right then they get 30 yeah 30 garments and and cloth I think and cloth and if they win then he has to get them for him and if they win then they have to get it for him on the seventh day still the Philistines could not figure out the riddle so what they do is they go to the wife Samson's wife and they threaten her if they said they told her if she does not tell us the answer to the riddle then she and her then her father shall be burnt with fire so she goes up to pond Samson and she tells him Samson died has not loved me that I has hated me because of the I shall not tell me the answer to the riddle he tells her I have not even told my own family the answer to the riddle but he sees as she's weeping so he tells the answer to the riddle anyways so he goes meets up with the Philistines and the Philistines tell him because he tells them what is the answer to the riddle then he then they tell him what is stronger than a lion and what is sweeter than honey well then he finds out that his wife told them the answer of the riddle so what he does is that he goes out to go look for the cloths and garments thirty of them or then he stumbles upon this campsite where there he finds Philistines mistreating his people so what he does is that he kills them and takes their cloths and garments and then he gives and he goes back to visit his wife and give him the cloths and garments and then he finds out that his wife has given a has been given away to another companion or then he gets mad and grabs three hundred foxes and wraps sticks to there between their tails with fire and sends him back to the Philistines we felt where then burns everything then then the Philistines said how come how come is Samson treats us like this then they think to themselves then we should treat him the same way he's been treating us so they go and they kill his wife and his father they burnt them with fire were then he gets mad again and kills thousands of men with a jawbone of an ass were then he then he goes into hiding a harlot hides hides um this is where we find in Samson again because he goes to Gaza and he gets hide by a harlot because the gays i'ts wanted to kill him they said if they do not find him then they'll try to kill him by morning but the end of finding Samson and Samson takes off but to show him how powerful he is he takes the door of Gaza and takes it with him which frightens them all then this is where Samson stumbles upon a town this town was called Zurich where he met Delilah Delilah was not a very nice person as we all know the the Philistines promised her a lot of money can any of you figure out how much they promised her yes a thousand thirty shekels of silver 400 pieces of silver does anybody have another answer no it was 1,100 pieces of silver that they promised her each from the guard every guard each gave her 11 pieces of silver but not yet because she still had to find out what made Samson strong so she goes to Samson and she tells him Samson tell me I pray thee what is where does thy strength come from where is thy weakness from he tells her well if you wrap me around with this core that has not been dried then I shall be weak like any other man so she does that to him but where he finds where she says Samson the Philistines are upon thee and he gets up and he snaps it actually the Bible describes it like he snapped it like it was nothing so she gets mad at him at the next day and she tells him that has mocked me and told me lies she says Samson I tell thee and pray thee wonders thy weakness come from where does I strength come from he tells her if you wrap me around with the rope that has not that has been new that's new then he shall be weak like any other man so she does then she tossed Samson again Samson the Philistines are upon thee where he gets up and he snaps the ropes like its thread then she tells him again Samson that I has marked me and lied to me again where does I strengths and weakness come from so he tells her if you put these web and you put webs into my hair then I shall be weak like any other man she does that to him he gets up he just beats them all over again so then the next day she tells them Samson dye has marked me that has hated me has not loved me that has told me three lies what is thy weakness come from Samson and he sees that she's really mad so he tells it with all his heart when before I was born the angel came to my mother and told told her that there shall not be any razor upon my head that my hair shall not be shaved so she sees that he says that with all hers all his heart so she does she goes to the Philistines and tells them so the Philistines go there at night worse where Delilah makes Samson sleep on her on her lap and then she forces a man to shave off Samson's hair then she tossed Samson Samson Philistines are upon thee where he gets up and he tries to fight back but he cannot the Philistines take him down and they put out his eyes where he can no longer see so with Samson does as I he he goes he goes to Gaza they take him to Gaza where they put him in jail he cannot see so the guard takes him and takes him to the pillars but he tells the guard please leave me let me lean on the pillars for I cannot see so that's what he does and then he tells the Lord a prayer now does anybody know the prayer nobody he tells the Lord oh Lord do remember me one last time where there's a message that brother Branham that brother Branham preached which was called just one last time and the and he says lord please let me die with these Philistines because all the men and Philistines and women came to see Samson that day there was thousands of people there so what he does he gets to the pillars puts his two hands there and he pushes them which kills all of them including Samson like to thank you all for being a good audience god bless amen amen god bless you all brother eight god bless brother Abraham we got a we have a preacher amongst us huh he did pretty pretty awesome job would you agree amen amen abdicated are the children happy today yes can I hear an amen from y'all okay that that was that was a little weak okay I know you guys can do way better than that can we can I hear a Blau demon as loud as you can all righty all right it looks like you guys are happy I'm glad you guys are happy and I uh I was asked yesterday if I could speak to the children and I prayed and I prayed and I prayed yesterday and I said what could I tell what can I tell your children Lord what is it that I could tell him and the thought came to me of the 10 commandments and the commandment one second you hear me okay even better thanks so it was it was the commandment of honor thy father and thy mother how many know this commandment yeah okay I'm gonna need I need some help okay who's willing to help me today you're willing to help me okay I'm gonna ask you a question I'm gonna okay brother what what what do you think honor thy father and thy mother what what what is the word honor mean number one what does that mean what does it mean please dim okay good that's that's a good answer to obey that's a very good answer also how about any of the girls okay what is the word is honor mean to be obey and be respectful that's perfect to be respectful right it's too it's too to have the most the highest respect for them right and and I can i I want to be honest with you with you kids today okay I just I just wanna want to speak to you all from the bottom of my heart because one time I was your age okay and I was a little kid and playing around and I I have my mic I'm lucky to still have my dad and my mom still alive but if I'm being honest I there's been some times when I've been when I was a kid and I got mad at my parents I would get mad at them sometimes has any of any of you kids ever have you any of you kids ever gotten mad at your parents okay okay we're being honest right are we being honest okay raise your hand if you if you've been mad before at your parents yeah okay okay thank you for the honesty and I remember a few times yelling at my my mom I I yelled at my mom and I remember her slipper right right away she'd take out that slipper and just and just smack through that slipper right away but we need to honor honor our parents right why why would God I'm curious why would God even why would he even have us I would even have this as a commandment did anybody want to guess why God would have this as a commandment to live a better life okay and have more years of your life that's that's that yep that's right on with on track with the Bible that's that's awesome brother he put it in the tablets right yes that that's right anybody else okay that's it that's a good answer also so so I asked myself the question why I would God put this in in the commandments okay and we all we all honor our Lord Jesus Christ amen would you you guys honor God yeah okay I honor God too right and and and we have to understand that with our parents it doesn't matter if if your parents come to church or they don't come to church when it says honor thy father and thy mother it doesn't it doesn't give any any stupid it doesn't give anything it doesn't say because your parents are good or because your parents are bad or nothing it just says honor your father and your mother because that's who God chose to bring you into this world God chose them to bring you into this world and by them bringing you into this world you're here sitting down right now and you're so so privileged to be listening to what you heard this morning you heard our pastor preach and and he was giving words of life right you hear the message of the hour you hear the Prophet you hear the ministry you guys are so privileged you guys are so valuable to God that he gave you guys parents that he would want you to honor and and and love and take care of them now let me God God sent me God sent me today to give you guys a message okay and the message that that that he wants to give you today is that he understands you guys yeah I don't I don't know I mean you guys are kids and and sometimes we hear we hear some really really good messages and and sometimes they might be a little bit hard for us to understand right sometimes the the messages that come forth you're like it might go over our head sometimes but but God through our pastor has put children's service because he tell he's telling you that he understands you guys that he wants you he wants he understands you but in turn he wants you to understand him too and that's why he gave us a pasture that's why he gave us a prophet that's why he gave us the mess of the hour that's why we do what we do and and and and he loves you guys with all his heart now let me ask you a question maybe I I just I just want to be beyond like I'm saying I want to be honest with you guys okay maybe who doesn't have their parents here who doesn't maybe their parents don't come to church or brother okay maybe that maybe your parents don't come right ah if I'm being honest you know I didn't have my parents to come to church either okay I didn't have my parents come to church either but you know what God God still loves you and God still thinks of you as very very valuable okay now what are what are some things that we could do maybe two maybe we can help our parents maybe we could help our parents out it can I can I get some suggestions what could we do that to be good and help our parents can I get some could anybody help me with that pray for them that's that's a really really good one really really good one remember that brother Brown says you can do you can do too much of everything except pray so praying's very very good one okay really listen to the message yep that's another that's another very good one and any of the girls any ideas what you could do to help your parents anything at all no any more of the boys yeah yeah exactly because you kids went whether your parents come to church or they don't come to church remember that God lives inside of you guys okay Jesus lives inside of you guys in each and every one of you guys Jesus lives in you guys and you guys sometimes can be the model in your home or the example of what Jesus is now who wants to see some examples of Jesus you want to see some examples okay all right I'm gonna need some help though who wants to help me yeah okay I'm gonna ask can we give the kids a piece of paper please I got some helpers here and everybody's going to get one one piece of paper okay and I'm gonna I need somebody whether Abraham you look like my guy over there come on come on come on up here brother now here's some examples guys of what we could do to to be like Jesus okay to be like Jesus in our homes is weekend we want to do that we want to do the exact same thing that that he told us to do we want to actually do it right so back in the day who wants to know back in the days when Jesus walked the earth you know when you know what what would happen if you did something really bad and you sinned you know what would happen is that they would do something called they would stone you okay so that means they'd get some they would get a bunch of people and they'd get some really really big rocks and they would throw these rocks at the people that that did bad okay so I'm gonna ask brother Abraham if you don't mind if you can be the really bad person today come on it'll come right up here and I okay who wants okay let me see your paper hold your paper up everybody hold your
