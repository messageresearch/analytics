[35:37] both Cedar Hills Church of the Cross and
[35:39] Voice of Truth Tabernacle and all whose
[35:42] efforts are worth mentioning as far as
[35:44] this Milestone I'm about to talk is
[35:47] concerned I'm your brother in the Lord's
[35:49] Kingdom from northern Uganda brother
[35:51] opio Bazil who ever since 2017 to date
[35:56] has has been in close collaboration
[35:59] cooperation and sincerely participating
[36:01] in spiritual Awakenings that have
[36:04] involved majorly two of four mentioned
[36:06] churches with also brothers and sisters
[36:09] I can't
[36:10] identify I along with the people in
[36:13] Northern Uganda have it that from May
[36:16] 2017 when the team first came to discuss
[36:19] how to effectively translate the message
[36:21] of the hour and subsequent launch in
[36:24] December also held a convention and
[36:27] witnessed many tremendous things what I
[36:30] marked as the beginning of our trolly
[36:33] land being
[36:34] healed as the translation began along
[36:37] with the radio program it was like both
[36:39] an aerial and ground attack on the
[36:41] enemy's camp at that time we had 11
[36:44] message churches which had existed
[36:47] before where some were as early as
[36:51] 1986 then in a period of 6 years we now
[36:54] have 22 churches in operation
[36:58] these churches are spread in the
[36:59] districts of Gulu Noya and amuru which
[37:03] directly bord south the Sudan although
[37:06] districts like Amoro perer kitgum and L
[37:10] don't yet have message churches in them
[37:13] we believe if God's elected ones are
[37:15] there they will be reached we continue
[37:19] to appreciate and thank our Lord Jesus
[37:21] Christ for extending the ministry of
[37:24] Elijah by the hands of our brothers to
[37:26] our land and Country may God bless them
[37:31] shalom in our Northern office in Uganda
[37:34] brother Bazil and the team are
[37:35] translating the message into a chly
[37:38] since then we have translated 16 books

[37:44] mystery of God revealed and the
[37:46] exposition of the seven Church ages are
[37:48] in the works now we are currently

[40:48] verse 41 and
[40:54] 42 and it reads like this we should
[40:57] probably already know this by

[44:34] right we all we all we like love

[44:44] well not love stories that don't end
[44:47] well so once again pick up your Bible
[44:50] this is this is a love
[44:53] story now I'm going to ask you the
[44:55] question whose love story is
[44:58] it oh we are all right we are on the
[45:03] ball this morning I guess now they're
[45:04] awake
[45:06] huh now they're awake this is the story
[45:11] of it's my love
[45:14] story it's the Story of My Love Story
[45:16] with
[45:18] Christ am I talking to anyone else here
[45:22] this this is our love story
[45:26] we know how it
[45:28] started and we know how it's going to
[45:33] end I'm going to say it again we know
[45:36] how it
[45:37] started and we know how it's going to
[45:41] end when then as we understand
[45:45] this there was some things that I had
[45:48] gone through as I was hearing a message
[45:50] of our pastor founding
[45:54] pastor
[45:56] a message he had preached a series of
[45:58] messages back to
[46:03] Eden and uh he preached them in
[46:07] 1986 and in there he's he's talking
[46:10] about he's back at the Garden of
[46:15] Eden but he's he's talking about
[46:18] something that was lost from the
[46:23] beginning and that's something was
[46:25] friend
[46:28] ship church I got to be honest with you
[46:31] here is that I had never put this these
[46:35] things
[46:37] together but but it it was like a a
[46:40] light bulb went
[46:41] off and so I I I want to put
[46:45] here and I want to put it up here uh
[46:49] this is is what our founding Pastor he
[46:52] always taught us as the young people
[46:58] he would teach us the the seven steps of
[47:04] marriage everybody know what they are
[47:07] yeah okay if you don't you can write
[47:08] this
[47:09] down write this in your Bible write it
[47:12] write it wherever you need to write it
[47:14] but these were the seven stages or steps
[47:17] of
[47:20] marriage and so if we can together if we
[47:23] can you can help me out here some you
[47:26] are looking to want to advance in
[47:30] this
[47:34] stages all right so number one was
[47:37] what
[47:39] friendship every relationship must start
[47:42] with
[47:44] friendship we're in Sunday school so you
[47:46] bear with me as we as we go through
[47:49] this and after a a bond of
[47:54] friendship comes comes then
[47:58] courtship we've talked about that and
[48:00] and courtship is when you take the
[48:02] relationship to
[48:05] court what the verdict is going to be we
[48:08] heard that
[48:10] right what is what it's going to happen
[48:12] here is this relationship going to go
[48:15] forward or is it not going to go
[48:17] forward where where we
[48:19] at and then as far as courtship and
[48:24] friendship
[48:26] we know that you can still walk away
[48:28] anytime
[48:30] right it didn't work out nice dud and
[48:34] that's why you you don't the the man the
[48:37] young young man and the and the young
[48:39] lady they don't mess with each
[48:41] other there's no touching there's no
[48:44] kissing there's none of these
[48:46] things we teach
[48:50] that yes or yes young people you see
[48:54] Hess okay
[48:56] now now that that the reason for
[49:00] that is that if it doesn't work out you
[49:03] know that there's you're clean between
[49:06] the
[49:07] two nothing H nothing
[49:10] happened and you can always look at each
[49:12] other in the eye and say God bless
[49:14] you years later you get married to
[49:16] someone
[49:18] else you can always say God bless you
[49:20] Sister God bless you brother and there's
[49:22] nothing between you
[49:24] all right Christian way to do
[49:27] things but we also
[49:30] understand that when you go to the next
[49:33] stage the next stage which is
[49:37] engagement that once he asked her to
[49:40] marry
[49:42] him and and she says
[49:45] yes remember it is your vow one to
[49:48] another that bind
[49:51] you and at this stage you can't walk
[49:55] away no no
[49:56] more oh you could walk the world walks
[50:00] away can't walk away and be right with
[50:04] God and then we find then comes after
[50:07] that is the
[50:09] wedding after that's the wedding
[50:12] supper the
[50:14] honeymoon and the home
[50:16] life now in seeing these
[50:19] things you say well where does brother
[50:21] Bram say all these
[50:24] things all through the whole
[50:26] message amen not something we just made
[50:29] up you can find it through the whole
[50:33] message what really got me about
[50:36] this was that we we we all believe that
[50:39] we're going back to Eden right am I the
[50:43] only
[50:45] one we're going back to Eden
[50:49] right but we're not going back in a
[50:51] fallen
[50:54] condition are going back to a restored
[50:58] condition a restored
[51:01] Kingdom now now this is
[51:04] important because as we as we search the
[51:09] scriptures we find out that through the
[51:13] Scriptures it shows us the way
[51:17] back we thank God for a prophet that
[51:19] brought a message of
[51:23] restoration to restore us back to where
[51:27] we were in the
[51:30] beginning now then this this and and as
[51:34] this unfolds you'll understand where I'm
[51:36] going with
[51:39] this so before we can understand the
[51:42] restoration of the
[51:46] Kingdom he has to have preeminence in
[51:51] us and before he can have preeminence in
[51:54] US
[51:56] we have to understand how God first
[51:58] revealed himself in
[52:03] Christ so then everyone then has asked
[52:06] the
[52:08] question about
[52:11] restoration because we're get we get
[52:13] tired of this this old pest house
[52:17] right you know especially as you get
[52:20] older and as you get sick and and when
[52:24] everything is okay we're like oh no
[52:26] everything's
[52:28] good then all of a sudden somebody gets
[52:30] sick or struggles come and the family
[52:33] has had some
[52:36] hardships then we began to think
[52:39] wow what will it be
[52:42] like we want we desire a
[52:47] restoration so in Acts the first
[52:50] chapter and we're going to go we have a
[52:53] lot of verses to go through today
[52:56] but I want you to really get
[52:59] this when they therefore were come
[53:03] together they asked him saying
[53:06] Lord will thou at this time restore
[53:10] again the kingdom to
[53:16] Israel remember that's the third part of
[53:19] this to restore the
[53:22] kingdom will thou at this time restore
[53:25] again the kingdom to
[53:29] Israel will you restore the
[53:33] kingship the
[53:35] Dominion the rule the authority will you
[53:40] restore all these things at this
[53:44] time and he said unto them it is not for
[53:48] you to know the times or the
[53:54] seasons which the father ha put in his
[53:57] own
[53:59] power do you see they were asking a
[54:03] question that they were not ready to
[54:08] handle they they had not come to a point
[54:11] in their walk with the
[54:13] Lord that they could really comprehend
[54:16] the answer to
[54:19] this you see watch this they were asking
[54:22] this
[54:23] question before
[54:27] understanding that they had to be in a
[54:31] position to receive the revelation of
[54:35] it they had not been born again
[54:39] yet and Jesus had already
[54:42] said as he told
[54:44] Nicodemus unless you're born
[54:48] again you can't
[54:51] see nor can you enter the
[54:54] kingdom are you with me I want you to
[54:57] get this now once again so they're
[54:59] asking are you going to restore the
[55:01] kingdom unless you're born again you you
[55:05] cannot see or even enter the
[55:08] kingdom you're asking a question that
[55:11] you can't handle right
[55:14] now then they went to the upper
[55:18] room and there they received the Holy
[55:22] Ghost now their caral Minds were changed
[55:26] from a
[55:31] carnality now it was changed into a
[55:34] spiritual
[55:36] mind right isn't that what the Lord told
[55:40] Nicodemus that which is born of the
[55:42] flesh is
[55:44] flesh but that which is born of the
[55:46] spirit is
[55:48] Spirit carnal mind cannot comprehend
[55:51] spiritual
[55:54] things so so this being being the
[55:57] importance of
[55:59] it they also then they come to the point
[56:02] that they wanted to understand what this
[56:05] restoration of the kingdom
[56:09] was that's why I said this is my love
[56:13] story this is the story love story with
[56:17] him what do I think of
[56:19] Christ
[56:21] everything he's the world to me my life
[56:25] is my groom it's the love of my life
[56:27] what more can we say this
[56:29] morning so because I know this and
[56:33] because I see him in every scripture
[56:36] that I
[56:38] read then I know then I I begin to know
[56:41] who I
[56:43] am now the kingdom is starting to be
[56:46] restored to its rightful
[56:51] position notice this now what kingdom
[56:55] was to be
[56:57] restored we look in the Bible we find
[56:59] the kingdom of
[57:01] heaven we find the kingdom of God we
[57:05] find uh the kingdom uh well here with us
[57:09] a church
[57:11] Kingdom I'm talking about the
[57:14] world there's a church kingom right
[57:18] there's our own personal
[57:20] Kingdom am I talking to anybody here
[57:23] right no no
[57:26] we all have our own personal
[57:31] kingdoms Kingdom Ros you know it's it's
[57:37] sometimes I sometimes you wish you
[57:39] didn't know too
[57:43] much but it's very sad in this world
[57:46] that we live
[57:48] in it's sad
[57:50] because when you see most churches there
[57:54] they have have their own
[57:56] kingdom they have their own mentality
[57:59] what they're doing and why they're doing
[58:03] it that's why when when we in when we go
[58:07] to Africa and Poland or wherever the
[58:10] Lord leads
[58:12] us I always invite ministers from other
[58:17] churches that mean I see somebody come
[58:20] come with
[58:21] us and I do that on
[58:23] purpose the reason being is that is that
[58:26] we are not trying to build our own
[58:30] kingdom everybody understand brother
[58:32] Caleb isn't trying to build his own
[58:34] kingdom not at all no no we're we're
[58:38] trying to establish a
[58:41] kingdom in the hearts of the
[58:44] people and that's why I say come come
[58:47] with us this is not we're not building
[58:50] up something for for
[58:51] me or for our church we are building
[58:55] this up because this is the restoration
[58:57] of the
[58:59] Kingdom I believe that we are in the
[59:02] last part of
[59:04] this and it's so important that we do
[59:07] our
[59:09] part bringing the Believers bringing the
[59:12] people to
[59:16] Christ so I would say then imagine what
[59:19] we could do if we work
[59:23] together but you ask people you want to
[59:25] work
[59:27] together no no I'm I'm busy we got our
[59:30] own thing
[59:33] going God bless you in that God bless
[59:36] anyone that does anything for the
[59:39] Lord I believe that we're trying to
[59:42] accomplish something
[59:44] here and we have to understand then that
[59:47] that when we talk about the
[59:51] kingdom we got to know that it's the
[59:53] kingdom of God that is is being
[59:57] established now when we see the Old
[1:00:03] Testament and I don't know how long my
[1:00:06] voice will hold
[1:00:09] up but you bear with me
[1:00:15] today in the Old
[1:00:18] Testament it was known as the kingdom of
[1:00:23] God brother Bram tells us this it was
[1:00:27] known as the kingdom of
[1:00:28] God I pray that you catch
[1:00:31] this they knew about the kingdom of
[1:00:35] God for that was what the known church
[1:00:39] was called in the Old
[1:00:43] Testament the kingdom of God for it was
[1:00:47] God's
[1:00:50] kingdom God originally he wanted a
[1:00:53] family
[1:00:55] became
[1:00:56] Jehovah began to build his
[1:01:00] kingdom and his kingdom had to do with
[1:01:02] his
[1:01:04] family in other words God is the king of
[1:01:08] this
[1:01:10] Kingdom and the church is his
[1:01:15] domain I want you to tell your neighbor
[1:01:17] this God is the
[1:01:20] king his church is the
[1:01:23] domain
[1:01:25] now I I I want to express it this
[1:01:28] way as long as the children of Israel
[1:01:31] were were in
[1:01:35] Egypt they were the people of
[1:01:38] God yes or
[1:01:41] yes amen once again as long as the
[1:01:45] children of Israel were in
[1:01:49] Egypt whether it is Egypt is the is the
[1:01:52] world or whether it's denomination
[1:01:56] they were the people of
[1:01:57] God but the moment they came out of
[1:02:02] Egypt they were no longer the people of
[1:02:05] God they became known as the Church of
[1:02:10] God because the very Word Church
[1:02:15] means the called out ones
[1:02:20] amen then the king operated from above
[1:02:23] his people
[1:02:26] I hope that you get all these little
[1:02:28] points okay cuz because you're going to
[1:02:29] need them here in a little
[1:02:32] bit this King which is the
[1:02:36] king once again he operated above his
[1:02:41] people he watched over his
[1:02:46] people what they were doing right yeah
[1:02:49] he was God above us in a pillar of
[1:02:51] fire watching over his
[1:02:55] Kingdom wow he wasn't just then God or
[1:02:58] or his kingdom was wasn't just here on
[1:03:01] Earth
[1:03:03] no all Heavens were
[1:03:05] his the universe was his is his
[1:03:09] kingdom but he wanted to get a little
[1:03:11] closer to man we know these
[1:03:15] things Psalms 103:19
[1:03:20] says that the Lord hath prepared his
[1:03:23] throne in the
[1:03:27] heavens and his kingdom ruleth over
[1:03:33] all Psalms 145
[1:03:38] 11-13 they shall speak of the glory of
[1:03:41] thy
[1:03:42] kingdom and talk of thy
[1:03:47] power to make known to the sons of men
[1:03:50] his mighty
[1:03:53] Acts
[1:03:55] and the Glorious Majesty of his
[1:04:00] kingdom for thy kingdom is an
[1:04:02] everlasting
[1:04:05] Kingdom and thy Dominion endureth
[1:04:07] throughout all
[1:04:11] generations now that's the Old
[1:04:14] Testament we say Amen to this but there
[1:04:18] was coming a day
[1:04:20] Church listen closely there was coming a
[1:04:23] day
[1:04:25] when the King was going to
[1:04:30] Tabernacle in a human
[1:04:33] body and would bring his
[1:04:36] kingdom down to
[1:04:40] earth now do we now this is ABCs This is
[1:04:44] this is ABC's here but he was going to
[1:04:47] become one of
[1:04:49] us the king becoming one of
[1:04:53] us
[1:04:54] imagine now the kingdom of
[1:04:57] God had come to
[1:05:00] Earth tell your neighbor the kingdom of
[1:05:03] God had come to earth now we're we're
[1:05:07] talking about restoring the
[1:05:09] kingdom but who would have known
[1:05:12] this because all the people
[1:05:15] knew was that the God above us he was
[1:05:19] over
[1:05:20] everything but he was not close to us
[1:05:25] there was no
[1:05:27] relationship because the
[1:05:30] relationship the
[1:05:32] Friendship had been
[1:05:35] disconnected okay you understand this is
[1:05:38] why we feel the way we
[1:05:40] feel we we need more than what we
[1:05:44] have once
[1:05:46] again this is my love
[1:05:50] story all right tell your neighbor again
[1:05:53] this is I love
[1:05:55] story now how many of you really believe
[1:05:59] this we could say yes because we're in
[1:06:03] church but every day of our
[1:06:06] life is this our love
[1:06:09] story this is this is what Satan doesn't
[1:06:12] want he knows it's a love
[1:06:15] story but he doesn't want it to be your
[1:06:17] love
[1:06:19] story all right so so here we are now
[1:06:22] watch watch this
[1:06:25] unfold the kingdom of God had now come
[1:06:28] to
[1:06:30] Earth wait wait a minute I got to stop
[1:06:33] here because I got I want you to catch
[1:06:34] what the kingdom
[1:06:36] is it's the restoration of the
[1:06:40] Kingdom to its rightful
[1:06:44] position okay now now now you got to
[1:06:47] hold down to
[1:06:49] that God has a
[1:06:52] kingdom and it's he's the king over
[1:06:56] all but my question is are all these
[1:07:00] things his
[1:07:02] kingdom or is he the
[1:07:08] kingdom it includes everything I
[1:07:11] understand but I'm going to say it again
[1:07:14] the kingdom of God had come to
[1:07:20] Earth who had come to
[1:07:22] Earth God had come to
[1:07:25] earth once again the kingdom of God had
[1:07:29] come to
[1:07:31] Earth he had come to
[1:07:35] Earth there's nothing outside of
[1:07:38] him you're looking for a domain that is
[1:07:41] outside his of
[1:07:43] him he came to Earth he left everything
[1:07:47] else yeah in in one
[1:07:50] sense but in another sense it all came
[1:07:53] from forth from him so wherever he goes
[1:07:57] the kingdom is with
[1:08:00] him do that does that make sense to you
[1:08:03] all because I don't want to go any
[1:08:05] further if it doesn't make
[1:08:07] sense watch watch now once
[1:08:09] again everything that he has everything
[1:08:13] he is is always with him all the
[1:08:19] time that's right and if you don't
[1:08:21] understand that then you'll never
[1:08:23] understand understand what you have when
[1:08:25] you receive the Holy
[1:08:28] Ghost when we receive the Holy
[1:08:31] Ghost we receive the
[1:08:33] kingdom and everything that the kingdom
[1:08:37] has belongs to you and
[1:08:40] I come on now either we believe that or
[1:08:42] we don't I believe that because all that
[1:08:47] God was he poured into
[1:08:50] Christ and all that Christ was he poured
[1:08:53] into the
[1:08:55] church so what does the church
[1:08:57] have the church has it
[1:09:01] all okay watch watch where we're going
[1:09:03] with this now it had come to
[1:09:07] earth now Mark 1:14
[1:09:10] says after John was put in
[1:09:13] prison Jesus came into
[1:09:16] Galilee and he began to preach the
[1:09:18] gospel of the kingdom of
[1:09:21] God okay let's stop there for a moment
[1:09:26] what is the gospel of the kingdom of
[1:09:35] God somebody help me out
[1:09:39] here what is the gospel of the kingdom
[1:09:41] of
[1:09:42] God John was preaching
[1:09:47] that the kingdom is on its road to being
[1:09:52] restored
[1:09:54] what is John
[1:09:56] preaching we can go back and we can see
[1:09:58] he's preaching
[1:10:01] repentance but let's go a little further
[1:10:04] and let's see what what he was
[1:10:09] preaching and saying this is verse
[1:10:12] 15 the time is
[1:10:15] fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at
[1:10:21] hand that's what John was
[1:10:24] preaching the kingdom of God they're
[1:10:27] thinking way out in space
[1:10:30] somewhere the kingdom of God is at hand
[1:10:34] now as close to you as your hand is
[1:10:37] close
[1:10:38] to other words the kingdom of God is
[1:10:42] here wait a minute wait a minute the
[1:10:44] kingdom of
[1:10:45] God Heaven is my Throne Earth is my
[1:10:50] foot now it's that
[1:10:52] hand in other words words you're to be
[1:10:55] able to touch it
[1:10:57] now wait wait wait a minute you're going
[1:11:00] to be able to touch the kingdom of
[1:11:03] God absolutely
[1:11:06] that you're going to touch it
[1:11:09] now I'm going to say it one more time
[1:11:11] now you're going to be able to touch it
[1:11:14] that's John's
[1:11:16] gospel John is preaching that now the
[1:11:20] kingdom of God now it's touchable
[1:11:25] watch this now Luke
[1:11:29] 109 and heal the sick that are
[1:11:32] therein and and say unto them the
[1:11:36] kingdom of
[1:11:37] God is Come N unto

[1:12:04] nigh where is the kingdom
[1:12:07] today now we want to know where this out
[1:12:10] because because we have different
[1:12:12] people some haven't given their heart to
[1:12:15] the
[1:12:15] Lord others have but they can't go any
[1:12:20] further but it's time to go farther now
[1:12:25] once again it's time to go
[1:12:28] further we can't be happy just being

[1:13:34] me now notice this
[1:13:37] now they were looking for other
[1:13:40] things then Luke 17:20
[1:13:43] says and he was demanded of the
[1:13:48] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[1:13:52] come
[1:13:54] got stop here because these are so
[1:13:57] important here comes the Pharisees that

[1:15:51] God cometh not with with
[1:15:55] observation when is it
[1:15:58] coming when is it cominging God coming

[1:16:11] Jesus is looking at
[1:16:13] them and he is the
[1:16:18] kingdom oh come on now I'm going to say
[1:16:21] it again
[1:16:23] the kingdom of God had
[1:16:26] come and what was the rightful
[1:16:29] position he was in the office of
[1:16:31] son that was the rightful position at
[1:16:34] the
[1:16:35] moment but they couldn't see the
[1:16:38] kingdom because they were looking for
[1:16:41] Mansions they were looking for streets
[1:16:43] of
[1:16:44] gold Crystal
[1:16:47] pearls and they see a man that there was
[1:16:49] nothing to be
[1:16:52] desired
[1:16:54] he wasn't a very handsome
[1:16:57] man that probably if you saw him
[1:17:00] today probably be
[1:17:02] like that can't be
[1:17:06] him amen or amen amen amen come on now
[1:17:10] notice this is
[1:17:13] wonderful the kingdom of God doesn't
[1:17:15] come with
[1:17:17] observation neither shall they say low
[1:17:19] here or low
[1:17:22] there
[1:17:23] for the kingdom of God is within
[1:17:27] you now we're getting somewhere now the
[1:17:31] kingdom of God is not out there the
[1:17:34] kingdom of God is
[1:17:36] within how do you put all that
[1:17:40] within Jesus said Jesus said let not
[1:17:43] your hearts be
[1:17:45] troubled you believe in God you believe
[1:17:47] in the kingdom of God believe also in me
[1:17:51] for I am the kingdom of God

[1:19:05] God is within
[1:19:06] you I don't believe that he's telling
[1:19:08] the Pharisees that the kingdom of God is
[1:19:10] within
[1:19:13] them but I believe that he's telling
[1:19:16] them that they cannot observe this
[1:19:20] Kingdom because it's within the person
[1:19:26] the kingdom of God is within
[1:19:29] you how is it in me I want to know what
[1:19:33] the book

[1:20:34] kingdom is of
[1:20:37] righteousness of peace and
[1:20:40] joy it's okay to smile really even when
[1:20:44] you're going through a hard time it's
[1:20:45] okay to
[1:20:47] smile there should be joy in us all the
[1:20:50] time that don't mean we want to be
[1:20:52] laughing all the
[1:20:54] time Joy is one thing laughing is
[1:20:56] something
[1:21:00] else annoying
[1:21:03] huh here is something so beyond
[1:21:07] that I like the way it says it
[1:21:10] here and this is what this is what for
[1:21:12] the kingdom of God it is
[1:21:16] righteousness peace and joy in the Holy
[1:21:20] Ghost and they didn't
[1:21:23] recognize that the kingdom of God was
[1:21:26] right in front of
[1:21:29] them it's
[1:21:31] not
[1:21:34] that but seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:21:39] God and his
[1:21:42] righteousness okay he's got to have
[1:21:45] preeminence in you to be able to
[1:21:49] seek you can't him unless he has
[1:21:51] preeminence
[1:21:54] how many here does he have preeminence
[1:21:59] in that's that's an easy to raise your
[1:22:02] hand it's hard to
[1:22:05] live because we know the parts that we
[1:22:07] he doesn't have
[1:22:11] pre right see oh in church we are oh yes
[1:22:16] oh look at the
[1:22:18] brother got

[1:22:41] get it back back started
[1:22:45] here that's what they don't get seek
[1:22:48] first the kingdom of God not not second
[1:22:51] or third or fourth
[1:22:54] seek
[1:22:55] first there's where we fail we don't
[1:22:58] seek Him First seek him last we see what
[1:23:02] the doctor has to
[1:23:04] say we what the neighbor has to say and
[1:23:07] then at the end oh well we'll see what
[1:23:09] God has to say
[1:23:11] about that's not the
[1:23:13] kingdom in the Kingdom we are his
[1:23:17] subject and the first thing we know is
[1:23:19] what does God have to say about
[1:23:21] this we should live our life that way

[1:23:58] them verily I said to you that there be
[1:24:01] some of them that stand
[1:24:05] here which shall not taste of

[1:31:34] the kingdom of God that was Old
[1:31:40] Testament there had to be a
[1:31:44] transfer from the kingdom of
[1:31:47] God to even though it's
[1:31:50] included a different kingom
[1:31:52] it's the same in one sense but it's
[1:31:56] different in another now it's talking
[1:31:58] about you and
[1:31:59] I we are
[1:32:01] Gentiles we don't deserve nothing but he
[1:32:05] grafted Us
[1:32:07] in made us part of this
[1:32:10] Kingdom and now he's saying the kingdom
[1:32:13] of God cometh in
[1:32:17] power but Matthew 16:28 says verily I
[1:32:22] say unto you there be some standing
[1:32:27] here which shall not taste of
[1:32:30] death till they
[1:32:33] see wait a minut wait a minute wait a
[1:32:35] minute I got to stop here because
[1:32:36] there's a this is loaded right
[1:32:38] here9 some will not taste death until
[1:32:42] they
[1:32:43] see
[1:32:45] the kingdom of
[1:32:47] God come in
[1:32:50] power that's one thing
[1:32:52] but now in Matthew
[1:32:55] 16 some shall not taste
[1:32:58] death till they see the son of man
[1:33:01] coming in his
[1:33:05] kingdom now we're now we're getting
[1:33:07] somewhere now we belong to a
[1:33:11] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[1:33:15] God made spirit and
[1:33:19] life in our life
[1:33:23] how many get that now I'm going to say
[1:33:26] it again this is the
[1:33:28] kingdom the word of
[1:33:30] God made spirit and
[1:33:33] life in our own
[1:33:36] life that's when you know the kingdom
[1:33:38] has come into
[1:33:41] you until
[1:33:43] then it's just now
[1:33:47] you how many believe that that brother
[1:33:50] brother Noah has the whole Holy
[1:33:55] Ghost if brother Noah is close to
[1:33:59] me and I know he's got the Holy
[1:34:02] Ghost
[1:34:03] say kingdom of God is is
[1:34:09] mine come on now and then when I shake
[1:34:13] hands say kingdom of God is at
[1:34:17] hand but now God is on your hand what
[1:34:21] are you going to do with him what are
[1:34:23] you going to do with Christ on your
[1:34:26] hand put it in your
[1:34:28] heart it's not hard just put him in your
[1:34:32] heart the kingdom of God it's not just
[1:34:36] n not just that hand the kingdom of God
[1:34:40] is within
[1:34:42] you that's what
[1:34:44] we're that's the word that the word the
[1:34:48] life has now come into our life
[1:34:52] and now we are the subjects of that
[1:34:56] Kingdom everything that the kingdom
[1:34:59] has is in
[1:35:02] here I don't know if we believe that or
[1:35:05] not
[1:35:06] healing is in
[1:35:09] here if you don't got it then make sure
[1:35:13] that it's at
[1:35:15] hand so that someone can lay their
[1:35:18] hand on the sick and they'll recover
[1:35:24] I don't know just just just things
[1:35:26] aren't going
[1:35:27] right change in your
[1:35:30] atmosphere bring somebody close that has
[1:35:33] the Holy Ghost change the
[1:35:36] atmosphere say oh it's
[1:35:39] N I feel different how many times do we
[1:35:42] pray for people and they say brother I I
[1:35:44] feel
[1:35:46] different
[1:35:49] Chang what's so why don't we do
[1:35:52] that but then comes the moment that
[1:35:55] we are our
[1:36:00] thermometry and we go
[1:36:09] from that's right that's what we're
[1:36:11] after right okay so here we are now John
[1:36:16] 14 I'm gonna I'm going to skip this
[1:36:18] because I don't know where I'm at but
[1:36:20] this is
[1:36:22] but I want to get to there's some things
[1:36:24] I want to get
[1:36:25] to it's a transferring from one Kingdom
[1:36:28] to
[1:36:33] another once again in the Old Testament
[1:36:36] it was the
[1:36:38] kingdom of
[1:36:41] God but in the New
[1:36:45] Testament it was given another
[1:36:49] name somebody help me somebody not
[1:36:52] Minister I want to see the
[1:36:55] people somebody help me out
[1:36:59] here it's part of the
[1:37:02] same but it's more
[1:37:05] intense because the throne has
[1:37:07] moved are you with me the throne has
[1:37:11] moved it's not the throne isn't in
[1:37:13] heaven the thr is over a
[1:37:16] domain now the throne has
[1:37:19] moved to Jesus but now from Jesus
[1:37:24] where's his throne
[1:37:26] at okay brother BR says it gets more
[1:37:29] severe now why because the relationship
[1:37:32] gets more
[1:37:33] severe the relationship gets
[1:37:36] closer more than just nigh or at
[1:37:40] hand there is a Unity a
[1:37:43] joining a uniting time and
[1:37:46] sign that is bringing us and him
[1:37:50] together
[1:37:52] where you can't separate us from
[1:37:55] Christ okay okay watch this now he said
[1:37:58] but in the New Testament it's
[1:38:04] called
[1:38:10] Almost you never know he was been
[1:38:12] speaking in
[1:38:14] tongu nobody
[1:38:16] knows oh what kingdom are you supposed
[1:38:19] to be in kingdom of God yeah but come
[1:38:23] closer it was God above us God With Us
[1:38:27] now it's God in
[1:38:28] us Kingdom called for
[1:38:34] us I ain't even going to preach no
[1:38:37] more sit down here you want to sit down
[1:38:39] with
[1:38:41] me let them figure it
[1:38:47] out you get
[1:38:50] it
[1:38:53] what is it
[1:39:02] called very good finally thank
[1:39:05] you Min not being
[1:39:10] obedient well I said don't say anything
[1:39:12] let the people figure it out we give it
[1:39:14] everything to them they got to work at
[1:39:17] it
[1:39:18] too but watch this now in the New
[1:39:21] Testament it's called the Messianic
[1:39:25] Empire or the messiah's
[1:39:29] kingdom where Messiah
[1:39:32] rules where Messiah is
[1:39:35] King now we're in the New
[1:39:38] Testament now we're not looking back in
[1:39:40] the
[1:39:42] old now we're bringing it
[1:39:44] Clos what think ye of Christ oh he's the
[1:39:49] king of this Messiah
[1:39:51] messah
[1:39:55] Kingdom what do you think of Christ this
[1:39:59] morning it is known as the Messiah
[1:40:02] Empire or messiah's
[1:40:06] Kingdom and the only way to understand
[1:40:10] this you have to keep in mind that when
[1:40:14] Adam forfeited that title deed book of
[1:40:18] redemption it went back into the hands
[1:40:21] of
[1:40:22] God here we are the kingdom of God it
[1:40:25] went back to that
[1:40:29] Kingdom so God had a
[1:40:31] plan to take that title deed and give it
[1:40:36] back to man but it could only be
[1:40:39] transferred back to
[1:40:41] him through the messiah's
[1:40:44] kingdom he wasn't going to give it just
[1:40:46] to any
[1:40:48] man to be a man the man the god man that
[1:40:54] could take what was
[1:40:56] his and could bring it and restore it
[1:40:59] back to his
[1:41:02] children which children his
[1:41:06] bride he did it for you and
[1:41:08] I but there had to be one man do it no
[1:41:12] one else could do
[1:41:14] it
[1:41:16] Christ okay are you with me are you with
[1:41:20] some of you are looking at
[1:41:24] like go back and hear it
[1:41:27] again I
[1:41:29] got watch the
[1:41:32] transfer after this
[1:41:36] man Jesus said pray like
[1:41:39] this Our
[1:41:41] Father which art in
[1:41:45] heaven Hallowed be thy
[1:41:47] name thy kingdom come
[1:41:51] thy will be
[1:41:53] done on
[1:41:57] Earth is that what it
[1:41:59] says that's not what the scripture
[1:42:02] say that's what we're always looking
[1:42:05] we're looking for
[1:42:07] observation on earth oh I can see it wow
[1:42:11] what doesn't come with
[1:42:14] observation kingdom come thy will be
[1:42:19] done in earth Earth the Bible says in
[1:42:23] Earth as it is in heaven the way it is
[1:42:26] in that
[1:42:27] Kingdom it's also got a
[1:42:30] throne that Throne is in Earth not on
[1:42:34] Earth in Earth point to yourself in
[1:42:37] Earth this is where it's at thy kingdom
[1:42:40] come thy will be
[1:42:41] done in earth as it is in
[1:42:45] heaven God revealed in
[1:42:48] Christ for God was in Christ
[1:42:51] reconciling the world to
[1:42:54] himself the church is not an
[1:42:57] organization not a gathering of
[1:43:00] people the church is the people of
[1:43:03] God been called out of the
[1:43:06] world to serve in another
[1:43:10] kingdom we are living in a
[1:43:13] kingdom and it is called the Messianic
[1:43:17] Kingdom in other words where Messiah
[1:43:21] rules in every life that's in his
[1:43:26] domain you cannot be in that
[1:43:29] Kingdom he doesn't
[1:43:31] rule if he does not have a 100%
[1:43:36] ownership you're not in the
[1:43:39] Kingdom you may be
[1:43:41] n you may be at hand but it's time to
[1:43:44] make sure that we're in the
[1:43:47] Kingdom the prophet of God says oh we
[1:43:51] want
[1:43:52] Christ yeah we want him to save us from
[1:43:55] Hell
[1:43:59] Fire brother says but we don't accept
[1:44:02] him as
[1:44:05] Lord why we don't want him to tell us
[1:44:09] what to
[1:44:13] do he's the
[1:44:16] king and you don't want him to tell you
[1:44:18] what to
[1:44:19] do kingdom are you
[1:44:22] in uhoh uh oh come on now Church you got
[1:44:26] to be real with
[1:44:30] this I want him to tell me what to
[1:44:32] do because whenever he doesn't I make a
[1:44:36] big
[1:44:40] mess that's why I have to apologize and
[1:44:43] I have got to ask for
[1:44:45] forgiveness forgive me
[1:44:47] Lord when it's been me trying to be the
[1:44:53] Church brother Caleb's trying to Le the
[1:44:58] church
[1:45:00] boo but when the Holy
[1:45:03] Ghost the kingdom he dwells in and now
[1:45:08] through
[1:45:09] him using this vessel leading the church
[1:45:14] now we got everything in
[1:45:16] order that's the way he said he would
[1:45:19] set up his kingdom
[1:45:22] Upon This Rock of Revelation build my
[1:45:26] church and the gates of hell can't
[1:45:28] Prevail
[1:45:29] against because it's my
[1:45:32] kingdom nothing can come against his
[1:45:37] kingdom he is the king of kings and the
[1:45:39] Lord of
[1:45:41] lords how many of you

[1:46:16] know when we're going to think about
[1:46:17] starting but I think we should have
[1:46:18] started like yesterday year or years
[1:46:22] ago but start
[1:46:26] today it's so important
[1:46:29] Church watch as we continue with this
[1:46:32] Christ is the head of this Messianic
[1:46:36] Kingdom you can't organize it you can't
[1:46:39] denominate it it is Christ Kingdom and
[1:46:43] he is the
[1:46:45] head that's part of the love
[1:46:49] story
[1:46:52] if a man is leading the church we
[1:46:55] failed but if Christ is leading the
[1:46:58] church through that
[1:47:00] manic Kingdom In
[1:47:04] Action now therefore she is a called out
[1:47:09] group she is the mystical
[1:47:13] body Christ set it in
[1:47:16] order before he died he spoke of it com
[1:47:22] coming what is it

[1:48:12] see you won't have nothing to do with
[1:48:15] the kingdoms of this
[1:48:18] world they said Lord

[1:48:26] us J not as scary as says
[1:48:29] Lord how will you manifest yourself unto
[1:48:32] us and not unto the
[1:48:35] world Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:48:39] if a man love me he will keep my words
[1:48:43] and my father will love him and we will
[1:48:47] come unto
[1:48:48] him and make our abod with
[1:48:52] him there's a restored
[1:48:56] King there he is restored in the in a
[1:48:59] right
[1:49:02] position when will this when the
[1:49:04] subjects are restored the kingdom is
[1:49:09] restored a kingdom where you'll never
[1:49:13] die never be sick never have a
[1:49:18] heartache no more funeral
[1:49:21] no more
[1:49:22] Graves never again to be
[1:49:25] weary no
[1:49:28] depression
[1:49:30] sadness what a kingdom why wouldn't we
[1:49:33] want to
[1:49:34] go because the cares of this
[1:49:39] world we are to live in this
[1:49:42] Kingdom a kingdom where
[1:49:45] decency Holiness and power exist what a
[1:49:52] kingdom who's part of that
[1:49:54] Kingdom I'm part of that kingom I
[1:49:57] believe it believe that we are part of
[1:49:59] that
[1:50:00] King that is the
[1:50:02] promise the promised land is to
[1:50:07] live in this land of the Holy
[1:50:11] Ghost that's good
[1:50:14] stuff God's promise for the
[1:50:17] church to live in the power of the
[1:50:19] spirit
[1:50:22] another
[1:50:25] world it's another
[1:50:27] land it's another
[1:50:33] kingdom we can
[1:50:36] say look at brother
[1:50:39] Moses he goes to
[1:50:42] school and you help me brother mes he
[1:50:45] goes to
[1:50:46] school good young man love brother
[1:50:50] brother
[1:50:51] Moses mes
[1:50:54] awesome goes to
[1:50:58] school as many of you as all of us we go
[1:51:01] to work go to school
[1:51:03] we we are in this world but we are not
[1:51:07] of the
[1:51:08] world so what makes him
[1:51:13] different reminds me of the story
[1:51:15] remember
[1:51:16] that how they asked them why does this
[1:51:20] man this colored man why why is it
[1:51:26] harder he works but he always has his
[1:51:29] chest
[1:51:31] out he gives it his
[1:51:33] all why does he act like that why why
[1:51:37] does brother Moses act like that like he
[1:51:40] does a Christian young man at school or
[1:51:43] work or wherever he goes why does he act
[1:51:45] like that he acts different from
[1:51:47] everyone
[1:51:48] else oh he says I'll tell you
[1:51:53] why you know the land where he comes
[1:51:59] from his father's the
[1:52:02] king oh yeah so so thank you brother
[1:52:05] Moses so so why do you act the way you
[1:52:09] do because the land where you come
[1:52:12] from your father's the
[1:52:14] king so how what do we act
[1:52:18] like people run over
[1:52:20] over people will no
[1:52:23] joy we act like the son of the
[1:52:27] king because we are the son of the king
[1:52:31] we are children of the king and we
[1:52:33] should conduct ourselves like that at
[1:52:35] all
[1:52:37] times it is
[1:52:39] him the king
[1:52:42] messiah messiah is the kingdom of
[1:52:48] God this is this is the in the message
[1:52:50] Messiah brother says you see what
[1:52:53] Messiah
[1:52:55] is Messiah
[1:52:57] is the kingdom of
[1:52:59] God and we are
[1:53:02] Messi or little
[1:53:04] Messiah what are we we are in that
[1:53:09] kingdom do we act like that all the time
[1:53:12] do we speak like that all the
[1:53:14] time do we treat each other like that
[1:53:17] all the
[1:53:18] time no white
[1:53:21] not it's not going to be good enough on
[1:53:24] that
[1:53:25] day the kingdom of God was n
[1:53:29] me the kingdom of God was at
[1:53:34] hand I want to know I want to make sure
[1:53:38] that I can say the kingdom of God was
[1:53:41] Within
[1:53:42] Me is within me that's where it is I'm
[1:53:46] not looking for the kingdom somewhere
[1:53:48] else side and when I receive the Holy
[1:53:53] Ghost I receive the kingdom of
[1:53:56] God and all that the kingdom
[1:53:59] has is at my disposal in my
[1:54:03] hand Jesus said that all that the father
[1:54:06] has given
[1:54:08] me it is
[1:54:10] mine not a one will be
[1:54:15] lost I thought the other
[1:54:18] day when you search your life and you
[1:54:22] say you know you always got to make
[1:54:26] sure hard to ask you how many of you
[1:54:28] have the Holy
[1:54:33] Ghost wait a minute did I walk into a
[1:54:35] church
[1:54:41] what you're not in the Kingdom without
[1:54:43] the Holy
[1:54:46] Ghost that's right now don't just raise
[1:54:49] it it because I asked the
[1:54:51] question but after receiving the Holy
[1:54:55] Ghost and the power it brings to your
[1:54:58] life joy and the righteousness it
[1:55:02] brings I sat there the other
[1:55:06] day and I said Thank You
[1:55:09] Lord I could never have lived in the
[1:55:12] time of
[1:55:15] David listen closely
[1:55:18] church I could never never have lived in
[1:55:20] the time of the
[1:55:23] disciples I've already
[1:55:26] tasted like for the god of
[1:55:30] Glory dwell in this heart I could not
[1:55:34] even fathom the the the
[1:55:37] thought of God above me I can't fathom
[1:55:41] that no more I want you to go with me
[1:55:44] right now I can't faom what it was
[1:55:47] like for Isaiah and Jeremiah
[1:55:51] to have God above
[1:55:53] them I can't fathom what it was like the
[1:55:57] disciples to have God with
[1:55:59] them because now we have
[1:56:03] experienced God in
[1:56:05] us that is the ultimate goal
[1:56:09] church that the kingdom of God which is
[1:56:13] the Messianic
[1:56:15] Empire will now come in my day and would
[1:56:20] dwell in this
[1:56:22] heart and this would be a subject of the
[1:56:26] Kingdom I said Lord I couldn't have
[1:56:28] lived in those
[1:56:29] times
[1:56:31] wonderful but they went
[1:56:34] down with a promise I don't have to go
[1:56:38] down with the
[1:56:39] promise I've already been given the
[1:56:42] promise the Holy
[1:56:44] Ghost what to show and prove that I am
[1:56:48] part of that
[1:56:50] that I will be
[1:56:53] there I don't know if you believe
[1:56:56] that my conviction that's what I
[1:56:59] believe I couldn't live in those
[1:57:02] times this is a greater
[1:57:04] time they long to live in this
[1:57:08] time what is it that the kingdom of God
[1:57:12] could be
[1:57:14] inside they couldn't answer that
[1:57:17] question but we can answer it
[1:57:21] the kingdom of God has
[1:57:23] come and now it dwells in the hearts of
[1:57:26] the
[1:57:27] Believers Mah is the kingdom of
[1:57:31] God that's what makes it the Messianic
[1:57:34] Empire can I have a little bit more
[1:57:37] time barely heating up right
[1:57:41] now maybe some of you might be bored or
[1:57:44] whatever believe me if you knew what was
[1:57:47] coming forth you would you would eat it
[1:57:50] eat all of
[1:57:53] it watch what he says
[1:57:57] Messiah anointed
[1:58:00] one this blows me away this is in the
[1:58:04] the message
[1:58:05] messiah messiah anointed
[1:58:09] one a
[1:58:12] King to deliver a
[1:58:17] king write that down
[1:58:19] Messiah a King to deliver a
[1:58:28] king and then he says you're Kings and
[1:58:35] Priests your
[1:58:37] kings to bring
[1:58:41] in we have it in within our hands to
[1:58:43] bring people into the
[1:58:45] kingdom your king to bring in
[1:58:51] and we're
[1:58:53] priests to
[1:58:56] minister to a messiah
[1:58:59] Mah Messi that one if I said nothing now
[1:59:03] that that's that's an a bomb right there
[1:59:05] nuclear
[1:59:08] warhead Kings to bring in priests to
[1:59:11] minister to a
[1:59:13] messiah and everyone that is part of
[1:59:16] this Messianic Kingdom have a special
[1:59:18] anointing
[1:59:22] Messianic
[1:59:24] anointing but everything's in order
[1:59:28] that's why a prophet doesn't try to be
[1:59:29] an
[1:59:31] apostle because the prophet has a
[1:59:33] certain
[1:59:37] anointing an apostle has a certain
[1:59:40] anointing evangelist has an
[1:59:43] anointing a teacher has an
[1:59:45] anointing a pastor has a certain
[1:59:48] anointing
[1:59:50] certain what is it it's the way he set
[1:59:52] up his
[1:59:56] kingdom when I look at this I say
[1:59:59] gosh help me let us fulfill
[2:00:03] this let us fulfill this in our
[2:00:07] time we live in a time where everyone
[2:00:09] wants it
[2:00:13] easy yeah
[2:00:15] yeah everyone wants it
[2:00:18] easy people say I've been at this and I
[2:00:21] and I've seen this
[2:00:23] lately I've been at this a long time
[2:00:25] I've suffered a lot
[2:00:29] brother what do they do put their guards
[2:00:32] down and put at risk everything that
[2:00:35] they have lived
[2:00:37] for everything that they have suffered
[2:00:39] for put it all at
[2:00:42] risk say no one has suffered like
[2:00:48] me all because they don't want to
[2:00:52] suffer they want to put it on cruise
[2:00:54] control and just Cruise it all the way
[2:00:56] to
[2:01:00] no press the
[2:01:03] battle I don't have no strength brother
[2:01:07] perfect strength by Perfect
[2:01:09] weakness tell your neighbor neighbor
[2:01:11] press the
[2:01:12] battle this is the kingdom now press the
[2:01:17] battle come on tell your neighbor you're
[2:01:20] not telling your neighbor press the
[2:01:22] battle press the
[2:01:24] battle stop we belong to that Kingdom
[2:01:29] church that's why this Prosperity
[2:01:32] Gospel that gospel is not the gospel
[2:01:35] that John spoke
[2:01:37] about John preached his
[2:01:40] gospel got his head chopped
[2:01:44] off but this Prosperity
[2:01:48] Gospel did it all all we have to do is
[2:01:51] reap the
[2:01:54] benefits bunch of
[2:01:56] nonsense I don't know such a
[2:01:59] gospel nor do I preach a gospel like
[2:02:04] that that's not the gospel of the
[2:02:08] Kingdom that is a man-made
[2:02:12] gospel why they don't like scriptures
[2:02:14] like second Timothy
[2:02:17] 2:12 if we
[2:02:20] suffer we shall also reign with
[2:02:23] him and if we deny him he'll also deny
[2:02:28] us with me if I don't suffer with
[2:02:32] Christ I cannot reign with
[2:02:36] him why do you think that she doesn't
[2:02:38] have to go through the Great
[2:02:42] Tribulation because she's
[2:02:45] gone oh come on church because she comes
[2:02:48] to church church and she receives her
[2:02:51] judgment right
[2:02:52] now is going on the
[2:02:59] courtship I'm going to say it again the
[2:03:02] courtship is going on this is the
[2:03:05] Judgment seat of
[2:03:09] Christ and and in this judgment seat of
[2:03:14] Christ we're in a courtship with
[2:03:17] him see if we go on with him or
[2:03:21] not to see if we're going to be engaged
[2:03:24] with him or
[2:03:28] not that's
[2:03:31] justification brother BR says that Judas
[2:03:33] is
[2:03:34] SC he was justified and
[2:03:38] Sanctified even Jesus called him
[2:03:41] friend friend do what you came to
[2:03:46] do but when it went to court
[2:03:49] no no he was his name was not in that
[2:03:54] L that's what the courtship is for
[2:03:58] is come on church I'm going to say it
[2:04:00] again that's what courtship is all
[2:04:03] about you got to find out if your name
[2:04:05] is there or
[2:04:07] not if it is brother Bram
[2:04:10] says's Book of
[2:04:13] Life is the marriage
[2:04:17] certificate and if your name's
[2:04:20] you got a marriage
[2:04:22] certificate I'm getting
[2:04:26] married part of my love
[2:04:32] story the reason is that character is
[2:04:34] never made without
[2:04:39] suffering suffering because you made
[2:04:41] wrong decisions is not suffering for
[2:04:45] Christ a hard time brother this isn't
[2:04:49] made wrong
[2:04:51] decisions that's not suffering for
[2:04:53] Christ that's suffering for for
[2:04:55] our feel in the
[2:04:58] blank this sometimes our right this is
[2:05:02] some things even though you suffer God
[2:05:04] Will Make A
[2:05:07] Way if you're his now can I have just
[2:05:10] like like 10
[2:05:13] minutes then you can kick back and you
[2:05:16] can the
[2:05:17] weather
[2:05:20] while I get ready for part
[2:05:24] two there's a price to pay to reach the
[2:05:31] sum the price is
[2:05:35] much is it worth the
[2:05:41] cost you get it so many times people say
[2:05:44] wow I don't know why this brother prays
[2:05:46] and oh the Lord hears him
[2:05:51] pray the don't seem to hear
[2:05:53] me I'll tell you the difference one is
[2:05:56] in prayer and
[2:05:59] fasting
[2:06:01] word and the other one is sitting back
[2:06:03] watching
[2:06:05] TV hearing
[2:06:07] music oh they need you prayer oh yeah
[2:06:09] yeah
[2:06:10] pray there's no anointing

[2:06:24] word oh those ones don't hit very good
[2:06:27] huh
[2:06:30] [Music]
[2:06:33] like we must give him our
[2:06:37] hearts our bodies as a living
[2:06:41] sacrif no other
[2:06:42] way cost to be a Christian it
[2:06:46] costs to make sure to know that you're
[2:06:49] the part of the bride of
[2:06:52] Christ seeking him day day
[2:06:56] out but many don't want to pay that
[2:07:00] price because this guy he likes to kick
[2:07:03] back all the
[2:07:04] time feed me tomorrow today I'm gonna
[2:07:08] watch me a good
[2:07:11] movie prob watching movie here and there
[2:07:14] not saying that get get where I'm
[2:07:17] at makes the place of those
[2:07:21] things it might cost you everything
[2:07:24] you've
[2:07:27] got it might cost you your
[2:07:31] home you still want to follow
[2:07:40] him it might cost you your
[2:07:44] friendship it might cost you your
[2:07:47] parties it might cost you your place at
[2:07:50] your
[2:07:52] Club whatever it'll cost it cost
[2:07:56] you it'll cost everything that's
[2:08:01] worldly and pertains to the
[2:08:04] world he won't take away what he gave
[2:08:07] you everything the world has that you
[2:08:09] got from the
[2:08:11] world all those things let it
[2:08:14] go you'll have to separate yourself from
[2:08:17] everything that's worldly
[2:08:21] it shows that you're of a different
[2:08:24] Kingdom well I can't do it
[2:08:27] brother right you
[2:08:29] can't Henry Ford once said Henry you say
[2:08:33] I can't do
[2:08:34] it or if you say I can do it you're
[2:08:38] right either
[2:08:42] way that's
[2:08:44] Peter what he feared
[2:08:47] happened
[2:08:49] what he believed
[2:08:51] happened believed he could walk on water
[2:08:53] and he walked on
[2:08:55] water he feared that he was going to
[2:08:57] drown and he started drowning whatever
[2:08:59] you fear or whatever you believe will
[2:09:03] happen but you shall receive
[2:09:07] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[2:09:10] upon
[2:09:11] you and ye shall be
[2:09:14] Witnesses this is where we want to get
[2:09:17] to now
[2:09:18] that the bride will follow the groom
[2:09:21] Back to
[2:09:27] Eden this will be the full restoring of
[2:09:30] the
[2:09:32] Kingdom the bride body must follow the
[2:09:38] head it is part of his
[2:09:42] resurrection and part of the
[2:09:45] mystery she is part of of the
[2:09:50] mystery watch Paul here this is so
[2:09:54] tremendous and and I'm going to I'm
[2:09:56] gonna start to close
[2:09:57] here up on this when we when maybe next
[2:10:03] Sunday the moment that
[2:10:07] man took of that tree of knowledge of
[2:10:10] Good and
[2:10:12] Evil friendship was cut
[2:10:17] off
[2:10:19] 1986 here's our pastor
[2:10:23] again he said the first thing that had
[2:10:25] to be
[2:10:27] restored is
[2:10:30] friendship why because friendship is the
[2:10:33] first
[2:10:37] step part of my love
[2:10:40] story the first thing I was an enemy to
[2:10:44] God but my friendship with God had to be
[2:10:47] restored
[2:10:49] he said that and it hit me like a like a
[2:10:51] ton of bricks I said Lord I had never I
[2:10:54] had never looked at it in this in this
[2:10:57] light friendship the first thing that
[2:11:00] God
[2:11:02] does he's looking for a man to be his
[2:11:06] friend why because because the
[2:11:08] friendship he had with Adam was was
[2:11:12] terminated looking I need I I just need
[2:11:15] one
[2:11:17] friend God found himself by himself
[2:11:21] again oh church if that don't break your
[2:11:25] heart want to be by himself he wanted a
[2:11:29] family he wanted a friend a son to be
[2:11:32] able to talk
[2:11:33] to walk in the co of the
[2:11:36] evening and have a discussion with his
[2:11:40] friend but when that friendship was
[2:11:43] broke he look for another friend where
[2:11:46] can I find me a friend
[2:11:49] where's a friend all of a sudden he
[2:11:51] finds a
[2:11:53] man oh he's from Earth of the
[2:11:56] Cal he's he's one of those
[2:12:00] idolators said I'm going to give him an
[2:12:02] unconditional
[2:12:05] Covenant make sure that Abraham he's
[2:12:09] going to make it he's going to be my
[2:12:12] friend he doing showing by
[2:12:17] example and
[2:12:19] shadows that friendship would be
[2:12:21] restored back with
[2:12:24] God that's why he said
[2:12:27] Abraham called him the friend of
[2:12:31] God because friendship had to be
[2:12:34] restored
[2:12:36] first even before
[2:12:38] courtship friendship had to be restored
[2:12:42] Hallelujah I don't know about you but I
[2:12:44] look at that and I
[2:12:45] like that was in the kingdom of God
[2:12:48] God that friendship but under the
[2:12:51] Messianic
[2:12:53] Empire let's see what else we find here
[2:12:57] Song of Solomon
[2:12:59] 516 how many of you men like reading
[2:13:03] Song of
[2:13:06] Solomon well if you want to be romantic
[2:13:11] read if I was getting married
[2:13:16] again
[2:13:18] watch what he says
[2:13:20] here 56 his mouth is most
[2:13:28] sweet y he is Al together
[2:13:33] lovely this is my
[2:13:37] beloved and this is my
[2:13:44] friend see that sister sitting right
[2:13:47] there
[2:13:50] yeah
[2:13:55] my are you with me oh you knew how much
[2:14:00] an expectation God
[2:14:04] is so much
[2:14:08] expectation he wants to he he doesn't
[2:14:10] ever want to be aart from
[2:14:13] you that's him it's the Messianic
[2:14:17] Kingdom
[2:14:21] it's a romantic
[2:14:23] Kingdom I'm going to say it again it's a
[2:14:25] romantic
[2:14:27] Kingdom it's my
[2:14:33] story can you raise up your Bible again
[2:14:35] say my
[2:14:38] story he made a way and if I and if I go
[2:14:41] into the next part of this I ain't going
[2:14:42] to get out for about a two more
[2:14:46] hours but I want to just say the first
[2:14:49] thing he restored was
[2:14:52] friendship and that's why Proverbs 18:24
[2:14:57] says a man that ha friends must show
[2:15:00] himself
[2:15:03] friendly and there is a
[2:15:06] friend that sticketh closer than a
[2:15:12] brother who is that friend that sticks
[2:15:14] closer than a
[2:15:16] brother
[2:15:20] his
[2:15:22] bride I'm gonna say it again his
[2:15:25] bride that's the friend that's
[2:15:29] closer that's who she is my
[2:15:36] beloved I'm gonna I'm going to stop
[2:15:38] right there I feel the Lord telling me
[2:15:39] to
[2:15:40] stop but we'll pick it up from
[2:15:43] there this is where we want to we want
[2:15:45] to get to in the next one musicians
[2:15:53] come this is where we want to start with
[2:15:55] the next
[2:15:57] one is when Paul catches the
[2:16:06] inspiration I'm gonna let this everyone
[2:16:08] get to where they need to
[2:16:14] get Paul had
[2:16:16] the
[2:16:18] he had the Scrolls he had the Old
[2:16:23] Testament but he catches the
[2:16:28] inspiration inspiration is
[2:16:32] this you hear now a lot of
[2:16:35] people that'll
[2:16:38] say that picture is a
[2:16:42] hoax anybody hear
[2:16:44] that we heard that I gu think last
[2:16:46] Sunday was mentioned right
[2:16:49] that's not actually what it
[2:16:57] is I only have one thing to
[2:17:01] say one
[2:17:03] thing brother Henry Henry how could it
[2:17:06] be a
[2:17:07] FX when I came from that
[2:17:13] life I came from
[2:17:15] that from that logos from Christ the
[2:17:19] anointing I came out of him you came out
[2:17:22] of him you're his bride you came out of
[2:17:26] him because you were in him from the
[2:17:28] beginning this is what Paul
[2:17:32] caught he had read Genesis 1 in the
[2:17:35] beginning God created but all of a
[2:17:38] sudden he catches the
[2:17:41] inspiration he catches the
[2:17:43] inspiration and this is what Paul begins
[2:17:46] to write
[2:17:48] according as he has chosen
[2:17:52] Us in
[2:17:54] him before Genesis
[2:17:58] 1: I'm going to say it again he has
[2:18:00] chosen
[2:18:02] Us in him before Genesis
[2:18:07] 1 the foundation of the world was ever
[2:18:11] laid he already chose us in
[2:18:15] him woo when I seen this I said PA bless
[2:18:18] you brother
[2:18:20] pauloin the spirit that brother
[2:18:24] Paul in
[2:18:27] time the same light that said I am
[2:18:30] Jesus
[2:18:32] th we came from him I'm going to say it
[2:18:36] again church we came from
[2:18:38] him before there was a
[2:18:41] beginning before everything that there
[2:18:43] was before any part of the kingdom was
[2:18:46] ever formed
[2:18:49] in the Kingdom
[2:18:51] already that's why he says there is
[2:18:54] therefore
[2:18:55] now no
[2:18:58] condemnation to those that were in
[2:19:00] Christ
[2:19:02] Jesus not after the flesh but after the
