[21:06] amen we have a testimony can invite our
[21:11] brother
[21:23] Jameson God bless
[21:25] you um I had it in my heart to tell you
[21:28] guys it's a little testimony that
[21:29] happened
[21:31] today oh two but
[21:34] um usually today I had a field trip it's
[21:37] an all day field
[21:39] [Music]
[21:43] trip and usually when those happen I
[21:46] lose a lot of um lose a lot of time at
[21:48] school and I accumulate a lot of
[21:55] work and um usually gets really
[21:57] stressful and like
[22:00] annoying and usually I just deal with it
[22:03] I just go ahead and just do
[22:07] whatever but the night before I decided
[22:09] to approach things a little
[22:18] differently and I asked the Lord to make
[22:20] a way for me to be able to go on this
[22:22] field
[22:26] trip and um in every single my classes
[22:29] we did absolutely
[22:32] nothing it sounds a little funny but
[22:34] Brothers this never
[22:37] happens and I praise the Lord that I had
[22:40] nothing to do and that he opened
[22:46] way for a couple years second
[22:50] testimony was for like almost two or two
[22:54] years and a half I suffered with
[22:56] something that's called turf toe
[23:05] it's basically um uh where you have like
[23:07] a
[23:08] nerve a nerve misf in your big
[23:14] toe and it constantly just um misfiring
[23:18] like it hurts it feels like if you would
[23:19] stub your toe and the initial pain would
[23:22] stay there it's it's something
[23:25] unbearable and um I think maybe two two
[23:29] months ago on a
[23:33] Wednesday my dad called out that
[23:37] demon and thanks be the Lord I've never
[23:40] I haven't suffered
[23:43] since and um through all this I realized
[23:46] that even though there's nothing too big
[23:48] for
[23:53] God but there's nothing too small
[23:57] either God bless
[24:04] you amen amen thank you for that brother

[27:31] you it's good to see each uh person
[27:35] here I'm a little bit shy I haven't been

[27:42] here it's good to have my my good friend
[27:45] brother Morton wherever he
[27:48] is they made my day got to see
[27:52] them but I got to see each and every one
[27:54] of you
[27:57] also
[27:59] so the Lord help
[28:01] us I want to first of all thank our
[28:03] pastor for the for the
[28:06] confidence he knows why I say
[28:08] that that's something thing about our
[28:11] pastor he will pull it out of
[28:14] you sometimes I think ah I wish you'd
[28:17] have a little bit of
[28:20] Mercy that's exactly right this is
[28:23] Mercy this is for our
[28:25] benefit so uh not to take up much more
[28:30] time you turn to our scripture in
[28:33] Matthew
[28:37] 2514 message may get a little
[28:41] personal because it uh things that I've
[28:44] been dealing
[28:50] with and it
[28:52] reads give you a little bit of time say
[28:54] Amen when you got
[28:56] it and reads for the Kingdom of Heaven
[28:59] is a man traveling into a far country
[29:01] who called his own servants and
[29:03] delivered unto them his
[29:09] goods and unto one he gave five talents
[29:12] and to another two and to another one to
[29:15] every man according to his several
[29:17] ability and straightway took his
[29:26] journey 16 then he that had received the
[29:28] five talents went and traded with the
[29:31] same and made them other five
[29:37] talents so he produced something
[29:40] there and likewise he that had received
[29:44] two he also gained other
[29:48] two also
[29:51] produced but he that had received one
[29:53] went and died into the
[29:57] Earth
[29:58] and hid his Lord's
[30:00] money he did not
[30:03] produce go go ahead and be
[30:06] seated I may read some other parts of
[30:08] that scripture
[30:10] but I'll let you be
[30:13] seated but um I do want to
[30:18] say that probably was the most important
[30:20] message I've ever heard brother
[30:24] Caleb you know because it did something
[30:26] to me okay said got to take get
[30:30] personal you know when he especially
[30:32] when he was talking about the the
[30:34] eclipse that's
[30:36] coming how many have been following
[30:40] it I'm just gonna just reiterate what he
[30:45] said but have you ever in any
[30:49] time seen a sign like
[30:52] that be fulfilled before your very
[30:56] eyes first in and 2017 started off in
[31:01] Salem Seven Cities of
[31:04] Salem and this
[31:07] this and and then seven years
[31:11] later it's going to pass Seven Cities of
[31:15] Nineveh so I see the
[31:18] 777 which is God's
[31:20] number and then what are the
[31:24] odds of the trajectory of this eclipse
[31:29] to pass the way it
[31:32] did and then hit the ex and over
[31:38] Rapture in in the state where the
[31:41] Prophet was
[31:43] from so you ever thought you think about
[31:46] that what are the odds of that
[31:49] happening very slim to
[31:52] none but it's just a sign for
[31:55] us it's a sign for theie
[31:59] showing like I said first he shows it in
[32:01] the
[32:02] heavens but it shows something's coming
[32:06] right so I just wanted to I just wanted
[32:08] to start off with that because it it
[32:10] really impacted
[32:12] me so it brought me to this if I could
[32:16] put a a
[32:20] title it's
[32:22] inflation the
[32:24] subtitle am I adding value
[32:29] how many knows what inflation
[32:31] is when you hear the word inflation what
[32:33] comes to
[32:35] mind oh there's no money right prices
[32:39] are
[32:40] high all all those are
[32:42] right all it's partially
[32:46] correct but would it
[32:49] surprise would it surprise if I told
[32:52] you that inflation is
[32:56] actually too much money in the
[33:05] economy there's so much money in the
[33:07] economy that they have pumped
[33:11] in that there was a lot of purchasing
[33:13] power right
[33:16] now with the stimulus
[33:20] money the deferment of all these
[33:24] payments there's a lot of money in
[33:26] circulation right now
[33:29] the FED has been printing a lot of
[33:33] money tons of
[33:35] money giving money to
[33:38] Ukraine giving money to the to all all
[33:40] these situations that are going
[33:43] on the situation at the border is not
[33:47] cheap they say to house and to feed
[33:50] certain of
[33:53] people is costing Millions upon Millions
[33:56] dollars
[33:59] man how many have been following
[34:02] that so in what is inflation let's let's
[34:05] define it
[34:06] okay it says more jobs and higher
[34:11] wages increase household
[34:17] incomes that lead to a rise in consumer
[34:24] spending further increasing demand
[34:29] and the the the scope for firms to
[34:31] increase the
[34:34] prices when this
[34:37] happens a large number of businesses and
[34:41] sectors said when when there like I said
[34:44] when they pump out so much
[34:45] money the these companies start to
[34:47] inflate
[34:49] prices but there's another scope that
[34:53] happens so I don't remember the the co
[34:56] lockdowns
[34:59] it seems like it was forever ago
[35:01] right it was just a few years
[35:04] ago he said but what happened during
[35:07] that
[35:08] time during the lockdown no one could go
[35:12] anywhere I said and they pumped all
[35:14] kinds of money for
[35:17] assistance but there was nobody to work
[35:19] nobody wanted to
[35:22] work so what happened there was a
[35:25] bottleneck that
[35:26] happened
[35:28] because there was not
[35:30] people to work the
[35:33] factories to work in certain
[35:36] jobs the goods were not being delivered
[35:39] to the
[35:41] people you you see that there was a lot
[35:44] of how many remember the picture with
[35:45] the ships in the
[35:49] harbor well the ships were full of were
[35:51] of
[35:54] goods lots of goods
[35:56] there but no one to want to
[35:59] work no one willing to
[36:02] go and to go and get the goods from the
[36:06] ship get them off the
[36:09] harbor and bring them into the land or
[36:12] bring them to the
[36:13] people so that also caused a
[36:17] bottleneck because what
[36:20] happened there how many were trying to
[36:23] buy a car during that
[36:25] time we know that there was a shortage a
[36:28] shortage of computer
[36:32] chips a shortage of a lot of electronic
[36:36] parts so what
[36:39] happened so because there was a shortage
[36:41] of of of these
[36:44] parts it caused an inflation of the
[36:47] prices of
[36:49] vehicles so people were buying vehicles
[36:52] at 10 20 $30,000
[36:56] overpriced
[36:59] so there was an inflation that happened
[37:02] right and this part's a little dry in
[37:04] the beginning but just bear with me
[37:05] trying to set a little Foundation
[37:11] okay so did you know in
[37:15] 1913 the dollar was worth a
[37:19] dollar
[37:20] right 1913 the dollar was worth a
[37:24] dollar the purchasing power of a dollar
[37:29] was a dollar so we fast forward now to
[37:34] 2024 and they're
[37:36] saying that in order to to be equivalent
[37:39] to that $1 in
[37:43] 19113 let see if I can find it so I can
[37:45] read it
[37:47] here but they're saying that that dollar
[37:50] today you would have to make a total of
[37:51] $31 I
[37:56] believe to make $31
[37:59] today to be equivalent to the dollar
[38:01] back in
[38:04] 19113 so what is this do to the
[38:07] economy you young people that maybe want
[38:09] to buy a home in the near
[38:13] future what has happened to the home
[38:17] prices they have the prices have
[38:19] inflated so
[38:22] bad at a house that was worth
[38:26] 190,000
[38:29] brother Justin correct me if I'm wrong
[38:30] they're worth about 350 to 400,000
[38:35] now so like I said because they have
[38:37] pumped all this money into the
[38:40] economy the more money they pumped
[38:43] out the more devaluation of the dollar
[38:46] that has
[38:48] been so they say since 1913 it has lost
[38:51] about 96 96% of it of its purchasing
[38:56] power
[39:58] it so what Satan uses
[40:00] this to bring fear to the
[40:04] people to back up the people into a
[40:08] corner they feel like they don't know
[40:10] where to go what am I going to do am I
[40:12] going to eat this
[40:14] month I know some of the elderly people
[40:16] being on fixed
[40:17] incomes uh elderly people being on fixed
[40:26] incomes what they do it destroys their
[40:29] their their um their
[40:32] finances so Satan is using this
[40:36] tool and the platform is being set
[40:39] up so that eventually this boycott that
[40:42] we've been hearing
[40:45] about it's going to force the
[40:48] people they said like we've heard this
[40:50] is another
[40:51] message to take the mark to take the
[40:54] Mark or
[40:55] not you you cannot buy you cannot
[40:58] sell we're
[41:01] there just about
[41:05] there so so so Satan like I said this is
[41:08] a tool that he's
[41:11] using but don't fear there's no reason
[41:14] to
[41:15] fear because Satan only
[41:18] mimics and he and he he only does what
[41:21] he sees God
[41:24] doing well how does God use inflation
[41:28] watch this and I don't it shouldn't be
[41:31] that long tonight
[41:33] okay how does God use
[41:36] inflation you ever thought think about
[41:39] that the natural types the
[41:42] spiritual okay so do you know that time
[41:46] they call it the great
[41:49] equalizer it doesn't matter who you
[41:51] are if you're a
[41:53] celebrity a millionaire a president of
[41:57] the United
[41:58] States
[42:00] whoever time is the great
[42:03] equalizer because you cannot purchase no
[42:05] more of
[42:06] it you're not giving more of it you
[42:10] cannot obtain it
[42:12] anyhow the time that you're
[42:16] allotted is the time that you're
[42:18] given you can't buy any more of
[42:21] it so keep that in
[42:23] mind so young people what do you the
[42:26] scripture what is does the scripture
[42:28] say honor your mother and
[42:31] father so that your time is not cut even
[42:33] more
[42:35] short now we know that God cut the
[42:38] time he says if the days were not
[42:43] shortened no flesh would be
[42:45] saved and we're going to get to that and
[42:47] how that gives value to the
[42:51] bride it's God is going to show you
[42:55] tonight the value that each one of you
[42:58] have the value that you have
[43:01] Paul amen amen what does brother brand
[43:04] say how how many worlds is your soul
[43:10] worth
[43:12] anybody how
[43:15] many when he says
[43:18] 10,000 and then he says 10
[43:20] million is that a
[43:23] contradiction we'll find that in a bit
[43:25] we'll find that in a bit
[43:28] so Satan is mimicking what God is
[43:31] doing watch
[43:35] this remember
[43:38] something when there is a product in
[43:41] demand or when there's a shortage of a
[43:45] product what happens people go
[43:49] crazy and people will pay
[43:51] over they'll pay a top dollar for
[43:55] it how many remember the incident with
[43:57] the toilet
[44:00] paper everybody was freaking out
[44:03] right oh my goodness I think I had my
[44:06] brother even uh Nathan he wanted to go
[44:08] steal it from my house when we were in
[44:09] out of
[44:13] town but watch it it sounds
[44:16] funny but cut something
[44:20] short let's something let something let
[44:23] there be a shortage of
[44:25] it and people will do anything for
[44:28] it people will fight tooth and nail for
[44:32] it amen amen that also causes
[44:36] inflation it causes if if I had a
[44:40] million of
[44:41] these I can't give them
[44:44] away you know and there's a million of
[44:46] there's there's sufficient to go around
[44:48] for
[44:50] everybody I can't give this
[44:52] away you know people waste water like
[44:54] it's
[44:56] nothing but let the same bottle of water
[44:58] right
[44:59] here let them put out a news
[45:03] notice that there is a shortage of
[45:06] water and there's only a few left of
[45:10] these and Watch What
[45:13] Happens amen amen the value of this will
[45:19] Skyrocket amen
[45:22] amen so like I said this is a
[45:28] it was a little bit tough for me to put
[45:32] together it everything that could go
[45:35] wrong went
[45:37] wrong it's and it's been a it's been a
[45:39] bad I was telling brother
[45:41] Caleb you know how he felt that
[45:43] heaviness the other
[45:46] day I can't even imagine with the burden
[45:48] that he deals
[45:51] with but with my little
[45:53] burden I was telling the wife and I
[45:55] shouldn't have told her cuz she got l
[45:59] scared I was driving and I I like almost
[46:02] fell
[46:04] asleep a stick
[46:09] shift
[46:11] so so there there there's that he
[46:14] I but it's like Tommy said he said we
[46:16] got to shake ourselves
[46:19] off Tommy I tried to wiggle my way out a
[46:21] little bit because I'm like brother
[46:22] Caleb I don't I don't feel ready for
[46:25] this he says my grace is sufficient for
[46:29] you perfect strength through perfect
[46:33] weakness what do you say to
[46:35] that you got to be
[46:37] obedient I have to be
[46:40] obedient so when something is in
[46:43] demand and production is
[46:46] low value
[46:50] skyrockets amen amen Matthew
[46:54] 24:22 so you could read it okay
[46:58] except those days be
[47:01] shortened there should be no flesh
[47:05] saved but for the elect
[47:08] sake those days shall be
[47:10] shortened what happens when you cut
[47:12] something
[47:14] short now the word sake stood out to
[47:19] me and and it brought me to to to Define
[47:23] it but watch watch the synonym of of
[47:26] sake
[47:30] for the elect
[47:32] sake if you see number five and
[47:34] six is
[47:37] gain so he's cutting
[47:40] time so that the bride can gain
[47:44] value so she now like I said we're going
[47:46] to build up to it
[47:48] okay you're going to see how valued you
[47:51] are of
[47:52] God you're going to see that you're the
[47:55] purchase that almighty
[47:58] God God of the
[48:01] universe can you imagine would step
[48:04] aside step aside from his
[48:08] majesty and would come and shed his
[48:10] blood for you and
[48:12] I that you meditate on that and that
[48:16] blows your
[48:18] mind and we're coming up on Easter so
[48:20] we're going to hear about
[48:22] that but can you
[48:25] imagine Mighty
[48:29] God stepping aside from his
[48:33] majesty getting off his
[48:36] throne just for you and
[48:38] I how much value was
[48:41] that what what should that do to
[48:45] us what should that do to
[48:48] me my
[48:50] goodness but so for her
[48:54] sake for her gain for her profit which
[48:59] is also
[49:00] gain which he'll cut the days or the
[49:04] time for her
[49:07] value so that means now when she
[49:11] speaks there's something that
[49:13] happens when she
[49:15] prays it produces
[49:18] something it should produce something
[49:21] right that's where this message hit
[49:24] me cuz we we say many times and I've
[49:27] said it
[49:28] before catch my spirit on how I say this
[49:32] okay now we have said I have
[49:36] said we have the best in this
[49:39] church the word that we hear from this
[49:42] church from this
[49:44] Pulpit amen amen I have to agree with
[49:47] that then I asked myself the
[49:51] question with the
[49:53] best this word that's the best what am I
[49:57] producing
[49:58] with I should I me I should be producing
[50:02] the
[50:04] best and I saw myself many
[50:07] times just sitting
[50:09] idle doing nothing hiding the
[50:13] talent like the one that was giving the
[50:16] one so I'm we have to do something about
[50:20] that or that will be taken away from me
[50:24] it will be taken away from me so so what
[50:27] is it parable of the 10
[50:30] virgins he a lot about Parables parable
[50:33] of the 10
[50:35] virgins let me let me ask you a question
[50:38] how many of them
[50:40] slept all of them slept they all slept
[50:45] but one heard the
[50:47] call when one of them imagine this so we
[50:51] got the wise virgin and the foolish
[50:54] virgin they both have the word
[50:57] I remember our founding Pastor say one
[51:00] time does the foolish virgin have the
[51:04] word do they know the word absolutely
[51:07] sometimes even
[51:09] better so what's the difference what
[51:12] produced with the word and the other
[51:15] just stayed with
[51:17] it I don't want to be caught in
[51:20] that so we have to
[51:23] produce I have to
[51:25] produce something has to
[51:27] done because I'll tell you one
[51:30] thing so when they took the the United
[51:34] States off the gold
[51:37] standard in
[51:40] 1971 they took the value from the
[51:44] dollar there's nothing backing it up
[51:47] now we know that the United States now
[51:50] is is they go off what was called
[51:52] treasury
[51:55] bonds and brother Carlos correct me if
[51:57] I'm wrong there nothing but I will
[52:00] use there's nothing what I will
[52:07] use I owe
[52:10] you that's all it
[52:12] is it's an i
[52:15] you it's paper backing
[52:18] paper so that's what happened when they
[52:20] took us off the gold
[52:24] standard now if I run it now
[52:27] and the natural types of
[52:29] spiritual I see that there's a lot of
[52:31] word out right
[52:33] now there's word on the
[52:35] internet on the tablet in the books in
[52:39] the people there's tons of word out
[52:41] right now there's lots of purchasing
[52:45] power we have it in our
[52:47] hands the word is the purchasing
[52:51] power but you know what ruins the
[52:55] economy there's what's called the supply
[52:57] and demand
[52:59] curve so there's a
[53:03] supply and there's a
[53:04] demand okay so if there's lots of
[53:07] purchasing power
[53:10] out okay we can buy a lot of
[53:13] goods but production is not keeping up
[53:15] with
[53:17] that then that's what's causing
[53:20] inflation too much purchasing
[53:23] power not enough Goods to go around
[53:28] it inflates the
[53:29] price amen amen are you following
[53:33] me watch
[53:37] this so we have the word in our
[53:41] hands but it cannot stay in word
[53:44] only it's no difference with the
[53:47] example where they say if the word stays
[53:49] in this
[53:52] form it'll kill
[53:54] you righten
[53:57] it has to become
[53:58] flesh and the only way it becomes
[54:01] flesh I have to produce it you have to
[54:05] produce it we have to produce our
[54:08] part whatever part that we
[54:11] play we have to
[54:13] produce because God's
[54:16] economy the natural types of
[54:18] spiritual supply and demand have to
[54:22] meet when supply and demand
[54:25] meet called
[54:28] equilibrium it's a flourishing
[54:31] economy so I believe in part that you
[54:35] see that that X
[54:38] point in the
[54:40] eclipse that there will be an
[54:43] equilibrium that there will be a people
[54:47] that not only have the
[54:48] word but produce the
[54:51] word it has to produce God's word cannot
[54:55] come back void
[54:57] look there's there's proof back
[54:59] there right brother Diego I got two
[55:02] twins back
[55:04] there the word came
[55:07] out but there was a
[55:09] production the word
[55:11] produced it did not come back
[55:14] void and the proof is back there either
[55:17] my mom or my faith someone stand
[55:21] up there's the proof where's the
[55:25] baby
[55:26] you got show the
[55:28] proof show the
[55:31] product amen amen so we have to produce
[55:35] I have to
[55:37] produce amen Amen brother
[55:41] Bram let me see where I'm at
[55:43] here much time do I
[55:49] have so we
[55:52] see we heard we've heard the message
[55:54] brother Bram
[55:55] says of those that make the word of no
[55:59] effect you've heard that
[56:01] right and we think that it's out
[56:04] there wait a
[56:06] minute if I have the word in my
[56:09] hand in my
[56:11] mind just in my mind and I don't produce
[56:15] with
[56:16] it the word is not
[56:18] producing it's a form of making the word
[56:21] of no
[56:22] effect it's not having an effect on
[56:25] anybody
[56:26] it's not helping anyone it may edify
[56:29] what I
[56:31] know and I can read definitions of
[56:33] brother
[56:34] Bram I can quote brother Bram I can
[56:37] quote brother Tommy tomm I can quote our
[56:40] pastor brother
[56:41] Caleb but if it only stays up here it
[56:45] does no good makes the word of no
[56:48] effect I have to do something with that
[56:51] word that word has to be released
[56:53] through
[56:55] me the only word that this falling this
[56:58] Fallen World will ever
[57:01] know brother Bram is not here Tommy's
[57:04] not here our pastor's here thank
[57:08] God we are the only word that certain
[57:10] people will ever
[57:13] know so that word has to
[57:15] produce it has to produce through
[57:18] you watch brother
[57:21] brand oh so yeah I said
[57:24] that excuse me
[57:26] brother Ron hit this the other day on
[57:28] something our founding Pastor would say
[57:29] a
[57:32] lot he says you better pack the
[57:35] goods packing the
[57:38] goods so I got I point to myself I
[57:41] better be packing the
[57:43] goods head
[57:46] knowledge that's hearing the Bri the
[57:48] bridegroom and not doing nothing with
[57:52] it but the
[57:54] wise oil in their
[57:57] lamp and they did not run
[58:00] out that's the key right
[58:02] there because the foolish had
[58:06] oil but she ran out she stopped
[58:10] producing amen amen she had it in her
[58:14] hands but she could not produce any
[58:17] longer amen
[58:21] amen so it comes to
[58:23] this am I adding to God's economy
[58:28] am I adding
[58:29] value so like I said the dollar lost
[58:32] value 96% of
[58:36] it when it went off the gold
[58:39] standard so if you have the
[58:42] word and no deity to back it
[58:45] up it's paper it's paper it's head it
[58:50] won't do no
[58:51] good it will not
[58:53] produce there's got to be that life
[58:55] behind
[58:58] the life behind the
[59:00] name that's what makes the demons
[59:03] tremble deity has to be
[59:07] present what so we have
[59:11] to excuse
[59:14] me purchasing
[59:16] power see it a little bit different
[59:19] now it's okay to have it you got to have
[59:22] that the money in your in your pocket in
[59:24] your
[59:25] wallet
[59:27] but it has to produce
[59:29] something so we got to pack the
[59:36] goods
[59:38] remember having too much purchasing
[59:41] power and no
[59:43] Supply that means I'm not producing
[59:45] something to give to God's
[59:49] economy will cause an
[59:51] inflation maybe a lot of times maybe I
[59:53] because I know a little bit I inflate my
[59:55] my head a little bit
[59:59] inflation that's the opposite of the
[1:00:01] inflation that we
[1:00:03] want the full word has
[1:00:06] come amen
[1:00:09] amen there's no
[1:00:11] reason that we should not be able to
[1:00:15] produce we have to
[1:00:18] produce amen amen so watch this so this
[1:00:22] is a I wrote this down because I don't
[1:00:23] want to
[1:00:25] forget
[1:00:27] so why is
[1:00:28] it that they want to remove the
[1:00:32] hand from delivering the goods
[1:00:36] remember a person to go to the ship
[1:00:40] Harbor get the
[1:00:42] goods to bring them to
[1:00:44] land so that they can be hand
[1:00:49] delivered to the
[1:00:51] people don't remove the
[1:00:53] hand you remove the hand
[1:00:56] you cause inflation in the
[1:00:59] message then you cause the word to not
[1:01:01] have an
[1:01:02] effect it has to come through the
[1:01:05] hand it's hand
[1:01:08] delivered do you believe
[1:01:14] that what happens many times
[1:01:17] though there's a boycott
[1:01:20] coming there stand to come A World
[1:01:22] Council of churches and a boycott and
[1:01:23] mark of the
[1:01:24] beast
[1:01:28] we have to watch that
[1:01:30] spirit because that spirit will
[1:01:33] come and it'll boycot
[1:01:35] somebody oh I'm gonna cut this person
[1:01:38] off oh I don't want I don't like this
[1:01:40] person for whatever
[1:01:43] reason it's a
[1:01:45] boycot we have to be very
[1:01:47] careful because that spirit will come in
[1:01:49] first like
[1:01:51] that and then we know like I said the
[1:01:53] World Council of churches the mark of
[1:01:54] the beast
[1:01:59] so you have to Pro provide value to
[1:02:02] God's
[1:02:04] economy the word must
[1:02:07] produce you know I appreciate brother
[1:02:09] brother
[1:02:12] Isaac so about a year
[1:02:15] back I hurt my back really
[1:02:18] bad I couldn't walk very
[1:02:21] well so I guess I don't know if they
[1:02:23] announced it at the church and they
[1:02:24] prayed for me
[1:02:27] but he did something for me that really
[1:02:29] that hit
[1:02:31] me and usually when people do something
[1:02:33] for me like that I never
[1:02:37] forget but he took me a basket of a
[1:02:39] bunch of
[1:02:42] goods and he hand delivered them to my
[1:02:46] house and it was not cheap I tell you
[1:02:49] what he had a lot of stuff in there for
[1:02:50] my back a bunch of
[1:02:54] snacks and I appreciate that
[1:02:56] brother thank you but it helped
[1:02:59] me so what what does that show me
[1:03:02] brother brother Robert Rodriguez I had
[1:03:04] never also given him thanks for
[1:03:05] something he
[1:03:08] did
[1:03:09] rodrig when I first moved here we didn't
[1:03:11] have much
[1:03:13] money and uh we're
[1:03:16] struggling and my glasses
[1:03:19] broke and so I had to glue one
[1:03:23] side I didn't have no money I saw
[1:03:26] brother Robert Rodriguez at the Walmart
[1:03:28] one
[1:03:29] time and he and he saw me that I was
[1:03:31] struggling with
[1:03:33] it without
[1:03:35] hesitation pulls out $100 and says
[1:03:38] here go get yourself some
[1:03:41] glasses I'll be pay for

[1:04:23] thoughtful Fair and quick to
[1:04:27] forgive encourage
[1:04:29] others and give praise what Praises
[1:04:34] do being
[1:04:37] neighborly be there for
[1:04:40] others be open to a challenge and be
[1:04:45] accountable and then number seven says
[1:04:48] use your talents and
[1:04:50] gifts this was off a website I can't
[1:04:53] remember the the
[1:04:54] hospital
[1:04:57] they had these seven steps on how to add
[1:04:58] value to
[1:05:01] somebody so that's what I saw brother
[1:05:03] brother
[1:05:04] Isaac I saw that okay I witnessed
[1:05:08] it I was a a a recipient of the
[1:05:13] product and because of
[1:05:16] you I said that help me I appreciate it
[1:05:19] same thing with brother
[1:05:21] Robert so we see these things and that
[1:05:23] there they are up there if you want to
[1:05:25] jot them down
[1:05:28] but it's good to do those
[1:05:29] things many times in the message we're
[1:05:31] just going and going going ah
[1:05:35] whatever and we forget about the person
[1:05:37] next to
[1:05:38] us let me rephrase that I forget about
[1:05:42] the person next to
[1:05:43] me to preach this message I had to make
[1:05:46] a couple of things right with a couple
[1:05:47] of
[1:05:50] people I just have to be
[1:05:52] honest I had to go and make things right
[1:05:57] I could not preach this
[1:05:58] message and have and in my conscience be
[1:06:02] right because that's one of the things
[1:06:04] that's preventing the new births brother
[1:06:08] Caleb what is it a lot of unconfessed
[1:06:11] sin a lot of
[1:06:14] negativity a lot of things against one
[1:06:17] against the
[1:06:19] other speaking for myself but I made it
[1:06:23] right if I'm given the opportunity
[1:06:27] God allowed me a little bit more
[1:06:29] time you better believe I'm going to
[1:06:31] take
[1:06:34] it use these seven
[1:06:36] steps because it produces something and
[1:06:40] the message says that every seed bring
[1:06:43] forth of its
[1:06:45] kind so if it if if if it's an apple
[1:06:49] tree what does an apple tree
[1:06:51] produce it produces apples if we
[1:06:54] revolved off God
[1:06:56] God if we revolved off
[1:06:59] God then what should we be
[1:07:02] producing we are part of
[1:07:04] God then we'll produce exactly what
[1:07:07] Jesus Christ
[1:07:08] did or I will produce what Jesus Christ
[1:07:12] did and we like I said coming up on
[1:07:14] Easter we're gonna find out what he
[1:07:18] did so every seed is going to bring
[1:07:21] forth of its
[1:07:24] kind so
[1:07:26] why are so few new
[1:07:29] births I thought a lot about this when I
[1:07:31] was in the ncu in the
[1:07:35] hospital I had a lot of time to think
[1:07:37] there when my boys were in there for
[1:07:38] seven
[1:07:41] weeks and and I saw that even full-term
[1:07:47] babies needed
[1:07:49] assistance a lot of them couldn't
[1:07:51] breathe
[1:07:52] sister they were they were nine months
[1:07:54] they were born but they could breathe on
[1:07:56] their
[1:07:58] own they had to go into the ncu for
[1:08:03] assistance of course my boys boys were
[1:08:05] born in 31
[1:08:08] weeks so I got to see a lot of
[1:08:11] that they needed assistance
[1:08:15] breathing they needed a feeding
[1:08:18] tube they had to get their eyes
[1:08:21] checked they had to get their hearts
[1:08:23] checked get their brain checked
[1:08:27] and I would watch them and they would
[1:08:29] forget to
[1:08:31] breathe something essential to
[1:08:33] life but they would forget to
[1:08:36] breathe so that's why they were on the
[1:08:38] vapo machine I believe it's
[1:08:40] called and and it would do is it would
[1:08:42] force air into their lungs to remind
[1:08:46] them and I thought to
[1:08:48] myself I wonder if that's what's partly
[1:08:50] what's
[1:08:53] happening they needed the Nur
[1:08:57] assistance they needed the doctor's
[1:09:01] assistance they needed our
[1:09:04] assistance just to make it just to come
[1:09:09] to full
[1:09:10] term just to be
[1:09:13] normal I was thinking is I wonder if
[1:09:15] that happens a lot of
[1:09:17] times when we need to care for these
[1:09:20] babies coming
[1:09:22] in many times because of the time
[1:09:26] specialized treatment is
[1:09:29] needed that doesn't only fall on the
[1:09:32] pastor that doesn't fall in the pastor
[1:09:35] solely that falls in all of
[1:09:38] us because we've been in the message so
[1:09:41] long there's a lot of RN nurses and
[1:09:43] pediatricians and stuff
[1:09:47] here a lot of specialists in the
[1:09:50] word so was I was I was watching
[1:09:53] that and I was like wonder if wonder
[1:09:58] if amen amen you following
[1:10:01] me
[1:10:03] Sayan he uses all these things to scare
[1:10:05] us
[1:10:07] again he wants to suppress God's
[1:10:11] people God uses
[1:10:14] inflation to boost the bride's
[1:10:18] value so under God's inflation
[1:10:21] adjustment
[1:10:24] rate
[1:10:27] watch what he
[1:10:28] does brother Bram and now that's the
[1:10:32] kind of meeting we want to have every
[1:10:37] time I've preached to hundreds of
[1:10:40] thousands and I've preached just four or
[1:10:43] five but I wouldn't say I wouldn't be
[1:10:46] any more sincere with
[1:10:50] 500,000 than I would with five
[1:10:54] people because one soul is valued to
[1:10:58] God as 10,000
[1:11:01] worlds oh here comes the here's the
[1:11:03] contradiction here or what seems to be
[1:11:07] what
[1:11:08] happens the prophet being a
[1:11:11] Seer knowing the value at the end
[1:11:14] time all the prophets wanted to live in
[1:11:17] this
[1:11:18] time why because of the amount of value
[1:11:21] that was going to be
[1:11:23] placed brother brand
[1:11:26] with the watch the inflation adjustment
[1:11:28] rate that was
[1:11:32] 19554
[1:11:34] okay I was up at a big Museum not long
[1:11:37] ago and looking at some of the
[1:11:39] estimation of a man weighed 150
[1:11:44] pounds how much chemicals there was in
[1:11:47] his
[1:11:49] body you know how much there there is
[1:11:51] when he is all rendered
[1:11:54] up
[1:11:56] he's worth about about 84
[1:11:59] cents then you'll put a $10 hat on 84
[1:12:06] cents and a $500 mink
[1:12:10] coat and turn your nose
[1:12:12] up if it rained it would drown you and
[1:12:17] then go along taking care of that 84
[1:12:22] cents right thinking you're somebody
[1:12:26] and you don't you don't give a
[1:12:29] care you act like
[1:12:31] it about that Soul that's worth 10
[1:12:36] million the difference the rashly how
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:42] we Jesus keeps all his
[1:12:46] appointments so he cut
[1:12:49] time boosted your and I our
[1:12:53] value so it's not 10 th000 worlds
[1:12:57] anymore your value now is 10 million
[1:13:00] worlds if that doesn't make you
[1:13:03] shout that God would think that of you
[1:13:06] and
[1:13:07] I then nothing
[1:13:09] will amen amen he dries up our
[1:13:13] value except those days be
[1:13:18] shortened no no flesh would be
[1:13:21] saved all to Skyrocket our value
[1:13:26] homes have gone up in valy right brother
[1:13:27] David we're talking about the homes
[1:13:29] going up in
[1:13:31] value everything's more expensive right
[1:13:34] now at the end of the day am I
[1:13:37] contributing to the go to God's
[1:13:40] economy am I giving or
[1:13:42] taking am I adding
[1:13:45] value brother Bram a perfect
[1:13:48] man when a man possesses these kind of
[1:13:52] things then the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:13:54] him
[1:13:57] no matter you might speak with
[1:14:00] tongues you might impersonate any gift
[1:14:02] that God
[1:14:05] has you might do that but until these
[1:14:08] virtues
[1:14:10] here go into
[1:14:12] you you're still off the real true
[1:14:15] foundation of
[1:14:18] Faith but when these virtues grow
[1:14:22] in and you add it to that
[1:14:25] then you're a living
[1:14:28] Monument amen
[1:14:31] amen
[1:14:33] so I'll wind down here because I don't
[1:14:35] know how long I've been going
[1:14:37] but brother Bram
[1:14:40] says how could Our Testimony stand
[1:14:43] up to those that were re by
[1:14:47] lions at the
[1:14:49] steak oil in
[1:14:52] oil now if you look at it
[1:14:57] just if you look at it just like
[1:14:59] that oh yeah know hard testimony cannot
[1:15:02] stand up to I know no
[1:15:04] way but watch this
[1:15:07] angle I have to say
[1:15:09] Amen if I look at it pound for
[1:15:13] pound the to say it took them five
[1:15:15] minutes to get eaten whatever I mean
[1:15:16] which is
[1:15:20] not you look at it in five
[1:15:23] minutes to the five minutes the that we
[1:15:25] have
[1:15:27] endured with whatever
[1:15:29] issue no
[1:15:32] comparison no comparison at
[1:15:34] all but if I take those same five
[1:15:37] minutes and I compare them to
[1:15:40] somebody that's been going through
[1:15:43] something for the past 20
[1:15:46] years 30 years 10
[1:15:50] years which one is which one's
[1:15:54] harder
[1:15:57] I have to say Amen to the prophet
[1:16:00] amen minutes for five minutes of course
[1:16:02] not but you look at each person that has
[1:16:04] been standing
[1:16:07] here watch
[1:16:11] this those are terrible it's terrible
[1:16:13] what happens to
[1:16:15] them but for us to endure the 200,000
[1:16:18] thousand
[1:16:23] charges that we battle every single
[1:16:28] day those demons that hang heavy on
[1:16:31] you on your thoughts on your emotions on
[1:16:36] your body for years I'll tell you one
[1:16:40] thing the enemy is
[1:16:42] wondering how in the world you're still
[1:16:46] standing he he he doesn't know what to
[1:16:48] do with it is that when he has thrown
[1:16:50] all
[1:16:52] this you do the math of 200,000,000
[1:16:59] Chargers against the
[1:17:01] bride and it's like I didn't do the math
[1:17:04] do the
[1:17:06] math but what she has to endure every
[1:17:09] single
[1:17:10] day like I said I don't go very far you
[1:17:12] look at our
[1:17:14] pastor you look at our pastor I don't
[1:17:16] have to go very
[1:17:18] far the load that he
[1:17:21] carries the load that brother brother
[1:17:23] long has carried
[1:17:27] Tommy Jimmy
[1:17:29] Jerry the load we have to
[1:17:33] end each and every one of you Brother
[1:17:36] Carlos martinz back
[1:17:38] there he's been sick and look at
[1:17:40] him it amazes
[1:17:42] me that he will not miss
[1:17:45] church to see brother re come up and
[1:17:47] sing a
[1:17:50] special wow that blew me
[1:17:53] away but it shows the value of the Bride
[1:17:56] today it shows that she's willing to
[1:18:01] endure all these
[1:18:03] demons why because she's gotus sayth the
[1:18:07] lord it's inside of her right now now
[1:18:11] we'll have it he has it right
[1:18:14] now who is it that's inside of
[1:18:17] you who is it that dwells inside
[1:18:22] of who is at the table to do these
[1:18:24] things
[1:18:26] you see brother pray for the
[1:18:29] people you see you see our
[1:18:31] pastor pretty much every
[1:18:34] category brother Loreno is
[1:18:37] singing no one moves ACR like brother
[1:18:39] Tommy J songmy J Brother Carlos Hill the
[1:18:43] way he
[1:18:45] teaches brother Daniel brother Abraham I
[1:18:47] mention
[1:18:50] everybody why there's value today
[1:18:54] there's value today and the enem is
[1:18:57] wondering how because we have each other
[1:19:01] because he'll defeat Us by ourselves
[1:19:03] he'll defeat Us by
[1:19:05] ourselves but but together he can't
[1:19:08] touch us the Holy Spirit back in
[1:19:13] Pentecost it broke into into
[1:19:17] pieces but today it's coming back
[1:19:22] together you believe that that's how
[1:19:24] endure the
[1:19:27] floods
[1:19:29] so watch this let me I'll read this and
[1:19:32] I'll finish with
[1:19:36] this I tell each and person here every
[1:19:39] person standing here right
[1:19:43] now you have stood in the lines
[1:19:46] then you have endured the
[1:19:49] floods you have waited 25
[1:19:52] years you have come through the fire
[1:19:56] you have been
[1:19:57] resurrected he says well for example
[1:20:00] Abraham waited 25
[1:20:03] years for a child what if I tell you
[1:20:07] that I waited just as
[1:20:09] long he waited 25 years I waited 16
[1:20:14] years but under the inflation and
[1:20:16] adjustment
[1:20:19] rate it's the same time and it's worth
[1:20:22] more
[1:20:23] today because of everything that we've
[1:20:26] had
[1:20:27] to through all hell against
[1:20:30] us the devil is wondering how you're
[1:20:34] standing how do these young people
[1:20:37] stand how is it
[1:20:40] possible because we have each
[1:20:42] other and because we're
[1:20:44] taught not to have the word only but
[1:20:47] that word has to
[1:20:49] produce and it's producing in each and
[1:20:51] every one of you we are a special class
[1:20:54] of
[1:20:57] not only because we hear the
[1:20:59] best but we're able to understand
[1:21:02] it digest it and
[1:21:06] produce and give to God's
[1:21:09] economy add value to the
[1:21:11] economy to make the adjustment in your
[1:21:14] own
[1:21:15] life whatever you've been going
[1:21:18] through it's it's
[1:21:21] amazing even to the point where all the
[1:21:24] prophets they wanted to live in this
[1:21:26] time because it was going to be worth so
[1:21:29] much
[1:21:30] more under the adjustment
[1:21:34] rate under the
[1:21:37] reevaluation you're worth more than 10
[1:21:39] million
[1:21:41] world he jump from not 10,000 he says it
[1:21:45] 37 times that's
[1:21:47] okay but for this time he said it seven
[1:21:52] times 10 million worlds
[1:21:56] if the musician would
[1:22:07] come now produce you give it the
[1:22:10] opportunity

[1:22:15] your life right
[1:22:17] now the young people and we always
[1:22:20] say I'm not going to sit here and say
[1:22:22] you're having a hard time you're not
[1:22:23] having a hard time
[1:22:27] you have the ability to
[1:22:29] produce given the opportunity
[1:22:33] to we're gonna like I said if you if you
[1:22:37] have a need how many have a
[1:22:39] need do you feel you need
[1:22:42] something maybe I haven't maybe I felt
[1:22:45] like I haven't been
[1:22:47] producing maybe I haven't been producing
[1:22:50] enough right all you have to do
[1:22:53] surrender yourself
[1:22:56] it's as simple as
[1:22:58] that but that's the word you heard
[1:23:00] me can't stay with that
[1:23:03] word you got to do something with
[1:23:05] it and now it's in your hands but I'll
[1:23:09] tell you one thing the amount of
[1:23:11] purchasing power in your hands right
