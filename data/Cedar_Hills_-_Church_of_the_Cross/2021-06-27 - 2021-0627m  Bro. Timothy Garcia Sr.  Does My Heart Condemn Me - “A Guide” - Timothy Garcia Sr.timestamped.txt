[49:35] and whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[49:38] because we keep his commandments and do
[49:41] those things that are pleasing in his
[49:43] sight
[49:53] may the lord add his blessings to the
[49:54] reading of his words
[50:05] i put for a title this morning
[50:08] does my heart condemn me me condensate
[50:12] and with a thought and and i took this
[50:15] from the message that brother branham
[50:16] spoke
[50:22] and while i'm speaking this morning ask
[50:23] yourself that question
[50:38] a
[50:52] and how to take care of you along the
[50:54] road
[50:57] see he's got to see that you don't come
[51:00] up lost
[51:03] a guide is a selected man
[51:29] what about the guy that the holy ghost
[51:32] has chosen to be your past
[51:33] okay delhi
[51:58] and there i was still in the same
[52:00] condition
[52:08] and to me that was good enough
[52:14] i know brother branham says brother
[52:15] brandon said in the message there's only
[52:16] one way provided by god for anything
[52:24] we can never enter the house of the lord
[52:26] and go out the same lupu
[52:55] what condition are you in this morning
[53:02] had the privilege of listening to
[53:03] brother diego speak he will pre-release
[53:06] online in the internet
[53:10] and he had mentioned about the vision
[53:13] they had about the white bag
[53:18] you mentioned how the bag is white on
[53:21] the outside
[53:24] but full of trash on the inside
[53:30] that really hit home for me
[53:33] [Music]
[53:36] because that was the condition that i
[53:38] found myself
[53:42] because i refuse to follow the
[53:46] instructions
[53:46] of the guide the secure instructions
[53:50] as much as he would preach
[53:56] to me it didn't matter important
[54:01] i thought i was okay just going to
[54:02] church
[54:06] so i asked myself the question is
[54:15] brother branham in the message as i
[54:17] thought on my way
[54:21] in el camino
[54:24] he says it's usually when a man gets in
[54:26] trouble that he will turn to god
[54:32] you see it's where it's when we're in
[54:35] trouble
[54:36] then we begin to think about god
[54:42] when israel got in trouble when they had
[54:44] forsaken god
[54:48] and went off after iron
[54:52] and done things they should not do it
[54:56] then they turned to god and cried out
[55:01] and then the strange thing the strange
[55:02] thing that was with
[55:04] israel
[55:11] god will come to their rescue
[55:14] and then when it's all over you they
[55:17] forget all about it
[55:21] i know that's the way i used to be jose
[55:23] cassie
[55:25] lord if you help me from this i promise
[55:29] i'll do this i'll do that agua
[55:32] i'll serve you the suitable and how fast
[55:37] i forgot my promises
[55:41] i remember my dad used to say a lot
[55:43] record
[55:47] when he was talking about someone in the
[55:48] flesh
[55:51] is he a friend in need
[55:57] or is he a friend indeed
[56:02] so you stop and ask yourself that
[56:05] question this morning
[56:09] is jesus your friend in need is jesus
[56:14] or is jesus your friend indeed jesus
[56:19] you know because it's always easy
[56:23] to praise god
[56:27] to worship god
[56:33] but you know he doesn't allow it like
[56:35] that all the time
[56:38] because we know that we all must be
[56:40] tested
[56:46] and that's usually during those times we
[56:49] forget
[56:53] who he is so is he
[56:56] your friend in need
[57:00] or is he your friend indeed
[57:06] brother branham said in the message as i
[57:08] thought on my way this
[57:10] is
[57:22] it isn't good to wait until we get in
[57:25] trouble
[57:28] and then see god it's best to find him
[57:32] now
[57:34] for it is written that he is a very
[57:37] present help
[57:38] he
[57:53] and the very present help in time of
[57:54] trouble yes
[57:58] i was listening to a couple messages
[58:00] that brother branham was talking about
[58:02] going hunting
[58:06] is
[58:09] and when i heard he was in one of the
[58:11] ones in the messenger guide
[58:17] i got a kick out of how he said he
[58:18] cheated on his wife
[58:35] you know right away you hear that
[58:40] and i won't say what but you can imagine
[58:42] what's the first thing that comes to
[58:43] most people's minds
[58:46] but he was talking about when he got
[58:49] married
[58:52] the same time that the lord told him to
[58:54] get married
[58:57] it was hunting season so he was going to
[59:00] kill two birds with one stone this is
[59:14] so he told her you stay here i'm gonna
[59:16] go get
[59:17] go hunting for now
[59:22] and it got to the point that after he
[59:26] got his elk i believe it was it is
[59:32] he knew it was getting late he had to
[59:34] get back to his
[59:35] his wife and brother billy paul when he
[59:38] was about five years old
[59:44] and he got lost
[59:47] and he was what the indians called on
[59:51] a death walk he was just walking around
[59:53] in circles
[1:00:00] he was trying to bluff it by telling
[1:00:02] himself that he was too good of a hunter
[1:00:04] to get lost
[1:00:10] and in the message
[1:00:55] something inside of you tells you you're
[1:00:57] wrong
[1:01:01] see you know if you die
[1:01:04] you couldn't meet a holy god
[1:01:17] me personally personally i used to think
[1:01:22] i used to think yo pinchawa that
[1:01:25] you know i could fool my wife
[1:01:30] i could form my pastor pastor my parents
[1:01:33] his fathers the brothers and sisters in
[1:01:35] the church hermanos hermanos and iglesia
[1:01:51] my heart was condemning me
[1:01:56] and you can't love god either
[1:02:01] god knows the very deepest thoughts of
[1:02:04] your heart
[1:02:13] i'll be reading matthew 12 43-45
[1:02:32] cinco
[1:02:34] this was personal for me
[1:02:39] and i spoke about it once
[1:02:46] occasionally i had an addiction where i
[1:02:49] struggled for over 30 years
[1:02:53] and i'll go a little bit more into
[1:02:55] detail but let's read the scripture
[1:02:58] when the unclean spirit is gone out of a
[1:02:59] man he walketh through dry places
[1:03:02] seeking rest
[1:03:02] and find if none for the spirit
[1:03:09] then he saith i'll re i will return into
[1:03:11] my house from once i came out
[1:03:13] and when he has come he finds it empty
[1:03:16] swept
[1:03:16] and garnished
[1:03:25] then he goeth and taken take it with
[1:03:28] himself seven other spirits
[1:03:29] more wicked than himself
[1:03:36] and they enter in and dwell there
[1:03:41] and the last state of the man is worse
[1:03:43] than the first
[1:03:45] vienna primero even so shall it be unto
[1:03:48] this wicked generation
[1:03:53] that's the way i was at one point in my
[1:03:56] life
[1:04:10] you
[1:04:12] and the crazy thing is
[1:04:16] yeah that's a good word he would help me
[1:04:21] he would deliver me in liberal
[1:04:31] because the unclean spirit as it says in
[1:04:32] verse 43 the unclean spirit was gone out
[1:04:36] of three mundo
[1:04:40] but i would never pick up my bible
[1:04:45] i would never read it much less read it
[1:04:47] if i don't pick it up how am i going to
[1:04:48] read it
[1:04:53] i wouldn't go to the tape no iva a la
[1:04:55] cintas
[1:04:56] wouldn't listen to brother branham let's
[1:04:58] go challenge
[1:05:00] all i would do is go to church on sunday
[1:05:06] morning
[1:05:08] i was trying to bluff myself thinking by
[1:05:10] coming to church that i was okay
[1:05:16] so that was the first thing from the
[1:05:20] truth
[1:05:38] i used to try to bluff myself
[1:05:44] because during the service do not tell
[1:05:46] servicio
[1:05:48] during the worship
[1:05:54] i would praise god but that was the
[1:05:57] furthest thing from the truth
[1:06:01] that's right brother branham said in the
[1:06:03] voice of god in the last days
[1:06:08] you can't base your eternal destination
[1:06:10] upon some sensation
[1:06:16] satan can impersonate any of those
[1:06:18] sensations
[1:06:22] it's to know christ
[1:06:25] and watch your life and pattern pattern
[1:06:27] it with
[1:06:28] the word evil is
[1:06:45] he found my house empty in control
[1:06:50] in garnet
[1:06:55] and then i would pray to the lord to
[1:06:56] help me also
[1:07:11] in second peter 2 22 segundo de pedro
[1:07:14] dos ventidos
[1:07:18] but it happened unto them according to
[1:07:20] the true proverb
[1:07:25] the dog is turned to his own vomit again
[1:07:29] and the sow that was washed into her
[1:07:31] wallowing in the mire
[1:07:36] proverbs 26 11.
[1:07:40] say
[1:07:45] as a dog return it through his vomit
[1:07:50] so a full return it to his folly
[1:08:23] but you know we get to a point in our
[1:08:24] life we want god to do everything
[1:08:30] i wanted god to do everything
[1:08:36] in romans 12 1 in romano
[1:08:42] he says i beseech you therefore brethren
[1:08:45] by the mercies of god that ye present
[1:08:47] your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:08:49] holy acceptable acceptable unto god
[1:08:52] which is your reasonable service
[1:08:56] record
[1:09:04] rationale so with me wanting god to do
[1:09:07] everything
[1:09:10] but what did i do to change but okay
[1:09:14] nothing
[1:09:18] the last part of revelation 19 7.
[1:09:23] it says and his wife has made herself
[1:09:26] ready
[1:09:30] you know we have something to do also
[1:09:47] it said she made herself ready
[1:09:53] so many says if the lord will take this
[1:09:56] evil spirit from me
[1:10:00] from drinking or from gambling or from
[1:10:02] lying or stealing
[1:10:05] i'll serve him that was me
[1:10:10] but that's up to you too
[1:10:13] you got to do something too that's right
[1:10:18] it says they that overcome shall inherit
[1:10:21] all things
[1:10:24] they that overcome
[1:10:28] you have power to do it
[1:10:31] but you must be willing to lay it down
[1:10:36] see she made herself ready
[1:10:40] i like that word you see god could not
[1:10:44] push us through a little pipe
[1:10:49] pull us out the other end
[1:10:52] and then saying blessed is he that
[1:10:55] overcome
[1:10:56] bentito es el
[1:10:57] [Applause]
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:30] you know my problem was thinking that
[1:11:32] coming to church
[1:11:36] that was good enough
[1:12:07] of course he was going to find my my
[1:12:09] house in that condition
[1:12:15] you know satan is very sneaky
[1:12:19] you know a lot of times he'll say it's
[1:12:22] okay to do something which is visiting
[1:12:26] it's just this it's okay but you know
[1:12:30] one thing leads to another
[1:12:34] that's right man
[1:12:38] and there came a point in my life where
[1:12:40] i finally had it now
[1:12:46] to me i believe that's where when god
[1:12:48] really comes on the scene
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:13:00] your worst and your lowest point in your
[1:13:02] life
[1:13:07] he didn't meet the three hebrew children
[1:13:10] before they went into the fiery furnace
[1:13:12] on the ramp to get there
[1:13:16] and
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:30] when i finally had enough
[1:13:36] you know you can feel
[1:13:39] when there's that deep that's pulling
[1:13:43] you know when jesus is calling you jesus
[1:13:48] or when there's a deep that calls
[1:13:53] there's a deep that will respond
[1:13:57] and one sunday morning
[1:14:05] and you know god works on both ends
[1:14:12] so when i felt that the lord was calling
[1:14:16] me
[1:14:19] i got up to go to the altar
[1:14:22] but i thought for a second
[1:14:26] to go the other way
[1:14:32] and i chose to go to the altar
[1:14:35] and i didn't care what anybody thought
[1:14:39] i didn't care
[1:14:54] i was embarrassed to worship the lord
[1:15:01] i used to think what is this person
[1:15:04] going to say
[1:15:06] what is the next person going to say is
[1:15:22] he can
[1:15:30] so as i was as i when i went to the
[1:15:32] altar to pray when the free
[1:15:38] i was pouring my heart out to the lord
[1:15:44] and i do remember it that
[1:15:48] one brother came vino hermano and prayed
[1:15:51] for me europor me
[1:15:52] prayed with me and i recognized his
[1:15:56] voice
[1:15:56] irregular and afterwards
[1:15:59] i went to him and i asked him
[1:16:03] if that was him
[1:16:07] and he told me that the holy spirit sent
[1:16:08] him holy spirit
[1:16:14] because the lord knew
[1:16:17] that that was my day of deliverance
[1:16:23] but had i gone the other way
[1:16:28] i wouldn't be here this morning i know
[1:16:31] that
[1:16:32] you say so
[1:16:46] [Music]
[1:17:10] we will all know
[1:17:16] you guys are so blessed
[1:17:21] to have a pastor that you have
[1:17:25] the ministry that you have
[1:17:41] he's going to give you your exodus
[1:17:45] and he's going to put you in a place
[1:17:46] that you never thought you would be you
[1:17:48] know
[1:17:55] and i don't know if i mentioned this
[1:17:56] earlier
[1:17:59] but i am home this morning
[1:18:08] well i was preparing for this message
[1:18:41] and when we went to
[1:18:44] sister marie's house when the famous la
[1:18:47] casa del mar marie
[1:18:48] and they started to practice that song
[1:18:52] i was sitting in the kitchen
[1:18:55] table having a cup of coffee
[1:19:01] and when i heard them start to sing that
[1:19:02] song
[1:19:05] i almost jumped
[1:19:17] and when we i got home or on the way
[1:19:19] home the regresso
[1:19:28] and she said that the lord had placed it
[1:19:30] upon her heart
[1:19:34] it is god working on both him
[1:19:40] i remember one day being somewhere that
[1:19:42] i should not have been
[1:19:47] doing something that i should not have
[1:19:48] been doing
[1:19:52] and there's probably a couple people
[1:19:57] that know this
[1:20:00] but there i found myself staring down
[1:20:02] the barrel of a gun
[1:20:11] you might say you're lucky to be alive
[1:20:16] has nothing to do
[1:20:21] [Music]
[1:20:30] and that i would be
[1:20:58] so don't look at beauty it's correct
[1:21:01] look at truth media
[1:21:04] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:21:08] it's jumping for beauty
[1:21:11] and die
[1:21:18] john 17 17 says
[1:21:22] sanctify them through thy truth
[1:21:26] thy
[1:21:38] he said submit yourselves therefore to
[1:21:40] god
[1:21:54] he will walk away from me he says
[1:21:58] he will stay there resist the devil
[1:22:03] and he will flee
[1:22:09] but you know if you stop to think about
[1:22:10] it
[1:22:12] how's the devil ever going to flee
[1:22:17] if we first don't submit ourselves to
[1:22:18] god
[1:22:22] and then if we submit ourselves to god
[1:22:26] are we resisting the devil
[1:22:31] remember the question
[1:22:34] does my heart condemn me
[1:22:37] are we resisting god are we resisting
[1:22:40] the devil
[1:22:45] or we wanting god to do everything
[1:22:49] you know we find ourselves in in a bad
[1:22:52] situation
[1:22:56] laura i need your help please help me
[1:23:02] there with the remote watching tv
[1:23:04] control
[1:23:06] or doing something other than
[1:23:10] seeking him
[1:23:14] reading a magazine or reading a book the
[1:23:17] endo libro una revista
[1:23:43] in second corinthians 4 16 second
[1:23:47] yes he corinthians
[1:24:08] but the bible says for ye are the temple
[1:24:10] of the living god this is
[1:24:25] i remember when brother abraham was
[1:24:27] speaking last week
[1:25:11] trying to make yourself go to hell
[1:25:16] and then say god's good and won't send
[1:25:17] me send you to hell
[1:25:21] you're right you're sending yourself
[1:25:44] that's right
[1:25:49] i remember one of the hardest things
[1:25:50] that i had to do
[1:25:54] you know as a teenager a young adult it
[1:25:57] was after
[1:25:57] my wife and i got married
[1:26:06] one of the hardest things for me to do
[1:26:07] was stop going to
[1:26:09] friends people that i knew or grew up
[1:26:12] with
[1:26:19] because i was able to get access to
[1:26:22] things that i knew i should not have
[1:26:24] been doing
[1:26:26] it
[1:26:29] it was like a candy store
[1:26:34] whatever i wanted to do it was there
[1:26:37] establishing but you know that's where
[1:26:41] brother bran says we have to do
[1:26:42] something ourselves
[1:26:47] how are we going to submit ourselves
[1:26:49] unto god
[1:26:53] myself and then still week after week
[1:26:57] after week after week go to that
[1:27:00] person's house
[1:27:09] second corinthians 6 segundo corinthians
[1:27:12] says
[1:27:13] verse 14 versus
[1:27:58] the temple of god with idols
[1:28:04] for ye are the temples of the living god
[1:28:08] as god has said i will dwell in them
[1:28:13] and walk in them
[1:28:16] i will be their god and they shall be my
[1:28:19] people
[1:28:21] amen wherefore come out from among them
[1:28:36] and i will receive
[1:28:47] i was talking to a brother one time
[1:28:51] and he was telling me how
[1:28:56] he was sober and he gave me the years
[1:28:59] that he was sober
[1:29:03] los angeles
[1:29:17] [Music]
[1:29:30] because once the lord took that away
[1:29:33] from me
[1:29:41] in the message the invisible union of
[1:29:42] the bride with christ
[1:29:46] the word justified is though you've
[1:29:48] never done it
[1:29:53] amen amen it's not even regarded at all
[1:29:56] in god's book
[1:30:01] your old book and marriage is divorced
[1:30:05] and dead
[1:30:08] and it's not even in the memories of god
[1:30:10] initiative
[1:30:12] therefore being justified justification
[1:30:14] you never done it
[1:30:15] in the first place he wasn't married to
[1:30:19] it to begin with
[1:30:22] he the bridegroom for your shame
[1:30:27] he took your place he took my place
[1:30:32] where you were predestinated for him
[1:30:36] to be his bride
[1:30:40] before the foundation of the world
[1:30:44] isn't god good nos dios buenos
[1:30:48] [Applause]
[1:31:28] but
[1:31:30] where do you find yourself this morning
[1:31:36] you can ask yourself that question
[1:31:40] does my heart condemn me
[1:31:53] i remember the message not sure what the
[1:31:55] name was
[1:31:56] the title of brother brandon's message
[1:32:02] but the holy spirit was dealing with the
[1:32:05] young lady at the time
[1:32:09] and brother brown
[1:32:25] she told him that i would get somebody
[1:32:27] with more sense
[1:32:31] and that he embarrassed her
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:37] you know years later he saw her on the
[1:32:39] street in in the condition that
[1:32:41] she was in illegal angels
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:47] she was lost forever she said she could
[1:32:50] see her mother's
[1:32:51] soul fry in hell like a pancake and
[1:32:53] laugh at it
[1:33:01] and you know we can cross that line
[1:33:07] right i am just grateful this morning
[1:33:11] that he gave me a chance
[1:33:20] i'll read this one last quote in closing
[1:33:24] the choosing of a bribe
[1:33:27] your eternal destination is a choice
[1:33:33] there'll be one time that if you turn
[1:33:35] god down many times
[1:33:40] there will be one time you'll turn him
[1:33:42] down for the last time
[1:33:47] there is a line between mercy and
[1:33:48] judgment
[1:33:52] and it's a dangerous thing for a man or
[1:33:53] woman
[1:33:56] boy or girl across that line
[1:34:00] for there's no return
[1:34:16] a great power
[1:34:20] to me that's one of my favorite songs
[1:34:25] how great that word
[1:34:30] hallelujah
[1:34:34] with our heads bowed this morning
[1:34:42] lord you remember heavenly father
[1:34:46] father celestia you remember lord when
[1:34:51] i spoke this message in church one year
[1:34:58] iglesia
[1:35:03] it was probably one of the hardest
[1:35:04] things
[1:35:06] that i had to admit
[1:35:14] but lord it was you speaking
[1:35:21] and i didn't think it mattered to anyone
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:34] i went to one of the meetings in mexico
[1:35:37] i'm not sure where it was guadalajara i
[1:35:39] believe
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:52] [Music]
[1:35:55] me
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:35:58] i was blown away
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:04] that he said he struggled with the same
[1:36:08] addiction
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:21] just as well as he'll attack the
[1:36:22] ministry
[1:36:27] and he told me that it had an impact on
[1:36:29] his life
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:35] and if it was only for one person
[1:36:39] there were others aviano but for me to
[1:36:43] know that
[1:36:43] it was the minister
[1:36:47] shook me to my car message
[1:36:55] knowing that this problem was more
[1:36:57] rampant for
[1:36:59] to even think that there was such a
[1:37:00] problem like that
[1:37:04] [Music]
[1:37:12] [Music]
[1:37:16] and you took me out from the filth that
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:31] and it's only because of grace
