virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel Isaiah 9:6 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace [Applause] about two thousand years ago in Nazareth lived a young lady named Mary Mary was to be married to Joseph a carpenter one night God sent his angel Gabriel to talk to Mary Gabriel tells Mary she is highly favored and blessed among women he tells her the Holy Ghost shall come upon you and you shall bear the Son of God his name shall be Jesus later an angel the Lord also came to Joseph in a dream to confirm what Mary had experienced close to the time that Jesus was to be born Mary and Joseph how to travel back to where Joseph was from to pay taxes so they packed up and set out for Bethlehem but when they got there everywhere was full and there was no room for them so they eventually find room in a manger and shortly after Mary gave birth to baby Jesus not far away were Shepherds watching over their flock that night and an angel came to them saying unto you a savior is born which is Christ the Lord you will find him wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger suddenly there was a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God so the Shepherd's hurry to Bethlehem to see the baby and tell everyone what they had heard and seen meanwhile thousands of miles away were three astronomers they were very wise because they had been following a heavenly star that told of the birth of the new king they traveled far and wide for two whole years up mountains may be hot nights or cold nights through winds and storms maybe even pounding rings okay okay we got a little carried away when the wise men finally reached Bethlehem they round the streets looking for the newborn king but they found themselves standing before a different King King Herod Herod had no idea about this new king and he started to get worried that he would soon be replaced so he tried getting more information from the wise men but they were too well wise for that so Herod had an idea and he sought to destroy baby Jesus by getting rid of all the babies two years old and under finally the star appeared before the wise men signalling where the Messiah was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy they each went over to Jesus with gifts to pay their respects to our God who had been born a man through virgin birth in order to save us all [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] stars shine
