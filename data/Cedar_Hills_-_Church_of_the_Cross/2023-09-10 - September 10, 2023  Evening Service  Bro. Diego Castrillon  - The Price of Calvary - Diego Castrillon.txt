the microphone from him like to take the opportunity to to thank the Lord I've never been more happy in my life than today and I'll tell you why opportunity I'd like to think take the opportunity to thank my pastor to allow me to stand behind this this precious place and allow me to to say some words the most valuable purchase that our Lord Jesus Christ has that says beloved bride our lord is good and we can reopen up our Bibles in the Book of John chapter 3 verse 16. foreign [Music] as we read in John 3 16. you say we could say this by memory [Music] it says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and we'll read it again wait that brother Branham taught us to read the Bible the way your pastor reminded us how we should be reading the Bible and put your name there for God so loved Noah 's mask one more time that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life let us pray Lord good evening Lord here we are trembling and with fear Lord at the same time we are emotional because you're present it's real in this hour Lord we've read this precious word Lord Quicken and break the bread this hour that we can recognize that it is Lord one more time in our midst of you be the glory in the name of our Lord Jesus you may take your seats everyone that's your presence I'd like to thank you it's time that you come to church the fact that you come sit down in that seat you are telling Satan what side you are on or perhaps celebrating a certain activity when you should be at church and you don't come to church then you are telling God uh that uh God what side you're on so it says it's important so it is important foreign I ask that you may have a little bit of patience I do not have a clear or direct message I like to speak about faith I like to to speak about healings because I can increase the faith of the people but what God has given me in this hour I want to give it in the way that he gave it to me I was speaking yesterday or perhaps you might may have been on Friday with a brother from Ukraine and he was asking how many brothers were going to go to the convention there in Poland is and I was explaining to him about this many are going and he says I said brother I already went what do you mean you you came already but yes brother I went he comes yes and I began to explain to him come on yes 10 11 years ago each time that my past each time he goes to a missionary trip foreign I can see problems that are happening and when I return it's for the benefit of the people when I began to tell these things to this brother there's some people that say well that's fine I believe it I want to hear more when he said that I said my friend we need to pray because this trip of our pastor going to Poland it's not just any trips it is awaiting a Revival and we need to to catch that plan catch the plan and the purpose to be able to follow that plan I said my friends I also see Satan the makeup position and I began to explain how God was showing us foreign how Satan was going to face our pastor in this group that we're taking the gospel not in words the fire of God to be able to light up is he was I was telling him these things how the enemy was going to make our position and this brother he took a lot of things out is we just need to find one man we need to find one passage who I saw in a business as soon as that the people can enter to here an Apostolic that'll be the sign so that what God placed in this man foreign when I heard that on Wednesday I went to go cry cry to pray and to cry I said Lord they were waiting for Diego to go Diego goes Diego can I help them I need you I want them to see you I want them to be able to see that Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever and I began to pray a precious friend calls me to invite me to go eat to stay at a hotel that's great but until guys I was not going to leave my house I needed God to speak I needed to be guided I needed to know the will of God we're the precious people in El Paso the price of the cross and it wasn't until Sunday morning God in his grace had pleased him to show me what his will was and when you do the will when you were a Son of God you have been called not to do your way but to do God's will yes which is uh it is wholly acceptable and it's perfect when I stood up there I could tell the people how the Holy Spirit was going to begin to minister and it was a Revival now a Revival it is not to dance those are the results be reconnected and the tears Begin to Fall that is a Revival the price of the cross the Holy Spirit begins to call out diseases this morning Holy Spirit showed me how did they get there these men these climbers they climb Mount these mountains and sometimes they reach a place a point where they can't go forward they can't but they're going to die pero from the price of the cross when I saw this scene I said how did they get there by their decision and I remembered they interviewed a very famous man yesterday I'm going around he said friend like flowers what is the key to your success the people were awaiting something great and he just says good decisions all of you well that's obvious if there would have been bad decisions they were good decisions and he still speaks through his through his son tells me of his church amen but there's people that live as repel did not exist I'm speaking to Christians hey cristianos there's Christians that live as if hell was something that was not in the bible let me tell you it's so real when he was here more about hell and about heaven took me to these Caverns that are below the Earth that you cannot go out out of these demons what were they planning is when I was a child acted like a child yeah and I did the things of a child now that I've left the things now that I'm a man when we're children Brothers you know the children you let the children lose you can't tell them come over here because they don't understand their children your children they fight because they're children the children they suffer with Envy Caleb we're going to find when when you go to when we go to Poland and this is what Satan is going to do this is his plan we have to pray we have to pass to counteract his plan but let me tell you Caleb okay well demand from us a spiritual maturity of God in Holiness so they never will you criticize I saw people they need a miracles look brother I've never spoken these things and if you suddenly hear me speaking them today and you're a child you're putting yourself in a position you're being inspired to know yes that if God speaks [Music] and you have a right to know and the will of God for your life the price of the cross do you know why we act this way Joe B I saw I said three months back I saw the revivalists that the bride is is waiting for eign I speak what I see I saw it when I saw it Carlos when I saw this I I saw this flame burn in this house and I said we need to call the firefighters there was no firefighter and I said why isn't it burning why doesn't this house burn when I put my hand it didn't burn a Revival when I understood there's no demon in hell that can turn It Off three times that I've been living here in the United States three times one time in Colombia four times but here I am because I've been able to tell the devil yes until God uh ends with my life I'm going to stand for God when I stand for you for years that's my life the price of the Cross you know brother when my pastor told me I want you to go to Tucson I I was afraid because a year ago I was there when I was at the hotel Henry for the Henry I was in a hotel there in Tucson the the principle uh diabolic that governs uh Tucson that devil visited me in in the at the hotel and I could discern him I could I knew how he acted is something terrible to be there you don't want to have those kinds of experiences pastor is my pastor told me I want you to to go to Tucson the young people are going to have a a meeting my children are teenagers to have an encounter with the Lord so I began to pray and I began to fast weeks the presence of God in that meeting wow I I never have experienced the presence of Lord when ministers preach we have enjoyed it Saturday evening there is no preaching there was two testimonies of two young young people and the Revival Los Angeles the angels and I said Lord foreign [Applause] [Music] the price of the cross when we're children we act like children you know me I saw the people need God they need him they know if not I see that you'll die I could be spiritual or natural yes so that you cry out my question is foreign he is and there was
