[Music] oh [Music] good evening friends when i started god bless you yes it's such a great privilege for me to be here i have to say i i feel like like i know you so well because every morning in my kitchen back in norway in in so for me to this is [Applause] what i've been looking at on the screen for 14 months okay i'm now a part of yo [Music] in person in persona not only through the screen i spent quite a long time up in the forest that he may oh my way for me because what i've been receiving from this church has did great things to my life i chose thank you for for uh the way you are receiving me and not only brother canada and thank you brother for the confidence let me use your puppet and once again i i want to thank you for being here foreign because i want to go to the kitchen i want to turn on my ipad and start dining so i believe in the leading of the holy ghost that he the lord himself he makes a wave or it seems to be no way el apareja camino so i want to bring you greetings from norway we are just a little group of believers um so we are truly truly blessed so it's amazing it's algo tremendo how the lord is working in both ends cumberland senor ovra in ambus lados but we also have a great desert in norway did you know that a desert well then the nature is very nice there is a lot of forests we have yours animals you have yours that go from the sea and costas so there is a need are you [Music] that there's a window open for you you can travel to las vegas and i also have a great privilege here when i met him for the first time and i remember brother fabio he said record fabio dijo from the pulpit is del purpito but he said brother martin luther morton you are spanish it is espanola but still i i will share some of the word a portion of the word with you uh so and i also want to thank my brother henry hello aggressive henry who you know a preacher without a good interpreter he's like [Music] so as you heard my my english is not my modern language so please uh bear over with me consider me thinking i try my best so please turn with me to the book of genesis chapter 12. the liberal of the hennessey's we will read from from verse 1 rewards verse 4 and verse 2 jesus name now the lord has said had said unto abraham get the oath of thy country and from thy kingdom and from my father's house and to a land that i will and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and though shall be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that cursed thee and indeed shall all families of the earth be blessed familiar so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and not went with him and abraham was 75 years old when he departed out of haran [Music] well it must have been a really special experience when the lord starts speaking to abraham and he tells abraham to to leave his country and he he said that he would make him a great nation i believe that abraham he had a great expectation and i have great expectations grand expectations and expectation expectativa is very important because in for the lord to be able to give something to me we must have expectations but the question is actually everything and that that's very often very difficult for you and me yes when we have and that's the reality is in the walk with the lord in the caminar el senor if we want something from the lord there is a prize to pay i impress you okay and the question is am i willing to and that was the greatest prize ever yeah and he had to pay that price in order to redeem you and me so the lord he called abraham but he also called you and me to get out of our country and our own things then to get out of our own kind of kingdom in order to enter god's kingdom let's go to genesis chapter 15. verse 1 through 3 verse this is some time later day after these things the word of the lord came unto abraham in a vision saying hear not abraham i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward grande and abraham said lord god what will thou give me seeing i go silence and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus yes and abraham said behold to me though has given no seed and lo one born in my house that and to ask the lord in the padilla senor what will you give me possible when he received that great promise it seems like abraham kind of was losing his wisdom to his reason yeah because without a wisdom the people will perish you know so he started with a kind of uh confession that you haven't given me any see and in that condition condition it's so easy to get influenced by other kinds of spirits because the satan himself he can make himself like an angel that's the reason we must keep the vision fresh but the question is how to do that it is by leaving our own kingdom it's by leaving the handle and stay in god's kingdom be a heavenly places not once a week no now not that every con winston but no not at every convention we must hit ourselves you see abraham he still had some kind of some kind of expectation but it was on the wrong basis because he started forgetting about the promise episode and if we forget the promise he says our expectations will be on the wrong basis we will have wrong kind of expectations of each other then that um my brother also or the brothers and uh sister was nice to pick me up at the airports have a little house [Applause] so they brought me there or actually i i stayed there but the first night i stayed at the hotel in the morning in la manana about half past six media i was so hungry so i went down to find some breakfast but you know the breakfast was a little bit too light for and there it popped up it was called cracker barrel cracker barrel 90 meters away and um what do you call this stuff that's probably brandon my grave biscuits and gravy gravy gravy caribbean biscuits there you go orange juice and three cups of hot coffee black coffee negro no sugar tina sucker no cream crema i enjoyed my time have a phone call for from the brothers because we need to talk so i'm i i can't wait i want to talk to the brothers well the day after i i went i i moved from the hotel with the hotel a la casita well i spent some time in the casita and i was in the afternoon i i made my way to a hamburger restaurant and as a champion [Music] i started praying and then the lord started speaking to me he told me you have the right kind of expectation in his life because you are putting the expectation on the brothers but we are all humans and there is a limitation you know then and he told me because maybe some brothers some sisters that was a good lesson for me because the lord taught me because that's the only way is i so now aura we've been enjoying great time together young so as long as our expectation is based on human flesh we will be disappointed every day [Music] wow but he was not aware one very important thing he had a seed inside and that seed was because the seed is there in the sermon the patriarch abraham patriarch abraham from 1964. he says then one day alone came the royal seed of abraham jesus christ jesus christ the son of god abraham's seed that's meant to be abraham not through isaac not religious [Music] he you know he is the aiming corner yeah when when watching on youtube i i heard it amen amen so let's go to genesis 18 vamos a genesis dieseocho times go by you know where's one person and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent in the tenth door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tenth door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not the way i pray thee from vice servants that was something different it was not about you haven't given me any seeds you don't hear my prayers hey what was he looking at okay because porky wherever we sit we are looking at something wherever and this is very important it's very important because abraham he was up in the mountains he was also sitting in by keeping up with the life in the city because he was the major in the city he was a judge so he had to update himself all the time about things happening exactly that most people are doing it they are spending hours and hours and hours just looking at miranda it is endless it's infeeding of opportunities and the devil keeps people busy around the clock and even believers because there there's so many interesting things and we are receiving messages and we have to send messages faster and i don't think abraham had he was busy with that all the time but you may you may say that well i saw you brother martin you also had an ipad oh man that's right this is the tree of knowledge so i could throw away my ipad and sometimes that we can use them for the kids that i could sit in my kitchen in norway and receiving living water from a desert in mexico [Applause] if you told me that some few years ago i would rather call for those people with those white dresses you know i'm so blessed that i take my dog and bring him with me up in the forest and i lose my dog so he can run as what god has blessed me with that morning and i'm busy with that for maybe the next two hours and the first thing i tell the lord every morning when i go to the forest thank you lord gracias for your mercy and grace that you are taking care of me in such a wonderful way that i can sit in my little house and receive a recipe naming water agua de vida from that desert in new mexico because there are brothers and sisters there are okay abraham abraham when he received the promise he was 75 years old on the right kind of basis for a while he tried very hard himself to fulfill god's promise for a complete promise he produced something according to the flesh you see ben and even up to this day there are great consequences consequences abraham he had a good intention but he came to a certain point where he got kind of impatient it's producing jesus christ within you and me and it's more power in this message you see brother branham said this is by that power amen amen abraham had to grow abram took christ and the day he was 100 he was sitting there in the same tent [Applause] so three men were appearing amen amen in a fraction of a second in the twinkling of an eye he reacted to what he saw and he confessed my lord miss senor faith and building up our faith by the word of faith you see then every day if we put attention to other things [Music] so don't let that earthly kingdom disturb you don't feed yourself by this earthly kingdom feed yourself by the word of alimentary what is the rapture well we are expecting maybe the rapture being something that suddenly takes us i [Music] closer and we are so easily getting conformed to all those past happening and that was the old-fashioned kind of photography a via a via ora pelicula i can tell you something one day the lord you see man when i took that picture i had to remove the film you know when foreign is potential free es potential with all the fruits and a lot of other trees the tons of fruit but in order to have all those trees with all that fruit manifested the seed must be put into darkness in the earth you know what we see here it's actually the negative negative that there when you see a shadow it tells you that there is something real that's right okay so when i take that film i go into a dark room i put the film into some chemistry yes and that chemistry is a chemical must hold a certain level of temperature and you have to keep it there for a certain but now you have to put the film into a certain kind of camera or a tire capacitor camera and you put the white paper under it and you turn on the lights and you are projecting light through the negative negative and through the white paper [Music] but you must believe how many times brothers and sisters what does this mean when we don't see things we [Music] and then you must watch it and when you finish that process [Music] things what was he looking at a camera he was in the same process the lord had it actually took 25 years we are doing things faster and faster and faster and faster but there is one thing and the food is getting inside you la comida entrance it has to go through a process in order to to give you strength and power in order that no matter how fast this world goes that process takes exactly the same time when you eat your dinner that's when abraham had his dinner it doesn't go any faster this is god's time we must not skip the process we must not go digital not the vermouth it must we should be able to lift our yes and satan can see that there is a process which is jesus christ yes god bless you brother oh [Music] come on church give the lord a handclap of praise he deserves all the honor and glory don't stop right now that is your god thank you brother morton thank
