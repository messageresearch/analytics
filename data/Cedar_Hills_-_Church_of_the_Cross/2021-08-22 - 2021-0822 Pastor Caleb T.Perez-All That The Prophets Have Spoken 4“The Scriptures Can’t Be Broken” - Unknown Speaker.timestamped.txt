[55:15] have spoken fools and slow of heart to
[55:18] believe all that the prophets have
[55:21] spoken
[55:24] go ahead
[55:26] if he called them gods unto whom the
[55:28] word of god came and the scripture

[55:36] god add his blessings to the reading of
[55:37] his word you may be seated
[55:43] my my mother
[55:45] my mother had such a respect
[56:02] sometimes the bible might be on the side
[56:03] and we might be drinking something and
[56:05] we put it on the bible
[56:09] sometimes we'll get a book and we'll
[56:10] just throw it out there and sometimes it
[56:11] might land on top of the bible
[56:14] oh
[56:18] [Music]
[56:27] young people don't ever put anything on
[56:29] top of your bibles
[56:32] how many of you believe that the bible
[56:34] is infallible
[56:36] amen can i get an amen this morning
[56:40] we believe that the bible is infallible
[56:44] we believe we don't believe that there's
[56:46] any mistakes in the bible
[56:49] can i get a witness
[56:51] there are no contradictions in the bible
[56:55] there are no errors in the bible
[56:58] this is god in print form
[57:03] and that's why we look at the scripture
[57:06] we can simply say the scriptures cannot
[57:09] be broken
[57:29] [Music]
[57:33] i want you to hold your bible up those
[57:34] of you that brought your bible young
[57:36] people you brought your bibles
[57:38] all right making
[57:47] there is so much power that lays in
[57:49] these holy scriptures
[58:03] there is power in these holy scriptures
[58:07] [Applause]
[58:21] and we understand
[58:23] that what we're trying to accomplish
[58:25] here this morning
[58:29] and through the years
[58:30] we're trying to get the word into the
[58:32] heart
[58:34] if
[58:47] that's why i always tell you
[58:50] it is your duty to get the word inside
[58:52] of you
[58:55] read the book
[58:57] it's your duty
[58:58] to get the word inside of it
[59:02] brother branham quotes matthew 17 5.
[59:08] and the last few words
[59:10] this is my beloved son
[59:12] [Music]
[59:14] hear ye him
[59:16] the last three words is hear ye
[59:21] can you repeat that after me
[59:23] young people repeat that hear ye
[59:26] him one more time
[59:27] hear ye
[59:29] him amen brother branham says that those
[59:32] three words
[59:34] would be enough
[59:37] to send a revival all the way around the
[59:40] world
[59:43] and save every
[59:49] did you get that
[59:52] he he's not even saying the whole bible
[59:55] he said just those three words
[1:00:01] i want you to say it together hear ye
[1:00:04] him
[1:00:05] those three words once again
[1:00:08] is enough to send a revival all the way
[1:00:11] around the world
[1:00:19] if there is that much power in those
[1:00:22] three words
[1:00:24] then how about the whole scripture
[1:00:29] what would it do to your world
[1:00:34] that is why it is impossible for the
[1:00:36] scriptures to ever be broken
[1:00:53] listen closely now
[1:00:56] you can read it
[1:00:59] but continue though in the things which
[1:01:01] thou has learned
[1:01:03] and has been assured of
[1:01:05] knowing whom thou has learned them
[1:01:09] no i want to stop there knowing
[1:01:11] it says of whom
[1:01:14] thou has learned them
[1:01:17] because everybody's preaching from this
[1:01:19] bible right
[1:01:20] but knowing
[1:01:22] whom
[1:01:30] and thou from a child thou has known the
[1:01:32] holy scriptures the holy scriptures
[1:01:34] you've known them
[1:01:36] from a child
[1:01:40] which are able to make these wise unto
[1:01:42] salvation through christ through faith
[1:01:45] which is incorrect
[1:01:46] christ jesus through the holy scriptures
[1:01:50] they're able
[1:02:08] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[1:02:10] god and is profitable for doctrine of
[1:02:14] reproof for correction for instruction
[1:02:16] in righteousness
[1:02:18] verse 17.
[1:02:20] that the man of god may be perfect
[1:02:22] through
[1:02:24] in it and to the good work truly
[1:02:27] furnished unto all good works
[1:02:30] and if the prophets this is the message
[1:02:32] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:02:34] and forever
[1:02:36] and if the prophets he says
[1:02:39] jeremiah
[1:02:40] isaiah
[1:02:42] elisha
[1:02:43] if they had thus saith the lord
[1:02:58] as long as they have the word to
[1:03:55] did not the scripture say that they
[1:04:06] amen watch this now because he done the
[1:04:08] announcing
[1:04:10] he took the
[1:04:14] [Music]
[1:04:38] that the scriptures cannot be broken
[1:04:42] if jesus said the works that i do shall
[1:04:44] you do also
[1:04:48] that can't be broken
[1:04:51] uh i don't know i don't know if i'm
[1:04:53] talking to you to anybody today
[1:04:56] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:05:03] there is a people
[1:05:06] that will do the same works that he did
[1:05:10] as they know okay
[1:05:18] and the world sees
[1:05:34] if the bible said that jesus christ is
[1:05:37] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:05:41] that can't be broken either
[1:05:44] then he has to be the same
[1:05:48] principle
[1:06:01] and i tell you this morning
[1:06:17] and so is the son of god sending forth
[1:06:19] his spirit in these last days
[1:06:24] that his scriptures
[1:06:26] cannot be broken
[1:06:30] every
[1:06:49] that's the reason that we can place all
[1:06:51] our faith in the scriptures
[1:06:56] the catholic church believes
[1:07:10] that's just satan trying to
[1:07:12] break the scriptures
[1:07:15] and i'm here to tell you it's impossible
[1:07:17] it's impossible
[1:07:19] to tell your neighbor
[1:07:21] it's impossible
[1:07:23] to break the scriptures
[1:07:26] watch
[1:07:39] am i going to heaven boy
[1:07:43] i asked all of you this morning are you
[1:07:45] going to heaven
[1:07:48] brother branham says sure i am this is a
[1:07:51] minor adams he goes to void they say why
[1:07:54] because the scriptures can't be broken

[1:08:03] are you going to heaven gentlemen over
[1:08:05] here
[1:08:06] why are you going to heaven
[1:08:09] that's right because the scriptures
[1:08:12] can't be broken
[1:08:14] are you going to heaven
[1:08:16] why
[1:08:18] because you're good
[1:08:21] because we never make a mistake
[1:08:24] or because the scriptures can't be
[1:08:26] broken
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:31] it is written in the scriptures
[1:08:34] you're not little flock not amazed
[1:08:36] your
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:09:30] and in our text jesus he's coming from
[1:09:32] jerusalem
[1:10:06] come on church
[1:10:07] not even this morning can he do anything
[1:10:12] jesus of two thousand years ago
[1:10:29] now watch now the people thought he
[1:10:31] would he would be praying for all these
[1:10:33] thousands of sick people
[1:10:36] but he said until the father showed him
[1:10:38] first what to do
[1:10:42] john 5
[1:10:56] listen closely to this
[1:10:58] it wasn't given to him
[1:11:00] just to take the blessings of god
[1:11:05] and throw them out any which way he
[1:11:07] wished
[1:11:09] that's how many people serve the lord
[1:11:11] today
[1:11:13] even as ministers
[1:11:15] oh yeah just just throw out the
[1:11:16] blessings to whoever
[1:11:19] it wasn't given to him to do it that way
[1:11:34] and he said verily verily
[1:11:36] i say unto thee
[1:11:38] that
[1:11:52] god from his lips
[1:11:56] jesus said when he was here on earth
[1:12:00] can't be broken
[1:12:03] and that's why he said you destroyed
[1:12:05] this body
[1:12:18] the same reason that you and i should
[1:12:20] have that confidence
[1:12:33] neither will i suffer thy holy one to
[1:12:35] seek corruption
[1:12:37] that was the scripture
[1:12:42] gave him the confidence yes
[1:12:45] you put this down
[1:12:50] david said i will not suffer my holy one
[1:12:53] to seek corruption
[1:12:58] he knew the scripture pertained to him
[1:13:02] the scripture
[1:13:45] rarely do you find anyone that believes
[1:13:46] in god no more
[1:13:49] oh i don't believe the message no more
[1:13:52] everybody's doing their own thing
[1:13:54] it's just a free-for-all world
[1:14:27] as we look at this
[1:14:29] he knew that within 72 hours his body
[1:14:33] would be raised again
[1:14:37] i can see jesus getting whipped
[1:14:50] and that's why many people today how
[1:14:52] hard it is
[1:14:54] to
[1:15:15] was the same father that went with him
[1:15:22] [Applause]
[1:15:36] i can
[1:16:18] what a confident church
[1:16:20] we are the word bride this is someone
[1:16:23] we shall have the same confidence
[1:16:30] watch this now
[1:16:31] because the scriptures cannot be broken
[1:16:35] the word of god from the mouth of his
[1:16:37] holy prophets
[1:16:40] when he died
[1:16:46] the resurrecting power was already
[1:16:48] inside of him
[1:16:52] come here brother aaron
[1:16:57] all right brother david move this for a
[1:16:58] moment
[1:17:05] bring that chair
[1:17:13] here he comes into the tomb
[1:17:27] and
[1:17:28] he knows el salvade what all the
[1:17:31] scriptures were spoken about him
[1:17:36] he had in him when he went down
[1:17:39] the power of the resurrection power in
[1:17:41] him
[1:17:55] because i am the resurrection
[1:17:58] but there was something that
[1:18:00] kept him in the grave
[1:18:04] or he would have resurrected just like
[1:18:05] that
[1:18:07] what was it that was holding him
[1:18:19] but you know what kept him in the grave
[1:18:21] for that long time
[1:18:31] i don't know sometimes if we understand
[1:18:33] the power of the scripture
[1:18:36] the scripture
[1:18:38] is what kept him there
[1:18:42] but the scripture is also what releases
[1:18:47] that when before 72 hours would come
[1:18:51] the scripture then said
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:06] what
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:34] when there is a release
[1:19:37] that's why satan wants to do it
[1:19:40] what he's always trying to do
[1:19:43] is break scripture
[1:19:46] this whole thing is even if you could
[1:19:48] just break one little period
[1:19:53] i don't think you got it
[1:19:56] again
[1:19:57] he just has to remove one little iota
[1:19:59] yeah
[1:20:02] why
[1:20:16] he tries to break them by
[1:20:19] sowing seeds of doubt
[1:20:24] he tries to break them by saying that
[1:20:26] there are contradictions in there
[1:20:29] he tries to break them by saying oh they
[1:20:32] were just men
[1:20:35] and he goes on and on
[1:20:38] let me tell you this morning church
[1:20:41] that not even god can break the
[1:20:43] scriptures
[1:20:50] did you get i'm going to say it again
[1:20:51] not even god can break the scriptures
[1:20:56] because then it would be he would be
[1:20:58] breaking his
[1:21:26] john
[1:21:30] the jews answered saying for a good work
[1:21:31] we stoned thee not
[1:21:34] but for blasphemy
[1:21:36] and because of that thou being a man
[1:21:39] make this thyself god i'm gonna i'm just
[1:21:41] going to read it in english
[1:21:42] just to save time
[1:21:43] jesus answered them is it not written in
[1:21:46] your law i said he are gods
[1:21:52] jesus is telling them i'm the one that
[1:21:54] said it
[1:21:57] i don't know if you cut that or not
[1:21:59] i'm going to read it again
[1:22:01] jesus and answered them
[1:22:03] is it not written in your law
[1:22:07] i said
[1:22:15] what a scripture when you stop for a
[1:22:17] moment
[1:22:18] and here he is jesus standing there
[1:22:22] a man
[1:22:50] are you getting it are you getting the
[1:22:52] bride's doctrine
[1:22:55] that's where we ended last time if you
[1:22:57] remember
[1:22:59] we received a scriptural word prophet
[1:23:03] therefore we are to be a scriptural word
[1:23:07] church
[1:23:13] knows that he cannot deceive this price
[1:23:31] and the scriptures
[1:23:33] and not be broken
[1:23:37] when the scripture says
[1:23:41] the scripture is never broken
[1:23:43] i want you to understand that the
[1:23:45] scripture is never broken
[1:24:01] in your life he will try to break the
[1:24:03] continuity of it
[1:24:07] keep it from getting to you
[1:24:12] when it says honor your father and
[1:24:13] mother
[1:24:28] the scripture says honor your father and
[1:24:30] mother
[1:24:32] and you don't
[1:24:33] you know the continuity of the
[1:24:35] scriptures
[1:24:37] is broken
[1:24:41] that's why nothing goes right for me
[1:25:10] because everybody wants to be
[1:25:12] the one
[1:25:14] look at those kids
[1:25:18] the mystery of the seven stars
[1:25:20] [Applause]
[1:25:23] but we get into those things because
[1:25:26] this continuity of the scripture has
[1:25:28] been broken
[1:25:32] we talk about the perfecting of the
[1:25:33] saints without a fightful ministry
[1:25:38] you've broken
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:26:06] you see once again the scriptures cannot
[1:26:08] be broken
[1:26:11] but the continuity of the scripture in
[1:26:13] your life is what is broken
[1:26:19] in the message straight is the gate
[1:27:03] and he would attach
[1:27:05] knowing the scriptures
[1:27:09] and he would put it together with the
[1:27:11] power of god
[1:27:14] you do air not knowing the scriptures he
[1:27:16] says
[1:28:12] they know them in their own book of
[1:28:14] learning
[1:28:16] in their catechisms
[1:28:19] they noted in their theology
[1:28:21] but jesus said
[1:28:23] you don't know
[1:28:26] you don't know the scriptures
[1:28:29] then neither do you know the power
[1:28:33] how incredible it is as he puts that
[1:28:35] together
[1:28:37] this morning brother and sister
[1:28:40] let us not fall
[1:28:52] what is the bride's doctrine is
[1:29:08] but
[1:29:21] the continuity of the word
[1:29:34] the unchanging
[1:29:36] continuity of god's word
[1:29:41] and his words
[1:29:45] he never changes
[1:29:48] he never changes his ways no canvas
[1:29:55] the scripture is in perfect continuity
[1:30:00] everything that god does is in
[1:30:02] continuity with what he done
[1:30:31] is the first time that he uses that
[1:30:33] phrase word right
[1:30:36] the mysterious writer
[1:30:40] watch what he does
[1:30:42] listen closely that's going to help you
[1:30:46] oppose refuse to repent
[1:30:50] and go back to the original blood word
[1:30:54] the word became
[1:30:56] blood and flesh
[1:31:56] this is where you're supposed to fit in
[1:32:00] how many how many i mean everybody's
[1:32:02] done done puzzles right
[1:32:10] you know when you get a piece that just
[1:32:12] doesn't go there and you're trying to
[1:32:13] force it in and it doesn't go
[1:32:16] always trying to force ourselves into
[1:32:18] that puzzle
[1:32:22] why are we always trying to force
[1:32:23] ourselves into the things of the world
[1:32:26] we were made to fit in there
[1:32:28] you're trying to break the continuity of
[1:32:31] the scriptures
[1:32:37] where do you fit
[1:32:39] yeah
[1:32:40] in the mystical body of the lord jesus
[1:32:43] we are members of that body
[1:32:46] members in particular remembers in
[1:32:48] particular
[1:32:52] oh watch what he says here
[1:32:54] you see he's against her
[1:32:57] he forms his own bride
[1:33:00] called the antichrist
[1:33:02] by an antichrist teaching
[1:33:05] contrary to christ
[1:33:07] oh see how shrewd he is
[1:33:10] the antichrist refuses the true bright
[1:33:12] doctrine
[1:33:20] of
[1:33:48] she becomes
[1:34:02] will
[1:34:10] it's happening tomorrow
[1:34:14] it's happening
[1:34:15] right now
[1:34:22] [Applause]
[1:34:52] [Applause]
[1:35:11] now when the word comes forth listen
[1:35:14] closely because it starts out as a
[1:35:17] mental thing
[1:35:20] a mental conception
[1:35:23] in the mind
[1:35:24] and then the enthusiasts must drop to
[1:35:27] your heart
[1:35:29] and become a divine faith
[1:35:32] a divine revelation
[1:35:35] but i'm going to shock you with this
[1:35:38] forever learning
[1:35:40] but
[1:36:07] that is the mark of the beast
[1:36:11] the same word though
[1:36:13] because you're rejecting it
[1:36:15] maybe not by your mind
[1:36:17] but you rejected it with your heart
[1:36:21] says the soul that sin is
[1:36:35] it becomes a divine faith
[1:37:03] and i keep on going just for a little
[1:37:04] bit more okay
[1:37:07] you haven't heard me in a little while
[1:37:08] so
[1:37:09] it's ongoing
[1:37:14] what happened
[1:37:16] the word came into your mind
[1:37:46] i know the bible
[1:38:00] hostel
[1:38:14] thessalonians 2 13.
[1:38:16] let's read it from up there
[1:38:19] for this cause also thank you god
[1:38:21] without ceasing because when he received
[1:38:23] the word of god because when you
[1:38:25] received the word of god
[1:38:27] which he heard of us which he heard from
[1:38:30] who us
[1:38:31] oh this is paul talking
[1:38:33] he received it as as not as he received
[1:38:37] it not
[1:38:38] not as the world of men but as oh hold
[1:38:40] on hold on
[1:38:42] there's a lot here you can read it
[1:38:45] because when you receive the word of god
[1:38:47] which you heard of us
[1:38:49] what you received it not as
[1:38:51] word of man
[1:38:55] speaking it's not a massive
[1:39:01] the word of god which effectually
[1:39:04] worketh also in you that believe oh the
[1:39:07] word of god that work is effectual it's
[1:39:09] got enough depth in it
[1:39:23] the tree of life that comes from god out
[1:39:25] of heaven
[1:39:27] and if a man eats this he never dies
[1:39:31] then when he went away
[1:39:33] he purchased
[1:39:34] a bride tree
[1:39:37] yeah
[1:39:43] and that tree was established
[1:39:47] and putting in the roots of the earth
[1:39:50] the day of pentecost
[1:40:06] was give
[1:40:15] for nearly 2 000 years wait wait till we
[1:40:18] get to this part
[1:40:20] for
[1:40:48] he got a piece off of himself
[1:40:52] oh it's just the new testament
[1:40:56] we have the old and the new yeah
[1:41:00] he fulfilled the old testament
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:16] yes
[1:41:30] but
[1:41:39] no i don't know if there's anybody in it
[1:41:41] part of the bride here
[1:41:43] maybe there's a lot of church
[1:41:45] this morning
[1:41:46] but now i'm talking to the bride
[1:41:50] that you're part of the bride
[1:41:56] we'll fulfill
[1:41:57] everything
[1:42:25] he does it by his
[1:43:43] what a challenge to us
[1:43:48] the works that i do shall you do also la
[1:43:50] soros
[1:44:26] christianity has been represented to you
[1:44:31] in the form of doctrine in the form of
[1:44:33] doctrine and pamphlets
[1:44:35] and in bible
[1:44:37] and i am foreign
[1:44:43] god help those missionaries that go
[1:44:45] there to live there questions
[1:45:27] [Applause]
[1:45:42] this
[1:45:44] god it's in word only
[1:45:48] but the god that wrote that word
[1:45:51] that you've already got placed in your
[1:45:52] heart
[1:45:54] has now come to a place
[1:46:21] when they saw a living god
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:48] but we want to keep on going a little
[1:46:49] bit more
[1:46:51] we don't have service this afternoon
[1:46:54] let's go for a little while longer
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:57] amen
[1:46:59] the continuity of the scriptures must
[1:47:01] not be broken
[1:47:04] i'm going to skip some of this stuff
[1:47:05] because i want to i want to get to
[1:47:07] something here
[1:47:10] with all the prophecies that were
[1:47:12] written about jesus christ
[1:47:20] with all the prophecies that were
[1:47:22] written about jesus christ
[1:47:27] how would it be possible young people
[1:47:29] listen closely
[1:47:31] i want your your attention
[1:47:34] how would it be possible possibly for
[1:47:37] the scriptures to be so accurate
[1:47:44] you're going to meet up with people out
[1:47:45] there in the world
[1:47:48] in school
[1:48:00] many of them being written
[1:48:02] 1500
[1:49:53] now the difference between him and you
[1:49:55] as a son and like
[1:49:58] he was at the beginning the word
[1:50:02] body
[1:50:03] he came in and lived in that film
[1:50:06] in the person of melchizedek
[1:50:22] now you bypass that
[1:50:27] because in that form
[1:50:30] he knows all things
[1:50:32] and you have never been able to know
[1:50:34] that
[1:50:43] i'm going to say it again you have not
[1:50:45] been able to know that
[1:50:47] yet
[1:50:50] but when the message come forward
[1:50:53] what did it do
[1:50:54] it began to activate it
[1:50:56] it began to release
[1:50:59] the members of the body
[1:51:02] who they were
[1:51:04] knowing
[1:51:15] it was such a beautiful message on
[1:51:16] wednesday how many enjoyed that
[1:51:32] you have
[1:51:45] the father that sent him went with him
[1:51:49] then if he knew all things yesterday
[1:51:51] god knows all things
[1:51:53] even the way that he died even
[1:51:56] in the circumstances of his death
[1:51:59] had to be divinely ordained
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:35] [Applause]
[1:52:41] it controls the body
[1:52:57] what sent the right man at the right
[1:52:59] time to help him carry the cross
[1:53:04] and what about controlling
[1:53:08] the precise moment
[1:53:15] [Applause]
[1:53:35] [Applause]
[1:54:07] broken
[1:54:09] during the crucifixion of jesus
[1:54:11] christ
[1:54:12] the normal procedure that requires
[1:54:14] breaking the lower legs
[1:54:17] the the procedure
[1:54:32] this is not some hollywood fiction story
[1:55:14] the thought of god
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:30] that there was a virgin
[1:55:33] that believed
[1:55:35] a virgin that was waiting
[1:55:38] and by the transmission
[1:55:41] the message came from an angel
[1:56:06] [Applause]
[1:56:10] she accepts the word of the angel
[1:56:26] sometimes because this is this blows me
[1:56:28] away
[1:56:32] why can't we pick up anything from the
[1:56:33] fourth dimension
[1:56:36] on our own
[1:56:38] we need a television
[1:56:40] we need apparatus
[1:56:57] when you think about dimensions
[1:56:59] i mean even brother brown's talking
[1:57:00] about the angel said they came at such a
