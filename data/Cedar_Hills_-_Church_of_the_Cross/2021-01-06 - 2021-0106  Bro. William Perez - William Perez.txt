going to go into exodus chapter 20. and we're going to start with uh verse 6 and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain your gracious and heavenly father all around the world lord there is a place that we can come to you lord to be

this this year's this year is a milestone for me [Music] i'm going to be um in in march i'm going to be 40 years old and marco yeah the lord for that gracias you know and and as i was as i was pondering my life here you know you you there's certain scriptures that you have read hundreds and hundreds of times and sometimes when you read them again they you know you just keep on you just keep on going through them and maybe at that time they don't mean much to you maybe at that time there are certain things that are not revealed to you yet that for a brief moment they look for a for a temporary fix for something that's that's going to fill what they what they long for that will take away the feeling of emptiness and it took me to the fourth commandment thou shall not take the name of the lord thy god in vain and many times when we read this scripture while we first think about well it's it's it's saying um it's saying a cuss word it's cursing god saying bad words what [Music] bless me bendy bless me help me bless me and we realized that through it all we're taking or i'm taking it and he's looking at us you're praying for the exact same thing over and over you're praying for healing i've already done it you're praying for salvation my goodness moses spent 40 years thinking he was somebody and 40 years discovering what god can do with the nobody brings me to the book of romans de los romanos you know this year or 2020 i should say the official mascot of 2020. so official mascot of 2020 was a raccoon well they say that the raccoon is always washing his hands you see him he's always wearing a mask right correcto and if you if you jumble the words around or the letters around of raccoons you can spell corona corona in english so it's the official mascot of 2020. but there's there's there's something that i that i discovered about this little animal and we'll get to that in the book of romans chapter 6 verse 23. my wife is always asking me what are you going to preach on animal wise you know before i read the rest of this you know sometimes i can't even get through a entire entire verse without just just thinking about other stuff so i couldn't get past wages it says for the wages now brother aaron like many of you have a job correct or have had a job maybe you're retired now yourself to just happens you know but at the end of the week you

what you're expecting to receive for the wages of sin is muerte there's no other thing beyond that there's it doesn't say for the wages of sin you're gonna get a slap on the wrist no because there is

to receive an ipad is and that's the way that we are sometimes is that we expect esperamos when we're in sin when we're sinning when we that oh the bible says this but it's not really true you receive the gift of god you know what you know what saying i am quitting before my payday becomes for the wages of sin there's a story of a former zookeeper yes why would you why would you get a wild animal like this oh they're adorable they're so cute he says raccoons go through a glandular go through a change at about 24 months after that they often attack their owners a 30-pound raccoon can be equal

the lord salvation is free this is salvation the gift i have he says let's go into the book of first peter 118. everybody's still with me this evening first peter 1 18 for as much as you know that ye were not redeemed with corruptable things my goodness conversation received by tradition from your father good news good news but somebody says oh there's bad news with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without sounds great is the plan that's what i'm going to follow that is good stuff as soon as we leave the doors and that free stuff colossians the word god is so rich with 13 excuse me and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses [Music] to receive that gift of god is the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way oh my goodness somebody's got to give give a hand and we're gonna go i've preached on this it's been a couple of years but imagine you as a slave as somebody that had no rights that had that just was there working for somebody imagine one day you up and left you you left they said and not only did you leave you know you took something that was valuable to your masters you were on the run established there is no way ninguna manera that you can pay off the debt that you have cause number one you're a slave a slave was worth about five say five hundred dollars [Music] or five hundred denarii i should say this is about a year and a half of of a normal person's hey let's go into the book of palimin what and here is onesimus who had just left his master but somehow let's go into verse 10 110. i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my bonds and i'll just read this in english [Music] which in time was to the unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me whom i have sent again thou therefore receive him receive him that is mine own that is my that is my known vows whom i would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel but without thy mind would i do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou should has received him forever not now as a servant but above a certain but above a servant a brother beloved especially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the lord if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myself if he hath wronged thee or all with the ought but he's no more a slave he spent a little bit of time with paul and paul is saying he was a servant when he left but even even though he was one of us even though he's a brother now okay you still have to go back and you have to fix the situation regular situation that has that still has to be fixed the debt still has to be paid what paul is saying whatever he do you remember what he did on the cross he showed us grace he died for you he died for me for me the debt that i had to get could never never my amen if he has wronged the oral with the uh put that on my account you know many times paul pablo he would this is what this is what god did for us for each and every one of us he says i paul because have written it with my own hand demi manohar how am i supposed to know how brother david feels unless i come down here he started writing with his own hand he says i will repent he said i don't know how no it says albeit i do not say to thee how thou always unto me he's going to do but right now oh he's doing something miraculous he's doing something great can we see can we capture what he's doing a gift is only a gift if i receive it as a gift it doesn't do me any good if brother julian gave me this
