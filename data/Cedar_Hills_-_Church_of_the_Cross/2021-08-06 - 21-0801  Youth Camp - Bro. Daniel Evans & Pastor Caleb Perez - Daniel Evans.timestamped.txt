[0:00] so this morning we have a chance
[0:04] kill that boy that's in there
[0:07] and now you're gonna fill that void
[0:10] that's there
[0:12] all right friends i i i've been just
[0:17] relaxed for those that weren't here last
[0:19] night
[0:20] we uh we gave some testimonies and uh we
[0:23] were talking about
[0:25] we're talking about brother branham and
[0:26] the different things that that
[0:28] that the lord did through him and and i
[0:30] was able to share
[0:31] some testimonies that came to my family
[0:35] and with my family way back when they
[0:37] were close with both rand and his family
[0:39] and
[0:40] when we talked about those things and i
[0:42] was i woke up this morning
[0:44] and these minister brothers will
[0:47] know what i mean when i say this that
[0:50] that very long day okay
[0:55] all right it was what i said was that
[0:59] is that easy to do and uh i want to read
[1:02] a scripture
[1:03] really fast in saint john chapter 21.
[1:08] and this this scripture came in my heart
[1:10] this morning
[1:29] i remember john as a disciple
[1:33] john was with jesus
[1:36] and john through his
[1:39] his testimony he gave testimonies of the
[1:42] things that happened
[1:44] and he said this
[1:48] he said this disciple which testifies at
[1:51] these things
[1:52] and wrote these things and we know that
[1:56] his testimony is true
[1:59] and this is the part that i love so much
[2:02] brother because
[2:03] this is the ministry that i was talking
[2:05] about last night
[2:09] and there are also many other things
[2:11] which jesus did the which if they should
[2:13] be written everyone i suppose
[2:15] that even the world itself could not
[2:17] contain the books that
[2:18] would be written amen that's what we
[2:22] [Applause]
[2:34] witnessed
[2:36] one here
[2:40] none of you were there when these things
[2:43] happen
[2:44] i talked about last night
[2:49] and like uh and for those that weren't
[2:52] here i talked about last night i talked
[2:54] about
[2:55] joshua going over jordan and when he
[2:58] went over
[2:59] he had these men and they picked up
[3:01] these stones
[3:02] and they stacked these stones up
[3:05] and joshua commanded he said you bring
[3:08] your children
[3:09] back to these stones can you see see
[3:12] these stones right here
[3:14] let me tell you the story behind these
[3:16] stones
[3:18] and i wanted this camp camp thunderbird
[3:22] i wanted these young people the lord and
[3:24] terry that you could be
[3:25] your children back to this place yes yes
[3:28] and you can see this place right here
[3:31] this is where i received the holy spirit
[3:35] this is where i dedicated my life to the
[3:37] lord this is where
[3:38] your mother or your dad this is
[3:42] those choices yeah and friends you're
[3:45] going to have an opportunity
[3:46] today i'm going to give a testimony at
[3:48] the end
[3:49] of the service and i said
[3:52] last night it's the greatest experience
[3:54] that i've ever had
[3:56] in my lifetime and i'm going to talk
[4:00] about
[4:01] someone that made a choice same choice
[4:04] that every single one of you has today
[4:09] everyone and i want to talk about
[4:12] this choice that this brother had and
[4:14] whether he made the right choice
[4:17] he made the wrong choice but
[4:20] as i was as i said that last night some
[4:22] of the sisters came to me
[4:24] afterwards and on fire and they said he
[4:27] said hey uh
[4:28] you know you said that you saw the dead
[4:30] race
[4:31] remember when i said that i was like
[4:34] yeah they said
[4:36] you want to hear this story i'll tell
[4:38] you what i'll tell that testimony before
[4:41] we get started
[4:42] um in the morning of service so here we
[4:44] are and uh
[4:46] i want to tell that story some of you
[4:48] have probably heard of heard about it
[4:51] i was in service and
[4:55] at the at the tabernacle we have we have
[4:58] um
[4:59] when i was when i was going to the
[5:01] tabernacle we were meeting in in a big
[5:04] auditory because there's too many people
[5:06] to fit in
[5:07] the church itself people get there
[5:10] really early for church
[5:13] because you wanted to you want to get in
[5:14] the he'd always be the firstborn
[5:16] there
[5:18] well he came to church he was the first
[5:20] one there
[5:23] so so he gets in there he sits way over
[5:25] in the corner like maybe where his
[5:26] brother is over here
[5:27] maybe maybe back there somewhere nobody
[5:29] saw him but he was over there by himself
[5:32] and before service started
[5:36] he made a strange sound it sounded like
[5:38] a storm
[5:41] and the brother behind him noticed it
[5:45] and what had happened when he made that
[5:47] sentence his heart
[5:50] stopped
[5:55] he passed away there and
[5:59] he wasn't noticed for a while
[6:03] but what had happened is when you die
[6:05] all of you lose all of your muscle
[6:07] um your ability and and it's now doping
[6:10] and all the jewel came down on his chest
[6:12] of course your your kidneys move your
[6:16] bowels move
[6:17] you die there's there's nothing no wife
[6:19] in here
[6:22] the uh the sister as a nurse she was
[6:25] sitting a couple of
[6:26] people down from him she noticed me
[6:30] and my brother in the flesh he's a
[6:32] paramedic
[6:33] and he's in charge of anytime there's
[6:35] any type of
[6:37] medical issue at the tabernacle at
[6:39] stillwater's youth camp or a course of
[6:40] god recordings
[6:42] he's in charge because of his experience
[6:45] in handling these emergency situations
[6:47] he went over there and and
[6:51] the brother was hunched down in his
[6:52] chair and he was
[6:54] little leaning over and i was i was
[6:56] about from here to uh the brother in the
[6:58] in there
[6:59] and i was looking down down the road
[7:02] there
[7:04] and my brother came and we have a trauma
[7:08] surgeon
[7:08] in a church his name is matt gold and
[7:11] brother matt
[7:11] also he's whenever he sees my brother
[7:13] get up for the mat
[7:15] he'll get up too because of jen's
[7:17] ability his doctor
[7:18] he followed my brother my brother
[7:22] noticed he was dead and to tell
[7:25] myself there was a presence there
[7:29] it wasn't like an emotional presence but
[7:32] i looked down and i saw he was obviously
[7:34] dead and i got
[7:35] excited and i told my wife i said
[7:38] he's dead and my wife later on she says
[7:42] don't embarrassed me you were so wild
[7:44] and you said that
[7:45] but but but he was and i knew it but i
[7:48] knew what was gonna happen
[7:50] there was something in him that i knew
[7:52] so
[7:53] so my brother gets down and he kneels
[7:55] down and puts his hand
[7:56] on his on his chest he opens up his
[7:59] shirt he puts his hand on his chest
[8:01] and the lord spoke to my brother
[8:04] and he said make sure
[8:07] he's dead because you will be giving
[8:09] this testimony later on
[8:12] wow my brother had his hands on chest
[8:16] the trauma surgeon brother matt was
[8:18] standing behind
[8:20] like this and and he had
[8:24] his hand trying to get a pulse no false
[8:28] there's another brother and he was
[8:30] trying to get a pulse behind his way
[8:34] brother joseph random was at the pulpit
[8:37] brother joseph
[8:39] came down we were taking the offering
[8:42] wow when this happened
[8:44] and then the plate was going by we were
[8:46] singing
[8:47] it was presents and like i said it
[8:50] wasn't emotional
[8:51] we just knew joseph came
[8:54] comes down he kneels down my brother's
[8:56] hands we're on about james's chest
[8:59] man slice his hand underneath my
[9:01] brothers
[9:06] and i'm praying that i look up
[9:11] and look to my left just in time
[9:14] to see facebook pray
[9:20] for
[9:23] saw his mouth closed his eyes were open
[9:28] before his eyes closed and blinked
[9:31] but the mat was standing behind and
[9:35] and his pulse
[9:41] my brother had his his hands on his
[9:43] chest
[9:44] and his chest raised up wow he took a
[9:47] breath
[9:47] my brother looked up at her back and he
[9:49] says i have i have a i have respiration
[9:52] but a man says i've got a pulse he
[9:55] trained
[9:56] trained medical people no cpr no
[9:59] nothing so his heart started being the
[10:02] brother
[10:02] the brother came back too so that they
[10:05] took him to the hospital
[10:07] after that took him outside they took
[10:10] him to the hospital
[10:12] and brother matt the surgeon
[10:15] went with brother james
[10:18] and the doctors checked them out up and
[10:21] down
[10:21] everything they didn't even find any
[10:23] damage to his heart
[10:25] but they found one thing it was very odd
[10:29] his temperature is four degrees below
[10:32] normal
[10:33] it's a lot his temperature was four
[10:35] degrees below
[10:36] normal but that started doing math
[10:39] as a doctor when you die
[10:43] you have some room temperature and your
[10:45] temperature starts to go down
[10:48] wow wow those four degrees were
[10:50] consistent with an hour and a half
[10:52] wow that he was dead which is consistent
[10:55] with
[10:55] all the testimonies of the grudge so
[10:58] so yes my sister i saw
[11:02] a dead man
[11:14] with that experience that i had at
[11:17] stillwater's youth camp that i'll
[11:18] talk about in a little while and it's
[11:24] it's for you and talking with you all
[11:27] today
[11:28] there's we're all in tough situations
[11:35] when you're making decisions right now
[11:39] you're making decisions that are going
[11:41] to affect you for the rest of your life
[11:43] more than any time in your life the
[11:46] decisions
[11:47] that you all are making now are going to
[11:51] affect you
[11:52] for years and years
[11:56] and there's there's two forces working
[11:58] on you right now
[11:59] okay i'm me too standing in the pocket
[12:03] they're working on you right now but it
[12:06] was the force
[12:08] that is trying to get you
[12:11] to have communion and fellowship
[12:14] with the lord jesus there's that verse
[12:18] that's god himself he wants that
[12:21] fellowship with him
[12:22] that's why we're here that's why we have
[12:24] a youth camp that's why we have our
[12:26] pastor here
[12:27] all right brother caleb well caleb's job
[12:30] as a pastor
[12:31] is not to bring you to him it's not to
[12:34] bring you to church
[12:36] it's not even it's not even it's not to
[12:37] bring you to brother branham's message
[12:39] it's not even to bring you to this bible
[12:42] because you can read this bible and not
[12:44] understand it
[12:46] our job is to bring
[12:50] you to the lord jesus
[12:53] and to get you to have that fellowship
[12:55] with him
[12:56] that relationship with him and if you
[12:59] have that relationship with him you'll
[13:01] be fine
[13:02] you'll sin you'll mess up you'll do
[13:04] things wrong yeah you will we all do
[13:06] all of us do but once you have that
[13:09] relationship with the lord jesus
[13:13] that's what your parents want that's why
[13:16] they tell you don't do this don't do
[13:18] that don't do this
[13:19] you know it's like oh i'm not allowed to
[13:21] do anything can we not do
[13:23] anything don't worry they want you to
[13:26] have
[13:27] that relationship and friends win
[13:30] with me i do anything i want
[13:35] when you experience that change you
[13:38] don't
[13:38] want to sin anymore you still do
[13:42] you still mess up but there's a point
[13:45] to come that you don't you want
[13:50] you want to do things that are pleasing
[13:53] to the lord
[13:53] i love to there's things that i love to
[13:57] do
[13:58] you know i love to go hunting i love to
[14:00] go fishing i love to
[14:01] i love to work on my car
[14:04] i don't like to work on my car that much
[14:06] but
[14:09] i like to clean my car i like to wash my
[14:10] car let me put it down i like to do that
[14:13] those are things that
[14:15] are those things pleasing to the lord
[14:16] yet they're good
[14:19] but the lord knows he he's my son he
[14:22] likes to do these things
[14:24] you know and i do and i like to do those
[14:25] things and there'll be things that you
[14:27] all like to do
[14:28] but then there's another delicious boy
[14:33] and instead of like tommy and
[14:36] caleb that are trying to get you to
[14:38] christ
[14:39] there's another force
[14:44] and this force is trying to break that
[14:47] relationship
[14:49] that force is trying to step in
[14:54] the middle of that relationship
[14:58] two forces and you can always identify
[15:01] them
[15:02] pretty soon we're going to read a
[15:03] scripture
[15:05] but we can always identify those two
[15:07] forces
[15:08] is this force over here is this getting
[15:11] me
[15:12] closer to god or is it
[15:15] pulling me away i'm not allowed
[15:18] and we talk about our friends
[15:22] and we talk about we talk about these
[15:25] things that you young people go on these
[15:27] forces they're so
[15:28] strong on you you boys
[15:32] the first force that attacks you
[15:35] is girls is these
[15:38] worldly girls going to school
[15:42] you know and they're so nice you know
[15:44] and and the boys attacked the girls too
[15:47] but man this is a pull on the young men
[15:52] and they try and and here it is
[15:56] presented in a way
[15:59] you know and then you girls there's this
[16:02] force that's
[16:03] pulling on you it's like
[16:06] don't you don't look like that try to
[16:08] look like everybody else
[16:10] and then you get into my mind why do i
[16:11] have to look different why do i have to
[16:13] be
[16:13] different well what what is it
[16:17] and then there's a pull on you
[16:20] to look like look like these other kids
[16:22] that you know
[16:24] let's go to school with whatever and
[16:26] there's there's these different forces
[16:29] that pull on us and
[16:33] in brother brown's message that we
[16:35] studied
[16:36] in preparation for this camp is your
[16:39] life worthy of the gospel
[16:40] how many times and there's a few that
[16:43] had uh
[16:44] on the pages i love that there's a few
[16:46] that had that that
[16:47] read the quote that brother graham says
[16:49] you have to have that personal
[16:50] relationship with jesus
[16:52] and he talks about that throughout that
[16:54] message
[16:56] and that's everything it's it's
[16:59] everything to us it's the most
[17:03] important thing in the world
[17:08] the enemy wants to break down
[17:13] i was a very
[17:17] other families very close
[17:20] people i think the world they uh
[17:25] married a couple of kids
[17:28] they ended up getting on the websites
[17:32] known that they're critical of us
[17:36] of what we believe and there's things on
[17:39] there that they're
[17:40] reading and they end up saying listen
[17:43] brother brown's a false problems wow
[17:46] wrong we don't believe them anymore
[17:50] and and we're out of this
[17:53] so they moved to california southern

[20:25] questions answering questions
[20:28] about program's message answering
[20:30] questions about
[20:31] the bible people would call in and then
[20:33] they'd get a track and they'd call and
[20:34] they'd say now who is this william
[20:36] branham
[20:36] answering those type of questions even
[20:38] if i i've had questions
[20:40] about this one sister called she was so
[20:42] upset because she accidentally washed
[20:44] her husband's prayer cloth
[20:46] and she didn't know what to do and she
[20:48] said is that a problem with it
[20:50] you know i accidentally watched it it
[20:52] was painless
[20:55] no problem it's all these questions one
[20:57] of the questions that would come in was
[21:00] his brother ran on a false problem
[21:03] because of this evidence this evidence
[21:06] accepted
[21:07] himself and i told him i said
[21:12] no ask me any of these questions that
[21:16] you have
[21:18] so they had a conversation and this
[21:22] conversation
[21:23] most of the questions i could answer
[21:25] some i could
[21:26] and i said i don't know and
[21:30] at the end of the conversation it was so
[21:32] nice it was such a good conversation
[21:34] in the conversation they said to me
[21:37] they said we went to the pastor of the
[21:40] church
[21:42] and we asked him these questions and he
[21:45] said just believe it
[21:46] don't question it just believe it just
[21:48] just just don't even look at it don't
[21:49] even look at that stuff just believe it
[21:51] that didn't work
[21:53] they asked their parents parents said
[21:56] the same thing just believe it just
[21:58] don't question it just
[21:59] just don't just stay away from that
[22:00] stuff
[22:02] and they told me they said they were
[22:03] afraid
[22:05] about these things about brother branham
[22:07] they were afraid
[22:08] of them and they said
[22:13] but daniel you're not afraid
[22:17] how come you're not afraid i'm the only
[22:20] one we know that's not afraid
[22:22] about these things that we're saying
[22:25] i'm not and i told him i said these
[22:29] words
[22:29] i don't even care about these things
[22:33] so then they left and i i went to my
[22:36] room and
[22:37] and and started praying
[22:42] is there something wrong
[22:46] because all these things that they were
[22:50] saying some things i can't explain but i
[22:51] don't care
[22:53] i really doesn't bother me these things
[22:56] that they're saying about brother brown
[22:59] doesn't affect me
[23:03] straight i'm not the bad prank
[23:07] about it then i woke up
[23:10] and i was still praying and then the
[23:14] lord spoke
[23:16] and he said he said this
[23:21] he said william brandt
[23:25] a message is a success
[23:29] in your life my life
[23:32] because he introduced
[23:35] you to me
[23:51] these ministers these deacons these
[23:53] trustees
[23:54] we have these brothers and moms you know
[23:57] these these blessed people that pray for
[24:00] you that's their ultimate goal
[24:02] that's the success of brother brown's
[24:05] nest
[24:06] is that you would know jesus
[24:14] and that you would have that fellowship
[24:20] now we get to my favorite part of the
[24:21] service let's turn
[24:23] to genesis chapter
[24:26] chapter 3.
[24:32] this is my favorite part of the service
[24:34] friends because i could say something
[24:36] wrong
[24:40] but if we read this bible
[24:45] bible friends it's so important
[24:51] god wrote this bible yes when you
[24:54] open this bible when you look into these
[24:58] words
[24:59] you're looking into the very face of god
[25:02] yes
[25:03] this is what he has preserved for us
[25:06] remember my little analogy yesterday of
[25:09] google maps and you take the little guy
[25:10] and
[25:11] drop him in we're going to drop
[25:13] ourselves right here
[25:15] into this bible don't neglect it one of
[25:18] the brothers said
[25:19] let's go to kayla when we were out by
[25:21] the
[25:23] bonfire out there when he was doing the
[25:25] pages
[25:26] but caleb said he said he was okay we
[25:29] said
[25:29] don't just read over these things
[25:33] don't just read over these pages just to
[25:36] get through them
[25:37] friends when you read this bible make
[25:40] sure you know what's going on
[25:42] when you read a scripture verse don't
[25:44] just read it to get get through it
[25:46] stop on that verse if you don't
[25:48] understand it
[25:49] pray about it study it get to understand
[25:52] this
[25:54] by the grace of god we understand what
[25:57] genesis
[25:58] chapter 3 is
[26:01] amen very very important
[26:05] if you've heard you've heard of the
[26:06] serpent seed
[26:08] circumcising doctrine yeah yeah i mean
[26:10] we know what it is we've we've had this
[26:12] revelation in the end
[26:13] but friends there's a deeper meaning
[26:15] behind the serpent-seat doctrine
[26:17] that we should never forget it's not
[26:20] just the relationship
[26:23] it's that satan came in
[26:26] to break that relationship between
[26:30] adam and eve and the lord
[26:33] start with verse one
[26:36] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[26:38] beast of the field
[26:39] which the lord god had made and he said
[26:42] to the woman yea have god said
[26:44] ye shall not eat of every tree of the
[26:46] garden
[26:48] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[26:51] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[26:53] garden
[26:54] but the fruit of the tree which is in
[26:56] the midst of the garden
[26:58] god hath said ye shall not eat of it
[27:00] neither shall ye touch it lest he die
[27:03] and the serpent said unto the woman
[27:06] you shall not assure god
[27:14] for god doesn't know that in the day
[27:18] that you meet there
[27:19] then your eyes shall be opened you shall
[27:22] be as gods
[27:23] knowing good and evil and then when the
[27:25] woman saw that the tree was good for
[27:27] food
[27:27] and was buzzing to the eyes and treated
[27:29] me desire to make one wise
[27:31] she took up the fruit thereof indeed and
[27:34] gave
[27:34] also unto her husband with her he didn't
[27:38] in the eyes of both of them were open
[27:40] and they knew
[27:41] they were naked and they threw biglies
[27:43] together
[27:44] and made themselves
[27:49] what a way to begin
[27:53] this book it's like god
[27:57] is showing us
[28:01] there's forces against you all right
[28:05] let me ask somebody a question we did
[28:07] some questions and answer dating candy
[28:09] and stuff
[28:10] let me uh let me ask you a question
[28:14] my question very important all right you
[28:16] ready
[28:17] really is really important okay
[28:21] can you get it look at genesis all right
[28:24] really what's next
[28:33] [Applause]
[28:36] this is this is metaphorically written
[28:40] for all intents and purposes this was a
[28:43] man
[28:46] a snake's camp doesn't make sense
[28:49] this was a man that came and what did he
[28:52] do
[28:54] we have to we have to set the stage here
[28:56] we have
[28:58] adam and eve adam and eve were young
[29:01] people
[29:02] they were like you all wow don't forget
[29:05] they were there we go
[29:07] they're they're the same situation you
[29:09] all are in right now
[29:11] wow and they're there and they're in
[29:14] this
[29:14] beautiful place and god had
[29:18] got it made this place for them and then
[29:21] given
[29:21] the bible says dominion over the whole
[29:24] thing
[29:24] it's like here's this wonderful place
[29:26] that you can live
[29:27] where you have everything that you need
[29:30] he says but just don't
[29:34] do this one thing all right
[29:37] just stay away from
[29:41] worldly fats just
[29:44] stay away from
[29:48] this stuff
[29:51] stay away from this other stuff but
[29:54] everything else you haven't enjoy
[29:56] yourself

[30:00] his daughter
[30:01] and he's so proud man he's up there and
[30:03] he's like yes i'm a boy you know he's

[30:23] he wants you to prosper he wants
[30:27] you to enjoy your life
[30:31] the best way to enjoy your life is to
[30:32] have that relationship
[30:34] with god
[30:45] god said you can do anything right
[30:51] maybe something like well you know you

[30:55] problem and there's this tree over here
[31:00] and it's just all right and i'm speaking
[31:04] metaphorically now
[31:06] he says there's this tree over there how
[31:08] about how about this
[31:10] and uh he's like
[31:16] so you know oh but you know it'll be fun
[31:18] it'll be great
[31:19] you know this will be really cool you
[31:21] know and we'll sneak out
[31:23] your parents and parents won't notice
[31:25] they're not going to find out
[31:27] there's a voice and his ultimate goal
[31:31] this liar he wanted to take
[31:33] you away from the lord he wanted to take
[31:37] your happiness away
[31:40] and all of these parents
[31:43] all of these elders in the church they
[31:45] will tell you
[31:47] i made this mistake and i suffered for
[31:50] it
[31:52] you've seen it i've seen it i made this
[31:55] mistake
[31:56] i suffered for it i wish i wouldn't have
[31:59] done it
[32:00] how many times did he say i wish i
[32:03] wouldn't have done
[32:04] it but it seemed so good when it
[32:07] happened
[32:10] there they are satan
[32:14] comes in and has breaks god's heart
[32:19] he's fearless and his
[32:23] son now
[32:26] now they've broken everything they've
[32:28] ruined everything
[32:29] now they're going to suffer for the rest
[32:31] of their lives because of this one sin
[32:34] that they did
[32:35] doesn't mean they were lost that's the
[32:38] thing that we forget about
[32:40] just because we sin doesn't mean we're
[32:42] lost
[32:44] it just means that we have to suffer all
[32:47] right yeah
[32:48] remember this we sin in the flesh
[32:52] and we're going to suffer in the flesh
[32:54] but your eternal destination
[32:56] does not change where you are going
[33:01] that was predestinated for ordained a
[33:04] long time ago
[33:05] but how you get there is up to you and
[33:08] you can have a hard life that's full of
[33:10] trouble
[33:12] or have a good life
[33:26] you know so often you know as
[33:29] young people when you think that you
[33:31] think maybe i'm lost or
[33:33] or whatever it is and friends let me
[33:35] tell you as long as there's a desire yes
[33:37] amen
[33:39] to serve the lord
[33:43] you know and and we preach about hell
[33:45] hell is real yeah
[33:47] but as long as there's a desire in your
[33:49] heart to serve god okay
[33:53] don't make mistakes you'll suffer from
[33:56] mistakes
[33:56] but you're okay but when that desire is
[33:59] not
[34:00] now if you don't have a desire
[34:03] that's right to serve the lord then hell
[34:05] is very
[34:06] real and hell will be
[34:09] that destination and it is not where you
[34:12] want to go
[34:14] i think everybody here i think we have
[34:18] that desire
[34:20] to serve our world in our hearts
[34:28] so then we
[34:32] we see that and
[34:36] we see that god he will send
[34:39] he will send gifts into our lives
[34:42] and these gifts you know we think about
[34:44] gifts in church we think about speaking
[34:45] in tongues and prophecy and healing
[34:48] and these things but don't
[34:51] neglect the gifts very important gifts
[34:54] that we have
[34:57] parents every one of you
[35:01] is a gift yeah to each other
[35:04] if you're helping your friends
[35:09] be a gift yes don't be disturbed
[35:16] you be a gift your parents are gifts to
[35:19] you
[35:20] when they point you to the lord jesus
[35:22] your pastor
[35:23] is a gift to you church is a gift
[35:28] this camp is a gift to all right now we
[35:30] can say
[35:32] i don't want your gifts say that
[35:36] and i believe you'll still be saved
[35:39] because you'll have a heart
[35:41] i don't want your guests i'm gonna go to
[35:43] church i don't want it
[35:45] okay all right your destination is gonna
[35:48] be the same
[35:50] but i would recommend that you take
[35:52] those gifts
[35:53] you utilize utilize those gifts yes
[35:58] because god gave them to us
[36:01] there's a uh those those
[36:04] gifts for one purpose and what they are
[36:09] we need you to have that relationship
[36:11] jesus there's a scripture that i came
[36:12] across let me turn to it real quick
[36:14] it's in mark 227
[36:18] did i read your bible i love it yeah
[36:22] mark 227
[36:28] when i came across the scripture i
[36:29] didn't i didn't understand it
[36:33] it was strange to me
[36:36] what happened was uh
[36:41] yeah that's it so what happened was
[36:43] jesus had his disciples and they were
[36:45] out
[36:46] and and they were hungry on the sabbath
[36:49] it would be
[36:49] like sunday for us is it saturday back
[36:51] then they were hungry
[36:53] so they walked into the field and
[36:54] anytime that you see corn in the bible
[36:57] you know you see corn it's not like it's
[36:59] not necessarily like corn like we know
[37:01] it's any kind of grain kind of that
[37:03] grows on an ear
[37:05] okay so so they were out and they they
[37:08] were they were in the fields and they
[37:10] were hungry
[37:11] on the sabbath day so they go out and
[37:13] and when
[37:14] the the grain is ripe what you can do is
[37:16] you can pick it you can rub it in your
[37:17] hands
[37:18] and and like the shuck comes off and
[37:21] then it just leaves the seed there
[37:22] and you gotta blow it and then you have
[37:24] just the seed they get they were eating
[37:26] they're doing that and the accuser
[37:30] the pharisees they said hey what are you
[37:33] guys doing
[37:35] they said they said you're doing this on
[37:36] the sabbath this isn't lawful
[37:39] and jesus's answer perplexed me
[37:42] the answer and and he
[37:45] could have answered according to what
[37:48] the word says
[37:49] and the word says that in the old
[37:51] testament that yeah you can go into the
[37:52] fields and you can do this
[37:54] but you can't take any out of the field
[37:56] because that would be worth
[37:57] but on sunday or on the sabbath yeah you
[37:59] can go do that but jesus didn't answer
[38:01] that way
[38:02] it was very odd the way he answered he
[38:04] answered this way
[38:06] he said in verse 27
[38:10] he said the sabbath was made for man
[38:13] and not man amen
[38:18] what an odd answer no you know what that
[38:21] means
[38:22] but what are strange things great about
[38:24] that
[38:27] lord why is that why would jesus
[38:30] answer in such a way that he could have
[38:33] answered with the word he could have
[38:35] gone back to the book of deuteronomy
[38:37] and said look here's here's the law no
[38:39] we're good
[38:40] we didn't he said the sabbath
[38:44] was created for the man for man and not
[38:47] man from the sabbath
[38:50] let me relate it to the church okay
[38:55] church isn't a place to beat us over the
[38:57] head
[38:58] and say come to church come to church
[39:00] come to church come to church
[39:02] no that's not what church is for
[39:05] they're for us they're gifts to us
[39:09] listening to tapes don't compound you
[39:12] gotta listen to
[39:13] you you're not a believer this is no no
[39:14] no no these tapes are made for us
[39:16] i can listen to them whenever i want i
[39:19] can say lord i don't want your
[39:21] gifts or i can listen to him i can take
[39:24] it in for me
[39:25] god gave it to me and the sabbath god
[39:28] knew
[39:29] that if he didn't set aside that seventh
[39:33] day
[39:34] that people would just be people and
[39:36] they wouldn't set aside a day of worship
[39:40] but yet so he said we'll do
[39:43] better if you set aside this day
[39:47] and he put it in the law and they did it
[39:49] and jesus said no this was made for us
[39:52] this was a gift to us and that's that's
[39:55] these things
[39:56] that they are the gifts to us make life
[39:59] a little bit easier for us
[40:01] to get us to the lord jesus
[40:04] and new york
[40:08] one more scripture that i want to read
[40:13] and then i want to give my testimony
[40:16] what happened
[40:18] it's in saint john chapter 14.
[40:21] now now what happened here in saint john
[40:25] jesus is coming to the end of his life
[40:32] with his disciples
[40:38] had what's called the last supper you
[40:40] know you know what the last supper is
[40:41] when jesus betrayed him
[40:47] what about if you were in his body he
[40:48] was a man
[40:50] he was god but he was god made
[40:54] flesh that's right so he was in the same
[40:56] flesh that we are
[40:59] he had the same feelings that we feel so
[41:01] he can relate to us
[41:03] he was down he knew his time was coming
[41:07] and he was like i'm gonna go away and
[41:10] how sad the lord must have been i'm
[41:12] gonna go away
[41:13] but then he says but wait wow things are
[41:16] gonna be better
[41:19] when i go away but but things are going
[41:22] to be better because i'm going to do
[41:24] something that's going to it's going to
[41:26] just
[41:27] it's going to make it all better
[41:31] i'm going to go away and they went from
[41:32] the last supper and they were walking
[41:34] down
[41:36] in jerusalem i've been there and and
[41:39] the city is built on a hill there's a
[41:41] valley a little valley that goes down
[41:44] the garden of gethsemane yosemite is
[41:46] down towards the bottom of the valley
[41:47] and it's really short
[41:49] you can you can walk there and anywhere
[41:52] from
[41:52] depending on where you are in the city
[41:54] for 15 to 30 minutes
[41:56] so so he's walking along this trail and
[41:58] he's talking
[41:59] to his disciples and he's telling them
[42:01] i'm going to leave
[42:03] but but things are going to change
[42:07] and and i'm going to do this and let's
[42:09] let's turn to verse 26.
[42:14] he says this now remember
[42:17] the situation he says but the comforter
[42:21] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[42:23] will send in my name
[42:26] he shall teach you all things and bring
[42:28] all things to your remembrance
[42:29] whatsoever
[42:31] i have said to you and she was talking
[42:34] about this mysterious thing that he
[42:36] calls the tunnel
[42:38] in other translations it's called the
[42:39] advocate
[42:42] we know it as the holy spirit
[42:45] and he's saying that i'm going to send
[42:47] this and i love you
[42:49] so much and i want to be part of you and
[42:51] and and
[42:52] and i just want i want to i want to
[42:54] always be together and
[42:55] you all always love one another
[42:59] amen and i'm talking to the parents now
[43:01] yes
[43:03] you all yes love one another
[43:06] yes i will know that you are my
[43:09] disciples
[43:10] by
[43:14] not separate churches not separate
[43:17] doctrines
[43:19] all those doctrines and all that this is
[43:20] the most important i'll know you because
[43:23] you
[43:23] love one another because you're together
[43:26] in love
[43:27] yeah say man and he tells me he warms
[43:30] them and jesus's heart is
[43:32] tearing out of him because he knows he's
[43:33] about to go to the cross
[43:35] and he says love one another and don't
[43:37] stray and he says but i'm gonna sin
[43:39] i'm gonna die i'm gonna go to the cross
[43:42] and you know what
[43:42] so are you you're gonna suffer the same
[43:45] fate that i did
[43:46] but don't forget this comforter is
[43:49] coming this
[43:50] this one is coming and he's gonna be so
[43:53] close
[43:54] to you that he's going to be inside of
[43:56] you
[43:57] not a friend that we can hold hands but
[44:00] he's going to be so close he's going to
[44:02] be inside of him
[44:03] and he will never leave you
[44:07] [Applause]
[44:14] and then jesus goes to the cross and we
[44:17] see
[44:19] the day of pentecost we see
[44:23] that happening just the way jesus said
[44:26] it
[44:27] but jesus promised it not for just his
[44:30] disciples he promised it for
[44:32] us he even prayed he said lord not just
[44:35] for these only but for all of those that
[44:37] are going to hear
[44:39] my testimony through their lips which is
[44:42] us
[44:42] yeah that's rude amen
[44:46] and he wants us to receive that holy
[44:48] spirit but then a little while later we
[44:51] see divisions start to happen
[44:54] [Music]
[44:55] but in first corinthians chapter one
[45:00] paul says he says there's divisions you
[45:03] know
[45:04] you say that i i believe i believe
[45:06] brother
[45:07] brother caleb and you say i believe
[45:09] brother joseph and they say
[45:10] i believe for the biscuit he's like
[45:12] don't do that
[45:15] he says he says was this person baptized
[45:19] were you baptized in his name
[45:21] he said don't do that paul's soul wanted
[45:23] us to go back to that day of pentecost
[45:26] where he had the holy spirit is so bad
[45:30] but that wasn't for paul to do it
[45:34] paul's job was not to turn the hearts of
[45:37] the john
[45:38] back to that of the god that was to come
[45:41] later
[45:43] and we have arrived
