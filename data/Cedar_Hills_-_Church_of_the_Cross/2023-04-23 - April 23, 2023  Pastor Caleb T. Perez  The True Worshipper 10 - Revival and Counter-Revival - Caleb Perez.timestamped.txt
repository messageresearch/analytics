[37:48] oh see it's not going to go that long
[37:51] after a while
[37:57] but uh anyways we want to get as far as
[38:00] the Holy Spirit tells us to and
[38:04] we we started a little or continued but
[38:08] but we we were hitting on the oil and
[38:10] the wine I'm going to remember last
[38:11] Sunday
[38:13] and I didn't get very far into it
[38:17] and I just kind of the message we we
[38:20] stopped when the Lord told us to stop
[38:21] but
[38:23] I wanna I wanna continue that subject
[38:27] this is the true worshiper number 10.
[38:31] we would like to put a subtitle to it
[38:36] Revival and counter Revival
[38:40] I don't know if you've ever heard of
[38:42] that phrase before
[38:45] I was kind of shocked when I was reading
[38:48] brother Branham and it came across that
[38:49] word
[38:51] I gotta be honest with you
[38:54] I had no idea what a counter Revival was
[39:02] let's see what we can do as we get into
[39:05] her see what the Lord will show to us
[39:08] if you would stand to your feet and we
[39:11] want to read
[39:13] we want to read the scripture that we've
[39:16] been reading for this subject
[39:18] John 4 23 and 24.
[39:21] but you see your beautiful faces
[39:25] and uh I know there's some people that
[39:28] are on the road God bless them wherever
[39:30] they are
[39:32] amen when you have it you can say man we
[39:35] should already know this by heart
[39:36] already huh
[39:39] amen and it is uh John 4 23 and 24 reads
[39:44] like this but the hour cometh
[39:46] and now is when the true worshipers
[39:49] shall worship the father in spirit
[39:52] and in truth for the father seeketh such
[39:56] to worship Him
[39:58] is
[40:07] a spirit
[40:09] and they that worship Him
[40:12] must worship Him in spirit
[40:15] and in truth is
[40:25] I want you to notice this now you just
[40:29] have the spirit you're out of balance
[40:32] you just have the truth you're out of
[40:34] balance
[40:36] but the father wants you to have a
[40:39] balance here
[40:40] you gotta have spirit and Truth
[40:44] Revelation 6 5-6
[40:50] when he had opened the third sill I
[40:53] heard the third be say come and see
[40:56] and I be held and lower Black Horse and
[40:58] he that sat on him had a pair of
[41:01] balances in his hand
[41:05] is
[41:15] now now notice this next verse because
[41:19] as we heard who who said hurt not the
[41:22] oil nor the wine
[41:24] they said that who
[41:28] the lamb said that right
[41:30] but if you notice the lamb also said
[41:33] what what was uh before that
[41:37] the lamb is speaking because he says I
[41:40] Heard a Voice in the midst of the four
[41:42] beasts he says
[41:44] a measure of wheat for a penny now the
[41:47] lamb is speaking
[41:49] a measure of wheat for a penny
[41:53] and three measures of bar leaf for a
[41:55] penny and see thou heard not the oil and
[41:58] the wine
[42:02] did I read that right
[42:04] is that the same voice that's saying the
[42:06] the first thing is the second thing is
[42:10] everybody in agreement here with me no
[42:13] yeah yeah okay you want to make sure
[42:17] that we that we get this right
[42:19] they got out of his blessings to the
[42:21] reading of his word you may be seated
[42:26] an interesting thing as we have read
[42:29] a voice in the midst of the throne or of
[42:34] the between the the beasts
[42:37] saying hurt not the oil nor the wine yes
[42:42] also saying a measure of wheat for a
[42:45] penny and three measures of barley for a
[42:47] penny yeah
[42:49] for there to be perfect worship
[42:53] there has to be perfect balance
[42:58] yes or yes COC one more time for there
[43:01] to be perfect worship
[43:05] there has to be perfect balance
[43:08] my brethren
[43:10] see you all right a while ago
[43:12] you're here
[43:15] so let's continue here then now this is
[43:18] this is important once again there has
[43:20] to be a perfect balance
[43:23] and that's what the lamb is saying or
[43:27] telling us
[43:29] that the way that this writer is
[43:32] measuring
[43:36] it's not a true and just balance
[43:41] in other words he's a shyster
[43:45] and the lamb is telling you this
[43:48] you gotta know when there is a true
[43:51] balance and when there's not a true
[43:53] balance
[43:56] he's trying to to achieve that in our
[44:00] lives
[44:02] because finding a balance in our lives
[44:05] is probably one of the hardest things
[44:07] that we're asked to do okay
[44:11] especially when it comes to worship
[44:15] you want to see why it is so important
[44:18] that these the lamb is talking about
[44:19] these balances
[44:22] let's find out why the lamb
[44:26] decided he had to say this himself
[44:31] don't let no one else tell it nope nope
[44:36] not the living creatures but lamb had to
[44:40] say it himself
[44:42] let's find out about this balance just
[44:45] for a moment as weak as we as we make
[44:47] this Foundation
[44:50] Proverbs chapter 11 verse 1.
[44:54] watch why the lamb this is so important
[44:57] to him
[44:59] a false balance is
[45:03] abomination to the Lord
[45:08] this is why we what we have to
[45:10] understand here
[45:12] false balance
[45:19] just wait
[45:34] let me see
[45:37] got to go work and go gotta go to school
[45:46] how to do homework
[45:50] gotta play some sports yeah
[45:55] underwater basket weaving
[45:58] got some a lot of things I'm going got
[46:00] going on but I can balance everything
[46:04] always remember
[46:06] whatever we give time to hello
[46:09] you can't give time to something or
[46:12] someone
[46:14] unless you are taking time away from
[46:16] someone or something
[46:19] yes or yes COC the more time that we
[46:23] spend on our phones and our tablets
[46:27] the last time that we spend with the
[46:29] family is
[46:32] everybody has a different mindset about
[46:34] things
[46:37] as men many times
[46:40] we think just because we're sitting in
[46:42] the same room as the family that we're
[46:44] spending time
[46:47] families
[46:50] is that not true
[46:54] all right anybody ever any men to ever
[46:56] say that what more do you want from me
[47:00] yeah you're here in the body but not in
[47:03] the your mind's not there sharing your
[47:05] Instagram
[47:06] Pakistan
[47:09] so then we start to dig into things
[47:13] where are you at and what are you
[47:15] thinking and what are you doing
[47:18] it could be the same way with the woman
[47:20] not just the man Italian
[47:25] hello yes yes it is yes but notice to
[47:29] God it's it's an Abomination when the
[47:32] when the balance isn't right
[47:36] we're giving so much time and energy to
[47:39] a lot of things
[47:42] Amos the eighth chapter and the fourth
[47:45] verse
[47:46] and watch it and I just want like I said
[47:49] just build this this platform here
[47:52] 8-4 says hear this oh ye that swallow up
[47:57] the needy
[47:58] Amelia
[48:10] [Music]
[48:43] that's the measurement of weight
[48:46] making the IFA small yes
[48:51] in other words giving a little less
[48:57] seems like that's the way when you go
[48:59] out to eat nowadays
[49:01] most of the time little bitty portions
[49:03] and the prices are way up high now hey
[49:16] that's like two two bites
[49:20] watch what they're doing that's what he
[49:22] says you make the IFA small and the
[49:24] shekel great
[49:27] and falsifying the balances by deceit
[49:31] wow
[49:35] also find the balances by deceit if I
[49:38] said
[49:39] that we may buy the poor for silver but
[49:44] the needy for a pair of shoes
[49:48] yay and Sal the refuse of the wheat even
[49:54] there's nothing worse than than knowing
[49:57] that that the balances have been
[50:00] falsified
[50:03] we look today in a world and especially
[50:06] a nation that is
[50:09] that is so out of balance
[50:12] anybody here see that
[50:15] have to live under a rock
[50:20] a nation that is out of balance
[50:24] the economy out of balance
[50:28] we live in a world of deficits
[50:36] the world of deficits
[50:38] that means that more goes out than what
[50:41] comes in
[50:43] and we we live then in a world and have
[50:46] our lives they are unbalanced
[50:50] Our Lives are out of balance
[50:54] when we come to church just whenever we
[50:57] feel like it
[50:59] our lives are out of balance
[51:03] when we don't hear the messages like we
[51:07] should
[51:10] our lives are out of balance
[51:12] we don't read the word of God like we
[51:15] should our lives are out of balance
[51:21] what we have eaten has thrown our
[51:24] hormones out of balance
[51:28] because of that we got so much more mood
[51:31] swings
[51:34] and grouchy people what's wrong with you
[51:38] nothing
[51:40] what's going on how to balance
[51:43] when we're not at peace what's going on
[51:46] we're out of balance
[51:48] when there is no joy in our soul what
[51:51] are we we're out of balance
[51:55] that's right when there is no love and
[51:59] long-suffering
[52:01] more gentleness
[52:05] we're a people that are out of balance
[52:09] our minds are out of balance
[52:13] what causes a mind to be out of balance
[52:18] brother Branham says nervousness
[52:23] causes your mind to be out of balance
[52:28] Justice is out of balance
[52:32] we see that everywhere
[52:35] how many of you would like to be judged
[52:38] by an by a balance that is that is has
[52:42] been falsified
[52:53] governments are out of balance
[52:56] churches are out of balance
[52:59] families are out of balance
[53:04] we look at that and we think that we
[53:06] have to live like that
[53:08] but I'm going to tell you again what the
[53:11] scripture just said
[53:14] false balance
[53:20] National
[53:22] hello everybody hola todos what I think
[53:25] it is
[53:26] but there has to be a people
[53:30] there has to be a True Believer
[53:33] a true worshiper
[53:36] that can maintain the balance of God's
[53:39] word
[53:41] you and I cannot survive without balance
[53:47] we can't survive
[53:50] without balance
[53:53] it is so important just an important
[53:56] that we understand balance in our lives
[53:59] that we keep a balance
[54:03] Ezekiel 45 verse 10 says this is
[54:09] ye shall have just balances
[54:14] and adjust IFA
[54:17] and a just bath
[54:20] if you keep on reading this whole
[54:22] chapter and I'm and I don't have time to
[54:24] do all that
[54:26] you'll find out in this chapter
[54:30] how to calibrate your balance
[54:34] right we sometimes that's what we need
[54:37] we need to calibrate the balance
[54:40] here is here is a maybe the Center Post
[54:44] he says
[54:47] starts to go one way or the other well
[54:49] you gotta slide it over
[54:52] they have to calibrate it where it is it
[54:55] becomes stable and even
[54:58] now once we know that like I said read
[55:02] that chapter and you'll understand it a
[55:04] little bit more
[55:05] but we don't ever want to be judged by a
[55:08] falsified balance
[55:11] but we know that God's judgments are
[55:15] true
[55:17] God's judgments are true
[55:21] and so it was shown yes and I'm just
[55:25] going to give you the the scripture you
[55:27] can write it down and and read it later
[55:31] but in the Book of Daniel the fifth
[55:33] chapter
[55:36] 25-27.
[55:37] there was a king by the name of
[55:40] belshazzar
[55:42] who was put in God's balance
[55:46] right and but you have read that before
[55:57] many many
[56:00] that's right now now everybody remember
[56:03] the story
[56:04] and the the the the the interpretation
[56:08] of this
[56:09] is that God has numbered thy kingdom
[56:14] and finished it
[56:17] Thou Art weighed in the balances
[56:30] I think today is a good day
[56:34] come on the balances
[56:37] find out what we are lacking
[56:41] if our if our life is in Balance
[56:46] this means that we're lacking something
[56:50] but I don't want to continue just to
[56:52] live like that
[56:54] I want to know what I'm lacking
[56:59] terrible conditions
[57:01] to think that you're balanced
[57:04] and then you're found lacking
[57:08] think that your life is going great
[57:11] but you're found lacking
[57:14] what a horrible condition
[57:17] when we do not measure up to God's word
[57:22] that's why job in in the 31st chapter
[57:27] you know he says verse 6 he says let me
[57:30] be weighed this and the vessel says
[57:34] in an even balance
[57:38] that God may know mine Integrity
[57:43] now when we take the word balance
[57:46] and we bring it into the message
[57:49] we take it into the Scriptures
[57:55] it simply means that we know how to
[57:59] rightly divided
[58:02] yes see okay come on we got to know
[58:06] these things to balance something
[58:09] means that you know how to rightly
[58:12] divide it
[58:14] it don't matter what it is whether it's
[58:18] your money yes
[58:20] whatever it may be you must learn how to
[58:24] rightly divided
[58:28] now there is a story are you in a
[58:31] Historia maybe you've you all have heard
[58:33] it is
[58:38] now Pancho Villa didn't
[58:41] rightly divide everything
[58:44] at all we have to make sure
[58:48] he didn't do everything right okay now
[58:51] here's a story about one of the times he
[58:53] did do something else
[58:56] and it was said that one of his generals
[59:00] was trying to take advantage of a
[59:03] married woman
[59:07] entered her house
[59:09] she began to scream
[59:12] and her husband who was working out in
[59:14] the field
[59:16] he heard her screaming
[59:20] he came in running to protect his wife
[59:26] the general that was in the house
[59:29] shot and killed the husband but this is
[59:33] when Pancho Villa heard this
[59:36] he called for the woman to come and
[59:41] General
[59:44] now that doesn't sound very just yet huh
[59:49] says you're going to marry him
[59:51] and of course he told the general
[59:55] I have a gift for you
[59:59] and when you when you bring me your
[1:00:02] marriage license
[1:00:06] made sure that that he went they went
[1:00:09] down to the courthouse
[1:00:11] wherever they got married
[1:00:13] the woman screaming and yelling didn't
[1:00:16] want to get married
[1:00:19] she was forced to marry the general
[1:00:22] foreign
[1:00:53] lomaton and now he told the woman
[1:00:57] since you're legally
[1:00:59] is
[1:01:03] all his possessions are now yours
[1:01:08] you think about that is there pins in
[1:01:10] there Aaron every now and then we can we
[1:01:13] can get it right there is
[1:01:16] but it's so hard for us to to make
[1:01:20] proper judgments and and balance things
[1:01:26] the reason being is that is is that
[1:01:29] we're too caught into our emotions
[1:01:35] and the moment we we try to serve the
[1:01:38] Lord under feelings and emotions
[1:01:42] balance is off already
[1:01:45] hello are you with me when we try to to
[1:01:50] serve the Lord
[1:01:51] right to judge something
[1:01:54] but but we said well yeah but I don't
[1:01:57] really like them
[1:01:58] your balance is awesome it's not based
[1:02:02] upon whether you like somebody or you
[1:02:03] don't understand
[1:02:08] have to make sure you calibrate your
[1:02:11] balance
[1:02:13] if you don't then your balance is an
[1:02:16] Abomination
[1:02:20] I'm there with me
[1:02:22] second Timothy the second chapter and
[1:02:25] the 15th verse says
[1:02:28] study to show thyself approved unto God
[1:02:35] a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[1:02:41] rightly dividing the word of Truth
[1:02:46] friends brother Branham says this day
[1:02:50] I've always tried to keep a balance of
[1:02:54] the road
[1:02:57] you get away off into formalism
[1:03:01] just as formal and ritualistic as they
[1:03:04] can be yeah
[1:03:07] because people grab for that a lot he
[1:03:09] says
[1:03:11] but then if you don't watch it
[1:03:15] plumber
[1:03:17] Plum oversized
[1:03:19] and you'll be just as a fanatic as can
[1:03:22] be
[1:03:23] he said but there's a middle of the road
[1:03:27] where the true sound
[1:03:31] same gospel evangelios
[1:03:37] God moves in there is
[1:03:44] the gates
[1:03:50] very few there be that will find it
[1:03:54] now now let's stop for a minute
[1:03:57] because in all reality this is why
[1:03:59] people cannot balance things out
[1:04:03] Jesus said you by your Traditions
[1:04:07] you make the word of God of no effect
[1:04:10] now now you have two schools of thoughts
[1:04:13] watch watch this
[1:04:14] is just as an example
[1:04:16] two schools of thought when people come
[1:04:19] to the message
[1:04:21] you have this school of thought here
[1:04:23] yeah
[1:04:24] it says when you come to the message
[1:04:28] give your heart to the Lord this is what
[1:04:32] you got to do
[1:04:33] you've got to stop drinking
[1:04:36] you gotta stop smoking you gotta stop
[1:04:39] wearing clothes
[1:04:43] you have to stop doing all these things
[1:04:47] so here is one thought or or one group
[1:04:51] of people
[1:04:53] then you have this side
[1:04:57] that'll tell you you don't have to do
[1:05:00] nothing
[1:05:01] let the Lord take it off away from you
[1:05:07] two schools of thoughts
[1:05:09] this morning which one do you choose
[1:05:13] that you got to do all these things or
[1:05:19] kick back and not worry about nothing
[1:05:23] anyways God will take care take it away
[1:05:25] from him
[1:05:27] Where Do We Go From Here
[1:05:30] both are the word that has not been
[1:05:33] rightly divided
[1:05:36] because there's something that that when
[1:05:39] you look at this picture it's wrong
[1:05:43] these ones are trying to do everything
[1:05:45] to to make it home
[1:05:49] care less yes
[1:05:59] because there's something that we gotta
[1:06:02] do okay
[1:06:04] leave it all on God
[1:06:07] here you come to the altars
[1:06:10] those of you and and we would have to go
[1:06:13] back to the old to the Old Testament to
[1:06:15] to show this is
[1:06:18] the Old Testament in the
[1:06:35] this is where many people don't get it
[1:06:39] now now here we come
[1:06:44] is my buddy
[1:06:47] okay now dear brother Yandel he decides
[1:06:51] to give his heart to the Lord
[1:06:55] ready say hi to him welcome him yeah
[1:07:01] you feel welcomed oh
[1:07:04] he comes to the Altar
[1:07:07] and he says I've accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:07:11] and that's all he he says that's it and
[1:07:15] he says he's ready to go huh
[1:07:18] you see the problem is El problema is
[1:07:22] that people don't realize
[1:07:23] that when you come to the altar
[1:07:26] it's not good enough to come up to the
[1:07:29] altar
[1:07:31] you have to make the choice
[1:07:34] that's why you can't just leave it on
[1:07:36] God
[1:07:37] you've got no choice to get on the altar
[1:07:40] oh no no lay down
[1:07:43] it's your choice
[1:07:47] you can lay down
[1:07:50] and lay on the altars
[1:07:53] because this guy
[1:07:57] he's accepted the Lord
[1:08:00] but there is a burning process that has
[1:08:03] to happen
[1:08:08] burn the sin away
[1:08:11] he's got to climb up on the altar
[1:08:13] foreign
[1:09:04] now there's a process because now you
[1:09:06] got to go to the next step
[1:09:09] but I'm trying to show you something
[1:09:11] here
[1:09:12] it's easy it is not to rightly divide
[1:09:15] the words
[1:09:19] if you don't rightly divide the words
[1:09:22] and you'll just go with anything
[1:09:25] I just felt so good in church
[1:09:31] felt good when you watch that movie
[1:09:35] but I cried in church you're in English
[1:09:38] and you cried on that movie Yes
[1:09:40] you cried when somebody said something
[1:09:43] bad towards you
[1:09:45] what does that mean you cried
[1:09:48] and I laughed
[1:09:52] good nothing wrong with that
[1:09:54] have you died
[1:09:59] you've got to come to the place that you
[1:10:01] present
[1:10:02] Domingo
[1:10:30] is
[1:10:57] at least they're honest now yeah yeah
[1:10:59] all right
[1:11:00] Manos
[1:11:04] but you know what Eros 7K when we decide
[1:11:08] I don't think I'm gonna go I got a
[1:11:10] backache today
[1:11:12] my leg hurts
[1:11:15] oh this is going on I don't feel like
[1:11:17] going
[1:11:18] the same way that you present your body
[1:11:21] a Living Sacrifice to God
[1:11:25] you are also presenting your body a
[1:11:28] Living Sacrifice to Saiyan
[1:11:32] no you have just laid on the altars
[1:11:38] I am
[1:11:40] oh
[1:11:49] you're either presenting yourself to one
[1:11:52] or the other president
[1:11:54] hello hola
[1:11:57] when you open up and you start watching
[1:11:59] pornography
[1:12:02] what are you doing you're telling
[1:12:05] sayings I present myself to you
[1:12:12] hello well if you're looking at another
[1:12:14] man or another woman what do you do
[1:12:40] watch what he says here
[1:12:50] but there is a middle of the road
[1:12:53] where the true sound same gospel is
[1:12:57] preached
[1:13:00] indicates his word
[1:13:02] so if that's the case
[1:13:05] then let's see where we need to be today
[1:13:10] when he comes there's something that God
[1:13:14] can't do it he gave you a free will to
[1:13:18] choose
[1:13:20] it's important to rightly divide the
[1:13:23] word it's important
[1:13:25] the word is tightly divided
[1:13:31] stimulation of the Revelation comes
[1:13:36] you can rightly divide the words
[1:13:40] we try to find balances in our lives
[1:13:45] but we end up compromising
[1:13:51] instead of rightly dividing it
[1:13:56] as a minister
[1:14:14] yet we neglect the very families that
[1:14:18] God's given us
[1:14:23] are we rightly dividing
[1:14:26] la palabra
[1:14:29] oh this one
[1:14:31] even brother Caleb has to go
[1:14:38] undo this a little bit
[1:14:40] oh yeah
[1:14:42] we become Workaholics
[1:14:46] of ourselves and
[1:14:50] still yet others are just Pleasure
[1:14:53] Seekers
[1:14:55] and have no responsibility to anyone
[1:14:59] else
[1:15:01] where's the balance in our life
[1:15:07] our worship is out of balance
[1:15:11] oh my goodness I'm going to say it again
[1:15:14] our worship is out of balance
[1:15:18] why the Lord doesn't move like this
[1:15:24] and when he moves a little bit we're
[1:15:26] satisfied with that
[1:15:29] I am not satisfied with just a little
[1:15:32] move
[1:15:34] I want all that God has given us
[1:15:39] all that he's promised foreign
[1:15:47] brother Branham says that Faith creates
[1:15:50] the promise
[1:15:53] let's go on here
[1:15:56] now
[1:15:57] to bring up this faith in Christ
[1:16:02] there's ministers this is Brother
[1:16:05] Branham in the message I perceive you
[1:16:07] are a prophet
[1:16:09] to bring up this faith in Christ there's
[1:16:11] ministry
[1:16:15] that's the most important thing of the
[1:16:18] day is the most important
[1:16:22] come on you want to balance let's get a
[1:16:25] balance here
[1:16:27] that's the most important thing of the
[1:16:30] day is
[1:16:32] a good god-sent preacher
[1:16:35] um
[1:16:36] brother Brown says I admire them
[1:16:40] and their gift is far beyond anything
[1:16:46] that could be done in anything else
[1:16:51] is a preacher a man who knows how to
[1:16:55] rightly divide the word
[1:16:59] he knows how to bring balance
[1:17:02] that's why the bride is the only people
[1:17:06] on earth
[1:17:08] that is balance
[1:17:13] the bride La Novia he's the only people
[1:17:17] that is balance
[1:17:20] you know why
[1:17:33] all right making sure
[1:17:37] that's what we're talking about
[1:17:40] balance doesn't exist just for balance
[1:17:43] sake
[1:17:46] it does not exist to Crown itself King
[1:17:49] no existence
[1:17:51] and control our lives
[1:17:54] with an intimidating set of rules
[1:17:59] no no balance does not exist to make us
[1:18:02] feel guilty in Balance
[1:18:05] traded or defeated
[1:18:09] balance exists to serve us
[1:18:14] now Church did you get that balance is
[1:18:18] here to serve us
[1:18:20] oh I pray that we get this this morning
[1:18:24] then why do people have a problem with
[1:18:27] balance
[1:18:29] because they have a problem with the
[1:18:32] Center
[1:18:33] El Centro
[1:18:35] if the center's not right the balance is
[1:18:38] not right
[1:18:40] and we're always changing our centers
[1:18:44] all right amen this is the center of
[1:18:48] your life
[1:18:50] my boyfriend is my Center oh no
[1:18:57] looking at these young people oh my
[1:19:00] girlfriend she's the center
[1:19:03] until we get dumped
[1:19:06] did I say that loud
[1:19:09] I wasn't supposed to say that out loud
[1:19:12] until things don't work out
[1:19:16] my life is ruined
[1:19:19] what happened you had the wrong center
[1:19:24] Christ should be the center
[1:19:27] your home of your life of your thinking
[1:19:30] of everything that you are
[1:19:33] if the center is unstable the balance is
[1:19:36] awesome
[1:19:38] answer must be Christ
[1:19:42] be the word
[1:19:44] because even in the face of lost jobs
[1:19:50] lost jobs
[1:19:52] lost marriages
[1:20:03] lost retirement
[1:20:07] God never changes
[1:20:10] he's still stable he's still the same
[1:20:12] time
[1:20:14] he is our Center
[1:20:16] it don't matter if the whole world falls
[1:20:19] apart
[1:20:21] we have what sustains us foreign
[1:20:41] let's see what is required for worship
[1:20:47] the wine and the oil okay young people

[1:21:52] are the staff of life
[1:21:55] [Music]
[1:22:00] okay did you get that now oil and wine
[1:22:04] connected in worship
[1:22:06] weed and barley are the staff of life
[1:22:11] foreign
[1:22:39] and here they are charging for
[1:23:04] which causes an imbalance
[1:23:08] and so the people don't know uh I ain't
[1:23:11] gonna serve God all they want is money
[1:23:12] in that church yes
[1:23:17] people I've ever thought that or said
[1:23:19] that or
[1:23:20] amazing
[1:23:23] they're charging for the staff of life
[1:23:28] but to start off with
[1:23:31] God had already promised a land for his
[1:23:35] people
[1:23:38] you can read it read this at home but
[1:23:40] Deuteronomy 8 7-10
[1:23:44] he promised us uh
[1:23:47] a
[1:23:49] land that had balance
[1:23:54] Ahmad
[1:23:56] am I losing you no
[1:24:02] promised us a good land
[1:24:05] for the Lord thy God bringeth thee into
[1:24:07] a good land foreign

[1:26:06] I can no more die than God can die
[1:26:11] well what's the problem
[1:26:15] imbalance
[1:26:17] that's the problem
[1:26:19] sometimes we feel good
[1:26:23] I'm talking about anybody here
[1:26:33] a land
[1:26:38] with wine
[1:26:40] a land with
[1:26:48] a
[1:26:51] the land has all this
[1:26:54] you're not excited
[1:26:59] foreign
[1:27:03] yeah
[1:27:05] excited are you excited
[1:27:08] is your neighbor excited
[1:27:13] she we should be the most excited people
[1:27:19] what a land but because of sin and
[1:27:23] Disobedience
[1:27:25] let's see what happened to this Lando
[1:27:33] feels good to preach with no time limits
[1:27:37] we're going to see how much how many of
[1:27:40] you can handle it
[1:27:42] our pastor would say support
[1:27:59] pero when they're watching a movie
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:05] Coke right here
[1:28:07] and then a big old hot dog
[1:28:11] it's already over shoved that was such a
[1:28:14] good one let's put another one
[1:28:17] that's the flesh it says that's an
[1:28:21] imbalance
[1:28:25] hear you old men hear this ye old man
[1:28:27] and give ear this is Joel 1 2.
[1:28:31] the inhabitants of the land have this
[1:28:33] been in your days or even the days of
[1:28:34] your fathers
[1:28:37] tell your children of it and let your
[1:28:39] children tell their children their
[1:28:41] children another generation
[1:28:44] watch what has happened to or what
[1:28:47] happened to the good land
[1:28:49] that which the Palmer worm hath left
[1:28:55] and that which the Locust has left
[1:29:00] and that which the canker worm has left
[1:29:03] the caterpillar
[1:29:07] awakey drunkards desperate and weep and
[1:29:11] Hell
[1:29:12] All Ye drinkers of wine
[1:29:15] because of the new wine accounts for it
[1:29:19] is cut off from your mouth
[1:29:23] watch verse 10 now the field is wasted
[1:29:28] come on how many of you know you are
[1:29:46] the oil languages
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:56] how will all ye Vine dressers for the
[1:30:00] wheat and for the barley brothers
[1:30:05] because the Harvest of the field is
[1:30:08] perished
[1:30:09] in other words you're not producing
[1:30:13] anymore
[1:30:15] your land is dried up
[1:30:20] what a condition
[1:30:22] this is the condition of many of fields
[1:30:26] Campos the new wine now you need this
[1:30:30] for worship
[1:30:32] the new wine
[1:30:36] how are you going to worship
[1:30:41] there's no more stimulation of
[1:30:43] Revelation
[1:30:46] hmm
[1:30:49] oh are we going to be honest with
[1:30:51] ourselves this morning
[1:30:53] do we just want a a message to just make
[1:30:56] us feel good
[1:30:59] we're not here for that
[1:31:01] the new wine is dried up
[1:31:04] the oil language
[1:31:07] it's become feeble and weakness
[1:31:13] the wheat and The Barley
[1:31:16] which should have been the Harvest
[1:31:21] in other words there's an imbalance in
[1:31:24] the ecosystem
[1:31:30] Echo the ecological system
[1:31:34] right there's an imbalance
[1:31:36] things aren't flowing the way they're
[1:31:38] supposed
[1:31:43] let's go on to see what it is
[1:31:47] you know what is wrong
[1:31:58] thank you uh anybody here lost their Joy
[1:32:04] no
[1:32:06] the joy of
[1:32:08] thy salvation David said
[1:32:11] they've lost their Joy because if the
[1:32:15] word of God is not new every time you
[1:32:17] hear it
[1:32:19] there's no joy
[1:32:23] you lost it when the word of God becomes
[1:32:27] old
[1:32:34] amen oh my goodness God help us this
[1:32:36] morning
[1:32:37] that's why the oil and the
[1:32:45] oil and the correctly measured in the
[1:32:47] balance
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:49] because instead of producing
[1:32:53] taking the ingredients
[1:33:01] what have they done with the barley and
[1:33:04] wheat
[1:33:05] they have made a drink of intoxication
[1:33:11] the very same ingredients that that's
[1:33:14] used to make bread
[1:33:17] is now used to make whiskey now
[1:33:20] whiskey oh don't you understand and see
[1:33:23] now
[1:33:24] the great
[1:33:27] all the inhabitants of the world have
[1:33:29] been made drunk
[1:33:32] what should have been a preaching
[1:33:35] what should have been preached
[1:33:37] what should have been Jesus Christ
[1:33:43] being produced into the
[1:33:49] they've turned it into an intoxicated
[1:33:52] drink
[1:33:56] oh
[1:33:57] they're in trouble
[1:34:00] what we need is a Revival
[1:34:05] what we need is a counter Revival
[1:34:09] say it again we need a Revival this is
[1:34:17] now we're getting into our message
[1:34:20] that's all that is for this
[1:34:23] now how many want a Revival
[1:34:26] how many have a Revival already
[1:34:29] the Revival should be inside of you
[1:34:32] want everybody point to themselves the
[1:34:36] Revival should be in here already
[1:34:39] a Revival is not how much you jump and
[1:34:42] shouts
[1:34:43] that Revival is to revive what's already
[1:34:46] inside
[1:34:50] now let me let me just put this out for
[1:34:52] you okay
[1:34:53] he says
[1:34:59] it doesn't consist of bringing in new
[1:35:01] members
[1:35:05] now if we just say it like that
[1:35:08] we're not rightly dividing the words
[1:35:11] our Revival is not for new members
[1:35:18] let's rightly divide it
[1:35:22] a Revival doesn't consist of a bunch of
[1:35:25] conversions
[1:35:28] although those things go along with the
[1:35:31] Revival
[1:35:43] is there a revival going on here
[1:35:47] what good is it if it's for Africa but
[1:35:50] not for you
[1:35:55] oh come on what are we trying to give if
[1:35:58] we don't already have it yeah
[1:36:02] yeah
[1:36:03] conversions it goes along with the
[1:36:06] Revival conversion is
[1:36:07] what a Revival is to revive what you've
[1:36:10] already got Uno
[1:36:15] America brother Branham says America
[1:36:18] this is
[1:36:19] needs a Revival
[1:36:22] and a counter Revival
[1:36:24] he said but they're not gonna get it
[1:36:28] why because they send away their day of
[1:36:32] Grace
[1:36:38] I don't care how much they pray for this
[1:36:41] nation
[1:36:43] 1956.
[1:36:45] in the way their day of Grace it must
[1:36:49] not be saved we cannot be saved as a
[1:36:51] nation
[1:36:55] there still is a people
[1:36:57] who live here in the United States
[1:37:01] and our Revival is going on inside
[1:37:05] it is active it's an existence
[1:37:13] we have become the laughing stock of the
[1:37:17] whole world
[1:37:20] how many how many how many saw that of
[1:37:22] our vice president going to Africa
[1:37:26] Africa real nice
[1:37:30] yeah you gotta you gotta start you're
[1:37:33] taking into consideration these people
[1:37:34] and it is
[1:37:39] they laughed in her face
[1:37:45] yes or yes nobody else saw it yeah
[1:37:48] these presidents of the of these
[1:37:50] different African countries they laughed
[1:37:51] in her face
[1:37:56] because they see the immorality
[1:38:00] the decay of the morals in our country
[1:38:05] this is the Mexican president
[1:38:09] he said the United States
[1:38:12] they're not concerned about well-being
[1:38:16] they own their only concern about the
[1:38:18] money
[1:38:20] they're telling us
[1:38:22] what the imbalance is
[1:38:27] they do not strengthen moral because
[1:38:35] spiritual values
[1:38:38] nor do they limit drug use
[1:38:42] contrary they encourage it
[1:38:46] said the U.S moral compass has gone awry
[1:38:55] they are suffering from moral Decay is
[1:39:02] yeah
[1:39:04] this is
[1:39:05] the country we live
[1:39:08] we understand
[1:39:10] we don't need a new Pentecostal
[1:39:13] denomination
[1:39:16] a message
[1:39:19] no sir God forbids
[1:39:22] we don't need a new denomination
[1:39:26] we need to revive
[1:39:30] what we have denominated
[1:39:41] the thing that we've denominated
[1:39:48] that's exactly what we need it's a
[1:39:51] sacramental looking it's a good
[1:39:52] old-fashioned Revival
[1:39:55] knows that's true
[1:39:57] and then he says Revival is sometimes
[1:40:00] misunderstood
[1:40:03] because they think it's just to bring in
[1:40:06] new members
[1:40:08] again no no Revival result is that
[1:40:16] Revival results is the new members
[1:40:21] the Revival is to revive what's already
[1:40:24] in the church
[1:40:27] so the great things that we're after for
[1:40:30] any Revival
[1:40:33] says there's four things
[1:40:35] number one Numero Uno in a Revival
[1:40:39] is to bring lost souls to Christo
[1:40:45] this is the message speak to this
[1:40:46] mountain
[1:40:49] lost souls to Christ first
[1:40:53] then revive number two revive the church
[1:40:56] back into a spiritual conditions
[1:41:02] what should be close communion with God
[1:41:07] number three is to bring Fellowship
[1:41:11] among the churches
[1:41:13] and then he says at number four
[1:41:17] pray for the second
[1:41:19] and that's not just physical that is
[1:41:22] spiritual
[1:41:24] that's our aim he says
[1:41:27] oh he said I thought it's having a
[1:41:30] Revival what does it do
[1:41:33] it shakes all the trash out this is
[1:41:38] Iglesia
[1:41:50] no nobody likes to hear these messages
[1:41:56] um okay I've been going a long time
[1:41:59] yeah and I just should I just call it
[1:42:01] quits now you sure all right
[1:42:06] make sure that you're in
[1:42:10] watch what he says here a minister
[1:42:13] cannot bring a Revival um
[1:42:20] there's no preacher that can bring a
[1:42:23] Revival
[1:42:25] I'm gonna invite these preachers over
[1:42:27] here man they're gonna man they'll just
[1:42:29] bring us a Revival
[1:42:32] teacher can bring a Revival
[1:42:35] doesn't pack it with him
[1:42:41] for all those that oh yes
[1:42:44] I go many places do many things
[1:42:51] sometimes we gotta slap ourselves
[1:42:57] a preacher doesn't have that he doesn't
[1:43:00] pack it
[1:43:02] the only thing a preacher can do is be
[1:43:04] loyal to God
[1:43:08] oh yeah now we're getting somewhere be
[1:43:12] loyal to his words
[1:43:14] and the Revival has to come by the
[1:43:17] people
[1:43:19] because it's either the people are going
[1:43:22] to believe it or they're not
[1:43:25] sure you want a Revival but you gotta
[1:43:28] believe it
[1:43:30] here's Jesus
[1:43:33] that that that that stimulation begins
[1:43:37] to flow out
[1:43:40] Jesus
[1:43:43] which of you can accuse me of sin
[1:43:47] who can accuse me of unbelief
[1:43:51] everything that the prophets have spoken
[1:43:55] I have fulfilled it
[1:43:58] which of you can excuse me
[1:44:02] and brother Branham turns it now you
[1:44:05] know
[1:44:06] that's what the Pentecostal church
[1:44:08] should be saying
[1:44:14] for everything that the New Testament
[1:44:17] was written
[1:44:20] we are fulfilling what it has been
[1:44:23] written
[1:44:25] oh who then can accuse us
[1:44:32] if you're not producing it don't be
[1:44:36] accused of not believing it
[1:44:39] is
[1:44:43] especially when the balances have been
[1:44:46] made perfect
[1:44:50] now watch this now efficacy
[1:44:53] it needs watch we all get
[1:44:58] we must come to a place where we are
[1:45:00] clean
[1:45:03] the word revive
[1:45:06] means to
[1:45:08] bring back
[1:45:12] right
[1:45:13] listen that was alive at one time but
[1:45:16] now it's bring it's brought back is
[1:45:21] put those two words
[1:45:29] why Reviving restores
[1:45:33] most exactly the same is makosa
[1:45:38] restoration means to bring back
[1:45:40] restoration is
[1:45:43] to bring back to the former owner
[1:45:47] to bring back to a former state of
[1:45:49] condition or conditions
[1:45:52] and revive means to bring back
[1:45:57] or restore to life
[1:46:01] to restore
[1:46:03] energized
[1:46:15] once again and here's where we're going
[1:46:17] with the message
[1:46:18] says we need a Revival this is
[1:46:29] I don't know what that even means
[1:46:34] I don't know what that means
[1:46:38] but thank God for a problem
[1:46:43] there's no other place he said I'd
[1:46:44] rather live he said
[1:46:49] because this is my home
[1:46:52] I'm glad I'm an American
[1:46:55] thankful for it
[1:46:58] but I tell you
[1:47:01] it certainly needs a counter Revival
[1:47:06] it sure does and it will not get it
[1:47:11] no she'll never rise again
[1:47:15] she's gone
[1:47:21] counter Contra means in the opposite
[1:47:26] direction
[1:47:29] it's something that opposes or prevents
[1:47:32] something
[1:47:34] what opposes or or prevents a Revival
[1:47:40] a counter Revival
[1:47:43] why would we need a counter revised
[1:47:47] when we all want a Revival
[1:47:50] what's the purpose of a counter Revival
[1:47:54] I mean we go perfect strength by Perfect
[1:47:56] weakness
[1:48:00] then God can achieve his purpose
[1:48:04] by sending not a Revival
[1:48:09] but brother better counter Revival
[1:48:12] remember Revival is to revive
[1:48:17] he says but God's purpose is
[1:48:21] to achieve his purpose foreign
[1:49:23] be with him
[1:49:27] amen and I gotta say the same thing
[1:49:31] Tabernacle needs a killing necess
[1:49:36] a killing of ourselves
[1:49:42] so that we can be revived in a new life
[1:49:49] A New Hope
[1:49:51] you experience
[1:49:54] we need first a day of mourning
[1:50:00] there's a time to cry
[1:50:03] at a time to laugh but we need a day of
[1:50:07] mourning
[1:50:09] we've Gotta Die out completely
[1:50:14] we need a place of yielding to the
[1:50:17] spirit
[1:50:19] instead of so much depending on
[1:50:22] schooling and upon programs
[1:50:26] so that we can get away from that
[1:50:31] get away from the human ability
[1:50:35] we gotta go to a place where we can
[1:50:40] surrender our souls and lives
[1:50:44] even to the housewife
[1:50:47] the farmer the mechanic
[1:50:51] whoever we are we gotta surrender
[1:50:54] completely to God
[1:50:57] know that we are nothing
[1:51:01] then let God start from there
[1:51:05] oh then he's moving
[1:51:08] you've got to die before you're born
[1:51:10] again
[1:51:12] there were many people we have failed I
[1:51:15] are you getting it this morning
[1:51:19] come on
[1:51:20] put yourself in the balance of God's
[1:51:22] word
[1:51:24] which side are you is it
[1:51:33] the true worship
[1:51:37] is right
[1:51:38] the true worshiper must be restored
[1:51:43] the fields Los Campos the trees
[1:51:49] the wheat The Barley
[1:51:52] all must be restored
[1:52:09] there is a people that has been revived
[1:52:14] I don't know about you but that excites
[1:52:18] watch what a revival can do please
[1:52:21] it needs a Revival a counter Revival
[1:52:25] what is the purpose of the counter
[1:52:27] Revival is
[1:52:29] to straighten up some of the things
[1:52:32] that's in the church
[1:52:35] and in the lives of the people
[1:52:40] anybody here want to counter Revival
[1:52:41] this morning
[1:52:45] I'm inviting you for a counter Revival
[1:52:50] things that got to be straightened out
[1:53:00] things in people's lives
[1:53:02] what a thing it is then when God raises
[1:53:07] it brings a Revival
[1:53:10] in the Philadelphia Church age
[1:53:13] how many know have ever studied the
[1:53:15] French Revolution
[1:53:18] the things that were going on in France
[1:53:26] brother Brown says free thinkers this is
[1:53:30] a revolution broke out
[1:53:33] brother said what they needed was a
[1:53:36] counter Revolution
[1:53:38] Contra revolution
[1:53:45] this revolution in France
[1:53:50] it was during the time
[1:53:52] of the great Wesleyan Revival
[1:53:56] Wesley now this is tremendous
[1:53:59] you have France over here
[1:54:03] it was called the reign of terror right
[1:54:08] you can go study it's called the reign
[1:54:11] of terror
[1:54:13] it was against the government
[1:54:15] against the church it was against the
[1:54:18] monarchy
[1:54:20] everybody was getting getting a little
[1:54:22] piece of it
[1:54:24] but notice brother Brown says
[1:54:27] this revolution is the revolution would
[1:54:30] have surely taken all of England
[1:54:36] what a Revival that broke out in England
[1:54:42] that Revival in English
[1:54:45] started with a prayer meeting
[1:54:49] if you think that that prayer doesn't
[1:54:51] work
[1:55:19] this is what John Wesley's Journal said
[1:55:23] in a journal they were Wesley brother
[1:55:26] and presents he called it a love Beast
[1:55:33] and about three in the morning
[1:55:36] [Music]
[1:55:39] I don't know about you you know but here
[1:55:43] pretty soon I'm gonna invite whoever
[1:55:45] wants to come
[1:55:46] pray all night
[1:55:50] if you don't want to pray all night stay
[1:55:52] at home
[1:55:55] okay let me see who will come
[1:56:00] oh I got a baby
[1:56:03] can't go sorry
[1:56:07] would you take care of my baby
[1:56:12] imbalance yeah
[1:56:19] I'm looking at all of you
[1:56:23] what we got going on here
[1:56:28] he said that it fell with such amazement
[1:56:31] the power of God
[1:56:33] that we all broke out with one voice
[1:56:38] we praise thee Oh God we acknowledge
[1:56:41] thee to be the Lord
[1:56:45] now he hears what's tremendous to me
[1:56:49] because when all these free thinkers
[1:56:54] see that's so evident now
[1:56:56] all these free thinkers
[1:56:59] where they get these things
[1:57:05] [Music]
[1:57:08] first they start with tolerance
[1:57:11] you got to tolerate them even if you
[1:57:13] don't agree with them
[1:57:16] tolerance it goes to acceptance
[1:57:22] and after acceptance it comes they come
[1:57:25] to Promotions
[1:57:28] promoting it now all right
[1:57:32] and that would have hit England at that
[1:57:34] time
[1:57:37] but there was a revival going on
[1:57:40] that kept that revolution in France
[1:57:45] God would not let it come into England
[1:57:50] brother Branham says it was the
[1:57:53] Evangelical Awakening in England
[1:57:58] that from that prayer meeting
[1:58:02] It produced the greatest preachers and
[1:58:05] teachers that this world has ever seen
[1:58:09] that's what we need today keep on with
[1:58:12] the Holy ghosts
[1:58:16] stand up and say that's not right
[1:58:20] this is black and black and white as
[1:58:23] white
[1:58:24] where are those people
[1:58:26] if a Revival back there did that
[1:58:30] it's more a Revival
[1:58:33] a fruitful word has been restored into
[1:58:37] the churches
[1:58:49] foreign
[1:58:52] [Applause]
[1:59:00] because when I hear something wrong and
[1:59:02] I walk away and don't say nothing
[1:59:06] there ain't nothing there ain't a
[1:59:08] Revival why not
[1:59:09] you can't help but call out sin nope
[1:59:13] oh where am I at now
[1:59:16] I still got a few minutes
[1:59:21] so glad
[1:59:23] today is a good day oh yes
[1:59:25] now I have to understand this though
[1:59:30] that every Revival
[1:59:33] produces twins
[1:59:40] I'm in Revival
[1:59:42] praise God look out for that twin
[1:59:48] that's what the counter Revival is all
[1:59:51] about is
[1:59:54] to counter is it the effects
[2:00:01] oh are you are you getting it now
[2:00:05] say it again that's what the counter
[2:00:08] Revival does
[2:00:10] it puts the other twin at Bay this is
[2:00:15] the other twin doesn't have the effect
[2:00:18] on you that it wants you okay
[2:00:21] by some people oh I'm in a Revival
[2:00:25] they don't even know if they love the
[2:00:27] Lord
[2:00:29] there was no counter Revival
[2:00:34] every Revival produces twins
[2:00:37] when the world was created it was a
[2:00:40] Revival
[2:00:42] you know that anytime God creates it's a
[2:00:46] Revival
[2:00:48] what did that Revival in the beginning
[2:00:51] produce
[2:00:53] they produce two trees
[2:00:55] the tree of life and the tree of
[2:00:58] knowledge
[2:01:01] another Revival produced Cain and Abel
[2:01:04] another Revival produced Ishmael and
[2:01:07] Isaac is
[2:01:12] Jesus and Judas
[2:01:16] Christ and the Antichrist Christo
[2:01:24] the Luther church was born the Lutheran
[2:01:26] Church
[2:01:27] Martin Luther brought forth a spiritual
[2:01:30] Revival Martin
[2:01:32] but then the organization came and
[2:01:34] organized it organization
[2:01:37] John Wesley brought a spiritual Revival
[2:01:41] then the organization came again and
[2:01:43] organized It
[2:01:46] pentagos produced a Revival
[2:01:49] they also organized
[2:01:52] but brother Branham says this oh I like
[2:01:55] this
[2:01:56] he said but this revival
[2:02:00] usually a Revival lasts for three years
[2:02:04] he said but this revival
[2:02:08] lasted over 15 years
[2:02:12] and it cannot be organized it can be
[2:02:16] organized 15 years
[2:02:18] it can't be organized
[2:02:24] instead
[2:03:13] let's let's
[2:03:15] try to go and finish up here yes
[2:03:21] the Holy Spirit and the
[2:03:24] antichristo is to be twins
[2:03:29] in the same church they're walking
[2:03:31] together
[2:03:36] oh yeah
[2:03:37] in the same tree yeah right now right
[2:03:40] now they're both working
[2:03:41] the Holy Spirit saying listen oh yeah
[2:03:45] put yourselves on the scales of God's
[2:03:48] words
[2:03:55] you're okay as well you're going to
[2:03:58] heaven
[2:04:00] both working with you right now
[2:04:03] what are you doing about it
[2:04:06] oh my goodness
[2:04:09] those are good things to think about
[2:04:12] where are we vamos
[2:04:15] this is what he says
[2:04:18] the prophet of God is
[2:04:21] it Billy Graham yeah Billy is a word
[2:04:24] preacher Billy is a grandma is
[2:04:33] a Dandy one you know bien and they
[2:04:37] rallied around
[2:04:38] so that put all the cold Formals in a
[2:04:42] rally frios
[2:04:47] foreign
[2:04:56] this is a whole different game now
[2:04:59] and now and the supernatural being yes
[2:05:04] with Divine Healing and powers and
[2:05:09] working and so forth yeah see by The
[2:05:12] Miracles of God
[2:05:15] put this
[2:05:17] the church the raptured bride La Novia
[2:05:22] that's not God the oil in her lamps
[2:05:26] and put her in a Revival
[2:05:30] not Billy Graham's message
[2:05:33] even though he preached from the word
[2:05:36] so this is not just preaching from the
[2:05:39] word
[2:05:40] a man that could rightly divide it
[2:05:44] watch watch this now
[2:05:48] that when we come to an understanding of
[2:05:51] this
[2:05:52] to this promised restoration I stopped
[2:06:30] yea the Lord will answer and say unto
[2:06:33] his people
[2:06:35] only two places in the scriptures
[2:06:39] this wording used
[2:06:42] behold I will send you
[2:06:47] there is only two places he says
[2:06:51] behold I will send Caleb corn
[2:06:57] I will send Caleb the wines
[2:07:03] he will be satisfied there with
[2:07:06] and I will no more make him a reproach
[2:07:09] among the heathens
[2:07:12] the only other place that he says behold
[2:07:15] I will send you
[2:07:18] four five
[2:07:25] with a message to rest restored
[2:07:29] to restore what to restore the oil
[2:07:41] I will restore saith the Lord
[2:07:45] this is a prophecy from our founding
[2:07:48] pastors
[2:07:52] watch listen closely now this is
[2:07:54] prophecy now
[2:07:57] oh yeah
[2:07:59] you didn't know who was in your Midstate
[2:08:01] he said for many years he said I have
[2:08:05] brought something to this place
[2:08:09] now it's time for the other ones to
[2:08:12] water it
[2:08:15] these ministers
[2:08:18] okay where's our ministry talking
[2:08:23] these ministers are not going to water
[2:08:26] on their own
[2:08:29] they're only going to water
[2:08:32] which I already placed there
[2:08:36] what is placed here he says
[2:08:39] watch this now
[2:08:41] I cannot do no more
[2:08:45] I've given everything I've got tengo
[2:09:11] there has to be a harvest
[2:09:14] there has to be a reaping
[2:09:17] there has to be a gathering
[2:09:20] but we cannot do it
[2:09:24] on just a plantation
[2:09:28] it's got to be watered
[2:09:32] that's why you see me
[2:09:35] you're not going to see me in this
[2:09:38] church
[2:09:40] going forth anymore
[2:09:43] going to start going back
[2:09:47] I'm going to start diminishing regular
[2:09:55] but my ministers
[2:09:57] are going to start increasing in here
[2:10:02] and they're going to water yeah
[2:10:05] they're going to reap
[2:10:08] that which they did not plan okay
[2:10:10] there's no plantaron
[2:10:16] I heard in the midst of the four beasts
[2:10:19] a measure of wheat for a penny
[2:10:23] three measures of barley foreign
[2:11:22] okay we're coming down just give me like
[2:11:24] 10 minutes okay and I'll be through
[2:11:27] he says we wouldn't need a healing
[2:11:30] service
[2:11:31] not need any salvation altar calls
[2:11:36] it would be finished
[2:11:38] if you just realized what the word was
[2:11:44] When I See This I say wow wow
[2:11:49] can we get there
[2:11:51] can we get to Perfection
[2:11:54] come on Church who wants to go to
[2:11:56] perfection
[2:12:01] we say no
[2:12:03] many said when the when the prophet
[2:12:06] passed away no
[2:12:10] the perfect interpretation has come
[2:12:17] and there is a people
[2:12:20] who believe it
[2:12:23] then who can accuse us of sins
[2:12:28] who can accuse us of
[2:12:31] sinus
[2:12:34] yes
[2:12:36] there's a people that is manifesting
[2:12:39] what was spoken by the prophets
[2:12:43] listen to this he can say tell you you
[2:12:46] talk about a perfect worship
[2:12:49] the oil and the wine continues
[2:12:55] foreign
[2:13:58] this is what he said
[2:13:59] for these men will carry these
[2:14:04] the innkeepers
[2:14:07] that will take these sick people
[2:14:12] and
[2:14:15] they'll keep pouring in the oil and the
[2:14:18] wines
[2:14:25] help we ministers Lord
[2:14:28] that we might be able to serve your
[2:14:30] people with a pure conscience
[2:14:39] act like that doesn't
[2:14:41] existed or can somebody take the
[2:14:44] responsibility
[2:14:48] other pastors
[2:14:53] they said they're pastors to feed you
[2:14:56] and to Shepherds
[2:14:59] until Jesus comes
[2:15:02] not just for a short short time
[2:15:05] this is the message be certain of God
[2:15:08] these men are good men
[2:15:13] he says join their churches
[2:15:17] they'll do you good
[2:15:19] I can only be an
[2:15:21] Evangelista
[2:15:24] he says but they're pastors to feed you
[2:15:28] until Jesus comes
[2:15:32] they are the caretakers at the end
[2:15:36] that Jesus gives them two pence
[2:15:42] the word and the spirit Espiritu
[2:15:48] that the true worshiper would Worship in
[2:15:51] spirit and in truth
[2:15:54] they need anything else
[2:16:06] anybody here that's sick
[2:16:11] sister there you are
[2:16:14] who else is sick again
[2:16:21] there's a few that are sick
[2:16:24] watch how we rightly divide this word
[2:16:26] and then I'm going to finish here
[2:16:32] Paul says to the Hebrews
[2:16:35] therefore living the principles of the
[2:16:38] doctrines of Christ
[2:16:39] let's go on into Perfection
[2:16:42] not laying again the foundation of
[2:16:44] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[2:16:46] toward God
[2:16:51] Hebrews 6 1.
[2:17:01] of the doctrine of baptisms and laying
[2:17:04] on of hands and of resurrection of the
[2:17:06] dead and of Eternal judgment
[2:17:10] this we will do if God permits
[2:17:13] Paul knows that these things are
[2:17:16] absolutely Essentials
[2:17:41] but show me in the scriptures
[2:17:44] one Gentile that Jesus prayed foreign
[2:17:53] you won't find it
[2:17:54] we'll do these things if God permits
[2:17:58] the balance because
[2:18:00] there's many people
[2:18:02] who are not there you don't have the
[2:18:05] faith they need a touch
[2:18:08] this
[2:18:11] God permits but if we're talking about a
[2:18:15] mature Church
[2:18:17] a church that wants to go to Perfection
[2:18:21] then let's see what this kind of what
[2:18:24] kind of church this is to be and this is
[2:18:26] now
[2:18:29] my purpose has been this is the message
[2:18:32] go away
[2:18:34] my purpose has been in the church
[2:18:37] is to try to get that idea
[2:18:42] away from these American people
[2:18:46] that you have to lay hands on them
[2:18:53] and this will do if God permits yes
[2:18:58] when you do that they say well brother
[2:19:02] so and so laid their hands on me
[2:19:04] so the Brown says Just Let Jesus lay
[2:19:08] hands on you
[2:19:11] and your faith reach up and touch him
[2:19:15] but our faith is too weakness we can't
[2:19:19] reach out and touch him
[2:19:22] watch watch what he says here this is
[2:19:25] November of 1963.
[2:19:28] now I've had about 16 years
[2:19:33] and I've totally failed with it
[2:19:40] she
[2:19:41] you know why because there there are too
[2:19:45] many
[2:19:46] that wants to believe it another way
[2:19:50] and so we do it because we satisfy the
[2:19:54] people
[2:19:56] okay
[2:19:59] we will do this if God permits
[2:20:03] we satisfy the people and we lay hands
[2:20:07] my opinions
[2:20:09] that if we can see the presence
[2:20:13] and know that Jesus Christ is here
[2:20:17] what more do you need
[2:20:20] when the whole congregation is praying
[2:20:23] at one time
[2:20:26] that's when the power of the Lord Falls
[2:20:30] when the word is known
[2:20:33] Faith cometh by hearing this is
[2:20:37] hearing of the word and when the word is
[2:20:41] being preached
[2:20:48] that should do the work right there
[2:20:54] come on now he said let's go to
[2:20:57] Perfection how many want to go to
[2:21:00] Perfection okay
[2:21:04] then I'm gonna ask again
[2:21:06] who's sick today
[2:21:11] I challenge you to stand to your feet
[2:21:16] because the same one that gave me this
[2:21:17] message
[2:21:18] is the same one that's here we don't
[2:21:22] have to guess we don't have to hope
[2:21:26] is as a group as a Believer
[2:21:30] is we gotta Pray when we pray the
[2:21:35] presence comes
[2:21:36] let your faith Reach Out And Touch him
[2:21:40] we're too used to put in hands
[2:21:44] they let your faith reach out
[2:21:49] maybe you need a Revival
[2:21:52] maybe you need a counter Revival
[2:21:55] today is our day
[2:21:58] I challenge you today today is our day
[2:22:02] if you've gotten cold and indifference
[2:22:05] today is your day
[2:22:10] let your faith touch him this morning
[2:22:13] you need something stand to yourself
[2:22:15] foreign
[2:23:15] by the Bible
[2:23:31] as we pray together
[2:23:34] and the presence of God now that is here
[2:23:37] already
[2:23:41] you're laying on the balance now
[2:23:44] if you're found lacking then receive
[2:23:48] what you what you are lacking
[2:23:51] if you need whatever it is
[2:23:56] and father in Jesus name
[2:23:59] oh Lord God
[2:24:02] there are people here Lord I hate you
[2:24:05] Lord
[2:24:07] Lord there are people that are watching
[2:24:10] online Lord
[2:24:12] that need a touch from you
[2:24:15] Lord our faith is is now reaching out to
[2:24:19] you Lord
[2:24:22] just by the power of spoken words
[2:24:26] Lord you hear their prayers Lords
[2:24:31] they're crying to you this day
[2:24:35] I pray Lord Jesus
[2:24:39] Lord that your presence now that is here
[2:24:43] we're going to answer the prayers of
[2:24:46] your people
[2:24:48] Lord let us go to a higher level
[2:24:52] just knowing that you spoke the word
[2:24:56] everything that's written in the
[2:24:58] scriptures
[2:25:00] everything that you spoke up through a
[2:25:03] prophet is ours
[2:25:07] that their faith begins to move
[2:25:10] Lord let it move Lord
[2:25:16] Jesus oh yes oh see
[2:25:21] do you believe in church
[2:25:23] don't you let go until you got something
[2:25:26] here
[2:25:29] make it worthwhile that you came to
[2:25:31] church today
[2:25:34] I just want to end with this now
[2:25:37] here's Gordon Lindsay from a man sent
[2:25:40] from God
[2:25:42] Paul writes we look not at the things
[2:25:46] which are seen
[2:25:49] But at the things which are not seen
[2:25:53] for the things that we see are temporal
[2:25:57] things which are not seen are Eternal
[2:26:01] Paul shows us here
[2:26:04] that we are now living in Two Worlds
[2:26:08] at the same time
[2:26:10] the physical world or the world of sense
[2:26:15] and the world of spirit
[2:26:18] the world of spirit El Mundo de spirit
[2:26:21] to surrounds and Sierra and Spears
[2:26:27] an interpenetrates
[2:26:30] the world of sense
[2:26:34] Both Worlds
[2:26:36] occupy the same space
[2:26:39] at the same time
[2:26:41] so now I ask you
[2:26:44] every every Revival produces twins
[2:26:50] it produces the carnal produce
[2:26:53] and it produces the spiritual believer
