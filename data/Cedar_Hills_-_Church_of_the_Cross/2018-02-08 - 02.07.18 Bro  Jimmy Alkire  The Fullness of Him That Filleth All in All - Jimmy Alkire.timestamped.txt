[17:25] [Music]
[17:47] but the tarsal almost up you know
[18:17] your recently I was up in Colorado and I
[18:21] was standing up on a mountain and I was
[18:23] watching an old mother Eagle as she
[18:26] brought her little ones from the nesting
[18:28] on her wings and set them down in a
[18:31] grassy pasture and then she flew back up
[18:34] to the top very peak of the highest rock
[18:37] she could get food and she sat down she
[18:40] began to watch well I was watching to
[18:44] Bubba knockers my harsh look hitched to
[18:46] a tree and I was watching and I said
[18:48] Laura I like this and it seemed to me
[18:51] that I smell it is ever around the
[18:54] eagle's nest and then make it out a
[18:56] sharp sticks and things and a portal
[18:58] Eagles we're just walking on those
[19:01] sticks and sawing they never know nothin
[19:04] else but one day the mother spread forth
[19:06] her wings and they stepped on the wings
[19:08] and went out now I looked at those
[19:11] little fellows and they were just having
[19:13] a a Pentecostal revival they were just
[19:18] running around all nuts all grass just
[19:21] picking here and a trip into one another
[19:23] and jumping over each other just as free
[19:26] as they could be I thought well that's
[19:27] right now there is like a man in the old
[19:31] nests of the world knows nothing but
[19:34] that what the devil can get me but one
[19:37] day God picked him up to set him down
[19:39] and the shady green pastures oh hi
[19:45] rejoices he's free there's nothing no
[19:48] harm I thought well why does little
[19:50] fellows afraid wonder if they realize
[19:52] there's coyotes around that would pick
[19:54] them up what ever watched a wild they
[19:57] would look up and the old mother was
[19:59] sitting up there watching them well
[20:02] praise be to God that's right he taking
[20:06] me out of the nest of the world and he
[20:07] climbed the ramparts of glory
[20:09] betting on
[20:10] watching over his heritage the seasonal
[20:14] harm come I thought if a coyote would
[20:17] start Tour titles illegal she'd flogging
[20:19] today now hope that's right let's take
[20:22] you take a true believer and he's got
[20:23] Jesus Christ on his hands that's right
[20:26] let him take after a while she was
[20:28] watching her create majestic head
[20:32] looking around she's on the high rock
[20:34] that she could find course she could see
[20:36] everywhere her sharp eagle eyes watching
[20:39] and after Augustine her raise her head
[20:41] through my pimp our binoculars I seen
[20:44] her raise her head and look around she's
[20:46] within the air I thought what is it wait
[20:48] back in the North a northerner started
[20:51] the thunderlord
[20:52] she let out a scream and down through
[20:55] there she went rogue forth those big
[20:57] wings got out on that grassy Prairie and
[21:00] every one of those little Eagles ran
[21:02] over real quick they were instructed
[21:04] perhaps before leaving the nest
[21:06] they caught their little feet got in the
[21:08] feathers so their little mouths down to
[21:10] a pill hooked it around the feather and
[21:11] she raised with that bunch of Eagles on
[21:14] her wing and left at this straight
[21:16] piercing net wind blowing nearly fifty
[21:18] miles an hour then right into the path
