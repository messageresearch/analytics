[11:38] what's the what's the deal huh tell me
[11:40] who's doing good here everybody all
[11:45] right all right well let's get started
[11:46] we got a lot of traveling to do today
[11:49] I know it's windy but I think we can
[11:52] make some good time are you all going to
[11:53] sit up here and watch me or I do you
[11:56] want to take a seat I need all this room
[11:59] you got to get down all right let's see
[12:03] here break the ice
[12:07] yeah we did that welcome to the
[12:10] laboratory of God God's laboratory this
[12:17] is where faith without works is dead and
[12:22] I'm gonna make a t-shirt of that I think
[12:25] that'd make a good t-shirt so how many
[12:27] brought your Bibles if you can't you can
[12:31] go home if you didn't bring it
[12:33] why have it if we're not gonna read it
[12:35] right
[12:35] all right let's open
[12:37] Bibles we're going to turn to Matthew
[12:45] 16:25 and the first one to get it will
[12:51] be a okay the first one is a rotten egg
[12:57] but I'm looking for the second one to
[12:58] get it actually all right stand up and
[13:03] you can read it further for whosoever
[13:09] will save his life shall lose it uncle
[13:13] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[13:17] shall find it Amen so let's all repeat
[13:20] that because it sounds a little tongue
[13:21] twister like it's almost saying
[13:23] something that it's not but it really
[13:25] does so let's all read it ready you
[13:28] repeat after me for whosoever shall
[13:33] shall save his life shall lose it and
[13:39] whosoever and whosoever will lose his
[13:46] life for my name's sake will find it and
[13:53] that's the key there is for my name's
[13:56] sake because as we heard this morning
[13:58] you can do a lot of things in life well
[14:00] if it's not for his name sake it does
[14:03] not matter at all okay so we're going to
[14:08] learn a little story today how many have
[14:11] heard of Zacchaeus or Zacchaeus anybody
[14:15] oh there we go okay so I got three
[14:22] things that he was he was we he was
[14:26] little and he was a man all right come
[14:30] on if you're in God's laboratory you
[14:32] have to be ready to have some fun and
[14:34] learn some things about God how many are
[14:36] excited or should I rename my lab to
[14:39] Andy's lab you know why I think that's
[14:43] the name of God I think his name's Andy
[14:48] you know I
[14:50] what about that song and the walks with
[14:53] me and he talks to me no okay all right
[15:00] okay so let's get right into our time
[15:10] travel we got to open the scriptures so
[15:13] let's turn to Luke 19 I need some water
[15:18] my teeth are stuck into my lips okay
[15:26] give me a second sword let me get some
[15:28] water and by the way if we're the Julius
[15:35] is watching I got the baby tie on it's
[15:39] an inside joke they were baby ties I
[15:42] were a baby tie okay so I'm going to
[15:48] read this one okay to make better time
[15:53] that's what all the brothers do there
[15:55] when they'd like something they go oh so
[15:58] that's a moment okay and we're going to
[16:03] read this and close your eyes I want you
[16:05] to really imagine this because this
[16:08] happened one week
[16:10] well the week before Jesus was crucified
[16:14] he was going through a town called
[16:16] Jericho and it says and Jesus entered
[16:21] and passed to Jericho and behold there
[16:23] was a man named Zacchaeus which was the
[16:26] chief among the publicans and he was
[16:28] rich and he sought to see Jesus who he
[16:32] was and he could not for the press
[16:34] because he was a little of stature and
[16:36] he ran before and climbed up into a
[16:39] sycamore tree to see him for we he was
[16:42] to pass that way and when Jesus came to
[16:44] the place he looked up and said to him
[16:48] Zacchaeus make haste
[16:50] come down for today I must abide at thy
[16:53] house and he made haste and came down
[16:56] and received him joyfully and when they
[16:59] saw it and when all the other people saw
[17:01] it they murmured saying that he was
[17:04] want to be a guest with a sinner and
[17:07] we're going to stop right there okay so
[17:11] we heard this morning that brother
[17:13] Branham was always searching for God in
[17:16] the mountains and anywhere he would go
[17:19] he was always searching well that's
[17:22] pretty much what Zacchaeus was doing he
[17:24] was searching for God because you see
[17:27] Zacchaeus had a very good wife who
[17:31] wanted Zacchaeus to serve the Lord but
[17:33] Zacchaeus he was a rich man he would go
[17:36] play putt-putt with the priests
[17:39] he'd go play volleyball and he was also
[17:42] a great man you know he'd wave like this
[17:44] when he'd go through town and and he
[17:47] would go and do special things for
[17:48] people and they do things for him and
[17:50] you know he would he just wasn't good
[17:52] with everybody in the city so Zacchaeus
[17:55] kind of built himself up but he was
[17:57] short so he wasn't he was a big man
[18:01] stuck in a little body I think we know a
[18:05] few of those people and so Butler so
[18:10] this man Zacchaeus he started to realize
[18:15] that even though he had all this he had
[18:17] friends he had all the things going for
[18:20] him
[18:20] but yet he had a wife at home who was
[18:22] always praying lord I pray that she
[18:25] would help my Zacchaeus to come to see
[18:27] you to know you and to know him like I
[18:30] know you and and that he would fill that
[18:32] emptiness inside of his heart with with
[18:35] you and so one day
[18:38] Zacchaeus got home and and he just
[18:40] wasn't the same normally Zacchaeus was
[18:42] playing around a real jokester but that
[18:45] night he was serious he went straight to
[18:47] bed sucking his thumb and curled up in
[18:49] his bed and his wife said what's wrong
[18:51] with you Zacchaeus oh nothing I don't
[18:53] want to talk about it but she knew
[18:55] because God answers prayers and brother
[18:58] Branham says the prayer of a wife or
[19:02] even a mother will do more than a
[19:05] preacher on the pulpit and so God will
[19:08] hear you the prayers of your mother I
[19:10] know you don't have wives yet and I know
[19:13] you don't have husbands yet but you'll
[19:16] get there one day
[19:16] thanks to the prayer
[19:18] years of your mother so what goes
[19:19] hand-in-hand so that night Zacchaeus was
[19:22] tossing and turning he took some nyquil
[19:24] didn't do nothing
[19:26] yeah it made him stay up even longer so
[19:29] he got up early that morning he's like
[19:32] you know I'm gonna go to McDonald's give
[19:34] me a McMuffin and I'm just gonna you
[19:36] know because Jesus was gonna be coming
[19:38] through there because he was going on
[19:40] his way through Jerusalem where he was
[19:42] later on he's crucified so he was
[19:45] passing and he said I must stay right
[19:47] here because I can see exactly when
[19:49] Jesus comes so he was sitting there
[19:51] drinking his cosmic coffee in and he was
[19:54] he owned the McDonald's actually come to
[19:57] think of it that was his McDonald's and
[19:59] he was sitting right in front of Burger
[20:01] King just watching it because that was
[20:03] his arrival because I should be the
[20:05] Burger King this guy don't know nothing
[20:07] so he was sitting there and here comes
[20:11] Jesus with his disciples
[20:12] oh I'm gonna see what this guy is all
[20:13] about he comes into my town and he
[20:17] thinks he can just do miracles and read
[20:19] people's minds and I'm gonna see what
[20:21] he's about so you know he sits there and
[20:23] he's drinking his coffee and Jesus goes
[20:26] into Burger King and he says oh that I
[20:30] don't even know I can't believe that
[20:33] slimeball who owns Burger King would
[20:36] invite Jesus into his restaurant why
[20:38] wouldn't he come to mind mine's better
[20:40] and the thing was he never invited Jesus
[20:43] so Jesus will only go where he's invited
[20:46] and you've got to invite him into your
[20:48] place give him all that you got but the
[20:52] Burger King owner he invited Jesus so
[20:55] they were more than happy to go there so
[20:58] he sat there and he was all stood up and
[21:00] he was thinking how he could even get
[21:03] back to see Jesus again so he thought
[21:06] well you know what Jesus will be going
[21:07] down this straight Boulevard right here
[21:10] and I'm gonna go and I'm gonna catch him
[21:12] on the other side so Zacchaeus jumped
[21:15] out and he took off his awful of
[21:17] caffeine and he runs and he's standing
[21:19] there he should be going anymore well
[21:21] all kinds of people started coming like
[21:23] a big parade and he was a kiss in the
[21:25] back trying to look and he couldn't see
[21:27] anything because he was a wee little man
[21:30] exact year
[21:31] was a wee little man we let no man was
[21:35] he okay we'll get the rest in a bit so
[21:38] he started walking over there and he
[21:41] couldn't see anything all these people
[21:43] were oh he thought he was in the Land of
[21:45] Nod all these giants but really they
[21:47] were only about five foot so he must
[21:50] have been smaller so as he was looking
[21:53] for these people or he was waiting for
[21:55] Jesus to come and he thought I'm never
[21:58] going to see him this is he says bogus
[22:01] what am I gonna do so he looked to his
[22:04] right and he saw a big tree kind of like
[22:08] this exactly it looked just like this
[22:14] three and he thought huh
[22:16] you know his wheels started turning in
[22:18] his head and and he thought huh maybe I
[22:23] could hide up here oh and and then Jesus
[22:27] says he's a mind reader and he knows all
[22:30] this stuff maybe I'm feeling this tree
[22:31] and let's see how much he really knows
[22:34] let's see if he really knows I'm hiding
[22:37] in there
[22:37] so what Jackies did is he I need a
[22:43] helper who can climb trees like a monkey
[22:47] no you don't have to climb too high I
[22:49] don't want you to break your neck
[22:50] come here all right so what Jackie is
[22:55] did you only have to come to about the
[22:59] second step here and peek your head
[23:03] right through this little hole just like
[23:09] that and hold this so he was standing
[23:15] there like that and he was waiting for
[23:19] Jesus to come because he knew he was
[23:21] going to come sometime because there was
[23:23] only one way in one way out and so can I
[23:26] get some more helpers I'm going to need
[23:29] some disciples so let me get you
[23:32] gentlemen
[23:33] or you can come and what of the Branham
[23:37] says that Paul was a big man and he was
[23:41] protecting Jesus so you're going to be
[23:43] Jesus and you're going to act
[23:44] really
[23:45] because you've been praying for people
[23:47] all day virtue is pulled out of you and
[23:49] all you want to do is go eat and get
[23:52] some sleep so let me get this big brute
[23:54] here this is your party girl
[23:57] this was poor little wimpy I trained him
[24:02] myself because I'm professor Gamaliel so
[24:06] what he did was he led them up and all
[24:11] the while Zacchaeus was in the tree and
[24:15] they stopped here and out of nowhere
[24:18] where's our little girls there's Ali I
[24:21] have her baby that's who I was thinking
[24:24] of come here don't help me I need some
[24:28] help let her borrow your baby then come
[24:30] on you both King come when all of the
[24:33] sudden a little girl comes to Jesus
[24:36] saying my baby it has a fever can you
[24:43] pray for my baby Jesus well Paul wasn't
[24:49] so kind he said no he's tired he's tired
[24:56] you you surely would say please Jesus
[25:00] pray for my baby it has a fever so at
[25:06] that moment Jesus raised up his head and
[25:09] he said bring the baby to me and all he
[25:13] did was he touched the blanket that's
[25:15] all he had to do and the baby came back
[25:17] to life and she ran home happy so you
[25:20] guys can take your seat so over here
[25:27] it's all good everything is nice and
[25:30] beautiful but over here he is going
[25:32] through a storm in his mind because he
[25:34] just built Jesus up to be some kind of
[25:36] mean evil person well yet he just saw
[25:39] this little baby get her healing so at
[25:41] this point he's thinking man I wish he'd
[25:44] come my way I really didn't want to see
[25:47] him at first but I do now so they came
[25:50] and right under the tree Jesus stops and
[25:55] he says that yes come down
[25:59] from that three seconds come down
[26:01] factory so here comes a kiyose with
[26:04] tears in his eyes and i believe i don't
[26:08] know if you believe this pause the scene
[26:10] but brother Branham says Jesus had a
[26:14] face so powerful that if he would speak
[26:19] the world would just end but yet it was
[26:22] so sweet and kind that it was just
[26:26] beautiful and I believe he's looked into
[26:29] those eyes and his heart just melted
[26:32] like wax and he came through Jesus and
[26:35] he gave him a big hug
[26:36] and he said Lord I want to follow you
[26:40] and if I've ever done wrong please
[26:43] forgive me I will give back to the poor
[26:47] what I have stolen and I want to be a
[26:49] better person and from that day on
[26:52] Zacchaeus served the Lord you guys can
[26:55] have a seat thank you so that's what's
[27:06] so beautiful about this story is that
[27:11] Zacchaeus had climbed up his three of
[27:13] pride he thought he was so great but yet
[27:18] Jesus just simply called him down and
[27:19] Jesus never even knew Zacchaeus or he
[27:24] didn't know or I shouldn't say that he
[27:28] had never met Zacchaeus before but the
[27:30] Spirit of God that was in him lose a
[27:32] kiss from before the foundation of the
[27:34] world and he stopped right there and he
[27:36] called them down by his name and that's
[27:39] what's so beautiful
[27:40] is that the Lord knows each and every
[27:42] one of you and he calls you by name and
[27:44] he makes you one of his disciples to
[27:46] follow him and that's what's so great
[27:49] about this so how many want to sing the
[27:52] song with me we're going to sing
[27:54] Zacchaeus was a wee little man all right
[27:58] but you got to stand up
[28:01] all right ready there's some little are
