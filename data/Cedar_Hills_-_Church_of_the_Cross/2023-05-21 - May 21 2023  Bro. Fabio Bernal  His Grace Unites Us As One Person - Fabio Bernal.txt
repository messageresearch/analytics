Glory hopefully it's been dedicated exclusively to the Eternal Eternal Word of God thank God I have a small thought yes I pray that we can share of what God already said all right uh the holy spirit said through Peter that for you to know all things we always will remind you the same things it's like at home they'll remind you every day make you bad because we always live it a mess the Lord tells us every day why we come to the house of the Lord is better Brothers better parents better friends we are the best of all that's why we come here we don't fail the Lord is his house in your home area we come to hear how to walk daily let us World prayer beloved God it's a great privilege for me to stand in this sacred place you're thrown in heaven you placed it on Earth where two or three will gather in United States you'll be amongst us yes it's through the angel okay the Republic to Gloria your power and your glory through your world help us this morning that you run and be glorified they fulfill the purpose that is let's go to two basic scriptures Zechariah 4 7. then we're going to go to Ephesians chapter four two scriptures are identified even with the same and the seventh age 47 who are thou o gray Mountain before the rubber bed thou shall become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings Brian Grace Grace unto it was good Ephesians 4 7. very use scripture in the pulpits foreign the Lord says in that word in his word visions according to every one of us is giving Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ that's our desire this morning Uno those that were assigned to foreign it was given Grace [Music] they live in disgrace yeah what portion of Grace was assigned to them ladies and Senor the Lord says according to the measure of the gift of God here's what we read that the gift of where manifestado was manifested in his third office form of the Holy Spirit do you say it's a spirit God is a spirit for God to be able to speak to us because the word comes to a prophet for he is the Holy Spirit and the William Brothers where he only has one Brides that is I to what Grace were you assigned to why not many believe in the father so others believe in the song in the Holy Spirit the grace upon Grace house the building Don de dios where God was going to Crown his body what's going to be in the United States of America it is in the dollars and we don't even know who we are became the most hated nation in the world America and even like that everybody wants to come to America where there's hate but it's not for them because they know the crown of the pyramid is here they knows more about God he'll really hears than a religious Now read the Bible every day foreign there's no Grace upon Grace where God has called you Wednesdays and even Grace reached them there has to be Grace Sovereign and for me you want to find yourself there or outside of it says if you don't see your image you're not going to go the place that you read it you have to be identified as Isaiah 53 Los prophetas de la Gracia destinada which the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who preach of the great state unto you so Grace is not loose it has a destination if they ask where's brother calebel he's in Phoenix well what's the route for that destination LDS Highway I'm gonna go through I'm going to take the 10. if I want to go to work if you don't recognize your place you're not going to find your destination come to Sunday school is to look at the Players see how much is written about you because a Blackboard is foreign so the need to come to service prophesy of the grace that should come unto us this was not for the prophetamines because I already have her believe it foreign diligently your Eternal destination because maybe your faith is as crooked as the store here this is not my thinking this is the prophet laid it out he is The Interpreter of the word interest searching what the first thing you need to know is where this message came from foreign upon Grace is searching what what manner of time the spirit of Christ was which was in them did signify the scripture says captivity captive is gifts and Men as those of William of your salvation the Lord or you don't believe his presence in human flesh respect [Music] foreign [Music] with dignity [Applause] the identification stores to give you the Holy Spirit the tears of repentance but you didn't repent it is we got 48 years uh seen and hearing this again everyone and contagious does not receive the Holy Spirit just become a member in sin in the in the pew because the Holy Spirit should go with us everywhere you know when the Holy Spirit leaves you when you go to the wrong place and he starts again to do the first words discipline is we testify beforehand the sovereign foreign that's the job of a pastor is to bring to the people the knowledge and the revelation of who is the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit came in that's what William brand ministers and pastors and so forth you have the Holy Spirit to deliver it to the people and to maintain yourself that is ordained of the Bride that is but search for the bride because it's time of the of the a wedding of the Lamb so we have to search and dress the bride yes so to find one bride you have to bring a hunter is and you know God Only God knows who of the 100 is the one fantastic in fact oh it's easy to distinguish the person that is born again the one that claims to have been born again the one that says that has it all is lacking all hello this is the Lord unto whom it was revealed Administration they're not unto themselves but unto us they administer the things that are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from him foreign because Christ means the anointed man Christina Christ and Christine and Christina's aura and to know that this doesn't come by foreign important to you by them that preach the gospel unto you by the holy ghosts who's the one that brings the right announcement to you the dreams that brings to you the announcement of the Holy Spirit by the scriptures many are like like doing like poetry they just recite things people that memorize the Bible but they don't know what the church is Sent From Heaven Sent down from heaven so the Holy Spirit has to be sent who does he send it to um with the same responsibility and to say that saith the Lord you stay God Prophet Ministry you I feel like yo to it that's how the the verb it is is brought down personal pronouns otos Us and Them like those that are in Colombia like so the verb he comes down the Tower and the place where the Holy Spirit has been known what what is the Holy Ghost he said he is the word today foreign you as head of the household ERS you want to see the Holy Spirit come back to your home restore your family altar but what about the altar dios primero Sorry God first above course all things they asked me to preach forgive me but this is what God says your pastor why look at my mom what I like about this is that this is that the angels can do nothing being in heaven the Bible itself Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which thinks these things that the Angels desire to look and we reject we see it so normal oh I read it I believe oh it speaks until Christ lives but to have him it's life I didn't know that understand it had loins reproduces children our bodies we have loins outside and inside the loins running back because I want to go to this Starbucks coffee would you at home with your family and a prayer of Thanksgiving familiar that in the family but the holy spirit will visit us you could be a help to others God gave you a name is cat and that's how he remains because he never asked the Lord how many know that the the parents of Jesus in flesh know his name is Jesus and because the angel came and told him and you call him but now you look up names the ones that will dress this way name sounds good and you don't know that that name I mean dog or cat or something and then you wonder why my son is because he has and the nature of a dog because of his name because we are what our names are called for foreign and wait try one though but the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ are you going to receive him that is the one who's gonna meet us in the air yeah if we don't dwell in your heart comes for his own he could put little christs the inspire [Music] a sermon Italian Philippines Philippians 1 7. I have enough for the rest of the year here this is the one that has a block of cheese you save it through the years it's so good I just want it all to myself one seven come on even as it is meat for me to think this is speaking of the messenger Paul no one will enter Heaven with this message if you don't enter through the message to Paul there's no entrepreneurs you don't enter with the message of William Brennan well through the message of Paul because if those that Paul went in mind word by word of what Paul said Glory because I have you in my heart in as much as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel all are partakers of my grace so who are we partakers from William with William Brennan or with Paul body of the Lord Jesus Christ William Branham told us if those of Paul went in and foreign generation William Brothers amen so we have to enter to the word grace foreign language or Latino the Latin Gracia Gracia que significa benevolencia grazia que significa benevolence it means uh honoring benevolence favor or beneficial or benefit s we as Latin Americans or Latins we didn't have a physical Prophet um we had tape Libre and we had books when he fell in our hands his word he made us accepted and today by Grace we come here to believe what do you have believed it means benevolence all benefits for benefits the film beneficiaries and you made the effort to go to South America among them my prince one of the first ones there was a rumor in Venezuela there was a message there was a prophet but they never presented them they will speak more of a brother so we never knew who was the prophet I went to a meeting I said well the prophet says this this and that and they said well brother brothers he made a mistake my thought was if I was going to be following somebody that made a mistake so where do I start Ed I said well you follow the brothers then I'll follow William Branham and we split I say yeah and we never saw each other again we'll see each other in the white Throne because I don't know if I'll ever see you again no Grace how much is it going to be a need is the gift of God grace is the gift of God they will Elevate you to the supernatural because the mirror will inflate you make you look like the handsome and then that song that says a beautiful girl how I love it I said wait 30 years and look again and then she'll skirt herself and say well that wasn't me and partaker of his life because of his Amazing Grace of how to work with his people that's why a religious person and they see us as weird people you said well God is a man no the Bible says God is a man across your effect God was as a man in every sense of the word foreign as he describes himself here there was nothing that would stop him Saint John 14 16. I like to go slow for two reasons the doctor said if you go fast move then you know if you don't walk then you're not moving 14. so you had a time time I haven't preached so you're kind of forgetting
