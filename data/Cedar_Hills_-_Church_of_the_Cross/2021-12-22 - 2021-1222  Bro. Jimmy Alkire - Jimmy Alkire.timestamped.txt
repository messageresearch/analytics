[26:50] almost
[26:56] though thou be little among the

[29:08] [Music]
[29:11] amen i mean
[29:13] we're going to start off so simple
[29:15] tonight
[29:17] because things have a way of getting
[29:19] deep for me
[29:22] [Music]
[29:38] amen
[29:40] and we're gonna talk about a little word
[29:43] that we
[29:44] probably use a lot
[29:51] okay and the paragraph that i have here
[29:57] is there
[30:00] it's actually paragraph
[30:02] 25b i don't know if we're on the that's
[30:05] not
[30:06] paragraph but that's okay yeah
[30:08] the paragraph was to start guys with
[30:11] you say i belong to the church
[30:14] let me go ahead and just read what i
[30:16] have on my notes here
[30:20] amen you say i belong to church
[30:25] jesus said except the man be born again
[30:28] he will
[30:29] in no wise enter in this video
[30:35] [Music]
[31:03] it was so tremendous this statement that
[31:05] he made here
[31:09] and he's quoting matthew 22 verse 14.
[31:14] and it's exactly what it says here
[31:28] he says but don't be miserable
[31:34] be
[31:35] chosen
[31:38] be a chosen yeah
[31:42] how can you be your chosen
[31:53] but now we're going to see the
[31:54] definition of the word
[31:56] be our musa
[32:08] amen
[32:10] i'll wait for you if not i'll go ahead
[32:12] and take off here okay
[32:15] very well i'll go to the definition here
[32:18] the word be from the webster dictionary
[32:22] the dictionary
[32:23] to have there we go now we've got it
[32:26] we've got it to have an objective
[32:29] existence significant
[32:32] existence
[32:34] my you there's an objective
[32:38] for your existence there's a reason
[33:07] who caused you to be here tonight
[33:12] what caused you to be here tonight
[33:16] oh my goodness
[33:22] or occupy a place
[33:25] situation situation or position
[33:30] now we will start to see what it is to
[33:32] be
[33:33] a christian
[33:36] significant
[33:48] undisturbed
[34:04] wow
[34:06] how many
[34:08] say that your existence
[34:10] what do you think is for existence
[34:12] to be
[34:13] the chosen one
[34:16] it seems like this quote says that if
[34:18] you're born again then you can be chosen
[34:24] and we look at this little place of
[34:26] bethlehem
[34:30] smallest of any little domain in all of
[34:33] judah
[34:37] and even when joshua under the
[34:39] inspiration of the holy spirit
[34:43] was dividing out
[34:45] the land to each of the 12 tribes
[34:51] when he divided out what judah was
[34:54] supposed to have
[35:00] it didn't even mention this little town
[35:04] this little place called bethlehem
[35:09] it wasn't even in the inheritance
[35:13] well joshua divided out to judah what he
[35:16] was going to have when he crossed over
[35:22] and sometimes we feel that way
[35:27] and brother branham says why
[35:29] and then we wonder why god would pick on
[35:32] that little bitty
[35:34] town of bethlehem
[35:57] against the little town of bethlehem it
[35:58] seemed like god had something against it
[36:02] if you would study the history of what
[36:04] happened just to
[36:06] for this little town to come about
[36:38] puello have you ever felt like
[36:43] why is it that i get picked on all the
[36:45] time
[36:59] [Music]
[37:47] let anything bother you
[38:03] it's so something so simple
[38:07] so what the prophet said this these
[38:09] questions came to me
[38:15] is he
[38:27] isn't that the question that many of us
[38:29] have in our mind this is
[38:45] oh
[38:48] have you ever thought that way
[38:50] nobody has ever thought that way
[38:53] people thought well yeah maybe i'm
[38:55] called but i'm not chosen oh
[39:12] you are chosen
[39:27] why
[39:28] if you're born again
[39:30] born again
[39:34] the word of the age
[39:37] man how many are born of this word of
[39:39] the age quantus
[39:45] [Music]
[39:52] and the ages that that process came
[39:55] through
[39:58] brings you to a full birth
[40:03] amen i like the way he said it in
[40:05] spanish
[40:07] because there's another quote where he
[40:09] says it's the complete birth
[40:14] but brother jimmy if we're born in
[40:16] bethlehem
[40:19] how many have read this message
[40:22] how many young people have read this
[40:24] message
[40:28] one in 1958
[40:32] and the other in 1963
[40:36] and he says beth let him
[40:38] belin
[40:40] what does the word beth mean
[40:44] house
[40:50] or
[41:24] that's why he had to be born in
[41:25] bethlehem
[41:28] this little insignificant place is
[41:32] significant
[41:59] [Music]
[42:10] and the prophet says it was just like
[42:11] maybe one or two little houses
[42:18] maybe he went there to start a little
[42:19] business to start another society
[42:21] another community
[42:25] but he started he founded this little
[42:28] place
[42:30] out of all the 150 cities or more in
[42:34] palestine
[42:39] palestine
[42:40] did you say 150 100 yes
[42:43] this little place was the smallest of
[42:45] all of them
[42:49] what made it so incredible
[42:53] it was the most fertile place in all of
[42:55] palestine
[43:11] great orchards of olives
[43:14] oh it was the place of bread that you
[43:17] could get bread there
[43:22] out of all of palestine this little
[43:24] bitty insignificant place
[43:29] insignificant
[43:31] this is where the house of god's bread
[43:33] was naturally speaking
[43:38] and other peoples came from other parts
[43:40] yotras personal dignity lugares to buy
[43:43] their wheat for a comparison
[43:45] to buy their olives
[43:47] [Music]
[43:48] it was such a further place
[43:52] but yet so insignificant
[43:54] insignificant and you say brother jimmy
[43:56] what does that have to do with being
[43:58] born in bethlehem
[44:05] being born again
[44:14] oh if you can be born again you can be
[44:16] chosen
[44:20] for
[44:49] you can't put a price on it
[44:52] there's no
[44:53] quantity of money that you could ever
[44:56] pay for
[45:00] this little place bethlehem
[45:15] i'm so brand new in the message
[45:22] but if the rapture comes and i i don't
[45:25] seem to go with you all
[45:29] well i'll see you at the great white
[45:30] throne
[45:34] nobody's ever stopped like that huh just
[45:36] crazy business
[45:37] crazy brothers jimmy
[45:43] questions and answers i'm not going to
[45:44] go to the quote brothers that's why i
[45:45] didn't give it to you i'm just going to
[45:46] read it if you want to mark it down
[45:50] 19 59 questions
[45:55] will a babe in christ go in the rapture
[45:58] um
[46:24] my brother
[46:26] no
[46:26] he said no okay no anybody else will
[46:29] have david christ go in the rapture
[46:35] yes also we have yes and no
[46:38] no
[46:40] i would think before i i read this i i
[46:43] thought no
[46:45] whoever said no
[46:46] neither one of us are right but
[46:48] but at least we're honestly we give an
[46:50] answer right
[46:52] [Music]
[47:08] no
[47:22] but a person in the denominational world
[47:24] gets a hold of the act
[47:29] of what the new birth is
[47:33] just to accept jesus as your savior
[48:03] born in bethlehem
[48:06] amen i mean
[48:08] believe that
[48:10] everybody understand let me see how many
[48:11] understand it
[48:16] if you're born again
[48:25] can you imagine a little place like this
[48:28] little
[48:29] church that we have here
[48:46] saying that i learned when i was growing
[48:48] up
[49:00] not
[49:02] but you don't know it's what's inside
[49:05] that this little place it's the wheat of
[49:09] the world

[50:38] when a church is groaning under the
[50:40] persecution of the outside world

[50:49] that the promise of the holy ghost is
[50:51] just as real to us as it was
[51:06] permanente
[51:18] how they groan and cry under labor pains
[51:24] and when they are born
[51:28] here's our subtitle
[51:31] and positionally born into the kingdom
[51:33] impositional
[51:40] [Music]
[51:48] ghost is said in the church
[51:51] do you believe that god has set these
[51:54] ministries in the church
[51:59] how many believe that raise your hand
[52:02] you know
[52:09] amen and we talk about the word
[52:11] perfection it doesn't mean you don't
[52:13] break a plate
[52:17] though it means that you come to a
[52:20] maturity significa
[52:23] it means that perfection to god
[52:25] significa
[52:27] is not what perfection is to a human
[52:30] being
[52:45] my brothers and sisters
[52:48] that have been baptized by the holy
[52:50] ghost
[52:52] to the body of christ

[54:21] and they come back with a big thing of
[54:24] groups that grapes that was dragging the
[54:26] ground

[57:05] their own
[57:08] in the in john 1 1.
[57:23] oh what a disgrace oh jesus
