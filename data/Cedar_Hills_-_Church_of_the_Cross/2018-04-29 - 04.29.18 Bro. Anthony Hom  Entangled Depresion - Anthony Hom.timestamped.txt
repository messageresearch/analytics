[33:15] lo noise algo muy profundo we don't want
[33:17] to keep you very long either
[33:18] look at the most and that was mucho but
[33:20] it's something that that's very
[33:21] important result Oh muy importante and
[33:23] we we hope that you that we can that we
[33:26] can do it justice this morning is but
[33:28] almost sir who Stowe's esta mañana if we
[33:30] turn our Bibles to the book of John she
[33:33] was a la vela liberal isn't one chapter
[33:35] 17 verse 15 capitalist yet they were
[33:38] still King say this is Jesus party is
[33:40] his sous of London he's talking to the
[33:42] Father
[33:42] Orlando Leal partly and it's one of the
[33:45] most tremendous
[33:45] passages that you'll ever read yes uno
[33:48] los mensajes master Mendoza Cousteau
[33:49] puede layer when he's praying and the
[33:52] prayer is Lord made it let them be one
[33:54] as you and I are one cuando Laura Casey
[33:56] or que hace una como como tu y yo somos
[33:58] uno but this is a
[34:00] a piece of context here is the zoom
[34:02] context or in his prayer he says yes
[34:05] what assume I pray not that thou should
[34:07] has take them out of the world
[34:09] noruego kilo skeeters del mundo but that
[34:11] thou should has keep them from evil sino
[34:14] que los Cuates del man what a what a
[34:16] thing kegger and course he didn't ask to
[34:18] take us from this world
[34:19] no PD O'Keefe was a mosquito but he
[34:21] asked in this prayer to keep us from
[34:23] evil but also what uh knows that man
[34:25] me the Lord had the blessings to the
[34:27] reading of his word and he may be seated
[34:29] Vennela and this you know little clues
[34:30] to pull out of points in time so today
[34:32] we can just relax a little bit support a
[34:34] lahar some poco but not too much no
[34:37] mucho we have kind of two two little
[34:40] sermonettes that were that are related
[34:42] then the most common it is chrysalis you
[34:44] probably saw kind of a strange title up
[34:46] there proto-tool algo extraño G it's
[34:49] called the entangled depression but the
[34:51] precision in Ranade might seem kind of
[34:53] strange but I shall go extraño but this
[34:57] is what the Lord is put on my heart is
[34:58] because you know push Tameka so so but
[35:00] it's it's kind of too too little
[35:02] sermonettes I just want you two to know
[35:03] that so when we get ready to switch
[35:05] gears you you'll understand where we're
[35:08] at those sermons is going to come be a
[35:10] Muslim so he had on the stomach so it to
[35:12] get going we also want to read a quote
[35:14] from our prophet but initially the most
[35:16] lunacy today Nostra Profeta
[35:18] it's in the message the ever-present
[35:20] water from the rock ah hey el agua que
[35:23] estas en preposition present de la Roca
[35:25] we know that Israel has always been a
[35:27] historical example of the church survey
[35:30] most kids my LCM proceeded o una
[35:32] historia y Glacia because Israel was the
[35:35] people of God because rather than where
[35:38] were the Jews until they came out of
[35:40] Egypt hasta que salió de he and then
[35:42] they were the Church of God we're not
[35:44] like Lissa that he goes because they

[56:05] liquid Waseda Cordia I know that many of
[56:08] you feel that way
[56:09] you said que muchos you said she's just
[56:10] still tired cancer overwhelmed so many
[56:13] girls I know we all feel that way
[56:17] you know céntimos hace couple of months
[56:19] ago as soon as mrs. I was thinking about
[56:21] this stop in San Luis - its struggle
[56:24] that I find myself in love Italian like
[56:26] giving Quinn true and the word came to
[56:28] me la palabra vino means single word and
[56:31] we're gonna shift gears now just so you
[56:32] know you almost come here spartacus they
[56:35] say pass the word that came to me was
[56:36] depression la palabra cave you know me
[56:38] with the presume that's a that's a hard
[56:42] word to talk about it's not palau de
[56:43] dooda parabola it's a word or condition
[56:47] as una palabra de una conditions hard to
[56:50] talk about the deficit of large very
[56:52] complicated as muy complicado because
[56:55] when you're tangled it's complicated
[56:58] putting on assistant ray always is
[56:59] difficile complete sometimes maybe it's
[57:01] a little shameful the proto is algo work
[57:03] on social shameful the talk about the
[57:06] shameful to say that i'm overwhelmed the
[57:09] circus toys that would all shameful the
[57:10] say maybe I've had a little bit of
[57:12] depression but so as you get to worry
[57:14] I'll go to the person
[57:15] my understanding is a 15 million
[57:17] Americans suffer from depression
[57:19] Tania's cake in seven days americano
[57:21] souffle deposition that sounds like a
[57:22] lot but I see
[57:24] como mucho but what I find interesting
[57:25] you look in Quinto in tourism is that
[57:27] they say 80% que o Jinta por ciento are
[57:31] not treated no son trehalose
[57:35] so if 15 million suffer seeking Simeon
[57:39] is superin eighty percent aren't treated
[57:42] or cinta por ciento estan Lester how did
[57:43] they come up with 15 million to begin
[57:45] with como and sausage egg on alumina
[57:47] like in semi honest para pasar I believe
[57:50] that depression touches us off locate
[57:52] the person knows took a todos believe
[57:54] it's something that we all have to deal
[57:55] with is alcohol of this animal Scalia I
[57:58] also believe this I'm being crystal I
[58:00] also believe that depression our lives
[58:04] okay love the person has with us it
[58:07] serves a purpose
[58:08] serum for positing our founding pastor
[58:10] preached years ago I saw Sonya spree con
[58:12] esto pasó timorous evil is meant by God
[58:14] for good killed per mole ratio
[58:18] por Dios
[58:18] I believe that all of us could okay Toto
[58:21] so the whole from the older this little
[58:23] my or to the young people I still mean
[58:25] or we all suffer from some form so free
[58:27] module one people now I do know that
[58:30] clinical depression it's an affliction
[58:32] you say kala the presumed clinic is when
[58:34] affliction but some depression in our
[58:37] life serves a purpose pero algunos a
[58:39] present mr. v - um procedure I'm gonna
[58:41] share a little something with you that
[58:42] help me to understand this your
[58:44] particular States algo que me ayuda and
[58:46] there is maybe it maybe this sounds a
[58:48] little bit strange the proof does when a
[58:49] algo extraño maybe you say brother that
[58:51] doesn't apply to stop liquor but for
[58:54] those of you that can come along with me
[58:56] for just a minute what's come up well
[58:57] the producer here to put a solo me know
[58:58] if this helped me to understand
[59:00] estimated ami aunt and then how many
[59:03] know that our water comes from the
[59:05] ground
[59:06] what does I mean que nuestra agua
[59:07] preceded de la tierra we live in the
[59:09] desert right you be most analysts here a
[59:11] lot of lakes and stunning it has Lagos
[59:13] it goes as a see our water that we drink
[59:14] comes from the network fmos viene de la
[59:17] tierra do you know that it takes a well
[59:19] to bring that water up you said a kid in
[59:22] an audio on postal para sacar el agua
[59:24] it's a it's a well you have to put it
[59:26] from a it's a Carlile okay you know and
[59:28] I and I heard this I was talking to a
[59:30] man at work that knows about water knows
[59:32] about Wells yeah I know but it's Rocky
[59:34] case especially that and he used the
[59:36] term and it caught my attention equals o
[59:39] L terminal Tommy attencion so the water
[59:41] that we take comes from the ground
[59:43] okay I work at tomamos bien le Lafayette
[59:45] takes a well to bring the water up you
[59:47] start a kid on an audio para sacar
[59:48] so realistically we have to defy the
[59:51] laws of gravity today most Kevin Stadler
[59:53] ladies they grab it out you to get the
[59:55] water from the ground but a sacar el
[59:57] agua there's the Lowepro fundo into into
[1:00:00] our glass but up and mr. oh and mr.
[1:00:03] Bassel a lot of gravity likely to be
[1:00:05] defiant they get over that in a cave
[1:00:07] instead of six you have to pull it up
[1:00:08] okay I kiss a Carla so it seems that
[1:00:11] were defined a law of gravity yet those
[1:00:13] puristic vincent was la ley they grab
[1:00:14] that they would be permanent I know this
[1:00:16] might be seeming like how its made or
[1:00:19] the Discovery Channel or somebody's you

[1:02:55] known as a Kenosha has the cone of
[1:02:57] depression welco know that they presume
[1:02:59] that is necessary it's necessary that
[1:03:02] little dip that forms around the straw
[1:03:04] case ending soon because they form a
[1:03:05] little bit you could have one of the
[1:03:07] best pump in the world step with an air
[1:03:09] pump but if there was no cone of
[1:03:11] depression there but as you know you
[1:03:12] know that if you would not get water for

[1:03:20] what it does su casa
[1:03:22] is it begins to push down on the water
[1:03:24] is complicit who have silvery locks and
[1:03:26] as the water is pushed down yet does
[1:03:28] impossi along the straw it forces the
