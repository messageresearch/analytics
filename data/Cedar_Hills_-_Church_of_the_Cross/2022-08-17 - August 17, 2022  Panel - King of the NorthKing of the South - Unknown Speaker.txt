tonight but it's what your word says we place ourselves in your hands Manos or just let the miraculous happen amongst your people tonight Lord in your name we asked amen amen you may be seated amen we have quite a topic tonight [Music] our founding pastor and our pastors always taught us how powerful the word is and we don't take a light anyway and the topic that we have tonight is the King of the North and the King of the South noches and we we've had plenty of time to get ready for this one and I first want to thank the ministry tonight because each group was constantly throwing some nuggets at us and I remember I I called unclean because he's the one who came up with this question is and so I thought I was gonna get the inside of it and he said I asked that question because I didn't know the answer is so when we approached this tonight you know the prophet God tells us who the king of the north is you know but when it comes to the King of the South he doesn't mention a whole lot of things but with the confidence that the Lord has given us I believe he's going to answer that for us hey man we're gonna I'm gonna read a scripture in the Book of Psalms chapter 83 to start this off address and let's start off with verse 3 to verse 5 Verso Tres a Cinco and they have taken crafty Council against like people and consulted against thy hidden onesultado is protegios they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance Israel for they have consulted together with one consent they are Confederate against thee said and I want you to remember I hope hope y'all remember when when our brother Tommy Jr had started talking about the Confederate is Confederation you know so all the panels that have leaded up to this this this is kind of taking us to not the last panel but to one of the the finalities of of what we've been studying on it you know and then the pic the picture that gets painted for us you start seeing that Nations they may not agree with each other but through time you see how they have joined together always fight against Israel Israel and so when we go through this don't forget about that part you know because because brother Branham he tells us he warns us he said when the vision had came to him he says look at Russia look at Russia Mira Russia it didn't say fear Russia but I said look at Russia look at the picture that's been painted before our eyes and I think president it's so such a beautiful picture because of the scripture that is our base is going to be Daniel chapter 11. is Daniel capitolonse but it paints a picture for us and in many cases it's so plain to us muchas versus let me read this I kind of want to start off with this and then I'll hand it over to brother Jimmy um our pastor just came back from uh some great successful meetings in Colombia juntas exitos in Colombia and as he was as he was telling us about it I I had this you know the back of my notes and I said I gotta read this because this is basically where we're leading and where God has brought us to today in the message the angel of God God always causes trouble problems mostly always to bring the people together he said did you know that I believe there's a time when there won't be any more divisions amongst the people of God such as I belong to this church and I belong to that church is I believe the persecution will run all the way big Ransom Church all together will be one Church in Jesus Christ the Church of God together and will be one in Jesus Christ then he will take her home and we won't have to argue about this Doctrine or that Doctrine yes and I believe we're at that point where it's we're at that time it's time you know uh when we start to speak on the King of the North and the 11th chapter of Daniel Capital we must understand the Canon of the scripture or the totality of what chapter 11 entails there's a more concentrated form of Prophecy in the 11th chapter of the Book of Daniel and it brings in a period of time of over 2300 years and uh that's why there's no way we'll be able to do it justice we're not going to try to explain it all even though we can't to begin with but there's a reason why as you know we we look at this and we study this and we dig into it uh the theologians and the historians the hardly any of them believed that Russia is the King of the North little historianos and on the King of the South they'll say the King of the South is Egypt and they've got all these opinions but that's because they couldn't receive a little Prophet that came to interpret the symbols of the Bible and they don't realize the compoundness or how the scripture is compounded now why is the scripture compound as as I'm studying this I see what we're dealing with a period of time of over 2300 years and there's certain parts of this this prophecy that's in the 11th chapter that historically has already come to pass and that's all they can see yes they can not see an application of the components of how it means something today uh and why is the scripture calm down because as the prophet would say people will come and go la Gente vendra Generations will live and die hundreds of years ago but those Spirits never die and when the spirits have a course they say is to come to their finality or to come to the complete fulfillment of the scripture and that's what the people cannot see without a prophet is so I would like to start with the scripture that brother Branham referred to me even though it's at the very end of the chapter but let's go to Daniel 11 . let me get it real quick Daniel 11 he's going to have it up there I'll just read it off I want you to notice it up until this point in in all the way to verse 39 hasta is talking about many periods of times he's talking about Kings and princes but all of a sudden in verse 40 he says at the time of the end shall the King of the South push against him that's against the King of the North and the King of the North shall come against him like the Whirlwind if you put that in modern terms we could say with military vehicles and tanks military with Horsemen yeah and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over verse 41 verse you know and he shall also enter into the Glorious land and many countries shall be overthrown but these shall Escape out of his hand even Edom Moab and the sheep of the children of Amen my sisters but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver over all the precious things of Egypt is the Libyan Libya libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his death verse now watch this here but Tidings out of the East and out of the North shall trouble him foreign therefore he shall go forth with great Theory to destroy and utterly to make away many is muchos and he shall plant the Tabernacles of his powers between the Seas and the glorious holy mountains Glorioso yet he shall come to his end and None Shall help him you know and and the peoples of the world read the description and go wow what's his end is the beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation starting with paragraph 100 now Daniel has given this assurance and at the end of the Gentile dispensation when you go home tomorrow read 11 the 11th chapter and you can see how the King of the North is coming down which is nothing else but Russia coming down to press against it between and the great battle of Armageddon will be fought right they're near the Gates of Jerusalem is and when you go home read paragraphs 101 to about 112 and he's talking about Daniel 12. paragraph here because I don't want to get to reading too much Michael the great Prince shall stand up for what Miguel principles foreign I'll be overlap one with the others it's not that one event's finished and then another one starts as one is ending the other one's already starting and it shows you the picture or I like the way it says it in Spanish the scene so we'll we'll stop right there on that and say uh now since we're starting with the the end part where the King of the North comes and then it goes all the way to Armageddon how many want to be here when the King of the North goes all the way in the war of Armageddon takes place no we don't want to be here and now another question might arise here why doesn't brother talk practically he mentions the King of the South in a few places but he never goes into what it is but what he's going into is exactly what the scripture indicated in reverse the 40. the message at the end time and that's why God showed him what retained remain to this age so impresso is based on this brother Ben what is The Six Day War that happened in Israel in 1966 okay what does it have to do with the King of the North because when we look at the I know I talked about this a little bit conflict you know the answer is okay so when we talk about how Russia or the King of the North which is Russia starts to come down because I know we've talked about this I know we've talked about with Uncle on also um as far as when the bride's taken away when do you how do you see this happening will the bride still be here when the King of the North starts heading down versus you know and I I know [Music] but that's why I I stated right now how the prophecies and the ages of overlap foreign and he's gone into Ukraine yeah but in the combination or the complete manifestation of that [Music] prophecya he says this happens and he says it right here in this quote in these times is when this is going to take place is when the resurrection is going to come but right now the Gentile dispensation is very rapidly fading out but I can say it that way but when it gets down to the nitty-gritty and he starts going through wiping out these other nations if we were to read the scripture here in Daniel 11 it even states that Egypt will not Escape no Egypt will not escape and Egypt is directly south of Israel he Israel it's going to be destroyed then Israel which is right next to it why isn't it destroyed well that's about the time Revelation 19 happens I wanted you to get into that part with Egypt so you you know when we look at before we start entering into the six day word so you you see the you kind of wanted the picture painted with brother Jimmy on that last part because to me when you look at the Six Day War it was to me it seemed like the first time that Russia wanted to do what the scripture states that he will do that's where you hear how a lot of a lot of these would talk about how that bullets would even turn a Corner Las Vegas that they didn't know why they didn't get killed and how they survived this Ware what was what was so powerful when I started getting into this is who was behind the wall and it was Russia you say how did Russia if Russia never step foot there is why couldn't they do nothing because the Angels were holding them back for the gym Los Angeles what happened to their airplane so so one of the one of the things Russia did not want to get involved in this war Russia you know they say that towards the end of this war yeah Russia was going to get involved yeah but by some reason they couldn't get their planes off the ground no uh so by the time they got the rack together I believe it was God that stopped that Ware but the way the war started is Russia sent a fake signal to Egypt Russia and what that fake signal was was that Israel was about to attack the Egypt is [Music] all those Arab countries go and start to attack Israel spices but months before this happened somehow began to arm Egypt so what was what was happening Russia knew all along what they were going to do Russia but they began to build Egypt up so that's why you see how why the scripture that brother Jim had white in chapter 11 why it says it that way is how that not even Egypt was going to escape because we could go back to the chapter 11 and you're gonna see and I believe our brother Abram's gonna touch on it in a little bit how through flatteries foreign they began to get to be able to work one month to another to work against Israel so as we've heard in the last pounds why is everybody wanting to go against Israel Israel we're talking about the Arab countries it's because they're the children of who is Ishmael right the Ismael you know and then you we could go into even details and there's some of the children of Esau there and that's why they hate Israel so that's why it here comes Russia with flatteries I I even Ivan Russia on um to get them to work with Russia or the King of the North to go against them but but when you start look when you start seeing the whole picture Russia is sitting back there and starts working to go against Israel but as we know what ended up happening is they couldn't god with his Mercy stopped it and he didn't let it go past itself amen how many understood that so the historians see this is Russia's already fulfilled that part it is and as we read in the very last verse of chapter 11 verses what troubled the King of the North was movement in the north and in the East and then if we had a map up of of the way the Middle East and Europe looks right now and Europe Europa Europa at the very top of Russia Russia there's nothing further north than Russia but they don't understand the historians don't understand that at the beginning of the Russian Empire El principles it was called the Russian Empire and I'm not pronouncing that word right he says and they they even had Kings or Empress called Alexander their first Alexander II and third and so forth the Reyes Alejandro is these things are important but when we see the full manifestation or all those spirits that have gone through all those generations of people manifestations from and maybe someday we can get into Daniel too but we would not have time to get into that tonight we've got 30 minutes left but here's where I would like to go with this I would like to go to another quote yeah in the entire Charming Church age I believe you guys got it up there and it's paragraphs 136 and 137. thank you guys foreign and I'll give you a little thing on that is have you ever or have I ever quote it to you that in the last conference they had up there for a cruise ship took off his shoe and beat the table with him there were five eastern Nations gathered there again since where did the pressure come from the East Del oriente all right watch this and then there were five Western Nations Gustav headed the Eastern nation is Eisenhower headed the Western Nation Eisenhower in Cabeza Las naciones occidentalis there's the two main leaders yes principales the two big toes and Russia means clay the seed Eisenhower Eisenhower in America in English means iron in English Okay based on this and there's a lot of things we could go into right there but brother Ben here's a question for you I want you to hit on this what's significance significance does it have this conference here with Eisenhower this was Eisenhower what significance did the son of Khrushchev play significance well we first got to start off with you know the Weber the debate in the kitchen you know that is is actually um wasn't Eisenhower but it was um Nixon Nixon was the Vice President Nixon they had this discussion and if you if you when you started getting into Cruise shipment you um he was a very cas charismatic Persona bien charismatica so you know he took over from where Stalin left off Stalin and just like brother Jim was talking about spirits earlier you know those that same Spirit of a mighty conqueror in the north is it went from one roller to another ruler and Stalin was before him and talking about conquer to their people you know they didn't care if they had to kill their own people they were major dictators so so you have here very charismatic Persona bien charismatic he's talking with Nixon Nixon and he's pushing Nixon Nixon he begins to challenge Nicki and which we know was the race to the moon but he kept on pushing that Nixon pushing that Nixon which caused this this race this competition well because Russia and the United States which when we go you go to the scripture and you start seeing it more clearly yes and from that dictator yes what really caught my attention the USSR broke up in 1991. and it was it was so many people wanted to know what the answers were many went to the files foreign either repente his son moved to the United States and becomes a U.S citizen of the Americano in 1991. and they began to sit down with him and try to pick his brain on his father information that that's incredible this is incredible there's another place I don't know if brother Branham said or I read it in news many many years ago the politicians were in a meeting one of the Russian Representatives rose up and said you know we will defeat you without ever firing one gun it is we won't have to go to a literal world yes we will beat you from the inside if that's not exactly what happened you see no excitement because what we see today and and the world order and then which includes religion and politics you can see now that this nation has been eaten out by communism foreign political party which I don't want to get in no communism is our nation because why because when God sends a prophet it's warning before judgment he sends that Prophet when there's time to turn back in real Professor but when they turn that down now the judgments begin to line up hermano Jimmy let me read this quote brother Jim on this one so very you know we look and everything that the prophet has given us when you see he spoke so many things that was meant for our day when brother Jim was saying that this code that I have just like literally popped out in baptism of the Holy Spirit 1958 that's the reason Russia is playing exactly into the hand of God [Music] to rock this thing out of here the Bible says God is using communism he will use communism is communism that will destroy the whole thing is according to the scriptures and we are at that time now with this I'm I'm going to ask brother Abraham to comment on Daniel 11 verse where brother Bennett makes a strange statement after saying everything we just said look at the the Simmons he says that communism and Catholicism will unite is and you go after all this how how is that you said the event so it is once we get to go a chance to go through the order of Daniel 11. which We're not gonna have time for tonight we'll see that in the verse verses three through six of Daniel 11 says it started talking about the rise of another king in pieces and how his kingdom it wouldn't be as the way he had it before but it would continue but not of his own posterity uh foreign and when you study history you find out that that is Alexander the Great you're not going to go into that this is Alejandro Grande and it goes from there and it goes through each one of those things that Daniel saw on the vision right the head of gold yeah silver brass and then it all ended up in the wrong brother and roma brother Abraham now you hit that um what you've got on Daniel 11 well they said that uh that brother Brenham didn't talk too much about or talk about the King of the South but he really talked a lot about the queen of the South could the King of the South be from the same place just think about it they say that Spirits don't die and we see that Putin he's the one that's gonna attack the King of the South and the spirit that anoints him Was the Same Spirit that anointed Adolf Hitler element because when Hitler started World War II in 1939. I hate to say but that's when I was born you know what Jackie it's good to see you amen I can still say like your empty route he says I can still sing in the choir so amen so anyway when Hitler attacked they call it the blitz Creek it means that he went from country to Country conquering country significance and you're gonna see here in the King of the North he's gonna start doing the same thing he's coming down and we're gonna start conquering all a lot of those countries that are in the South let me read here and I'm going to start with 11 27. and both these king's heart shall be to do Mischief amen that's the King of the North and the King of the South yeah and they shall speak lies to add one table um he was a prophet a prophesied it it will happen shall be at the time appointed yes it has already been appointed foreign [Music] but yet the end shall be at that time appointed then shall he returned to his land with great riches and his heart shall be against the Holy Covenant there is no way we can speak in the holy cows and he shall do exploit and return to his own land here we go again and at the time appointed he shall return or laprio Como La Primera what verse 30. or the chips shall come against him therefore he shall be grieved and returned and have indignation against the Holy Covenant so shall he do he shall even return and have intelligence with them that forsake the Holy Covenant Santo the ships they think who is it is Cyprus it is the young guys what does the word Mediterranean means young ladies what does the word Mediterranean mean the word self tells you what it means there is a guess tell him Hector Hector right it's it's the middle of the Earth yes but the ships because Cyprus is a country on an island of the Mediterranean it's Cyprus and is between turkey and Syria as as entered turkey and Cyprus is a member of the British Commonwealth Essie so here comes the King of the North and probably there was a blockade with all the British Commonwealth has 52 States he saw all this probably all these countries of places and he says he got upset and with indignation verse 31 verses stand on his part and they shall pull with the sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice and they shall place the Abomination that makes their solid he said proof profan Naran El santuario is what is the Abomination that makes desolations well many of you will just say it's a mask but how long is and like uh Jimmy was saying is this is compound is because brother Venom said the Temple worship will be restored at the end times so I asked the question how are they gonna rebuild the Temple is a mosque of Walmart they cannot do it without mask of um so how are they gonna remove it it's where you and have to understand that you have to read between the lines to understand the message of yahwehies because it has to be rebuilt forget and another thing how even when they remove the mask of Walmart how are they going to build another Temple if they don't have a red heifers you need a red heifer and the red heifer has to be three years old so you tell me how come all this time is do you know when they destroyed the ashes because were made the red heifer was in their ashes were made in the times of Moses foreign become consumed they would kill another Helper and mix the ashes from the times of Moses with the other heifers until they sacrifice all this time nine hairs so who are they gonna get it nothing dozen Elijah has the power to bring fire from heaven so I think that's the way they're gonna get rid of that the temple is because they need to get rid of it because remember after the Rapture porque required then the comes the great tribulations and you're gonna see the great exploits done by Moses and Elijah foreign notice the Abomination that makes desolation is yes question this evening if that was the Abomination that makes desolation remember it's compound if I ask the question which is the abomination of desolation that is going to be at the end times well that's why you come to church to learn English man notice hit it Daniel in the 70 weeks of Daniel and I said Daniel what is the abominational Yes But now what the daily worship because right now it is the times of the Gentiles at times when the Gentiles have determination over Israel is and we won't go into also about the fullness because the fullness is a political Soul Plane into this the a lot of political notice the sacrifice will come back into the city nothing when the temple is revealed Prince that is to come in the middle of the week the prince that is to come is in the middle of the week entry will break his Covenant and do away with this sacrifice is overspreading of Obama Nation is abomination there is filthiness yes what is that yes he'll break the Covenant in the middle of the week it was the abomination in the time of Jesus Jesus and when Rome came over with her propaganda and it will be Rome again to make desolate Revelation 17 apocalypse is I'm going to start with verse 2. with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with a wine up for fornication foreign to the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon us Scarlet Scarlet beastful of names of blasphemy having Seven Hats and Tang horns image and the woman was already in purple and scarlet color and Deck with gold and precious stones and Pearls Heaven the cup of iniquity the golden cup in her hand full of Obama Nations and filthiness de la in mundicia De sus fornication wasn't the Abomination is because the the mosque of Omar was in the Holy place and there was gonna happen right now happening right now it's gonna be in the end times second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 1. verse 2. that you be not shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letters from us so that the day of Christ is at hand spiritual let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come up falling away first and that men of sin be revealed the son of perdition [Music] who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called God for there is worship so Lord he is God see it in the temple of God like Antiochus epiphanis in the temple here we see again right over here cities in the temple of God turning himself that he is God man the world is this means God is being made manifests just when it's getting good the time passes let alone that Antiochus is a descendant Alexandra the great generals later on they established antia it is Nicolas yeah I'm just gonna make this remarks it says that in the last days the bride will do exploits Grandes but Brothers in uh I think it's in the as well 70 weeks of Daniel semester he
