TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] that's reason his borned out in a major labs are not born in beds he he was led to the Calvary that she pearl and that's why votes lead him to the slaughter you know that in slaughterhouse a goat leads him but they have to be led that's right so he was led to the slaughter see because he wasn't lamb everything identified him in nature that's the reason he was born in March or April not the December he couldn't be twenty foot of snow up there net Khatami here not o Sun God but he was a son of God the Roman Sun God on the 25th day of December when the solar passes its places in there and they had the Roman circuses and called the Sun God's birthday and then making the Son of God no no he was the son of God his birthday was for the rest of nature exactly now notice again now as we go on we got a little time man now to the perfect after the stock has been formed and if the Tasos been farmed after the green has come on to the cob then it has to come to perfection back to a regular green again and remember the grain must be German tines the if it don't it won't live see none of that was outside of them messages will ever hunga life let's be German ties remember the same life that was in the stock is in the green it's just maturing yourself right back seat he revealed he said what son of man the grain that went into the ground get the message the Greek said to him we would see Jesus he said except the grain of corn falls into the grave haha now what do you reveal yourself next in a different farm stall can tousle and so forth and all the leaves everything you reveal itself then one same spirit but in a different form think but what's the last of that car it comes back to the original green that Wright and his ministry comes from them Reclamation's back to the original word again the word comes to a prophet and he promised to the Malachi 4 and to restore the faith of the people back to the original dream but when in the ground is here the same the green is come up through here and come up his son of God now it reveals itself very son of man and then it reveals yourself as son of David on the throne see and three son in this exactly oh my again like the original now to the perfect ministry audience self not some and not some denomination as they've worked out through that age there see but he himself made manifest manifest himself to the promised making Saint Luke 17 28 Malachi 4 and so forth Hebrews 13:8 just exactly right at that time what time should it be when the royal seat of Abraham is looking for the promised son and all types must be fulfilled and God Himself appeared in the form of a human being that Abraham's natural seed before the destruction and Jesus said it would be the same thing for this royal seat before the promised son returns notice that all Vale that hid the glory the old badger skins there was no Beauty to be desired of it neither was his flesh that's reason people said a little stooped over fella like that probably thirty years old gray beard gray wasn't much to look at the Bible said there's no beauty we should desire him he didn't look like a king the old badger skin oh what was on the inside now a little bunch of Holy Roller sitting together in a hot building like this they call them not much beauty to be desired but what's only I'm sure it's veiled from many hearts all right outwardly it was nothing but always on the inside once the inside of it then you see it how did you get into it shaking hands yawning no born into it dying get rid of your old badger skin see your old self to get into a new one thing forsake the old badger skins this Shekinah light does not listen ministers ministers I want you to listen to this when once inside I will take this real easy so he'd be sure together once inside the veil under the Shekinah glory the Shekinah light does not take the Word of God in reveal Jesus to be a fortune-teller know like the denominations do today mineral telepathy Holy Roller Beelzebub the Shekinah glory doesn't reveal in there but the Shekinah glory ripens the seed that's promised for that alpha by the word showing him to be still the lily the violet it brings forth that seed the lily the valley the bread of life the Alpha and Omega the same yesterday today and forever he is the believers potion the Shekinah glory reveals to the believer is the same yesterday today and forever not the days he's past and he died it's all over so Fran if you believe that if you believe that you've never struck the Shekinah glory how could the Shekinah glory ever reveal even three persons how could the Shekinah glory ever reveal him is being baptized people in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost when there's never a person in the Bible baptized that way how could the Shekinah glory limit him to an apostle when he's the same yesterday today and forever the Shekinah glory manifested it brings forth the word of promise right out to you that's reason that he had to veil Moses face because in him was the word he bailed Jesus as the humble little man to keep her from seeing Jehovah and he bails itself today in earthen vessels but the Shekinah outside looks like a bunch of holy rollers old badger skins but the enzyme hides the Shekinah glory it writings a shoe bread that we feast on and drive across a country for hundreds of miles it's the believers food it's only far believer remember the shewbread was only for the believer only shewbread seed notice what does it do that's Shekinah glory over the shewbread kept it from Sparling remember the manna that came from heaven it was stayed in the Shekinah glory from one generation to another outside it got wiggle tails in it overnight it contaminated is that right outside of the Shekinah glory the days of miracles is past see it's all fanaticism but inside look they got some sunflower seed out of a garner in Egypt that put in there in the days of Joseph 4000 years nearly ago Joseph putting in the garner they planted him they lived what they had life what's this Shekinah glory today to break me on the veil to see who God is standing before you see who God is standing here before us the the pillar fire he's veiled in human flesh but what does this what does it do the shewbread sees the word that were to live on in this name of these promises the Shekinah glory write-ins that shewbread brings up the past makes it brand to the believer that laid in the pages of the Bible year after year the word for this age to the denominations it's a stumbling block to the denominations they stumble headed down through the years Luther Wesley Martin Luther and all Sankey Finney John Smith knock all still elated but what's it to be there for the light stays what is to reveal bring forth what's now can't afford to do to turn back people from this stumbling block to break down the traditions and to reveal the bread with the Shekinah glory watch it ripen and produced just exactly what it said it would oh my the shoe brand for this age to the denomination of stumbling-block a bunch of fanatics but we who believe but now as revelation stands promise all the mysteries of God that's been hidden the pages down to them ears would be ripened brought forth in the age of the seventh angel's message is that right what did he say a year and six months ago right on two years now go out to Tucson the north of Tucson a great blast what would take place the seals would be open the seals that reveal these things come back just as he said what is it it shows it cannot be man it's perfectly just as straight as it can be each time what is it it's the hand of God the before us then because it's in a little group bailed in human flesh it's veiled to the outside world he's hid from the outside world he's revealing himself to babes such as well learners he should ever see ever parable in the Bible ever type of the Bible is made manifest right here before the saying God in the pillar fire that wrote the Bible both in the old and new Testament is right your manifest is showing just exactly what let's interpret it right back and to making sure that it's interpreters yo we got the interpretation then let's see it happen that's it made manifest manifest Jesus said if I do not the works of my father believe me not see it's got to be proven but now now I'm not proving like Jesus say put a rag around his head any more hits if your prophet tell us who hit you and if your other son of God turned these bread see that's the devil if you're the Son of God come off that I mean the revelation that he's supposed to do that's what it but now as revelation 10 is reveal the mysteries of God is made manifest known as the seven sealed book promise now that's your faith in Him who is the word false in revelations 10 it says a revelation is 19 whether I had wrote down here at least his ten to go to it but at 8:10 it's 19 when he comes he's going to be called the Word of God riding upon a white horse and followers of heaven will be behind you break the denomination of Vail of Education break the denominational veil of tradition break those veils is hiding from you break those veils of pride you women your your kings daughters act like it live like it break every veil no matter what PhD lld said of his contrary to that Bible break to that bill why are we cross the ribbon page we're on the other side on the other side and you will see if you'll just do that break those old traditions and things that come to him you'll see him standing the mighty conquer a word a promise for this age made manifest you'll see the mighty God unveiled cm right among Asher unveiled the mighty God I'm conquered by traditions they tried to hide him behind there they did for years but the time of the promised through near God raised up a Moses one time and he set the children free from them thing and he's still he can't be conquered heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall not he's the same yesterday there forever they said can't be done but it was done then when it was done they said it said the devil but that don't change the Word of God a bit it still remains God to the believer the mighty conquer the same yesterday today and forever by his nature by his word Hebrews 13:8 I'm closing and saying this causes 5mr 12 just seeing this I got about 10 12 more pages I'll get some others out maybe tonight notice no desist there was an action one time and the other little fiddle up you've heard it many times no valiant the auctioneer said what am I offered part I may not have this just right according to the point it's been many many years but it comes on my mind and they picked up the old fiddle it didn't look very much looks crummy everything he couldn't even get a bid on it Bonnie I think you ought to bid for a dollar or something like that and they were so understanding there that didn't think in order to sell for that so he went and picked it up it struck it in his hands picked up the bow and rosin it and he played a tune and when he did everyone started crying they never heard sits music in their life then the auctioneer said what am I offered two thousand five thousand ten thousand see what was it the master's hand revealed what was veiled in the old instruments same now the old book it's a ragged it's been left at Burt made fun of but the time has come that they've got a denominational auction world carol's of churches they're selling like nobody's business there's the denominational auction coming but remember there's something in the old book that promised that there be a predestinated ordain hand come one day and we pick it up and make the word of this book to a predestinated heart did the task gets made far reveal the promises that's in it might look like a bunch of holy rollers or something there but just takes a master's hand the word on it to reveal that word and because more than a Holy Roller has become that to every one of us has new friends it's not a bunch of fanaticism this offends over whose hand the bows they let us pray our Heavenly Father by faith today I see the master of the old book that they have swapped for traditions they swapped it for denominations they tried to trade it off now they're trading it for a world council of man of churches communist ting a theistic the auction zone Lord God step forth surely you will send us that profit lord that picks up that bow that picks up this word proves that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever many Lord will sell their lives they'll throw away their old traditions he'll break the veils they won't it Lord they'll give anything anything just give them Jesus Lord I think you've proved it to them now they come from everywhere they spend their livings they do everything to try to get to the meetings to do all they can because they found that pearl of great prizes other things are very little bless them father laying on this pulpit this morning Lord lace handkerchiefs maybe someone will have to leave today before the healing service tonight Oh eternal God look down I know you're here you're veiled and I'm sending these little veils Lord called handkerchiefs and little aprons and little booties for little babies and I'm standing as little bail tokens that your word has been preached towards this morning and as a believer I lay my hands upon them my body is signifying and I believe it and by faith each one in this building is doing the same Lord may the sick get well you can stroke the the word from here Lord like the old violinist did to the violin make it so Lord make it play the right tune only the Masters hand and we will seem standing in full view how those people must have thought that day when they wouldn't give nothing when they didn't give nothing for the old violin they didn't want it they wouldn't have in their house but when once picked up by the one who could master it then they sold everything they had to get it there was less than fighting over was too late then so would it be somehow when the trumpet of the Lord shall be sounded out times shall be no more those who've been looked at and made fun of and stood there before the open veil had seen the Word of God manifested others will scream part but as you said it'll be too late then they went into the wedding supper and they were left out where there's weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth help every person to believe this morning father breakthrough every bale of selfishness ever veil of unbelief and see the mighty conquer unveiled before the believers or lo I am with you always even to the end of the world a little while in the world won't see me no more yet ye shall see me show yourself among us Lord as you have into it ever remain that way until we are visibly before you when the amorphous has been changed and you become again son of man and son of David Brennan Lord to Jesus Christ's name while we have our heads bowed and all in prayer wonder today if there's some here that inside or out there's no way to bring an altar call up here because there's no room but I wonder sincerely you believe this to be the truth you believe that in this day that we're living in all this chaos and scientific age like one of the days of Noah and the days of Moses the days of Christ that God the great father of all of us who are born into him stands among us today this visible pillar of fire that's scientifically proven many years ago as the little boy spoke to me out there and told me how to live right here what would take place telling you about it one day down Little River before the ministry started first revival he appeared in the skies identified himself and give the Commission all these years I've hid it in my heart bailing Christ chained pillar fire interpreting the word is promised we're in the last days just the coming of the Lord and if you find yourself outside that veil which is death to stay out were you by faith this morning say by God's helping with your health part I want to break through that veil I want to get in where you're at to see the full word of God and we'll try to be a Moses don't try to be an errand don't just be who you are but be a Christian would you with your heads about raise your hands to God and say Lord God help me inside the veil god bless you god bless you that's just look that outside remember I might never see your hand it isn't it isn't worth much for me to see it anyhow it is God it only to me it just makes me see that the seed has fell somewhere and but God sees the real heart if there are any others that didn't raise their hands I want to be raised now raise your hands be remember in prayer raise your hands god bless you that's good god bless you Father we pray today that these Lord who are not yet through that veil they're standing out there like Israel they're watching they believe but they've never broke into this yet to see that great Shekinah light both spiritual and physical in so much that a mechanical eye of the camera keeps taking the picture just two weeks ago caught it again you're revealing yourself Lord the mighty God unveiled to the believer still Bayeux to the unbeliever but unveiled to the believer may they break through today Lord see is great splendor and glory may their hearts be changed before we even get back to this church tonight may they all be filled with your spirit your presence may the master pick up that faith that they've got streaking across the word may the tune come back now has been our Deen before the foundation of the world to believe this believe my child and be safe father God we commit them into your
