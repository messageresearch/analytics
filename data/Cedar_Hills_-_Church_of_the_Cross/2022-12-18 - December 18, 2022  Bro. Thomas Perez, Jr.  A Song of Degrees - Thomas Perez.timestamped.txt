[44:22] and thanks to see all of our cousins
[44:26] Primo God bless you
[44:29] amongst them is
[44:32] my my namesake my name is
[44:37] brother Thomas God bless you
[44:40] he is
[44:43] on his side there's four four tomases
[44:49] and on mice on our side there's four
[44:51] also
[44:55] I I got to meet his son
[45:02] and it's just one of those things when
[45:04] you say hello how are you is
[45:07] what's your name
[45:10] what's your name
[45:13] are you serious
[45:16] amen but we're very grateful to the Lord
[45:19] you have all of them here with us this
[45:20] morning
[45:23] and thankful to our pastor for the
[45:26] confidence this morning
[45:31] last weekend
[45:35] you that we're here on Sunday morning
[45:39] what a great time we had
[45:42] and so we're grateful that that what God
[45:45] has done for us is
[45:51] sometimes I I
[45:53] I've been a Bible student my whole life
[45:55] yesterday
[45:57] and you know there's there's people that
[46:00] don't know what to preach
[46:04] for us that that have been revealed to
[46:07] us the message of the hours
[46:11] there's not enough time in a day
[46:14] because everything is just new
[46:18] the Bible speaks to us about us to speak
[46:21] to us about new mercies
[46:25] and so every time I open the pages
[46:29] I don't know if this this happens to you
[46:33] but things just jump out at you
[46:37] I think that one day the the prophet of
[46:40] God
[46:42] must have been reading in the Book of
[46:45] Malachi
[46:47] and he came upon the scripture
[46:50] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[46:54] and he said that's me
[46:57] and you know one day you hear you read
[47:00] in the pages of the scripture
[47:03] the bride has made herself ready
[47:06] and you say it that one's talking about
[47:09] me
[47:10] and you know so I I look and open the
[47:13] Bible
[47:15] and at the very beginning in a lot of
[47:18] these Psalms have a song of degrees
[47:23] but this this got my attention
[47:27] right away uh it's Psalm 128 um song of
[47:32] degrees
[47:35] and I was looking at at uh per se our
[47:40] life
[47:43] my life and how we we aren't what we we
[47:48] uh had set out to be you know
[47:54] you know we we every day we want to be
[47:57] better
[47:59] if we don't want to be better
[48:03] there's something wrong with us
[48:05] but I I I think that a person doesn't
[48:08] doesn't strive one day and say I wish I
[48:11] was poor today than yesterday
[48:17] I'm really poor today tomorrow I hope
[48:19] I'm double poor yeah
[48:24] neither does a Christian should ever
[48:26] come out and say
[48:28] I don't have the Holy Ghost today
[48:32] I'll make sure I don't have it tomorrow
[48:35] I believe within ourselves you
[48:46] to be able to to produce what its
[48:49] intended purpose was foreign
[49:30] for this comes from the Lord who is the
[49:34] spirit foreign
[49:39] than we were yesterday
[49:43] and our answer should be a resounding
[49:46] yes
[49:49] in understanding God himself
[49:54] by the prophet of the age
[49:57] he first tells us that he was hell
[50:02] and then
[50:05] Elohim
[50:06] it was all all going into degrees
[50:12] unto the point that he would even say
[50:15] that Jehovah of the Old Testament
[50:20] Jesus of the news
[50:26] I believe that even in the ministry of
[50:29] brother Branham
[50:32] he was not not comfortable
[50:35] just being what the Lord had just given
[50:38] him at that time
[50:41] he was always searching
[50:44] and God would say I'm going to change
[50:46] your ministry
[50:49] and the angel tell told him you're going
[50:54] to have three pools
[50:56] go you go it is also a song of
[51:03] I believe that when the word of God
[51:05] comes to us
[51:08] it should be changing us from one degree
[51:11] to another
[51:13] from one glory to another Gloria from
[51:17] one face to another
[51:19] from one pool to another
[51:22] from one person to another person feel
[51:26] all they see is Christ
[51:32] we ourselves
[51:35] understand the opening of the word
[51:39] when we try to get the word of God
[51:44] isolate a scripture is
[51:51] no longer the god of degrees
[51:55] when we try to isolate ourselves
[52:02] to refuse to go into the word of God
[52:07] it is no longer a song
[52:12] but when we hear the word of God
[52:15] the word of God is the lake
[52:19] that produces the river
[52:21] that produces a picture
[52:25] that produces a Dipper
[52:29] to be able to take away the Revelation
[52:34] the word of God
[52:36] from its Pages
[52:38] we ourselves Nosotros mismos have got to
[52:42] understand that God has this great
[52:44] Treasury
[52:49] did you ever have a Time afternoon
[52:53] we were in in a in Men's Warehouse one
[52:57] day
[52:59] with the with the young men one time
[53:03] they they said uh this jacket is very
[53:07] expensive
[53:10] and I said to whom I can it's only
[53:14] expensive if you have no money
[53:17] if you're a billionaire
[53:20] a million dollar house is nothing
[53:23] um
[53:25] if you got a hundred dollars
[53:27] a penny is not much
[53:31] but the word of God goes by degrees
[53:36] sometimes we only want to come to church
[53:38] to get a chill down our streets
[53:45] but if you wanna go
[53:47] online
[53:54] degrados
[54:06] but when I see people that claim the
[54:09] message
[54:10] to live the same life that they lived
[54:14] last year
[54:16] I was living in the degrees
[54:19] they're still trying to figure out if
[54:22] they believe
[54:24] we already believe
[54:27] some people gotta pray about what they
[54:30] believe
[54:32] Joel's already come to me
[54:36] angels already come to you
[54:39] and he has produced a song of degree
[54:44] should we be better than yesterday
[54:47] well brother I believe that brother what
[54:50] brother Branham says
[54:53] yes see I believe what brother Branham
[54:56] says
[54:57] I believe that the word of God is the
[54:59] word of God
[55:01] brother branham's talking to you
[55:05] about his degrees
[55:48] his song of degrees
[55:55] but what about those that have believed
[55:58] his word
[56:02] this is the turning point of the message
[56:04] of the hours
[56:07] people look for something to happen
[56:12] and they acknowledge of what happened in
[56:15] the
[56:18] paste
[56:22] the time present tense
[56:26] so God cannot deal with them
[56:30] so many people that claim Malachi are
[56:33] foreign
[56:55] they tell you 32 below zero is really
[56:58] cold
[57:00] and all of a sudden you go outside
[57:05] you find out it's 32 below risk is but
[57:09] you're always cold before you go out
[57:11] yeah
[57:12] it's gonna be cold it's gonna be really
[57:16] cold play a song of degrees
[57:20] but you gotta climatize yourself dude
[57:24] you gotta climatize yourself
[57:28] you have to you you have to climatize
[57:31] yourself
[57:32] when you come to the house of the Lord
[57:35] and you say well it's this Sunday
[57:38] morning
[57:42] you're already trying to tell us what
[57:46] your degree is yes
[57:48] I love people that come Sunday morning
[57:52] and are not dragging to church
[57:59] and you're and they're with the attitude
[58:01] of you're lucky that I'm here
[58:05] they don't want to go in a penny higher
[58:09] but let me tell you
[58:12] when Solomon when he became
[58:17] what captured
[58:19] the queen of sheba's attention
[58:24] was the happiness of his people
[58:31] why okay silver silver was like a common
[58:36] brick on the road
[58:40] when his Chariot tears would go down the
[58:44] valley
[58:47] they would dust their hair with gold
[58:51] when they would hear Solomon speak
[58:56] it was the wisdom of God
[59:00] is this where we're all at
[59:04] I heard your wisdom
[59:07] and it was all great
[59:09] I also saw your servants
[59:13] let us go into the house of the Lord
[59:16] so I raised up my hands they went from
[59:19] your smile I glorify him you know why so
[59:24] it is a song of degrees
[59:28] that's why I tell people I'm going to
[59:31] say this again you could tell where
[59:34] people are when they do this number is
[59:41] okay
[59:44] but when when you love God
[59:47] I'll stop my boys
[59:50] when you love the Lord raise up your
[59:52] hands
[59:54] you're gonna sing man say man be a man
[59:58] if you're happy to be in the house of
[1:00:00] the Lord be happy to be in the house
[1:00:04] he rescued me
[1:00:07] he loved me when nobody loves me
[1:00:10] but no one cared for me
[1:00:14] was the song of the Greek
[1:00:19] foreign
[1:00:21] God so loved the world
[1:00:24] this is the degree is he gave his only
[1:00:28] begotten
[1:00:30] I venture to say
[1:00:33] there are texts there in John 3 16.
[1:00:38] is a lake is a river a Rio a pitcher
[1:00:45] and the word world does not mean does
[1:00:49] the the world it separates itself from
[1:00:54] God
[1:00:56] but I want you to notice this one but
[1:01:00] the great and blessed truth part here is
[1:01:05] however I may drag myself away from God
[1:01:11] I cannot drive him away from me
[1:01:18] can I say that one more time
[1:01:22] the great and blessed truth part here is
[1:01:24] that
[1:01:27] however I may drag myself away from God
[1:01:32] I cannot drive him away from me
[1:01:37] you know why he always remains brother
[1:01:41] Jacob he always remains
[1:01:45] faithfulness
[1:01:46] and he is faithful to what it is
[1:01:50] faithful to his degree is
[1:01:57] God's word is who he is
[1:02:00] when he says I will have a bride
[1:02:04] that's me
[1:02:06] faithful to that you might drag yourself
[1:02:10] away from him
[1:02:11] you can never drive yourself away
[1:02:16] go away from him
[1:02:19] he cannot get away from you
[1:02:25] from Everlasting to Everest
[1:02:28] one degree to another yeah
[1:02:36] so I look and I say you're very illegal
[1:02:40] was it it was not Christ's death that
[1:02:44] turned God from hating and being angry
[1:02:46] in order
[1:02:50] but it was God's love that appointed
[1:02:53] Christ's death
[1:02:56] no longer foreign
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:55] [Music]
[1:03:57] what
[1:04:06] does the lake do can I say and what does
[1:04:11] the river do
[1:04:12] if there's no picture
[1:04:16] take out the water but from the river
[1:04:20] we live in a Time passed by
[1:04:24] yes and when we live in that time
[1:04:29] we never let God live today
[1:04:33] when he comes to our life
[1:04:37] we come to the newness of life
[1:04:44] every day it's new mercies
[1:04:49] you find out in the scripture
[1:04:53] where the Bible speaks to us
[1:04:56] that God that a man prayed to God
[1:05:00] and all of a sudden repentance the sun
[1:05:04] was moved back 10 degrees
[1:05:07] in another occasion
[1:05:12] moved forward 10 degrees and so foreign
[1:06:28] now we've done everything that we're
[1:06:31] supposed to do
[1:06:33] just believe now and have faith the
[1:06:36] prophet of God
[1:06:39] amen amen and be reverent
[1:06:43] just have faith
[1:06:46] just believe
[1:06:49] sometimes your faith is unconscious
[1:06:54] you have it and don't know it is
[1:06:58] that little woman
[1:07:06] we understand where what we need to do
[1:07:10] and today must look at them you must
[1:07:11] guess then we come to the house of the
[1:07:13] Lord
[1:07:14] we already have it programmed in our
[1:07:17] minds
[1:07:19] if I do this I'm gonna get more of God
[1:07:24] in the first place
[1:07:26] there is more of God I must reduce than
[1:07:30] you even have a desire than to know what
[1:07:32] he is
[1:07:34] it's like saying this is I'm not going
[1:07:38] to drink this much water
[1:07:41] because there might not be enough
[1:07:44] like the little fish
[1:07:47] in the ocean if I drink too much water
[1:07:52] there won't be enough for everybody else
[1:07:55] but as he himself is
[1:08:20] I've been a Christian my whole life
[1:08:23] some people might say that I've been a
[1:08:25] good
[1:08:27] Christiano is that enough for me
[1:08:30] I've been a preacher since I was five
[1:08:33] years old
[1:08:34] I'm going on 53 years of being a
[1:08:38] preacher yeah
[1:08:39] is there anything else that I would like
[1:08:42] to do

[1:08:57] United States

[1:13:15] degree
[1:13:16] rather it's that you just don't know my
[1:13:19] life
[1:13:20] you know what happens
[1:13:22] that's what I tell people all the time
[1:13:25] you want to be a drunkard
[1:13:30] hook up with drunkards
[1:13:32] if you want to be a womanizer
[1:13:36] be around people that are womanizers
[1:13:39] you want to be a drug
[1:13:42] addicted
[1:13:45] but if you want to be the workmate flash
[1:13:50] you gotta hang around with words
[1:13:53] you gotta hang around with people I
[1:13:57] don't have their degree to your degree
[1:14:00] is a song of degrees
[1:14:05] Glory
[1:14:08] but brother you know hermano I'm trying
[1:14:11] to testify to them
[1:14:15] and most of the time they testify to you
[1:14:17] and win you uh
[1:14:24] but however when you get a little orange
[1:14:27] tree
[1:14:31] you put a little seat in the ground
[1:14:35] it breaks forth into a little tree
[1:14:39] and you take that little tree
[1:14:42] at one inch tall
[1:14:46] and set it out
[1:14:49] do you know that every orange
[1:14:53] that you'll ever pick off of that tree
[1:14:58] is in it right then is
[1:15:04] man
[1:15:05] amen you know brother brother you know
[1:15:07] you say you don't understand
[1:15:11] there are things that you cannot do
[1:15:14] I say yeah I couldn't even save myself
[1:15:16] you know you know
[1:15:18] so we get past all that right you know
[1:15:22] but how many events you don't you can't
[1:15:24] do it
[1:15:26] no you know it's only in Christ
[1:15:29] but you know brother Mark if my hope
[1:15:33] according to the Apostle Paul me
[1:15:35] Esperance
[1:15:36] if my hope rests only in Christ
[1:15:46] in other words
[1:15:48] Christ came
[1:15:50] and he died for us
[1:15:53] but you don't accept it you said no
[1:15:56] acceptance a pardon is not a pardon
[1:15:59] unless it's received
[1:16:02] this is the ministry of brother Branham
[1:16:05] foreign
[1:16:59] did he come was his message to come to
[1:17:03] pick up a bride
[1:17:06] and I say yes sir who's the bride
[1:17:13] it's a song of degrees
[1:17:15] so when brother Branham comes
[1:17:18] he comes not to produce who he is
[1:17:22] he comes only
[1:17:24] he comes to produce the word of God that
[1:17:30] would bring children
[1:17:32] and Daughters of God bring them to
[1:17:37] manifestations
[1:17:43] Glory again
[1:17:47] the little the little orange tree is
[1:17:51] it doesn't matter how small he is
[1:17:56] every orange that it will produce
[1:18:00] is in that tree yeah
[1:18:06] you might say brother I just got saved
[1:18:08] today
[1:18:10] and I say no
[1:18:13] in the mind of God
[1:18:15] our names were written in the Lamb's
[1:18:18] Book of Life
[1:18:23] we have only recognized it today
[1:18:27] everything
[1:18:29] is free every orange
[1:18:33] that we will ever produce it's right in
[1:18:37] us right now
[1:18:38] the resurrection is inside
[1:18:43] foreign
[1:18:54] I wake up in the morning
[1:18:57] and I sit down
[1:18:59] and as soon as I sit down brother Jacob
[1:19:02] again
[1:19:03] when I open my eyes
[1:19:06] when you open your eyes
[1:19:09] the devil trembles like nobody's
[1:19:13] business
[1:19:15] does not know what's inside of you
[1:19:19] but we like to help him
[1:19:23] oh I'm nobody
[1:19:26] of course we're nobody
[1:19:28] in the eyes of God
[1:19:39] we are the word of God made flesh
[1:19:43] can I tell you one thing
[1:19:46] in the degrees in Los grados
[1:19:49] sometimes
[1:19:53] can I tell you about a story
[1:19:57] of a three Hebrew children
[1:20:03] named Elijah
[1:20:05] Leos Noah Noah and Adonai Adam
[1:20:10] but for you that
[1:20:12] are stuck in history we'll call them
[1:20:16] um
[1:20:21] you know that story
[1:20:25] but did you ever know this other story
[1:20:26] of Elijah Noah and I don't know
[1:20:33] you know your story
[1:20:36] we read Lemos that
[1:20:40] story here
[1:20:42] we read
[1:20:44] what brother Branham did
[1:20:46] we read what he will do
[1:20:50] and all that is wonderful
[1:20:53] but in the middle of the pages
[1:20:57] he said in the ladder
[1:21:00] there was things written in between the
[1:21:03] lines
[1:21:13] there was uh Nebuchadnezzar made this
[1:21:17] image
[1:21:19] of gold and to cut it to Chase
[1:21:24] it was the image of Daniel
[1:21:28] they knew who Daniel was
[1:21:32] so the story continues
[1:21:35] that they said uh they accused the Jews
[1:21:40] and he said that will King has made a
[1:21:44] decree oh Grace
[1:21:47] that every man that hear the sound of
[1:21:49] the coordinate
[1:21:52] the flute the harp the plot and it keeps
[1:21:57] on going
[1:21:59] shall fall down and worship the golden
[1:22:01] image
[1:22:06] not down
[1:22:19] the grados
[1:22:21] many people don't want to go there
[1:22:24] because it's comfortable to come to the
[1:22:27] house of the Lord yes
[1:22:30] and do the same theatrics over and over
[1:22:35] tongue leader
[1:22:53] you know even if we sing uh a song
[1:22:56] called Hallelujah
[1:22:58] everybody knows
[1:23:02] nobody sings it because they don't know
[1:23:04] the word
[1:23:06] and that's the only word
[1:23:09] okay let's change it up
[1:23:11] we're gonna sing hey
[1:23:14] hey amen amen amen yeah that's the only
[1:23:19] word to the song
[1:23:21] I didn't sing because I don't know the
[1:23:24] words
[1:23:27] see
[1:23:28] you know even if I don't know the words
[1:23:31] to the song
[1:23:34] which is
[1:23:38] it's very difficult but
[1:23:40] because I I I I've tried to learn the
[1:23:43] words to the song
[1:23:46] you know there's a song that says he
[1:23:48] loves to hear the the winds and he loves
[1:23:51] to hear the birds singing
[1:23:55] But but his favorite song is above all
[1:23:59] is this is
[1:24:00] the song of the
[1:24:03] redeemedos
[1:24:05] that it doesn't matter how hot it gets
[1:24:11] Hallelujah I had a rough week I'm with
[1:24:15] us how to raise up your hand more
[1:24:16] Generations
[1:24:22] my car broke
[1:24:28] I burned the food oh
[1:24:31] [Applause]
[1:24:33] they fired me from the job oh
[1:24:37] that just means that I'm gonna get a
[1:24:39] better one
[1:24:41] anybody don't think like that is
[1:24:48] like that like that oh yeah are you are
[1:24:52] you that excited
[1:24:56] my boy got a better job he ain't that
[1:24:58] excited
[1:25:03] they had a job that paid him a little
[1:25:04] bit of money
[1:25:14] do you understand it's a song of degrees
[1:25:18] I understood what the pastor said Sunday
[1:25:21] how Glory
[1:25:23] oh Gloria there's a stimulation of
[1:25:26] Revelations
[1:25:33] they once I pull it out of them and then
[1:25:35] they're happy now
[1:25:41] and this is where where
[1:25:44] they they said this we're not going to
[1:25:48] kneel down to that image no no no
[1:25:51] because we know what our Revelation is
[1:25:53] because
[1:25:55] we know
[1:25:57] and Nebuchadnezzar says
[1:26:00] you know why
[1:26:03] the furnace isn't hot enough
[1:26:07] it's not hot enough
[1:26:09] we're gonna we're gonna heat it up seven
[1:26:12] times
[1:26:14] every age gets hotter because
[1:26:19] yeah
[1:26:21] in Ephesus they they it was hot in
[1:26:24] episode
[1:26:25] but all of a sudden
[1:26:29] it is the hottest of all is
[1:26:33] everybody's got a right
[1:26:36] you can't tell me what to do no more
[1:26:39] friend have a right

[1:26:49] Pastor Minister you can't tell me no
[1:26:52] more what you do you know
[1:26:54] right
[1:26:56] but then there are people of God
[1:27:00] surrendered the rights
[1:27:03] and understand the degree that God wants
[1:27:07] to use
[1:27:11] and they said
[1:27:12] we will not serve any Gods
[1:27:16] neither will we worship the image that
[1:27:19] you need something
[1:27:23] he says
[1:27:25] fire it up
[1:27:30] and every day
[1:27:32] you know life is
[1:27:38] so I think I'm gonna move over there
[1:27:41] yeah
[1:27:44] the grass is greener over there
[1:27:48] but that grass still needs to be mowed
[1:27:54] and since you don't live there
[1:27:57] it looks prettier
[1:28:00] until you get there
[1:28:05] and when you get there
[1:28:07] ah it's just like where I just left oh
[1:28:10] is
[1:28:11] you know why because the problems are in
[1:28:14] here
[1:28:16] they followed you from here to there
[1:28:18] yeah
[1:28:23] this is where it all comes out of yeah
[1:28:26] this is the Fountain of there there
[1:28:29] comes lying lust murders everything is
[1:28:39] when we go and listen to the degree
[1:28:45] your wife might say I love you
[1:28:49] but it doesn't sound as good as the
[1:28:51] other girl
[1:28:55] I raise up my hands in church
[1:28:57] but it's not as good as when almonds
[1:29:00] right it's Saturday night
[1:29:03] dancing to the cumbias
[1:29:06] get going
[1:29:09] that takes you to another degree
[1:29:13] and then you you
[1:29:15] sell out your love that you have for God
[1:29:20] to the things of the world
[1:29:22] because you know they're temporary
[1:29:26] and you give up the Eternal
[1:29:30] for right now
[1:29:32] and you say whereas my relationship with
[1:29:36] God
[1:29:38] it's a song of degrees

[1:34:31] and as he passed by on his way to
[1:34:35] England
[1:34:38] the captain says

[2:18:10] you know I'm glad
[2:18:12] Christmas this year is on a Sunday
[2:18:18] now I gotta say this
[2:18:20] I say this for a purpose
[2:18:23] someone that said they weren't going to
[2:18:25] come to church on Sunday because it was
[2:18:27] Christmas
[2:18:30] broke my heart
[2:18:34] because then Christmas has just become a
[2:18:36] celebration to the people
[2:18:39] celebration we've made it into just
[2:18:41] receiving presents and gifts and trees
[2:18:44] and
[2:19:31] my goodness
[2:19:33] and the greatest present this is my
[2:19:35] message first next Sunday yesterday
[2:19:37] the greatest gift God ever gave to us
[2:19:42] the gift of his only begotten son
[2:19:45] he is the firstborn
[2:19:51] and he has made a church
[2:19:54] and it's called The Church of the
[2:19:56] firstborn
[2:19:57] so if you want to know more about it you
[2:20:00] come on Sunday

[2:20:05] before we leave and I know you come this
[2:20:08] morning and some of you go back home and
[2:20:10] say ah no I got other things to do this

[2:22:27] I said do you think you became king just
[2:22:30] so that you could puff your chest out
[2:22:32] and say I'm a king or what
[2:22:36] the Bible says God puts Kings and he
[2:22:39] takes away Kings
