[57:40] amen as we look at all those videos my
[57:45] message may be just for just for a few
[57:47] moments now again Tommy mensaje poco we
[57:50] realized that that as Jesus memos cómo
[57:52] es qué hey Suz as he looked at the at
[57:54] the multitude and preaching all day long
[57:58] and obvious that he can do it he looked
[58:00] and saw that they were hungry we don't
[58:01] get any a number right sometimes we say
[58:04] well that's not the gospel
[58:05] it is a noisy noisy luckily muchos deal
[58:07] and if it's in the gospel it is the
[58:09] gospel he's done Delamar kill us they'll
[58:10] ever heal you now we understand that
[58:12] there are different parts of it and then
[58:13] them escape artists if and then there
[58:15] are things that as human beings we have
[58:17] compassion towards people EK courses
[58:19] work it didn't I cook tenemos come come
[58:21] Paseo the Bible says that Jesus looked
[58:23] at the crowd and saw that they are
[58:25] hungry they saw a multi-tool if you hear
[58:28] and read it and they had heard him look
[58:30] yeah yeah pretty how they were hungry
[58:32] and Jesus said I don't want to send them
[58:35] home hungry he hadn't but he looked at
[58:39] the crowd and and he had compassion on
[58:41] them
[58:41] Meola multitude to a compassion and that
[58:44] compassion is a company or her
[58:46] something that was so great before I
[58:49] look at that gun it produced the
[58:51] creative Word of God I'm gonna say it
[58:54] again
[58:55] the compassion that Jesus had on the
[58:57] crowd like okay - okay sue saleable tea
[59:00] - produced a creation brother who
[59:02] nacreous here and that's where he began
[59:04] to create the bread face and final test
[59:09] Bible says that he fed more than 5,000
[59:11] this is a really really compare of
[59:13] majestic combo we look at those things
[59:14] and those things are needful Mira Moses
[59:17] of course I saw necessary yes we
[59:18] understand once again that that's part
[59:20] of the gospel it's our love for God's
[59:24] people that constrains us to do what we
[59:26] do it's el amor que tenemos a la gente
[59:28] que no sambuca but we also understand
[59:31] that that's not the main part of the
[59:32] gospel and Emmas que no la parte de
[59:34] prisa birthday we do those things I say
[59:36] mostly you have many churches do those
[59:38] things many churches and many
[59:40] humanitarian organizations do those
[59:43] things they'll go and they'll feed the
[59:46] people
[59:47] they'll help people and we feel good
[59:50] when we're able to do something like
[59:52] that for the people so we want to tell
[59:56] you that Satan don't care if we do that
[59:58] or not this morning
[1:00:01] I'm gonna say it again saying don't care
[1:00:03] if we do those things I said another
[1:00:05] import that cat I'm saying it's okay to
[1:00:07] build churches it's okay okay to to feed
[1:00:10] the poor to do all these other things
[1:00:13] yes though but that don't get same out
[1:00:16] of bed a la cama I'm gonna say it again

[1:00:23] somebody said not long ago I'll get the
[1:00:25] horn hace mucho el why do all these
[1:00:26] people do these things and they have no
[1:00:28] resistance forget that him testator esta
[1:00:30] noite resistant seems like they have it
[1:00:32] easy very sick is that fasting I said
[1:00:34] because all hell is not against them
[1:00:36] poor cat understand contra days all hell
[1:00:39] is against the message of the hour that
[1:00:41] we preach because it has the power to
[1:00:45] bring souls worship are afraid
[1:00:48] has the power to reach down to those
[1:00:50] that are lost power to make a person as
[1:00:55] they do nothing stop and change them
[1:00:57] from a church memory capella you
[1:00:59] membrane and it heals them into a son
[1:01:01] and daughter of God
[1:01:02] they're known equality that is why hell
[1:01:04] is against this that's why when we go we
[1:01:07] got to make sure that everything is in
[1:01:11] order
[1:01:12] get those they're not we cannot go out
[1:01:14] there and try to be a light to the world

[1:08:34] setting on a hill you're the royal seat
[1:08:38] of Abraham okay now wherever we're at
[1:08:41] out on the Killick wherever we may go on
[1:08:43] the kid okay my young there's only one
[1:08:45] thing that will give us a thority over
[1:08:48] the enemy come on that Cossack end of
[1:08:50] that out Tory that's what Elenin are you
[1:08:51] with me Church it's that there's only
[1:08:53] one thing that'll give us a thority over
[1:08:55] the enemies I'll tell you he comes in a
[1:08:58] lot of form you think Missy Libyan in he
[1:09:00] comes in different ways different is
[1:09:02] most you got to be on the alert because
[1:09:04] that I let it down but I'm thankful to
[1:09:06] God yes there is one thing okay you're
[1:09:10] not course that God gives us knows that
[1:09:12] that'll give us the authority a lot of
[1:09:14] stories over the enemy so real enemy go
[1:09:16] in the church age book in a little
[1:09:18] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:09:21] so nobody want to know what it is
[1:09:23] we're case one thing it gives you the
[1:09:27] authority common is that loud told you
[1:09:28] that he said it is the revelation of God
[1:09:31] is that revelation the deals that will
[1:09:33] give you the authority over the Doctore
[1:09:35] that's what El Diablo yeah yeah well I
[1:09:39] know a lot of word brother they don't
[1:09:41] give you a
[1:09:42] sharpener hello everybody well I do a
[1:09:46] lot of praying that's good mooch okay
[1:09:48] but it's the revelation of the word but
[1:09:50] a little assume that is the authority
[1:09:53] that because when all we have is a
[1:09:56] second hand revelation of the man I said
[1:10:01] that because the brother said it but if
[1:10:03] it's not a revelation to you can you
[1:10:07] have any kind of authority over the over
[1:10:09] the enemy what was that they I'm not the
[1:10:11] real enemy was impossible simple simply
[1:10:14] and you can see why you step with an
[1:10:16] adult you add or take away from the word
[1:10:18] it's cursed
[1:10:19] I need any key pennies in a Malaysian it
[1:10:21] would have to be so in the accuracy or
[1:10:24] if you add or take away from the perfect
[1:10:26] revelation of God or kiss yeah how can
[1:10:30] you overcome the enemy come on I mean
[1:10:32] it's that simple he says son simply
[1:10:35] there is nothing of such prevailing
[1:10:37] power might not come on boys through
[1:10:40] their privileges I gotta say this and
[1:10:42] say it with all clarity okay see look on
[1:10:45] there is nothing of such prevailing
[1:10:48] power no I know that contempt for their
[1:10:50] privileges or has the revelation of the
[1:10:53] word revelation de la palabra the
[1:10:57] problem today and preliminary is that
[1:10:59] people mistake knowledge for revelation
[1:11:02] in the history era but I cannot forget
[1:11:04] to put on I read that you already know
[1:11:07] that joy yes a if I need you a long time
[1:11:09] ago
[1:11:09] I say mucho because you may have
[1:11:11] knowledge of something you're gonna see
[1:11:13] me but once again knowledge does not
[1:11:15] equivalent revelation
[1:11:17] conocimiento no equally alas area I
[1:11:20] believe that you can go from knowledge
[1:11:22] to revelation opens or reveals some
[1:11:27] deals just because you have knowledge of
[1:11:30] something doesn't mean you have
[1:11:32] revelation or not for Catina
[1:11:33] conocimiento KCK Gila River last you'll
[1:11:36] automatically and we gotta know those
[1:11:38] things change
[1:11:38] tenemos que sirve area so it's good to
[1:11:40] have knowledge yes we're not gonna see
[1:11:42] we got a study to show ourselves
[1:11:43] approved but it must gets to the other
[1:11:45] person once God comes on the scene
[1:11:48] co-ceos Bengal asana it's not the pastor
[1:11:51] that can give you revelation nozzle
[1:11:53] pastor Caleb Arabella's is not
