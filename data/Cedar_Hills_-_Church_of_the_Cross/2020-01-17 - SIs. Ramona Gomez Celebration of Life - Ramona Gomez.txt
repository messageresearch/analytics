time but I cannot have to write a theme that we all are to stare death in the face and say I am not afraid of you mira la muerte like I write this literally no let em oh I were to ask a question this day cierra la pregunta Oy if you knew that you were gonna die tomorrow Javier Akiva morir mañana what would you change Guerra Loki become mirrors what would you do differently today kçêäa differente stay Zoe I want to quote the Apostle Paul Jarris eternal a post Olsen what he had to say about death look in the book of first Corinthians the fifteenth chapter and in Libra the pre-medical interest capital o Keeffe 54th to the 55th verse they were so cincuenta Quattro Cinque when they sing it says when this corruptible shall put on incorruption understood corrupt Avista incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality mr. Mort else if he's telling mortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written and to Sicily that El dish okay they say death is swallowed up in victory la muerte por la victoria then he stands and he makes this statement is the para sa like lettuce you he says o death the same where take where's dice team and don't they start to Aggie ho grave is a fulcrum where is thy victory understand to be told here was a man a mortal man that could stare death in the face I guess that one hombre morte alchemy now and say where is your sting you see I don't de stuck or Not Afraid of you death not at the moment you see death is like is like a bee lemarcus come una vaca goes around and and it takes its stinger and it puts it in in different people you know I like it yeah a soggy horn ah diferentes and throughout time man has always feared death yeah Travis de todos tiempos el hombre tell me because they didn't know what to expect but can answer me no kiss better job saw how man that would die hope Mira como scale hombre Maria then he'd say but but but why is there not Dwight we not see man raise up again they don't scale hombre we see the flowers die there there during the the fall in tip epoch and get lost in the ring they raise up again in the tree is the same they lose their leaves los árboles know what about man ok the Loom goes down into the ground viola Tierra and then we don't see no more of him yeah but one day this be called death he it's stung the wrong person let P coil unbreakable its aw man by the name of Jesus Mirel Umbria mother Jesu Christo what he didn't know was that Jesus was not just a man look at most obvious case the hombre no stolen he was the god man I don't normally the austere that was God in flesh he does do st. Carney and when this this became any stung him he contrasted heaven because he tried to pull his stinger out and couldn't suppose I kind of like honey he had to leave his stinger in this man called Jesus so what can I hide a saggy hornet alone therefore from that point on this is a pun to another land he had no stinger anymore Yankee now death is nothing but a scarecrow about a Martinez musky it was assumed in the back make you fear okay I said make my Rambo sorry but that's why Paul could stand up and say these words there so Paolo pepper all it does they are a smart thing death where is your sting don't it's not talking Oh grave where is your victory sepulchral don't they start to Victoria and you look at this of this this tremendous man by the name of the Apostle Paul and ohmmeter own most humbly tantra mental apostle's i ask the question again what would you do if you knew that you were gonna die tomorrow la pregunta travis quisiera ok come be honest I'll tell you what Paul did they can be silly lo que Pablo he's tall sat there and began to write and Peter says what are you doing Paul in the here on casters problem writing a letter it's Karuna he was not crying he was not having regrets nothing happened he was simply writing a letter to Timothy solo nice communicati motel encouraging him and the believers island under a yellow screen this is what is said in the book of second Timothy the fourth chapter yesterday say implements a lunatic motels Quattro for I am now ready to be offered is they are to listo para ser efficient at the time of the of my departure is at hand Hill tempos mi parte de esta la mano I have fought a good fight opinion when I believe that sister Ramona can say the same thing broken mister man and I'm gonna play she bought a good fight yeah P Luna when our time I have finished my course he says it didn't mean on me kudos and I have kept the faith he meant a needle FA henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness in Atlanta mechanic or owner who steals which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day yes in your justo quest monotonous ADEA and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing then atossa kills garments or Parisien they asked a man by the name of John Wesley la pregunta no nombre what he would do differently if he knew he was gonna die the next day kre-o diferente cease to be arequipa Marilla see into the abyss he replied I estoy el contest oh I would do what I had already planned you are here look at you he applied in other words I wouldn't change one thing of what I'm doing it doesn't know combat it come because he had already committed his life to Christ for compromise movie that Chris he didn't have nothing else that he would change nothing I'll kick him beyond how once again is it possible though she's calm as possible that a human being can see death or what it really is Romano para la muerte por lo que es another tremendous man by the name of FF Bosworth's author hombre ml o FF Bosworth was asked this question la pregunta of all your long life for Christ this is a thought to be that case video for Chris when was the greatest time of your life and your ministry cuando el tiempo must remember to be the ministerial was it when maybe that you got married he says cuando te Casas and you had your first child which is that to put America was it maybe when you were praying for the second and and they would recover Oakland or hospitals and pharmacies and now have that Bosworth looked up and said it's your password dijo the greatest time of my whole life and temple muscle and also that Tommy Vida is right now in Sonora said buddy but you're at you're on your deathbed that wasn't delicious and what he said but for the last 60 years he's a federal lawsuit I have a story to the Lord instead of visuals I'd given him everything to him he said so now what I have preached about ordered a look a pretty car one I have loved my whole life he said ride any moment now and question woman he'll bring humming through those doors and set up what it says but he'll be taking me home to be with him he mr.

and Sonia yeah man at the end or Gomez done yeah come here on not getting on a soda coca-cola to be exact these are just some of the things we heard whenever we visited grandma's house she was a very hard-working independent and strong-willed mother sister and grandmother and friend who battled into her final days we always looked forward to the holidays at Grandma's house the smell of mint although the maila's mean we're lost that she made would feel her quaint home she'd call you to come pick up your tamales and eat menudo there was always plenty never did she say she didn't have enough when she gave she gave from the heart and it showed everything she did was wholeheartedly her life wasn't about what she did what she had or didn't have it was more about helping and giving to others and for this a Lord truly blessed her always she was persistent and insisted on doing things for herself until she went to be with the Lord she always thanked the Lord for her health and forgiving her strengths she showed us a were Catholic ethic like no other having worked at Stallman farms for over 60 years as a pillar of strength for our family she helped many of us during difficult times in her life sometimes not knowing how much we needed it pray that the strength she had is bestowed upon her family during this much-needed time lastly as she told us in her final days she prayed for everyone and asked the Lord to take care of everyone you did it matter who you were where you came from or why she always opened her home to whoever whomever came and made sure you left with the full belly I drink in hand coca-cola not water Pepsi not sprite coca-cola or oreganata but most of all her blessing did I leave you with today Joseph been the girl of squeeza my grandma was a strongest person I know she was fearless when she was faced with a difficult circumstance she didn't folds her hands up in two feet but she would roll up her sleeves and face it with courage she was never one to complain about anything even through to her last days when she was bedridden I would go and visit her and say hi grandma wants a letter she would answer was he and me huh and she would say it in such a way as up to say well what else do you expect of course I'm doing good she wasn't afraid of death one day my mom mentioned to her that a lot of people from the little town were dying my grandma said C Eon the sweat thought up Ilona and my mom told her if she comes knocking don't open the door my grandma replied death is afraid of me my grandma taught us many lessons such as even when it seems like you don't have anything the Lord will provide when you give from your heart a blessing will always come back to you she would say don't pray don't just pray for your own she would pray for every state in every country those in hospitals and prisons and for those who didn't have anything to eat most of all she was always grateful to God for everything in the good times and in the hard times she was the happiest when she could give and didn't expect anything in return I honestly believe she worked until she was 87 years old so she could have more to give or to be able to help someone our prophet brother Branham teaches us that eternal life is living for others and this quote that he preached in the sermon that day on Calvary reminded me of her now the first thing that I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and do good things that's fine but when you live your life for yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God he had lived and he had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and he receive eternal life by receiving that day and you live for yourself no more you live for others that's what my grandma did that's who she was she lived for others we were thankful to
