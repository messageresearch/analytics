[49:46] to the letter biblia completa hasta la
[49:48] letra john the baptist
[49:51] his messenger before his face

[53:25] perverts
[53:38] we become perverted by many times what's
[53:40] permitted into the church
[53:43] so there is then always a showdown
[53:47] because we many times we are not holding
[53:50] up the standard of the word
[53:54] we know the story andrea had married an
[53:57] unbeliever named jezebel
[54:00] she had brought in with her the worship
[54:03] of of of all these strange gods
[54:08] and he had permitted this idolatry to
[54:10] come into israel
[54:14] and the condition of the people
[54:18] was a divided mind
[54:21] that was producing two opinions
[54:25] i want to say that again because there
[54:27] is something that is so good here
[54:30] the condition of the people
[54:33] was a divided mind
[54:36] reducing
[54:49] our minds are quickly
[55:04] this oh i says
[55:06] oh well let me show you a different way
[55:08] let me show you something different
[55:11] let me show you something better
[55:14] how many of you young people you you
[55:15] ever experienced that with with someone
[55:18] out there
[55:47] oh no
[55:48] okay
[55:49] yeah there's a lot now
[55:51] how about you your parents and ikelos
[55:55] everywhere you go there's a showdown
[55:56] right
[55:58] now nowadays there's a showdown just to
[55:59] find a parking space
[56:17] but it doesn't matter where you go
[56:18] there's a confrontation and there's a
[56:20] struggle all the time
[56:24] and here is what elijah is telling me or
[56:27] is telling
[56:28] them and description i want you to get
[56:31] this because
[56:33] this scripture
[56:35] it it didn't make too much sense to me
[56:40] i believe it you're like
[56:42] but it didn't make a whole lot of sense
[56:44] to me
[56:46] nothing's wrong with the scripture
[56:48] but what is wrong is my perception or
[56:50] understanding of the scriptures
[56:55] but many times we don't we read
[56:56] something we don't we don't get it
[57:00] i didn't get this first kings that we
[57:02] read in 1821
[57:06] it comes unto all the people and says
[57:09] how long halt ye between
[57:24] brother what what do you mean you don't
[57:26] get it
[57:28] easy it's fascinating you have two
[57:29] opinions
[57:30] those opinions the people's minds were
[57:32] divided
[57:35] but but watch what elijah is telling
[57:38] them and i'm going to give you
[57:41] six different versions of of of bibles
[57:46] you can really understand what's going
[57:48] on here
[57:51] the king james version says
[58:03] how long go ye limping
[58:06] between
[58:20] the next one how long will ye hesitate
[58:24] between two opinions
[58:28] the next one is how much longer will you
[58:30] try to have things both ways
[58:42] how long are you going to be paralyzed
[58:45] by indecision
[58:48] and
[58:59] i don't know what to do i don't know
[59:00] what to do
[59:09] and i read this scripture and i said
[59:11] lord i don't i i i understand what it's
[59:13] saying here
[59:16] but
[59:45] because as i read it it sounds like this
[59:49] sounds like the scripture is saying that
[59:52] there are two opinions for you to choose
[59:54] from
[59:57] if the lord be god then follow him
[1:00:00] that's one yes
[1:00:03] then follow him
[1:00:05] use you this day which opinion you're
[1:00:08] going to go with
[1:00:11] and that don't make sense to me yes
[1:00:26] it
[1:00:40] between
[1:00:55] god being that the lord being god
[1:00:59] has simply been an opinion to them
[1:01:03] so why are you going back and forth with
[1:01:05] these two opinions
[1:01:20] stop
[1:01:21] choosing or trying to choose between
[1:01:23] these two
[1:01:26] we're trying to to put this as an
[1:01:28] opinion almost an opinion don't do that
[1:01:31] no i got it how many are with me
[1:01:33] and this is what elijah's telling them
[1:01:35] and now he's saying if god be god
[1:01:39] then follow him
[1:01:42] watch watch as this unfolds
[1:01:45] because an opinion
[1:01:48] this is very important to understand the
[1:01:49] messages
[1:01:55] is that when you are wavering between
[1:01:56] two opinions
[1:02:00] why is the lord being god still an
[1:02:03] opinion just an opinion
[1:02:18] indecisive
[1:02:20] why are you
[1:02:21] halting between two opinions
[1:02:25] he's a prophet he's not a problem
[1:02:27] when somebody comes and tells you
[1:02:28] something and shows you something
[1:02:31] that they found on the internet
[1:02:46] as long
[1:03:01] is the beliefs
[1:03:03] yes or views of this of a large number
[1:03:07] or majority of people
[1:03:11] it's the belief
[1:03:14] how many believe that the bible is right
[1:03:20] there's a song that says i know the
[1:03:21] bible is right
[1:03:26] somebody is wrong
[1:03:28] i know the bible is right
[1:03:31] and somebody's wrong
[1:03:34] i don't told you once
[1:03:36] he has told you twice
[1:03:38] can't make it to heaven with a
[1:03:40] sweetheart and a wife
[1:03:42] i know the bible is right
[1:03:45] and somebody's wrong
[1:03:49] what has this an opinion is a belief an
[1:03:52] opinion
[1:03:54] or the views of a large or majority of
[1:03:56] people
[1:04:14] [Music]
[1:04:51] why aren't we basing our whole lives
[1:05:06] your opinions so opinions and our
[1:05:09] beliefs
[1:05:10] that are not based on god's word
[1:05:14] based on fact or knowledge
[1:05:17] you've seen me follow the majority of
[1:05:19] the people and not god
[1:05:34] how many have ever used that that phrase
[1:05:41] i always had everybody who seemed to be
[1:05:43] older than me
[1:05:47] you do it i'll do it
[1:06:16] i'm not talking
[1:06:29] oh nobody ever does that here
[1:06:32] the lord we don't have nobody
[1:06:35] i'm dealing with this with my family
[1:06:39] and it's like don't you
[1:06:41] don't you go and approach the lord about
[1:06:43] this
[1:06:44] pregnant
[1:06:55] and that's what elijah is saying why ho
[1:06:57] chi between two opinions
[1:07:12] show
[1:07:24] asking the whole world
[1:07:40] yeah here we go here we go now this is
[1:07:42] what we're we're getting to something
[1:07:44] hell why hold g between two opinions
[1:07:48] now he brings the word to the forefront
[1:07:53] and he says if the lord be god then
[1:07:55] follow him because if you see he says
[1:07:57] again now say that this morning if god
[1:07:59] be god then follow him this morning
[1:08:03] don't look to the right don't look to
[1:08:05] the left
[1:08:06] stay focused on the word
[1:08:22] comes for this
[1:08:36] the word
[1:08:49] is your belief based upon opinions
[1:08:53] or upon the eternal immovable infallible
[1:08:56] word of god
[1:09:01] imagine
[1:09:02] god of all creations
[1:09:19] imagine saying oh i wonder sometimes
[1:09:20] what he thinks
[1:09:23] look at all this
[1:09:25] oh the word is my absolutely
[1:09:29] why are we halting between two opinions
[1:09:32] that's right
[1:09:35] mayor with me this morning man come on
[1:09:37] now why are we halting between sometimes
[1:09:40] not two
[1:09:41] sometimes 10 or 12 or 20 years
[1:09:45] why are we stopping between those why
[1:09:46] are we paralyzed
[1:09:48] i don't know why no but nothing goes my
[1:09:50] way brother
[1:09:52] you don't know
[1:09:53] i'll tell you why you got too many
[1:09:55] opinions
[1:09:57] why don't you throw them all away
[1:09:59] and get serious
[1:10:20] when you halt between opinions
[1:10:23] you show that the word is not your
[1:10:25] absolute
[1:10:27] opinion
[1:10:39] and you're basing your whole life
[1:10:42] on opinions and opinions instead of on
[1:10:44] the word
[1:10:46] that's right
[1:10:47] i'm going to say it again until it
[1:10:49] becomes a revelation to you
[1:10:53] just
[1:10:53] an opinion
[1:10:56] and i go to that church your way i see
[1:10:57] listen yeah we believe this
[1:10:59] but it's so just your opinion of it
[1:11:02] you read the bible
[1:11:04] and you say i believe that yo it's just
[1:11:06] your opinion
[1:11:08] you read the message
[1:11:09] i believe that you're
[1:11:29] i don't know if brother branham is a
[1:11:31] prophet anymore
[1:11:34] opinions are things that have not been
[1:11:36] settled in you opinions
[1:11:50] they are not the ultimate
[1:11:55] and they can be changed or altered in a
[1:11:58] moment's time
[1:12:02] come on now i'm going to say this again
[1:12:03] church because i got to get you in this
[1:12:05] foundation
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:21] how is it that we can be so on fire for
[1:12:23] the lord and we get out of service
[1:12:28] we don't see that we don't see eye to
[1:12:30] eye
[1:12:32] we don't lie
[1:12:34] and then we're sitting like this
[1:13:01] it's not each other
[1:13:18] are they following me by an opinion
[1:13:21] by revelation
[1:13:23] and i want to ask you that this morning
[1:13:26] you're going to follow just as long as
[1:13:27] you like the way things are in church
[1:13:33] we're always going to find things we
[1:13:34] just dislike and don't agree with and
[1:13:36] you're entitled to your opinion
[1:13:40] when it comes then the showdown begins
[1:13:44] he says
[1:13:58] now i'm coming to each one of you
[1:14:01] opinions of everybody else
[1:14:04] there's going to be a showdown
[1:14:06] whoever told you that you should deal
[1:14:08] with it this way
[1:14:11] it's against the word
[1:14:20] and then let's really see what's going
[1:14:22] on here
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:40] let him
[1:15:02] and then it'll never be up for debate
[1:15:06] ever again
[1:15:35] behold i send you
[1:15:48] when somebody wants to come and tell me
[1:15:50] it's not so you're too late
[1:15:54] up against the concrete
[1:15:59] wonder we can't bring god on the scene
[1:16:03] who he is
[1:16:17] watch as we get into the message
[1:16:32] all right now we're now we're turning
[1:16:34] the corner into our message now
[1:16:38] the mount carmel showdown once again
[1:16:45] that god above us is
[1:17:14] it proves if something is an opinion
[1:17:18] it is an actual revolution
[1:17:21] when you come to a real showdown
[1:17:28] i'm going to say it again
[1:18:09] i think i'm part of the bride of jesus
[1:18:10] christ
[1:18:16] i think i'm going to make the rapture
[1:18:19] another opinion
[1:18:21] i think i think i think
[1:18:23] and that's the problem
[1:18:39] you have an opinion about it
[1:18:42] you're going to make it because it has
[1:18:43] been revealed to you through the word
[1:18:47] you'll be there
[1:18:49] the resurrection of the saints
[1:19:03] the bible is not a book of opinions
[1:19:33] word of god
[1:19:36] [Applause]
[1:19:40] now now watch this now the thing we're
[1:19:43] trying to drive home today is this
[1:19:46] just because we say the word is our
[1:19:49] absolute
[1:19:51] absolute doesn't necessarily mean it's
[1:19:53] true
[1:19:56] we can have a belief that is formed by
[1:19:58] our opinions
[1:20:02] rather than by revelation
[1:20:05] how many are with me
[1:20:07] all that i've said because we're gonna
[1:20:09] we're building up to something now
[1:20:11] okay
[1:20:13] real quick forward fast forward to the
[1:20:15] second showdown
[1:20:25] [Music]
[1:20:30] emmanuel
[1:20:32] god with us
[1:20:36] it's a showdown
[1:20:38] to prove what once again
[1:20:40] that it's god with us now
[1:20:43] no longer is god above
[1:20:52] that jesus was truly the virgin born son
[1:20:56] of god
[1:21:10] matthew 16 13.
[1:21:16] and we the last time we spoke everybody
[1:21:18] remember
[1:21:19] okay let let me have a quick quick
[1:21:23] question
[1:21:26] you ready you ready i'm watching you all
[1:21:30] right
[1:21:32] what city was known as the gates of
[1:21:33] hello
[1:21:42] what was that again
[1:21:44] that's right caesarea philippi that's
[1:21:47] right
[1:21:48] all right so good i'm glad you
[1:21:50] remembered that
[1:21:52] now he's here and we went over this and
[1:21:54] we this is so well known
[1:21:58] but watch
[1:21:59] as he's trying to get these disciples to
[1:22:03] you need to serve him by revelation
[1:22:08] so the first thing he does is say okay
[1:22:10] i know you've been hearing everybody
[1:22:12] else
[1:22:16] the lord knows these things
[1:22:18] i know you've been on over there here in
[1:22:21] tbn
[1:22:40] you see so many things
[1:22:43] i know you've been watching every
[1:22:44] preacher that's on
[1:22:46] youtube
[1:22:49] so answer me the question whom do men
[1:22:51] say that i the son of man
[1:22:55] i want to know what all the opinions are
[1:23:00] and so they start
[1:23:02] they give themselves away that they have
[1:23:04] been listening to everybody
[1:23:07] some say that thou art
[1:23:09] john the baptist
[1:23:17] jeremiah
[1:24:29] that's awesome
[1:24:31] i'll give you the keys for that one
[1:24:33] this rock confession was spoken at the
[1:24:35] gates of hell
[1:24:41] we see jesus and on
[1:24:56] you have moses the law there
[1:24:59] you have elijah
[1:25:00] after the translators
[1:25:02] you have a rehearsal of the resurrection
[1:25:04] going on
[1:25:07] what a showdown
[1:25:08] it's a preview of what's coming
[1:25:24] oh
[1:25:32] while he had spake behold a bright cloud
[1:25:34] overshadowed them
[1:25:36] and a voice out of the cloud which said
[1:25:39] this is my
[1:25:41] beloved son
[1:25:50] that's not an opinion
[1:26:20] why are we still trying to live back
[1:26:22] there
[1:26:24] why don't we live here right now
[1:26:28] this is my beloved son who i am pleased
[1:26:30] to i'm whom i am well please brother ram
[1:26:32] says please to dwell in yesterday
[1:27:21] you can
[1:27:22] you can
[1:27:23] as as they say
[1:27:25] we can repeat
[1:27:27] all that is the law and the prophets
[1:27:32] but watching in matthew 22 41
[1:27:36] when the pharisees were gathered and
[1:27:39] jesus asked them
[1:27:41] what they think about something
[1:27:44] they were gathered
[1:28:08] um
[1:28:09] they said
[1:28:10] we got some
[1:28:12] we
[1:28:26] so you think because you read it
[1:28:29] you got it did you understand it
[1:28:31] okay
[1:28:33] how then does david in spirit call him
[1:28:35] lord
[1:28:38] saying the lord said unto my lord
[1:28:53] and no man was able to answer
[1:29:08] there absolutely
[1:29:10] absolutely and we many times can we can
[1:29:13] repeat what the prophet says
[1:29:18] that doesn't make it or absolutely
[1:29:20] absolutely that's right
[1:29:22] we can have an opinion about it
[1:29:25] doesn't make it our absolutely no no no
[1:29:27] no
[1:29:28] we can fight it till we're blue in the
[1:29:30] face
[1:29:36] why
[1:29:36] because we like to pick and choose
[1:29:40] what is easy to live of the scriptures
[1:29:47] and they become
[1:29:49] our opinions
[1:30:05] in this form
[1:30:08] the bible is absolute
[1:30:11] it is the truth
[1:30:14] but the letter kills
[1:30:22] this is where we get into little
[1:30:23] nitty-gritty there huh
[1:30:26] because now everybody's like whoa
[1:30:28] how many have ever used that phrase the
[1:30:29] word is my absolutely
[1:30:43] everything i've said is to bring you and
[1:30:44] draw you into this now look at is
[1:30:59] are any of the prophets back there
[1:31:02] jesus fulfilled it all
[1:31:05] testament
[1:31:08] oh it's the word oh that's my absolutely
[1:31:11] we don't live in a past this
[1:31:13] dispensation
[1:32:20] that's the dispensation we are talking
[1:32:22] about
[1:33:06] watch as this
[1:33:21] those things are all right and you
[1:33:22] should do those things
[1:33:25] but the word doesn't become our absolute
[1:33:28] because of that
[1:33:32] as long as the word stays in letter form
[1:33:41] i'm going to say it again as long as the
[1:33:43] word stays in book form
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:48] be your
[1:34:02] what is written is absolutely yes
[1:34:10] but the manifestation of this word
[1:34:15] is the producing of a person
[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:58] the logos and logos that's who is our
[1:35:01] god
[1:35:03] lord who art paul says
[1:35:07] i am jesus whoa what
[1:35:10] how can it be jesus
[1:35:12] when
[1:35:53] but he was living and looking in a past
[1:35:55] dispensation
[1:35:58] but when that person came on the scene
[1:36:02] showed himself
[1:36:04] his redemptive work
[1:36:06] he goes back to logos
[1:36:20] this is not an opinion anymore
[1:36:35] but he was persecuting the christians
[1:36:39] watch now
[1:36:40] if the word became flesh and dwelt
[1:36:42] amongst us
[1:36:44] the word now is a person
[1:36:47] when the person of the lord jesus
[1:36:50] comes
[1:37:03] yes
[1:37:16] but as long as it stays in letter form
[1:37:31] how many are with me now what is
[1:37:46] fine
[1:37:48] though you've had a lot of work this
[1:37:50] week i know there is there
[1:37:54] tend to preach a little length
[1:37:57] but i ain't even
[1:38:01] let close go on
[1:38:03] let me know now watch this now
[1:38:05] what is written is absolute once again
[1:38:09] but the manifestation of the word is the
[1:38:11] producing of the person
[1:38:14] is
[1:38:42] foreign
[1:38:56] it changed paul forever
[1:39:00] he would never be the same
[1:39:03] though his ambitions were high
[1:39:06] his goals and ambitions had changed
[1:39:26] separated me from my mother's womb and
[1:39:28] called me by his grace
[1:39:32] to reveal
[1:39:33] his son
[1:39:34] in me
[1:39:36] and no longer is an opinion
[1:40:06] and there's so many things you can talk
[1:40:08] about of these showdowns but like i said
[1:40:09] i was just going to hit the highlights
[1:40:12] what did this showdown produce
[1:40:15] the revealing of the sun
[1:40:19] the word
[1:40:32] to his agenda
[1:40:48] so much
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:58] think
[1:42:00] why do we want to just come to church
[1:42:04] we don't like about it
[1:42:06] missed the whole thing
[1:42:08] wow
[1:42:10] i'm gonna say it again
[1:42:12] the showdown

[1:42:52] where actually does he live
[1:43:09] let's see if we stay too long on our
[1:43:10] youtube channels on saturday nights
[1:43:16] wow
[1:43:18] what is your absolutely
[1:43:36] he has
[1:44:19] he has no mouth but mine in yours
[1:44:23] and as long as we're halting between two
[1:44:25] opinions
[1:44:31] and we sing i've anchored in jesus
[1:44:34] christ
[1:44:36] i'm coming to this now i'm coming around
[1:44:38] the corner
[1:44:39] this is this is my whole message that
[1:44:40] i'm coming to you
[1:44:42] in just like 15 minutes can you
[1:44:44] and then i'm coming to the to the main
[1:44:47] part of it of the message
[1:44:51] of life all brave
[1:44:52] jesus
[1:44:57] how many believe that
[1:44:58] he is
[1:45:29] [Applause]
[1:45:54] the word ties itself back
[1:46:12] but if you don't believe me i'm going to
[1:46:13] shout i'm going to show you here put
[1:46:14] that put that quote on an absolute
[1:46:16] fantasy
[1:46:22] ultimate
[1:46:24] that's
[1:46:36] but i met something
[1:46:41] and since
[1:46:42] that
[1:46:43] came into me
[1:46:47] in that day you'll know
[1:46:50] that i am in the father he just told
[1:46:51] your father
[1:47:18] and then god separating his life
[1:47:42] watch this now it don't make any
[1:47:44] difference what others want to believe
[1:47:46] that's their opinion
[1:48:16] your ultimate sso what's your right
[1:48:19] that's your ultimate ultimate that's the
[1:48:22] last word
[1:48:24] and then if he is the word
[1:48:26] then this must be the last word
[1:48:30] this must
[1:48:45] it
[1:48:46] that's what we want to know
[1:48:49] what this word says
[1:48:52] for i am tied to christ
[1:48:55] and christ is the word
[1:48:58] you get
[1:49:13] that is allotted for this day
[1:49:17] the holy spirit is here
[1:49:20] to manifest that portion of the word
[1:49:25] that is
[1:49:40] gonna go on he was the end and then at
[1:49:42] fiend it was the end of the prophecy
[1:49:45] he fulfilled that
[1:49:47] the history they stole the songs
[1:49:49] everything in the old testament
[1:49:51] spoke of him
[1:49:53] it was fulfilled right there
[1:50:07] of the word of god
[1:50:17] i'm going to say it again he was the
[1:50:19] fulfillment of the all the old testament
[1:50:21] prophecies
[1:50:36] jesus fulfilling the old testament jesus
[1:50:40] but there is a group of people
[1:50:43] that fulfill
[1:50:44] all the new testaments
[1:50:50] and the real born-again people of this
[1:50:53] age
[1:50:55] okay who is he talking to
[1:50:57] how many people are born again
[1:51:00] the real born-again people of this age
[1:51:03] that's filled with the holy ghost
[1:51:07] is the thai post of the scripture
[1:51:11] got to be fulfilled in this
[1:51:15] last
[1:51:16] days
[1:51:18] they
[1:51:21] [Applause]
[1:51:32] [Applause]
[1:51:46] because
[1:51:58] that holds you i'll go
[1:52:07] i heard all the testimonies of your hard
[1:52:09] times that you had
[1:52:13] did you hold on to your religion during
[1:52:15] those times
[1:52:19] no
[1:52:20] no
[1:52:21] by religion
[1:52:26] [Applause]
[1:52:28] i want to say it again i'm going to say
[1:52:30] it again i can hold on
[1:52:34] a hard time
[1:52:36] but the scripture that pertained to me
[1:52:41] held on to me
[1:53:39] i can't go on i feel so condemned
[1:53:41] because of what i used to do and what i
[1:53:42] did
[1:53:45] the scripture is not tied to you yet
[1:53:48] it's just an opinion to you
[1:53:52] but when the scripture comes
[1:53:55] upon the waters
[1:53:59] and it comes now it's looking for a
[1:54:01] place
[1:54:02] he's looking for a type
[1:54:04] and when it reminds the person
[1:54:20] those that
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:55:02] and that is what
[1:55:15] that is the showdown today
[1:55:18] when we see this i say wow
[1:55:21] the bible says mendo
[1:55:23] love your enemies
[1:55:25] i want to know if that word has attached
[1:55:27] itself to anybody
[1:55:30] come
[1:57:07] [Applause]
[1:58:32] the world
[1:58:46] the more you become the word
[1:58:50] i want to end with this and there's so
[1:58:51] much more i got to just skip a lot of
[1:58:53] this but my time is gone
[1:58:55] [Music]
[1:58:56] what people have missed
[1:58:59] in that in in when they speak about the
[1:59:01] absolutely
[1:59:02] absolutely the word
[1:59:04] as a person
[1:59:06] not a doctrine
[1:59:09] it is the person
[1:59:11] the new birth that's what it is
[1:59:14] it is the person
[1:59:53] he said that it's been the holy ghost
[1:59:55] this whole time that has been leading
[2:00:10] what
[2:00:22] he recognizes the part that pertains to
[2:00:24] this
[2:00:50] just so you can say that
[2:01:05] recognizing the absolute absolutely
[2:01:08] recognizing what i need
[2:01:10] you recognize what you need
[2:01:15] it is the showdown
[2:01:17] i end with this
[2:01:19] other world would you come to the piano
[2:01:21] this musician
[2:01:23] all that the prophets have spoken
[2:01:26] was not just about words
[2:01:29] but all they spoke of was
[2:01:31] the person
[2:01:33] and the same lord jesus
[2:02:01] it's hard for me to leave a lot these
[2:02:02] some of these things out because it
[2:02:04] really solidifies everything
[2:02:11] says in the exposition
[2:02:14] page
[2:02:16] the last day messenger
[2:02:30] pointed out
[2:02:57] because we cannot
[2:02:59] get to that point
[2:03:03] the showdown has to have already
[2:03:05] happened
[2:03:10] and i want to just
[2:03:12] end with this
[2:03:21] and
[2:03:22] in this dream i was i don't remember it
[2:03:24] was night time
[2:03:43] i remember going to the door and
[2:03:45] and i opened the door
[2:03:48] and

[2:03:54] and
[2:04:04] i stopped because as i look up i see the

[2:05:04] coming forth then
[2:05:07] and i knew the resurrection was on
