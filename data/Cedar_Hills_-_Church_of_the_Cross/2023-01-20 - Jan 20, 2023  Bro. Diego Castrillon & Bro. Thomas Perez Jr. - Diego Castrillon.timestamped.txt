[27:55] bring this word
[27:57] and Lord now you've brought it before us
[28:01] and we rest yes
[28:04] that that same inspiration

[28:24] that this be done in the name of the
[28:26] Lord Jesus
[28:28] Como please take your seats and be
[28:31] comfortable
[28:34] I want for you to follow me on this
[28:37] journey
[28:43] what the prophet Ezekiel is
[28:47] trying to show us
[28:50] how God
[28:53] the word says Jehovah
[28:56] he took me in a vision
[28:59] and he took me in between the Heaven and
[29:02] the Earth
[29:04] and while this took place
[29:07] the word of God came to me
[29:11] and he said Son of Man
[29:15] see is thou not this is
[29:28] why do you not speak
[29:31] why don't you see it
[29:34] the Abominations
[29:38] that the house of Israel are doing
[29:45] and Jehovah said to the prophet
[29:49] imira
[29:54] looks
[29:56] majores because you're gonna see worse
[29:59] Abominations
[30:01] and the prophet Ezekiel said
[30:05] that he was taken to a place
[30:09] that there was a hole in the wall
[30:13] where he could see
[30:17] how the Elders
[30:20] of the House of Israel
[30:25] had found themselves with incense yes
[30:31] and we're doing abominable or horrible
[30:34] things
[30:39] was that they said that Jehovah did not
[30:42] saying Jehovah was no longer on the
[30:46] Earth
[30:48] and the prophet says okay
[30:52] and the Lord took me again
[30:55] and he said look to the
[30:58] Easter because they hadn't finished
[31:04] there's things even worse than this
[31:07] the women
[31:11] they were
[31:14] singing to tamus
[31:17] amen propheta
[31:22] propheteers
[31:25] do you not fear Ezekiel
[31:28] images
[31:31] and the Lord showed me the prophet
[31:34] Ezekiel said
[31:37] he took me inside
[31:41] between the temple between the entrance
[31:44] and the
[31:45] pulpitones and he saw 20 and five
[31:48] minutes
[31:49] with their back
[32:01] worshiping the Sun
[32:06] what a word
[32:09] for a people yes
[32:17] this word did not come to it
[32:22] this prophecy didn't come to people that
[32:24] didn't know God
[32:29] this this word did not come to people
[32:31] that never knew the word
[32:34] this prophecy came to a people okay
[32:39] that was called through Moses
[32:44] the first thing that Moses knew of God
[32:50] was that God told him Moses
[32:55] because the place that you're at is Holy
[32:58] Ground
[32:59] Santo what did that Holy Ground do
[33:03] Santo God made it holy foreign
[34:17] I want you to catch these words
[34:21] I don't know I didn't call you
[34:26] I can't heal you
[35:18] a people that should be serving God
[35:23] actually
[35:24] cuando cuando say yes God when Isaiah
[35:31] he had the vision
[35:35] when it says in Isaiah chapter six
[35:44] when I was taken and I saw God on his
[35:47] throne foreign
[36:44] you
[36:48] need to turn your families
[36:57] God demands Holiness
[37:01] this happened back there
[37:04] and tonight
[37:06] the lord gave me a vision Brothers
[37:10] I could see such a beautiful house
[37:13] that's a real modern house
[37:16] and I said wow what a beautiful
[37:20] Perfecto everything looked just perfect
[37:24] but there was something that didn't fit
[37:26] in the scene
[37:32] there was Weeds that were growing up all
[37:34] around the outside of this house
[37:37] and I could see more of the house
[37:41] because the because the weeds weren't
[37:43] there
[37:44] and you know what the worst part was
[37:49] they were greens
[37:55] there was something that was feeding
[37:58] now I ask you tonight
[38:01] God told the prophet Ezekiel
[38:05] I will judge
[38:08] I won't hear you
[38:11] I'm gonna chase you yes Here We Are
[38:15] Tonight
[38:17] with needs and petitions
[38:21] but if God didn't have mercy back there
[38:47] oh yeah

[38:54] are we better than the people of Israel
[38:56] no sir yes God no says
[39:10] here we're not speakers
[39:26] to see all the things that people do
[39:29] high hidden
[39:31] all these weeds
[39:38] type that there's so much resentment in
[39:40] the people of God
[39:43] a people were called to have joy
[39:46] preference
[39:47] they'd rather be bitter
[40:12] [Music]
