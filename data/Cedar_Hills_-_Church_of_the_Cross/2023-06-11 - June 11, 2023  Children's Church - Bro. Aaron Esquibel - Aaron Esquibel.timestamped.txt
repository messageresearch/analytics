[37:48] but I don't want to give any more out
[37:51] I gotta have a good balance
[37:54] who already has something
[37:57] it's a softball but it's actually hard
[38:03] and at the very bottom which it
[38:05] shouldn't have been
[38:07] is
[38:10] a Bible
[38:13] it should be the most valued possession
[38:16] but if you notice I had it laying at the
[38:18] bottom of my chest
[38:20] what's wrong with that picture
[38:23] anybody
[38:33] it's not right to put this before put
[38:36] everything else before the Bible amen
[38:38] the word of God should be first in our
[38:41] heart
[38:42] and that's what I did not do
[38:46] so I'm going to tell you all a little
[38:47] story
[38:52] I'm still learning to this day
[38:55] how to keep me sales and going
[38:58] but you see
[39:00] unlike you children
[39:04] I didn't grow up with a mother and a
[39:06] father
[39:07] nobody loved me nobody took care of me
[39:11] if I wanted something I had to steal it
[39:14] I had to take it by force
[39:18] if I needed to eat for the day I'd go to
[39:21] the market I would steal
[39:23] I would fight for everything
[39:26] so one day I was walking in a field
[39:30] and I saw a beautiful flower there on
[39:32] the ground
[39:34] so me picked it up
[39:37] and I was looking at this flower
[39:40] and I was looking it was so radiant so
[39:43] beautiful
[39:45] and all of a suddenly
[39:49] the flower sneezed in my face
[39:53] flowers aren't supposed to do that
[39:56] one might think
[39:58] that wasn't in my right mind
[40:01] but I was
[40:03] so hajui
[40:04] he's back onto the flower
[40:07] I said take that flower
[40:11] and all of a sudden the flowers started
[40:13] talking
[40:15] you might think I'm crazy and I am
[40:19] but that flower was the first friend he
[40:22] ever made
[40:24] he's a bluff
[40:26] he's not coming back he's thornless we
[40:29] have the sword
[40:31] so let's get a lesson going
[40:34] so I had this flower
[40:36] and this flower was my best friend
[40:39] the flower would talk to me I got a
[40:42] relationship with the flower
[40:44] and one day the flower tells me
[40:47] you know what Captain Jack I wasn't a
[40:49] captain then
[40:52] ask me anything you want
[40:55] and it's yours
[40:57] and I said well
[41:00] get a new ship
[41:02] I could ask for food
[41:05] whatever me heart desire
[41:09] I could have asked for gold and that's
[41:11] what I asked for
[41:13] you all guessed
[41:15] I asked for gold
[41:18] and I said you know what I felt really
[41:20] inspired
[41:21] and there was a great mountain in front
[41:24] of me
[41:24] and I said you know what flower
[41:27] fill that mountain with gold
[41:30] and when we get to the top
[41:32] I want to walk in and see much gold all
[41:35] the rich
[41:37] and the flower said very well
[41:40] you can have what you wish
[41:42] under one condition
[41:44] you must take me everywhere with you
[41:47] for the moment you leave me behind
[41:50] your riches or nothing
[41:52] so I said fair enough you're my friend
[41:54] I'll never leave
[41:56] here my flower
[41:58] and so we walked up the mountain that
[42:00] day I'll never forget
[42:02] and as we got to the top
[42:05] there was a big mouth of a cave
[42:08] and we walk in
[42:10] and it was so dark
[42:12] put me flower lit away as if it was
[42:14] sunlight
[42:16] and we turned our sharp corner
[42:18] and behold my eyes saw the greatest
[42:20] treasure I'd ever seen mountains of Gold
[42:24] Gems rubies any precious stone your
[42:27] heart could imagine
[42:30] so what I did is I got my beautiful
[42:31] flower
[42:33] and I was so caught up in the gold
[42:36] that I threw my flower on the ground
[42:39] hey
[42:40] and I began to look
[42:42] and I began to stuff my pockets
[42:45] as quick as I could with Ruby's Jewels
[42:48] gold
[42:50] and I thought as soon as I get to town
[42:52] all me mates will know that I'm a rich
[42:55] man
[42:56] and I began to stuff every pocket I had
[43:00] in my pocket for huge full of golden
[43:03] jewels
[43:04] and I was going to run out of the cave
[43:06] to go tell all the people in the village
[43:07] what I had found
[43:10] and I Heard a Voice say wait
[43:12] you're forgetting the most poor thing
[43:15] oh
[43:16] damn
[43:18] I'm forgetting proof that I was here at
[43:21] the Bible
[43:22] I didn't care about the Bible
[43:24] so I grabbed a big piece of stone so I
[43:27] could show the people that I was really
[43:28] there
[43:29] that this place did exist
[43:33] and I put it on me back and I was going
[43:35] out the cave again and once more I heard
[43:37] a little voice so thanks so quiet
[43:42] wait
[43:43] you're forgetful thing
[43:46] and I look back
[43:48] and it was the flower
[43:50] I said I don't need that no more
[43:52] I'll leave it here I'll come back for it
[43:55] later
[43:56] and as soon as I left the cave
[43:58] the mountain crumble
[44:01] and I looked back and it did not exist
[44:04] anymore
[44:06] and I realized
[44:08] I left the most important thing in the
[44:10] cave and it was gone forever
[44:20] I left my flower
[44:23] and that's where the power lied was in
[44:25] my flower
[44:27] so I had all the riches but it did not
[44:29] matter
[44:30] because I could no longer prove
[44:34] that the power
[44:35] I could have gone a million more times
[44:37] back to that mountain been very
[44:39] successful
[44:41] had lost the show
[44:44] but I didn't keep my part of the deal
[44:47] and therefore I was a broke man
[44:50] all these riches mean nothing to me
[44:55] now I want you to ask yourself today
[44:58] what
[45:01] yes
[45:13] she loves gold
[45:18] good
[45:21] all right back on task
[45:27] yeah that's a chair
[45:30] the chair has gold I know I talked to
[45:32] flowers
[45:34] go ahead
[45:40] and you see
[45:44] you've got to ask yourself today
[45:46] what might my flower be
[45:49] what is that little voice that tells me
[45:51] within my heart
[45:53] I shouldn't do this
[45:55] you shouldn't talk back to your parents
[45:57] you shouldn't be mean to other children
[46:00] you shouldn't lie cheat and steal
[46:04] there's a little voice in each one of
[46:06] you at heart
[46:07] that tells you what's right and what's
[46:10] wrong
[46:11] but the moment you silence that voice
[46:13] like I did
[46:15] that's when all the power leaves you
[46:18] that's when you got to find your way
[46:20] back to the Lord
[46:24] and if my friends upstairs would play a
[46:26] little clip
[46:28] I want you to listen very closely
[46:31] to what the prophet has to say
[46:35] there's nobody can try to do anything
[46:38] your kids would never be able to do
[46:41] anything wrong that you're being raised
[46:42] the way you are unless you feel
[46:45] something tell you not to do it
[46:47] I don't never steal that voice that's
[46:51] one and always remember accept that
[46:54] voice it said
[46:56] follow me
[46:58] and you'll always come out right
[47:00] I believe you will I got confidence in
[47:03] you but just always remember
[47:05] and Jesus that voice is alive in the
[47:08] Earth tonight
[47:10] that voice to the life tonight
[47:13] and that's who is speaking tonight
[47:15] he's speaking to your heart
[47:18] don't ever silence that Voice Within
[47:22] your treasure box
[47:23] you see Pirates don't bury their
[47:25] treasure so that they never find it
[47:28] again
[47:29] no we bury our treasure so that's when
[47:31] we need it most
[47:33] we can use the map of God's word
[47:36] and pull out the treasures of his
[47:38] promises
[47:40] if I need healing I can take healing
[47:42] from the treasure box
[47:44] and you might ask how do I put treasure
[47:46] in my box
[47:48] well it's very simple
[47:51] you all recite your Bible verses every
[47:53] week don't you
[47:55] you are adding treasure into your box
[47:58] when you speak to the Lord
[48:00] you are adding treasure into your box
[48:03] when you help all your mates around you
[48:06] you are adding pleasure to your box
[48:09] so that's when you have need of it you
[48:12] simply go in and take what you need
[48:16] well
[48:17] as for me Captain Jack Doe
[48:21] I will continue sailing the Seas
[48:24] working for the captain of capital
