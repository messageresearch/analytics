[53:55] do we see Christ when we look into the
[53:58] mirror
[53:59] do we react better to things or do we
[54:03] still fly off the handles
[54:06] do we find ourselves thinking more on
[54:09] the things of God or the things of the
[54:11] world
[54:13] do you think on how you can help others
[54:18] or is your focus just on yourself
[54:22] am I more available when God wants to
[54:25] use me
[54:27] I don't know let's back up to the wall
[54:30] church and let's see where we were from
[54:33] last year to this year
[54:36] and only you cannot answer the question
[54:39] have I grown any
[54:42] and on and on we can go
[54:45] but I give you these things just to to
[54:48] get you uh to get you to think about
[54:50] it's time that we measure ourselves
[54:55] it's measuring time today
[54:58] and the word is used to measure the
[55:02] worshiper
[55:04] I was thinking the other day
[55:07] I said could it be possible
[55:10] that God could use a Ministry
[55:15] Revival fires around the world foreign
[55:42] [Music]
[55:53] and the problem lies in the fact
[55:58] that people have a hard time leaving
[56:00] their everybody
[56:05] I'm going to say it again we have a hard
[56:08] time leaving our comfort zone
[56:11] we have become soft
[56:14] as church goers we become soft
[56:20] hello are you still with me this morning
[56:23] maybe you don't like what I'm preaching
[56:25] but that's okay
[56:26] we don't get more than what we have we
[56:30] we don't get more than what we have
[56:33] because we have become too comfortable
[56:38] the fire is only comfortable
[56:42] when you're seeing it from a distance
[56:45] and you're being warped by that fire
[56:49] but the day you get into the fire
[56:53] and the Fire gets into you
[56:56] is the day that you are no longer
[56:59] comfortable
[57:01] because there's a purpose why fire comes
[57:06] Revival fires are for that purpose
[57:10] what is the fire what does it do okay
[57:16] it annihilates it kills it destroys and
[57:22] that's what people don't want is
[57:25] because it makes you uncomfortable
[57:28] we talk about the Holy Ghost
[57:32] but we want the fire at a distance
[57:36] the Holy Ghost didn't come to be at a
[57:38] distance from here
[57:41] came to dwell inside of your heart
[57:44] but I heard every unclean thing
[57:50] then why are we so comfortable nowadays
[57:55] fire makes way for a new creation
[58:00] I'm going to say it again church fire
[58:03] makes way for a new creation
[58:06] fire that was re that was started there
[58:09] in Uganda
[58:12] not just for the ugandans
[58:16] the fire is for you
[58:20] that are foreign
[58:30] the only man of William you're not in
[58:33] all the way
[58:34] maybe your leg is sticking out she says
[58:37] maybe your arm or your head is sticking
[58:40] out
[58:42] what time this morning that we get all
[58:44] the way in
[58:46] what's the Lord telling us this morning
[58:49] get out of your comfort zone
[58:52] oh man we're in our Tempur-Pedic beds
[58:59] and the Lord says Ah come and pray come
[59:03] and talk to me a little while
[59:10] wow we're too comfortable
[59:16] hello everybody
[59:19] get out of our comfort zone
[59:22] if you're comfortable with our
[59:24] featherbedness
[59:27] we're too comfortable with our little
[59:30] groups that we hang out with foreign
[59:44] Hallelujah
[59:46] yeah yeah the hunters hang out with the
[59:49] hunters
[59:51] it's our comfort zone
[59:54] but the Lord is stirring the nest
[59:58] telling us get out of your comfort zone
[1:00:02] with having your friends and who you
[1:00:04] like to hang out with we all we all have
[1:00:06] friends
[1:00:07] but when that becomes the very purpose
[1:00:10] of Our Lives
[1:00:15] let's get out of our comfort zone this
[1:00:18] year
[1:00:21] if you want to join me or
[1:00:24] we can't even pray 30 minutes on our
[1:00:27] knees

[1:00:33] knees and you and you think
[1:00:35] is 15 minutes into our prayer

[1:00:42] minutes

[1:01:21] children are crying and they don't feel
[1:01:25] good they're fussy
[1:01:29] our parents didn't ask us if we wanted
[1:01:31] to go to church

[1:01:54] we're going to church
[1:01:57] that's what we do in our homes
[1:02:01] serving the lord is the center of our
[1:02:04] Lives
[1:02:05] we grew up that way we didn't grow up
[1:02:09] comfortable
[1:02:11] we were poor as can be we seem to have
[1:02:15] nothing but we had a passion to serve
[1:02:18] them
[1:02:20] passion to help people that was the
[1:02:23] center of our lives but not no more
[1:02:29] comfortable today no bring them I don't
[1:02:32] know why
[1:02:33] the passion in your children
[1:02:36] you know what it means to serve God all
[1:02:39] the time
[1:02:41] no we are so soft
[1:02:44] oh my goodness Lord help us that's how
[1:02:48] our fire stayed lit I said
[1:02:51] How's your fire this morning
[1:02:54] let's see how your passion is for the
[1:02:57] things of God
[1:02:59] so I'm challenging myself
[1:03:03] as much as I'm challenging you this year
[1:03:06] let's do something for the Lord that we
[1:03:09] have never done before
[1:03:11] anybody got any tasters this morning
[1:03:24] it's time that we shock our system
[1:03:29] all right and choke how many of you ever
[1:03:31] get in the shower and man it's so
[1:03:33] comfortable
[1:03:36] you get there in the shower
[1:03:38] oh man you just you just want to stay
[1:03:41] there
[1:03:44] you want to stay there in the shower you
[1:03:46] don't want to get out
[1:03:48] then somebody in your family says you're
[1:03:50] wasting water
[1:03:52] leave me alone
[1:03:56] but how many of you right before you get
[1:03:58] out do you turn it full cold
[1:04:02] Turn It full black little shock your
[1:04:04] system oh my God
[1:04:08] that's what we need to do this year
[1:04:11] we need to shock our system a little bit
[1:04:18] let's do something that'll take us out
[1:04:21] of our comfort zone
[1:04:23] let us worship like we have never
[1:04:26] worshiped
[1:04:29] if you're used to getting up late
[1:04:34] get up a little earlier
[1:04:39] [Applause]
[1:04:40] seek the Lord
[1:04:44] see if you don't start hearing from God
[1:04:47] I'm not talking about doing something
[1:04:50] one time
[1:04:52] going back to our old selves our old
[1:04:55] habits
[1:04:57] talking about a new creation being
[1:05:00] formed inside of us
[1:05:03] a new creation that's coming forth
[1:05:08] I'm talking about a new creation being
[1:05:11] formed in us
[1:05:13] this body can't handle it no more
[1:05:18] sooner or later this body is gonna have
[1:05:20] to release it
[1:05:24] any takers
[1:05:27] shock us to our core
[1:05:31] just about dying just to die
[1:05:35] we're talking about dying to live
[1:05:38] because if the old creation
[1:05:41] the old nature doesn't die
[1:05:44] that is always your default settings
[1:05:50] and that's the one that always says
[1:05:54] well I'm only human when
[1:05:58] maybe you should find your Eternal part
[1:06:02] you don't have to always say I'm only
[1:06:04] human understanding
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:10] I'll stop that's enough today
[1:06:13] so that's enough today we'll go
[1:06:17] a new creature in Christ Jesus Christ
[1:06:21] says I don't know that old man anymore
[1:06:26] old man is crucified with
[1:06:30] Christopher these things are
[1:06:51] not just as a repackaged Caleb or
[1:06:55] whoever your name whatever your name is
[1:06:59] no that guy will always pop his head up
[1:07:04] we want to enter this new year as a new
[1:07:07] creation
[1:07:16] all right then let's let's take this
[1:07:19] you want to shout in church shout
[1:07:22] character systems
[1:07:44] we're gonna shock our system or not
[1:07:50] you feel like running why don't you run
[1:07:53] I'm embarrassed the fire never gets
[1:07:57] embarrassed
[1:07:59] Let the Fire do what it's supposed to
[1:08:01] and it don't get embarrassed
[1:08:03] hello everybody
[1:08:05] you want to shout shout you want to cry
[1:08:08] cry
[1:08:12] but it's all about getting out of our
[1:08:15] comfort zone
[1:08:17] the heroes of the faith
[1:08:21] they didn't have it comfortable
[1:08:26] no son or daughter of God have it
[1:08:29] comfortable
[1:08:31] they were fed to the Lions the Bible
[1:08:34] says
[1:08:35] they were tortured foreign
[1:09:01] the world was not deserving of such
[1:09:04] people
[1:09:06] they were the people
[1:09:08] whom the world could never measure such
[1:09:12] a character
[1:09:14] how do you measure that how do you
[1:09:18] measure someone that has given their all
[1:09:20] to the Lord
[1:09:22] no matter what they go through
[1:09:25] raise their hands and say blessed be the
[1:09:28] name of the Lord
[1:09:30] have a measuring
[1:09:33] sticks
[1:09:36] all they can do is call you weird
[1:09:41] they're weird the world was not worthy
[1:09:46] but because they got out of their
[1:09:49] Comforts
[1:09:50] the Bible says they subdued kingdoms
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:10:34] the raising of our deaths
[1:10:39] Hallelujah
[1:10:54] get excited here
[1:10:57] we're so soft
[1:10:59] when we don't get what we want
[1:11:03] God doesn't love me no more yeah
[1:11:06] we become weak in our mind and in our
[1:11:09] spirit
[1:11:14] to Worship the Lord in spirit and Truth
[1:11:18] people don't even know what being in the
[1:11:22] spirit is anymore
[1:11:24] they don't even know what truth is
[1:11:27] what has to happen
[1:11:30] we Must Die daily
[1:11:33] let there be a change of Hearts
[1:11:37] a change of Desire
[1:11:40] once again Revelations 11 1 says there
[1:11:43] was given me a read
[1:11:46] like this
[1:11:49] measure the temple and measure the altar
[1:11:53] measure the worship foreign
[1:12:34] measure the temple measure the altar
[1:12:38] measure the worshipers
[1:12:41] watch this now
[1:12:43] there was a story that brother Morton
[1:12:46] told me
[1:12:47] thank you for that brother Morton
[1:12:50] he said a certain politician from Norway
[1:12:53] Politico de Norway had come to the
[1:12:56] United States
[1:12:58] and was invited to a presidential
[1:13:01] breakfast
[1:13:03] with then it was President Clinton
[1:13:07] during the time that he was being
[1:13:09] impeached
[1:13:12] and everyone in the room was told
[1:13:16] as the president entered
[1:13:20] would you all stand as the president
[1:13:23] comes in
[1:13:25] he said that there was a certain woman
[1:13:27] that was there yeah
[1:13:29] she said I will not stand
[1:13:33] I'm ashamed of this President
[1:13:36] as the president entered
[1:13:39] everyone stood except for that woman
[1:13:43] he said that
[1:13:46] Billy Graham got up
[1:13:48] Billy Graham he was asked to pray
[1:13:52] and he began his prayer like this
[1:13:56] Lord senor
[1:13:58] we are all sinners
[1:14:04] afterwards the woman
[1:14:06] that didn't stand sir this is
[1:14:09] still ashamed of the president
[1:14:13] but now I'm more ashamed of myself
[1:14:19] because we forget at many times foreign
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:56] she hadn't grown like she had thought
[1:14:58] she had no idea maybe that's what we
[1:15:01] should do when someone starts talking
[1:15:02] about someone else
[1:15:05] nobody should get out of their comfort
[1:15:07] zone
[1:15:11] Lord we are all sinners
[1:15:14] oh that would put everything back in
[1:15:16] check right away
[1:15:22] because you all know you are talking
[1:15:25] about one or the other
[1:15:27] shame I have to even talk about these
[1:15:29] things
[1:15:30] but you all know many times you leave
[1:15:33] the conversation it's like I should have
[1:15:35] said
[1:15:38] I should have stood up and
[1:15:41] um
[1:15:47] because they probably won't invite you
[1:15:49] into their little group
[1:15:57] well there there they put out the fire
[1:16:00] they put out the party
[1:16:04] no because you don't like what is being
[1:16:07] told
[1:16:09] we don't fit in the groups
[1:16:13] come on yeah
[1:16:16] You're Gonna Love Me Or Hate Me when
[1:16:18] it's all said
[1:16:19] the true worshiper
[1:16:22] time to grow up in Christ
[1:16:24] brother I have so many issues yeah
[1:16:32] she will no matter if it's your health
[1:16:34] or finances or Spirits
[1:16:36] we all deal with issues
[1:16:39] we go through rough times
[1:16:42] and we say brother I feel like my back's
[1:16:46] up against the wallsendo
[1:16:53] what's the problem is it problema uh I I
[1:16:56] I don't understand your backs up against
[1:16:59] the walls
[1:17:01] how he measures
[1:17:03] he measures You by how you handle the
[1:17:07] situation
[1:17:13] but if we still handle it the same way
[1:17:19] we're still we're here
[1:17:21] we didn't grow no Christmas so God sends
[1:17:24] another test
[1:17:25] and we handle it the same way
[1:17:33] oh
[1:17:37] let's see how we started the year
[1:17:40] people say oh it's been a bad year
[1:17:42] already yeah
[1:17:45] your back's up against the wall
[1:17:48] the Lord spoke and says it's going to be
[1:17:51] a rough one
[1:17:54] when the hardships
[1:17:57] we can go on a big old list of what is
[1:17:59] going on right now in the church
[1:18:04] right
[1:18:06] but in the midst of it all
[1:18:08] I see a perfect worship coming
[1:18:13] oh look church if I could just if I I
[1:18:16] tell you what I what the Lord is doing
[1:18:19] and what he's showing is so amazing
[1:18:24] I see a people still worshiping God
[1:18:28] I see people that are that are going
[1:18:31] through a hardship right now
[1:18:34] and still in the middle of it all
[1:18:36] they're shaking themselves
[1:18:39] they've been shook to the course
[1:18:43] brother in the midst of this
[1:18:46] feel that peace in the midst of it
[1:19:01] [Applause]
[1:19:12] shut up
[1:19:14] I hear others say nevertheless not my
[1:19:17] will but thine be done
[1:19:21] perfect worship
[1:19:24] I heard something the other day
[1:19:28] that
[1:19:30] made me cry
[1:19:33] it hit me so it just hit me just right
[1:19:38] you know usually if you get in an
[1:19:41] accident
[1:19:42] anybody ever been in an accident
[1:19:46] you ever go by the place where you had
[1:19:49] the accident
[1:19:54] that's rough
[1:19:57] you see those times in or the place and
[1:19:59] you and it just you cringe
[1:20:03] but I heard something the other day that
[1:20:05] got me
[1:20:08] a few months ago my wife was in an
[1:20:11] accident
[1:20:15] and the other day
[1:20:17] Abby was giving me a ride to pick up my
[1:20:20] vehicle
[1:20:22] and Hadley was with us
[1:20:26] and as we passed the intersection where
[1:20:28] they had had the accident
[1:20:32] I just heard adley from the back seat
[1:20:36] that's the place
[1:20:39] that Jesus protected me Jesus
[1:20:44] [Music]
[1:20:45] [Applause]
[1:21:32] and when the chief priests and the
[1:21:35] scribes saw the wonderful things that he
[1:21:38] did
[1:21:39] and the children crying in the temple
[1:21:42] and saying Hosanna to the son of David
[1:21:45] they were so displeased
[1:21:50] I'm just going to read it in English to
[1:21:51] save time you then Spanish can read
[1:21:53] verse 16. and said unto him here is thou
[1:21:57] what these say
[1:21:59] and Jesus saith unto them yea
[1:22:02] have you never read that out of the
[1:22:05] mouth of babes and sucklings thou has
[1:22:09] perfected praise
[1:22:12] church when the real true worship
[1:22:15] is being given to God
[1:22:18] it's the religious people
[1:22:21] are so displaced this this think they're
[1:22:26] better than everyone else
[1:22:30] why because they can give praise to God
[1:22:32] in the middle of adversity
[1:22:35] because they can give praise to God when
[1:22:37] their backs up against the walls
[1:22:40] all satan is trying to do is steal the
[1:22:43] worship
[1:22:46] oh I've had a wonderful day you might as
[1:22:48] well say praise the devil
[1:22:51] see this is
[1:22:54] feeling good today
[1:23:01] hello everybody I'm talking about true
[1:23:03] worshipers
[1:23:05] oh I'm having a rough time
[1:23:09] oh but when we can say
[1:23:12] this is the day it's the time
[1:23:18] things could have gone way out of hand
[1:23:20] but he protected
[1:23:24] it's hard to do is
[1:23:27] it's not an easy thing let's not go fast
[1:23:29] you don't do it from your mouth
[1:23:31] because from your mouth you say
[1:23:33] sometimes why
[1:23:36] Lords of your heart
[1:23:38] depths of a True Believer
[1:23:41] that is Blessed Be Your holy name
[1:23:46] out of the mouth of babes thou has
[1:23:49] perfected the praise
[1:23:52] the problem then comes to this is that
[1:23:56] we use
[1:23:58] certain measuring stick for ourselves
[1:24:02] we use a different measuring stick for
[1:24:05] our children
[1:24:11] okay here's here's here's here's the dad
[1:24:14] in the family ah blankety blank blank
[1:24:16] blank
[1:24:19] then goes to his children and say don't
[1:24:22] talk like that okay
[1:24:27] you serious
[1:24:30] one measuring stick for you it's okay to
[1:24:32] do it
[1:24:39] we use a different measuring stick for
[1:24:41] the people in the church
[1:24:44] we use a different measuring stick for
[1:24:46] the world
[1:24:47] and after a while
[1:24:50] we have a lot of measuring sticks
[1:24:53] we measure everyone in the church
[1:24:57] by what we think
[1:25:03] but sometimes we don't even have a right
[1:25:06] measuring stick
[1:25:08] so we measure someone by what somebody
[1:25:11] else says
[1:25:16] there's a lot of measuring sticks we
[1:25:19] measure by the culture and Society we
[1:25:21] live in
[1:25:23] we measure by our family upbringings
[1:25:25] foreign
[1:25:54] having a lot of measuring sticks
[1:25:57] Abomination to God
[1:25:59] we're using so many different sticks
[1:26:04] believe me I got to preach this to
[1:26:06] myself first
[1:26:07] this is the biggest problem that people
[1:26:10] have is
[1:26:11] they're worried what everybody else is
[1:26:14] saying and thinks about them
[1:26:18] they're worried about every measuring
[1:26:20] stick
[1:26:22] go to the scripture real quick and let's
[1:26:24] find out
[1:26:26] the Bible says about having a lot of
[1:26:28] measuring sticks
[1:26:31] Deuteronomy 25 14 through 16.
[1:26:36] this is a commandment
[1:26:38] s shall not have in thine house divers
[1:26:43] measures
[1:26:48] a great small
[1:26:52] Thou shalt not have in your house divers
[1:26:54] measures
[1:27:03] no no no
[1:27:06] maybe I'll use this one
[1:27:07] we use a smaller measuring stick
[1:27:12] oh we feel like giants huh
[1:27:19] yes or yes you use a small measuring
[1:27:23] stick
[1:27:25] and then for everybody else
[1:27:30] yeah yeah yeah I knew it this is
[1:27:34] hello everybody
[1:27:36] hello hola todos Thou shalt not
[1:27:40] have in thine house
[1:27:42] diver's measures
[1:27:47] if you're going to measure the temple if
[1:27:50] you're going to measure the altar if
[1:27:52] you're going to measure the worshiper
[1:27:54] a measuring stick must be used
[1:27:58] but Thou shalt have verse 15. but Thou
[1:28:03] shalt have a perfect
[1:28:04] have
[1:28:16] that thy days may be lengthened in the
[1:28:19] land which the Lord thy God giveth him
[1:28:23] for all that do such things
[1:28:26] and all that do unrighteously are an
[1:28:29] Abomination unto the
[1:28:36] Lord's weights
[1:28:45] both of them are like Abominations
[1:28:52] I've got a lot of money in the bank now
[1:28:55] I got a nice house nice car
[1:28:59] God is really blessing me
[1:29:04] wrong measuring stickers

[1:29:31] if you don't dress and act like me wrong
[1:29:33] wrong
[1:29:37] using the wrong measuring sticks
[1:29:40] it's time to throw out all the measuring
[1:29:43] sticks of our house
[1:29:46] and use one measuring stick
[1:29:50] that is the word of God it is the
[1:29:54] message of the hours you want to see if
[1:29:56] you've grown or not
[1:29:58] oh God at his word
[1:30:00] message that has been brought to us say
[1:30:07] foreign
[1:30:15] listen to this
[1:30:18] Ephesians 4 13.
[1:30:20] till we all come
[1:30:23] in the unity of the faith
[1:30:26] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:30:30] unto a perfect man
[1:30:32] unto the measure of the stature
[1:30:37] fullness of Christ brother Branham says
[1:30:42] in the message perseverance
[1:30:44] do you believe that the church is
[1:30:47] shaping into conditions
[1:30:51] Luther had a wide broad way
[1:30:58] it's hot up here Luther had a wide broad
[1:31:02] way
[1:31:03] just accept Christ I said Crystal just
[1:31:06] shall live by faith
[1:31:18] too tall
[1:31:20] let me see what I can see
[1:31:22] Luther had a measuring
[1:31:26] there we go
[1:31:28] there we go hey start let's go on this
[1:31:31] side so everybody can see
[1:31:33] Luther had
[1:31:35] oh
[1:31:37] see
[1:31:38] hey
[1:31:46] hello
[1:31:48] there okay we're back on
[1:31:52] you didn't like that one uh okay
[1:31:55] that's okay
[1:31:56] we're gonna we're gonna sit Luther had a
[1:31:59] measuring
[1:32:01] the just shall live
[1:32:03] and those that stayed with that
[1:32:06] as far as they got hasta you know
[1:32:09] but if the lutherans would have kept
[1:32:11] going
[1:32:13] the measuring stick was was raisedia
[1:32:21] oh we're getting to something here
[1:32:23] if he would if they would have kept
[1:32:26] going
[1:32:27] they would have got to the where the
[1:32:29] Pentecostals were understands
[1:32:33] oh yeah see
[1:32:35] and if the Pentecostals would have kept
[1:32:37] going
[1:32:39] they would have come to the message of
[1:32:41] the hours
[1:32:43] which is the ultimate the ultimate
[1:32:47] measuring steps we're going to get to
[1:32:49] something here now watch what he says
[1:32:53] come more in the minority
[1:32:56] then on down it talks about the the the
[1:33:00] methodism and the Pentecostals
[1:33:04] he said but you see it was God's program
[1:33:08] the Holy Spirit hones it into that
[1:33:11] condition
[1:33:12] now watch he says now to the life in the
[1:33:17] body
[1:33:18] is a Vindication of the Rapture
[1:33:21] that the Rapture is at hand
[1:33:24] when you see the headship
[1:33:29] and the body
[1:33:31] becoming one okay in the fullness of the
[1:33:35] measure of his manifestations
[1:33:40] that shows that the body is about ready
[1:33:42] to be received to the headshots
[1:33:47] now I'm going to turn a corner now
[1:33:50] about 15 minutes is that okay
[1:33:52] because we're going to get something
[1:33:54] good right now here we go
[1:33:56] let's then turn to Ezekiel oh Uncle Juan
[1:34:00] loves Ezekiel
[1:34:04] 47.
[1:34:10] afterward he brought me again unto the
[1:34:13] door of the house
[1:34:24] and behold Waters issued out from under
[1:34:28] the threshold of the house eastwards
[1:34:33] for the Forefront of the house stood
[1:34:35] toward the east
[1:34:40] and the waters came down from under the
[1:34:42] right side of the house at the south
[1:34:44] side of the altar is
[1:34:48] I'm gonna go to verse three and when the
[1:34:52] man
[1:34:52] that had the line in his hand
[1:34:57] we could stay there for a long time
[1:35:01] but the man that had the line in his
[1:35:04] hands
[1:35:05] he had the measuring stick immense
[1:35:10] oh I like that he went forth Eastward
[1:35:14] yes
[1:35:15] didn't he go Eastward to preach the
[1:35:18] seals
[1:35:19] what was he doing taking the line
[1:35:23] this is something good coming up
[1:35:27] and he measured a thousand cubits imidio
[1:35:34] and he brought me through the waters
[1:35:38] the waters
[1:35:40] were
[1:35:43] to the ankles
[1:35:47] got that okay he's taking him the man
[1:35:51] with a line he's taking us
[1:35:55] the just shall live by faith that's
[1:35:59] where it started the bride should be on
[1:36:01] to grow again
[1:36:03] the people stepped into the waters
[1:36:06] they were Justified they were happy
[1:36:09] there yes
[1:36:11] praise God I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:36:15] justification
[1:36:17] this is good yes how many like when you
[1:36:21] go someplace and you go to the ocean and
[1:36:22] you just put your feet in the water
[1:36:27] oh this is nice
[1:36:30] and then all of a sudden
[1:36:32] the problem happens we get comfortable
[1:36:36] there
[1:36:37] they say
[1:36:39] watch what he says piggy say look at
[1:36:41] this day and then he measured a thousand
[1:36:44] and brought me through the waters
[1:36:46] the waters were to the knees
[1:36:51] again he measured a thousand and brought
[1:36:54] me through the waters
[1:36:55] they were to the loins
[1:36:59] and afterwards he measured a thousand
[1:37:03] and it was a river yeah that I could not
[1:37:07] pass over
[1:37:09] for the waters were risen
[1:37:12] Waters to swim
[1:37:15] a river that could not be passed
[1:37:21] how deep was that River
[1:37:24] doesn't tell us how deep
[1:37:27] this is the Crux of the message now
[1:37:30] tell us how deep no no this is because
[1:37:34] how deep is the dependent on you and me
[1:37:39] watch why I say this this man with the
[1:37:44] line in his hands
[1:37:46] is measuring distance
[1:37:49] he's taking us from here to there it's
[1:37:53] an exodus from here to there that's what
[1:37:56] the message has done
[1:37:58] it is it is stretching the lines
[1:38:02] you know how to follow
[1:38:06] now just just so you have this
[1:38:09] information
[1:38:10] he's going in increments of a thousand
[1:38:12] cubits
[1:38:14] and in today's
[1:38:16] measurements that would be about 1500
[1:38:19] feet
[1:38:21] but in biblical terms
[1:38:25] a mile was
[1:38:27] 2 000 cubits
[1:38:30] this is biblical now
[1:38:32] it was 2 000 cubits so if he took them
[1:38:37] he took Ezekiel one thousand one
[1:38:40] thousand one thousand million one
[1:38:42] thousand million that's four thousand
[1:38:44] cubits
[1:38:46] how much would that be in the Bible
[1:38:48] terms
[1:38:51] two miles that's absolutely
[1:38:54] but notice here now in efficiency in the
[1:38:57] Bible
[1:38:58] under thumbs up
[1:39:01] there was a limit how far you could go
[1:39:04] on the Sabbath
[1:39:06] and you could only go 2 000 cubits
[1:39:11] you could only go
[1:39:13] one mile yeah
[1:39:20] think about this now think about how
[1:39:22] tremendous this is
[1:39:24] but the Bible says in Matthew 5 41.
[1:39:28] let's do this now Matthew 5 41.
[1:39:31] whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile
[1:39:34] two thousand cubits
[1:39:37] go with him Twain
[1:39:41] back
[1:39:42] Hallelujah go with him the two miles
[1:39:46] because in the two miles foreign
[1:40:23] Atlanta
[1:40:25] don't be happy because you've made a few
[1:40:27] a mile or so
[1:40:29] we're called to go all the way
[1:40:32] we're not called just to live
[1:40:34] justification
[1:40:36] or to go to the knees and sanctification
[1:40:42] we are called to go all the way
[1:40:46] a river that cannot be measured
[1:40:50] a river that we can swim
[1:40:54] you got to take off the floaties now
[1:40:57] we have been dallying about little here
[1:41:00] and there
[1:41:01] but it's time to jump in now
[1:41:04] but my feet
[1:41:06] I can't feel the bottom because you're
[1:41:10] swimming now
[1:41:13] whoa walk by faith or defense and not by
[1:41:16] side in Upper Vista walk by faith and
[1:41:19] not by feelings
[1:41:21] watch this now he can say this I was
[1:41:24] looking at this and I said wow wow I see
[1:41:27] the four stages the three stages of
[1:41:29] Grace
[1:41:30] which actually there's a fourth one
[1:41:33] that's the fourth four thousand cubits
[1:41:38] now notice this now Waters were to the
[1:41:41] ankles with Luther
[1:41:43] the knees with Wesley yes
[1:41:47] but now it's become a river that's
[1:41:50] unpassable
[1:41:52] no one can pass over it
[1:41:55] unless you're called to do it
[1:42:01] a people that have been chosen
[1:42:04] because now it is not a portion of the
[1:42:07] word
[1:42:08] now it is the word in its fullness
[1:42:12] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:42:16] seven things
[1:42:17] he shall begin to sound
[1:42:20] the mystery should be over finished
[1:42:24] now it grows from the feet modern events
[1:42:28] made clear by prophecy it grows went all
[1:42:32] the way up to the thighs but now it's in
[1:42:34] the hair
[1:42:35] fixing to go this is manifesting
[1:42:39] manifestado in full
[1:42:42] in full measure the Bride
[1:42:45] As the groom this great river that will
[1:42:49] be flowing from the temple
[1:42:53] isn't just something that's coming
[1:42:56] it's something that's here yeah
[1:43:00] come on church I'm I'm turning the
[1:43:02] corner here
[1:43:03] something that is here
[1:43:06] when I see this watch the compoundness
[1:43:10] of scripture
[1:43:12] oh brother that that Ezekiel 47 is
[1:43:15] talking about the Millennium and so
[1:43:17] forth
[1:43:19] let me tell you what the prophet said
[1:43:21] Ezekiel 47 yes
[1:43:29] he says this is
[1:43:35] am I talking to anybody here
[1:43:37] and the wheat bread is
[1:43:45] broken off by Ezekiel 4.
[1:43:50] Hallelujah I'm gonna say it again
[1:43:56] the power spoken of by Ezekiel 47
[1:44:01] that's the Holy Ghost
[1:44:03] When I See This I see I I praise the
[1:44:07] Lord
[1:44:08] because these Waters that issued out
[1:44:11] foreign
[1:44:59] and there shall be be a great multitude
[1:45:02] of fish
[1:45:03] because these Waters shall come hither
[1:45:08] they shall be healed and everything
[1:45:11] shall live whether wither the river
[1:45:15] cometh
[1:45:17] that's the reason we long to come
[1:45:20] together
[1:45:22] church when we come
[1:45:25] on the body Together
[1:45:27] We come as a group of Believers
[1:45:30] sometimes we come in the door around we
[1:45:33] feel like being here
[1:45:35] we all get tired I get it
[1:45:39] that's all we understand or see
[1:45:43] we're missing out what a true worshiper
[1:45:46] is
[1:45:47] perfect the Bible says not forsaking the
[1:45:51] assembling of ourselves
[1:45:54] Gathering Place
[1:45:57] why is it so important
[1:45:59] because our worship is so much greater
[1:46:03] when we come as a body of Believers
[1:46:08] in the last day this is John 7. in the
[1:46:12] last day
[1:46:13] the great day of peace
[1:46:19] Jesus stood in Christ Jesus
[1:46:22] any man thirst is let him come unto me
[1:46:26] and drink
[1:46:28] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:46:32] has said
[1:46:33] out of his belly the word belly is the
[1:46:37] Matrix the womb out of their womb shall
[1:46:40] flow rivers of Living Waters
[1:46:43] where's the water coming from
[1:46:49] so this is people
[1:46:50] year after year oh I barely made it to
[1:46:54] church
[1:46:55] oh my gosh
[1:46:57] by Tuesday I'm bone dry while Martin
[1:47:00] second
[1:47:02] hello everybody
[1:47:04] Oh by Wednesday hum to forget it I'm
[1:47:08] just dragging I need to recharge
[1:47:11] you don't have the fountain in you
[1:47:15] because I don't need to come so that it
[1:47:17] fills me
[1:47:19] the fountain is from within
[1:47:22] um
[1:47:26] when you receive the holy ghost from The
[1:47:29] Fountains
[1:47:30] then you're not looking everywhere to
[1:47:32] get filled
[1:47:34] oh it flows from within
[1:47:37] a river unreal it cannot be measured
[1:47:41] what is it it's the true worshiper
[1:47:45] oh church I hope that you get this and
[1:47:48] I'm finishing now
[1:47:49] get this now brother will would you come
[1:47:51] to the piano or I will not stop because
[1:47:53] I got a lot still but just come anyways
[1:47:56] let me tell you something
[1:47:59] Fountain gotta be flowing inside of you
[1:48:03] be inside already
[1:48:06] this is why I'm telling you this and I'm
[1:48:10] going to prove it by the scriptures
[1:48:12] when the prophet came when the prophet
[1:48:14] gave us the message
[1:48:16] he gave us a message
[1:48:19] and that message
[1:48:21] measured the distance
[1:48:23] how far we've got to walk
[1:48:25] we have to walk
[1:48:27] and he did a thousand cubits and he's
[1:48:31] inviting
[1:48:32] but don't stay there measured another
[1:48:36] thousand immediately once again the man
[1:48:39] with the line
[1:48:40] measure distance as your distance come
[1:48:43] on now we measure the distance but it's
[1:48:47] up to you and I better stand to me how
[1:48:49] deep we want to go into that River
[1:48:52] because that when it's all said and done
[1:48:55] together as a body
[1:48:58] we can measure the depth of that River
[1:49:02] you say brother can you prove it by the
[1:49:05] scriptures
[1:49:11] Ephesians 3 17 and I'm closing with this
[1:49:14] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[1:49:18] faith
[1:49:18] foreign
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:30] all right
[1:50:31] when I look back there and I see brother
[1:50:34] Jerry and sister Faith
[1:50:37] I start to see depth and peace come on
[1:50:41] Church
[1:50:42] when I look at brother Mandola Mandola
[1:50:45] and they say you got cancer again
[1:50:47] you know what he said God already healed
[1:50:51] me from prostate cancer
[1:50:52] God already healed me from a heart
[1:50:56] attack and he's more than able to heal
[1:50:59] me again
[1:51:00] why do I see I see death
[1:51:04] I see the measurement of the words
[1:51:18] what a measurement is going on
[1:51:22] oh we'll say though you slay me I'll
[1:51:24] Trust you wait until you get in that
[1:51:26] position
[1:51:27] if you still say the same thing yeah
[1:51:31] measure yourself
[1:51:34] we come together
[1:51:36] to see what God has done for him
[1:51:40] brought him from and her from him from
[1:51:42] him
[1:51:45] don't say that and I see the scripture
[1:51:48] being fulfilled we may be able to
[1:51:51] comprehend
[1:51:55] with all the saints what's the breath
[1:51:59] and the length and the depth and the
[1:52:01] heights
[1:52:03] know the love of Christ
[1:52:06] passive knowledge
[1:52:11] with all the fullness of God
[1:52:15] brother Branham says this is
[1:52:20] I don't care I mean I mean lutherans are
[1:52:23] fine Baptists are fine
[1:52:27] all these things all right but let's put
[1:52:30] it right down
[1:52:32] every word of God is true
[1:52:35] God said it's perfect
[1:52:38] whatsoever things you desire
[1:52:42] I believe that's the truth
[1:52:44] says
[1:52:47] let me lay my measuring stick down
[1:52:53] on my soul and spread it across God's
[1:52:58] word
[1:52:59] thank God it's the truth is
[1:53:13] and you'll see things take place
[1:53:17] do you believe Mandola
[1:53:30] are you here
[1:53:32] for the Mando come on up all the all the
[1:53:35] ministers to come
[1:53:39] [Music]
