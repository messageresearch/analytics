[13:38] God bless you good
[13:40] morning brother Judah asked me to share
[13:42] this
[13:45] testimony yesterday when brother Diego
[13:47] was um saying that that was somebody
[13:50] with stomach
[13:55] issues and there it was a sister
[14:00] I was reminded of a text that my mom had
[14:03] sent me uh just the night
[14:09] before and I believe it was a holy
[14:12] spirit for my
[14:15] mom and I happen to be here to stand in
[14:17] her
[14:19] place so that she could receive her
[14:22] healing and the text message it says I
[14:25] have been experiencing the stomach pain
[14:27] for over 30 years believe it or not
[14:33] but sometimes it's unbelievable they
[14:36] have done all kinds of
[14:41] tests and this week I had three doctor's
[14:46] appointments today I had an ultrasound
[14:49] of my abdomen and thank God all my
[14:51] organs are fine supposedly
[15:00] and I had been told before by one of the
[15:02] doctors it's my stomach
[15:07] muscles that got severed in the accident
[15:10] of
[15:12] 1993 she says please pray for me that
[15:15] the devil goes back to hell where he
[15:20] belongs and leave me alone once and for
[15:24] all complete restoration of my stomach
[15:30] so I took a picture of of you all
[15:34] here sorry I didn't have you sign a
[15:36] photo release form or
[15:39] anything I took a picture of brother
[15:41] Diego on the platform and I said um I'm
[15:44] in church in Al Paso we just prayed for
[15:47] your stomach
[15:50] issu she says wow thank you so much the
[15:53] doctor said my cholesterol was high too
[15:54] so keep that in prayer as well

[16:01] mama prayer and then last night I just

[36:00] at and we'll continue some other
[36:05] time this is my 18th message on the
[36:10] parable and this is quite a
[36:13] story The Law of adoption is quite a
[36:18] story it is an Earthly story with a
[36:21] Heavenly
[36:24] meaning and so so we want to put a
[36:26] subtitle the mystery of his
[36:31] will so you ready to
[36:34] go everybody got a good night's
[36:36] rest not going to have nobody fall
[36:39] asleep this is a great event once
[36:43] again Ephesians 1 verse
[36:49] 9-1 when you have it you can
[36:53] sayen having made known
[36:56] unto who
[36:58] who who's
[37:00] us all right now now now you know me I
[37:04] like you talking to your neighbor a lot
[37:06] right so so you got to put your name
[37:09] that's what we heard yesterday you got
[37:10] to put your name
[37:11] there having made known unto
[37:16] Caleb he didn't make this known to
[37:20] everybody put your name one more time
[37:22] having made known unto Caleb the mystery
[37:26] of his will
[37:31] according to his good
[37:34] pleasure which Heath purposed in
[37:40] himself verse
[37:42] 10 that in the dispensation of the
[37:45] fullness of
[37:48] times he might gather together in one
[37:52] all things in
[37:56] Christ both which which are in
[37:59] heaven and which are on
[38:01] earth even in him verse 11
[38:06] here in whom also we have obtained an
[38:12] inheritance how many have obtained an an
[38:15] inheritance I have obtained an
[38:18] inheritance three being
[38:22] predestinated according to the purpose
[38:25] of him
[38:28] who worketh all things after the counsel
[38:31] of his own
[38:35] will Matthew chap 6 9 through 9 and
[38:40] 10 remember it's the mystery of his
[38:44] will how many of you know that God's
[38:46] will is a
[38:49] mystery how many want the will of God in
[38:51] your
[38:52] life I want tell your neighbor I want
[38:55] the will of God in my life
[38:58] but the will of God is a
[39:02] mystery and after this manner therefore
[39:04] pray ye Our Father which art in heaven
[39:07] Hallowed be thy
[39:12] name thy kingdom come thy will be
[39:17] done it on
[39:19] Earth no no no it is in everybody point
[39:22] to
[39:23] yourself thy will be done in earth
[39:29] as it is in
[39:30] heaven there's your Earthly story with a
[39:33] Heavenly
[39:36] meaning may God add His blessings to the
[39:38] reading of his word you may be
[39:43] seated and one of the greatest Earthly
[39:45] stories as I said can be
[39:50] portrayed in understanding the law of
[39:55] adoption the law of ad adoption is more
[39:58] relevant today than it ever has been
[40:01] through
[40:04] time say Amen to that one more time the
[40:08] law of adoption is more relevant
[40:12] today than any other time in the history
[40:15] of
[40:18] mankind when we talk about the will of
[40:20] the
[40:22] father his will was not just to have
[40:25] children
[40:28] we know that that attribute of father he
[40:30] wanted to display
[40:33] it he wanted to become a
[40:36] father but he could not be be a father
[40:39] without having
[40:41] children but that was not the end
[40:46] game that was not the end of his will
[40:48] was just to have
[40:52] children but the greatest part of this
[40:54] law of adoption
[40:58] was for those children to become mature
[41:05] adults hello everybody I want to say it
[41:08] again it wasn't just about having
[41:12] children but it was taking those
[41:14] children so that they could become
[41:19] mature that they could understand his
[41:22] will and that they would want to do his
[41:25] will
[41:27] this is a hard
[41:28] thing because we also have a
[41:33] will it's called self
[41:36] will and we choose many
[41:39] things the problem is with our
[41:42] will is that our will doesn't take
[41:45] nothing else into
[41:49] consideration our will simply looks at
[41:51] what we
[41:53] want it it's it looks at the now and the
[41:58] present but it doesn't take into
[42:03] consideration the past present and
[42:06] future that's our
[42:09] self-will Lord this is what I want Lord
[42:13] do this for me now anybody anybody here
[42:15] guilty of
[42:16] that Lord do this for me and I want this
[42:19] Lord and help me with
[42:21] this let's find out a little bit about
[42:23] this
[42:25] mystery the firstborn of the
[42:29] family son he had great
[42:32] honor and usually received the largest
[42:35] part of the
[42:38] inheritance he was the successor to the
[42:44] patriarch and the other children they
[42:46] respected him and treated him as
[42:51] Soul the word
[42:55] firstborn it simply meant preeminent in
[43:00] status or closest in
[43:05] relationship why even God calls Israel
[43:08] my
[43:11] firstborn he's describing the
[43:14] relationship between him and
[43:18] Israel and any time that he would call
[43:21] somebody my
[43:24] firstborn that's what he's doing he's
[43:26] he's just describing the
[43:30] relationship but it wasn't just the
[43:33] firstborn that God considered as
[43:39] firstborn David was the youngest of all
[43:41] his
[43:43] brothers and yet in the eyes of
[43:46] God he called David my
[43:50] servant I will make him my
[43:54] firstborn you you see because God will
[43:57] is a
[43:59] mystery and not everybody is going to
[44:02] fulfill the the
[44:04] mystery not everybody's going to
[44:07] understand the
[44:08] mystery because not everybody is part of
[44:11] the
[44:13] purpose hello everybody I'm going to say
[44:15] it again not everybody has that
[44:19] purpose so he calls David his
[44:24] firstborn because David was a type of
[44:26] Christ
[44:28] now I'm putting this Foundation real
[44:30] quick because sheesh my time's already
[44:34] wow I'm gonna see if I can pause it
[44:36] every now and
[44:38] then hopefully hopefully brother is not
[44:42] putting it on his
[44:45] too it doesn't
[44:48] match let's go on and that's the way it
[44:50] is with us if we are part of his
[44:54] church and have been born again
[44:57] again who am I talking
[45:00] to okay okay well brother I was not the
[45:04] first born in my
[45:06] family the Bible
[45:08] says that his
[45:11] firstborn watch when we are born
[45:14] again we have been born into this
[45:17] Kingdom we have been born into his
[45:21] church and he calls his church the
[45:24] church of the firstborn
[45:27] all right now we're getting somewhere so
[45:30] when you are part of that
[45:32] church you are part of the
[45:36] firstborn because there's an
[45:39] inheritance that no one else can
[45:42] have no one else receives but you that
[45:45] are part of the Church of the first
[45:48] born we know these things and I'm just
[45:50] going to go through them real
[45:52] quick Galatians the 4th chapter we know
[45:55] about the air right gas
[45:57] you that study the scripture study the
[46:01] message The Heir as long as he is a
[46:05] child he differs nothing from a
[46:08] servant though he be Lord of all but
[46:12] he's under tutors and
[46:15] governors until the time appointed of
[46:18] the
[46:20] father what is this time appointed of
[46:23] the
[46:24] father it is the time of
[46:28] adoption are you with me this is the
[46:31] time
[46:32] appointed the father is
[46:35] waiting like the father can't
[46:39] wait the son comes to
[46:43] maturity so that he can take on of the
[46:47] business and so that the word of the
[46:51] son the same as that of the
[46:55] father why is it
[46:57] because the son doesn't go by his own
[47:00] will the mystery has been revealed to
[47:03] the
[47:05] son and therefore the son will only do
[47:08] what the father shows
[47:11] him adoption is the placing of a
[47:17] son this should be ABCs
[47:20] to tell your neighbor adoption is the
[47:23] placing of a
[47:25] son why is it so important to us
[47:29] today brother Bram says because there
[47:32] was a dispensation of church
[47:36] organization there was a dispensation of
[47:39] the outpouring of the Holy
[47:42] Spirit and so many people stay in those
[47:48] dispensations but now tell your neighbor
[47:52] now now turn to the other side and say
[47:55] now
[47:57] but now is the dispensation of
[48:02] adoption oh I like that this morning not
[48:07] tomorrow not yesterday but now is the
[48:11] dispensation of
[48:14] adoption and all the world has been
[48:17] groaning and waiting for this
[48:21] time no I'm sorry I get a little bit
[48:24] little bit the Lord crazy but I I think
[48:28] I'm supposed to be
[48:29] teaching okay so I got to slow
[48:33] down preach teach combo you want the
[48:38] combo combo I'm not sure if you've
[48:41] noticed this
[48:42] now I'm sure many have
[48:46] before I I want to show you something
[48:48] right
[48:49] now that the life of
[48:53] Jesus was written perfectly
[48:58] under the law of
[49:00] adoption yes or
[49:05] yes all right I want you to get this
[49:07] this is
[49:09] important you only find three stages of
[49:13] jesus' life through the whole
[49:17] gospel think about it this is what it's
[49:20] all
[49:21] about when he said this is my beloved
[49:24] Son
[49:27] he's showing us that he had gone through
[49:29] this
[49:31] process the process of the law of
[49:36] adoption okay now now this is why it's
[49:39] so
[49:40] important there are many years of Jesus
[49:43] life we know nothing
[49:46] about my question to you is it was it
[49:49] not
[49:52] important why why are all these years
[49:54] missing from the Gospels
[49:57] you ever ask yourself I think they've
[50:00] tried to put out movies and and how
[50:02] Jesus was as a teenager and how he was
[50:04] as a young
[50:09] person but you don't find that in this
[50:11] in the in the
[50:14] gospels but there are three stages of
[50:17] his
[50:18] life number one his
[50:21] birth because that's the first law in
[50:24] the law of adoption that's the first
[50:26] stage
[50:29] the son has to be
[50:30] born right if there is no birth then
[50:34] there is no
[50:37] father How can there be a father without
[50:39] a
[50:40] son so the very first stage of jesus'
[50:44] life is the birth and through the
[50:48] gospels you find the birth of
[50:52] Jesus the birth of Jesus was on this
[50:54] wise
[50:56] and it goes on and and it even tells you
[50:59] about this is important now it tells you
[51:02] about after 8 Days his
[51:08] circumcision and then you don't hear
[51:10] nothing else about
[51:12] Jesus except after he's about two years
[51:16] old when when when the Lord tells when
[51:19] the angel of the Lord tells
[51:21] Joseph it's okay to return from Egypt
[51:24] back
[51:24] home herod's death
[51:27] but that's it so besides his
[51:31] birth and his
[51:33] circumcision you don't find nothing
[51:36] about
[51:37] Jesus until he's 12 years
[51:40] old now now think about this is the
[51:43] scriptures he's 12 years
[51:45] old and he's sitting in the
[51:49] temple and he's having
[51:52] discussions but the Bible says with
[51:54] doctors wait wait wait when the last
[51:57] time have you seen a 12-year-old having
[51:59] discussion with
[52:02] doctors but he showing us
[52:06] something he did not allow them to write
[52:09] anything else about
[52:12] him except the stages of the law of
[52:17] adoption getting and then after the 12y
[52:21] old
[52:24] story you read nothing about Jesus
[52:27] again for the next 18
[52:30] years what happened what did he
[52:33] do there it's showing us
[52:36] something that the important
[52:39] part was now coming at 30 years old now
[52:44] we see and we and it talks about his
[52:49] ministry it's a pattern here I want you
[52:52] to see this it it also revealed to us
[52:57] this is the life of an Israelite
[53:02] male that went that that goes through
[53:04] this
[53:05] process the pattern of Jesus's
[53:09] life also amplifies this on a spiritual
[53:12] level for
[53:14] us and shows us how it correlates to
[53:19] us in the life of an Israelite
[53:25] boy there were three major events that
[53:28] we just talked
[53:31] about and it it drew attention to
[53:36] him one number one and this is the three
[53:39] things we just went
[53:40] over the first event was his
[53:44] circumcision now you got to get this so
[53:47] you get the rest of the
[53:49] message the the first event was his
[53:53] circumcision which occurred when he was
[53:55] about eight days
[53:58] old this was the
[54:01] moment that he was marked as a covenant
[54:07] man now you you got to have your
[54:10] spiritual caps
[54:12] on because you have to see that all this
[54:15] correlates to us
[54:18] spiritually how many how many believe
[54:20] that you you've gotten the new
[54:23] birth how many have been circumcised in
[54:25] their heart
[54:27] and all these things cut
[54:29] away there's a
[54:31] circumcision and the circumcision marks
[54:34] you as a covenant
[54:38] people how many Covenant people do we
[54:41] have here this
[54:42] morning praise God it marked him as that
[54:47] and it was celebrated throughout the
[54:50] community we've got another Covenant
[54:53] man he was still a little baby but
[54:57] everybody was so
[54:58] happy we have another Covenant
[55:01] man isn't that what the way we should be
[55:04] this
[55:05] morning when we saw yesterday what God
[55:09] did I don't know there was some 12
[55:11] people that came to the
[55:14] Lord and we can say hallelujah this
[55:17] morning because more have been added to
[55:20] the
[55:22] Covenant the second major event
[55:26] was his bar
[55:28] mitzvah those of you know what I'm
[55:30] talking
[55:31] about it took place as he was about to
[55:35] enter into
[55:38] puberty the word Bar
[55:41] Mitzvah it actually means a son
[55:47] accountable or son of The
[55:51] Commandments and this
[55:54] signified that not only was he held
[55:57] accountable for keeping the Commandments
[55:59] of
[56:02] God but also he was to become an
[56:07] apprentice under his father and the
[56:10] family
[56:12] business this is usually around 12 years
[56:17] old have you seen the life of
[56:20] Jesus his
[56:21] circumcision 12 years old what does he
[56:25] declare
[56:27] son we've been looking for
[56:30] you looking for me don't you know I must
[56:33] be about my father's
[56:36] business he began to he started his
[56:38] apprenticeship if you would
[56:40] say that that's about the time brother
[56:43] Bram says of accountability right 12
[56:46] years
[56:48] old when we know right from
[56:50] wrong we should we should know right
[56:52] from wrong and you're accountable for it
[56:55] now
[56:57] he he was about his father's
[57:00] business and he had entered into the
[57:02] apprenticeship under the
[57:05] father and he was under tutors and
[57:09] governors until the time appointed of
[57:12] the
[57:13] father and the third
[57:15] event was what was known as
[57:21] quesia or the young man's adoption
[57:24] ceremony
[57:28] that word
[57:30] heia it means the son's
[57:36] placement it was when the male
[57:39] child reached what was considered to be
[57:42] the age of
[57:45] maturity somewhere around 30 years
[57:48] old and at this time the father of the
[57:51] young
[57:52] man would place his hand on the head of
[57:55] his son
[57:59] and openly
[58:02] Proclaim this is my beloved
[58:06] Son I am well pleased with him I bestow
[58:11] upon
[58:12] him all my
[58:14] riches and power and
[58:17] authority so that he can act on my
[58:22] behalf in all of my affairs
[58:27] okay so we come to the Lord young
[58:29] people yeah I don't know we have a hard
[58:33] time trying to understand the will of
[58:35] God is that
[58:37] right when we're young we we we've
[58:40] reached the age of of
[58:43] accountability and then we say is this
[58:44] all there is to
[58:47] it oh no oh no there's much more this 18
[58:52] years we don't hear of Jesus
[58:56] what is he doing he's learning the
[58:58] father's
[59:00] business he may not be the most
[59:04] popular hello everybody he may not be
[59:07] the most well
[59:09] known you might not see him too
[59:12] much because he's
[59:14] studying he's
[59:16] learning but he knows that there is a
[59:20] time appointed of the father that's
[59:23] coming come on young people there's a
[59:25] Time appointed for every one of
[59:29] you a time appointed of the
[59:32] father when he says you've come to
[59:37] maturity I want to stop here for a
[59:40] moment there I I've told this to people
[59:43] before to help
[59:45] them but my father was was my best
[59:51] friend my father my dad my pops my
[59:56] through his ministry there was something
[59:59] more it wasn't just my dad's the
[1:00:02] pastor that's
[1:00:04] wonderful and I could go to
[1:00:06] hell my dad being the
[1:00:09] pastor that doesn't I don't make it home
[1:00:11] because of
[1:00:12] that I I make it because because I gave
[1:00:16] my heart to the
[1:00:18] Lord and and I went through this
[1:00:21] process and this process from
[1:00:24] birth then it comes to circumcision it
[1:00:27] comes then to the
[1:00:30] accountability but I had to learn the
[1:00:32] process of
[1:00:34] this to come to this place of a of of
[1:00:38] being of being what would we say uh the
[1:00:42] law of
[1:00:45] adoption to come here to this
[1:00:47] point and so through it all I would
[1:00:50] listen to what he had to say and I would
[1:00:53] hear him and he would say learn
[1:00:56] when I'm not here you're going to you
[1:00:58] and your brothers you're going to have
[1:00:59] to take
[1:01:01] over you're going you're going to have
[1:01:03] to do this but the first thing that I
[1:01:06] had to do was capture the vision of the
[1:01:12] father it takes time to capture this and
[1:01:16] that's what we're doing we're learning
[1:01:18] the
[1:01:19] business we're learning what it is
[1:01:22] really to understand the law of adoption
[1:01:26] the son
[1:01:28] realizes it's not my own
[1:01:30] Vision I've got to capture the vision of
[1:01:33] the
[1:01:34] father so that if the father's not here
[1:01:38] then I must do exactly what the father
[1:01:40] would have
[1:01:41] done how are with me that's what we got
[1:01:44] to do every time we're in a
[1:01:48] situation we got to understand and say
[1:01:51] what would the father do in this
[1:01:53] situation
[1:01:56] it's not to make and do your own
[1:01:59] thing that son needs to go back with the
[1:02:02] tutors and
[1:02:05] governors no
[1:02:07] fail I have failed many
[1:02:10] times and brother Caleb wanted his own
[1:02:12] will
[1:02:14] done but I had to throw that
[1:02:17] away but I I I received another
[1:02:21] will it was the
[1:02:23] mystery of his will
[1:02:26] in my life and so then I would tell them
[1:02:29] this and I would talk about my
[1:02:32] father but the greatest time to me now
[1:02:34] this is me
[1:02:36] speaking the greatest time to
[1:02:38] me was the was the day that my father
[1:02:41] said
[1:02:42] this he's not just my
[1:02:46] son he is my fellow labor in the
[1:02:53] gospel oh come on now come on now now we
[1:02:56] want to hear that we desire to hear
[1:03:00] because it shows
[1:03:02] maturity it shows you've reached a
[1:03:05] point that the father has
[1:03:08] decided I can put this in his hands
[1:03:12] now you understand the three stages
[1:03:15] then and notice that through the through
[1:03:17] all the all the uh the uh all the
[1:03:21] gospels his
[1:03:24] birth years
[1:03:27] purpose for it
[1:03:28] all Romans 8:23 then says this and not
[1:03:32] only they but ourselves
[1:03:35] also which have the first fruits of the
[1:03:39] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:03:44] ourselves waiting for the
[1:03:47] adoption to
[1:03:50] Wi the Redemption of our
[1:03:53] body thus this adop
[1:03:57] is not simply the matter of our coming
[1:03:59] into the family of
[1:04:02] God by regeneration of
[1:04:05] spirit but rather it is something which
[1:04:08] is the end
[1:04:12] result of God's fiery
[1:04:17] dealings with us unto the full and
[1:04:20] complete surrender of our souls
[1:04:26] for when the son comes to
[1:04:29] maturity the enemy loses his
[1:04:33] place the enemy loses his
[1:04:36] title he loses his grip on
[1:04:40] you so how do you like that
[1:05:09] which simply means
[1:05:15] disclosure it means to take off the
[1:05:20] cover therefore it has to do
[1:05:23] with the exposure
[1:05:27] of something that has been hidden from
[1:05:33] view I look at every one of you because
[1:05:37] as we
[1:05:38] grow there's a lot of things in our life
[1:06:23] it has been
[1:06:24] hidden and held in
[1:06:28] obscurity it tells us the scripture
[1:06:31] tells
[1:06:32] us it tells us the scripture tells
[1:06:38] us uhoh uh oh and right now here's the
[1:06:44] devil hanging on your
[1:06:47] eyelids you're like man why are my
[1:06:50] eyelids heavier in
[1:06:54] church I'll tell you what why cuz
[1:06:57] there's little demonal hanging on your
[1:07:00] eyelids and every now and then they're
[1:07:05] like yeah that's what happens in church
[1:07:07] right that's why when when we're
[1:07:10] watching
[1:07:11] movies you ever know that there's
[1:07:13] there's no there's no devil hanging on
[1:07:22] your oh come on wait too you're way too
[1:07:26] serious for
[1:07:27] me it's the truth about things but here
[1:07:30] we come to to know about the law of
[1:07:34] adoption that our Eternal destination
[1:07:37] has to do with
[1:07:39] this and what do we do we fall asleep
[1:07:43] because it's not fun it's not
[1:07:46] entertaining but it's out of this
[1:07:49] world if you could
[1:07:51] realize that our lives it has a Heavenly
[1:07:55] meaning
[1:07:57] that go with our Earthly
[1:08:00] story every one of you has an Earthly
[1:08:04] story but my question to you is this do
[1:08:08] you have a Heavenly meaning to your
[1:08:12] story now the Bible says that Jesus
[1:08:15] without a parable spake he
[1:08:20] not what is it that's been hidden from
[1:08:23] View
[1:08:29] come on
[1:08:31] now oh the revelation of the
[1:08:34] word the revelation of the word is for a
[1:08:38] purpose it's not to say oh Look What the
[1:08:40] Lord showed
[1:08:41] me the revelation of the word is to do
[1:08:44] one
[1:08:45] thing to activate the seed in
[1:08:48] you because what was
[1:08:51] hidden out of view the apocalypse and
[1:08:56] has been
[1:08:57] uncovered is Christ in
[1:09:01] you that's what is coming into view
[1:09:03] right
[1:09:04] now sons of God church I hope you get
[1:09:09] this through the church
[1:09:12] age they were simply
[1:09:15] children children first second third
[1:09:18] fourth fifth
[1:09:19] sixth but at the end
[1:09:22] time these children
[1:09:25] to go become
[1:09:28] mature and and all
[1:09:32] creation all Church
[1:09:34] Ages were waiting for you and I to show
[1:09:38] up to show and put into
[1:09:42] view what a mature son and daughter of
[1:09:45] God
[1:09:47] is you get this I'm sorry I get excited
[1:09:50] but but that's what was in
[1:09:53] view not even to ourselves
[1:09:57] I don't
[1:09:58] know I don't know I don't know but when
[1:10:02] he comes into
[1:10:04] view and you begin to look at
[1:10:07] yourself not just as some
[1:10:10] Mortal I'm
[1:10:12] Immortal you're Immortal but when we
[1:10:15] look at each
[1:10:16] other but we look at at
[1:10:19] ourselves not just as Mortals anymore
[1:10:22] but as
[1:10:24] redeemed
[1:10:26] [Music]
[1:10:28] Eternal wait wait wait a minute wait a
[1:10:30] minute wait how many of you have ever

[1:11:17] that okay but have you ever looked in
[1:11:20] the
[1:11:21] mirror and looked in your own eyes
[1:11:25] the Bible says that the that the eyes
[1:11:27] are the window of the
[1:11:30] Soul how many have ever looked beyond
[1:11:32] your your carnal
[1:11:33] body look into your own
[1:11:37] soul and say there's an eternal
[1:11:41] part there is an eternal me inside this
[1:11:45] body on come on that's the one that's
[1:11:48] dying to get
[1:11:50] out he wants to he that's why we this
[1:11:53] this creature right here
[1:11:56] is not waiting or groaning for
[1:11:58] you this creature is groaning for
[1:12:03] me to manifest
[1:12:07] God we're always waiting for someone
[1:12:10] else to Manifest
[1:12:12] this you've got to manifest
[1:12:15] God that's why we struggle and struggle
[1:12:18] and
[1:12:19] struggle because your
[1:12:22] creature is wanting to manifest God
[1:12:26] wants to manifest what's on the inside
[1:12:28] oh Lord I'm not getting anywhere my
[1:12:31] message brother adul help me
[1:12:38] here these matur
[1:12:40] sons have surrendered fully to the will
[1:12:43] of the
[1:12:45] father Romans 121 and 2 says I beseech
[1:12:48] you therefore
[1:12:50] Brethren that you present your bodies a
[1:12:52] Living Sacrifice
[1:12:56] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:12:58] reasonable
[1:13:02] service not conformed to this
[1:13:05] world but be ye
[1:13:07] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:13:10] mind that you may
[1:13:13] prove what is the now there's three
[1:13:16] here what is the good acceptable and
[1:13:20] perfect will of
[1:13:22] God Paul said his will has been made
[1:13:25] made known to
[1:13:28] us and I just want to tell you this
[1:13:31] morning his will is
[1:13:36] good oh come on now I want to say it
[1:13:39] again his will is
[1:13:41] good his will is
[1:13:44] acceptable his will is
[1:13:48] perfect that's we can't say that about
[1:13:50] our
[1:13:51] will but but Paul to the Romans is
[1:13:54] saying that
[1:13:56] the good and acceptable and perfect will
[1:13:59] of
[1:14:01] God that's why when when we read these
[1:14:05] things we don't understand the will of
[1:14:08] God many
[1:14:10] times it's a mystery but we've got to
[1:14:14] understand the
[1:14:16] mystery the will of God is
[1:14:21] intricate listen closely my 's are
[1:14:24] almost out okay
[1:14:26] the will of God is
[1:14:29] intricate it has and deals with so many
[1:14:33] complex interrelating
[1:14:40] parts and elements that's right you see
[1:14:44] the will of God doesn't just have to
[1:14:47] take into consideration your
[1:14:51] needs your
[1:14:53] life your
[1:14:56] petitions listen closely now this is the
[1:14:58] message now the will of God doesn't just
[1:15:01] have to do to to do
[1:15:03] that it takes into
[1:15:07] consideration those around
[1:15:11] you well Lord I I want this and Lord why
[1:15:15] don't you give me this and why don't you
[1:15:18] make me
[1:15:18] this it takes into consideration those
[1:15:22] around you
[1:15:25] the will of God is
[1:15:27] good acceptable and it's perfect it
[1:15:32] takes into
[1:15:34] consideration all those that are
[1:15:36] connected to you in the
[1:15:39] past in the present in the
[1:15:45] future this will of God is
[1:15:48] amazing it must take into
[1:15:51] consideration the prayers of those that
[1:15:54] prayed for you
[1:15:56] before it must take into consideration
[1:15:59] your
[1:16:00] prayers and it must take to consider
[1:16:03] those in the
[1:16:05] future who your prayers will
[1:16:09] affect on and on we can
[1:16:12] go for when God made a promise to
[1:16:16] Abraham his will had to make
[1:16:20] sure that that
[1:16:22] promise was passed from gener generation
[1:16:25] to
[1:16:28] generation but not just in the natural
[1:16:32] seed he had to make
[1:16:34] sure that the
[1:16:36] promise was all the way to you and
[1:16:41] I he works all
[1:16:44] things once again his will he works all
[1:16:49] things after the counsel of his
[1:16:53] will so his will gives
[1:16:57] counsel they're praying for
[1:17:00] this but years
[1:17:02] ago I can still the prayer of their
[1:17:09] mama but Lord I want to do this why
[1:17:13] can't I do it because somebody over
[1:17:16] here prayed for
[1:17:18] you and the prayer went up to the
[1:17:22] nostrils and it still smack out so
[1:17:26] good they can't go that way that
[1:17:29] way because his mama and his daddy
[1:17:33] prayed the counsel of his
[1:17:37] will I'm going to hit that one later on
[1:17:40] not
[1:17:41] today watch this now from generation to
[1:17:45] generation he works all things after the
[1:17:48] Council of his
[1:17:50] will that's why his will is
[1:17:53] good his will is
[1:17:55] acceptable his will is
[1:17:58] perfect you see in the western
[1:18:02] culture we we focus on the individual
[1:18:05] achievements
[1:18:06] right this is what I'm going to do oh I
[1:18:09] want to be this I want to do
[1:18:11] this but the Jews don't think of it like
[1:18:17] that in the he to the Hebrews the
[1:18:20] person's
[1:18:22] identity came almost entirely from his
[1:18:27] family
[1:18:29] Generation generation and he had a
[1:18:33] responsibility to keep that
[1:18:39] going why he said I am the god of
[1:18:44] Abraham of Isaac and Jacob it was the
[1:18:48] same God and that was the perfect will
[1:18:51] of
[1:18:52] God going from generation to watch this
[1:18:55] now that's why Israel and the church run
[1:19:00] parallel because their story is our
[1:19:02] story
[1:19:04] too his will has to make
[1:19:07] sure that it comes out
[1:19:10] right both in the natural and the
[1:19:14] spiritual Ephesians 15 having
[1:19:17] predestinated
[1:19:19] us unto the adoption of
[1:19:22] children wait a minute wait a minute
[1:19:24] here's the the scripture in John chapter
[1:19:27] 1 to them gave he
[1:19:30] power to become sons of
[1:19:33] God the word son there is an infant it's
[1:19:38] a baby he gave you power to be born
[1:19:41] again so that you could be a Son of God
[1:19:45] even though you were always a son but
[1:19:48] now you're manifesting it he gave us
[1:19:51] power there but now in Ephesians
[1:19:54] Paul catches the
[1:19:56] Revelation and he says the adoption of
[1:20:00] children that's the
[1:20:04] word which means the
[1:20:08] adoption Paul's not talking to these
[1:20:10] Ephesians as little
[1:20:12] kids he's talking to them as
[1:20:15] mature by Jesus Christ
[1:20:18] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:20:21] of his
[1:20:22] will I got a couple couple minutes now
[1:20:25] just let me just brother I just need
[1:20:27] like can you give me Grace finish this
[1:20:29] point thank you sir thank you sir and I
[1:20:32] owe you big
[1:20:34] time watch and this is this is what's
[1:20:37] tremendous the Council of his will is so
[1:20:42] amazing and that's why I thank God for a
[1:20:44] prophet because he showed us that he
[1:20:48] could not
[1:20:51] predestinate by his will
[1:20:55] the wisdom of his
[1:20:58] will he knew he could not predestinate
[1:21:02] us according to his
[1:21:04] will you know why because his will was
[1:21:08] that no one would
[1:21:10] perish so he couldn't base
[1:21:12] predestination on his
[1:21:15] will he based it upon his forn
[1:21:19] knowledge and by his for
[1:21:22] knowledge he knew who would and who
[1:21:24] wouldn't serve
[1:21:29] him predestinated Us by his forn
[1:21:33] knowledge but once he predestinated
[1:21:37] Us by his forn
[1:21:39] knowledge then
[1:21:41] predestination looks to
[1:21:44] Destiny Hallelujah I hope you get
[1:21:47] this make it as easy once again
[1:21:50] predestination then looks to Destiny and
[1:21:54] when it looks to
[1:21:56] Destiny the perfect will of God stands
[1:21:58] up
[1:22:01] again said now it's my
[1:22:03] turn I got to make sure that through
[1:22:07] their life they reach their
[1:22:10] Destiny now he's doing this by the
[1:22:13] counsel of his
[1:22:15] will and not by forn knowledge anymore
[1:22:18] he's already used the four
[1:22:22] knowledge watch this now because watch
[1:22:25] this is so
[1:22:26] tremendous by doing this he realizes
[1:22:30] that's the only way for his plan
[1:22:34] toold because his will has so many
[1:22:37] complex
[1:22:39] Parts takes into consideration all the
[1:22:42] other
[1:22:44] elements of his own nature and
[1:22:47] being it can't just act on its
[1:22:51] own it has to take everything into
[1:22:53] consideration
[1:22:56] his for
[1:22:57] knowledge his purpose his election his
[1:23:01] plan Destiny persons actors enemies it
[1:23:06] takes it all into
[1:23:08] consideration so that his will can be
[1:23:13] done can your will do
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:23] that we know but that's why we know tell
[1:23:27] your neighbor his will is
[1:23:30] good acceptable perfect and that's why
[1:23:34] we know one of the greatest scriptures
[1:23:38] that is that is so
[1:23:42] misunderstood Romans
[1:23:44] 8:28 for we know that all things work
[1:23:46] together for
[1:23:50] good so misunderstood and misused
[1:23:55] I can do whatever I want anyways it all
[1:23:58] work together at the
[1:24:00] end you ain't going to make it with that
[1:24:03] mentality you'll never make it you got
[1:24:05] to take the counsel of his
[1:24:08] will and we know how many here
[1:24:12] knows why are we always worried then
[1:24:15] stressed out do we really know that all
[1:24:19] things work
[1:24:20] together for good to them
[1:24:24] that love God first of
[1:24:27] all them who are the
[1:24:30] called according to his
[1:24:33] purpose oh I like that this is so
[1:24:37] tremendous he'll make all things work
[1:24:40] together for
[1:24:42] good but only to them that love
[1:24:45] God only to them who are the called
[1:24:48] according to his
[1:24:51] purpose then how can you live outside of
[1:24:53] the conf fines of the
[1:24:56] word and still expect all things to work
[1:24:59] together for
[1:25:01] good the only good
[1:25:03] thing is the good and acceptable and
[1:25:06] perfect will of
[1:25:09] God that's why if we don't find his
[1:25:13] will we ain't going to get
[1:25:16] nowhere it's a
[1:25:18] mystery but the
[1:25:20] mystery has been unfolded
[1:25:24] and that's I took four minutes
[1:25:28] longer but I'll hit that on
[1:25:33] Sunday God bless you
[1:25:36] [Applause]
[1:26:08] amen
[1:26:11] amen how do you like
[1:26:16] that
[1:26:22] amen amig that's why he's my
[1:26:27] friend I want to have friends like
[1:26:31] that that is the word of
[1:26:35] God but how would you
[1:26:39] like to see the word of
[1:26:42] God but manifest it
[1:26:48] today it's beautiful to hear the
[1:26:52] word but we want for the word
[1:26:54] word to be
[1:26:58] manifested that it be made
[1:27:00] flesh amen
[1:27:05] amen and that's what we want to do
[1:27:10] today under a cloud of
[1:27:14] witnesses the hour have come
[1:27:20] Brethren that what I've been speaking in
[1:27:22] my past messages
[1:27:27] I've entitled the qualifications of a
[1:27:30] pastor you remember
[1:27:33] that well
[1:27:37] today I wish bring before all of
[1:27:40] you two
[1:27:44] candidates first candidate is Jud would
[1:27:47] be Juda
[1:27:50] mat other candidate is
[1:27:54] would Beth
[1:27:59] mat I wish to present and propose him to
[1:28:01] the
[1:28:03] church to put brother
[1:28:07] Judah as associate
[1:28:11] [Applause]
[1:28:22] pastor and I would like to place brother
[1:28:26] as assistant to the
[1:28:35] pastor
[1:28:37] now associate
[1:28:42] pastor in the
[1:28:45] denomination they call it
[1:28:48] co-pastor the word co-pastor
[1:28:54] would me Co or equal to the
[1:28:57] pastor I don't believe that you
[1:29:00] understand
[1:29:02] that I don't believe in a
[1:29:05] co-equal there is no
[1:29:08] co-equals I am the pastor of this
[1:29:11] location and when I am out I am still
[1:29:14] the
[1:29:16] pastor there's no
[1:29:21] co-equal brother Bram called them Co
[1:29:24] Pastor because he was in the
[1:29:28] denomination but when he brought the
[1:29:30] message to the
[1:29:32] church he called it associate
[1:29:37] pastor so we will never call it
[1:29:40] co-equal we will never call it
[1:29:44] co-pastor but associate
[1:29:46] pastor are we all in agreement
[1:29:50] then blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:29:55] now through the
[1:29:57] years we've learned a lot of
[1:30:02] lessons and amongst all those lessons
[1:30:05] we've
[1:30:07] heard is that a lot of times the
[1:30:11] pastor is called on God's
[1:30:15] behalf maybe there's an
[1:30:17] accident maybe there's a
[1:30:20] sickness and then the church
[1:30:24] enters into
[1:30:28] chaos because there's no one who's been
[1:30:32] assigned and the people don't ask
[1:30:35] themselves oh what are we going to do
[1:30:39] now where are we going to
[1:30:44] now who's going to be the place the
[1:30:46] person to take the next
[1:30:47] [Music]
[1:30:52] place but and we'll call it a commotion
[1:30:57] arises and then religious politics come
[1:31:02] in we don't want religious
[1:31:08] politics because we have worked a long
[1:31:10] time for this
[1:31:12] place we put a lot of hours of
[1:31:16] work we've worked a
[1:31:19] lot that if one day the Lord should call
[1:31:21] us
[1:31:24] that everything be
[1:31:27] dismayed everyone go one place and then
[1:31:30] another place without knowing what to
[1:31:37] do that's how we must set things in
[1:31:41] order but as Caleb was
[1:31:43] speaking the
[1:31:48] father always searches or waits for the
[1:31:51] maturity of the son
[1:31:54] when he can be called into
[1:31:57] adoption under till then he is under
[1:32:02] tutors and understanding the vision of
[1:32:04] the
[1:32:08] father I could say these young
[1:32:11] men have reached the
[1:32:17] maturity I remember a lot brother K's
[1:32:22] father and I remember when Caleb turned
[1:32:24] 30 years
[1:32:29] old you know what he told
[1:32:32] him said
[1:32:34] Son now you can be a
[1:32:37] prince because you can be unless you be
[1:32:40] 30 years of
[1:32:42] age that
[1:32:44] tremendous am
[1:32:50] amen so when the Lord should call me to
[1:32:52] go to the missionary field
[1:32:55] the one who will stay in
[1:32:58] charge will be the associate pastor you
[1:33:01] understand me
[1:33:05] Breen I'm speaking to the Church of a
[1:33:07] pastor
[1:33:12] Tabernacle so that we'll know how we're
[1:33:14] going to run with
[1:33:17] this now I as
[1:33:22] Pastor have valuated the
[1:33:28] situation I have considered it and
[1:33:30] meditated
[1:33:31] on I placed it under
[1:33:34] prayer to make this
[1:33:36] decision now I
[1:33:40] understand that the decision which we
[1:33:42] are
[1:33:44] making not all will be in
[1:33:49] accordance maybe we might have different
[1:33:52] thoughts and that's
[1:33:54] fine we are all
[1:33:59] individuals but I want to say that after
[1:34:02] prayer and great
[1:34:05] consideration we are taking this
[1:34:10] decision to have an associate
[1:34:20] pastor to have a assistant pastor to
[1:34:23] assist the pastor and
[1:34:27] Associate now the word assist
[1:34:32] assistant that word is
[1:34:38] self-explanatory it's to assist the
[1:34:40] pastor in many
[1:34:44] activities and to assist the associate
[1:34:50] pastor now these two positions offices
[1:34:55] working
[1:34:58] together can do
[1:35:06] wonders I'm working together because I
[1:35:08] know
[1:35:11] both I actually know them since their
[1:35:17] birth those who know
[1:35:21] Judah you know he's very
[1:35:24] yeah he can't
[1:35:29] Restless he he throws
[1:35:31] himself he takes
[1:35:35] risks and those who
[1:35:37] know he's very calm see
[1:35:41] yes he's very still
[1:35:49] passive when I spoke on the
[1:35:50] qualifications of a pastor
[1:35:54] I spoke of a
[1:35:58] balance so can you
[1:36:01] imagine one who takes
[1:36:04] risks and one who's
[1:36:08] calm so that's Balan is it
[1:36:13] not amen
[1:36:17] amen and that's what we
[1:36:21] seek if one goes too far ahead
[1:36:26] the other one says hey hold on slow
[1:36:30] down calm down Cal
[1:36:34] down if the other one doesn't do
[1:36:37] anything says come on hurry up come on
[1:36:40] let's do it what are you waiting
[1:36:44] for it's a
[1:36:47] balance is that what it
[1:36:50] is that's what we're doing
[1:36:58] I know them very well since their
[1:37:01] birth many are going to be able to
[1:37:04] say brother what you're
[1:37:07] doing is
[1:37:10] favoritism and you're doing
[1:37:13] it just because they're your
[1:37:16] sons
[1:37:17] okay I understand that
[1:37:21] thought but just for a brief moment
[1:37:27] okay we're going to consider Judah
[1:37:31] and for a
[1:37:36] moment I will not consider them as my
[1:37:38] own
[1:37:40] Sons as though they were not my
[1:37:44] sons and we can go back for a
[1:37:47] moment to their
[1:37:50] infancy to their childhood
[1:37:55] they have grown up in the
[1:37:59] church in the pews that you're
[1:38:02] sitting a lot of times and they would
[1:38:04] sit and sleep in the
[1:38:08] pews they were raised up in the
[1:38:13] gospel they were raised up in the
[1:38:14] message of the
[1:38:17] hour they were raised up in
[1:38:21] obedience and they were raised up to
[1:38:23] have respect
[1:38:27] respect they were taught to respect the
[1:38:32] Brethren they were
[1:38:35] presented one by Brother Bernie
[1:38:38] Garcia and the other by Brother fa
[1:38:42] Bernal as
[1:38:45] youth they were clean
[1:38:50] youth part of the qualifications of a
[1:38:52] pastoring
[1:38:55] I can
[1:38:57] say they were never in
[1:39:02] drugs they were never in
[1:39:05] alcohol they never went to a
[1:39:09] dance they were never with
[1:39:13] women I am a witness of
[1:39:18] that they had a clean youth
[1:39:24] you never saw them have
[1:39:26] girlfriends they each had only one
[1:39:29] girlfriend and that's the one they
[1:39:33] married and they never went out
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:45] anywhere and I'm speaking not as though
[1:39:48] they are my
[1:39:51] sons I am not seeing them from that
[1:39:52] point of view
[1:39:56] now you not have heard them
[1:40:00] preach have you heard them preach
[1:40:06] amen few Ministers of the
[1:40:11] Gospel can attain the level they're
[1:40:14] at in
[1:40:16] preaching in
[1:40:19] Revelation and administering of the word
[1:40:21] of
[1:40:22] God
[1:40:23] okay
[1:40:26] now they see that
[1:40:29] Footprints is
[1:40:35] possession have you seen Judah
[1:40:37] lately that he's in
[1:40:40] everything seen him or
[1:40:42] not he runs here he runs over
[1:40:47] there he needs this to be done this
[1:40:51] that he's in everything
[1:40:56] and I don't say it because he's my
[1:40:59] son but that the Church of Pastor
[1:41:03] Tabernacle can
[1:41:08] realize that he's about his father's
[1:41:10] business or no yes or
[1:41:14] no he's about his father's
[1:41:18] business so then the question I ask
[1:41:23] does he fulfill the
[1:41:27] qualifications yes
[1:41:29] brother I can affirm
[1:41:32] yes I can affirm of oth as
[1:41:36] well but
[1:41:39] assistant and assisting other people
[1:41:43] amen
[1:41:47] amen so we take this
[1:41:52] time beautiful preaching of brother
[1:41:58] Kum to position these two
[1:42:01] Brethren and we should do
[1:42:06] it as it must do through a vote
[1:42:14] okay that those who can
[1:42:20] vote are the members of a pasor
[1:42:22] tabernacle
[1:42:24] amen our Brethren who are
[1:42:27] guests I will ask
[1:42:30] you not lift up your
[1:42:34] hand only Brethren of Pastor
[1:42:41] Tabernacle so who the question is who
[1:42:43] can vote
[1:42:45] okay I'm gonna ask you who I'm going to
[1:42:47] tell you who can
[1:42:49] vote that's members of the Tabernacle
[1:42:53] through the message of the
[1:42:56] hour the member of a
[1:43:01] tabernacle is that they assist regularly
[1:43:03] the
[1:43:07] services and they support the work of
[1:43:09] that
[1:43:12] church and they do it through
[1:43:14] offerings and
[1:43:17] tithing that is the meaning of a
[1:43:22] member assist the services
[1:43:25] regularly they give offering and they
[1:43:28] give
[1:43:29] tith according to the message that's the
[1:43:32] definition of a
[1:43:36] member so you can check yourself
[1:43:41] now and see if you have the right to
[1:43:45] vote but let's consider the
[1:43:48] youth they they do come regularly to
[1:43:51] church
[1:43:53] are active in the
[1:43:57] church maybe they could give an offering
[1:43:59] of what they
[1:44:00] have but maybe they can't give
[1:44:03] tithing because they're not even working
[1:44:06] yet so we won't be legalists no
[1:44:09] no how can a young man or
[1:44:13] woman give tithing on something he
[1:44:15] doesn't
[1:44:17] have so if these
[1:44:20] youth says well then I don't qualify to
[1:44:22] vote
[1:44:23] no if you're
[1:44:25] young and you're assisting
[1:44:30] regularly you offer them when you can
[1:44:32] what you can you can
[1:44:36] vote so to the youth I'm giving the
[1:44:41] opportunity so as all
[1:44:45] understood now we've heard it
[1:44:47] biblically
[1:44:51] today that which we heard heard
[1:44:56] biblically we should not do it
[1:45:02] literally so go back to the same
