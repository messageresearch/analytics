answers he knows there's nothing he doesn't know when the truth comes to light everything is exposed so i'm doubting my doubts and i'm trusting his word this is the best news that i've ever heard the only answer i need in life is christ oh jesus changed my life there's not one truth i will deny oh jesus changed my life there's not one truth i will deny oh jesus changed my life there's not one truth i will deny oh jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] and there's nothing he doesn't know when the truth comes to light everything is exposed now i'm doubting my doubts i'm trusting his word this is the best news that i've ever heard the only answer i need in life or the only answer i need in life the only answer i need in life is pride it's all stan how many of you believe the only answer is christ this morning there's nothing else let's say good morning to a couple of my friends this morning i haven't seen in several years our our travels throughout the years we've got to meet pockets of people here and there is and it seems like that it's always a limited time that i get to spend in people's lives i personally have many regrets because it doesn't seem like there's ever enough time to spin with the body of christ and i made friends as i've passed through here a couple times brother daniel amigos worshipping a minute ago and i accidentally call him the accident because there's a few daniels in my life and siri just assumes that i want to call the brother daniel down around las vegas then when you get him on the phone and you didn't really mean to call him you're like anyway god has a time for things i wanted to say thank you to brother caleb for the fellowship yesterday we took a few minutes and it just caused [Music] and he's working and he's very thankful and so are we we've enjoyed our fellowship and last night i saw fellowship with brother robert and sister spring lucas and miles are fixing to have some cousins hopefully we figure out the road back and forth and everybody gets to play together every once in a while all right there's fellowship to be had is when we get to because as long as we absolutely seems like the holy spirit laid a little subject on her heart i asked some of the family last night the rodriguez i said what should i preach i already had to buy a bible okay and unfortunately there's a quickening that comes because i have two questions i'm sorry to keep you on your feet so long let's turn so we need the holy spirit interpreter oh it says watch yeah villa stand fast in the face that firm in the king james version here it says quit you like men if you take that into like an amplified translation paul is simply saying pablo's implemented be a man be mature stand fast be courageous don't be afraid be strong let all your things be done with charity i beseech you brethren hermanos you know the house of stephanos that it's the first fruits of achaea and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the same my brother told me he was going to help me with that you have a spanish bible it doesn't have that word i'm talking about my addiction we'll pray together at the end of i believe in a body in order as this one is in i actually believe we have a perimeter guard brother uh caleb shared a testimony with me yesterday in africa [Music] there were deacons evidently there obviously men that were responsible for keeping orders as the disruption began to mount of course they can correct the testimony if i get it wrong but they and because the word of god says mark 16 we'll follow those that believe the spirits the spirit manifested themselves in the natural realm and they slammed the door on their way out sometimes being it's i believe in these men it didn't take me a few minutes at the table yesterday no ego actually the only ambition i witnessed but and without that offspring it dies we were talking about the revival there is a revival in christ that has come in this last days that will the word of god the word of god when i was listening to brother caleb and brother tommy talked about they almost finished each other's sentences i almost said sandwiches because said you know my brother kind of started preaching when he was four years old and he never stopped you know and i said well i kind of know what that's like i didn't tell him yesterday i'll tell you all my mom and dad had gone into this little place in tennessee in tennessee dad was trying to help a church tell us about the message of the hour zealous about the truth of what god had done in our days before i was born he told my mom my folks were baptist people my dad told my mom i believe the preachers are right jesus is coming back but i don't know all there is to know about the word of god and if he ever did something that before he returns he's got to send somebody on the scene like he did john the baptist said and if god don't show me pretty soon [Music] it was or is guinness my is and so when i was born what do you see all i ever knew was what god had done in our days i was born in the journey i'll get that reference she said i was having a pity party pity parties we were in an attic that had a one window a mattress on the floor and a bathroom in the corner kind of makes you and she said i would have to keep you quiet i held your little sister i kept you on the mat she said the first time the anointing ever fell on you and you said she said you looked around she said we had one chair already you said you still love the chair amen [Applause] as i got a little older i told brother caleb part of my testimony my dad was talking to a teenager in his church he said my son thinks he has the holy ghost i dreamed of the rapture and i didn't go you know i missed the raft i told dad i don't care where you have to be where we have to go young people last night were talking about some of the young people's fellowship they were talking about having that oil to pass through the dimensions each other don't know a steak knife to cut that out of my addiction and i thought i want to do that oh let's study the word of god for the day and now in which we live 1962 so a few years ago right 60 years ago but the word of god is eternal i believe do you believe this over in tempe arizona god don't have any little bitty children as i am right i forgot to greet you from pastor stephen shelley in alabama

do the life reproduces it's the only unhybridized thing left is brother you couldn't pick up a stone off the ground to throw with a giant you need to find your voice yeah [Music] died and buried in christ if we wasn't always then we're raised in the resurrection he's making the resurrection dead rose to life we're amen mercy i got about 30 minutes left is that right yo y'all watch me i've only

didn't have to be thrown in they might have been i don't know if it was a pill they just started fellowship they just started walking around actually the bands that were holding them broken [Applause] [Applause] has somebody i almost made a tv reference because that's going to say clue the jeopardy music doo doo okay okay not let's not i'm not sure the lord's really everybody know what i'm looking for there's this i think it says the angel the laodiceans right these things so we're we're somewhere in chapter three she raised her arm 321 what's to say sis make her a mike my brother take your mind to him that overcometh will i grant sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and i'm set down with him with my father in his throne where's your mama where's your daddy are they here i didn't even recognize you you've grown so much sorry stand up mom dad is that promised is that promise of the word of god to her does she get to sit down with christ in his throne how about at church you want mom and dad's little girl to sit with jesus in his throat i am an overcomer i believe the word of god is i did how is it that happens y'all ever wonder how that happened we don't have to be afraid of you they're not even called to do what we okay we got one yes sir and the word oh the blood does it oh all i've ever known is trying to get somebody to believe differencia do you see it do you see it do you believe it oh my it will make a difference and how can i overcome 1963 you 1963 back in jeffersonville again jeffersonville brother branham says he said there's always been an ark in god's economy there was an ark in the days of noah and that ark is not yes neither is it good works it's by one spirit especially we are all baptized brother tom finish his sentence because it's the same spirit working in both spirits when brother diego diego is he here this morning why when brother diego prayed over the family that was traveling under divine inspiration of the holy spirit god heard his prayers you have seen daniel miller i don't know how many offspring christ has no problem jesus sometimes we're too careful we're too guarded we're too protected and we don't hear the word of god [Music] that's got to have a donkey run my leg into the wall because the donkey had more spiritual eyesight than the prophet of god donkey bailey wanted to kill his dog that's the way some people do you got incredible servants [Music] hey there's an angel standing right there with his sword drawing because you're disciplining god that'll preach if it wasn't for a godly woman watching the prophet's back we need men and women have god that's yours to raise up okay and to learn the word of god raise the eye learn the word of god you'll begin to confess baby women can you say baby i love you this comes first [Music] i look at these ladies right here sitting next to these men of god i realized this morning ladies do you mind thomas would you stand please see the point in the pier we have examples and i thank god but i'm not trying to see how far up i can get my skirt on i'm not trying to see how tight i can get it wrapped around me i'm looking to women of god i have been walking in the spirit [Music] it don't always work that way no i know it don't always work that way there are gifted men that get in trouble their children don't follow in their ways but it always one example we'll move on i'm almost done it always costs us eli's sons we're like and for a moment like moses and that is not the condition of the bride of jesus christ christ does not want us dead he wants his life manifested in us a few years ago i i've done so many job things in my life it's embarrassing a few years ago remember laying there about two o'clock in the morning and he didn't stop with the second adam he actually took me to a revelation of justification the reason i'm sharing this with you is because of the comment brother brown just made in that quote he said your past doesn't matter neither how good one of my testimonies used to be that i never smoked and i never drank i found out that didn't have nothing to do with my salvation so excited about what i had done i used to brag about it i wasn't helping anybody because when i went to preach there were going to be a lot of young people are you are mucho hoevenes and a lot of you old folks that couldn't say no they never smoked and they never died so when i'm up there beating my chest about what a great thing is that religious much less about the second attack and i prayed and i fell asleep praying i said god please don't ever let me get a religious spirit i didn't mean lord i didn't mean to hurt your people i wanted to help your people but i was going to have to stop certain actions fellowship with the rodriguez last night gabe was there rodriguez yeah he was going to give birth to a rodriguez well he's not and he is but rodriguez right i think that's right i know in some cultures it changes you guys last name rodriguez now that i've walked out on this plank he's going to give birth to a baby that's going to bear a name when a holy ghost person experiences the birth of christ they become christians receive it if there's still work for us to do in the continent of africa and other places i assume he's going to give me more revelations because when i went fishing the other day i couldn't walk out on the river to get in the boat i had to use the dock my king didn't need a dog necessity another one of my buddies you know i was talking about my three hebrew buddies right i had another buddy one time he learned from the king that he the molecular structure and walks through it philip needed to be somewhere else so god gave him the faith i'm assuming not to be too who nope say i wasn't there all i do know is that one minute he was one place next minute somehow there's revelations by me because i have to drive a truck and it's mine yes me because it's all under the shed blood you cannot overcome yourself that overcome for you you what just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hole is preacher comes out and preaches on holiness why has he got to be harping on holiness just let us rush you because of god's garments how pleased the king [Applause] i told some saints brother josh had an experience with god the other day i said i come on a holy roller until josh prayed through it i was trying to hold him because i didn't want him hurting himself i didn't know i had never seen a birth like that what's going on i've been to a few birthings just thought there was a new one and you know that's the message about your birth in christ specific calling the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcome alvin knows the way brother will when i willingly do the blood will never lose his power is that okay i'm going to sing i can't probably sing so y'all me a choir can sing from where you're at how many of you believes the blood is the same today i'm going to read one more scripture and then we're going to uh turn it back to the pastor i'm going to i promise to pray whatever happens may it be the will of god first john chapter 3 my little children let us not love inward neither in tongue but indeed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts for if our heart condemn us not represent young people listen to me for just a minute you've got things going on right now you know when you do it you don't guess how it makes you feel you know part of that is because your mom and daddy had the good sense to tell you that's not a good idea it don't make your mom and daddy feel good it may be a little bit their own pride i taught you better than that your actions may condemn them i don't care i mean i'm important if you live on their revelations until you get one in your own what do you think about these heels i imagine brother caleb feels about heels like brother branham felt about heels church in the world has been asking well how high is too high like is you've been looking at things on the internet nothing god lives we have confidence of this guy that took up abode right here in the throne and i'm living with him in his throne we have common story and whatsoever we ask him because we keep his commandments listen to those things that are pleasing in his sight this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son one another gave us commandments you don't need me to pray for you i promise to pray with you but there are saints of god sitting in these pews there are young people righteous like you said they have born-again experiences trying to lie to them and tell them they've not been born again okay do you want a closer walkway i want a closer wall i want to close the wall i'm going to pray for you [Music] i believe when you see brother henry this morning you see me understand that i'm going to understand maybe i mean [Music] and i believe when you see daniel daniel jesus it's what jesus prayed for right now we're going to pray for one another why don't you look around at some of these hands that went up young men listen to me lord i'm sorry for what i looked at on the internet sorry for that search i did on my phone would you please take away i know i can erase it off the memory heavenly father for my brother henry this morning i ask you lord give him all that he desires give him outpouring fresh baptism lord i believe there's baptism after baptism when the choir was singing this morning i got excited when they began to sing about that blood it was so real to me and i ask you lord to make it real to me once again may i walk out of here in newness of life and may my brother henry also lord for these saints that are praying for one another they don't need a preacher lord they need one another we are standing side by side shoulder to shoulder back to back god you made us a body i got parents in here that are worried about their kids god i got kids in here they're worried about their mama [Music] oh jesus may you answer the call of each one today as we pray in the precious name of the lord jesus christ oh
