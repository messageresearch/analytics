[16:58] instead oh my my
[17:00] i am so privileged to have this
[17:04] opportunity so soon again to share with
[17:07] you about
[17:08] privilege
[17:12] the inoculation of
[17:17] how god remember what is the inoculation
[17:19] of god
[17:22] what is it yes
[17:26] it's the holy ghost
[17:32] but tonight we want to see
[17:36] how jesus paid the price for all this
[17:39] como jesus
[17:41] we're going to see how the resurrection
[17:55] to be able to deliver on what he had
[17:58] told them
[18:01] so that he could breathe upon them
[18:07] and say receive the holy ghost
[18:12] i don't want to get ahead of myself but
[18:14] it's such a privilege and honor i thank
[18:16] our pastor
[18:19] let me look at the clock at 7 30 on the
[18:21] dot
[18:23] so pray for me that i i stay obedient
[18:28] turn in our bibles to acts chapter 2.
[18:32] and
[18:33] we're going to
[18:34] go to verse 23
[18:37] verse 23
[18:40] and we're going to read to verse 27
[18:44] amen amen
[18:47] him being delivered by the determinate
[18:49] counsel and foreknowledge of god you
[18:52] have taken and by wicked hands have
[18:54] crucified and slain
[19:05] whom god has raised up having loosed the
[19:09] pains of death because it was not
[19:12] possible that he should be held of it
[19:23] for david speaks concerning him i
[19:25] foresaw the lord always before my face
[19:30] for he is on my right hand
[19:33] that i should not be moved
[19:43] therefore did my heart rejoice and my
[19:45] tongue was glad more also moreover also
[19:49] my flesh
[19:51] shall rest
[19:52] in hope
[20:00] so i say to your flesh tonight
[20:15] amen amen so we don't have to get all
[20:17] worked up when we get attacked by the
[20:19] devil
[20:22] oh we do
[20:23] i have
[20:25] but as we mature in the lord
[20:31] it just gets to the point
[20:34] the other day i told satan when he came
[20:36] to bother me
[20:39] i asked him don't you have anything
[20:41] better to do
[20:45] than to try to bother god's children
[20:49] but i guess he'll do it until
[20:51] the resurrection comes
[20:56] verse 27
[20:59] because you will not leave my soul in
[21:02] hell look how personal this got to jesus
[21:08] you're not going to leave my soul in
[21:10] hell
[21:12] neither will you allow your holy one to
[21:16] seek corruption
[21:21] now let's jump to verse 31 to save on a
[21:24] little bit of time but read read this
[21:26] whole thing at home
[21:33] he's seen this before spoke of the
[21:36] resurrection of christ
[21:38] that his soul was not left in hell
[21:41] neither his flesh did seek corruption
[21:50] this jesus has god raised up where for
[21:54] of we are witnesses
[22:06] for the privilege to speak to your
[22:09] children lord
[22:35] thank you lord jesus now bless us
[22:39] and bless our efforts to bring forth
[22:41] your word lord
[22:45] and may it be you speaking to your
[22:47] children
[22:50] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[23:07] this jesus has god raised up whereof we
[23:11] are all witnesses
[23:13] it's the same verse
[23:16] still in acts 2
[23:20] how many of you are witnesses what is
[23:22] the status on testigos
[23:25] we have
[23:26] as some of our colored brothers might
[23:28] say can i have a witness
[23:32] what to have a witness you have to be a
[23:34] witness but uh
[23:36] praise the lord jesus christ
[23:38] but watch this next verse
[23:42] and maybe this won't make a
[23:44] total sense right now
[23:48] i thought i understood this verse
[23:51] but as i dug into this on the
[23:54] inoculation of god
[23:58] and immunity
[23:59] i come to find out that the prophet
[24:01] spoke spoke about inoculate inoculation
[24:08] almost a hundred times that is he
[24:10] investors
[24:12] he spoke about it
[24:14] in every way you could think from every
[24:17] angle you could imagine diablo
[24:23] first of all he said when god was going
[24:25] to send this inoculation
[24:29] normally
[24:30] an inoculation they'll use a guinea pig
[24:38] a rat in the laboratory to test him
[24:40] first to see if it's going to work on
[24:42] the rats
[25:12] because why from the time that jesus
[25:14] went down to be baptized to john
[25:20] and the heavens were opened
[25:23] and god said this is my son
[25:26] in
[26:00] especially in order to treat or prevent
[26:03] a disease
[26:08] and then brother bram said as jesus went
[26:10] along in his everyday life
[26:13] jesus
[26:15] as he came up to matthew four
[26:19] and he had received the spirit yeah
[26:22] received
[26:26] the inoculation was going to be tested
[26:28] against the very
[26:30] satan himself
[26:35] and the inoculation health
[26:50] but by
[27:05] true
[27:08] it over and over again
[27:13] then that day came when he was nailed on
[27:15] calvary
[27:18] brother
[27:31] god was testing the inoculation
[27:37] he was testing whether there could truly
[27:39] come an immunity first of the soul
[27:47] where it would resist every evil spirit
[27:52] every thought of unbelief
[27:56] every attribute of fl flesh
[28:00] and it held
[28:13] the inoculation of god
[28:17] was speaking to you and me of love
[28:22] amen and it's here tonight yes
[28:26] do you believe that tonight
[28:35] you know i can get going and then i'll
[28:37] never get to some of this other good
[28:38] stuff here
[28:41] to me it's good not because it's me but
[28:43] because it's the bible
[28:48] let's go to acts chapter 13.
[28:56] verses 32 to 35.
[29:01] this is another scripture that i kind of
[29:03] sort of thought that i understood
[29:10] but you know what the holy spirit just
[29:11] stopped me
[29:14] i forgot to read verse 33
[29:19] of the chapter
[29:23] see i'm just human
[29:26] how many
[29:28] make mistakes every day
[29:31] if you could call this a mistake
[29:33] real quick just put your finger right
[29:36] there just go back to chapter two
[29:38] regress
[29:43] therefore being
[29:45] by the right hand of god exalted
[29:52] comma
[30:06] of the father the promise of the holy
[30:09] ghost
[30:13] i thought that that has
[30:15] was something that had already happened
[30:17] by the time that jesus got to the right
[30:20] hand of the father
[30:25] but as i begin to study the inoculation
[30:30] i understood by the scriptures and the
[30:32] messages
[30:35] that jesus even though he spoke of the
[30:37] holy ghost
[30:40] john chapters 4 through 17
[30:46] how many have read those chapters about
[30:47] the holy ghost
[31:03] he spoke of what would happen when the
[31:06] holy ghost would come
[31:13] but did you know
[31:16] that in order for him to fulfill on what
[31:19] he had spoken
[31:23] he had to overcome death hell and the
[31:26] graves
[31:30] and resurrect
[31:37] and now he had to go to the father
[31:41] he had to ascend to the father
[31:45] if you read the scripture the way it's
[31:47] in its context
[31:49] let's read it again
[31:51] therefore being by the right hand of god
[31:55] exalted
[31:59] notice in spanish it just says it's a
[32:01] it's an exalted but in spanish in
[32:03] english it says being in espanol
[32:08] he had overcome and now he had the right
[32:11] to remain there aviator
[32:18] therefore being by the right hand of god
[32:21] exalted
[32:25] and having received the
[32:28] of the father the promise of the holy
[32:30] ghost
[32:34] he has now shed this forth
[32:37] which you see
[32:40] which means
[33:03] 7 30 8 30 and if i can
[33:05] do it faster i will
[33:22] to breathe upon them
[33:26] he did not breathe upon them before he
[33:29] was glorified
[33:32] glorification but after he was glorified
[33:35] and he came
[33:36] back first there's no book like the book
[33:40] of john that explains
[33:43] explicit every little detail of what
[33:45] happened from the time jesus rose from
[33:48] the dead until the time he went to
[33:49] heaven
[34:05] to play it on marcus this you say you
[34:06] can go to
[34:08] luke 24.
[34:10] and i will just quote to you verse 49
[34:15] where he said
[34:16] now tarry ye there in the city
[34:45] he is glorified
[34:59] we're going to get to that in just a
[35:01] minute
[35:03] and you may say this scripture that i'm
[35:05] giving you the protocol
[35:08] doesn't have anything to do
[35:12] with what happened after the
[35:13] resurrection
[35:23] thank the lord for correcting me on that
[35:25] because i would have left that piece out
[35:26] and
[35:27] i said i was going to read it and then
[35:42] and we declare to you glad tidings how
[35:45] that the promise which was made to the
[35:48] fathers
[35:54] god has fulfilled the same to us
[35:56] to us their children
[36:01] and in that he has raised up jesus again
[36:08] as it is written in the second psalm
[36:14] you are my son
[36:17] this day have i begotten thee
[36:22] and as concerning that he raised him up
[36:24] from the dead
[36:28] now no more to return to corruption
[36:34] he said on this wise
[36:37] i will give you the sure mercies of
[36:40] david
[36:43] wherefore he says also in another psalm
[36:49] you shall not allow your holy one to
[36:52] seek corruption
[36:56] how is it that in the previous verse
[37:01] it says that he would not return to
[37:03] corruption
[37:05] but in the next verse that repeats acts
[37:08] chapter 2.
[37:13] and the psalms
[37:15] that his
[37:17] soul would not be left in hell
[37:31] that there appears to be a contradiction
[37:34] a contradiction
[37:43] because what could have been corrupted
[37:46] in jesus christ
[37:53] i'm not gonna allow my holy one to stay
[37:56] in the grave more than 72 hours
[38:03] three days and three nights amen
[38:06] because his body would begin to corrupt
[38:11] why would god say that
[38:14] if there wasn't a possibility of a
[38:17] cell in his body to corrupt
[38:22] and this is delicate stuff
[38:26] how is it that in our soul
[38:29] we have the holy ghost the name of the
[38:31] spirit the inoculation of the holy
[38:34] spirit
[38:36] but yet in our flesh
[38:39] because of the fall
[38:41] we have corruption
[38:44] and i'm not referring
[39:03] see
[39:04] contrary to the puppy belief of many
[39:07] contrary
[39:09] even in the message
[39:12] that think they understand the virgin
[39:14] birth
[39:17] and i'm not throwing it
[39:19] i used to see it the same way
[39:22] but i had a man
[39:24] by the name of thomas perez
[40:08] it could come
[40:16] [Music]
[40:38] the scripture says that they their
[40:40] pharisees they they rebuked him
[40:49] he says you not yet being 50 years old
[40:54] and you say before abraham was i am it
[40:57] is
[41:00] well he was only 30 years old
[41:04] and he looked like he was 50.
[41:07] he aged
[41:10] one day he leaned up on a rock and he
[41:12] had a headache
[41:15] in the book the prince of the house of
[41:17] david
[41:18] in the liberal
[41:31] so what does it mean then
[41:33] significa
[41:35] here in this verse
[41:38] that he would not return to corruption
[41:45] and i'm going to leave that there right
[41:46] now because you're going to have a lot
[41:47] of questions on that one
[41:51] i'm not going to just leave it there
[41:52] we'll get to it eventually
[41:56] what we're going to find out
[41:58] that it's talking exactly about the same
[42:02] thing
[42:06] that happened
[42:07] when jesus arose from the dead
[42:12] and mary wanted to touch him
[42:16] he said don't touch me
[42:18] and brother tommy says in the message
[42:20] hinder me not he says
[42:24] 1997.
[42:26] he says don't hinder me don't meet us
[42:28] don't
[42:38] i have not yet ascended to my father yes
[42:42] indeed
[42:43] and then he makes this statement
[42:45] jesus was still
[42:47] in the office of a son
[42:52] there was a genealogy you could trace to
[42:55] him
[43:09] yet become
[43:11] the glorified god
[43:15] glorificator
[43:17] don't hinder me
[43:22] and if i don't become transformed
[43:47] and we're not going to finish it tonight
[43:49] i can tell you i've got i've still got a
[43:50] half an hour
[43:52] and i could just run through it
[43:56] but i'm not going to do that but i'm
[43:58] just giving you a picture of where we're
[43:59] going
[44:04] jesus knew jesus
[44:06] that in his humanity
[44:08] there was a capability
[44:12] that he could see corruption
[44:19] that's
[44:20] a
[44:34] then
[44:34] he's our big brother
[44:39] not just in the spiritual sense
[44:43] but in a natural sense
[44:46] now with that said
[44:48] we need this scripture right here for
[44:49] right now
[44:51] and now i want to go back to the last
[44:53] quote we got into the other night
[44:59] the last one
[45:04] and
[45:05] let me get it here i think they've got
[45:06] it up there i gave them the notes
[45:10] it's out of the message god's provided
[45:12] way
[45:16] of i'm going to start at about the
[45:19] middle of
[45:22] paragraph 42 is to not read the whole
[45:24] thing
[45:29] the bible predicts that in the last days
[45:34] i'm in the brother i'm in the paragraph
[45:38] yes let me see where are we at
[45:44] i'm a little further down it's there but
[45:47] it's a lot harder for me to pick it out
[45:49] here than it is just to pick it out on
[45:51] my phone so i'll use my phone
[45:53] the bible predicts that in the last days
[45:55] there would be a germ warfare
[46:10] [Music]
[46:25] how much
[46:26] kind of teachers have we got to be
[46:28] brethren
[46:32] to get the church in order to be in that
[46:35] condition
[46:40] in
[46:40] [Music]
[46:52] significa
[46:54] not when you're born again
[46:58] oh yeah we
[46:59] how many know we start at the bottom of
[47:01] the pyramid
[47:04] justification sanctification the baptism
[47:06] of the holy ghost
[47:08] is
[47:13] amen amen
[47:15] and then it's baptism after baptism
[47:20] all the way to the top of the pyramids
[47:38] where the great seal is on the ground
[47:42] that's the ball brother this is
[47:44] what we're reading here is the goal
[47:48] to reach that goal
[48:02] that we've got to reach that goal
[48:09] i like the way he goes in the next
[48:11] paragraph
[48:14] my arms are sore now
[48:17] somewhere the doctors has punched
[48:19] needles in the doctor
[48:21] to try to inoculate me from yellow fever
[48:23] and so forth
[48:26] i told them i didn't need it
[48:29] but they wouldn't listen to me
[48:33] but i'll tell you what god's going to do
[48:37] god's got a serum
[48:41] and it's called the holy ghost
[48:44] when that serum goes in
[48:50] what the pastor said about the
[48:52] antibacterial
[48:53] antibodies
[48:57] of the the
[48:58] ointment that mary bought that was worth
[49:01] one year's wage
[49:08] i don't have time for it
[49:11] maybe someday the lord will let me go
[49:13] into that
[49:29] how tremendous
[49:31] it's a bomb
[49:35] it's an anointing
[49:38] it's something so precious
[49:43] and when that inoculation goes in
[49:49] it's the holy ghost
[49:54] hallelujah
[49:56] and i remember one time during the 37th
[49:58] flood
[50:01] everybody
[50:03] had to take typhoid shots
[50:08] anybody ever had the typhoid shot
[50:10] okay
[50:39] i've got that shot then go ahead he said
[50:41] you did you well did it make you sick
[50:45] i said no
[50:46] no no it sure didn't no
[50:49] he said when did you get your shots
[51:01] and i said i get one about every hour
[51:06] brother
[51:17] and we finished with this but i wanted
[51:19] you to get this
[51:32] if we can't have faith for divine
[51:34] healing
[52:30] and if he lives in you
[52:32] to such a point
[52:35] that he saturates your soul
[52:38] and your body from the inside out
[52:42] kill every fiber of your being
[52:52] [Music]
[52:57] uh
[53:25] oh now they're going to give us 40
[53:26] percent that we can have in here
[53:31] i mean you heard the news
[53:34] that means we can have 120.
[53:38] oh glory to god
[53:40] oh brother
[53:42] that's not five feet brother
[53:44] or one son
[53:46] that's only three and a half feet long
[53:49] you see you see where will you see
[53:52] yes we should try the social distance
[53:54] still as long as it's possible
[53:58] once we hit 50 it's going to get real
[54:00] hard to do social differences
[54:05] but if we are walking with god
[54:08] and we are doing what
[54:19] we wash our hands and sanitize our hands
[54:20] so many times a day i can't even i can't
[54:22] even remember how many times
[54:27] i'll walk in the garage and take off my
[54:29] shoes before i go in
[54:31] go back out and spray them and wipe them
[54:34] off
[54:36] go in the
[54:50] when something
[55:06] or infringe on the rights of anybody
[55:08] else
[55:10] we are just going to go up a little
[55:12] higher
[55:18] god knew this was coming
[55:24] he allowed it
[55:26] it's his foreknowledge
[55:30] how many believe that went to screen
[55:32] brother i can't believe that this is the
[55:34] devil
[55:36] yeah it was also the devil when lucifer
[55:38] got in the serpent with god
[55:46] and brought lucifer to judgment
[55:50] for the sin that began in heaven
[55:54] because sin never started on earth
[56:00] and god said
[56:13] god is saying of you and me
[56:23] these sicknesses
[56:26] to judgment
[56:42] then
[56:45] [Applause]
[56:48] i was in a ministerial meeting with
[56:50] brother tommy
[56:54] and this is not in the notes
[57:13] every so many feet
[57:17] going across this water
[57:21] i take a step
[57:24] and then i'll take a step to another
[57:26] pastor
[57:27] he said
[57:28] can you follow
[57:30] me
[57:34] then he said okay
[57:36] same scene
[57:38] but the
[57:46] he says and now when i step
[57:50] where he tells me to step well put my
[57:52] paddle
[58:03] he goes can you still follow
[58:20] goes now we're standing on the edge of
[58:22] this river
[58:25] and there are no rocks in the water you
[58:27] know
[58:31] he goes
[58:32] as the lord tells me to step
[58:48] well i mean i i i was shocked
[58:52] that was my first minister's meeting
[58:56] i had just moved to silver
[58:59] prior to that and i was called
[59:02] i was all beat up i was in a trauma just
[59:06] i remember one of the first messages i
[59:08] ever heard was trauma
[59:11] and i was in such a trauma
[59:15] trauma comes when you get a blow after
[59:16] blowing and it causes a bruise and
[59:19] you you go into a trauma
[59:23] and then i don't know how many a week or
[59:25] two went by and he asked me to preach
[59:30] he asked me
[59:34] [Music]
[59:37] i would rather listen to your the
[59:39] ministers that are already here
[59:42] i i i
[59:44] i just don't feel like i'm in too good
[59:47] of shape
[59:50] he says you just do what i ask you to do
[59:55] and everything will be okay
[59:57] i did eloise
[1:00:00] and here we are
[1:00:02] in 2020.
[1:00:05] worshiping the living god
[1:00:09] how many are happy tonight
[1:00:12] amen amen
[1:00:14] let's go to our next quote
[1:00:19] in the message
[1:00:23] he cares
[1:00:52] amen
[1:00:56] and i want to go back i'm going to go
[1:00:58] down here
[1:01:00] yeah let's just start at 105.
[1:01:04] what makes disease come to the human
[1:01:07] body because bengal
[1:01:11] how many no and the pastor had mentioned
[1:01:12] this to me the other day
[1:01:16] that your immune system generally
[1:01:17] speaking is in your gut
[1:01:22] again
[1:01:24] and if you have problems there then
[1:01:26] there's problems with your immune system
[1:01:31] and actually with a little bit of study
[1:01:32] i found out that over 70 of the cells
[1:01:38] that make up the immune system the
[1:01:40] components
[1:01:42] are in the guts
[1:01:47] and i've had a lot of problems there
[1:01:49] that's why it's tremendous to me how god
[1:01:51] stopped this thing that hit us
[1:01:56] because i don't have the best immune
[1:01:58] system in the world because you don't
[1:01:59] think
[1:02:00] it's
[1:02:00] always had problems in the gut
[1:02:04] but i also believe
[1:02:06] that i will restore
[1:02:09] all things in your restoration
[1:02:17] so
[1:02:18] let's take care of our gut
[1:02:22] gastronomica
[1:02:25] believe me i've changed my eating though
[1:02:29] what i eat and how much i ate
[1:02:32] and i just pray that the lord really
[1:02:34] changes me and it's not just for a
[1:02:37] little while
[1:02:40] momentum
[1:02:41] feels so much better than even before
[1:02:44] that stupid plague hit us
[1:02:53] god is so good how about how do you feel
[1:02:56] that god has healed you
[1:02:59] i am told by precious doctor friend of
[1:03:01] mine
[1:03:02] that i wouldn't want to call his name
[1:03:04] right now
[1:03:08] but his very fine brother reading to me
[1:03:11] recently out of the medical journal
[1:03:17] a book in his office where he keeps all
[1:03:20] these fine books
[1:03:24] and the latest stuff on medicine
[1:03:28] it is weakness
[1:03:31] you notice anybody that's real you say
[1:03:34] your body runs down
[1:03:40] you take a cold right quick
[1:03:44] what is it yes
[1:03:46] it is the weakness of your body that
[1:03:49] produces a mucus out of your glands it
[1:03:52] is
[1:03:58] amen
[1:03:59] and in that the cold germ beds itself
[1:04:02] and you got a cold yeah
[1:04:07] but if that body was strong
[1:04:10] it would throw
[1:04:24] he was immune from disease
[1:04:28] oh my
[1:04:29] when he created adam
[1:04:32] he was immune
[1:04:36] he was immune from any disease
[1:04:52] that took a man away from god
[1:04:56] and it's still
[1:04:58] talk
[1:04:59] taking it
[1:05:06] let's talk about adam abdemus
[1:05:12] now the scripture says in first
[1:05:13] corinthians 15 45 we won't turn there
[1:05:19] my time is
[1:05:20] rapidly fleeing
[1:05:25] that
[1:05:25] the first
[1:05:27] man the first adam
[1:05:31] the first
[1:05:33] man adam was made
[1:05:49] why was it alive
[1:05:51] because he was inoculated
[1:05:55] he had the holy spirit
[1:05:58] you say yes yes before the fall he had
[1:06:00] the holy spirit
[1:06:05] but that holy spirit had such a control
[1:06:07] of him
[1:06:10] now this is before the fall
[1:06:14] and none of the cells of his body had
[1:06:16] been corrupt
[1:06:20] he had been formed out of the dust of
[1:06:23] the earth
[1:06:26] sickness could not get in him even if it
[1:06:29] tried
[1:06:30] left
[1:06:32] because he had a perfectly formed body
[1:06:36] out of the dust of the earth
[1:06:42] and he had a living soul
[1:07:54] well i'm 66. i think was just anti-seize
[1:07:57] so if i make it to 80 i'll be doing
[1:07:59] awesome
[1:08:05] if i make a cast idiot the lord
[1:08:06] cherished
[1:08:20] i can just see brother benjamin say i'm
[1:08:22] just tired of this old pest house
[1:08:28] and hear our founding pastor say
[1:08:31] oh
[1:08:32] i'm so tired of this testimony
[1:08:48] that adam was glorified
[1:09:06] he had a spirit in him that was
[1:09:07] glorified
[1:09:10] but if he would have been glorified in
[1:09:12] other words his spiritual body
[1:09:16] is a celestial body
[1:09:32] is malcolm x and broadband says it in
[1:09:34] plain english
[1:09:40] but what he was separated from the
[1:09:42] theophany
[1:09:44] he was placed in human flesh
[1:09:59] these are things that we can study more
[1:10:01] and more
[1:10:04] now let's read verse 54 of the same
[1:10:06] chapter
[1:10:11] so when this corruptable shall have put
[1:10:14] on incorruption
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:11:11] well that's that's an easy one right
[1:11:12] it's fascinating
[1:11:14] jesus christ our savior christopher
[1:11:17] salvador when he prayed for the lepers
[1:11:20] when he touched the lepers
[1:11:23] that was a contagious disease what
[1:11:44] and as long as god wanted him on earth
[1:11:48] there was nothing satan could do about
[1:11:51] it
[1:12:04] was there any story in the book of acts
[1:12:10] that showed somebody was immune
[1:12:14] to a sickness
[1:12:19] or to a poison
[1:12:29] and it was a storm came up
[1:12:33] and the angel of the lord stood there
[1:12:34] and told him you won't lose one man
[1:12:38] and then when they got to lance
[1:12:41] they were standing at this fire
[1:12:45] and the scripture says a viper
[1:12:47] jumped up and did
[1:13:58] i haven't found it
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:28] in the late 1890s
[1:14:36] have you ever wondered how brother
[1:14:38] brennan got to know ff bosworth
[1:14:57] in chicago illinois in chicago illinois
[1:15:00] and they were very radical you got
[1:15:01] together some of the things you would
[1:15:03] you would question
[1:15:07] they didn't believe in doctors we
[1:15:08] believe in doctors
[1:15:10] they had these rooms
[1:15:12] they still have some there in in chicago
[1:15:15] are you in chicago they have some in
[1:15:17] washington
[1:15:19] and they call them healing rooms
[1:15:30] and many people person after person was
[1:15:33] healed
[1:15:50] that
[1:16:04] two minutes down to two minutes
[1:16:08] and
[1:16:11] brother ben said
[1:16:14] alexander dalby died one day
[1:16:18] though alexander died one day alexander
[1:16:20] muriel
[1:16:21] and i was born the next day
[1:16:25] and exactly according to the prophecy
[1:16:27] that dali prophesied
[1:16:31] 40 years later
[1:17:00] the lord sent him to south africa
[1:17:04] africa
[1:17:06] and the bubonic plague
[1:17:12] was killing people by the hundreds
[1:17:16] they didn't have what we have today
[1:17:18] brother david
[1:17:19] look at the name of zoe all the help
[1:17:24] these machines these respirators
[1:17:28] they didn't have any of that
[1:17:31] and people were laying in the streets
[1:17:37] and brother leki goes to those that are
[1:17:39] in charge and says
[1:17:42] i
[1:17:55] you're signing your own death warrant
[1:17:59] he says
[1:18:03] he said the world if that plague touches
[1:18:06] me
[1:18:09] it will die
[1:18:11] [Applause]
[1:18:22] in christ jesus christ
[1:18:38] so you want to go and help bury the dead
[1:18:40] with no protection
[1:18:45] well let's do the test first
[1:18:48] there's a dead body there
[1:18:51] gross right
[1:18:52] i'll go
[1:19:05] and they put it on his hands
[1:19:10] and put it on his hands
[1:19:19] and they watched it died
[1:20:01] his followers
[1:20:31] oh my that's getting awful white up here
[1:20:35] it's getting very milky looking here
[1:20:40] how is it that
[1:20:42] they didn't even have the revelation
[1:21:26] he follows
[1:21:34] oh no
[1:21:38] you know that that last
[1:21:40] video
[1:21:47] that night after
[1:21:49] that the pastor played that or the day i
[1:21:52] can't remember it was day or night
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:21:56] i called brother caleb and i said do you
[1:21:58] have that
[1:21:59] little video
[1:22:01] legend
[1:22:03] i go nothing against brother henry he
[1:22:04] did the best he could no no
[1:22:06] henry
[1:22:08] diego speaking and he was speaking on
[1:22:10] top of him and it was just
[1:22:14] just barely understandable i don't know
[1:22:16] how many of you understood that
[1:22:19] and that same night
[1:22:21] or the same day when he sent it to me
[1:22:25] i watched it very carefully for two
[1:22:27] times
[1:22:30] and i noticed him every day that when he
[1:22:33] got to the part because
[1:22:36] he says why
[1:22:37] they were those demons were having a
[1:22:39] meeting
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:49] allergies
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:23:04] then there was the famous kovit there
[1:23:06] lugos
[1:23:08] ezra pastor mentioned the other day
[1:23:11] he was not a very big guy
[1:23:15] but the big daddy of a moth
[1:23:31] under the name are presented themselves
[1:23:33] as cove
[1:23:37] what else filthy lie of the devil
[1:23:41] that's why i talk to different people
[1:23:44] and they would have symptoms and they
[1:23:45] want to go to the doctor he
[1:24:01] but the most tremendous thing about that
[1:24:03] vision
[1:24:06] what i feared the most
[1:24:08] was that the people
[1:24:13] would lose our leadership
[1:24:20] sorry i've already gone over time five
[1:24:22] minutes
[1:24:24] but this is not brother jimmy now
[1:24:26] jimmy no no this isn't brother jimmy
[1:24:30] how could we lose our leadership
[1:24:34] when we let that spirit of fear get on
[1:24:36] us
[1:24:39] and we're looking around us we're
[1:24:41] looking behind us
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:26:06] to not return to corruption
[1:26:10] or not seek corruption
[1:26:14] another time when you see it
[1:26:18] it is going to do something to you but
[1:26:20] i'll
[1:26:34] by the message of the hour
[1:26:36] leading his home
[1:26:39] just
[1:26:40] the enemy trying to block us
[1:26:44] from that supernatural dimension
[1:27:03] [Music]
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:15] he said
[1:27:16] you'll die
[1:27:19] but death will be such a short thing
[1:27:26] that he'll quicken
[1:27:29] change your body
[1:27:32] the glorification will come love
[1:27:34] glorification
[1:27:36] people say well if it's going to come
[1:27:37] then i'll just wait for it
[1:27:40] no no no no then you hear what our
[1:27:42] pastor said sunday
[1:27:57] where you take one step towards the
[1:28:00] theophany
[1:28:03] that theophany i'll take a step towards
[1:28:05] you
[1:28:07] yes we'll hit you
[1:28:10] but before you can drop to the ground
[1:28:21] and satan thought
[1:28:23] he was going to block us
[1:28:25] god bless
[1:28:26] you bendigo
