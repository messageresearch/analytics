Aaron as brother Aaron comes on out god bless you guys [Applause] how did you all get in my lab you have to have special access to get in my lab what's going on here I need some answers now how did you get in my lab anybody it was open I was in the back and I just heard this singing of some children so I thought I'd come in to see what it was all about so you see my time machine it broke out I was on my way to see a miracle being done but I did not make it so I guess what you all like to help me we're going to be some time travelers today is that okay who wants to time travel anybody we're going to see the first miracle that Jesus ever did who can tell me that miracle speak you're a very smart little lad very smart very wise yes yes okay so who can tell me what a miracle is Wow straight from the dictionary stand up and share speak into my mic tell everybody I supernatural work of God that's right and so what we're going to do is I could show you but I probably blow my face off because I'm not actually I went to Vista college I'm not really certified so we're going to go straight to the source is that okay so a miracle is something you're creating something that did not exist before and we're going to go to the very greatest source that I know of I've worked in the laboratory of God for many years and I've got this in gray miracles and I've tried to replicate them but they didn't go too well so my greatest experience is time traveling and as I go to the time travel I experience and I get to see and I meet new people and I'm able to go back and forth and I it's just a great time so what we're gonna do is we're going to go on my time machine I don't know if it's going to work or not it takes faith to activate it anybody have faith okay oh great because we're gonna need it all because my faith meter for some reason it didn't work and so we're going to put our faith in action and we're going to get in this great time machine and we're going to travel back to a wedding so we got to get dressed you all look okay but in that day they weren't dressed like your dress today they're probably laughing and we don't want that so we're going to go in our lab we're going to get dressed and you're going to go through the time of Jesus is that okay all right let me see if I can get this thing started here that's remember my password hmm was it stinky socks no was it blue blue red green no there's no green okay let's activate this thing blue blue come on and get nothing okay I got a better idea whoever wants to come in line up but in order to enter the time machine you have to tell me a miracle that Jesus has done for you is that okay oh okay so just share with us a little miracle that God has done for you and maybe this meter will start to raise up sound good okay face them IRA you don't have to look at me I'm ugly she forgot what a miracle his brother come tell her what a miracle is whether James mr. Webster himself come on tell her what a miracle is she needs your help okay like a testimony short thing it can be short long not too long because we got to get out pretty short oh just by you grabbing the mic it's all the speed you've got the word just say I love Jesus oh now this one doesn't working yeah what do we do when technology fails testing okay I want to thank Jesus because once my two sisters they had to get their tonsils out and it was really scary for me but I'm so glad that they got they got keep them safe hey man go ahead if they're in the time machine and just go through the back and take a right to the wall take a right be careful you might walk through the wall with that kind of faith who's next okay Charlie go ahead tell us a little testimonial I love jesus because one time I got very sick and I had to get my appendix out Oh gracious go ahead enter in there we go we're about to take off pretty soon I have some young men brave young men tell us something I love Jesus because everything I've been through and everything I done he forgives me for and he's always there for me anybody else want to go anybody come on buddy come line up anybody all I think the lot because um me and my dad and my brother Reuben we were in a car and the car hit her car but dinged alerted it wasn't a bad crash that's right thank you go ahead enter him buddy that is another one I think the Lord for giving me because I per fate in my eardrum and thank the Lord because um I don't need hearing gapes or surgery thank you I think the Lord for forget get getting me through

good so if you didn't know the first miracle Jesus ever did was he turned the water into wine they were at the party and everybody was having a good time and the mother of Jesus she came to she came to Jesus and she said we have run out of wine and he wasn't panicked but he waited till the appointed time and he turned the water into wine and all was good and he took something that was nothing and he filled it and it was plenty and it was good for everybody and I hope you all learned something today did everybody learn that's great so I've got to get out of here I got to be back I've got to go
