laying on my bed established pouring my heart out to the lord rigando mi corazon al senora saying you know lord if you get me out of this i will dedicate my life to you i've never been so sincere in my life than i was that day in those six months when i got out of jail they released me i had a bunch of court dates i didn't understand why they let me out because with my priors i i knew i was looking at at least 10 to 15 years in prison and when i got out i had a bunch of court dates and i started dedicating my devoting myself to to the lord every day i quit doing social media and just really focusing on god and right when i thought that that things were going to get worse god intervened a day of one of my court dates i i was having trouble because i had a call in and undiagnosed and i was having trouble just getting into the courtroom so i uh i kept on calling and i and i was just so worked up and i was just like ready to give up and all of a sudden just like the presence of the presence of the lord just came and just changed the whole atmosphere atmosphere and i thought you know if if the devil is fighting me hello mr i must be doing something right or god must be working so a long story short they wind up dismissing all my cases de cortes not only that but you know there's more i have to testify about no solo i i was just going through through life and all this was just so amazing and just and i i couldn't thank god enough and then god bless me more working at one of the brother's houses he was helping me out with some work and i had i've been having trouble finding you know an income or steady income and i would i've just been praying to the lord lord that i need to be able to support my family and and could you help me out some way or send me a sign or something so i was at my storage and then all of a sudden my uh i went to go open my door and i couldn't open it up all the way it just like got stuck almost a long story short the guy didn't know what he was doing when we were trying to fix the door and i winded up giving him a hand and large story [Music] and it came about that he didn't have a maintenance man he was just a manager [Music] and i knew it was god working and the guy says oh well our old maintenance man named daniel um isn't working with us no more questions [Music] so in the back of my head i started praying i

him tonight how many young people are excited to be here tonight how many young people are exhausted tonight had an awesome time so far man i watched you guys climb that mountain and man you guys did an amazing job give yourselves a round of applause i'm going to pray that my voice holds up long enough to get through this sermon because i kept screaming come on team 10. all right guys let's get started tonight first corinthians chapter 13. when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now go ahead i'm sorry cuando nino alla for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known as and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is so i was i was watching you guys today and and believe it or not i learned an incredible amount from you guys as i watched this group of young people today i saw something amazing happening and i watched a group of a hundred individuals the cn individuals become groups of ten singulars singularis and then those ten singulars enes dies in gold and i've had this thought in my mind over the last few months as i study that word and i look into that word that word is always prefaced with another word they're always in harmony in one accord and unaccurate and and i wonder to myself what where is this in donde esta este en you know we hear many times escuchamos munchas vesses that the bride of jesus christ will be in such a harmony but yet day to day we have trouble getting along one with another how do i get along with my brother in this flash i don't always see eye to eye with brother noah so how can it be that we're supposed to be in harmony what what do we have to do get the nemos and i watched you guys today and i watched you guys start off as different teams and you started off this morning as individuals but by the time you made it to the top of the mountain there was one group lord what is this place and i and i started to to to think about this and i realized that this harmony that we have to find is not a harmony of flesh so when you look at one another you're going to have petty differences then you're going to have i don't like your shoes no my gustanto zapatos i don't like your shirt gusta you called me smelly me i called you harry you're [Music] and that secret lies in god's word because you find out that god provided a certain place and that place is nothing more es than the holy spirit of god that comforter that he left behind mean absolutely nothing no significant it's a place where if you like the cowboys and i like the rams it doesn't matter in one it is something that you have never experienced before [Music] but that's many times what we lack guys we lack the ability to get to that place and we think that coming to church is the one place but that doesn't matter because that one place that's provided god's provided place of worship and it's not four walls of a building where he chose to dwell where he chose to come and meet each and every one of you you came to camp this weekend and this weekend estefinda semana you have had an opportunity for a one-on-one appointment with nothing more than the lord jesus christ so if you ever wanted to meet him si en cualquier come into this place with the people that are here and meet the person of the lord jesus christ because he waits for you there i'm reminded of a story that my pastor said a few months ago and in this story it went over my head i'll be honest at first because it seemed like such a simple story and the pastor simply said this he said you know it's okay it's okay for us to a lot of times listen to tapes of brother branham and it's okay for us to a lot of times listen to the bible in audiobook form in form of the audio but there is nothing like nada when you read the words on the page and i didn't understand it i didn't get it no no no but i had an experience and one day i had a choice i was going to listen to brother branham's message and i said you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna take my pastor's advice and i began to read and i began to hear my own voice in my head how many hears your voice in your head when you read cuantro cuantos escuchas centro de si cuando len but all of a sudden but and the finisher and it wasn't my voice anymore because i found harmony harmony i found that place and contrast and all of the sudden me and him were having a meeting and he's speaking to me and i'm speaking to him and i'm in harmony but it's not my voice a man fully surrendered to god unbreakable authority [Music] he continues on what happens when two omnipotents meet he says omnipotence come together but we can't do there's a way to destroy the and a lot of times we approach mountain killing and giant killing munchas from a mental standpoint the una perspectiva mental we think that if we just say to my mountain removed and cast into the sea uh that it's just like magic entonces but god's word is not magic god's word is purposeful and every word that we utter from our mouths must you must be in his spirit and when you get in his spirit when the entrance you're gonna find a place encontra lugar where he waits there and when you and him unite us it will then produce the power produced to move your mountain but i want you to know your question that god's word doesn't stop there god's word covers all the bases it covers all the ends uh calafine first corinthians 13 2 tells us and though i have the gift of prophecy and i understand all the mysteries los montes but if i have not charity i no tengo amor i must say that again but if i have not loved hinotengo that's why when you capped your pyramid today we said the greatest of these is love it's the divine love of the lord christ and instead of a hundred individuals we find a group in the body of the lord jesus christ in one place is to where two omnipotents can meet under those it's as real as the person sitting next i don't care if satan tells you i don't care if satan tells you well you have no value i don't care if satan tells you kill yourself i don't care tells you you have depression tells you you've got anxiety can you find that place when you find it none of those things will matter anymore because you will come face to face with your creator who made you beautiful the talmud that he came from glory el we know the gloria he died on a cross he said i'd die for each and every one who else wants it and when two omnipotents meet juan dos encuentan dos omnipotentes it produces a power bro but that's why we don't get the results that we look for many times results because we don't get in god's provided place of worship we don't spend enough time there no no you gotta put away the girlfriend you gotta put aside the boyfriend why because you really don't have any business going for a boy or a girl if you haven't figured out how to love the lord jesus christ then you don't have love [Applause] [Music] put it away you met the challenge of the mountain today in control can you meet the challenge that was given to you and i'm here to tell you young people you are more than capable each and every one of you you are more than able to take your mountains there is no devil in hell no diablo that can stop you from taking this mountain you just have to take it's not there to be mean and put a hardship in your life it's there for you to take the mountains so that you will know beyond the shadow of a doubt that's what made caleb so tremendous he wasn't afraid of any mountains we are able to go come on who can stand up who could say we are able to we are able we are able to we are able [Applause] god bless you yes uh god bless you thank you uh first of all you know i'd like to thank god for giving me the privilege to be here brother caleb brother tommy and we just uh we're just happy to be here i want if you would just open up our bibles yes amen amen joshua 14 verse 11 reads like this as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain whereof the lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffer the violence and the violet take it by force supreme you know [Music] and uh you know i i didn't like i didn't like to lose you know they always had to sit me out on the bench because i was yelling at everybody because they we weren't winning really can't help very much you know when you have a bad attitude on the bench you know i'm still uh i'm still screaming you know because i i don't like to lose you know and i think if you're here this uh this evening i believe you're still winning you know i it's one thing that that i enjoy [Music] i believe how many winners do we have here [Music] that's why i believe that i'm here he's the goat he's the greatest of all time you know and with him you know we won't lose no family you know and and just going back to the scripture you know we uh we look at uh you know caleb yeah i love talking about caleb and uh you know we we understand that that he goes there you know he goes out he's he's already spied this mountain now you know he's he's you know he sized it up uh you know i don't know about you no said you stand uh well that was one time you know we went to uh colorado springs colorado springs and uh we went to this place you know that they called the the incline she was like you know are we are we gonna go all the way up and uh you know i don't know if she remembers but i told her uh you know i didn't come here uh to not make it you know and i think i think that's how the attitude we should have you know when we decide to live for jesus christ you know i i believe that one hundred percent you know that we don't have to settle oh for losing that you know i i i don't like it i mean and then you know we won't lose we got to have a good attitude you know i will be winners amen amen i remember sizing up that mountain i looked up at it and i was like you know i i i have enough you know i'm i'm gonna make it now what are you saying you know and but uh you know many times there is a time which is this is when we go to places uh you know we just go in and we we sightsee you know we're just we're just sightseeing and there's nothing wrong with sightseeing just gets a little boring you know you decide to go sides but you know the christian walk it shouldn't be that way you know that's why many times you know where we're so we're so we're it's like we're statues one time he said the holy ghost it's not a monument oh the holy ghost oh it's a movement you know and he's taking us he's uh [Applause] amen amen i want to read a quote from brother branham he says he says now the one principle of us being here jesus is trying to help you he says and the only way that i know christian friends christian to help you is to get your faith amen amen he says if you can only see that it's god's will to do these things and he will certainly lead you into deeper depths and higher heights if you just trust him and he says this he says don't be satisfied with your fire built here he says let's build it a little further up the road tonight he says never build it in the same [Music] what we don't understand we gotta move forward yes this was the same place where moses had his experiences it was mount rebel mountain rap and mount sinai are the same era so you know you may have had experience you know a while back and that's okay but you know after you know after he delivers the people of israel israel he wants he wants to take him even further he wants to take him higher so he takes him to the foot of mount sinai and he's gonna reveal himself he's going to show him the fire that's that's what he and he descends you know and we know if you read exodus 19 verse 9. [Music] he says he would reveal himself in a cloud of smoke that's that's what he does believe he did that in this in our time and the bible tells us the foundation he wants to tighten up the [Music] now you may be like well what's what's what was that all about that's what the bible says though i'm going to read it again here [Music] [Music] that's what it is it's a holy that's because we're not gonna win this foreign i i i just want to read a quote from brother branagh because we see that in exodus 19. at the bottom of mount sinai that the lord wants to reveal himself wants to give him a revelation [Music] hey man i'm in brother branham says this is though he says now the power of revelation [Applause] it brings stimulation to the believer this is for the power of wine oh two simulations it's a stimulation of satisfaction satisfaction the stimulation that it's vindicated it's called in the scripture as we want wise you see the i believe that that's what the lord said he wants to do this evening he wants to reveal himself and when [Music] [Music] i saw this young man back there yesterday you know the man he was stimulating he was going yeah he was praising god it didn't matter what they said he was just loose [Music] and that yes so it's why the people of israel were delivered yes amen amen continue reading i just want to go back to caleb for a moment i have i have judah with me you know and i was tribe that caleb was with that was his tribe uh but as we uh continue i believe that that's something that caleb had [Music] and these grapes were not just any kind of grapes oh you know they make wine oh from grapes i believe [Music] you know maybe those people i met this guy is crazy this guy is drunk he is out of his mouth but he wasn't he just got a revelation that's oh [Music] he has done something and i told him that nobody else can do it man you'll fall down [Music] [Music] yo there's a lot of smoke but there ain't no fire in fuego that mountain yes and when the lord descended oh smoke and it had oh they were as good as [Music] [Music] i i just enjoyed it [Music] they were around the house they were gone i just go outside starlight stuff [Music] that attracts the people of god [Applause] [Music] [Music] there's just so much here i want to go to jude 1. it says beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints you know i don't know about you don't send your step but i want to be a contender i want to be a contender we got too much pretenders i won't just get bread at the end we got too much pretending we'll just pretend there's too much people that pretend to be who just kept it they said i'll go so much impersonation i said this in fort collins he came for colin [Music] [Music] it starts [Music] that's what i believe is [Music] give it everything i just want to go back to matthew 11 12. this is this and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffered violence and the violence take you by forces what caleb had okay it was his god gave it to him he said let's take it let's go possess you're not going to let everybody just just just strip it from you you know i mean the youth i'll guarantee you if somebody come to try and take your phone i bet you you'd fight for it you is [Music] and if you touch me there won't be [Music] that's right lebron some of the meanings are significant united unitos juntos bound by a common bond a [Music] he wanted fellowship forward [Music] could you give me some peace give me that it's mine and you know what is when you have that relationship oh [Applause] why we have to get violent [Music] [Music] [Music] and i believe that that's the same thing today with every son or daughter of god kind of we gotta get violence oh there's a lot of times we're like i don't deserve it i don't deserve it because these are my rides i surrendered those rights a long time ago i surrendered them a long time ago i don't deserve this i'm violently in a much more glorious way [Music] [Music] but i i'm waiting for that day the restoration [Music] i believe but if i were to not see it if i were to not see it with these own eyes young man young lady you take this message you take [Music] if you can receive it the altar is open you can talk it over with him the lord bless you live so [Music] when peace like a river i take it my way like sees [Applause] [Music] has
