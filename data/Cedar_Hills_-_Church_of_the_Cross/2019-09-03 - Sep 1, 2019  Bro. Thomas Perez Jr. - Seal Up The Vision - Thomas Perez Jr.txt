order to be able to help us but up with a regular nose but I do believe this through your career that a dream does not just stay a dream kills when you know secure simplemente OS when you I believe that a dream interpreted joke real kills when you interpreter becomes a vision Jake as the rebus you so then as long as your dream remains a dream interest is loose when you / - concern you never produced the product Google are pros here because a dream is in the heavens for cues for yourself but a vision una be serious the tangible part of guys - you realize but if the proposition to either that's why people don't advance for this is killer hit they know unless they become what are you gonna stay out now I want you to notice in the context because they become dreamers what are you gonna say Lou yellow days tomorrow I'm gonna be better and you know what you serve me well at least I'm not as bad as I used to be that's a dream it has not become the interpretation matter feel um tangible you wanna go certain chiefly in su vida that's why when when the inauguration is given to us what is quandary never seen a sign me up so our Peter put in a postal proposal bezel he tells us that your young men shall see visions physical hone a bit on beef you and your old men shall dream dreams you know sandals on your and swinging I believe with all my heart took it open pull I have a hat dream

tangible part of God in my life apart attentively did you see me neither if I don't let the Word of God become a reality you know for me to get up a leverage again already I always be a dream pretty

dream land in a community release wing you because they were believing on to por que están cayendo hacia but when the vision they require at least when projected the visions of predict or he'll produce the person he grace produced elaborate lies was done away ways for a producer come because now you had heaven dispute of the dream dance when you that's why there's a man great a great a man of the civil rights movement alright yo se que un hombre que el movimiento los derechos Aviles he is Martin Luther King jr. wake is Martin Luther King jr. yes his thing was I have a dream tingles for

dream no tiene for you he's got a vision you do not be serious power couple it's Belarus the real thing that has happened to us is a career in television it's the let me shoot now when you look at life order front of the mirror la Vida and you look at at just and I and I believe in dreams I want you to understand that you are it comes into reality you guys are literally and then you never know what God wants you to do who they really are intersted okay let's have a look at your skate acoustic I want us to put for title this morning people normally people on esta manana seal up the vision figure la vision what is it to seal up the vision yes secure La Vie sure you know that if you study seventy weeks of Daniel so as you say we're not gonna go in there normal Center already but one of the streets for purposes of the visit from Gabriel to Daniel Pinellas sake to police say six to play this unity that the Gabriela Daniel was to seal up the vision and prophecy wait let's take yellowy she only prophecy but I want us to remember and remain there on the vision okay - campus enemies here the Bible says he said Aurelia and the Lord answered me yes in your room I could bestow and said it is right the vision it's creamier vision and make it plain upon table she also didn't listen that he may run that readeth it killed where he could rape a lair of a cook to those that he may run that rid of it kübra it can relate for the vision or a vision is yet for an appointed time a stone put on people up until but at the end little phenom it shall speak and not lie a lot I know me Tina Zoe teri aankhen 30 wait for it it's padilha because it will surely come it will not tarry poor kissy no no we we ourselves nosotros believe that God sent a mighty prophet cream escaped Gilman Dolan boy those who profess not every hand went up so then we got a lot of we ourselves believe God sent a mighty prophet no no screams c'mon don't pose we believe that God sent Jesus Christ graybles can use the bill his degrees to die in our in our place but a morir addressed earlier that was the fulfillment of the vision is very complimentary because the Lamb crucified difficult now the vision come to pass order with you be necessary Malachi 4:5 Malatya squirtle seen Chris sees a vision chrysalis you'd be old I send you accusing me light your the prophet ears and prefer me for the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord this again can be able to relate you have to pass be not to say the problem is a problem is is that many people want to make brother branham's visions a dream can we choose which a person is kidding kidding say like this unitary monogram on for you this is the problem with melikhaya for today it is a prolific amalaki spot Roy they believe that they have they are the understanding of the vision drink it in an addendum into a lovely soon but because they're not doing anything in the vision you know porque no Esther us you know nothing let me see I make the vision of brother branham today as in love each you determine or denim and all dream all soon you will and say in the futures in an Elfa to listen this is gonna happen be okay you watch let me tell you the humidity it's the vision the love you feel does not bring you to the process do look downstairs you are happy of what you're supposed to do to that buddy but will it will stay there while

a dream it's his loose when you is it a dream it says loose when you if it's a dream CSO so it'll never happen Luke a lock on the set because you've made God a God of history or good things so the deals until they studious that was the Ministry of brother branham is - ministerial took the god of history will delay storia and he presented him alive you know present - vivo so that you that are part of the vision today but you think is birth television Oh II can't be the actor of the Seventh Seal we're sailing like electorate except evil Savior now ora many many people say well my family come in Mucha teasing me familia internal not unless you seal up the vision no one else to test a television will I be better say a mejor will I stop smoking butter a former will I stop party but a fierce will I stop drinking but it don't matter no no because to you it's a dream battle stations one of these days it's gonna happen what are these days I'll be better that's a dream this will swing you that's a place called Paradise this is Eluga demo brief but when the person appeared suna Parisi paradise was done away with now you shall be with me dream is when you became the interpretation
