[52:48] they put a ball and chain on him
[52:50] instantly empirically cuz you know
[52:52] nothing look and they put a piece of
[52:53] meat in front of the dog in the piece
[52:55] you know ambassador I can imprint and
[52:57] the dog
[52:57] ran towards that piece of meat yet
[52:59] better forget it president but they did
[53:02] it to to to wear us right before he got

[53:13] but did not on haciendo law and after
[53:15] about two weeks it is personal - the dog
[53:18] no longer went after the piece of meat
[53:20] in fairness 11 tava what is a company so
[53:23] they they took the chain off like

[1:26:28] it's a lugar de Conde see you and if
[1:26:29] you're redeemed there's two things that
[1:26:33] have to have happen in a redeemed but
[1:26:36] there's two things that had to happen
[1:26:39] those courses Kenan camera a contest IDO
[1:26:41] you know what they are right stay
[1:26:43] there's nothing quite as everybody help
[1:26:44] me out here I think things that do that

[1:26:48] let me know those closest to you don't
[1:26:49] give an a contest IDO you must recognize
[1:26:51] they make a trick on us they're what you
[1:26:54] have come out of the chaos and either or
[1:26:57] the donde and then recognize it reca no
[1:26:59] ser what you have gone into I don't the
[1:27:01] entrado
[1:27:04] you can't think like a redeemed person
[1:27:06] no purpose unless you know what you came
[1:27:09] out of minutes and your intention has
[1:27:12] two parts particular result into those
[1:27:14] but I'm coming out
[1:27:15] saliendo and going in in Rondo maybe we
[1:27:20] came out of something but the question
[1:27:22] have you gone into something with this
[1:27:24] region and a theory Dean you'll be able
[1:27:27] to answer but but I came out of this a
[1:27:31] linear time I've come into this in
[1:27:33] Turkey I came from one condition upon
[1:27:36] this and I'm coming into another two
[1:27:38] years
[1:27:38] oh there's a redeemed person that also
[1:27:41] never so not ready me that who those are
[1:27:44] all these points you want to understand
[1:27:47] the rapture is over and over the
[1:27:49] Ghanaian guy still there is why the
[1:27:51] rapture is all about bunt and there they
[1:27:53] came I'm gonna feel good this year so I
[1:27:55] can make it in the rapture
[1:27:56] so Airport a movie understand your
[1:27:57] Pasadena trapped you're a million miles
[1:27:59] from the rapture it does Amelia's
[1:28:01] developed as he never based it upon you
[1:28:03] porque nor me Louis also very mainly
[1:28:05] based it upon his dear son Louis no it's
[1:28:08] week
[1:28:08] upon the perfect sacrifice service that
[1:28:11] can fit superfan or what me and you
[1:28:13] would do with that sacrificed a vamos a
[1:28:15] hacer con ese sacrificio once you do to
[1:28:17] to to notice this now Garrick is
[1:28:19] Nichkhun we are redeemed someone's ready
[1:28:21] middle because we've come out of
[1:28:23] something but Castelli most the alley
[1:28:25] and have gone into something yeah most
[1:28:26] in trouble because you can't go into a
[1:28:28] new condition
[1:28:30] no poison thread I wound up on this you
[1:28:31] unless first you left your old condition
[1:28:33] - kya how is the condition Antigua
[1:28:36] [Music]
[1:28:39] that's why there's a lot of so-called
[1:28:41] Christians but is this game which is
[1:28:43] your mouthpiece tiene oh I came out your
[1:28:45] Stanley are you ready to go in yes then
[1:28:48] these two Pantera have you gone into
[1:28:49] some sample Yantra I'll go and we don't
[1:28:55] go in in no intra most because we're
[1:28:58] afraid forget them emigrate of what them
[1:29:01] kids look at the memo it's more fearful
[1:29:02] to go back to where you came out of it
[1:29:04] must be a metal so today get a son 30
[1:29:06] Santiago what a dirty devil kilowatt and
[1:29:09] will never understand the rapture in
[1:29:13] these points seen there is no spoon toe
[1:29:15] because many come out of something por
[1:29:17] que muchos a little but never go into
[1:29:19] something because the attitude is well
[1:29:23] this is good enough for collective two
[1:29:26] days esto es bastante bueno
[1:29:29] anybody ever thought that I'm I'm pretty
[1:29:33] good now I see what I was this is pretty
[1:29:35] darn good now almost our history you
[1:29:37] know what a horrible attitude kekkei
[1:29:39] touta fear this is not completely what I
[1:29:42] saw it's the most complete a mental Oh
[1:29:44] kevie I've gotten glimpse Amidala for
[1:29:47] Kenya's but there's more to what I saw
[1:29:49] there I'm a smile okay you owe me
[1:29:51] anybody with me this morning more to
[1:29:53] what you've seen
[1:29:54] I'm a San Lucas de esta bien doe and
[1:29:56] because they have this attitude he put
[1:29:58] cotillion is that they stay in limbo and
[1:30:01] their supernatural or their spiritual
[1:30:02] walk second and limbo and suka mean
[1:30:05] opposite well can content that they're
[1:30:07] no longer in Egypt at least content okay
[1:30:09] I understand in a heap tone brother
[1:30:13] Branham says in the message paired a
[1:30:15] paradox a lemon around this day am is in
[1:30:18] my father's house are many men
[1:30:20] like us let me Padre I wish it wasn't so
[1:30:22] I would have told you you know he says
[1:30:24] John 14 and quanta Thursday coming out
[1:30:27] and going into saliendo entrando better
[1:30:30] puts that I want you to get that John
[1:30:32] 14:1 for the round uses it says coming
[1:30:35] out and going into saliendo in my
[1:30:37] father's house are many mansions and the
[1:30:39] customary law the law that brings us to
[1:30:43] a recognition that we're wrong is little
[1:30:45] a kinesthetic on a circus that most man
[1:30:47] but it's grace that forgives us there is
[1:30:49] not grassy Aquino spared on the law has
[1:30:50] no hope or no redemption the label
[1:30:53] Tina's parents and events it has no
[1:30:55] grace in it like a destiny because law
[1:30:57] only points out that you're a sinner I
[1:31:00] put that is your condition
[1:31:02] yes that's the coldest but grace tells
[1:31:04] you how to get out of it like
[1:31:06] emotionally the law is the policeman la
[1:31:09] ley is love put you in jail opening like
[1:31:12] that one redemption the one who come
[1:31:16] paid your fine friends and out of and
[1:31:20] into in Lusaka omitting that's the
[1:31:24] mentality of a redeemer mentally that he
[1:31:28] never saw just taking you out of your
[1:31:31] condition ten dollars he also saw you
[1:31:34] going into the end of you and run down a
[1:31:37] perfect Redeemer watch as this unfolds

[1:35:23] Paquito challenge Pharaoh
[1:35:34] he heard the cries of his people or
[1:35:37] you'll climb order this is why blue
[1:35:40] there was something though before even
[1:35:42] before that it started well with that
[1:35:47] first Exodus all these nights is why you
[1:35:50] got to hold on to to understand those
[1:35:52] people in the case they were that look
[1:35:54] he said when there are rows of Pharaoh
[1:35:56] the second dose 11:00 tomorrow not Josie

[1:37:05] we can go on and on but but but I want
[1:37:06] you to get the types here goes this plan
[1:37:08] was because to understand the the
[1:37:11] rapture the Exodus didn't get they
[1:37:14] didn't
[1:37:15] Moses fulfilled the coming out part
[1:37:19] Moses completely but he never fulfilled
[1:37:22] the going in part who did that Kenny's
[1:37:26] joy so Joshua did
[1:37:28] Haas well he took them into that land
[1:37:30] legit why it's not theater but it was
[1:37:32] the same captain of the Lord
[1:37:34] dependencies I was doing it all
[1:37:36] Gale está siendo the sex yet second
[1:37:39] Exodus tell me what it was
[1:37:41] Aileen me ayuda
[1:37:52] it says the second Exodus a second oxo
[1:37:54] though Jesus took them from a spiritual
[1:37:57] condition as soon as your do not
[1:37:59] condition is pretty 12 is the coming out
[1:38:01] is the last I leave that into a
[1:38:02] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[1:38:05] want about this - sweet - son come on
[1:38:07] now that's what happened on the day of
[1:38:08] Pentecost from a spiritual condition
[1:38:11] your neck on this unit spiritual baptism
[1:38:13] of the Holy Ghost coming out of
[1:38:16] something invaluable ah making wig
[1:38:21] anyway and we can go on to these things
[1:38:24] understand that it's the same pillar of
[1:38:27] fire belong to the same system what a
[1:38:30] mismos God doing the same thing you
[1:38:32] associate the - one was God above
[1:38:34] nothing wrong was God with the third now
[1:38:39] has become guardians oh let's take let's
[1:38:47] go to the 3rd Exodus now I'm sad to say
[1:38:48] that so what was the third Exodus Jeff
[1:38:50] went there said x2 though what condition
[1:38:52] did you do did we did he bring us out of
[1:38:54] they kick on this your nose to go into
[1:38:56] something yeah and try a legal buddy
[1:39:00] help me out I'll get me at you they
[1:39:02] better just tell you or else I'm not
[1:39:04] gonna finish my message no no Carmen
[1:39:08] sake it's got a few more minutes right
[1:39:11] dr. Hajra
[1:39:13] thank you the third Exodus intersexed
[1:39:16] was to take us from the spiritual
[1:39:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:19] another knows about this more let's be
[1:39:21] right back into the eternal land of the
[1:39:23] millennium and the great hereafter the
[1:39:26] aggressor litera eternal million one
[1:39:28] more time
[1:39:29] the third Exodus was to take us from the
[1:39:32] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:34] Gentiles be right back into the eternal
[1:39:37] land of the millennium and the great
[1:39:39] Hereafter they'll millennial displaced
[1:39:43] thought that's why there are parts of
[1:39:45] the 3rd Exodus the same way with a
[1:39:48] seventh seal there are things that have
[1:39:50] happened
[1:39:51] there's no most au things that are going
[1:39:53] to happen things that have happened
[1:39:55] things that are happening and things
[1:39:56] that will happen here after courses come
[1:39:58] on I quote this into this twist but we
[1:40:00] found out why on the message
[1:40:03] that was brought to us by a prophet what
