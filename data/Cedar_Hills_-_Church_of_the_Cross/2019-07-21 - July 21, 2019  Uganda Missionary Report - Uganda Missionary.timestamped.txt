[36:24] a lot of different ways Constance Alan
[36:26] Bannister man oh it's the unison mr.
[36:28] Munoz Diego he said it was the most
[36:30] supernatural trip that we've ever gone
[36:33] on it's an el viaje
[36:34] so it's objection in general a tenido he
[36:37] was on the trip with us the whole time
[36:39] the second is to Nakano so true story
[36:41] the only buddy everybody believed that
[36:42] or cuantos no training so you believe

[36:48] believes that our knowledge
[36:49] Locklin
[36:50] Ian you know he said he was in spirit he
[36:52] was there with us and his spiritualist
[36:54] to wake and he and he is calling us as
[36:57] we were over there continued maintenance
[36:59] yeah mama stand oh yeah Lena's okay

[37:02] you're gonna see this and this is and
[37:04] and we're just like whenever we see it
[37:06] we're like wow it was yeah Miami - I
[37:09] live in a city where there is not it's
[37:11] not brother Diego no I remember the
[37:13] England that's what the Holy Spirit is
[37:14] doing in his body if you're in so many
[37:20] message churches today that they would
[37:21] they wouldn't know what to do with that
[37:23] oh yeah the most elements we have a more
[37:28] sure word of prophecy and it was not
[37:29] bailout am I say when when the body is
[37:32] functioning the way it's supposed they
[37:34] don't want their critical funciona come
[37:35] over there I know where he when he put
[37:37] the gifts in operation into the church

[37:41] per se or anything less see I don't see
[37:43] where he ever took him out you know
[37:44] where none theless at all why are we so
[37:47] afraid of that what captain in was there
[37:48] is command what is all that

[1:38:07] like I said this would be a little
[1:38:09] different but this is Mount Elgon over

[1:38:13] one of the tallest points in uh in in
[1:38:16] Uganda it's and it's a Montano's muscle
[1:38:20] to say in Uganda we're staying right at
[1:38:22] the base of that it's almost as a Titus
[1:38:26] it's too soon Agumon Oh Tito this is two
[1:38:29] odd things I I was more worried about
[1:38:31] getting a suit coat than anything else
[1:38:32] just on Westbrook well you're going to
[1:38:34] that the thing at the Kings the the
[1:38:36] jacket on come on yeah that picture of
[1:38:39] probably the last time you see me with a
[1:38:41] suit cool here's brother titus ok Stefan
[1:38:45] Oh Tito and they this is called a formal
[1:38:47] man's dress this is a moon with normal
[1:38:50] people just wanted to wear one of those
[1:38:52] things you could you know we were all
[1:38:54] kind of laughing about it a little bit
[1:38:56] though you know it's a men's dress it's
[1:38:59] a
[1:38:59] steal butter but we laughed about it a
[1:39:02] little bit amongst ourselves to see the
[1:39:05] reaction of the Kings and the Prime
[1:39:07] Minister's this is our brother King
[1:39:09] John's home is like a Simon oh the mono
[1:39:11] John they were all walking in getting
[1:39:13] ready for the ceremony
[1:39:14] Kwan's esta el asunto de ceremonia they
[1:39:16] were dressed in their dress like that
[1:39:18] zombie studios de salmonela and when
[1:39:20] they would see us I felt pretty good
[1:39:22] with my brand new suit coat my dad gave
[1:39:24] me you must at the movie ah'm I
[1:39:25] recommend regalo me papa
[1:39:27] so pretty important missing theme
[1:39:28] important everybody look really sharp
[1:39:30] don't windows a view and then we get it
[1:39:32] would see brother Jose Armando Tito he's
[1:39:34] the one they wanted to talk to it I
[1:39:35] didn't care about if you had a good
[1:39:38] career now let Armani suit on it'll test
[1:39:40] that wasn't there
[1:39:42] better look and so in doing and seeing
[1:39:45] that I realized viendo I saw the
[1:39:47] importance of the right identification
[1:39:48] medic went very important scientific
[1:39:50] incorrect
[1:39:51] she's a spoke of a man that had a
[1:39:53] wedding his use of Lord el hombre que
[1:39:55] una boda and as somebody walked into the
[1:39:58] wedding the wedding with with no wedding
[1:40:02] garment become or who not person and

[1:40:19] you know second Estelle Marie but so I
[1:40:21] got to see that now I think brother Tito
[1:40:23] for relating that it wasn't
[1:40:26] understanding in the real form to see to
[1:40:29] actually see it he and earlier though
[1:40:30] the Vettel and the four kings and these
[1:40:32] prime ministers recognized that
[1:40:34] registers those ministers principle it's
[1:40:37] like what's the plan brother Titus is
[1:40:39] called as a plan Amano the man with the
[1:40:41] plan it was that was that was just
[1:40:44] amazing so if you want to just hit play
