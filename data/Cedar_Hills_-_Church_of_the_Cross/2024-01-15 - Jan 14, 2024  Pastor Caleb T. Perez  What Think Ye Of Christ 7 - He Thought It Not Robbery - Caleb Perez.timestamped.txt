[8:58] yay
[9:08] we are on beginning on the fourth
[9:10] chapter of the book of Hebrews the whole
[9:14] book here is just a revelation of Jesus
[9:18] Christ now the thought is if we are on
[9:21] our way to the rest what is the
[9:25] rest where is
[9:28] it is it jining
[9:30] church is it being uh baptized a certain
[9:35] way is it becoming a member of the
[9:38] greatest Church in the city wearing
[9:40] better clothes is it education is it
[9:43] money so we can get work just lay down
[9:47] rest the rest of her life as we call it
[9:49] that's not it listen what the Bible says
[9:52] it is and how we get it for unto
[9:56] us the day then the gospel was preached
[9:59] as well as unto them that God has sent a
[10:02] deliver the Holy Ghost and we're on a
[10:04] road to the promised land now people has
[10:06] made a Creeds and denominations but God
[10:09] Still Remains at our rest as the Holy
[10:12] Ghost oh my bre let me stop here for a
[10:19] minute no matter how much the word is
[10:22] preached how well you like the way it's
[10:25] been preached unless you yourself are a
[10:28] partaker of
[10:30] that it won't do you one bit of
[10:34] good but they failed to get it when they
[10:37] got there because of their
[10:40] unbelief they were turned
[10:42] aside at only 40 miles from where they
[10:47] left in Egypt to the promised land and
[10:50] they were 40 years getting there because
[10:53] of their unbelief now the nth verse get
[10:58] ready
[10:59] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[11:03] people of God a Sabbath keeping to the
[11:08] people of God for
[11:10] he that has entered into his Christ rest
[11:15] he also has ceased from his own works as
[11:20] God did from his on the Sabbath he built
[11:24] the world put the creation on it and
[11:26] went to rest and never come back again
[11:29] to build any more
[11:30] world he does the same
[11:34] today he's Jehovah J Jehovah RI the same
[11:39] yesterday to end forever he never
[11:43] fails that's what you Mar the church
[11:45] they've been taught little old Petty
[11:47] sissified old lady doctrine of some sort
[11:49] run around have soup suppers and card
[11:51] parties no wonder we got a bunch of
[11:54] chaos that we got we don't need
[11:56] children's programs and little soup
[11:58] suppers what we need a rugged old gospel
[12:00] and man of Faith with the sword hanging
[12:03] out there and
[12:04] challenging correct you Church of God
[12:07] the rest of you holess people because
[12:10] you rejected the life you denominated
[12:13] yourself and said we won't believe any
[12:14] more than this God moved right on out
[12:16] and showed you he had people who would
[12:18] follow
[12:19] him what happened to you Pentecostals
[12:22] you had the light God's Tu it away from
[12:25] you the pillar of fire moves on
[12:29] every time the pillar of fire moved the
[12:31] church moved with it and the pillar of
[12:34] fire moves
[12:36] all
[12:38] hallelujah amen I went back I just come

[14:02] daughter now watch that was the third
[14:05] rest to give the first God received it
[14:08] from his
[14:09] word second Israel received it in the
[14:12] law third the church received it as a
[14:16] part of
[14:17] God so if you've never received the Holy
[14:20] Ghost yet you have never entered into
[14:23] God's
[14:24] rest and when you enter into this rest
[14:27] you cease from your own worldly works
[14:29] like God did from
[14:31] his why you're part of God and the

[47:13] excuse I'm G to say it again none of us
[47:15] will have an
[47:18] excuse we will know who exactly who we
[47:23] are that's why we're here right
[47:27] that's why Satan fights us so

[47:35] okay so I hope you get comfortable
[47:38] today first message hey this
[47:42] year so we're going to get right into
[47:45] the
[47:47] word but before before they put it up
[47:49] don't put up the scripture yet let me
[47:51] see how many of you remember the
[47:54] scripture that we've been using
[48:01] Matthew
[48:05] what you got to know the scriptures
[48:08] too Matthew
[48:11] 22 41 and 42 amen you have it you can
[48:16] say
[48:20] Amen while the Pharisees were gathered
[48:23] together Jesus asked them
[48:28] saying what think ye of
[48:33] Christ amen may God add His blessings to
[48:35] the reading of his word you may be
[48:41] seated amen there's a lot of people that
[48:44] are out
[48:46] today God bless them wherever they may
[48:50] be but today we are
[48:54] here we want to speak this on he thought
[48:57] it not
[49:01] robbery and to be able to understand
[49:04] this we want to speak on the subject of
[49:10] identity never was a person like
[49:17] Jesus and I get a witness here today I
[49:20] want to make sure that you're awake and
[49:22] you're alive this
[49:24] morning a person so
[49:28] different that the religious world could
[49:30] not identify
[49:34] him he could not fit or did not fit in
[49:38] any of their
[49:44] boxes the religious world could not
[49:47] identify
[49:50] him because his life was so Supernatural
[49:58] as Jesus is asking them this
[50:02] question without them realizing he is uh
[50:06] he's revealing his
[50:10] identity the identity is in the
[50:14] question what do you think of
[50:18] Christ and the same way it is
[50:22] today the way that he revealed his
[50:24] identity back
[50:28] then is the same way that he is
[50:30] revealing his identity
[50:34] today John chap 3 verse
[50:38] 2 Nicodemus comes to Jesus we know the
[50:43] scripture but he we find here out that
[50:46] he's trying to identify
[50:50] him now now we've heard many messages on
[50:54] identification
[50:57] but but watch at where the holy spirit
[50:59] is leading us
[51:01] today he came to Jesus by night and he
[51:04] says Rabbi so the first thing he knows
[51:06] is is uh he calls him
[51:11] Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher
[51:14] come from
[51:17] God this is about all that he knows
[51:20] about Jesus's identity
[51:23] right calls him Rabbi he calls him a
[51:28] teacher and he said because no man can
[51:31] do the these Miracles that thou doest
[51:35] except God be with
[51:40] him but we know that he was much more
[51:43] than than a rabbi or a
[51:47] teacher and then to top it
[51:50] all as they begin to ask him different
[51:53] questions different people
[51:58] watch what he says then as he's he's
[52:01] identifying
[52:05] himself he goes on to say that I and my
[52:09] father are
[52:14] one he's he's identifying himself
[52:19] more and as soon as he says I and my
[52:22] father are
[52:24] one the Jews take up stones to Stone
[52:30] him they don't like the identity that he
[52:34] is putting
[52:36] forth how many are with
[52:38] me and I can see them
[52:42] saying well if Jesus and his father are
[52:47] one maybe we should try to identify the
[52:54] father right
[52:56] are you with me I think you might be
[52:58] still asleep some of
[53:01] you okay stretch it out a little bit if
[53:04] you're a little sleep stretch it
[53:06] out if your mind is wandering
[53:09] off get it back pinch yourself this
[53:13] morning we're going somewhere good right
[53:16] okay we're going somewhere good here
[53:19] watch now so if you and the father are
[53:21] one then Phillip comes to him
[53:26] and say well then Lord show us the
[53:29] father
[53:30] then in other words identify the father
[53:34] to
[53:37] us and Jesus I can imagine him
[53:40] scratching his head a little
[53:43] bit and he says have I been so long a
[53:48] time with
[53:51] you and yet hast thou not known me
[53:56] he says
[53:58] philli he that hath seen
[54:01] me ha seen the
[54:03] Father for I and the father we are
[54:07] one so how are you really telling me
[54:10] show us the
[54:12] father when I am I am the very
[54:17] identity of the father I am what came
[54:22] forth what do you think of Christ
[54:26] whose son is he this is why identity is
[54:30] so
[54:33] important this is why Satan does
[54:35] everything in his
[54:38] power to try and keep us from our
[54:43] identity if I were to ask you how many
[54:45] of you know your
[54:47] identity how many of you have an
[54:50] identity how many of you know who you
[54:52] are
[54:53] really okay okay let me see your hands I
[54:56] I mean act like you know like believe it
[54:59] okay so so so we have an
[55:02] identity now now now I'm going to say
[55:05] brother brother James James what's your
[55:09] identity who who's who's whose son are
[55:11] you who who are
[55:18] you you're the son of brother Diego but
[55:21] he said I'm also a son of
[55:24] God
[55:25] now if brother brother James did
[55:27] something
[55:29] wrong made a
[55:31] mistake and I would
[55:33] say I thought you said you were brother
[55:36] Diego's
[55:37] son I know something about
[55:41] you would that make him any less of a
[55:44] son to brother
[55:48] Diego so then why are we do we struggle
[55:53] so much when we make a mistake
[55:57] why do we struggle and we say I don't
[55:59] know if I'm a Son of God
[56:03] anymore I don't know if I'm a daughter
[56:05] of God
[56:06] anymore am I speaking to anyone
[56:09] here the first thing we do it's we have
[56:12] to realize there's an attack on our
[56:17] identity sat is doing all that he can to
[56:20] keep us from understanding or knowing
[56:22] our
[56:23] identity
[56:26] he hates it when a person's true
[56:29] identity is
[56:35] revealed do you know why he hates it so
[56:39] much because when Satan and his angels
[56:42] were cast down from
[56:45] heaven the Bible says they lost their
[56:48] first
[56:51] state let me put it another way when
[56:54] they were cast down from
[56:57] heaven they lost their
[57:00] identity now now now we have to
[57:03] understand this because when these
[57:06] Devils or these angels Fallen
[57:09] Angels when they lost their
[57:12] identity they started searching for a
[57:15] new
[57:17] identity this is so very important today
[57:21] to
[57:23] know so here's Satan is cast down with
[57:26] his
[57:27] angels and and now if I were to ask you
[57:30] how many of you know where sin
[57:37] started did it start in the Garden of
[57:40] Eden no no no it started in heaven is
[57:44] that right so if sin started in
[57:47] heaven the only
[57:50] identity that these Fallen Angels could
[57:53] have
[57:56] was they had to attach themselves to the
[57:59] attributes of
[58:02] sin they have no other
[58:05] identity watch how important this is
[58:09] now they lost their
[58:12] identity and that's why Devils hate to
[58:15] be
[58:18] unmasked is that right Devils hate to be
[58:23] exposed
[58:25] they'll cover themselves they'll hide
[58:28] themselves but once they're
[58:31] exposed cast them out is
[58:35] easy that's that's the whole
[58:37] purpose because they're trying to
[58:40] hide under another
[58:43] identity that is not
[58:45] theirs okay now we we understand we're
[58:48] going to understand the the battle and
[58:50] why there's such a
[58:53] battle they have no real
[58:57] identity so they've taken on something
[59:00] that is
[59:04] temporary the very word devil means a
[59:09] Tormentor that's their
[59:12] job is to torment
[59:15] us yes yes or
[59:18] yes now now now now why are we afraid to
[59:21] talk
[59:23] sometimes I was talking to to to a
[59:25] brother I think it was brother Diego
[59:27] that was telling
[59:29] me he had this pain in the front of his
[59:35] leg and and it had been for a few
[59:39] years he said but then one day the holy
[59:43] spirit says why are you living with that
[59:47] pain why are you letting that devil
[59:50] torment
[59:53] you pass it out
[59:55] already he looked down and
[59:59] saidan
[1:00:02] devil you nasty pig that's me saying
[1:00:06] that
[1:00:08] okay and he cast him out he said now now
[1:00:12] he he he kept trying to come
[1:00:15] back but he said I stayed
[1:00:17] firm and after a week of him
[1:00:20] trying he realized he could not come in
[1:00:23] anymore
[1:00:25] he was
[1:00:26] gone why do we not live like that
[1:00:30] there's no reason for him to torment us
[1:00:33] day after day after
[1:00:35] day it's time like we
[1:00:38] heard for us to begin to torment
[1:00:43] them now once again they they lost their
[1:00:46] identity and they're looking around to
[1:00:49] see where they can find an
[1:00:53] identity that's why you have to have
[1:00:55] your guard up all the
[1:00:59] time watch what brother brandham says
[1:01:02] God is the author of
[1:01:05] Life Satan the author of
[1:01:08] death he puts a demon in
[1:01:11] there it's called a
[1:01:13] devil called
[1:01:16] cancer now watch one of these
[1:01:19] Devils loses its
[1:01:22] identity for the only thing can do once
[1:01:26] again is attach himself to an attribute
[1:01:29] of
[1:01:33] sinness it's a
[1:01:34] cancer now watch why why this is so
[1:01:38] tremendous brother Bram says cancer is
[1:01:41] not its
[1:01:45] name I'm GNA say it again this devil of
[1:01:49] cancer cancer is not its
[1:01:53] name medic science just give it a cancer
[1:01:56] or a name
[1:01:58] cancer oh now it's got a little it looks
[1:02:01] like a little identity going on
[1:02:05] huh I'm
[1:02:07] cancer and that cancer always comes with
[1:02:11] fear so when you begin to
[1:02:14] fear what happens that cancer or that
[1:02:19] crab it gets more a hold of
[1:02:22] us and it gets deeper in US
[1:02:25] and then it's harder to cast out but
[1:02:28] when that cancer
[1:02:30] comes and says I'm here and I'm going to
[1:02:33] invade you you have right then a
[1:02:38] chance there's a moment right there that
[1:02:41] you can stop that but if you accept it
[1:02:44] first in your
[1:02:46] mind he'll take your
[1:02:49] body are you with me now once again
[1:02:52] Medical Science called it
[1:02:55] cancer in other words gave it a
[1:02:59] name how tremendous that
[1:03:02] is why even
[1:03:05] Adam gave names to the
[1:03:08] animals I'll leave that with you are you
[1:03:10] getting it it has no
[1:03:13] identity it has no name of
[1:03:16] itself so someone else gives it a
[1:03:20] name that is describing the torment
[1:03:26] oh my well the doctor says you have
[1:03:29] the I like that
[1:03:33] wordan devil the doctor says you have
[1:03:37] this unclean devil has no
[1:03:42] identity but it's coming to you to try
[1:03:45] to find an
[1:03:47] identity I'm building a platform here
[1:03:50] okay just stay with me in this until we
[1:03:53] get this this built
[1:03:56] that word cancer come from the word
[1:03:59] crab and it means that with legs and
[1:04:02] things and and it runs
[1:04:07] out they're given medical
[1:04:10] terms but then that little cancer comes
[1:04:13] in there first it's a
[1:04:16] spirit but then it comes into a
[1:04:18] backsliding
[1:04:22] cell or a bruise
[1:04:25] cell or a cell that's not operating
[1:04:29] right he says that's what happens in a
[1:04:34] church when he gets
[1:04:37] someone failing to operate with the
[1:04:44] church nobody tells me what to
[1:04:47] do my own
[1:04:50] person someone
[1:04:53] failing and pulling
[1:04:55] off and getting
[1:04:59] indifferent that's a cancer in the
[1:05:03] church uh oh uh oh come on now we're
[1:05:06] getting somewhere it's a devil in that
[1:05:10] person and that causes the whole church
[1:05:13] to be sick over
[1:05:17] it the best thing to do is to have a
[1:05:20] spiritual
[1:05:23] operation
[1:05:24] then why would we fear someone or
[1:05:27] something that has no
[1:05:34] identity wait wait wait a
[1:05:38] minute I purpose I wanted to preach this
[1:05:41] this morning I want to run I'm
[1:05:43] telling but man I just feel the rain
[1:05:46] just hold it just I want you to get
[1:05:50] this once again why would we fear
[1:05:55] something or someone that has no
[1:06:00] identity the only reason we fear is when
[1:06:04] we don't know our
[1:06:08] identity and when we don't have an
[1:06:12] identity we're making ourselves the same
[1:06:15] as
[1:06:18] that uh oh oh oh my my my my my watch
[1:06:22] this now watch this why was iniquity
[1:06:24] found in Satan or
[1:06:29] Lucifer why I want to know that why was
[1:06:33] you were perfect the Bible
[1:06:35] says Beauty and all these things but
[1:06:37] until iniquity was found in
[1:06:41] you you know why because he refused to
[1:06:46] accept his God given
[1:06:50] identity you were
[1:06:53] perfect what an
[1:06:55] identity you were perfect in Beauty a
[1:07:00] god-given
[1:07:01] identity church and every one of
[1:07:04] you each one of us that is here
[1:07:07] today one of us that is hearing today we
[1:07:11] were made
[1:07:12] perfect Beauty the problem is is that we
[1:07:16] want another
[1:07:19] identity we're looking for something
[1:07:22] else than what God has already
[1:07:26] given lufer wanted a different
[1:07:31] identity apart from
[1:07:33] God and he tries to do us the
[1:07:37] same and that is
[1:07:42] demonic what's the first thing that
[1:07:44] happens with
[1:07:46] people I'm not going to church no
[1:07:48] more what are they
[1:07:50] saying I don't have an identity and I'm
[1:07:54] trying to get an identity separate from
[1:07:59] God that's why people don't come to
[1:08:01] church right they they're trying to form
[1:08:04] another
[1:08:06] identity away from
[1:08:09] God watch
[1:08:12] it watch it you are now open to all
[1:08:16] these
[1:08:17] Devils that are looking for an
[1:08:20] identity oh church I I pray that you get
[1:08:23] this now
[1:08:25] those demons are trying to get into the
[1:08:27] promised
[1:08:32] land what is the promised
[1:08:36] land the Holy Spirit and where is the
[1:08:40] Holy

[1:08:50] the here is this Promised
[1:08:52] Land oh I like this watch watch as we
[1:08:56] get this going this is so
[1:08:58] good what is a false
[1:09:07] prophet brother Braham says it's a
[1:09:09] perverted
[1:09:11] preacher right it's a perverted
[1:09:15] preacher that some devil looking for an
[1:09:20] identity found someone to come into
[1:09:26] it's all it
[1:09:27] is you get somebody that's something
[1:09:29] that's
[1:09:30] false trying to copy something that's
[1:09:34] true ah watch watch here now and when he
[1:09:37] fully
[1:09:40] incarnates that's full
[1:09:43] possession and the word possession means
[1:09:48] ownership he
[1:09:50] occupies and when he does that perverts
[1:09:54] your
[1:09:56] identity how many Christians do we have
[1:09:59] here Christians means to be
[1:10:04] Christlike many Christians now you're
[1:10:06] just like
[1:10:08] Christ that's what Christian is you're
[1:10:12] like Christ how many of you live like
[1:10:15] Christ how many of you talk like
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:21] Christ okay here we go remember when I
[1:10:26] preached and I said to be like
[1:10:28] Jesus Who Wants to Be Like
[1:10:32] Jesus okay why are we complaining all
[1:10:35] the
[1:10:36] time he was a
[1:10:40] man a man of Sorrows the Bible
[1:10:44] say acquainted with
[1:10:48] grief wounded for our
[1:10:51] transgression bruis for our iniquity
[1:10:55] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:10:59] him you still want to be like
[1:11:03] Jesus I don't know why this is happening
[1:11:06] to me I guess Jesus don't love me you
[1:11:10] don't want to be like
[1:11:11] Jesus if you wanted to be like Jesus you
[1:11:14] would Praise Him and worship him you say
[1:11:18] Thank You Lord my character is being
[1:11:21] molded I am understanding my
[1:11:26] identity that's why we're here today is
[1:11:29] because we want to be sure about who who
[1:11:32] we are and what we
[1:11:34] are now now now notice this now in order
[1:11:38] for saying to be a
[1:11:42] man he has to

[1:12:08] you it does you no good unless it's
[1:12:11] inside of
[1:12:13] you and when the Holy Ghost or the Holy
[1:12:16] Spirit comes in

[1:12:22] high
[1:12:24] and you think it not
[1:12:27] robbery for you have put on the mind of
[1:12:31] Christ and the real
[1:12:34] robbery is when Satan tries to get into
[1:12:38] the
[1:12:41] congregation and he puts on a
[1:12:44] garment but he can't put on the holy
[1:12:50] ghost that was our founding pastor

[1:13:00] identity tell your neighbor neighbor War
[1:13:04] has been declared on your

[1:13:12] do is make us doubt who we really
[1:13:18] are oh come on now come on now you got
[1:13:21] to have to start pulling that now all
[1:13:24] Satan has to
[1:13:25] do is to make you doubt just one little
[1:13:29] thing I doubt it you're a Son of God I
[1:13:32] doubt it you don't know what I've done
[1:13:35] wait a minute wait a
[1:13:36] minute all he's got to do is make you
[1:13:39] doubt for one
[1:13:41] moment why so many in the world today
[1:13:44] don't know who they are or what they
[1:13:47] are they don't have they're looking for
[1:13:49] an
[1:13:51] identity and most people spend their
[1:13:53] entire lives trying to form an
[1:13:58] identity I'm sorry but I got all these
[1:14:00] points you just got to I'm G to say it
[1:14:03] again most people spend their whole life
[1:14:07] try to form an
[1:14:09] identity who who are you well um I want
[1:14:14] to be this great Sports
[1:14:17] person okay so they train and they do
[1:14:20] all these things what are they trying to
[1:14:22] do they're try form an
[1:14:24] identity because they want to be easily
[1:14:30] identified oh come on come on now I'm
[1:14:32] going to say that again this is what
[1:14:34] people want
[1:14:35] today I want everybody to identify me
[1:14:37] right
[1:14:39] away Michael Jordan boom oh yeah Michael
[1:14:41] Jordan best basketball player
[1:14:45] ever unless you're a Kobe fan or
[1:14:48] whatever that's not the point the point
[1:14:50] is easily identified
[1:14:54] we know who that is people long for that
[1:14:57] same thing I want to be known like this
[1:15:00] rock star this singer or this that or
[1:15:02] the
[1:15:04] other I don't want none of those

[1:15:13] identity I want to know who I am I want
[1:15:17] know where I came
[1:15:18] from I want to know what I'm doing here

[1:15:27] identity will I ever answer those
[1:15:31] questions watch this we don't form our
[1:15:34] own
[1:15:36] identity this is the problem in the
[1:15:39] churches I want to be known as a great
[1:15:47] preacher who cares about
[1:15:49] that I want to be known as some great
[1:15:52] somebody some great
[1:15:56] [Music]
[1:15:58] who cares about

[1:16:05] identity there's something longing
[1:16:07] there's something more there's greater
[1:16:09] inside of
[1:16:10] me something greater inside of
[1:16:14] you notice as as as this comes oh I just
[1:16:18] love
[1:16:20] this we don't form our own identity

[1:16:42] identity where are you

[1:16:53] already
[1:16:58] established either We believe We Came
[1:17:01] From God or we
[1:17:03] don't in the back part of God's
[1:17:07] mind our
[1:17:10] identity was already established in
[1:17:14] Christ when he thought of
[1:17:17] Christ he thought of
[1:17:20] us he didn't have one thought of Christ
[1:17:24] and another thought of you and
[1:17:26] I no when he thought of Christ he

[1:18:41] lies the bride's identity is found in
[1:18:47] Christ watch the tactics the tricks that
[1:18:49] the devil
[1:18:51] plays order to keep us from our
[1:18:55] identity why I love this message so
[1:19:00] much slap me across the
[1:19:04] face wake

[1:19:09] identity and when you see it you're like
[1:19:11] wow thanks for the good slap Lord I
[1:19:17] sure listen closely because this is so
[1:19:19] important in your
[1:19:21] lives if you ever write something down
[1:19:23] write this
[1:19:24] down this is the tricks that the devil
[1:19:27] plays with your
[1:19:30] identity this is our problem
[1:19:33] now we
[1:19:35] humans we Define
[1:19:38] ourselves okay everybody we're all we
[1:19:41] all Define
[1:19:42] ourselves we Define ourselves in our
[1:19:47] identity by what we do or fail to do for
[1:19:51] Christ
[1:19:54] I'm going to let that one sink in for a
[1:19:58] moment well I sure messed up I guess I I
[1:20:02] I don't even know why he loves me
[1:20:05] anymore trick of the
[1:20:09] devil we Define
[1:20:13] ourselves and our
[1:20:16] identity by what we
[1:20:18] do or fail to do for Christ
[1:20:24] but thanks be to
[1:20:27] God he judges us on a higher
[1:20:33] level he judges us with a different
[1:20:37] standard he defines Us by a higher
[1:20:42] standard listen listen closely now this
[1:20:44] is the key to
[1:20:47] overcoming Christ doesn't Define Us by
[1:20:50] what we do or don't do for him
[1:20:54] Christ defines Who We
[1:20:58] Are by who he is
[1:21:01] ljah uhuh nuh uhuh n uhuh you didn't get
[1:21:07] that you didn't get that because I see
[1:21:09] some of
[1:21:10] your and when you start looking like if
[1:21:12] you're in space somewhere you're not
[1:21:13] even here your body is here and the
[1:21:16] devil saying good job think of
[1:21:19] youres think about your work tomorrow
[1:21:23] pinch yourself wake up this
[1:21:25] morning Christ defines Who We
[1:21:29] Are by who he
[1:21:33] is that'll kill more Devils than
[1:21:36] anything
[1:21:37] else you look at what you did and you
[1:21:41] did this and you did that but look who
[1:21:44] he
[1:21:45] is because I came from him and I'm here
[1:21:49] manifested
[1:21:51] today because I have an
[1:21:55] identity he defines Us by what he has
[1:21:59] already
[1:22:01] done not by what I'm going to do he
[1:22:04] defines Us by what he already did for
[1:22:09] us do you see why it's so
[1:22:12] important that Paul would say it is no
[1:22:15] longer I that
[1:22:17] live but it's Christ that liveth in
[1:22:21] me our
[1:22:24] identity I don't want an identity
[1:22:27] without
[1:22:29] Christ it's Christ that lives in me and
[1:22:33] that's what gives me my
[1:22:36] identity I want you to repeat after me
[1:22:39] now my
[1:22:41] identity is
[1:22:44] defined by who Christ
[1:22:47] is and who I
[1:22:50] am in him in
[1:22:54] and no say it again tell your neighbor
[1:22:58] neighbor my
[1:23:00] identity is
[1:23:02] defined by who Christ
[1:23:05] is and who I
[1:23:08] am in
[1:23:11] him that's why these messages are so
[1:23:15] important he showing us who he
[1:23:19] is and then he says Who We Are
[1:23:25] the question is can you take him at his
[1:23:30] word watch the words watch

[1:27:42] with the Holy Ghost I was glorified
[1:27:45] before the foundation of the
[1:27:46] world he already saw the
[1:27:49] end he already made a way

[1:28:28] now and so our view of God is
[1:28:33] distorted and we serve God out of fear
[1:28:36] rather than
[1:28:40] love if our view of God is
[1:28:45] distorted then our view of Christ is
[1:28:51] distorted our view of Christ is
[1:28:55] distorted then our view of ourselves is
[1:29:01] distorted the same way that Satan tries
[1:29:03] to trick and attack
[1:29:07] us the same way that he attacked
[1:29:11] Jesus attacked his
[1:29:14] identity if thou be the Son of
[1:29:19] God Jesus never said let me prove to you
[1:29:22] that I'm the son
[1:29:24] of come on Church come on he'll attack
[1:29:29] your
[1:29:30] identity if thou be the Son of

[1:29:36] him
[1:29:37] like he didn't say well let me prove it
[1:29:40] to
[1:29:40] you the father had already spoken right
[1:29:46] before when he was
[1:29:48] baptized the father said this is my
[1:29:52] beloved
[1:29:53] Son who I am
[1:29:56] pleased with
[1:29:58] him the father had already given him his
[1:30:03] identity and yet he wants to come and
[1:30:05] challenge the
[1:30:07] identity church he already gave us our
[1:30:12] identity and it wasn't based upon
[1:30:14] whether we would make mistakes or
[1:30:18] not he knew we would repent if we didn't
[1:30:21] make mistake
[1:30:24] watch this now this is my beloved Son I
[1:30:28] don't know what time I
[1:30:30] started but who cares because because
[1:30:33] this is this is going to get some good
[1:30:34] stuff we're barely getting going
[1:30:38] right his
[1:30:40] identity was not up for
[1:30:45] discussion and I'm here to tell you
[1:30:48] today that our
[1:30:50] identity is not not up for
[1:30:56] discussion come on I want to say that
[1:30:58] again our identity is not up for
[1:31:03] discussion I don't have to prove nothing
[1:31:05] to the
[1:31:06] devil Christ already proved
[1:31:09] it ah watch this now how many of you
[1:31:13] want to know your
[1:31:15] identity okay 1 John 3 1 and
[1:31:20] 2 this is how we find our identity is in
[1:31:23] the
[1:31:25] scriptures somebody told me I was a Son
[1:31:27] of God no no no go back to the
[1:31:30] scriptures find it
[1:31:32] there and then go
[1:31:35] forward behold what manner of love the
[1:31:38] father has bestowed upon
[1:31:43] us that we should be called the sons of
[1:31:50] God sons of God do we have
[1:31:53] here all right therefore the world
[1:31:57] knoweth us
[1:31:59] not I want an identity that everybody
[1:32:03] knows therefore the world knoweth us
[1:32:08] not Mark Chavez Mark Chavez who's that
[1:32:12] the world don't know
[1:32:15] us because it knew him not
[1:32:20] either
[1:32:23] beloved now
[1:32:27] tomorrow
[1:32:29] yesterday
[1:32:31] beloved now are we the sons of
[1:32:35] God that's our
[1:32:37] identity and it does not yet appear what
[1:32:40] we shall
[1:32:43] be but we know that when he shall
[1:32:48] appear we shall be like him
[1:32:52] for we shall see him as he
[1:32:55] is that's why the greatest show of power
[1:32:59] on this
[1:33:01] Earth what's the greatest show of power
[1:33:03] in this
[1:33:07] earth praying and seeking and doing this
[1:33:11] and the dead
[1:33:15] rais the greatest show of
[1:33:20] power is when a son finds his
[1:33:24] position to them gave he power to become
[1:33:29] sons of
[1:33:31] God I just love
[1:33:34] that
[1:33:35] now it is our
[1:33:38] identity and Jesus knew that his
[1:33:41] identity was with the
[1:33:45] father and so what did he do he
[1:33:50] surrendered amen it's the hardest thing
[1:33:52] for us
[1:33:53] today surrender to him because when you
[1:33:57] do you got your
[1:34:00] identity oh no I'm going to do all this
[1:34:03] and I'm going to do all that and I'm
[1:34:04] going to do

[1:34:32] sure that we know who we
[1:34:35] are because when that bride recognizes
[1:34:38] who she is and what she

[1:34:45] is but what she is she will be an
[1:34:50] invincible Army

[1:35:57] cast out devils and we
[1:36:01] do these

[1:37:38] this is so
[1:37:40] tremendous she said and sister Tabitha
[1:37:43] if I say something that's out that's not
[1:37:44] right just let me know okay but to the
[1:37:48] best of my my
[1:37:50] understanding he said she was in bed and
[1:37:52] she in in this
[1:37:55] dream I believe she she heard some
[1:37:57] preaching going
[1:37:59] on and she's thinking maybe Mark
[1:38:01] couldn't brother Mark her husband
[1:38:03] couldn't
[1:38:06] sleep maybe he's got a message
[1:38:09] going he went over to look and brother
[1:38:12] Mark was
[1:38:14] asleep she said but but right next to
[1:38:17] the
[1:38:18] bed she saw Pastor Caleb
[1:38:22] standing on the side of the bed over
[1:38:25] him he was
[1:38:29] preaching she said it looked just like
[1:38:37] you wh watch my sheep hear my
[1:38:41] voice it looked just like you she
[1:38:44] says but the preaching style was
[1:38:49] different all points
[1:38:52] matter it wasn't exactly like
[1:38:55] yours something was different about
[1:38:58] you but I couldn't put my finger on it
[1:39:01] she
[1:39:02] says she said then you started to
[1:39:07] say identity isn't
[1:39:17] important people are being
[1:39:20] misled
[1:39:21] because they're putting too much focus
[1:39:23] on
[1:39:26] identity said then you turn to look at
[1:39:30] me and you said for
[1:39:33] example the next time you do a Christmas
[1:39:37] play you don't have to put so much
[1:39:40] emphasis on who Mary
[1:39:43] was there's too much emphasis on the
[1:39:48] identity that it takes away from the
[1:39:50] word
[1:39:53] word she said okay I'm
[1:39:58] sorry but at this
[1:40:00] time she said I realized what was
[1:40:04] different you
[1:40:07] always have so much love she
[1:40:11] says even when you're correcting us
[1:40:13] there's love
[1:40:15] there but this person lacked love when
[1:40:18] he
[1:40:19] spoke
[1:40:21] it came to my mind the time that Jesus
[1:40:23] sent his disciples
[1:40:26] out says how will the people know who we
[1:40:31] are what the identity here he answered
[1:40:35] them by the love you have one for
[1:40:39] another then about that I thought about
[1:40:43] Mary a virgin who
[1:40:46] conceived that was part of her
[1:40:49] identity her identity is what helped
[1:40:53] fulfill
[1:40:56] scripture he continued just focusing on
[1:40:59] the word identity is not
[1:41:07] important watch a Believer now even when
[1:41:11] you're asleep whether you're in a
[1:41:14] vision the the The Valor the courage
[1:41:17] that comes
[1:41:19] forth she look looked up and said you're
[1:41:26] wrong it's all
[1:41:30] important people's identity is part of
[1:41:33] the
[1:41:34] word say I began to rebuke
[1:41:38] him and told him he needed to
[1:41:40] leave and as he began to walk out of my
[1:41:43] bedroom into the
[1:41:45] hallway he said I thought of my boys who
[1:41:48] were in the bedrooms right outside of
[1:41:49] ours
[1:41:52] and I said and don't you even
[1:41:55] think about bothering those
[1:41:58] boys because you know whose blood covers
[1:42:03] them and it don't it doesn't only cover
[1:42:07] them it flows inside of
[1:42:11] them so you know
[1:42:13] better said he turned back around and it
[1:42:17] was no longer in the form of brother
[1:42:19] Caleb
[1:42:21] he had been
[1:42:23] unmasked by this time he looked like a
[1:42:25] pale blond haired in
[1:42:29] Angel and he said this is your final
[1:42:34] warning right away right oh my gosh he's
[1:42:37] giving me a an
[1:42:39] ultimatum shush you don't give me final
[1:42:46] warnings God does with me as he sees
[1:42:49] please
[1:42:52] I told him you tried to come with at me
[1:42:55] as my
[1:42:58] pastor and now you're trying to come as
[1:43:00] a different
[1:43:02] Angel she said then suddenly I I stood
[1:43:05] up lifted my hands and began to
[1:43:09] sing
[1:43:11] Holy he is
[1:43:13] holy king of kings Lord of lords he is
[1:43:18] Holy she said and then I encourage
[1:43:20] enaged
[1:43:21] him to sing along with me
[1:43:25] Hallelujah I like
[1:43:27] [Applause]
[1:43:29] that and he told me I was making a big
[1:43:34] mistake but every try time he tried to
[1:43:37] talk I would say he is
[1:43:41] holy king of kings Lord of lords he is
[1:43:45] Holy he said this is your last
[1:43:48] opportunity you're going to regret it if
[1:43:50] you don't listen to
[1:43:52] me she said I walked right up to
[1:43:56] him and I I began to sing contined
[1:43:59] singing you're not
[1:44:02] holy you're not holy you're not the King
[1:44:06] of Kings not the Lord of lords not holy
[1:44:11] he says and at that time said I rebuke
[1:44:15] you and at that same moment the facade
[1:44:19] that the angel had began to fade
[1:44:23] away he said fine you want to see my
[1:44:27] form and he began to grow
[1:44:30] tall I could hear his his head graze
[1:44:33] against the
[1:44:35] ceiling his skin was like a
[1:44:40] rocer but I refused to look at
[1:44:43] him I thought it was
[1:44:46] strange that he didn't say do you want
[1:44:48] to know who I really am
[1:44:52] or do you want to know my
[1:44:55] identity he didn't say that he just said
[1:44:58] do you want to see my
[1:45:00] form looking
[1:45:02] aside I see he's such a
[1:45:06] farce I said I know who you are you're
[1:45:10] an
[1:45:11] enemy that has already been
[1:45:15] defeated oh my Lord come on church if we
[1:45:19] could learn
[1:45:21] to talk and to stand up for what's
[1:45:25] right what chance would all of Hell have
[1:45:28] against
[1:45:29] us you're already
[1:45:31] defeated at that point I woke
[1:45:34] up I wondered why I had sang those
[1:45:38] songs and I figured probably
[1:45:43] because it talks about the identity of
[1:45:48] Christ Lord of lords
[1:45:51] you are worthy You Are Holy it makes so
[1:45:55] much sense now
[1:45:56] Church there was a scripture that I
[1:46:00] always thought of and and I I I didn't
[1:46:03] really have a grasp of what this
[1:46:05] scripture was
[1:46:07] saying but I get it now when Paul in the
[1:46:11] book of
[1:46:12] Galatians chap 1 verse 8
[1:46:15] says but though
[1:46:18] we are an angel from heaven
[1:46:21] Heaven preach any other gospel unto
[1:46:25] you than what we have preached unto
[1:46:30] you let him be a
[1:46:34] curse I said it makes sense now did Paul
[1:46:39] think that one day he was gonna gonna
[1:46:41] preach something
[1:46:44] different come on Church Paul wasn't
[1:46:46] thinking that did he think that one day
[1:46:49] maybe maybe he would lose his mind and
[1:46:51] and preach something
[1:46:54] different because he said if we are an
[1:46:57] angel from
[1:46:59] heaven oh no he didn't think that but he
[1:47:04] knew that those Fallen
[1:47:06] Angels try to even use his
[1:47:12] identity I'm going to say it again he
[1:47:15] knew that those Fallen Angels would to
[1:47:19] take his identity
[1:47:22] to deceive the people but my sheep hear
[1:47:26] my
[1:47:26] voice and a stranger voice they will not
[1:47:31] follow that's why you need a
[1:47:34] pastor to hear that voice it's not the
[1:47:37] man it's the voice behind the
[1:47:40] voice speaking to you giving you your
[1:47:46] identity let him be a cursed
[1:47:50] right you say is that possible
[1:47:54] brother Jesus said in Matthew
[1:47:58] 24 many shall come in my name saying I
[1:48:01] am the
[1:48:03] Christ let him be a
[1:48:07] cursed is it
[1:48:09] possible that he could take on a
[1:48:12] form sure isn't that what happened to
[1:48:16] Luther when San came to him as
[1:48:21] Jesus saying worship
[1:48:23] me he looked at him something was
[1:48:27] off
[1:48:29] oh oh you have a crown on your
[1:48:33] head and Jesus has not been crowned
[1:48:36] yet for the Saints shall
[1:48:40] Crown she he had found his identity in
[1:48:42] the
[1:48:43] word when you find your identity in the
[1:48:46] word there no devil that can deceive you
[1:48:50] they're trying to deceive you they're
[1:48:52] trying to give you another identity
[1:48:54] they're trying to say oh look what you
[1:48:56] did you're a drunk you're a drug
[1:49:01] addict you're he's trying to give you an
[1:49:04] identity another
[1:49:05] identity I'm telling you this morning
[1:49:07] give it back to
[1:49:09] him I'm going to say it again give it
[1:49:11] back to him that's not our
[1:49:15] identity now we are the sons of
[1:49:19] God
[1:49:20] right now we are the sons of
[1:49:23] God and for this purpose the Son of God
[1:49:27] was
[1:49:28] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:49:31] works of the
[1:49:33] devil whoever is born of God can even
[1:49:36] commit
[1:49:38] sin for his seed remaineth in
[1:49:42] him he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:49:46] God it's all about identity
[1:49:53] it's so
[1:49:54] important that brother Bram preaches so
[1:49:57] many
[1:49:59] messages identified with
[1:50:02] Christ go listen to these
[1:50:05] messages five identifications of the
[1:50:08] True Church of the Living
[1:50:14] God identification
[1:50:17] identific God is identified by his
[1:50:19] character
[1:50:21] istics God is God identifying himself by
[1:50:25] his
[1:50:28] characteristics the identified Christ of
[1:50:30] all
[1:50:32] ages the identification of Christ in all
[1:50:37] ages Christ is identified the same in
[1:50:40] all
[1:50:42] generations the identified Masterpiece
[1:50:45] of
[1:50:48] God don't ever let the devil tell you
[1:50:51] that identity is not
[1:50:54] important everything who we are and what
[1:50:57] hangs on
[1:50:59] it now notice this now can I have just a
[1:51:02] little bit more
[1:51:03] time there there there's there's another
[1:51:05] part that I want to get to so
[1:51:08] good wait a minute wait a minute I'm GNA
[1:51:11] do an uncle on
[1:51:16] here woo those grapes are pretty good
[1:51:20] I just crossed over and got some big old
[1:51:24] grapes but I'm going to need some
[1:51:26] help big old grapes
[1:51:29] across help me out here this morning
[1:51:32] take some of these
[1:51:33] grapes the scripture tells us that the
[1:51:37] two Spirits would be so close in the
[1:51:39] last
[1:51:41] days that it would deceive the very
[1:51:43] elect if it were possible but it's
[1:51:47] not then the only way to tell the
[1:51:49] difference
[1:51:52] is to identify them by the
[1:51:57] characteristics the prophet balam was
[1:52:01] fundamental but the prophet Moses was
[1:52:06] identified I'm going to say it again the
[1:52:08] prophet
[1:52:09] balam was
[1:52:11] fundamental fundamentally Moab and
[1:52:13] Israel the
[1:52:15] same but the prophet
[1:52:18] Moses was Iden
[1:52:21] by the characteristics of
[1:52:25] God fundamentally all churches seem to
[1:52:28] be oh relatively the
[1:52:31] same but the Church of the Living
[1:52:34] God is known by the characteristics of
[1:52:38] God because she has an
[1:52:41] identity the other ones have a form of
[1:52:45] godliness but they deny the power
[1:52:48] thereof how are these he was identified
[1:52:50] by the characteristics of
[1:52:53] God there was the pillar of fire they
[1:52:56] had in their
[1:52:57] camp superal
[1:53:00] light hanging over
[1:53:03] them there was great healings in their
[1:53:07] Camp Supernatural God staying with the
[1:53:11] word that was given to
[1:53:14] Abraham the
[1:53:16] promise that he would have a son
[1:53:20] but now Moses and Abraham's
[1:53:22] promise they were going to the promised
[1:53:26] land B also a prophet of the
[1:53:30] Lord standing down there but the only
[1:53:33] way you could
[1:53:35] identify was by those
[1:53:38] characteristics but watch now the shout
[1:53:41] of the King was in their
[1:53:47] Camp okay okay
[1:53:52] everybody comes to
[1:53:54] church they clap their
[1:53:56] hands raise their hands say Amen all the
[1:54:00] churches are full
[1:54:02] today and all these things going
[1:54:05] on fundamentally the
[1:54:09] same even in the same local
[1:54:14] congregation about the
[1:54:17] same every now and then this one's a
[1:54:19] little Louder Than This One
[1:54:21] fundamentally the
[1:54:24] same
[1:54:27] fundamentally but in one
[1:54:29] Camp there's a shout of the
[1:54:33] King come on now come on come on this is
[1:54:37] your
[1:54:38] Camp the angel of the Lord
[1:54:40] encamps this is your camp in some camps
[1:54:44] there shout of the king
[1:54:46] inside I don't come waiting to hear the
[1:54:49] shout of the
[1:54:50] King he's already shouted in
[1:54:53] here watch what he says here the
[1:54:56] atonement was in
[1:54:59] effect the brass
[1:55:01] serpent the SP
[1:55:05] Rock God identifying
[1:55:08] himself by his
[1:55:10] characteristics and he identified
[1:55:12] himself with
[1:55:14] Moses God's characteristics are not
[1:55:18] natural we can all
[1:55:20] pray some pray in the spirit and some
[1:55:23] pray in the in the
[1:55:27] flesh God's characteristic is
[1:55:32] Supernatural because he's the
[1:55:34] Creator and when he begins to display
[1:55:38] itself it's so unusual to the modern
[1:55:42] thinking that throws them
[1:55:45] offline they cannot understand it yet he
[1:55:49] never gets away from his
[1:55:51] promise he's allotted it to every
[1:55:56] age watch how brother brandham then
[1:55:58] explains John
[1:56:01] 1412 verily verily I say unto you he
[1:56:05] that believeth on
[1:56:07] me the works that I do shall he do
[1:56:11] also and Greater Works than the shall he
[1:56:15] do because I go unto my father watch his
[1:56:19] explanation of this in other words he
[1:56:23] that believeth on me shall be identified
[1:56:27] by my characteristics The
[1:56:31] Works watch how brother brandham
[1:56:33] explains Hebrew
[1:56:36] one God who had Sun
[1:56:39] Times and different manners spake in
[1:56:43] times passed unto the fathers by the
[1:56:46] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[1:56:49] to us by his
[1:56:52] son now watch
[1:56:54] him say this is the way the scripture
[1:56:56] should
[1:56:58] read God in sunnd
[1:57:01] Times by the
[1:57:03] prophets he identified
[1:57:06] himself and in this last days he has
[1:57:10] identified
[1:57:11] himself through the
[1:57:15] son what think you of
[1:57:18] Christ
[1:57:20] he's making Hebrews
[1:57:22] 138 the
[1:57:25] same he the same that's that word he's
[1:57:28] the same yesterday today forever he
[1:57:34] same yes amen or is he different come on
[1:57:38] church is he
[1:57:41] different brother Bram says he's the
[1:57:43] same in every
[1:57:46] detail except this morning he's wearing
[1:57:50] a blue
[1:57:55] suit he's wearing a black suit
[1:57:58] today but it's the same he is the same
[1:58:02] church he does not change only his mask
[1:58:06] or only where he has incarnated
[1:58:10] into church I wish I could I wish I had
[1:58:13] so much time to get into
[1:58:15] this but I have to skip some of this
[1:58:18] because I'm coming to this part
[1:58:21] you wear clothes that are
[1:58:24] immoral why you say well you can't say
[1:58:27] that that person is
[1:58:29] immoral I can judge no one he
[1:58:32] says but by their fruits they're
[1:58:37] known they may not actually commit the
[1:58:41] crime but on them is a spirit that's
[1:58:44] driving them to immoral IM
[1:58:48] immorality we are identified by the
[1:58:50] spirit that anoints
[1:58:55] us blah blah blah blah you know did you
[1:59:00] know you already know that phrase did
[1:59:02] you know stop it I don't want to hear
[1:59:09] it you
[1:59:11] know the devil's
[1:59:14] coming did you
[1:59:17] know never mind mind I'm not even going
[1:59:20] to get into my the rest of my
[1:59:23] message the deception Len closely I'm
[1:59:27] GNA come this and then I'm gonna I'm
[1:59:28] gonna I'm gonna hit this and then I'm
[1:59:29] going to go to that this last part okay
[1:59:32] we're winding down
[1:59:35] now we as
[1:59:38] Believers we can identify the written
[1:59:40] word
[1:59:42] right see
[1:59:45] wow glor hallelu sh
[1:59:51] oo wow we can identify this sure we can
[1:59:57] even identify the prophet that he
[2:00:01] sent brought the word and revealing
[2:00:05] Christ but why is it that we have such a
[2:00:09] hard
[2:00:12] time
[2:00:14] identifying what the message has
[2:00:17] produced wow
[2:00:21] we don't have a hard time recognizing
[2:00:23] what the message
[2:00:25] says brother says this says that we
[2:00:29] don't have a hard time at recognizing
[2:00:31] that but when that message
[2:00:35] produces we have a hard time with
[2:00:40] that we want more
[2:00:43] Revelation but we're afraid of
[2:00:48] manifestation
[2:00:49] oh Church come on I'm going to say it
[2:00:51] again we we want more
[2:00:54] Revelation but we're afraid of
[2:00:58] manifestation did you see what brother
[2:01:00] brandham
[2:01:01] says he said this and this yes I do I
[2:01:05] see it I have seen the identification of
[2:01:08] it that word is identified in his
[2:01:13] people what are we looking
[2:01:15] for this is the time Church no other age
[2:01:20] no other time has the sons of God ever
[2:01:24] been
[2:01:26] manifested of this time right
[2:01:28] now this is the full complete
[2:01:31] manifestation of the
[2:01:33] word why do we struggle with
[2:01:41] that know who you
[2:01:44] are nothing against the these this
[2:01:46] brother so I'm not saying it I'm like
[2:01:49] cuz you don't know who it
[2:01:51] is but they were laughing about some
[2:01:55] movie and man can you believe it they
[2:01:59] did this in this movie and
[2:02:01] this and it was rather
[2:02:05] vulgar and I had to say
[2:02:07] something and I
[2:02:10] said what I can't
[2:02:14] believe is that a Christian would be
[2:02:16] watching those things
[2:02:20] that's what I don't
[2:02:22] understand the filth that we watch and
[2:02:25] we we we channel
[2:02:27] in that's what I don't get how can a
[2:02:31] minister of the Gospel be watching those
[2:02:35] things how can people in the
[2:02:37] congregation be watching those
[2:02:41] things come on now somebody's deceived
[2:02:44] you about your
[2:02:46] identity I say that to help
[2:02:50] why there's so many things that we we we
[2:02:52] don't
[2:02:54] discern how many of you like listening
[2:02:56] to
[2:03:05] music no you're not
[2:03:08] truthful I'm gonna ask you again how
[2:03:11] many of you like listening to
[2:03:14] music
[2:03:15] okay why do you listen to music I I I
[2:03:19] had a conversation and and I won't go
[2:03:20] into the full conversation but a
[2:03:21] wonderful conversation with a
[2:03:25] brother why do you listen to music and
[2:03:28] what kind of music do you listen
[2:03:30] to uh I like this genre and got their
[2:03:33] their time their kind or
[2:03:38] style why do you listen ah you know get
[2:03:41] home from work and just want to
[2:03:43] relax down whatever you do whatever you
[2:03:46] do what you do I don't know only you
[2:03:49] know what you do you do what you
[2:03:54] do but I ask the question
[2:03:57] this who lives in your heart who
[2:04:01] supposed to live in your
[2:04:03] heart come on come on you that like to
[2:04:06] crank it in your
[2:04:08] vehicles forgive me I shouldn't have
[2:04:10] done that but you know what I mean some
[2:04:13] like to crank it up
[2:04:16] right oh come on you no
[2:04:19] if you want help the first thing you got
[2:04:20] to do is you got to be
[2:04:23] honest I mean like to crank it in their
[2:04:30] car
[2:04:35] brother peace out love you man yeah cuz
[2:04:40] we have those things in common but my
[2:04:42] question was this to the
[2:04:45] brother if your heart is the Throne of
[2:04:48] God
[2:04:51] and we are we're to be patterned after
[2:04:54] what Moses saw in
[2:04:58] heaven is that the kind of music that
[2:05:00] they have up
[2:05:02] there come on
[2:05:04] now do you listen to music for your
[2:05:09] enjoyment or do you listen to the music
[2:05:12] to create an atmosphere for the one that
[2:05:13] lives
[2:05:16] inside that'll make you think twice
[2:05:19] before you turn it on
[2:05:21] again but I tell you this because Christ
[2:05:24] must be
[2:05:26] identified in our homes in our job in
[2:05:31] our alone time in every aspect of our
[2:05:34] life we must we must know that his
[2:05:37] identity lives on in
[2:05:40] us the thief doesn't come but to
[2:05:45] kill to steal what is he stealing your
[2:05:50] identity they're going to destroy
[2:05:53] you take your
[2:05:55] identity he wants to kill and to destroy
[2:05:59] you but a man brother Bram says this but
[2:06:02] a man has got to be convinced
[2:06:06] first and the only convincing thing
[2:06:11] is
[2:06:14] manifestation
[2:06:17] wowow this
[2:06:19] Listen to listen with everything you got
[2:06:21] for the next 5 10
[2:06:23] minutes this is where the message is
[2:06:25] hinged on
[2:06:28] now the only convincing
[2:06:32] thing is the
[2:06:35] manifestation now if in no other time
[2:06:39] for the sons of God to ever be made
[2:06:42] Manifest this is the only
[2:06:45] time that the children of God have their
[2:06:49] complete
[2:06:53] identity what a what a mouthful that one
[2:06:56] is in no other time did they have their
[2:07:00] complete
[2:07:02] identity except in the manifestation of
[2:07:05] the sons of
[2:07:07] God here the only convincing thing is
[2:07:09] the
[2:07:11] manifestation it says or the identity of
[2:07:15] the
[2:07:16] Gospel being identif ifed in
[2:07:22] you Jesus said these signs shall
[2:07:25] identify those who
[2:07:29] believe now we said everything we said

[2:08:25] of
[2:08:27] Christ so watch now if this let's just
[2:08:30] say this is the mind of

[2:08:54] think this is important now what did
[2:08:57] this mind of Christ
[2:09:02] thinky let's go to the next
[2:09:04] verse continue reading what did this
[2:09:07] mind think that was in Christ
[2:09:11] Jesus who being in the form of
[2:09:15] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[2:09:19] with
[2:09:21] God he said it's not
[2:09:24] robbery that I be equal with
[2:09:26] God so let that mind be in you so that
[2:09:32] you don't think it's
[2:09:34] robbery to be equal
[2:09:36] also oh no church if you don't get who
[2:09:39] you

[2:10:06] robbery equal with God don't think it's
[2:10:11] robbery equal church now now now I got
[2:10:14] to stop here because this blew me away
[2:10:17] and this this is the just of my message
[2:10:20] I don't know what just follow me right
[2:10:22] here and I get excited and sometimes you
[2:10:25] can't even understand what I'm saying go
[2:10:27] back and listen to it again him being in
[2:10:30] the form of God but it not robbery to be
[2:10:33] equal with
[2:10:35] God I began to hear the prophet
[2:10:39] speak God is identified the same in all
[2:10:43] generations so I'm taking the mind of
[2:10:47] Christ bring it to my
[2:10:50] generation come on come on church this
[2:10:52] is not something in the past this is not
[2:10:56] robbery be equal with God and he's
[2:11:00] identified in every
[2:11:02] generation even my
[2:11:05] generation your
[2:11:07] generation identifying himself right
[2:11:11] now watch what brother brandham says now
[2:11:14] he was the manifestation of God God was
[2:11:17] in Christ
[2:11:19] reconciling the world to
[2:11:20] himself he was expressing what the
[2:11:23] father
[2:11:24] was in
[2:11:26] himself he said I do always that which
[2:11:29] pleases the
[2:11:32] father and the I and the father are one
[2:11:36] the father dwells in me when you see me
[2:11:40] you've seen the father in other words he
[2:11:43] expressed
[2:11:45] God the spirit so much in in
[2:11:50] him he and the
[2:11:52] father it wasn't
[2:11:55] robbery for him to be the same
[2:12:00] person I'm going to say it again
[2:12:03] Hallelujah he said it's not
[2:12:06] robbery but show us the father if you've
[2:12:09] seen me you seen the father not robbery
[2:12:13] CU I and the father are
[2:12:15] one we are the same person
[2:12:19] all right now now now let this mind
[2:12:23] Jesus saying me and the
[2:12:25] father we're the same person that's why
[2:12:28] there's not three
[2:12:31] persons no such a thing that came from
[2:12:34] the pits of
[2:12:37] Hell father are one you've seen me youve
[2:12:41] seen the Father the same
[2:12:45] person come on now come on now now we
[2:12:48] put that point now we're coming to
[2:12:49] another one he was the Tabernacle of God
[2:12:53] he was the express image of God he was
[2:12:57] what God through his power
[2:13:01] projected a part a body which was called
[2:13:05] son because he was a man and he come
[2:13:08] from God and he was so committed to
[2:13:13] God till he didn't think it
[2:13:16] robbery him and God being the same
[2:13:21] person and they were because in the
[2:13:25] beginning was the word the word was with
[2:13:28] God and the Word was God they were the
[2:13:32] same Jesus didn't think it
[2:13:34] robbery he was the
[2:13:36] person now if we leave it there we miss
[2:13:40] the
[2:13:42] message why do you
[2:13:44] think it
[2:13:46] robbery to be equal with or the same
[2:13:50] person let this mind be in
[2:13:54] you let it be in
[2:13:58] you you're
[2:14:02] [Music]
[2:14:04] nothing you need to find out what your
[2:14:07] who your identity you got find that out
[2:14:11] when you do no devil in hell going to
[2:14:13] tell you anything
[2:14:16] different come on now I'm coming I'm
[2:14:19] coming around the corner a big long one
[2:14:21] but I'm I'm coming full steam
[2:14:25] ahead what
[2:14:27] mind do we think it's robbery to be the
[2:14:31] same he's the same in every
[2:14:34] detail except the little Corporal
[2:14:37] body then we are his body
[2:14:40] today Jesus said at that day day right
[2:14:45] now at that day you'll know that I am in
[2:14:48] the Father the father and me I and you
[2:14:51] you and me there's God working
[2:14:55] through so when a person is so
[2:14:57] completely yielded to the Holy
[2:15:01] Spirit speaking it is not the person
[2:15:06] speaking
[2:15:08] anymore the Holy Ghost comes down and
[2:15:12] brother
[2:15:13] Noah he begins to speak it's not the
[2:15:16] person Noah anymore
[2:15:18] you know Noah but you just can't see
[2:15:21] Beyond the Veil but when the Holy Spirit
[2:15:23] comes down it's the Holy Spirit speaking
[2:15:28] now do you think it's
[2:15:31] robbery to be the same
[2:15:36] person oh church I'm trying to let you
[2:15:38] go but I
[2:15:40] can't I can't there's something pulling
[2:15:42] that there's pulling more come on now I
[2:15:44] I I got to get this across to
[2:15:46] you
[2:15:48] if he puts his word in a
[2:15:52] person then it's not the person
[2:15:56] anymore it's
[2:16:00] him you think it's robbery to be the
[2:16:03] same
[2:16:04] person if he puts his words in a
[2:16:08] person it's not the person
[2:16:11] anymore it's him
[2:16:15] it's there's no devil that should ever
[2:16:17] put you finger in your mouth
[2:16:20] anymore watch what he
[2:16:23] says he likened in many parables a
[2:16:27] husband and
[2:16:30] wife he called The Church
[2:16:33] bride and the bride is no
[2:16:37] longer and the
[2:16:39] bridegroom is no longer two
[2:16:44] people they are
[2:16:46] one we've heard that so many times but
[2:16:50] once again he'll think it not
[2:16:53] robbery to be the same
[2:16:58] person this is borderline right
[2:17:01] now right here Christ and Antichrist
[2:17:06] this is how close it
[2:17:08] is you go one way a little bit
[2:17:13] Antichrist you come this way a little
[2:17:15] bit you're exactly right not she is
[2:17:19] flesh of his flesh bone of his
[2:17:21] bone man and woman it's called the
[2:17:24] mystical Body of
[2:17:26] Christ now the True Church of
[2:17:30] Jesus the bride is liken to pure
[2:17:35] gold her righteousness is his
[2:17:38] righteousness her attributes are his own
[2:17:41] glorious
[2:17:43] attributes her identity is found in him
[2:17:48] what he is she is to
[2:17:51] reflect what he
[2:17:53] has she is to
[2:17:56] manifest there's no fault in her she's
[2:17:59] glorious within and
[2:18:01] without am I talking to anybody here all
[2:18:04] right from beginning to end she is the
[2:18:06] work of her
[2:18:08] Lord all works are
[2:18:11] perfect in her is summed
[2:18:16] up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[2:18:20] purpose of
[2:18:22] God how can you fathom
[2:18:24] that accept it by
[2:18:27] faith now I'm gonna I'm I'm gonna finish
[2:18:29] with this
[2:18:30] now promise
[2:18:32] you I'm sorry I'm not
[2:18:36] sorry so I take that
[2:18:40] [Applause]
[2:18:45] back can any man
[2:18:48] this is a question can any man do the
[2:18:51] works of Christ unless he was
[2:18:57] Christ it's a question they asked
[2:18:59] brother
[2:19:02] brandham the man
[2:19:06] himself can't be
[2:19:09] Christ but the works of Christ will
[2:19:12] follow every
[2:19:15] believer he'll do the works of Christ in
[2:19:17] any
[2:19:19] man but he believes in me and has
[2:19:21] confessed by
[2:19:23] faith and died out to
[2:19:26] himself my spirit will dwell in him and
[2:19:29] he becomes a part of
[2:19:32] me then brother BR says now that don't
[2:19:36] make him
[2:19:38] Christ not one person by
[2:19:45] themselves it makes him
[2:19:48] part of
[2:19:50] Christ with the rest of the
[2:19:53] church all right he is not Christ
[2:19:58] because that would be
[2:20:01] Antichrist you see he would be taking
[2:20:03] away from
[2:20:05] Christ but he can do the works of
[2:20:08] Christ any believer okay now watch this
[2:20:12] question now then it comes down to a
[2:20:13] brother
[2:20:14] Bram brother brandham sister came
[2:20:19] Tabernacle she believes you are Jesus
[2:20:21] Christ
[2:20:24] incarnate brother Bram simply
[2:20:26] says the sister was
[2:20:29] wrong I am not Jesus
[2:20:31] Christ I am his
[2:20:37] servant I am not Jesus Christ I am his
[2:20:41] servant watch this you think it not
[2:20:45] robbery to be the same
[2:20:47] person oh not that person that lived
[2:20:51] 2,000 years
[2:20:52] ago watch as brother brandham answers
[2:20:56] this brother Bram they're saying that
[2:20:59] you're more than a
[2:21:00] man you can
[2:21:03] create Jesus can look just like brother
[2:21:08] brandham whoever it is I don't know said
[2:21:12] but I am your
[2:21:14] brother see Jesus is your
[2:21:18] savior I cannot be your
[2:21:21] savior he has already saved
[2:21:24] you see you're so close to being the
[2:21:29] truth
[2:21:31] there yet you're so far from the
[2:21:35] truth in One S sense of the word it's
[2:21:38] exactly the
[2:21:41] truth in other sense it is the
[2:21:45] Antichrist that's the difference between
[2:21:47] right and
[2:21:49] wrong to make me the person of the Lord
[2:21:53] Jesus be an
[2:21:56] antichrist for that person of the Lord
[2:21:59] Jesus is sitting at the right hand of
[2:22:02] the Majesty on
[2:22:04] high and will come again in great power
[2:22:07] and
[2:22:09] Glory but for his life that was in him
[2:22:16] being upon me
[2:22:18] and upon you who have him it's exactly
[2:22:23] the
[2:22:25] truth you become
[2:22:28] Christ if all that God
[2:22:31] was he pour it into Christ and Christ
[2:22:35] thought it not
[2:22:37] robbery the person of God and all that
[2:22:41] Christ was he poured into the church and
[2:22:45] she don't think it's robbery
[2:22:48] to be the same person or to be
[2:22:51] Christ because him and her are one and
[2:22:54] the same you become Christ so let this
[2:22:58] mind be in you where you think not
[2:23:02] robbery oh brother and sister you're
[2:23:05] going to say that I'm Jesus Christ oh
[2:23:07] that's
[2:23:09] error but to be Anointed with his
[2:23:12] Spirit brings his own
[2:23:15] person brings own
[2:23:18] person are you getting it if you say to
[2:23:21] be Anointed with his
[2:23:23] Spirit which brings his own purpose of
[2:23:27] his
[2:23:30] life into
[2:23:32] you oh it's still
[2:23:36] him but now he's using your
[2:23:41] Tabernacle don't think it

[2:56:07] [Applause]
[2:56:11] service the service of
[2:56:14] of saying
[2:56:20] goodbye wanted to let you know that this
[2:56:22] week I'm going back to my
[2:56:25] country a wonderful
[2:56:30] news that I'm totally healed of what I
[2:56:33] was suffering
[2:56:34] [Applause]
[2:56:42] with that's why Bo God allowed me to
[2:56:45] come to this
[2:56:51] land to prove that the god of healing is
[2:56:54] still as in the day that he started
[2:56:55] working upon the
[2:56:57] earth when I heard about the testimony
[2:57:03] today but the prayer that brother Caleb
[2:57:05] did for the brother that was
[2:57:10] affected prove that Jesus Christ is the
[2:57:12] same yesterday today
[2:57:16] do not let your guard down lift up your
[2:57:19] faith without faith it is impossible to
[2:57:21] please
[2:57:22] God faith is
[2:57:26] revelation is not an emotion or
[2:57:30] thought it is the action of the word in
[2:57:34] you for you to say the name of the
[2:57:38] Lord and whatever you say that will come
[2:57:40] to
[2:57:43] pass
[2:57:44] people don't get to believe that that is
[2:57:49] true Everything you ask
[2:57:52] believing that you shall receive
[2:57:55] it that will be
[2:57:58] so but faith
[2:58:01] has a
[2:58:07] calendar the Lord knows in what month
[2:58:09] and what day he's going to give you the
[2:58:10] answer to your
[2:58:12] petition
[2:58:15] immediate
[2:58:16] things are a
[2:58:18] miracle the things that you hope that
[2:58:21] you wait that is for
[2:58:29] Faith I want to thank God
[2:58:32] first for permitting me to be
[2:58:38] here to say goodbye to my friend brother
[2:58:42] Tommy
[2:58:45] and being here at the last moment of
[2:58:48] his that's a privilege that the lord
[2:58:50] gave me to be here with my
[2:58:53] friend until
[2:59:02] death there's many
[2:59:09] friends there's no like one
[2:59:12] friend there is just one
[2:59:17] friend but Jesus only had one
[2:59:21] friend because it's
[2:59:26] individual with each one of us it's

[3:05:44] that brother Caleb is his
[3:05:46] pastor and that I am his
[3:06:00] dad as as a married man you know that

[3:06:27] calleded that your children scold you
[3:06:32] now does it
[3:06:35] feel don't eat this take care of
[3:06:39] this the law of of prohibiting
[3:06:47] things when you get to be old you're
[3:06:49] going to remember of
[3:06:55] this also I want to thank my son Fabi
[3:06:58] Moes that is in
[3:07:01] colia he was very attentive of my uh
[3:07:04] state of
[3:07:08] health made the effort to come here
[3:07:12] and
[3:07:17] he took the good news to the people in
[3:07:18] Colombia which I am responsible
[3:07:22] of my wife as
[3:07:26] well wants to thank all of
[3:07:30] you for your kind
[3:07:34] invitations and that human warmth that
[3:07:37] you have in
[3:07:39] here to make us feel at home
[3:07:43] thank you very
[3:07:44] much we want to thank each one of you
[3:07:47] for
[3:07:50] that and to
[3:08:01] finish I want to tell you that I'm gonna
[3:08:03] miss you so
[3:08:10] much there had been a long time ago that
[3:08:13] hadn't been a sheep
[3:08:15] before being a sheep is very
[3:08:19] tremendous because if a sheep gets
[3:08:23] sick the pastor gets sick
[3:08:26] too and it it doesn't get
[3:08:29] healed until they see the sheep that is
[3:08:38] healed even though they don't
[3:08:42] complain
[3:08:44] they take the pain and the distress of
[3:08:46] your
[3:08:47] needs when you're a
[3:08:50] pastor you're going to remember this old
[3:08:54] man uh the the the the
[3:09:00] youth you have the most beautiful
[3:09:04] generation which is the final
[3:09:08] generation it is up to very few
[3:09:11] Believers and a lot of
[3:09:15] unbelievers that's what the prophet
[3:09:20] said there's
[3:09:22] few that are believers but
[3:09:26] many the
[3:09:28] unbelievers how many believers do we
[3:09:30] have
[3:09:34] here now how many live in this
[3:09:40] city and that the Lord has taken out
[3:09:47] out I believe that there's still going
[3:09:49] to be more because we still
[3:09:52] have because the as long as the
[3:09:59] Lord with Jesus we have the the right
[3:10:03] amount of
[3:10:04] seed as long as the last one comes in
[3:10:08] and we all
[3:10:10] leave this is not far away
[3:10:14] this is
[3:10:15] closer than what we
[3:10:18] think so don't let the cares of this
[3:10:21] world to kick you
[3:10:24] out and that you
[3:10:27] can you can enjoy as we enjoy this
[3:10:33] morning of a wonderful Supernatural
[3:10:37] sermon you cannot hear it
[3:10:40] everywhere it is a privilege to be in
[3:10:43] this
[3:10:49] place so to finish to
[3:10:53] close I want to thank you one more
[3:10:59] time what do I say to the Colombian
[3:11:02] people

[3:11:17] angels went with me on the way back to
[3:11:22] Colombia you can ask for as many angels
[3:11:25] as you
[3:11:26] need you have an angel next to
[3:11:32] you but the Lord allows you to ask for
