[59:35] but um lord knows we have what we
[59:38] need we have need of it
[59:43] how many here have ever made a vow or a
[59:46] promise
[59:47] let me see your hands make sure that
[59:51] that everybody you guys never make made
[59:53] a vow or promise
[59:57] you make a vow or a promise and uh
[1:00:02] my question is how many have ever made a
[1:00:05] vow or a promise and
[1:00:06] not kept it juantos guardado
[1:00:26] now that's that's pretty much everybody
[1:00:29] how many here have not
[1:00:30] at one point or another in their life
[1:00:32] have not kept devourer
[1:00:36] that's better okay i raised my hand too
[1:00:39] i think that we are all guilty
[1:00:42] my question is how many of you have made
[1:00:44] a vow and
[1:00:46] have kept it
[1:00:50] okay yeah i i think that i pray we all
[1:00:53] have
[1:00:54] also we live in a day where
[1:00:58] where not too many people keep their
[1:01:00] promises anymore
[1:01:04] everybody know that true somebody can
[1:01:07] tell you something today and tomorrow
[1:01:09] they forget what they told you
[1:01:12] oh they'll say i i didn't say that
[1:01:16] i didn't mean that there's always an
[1:01:19] excuse
[1:01:20] or a reason they people justify
[1:01:22] themselves
[1:01:50] and the majority of the time they cannot
[1:01:52] keep the promises either
[1:01:56] when we get into a bind now let's bring
[1:01:58] it a little closer
[1:02:01] whenever we get into a bind or something
[1:02:03] goes wrong in our life
[1:02:07] that's usually the time that we make the
[1:02:09] most promises
[1:02:13] yes or yes coc lord
[1:02:16] senor now i i know i'm not the only one
[1:02:18] jose
[1:02:32] there's a video that somebody had sent
[1:02:34] me a video
[1:02:36] and it shows a a a young a young man
[1:02:41] taking a lamb out of a
[1:02:44] a of a ditch
[1:03:26] we make so many promises to the lord
[1:03:53] because as human beings we're always
[1:03:55] looking to see what is
[1:04:24] don't misunderstand an unconditional
[1:04:26] covenant
[1:04:29] because even an unconditional covenant
[1:04:31] has conditions
[1:04:34] jesus said you
[1:04:38] continue in my
[1:04:50] when god made an unconditional covenant
[1:04:52] with abraham
[1:05:08] you can turn into matthew the fifth
[1:05:09] chapter the 33rd verse
[1:05:14] it simply tells us here it's implemented
[1:05:17] again ye have heard that it has been
[1:05:19] said by them of all time
[1:05:24] thou shalt not forswear thyself
[1:05:29] but shalt perform unto the lord thine
[1:05:31] oaths
[1:05:34] the
[1:05:46] anybody here know what perjury is
[1:05:49] one or two people who know those
[1:05:50] personas nobody three four few few
[1:05:52] people okay
[1:05:54] make sure you exercise your arms today
[1:05:57] get some answers here perjury is simply
[1:06:00] to make a a false statement
[1:06:02] under
[1:06:18] and the bible tells us here it is thou
[1:06:21] shalt not make
[1:06:25] it says thou shalt not forswear thyself
[1:06:27] this is not
[1:06:29] us the scripture is trying to tell us
[1:06:34] don't make false statements
[1:06:38] and not tell the lord you're going to do
[1:06:39] something
[1:06:42] don't even tell your brother you're
[1:06:44] going to do something
[1:06:58] mm-hmm the scripture is saying don't
[1:07:01] make false statements
[1:07:08] but perform unto the lord thy
[1:07:12] oath
[1:07:14] verse 34 says but i say unto you swear
[1:07:16] not at all
[1:07:19] neither by heaven for it is god's throne
[1:07:24] or by the earth for it is its footstool
[1:07:26] neither by jerusalem for it is the city
[1:07:28] of the great king.
[1:07:33] neither shalt swear by thy head because
[1:07:36] thou canst not
[1:07:37] make one hair white or black
[1:07:55] this morning i want you to get all these
[1:07:57] points
[1:08:00] can i have your uh your undivided
[1:08:01] attention
[1:08:03] all right follow me very closely i
[1:08:05] believe it'll be a help to you
[1:08:09] the first thing that we must establish
[1:08:10] in a nazarite vow
[1:08:14] what it is and the purpose for which
[1:08:18] it is made it's not just to say i'm
[1:08:22] going to make a vow
[1:08:23] no no there's a purpose behind it
[1:08:26] and this purpose is sacred yesterday
[1:08:30] something that many people don't know
[1:08:32] about today
[1:08:34] very hard to find people that that that
[1:08:37] that reverence the things of the lord
[1:08:42] let's find out in number six
[1:08:47] what was required for one to keep the
[1:08:50] vowel look
[1:09:00] amen and the lord spake unto moses
[1:09:03] saying
[1:09:03] speak unto the children of israel and
[1:09:06] say unto them
[1:09:11] when either a man or woman shall
[1:09:14] separate
[1:09:15] themselves
[1:09:19] i want you to notice this here
[1:09:22] there's something that we got to do and
[1:09:25] the first thing we do is we got to
[1:09:27] separate
[1:09:28] ourselves i want you to tell your
[1:09:31] neighbors a neighbor
[1:10:19] he shall separate himself from wine and
[1:10:22] strong drinks
[1:10:24] i shall drink no vinegar of wine or
[1:10:28] vinegar
[1:10:31] neither shall he drink any liquor of
[1:10:33] grapes
[1:10:35] nor eat moist grapes or dried grapes
[1:10:40] raisins right okay
[1:11:24] he separateth himself unto the lord
[1:11:29] he shall be holy and shall let the locks
[1:11:32] of the hair of his head grow
[1:11:38] all the days that he separateth himself
[1:11:40] unto the lord he shall come at no
[1:11:42] dead body
[1:11:48] right here an israelite
[1:11:52] who has taken
[1:12:06] us the needle we we we saw three things
[1:12:10] you abstain from eating or drinking
[1:12:12] anything from the vines
[1:12:17] no razor upon their head
[1:12:24] those were the three things of a
[1:12:27] nazarite vow
[1:12:29] these were the conditions of this
[1:12:32] particular vowel
[1:13:03] our our spiritual caps this morning
[1:13:10] was to separate themselves from all the
[1:13:14] world
[1:13:29] was to separate themselves from all the
[1:13:32] world
[1:13:34] but it was not just to separate from the
[1:13:36] world
[1:13:38] and this is what really brings another
[1:13:40] dimension to the nazareth
[1:13:44] god
[1:14:25] yeah you get that and
[1:14:40] what do you understand
[1:14:54] had
[1:15:21] people they stopped doing this or that
[1:15:26] they separate from this they separate
[1:15:28] from this group
[1:15:30] and they separate from that but but when
[1:15:33] it's all said and done
[1:15:35] the question is what have they
[1:16:02] keep that in mind because we're going to
[1:16:03] need that
[1:16:30] you didn't take a nazarite vow just
[1:16:45] so that you could separate or that could
[1:16:47] die out
[1:16:50] so that we could be quick into something
[1:16:52] else
[1:16:54] now watch this now one cannot unite with
[1:16:57] something or someone but
[1:17:00] unless first they are separated from
[1:17:02] something or someone else
[1:17:05] and it's not just to separate from
[1:17:08] something you know
[1:17:10] but it's to separate to something
[1:17:14] i'm going to get
[1:17:42] so that you can just dress differently
[1:17:45] or you can look different or just for
[1:17:48] the sake of being different
[1:17:52] why do your young girls wear long long
[1:17:54] dresses
[1:17:56] and have their hair long serviced is it
[1:17:58] just to be different from everybody
[1:18:02] if that's the case yes you'll miss
[1:18:05] something somewhere
[1:18:06] else well i do because my
[1:18:09] mom and dad tell me
[1:18:22] you are called to join yourself to the
[1:18:25] word
[1:18:27] but you can't unless you've separated
[1:18:29] from the world
[1:18:34] is one that is consecrated to a specific
[1:18:38] age is
[1:19:20] oh
[1:19:35] unto the lord what a nice thing that
[1:19:39] would be
[1:19:41] i tell you it's not only
[1:19:44] possible no solo is possible but it's
[1:19:47] necessary
[1:19:48] necessarily
[1:20:02] who's the first what's the first
[1:20:04] character that comes into your mind
[1:20:07] when you hear azeroth
[1:20:11] just just let the young people okay i
[1:20:14] know some of you want to say it
[1:20:20] young people openness anyone
[1:20:23] at any time you can go ahead and say it
[1:20:36] he's probably even though many many
[1:20:37] people did the nazarite
[1:20:41] but samson is probably the one that was
[1:20:43] that we think of right away
[1:20:47] amen amen now now when we
[1:20:50] see this we all know the story very well
[1:20:55] you all know the story of samson very
[1:20:56] much
[1:20:58] you all very well okay want to make sure
[1:21:01] if not we'll go over the story again
[1:21:05] brother branham said in the message of
[1:21:06] wedding supper
[1:21:10] he said samson was a type of the holy
[1:21:13] ghost church
[1:21:18] keep that in mind now though the church
[1:21:22] is a woman it is also typified as a son
[1:21:26] typically
[1:21:35] we're getting this foundation done now
[1:21:41] and the lords of the philistines came up
[1:21:43] unto her this is delilah
[1:21:45] this is dalilah and said unto her
[1:21:48] entice him
[1:21:54] that sounds like the serpent and eva
[1:21:58] he doesn't change his way but entice him
[1:22:03] and see wherein his great strength lieth
[1:22:08] information
[1:22:22] and by what means may we prevail against
[1:22:25] him
[1:22:27] that we may bind him to afflict him
[1:22:32] and we will give the every one of us
[1:22:34] eleven hundred
[1:22:35] pieces of silver
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:23:04] i
[1:23:14] and that secret is what we heard brother
[1:23:16] fabio preach the other day secretary
[1:23:45] it really makes a lot of sense after a
[1:23:47] while
[1:23:48] he's after secrets
[1:23:52] valuable information information
[1:23:59] it's stored in safe
[1:24:15] and he wants to get to your information
[1:24:20] now there's a lot coming in there's a
[1:24:22] lot coming up
[1:24:25] he knows or he wants to know
[1:24:37] he don't care where you go to church you
[1:24:40] don't care how long you've been going to
[1:24:42] church
[1:25:09] the power of a vow
[1:25:25] no longer because i didn't like the face
[1:25:28] but i don't go talk to him then the next
[1:25:30] time i say brother henry i'm going to do
[1:25:31] this
[1:25:34] there's no trust there's no power there
[1:25:37] there's no connection there
[1:25:52] when i say something
[1:26:06] is
[1:26:34] knows the power
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:27:02] make
[1:27:14] you see so many things going on
[1:27:30] i was talking with brother jerry jerry
[1:27:33] gonzalez he's helping me out here
[1:27:35] he's a specialist in his field
[1:27:37] especially
[1:27:38] and he knows about computers about
[1:27:41] attacks
[1:27:43] and those of you that that read the
[1:27:58] so that the
[1:28:12] so many different companies
[1:28:27] and it says it's a type of a malicious
[1:28:30] software
[1:28:31] yes designed to block
[1:28:34] access to a computer system
[1:28:40] and they keep it blocked
[1:28:53] and they'll say you want your files
[1:28:56] pay us ten million dollars for the
[1:28:59] companies
[1:29:04] that's right come on take it to the
[1:29:06] spiritual network
[1:29:08] there are things that the enemy is doing
[1:29:12] now what it does is it encrypts the
[1:29:15] victim's files
[1:29:18] [Music]
[1:29:21] it's the same as when
[1:30:18] i'm trying to make it in a way that you
[1:30:19] all understand
[1:30:21] he takes your files and he holds them
[1:30:25] hostage he's waiting for
[1:30:28] us unless a ransom is paid
[1:30:46] of your identity
[1:30:50] out of it until you pay it
[1:30:54] yes like you say they won't release it
[1:30:58] oh this ransomware is
[1:31:46] just a little bit i'm just going to tell
[1:31:47] you a little bit so let me tell you
[1:31:48] what's going on in my life
[1:31:52] the next thing you know it you don't
[1:31:53] talk to that person no more
[1:31:56] that person knows everything about you
[1:31:57] yes
[1:31:59] and now they start to blackmail you
[1:32:02] and now they start to tell others about
[1:32:04] you
[1:32:06] and then we're in the middle of this
[1:32:07] drama
[1:32:09] we don't know what to do
[1:32:24] we forget our promises we forget
[1:32:27] everything
[1:32:29] but then when he has you know
[1:32:32] then once the email is open
[1:32:36] a file is downloaded so
[1:32:52] hacked and how to get out of that
[1:32:56] condition it's hard
[1:32:59] deficiency because a lot of times you
[1:33:00] lose data
[1:33:03] it's called for us amnesia is

[1:36:02] come on church we got to close up all
[1:36:04] these entrances

[1:38:14] say it again
[1:38:55] to them gave he power
[1:38:59] to become sons of god
[1:39:03] watch what brother branham says in the
[1:39:04] message of preparation
[1:39:08] but there's a mystery

[1:39:29] the holy ghost church and there's a
[1:39:32] mystery

[1:40:45] about samson
[1:40:47] you mistake yourself you want to know
[1:40:48] the estimation my estimation about him

[1:40:55] headed shrimp samson
[1:40:59] mystery huh give me steady you say
[1:41:28] he picked up these doors
[1:41:44] no that wasn't samson
[1:41:48] brother branham says he was he was maybe
[1:41:52] he said possible
[1:41:57] you look about five feet huh there
[1:42:12] taking off
[1:42:25] the source of his power
[1:42:30] and we're just church members it looks
[1:42:33] like
[1:42:34] it's almost memorable we go to church
[1:42:38] and all that's wonderful you gotta do
[1:42:40] those things
[1:42:54] the most powerful
[1:43:28] that would be that would be such a sight
[1:43:31] to see huh
[1:43:33] what are these days or when brother
[1:43:35] branham meets up with samson but the
[1:43:36] manufacturing
[1:43:50] yes
[1:44:47] wow now watch this now
[1:44:50] it's a mystery and he was that
[1:44:54] until the spirit of the lord
[1:44:59] got a hold of him you say brother are
[1:45:01] you not afraid of things
[1:45:04] there are things we're all human beings
[1:45:06] but when the holy spirit comes upon the
[1:45:09] person
[1:45:10] and takes control of my memories
[1:45:42] come on church i'm going to say it again
[1:45:44] first thing that he would do
[1:45:46] hey reach back is god seeing my luck
[1:45:51] okay they're still there okay come on
[1:46:07] now think about this for a moment as he
[1:46:10] as the spirit
[1:46:41] [Applause]
[1:46:52] and a lock is not
[1:47:04] keeps a mystery
[1:47:20] his parents and
[1:47:32] make sure the locks were still there
[1:47:46] can you imagine the power that went
[1:47:48] through samson's
[1:48:02] identified
[1:48:16] man that's born of the holy spirit to
[1:48:18] fill the power of god
[1:48:21] and know that it's the covenant to slay
[1:48:24] the enemy before you
[1:48:29] watch when he says
[1:49:12] oh
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:53] how could he be so sure
[1:50:50] but
[1:51:04] that but watch this now
[1:51:08] three and i don't want to go because
[1:51:10] then it'll take me too much time
[1:51:11] the the three things that he told her
[1:51:15] and then it brought him to the fourth
[1:51:16] which was to shave the locks
[1:52:14] this is what samson said in verse 20.
[1:52:18] they said the philistines be upon you
[1:52:20] samson
[1:52:22] and he awoke out of his sleep
[1:52:25] and said i will go out at the other
[1:52:27] times before
[1:52:41] we go and live any kind of life
[1:52:55] he's a good god he's a gracious god
[1:52:58] i'll go to church i'll go to the office
[1:53:00] raise my hands up
[1:53:02] and then i'll shake myself and it'll be
[1:53:04] like every other time that i did
[1:53:06] when i went to church no big deal
[1:53:20] the presence of the lord
[1:53:37] because the presence of
[1:53:46] [Applause]
[1:53:51] sometimes worse i
[1:54:06] the lord had departed from him
[1:54:10] as long as god can see those seven locks
[1:54:14] he sees his promise oh yes he's
[1:54:17] obligated to his words
[1:55:15] the world has shaved off your
[1:55:17] peculiarness
[1:55:20] until you have become one of them
[1:55:25] that you can't tell the difference
[1:55:26] between a so-called christian and a
[1:55:28] worldly personality
[1:55:56] what the world has done
[1:56:26] but the world shaved yours
[1:56:30] now you're just as starchy as the rest
[1:56:33] of it
[1:56:36] nothing moves you nothing starchy
[1:56:43] and when the church begins to keep
[1:56:45] company with the world
[1:56:48] company then it's no more than the world
[1:56:52] it gets out of fellowship with the holy
[1:56:54] spirit
[1:57:09] oh when did the church start flirting
[1:57:12] when he began to try to pattern itself
[1:57:14] after the world
[1:57:17] park you see the successes that the
[1:57:19] world can offer
[1:57:22] we've never been ordained of god to try
[1:57:24] to keep in step with the world
[1:57:29] after the day of pentecost the church
[1:57:32] fell at night when they were wooed by
[1:57:36] the enemy
[1:58:03] but one day
[1:58:14] he was blind church they were blind
[1:58:18] the dark ages
[1:58:31] preaches the message
[1:58:44] but just one more time
[1:58:48] [Applause]
[1:59:14] and i'm gonna tell you every one of you
[1:59:16] understand when the
[1:59:17] message came to us
[1:59:23] let the enemy shave your hair
[1:59:28] it's
[1:59:43] it's just antiques yeah that old fashion
[1:59:45] is what's going to take us home
[1:59:49] [Applause]

[1:59:53] that
[1:59:55] but i ain't stopping they don't know
[1:59:56] what yeah
[2:00:10] that's why the
[2:00:23] [Applause]
[2:00:25] church he gave us seven eyes
[2:00:28] which are the seven messengers i'm going
[2:00:31] to get to that in a moment
