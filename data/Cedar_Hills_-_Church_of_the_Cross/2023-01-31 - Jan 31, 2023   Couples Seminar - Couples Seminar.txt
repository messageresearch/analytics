TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign deal with that stabilizing make some movies all right to do it [Music] huh oh yeah [Music] thank you thank you thank you yeah if you wanna on a transition it was like my transition right I'm going to do this I don't know foreign [Applause] bless you and welcome to all of you and foreign increase it is [Music] we watch your words [Music] the thing that we have today is called the family [Applause] these first two things the family to understand what is a home now we're gonna understand we're going to go into specific points more directly in their homes sorry engage somebody have an idea person [Music] my God it was the purpose okay there was that place or he created a place it is oh hopelessness come to the mind of God and let's bring this picture yeah that there was a Unity [Music] when God places there was a union or a Unity because they have part of this nature I don't believe sometimes being so too precious foreign and I think over time you're so beautiful [Music] oh my God foreign [Music] foreign Jesus now there's a precious voice my children good evening are you enjoying the creation are you enjoying what I have created for you okay what do you say my children what a beautiful moment this is a Unity this is perfection it's one plus one plus one and it equals this is what God wanted in the beginning now open your eyes do you see why it's so important the family to God knowing the plan of God he also has an objective and it is Genesis chapter 12 tells us every pain every wrong thing now just imagine okay foreign [Music] Abraham and he said I promise because God once again wants to have communion with the family but it's for the generations see how important the family is that God can perpetually forgive His blessings and the children of the children do you see why the family it's a link it's the link if that link is weak Ness the plan that God has with that family is there any questions to this point no question when God calls Abram s [Music] but it wasn't just for him but it was for his children now in this time we are the seat of Abraham when I read in Genesis I was not just talking about Abraham a great nation maybe not everybody has had the privilege to be raised in a Christian home but we have had the honors [Music] to know the love of God through Christ and that places [Music] names and holiness foreign how important we are in the chain of God when we say eyes these are baby things God gives it to every one of you what's your name Andrew what was the promise that God Made You we just read it yeah a great nation what is the promise that God has for your for your life what would your answer be foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] that gives us promises that he will also be the god of our children somebody has to have a question somebody has something they want to say Hallelujah foreign but uh to a separation and Abraham he has to pair price [Music] do you see the importance yes the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is always spoken we have a very important job this morning the Lord showed me something e e here I was coming into the scholarship home and I saw three prayers where they put the children the babies yeah and there were three children just little children and they also I'll use his enemies and between 8 and 16 months it's a vision Hollywood and God wants you to teach something I saw these children and the first child and I saw that this this child was influenced by demons [Music] being influenced by these spirits to change my generation I want you to put yourself in my shoes and ask yourself the same questions could those be your grandchildren do you know those those grandchildren were already lost for the families [Music] I will be the god of your generation that promise was lost I don't want that to happen in my life maybe I don't read the Bible enough to my children names [Music] and that is gonna negatively uh have a negative effect to my children we it's almost we are the example so our children is my wife knows that I'm not living that right that God has elected me and has chosen to make me a great nation and I have a promise to my children and I want my children for them to run that they thought that I knew he always be the same God they also know him by revelations to that point have you understood yes so is this the reason that he will always refer to himself I am the god of Abraham right absolutely make sure that we know this is Generations okay I'm in um a God that loves his family he asked Abraham just to obey him be perfect you know what Perfection is [Music] supposed to say he's the one that fills the requirements for you all he's asking of us is to be obedient it's that's it the same fellowship or communion [Music] today you and I can have the same time through Jesus Christ did you capture it we're in the same position [Music] that communion with God for kids because and God cannot be there the husband and the wife must be immunity the children with the parents the parents with the children that gives us a Unity so that the Holy Spirit can come down then that's why he says the families that pray together they stay together you have a question you know I was reading a story today and the story was about a family and one day they had an uncle that came and visited and he was a Christian and so they pray for the moon the the uncle left and so the next time they got together to eat he said that the dad jumped in it was about to and by this is that is God not God today my children depending the knee they make pandemic the decision that I will make my grandchildren okay that I don't even know they are depending on the decisions [Music] [Music] but they will also are they are depending on the decisions I'm making today once again I I promise myself today me and my house we will serve the Lord if there's something that today you feel something in your heart okay for what we have heard that was this Vision that we have that we have that we have shown us I want to change that scene full of the Holy Ghost not not full of spirits having a Passion to serve the Lord show them the correct way to bring Christ on the scene me and my house we will serve the Lord that wants to change the scene amen amen it's gonna be the same as Abraham we're gonna have to pay the price or yes those that come from a Christian home your father's Peter price some of us that maybe that didn't come from we have paid a price so that we could be here gave him [Music] I will bless your seed or your Generations so that one day those words oh that's right one day my son would say father I am going to serve the god that you serve [Music] that would be the greatest I had a dream last night God called me that your daughter Lily got mama would say did you call me no no he's faithful he is faithful Satan will not have mercy foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] they want to ask um how many children do you have two come on how do you see them in the future I see them preaching and serving the lord they have to grow up here that will never leave them one day and I'll make of you Brother David how many children do you have problems how do you see them in the future man I remember with all these promises oh my God that is a promise yeah how will they get there you gotta show them by your example how they're gonna get there and I know how many children are you going to have brothers soon as artists writing and creating things for the Lord using their gifts I think that we're accomplishing the objective today the biggest lie that is the biggest thing because I want them to have the best we give it to our children and everything in six years they destroyed everything okay I'll see the the real thing that's important [Music] with God you have to have an experience with him just like Abraham and the way that Jacob had inside and Isaacs because it's a promise you and your generation is there anything that you would want to say you would like to add anyone yeah what tremendous lesson that we have heard now I as I as I'm hearing the Holy Spirit speak to us there's so many things that you get flooded with when you're hearing these things and it's so true I remember speaking one day to a man he said this he says you know we need to learn that if our fathers they have a quarrel between them he says that doesn't mean that that their children have to be fighting too they should never transfer this is one of the biggest mistakes we make with our children we have a problem or an issue [Music] your children my children should not have to carry that in life thank you foreign that Spirit of drinking always follows still in the place foreign [Music] [Music] very important that you understand because you want them to have an opportunity now back in the old days in the biblical days when the father was or the the parents were a certain way the Bible says that they would that he would visit the the iniquity of the parents three and four generations and so we look at that and we're like wow through the years and this is the thing that we're grateful to God is that those curses can be broken [Music] one of the things that God would even give our children that he would give our children they don't have to be something because their parents or grandparents now they can choose for themselves remember don't make them carry stuff that you carry me here's another mistake that parents make this I'm talking about a homeless they'll tell their children everything that they did wrong growing up videos don't make your children carry those things it does nothing to help them okay [Music] you're fine he was he was a young a young dad and his first of course they had 14 13 children and the first part in the first half of the of these children they knew my grandfather that answered the Lord but the second half of these children my grandfather as a Godly Man [Music] and I remember even hearing this [Music] my older uncles and my dad I don't care who cares once again don't let them don't make them carry stuff that they don't have to do okay yes instead of prayers [Music] as for me and my house we will serve the Lord let's ask God to help us to to fulfill this this content that we've made it to be parents that are of a good example that if there is another generation that it would be another generation that would continue with this man I'm gonna ask God to forgive my failures foreign thank you for these words that there would be fire in every one of these words so that our hearts can burn the the desire to be obedient and the examples to our children in the name of the Lord Jesus [Applause] and when I say intimacy [Music] between couples I love you my friend any questions foreign
