[36:55] scriptures in the book of Exodus chapter
[37:00] 33 but before reading the
[37:05] scripture let us go before the author of
[37:07] the
[37:11] word to ask for the guidance of God in
[37:14] this
[37:16] evening blessed and good Heavenly
[37:23] Father we give you thanks for one more
[37:25] day of Health and
[37:28] life we're gathered here in this
[37:34] place to worship and glorify your Holy
[37:39] Name we're going to open this
[37:46] word but we want to ask you that you add
[37:49] the blessings to the reading of
[37:52] it our hearts are
[37:55] open
[37:57] for you to give us your
[38:00] word that you may be the one who
[38:02] minister in this
[38:05] evening that you may be in each brother
[38:07] and
[38:09] sister that your Holy Spirit may move in
[38:12] the
[38:15] audience if there is someone sick that
[38:17] you may heal him by Your
[38:21] Word we only put ourselves in your
[38:25] hands surrender for your
[38:29] service in the name of our Lord Jesus
[38:32] Christ amen
[38:36] amen the word of God
[38:40] says Exodus 33 verse
[38:52] 15 and he said unto him If thy presence
[38:55] go not with with me carry us not up
[39:15] hands for wherein shall it be known here
[39:18] that I and thy people have found Grace
[39:20] in thy sight is it not that is it not in
[39:24] that thou goest with us so shall be
[39:27] separated I and thy people from all the
[39:30] people that are upon the face of the
[39:43] earth and the Lord said unto Moses I
[39:45] will do this thing also that thou Hast
[39:48] spoken for thou has found Grace in my
[39:50] side and I Know Thee by
[39:55] name
[39:58] may the Lord add the blessings to to the
[40:00] reading of his
[40:02] word may be
[40:06] seated I want to thank our pastor for
[40:08] the
[40:10] opportunity for permitting us to be in
[40:13] this
[40:17] place so this conversation that Moses is
[40:21] having he is not talking to any
[40:25] person
[40:28] he is talking nothing else but but to
[40:31] the
[40:34] Lord he is talking to the Eternal
[40:38] God he was coming from a walk in the
[40:43] Wilder they had gone through a lot of
[40:45] Trials and
[40:50] tests right after they left
[40:55] Egypt
[40:57] the first time Israel was already
[41:02] murmuring but there's something
[41:04] important that the word of God is
[41:09] speaking and Moses puts a condition on
[41:14] God and him being the prophet
[41:19] says he had a calling to take the people
[41:22] to the promised
[41:24] land he had seen the hand and the
[41:27] marvels of
[41:28] God but it came to a
[41:32] point he reached a part of
[41:36] desperation that he said if your
[41:37] presence is not with me I will not take
[41:40] a step
[41:41] forward do not not move me from here I'm
[41:45] better
[41:46] here until your presence is with
[41:50] me and then he said in this shall you
[41:54] know that I have found Grace
[41:58] in this evening brother and
[41:59] sister first thing we want to do is to
[42:03] find
[42:04] grace before the eyes of God for
[42:08] we we don't want to give a step
[42:11] forward we don't want to
[42:13] leave we don't want to
[42:17] move his presence is not with
[42:21] us Moses moving forward in this
[42:25] journey
[42:27] he said I don't want to know anything
[42:29] else but number
[42:32] one that I have found Grace in thy
[42:36] sight and that thou walk with us and
[42:40] that me and thy
[42:42] people they that you walk with
[42:45] us but the answer comes from
[42:48] God I shall be with the I'll walk with
[42:54] thee you must be
[42:56] I separated people from the rest of the
[42:59] people God doesn't
[43:01] want he does not
[43:04] desire it is not within
[43:08] God to share his glory with
[43:11] anyone he wants you and you
[43:14] alone he's not calling anyone
[43:18] else when he's knocking at the
[43:21] door he knocking at your heart for you
[43:25] to open your
[43:27] door or his presence to go with
[43:32] you now for you to find grace before
[43:35] God for me to find grace before
[43:38] God I should please God for for me to
[43:42] please God we all
[43:45] know and we repeat it by memory without
[43:49] faith it is impossible to please
[43:53] God we can't recite it one once and one
[43:56] once
[43:58] again but Apostle Peter is teaching us
[44:02] that
[44:03] we when we have
[44:06] faith or when we advance in
[44:09] faith there's a very important
[44:13] point that Apostle Peter teaches us and
[44:16] he's
[44:18] saying first Peter
[44:21] 1:6 where you greatly
[44:25] rejoice though now for a
[44:30] season if need be ye are in heaviness
[44:33] through many full
[44:35] Temptation this word
[44:38] heaviness it it catches my
[44:42] attention the word
[44:45] Afflicted causing
[44:50] oppression it's something that's going
[44:52] to wear you
[44:54] out and it's going to give give you
[44:56] sadness at the same
[44:58] time it it's going to give you
[45:02] discomfort it's going to give you
[45:03] physical
[45:05] suffering that's what having an
[45:07] Affliction
[45:09] means so for a for a short period of
[45:13] time we must be
[45:17] afflicted we must have
[45:21] discomfort not every not all life we're
[45:24] going to have comfortness
[45:26] we must have a physical
[45:29] suffering that the
[45:32] trial that the
[45:36] trial the trial of your
[45:40] faith being much more precious than a
[45:45] gold we can see that in all the
[45:51] scriptures where everyone who pleased
[45:54] God they had to come to this
[45:58] point of putting their faith to
[46:02] test we all can say we have
[46:10] faith but what about the day that our
[46:12] faith has to be
[46:18] tested that's what the people of God had
[46:20] experienced in the walking in the
[46:23] wilderness they wanted to go to the
[46:30] land they wanted to go to a land flowing
[46:33] with milk and
[46:35] honey they were going in that
[46:37] walk but they did not
[46:41] know for them to please
[46:44] God you don't please God with anything
[46:48] else but having
[46:50] faith so when you have
[46:53] faith now your faith needs to be
[46:57] it must be tested with
[46:59] Affliction with
[47:06] trials as to The Heroes of
[47:11] Faith I want to share a quote from the
[47:14] [Applause]
[47:19] prophet the messenger the the message
[47:22] God's covenant with Abraham and his
[47:24] seat
[47:26] God does not make any difference between
[47:28] his
[47:29] children we are all sons of
[47:33] God he's not gonna make a distinction of
[47:39] anyone for you for him you are his
[47:43] daughter you are his daughter you are
[47:46] his
[47:48] son and we all before the presence of
[47:50] God
[47:51] are he does not make any
[47:54] difference but every son that cometh to
[47:58] God must first be
[48:01] tried it has to be
[48:04] punished now the word
[48:07] Whi it's not just anything
[48:12] else it is to beat someone
[48:16] repetitively to beat someone
[48:20] violently once and once
[48:24] again very negative effects in a person
[48:28] but in that way your faith my faith must
[48:33] be
[48:34] tested
[48:36] God he doesn't want any person like his
[48:39] children if you cannot bear with the
[48:42] with a
[48:45] child keep this in your
[48:49] heart you must be afflicted
[48:54] first you must be be
[48:59] whipped so you can go through the
[49:01] process of of
[49:06] trial the bud when it produces
[49:09] fruits before producing the
[49:12] fruit God purchase it
[49:16] first God cleans it out
[49:19] first that removes all the old
[49:23] leaves removes the branches that are
[49:28] useless it's a hurtful
[49:32] situation when it the shaking
[49:39] comes it's not a a cause to be
[49:43] happy but after that it has the
[49:47] fruit God does
[49:49] that for you and
[49:52] I to produce fruit fruit
[49:56] 100
[49:58] fold now
[50:00] look the the Bible
[50:03] says the trials and
[50:06] temptations are
[50:09] wonderful and they're even much more
[50:11] precious than
[50:13] gold have you ever ever been scourged or
[50:17] whipped a
[50:19] whip
[50:21] imagine it's not just beating up
[50:27] God that's how he does with his
[50:31] children and I wanted to ask a question
[50:33] this
[50:34] year how many are children of
[50:37] God being a child of God has a
[50:43] process it is a
[50:45] discipline the prophet
[50:49] says You must be
[50:52] whipped and you must be disciplined
[50:56] what is the word
[50:58] discipline we saw that the word
[51:03] whip is when a person is whip
[51:09] whipped is when that person is beaten
[51:12] repetitively and
[51:15] violently and after he went through that
[51:19] process after he
[51:21] still he says
[51:23] Lord whatever you say
[51:26] Lord that is a child that
[51:29] has now discipline
[51:31] comes
[51:34] God that gives him a set of
[51:38] norms and
[51:41] rules to follow in a
[51:46] behavior and to keep order before
[51:53] people God didn't choose
[51:56] you God didn't choose
[51:58] us to polish you to order you to
[52:03] discipline
[52:05] you and then keep you here down here
[52:08] where
[52:09] nobody
[52:12] usess God
[52:20] disciplines to show us up before people
[52:23] and say behold my
[52:26] behold my
[52:28] daughter in whom I am
[52:30] well it's not
[52:33] me it is not the
[52:35] person but as
[52:38] people if we could stop seeing the flesh
[52:43] this flesh is going to
[52:46] fail but we have to do
[52:48] this to tear up the the
[52:51] flesh to go beyond the veil of Flesh and
[52:55] see that
[52:56] inside there's a son and the daughter of
[52:59] God tested by
[53:03] time but that is what I have to do not
[53:06] seeing the
[53:08] flesh flesh is going to make
[53:10] mistakes flesh
[53:12] fails flesh is going to
[53:14] forget flesh
[53:16] stumbles that's what flesh is but inside
[53:20] the flesh there's
[53:23] a there's a
[53:26] that God
[53:28] hased every heart of human
[53:30] being and if my
[53:34] eyes don't have enough Revelation to see
[53:37] that there's a severe problem with
[53:42] me the brother is not fighting his own
[53:45] battle by
[53:47] himself that's why there are brothers
[53:49] and sister to help
[53:53] them because we're
[53:56] Army it's not the brother against the
[53:59] brother it's not the sister against the
[54:03] sister That's what Satan has
[54:06] placed he has tried to bring
[54:10] dissension but the Son of
[54:13] God goes beyond the
[54:15] veil he goes beyond the
[54:18] veil he looks
[54:21] more and he looks at a son God a
[54:24] daughter of God
[54:26] purchased by blood to the price of
[54:30] pain where eternity is found and this
[54:36] eternity United with this other
[54:38] eternity and in this moment it
[54:43] becomes the Gathering of the
[54:47] Gods if you do not believe
[54:54] it
[54:56] is because you need your faith to be
[55:00] tested but we are
[55:03] sitting we are
[55:05] sitting in Heavenly
[55:10] places and I repeat it
[55:12] again we are
[55:14] sitting in Heavenly
[55:19] places and we are
[55:22] sitting with Christ Jesus
[55:25] in who in who my brother my
[55:30] sister that's where Christ
[55:33] Jesus the holy spirit is in
[55:36] him heaped him he baptized
[55:43] him what I have to go is to go be Beyond
[55:46] the Veil of
[55:48] FL to go beyond the veil of
[55:52] Flesh he's not against me
[55:55] I am not against him
[55:58] united we are
[56:00] against an
[56:02] enemy it comes as a
[56:05] flood if you could
[56:07] imagine the word
[56:09] River it comes to tear apart to
[56:14] destroy to
[56:17] remove to
[56:19] dissolve to
[56:21] divide That's what Satan is becomes as a
[56:24] flaw
[56:26] the spirit of the
[56:29] Lord a standard now you and I
[56:35] no we we are like David
[56:38] was when he wrote Psalm
[56:42] 42 he was in trials and
[56:45] test he was in
[56:48] Affliction he said why all my soul oh my
[56:52] soul why why are you discouraged with
[56:56] in the
[56:57] Lord upon the
[57:03] Lord why you this courage within me all
[57:06] my
[57:08] soul wait upon the
[57:11] Lord why are you cast down on my
[57:16] soul if if you one one
[57:20] time notice
[57:23] this l
[57:26] let
[57:29] God remove those old old
[57:34] branches those old
[57:38] leaves that old that old branches that
[57:42] they are
[57:44] useless they're not good for
[57:47] anything they're only their
[57:50] hindering let God Purge you let God
[57:54] remove it
[57:56] let God move you as
[58:00] job he had every everything he had was
[58:04] destroyed in such a way that he didn't
[58:08] know where he was
[58:11] going that's where he found himself in
[58:13] that condition he only
[58:16] said the Lord God had
[58:19] taken the Lord God had
[58:21] given blessed be the name of the Lord
[58:25] his children have been
[58:27] slaughtered it's not anything
[58:30] else it's receiving a
[58:34] whiping beit with
[58:36] violence but he certain of who God
[58:41] was and Moses he was certain of who God
[58:45] was that's why he
[58:48] said if your pres does not go with
[58:50] me if thy presence is not with me do not
[58:54] move me from
[58:56] I don't want to
[58:57] move I'm not going to give a step
[58:59] forward until your presence is with me
[59:04] but
[59:06] you you must found find grace before the
[59:08] eyes of
[59:10] God and for you to find grace before the
[59:13] eyes of God
[59:15] remember there's only one way and that
[59:19] is with faith God bless
[59:23] you
[59:44] am man God bless you this fine
[59:47] evening can you give one to the
[59:51] Lord amen what a amen what a
[59:55] word amen what I was back there
[59:58] listening to brother
[1:00:00] Salvador you know he was talking about
[1:00:03] us being in Heavenly
[1:00:08] places you know and and um everybody was
[1:00:14] shocked
[1:00:16] dead no reaction
[1:00:19] no you know but we have to believe
[1:00:22] that you know we have to believe that
[1:00:24] we're in Heavenly
[1:00:27] places you know we got to take it for
[1:00:29] what it's
[1:00:32] worth God
[1:00:35] comes and he wants to bless
[1:00:38] us so what's the
[1:00:41] problem what's so hard to take that
[1:00:46] Faith to take that faith and use
[1:00:51] it we're afraid many times to use God's
[1:00:56] faith are we in Heavenly places right
[1:01:01] now did you bring your portion
[1:01:05] tonight you know I I know brother Tommy
[1:01:07] says this a
[1:01:09] lot he says we are living
[1:01:13] below our god-given
[1:01:17] privilege we are living the the the
[1:01:20] presence of
[1:01:22] God the blessings of God
[1:01:26] he wants to give them to
[1:01:28] us you know I was thinking about
[1:01:30] something
[1:01:31] today you know we see and we hear many
[1:01:36] times the prophet of God says they
[1:01:41] longed to be sitting where you're
[1:01:45] sitting they long to be in this
[1:01:49] day and many times we
[1:01:52] look and we take it for what it's
[1:01:56] worth but Church you know we are living
[1:02:00] in a
[1:02:01] day we are living in an
[1:02:04] hour last
[1:02:06] week it's better
[1:02:10] today for one step closer to going
[1:02:14] home you cannot tell
[1:02:16] me that the word that's being brought
[1:02:20] forth is more
[1:02:23] powerful you've ever heard
[1:02:26] before you say no brother we heard
[1:02:29] better
[1:02:31] word God is
[1:02:34] Progressive he gives us what we
[1:02:37] need and this day it's a special
[1:02:42] day not
[1:02:44] yesterday it already passed but what God
[1:02:48] has for us
[1:02:51] today what he has today it's
[1:02:56] special
[1:02:58] special say he's knocking on your
[1:03:01] heart but he said don't Harden your
[1:03:05] heart we got to take his
[1:03:08] word for what it's
[1:03:10] worth because tonight we're going to
[1:03:12] talk about
[1:03:15] something God gave me a
[1:03:18] message and in this message he told
[1:03:21] me when their eyes met
[1:03:26] that's where it
[1:03:28] started he said I want you to imagine
[1:03:33] something imagine when John the
[1:03:37] Baptist for the first
[1:03:40] time his eyes met
[1:03:45] Jesus he said what do you think was
[1:03:49] happening we talked about this
[1:03:53] day family Pastor talked about this
[1:03:57] day he said it's going to be a great
[1:04:00] day he said it's going to be a day of a
[1:04:04] manifestation that this word I'm
[1:04:08] preaching it will come to
[1:04:10] pass there will be
[1:04:13] maturity there will be a
[1:04:16] bride that has made herself
[1:04:19] ready but the problem we looked to
[1:04:23] yesterday but I could
[1:04:26] imagine John
[1:04:28] preached of a Christ that was
[1:04:32] coming from the
[1:04:34] day that he could be barely survived by
[1:04:40] himself he left his
[1:04:42] home how many years we don't
[1:04:45] know but he was in the
[1:04:47] wilderness God talked to
[1:04:50] him he saw a
[1:04:52] vision he saw something
[1:04:55] great something great that was
[1:04:58] coming but one
[1:05:01] day he met his eyes with
[1:05:04] Christ he said he is the Son of
[1:05:07] God he is that
[1:05:10] lamb something
[1:05:13] happened but what about me that was John
[1:05:17] the
[1:05:18] Baptist but what about
[1:05:21] us what about
[1:05:23] today
[1:05:25] what about it it's your
[1:05:28] day you know I'll tell you
[1:05:30] Church the messages that our pastor has
[1:05:35] preached I don't know about
[1:05:38] you but they rocked my
[1:05:42] world he made a
[1:05:46] statement are you
[1:05:49] guessing if your name is written in the
[1:05:52] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:05:55] or are you
[1:05:58] sure that it's
[1:06:00] there he says it's too
[1:06:03] late to be
[1:06:05] guessing to be
[1:06:08] wondering because many times that's what
[1:06:11] we
[1:06:12] do we go through
[1:06:15] life and we want to put everything
[1:06:18] before
[1:06:21] God and we have these stupid
[1:06:27] thoughts what are we doing going to
[1:06:31] church is this God
[1:06:35] real and these thoughts come
[1:06:39] in what are we
[1:06:41] doing are we sleeping in
[1:06:44] church do we come to church whenever we
[1:06:47] want do we not take it for what it's
[1:06:52] worth if God is who he says he
[1:06:56] is then he's got to do
[1:07:00] something his word has got to
[1:07:03] do what it says it will
[1:07:09] do John chapter
[1:07:13] 14 even the spirit of
[1:07:17] Truth whom the world cannot
[1:07:21] receive because it seeth him not
[1:07:25] neither knoweth
[1:07:27] him but ye know
[1:07:30] him for he dwelleth in
[1:07:34] you and shall be in
[1:07:37] you on church that's got to make it
[1:07:40] alive to
[1:07:42] you this was
[1:07:44] then but that word is being
[1:07:49] manifest it's got to mean something to
[1:07:52] us he says I will leave you
[1:07:59] comfortless is that what it says
[1:08:03] oh we're not in a hurry
[1:08:06] tonight see when I
[1:08:09] speak I can say what brother Jimmy says
[1:08:11] in half the
[1:08:15] time I may leave The Interpreter behind
[1:08:18] once in a
[1:08:21] while so let's let's get hold of
[1:08:25] this says I will
[1:08:29] not leave you
[1:08:33] comfortless I will
[1:08:36] come to
[1:08:39] you let's let's take God's
[1:08:42] word tonight let's make it
[1:08:47] produce what it says it's going to
[1:08:51] produce in me Amen in me
[1:08:54] okay take it come
[1:08:58] on this is what it says it's going to
[1:09:02] do he said yet a little
[1:09:06] while and the world seeth me no
[1:09:09] more but
[1:09:12] you you see
[1:09:14] me because I
[1:09:17] live you live
[1:09:19] also you want some
[1:09:22] more and he
[1:09:24] says at that
[1:09:28] day ye shall
[1:09:31] know that
[1:09:34] I am in my
[1:09:37] father and
[1:09:40] ye in me and me and
[1:09:44] I you
[1:09:47] and I know these are such common
[1:09:52] scriptures that have so much
[1:09:56] power but we take them as
[1:10:00] common because imagine let's imagine
[1:10:03] what really
[1:10:06] happens and I heard a brother preaching
[1:10:09] this and it just it really caught
[1:10:13] me
[1:10:15] Joshua do you
[1:10:18] think that the people got so
[1:10:22] tired
[1:10:24] of him
[1:10:27] talking of this promised
[1:10:31] land and I know what you're
[1:10:34] thinking and I I use this one for for a
[1:10:39] reason you're saying
[1:10:41] brother you're going to preach on Joshua
[1:10:45] again we've heard you can't say anything
[1:10:48] you haven't said
[1:10:52] before don't worry that's we're going
[1:10:54] somewhere
[1:10:57] tonight so imagine
[1:10:59] now they were in the wilderness for 40
[1:11:03] years but it came to a
[1:11:06] point that they began to die
[1:11:10] off that generation began to die
[1:11:14] off and they began to hear Joshua and
[1:11:18] Caleb okay tell us the story
[1:11:22] again how you to the promised
[1:11:25] land how you brought those grapes
[1:11:30] across how that there were
[1:11:33] giants tell us the story
[1:11:35] again because it's so
[1:11:38] common just like that's what the word
[1:11:42] does we let it become common in our
[1:11:45] lives if God said he would heal
[1:11:49] you then with faith
[1:11:52] tonight you take that
[1:11:55] healing but many
[1:11:57] times we let our
[1:12:01] brother we step all over
[1:12:05] him he begin he's our stepping
[1:12:10] stone but that's not what the word
[1:12:13] said the word said he would
[1:12:16] produce a
[1:12:18] bride that would make herself
[1:12:21] ready you cannot tell
[1:12:24] me that in any
[1:12:27] time that the word of God it's not
[1:12:31] producing what it is
[1:12:36] today that's that's what I see that's
[1:12:39] the faith that I
[1:12:41] have a br a brother asked me this one
[1:12:44] the other
[1:12:45] day he said why is so
[1:12:50] great I want to understand this William
[1:12:52] brandom you guys talk
[1:12:56] about we're driving down the
[1:12:59] road and I threw a renion into
[1:13:05] him he said you I could prove that God
[1:13:09] is
[1:13:11] everywhere I said no you
[1:13:16] can't and I started hitting him with
[1:13:20] faith and I said you you have to do by
[1:13:25] faith we have to prove
[1:13:27] it by the scriptures
[1:13:31] yes but by faith God gave us that
[1:13:36] tool to believe who he
[1:13:39] was then later couple days later I told
[1:13:43] him you want to know how I believe a
[1:13:47] prophet said the scripture says
[1:13:50] that but it's by faith
[1:13:54] you know we
[1:13:55] come we say let the word do what it says
[1:13:58] it's going to
[1:14:02] do but you got to do it by
[1:14:05] faith you know there are many here
[1:14:10] today that need The Old Rugged
[1:14:17] Cross and you say what are you saying
[1:14:20] brother I need that old rck cross every
[1:14:26] I don't want forget what he did for
[1:14:29] me sacrifice that he
[1:14:32] made because that
[1:14:35] blood for me it's still wet on the
[1:14:41] cross was I there that
[1:14:44] day no but by faith I believe
[1:14:48] it now it's through
[1:14:52] faith became tangible to
[1:14:56] me but that's what God's word
[1:15:00] does but we got to take
[1:15:03] it in our lives every single
[1:15:06] day because John the Baptist his eyes
[1:15:09] met with
[1:15:13] Jesus but so did
[1:15:16] Peter's Peter said Lord if that's
[1:15:20] you call me to walk on the water
[1:15:26] his eyes met
[1:15:27] Jesus and he walked on the
[1:15:31] water but as soon as he took his
[1:15:36] eyes as soon as he took him off
[1:15:40] Jesus he began to look
[1:15:43] around he saw the waves he saw the
[1:15:47] storms he saw every problem that there
[1:15:51] was and he he almost
[1:15:57] drowned so now here here he
[1:16:02] is let's go a little
[1:16:05] further let me read you let me read your
[1:16:08] a
[1:16:10] quote Jehovah Gyra
[1:16:14] 3 paragraph
[1:16:17] n he said but one day oh hallelujah
[1:16:22] hallelujah he said remember that
[1:16:27] promise his promise to
[1:16:30] Abraham because what
[1:16:32] happens we forget about what God's done
[1:16:35] for
[1:16:37] us they wondered in the
[1:16:41] wilderness but before that they were in
[1:16:46] bondage we got comfortable in
[1:16:49] bondage we get comfortable in
[1:16:52] bondage
[1:16:54] we take it we accept what the devil has
[1:16:57] for
[1:16:59] us we take it we let sin bondage
[1:17:04] us but he said one
[1:17:07] day God
[1:17:10] remembered that he gave Abraham a
[1:17:13] promise he said Glory now I'm beginning
[1:17:16] to fill
[1:17:19] religion notice God remembered his
[1:17:21] promise to Abraham
[1:17:24] he anointed a
[1:17:27] prophet with a pillar of fire over
[1:17:30] him he came down into the
[1:17:33] land and began to remind
[1:17:37] them of the promise of
[1:17:40] God that could not
[1:17:43] fail and God was present to vindicate
[1:17:47] that
[1:17:49] word he said right he told them there
[1:17:53] there was a
[1:17:54] land flowing with milk and
[1:17:58] honey God had given it to
[1:18:01] them they marched out of
[1:18:04] Egypt on the on the on the strength of a
[1:18:10] testimony of this Prophet with the
[1:18:12] pillar of fire over
[1:18:15] him because he was
[1:18:19] sent and God had
[1:18:21] proved that he was with
[1:18:24] him isn't that what happened in our
[1:18:27] midst
[1:18:29] church has God through his
[1:18:32] word Pro it to
[1:18:35] us that he's a
[1:18:37] powerful he's a mighty
[1:18:40] God because what did he do he said after
[1:18:44] those
[1:18:45] times he said now I will send my
[1:18:49] son and I will put him on the cross
[1:18:53] I will shed his
[1:18:56] blood that's what he did for
[1:18:59] us but many times we take it as
[1:19:03] common oh what are you going to
[1:19:05] do tell me what God did on the cross
[1:19:10] again I'm not going to tell you what
[1:19:12] he's done on the
[1:19:14] cross I'm going to tell you what he's
[1:19:16] done with
[1:19:18] me I'm going to tell you how he
[1:19:20] transformed
[1:19:21] me
[1:19:23] how he's made me a Son of
[1:19:25] God because that's what John
[1:19:28] saw he said this is
[1:19:31] what this is what I
[1:19:34] saw something inside of
[1:19:37] John it was
[1:19:39] bubbling his
[1:19:41] prophecy had come to pass the prophecy
[1:19:45] of
[1:19:47] Isaiah
[1:19:49] Jeremiah had come to pass now his
[1:19:52] brother brother Bram and
[1:19:55] today after 2,000
[1:19:58] years we still have that
[1:20:01] evidence that we have passed from Death
[1:20:06] life our
[1:20:08] Joshua has brought back the
[1:20:12] evidence and we on our
[1:20:15] way to that Promised
[1:20:17] Land tasting of the Heavenly gifts of
[1:20:21] God that he has brought back to
[1:20:25] us notice it how
[1:20:29] wonderful where when we were once in
[1:20:34] darkness he said now look where we're at
[1:20:37] today now we're going to get to our
[1:20:40] message
[1:20:42] here because many times we find oursel
[1:20:44] in a
[1:20:46] place that we are
[1:20:51] undone we are broken
[1:20:54] we let the devil tell us whatever he
[1:20:56] wants We
[1:21:00] Believe oh let's change
[1:21:04] today accept that cross that blood that
[1:21:08] he shed for
[1:21:10] us because let's read the
[1:21:13] scripture acts
[1:21:16] three and I and I want you like I said
[1:21:19] we're not in hurry we got an
[1:21:21] hour
[1:21:25] now in my
[1:21:27] time my time is
[1:21:30] faster let's let's start off with verse
[1:21:34] two remember how the rice had
[1:21:39] met and a certain man lay from his
[1:21:43] mother's womb was
[1:21:50] carried whom they laid daily at the Gate
[1:21:53] of the temple which is called
[1:21:59] Beautiful to ask arms of them that
[1:22:02] entered into the
[1:22:06] temple who seen Peter and John about to
[1:22:09] go into the temple ask an
[1:22:19] arms
[1:22:21] imag and John walking down the
[1:22:28] gates imagine what that lay man was
[1:22:33] thinking he was lame from his from
[1:22:37] birth they would bring him every day to
[1:22:40] the
[1:22:42] gate why do you how do you think he
[1:22:46] felt do you think he felt great about
[1:22:51] himself that they had to bring him to
[1:22:53] beg every single
[1:22:57] day now we're going to switch it around
[1:23:00] here Peter and John walked with
[1:23:05] Jesus they saw how he healed the
[1:23:09] sick now the scene is
[1:23:13] changed and
[1:23:15] Peter fasting his
[1:23:19] eyes upon him with
[1:23:21] John
[1:23:23] and he said look on us
[1:23:26] re he said look on
[1:23:29] us and we know what the prophet of God
[1:23:33] says he said they weren't saying look at
[1:23:37] me he he said they they try to say pay
[1:23:43] attention we're about to tell you
[1:23:47] something verse six vers six and pet
[1:23:50] Peter's famous words
[1:23:53] Silver and
[1:23:54] Gold Have I
[1:23:59] None but s such I have
[1:24:04] G such I have give I
[1:24:08] Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of
[1:24:13] Nazareth he says rise up and
[1:24:17] walk that was good enough right
[1:24:21] there and it says Peter
[1:24:24] then he said he took him by the right
[1:24:28] hand and lifted him
[1:24:31] up and
[1:24:34] immediately his feet his
[1:24:37] ankles they reive
[1:24:42] strength just another story
[1:24:46] huh I know many times God's word doesn't
[1:24:49] excite
[1:24:51] us
[1:24:53] we've heard this we've heard this a
[1:24:54] million
[1:24:56] times and leaping up he stood and walked
[1:24:59] and entered into the
[1:25:03] temple walking and
[1:25:05] leaping and praising
[1:25:09] God but why was he so
[1:25:12] happy church that was the first
[1:25:16] time the first time that he entered into
[1:25:20] the temple
[1:25:23] he was brought outside of the
[1:25:25] temple without
[1:25:27] hope he never had that
[1:25:31] opportunity to step into that
[1:25:34] Temple but that's what God's word does
[1:25:37] for
[1:25:38] us he sent the fful
[1:25:42] ministry to give us
[1:25:44] hope that's what he did
[1:25:47] church this man didn't have no
[1:25:50] hope but Peter fastened his eyes on
[1:25:56] him he says Silver and Gold
[1:25:59] Have he says but what I do
[1:26:02] have he says I give unto you no
[1:26:06] hope he didn't know
[1:26:08] much he didn't know what it was to go
[1:26:11] into God's
[1:26:13] Temple he didn't know what it was to
[1:26:15] praise the
[1:26:16] Lord but it was at the third
[1:26:20] hour the Third
[1:26:22] hour that they were passing
[1:26:25] by because it was that
[1:26:28] hour that they went into the
[1:26:31] temple and they gave their
[1:26:34] prayers but it was also the third
[1:26:37] hour that Grace came to
[1:26:40] him and it was also that third
[1:26:43] hour that Christ died on the
[1:26:46] cross they went and he shed his blood it
[1:26:51] was that was the only only
[1:26:53] hope that that lame man
[1:26:56] had was at the third
[1:26:59] hour and many times we may say oh
[1:27:03] brother that's just a another common
[1:27:06] story here's the prophet of God he said
[1:27:09] I could take hours and
[1:27:11] hours telling you of things that I've
[1:27:16] seen oh why he said Jesus her great
[1:27:21] warrior he said went over and conquered
[1:27:24] that
[1:27:25] land he conquered death and
[1:27:28] hell he conquered
[1:27:31] grave on that third
[1:27:35] day you see how the trees are coming
[1:27:37] into
[1:27:40] place and he said I am he that was
[1:27:43] dead but I'm alive
[1:27:47] forever I have the keys to death and
[1:27:50] hell he said there's the
[1:27:53] Conqueror since he rent the veil in
[1:27:57] two he said here he
[1:28:00] stands so now or there he
[1:28:03] stands now here here it is
[1:28:07] today we hear many
[1:28:10] times and we we don't we don't
[1:28:13] think you
[1:28:16] know what it how it
[1:28:19] affects the presence of God
[1:28:23] oh here's brother Caleb
[1:28:25] again talking about this revival in
[1:28:28] Africa talking about this revival in
[1:28:33] Africa there's brother Caleb
[1:28:36] again telling us of all the Miracles
[1:28:38] that happened in his dad's
[1:28:42] time here's brother Tommy
[1:28:45] again here's this one and we don't
[1:28:49] realize that's why we cannot have the
[1:28:53] healing in our
[1:28:57] midst don't take it for
[1:29:00] comment the same thing happened to the
[1:29:02] prophet of
[1:29:04] God the prophet after he had after he
[1:29:08] had called the Scrolls into
[1:29:13] existence he's there there with a bunch
[1:29:15] of
[1:29:17] brothers and they're getting together in
[1:29:19] a
[1:29:20] home and they were about to pray to
[1:29:26] leave and brother Bram says here let let
[1:29:28] me talk to you about
[1:29:31] something and the and the prop the
[1:29:34] prophet God was about to start
[1:29:38] talking and one of the brothers
[1:29:40] says what brother
[1:29:43] Bram what are you going to tell us
[1:29:46] again how you call the Scrolls into
[1:29:50] existence you know many wow it happened
[1:29:53] with our
[1:29:54] prophet of course it's going to happen
[1:29:56] in our
[1:29:58] midst same
[1:30:01] spirits and I know I preached on a
[1:30:03] blushing Prophet not that long
[1:30:07] ago but I want you to
[1:30:10] imagine that Prophet gave his life for
[1:30:14] us imagine how it made him
[1:30:17] feel I could imagine him leaving with
[1:30:20] his head down
[1:30:24] how great God
[1:30:26] was that this nation a filthy
[1:30:31] Nation but that was the tool that God
[1:30:34] used and they said what is it just
[1:30:37] another story brother
[1:30:40] BR how the Scrolls came into
[1:30:44] existence out of nothing they were
[1:30:47] created our brother Brown probably had
[1:30:49] his head down
[1:30:52] but it was a couple of days later
[1:30:55] church that he walked
[1:30:58] into the house of had
[1:31:01] right and the brothers that were with
[1:31:04] him they said we've never felt the
[1:31:07] presence of
[1:31:09] God because the word came
[1:31:12] out and Har R stood up and
[1:31:15] said brother
[1:31:17] Bram that's every bit of the
[1:31:20] truth brother bra says you ask what you
[1:31:25] want
[1:31:27] anything you're
[1:31:28] poor your sister's
[1:31:31] crippled it doesn't matter what you
[1:31:34] want and she said oh I only
[1:31:37] want the salvation of my two
[1:31:41] kids chch I'm
[1:31:45] tired of letting the devil take what's
[1:31:49] ours we're tired of it
[1:31:53] it's time to claim what's
[1:31:55] ours it's a claiming
[1:31:58] time don't don't take God's word as
[1:32:02] common you call God's word into
[1:32:06] existence you know we we said many
[1:32:09] times our founding Pastor was years and
[1:32:12] years ahead of his
[1:32:16] time I'm sorry to tell you you may not
[1:32:18] want to hear
[1:32:20] this
[1:32:22] I think we finally caught up to
[1:32:25] her the word that he

[1:32:45] up if you could only realize the level
[1:32:48] that we are
[1:32:50] at
[1:32:53] we're at a level right
[1:32:55] now that we have never been
[1:32:58] before remember the prophet of God says
[1:33:01] this
[1:33:02] statement he said everything that Adam
