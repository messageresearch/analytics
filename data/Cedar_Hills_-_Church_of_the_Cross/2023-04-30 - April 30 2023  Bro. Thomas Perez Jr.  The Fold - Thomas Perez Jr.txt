very happy to have you here from Brother Allen's church we love them very much I love the Martins very much are our great friends amigos happy to see each and everyone those that are on internet God bless you yes that we'll we'll hear at a later date God bless you and we sure had ourselves a time in the Lord on on Friday night we had an all-night prayer meeting and we were very happy to be part of it I'm happy to you you have heard of it before uh and now we have experience from nine o'clock till six o'clock in the morning and we're grateful to the Lord for for all his many blessings we want to turn immediately to the book of Saint Luke the second chapter and uh and I want to to entitle this message the foldables empowerment uh the fold a lot of bliss uh it is simply something of such of nature is this if you would get this handkerchief and you would put it like this my wife did such a good job of washing it and ironing it for me but if you get this it's a piece of cloth yes this is the fold is and you keep on folding and that's why the Bible talks about a five-fold [Music] and it talks about the seven-fold glory and Seth that was a wonderful song every every Revival needs it needs a song we pray that that'll just be the first one of many um I saw Levi back there God bless you yeah amen good to see you in the house of the Lord and it came to pass from chapter 2 and verse 1 of The Book of Luke Luke and came to pass in those days that there were went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed yes let us approach the author and ask him to give us our daily potions Lord Jesus we're grateful to be in your house today and happy to see each and every one of of the your people that you have purchased with your own blood we asked father that when this is all over we'll be sure to give you all the honor and all the glories happy to be alive and happy to be here in your house we ask that you bless us in Jesus name amen amen amen and verse 2 verse and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of Syria Syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City even though and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth unto Judea unto a city the the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of Davido to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and it was that uh it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room in the Inn and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger is and this scripture is the majority of time we use it for Christmas time I want to entitle it again the folders this is again what a fold is it's a piece of cloth and when you do this number this is the fold and so is I want to find out this morning what is it exactly inside of the fold the question we we have folded it it's nice and pressed we put it in our pocket to be used now where you you'll find out and I I appreciate the word of God that's been coming from this sacred deaths last Sunday's message was my goodness gracious out of this world we will give the Lord Jesus Jesus now once again this is the fold what is in the folds when we understand this immediately it takes this to Saint John the 20th chapter and we appreciate the word of God Saint John when see a chapter you might not find a a a relationship with Luke Chapter 2. but some of the uh of the of the studied people and if you find the translation in Spanish you find out that the the the swaddling clothes that's used in chapter two of the book of uh of of Saint Luke is the same word that is used in Saint John the 20th chapter in San Juan capital of one is the birth one is for the burials now this is called the fold and the first day of the week chapter 20 of the book of Saint John day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the Sepulcher and seeth the stone taken away from the Sepulcher man then she then she runeth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other the disciple unto them they have taken away the Lord out of the Sepulcher and we know not where they have laid him foreign Peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the Sepulcher is and so they rambled together and the other disciple did outrun Peter and came forth to the sepulch down and he's stooping down verse 5. and solve the linen clothes lying yet when he not intro and then cometh Simon Peter following him and went into the Sepulcher and seeth the linen closed lie and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrath together in a place by itself when Joseph cuando Jose and and they he he asked for the body of Jesus and he desired that body and he put him in his own tomb and when they laid him there they put the Bible says a napkin over his face there is the napkin but I want you to notice that the napkin was not with the other burial clothes there there is a place where where the the scholar says it was folded neatly in a place by itself this takes it from Israeli or Hebrew traditions this is the way the master knew or or the servant knew that the master was done when the master was eating his food and he would get his napkin and he would put it like that it meant that he was done eating but when he was not done yet and he folded up his napkin and he put it right by his food it meant this is not done yet back very soon pronto so Jesus Jesus he understanding this that in the office of the son could only be limited to a certain degree the prophet of God says while he was here in the office of the sun about the Sevenfold glory of God he knew nothing about what was in the Fallen but when he end but when he goes up and he says all power is given to me in heaven and in Earth before he goes up he folds the napkin that was over his face to signify this I will be back very soon that's why he says in his words get a little while foreign take Claire why would he take care of Revelation the Revelation that was to be unfolded in the Book of Revelation of the apocalypses now the Revel revelation of Jesus Christ not so much brother Branham says show the deity of his personality what he would be doing in his work in his body in other words is this he knew nothing about what was in the folded it went up into heaven received all powers the fold has got to be unfolded all right that's what Revelation means isolation means this is the revelation of Jesus Christ things that are in the fall because people don't believe in a five-fold much this is what brother Branham says when he asked Jack Moore this question he says Revelation chapter one who is this he says it is Jesus Christ in glorified conditions and he says it does not gel it is it's not in the foldable bless because it is Jesus Christ in glorified conditions to find out and you've got to unveil and you've got to unfold what is this now Ezekiel Tu is the Book of Ezekiel chapter 2. capital of us tells us this this is I believe a tremendous scripture why is it that people don't want the five-fold ministry ministerio Jesus did Jesus he found it important to fold the napkin is in in Ezekiel and verse 9 it simply says this is a great this is a great a Great Book and when I looked behold in hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein um to me I find out that there are five it's a five-fold it's five offices why is it that the messenger or the message of the hours and those that claim the message of the hours will tell us that there are three offices of one God the other five offices of the five-fold as Jesus thought it was important Jesus that he had to fold it meaning I'll be back very soon now now when you see a star a rock understood you know we about 10 years ago we were able to go to to Alaska I took my wife on a cruise what a great time we have to be Muslim Grand Temple but I remember what the the the man was telling us he says you see the glacier is you you see the glacier Los glacieres that is snow that fell 150 years ago so when you see a star is looking at a star out there is now this is what I believe people have have thought about the message of the hours people say is history is and I say this you're the worst it all depends which point of the trajectory you are towards that started when you see that light of that storm it seems like that is already history to you and the word of God can remain history to you unless you're able I'm asking to ride the light to ride the light back to the origin when the light was sent off that's why people will just say I press play and I press play too Bliss man now order look at the stars you know you climb the pyramid and when you climb the pyramid you're gonna see the star this is what happens to the majority of people they come to the message they say who God sentios and there was no mightier Prophet than our prophets that was Elijah the prophet Elias is what a man that we have received in our time but we can say that is history or we can ride the light those were the origins of the light has come to us now it all depends so depending on where you live that's the reason he folded his napkin back very soon here I will be okay yesterday it won't be just one Jesus in the day of Pentecost there's the devil was so confused he looked at one man called Jesus Jesus and he said I got him finished the fall started to unfold started to unfold pronto what was he going to do it brings me back again it got real sick and I say this in time and time again until we really get it for ourselves they asked our pastor Pastor what will you do now that your papa uh he he's got really sick and his answer I'll never forget this it says what was the Holy Ghost given foreign you can go to Pentecostal church and you can feel good the music can come we can all dance but that's only in the flesh that has nothing to do within the folds That's Just In the Flesh because right now we don't live in the dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit of last and when I looked entrances where what are you gonna do now that your papa got sick what was the Holy Ghost given foreign man you're not gonna get me this morning tell your neighbor was to continue in seven churches I don't just listen to brother Branham on Sunday mother Brown every single day before I come here I listen to Brothers I press play the message that is written in between the lines [Music] that's the drama this is the drama that's where Christ is revealed in his own words Christ the Mysteries please tell me God reveals now what am I what what do I say you got you got you got to do something about it you started contest we young ministers and I'm going to say this Ministries we got to do something I see brother Favio back there I saw my Papa this morning these are men to be wondered they're they're they're they're they're an endangered species there are men that have given their whole lives these are men not men just of just any type of these are men that have come out of the folds I'll be back very soon if you don't find what God Said in the word the fading in your life foreign aura in the book of haggai chapter one he said thus speak at verse 2 the Lord of hosts saying this people say is the time is not come and we can sit up stand up here and tell you it is seedless that the Holy Ghost is yours and every promise is yours but then you're here the Lord of hosts saying he doesn't say my people he said this people is the time has not come and we sit down in our Pew what are you waiting foreign you know you know and up until the day that my papa got sick he was doing something for the Lord and you know being where he's at somebody's sick he walks by them he says the Lord's going to heal you and that person gets healed it is [Music] I'm in Africa and we're having a prayer line we're not putting our hands on the people and as we're putting as we are in the prayer line I feel my dad's hand right on my shoulders because even when he's sick the fold isn't it [Applause] the old has the power to create worlds foreign [Music] now the time has not come we have an actor because the time is income I will tell you when the time has come yeah and it's not right now I'm just gonna stay home and I'll wait for the time to come and when the time comes because Gabriel will blow a trumpet and then I'll know the time has not come verse three that's what this then came the word of of hagai the Prophet saying I'm going to repeat it I'm going to say it right then came the word of the Lord by haggai the prophet saying is it time for you I really don't care what they say about us I don't care what denomination has to say I really don't care what people say if they say there's no five-fold or nothing I will say this is because who was he going to empty into yes again after this if there's no fivefold you know I came to play there's no seven pole Glory glorious then came the word the word of the Lord by hagai the prophets is it time for you we've come to the house of the Lord my name is we're professional Christians professionals not inside of our hearts we're looking for something and brother Brandon says if you want something to happen right glory is it time for you [Applause] every generation has got to to answer that is what would make my papa and brother Fabio and brother Caleb travel the way they do yes what would make my uncle Abraham study the way he did yes just so he could be a scholar so he could be a learned man it is [Applause] I guess I I I'll go to church and raise up my hands don't do me no favors don't do that to nobody do that for yourself when you come to the house of the Lord raise up your hands because it's my time because who do you think you are nobody but I am a sinner but in the foreign and why people say there is no life in the message let me tell you Uganda differs differs with that opinion get first with that opinion America is different differs from that opinion amen they differ from that opinion because they know time for you now if you were the Price Is Right I know how people get with I think it was Bob Barker Barker and he would say now you're going to have to put the time and the money what it is and whoever comes closest got a shot at a lot of money and they would announce the name come on down hahaha and it was just a great show and people would ride and they would love it Hallelujah acting crazier than crazy because they had a chance in this role and they said Royal you don't have a question you are blessed beyond all measures you've been Justified you were elected of God before the family amen so if the word would tell you this is now the seal does not say the name it is but you by faith when you somebody says is it time for you talking about me come on down [Applause] we've been so privileged by God in this church I would never say that we are the best in the world but I'll tell you one thing we have been so blessed by God to have a founding Pastor you have a pastor the way we do friends the way we did a Ministry and my question to you this is [Music] what's it time for you to do what is wander around nobody loves me and you know what if God really loved me give me a steak um now I've got so much business well you asked him for it and you asked him Lord I love you and he's giving you power to become a son of God foreign and when the world gives you a little [Music] um over there where I live and you get all happy yeah but you see you hear the song leader says Oh How I Love Jesus Jesus raise up your hands until you find out you open up one of the sales that's what Elijah brother Branham says he was all by himself he opened up one of them they found his name that's why we don't ask for no forgiveness you can't preacher man didn't give me my gift man Jesus Jesus folded his napkins I'll be back real soon don't blame me you if you have somebody to blame he was just looking ahead in time that belongs to each and everywhere play play the tape play the tape can you play it this is something I like you to see our pastor sent me this yesterday now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts all right here he goes I have all my faith the young man can do nothing without the old but he has to be proven it has to be cut from the same cloth that's why God sent the prophet I love you to the Widow material he was a prophet who was of the same materials we can't be different somebody told me here since 1970. it's not possible Don't Tell Me Jesus is my brother [Music] he's my brother you'll find out he has to be your brother and surrender all we love you the prophet of God says this is it's like firing a rocket there is when you fired and he fired William Branham into the air did he stay by himself Believers you heard our Pastor said no sir did he stay by himself this is the way the rocket went and when it ran up it exploded that one that went up the prophet of God says from that one yeah five more came out salieron ahead I didn't say that you know it's what was in the phone didn't say that you know when that rocket exploded five more stars came out of them [Applause] and the first one to come out was an apostle foreign [Applause] but did it stop there he said from which one of those five more came out and five more cameras that was what was written in the fall is so what do you do now what is written in the fold look is now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have so much and bring in little it does but he have not enough but you are not filled with drinks he clothed but there is Wages earn its wages but it's put in a bag with holes and we heard greatest message I've ever heard last Sunday and we put it in the bag and
