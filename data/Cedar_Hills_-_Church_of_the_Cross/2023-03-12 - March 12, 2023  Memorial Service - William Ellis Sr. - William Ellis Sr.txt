before us we have more tools we look for immortality immortalidad and what feeds us to want to get to mortality it's the word of God is because when we hear the word of God there's a voice that tells us you are not from here no it is you are a pilgrim it is and we're so glad that we have that hope this evening on behalf of myself and the church we wish to give our condolences to the eldest family they've always been a special family to us and it's an honor to be here this I might add that today my father passed away 12 years ago and it's fitting to me to be here to send another brother home on this day yes they both were 69 when they passed away but they're in their 20s right now doesn't that make you jealous don't you wish to be young again when you look in the mirror brother Caleb and you ask yourself what happened to you is I tell my wife when I got married I was I was in good shape I was young amen energetic now I got air there's a young Mark waiting for me ayune Mark Hoven chemist and we want to get there in the book of second Tiffany chapter 2 and verse 21 seconds I'm just going to read this verse because I want you to go home and read from 1 through 20. because 1 through 20 hinges on verse 21. and we're talking about a vessel tonight if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meet for the Master's use and prepare it unto every good work is Father father your word is blessed and now we have been blessed in here Lord as we speak a few words this evening may you have the preeminence that all that we live for that all we go through in life it is for you Lord yes we shall be again with you in homes in life but we know one thing that you are faithful to and for those that have felt The Emptiness father step in and fill it with your Holy Spirit precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated if for a few minutes I could speak about uh brother Alice in the good way of course there's so much that can be said about one another is go through life we learn things about each other but I had the privilege of being part of brother Billy's life if I can say that when I first started working for the Department of Transportation Department I had the privilege of working with a message believer and that message believer was brother Billy Ellis I remember my first day at work it was December the 28th 1987 at seven o'clock in the morning I had to report to Lordsburg Lordsburg it was one of those town that you passed by you never stopped but I had to work there I remember getting to work early that first day on a Monday I was excited to be working I was getting 525 an hour that was good money back then minimum wage was 375.75 but what was special about that day Especial when I got there I was greeted by Brother Alice and we used to call him tiny I don't know why but as I got to work the first thing he says medical sticks welcome bienvenido I felt at home being there working with brother Billy misses I had the privilege of going to the same church he did at that time I had the privilege of working with him I had the privilege of having a mother-in-law who was sister to his mother-in-law okay I had the privilege of sharing my lunch with him without ever having to offer him my lunch because when I wasn't looking brother Billy would go to My Lunchbox you would take my burritos and my sweet dessert and then you would complain to me it's a sticks this is sticks you need to pack more lunch and I will always respond by saying tiny tiny I'm gonna need your social security number Social so I can claim you on my dependence because you're killing me and I'm going home hungry and we would both laugh about it but we have that confidence whenever I will see his lunchbox I wasn't afraid to open it because I could go in there and I could take what I wanted unfortunately for me it was already empty yes which is why he would go to my lunchboxo I also had the privilege of playing the drums when you played the basso and when he's saying he was a statue of a man he was a big man with a humble heart which I never understood why they called them tiny but when he sang and he played by inspiration you could feel the presence of the Lord come down and it would move through the audience and that told me that here was a child of God so even though he had been born a broken vessel when he sang to the Lord he could feel his presence and he knew he had been redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Jesus every one of us when we were born nobody's blood was worthy except the blood of Jesus Christ Jesus and I would see him when he would be there in church playing the base and sometimes Midway to the song he would just stop singing yes and just bow his head and start crying like a baby it wasn't that it wasn't a man noise but this broken vessel realized that he was in the presence Jesus and he realized he couldn't put his pieces back together but the master but Maestro had taken the pieces and he had placed him together with such love brother Branham says in the message Hebrews what a beautiful picture of Christo who had heard from Heaven that we were lost and he came down to earth to pursue the enemy all the way to hell and captured the lost souls and he brought us back and restored to us everything that we had yet before the we that were born to be Sons and Daughters of God but I said I came across a poem entitled I was a broken vessel it says once I was shattered and the pieces were scattered on the ground I was empty estaba and nothing but a shell is then a Potter found me in control and he picked up the pieces one by one he put them back together he handled every piece with love until I was whole again I was perfect though I was a simple jar I was perfect and empty perfect ready to be filled with the spirit of God when brother Billy would sing that song The Masterpiece that last part of the verse that says I was the vessel that was made of clay my life was broken to Pieces by the storms of the day it laid with no Beauty on the desert plain in El desierto then one day around evening time Almighty Angel was walking through the sands of time and he picked up the broken pieces with tears in his eyes he cried in his heart I will restore your restaurant this broke the Bible says in second Corinthians chapter 4 but we have this treasure in Earthly vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despairados persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the light also of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies Jesus amen what a privilege it was to be able to walk with the Son of God in this hour yeah and even though he may have died a sick man is not sick anymore you know he he used to he used to tell his children we're going to go to brother Castillo's house Hermano Associates because he loved to have Fellowship he loved to be around people that he loved like and one time we had a brother that showed up from Arizona unexpectedly and my brother Bill looked at my dad and he said they come to make the to pollute the the talk because he didn't want nobody to interfere with his Fellowship he used to sing a song one of the verses would go I used to be a junkie a junkie and my my dad said brother Billy did I hear you right that you used to be a donkey erasum no he said a junkie no no I'm sorry and then from that time we would ask him brother Billy can you sing that song again used to be a donkey he has such a beautiful voice when you would play and sing to the Lord and we had the privilege of having to hear him sing the Lord and God blessed Alice family there's going to be days that you're going to feel emptiness is because we're humanos and we're going to feel the loss of our loved ones but I'm so glad that Jesus is still on the scene Jesus and he's there to fill the emptiness amen God bless you foreign Church full of people here I can see that he was well loved from everybody I can truthfully say that he was my friend because we use a word friend real loosely many times because somebody did you a favor or because you work with him and you say hi and goodbye when you're through working but our friend is more than that the Bible says a friend is somebody that will give his life for you and Billy what when they put him in and they called me and Jimmy to go pray he wanted for us to go pray for him I entered the hospital and grabbed his hand and his Tears start coming out of his eyes we used to be real close me his family and my family and when my wife was alive we used to visit each other and I want to say it tonight so let it be on record and Records brother Billy and sister Alicia we're the perfect host and Hostess you could not visit them unless just Richard said you wait I'm gonna make something to eat so this you see Mark that's why he was foreign I mean we were real close because all these was when our children were young and as the children start growing and they start going to school and high school and then sickness hits the people we didn't get to see each other like we used to when we our children were small uh so when I went to the house hospital he is because when you have a friend Amigo it's not a temporary friendship it's a friendship until when you get married on to death we were foreign [Music] he said those were the best pork chops well you know we had we could stay here all night and all week talking about the explodes and the things that we did foreign me and Caleb got Prof people on top of it is and and he had one that was like a jumbo ATV with a big why nobody TVs you you were with me and you too Jr anyway he said he put they are to put out Freedom back up his truck and he being this big briefly anyway I felt so good because I had never been on top one is oh we would go through all the roads there you know they showed us a place where [Music] muy bien anyway I one one evening I hadn't seen anything so here I go on the ATV and there's Mountain Roads you know you go through those dirt roads all over the hills and weigh in the distance here there was a a plane and then a bunch of big oak trees and I thought I was a professional ATV driver yep I said I'm gonna go and Scout that area because there was like a ridge coming this way and another Ridge going this way any form what you call a like a cul-de-sac Bridge but as I was going all of a sudden there was like a little gorge in a Royal yeah from his father his father would dare you to do something yeah you know I said his parents like me he you're afraid to go down there these things got a lot of power with tiny can like private Billy I can drive it too yeah I don't know [Music] Los Angeles did you see anything uh I hit the mother Road Grandes well to make a long story short but I said we were the right campus and uh I said if you guys want to kill something and full obedience entitled them to kill the bugs I told Mark and you other guys follow me so I was leading them on the ATV in Las Vegas of course Jr couldn't follow us because I I had his your father say TV you know anyway when we got to that cul-deck there was a buck running real fast a nice is I gave that back a haircut and you would know who was the lucky one he was down by the road on his truck and their back print right to your dinner yes thanks because uh gracias I still have the picture you know the photo you're gonna know how close I gave him a haircut just talked to Jr to kill yourself we killed almost everybody killed casitos so I mean he uh he was such a good friend and like I say I could give many things that you know that we did when we were together but I want to say about three days before he passed away Tres Diaz uh I went to the rehab where he was you know for he was you had to enter into the rehab and go all the way down it was about between five and six o'clock I guess yeah and uh interestingly he says and he was by himself in the room I entered into the room in real cuarto and I saw him the condition that he was in the Mirena conditions and the tears coming out from his eyes and and he just got real tight from my hand and I said uh it's so good to see you Billy this movie went away and you could see that he was in a lot of pain to the Lord and his struggle just to for words to come out from his mouth and I said this is not the feeling that I knew yesterday a lot of compassion that I had for him and he looked at me and I looked at him I said Billy idiot Billy you had a Ministry when you were well but we know that your body does not belong to you your body belongs to satanic and you say how can you say that is he he does not have a title did to to your song brother Brian says that when God is through with you Satan can do anything with your body let me give you an example my mother my mother he does a good judge begins at home my mother never said a bad word in her life stupid or dumb nothing is uh dementia you words that you would never and you know you know would come out of the mouth of my mother is my mother no no God was through especially his family one Easter Sunday he went to the grave of his wife and Billy Paul was just a small kid and they went to the grave of his first wife Esposa and Billy Paul says is that my mother in there is no your mother is not down there but the part foreign you say well is she down there the body is your soul is not there just of the house the Tabernacles that house the souls you see Ruben so when I saw Billy there because I said that is not him we can't know us he was such a jolly fellow content he was always had a Smiles all the time that I knew him love would come out out of him so we can he could say because then he was handicapped for a long time I have fought a good fight I have finished

friends and family and loved ones have come to pay their respects to we know as our brother Billy Alvis we want to give our condolences The church here Cedar Hills Church of the Cross all the members here either the family family may God bless you may he comfort you and as he said he would never leave us we are appreciative to that to the Lord for that amen before we sit down if we can just read in the book of Saint John the 14th chapter and I'm going to read just in English to save some time it reads like this let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe it also in me In My Father's House are many mansions it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go ye no and the way you know Obama said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated as the brothers said we can stay here for a long long time talking about the life and the the times that we were able to share with brother Billy yes it was very many it's like the more that you think about it the more pages you turn back the more you remember things the more you you you see how connected uh we are with people you know I I as I was meditating I was thinking about so many different things I remember the day that I got married and my wife we we were we were blessed to have brother Billy sing in our wedding song Here we are and uh course it was a blessing to us and we still have it just to hear as we have heard many times he was his gift he sure blessed us you know brother Bill he would always call me on my birthday and the first time that he called me for you that maybe don't know maybe but but my birthday is uh December 7. anyone that knows anything about history you know what happened on December it's the day of Pearl Harbor Pearl Harbor the first time that he called and he says uh brother Caleb I want to wish you Happy Birthday this day will live in infamy and I guess he didn't realize what he had said I laughed it off with him he called me the next day and he was so worried I'm so sorry I thought infamy was a good word famous but I found out that it was famous for bad things I need to call me after that we'd always have a good laugh I remember one day he was we were able to take him on on a trip to Mexico City had never been on an airplane and he was so scared so we got him set in settled in the plane and all the guys around of course they were they were giving him a hard time oh brother Bill I've never heard the plane sound like this and then we'd hit a bump and he would hold on tight he said he would say brother Bill no this has never happened before Oh and you could just see him just sweating finally got there and he felt like he had accomplished something and so we were in church and the way this church was there was brother Paco's church and you have the church on the on the first floor and then you have the fellowship hall where we were eating companies some of the brothers had a I remember and and they were trying to convince him brother Bill we can carry you all the way up to the to the bottom of the staircases he took one look at that we all got the same visual at the same time not one of you were to slip up because we all come all the way down so many times so many stories so many things that we can say it always get a kick and we would go over and have some good old tacos tacos I always would get a kick out of my father and he said you would never believe what your father did the other day we started getting full you know what he told me he said brother Billy hermano Billy missed [Music] I'm beginning to get mad I'm getting full yeah he said it's so good I I don't want to get we always had a wonderful time when we were with him and we're thankful to God for the time that he gave us with him and as we just for a few moments we could keep on talking about different things that we had we had gone through or that we we shared with him I realized that it is a memorial service memorial service there's a purpose behind it all I am the purpose behind a memorial service is simply to preserve the remembrance of someone or something Memorial I think we've all come for that purpose observe the remembrances that we have that each one of us has a brother Bill Memorial as Jesus is speaking here in John chapter one chapter 14. there's a mystery here that Jesus is unfolding to them a mystery that he is shaking their conscience when we stayed up their subconscious he's reminding them when he says let not your heart be troubled and I want to repeat that today and I tell everyone that is here let not your hearts be troubled for in my father's house there are many men if it were not so I would have told you that he said I go to prepare a place for you and I believe every one of us has got to put our name there he said I know to prepare a place for brother Billy I mean he can put your name there this evening to prepare a place for brother Caleb let go and prepare a place for you I will come again it's a certainty Church that he would come again receive you unto himself here he is he's shaking the very conscience making the subconscious of these disciples that are here and he's trying to get them to remember something just for a few moments I won't take a lot of time trying to get them to remember not only where he had come from but he's trying to get them to remember where they had come Thomas doesn't catch it at first but Jesus makes it plain to him and he says I am the way the truth and the life found out there that the way the truth and the life and that person was who was standing in front of Thomas yes he's reminding them of something that they no longer or they are not conscious of and I believe it's the same thing tonight there are many people in this world that are not conscious of a lot of things in other words Jesus is having a memorial service with them they say brother how can you have a memorial service and I say why do you have to die to have a memorial he's having this memorial service I'm going to say it again something that had been darkened from before the foundation of the world you see when we're born into this world there are former things that we do not remember the real you and the real me and Thomas trying to understand what Jesus is saying but the problem is that he's trying to use his carnal Minds that can only go back as far as him being a toddler but Jesus is wanting to take them farther before the foundation of the world was ever laid out fundado why do we believe this message why is it that we believe the scriptures are true because this message is the only message that will help you remember who you were from the beginning I want to know how many of you have had a memorial service where it has been brought back to your memories exactly who you are where you came and where you're going yeah if you haven't if you don't know those things you can preserve the memories I believe that he believed with all his heart the message of this hour named William Miriam I'm going to say it again even when many people are walking away I believe it that much more hello everybody why okay because it helped me remember come on church I'm going to say it again because it helped me remember I was in the beginning and there has never been another message out there there are messages to make you religious there are messages that'll make you a good church but honestly the message that was brought to us by William Mary and friends that will take you back to the beginning tell you who you are in the message questions and answers on Genesis he takes us back hello everybody and this is what he says he has to look at this when God created I'd like for every one of you to put your name there today when God created brother Billy Billy or how about when God created brother Caleb he said I was before the foundation of the world show me a religion that can take you that far back [Music] my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know I was there better Joyce come on now anybody was there who else I thought maybe I was talking to some Believers here he said I was there you can say I was there oh I don't believe you're getting it brother Randomness but now just a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began now there was some part of me the rest of you all here that is in Christ Jesus before the world ever began and here's to my analysis of that I think that the people today that are possessed with this Spirit the spirit a part of these Angelic beings which rotated off of God [Music] hello everybody I'm going to say it again we have become too Carnales and we don't remember the greatest thing we can achieve in this life is to find the person of the Lord Jesus only in him is eternal life and Satan knows that if you ever get the revelation of who you really are this is and where you're going there is no devil in hell that can stop them the war rages on it rages on for your soul that's why we feel trapped at times trapped in these bodies and as long as this great secret is not revealed to you you'll always feel trapped the prophet of God says that when the plans were all drawed up oh Jesus was given his church his bride he said you came into the world and died you redeemed her you Justified she never did it at the first place he was trapped into it he was blind we don't remember that no no because we bypassed our the office so we never did it in the first place where was the first place and there was war in heaven we never sinned in the first place therefore we can't sin in the last place again we did not sin in the beginning and if we didn't sin at the beginning but the reason that we can be redeemed because we never fell in our spirit we make mistakes and we fall in the flesh but in our spirit we never fell betterness in the beginning Los Angeles do I have some Believers here we were trapped in the beginning watch what he says here he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the Water by the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible says your first husband you were married to this world is that one had to die but now the anointed bridegroom which foreign as the eagle stirth her nest the Heavenly being this bird this Eagle in a cage was born for those atmospheres and stratospheres and then big for the rest of his might is but oh I've seen sights worse than that when I see men and women who were born to be Sons and Daughters of God walking about in this world is about upon this Earth trying to satisfy their longing with some worldly pleasure trapped in Mortal life they have never gone on a trip back we must remember I'm closing now he said Lord Senor I've done everything that you told me to do and here we are yeah what must I do Lord I must have this conference Contigo brother Billy's destination is sealed is yours do you know where you're going to hello everybody we can be churchy we can be very religious and not know where we're going hello everybody I'm going to say it again how many of you know where you're going to we need to be reminded that's what the Holy Ghost was given foreign not for that which we would not for that we would be uncloged but clothes that mortality must be swallowed up of life de la vida when you come church and

was some writing now none of us have really heard these words but I would like to read you something that my father left us on the more and more I read it as I was sitting in my room before we came I

one more time see him dragging up that elk uh I miss my dad but the other day in church my son uses my old Bible and uh he started crying and I came down and yeah I looked at him and I looked at my wife and my dad wrote me a message when I was 16 years old I'd like to read it for you because these are his words that he would tell us now this letter was meant to me but I believe if we all have
