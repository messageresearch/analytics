[Music] [Music] amen god bless that beautiful special we all stand to our feet at this time we're gonna get ready to hear the word of god it's a great privilege and honor to introduce the message this evening we'll be hearing our founding pastor and the message will be it is finished by our founding pastor so with this song we're going to introduce the word of god this evening so let's just sing it with all our hearts amen [Music] well in a manger long ago well i know it's really so a babe was born to save them from their sins well god saw him on the shore it was a lamp forever woe the christ the crucified of calvary oh i love i love that man from galilee from galilee or he's gone so very very much for me oh he's forgiving all my sin place the holy ghost for them oh i love i love that man from galilee oh the public went to pray in the temple there one day he cried o lord be merciful to me oh he was forgiven of every sin and a peace that came with it settled from galilee [Music] foreign [Music] the dumb was made to talk oh that power was broken with love upon the seas well the blind was made to see i know it could only be [Music] [Music] very very much for me oh he's forgiven all my sin place the holy ghost with it [Music] amen i just love him with all my heart let us all be seated and as i'm the message was it is finished and in this message our founding pastor opened up with the scripture john 19. so if you all would open your bibles to john 19 verse 28 when you have it you can say man i hear a little more after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith by thirst now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost amen god bless you [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] some of you won't understand me very much this is something they've gone through many times but this this thing to me it keeps keeps on unfolding to you that don't understand this is what is called the ark or the tabernacle in the wilderness amen this is what accompanied the children of israel or or m there [Music] and i want you to get this first part because when i get to the eco-food you won't catch it we find that it had like i said three places and when israel came out of egypt what it was full of worms that was what was taken out what was taken from here apart was taken into the holy place they made 12 cakes that represented the 12 tribes of israel now from this same manner the same one none other no one could go into this place but the high priest only once a year now the mana here the mana that was taken here to the camps one day that's why you find people that come to church they might get a blessing then they don't want to come no more but the next day it's working [Music] [Music] but in the holy of holies [Music] [Music] um [Music] like this [Music] if you could picture it you would picture like a tent and remember here all right here is the people now right here the guards the guards that were here that's what [Music] nobody could come in here [Music] not everybody can come in here [Music] [Music] chooses that's why you asked people come to church they said i don't want to go to church that's right it's correct because you haven't been called you know i mean let god call you [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] stone we find that when uh [Music] and this is very important it is important i hope you understand this gospel is you are protected you should thank god for this i thank god for this bible because well why do you do what you do [Music] is [Music] every [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you have such a [Music] [Music] [Applause] jesus [Music] everybody has [Music] if you are in god's system you are going to have to enter in through these three places [Music] if you do not accept god you can eat bread [Music] if you [Music] [Music] [Music] jesus christ [Music] persona [Music] this church says you [Music] [Applause] you can find a church that will permit the woman to do [Music] [Music] [Applause] you want nothing else [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] how to [Music] [Music] i got this from the bible [Applause] [Music] regarding a system [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's always [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i promise l the holy of holies [Music] no because if i say something and somebody says all i can say is they don't believe the bible say well [Music] [Music] he says because you said that the virgin mary had more children i didn't [Music] i never [Music] you must be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins [Music] jesus christ i'll give you the keys to the kingdom that's why we get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ somebody comes and says well i don't believe that or somebody [Applause] [Music] even jesus christ [Music] [Music] you understand my guinness now watch how many of you believe wanted to stay that jesus is the beginning of the creation of god [Music] god was never [Music] who may [Music] [Music] watch carefully we know i don't want to get into a little part here he existed up himself here is him now jesus christ jesus and when you see that so you would say well jesus christ is one and elohim is another evil [Music] is different stages [Music] this is very important [Music] [Applause] is a spiritual as a spirit i understand so when he made jesus christ amen [Music] manifested in the fight [Music] [Music] [Music] is is or did we lose his likeness did [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i don't believe in two souls
