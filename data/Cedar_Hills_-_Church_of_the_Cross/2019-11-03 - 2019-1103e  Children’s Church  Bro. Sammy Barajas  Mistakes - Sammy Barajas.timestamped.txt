[31:51] honest you guys don't make no mistakes
[31:53] not even little ones right so today
[32:01] we're gonna talk about a man that made
[32:03] many mistakes in the Bible but Brown
[32:06] says he's a man of many mistakes you
[32:09] know we're gonna talk about this man but
[32:12] I need all you guys has helped has
[32:14] helped me yeah so I need you guys to
[32:16] like this put it right over your head
[32:20] this is your imagination cap we're gonna
[32:22] put it on Kay I'm gonna tell a story and
[32:24] you guys gonna imagine it in your mind
[32:26] one two all right there you go it's on
[32:33] now in this story we have the disciples
[32:38] in a ship there on the sea we have Jesus
[32:42] on a mountain he's praying they just got
[32:45] done feeding multitudes of people and
[32:48] Jesus needed to gain his strength back
[32:51] so he went to the mountain to pray now
[32:54] he's on the mountain praying the
[32:56] disciples are here on the ship here's a
[32:57] little it's not much of a ship it's
[33:00] more of a boat John boat I called it the
[33:04] John 3:16 boat dock that was pretty cool
[33:07] so here they are on the boat they're
[33:12] going in Jesus on the mountain praying
[33:14] the disciples are on the ship
[33:15] the waves are rocking back and forth the
[33:18] Sun is going down and it's now the
[33:21] evening time the Bible says but all of a
[33:25] sudden the winds start to concur and the
[33:27] waves start
[33:29] to go high and high and the ship just
[33:30] starts maybe this does a back flip or a
[33:32] front flip or whatever whatever is doing
[33:34] the disciples on the ship and they're
[33:37] all they're all freaking out they're all
[33:39] scared maybe you have one of the guys
[33:43] with the bucket maybe the waters coming
[33:44] onto the ship and when the disciples has
[33:46] a bucket he's throwing all the water out
[33:48] of the ship as fast as you can
[33:49] maybe there's another one trying to pick
[33:51] up the anchor but it's too heavy and he
[33:52] can't get it out and then maybe there's
[33:55] a man Peter and Peter maybe he's trying
[33:58] to bring down the sail do you guys know
[34:00] what the sail is on the ship on the boat
[34:02] what is it the wind you know what it is
[34:09] it's this piece right here it's kind of
[34:11] broken but it's this piece right here
[34:14] it's what picks up the wind and it makes
[34:16] a ship to go forward right so Peters
[34:18] there he's trying to pull it down and I
[34:21] was pulling it down he looks up and he
[34:23] looks and there's someone walking on the
[34:27] water
[34:28] could you imagine there on the sea and a
[34:32] ship and it's rocking back and forth and
[34:34] it almost looks like it's gonna sink
[34:36] they're throwing the water out there
[34:37] trying to get the anchor Peter's trying
[34:38] to pull the sail down and then all of a
[34:40] sudden there's a man walking on the
[34:43] water that's got to be pretty scary huh
[34:47] would you be scared I know I would be
[34:49] scared so here they are and then someone
[34:52] cries out it's a spirit does anyone know
[34:57] what the man on the water says
[35:07] so the man on the water says be of good
[35:10] cheer it is I be not afraid and this man
[35:15] that's talking is Jesus he sees the
[35:17] disciples on the ship he sees a ship
[35:19] going crazy so he's walking towards them
[35:21] he wants to see what's going on maybe
[35:23] just be of good cheer it is I be not
[35:27] afraid
[35:27] and instantly Peter knew who was talking
[35:31] he knew that it was Jesus he said Lord
[35:35] Jesus if that's you on the water
[35:38] if that's you on the water can would you
[35:40] allow me to come to you does anyone know
[35:44] what Jesus says next Hey does anyone
[35:48] else know what he says he says come so
[35:54] Peter he's he's excited right he has all
[35:56] the faith in the world right now he's
[35:58] excited so he steps out of the boat and
[36:02] this is a small boat okay obviously I
[36:06] don't fit in this boat but he steps out
[36:09] of the boat he takes his first step on
[36:10] the water
[36:12] he's walking on the water now Peter now
[36:16] let's stop real quick Peter he's a human
[36:19] being everybody go like this feel that
[36:23] that's called skin that's awesome laughs
[36:30] now Peters a human being human beings
[36:35] are not supposed to walk on water right
[36:36] it's a little odd and maybe all right I
[36:40] got a question but this is only for the
[36:42] kids okay how many take baths
[36:50] okay you guys all take baths okay so
[36:54] when you take a bath you fill the tub up
[36:55] with water
[36:56] maybe you sit in the tub and are you are
[36:59] you sitting on the water no oh you're
[37:02] sitting in the tub right the water is
[37:04] covering you taking it back all right
[37:07] how many go swimming all right so when
[37:11] you go swimming and you step into the
[37:12] water you're not walking on the water
[37:14] are you know you're swimming you're in
[37:16] the pool the water is covering you
[37:18] you're a human being
[37:19] so here's Peter he steps out of the boat
[37:26] Jesus has come he steps out of the boat
[37:29] and he's walking on water but the crazy
[37:34] thing is Peter's not even worried about
[37:36] the water right now does anybody know
[37:38] why he's not worried about the water
[37:42] because he has faith because he knows
[37:49] God is with him
[37:56] because god's in front of him that's
[37:58] exactly right
[37:59] he has his eyes on Jesus so he's not
[38:04] even worried about walking on the water
[38:06] and I wasn't even thinking about it he
[38:07] just wants to get to where Jesus is that
[38:10] but now you guys remember I asked you
[38:14] know anyone's made mistakes right
[38:16] so here Peter is walking on the water
[38:19] going towards Jesus and for a split
[38:22] second he turns his head and he looks at
[38:26] the winds he looks at the waves maybe he
[38:29] sees the disciples on the ship and it's
[38:31] just going crazy so what begins to
[38:33] happen he loses his faith yeah he uses
[38:39] his faith doubt starts to come into his
[38:42] mind in his heart so immediately he
[38:44] steps in
[38:45] oh he starts to sink under the water is
[38:48] that funny here did my face jiggle a
[38:51] little bit yeah so he starts to sink in
[38:56] the water and immediately Jesus help me
[39:00] save me Lord right is that funny - I'm
[39:06] not a good actor I'm sorry so here he is
[39:16] they save me Lord and what does Jesus do
[39:20] does he stand there he says well you
[39:23] wanted to come onto the water what does
[39:27] he do he helps him right immediately he
[39:32] stretches out his hand and he helps him
[39:36] but now that's not all that happened
[39:38] see Peter he wasn't lit off so easy as
[39:44] soon as Jesus grabbed his hand does
[39:46] anybody know what he tells him No
[39:54] what was that what was that he says o
[39:59] thou of little faith
[40:01] and to Peter that was a spiritual
[40:04] spanking
[40:05] hey that probably didn't feel real good
[40:07] to him this was God Almighty telling him
[40:11] oh thou of little faith when he said
[40:14] that he's probably heard him so deep
[40:16] down inside his soul
[40:17] ouch so did he really just tell me that
[40:20] a little faith
[40:22] no when I was little I made a lot of
[40:28] mistakes a lot and man to the rain can
[40:34] testify to this I was always getting
[40:36] beat up and down in the aisle I was
[40:39] always getting beat
[40:40] but these beatings were good for me when
[40:42] I made a mistake I've got a whoopin and
[40:43] the whooping was good for me it helped
[40:45] me to grow it helped me to learn
[40:48] sometimes I mean I'd get beat and I get
[40:52] even worse and then I'd get beat again
[40:53] and I'll just get beat all night that's
[40:55] how it was
[40:57] but this story tells something a little
[41:00] different Peter he just got his
[41:05] spiritual spanking right he stepped out
[41:07] of the boat walked on the water fell he
[41:09] got a spiritual spanking his all his
[41:12] friends in the ship are about to sink
[41:15] instead of getting back on the ship when
[41:17] Jesus helped him instead of sitting
[41:18] there sad like this his hands crossed
[41:23] maybe do you do that when you get in
[41:25] trouble no you don't do that
[41:27] you jump up happy huh yeah so instead of
[41:34] doing instead of sitting there moping
[41:36] sad the Bible says that they began to
[41:39] worship Jesus saying over truth thou are
[41:43] the son of God how many can do that
[41:46] after you get a whoopin maybe you can
[41:48] worship God a little bit does that kind
[41:52] of seems a little odd I still get
[41:57] weapons to this day I still get weapons
[42:00] I get well we cause grown-ups a
[42:02] spiritual uppercut so let's
[42:05] right here in the chin my pastor gives
[42:08] them to me sometimes so here they are
[42:12] they begin to worship Jesus instead of
[42:14] moping around they begin to worship and
[42:16] a member of Peter he's still wet
[42:19] he didn't dry off instantly he's still
[42:22] wet from his mistake but he's not
[42:24] letting that bother him
[42:26] maybe the devil's they're trying to tell
[42:28] him he just made a mistake shouldn't be
[42:30] worshipping God right now remember the
[42:32] mistake you made yesterday maybe the
[42:34] devil tries to tell you guys that but
[42:37] remember Jesus is there to help you back
[42:39] up you make it right you don't have to
[42:42] worry about those things you can come to
[42:44] church the next service and worship Him
[42:46] with all your heart and that's my
[42:48] message to you guys this evening the
[42:51] little children and maybe the youth and
[42:53] maybe anyone else that it can help as a
[42:56] Christian we're gonna make mistakes I
[42:58] still make a lot of mistakes but if you
[43:02] make them right and you seek after the
[43:04] one who can fix the mistake or cover it
[43:07] with his blood you won't have to worry
[43:10] about those things anymore and I said
[43:13] that's my my message to you guys and I
[43:16] pray that he can help you guys I pray
[43:19] that it can be a blessing to you guys
[43:22] how many know my son Sammy all right how
[43:28] many hear him almost every service
[43:29] crying he's probably the loudest baby in
[43:33] here hmm now he makes those mistakes
[43:36] right he cries he acts he acts up and he
[43:39] wants to get up and scream he wants to
[43:41] run down the aisle he likes running to
[43:42] the drums he has something with the
[43:44] drums will see some down the years maybe
[43:46] he'll be the next drummer of the church
[43:48] he makes those mistakes but does that
[43:51] make him not my son anymore
[43:54] no he's still my son do I still love him
[43:57] yes I love him and I forgive him for
[44:00] those things and maybe he does get a
[44:02] little spanking when he gets home but I
[44:05] still love him and I'm always gonna love
[44:07] him he's always gonna be my son and I'm
[44:10] sure that your parents feel the same way
[44:11] about all of you guys if you guys make a
[44:13] mistake maybe you get a little spanking
[44:17] many years get home
[44:19] but your parents still love you and they
[44:21] do it because they care for you and the
[44:23] Lord feels the same way for us maybe
[44:25] we're gonna get a spiritual spanking but
[44:28] it's because he loves us and we gotta
[44:29] continue and we gotta press forward and
[44:33] worshipping Him and living for him every
[44:35] day you guys I'll get that
[44:38] yeah good I'm sorry was very short but
