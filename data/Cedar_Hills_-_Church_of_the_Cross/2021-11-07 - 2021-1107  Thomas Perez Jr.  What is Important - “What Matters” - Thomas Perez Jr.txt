and all the glory gloria in the name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated amen give me all your energy and you can give me everything right now is that all right we don't have service tonight we want you to maintain yourself safe right now silver city is number one in the whole united states of america per capita we're number one silver city this thing will not last forever but i'll tell you what will last forever that is the eternal word of god and so this is where we draw our strength and this is where we we gathered together this morning undivided attention for about the next 45 minutes we want everybody to rejoice in the word of god my father used this scripture in the 90s in los angeles and there was a man in a wheelchair aviano i was translating for him there was a man in a wheelchair on his right-hand side and he said these words faith is our victory they started in about five minutes into his message and he turned around and he looked at that man and he said brother do you believe that faith is your victory [Music] is what happened to the people their faith went through the roof now that is where we come from that is what makes us do what we got to do that's what makes us do what we do even in a pandemic because for whatsoever is born of god and you come with me right now and you can you draw to the banister of heaven for whatsoever is born of god again if you have been born of a god he has not seen the lord again if you have been born of god he has not seen the new ability you overcome the world and this is the victory what is it that matters in our life yes what is important and what matters in our life i'm going to ask you again if i gave you three boxes and i would tell you you're gonna move to another house and you only can put whatever you can put in three boxes how many people would be able to do that we got one candidate back there now i don't know about you but i i would have to put what is more important what matters look important again if i was to give you a one box think about it what would you put in that box that would be the only thing that you could take with you your favorite dress substitute your favorite shirt maybe would you take your bible yeah but i got in my house a bunch of junk you think oh man and i and i and i said i don't know what that means but that sounds pretty good a bunch of stuff that you don't even know what it is okay and so we thought no we're not gonna do that no no no why don't we empty out the junk that we already have in our shed has been in there for 10 years and the only one that's using it is the rats and the squirrels so in there we had boxes of things but you know it comes a day where we had uh brother brother julian did our roof and and part of the bottom was filled with whatever he scraped off of part of the roof but that day was junk day for me the so we just started throwing whatever there was if you're not going to use it that week and don't look at me like you are no no if you have stuff that you have not used for one week the possibility of you ever using again is probably never that can say well i wish he would have left me that because one day i'm going to use it and then you're going to pass off the scene and then your great grandkids still had not yet ever used so i always say if we don't use it in a week we're probably not ever going to use it but you say brother it was my great great great great grandfathers and it looks like it was your great great great great grandfather that's fine at one time it had a great use but now you just have it there as a memorial memorial because you're never going to use it because you don't want to break it but i want you to know the scripture tells us in matthew the sixth chapter 19th verse lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust dot corrupt up for yourselves treasures where somebody tell me where we're gonna lay up treasures now 25 verses take no thought for your life you know i guarantee you this morning that many of us que muchos de nosotros in eating breakfast were already thinking what we were going to have for lunch i appreciate that i'm thinking that by the time lunch comes around you're already thinking what you're going to have for dinner thank you i appreciate it but i also know that tambien you're thinking what you're gonna what shall you put on is not the life more than meat and the body then raiment the sparrow was going from one side to the other ese and this other sparrow came to have a have a talk with him and they started thinking about what it was to be human and they said haven't you noticed that as we fly no no estamos bolando the humans they have a lot of preoccupations they started talking to each other maybe they don't have a heavenly father like we do not and that's fine if you have a million dollars you want to have 2 million but it's simple like this the homeless man is wondering what it would be like to drive in that lamborghini the man in the lamborghini in a lamborghini it the homeless man says hello i wish i was bill gates you said i said bill gates bill gates is divorced now i wonder who's the rich man now are you with me i wonder who the rich man now is when the love of his life doesn't want to be with him but his billions cannot buy his wife thank you lamborghini is looking for a tree to wrap out wrap around his lamborghini and end his life be careful who you want to be like all the animals that live in your there's rats that live in your house not mine yesterday no i mean you're not only here

make those noises crickets what's the crickets how many like to hear those whenever he going like this right theo he's calling for rain how many get an apple from your tree and a worm lives in it throw it away because there's a worm in it good for you if it didn't kill the worm it's not going to kill you what i'm getting to you this morning is simple this okay they live at your house rent free

said it is good it is very good this is have so many hang ups and the sparrows circle our house and we buy a nice car and that's all right that's good that's wonderful and then they look at each other and they say they're gonna have to all work for 20 don't we have a heavenly father celestial now i believe i i i i love to to live where i work i work in a nice house i love to drive a nice vehicle every day you can come in no no no no no no would you rather have a car that breaks down no no no no you know one time i tried four i didn't like it um we we try to keep on going up it's in the human instinct to be better today than you were yesterday are you with me you want a better college for your children you want a better job for yourself [Applause] consider the lilies of the field how they grow como crescent how they they toil not neither do they spin what's what's worse are you in we're in 28. that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these i believe i read one time that solomon's temple cost 40 billion dollars of today's money indeed i believe that they said that his terrier tears those the charioteers with silver bars what a great time but solomon in all his glory in gloria was not arrayed like solomon many of us don't even know how much 100 dollar bill is indoors 10 000 bucks and you think you're rich you come to the house of the lord for your heavenly father verse 32 know that you have need of all these things amen see we have it all our eyes should say i have it all backwards we we we i think that if god gives me this that that i found you know

abraham abraham i'm going to give you this big old territory nobody had the gumption or the courage to do it but king david why are we living in this little piece of property when all of this man belongs to us and he starts conquering the philistines what did he have in his hand getaniyan sumano the key if i told you upstairs we have a big old vault [Music] this is the same way with the scripture you say every promise of god belongs to me but it needs a key is is substance is the substantia substance substantial without faith scene there cannot be no substance is the active ingredient okay do you want it located if i told you do you want that that that big old that big old safe up there and i would we'd have a mad stampede in this place the other day in texas in texas

attack is what an attack if you've ever heard anything that is so true hear this right now there can you see the greatest battle was ever fought there's only two forces of faith is to try to get you

church sunday night mr silver i i have my my wedding ring hello you can if he can get you brother joe to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed [Applause] in the most critical of time when it looked like jesus could not fulfill jesus they were looking to see how many promises jesus would fulfill jesus and they would look hey no that's not him that's not him that's not him oh isn't until his last last hour after ultima in his last hour he fulfilled over 300 promises in one hour what i'm for the this it's already written that you can yes faith is our victory is substance it's the substantial way is look he's disarmed you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay that down what does the back of the book tell us amen and when jesus was crucified brother hector i was with him man when he was buried i was with him why do they tell me do you believe this february 28 1963 didn't happen i was there yesterday and unbelievers [Music] you know when you see my papa many people said he had a gift brother bernie says it worked in every area of his life when you see i told my buddy amigo brother

never live in the streets i drive a car you'll drive a car i eat a burrito then it means and i don't want to get into brother abraham's line but there was one thing god could not do and that was to lie [Applause] he saved you all the way [Music] [Applause] and he knows everything about carmen he's the one that gave your mama to put you that name he gave you the name he gives you your position [Music] [Applause] because we have god way out here and as long as he's way out here he can't help us right here but that's why he gave us the holy ghost [Music] so he unlocked he gives you the key whatever you bind on earth you're not ready are you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that the first thing he would put in his box is his bible [Music] you won't have enough room to to put everything that is in there he tells us see if there won't be enough room and it will overflow have you ever had a promise that god gave you did you get it were you scared after you got it because it comes with responsibility now it unlocks another promise and another problem by the time you know it promises start happening in your life things my father would tell me this i can't even think about it and god
