[38:01] yes
[38:10] it was our turn brother ben brother
[38:11] abraham and your servant to speak about
[38:14] this conflict on ukraine
[38:31] like to ask you did you know russia was
[38:33] the biggest nation out of all nations
[38:56] it is bigger than the the planet pluto
[38:58] esta grande este pais this country is so
[39:02] big
[39:07] with two
[39:08] limits with two continents
[39:39] and i was searching and
[40:07] of the world
[40:23] lord in this hour we'd like to give you
[40:24] thanks
[40:27] we are here as children
[40:31] lord hungry and and thirsty for
[40:33] righteousness
[40:36] lord
[41:03] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[41:46] shall
[42:02] i'd like to ask a question to our
[42:04] brother abraham emel
[42:06] we've read the scripture
[42:19] what could you tell us of the scripture
[42:21] that with something that that would be
[42:23] happening today
[42:24] well i mean
[42:26] our our subject that we're talking about
[42:29] is the ukraine ukraine
[42:34] as you see
[42:36] different um
[42:37] different different things you can go
[42:39] just about
[42:41] anywhere any direction
[42:46] as i look at it you you have to look it
[42:49] is
[42:50] is what the when brother branham talks
[42:52] about the three curtains
[42:56] cortinas
[43:03] i won't get into the other ones but when
[43:04] he talks about the iron curtain
[43:07] not a lot of information that he gives
[43:10] about that other than to watch
[43:16] what i see there is
[43:18] is it's a sign
[43:21] it's it's just like to me it's just like
[43:24] a road sign
[43:28] traveling down the road
[43:32] you have a yellow caution sign telling
[43:34] you there's a turn up ahead
[43:38] of
[44:06] caution
[44:08] so when i look at that um just speaking
[44:11] of the signs
[44:14] there's
[44:15] there's three things a godly sign
[44:18] was given for
[44:20] us
[44:27] another one was to execute divine
[44:29] judgment the second is
[44:33] and the last one was to
[45:01] he's the one who died for our sins
[45:04] crucified for murder for everything
[45:10] that was paid there
[45:13] thinking of the side of these signs
[45:18] you see that the prophet of god he
[45:20] he uh
[45:21] he refers to that in in the story of
[45:25] titus
[45:30] and so i want to talk about that for
[45:31] just a couple of minutes um
[45:34] as as just to so
[45:36] so you you see a lot of you you hear a
[45:38] lot of the story historian stories told
[45:42] of of jesus
[45:46] and we understand that that the jews
[45:48] rejected
[45:50] the god-given sign and that was given to
[45:53] them
[45:56] so when you see that
[45:58] you don't ever hear
[46:00] the
[46:01] the divine
[46:02] uh judgment that came with that
[46:08] he speaks of that prophet
[46:11] he refers it to
[46:13] titus
[46:14] roman
[46:16] emperor
[46:18] romano like the way that titus what he
[46:22] did was he he surrounded
[46:26] jerusalem and when he surrounded
[46:29] jerusalem
[46:32] it wasn't like a battle like you're
[46:34] thinking in your mind
[46:38] what titus did look at those it was
[46:55] so during this time when when titus
[46:57] surrounded
[46:59] surrounded jerusalem
[47:01] jerusalem he waited for for the the
[47:04] passover it was a big celebration a
[47:07] jewish celebration
[47:11] where there were there were uh all the
[47:14] jews from all that all in all the parts
[47:17] of that world
[47:18] they all gathered together
[47:22] and that was
[47:27] you see how how they all when they all
[47:30] got there
[47:31] is when titus surrounded the city
[47:36] the way that titus did it
[47:38] was he blocked off every gate that was
[47:42] coming in and going out
[47:44] there
[47:46] there was no escape
[47:49] so
[47:50] when he did this
[47:54] you know in in your mind you start
[47:56] thinking of a battle
[48:00] the way that titus did this was
[48:02] he would send in armies at different
[48:05] times
[48:07] make them believe that they were under
[48:11] full attack all the time
[48:17] but what he he did was
[48:20] he he was striking fear into them
[48:27] so the thing that happened was a great
[48:29] famine broke out he lost
[48:39] it was it was a trap that he had set for
[48:42] them
[48:45] and they said outside of the city
[48:50] making jerusalem think that they were
[48:52] under under heavy attack all the time
[48:58] things like that that brother jerry
[49:02] talked about the famine
[49:06] and he was talking about the difference
[49:08] between a famine and starvation
[49:12] during this time when this was going
[49:22] josephus is the one who gives this
[49:24] report of what really took place
[49:27] josephus
[49:34] it got so bad for them
[49:38] that
[49:39] they began to eat the bark off of the
[49:41] trees
[49:49] they began to kill their very own
[49:51] children
[49:54] and they ate they were eating their own
[49:56] children
[49:59] so you see the mental state that they
[50:02] were in venezuela
[50:04] and then so when josephus gives the
[50:07] report when joseph is reported he says
[50:09] yes
[50:10] a lot of them died through battle he
[50:12] says
[50:15] but the majority of them died from the
[50:19] famine
[50:21] so you you see
[50:23] you see everything that happened there
[50:27] and and you you see how ukraine used it
[50:32] they were surrounded
[50:34] the same way
[50:36] devastated
[50:37] and all of that but the most beautiful
[50:39] thing
[50:40] here
[50:44] that i look at
[50:46] me dad
[50:47] because
[50:48] it all sounds like pure devastation
[51:20] he begins to talk about about that great
[51:24] trap the battle that took place there
[51:31] and he begins to tell the people
[51:34] not
[52:15] and jesus starts to tell them jesus you
[52:18] know you you could discern the face of
[52:20] the sky whether in this arena
[52:24] but you can't discern
[52:25] the times
[52:30] he said and and he starts to to call him
[52:32] hypocrites
[52:34] and he says you know
[52:36] this wicked and adulterous generation
[52:43] but when he's talking about that he says
[52:46] but the there's one true sign that is
[52:48] going to be given
[52:51] and that sign is is the jonas sign he is
[52:55] i'll leave you with the with the sign of
[52:57] jonas
[53:12] and he says
[53:26] and if the reason it was given
[53:30] it was to get the bride ready
[53:34] it wasn't given for those that were
[53:36] seeking
[53:38] any signs
[53:40] and
[54:04] that it becomes like a warning from god
[54:34] testimonials
[54:38] so
[54:39] when
[54:40] the the whole thing about it is
[54:43] is that the sign is not just a sign
[54:50] that vindicates
[55:13] you see like like
[55:15] i mean i could go on forever
[55:17] you guys want to jump in
[55:21] you see like in the times of moses
[55:25] the whole thing about it is this is that
[55:28] is that what was the sign given for
[55:32] you know god gave a sign
[55:35] for one purpose
[55:38] and that purpose was to get the
[55:40] attention of the people
[55:44] so
[55:45] in in the times of moses
[55:48] and i'm going to wrap it up with this
[55:52] so in the times of moses
[55:55] the first sign that god gave him
[55:58] deliver the people
[56:00] pueblo
[56:14] and and uh
[56:18] they they they go and they throw down a
[56:20] serpent
[56:24] if you look at it they're able to
[56:26] produce the same signs
[56:37] you got to look at what the difference
[56:38] was at the end of at the end of the of
[56:41] the they were producing a sign the
[56:44] profit of the
[56:45] of that time he produced
[56:50] that that they produced
[56:53] what did they have that backed it up
[57:09] maybe i'm not i'm not saying it just the
[57:12] way that the prophet says it forgive me
[57:17] it was a worldly spirit
[57:21] this sign
[57:24] the difference was was that moses had
[57:27] thus saith the lord
[57:30] all the difference in the world
[57:34] what happened was he took the sign
[57:38] and
[57:38] he he made it speak he's okay so you see
[57:42] that like the thing that attracts
[57:45] he gets the attention of the people okay
[57:50] their attention through a sign right
[57:59] what got his attention
[58:03] what got his attention was the burning
[58:05] bush okay
[58:24] but the prophet of god tells us
[58:26] that what produced the voice
[58:31] the approach that moses had
[58:46] but
[58:47] that's what i got just look
[59:02] to
[59:05] [Music]
[59:30] that has a voice
[59:58] we can see how russia decision they took
[1:00:01] the decision
[1:00:04] to enter into danburys
[1:00:08] when russia takes the step immediately
[1:00:12] is
[1:00:40] we've read here of of hunger pestilence
[1:00:43] wars and rumors of ours
[1:00:50] now we've heard that there was a sign
[1:00:51] there had to be a voice and it had to be
[1:00:53] scriptural
[1:01:05] a voice a scripture that clears up what
[1:01:07] is happening in ukraine
[1:01:09] well first of all the i believe the sign
[1:01:11] is the prophet so we gotta
[1:01:14] we gotta start there
[1:01:16] so
[1:01:18] we have
[1:01:20] machine guns ready to go
[1:01:38] and as we know brother abe was was
[1:01:40] talking about the current that he was
[1:01:41] talking about we know is russia
[1:01:46] the prophet tells us about that
[1:01:50] but you know we you know
[1:01:53] not to jump on the bandwagon of many
[1:01:55] politicians but
[1:01:57] [Music]
[1:01:59] a lot of the
[1:02:00] information that we see is false news
[1:02:02] you know
[1:02:04] information
[1:02:06] you know through the guidance of our
[1:02:08] pastor i was able to to watch some
[1:02:10] videos today on
[1:02:11] believers that were in in ukraine
[1:02:18] ukrainian and it painted a wholly
[1:02:21] totally different picture than what i
[1:02:24] had imagined
[1:02:30] you know as as
[1:02:33] both me and brother diego were in the
[1:02:34] military as
[1:02:36] knowing how
[1:02:38] these wars and and or these conflicts
[1:02:46] so there were so many red flags that
[1:02:48] came up
[1:02:51] on what the news is trying to paint us
[1:02:56] you know because when when a military
[1:02:58] force wants to do something
[1:03:03] we don't read it on the news until it's
[1:03:05] over
[1:03:08] you know they they go and take care of
[1:03:10] business and a couple of days later we
[1:03:12] realized oh shoot that happened bum yeah
[1:03:29] you know
[1:03:30] i believe
[1:03:32] that putin knew exactly what he was
[1:03:34] doing
[1:03:38] he wanted the world to know before he
[1:03:40] even stepped foot in ukraine
[1:03:47] he wanted everybody to know look at me
[1:03:49] this is what i'm about to do
[1:03:55] the smoke was in the air
[1:04:01] and i believe with all my heart that the
[1:04:02] scripture was beautiful is being
[1:04:04] fulfilled in our midst
[1:04:11] i believe that the true movement isn't
[1:04:13] happening in russia right now
[1:04:19] because brother branham tells us in the
[1:04:21] late you'll see in church
[1:04:56] you know so we know there's a because of
[1:04:58] the the voice of the prophet the warning
[1:05:00] that he gave us we know there are so
[1:05:02] many other things that are taking place
[1:05:10] you know when the god in in god of the
[1:05:12] evil age he says amen
[1:05:16] so reads the word now my text this
[1:05:19] morning is
[1:05:34] this message points out the evil of this
[1:05:38] age
[1:05:42] and it is fitting to prophecy for this
[1:05:45] evil age
[1:05:49] and he says it's my belief that every
[1:05:53] that the bible has the answer for every
[1:05:56] age
[1:06:02] it's already written in the bible just
[1:06:06] for the believer of that age
[1:06:10] so what the prophet of god is trying to
[1:06:12] tell us
[1:06:15] to search the scriptures
[1:06:24] because you a lot of times we
[1:06:27] search the message we search the
[1:06:28] scriptures
[1:06:30] is
[1:06:42] is
[1:06:47] you know and and just to me when brother
[1:06:50] abe was speaking i was writing some
[1:06:51] questions down here
[1:06:56] what warning did people have
[1:07:34] it's got to bring
[1:07:36] you know a sense of urgency
[1:07:38] to us here in the united
[1:07:54] so when we go and we look into russia
[1:07:59] you know in 1956 i believe the prophet
[1:08:02] told us that it
[1:08:04] he said
[1:08:05] america had its chance
[1:08:15] and it's not by some coincidence
[1:08:19] that during that time frame
[1:08:22] that all of a sudden who shows up to the
[1:08:24] united states
[1:08:28] we play that short clip brother
[1:08:36] the key to khrushchev is there are some
[1:08:38] instances where you may be ah
[1:08:41] for example in the
[1:08:43] development of your of the thrust of
[1:08:45] your rockets for the investigation of
[1:08:47] outer space
[1:08:48] there may be some instances for example
[1:08:50] color television where we're ahead of
[1:08:51] you
[1:08:53] in order for both of us
[1:08:55] for both of us
[1:08:56] for both of us
[1:09:32] you know this kitchen debate was two
[1:09:34] rulers
[1:09:38] trying to fight for power
[1:09:42] and you saw how khrushchev was so he he
[1:09:46] was so
[1:09:47] why did what is the word
[1:09:50] he was
[1:09:51] charismatic or he was
[1:09:53] he believed what he was fighting for
[1:09:56] charismatic
[1:09:57] and he was talking about president nixon
[1:09:59] nope
[1:10:09] you guys claim television we're gonna
[1:10:11] we're gonna get television before you do
[1:10:13] it
[1:10:19] because and the reason i wanted to bring
[1:10:21] the united states
[1:10:25] we could see what's happening in ukraine
[1:10:29] but what does it have to do with us here
[1:10:33] you know so here comes this rise of this
[1:10:36] king
[1:10:38] because because the bible types it as
[1:10:40] the king of the north portland
[1:10:45] and i believe i don't know brother diego
[1:10:46] said you know it was almost like a a
[1:10:48] bear that was rising up
[1:10:54] competition began yes
[1:10:58] so you see how communism began to take
[1:11:02] over the world at that point
[1:11:07] don't fear russia
[1:11:25] but what's he doing in ukraine
[1:11:28] what's he doing there questa
[1:11:31] you know i just thought it was
[1:11:33] so
[1:11:34] crazy
[1:11:38] the picture that was painted to the
[1:11:40] world
[1:11:44] how about in hours
[1:11:49] the whole world
[1:11:52] bottled neck russia
[1:11:55] and basically shut
[1:11:57] them down completely
[1:12:02] why did that what picture did that paint
[1:12:13] just like that that never took sides
[1:12:16] with anybody
[1:12:19] but now they're a player
[1:12:23] that shut everything in and out of
[1:12:25] russia
[1:12:29] if the whole world could have done that
[1:12:32] to the big
[1:12:33] dog of that
[1:12:35] industry on that side
[1:12:39] how easy is it going to be
[1:12:43] in this world council of churches
[1:12:46] iglesias and says you know what because
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:13:00] how this picture got painted so fast
[1:13:07] that's why the private guy said watch
[1:13:09] russia
[1:13:12] watch russia
[1:13:14] watch russia observe but what is russia
[1:13:17] really doing
[1:13:20] let's let's go to the scriptures
[1:13:23] i'm going to start off with revelation
[1:13:25] 17
[1:13:29] just so you can see the scripture being
[1:13:31] fulfilled for god have put in their
[1:13:34] hearts
[1:13:36] to fulfill his will
[1:13:40] and to agree
[1:13:43] and give their kingdom unto the beast
[1:13:49] until the words of god be fulfilled
[1:13:55] if russia only knew
[1:14:04] now let's jump to daniel chapter 11.
[1:14:08] daniel capital once
[1:14:14] i'm going to start i'm just going to
[1:14:16] read verse 40 and then we'll jump back
[1:14:18] down
[1:14:20] so just remember this
[1:14:22] particular scripture is here this is at
[1:14:25] the very end of
[1:14:34] and at the time of the end shall the
[1:14:36] king of the south
[1:14:38] push at him
[1:14:43] and the king of the north shall come
[1:14:46] against him like a whirlwind with
[1:14:48] chariots with horsemen
[1:14:51] and with many ships and he shall enter
[1:14:53] into the countries and shall overflow
[1:14:56] and overpass and passover
[1:15:08] last
[1:15:10] because look look what russia is doing
[1:15:12] observing
[1:15:14] what does russia have on their flag
[1:15:18] does anyone know
[1:15:22] brother dan
[1:15:27] so we can see what the hammer is going
[1:15:29] to do back
[1:15:31] that's the first board
[1:15:33] he's going to come and to destroy
[1:15:50] and the 50s where you had the soviet
[1:15:52] union
[1:15:56] with a lot of power
[1:15:58] but you see how that broke up
[1:16:00] 91.
[1:16:03] so here goes russia now starting
[1:16:10] we're talking about the ukraine war okay
[1:16:14] so easy to get to get off track here
[1:16:17] is what is so important
[1:16:20] about ukraine that is
[1:16:23] powerful about it
[1:16:28] why does he want ukraine
[1:16:32] where's the first place that
[1:16:35] yeah where's the first place that
[1:16:38] that putin wanted wanted to start taking
[1:16:40] over
[1:16:44] was it a crimea
[1:16:46] he
[1:16:52] what's so important about that i know i
[1:16:54] know it's the biggest of of those
[1:16:56] countries that that he wants to take
[1:16:57] over but what what is so
[1:16:59] important about this is
[1:17:28] where's the other powerhouse
[1:17:30] saudi arabia
[1:17:33] so he has some competition
[1:17:36] but what if
[1:17:38] peru
[1:17:40] what if
[1:17:41] he could control it all
[1:17:46] wouldn't it be a big
[1:17:48] game changer
[1:17:51] read that brother this is an article
[1:17:56] this is an article that talks of why he
[1:17:59] wanted to go into
[1:18:00] you take that part
[1:18:06] but propaganda aside perhaps the answer
[1:18:10] is more
[1:18:23] on the black sea coast la tierra de
[1:18:26] ukranias
[1:18:27] a la costa del mar negro
[1:18:30] putin also annexes the right to any
[1:18:35] hydrocarbons found in its
[1:18:38] maritime
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:54] energy firms such as exxon mobil
[1:18:58] chevron
[1:18:59] xiao
[1:19:00] repsol
[1:19:01] and
[1:19:04] china exxon mobil shell
[1:19:09] have begun to show real interest in
[1:19:11] working with kiev
[1:19:13] to explore the area and most interested
[1:19:19] energy companies have already found
[1:19:22] interesting deposits
[1:19:24] in russia's black sea zone companies
[1:19:39] and in romanian zones in sonas the
[1:19:42] romania
[1:19:44] trans-eero energy has even found
[1:19:47] commercially
[1:19:49] viable gas reserves under the crimson
[1:19:52] mainland
[1:19:59] at the same time reserves of cheaply
[1:20:02] accessible gas in siberia are running
[1:20:05] low
[1:20:06] tambien esta reservas in siberia
[1:20:13] but even if putin never extracts a drop
[1:20:16] of gas from his
[1:20:18] new territories listen to this part
[1:20:27] the land
[1:20:29] grab will ensure
[1:20:31] that gas prom
[1:20:33] his energy champion will be in charge of
[1:20:36] how
[1:20:37] when
[1:20:38] and by whom this might be done it is
[1:20:49] it will mean that no matter who rules
[1:20:52] ukraine significa
[1:20:58] it can never challenge putin's monopoly
[1:21:01] on energy exports from the region
[1:21:10] oil and gas also shed light on putin's
[1:21:14] interest
[1:21:15] in the
[1:21:16] creamian
[1:21:17] port of
[1:21:20] the poll
[1:21:36] and you see how our
[1:21:38] local administration right now they're
[1:21:40] they're against oil
[1:21:44] administration
[1:21:47] petroleum trying to get everything to
[1:21:48] solar trying to get everything to
[1:21:50] electric cars
[1:22:19] you know and we're not taking anything
[1:22:21] back from ukraine
[1:22:29] you know it's very very powerful to see
[1:22:32] what they're doing
[1:22:35] but russia is a powerhouse
[1:22:39] you know and brother brown tells you
[1:22:43] at the end
[1:22:45] if they're gonna be the tool that
[1:22:48] completely and not starts to annihilate
[1:22:50] everybody
[1:22:54] you can't tell me that the little
[1:22:56] country of ukraine is going to stand
[1:22:57] against them
[1:23:01] i wanted you to see this so you could
[1:23:03] see the scripture being fulfilled
[1:23:26] [Music]
[1:23:28] so daniel 11 36 now and the king shall
[1:23:31] do according to his will and he shall
[1:23:34] exalt himself
[1:23:36] and magnify himself above every god and
[1:23:39] shall speak marvelous things against the
[1:23:42] god of gods
[1:23:43] and shall prosper till the indignation
[1:23:46] be accomplished for that is determined
[1:23:50] shall be done
[1:23:52] you saw the you you see how he had an
[1:23:54] attitude
[1:24:13] that's the attitude of communism that
[1:24:15] has taken over that part of the world
[1:24:21] but church remember what we said there's
[1:24:23] got to be a sense of urgency
[1:24:29] because you look at our government
[1:24:33] it's just another form of communism
[1:24:36] it's corrupt
[1:24:38] it rules over us
[1:24:41] and you know
[1:24:42] there's our our eyes should be open
[1:24:49] neither shall he regard the god of his
[1:24:51] fathers
[1:24:55] nor the desire of woman
[1:25:10] god is capitalized here
[1:25:14] but i can't remember anybody in that
[1:25:16] generation
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:20] i believed in the same god
[1:25:24] they've always believed that there was
[1:25:26] no god
[1:25:28] you know and and that's that's been the
[1:25:30] powerhouse of of how that communism
[1:25:33] began to take over on that part
[1:25:36] yes
[1:25:41] and it's beginning just just like you
[1:25:43] read brother
[1:25:45] what is this war done over there
[1:25:48] yeah i was watching some testimonials
[1:25:51] today
[1:25:55] and it talks about how that every all
[1:25:58] these ukrainians that are leaving the
[1:26:01] country
[1:26:05] they're so much on edge
[1:26:09] that if you cut in line
[1:26:11] just to get out of the country
[1:26:17] you're probably going to die or you're
[1:26:18] going to be in a fist fight
[1:26:33] because many times we think that we're
[1:26:35] the only believers
[1:26:39] we're the only ones that can rise above
[1:26:41] everything
[1:26:44] but it was tremendous hearing how what
[1:26:46] this war in ukraine did to the believers
[1:26:54] have very little food
[1:26:58] no water synagogue they're fighting to
[1:27:01] survive
[1:27:26] because they they knew that they lived
[1:27:29] in a communist country
[1:27:43] because our prophet says in those
[1:27:45] communist countries
[1:27:49] communism is just one percent
[1:27:53] you still have 99 others that are that
[1:27:56] believe christianity is
[1:28:03] once you see the complete unfolding of
[1:28:05] daniel 11.
[1:28:12] once this king turns and starts to go to
[1:28:14] the south
[1:28:18] we're not going to be here
[1:28:21] our time it's got to be that point where
[1:28:23] we're
[1:28:24] we we are taking away tiene
[1:29:22] the time is we don't we have
[1:29:24] less time than what we think
[1:29:29] you could go and and you could see
[1:29:31] 50 years ago
[1:29:35] we were crying there's no
[1:29:44] but we could look at the scripture and
[1:29:46] we could say this day the scripture is
[1:29:48] being fulfilled right
[1:30:03] right now you hear
[1:30:04] very politicians
[1:30:12] speaking about what russia will do or
[1:30:13] will not do all right
[1:30:17] i was a military man so i'll speak like
[1:30:19] a military man
[1:30:24] and i want us to know a little bit more
[1:30:25] about putin
[1:30:29] he's a special man
[1:30:32] he
[1:30:45] he's a man that has graduated he's an
[1:30:47] attorney
[1:30:48] specialist
[1:30:51] and he majored in what is politics
[1:30:59] but the most interesting thing about the
[1:31:01] life of putin
[1:31:07] he served in
[1:31:10] in kgb for many years
[1:31:29] that makes them a a very much an enemy
[1:31:32] of the united states
[1:31:36] that makes them have a special
[1:31:37] characteristic
[1:31:43] when people see
[1:31:44] a pudding
[1:31:47] they cannot describe it
[1:31:51] there's no way they can read him
[1:31:55] and that's the conflict many people have
[1:32:10] dumbass
[1:32:14] simply in one month
[1:32:19] takes over a whole nation
[1:32:24] generally
[1:32:52] the way that people think it will do it
[1:32:56] what he did in ukraine
[1:32:59] it is a symbol or a sign
[1:33:02] that russia is placing
[1:33:06] a
[1:33:18] economically the country of russia
[1:33:22] that is a great error
[1:33:25] and speaking as a military man
[1:33:29] when brother branham speaks to us about
[1:33:30] russia
[1:33:33] he also typifies it as the bearer
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:34:01] of sheer force
[1:34:07] and an explosion against what's
[1:34:09] affecting him
[1:34:12] says
[1:34:15] when russia and china
[1:34:16] act it will be so quick
[1:34:22] the united states will not be able to
[1:34:23] defend itself
[1:34:26] now we're speaking about the signs
[1:34:29] there are many signs
[1:35:11] the same that was told unto the jews
[1:35:16] the sign of jonas
[1:35:19] what was the sign of jonah
[1:35:22] for the bride
[1:35:24] it would be the sign of the resurrection
[1:35:54] between the
[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:22] that's the the purple curtain
[1:36:26] said don't do not fear russia
[1:36:31] but fear the purple curtain
[1:36:36] the the purple curtain is a boycott
[1:36:39] right you won't realize
[1:36:42] but the bride
[1:36:44] has a sign
[1:36:46] that is the resurrection
[1:36:50] the sign
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:46] shall see this sign
[1:37:49] then judgment will come
[1:37:52] not sure if anyone else has something to
[1:37:54] say
[1:37:58] one point i got a question for brother
[1:37:59] abe no problem
[1:38:14] and if his people don't unite
[1:38:19] how does he unite them
[1:38:21] give us an example
[1:38:26] well
[1:38:42] oh right
[1:38:44] um
[1:38:46] i'll just read the quote
[1:38:50] this will answer that question is that
[1:38:52] right brother ben yes sir
[1:38:56] responded
[1:39:10] and he says
[1:39:12] oh the spirit of god just moving through
[1:39:15] me now
[1:39:19] you're saying something
[1:39:22] i don't know how to say it you know
[1:39:34] two
[1:39:36] thousand
[1:39:37] two thousand hundred thousand demons
[1:39:43] turned loose upon upon those jews
[1:39:48] when they burned them
[1:39:51] they crucified them
[1:40:05] and they shot them
[1:40:10] until they had no more bullets to shoot
[1:40:12] them with pasta
[1:40:16] and they'd done everything they could do
[1:40:20] they
[1:41:02] what a tremendous when i saw that code
[1:41:05] it was
[1:41:06] you know because many times we
[1:41:08] god gives us opportunity after
[1:41:10] opportunity
[1:41:13] and many times we we reject
[1:41:15] opportunities
[1:41:43] you know we see a service like sunday
[1:41:46] domingo by church
[1:41:48] wow if that wasn't if that wasn't a cry
[1:41:51] too
[1:41:52] to bring us back home
[1:41:56] many times it's easy to to fall under
[1:41:59] the spirit of the day
[1:42:02] spiritual relaxed many times
[1:42:06] we're cold
[1:42:08] we have need of nothing
[1:42:11] when god is slapping us on the face
[1:42:15] [Music]
[1:42:16] it's time to go home
[1:42:19] it's time to unite
[1:42:21] time to get right with god
[1:42:24] but what is it going to take
[1:42:27] the prophet god says look to russia and
[1:42:29] prophet
[1:42:30] he says
[1:42:31] you got to watch russia
[1:42:34] but he's cr he screamed and he cried
[1:42:38] he saw this day in this hour is
[1:42:42] he knew that we were going to reject him
[1:42:46] that's why he preached the message
[1:42:48] he says there'll come a time
[1:42:51] when they reject and they crucify him
[1:43:05] it's clear right before our eyes
[1:43:38] and we can't live the same anymore
[1:43:42] is that one opportunity
[1:43:45] and i believe that's what these these
[1:43:47] teachings have done to me
[1:43:53] from inside to open and to cry and to
[1:43:56] want to know more about what he's doing
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:05] what a blessing that god has put in our
[1:44:07] midst
[1:44:11] god bless you
[1:44:14] thank you all for your attention
