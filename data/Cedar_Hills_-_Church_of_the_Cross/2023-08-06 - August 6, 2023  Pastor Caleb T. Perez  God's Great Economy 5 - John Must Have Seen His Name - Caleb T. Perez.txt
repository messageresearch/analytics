[Music] foreign [Music] here [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] God bless you [Music] oh [Music] for more [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] again [Music] me and my God [Music] oh goodness [Music] baby or more important [Music] tonight [Music] your foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my goodness [Music] Spider-Man [Music] [Applause] and I believe that this 70 weeks of Daniel will bring it to our understanding now there was Daniel was concerned about his people because he had read Jeremiah the prophet and understood that Jeremiah had said that they would be in captivity for 70 years and then he seen men they'd already been in captivity for 68 years so he knew the time was at hand so he set aside all of his work hold out as it was the shades of all these daily tasks that he spaced the God put on sackcalls and Ashes and went to fasting and praying that he might understand when that time would be amen then we find as I have stated before now now let's outline Daniel 70 of weeks now I might repeat here again Ministers of the Gospel you disagree with this all right they are divided in three periods as we find out in Daniel 9. three periods first a seven week period then a three score and two which is 62 and then a one week period they're divided in three different periods now we know about all the Gospels that Paul called and the others that God will return again to the Jew well then if he's going to return again to the Jew how can we apply it back in Daniel's time we've got to apply it in this last age and it's after the Gentile church has been gone [Music] because he deals with Israel as a nation we as an individual now I've got some variety here that I'd like to read to you as we go by now the going forth of the Commandment to reveal Jerusalem which was on the 14th day of March if any of you want to put that down in the Hebrew your final call n-i-s-a-n Dyson which means March the issue was given on the 14th day of March BC 445. the issue went forth the bills revealed the temple you understand it as you people have read the scriptures until it was completed it taken 49 years to complete the temple and the city to rebuild it and as the Bible said you're Daniel speaking or the angel too Daniel that the walls that it would be building Troublesome times many of us remember when there was filthy had a mortar Block in one hand and a sword in the other to watch the enemy and it would be built in Troublesome times so here is where I find that that's getting my days now we got two three different calendars we go back to the old astronomy calendar and we find out that in the Julian calendar there is 365 and one fourth day in a year they time that for the passing of stars the different stars and so forth they time now we find in the Roman Calendar that we live under now 365 days in a year by the calendar but in the Christian or prophetic calendar we find there's only 360 days in a year this last days is when gonna reveal these secrets to the church he hasn't done it before and the reason he hasn't done it is to keep the Church of watching and praying all the time and not knowing when it was coming but remember in Daniel 12 he said the wire shall understand in the last day it's been given to him the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make no one to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bring in the church in and revealing what data we're living in just the same as Gabriel come to to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great secret things do you understand now we have 30 days in some months 30 ones the next 28 and some see we're all messed up but God don't have it back and forth he hits an exactly the same yes sir exclusive 30 days in a month not 31 then 30 something else now if there was seven look there's exactly 49 days 49 years brother in the time of the building of the temple the seven are seven prophetic weeks seven weeks closer seven weeks determined to the temple to rebuild the Temple so what do we get what do we get or if seven weeks means 49 years and one week equals seven years and seven times seven Forty Nine amen exactly there you are so now there's no more guessing about it we know now that each week mid seven years now we are told from the going forth of the Commandment now we are told from the going forth of the Commandment to reveal the city to Messiah and Messiah was Christ of course shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks making 69 weeks see all right and seven times 69 makes 483 years are you getting it down if you want me to run over it again I'll be glad to do it now from the going forth of the Commandment to rebuild Jerusalem was determine seven weeks which means 49 years and 49 years hit it exactly well from the refilling on the table to the Messiah was 438 years old 400 and 434 years and 434 times 49 makes exactly 483 years it hit it on the nose exactly [Music] there you are now we come down to we are positive sure that coming through the the Jewish stage we got them 69 weeks at exactly about history by the calendar by God's prophetic here bringing the history of the prophetic calendar from the Old Testament over to the new and shown it's exactly the same where will that set this week begins exactly after this church is cut off then God returns to the Jews I remember when to juice was returning back to them Jews down in the other nations and the look magazine give the article of it I read it clippy from some paper some religious magazine then one day of them planes going down there to pick up these shoes way down in Iran it's an optical World they were to scattered down now that's a true Jews salmon ever had an opportunity ah brother there's your 144 thousand when we get to Revelation 7 you'll see it he said there's 12 times again 12 times the base you're 12 Tribes of Reuben 12 times and where were they all standing on Mount Sinai Jews back in the Homeland there they were they were the ones that wasn't this Wall Street crooked bunch Noster it was the real Jews and when this old Rabbi stood out there and seen this plane land them Jews you read in the magazine they were still piled wooden clouds now when they seen that thing sitting out there they were born little rabbis stood out there instead of our conferences and when we go back to our homeland we'll be carried back on the wings of an eagle it's time that God's gonna allow those Jews to start dealing with them again I cannot test it I don't know nobody knows that but listen if Israel is already in her Homeland already all the Rocks is picked up the irrigation the waters and everything that God promised they found Wells and things are big overstreams that's the most beautiful place you ever seen they got a City built there they got irrigation they got the best Land There is the world there and we find out about the Dead Sea there's more chemicals enough to buy the world see now and in the middle of the week the middle of this Jewish week see that's three and a half years the Antichrist the prince of Prince that is the cow and remember he comes out of Rome the prince that is to come what is he a pulse this Beast this Prince that shall scatter the power of the Holy people what will they do he'll break his Covenant with them after three and a half years you'll oust them how people think that's common isn't it that just calls you the spirit of God has dealt with you it's not communism it's religion the Bible said it'd be so closer to see the very elected so he were in the lake now these two prophets what will they do it's Moses and Elijah amen so rise on the scene they'll tell those user mistakes and out of that Jewish box is there now to be the 144 000 God will call for these Prophets what is it the spirit of Elijah of this Gentile church will just continue right on into that future call Moses with him gender Hallelujah you see it and he'll preach the same message of Pentecostal those Jews that they rejection the Messiah amen you see it but remember that's over in the 70s weekend the churches in glory amen the wedding supper's going on [Music] Pentecostal Prophets sir the spikes here now Jewish and romanism that is the sleeping virgin shall consolidate themselves together in the form of the Federation churches and it will be like Jesus said in Matthew 24 and from Revelations 13 14. thank you now if we know beyond any Shadow about who that Beast was that power that had the deadly wound that didn't live it was when Pagan Rome was killed in papyrone took its place when Pagan power was killed in Tampa power took its place there's not

this morning we greet you in Jesus the name of the Lord Jesus Christ read all those that are online you're in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can you just maybe at that at that camera over there and just just wave to it well hold on a second let them move that camera because all right there you go greet the people online they you know we were we were with brother IRA and sister Carol last Sunday and the brother Ira was saying he said are you all really here to to we were just as happy to be there with them and of course they said to greet each and every one of you and he said especially brother Henry and sister Moana they've been through here a few quite a few times and they've always it's the time to stop with us and we appreciate that is also able to be there with with a co-family La Familia brother Jerry Cole senior senor it was good to see the family meet some of the people I had never heard about but I had never seen before may God continue to bless them and sister Ramona and and the family amen we we uh we were able to to uh maybe see it just for a moment but we were able to uh on on Wednesday El mercolis we were able to have a zoom conference with with the with some pastors the pastors there in Uganda Uganda grateful to the Tommy brother Jimmy and brother Abraham who were here it's not a wonderful time just a wonderful time in speaking about the Lord message and we then went into a few more different subjects but but I want to read to you just excerpt of of one of the texts that one of the pastors wrote says I'm here to say thanks for the mentorship that you all are giving us the fact is that I'm not only a pastor but also a a Bible teacher at University level by qualification but I've realized that I have a lot more to learn from you all the better fact is that I have realized that I don't know the Bible as I thought yeah meaning that I have been giving God's people a poisoned gospel significance I only request if possible to continue to attend these Bible study classes so that I can learn more I can help change the flock and I pray for a blessing to all God's people who have sold a seed in this kind of ministry the good lord always stays succeeded here very grateful to God or his word is just as alive today would you stand now as as we read the word this will be God's Great economy number five and I want to put a subtitle to this John must have seen his can I can I get you to repeat that after me John must have seen his name what a thing it is my question to you is how many of you have seen your name all right good it's a good question all right well let's get into it God bless the visitors that are here and I saw Mr Chelsea back there somewhere didn't I God bless you Sister good to have you here back home amen let's turn in our bibles if we would to the book of Saint Luke the 10th chapter and the 20th verse Lucas I don't know why I'm so dry this morning but Lord help us and it reads like this when you have you can say Amen let's start with verse 19. hold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you yeah now we know the back story of this is that the disciples come and they're excited right they returned to the Lord and say even the devils are subject unto us excited you pray for somebody and they get healed and you're like wow the only problem is sometimes then we pray for someone else and then if we don't see the same results and we're like what happened so here they come and this is what Jesus is saying but but right away the Lord he turns their attention to something far greater and he says in verse 20. notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven is but brother Abraham was speaking about last Sunday right our names written in the stars because your names are written in heaven that's what we should Rejoice about the answer is I want to know how many of you have rejoiced about that the disciples maybe didn't fully understand at the time what Jesus was saying they knew it was something to be happy about but there was something about the name or the word Rejoice that that they didn't quite get ourselves watch verse 21 now in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit for years and years and centuries and he says he rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that's thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight yes amen may God add His blessings to the reading of his word and you may be seated what would change in your life if you knew beyond a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a doubt but when we understand what Jesus was really he said because our names were not written the the day we were baptized the name names were written before the foundation of the world you only recognize that your name was there that day that's what we want to know today he is looking I don't know how many of you would want to know that and be able to can you imagine the life we could live a doubt that our names are there imagine the worship that that we would we would put forth when we came to church the worship we could display at work or at school or everywhere we were at when Los trabajos imagine the kind people we would be knew for sure that our names were written there is but he didn't see it when Jesus said your name is written in heaven years later till John saw his name want to get ahead of ourselves but that's where we're going senior name written somewhere can be so satisfying if it's a good thing foreign not always a good thing to see your name it can be terrifying if it's for something that's not good well yes in life there are so many so many times that we have had to look on some sort of a list to find our name is looking at a list for your name is remember in elementary that was when snakes were still standing upright I remember that was that was a few years back and we would go to school and and of course we had in our mind which teacher we wanted right first thing we would do they would have a list at the entrance of the class everybody who is going to be with this teacher Maestro and we'll go right away to the class that we wanted to go we're looking um what a bummer go to the other one yeah there I am yeah then we wouldn't and after we would look at look for our name is then we try to console ourselves let's see who else is with me okay friends we're always looking for names right and we go through life looking or our name you see our names are attached to so many things in life so many things both good and bad that's the hard thing yes Maybe our name is attached to a church think about that right there are people in a denominational realm but you have to sign your name on the book and you are part of that church oh that church oh yeah I go to that church your name is maybe your name is attached to a high school diploma or a college degree it's good it shows some accomplishments right okay maybe your name is attached to a business license the business that you opened up or maybe to a driver's license uh or a marriage certificate even your children's birth certificate your name is attached to a lot of things but then maybe your name was attached to crime that happened a court case or or an unpaid debt on Casino maybe your name is connected with a family that didn't have a good reputation maybe your name is not worth much because of your past okay and sometimes things in our name that our names are attached to because and yet there are things or places or sites that we shouldn't have been to yeah that we did it to ourselves hello everybody hola that's why I was singing the song Jesus name thank God for the name of Jesus so do you know that every place and everything and everyone your name has been attached to and this is every website social oh you better not go there right away and we say you know I erased my name though I hated it but one thing that you cannot delete on your own is that the recording Angel has recorded it off and he knows every place and everything and every person that your name is are you okay everybody okay trying to reach you here is that a good little Foundation here this is why we're not why we're not sure many times whether we're saved or not this is why we're not sure whether our name is there on that book or not because of all the things we know our name is this is why our names are attached to many things that we are not proud of muchas but there is as I said one name that is the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that's why Jesus said notwithstanding in this Rejoice not because the the spirits that they're subject to you but can you voice because your names are written in heaven is the love that would be shared by Jesus Christ the only thing that can erase or remove your name from all the things sin all the things that are of this world it's the only thing that could erase your name is the blood of Jesus things that we said things that we have done things that we have thought the recording Angel has recorded and that's why Jesus said Rejoice because your names are written in heaven now the only way that you can truly rejoice is that right amen I'm gonna say it again you have to see it written I mean yeah it's good if somebody says believe your name's there brother buddy believe your name's there I believe you my name's there I believe your name's there we say Amen to that and he can rejoice and say yes but the level of rejoicing would be so much greater when he sees his name [Applause] I'm feeling good right now once again when you see your name the rejoicing is so much greater we're going to get into why I'm saying these things I don't believe that that these disciples rejoiced on the level that Jesus rejoices because your names are written verses Jesus then rejoiced in spirit happy hourly you don't know what it is to really Rejoice finally see your name is just rejoice in your flesh knowing that your name was put on that book before the foundation of the world was ever laid and so it is with us yes yes because our minds are constantly telling us that we're not good enough how many people are truthful here at one point or another has your mind says you're not good enough I'm going to raise both of my hands Manos I could raise my feet I'd raised minds are always telling us you're not good enough it's impossible for your name to be there yeah we have to deal with these kind of things but I can see John meditating about this about that statement John begins to think about it my name written so John would do something that no other person no other disciple would do what was it yes he would lay on the bosom of Jesus Jesus and he could hear the heart Jesus was the very Heart Of God Jesus he could hear that heartbeat and that never would leave him watch why I'm saying this now he meditated Rejoice because my name is there my name's written I believe it is I I went to look at for the word reason and the word is is Cairo and the word means to be cheerful it's a source of pleasure or happiness but this is where I'm going today it also means a salutation on meeting Godspeed foreign [Applause] when's the last time you walked into a room and people got excited into a room and somebody was rejoicing yeah they come is the truth is I love it that yeah see what she's wearing okay that's not rejoicing a Son of God also wants his brother and sister to be on that list that's why it wasn't just finding my name is I want every one of you to make it okay I'm gonna be there without any one of you that's why we struggle and we preach and we cry and we do all that you do what to bring you in I don't want to be in heaven without any Rejoice because your names are written they're getting my thought now get beard a little bit and that's what Jesus is telling them rejoice is telling them yes men will revile you Lord men will persecute you and say all manner of evil again falsely for my sake but you're about to welcome Benida I'm going to say that again when everyone is speaking bad about because of Christ you were messing up right not because you were Orlando oh because you're talking more a little too much and when people they falsely accuse you and when people revile yeah that's the perfect time to Rejoice because you're about to say goodbye to something I'll go to something else rejoice in this house he gave them something and showed them what they were going to Rejoice about John of Patmos not just because of what who he was but he was there because of the destiny of Jesus Christ say it again sometimes we want everything to go just perfect and go good all the time welcoming anything but when you're on the idol of Batman when you have to be straight and you seem to be all alone that's the perfect time listen to this in the fourth still brother Brown says that's the reason I think John was doing a lot of shouting together oh finally but Jesus had told him about the revelation of Jesus Christ is coming brother must have seen his name there he says starting to Rejoice the way that Jesus Rejoice come on now how many of you want to Rejoice the way that Jesus rejoice you want to Rejoice you got to get into the spirit first all right look at your neighbor notice this watch oh this as this unfolds says he must have seen his name there capital T there IG and then he says you see and then he says again he's asking us twice do you understand and then he says again because c means to understand and then he says again if you understand yes brother Brahms telling us that is do you understand do you all understand it do you understand how he saw his name there ah let's go on no notice this now you're going from a partial realization to a perfect realization because in a partial realization you're believing I believe okay partial with the partial realization I haven't seen anything I believe he's called me I believe in unto this it's a partial realization we're looking to get to a perfect realization because under a perfect realization when we see our names I don't know how many of you really are interested in this um we really want to see our name is let's find out goes on he says in the force and God talking to Elijah is Elijah said there's no one else and he says I'm going to open up one of the Stills it is he said you know I got 700 back there that ain't never bowed their knee yeah they've never joined any Creed or denominations oh brother my name was attached to a denomination but when he said come out of her my people moved your name from there he said there's 700 of them ready he said Prophet who Reveals His word I have 700 prepared names that have not bowed their knees might say it in this day I've got 700 that have never bowed to religious organizations I like what he says I have 700 preparedness do you believe that your name is one of those prepared come on now you don't sound like you're rejoicing this morning because if it's just a hope that's not going to Rejoice on that level because how many of you believe your name is or do you really know that your name is this is where the enemy plays with us plays with our minds this one did this oh yes cares about all that that has nothing to do with your name being there if it was there and you knew it is Amber but it causes so much problems these names that were prepared he has them in a special place he's got him in a special place they're not with the rest of the list you'll understand in a minute so what started the hunt is the hunt for what for the names he's hunting this morning for the names that have been prepared foreign at least candle let's see what he says the message is the faith of Abraham we are called of God no man can come to me except my father draws him first then it isn't man seeking God God seeking man and then our name is on the book The Bible said since the foundation of the world and the holy spirit's here prepared names um what's the Revelation the realities there was no symbol yes they would give away the secret foreign the prepared name los nombres preparados let me ask you a question when were the names put on the Lamb's Book of Life cuando foreign but in a message called the mark of the beast yeah brother Brown says this is and when you're born again your name is put on the Lamb's Book of Life we're in a good pickle this morning and this is where the carnal believer this is when the car where the carnal person gets stuck and says there's mistakes in the message over here before the foundation of the world and then over here says no no he says he said it's when you're born again is when your name was put on this is so do you what do we do say well I'm going to choose this one or this one here's the answer to it's very simple in the message he goes on he says the Bible said he was slain before the foundation of the world but it taken 4 000 years oh okay when was your name put on the Lamb's Book of Life but it has taken 16 years it's self-explanatory the message says watch this how important it is you are born again and he calls being born again they are remarried again there's there's your new birth remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in at the beginning now he's hunting for you the germ of life from the beginning oh you're gonna get to rejoice so we're going to get to some good stuff now watch this now this is so so wonderful God's word now your old books is gone yes everything your name was attached to that it shouldn't have been you're old now your name has been transferred oh we're gonna get to something good but you gotta get all these little points now your name has been transferred when was the transformation before the watch this now do you mean to tell me that my old book is in the sea of forgetfulness now your name is what a word the new book Nuevo not the Book of Life we're going to get to something good on that not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural Union your marriage certificate matrimonial I'm gonna say it again the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate right that's the Book of Life your marriage certificate matrimonial did you get a marriage certificate brother Enzo recipes your name's on there right so numbers good job okay sure her name and his name where your Eternal germ on this from the beginning here's the rejoicing now come on you got to get in the spirit now here's the rejoicing Rejoice is a salutation a welcoming of something because the devils are subject to you it's always because your name is in other words you're saying good to something you're saying hello to something else we welcome our new life we say goodbye to the old nature is trying to make this as simple as possible questions and answers only those whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life Mysterio and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name I want to see my name there says look through this you find in the Bible you're going to find somebody you can identify with Joshua I guess I'll change my name to Joshua you're missing watch what he says here because he look at this the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling your name when the book is open the Mystery Begins to be unfolded whosoever will let him and when we hear the word whosoever will yeah the name is what was that who was that he's calling your name he's revealing the mystery watch watch how this unfolds here let's let's continue he said well it's called that you finally understand that now understand the book doesn't say Lee Vale or Kayla Perez will be saved in the last Church so we're looking for something what are you looking for okay oh doesn't say it like that no it don't say that no no they say so it just shows the mystery Mysterio it unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by faith how many believe it this morning we are stopped by faith we believe it and then God himself become a man Jesus Jesus and came down the same way the lowest pits of Hell Allah picked out until we see him and within his likeness is Heavens was rolled as that was the protection is that right there when he rolled it up fill it up say yellow still those things say yes there's a person that needs to happen that's great book and I'm going to use this example where's our local I believe it's the Bible this great book is the grand Libro was closed Revelations it was in the hand no we got to go back and we we've heard this time and time again Adam had eternal life he forfeited his rights right to save his wife and daddy life went back to the original owner in other words that life that he had to go back to the original owner or the original Giver of the original owner everybody get that it's not very needful for where we're going is in the hand of the original owner which is on your hand the lamb then goes and takes the book and transfer and it's transferred at that moment to the angel now now this is where people get confused how can Jesus be God he runs over here then he takes the book something's not right nobody ever think that am I the only one thinking that yes that he's the son of God it goes and he takes the book right this is important to understand your name is we can preach a nice little message and it's just skim milk with a little bottles this is me now see those white things coming out of your gums it's not just to polish a moment up and make him look pretty you know nobody cares about their teeth in the whole world like like the United States does Dennis all the time pretty smile right we put a lot of time and effort into teeth we should yeah how many believe the lamb is Jesus Christ this is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world go and take the book how is he taking it we're going to find this out now number one is where is he understand he he ascended to the office of fathers and he sends back his Spirit to the church the Bible says you receive not the spirit of the father of the sun now what he said oh power in heaven and in Earth it has been given to him when he goes back to the father he leaves the office of the sun vacancies waiting for someone aim that he has prepared a man that he can incarnate him that can go and take the book not the man it is it was not just a man that preached the Seven Seals no no it's closed in Revelations chapter 5. when the lamb takes the book now it's open in the hand of the angel in Revelations 10. the angel has the little book in his hand and it's open and that means that the Revelation is not closer come on are you with me when the book is open now when it's closed the revelations close watch this now but now it's open and now where is the book come on you want to know whether your name's there or not yes you ain't gonna get it any other way I'm gonna say it again now where is the book The Lamb had it it's in the hand of the Angels now where is it in the hand of the angels He was not the only son come to an adoption there were prepared names the hell that would take the book and read the book where's the book now is my name in the book my name is Revelations 10 9. the angel and I said give me up eat it up well I heard this message of brother Branham I really didn't like it he really just hit me hard and then I heard this other message I don't know if it's true or not you'll never know of your name is I don't question I know people that'll question everything yo said yeah there's a lot of things I don't understand believe it is John Juan and John is a type of the Bride John took the book means you and I took this ticket when we take the book we must start to Rejoice but you're gonna Rejoice but Heaven came down and Glory filled my soul is Libro oh brother Tommy took the book and he ate it off what will you do with Jesus on your hands what do we do with the little book yes I'm a message believer tell everybody what are you doing hello everybody what are we doing with it on our Shelf yeah it stays in book forms no more not like that you understand foreign we can't help it but we prophesy everywhere we go we prophesy not everybody has this book only the bride when we prophesy remember where it tells us to go to Norway yes go to South America go to Mexico whatever you want Lord oh you have the open book we have not closed I don't know if my name is because it's the mystery of the book well he's calling oh my goodness but in the days of the voice of the seven days when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared it to his servants the prophets how do we know then that we have the books this is the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed it's the manifested Christ in you yes the hope of glory that great manifested God in Christ now Christ is manifested in you look meeting this is Brother Brown come on but was once God's Great secret located his great mysterious Secret in his mind his great mysterious secret that was in his mind Einstein said Einstein I don't get this but one thing I'm gonna use the rest of my life if I want to know what God was thinking when he did all this come on now come on how many of you want to know what's in God's mind great mysterious Mysteries that were in God's Minds oh my Lord show me your mind Lord I want to see your mind why aren't you aren't you hearing your hearings in his mind foreign I'm going to make sure that you get this today how will you know then that's where he placed it that is the body of Christ once God's Great Secret in his mind foundation of the world has materialized oh how many got that but there's no cut that on you notice what he says here it's written and then we say wait a minute it's written somewhere I thought it wasn't right oh is it rain or not this is our founding Pastor is quoting brother Branham he says one day you'll find out where it was that's a revelation that's got a chunk of meat right there better get in there and start ripping that meat up and then our pastor asked you're with me I don't know maybe that doesn't mean much to you he's asking the question is you're with me I am I see my name come on people he says don't keep saying in the resurrection we're going to know it all right everything is tomorrow but if we have resurrected spiritually it says then it happens today we're waiting for tomorrow it happens today for somebody here today one person catches the revelations it happens today as in the days of provocation tomorrow is too late if today you hear his voice oh yes what are you hearing in the days of the voice of the seventh angels when he should begin to sound once again the book holds that mystery and the book is that the only unfolding it now so then when you take the book and eat all of it you begin to see the mystery material lies in your life while your name is I had never seen The Book of Life and the Lamb's Book of Life like this I tell you what it rocked my world you understand we shouldn't The Book of Life and last book of life one book or two help me out here somebody help me one there's times brother Branham says he says there's two there we go again how many books there's the Book of Genesis in here Exodus exodo Leviticus there's the Old Testament and the new testamento yes okay kind of get this picture this just rocks my world when Adam sinned that part of eternal life went from Adam where did it go I want this if we just said that it goes back to the original owner which was God now now get this good now it went back to God The Giver says or back to the Book of Life it's gonna rock your world if you're spiritual rock your world if not then you don't care about these things it went back to God The Giver it went back to the Book of Life foreign because sometimes we look at the book of life and the last book oh I I want to be the noun Book of Life watch this now we can see this is getting heavy Genesis why then would he say it went back to God the Book of Life because all life comes from God there's no life without God and His will was that nobody would perish I don't want no one to perish that he didn't create hell for us he don't want no none of us to parents watch this now it goes back on the Book of Life it went back on that side just imagine it left Adam and it goes back it was back to the original one this is a Chasm we're coming around the corner there's a Chasm here so that it could not return back over here because the blood of bulls and goats no way of getting back that what Adam had lost this is all the part of the Plan of Redemption it could not come back across the chasm foreign [Music] he's building a bridge or a bridge to connect God and man again we're coming to the end now come on now stay with me now he building a bridge that way we didn't have to stay on this side anymore we could go to the other side that's the bridge you see that's the book of life that Holy Spirit and unless Jesus left the Holy Spirit could not come back why Jesus said that comforter cannot come there's no Comfort you'll never know if your name was on there but if he went away [Applause] el padre whoo I don't know I'm rejoicing right now if I start getting stumbling around it's just getting a little hot up here I invite you to come right now come and join in with this this with me he sees the father he sees the book The Book of Life foreign to get that book or those names and transfer them oh church church you gotta get this I'm gonna say it again now he overcame his life on the cross to have the authority the power confidence take this book that was on the hand of the or that was closed in the hand of the father and to flip it open you will get through the names that he was going to redeem he did not die for every name that was in the in the lamb or in the Book of Life die for all the names [Music] goodbye pleasures of sins made up my mind is oh God's way the rest of my life he has the right to get that life and transfer it to the lamb becomes the revelation of Jesus Christ I'm gonna say that again he transfers it to the lamps the revelation of Jesus Christ you might say brother how can you say that this is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ but the lamb that took because it was oh now we're getting into the nitty-gritty I'm sorry I gotta put myself together here a little bit I love his word watch this now the book of life now the revelation of Jesus Christ being the revelation of Jesus Christ then that become Lamb's Book of Life who is The Book of Life but now we have been transferred where is the Lamb oh come on I'm gonna say it again where is the lamb in the bride the lamb had overcome he went to the father and he says I overcame I can take it now yo yeah watch this now the Lamb's Book of Life of the name that was elected were written in that book foreign foreign Revelations 5 6. revelation I be held in low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a immediated Jesus is not a lamb yes but the revelation of the Lamb the revelation of Jesus Christ and it's not just one thing it is an organism it is his body here on Earth this is now who it is as it had been slain Jesus was not as he had been slain he was slain but this lamb as it had been slain Jesus now you're seeing the complete revelation of Jesus Christ having seven it's okay the seven Church ages and seven eyes which are the seven spirits or the seven Messengers now we're not just seeing a lamb by itself I've seen everything that makes up the lamb what is the whole revelation of Jesus Christ material Rising here on Earth has been materializing and don't finishes up everything up oh my goodness my time has gone I just want to hit just a couple of more things he didn't die for the whole world died for those names that were in so he has to change Tabernacles he says to me it's easy what I mean he says fussy you have to change Tabernacles because the Tabernacle that he lived in had to die but it was different than the little lamb first Covenant because this land Jesus Christ died and had a life inside of him different from the little lamb difference could come back in another Tabernacles again oh Church there's the revelation of it it has to be something better in you coming to church and jumping and shouting that won't do it no that's not gonna do it it's got to be inside of you not to be read to you you've got to accept what the last will and testament has for you that you're called by God to receive it and if your name isn't on that television is foreign who was protecting the rights a god-sent group of people um I'm going to say it again a god-sent group of people that we can be part of that group people don't get it they want to look and say oh that's the lamb Jesus Christ 2000 years ago and they don't see a change Tabernacles Galatians 4 14. I'm coming to an end now in about 30 minutes Drop It come on Galatians 4 14. and my Temptation which was in my flesh he despised not the justice here's the Revelation but you received me as a name to most people that's not hard how was the messenger they received him as an Angel watch the continuation of the Revelation you receive me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus Christ Jesus oh there there there's the revelation of it all if you can't see the changing of the of the Mask there was Christ Paul in the First Church of Jesus Christ how different my difference yes we see that came on the scene Jesus where's the lamb don't this where is Christopher who receive me as Christ Jesus they say that you're some say you're Jesus Christ are you Jesus Christ if you try to make me the person of Jesus Jesus if you try to make me the person of Jesus Christ you're making me an Antiques but if you say that Christ lives in me no work to me receiving me as Christ Jesus watch this now as we turn the turn another Corner the Revelation now Revelation has unfolded it's not it is not hidden no more Christ in you makes him the center of life la vida Center of life of the Revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in The Bible History makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ in you makes you a second the complete revelation of the whole thing that's the complete revelation of redemption what is the new birth then a revelation of Joyce personally to you still the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you is this to anybody I I don't hear nobody Rejoice it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you [Applause] yeah this is what Paul was trying to get to them get out of your mind that you can never be lost come on Church come on we gotta get to that peace get it out of our minds that we can ever be lost we can no more be lost than God can be lost we can no more die than God can die William Branham William Branham you are to be the end time message as a mystery as the name is hello what's your name there it's the mystery what's your mystery when you talk like that you've never seen your name the brother thinks whoever he is I could go off on another one I'm finishing terminal is the bride then the only ones that have life at the time up to up to the great white Throne judgment yes try to find life she came already with life I hope you get this that bride didn't come and say well Lord hope the Lord pray the Lord gives me life that life was on every single name because their name was already wrapped up but everyone else when the books are opened and there are many that will receive life virgins and those that were good to the bride and so forth that's when they will receive life but here we are at the end what a revelation the open door what was the open door revelation of the Supreme deity not being a second person of the Trinity but being God himself made flesh and dwelling amongst us and for the first time the name has that was spoken and now come back Luther had a name that lived but he was dead still using fathers and holy ghosts here comes the name again the revelation of the Supreme deity brother will would you come so I can finish here if not I don't know when to stop you with me yeah I'm going to finish it because he taught so much and this just gets yes it was so mindful of us oh mindful of you idios that he used titles better but again the greatest thing one of the greatest he did for us and he's known through the scriptures and I go through him with you now this is my I'm just going to
