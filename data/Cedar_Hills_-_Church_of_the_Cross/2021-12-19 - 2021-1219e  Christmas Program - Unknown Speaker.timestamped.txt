[19:32] trees
[19:34] oh yeah yeah i think i know this one
[19:37] the three little trees
[19:40] well let me tell you what happened long
[19:43] long long long long ago
[19:49] on a high hilltop overlooking the city
[19:52] of bethlehem
[19:53] was three
[19:54] trees
[19:56] not one
[19:58] not two
[20:00] but three trees
[20:13] how many trees do you see
[20:16] okay very well then let's continue with
[20:18] our story no interruptions please
[20:21] now these trees weren't just ordinary
[20:23] trees
[20:24] they were planted for a purpose
[20:26] far beyond their understanding
[20:29] there was a greater purpose for these
[20:31] trees
[20:32] god had these trees planted in this
[20:34] exact spot for a special reason
[20:37] but of course
[20:38] just like human beings
[20:40] they sometimes spend way too much time
[20:43] dreaming about the things that they
[20:45] wanted to be
[20:46] and where they thought they wanted their
[20:48] life to go
[20:55] they just like my dreams
[20:58] oh i know exactly what i want to be
[21:02] at us
[21:03] atlas what do you want to be i want to
[21:05] be cut down
[21:07] be made into a treasure box just like
[21:09] this one right here it's nice on
[21:13] where i hold all the gold and jewels and
[21:16] shiny stuff and all the riches of the
[21:18] king be filled with diamonds
[21:20] so many rubies and tons of gold
[21:24] i hold the most priceless treasures
[21:28] ever it will be the greatest treasure
[21:31] box any human will lay its eyes on
[21:36] oh
[21:36] that's that's good that's some good
[21:38] stuff
[21:40] very fancy
[21:42] i'll be the most beautiful treasure
[21:43] chest in the world
[21:45] you know that that sounds all grand and
[21:48] great but
[21:49] you know me i'm better than you
[21:52] so
[21:53] i have a bigger dream
[21:56] oh really once i get cut down i'll be
[22:00] turned into the greatest ship the world
[22:02] has ever seen
[22:04] kings and queens across the ocean
[22:07] imagine me as a mighty large ship
[22:10] all the other ships from all the coasts
[22:12] will be so jealous
[22:14] of my beauty
[22:16] and to think only the finest of fine
[22:19] will ride on my ship
[22:21] the best
[22:23] whoa
[22:24] that is a dream what a dream
[22:28] well i mean
[22:30] your dreams are all great and all but
[22:32] i'm just sitting here thinking to myself
[22:34] why would you want to be cut down
[22:36] i mean the purpose of a tree is to not
[22:39] be cut down
[22:41] my dream is way better than both of
[22:43] yours put together
[22:45] you see
[22:46] all never be cut down
[22:48] i'll be the highest tree in the land
[22:52] and i'll grow and grow
[22:55] and i'll tower all the other trees that
[22:57] ever existed
[22:58] all the people will always look to me as
[23:01] the years and generations go by
[23:04] i'll stand on this mountain
[23:06] right here
[23:07] and when people see these big huge
[23:09] branches
[23:10] they'll raise their eyes towards heaven
[23:13] and they'll think
[23:14] of
[23:15] god
[23:25] so one day
[23:27] a woodcutter climbed a high mountain
[23:32] as the woodcutter looked for a tree
[23:35] he found tree number one
[23:37] this tree is perfect for me said the
[23:39] woodcutter
[23:41] so with a swoosh of his axe the first
[23:43] tree fell to the ground
[23:55] then the next day
[23:56] as the woodcutter was looking for
[23:58] another tree
[23:59] he found tree number two
[24:02] this looks like a strong tree he thought
[24:04] it's perfect for me
[24:06] and with one swoosh of his axe
[24:11] oh oh i'm finally getting cut down but
[24:13] it kind of hurts
[24:16] the second tumbling down
[24:21] and it rolled down the cliff
[24:26] then the next day
[24:30] the third woodcutter looked again for
[24:33] another tree
[24:34] i don't need anything special today he
[24:36] thought any tree will do
[24:39] and with a swing of his axe
[24:41] the third tree hit the ground
[24:46] oh man
[24:47] about the third tree
[24:49] what's gonna be of my dreams now my goal
[24:52] is to never be cut down let's get going
[24:54] come on boy
[24:56] no
[24:59] i didn't want to be cut down
[25:02] that wasn't my dream
[25:05] and there the three trees got taken away
[25:09] so the first tree was cut up
[25:12] and made
[25:13] into a feed box for animals
[25:16] the once beautiful tree was not covered
[25:18] with gold
[25:19] and with no treasure was it placed
[25:22] but instead
[25:23] put in a stable and filled with hay
[25:28] now the second tree was taken down to a
[25:30] seashore
[25:32] but no mighty ship was made that day
[25:35] instead the once mighty tree was made
[25:37] into a simple fishing
[25:40] boat and the third tree
[25:47] was cut into two large beams
[25:50] with no real use for it yet
[25:52] and was just left in a lumber yard wow
[25:58] so
[25:59] the years went by
[26:01] but the trees had not forgotten their
[26:02] dreams
[26:04] and god's plan for them was about to
[26:06] unfold
[26:08] one night a golden star from the heavens
[26:11] above shined into a stable
[26:14] and there a young girl placed her baby
[26:15] boy to be born in the manger wow
[26:19] into that feed box that was made of the
[26:21] first tree
[26:22] her husband joseph wished he could have
[26:24] made a for the newborn child
[26:26] but this box would do just fine
[26:30] suddenly the first tree realized
[26:32] something important
[26:33] he was now holding the greatest treasure
[26:36] of all time
[26:38] far beyond anyone had ever seen
[26:42] the first tree's heart was so full of
[26:44] joy for the savior of the world had come
[26:46] down as a little baby and he was chosen
[26:49] to hold jesus
[26:55] years later
[26:56] a group of men climbed into a fishing
[26:59] boat
[27:00] that was made from the second tree
[27:02] one of the men got very tired that night
[27:06] and he fell asleep
[27:08] while they were out on the water a great
[27:10] storm arose
[27:12] some of the men were so afraid that the
[27:14] ship would sink
[27:15] they went and woke the sleeping man
[27:18] the man stood up on the boat
[27:20] stretched forth his little hand and he
[27:22] said
[27:24] peace be still
[27:26] and the storm stopped as quickly as it
[27:28] began
[27:29] suddenly the second tree realized it was
[27:31] carrying the king of heaven in earth he
[27:34] rejoiced when he realized he was made to
[27:37] carry the king of glory across the sea
[27:45] not long after that
[27:47] some men came to a lumber yard
[27:50] and took the beams made from the third
[27:52] tree
[27:54] those beams were carried through the
[27:55] streets
[27:57] as an angry crowd
[28:00] mocked the man who was carrying these
[28:02] beams
[28:03] his blood and tears were stained on
[28:06] those beams
[28:08] as they continued to a top of a hill
[28:09] called golgotha
[28:11] this man's hands and feet were nailed to
[28:13] the beams
[28:15] and there in the form of a cross
[28:17] and he raised up high for the world to
[28:19] see and left to die
[28:22] but three days later
[28:24] everything changed
[28:26] the man who once hung on the third tree
[28:28] had risen from the dead
[28:30] the third tree realized that it had
[28:32] become some such a great symbol of god's
[28:35] great love for all of eternity
[28:37] that all through the ages
[28:39] everyone who looked to that cross
[28:41] would remember the love and sacrifice
[28:44] that jesus had made for them
[28:46] and that tree was never forgotten
[28:51] you see
[28:53] go ahead and give the lord
[29:03] my mama wasn't that great kiddos you
[29:07] enjoy that
[29:10] wait for me
[29:20] no bear i'm starting to think you're not
[29:21] a bear at all
[29:23] i'm barely a bear
[29:27] that was a good story happy
[29:31] i sure did enjoy it a lot of times we
[29:33] don't know what we want with our own
[29:35] lives
[29:36] but god always knows what to do with us
[29:38] that's right and he gave us the greatest
[29:41] gift of all
[29:43] his son jesus christ
[29:45] yes sir
[29:46] and it also taught me to always be happy
[29:48] with what we're given
[29:50] that's right you know a lot of times we
[29:52] want one thing but god wants another
[29:55] it kind of reminds me of that white
[29:57] elephant gift exchange last night
[30:00] oh yeah sorry for all y'all youth that
[30:02] got your feelings hurt but
[30:04] i guess god had a different plan for you
[30:06] didn't he

[37:05] to the church for glory who's got the
[37:07] best church the besties who can play
[37:09] this who can do that and the old room
[37:12] all times he got something else to do
[37:13] besides perhaps they can't pray anymore
[37:16] they got something else to do they can't
[37:18] pray anymore
[37:20] they just can't learn to serve god like
[37:21] he used to
[37:22] no room for him in the end and this has
[37:25] been the end times
[37:26] no room for me of course i know what
[37:28] that is but i've been referring to the
[37:30] sin but the bible said in that day
[37:33] one of the almond tree shall flourish
[37:36] the desire of man shall fail
[37:38] because he goes to his own home and the
[37:41] word is going out the street are the
[37:43] silver card be broken this picture broke
[37:45] of the fountain oh mercy my friends but
[37:48] the prophet
[38:04] has come to a place now that the people
[38:06] realizing that the deity and their power
[38:08] almighty god is living in the human
[38:11] beings
[38:23] welcome to our christmas program and
[38:24] thank you all for coming
[38:26] before we get started what you're about
[38:28] to see does include some timeline
[38:30] inaccuracies
[38:33] don't worry we are aware that wi-fi and
[38:35] iphones did not exist at the time of
[38:37] jesus's birth
[38:39] but these were included in the part for
[38:41] your entertainment value
[38:44] but mostly in attempts to bring this
[38:46] closer to home and provide us just a
[38:48] hint of what joseph's and mary's journey
[38:51] might have looked like in some ways
[38:52] today
[38:53] at this time the roman emperor caesar
[38:56] augustus augustus ordered a census
[38:59] this had everybody scrambling and
[39:02] traveling to their birthplaces to be
[39:03] counted in the senses
[39:06] i say it's going to take a miracle to
[39:07] keep everyone happy i mean look at all
[39:09] those people
[39:10] it's like a holiday around here
[39:12] that's it we call ourselves holiday inn
[39:16] we'll not catch you
[39:20] our sec our final group are siblings
[39:23] true manny short for emmanuel
[39:26] who
[39:30] they have recently inherited the inn
[39:32] from their grandfather as it's very
[39:34] important to him
[39:35] also very important to him are his
[39:37] grandchildren
[39:38] in fact he named it in after his first
[39:40] grandchild true
[39:42] yes yes fresh milk right away you'll
[39:45] be right up with batteries for the
[39:46] remote
[39:47] i'm sorry what do you mean you have the
[39:49] door to your room but it doesn't have
[39:50] hinges
[39:54] you know this is the business we've ever
[39:56] been not even grandfather has this place
[39:57] as packed as we do and he owned it and
[39:59] you're out here dusting a manger news
[40:01] flash man they're animals they don't
[40:03] care if it's messy
[40:04] and i could really use your help in
[40:05] there
[40:06] i'm gonna need those hinges back
[40:10] milk
[40:13] i wasn't clean this time true i was
[40:15] praying hey when grandpa lets us
[40:18] left us this place the major was a part
[40:20] of it
[40:22] this is where he was his favorite part
[40:24] this is where he came to be at peace and
[40:25] pray i know that you might not get it
[40:27] but i get it
[40:30] let me explain something to wait in that
[40:32] way that you might get it if the end is
[40:34] not a success there's no money to feed
[40:36] the animal
[40:38] okay i get it i'll be there in a second
[40:41] hand over those hinges
[40:43] yeah i can't do that
[40:49] let me explain something in a way that
[40:50] you might get it if i don't fix the
[40:53] skate then betty might get out
[40:56] eventually
[40:58] [Applause]
[41:07] [Music]
[41:16] that means no
[41:23] i bet hey
[41:34] [Applause]
[41:37] if betsy gets out that means no freshman
[41:40] for a guest
[41:49] besides we're the only game with manger
[41:52] if we fix this gate may repaint the wood
[41:54] put up some lights it could be a real
[41:56] hit
[41:57] it could be a tourist spot
[41:59] the manger that people talk about for
[42:01] ages
[42:05] i want people to talk about this old
[42:07] dusty manger it's gonna take a real
[42:09] miracle
[42:12] as most of us know shortly after young
[42:14] mary was betrothed to joseph she was
[42:17] visited by the angel gabriel gabriel
[42:20] tells mary that she that the holy ghost
[42:22] shall come upon her and she shall bear a
[42:24] son of god and his name shall be jesus
[42:27] close to jesus birth murray finds
[42:29] herself traveling to her husband's
[42:30] hometown bethlehem for the senses
[42:39] my positive is definitely gonna happen
[42:41] tonight
[42:42] i'm just saying the angel gave us a
[42:45] prophecy and even a name but he never
[42:47] gave us a date
[42:49] i just don't think anybody can surely
[42:51] tell the day or time of his comic when i
[42:53] stand up for this job now to be
[42:56] nobody told me that belonged to the
[42:58] traveling vlog i better get paid mileage
[43:01] i should do this
[43:03] i should have listened to my mother and
[43:04] god
[43:06] don't get university in medicine dumb
[43:08] it's not that much
[43:11] yeah well i should have listened to my
[43:13] mother and spent the extra shekels for a
[43:15] cold well i hope this little guy listens
[43:17] to his mother better than the two
[43:22] excuse me sir i hate to interrupt but
[43:25] it's an emergency
[43:26] there's no vacancy didn't see the sign
[43:28] outside

[43:48] a child and
[43:52] a king
[43:54] you don't believe me i unbelieve you
[43:58] i mean don't you have any kids a
[44:01] five-year-old son nemocis
[44:03] if you knew malcus was going to be
[44:05] something great wouldn't you do anything
[44:07] he is born to be something great a roman
[44:09] soldier
[44:12] what you know he have the guts for it i
[44:14] just hope he has the ear for it
[44:19] i'm telling you it's raining shackles in
[44:21] here i was even able to bring in a
[44:23] little profit with valet camel parking
[44:27] speaking of a little prophet mary ow
[44:31] no not you this guy keeps talking about
[44:33] his wife marry this and marry that as of
[44:35] the whole sentence about her they should
[44:37] rename it
[44:39] mary census
[44:44] hi i'm joseph and hi joseph i'm sue
[44:47] super as you might have seen out on the
[44:49] hotel sign
[44:50] oh so you named the hotel after yourself
[44:53] so then what's date for is there eight
[44:55] of you no we're just the ethan on this
[44:57] road
[44:58] we're thinking of a new name we keep
[44:59] telling sue that super 8 sounds
[45:01] ridiculous well maybe the new name can
[45:04] include you guys what's your name
[45:07] everybody calls me raw and this is mata
[45:10] bra
[45:12] that has a ring to it
[45:16] like i was saying all we can offer is
[45:18] census card as there is no room at the
[45:20] end sorry
[45:24] wait if the last guy was the sixth in
[45:26] and you guys are the eighth
[45:29] well there's gotta be a separate one
[45:30] right
[45:31] yeah it's at the crossing of the hill
[45:34] you mean next to the cute major huh i
[45:36] never noticed the manger
[45:40] still at it
[45:44] i don't suppose ever many guests will be
[45:46] handy with tools
[45:49] i'm not asking any of our guests to come
[45:50] work on a manger manny
[45:53] at this rate i'm just going to sleep at
[45:55] the
[45:56] i think i broke even more at this rate
[45:59] i'm just going to sleep at the drawer
[46:00] and make sure the animals don't escape
[46:03] well that's an idea but here's another
[46:04] since you're out here why don't you just
[46:06] pray about it
[46:10] that's not a bad idea
[46:17] [Music]
[46:18] hi i am a carpenter and you look like
[46:20] you could use some help
[46:25] do i ever
[46:34] uh it's happening what's happening
[46:44] that night there were shepherds in the
[46:46] field with their sheep and and the angel
[46:48] came to tell them that the savior has
[46:50] been born which is christ the lord
[46:52] the angel even told them that they could
[46:54] find a baby wrapped in soil and
[46:56] swaddling cloth lying in a manger
[47:19] oh
[47:21] [Music]
[47:33] oh
[47:37] [Music]
[47:41] is
[47:43] [Music]
[48:04] you
[48:10] new
[48:20] need a baby have you seen one
[48:22] we were with our sheep on the field and
[48:26] they were like
[48:29] and then uh angel came and then like he
[48:31] was like don't be afraid and then good
[48:33] what's man
[48:34] all right all right calm down start from
[48:36] the beginning well in the beginning was
[48:39] the word and the word was with god
[48:43] and
[48:46] that's word just a little more so moses
[48:48] and the people were in the desert and
[48:49] the rock full of the group man i found
[48:51] him
[48:55] you started with moses what was i
[48:58] supposed to start with hey we just saw a
[49:00] whole a whole host of angels out on the
[49:02] field
[49:03] yeah sounds like a movie angels in the
[49:05] outfield
[49:10] sorry for the interruption i just got a
[49:12] group of shepherds in here
[49:14] i'm not sure what they wanted i think
[49:15] they said something about starting a
[49:17] rock group
[49:19] they sure like to talk about their moses
[49:20] though i mean i could be like moses i
[49:23] grew a white beard put on a red outfit
[49:25] and instead of plagues i could give
[49:26] gifts i would have their kind follow me
[49:29] like a cloud by day forget about old
[49:31] traditions
[49:34] after a long trip and i'm finding a room
[49:36] he's actually here
[49:37] something tells me that was the easy
[49:39] part
[49:40] i'm sure you're gonna be a great model
[49:43] actually he's going to be mine
[49:45] he seems so peaceful you think he's cold
[49:49] i have this i'm sorry we can give you
[49:51] some
[49:52] more comfortable
[49:53] no this was great it was so comfortable
[49:56] inside you can rename the place comfort
[49:58] in or since mary
[50:01] or since mary loves this place so much
[50:04] you could call it the merry art
[50:08] don't get him started he already thinks
[50:10] this
[50:11] place is a tourist attraction especially
[50:13] since we have the only under the manger
[50:15] on this road i don't know who he thinks
[50:17] he's going to attract especially
[50:19] especially since people usually tie
[50:20] their camels and donkeys to places
[50:22] you'll find
[50:23] anywhere
[50:28] well i don't know true
[50:29] sheep but about sheep can't type them to
[50:32] oppose so shepherds could use the field
[50:35] here's the manger
[50:38] right ever to sleep in the fields
[50:44] cramp
[50:46] how do you keep doing that
[50:49] where is he is it him
[50:51] it's him
[50:53] there he is
[50:58] he is here
[51:00] the messiah has come
[51:04] prophecy fulfilled
[51:13] right
[51:23] they forgot their cane
[51:27] it's called a staffer cook
[51:30] i haven't i have an idea we can sell
[51:32] these
[51:36] the k
[51:38] exactly
[51:42] again guy is not a cane
[51:45] we can make little candy canes every
[51:47] year
[51:48] around every year for the locals around
[51:51] the senses
[51:52] what locals are shepherds and the romans
[51:55] yep yep we will make them white since
[51:58] shepherds like sheep and red since
[52:00] romans wear red
[52:02] where do you come up with these ideas
[52:34] i can't believe you lost a star
[52:36] it's not like i have google maps i'm
[52:38] telling you came over here somewhere
[52:41] well i don't think we'll find him over
[52:43] here i mean
[52:44] it
[52:46] this place has a zero star review
[53:04] didn't you see the sign we're closed
[53:06] well actually that's why we're here
[53:08] because we saw the sign
[53:10] we've been following a heavenly sign
[53:12] looking for the one born king of the
[53:13] jews
[53:15] whoa you guys look loaded i mean looks
[53:18] like you take a load off if you need a
[53:20] place to stay
[53:21] we don't
[53:24] you know your sign is misleading it says
[53:26] when we tell six but judging by the
[53:29] sizing condition it's clearly an in
[53:32] yeah well in sick sounds a lot like
[53:34] insects
[53:35] and i didn't want people to think this
[53:37] place was crawling around with locusts
[53:39] well it is so again
[53:41] your sign is misleading
[53:55] what a bunch of wise guys
[53:57] it's him
[53:58] the king
[54:05] hey sue look at this
[54:07] it seems like the star has attracted
[54:09] more people rich ones
[54:12] hopefully that star plans on sticking
[54:14] around
[54:15] since we have the best view of the star
[54:17] we could charge we could bring in extra
[54:19] people and charge higher prices
[54:21] we could charge higher prices and bring
[54:23] in some extra bucks
[54:25] that's it we could call ourselves
[54:26] starbucks
[54:29] do you even hear yourself
[54:33] herod wants to do what
[54:36] yeah i know malcus is under two still
[54:40] me mention a baby dollar uh i think i
[54:43] think my battery's night
[54:46] something about this doesn't seem right
[54:49] joseph
[54:50] shepherds and the wise guys all said the
[54:52] same thing is this possible i think i
[54:55] need to go find out
[54:57] where have you been all day
[54:59] i've been talking to mary and will think
[55:01] about all that's happened remember the
[55:03] the book of isaiah and micah
[55:06] do you know what this means
[55:08] we're going to have to call mom and dad
[55:09] and tell them they were right
[55:13] uh how about just a text message
[55:16] a text is
[55:18] good we have mary a baby shower
[55:21] you think they're you think they're
[55:23] registered somewhere i mean what kind of
[55:25] gifts that we can get that's going to be
[55:27] with those rich guys i'm pretty sure one
[55:29] of them brought up straight up gold

[1:07:00] growing up in the baptist church lord
[1:07:03] i never would have thought lord
[1:07:06] you had this in your plan for me and i
[1:07:08] know many of us feel the same way but
[1:07:11] you have brought us all together from
[1:07:13] different walks of life and
[1:07:15] your spirit is vibrating in our hearts
[1:07:18] lord as we
[1:07:20] desire to serve you more each day lord
[1:07:24] we surrender ourselves to you lord
[1:07:26] we pray that you bless all the children
[1:07:28] and all
[1:07:29] those that presented this play lord and
[1:07:32] all the parents
[1:07:34] all of us together lord someday we will
[1:07:36] reunite lord
[1:07:38] and never have to separate again lord
[1:07:41] but until that day lord
[1:07:43] protect us as we each go to our homes
[1:07:46] lord and as your prophet would say
[1:07:49] if i don't see you again
[1:07:51] i will see you in the morning
[1:07:54] thank you lord jesus we ask it all in
[1:07:56] your precious name in the name of the
[1:07:58] lord jesus christ amen
