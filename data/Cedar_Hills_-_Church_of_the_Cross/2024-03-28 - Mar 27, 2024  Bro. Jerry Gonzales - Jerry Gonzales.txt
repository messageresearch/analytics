um usually today I had a field trip it's an all day field [Music] trip and usually when those happen I lose a lot of um lose a lot of time at school and I accumulate a lot of work and um usually gets really stressful and like annoying and usually I just deal with it I just go ahead and just do whatever but the night before I decided to approach things a little differently and I asked the Lord to make a way for me to be able to go on this field trip and um in every single my classes we did absolutely nothing it sounds a little funny but Brothers this never happens and I praise the Lord that I had nothing to do and that he opened way for a couple years second testimony was for like almost two or two years and a half I suffered with something that's called turf toe it's basically um uh where you have like a nerve a nerve misf in your big toe and it constantly just um misfiring like it hurts it feels like if you would stub your toe and the initial pain would stay there it's it's something unbearable and um I think maybe two two months ago on a Wednesday my dad called out that demon and thanks be the Lord I've never I haven't suffered since and um through all this I realized that even though there's nothing too big for God but there's nothing too small either God bless you amen amen thank you for that brother what a mighty God we serve amen hallelujah Glory what a mighty God we

thank you brother you happy to be in the house of the Lord I just want to say it's a privilege to be with each and every one of you it's good to see each uh person here I'm a little bit shy I haven't been back here in a while but it's good to be here it's good to have my my good friend brother Morton wherever he is they made my day got to see them but I got to see each and every one of you also so the Lord help us I want to first of all thank our pastor for the for the confidence he knows why I say that that's something thing about our pastor he will pull it out of you sometimes I think ah I wish you'd have a little bit of Mercy that's exactly right this is Mercy this is for our benefit so uh not to take up much more time you turn to our scripture in Matthew 2514 message may get a little personal because it uh things that I've been dealing with and it reads give you a little bit of time say Amen when you got it and reads for the Kingdom of Heaven is a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents and to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey 16 then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents so he produced something there and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two also produced but he that had received one went and died into the Earth and hid his Lord's money he did not produce go go ahead and be seated I may read some other parts of that scripture but I'll let you be seated but um I do want to say that probably was the most important message I've ever heard brother Caleb you know because it did something to me okay said got to take get personal you know when he especially when he was talking about the the eclipse that's coming how many have been following it I'm just gonna just reiterate what he said but have you ever in any time seen a sign like that be fulfilled before your very eyes first in and 2017 started off in Salem Seven Cities of Salem and this this and and then seven years later it's going to pass Seven Cities of Nineveh so I see the 777 which is God's number and then what are the odds of the trajectory of this eclipse to pass the way it did and then hit the ex and over Rapture in in the state where the Prophet was from so you ever thought you think about that what are the odds of that happening very slim to none but it's just a sign for us it's a sign for theie showing like I said first he shows it in the heavens but it shows something's coming right so I just wanted to I just wanted to start off with that because it it really impacted me so it brought me to this if I could put a a title it's inflation the subtitle am I adding value how many knows what inflation is when you hear the word inflation what comes to mind oh there's no money right prices are high all all those are right all it's partially correct but would it surprise would it surprise if I told you that inflation is actually too much money in the economy there's so much money in the economy that they have pumped in that there was a lot of purchasing power right now with the stimulus money the deferment of all these payments there's a lot of money in circulation right now the FED has been printing a lot of money tons of money giving money to Ukraine giving money to the to all all these situations that are going on the situation at the border is not cheap they say to house and to feed certain of people is costing Millions upon Millions dollars man how many have been following that so in what is inflation let's let's define it okay it says more jobs and higher wages increase household incomes that lead to a rise in consumer spending further increasing demand and the the the scope for firms to increase the prices when this happens a large number of businesses and sectors said when when there like I said when they pump out so much money the these companies start to inflate prices but there's another scope that happens so I don't remember the the co lockdowns it seems like it was forever ago right it was just a few years ago he said but what happened during that time during the lockdown no one could go anywhere I said and they pumped all kinds of money for assistance but there was nobody to work nobody wanted to work so what happened there was a bottleneck that happened because there was not people to work the factories to work in certain jobs the goods were not being delivered to the people you you see that there was a lot of how many remember the picture with the ships in the harbor well the ships were full of were of goods lots of goods there but no one to want to work no one willing to go and to go and get the goods from the ship get them off the harbor and bring them into the land or bring them to the people so that also caused a bottleneck because what happened there how many were trying to buy a car during that time we know that there was a shortage a shortage of computer chips a shortage of a lot of electronic parts so what happened so because there was a shortage of of of these parts it caused an inflation of the prices of vehicles so people were buying vehicles at 10 20 $30,000 overpriced so there was an inflation that happened right and this part's a little dry in the beginning but just bear with me trying to set a little Foundation okay so did you know in 1913 the dollar was worth a dollar right 1913 the dollar was worth a dollar the purchasing power of a dollar was a dollar so we fast forward now to 2024 and they're saying that in order to to be equivalent to that $1 in 19113 let see if I can find it so I can read it here but they're saying that that dollar today you would have to make a total of $31 I believe to make $31 today to be equivalent to the dollar back in 19113 so what is this do to the economy you young people that maybe want to buy a home in the near future what has happened to the home prices they have the prices have inflated so bad at a house that was worth 190,000 brother Justin correct me if I'm wrong they're worth about 350 to 400,000 now so like I said because they have pumped all this money into the economy the more money they pumped out the more devaluation of the dollar that has been so they say since 1913 it has lost about 96 96% of it of its purchasing power it so what Satan uses this to bring fear to the people to back up the people into a corner they feel like they don't know where to go what am I going to do am I going to eat this month I know some of the elderly people being on fixed incomes uh elderly people being on fixed incomes what they do it destroys their their their um their finances so Satan is using this tool and the platform is being set up so that eventually this boycott that we've been hearing about it's going to force the people they said like we've heard this is another message to take the mark to take the Mark or not you you cannot buy you cannot sell we're there just about there so so so Satan like I said this is a tool that he's using but don't fear there's no reason to fear because Satan only mimics and he and he he only does what he sees God doing well how does God use inflation watch this and I don't it shouldn't be that long tonight okay how does God use inflation you ever thought think about that the natural types the spiritual okay so do you know that time they call it the great equalizer it doesn't matter who you are if you're a celebrity a millionaire a president of the United States whoever time is the great equalizer because you cannot purchase no more of it you're not giving more of it you cannot obtain it anyhow the time that you're allotted is the time that you're given you can't buy any more of it so keep that in mind so young people what do you the scripture what is does the scripture say honor your mother and father so that your time is not cut even more short now we know that God cut the time he says if the days were not shortened no flesh would be saved and we're going to get to that and how that gives value to the bride it's God is going to show you tonight the value that each one of you have the value that you have Paul amen amen what does brother brand say how how many worlds is your soul worth anybody how many when he says 10,000 and then he says 10 million is that a contradiction we'll find that in a bit we'll find that in a bit so Satan is mimicking what God is doing watch this remember something when there is a product in demand or when there's a shortage of a product what happens people go crazy and people will pay over they'll pay a top dollar for it how many remember the incident with the toilet paper everybody was freaking out right oh my goodness I think I had my brother even uh Nathan he wanted to go steal it from my house when we were in out of town but watch it it sounds funny but cut something short let's something let something let there be a shortage of it and people will do anything for it people will fight tooth and nail for it amen amen that also causes inflation it causes if if I had a million of these I can't give them away you know and there's a million of there's there's sufficient to go around for everybody I can't give this away you know people waste water like it's nothing but let the same bottle of water right here let them put out a news notice that there is a shortage of water and there's only a few left of these and Watch What Happens amen amen the value of this will Skyrocket amen amen so like I said this is a it was a little bit tough for me to put together it everything that could go wrong went wrong it's and it's been a it's been a bad I was telling brother Caleb you know how he felt that heaviness the other day I can't even imagine with the burden that he deals with but with my little burden I was telling the wife and I shouldn't have told her cuz she got l scared I was driving and I I like almost fell asleep a stick shift so so there there there's that he I but it's like Tommy said he said we got to shake ourselves off Tommy I tried to wiggle my way out a little bit because I'm like brother Caleb I don't I don't feel ready for this he says my grace is sufficient for you perfect strength through perfect weakness what do you say to that you got to be obedient I have to be obedient so when something is in demand and production is low value skyrockets amen amen Matthew 24:22 so you could read it okay except those days be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elect sake those days shall be shortened what happens when you cut something short now the word sake stood out to me and and it brought me to to to Define it but watch watch the synonym of of sake for the elect sake if you see number five and six is gain so he's cutting time so that the bride can gain value so she now like I said we're going to build up to it okay you're going to see how valued you are of God you're going to see that you're the purchase that almighty God God of the universe can you imagine would step aside step aside from his majesty and would come and shed his blood for you and I that you meditate on that and that blows your mind and we're coming up on Easter so we're going to hear about that but can you imagine Mighty God stepping aside from his majesty getting off his throne just for you and I how much value was that what what should that do to us what should that do to me my goodness but so for her sake for her gain for her profit which is also gain which he'll cut the days or the time for her value so that means now when she speaks there's something that happens when she prays it produces something it should produce something right that's where this message hit me cuz we we say many times and I've said it before catch my spirit on how I say this okay now we have said I have said we have the best in this church the word that we hear from this church from this Pulpit amen amen I have to agree with that then I asked myself the question with the best this word that's the best what am I producing with I should I me I should be producing the best and I saw myself many times just sitting idle doing nothing hiding the talent like the one that was giving the one so I'm we have to do something about that or that will be taken away from me it will be taken away from me so so what is it parable of the 10 virgins he a lot about Parables parable of the 10 virgins let me let me ask you a question how many of them slept all of them slept they all slept but one heard the call when one of them imagine this so we got the wise virgin and the foolish virgin they both have the word I remember our founding Pastor say one time does the foolish virgin have the word do they know the word absolutely sometimes even better so what's the difference what produced with the word and the other just stayed with it I don't want to be caught in that so we have to produce I have to produce something has to done because I'll tell you one thing so when they took the the United States off the gold standard in 1971 they took the value from the dollar there's nothing backing it up now we know that the United States now is is they go off what was called treasury bonds and brother Carlos correct me if I'm wrong there nothing but I will use there's nothing what I will use I owe you that's all it is it's an i you it's paper backing paper so that's what happened when they took us off the gold standard now if I run it now and the natural types of spiritual I see that there's a lot of word out right now there's word on the internet on the tablet in the books in the people there's tons of word out right now there's lots of purchasing power we have it in our hands the word is the purchasing power but you know what ruins the economy there's what's called the supply and demand curve so there's a supply and there's a demand okay so if there's lots of purchasing power out okay we can buy a lot of goods but production is not keeping up with that then that's what's causing inflation too much purchasing power not enough Goods to go around it inflates the price amen amen are you following me watch this so we have the word in our hands but it cannot stay in word only it's no difference with the example where they say if the word stays in this form it'll kill you righten it has to become flesh and the only way it becomes flesh I have to produce it you have to produce it we have to produce our part whatever part that we play we have to produce because God's economy the natural types of spiritual supply and demand have to meet when supply and demand meet called equilibrium it's a flourishing economy so I believe in part that you see that that X point in the eclipse that there will be an equilibrium that there will be a people that not only have the word but produce the word it has to produce God's word cannot come back void look there's there's proof back there right brother Diego I got two twins back there the word came out but there was a production the word produced it did not come back void and the proof is back there either my mom or my faith someone stand up there's the proof where's the baby you got show the proof show the product amen amen so we have to produce I have to produce amen Amen brother Bram let me see where I'm at here much time do I have so we see we heard we've heard the message brother Bram says of those that make the word of no effect you've heard that right and we think that it's out there wait a minute if I have the word in my hand in my mind just in my mind and I don't produce with it the word is not producing it's a form of making the word of no effect it's not having an effect on anybody it's not helping anyone it may edify what I know and I can read definitions of brother Bram I can quote brother Bram I can quote brother Tommy tomm I can quote our pastor brother Caleb but if it only stays up here it does no good makes the word of no effect I have to do something with that word that word has to be released through me the only word that this falling this Fallen World will ever know brother Bram is not here Tommy's not here our pastor's here thank God we are the only word that certain people will ever know so that word has to produce it has to produce through you watch brother brand oh so yeah I said that excuse me brother Ron hit this the other day on something our founding Pastor would say a lot he says you better pack the goods packing the goods so I got I point to myself I better be packing the goods head knowledge that's hearing the Bri the bridegroom and not doing nothing with it but the wise oil in their lamp and they did not run out that's the key right there because the foolish had oil but she ran out she stopped producing amen amen she had it in her hands but she could not produce any longer amen amen so it comes to this am I adding to God's economy am I adding value so like I said the dollar lost value 96% of it when it went off the gold standard so if you have the word and no deity to back it up it's paper it's paper it's head it won't do no good it will not produce there's got to be that life behind the life behind the name that's what makes the demons tremble deity has to be present what so we have to excuse me purchasing power see it a little bit different now it's okay to have it you got to have that the money in your in your pocket in your wallet but it has to produce something so we got to pack the goods remember having too much purchasing power and no Supply that means I'm not producing something to give to God's economy will cause an inflation maybe a lot of times maybe I because I know a little bit I inflate my my head a little bit inflation that's the opposite of the inflation that we want the full word has come amen amen there's no reason that we should not be able to produce we have to produce amen amen so watch this so this is a I wrote this down because I don't want to forget so why is it that they want to remove the hand from delivering the goods remember a person to go to the ship Harbor get the goods to bring them to land so that they can be hand delivered to the people don't remove the hand you remove the hand you cause inflation in the message then you cause the word to not have an effect it has to come through the hand it's hand delivered do you believe that what happens many times though there's a boycott coming there stand to come A World Council of churches and a boycott and mark of the beast we have to watch that spirit because that spirit will come and it'll boycot somebody oh I'm gonna cut this person off oh I don't want I don't like this person for whatever reason it's a boycot we have to be very careful because that spirit will come in first like that and then we know like I said the World Council of churches the mark of the beast so you have to Pro provide value to God's economy the word must produce you know I appreciate brother brother Isaac so about a year back I hurt my back really bad I couldn't walk very well so I guess I don't know if they announced it at the church and they prayed for me but he did something for me that really that hit me and usually when people do something for me like that I never forget but he took me a basket of a bunch of goods and he hand delivered them to my house and it was not cheap I tell you what he had a lot of stuff in there for my back a bunch of snacks and I appreciate that brother thank you but it helped me so what what does that show me brother brother Robert Rodriguez I had never also given him thanks for something he did rodrig when I first moved here we didn't have much money and uh we're struggling and my glasses broke and so I had to glue one side I didn't have no money I saw brother Robert Rodriguez at the Walmart one time and he and he saw me that I was struggling with it without hesitation pulls out $100 and says here go get yourself some glasses I'll be pay for them what does that show what am I trying to communicate to you here there are simple seven simple ways to love and to add value to others I'm going to give you the seven steps use it through the lens of the message okay I don't know if you have one Brothers if put it up there but watch this perform random acts of kindness number one number two be generous hospitable thoughtful Fair and quick to forgive encourage others and give praise what Praises do being neighborly be there for others be open to a challenge and be accountable and then number seven says use your talents and gifts this was off a website I can't remember the the hospital they had these seven steps on how to add value to somebody so that's what I saw brother brother Isaac I saw that okay I witnessed it I was a a a recipient of the product and because of you I said that help me I appreciate it same thing with brother Robert so we see these things and that there they are up there if you want to jot them down but it's good to do those things many times in the message we're just going and going going ah whatever and we forget about the person next to us let me rephrase that I forget about the person next to me to preach this message I had to make a couple of things right with a couple of people I just have to be honest I had to go and make things right I could not preach this message and have and in my conscience be right because that's one of the things that's preventing the new births brother Caleb what is it a lot of unconfessed sin a lot of negativity a lot of things against one against the other speaking for myself but I made it right if I'm given the opportunity God allowed me a little bit more time you better believe I'm going to take it use these seven steps because it produces something and the message says that every seed bring forth of its kind so if it if if if it's an apple tree what does an apple tree produce it produces apples if we revolved off God God if we revolved off God then what should we be producing we are part of God then we'll produce exactly what Jesus Christ did or I will produce what Jesus Christ did and we like I said coming up on Easter we're gonna find out what he did so every seed is going to bring forth of its kind so why are so few new births I thought a lot about this when I was in the ncu in the hospital I had a lot of time to think there when my boys were in there for seven weeks and and I saw that even full-term babies needed assistance a lot of them couldn't breathe sister they were they were nine months they were born but they could breathe on their own they had to go into the ncu for assistance of course my boys boys were born in 31 weeks so I got to see a lot of that they needed assistance breathing they needed a feeding tube they had to get their eyes checked they had to get their hearts checked get their brain checked and I would watch them and they would forget to breathe something essential to life but they would forget to breathe so that's why they were on the vapo machine I believe it's called and and it would do is it would force air into their lungs to remind them and I thought to myself I wonder if that's what's partly what's happening they needed the Nur assistance they needed the doctor's assistance they needed our assistance just to make it just to come to full term just to be normal I was thinking is I wonder if that happens a lot of times when we need to care for these babies coming in many times because of the time specialized treatment is needed that doesn't only fall on the pastor that doesn't fall in the pastor solely that falls in all of us because we've been in the message so long there's a lot of RN nurses and pediatricians and stuff here a lot of specialists in the word so was I was I was watching that and I was like wonder if wonder if amen amen you following me Sayan he uses all these things to scare us again he wants to suppress God's people God uses inflation to boost the bride's value so under God's inflation adjustment rate watch what he does brother Bram and now that's the kind of meeting we want to have every time I've preached to hundreds of thousands and I've preached just four or five but I wouldn't say I wouldn't be any more sincere with 500,000 than I would with five people because one soul is valued to God as 10,000 worlds oh here comes the here's the contradiction here or what seems to be what happens the prophet being a Seer knowing the value at the end time all the prophets wanted to live in this time why because of the amount of value that was going to be placed brother brand with the watch the inflation adjustment rate that was 19554 okay I was up at a big Museum not long ago and looking at some of the estimation of a man weighed 150 pounds how much chemicals there was in his body you know how much there there is when he is all rendered up he's worth about about 84 cents then you'll put a $10 hat on 84 cents and a $500 mink coat and turn your nose up if it rained it would drown you and then go along taking care of that 84 cents right thinking you're somebody and you don't you don't give a care you act like it about that Soul that's worth 10 million the difference the rashly how [Music] we Jesus keeps all his appointments so he cut time boosted your and I our value so it's not 10 th000 worlds anymore your value now is 10 million worlds if that doesn't make you shout that God would think that of you and I then nothing will amen amen he dries up our value except those days be shortened no no flesh would be saved all to Skyrocket our value homes have gone up in valy right brother David we're talking about the homes going up in value everything's more expensive right now at the end of the day am I contributing to the go to God's economy am I giving or taking am I adding value brother Bram a perfect man when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God has you might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of Faith but when these virtues grow in and you add it to that then you're a living Monument amen amen so I'll wind down here because I don't know how long I've been going but brother Bram says how could Our Testimony stand up to those that were re by lions at the steak oil in oil now if you look at it just if you look at it just like that oh yeah know hard testimony cannot stand up to I know no way but watch this angle I have to say Amen if I look at it pound for pound the to say it took them five minutes to get eaten whatever I mean which is not you look at it in five minutes to the five minutes the that we have endured with whatever issue no comparison no comparison at all but if I take those same five minutes and I compare them to somebody that's been going through something for the past 20 years 30 years 10 years which one is which one's harder I have to say Amen to the prophet amen minutes for five minutes of course not but you look at each person that has been standing here watch this those are terrible it's terrible what happens to them but for us to endure the 200,000 thousand charges that we battle every single day those demons that hang heavy on you on your thoughts on your emotions on your body for years I'll tell you one thing the enemy is wondering how in the world you're still standing he he he doesn't know what to do with it is that when he has thrown all this you do the math of 200,000,000 Chargers against the bride and it's like I didn't do the math do the math but what she has to endure every single day like I said I don't go very far you look at our pastor you look at our pastor I don't have to go very far the load that he carries the load that brother brother long has carried Tommy Jimmy Jerry the load we have to end each and every one of you Brother Carlos martinz back there he's been sick and look at him it amazes me that he will not miss church to see brother re come up and sing a special wow that blew me away but it shows the value of the Bride today it shows that she's willing to endure all these demons why because she's gotus sayth the lord it's inside of her right now now we'll have it he has it right now who is it that's inside of you who is it that dwells inside of who is at the table to do these things you see brother pray for the people you see you see our pastor pretty much every category brother Loreno is singing no one moves ACR like brother Tommy J songmy J Brother Carlos Hill the way he teaches brother Daniel brother Abraham I mention everybody why there's value today there's value today and the enem is wondering how because we have each other because he'll defeat Us by ourselves he'll defeat Us by ourselves but but together he can't touch us the Holy Spirit back in Pentecost it broke into into pieces but today it's coming back together you believe that that's how endure the floods so watch this let me I'll read this and I'll finish with this I tell each and person here every person standing here right now you have stood in the lines then you have endured the floods you have waited 25 years you have come through the fire you have been resurrected he says well for example Abraham waited 25 years for a child what if I tell you that I waited just as long he waited 25 years I waited 16 years but under the inflation and adjustment rate it's the same time and it's worth more today because of everything that we've had to through all hell against us the devil is wondering how you're standing how do these young people stand how is it possible because we have each other and because we're taught not to have the word only but that word has to produce and it's producing in each and every one of you we are a special class of not only because we hear the best but we're able to understand it digest it and produce and give to God's economy add value to the economy to make the adjustment in your own life whatever you've been going through it's it's amazing even to the point where all the prophets they wanted to live in this time because it was going to be worth so much more under the adjustment rate under the reevaluation you're worth more than 10 million world he jump from not 10,000 he says it 37 times that's okay but for this time he said it seven times 10 million worlds if the musician would come now produce you give it the opportunity tonight you can produce something in your life right now the young people and we always say I'm not going to sit here and say you're having a hard time you're not having a hard time you have the ability to produce given the opportunity to we're gonna like I said if you if you have a need how many have a need do you feel you need something maybe I haven't maybe I felt like I haven't been producing maybe I haven't been producing enough right all you have to do surrender yourself it's as simple as that but that's the word you heard me can't stay with that word you got to do something with it and now it's in your hands but I'll tell you one thing the amount of purchasing power in your hands right now tonight is incredible remember not 10,000 worlds 10 million worlds the rest is up to you amen would you please [Applause] [Music] stand there is no problem too big God cannot solve it do you believe that tonight there is no mountain to T God
