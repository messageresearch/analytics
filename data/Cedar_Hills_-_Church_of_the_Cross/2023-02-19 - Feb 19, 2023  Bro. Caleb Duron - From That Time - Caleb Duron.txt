enjoyed all the specials that we've heard over the weekend my favorite thing is to hear specials when they come from the heart not to say that people that you know I think everybody's saying from the heart this week but you know I'm I'm privy to some of those that saying some of those are saying this weekend or from my church and I know the life behind what they're singing so I I don't I don't like to promote anybody and that's my way but uh yesterday when Sister Mariah and the two girls and sister it changed everything it changes uh everyone that sang this weekend you could tell was coming right from here I appreciate all the all the the specials I appreciate the the preaching of the words that message from Brother Morton where is he ate here he is here he is that message is going to go around the world brothers and it was wonderful to see that we all come out of our dark stage amen we're not just a picture in black and white either no no foreign man man yeah just killed us yes it took a second but they caught it yeah an absolute Masterpiece how many died last night how many is going to die daily in the presence of God I greet you on behalf of the rest of the little Temple back home in English yeah all of those that are watching around the world Amen and so we thank you and would you please stand for the reading of the words amen I think all those that came back came down from Phoenix he didn't come for me but God bless God bless you for the Tim amen God bless brother Tommy Jr amen thank you for the confidence for the Diego all of you God bless you amen may God bless you would you give the Lord a hand of praise you know uh I know you're used to me being a little more ready to go you're saying but there's something different going on in the room how many believe that he's here he's been here the whole weekend amen but there is something different that's here now and so I'm just taking my time we have all day and while in eternity we have all eternity because I just don't want to rush whatever it is he wants to give you you know is that all right would you turn in your Bibles with me to Ecclesiastes chapter three now I'll explain my outfit in a little while I want to let you know that I'm not overdressed you all are just underdressed but I'll explain a little bit I think those that are spiritual already caught the idea if you think you know why I'm dressed this way raise your hand let me see you step inside the spiritual folks in here Amen brother Jack hey model Jack I just can't get over that message last night I give you the king of eye so Satan got beat last night Satan got ambushed last night [Music] Satan thought that while he had us on the Run he turned around and saw his fire getting put out is that right yes correct we put his fire out he's got no power amen Ecclesiastes three verse we'll read through verse 8. through everything there is a season and the time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from him a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to end and a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak A Time To Love a time to hate a time of War in a time of Peace Lord we're in your hands all the different things that have been said already today from the brother's prayer when he said we have stones to throw at the Devils the Lord we're in your hands father that we are Overcomers Lord that we are dancing on the devil's grave dancing all over the enemy Lord to realize the picture that is being taken or rather that is being developed from the picture that was taken before the foundation of the world Lord to know that I have died last night Lord my God and I always stand in your presence once more knowing that we are standing in the presence under the blood of Jesus Christ that this would be the hour but this would be the time you make yourself real more real than we have ever seen before bless these people now I pray [Music] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for there is none greater can we say amen amen God bless you baby do you love him with all your heart to the one next to you and say I love the Lord say do you love it amen amen I'll give the Lord a hand to praise just thinking on the theme that we have this morning the title of the sermon is from that time and uh I got inspired a few weeks back we had brother Bernie Garcia Jr he came and spoke for us on a Wednesday night and the Lord allowed him to do an amazing thing he forgot his notes he had a sermon planned for about a week and he realized he forgot his note is not that so he went from his job back to his house put him on the couch went and did a few things real quick left the house again and realized that he had left his nose second time we come into the office that I have no notes it is that's all right you're still preaching we don't get out of things that easy around here he looked at me kind of sad I said you're not a novice don't preaching long enough you can do it and he got up and preached one of the best Services I've ever heard him preach but he made a statement talking about his father brother Garcia was telling him what his life was like before he met the Lord and he was telling him about all the things that he used to do and the kind of young man that he was the Lord Jesus Christ and he makes this statement here and from that time and that just caught my attention so this morning the message was called from that time and so I was thinking on these thoughts here when we become of age we begin to plan for our funeral we kind of get romantic about it you know who's going to be there somewhere you're laughing because you know I'm not lying um write down notes this morning you know who's going to be there some of you plan to Die Young I don't know where you get these plans but you plan to die here for whatever reason you envision your mom crying your dad crying especially with you Orlando is a funny word anyway and uh especially when you're mad at everybody I'm gonna die one of these days and everybody's gonna find out how much they love me oh man the Lord showed me so much right now I wish y'all would stop but it's your fault all right okay so then we we we we we know what songs we want to have sang in our funerals what kind of casket we want to live if I'm talking to anybody let me see your hands funeral planners in here and uh you know listen my funeral is playing you want to hear what the plans are okay it's one hour of Silence at the graveside nobody says nobody sings anything nobody said the preachers nobody gets up and says any nice words about me my thought process is this if you didn't tell me while I'm alive chance to say when I'm dead trying to fool everybody know you don't like me you're sick say everybody like it you're the reason he's in the grave yes come on right I keep pointing at gray hairs and tell you who gave them to me praise the lord we go on planning like that we buy life insurance we buy life insurance if I should go prematurely first of all God don't take nobody home prematurely but see in our minds if I go prematurely then there's money to take care of the the expenses the plot yeah the services the casket little money for the family to live off until they get things together all of this planning goes into your dad but we do very little to plan uh our life being uh to make plans of our life we don't make the proper Arrangements we make arrangements to die but no arrangements to live and I say this morning if we would take as much care and stop the premeditation of how it's going to be at our funeral for how we're going to die or how we're going to take our lives or whatever it might be if we would take more cow on account on accounting of how we're going to live our life but not just live our lives how the Lord could live my life foreign back into his perfect world so God works it out but if I could do it over there I would serve God every day of my life I would have finished high school I would have listened to Dad a little more I would have taken into account the things that they were saying I would not have missed a single church service if I could have been at home I would have never got an attitude when Dad said let's pray if I could do it over I would live every minute of my temporary life David praise and honor and Glory amen that's what I would do yes look at your idea I miss the days when my dad would say let's pray sir you know I I just wish I could do it over but see I want you to understand that yesterday yeah again on on February the 18th of 2023 you all took care of your funeral is without spending one dime [Music] do you understand that you didn't have to buy a casket you didn't have to plan out a song because every song they were saying last night at the funeral absolutely perfect absolutely amen the story that was being told the preacher that was testifying of the ones that died he said the right words correct the right scriptures were reading the right atmosphere was was said and you gave up your life you gave up your life in your funeral is the most monetarily inexpensive there ever was of course but spiritually foreign [Applause] do you love them what's the point we've got to die if you cannot die to yourself then God can never resurrect inside of you yes how can the Lord bring forth a lie come on when it's got when your heart is bombarded with your own life God can never outpour his Spirit on you or inside of you while you're yet holding on to your own spirit is that right yes correct if you ever want to make God laugh how many would like to make the Lord no takers huh I'll tell you how you do it you tell him your plans for your future and you'll get a chuckle out of God that's a good one brother Jimmy yes that's a good one she's let me tell you what you're really going to do that's a good one brother Perez okay but sit down I'll tell you what you're really going to do that's a good one young sister that's fine you want to be a model put down the selfie let me tell you what's really going to happen Mr America boys UFC fighting not gonna happen if you want to fight get in this fight amen man do you love him liaman the purpose of dying is so that we can take all the spirit of God in the spirit of God will keep that old nature resurrecting again the problem with us is that we come to an often we'll die we'll repent and get right with God but within we don't take on the holy ghosts so what happens is that's a total of eight if you can't do that and now you're in April you're now Eightfold the devil than you were the first time now then you can get down and get rid of those eight Devils but for everyone another seven comes back [Applause] they don't care anymore about you than they did when you were there foreign [Applause] yeah you're out of the frame is oh you were those people use this and pictures develop you're like this is you know what I'm saying are you behind somebody else who who's that guy can the system you're out of focus what God has in mind I saw the picture of the church the congregation out front and you know I look I'm trying to find everybody that I know but that's what God has in mind but in his picture everybody is visible for a son deceiveless you understand what I'm saying I go to church I'm a good member is not going to get you anywhere I is going to get you into trouble I is going to take you back to where I should have never been foreign if you could die every day after all those days you could be born again every day tell me I'm wrong brother Brandon said even nature itself testified in the morning the son's a newborn baby in the middle of the day it's in it and it says about 12 o'clock it's in the prime of Life about three or four and it starts to get older yeah in its 40s and it's fifties but in the morning yeah is that right correct so you need the Holy Ghost Necessities the purpose of sinning the Holy Ghost was for God to continue what I threw a bunch of people to continually manifest God I said manifest God it doesn't say manifest [Applause] or Amazing Grace temples it says continually manifest God to the world is that right not by a Creed not by a denomination but by the power of his resurrection see you died last night she resurrected this morning today many of you will die again in the morning your eyes again tell me your backside in your eyes again over and over and over again the power of his resurrection feeling in the pride of Jesus Christ now that's right I guess they're not enough black people in here to appreciate that one you know it's just because the Mexicans outnumber everybody else in the room does not mean you're not a minority I hate to wake you up this morning oh yo Brown and black-faced people brownies and and those brownies are all minorities the world don't want you the world don't like you don't love you they're not your friends they're not looking out for you please [Applause] God had already done for you hear me it's good to me but praise be to God he could not steal what he never gave you oh my God the resurrection is Alive and Well the minority pride of Jesus Christ he could not take your praise never lost my praise thank you Lord gracias you're a minority and I'd rather stay with a minority group anytime amen and believe in God and watch the black skies in the power of God move in and take over here that's what he wants what you did last night is what he wanted see this you see why I feel so good walking up to that line yeah God honored so many of you the minute you walked out of the Pew there were so many of you that you fought that reluctance everybody knows I'm a pillar in this church [Applause] your social standing won't get you nowhere with God you got out of your chair and decided to get into this line I'll tell you under the inspiration of Almighty he met you the minute you got out of the chair foreign [Applause] foreign I need you to pay attention I need the young people you ready which absolutely is absolutely it's spelled at the milk of sin and safe absolutely absolutely expelled it's funny the guilt of sin and same here what's the other last word guilt and shame if you feel guilty the blood of Jesus can take that guilt away if you feel shame and you're embarrassed how can I ever marry a man put these things in my past so this is absolutely expelled absolutely foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] let me make it one more a little more clearer if God can't play bring it to me then I have no right to bring it up myself turn around tell somebody I have no right they tell you of my path now you turn right back to say you don't have a path [Applause] [Applause] Glory [Music] you don't gotta pass because the Holy Ghost expelled it he buried my sins carried my guilt far away yeah foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] I I am three you're sorry leaving you are free that is leaving [Music] [Applause] can I go on I'm not done yet we're free when you turn this time it say you're free now here's the more I see somebody not turning turn yeah I'm talking to you yo did he go right in front of Mariah that little lady's not doing it yeah you do it all right everybody do it see Marie you're free you know blinded eyes got opened up last night instead but blinded eyes that are open are going to manifest itself soon now here's one harder foreign come on waiting amen you believe it you said okay give the Lord a hand to pray all right where was I oh my God well the Holy Ghost came forward um thank you there we go all right absolutely I say that again we're going to get started again amen amen it absolutely expelled the guilt of sin and shame absolutely believe it in that God comes right down in a human body into that human body by the sanctifying of the of that blood but it's not just that we're saved Watch What Happens now it's him into Abraham seed by faith you're not just saying you know just God the spirit brother you are now made royalty is oh I don't understand the Jews I know it was for a purpose so we could be saying I get it but you know I kind of want to just look and see and you guys rejected this is what were you thinking well I'm glad that you weren't thinking okay because everything you had coming Grace Grace I gladly received world would not take the Lord really gave it to me I'm glad they didn't take it yes but I'm glad they didn't take it I'm glad they didn't take it even our own the extreme revelation of the message the deeper it goes no more it seems to just shake people off I'm not cutting nobody else that's not my job but I however I have to say it like this there are a lot of people falling away for them but if if I'm being real I'm even more happy that I am sad yes because I'm standing in front of a group of people today dead or not going to fall away there's a lot that's not going to make it when I said but praise be to God I said praise be to God alone I am going to make your lawyer said you are going to what I said he already said I could okay he already said I made it nothing to do with me go this work is not about me the bride is not about me the bride is for Jesus Christ or because of him to God be all the glory Gloria to believe that the blood I'm running out of time to believe how much money we got all right do you believe that God would uh excuse me to believe that the blood would come that pure blood that would be a miracle like this Blood walked over there after this place he's talking about brother Abraham having children after 25 years of being dead skip ahead to uh paragraph 101 in that same message as long as God has got a People God has got a church God has got the Holy Ghost marching with it that's what God gave the Holy ghosts that's what God gave the Holy Ghost foreign [Applause] that'll move right on with the baptism of the Holy ghosts and they'll be the ones they will be the one it was when I said a chaos Nosotros you will be the ones through their testimony testimony what testimony I went back out God brought me back here I fell seven times seven times God stood me up my testimony is not just Grace My Testimony is Amazing Grace me testing on your soup I once was lost Amen brother Mike through their testimony you will judge the world oh I worry about those they try to hurt you when they stand before and beg for their life and Jesus looks at you and says it's all up to you it is I know what I do you say okay but you're the one they offended have I got an example of that do I got some time wasn't it brother Brandon said there was a couple sitting in the audience I can't even fathom this and I don't know what his idea of making out is Let's Be Careful you know what I mean my idea is me there he said they were making out it is what would you do pastor and he said he told him stop that please don't do that and they kept going I mean where were the Deacons anyway I'm not going to go there you know I'm not talking to you brother Jeff you're all right they kept going on the prophet of God said yes without even flinching whatever you say because the angel okay langel had one mindset that's wrong they deserve to die now whatever you say man of God put in the hair yeah whatever you say in the prophet of God looked down I forgive you YOLO [Applause] you know what you're going to do the Bible or brother Brown said that God was pleased with that decision you know you premeditate you know you premeditated this too oh don't do it I'll call you out you know you sat there you said one day they're going to stand before me and I'm going to send them straight to hell if that is your attitude you will actually be on the other side of the judgment I know you'll say you want to really hurt people that hurt you I know but if you could find it in your heart to forgive them now you will forgive them there you'll never get your reward oh I don't know how I got off on that that's right he goes on to say your testimony today will bring judgment against the city that our testimony in the baptism of the Holy ghosts and the power of God he said a holy life will bring judgment against this city and through that by scattering of your life he said and the baptism of the Holy Spirit about this mother Spirit to Santo and by the lives that you live and the things that God has done to prove that he's moving here and with their intellectuals walked away from it they will be judged by the Saints they're already judged yes he's not talking about the people being judged he's saying the Saints are already judged and he says and they have passed it hey you've already been judged you passed the test last night when you decide to swallow your pride [Applause] last night was a test and I don't know if you notice and I'm Not tooting my own horns do you love him let me see where I'm going here he says here in paragraph 104. Thanks sermon some of you people walking along saying well I just can't quit drinking I just can't wait the Holy Ghost comes to live in here instead and make these kids [Music] get away from here [Music] through Christ [Music] amen amen he said make women stop cutting their hair I'm not getting embarrass her but there's a sister here and I I was able to see I think the last three years or so her transformation from a from from a backslid life to a holy life and her hair has grown so fast can't even tell that she ever cut it I want to tell you this is no longer cut here the day after you cut it you understand what I'm saying if you cut it here that same hour it begins to grow again if you keep the scissors off of it it don't matter how long it is it will grow back as if you never cut it you understand what I'm saying it's wonderful to watch that growth is it make you quit wearing shorts and slacks no excuses made you quit tattling it'll follow the instructions of the Bible every time this he goes on at 105. a woman say it's just too hot I just have to wear these gives me a headache if I let my hair grow he said there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost no excuses it's there to make it so it'll follow the word just exactly that's what the Holy Ghost came to do is to make you turn your head from them half naked women Brothers if I may tell a testimony it might help you Brothers if you have a problem staring at women you should ask your wife is it okay if I tell you is think he's pretty okay it would just keep me from entertaining anything he is what I didn't expect was the answer if I said someone was pretty she turned around and pick them apart she's pretty if you like girls but this this is by God she's right she is ugly yeah you Brothers do the same thing burn oh yeah he's handsome [Music] that's not a goatee he's not a man I'm a man just like your number right correct but the Holy Ghost will keep you from doing those things don't don't fool yourself [Applause] if I get too late just tell me he said he said uh hung that wooden cross in the car here brother green said it was a lady an Hispanic woman he said wearing but yeah business pencil skirt suit yeah and brother Brandon Brandon all the way across the crosswalk um look to the cross it said brother Perry he said Perry that's why we have the cross to remind us of Who We Are a man's a man and women don't don't fool yourself y'all are worse than we are because you don't say nothing about it they're just keeping it real man that's why I like for brother Jack said last night about clothes in the closet and you look at me who started because he didn't say it to the women he said it to the men too I like that what fake but could you wear that hat tell us was it Babylonians foreign [Music] I'm hurting myself I hope you see that yeah I don't want to cause God's people to fail you know is anybody too proud or will you say me too Lord I got this 12-foot beam in my eyes Atlanta it'll make you turn your head from them healthy women and quit listening and it'll it'll quit it's to quit making you smoke and drink 106. it'll make you stop wanting to be a big shot it'll take that out of you and I'll say this or your mistakes will uh I would rather the Holy Spirit humble me that for me to go out and do something stupid and it humbled me yeah my days of making those kind of mistakes have got to be over foreign this will make you get it that's what the Holy Ghost is powered foreign [Applause] [Applause] if it's hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come when the church is open then there is something wrong with that spirit amen is that right correct it trying to keep you away from God the spirit of God will run you right straight to the church it is do
