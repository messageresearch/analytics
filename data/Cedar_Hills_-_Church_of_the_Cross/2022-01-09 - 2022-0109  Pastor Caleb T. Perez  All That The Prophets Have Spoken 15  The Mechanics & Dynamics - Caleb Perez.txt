[Music] [Music] is [Music] amen god bless you this morning we are always as we say we are very happy to be in the house of the lord and we know many we never want this to become common to us it's renewed every day amen we want to first of all give our condolences to our brother reece and then we also want to give our condolences to sister andrea andrea and her family on the passing of father [Music] [Music] you know but we'll get as far as the holy spirit tells us luke 24 25 and it reads like this then he said unto them a false slaw of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken i want you to notice here jesus doesn't call them fools for not believing all that god has spoken but you'll never understand the mechanics and the dynamics that is our subtitle today the mechanics and the dynamics one more scripture matthew 11. 12-13 and it reads like this and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent they take it by foreign amen may god add his blessings to the reading of his word this morning i'm really hot and embarrassed you may be seated is it warm up here is it me it's warm huh okay you just turned them off all right well i understand we're gonna make everybody happy the other day we're so hot and most people sometimes look at that as a as a negative a negative words one that forces the issue it is somebody that is energetic okay do we have anybody here that's that is a forcer okay anybody here a lot of people aren't just kick back they take it by force those of you that know the scriptures you know that the word that they take it by force is the same greek word that means cut away what is this force that it is talking about it comes to our understanding of knowing that this force is the mechanics and the dynamics you can put up there the the two words mechanics but put mechanics first just for you to to as we settle into this message mechanics is the machinery or the working parts of something is because everything that there is it's always there is and we want to really hit the word the machinery interesting all it's the practicalities or details of something practical now the dynamics now on the other hand they go together you can't find that but the dynamics is the branch of mechanics or the dynamics then is also would be known as the forces which stimulate growth development or change within a system or process but you get that our whole future rests we many times we think about mechanics and dynamics which is the best mechanical dynamics and we we say it and we go through it and all the mechanics and the dynamics but but we have to really get what it is and what he's talking about because as human beings whenever we think about the mechanics of something we always think about all the parts the steps into making something into accomplishing something into fixing something we think about how people or things function and how we can better ourselves or our relationships by following steps for the plan that's laid out i don't know about you but i i fall into that category anybody you you you get you open up a box there's a lot of pieces and it seems like when you finish building it and next thing you know what the thing is falling apart that's what that was for oh if you walk into a bookstore do you like going to bookstores so you start to read it that's kind of hard if you see what if i just do five of them no it says seven steps this is yeti we read about a quarter of the book and i'll get to that later we lose interest 10 ways to improve all your relationships i don't have a good relationship with this member of my family familiar thank goodness nobody here feels that way five habits of highly successful people i don't know those are books i'm just you you understand what i'm doing 12 steps to financial freedom man a way of making ourselves more successes we all go through that anybody ever ever order books online in linea uh i i i i'm having a heart and i gotta believe in you as much you got to believe you come and you get these infomercials it is going to change your way of of your your way of life [Music] oh i got a few people the rest of you just whatever we spent a lot of money to change our status but but as we were hearing such a good message on on wednesday you know we don't want to put the work in to get us to that level and then when we get to that level there's there's we heard about so it's so true because it pertains to all of us you see that has become our tendency nowadays brian fix our finances to try and fix our characters that's why when we're trying to repair or fix some repair we must take this into consideration there is no such a thing as a broken marriage hello everybody there's no such a thing as a broken relationship what's broken are the people in the marriage hello everybody what's broken is not a relationship it's the people in the relationship yes sir yes you'll see do i got your attention this morning there's no such a thing as bad finances oh yeah my finances are are they're just bad the person handling the finances that needs the help you can get the person taken care of care of the other things now what are all these books and podcasts and shows and everything what are they for they're trying to take the undisciplined person and help them some way to become disciplined areas of their lives that are out of control whenever when there's when there's problems something's the more one sees how undisciplined we as human beings are in many areas of our life we have no mechanics much less dynamic mechanical mucho menos everybody wants not the mechanics everybody wants the dynamics how to watch movie after movies hello everybody we've taught them how to watch video games or play video games they know how to plan vacations how to make money how to cheat the system but how about how to pray how to give god the preeminence do we sit down with our children and teach them that how to make christ the word the center of our lives i'm hearing the young man brother aj he's singing that song which is what's broken is the person and why are they broken because the mechanics has not been properly placed or installed we don't know we've never taught them how to be a good husband or good wife when they get married how to respect each other how to help your fellow brothers how can you let me just stop there [Music] but i'm talking about the whole plan the process we face educational machines we face medical machines we face corporate machines and they're all there were people that were experts in mechanics in mechanica let's take for instance the pharisees described the herodians they were experts in the law [Music] however those 10 steps to make it to heaven and i guarantee you so many people would get mucha gente she doing okay i guarantee you it would have been 10 steps to make it to heaven 10 ways but then comes a man out of nowhere and challenges the machine challenges them to the coretta and that's what the prophets of all did they stomped out of the wilderness and did what no one in their right mind would do talent challenge the machine i don't want to say that because it'll mess something up i don't want to poke it because then it'll come after us they didn't think like that they just they just opened this prophets never thought that well i lay down my life and i raise my own life you can't do that unless the father permits that watch this is so tremendous why does this unfold it wasn't their mind he made the mistake of trying to mix everything together he said you see where the brother made the error as anyone else is to making an error started dealing with the up and ups we try now watch us now you see the mechanics of their time the law mechanic but they failed to recognize that there were dynamics that went with those mechanics how many knows that satan also works under mechanics and dynamics now watch yeah you can't belong to a system and be sealed with the system yellow connections right and ready to move the mechanics is already there the mechanical gesture or this big machine this is the big system right the machine the way it works they've already got the mechanical system at the end of an organization organization oh they say peace like the u.n the nations are united together the u.n is nothing but a big rubber balloon but there you then this is why jesus is telling those two disciples on the road to emmaus fools it was we've got to get the mechanics right first mechanic in order for the dynamics to work properly these mechanics is mechanicas is god's word and it only comes one way through his prophet matthew four three through four matteo cuatro and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread joseph but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the proud by this now we have to know this jeremiah 15 19. therefore thus saith the lord if thou return then will i bring thee again and thou shalt stand before me and if thou take forth the precious that means an honorable woman the precious from the vile the worthless thou shalt be as mouth of god here's where we're starting to establish the mechanics and the dynamics notice this now what came forth from the mouth of god was the spoken word [Applause] for shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled only written words have jots and tittles solo la palabrasigota they have absolute and complete authority absolutely matthew 4 jesus you don't have to turn to it but jesus tells satan three times this is the amazing part to me watch what jesus uses for his defense okay the same one get this church the same one that spoke from heaven now begins to quote the prophet who spoke from the earth i like that one that's good stuff here i'm going to say it again that had previously spoken from heaven begins to quote the prophets you were speaking from earth and even how is it that humans throughout the ages knowing that they were the ultimate those words were the ultimate authorities now the only way that a prophet's words have complete authority was now he can't say his own thoughts he can only speak what god reveals it's a thing that god does you can't say nothing else he says because those prophets they were born he will therefore i have made we've gone through this before in one of our other messages but we're getting into something oh what must i do okay see moses expressingly is fully human nature but watch he wanted to wait on thus saith the lord he should have known interview that the very [Applause] don't ah but i it was the mystery that god unfolds it's not a man it's god it's yours the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of god means the the reflector isn't the reflection either reflection there has to be something strike the reflector or the prophet to make it reflect so a prophet is a chosen vessel the image of christ the word you are reflected tell your neighbor that neighborhood [Music] he says god's perfect reflector in type when god was through with him he just when we look at mechanics and dynamics sometimes we just look at them as separate but watch what happens okay you jesus jesus christ they jump and shout they don't get nothing you don't receive another why they get an emotion oh that was a wonderful service and they lived the same way what here's where the problem is in the churches once again the dynamics the power the movement the excitement and therefore the mechanics are never established in a personal they're reflecting their own ideas well i think you're already off to work yes [Music] me did you just hear the voice of a man you get into the word oh we're getting good on getting good on this mechanics and dynamics that teaches you all this theology is the word the mechanic dynamics is the spirit makes the world live make it alive not enough just to have mechanics without dynamics dynamics without mechanics and it's not enough anymore to say i have dynamics and mechanics but now we are in the final leg we are in the home stretch mechanics we must now become right now but there has got to come one hallelujah hallelujah there has to come a real bride who this is not just any anybody there must oh my goodness but the dynamics of it until we come to the place and until we get there yes what good does it do to polish the hubs or the rims of the car they can vienna that's right i'm doing good this morning no matter how much the mechanics proved to be right there's got to be dynamics to make it work that's what easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was god himself in the grave [Music] he was not only they can only the spirit of him and the spiritual there and the flesh of him and put it together did you get it the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together you're just cranking around the pistons you got the spark there to fire it but you have no gasoline to fire it that's the resurrection we know this by heart this is and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up our passover shall we ever be with the lord now i'm going to throw you a little curveball here i'm not saying that it's not that horrendous let me understand what this is my point against anybody that says raptures to take by forces but i want to go a step further i'm not saying that she is not taken by foreign but my question is how is she taken by forces because if usually if somebody is taken by forces there was a force that caught us the [Applause] both i'm going to say it again until that shirt what church polyglycia i want to be part of that until that it's not good enough to have it [Music] that's the true power of the resurrection the dynamics of this church la ninamica destiglacia will be the refilling of the holy ghost that we have worked in a small measure we don't know how he's he calls his body the machine oh my goodness i'm sorry i got i got it [Applause] you crossed over and had some grapes i can't get too much wine up here for the minister to get too much wine and overdo because the force gets worse and worse this is we find out that the mechanics was so [Music] in mechanics the only way to worship him that there's the gate of worship worshiping in spirit and in truth mechanics and dynamics if the spirit dynamics got jesus from the dead then dwells in you it will also quicken them [Music] but i just want to go just for a little bit force is the physical power or strength possessed by a living being strength or power that is exerted upon an object intensity intensity power to influence the influence to affect or control mental or moral strength mental or stability that men that are led by the spirit of god they can't understand their own selves how many here are led by the spirit bring it all together they're driven by a force that sometimes they think why did i ever do that but it's god working in them yet they both work in the same church honestly and they're both an unseen foreign saiyan runs his kingdom by force [Music] why this why me and he says why christ because he said jorah but the prophet said watch this now the gentile age ushered in that way with a forced religion and it'll go out the same way you see that's what sickness is it's an unseen force it's not a force what it's doing the bible says lay your hands on the sick your unbelief will restore it again and the devil can only be one place at a time brother brown says his imps imps are little devils they doesn't mean that he is everywhere god's power [Music] he wants none what is the most vital power or force the most vital force on planet earth we his prayers come on you want 10 ways to have a successful life yes i can barely handle one way lord haruna i don't know about you but man you studies you got to remember all those things thank god for my wife did you take your vitamins today i didn't even know i had vitamins thank you for telling me reminding me that god ever gave put in the hand of mankind prayer they can even change the mind of god there's not another force on earth no matter what kind of gifts it is what is [Music] i love your neighbor i'll mess with you love your enemies the supernatural come on the scene when the holy spirit comes into your heart and produces the fruit of the spirit it produces fruit i never said fruits of the spirit well it's the fruit it's fruit of the spirit that's the force that satan can't handle jesus christ coming back on the worst it brings an excitement to that spirit that's why we as ministers we want to preach with all the forces and all the forces not how behind that's why our dominion is the dominion over sin it is enforced through the power of the police that is in the spirit of christ brother branham can you put up the the picture of brother branham with the halo he said brother branham you hold mono branham you'll probably be dead and gone before this picture comes into a force wow i read that and i said yes in a force right now because the testament but when it comes into a force mechanics and dynamics coming to the body of christ how in force are the only ones god but that's okay but i want i want to just get this last part we have a right to force the most claims so now we have a right to force and it was saying forces things force we now have a right to force it upon him and say give it back and he [Music] the lord the law it'll be in full force scan to your features [Applause] now get this last part we know the vision doesn't fail i want to bring this last part to you we know the vision does not fail and when there's a vision we can take the vision no if he gave me a vision brother brahm says and tell this woman something to do i believe then if i laid my hands upon her she'll get it but what if he didn't give you a vision what would the vision do the vision only gives us faith [Music] the unseen power of god if every one of you died you'd never see your yourself leave your body your [Music] the force that would it would i believe that she's going to get well because i saw the vision and my confidence is in the vision but what about the word lay hands on her it's the same thing when i miss my without the vision it's going to work the same thing as long as your faith is in that word some people are given great faith i don't have that kind of faith they're giving visions and giving them to give them favors [Music] when the perfect [Music] but can you just take the word can you just believe brother james say my wife is coming home you take that and with what you struggle with mariah lucha you believe that it won't bother you no more faith in that then your healing is right there we don't have to look anywhere else i don't need something jesus he said [Music] oh lord jesus this presence that moves around but essentially [Music] all things are possible [Music] so [Music] the mechanics and the dynamics [Music] i thank you for your love portugal thank god for all that you do lord and the spirit lord that has activated you have no be free you are free this morning esta all things are possible todd oh father thank you lord gracias or i know there's a releasing going on right now because your word has gone forth and it cannot come back how many hearts has it received has received oh yes we must become the dynamics
