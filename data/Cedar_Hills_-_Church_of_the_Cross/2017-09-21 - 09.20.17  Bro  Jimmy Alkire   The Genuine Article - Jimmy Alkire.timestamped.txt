[1:33:24] and it
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:36] god bless you this evening
[1:33:40] it's a privilege this evening because I
[1:33:44] have my son here and it's for me it's
[1:33:48] been a long time coming you know it was
[1:33:55] kind of maybe pushing the issue with him
[1:33:59] you know I kind of asked him the
[1:34:01] questions here and there and and talents
[1:34:05] a certain things and his mom would say
[1:34:07] certain things and even his grandma
[1:34:10] would say you know I thought to me this
[1:34:12] was gonna be your day and and finally I
[1:34:15] realized it's got to come from him you
[1:34:21] know he's he's got to be the one to do
[1:34:23] it I wanted it so much because he's my
[1:34:26] son but not only was he my son I see him
[1:34:32] every day
[1:34:33] and you see him every day but I see him
[1:34:36] differently
[1:34:38] because he's my son and he had the exact
[1:34:42] same mannerisms that I did and when as
[1:34:46] when I was his age I can I seen the
[1:34:50] things that I did and I can see the
[1:34:52] exact same things that maybe he probably
[1:34:55] wanted to do and I said Lord you got to
[1:34:59] get a hold of him now you got to get a
[1:35:01] hold of him now but the scripture says
[1:35:04] it's not me leading him but it's the
[1:35:08] Holy Ghost in his time when he wants no
[1:35:11] man cometh to me unless I bring him and
[1:35:15] tonight is his time from the foundation
[1:35:18] of the world
[1:35:19] this was his time this evening
[1:35:24] so so his walk is just beginning and
[1:35:31] this is the first step and after this
[1:35:37] the devil's gonna start to get out of
[1:35:39] bed for you son he's gonna come after
[1:35:43] you he's gonna come after you hard and
[1:35:47] that's when you really gotta grab ahold
[1:35:50] of it now because it's a baptism after
[1:35:53] baptism daily just read the word study
[1:35:56] get just and put the world the things of
[1:35:59] this world aside because once we get to
[1:36:04] that point and we have escaped that
[1:36:06] corruption and we have obtained that
[1:36:10] like precious faith so we're gonna we're
[1:36:13] gonna pray for him this this evening
[1:36:15] this bar heads Lord gracious Heavenly
[1:36:19] Father Lord we come before you this
