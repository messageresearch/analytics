[22:35] [Music]
[22:37] this time we're gonna ask our brother
[22:39] Julian to to come and uh give his home
[23:01] God bless you everybody
[23:04] it is good to see you all yes
[23:08] and all your beautiful faces this is
[23:12] the most good-looking family I've ever
[23:15] seen
[23:17] you're welcome I don't know why I just
[23:19] want to say that I'm sorry
[23:22] uh I want
[23:25] I want to get right into
[23:27] this Poe today is
[23:32] um as you all know we've been doing the
[23:34] text all things natural
[23:36] is
[23:40] a sonnet of Supernatural Poetics
[23:45] and the poem today
[23:48] uh has a couple of themes and I'm going
[23:51] to give them to you real quick
[23:54] so remember oceans natural versus the
[23:58] spiritual recorded
[24:00] versus
[24:01] or typing this natural type in the
[24:04] spiritual
[24:06] uh Peter typing the believer is Christ
[24:10] types
[24:14] Christo the oceans of man Inward and
[24:17] outwarda
[24:21] um the subjects of Terror versus
[24:24] salvation
[24:28] and shredding the waters
[24:32] real quick before we go forward
[24:35] I wanted to define the word Terror
[24:37] because it's kind of a nasty word
[24:42] uh in the dictionary Terror just means
[24:45] extreme fear in the dictionary
[24:49] um
[24:53] and you might think well terror is like
[24:56] horror which is mostly what they're
[24:58] associated with
[25:03] a terror is slightly worse
[25:07] because the difference is
[25:11] horror would be if you were swimming in
[25:12] the ocean and you saw a shark
[25:18] and Terror would be if you're swimming
[25:20] in the ocean and you knew there was a
[25:22] shark
[25:27] but you couldn't see it
[25:29] those are the differences
[25:34] but uh it's important to know
[25:37] don't worry salvation is coming
[25:42] so this poem is titled Oceans Deep where
[25:45] men must start
[25:52] in pessamos
[25:54] how deep does our ocean go get them
[25:58] what Terrors does it hide
[26:01] what is it we are pulling in
[26:05] what Darkness eats our lights
[26:09] Jesus walked to tumult sea Jesus
[26:15] in the midst of storm in Medio de la
[26:18] tormenta Peter watched and saw this man
[26:22] forever called the Lord
[26:27] though Christ gave Pete one command
[26:33] to look only to him
[26:36] he walked upon the massive Pond
[26:41] the reservoir Greg
[26:46] he looked into the depths below
[26:50] the depths look back at him
[26:55] swallowing him in a
[26:58] momento his odds grew ever
[27:01] slimes
[27:03] the Lord reached with his mighty hand El
[27:06] Senora Largo supo de rosamano and pulled
[27:09] Pete from the waters
[27:12] hands had gripped his ankles firm
[27:15] susmanos
[27:17] confirmeza to pull him miles under
[27:20] butas the social here we call by name is
[27:26] the sea of man is
[27:30] wonders tempt us to the depths
[27:34] they tempt us to our end nostient
[27:38] human creatures claw our ankles
[27:52] are made with ill attempts
[27:56] careful not to look from
[28:01] Christo or soon you will be swept
[28:05] every tear that falls in here
[28:09] this Abyss has kept is
[28:13] oh fear not little flock who walks the
[28:16] top of the water
[28:20] though the storm may thrash and well
[28:25] our Lord will never falter nuestro
[28:29] Senora if you are to sink and fail
[28:34] no God hath planned your
[28:37] doubted
[28:39] know that Jesus doth remember
[28:44] to you he will reach out yet
[28:49] [Applause]

[34:29] yes it was his grace
[34:33] hey man so I I didn't tell brother Isaac
[34:36] to sing that song
[34:39] but it goes right in line with what
[34:42] we're going to speak tonight
[34:46] so uh so we're not standing too long
[34:52] um God bless you all this evening
[34:56] thank you God bless you to our pastor
[34:58] for the confidence tonight
[35:02] and let's read our scripture right away
[35:04] so we can take our seats
[35:11] and what's going to be found in Matthew
[35:13] 27
[35:15] verse 62 Mateo versus
[35:21] and when you have it you can say amen
[35:23] amen now the next day that followed the
[35:27] day of the preparation the chief priests
[35:29] and Pharisees came together into pilate
[35:30] saying sir we remember that
[35:33] that deceiver said while he was yet
[35:36] alive after three days I will rise again
[35:50] foreign
[35:54] command therefore that the Sepulcher be
[35:56] made sure until the third day lest his
[35:59] disciples come by night and steal him
[36:00] away
[36:01] and say unto the people he has risen
[36:04] from the dead so the last Heir shall be
[36:06] worse than the first is
[36:20] pilate said unto them ye have a watch
[36:23] go your way make it as sure as you can
[36:25] so they went and made the Sepulcher sure
[36:28] sealing the stone and setting a watch
[36:45] amen you can be seated and may God add
[36:48] His blessings for the reading of the
[36:49] word
[36:52] so they wanted to make sure
[36:55] that they were guarding the Rock Amen
[37:01] they rolled a great Stone over the tomb
[37:05] and they set forth guards guardes who
[37:10] guard the
[37:12] Rocka but what they didn't realize
[37:16] what's that they were guarding a
[37:19] Rocka beneath the rock the
[37:25] had already testified
[37:28] that in three days
[37:31] I'll rise up again
[37:35] what a Rock Amen
[37:37] so I started thinking about this
[37:41] and this is no no lie
[37:44] and so as I got home last night
[37:47] I had already been thinking about it
[37:51] and uh so last night I was I was working
[37:54] at home
[37:56] and I usually go out to my horse Corrals
[38:02] and I stay about an hour out there
[38:05] yeah and usually that's where I speak to
[38:07] the Lord
[38:10] and so I was I was raking
[38:14] I was I was cleaning up horse manure
[38:17] this is
[38:18] [Music]
[38:19] and I was thinking you know everybody
[38:21] wants to be a
[38:24] Cowboys so it's time to do cowboys
[38:31] all right see and so I was there raking
[38:35] raking up some stuff
[38:37] and the Lord said you're going to speak
[38:39] on the Rock yes
[38:43] and I said I'm going to speak on the
[38:45] Rock
[38:48] you're going to speak on the Rocka
[38:52] I said well I don't know about that um
[38:57] I pretty much already got the schedule
[38:59] down
[39:03] maybe it'll be after the new year
[39:08] and so I'll get ready to speak on the
[39:11] Rock
[39:13] and the Lord said again You're Going to
[39:16] speak on the Rock yes
[39:19] and no sooner than I heard that again
[39:25] the phone rings and I looked at my phone
[39:29] and I was fumbling it around
[39:33] and it said pastor pastor I said man
[39:37] what a coincidence
[39:40] this is pretty coincidental
[39:45] I said I thought to myself
[39:48] no he ain't calling for me to speak no
[39:51] no no no no no
[39:53] I think I just heard that we're all
[39:55] preached out yeah
[39:58] all right so so I answered the phone and
[40:00] he says hey
[40:02] how you doing I said oh pretty good how
[40:06] about you yeah he says let me call you
[40:08] back
[40:11] okay well maybe that means it's going to
[40:12] be like a little lengthier conversation
[40:14] maybe yeah
[40:17] maybe go over a couple things that we
[40:19] had already talked about us
[40:23] and he calls me right back
[40:26] he says uh how do you feel about
[40:28] speaking tomorrow
[40:32] oh I had already known the Lord had
[40:34] already spoken
[40:37] and my lord said unto the and the Lord
[40:40] said unto my Lord
[40:41] and so here we are on the Rock Amen
[40:45] now I started thinking the other day
[40:49] I started to get a little
[40:51] um I was kind of thinking you know kind
[40:54] of like how we do
[40:57] and I started thinking over the years
[41:02] that's something that I think about
[41:04] pretty often
[41:06] I always think about the the first time
[41:09] that I ever went to church
[41:12] and then I start to think about that and
[41:15] I think man what up I know I mean what a
[41:18] what a what a
[41:20] it's unbelievable
[41:25] and then I think about how we came from
[41:28] from you know when I when I first came
[41:31] to church one time it was it was just me
[41:33] my dad and my sisters
[41:39] and so then and then I think about those
[41:41] times and as we got older and older and
[41:43] I you start thinking oh man all the
[41:45] years are passing by so fast
[41:52] and I think well man those days are gone
[41:58] I start looking around and thinking
[42:00] about the people that were there in
[42:01] church
[42:04] and then I think about our founding
[42:06] Pastor I said
[42:08] and I think man those days are going and
[42:10] they're gone they're gone and they're
[42:12] going fast
[42:16] and so
[42:18] you start to think a little bit or I do
[42:20] anyways
[42:23] you think I start to think well look how
[42:25] far I've come oh
[42:30] yeah look how far I've made it
[42:37] and I man I made it this far
[42:41] right look and I look at my family Bill
[42:44] me Familia I think man
[42:46] the stand that I made yeah
[42:50] all right look at look at I'm so blessed
[42:54] when all of a sudden the Lord says
[43:01] it was me the whole time
[43:04] it was God by his grace
[43:09] when I couldn't even stand
[43:12] that was him that was holding me up
[43:15] he has become My Life Source
[43:19] he has become everything to me
[43:22] is everything that I am
[43:25] he has been my wrong
[43:27] he has been my rock in a weary place
[43:32] now when you play football
[43:35] right they call that The Rock
[43:38] right hand me off the rock right that's
[43:43] the one the line when the running back
[43:45] regrets the football because
[43:49] the one thing that he has to do
[43:52] he can be fast
[43:57] right but he's got to guard the wrong
[44:01] right he's got to guard that football is
[44:04] because his adversary
[44:07] he's trying to take the ball away from
[44:09] him
[44:11] right so that's what they call the Rock
[44:13] is
[44:14] so they use the same term in basketball
[44:17] right
[44:19] you got a guard basketball
[44:23] [Music]
[44:26] you got a guard it right
[44:28] and so now as we approach the new year
[44:33] we want to be sure tonight
[44:37] you know because like I said
[44:40] it was God all the time
[44:43] God did it if you're here tonight
[44:47] God did it if you have anything tonight
[44:52] God did it if you have a good job
[44:56] tonight
[44:59] it was God the whole time foreign
[45:20] [Music]
[46:55] A man jumped out of the bushes
[47:00] said oh what are you doing
[47:02] and she says I'm praising God because I
[47:06] was praying to him
[47:08] that I needed food
[47:10] and he heard my prayers
[47:13] and now I have a bunch of food
[47:16] God did it and he said no God didn't do
[47:20] it
[47:21] because I'm an atheist
[47:23] I don't believe in God he said yesterday
[47:27] I was cleaning the side of my house
[47:31] and I heard you praying
[47:34] and I heard that you needed some food
[47:37] he said so stop your worshiping
[47:41] don't praise them
[47:44] you're praising the wrong God
[47:48] says I went to the store
[47:51] I got my credit card
[47:54] and I bought you all these groceries
[47:59] God did it
[48:08] he says I am an atheist
[48:12] I heard you praying
[48:15] I went to the store we are at the end
[48:17] got the groceries put them in my car
[48:20] put them on your porch
[48:23] and I ring the doorbell
[48:26] and she said no sir God did it
[48:30] says you don't understand
[48:33] he says I did it no no no no no God did
[48:37] it
[48:38] he said I did it she said no God did it
[48:43] God heard my prayers
[48:45] that I needed food
[48:48] and God did it and he let the devil pay
[48:52] for it
[48:54] it was God who did it amen
[48:58] now that's the attitude that we have to
[49:00] have
[49:02] it was God who did it
[49:05] it was God who has brought us this far
[49:08] with music you know it was God who was
[49:11] the rock
[49:12] the Bible says that he is
[49:18] salvation he is my Refugee
[49:21] who is there none like God
[49:25] there is none like him tonight
[49:28] God did it and I thank God
[49:41] save me yes
[49:53] we see here
[49:57] now David was a man
[50:00] the Bible says he was a man of Praise
[50:06] And so David
[50:09] he would write songs like that
[50:13] he was right like the Lord is my refuge
[50:16] is
[50:18] the Lord is my strength
[50:21] and we find out here you know I wanna I
[50:25] wanna read something that brother
[50:26] Brandon says
[50:28] and brother Brandon says this in the new
[50:30] year
[50:32] right and so he says now
[50:35] now Heavenly Father his brain
[50:39] and he's talking about the new year and
[50:41] he says Heavenly fathers we stand here
[50:44] [Music]
[50:46] as many thoughts as dying out in our
[50:49] hearts

[53:03] raise up mighty Manos
[53:09] that raise up mighty men
[53:12] that was his prayer
[53:14] and why the controversy now
[53:19] why the controversy
[53:21] the prophet of God is
[53:24] praying to God
[53:26] and God answers his prayers
[53:30] and Men become a scandal and it becomes
[53:34] so he says raise up mighty man

[53:44] openness
[53:47] Lord that hidden man
[53:49] Escondido the Rocka
[53:55] he's dead
[53:57] let me say that again
[53:59] he said Lord he says open this year
[54:04] that hidden man let's say my nice
[54:07] candido the Rocka beneath
[54:11] that we might see the program of God
[54:21] Lord put the Capstone
[54:24] Christ Jesus upon each and every one of
[54:28] us
[54:28] may his great magnificent holy blessings
[54:32] be upon us all guesses
[54:43] May the power
[54:45] of the Resurrection
[54:48] come upon us that's not what he says he
[54:53] says
[54:57] foreign
[55:16] [Applause]
[55:49] [Music]
[55:56] and uh
[56:02] and so you know he had to go he couldn't
[56:04] uh all the soldiers were crying
[56:09] and so uh he went with the with a
[56:13] soldier
[56:15] and so so when he got to this certain
[56:18] place
[56:20] uh God drew his attention to Iraq deals
[56:25] and he says uh go to The Rock
[56:28] he says why does he want me to go to the
[56:31] Rock
[56:32] right and he says get closer to the Rock
[56:37] right and so as he gets closer to the
[56:40] Rock
[56:41] so everything else
[56:43] because of the gases
[56:45] the the grass the weeds the trees
[56:51] they died
[56:53] right and so so he says get closer to
[56:57] the
[56:58] Rocka and he says now pick up the
[57:01] Rocka and so he picks up the Rock
[57:04] and underneath the rock
[57:06] was the Easter lily
[57:11] you've heard the story right
[57:13] you've read the story right so he says
[57:17] there there was an Easter lilians
[57:22] it had life inside of it and that life
[57:28] because it was underneath
[57:35] because of the gases
[57:39] underneath the Rocks
[57:42] Jesus is the rock okay God is
[57:46] in Isaiah 42 11 in is
[57:51] it's this decent
[57:56] let the Wilderness and the cities
[57:59] thereof lift up their voice
[58:03] foreign
[58:52] [Music]
[59:08] I went to another
[59:10] level of thing
[59:12] I didn't even know I could sing like
[59:14] that
[59:16] but then I went to another level
[59:21] oh my pain was gone
[59:34] Montana
[59:40] now I always say
[59:43] I am not gonna
[59:45] be the way I preach
[59:48] I'm gonna be cool next time
[59:51] I want to be like that guy yeah
[59:56] he's just monotone
[1:00:00] [Music]
[1:00:02] right
[1:00:05] but you know what let us have a kid let
[1:00:08] the inhabitants of the rock sing que
[1:00:10] losses
[1:00:12] I just can't help it
[1:00:14] that's the way it made me
[1:00:18] because he has been my rocks
[1:00:21] he has been there with me
[1:00:28] that's my rock it's a miraca now
[1:00:32] hold up now one day Jesus asked the
[1:00:36] question Jesus you know because as we
[1:00:39] heard beautifully Illustrated
[1:00:43] that Jesus had been hearing about what
[1:00:45] people were talking about
[1:00:48] Orlando right and so he asked the
[1:00:51] question
[1:00:53] he said
[1:00:56] who do men say that I am this is
[1:01:02] well the disciples were also they had
[1:01:05] heard around the city
[1:01:08] so they began to say well some say that
[1:01:10] you're Elias
[1:01:14] one of the prophets right and so so
[1:01:19] he personally directed them
[1:01:23] and he said to Peter Pedro he said but
[1:01:26] who do you say that I am this is
[1:01:30] who do you say that I am yeah
[1:01:33] and you know Peter
[1:01:36] Peter was bold
[1:01:38] Peter was both somebody was talking
[1:01:41] about Peter the other day
[1:01:43] I said man that's going to be a real
[1:01:45] awkward conversation for you
[1:01:50] when you get over there and you gotta
[1:01:53] face Peter you said
[1:01:55] the stuff that you were saying about
[1:01:57] Peter
[1:01:58] that's going to be real awkward right
[1:02:02] Peter was Bold
[1:02:05] And he says you know what is that okay
[1:02:07] I'm just gonna say it well I'm gonna I'm
[1:02:10] gonna say maybe it might not even be
[1:02:12] right boys
[1:02:19] foreign
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:03:16] saroka
[1:03:33] [Applause]
[1:03:39] right correct but we always like to look
[1:03:42] at Peter
[1:04:10] because it was already predestinated
[1:04:13] that kind of reminds me of how one
[1:04:15] brother Brandon went across the curtain
[1:04:17] of time
[1:04:20] now will I be judged like well you know
[1:04:24] because they said you'll be judged
[1:04:27] and you're the people that believe your
[1:04:29] message or you preached to will be
[1:04:31] judged according to which is
[1:04:43] will Paul be judged
[1:04:45] yes all will be judged and they'll be
[1:04:48] judged according to what Paul brothers
[1:04:53] and he said
[1:04:56] well then I preached for Paul praying
[1:05:00] I preached
[1:05:03] that's not so much what gets it is
[1:05:15] Cried Out Clamato we are resting on that
[1:05:20] I wasn't even born
[1:05:23] I wasn't even born when he went across
[1:05:25] the corner of time
[1:05:29] but I believe I was one of the Millions
[1:05:45] foreign
[1:06:05] you want to make sure that you
[1:06:08] have the Rocks
[1:06:11] you want to guide your rock
[1:06:15] Uno
[1:06:24] foreign
[1:06:34] and this is Brother Branham uses this
[1:06:37] scripture
[1:06:39] the message shalom
[1:06:41] I mean Shalom right and he also
[1:06:43] references Isaiah
[1:06:45] and he says arise and arise and shine
[1:06:48] for your life has come right
[1:06:53] in in Gross darkness
[1:06:56] and then brother Brandon begins to say
[1:06:58] you know like we're living in a time of
[1:07:00] gross darkness
[1:07:03] and then he reads is uh Psalms 62
[1:07:08] and then he says these two scriptures
[1:07:10] are totally contrast
[1:07:15] but he says now we're living in dark
[1:07:18] times
[1:07:21] you go home and read that message
[1:07:24] because if I repeat what brother Brown
[1:07:26] says
[1:07:28] somebody's going to say
[1:07:30] right oh he's throwing at me
[1:07:37] all right because some of us do what
[1:07:41] brother Brown same here
[1:07:45] okay we're not going to read it you read
[1:07:47] it at home
[1:07:49] and so he's talking about
[1:07:51] women
[1:07:53] oh they want to put the pants
[1:07:59] he starts talking about the man
[1:08:02] just aren't Burly anymore
[1:08:05] not Burly they're not manly yeah
[1:08:09] they want to wear certain things
[1:08:12] I won't repeat because you're going to
[1:08:16] look at somebody and say oh
[1:08:21] it'll give you a reason to go read it
[1:08:24] okay so he says he says so we're living
[1:08:27] in Gross Darkness
[1:08:30] we're living in dark times
[1:08:33] but that's why I wanted to read this
[1:08:36] scripture foreign
[1:08:42] yes
[1:08:47] right
[1:08:49] why are we always it's so dark
[1:08:53] oh it's so evil oh
[1:08:56] man look at these videos
[1:08:59] they're evil
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:05] oh man they're Evil Dead
[1:09:11] dangerous
[1:09:14] Danger
[1:09:17] right
[1:09:19] that's the way we are
[1:09:21] right and so brother Brown says Shalom
[1:09:25] peace
[1:09:29] trolling my soul waiters upon God for
[1:09:33] him cometh my salvation
[1:09:38] he only is my rock and my salvation
[1:09:43] no David found himself
[1:09:46] one day David
[1:09:49] mighty warrior of God
[1:09:54] is
[1:09:56] he was hiding in a
[1:09:59] Rocka right and the Bible says that one
[1:10:03] day fall who was his adversary
[1:10:06] was looking to kill him
[1:10:09] right and he went into the same cave
[1:10:11] where David was
[1:10:14] now there's a great lesson in that too
[1:10:17] so if you want to go read that story
[1:10:21] right David went and cut off
[1:10:36] but the Lord
[1:10:38] got a hold of David right
[1:10:40] and David David
[1:10:44] said that that's God's anointed
[1:10:47] right A Dream David that he had done
[1:10:50] that the grief David that he had done
[1:10:52] that
[1:10:54] choice right and so so David found
[1:10:57] himself in this cave
[1:11:01] but David knew
[1:11:04] that the cave wasn't his security
[1:11:08] The Rock wasn't his security
[1:11:11] he said he only is my rock in my city
[1:11:16] David knew that God had done it
[1:11:20] David knew David that God was his
[1:11:24] protection
[1:11:27] that his job was in his rock
[1:11:30] that his job was in his Rock
[1:11:55] he alone
[1:12:00] it is
[1:12:48] was nothing in the basket
[1:12:51] he looked in there and he he was he was
[1:12:54] about to get up at the pulpit
[1:12:57] he was about to blast
[1:13:00] the congregation
[1:13:02] yeah I had bills that I needed to pay uh
[1:13:06] they didn't even bring Tyler off
[1:13:10] when all of a sudden God stopped him
[1:13:12] they repented and he said they are not
[1:13:15] your Source
[1:13:19] they're a resource
[1:13:22] I am the source
[1:13:25] right so God tonight
[1:13:29] he is your source
[1:13:34] he only is my rock and my salvation
[1:13:37] he is my defense
[1:13:38] I shall not be greatly moved
[1:13:45] now how did David get to this place
[1:13:49] uh here's a boy can you imagine this
[1:13:53] well
[1:13:55] right imagine this scene
[1:13:58] we've said it many times
[1:14:02] right
[1:14:05] and then here's this um little old
[1:14:07] brother Branham says ready
[1:14:15] little Ruddy fellow muchachito okay and
[1:14:20] so can you imagine this
[1:14:22] here he comes and he says uh who's this
[1:14:27] uncircumcised Philistine
[1:14:29] is
[1:14:31] challenging the armies of the Living God
[1:14:39] stand up
[1:14:43] this is the conversation
[1:14:46] this guy right here
[1:14:50] he says who's that giant over there
[1:14:53] who's been following the
[1:14:56] armies of the Living God
[1:15:01] I just wanted them to get out
[1:15:03] a visual of the size
[1:15:08] and so he says uh well look at him we
[1:15:14] didn't know
[1:15:18] he says you know I'll go fight him
[1:15:27] what makes you think that you can go
[1:15:29] fight that giant
[1:15:33] well one day I was in the field just
[1:15:37] only Campo and I was watching my
[1:15:38] father's sheep is
[1:15:43] you don't you don't you're not capturing
[1:15:46] it
[1:15:48] he said a Lion King
[1:15:50] Leon you're you're not getting it I was
[1:15:55] hunting me and my wife
[1:15:57] and javelina you know how Alina was
[1:16:00] coming down the same Trail we were
[1:16:01] coming down
[1:16:03] right and they don't have good eyesight
[1:16:05] you know cause I'm like does he see me
[1:16:08] or is he charging me
[1:16:13] this was the javelina javelina
[1:16:16] it's big
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:20] so that thing was coming at me is that
[1:16:22] is anybody so I put my bow down
[1:16:26] and I pulled out my pistol it's okay
[1:16:29] that thing makes one more move Charlotte
[1:16:37] right but David said one day I was
[1:16:41] watching my father's sheep
[1:16:44] and a lion king
[1:16:48] [Applause]
[1:16:50] know you you can't fathom that Leon
[1:16:57] what did you do to the lion
[1:16:59] let me ask you again what did you do to
[1:17:02] the lion he says I took that lion out oh
[1:17:08] I flew that lion
[1:17:10] you slow a lion
[1:17:13] they could capture it they could capture
[1:17:16] it they didn't live in big old houses
[1:17:19] that we live in here
[1:17:22] Jungle of uh asphalt right
[1:17:31] because a guy in that time
[1:17:33] a guy in that time he knew if you ran
[1:17:37] into a lion on the trail
[1:17:41] it was pretty much sudden death practice
[1:17:46] he says I slew that lion
[1:17:49] you you killed the lion yeah and one day
[1:17:53] a bear too
[1:17:55] I killed the Big Bear
[1:18:45] give me that old rock
[1:18:53] to me
[1:18:55] that was sent to me by a prophet and I
[1:18:59] received it
[1:19:00] by five stones
[1:19:05] I received it with five Stones
[1:19:07] does that give me something that I know
[1:19:14] in English
[1:19:18] Jesus gave me a password
[1:19:21] Give Me Prophet Prophet us give me
[1:19:23] preach the evangelists
[1:19:26] there is something that I know
[1:19:29] don't give me your new Revelations
[1:19:34] and the Bible says that David went out
[1:19:38] and he took that rock
[1:19:40] he says he took that stone
[1:19:43] and he put it in a slingshot
[1:19:46] right and so he got this Stone
[1:19:51] so before we go there we're going to go
[1:19:54] to Deuteronomy 32 so get that ready
[1:20:00] 32 30 and 31.
[1:20:04] and so David says
[1:20:06] the Bible says that David took his link
[1:20:11] I don't know how many swings he took
[1:20:15] but it won't matter
[1:20:18] right right it wouldn't matter no
[1:20:21] important it doesn't matter if you if
[1:20:23] you if you take the football
[1:20:26] doesn't matter right if you if you hike
[1:20:30] a football
[1:20:31] is football and how many steps
[1:20:38] if you don't have a NFL alarm
[1:20:44] I'm gonna do you no good right it might
[1:20:47] be good for Junior League
[1:20:51] but it doesn't matter the wind up
[1:20:55] it don't matter if you're pitching and
[1:20:57] you do a big wind up
[1:21:01] if you don't have that wrong
[1:21:08] bye
[1:21:09] I don't know how many swings he took no
[1:21:11] sequence
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:18] maybe five maybe seven
[1:21:22] right maybe seven
[1:21:25] and the Bible says that he flew that
[1:21:29] rock
[1:21:30] he let it go
[1:21:33] crack Goliath School is
[1:21:39] [Music]
[1:21:59] if it was coming out of a gun
[1:22:03] it would have to come out at the speed
[1:22:05] of 1000 feet per second
[1:22:10] one thousand feet per second
[1:22:13] means that that stone significance
[1:22:21] at 688 miles an hour
[1:22:27] that there's not a man alive
[1:22:33] 688 miles per hour
[1:22:37] no let me clarify that clarification 688
[1:22:50] it was a Jesus
[1:22:53] Jesus it was that God that yours was
[1:22:56] David's Rock
[1:22:58] and in verse 31 it says
[1:24:52] foreign Jesus
[1:25:16] how many love the Lord
[1:25:37] say ah
[1:25:39] your rock is not like my rock um
[1:25:44] right
[1:25:45] you're a rock even even your enemies and
[1:25:49] Amigos they know and you'll stop it oh
[1:25:51] they might talk about you oh but they
[1:25:54] know
[1:25:59] this is the Rock of Ages
[1:26:02] it was God with youth indeed it was God
[1:26:07] now the rock is with us tonight
[1:26:14] as we go into the new year
[1:26:20] as brother Brandon was reading that
[1:26:21] prayer
[1:26:28] right and he
[1:26:30] and he uh in closing I want to read this
[1:26:33] yes
[1:26:37] now let us down to our feet now and
[1:26:39] every one of us
[1:26:43] you know there's power in the Rock
[1:26:45] right correct brother Brown says David
[1:26:48] knew it
[1:26:50] David had that power
[1:26:53] right and Samson he said he had that
[1:26:57] power he knew that there was power in
[1:26:59] the Rock
[1:27:01] and so he says the contest is on
[1:27:06] for each one of you Paul said forgetting
[1:27:10] those things that are the or in the past
[1:27:13] all of our mistakes
[1:27:15] last year I pressed towards the mark of

[1:28:27] whatever tomorrow holds I don't know
[1:28:30] but I Know Who Holds 1963.
[1:28:36] we know what happened in 1963.
[1:28:44] all right
[1:28:46] he says whatever holds whatever tomorrow
[1:28:48] holds
[1:28:51] I don't know you're not saying Garden
