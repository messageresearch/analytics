[41:42] you all that are online God bless you
[41:43] yeah
[41:47] it said that Jesus was given the
[41:49] borrowed tomb
[41:51] is
[41:52] Jesus
[41:54] I was giving some borrowed eyes this
[41:56] evening
[42:00] couldn't find no cheaters so I said
[42:02] anybody I ask Emilio do you have
[42:04] cheaters
[42:09] and remember my dad said one time
[42:13] he said uh you know as you get a 40
[42:16] because he had heard what the prophet
[42:18] said right when you turn 40
[42:21] your eyes
[42:27] oh I was about 12 you know
[42:31] I'm like right let's go fly out yeah
[42:35] I don't know about that
[42:38] I can see a gnat on the back of her ear
[42:40] oh yeah right
[42:45] but uh I found out
[42:48] your eyes go flat
[42:50] and every year after they go flatter and
[42:53] flatter so
[42:57] praise the Lord I can see maybe
[43:02] all right so let's turn over in our
[43:04] scriptures
[43:06] and let's read uh John 4
[43:10] Juan capitolo cuatro chapter 10. versus
[43:14] yes
[43:16] and so
[43:18] let's read the scripture real quick and
[43:20] then we'll we'll explain something here
[43:25] so this is Jesus talking to the woman at
[43:27] the well because the Jesus
[43:30] and Jesus answered her
[43:33] and said unto her if thou knewest the
[43:35] gift of God and who it is that saith to
[43:39] thee give me the drink that would would
[43:41] have asked have asked him of him and he
[43:44] would have given the Living Water
[43:46] respond Jesus is
[43:56] amen and if we would skip down to verse
[43:59] 24
[44:01] it says God is a spirit and they that
[44:04] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[44:06] and in truth
[44:12] the woman said unto him I know
[44:18] say Amen you can be seated and may the
[44:22] Lord have his blessings
[44:27] right so she was looking for a messiah
[44:32] right and so she had all this
[44:34] information
[44:36] of what the Messiah was gonna be
[44:40] us right and so when it presented
[44:43] himself to her
[44:46] at first it was a rejection
[44:52] so kind of a strange title right
[44:58] and then a subtitle I know right
[45:03] but it's not in the way that it's
[45:05] written there little noise
[45:07] it's in the way of the way you pronounce
[45:10] it in the tone
[45:13] so it's
[45:15] I know
[45:17] you'll see
[45:18] I know Jose
[45:21] right see the difference yeah so we live
[45:24] in a day and age
[45:26] right so this is an information age
[45:30] and today in the world that we live in
[45:34] everybody knows it all
[45:37] right you can't don't can't say anything
[45:41] right because right away they're gonna
[45:43] fact check
[45:45] they're going to go to Google right away
[45:48] let me find out what it says
[45:51] a lot of information right information
[45:53] correct we have we have a bunch of
[45:55] know-it-alls what we say
[46:01] and even uh when I'm sometimes out
[46:04] working in the yard
[46:06] and Patio I'll tell my granddaughter
[46:09] something
[46:14] says the five-year-old
[46:17] I used to just play with her I said says
[46:19] a three-year-old yes
[46:22] no I'm four no no all right so it's it's
[46:26] that everywhere that we live in the
[46:28] world is
[46:30] you you can't tell people anything right
[46:34] you tell them hey you're supposed to do
[46:36] this and this is
[46:39] right so in my job right
[46:42] I have the opportunity to to be the boss
[46:46] and so you tell people
[46:49] hey don't forget that you need to do
[46:51] this and this and this is
[46:55] and then
[46:58] and you're like
[47:00] I thought they knew
[47:02] right and then it continues the next day
[47:06] hey you forgot yesterday to clean your
[47:09] station
[47:11] don't forget that this is what you need
[47:13] to do
[47:14] oh see you'll see
[47:18] and then they forget right
[47:21] you tell people
[47:23] this is the policy of our uniforms
[47:27] right follow this policy oh I know I
[47:30] know
[47:32] they forget half their uniforms
[47:36] right see so they know everything right
[47:40] and so God says
[47:43] my people perish
[47:45] for the lack of knowledge
[47:48] right but we know it all right
[47:52] so there are things that we must know
[47:56] now there are things that this lie in
[47:59] this life in this Christian walk
[48:02] that you must know
[48:05] so we know that the Bible says
[48:09] You must be born again
[48:13] it's not a it's not a maybe no it's like
[48:16] okay it's not uh possibly
[48:19] that it's must you must be born again
[48:24] right so there's things that we must
[48:27] know
[48:28] and the first thing that we need to know
[48:30] tonight is
[48:33] that I need a savior is
[48:40] Right does that excite you
[48:43] that there is a savior if you're in need
[48:47] of a savior
[48:49] so I need to know
[48:51] that I need a savior
[48:54] the Bible says in Romans 3 23
[48:59] for all have sinned
[49:02] and come short of the glory of God
[49:07] so we are in need of a savior this is
[49:13] that I need to be redeemed
[49:16] in order to be redeemed
[49:20] something has to give up its life right
[49:26] the Bible says
[49:28] that without the shedding of blood
[49:32] there is no remission of sins
[49:35] so in order for there to be life
[49:40] there has to be death
[49:43] something has to give its life
[49:47] and that's a must
[49:50] there's
[49:56] a must for life to come
[50:01] there has to be a death
[50:04] so for in order for you to be sitting
[50:07] here tonight
[50:09] and sitting where you're at today is
[50:13] somebody died
[50:16] we understand that
[50:18] right that somebody died
[50:22] and gave their life
[50:24] just so you can be where you're foreign
[50:53] in a press
[50:55] it was squeezed foreign
[51:04] [Applause]
[52:13] somebody was squeezed
[52:15] somebody was put through the fire again
[52:19] just so that we could be where we're at
[52:21] today
[52:24] and now order
[52:27] everybody
[52:29] they they all believe in God
[52:32] right so we hear it said so many often
[52:35] times
[52:37] nobody has to tell me to raise my hands
[52:42] right we hear it all the time we stay
[52:44] here right nobody has to tell me the
[52:46] song leader don't have to oh
[52:51] when I feel the spirit moving I'll raise
[52:53] my hands
[52:56] problem is that when the spirit is
[53:01] a lot of times
[53:05] because we're not in tune
[53:14] that's why
[53:15] God places
[53:18] worship leaders
[53:21] men that are in tune
[53:24] that when the spirit moves
[53:29] [Music]
[53:40] amen amen
[53:43] not a lot of amens right Menace
[53:47] but pero they're in tune
[53:52] now we all need a savior tonight
[53:56] now I want you to know
[53:58] that Jesus Jesus Is My Savior is me
[54:02] Salvador Jesus loose he died he did that
[54:07] for me
[54:09] Jesus did it Jesus Jesus did everything
[54:15] for me
[54:17] all that Jesus did Jesus was because he
[54:22] loved me
[54:23] that's my Revelation
[54:26] he did it for me for me Jesus Jesus Paid
[54:31] It All Lopez all to him
[54:36] had left the Crimson Stain
[54:40] say that again sin had left a Crimson
[54:42] Stain
[54:43] a mancha Jesus blood hath washed your
[54:47] wife let us know
[54:49] I know I was lost
[54:53] amen you have to know you were lost
[54:58] now I was reading and I like to read
[55:01] these stories
[55:05] that about the average
[55:08] of about 100 to 150 people
[55:13] or 100 to 150 hikers
[55:22] because of lack of preparation
[55:26] lack of knowledge
[55:29] right so I like to read these stories
[55:33] right and and these people is they they
[55:37] go out hiking
[55:40] right they go out for an evening stroll
[55:44] foreign
[55:46] right they they get to a place oh what a
[55:51] beautiful place
[55:52] right and they they just head out on a
[55:54] on a little nightly stroll he's telling
[55:56] us
[55:57] and they die because they were not
[56:01] prepared
[56:02] and it's always asked well what happened
[56:06] well they went out with their sandals
[56:10] and they were just hiking up in the
[56:12] rocks
[56:14] and fell down and broke their legs
[56:18] right they were just unprepared
[56:21] and they they say uh well this person
[56:24] went out hiking
[56:26] and they they didn't take no water you
[56:28] know right no water they were just out
[56:31] there in the wilderness
[56:34] they didn't know of the precautions or
[56:37] the dangers precautions
[56:40] what happened to this person
[56:42] he went out into the wilderness
[57:14] they
[57:17] weren't out there trying to be safe
[57:50] and I thought I asked him where did they
[57:53] shoot this elk at yeah
[57:59] okay I'm gonna wear my tennis
[58:01] and so when we got there it wasn't by
[58:05] the road
[58:06] it was up in the hills
[58:11] it was a place where you shouldn't be in
[58:14] shoe tanning shoes
[58:18] I was unprepared
[58:20] right and when I got in that situation
[58:23] I I said oh nothing will ever happen to
[58:25] me
[58:27] I got the reflexes of a cat oh yeah
[58:33] all right see I got the speed of a
[58:35] mongoose
[58:37] right I've been hiking these Hills for
[58:40] my whole life
[58:42] and and there are one there I was
[58:46] Sister Andrea Andrea call your dad Yeah
[58:51] I broke my leg
[58:54] so there I was was a busted leg
[58:59] because I was unprepared
[59:01] but we we get all Brave and we say oh I
[59:04] would never do that
[59:07] I would never go out prepared
[59:11] and then we get real religious
[59:15] I would never do what that brother does
[59:20] I'll never do what that sister does
[59:23] oh you're never going to catch me doing
[59:25] what that person
[59:28] all right
[59:30] yet every day in the spiritual guys
[1:00:24] God gives us a guide
[1:00:26] and we're living in a day
[1:00:29] that if not prepared or out of pocket in
[1:00:33] that if not prepared because you know or
[1:00:36] you're out of pocket I don't know if
[1:00:37] that's a word foreign
[1:01:38] he got lost
[1:01:41] amen amen he went chasing after a deer
[1:01:44] and he got lost
[1:01:47] now how many has ever been lost
[1:01:51] all right you've been lost
[1:01:54] now it's a feeling that you can't make
[1:01:57] up is
[1:02:01] you can't make it up
[1:02:04] you can't almost be lost
[1:02:38] I would purposely try to get myself
[1:02:42] but you you you can't fake it is
[1:02:51] being here you can't make it up
[1:02:54] let me see if if I can be lost
[1:02:58] no you can't make it up
[1:03:01] you have to be lost
[1:03:04] you're not really lost
[1:03:07] if you if you know your way back
[1:03:10] right if if you're lost
[1:04:02] right you you get scared if you could
[1:04:06] see the picture of a man
[1:04:09] who was lost if you could take his
[1:04:12] picture
[1:04:14] the expression on his face
[1:04:17] would be something you've never seen
[1:04:19] before
[1:04:21] there would be something that an artist
[1:04:23] couldn't draw
[1:04:25] you would be lost
[1:04:27] you would be lost and undone
[1:04:31] and one day each and every one of us
[1:04:35] and maybe here tonight
[1:04:38] you might find yourself
[1:04:43] don't know your way back
[1:04:46] let me tell you the prophet of God
[1:04:50] he said I knew
[1:04:53] there was a power line
[1:04:55] electricity
[1:05:01] from the cabinet
[1:05:04] I began to walk with my hands up
[1:05:08] that's the first step that you have to
[1:05:11] do is
[1:05:23] I was walking for miles
[1:05:26] my hands will get tired and cold
[1:05:30] but I knew if I would put my hands down
[1:05:35] I would miss that line
[1:05:38] tonight we need to do a reconfiguration
[1:05:42] of Our Lives
[1:05:48] until we reach that powerless
[1:05:52] no you would be scared and if you don't
[1:05:56] get back on track
[1:05:59] the consequences could be harsh last
[1:06:02] consequences brother Brown tells the
[1:06:05] story that he says
[1:06:07] if I don't make it back this is
[1:06:12] in that cabinet
[1:07:14] in our lives to get back on track in
[1:07:17] which
[1:07:22] God has placed in the church yeah
[1:07:28] those are the helpers
[1:07:30] that's the compass is
[1:07:33] placed in the church
[1:07:36] and you tell people
[1:07:38] you need a five-fold Ministry
[1:07:44] I know
[1:07:45] you'll see
[1:07:47] it's like the brother one time
[1:07:52] and we don't mention names
[1:07:54] but uh he he went hunting one time
[1:07:58] and uh he had bought a compass yeah
[1:08:05] these supplies and accessories
[1:08:09] we're getting ready to leave to go
[1:08:11] hunting when we're getting ready
[1:08:13] he says hey should I bring the compass
[1:08:17] did I bring my water yeah no no no you
[1:08:22] you brought it all this way to leave it
[1:08:23] here
[1:08:28] that's what you brought it foreign
[1:08:36] you have to use it for what it's
[1:08:39] intended foreign
[1:08:58] my wife is supposed
[1:09:00] she buys these rugs
[1:09:02] buys rugs okay
[1:09:05] I need a rug for the door
[1:09:08] for the kitchen
[1:09:14] well the intention of a rug
[1:09:17] right so that you walk in a home

[1:09:28] oh you don't take the contents of what's
[1:09:31] on your feet
[1:09:33] who the next room
[1:09:37] so its intention is
[1:09:41] stepped on wipe down
[1:09:44] right but every time I'm looking for a
[1:09:47] rug
[1:09:48] it's hanging on a chair it's
[1:09:52] hanging on the tub
[1:09:54] it's hanging over here well I say what
[1:09:58] where are all the wrongs
[1:10:00] I'm wiping that one off oh
[1:10:07] that's what they're intended
[1:10:11] foreign
[1:11:25] am
[1:11:26] en
[1:11:27] and swallowed they put inside of us now
[1:11:42] why now order people today
[1:11:46] they say listen you tell them you need a
[1:11:49] you need a counselor
[1:11:53] Jesus said in Mark in Marcos he said
[1:11:59] what did he say are you home
[1:12:05] he says it is expedient
[1:12:08] it's experience it's necessary it's
[1:12:10] necessary it's necessary it's a must
[1:12:14] it's a must that I go away they want to
[1:12:17] get back and this is
[1:12:28] that Greek word means is
[1:12:36] right and we say oh the comforter is
[1:12:39] going to come
[1:12:40] and he's gonna come for me
[1:12:45] he's gonna come for me this and that now
[1:12:48] okay yes he'll do that but he's also
[1:12:51] going to come
[1:12:53] we walk alongside
[1:12:55] to reprove the world
[1:12:59] he's gonna guide you
[1:13:05] to stay with your come back
[1:13:19] is he right beside you
[1:13:23] that's where we find the problem
[1:13:26] today
[1:13:28] but it's experience is necessary
[1:13:32] and he's going to come
[1:13:34] now everybody says listen they all say
[1:13:38] oh I I believe
[1:13:39] right you ask everybody do you believe
[1:13:43] how many believe
[1:13:45] everybody says oh I believe I believe
[1:13:48] you're clear right
[1:13:50] everybody believes nowadays
[1:13:53] now you can only believe
[1:13:56] in something you don't know right
[1:14:02] it's only oh I believe it I might not
[1:14:06] understand it
[1:14:07] no you know I don't understand at all
[1:14:10] but I believe it I might not know at all
[1:14:14] but I believe it so you believe on what
[1:14:18] you don't know
[1:14:20] right but Jesus said
[1:14:43] now that's a pretty big
[1:14:59] you believe by faith
[1:15:03] now there's there's a difference in
[1:15:05] believing
[1:15:07] and Believing by faith
[1:15:10] but you have to believe no
[1:15:14] um
[1:15:17] to be it's that easy now
[1:15:20] sometimes we say oh I I believe right we
[1:15:26] we're sick
[1:15:27] we go to the doctor
[1:15:30] and uh we we ask for prayer
[1:15:35] and we say um do you believe
[1:15:38] so out of fear
[1:15:41] well we we say oh I believe
[1:15:45] or or I look at my neighbor and we say
[1:15:48] uh I believe
[1:15:51] because our neighbor said we believe
[1:15:53] right
[1:15:55] now prophet of God says
[1:15:58] foreign
[1:16:00] in Reading in the message I know
[1:16:03] you'll say
[1:16:05] he says uh
[1:16:09] now
[1:16:11] he says why should a Christian ever be
[1:16:14] perplexed
[1:16:18] why wouldn't not everything run just run
[1:16:22] perfect as a for a Christian
[1:16:24] perfect
[1:16:28] that's that's why when if you're going
[1:16:31] to be a Christian Cristiano right you
[1:16:33] you can't be a
[1:16:35] call it a Sith
[1:16:39] right
[1:16:42] sister
[1:16:44] a little sister
[1:16:48] no no people say oh I'm going to be a
[1:16:51] Christian
[1:16:52] and now my walk is going to be just old
[1:16:55] peaches and creams
[1:17:00] but it doesn't and we know it and
[1:17:04] sometimes we have more troubles when we
[1:17:06] become a Christian
[1:17:09] we did when we were Sinners
[1:17:12] it is
[1:17:14] many are the afflictions of the
[1:17:16] righteousness
[1:17:24] God promised many afflictions
[1:17:29] strange feelings
[1:17:32] and strange things that would be beyond
[1:17:35] our understanding
[1:17:38] what it's always done for our Goods
[1:17:45] are you sick tonight
[1:17:48] all right
[1:17:50] it's done for our good Ness
[1:17:53] help us to understand that
[1:17:56] I remember when my when my son
[1:17:59] he would have an episode or a seizure
[1:18:04] and then all my I know get those I know
[1:18:09] you'll say oh I know you're saying I
[1:18:12] know you said they would become I don't
[1:18:14] know why
[1:18:15] you know oh God why why why
[1:18:20] don't you do this
[1:18:22] why why why
[1:18:24] are I know
[1:18:27] because I don't know
[1:18:29] and it would really affect me
[1:18:32] I would feel like why doesn't God do
[1:18:36] this
[1:18:41] now without those trials
[1:18:44] without those now
[1:19:22] [Music]
[1:19:40] in our last scripture reading
[1:19:45] I wanted to read some other scriptures I
[1:19:49] don't notice what time it was
[1:19:51] but I think it's about that time
[1:19:56] and so let's turn over in our our
[1:19:58] scripture
[1:20:00] to uh
[1:20:02] first Peter Pedro
[1:20:08] First Peter chapter one
[1:20:24] it says here
[1:20:26] Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the
[1:20:28] stranger scattered throughout pontus
[1:20:30] galathea Cappadocia Asia and
[1:20:35] Bith United
[1:20:44] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[1:20:46] God the Father through sanctification of
[1:20:49] the spirit upon obedience and sprinkling
[1:20:52] of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto
[1:20:54] you and peace be multiplied
[1:21:06] so what Peter's saying here
[1:21:09] is you are not forgotten
[1:21:12] for you have been chosen and destined by
[1:21:15] father God
[1:21:17] the Holy Spirit has set you apart to be
[1:21:20] God's holy ones
[1:21:24] obedient followers or followers of Jesus
[1:21:27] Christ
[1:21:28] who have been gloriously sprinkled with
[1:21:30] his blood yes
[1:21:33] may God's grace and peace Cascade over
[1:21:36] you
[1:21:38] many times over muchas business in verse
[1:21:41] 3 blessed be the God and father of our
[1:21:43] Lord Jesus Christ which according to His
[1:21:45] abundant Mercy hath begotten us
[1:21:58] begotten us again unto a lively Hope by
[1:22:01] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:22:02] the dead
[1:22:04] now that's shaunting material
[1:22:09] where are my Believers at
[1:22:12] that's shouty materials
[1:22:16] so maybe that didn't make you shout
[1:22:20] maybe this one will
[1:22:22] maybe this one will see
[1:22:26] yeah
[1:22:27] it says he we would just read verse
[1:22:30] three
[1:22:31] so Peter's saying celebrate with praises
[1:22:34] to God our Father
[1:22:37] yeah just follow me at this doesn't say
[1:22:39] just celebrate with praise
[1:22:42] the god of the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:22:45] Christ
[1:22:47] who has shown us his extravagant Mercy
[1:22:50] again
[1:22:52] for his foundation of Mercy
[1:22:56] has given us a new life
[1:22:59] we are reborn
[1:23:02] to the experience of a living
[1:23:06] energetic
[1:23:09] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:23:13] so this is the only place
[1:23:16] in the New Testament where the Greek
[1:23:19] verb
[1:23:24] and this shows that God himself
[1:23:28] is the one who gives us New Birth
[1:23:32] you must be born again
[1:23:35] but you're not
[1:23:56] because many times we say oh I I know
[1:24:03] you take a man like job
[1:24:06] there was not another man like job
[1:24:09] maybe you know but I don't know better
[1:24:13] General saying of a man that went
[1:24:16] through what job went through okay
[1:24:18] we've heard stories
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:24] those people lose something here and
[1:24:26] there yeah but job lost everything that
[1:24:30] he had said
[1:24:32] he lost it all and now now you say oh I

[1:24:42] I had five dollars
[1:24:45] job had it at all
[1:25:46] foreign work

[1:27:24] I know
[1:27:57] this one's good
[1:28:01] I promise you this one's really good
[1:28:07] right and it's found over in in Romans
[1:28:09] in Romanos uh chapter eight
[1:28:23] Romans chapter eight
[1:28:25] there's uh there is therefore
[1:28:28] no condemnation

[1:28:35] maybe your life has been in shambles and
[1:28:38] ruins but

[1:28:47] to them which are in Christ Jesus Christ
[1:28:50] Jesus who walk not after the flesh
[1:28:54] but after the spirit
[1:28:57] let me bring it to you in terms that
[1:28:59] might make you ciao
[1:29:04] so now
[1:29:08] this is a passion version
[1:29:12] so now Oda the case is closed
[1:29:18] there is therefore no condemnation
[1:29:23] so now the case a castle it's closed
[1:29:29] there remains no accusing voice of
[1:29:32] condemned me
[1:29:38] in life unions
[1:29:41] well Jesus the anointed one Jesus Jesus

[1:43:02] there will be no Sunday school this
[1:43:04] Sunday you know
[1:43:09] Domingo they'll take off this week

[1:43:19] children right away to the uh to the
[1:43:21] fellowship hall from Sunday
[1:43:23] schools
[1:43:27] so what we'll do is um you can just come
[1:43:30] in bring your children with you
[1:43:34] and then uh when uh they announced to
[1:43:38] bring the minister up to the front will
[1:43:40] dismiss the children to their classes

[1:43:51] we'll just bring the children back
[1:43:55] can you help us with that amen
[1:43:57] just uh for the reason that sometimes
[1:44:00] the services go a little longer
[1:44:04] it sometimes gets a little tiring
[1:44:10] just remember I said it gets tiring for
[1:44:13] the children
[1:44:14] no
[1:44:20] [Music]
[1:44:25] no but uh yeah um it'll help them
[1:44:28] and help our teachers as well
[1:44:51] amen God bless you
[1:44:54] we just want to go over a couple of
[1:44:56] church order items
[1:45:03] just a refresher on things that we've
[1:45:06] kind of gotten relaxed on
[1:45:12] number one is uh please watch the
[1:45:15] speeding in the parking lot
[1:45:21] we've had issues where you know if
[1:45:23] you're late
[1:45:24] what happens when we're late we speed
[1:45:27] right now
[1:45:34] nobody speeds
[1:45:37] we see people speed from turn into here
[1:45:42] you can hit 25 miles an hour
[1:45:48] keep watch
[1:45:50] for our children in the parking lot
[1:45:56] they sometimes take off from the doors
[1:45:58] and they run across and
[1:46:00] we don't need an accident
[1:46:06] please be vigilant to our children when
[1:46:09] entering or leaving the parking lot
[1:46:15] and big children too
[1:46:19] we're all children of God right
[1:46:24] uh number three is when deacons and
[1:46:27] ushers are finished locking up the
[1:46:29] churches
[1:46:35] feel free to Fellowship thank God
[1:46:39] we'll give you some time to Fellowship
[1:46:42] out there
[1:46:44] but then once the lights go out and
[1:46:47] we're ready to leave
[1:46:51] you're welcome to continue
[1:46:53] fellowshipping
[1:46:56] companies but just lock the gate for us
[1:47:03] and usually when we ask individuals to
[1:47:06] lock the gate they say no no no no we're
[1:47:09] going to our cars
[1:47:15] but we've we have had a couple issues
[1:47:18] where
[1:47:19] some individuals kind of got upset with
[1:47:22] the ushers and deacons and we don't need
[1:47:24] to have that either
[1:47:29] is open I think 24 hours
[1:47:34] IHOP is open 24 hours
[1:47:39] please please no gum chewing inside the
[1:47:42] church
[1:47:45] we've gotten relaxed us as ushers and
[1:47:48] deacons
[1:47:51] but we will tell you to spit it out okay
[1:47:59] um

[1:48:06] foreign
[1:48:13] now there are some nursing mothers who
[1:48:15] have younger children that do walk
[1:48:20] that's understandable there's not a
[1:48:23] problem with that
[1:48:25] but we do have some some mothers that
[1:48:28] are expecting and it's it gets really
[1:48:30] crowded back here
[1:48:36] so we would just ask that children that
[1:48:39] do walk if the parents mothers can take
[1:48:42] them to the upstairs cry room
[1:48:51] uh let's see
[1:48:55] uh we asked uh to please keep your
[1:48:58] children seated during
[1:49:00] the service
[1:49:05] and uh parents please don't get offended
[1:49:09] if you're approached
[1:49:11] but it is
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:15] and asked uh to take your child to one
[1:49:18] of the cry rooms

[1:49:26] disrupt the service with with the
[1:49:29] ministers up here while the services is
