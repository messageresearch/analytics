[16:27] [Music]
[16:29] God for
[16:31] [Music]
[16:36] sa how's everyone doing tonight good
[16:40] that's good uh we had a great service
[16:43] this morning didn't we like to thank
[16:45] brother Tommy for that and today I'm
[16:48] going to talk to the children about
[16:50] something everyone's mothers probably
[16:52] have on the ring can you guys guess what
[16:54] that would
[16:55] be he's quick
[16:59] exactly diamonds and we've heard the
[17:02] story of the wheat before how it's
[17:04] crafted and what it goes through but
[17:06] today I like to talk about the
[17:15] diamond so diamonds are made from one
[17:20] thing it's pure carbon and carbon is the
[17:24] most abundant the fourth most abundant
[17:26] element in the world so why aren't
[17:29] diamonds everywhere if they're abundant
[17:32] you guys have any
[17:34] idea cuz not all carbon goes through
[17:37] What It Takes and can take all the
[17:40] struggles of being a
[17:42] diamond and us as children of God are
[17:46] like
[17:46] carbon and so is the world but we are a
[17:50] special kind of
[17:52] carbon and we get to be shaped into
[17:55] diamonds and carbon what it takes to
[17:58] make carbon is has to be at least
[18:02] 2732 de
[18:05] F now I'll go open oven when my mom's
[18:07] making a cake and it's to like 350 and
[18:10] I'll feel like I burnt my face
[18:13] off but 2700 de I don't know if I could
[18:17] even take
[18:19] that and then it takes oh my good so
[18:22] much pressure to make a diamond it takes
[18:25] 78,000 lb 7 8,000 lb that's that's a lot
[18:32] I'll Jam my toe in like a table and I'll
[18:34] cry myself to sleep it's like equivalent
[18:37] to 400 men stepping on your pinky toe I
[18:41] don't even think you'd have a pinky toe
[18:42] after
[18:44] that and then besides the extreme
[18:47] circumstances to shape it it takes 1
[18:50] billion to 3.3 billion years to
[18:56] make so
[19:01] oh
[19:03] sorry I'm a little
[19:06] nervous okay thank you
[19:08] [Applause]
[19:10] Ronnie so it's not an easy process and
[19:14] it's not a quick one either neither is
[19:15] it to be a child of
[19:18] God and the word Diamond comes from the
[19:21] Greek word adamus which means proper
[19:25] unalterable and Unbreakable
[19:28] which I believe are also characteristics
[19:30] that can be used to descri describe any
[19:33] true
[19:35] Christian so what makes a diamond a
[19:38] diamond well first you got carrots
[19:42] people like oh I got a one carrot and
[19:44] stuff like that and then you got cut
[19:46] there are so many types of cuts and
[19:48] hardly any are ever the same they're all
[19:50] unique in their own special
[19:52] ways and then there's color which is
[19:54] usually judged by how close it is to
[19:57] White and then you have Clarity usually
[20:00] when they judge Clarity they go by if
[20:03] there's any blemishes in it most
[20:05] diamonds are blemish
[20:07] free and if you got a perfect diamond it
[20:10] is called a paragon how many here
[20:12] believe that they are
[20:16] Paragons diamonds are the hardest known
[20:19] natural material in the world they're
[20:22] not made just to look pretty they also
[20:25] can take pretty much anything you can
[20:27] throw at them
[20:31] and diamonds the interesting thing is
[20:32] because diamonds are made from carbon
[20:35] and carbon is known for being it likes
[20:38] to bond with other elements and it can
[20:40] make up to 10 million
[20:42] compounds so as just carbon it reacts
[20:46] with almost pretty much anything but
[20:48] once carbon is turned into a diamond it
[20:51] won't react with any other chemicals in
[20:53] the
[20:56] world so now I'm going to talk about how
[20:58] diamonds are
[21:00] shaped diamonds at first they they look
[21:03] like a normal Rock if I was to throw a
[21:05] diamond say outside you'd probably
[21:06] wouldn't even pick it up because you
[21:07] wouldn't think anything of it cuz it's
[21:09] raw and it hasn't been shaped yet so
[21:12] it's almost
[21:14] worthless that brings me to read a
[21:16] scripture from or a quote from brother
[21:19] brandham if the guys put it up for
[21:25] me says Kimberly South Africa once I was
[21:28] looking at diamonds how they brought up
[21:30] out of the ground and I seen them laying
[21:32] there as while the superintendent of the
[21:34] plant or the mine was one of my ushers
[21:37] in the prayer line and I noticed the
[21:39] diamonds valued at tens of thousands of
[21:41] dollars piled together but they didn't
[21:43] Sparkle even under the light and I said
[21:45] to the superintendent of the mines I
[21:48] said why don't they sparkle he
[21:56] said sir they haven't been cut
[21:59] yet you see diamonds can't reflect light
[22:03] until they're cut because they can't
[22:04] absorb that light until they've been cut
[22:07] and each and every Christian before they
[22:09] can reflect God has to be cut and
[22:14] shaped you see there are three different
[22:16] methods to cutting the Diamonds the
[22:19] first one which is the oldest recorded
[22:22] is cleaving it's nothing difficult it's
[22:25] actually pretty simple it's chiseled at
[22:27] the point of of
[22:29] weakness you just get a chisel and it
[22:32] doesn't make sense because diamonds are
[22:33] the strongest naturally thing in the
[22:36] world but you see the gem cutter which
[22:39] would be God in our case he finds that
[22:42] point of weakness and with a simple
[22:45] tap cuts it off and then he begins to
[22:48] shape us more
[22:51] delicately and then you have a skade
[22:54] which is a polishing wheel which this is
[22:57] pretty nice I think
[22:58] it's with oil and the only thing that
[23:01] they use to finally cut another diamond
[23:04] is Diamond itself just like how steel
[23:07] sharpens
[23:08] steel and then for even more precise
[23:11] shaping we have a diamond saw which is
[23:13] also oil and diamond
[23:15] dust and you see the gem cutter they
[23:18] have to be very careful with what
[23:19] they're doing because as they're cutting
[23:21] and cutting you can't just keep going
[23:24] because you see the saw makes friction
[23:27] with the diamond if you get friction you
[23:29] get heat you see if you put a diamond
[23:32] through too much heat it'll explode
[23:35] actually with that I'd like to read
[23:37] First Corinthians 10:13 if you like to
[23:41] turn to
[23:45] it and it reads there hath no temptation
[23:48] taken you but such as is common to man
[23:51] but God is faithful who will not suffer
[23:53] you to be tempted above that ye are evil
[23:56] but will with the Temptation also make a
[23:58] way to escape that you may be able to
[24:00] Bear it so as they're cutting this
[24:03] diamond they don't just hammer it and
[24:04] Hammer it cuz they know that diamond
[24:06] won't be able to take it all just as God
[24:08] knows that he'll only give us what we
[24:10] can bear because if you just keep
[24:12] hammering and hammering it sooner or
[24:14] later you're not going to have a diamond
[24:16] anymore it'll just be
[24:26] dust so how many here believe that they
[24:29] are
[24:30] diamonds any of you some of you kids
[24:32] might still be carbon and that's all
[24:34] right
[24:35] because all Christians start as
[24:37] something don't
[24:39] we you see that's the thing about God's
[24:42] grace is he takes us from being nothing
[24:44] to being something beautiful and
[24:47] Priceless and we as Christians we're
[24:49] much more than a
[24:51] diamond the Bible says 20,000 worlds and
[24:54] I don't know about you
[24:56] but that's just amazing how we can be I
[25:00] don't sometimes we don't feel worthy or
[25:02] like we can be valued as such a thing
[25:04] but we don't value ourselves is that God
[25:08] who values
[25:17] us I'm sorry I'm very nerv
[25:41] so as I was talking about how many of
[25:44] you kids ever feel like you're under a
[25:45] lot of pressure a lot of troubles in
[25:47] life you guys ever feel like that I know
[25:49] you're just kids but it's pretty tough
[25:52] life isn't
[25:55] it kids got problems too
[26:02] and maybe if you don't got problems
[26:03] right now I'm going to tell you right
[26:05] now if you're going to be a Christian
[26:07] it's not an easy walk you're always
[26:09] going to have pressure if you think that
[26:11] 78,000 lbs is a lot for a diamond you're
[26:13] in for a whole lot
[26:16] more but you see it's the rough things
[26:19] that make Christians so unique and
[26:22] special
[26:24] and do you guys think any
[26:28] like let's say if carbon could talk
[26:32] which it don't but if it could do you
[26:34] think any carbon like all carbon might
[26:36] look at a diamond and be like oh yeah I
[26:37] want to be a diamond why not it's
[26:39] beautiful perfect but if carbon was to
[26:43] know what it would go through do you
[26:44] guys think it'd ever want to be a
[26:47] diamond see the thing is carbon doesn't
[26:51] choose to be a diamond it's chosen to be
[26:56] [Applause]
[27:00] and the thing about diamonds is what
[27:03] makes them so special is how it's hard
[27:04] to find them it's not like they just pop
[27:06] up out of the ground if they did it be
[27:08] no different from dirt it wouldn't even
[27:10] be special anymore diamond is hidden
[27:14] thousands of miles under the Earth's
[27:16] crust so it doesn't just come out it's
[27:19] not easy to find you have to work for it
[27:21] you see the diamond never looks for the
[27:24] minor it's always the minor that has to
[27:27] find the diamond
[27:29] and just like that that's also God
[27:32] looking for us we we've never sought God
[27:36] but see it's cuz that Miner knows that
[27:38] that diamond is worth so much
[27:46] more takes 1 billion to 3.3 billion
[27:51] years and it's crazy because that's
[27:53] probably just as old as the Earth is
[28:02] see as Christians it's not an easy walk
[28:04] you know we all go through our struggles
[28:06] and I know you guys are just kids right
[28:08] now but I just want to let you guys know
[28:11] that it's not going to be easy and it's
[28:15] never easy to be a Christian and it's
[28:17] going to be tough for you all but you
[28:19] all will eventually and I know each and
[28:23] every one of you if you stay in God's
[28:24] perfect will you all will become so much
[28:27] more than what you you are now and you
[28:29] will be valued in the eyes of God thank
[28:41] you wow for someone to think of us as
[28:46] diamonds praise the Lord praise the Lord
[28:50] amen that's my little brother as I like
[28:52] to refer him
[28:54] as amen if we're going to sing a song
[28:57] but if any of the young children has a a
[29:00] special or testimony we're going to have
[29:02] a little testimony service right now so
[29:05] you just keep that in mind if when we
[29:07] finish the song if you have one just
[29:08] come on up amen would you please stand
[29:11] and we'll sing a
[29:13] song His Banner Over Me Is
[29:17] Love I feel l so much
[29:20] today the Lord is mine and I am his his
