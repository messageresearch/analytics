[28:41] answer yourself this this morning Moses
[28:44] said we're all gonna stand before the
[28:47] judgment seat but when are you going to
[28:51] stand before the judgment seat of Christ
[28:53] and if one does that I've stayed they'll
[28:55] antes it you will not die before the
[28:56] rapture
[28:57] antes del Greco or after the Millenium

[29:23] but it is to help one another but I do
[29:26] that alone and the only way we can ever
[29:27] be of help to one to another como como

[29:54] king contract and we realize that not
[29:56] everyone sees the same thing when they
[29:58] read in the most ghetto condo that's
[30:02] what's so incredible about the message
