put a subtitled the explosion of the seventh seal um we went yesterday from or last Sunday from The Silence of the seven seal the Domingo pasado El silencio now we're going to the explosion of the seven seal yeah you know the seven seal is so many things if you want to just put it down to one little thing you're looking you're not gonna miss it that's why there's three parts to it right you know what part we're in amen but the explosion we want to we know it happened first here okay silence in heaven silencio but there's activity on Earth the activity is the sons of God coming forth it is the Masterpiece being finished and so we as we get into this you don't see something or don't agree with something just put it to the side but we want to go according to the leading of the holy spirit this morning what is God's Great economy guess is extra that's that's that that's what it's all about and so if we can go into the scriptures God bless all of you that I know some of you didn't have electricity this morning amen but uh but you're here God bless you for your efforts there's lots of people that are out on vacation taking some time to to get some rest may God help them bless them wherever they are is Revelations 8 1 apocalypse is Ocho Uno we won't have have service this afternoon but uh but let's uh let's just let's just enjoy ourselves this morning nobody's in a hurry this morning right God bless those that are that are on uh on hookup this morning God bless you wherever you may be amen Revelations 8 1 and there and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour I want to go then to Revelation 17. verse 6 and 7 verses is and you have it you can say Amen it's going to seem at first like a like uh this part doesn't go with it but you'll see how it comes together in it and and and uh it's all part it's all in the great plan of God Revelation 17 let's start with verse 5. and upon her forehead was was a name written mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth is and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of saints of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus when I saw her I wandered with great admiration Jesus what words we find here John seeing this mystery Babylon Juan bien Babylonia he wondered with great admiration was admiring it is and verse 7 says and the angel said unto me watch the angel catching John's reaction to this wherefore did thou Marvel I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman and of the Beast that carrieth her which half the seven heads and the ten hornsas but we are glad that we have the God sent a prophet the only way we would understand the mystery of the woman amen may God add His blessings to the Ring of his word you may be seated I could actually have named this also Beauty and the Beast but let's go into this if we can try the nest during this during this this trip that me and my wife went on a couple of places that the Lord allowed us to visit was uh Rome and Pompeii where Roma Pompeo and most of you of course all of you know Roman Pompeii are are ruined three ruins left when brother Branham speaks about the about Los Angeles and so forth Los Angeles he says it'll be worse than the last days of Pompeii this is and things that I've always wanted to I guess if you can say on your bucket list I always wanted to go to Rome thankful to the Lord that he permitted us to go to Jerusalem last year now I wanted to go to Rome and when you go into Rome and Pompeii is what a what a filthy low down immoral places that they were you know you you hear about things and you and you you see pictures and you hear stories and escucha kosas all it was in these places it was nothing but pleasure self-gratification entertainment until it got to a place that God said that's enough he brought judgment on them and and and Pompeii Pompeo all it was was just a city of brothels yeah that's right there's nothing but houses you walk the streets and everywhere oh they say oh this was another one now oh this was another one that's all it was was just cities of pleasure but there was a certain day that came when they least expected it when Mount Vesuvius that volcano erupted El Monte Vesuvius is and it destroyed that City many of you maybe have seen the movie or or have read about it we saw a a woman that was that had that the lava had gotten to her when they when they when they dug and they found this woman she she was like this with her with her arm over her face trying to cover her eyes but she could not outrun the judgments of God they never thought that the wrath of God God's judgments would ever get to them we live in a world today that is exactly like that we think we can live any kind of life and and that the judgments of God are not going to get to us I want to say today that is the LIE of the devil is it will catch up to you one day if you cannot accept his grace and mercy that he's offering today these places had created such an economy that they came to a place that they thought they didn't need God anymore they could do it on their own and there that great city has now become nothing but you'd have to dig 30 feet under the Earth to find the ruins of it and now one of the weakest most degraded nations in the world he said they're not even self-supporting my student Athens Greece in Athens another Empire once stood Imperial and there's not hardly a symbol of that Empire left I stood in Cairo Egypt which was which once ruled the world in the days of the Pharaohs and there's nothing left but a sphinx and a few pyramids and brother and sister he says hate America the Grand America and our great economy that we have yet is rot rotting under the foundations and someday I see it in the making right now we'll lay in Ruins and you young men today you said this whole you young women with the beauty of Youth the blush of the young cheek Rocio in ensues the Folly of the young heart but one day we'll wander in a graveyard somewhere because all Mortals have to give way to immortality he says every nation has to fall because they're there's coming a nation God is always warning and he always sends warning judgment he gives us an opportunity to repent and many times we turn our backs on him how many opportunities how many more opportunities do how many more opportunities will we will ask you that question because I believe that God is doing because in all reality the teeth trash that that gets accredited over the years and I believe that he's he's clearing the trash out how many believe that it's for us to check our lives and then we try to serve God and we just can't seem to get anywhere too much much accumulation of trash want to know maybe at times these messages might get a little hard obviously I'm not attacking one Persona I'm not against a person I'm against Spirits he's just he he's aiming it at you can't believe him if you want but I'm I'm after your well-being I'm after making it home now while we were in Rome I I we were able to visit the Vatican yes and while there this is the scripture that came to me of Revelation 17 the apocalypse is this is yes and John marveled when you walk through the vatic and I if there's anyone here that's ever been there you and and as we were as I was as I was as I was pondering this scripture I could hear the angels say why did you Marvel if uh police I'll tell you the mystery of the woman and the Beast walking down the hallways and I wish I would I should have had some pictures for you just to see him but walking around down those hallways all the paintings and the and the sculptures of marble Las pinturas tapestries the gold the Grandeur of it all I felt much like John Juan all you can do is Marvel wow and and the more we would look and we'd see those things you can see how Constantine he brought the heathens and the and the Christians together into this room there's all these Roman gods Joseph Romano you walk into another room there's all these gods of of different of different civilizations Gods everything you can think of is in that room all Under One Roof you look at that and you say wow thank God for a prophet you still meetings it's something when when the scripture says that the wealth of the world was found in here Gold Everywhere You Look even there's stash of gold that's just gold trimmings when I as I was seeing these things the Angels saying I will tell thee the mystery and even though we know that Babylon deals with the Catholic Church it is amazing to see how how far it reaches or it has infiltrated the whole world it doesn't matter if you're Catholic or not that Spirit of Rome has infiltrated the whole world infiltrated the churches everywhere you look you see Babylon Babylonia Babylon isn't just the church Babylonians it is religion it is denomination Babylon is Abominations I've never seen a people more confused in the world today is right now you never see more confused people don't know who they are where they belong in church they belongs if they're male or female go on and on and Everywhere You Look it's confusion Babylonia mystery Babylon Babylonian and the only one that could reveal this mystery was the seventh angel yeah message that was brought is made us aware of this mystery Babylon NOS is the confusion in the churches yes Zechariah if you can open your scriptures to Zechariah Chapter 4 and verse 6 and 7. in zakarias you might not think it goes together but I'm telling you it's perfect he says being sick you know uh awake this this morning Amen Brother Jimmy's awake anybody else awake all right all right now let's let's follow this this for a moment then he answered and spoken to me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubbabel say not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who are Downton before the Rel shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the head thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace to it this all goes with Babylon okay I asked my family the question last night so I want to ask you what was the commission to zerubbabel anybody can answer what was this Commission he's close but okay yeah that's right right to restore or rebuild the Temple everybody in agreement okay zoruba Bell then was to restore or build the temple a restaurant under the message of Grace the types right that's why we read that we read that quote that said it's all through all the types of the Bible show it was the prince with who with Joshua not right not the Joshua that was with Moses with Joshua the high priest at that time yes is the type of who is hold on brother Jim let somebody else you can answer all the questions okay the rubber belt then it's it's shown in types is okay well you're you're right there yes that's right you're close but but let's fine tune it a little bit more yeah because Joshua the high priest is the type of our high priest right Jesus Christ is our high priest but there's a prince that goes with that with Joshua the high priest let's go back because the rubber bout was commissioned to restore or rebuild the temples oh let's let's bring it closer to home now the rubber Bell is a type of the rubber Bell is a type of we're not getting nowhere okay somebody finally zerubbabel is a type of the seventh Angels he's a type of the seventh angel messenger because he's the one that has and brought them that was to restore the temple right and you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and it was to be under the message of Grace now now he was to rebuild the church again and we understand that Paul was the wise master builder the foundation he said and another bill is the pawn but they were it was to rebuild the church on English sometimes we sing songs in church and we don't even know what they mean but now you can sing it and know what it means yes okay now you can sing with Revelation and when you sing with Revelation honors and it comes down and He blesses his people the problem is is that we just sing sitting there with a base and I'm watching you this is [Music] and I'm like wow they're they're excited you can't even hear nothing why are you even clapping right you know who you are how guilty you are I'm trying to help you here because we don't come to church to worship to soothe our conscience that well we're here probably over half of the church don't even sing and I'm watching everything watching everybody else they don't even care if they sing they're not here to worship with this Holy Spirit and then some of you ain't nothing coming out when are they going to finish [Music] and that's the church yes no wonder he had to pull a bride out of the church he was to build this church and restore it under the power of the Holy Ghost come on church under the power and power means that there's something there's a force behind it again come to church with that Force oh but when we're watching a a basketball game or a football game or or whatever we like Mickey Mouse yeah we go anywhere and we are just oh yeah is OC in church what a shame yeah we're gonna clean house is what we're gonna do la casa is a rubber ballot type of the seventh Angelo and I began to think then how can can the rubble belt type the seventh Angelo the very names are rubber bellombres when you break down on the stairs the seed or born is born in Babylon in Babylonia born in confusion yeah the question is how can that type the seventh angel good question brother Branham says this my background is Irish Catholic is catholico Irish it was this so he was born into a family he was born in Babylon or confusion Babylonia he was not confused but he was born into confusion and his purpose was to take you and I confusion so how could he take us out of confusion if he went to confusion to pull us out okay now now we're making some some Headway now it had to fulfill scripture that the ministry of seventh Angels was to bring us out of Babylon or confusion Revelation Team Four and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues watch the activity of the seventh seal come become more clearer in the message why I am against organizations and this Angel's message was echoing his message on Earth he was echoing his message on Earth his message on Earth to come out of Babylon the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word I gotta say that one more time the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the world the mystery beginning to unfold and it's written through every type in the Bible Leviticus 18 23.3 and you have it you can say Amen I don't know why I'm so dry it's you dry you're okay you're hydrated huh in case you need one this is for you buddy verse 23 neither shalt thou lie with any Beast to defile thyself therewithamento Aman amancio but in English in English it says you say animal but in English it's beast in English they say neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down there too it is confusion is what's the type in the Old Testament showing you in the type so that you can understand the mystery later neither shall any woman or a woman is a church stand before a beast or a power to lie down with that it is confusion yes amen are you are you with me that scripture is pointing to the original sin is the woman lying with it is what interrupted God's rest in the beginning God is not the author of confusion or Babylon oh Babylonia confusion distracts let me tell you the mystery of the woman and the Beast brother Brian says she was the most beautiful woman that ever lived he was Beauty and she got caught up with the Beast he said it's not by coincidence why do you think people just make up these these yeah and then we feel so warm and fuzzy inside foreign yeah she did see but at the end time that man will become a beast again think about that when Saiyan is cast down in and in court himself in a man and it'll be the beastia it's just it's all there mystery Babylon the great Mysterio Babylon mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth Abomination is something contrary to the plan of God it's contrary to God's Great economies there's nothing left of the original city of Rome it ruins everywhere but here in LA that Rome is not just a city in Italy yeah in Italian Rome is a spirit that has infiltrated the whole world God help us this this morning in the message serpent seeds and that iron come from the legs which was wrong and there's a streak of romanism mixed in every through the Catholic church he says that's exactly right notice Rome exists this is the 70th week of Daniel notice Rome exists to the end oh my oh yeah because it went to the end of the toes and though there were ten toes those ten toes became the ten horns yes we'll go into that in another time but watch Iron the strength of Rome runs in all those Nations you can see how the world economy has continued to diminish and diminished till every country in the world will be busted or is busted already is because the wealth of the world was found in here have to watch this Spirit now it's so subtle that if you don't understand it or get it you won't even know it when it's got a hold of you hi I'm telling you it is so Sly this spirit is the spirit and the only way that we won't be deceived it's because there's a foundation stone that declares who's behind it all who it is that's deceiving the whole world the only ones that we will not be deceived are those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life foundation stone is fundamental the Bible exposes him him as a deceiver in other words the bupin is low is he wasn't exposed when the book was closed but the opening of that book exposes you get into the message read the message put the word inside of you uh without the word you're gonna be deceived one way or another I'm I'm trying to warn you important this is watch this meet it you're a creation of the word because that foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world was ever made I want you all to get that because if you got it you'd be shouting amen foundation stone is now I've gotta put it to myself foundation stone was laid in me you to tell yourself that Foundation storms before the foundation of the world predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God for Christ is the word you can see how these world economies continues and there is no foundation for these things this is our founding pastor is watch this Revelation unfold is [Music] he takes the blood of his brother or he takes the blood forgive me and his brother is not pleased because it pleased God what his brother did in other words what Abel did displeased Kane because Cain his brother that Abel was not trying to hide the sins of his mother and father yeah evil was not not trying to hide this thing is that problem everybody's trying to hide their sins I'm trying to hide their things that they do right you can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time but you cannot owe all the people and when Cain saw that able was not just sweeping it under the rug Able by Revelation knew that God required blood he he knew what had happened in the Garden of Eden there was blood that was spilled oh so what did he do he knew what God required he wasn't gonna hide it it doesn't please God because you come to church the Devil comes to church matter of fact he's the first one here you must come with the perfect sacrifice with a perfect office with the perfect mind of how to please not just coming to church if you just come to church just to come it's mystery Babylon is Mysterio de Babylonia I'm gonna say that again I will come to church just to come it's mystery Babylon is the Harlot the great mother of Harlot Madre de Ramirez we're either part of the mystery of Babylon Mysterio de baby or part of the mystery of God which one come on now you got to check yourself we're either part of one economy or the other parties what I said last Sunday one of the greatest distractions when we get into a position or office that doesn't pertain to us that's a dangerous place to be is they tried to handle the fire of God uh uh and they weren't called to do that are serious it runs through because it's showing us something how many of you believe that all that the prophets has spoke well all that the the messenger of the age brought to us Manos who doesn't that way I can have a meeting with you yeah why you don't know okay now now God's taking your word for it to give everything that the prophet spoke so let me let me preach or let me foreign I mean believe it so far so I'd rather you your pastor tell you about marriage and divorce issues and them things yes let him do it for he's God's servant too he's equipped yes so let me stop and ask the question how many of you are qualified to deal with marriage and divorce affairs it's not a trap it's the truth how many of you once again are equipped or qualified to give marriage counseling watch how Sly this is because when someone comes to us and has some issues the first thing we do is we listen to them you're out of the will of God already out of God's economies you have just become a trash can come on you said you believe God's word you said you believe God's word anyone who thinks that they're helping somebody with their marital problems you're out of your place you're in a dangerous place this is a warning to everyone because we say oh no I don't deal with those things you sit there and you listen to it of going against the word it's a warning I didn't call you to handle those things he put a pastor there says I refer them to the Past exactly what people should do is the first thing that you should tell somebody stop go talk to the pastor but uh amen amen why isn't that done oh we're cleaning we're cleaning houses oh we'll tell them that sometimes after we've sat there and heard what they had to say yes brings confusion because you're not called to deal with those things it's going to affect you sooner or later because you're not the ox of the church to carry those burdens and pull those things why do you want to do something you're not called to do it's funny how people think is Mysterio people who are in a in a specific Place what's the deception well I'm gonna go to somebody that has been through what I'm going through no one else would understand what a dumb statement you're going to go to somebody that's hidden through the same thing foreign that's why the person should automatically hold on I'm not a trash can because if you are really a friend a friend is not someone that lends their ear to you my friend is someone that will point you in the right direction correct a friend will say run to the words well they've never been to this but the help is in the word and Christ is the anointed of the hour that has been that been placed to help you in your situation he has a way out for you not everybody mad at the Devil this morning just deception and confusion after a while knows too many things about everybody so what happens we get cold in church but you know the difference between us and Satan can't experience what he believes write that one down Satan cannot experience what he believes but we as children of God in heaven about the space of half an hour is that there was silence in heaven not Earth because the activity was here on Earth now notice this now not this as we continue to go forth the Bible says that that knowledge shall increase I want to read something that brother Ron sent me this morning why is there so much deception too much knowledge we don't have the right tools to filter it unless you're a Son of God filters everything by the word okay watch this now yes the volume of knowledge watch watch what it says here the doubling rate of knowledge supportive during the the mid 20th century in Prelude knowledge would double every 25 years so you'd have to wait 25 years to get twice as smart as you guys are influencia speed which technology technology is progressing is the driver which is up ending our careers transforming lives disrupting economies and there's such a huge divide a digital divide that is being created in fact it is estimated is estimado that 90 percent of the world's data you know the information of the world's data information del Mundo was generated in the last two years alone you talk about knowledge increasing in the last two years in the space of 13 years this figure has increased by an estimated 60 times from just two zettabytes I don't even know what is that about it is that was generated in 2023 is expected to increase by over a hundred and fifty percent in 2025 once again knowledge was doubling every 25 years and as of 2013 knowledge was doubling every 13 months but today Roy knowledge is almost doubling every day imagine that doubling every day and you start to see you exponential one day two days I mean Grace we're sitting there the other day grace estamos centados let's see how much we know let's do some trivia trivia and she was popping out answers and I was like how did you know that is there's sponges and they take knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge but I tell you young people put on the mind of Christ you have too much knowledge coming in you don't know what to do with it you're crazy it makes you nervous too much too much you need a filter neces we're going good like I said we're just going to take our time today you're comfortable what's the key here now we talked about the reason there was silence in heaven Satan was still in heaven right during the time of the opening of The Seven Seals he's been cast down until Revelations 12 7-9 God had created but it was marred during his rest mark it was um it was marked during his rest thousand years he's been making another Masterpiece how many are part of that Masterpiece God's Great economy but a masterpiece that can't and will not fail and if we don't catch the type will never catch the Anta type watch as he as we continue here Genesis 1 31 and this is we got to put all these things to understand this this explosion explosion and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening in the morning were the sixth day yeah under six days or six seals is the plan or book of redemption but we go in Genesis chapter 2 in Ramos uh Genesis the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the hosts of them and on the seventh day is God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made God blessed the seventh day Sanctified because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made if then God had finished it what was left to do what was left for the man to do yeah so what a confidence I'm gonna rest in you what you say what you do and then look at do this and look it to us is okay you're not good you're okay with that watch this watch this now we didn't meet it it was time for his son and daughter to do their part what was their part let's go back Genesis 1 28. God bless them said unto them be fruitful and multiply you're gonna need that word in a minute and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over all those things we know yes the Masterpiece their job was to begin to produce sons and daughters ah there had to be an explosion of the seventh day that would bring forth were children with me come on you gotta follow the type there have to be an explosion that would bring forth children but before the serpent came in it interrupted it all now watch as this unfolds more now the only way that God's Great economy was to function correctly it wasn't gonna function correctly with just Adam and Eve that was just the start everyone who's never written in the Lamb's Book of Life when will it come to its Perfection completion uh no no that was just the plan solo fuel plan but it was all to come to its completion or end culmination under the seventh seal all right let's see how this unfolds the types and shadows the seven seal is the end of all things this is why there's so many pieces to the seven seal uh types the Shadows but but watch it now it's the completion of all things like consummation watch what's going on here completing is the complete revealing of the mystery of God he didn't preach Christ the mystery until after the seals I'm going to say it again he did not he did not preach Christ The Mystery of God revealed till after the seals because Christ is the mystery of God revealed and the only way to see the completion of the seven seal mystery uh we must follow the continuity of it in order to know what the end looks like the mystery of God Christ is the mystery of God reveals amen amen and he cries by himself is not the end of the mystery of God I'm Christ The Mystery of God of amen amen we're waiting for more all that God was he poured into Christ here we go but we put a period there no no no no what's the continuation of the mystery and all that Christ was he poured into the church the mystery continues you know a sequence of this that's the sequence of the revelation of the seven seal mystery sequences is Christ and his bride yes United at last perfect Masterpiece it has produced Sons and Daughters were children many think that the seven seal just one thing like I said there's so many things because it's the finality of all things now watch the explosion now this is important is important in the message the seventh seals that's where we get the explosion of the seven seal yeah it's just like firing a rocket into the air we've read this so many times and that rocket is to quit this this you gotta catch this that rocket explodes here explota why because the first from the seven Thunders did they utter in heaven or Earth they uttered on Earth so that rocket explodes here first revelation of this church it explodes here and it goes up then it explodes again brother Branham then uses the phrase is that right seven thunders in heaven I thought they they stay uttered on Earth explosion was here on Earth the expressions two explosions of the rocket before the stars came out but then it puts out five stars and one of those Stars explodes and blows out five stars and one of them Stars explodes and blows out five stars from it exploitation what's going on here let's go back to the type what did he say he says God told him be fruitful and multiply that's exponential right here Hallelujah what's the explosion of the seventh seal middle Exposition and it fades on out that's what the seventh seal is it's the explosion of it it's like it's exponential are you Understanding God's Great economy watch this now and every time it explodes of God come on the scene I gotta say that again every time there's an explosion Sons and Daughters come on the scene coming to be manifested here on Earth we are here to be manifested we are the manifested sons of God every time an explosion there's a multiplication fulfilling scriptures from that Prophet came forward boom this five full minutes where were you job don't understand hope when the sons of God morning Stars and the sons of God shouted for jobs what an explosion yeah explosion but we can all glorify God praise him glorification to be an explosion in church every time we come but the reason there's nothing is because some have not yet wise that they are sons of God when you become a Son of God and you know it there's an explosion now today nothing can keep you quiet even if the deacons say calm down exploitando that's why many are still looking for something they're looking for the bride's Revival to come is now that's a that's a good one and you got to walk very careful on this no no maybe you don't agree with me here but I'm just going to tell you what the messenger said because the first thing we'll do is we'll go to the third sale and we'll say let's read that the third still okay the bride hasn't had a Revival yet hold on to that no Revival for the bride there are parts that are coming I agree but don't put everything out there come on you gotta knows there has to be a Revival here in you Awakening and Reviving in us right now we won't be there but uh that [Music] you understand don't misunderstand me here it's revealingo revealing means that a little at a time right okay that's what we understand it's revealing all the time oh here it is watch this now I I love these things but we realize that it's not all in the future he's saying this is when he's saying we're looking for it now the bride's Revival wouldn't come nowhere and couldn't come until [Music] would come and be unfolded what's going to do it to her he's only on the third sill when he makes this statement Revival means to revive or make Alive come conscious again in other words to awaken you that's what the message of the hour does it makes us conscious again that we were with him from the beginning we came from God we're gonna go back to him he will not lose not one of us oh it makes you conscious again that's why many people don't understand the New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and we must be born spiritually first all right oh we're born naturally but uh but we got to be born spiritually the real New Birth is when you die when you're burnt out of this corruption you're referred into incorruption burned out of mortality into immortality our first birth we were birth corruptible our second birth we're birthed Incorruptible for this Mortal must put on immortality corruption must put on incorruption is a little bit more okay Tomas all right we won't finish today but we'll bro a Revival was to take place under the seventh and so it was after the opening of the seals then brother Branham preaches message watch Revival is Awakening he preaches in 1964. after the sales were open has not had her Revival yet 1964. recognizing your day in its message he says one of the finest papers on the field Herald of his coming but they hardly will print anything unless it's fast pray fast pray and not a trumpet says oh you know we see it all the time why do they do that why do they do that he asked it twice they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening Grace there will be an Awakening what have they done yeah they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride oh come on when you put everything in the future you're not leaving nothing now they have not recognized The Awakening or Revival of the prize by being a Christian Cristiano they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done have already been opened yes have not recognized what has been done that's what's making them feel that way something is supposed to happen see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you is in que tapa when did it happen when did this Awakening happen when the rocket exploded I'm gonna say it again when did this happen this Awakening the rocket exploded when it did Apostles came forward prophets and teachers and evangelism what did it produce It produced Garcia Israel what an explosion explosion I want to know how many of you came out of one of those explosions [Music] [Music] he's creating a masterpiece and now where are we at the Masterpiece has now come together waiting for only one thing esperando solo for The Headstone to come in propheta what an explosion explosion what an explosion the explosion we're going through that for a while just a few more minutes okay is that okay all right come on now you gotta know you came from an explosion explosion brother Branham says this is when we talk about this great explosion Instagram explosion he says in the seventh sill I was standing right there and this explosion is the explosion of this watch the seventh angel now I was looking this way towards the West is you have a a picture of the cloud if you do up back there please put it up I went Plum out of my knowing and one of them coming was the one that looked so strange to me it was the one uh be to the left where I entered the constellation but counting from left to right see coming across remember the seven messages but if that was the breaking of that seal yes yes that was the breaking of that seal yes yes what if that was the angel that sent forth there yes that blasted almost me off the ground they always stand in there three Witnesses standing close rest that I told you before I went there would be an explosion explosion that would almost send me up and I was caught up by the seven angels and come Eastward the thing like to shook me from the ground they're stuck because you need an explosion in your life sometimes we're so stuck you're stuck you need an explosion explosion don't even let me get into that because it deals with the completion the finality of everything and as one thing Fades away another thing comes forth why if we could understand what the passing of these great men has done you know I mean we're always looking back oh look at what this is I'll bring it to our pastor that star exploded already what needed to come out already came out but it has to fade away so that someone else you have to understand this car already exploded Fades away you and I could not come we are Sons and Daughters of God it opens up a real a realm we find that the sick still has been opened to us but just because it can't be broke to the public doesn't mean it's not broke to the bride significant he will not keep any secrets from his secretos I'm coming around the corner now watch that watch the third pool then it'll be absolutely to the total loss Perdido but it will be for the bride and the church to the total lost but uh for the bride and the church the book is already opened just waiting for the seventh seals to be identified where is it being identified right now it has to be identified of the coming of Christ is the coming of Christ is what brings him back to Earth I get excited I'm sorry this is the only thing we live for it his expressions are finally finished Souls that are in prison now he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest and a man that's got the spirit of God in him or a woman lives that word lives right out in them that's the heart is Silence silencio from that lives the word that heartbeat is the beat of the drum I gotta stop here for a moment and go you get flooded too much it's the beat of the drums thank you okay you're engaged bit of the drums like this wedding day comes nerves oh wait a minute wait a minute seven

Earth I'm finishing up the pergamian church age the first son was Adam spoken word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself and then the bride was to unite with him he's gonna Unite with with her husband produce another Son of God but watch he was supposed to reproduce himself one plus one equals that's why the bride was given to him produce himself by hybridization she caused him to die also a spoken seed word of God was given a bride as was that um she like Adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God or doubt the word and die he doubted she left the word she died but in these last days the true bride of Christ will come to The Headstone he will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be won they will be the very manifestation the word of the Living God the seven still opens with an explosion it's still
