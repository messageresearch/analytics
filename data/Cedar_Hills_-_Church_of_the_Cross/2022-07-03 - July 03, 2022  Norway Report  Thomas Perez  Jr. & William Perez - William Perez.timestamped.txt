[1:08:00] william god bless his word that we heard
[1:08:03] this morning
[1:08:06] it is
[1:08:08] wow what more can you say
[1:08:11] wow
[1:08:12] i i was telling our pastor that is the
[1:08:15] best message i have
[1:08:16] uh and and
[1:08:22] that i have
[1:08:32] and uh we don't want to take the word of
[1:08:34] god like
[1:08:36] just just like anything
[1:08:42] and there are people around the world
[1:08:47] that are depending upon what you do here
[1:08:55] and i don't think
[1:08:56] and i i
[1:08:58] put myself at the top
[1:09:02] river i put myself
[1:09:06] that i i don't don't don't think that we
[1:09:09] really realize
[1:09:11] what impact this little church has had
[1:09:13] around the world
[1:09:18] but all the way all the way i would who
[1:09:21] would have thought it
[1:09:24] all the way to norway
[1:09:27] you would think because we're so close
[1:09:29] to the borders
[1:09:34] of course
[1:09:35] mexico and latin america
[1:09:38] mexico and america
[1:09:40] but it's surreal but
[1:09:44] to to think about about
[1:09:46] uh
[1:09:53] and now that the the
[1:09:55] that the whole continent of europe has
[1:09:58] been open to us
[1:10:14] was there rescued off the coast of
[1:10:17] norway
[1:10:24] that a hundred over a hundred years
[1:10:26] later
[1:10:28] his descendants would go to establish a
[1:10:31] church in that same country
[1:10:38] to be able to
[1:10:40] to see what we have seen
[1:10:43] to be able to accomplish accompany our
[1:10:46] pastor
[1:10:47] pastor and sister lorena herrmann lorena
[1:10:50] for the william adamanna william and
[1:10:52] those that will subsequently go lost
[1:10:56] it has been something out of this world
[1:11:00] i passed we passed by uh
[1:11:02] uh uh just maybe uh a patch of flowers
[1:11:09] violet in color
[1:11:12] and i
[1:11:14] looked at those violet flowers
[1:11:17] flores tears came to my eyes
[1:11:24] if she could see us now
[1:11:28] and i know that the lord
[1:11:30] lets them see through the banister of
[1:11:32] time
[1:11:37] what a time we had
[1:11:40] and i'm going to say this again
[1:11:43] we don't really realize
[1:11:47] what we have
[1:11:49] what god has done through us
[1:12:06] in a travesty
[1:12:08] a man fully consecrated to him
[1:12:14] by god's grace he said
[1:12:16] i ain't going to be that man
[1:12:19] i aim to be that
[1:12:20] many and so
[1:12:23] the the simplicity of the gospel is
[1:12:26] simply
[1:12:27] the simplicity of the gospel
[1:12:32] is this yes is that we have come too far
[1:12:39] to ever go back
[1:12:42] to go back to what
[1:12:44] god has revealed himself like never
[1:12:46] before
[1:12:48] god
[1:13:01] and its power as you heard this morning
[1:13:06] you found out that god every scripture
[1:13:09] is god breathed
[1:13:31] vienna uh uh
[1:13:34] it comes to being it comes to production
[1:13:36] venezera
[1:13:38] a production production when you go out
[1:13:41] on the field
[1:13:43] the field el campo
[1:13:45] is something that my papa would always
[1:13:47] say
[1:13:50] that it is the greatest place to be
[1:13:54] i i come come
[1:13:56] with uh with uh for a few minutes
[1:14:00] minutos wanting to with all my heart
[1:14:04] to go and spend a month there in norway
[1:14:10] to go spend another month in uganda
[1:14:51] and that was was what the word of god
[1:14:54] what brought him to to to to be with
[1:14:57] this ministry
[1:15:01] the bible speaks to us
[1:15:04] in the book of saint mark
[1:15:07] chapter 4
[1:15:13] and the same day
[1:15:16] and the same day
[1:15:18] when he was even come on
[1:15:21] he saith unto them let us pass over to
[1:15:26] the other side
[1:15:28] i believe that the word of god it has
[1:15:30] the answer for our days
[1:15:35] i believe that the word of god is real
[1:15:40] i believe that the word of god will
[1:15:41] produce in you what it said it will
[1:15:44] produce
[1:15:47] i believe that the word of god is
[1:16:32] i will draw
[1:16:59] it defends its own self the defendant is
[1:17:03] that's what the word of god will do in
[1:17:05] his life
[1:17:07] if you have problems in your life
[1:17:10] you haven't let the word of god loose
[1:17:14] if you have problems
[1:17:26] we have problems with not believing the
[1:17:28] word of god
[1:17:41] is
[1:17:57] testament of what the holy spirit is
[1:17:59] doing
[1:18:03] i am just a man
[1:18:05] we are just men
[1:18:08] but we are men that believe god
[1:19:05] we not only
[1:19:07] by god's grace we're able to establish
[1:19:09] the church there
[1:19:13] but also by god's grace
[1:19:17] to provide for their future
[1:19:19] fortune
[1:19:21] i told our pastor
[1:19:27] what i'd give to be 20 years younger oh
[1:19:29] come on
[1:19:31] to give to see all these young men
[1:19:46] and now brother mark is 26 years old
[1:19:48] hermano
[1:20:27] by
[1:20:29] what god has done for us today
[1:20:57] and then that's when they probably wish
[1:20:59] they lived in new mexico
[1:21:04] but new mexico
