[18:39] we

[18:43] right after her we have a video from the
[18:45] sunday school
[18:57] god bless you
[19:00] on july the 24th of last year
[19:05] i was in an accident with a horse
[19:37] i knew that it was a miracle
[19:40] that i lived
[19:44] well ribs hurt
[19:47] and eight months later ultra misses
[19:49] espresso i was not feeling like i was
[19:51] getting well you know
[19:55] so two weeks ago i went back to the
[19:58] surgeon
[20:01] and he did a x-ray
[20:05] and he told me my ribs did not go back
[20:07] together
[20:12] they were floating
[20:15] that
[20:16] he could not fix them
[20:20] that he was going to have to send me to
[20:22] a specialist somewhere else for surgery
[20:30] so the next step was to do a cat scan
[20:34] it's again deposited instead of
[20:35] examining cat skin so we did that and
[20:39] my follow-up was monday
[20:44] so i went back to the surgeon lunas
[20:58] i began to pray out loud you come and
[21:00] say
[21:28] so the surgeon comes in yes
[21:31] sits down and he looks at me
[21:33] and he is significant
[21:35] he said
[21:38] your ribs are together
[21:49] that there is the um cartilage and the
[21:53] muscle tissue between the ribs are still
[21:55] healing
[22:23] and i just want to thank the lord jesus
[22:25] so much for this healing
[22:29] and i want to thank everyone who was
[22:31] praying for me
[22:35] okay
[22:36] god bless you

[23:00] if thou knewest the gift to god and who
[23:03] and who is it that saith to thee
[23:06] give me to drink thou that would have
[23:08] asked

[27:14] [Music]
[27:19] we wanted to give a little uh report on
[27:21] how it went and uh
[27:23] i wanted to start off if we could yes
[27:28] by reading a scripture
[27:32] in the scripture is matthew 11 28.
[27:43] and it reads like this is this yasi
[27:47] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[27:49] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[27:59] you know
[28:01] oh you may be seated
[28:06] you know everyone had a had a reason for
[28:08] going on this trip
[28:15] i i did two and and i knew it
[28:20] the uh i was pretty tired
[28:24] um
[28:26] i was pretty tired of uh like the hebrew
[28:28] children going in a circle
[28:37] a circle of my own sin
[28:42] and i remember that scripture that says
[28:43] come unto me all ye that labor and i'm
[28:45] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[28:51] and uh there i realized that there
[28:53] remaineth
[28:55] rest for my soul
[29:10] it would cost me everything that i was
[29:14] as brother danny said a total separation
[29:17] [Music]
[29:20] you know
[29:21] meeting the brothers there seeing how
[29:23] much they love just how much they love
[29:24] you all viendo viendo los hermanos
[29:27] como los amanos how much they love the
[29:29] pastor but moreover how how much they
[29:31] love the lord
[29:36] it really uh it really encouraged me to
[29:38] see
[29:42] [Music]
[29:51] i had got up there and i said that they
[29:52] were they were bold like lions
[29:58] and i actually got a picture of brother
[30:00] tommy
[30:06] we could show it
[30:13] and uh this is what i saw in each one of
[30:15] those men over there yes
[30:20] you know
[30:21] from the first service going there
[30:23] this is
[30:25] it was pastor matthias's church
[30:31] and how brother tommy junior says it
[30:32] ruins you
[30:38] and they ruined me and
[30:40] you know i go in and you hear the the
[30:42] way they worship and you hurt
[30:45] me
[30:47] is
[30:50] that was a you know i feel like
[30:52] in a sense i i wasn't ready
[30:57] it uh it kind of it shook me it made me
[30:59] question
[31:01] me down to my core my
[31:13] my challenge was a little different from
[31:15] others this was the first missionary
[31:17] trip i ever went on
[31:22] i had a my challenge was you know for a
[31:25] long time i've been plagued with you
[31:26] know being a coward
[31:32] i've been scared of getting up here and
[31:34] giving a testimony
[31:40] and uh as i was there i remember i was
[31:42] so shocked that brother caleb was
[31:43] introducing us and
[31:58] the only thing i remember from that
[32:00] service anything that the brother said
[32:05] actually brother caleb
[32:08] it was uh he said he sets the captive
[32:10] free
[32:41] he was reminding me everything he set me
[32:43] free from it
[32:47] i began to realize that you know my job
[32:49] up there was to give a testimony
[32:54] testimonial i began to realize that i
[32:57] wasn't given a testimony but i was
[32:58] making a confession
[33:02] i began to realize that i wasn't even in
[33:04] africa
[33:07] in africa but i was in caesarea philippi
[33:11] de filippo
[33:13] it was the it was a place known as the
[33:15] gates of hell
[33:19] a place known of people eagerly knocking
[33:21] at that door of the gate to hell
[33:35] he presented a clear challenge to them
[33:40] he didn't want his
[33:42] his disciples
[33:43] and running from evil
[33:49] but he wanted them to storm those gates
[33:56] in the bible caesarea philippi is is
[33:58] known for something greater
[34:01] caesarea
[34:03] philippi is
[34:33] and we let the enemy know whose side we
[34:35] were on
[34:39] you know there on the trip i learned the
[34:40] word
[34:41] what what it truly means you know
[34:43] sometimes over here we we
[34:45] overuse it and under appreciate what the
[34:47] word brother means
[34:54] over there they uh
[34:56] i really learned that whenever i was
[34:58] i questioned myself i was in doubt
[35:05] there were my brothers there too to talk
[35:07] me through it to identify with
[35:09] me
[35:10] [Music]
[35:13] there they were to minister to me to
[35:15] pray with me
[35:19] word says that his light will guide us
[35:25] there i saw that light that
[35:28] i saw that light in each one of my
[35:29] brothers
[35:33] not only did it guide those people of
[35:35] africa
[35:37] in africa but when my darkness was
[35:39] trying to set it
[35:46] and it uh not only guided me but it lit
[35:48] a light that i had no idea i had no solo
[35:55] brother danny said on sunday
[36:00] no matter how how long they've been dead
[36:05] how long they've been in darkness
[36:08] you know for 29 years i've been shackled
[37:06] lord
[37:22] the bible says come and see
[37:24] her
[37:38] god bless each and every one of you
[37:42] um
[37:44] i
[37:45] i try to i try i try to search in this
[37:48] whole trip intentions
[37:51] try to search one thing that that really
[37:54] was a great experience and really
[37:55] changed my life
[38:00] and i couldn't find it i it was not one
[38:03] part it was the whole trip
[38:08] that changed my life
[38:11] i am
[38:12] so grateful for my pastor
[38:16] for him i wouldn't be here today
[38:20] for my wife
[38:23] she's her prayers and supporting me it
[38:26] really helped me
[38:30] forgive me i could get very emotional
[38:35] i'd like to thank my parents as well for
[38:36] supporting me
[38:41] it was a wonderful experience
[38:45] that monday when we we weren't able to
[38:47] fly what we were supposed to lunas
[38:53] after we left el paso airport
[38:58] it already felt we were on the trip
[39:02] we were already in the missionary field
[39:06] right left el diablo
[39:10] us individually in category
[39:15] what really was beautiful was
[39:18] brother caleb had said in the beginning
[39:20] he he said on that he said on tuesday
[39:22] then it was the next day we had a
[39:23] meeting here at the church
[39:29] and he was just like sitting he was
[39:30] sitting right he was just talking you
[39:31] know what we're going to have a quick
[39:32] meeting
[39:36] and once he got in the pulpit
[39:40] you could feel the presence of the lord
[39:42] just come down in each and every one of
[39:44] us
[39:47] and the amazing thing about this
[39:49] experience
[39:51] experience like we're going into battle
[39:56] and our general was preparing each and
[39:59] every one of us
[40:02] he chose you he chose you for a reason
[40:04] and a purpose
[40:08] my tears just came out of my mouth
[40:13] i said lord you could have chose anybody
[40:15] else
[40:23] we went to the trip
[40:26] and
[40:29] and it and you see the people
[40:33] and like our brother justin says it
[40:35] ruins you
[40:42] it makes you see the things that you
[40:43] take for granted
[40:49] the desperation of the brothers i i had
[40:52] to pass out the bibles we had some
[40:54] bibles to pass out to every brother
[41:00] yes
[41:00] and they didn't sit they didn't wait on
[41:02] their seats
[41:30] every day we take that for granted
[41:46] and at the end of the the preaching
[41:49] um
[41:50] the brother asked um
[41:53] is anybody sick
[41:58] and this mother she raised up her son
[42:00] yonah
[42:13] and you could feel the presence of the
[42:15] lord right there
[42:19] and as they prayed for the boy
[42:25] after the prayer was finished
[42:28] on she did not have no disappointment
[42:31] but she had faith
[42:35] sometimes we expect things right away
[42:38] when we ask lord for something
[42:43] we sometimes we think for some reason
[42:44] the lord works for us and he doesn't
[42:50] see
[42:52] and
[42:53] just seeing her faith and her
[42:55] desperation for that boy to be healed
[43:02] i see that boy and
[43:03] i
[43:04] i think i thought of my my son my son
[43:09] what if i were in that position
[43:24] son
[43:35] it was just that desperation that faith
[43:38] that pool that they have
[43:44] it was it was supernatural one of the
[43:47] one of the other um
[43:49] greatest moments i had was
[43:51] at the end of whether
[44:01] and at the end at the end of his
[44:02] preaching he told every minister every
[44:05] pastor to grab like a chain
[44:13] and there was such unity
[44:16] and he said
[44:19] he had said
[44:29] that a chain
[44:31] is it strongest at its weakest link
[44:37] and i remember that moment brother jimmy
[44:39] was on my left side recorded
[44:43] and my brother aaron was in my right
[44:44] side
[44:47] and he said let the breeze of the holy
[44:49] spirit dwell upon you
[44:50] desperate
[44:52] brother jim
[44:53] we both felt the holy spirit come to all
[44:56] upon us
[44:59] and it was a calming breeze a joy um
[45:17] one thing
[45:18] one thing is to experience it
[45:20] individually
[45:22] experimental
[45:24] individual
[45:25] but another thing is to experience
[45:27] together as unity
[45:30] experiments i've learned so much in this
[45:33] trip from every young man every man that
[45:36] went aprendi
[45:40] especially for my pastor especially
[45:44] you know us you know sometimes in our in
[45:46] our minds we you know there there was

[45:53] he was wearing this shirt you know it
[45:54] was very
[45:56] you know it was very
[45:58] halloween

[46:11] attention i was walking right by

[46:31] in your mind you know you think these
[46:33] things

[46:46] [Music]
[46:55] out of the teeth

[47:05] it was there
[47:07] but when the gems began to come as the
[47:09] teeth
[47:10] [Music]
[47:12] started to eat
[47:14] and as it ate
[47:16] skin began to cover
[47:20] a body came um because now it's eating
[47:24] yeah so
[47:26] that's when when i saw your shoulder
[47:28] the lord reminded me of that thing
[47:33] that's what it is
[47:42] i told myself i should be ashamed of
[47:44] myself
[47:48] that's probably his now favorite go-to
[47:50] shirt
[47:55] i learned so much and i appreciate each
[47:58] and every one of the brothers that went
[47:59] aprenditanto yeah

[50:24] i'd
[50:33] we had made plans to go on another trip

[51:15] anybody that i was leaving work for a
[51:17] while

[51:41] that point yes
[51:45] um
[51:47] no this this wasn't a vacation at all
[51:51] if anything it was probably one of the
[51:53] most tiring things that i've ever done
[51:55] in my life
[51:59] but if there's one thing for sure but
[52:02] that we went with the
[52:04] [Music]
[52:09] um
[52:10] as soon as
[52:12] two days or the day that we were
[52:14] supposed to leave
[52:24] [Music]
[52:30] a couple days before our trip
[52:34] both of my sons got really sick
[52:39] to the point where the night before we
[52:40] were supposed to leave i was up in the
[52:42] bathroom for about three or four hours
[52:43] with my son josh with the with the
[52:45] shower running on hot
[52:47] saudis
[52:55] and
[52:56] he wasn't able to breathe that night
[52:58] nope
[53:25] and
[53:26] that was a bit of a nightmare for
[53:28] us
[53:32] my copa test came back positive me me
[53:36] positiva the day before we were supposed
[53:38] to
[53:40] leave that night i was actually at
[53:43] justin's house and we were talking yes i
[53:45] noticed having a casa del mano justin
[53:47] establish platincondo we were sharing
[53:48] the notes and all the studying that
[53:50] we've been doing before before this trip
[53:52] compartment
[53:57] that night we were talking about
[53:59] how we have to have faith and who have
[54:00] to be able to speak things yes
[54:04] [Music]
[54:07] and i remember i started getting text
[54:09] messages everyone's saying oh i got my
[54:11] test it's negative
[54:16] negative so at that moment i checked
[54:18] mine and as soon as i opened it it was
[54:21] positive
[54:26] and if i've ever felt my heart sunk to
[54:29] the bottom of my stomach it was that
[54:30] moment
[54:35] that that at that point satan started
[54:36] telling me you're not going on this trip
[54:42] he was telling me that i was undeserving
[54:44] or unworthy to go on a trip like this
[54:49] brother justin was there to keep me up
[54:52] keep my spirit up
[54:56] i called my pastor and i let him know.
[55:01] and he told me something so assuring him
[55:09] [Music]
[55:17] [Music]
[55:34] you know nothing was going to stop the
[55:35] hand of god moving
[55:40] the preview had already been shown yeah
[55:44] and just like the pastor said all those
[55:46] that were in the preview with live
[55:48] action now
[55:55] i want to share with you a dream that
[55:56] the lord gave me
[55:58] [Music]
[56:00] in my dream we were on a big hot air
[56:04] balloon
[56:09] and it was the whole the whole team all
[56:11] 16 of us
[56:14] this is
[56:23] and at the moment he says all right give
[56:25] me give me uh give me the suitcase
[56:29] and he he looks at me and tells me open
[56:31] the door to the basket
[56:35] so i'm here standing and i open the door
[56:37] to the basket
[56:40] and there's a giant suitcase in front of
[56:42] him
[56:56] he was waiting for the right time
[56:58] esperando
[57:00] perfecto and when the right time came he
[57:02] grabbed the suitcase and he dumped all
[57:03] the gold over
[57:14] the next part of the dream
[57:18] i jump off of the basket
[57:23] and i'm looking for the gold because i
[57:24] want to put it in my pocket yes
[57:28] but where i'm looking is really dry it's
[57:30] real dry land
[57:34] but then i stumble across a big body of
[57:36] water
[57:49] [Music]
[58:19] you guys can't hear the sound but no
[58:40] now from the moment uh
[58:42] we drive up to the first service when we
[58:43] get there it was brother matthias's
[58:44] church
[58:48] we're inside the bus and we're a few
[58:49] hundred feet away from the church itself
[58:56] and you can hear them going to town
[58:58] worshiping
[59:03] is something that i had never
[59:04] experienced or heard before
[59:07] experimental everyone thought the same
[59:10] thought as soon as we drove up
[59:13] i said wow you can feel the spirit of
[59:15] the lord moving already
[59:44] so i start to fill my pockets with all
[59:46] this gold
[59:49] and i put in as much as i can carry my
[59:51] pockets
[59:57] and i turn and i start to climb up
[1:00:10] he asked me how was this trip
[1:00:25] i pulled all the gold out of my pocket
[1:00:27] and i gave him a piece emphasis
[1:00:35] brother henry romano henry i started
[1:00:37] giving everybody a piece of gold
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:47] but i know that
[1:00:49] all your work here as a church
[1:00:54] as part of the body of christ
[1:00:57] all your work that you do here for the
[1:00:59] people of uganda

[1:01:08] no
[1:01:12] i don't know when this would happen or
[1:01:15] how no
[1:01:18] but all i can say is that god is the
[1:01:20] interpreter of his own word
[1:01:33] [Music]

[1:05:13] christ the same yesterday and today and
[1:05:16] forever
[1:05:18] jesus
[1:05:33] is
[1:05:43] and the scripture reads like this yes
[1:05:46] but jesus beheld them
[1:05:48] and said unto them
[1:05:50] with men
[1:05:52] this
[1:05:53] is impossible
[1:05:56] but with god
[1:05:57] all things
[1:05:59] are possible in miranda los jesus
[1:06:02] para
[1:06:13] brother seth if you could put the second
[1:06:15] picture please of the the church
[1:06:20] so this here is brother dan's church is
[1:06:33] you know there's there's not much more
[1:06:35] you can say than what the men have
[1:06:36] before may have said
[1:06:41] does it ruin you yes it does
[1:06:43] see was it a great vacation
[1:06:47] no it wasn't
[1:06:49] was it a vacation
[1:06:52] no no
[1:06:53] but where is my brother diego donas
[1:06:56] diego but i will tell you one thing my
[1:06:58] friend
[1:07:40] when i initially got in touch with
[1:07:42] brother caleb that i wanted to go
[1:07:45] in
[1:07:49] they they had made the call you know if
[1:07:51] anyone wanted to go either they wanted
[1:07:53] to eat
[1:07:54] after service
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:13] and i you know i talked to my wife
[1:08:16] you should go
[1:08:19] and so i got in contact with with
[1:08:21] brother caleb
[1:08:29] one of the things that that really got
[1:08:31] me though
[1:08:34] was that i i told my wife
[1:08:51] the year to help serve but
[1:08:55] and that would be to and in my in my
[1:08:57] mind yes
[1:08:59] you know i'd carry brother kale's
[1:09:00] backpack
[1:09:03] carry books
[1:09:16] and i want to thank each and every one
[1:09:18] of you
[1:09:46] but without without your guys's prayers
[1:09:52] it wouldn't have been as successful
[1:09:56] and so from the bottom of my heart i
[1:09:57] want to thank each and every one of you
[1:10:10] you know we sit here and and we sing we
[1:10:13] clap we sit next to each other
[1:10:26] and there was one brother
[1:10:42] and so far
[1:10:45] this is all i know about you
[1:10:51] and i and i said
[1:10:53] you're the treasurer
[1:10:56] so we all know i'm talking about brother
[1:10:58] mark
[1:10:59] questions
[1:11:00] i go you got a really sick maroon suit
[1:11:06] and i know your boys love me
[1:11:10] and and i'll tell you this
[1:11:12] iguesto brother mark adamano mark
[1:11:16] it was an absolute pleasure to get to
[1:11:18] know you better
[1:11:21] if anyone has ever spoken to brother
[1:11:23] meyer
[1:11:38] but to have an opportunity
[1:11:41] to speak with that man
[1:11:44] to hang around him
[1:11:47] you'll realize that that is the one of
[1:11:49] the sweetest men you will ever meet
[1:12:04] you've heard of of the struggles and the
[1:12:06] hard times the different ministers and
[1:12:08] the different brothers have had to just
[1:12:10] get over there
[1:12:16] and it's true
[1:12:19] it was a witness
[1:12:25] i saw the the the airline workers say oh
[1:12:28] no you can't go because your test has to
[1:12:30] be within 24 hours
[1:12:48] and so finally we we get on the plane
[1:12:53] you know we fly to dallas
[1:12:56] and then another thing you have to fill
[1:12:58] out this form
[1:13:01] to be granted permission
[1:13:04] you land in qatar
[1:13:07] qatar and just so many different things
[1:13:12] well we get into into qatar
[1:13:16] or
[1:13:25] which is in uganda
[1:13:26] and uganda and we've already we thought
[1:13:29] okay finally we're done
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:14:03] now most people will use the expression
[1:14:07] that man will give you the shirt off his
[1:14:09] back
[1:14:15] not only will brother sam give you the
[1:14:17] shirt off his back
[1:14:20] but he'll give you the pants off his
[1:14:21] legs
[1:14:23] and the socks
[1:14:26] but by the by brother sam's generosity
[1:14:38] me and brother jim for two days
[1:14:54] that was there at brother dan's church
[1:14:58] obviously you can't see me because i'm
[1:15:00] behind the camera
[1:15:03] but
[1:15:04] you know the chief says hey these are
[1:15:06] the men that are going to preach
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:22] i had blue jeans on
[1:15:26] bartolones i had a white t-shirt on you
[1:15:30] and not a button-up
[1:15:33] not one you would go take outside you
[1:15:35] know
[1:15:48] and
[1:15:49] it was just absolutely phenomenal
[1:15:52] excellent to be a part
[1:15:55] to be a little part
[1:15:57] to be able to see the way the lord moved
[1:16:00] throughout the ministry
[1:16:05] to see how the people were so ready to
[1:16:07] receive but
[1:16:11] and to really be able to just take a
[1:16:12] step back
[1:16:16] and give god
[1:16:32] if you could go to the first picture
[1:16:34] that i had sent you
[1:16:42] it should be a picture of brother tommy
[1:16:52] during the conference
[1:16:54] conference
[1:16:58] when you saw the ministry move when
[1:17:14] you see the ministry speaking the way
[1:17:17] that they would venmos
[1:17:21] or better yet you would see the holy
[1:17:23] spirit speak through the ministry
[1:17:28] and you wouldn't even see the brothers
[1:17:30] anymore
[1:17:34] you wouldn't see like if brother ronnie
[1:17:35] was speaking
[1:17:37] foreign
[1:17:38] we didn't recognize as the brother
[1:17:40] speaking no no no
[1:17:50] and we were we were able to capture one
[1:17:51] of these photos
[1:17:54] of brother tommy junior tomasito and
[1:17:56] brother
[1:18:52] and you can see the brother in the
[1:18:53] background just taking notes
[1:19:00] hunting for souls
[1:19:03] for christ
[1:19:04] god bless you
[1:19:30] god bless you this evening
[1:19:32] well please stand and i'll just read one
[1:19:34] short scripture
[1:19:38] it is found in the book of psalms
[1:19:42] chapter 38
[1:19:44] chapter 34 verse 8
[1:19:50] it says oh taste and see that the lord
[1:19:52] is good
[1:19:53] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[1:20:03] amen you may be seated i mean
[1:20:07] i just want to say that i'm so
[1:20:09] it's such an honor to be identified with
[1:20:12] people such as yourselves
[1:20:17] i'm so grateful that the lord opened a
[1:20:19] door for me to go back to africa
[1:20:25] he never ceases to amaze me
[1:20:30] you know i made the decision that i was
[1:20:32] going to go avi
[1:20:35] and that next day
[1:20:38] we haven't had any covet cases through
[1:20:40] the whole pandemic
[1:21:11] and i'm the one who's in charge of doing
[1:21:12] all the testing and reporting that stuff
[1:21:14] to the state
[1:21:20] but i had already made the decision i
[1:21:22] was going
[1:21:25] and anytime you're going to do something
[1:21:26] for the lord
[1:21:29] and when you have the the plans in your
[1:21:31] hands
[1:21:35] you can bet you can be assured that
[1:21:37] there's going to be a fight on your
[1:21:38] hands
[1:21:40] there will be a fight on your hands
[1:21:45] you know before i went on this trip
[1:21:50] i was looking at some land establish
[1:21:54] and so i called a realtor that was
[1:21:56] listed on this land
[1:22:01] and she was giving me some information
[1:22:03] on it
[1:22:05] and at the end of our conversation i was
[1:22:07] giving her my email
[1:22:12] and my email reads pillar of fire 65 at
[1:22:16] gmail
[1:22:17] electronic
[1:22:18] fuego
[1:22:22] and so you know after i gave her the
[1:22:23] email address
[1:22:27] she said are you a christian
[1:22:30] cristiano and i said yes ma'am i sure am
[1:22:36] there is a there's an anointing behind
[1:22:37] that email address
[1:22:42] and so we begin talking about the lord
[1:22:44] and consequence
[1:22:47] and i told her that we'd i'd be coming
[1:22:49] on a on a trip to africa
[1:22:54] and without hesitation
[1:22:58] this lady said i want to give you
[1:23:00] whatever money you need to get to africa
[1:23:12] you told me that you'd be praying for me
[1:23:14] and that for me is good enough
[1:23:17] for me
[1:23:32] she said if we could be there tomorrow
[1:23:34] we would go
[1:23:37] yes
[1:23:38] and she said so i want to write you a
[1:23:39] check for eighteen hundred dollars
[1:23:44] and she said and you use it however you
[1:23:45] feel that to use it
[1:23:50] [Music]
[1:23:56] [Music]
[1:24:13] my boss calls me in the office
[1:24:17] who's my grandpa
[1:24:20] and he said hey i have some good news
[1:24:21] for you
[1:24:23] he said they finally approved your raise
[1:24:28] and he
[1:24:31] but you're going to get back paid from
[1:24:32] six months back when you started that
[1:24:34] position
[1:24:39] so what's amazing about that is i didn't
[1:24:41] even have the pto the paid time off to
[1:24:43] go
[1:24:48] and i really didn't need it at that
[1:24:49] point
[1:24:52] so i want to thank the lord for doing
[1:24:54] that for me
[1:24:58] as you heard we weren't able to leave on
[1:25:00] that first monday because our we weren't
[1:25:02] able to get through with our covet tests
[1:25:14] and so on our way back from the airport
[1:25:18] we're coming back to las cruces
[1:25:21] and we're going to exit right there off
[1:25:23] to get on trans mountain is
[1:25:38] so she starts to veer into the lane
[1:25:42] and as soon as she gets in the lane to
[1:25:43] get off on the exit
[1:25:47] there is a semi in front of us
[1:25:51] and he puts his brakes on
[1:26:05] and so my reaction is to look in the
[1:26:07] rearview mirror
[1:26:12] and i see this man
[1:26:14] picking up a little boy off the road
[1:26:19] and it turns out he was riding a
[1:26:20] motorcycle
[1:26:23] he was riding a motorcycle
[1:26:26] and he had the little boy on the front
[1:26:27] of his bike
[1:26:32] so when he hit us
[1:26:34] all he could do is grab his son
[1:26:39] and the bike at 65 miles an hour the
[1:26:41] bike just slides on its side and just
[1:26:42] comes to a stop yes
[1:26:54] and it just so happened i had all my
[1:26:55] nursing gear because i had a first aid
[1:26:57] kit
[1:27:02] for the
[1:27:03] helios so we got the kid cleaned up
[1:27:08] he had busted his head pretty good
[1:27:12] but they were both okay
[1:27:16] and so you know we just got back on the
[1:27:18] road and
[1:27:19] us
[1:27:21] and you know some people might have said
[1:27:22] well maybe that's a sign you probably
[1:27:24] shouldn't be going
[1:27:29] but once you see yourself in the vision
[1:27:34] it don't matter what happens
[1:27:38] the actors are still the same amen
[1:27:44] i have testimony after testimony
[1:27:47] testimonial
[1:27:49] testimony one that really stood out to
[1:27:51] me was
[1:27:54] brother diego had shared a vision el
[1:27:57] hermano diego compartio
[1:27:59] the holy spirit was going to come down
[1:28:01] and fall upon these ministers
[1:28:08] it was going to sweep across the country
[1:28:17] so i was thinking it was going to come
[1:28:19] down in such a way that these people
[1:28:21] were going to be jumping and shouting
[1:28:22] and and
[1:28:24] what i would think the holy spirit would
[1:28:26] what you do you know
[1:28:41] that these people they didn't even know
[1:28:42] what to do with it
[1:28:45] they were trying to fight it
[1:28:49] someone tried to get out of hand but
[1:28:50] they just couldn't
[1:28:53] say
[1:28:53] that
[1:28:56] and there wasn't much emotion going on
[1:29:00] you could tell these people were eating
[1:29:06] and
[1:29:07] you know as we were
[1:29:08] getting to uh on another note we were
[1:29:10] getting to uh
[1:29:15] qatar
[1:29:16] and another part of the vision that was
[1:29:19] shared with us
[1:29:24] is that we were going into uganda and in
[1:29:26] uganda that country is ruled by a spirit
[1:29:28] of like a bull
[1:29:31] uganda
[1:29:50] so when somebody comes on their
[1:29:52] territory
[1:29:55] they get very violent
[1:29:59] and so we're on the but you know the
[1:30:01] vision said don't fear because i see you
[1:30:03] all coming in on a
[1:30:12] and our pastor said just as eliezer went
[1:30:15] and pulled out a bride on a camel
[1:30:18] come on
[1:30:27] so will you all be coming in on a camel
[1:30:29] to take the bride out of africa portion
[1:30:32] of the prize
[1:30:58] and i'm just taking back to the vision
[1:31:00] of what was told to us
[1:31:05] and he said as this bull wants to get
[1:31:07] you all and tear you apart and kill you
[1:31:14] he can't do it
[1:31:16] he knows you're there he's aware of you
[1:31:18] all yes
[1:31:21] but the holy spirit covered you from
[1:31:23] this bull perro
[1:31:27] and so if he could put the picture of
[1:31:29] the money up
[1:31:32] and so on top here we have some uh
[1:31:35] they're called the
[1:31:37] pitarian riles and that's their currency
[1:31:47] it has a picture of a camel
[1:31:50] and i was looking at this these uh
[1:31:53] this currency and it started to just
[1:31:54] preach to me
[1:32:03] and you're going to the pearl of africa
[1:32:05] which is uganda
[1:32:09] and in this middle photo here you see a
[1:32:11] a pearl inside of an oyster shell
[1:32:17] and he said you're coming on a camel to
[1:32:19] search out that pearl of great price
[1:32:28] and you see this ship here
[1:32:32] a camel is actually known as the ship of
[1:32:34] the desert
[1:32:42] it's because of the way they walk they
[1:32:44] move both legs on one side at the same
[1:32:46] time so if they're going forward
[1:33:06] here
[1:33:33] you see they're so poor
[1:33:41] in fact the vision even said that we
[1:33:42] haven't even seen the dark side of
[1:33:44] uganda every time we go i know
[1:33:54] the last part that was really
[1:33:55] outstanding to me
[1:33:59] was
[1:34:00] as brother felipe had shared that vision
[1:34:03] of the skull
[1:34:05] felipe
[1:34:09] he showed the video
[1:34:12] and
[1:34:13] the part that was amazing is how the
[1:34:15] lord had already shown brother diego
[1:34:16] that that was going to take place
[1:34:22] and that these people would now have
[1:34:24] teeth to be able to eat and nurture
[1:34:26] themselves
[1:34:32] and you know as we were sitting in that
[1:34:34] uh pastor's conference
[1:34:38] the highlight of my trip was just
[1:34:40] watching these brothers eat
[1:34:42] the highlight of my trip was watching
[1:34:44] these brothers
[1:34:58] it was a great joy and honor to be there
[1:35:01] with my brothers and
[1:35:02] grand
[1:35:05] and i'm just so grateful for the
[1:35:06] opportunity to speak to you all this
[1:35:08] evening
[1:35:34] amen would you please stand
[1:35:38] hear the lord jesus
[1:35:40] hand clap of praise
[1:35:46] for keeping our brothers safe and
[1:35:47] bringing them back may god bless you my
