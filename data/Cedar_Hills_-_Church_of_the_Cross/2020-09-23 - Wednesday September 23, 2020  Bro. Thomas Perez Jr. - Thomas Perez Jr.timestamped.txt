[19:26] [Music]
[19:27] [Applause]
[19:35] thank you for a very good job very great
[19:38] job
[19:39] tonight
[19:42] and grateful to the lord jesus
[19:49] we have been hearing some messages that
[19:52] are just
[19:53] out of this world
[19:58] and we want to thank the lord jesus
[19:59] christ
[20:01] and god's servant our pastor for the for
[20:05] for the word that has been coming forth
[20:07] out of this desk
[20:11] or video that that you can see for the
[20:13] for for it's about two
[20:14] hours two hours no it's about two
[20:18] minutes
[20:23] go ahead if you would
[20:34] there was a recent study by the center
[20:36] for bible engagement
[20:37] where they pulled 40 000 uh
[20:41] general population in the u.s from eight
[20:43] to eighty
[20:44] and they just wanted to see how we are
[20:47] engaging with scripture
[20:48] right and they discovered the study
[20:50] right um
[20:52] when we're in the scripture one time a
[20:54] week and that could be church on sunday
[20:55] that's
[20:56] pastor saying you open your bible we
[20:58] hear the message
[20:59] one time a week had negligible effect on
[21:02] some key areas of your life so
[21:04] i'm gonna spell that out more here in a
[21:05] moment two times a week
[21:08] negligible effect now at three times a
[21:10] week there was a blip on the map like
[21:13] there was a heartbeat something
[21:15] happened you would expect that it'd be
[21:18] one
[21:18] two i mean there'd be a gradual link
[21:20] line on the effect an impact that would
[21:22] have in your life
[21:23] but it was literally one two three four
[21:26] something radically happens
[21:28] okay you got my curiosity to this extent
[21:30] what kind of behavior is being effective
[21:32] uh bitterness in relationships marriage
[21:34] a relationship with your kids and so on
[21:37] drops 40 percent alcoholism
[21:40] drops 57 feeling spiritually hurtfully
[21:44] stagnant
[21:44] ask them the question how much time do
[21:46] you spend in the scripture
[21:48] if they're in the scripture four times a
[21:49] week or more it drops 60 percent
[21:51] wow viewing pornography drops 61
[21:55] that's very important now on a flip
[21:58] positive side
[21:59] sharing your faith jumps 200 percent
[22:02] wow because you have a confidence in
[22:03] god's word and then discipling others
[22:06] jumps 230
[22:07] that's that's amazing right there
[22:14] [Music]
[22:27] i'm going to ask you to stand once again
[22:28] and you thought we were just here just
[22:30] to spend time
[22:35] prosper to the coming of the lord
[22:38] prosperous
[22:42] we're going to go into a into a book
[22:43] that that that that i don't very
[22:46] go very often into and i don't know
[22:48] about you but i don't
[22:52] know
[22:58] very happy to have my wife with us here
[23:00] tonight
[23:04] and i told her if she didn't if she
[23:09] if she wouldn't come back soon
[23:14] that that we'd have to put a visitor or
[23:16] guest tag on her
[23:17] well that that
[23:21] you know if he didn't have her we'd be
[23:24] in
[23:24] in a lot of trouble so we did
[23:29] a problem we're grateful to her for for
[23:33] her her faithfulness and what she but i
[23:36] but i thank her for
[23:37] coming to be with me tonight
[23:42] [Applause]
[23:47] or then will i turn to the people a pure
[23:49] language
[23:50] that they may all call upon the name of
[23:53] the toast
[23:59] lord jesus we're grateful to be in your
[24:01] house tonight
[24:07] we ask father that your word will
[24:09] accomplish the purpose that it was sent
[24:11] for tonight
[24:16] and may you receive all honor in all
[24:18] glory
[24:21] gloria for you are the only devil
[24:25] but be thus saith the lord
[24:30] we place ourselves in your hands until
[24:32] you may be seated
[24:35] amen amen how many have been enjoying
[24:38] the word of god
[24:42] here here my uncle abraham here our
[24:45] pastor here
[24:46] the all the different brothers that are
[24:48] the most privileged people upon the face
[24:50] of the world
[24:54] i'm not saying that there aren't other
[24:55] people that are privileged
[25:13] do you know what the word of god does in
[25:15] your heart
[25:19] you know what it does in your soul and i
[25:22] so much appreciated brother henry that
[25:24] that was probably the best message
[25:26] i've ever heard him preach
[25:40] that i have heard and have read
[25:46] and it says don't never let your
[25:47] testimony be negative
[25:52] let it be positive all the time
[25:58] he he would never let us say that he had
[26:01] a stroke
[26:05] because he he he believed with all of
[26:07] his heart
[26:18] we don't give him we don't we don't give
[26:20] a testimony and said this is what the
[26:22] devil did to us
[26:26] don't never let your testimony be
[26:29] negative
[26:32] will make you go crazy
[26:36] too much of the wrong thing will make
[26:39] you go crazy
[26:45] now you've heard our pastor and i'm
[26:47] going to probably go over
[26:48] a few things that that he has he has
[26:50] spoken to us
[26:55] that's great that's wonderful
[26:59] to now impart it to somebody else
[27:20] which the author says i believe it is
[27:25] then this nation is morally bankrupt and
[27:28] emotionally
[27:29] immature
[27:46] can't keep a
[28:01] you find that all the time everywhere
[28:03] you go
[28:06] something so easily like should i go to
[28:08] church it's sunday
[28:09] think so easily like i'm sick who should
[28:12] i call
[28:13] i'll go
[28:27] until he saw the person without feet
[28:32] unstable
[28:36] in established emotional mental health
[28:38] it is
[28:39] failure of maturity is in the fire and
[28:52] they decided that they were going to
[28:54] keep prayer out of school
[29:05] what did they expect when they rejected
[29:08] god
[29:09] from out of the equation
[29:15] when we ourselves understand the word of
[29:18] god
[29:20] that is word would remain eternal
[29:24] what happens when you take the ten
[29:26] commandments out of the school
[29:30] what happens when you take the ten
[29:32] commandments out of the court system
[29:36] what happens when you take god out of
[29:52] our emotions will tell us that we have
[29:54] to be happy when we're sad
[29:58] i come to church with a sureness of
[30:01] faith
[30:04] which started a good working community
[30:20] we're talking about
[30:48] that
[31:01] but let me tell you our children see us
[31:04] up or down
[31:07] and they've got to know where the
[31:09] stability that the
[31:11] answer for our day generator will
[31:14] produce
[31:15] the same effect evaporator
[31:26] it says this for i have received of the
[31:28] lord
[31:30] that also which i delivered unto you
[31:33] that the lord jesus the same night in
[31:35] which he was betrayed
[31:36] took bread when he had given
[31:40] thanks gracias he break it
[31:44] and said
[31:56] he tells us in saint john that he was
[31:58] the bread
[31:59] that he is the bread of life that came
[32:02] down from heaven he's telling the people
[32:04] that he
[32:04] is giving out what he has received
[32:12] in other words if he
[32:36] have not received anything else
[32:39] except the eternal what and and you know
[32:43] you you see him there at the rest home
[32:49] he gave himself for us
[32:54] paranos
[32:56] amen he gave himself
[32:59] for us
[33:03] but this was a man that left everything
[33:22] come help me what do you receive from
[33:26] the message of the hour
[33:28] that's the same thing that he delivered
[33:30] to us
[33:33] there was nothing else but what
[34:04] which is broken
[34:17] breaks off of peace
[34:43] but this body was broken
[34:49] and he said that every time you do this
[34:51] for me jonathan
[34:55] what i did for you in my body
[35:00] that's what jesus is saying just look at
[35:02] jesus
[35:03] remember how i took you out of sin
[35:07] remember how i healed you
[35:10] remember when i gave you the holy ghost
[35:29] the word of god doesn't say this is my a
[35:32] great thing
[35:35] because it would be quickly
[35:39] but he said this was my body which was
[35:40] broken
[36:10] and all of a sudden we come to church
[36:14] and because we don't up yet but i want
[36:17] to tell you
[36:18] get out of this that the bread of god
[36:20] afflicts
[36:23] it'll bring out the best in you
[36:27] and i'll pressure you it'll bring you to
[36:30] the place
[36:35] that's why many people can't eat this
[36:37] bread
[36:39] that's why many people can't can't do
[36:42] what is required
[36:45] that's why in church people act one way
[36:47] and outside they act a different way
[36:52] because anyways outside brother i can i
[36:55] can relax
[37:02] can you imagine a person
[37:05] that tries to serve god and serve the
[37:07] devil
[37:10] you can't do it unless you add
[37:13] leaven to your life
[37:17] it's all right if i cut my hair
[37:20] you just
[37:53] and he thinks he's the only one says
[37:55] that that the minister's not right no
[37:57] more
[38:00] and the children said we didn't like the
[38:02] bread
[38:16] i
[38:19] [Applause]
[38:30] or
[38:57] after a while we can't sing as loud
[39:00] anymore
[39:03] for a while we can't we can't work for
[39:05] the lord no more
[39:09] you know why the world creeps in
[39:12] the moon
[39:53] the word of god
[39:59] when brother branham says that one man
[40:01] one woman out of line can cause the
[40:03] whole church to face
[40:07] because you know why little levin came
[40:10] in
[40:13] it's all right to do all of these things
[40:17] it wasn't all right in the beginning
[40:20] in the beginning we went to hear god's
[40:23] word
[40:26] remember when you came out of egypt
[40:32] amen remember when you came out of egypt
[40:44] where were you when that man went to go
[40:46] pick you up
[41:37] you remember when you came into the
[41:39] message how you'd hear tapes
[41:45] they're foreign
[42:00] you remember
[42:13] and the reason it doesn't penetrate
[42:17] because the world has creeped in
[42:21] and when the world creeped in with
[42:23] leaven
[42:26] god went right out and you tried the
[42:29] same
[42:30] rapper and one day we will go to church
[42:36] for the last time i want to receive the
[42:39] holy ghost
[42:41] the holy ghost has gone in especially
[42:44] yesterday our sincerity went out
[42:49] you know every day we should remind
[42:51] ourselves
[42:53] what we were okay and what were
[43:24] but
[43:31] what happens a little bit at a time i
[43:34] don't mean that disrespect
[43:35] that's okay i understand you're my buddy
[43:38] we all know those things
[43:41] what happens is a little leaven that las
[43:44] cruces is too far
[43:48] and i have to check my life
[43:52] i'm coming to hear his
[43:53] [Applause]
[44:19] and all of a sudden brother branham
[44:23] tells us
[44:25] if you've got the nature of god in you
[44:27] there there's even a scriptures to say
[44:29] to
[44:29] shun all appearance of evil
[44:47] if you've got the nature of god in you
[44:51] for the right thing you'll do the right
[44:55] thing
[44:56] you will think the right way you'll live
[44:59] the right thing if you're a
[45:16] nobody gonna tell me to raise my hands
[45:21] you just got a little levin in your in
[45:23] yourself
[45:25] i don't need nobody to tell me to raise
[45:26] my hands
[45:29] but sometimes people need to be helped
[45:33] can you smile you raise your hand
[45:37] say glory to god can you wave your hand
[45:41] these are free people that like christ
[45:45] i ascent again
[45:48] i gotta say it again if you lie if
[45:50] you're a christian
[45:51] christian you like christ
[45:55] he's your bridegroom yeah
[46:13] we heard sunday about clothes the
[46:16] clothes
[46:16] never wore out
[46:22] this is this is one of the greatest one
[46:25] some of the greatest things that we hear
[46:30] but in verse three he says what is this
[46:32] thing
[46:33] to a point unto them that mourn in zion
[46:39] to give them beauty for ashes
[46:43] many want to give them all give your all
[46:46] your toils all your problems everything
[46:49] that you have to do
[46:50] the oil of joy for morning
[47:09] says you sing songs of joy
[47:12] when the minister says how many love the
[47:16] lord
[47:17] get up out of your chairs
[47:36] you're probably going to have oil on
[47:38] your clothes right
[47:43] okay if you're a barber you're
[47:45] definitely going to have hair on your
[47:47] clothes
[47:49] everybody distinguishes you by what
[47:52] clothes you wear
[47:57] and when you come to the house of the
[47:58] lord
[48:02] but when you come to the house of the
[48:04] lord
[48:16] when you speak and you say hallelujah
[48:20] he gave you his whole life
[48:26] don't ever forget when he came
[48:31] yo perdido
[48:59] so that you could sit where you're at
[49:01] right now
[49:04] so when i sit in my cushion
[49:10] who's a christian
[49:41] and the little boy that was being burned
[49:43] to see jesus in a few minutes
[49:49] you know why do this and remembrance of
