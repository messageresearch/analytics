here content it's been a little while since you're here but we are very very happy to be able to come all the believers that have come from different places [Applause] i uh i'm gonna ask my wife if she would stand well this is my wife my family my daughters with family [Applause] amen thankful to god for with my family and like brother marshall likes to say i love my wife you all want amen amen we're very happy all those that were able to come from las cruces would you stand solos god bless you thank you for your efforts [Applause] as i said those that have come from different places god bless you definitely as we start this message we we also want to greet those that are online and blessed a beggar came and sat before [Music] and i began to tell him of all the types of bread that there were yeah i told him everything i knew about bread i spoke of flour and wheat grain and barley my knowledge even impressed me as i cited the measurements and the recipes but i looked up and i was surprised that he was not smiling i just want bread how wise for the kid i applaud his choice [Music] and i read them the recipe from the cookbook of life he wanted to hear me speak so i asked him would you like to hear me speak here he said no no i just want friends oh why up and i know one who adds two spoons of salt rather than one joke i know another whose oven is three degrees too hot they call it bread but it's look back at me and shrugged his shoulders and said i guess i just lost my appetite i shook my head and returned to my office what a the world is just desiring jesus you will not let's and i want to read verse 3 and then we'll go to verse 4 and then 14. and i've been hitting a few series a few messages on this series and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be that is when one stone shall not be left upon another and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world is amen may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated i many times it is a word that brings a lot of fear into people the bible is full of phrases that talks about the last and each one of those phrases deals with time [Music] the more the moment we see pandemic [Music] we do not have the knowledge the wisdom of what these words which simply how many of you have doomsday phobias if you hear the end of the world oh my god your palms get sweaty [Music] oh you get a little nervous is there anybody here you watch you watch too much cnn and what happens oh you start to go crazy you become like a neurotic my goodness we're at the end but let me tell you without understanding without knowledge it will destroy us yes sir yes yoshi hosea 4 6 says this jose my people are destroyed because of world war two my people are destroyed that nobody says it says my peoples are destroyed for lack of knowledge without knowledge of what is happening or what is going to happen us neurotic it makes us so nervous it gets us to feeling a certain way paranoid depressed and everything else happened what is happening and we must know what is going on when we know what's going to happen there's one thing for sure we will not [Music] [Music] that right i mean there's a lot of people out there there's a lot of preachers which is pretty cool there's a lot of so-called prophets there's a lot of people out there jesus simply is telling you take heed that no man you're going to hear of wars and rumors of war but see that you'd be not troubled bro and the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then the end will come now i have to get this and make sure that you understand me where i'm going because i often associated verse three where it says and what's the sign of the coming and of the end of the world but in verse 14 and then shall the end says and the more i looked at that the more i realized that that's not true those are two different words but it talks about the end of the world the greek word is one thing is the end of the world [Music] okay we begin everybody got that so far we want to learn this morning in revelations 1 8 an apocalypse jesus simply is saying this jesus implemented he says we know the scribe was was john juan but these words are jesus speaking jesus and i am omega omega ah tell your neighbor why are we fearful of them because to see jesus christ in everything in spanish brother henry help us out in espanol he says i am alpha you say omega ah there we go now yo soy el masculine alpha et alpha as the time but because we're creatures of time we are finished we always think of it oh my gosh the end of the world disaster it's the end of all things what the bible says he that endureth unto the end it doesn't say he that endureth to the end of the world it says he that endureth unto thee [Music] look established he that endureth unto the goal that endureth unto the point that is aimed at well he that endureth unto the end result he that endureth until the fulfillment of prophets until the supreme end of god's plan in man is finished the same shall be saved what is the end result that is that that is my subtitles we don't have an and church no tenemos pin iglesia listen to me we don't have an end come on you know the greatest spirit that there is in a church the greatest bad spirit i should say in the church can somebody tell me what it is no no what is it that should be the spirit that should be cast out yes you know why because in every church you get a a little bit of a religious spirit the spiritual relationship i've been in the message my whole life but do you have an expected well i'm a child of one of the one of the preachers a religious spirit will tell you that you're okay but when the power of almighty you're not getting it no i want to make sure you get it you gotta know i'm not sitting in church my whole life waiting to see esperanto if i got enough brownie points i feel good i well i go to church every sunday i'm going to say it again church the bride of christ is not everybody we got to make sure then by the end of the service that you know what your end is yours shall be preached in all the world for a witness [Music] it is the end result come on somebody's gotta say i have a ride what is there to fear [Applause] i want you to get this because this is important once again they asked about the end of the world but he answers them by pointing them to the end in other words who himself what shall be the sign of thy coming no that's the seventh still you want to know what will be the sign of my coming he's telling you this when the full perfect complete word has been restored preach for a witness then the the end is or only through the preaching of the gospel of this kingdom being preached in all the world can a universal bride be made right it is christ in her that is how many know that god will that god he he wants the best for you tell your neighbor god wants the best god has a strategy and his strategy is to fulfill his plan he has the computers to plan i want to know how many of you are in his plan what in the message perfect faith by perfect weakness god's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them oh hallelujah oh my goodness i want to know how many empty vessels are here when's the last time you shook the world religious spirit you says you're doing okay yeah you preach you're okay i'm not looking for that you know i want to shake the world at pentecost what did he do it taken them 10 days to get all emptied out and the religious spirit in the church says you don't need to do that you don't need to fast get yourself ready you're okay lesbian you'll be fine until the coming of the lord there's a religious spirit [Music] and that religious spirit can blow both ways because they can tell you that you're okay or it can also tell you you're not good enough i let's see where this takes us as we continue reading here took him 10 days to get all emptied out they was all standing there with their vessels turned up god you might say well brother they died natural death the natural day of course but they came through to an expectation they weren't looking what was going to happen to this body they knew that by giving themselves completely over to christ they knew what their end would be i find people struggling with that so much i don't know what my end is going to be wait a minute in the gospel of saint thompson he said in the place of the beginning of the principle it is the place of the enemy i don't know if you got that or not i'm going to say it again this isn't the face of the beginning of the principle come on now it's time to not play church anymore we gotta get ready we gotta finish ready i don't know about you but i got it and the people that have stayed praying we don't preach to try to make a good message hogwash yesterday come on tell your neighbors why don't you start by shaking your own little world hello everybody shake your own words quit acting like everything is okay because we pay our ties and offers that's not it you can take it off your friends it's not about a man shows up to the gates of heaven and and if you get enough points you can come in okay he was real religious you got to get a hundred points oh my well let me start two points [Music] wow what else you got okay i i was a good provider i'll give you one point by that time the man says at this pace it's not come on tell your neighbor again foreign [Applause] jeremiah 29 11 says or i know you'll say the thoughts [Music] the scripture portrays israel in the natural but it portrays you and i in the spirit for i know listen listen here now for i know the intentions [Music] to give you a future god [Music] the but eternity that this is the end of yourself i'm here suffering for something let me see your hands it doesn't matter what it is look at the hands that have gone up confess he says this is the end of your sickness it has blood clots in her lungs come on now we were in africa in africa and there was there was five girls that were demon-possessed and they were disrupting the services and i said where are you taking this we're taking them to a hut i said take us wherever they're at the gospel is esperanto your how [Applause] right he is amen he promised him that's not brother caleb he probably promised works that i could use today the answer is pray in jesus name that you would return it would come down to each other individual lord as the word has been spoken and you may be seated [Applause] what kind of people should we be a people that know um and the lord answered me and said for the vision is yet for an appointed how can a vision speak now i want you to get this captain i'm going to make this declaration i've made this before declaration look at your life right now immediately nobody else knows that knows the intricate the the intimate details of your life things that you struggle with within yourself but i want to tell you this that sometimes we look at our life and we made mistakes but maybe you're not very happy with the results are you talking to anybody here if i look at that mirror and i tell you this that if what you see is not what you saw then what [Music] his brother said let's get rid of this guy where did joseph find him jose in a pit an imposter left to die here this morning that's in the pit yeah [Music] he found himself a dream interpreted did you see what she did to me you look at me so come on church you're not close to the video but when you can forgive somebody you don't know what they did to me i know what the blood of jesus christ what do that's what satan is trying to do oh freedom of speech for everyone as long as you're on their agenda when you speak against what they have going on yeah you're a bigot you're a racist what's going on satan everybody people start getting uncomfortable i'm going to say it again let me tell you according to the scripture [Music] is this is something so tremendous well i'm just a church member you're not called to preach up here but you still got to preach i want you to listen closely to this revelations chapter four number three all right there were voices in the library oh [Music] walking around in the hello everybody we come to church and all we jump a little bit and dance is and they want to have a relationship with god can i just have like 10 minutes is that okay just let me just try to finish this the best that i can i don't want to leave you hanging that's the thunder against the enemies you don't care how much you jump how much you can just as sweet as can it's about time that we started the holy ghost was given for as soon as he gets his church in speaking condition well if the pastor says it then that's what it is okay that's okay but when are you going to speak come on church vamos iglesia when are you going to speak it's time for you to say he gets now we turn the corner we are everything and you fulfill a portion of the scripture no one else can fulfill it but you must put the completed when you fulfill it through your life that is the vision speaking of a time to draw that's what the ministry of the seventh angel was about hello everybody because we were all a bunch of

sure what his end would be but over here i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept but when i emptied myself means that it has limits and boundaries it comes from the same root word as finish once again comes from the same root and here's paul saying i have finished my course in other words i am done with the finances now i'm stepping in jesus said i have glorified thee on earth and i have finished yet terminator the work that thou gave us and on the cross he says it is [Music] he says quote to me genesis 1 1. the word was with in the beginning you're looking at me
