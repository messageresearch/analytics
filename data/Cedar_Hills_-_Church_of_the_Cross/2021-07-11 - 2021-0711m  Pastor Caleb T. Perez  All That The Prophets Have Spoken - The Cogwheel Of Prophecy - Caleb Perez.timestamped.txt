[40:47] the bitter kiss of death or
[40:51] walk through chilly jordan just to enter
[40:54] into rest
[40:56] but i did say i'd be
[40:59] waiting on the other side

[43:32] there's a different purpose behind it
[43:35] and i'd like to
[43:36] to start this series and put a platform
[43:39] foundation this week
[43:43] and i'd like to entitle it all that the
[43:46] prophets have spoken
[43:51] we'll find out exactly
[43:58] amen so we look we look forward to what
[44:01] the lord has for us
[44:48] yes
[45:02] how important it is to know that the
[45:04] scriptures
[45:07] they are authentic they are true
[45:11] that is god in letter forms
[45:14] understand young people i
[45:29] and know one thing that god
[45:53] when we come into the house of the lord
[45:57] it's a it's a very serious
[46:00] and and should be a holy experience
[46:06] and sometimes that we want to wait to
[46:08] start a message
[46:12] sometimes we come into the into the
[46:13] sanctuary
[46:16] and uh we have our phones on it
[46:20] you know and and after a while
[46:24] it's not just the phones that go off in
[46:26] the middle of service
[46:40] people that check their facebooks whose
[46:43] facebooks
[46:44] their emails
[46:47] even check the news what's going on
[46:53] i want to tell you it is so
[46:55] disrespectful to the holy ghost
[46:59] when the word is coming forth
[47:03] i remember even our our founding pastor
[47:07] somebody getting up to go to the
[47:08] bathroom in the middle of a sermon
[47:12] that was a no-no no no and he would say
[47:15] you you disturb the holy ghost when you
[47:17] do that
[47:22] so let's not grieve the holy ghost
[47:27] i'm asking you that when you walk
[47:29] through those doors
[47:32] okay let's have some respect
[47:42] imagine them doing the service of the
[47:44] lord and imagination during their
[47:46] sacrifices
[47:48] in the middle of a sacrifice hold on
[47:50] hold on yeah
[48:02] we should conduct ourselves as such
[48:08] and i will tell the deacons police
[48:10] you're the policeman of the church
[48:11] police
[48:14] somebody has their phone oh brother i
[48:17] have the bible app

[48:42] the
[48:43] i was sitting listening to the bible app
[48:53] and all of a sudden the holy spirit
[48:54] speaks to me
[48:56] and he says do you know how much more
[48:59] you'd get out of it
[49:10] yeah just let them do it let's not the
[49:12] easier time we can have is what we go to
[49:14] right
[49:17] nothing wrong if you're on your way to
[49:18] work hearing the scriptures that's okay
[49:20] nothing wrong with that
[49:22] when you get by yourself words come from
[49:26] your mom
[49:28] read it and say bless the lord oh my
[49:31] soul
[49:33] because the man that's reading it to you
[49:35] is saying bless the lord oh my soul

[54:20] not just by eyesight
[54:50] then the question continues can you
[54:53] identify yourself in scripture
[54:57] that's what we want to find out he wants
[55:01] to be known as the identified christ of
[55:04] all the ages
[55:13] but can you identify him in the
[55:15] scriptures right now
[55:29] we hear many times that we don't really
[55:32] need the old testament
[55:34] you've ever heard that no necessity to
[55:37] read the old testament
[55:39] we're not living under the covenant of
[55:41] the law anymore
[55:44] i've said it time and time again
[56:00] if you don't understand
[56:11] brother aj next to him you're going to
[56:12] be
[56:14] daniel chapter one verse three and four
[56:17] okay so have it ready

[56:33] there you go or
[56:36] whatsoever things were written a fourth
[56:38] time
[56:39] that's the things that were written in
[56:40] the old testament
[56:44] written for our learning what were they
[56:46] written for
[56:48] who's learning about it i looking to say
[56:52] that was written for my learning
[56:56] that we through patience and comfort of
[56:59] the scriptures
[57:00] might have my goodness this is how we're
[57:03] going to have hope okay
[57:06] my whole goal of this is to make you
[57:09] fall so in love with the lord
[57:13] i want you to fall so in love with the
[57:15] scriptures
[57:17] that you can't wait to get up in the
[57:19] morning and read your bible
[57:21] [Music]
[57:23] that you can't wait to get up and during
[57:25] the day just get
[57:26] over some notes and and see what the
[57:28] lord has to say
[57:32] i want reading the scriptures to be more
[57:34] important than plain xbox
[57:43] i want it to be more and more important
[57:45] of you maybe that has some jobs
[57:47] whatever your job is
[57:50] i want you to understand that this is
[58:05] do you know how many times
[58:09] the new testament references the old
[58:12] testament
[58:15] i mean those of you that have read the
[58:17] bible
[58:18] let me see how many of you have read the
[58:20] entire bible
[58:26] wow
[58:31] let me give
[58:47] they'll have read the quran how many
[58:49] times over and over and over
[58:53] how many christians do we have here
[58:57] and you've and and many of you have
[59:00] never read the bible
[59:15] i talked to brother caleb once yeah
[59:18] we're good friends we have a great
[59:20] relationship someone we went with
[59:21] he's never talked to me ever again
[59:25] wow you have a different definition of
[59:28] friendship
[59:38] i was going to challenge the young
[59:39] people now i got to challenge the older
[59:41] people
[59:43] and we wonder why with the holy spirit
[59:46] can't accomplish what it's
[59:48] what it wants to do in the service
[59:54] that in itself shows we're not prepared
[59:55] to receive it
[1:00:09] that god somehow just going to kenosis
[1:00:11] himself and just
[1:00:12] show himself because he shows himself by
[1:00:14] the scripture
[1:00:18] how could i this morning get you to
[1:00:20] understand how
[1:00:21] important it is
[1:00:25] you know i i find out even in
[1:00:29] of those that claim to be believers of
[1:00:31] malachi 4.
[1:00:34] and a lot of people that claim that
[1:00:35] don't even don't even hear the messages
[1:00:37] in any way
[1:00:39] but i noticed that many of them can tell
[1:00:41] you what brother branham said
[1:00:45] most of the time wrong the way we think
[1:00:49] we heard it
[1:00:52] for yourself but i'll tell you that many
[1:00:55] people
[1:00:56] they know the message but don't know the
[1:00:57] scripture to back it up
[1:01:02] so as long as you're talking to somebody
[1:01:03] in the mess oh brother says oh bro
[1:01:07] but you go out there
[1:01:23] sharpen your sharpen your swords
[1:01:27] so i'm going to make a challenge to the
[1:01:29] church here
[1:01:31] young people from now to the end of the
[1:01:33] year read the whole bible
[1:01:37] you'll have to read about seven to eight
[1:01:39] chapters a day
[1:01:42] to get to the whole bible sit down at
[1:01:46] nine at night
[1:01:48] and read the bible you're doing other
[1:01:50] things you can read it anytime i'm just
[1:01:52] saying that's when when when we get
[1:01:53] together as a group
[1:01:56] how many how many will do that we're
[1:01:58] christians right
[1:02:01] amen amen i don't want to be classified
[1:02:04] as a churchgoer
[1:02:09] that's right christian is one thing
[1:02:11] churchgoers another thing
[1:02:16] i got that out of the way
[1:02:23] do you know how many scriptures from the
[1:02:26] old testament are
[1:02:27] referenced in the new testament
[1:02:45] but one scholar estimates that 10
[1:02:48] percent of the new testament
[1:02:50] is the referencing of the old testament
[1:02:55] as i've read the bible before you pick
[1:02:58] it up different places
[1:03:01] but i was shocked to see how many there
[1:03:04] are
[1:03:06] another scholar counted 855 references
[1:03:10] in the new testament
[1:03:14] another scholar made the following
[1:03:16] counts
[1:03:18] 302 direct quotes
[1:03:23] 493 illusions
[1:03:27] it alluded to something alluded to it in
[1:03:29] other words
[1:03:31] and 138 possible illusions
[1:03:37] bringing a total of 933 references
[1:04:25] it is said that jesus quoted the old
[1:04:28] testament
[1:04:28] 78 times
[1:04:34] however that is only what is written
[1:04:38] because we know on this trip
[1:04:41] to emmaus
[1:04:44] he quoted all of them
[1:04:48] imagine him and he wasn't walking with
[1:04:52] him saying hold on
[1:05:05] and this is what jeremiah and this is
[1:05:07] what isaiah says
[1:05:09] he was the word watch this now this this
[1:05:12] is so
[1:05:12] tremendous to me as we as we lay this
[1:05:15] foundation
[1:05:18] every scripture spoke of him
[1:05:22] jesus being the image of the invisible
[1:05:26] god
[1:05:28] jehovah of the old jesus has now become
[1:05:32] jesus of the new year tell me how
[1:05:43] i'm going to say it again every one of
[1:05:45] these little points they mean something
[1:06:01] jesus very good thank you thank your
[1:06:03] friend there
[1:06:04] jehovah of the old is jesus of the new
[1:06:07] year
[1:06:08] and his whole life was the fulfillment
[1:06:11] of those scriptures
[1:06:15] he was the fulfillment of all that the
[1:06:18] prophets had
[1:06:18] spoken
[1:06:22] and all that jesus did
[1:06:25] and lived was for one purpose
[1:06:44] can you imagine this that our whole
[1:06:47] life would be for one purpose
[1:06:51] to fulfill scripture
[1:06:54] i'm not here to be a billionaire
[1:06:58] i'm not here for other things though if
[1:06:59] god adds whatever he has praise the lord
[1:07:04] a purpose in life
[1:07:10] is to fulfill scripture
[1:07:39] that's what his whole life was about and
[1:07:42] that's what the whole life of the bride
[1:07:44] of jesus christ
[1:07:45] is about it's not how much
[1:07:48] of the world we can be a part of
[1:07:52] this world we've got to work and we've
[1:07:54] got to do a lot of things
[1:07:57] but we are not of this world
[1:08:01] watch what he says he healed the people
[1:08:04] why so that it might be fulfilled
[1:08:08] what
[1:08:18] i want to ask you the question how many
[1:08:20] of you are aware of
[1:08:21] every prophecy or scripture
[1:08:37] i just want to cry out this morning
[1:08:40] get into god's word nothing better that
[1:08:44] you can invest your time into
[1:08:46] and now
[1:08:50] can you imagine us living that way one
[1:08:53] of the victorious people we would be
[1:08:56] victorious why did you do that
[1:09:03] the scriptures could be foreign
[1:09:30] i don't know about you but i'm feeling
[1:09:31] good this morning is
[1:09:45] this is why this series is so important
[1:09:47] to me and to you
[1:09:51] i want you to know the scriptures young
[1:09:53] people
[1:09:55] so that no one can deceive you
[1:09:59] want you to tell your neighbor
[1:10:29] you better have more than that our
[1:10:32] founding pastor would always say
[1:10:36] now don't just take my word for it
[1:10:40] go out and you study it for yourself
[1:10:44] you'll come back and know that i told
[1:10:46] you the truth
[1:10:49] now it cost you something to search it
[1:10:53] that way nobody gonna take it away
[1:11:01] i think many times that this new
[1:11:03] generation wants to live off of
[1:11:05] a second hand or third-hand generation
[1:11:10] regulations
[1:11:24] think about
[1:11:32] daniel 1 3 who's got daniel 1 3. stand
[1:11:34] up real quick
[1:11:37] and i want you to read that
[1:11:43] and the king spake speak unto ashbanez
[1:11:50] is that how you speak
[1:11:53] um the master of his enochs
[1:11:57] that that he should bring certain of the
[1:11:59] children of israel
[1:12:00] and of the king seed and to the prince
[1:12:03] princes
[1:12:05] who are these children that he told him
[1:12:07] to bring from jerusalem go ahead
[1:12:09] her sport trojan and who whom
[1:12:12] was no blemish oh my let's just stop
[1:12:15] there for a moment
[1:12:17] children whom there was no blemish
[1:12:20] that much
[1:12:37] about the elected lady and her children
[1:12:40] watch what this is talking about what
[1:12:43] else
[1:12:44] i'm skillful in all wisdom children that
[1:12:47] are skillful in all wisdom
[1:12:57] yeah understanding science right that we
[1:13:00] didn't come from
[1:13:01] from a monkey
[1:13:08] ability in them to stand in the king's
[1:13:10] palace wow
[1:13:11] and what else and whom they might teach
[1:13:15] the learning
[1:13:16] and the tongue of the child i wondered
[1:13:19] when i read this how many of our
[1:13:21] children and young people
[1:13:24] would have been chosen at that time
[1:13:29] would i have been chosen
[1:13:44] 20 when he found these children and they
[1:13:48] were brought to
[1:13:50] babylon what does it say
[1:13:54] and in all matters of wisdom and
[1:13:56] understanding that the king inquired of
[1:13:58] them
[1:13:59] he found them ten times better than all
[1:14:01] the magicians and astrologers that were
[1:14:03] in
[1:14:03] all in his world the knowledge of god is
[1:14:06] so much greater than the knowledge
[1:14:11] let me tell young people
[1:14:35] [Applause]
[1:14:40] oh you i don't know if you believe me or
[1:14:42] do you believe me
[1:14:44] yeah don't you ever let anybody tell you
[1:14:46] that you're lesser than them
[1:14:48] you would be like i don't think you know
[1:14:50] who my papa is
[1:14:54] daniel was between the ages of 12 and 14
[1:14:57] years old
[1:15:00] when he was taken into captivity
[1:15:03] 12 to 14 years old
[1:15:09] imagine at that age
[1:15:12] that you would be taken into captivity
[1:15:14] to another
[1:15:16] country living in another kingdom
[1:15:21] full of heathens and
[1:15:36] themselves as much pagans as they were
[1:15:41] but daniel pero daniel 12 and 14 years
[1:15:44] old
[1:15:46] he kept himself
[1:15:49] now this is important okay everything
[1:15:51] i'm telling you is leading up to
[1:15:53] something else
[1:15:56] instructions to daniel
[1:16:00] he was ousted from his people
[1:16:14] we went i don't know how much maybe nine
[1:16:16] months ten months whatever without
[1:16:17] coming to church
[1:16:25] here he is 70 years
[1:16:30] not a year no nano
[1:16:46] except what he's saying himself
[1:16:51] how many of you have a song to sing
[1:16:54] well nobody sings around you well
[1:16:56] there's nothing going on here
[1:16:58] there's no revival here really
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:07] [Applause]
[1:17:55] he held true to god
[1:18:09] oh he was never tempted oh yes he was a
[1:18:12] human
[1:18:14] he was under 12 to 14 year old young man
[1:18:18] but i'm going to tell you the way i see
[1:18:19] him what kept him local
[1:18:21] during his time because those
[1:18:38] i want somebody to tell me how without
[1:18:40] the holy ghost
[1:18:42] did he keep his testimony
[1:18:46] himself
[1:18:50] anybody can say
[1:19:01] and he read what the prophets
[1:19:05] before him had spoken
[1:19:35] of all the ages of the toilet
[1:19:38] identified in the scriptures
[1:19:42] i want to drive this home this morning
[1:19:45] but i gotta stay true to what i was
[1:19:47] called this morning to do and that
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:20:00] jeremiah was the prophet's prophet
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:12] as a young man he studied the prophets
[1:20:15] what the prophets had spoken
[1:20:42] i understood by books that jeremiah
[1:20:59] jeremiah's book
[1:21:02] and bring him to such a place
[1:21:05] that even israel coming out
[1:21:08] of them alive would go back to their
[1:21:12] homeland
[1:21:26] you know
[1:21:40] how can we spend wasteless time
[1:21:44] gambling holes
[1:21:47] and i didn't pick movies and phones oh
[1:21:49] that's me i'm sorry
[1:21:51] i'm sorry that that was that got put in
[1:21:53] there sometimes
[1:21:59] the pastor speaks on something and you
[1:22:01] would like to get up and get
[1:22:03] and go out
[1:22:07] too long and you're dissatisfied
[1:23:47] it's got a dovetail from matthew to
[1:23:48] revelation
[1:23:51] he never said that he said make sure it
[1:23:54] goes from
[1:23:54] genesis all the way to revelation
[1:23:58] why he was showing us all that the
[1:24:01] prophets had spoken
[1:24:04] oh my my my how many are with me this
[1:24:07] this morning
[1:24:08] we're getting into some good stuff here
[1:24:11] always remember i want you to remember
[1:24:14] this
[1:24:14] is
[1:24:48] [Applause]
[1:24:55] the record that shows
[1:25:10] i find out
[1:25:23] these are all scriptures you gotta know
[1:25:25] young people
[1:25:27] you've got to have a firm foundation
[1:25:32] surely the lord god
[1:25:36] the lord god everybody together surely
[1:25:39] who
[1:25:41] okay go ahead we'll do nothing some
[1:25:44] things
[1:25:48] go ahead
[1:25:52] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[1:25:55] servants the prophet
[1:25:56] oh and once god has spoken you know this
[1:25:59] because yours have lost he don't change
[1:26:01] the way he does things
[1:26:04] he does things
[1:26:08] and won't change them no matter the
[1:26:10] circumstances
[1:26:13] not for anyone no time
[1:26:18] he has a way of doing things
[1:26:47] that the prophets have spoken
[1:26:51] when god reveals something to his
[1:26:52] prophet
[1:26:55] the moment that the prophet speaks it
[1:26:57] the moment
[1:26:59] it automatically starts the wheel of
[1:27:02] prophecy moving
[1:27:04] momentum is stationary
[1:27:10] i remember the will in the middle of the
[1:27:11] wheel
[1:27:15] the will of prophecy
[1:27:44] what is the cog wheel show me up show
[1:27:47] them a picture you all know what this is
[1:27:51] oh my there's a big one
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:54] that's the great cog wheel of prophecy
[1:27:58] and every
[1:28:26] until god says
[1:28:40] another prophet
[1:28:53] everlasting father
[1:29:07] it's gonna draw in other little cog
[1:29:11] wheels
[1:29:15] are the ones the person or people
[1:29:20] that will fulfill the prophecies
[1:29:36] is
[1:29:46] he's a good mechanic the job of a gear
[1:29:48] is to do whatever
[1:29:52] exactly right it is to transfer power
[1:29:55] from one part of a machine to another
[1:29:57] espera
[1:30:01] i don't know if you got that or not i'm
[1:30:03] going to say it again the job
[1:30:17] is the driver gear that is
[1:30:32] the other gear turns counter clockwise
[1:30:39] i get flooded i'm sorry if the gear is
[1:30:42] going forward and stealing
[1:30:43] prophecy is going forward
[1:31:00] it's important to understand because the
[1:31:02] purpose of prophecy
[1:31:05] is not to isolate the big cog
[1:31:09] but it's to engage in the other cog
[1:31:12] wheels
[1:31:14] so that the power
[1:31:43] messages so brother branham says now
[1:31:45] this person is going to be healed but
[1:31:46] you say
[1:31:48] everything has to be in order here's the
[1:31:51] prophet now
[1:31:52] but i can't put the hat there this is
[1:31:56] where i can
[1:32:22] he may do it and not even be aware that
[1:32:24] he just did that
[1:32:27] he may be drinking a cup of coffee
[1:32:33] and all of a sudden the vision is ready
[1:32:36] to be fulfilled
[1:32:47] everything has got to be in this order
[1:32:57] but the prophet can't do that himself
[1:33:00] he brings the prophecy i don't know
[1:33:03] about you
[1:33:05] [Applause]
[1:33:06] that just included me in you this woman
[1:33:10] i'm going to say it again that just
[1:33:12] included me and you this is
[1:33:15] okay now let's go on
[1:33:18] israel israel
[1:33:43] brother branham says in israel and the
[1:33:45] church
[1:33:46] the hour of the cogs
[1:33:51] of god's prophetic wills prophetica
[1:33:55] has ground up to this timeline
[1:33:59] time for this deliverer to come on the
[1:34:02] scene
[1:34:08] to abraham abraham that the children of
[1:34:10] israel would be in bondage for 400 years
[1:34:15] it's already prophesied
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:58] [Music]
[1:35:09] oh we're too busy sometimes it's time to
[1:35:12] get our attention
[1:35:26] that fits perfectly
[1:35:40] but sure
[1:35:43] i'm going to say it again goggs god's
[1:35:45] cog wheel of
[1:35:46] prophecy
[1:35:53] why does it grind slow because his will
[1:35:56] was that nobody no one would perish
[1:36:00] he gives us every opportunity with him
[1:36:05] his long suffering keeps it from going
[1:36:07] too fast
[1:36:33] you want to see something tremendous i'm
[1:36:35] going to turn those lights off
[1:36:37] sister can you just reach over there and
[1:36:38] just
[1:36:44] this is god's perfect night
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:36:59] [Music]
[1:37:04] sometimes we think lord have you
[1:37:06] abandoned me

[1:39:19] to where god wants it
[1:39:38] notice the way that brother branham puts
[1:39:40] this
[1:39:42] because we think we're just going to be
[1:39:43] standing here and all of a sudden
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:47] he's going to it'll catch on to us
[1:39:51] how many have you ever seen a
[1:40:20] something
[1:41:17] do you understand how important this is
[1:41:20] watch this now something's got to happen
[1:41:24] the little will is turned by faith
[1:41:28] the big will by the power of god
[1:41:58] yeah who's been asking god for something
[1:42:02] this morning come on let me see your
[1:42:03] hands
[1:42:05] i don't care what it is waiting for the
[1:42:08] faith
[1:42:11] through the beat of the cogwheel of
[1:42:13] prophecy
[1:42:17] now notice this now he says it'll make
[1:42:20] light
[1:42:22] loose that's moving
[1:42:40] together
[1:42:55] okay so you know what i'm talking about
[1:42:57] i give you examples
[1:43:00] here's martha a question concerning her
[1:43:02] brother
[1:43:04] god a place of worship
[1:43:22] i believe my
[1:43:34] because god is vindicating his word in
[1:43:36] your
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:52] that he was the messiah no doubt about
[1:43:55] it
[1:43:56] i believe that you are that christ that
[1:43:58] was to come
[1:44:01] because your works testify that god has
[1:44:04] sent you
[1:44:53] you're exactly watch this now watch this
[1:44:56] now think it's an instagram this is why
[1:44:57] it's so important church to know the
[1:44:59] scriptures
[1:45:00] is i believe that you're exactly
[1:45:05] what you're identified in the scriptures
[1:45:11] and i believe that this is the day
[1:45:27] i want you to tell that to whatever
[1:45:29] you're asking for
[1:45:31] i believe lord that you are here come on
[1:45:35] i believe lord that you are here
[1:45:39] you've been identified by scriptures
[1:45:44] and i believe that this is the day that
[1:45:46] messiah should come
[1:45:49] and i have been looking for it
[1:45:53] what did it produce brother brown says
[1:45:57] it produced
[1:45:58] the resurrection of her brother
[1:46:02] tell me we have nothing to do with the
[1:46:03] resurrection
[1:46:07] of prophecy
[1:46:10] for those
[1:46:19] let me be one of those teeth let me be
[1:46:22] one of those teeth
[1:46:52] it doesn't fit every other cog quilt
[1:46:57] but brother it seems like it's like it's
[1:47:00] going so fast
[1:47:04] if you had a cog wheel with ten teeth on
[1:47:20] absolutely
[1:47:34] i haven't done some there's some things
[1:47:36] i have maybe didn't do that's very good
[1:47:41] did you know that we'll solve what we
[1:47:43] read
[1:47:44] i'm sorry we'll reap what we saw
[1:47:47] whether good or bad and that's why many
[1:47:50] times when we see
[1:47:51] when we do something wrong
[1:47:55] we we may see well nothing happened to
[1:47:56] me
[1:47:59] we think we got away with it
[1:48:46] just remember that why when we go out
[1:48:50] and live any kind of life
[1:48:54] i think that because something doesn't
[1:48:56] happen to us right away that we got away
[1:49:40] me
[1:49:56] and and then brother tim matthew 24 11
[1:50:00] and then this mr sarah
[1:50:04] matthew 7 15 and 16
[1:50:08] and then brother abe
[1:50:11] uh deuteronomy 18
[1:50:15] uh 18 20 and 20. go ahead
[1:50:19] forever o lord thy word is settled in
[1:50:22] heaven
[1:50:24] heaven doesn't argue about when god says
[1:50:27] something
[1:50:30] it's already settled we argue about it
[1:50:35] but in glory it's settled already like
[1:50:37] gloria can say amen to that
[1:50:40] already settled yes okay matthew 24 11.
[1:50:43] now we want to know now i'm going to i'm
[1:50:46] going to read these scriptures and then
[1:50:47] i'm going to close already
[1:50:50] i want to stop here this is my
[1:50:51] foundation for these messages
[1:50:54] matthew 24 11. do we know
[1:50:58] then
[1:51:01] if god will do nothing but he reveals
[1:51:05] his
[1:51:06] secret unto his servants the prophet
[1:51:09] how do we know then if that's a real
[1:51:12] prophet or not
[1:51:14] because you all are going to understand
[1:51:15] and hear that
[1:51:17] many false prophets will arise and
[1:51:20] you've got to be able to know which one
[1:51:21] is the true prophet and which one is not
[1:51:26] 24. and many false prophets
[1:51:30] shall rise and deceive many oh my let's
[1:51:33] not be part of that many
[1:51:34] no how do these false prophets deceive
[1:51:38] the people
[1:51:41] these scriptures down matthew 7 we got
[1:51:44] i'm showing you by
[1:51:47] 7 scripture and 16. go ahead sister
[1:51:50] beware of false prophets which come to
[1:51:53] you in sheep
[1:51:54] oh that's how way to ho ho ho ho
[1:51:59] beware of false prophets that how did
[1:52:01] they come
[1:52:05] beware false prophets which come to you
[1:52:08] in sheep's
[1:52:09] clothing oh but really inside or what
[1:52:12] keep on reading
[1:52:13] but inwardly they are rave
[1:52:17] ravening gloves so how will you know
[1:52:20] them
[1:52:23] you shall know them by their fruits
[1:52:27] deuteronomy 18 now let's go back to see
[1:52:30] the old testament
[1:52:33] deuteronomy 18 20 and 20-22
[1:52:42] but the prophet which shall presume
[1:52:45] to speak a word in my name which i have
[1:52:49] not commanded
[1:52:50] him to speak or thou or that
[1:52:54] shall speak in the name of other gods
[1:52:57] even that prophet shall die
[1:53:01] and if thou say in thine heart how
[1:53:04] shall we know the word
[1:53:08] which the lord hath not spoken how are
[1:53:10] you going to know the word that god
[1:53:11] hasn't spoken
[1:53:19] anyone that even claims to be a prophet
[1:53:22] use the scripture oh they'll use
[1:53:24] scripture let me tell you
[1:53:26] but it doesn't coincide from genesis to
[1:53:28] revelation
[1:53:33] when a prophet speaketh in the name of
[1:53:35] the lord if the thing
[1:53:37] follow not nor come to pass that is the
[1:53:39] thing which the lord
[1:53:41] he has not spoken hold on right there
[1:53:43] that's how you know
[1:53:44] i see what a prophet says comes to pass
[1:53:46] believe him
[1:53:49] if it doesn't say no don't believe him
[1:53:53] because if he speaks of him by himself
[1:53:56] what's going to happen
[1:53:59] one reading but the prophet has not but
[1:54:02] the prophet
[1:54:03] has spoken presumptually that
[1:54:07] means simply with arrogance and pride
[1:54:13] thou shalt see thou shalt not be afraid
[1:54:16] of him
[1:54:17] okay that's simple if somebody comes to
[1:54:20] tell you and it's
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:31] i'm going to tell you that this is where
[1:54:33] we're going where we're going and i'm

[1:54:41] to put this out as long as the lord
[1:54:43] gives us this we'll keep on going with
[1:54:45] this
[1:54:47] but we want to get somewhere
[1:55:01] this is where we're going now listen
[1:55:02] closely now this is where we're going
[1:55:05] okay
[1:55:06] we're going to go through the whole the
[1:55:07] life of jesus
[1:55:09] can show all that the prophet spoke
[1:55:13] the old testament how many know that
[1:55:15] jesus was the complete fulfillment of
[1:55:18] all the old testament
[1:55:22] who's the fulfillment of the new
[1:55:23] testament
[1:55:25] that's where we're going oh yeah watch

[2:32:46] he was my friend me he was our friend
[2:32:50] they didn't much
[2:32:51] and he was our fellow labor you don't go
[2:32:53] through
[2:32:55] i die
[2:33:05] i told my wife if i die bury me
[2:33:15] i wrote this last night yesterday
[2:33:20] and the reason i wrote wrote this is uh
[2:33:24] of what we saw in the land of karamojo
[2:33:29] where where brother jokes is from you
[2:33:32] it's where they put all the quote
[2:33:34] unquote rejects of the country
[2:33:39] the criminals the murders
[2:33:42] etc etc but from the moment we met
[2:33:47] brother yolks
[2:33:50] everyone on our team the most
[2:33:52] interesting people wanted to go to
[2:33:54] karamoja
[2:33:58] before we went up to karamoja until
[2:34:18] and in that saturday there was about 10
[2:34:21] 000 people
[2:34:24] personas and there was kings from
[2:34:26] nigeria
[2:34:28] or from ghana
[2:34:42] and dignitaries the president of the
[2:34:45] country
[2:34:49] well this was a royal event
[2:34:54] but i want to take you to a land called
[2:36:05] and every negative adjective that was
[2:36:08] given
[2:36:11] we encountered quite the opposite
[2:36:16] you ever hear the scripture that says
[2:36:18] having nothing yet possessing all right
[2:36:33] we will never forget the reception that
[2:36:36] was given
[2:36:40] they were jumping they were shouting
[2:36:47] and the lord had me write
[2:37:15] and every positive adjective we can
[2:37:17] afford it
[2:37:20] and what miracles god did
[2:37:27] so wonderful
[2:37:30] wonderful to see and to here
[2:37:34] they are now written in our hearts by
[2:37:36] god's own hand
[2:37:41] these men have suffered because of the
[2:37:43] gospel's sake
[2:37:58] when he was captured
[2:38:10] drove in a motorcycle for hours
[2:38:18] i feel like a lightweight just coming
[2:38:20] from silver in a tacoma
[2:38:27] for hours in a motorcycle
[2:38:30] dirt road whatever it may be
[2:38:35] to go and preach the gospel
[2:38:39] a cog
[2:38:55] he told me the story the testimony of
[2:38:58] when he went to a sister's house
[2:39:05] this family had been going with days
[2:39:07] without eating
[2:39:16] and we sent it to the hands of brother
[2:39:19] brother yolks
[2:39:22] and brother yokes gets to the sister's
[2:39:25] house at midnight
[2:39:28] she went to sleep thinking she would not
[2:39:32] see the morning
[2:39:36] but at midnight he went and goes and
[2:39:38] wakes her up
[2:39:43] that's how much he loves people
[2:39:48] to give her food to give her family food
[2:39:53] what a life what a heart
[2:39:57] these are people that you that you look
[2:39:59] for
[2:40:00] it way back in history
[2:40:04] these are people in our time
[2:40:08] what a heart what a life
[2:40:11] it doesn't always come through rightly
[2:40:13] foreign words brother branham says
[2:40:18] it
[2:40:46] but in that land there's no covet
[2:40:50] there's no pain there's no sorrow
[2:40:53] all right no tears only perfect
[2:40:59] and i want to leave you with a quote
[2:41:01] that i heard our pastor say at sister
[2:41:03] bernice's funerals
[2:41:10] and i wanted to run through the whole
[2:41:11] cemetery
[2:41:14] and he says that many people will say
[2:41:16] certain thing caused
[2:41:18] and took that certain person away
[2:41:26] but let everybody know that kova did not
[2:41:28] take brother yokes away
[2:41:32] for god took him the day he gave his
[2:41:35] life to him
[2:41:39] brother the oaks didn't die last week
