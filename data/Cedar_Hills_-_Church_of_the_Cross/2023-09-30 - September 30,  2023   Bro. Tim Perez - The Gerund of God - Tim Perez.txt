I'd rather be out of the line I love the Lord and I know you love him so I got an enemy and my enemy is timepo all right and the problem is your problem is is that I grew up around Apostles and every one of them corrected all right so if I get into telling stories this is God's will this is let's go with it it's all about our heads and let's go to the author and finish over our face heavenly father father Celestial the hours and I Lord Jesus I've heard your thoughts and you know my heart and I know your thoughts and I Surrender my beings this is your time I want no glory I want no honor I

always been filled around quote coaches yes and so I learned at a very young age that I had to train okay so so we have to be trained right okay so we're going to go into there I'm here to help you that most of the people don't know you've got something that most people out there billions of people in this Earth so with with that let's go to my my I gave you my title and we're gonna read it together okay we're in only in English we read it together brother Henry is my voice he'll just he'll just read in Spanish but nobody nobody will read that just him okay everybody have it if you don't we got the screen okay on the count of three one two three it is the spirit who quickens the flesh provided no benefit the word that I have spoken to you are spirit and our life is yes thank you so the word is bringing to life okay so the spirit of God is bringing to life the words that are right here it is spirit and it's life and those two things John chapter 1 verse 12. okay one two three as many as received him to those who believed in his name gave them power to become sons of God Amen okay you're awfully weak off the week okay act like we're on the fields we're playing ball we're having a good time casa this is your house okay this is your house it's the sukasa all right I'm not asking you to be quiet I'm asking your voice I'm asking you to confess I'm asking you to confess okay because they that received him and Believe on him he gave them you you you you that is you our studies to become the Sons and Daughters of God I don't care what you think right okay because I gotta talk to myself okay I don't care what my myself says no no you're not a son of God I'm defeated I've got to listen to the word of God the word of God I am where are you okay I are you with me okay let's see if you're with me Jeremiah 15 16 yes he says all right is it up there okay thy words I oh hold on sorry I got a problem I want to go 100 miles an hour at my age because his body don't do what I wanted to do it okay I'm sorry brother I'm sorry I'm going the opposite way I should be going to his way all right here we go thy words were found and I it did eat them and Thy Word was unto me joy and rejoicing what are you called by what are you called by what are you called by okay all right what did you find what did you find what did you find I found the word I found the words okay all right you with me okay now that I got your attention it says that I am called by thy name the Lord God of hosts okay and when you see God of hosts he's talking about an army and you are the Army all right you're the Army I haven't even started the guy oh my goodness here we go let's go let's go with that Luke chapter 24 verse 45 Lucas 24 45 of Luke because slide number five gotta get going all right you ready you with me can you put up slide number five please I gotta be nice okay Luke chapter 24 45 I'll just read it he then he opened their minds read it with me okay then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures okay so so when he opens the minds he's opening the mind that are in the heart okay he's opening the mind that's in the heart okay the mind is in the heart is and in the house there's many spaces and one of those spaces you know this was the spot you call a bedroom is that right and you call it a kitchen laundry the living room they're all spaces okay God did the same thing in your heart and in that space foreign okay so so the the purpose of the spirit of the Lord is to Quicken the words into your heart okay am I speaking Chinese amen if you even if you don't believe it is it the word of God am I preaching another message I'm not here to bring anything new here to repeat something that you've already been resonate within you God's listening to you okay I am so sorry I got the opposite okay so everybody's still with me this is the reason why why number six the Apostle Paul he prays and he says the eyes of your heart be enlightened that you may understand okay so the only way that you're going to get the words taking place all right you're with me you're with me are you with me you you are weak this is okay I'm not talking about the youth hey I'm your coach right now raise your hands if you ever had a coach ever had them be in your face they ever get your helmet um yeah I messed up yeah did I did did I get a fit minnow hey oh that's supposed to put me in the game again let me make up for the mistake I made it okay so I mean why do you get why do you get hurt correction is a tools you know my pastor told me he says people don't like to come around he says and I can see into their life and I can discern their life and I can see what's wrong that's why I'm here Uncle foreign [Applause] that should be your attitude foreign and with the other hand holding on before yeah organized Amber did it hurt Amber was the type of girl that she she wouldn't say so because she didn't say she got more uh okay but when you get with it all right okay you're with me now it's not comigo okay so what I what I want to do Sunny where are you I I need a volunteer I need a 12th grader I need a senior in high school a junior in high school junior a freshman in high school sophomore freshman and in eighth grade all the way down to kindergarten I just need one if you're if you're a senior come over here on that side okay and while they're doing that okay I've got the principal here and while he's doing that I want you to understand go back to slide five okay go back to side five all right and you all pay attention over here okay Slide Five it says then they open their understanding of their minds so they could understand the scriptures okay so so how does the Lord open Luke 24 45. what it does is it brings the former and latter ring together at the same time at the same time the former and Ladder race John 6 63 is our words and life okay and he's bringing them together all right amen you're still with me right and he brings those two Reigns the former line arrange and it brings together as one but it's a double portion it's a double portion of the word and the message together and the myth and the bride receives hey she receives a double blessing are you with me and she receives this blessings through the ministry of prophets and apostles which is the foundation that Luke Chapter 2 Verse 18 and 20 spoke up the Lucas eight to eighteen yeah and from this Foundation comes the fivefold Ministries those no okay you have been taught correctly all right yeah okay that's fine we'll go with what we have okay so so then when it's wired correctly when when you're when it's wired correctly is is and and when you go when you get up in the night and you go to the switch light switch you're not afraid you're not questioning there's no doubt why do that you go up right up there and you hit there right and you expect light you stay spirit and that's the same thing with God's words foreign all right are you with me okay I I don't have much time to spend on that but I'll leave it right there so but great are you a senior congratulations you're at the end okay no senior ditch day freshman eighth grade six six oh great brother Levi second MJ first and kinder okay what do they all have in common yeah they're all they're all going to school okay they're all going to school is that right they're all enrolled in in the Educational Systems okay you got to say Amen all right thank you that now that's better I'm not asking harder questions [Music] okay all right so they are all in common that they're in the public schools who's eighth grade eighth grade I learned algebra between your freshman between these two graders I learned algebra okay my son when he went to school you started learning algebra in third grade okay we have teachers here at what age do you teach the mathematics look look let me help you okay I ate mathematic in third grade I found mathematic in third grade okay now they're teaching them they're finding they're finding they're finding mathematics they're finding multiplications multiplication I'm sorry I gotta go back because I'm I'm trying to go too fast multiplications is part of what grade teachers okay dilemma they're they're being taught okay they're being taught they're being taught to use this you'll hear me they're not being taught okay all right Satan chose this is [Applause] how many hours of school do you spend a day eight what time do you get up let's say it's Monday morning what time do you get up 7 30. 8 45 what time do you get out of school huh 3 45. are the teachers so nice that they don't send you home with homework so you're actually not done more or less how many hours do you spend on homework okay you do the math this is estoys it's the way of civilization okay this is the way of civilization and civilization civilization removes the supernatural out of our Lives okay okay you see all right all right this is the way civilization okay and civilization removes the spiritual the supernatural out of our lives and if you're going to see God the only way you see is the Supernatural is okay you've got to be seeing him all right and then in in the days of of Israel when they left Egypt they saw the supernatural every single day and I'm here to tell you you've got to be seen the supernatural thank you okay so man it was not created to think all right he was created all right so I asked you parents who's teaching them jealous shame on you expect us you have to be training them jealous that's not our job but we spend so much time putting out fires okay fires incendios your house is on fire okay you follow what I'm saying you hear me all right I haven't got your attention all right the problem is we're thinking too much with this instead of not thinking with it the problem is okay and the greatest battles wants to do something and this one down here doesn't want to do it there's the battle foreign shalom do you know why there's a battle there's no Mutual consent um this guy here going one way yesterday and the other guy how many of you have over 20 years wow that's a lot how did how did we become so critical um look I've been born and raised in the church I remember my cousin way back the preacher from eight years old we grow up in the church we know you can say whatever you want to say but we see it but why is it and the longer you stay in church the more critical and judgmental you must critical is and and it's it's so it's so contagious it's a virus that is stronger than covet because let me tell you something brother Baron says that the Nations will be producing a germ bomb okay that will kill [Music] I have seen death in the face I've seen death in the face it is come finger here get out of my way yeah you've gotta work together you got no business worrying about any viruses you got something so strong you've been inoculated all right and she wanted coven so that she could know how to treat her patients and I can't touch them there's the reason why I Don't Preach because I don't like to be on YouTube and if you preach the message in the fullness the way it is too many weak Focus this is okay are you tired all right are you enjoying this is let's give God a cash problems [Applause] okay so there's the battle right that there's a battle going on you got a person up here you got a battle going on okay you have two people driving your ship coming up which one drives the ship is the one that got his hand on the rudder okay the captain of the ship he sits out and he can see the Seas right and he's the captain and and he says turn it to the left and Israeli and the guy down at the bottom so he can move the rudder so the boat can go to the left and I'll let you Ellie it's not the captain that's running that's driving the boat it's the guy at the runners Iglesia in the church in Iglesia that believe the message okay one group um and there's another group that believes and this is a fuss that's going on in the church and I'm telling you the ones the ones that'll receive the messages okay you're messing it up in your mouth why do you got a cigarette in your mouth and right away what does the Bible says it's okay just keep on the face okay is to fall in love with you oh Jesus if you know my friend I want to introduce you to me that friend is Amigo he's going to help you in everything and he's going to help you overcome all you have to do is all in love Jesus all right you got it okay so the person at the Mind la persona he says I believe it pastor pastor and he does and he's here helping yes okay at least you're helping and he's he's putting sweat and labor okay he's there help him you love this yeah he says I believe this is but unless the person that's down here then that person is a Persona is not going to receive they're healing or their request all right and when you doubt yourself the Holy Spirit takes place where I'm going right okay but when you have a mutual consent between the minds and the mind then faith is activated and then your word become materialized did you hear what I said the Bible says and they will be given unto you you have to eat with faith and it will materialize I'm here to tell you that when you turn on the switch it's gonna run brutal body and it's going to cause a resurrection no meeting of the minds no meanings of the mind no no meanings of the mind yeah meaning or um produces Wars produce okay and US parents where we're too focused on other things we don't realize our son and daughter are struggling you you family members of The Familiar of the household of God we've got we got people here we have we have young people and adults who love the Lord but they can't overcome and you're you're criticizing them your judgment you're judging them you're not helping them they've got a world going on and they know they've got a war going on there's got to be some compassion there's gotta there's gotta be there's got to be someone to put your hands I was there once I was there once I heard my uncles preach the words oh Jesus I wanted to live it with all my heart and then I had people criticizing me nobody criticized me out there Aki it became a hostile environment here still oh Jesus we've got to help them they got to learn how to how to how to think with the heart when I saw my son I said oh Jesus Lord help me and I went over to my son and I told my son I said you're going to be disobedient that's okay you see what I'm saying the person who controls the mind of the heart you know who that person is selfie come on guys Chelsea it's a selfie oh take it like this and the sisters well I'm very happy all right because you're off be quiet and I'm talking your language I'm talking the language okay I'm here to help you okay the problem is the wonderful here is controlling okay and you know the nature of selfie in the heart is okay and I'm here to tell you you got a pig nature it's okay it's okay I'm here to help you I'm here to put my hand around you said you know why because if you hang around long enough with me because you walk with me I can give it to you is going to change I know what I'm talking about I came to Bernie's house with a pig nature I want the baptism of the Holy ghosts and and he and I said yes sir okay and he stops did you understand me this see he says the Bible's in the restroom you go with me I'm sorry but I grew up with the apostles sorry okay and if I tell you more stories we'll never finish okay you got to be careful with me because I'm a long-winded person are you okay what's the problem with the pig nature you've all been in church long enough you should know this is you know what the problem is with pig nature it wants a sensation it wants the sensation and one of the hardest things the message brother Banner please again he spoke against the doctrine of sensationalism and the problem is in the message because it's filled with Sensations there's too many of you expecting the ministers so that you can be healed that is not the message what many of you want the anointing oil to be put on you which is positioned I was positioned as an elder of the church at age 30 years old okay I anoint with oil anointed okay but the right way the fullness of the message [Applause] that's all you need that's all you need if the coach says get in the game if you never touched you you never know and what did you do okay don't tell me twice I'm here right and those giants yes okay those are giants over 100 pounds bigger than I am leave it as much as yo and at least a foot and a half taller than that yeah and you know what my coach said the bigger they are Harder They Fall kind I'm sorry I'm sorry because I went after them they brought them down I brought those giants down sometimes it was just me and the goal line behind me and then I run in the wall you know what the coach told me foreign because they are supposed to be dead a selfie we should open up a more business a morgue a more business a funeral home yeah we gotta bury some people eagle [Applause] okay that big nature is supposed to be deadly supposed to be dead all right it's supposed to be dead okay what happened que pasa Pastor stands up here I love you brother Jerry if I use an example I appreciate you coming to my house helping me out picking me up my car was stranded I really appreciate it yeah yeah the brother over here yeah I've been in this house all week I've been putting floor in his house I've been at his house big nature selfie alert alert a selfie we have become Masters okay sisters you're going to take over the potluck um it's like eating cake I'll help you right now all right don't forget I know where I'm at the story Negroes and and what does the sister say who eats with black people [Applause] are the pinto beans what counts is the pinto beans yeah you gotta say Amen sisters [Music] who cares you should have been with me on the missionaries when I was with my Dad we visit people they told me you eat what they put in here you eat whatever they give you little did I know that brother brother Anaya was going and Hawking his furniture so he could feed us at the table and there's a big Oya of seafood got eyes in it you look it's [Applause] mom serve me just give me give me man I hate everything one morning I got up okay between me and you I got it walk in the kitchen and wait a minute how many of you cook eggs you cook eggs you leave the pan with oil on yourself how many do that oh now I don't get no volunteers fat you live bye I got up in the morning walked in the kitchen they're roaches and the sister's making the huevos well you can understand what's going on my mind I'll take one roach I mean one egg you know what I did young people I hate it I hate it because that's the way it was taught because too many muchas is we need to take away the food from your house and you need to skip some milk okay the food you don't like okay I'm just getting started you got some time hey you know what who went to the carnival okay don't raise your hand now I know why my uncle always say please I'm gonna ask a question but don't answer them when you went to the carnival were you looking at the time foreign they're like yeah right we come to church everybody's gonna watch you know where I pray I don't have a watch okay you know why because they're interested in the Supernatural [Applause] all right all right so so I all those two those two examples of the men and women sisters you have become Masters you have become Masters okay you have become of the Resurrection you're resurrecting the wrong things irresurrecting the wrong thing it's better open your mouth okay thank you Lord I never expected my Uncle Bernie to single me out in the church and I work day and night and I worked and at times it was just me and him yeah he would tell a story and you know that story about all the animals of the Jungle and they had a big old party and there was dishes all over the place so all the animals got up together and and the and the lion the king yeah and it doesn't look right well it came down to the last two that it came down to the two ugliest of the species okay the chimpanzee in the monkey yeah and they look at each other and it says joseco have an Uncle Bernie he's coming into the church you I got the program the good programmer so-and-so is not here so and so is not here and the guy's supposed to preach he's not here and he ain't coming you know vienne and he didn't give us a notice you Joseph you know what I told him I want you to rest I know the burden he cares I know the sleepless nights I lived in his home for eight years she grew me in the ministry I'm a product of this ministry I'm nobody I'll take care of it okay we've become masters of the Resurrection okay we become masters of the resurrection of the wrong thing and as long look as as long as selfie is dead it can be resurrected are you listening to me okay as long as selfie is dead all right but when selfie is dead and he's rotted yeah he's rotted away selfie is gone where is it it's not there he's not there selfie died a long time and he brought it away okay selfie selfie I'm not done I'm just giving you no no tell me now so that's not ever be invited again thank you thank you thank you those of you that know me I used to bring thousands I used to draw a thousands to the stadiums and you gave me the ball and I would make them rowdy foreign foreign all right look at look at slide number one two great truths notice who is dying for me past tense Christ died for me that's finished it's done okay it's done it's something that's already done for you on your behalf it's done okay all you have to do is okay now notice notice you on the other side it says I must die with him daily [Music] the body Iglesia you gotta stop keeping your feelings on your skin you ever hung around my uncle Tommy uh you better have your jacket I love them he told me some things like oh uncle that's the way we grew up sons of the pastors sometimes you would get brother Bernie not you know brothers and then they would go home yeah the members of the house yeah we took we took it I said you know what I'm here to help you I'm here to help you and and uh just tell me and I'll I'll take care of it so it doesn't put you in a position that's bad I don't know if you understand okay but let me tell you something selfie has has to be crucified on the cross itself and he has to die and run again until he brought yesterday the Holy Spirit can't come in all right you with me all right and so so I'm wondering if I should give an example Give an example do you have time all right the parents tells the child go throw the trash honey foreign amen amen amen can't hear you okay the office of authority told you to throw the trash the office of the authority told you to lean the kitchen officials okay we're talking about the Battle of the mind right what is the child going to do huh it depends on who's running the ship dependent they can't accept it depends it depends on who he listens and yields his body too it depends on what's planted in the bottom of his heart depends and if that child is strong wheeled uh strong will strong-will you're going to have problems if you've got a docile child that's that's a pleasure it's probably gonna pay you more than the other one you hear me because the Bible says as as the child think is in his heart okay so the majority of

apostle I said apostle you may be seriously what did the messenger call you what does the bible call you yeah okay the Bible apologies the messages okay I I didn't say it generally yeah I just said he said it now you can okay there's two people in the church you can believe it or not apostolis nobody needs to and I'm not here to prove anything it is there's got to be people here that believe that they're Apostles you're the Apostle of your home you've got a job to put your house in orderly child Disobedience with the child or without the child Hallelujah if my son obeys me or if he doesn't see me over there say oh no I'm an apostle the Apostle are you still apostle get trash and he throws it away and he says hallelujah thank you Jesus shalom [Applause] you know what seven I know you don't

you've got to be the master of your circumstances circumstances do you know what that means I live with a doctor I fell in love with the doctor doctors are God's agents okay I'm not being critical doctors so do you know that God didn't make you to be doctored he didn't make you to be doctored doctor you have put way too much confidence and brother Bannon said that the systems of the world and the doctors have been trained a certain way they have been trained the way of the Pharmaceuticals the system okay of synthetic drugs have you ever heard Brothers synthetic drugs it's going to produce a side effects sometimes worse than the ailment is trying to which is and you're being left off in a worse estate than you were before so God gave me God gave me the birthright of my healing I don't need no synthetic drugs are you listening to me there's a way he gave it to me I don't have time to talk about it but if you have faith in your doctors I don't have faith I have faith in shalom [Music] [Applause] are you listening to me that soda pop you're drinking is I challenge you I I challenge any one of you no no you drank more soda than I did my dad worked for the Pepsi company and in a little town we grew up in there they bottled Sodapop that's where they bought it yeah and and and and the ones that were the reject instead of throwing them away because in that in those days it was it was it was told that that soda with sugar okay was another form of energy and so that the parents bought into it well I drank soda after tomorrow they're in the back of water I drank so many sodas fill all my teeth will run I have another nickname you know what they used to call me molacho you hear me I say all of that you know why because the Bible says that the two Spirits would be so close together the pale horse rider the world is following him okay and he's corrupted the food industry so now you grab a soda pop that's the worst thing you could put in your body is because what I drank was real sugar but you're drinking is a synthetic drug is and it's poison yes it's poison it's banana okay some of you have depression depression some some of you are going to do Studies have
