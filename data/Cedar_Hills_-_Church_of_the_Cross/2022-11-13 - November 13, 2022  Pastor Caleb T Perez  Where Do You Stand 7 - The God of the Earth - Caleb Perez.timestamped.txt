[53:42] water
[53:43] 20 worth 20 till alrighty Genesis the
[53:47] first chapter and he says and we will be
[53:51] we will be um
[53:55] put a subtitle to this and I don't know
[53:57] if I'm going to get to it or not because
[53:59] there's a lot here
[54:03] where do you stand number seven
[54:07] the god of the earth
[54:10] and so we'll see how far we go if not
[54:13] I'll pick it up when I next time I come
[54:15] back and we'll finish this off
[54:20] but our Focus today is on responsibility
[54:27] Genesis 1 28 says and God bless them and
[54:30] and God said unto them be fruitful
[54:33] and multiply and replenish the Earth and
[54:36] subdue it
[54:37] and have dominion over the fish of the
[54:40] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[54:41] over every living thing that moveth upon
[54:44] the Earth is
[54:56] what a tremendous thing we find here
[54:59] this is responsibility is
[55:03] responsibility you know sometimes we
[55:05] want to have titles
[55:08] sometimes we want to be this or that you
[55:12] want to be noticed we want this but when
[55:15] it's all said and done
[55:17] he was to have dominion over the fish of
[55:21] the sea
[55:22] over the style of the air
[55:25] every living thing that moveth upon the
[55:28] Earth
[55:31] what a responsibility was laid on his
[55:34] shoulders
[55:37] His blessings to the reading of his word
[55:39] you may be seated
[55:44] we have a responsibility
[55:48] that has been laid on our laps
[55:54] especially for Africa especially
[55:57] and uh
[55:59] I want to show you something this is
[56:03] Africa is just part of our
[56:05] responsibility so that's not all our
[56:07] responsibility Africa as parties
[56:10] but I wanna I wanna show you something
[56:15] um that as we were in in the old city of
[56:18] Jerusalem
[56:21] you know there are times that the Lord
[56:23] shows us things
[56:26] and uh and it really blessed my heart
[56:31] we were walking down the the uh we were
[56:34] walking down the the Via Dolorosa
[56:37] estamos
[56:39] everybody knows what that is right see
[56:42] your hands if you know remember
[56:45] the way of suffering
[56:48] it's the way where he carried the cross
[56:51] to going going to Calvary
[56:56] and going down that road uh
[57:00] there was a place that we saw a sign
[57:03] here and it said the pool of Bethesda um
[57:08] and as we entered into this place
[57:12] we came across this this picture that
[57:16] was hanging at the entrance
[57:21] I don't believe did you get that picture
[57:23] gentlemen
[57:26] a photo
[57:28] yes
[57:30] and uh we came across this picture you
[57:34] uh
[57:35] that was hanging and the entrance to
[57:37] that pool
[57:40] and as I looked at it and it says
[57:47] serving the church in 21 African
[57:50] countries
[57:54] I looked at that and I was like
[57:57] wow Lord I I I feel you talking to to me
[58:03] I'm aware that the Perez blancs is a
[58:07] Roman Catholic society
[58:11] that does missionary work in Africa
[58:15] but it stood out to me
[58:18] because it was not just a plaque of
[58:21] their work
[58:24] but it was a picture of our
[58:27] responsibility
[58:30] and I don't know you maybe can't see it
[58:33] but but two of the countries is is
[58:36] Uganda and and Ghana those little spaces
[58:39] is Uganda igana the Holy Spirit began to
[58:42] move there as I looked at it
[58:45] and I saw
[58:47] our responsibility
[58:50] as a family as a church
[58:54] posted on the walls of Old Jerusalem
[58:57] west side and last loss
[59:01] off of a street called
[59:06] you know it has been a Via Dolorosa
[59:10] a way of suffering
[59:13] but I want to tell you this morning we
[59:16] will not shirk our responsibilities
[59:22] because there are people that are
[59:25] depending on us
[59:27] I I don't know if you understand that
[59:30] but I'm going to say it again there are
[59:32] people that are depending on us
[59:36] and so so I I want to play this and it's
[59:40] it's about 15 minutes long you know

[1:03:16] Pastor Matthias and we are so blessed
[1:03:21] that we are going to share the testimony
[1:03:24] showing that the Lord we saw the Lord
[1:03:28] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:03:31] and forever
[1:03:34] uh one of our friends is Pastor Solomon
[1:03:38] he got actually the accident I think
[1:03:41] it's not now about it man a goal
[1:03:45] and the track ran over his leg
[1:03:50] it crushed it so terribly
[1:03:53] and she was rushed to hospital
[1:03:57] days passed by
[1:04:00] at first they thought they could do
[1:04:01] something
[1:04:02] but when uh brother Matthias went back
[1:04:05] now it's about two weeks
[1:04:08] uh he they he found when they had opened
[1:04:11] the leg
[1:04:12] and it was in a terrible state
[1:04:16] if you look at the pictures
[1:04:20] it was terrible
[1:04:22] he shared the pictures with uh Pastor
[1:04:25] Caleb
[1:04:26] and this was the reply
[1:04:30] the pictures were so scary
[1:04:32] if you look at them
[1:04:34] and the reply that Pastor sent him he
[1:04:38] forwarded it to me
[1:04:40] if I can remember it he said the
[1:04:43] ministry is praying we are believing
[1:04:46] with you all
[1:04:48] God is still a Healer and still doing
[1:04:53] miracles
[1:04:55] when I read that reply
[1:04:59] I I really something struck my heart
[1:05:04] and I said amen
[1:05:08] well just shortly after I talked to a
[1:05:10] pastor and
[1:05:13] where the Matthias according to the
[1:05:14] hospital the doctors that told him they
[1:05:17] had to amputate the leg
[1:05:19] so we talked
[1:05:21] and they needed them some money in the
[1:05:24] hospital to do that and after talking to
[1:05:27] a pastor
[1:05:28] said well yes let that money that is
[1:05:31] coming in do the work real quick so uh
[1:05:35] but Tommy had sent the man about two
[1:05:37] days back and I told him yes I'm
[1:05:40] expecting the money anytime and
[1:05:42] immediately I get it I'll send it to
[1:05:44] brother Matthias and they'll amputated
[1:05:46] the leg
[1:05:47] so
[1:05:49] and then somehow he talked back to
[1:05:52] brother Matthias he sent him a message
[1:05:54] and he said
[1:05:56] is that money to help the leg you know
[1:05:58] to be amputated or took out of the leg
[1:06:01] then when he forwarded that message back
[1:06:04] to me I said wow
[1:06:06] it seems real God doesn't want the
[1:06:09] brother's leg this is what I thought
[1:06:10] really in my heart I said why has Pastor
[1:06:13] asked this maybe God doesn't want the
[1:06:16] brothers elect to be amputated but you
[1:06:19] know these were just thoughts coming in
[1:06:20] like that
[1:06:21] well but we all thought since the
[1:06:24] doctors have said they have to do that
[1:06:26] that's what they had to do
[1:06:28] so uh well I I kept on waiting for the
[1:06:31] money
[1:06:32] that was second day then the third day I
[1:06:35] waited for the money
[1:06:37] it didn't come through and at this time
[1:06:39] you know we were like we want the money
[1:06:43] to come through very fast like that we
[1:06:45] were all Imagining the pain that brother
[1:06:46] someone was going through but
[1:06:48] surprisingly the managing to go through
[1:06:51] the Saturday first day see if they they
[1:06:56] managing to go through I kept talking to
[1:06:58] uh buddy told me and he kept talking
[1:07:00] back to me and we were like he checked
[1:07:02] in The Source Bank everything was fine
[1:07:05] I could keep asking the bank here they
[1:07:08] could say we don't see the money in the
[1:07:10] system
[1:07:11] I was like what what's going on
[1:07:13] look at the brother to you know to be
[1:07:14] helped quickly then we kept on just
[1:07:17] praying but in all this uh I thank God
[1:07:20] because when Pastor talked to me sending
[1:07:23] a voice note I could see the meekness in
[1:07:26] him and the settlings that peace in his
[1:07:28] heart
[1:07:29] so it touched me like wow let's just
[1:07:33] keep praying
[1:07:36] God knows so we kept praying we kept
[1:07:40] preparing and then
[1:07:42] uh the money didn't go through
[1:07:45] sixth day the money didn't go through
[1:07:47] friends I like we could keep Imagining
[1:07:51] the pain and then money is not going
[1:07:53] through all the days after the Eighth
[1:07:56] Day
[1:07:57] that's when I could receive the money
[1:08:00] almost when all of Hope Has Gone money
[1:08:03] came through
[1:08:07] oh thank you a lot
[1:08:09] I sent the money straight to brother
[1:08:11] Matthias and brother Matthias goes to
[1:08:13] the hospital and what happened again
[1:08:18] when brother Julia sent me the money
[1:08:21] I rushed to the hospital
[1:08:23] to see Brothers
[1:08:26] when I reached there
[1:08:29] to your time
[1:08:31] another new doctor comes in
[1:08:34] he didn't come for brothers he just came
[1:08:38] to pass around
[1:08:39] but when he's God
[1:09:08] [Applause]
[1:09:20] and imagine so the the brothers
[1:09:24] so the the doctors they said they are
[1:09:28] not going to amputate to the leg so we
[1:09:31] sent he sent back the message to brother
[1:09:33] to pastor and then
[1:09:36] surprisingly we looked at it we looked
[1:09:39] at everything and
[1:09:42] oh god look here
[1:09:44] money did not go through for all these
[1:09:48] eight days
[1:09:49] because it is the real I want this
[1:09:52] really to go down into our hearts for
[1:09:54] the real fast time ever since for all
[1:09:58] the years that body Tony has been
[1:10:00] sending the money through the account
[1:10:02] never not even one time has the money
[1:10:05] ever delayed it was the first time ever
[1:10:09] the money to be delayed for 80 Days why
[1:10:15] the ministry is praying
[1:10:18] we are all believing with you
[1:10:21] God is still a Healer
[1:10:24] and still doing Miracles we believe that
[1:10:27] changed everything
[1:10:30] it changed the system in the bank
[1:10:33] that it couldn't see the money for eight
[1:10:35] days because God was waiting for the
[1:10:38] right doctor
[1:10:39] to come on that day and that's when God
[1:10:43] wanted the money to come through
[1:10:45] who do you say this is
[1:10:48] oh God had better plans for brother
[1:10:51] Solomon that he kept the system of the
[1:10:54] bank and want to see the money for all
[1:10:57] those days

[1:15:02] adoration
[1:15:04] amen I pray that it blessed you this
[1:15:07] this morning
[1:15:11] now I got a question to ask you hello
[1:15:16] should I use that as part of the time of
[1:15:19] my message
[1:15:25] we'll see what the Lord has to say
[1:15:28] what a thing it is responsibility
[1:15:31] responsibility God bless them
[1:15:34] the voice of God to us the Commandments
[1:15:41] the commission that was left to us
[1:15:45] is our responsibility is
[1:15:50] I want to show you what the word
[1:15:52] responsibility is
[1:15:55] I don't think I'm gonna get to the God
[1:15:57] of this Earth so so if if I don't get
[1:16:00] there then just change the subtitle to
[1:16:02] responsibility
[1:16:05] there you go the state of being
[1:16:08] answerable
[1:16:12] accountable for something within one's
[1:16:16] power
[1:16:17] that troll or management
[1:16:25] it's the reason that many don't have a
[1:16:28] or do not like responsibility nowadays
[1:16:33] because they do not want to give an
[1:16:35] account for what they do and and their
[1:16:38] actions
[1:16:40] but responsibility once again
[1:16:44] is the state of being answerable
[1:16:49] accountable for something within one's
[1:16:52] power
[1:16:55] this is why brother Branham says that
[1:16:57] that power without character is satanic
[1:17:03] because character is what pushes you to
[1:17:06] be accountable
[1:17:10] because there's no accountability
[1:17:15] people think that real
[1:17:21] you know
[1:17:23] yes or yes so you'll see I'm going to
[1:17:25] say it again people think that real
[1:17:27] power
[1:17:29] they can do whatever they want
[1:17:32] they don't have to give an account for
[1:17:35] anything
[1:17:36] but let me tell you this this fine
[1:17:39] morning
[1:17:41] that's what responsibility does
[1:17:46] that makes you accountable
[1:17:49] for everything you say
[1:17:52] everything you think
[1:17:55] everything that you do
[1:17:58] our ability
[1:18:00] stability and responsibility
[1:18:04] irresponsibility it grows when we
[1:18:08] increase our sense of accountability to
[1:18:11] God
[1:18:16] man had a responsibility to God
[1:18:21] but he also had a response possibility
[1:18:24] to the Earth
[1:18:26] they had a responsibility to the fish of
[1:18:30] the sea responsibility he had a
[1:18:33] responsibility to the fowl of the air
[1:18:34] responsibility and to everything that
[1:18:38] was moving upon the Earth
[1:18:41] and his responsibility continued to grow
[1:18:45] so responsibility
[1:18:47] as God of the Earth
[1:18:50] the atom was God of the Earth
[1:18:53] let me see your hands if you really know
[1:18:56] it
[1:18:56] he was God of the earth
[1:18:59] there is nothing as destructive as
[1:19:03] irresponsibility
[1:19:07] I want you to repeat that can you just
[1:19:09] tell your neighbor neighbor
[1:19:11] there is nothing as destructive
[1:19:14] as irresponsibility
[1:19:18] and the word irresponsibility is just
[1:19:21] the opposite right responsibility not
[1:19:24] capable or qualified for
[1:19:26] responsibilities
[1:19:30] it is not answerable or accountable to a
[1:19:33] higher authority
[1:19:39] irresponsibility
[1:19:41] irresponsibility is unable to respond to
[1:19:44] conscience
[1:19:47] no one nowadays wants to take
[1:19:50] responsibility for their actions
[1:19:55] we always love to transfer our
[1:19:59] inexcusable Behavior
[1:20:04] to everyone and anyone that is around us
[1:20:09] my question is where do you stand and
[1:20:11] this morning
[1:20:13] we as human beings
[1:20:16] you've never seen a day like today
[1:20:20] where the blame game is played more than
[1:20:23] any other time
[1:20:26] it's amazing how much we want to blame
[1:20:29] someone else for our for our actions and
[1:20:31] and and the consequences we endure
[1:20:38] you see people I'm gonna change Banks
[1:20:43] they repossessed my house or my car
[1:20:47] like it's the bank's fault
[1:20:51] that you didn't pay the bill you know is
[1:20:55] that right we always want to transfer
[1:20:57] the blame somewhere
[1:21:00] they turned my electricity off
[1:21:03] oh man they're so mean
[1:21:07] why did you go shopping when you knew
[1:21:10] you had a bill to pay
[1:21:13] we blame the preacher for our condition
[1:21:18] but I'm going to tell you this morning
[1:21:20] quit trying to blame the preacher yes
[1:21:32] we come to the altar to get prayed
[1:21:35] foreign
[1:22:10] for prayer because our spirit is all
[1:22:13] messed up
[1:22:15] we cannot sleep at night we don't have
[1:22:18] peace
[1:22:20] we have headaches
[1:22:22] instead of praying for people
[1:22:25] I think a lot of times we should just be
[1:22:28] straight up and ask the questions
[1:22:31] who are you talking bad about
[1:22:36] is that right because everybody wants
[1:22:38] just a quick fix all the time
[1:22:40] would you speak evil
[1:22:44] what bad thoughts overtook you this week
[1:22:49] go make those things right and you'll
[1:22:52] feel much better
[1:22:55] we're used to playing the blame game
[1:22:59] we are the people that are responsible
[1:23:02] for a lot
[1:23:05] because much has been given us
[1:23:09] I'm going to say it again much has been
[1:23:12] given to us
[1:23:14] how many of you have your Bible here
[1:23:16] today
[1:23:17] let me see that let me hold it up if you
[1:23:20] got your Bible this
[1:23:24] is your book or someone else's book is
[1:23:30] this is my book it's me Libro but by
[1:23:33] taking possession of this book
[1:23:37] you have now taken on the greatest
[1:23:40] responsibility known to man
[1:23:43] responsibility
[1:23:45] let me see how many of you still steal
[1:23:47] your book
[1:23:49] but if this is your book yes you're
[1:23:52] responsible what for what is in this
[1:23:54] Pages
[1:23:56] hello everybody hola I'm going to say it
[1:24:00] again how many of you is this your book
[1:24:03] and you're responsible once again
[1:24:06] or what is in this book for the
[1:24:10] responsibility as a Believer
[1:24:13] is to live this word
[1:24:16] to make this word do what it says it
[1:24:19] will do
[1:24:20] this is your responsibility to make it
[1:24:24] alive in your generation
[1:24:28] sounds a huge response ability that we
[1:24:31] have responsibility
[1:24:33] how many have taken the message of the
[1:24:35] hour personal to you
[1:24:39] then you are responsible for that
[1:24:42] message
[1:24:44] Genesis chapter 2 and verse 16 says
[1:24:48] and the Lord God commanded the man
[1:24:51] there's the Commandment
[1:24:54] this is a responsibility
[1:24:57] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[1:25:00] mayest freely eat
[1:25:04] but of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[1:25:06] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it
[1:25:10] for in the day that thou eat is thereof
[1:25:13] Thou shalt surely die
[1:25:16] Adam knew that his responsibility was to
[1:25:20] the father's Commandments
[1:25:24] and then God did something for Adam
[1:25:28] that brought on a whole new
[1:25:30] responsibility
[1:25:33] verse 22
[1:25:35] and the rib
[1:25:38] which the Lord God had taken from man
[1:25:43] made here woman is
[1:25:49] for the first time
[1:25:51] man had a responsibility to take care of
[1:25:54] his books
[1:25:57] I'm building up to this now so that you
[1:26:00] understand
[1:26:01] he was the god of the Earth
[1:26:04] but there were things that were
[1:26:06] continuing to come forth
[1:26:09] his responsibility began to grow
[1:26:14] but it wasn't long before Satan threw
[1:26:17] the serpent got to his wife
[1:26:23] and then through her God to him
[1:26:28] God had put him in the garden
[1:26:31] and now God was taking him out of the
[1:26:34] garden
[1:26:35] and there's a lot of people nowadays
[1:26:39] being put out of what they were one is
[1:26:42] put into it
[1:26:46] come on now I I I I I gotta say that one
[1:26:50] more time he said but God placed me here
[1:26:53] but by your responsibility
[1:27:01] how important it is that we understand
[1:27:03] these things
[1:27:06] have you ever thought of all the many
[1:27:08] things that God has not given us
[1:27:13] because we are not responsible enough to
[1:27:16] handle them
[1:27:19] how many things that God desires to give
[1:27:22] us
[1:27:26] but we are not responsible enough
[1:27:30] responsibles brother Ram says in a man
[1:27:32] running from the presence of the Lord
[1:27:35] when Adam was in the Garden of Eden
[1:27:39] when he come to the responsibility
[1:27:43] to make his choice
[1:27:45] would he stay with God or go with his
[1:27:48] wife
[1:27:50] the responsibility was up to him
[1:27:55] he either had to take what his wife said
[1:27:58] or what God Said
[1:28:01] and when he chose to go the way of his
[1:28:04] wife
[1:28:06] then he lost his original
[1:28:12] conditional
[1:28:13] irresponsibility the responsibility does
[1:28:16] as I said produces blame
[1:28:19] and once again
[1:28:21] the blame game continued
[1:28:25] to blame the wife or the woman
[1:28:29] the woman blamed the serpenter and after
[1:28:34] the fall
[1:28:35] then was to come A different kind of
[1:28:39] responsibility
[1:28:41] a covenant for the man
[1:28:46] his responsibility to responsibility
[1:28:49] that person is the ground for thy sake
[1:28:55] and by the sweat of thy face shalt thou
[1:28:58] eat foreign
[1:29:49] but through it all now listen closely
[1:29:52] but through it all
[1:29:54] they also have the responsibility
[1:29:59] of raising the product of their
[1:30:02] irresponsibility
[1:30:07] oh church I want you to get this because
[1:30:09] this this is where we live today
[1:30:12] we know what we're responsible foreign
[1:30:31] the product of irresponsibility
[1:30:37] wears people down today it is
[1:30:42] building with a product that was
[1:30:45] produced by being irresponsible
[1:30:50] I deal with it all the time
[1:30:55] brother my marriage
[1:30:58] you chose him
[1:31:02] you chose her
[1:31:08] my children
[1:31:10] you chose not to apply the token is
[1:31:15] and now we're saying I need help
[1:31:18] the help was
[1:31:20] giveness
[1:31:26] you're uncomfortable no no I comforted
[1:31:30] it's the biggest hindrance of of why we
[1:31:32] are not responsible in many things
[1:31:37] because it's uncomfortable
[1:31:41] that's why we don't we don't many times
[1:31:43] tell others about the Lord
[1:31:46] because we got a little uncomfortable
[1:31:49] well my my finances brother
[1:31:53] you choose to live outside of your means
[1:31:59] and every time we are irresponsible
[1:32:03] every time we choose to disbelieve God's
[1:32:06] word yes
[1:32:08] every time we think that we are not
[1:32:10] accountable to anyone
[1:32:13] the product is
[1:32:19] come on church I'm going to say it again
[1:32:21] a product is birth
[1:32:24] and then you'll live the rest of your
[1:32:27] lives
[1:32:28] because you never plucked It Up by The
[1:32:30] Roots
[1:32:33] you'll live the rest of your life
[1:32:35] pruning branches off of that bush
[1:32:43] hello everybody hola
[1:32:47] pruning the same Bush all the time
[1:32:52] Bush should have been plucked up by the
[1:32:54] roof I know the uh
[1:32:57] anybody here
[1:32:59] same problem over and over again
[1:33:04] a month later
[1:33:06] get rid of the bush mismo
[1:33:21] hello everyone hola
[1:33:25] why people are okay for a little while
[1:33:33] gain the product of our irresponsibility
[1:33:41] and then another responsibility
[1:33:44] responsibility the brother hit is so
[1:33:46] good on when we were when we were in
[1:33:48] Tucson
[1:33:49] estamos in Tucson another responsibility
[1:33:53] arrives
[1:33:56] the responsibility the responsibility of
[1:34:00] Brotherhood
[1:34:02] yeah
[1:34:04] amen
[1:34:07] I want to let that one sink in for a
[1:34:09] little bit
[1:34:11] how many of you know that in in Genesis
[1:34:14] chapter 4 in Genesis Capital cuatro one
[1:34:17] through eleven
[1:34:18] story of Cain and Abel you all know that
[1:34:22] if you know that how many times the word
[1:34:24] brother is used there is
[1:34:29] it is used seven times
[1:34:33] not by coincidence
[1:34:35] think about that for a moment the
[1:34:38] broader Brotherhood is that important to
[1:34:41] God
[1:34:44] seven times it's used
[1:34:48] then it's a decision
[1:34:51] take on the responsibility
[1:34:54] responsibility taking care of your
[1:34:57] brothers
[1:34:58] it's a responsibility
[1:35:01] oh we're going to get to something here
[1:35:04] in a moment
[1:35:06] can you answer the question
[1:35:10] where is your brother
[1:35:13] Su Hermano
[1:35:18] in the middle there's seven in Medio I
[1:35:21] see a three three and in the middle
[1:35:23] dress yes when God asks the question
[1:35:28] where is your brother
[1:35:32] when I look at this on the Middle East
[1:35:34] we gotta know how to answer this
[1:35:37] question
[1:35:38] the only way to answer it you got to
[1:35:42] know first of all where you're standing
[1:35:47] and then you can know where your brother
[1:35:49] is standing
[1:35:50] the word standing means
[1:35:53] we've been talking about where do you
[1:35:55] stand the world standing is your
[1:35:59] s
[1:36:00] your status you're
[1:36:04] positioned
[1:36:08] if we're going to go through the process
[1:36:09] of being restored back to our position
[1:36:15] shouldn't we be taking a hold of our
[1:36:17] responsibilities right now you know
[1:36:24] yeah
[1:36:26] we can be very good and very responsible
[1:36:28] in some areas
[1:36:32] But as God of the earth
[1:36:35] Adam didn't have wasn't able to choose
[1:36:38] what he wanted to be responsible about
[1:36:43] is that right he couldn't pick and
[1:36:46] choose and say well I'll be responsible
[1:36:48] for the fish but not the not the fouls
[1:36:56] he knew where he was standing
[1:36:59] and everything God wants us to do
[1:37:04] comes our responsibility
[1:37:08] if you feel a responsibility towards
[1:37:10] people
[1:37:11] responsibility
[1:37:13] do you ever notice sometimes you feel a
[1:37:15] responsibility only towards certain
[1:37:17] people uh
[1:37:22] okay let me stop here for a minute right
[1:37:25] let me see how many of you are response
[1:37:28] still a responsibility towards people
[1:37:32] put our responsibility towards all
[1:37:34] people oh
[1:37:41] yeah I better change my message
[1:37:44] what do you think
[1:37:47] keep going okay
[1:37:51] why don't do not we feel a
[1:37:53] responsibility for all people Alma
[1:38:02] what's wrong somewhere something's wrong
[1:38:05] if I can't see someone out there and and
[1:38:07] my heart go out to them something's
[1:38:09] wrong
[1:38:10] something's wrong with me I don't have
[1:38:12] to look at anyone else there's a
[1:38:15] responsibility that has been laid Upon
[1:38:18] Our shoulders
[1:38:27] when I see this
[1:38:29] the real question is not how if we feel
[1:38:34] a responsibility or not
[1:38:38] the real question is how much
[1:38:41] responsibility are we willing to take
[1:38:43] responsibility
[1:38:47] well I did that last month so I'm going
[1:38:49] to take a break this month
[1:38:53] it's easy to do that when your bellies
[1:38:55] are full
[1:38:58] when everything is going good it's easy
[1:39:00] to take a little break right
[1:39:02] when somebody's dying
[1:39:06] and they're they're they're waiting
[1:39:09] they're what they're needing something
[1:39:12] and they're relying on us
[1:39:15] how can we take a break
[1:39:19] think about these things the Internet
[1:39:21] it's a sacrifice to take on more
[1:39:24] responsibility
[1:39:26] the question is how many of you are
[1:39:29] willing to take on more responsibility
[1:39:35] people are relying on you
[1:39:37] they're relying on us
[1:39:40] every prophet and every Sage
[1:39:44] the Apostle every Minister
[1:39:47] every person has had to face up to the
[1:39:51] responsibility
[1:39:55] of why they were sent to their age
[1:39:59] their day and their hours
[1:40:04] and we also have to come to the
[1:40:06] conclusion of our responsibility
[1:40:10] why were we sent to this day at this age
[1:40:15] what's the purpose
[1:40:18] I have a lot of businesses and then have
[1:40:20] a good job there's some nice things here
[1:40:22] in this earth
[1:40:24] the extent of our responsibility
[1:40:31] sometimes I I was I was hearing I was
[1:40:34] hearing our pastor the other day
[1:40:37] and he says how many of you are going
[1:40:40] with me to Colorado
[1:40:43] and hardly nobody raised their hands
[1:40:47] he said are you serious
[1:40:49] all that God has done
[1:40:52] now you don't want to go
[1:40:57] we got better cars better houses foreign
[1:41:57] every man that come on the face of the
[1:42:00] Earth
[1:42:01] has to answer to God for our
[1:42:04] responsibility
[1:42:07] and to many of us
[1:42:09] stewardship yeah
[1:42:12] we have to answer for it
[1:42:16] this responsibility is the
[1:42:19] responsibility is a stewardship
[1:42:21] that's been committed to us by God
[1:42:28] he says I don't care what it is
[1:42:31] we have a responsibility
[1:42:35] and we'll answer to God for the
[1:42:37] stewardship of our responsibility
[1:42:43] we recorded a four-part series uh week
[1:42:46] ago
[1:42:49] and uh I I I believe that it would be a
[1:42:53] wonderful thing for all of you to hear
[1:42:55] okay
[1:43:00] why we don't believe in just listening
[1:43:03] to tapes
[1:43:06] we are not against anyone that does that
[1:43:10] understand our heart is
[1:43:14] but there is a responsibility that the
[1:43:18] message gives us
[1:43:21] we must listen to the tapes
[1:43:24] that's our source but the source needs a
[1:43:28] channel to flow through
[1:43:31] if we have the source but no channels
[1:43:35] what is the source La Fuente
[1:43:39] it's not to attack anyone that does that
[1:43:41] is
[1:43:42] the purpose of doing these things but
[1:43:45] our purpose is this is
[1:43:48] that in the message through the
[1:43:52] scriptures
[1:43:53] responsibility has been placed the
[1:43:56] responsibility on our laps
[1:43:58] the question is how much responsibility
[1:44:01] are we willing to take responsibility
[1:44:07] yes sir
[1:44:09] it's much easier not to preach yes
[1:44:13] see Hello everybody hola
[1:44:17] much easier
[1:44:18] not to have to stay away from your
[1:44:20] family
[1:44:21] for hours and hours
[1:44:26] so much easier
[1:44:28] spend hours upon hours
[1:44:42] but I want to tell you this is Brother
[1:44:45] Brown says this is hard to say this is
[1:44:48] difficult but it's true
[1:44:51] that ministers many times
[1:44:55] they shirk a responsibility evidence for
[1:45:00] standing for the true word of God
[1:45:06] confronted with it
[1:45:08] they'll shirk that responsibility
[1:45:12] when the truth of the word of God is
[1:45:15] brought face to face
[1:45:20] with us human beings
[1:45:23] we are prone to shirt back
[1:45:26] estamos this uh
[1:45:44] you'll answer and I will too for what we
[1:45:46] say and what we don't say
[1:45:55] it's easy to dodge our responsibilities
[1:46:00] but we cannot Dodge the consequences of
[1:46:04] dodging our responsibilities
[1:46:09] we are responsible for this church
[1:46:12] Iglesia
[1:46:16] not I am responsible
[1:46:19] I am responsible but it doesn't lay on
[1:46:24] just the pastor to be responsible
[1:46:26] we all are responsible
[1:46:30] for this church foreign
[1:47:03] this is our responsibility to God
[1:47:07] and I want I want this to hit home
[1:47:11] because a church is made up of offices
[1:47:15] he says these offices
[1:47:19] are your responsibility to God
[1:47:23] responsibility
[1:47:29] I'm going to preach a different message
[1:47:31] today
[1:47:33] come on now we have a responsibility
[1:47:35] we're going to answer to God foreign
[1:47:42] they are your responsibility to God
[1:47:46] I'm saying it here tonight
[1:47:50] because it's my responsibility to God
[1:47:54] and then he says it's your
[1:47:57] responsibility
[1:48:00] foreign
[1:49:04] why did you stop preaching
[1:49:09] because somebody said I shouldn't preach
[1:49:11] anymore
[1:49:12] how much is that going to hold anyway
[1:49:20] responsibility is not to man in that
[1:49:22] sense
[1:49:26] it's to the commission it's true what he
[1:49:29] called us to do
[1:49:31] he sent us in this age
[1:49:34] we are way too comfortable this morning
[1:49:38] come on now let him Shake us a little
[1:49:42] bit
[1:49:44] amen because everything else is so much
[1:49:47] more important
[1:49:50] we shirk our responsibility to fill
[1:49:53] these offices
[1:49:56] where then is the problem
[1:49:59] brother Brian says being brought into
[1:50:01] the presence of God
[1:50:06] when God made a promise
[1:50:09] God is obligated to that promise
[1:50:13] and when he brings that promise to pass
[1:50:17] then people are afraid to face up to the
[1:50:20] responsibility
[1:50:24] of coping with the message of the hour
[1:50:39] to the responsibility
[1:50:42] of coping with the message of the hours
[1:50:49] are you coping with the message of the
[1:50:51] hours
[1:50:56] that's a question
[1:50:58] and I want to know how we're going to
[1:51:00] answer that question is
[1:51:03] to deal effectively is
[1:51:07] are we dealing effectively with the
[1:51:10] message of the hours
[1:51:19] we're afraid to take on the
[1:51:21] responsibility
[1:51:23] responsibility think about it because
[1:51:26] when we look at those videos
[1:51:28] how is it possible
[1:51:31] that so many things God has done there
[1:51:36] imagine Moses when he left the when he
[1:51:39] left Egypt with the children of Israel
[1:51:44] Pueblo the responsibility of two million
[1:51:49] responsibility
[1:51:52] how was he going to feed them elementar
[1:51:58] come on now vamos the problem is that
[1:52:00] we're afraid because we can't figure out
[1:52:03] how we're gonna do something
[1:52:06] God never asked you if you if or how
[1:52:09] you're gonna do it
[1:52:12] and take it
[1:52:14] I'm willing send me this question I
[1:52:17] don't know how I'm gonna buy my ticket I
[1:52:20] don't know how I'm gonna pay for this or
[1:52:21] that
[1:52:23] Lord I'm gonna go at your word
[1:52:26] feed 2 million
[1:52:53] how many clothes will they wear out
[1:52:56] where will they get the clothes
[1:52:59] where will I feed them
[1:53:02] I've come to them as a leader
[1:53:05] how will I be able to do it
[1:53:09] and maybe even in our homes we ask I
[1:53:12] don't know how we're going to do this
[1:53:15] you think it didn't go through my mind
[1:53:18] how we're going to feed all these
[1:53:20] brothers and sisters in Uganda
[1:53:24] I will take care of so many people both
[1:53:27] physically and spiritually
[1:53:31] yes I am a human being
[1:53:34] the question Lord how yeah
[1:53:37] but God isn't isn't interested in our
[1:53:40] questions of how we're going to do it
[1:53:44] because it's not us doing it to begin

[2:04:28] time
[2:04:31] oh no no no
[2:04:33] it's the duty of we as pastors
[2:04:45] because God Almighty
[2:04:48] will require your blood
[2:04:51] our hands
[2:04:53] at the day of judgment
[2:04:57] that's not an easy responsibility
[2:05:01] it's a great tremendous responsibility
[2:05:05] and God has given us people who love us
[2:05:10] to hear us and we should spend our time

[2:05:43] we don't want to be ministers by title
[2:05:45] though
[2:05:48] we want to be ministered by
[2:05:50] responsibility
[2:05:52] that we have taken on
[2:05:57] the invisible Union of the Bride now
[2:06:00] what a sacred trust
[2:06:04] ability to a woman
[2:06:07] she's a type of the church
[2:06:09] which has the same responsibility
[2:06:12] as a woman as sacred responsibility to
[2:06:15] her motherhood
[2:06:20] to her virtues to her husband we do this
[2:06:23] as the church has a sacred
[2:06:25] responsibility
[2:06:28] prayer
[2:06:31] to Christ a crystal just the same as the
[2:06:34] woman
[2:06:35] don't you see that we all have a
[2:06:37] responsibility
[2:06:40] not just as pastors ministers on all of
[2:06:45] us as we honor God
[2:06:50] we honor him because we take
[2:06:52] responsibility
[2:06:54] why we know we got to know where we are
[2:06:57] standing
[2:06:58] God will never bless a Believer outside
[2:07:01] their position
[2:07:04] just like he will not bless Israel
[2:07:07] outside of their Homeland
[2:07:09] Israel
[2:07:11] man lost his position
[2:07:16] being irresponsible
[2:07:22] don't lose what you have because you're
[2:07:24] irresponsible
[2:07:26] the man had a position with God
[2:07:30] but forfeited
[2:07:32] he forfeited the right to save his wife
[2:07:37] and in doing so he lost his position
[2:07:42] what was his position
[2:07:44] he was the god of the earth
[2:07:47] he lost that by being irresponsible for
[2:07:52] said irresponsible he had all creation
[2:07:55] at his feet
[2:07:57] he lost it he forfeited brother Branham
[2:08:01] says
[2:08:02] imagine the responsibility
[2:08:06] what he would have to answer foreign
[2:08:12] for being the god of the earth
[2:08:15] we struggle
[2:08:17] with the responsibility of running our
[2:08:20] homes
[2:08:25] hello everybody hola
[2:08:28] well my wife said she would leave me
[2:08:30] I heard this or that you know wow
[2:08:40] what a thing because it happens
[2:08:43] I see pasta so the man stays there and
[2:08:46] can never grow anymore
[2:08:48] because he found another God
[2:08:55] man is responsible to God
[2:08:59] for becoming what God has made possible
[2:09:02] for him to become
[2:09:06] but all sin has to do is make you
[2:09:09] irresponsible towards your commission
[2:09:14] your position your office
[2:09:18] to doubt it one bit
[2:09:25] each fire
[2:09:28] what a struggle it is
[2:09:33] when God made man
[2:09:35] he was
[2:09:38] a god of the Earth
[2:09:40] the man was El hombre uh god of the
[2:09:45] Earth
[2:09:50] I don't know if I should get into this
[2:09:51] because this would take me a little
[2:09:53] while
[2:09:57] we won't have service tonight
[2:10:00] just real lightly
[2:10:04] but but just but just come with me for a
[2:10:07] little bit because it might go against a
[2:10:09] little bit of what we know
[2:10:12] he lost also his inheritance
[2:10:16] when he lost his fellowship and right
[2:10:21] the day you eat of it the day you die
[2:10:24] when he lost his life he also lost his
[2:10:28] inheritance in life
[2:10:30] because he had complete control Supreme
[2:10:34] control
[2:10:35] of the earth
[2:10:37] he was a god of the earth
[2:10:40] he is the god of God is the god of the
[2:10:44] universe
[2:10:45] everywhere but his son have this Earth
[2:10:51] under his own control
[2:10:55] now we should first of all look in the
[2:10:57] mirror and say but before I look at this
[2:11:02] do I have this this Earth under control
[2:11:08] we should have it under control by now
[2:11:12] but we have wandering eyes sometimes
[2:11:19] come on now bye I'm gonna get to
[2:11:21] something good right now
[2:11:22] once again here we are his son have this
[2:11:28] Earth under his own control he could
[2:11:32] speak he could name
[2:11:35] he could stop nature let's do anything
[2:11:39] he wanted to yes but when he did that he
[2:11:43] lost his inheritance
[2:11:45] now Satan wanted to be God of this Earth
[2:11:48] is that right
[2:11:50] but that position
[2:11:52] that title
[2:11:56] belonged to Adam
[2:11:58] Long and not just to Adam
[2:12:01] to every son that was to come
[2:12:05] and when Adam forfeited it
[2:12:08] was ready we know this he was ready to
[2:12:12] take that title deed book of redemption
[2:12:18] slip right out of his hands
[2:12:21] back to the original owner
[2:12:25] because Satan could not feel is
[2:13:36] for the Earth was made for man and not
[2:13:39] man for the Earth
[2:13:42] but I want you to notice this now
[2:13:45] goodness gracious oh yeah I want you to
[2:13:49] get this now
[2:13:51] Paul never calls Satan
[2:14:05] let's see what he calls him second
[2:14:07] Corinthians 4 4.
[2:14:11] in whom the God of this world
[2:14:16] he names them the God of this world
[2:14:20] blinded the minds of them which believe
[2:14:23] not
[2:14:25] incredible once again he never calls him
[2:14:27] God of the Earth
[2:14:29] but God of this world produces brother
[2:14:32] Branham clarifies
[2:14:35] he is the God of this evil age
[2:14:39] he has set up shop but he is a squatter
[2:14:45] and three times trespasses the Apostle
[2:14:49] John Juan records what Jesus referred to
[2:14:53] Satan as
[2:14:55] he always referred to him as the ruler
[2:14:58] of this world
[2:15:00] we are in the world the most age
[2:15:06] and once again man lost his position
[2:15:12] he was the god of the Earth
[2:15:17] but praise be to God
[2:15:20] when the lamb went forth and took that
[2:15:23] title deep book of redemption
[2:15:35] the price was paid when Christ died at
[2:15:37] Calvary
[2:15:40] but it had not been claimed yet
[2:15:44] till this end times
[2:15:51] listen to what the prophet of God says I
[2:15:55] love this yes a redeemed man
[2:15:59] he is the seventh angel messenger
[2:16:03] there was a Heavenly messenger
[2:16:06] but there's also an Earthly message
[2:16:10] he receives the book receiver Libro and
[2:16:14] John a type of the Bride eats it
[2:16:16] in the Book of Revelation
[2:16:21] office along with its title god of the
[2:16:26] earth
[2:16:27] now been restored back to man
[2:16:30] since the time that Adam forfeited
[2:16:35] the title god of the Earth was lost to
[2:16:38] man
[2:16:41] until after Revelations chapter 10.
[2:16:46] say it again there comes Revelations
[2:16:52] says here
[2:16:55] immediately after Revelations 10.
[2:16:59] and I will give power unto my two
[2:17:03] witnesses
[2:17:04] and they shall prophesy a thousand two
[2:17:06] hundred three score days clothed in
[2:17:08] sackcloth foreign
[2:17:54] I want to know this this morning because
[2:17:57] it is about most important
[2:17:59] have you ever stood before the god of
[2:18:02] the Earth
[2:18:07] hello everybody
[2:18:08] I'm gonna say it again have you ever
[2:18:10] stood before the god of the earth
[2:18:12] here we find two prophets
[2:18:16] standing before the god of the earth
[2:18:20] two olive trees
[2:18:23] two candlesticks
[2:18:26] oh come on now
[2:18:28] almost what are these two candlesticks
[2:18:32] they're the prophet it says it's the
[2:18:34] prophet the prophets
[2:18:36] keep reading though there's truth in
[2:18:39] what you're saying open it up a little
[2:18:41] bit more Church
[2:18:42] you gotta see it's a picture unfolding
[2:18:53] you'll see that one in fine linen he was
[2:18:56] a man
[2:18:59] watch what he is
[2:19:09] god of the Earth
[2:19:12] when the whole church comes together
[2:19:16] not a god of the earth anymore
[2:19:25] the body of Christ
[2:19:28] come together
[2:19:30] let's see what he says here oh I wish I
[2:19:34] had this I don't know if I brought it or
[2:19:36] not but I gotta say it anyways watch
[2:19:39] these two revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:19:43] Elijah for the fourth time
[2:19:46] returns back in the spirit
[2:19:48] so they'll come back and run and be
[2:19:52] killed
[2:19:53] in the spiritual street called Sodom is
[2:19:58] the Lord was crucified Jerusalem
[2:20:03] preaching to the Jews
[2:20:09] but watch what he says
[2:20:12] end of the Gentile Ministries
[2:20:16] will carry over
[2:20:20] and connect with that connect come on
[2:20:25] now this is the overlap now
[2:20:28] stop dealing with the Gentiles and then
[2:20:30] start with the Jews
[2:20:40] that's right and in the overlap period
[2:20:44] transfer is made
[2:20:47] we heard this by our founding Pastor on
[2:20:50] that panel on Wednesdays
[2:20:53] notice this how important it is
[2:20:56] he says we'll go with them
[2:21:01] I don't know he said this Gentile
[2:21:03] Ministry
[2:21:05] I know there will be the seven
[2:21:07] Messengers there
[2:21:09] this is just for a moment
[2:21:12] but it's a transferring oh I love the
[2:21:14] way our founding Pastor said
[2:21:18] it's the same as Jacob
[2:21:21] that right before antis right before he
[2:21:25] meets Esau
[2:21:26] the Catholic Church
[2:21:30] an angel comes to him
[2:21:33] who's this jacob this Israel
[2:21:45] how is he wrestling with his Prophet
[2:21:49] because he's asking him questions
[2:21:52] then he's saying what's about this this
[2:21:55] atonement
[2:21:57] let me explain a little bit but then the
[2:22:00] sun is about to rise
[2:22:43] these two witnesses standing
[2:22:46] in other words they have come back to
[2:22:48] their positions
[2:22:50] back to their place
[2:22:53] as prophets of Israel
[2:22:56] standing before the capital G but a lot
[2:23:00] of the
[2:23:32] his body his mystical body is there
[2:23:35] foreign
[2:23:39] it is
[2:23:44] wait here watch now let me wrong I know
[2:23:48] there's there's a one man that is
[2:23:49] showing this that's typing all this is
[2:23:52] I'm going to be finished
[2:23:55] where is this big fellow this is in the
[2:23:58] sardisian church age
[2:24:07] he's in Christo
[2:24:36] because after all this world was not
[2:24:40] given for God to control
[2:24:45] let's notice that right who is the god
[2:24:50] of the earth
[2:24:51] who is the god of the earth he says
[2:24:57] [Music]
[2:24:58] just any man no he says
[2:25:02] who is this man
[2:25:04] can be plural plural
[2:25:08] but when we come together it's just
[2:25:10] Christ
[2:25:13] who is this God of the Earth
[2:25:15] on that his domain is
[2:25:19] all everything in the earth
[2:25:22] subject to the mass
[2:25:28] redeeming power he comes back again
[2:25:32] as the Earth belongs to me
[2:25:36] given to him he was ruler over
[2:25:39] everything oh

[2:26:14] God
[2:27:15] what kind of responsibility should
[2:27:33] how much more responsibility

[2:27:41] the god of the Earth
[2:27:50] but who else is
