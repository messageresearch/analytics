This is Jeremiah 29 12 and 13. Anton says I will hearken unto you is and ye shall seek me and find me porque when maybe search for me with all your heart Lord bring the controls that your Holy Spirit would lead us through prayer that we can have that correct to be able to enter into the spirit and have communion with you in the prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is our prayer please have a seat make yourself comfortable it was about this man that would tell his Pastor yes I can put rocks in this wheelbarrow and go and nothing will happen to me how many have heard the story I can also put you on that wheelbarrow and and go to the same road oh the Pastor said no no no wait a minute when it gets personal that's when things change when we speak about prayer and we don't speak that this is personal effect it will have no effect he recommends that the ministers that preach the gospel before speech let me open my heart to you a little bit and share something with you yeah we'll help you have a more intimate relationship with the Lord I love so much the character of David porque when he said to the Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me he found something foreign in Psalms 119 they say I have searched for you with all of my heart that my heart might not Wander from your Commandments importante has the most important part when we speak about prayer El Corazon the heart is that's what God has chosen for it to be his throne God is a holy God is the god of righteousness glows in your heart in my heart they will be in your favor those are the clean Hearts because they shall see God they shall see God what is that word see there means that's when you can have access face to face hold up to be able to see you face to face I have to have access because they shall see God they will have access to God they also have confidence with God it will have intimacy with God to be able to go into the spirit you can pray but if your heart is not right you will never see God foreign it seems like the more you pray those things go worse because the devil laughs at you because these are the keys the keys to be able to go into the spirit to go to hell and tell satanos lose my brothers sickness just get out of here if I can search my own heart and before you can have an audience with God I gotta find out if I have anything against anybody if your heart condemns you not confiance you have confidence with God I'm again my friend puedo better when I can see God just give me five more minutes you're gonna need maybe not tonight it's for all your life but Jesus because you have done what I have said he is my friend Amigo and now friends I like to walk with my friends and when I'm walking with my friends the problems my friend has problems because he's my friend yes maybe I can stop at any time in the day what is happening give me with this I'm going to finish deity of Jesus Christ there is I want you to understand the plan the Bible says those that are waiting because they could not enter in timidated and intimacy with God to be able to know his plan brother it's just the body of the Lord Jesus is the most sickest body we all claim to believe but when God sends the instrument when God is going to use the agent we rejected because our heart is not clean because your heart is not clean they say Jesus Jesus says the Kingdom of Heaven as a child as a child the children now fight yes playing with one another personal because the little children don't take it so personal the heart of the child is pure I played oh there's there's bitings among the little children but there's nothing that marks their heart brother Venom says a paragraph 97 this is and today that's what's the matter with the church La Esperanza de Gloria the hope of glory El bautism the baptism of the Holy ghosts it's coming today hallelujah amen yes that you can get a hold of this is where the Holy Ghost comes foreign or something like that but that it is and giving you all the powers we are members of that body and you're in possession of anything that he's had it also is you're also in possession of the same thing it's also in you that you would abstain from evil to do good says what is the holy spirit foreign you turn away from of all malice all hate it and so forth Apartments turn away from it for that and that'll take him from your heart think my brother the Holy Spirit the creator of that person that comes to live in you and you would rather hate he lives you're here but he's not here with you see you see what it's foreign [Applause] that was his worst fight against himself amen if you receive him Embrace him love him maintain him in your heart amelo love him I can tell you la Iglesia Unida that the United Church and that kind of power Los Cielos they have power to close the heavens you heal the sickos you open the eyes of the blinds the devil here those that can speak or speak those that can't hear them and the invalid ones to recognize the power of the all-powerful one in Su Corazon in your heart there he is if you would like to pray with me if you would like to make yourself comfortable maybe you won't want to kneel the protocol to come together foreign there's only one way Lord That Forgives our sins that gives us the gift of the Holy Spirit to put us in positions and Daughters of you Lord take these words and put them in the hearts of your children we ask you to forgive our sins Lord help us to have a clean heart help us that our thoughts would be clean if somebody has done something against us from my heart we say Lord we

is prayer foreign Lord we pray for your people all these petitions in the name of Jesus Christ Mighty powerful angels is written by your stripes we were all healed and all the people that are sick

boys [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] aren't you thankful tonight to come up and share his testimony [Music] it's a privilege just be nice can you feel me when I say that what is foreign I want to read the scripture real quick it's it's very it's it's exactly who I am in first Corinthians 15 10. [Music] and it says but by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I labored more abundantly than they are not I I don't know yo but the grace of God which was with me and there if I didn't say anything else I I that's more than enough last Wednesday I got electrocuted by 277 277 votes um we were we and I'm going to tell the story you contractors electricians let's see if you guys have just as hard of a time believing it as the master electrician there where I where I work so we were working um same thing I do I mean thousands and thousands of times before we're just troubleshooting a unit trying to figure out what was wrong with it was failing power somewhere we turned the breaker off and on several times Airmen working with me that day not trying to point no fingers but the power was left on and I was on my knees I was on my knees getting ready to put my hands in it that has guided me my whole life says Abraham stand up so I stand up yeah and that's when you hit me yes it threw me about 10 feet back and I felt like somebody just pushed me it's almost really hard I know 277 doesn't sound right I as I was there the Airmen started to flip out he didn't know what to do long story short he calls the Medics my chicken and everything seemed like it was okay the only thing that I had it was like a burning sensation that went from my hand all the way up to my shoulders the whole thing I just wanted to get home we had service that night and I kept telling myself if I could just get there he's the same yesterday today and I believe I'll be all right well I never got here it was a long night no feeling in my arm nothing yes stubborn as I am did not want to go see a doctor finally went to see the doctor long story short Caleb was praying here Sunday morning he felt he felt inspired to to pray for me that morning he says there where you're at just raise your hands and I did and uh the minute I raised my hands even before the prayer ended all the feelings just started to come back to my house so when I went back to work on Tuesday after electrician who wrote all the reports they're waiting for me and he says Abraham I I have some issues with what you're saying happened for 277 to hit you foreign keep sending jolts through you until it burns everything inside he started to go on about the laws of electricity and he started to tell me he says there's just no way you had to be kicked off a brand new Airman [Music] why in the world would you stand up he said your your vision towards the boxes is off since I was a young boy that protection of grace and mercy followed me everywhere and I started to tell the master electrician I sat here and told you all the times that the Lord has intervened infection has reached out to me and and changed my circumstances as I started to tell him he says you know you're not a religious man he says but I know there was something there with you just because I just can't make make any sense of what you're telling me that I had to question another Airmen the Airmen make sure that you weren't telling me a lie question but he says I have both the Airmen and your reports so this reminded me of a story of the Three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace I told him and I said in that fiery furnace as they begin to look upon that fiery furnace there was a Fourth Man In The Fire And I told him I said that Fourth Man was the one who good between me and death and I just wanted to share that with you I want to tell you that the same Lord God that was alive way back then he's producing the same exact works right here and I'm just so happy that I'm able to be here and give my testimony because according to all science to all everything that everybody looks at I should not be here right now and I want to thank the Lord for always intervening for me proving that he is in God bless you amen give one to the Lord and we stand to our feet let's sing
