[31:48] that the man would be taken away from
[31:51] the scene

[38:36] Christian amen amen
[38:40] Blessed Be Our Lord Jesus Christ
[38:44] let me tell you something
[38:47] there's a strategy that the devil has El
[38:50] Diablo Siempre the devil always
[38:55] the first thing that he does with the
[38:57] Christian is
[38:58] to Rob your joy
[39:03] because the devil knows
[39:07] that the that the life for the force is
[39:09] in the joy amen the strength
[39:14] Cristiano and the devil sees the
[39:16] Christian
[39:17] and he puts his foot on him amen
[39:27] and then he loses his side
[39:30] and he gets to church
[39:34] and he stays in church with a problem
[39:36] that was outside
[39:40] he loses it in the seat amen
[39:47] when we were coming crossing over here

[40:02] no
[40:04] and I said no no don't don't worry
[40:07] this is all that the devil has
[40:10] the devil wanted to take our job
[40:13] and get us all preoccupied
[40:18] because the Lord has something greater
[40:20] for us amen amen
[40:25] and if the Christian always does this
[40:28] like the scriptures
[40:31] Nothing Else Matters amen
[40:35] Nothing's Gonna Move Me amen
[40:39] I will finish my word my road with joy
[40:44] blessed be that Lord Jesus
[40:50] then we see that the devil is always
[40:53] trying to rob our Joy El Cristiano
[40:55] Christian
[40:57] should be strengthening himself amen
[41:00] amen
[41:03] in the physical
[41:07] when one wants to to strengthen himself
[41:17] and he puts on more weight
[41:21] not
[41:23] if there's no pain there is no gain
[41:27] amen amen
[41:31] or you wanna you wanna come to the
[41:33] church and keep on lifting five pounds
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:38] you got to lift more weight
[41:41] to be stronger
[41:44] the natural types of spiritual amen
[41:49] the Lord is preparing us for a war
[41:52] [Applause]
[41:53] and we have to be ready
[41:56] when the Christian is not strong
[42:00] then you're not going to go to church
[42:03] how come you're not going to go to
[42:04] church
[42:06] it's because the mosquito bit me
[42:22] it doesn't matter that there's problems
[42:26] if no one in the church wants to go
[42:28] I want to go
[42:32] if no one wants to sing
[42:34] then I will sing to the Lord
[42:37] no one wants to worship then I Will
[42:40] Worship the Lord
[42:42] odia
[42:45] Iglesia how come you didn't go to church
[42:48] because I fought with my wife
[42:56] and let the Lord fix you and your wife
[43:00] and then afterwards
[43:05] how come the church is so cold
[43:11] because we haven't resisted the trial
[43:14] amen
[43:23] here I believe there's brothers that
[43:25] have experience in the military or the
[43:27] Army

[43:30] Brothers amen amen
[43:33] they don't ask permission amen amen
[43:39] I need a volunteer amen amen
[43:44] and all the ones that are on the line
[43:46] they take a step forward
[43:48] and they said I'll do it
[43:51] Iglesia and this is sometimes in the
[43:54] church
[43:55] we need volunteers
[44:01] and then they start to look this person
[44:04] or that person is
[44:09] we're in a spiritual war amen amen
[44:13] we need to resist
[44:16] the training is hard man Amen
[44:21] brother Branham says that he had a
[44:23] trainer
[44:25] and the trainer would hit him very hard
[44:32] and brother Brown would tell the trainer
[44:34] you don't have to be so hard Billy
[44:39] cuando Tu Estes and he told him Billy
[44:42] when you're there in the boxing ring
[44:44] you're gonna thank me amen
[44:48] because there's going to be times
[44:51] that you're going to be by yourself
[44:54] and you have to resist
[45:11] it's better that you lose because your
[45:14] opponent is that much better than you
[45:17] that then if you lose because you got
[45:19] tired
[45:23] cancer
[45:25] I can take it there's people that get
[45:27] tired
[45:28] because they don't have the strength
[45:31] the devil stole their Joy amen amen
[45:36] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:38] Christ
[45:40] in the Bible
[45:43] there's a story that we all know
[45:46] the story of Samson
[45:51] chapter 16 in the Book of Judges
[45:57] we all know that Samson was a strong man
[46:01] killed thousands of men men
[46:05] he tore the doors off the Philistines
[46:09] and many things that the Bible says
[46:16] the example of Samson is for us
[46:19] Sansone
[46:23] Samson means like the sun
[46:29] and he married a woman
[46:33] named Delilah
[46:36] that means weakness
[46:40] a tremendous
[46:43] is something strong
[46:48] when the sun is at its highest point its
[46:51] strongest point
[46:52] you can't look at it if you look at it
[46:57] and you stay looking at it you'll go
[46:59] blind
[47:10] and there's there's many examples
[47:14] for teachings uh
[47:16] Cristiano
[47:20] how come a Believer can't marry an
[47:23] unbeliever itambien
[47:36] that are going to take them and pull
[47:38] them into the world amen amen
[47:43] and if someone says I mean
[47:46] that won't happen to me
[47:49] rather be careful
[47:55] in the few minutes that I have left
[47:58] I want to share something with you uh
[48:03] I'm not behind the pulpit
[48:06] because I'm someone
[48:09] or because I deserve it
[48:14] only because of the grace of God
[48:19] when I was younger or
[48:22] um
[48:24] or I'm going to say it like this I had
[48:27] the privilege
[48:31] to to grow up and be born in a in a
[48:33] Christian Church
[48:35] yes
[48:37] and that Christian Church was of the
[48:39] message
[48:47] in Mexico
[48:48] one of the churches
[48:51] Pioneer churches uh there in Mexico
[48:56] I I grew up
[49:01] and I grew up to be the president of the
[49:04] young people there in in Juarez
[49:09] and I'm going to say this with a lot of
[49:11] Shame
[49:13] I'm very ashamed of this
[49:17] and I share it
[49:20] because I I believe that it will will
[49:23] help somebody
[49:24] foreign
[49:27] I believe that that was all there was
[49:30] but I I lacked something
[49:34] I I lack being born again
[49:39] I lacked death
[49:44] I I hadn't died
[49:48] the Bible says
[49:55] fool don't you know that if the seed
[49:58] doesn't fall into the ground and die
[50:00] Sola queda
[50:02] it abideth alone
[50:07] it brings forth much fruit
[50:10] and those is
[50:12] then I I I didn't die
[50:17] and I started problems in the church
[50:22] and as a young person
[50:27] I started to lose my strength
[50:32] I started to lose my joy amen amen
[50:39] you know how things start in the church
[50:43] and and a lot of people are affected by
[50:46] it
[50:47] and I was not strong
[50:49] this is
[50:51] the scripture says in Psalm 16 and
[50:54] supresencia in his in his presence
[50:58] there's fullness of joy
[51:03] but when you leave his presence
[51:07] you start to lose Joy amen amen
[51:12] and that happened to me
[51:16] I started to lose the joy
[51:19] Iglesia and I would come to church
[51:24] and I didn't feel anything in my heart
[51:32] and I started moving one seat back
[51:35] and one more back
[51:39] until I got all the way to the chair
[51:42] there's right by the exit door in the
[51:44] regret and one day I didn't come back
[51:50] the Bible teaches us with Samson
[51:53] a
[51:55] es
[51:57] that he revealed to Delilah
[52:01] The Secret of his strength
[52:06] and when she knew the secret of his
[52:09] strength
[52:10] she cut his hair
[52:12] she cut his Joy Le cortos she cut his
[52:16] strength
[52:18] right amen
[52:20] says and then the enemy
[52:24] took control
[52:27] s
[52:29] they took out his eyes
[52:33] and they had them in Chains
[52:38] when the devil imprisoned me
[52:43] he took my strength
[52:50] Olo sojos he took my eyes
[52:53] I couldn't see him
[52:56] I couldn't see his miracles
[53:01] and he put me in Chains
[53:08] that's a terrible situation Brothers
[53:13] and I feel ashamed
[53:16] pero esto is
[53:21] but this is so that my life and my
[53:24] experience can be a footstep to you
[53:28] amen amen
[53:31] and that you can grow
[53:34] the Lord and his grace
[53:38] one one day remembered me
[53:41] you know something Brothers morir
[53:44] death
[53:45] is
[53:48] something that that's going to happen
[53:50] when you're alone
[53:55] it's an event where you alone are gonna
[53:58] die
[54:00] if you tell the brother
[54:02] we're going to go to the movie
[54:04] and I said yes we're going to go
[54:07] you say we're gonna go to football yes
[54:10] we're going to go
[54:12] but if you say brother let's go die
[54:16] all right
[54:17] now
[54:20] you're gonna die alone
[54:24] the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:27] even his own disciples
[54:29] they didn't stay with him amen
[54:33] and he was alone
[54:36] even one that said Lord I'll follow you
[54:41] denied him three times amen amen
[54:46] it's a it's a process it's an alone it's
[54:50] a lonely process
[54:52] and when you're there
[54:57] I remember that the Lord remembered me
[55:01] and I was totally alone uh
[55:07] I was in a hotel room
[55:10] far from home far from
[55:15] Mom and Dad
[55:30] for 10 years I left the church
[55:33] e
[55:35] is
[55:40] all the time that I would would leave on
[55:42] a trip I
[55:44] would prepare my suitcase
[55:47] Madre and my mom
[55:49] at night
[55:52] she would get my Bible
[55:55] and she'd put it in my suitcase
[56:03] and every time I would get to my
[56:05] destination
[56:06] I'd open my suitcase and I would see my
[56:10] Bible
[56:12] but I didn't open it
[56:16] for 10 years
[56:19] until one day the Lord
[56:22] touched my heart Heal Me knocked on my
[56:25] heart
[56:27] and I didn't know yesterday
[56:31] until one day I said Lord what is it
[56:34] that you want
[56:37] and I went and I knew the Bible was in
[56:40] the suitcase
[56:41] and I went and I took it out
[56:47] and I started flipping through it and I
[56:49] said Lord what is it that you want from
[56:51] me
[56:55] and in the middle of the Bible
[56:59] I found a letter
[57:02] and it was a letter
[57:06] that had been written by my mother
[57:10] the Holy Spirit
[57:13] inspired my mom
[57:17] to give me the message that I needed
[57:22] that message stayed for 10 years in my
[57:24] Bible
[57:26] but the day that I read it
[57:29] it did it did something in my heart
[57:34] and I and I couldn't go no more
[57:37] I was very far from home
[57:41] Australia I was in Melbourne Australia
[57:44] papa no no father no Mama no mother no
[57:48] Nadia nobody
[57:51] I was completely by myself
[57:54] and there I began to cry like I'd never
[57:57] cried before
[57:59] and the Lord forgave me
[58:02] and I said Lord
[58:10] one more chance
[58:17] Lord all I ask is that you let me come
[58:19] into the last last few
[58:21] and let me just hear
[58:24] and the grace of God
[58:27] was so abundant over me
[58:37] Lord continues to forgive sins
[58:41] I didn't know what Grace was
[58:44] I didn't do anything
[58:46] God did everything and he loved me
[58:57] brother when the troubles come no
[58:59] permitas
[59:01] don't permit your joy to be taken
[59:04] foreign
[59:06] because when you make a mistake
[59:09] you feel like you're you're like your
[59:12] strength is taken
[59:14] you feel like your joy is here but
[59:17] that's why David would say
[59:20] return unto me the joy of yourself of my
[59:23] salvation
[59:25] if someone needs Joy
[59:28] the Lord can bring it back to you
[59:32] but you have to enter into his book
[59:35] because in his presence
[59:39] there is a completeness and a fullness
[59:41] of joy
[59:43] God bless you brother
[1:00:13] foreign
[1:01:07] and
[1:01:12] as you open to your Bibles
[1:01:18] I want to thank uh or my brother and our
[1:01:21] my friend brother Caleb foreign
[1:01:25] for this opportunity that he gives me to
[1:01:27] be here in this place is
[1:01:33] [Music]
[1:01:35] I'm happy to see each and every one of
[1:01:37] you
[1:01:40] some that I've known for many years
[1:01:51] the Bible says here in Saint John 3
[1:01:54] Verse 6 carne
[1:01:58] carne is that which is born of the flesh
[1:02:01] is flesh
[1:02:06] and that which is born of the spirit is
[1:02:09] Spirit
[1:02:12] do we see two things there is
[1:02:20] we heard a few moments ago
[1:02:24] how that each and every one of us
[1:02:29] that when we come to the presence of God
[1:02:35] we have to have a beginning and an after
[1:02:39] and the the phrase I died
[1:02:47] it is written in in past time
[1:02:54] it marks a beginning at the end in time
[1:03:58] in Romans
[1:04:39] because clearly at the end of the verse
[1:04:44] because sin dwelleth in me yes
[1:04:51] in Psalms 51.
[1:04:55] my mother conceived me
[1:04:58] and in and wickedness
[1:05:04] now and that is the reason why I have to
[1:05:07] get closer to that death
[1:05:10] First Corinthians 15.
[1:05:14] Bible Purity says
[1:05:16] flesh and blood
[1:05:19] does not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:05:25] in Galatians
[1:05:29] says that flesh and blood is
[1:05:33] something that is contrary to the spirit
[1:05:37] and we heard it a few moments
[1:05:44] we are in a fight
[1:05:46] but the fight isn't with the brothers
[1:05:55] because the flesh yeah
[1:06:02] every day
[1:06:04] there is
[1:06:16] something has to die
[1:06:39] that is
[1:06:47] something very important
[1:06:50] it doesn't take the filter the flesh
[1:06:54] that filthiness is still there it's
[1:07:05] until
[1:07:08] you want them to be there
[1:07:12] nobody else is going to to uh take him
[1:07:14] away from you
[1:07:17] the the Lord Jesus Christ told Nicodemus
[1:07:22] you have to be born again born again
[1:07:27] you must be born again
[1:07:29] it's not going to be giveness you have
[1:07:33] to do it
[1:07:34] [Music]
[1:07:35] I want to show here a picture
[1:07:39] this picture here Lois
[1:07:45] Drew this with this pen is
[1:07:50] on the Whiteboard
[1:07:53] and he drew two human hearts
[1:07:57] you know possibly you've seen it for a
[1:08:00] long time
[1:08:01] but in one heart
[1:08:03] he drew a serpent
[1:08:06] it is the same thing that the Apostle
[1:08:08] Paul and that serpent Vida is
[1:08:13] his his life is there there it is his
[1:08:17] habitations oh and he's very comfortable
[1:08:20] oh he's very happy
[1:08:22] because he has a very delicious
[1:08:25] the person
[1:08:35] technology
[1:08:44] it's very comfortable it's
[1:08:49] growing
[1:08:52] oh it's feeding itself on delicious
[1:08:54] things
[1:08:57] but here there is also another house and
[1:09:01] this one here is
[1:09:08] one of those two conditions
[1:09:14] let us analyze ourselves
[1:09:18] because our brother said
[1:09:20] is
[1:09:22] the first thing
[1:09:25] and the joy is of course it's
[1:09:30] it's
[1:09:32] something that's pulling you to go
[1:09:34] forward
[1:09:35] and that is the first thing that the
[1:09:37] devil wants to remove
[1:09:40] the first thing he wants to remove from
[1:09:42] you and I is
[1:09:56] happening
[1:09:58] and where did you begin to build the
[1:10:01] paganism
[1:10:06] because the Apostle Paul says
[1:10:09] that I want to do good they don't know
[1:10:11] but I can't
[1:10:14] because this flesh does it per minute
[1:10:17] so then what must I do
[1:10:20] it's time to take out the story
[1:10:22] and begin to kill
[1:10:25] to begin to annihilate oh it is
[1:10:30] you
[1:10:43] can you believe it
[1:10:47] and here it is
[1:10:51] here he's got a life
[1:10:53] and he's very happy
[1:10:56] you think he's going to want to come out
[1:11:00] Romans chapter 8 says foreign
[1:11:16] or to be carnally minded as death but to
[1:11:19] be spiritually minded is life and peace
[1:11:29] because
[1:11:31] the current because the carnal mind is
[1:11:34] enmity against God for it is not subject
[1:11:36] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[1:11:50] Who Wants to Be an enemy of God
[1:11:55] raise your hand
[1:11:57] Who Wants to Be an enemy of God
[1:12:02] but I want to raise my hand
[1:12:04] because I want to be a friend of God you
[1:12:07] want to be a friend of God no there is
[1:12:12] what is born of the flesh is
[1:12:20] the there is the desire of the flesh
[1:12:23] the desire of the flesh is the enmity
[1:12:25] against God so then what must I do think
[1:12:29] okay
[1:12:30] I have to eliminate someone
[1:12:34] has to be eliminated
[1:12:36] you can't have both together
[1:12:39] I gotta take out the sword
[1:12:41] and begin to eliminate
[1:12:50] that this is something easy
[1:12:52] the first thing that happened
[1:12:54] that the heart stops
[1:12:57] it starts
[1:13:00] the blood stops circulating circulation
[1:13:04] without the circulation of blood
[1:13:08] the body the temperature begins
[1:13:13] so then the body has no longer has a
[1:13:16] temperature
[1:13:17] the skin begins to change
[1:13:20] he
[1:13:53] [Applause]
[1:14:07] his muscles began to get stood these
[1:14:09] muscles began to get stiff
[1:14:11] what happened brother
[1:14:13] oh you were walking fine
[1:14:16] you were the one that would invite me
[1:14:18] now what's going on
[1:14:21] who impregnated
[1:14:23] you were walking fine
[1:14:26] but now something happened to you
[1:14:29] you begin to hear
[1:14:32] things you shouldn't have been hearing
[1:14:35] you begin
[1:14:37] you begin to leave
[1:14:45] you begin to you were converted
[1:14:48] you were converted to a prize of Satan
[1:14:51] you're pale Frio called doodle hard
[1:14:56] stiff
[1:14:59] what needs to happen
[1:15:06] Colossians 3 5.
[1:15:10] I said
[1:15:18] Cinco
[1:15:22] can you put on the screen here
[1:15:24] foreign
[1:15:34] Therefore your members which are upon
[1:15:36] the Earth
[1:15:37] fornication uncleanness
[1:15:43] coma
[1:15:45] comma
[1:15:46] uh
[1:15:50] uh uh appeared means to stop
[1:15:56] it means a space
[1:15:59] it's so that you can reflect on it
[1:16:02] what has to die in me
[1:16:05] sometimes it has to be me
[1:16:09] I wanna I want the Flesh in him today
[1:16:14] but I have to have the the flesh to die
[1:16:17] in me
[1:16:18] that
[1:16:21] was my example
[1:16:23] he can see a greater light
[1:16:29] you can see a change
[1:16:31] not with words
[1:16:37] because words
[1:16:40] this world is is tired of words
[1:16:43] it is tired of words
[1:17:14] the question is how are you going to
[1:17:17] kill it
[1:17:22] when you have a mascot
[1:17:27] the first thing that you must do
[1:17:31] you're going to kill him the way the
[1:17:33] kill the the matter do you want them too
[1:17:37] there's going to be some resistance
[1:17:40] if you stop giving them food
[1:17:44] if you were to uh if you were feeding
[1:17:47] them with a lot of social media
[1:17:50] however you are feeding him
[1:17:53] only you and God knows nobody else
[1:17:58] because who knows
[1:18:10] I can't even see my wife
[1:18:20] so then I had to analyze how am I going
[1:18:23] to kill him
[1:18:24] I have to
[1:18:37] [Applause]
[1:19:13] [Applause]
[1:19:23] the prophet says
[1:19:34] [Applause]
[1:19:57] [Applause]
[1:19:59] seven times
[1:20:06] Padre
[1:20:27] which father is
[1:20:30] his children walk is
[1:20:36] it again
[1:21:07] what is it that you want in your life
[1:21:11] Castle
[1:21:14] this is
[1:21:16] Brother Branham says the prophet says in
[1:21:18] the uh let us escaping from pressure
[1:21:21] betting off the pressure
[1:21:24] we died
[1:21:26] yo Mori I died
[1:21:30] I was buried
[1:21:32] and it's not something that is easy
[1:21:38] but that's right there is where you
[1:21:40] separate the spirit
[1:21:42] the flesh gets buried
[1:21:44] no we no longer have the desires
[1:21:48] but now we must resurrect in the spirit
[1:21:52] and the spirit gives life pass peace
[1:21:59] these things there's no law against them
[1:22:02] now let me tell you
[1:22:05] another thing that death does
[1:22:08] it takes you a lot of time
[1:23:10] but it's got no more strength foreign
[1:23:44] Glory man Hallelujah
[1:23:52] evidence
[1:23:58] in Hebrews chapter 5 preached in
[1:24:00] September
[1:24:02] December 8 1957.
[1:24:07] when that changed which is called a New
[1:24:09] Birth has happened
[1:24:12] you don't have to do nothing to prove it
[1:24:16] your life is going to prove it
[1:24:19] the the way the way that you walk
[1:24:24] love is following you
[1:24:27] the peace is
[1:24:29] oh did you see the brother I don't know
[1:24:32] what's the matter with them I don't know
[1:24:34] what's going on with them
[1:24:36] but there's something
[1:24:38] I love to be with him
[1:24:41] oh there's such a piece
[1:24:43] oh there's a real love
[1:24:47] in trabajo
[1:24:50] use not without work nothing yeah
[1:24:53] it's not that he doesn't have a job
[1:24:57] I thought he had a lot of problems
[1:24:59] what's going on with him oh he should be
[1:25:02] down on the ground
[1:25:04] why is he even singing we're killing
[1:25:07] because he has found contrados
[1:25:15] he has found that line
[1:25:17] that happens to the human being
[1:25:20] that he has he has never lost foreign
[1:25:49] foreign
[1:26:38] but he chose the correct decision
[1:26:42] that your will be done
[1:26:47] oh what a crucial hour
[1:26:54] even to the point where the blood and
[1:26:56] the water separated
[1:26:59] he died more in Gethsemane than on the
[1:27:03] cross
[1:27:04] and here he is standing against
[1:27:07] with this great suffering
[1:27:10] the the sin of every person
[1:27:17] that one time he should die
[1:27:20] the innocent
[1:27:22] the innocent had to become sinful sin
[1:27:54] the gifts I returned to him
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:48] how many years ago can you say you died
[1:28:55] the
[1:28:58] most shameful for me for me
[1:29:02] that I haven't died yesterday and that I
[1:29:06] am still well
[1:29:07] with the with the desires
[1:29:13] and I want to say this and I'm gonna
[1:29:15] finish
[1:29:16] this small church
[1:29:19] this small bride
[1:29:23] if she can only see Justin
[1:29:26] beyond the turn of time
[1:29:29] where there's no Affliction
[1:29:32] you want to change it for nothing
[1:29:36] exchange it for nothing of this world
[1:29:40] this world
[1:29:44] This World
[1:29:53] the Flesh that is
[1:31:00] it's an experience
[1:31:17] I want to be in that condition
[1:31:20] and joy begins to return
[1:31:24] it'll be about your head
[1:31:26] let us pray
[1:31:32] we're going to turn the service over

[1:31:48] Comfort is
[1:31:50] here to liberate
[1:31:52] it's here to forgive
[1:31:55] he doesn't look at how you come
[1:31:58] whatever you did you did it
[1:32:00] but that was the last time
[1:32:04] make a commitment
[1:32:06] and tell him I died
