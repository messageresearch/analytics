[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning do I have this on do I have a switch on can you hear me back there it's okay okay all right just making sure thank you Patrick good morning ber good that's a rough way to say good morning huh good morning amen sometime just to awake people good morning certainly a privilege to be here in Colorado and always good to be with friends and especially my good friend and he's like my son brother Chris I sure do love him and his wife and his children amen Don't Leave Nobody out God bless you it's good to see brother Diego amen and every one of you God bless you I believe we have Albuquerque in telephone hookup and also Las Cruses so let's all say God bless youer God bless you amen last uh Wednesday I preached my second message on election and we had Las crues on Telephone hookup amen very very tremendous messages not preaching the message it's uh I started maybe month and a half ago in fact I was in Lake Tahoe California cnia when the inspiration came to me and it's quite a subject amen so not to take more time and go right into the word if you w would open your Bibles to The Second Epistle of John chapter one and verse [Music] one children it's always good to see William of course when I was in Lake Taho I remembered William because William is from that area from I've always said this I do not like cities but if I was to live in City the first place I would pick would be San Diego California and the second one Sacramento California Sacramento is a very beautiful city do you know that the city of Sacramento has more trees than any other city except for one place in the world and now that I discovered Lake Taho Sacramento just doubled and in my take over first place with San Diego if you ever have a chance go toake it's a freshwater lake and it's it's quite a sight to see it's so beautiful there you I think I think that's the closest thing to the Millennium they tell me Hawaii is pretty people go to Alaska they say it's very nice I'll tell you Hawaii has has something to prove to to be as pretty as Lake Taho well brother P you've never been to Hawaii if going four times isn't going then I haven't been there it's pretty but not as pretty as lakeo so my wife wants me to take her to Lake or to Hawaii I guess one one of these days I'll take her but I tell her I I told her I've taken you to a much prettier Place amen anyway enough of that nonsense okay second John chapter 1 verse one it reads this way the children unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and not I only but also all they that have known the truth may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated sometimes when we read the Bible and we are surrounded by different churches everybody wants to be a possessor of this and if you read the Bible correctly this Bible is not addressed to unbelievers that's why it said to all those that love the truth and clearly it says the Elder unto the elect nobody else nobody else to this letter is to the elect lady and to her children so right away I don't think people have any business reading my letters do you know it's it's bad to read somebody's open somebody's letter so if you're not elect you don't have a right to read these letter it's unto the elect lady and her children now I don't know which way I'm going I just wait for God but maybe I'll start this way I have more nose and Carter's got pills but I'll read a few and then we'll see what God has for us but one of the the the things that I want to start with is concerning the church and the bright there's a lot a lot of difference between the church and the there are scriptures that go to the church but there are scriptures that go only to the bright even brother Bram on the S says I'm going to call you bride so then it's to the elect lady and and and in reality no one is going to understand this Bible no matter no matter if you memorize it you will not understand it unless it's directed to you that much I know all right when when we speak of the church many people are confused theologians are confused and they they this friend of brother brandham did not agree with Brother brandham on his approach to the church brother Bram said he he he does not agree with me and that's fine he said he's still my brother he says but I do not agree with him either so then two can't walk together L they agree now he says this he sees that the church has to go through the tribulation period for purification I say the blood of Jesus Christ purifies the church I believe that the church goes through the tribulation period Church organization but the bride does not would you choose a woman you had to purify before you married her Christ Christ bride is chosen and she is elected she's God's bride the Bride of Jesus Christ so that settles that for me it settles it the only thing it does it opens a lot of questions concerning the new birth concerning many things and I see God I see him well I know I know you got scripture to kind of counter me on this that's fine contradict me all you want but I also have a right to voice what I see since a child life I've wondered many things and since being as a minister or a pastor that's been 40 years now uh I've always had questions when I hear preachers preach not all preachers but some preachers and they make statements like like uh because of the fighting of Israel in Lebanon the end is almost here and I don't accept that and I'm going to tell you why I don't accept it I am 65 years old ever since I've been in church it's been the end time it's doomsday preachers well uh I'm I'm going to I'm going to go back I I have to say this to get to elect a man comes to me with a m message and it's concerning that Los Angeles was going to S this was last year in September of last year and uh he asked me that he would that if I gave him permission to I said sure s he couldn't get him then he asked me the question do you believe that what these scientist said that in September I don't forget what date Los Angeles is GNA sink I didn't have to think about it I didn't have to pray about it I didn't have to meditate about it I said absolutely not Los Angeles ain't ready to sing and I'll tell you I'll tell you why we there are still succession of events that need to happen before that event takes place then somebody asked me well do you have for knowledge I said well what do you think I'm speaking to you now then he said what only God God has for knowledge I said yes God had for knowledge everything that God was he poured it into the church or he poured it into Christ and everything that christed into the church then show me where the foral is that's why a lot of people are going to they don't know what's going on I said as far as the end time we have been in the end time for many years we even preach the end time message that's why I did not accept what that preacher had to say I will not accept it unless it's Bible truth and I have a for knowledge of it so so the thing goes on and on and on with preachers that's why preacher should have a pastor by yourself you ain't going to do it you see that everything that Christ was he poured it into the church now where's the church well I am part of that church I'm elected I'm chosen I'm predestined to be there that's God's predestination so what does predestination do it looks to for knowledge because predestined means to foree so it points to forn knowledge and then that points to Destiny you mean there's Destiny for all of us sure is you're here today you know where you're going to be tomorrow somebody asked me well that means that you can do anything I said absolutely I can do anything that I want in fact I'm in Colorado Springs this morning because I to I preach because I want I read the word of God because I want to that's why I do it I want to do it amen amen all right you're with me elect for knowledge looks predestination do you believe there's a lot of people going to be saved and the answer would be yes are you saved brother pis yes I will not be saved I am saved when were you saved Brother P I'll tell you when I was saved I was wasn't saved when I got baptized or I went through all these rituals in church I wasn't saved then then when were you saved I was saved and I became a Christian let me read something to you here put on your jackets get your helmets ready this will turn you around for the children being not yet born this is Esau and Jacob neither having done good or evil that the purpose of God according to the election Esau and Jacob before either child was born before they even knew what was right and wrong that the election of God might stand not of works but of him that call brother Brown says I thought you quit in meat to get saved you have nothing to do with it if you're saved God called you listen God called you before the foundation of the world that's the problem to much religion Shepherds telling you that you got to do this or that don't have to do nothing not what we do what God orain that's all there is doing there's nothing we can do about it some guy said I like to smoke religious person will tell him no don't smoke I don't tell them enjoy it yeah that's what they enjoy enjoy I like to drink beer religious Shepherds say no it's wrong to drink beer not if he likes it let him have it let him let him let him enjoy it that's what he likes it's like I told you I do what I want why because that's what I want to do nobody going to tell me what to do my nature speaks for itself I preach cuz I want to preach I sing him cuz I want to sing him I do all these things because it's my nature to do then you when you were saved since you were saved brother pis since I recognized that I was elected I left all religion behind me I don't need religion all I need to know is that God elected me yeah elected GL brother pis you don't know if you're elected speak for yourself don't interpret the word to me it's already been interpreted already come to pass I'm elected I don't have to prove nothing to nobody I don't even have to prove it to God I don't have to prove to God nothing he elected me that's all there is do it can you understand that you are elected I was thinking as you open your Bibles to St Matthew the third chapter I was thinking on this scripture and it's Matthew 3 and it says this 10 now also the ex is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is heun down and cast Into the Fire I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire just for a minute catch your attention can you imagine can you imagine if you were John and you already had for knowledge of this one that was coming and when he's baptizing he sees Jesus he knew who Jesus was and what was his reaction he said no way am I going to baptize him he's mightier than I there's no way I'll baptize what did Jesus say to him suffer Johnn for it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness right amen he didn't want to baptize him he knew he was mighty he knew that that he was a Son of God and he was not worthy to baptizing until Jesus used the words it becometh us now you don't don't miss the word us now I'm going to read I'm going to read from Brother Bram often times I've have wondered why the Jesus of Nazareth and many times he's been asked me why would a man like Jesus have to be baptized why would this person be baptized as an act of repentance and of confession when he was the Holy spest unadulterated son of the Living God why would this person have to be baptized like a man coming and he why would he have to be baptized like he had unto repentance because he needed no repentance he was the infallable god he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not did you notice the phrase before that said thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness in other words it must be fulfilled all the word that God has spoken pay attention because it's it has a real awesome point there all the word that God has spoken it must be fulfilled God cannot say anything without having it fulfilled when he was spoken it it is a finished work it's already finished when God speaks it God never speaks it until he's ready for it to be and when he speaks it's just as well as already happened if that would wouldn't give us basis to put our faith on the this morning when God speaks a word it's already finished what about his promises that he's given to us see everything that he has said it's already a finished work so therefore when we receive this word into our heart it's already done it's completed here I'm going to get a little heavy amen natural birth spiritual birth we know we were born of corruptible seed but when you were born I'm going to ask you a question why and I'm going to quote brother randam as saying the physical birth or the Virgin birth is more mysterious than the the spiritual birth I never understood that but by God's grace I do now but I I always wondered here's God or not God Elohim Elohim now he was by himself when all of a sudden he had thoughts which we would call an attribute there are thoughts they're not words there are thoughts and when he had these thoughts he had to have thought of you let me tell you one thing if he didn't have you in his thought you ain't going nowhere you have to have been in his thoughts now in his thoughts he knew that he had to be a savior so then in his thoughts he crucified the Lord Jesus Christ and he knew at what time we were going to be born in the first age or the last age he knew this he didn't just think of Jesus Christ he had lot of thoughts and to express them he couldn't do it unless he had the right people to deposit these thoughts in so then when you were conceived in your mother's womb where were you you were in your mother also I am speaking about the real you but it was J you could not touch it nobody could handle it you couldn't touch that it was hidden by God it's what is called the hidden man of the heart but it was in your mother that's why Nicodemus said is it possible that I can go back into my mother's womb no he couldn't go back into his mother's wom he was already expressed but he was in his heart and God had it there God wasn't going to bring it out until it was time in the fullness of time out of a woman God would bring this out and then would become the spiritual the spiritual birth couldn't come time message came when we heard that something happened to us it was not physical it was spiritual it was inside of us there was a germ there and the had to find its way to the and that's what where we find iine that's mine salvation is it yours will you have to claim it as I I has a personal pronoun is a name I tomasz have been born amen amen this seed is not corruptible it's Incorruptible seed nothing could bring it out except except the spoken word of God let me read it to you again when God speaks it God never speaks it until he's ready for it to be and when he speaks it's just as well as already happened when he speaks it it's there it happens nothing's going to stop it cuz God spoke it when God spoke his word to the Virgin Mary then Jesus came now let me stop for a minute was Jesus the holy incarnate God what brother said he was well then let me ask you a question and who are you stop for a minute now Jesus came and he had to come first but he wasn't the only one that God thought of or what Elohim thought of but he was the one that had to come first what for to pay the price so that Sinners could be saved amen then why so many different in churches because of man-made ideas amen I have a hard time with ministers you know that I'm very I have more trouble with ministers than I have anybody else because they think they know everything and they really the majority don't know nothing they have big words but I like a man that knows what he's talking about that's why I love brother Bernie Garcia he don't just talk he knows what he's talking about I just had supper with him two days ago I was in Mexico W with him a week before that I was in Rosarito with him and what services we had but here's the thing that when God speaks it he can't speak it in other words Jesus Christ paid the price right amen sure he did when when Jesus Christ paid the price I became available yes I became manifested there was nothing I had to do I didn't have to get baptized I didn't have to be Sanctified why should I why did I need sanctification when the blood of Jesus sanctifies me when when the penalty for sin was paid he paid it for me so then why did I need these things I didn't need them but since he told me look Thomas it becometh us that's all it is it's not it's not the you have to do it you are you are Sanctified in me you are saved in me I I was saved when I got baptized no sir I wasn't I was saved before the foundation of the world when he elected me now insert yourself there when he elected me nothing I had to do before the children were born he knew you before they did any good or evil he knew that and he chose them and he told them say to them I love you and to the other one I hate you you know why God never had them in his thoughts and if somebody hasn't been in the thoughts of God they won't be there see all that God has is for us because it is really God God God With Us God in us so then if it's God in us who are we a part of what is called God now you tell me that Jesus Christ is the object of worship he is not God is the object of wor it has to be I me and mine possessive action that's why people like if you go to job and and job said if I knew where he live I'd go and knock at his door one man is not God it takes the whole everything that God want when he pour into the church what did he pour into the church he pointed he P the nominative or the person that are nominated for office amen that's why I orain you to be a prophet that's why Paul said Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and if you don't recognize your office I feel sorry for you because you don't have it you might think you have it you don't have it because it's an office and that's what God F was the office I've heard preachers that don't know what they're talking about they say well I respect his office but I don't respect the man you don't respect the man the man is what makes the office how can you not respect that man man I can say to you an apostle of Jesus Christ what am I telling you that I am an apostle now let me do the work of an apostle you know how many churches and missions I have I have over 100 Missions and I have churches in the last week i' I've had 15 come come into my leadership it's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost feels he feels it he he is not upon everybody not upon All Flesh but upon the elected lady the elected lady she's the one that has the jeans of God nobody else no church person office it's God in the person God in the person so the person walks where are you his thoughts his thoughts are with God God is with him he's a very nervous person if you don't think I'm nervous talk to my wife very very nervous I don't know tomorrow where I'm going to be preaching I know I know I have to go to Africa I have to go to South America I have to go back into Mexico and then missions here in the United States you don't know sometimes the only thing that keeps me in sanity is that the nature of God I know that God needs me to go to these places now who do I preach to to the elected lady and to the sav church because there's many people that are not going to be in the bright but they will be saved that's the same church but they're not going to be saved unless they hear the message of the king the end time message by the elected lady there's people that's all they want to do today is take they don't need leadership they don't know what they're talking about the devil has this receiv their minds because everybody has to hear the message now do I have to hear I've already heard it there's nothing you can tell me that I don't know you know why I know it because God is in me I have for knowledge my predestination I I know my Destin I know where I come from I also know where I'm going that's my reward but I have to go out to the people I feel sorry for people everywhere I go trying to make it with religion they asked me do you have religion I said I sure do the blood of Jesus that's my religion nothing else nothing more I don't care what anybody tells me I know who I am I know where I come from I know where I'm going I go to places people surround me they said brother pis are you going to minister I said no my sons are I they say but I but we want to hear you brother P I said you will when you hear my son they're good and they're the best amen amen so that's the way it is so then if I do something it's because it becometh me and Jesus to fulfill that amen you you understand it has nothing to do with religion this will scare the scarecrows birds away and everything this scarecrow it's not that the beautiful thing is that he knew just say it to yourself he knew how he loved me can you comprehend how much he loved you and and see what a bunch of gripers we are always griping about this when I was I don't know where I was but as I was meditating on Election I thought I thought of a word that comes to me and the Word was depression and I began to look into depression and I looked of course I looked it up in the dictionary it says the state or feeling of being depressed in spirit not in physical when you when you're depressed it's not a physical problem it is spiritual problem you you you've seen because had depressed my wife many times she says aren't you feeling good I said I feel all right well you look sad you look depressed I said I am far from being depressed what is it is that when I meditate on him I I look sad is that I'm thinking about him or maybe I am getting a message from him he says brother pis you get messages from God what do you think you're you're hearing this is a message from God that God gave to me to bring it to you so then when you find a person depressed in spirit it means he has a lost state of strength or energy a period of subnormal economic activity as I wrote that down in my notes I wrote many other things in my notes which I numbered or letter from a to I think and I and I and I and I go through them because I just performed a 50th wedding anniversary and I I made a statement which maybe didn't go good with a lot of people but I I asked I asked the lady I said you've been married to this guy for 50 years she said yes I said now is your chance you're free to go and then and then maybe a religious guy would this say well how would he say that I just took it from the scriptures everything that was in bondage was set free it said everything that was in bondage when the trumpet sounded to sound the Jubilee be set free but if they didn't want to go they would Mark him is that right and she said no I would never leave him I said well then they'll never complain because you had a second chance I said many couples never get to 50 I never got to 50 with my first wife she was 32 years old when she died right now we' have been married 43 years but I I began to think on depression and I think my wife shared this with me that she got from the internet but she told me that 60% of the people that reach the age of 60 are depressed so you know the people that are depressed they usually have to give him some kind of pills amen amen amen but you know what is it a crime to be depressed our Spirits are low so then I begin to think what is it that keeps us going I mean there has to be an energy field somewhere to keep us from being depressed do you know why so many people take drugs cuz they're depressed and it gives them a highight yes they they they feel good so when the drugs starts woring up they have to take more drugs to come up again is any difference taking those drugs than going to a drug store and taking what they call illegal drug it's the same thing but why is it that people cannot find and escape from this because they're treating it physically it's not a physical problem it's a spiritual problem something's going on inside of you something maybe God is trying to move inside of you and you fight that best thing to do stand still take just heed to God see what God has for you and then act on what he says because if you don't act on it you're not going to be liberated what you want is Liberation deed do you think having having money will take you a depression money has nothing to do with depression it has to do with it when that's all you think about is money money money be content with what you have give God thanks for what you have give him honor and Glory it's not what you have it's who has you if if God has got a hold of you recognize it that when something's happening inside of you something spiritual it is not physical it is God trying to tell you something stop and listen no matter how much your body wants to move make it sit down be subject by that would stop a lot of people from doing a lot of things they do this depression 60% of the people over 60 years old are depressed so you that are in your 50s watch it but some of you already got a head start on it so some of you amen is depression amen is that pretty that's election when when God elects you when you recognize it like I said a while ago who elected us the church no it's not the church it's God when did he elect us before the foundation of the world who is the only man that knew he was elected that was Jesus Christ how come we didn't know because our minds were darkened we couldn't understand it something had to happen for us to get to the place that Jesus Christ is why do you think we see in heaven Christ Jesus we not everybody sits there but when you recognize who your Savor is Lord is you sit in Heavenly places you are with him you're enjoying all the promises all the blessings everything he promis you receive them in Heavenly places what is the difference between into natural or Supernatural hardly nothing hardly nothing they're both natural when brother Bram called for the squirrels was that natural or superal it was superal superal Supernatural produced the natural and the natural was a squirtle don't kill me it's a Hony I'm I'm in space and I'm Supernatural and I got giftes of this no you have that what we have is a natural doing Supernatural don't know about that's why he don't N I tell you Earthly things you don't believe me what if I was to tell you the supernatural what if I was to tell you where is your body you say this is my body yes but that body is going to Decay Paul saw the supernatural he said I know that if this body be I have a more excellent Supernatural Wai for me in the heaven Supernatural is not something just just you know like you know how people want to get religious oh I I Sawan that's what you saw when I see God doing something it's natural and because God did did it it's super super but it's still natural he told Brother Brom how many squirrels did you say you wanted didn't you say you wanted three he said that's only two and he got another one and he shot it and then he said Visions don't but the natural don't get so religious to be a fanatic just be humble but you can't you cannot be what you're not when you have the nature of God you will do God's things only that and solely that because that's God don't you love him how much do you love him the Elder to the elected lady and her children to those that know the truth how many know the truth I know the truth and the truth makes us free God bless you [Music] [Music]
