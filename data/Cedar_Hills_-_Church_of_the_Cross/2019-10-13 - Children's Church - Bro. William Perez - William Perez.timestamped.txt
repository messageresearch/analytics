[33:07] well he seemed that there's many things
[33:12] that we find in our lives sometimes
[33:15] especially school or like sister like
[33:18] man this test is impossible right tease
[33:21] the sister says yes so we're going to
[33:24] read a scripture and then we're going to
[33:25] say a prayer and then I'll get you up
[33:29] here when everybody says down okay buddy
[33:33] all right let's turn into how many
[33:35] brought their Bibles today
[33:36] oh all right it seems like pretty much
[33:42] all of the the children brought their
[33:44] Bibles all right all right let's turn
[33:48] into the book of Saint Luke chapter 18
[33:51] verse 27 can somebody be brave enough
[33:56] and read this scripture for me my man he
[34:04] said the things which are impossible
[34:06] with men with men are possible with God
[34:11] all right Thank You bud amen
[34:14] I mean the Lord has blessings to the
[34:15] reading of the word and you may be
[34:16] seated so I like that scripture it says
[34:22] with men or with us as children even as
[34:28] adults we sometimes find things that are
[34:32] impossible brother Avram right there
[34:35] raised up his hand right before we did
[34:37] the scripture I think he might have
[34:39] something to share right no okay yes
[34:44] come on up let's tell us
[34:53] whatever you think the test at school oh
[34:57] my gosh that's what I'm talking about he
[35:00] said the test at school was so easy what
[35:05] we got we got time for one more the
[35:12] PARCC test that I had to take was
[35:17] impossible did you make it through all
[35:19] right she made it through so tonight I
[35:28] want to show you something that's
[35:30] impossible everybody's eyes guys what is
[35:36] it how many know what this is what is it
[35:46] sister right here a paper all right
[35:50] everybody understand this is a paper
[35:52] right I needed a couple volunteers
[35:55] tonight neither maybe with two ladies
[35:59] someone have you and this one right here
[36:03] Natalie come on over so what I want you
[36:09] to do hope it's all right with their
[36:12] parents is that okay
[36:13] it's nothing dangerous okay what I want
[36:16] you to do is either one of you I want
[36:21] you to fit yourself into this paper
[36:23] inside of I want you to go through this
[36:25] paper I want you to fit your body inside
[36:33] of this paper why not
[36:41] so it so if this paper was a circle you
[36:44] could fit yourself inside of it okay if
[36:47] it was not just so so what are you
[36:48] saying right now is that this is that
[36:52] what I said is it impossible okay so do
[36:56] you think now her being her size Natalie
[36:59] can she fit herself inside of this paper
[37:02] why not
[37:04] it's smoke but she's smaller than you
[37:09] okay so we need a bigger piece of paper
[37:14] okay all right fair enough
[37:17] thank you thank you very much so we've
[37:23] determined that a child cannot fit
[37:30] through this piece of paper right
[37:35] brother Andres it's impossible correct
[37:40] because you're a man right well you're a
[37:43] young man your mom and he says he's a
[37:47] man
[37:49] so everybody under s he is a man so
[37:54] that's why he can he can tell the
[37:57] scripture can you put this up for us the
[38:01] scripture we were reading last Luke
[38:03] 18:27 so with men under this it's
[38:14] impossible with men to fit your body
[38:19] into this piece of paper just told us
[38:24] all right we're going to do something
[38:27] here that when God when when man says
[38:32] it's impossible God says it's possible
[38:45] sometimes things don't work out the way
[38:49] thank you appreciate that sometimes
[38:59] things are just better with music you
[39:00] know everybody's all intense right now
[39:06] you know this was so much easier in my
[39:09] kitchen with nobody staring at me than
[39:13] it is with like a hundred people staring
[39:15] at me
[39:16] so by the way thank you for your
[39:18] attention and I appreciate that it makes
[39:20] me feel a lot better you know hold on
[39:23] I'm out thank you I was telling brother
[39:27] David before we started I said you know
[39:32] the scariest or the most nervous times
[39:37] I've had we're not in that convention
[39:41] now it's a children's church flat-out
[39:48] because it means you guys if we lose you
[39:50] we know we've lost you guys are just
[39:52] like so it's important to have your
[39:58] attention good
[40:11] this is not a magic trick okay not a
[40:14] magician
[40:15] but I want you I want you two to see
[40:18] something that when man says it's
[40:22] impossible to fit yourself through a
[40:26] piece of paper God has another plan we
[40:36] have no idea what God's plan is but this
[40:42] is what God does when he starts working
[40:45] out his plan
[40:53] what are these alright
[40:56] what thank you sister alright good job
[41:01] so God starts and says haha those guys
[41:07] over there in Las Cruces believe it's
[41:11] impossible to fit a human being through
[41:15] an eight and a half by 11 inch piece of
[41:19] copy paper want to let you know this
[41:23] demonstration is sponsored by our tape
[41:25] library thank you very much please see
[41:28] them immediately after service
[41:38] guys are awesome
[41:40] loving that all right God starts to do
[41:47] something he starts to cut uh-oh what is
[41:55] it
[42:04] [Music]
[42:12] I just started come on guys
[42:21] very funny guys
[42:24] [Music]
[42:36] people get so impatient
[42:38] you believe that start playing jeopardy
[42:41] music come on
[42:47] remember that's almost done oh I'm gonna
[42:56] need somebody Matt I need a big person
[43:04] so brother Matt's gonna help us okay we
[43:07] determined we cannot fit a child cannot
[43:12] fit through a piece of paper much less
[43:16] an adult but here's God starts keeps on
[43:27] cutting he's working
[43:34] [Music]
[43:40] and he's working
[43:44] and
[43:50] [Music]
[43:59] almost done
[44:17] so here we go in life man that test was
[44:21] so hard it's impossible for anyone to
[44:26] pass this test when you're small things
[44:32] in life are humongous right things in
[44:41] life are so difficult we say wow there's
[44:45] no way that it's possible for me to pass
[44:51] this test there's no way I can do this
[44:57] but remember in the beginning we said
[45:04] it's impossible for man to fit through
[45:08] this piece of paper and that was by a
[45:12] man brother Matt we took a piece of
[45:19] paper and said Matt try and fit yourself
[45:24] through here
[45:25] can't be done how are we but God oh he
[45:36] has a special way it's a way that we
[45:43] have no idea how he's going to do it but
[45:48] I tell you guys if you have just a
[45:51] little bit of faith just like what you
[45:54] have right now you had faith in me right
[45:55] that I could do something right but
[45:58] imagine if you had a little faith in God
[46:00] and God said hey whatever you're going
[46:04] through it's okay you're gonna pass
[46:07] through it it's possible so now what we
[46:13] have done is we've gotten a piece of
[46:17] paper eight-and-a-half by 11 inches and
[46:24] we've created a way that
[46:28] men can go through this piece of paper
[46:35] so remember what was impossible to you
[46:40] guys it's it's possible with God he just
[46:45] did it pretty simple right anybody else
[46:58] want to try it you're thinking and
[46:59] anybody else wanna try it come on
[47:01] undress undress was the biggest skeptic
[47:04] he said it can't be done thank you my
[47:17] man so remember one thing if you get one
[47:22] thing tonight with God
[47:32] with God what all things are what all
[47:35] things are possible imagine that how
[47:41] many want to give just maybe just a
[47:43] short testimony of something that was
[47:46] impossible just so we could share come
[47:49] on sup sister she raised her hands so
[47:53] fast so I want you thank you it's to a
[48:00] possible all right yeah

[48:13] yeah I had a hard time line up sister

[48:56] control and you can get whatever you
