[38:10] Trevor explicates to Vista de ikita km q
[38:13] one with an opposing view otro computer
[38:17] vista op was placed on the listener in
[38:19] escucha is not at all listening no esta
[38:24] paranoia escuchando that he might learn
[38:27] que el kiseop we are in depth but is
[38:30] lessening paris escuchando only so
[38:34] lamenting to refute what is being said
