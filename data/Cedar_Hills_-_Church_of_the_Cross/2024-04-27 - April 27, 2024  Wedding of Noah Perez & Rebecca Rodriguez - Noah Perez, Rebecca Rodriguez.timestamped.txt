[24:04] bonds of holy matrimony
[24:50] let us
[24:51] pray Almighty and Heavenly Father we're
[24:55] here this afternoon
[24:57] Lord with brother Noah and sister
[25:00] Rebecca as they have come to you Lord
[25:02] and have lived a Christian Life and have
[25:06] lived an ex e exemplary life in front of
[25:10] the Believers we ask father that you
[25:12] will bless them on their special day
[25:14] Lord may your hand of grace and mercy
[25:17] reach out to them Lord and may you that
[25:21] is the Fountain of all love come today
[25:24] Lord to fulfill their lives Lord we know
[25:27] that you are love
[25:28] and we're grateful Lord that we have
[25:30] been able to come here this afternoon
[25:33] may they be patient with each other may
[25:36] they understand each other as you have
[25:38] come down to understand better who we
[25:41] are May Lord as as time goes by may you
[25:46] fill their lives may they forgive learn
[25:49] to forgive each other may they forgive
[25:51] their each other's uh failures but may
[25:55] they be able to grow together in the
[25:59] strengths that you have to them Lord we
[26:02] place them in your hands along with this
[26:05] congregation in the name of the Lord
[26:07] Jesus Christ
[26:09] amen you may be seated
[26:38] I thought it um appropriate to call this
[26:41] poem Noah and
[26:45] Becky we are also blessed to be able to
[26:47] witness such an event it is rare to find
[26:51] a love story with Purity the way it was
[26:54] meant lifting up Faith in a time when
[26:56] such living just doesn't seem
[26:59] plausible likening Christ and his bride
[27:03] proving with him anything's
[27:06] possible inspiring stares in Becky's
[27:09] eyes when Noah comes
[27:12] around a beautiful display of how love
[27:14] can speak without making a
[27:17] sound many have heard of Rebecca's
[27:20] beauty and how Isaac's love was almost
[27:22] more than he could
[27:23] handle Noah's smile for you says that
[27:27] Isaac Rebecca can't even hold a
[27:31] candle one day Noah you might have the
[27:35] privilege of growing old and
[27:37] gray all your teeth might be
[27:40] gone but still smile at her like you do
[27:44] today hair might be all white Becky and
[27:47] your vision failing and dim and yet may
[27:51] your eyes still twinkle every time you
[27:53] look at
[27:55] him remember marriage is not two it's
[27:59] actually
[28:00] three eventually so intertwined that
[28:03] Christ is the only one left to
[28:06] see because he's at the center holding
[28:09] you both and provides a place to meet
[28:12] especially when hard times come because
[28:14] they will but in the center there's no
[28:18] defeat Christ has given you today a good
[28:21] wife which is right up there with your
[28:24] salvation clearly you both have favor
[28:27] with God and and we'll build him a house
[28:29] with a strong
[28:30] foundation and if ever that house cracks
[28:33] or mold begins to enter pitch it with
[28:36] the Holy Spirit and come back to your
[28:40] Center everything inside of you says
[28:43] Becky was meant to be your bride
[28:45] returning your rib where it came from
[28:48] back to your
[28:49] side everyone here can tell a love story
[28:53] but yours will be one that's
[28:55] incomparable zero doubt two God people
[28:59] it's the making of a perfect
[29:01] Parable
[29:04] [Applause]

[33:10] the
[33:11] gospel didn't matter what where he was
[33:14] at what he was
[33:16] doing but I tell you our wedding day was
[33:20] was such a day that the only thing
[33:22] missing from from it was a prayer
[33:24] line he HD everything from tithing
[33:28] to
[33:29] Salvation New Birth and I'm there an

[34:39] hours we had something
[34:42] uh something tragic occur at the time
[34:46] should have been
[34:47] tragic um as she was as she was
[34:51] delivering the doctor said uh the
[34:54] umbilical cord is wrapped around your
[34:55] baby his neck three times and your wife
[34:59] whenever she's she's she's pushing she's
[35:02] she's choking him almost to

[35:18] prep her he came out again and he said I
[35:21] have I have some news for you I said he
[35:25] said he said it's either going to be
[35:27] your wife or it's going to be your child
[35:29] but it ain't going to be
[35:33] both at that moment
[35:36] I I went with my with my dad as as he
[35:39] was in the as he was in the waiting room
[35:42] I told him the news I said Dad it's I
[35:44] it's it's not going to be both it's it's
[35:46] it's either
[35:48] or he said well let's
[35:52] pray about 10 minutes passed I I went to
[35:55] go check on my wife I came out and and
[35:58] to see what what was going on and he
[36:00] goes I just received a vision from the
[36:03] Lord he said both of them are going to
[36:05] make
[36:07] it and sure
[36:09] enough about 45 minutes
[36:13] later precious baby boy came
[36:17] out and 22 years today because of
[36:21] that because of that he is here
[36:25] today and what a Wonder ful thing it is
[36:28] what a wonderful blessing he he is for
[36:31] my wife and I not just for us but for
[36:33] many around
[36:35] him I look at their relationship and I
[36:38] see how how beautiful Rebecca is how
[36:42] sweet and how kind and how much she
[36:45] loves the Lord and I can say that it
[36:48] comes from a man and and and a a man and
[36:52] a woman a brother and a sister that have
[36:56] put in put their time their effort and
[36:58] their love and to their daughter and I
[37:00] would say brother Robert sister spring
[37:03] congratulations for for raising such a
[37:06] wonderful a wonderful
[37:09] daughter you look in you look in uh in
[37:14] relationships
[37:16] nowadays and pretty much anything
[37:20] goes you know it's very very rare do you
[37:24] find a
[37:26] relationship do you find a a courtship
[37:30] an engagement and into a
[37:32] marriage that started off pure and ended
[37:36] pure you don't find that and to see a
[37:40] couple that has done
[37:43] things the correct
[37:45] way the right
[37:48] way and it really you can really see in
[37:52] in these in these uh verses of scripture
[37:56] that we just read
[37:58] said that yes it endureth all
[38:02] things that love not just for each
[38:06] other because it just doesn't take two
[38:10] in a
[38:11] marriage many people that's what that's
[38:14] what they think well it's just my wife
[38:16] and
[38:17] I and that's not the
[38:19] case the case that in every
[38:22] marriage that it takes three
[38:27] and when you have Christ as the center
[38:30] of your
[38:32] marriage Christ as the center of your
[38:34] love and your
[38:35] relationship there is nothing that comes
[38:38] against you that you cannot
[38:41] handle and that's why love endureth all
[38:46] things because God not just not does he
[38:50] just express
[38:52] love but he is
[38:55] love and when we see see
[38:58] that whatever comes whatever whatever
[39:01] arises because things will get difficult
[39:05] just ask any married couple here things
[39:08] aren't always peaches and
[39:10] cream things are difficult sometimes the
[39:12] road gets a little bumpy the road gets
[39:16] hard but you have those times not just
[39:19] to lean on each other but to lean on the
[39:21] Lord because he is why he is the reason
[39:25] why we are here
[39:28] you know as I was
[39:30] um as I was uh thinking
[39:34] about your relationship and and all the
[39:39] the the times that we've had you know
[39:43] God gave me three boys for a
[39:48] reason and the reason was because I
[39:51] could have such precious
[39:55] daughters and it's one down two to
[40:00] go so I'm thankful this morning or this
[40:03] afternoon for what God has blessed us
[40:06] with blessed us with a son now he has
[40:09] blessed us with the
[40:12] daughter and if I can say if these
[40:15] words that have been spoken this this
[40:18] this
[40:19] afternoon if I can just say it anything
[40:23] or if you can just remember anything
[40:25] remember that at the the center is
[40:29] Christ always always
[40:33] amen and I pray that the Lord would
[40:36] bless you and keep
[40:38] you and if there is anything any any
[40:41] relationship that you could look at I

[42:11] tell all right I was there at one
[42:16] time it's your
[42:19] decision whether you want your story to
[42:22] be a
[42:24] parable or if you just want to be
[42:26] another story
[42:29] a parable is an Earthly story with a
[42:31] Heavenly
[42:33] meaning and only the bride of
[42:36] Christ has a he has an Earthly story
[42:38] with a Heavenly
[42:41] be everyone else is just Earthly
[42:44] stories but you will choose from this
[42:46] day forward what you will do with your
[42:48] lives and how you will you will live

[42:51] life but I'm very proud of both of you I
[42:54] want to tell you as your pastor I'm
[42:56] proud to be your pastor I'm proud that
[42:59] you all have done you've chosen to do
[43:01] things right there's a plan that has
[43:04] been laid out you follow the plan and
[43:08] it's brought you here keep following the
[43:11] plan it'll take you home so as you
[43:15] stand I guess we might as well after
[43:19] will said what he said I was seriously
[43:21] thinking about ties and offerings and
[43:27] and getting a long sermon going again
[43:30] but if I start I ain't stopping for a
[43:32] long
[43:35] time it's an honor to be here with you
[43:38] along with all you witnesses that have
[43:40] come God bless you it's always a
[43:43] pleasure to see new and old friends that
[43:47] have come to be with us in this
[43:50] tremendous
[43:53] celebration before I go on I want you to
[43:57] look through the veil look at
[44:01] her is that the one you worked seven
[44:03] years
[44:05] for oh just making sure you got to make
[44:08] sure she's the one that you're agreeing
[44:10] to marry right yeah stranger things have
[44:13] happened Through The
[44:14] Years so she is the one all right all
[44:18] right this is the one you you choose to
[44:20] marry to okay making
[44:23] sure well Ephesians the 5ifth chapter CH
[44:27] tells us verse 31 says for this cause
[44:31] shall a man leave his father and mother
[44:34] shall be joined unto his wife and they
[44:36] too shall be one
[44:38] flesh this is a great
[44:41] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[44:43] and the church nevertheless let every
[44:46] one of you in particular so love his
[44:48] wife even as himself and the wife see
[44:52] that she reverends her
[44:55] husband now let's get into it all right
[45:00] dearly beloved we are gathered here
[45:03] together in the sight of God and the
[45:05] face of this company to join together
[45:08] this man and this woman in holy
[45:10] matrimony which is commanded by St Paul
[45:12] to be honorable among all men it is
[45:16] therefore not by any to be entered into
[45:19] unadvisable or lightly but reverently
[45:23] discreetly soberly and in the fear of
[45:25] God and into this state this holy state
[45:29] that these two persons present that
[45:32] they're present come to be joined if
[45:35] there's anyone here that can show a Just
[45:37] Cause as to why they should not lawfully
[45:39] be joined together in this holy
[45:41] matrimony do you now speak or from
[45:44] Hereafter forever hold your
[45:53] peace I will require and will charge you
[45:55] both as you will surely answer at the
[45:57] day of judgment when the secrets of All
[46:00] Hearts shall be disclosed if there's
[46:02] either of you that know any impediment
[46:05] why you should not be lawful joined
[46:07] together in this holy matrimony do you
[46:10] now confess it or be it assured unto you
[46:12] that any couples that are joined
[46:14] otherwise than God's word doth allow
[46:17] their marriage is not
[46:19] lawful but duly believing you have
[46:22] considered this solemn obligation you're
[46:24] about to assume and that you have
[46:26] prepared to enter upon the same
