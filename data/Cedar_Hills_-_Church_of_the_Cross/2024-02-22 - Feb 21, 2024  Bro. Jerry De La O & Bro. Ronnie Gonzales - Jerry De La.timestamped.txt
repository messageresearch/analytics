[30:36] evening there we go I know it's

[30:51] no other place we'd rather
[30:55] be and right here
[30:58] not hearing from
[31:00] me but from hear hearing from God this
[31:02] evening
[31:05] amen I may not to take too much time but
[31:08] uh
[31:10] let's get to our scripture in Matthew
[31:17] 15 and I'm GNA start with uh verse
[31:21] 21 you know
[31:37] man and it reads like
[31:39] this then Jesus went then and departed
[31:42] into the coast of Ty and
[31:50] sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came
[31:53] out of the same coast and Cried unto him
[31:56] saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son
[31:59] of David my daughter is grievously vexed
[32:03] with a
[32:16] devil but he answered her not a word and
[32:19] his disciples came and Bes besought him
[32:22] saying send her away for she crith after
[32:26] us
[32:35] but he answered and said I am not sent
[32:38] unto the lost sheep of the House of
[32:45] Israel then came she and worshiped him
[32:48] saying Lord help
[32:55] me but he answered and said it is not me
[32:59] to take the children's bread and cast it
[33:01] to
[33:06] dogs and she said truth Lord yet the
[33:10] dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from
[33:13] the master's
[33:20] table then answered then Jesus answered
[33:24] and said unto her oh woman great is thy
[33:28] faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt
[33:33] and her daughter was made whole from
[33:34] that very
[33:45] hour may the Lord add the blessing to
[33:47] the read reading of his word and you may
[33:49] be
[33:51] seated you know and we we have a
[33:54] situation here
[33:57] we we we have this this uh this
[34:01] lady and and she has a
[34:05] need but her need her need to her was
[34:08] was was
[34:11] great but but you see
[34:15] here Jesus didn't think it was that I
[34:18] shouldn't say didn't think that but but
[34:20] but he wasn't sent to
[34:26] her but but what she needed was
[34:30] great you know and how many of us have a
[34:34] need you know how many of us struggle
[34:36] with certain
[34:39] things you know and her need was so
[34:44] great that she was not going to leave
[34:48] there until she got an
[34:51] answer you know and sometimes we have a
[34:56] need and we want something done right
[35:01] away and if it's not done right right
[35:03] away we we we we as
[35:08] humans we give
[35:10] up we're like oh never
[35:14] mind he he don't care about
[35:17] me but but not this
[35:20] lady she had a
[35:23] need and she was persistent in her need
[35:28] you know she was persistent as to what
[35:30] she
[35:32] needed she was persistent as to what she
[35:37] wanted you know there there's times
[35:39] where where we have
[35:42] needs and we want
[35:44] something or we need something from the
[35:48] Lord but we want it right then and
[35:53] there sometimes it'll
[35:55] happen sometimes it won't
[35:58] but we cannot give
[36:00] up you know because we have one
[36:04] goal because if we want to be persistent
[36:07] in
[36:09] something we we there's a goal that that
[36:11] we have to be persistent
[36:15] in and we're pers we can be persistent
[36:18] in the things of the
[36:21] Lord which is good and that's what
[36:24] that's what the Lord
[36:26] wants because our ultimate
[36:30] goal should be to make it
[36:33] home right our ultimate goal is to make
[36:36] it
[36:38] home it's not to be part of this
[36:42] world our ultimate goal is to make it
[36:45] home and we're going to have
[36:48] trials and tribulations on that
[36:51] road the devil is going to do everything
[36:56] possible knock us off that
[36:59] road but we can't give
[37:02] up we can't
[37:05] quit but at the same time there's
[37:07] persistence in the things of
[37:12] God but also but also we can pers be
[37:16] persistent in the things of the
[37:20] world right we can also be persistent in
[37:23] the things of the
[37:26] world and that's what where the devil
[37:28] will try and get
[37:32] us he wants
[37:34] you to take your
[37:37] mind off the ultimate
[37:40] goal he doesn't want you to find your
[37:44] purpose he doesn't want you to know who
[37:46] you
[37:49] serve he doesn't want you to give all
[37:51] your heart to the Lord Jesus
[37:53] Christ but ultimately that should be the
[37:56] goal
[37:59] to give our heart to the
[38:01] Lord because we cannot be part of this
[38:05] world we we can't have this be one foot
[38:09] in the
[38:10] world and one foot in
[38:13] church and walk
[38:15] both it can't be
[38:17] done you either sell all the way out to
[38:21] the
[38:23] world and sell all the way into Jesus
[38:26] Christ
[38:39] but you know for for for for the most
[38:43] part
[38:45] persistence is linked very closely to
[38:51] endurance because you because you got to
[38:54] have a lot of endurance for this trip
[38:57] that we're
[39:01] taking because it's not a short
[39:05] Journey but how many has it been for you
[39:08] a long
[39:10] journey this has been a long
[39:13] road but don't quit
[39:17] now don't quit
[39:19] now because we are so
[39:22] close it is so
[39:24] close and it would be a shame to quit
[39:27] now
[39:30] that's a de that's what the devil wants
[39:32] from
[39:33] us you know he wants us to get so
[39:36] far he wants us to do
[39:39] this and then he's trying to get us to
[39:41] turn
[39:43] back you know every
[39:45] day how many every
[39:48] day does the devil try and do something
[39:51] to
[39:53] you every day right I mean I don't think
[39:56] there's a day that goes by that that
[39:58] that he doesn't try to distract us
[40:05] somehow the devil is persistent in what
[40:08] he's trying to do to
[40:11] us but we in turn got to be persistent
[40:14] in
[40:17] God to overcome that
[40:22] situation and how do we overcome that
[40:24] situation
[40:27] by listening to the
[40:30] World by dealing with the
[40:32] World by hanging out with the
[40:35] world but we overcome that situation by
[40:38] getting the word inside of
[40:43] us every single this of this
[40:47] word get it to dwell inside of each and
[40:50] every one of
[40:52] us that's how we can fight
[40:55] him that is how he can be
[40:59] defeated because we cannot give
[41:02] up if we look at Noah in the
[41:06] Bible they they said the Lord told me it
[41:09] was going to
[41:11] rain to build an
[41:15] AR because it's going to rain but up
[41:18] until that point it had never rained on
[41:20] the
[41:22] Earth but Noah did not give up
[41:27] he he kept going on he it's going to
[41:30] rain it's going to rain the Lord said
[41:34] it's going to
[41:35] rain he did whatever the Lord told
[41:38] him and they look at him and they tell
[41:40] him nah you're crazy Noah for doing
[41:44] that no it's going to
[41:46] rain and then one
[41:49] day he was
[41:51] prepared not the
[41:53] others but he was
[41:56] prepared rain came
[41:58] down because he did not give
[42:01] up he did not quit on God's
[42:05] word the same with
[42:07] Abraham when he told him he was going to
[42:09] have a
[42:11] son and he finally had a
[42:14] son and then the Lord told
[42:16] him what did he had to do with that
[42:20] son right he told him he had to sacrif
[42:23] he wanted him to sacrifice him
[42:27] so he got everything
[42:29] ready he put even put the wood on his
[42:32] son's
[42:35] back and his son got there and they got
[42:37] everything
[42:40] prepared and he didn't doubt the
[42:43] Lord here is here is the
[42:46] evidence that he had a
[42:48] son and he did everything exactly like
[42:51] the Lord told
[42:53] him he was persistent into what the Lord
[42:56] told him
[42:59] he even had the knife right here ready
[43:01] to go
[43:03] down he was
[43:05] ready he was
[43:07] ready and then all of a sudden there's
[43:10] a ram in the in the
[43:14] bushes because he didn't doubt one word
[43:17] of
[43:20] God he knew the Lord would make a
[43:24] way and that's the way it is with each
[43:26] and every one of us
[43:28] us no matter what we go
[43:31] through no matter what Trials come our
[43:35] way no matter what sickness comes our
[43:38] way the devil cannot stand in the way of
[43:41] the plan of the Lord of of our Lord
[43:43] Jesus
[43:46] Christ whatever he tries to do to
[43:53] us he's already defeated
[43:57] and we got to walk around knowing
[44:00] that that he is already
[44:03] defeated but every step that we
[44:08] take we're being
[44:10] persistent because we got to go
[44:13] forward we got to keep going
[44:16] forward we got to keep going forward we
[44:19] can't go
[44:20] back there's nothing there for us
[44:23] anymore I'm
[44:24] sorry there's nothing there for us
[44:28] anymore what we did back there ain't no
[44:32] good but what we're doing right now for
[44:35] the Lord Jesus
[44:37] Christ is to serve him is to give all
[44:41] our heart to him this
[44:44] evening it's not to forget what he did
[44:46] for
[44:48] us he tries to bring into remembrance
[44:51] the things that we
[44:54] did the things that I did
[44:58] but if we realize all that is under the
[45:03] blood so when he looks down he doesn't
[45:05] see the sin
[45:08] anymore he sees you under the
[45:11] blood so once that sin is under the
[45:14] blood don't pull it back
[45:17] out leave it there leave it there it's
[45:22] covered sins are covered
[45:27] that's
[45:32] right we
[45:34] see there's persistent in the things of
[45:39] God but there's also persistence in
[45:44] sin you know and if if you go I'm not
[45:46] going to go to it because because it'll
[45:48] probably take too much
[45:51] time but if you read in First Kings 21
[45:57] and and and in there
[46:01] Ahab he asked this this
[46:05] gentleman to give him his
[46:08] property he want he wanted that
[46:11] property and the man said no I can't
[46:14] give that to
[46:16] you it's been in my
[46:19] family and so Ahab he was kind of
[46:25] disappointed so he tells his his
[46:28] wife or she asked him what happened why
[46:31] why do you look so so uh so sad so so
[46:38] depressed why asked him for his land and
[46:40] he wouldn't give it to
[46:43] me but needless to say she was
[46:45] persistent that he was going to have
[46:52] that she she was persistent that that
[46:56] she wanted that for her
[47:00] husband if we can turn to that real
[47:02] quick first second First Kings
[47:09] 21 17
[47:29] and the word of the Lord came to Elijah
[47:31] the
[47:35] saying arise go down to meet Ahab king
[47:38] of
[47:39] Israel which is in
[47:49] Samaria behold he is in the vineyard of
[47:52] NE
[47:53] Nebo whether it whether he has gone down
[47:56] to possess
[48:02] it and thou shalt speak unto him saying
[48:05] thus sayith the Lord hast thou killed
[48:08] and also taken
[48:16] possession and th and thou shalt speak
[48:18] unto him saying thus sayeth the Lord in
[48:21] the place where dogs lick the blood of
[48:23] nebul shall dogs lick the blood even th
[48:38] so if we stay persistent in
[48:42] sin we will be
[48:44] judged he was judged right
[48:47] here because it that wasn't it it wasn't
[48:50] he wasn't supposed to do it like
[48:54] that he did wrong
[48:57] so he was judged right
[48:59] here so if we stay persistent in the
[49:02] things we're not supposed
[49:05] to we will be
[49:08] judged and we don't want to be
[49:10] judged we want to be persistent in the
[49:13] things of God this
[49:15] evening we want to be persistent in what
[49:18] God has for
[49:20] us the good that God has for
[49:24] us because the blessings are right there
[49:26] for you and
[49:29] I the healing is right there for you and
[49:33] I salvation is right there for you and
[49:38] I but it doesn't come
[49:40] easy we got to work for
[49:43] it we got to fight for it we got to
[49:46] struggle for it but it's right there we
[49:50] got to have
[49:52] faith we got to pray we got to be strong
[49:56] in the
[49:58] no matter what he tries to do to
[50:01] us no matter the situation he tries to
[50:04] put in front of
[50:07] us we got to keep on keeping on this
[50:11] evening we got to keep on keeping on for
[50:14] the
[50:15] Lord we got to
[50:17] struggle we got to
[50:19] battle we got to fight but know one
[50:24] thing the battle is already w
[50:28] the victory is already
[50:30] won we are dealing with a defeated enemy
[50:33] this
[50:35] evening he can't harm
[50:37] you he can't touch you but he can put
[50:41] trials in front of
[50:43] you he can put struggles in front of
[50:46] you but we keep keep on keeping on this
[50:52] evening and
[50:55] closing it's it's been a
[50:58] struggle it's been a
[51:01] battle everything that we do is is a
[51:05] battle and if if you sit there this
[51:07] evening and and you think everything is
[51:11] easy and you say oh there I have no
[51:16] trials check
[51:20] yourself because as
[51:23] Christians we should never have it easy
[51:27] if it's too
[51:28] easy check
[51:30] ourselves see what's wrong it might it
[51:34] might sound
[51:35] crazy you know you talk to people in the
[51:40] world and they and I always talk to him
[51:42] and they oh man we have it so
[51:47] easy and this and this is going good for
[51:50] me and they say how's it going for
[51:53] you I said it's going good
[51:57] I'm not I'm not going to give the devil
[52:00] credit we give him too much
[52:03] credit it's going
[52:05] good it's been a
[52:08] struggle but it's going good this has
[52:11] happened to
[52:12] me but it's not going to stop
[52:15] us because our ultimate
[52:18] goal our ultimate goal this
[52:21] evening is to make it
[52:24] home is to cross over to the the other
[52:27] side it's to see our loved ones that
[52:30] have already made it
[52:32] home that is our
[52:35] goal that is our our journey right
[52:38] now and don't give
[52:40] up amen God bless you
[52:43] [Applause]
[52:59] amen God bless you this
[53:02] evening brother Jerry brother Noah thank
[53:06] you amen would you all please stand as
[53:08] we read the
[53:12] word this scripture is going to be
[53:14] really easy for everybody to
[53:18] find Genesis
[53:21] 1:1 back to the beginning amen
[53:27] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[53:30] and the
[53:33] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[53:36] void and darkness was upon the face of
[53:39] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[53:42] upon the face of the
[53:50] waters and God said let there be light
[53:56] and there was
[53:58] light turn to verse
[54:02] 26 well-known
[54:06] scripture and God said let us make man
[54:09] in our
[54:12] image after our
[54:15] likeness and let them have dominion over
[54:17] the fish of the
[54:19] sea and over the fowl of the
[54:22] air and over the cattle and over all the
[54:26] Earth
[54:27] and over every creepy thing that
[54:29] creepeth upon the
[54:32] Earth am man you be
[54:38] seated amen so today I'm going to
[54:40] continue a little bit what I what I uh
[54:42] spoke on for the New Year's Eve
[54:46] service so this is my little little
[54:49] series part two of what think you of
[54:53] Christ not to take anything away from
[54:55] our pastor but since that's what he's on
[54:57] and that's how God's been dealing with
[55:02] me so I want to I'm gonna continue on
[55:05] that
[55:06] also with the
[55:08] subtitle Let There
[55:10] Be amen amen amen so last time I asked
[55:15] the
[55:17] question what think ye of
[55:21] Christ don't don't just hear
[55:24] me think about it
[55:27] what think ye of
[55:30] Christ as I said last
[55:33] time most people are going to think
[55:35] about about Jesus on
[55:39] Calvary for some in the message they're
[55:41] going to think of the
[55:45] Prophet some of us might think of the
[55:48] form that Jesus came to
[55:52] us or the form that he came to you
[55:56] maybe uh our pastor
[55:58] maybe maybe one of the
[56:01] ministers everybody's going to have an
[56:04] image of what they think of
[56:08] Christ now that I said that is that
[56:11] working in your
[56:13] mind what think ye of
[56:17] Christ amen
[56:19] amen but very seldom do we think of
[56:23] ourselves
[56:26] amen again we always think of the person
[56:28] that's had the biggest influence on
[56:31] us or or how Jesus came to
[56:34] us amen amen how often or how many of
[56:39] you thought of
[56:40] yourselves when I asked that
[56:45] question why why
[56:49] not no we're not
[56:51] Christ we're not the Christ the person
[56:54] of Christ
[56:56] because if we were then that would make
[56:58] us an
[57:00] antichrist
[57:02] amen but somebody might say oh well you
[57:04] see brother Ronnie I just you know are
[57:07] we I just I I don't do this or I don't
[57:09] do
[57:11] that I can't do this or I can't do
[57:15] that you see brother Ronnie I just don't
[57:17] have
[57:19] it and that's where the problem
[57:22] ISS that's a trick of the enemy
[57:26] as I said last time the word overcome
[57:28] means to maintain life in
[57:33] you amen amen but uh but according to
[57:36] brother brandham he also says
[57:39] this overcome means to recognize the
[57:42] devil and every one of his
[57:46] tricks remember that remember when I
[57:49] read that the last
[57:50] time but we to recognize him devil but
[57:55] we must recognize that God in
[57:58] you is greater and mightier than he
[58:03] is the god in
[58:08] who the god in
[58:12] who the god in
[58:15] who the God in Me me amen because if we
[58:19] leave it here with brother brandham says
[58:21] that word of God doesn't do us no good
[58:26] it's always in the past amen but we have
[58:29] to see the god in
[58:31] you amen now today I'm going to get a
[58:34] little bit personal
[58:36] today today I'm today I'm gonna speak
[58:38] nothing but my
[58:41] experiences I'm not going to speak about
[58:43] my trials my
[58:45] tribulations but if something like that
[58:47] comes
[58:48] up may my trials may my tribulations be
[58:52] your stepping stone
[58:56] learn from the
[58:58] experience you know so so for years so
[59:01] for years I I pray that and I wanted the
[59:04] life of Jesus inside of
[59:07] me anybody pray
[59:09] that to be like
[59:11] Jesus I I pray to have his
[59:14] life you know that I would read the
[59:17] messages listen to brother brandham and
[59:20] and to see how God would use
[59:24] them God that makes us for me that would
[59:26] make such an impact in my life as a
[59:28] young
[59:30] man and I thought to myself I wish I
[59:33] could have an impact on the people like
[59:35] he
[59:39] did I will see our founding
[59:43] Pastor the gift of faith that he
[59:47] had I mean I I would think to
[59:50] myself I wish I had a gift of faith like
[59:53] that
[59:56] oh I would see brother L the teachings
[59:58] that he would
[1:00:01] do I wish I could teach at
[1:00:04] him I would see Tommy junr how we all
[1:00:07] know how Tommy junr is Tommy J he gets
[1:00:11] up here he song leads and he gets a
[1:00:13] crowd
[1:00:16] moving oh when we have a grand old
[1:00:19] time and I thought to
[1:00:21] myself I wish I had that gift
[1:00:26] I would see brother
[1:00:29] Jimmy the sincerity of the
[1:00:32] man the genuine love that he has for the
[1:00:37] people to be able to go anywhere at any
[1:00:41] time didn't matter doesn't matter where
[1:00:44] the person's
[1:00:45] at I would say wow wow I wish I had that
[1:00:50] gift to see our pastor brother
[1:00:53] Caleb to make get these big deep
[1:00:57] subjects of the
[1:01:00] word to make them so simple that even a
[1:01:03] baby can
[1:01:05] understand a baby in the
[1:01:08] word I would see that I was like wow I
[1:01:11] wish I could do
[1:01:14] that anybody ever thought
[1:01:16] that and again I'm speaking on from my
[1:01:19] experience
[1:01:20] okay but the thing is I can't be them
[1:01:26] I can't no matter how much I try I
[1:01:30] can't see and and and that's where our
[1:01:32] mentality stays
[1:01:34] stuck I
[1:01:38] can't but the thing is this the flip
[1:01:41] side of the
[1:01:43] coin they can't do what I can
[1:01:46] do somebody might be thinking to
[1:01:48] themselves
[1:01:49] oh what do you do that's for me to find
[1:01:53] out that's I need to figure out the will
[1:01:54] of God in my life
[1:01:57] you figure out the will of God in your
[1:01:59] life and when you figure that
[1:02:02] out know what he can do what you can
[1:02:05] do no matter how uh what great man that
[1:02:08] they may
[1:02:09] be nobody can do what you can
[1:02:13] do you are
[1:02:15] unique it's like every person's like a
[1:02:17] like a
[1:02:20] thumbprint no no two people have the
[1:02:22] same thumb print
[1:02:26] print is unique to
[1:02:29] you amen amen what think he of
[1:02:34] Christ what think ye of
[1:02:38] yourself as I said last
[1:02:40] time I want Ronnie to
[1:02:43] die now I'm not talking about getting a
[1:02:45] gun and pulling the trigger and none of
[1:02:47] that
[1:02:49] stuff but I want that old
[1:02:53] nature that Gonzalez nature
[1:02:57] that's no good for nothing that that
[1:02:59] nature is contrary to
[1:03:01] God every human
[1:03:04] being your nature where you come from
[1:03:07] doesn't matter how tremendous your your
[1:03:09] father grandfather whoever may
[1:03:12] be it's a nature of the
[1:03:15] world contrary to
[1:03:17] God amen
[1:03:21] amen that Gonzalez negativity
[1:03:26] remember we spoke about that last
[1:03:28] time everybody's been speaking about
[1:03:30] that seems like right the last few
[1:03:32] services but that has to
[1:03:35] die amen amen and by God's grace it
[1:03:41] is now
[1:03:46] watch when all else fails
[1:03:50] you you're going to have
[1:03:53] failures people around you are going to
[1:03:55] fail
[1:04:02] I don't know where I came
[1:04:07] from one thing that will never fail you
[1:04:10] is
[1:04:12] God amen amen people may fail
[1:04:15] you and they
[1:04:17] will but one thing that God will never
[1:04:20] fail
[1:04:22] you never
[1:04:26] we see the highs and the lows of the
[1:04:28] life of
[1:04:30] David we read the Psalms we preach a lot
[1:04:32] of the
[1:04:33] Psalms a lot of the ministers preach on
[1:04:35] Psalms on the book of
[1:04:38] Psalms in the Book of Psalms you see the
[1:04:40] highest and you see the lows of David's
[1:04:44] life
[1:04:47] right but we're not here I'm not here to
[1:04:49] speak about my
[1:04:50] lows I'm here to speak about his highs
[1:04:56] the Bible says that David encouraged
[1:05:00] himself and that's where I found
[1:05:03] myself in the highs and the lows of
[1:05:05] Ronnie's
[1:05:07] life in Ronnie's Book of
[1:05:11] Psalms Ronnie but like I said God won't
[1:05:13] fail
[1:05:15] you so Ronnie encouraged
[1:05:20] himself now after I spoke the last
[1:05:23] time I was in the shower a few days
[1:05:25] after that
[1:05:27] I was washing my
[1:05:28] hair you know and and and I was there
[1:05:31] and I was and I was
[1:05:33] praying I'm there and and just like
[1:05:36] Lord Lord help
[1:05:38] me Lord help
[1:05:40] me help me Lord I don't want to be this
[1:05:44] way I want the Gonzalez nature to
[1:05:48] die Lord I don't want to be that
[1:05:52] way I'm in the shower and I'm praying
[1:05:54] this okay
[1:05:56] Lord help me Lord help me Lord help
[1:06:01] me now there when the Lord comes to you
[1:06:04] and speaks to
[1:06:05] you there's no fake in that
[1:06:10] presence there's no faking that
[1:06:17] presence there comes a time where God's
[1:06:19] Gonna GNA come to you and he's goingon
[1:06:21] to demand of you an answer
[1:06:26] like he did unto job job G up your loins
[1:06:29] and speak to me like a
[1:06:31] man and there that that's where Ronnie
[1:06:34] was at in the
[1:06:37] shower it was reflecting on my
[1:06:39] life I said Lord I help me
[1:06:43] Lord Lord I don't want these feelings
[1:06:46] that I don't want these feelings no
[1:06:48] more and I was crying out to
[1:06:51] him Lord Lord help me
[1:06:55] when all of a sudden he
[1:06:58] descends you sound like those men in the
[1:07:04] scripture Lord

[1:07:31] barber a
[1:07:33] hunter Ronnie Ronnie what are
[1:07:38] you am I not the high priest of your
[1:07:44] confession and I said yes Lord you are
[1:07:47] the high priest of My
[1:07:50] Confession then why ask me for help
[1:07:55] blew me
[1:07:56] away well Lord You're the one where my
[1:07:59] help comes

[1:08:03] help speak the word confess it with your
[1:08:08] mouth confess with your mouth that with
[1:08:10] what you
[1:08:14] are confess it constantly asking for
[1:08:18] help in a hope that God's gonna do
[1:08:22] something but we are commanded by the
[1:08:25] word to speak the
[1:08:28] word speak what you want to be and you
[1:08:31] with the power to create a world and go
[1:08:34] and live on
[1:08:36] it the words that we speak they either
[1:08:39] they're either life or
[1:08:42] death did he not he tell
[1:08:44] Moses why cry Moses why cry
[1:08:52] speak now I didn't say it in my heart
[1:08:56] I didn't say it in my
[1:08:58] mind confessed it with my
[1:09:00] mouth that which what I
[1:09:02] was or what I
[1:09:05] am I am a Son of
[1:09:08] God I am a minister of this
[1:09:11] gospel I am a believer in the
[1:09:13] word I am a believer in the Holy
[1:09:16] Ghost I am I am born
[1:09:19] again I believe in a prophet that God
[1:09:21] sent me a
[1:09:23] prophet been redeemed
[1:09:26] I've been restored I have reached that
[1:09:32] stature and when I said
[1:09:35] it I said Let There
[1:09:41] Be You may say oh Ronnie you haven't
[1:09:43] reached that
[1:09:46] I Abraham counted the things that were
[1:09:48] not as though they
[1:09:52] were in the beginning God created the
[1:09:55] Heaven and the Earth
[1:09:58] period and darkness was upon this
[1:10:02] Earth this Earth was
[1:10:04] void but then he came and he said let
[1:10:07] there
[1:10:08] be and there was
[1:10:13] light Let There
[1:10:15] Be he didn't say it he just showed me
[1:10:19] what to
[1:10:21] say I confessed it with my
[1:10:24] mouth Let There Be joy happiness
[1:10:29] peace I said let there
[1:10:31] be and there
[1:10:34] is that's what we have been told to
[1:10:36] confess
[1:10:39] it confess it let there be and go
[1:10:44] forward now there was a
[1:10:47] doctor he was a
[1:10:50] neuroscientist at the Thomas Jefferson
[1:10:52] University Thomas Jefferson him and
[1:10:55] Communications
[1:10:57] expert they got together and they made a
[1:11:00] book this book is
[1:11:03] called words can change your
[1:11:07] brain in it they
[1:11:09] write a single word has a power to
[1:11:12] influence the expression of the genes
[1:11:16] that regulate physical and emotional
[1:11:23] stress when we use words with
[1:11:27] positivity like love and peace we can
[1:11:31] alter how the brain
[1:11:33] functions by increasing cognitive
[1:11:38] reasoning and strengthening the areas in
[1:11:40] our frontal loes right
[1:11:45] in using positive words may often more
[1:11:48] often than negative
[1:11:52] ones can Kickstart the motivational
[1:11:54] Center of the brain propelling them into
[1:12:00] action I like this part right here I
[1:12:03] found the mistake I want to say this
[1:12:04] study was done in
[1:12:08] 2019 but this in lack of a better term I
[1:12:12] want to say this
[1:12:15] concept has been around for a long time
[1:12:19] before any scientist ever got together
[1:12:21] to to to realize this
[1:12:27] I always say this I tell customers when
[1:12:30] I talk to customers when I talk to
[1:12:33] people they say oh science disproves
[1:12:38] God no
[1:12:40] sir science proves
[1:12:45] God an expert from their
[1:12:49] book tells us how using the right words
[1:12:52] can literally change our real
[1:13:00] how using the right words can literally
[1:13:02] change our
[1:13:05] reality that's just words by
[1:13:08] man that's
[1:13:10] Science Now imagine what a word of God
[1:13:12] can
[1:13:14] do imagine what what the word of God can
[1:13:17] do if we get one promise and hold on to
[1:13:21] that just one promise
[1:13:25] I know we've heard that a
[1:13:28] lot but think about it the best way to
[1:13:32] to to uh to learn something is by
[1:13:37] repetition to hear something
[1:13:42] repetitively now
[1:13:44] watch Romans
[1:13:47] 43 for what sayith the scripture Abraham
[1:13:51] believed God and it was counted unto him
[1:13:53] for righteousness
[1:14:00] 17 as it is written I have made thee a
[1:14:03] father of many nations before him whom
[1:14:06] he believed even God who quith the dead
[1:14:09] and calleth those things which be not as
[1:14:11] though they
[1:14:19] were that's why I say this scripture
[1:14:22] proves that that concept has been around
[1:14:23] for a lot longer than
[1:14:30] so why
[1:14:31] cry speak and let there
[1:14:37] be we have the power our words have the
[1:14:40] power to create a world and go and live
[1:14:42] on
[1:14:45] it now watch
[1:14:48] words their meanings shape our beliefs
[1:15:02] Drive our
[1:15:05] behavior and
[1:15:08] ultimately creates our
[1:15:12] world amen amen now the enemy is going
[1:15:15] to come he's going to try to plant a
[1:15:16] seed inside of
[1:15:19] you he's also going to come over here
[1:15:21] with the word of
[1:15:23] God he's going to dislocate it dis
[1:15:27] represent it and he's going to come he's
[1:15:29] going to bring it to
[1:15:31] you amen
[1:15:33] amen but we have that seed that has been
[1:15:36] planted inside of us
[1:15:38] church that seed we it cannot be
[1:15:43] hybrid we can't just sit here waiting
[1:15:45] for the Lord to do some kind of a Hocus
[1:15:47] Pocus on
[1:15:50] us he gave you the power of the spoken
[1:15:52] word
[1:15:55] speak it and go
[1:15:57] forward now imagine imagine come here

[1:16:04] second the Lord
[1:16:07] says Angelo Angelo I'm going to show you
[1:16:10] how I do

[1:17:31] word you remember do you remember our
[1:17:33] founding Pastor saying that
[1:17:35] one he said God said it brother Bram
[1:17:39] says they might have taken six 6,000
[1:17:41] years for the world to
[1:17:44] come he said it and there
[1:17:48] was let there
[1:17:50] be let there be peace
[1:18:02] now there's a there's a word that hasn't
[1:18:03] been used behind our pulpit in a long
[1:18:07] time brother Mike you remember
[1:18:10] this we better be packing the
[1:18:15] goods remember
[1:18:17] that maybe a lot of your young ones
[1:18:19] maybe don't know about
[1:18:21] that but it used to be that they used to
[1:18:24] say that all the time right brother
[1:18:27] Mike I better be packing the
[1:18:31] goods you better be packing the
[1:18:34] goods amen Amen Brother Carlos you
[1:18:37] remember
[1:18:38] that because one of these days maybe our
[1:18:41] pastor's not going to be
[1:18:44] there maybe one of the ministers ain't
[1:18:46] gonna be
[1:18:47] there and he can't say for you let there
[1:18:50] be for
[1:18:52] you we have to get to that
[1:18:55] place I have to get to that place where
[1:18:58] I can say Let There
[1:19:02] be let there
[1:19:06] be amen
[1:19:12] amen you might say that's just for the
[1:19:16] minister that's our
[1:19:18] problem no it's
[1:19:21] not I'm going to repeat that again oh
[1:19:25] brother Ronnie it's just for the
[1:19:27] minister no it's
[1:19:31] not no it's
[1:19:35] not the Bible says we're Believers in
[1:19:39] the
[1:19:40] scriptures the Bible
[1:19:43] says uh let me get that for you I don't
[1:19:45] want
[1:19:46] to
[1:19:49] wrong these signs shall follow

[1:20:16] believe God put that in the
[1:20:19] church in my name they shall speak with
[1:20:21] new
[1:20:22] tongues not so much speak in
[1:20:25] tongues I'm a Believer in that the
[1:20:28] reason why I'm a Believer in speaking in
[1:20:30] tongues because God put it in the
[1:20:33] word and he never took it
[1:20:36] out never in the scriptures never in the
[1:20:39] word will you find that God took that
[1:20:42] out of the

[1:20:47] that but these signs shall follow
[1:20:49] them these sign shall follow

[1:21:10] believer God said
[1:21:12] it I believe it that settles
[1:21:16] it that's that's one that hasn't been
[1:21:18] used in a while
[1:21:21] too we must remove those words from our
[1:21:24] vocabulary
[1:21:28] defeated how many have you felt
[1:21:31] defeated
[1:21:34] worry I can't I'm
[1:21:37] horrible pardon
[1:21:40] my step away from there I
[1:21:44] suck I'm
[1:21:46] stupid I'm a
[1:21:49] I'm an
[1:21:50] idiot have you used those words
[1:21:55] every time you use that one of those
[1:21:58] words you're speaking that upon
[1:22:01] yourself and your body is going to react
[1:22:04] to what you verbally
[1:22:08] say in other words this we like to we
[1:22:12] get excited when we say oh the word of
[1:22:13] God let there
[1:22:15] be oh but I
[1:22:17] suck what you're
[1:22:19] saying let there be
[1:22:28] we must never speak that about
[1:22:31] ourselves much less our
[1:22:35] children or the brothers and the
[1:22:37] sisters did you know that negative words
[1:22:40] release stress and anxiety uh hormones
[1:22:43] in your
[1:22:49] body in Ephesians says let no corrupt
[1:22:51] communication come out of your mouth
[1:22:57] why because Satan has
[1:23:01] MAA you know what Maka
[1:23:04] is that's knowledge of former
[1:23:09] things he's a
[1:23:11] chemist he know he knows what hormones
[1:23:14] to release in your
[1:23:17] body so that those words come to
[1:23:21] you your whole body gets discouraged
[1:23:26] I I I I I know a
[1:23:29] guy when he is down he is
[1:23:33] down he totally
[1:23:35] walking I mean he talk to
[1:23:38] him hey bro how you doing hey I I'm not
[1:23:42] mocking but those words cause a whole
[1:23:45] reaction in his
[1:23:48] body I used to that was almost slipped
[1:23:51] out too I used to work with a couple of
[1:23:54] guys
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:57] one of the guys would say to the other
[1:23:59] guy he would tell me he's a run check
[1:24:02] this
[1:24:03] out God I have a
[1:24:06] headache I feel
[1:24:08] sick and he would leave it at that and
[1:24:12] the other guy that we worked
[1:24:14] with a couple hours later he would be ah
[1:24:18] I have a
[1:24:20] headache I'm going to go home and he'd
[1:24:23] be gone for the whole day
[1:24:26] one time this was even
[1:24:28] said ah I have L I can't feel like I
[1:24:32] can't
[1:24:36] talk he would say check this
[1:24:39] out an hour or two
[1:24:42] later the guy would be
[1:24:44] there he'd
[1:24:46] be I I can't
[1:24:49] talk I have blocked
[1:24:52] y our words have power
[1:24:57] there is power in
[1:24:59] words but the Bible says let this mind
[1:25:02] be in
[1:25:04] you and there it is again
[1:25:08] let you have to let this
[1:25:13] mind and after we let this mind be in
[1:25:18] US it says I can do all things through
[1:25:22] Christ which strengthens me
[1:25:28] I don't know what time I started that
[1:25:30] okay better start weighing down because
[1:25:33] yeah through faith we understand that
[1:25:35] the word of God the the worlds were
[1:25:38] framed by the word of
[1:25:42] God how were they
[1:25:44] framed by Let There
[1:25:47] Be he simply
[1:25:49] said let there be and we know that the
[1:25:53] world were framed by the word of
[1:25:59] God so I'm going to I'm going to end
[1:26:01] with this okay because I'm not sure what
[1:26:02] time I started
[1:26:05] at so I I went I went I preached that
[1:26:08] the last
[1:26:10] time after after I went to in the shower
[1:26:13] after I spoke
[1:26:16] that I've been a new
[1:26:19] person my my mind and my mentality it's
[1:26:22] it's completely different
[1:26:25] but what what God did through my
[1:26:30] word I I believed my
[1:26:33] word and and it was
[1:26:35] so God said let there be
[1:26:39] light and there
[1:26:41] was I spoke it and there
[1:26:46] was if you if you're in need of
[1:26:50] something whatever it may
[1:26:52] be we've heard heard a lot of word in
[1:26:55] this
[1:26:56] place you know the
[1:26:59] word Let There Be speak it let there
[1:27:05] be sick we're GNA get sick
[1:27:11] again but the healing of the spirit and
[1:27:13] of the
[1:27:15] Soul when God comes and changes
[1:27:19] that it's it's different I may get sick
[1:27:24] CO's going around like wild
[1:27:27] fire I may get
[1:27:29] sick but my spirit and my soul there
[1:27:34] different I'm I'm I'm a different than
[1:27:36] what what I
[1:27:38] was not because uh I was going to speak
[1:27:42] something negative about
[1:27:45] myself not so not so much because I'm a
[1:27:47] great
[1:27:48] man or a great
[1:27:51] person but I believe in a great God
[1:27:55] and greater is he that is in
[1:27:57] me than than he that is in the world
[1:28:00] greater is he that is in me than he who
[1:28:02] can destroy this
[1:28:08] body so my my my family and I we were in
[1:28:11] a we went to uh leberg
[1:28:15] Canyon leberg Slot Canyon leberg Canyon
[1:28:19] anybody heard of that one it's a good
[1:28:21] one you got you all got to go visit one
[1:28:22] of these days there there slot can and
[1:28:24] then there's lebur Slot Canyon two
[1:28:25] different
[1:28:27] ones so as we're walking down this
[1:28:29] Canyon we were having a great
[1:28:32] time kids were laughing we were laughing
[1:28:35] we were being loud we were talking it
[1:28:36] was we had a great
[1:28:39] time and as we're walking down this
[1:28:42] Canyon I for I I would see some
[1:28:44] droppings of a
[1:28:47] predator I didn't say nothing about it I
[1:28:50] mean here I am every time I go out in
[1:28:51] the woods I always have my sidearm with
[1:28:53] me
[1:28:58] I wasn't scared because I had my
[1:29:00] gun you know so so we're walking a
[1:29:03] little bit more and there was
[1:29:05] more walk a little bit more and there
[1:29:07] was
[1:29:09] more and walking a little bit more and
[1:29:11] there was one that
[1:29:13] was
[1:29:16] fresh so I so I I told Grace and the
[1:29:18] kids I was like man that that one's
[1:29:20] fresh right
[1:29:22] there Dad let's go back Dad Dad let's
[1:29:25] go Dad let's go Ronnie was Ronnie we
[1:29:29] better
[1:29:33] go my son Nathan we had just barely took
[1:29:35] his boot off remember he had broken
[1:29:40] ankle she's like oh yeah he's like
[1:29:42] they're going to go the Predators is
[1:29:43] gonna go for the easiest
[1:29:47] one and that's
[1:29:49] true so we're having a good
[1:29:52] time I I told my my family is you know
[1:29:54] what don't even worry about
[1:29:56] it we're laughing we're having a great
[1:30:00] time it's going to hear us before it
[1:30:02] sees
[1:30:05] us and trust me it's more scared of you
[1:30:07] than you are of
[1:30:10] it Dad let's go Dad let's
[1:30:13] go let's get out of
[1:30:15] here I was said no it's
[1:30:17] fine we walked and there it
[1:30:20] is looking right at
[1:30:22] us David freaks
[1:30:26] out he's Dad let's go and take
[1:30:31] our don't
[1:30:32] worry you see how it
[1:30:35] ran it's more scared of us than we are
[1:30:38] of
[1:30:41] it and besides I I have my
[1:30:44] gun but I won't have to use my
[1:30:47] gun because it's scared of our
[1:30:52] voice so now watch the lord gave me
[1:30:56] something on
[1:30:57] that when the person is out the predator
[1:30:59] hunting you'll know about
[1:31:03] this when you're when you're hunting for
[1:31:07] Predators you have an electronic call
[1:31:09] and you can put it out there and the
[1:31:11] electronic
[1:31:15] call you turn the sound on and you put
[1:31:17] on the sound of a distressed animal
[1:31:25] whether it be a
[1:31:27] deer a rabbit a bird whatever it may
[1:31:31] be the Predator hears the sound of
[1:31:37] distress and the Predator
[1:31:40] comes because now that's
[1:31:43] natural now
[1:31:46] spiritually the the devil is like a
[1:31:49] roaring lion
[1:31:53] not a lion he's like a roaring
[1:31:57] lion and a lion is a
[1:31:59] predator and a lion is an apex
[1:32:05] predator so when they hear that
[1:32:08] sound the sound of
[1:32:11] distress they come running for a free
[1:32:13] meal easy
[1:32:15] meal and the Lord
[1:32:17] says when you're negative that's how you
[1:32:21] sound that's a that's like a gut punch
[1:32:24] to
[1:32:26] me when you're negative that's how you
[1:32:30] sound when you see things that maybe you
[1:32:33] shouldn't be
[1:32:36] seen no I'm not talking about
[1:32:39] poras but maybe we see things that
[1:32:43] happen we dislike
[1:32:46] it maybe we talk about
[1:32:49] it that's a sound of distress
[1:32:54] maybe something happens to us a predator
[1:32:57] also likes the sound of a baby
[1:33:01] rabbit and they'll come to
[1:33:04] devour so a lot of times when we're
[1:33:06] complaining we sound like a
[1:33:11] baby
[1:33:13] right and the Predator the enemy he
[1:33:16] loves
[1:33:18] that he loves the sounds of
[1:33:22] distress he loves the sound of your
[1:33:26] complaining let me rephrase that he
[1:33:29] loves the sound of my
[1:33:33] complaining he loves the sounds of my
[1:33:36] distress that's why in the highs and the
[1:33:38] lows of
[1:33:41] David David never stopped giving praise
[1:33:43] even in his highs and his
[1:33:47] lows and in you is given the
[1:33:52] power of the spoken
[1:33:54] word now the enemy is scared of the
[1:33:59] voice because the Predator is a scared
[1:34:02] of your
[1:34:05] voice amen amen he's a predator scared
[1:34:08] of your voice if you know
[1:34:10] that a bear is scared of your voice a
[1:34:12] mount Lions he's scared of your
[1:34:16] voice most of the time anyway
[1:34:24] we
[1:34:27] we we better stop the
[1:34:32] distress the Lord has changed my
[1:34:35] heart every time I I I I hear something
[1:34:39] like
[1:34:40] that I cut the thing
[1:34:44] off whether it be a phone
[1:34:47] call whatever it may be I got to
[1:34:52] go I will I I will no
[1:34:55] longer I will no
[1:34:58] longer stop to hear the
[1:35:02] negativity the Predator loves that
[1:35:07] sound he'll come to devour
[1:35:10] you stop
[1:35:13] that I have to stop
[1:35:16] that and we have we have to stop it and
[1:35:20] we have to say
[1:35:21] Lord joy peace happiness
[1:35:27] Let There
[1:35:34] Be I was going to say something else but
[1:35:36] I'm I'm gonna stop that right
[1:35:38] there I feel the spirit of the Lord
[1:35:40] stopping right
[1:35:44] there let there
[1:35:48] be you're going through a hard
[1:35:52] time let there be
[1:35:55] speak the word let there
[1:35:58] be the enemy is is scared of your
[1:36:02] voice you may have the
[1:36:06] power like I had my
[1:36:08] 40 I had my gun I had the power to
[1:36:12] defeat the
[1:36:14] enemy but I didn't need
[1:36:16] it simply the most powerful weapon that
[1:36:20] God has ever given you
[1:36:23] he could have defeated the devil with
[1:36:25] his power
[1:36:28] immediately he simply
[1:36:32] spoke let there
[1:36:34] be let there be he's more scared of your
[1:36:38] voice your voice of
[1:36:41] Praise than anything
[1:36:43] else God bless you
[1:37:09] God bless you brother Ronnie brother

[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:57] and God bless his word once
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:09] again God bless our brother Ronnie for
[1:49:11] the beautiful word
[1:49:13] amen Ronnie
[1:49:20] Jerry you may be seated
[1:49:24] just real quick brother brother
[1:49:40] Fidel God bless God bless
[1:49:44] you I asked for five
[1:49:47] minutes uh Thanksgiving to the
[1:49:51] Lord for uh my beautiful
[1:49:57] wife uh just a couple days ago we were
[1:49:59] we've been married 30
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:08] years and something that the lord gave
[1:50:11] gave to me in my
[1:50:14] heart it's gonna sound funny but
[1:50:18] it's because uh it's
[1:50:25] yeah she thought that I wasn't going to
[1:50:26] give her any attention the other
[1:50:28] day we finished
[1:50:33] working and the Lord inspired my
[1:50:37] heart to go out and eat a
[1:50:40] hamburger
[1:50:42] hamburger but the best
[1:50:46] thing was a good
[1:50:50] time because the Lord guided me to do it
[1:50:52] that
[1:50:54] way maybe I could have taken her out to
[1:50:57] a lovely
[1:51:00] dinner because the children of God have
[1:51:03] to do all of
[1:51:06] that I consider myself like Adam when he
[1:51:09] would go and maybe get something from
[1:51:10] the tree maybe cut it out cut it
[1:51:14] down and whatever he cut down it would
[1:51:17] reappear uh I think that's the way my
[1:51:20] economy I just go out and I extend my
[1:51:23] hand and there it
[1:51:26] is and I could have had for a very good
[1:51:31] dinner
[1:51:34] uh uh maybe a a beautiful
[1:51:36] dress but you know
[1:51:42] what because it's been 30
[1:51:46] years 24 years here in the United States
[1:51:52] not just anybody could have supported
[1:51:54] what you had
[1:51:59] done let us look
[1:52:03] sisters it is it's hard to support your
[1:52:06] your
[1:52:08] husband um sometimes our husbands were
[1:52:12] uh not careful with
[1:52:14] her that uh that if it wasn't for them I
[1:52:18] don't just say it for
[1:52:21] myself I wouldn't be able to do what the
[1:52:23] Lord has inspired me to do here
[1:52:27] her she was uh something fundamental in
[1:52:31] my
[1:52:33] life to complete what the Lord has has
[1:52:36] me here to
[1:52:38] do and you know what that
[1:52:41] was but thank the
[1:52:45] Lord and God is going to reward you you
[1:52:48] know
[1:52:49] why because your mother passed away
[1:52:54] you you were not able to
[1:52:55] go but I'm going to tell you
[1:53:00] here you're going to be one of the the
[1:53:02] the persons in your
[1:53:04] family that you're going to be able to
[1:53:06] see your mother
[1:53:08] again that
[1:53:10] is what is God that's what God is going
[1:53:13] to do with
[1:53:14] you I just want to tell you
[1:53:17] this for all you that are
[1:53:20] married uh
[1:53:23] uh OB observe your
[1:53:26] wife because a lot of times God wants to
[1:53:29] say
[1:53:30] a have you con have you considered what
[1:53:32] I have given
[1:53:34] you and when you can look at them with
[1:53:37] the eyes of
[1:53:39] God it is the thing that is more be the
[1:53:43] most beautiful thing you know
[1:53:46] why because after your
[1:53:49] salvation he gives us the very best
[1:53:53] God bless
[1:54:02] you amen God bless brother Fidel

[1:54:10] that 30

[1:54:19] Foundation

[1:54:24] and give you more
