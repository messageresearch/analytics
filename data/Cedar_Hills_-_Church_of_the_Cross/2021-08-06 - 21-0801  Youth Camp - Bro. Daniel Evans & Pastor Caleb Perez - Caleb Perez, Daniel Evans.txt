========================================

so this morning we have a chance kill that boy that's in there and now you're gonna fill that void that's there all right friends i i i've been just relaxed for those that weren't here last night we uh we gave some testimonies and uh we were talking about we're talking about brother branham and the different things that that that the lord did through him and and i was able to share some testimonies that came to my family and with my family way back when they were close with both rand and his family and when we talked about those things and i was i woke up this morning and these minister brothers will know what i mean when i say this that that very long day okay all right it was what i said was that is that easy to do and uh i want to read a scripture really fast in saint john chapter 21. and this this scripture came in my heart this morning i remember john as a disciple john was with jesus and john through his his testimony he gave testimonies of the things that happened and he said this he said this disciple which testifies at these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true and this is the part that i love so much brother because this is the ministry that i was talking about last night and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written everyone i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written amen that's what we [Applause] witnessed one here none of you were there when these things happen i talked about last night and like uh and for those that weren't here i talked about last night i talked about joshua going over jordan and when he went over he had these men and they picked up these stones and they stacked these stones up and joshua commanded he said you bring your children back to these stones can you see see these stones right here let me tell you the story behind these stones and i wanted this camp camp thunderbird i wanted these young people the lord and terry that you could be your children back to this place yes yes and you can see this place right here this is where i received the holy spirit this is where i dedicated my life to the lord this is where your mother or your dad this is those choices yeah and friends you're going to have an opportunity today i'm going to give a testimony at the end of the service and i said last night it's the greatest experience that i've ever had in my lifetime and i'm going to talk about someone that made a choice same choice that every single one of you has today everyone and i want to talk about this choice that this brother had and whether he made the right choice he made the wrong choice but as i was as i said that last night some of the sisters came to me afterwards and on fire and they said he said hey uh you know you said that you saw the dead race remember when i said that i was like yeah they said you want to hear this story i'll tell you what i'll tell that testimony before we get started um in the morning of service so here we are and uh i want to tell that story some of you have probably heard of heard about it i was in service and at the at the tabernacle we have we have um when i was when i was going to the tabernacle we were meeting in in a big auditory because there's too many people to fit in the church itself people get there really early for church because you wanted to you want to get in the he'd always be the firstborn there well he came to church he was the first one there so so he gets in there he sits way over in the corner like maybe where his brother is over here maybe maybe back there somewhere nobody saw him but he was over there by himself and before service started he made a strange sound it sounded like a storm and the brother behind him noticed it and what had happened when he made that sentence his heart stopped he passed away there and he wasn't noticed for a while but what had happened is when you die all of you lose all of your muscle um your ability and and it's now doping and all the jewel came down on his chest of course your your kidneys move your bowels move you die there's there's nothing no wife in here the uh the sister as a nurse she was sitting a couple of people down from him she noticed me and my brother in the flesh he's a paramedic and he's in charge of anytime there's any type of medical issue at the tabernacle at stillwater's youth camp or a course of god recordings he's in charge because of his experience in handling these emergency situations he went over there and and the brother was hunched down in his chair and he was little leaning over and i was i was about from here to uh the brother in the in there and i was looking down down the road there and my brother came and we have a trauma surgeon in a church his name is matt gold and brother matt also he's whenever he sees my brother get up for the mat he'll get up too because of jen's ability his doctor he followed my brother my brother noticed he was dead and to tell myself there was a presence there it wasn't like an emotional presence but i looked down and i saw he was obviously dead and i got excited and i told my wife i said he's dead and my wife later on she says don't embarrassed me you were so wild and you said that but but but he was and i knew it but i knew what was gonna happen there was something in him that i knew so so my brother gets down and he kneels down and puts his hand on his on his chest he opens up his shirt he puts his hand on his chest and the lord spoke to my brother and he said make sure he's dead because you will be giving this testimony later on wow my brother had his hands on chest the trauma surgeon brother matt was standing behind like this and and he had his hand trying to get a pulse no false there's another brother and he was trying to get a pulse behind his way brother joseph random was at the pulpit brother joseph came down we were taking the offering wow when this happened and then the plate was going by we were singing it was presents and like i said it wasn't emotional we just knew joseph came comes down he kneels down my brother's hands we're on about james's chest man slice his hand underneath my brothers and i'm praying that i look up and look to my left just in time to see facebook pray for saw his mouth closed his eyes were open before his eyes closed and blinked but the mat was standing behind and and his pulse my brother had his his hands on his chest and his chest raised up wow he took a breath my brother looked up at her back and he says i have i have a i have respiration but a man says i've got a pulse he trained trained medical people no cpr no nothing so his heart started being the brother the brother came back too so that they took him to the hospital after that took him outside they took him to the hospital and brother matt the surgeon went with brother james and the doctors checked them out up and down everything they didn't even find any damage to his heart but they found one thing it was very odd his temperature is four degrees below normal it's a lot his temperature was four degrees below normal but that started doing math as a doctor when you die you have some room temperature and your temperature starts to go down wow wow those four degrees were consistent with an hour and a half wow that he was dead which is consistent with all the testimonies of the grudge so so yes my sister i saw a dead man with that experience that i had at stillwater's youth camp that i'll talk about in a little while and it's it's for you and talking with you all today there's we're all in tough situations when you're making decisions right now you're making decisions that are going to affect you for the rest of your life more than any time in your life the decisions that you all are making now are going to affect you for years and years and there's there's two forces working on you right now okay i'm me too standing in the pocket they're working on you right now but it was the force that is trying to get you to have communion and fellowship with the lord jesus there's that verse that's god himself he wants that fellowship with him that's why we're here that's why we have a youth camp that's why we have our pastor here all right brother caleb well caleb's job as a pastor is not to bring you to him it's not to bring you to church it's not even it's not even it's not to bring you to brother branham's message it's not even to bring you to this bible because you can read this bible and not understand it our job is to bring you to the lord jesus and to get you to have that fellowship with him that relationship with him and if you have that relationship with him you'll be fine you'll sin you'll mess up you'll do things wrong yeah you will we all do all of us do but once you have that relationship with the lord jesus that's what your parents want that's why they tell you don't do this don't do that don't do this you know it's like oh i'm not allowed to do anything can we not do anything don't worry they want you to have that relationship and friends win with me i do anything i want when you experience that change you don't want to sin anymore you still do you still mess up but there's a point to come that you don't you want you want to do things that are pleasing to the lord i love to there's things that i love to do you know i love to go hunting i love to go fishing i love to i love to work on my car i don't like to work on my car that much but i like to clean my car i like to wash my car let me put it down i like to do that those are things that are those things pleasing to the lord yet they're good but the lord knows he he's my son he likes to do these things you know and i do and i like to do those things and there'll be things that you all like to do but then there's another delicious boy and instead of like tommy and caleb that are trying to get you to christ there's another force and this force is trying to break that relationship that force is trying to step in the middle of that relationship two forces and you can always identify them pretty soon we're going to read a scripture but we can always identify those two forces is this force over here is this getting me closer to god or is it pulling me away i'm not allowed and we talk about our friends and we talk about we talk about these things that you young people go on these forces they're so strong on you you boys the first force that attacks you is girls is these worldly girls going to school you know and they're so nice you know and and the boys attacked the girls too but man this is a pull on the young men and they try and and here it is presented in a way you know and then you girls there's this force that's pulling on you it's like don't you don't look like that try to look like everybody else and then you get into my mind why do i have to look different why do i have to be different well what what is it and then there's a pull on you to look like look like these other kids that you know let's go to school with whatever and there's there's these different forces that pull on us and in brother brown's message that we studied in preparation for this camp is your life worthy of the gospel how many times and there's a few that had uh on the pages i love that there's a few that had that that read the quote that brother graham says you have to have that personal relationship with jesus and he talks about that throughout that message and that's everything it's it's everything to us it's the most important thing in the world the enemy wants to break down i was a very other families very close people i think the world they uh married a couple of kids they ended up getting on the websites known that they're critical of us of what we believe and there's things on there that they're reading and they end up saying listen brother brown's a false problems wow wrong we don't believe them anymore and and we're out of this so they moved to california southern california i could go into the influence there now i'll say right now they have a daughter it's in fourth grade and her friends are coming out of the closet you know i mean wow fourth grade and and and and they're saying these girls are saying i have a crush on you and then this other girl that's like these girls they're being told that they're being influenced they're being [Music] right looking feminine it's not about how long your skirt is it's not about your hair god knew what this world was going to and he said don't do that don't even don't don't get anywhere close to that stay away from it because look it's going to lead to this and we have arrived i'm going to say well i identify as this i identify as that i identify as a christian [Applause] i'm part of you i'm part of all right amen you sisters you walk out there with your hair and and the way that you look and you represent the lord jesus i don't i don't i don't do these things i don't date these girls you brothers are a good representation of the lord jesus christ in this day who's that [Applause] so i felt in my heart to don't miss these friends so i go and and i uh they're so sweet they're just great and we're talking and fellowshipping and just just just enjoying each other's company and i i told my sister about him my job i've worked i said i spent the past 14 years of my life answering questions answering questions about program's message answering questions about the bible people would call in and then they'd get a track and they'd call and they'd say now who is this william branham answering those type of questions even if i i've had questions about this one sister called she was so upset because she accidentally washed her husband's prayer cloth and she didn't know what to do and she said is that a problem with it you know i accidentally watched it it was painless no problem it's all these questions one of the questions that would come in was his brother ran on a false problem because of this evidence this evidence accepted himself and i told him i said no ask me any of these questions that you have so they had a conversation and this conversation most of the questions i could answer some i could and i said i don't know and at the end of the conversation it was so nice it was such a good conversation in the conversation they said to me they said we went to the pastor of the church and we asked him these questions and he said just believe it don't question it just believe it just just just don't even look at it don't even look at that stuff just believe it that didn't work they asked their parents parents said the same thing just believe it just don't question it just just don't just stay away from that stuff and they told me they said they were afraid about these things about brother branham they were afraid of them and they said but daniel you're not afraid how come you're not afraid i'm the only one we know that's not afraid about these things that we're saying i'm not and i told him i said these words i don't even care about these things so then they left and i i went to my room and and and started praying is there something wrong because all these things that they were saying some things i can't explain but i don't care i really doesn't bother me these things that they're saying about brother brown doesn't affect me straight i'm not the bad prank about it then i woke up and i was still praying and then the lord spoke and he said he said this he said william brandt a message is a success in your life my life because he introduced you to me these ministers these deacons these trustees we have these brothers and moms you know these these blessed people that pray for you that's their ultimate goal that's the success of brother brown's nest is that you would know jesus and that you would have that fellowship now we get to my favorite part of the service let's turn to genesis chapter chapter 3. this is my favorite part of the service friends because i could say something wrong but if we read this bible bible friends it's so important god wrote this bible yes when you open this bible when you look into these words you're looking into the very face of god yes this is what he has preserved for us remember my little analogy yesterday of google maps and you take the little guy and drop him in we're going to drop ourselves right here into this bible don't neglect it one of the brothers said let's go to kayla when we were out by the bonfire out there when he was doing the pages but caleb said he said he was okay we said don't just read over these things don't just read over these pages just to get through them friends when you read this bible make sure you know what's going on when you read a scripture verse don't just read it to get get through it stop on that verse if you don't understand it pray about it study it get to understand this by the grace of god we understand what genesis chapter 3 is amen very very important if you've heard you've heard of the serpent seed circumcising doctrine yeah yeah i mean we know what it is we've we've had this revelation in the end but friends there's a deeper meaning behind the serpent-seat doctrine that we should never forget it's not just the relationship it's that satan came in to break that relationship between adam and eve and the lord start with verse one now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said to the woman yea have god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest he die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not assure god for god doesn't know that in the day that you meet there then your eyes shall be opened you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and then when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and was buzzing to the eyes and treated me desire to make one wise she took up the fruit thereof indeed and gave also unto her husband with her he didn't in the eyes of both of them were open and they knew they were naked and they threw biglies together and made themselves what a way to begin this book it's like god is showing us there's forces against you all right let me ask somebody a question we did some questions and answer dating candy and stuff let me uh let me ask you a question my question very important all right you ready really is really important okay can you get it look at genesis all right really what's next [Applause] this is this is metaphorically written for all intents and purposes this was a man a snake's camp doesn't make sense this was a man that came and what did he do we have to we have to set the stage here we have adam and eve adam and eve were young people they were like you all wow don't forget they were there we go they're they're the same situation you all are in right now wow and they're there and they're in this beautiful place and god had got it made this place for them and then given the bible says dominion over the whole thing it's like here's this wonderful place that you can live where you have everything that you need he says but just don't do this one thing all right just stay away from worldly fats just stay away from this stuff stay away from this other stuff but everything else you haven't enjoy yourself and here is god and he has his son and his daughter and he's so proud man he's up there and he's like yes i'm a boy you know he's look at him you know he's just like me you know i love this guy while there's my girl you know and she's so sweet look at her look at how nice she looks how pretty she is you know just like him with our kids and there's god and he's doing that he loves him so much and he wants them to be happy and he wants you to be happy he wants you to prosper he wants you to enjoy your life the best way to enjoy your life is to have that relationship with god god said you can do anything right maybe something like well you know you know they just don't want you to have a problem and there's this tree over here and it's just all right and i'm speaking metaphorically now he says there's this tree over there how about how about this and uh he's like so you know oh but you know it'll be fun it'll be great you know this will be really cool you know and we'll sneak out your parents and parents won't notice they're not going to find out there's a voice and his ultimate goal this liar he wanted to take you away from the lord he wanted to take your happiness away and all of these parents all of these elders in the church they will tell you i made this mistake and i suffered for it you've seen it i've seen it i made this mistake i suffered for it i wish i wouldn't have done it how many times did he say i wish i wouldn't have done it but it seemed so good when it happened there they are satan comes in and has breaks god's heart he's fearless and his son now now they've broken everything they've ruined everything now they're going to suffer for the rest of their lives because of this one sin that they did doesn't mean they were lost that's the thing that we forget about just because we sin doesn't mean we're lost it just means that we have to suffer all right yeah remember this we sin in the flesh and we're going to suffer in the flesh but your eternal destination does not change where you are going that was predestinated for ordained a long time ago but how you get there is up to you and you can have a hard life that's full of trouble or have a good life you know so often you know as young people when you think that you think maybe i'm lost or or whatever it is and friends let me tell you as long as there's a desire yes amen to serve the lord you know and and we preach about hell hell is real yeah but as long as there's a desire in your heart to serve god okay don't make mistakes you'll suffer from mistakes but you're okay but when that desire is not now if you don't have a desire that's right to serve the lord then hell is very real and hell will be that destination and it is not where you want to go i think everybody here i think we have that desire to serve our world in our hearts so then we we see that and we see that god he will send he will send gifts into our lives and these gifts you know we think about gifts in church we think about speaking in tongues and prophecy and healing and these things but don't neglect the gifts very important gifts that we have parents every one of you is a gift yeah to each other if you're helping your friends be a gift yes don't be disturbed you be a gift your parents are gifts to you when they point you to the lord jesus your pastor is a gift to you church is a gift this camp is a gift to all right now we can say i don't want your gifts say that and i believe you'll still be saved because you'll have a heart i don't want your guests i'm gonna go to church i don't want it okay all right your destination is gonna be the same but i would recommend that you take those gifts you utilize utilize those gifts yes because god gave them to us there's a uh those those gifts for one purpose and what they are we need you to have that relationship jesus there's a scripture that i came across let me turn to it real quick it's in mark 227 did i read your bible i love it yeah mark 227 when i came across the scripture i didn't i didn't understand it it was strange to me what happened was uh yeah that's it so what happened was jesus had his disciples and they were out and and they were hungry on the sabbath it would be like sunday for us is it saturday back then they were hungry so they walked into the field and anytime that you see corn in the bible you know you see corn it's not like it's not necessarily like corn like we know it's any kind of grain kind of that grows on an ear okay so so they were out and they they were they were in the fields and they were hungry on the sabbath day so they go out and and when the the grain is ripe what you can do is you can pick it you can rub it in your hands and and like the shuck comes off and then it just leaves the seed there and you gotta blow it and then you have just the seed they get they were eating they're doing that and the accuser the pharisees they said hey what are you guys doing they said they said you're doing this on the sabbath this isn't lawful and jesus's answer perplexed me the answer and and he could have answered according to what the word says and the word says that in the old testament that yeah you can go into the fields and you can do this but you can't take any out of the field because that would be worth but on sunday or on the sabbath yeah you can go do that but jesus didn't answer that way it was very odd the way he answered he answered this way he said in verse 27 he said the sabbath was made for man and not man amen what an odd answer no you know what that means but what are strange things great about that lord why is that why would jesus answer in such a way that he could have answered with the word he could have gone back to the book of deuteronomy and said look here's here's the law no we're good we didn't he said the sabbath was created for the man for man and not man from the sabbath let me relate it to the church okay church isn't a place to beat us over the head and say come to church come to church come to church come to church no that's not what church is for they're for us they're gifts to us listening to tapes don't compound you gotta listen to you you're not a believer this is no no no no these tapes are made for us i can listen to them whenever i want i can say lord i don't want your gifts or i can listen to him i can take it in for me god gave it to me and the sabbath god knew that if he didn't set aside that seventh day that people would just be people and they wouldn't set aside a day of worship but yet so he said we'll do better if you set aside this day and he put it in the law and they did it and jesus said no this was made for us this was a gift to us and that's that's these things that they are the gifts to us make life a little bit easier for us to get us to the lord jesus and new york one more scripture that i want to read and then i want to give my testimony what happened it's in saint john chapter 14. now now what happened here in saint john jesus is coming to the end of his life with his disciples had what's called the last supper you know you know what the last supper is when jesus betrayed him what about if you were in his body he was a man he was god but he was god made flesh that's right so he was in the same flesh that we are he had the same feelings that we feel so he can relate to us he was down he knew his time was coming and he was like i'm gonna go away and how sad the lord must have been i'm gonna go away but then he says but wait wow things are gonna be better when i go away but but things are going to be better because i'm going to do something that's going to it's going to just it's going to make it all better i'm going to go away and they went from the last supper and they were walking down in jerusalem i've been there and and the city is built on a hill there's a valley a little valley that goes down the garden of gethsemane yosemite is down towards the bottom of the valley and it's really short you can you can walk there and anywhere from depending on where you are in the city for 15 to 30 minutes so so he's walking along this trail and he's talking to his disciples and he's telling them i'm going to leave but but things are going to change and and i'm going to do this and let's let's turn to verse 26. he says this now remember the situation he says but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said to you and she was talking about this mysterious thing that he calls the tunnel in other translations it's called the advocate we know it as the holy spirit and he's saying that i'm going to send this and i love you so much and i want to be part of you and and and and i just want i want to i want to always be together and you all always love one another amen and i'm talking to the parents now yes you all yes love one another yes i will know that you are my disciples by not separate churches not separate doctrines all those doctrines and all that this is the most important i'll know you because you love one another because you're together in love yeah say man and he tells me he warms them and jesus's heart is tearing out of him because he knows he's about to go to the cross and he says love one another and don't stray and he says but i'm gonna sin i'm gonna die i'm gonna go to the cross and you know what so are you you're gonna suffer the same fate that i did but don't forget this comforter is coming this this one is coming and he's gonna be so close to you that he's going to be inside of you not a friend that we can hold hands but he's going to be so close he's going to be inside of him and he will never leave you [Applause] and then jesus goes to the cross and we see the day of pentecost we see that happening just the way jesus said it but jesus promised it not for just his disciples he promised it for us he even prayed he said lord not just for these only but for all of those that are going to hear my testimony through their lips which is us yeah that's rude amen and he wants us to receive that holy spirit but then a little while later we see divisions start to happen [Music] but in first corinthians chapter one paul says he says there's divisions you know you say that i i believe i believe brother brother caleb and you say i believe brother joseph and they say i believe for the biscuit he's like don't do that he says he says was this person baptized were you baptized in his name he said don't do that paul's soul wanted us to go back to that day of pentecost where he had the holy spirit is so bad but that wasn't for paul to do it paul's job was not to turn the hearts of the john back to that of the god that was to come later and we have arrived and we must receive that same holy spirit malachi 4 says to turn the hearts of the children back to the day of pentecost back to the pentecostal fathers back to the fathers we know from brother branham that it's a pentecostal father it's a day of pentecost we have to receive the holy spirit there's a boy there and that void must be filled with that same jesus christ that walked in the shores of galilee and it's here for us that's right friends i talked about the stones of joshua yeah yeah and let it be this place when i was at stillwater's camp there was a young brother named carlos carlos came to camp and his parents made him though he didn't want to go you know he had his friends and and you know when i he was in my cabin and i said hey man i said what do you expect from cam and the first day and he's like he's like well he goes on okay you know so i see carlos throughout the camp and he's like yeah you know this is funny yeah you're having a good time oh yeah you know archery was good i liked it you know quiet time but oh yeah yeah i fell asleep you know that's good you know i was like yeah and at least you guys honest with me you know also so we go along and man carlos has nothing there is nothing there in this kid no desire at all in this young man i was like i'm a failure you know and i was like man what can i do what can i say to this this kid and then you know and tried to talk to him he said you know i'm not into that all right you know okay what can i do for you you know it's water you know you don't need to ride somewhere i may even take me over here you know okay let's play paintball all right play baseball you don't want to go over there [Music] so then carlos was in the same position it was a sunday morning series friday morning there but it was like this service like last night today really it was a nice service and carlos is sitting there he's looking down and and i'm up and i'm watching carlos went down there looking down nothing so we closed the service i come to the pulpit brother joseph leaves and still waters laid out where you have is just like this we have an area where you eat and then there's a lake and everybody after the service they go over to the other side of the lake for the baptism there's always young people being baptized so so we closed the service and everybody left and they were waiting to for like like you brothers and sisters back here you're waiting for me to get finished so you can get everything ready to eat and they were back there waiting everybody left and they went over to the other side of the lake for the baptismal and carlos is still sitting there oh wow yeah and uh so everybody leaves still sitting there any longer you know hanging down his face so i go down and i sit down next to him and the brother says he says hey we gotta change the get ready for lunch and we had a tent set up like a canvas wall tent set up a little ways away that that we could go and pray and i told carlos over here he goes over there and we're sitting there carlos is sitting in the chair

never seen this and there was there's pine trees he said look at these trees he says these trees look at the leaves on the trees he said look at the sky he says i've never seen anything like this the joy that came into the into his heart had changed everything and he saw the holy spirit there and it had such joy john who i've been talking about said he said do these things that your joy may be full he wants us to be happy he wants us to receive that holy spirit and he did that day did he stop sinning no did he stop struggling no but something changed and we have that opportunity now you stood last night when you said that you wanted it that was a very very important thing carlos leaned forward he said i'll do it that's when it came in now we have the opportunity let's stand we have the opportunity for this to happen here in this place with our heads and think about the things that we've heard we think about the stones the rocks that joshua piled up and we have the same opportunity now friends that carlos act and i ask people in just a moment [Music] you can't earn your way to heaven you can't earn the holy spirit but we have something to do we have a decision to make friends [Music] this decision each one of you knows what it is the lord deals with us individually we have a relationship with him have that decision in your heart friends will that same holy spirit that came down in that tent that day the most powerful presence i could ever even imagine being here now [Music] that my brother made that day i pray that you will let's make your last chance to do it [Music] and then we will see our hearts being turned back [Music] you're so precious and just such good kids [Music] lord would you come down would you put your arms around them would you just hold them close to your bosom as as your son prayed that they would receive this comforter but friend you have to make a decision he's standing at the door and he's knocking the door in yours our grave and mighty god [Music] lord god there's there's young people here that they have their hands raised they have their hearts open lord they're willing to make a decision father helped them and made that same holy spirit that fell in that tent that day lord god made it fall upon him and father may they be able to come back to this place and say these stones this is where i receive the holy spirit this is where it happened to me this is where i made my decision this was my decision i came back to this place this happened to me here father may they be able to say that all right and lord may you have the three of them in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ [Music] remember a dream that brother branham tells concerning a a giant great big man with big muscles and he had this stick in his hand then he's a three-pronged stick there was a woman that he was he kept beating on and every time she tried to get up you beat on her as i was thinking about that brother branham says i was afraid that i saw he was a huge man and i was afraid how could me as such a small man tell him something but you know when the holy spirit comes yeah it began to anoint you to do a service for him he said all of a sudden he got tired of seeing that woman hit time and time again and he looked at the man and said stop it are you hearing me this morning stop it he said about that time the man began to shrink brother brown says my faith muscles [Applause] now say that because as i was thinking about your young people i know that you all get to a certain place in your walk with the lord and it seems like there's a giant there that always as soon as you start to rise up and feel good and i'm gonna serve the lord and that giant comes right down and boom knocks you back down again am i talking to anybody here does that happen to you yes sir come on am i talking to some parents is that right and every time we try to rise up as the church of the living god here comes that stick again that giant boom and he hits you knocks you back down and you're like i thought i was getting somewhere with the lord and i thought about that and the lord told me right before i came he says you tell them to stand whoever wants your giant to shrink this is what he told me he said you tell them that they're giants whatever has been bothering them their giant is about to shriek [Applause] whatever giant has been bothering you hitting you i want you to think of what it is the greatest giant you have in your life right now [Music] come on [Applause] [Music] i'm tired of you beating on me [Applause] i tell you that your giant will [Applause] [Applause] [Music] there's a giant messing with your neighbor brother branham says that that man that was the husband and that three strong stick was the trinity he was trying he was beating that woman with that oh but he said when i said stop and he began to grow he said the church of the living god began to stand up you know brother daniel there's something that you that the holy spirit said to you today through you today and this really got my attention because as the lord had told me that and he said this we have arrived [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but you get a preacher up here can you imagine just for one moment and i'll let you go but imagine for one moment here are these these israelites yes they have been backed into a corner that's right that is threatening them when all of a sudden the father tells david yes go and take them some bread and cheese please sent him on a little trip but his purpose was multifaceted that's right yes glory lauri i can just imagine the moment that he heard goliaths speaking those threats and something began to move come on you're not just any kind of people that's right you are the pride of jesus christ amen by the words that were spoken the church has now risen up yes there ain't no devil there ain't no [Applause] giants [Applause] that's why satan wants to get you out of the way he wants to keep you down why because he knows the power that lays inside the church now i tell you if you are ready how many are ready now imagine here when little david walked up and he heard those threatenings by that giant a little bitty guy come here little bitty guy yeah that's okay god can use a little bitty guy hey man lauren's there and he got sick and tired of seeing the enemy throwing the enemies threatening do you know what david said [Music] fiber right [Applause] [Applause] yesterday about brother brown talking about the translation of the books and tapes and all that how do you remember that [Applause] do you know what he was looking at he was looking at you and i [Applause] whoa looking down through time and sit down now we understand we're not the only ones but i'm talking to you today imagine him looking through time and him seeing a group of people that believe [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yes [Applause] foreign we are in the kitchen he saw me [Applause] god and i want you to understand this the next time that giant comes he's already defeated yeah christ already defeated him and if christ lives in you then the mighty conqueror is in you and you become a conqueror to him yeah and therefore the next time you have an issue whatever your pro whatever your giant was you look him straight in the eyes and say i've arrived [Applause] i'm going to tell you you're going to see in your life the lord told me this already yes you're going to see in your life your faith muscles start to grow glory you thought you were just a well jim just a little church member and i don't know you know nobody sees me oh the lord sees each one again [Music] come on yeah [Applause] come on come on and the next time that giant comes laugh in his face that's right i don't care if it's depression or this off we give give it all kinds of names because not today [Applause] you got to keep this fire going right yes yeah is that right yes now we know one thing that the word of god doesn't need to be anointed no that's right it's already annoying it's us that got to get in line so that the anointing comes upon us that's right you you've got something to do you can't just kick back with a glass of tea and say okay lord give me everything that no no you're gonna do a little something the word don't need your help that's right all the word wants is for you to get the word and eat the little book yes am i hearing you hear me take the word and hear it faith comes by hearing and the hearing of the word of god eat the word once it's inside of you it doesn't have to ask you anything it knows what to do let the word come inside you when it does you'll see every time that different spirit comes up or a different giant comes up you'll look around you'll say not today that's right yes sir not today i don't even know who he's messing with all right somebody said he ain't even got keys to his own house [Applause] [Music] you know this brother brown says revivals don't last for over what three years that's right then brother branham says in another place but this has been going on was it 12 or 15 years because this revival is not going out going around for everybody it's not for the church that's right this is for the [Applause] pride um we are very grateful to god because as he was talking about placing these these uh these stones you know there are some precious people here 1976 i was a little boy don't ask me what they preached about but they were long services i was sitting right where you all were sitting and i will fall asleep all the time so right where you're sitting now was sitting somewhere around here and i fell asleep and that was a brother that preached six hours [Applause] you guys can handle that oh yes but there was something that was planted in us from the little children and you know that 1976 there are a few of the older warriors that are still with us sorry they are still standing for the gospels wait in the back my aunt nika uncle mike would you stand these are these are foreign [Applause] we were here scripture to show my goodness we have come back to where these stones they were made and i see oh wow
